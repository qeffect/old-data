  <text start="40.739" dur="3.601">with patients which is you know a front</text>
  <text start="42.96" dur="3.84">from sort of a working man&amp;#39;s perspective</text>
  <text start="44.34" dur="4.23">I have respect for that you know and</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="3.06">from sort of an educators perspective I</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="4.35">have I have great respect for somebody</text>
  <text start="49.86" dur="4.379">who can manage both and also your author</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="6.209">you said this is your first book</text>
  <text start="54.239" dur="6.48">abundant health in a toxic world so how</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="3.211">is it with your first actual II recently</text>
  <text start="60.719" dur="3.451">had a personal experience too but how</text>
  <text start="62.34" dur="3.93">was your your experience with this first</text>
  <text start="64.17" dur="3.6">book and you know feel free to kind of</text>
  <text start="66.27" dur="3.68">introduce yourself and let people know</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="7.5">you know what kind of person you are and</text>
  <text start="69.95" dur="6.61">anything on this well I had a lot of</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="3.87">people over the years that have asked me</text>
  <text start="76.56" dur="4.5">what I specialize in and I sort of</text>
  <text start="79.14" dur="3.479">turned it into what wasn&amp;#39;t designed to</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="4.11">be a joke but it&amp;#39;s sort of a little cute</text>
  <text start="82.619" dur="4.081">I said if you&amp;#39;re truly holistic okay if</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="4.019">you&amp;#39;re not a doctor that&amp;#39;s a specialist</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="4.559">in oncology or cardiology or diabetes or</text>
  <text start="89.189" dur="4.411">neurology if you&amp;#39;re truly holistic</text>
  <text start="91.259" dur="4.711">you&amp;#39;re helping the body to heal itself</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="4.5">and therefore specializing is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="4.98">I specialize in helping you get well</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="4.71">because if your body knows what it needs</text>
  <text start="100.95" dur="4.02">to do and if we can remove the</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="3.72">impediments to healing change your diet</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="2.85">in the ways that your body would like us</text>
  <text start="106.53" dur="2.82">to and if they could tell you you would</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="3.839">have done it a long time ago or maybe</text>
  <text start="109.35" dur="3.9">not and breathe and bring in all the</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="3.061">nutrients that you&amp;#39;re missing and start</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="2.85">pulling all the poisons out that nobody</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="2.969">else seems to be addressing correctly</text>
  <text start="116.1" dur="4.32">then your body is going to start working</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="4.521">on healing and so I just like people to</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.26">understand that that specialization</text>
  <text start="122.21" dur="5.259">really has no place in holistic health</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="4.829">specialist its Asian area brought up</text>
  <text start="127.469" dur="3.931">those in allopathic drug based health</text>
  <text start="129.509" dur="3.991">yeah it&amp;#39;s a very broad approach whereas</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="5.13">you know the typical like allopathic is</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="4.23">cut poison and we&amp;#39;re trying to sort of</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="2.51">heal the body from the ground-up</text>
  <text start="137.73" dur="4.35">base-level</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="4.51">and you know before we dive into you</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="2.7">know you the details of your broken stop</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="2.82">not really we&amp;#39;re gonna go to some</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="4.04">details of some of the you know the</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="5.31">health aspect of nature pantheon and</text>
  <text start="148.82" dur="4.87">holistic medicine but I kind of on a</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="3.99">personal note you know I dive into both</text>
  <text start="153.69" dur="3.81">politics and I so just have to straddle</text>
  <text start="155.67" dur="4.08">those two topics and obviously they sort</text>
  <text start="157.5" dur="4.95">of connect and unfortunately that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.75" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s my calling but politically</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="3.27">speaking I feel like most of the problem</text>
  <text start="164.16" dur="4.47">is not in the available information</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="4.32">which is sort of there but it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="4.05">disinformation and the control</text>
  <text start="170.04" dur="4.14">mechanisms at a political level do you</text>
  <text start="172.68" dur="7.92">have any kind of thoughts on that or how</text>
  <text start="174.18" dur="8.97">we need address that big question yeah</text>
  <text start="180.6" dur="5.22">we could we could disband Congress and</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="5.79">start a an entirely new Congress in</text>
  <text start="185.82" dur="7.98">which everybody was told or taught or</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="7.049">whatever that if it was found that they</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="4.14">were not doing those things that they</text>
  <text start="195.989" dur="4.071">told all the people that they wanted to</text>
  <text start="197.94" dur="5.13">vote for them that they were going to do</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="5.29">then they would simply get canned within</text>
  <text start="203.07" dur="5.04">six months or less and we&amp;#39;d bring in new</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="4.109">people and as soon as everybody started</text>
  <text start="208.11" dur="2.52">getting canned over and over and over</text>
  <text start="209.459" dur="3.151">again for not doing what they claimed</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="3.9">then we would have things you know</text>
  <text start="212.61" dur="3.93">change a lot but but right now you know</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="4.739">we have for example we&amp;#39;ve got a number</text>
  <text start="216.54" dur="6.75">of people good people in Congress who</text>
  <text start="219.269" dur="6.121">have presented to Congress that we need</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="5.1">to have better medicine that we need to</text>
  <text start="225.39" dur="5.31">have true regulations that we need to</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="4.02">not lie to the public about things like</text>
  <text start="230.7" dur="3.24">mercury and lead and arsenic and</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="4.2">vaccines and we need to tell the truth</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="4.59">but it never happens and the only way it</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="3.54">would happen is if the people that</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t do it they were supposed to or</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="4.83">somehow you know fired but as we all</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="4.619">know just reading the newspaper if you</text>
  <text start="244.98" dur="4.47">have even a person that&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s say a</text>
  <text start="247.049" dur="5.611">CEO of a major corporation and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="249.45" dur="5.069">been caught in massive fraud doing all</text>
  <text start="252.66" dur="3.78">sorts of things they&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="254.519" dur="3.391">do they get fired and the next thing you</text>
  <text start="256.44" dur="3.57">hear about them three weeks later is</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="4.53">they got their multi-million dollar</text>
  <text start="260.01" dur="4.409">retirement package even after defrauding</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="3.96">the public and now they&amp;#39;re working as a</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="5.821">CEO for another company</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="5.91">with a package of funding coming in just</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="4.02">as big it has how do we ever move</text>
  <text start="272.31" dur="4.2">forward with that so we need negative</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="6">consequences for bad - or evil doers and</text>
  <text start="276.51" dur="6.06">and I I would almost argue that we sort</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="6.87">of need more protection and incentive</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="6.45">structure for organizing good guys we</text>
  <text start="287.13" dur="3.42">have so many voices that are islands and</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="4.32">often they get sort of railroaded by the</text>
  <text start="290.55" dur="5.52">system or Tory or dead or something like</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="6.09">that mysteriously you know often in</text>
  <text start="296.07" dur="5.849">Florida near me so that&amp;#39;s weird you know</text>
  <text start="299.43" dur="5.04">maybe maybe I hit some point we could</text>
  <text start="301.919" dur="4.261">bring together all of the voices or</text>
  <text start="304.47" dur="3.96">something and sort of form some sort of</text>
  <text start="306.18" dur="4.5">group or coalition we could I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="5.58">get some sort of a change what do you</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="4.59">think that would that would be helpful I</text>
  <text start="314.01" dur="3.42">think probably the first thing that</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="4.59">would need to be done otherwise we</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="5.269">probably won&amp;#39;t get anywhere is the</text>
  <text start="319.86" dur="5.76">citizens united needs to be reversed</text>
  <text start="322.699" dur="6.131">nobody we we need to not have PAC groups</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="6.21">able to decide who gets elected but more</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="5.76">importantly we have to reverse the</text>
  <text start="331.83" dur="5.22">principle that a corporation is a person</text>
  <text start="334.59" dur="4.65">because a corporation cannot be</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="4.2">handcuffed a corporation cannot be put</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="4.41">in jail and therefore a corporation is</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="5.61">not a person and so if somebody is a CEO</text>
  <text start="343.65" dur="5.22">CFO a vice president or some loli for</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="3.84">whatever it is if somebody in could be</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="3.78">the FDA could be the CDC could be</text>
  <text start="350.7" dur="4.05">Monsanto could be bear could be any</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="4.88">corporation if somebody in a corporation</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="6.02">does something that has been shown to be</text>
  <text start="357.53" dur="5.68">horrible awful and has hurt or killed</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="4.54">thousands or millions of people the idea</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="4.2">that you cannot sue that person because</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="4.859">they are simply an employee and you must</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="4.379">instead sue the corporation that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="370.169" dur="4.891">totally ridiculous you should always be</text>
  <text start="371.789" dur="5.341">able to sue somebody who put out a an</text>
  <text start="375.06" dur="3.81">idea that needed to be followed even</text>
  <text start="377.13" dur="3.78">though he&amp;#39;s just an employee because if</text>
  <text start="378.87" dur="4.229">he or she says this needs to be done and</text>
  <text start="380.91" dur="3.6">a bunch of people die you can&amp;#39;t just say</text>
  <text start="383.099" dur="3.241">well you can&amp;#39;t sue me I mean that came</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="4.89">down from somebody above me no you can</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="5.25">sue every single person that had any</text>
  <text start="389.4" dur="4.71">part in hurting people and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.59" dur="4.05">have to sue the corporation sure yeah I</text>
  <text start="394.11" dur="3.09">believe in sort of individual</text>
  <text start="395.64" dur="2.579">responsibility for these crimes I think</text>
  <text start="397.2" dur="1.75">that would sort of have a chilling</text>
  <text start="398.219" dur="4.811">effect on</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="6.3">evil overall you know and I&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="403.03" dur="4.05">say I think I think there is something</text>
  <text start="405.25" dur="4.11">to the whole bringing voices together</text>
  <text start="407.08" dur="4.02">because that also lets us expose those</text>
  <text start="409.36" dur="3.27">guys when they move from one corporation</text>
  <text start="411.1" dur="4.2">to the next as public the public has a</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="5.46">short memory especially in the USA for</text>
  <text start="415.3" dur="5.61">issues like this and it sort of takes a</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="7.23">sustained effort I think I don&amp;#39;t know to</text>
  <text start="420.91" dur="5.76">get anywhere with things so you know we</text>
  <text start="425.32" dur="3">want to dive into your book as well but</text>
  <text start="426.67" dur="2.88">are there any particular issues that</text>
  <text start="428.32" dur="2.91">where you would like to start or</text>
  <text start="429.55" dur="6.93">anything closer to your heart I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="431.23" dur="11.31">let you kind of lead the way practice</text>
  <text start="436.48" dur="7.88">practitioner myself sorry go ahead that</text>
  <text start="442.54" dur="6.27">are hurting everybody on this planet</text>
  <text start="444.36" dur="7.3">include the mercury which is in more</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="4.56">than 50% of the silver fillings that are</text>
  <text start="451.66" dur="3.21">in everybody&amp;#39;s mouth and yet in our</text>
  <text start="453.37" dur="3">country it&amp;#39;s still legal to put them in</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="3.42">you can&amp;#39;t put mercury in paint</text>
  <text start="456.37" dur="3.66">you can&amp;#39;t put mercury in quiet switches</text>
  <text start="458.29" dur="3.27">you can&amp;#39;t put them until switches in</text>
  <text start="460.03" dur="3.42">your car because it&amp;#39;s one of the most</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="3.33">poisonous substances in the world but</text>
  <text start="463.45" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s still totally legal to put it in</text>
  <text start="464.89" dur="3.03">your mouth and have it paper eyes into</text>
  <text start="466.69" dur="4.56">your brain all day long in your body</text>
  <text start="467.92" dur="4.89">also there&amp;#39;s one poison I thought I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="3.21">interrupt real fast I&amp;#39;d add to that I</text>
  <text start="472.81" dur="4.53">think I heard that you can put a drop in</text>
  <text start="474.46" dur="5.55">a lake and make sake it&amp;#39;s like toxic you</text>
  <text start="477.34" dur="4.5">know like for for fish and stuff I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="480.01" dur="4.83">I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s true but it is</text>
  <text start="481.84" dur="5.37">very bad so I go ahead it took the</text>
  <text start="484.84" dur="5.31">amount of mercury in one drop of mercury</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="4.41">and you vaporized it into a building the</text>
  <text start="490.15" dur="3.18">building would be evaporated would be</text>
  <text start="491.62" dur="3.36">evacuated if they knew that hazmat would</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="3.75">come in it would be totally evacuated</text>
  <text start="494.98" dur="3.6">and they would be doing testing of all</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="2.61">sorts of different kinds but they can</text>
  <text start="498.58" dur="3.6">have much more than that in your mouth</text>
  <text start="499.69" dur="5.01">so there&amp;#39;s a poison that&amp;#39;s still legal</text>
  <text start="502.18" dur="4.41">to be used all the time and that most of</text>
  <text start="504.7" dur="4.05">the public doesn&amp;#39;t realize how bad it is</text>
  <text start="506.59" dur="4.17">another one would be fluoride there</text>
  <text start="508.75" dur="3.99">isn&amp;#39;t a single properly done research</text>
  <text start="510.76" dur="4.32">study that has ever shown that</text>
  <text start="512.74" dur="4.56">fluoridated water in any way reduces</text>
  <text start="515.08" dur="3.96">tooth decay and our own Environmental</text>
  <text start="517.3" dur="4.17">Protection Agency scientists and the</text>
  <text start="519.04" dur="5.28">entire union at the EPA has come out</text>
  <text start="521.47" dur="5.34">against water fluoridation over and over</text>
  <text start="524.32" dur="4.23">and over again and we still have it even</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="3.48">though 20 or 30 other countries have</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="4.09">pulled it out so we have all these</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="4">things that are going on where we are</text>
  <text start="532.64" dur="3.87">not being protected and I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="534.29" dur="4.08">lots of laws and I don&amp;#39;t like huge</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="4.53">amounts of regulations but you know come</text>
  <text start="538.37" dur="4.32">on I mean at some point somebody with</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="3.99">the power which I guess would have to be</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="4.53">our government has to say to the large</text>
  <text start="545.03" dur="4.46">corporations you know when something has</text>
  <text start="547.22" dur="4.23">been proven with a reasonable doubt</text>
  <text start="549.49" dur="4.6">we&amp;#39;re not gonna let you do it anymore</text>
  <text start="551.45" dur="4.59">and that just has never happened yet you</text>
  <text start="554.09" dur="3.33">know I do think that we we need to</text>

  <text start="557.42" dur="3.36">government government level like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="558.98" dur="3.27">like for example vaccines you know they</text>
  <text start="560.78" dur="6.75">have banks in court they can pretty much</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="7.08">escape liability de facto but I disagree</text>
  <text start="567.53" dur="3.12">on the part about waiting kind of for</text>
  <text start="569.33" dur="4.31">the government I think that there are</text>
  <text start="570.65" dur="5.4">you know a few practical statement or</text>
  <text start="573.64" dur="4.57">approaches that we can kind of take to</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="4.53">almost force accountability to them I</text>
  <text start="578.21" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t know that I think this I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="580.58" dur="3.48">doing some some networking as far as the</text>
  <text start="582.44" dur="3.3">Free Speech Movement goes and I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="584.06" dur="3.12">to sort of build a coalition there and I</text>
  <text start="585.74" dur="3.24">think that maybe we could apply that in</text>
  <text start="587.18" dur="4.2">other areas as well if we had you know</text>
  <text start="588.98" dur="3.81">20 or 30 million voices at once sort of</text>
  <text start="591.38" dur="4.01">working together on a couple of key</text>
  <text start="592.79" dur="4.89">issues that are important to everyone</text>
  <text start="595.39" dur="3.76">you know like alternative health and</text>
  <text start="597.68" dur="3.9">stuff I mean we could sort of pushing</text>
  <text start="599.15" dur="7.32">things through without waiting on them</text>
  <text start="601.58" dur="6.96">but I completely agree with that but you</text>
  <text start="606.47" dur="4.95">said it very very well just now you said</text>
  <text start="608.54" dur="6.33">20 or 30 million voices and the problem</text>
  <text start="611.42" dur="5.25">that I see continually is that we have a</text>
  <text start="614.87" dur="3.24">lot of sheep out there that believe what</text>
  <text start="616.67" dur="3.77">they&amp;#39;re told by the media and by their</text>
  <text start="618.11" dur="4.14">doctor and all of the various different</text>
  <text start="620.44" dur="3.91">organizations that are trying to mold</text>
  <text start="622.25" dur="5.49">our beliefs the way they want to and</text>
  <text start="624.35" dur="5.73">because of that it&amp;#39;s not hard to get you</text>
  <text start="627.74" dur="4.65">know 10 or 20,000 but when you want to</text>
  <text start="630.08" dur="3.9">get 20 or 30 million it&amp;#39;s very difficult</text>
  <text start="632.39" dur="4.29">because most of the people have been</text>
  <text start="633.98" dur="5.4">incorrectly given knowledge that is</text>
  <text start="636.68" dur="4.5">wrong by ignorant people or by people</text>
  <text start="639.38" dur="3.36">that do know and they&amp;#39;re still trying to</text>
  <text start="641.18" dur="3.72">push us in the wrong direction in wrong</text>
  <text start="642.74" dur="4.47">direction so yes I think you&amp;#39;re correct</text>
  <text start="644.9" dur="3.09">if we could get 20 or 30 million like</text>
  <text start="647.21" dur="2.88">with vaccines</text>
  <text start="647.99" dur="4.83">I mean they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve pulled some of</text>
  <text start="650.09" dur="4.2">the best vaccine videos off the web in</text>
  <text start="652.82" dur="3.78">violation of the First Amendment of</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="4.32">freedom of speech so I mean it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="656.6" dur="3.6">really hard but yes absolutely I agree</text>
  <text start="658.61" dur="3.98">with you if we can do it with people</text>
  <text start="660.2" dur="6.329">that is absolutely a better way to do it</text>
  <text start="662.59" dur="5.53">planned annoying count on you okay so</text>
  <text start="666.529" dur="3.87">when I start networking these things I</text>
  <text start="668.12" dur="3.81">want to know all right so I&amp;#39;m gonna let</text>
  <text start="670.399" dur="4.021">you kind of take the the floor and run</text>
  <text start="671.93" dur="4.589">with it I am glad that you like that</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="3.839">idea though I was kind of I wanted to</text>
  <text start="676.519" dur="3.06">get your thoughts on it but I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="678.259" dur="2.31">sort of doing a lot of thoughts you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.579" dur="2.7">in this area</text>
  <text start="680.569" dur="3.481">on the backend lately with the</text>
  <text start="682.279" dur="3.711">networking and such</text>
  <text start="684.05" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t want to say too much yet but</text>
  <text start="685.99" dur="4.509">please go ahead and kind of take the</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="4.019">floor and kind of guide us through the</text>
  <text start="690.499" dur="3.991">inspiration behind your book as well if</text>
  <text start="692.749" dur="3.301">you don&amp;#39;t mind rather than just the</text>
  <text start="694.49" dur="3.509">details and facts like we want to get</text>
  <text start="696.05" dur="3.63">some of the nuggets as well of wisdom</text>
  <text start="697.999" dur="4.261">but sort of I like to hear the story</text>
  <text start="699.68" dur="5.52">behind as well</text>
  <text start="702.26" dur="4.98">sure well you know based basically I</text>
  <text start="705.2" dur="3.36">mean I&amp;#39;ve been doing this for many many</text>
  <text start="707.24" dur="3.06">decades I&amp;#39;ve seen thousands of people</text>

  <text start="726.74" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re still telling people to have a</text>

  <text start="751.55" dur="4.26">you know people talk about we have to do</text>
  <text start="753.68" dur="4.29">detox we should you know reduce the</text>
  <text start="755.81" dur="5.43">amount of poisons in our body and nobody</text>

  <text start="858.8" dur="4.98">natural because natural is not a</text>
  <text start="861.02" dur="4.35">legislated term in the United States so</text>
  <text start="863.78" dur="3.48">you can buy something that says natural</text>

  <text start="889.7" dur="4.29">to learn this stuff you have to</text>
  <text start="891.47" dur="7.74">understand that the statement that even</text>
  <text start="893.99" dur="6.63">today both doctors nurses and nutrition</text>
  <text start="899.21" dur="3.87">professionals most of which are</text>
  <text start="900.62" dur="5.4">registered dieticians and they are all</text>
  <text start="903.08" dur="5.34">three still taught that if you eat a</text>
  <text start="906.02" dur="4.38">well-balanced meal of adequate calories</text>
  <text start="908.42" dur="4.23">you will not be deficient in any</text>
  <text start="910.4" dur="3.9">essential nutrients now there are no</text>
  <text start="912.65" dur="3.48">studies that have ever validated that</text>
  <text start="914.3" dur="3.99">not a single one every study that was</text>
  <text start="916.13" dur="6.27">done has proven that regardless of your</text>
  <text start="918.29" dur="5.37">diet there are multiple vitamin and</text>
  <text start="922.4" dur="2.79">mineral deficiencies but they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="923.66" dur="3.45">saying that so people don&amp;#39;t think they</text>
  <text start="925.19" dur="3.11">need a multivitamin as a matter of fact</text>
  <text start="927.11" dur="2.94">there are studies out that say</text>
  <text start="928.3" dur="3.85">multivitamins are a waste of your money</text>
  <text start="930.05" dur="3.81">and this study shows it and that study</text>
  <text start="932.15" dur="3">shows it but if you read the studies</text>
  <text start="933.86" dur="3.12">because I go by them and read the whole</text>
  <text start="935.15" dur="3.9">study if you read the study you find out</text>
  <text start="936.98" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s a piece of garbage study they had</text>
  <text start="939.05" dur="3.84">maybe ten thousand people for ten years</text>
  <text start="941" dur="3.39">that they were following and one of the</text>
  <text start="942.89" dur="5.49">questions on the questionnaire that they</text>
  <text start="944.39" dur="8.04">got was do you take a multivitamin check</text>
  <text start="948.38" dur="6.39">off yes or check off no I&amp;#39;m sorry that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="952.43" dur="3.66">not a study you don&amp;#39;t know what multi</text>
  <text start="954.77" dur="2.67">you don&amp;#39;t know if it was a piece of</text>
  <text start="956.09" dur="1.86">garbage you don&amp;#39;t know how well they</text>
  <text start="957.44" dur="2.61">took it</text>
  <text start="957.95" dur="4.29">you couldn&amp;#39;t study a drug that way do I</text>
  <text start="960.05" dur="3.84">need to know what the drug is how much</text>
  <text start="962.24" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re taking how often they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="963.89" dur="3.03">they get phone calls all the time</text>
  <text start="965.24" dur="3.54">did they get followed and this is just</text>
  <text start="966.92" dur="2.4">do you take a multivitamin you can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="968.78" dur="2.07">that</text>
  <text start="969.32" dur="3.57">so most of the research that gets done</text>
  <text start="970.85" dur="4.14">on vitamins that gets to the public</text>
  <text start="972.89" dur="3.33">which is multivitamins don&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="974.99" dur="4.68">vitamin E doesn&amp;#39;t reduce heart disease</text>
  <text start="976.22" dur="5.22">etc etc more studies that nobody that</text>
  <text start="979.67" dur="4.05">understands research would ever have</text>
  <text start="981.44" dur="3.99">allowed to reach the public so people</text>
  <text start="983.72" dur="3.57">need to understand they need to find</text>
  <text start="985.43" dur="3.21">somebody to work with because they need</text>
  <text start="987.29" dur="3.18">more nutrients than they&amp;#39;re getting in</text>
  <text start="988.64" dur="4.32">their food they need to find out what</text>
  <text start="990.47" dur="4.23">the difference is between somebody</text>
  <text start="992.96" dur="4.5">eating well and somebody not eating well</text>
  <text start="994.7" dur="5.64">that that needs to be extrapolated to</text>
  <text start="997.46" dur="4.83">your food so if you can accept which</text>
  <text start="1000.34" dur="4.38">which most people will accept that if</text>
  <text start="1002.29" dur="4.35">you eat healthier you will be healthier</text>
  <text start="1004.72" dur="4.56">well but hold on a minute</text>
  <text start="1006.64" dur="5.22">how about what you&amp;#39;re eating it needs to</text>
  <text start="1009.28" dur="7.08">have eaten healthier also so if cattle</text>
  <text start="1011.86" dur="7.02">and sheep if their natural diet is grass</text>
  <text start="1016.36" dur="4.56">and weeds then you want them to be</text>
  <text start="1018.88" dur="4.08">eating grass and weeds before you eat</text>
  <text start="1020.92" dur="4.23">them because if they&amp;#39;re eating corn and</text>
  <text start="1022.96" dur="4.32">grain and soybeans they will have</text>
  <text start="1025.15" dur="3.689">totally incorrect fatty acids in their</text>
  <text start="1027.28" dur="4.559">body and now you&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="1028.839" dur="4.711">healthy by eating an unhealthy animal or</text>
  <text start="1031.839" dur="3.211">maybe by eating a fruit or vegetable</text>
  <text start="1033.55" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s been sprayed with all sorts of</text>
  <text start="1035.05" dur="4.74">poisons you&amp;#39;re eating an unhealthy piece</text>
  <text start="1037.27" dur="3.9">of produce so people need to go one step</text>
  <text start="1039.79" dur="5.58">further and realize what you&amp;#39;re eating</text>
  <text start="1041.17" dur="6.24">it also needs to have been in taking or</text>
  <text start="1045.37" dur="4.05">eating I know obviously plants don&amp;#39;t eat</text>
  <text start="1047.41" dur="3.51">but let&amp;#39;s say they eat they also need to</text>
  <text start="1049.42" dur="4.41">have been eating what&amp;#39;s good for them</text>
  <text start="1050.92" dur="4.89">and then you need to find out what are</text>
  <text start="1053.83" dur="4.49">the substances that you would like to</text>
  <text start="1055.81" dur="5.64">try to avoid in the stuff in your house</text>
  <text start="1058.32" dur="4.45">but yeah well it&amp;#39;s gonna save you know I</text>
  <text start="1061.45" dur="3.24">have a little bit of Agriculture in me</text>
  <text start="1062.77" dur="3.96">as well so you know you have to take it</text>
  <text start="1064.69" dur="3.72">from a soil up foundation and kind of</text>
  <text start="1066.73" dur="3.39">feed the soil and that feeds to the</text>
  <text start="1068.41" dur="3.09">nutrition then all the way up the food</text>
  <text start="1070.12" dur="3.66">chain keeps everything healthy and</text>
  <text start="1071.5" dur="3.84">resistant and I kind of - what you were</text>
  <text start="1073.78" dur="3.75">talking earlier I want to always sort of</text>
  <text start="1075.34" dur="4.41">use the example of a car you know and</text>
  <text start="1077.53" dur="3.75">you can have a good quality fuel or you</text>
  <text start="1079.75" dur="3.72">can sort of have a fuel that has water</text>
  <text start="1081.28" dur="4.83">and stuff in it and that&amp;#39;s quality of</text>
  <text start="1083.47" dur="5.37">diets and then with toxins you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1086.11" dur="5.52">pouring sand in to your tank basically</text>
  <text start="1088.84" dur="4.14">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s something that many</text>
  <text start="1091.63" dur="5.7">people can kind of just visualize</text>
  <text start="1092.98" dur="7.38">immediately but is bad I use I use a car</text>
  <text start="1097.33" dur="4.59">for for a slightly different example</text>
  <text start="1100.36" dur="2.34">that it came up when one of my patients</text>
  <text start="1101.92" dur="3.57">came</text>
  <text start="1102.7" dur="4.47">and I said so is your husband at all</text>
  <text start="1105.49" dur="2.88">interested in the fact that we&amp;#39;ve now</text>
  <text start="1107.17" dur="3.27">gotten rid of two or three of your</text>
  <text start="1108.37" dur="3.81">conditions by you know changing your</text>
  <text start="1110.44" dur="3.57">diet and bring things in you know change</text>
  <text start="1112.18" dur="4.59">bring in different nutrients is he is he</text>
  <text start="1114.01" dur="4.56">at all interested and have we helped him</text>
  <text start="1116.77" dur="3.93">because he also had a bunch of health</text>
  <text start="1118.57" dur="3.48">problems and she said actually I</text>
  <text start="1120.7" dur="3.33">mentioned that to him the other day and</text>
  <text start="1122.05" dur="6.51">she said he looked me right in the face</text>
  <text start="1124.03" dur="7.53">and said honey I don&amp;#39;t do do prevention</text>
  <text start="1128.56" dur="6.39">if I have a problem I will see my doctor</text>
  <text start="1131.56" dur="5.46">I don&amp;#39;t do prevention and I said would</text>

  <text start="1137.02" dur="3.87">it came from you because I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1139.18" dur="3.3">get the two of you angry at each other I</text>
  <text start="1140.89" dur="3.72">want him to understand this comes</text>
  <text start="1142.48" dur="4.2">completely from David get-off would you</text>
  <text start="1144.61" dur="5.19">tell him that you told me that and that</text>
  <text start="1146.68" dur="5.94">my answer was really uh that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1149.8" dur="5.73">complete and utter misrepresentation of</text>
  <text start="1152.62" dur="5.82">the way he lives he does prevention many</text>
  <text start="1155.53" dur="5.52">many times a year and I&amp;#39;m very sad that</text>
  <text start="1158.44" dur="5.25">his automobiles are more important than</text>
  <text start="1161.05" dur="6.21">his own body because if he wants to</text>
  <text start="1163.69" dur="5.73">claim that he doesn&amp;#39;t do prevention then</text>
  <text start="1167.26" dur="3.93">starting this year he is no longer</text>
  <text start="1169.42" dur="4.74">allowed to change the oil on his car</text>
  <text start="1171.19" dur="4.26">because that is never done because as an</text>
  <text start="1174.16" dur="3.99">issue that is a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="1175.45" dur="4.5">prevention and she said I love that I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1188.23" dur="4.29">not gonna do it on my body so you know</text>
  <text start="1190.3" dur="3.72">what do you do with some people that are</text>
  <text start="1192.52" dur="5.1">I mean I hate to say the word bit of</text>
  <text start="1194.02" dur="5.88">that stupid yeah so basically at the end</text>
  <text start="1197.62" dur="3.9">of the day yeah stubborn people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1199.9" dur="3.99">care how to dunk hold it he would always</text>

  <text start="1208.63" dur="5.37">I want to live okay yes maybe but your</text>
  <text start="1212.44" dur="6.45">quality of life is gonna be highly</text>
  <text start="1214" dur="7.32">impacted and that&amp;#39;s kind of a and what I</text>
  <text start="1218.89" dur="5.12">would I like people to understand</text>
  <text start="1221.32" dur="5.73">because very often you&amp;#39;ll hear the the</text>
  <text start="1224.01" dur="5.95">the phrase we&amp;#39;re all going to die of</text>
  <text start="1227.05" dur="5.73">something and my answer is that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1229.96" dur="5.25">the point the point is when you die</text>
  <text start="1232.78" dur="3.36">would you like to be able to look back</text>
  <text start="1235.21" dur="5.4">at the pre</text>
  <text start="1236.14" dur="8.22">is ten years and say wow I felt great I</text>
  <text start="1240.61" dur="5.4">had no pain I was on no drugs I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1244.36" dur="3.99">need to have somebody you know take me</text>

  <text start="1249.01" dur="4.89">I could play cards or Scrabble or go</text>
  <text start="1251.559" dur="6.99">bowling or would you like to look at the</text>
  <text start="1253.9" dur="6.75">past ten years and go cheese I know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1258.549" dur="3.901">glad I&amp;#39;m finally I&amp;#39;m finally in hospice</text>
  <text start="1260.65" dur="4.47">and dying because I haven&amp;#39;t had a good</text>
  <text start="1262.45" dur="4.41">time or you know really felt good for</text>
  <text start="1265.12" dur="3.42">years and years and years that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1266.86" dur="3.93">difference between doing all the right</text>
  <text start="1268.54" dur="4.08">things you know I I have no idea how</text>
  <text start="1270.79" dur="4.17">long I&amp;#39;m going to live I mean if I had</text>
  <text start="1272.62" dur="3.75">my druthers it would be nine hundred but</text>
  <text start="1274.96" dur="3.599">if not I mean I&amp;#39;ll take a hundred I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1276.37" dur="5.939">take 95 I&amp;#39;ll take whatever but I want to</text>
  <text start="1278.559" dur="6.961">make certain that during the last ten</text>
  <text start="1282.309" dur="5.221">years I feel great I have my memory I</text>
  <text start="1285.52" dur="4.17">can still lecture if I want to I can</text>
  <text start="1287.53" dur="4.38">play cards or Scrabble I don&amp;#39;t have pain</text>
  <text start="1289.69" dur="4.56">anywhere and I&amp;#39;m probably hopefully not</text>
  <text start="1291.91" dur="4.47">on any prescription drugs I&amp;#39;m 67 now</text>
  <text start="1294.25" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ve never been on any first trips on</text>
  <text start="1296.38" dur="5.46">drugs for anything and you know I used</text>
  <text start="1298.27" dur="6.42">food and herbs and homeopathic sand</text>
  <text start="1301.84" dur="5.1">nutrients and it&amp;#39;s just it makes more</text>
  <text start="1304.69" dur="4.83">sense why would anybody not want to do</text>
  <text start="1306.94" dur="5.52">those things I don&amp;#39;t quite understand</text>
  <text start="1309.52" dur="4.409">yeah I think it really is in many cases</text>
  <text start="1312.46" dur="4.11">sort of a lack of understanding and</text>
  <text start="1313.929" dur="4.38">really getting it but in a visceral and</text>
  <text start="1316.57" dur="3.18">emotional sort of personal way for me he</text>
  <text start="1318.309" dur="3.181">was watching my grandparents fall apart</text>
  <text start="1319.75" dur="3.51">and their health and the choices that</text>
  <text start="1321.49" dur="5.36">they made that&amp;#39;s kind of what started my</text>
  <text start="1323.26" dur="7.049">path but you know I gotta say</text>
  <text start="1326.85" dur="7.48">information maybe is the easy part but</text>
  <text start="1330.309" dur="6.301">but people need to be almost sort of</text>
  <text start="1334.33" dur="4.56">brought to a state of like fear you know</text>
  <text start="1336.61" dur="4.11">like sort of scared into it maybe and</text>
  <text start="1338.89" dur="4.8">you talk about sort of that difference</text>
  <text start="1340.72" dur="5.4">in quality of life you know that is such</text>
  <text start="1343.69" dur="4.619">a massive place of suffering in this in</text>
  <text start="1346.12" dur="4.439">this world I mean so many people just</text>
  <text start="1348.309" dur="3.841">sort of fade away and then do so in</text>
  <text start="1350.559" dur="3.36">misery and they just don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="1352.15" dur="7.1">why and their doctors are just given</text>
  <text start="1353.919" dur="5.331">them more more problems in a pill form</text>
  <text start="1360.05" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s more problems in a pill form</text>
  <text start="1361.73" dur="4.41">because every pill has side effects and</text>
  <text start="1364.07" dur="4.44">very often they&amp;#39;re treating one side</text>
  <text start="1366.14" dur="4.53">effect from pill with another pill with</text>
  <text start="1368.51" dur="3.39">another side effect I&amp;#39;ve got a fairly</text>
  <text start="1370.67" dur="2.79">large number of people that when they</text>
  <text start="1371.9" dur="3.3">came in for their initial consultation</text>
  <text start="1373.46" dur="3.48">and my initial consultations for hours</text>
  <text start="1375.2" dur="3.24">they come in for initial consultation</text>
  <text start="1376.94" dur="2.88">and they&amp;#39;ve said something like oh yeah</text>
  <text start="1378.44" dur="4.44">ever since that was 40 it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1379.82" dur="5.1">downhill ever since I was 45 was down</text>
  <text start="1382.88" dur="4.95">here ever since I was 50 was downhill</text>
  <text start="1384.92" dur="4.56">and I&amp;#39;m always older than all of those</text>
  <text start="1387.83" dur="3.3">patients and I&amp;#39;m not down here and I</text>
  <text start="1389.48" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t have any of their problems and so</text>
  <text start="1391.13" dur="4.2">my job is to say I understand that for</text>
  <text start="1393.62" dur="3.96">you from that time in your life it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1395.33" dur="4.38">been downhill now you&amp;#39;re in my office</text>
  <text start="1397.58" dur="4.83">and hopefully since you&amp;#39;ve been willing</text>
  <text start="1399.71" dur="3.75">to pay my fees and wait for all the</text>
  <text start="1402.41" dur="3.63">amount of time you have to wait to get</text>
  <text start="1403.46" dur="4.11">in to see me and knowing in advance that</text>
  <text start="1406.04" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;m gonna have you change your diet take</text>
  <text start="1407.57" dur="4.47">a whole bunch of supplements that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1409.13" dur="5.55">gonna start reversing all that and you</text>
  <text start="1412.04" dur="4.47">know you&amp;#39;ll understand that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1414.68" dur="3.39">what you when you were born</text>
  <text start="1416.51" dur="4.68">you know it&amp;#39;s not the date that you were</text>
  <text start="1418.07" dur="7.83">born is how you feel because we have a</text>
  <text start="1421.19" dur="6.44">chronological age and biological age and</text>
  <text start="1425.9" dur="5.34">there are a lot of people whose</text>
  <text start="1427.63" dur="5.5">chronological age is much larger than</text>
  <text start="1431.24" dur="4.2">their biological age so in other words</text>
  <text start="1433.13" dur="5.25">they were only that they were there born</text>
  <text start="1435.44" dur="6.18">40 years ago so their chronological age</text>
  <text start="1438.38" dur="5.67">is 40 but the health of their body is</text>
  <text start="1441.62" dur="4.14">like a 60 or 70 year old well I want to</text>
  <text start="1444.05" dur="3.72">reverse that I want to make it so that</text>
  <text start="1445.76" dur="5.19">your biological age the way your body is</text>
  <text start="1447.77" dur="5.19">operating is far less than how old you</text>
  <text start="1450.95" dur="4.56">actually are and that&amp;#39;s what I love to</text>
  <text start="1452.96" dur="4.56">do it&amp;#39;s just just a lot of fun we have</text>
  <text start="1455.51" dur="3.99">to talk about carbon 60 sometime all</text>
  <text start="1457.52" dur="3.99">right so you know what issue if I had to</text>
  <text start="1459.5" dur="3.99">ask a good question I would say what are</text>
  <text start="1461.51" dur="3.42">the top three issues that you face with</text>
  <text start="1463.49" dur="4.43">people other than they just don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1464.93" dur="5.85">to take these things they&amp;#39;re lazy</text>
  <text start="1467.92" dur="6.43">well I don&amp;#39;t face a lot of issues with</text>
  <text start="1470.78" dur="4.83">my patient just because the ones that</text>
  <text start="1474.35" dur="3.06">are willing to come to me after they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1475.61" dur="3.3">learned from whoever sent them you know</text>
  <text start="1477.41" dur="4.29">what they&amp;#39;re gonna have to do are</text>
  <text start="1478.91" dur="4.71">generally pretty compliant I get I get</text>
  <text start="1481.7" dur="4.71">compliant people that do what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1483.62" dur="5.34">supposed to do but the top three things</text>
  <text start="1486.41" dur="4.62">that are important are teaching people</text>
  <text start="1488.96" dur="4.93">what is and isn&amp;#39;t a healthy diet you</text>
  <text start="1491.03" dur="4.6">know which takes some time and showing</text>
  <text start="1493.89" dur="4.26">people which supplements are the</text>
  <text start="1495.63" dur="4.14">required ones basically for everybody</text>
  <text start="1498.15" dur="4.53">that wants long-term health in my book I</text>
  <text start="1499.77" dur="4.95">called the basic seven and the basic</text>
  <text start="1502.68" dur="4.47">seven are a really good multivitamin</text>
  <text start="1504.72" dur="4.2">multi-mineral formula never a one a day</text>
  <text start="1507.15" dur="3.63">because it won&amp;#39;t stay in your body all</text>
  <text start="1508.92" dur="3.75">day so even if they had all the right</text>
  <text start="1510.78" dur="3.42">things you still can&amp;#39;t do it one a day</text>
  <text start="1512.67" dur="2.91">because you&amp;#39;d have to take it with both</text>
  <text start="1514.2" dur="3.27">breakfast and dinner just to make sure</text>
  <text start="1515.58" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re there all day and then all the</text>
  <text start="1517.47" dur="4.92">things that you can&amp;#39;t put enough of into</text>
  <text start="1519.6" dur="5.16">a multivitamin either because it&amp;#39;s a fad</text>
  <text start="1522.39" dur="5.22">and it won&amp;#39;t it won&amp;#39;t stay in the in the</text>
  <text start="1524.76" dur="4.59">capsule or tablet or because the amount</text>
  <text start="1527.61" dur="3.78">would be more than anybody would be able</text>
  <text start="1529.35" dur="4.38">to fit into that number so my basic</text>
  <text start="1531.39" dur="4.11">seven for example are a good</text>
  <text start="1533.73" dur="7.67">multivitamin multi-mineral formula taken</text>
  <text start="1535.5" dur="9.42">twice a day and then extra a c d e e e</text>
  <text start="1541.4" dur="5.89">fish oil and a probiotic those are my</text>
  <text start="1544.92" dur="3.72">basic seven and I have to find the ones</text>
  <text start="1547.29" dur="2.7">that are best for that person because</text>
  <text start="1548.64" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re all different everybody is an</text>
  <text start="1549.99" dur="4.47">individual so you know the first two are</text>
  <text start="1552.72" dur="4.02">getting people to understand what the</text>
  <text start="1554.46" dur="4.68">right foods are game to understand that</text>
  <text start="1556.74" dur="4.29">margarine is toxic and butter is healthy</text>
  <text start="1559.14" dur="3.99">but we want the butter to be from cows</text>
  <text start="1561.03" dur="4.11">that were fed grass and we want the</text>
  <text start="1563.13" dur="4.77">coconut oil to be from organic coconut</text>
  <text start="1565.14" dur="5.69">trees and we want lard which is actually</text>
  <text start="1567.9" dur="5.55">a healthy fat if the pigs are heirloom</text>
  <text start="1570.83" dur="4">species of pigs and they were out there</text>
  <text start="1573.45" dur="2.37">where they&amp;#39;re supposed to be eating what</text>
  <text start="1574.83" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re supposed to be instead of the</text>
  <text start="1575.82" dur="3.93">garbage do we do so we&amp;#39;ve got diet</text>
  <text start="1577.74" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;ve got supplements and then we have</text>
  <text start="1579.75" dur="4.41">to teach people all the various</text>
  <text start="1581.61" dur="6.54">different toxic types of things that are</text>
  <text start="1584.16" dur="6.81">in our environment and the hardest one</text>
  <text start="1588.15" dur="4.68">lately although they&amp;#39;ve now elevated</text>
  <text start="1590.97" dur="3.3">vaccines up to be even the harder one</text>
  <text start="1592.83" dur="2.7">because they keep on pushing that</text>
  <text start="1594.27" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re good for you based on research</text>
  <text start="1595.53" dur="3.84">that doesn&amp;#39;t exist but the hardest one</text>
  <text start="1597.33" dur="4.11">lately is electric and electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="1599.37" dur="5.07">magnetic fields because we are being</text>
  <text start="1601.44" dur="5.1">bathed and I don&amp;#39;t mean we because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1604.44" dur="4.71">not talking about myself my building has</text>
  <text start="1606.54" dur="5.22">no Wi-Fi everything is hardwired with</text>

  <text start="1725.169" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t understand I&amp;#39;ll give you a really</text>
  <text start="1727" dur="4.559">good example that I guarantee none of</text>
  <text start="1729.309" dur="3.931">the people that are listening to to this</text>
  <text start="1731.559" dur="3.811">podcast of yours or whatever however</text>
  <text start="1733.24" dur="3.779">this is being promoted none of them have</text>
  <text start="1735.37" dur="4.32">thought about this probably not a single</text>
  <text start="1737.019" dur="4.711">one and that is that we have a little</text>
  <text start="1739.69" dur="5.04">thing in our house that as soon as one</text>
  <text start="1741.73" dur="6.059">of our cars hits 200,000 miles the next</text>
  <text start="1744.73" dur="4.71">major thing that has to be repaired we</text>
  <text start="1747.789" dur="4.951">decide if we&amp;#39;re gonna do it or get</text>
  <text start="1749.44" dur="6.42">another car and so a couple years ago my</text>
  <text start="1752.74" dur="5.279">wife&amp;#39;s Honda hit 229 thousand miles it</text>
  <text start="1755.86" dur="4.049">needed a major major repair for many</text>
  <text start="1758.019" dur="2.611">thousands of dollars and so we decided</text>
  <text start="1759.909" dur="3.51">to get her in the car</text>
  <text start="1760.63" dur="5.34">but before we did that I contacted one</text>
  <text start="1763.419" dur="5.191">of the world experts and by email and I</text>
  <text start="1765.97" dur="5.73">said have you tested the hybrids and the</text>
  <text start="1768.61" dur="7.049">electric cars and she emailed back when</text>
  <text start="1771.7" dur="5.76">they first came out so that would have</text>
  <text start="1775.659" dur="4.321">been probably the original Prius</text>
  <text start="1777.46" dur="4.92">versions she said when we first came out</text>
  <text start="1779.98" dur="4.679">we tested them and they had such high</text>
  <text start="1782.38" dur="4.38">fields you couldn&amp;#39;t pay me to own one</text>
  <text start="1784.659" dur="3.661">and I said thank you very much we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1786.76" dur="4.32">buying a hybrid or an electric car and</text>
  <text start="1788.32" dur="4.109">we bought a regular Toyota Corolla but</text>
  <text start="1791.08" dur="3.27">all the people that are driving around</text>
  <text start="1792.429" dur="4.561">in hybrids and electric cars they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1794.35" dur="6.63">have a clue that they might for example</text>
  <text start="1796.99" dur="5.97">have spent money to hardwire their</text>
  <text start="1800.98" dur="4.439">telephones and they may be turning off</text>
  <text start="1802.96" dur="3.959">their Wi-Fi at night because somebody</text>
  <text start="1805.419" dur="3.72">told them that that might be a good idea</text>
  <text start="1806.919" dur="3.63">to not bathe their body in these</text>
  <text start="1809.139" dur="2.77">microwave frequencies while they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1810.549" dur="3.801">sleeping</text>
  <text start="1811.909" dur="3.731">and now they&amp;#39;re driving around in a</text>
  <text start="1814.35" dur="2.4">little cage filled with these</text>
  <text start="1815.64" dur="2.49">frequencies and they don&amp;#39;t realize it</text>
  <text start="1816.75" dur="3.24">because none of this stuff gets talked</text>
  <text start="1818.13" dur="3.63">about because of where the</text>
  <text start="1819.99" dur="5.52">multibillion-dollar corporations are</text>
  <text start="1821.76" dur="5.31">putting their money wow I wish there if</text>
  <text start="1825.51" dur="3.6">I wonder if there&amp;#39;s a way to solve that</text>
  <text start="1827.07" dur="3.66">for people or just somehow like capture</text>
  <text start="1829.11" dur="4.289">it with a small device and some I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1830.73" dur="4.53">know just to solve problems that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1833.399" dur="3.361">I&amp;#39;m about that isn&amp;#39;t pretty scary though</text>
  <text start="1835.26" dur="4.98">I&amp;#39;ve heard that people are cooking in</text>
  <text start="1836.76" dur="5.7">their cars before but I also kind of</text>
  <text start="1840.24" dur="5.22">wanted to say to your earlier point</text>
  <text start="1842.46" dur="4.469">about sort of nutrition and such quality</text>
  <text start="1845.46" dur="4.14">you know you come up even things and</text>
  <text start="1846.929" dur="5.161">such being lard be healthy I like to</text>
  <text start="1849.6" dur="4.439">sort of sometimes trick children and say</text>
  <text start="1852.09" dur="3.99">which is better for you the pizza or the</text>
  <text start="1854.039" dur="4.051">Apple and of course they&amp;#39;ll say the</text>
  <text start="1856.08" dur="3.959">Apple but really it you know in my mind</text>
  <text start="1858.09" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s in it what was sprayed</text>
  <text start="1860.039" dur="2.671">on it you know where&amp;#39;s it from what what</text>
  <text start="1861.75" dur="2.279">what&amp;#39;s it made out of</text>
  <text start="1862.71" dur="3.209">you know what are the ingredients that</text>
  <text start="1864.029" dur="3.99">kind of thing because in in theory you</text>
  <text start="1865.919" dur="4.651">know you can have a raw pizza that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1868.019" dur="4.111">this healthy out of like all raw food</text>
  <text start="1870.57" dur="2.88">and vegetables and such and it could be</text>
  <text start="1872.13" dur="5.97">much better for you than a pesticide</text>
  <text start="1873.45" dur="6.449">ridden Apple so I would I would agree</text>
  <text start="1878.1" dur="3.59">with that as a matter of fact if so if</text>
  <text start="1879.899" dur="4.41">somebody made a pizza where the crust</text>
  <text start="1881.69" dur="3.82">was one of the cauliflower crusts</text>
  <text start="1884.309" dur="5.941">without a whole bunch of other garbage</text>
  <text start="1885.51" dur="10.32">added yeah and if if the cheese was raw</text>
  <text start="1890.25" dur="7.049">milk grass-fed grated cheese and if they</text>
  <text start="1895.83" dur="2.76">didn&amp;#39;t they wouldn&amp;#39;t even have to be</text>
  <text start="1897.299" dur="3.72">totally raw I mean they could they could</text>
  <text start="1898.59" dur="4.92">cook up some grass-fed beef and put some</text>
  <text start="1901.019" dur="4.171">hamburger meat on there and a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1903.51" dur="3.36">whatever good quality vegetables you</text>
  <text start="1905.19" dur="3.81">want I mean there would be a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="1906.87" dur="4.59">of ways to make things that some people</text>
  <text start="1909" dur="3.929">think are bad for you be less bad than</text>
  <text start="1911.46" dur="3.3">the thing that they think is good for</text>
  <text start="1912.929" dur="4.201">them because of course if it&amp;#39;s fruit</text>
  <text start="1914.76" dur="4.169">that&amp;#39;s loaded with sugar so you know is</text>
  <text start="1917.13" dur="3.179">that good or bad it depends on which one</text>
  <text start="1918.929" dur="4.681">it is whether it was sprayed and how</text>
  <text start="1920.309" dur="5.041">much you&amp;#39;re eating for sure and you just</text>
  <text start="1923.61" dur="2.58">made me really hungry that actually</text>
  <text start="1925.35" dur="4.559">sounded amazing</text>
  <text start="1926.19" dur="5.339">so here&amp;#39;s storyteller so you know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1929.909" dur="3.661">we&amp;#39;ve talked about some of those some of</text>
  <text start="1931.529" dur="4.14">the problems and such out there you know</text>
  <text start="1933.57" dur="3.78">some of your solutions with those top</text>
  <text start="1935.669" dur="4.14">seven that you mentioned I know I think</text>
  <text start="1937.35" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;ll braid some of that I I do a multi</text>

  <text start="1953.31" dur="4.47">for preventive maintenance you know an</text>
  <text start="1956.04" dur="4.89">ounce of prevention pound of kind of</text>
  <text start="1957.78" dur="5.43">thing for sure I&amp;#39;ve seen what happens if</text>
  <text start="1960.93" dur="4.26">you drink the soda is if you make the</text>
  <text start="1963.21" dur="5.33">wrong decisions if you put it off if you</text>
  <text start="1965.19" dur="9.26">you just say later later later you know</text>
  <text start="1968.54" dur="9.52">problems it&amp;#39;s so much easier to prevent</text>
  <text start="1974.45" dur="6.58">just about every condition than it is to</text>
  <text start="1978.06" dur="6.54">cure it afterwards and that that would</text>
  <text start="1981.03" dur="7.47">be cancer that would be multiple</text>
  <text start="1984.6" dur="5.4">sclerosis ALS Alzheimer&amp;#39;s I mean some of</text>
  <text start="1988.5" dur="5.16">these things you can have major inroads</text>
  <text start="1990" dur="6">in diabetes arthritis some of them you</text>
  <text start="1993.66" dur="4.05">can actually cure and you know you get</text>
  <text start="1996" dur="3.24">rid of the problems they go away I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1997.71" dur="3.06">had lots of people that when they came</text>
  <text start="1999.24" dur="4.74">in to me were diagnosed with type 2</text>
  <text start="2000.77" dur="5.46">diabetes and within very often under six</text>
  <text start="2003.98" dur="4.26">months worth of teaching them that they</text>
  <text start="2006.23" dur="3.66">need to be on a high-fat diet it just</text>
  <text start="2008.24" dur="3.33">needs to be good fats they need to eat</text>
  <text start="2009.89" dur="3.87">animal protein again it just has to be</text>
  <text start="2011.57" dur="4.29">grass-fed and good stuff they need to</text>
  <text start="2013.76" dur="3.75">put the yolk back in the egg and eat the</text>
  <text start="2015.86" dur="3.87">as many eggs as they want as long as</text>
  <text start="2017.51" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re pasture-raised and we get out</text>
  <text start="2019.73" dur="3.78">the starches to sugars in the alcohol</text>
  <text start="2021.74" dur="3.41">and all of a sudden their blood sugar</text>
  <text start="2023.51" dur="4.11">drops down to normal and they lose</text>
  <text start="2025.15" dur="5.23">they&amp;#39;re never never unhappy about this</text>
  <text start="2027.62" dur="5.91">they lose their diabetic diagnosis I and</text>
  <text start="2030.38" dur="5.1">the doctor pulls them all before</text>
  <text start="2033.53" dur="3.06">diabetes drugs and you know they were</text>
  <text start="2035.48" dur="2.19">told well you&amp;#39;re gonna happen for the</text>
  <text start="2036.59" dur="2.73">rest of your life and it&amp;#39;s gonna slowly</text>
  <text start="2037.67" dur="3.06">get worse and here I helped teach them</text>
  <text start="2039.32" dur="5.4">how to reverse it but the public doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2040.73" dur="5.91">know this stuff to make it worse the the</text>
  <text start="2044.72" dur="4.05">tests that are done to be able to look</text>
  <text start="2046.64" dur="5.039">at this so for diabetes the the most</text>
  <text start="2048.77" dur="6.03">accurate test is called hemoglobin a1c H</text>
  <text start="2051.679" dur="4.831">a1c and so the person goes into their</text>
  <text start="2054.8" dur="4.2">doctor they get a blood test done maybe</text>
  <text start="2056.51" dur="5.36">four maybe it&amp;#39;s their annual test or</text>
  <text start="2059" dur="6.14">whatever and the H a1c comes back at</text>
  <text start="2061.87" dur="6.4">let&amp;#39;s pick a number five point seven so</text>
  <text start="2065.14" dur="4.75">technically in US medicine five point</text>
  <text start="2068.27" dur="5.55">seven means that they are now classified</text>
  <text start="2069.89" dur="6.33">as pre-diabetic I have never and I do</text>
  <text start="2073.82" dur="4.68">mean never not a single time I have</text>

  <text start="2113.93" dur="7.17">worse you know I&amp;#39;ve got some friends in</text>
  <text start="2118.73" dur="5.61">the the sort of health truth movement</text>
  <text start="2121.1" dur="6.93">and I&amp;#39;ve heard talk of throwing together</text>
  <text start="2124.34" dur="6.63">sort of a an honest Medical Journal that</text>
  <text start="2128.03" dur="4.92">is against censorship and could be maybe</text>
  <text start="2130.97" dur="3.39">even head up headed up by you know some</text>

  <text start="2204.89" dur="5.1">network to bring to that</text>

  <text start="2236.21" dur="3.57">spell David everybody can has told</text>
  <text start="2237.92" dur="4.2">people to get off this or get off that</text>
  <text start="2239.78" dur="4.49">but for some reason David they can</text>
  <text start="2242.12" dur="7.68">understand and they can&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="2244.27" dur="9.22">anybody&amp;#39;s name would actually be g-e-t o</text>
  <text start="2249.8" dur="5.79">FF and so they misspelled get off and</text>
  <text start="2253.49" dur="3.69">they tell me that they tried that but it</text>
  <text start="2255.59" dur="4.35">didn&amp;#39;t work and I go how do you spell</text>

  <text start="2266.9" dur="4.47">name is just get off yeah</text>
  <text start="2268.97" dur="3.93">so David get off calm is the easiest way</text>
  <text start="2271.37" dur="3.39">to get there that&amp;#39;s perfect</text>
  <text start="2272.9" dur="5.19">it suits you very well for what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2274.76" dur="4.98">doing as well um so do we hit all of the</text>
  <text start="2278.09" dur="3.51">main points I know we covered a lot of</text>
  <text start="2279.74" dur="5.33">different material there people will</text>
  <text start="2281.6" dur="3.47">find a lot of value in this already</text>
  <text start="2287.41" dur="4.06">well something something that would be</text>
  <text start="2289.46" dur="3.12">worthwhile adding because some people</text>
  <text start="2291.47" dur="4.55">will be interested in it</text>
  <text start="2292.58" dur="5.91">I developed a course that I entitled</text>
  <text start="2296.02" dur="5.2">attaining optimal health of them in the</text>
  <text start="2298.49" dur="4.92">20th century and then they changed the</text>
  <text start="2301.22" dur="4.23">centuries on me and I had to change it</text>
  <text start="2303.41" dur="3.12">to attaining optimal health and 21st</text>
  <text start="2305.45" dur="4.23">century so I&amp;#39;ve been teaching it for</text>
  <text start="2306.53" dur="5.82">about 20 plus years and I&amp;#39;m videotaping</text>
  <text start="2309.68" dur="5.07">that course now and I want to make it so</text>
  <text start="2312.35" dur="4.53">that it won&amp;#39;t only be for people that</text>
  <text start="2314.75" dur="4.32">live in San Diego County and can come</text>
  <text start="2316.88" dur="4.77">for ten consecutive Tuesday evenings</text>
  <text start="2319.07" dur="4.95">from 6:30 to 9:30 so that course is</text>
  <text start="2321.65" dur="4.35">going to go up probably on video within</text>
  <text start="2324.02" dur="3.39">the next month or less on people would</text>
  <text start="2326" dur="5.73">be able to rent the rights to watch it</text>
  <text start="2327.41" dur="6.24">or buy it and what I&amp;#39;m doing is against</text>
  <text start="2331.73" dur="3.63">my better judgement because I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="2333.65" dur="3.96">people that want to capture your</text>
  <text start="2335.36" dur="5.04">information that just bothers me but I</text>
  <text start="2337.61" dur="4.95">finally I finally broke down and put a</text>
  <text start="2340.4" dur="4.11">subscription area on my website where</text>
  <text start="2342.56" dur="3.72">you can subscribe to the website you</text>
  <text start="2344.51" dur="2.07">will almost never hear from me you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2346.28" dur="1.71">not</text>
  <text start="2346.58" dur="3.45">to get a monthly anything you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2347.99" dur="3.39">gonna get a weekly anything but if</text>
  <text start="2350.03" dur="4.14">there&amp;#39;s something important like when I</text>
  <text start="2351.38" dur="4.23">get that up I will let everybody know so</text>
  <text start="2354.17" dur="3.18">if you want to know anything that I</text>

  <text start="2365.62" dur="3.97">anything I think is important comes up</text>
  <text start="2368" dur="3.03">and it&amp;#39;s up to you whether you want to</text>

  <text start="2378.05" dur="3.72">have to have emails these days just to</text>
  <text start="2379.88" dur="4.44">get around the censorship and such but I</text>

  <text start="2387.86" dur="4.89">for mine and some other offers i knowes</text>
  <text start="2389.78" dur="6.3">books just sort of a censorship proof</text>
  <text start="2392.75" dur="4.74">place for free speech maybe some folks</text>
  <text start="2396.08" dur="3.27">they just can&amp;#39;t get published or</text>
