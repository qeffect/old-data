  <text start="19.34" dur="2.07">me for one I can tell you and I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="20.42" dur="2.64">every post there&amp;#39;s never anything</text>
  <text start="21.41" dur="2.85">mentioned by Bill Hicks so you know</text>
  <text start="23.06" dur="1.95">somebody told you that that was in there</text>
  <text start="24.26" dur="2.49">they&amp;#39;ve been giving you false</text>
  <text start="25.01" dur="3.21">information trying to pin it on us so I</text>

  <text start="53.02" dur="3.21">leader and I think it&amp;#39;s built that way</text>

  <text start="56.23" dur="4.11">to grasp how we can bottle this how we</text>
  <text start="58.27" dur="3.929">can get this all who&amp;#39;s the spokesperson</text>

  <text start="67.3" dur="3.45">bunch of conversations for the president</text>
  <text start="68.77" dur="4.23">but our listeners got him elected so</text>
  <text start="70.75" dur="4.229">this is tail wagging the dog we were</text>
  <text start="73" dur="4.229">real people like Mohammed I&amp;#39;m an</text>
  <text start="74.979" dur="4.621">American patriot all I&amp;#39;m saying is is</text>

  <text start="84.009" dur="4.411">when I just hear people saying that this</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="5.49">Holiness has said that I&amp;#39;m bad I want to</text>
  <text start="88.42" dur="5.25">just find out what who the holiness is</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="5.31">Alex there&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been a year and happen</text>
  <text start="93.67" dur="2.6">I think what</text>
  <text start="97.7" dur="4.51">now to be like I&amp;#39;m kind of like playing</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="2.43">around with transitions here and</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="4.17">learning what I&amp;#39;m doing to apologize</text>
  <text start="103.5" dur="6.6">about how slow I am about it but to be</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="5.7">fair about this whole accusation thing Q</text>
  <text start="110.1" dur="3.63">has linked Alex Jones to Mossad now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="112.08" dur="5.1">also denounced him a few different times</text>
  <text start="113.73" dur="7.35">in a negative light to be completely and</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="5.73">utterly transparent here I defended Alex</text>
  <text start="121.08" dur="3.33">Jones McEwan on the first couple times</text>
  <text start="122.91" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s on the record that&amp;#39;s still in my</text>
  <text start="124.41" dur="4.41">video somewhere lost of history right</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="3.69">but I actually defended Alex Jones I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="128.82" dur="4.59">actually been defending Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="130.26" dur="5.49">through debate for like 15 years now all</text>
  <text start="133.41" dur="4.35">right the Bill Hicks stuff you know when</text>
  <text start="135.75" dur="4.74">when even when Hugh mentioned the court</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="5.4">case like where they had tried to make</text>
  <text start="140.49" dur="5.07">it out like he was the satire or or this</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="4.74">crisis factor or before on a crisis</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="4.05">actor performance artist was what they</text>
  <text start="147.9" dur="4.559">had tried to do in the MSM pain in him</text>
  <text start="149.61" dur="4.95">as a sort of an actor or a fake look you</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="3.601">can dress up and act stupid and kind of</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="4.2">get your point across with humour like</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="4.71">1% of the time I get that right that</text>
  <text start="158.76" dur="4.8">makes sense I defended him even from Q</text>
  <text start="160.77" dur="5.07">on that but that&amp;#39;s not all that goes</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="4.04">into this story there&amp;#39;s a lot of context</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="4.53">here and Q has called him out repeatedly</text>
  <text start="167.6" dur="5.41">so throughout the movement of queuing on</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="5.07">I&amp;#39;ve actually transitioned from one of</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="4.5">Alex Jones his most loyal fans with the</text>
  <text start="175.44" dur="4.2">big berkey with a big stack of stickers</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="3.57">everywhere I&amp;#39;ve convinced one of my</text>
  <text start="179.64" dur="3.75">grandmother&amp;#39;s to put that darn sticker</text>
  <text start="181.08" dur="4.35">on her bumper and I snuck the other one</text>
  <text start="183.39" dur="4.02">on the other grandmother&amp;#39;s bumper okay I</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="3.66">got those bumper stickers out there I</text>
  <text start="187.41" dur="3.299">might have even accidentally left a few</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="4.619">of them on some Walmart shopping carts</text>
  <text start="190.709" dur="5.461">my friends I was a Q or I&amp;#39;m sorry I was</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="4.681">an info war fanatic I was an equal</text>
  <text start="196.17" dur="4.86">warrior but I don&amp;#39;t always trust Alex</text>
  <text start="198.39" dur="5.04">Jones now if he is making like</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="4.53">legitimate suit for peace here I hope</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s the case I really hope that like</text>
  <text start="205.56" dur="4.74">he was wrong about him and Hugh body I</text>
  <text start="208.05" dur="5.55">could use some clarification on this</text>
  <text start="210.3" dur="6.54">issue but I have to go based off of what</text>
  <text start="213.6" dur="5.76">Hugh has told us to do and the last</text>
  <text start="216.84" dur="5.19">information I got from Q on this topic</text>
  <text start="219.36" dur="5.41">was fake mega bad</text>
  <text start="222.03" dur="7.18">Alex Jones and Pacific and others</text>
  <text start="224.77" dur="6.03">controlled opposition and and I know</text>
  <text start="229.21" dur="3.87">that they have not treated me very well</text>
  <text start="230.8" dur="4.29">personally at all remember when I tried</text>
  <text start="233.08" dur="4.32">to debate friendly with the so big back</text>
  <text start="235.09" dur="4.65">when I were still respecting him he</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="4.32">talks to me when I tried to go to speak</text>
  <text start="239.74" dur="4.32">on the topic of queueing on at American</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="5.49">priority conference I already showed I</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="7.77">proved this he actually had me D</text>
  <text start="247.21" dur="6.36">platformed okay and then they in May</text>
  <text start="251.83" dur="3.12">they admitted this to on their own their</text>
  <text start="253.57" dur="2.699">tweet Twitter so they actually said</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="4.02">after speaking with decided well of law</text>
  <text start="256.269" dur="4.56">we decided not to do that breakout so</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="3.63">this is like an ongoing thing and</text>
  <text start="260.829" dur="3.421">they&amp;#39;re not allowed to talk to me those</text>
  <text start="262.6" dur="3.24">people that have a social circle they</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="3.99">treat me like a leper</text>
  <text start="265.84" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a defective don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="268.24" dur="5.16">speak to Dustin Nemo&amp;#39;s ban from the Alex</text>
  <text start="270.46" dur="4.5">Jones crew now there&amp;#39;s also some overlap</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="4.32">and Kowal it like with the Magra</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="4.65">coalition the anti Q people so Alex</text>
  <text start="277.72" dur="4.11">buddy if you&amp;#39;re serious about this like</text>
  <text start="279.61" dur="4.71">friendship thing we got to talk about</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="5.82">who you associate with and we got to get</text>
  <text start="284.32" dur="4.68">you some better friends now I&amp;#39;m game if</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="4.11">we could find a way to bring knowledge</text>
  <text start="289" dur="5.669">drones back into the cause back to cue</text>
  <text start="291.76" dur="5.19">and get him some forgiveness I would</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="3.931">fight for that I don&amp;#39;t speak for cue I</text>
  <text start="296.95" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t speak for the whole movement right</text>
  <text start="298.6" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;m just one voice at that table I have</text>
  <text start="301.06" dur="2.97">some respect because I&amp;#39;ve been around</text>
  <text start="302.35" dur="4.2">for a long time and I&amp;#39;ve never wavered</text>
  <text start="304.03" dur="3.51">on Q I come at this from the logic</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="3.69">reason evidence</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="4.26">and compassion perspective I have great</text>
  <text start="310.24" dur="3.6">respect for Alex Jones for what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="4.5">done in the past my contingent czar that</text>
  <text start="313.84" dur="4.079">he&amp;#39;s controlled opposition and that most</text>
  <text start="316.3" dur="4.29">of what he says is actually good</text>
  <text start="317.919" dur="4.231">information that he may be a limited</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="4.11">hang out and I&amp;#39;m thinking that spaced</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="6.18">off of the evidence available what Q was</text>
  <text start="324.7" dur="5.91">talked about now later in this video he</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="4.14">threatens my life all right so this is</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="3.96">at least that&amp;#39;s what it sounds like very</text>
  <text start="332.47" dur="3.6">much to me he&amp;#39;s describing meand once</text>
  <text start="334.57" dur="4.56">again he doesn&amp;#39;t mention me by name but</text>
  <text start="336.07" dur="5.34">he&amp;#39;s describing me he&amp;#39;s quoting me again</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="3">we know who you&amp;#39;re talking about Alex I</text>
  <text start="341.41" dur="3.03">know that you</text>
  <text start="342.13" dur="4.2">hide the clip on all of the uploaded</text>
  <text start="344.44" dur="4.23">versions but of course you&amp;#39;re Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="4.53">man we got the live version that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="348.67" dur="3.6">too so we actually got you even though</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="4.98">you tried to hide it which is even worse</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="5.16">so look I&amp;#39;m okay with friendship I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="355.84" dur="3.48">located with negotiation and discussion</text>
  <text start="357.43" dur="3.51">but don&amp;#39;t ever threaten me I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="359.32" dur="3">afraid of you and I got so much dirt on</text>
  <text start="360.94" dur="3.72">you I can bury you brother</text>
  <text start="362.32" dur="4.05">and that&amp;#39;s out there now so I got</text>
  <text start="364.66" dur="4.38">Deadman switch is set up because of the</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="5.37">threat that you made now beyond that I</text>
  <text start="369.04" dur="5.04">also have Hugh haven&amp;#39;t told anons that</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="5.07">Menon&amp;#39;s are safe so if I were to die</text>
  <text start="374.08" dur="6.03">Hugh back me up here it would look bad</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="6.33">right so anyway hopefully that&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="380.11" dur="6.38">enough right anyway let&amp;#39;s continue on</text>
  <text start="383.14" dur="3.35">with what he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="389.45" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;ve been a while back if we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="391.7" dur="4.2">about late April or May I mean I mean I</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="6.75">knew Jerry Corsi before before cue I</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="6.62">come from the JFK movement that I think</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="2.21">Jerry</text>
  <text start="403.73" dur="5.16">and for for Kant</text>
  <text start="405.98" dur="6.72">I actually remember how to interview</text>
  <text start="408.89" dur="5.79">Jerry Corsi twice very Anatoly we had a</text>
  <text start="412.7" dur="3.33">great time he said I was like his</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="4.77">favorite interviewer in the queue</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="5.49">movement but that was before he started</text>
  <text start="419.45" dur="3.99">to do some of the misinformation that he</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="3.3">shared that changed or edited cue proof</text>
  <text start="423.44" dur="3.87">which may or may not have been his fault</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="4.38">and that was about at the same time the</text>
  <text start="427.31" dur="3.66">underwear bomber was supposed to be in</text>
  <text start="429.2" dur="4.05">Texas trying to kill Alex Jones right so</text>
  <text start="430.97" dur="3.66">it was really getting strange it almost</text>
  <text start="433.25" dur="4.74">seemed like there was already a movement</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="5.73">to try to link violence to queueing on</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="4.77">as though Alex Jones and Corsi were in</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="4.32">on it and we noticed so that creates</text>
  <text start="442.76" dur="5.28">false evidence that got him in his own</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="5.07">words admitting that he docks man well</text>
  <text start="448.04" dur="3.15">it admitting that he&amp;#39;s a liar I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="3.78">gotten him saying he never talks as</text>
  <text start="451.19" dur="3.96">anyone dancing me and then a couple of</text>
  <text start="453.53" dur="4.23">weeks later all of this within a span of</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="5.1">like a month saying he never doxxed</text>
  <text start="457.76" dur="4.38">anyone in his own words I prove the man</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="4.89">a liar okay we already know he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="462.14" dur="4.86">plagiarist as well so and and other</text>
  <text start="465.14" dur="4.05">potential questionable things going on</text>
  <text start="467" dur="4.89">with Pacific so he didn&amp;#39;t treat me very</text>
  <text start="469.19" dur="5.16">well in person it actually shocked some</text>
  <text start="471.89" dur="4.59">of the people that we were with that I</text>
  <text start="474.35" dur="4.14">was with with at dinner at American</text>
  <text start="476.48" dur="4.38">priority because Pacific actually</text>
  <text start="478.49" dur="3.54">treated me very badly and they were sort</text>
  <text start="480.86" dur="4.2">of surprised they didn&amp;#39;t think that he</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="4.89">was like that okay so you know when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="485.06" dur="4.02">not macking on the honey&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.92" dur="3.99">basically like attacking cue and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.08" dur="4.47">something I noticed with sobic he</text>
  <text start="490.91" dur="5.25">activated the same day MSN did as far as</text>
  <text start="493.55" dur="4.95">like going from ignore to attack on cue</text>
  <text start="496.16" dur="4.62">I spot these things Alex not all of them</text>
  <text start="498.5" dur="3.9">that I spot a lot of them buddy anyway</text>
  <text start="500.78" dur="4.59">let&amp;#39;s get back to what you&amp;#39;re saying I</text>
  <text start="502.4" dur="6.65">want to be open about this this will</text>

  <text start="514.289" dur="5.431">view and again as you know I mean he did</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="4.11">a 180 so again I&amp;#39;m not trying to talk</text>
  <text start="519.72" dur="3.21">out of school or talk bad about anybody</text>

  <text start="522.93" dur="3.57">know I hear you and course he still owe</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="2.55">money and I&amp;#39;m not gonna get into it for</text>

  <text start="704.07" dur="3.92">my man at the wrong tone you see</text>
  <text start="710.03" dur="3.87">well me I think some of the interesting</text>
  <text start="711.65" dur="4.5">things that maybe he can answer is I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="713.9" dur="3.99">been a cue skeptic from day one and</text>
  <text start="716.15" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s a wide range of reasons for that</text>
  <text start="717.89" dur="3.06">I respect the people who want to do</text>
  <text start="719.36" dur="3.27">their own independent inquiry and want</text>
  <text start="720.95" dur="3">to come to their own conclusions I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="722.63" dur="4.53">skeptical of anything that was</text>
  <text start="723.95" dur="3.93">suggesting that either Trump had more</text>
  <text start="727.16" dur="2.94">controlled and</text>
  <text start="727.88" dur="3.9">they didn&amp;#39;t recognize the degree of</text>
  <text start="730.1" dur="3.72">threat that the president faced we do</text>
  <text start="731.78" dur="4.94">Harold exactly we do have a real dual</text>
  <text start="733.82" dur="2.9">state in the country</text>
  <text start="737.11" dur="5.469">well according to the cue movement Trump</text>
  <text start="740.269" dur="5.01">has nearly been assassinated a number of</text>
  <text start="742.579" dur="4.831">times I&amp;#39;ve done videos on this so I</text>
  <text start="745.279" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t know about us under estimating</text>
  <text start="747.41" dur="3.6">anything I think we take this far more</text>
  <text start="749.209" dur="4.851">seriously than your average like Maggie</text>
  <text start="751.01" dur="5.639">a patriot and nothing against them but</text>
  <text start="754.06" dur="4.87">you know a lot of the cute people are</text>
  <text start="756.649" dur="3.391">the people like me a lot of time on</text>
  <text start="758.93" dur="3.27">their hands and the internet and they</text>
  <text start="760.04" dur="4.169">are sort of obsessive about it and we</text>
  <text start="762.2" dur="3.93">like to dig and we like to do some of</text>
  <text start="764.209" dur="3.511">these deep dives that&amp;#39;s why a lot of us</text>
  <text start="766.13" dur="4.079">have earned the nickname of the autistic</text>
  <text start="767.72" dur="5.4">army because we&amp;#39;re sort of obsessed with</text>
  <text start="770.209" dur="5.94">the truth and with justice because we</text>
  <text start="773.12" dur="6.06">see how bad it is out there we see how</text>
  <text start="776.149" dur="4.831">evil things that are and we see the</text>

  <text start="784.79" dur="4.89">the hive brain of the world and there</text>
  <text start="787.7" dur="4.98">are millions of us out there together we</text>
  <text start="789.68" dur="5.159">can do anything so people like Alex</text>
  <text start="792.68" dur="4.589">Jones this sort of liking me ii is a</text>
  <text start="794.839" dur="5.611">gatekeeper of the past but now this is a</text>
  <text start="797.269" dur="4.951">new era a trump era an era of change and</text>
  <text start="800.45" dur="7.829">now that is some very threatening for</text>
  <text start="802.22" dur="7.44">all gatekeepers of the past so listen</text>
  <text start="808.279" dur="2.881">folks you don&amp;#39;t get to Alex Jones his</text>
  <text start="809.66" dur="4.799">level of power without getting the</text>
  <text start="811.16" dur="8.25">ability to change the world and he</text>
  <text start="814.459" dur="9">didn&amp;#39;t so with all due respect Alex and</text>
  <text start="819.41" dur="9.03">with all due scepticism up Alex I do</text>
  <text start="823.459" dur="7.081">think that Hugh is the better and more</text>
  <text start="828.44" dur="5.28">reliable force between the two and has</text>
  <text start="830.54" dur="6.03">the the better fruit of the tree which</text>
  <text start="833.72" dur="4.859">of course Alex has quoted me on in a</text>
  <text start="836.57" dur="3.329">mocking manner so again you know</text>
  <text start="838.579" dur="2.851">condescension</text>
  <text start="839.899" dur="3.891">it&amp;#39;s not good you&amp;#39;re very you&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="841.43" dur="4.83">bright you&amp;#39;re smarter than I am by far</text>
  <text start="843.79" dur="5.56">but condescension is not a good way to</text>
  <text start="846.26" dur="7.28">approach people you know try another way</text>
  <text start="849.35" dur="4.19">if you&amp;#39;re serious I hope you are</text>
  <text start="854.25" dur="4.05">the president does not control and that</text>
  <text start="856.29" dur="4.02">is a constant continuous threat to the</text>
  <text start="858.3" dur="4.979">president I was particularly critical</text>
  <text start="860.31" dur="4.86">when aspects of the queue crowd was</text>
  <text start="863.279" dur="4.021">suggesting that either sessions or Huber</text>
  <text start="865.17" dur="3.63">were in control when my view was they</text>
  <text start="867.3" dur="4.079">were not based on my experience in the</text>
  <text start="868.8" dur="4.139">criminal defense field and now of course</text>
  <text start="871.379" dur="2.58">turned out we wouldn&amp;#39;t bar wouldn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="872.939" dur="2.82">to be there and wouldn&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="873.959" dur="3.87">stepping in and hiring other people if</text>
  <text start="875.759" dur="4.411">Huber had been doing anything over the</text>
  <text start="877.829" dur="4.26">last two years of consequence but I</text>
  <text start="880.17" dur="4.109">respect the sincerity of the people that</text>
  <text start="882.089" dur="4.411">are involved in the queue concerns my</text>
  <text start="884.279" dur="4.74">concern was that that some of that was</text>
  <text start="886.5" dur="3.899">being misled and misdirected to believe</text>
  <text start="889.019" dur="3.601">things were safer than they really were</text>
  <text start="890.399" dur="4.29">to believe that Julian Assange was in a</text>
  <text start="892.62" dur="3.719">better position that he really was there</text>
  <text start="894.689" dur="4.411">was part of the queue movement that</text>
  <text start="896.339" dur="5.971">thought that doing the song oh yeah our</text>
  <text start="899.1" dur="4.799">story from core see that that he was</text>
  <text start="902.31" dur="3.24">going to be flown out to Switzerland and</text>
  <text start="903.899" dur="4.29">I tried to call court see of course he</text>
  <text start="905.55" dur="5.13">says queue says and I said man stop</text>
  <text start="908.189" dur="4.83">going with what Q says correct and I</text>
  <text start="910.68" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t want to feed Drudge BS I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="913.019" dur="3.151">done that in my life</text>
  <text start="913.86" dur="4.469">precisely and and the other important</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="3.51">part is I think in dealing with people</text>
  <text start="918.329" dur="2.401">in the tax protest movement other</text>
  <text start="919.68" dur="3.57">movements have dealt with people that</text>
  <text start="920.73" dur="5.07">they when you come back I had so much</text>
  <text start="923.25" dur="6.089">credibility then does that never screwed</text>
  <text start="925.8" dur="4.83">reg over that I think dreads probably</text>
  <text start="929.339" dur="4.05">halfway he looks at me a little a sconce</text>
  <text start="930.63" dur="4.649">now rightfully so because he linked of</text>
  <text start="933.389" dur="3.841">course he&amp;#39;s saying that Assange is being</text>
  <text start="935.279" dur="4.43">flown next week to Switzerland it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="937.23" dur="2.479">true</text>
  <text start="939.89" dur="4.259">what we have at instances where queue</text>
  <text start="942.23" dur="4.5">has been wrong and we&amp;#39;ve had instances</text>
  <text start="944.149" dur="4.5">where Q has had to faint the enemy just</text>
  <text start="946.73" dur="6.51">like an art of war which we know drama</text>
  <text start="948.649" dur="8.19">practices to read his books now as far</text>
  <text start="953.24" dur="5.46">as you know no one&amp;#39;s perfect and can</text>
  <text start="956.839" dur="3.571">predict the future 100% either we are</text>

  <text start="969.62" dur="4.89">man I look at you a sconce now because</text>
  <text start="971.779" dur="4.261">you lied about me and you you defamed my</text>
  <text start="974.51" dur="4.41">character you called me a bunch of</text>
  <text start="976.04" dur="5.789">stupid names like sayings ankle do you</text>
  <text start="978.92" dur="4.289">even remember that you said that I put</text>
  <text start="981.829" dur="4.141">out a video to kill you and how you</text>
  <text start="983.209" dur="4.56">threatened to kill me it looks like you</text>
  <text start="985.97" dur="3.09">said a bunch of things about me that</text>
  <text start="987.769" dur="3.63">weren&amp;#39;t true you made fun of my</text>
  <text start="989.06" dur="4.88">positions you that you you treated me</text>
  <text start="991.399" dur="6.18">with the full MSM treatment ridicule</text>
  <text start="993.94" dur="5.38">strong Manning or everything now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="997.579" dur="3.391">okay I&amp;#39;m pretty Zen about things like</text>
  <text start="999.32" dur="3.6">that actually considered it a sign of</text>
  <text start="1000.97" dur="5.309">fear that you would even attack someone</text>
  <text start="1002.92" dur="5.31">as small as me so apparently I&amp;#39;m over</text>
  <text start="1006.279" dur="4.441">some targets now I think I have an idea</text>
  <text start="1008.23" dur="5.88">of what your targets are but you want to</text>
  <text start="1010.72" dur="5.309">talk well come on back to cue and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1014.11" dur="3.81">see what we can do I can&amp;#39;t speak for the</text>
  <text start="1016.029" dur="4.341">movement but like I said I have a voice</text>
  <text start="1017.92" dur="2.45">at the table</text>
  <text start="1023.05" dur="12.21">it wasn&amp;#39;t real and it burned my ass he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1034.059" dur="2.52">one of the leading most respected</text>
  <text start="1035.26" dur="4.079">experts on I think it&amp;#39;s a fascinating</text>
  <text start="1036.579" dur="4.021">phenomenon you talk about for days so I</text>
  <text start="1039.339" dur="1.771">appreciate him coming on he&amp;#39;s a nice</text>
  <text start="1040.6" dur="3.599">fella</text>
  <text start="1041.11" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s great eight seven seven seven</text>

  <text start="1045.73" dur="2.359">eight nine</text>
  <text start="1049.85" dur="7.56">to be completely fair here Alex has</text>
  <text start="1055.79" dur="3.06">never reached out to me and remember</text>
  <text start="1057.41" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s this two-factor don&amp;#39;t talk to</text>
  <text start="1058.85" dur="6.2">out to me most thing out there and maybe</text>
  <text start="1061.22" dur="7.53">this is his attempt to have sort of a</text>
  <text start="1065.05" dur="7.18">sort of a outreach and parlay which in</text>
  <text start="1068.75" dur="5.19">which case great but he also this was an</text>
  <text start="1072.23" dur="3.24">ambush this was a setup to make you look</text>
  <text start="1073.94" dur="3.63">stupid I mean really that&amp;#39;s what it was</text>
  <text start="1075.47" dur="5.49">this was basically like CNN indoors and</text>
  <text start="1077.57" dur="4.77">seder order a Comedy Central and Jordan</text>
  <text start="1080.96" dur="4.41">say there that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what this was</text>
  <text start="1082.34" dur="4.83">now really did fairly well I think he</text>
  <text start="1085.37" dur="5.4">stood out really well to the onslaught</text>
  <text start="1087.17" dur="5.28">but I also don&amp;#39;t think that Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="1090.77" dur="3.36">was genuinely looking for a leader</text>
  <text start="1092.45" dur="3.45">within the Q movement because there are</text>
  <text start="1094.13" dur="4.5">many channels out there that have</text>
