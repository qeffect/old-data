  <text start="28.92" dur="4.83">let me explain how this debunk is not</text>
  <text start="31.5" dur="4.11">actually a debunk because I guess it</text>
  <text start="33.75" dur="3.18">could look bad for people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="3.719">understand or have never met the</text>
  <text start="36.93" dur="3.66">Internet or people who just don&amp;#39;t you</text>

  <text start="57.78" dur="3.18">down now unfortunately and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="3.691">really trying to stop this from getting</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="5.4">out there so make sure that you have an</text>
  <text start="63.27" dur="4.74">archive set up but these websites you</text>
  <text start="66.36" dur="3.54">know they will have sort of a back end</text>
  <text start="68.01" dur="3">where all the files are collected</text>
  <text start="69.9" dur="4.2">together and all the data is collected</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="5.249">together now that is what some people</text>

  <text start="79.95" dur="3.87">the back end of a fan site really</text>
  <text start="81.63" dur="4.05">because these these websites you know</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="3.42">these archive sites like at the end of</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="2.49">the day they&amp;#39;re like a fan club site you</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="3.36">know this is something that the</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="4.07">community has done voluntarily at their</text>

  <text start="581.18" dur="3.12">know those Sedition laws that came out</text>
  <text start="582.71" dur="4.26">that wiped out the anarchist party which</text>
  <text start="584.3" dur="4.35">was a legitimate political group and the</text>
  <text start="586.97" dur="3.69">most moral of all of the groups out</text>
  <text start="588.65" dur="3.33">there as far as like politics goes and</text>

  <text start="602.69" dur="4.41">literally means rule without rulers it</text>
  <text start="605.48" dur="3.57">means no one has power over anyone else</text>
  <text start="607.1" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s I mean I am technically an</text>
  <text start="609.05" dur="4.92">anarchist I use the word voluntary</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="5.19">I we have changed the word now because</text>
  <text start="613.97" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;ve taken anarchist over and that is</text>
  <text start="616.76" dur="5.55">what sophistry is sophistry is this</text>
  <text start="619.61" dur="4.56">great deception that clouds the air of</text>
  <text start="622.31" dur="3.48">truth so that no one can know the truth</text>
  <text start="624.17" dur="4.23">anymore and I</text>
  <text start="625.79" dur="4.83">I loathe sophistry and I loathe the</text>
  <text start="628.4" dur="5.43">people that use these these these games</text>
  <text start="630.62" dur="5.04">to manipulate and deceive and I I do</text>
  <text start="633.83" dur="3.27">expose this kind of thing and people</text>
  <text start="635.66" dur="2.79">have asked me why do you want it to bait</text>
  <text start="637.1" dur="2.67">people like why you just like why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="638.45" dur="3.54">you just focus on the news and why are</text>
  <text start="639.77" dur="4.29">you um why are you so into debating and</text>
  <text start="641.99" dur="3.27">everything else like I guess it&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="644.06" dur="3.6">people don&amp;#39;t like conflict and I</text>
  <text start="645.26" dur="4.23">understand that but we are at war you do</text>
  <text start="647.66" dur="2.28">not win this war without conflict and</text>
  <text start="649.49" dur="2.22">cue</text>
  <text start="649.94" dur="3.54">basically the entire queue and on thing</text>
  <text start="651.71" dur="3.75">was about exposing the fake news I mean</text>
  <text start="653.48" dur="3.63">Trump&amp;#39;s got the rest of it we have to</text>
  <text start="655.46" dur="3.24">just expose the fake news okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="657.11" dur="5.49">what we have to do that&amp;#39;s our part of</text>
  <text start="658.7" dur="6.72">this and to that end the fake news</text>
  <text start="662.6" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;ve been exposed now we&amp;#39;re moving on</text>
  <text start="665.42" dur="3.51">to the alt media fakes</text>
  <text start="667.01" dur="4.26">okay we&amp;#39;re purifying our movement we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="668.93" dur="3.57">getting them out all right after this</text>
  <text start="671.27" dur="2.79">we&amp;#39;re gonna be the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="672.5" dur="3.33">after this they&amp;#39;re not going to be able</text>
  <text start="674.06" dur="4.11">to keep playing these sort of games and</text>
  <text start="675.83" dur="5.1">using people like Alex Jones to distract</text>
  <text start="678.17" dur="5.85">from the truth which is cueing on okay</text>
  <text start="680.93" dur="5.37">that I think you know it&amp;#39;s my theory in</text>
  <text start="684.02" dur="4.68">Jordan agrees with me</text>
  <text start="686.3" dur="4.05">that this whole banning info were saying</text>
  <text start="688.7" dur="3.99">was just a big distraction from cue and</text>
  <text start="690.35" dur="3.81">on right before the midterms they only</text>
  <text start="692.69" dur="3.45">need a little bit more time to try to</text>
  <text start="694.16" dur="5.3">impeach Trump that&amp;#39;s all they have it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="696.14" dur="6.33">their only hope so if that doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="699.46" dur="5.35">then having having an you know banj</text>
  <text start="702.47" dur="4.71">Infowars won&amp;#39;t matter anymore because</text>
  <text start="704.81" dur="3">they will have a lot bigger problems to</text>
  <text start="707.18" dur="4.71">deal with</text>
  <text start="707.81" dur="5.64">so we&amp;#39;ll see right we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="711.89" dur="3.57">happens with Infowars like I still I</text>
  <text start="713.45" dur="3.84">have great love in my heart for for Alex</text>
  <text start="715.46" dur="3.54">Jones like he was basically like my dad</text>
  <text start="717.29" dur="3.6">growing up cuz I wasn&amp;#39;t really that</text>
  <text start="719" dur="3.63">close to my family I didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="720.89" dur="3.21">anything in common with my family I was</text>
  <text start="722.63" dur="3.12">an Internet kid I&amp;#39;ve been plugged into</text>
  <text start="724.1" dur="4.56">the Internet like like neo in the matrix</text>
  <text start="725.75" dur="4.53">since forever and that&amp;#39;s how I came</text>
  <text start="728.66" dur="2.91">across all these rabbit holes okay and</text>
  <text start="730.28" dur="2.85">that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m able to bring you guys</text>
  <text start="731.57" dur="3.66">the things I&amp;#39;m able to bring you and</text>
  <text start="733.13" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s why some country nobody like me</text>
  <text start="735.23" dur="4.41">is able to talk about these advanced</text>
  <text start="736.91" dur="4.53">issues fairly comfortably I guess</text>
  <text start="739.64" dur="3.27">because I just learn learn learn all day</text>
  <text start="741.44" dur="6.84">long and I&amp;#39;m just basically downloading</text>
  <text start="742.91" dur="7.14">okay in my head so to that extent I hope</text>
  <text start="748.28" dur="3.48">Alex comes back I&amp;#39;m gonna interview</text>
  <text start="750.05" dur="3.33">Corsi in a few days and whenever he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="751.76" dur="3.27">ready and we&amp;#39;re gonna see you know what</text>
  <text start="753.38" dur="3.93">what is your position now you seem to be</text>
  <text start="755.03" dur="4.89">coming back to cube what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="757.31" dur="5.19">maybe if Alex Jones hits Q really hard</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="4.5">right now that he&amp;#39;s censored I mean boom</text>
  <text start="762.5" dur="4.2">maybe that&amp;#39;s part of the plan right who</text>
  <text start="764.42" dur="2.85">knows whom even knows at this point I</text>
  <text start="766.7" dur="2.6">hope so</text>
  <text start="767.27" dur="4.77">I would like to see Alex have indicated</text>
  <text start="769.3" dur="6.76">but you know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t hold</text>
  <text start="772.04" dur="5.31">punches when it comes to Sophists or</text>
  <text start="776.06" dur="4.11">Sophists or however you pronounce at</text>
  <text start="777.35" dur="5.25">night when you read everything and you</text>
  <text start="780.17" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t actually conversate with people</text>
  <text start="782.6" dur="6.51">your pronunciations get screwed by the</text>
  <text start="784.37" dur="6.96">way it&amp;#39;s office tree but here&amp;#39;s my thing</text>
  <text start="789.11" dur="5.67">all right that to me it seems like this</text>
  <text start="791.33" dur="4.74">fake stuff is fairly evident but I have</text>
  <text start="794.78" dur="4.64">to remember I spent like two years</text>
  <text start="796.07" dur="6.5">debating philosophy for fun okay just</text>
  <text start="799.42" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;m weird I did it for fun and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="802.57" dur="2.97">why I have all these like memes and</text>
  <text start="804.04" dur="3.33">pictures just ready to go and I can I</text>
  <text start="805.54" dur="3.3">can actually rebut anything that any of</text>
  <text start="807.37" dur="3.09">the anti queue folks have said with four</text>
  <text start="808.84" dur="4.92">pictures in less than five seconds like</text>
  <text start="810.46" dur="4.8">anything that they say I haven&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="813.76" dur="3.81">had to go beyond those four pictures yet</text>
  <text start="815.26" dur="4.35">like literally they&amp;#39;re not much of a</text>
  <text start="817.57" dur="3.72">challenge in that sense like I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="819.61" dur="4.08">people debate me before and I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="821.29" dur="4.71">thousands of memes ready to go for</text>
  <text start="823.69" dur="4.02">different arguments because I had carpal</text>
  <text start="826" dur="2.97">tunnel really bad until I started taking</text>
  <text start="827.71" dur="3.15">like astaxanthin and getting an</text>
  <text start="828.97" dur="3.57">antioxidants I had bare terrible carpal</text>
  <text start="830.86" dur="3.87">tunnel so what was I gonna do I had to</text>
  <text start="832.54" dur="3.99">like save my wrists I even have a mean</text>
  <text start="834.73" dur="3.57">for people who attacked my memes and in</text>
  <text start="836.53" dur="3.42">fact memes are a legitimate form of</text>
  <text start="838.3" dur="4.71">warfare and in fact I can send you to</text>
  <text start="839.95" dur="4.14">military like thesis papers about this</text>
  <text start="843.01" dur="4.14">okay</text>
  <text start="844.09" dur="6.87">memes are yq-- and not a big part of why</text>
  <text start="847.15" dur="6.06">qa9 has taken over the Internet right</text>
  <text start="850.96" dur="3.81">like memes they&amp;#39;re powerful okay that</text>
  <text start="853.21" dur="4.32">you can speak a thousand words with a</text>
  <text start="854.77" dur="5.22">picture and I encourage other people to</text>
  <text start="857.53" dur="3.2">use these memes into you know in in a</text>
  <text start="859.99" dur="4.65">fun way</text>
  <text start="860.73" dur="5.77">ridicule deception okay and I don&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="864.64" dur="4.5">to be impolite never be impolite because</text>
  <text start="866.5" dur="4.32">then you lose and once upon a time they</text>
  <text start="869.14" dur="3.15">used to teach this in high school and</text>
  <text start="870.82" dur="3.84">stuff you know not in my generation but</text>
  <text start="872.29" dur="4.08">like back in the day they would teach</text>
  <text start="874.66" dur="3.42">you that if you if you call out insults</text>
  <text start="876.37" dur="4.2">and stuff in a debate you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="878.08" dur="4.23">immediately lost right but people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="880.57" dur="4.08">know these things anymore until we point</text>
  <text start="882.31" dur="4.56">them out okay so it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="884.65" dur="3.75">logical fallacies like an ad hominem or</text>
  <text start="886.87" dur="3.18">an appeal to ridicule or a straw man or</text>
  <text start="888.4" dur="5.4">moving the goal posts or a Kafka</text>
