  <text start="114.369" dur="6.21">what a virtual book tour is it started</text>
  <text start="116.289" dur="6.63">for me back in 2002 in Quarter Madera</text>
  <text start="120.579" dur="4.801">California which is about six and a half</text>
  <text start="122.919" dur="5.01">miles from where I&amp;#39;m sitting right now</text>
  <text start="125.38" dur="4.89">I&amp;#39;m in San Rafael California literally</text>
  <text start="127.929" dur="3.931">about seven miles away from Skywalker</text>
  <text start="130.27" dur="3.4">Ranch and that&amp;#39;s of course George</text>
  <text start="131.86" dur="3.43">Lucas&amp;#39;s Skywalker Ranch wherever</text>
  <text start="133.67" dur="5.16">getting started for Star Wars many years</text>
  <text start="135.29" dur="6.33">ago and what happened that evening in</text>
  <text start="138.83" dur="4.86">November 2002 is I was going into a</text>
  <text start="141.62" dur="3.81">parking lot and it was a bookstore there</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="3.659">an independent bookstore called book</text>
  <text start="145.43" dur="3.9">passage it&amp;#39;s still there in court Madera</text>
  <text start="147.349" dur="4.081">California just north of the Golden Gate</text>
  <text start="149.33" dur="4.739">Bridge if you know northern California I</text>
  <text start="151.43" dur="4.13">couldn&amp;#39;t find parking I was meeting a</text>
  <text start="154.069" dur="4.111">high school buddy of mine for dinner and</text>
  <text start="155.56" dur="4.27">there was a restaurant right across the</text>
  <text start="158.18" dur="3.72">walkway from the bookstore and I</text>
  <text start="159.83" dur="3.689">couldn&amp;#39;t find any parking kind of upset</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="4.23">me because I knew I&amp;#39;d be late I parked</text>
  <text start="163.519" dur="4.831">about half a mile away I ran to the</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="4.26">restaurant and I saw people with books</text>
  <text start="168.35" dur="3.51">underneath their hands and I asked hey</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="3.45">what&amp;#39;s going on I mean why is the</text>
  <text start="171.86" dur="4.409">parking lot full what what is that book</text>
  <text start="173.84" dur="5.76">and the book happened to be called</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="6.991">entitled joined at the heart now back</text>
  <text start="179.6" dur="5.13">then in 2002 that was Al and Tipper Gore</text>
  <text start="183.26" dur="3.21">they were married at the time</text>
  <text start="184.73" dur="4.819">Al Gore of course is a two-time vice</text>
  <text start="186.47" dur="7.32">president Bill Clinton was president and</text>
  <text start="189.549" dur="6.401">he was having a physical book signing at</text>
  <text start="193.79" dur="3.66">book passage now I&amp;#39;m sure you know what</text>
  <text start="195.95" dur="3.599">that is where you go to a bookstore and</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="3.599">the author signs books many times people</text>
  <text start="199.549" dur="3.181">don&amp;#39;t even buy the books at the</text>
  <text start="201.049" dur="4.261">bookstore they bring their own books and</text>
  <text start="202.73" dur="5.67">they have the author sign it well I had</text>
  <text start="205.31" dur="4.649">my dinner and I bid farewell to my good</text>
  <text start="208.4" dur="4.32">friend and then I went across the</text>
  <text start="209.959" dur="4.5">walkway I asked the person behind the</text>
  <text start="212.72" dur="3.45">counter how many books were sold because</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;d never seen so many people in one</text>
  <text start="216.17" dur="5.52">place at that particular bookstore and</text>
  <text start="218.299" dur="6.241">she told me that over 440 books were</text>
  <text start="221.69" dur="4.769">sold now this is monumental because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="4.259">good friends with Mark Victor Hansen and</text>
  <text start="226.459" dur="4.951">Jack Canfield they&amp;#39;re authors of Chicken</text>
  <text start="228.799" dur="4.981">Soup for the Soul that franchise has</text>
  <text start="231.41" dur="5.46">sold hundreds of millions of books</text>
  <text start="233.78" dur="6.209">hopefully a billion before they leave</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="4.89">Earth and as it turns out that was the</text>
  <text start="239.989" dur="6">single biggest book signing I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="241.76" dur="7.65">witnessed or heard about and then I</text>
  <text start="245.989" dur="8.37">thought to myself well if the Gore&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.41" dur="7.799">got paid against the initial signing you</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="4.921">know an author will sign a contract and</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="4.201">then they&amp;#39;ll get paid a certain amount</text>
  <text start="259.28" dur="5.36">from a traditional publisher generally</text>
  <text start="261.41" dur="5.88">in New York and they eat away at that</text>
  <text start="264.64" dur="4.36">but that that</text>
  <text start="267.29" dur="3.6">initial investment that the publisher</text>
  <text start="269" dur="4.17">makes by the number of books that are</text>
  <text start="270.89" dur="5.01">sold and so if they got $2 a book which</text>
  <text start="273.17" dur="5.16">is a pretty good deal for a $20 book</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="4.86">like 10% which is customary some make</text>
  <text start="278.33" dur="4.68">more some make less they made less than</text>
  <text start="280.76" dur="5.25">a thousand dollars at that book signing</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="4.98">and I thought this is not very efficient</text>
  <text start="286.01" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s not very effective I&amp;#39;m a marketer</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m founder marketing online.com there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.48" dur="4.23">got to be a better way now back then</text>
  <text start="292.31" dur="4.29">there was no Facebook Google wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.71" dur="4.52">have its initial public offering for</text>
  <text start="296.6" dur="5.37">another two years there was no Twitter</text>
  <text start="299.23" dur="4.69">there weren&amp;#39;t the social media platforms</text>
  <text start="301.97" dur="4.02">that you and I both know about today</text>
  <text start="303.92" dur="3.84">which is fascinating it&amp;#39;s less than</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="4.44">twenty years ago but there were</text>
  <text start="307.76" dur="4.44">teleseminars and a teleseminar is where</text>
  <text start="310.43" dur="4.44">you dial into a bridge line there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.2" dur="4.86">typically over a thousand things where</text>
  <text start="314.87" dur="4.8">people dial in and then the host can</text>
  <text start="317.06" dur="5.76">mute everyone out and you end up doing</text>
  <text start="319.67" dur="6.45">an interview with an offer with a book</text>
  <text start="322.82" dur="6.09">and the virtual book tour was birthed as</text>
  <text start="326.12" dur="5.76">a result of that and fast forward many</text>
  <text start="328.91" dur="5.13">years later over I stopped counting at a</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="4.47">hundred and eight internationally</text>
  <text start="334.04" dur="4.77">best-selling books where the virtual</text>
  <text start="336.35" dur="5.01">book tour week where we would promote</text>
  <text start="338.81" dur="4.71">the book we would sell on Amazon some</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="3.6">made New York Times bestseller list</text>
  <text start="343.52" dur="4.82">which is very difficult</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="5.58">USA Today bestseller also difficult and</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="5.05">what ended up happening Wall Street</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="5.64">Journal is another one Amazon of all of</text>
  <text start="353.39" dur="5.7">them are typically is the easiest one to</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="4.83">get and this particular virtual book</text>
  <text start="359.09" dur="4.56">tour this is the virtual book tour week</text>
  <text start="361.01" dur="7.74">for this book chewing on the Great</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="6.09">Awakening I&amp;#39;ve never had a book become a</text>
  <text start="368.75" dur="4.14">best-seller</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="6.66">like number one before the virtual book</text>
  <text start="372.89" dur="6.51">tour and I&amp;#39;ve interviewed hundreds of</text>
  <text start="376.4" dur="4.56">authors over the years and so as a part</text>
  <text start="379.4" dur="3.51">of what I do at marketing online.com</text>
  <text start="380.96" dur="3.93">this is a great way to get to know an</text>
  <text start="382.91" dur="4.2">author and then eventually consult with</text>
  <text start="384.89" dur="4.29">them so it&amp;#39;s kind of what we call the</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="4.2">marketing the front end to consulting</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="5.64">well that&amp;#39;s not what this is about this</text>
  <text start="391.31" dur="6.41">is just for me a fascination of how does</text>
  <text start="394.82" dur="5.939">a book get over seven hundred and fifty</text>
  <text start="397.72" dur="4.39">certified reviews on Amazon</text>
  <text start="400.759" dur="4.65">how does a book become a best-seller</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="4.919">before the virtual book tour and so</text>
  <text start="405.409" dur="4.051">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to talk about</text>
  <text start="407.029" dur="6.301">and this book doesn&amp;#39;t even have a byline</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="6.389">the byline is by and then the author so</text>

  <text start="510.889" dur="7.59">origin story what specific incident</text>
  <text start="513.31" dur="6.789">inspired publishing this book so for</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="3.72">this book you know we&amp;#39;ve been in the</text>
  <text start="520.099" dur="3.81">queue movement dealing with as an</text>
  <text start="522.199" dur="3.361">anti-corruption movement of course we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="523.909" dur="3.721">been dealing with pushback most of it</text>
  <text start="525.56" dur="4.29">censorship and there&amp;#39;s been D</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="4.41">monetization and D platforming and other</text>
  <text start="529.85" dur="4.35">games that they play as well but the</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="3.93">real inspiration for this book was</text>
  <text start="534.2" dur="4.5">to get the cue message out there off the</text>
  <text start="535.97" dur="4.77">internet and cues made post references</text>
  <text start="538.7" dur="3.54">to books in the past to get around the</text>
  <text start="540.74" dur="4.35">censorship and and really also</text>
  <text start="542.24" dur="5.19">personally for me it was to try to bring</text>
  <text start="545.09" dur="3.81">where we go when we go all the movement</text>
  <text start="547.43" dur="3.69">and show them their power working</text>
  <text start="548.9" dur="4.2">together you know together a number of</text>
  <text start="551.12" dur="4.23">us about a dozen authors in this book</text>
  <text start="553.1" dur="6.24">the Amazon even when they started to</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="6.6">tinker with the algorithm ok so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="559.34" dur="5.46">interesting to me is the byline where we</text>
  <text start="561.95" dur="4.89">go one we go all who are some of the</text>
  <text start="564.8" dur="3.69">citizen reporters who decided to</text>

  <text start="884.869" dur="3.69">on YouTube periscope or if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="886.399" dur="4.56">Facebook right now but what I do know is</text>
  <text start="888.559" dur="5.4">it was a best-seller runaway bestseller</text>
  <text start="890.959" dur="6.09">top of the food chain of all selling</text>
  <text start="893.959" dur="7.021">books on Amazon despite any controversy</text>
  <text start="897.049" dur="6.66">of that Amazon may be holding against</text>
  <text start="900.98" dur="5.31">the book as many of the collaborators</text>
  <text start="903.709" dur="5.31">have stated I have no idea if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="906.29" dur="4.019">true or false what I do know is the fact</text>
  <text start="909.019" dur="4.26">is it is a best-seller</text>
  <text start="910.309" dur="5.52">it has over 750 reviews which is very</text>
  <text start="913.279" dur="5.64">very difficult to get so why is it a</text>
  <text start="915.829" dur="5.76">best-seller before we even started so</text>
  <text start="918.919" dur="4.02">this kind of little context I guess and</text>
  <text start="921.589" dur="4.59">I don&amp;#39;t want to go to political either</text>
  <text start="922.939" dur="5.161">but there is a big demand for other than</text>
  <text start="926.179" dur="3.181">big media you know people call them fake</text>
  <text start="928.1" dur="3.149">news and whether you agree with it or</text>
  <text start="929.36" dur="4.139">not there there&amp;#39;s a demand for new</text>
  <text start="931.249" dur="3.991">voices and new sources of information so</text>
  <text start="933.499" dur="3.631">I kind of fall into that category</text>
  <text start="935.24" dur="3.93">and most of the people in this book if</text>
  <text start="937.13" dur="4.709">not all fell into that category we all</text>
  <text start="939.17" dur="4.68">have a fairly large extensive audience</text>
  <text start="941.839" dur="3.87">some bigger than others that want to</text>
  <text start="943.85" dur="4.799">find the news from us and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="945.709" dur="4.741">necessarily trust media anymore so those</text>
  <text start="948.649" dur="3.451">people you know that this large audience</text>
  <text start="950.45" dur="3.09">of ours it was baked into the book I</text>
  <text start="952.1" dur="3.6">mean we we just told the people that</text>
  <text start="953.54" dur="4.98">already knew about us and then it went</text>
  <text start="955.7" dur="4.92">out and overnight almost bestseller and</text>
  <text start="958.52" dur="4.62">you know beat Stephen King and it it</text>
  <text start="960.62" dur="4.38">beat the the Andy McCabe deep state book</text>
  <text start="963.14" dur="3.93">at the time and and yeah as you said</text>
  <text start="965" dur="4.17">they did actually drop off a few hundred</text>
  <text start="967.07" dur="3.99">of our certified reviews but you know</text>
  <text start="969.17" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s just something that they had to</text>
  <text start="971.06" dur="4.08">do to catch up to YouTube and Twitter</text>
  <text start="973.25" dur="4.709">and Facebook with the other algorithms</text>
  <text start="975.14" dur="4.009">out there okay well I want to be clear I</text>
  <text start="977.959" dur="3.091">didn&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="979.149" dur="3.611">anything happened I just said there was</text>
  <text start="981.05" dur="3.33">controversy over it so you&amp;#39;re saying it</text>
  <text start="982.76" dur="4.8">now and we&amp;#39;ll keep Yap for the record so</text>

  <text start="1408.72" dur="4.949">holding the special for about a week and</text>

  <text start="1440.249" dur="4.231">you know less than $2 u.s. then</text>
  <text start="1442.47" dur="3.75">hopefully that&amp;#39;s enough incentive for</text>
  <text start="1444.48" dur="3.779">you to go in and not a lot of people do</text>
  <text start="1446.22" dur="5.64">this but go in and do a review when you</text>

  <text start="1506.49" dur="5.73">all right on with the questions the</text>
  <text start="1509.19" dur="6.92">fifth question is what is Q or not and</text>
  <text start="1512.22" dur="6">why is the Q community so engaged</text>
  <text start="1516.11" dur="3.52">involvement engagement is the single</text>
  <text start="1518.22" dur="4.86">toughest thing to do in business in the</text>
  <text start="1519.63" dur="5.49">marketing and what&amp;#39;s stunning to me is I</text>
  <text start="1523.08" dur="6.9">see this on television in Hong Kong I</text>
  <text start="1525.12" dur="7.32">see it overseas in Far East European</text>

  <text start="1540.03" dur="4.889">there in the snow so I think all the</text>
  <text start="1542.19" dur="4.859">continents have been represented what is</text>
  <text start="1544.919" dur="5.371">this few non community and movement and</text>
  <text start="1547.049" dur="4.831">why are people so engaged because</text>
  <text start="1550.29" dur="4.92">engagement is the single toughest thing</text>
  <text start="1551.88" dur="5.49">to do in business and marketing so - I</text>
  <text start="1555.21" dur="4.98">want to differentiate between the Q team</text>
  <text start="1557.37" dur="4.77">and the Q movement the Q team is what</text>
  <text start="1560.19" dur="4.35">President Trump has done to go around</text>
  <text start="1562.14" dur="5.1">the DOJ and the FBI just like he went</text>
  <text start="1564.54" dur="4.98">around the fake news with Twitter he</text>

  <text start="1569.52" dur="4.44">goes directly to the people with the Q</text>
  <text start="1571.41" dur="4.56">movement the Q team now what that has</text>
  <text start="1573.96" dur="4.05">done with the constant proofs from</text>
  <text start="1575.97" dur="4.02">websites like you proofs calm and the</text>
  <text start="1578.01" dur="3.87">constant verifications from Trump and</text>
  <text start="1579.99" dur="3.45">foreknowledge events things like that</text>
  <text start="1581.88" dur="3.72">predictions that turned out to be right</text>
  <text start="1583.44" dur="4.26">classified knowledge that Q knew about</text>
  <text start="1585.6" dur="4.44">before anyone else had known about her</text>
  <text start="1587.7" dur="3.99">before became public these things have</text>
  <text start="1590.04" dur="4.08">created a movement and the movement</text>
  <text start="1591.69" dur="4.89">itself you know for lack of a better</text>
  <text start="1594.12" dur="4.89">word or phrase it&amp;#39;s a worldwide</text>
  <text start="1596.58" dur="3.75">anti-corruption push and people are</text>
  <text start="1599.01" dur="3.12">really fired up about that because</text>
  <text start="1600.33" dur="2.849">everyone sees the corruption everyone</text>
  <text start="1602.13" dur="3.389">sees how bad its</text>

  <text start="1681.389" dur="4.321">office and his Dental Society his name</text>
  <text start="1683.969" dur="3.991">is no longer with us but I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1685.71" dur="4.889">listening dr. Erwin Smigel his wife</text>
  <text start="1687.96" dur="5.819">Lucia was my boss and we had an office</text>
  <text start="1690.599" dur="6.5">at Madison Avenue around 59th Street in</text>
  <text start="1693.779" dur="7.56">Manhattan and the Trump&amp;#39;s happen to be</text>
  <text start="1697.099" dur="7.15">patients of his so I got to see Don Jr I</text>
  <text start="1701.339" dur="4.861">got to see Ivanka but as children right</text>
  <text start="1704.249" dur="4.64">now I&amp;#39;m 55 so they&amp;#39;re younger than I am</text>
  <text start="1706.2" dur="5.88">and that was back in the day when</text>
  <text start="1708.889" dur="5.77">President Trump and Ivana Trump were</text>
  <text start="1712.08" dur="4.199">married and what I remember is the</text>
  <text start="1714.659" dur="4.95">Donald Trump I knew back then isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="1716.279" dur="5.7">way the media expresses him to be today</text>
  <text start="1719.609" dur="4.711">that Bill Clinton who I briefly knew</text>
  <text start="1721.979" dur="3.961">back in the day is still the same Bill</text>
  <text start="1724.32" dur="4.76">Clinton the way it&amp;#39;s expressed in the</text>
  <text start="1725.94" dur="6.299">media so I saw this difference of</text>
  <text start="1729.08" dur="4.269">opinion and so it kind of scratching my</text>
  <text start="1732.239" dur="3.51">head like why is that</text>
  <text start="1733.349" dur="3.361">you know I want to be agnostic but why</text>
  <text start="1735.749" dur="2.28">is that happening</text>
  <text start="1736.71" dur="4.829">now that is not a political statement</text>
  <text start="1738.029" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s a fact and so I happen to enjoy</text>
  <text start="1741.539" dur="4.531">both interviews both gentlemen pretended</text>
  <text start="1744.029" dur="3.661">like I was the only one who existed at</text>
  <text start="1746.07" dur="3.77">the time between eye contact and</text>
  <text start="1747.69" dur="5.16">attention and engagement so I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="1749.84" dur="5.77">blessed and I guess fortunate for having</text>
  <text start="1752.85" dur="5.069">those brief interviews but one remains</text>
  <text start="1755.61" dur="3.99">the same in public near the one changed</text>
  <text start="1757.919" dur="4.14">somehow after becoming president and I</text>
  <text start="1759.6" dur="3.63">couldn&amp;#39;t understand it especially when</text>
  <text start="1762.059" dur="3.211">he was friends with many of the people</text>
  <text start="1763.23" dur="4.5">who are going after him so that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1765.27" dur="5.46">got me interested from almost like a</text>
  <text start="1767.73" dur="4.829">morbid curiosity like why I don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="1770.73" dur="5.25">I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know him to be that</text>
  <text start="1772.559" dur="5.281">way so I want to know and this is a fair</text>
  <text start="1775.98" dur="4.25">question let&amp;#39;s take off our shoes before</text>
  <text start="1777.84" dur="5.819">putting them into someone else&amp;#39;s shoes</text>
  <text start="1780.23" dur="7.48">there&amp;#39;s got to be an anti Q movement and</text>
  <text start="1783.659" dur="6.291">if the answer is yes why is there that</text>
  <text start="1787.71" dur="6.36">movement other than the yin and yang of</text>
  <text start="1789.95" dur="5.709">humanity is there one and why is there</text>
  <text start="1794.07" dur="4.229">one because I think there&amp;#39;s several that</text>
  <text start="1795.659" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;ve anticipated and I&amp;#39;ve seen but you</text>
  <text start="1798.299" dur="3">would know better than I that&amp;#39;s an easy</text>
  <text start="1800.909" dur="2.611">one</text>
  <text start="1801.299" dur="3.841">there is an anti Q anon movement it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1803.52" dur="3.84">called the mainstream corporate media</text>
  <text start="1805.14" dur="3.899">and they&amp;#39;ve attacked q and on more than</text>
  <text start="1807.36" dur="4.049">any other topic out there other than</text>
  <text start="1809.039" dur="4.471">Trump himself so it&amp;#39;s the second most</text>
  <text start="1811.409" dur="4.051">attacked thing out there they call it</text>
  <text start="1813.51" dur="3.84">names they used ridicule and they use ad</text>
  <text start="1815.46" dur="3.599">homonyms and they go after specific</text>
  <text start="1817.35" dur="3.54">people that have nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="1819.059" dur="3.691">movement and they try to you know impune</text>
  <text start="1820.89" dur="4.2">the entire movement off of those few</text>
  <text start="1822.75" dur="3.57">crazy people&amp;#39;s motivations but really</text>
  <text start="1825.09" dur="4.14">what they&amp;#39;ve done is they&amp;#39;ve declared</text>
  <text start="1826.32" dur="5.67">war on q and on and on independent media</text>
  <text start="1829.23" dur="4.29">and that coalescing into big tech doing</text>
  <text start="1831.99" dur="4.23">what they&amp;#39;re doing now with censoring us</text>
  <text start="1833.52" dur="5.73">out so Q really was a movement to build</text>
  <text start="1836.22" dur="5.25">a citizen journalist army you know a</text>
  <text start="1839.25" dur="4.47">us-based citizen or even worldwide based</text>
  <text start="1841.47" dur="4.11">citizen journalist army to expose the</text>
  <text start="1843.72" dur="3.36">fake news lies so they don&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="1845.58" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re the competition they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1847.08" dur="4.17">trying to shut us down well I&amp;#39;ve also</text>
  <text start="1849.27" dur="4.259">noticed and I want you to be fair as you</text>
  <text start="1851.25" dur="4.529">possibly can with objectivity if there</text>
  <text start="1853.529" dur="3.421">is such a thing one philosopher said</text>
  <text start="1855.779" dur="3.211">there are no truth there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="1856.95" dur="6.12">interpretations of the truth so</text>
  <text start="1858.99" dur="7.169">hopefully I&amp;#39;m fair in that statement but</text>
  <text start="1863.07" dur="5.79">there are also Trump supporters who are</text>
  <text start="1866.159" dur="4.321">anti Q because Q has been stealing</text>
  <text start="1868.86" dur="2.79">limelight from them</text>
  <text start="1870.48" dur="2.85">you speak to that just a little bit</text>
  <text start="1871.65" dur="4.14">because I would be remiss if I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1873.33" dur="3.96">answer that question we have a we have a</text>
  <text start="1875.79" dur="4.23">phrase in the Q movement for these folks</text>
  <text start="1877.29" dur="5.28">and we call them fake Magga and you know</text>
  <text start="1880.02" dur="4.23">there just seems to be a pattern among</text>
  <text start="1882.57" dur="3.93">certain people I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and use</text>
  <text start="1884.25" dur="4.02">Alex Jones as an example it&amp;#39;s not a big</text>
  <text start="1886.5" dur="5.76">secret that he and I have had some</text>
  <text start="1888.27" dur="5.85">Tiff&amp;#39;s in the past around Q on there are</text>
  <text start="1892.26" dur="3.72">people that just don&amp;#39;t seem to like Alex</text>
  <text start="1894.12" dur="3.42">Jones there there&amp;#39;s a circle of them</text>
  <text start="1895.98" dur="3.75">most of them are connected Alex and have</text>
  <text start="1897.54" dur="4.379">been on his show and they just seem to</text>
  <text start="1899.73" dur="3.689">consider it a threat maybe a market</text>
  <text start="1901.919" dur="2.191">share threat or something and and I</text>
  <text start="1903.419" dur="3.061">don&amp;#39;t know for sure</text>
  <text start="1904.11" dur="4.59">q has actually made some allegations</text>
  <text start="1906.48" dur="4.02">about Alex Jones and those around him as</text>
  <text start="1908.7" dur="3.63">maybe being you know foreign agents and</text>
  <text start="1910.5" dur="4.169">things like that so without going too</text>
  <text start="1912.33" dur="5.78">far into it generally when I find people</text>
  <text start="1914.669" dur="5.64">that are pro Trump anti Q they&amp;#39;re either</text>
  <text start="1918.11" dur="4.18">consistently going anti Q like eight</text>
  <text start="1920.309" dur="4.531">hours a day for example trying to create</text>
  <text start="1922.29" dur="5.1">evidence to debunk it for example Jack</text>
  <text start="1924.84" dur="4.65">Pacific with his Oh a and debunk of Q</text>
  <text start="1927.39" dur="4.77">and on which I was cured for debunking</text>
  <text start="1929.49" dur="4.47">actually and then there are people that</text>
  <text start="1932.16" dur="3.269">just seem to go after it with lies and</text>
  <text start="1933.96" dur="3.599">then they they never seem to change</text>
  <text start="1935.429" dur="4.531">their mind if you if you correct them on</text>
  <text start="1937.559" dur="4.711">something or you debate with them or you</text>
  <text start="1939.96" dur="4.23">engage friendly conversation with them</text>
  <text start="1942.27" dur="3.33">even if you correct something you&amp;#39;ll say</text>
  <text start="1944.19" dur="3.119">you&amp;#39;ll see them 20 minutes later on a</text>
  <text start="1945.6" dur="3.27">different post on Twitter saying to say</text>
  <text start="1947.309" dur="3.781">hi to someone else it&amp;#39;s almost as though</text>
  <text start="1948.87" dur="5.46">they don&amp;#39;t really want to tell the truth</text>
  <text start="1951.09" dur="5.25">they just want to destroy Q and and I</text>
  <text start="1954.33" dur="5.21">would say that you know we have rhinos</text>
  <text start="1956.34" dur="6.9">we have folks within the Republican</text>

  <text start="1970.71" dur="5.28">pro-impeachment Drudge being one example</text>
  <text start="1973.47" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s Pro impeachment and these are just</text>
  <text start="1975.99" dur="4.35">a couple of the bigger voices out there</text>
  <text start="1977.76" dur="4.02">but certain folks find Q threatening</text>
  <text start="1980.34" dur="3.209">maybe because they&amp;#39;re part of the deep</text>
  <text start="1981.78" dur="3.87">state despite being Republicans or</text>
  <text start="1983.549" dur="4.861">because they they may be considered a</text>
  <text start="1985.65" dur="5.49">market share threat okay here&amp;#39;s where I</text>
  <text start="1988.41" dur="4.83">get confused because I remember my son</text>
  <text start="1991.14" dur="3.24">used to love to watch my son&amp;#39;s now in</text>

  <text start="2020.39" dur="7.11">claim so you could argue that you know</text>
  <text start="2025.52" dur="4.32">Fox News helped Trump get elected in a</text>

  <text start="2458.73" dur="5.849">finally a question that I can stand by</text>

  <text start="2464.579" dur="5.551">or nonpartisan in your opinion unfair</text>
  <text start="2468.15" dur="3.689">question because it&amp;#39;s an opinion but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2470.13" dur="4.83">gonna make it and ask it anyway what are</text>
  <text start="2471.839" dur="5.041">your thoughts it is both it&amp;#39;s partisan</text>
  <text start="2474.96" dur="3.84">in the sense that it&amp;#39;s primarily on the</text>
  <text start="2476.88" dur="3.87">right because you know the folks on the</text>
  <text start="2478.8" dur="3.569">Left have either they&amp;#39;ve walked away now</text>
  <text start="2480.75" dur="4.44">from the Democrat Party or they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="2482.369" dur="6.151">sort of being misled I would say by the</text>
  <text start="2485.19" dur="8.1">news media so it&amp;#39;s a bit of both in that</text>
  <text start="2488.52" dur="7.559">sense but I I guess if I had to say it</text>
  <text start="2493.29" dur="5.279">would still be officially like</text>
  <text start="2496.079" dur="4.351">technically a nonpartisan but there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2511.47" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s I would say a direct result of</text>
  <text start="2513.359" dur="3.871">independent media pushing back against</text>
  <text start="2515.46" dur="3.93">the fake news talking points on a daily</text>

  <text start="3089.35" dur="7.09">publisher I believe husband-and-wife</text>

  <text start="3097.94" dur="4.05">just about life it&amp;#39;s about death as well</text>
  <text start="3100.31" dur="4.11">why do you think the publisher got</text>
  <text start="3101.99" dur="4.29">behind this book its controversial in</text>
  <text start="3104.42" dur="3.15">some cases many people think it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3135.8" dur="5.19">something else that we talked about and</text>
  <text start="3137.3" dur="4.86">this idea kind of came up and later on</text>

  <text start="3363.86" dur="4.2">according to the book so you can look</text>
  <text start="3366.05" dur="3.57">that up as well it&amp;#39;s available on Kindle</text>
  <text start="3368.06" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;re not a virtual book tour for them</text>

  <text start="3373.76" dur="2.85">over again</text>
  <text start="3374.36" dur="4.56">right now and there&amp;#39;s a reason for that</text>
  <text start="3376.61" dur="3.72">so there is a movement it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3378.92" dur="3.84">going to stay here forever it swings</text>
  <text start="3380.33" dur="5.61">back and forth it&amp;#39;s not a circle it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="3391.7" dur="5.19">topics of books whether it&amp;#39;s political</text>
  <text start="3394.19" dur="5.64">movements bottom line is the we movement</text>
  <text start="3396.89" dur="5.73">is we&amp;#39;re okay and all of you are not</text>
  <text start="3399.83" dur="5.55">okay and the me movement is I&amp;#39;m okay</text>
  <text start="3402.62" dur="5.91">you&amp;#39;re not okay we is a lot more</text>
  <text start="3405.38" dur="6">difficult to sidestep because there are</text>
  <text start="3408.53" dur="5.58">entitled entire movements and you can go</text>
  <text start="3411.38" dur="4.08">back to the the beginnings of the</text>

  <text start="3420.2" dur="5.4">interesting book for you to consider but</text>
  <text start="3422.18" dur="5.64">the way to get the word out is to share</text>
  <text start="3425.6" dur="5.07">and this will go on your own Facebook</text>
  <text start="3427.82" dur="4.59">you can put a little post right above it</text>
  <text start="3430.67" dur="4.32">to give you a recommendation if it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="3432.41" dur="4.2">Facebook you can post as well</text>
  <text start="3434.99" dur="4.14">you can post and you can comment now</text>
  <text start="3436.61" dur="5.19">share is I think the highest level one</text>
  <text start="3439.13" dur="5.22">share is worth a hundred posts in one</text>
  <text start="3441.8" dur="5.01">post is worth a hundred comments so you</text>
  <text start="3444.35" dur="3.81">can decide on how valuable a share is</text>
  <text start="3446.81" dur="3.15">because a share is you&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="3448.16" dur="4.56">yourself on the line and your own</text>
  <text start="3449.96" dur="5.31">reputation which is easy to lose but</text>
  <text start="3452.72" dur="5.67">difficult to build which is why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3455.27" dur="4.71">taking a risk here but it&amp;#39;s a calculated</text>
  <text start="3458.39" dur="3.45">risk now whether you&amp;#39;re watching on</text>
  <text start="3459.98" dur="3.87">youtube you can share that if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3461.84" dur="4.53">watching on periscope you can share that</text>
  <text start="3463.85" dur="4.98">as well you can use email wherever you</text>
  <text start="3466.37" dur="4.74">are and watching this or listening to it</text>
  <text start="3468.83" dur="3.51">you can share it if you wish and if you</text>
  <text start="3471.11" dur="3.3">don&amp;#39;t and you think it&amp;#39;s a little too</text>
  <text start="3472.34" dur="3.18">risky I totally understand because</text>
  <text start="3474.41" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s my position for the</text>
  <text start="3475.52" dur="6.18">three years all right now what is the</text>
  <text start="3478.55" dur="5.28">end game of the Q movement</text>
  <text start="3481.7" dur="4.47">okay what&amp;#39;s the end game of the Great</text>
  <text start="3483.83" dur="3.51">Awakening okay what are we gonna end up</text>
  <text start="3486.17" dur="4.98">with let&amp;#39;s begin with the end in mind</text>
  <text start="3487.34" dur="5.43">right now so people talk a lot about in</text>
  <text start="3491.15" dur="3.36">the Q movement the sealed indictments</text>
  <text start="3492.77" dur="3.42">and D coming mass arrests</text>
  <text start="3494.51" dur="2.97">you know people you&amp;#39;ve gotten off on a</text>
  <text start="3496.19" dur="3.12">lot of tangents in the Q movement not</text>
  <text start="3497.48" dur="3.81">all of them are correct we&amp;#39;ve got on</text>
  <text start="3499.31" dur="3.96">some branches like JFK jr. and things</text>
  <text start="3501.29" dur="4.92">like that and you know I have a part to</text>
  <text start="3503.27" dur="8.67">play in that as well but I would say</text>
  <text start="3506.21" dur="8.67">more than anything how to answer this</text>
  <text start="3511.94" dur="4.86">one man I don&amp;#39;t know on this one just</text>
  <text start="3514.88" dur="4.32">answer it from the heart because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3516.8" dur="3.93">gonna get an anti argument either way so</text>
  <text start="3519.2" dur="5.07">just answer it and don&amp;#39;t spend too much</text>
  <text start="3520.73" dur="8.04">time well you know what in the in the Q</text>
  <text start="3524.27" dur="5.67">movement sense um I don&amp;#39;t know ask me</text>
  <text start="3528.77" dur="2.4">the question again if you don&amp;#39;t mind cuz</text>
  <text start="3529.94" dur="3.03">I kind of went off on a tangent in my</text>
  <text start="3531.17" dur="4.62">mind about how to answer it and the</text>
  <text start="3532.97" dur="4.71">question is what&amp;#39;s the endgame Q a</text>
  <text start="3535.79" dur="4.62">non-movement like where do we want to</text>
  <text start="3537.68" dur="5.07">end up is there an end to it and where</text>
  <text start="3540.41" dur="3.72">do we end up so the ending and I kind of</text>
  <text start="3542.75" dur="3.18">went back around to the hundred and</text>
  <text start="3544.13" dur="3.15">forty thousand and Counting sold</text>
  <text start="3545.93" dur="3.54">indictments and things like that that</text>
  <text start="3547.28" dur="3.75">the mass arrests that are coming people</text>
  <text start="3549.47" dur="3.57">hear this and they either they make a</text>
  <text start="3551.03" dur="3.6">decision they&amp;#39;re like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m all for it</text>
  <text start="3553.04" dur="3.27">I want to see it happen or that&amp;#39;s insane</text>
  <text start="3554.63" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;ll never that that&amp;#39;ll never happen is</text>
  <text start="3556.31" dur="4.14">conspiracy theory it&amp;#39;s a LARP now you</text>
  <text start="3558.56" dur="3.78">could go to pacer gov which is a</text>
  <text start="3560.45" dur="3.35">government website and you can get proof</text>
  <text start="3562.34" dur="3.84">that these hundred and forty plus</text>
  <text start="3563.8" dur="4.18">growing by five thousand a month sealed</text>
  <text start="3566.18" dur="3.93">indictments are happening these are real</text>
  <text start="3567.98" dur="3.99">these are typical for years one or two</text>
  <text start="3570.11" dur="4.44">thousand so this is a hundred and forty</text>
  <text start="3571.97" dur="4.26">thousand and growing there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="3574.55" dur="3.72">happening behind the scenes this deep</text>
  <text start="3576.23" dur="4.29">state war that&amp;#39;s now all the way to</text>

  <text start="3580.52" dur="5.39">been heating up so I think that the</text>
  <text start="3582.8" dur="5.79">final resolution of this is gonna be</text>
  <text start="3585.91" dur="4.63">sort of a golden era Trump&amp;#39;s gonna win</text>
  <text start="3588.59" dur="3.99">2020 we&amp;#39;re gonna have arrests of</text>
  <text start="3590.54" dur="3.66">treasonous people within our deep state</text>
  <text start="3592.58" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re gonna set some examples of them</text>
  <text start="3594.2" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re going to kind of clean up our</text>
  <text start="3596.03" dur="4.35">economy and maybe even end up with a</text>
  <text start="3598.52" dur="3.9">gold standard because I also think and</text>
  <text start="3600.38" dur="4.56">he was touched on this that the economy</text>
  <text start="3602.42" dur="4.41">is starting to fall apart the everything</text>
  <text start="3604.94" dur="3.15">bubble is collapsing and of course</text>
  <text start="3606.83" dur="2.64">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to bring it down the</text>
  <text start="3608.09" dur="2.91">stop Trump anyway so</text>
  <text start="3609.47" dur="4.08">you know we&amp;#39;re in an interesting time</text>
  <text start="3611" dur="4.23">for sure so that&amp;#39;s as I see at the end</text>
  <text start="3613.55" dur="4.47">result of the queue movements stop</text>
  <text start="3615.23" dur="4.74">corruption here now you know more than I</text>

  <text start="3624.56" dur="2.82">many people watching know a lot more</text>
  <text start="3625.91" dur="3.27">than I do my knowledge is like a piece</text>

  <text start="3629.18" dur="5.31">compared to most of you running your</text>
  <text start="3631.28" dur="7.8">citizen reporter channels politically I</text>
  <text start="3634.49" dur="8.84">believe based on my experience that the</text>
  <text start="3639.08" dur="7.529">end game is simply the importance of</text>
  <text start="3643.33" dur="6.25">awakening people so that they realize</text>
  <text start="3646.609" dur="6.271">that clandestine operations are</text>
  <text start="3649.58" dur="5.73">happening all the time and that no</text>

  <text start="3675.44" dur="4.919">still living who claim that it happened</text>
  <text start="3678.17" dur="4.38">well that kind of thing can&amp;#39;t happen is</text>
  <text start="3680.359" dur="5.371">readily anymore it can&amp;#39;t happen in</text>

  <text start="3689.839" dur="5.491">there&amp;#39;s darkness so an awakening I</text>
  <text start="3691.76" dur="6.12">believe is using sunlight as a</text>
  <text start="3695.33" dur="4.89">disinfectant and people being awakened</text>
  <text start="3697.88" dur="4.41">to it and it&amp;#39;s a democratization just</text>
  <text start="3700.22" dur="3.54">like Dustin you won&amp;#39;t remember this is</text>
  <text start="3702.29" dur="3.24">back in the day I used to buy a record</text>
  <text start="3703.76" dur="4.68">and there were record stores and I had</text>
  <text start="3705.53" dur="4.92">to buy all of the songs on the record</text>
  <text start="3708.44" dur="3.659">there were 45s and there was a b-side</text>
  <text start="3710.45" dur="3.36">and an a side I listened to the a side</text>
  <text start="3712.099" dur="4.111">and the B side never got played there</text>
  <text start="3713.81" dur="3.93">were cassette tapes there were CDs some</text>
  <text start="3716.21" dur="3.21">people are going what but this is a</text>
  <text start="3717.74" dur="4.349">pencil that I&amp;#39;m holding in my hand</text>
  <text start="3719.42" dur="4.41">millenials going what is that right now</text>
  <text start="3722.089" dur="3.601">this is a pencil that I&amp;#39;m holding that</text>
  <text start="3723.83" dur="3.69">hasn&amp;#39;t been sharpened this is one that</text>
  <text start="3725.69" dur="4.71">has more wisdom and has been used and</text>
  <text start="3727.52" dur="5.25">then I guess the wisest pencil of all is</text>
  <text start="3730.4" dur="3.51">the one that is the smallest one which</text>
  <text start="3732.77" dur="2.94">is the one I&amp;#39;m holding in my hand right</text>
  <text start="3733.91" dur="4.05">now because it has gone through more</text>
  <text start="3735.71" dur="4.44">intelligence now I&amp;#39;m just saying that so</text>
  <text start="3737.96" dur="4.77">that I look smart I know I don&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="3740.15" dur="3.24">bottom line is this when people are</text>
  <text start="3742.73" dur="3.18">awakened</text>
  <text start="3743.39" dur="4.469">then atrocities cannot happen in the</text>
  <text start="3745.91" dur="4.29">dark and I&amp;#39;m talking about atrocities</text>
  <text start="3747.859" dur="4.081">such as genocide so I think ultimately</text>
  <text start="3750.2" dur="5.159">we&amp;#39;re part of the endgame right now</text>
  <text start="3751.94" dur="5.849">I think there is no end there there is</text>

  <text start="3757.789" dur="4.471">process of awakening the pendulum will</text>
  <text start="3759.92" dur="4.74">swing back eventually that&amp;#39;s my opinion</text>
  <text start="3762.26" dur="4.589">and yes if their indictments yes if</text>
  <text start="3764.66" dur="5.459">people go to jail yes if there are perp</text>
  <text start="3766.849" dur="5.97">walks who knows but we&amp;#39;re part of the</text>
  <text start="3770.119" dur="6.061">endgame right now and when people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3772.819" dur="4.74">have patience about what&amp;#39;s happening I</text>
  <text start="3776.18" dur="3.03">just tell them well I wish you were a</text>

  <text start="4027.22" dur="4.41">same is true with this movement and any</text>

  <text start="4051.58" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s a suspension bridge going to it</text>

  <text start="4096.34" dur="5.79">done great interview by the way very</text>
  <text start="4097.51" dur="7.77">fair in my opinion here&amp;#39;s one are the</text>
  <text start="4102.13" dur="5.85">queue followers guilty of their own</text>
  <text start="4105.28" dur="5.1">confirmation biases or projections</text>
  <text start="4107.98" dur="3.96">projection psychologically I&amp;#39;ve used</text>
  <text start="4110.38" dur="3.99">that term many years psychologists know</text>
  <text start="4111.94" dur="3.75">about it it&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;re projecting on</text>
  <text start="4114.37" dur="4.2">someone else of what you&amp;#39;re either</text>
  <text start="4115.69" dur="4.92">guilty of or what you know to be true a</text>
  <text start="4118.57" dur="4.98">dear friend of mine who is a joint</text>
  <text start="4120.61" dur="5.1">venture partner in 2005 I approached him</text>
  <text start="4123.55" dur="4.38">I said you know and I won&amp;#39;t mention his</text>
  <text start="4125.71" dur="3.84">name because I&amp;#39;ll keep him anonymous I</text>
  <text start="4127.93" dur="4.35">said you really care for your students</text>
  <text start="4129.55" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m really impressed of how much you</text>
  <text start="4132.28" dur="3.39">care for your students I saw him on</text>
  <text start="4133.39" dur="5.01">stage and he was gonna have me teach his</text>
  <text start="4135.67" dur="4.98">training and then fast forward five</text>
  <text start="4138.4" dur="3.81">years I said hey listen why did you ever</text>
  <text start="4140.65" dur="3.12">invite me there&amp;#39;s so many other speakers</text>
  <text start="4142.21" dur="2.279">you can invite they&amp;#39;re a lot taller</text>
  <text start="4143.77" dur="3.059">there</text>
  <text start="4144.489" dur="3.87">smarter they&amp;#39;re more appealing to have</text>
  <text start="4146.829" dur="4.02">more reach than I do why me</text>
  <text start="4148.359" dur="4.32">he said well I&amp;#39;m structured for</text>
  <text start="4150.849" dur="5.281">projections I said what do you mean he</text>
  <text start="4152.679" dur="6.12">said you told me you admired me taking</text>
  <text start="4156.13" dur="4.439">care of my students on stage and that is</text>
  <text start="4158.799" dur="4.05">you projecting what&amp;#39;s important to you</text>
  <text start="4160.569" dur="4.53">so I knew without a shadow of a doubt</text>
  <text start="4162.849" dur="4.65">that I could trust you because you would</text>
  <text start="4165.099" dur="4.41">care from my students as well so that is</text>
  <text start="4167.499" dur="4.171">psychological projection spun in a</text>
  <text start="4169.509" dur="4.471">positive light there&amp;#39;s also the</text>
  <text start="4171.67" dur="3.839">projection of we are what we complain</text>
  <text start="4173.98" dur="3.779">about so if you complain about something</text>
  <text start="4175.509" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re projecting if you don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="4177.759" dur="3.78">something in someone else well if you</text>
  <text start="4179.259" dur="4.08">spot it you got it I hate to tell you so</text>
  <text start="4181.539" dur="3.3">whether you&amp;#39;re married or divorced or</text>
  <text start="4183.339" dur="3.27">you see things in your children that you</text>
  <text start="4184.839" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t want to you know seeing yourself</text>
  <text start="4186.609" dur="4.14">projections a great learning tool so</text>
  <text start="4188.829" dur="4.14">what are the projections that the cue</text>
  <text start="4190.749" dur="4.381">movement followers have in your opinion</text>
  <text start="4192.969" dur="4.621">which by the way is a projection to be</text>
  <text start="4195.13" dur="4.199">fair you know first I want to say that</text>
  <text start="4197.59" dur="3.96">was a great breakdown of the Socratic</text>
  <text start="4199.329" dur="4.44">method and it&amp;#39;s what cue uses to educate</text>
  <text start="4201.55" dur="4.379">through questioning but there there have</text>
  <text start="4203.769" dur="4.261">been some projections with the movement</text>
  <text start="4205.929" dur="4.86">and one example I brought up briefly</text>
  <text start="4208.03" dur="5.339">earlier is JFK jr. they they want to</text>
  <text start="4210.789" dur="4.35">believe in this epic story of JFK jr.</text>
  <text start="4213.369" dur="3.451">coming back from the dead and in saving</text>
  <text start="4215.139" dur="3.36">us and that when they you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4216.82" dur="3.929">going off on a limb I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="4218.499" dur="4.29">people buy that but Hughes has debunked</text>
  <text start="4220.749" dur="4.35">it himself and I stood next to the guy</text>
  <text start="4222.789" dur="5.401">and he&amp;#39;s too short you know great guy</text>
  <text start="4225.099" dur="7.951">though Vincent fusca other projections</text>
  <text start="4228.19" dur="6.449">you know people they see they see what</text>
  <text start="4233.05" dur="3.299">they want to see they they project every</text>
  <text start="4234.639" dur="3.69">crime imaginable on every bad guy in</text>
  <text start="4236.349" dur="3.48">some cases we have our magical thinkers</text>
  <text start="4238.329" dur="3.96">and the commitment as well not everyone</text>
  <text start="4239.829" dur="4.5">is super logical so they they they</text>
  <text start="4242.289" dur="3.66">sometimes will spread false accusations</text>
  <text start="4244.329" dur="3.901">and that generally that&amp;#39;s not the case</text>
  <text start="4245.949" dur="4.44">but I&amp;#39;ve seen it happen so I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="4248.23" dur="3.509">just kind of go down and like knock some</text>
  <text start="4250.389" dur="3.6">of the things that I&amp;#39;ve seen the Cuban</text>
  <text start="4251.739" dur="4.26">with that I didn&amp;#39;t like you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4253.989" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s been some factionalism and some</text>
  <text start="4255.999" dur="3.841">backbiting and things like that but you</text>
  <text start="4258.099" dur="5.25">know projections and other things</text>
  <text start="4259.84" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s been weaknesses one big example</text>
  <text start="4263.349" dur="4.471">is sessions everybody said sessions was</text>
  <text start="4265.9" dur="3.81">the silent executioner and that&amp;#39;s our</text>

  <text start="4322.57" dur="4.08">things like that are a problem in the Q</text>

  <text start="4326.65" dur="3.09">the thing there&amp;#39;s an awakening to that</text>
  <text start="4328.51" dur="3.33">as well when you know what your own</text>

  <text start="4338.8" dur="4.11">question I will tell you when people say</text>
  <text start="4340.6" dur="4.5">Alex how do you have a good reputation</text>
  <text start="4342.91" dur="3.42">after being in digital marketing for</text>
  <text start="4345.1" dur="3.81">nearly 25 years</text>
  <text start="4346.33" dur="4.95">and I tell them two answers the first is</text>
  <text start="4348.91" dur="4.65">well I&amp;#39;m more willing to look bad in</text>
  <text start="4351.28" dur="4.32">public than you are so I take more</text>
  <text start="4353.56" dur="3.96">calculated risk embarrassment seems to</text>
  <text start="4355.6" dur="4.17">be the number one reason why people</text>
  <text start="4357.52" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t take those types of risks and in</text>
  <text start="4359.77" dur="3.18">my business in marketing and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4361.66" dur="3.06">find that to be true with citizen</text>
  <text start="4362.95" dur="2.85">reporters I gain courage just watching</text>
  <text start="4364.72" dur="3.84">what some of these folks are saying</text>
  <text start="4365.8" dur="5.73">because it&amp;#39;s mind-boggling the risk that</text>
  <text start="4368.56" dur="5.22">they take and the the subscribers that</text>
  <text start="4371.53" dur="5.04">they lose as a result of speaking their</text>

  <text start="4378.79" dur="5.58">I believe the second question the second</text>
  <text start="4383.05" dur="3.39">answer I give to that same question is</text>
  <text start="4384.37" dur="4.62">the truth the way you have a good</text>
  <text start="4386.44" dur="6.42">reputation is to keep the people who are</text>

  <text start="4421.27" dur="3.51">the love side loathing and loving</text>
  <text start="4423.07" dur="4.17">opposite sides of the same sort right</text>
  <text start="4424.78" dur="4.38">the opposite of love is not hate</text>

  <text start="4481.66" dur="3.75">side of the other and they&amp;#39;re gonna jump</text>
  <text start="4483.16" dur="6.06">so what would be the message to them</text>
  <text start="4485.41" dur="6.36">vested I would say for that crowd don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4489.22" dur="4.92">get into the logical fallacies of saying</text>
  <text start="4491.77" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s a larper it&amp;#39;s this insult or that</text>
  <text start="4494.14" dur="3.27">insult that&amp;#39;s an appeal to really kill</text>
  <text start="4495.67" dur="3.93">it it&amp;#39;s which I might debate earlier and</text>
  <text start="4497.41" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a bad argument don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="4499.6" dur="4.05">into people that attack specific</text>
  <text start="4501.43" dur="4.47">messengers instead of the message go</text>
  <text start="4503.65" dur="3.75">after the message itself get a Q post</text>
  <text start="4505.9" dur="3.96">look at the questions he asked the</text>

  <text start="4518.77" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;ll upset you and make you mad but</text>
  <text start="4521.35" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s the cool that&amp;#39;s what an</text>
  <text start="4522.43" dur="4.11">anti-corruption movement is supposed to</text>
  <text start="4524.29" dur="4.1">push you to do so go and look at Q</text>

  <text start="4536.68" dur="5.04">zero zero zero split-second no you know</text>
  <text start="4539.8" dur="4.65">budging at all from that in many cases</text>
  <text start="4541.72" dur="4.92">multiple times in one day as Trump</text>
  <text start="4544.45" dur="4.14">post something and you can go look at</text>
  <text start="4546.64" dur="3.87">foreknowledge of terrorist attacks</text>
  <text start="4548.59" dur="3.15">there&amp;#39;s a lot of different little things</text>
  <text start="4550.51" dur="4.4">that you could look at in there but</text>
  <text start="4551.74" dur="5.67">eventually there&amp;#39;s too many q incidences</text>
  <text start="4554.91" dur="4.66">for anyone to believe mathematically</text>
  <text start="4557.41" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s impossible there&amp;#39;s just too much</text>
  <text start="4559.57" dur="2.94">going on so if you go and you look at</text>
  <text start="4561.16" dur="3.24">that and you have a rational mind I</text>
  <text start="4562.51" dur="4.77">think that you can see ask some of the</text>
  <text start="4564.4" dur="4.65">JFK jr. and the the larb and the</text>
  <text start="4567.28" dur="4.08">conspiracy theory and all the insults</text>
  <text start="4569.05" dur="4.65">that the media uses and actually kind of</text>
  <text start="4571.36" dur="4.38">just ask yourself how would this be</text>
  <text start="4573.7" dur="4.53">possible if Trump was not working</text>
  <text start="4575.74" dur="3.93">directly with this team and you&amp;#39;ll come</text>
  <text start="4578.23" dur="3.72">to the same conclusion likely that I</text>
  <text start="4579.67" dur="3.66">haven&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s real they&amp;#39;re doing this to</text>
  <text start="4581.95" dur="3">get around the deep state just like</text>
  <text start="4583.33" dur="3.81">Trump is tweeting all the time to get</text>
  <text start="4584.95" dur="5.07">around fake news and actually makes</text>
  <text start="4587.14" dur="4.86">sense well I will add that it teaches</text>
  <text start="4590.02" dur="3.6">one thing that we don&amp;#39;t teach our kids</text>
  <text start="4592" dur="3.48">at least I know I haven&amp;#39;t until recently</text>
  <text start="4593.62" dur="4.23">and we don&amp;#39;t teach it in school and that</text>
  <text start="4595.48" dur="3.81">is critical thinking to be able to think</text>
  <text start="4597.85" dur="3.12">critically actually to put aside</text>
  <text start="4599.29" dur="3.96">thinking time one of my mentors who</text>
  <text start="4600.97" dur="3.74">lives in Austin other than different</text>
  <text start="4603.25" dur="4.17">mentor than the one I mentioned earlier</text>
  <text start="4604.71" dur="4.12">he has thinking time that he puts aside</text>
  <text start="4607.42" dur="2.88">and he just thinks and and makes</text>
  <text start="4608.83" dur="3.3">critical decisions based on that and</text>
  <text start="4610.3" dur="3.12">many people don&amp;#39;t do that and they make</text>
  <text start="4612.13" dur="2.58">decisions and the only thing worse than</text>
  <text start="4613.42" dur="3.17">going the wrong direction with a</text>

  <text start="4788.9" dur="4.77">and I can&amp;#39;t pronounce her last name</text>
  <text start="4791.69" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;ll call her Susan and everyone else</text>
  <text start="4793.67" dur="5.55">involved with YouTube love them or</text>

  <text start="4799.22" dur="5.46">get the word out so many times it even</text>
  <text start="4803.12" dur="3.51">if you consider them the enemy that</text>
  <text start="4804.68" dur="4.89">enemy is the host of getting your</text>
  <text start="4806.63" dur="5.25">message out and at the very least one</text>
  <text start="4809.57" dur="4.859">sliver of gratitude can go</text>

  <text start="4820.01" dur="4.56">right so I&amp;#39;m sure I lost all the</text>
  <text start="4822.02" dur="5.1">audience from that but one other thing</text>
  <text start="4824.57" dur="4.2">and one other source of gratitude and</text>
  <text start="4827.12" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m not a woowoo marketer here by the</text>
  <text start="4828.77" dur="4.679">way I&amp;#39;m you make money or you don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="4831.65" dur="4.62">money I&amp;#39;m very binary and my students</text>
  <text start="4833.449" dur="5.011">know that but I want to acknowledge</text>
  <text start="4836.27" dur="5.31">someone who&amp;#39;s no longer living he lived</text>
  <text start="4838.46" dur="6.779">in the 1400s there was at the turn of</text>
  <text start="4841.58" dur="7.17">the 21st century a television special I</text>
  <text start="4845.239" dur="6.091">think it was put on by biography or you</text>
  <text start="4848.75" dur="6.21">know something like that that has a lot</text>
  <text start="4851.33" dur="5.73">of biographies online and they listed</text>
  <text start="4854.96" dur="3.63">the hundred most influential people of</text>
  <text start="4857.06" dur="4.349">all time Bill Clinton made the list I</text>
  <text start="4858.59" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t know if Donald Trump did better or</text>
  <text start="4861.409" dur="3.601">didn&amp;#39;t but Bill Clinton was pretty far</text>
  <text start="4863.84" dur="4.41">up there and this was around the year</text>
  <text start="4865.01" dur="5.91">2000 2001 and what I remember is number</text>
  <text start="4868.25" dur="3.96">one shocked me and he is the final</text>
  <text start="4870.92" dur="3.45">person I like to extend some gratitude</text>
  <text start="4872.21" dur="5.61">towards and that&amp;#39;s Johannes Gutenberg</text>
  <text start="4874.37" dur="5.61">now the Gutenberg press was responsible</text>
  <text start="4877.82" dur="5.52">for printing the Gutenberg Bible which</text>
  <text start="4879.98" dur="5.67">was the first perfect bound book and</text>
  <text start="4883.34" dur="6.45">done and scale so that people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4885.65" dur="6">have to copy scripture or copy words or</text>
  <text start="4889.79" dur="4.619">you didn&amp;#39;t need monks to rewrite things</text>
  <text start="4891.65" dur="5.79">so that way let&amp;#39;s say a whole population</text>
  <text start="4894.409" dur="5.011">is is completely annihilated and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4897.44" dur="4.41">say Alexandria Egypt has a library and</text>
  <text start="4899.42" dur="4.38">all that is just incinerated and you</text>
  <text start="4901.85" dur="4.2">lose all this history the book has</text>
  <text start="4903.8" dur="3.48">really made a huge difference and the</text>
  <text start="4906.05" dur="4.53">qa9 book would not be here without</text>
  <text start="4907.28" dur="4.59">Johannes Gutenberg 1436 the whole thing</text>
  <text start="4910.58" dur="3.599">started there were some lawsuits</text>
  <text start="4911.87" dur="5.16">involved even back then his partner was</text>
  <text start="4914.179" dur="4.921">Andreas dressing and I&amp;#39;m probably</text>
  <text start="4917.03" dur="3.81">mispronouncing that anyone who&amp;#39;s German</text>
  <text start="4919.1" dur="4.289">or speaks it you probably were gonna</text>
  <text start="4920.84" dur="5.31">feel a me but get over it because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4923.389" dur="5.27">just trying to pay homage Gutenberg was</text>
  <text start="4926.15" dur="5.19">a gem cutter he was a goldsmith and</text>
  <text start="4928.659" dur="4.991">ondrea&amp;#39;s helm another Andreas he had a</text>
  <text start="4931.34" dur="5.01">paper mill and together these gentlemen</text>
  <text start="4933.65" dur="5.58">collaborated and they built this thing</text>
  <text start="4936.35" dur="3.809">based on the design of the the wine</text>
  <text start="4939.23" dur="3.84">press</text>
  <text start="4940.159" dur="4.381">you know pressing grapes and the reason</text>
  <text start="4943.07" dur="2.55">that this thing came out the way it did</text>
  <text start="4944.54" dur="4.11">is it took</text>
  <text start="4945.62" dur="6.24">oil-based ink instead of water-based ink</text>
  <text start="4948.65" dur="5.55">an oil-based ink lasts longer and the</text>
  <text start="4951.86" dur="3.93">moles were made out of lead meaning you</text>
  <text start="4954.2" dur="3.63">could keep using them again and again</text>
  <text start="4955.79" dur="4.08">and again there were more durable what</text>
  <text start="4957.83" dur="3.93">we take for granted and it&amp;#39;s ubiquitous</text>
  <text start="4959.87" dur="3.96">now because it&amp;#39;s digital we&amp;#39;re passing</text>
  <text start="4961.76" dur="4.41">molecules back in the day that was a big</text>
  <text start="4963.83" dur="3.42">deal and the Bible is what they printed</text>
  <text start="4966.17" dur="4.32">first but then all these other books</text>
  <text start="4967.25" dur="5.34">came along after it so you may have</text>
  <text start="4970.49" dur="4.68">heard of the movement stop bit burning</text>
  <text start="4972.59" dur="4.05">com that&amp;#39;s beyond the scope of this</text>
  <text start="4975.17" dur="2.73">virtual book tour but that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="4976.64" dur="2.4">destined has been involved with I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="4979.04" dur="5.58">moment but let&amp;#39;s go back to our root</text>
  <text start="4981.47" dur="5.79">cause of making this book possible Thank</text>
  <text start="4984.62" dur="4.92">You Gutenberg and thank you for you know</text>
  <text start="4987.26" dur="4.1">the invention probably someone else</text>
  <text start="4989.54" dur="4.62">would have invented it but bottom line</text>
  <text start="4991.36" dur="3.04">you did or you you got acknowledged for</text>
  <text start="4994.16" dur="1.71">it</text>
  <text start="4994.4" dur="3.66">there probably was someone else there</text>
  <text start="4995.87" dur="4.32">who had a lot to do with it</text>
  <text start="4998.06" dur="4.68">like the Thomas Edison Nikola Tesla</text>
  <text start="5000.19" dur="3.93">thing and I&amp;#39;m just very grateful that we</text>
  <text start="5002.74" dur="3.75">get to pass this thing where we pass</text>

  <text start="5052.3" dur="3.24">Dustin can teach you how to do it</text>
  <text start="5053.77" dur="5.22">because he did the first one on his own</text>
  <text start="5055.54" dur="4.77">and I decided to come out of the cracks</text>
  <text start="5058.99" dur="3.6">and do this one right before the new</text>
  <text start="5060.31" dur="5.67">year so it happens to be December 17th</text>

  <text start="5079.63" dur="5.22">any final word Dustin before we go I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="5082.57" dur="4.05">just to clarify I guess bit burning or</text>
  <text start="5084.85" dur="3.27">book burning in the digital sense this</text>
  <text start="5086.62" dur="3.39">is what that means for those who are</text>
  <text start="5088.12" dur="2.96">curious about digital censorship going</text>
  <text start="5090.01" dur="3.9">on now</text>
