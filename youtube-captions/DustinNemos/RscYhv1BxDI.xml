  <text start="160.78" dur="5.039">financial reset from a historical</text>
  <text start="163.47" dur="5.11">academic fundamental and most</text>
  <text start="165.819" dur="5.881">importantly an Intel perspective because</text>
  <text start="168.58" dur="5.67">what&amp;#39;s happening is happening behind the</text>
  <text start="171.7" dur="4.32">scenes that has certainly barely made</text>
  <text start="174.25" dur="3.77">the news and if it&amp;#39;s made the news it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.02" dur="4.77">not made it correctly so we&amp;#39;re here to</text>
  <text start="178.02" dur="4.96">make sense of the madness with regards</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="5.279">to this transition because it is big it</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="6.87">is historic what&amp;#39;s about to take place</text>

  <text start="197.2" dur="5.16">reset and what this means Dustin you</text>
  <text start="200.89" dur="3.83">guys for having me that was quite an</text>
  <text start="202.36" dur="6.06">introduction I hope I can live up to it</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="5.89">you will okay so let me begin</text>
  <text start="208.42" dur="4.62">you know Kirk and I for a couple of</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="4.65">months have been talking about the</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="4.74">global financial reset we&amp;#39;ve defined it</text>
  <text start="215.26" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;ve gone back to the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="5.82">inception and told that story from 1910</text>
  <text start="220.66" dur="4.889">at Jekyll Island forward you know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="223.6" dur="6.109">touched on the various events that are</text>
  <text start="225.549" dur="7.201">unfolding on a daily and weekly basis</text>
  <text start="229.709" dur="5.62">what would you like to contribute to</text>
  <text start="232.75" dur="5.97">this subject about about the stock</text>
  <text start="235.329" dur="5.581">market at 27,000 and the things we see</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="4.97">happening with essential banks the Fed</text>
  <text start="240.91" dur="5.579">and even gold there&amp;#39;s so much to cover</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="4.15">if I were gonna add something to that I</text>
  <text start="246.489" dur="3.84">would be that you have to read between</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="4.53">the lines obviously president Trump and</text>
  <text start="250.329" dur="3.78">the greatest economy ever you know</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s the everything bubble and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.109" dur="3.69">unavoidable it&amp;#39;s not his fault I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="256.06" dur="4.679">want to try to say this is Trump&amp;#39;s fault</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="4.231">but he&amp;#39;s sort of like a an expert pilot</text>
  <text start="260.739" dur="3.211">if you will and he&amp;#39;s got a lot of</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="3.54">experience in business crashing a</text>
  <text start="263.95" dur="4.74">burning plane or trying to land it</text>
  <text start="265.57" dur="4.95">gently I mean he doesn&amp;#39;t have every tool</text>
  <text start="268.69" dur="4.17">to stop what&amp;#39;s coming I mean there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="270.52" dur="4.649">lot of obviously Distortion since as you</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="4.2">said 1913 and the whole central bank</text>
  <text start="275.169" dur="3.841">concept throughout history and we have</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="5.25">to pay the price for the best orsha just</text>
  <text start="279.01" dur="5.64">like we did in o8 but worse however I do</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="4.53">think that he is setting it up to me and</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="5.4">about you know Overton Window shift</text>
  <text start="286.84" dur="4.949">between its the Fed good for the economy</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="4.19">is it good for America or is it the</text>
  <text start="291.789" dur="4.19">enemy and I think that as we go in</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="3.66">2020 is gonna be part of this it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="3.271">be these guys are actually hurting us</text>
  <text start="297.9" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re their parents that are cool</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re there sucking out the economic</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="4.62">lifeblood of our country and our</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="4.95">productive energy in our years and I</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="3.57">think that&amp;#39;s what the big fight is gonna</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="3.09">be about it&amp;#39;s a credibility fight</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="4.08">between Trump and the Fed and I think</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="4.259">he&amp;#39;s already won that fight because they</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="3.87">got the fake news they&amp;#39;re gonna come to</text>
  <text start="315.509" dur="4.59">their defense and no one trusts them so</text>
  <text start="317.61" dur="4.739">the Fed has lost this you know from a</text>
  <text start="320.099" dur="4.051">from a historical economic perspective</text>
  <text start="322.349" dur="3.6">you know we know these things happen</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="3.03">every so often because you know when you</text>
  <text start="325.949" dur="3.511">start to distort and play with the</text>
  <text start="327.18" dur="5.31">markets it creates these you know</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="4.799">unexpected or maybe expected changes and</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="4.109">people can ride those ups and downs</text>
  <text start="334.259" dur="3.361">these boom and bust cycles and they can</text>
  <text start="336.599" dur="3.54">become very very wealthy</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="4.799">obviously by doing that and the people</text>
  <text start="340.139" dur="4.53">who don&amp;#39;t understand inflation they</text>
  <text start="342.419" dur="4.201">don&amp;#39;t understand some of the games that</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="4.821">are played on Wall Street you know</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re just fleeced constantly non-stop</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="5.62">and they have nothing to show for it at</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="4.919">the end of their lives too often except</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="3.54">for pain misery and debt and that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="357.569" dur="3.211">of the system that we&amp;#39;re hopefully</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="4.23">moving out of it will evolve a crash I</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="3.93">think and I&amp;#39;ve talked about that for you</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.379">know over a year now just from the cue</text>
  <text start="364.71" dur="4.34">stuff you know the perspective there</text>
  <text start="367.259" dur="4.021">from Priven Intel perspective is that</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="4.14">behind the scenes it doesn&amp;#39;t look so</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="4.169">good these countries are sort of</text>
  <text start="373.19" dur="3.789">barreling down to the bottom and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="375.449" dur="3.181">race to see who gets there first</text>
  <text start="376.979" dur="3.78">I think gold and silver be the winner</text>
  <text start="378.63" dur="5.009">I&amp;#39;m kind of monopolizing the talk though</text>
  <text start="380.759" dur="4.831">so I&amp;#39;ll take it back you guys no problem</text>
  <text start="383.639" dur="4.65">thanks a lot a lot of great perspectives</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="5.1">I love the analogy he made and a quote</text>
  <text start="388.289" dur="4.35">comes to mind to me by Sun Tzu</text>
  <text start="390.69" dur="3.33">of course they offer from art of war</text>
  <text start="392.639" dur="3.391">when you said you know we&amp;#39;ve already won</text>
  <text start="394.02" dur="3.48">the battle you know he said something</text>
  <text start="396.03" dur="3.81">like this I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing but he said</text>
  <text start="397.5" dur="3.659">great warriors win first and then go to</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="3.84">battle boy oh boy</text>
  <text start="401.159" dur="4.951">that&amp;#39;s exactly the situation with the</text>
  <text start="403.68" dur="5.28">whole the whole D class as well but</text>
  <text start="406.11" dur="4.23">staying on point with the Fed look for</text>
  <text start="408.96" dur="4.23">those that are just joining us or</text>
  <text start="410.34" dur="5.22">perhaps maybe we&amp;#39;re a gradient or two</text>
  <text start="413.19" dur="3.81">above your knowledge base and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="415.56" dur="3.12">mean that disrespectfully but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="417" dur="3.539">coming a lot covering a lot of important</text>
  <text start="418.68" dur="4.019">subjects that really never get spoken</text>
  <text start="420.539" dur="4.531">about the Federal Reserve for those that</text>
  <text start="422.699" dur="4.291">are just joining us along this type of</text>
  <text start="425.07" dur="6.36">subject matter the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="7.32">is a for-profit banking cartel enacted</text>
  <text start="431.43" dur="7.139">into law by Congress in 1913 Woodrow</text>
  <text start="434.31" dur="6.3">Wilson president so became legal but</text>
  <text start="438.569" dur="4.1">still remains unconstitutional because</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="4.41">the Constitution states that only</text>
  <text start="442.669" dur="3.851">Congress shall have the power to issue</text>
  <text start="445.02" dur="3.899">and control the value of our currency</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="4.98">and we gave that away to the Fed and I</text>
  <text start="448.919" dur="4.351">know Dustin and dr. Elliott of course</text>
  <text start="451.5" dur="3.3">know this but I just want to put that</text>
  <text start="453.27" dur="3.42">down for those listening as the</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="3.54">foundation so they simple why me</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="3.9">fighting ourselves we&amp;#39;re not it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="458.34" dur="4.949">ourselves the Federal Reserve is a</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="5.1">for-profit bank and the goal of a</text>
  <text start="463.289" dur="4.47">for-profit bank is to make a profit for</text>
  <text start="465.69" dur="5.759">its shareholders if you will and boy are</text>
  <text start="467.759" dur="5.011">they making a profit dr. Elliott what</text>
  <text start="471.449" dur="5.071">said what some of your views with</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="5.489">regards to this parallel sort of game</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s that Dustin alluded to in a</text>
  <text start="478.259" dur="7.521">moment ago where you know we&amp;#39;re heading</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="8.04">for a crash while Trump is kind of</text>
  <text start="485.78" dur="5.53">reading the global landscape and setting</text>
  <text start="488.97" dur="5.25">things up for where we&amp;#39;re heading which</text>
  <text start="491.31" dur="5.28">is restoring power back to the people by</text>
  <text start="494.22" dur="4.35">snoring sound money in part but at the</text>
  <text start="496.59" dur="4.639">same time playing in the rigged system</text>
  <text start="498.57" dur="5.069">to keep the markets intact</text>
  <text start="501.229" dur="4.961">how could you weigh in on these various</text>
  <text start="503.639" dur="5.191">points Kirk economist dr. Kirk Elliott</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="5.969">well you know really really good thanks</text>
  <text start="508.83" dur="5.069">John and and Dustin I loved your your</text>
  <text start="512.159" dur="4.68">comments there at the beginning you know</text>
  <text start="513.899" dur="4.89">makes makes me think of you know Trump</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="6.211">is the first president in a long time</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="6.091">who who believes that that he is there</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="3.36">for the people right rather than the</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="3.6">people that are there for the government</text>
  <text start="526.41" dur="6.63">you know it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a shift and and</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="7.14">what he&amp;#39;s doing is is when you said it</text>
  <text start="533.04" dur="5.94">be that the Fed is the enemy right and</text>
  <text start="535.62" dur="6.63">that&amp;#39;s the table that he&amp;#39;s setting it</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="5.19">just a couple of weeks ago I remember a</text>
  <text start="542.25" dur="5.1">tweet that he sent out where he</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="5.37">basically said I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing but he</text>
  <text start="547.35" dur="5.7">was wondering if Jerome Powell Fed</text>
  <text start="549.54" dur="5.7">Chairman that he hand-picked or the</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="4.529">communist communist leader of China is</text>
  <text start="555.24" dur="5.039">America&amp;#39;s bigger enemy it&amp;#39;s like you</text>
  <text start="557.579" dur="5.521">know so so the gauntlet is</text>
  <text start="560.279" dur="6.031">is is out there right and and so but but</text>
  <text start="563.1" dur="6.57">you looked at what Trump is doing um you</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="4.889">look at you know the interest rates</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="4.409">I mean he&amp;#39;s making America great again</text>
  <text start="571.199" dur="5.19">right he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s holding true to that his</text>
  <text start="574.079" dur="5.25">campaign promises which most presidents</text>
  <text start="576.389" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t well how is he doing that well you</text>
  <text start="579.329" dur="4.021">know we John and I have talked a lot and</text>
  <text start="581.519" dur="4.771">and you know I&amp;#39;ve read a lot of your</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="5.669">material well a weak dollar means that</text>
  <text start="586.29" dur="5.13">American exports are going to be cheaper</text>
  <text start="589.019" dur="4.68">all over the world because comparatively</text>
  <text start="591.42" dur="3.899">speaking other countries currencies are</text>
  <text start="593.699" dur="4.231">stronger it takes fewer of them to buy</text>

  <text start="1065.52" dur="7.53">different is this is global and this has</text>
  <text start="1069.36" dur="6.93">been going on long before 1913 this</text>
  <text start="1073.05" dur="5.91">dynasty if you will and so this is going</text>

  <text start="1078.96" dur="3.99">think you&amp;#39;re right there is going to be</text>
  <text start="1080.7" dur="3.72">some hiccups I also believe that thank</text>
  <text start="1082.95" dur="3.39">goodness President Trump is in there</text>

  <text start="1134.409" dur="4.531">and I&amp;#39;m sorry Kirk and I discussed this</text>
  <text start="1136.09" dur="5.13">the other day in a program but my take</text>
  <text start="1138.94" dur="4.559">on the Saudi Arabia oil field thing is</text>
  <text start="1141.22" dur="5.789">look fingers are pointing to Iran seems</text>
  <text start="1143.499" dur="7.071">plausible it seems is a desperate deep</text>
  <text start="1147.009" dur="6.03">state move for two reasons number one</text>
  <text start="1150.57" dur="3.88">try and spike oil but I think they</text>
  <text start="1153.039" dur="4.801">didn&amp;#39;t realize that we&amp;#39;re the number one</text>
  <text start="1154.45" dur="7.709">producer of oil now so we&amp;#39;re not so much</text>
  <text start="1157.84" dur="7.37">in dire straits number two was also of</text>
  <text start="1162.159" dur="6.12">course to try and drag Trump into war</text>
  <text start="1165.21" dur="6.13">which he&amp;#39;ll heal outsmarting them on</text>
  <text start="1168.279" dur="5.431">both counts Kirk we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="1171.34" dur="5.88">Fed here and these sorts of things and</text>
  <text start="1173.71" dur="6.63">we can Dustin mentioned gold and and and</text>
  <text start="1177.22" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s its place in restoring sound money</text>
  <text start="1180.34" dur="5.819">you know q and on has told us that gold</text>
  <text start="1182.83" dur="5.339">exposes and destroys the Fed so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1186.159" dur="4.321">it what&amp;#39;s your analysis on that how kirk</text>
  <text start="1188.169" dur="7.321">why why would gold expose and destroy</text>
  <text start="1190.48" dur="8.669">the Fed well you know you you keep using</text>
  <text start="1195.49" dur="5.549">the phrase restoring sound money that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1199.149" dur="3.571">that&amp;#39;s actually what gold and silver</text>
  <text start="1201.039" dur="3.931">ours they&amp;#39;ve been sound money since the</text>
  <text start="1202.72" dur="4.529">beginning of time you know currencies</text>
  <text start="1204.97" dur="3.72">come and go especially fiat currencies</text>
  <text start="1207.249" dur="4.711">where they&amp;#39;re just issued by government</text>
  <text start="1208.69" dur="4.89">Fiat there&amp;#39;s nothing backing them you</text>
  <text start="1211.96" dur="4.26">know we we used to have a gold standard</text>
  <text start="1213.58" dur="5.039">in America we used you know it we</text>
  <text start="1216.22" dur="4.679">completely got off of that and in the</text>
  <text start="1218.619" dur="4.981">Nixon administration you know got off of</text>
  <text start="1220.899" dur="4.801">that partially before with with you know</text>
  <text start="1223.6" dur="3.93">the Federal Reserve System and so forth</text>
  <text start="1225.7" dur="4.62">but when you</text>
  <text start="1227.53" dur="4.77">have no tangible backing behind a</text>
  <text start="1230.32" dur="3.51">currency then government officials can</text>
  <text start="1232.3" dur="2.85">just print without discretion if they</text>
  <text start="1233.83" dur="2.85">need money they just still hit the red</text>
  <text start="1235.15" dur="3.78">button on the printing press and boom</text>
  <text start="1236.68" dur="5.04">they have month but what that does over</text>
  <text start="1238.93" dur="4.59">time is is it creates any currency that</text>
  <text start="1241.72" dur="6.42">does that it turns it into monopoly</text>
  <text start="1243.52" dur="7.86">money ultimately it has no value so so</text>
  <text start="1248.14" dur="6.51">throughout the history of the world gold</text>
  <text start="1251.38" dur="7.23">and silver but primarily gold has been</text>
  <text start="1254.65" dur="5.67">the de facto real currency that even</text>
  <text start="1258.61" dur="3.72">kings and kingdoms you know have fought</text>
  <text start="1260.32" dur="5.01">over you know even going back to</text>
  <text start="1262.33" dur="8.04">biblical times right so so if you look</text>
  <text start="1265.33" dur="7.32">at the modern day you know people saying</text>
  <text start="1270.37" dur="3.99">what what is going to replace this</text>
  <text start="1272.65" dur="4.08">currency system that we have right now</text>
  <text start="1274.36" dur="4.83">well you could look at people like Jim</text>
  <text start="1276.73" dur="4.71">Rickards who thinks it&amp;#39;s gonna be an IMF</text>
  <text start="1279.19" dur="6.12">Special Drawing right kind of basket of</text>
  <text start="1281.44" dur="7.46">currencies yeah we we already have that</text>
  <text start="1285.31" dur="5.94">and and people don&amp;#39;t necessarily trust</text>
  <text start="1288.9" dur="4.63">government anymore when they just print</text>
  <text start="1291.25" dur="4.2">money by Fiat because they see what</text>
  <text start="1293.53" dur="5.64">happens it creates boom and bust cycles</text>
  <text start="1295.45" dur="7.5">it creates imbalances you could have</text>
  <text start="1299.17" dur="6.72">another world reserve currency which the</text>
  <text start="1302.95" dur="7.79">US has been you know since Bretton Woods</text>
  <text start="1305.89" dur="7.41">prior to that it was it was you know the</text>
  <text start="1310.74" dur="4.8">Britain you know they had the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1313.3" dur="4.68">reserve currency prior to that it was</text>
  <text start="1315.54" dur="4.99">Greece prior to that it was the Dutch</text>
  <text start="1317.98" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s like oh my word you know global</text>
  <text start="1320.53" dur="5.43">reserve currencies go away people lose</text>
  <text start="1322.78" dur="5.43">their spot in the Sun and they lose all</text>
  <text start="1325.96" dur="4.83">public interest in it so it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="1328.21" dur="5.07">be that the euro was the poster child</text>
  <text start="1330.79" dur="3.75">for a regionally integrated currency</text>
  <text start="1333.28" dur="2.84">well that doesn&amp;#39;t work because people</text>
  <text start="1334.54" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t like to give up their sovereignty</text>
  <text start="1336.12" dur="5.29">so so really they&amp;#39;ve tried everything</text>
  <text start="1339.19" dur="4.92">and what&amp;#39;s left</text>
  <text start="1341.41" dur="6.09">gold and silver it&amp;#39;s the only thing that</text>
  <text start="1344.11" dur="6.24">the Fed doesn&amp;#39;t want because the more</text>
  <text start="1347.5" dur="5.22">gold and silver go up in value the less</text>
  <text start="1350.35" dur="4.23">demand there is for paper fiat</text>
  <text start="1352.72" dur="5.64">currencies that are printed without</text>
  <text start="1354.58" dur="5.14">discretion so so in the end I think what</text>
  <text start="1358.36" dur="3.34">is going to win out</text>
  <text start="1359.72" dur="3.839">you know with all of the arguments with</text>
  <text start="1361.7" dur="4.08">everybody that&amp;#39;s saying what they think</text>
  <text start="1363.559" dur="4.411">it&amp;#39;s gonna be I truly do think it is</text>
  <text start="1365.78" dur="4.29">going to be a gold and silver backed</text>
  <text start="1367.97" dur="5.1">currency because it&amp;#39;s the only thing</text>
  <text start="1370.07" dur="5.91">that has tangible value it&amp;#39;s a scarce</text>
  <text start="1373.07" dur="5.849">resource and and people are just sick</text>
  <text start="1375.98" dur="5.069">and tired of of the status quo they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1378.919" dur="2.49">sick and tired of governments lying to</text>
  <text start="1381.049" dur="1.891">them</text>
  <text start="1381.409" dur="3.091">look this is that this is the whole</text>
  <text start="1382.94" dur="4.17">populist movement right this is how</text>
  <text start="1384.5" dur="5.039">Trump got elected this is how brexit</text>
  <text start="1387.11" dur="4.799">happened it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s this move of we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1389.539" dur="4.801">trust the globalist anymore we want to</text>
  <text start="1391.909" dur="6.301">be more independent we want there to be</text>
  <text start="1394.34" dur="6.329">realness behind our currency and behind</text>
  <text start="1398.21" dur="4.949">our countries and we want things to have</text>
  <text start="1400.669" dur="6.271">meaning this is what the world is</text>
  <text start="1403.159" dur="5.791">searching for and gold as a as a backing</text>
  <text start="1406.94" dur="4.979">for currency is the only thing in my</text>
  <text start="1408.95" dur="5.76">opinion that makes sense just my opinion</text>
  <text start="1411.919" dur="4.321">but but I do have PhD at this stuff and</text>
  <text start="1414.71" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s like okay this is this is what I</text>
  <text start="1416.24" dur="5.73">believe well you talked about gold being</text>

  <text start="1421.97" dur="4.86">the days of Kings 6,000 years worth of</text>
  <text start="1424.49" dur="4.47">history which is why it&amp;#39;s no surprise</text>
  <text start="1426.83" dur="4.589">you hear the expression all these years</text>
  <text start="1428.96" dur="4.62">later any generation listening to this</text>
  <text start="1431.419" dur="4.62">program right now has all used or heard</text>
  <text start="1433.58" dur="4.579">this expression hey that&amp;#39;s as good as</text>
  <text start="1436.039" dur="7.201">gold there&amp;#39;s a reason they say that</text>
  <text start="1438.159" dur="7.571">because gold gold has value for many</text>
  <text start="1443.24" dur="4.41">many years and to back up just a little</text>
  <text start="1445.73" dur="5.67">bit sort of a thirty thousand view for</text>
  <text start="1447.65" dur="7.5">our listeners here prior to the arrival</text>
  <text start="1451.4" dur="7.29">of Donald Trump the globalist agenda was</text>
  <text start="1455.15" dur="5.7">well in motion meaning they would Dori</text>
  <text start="1458.69" dur="4.08">took down Europe as you alluded to dr.</text>

  <text start="1468.38" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t work but then they were going</text>
  <text start="1470.6" dur="4.709">after the u.s. it was supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1472.4" dur="5.22">Canada u.s. and Mexico the Amero and the</text>

  <text start="1479.87" dur="5.76">as reported by Lou Dobbs many years ago</text>
  <text start="1481.88" dur="5.4">as well but so where we were headed was</text>
  <text start="1485.63" dur="4.32">that bringing down the Western world</text>
  <text start="1487.28" dur="4.2">shifting the power from America as the</text>
  <text start="1489.95" dur="3.51">world&amp;#39;s reserve in the world</text>
  <text start="1491.48" dur="3.54">power center bringing us to third-world</text>
  <text start="1493.46" dur="4.05">status Thank You Clinton Bush and</text>
  <text start="1495.02" dur="7.71">particularly Obama and then they were</text>
  <text start="1497.51" dur="6.66">going to make China they they we define</text>
  <text start="1502.73" dur="3.39">in my book Trump in the resurrection</text>
  <text start="1504.17" dur="3.84">they the globalist the ruling elite</text>
  <text start="1506.12" dur="5.63">you know the structures that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1508.01" dur="6.48">covered before the central bankers they</text>
  <text start="1511.75" dur="6.48">wanted China now to have that power</text>
  <text start="1514.49" dur="7.02">which is why they gave IMF granted China</text>
  <text start="1518.23" dur="5.71">SDR Special Drawing rights backing and</text>
  <text start="1521.51" dur="4.86">protection to boost global confidence in</text>

  <text start="1526.37" dur="4.89">set for the Western world have come down</text>
  <text start="1529.19" dur="3.69">and we were getting hit really hard we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1531.26" dur="3.99">be on our knees now foreign for Trump</text>
  <text start="1532.88" dur="4.17">and and then they were gonna bolster</text>
  <text start="1535.25" dur="3.84">China to be the new big guy on the</text>
  <text start="1537.05" dur="4.23">street and use that country in that way</text>
  <text start="1539.09" dur="4.56">at least that&amp;#39;s the way I analyzed it</text>
  <text start="1541.28" dur="5.13">and then of course the unlikely</text>
  <text start="1543.65" dur="5.04">candidate the unlikely president stepped</text>
  <text start="1546.41" dur="4.29">up and changed everything it&amp;#39;s a massive</text>
  <text start="1548.69" dur="5.04">paradigm shift and I hope everyone</text>
  <text start="1550.7" dur="5.1">listening realizes what this president</text>
  <text start="1553.73" dur="4.89">is doing right now what he is up against</text>
  <text start="1555.8" dur="6.51">and how this is really an amazing time</text>
  <text start="1558.62" dur="5.31">to be alive but yeah so let&amp;#39;s see where</text>
  <text start="1562.31" dur="4.14">else I wanted to go with this you know</text>
  <text start="1563.93" dur="4.74">and turn it over to Dustin&amp;#39;s abuse but</text>
  <text start="1566.45" dur="4.41">uh I look at what Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="1568.67" dur="6.54">now three broad for a very broad thing</text>
  <text start="1570.86" dur="6.66">again thirty thousand mile view one he</text>
  <text start="1575.21" dur="3.51">was just making America great again if</text>
  <text start="1577.52" dur="3.24">you look at the first two and a half</text>

  <text start="1588.89" dur="4.08">promises kept calm and you&amp;#39;ll find out</text>
  <text start="1590.93" dur="4.08">the incredible things he&amp;#39;s accomplished</text>
  <text start="1592.97" dur="3.48">but now that it&amp;#39;s been proven to be a</text>
  <text start="1595.01" dur="4.98">witch hunt there&amp;#39;s three broad things</text>

  <text start="1606.23" dur="5.43">what President Trump is doing is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1608.66" dur="5.67">reaching the federal judges almost two</text>

  <text start="1665.72" dur="4.11">kind of like the globalists and such I</text>
  <text start="1668.03" dur="4.7">wanted to be very clear to people that</text>
  <text start="1669.83" dur="4.98">gold is our best protection from them</text>

  <text start="2532.82" dur="3.24">up to 50 and they crash them back down</text>
  <text start="2534.5" dur="4.05">because they want to keep that price</text>
  <text start="2536.06" dur="4.05">with the ETF&amp;#39;s as you were talking about</text>
  <text start="2538.55" dur="4.26">it clear they want to keep the price</text>

  <text start="2797.51" dur="4.83">receive a free global financial reset</text>
  <text start="2799.52" dur="4.8">report which includes 18 pages of</text>
  <text start="2802.34" dur="4.8">everything you need to understand about</text>
  <text start="2804.32" dur="4.71">gold and silver how it&amp;#39;s priced how not</text>
  <text start="2807.14" dur="4.17">to get ripped off what gold the civil</text>
  <text start="2809.03" dur="5.37">ratio is best to buy what our bullion</text>
  <text start="2811.31" dur="5.549">versus semi numismatic wittiest story</text>
  <text start="2814.4" dur="4.5">you know all of these issues are covered</text>
  <text start="2816.859" dur="4.381">in there but Kirk I know you probably</text>
  <text start="2818.9" dur="4.17">want to just chime in a little bit with</text>
  <text start="2821.24" dur="2.55">regard to the importance of silver</text>
  <text start="2823.07" dur="4.5">because I agree with</text>
  <text start="2823.79" dur="6.33">dusting completely yeah I mean I you</text>
  <text start="2827.57" dur="5.61">know personally I I don&amp;#39;t care I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="2830.12" dur="5.37">gold guy I&amp;#39;m not a silver guy what what</text>
  <text start="2833.18" dur="3.75">do the ratios tell us is is the best</text>
  <text start="2835.49" dur="3.12">thing to buy I mean that&amp;#39;s how we can</text>
  <text start="2836.93" dur="4.59">maximize our return and minimize our</text>
  <text start="2838.61" dur="5.31">risk well you know Dustin&amp;#39;s numbers are</text>
  <text start="2841.52" dur="5.22">absolutely spot-on accurate the average</text>
  <text start="2843.92" dur="4.59">you know how many ounces of silver does</text>
  <text start="2846.74" dur="5.55">it take to buy one ounce of gold or time</text>
  <text start="2848.51" dur="6.45">20 well when we&amp;#39;re like 80 right now you</text>
  <text start="2852.29" dur="5.37">know so that that average will act as a</text>
  <text start="2854.96" dur="6.21">magnet so when the when the ratio is</text>
  <text start="2857.66" dur="5.55">high right now it says buy silver don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2861.17" dur="4.38">buy as much gold when we&amp;#39;re down near</text>
  <text start="2863.21" dur="4.68">the 20 range that rachel says buy more</text>
  <text start="2865.55" dur="5.01">gold and buy less silver because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2867.89" dur="5.73">at that historical top and bottom end of</text>
  <text start="2870.56" dur="5.22">the averages so here&amp;#39;s the thing in</text>
  <text start="2873.62" dur="5.04">strategy I&amp;#39;ve been using with people for</text>
  <text start="2875.78" dur="5.37">decades is you know what at today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2878.66" dur="4.74">price when that that ratio is gonna come</text>
  <text start="2881.15" dur="5.64">down which means one of two things</text>
  <text start="2883.4" dur="6.09">it means gold is overvalued or silver is</text>
  <text start="2886.79" dur="4.32">undervalued but Gold&amp;#39;s not overvalued</text>
  <text start="2889.49" dur="3.6">with everything that we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="2891.11" dur="3.66">about Gold is gonna go up so what does</text>
  <text start="2893.09" dur="3.93">that mean for silver it&amp;#39;s got some</text>
  <text start="2894.77" dur="5.88">ketchup to do it is gonna outperform</text>
  <text start="2897.02" dur="6.72">gold so when we&amp;#39;re at 80 to 1 and we go</text>
  <text start="2900.65" dur="5.61">down to 40 to 1 what did you just do if</text>
  <text start="2903.74" dur="4.17">you bought silver well you could</text>
  <text start="2906.26" dur="3.18">actually trade in your silver and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2907.91" dur="2.88">just exchange it for gold you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2909.44" dur="3.15">to pay anymore you already bought this</text>
  <text start="2910.79" dur="3.78">stuff and you could get double the</text>
  <text start="2912.59" dur="4.56">amount of ounces of gold that you could</text>
  <text start="2914.57" dur="5.19">have purchased today what if it gets</text>
  <text start="2917.15" dur="4.98">down to 2 then 20 to 1 you could do the</text>
  <text start="2919.76" dur="5.13">same thing and double again it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2922.13" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s a compounding way to measure your</text>
  <text start="2924.89" dur="4.5">wealth in number of ounces that you own</text>
  <text start="2927.41" dur="3.99">and then you just work it in the</text>
  <text start="2929.39" dur="4.74">flip-flop but when the ratio start going</text>
  <text start="2931.4" dur="4.98">up again so it&amp;#39;s so truly you know I</text>
  <text start="2934.13" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t like leverage I don&amp;#39;t like margin</text>
  <text start="2936.38" dur="4.32">and I just like buying what you buy so</text>
  <text start="2939.08" dur="3.27">you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2940.7" dur="3.9">like futures because there&amp;#39;s a timeout</text>
  <text start="2942.35" dur="4.86">there and we don&amp;#39;t control anything</text>
  <text start="2944.6" dur="4.29">right so so but when you&amp;#39;re on the right</text>
  <text start="2947.21" dur="3.54">side of the trend and that trend is your</text>
  <text start="2948.89" dur="3.38">friend you can take advantage of it so</text>
  <text start="2950.75" dur="5.64">it doesn&amp;#39;t take advantage of you</text>
  <text start="2952.27" dur="5.33">therefore buy silver in time we can</text>
  <text start="2956.39" dur="3.67">actually get you free</text>
  <text start="2957.6" dur="5.64">bounces of gold down the road and just</text>
  <text start="2960.06" dur="6.45">keep compounding your wealth and measure</text>
  <text start="2963.24" dur="5.73">your wealth not buy-in what the things</text>
  <text start="2966.51" dur="4.35">that you own not buy how many paper</text>
  <text start="2968.97" dur="4.02">dollars that you have because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2970.86" dur="4.65">meaningless it could collapse overnight</text>
  <text start="2972.99" dur="6.36">gold and silver have never gone to zero</text>
  <text start="2975.51" dur="6.21">ever ever I would like to ask your</text>
  <text start="2979.35" dur="4.23">thought on something you know the seesaw</text>
  <text start="2981.72" dur="4.83">is from like the plate on straight</text>
  <text start="2983.58" dur="5.46">mm-hmm now is it appropriate to</text>
  <text start="2986.55" dur="5.37">visualize sort of the the I guess the</text>
  <text start="2989.04" dur="4.41">power dynamic the central bank has all</text>
  <text start="2991.92" dur="3.9">the weight right now have all the power</text>
  <text start="2993.45" dur="4.14">but for every person that&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="2995.82" dur="2.91">committed and understands the concept</text>
  <text start="2997.59" dur="3.09">you&amp;#39;re talking about with gold and</text>
  <text start="2998.73" dur="4.92">silver astounding money that starts to</text>
  <text start="3000.68" dur="4.92">swing like the it starts to counter</text>
  <text start="3003.65" dur="3.27">their power and eventually we can</text>
  <text start="3005.6" dur="3.09">actually take the central bank power</text>
  <text start="3006.92" dur="3.36">down to almost nothing because no one</text>
  <text start="3008.69" dur="3.54">trust there and that happens when the</text>
  <text start="3010.28" dur="4.19">trust falls apart cause issues paper and</text>
  <text start="3012.23" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s where we have the best sort of</text>
  <text start="3014.47" dur="4.81">mankind the best sort of experience that</text>
  <text start="3016.97" dur="4.56">sorry my dog&amp;#39;s the best the best</text>
  <text start="3019.28" dur="4.16">opportunities for freedom for for</text>
  <text start="3021.53" dur="5.58">maximizing happiness and prosperity</text>
  <text start="3023.44" dur="6.16">safety security patrol norms just every</text>
  <text start="3027.11" dur="3.87">single thing is benefited by this this</text>
  <text start="3029.6" dur="4.86">thing that touches everything which is</text>
  <text start="3030.98" dur="5.82">money that&amp;#39;s a great visual dustin and</text>
  <text start="3034.46" dur="5.85">that&amp;#39;s a very appropriate way to look at</text>
  <text start="3036.8" dur="5.4">it you know you you could say you know</text>
  <text start="3040.31" dur="3.75">when there&amp;#39;s a war going on and the</text>
  <text start="3042.2" dur="4.26">invading army is way out in the middle</text>
  <text start="3044.06" dur="5.49">of the desert someplace nobody gives a</text>
  <text start="3046.46" dur="4.89">flip right but when that enemy is right</text>
  <text start="3049.55" dur="4.74">at the gates of the city that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="3051.35" dur="5.13">war intensifies the most so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3054.29" dur="4.74">seeing in your seesaw analogy is that</text>
  <text start="3056.48" dur="4.67">seesaw is starting to balance out that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3059.03" dur="5.64">why the war is starting to get more</text>
  <text start="3061.15" dur="7.27">apparent and in our face every day the</text>
  <text start="3064.67" dur="7.29">moment were it even even its all-out war</text>
  <text start="3068.42" dur="7.02">because the next win changes the balance</text>
  <text start="3071.96" dur="6.09">of power and so as as more people buy</text>
  <text start="3075.44" dur="5.37">gold and silver it is a slap in the face</text>
  <text start="3078.05" dur="5.82">against the current monetary financial</text>
  <text start="3080.81" dur="6.27">system which was intended by the central</text>
  <text start="3083.87" dur="6.75">bankers to bring stability to monetary</text>
  <text start="3087.08" dur="4.12">policy it does everything but stability</text>
  <text start="3090.62" dur="2.62">because</text>
  <text start="3091.2" dur="4.68">it creates boom-and-bust cycles when you</text>
  <text start="3093.24" dur="5.04">have no tangible backing to it so what</text>
  <text start="3095.88" dur="4.14">they intended is completely opposite and</text>
  <text start="3098.28" dur="4.29">you know what they knew that from the</text>
  <text start="3100.02" dur="4.65">beginning those were not stupid guys</text>
  <text start="3102.57" dur="4.62">that put this together they knew that</text>
  <text start="3104.67" dur="4.23">from the beginning but when you control</text>
  <text start="3107.19" dur="5.07">the money that&amp;#39;s power</text>
  <text start="3108.9" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s control and its wealth for them and</text>
  <text start="3112.26" dur="4.17">so that was the ultimate goal they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3114.63" dur="3.63">starting to lose that because people</text>
  <text start="3116.43" dur="5.37">have figured out what their game is and</text>
  <text start="3118.26" dur="6.27">I think pretty soon I mean I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="3121.8" dur="4.83">be a forecaster of time because who</text>
  <text start="3124.53" dur="4.35">knows but pretty soon you see that</text>
  <text start="3126.63" dur="5.52">seesaw balance out and it does go in the</text>
  <text start="3128.88" dur="7.38">other direction mmm Kirk you mentioned</text>
  <text start="3132.15" dur="5.52">booms and busts being created I talked</text>
  <text start="3136.26" dur="4.05">about this before but it&amp;#39;s worth</text>
  <text start="3137.67" dur="4.08">mentioning as applicable to that Charles</text>

  <text start="3708.54" dur="6.15">guys are talking about has never really</text>
  <text start="3710.25" dur="7.44">happened before but so it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="3714.69" dur="5.85">happen to me right normalcy bias things</text>
  <text start="3717.69" dur="7.02">are changing the global financial</text>
  <text start="3720.54" dur="6.84">landscape is changing and we simply need</text>
  <text start="3724.71" dur="6">to act I mean one thing that we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3727.38" dur="5.13">cover but it&amp;#39;s a huge deal huge deal you</text>
  <text start="3730.71" dur="3.84">know we&amp;#39;ve talked about the global</text>
  <text start="3732.51" dur="4.26">financial reset you know what&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="3734.55" dur="5.13">happen here in America pretty soon is is</text>
  <text start="3736.77" dur="6.03">the state pension funds are like a Ponzi</text>
  <text start="3739.68" dur="6.24">scheme why their internal rate of return</text>
  <text start="3742.8" dur="4.52">is is set at a number that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3745.92" dur="4.55">unsustainable because</text>
  <text start="3747.32" dur="5.28">80% normally of of state pensions or in</text>
  <text start="3750.47" dur="3.9">bonds the interest rates are so low and</text>
  <text start="3752.6" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re gonna stay so low for so long</text>
  <text start="3754.37" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s impossible for them to maintain</text>
  <text start="3757.52" dur="4.41">in the future now we&amp;#39;re at a point now</text>
  <text start="3759.5" dur="3.93">where all of these state workers where</text>
  <text start="3761.93" dur="3.75">all the way state employees anybody</text>
  <text start="3763.43" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s on a pension there&amp;#39;s more people</text>
  <text start="3765.68" dur="5.37">in retirement than there are active</text>
  <text start="3768.08" dur="4.44">workers you can&amp;#39;t continue to pay their</text>
  <text start="3771.05" dur="3.99">people in retirement when there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="3772.52" dur="6.12">of them with fewer active workers it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3775.04" dur="6.6">destined to fail so here&amp;#39;s where I think</text>
  <text start="3778.64" dur="6.15">in America a big big looming crisis</text>
  <text start="3781.64" dur="5.67">coming down the road maybe even in some</text>
  <text start="3784.79" dur="5.25">states before a global financial reset</text>
  <text start="3787.31" dur="6.09">happens is a state pension crisis I mean</text>
  <text start="3790.04" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;ve got to identify these trends so we</text>
  <text start="3793.4" dur="6.06">can act don&amp;#39;t stick your head in the</text>
  <text start="3796.43" dur="5.01">sand and be afraid that if you do that</text>
  <text start="3799.46" dur="3.69">well then you should be afraid but if</text>
  <text start="3801.44" dur="3.57">you there are things that you can do</text>
  <text start="3803.15" dur="4.47">this is what I want to end with there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3805.01" dur="4.89">hope in the message that John and Dustin</text>
  <text start="3807.62" dur="4.41">and I are saying there&amp;#39;s hope because</text>
  <text start="3809.9" dur="4.74">when we understand what the outcome is</text>
  <text start="3812.03" dur="4.44">going to be we can act accordingly so</text>
  <text start="3814.64" dur="4.05">that doesn&amp;#39;t affect us as much and so</text>
  <text start="3816.47" dur="3.87">take advantage of the situation take</text>
  <text start="3818.69" dur="4.23">advantage of the trends so the trends</text>
  <text start="3820.34" dur="5.73">don&amp;#39;t take advantage of you and and boom</text>
  <text start="3822.92" dur="4.47">your retirement could be as amazing as</text>
  <text start="3826.07" dur="3.33">you thought it was gonna be when you</text>
  <text start="3827.39" dur="4.32">first started working when you were 20</text>
  <text start="3829.4" dur="5.16">right so so you know that&amp;#39;s kind of what</text>
  <text start="3831.71" dur="5.16">I want to leave you with is is act don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3834.56" dur="4.17">be afraid just because the world around</text>
  <text start="3836.87" dur="4.26">us is scary doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you have</text>
  <text start="3838.73" dur="4.41">to act out in fear and do nothing just</text>
  <text start="3841.13" dur="3.62">do something about it and you can make</text>
