  <text start="3.36" dur="4.47">wait for the video to start and then</text>
  <text start="5.31" dur="5.94">choose to go pee just a suspicion I</text>
  <text start="7.83" dur="5.46">can&amp;#39;t confirm it but hey so moving on</text>
  <text start="11.25" dur="4.07">Giuliani is actually saying that Trump</text>
  <text start="13.29" dur="4.86">may block the release of Mueller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="15.32" dur="4.39">report with basically executive</text>
  <text start="18.15" dur="2.549">privilege you know they he could have</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="3">started this right at the beginning</text>
  <text start="20.699" dur="5.611">chose not to Obama did it things like</text>
  <text start="22.71" dur="6.93">that but I suspect that this is more of</text>
  <text start="26.31" dur="7.589">a spur for the Democrats like this is</text>
  <text start="29.64" dur="6.03">more of a MSM you know he&amp;#39;s goading them</text>
  <text start="33.899" dur="4.141">right this is gonna spur them to more</text>
  <text start="35.67" dur="3.389">hair-pulling and more outrageous cries</text>
  <text start="38.04" dur="2.85">of blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="4.291">tyranny this tyranny that and then he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="40.89" dur="5.46">just backed out writer later because he</text>
  <text start="43.35" dur="5.01">he set them up to basically jump to his</text>
  <text start="46.35" dur="3.42">tune right like he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s controlling</text>
  <text start="48.36" dur="5.19">the narrative and they&amp;#39;re just kind of</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="5.28">dancing to his his control because why</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="3.689">would he do this like he doesn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="3.45">he&amp;#39;s obviously quite innocent that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="57.239" dur="4.531">the evidence points that the other</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="4.5">people like Hillary and the people</text>
  <text start="61.77" dur="4.02">investigating him they&amp;#39;re all very</text>
  <text start="63" dur="4.77">guilty so why then pretend like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="3.66">gonna block the the information of</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="3.12">coming out well because you want to</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="4.2">control the narrative because you want</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="5.04">to keep them focused on stupid things</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="5.399">and and freaking out over stupid things</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="4.71">while you focus on actual like you know</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="3.481">the actual war that&amp;#39;s going on the</text>
  <text start="80.64" dur="4.049">actual strategy that&amp;#39;s going on they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="82.53" dur="5.33">over here dancing days tune and what</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="5.371">else can they do at this point right</text>
  <text start="87.86" dur="5.23">where were we</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="5.61">mattis is basically behind it looks like</text>
  <text start="93.09" dur="4.169">300 million in funding to Pakistan which</text>
  <text start="95.67" dur="4.019">was suspended but is just now</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="4.11">permanently cut it in that great 300</text>
  <text start="99.689" dur="5.011">million of our dollars no longer taken</text>
  <text start="101.369" dur="4.651">for Pakistan they&amp;#39;re still taken they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="3.62">still taxed but you know at least</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="7.379">they&amp;#39;ll be kept in the US hopefully</text>
  <text start="108.32" dur="8.799">let&amp;#39;s see we&amp;#39;ll see Jack Dorsey over at</text>
  <text start="113.399" dur="5.61">the Twitter CEO guy he is now saying</text>
  <text start="117.119" dur="4.261">that some of the overzealous shadow</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="4.801">banning was a mistake conveniently three</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="6.659">to three days before Congress grills him</text>
  <text start="123.81" dur="6.75">and it&amp;#39;s interesting that also kind of</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="5.071">on the other side of that flip coin</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="3.1">there other Twitter employees that are</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="2.17">high level</text>
  <text start="133.66" dur="3.63">saying that you know Trump is not above</text>
  <text start="135.28" dur="3.24">being kicked off Twitter so I I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="137.29" dur="5.31">know what they&amp;#39;re trying to do here I</text>
  <text start="138.52" dur="6.69">mean it just recently came out from</text>
  <text start="142.6" dur="3.99">Trump&amp;#39;s the campaign manager for 2020 I</text>
  <text start="145.21" dur="3.45">meant I mentioned this last time I did a</text>
  <text start="146.59" dur="4.83">video on the news yesterday or day</text>
  <text start="148.66" dur="4.44">before Brad parse kale was basically</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="3.3">saying like you know if Trump left</text>
  <text start="153.1" dur="3.69">Twitter for an alternate platform they</text>
  <text start="154.72" dur="3.72">would be dead and they would be dead and</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="4.23">that would be amazing and I think that</text>
  <text start="158.44" dur="4.62">that is definitely gonna happen I think</text>
  <text start="161.02" dur="6.33">that&amp;#39;s a wonderful strategy move and I</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="5.76">think that in doing so Trump cannot be</text>
  <text start="167.35" dur="2.76">called a tyrant because he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="168.82" dur="6.63">exercising his freedom of association</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="7.2">and he can then implode Twitter which</text>
  <text start="175.45" dur="4.29">would of course affect you know the</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="5.13">whole the whole mass exodus from Twitter</text>
  <text start="179.74" dur="4.5">would also affect Facebook somewhat</text>
  <text start="182.44" dur="4.53">somewhat even Google and YouTube but</text>
  <text start="184.24" dur="5.42">mainly Facebook and Twitter I mean the</text>
  <text start="186.97" dur="5.91">the big social media Giants boom</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="6.28">overnight people would flock the gap in</text>
  <text start="192.88" dur="5.52">the in the tens of millions and I think</text>
  <text start="195.94" dur="4.17">that hopefully gab is ready for it or</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="4.47">some of the other platforms as well you</text>
  <text start="200.11" dur="4.53">know we got real news we&amp;#39;ve got the Utah</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="4.05">gun exchange video platform where they</text>
  <text start="204.64" dur="4.23">set that up very good quality and if</text>
  <text start="206.92" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re youtuber it takes seconds to</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="3.54">import your video two seconds to import</text>
  <text start="210.61" dur="3.99">your video you can actually just put the</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="3.48">link in import and then hit OK and it</text>
  <text start="214.6" dur="3.69">just pulls all the data over from</text>
  <text start="215.89" dur="4.2">YouTube and it&amp;#39;s really cool feature and</text>
  <text start="218.29" dur="3.3">they put that up when when YouTube</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="4.5">started banning all the pro-gun videos</text>
  <text start="221.59" dur="5.19">so there you go we definitely have other</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="6.39">options not to mention the decentralized</text>
  <text start="226.78" dur="5.37">bitch shoot D Tube minds.com I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="230.98" dur="5.759">even gotten on there to look at it yet</text>
  <text start="232.15" dur="7.62">but mine&amp;#39;s calm is one of them now kind</text>
  <text start="236.739" dur="5.491">of off the topic for just a second but</text>
  <text start="239.77" dur="3.719">MK ULTRA land and what&amp;#39;s going on with Q</text>
  <text start="242.23" dur="2.46">and all the stuff that&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="243.489" dur="4.321">the child trafficking and all of that</text>
  <text start="244.69" dur="4.56">stuff there&amp;#39;s a lot around red shoes</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="3.33">like there&amp;#39;s a lot of symbolism around</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="3.95">red shoes and the MKULTRA thing goes</text>
  <text start="251.14" dur="4.89">back to kind of the Wizard of Oz and and</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="4.3">in Alice in Wonderland and things like</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="2.61">that you know over the rainbow through</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="3.03">the looking-glass all of these</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="4.29">disassociation terms where they torture</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="4.53">people and force them into disassociated</text>
  <text start="262.93" dur="4.17">disassociative split personalities I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="3.6">done videos on this before as well</text>
  <text start="267.1" dur="3.18">I walk you through some of the video</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="4.56">games that they&amp;#39;re now you know showing</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="6">children which are filled with MKULTRA</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="5.43">symbolism like American McGee&amp;#39;s Alice I</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="4.29">did a video on that which was deep dark</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="4.11">disturbing but makes a very very very</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="3.92">good point about how this stuff works it</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="4.68">kind of explains this stuff to people</text>
  <text start="284.49" dur="4.72">it&amp;#39;s not an easy video to go through if</text>
  <text start="287.44" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re like an adult you&amp;#39;ve you know an</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="3.24">older person and you&amp;#39;ve never seen this</text>
  <text start="290.59" dur="4.05">kind of video game before I mean these</text>
  <text start="292.45" dur="3.75">are not not nothing new to me I actually</text>
  <text start="294.64" dur="3.57">played that game when I was young right</text>
  <text start="296.2" dur="3.51">like I actually played American McGee&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="4.5">Alice and it actually gave me nightmares</text>
  <text start="299.71" dur="4.56">and I quit play in it but at the time I</text>
  <text start="302.71" dur="5.25">thought hey cool game it&amp;#39;s really kind</text>
  <text start="304.27" dur="5.37">of eerie and Gothic and whatever but you</text>
  <text start="307.96" dur="3.6">know then I could then later on go back</text>
  <text start="309.64" dur="5.16">and use it to explain how an Kael tral</text>
  <text start="311.56" dur="5.73">works and now it&amp;#39;s coming out that the</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="4.59">you know we have all these red red shoes</text>
  <text start="317.29" dur="3.66">coming out from cue lately like these</text>
  <text start="319.39" dur="3.33">parties filled with Podesta and his</text>
  <text start="320.95" dur="3.96">friends they all have red shoes on and</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="3.87">you know we had Bill Maher with red</text>
  <text start="324.91" dur="3.81">shoes on and it&amp;#39;s not just a fashion</text>
  <text start="326.59" dur="3.69">statement guys it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="328.72" dur="3.39">there about being on the inside of the</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="4.26">the pedo club or something going on</text>
  <text start="332.11" dur="4.14">there it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an insider&amp;#39;s game and</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="3.45">I&amp;#39;m not quite 100% sure what the red</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="4.17">shoe symbols are yet but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.99" dur="5.31">obviously some sort of a birdcall or or</text>
  <text start="340.42" dur="5.1">symbol sent to either each other or two</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="4.47">victims out there of MKULTRA maybe even</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="3.9">to trigger them into doing something you</text>
  <text start="347.77" dur="3.18">know when you when you disassociate the</text>
  <text start="349.42" dur="5.04">personalities into different ones you</text>
  <text start="350.95" dur="6.45">can plant commands with some of them I</text>
  <text start="354.46" dur="5.4">mean they can be assassins they can be</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="5.34">you know the the sex kitten types they</text>
  <text start="359.86" dur="3.9">can be all these different ones so what</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="2.64">is it that they&amp;#39;re trying to show with</text>
  <text start="363.76" dur="6.81">red shoes well the reason I bring this</text>
  <text start="365.38" dur="7.58">up is because the FBI has now of all</text>
  <text start="370.57" dur="4.65">times when this is all prevalent</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="4.18">recovered the the stolen ruby slippers</text>
  <text start="375.22" dur="4.14">from The Wizard of Oz which by the way</text>
  <text start="377.14" dur="4.05">they were silver originally and they</text>
  <text start="379.36" dur="7.46">were changed to Ruby by Hollywood I</text>
  <text start="381.19" dur="9.42">wonder why now the also also having that</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="5.65">DOJ whistleblowers are now saying that</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="6.27">mule were illegally threatened general</text>
  <text start="392.47" dur="6.99">Flynn with prison basically for for</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="6.15">campaigning with GOP candidates</text>
  <text start="399.46" dur="7.38">I think it was Omar Navarro had come out</text>
  <text start="403.03" dur="5.34">and and then he was gonna start to do</text>
  <text start="406.84" dur="3.44">some other things and then he backed out</text>
  <text start="408.37" dur="4.019">so it was a family emergency well</text>
  <text start="410.28" dur="3.49">according to true pundit Mueller</text>
  <text start="412.389" dur="3.631">threatened Flynn with new charges in</text>
  <text start="413.77" dur="5.82">prison time and this is from a DOJ</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="5.25">source he says quote he claimed Flynn</text>
  <text start="419.59" dur="3.77">was trying to elect Trump like</text>
  <text start="421.27" dur="5.45">candidates to secure himself a</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="3.36">presidential pardon</text>
  <text start="427.66" dur="5.009">that&amp;#39;s a stupid thing anyway and that</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="4.41">type of tampering coercion and</text>
  <text start="432.669" dur="3.421">suppression is very legal breaching</text>
  <text start="434.47" dur="3.99">several federal laws per federal</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="5.009">statutes and Justice Department said</text>
  <text start="438.46" dur="4.95">Justice Department officials Mueller has</text>
  <text start="441.099" dur="5.011">broken laws here one FBI official said</text>
  <text start="443.41" dur="4.95">noting the breached laws dwarfed Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.11" dur="4.619">offense these are felonies his office</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="4.5">should be investigated what felonies did</text>
  <text start="450.729" dur="4.201">Mueller and his cohorts shatter per the</text>
  <text start="452.86" dur="3.6">Justice Department and well-placed DOJ</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="3.72">officials certain election related</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="4.35">felonies apply but certainly tenets of</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="4.079">witness tampering and coercion wire</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="4.71">fraud could apply among other violations</text>
  <text start="462.729" dur="6.391">official said coercion of political</text>
  <text start="465.52" dur="7.16">activity 18 USC 610 is an anti</text>

  <text start="502.389" dur="5.25">felony it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s worse than what general</text>
  <text start="504.34" dur="5.46">Flynn it did anyway and that is it for</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="5.52">the news I&amp;#39;m now gonna go over and do</text>
  <text start="509.8" dur="5.76">the Q video and I still can&amp;#39;t believe</text>

  <text start="527.8" dur="3.63">day I don&amp;#39;t know I used to get some</text>
  <text start="529.57" dur="2.94">pretty decent views and then the censor</text>
  <text start="531.43" dur="3.3">hit me again and then I got</text>
  <text start="532.51" dur="4.68">banned and then up from from that point</text>

  <text start="539.32" dur="5.34">nearly done I&amp;#39;m really like looking</text>
  <text start="542.8" dur="4.95">forward to the days when when Trump</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="4.83">switches over to a new platform and some</text>
  <text start="547.75" dur="3.78">of these platforms are held accountable</text>
  <text start="549.49" dur="4.11">in a court of law for discrimination and</text>
  <text start="551.53" dur="4.14">things like that and you know so much</text>
