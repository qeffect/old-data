  <text start="46.54" dur="3.539">anon movement have actually been there</text>
  <text start="48.28" dur="5.4">since the beginning and I helped build</text>
  <text start="50.079" dur="5.461">it in my own small way I contributed to</text>
  <text start="53.68" dur="5.699">that before it was even known to most of</text>
  <text start="55.54" dur="5.85">the world now I&amp;#39;ve always been a kind of</text>
  <text start="59.379" dur="3.691">a defender of the queue and on movement</text>
  <text start="61.39" dur="4.26">and I&amp;#39;ve always done that not from a</text>
  <text start="63.07" dur="4.65">position of faith or cultism or whatever</text>
  <text start="65.65" dur="4.98">the MSM want to call it but logic</text>
  <text start="67.72" dur="5.57">evidence reason and compassion and these</text>
  <text start="70.63" dur="6.239">are very important things to me now I</text>

  <text start="93.6" dur="4.33">now I only I do not encourage that I</text>
  <text start="96.37" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s gonna win you any</text>
  <text start="97.93" dur="6.479">friends actually remember the ego if you</text>
  <text start="100.99" dur="4.59">prove someone wrong oftentimes even if</text>
  <text start="104.409" dur="3.541">you prove them wrong</text>
  <text start="105.58" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;ll double down their belief they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="107.95" dur="6.599">hate you and they&amp;#39;ll believe it harder</text>

  <text start="157.749" dur="6.501">that shifts the Overton Window that we</text>
  <text start="160.08" dur="7.02">been talking about but we shouldn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="164.25" dur="6.03">I told you so what we should do is just</text>
  <text start="167.1" dur="6.63">reinforce the major points as to why we</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="5.79">are fighting so hard we are trying to</text>

  <text start="515.37" dur="3.779">have to address this issue not from a</text>
  <text start="517.229" dur="3.87">position of anger but from a position of</text>
  <text start="519.149" dur="3.651">concern especially for the children but</text>
  <text start="521.099" dur="5.401">also for the victims of gender dysphoria</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="7.3">who are being told that you&amp;#39;re a victim</text>
  <text start="526.5" dur="6">and that you should you know be proud of</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="4.5">this rather than seek treatment that</text>

  <text start="546.17" dur="9.43">issue this is a mind issue now again and</text>
  <text start="553.709" dur="6.331">again we see examples where this has</text>
  <text start="555.6" dur="6.59">harm to children mixed bathrooms</text>

  <text start="821.07" dur="3">movement maybe we can do something about</text>
  <text start="822.66" dur="3.39">that but</text>
  <text start="824.07" dur="3.78">I think we do need a move to go back to</text>

  <text start="954.18" dur="5.349">yeah and Trump it added big US taxpayer</text>
  <text start="957.459" dur="3.151">dollars going to them was cut off by me</text>

  <text start="965.589" dur="6.81">send people if we don&amp;#39;t pay them I guess</text>
  <text start="967.39" dur="6.72">in some cases here we go we want to take</text>
  <text start="972.399" dur="3.601">you now to the White House we&amp;#39;re moments</text>
  <text start="974.11" dur="4.32">ago President Trump announced a new</text>
  <text start="976" dur="4.589">asylum agreement with Guatemala let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="978.43" dur="4.82">listen in thank you all very much</text>
  <text start="980.589" dur="2.661">appreciate it</text>
  <text start="986.269" dur="7.36">look we&amp;#39;ve been dealing for many years I</text>
  <text start="989.459" dur="6.78">would say with Guatemala and with other</text>
  <text start="993.629" dur="6.03">countries and we are now at a point</text>
  <text start="996.239" dur="5.85">where we are we just get along and</text>
  <text start="999.659" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re doing what we&amp;#39;ve asked them to</text>
  <text start="1002.089" dur="4.05">do and I think it&amp;#39;s going to be a great</text>
  <text start="1004.669" dur="4.77">thing for Guatemala they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1006.139" dur="5.1">these problems either so we were able to</text>
  <text start="1009.439" dur="4.05">get this done and we got it done fairly</text>
  <text start="1011.239" dur="4.981">quickly but this is after many many</text>
  <text start="1013.489" dur="4.38">years Mexico also is working along with</text>
  <text start="1016.22" dur="4.679">us very nicely I mean tremendously</text>
  <text start="1017.869" dur="5.22">actually you&amp;#39;ll see a chart where the</text>
  <text start="1020.899" dur="3.69">numbers are really through the through</text>
  <text start="1023.089" dur="3.42">the floor I should say because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1024.589" dur="3.54">going down Kevin maybe you want to speak</text>
  <text start="1026.509" dur="3.93">to the numbers how well we&amp;#39;re doing on</text>
  <text start="1028.129" dur="3.93">in terms of apprehensions absolutely mr.</text>
  <text start="1030.439" dur="4.89">president since the agreement was signed</text>
  <text start="1032.059" dur="5.49">with Mexico that you energized and drove</text>
  <text start="1035.329" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;ve had 28 percent reduction in June</text>
  <text start="1037.549" dur="4.71">and we&amp;#39;re headed toward another 22</text>
  <text start="1039.649" dur="4.98">percent reduction in July in crossings</text>
  <text start="1042.259" dur="4.05">so 43 percent overall thanks to the</text>
  <text start="1044.629" dur="2.88">effort on the government Mexico side and</text>
  <text start="1046.309" dur="3.811">the implementation of our migrant</text>
  <text start="1047.509" dur="4.65">protection protocols border wide and the</text>
  <text start="1050.12" dur="4.74">fact that they do have really a big</text>
  <text start="1052.159" dur="5.581">slowdown coming in from Guatemala at the</text>
  <text start="1054.86" dur="4.319">border because we have again 6,000</text>
  <text start="1057.74" dur="3.12">Mexican troops at the border of</text>
  <text start="1059.179" dur="3.661">Guatemala so that helps but this will</text>
  <text start="1060.86" dur="3.84">really help this is something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1062.84" dur="3.839">going to be rather incredible so the</text>
  <text start="1064.7" dur="5.28">numbers are going that we we could</text>
  <text start="1066.679" dur="6.63">really do this in a much easier fashion</text>
  <text start="1069.98" dur="7.77">if we had cooperation from the Democrats</text>
  <text start="1073.309" dur="6.12">we have absolutely no cooperation nobody</text>
  <text start="1077.75" dur="3.389">can understand and most of these people</text>
  <text start="1079.429" dur="3.931">five years ago they all wanted a wall</text>
  <text start="1081.139" dur="5.16">and we&amp;#39;re building a lot of wall right</text>
