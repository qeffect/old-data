  <text start="103.17" dur="3.39">and you don&amp;#39;t have to use your main</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="3.211">business name I think the better option</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="3.15">is actually to white label create a</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="3.96">second business doing the same thing run</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="4.29">it through your infrastructure but make</text>

  <text start="120.45" dur="3.39">I found that every business I touch</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="3.541">turns to gold and I would like to help</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="3.47">others do the same thing and in so doing</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="3.26">help some of my buddy</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="4.71">and other truthers out there the</text>
  <text start="128.78" dur="5.64">journalists that need funding they are</text>
  <text start="132.02" dur="4.65">they are having a hard time guys I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="134.42" dur="4.59">shown my own recent stats on YouTube</text>
  <text start="136.67" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;ve shown you you know huge spikes up</text>
  <text start="139.01" dur="3.87">you know remember I would I started at</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="4.17">twelve hundred subs a day for the first</text>
  <text start="142.88" dur="3.39">eleven days until the algorithm caught</text>
  <text start="144.89" dur="4.08">up with me and then it went down to like</text>
  <text start="146.27" dur="5.49">50 and that was back when queue was</text>
  <text start="148.97" dur="5.34">unheard of okay so in more recent times</text>
  <text start="151.76" dur="5.49">I&amp;#39;ve been stuck at 96 thousand</text>
  <text start="154.31" dur="5.52">subscribers since January in that time I</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="4.709">have gone on dozens of other talk shows</text>
  <text start="159.83" dur="4.77">with probably millions of total reach</text>
  <text start="161.959" dur="4.441">I&amp;#39;ve been part of a best-selling book</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="3.69">obviously I take no credit that was the</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="3.24">where we go when we go all philosophy as</text>
  <text start="168.29" dur="4.35">a tactic and that was really cool</text>
  <text start="169.64" dur="4.53">teamwork we really snuck up on Amazon</text>
  <text start="172.64" dur="4.5">and forced it down their throat so to</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="5.46">speak in terms of our narrative and</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="4.08">taking away from them and taking ground</text>
  <text start="179.63" dur="3.66">against the deep state narrative</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="3.299">obviously that was a massive victory and</text>
  <text start="183.29" dur="4.04">that&amp;#39;s why they attacked us it&amp;#39;s the way</text>
  <text start="184.519" dur="5.461">that they did on such a massive scale</text>
  <text start="187.33" dur="4.57">even Artie and BC everybody was making</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="4.77">video hit pieces about the book right</text>
  <text start="191.9" dur="5.85">like they could not handle they they</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="4.98">lost their shit my friends because of</text>
  <text start="197.75" dur="3.9">our book beat McCabe&amp;#39;s deep state book</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="3.18">it almost beat well they were starting</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="4.44">to mess with it pretty heavily at that</text>
  <text start="202.91" dur="5.85">point we still beat McCabe&amp;#39;s book but we</text>
  <text start="206.09" dur="5.54">almost beat Michelle Obama&amp;#39;s book and</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="5.19">they they stopped us right below first</text>
  <text start="211.63" dur="5.56">after pulling hundreds of confirmed</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="3.87">purchase reviews so the queue book is a</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="3.359">best-seller</text>
  <text start="217.82" dur="4.55">it always won&amp;#39;t be and although they</text>
  <text start="220.549" dur="4.111">sort of messed with it and robbed it</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="3.73">that&amp;#39;s appropriate I think I think</text>
  <text start="224.66" dur="4.049">that&amp;#39;s exactly the way it should be I</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="4.05">would have been a little concerned if</text>
  <text start="228.709" dur="2.911">they didn&amp;#39;t try to censor it on some</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="3.209">level I would have felt like maybe we</text>
  <text start="231.62" dur="3.69">were robbed of something there I</text>
  <text start="233.359" dur="4.621">considered a victory every time they</text>
  <text start="235.31" dur="4.38">attacked us in this way and frankly I</text>
  <text start="237.98" dur="3.15">think at this point our team expects it</text>
  <text start="239.69" dur="3.389">like if you&amp;#39;re not getting censured like</text>
  <text start="241.13" dur="3.9">them I don&amp;#39;t trust you</text>
  <text start="243.079" dur="6.121">that seems to me the usual prevailing</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="5.79">wisdom and it&amp;#39;s pretty wise that said</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="4.75">you know some of my needs and wants</text>
  <text start="250.82" dur="4.749">obviously funding if you can help</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="4.17">you can swing it we can throw another</text>
  <text start="255.569" dur="4.471">dollar over five dollars for $17 a month</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="4.68">you know you get perks with the the most</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="5.19">Network thing with that it doesn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="4.83">a lot of that mm-hmm I did a fundraiser</text>
  <text start="265.23" dur="4.95">I put up in my video a while back and I</text>
  <text start="267.63" dur="4.41">talked about it basically I barely even</text>
  <text start="270.18" dur="4.95">mentioned it because you know guys I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="272.04" dur="4.77">bad at plugging and in that time we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="275.13" dur="3.66">been able to grow the business enough</text>
  <text start="276.81" dur="3.63">through you know our sponsors and such</text>
  <text start="278.79" dur="4.89">like a impacts health club getting</text>
  <text start="280.44" dur="4.199">amazing things like carbon 60 which my</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="2.67">opinion Fountain of Youth</text>
  <text start="284.639" dur="3.151">I think the study&amp;#39;s figures speak for</text>
  <text start="286.35" dur="3.06">themselves I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;ll ever</text>
  <text start="287.79" dur="3.72">let this thing get out there in a big</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="4.2">way but right now it&amp;#39;s still available</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="4.71">and that new technology is a very</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="4.559">interesting you know but but even carbon</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="3.27">60 aside other amazing product</text>
  <text start="298.169" dur="3.72">supplements things that you absolutely</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="4.02">need in your life like magnesium and</text>
  <text start="301.889" dur="3.271">iodine things like that good qualities</text>

  <text start="529.759" dur="5.161">to do that so it&amp;#39;s probably gonna be</text>
  <text start="531.91" dur="5.979">rough estimates about thirty five</text>
  <text start="534.92" dur="4.74">hundred dollars per and then from there</text>
