  <text start="664.4" dur="3.3">acts of great violence and oppression</text>
  <text start="665.72" dur="3.3">and then we&amp;#39;ve learned from it with</text>
  <text start="667.7" dur="3.509">things like the Renaissance we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="669.02" dur="4.2">our our shift we&amp;#39;ve had our cultural</text>
  <text start="671.209" dur="3.57">shift to where we understand these</text>
  <text start="673.22" dur="3.11">things and we understand things like the</text>
  <text start="674.779" dur="3.93">need for separation of church and state</text>
  <text start="676.33" dur="4.36">otherwise all the churches basically</text>
  <text start="678.709" dur="3.931">battle for control of the state to</text>
  <text start="680.69" dur="4.32">destroy and destroy and kill all the</text>
  <text start="682.64" dur="4.17">other religions out there so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="685.01" dur="4.53">we had to separate these two powers</text>
  <text start="686.81" dur="5.399">right we never want to have all of the</text>
  <text start="689.54" dur="4.549">power in one place in fact separation of</text>
  <text start="692.209" dur="4.521">church and state is a lot like the</text>
  <text start="694.089" dur="4.961">decentralized power of the original</text>
  <text start="696.73" dur="5.08">republic that we have the constitutional</text>
  <text start="699.05" dur="4.71">republic that we have here it set checks</text>
  <text start="701.81" dur="3.81">and balances you know just like we have</text>
  <text start="703.76" dur="3.69">the three branches of government well</text>
  <text start="705.62" dur="3.3">religion was like the fourth branch of</text>
  <text start="707.45" dur="2.25">government they just separated it</text>
  <text start="708.92" dur="2.88">completely right</text>
  <text start="709.7" dur="4.199">just like the media it&amp;#39;s become the</text>
  <text start="711.8" dur="4.68">fourth branch of government now they</text>
  <text start="713.899" dur="3.991">need to separate you know religion and</text>
  <text start="716.48" dur="4.14">like the church and state but they also</text>
  <text start="717.89" dur="4.17">need a separate state and a media and</text>
  <text start="720.62" dur="4.56">state and entertainment because these</text>
  <text start="722.06" dur="4.95">power bases that we trust in or we have</text>
  <text start="725.18" dur="4.23">trusted in the past are being used to</text>
  <text start="727.01" dur="2.55">destroy and subvert the very ideas that</text>
  <text start="729.41" dur="2.28">we</text>
  <text start="729.56" dur="4.53">were born into the very freedoms that we</text>
  <text start="731.69" dur="4.92">cherished and and people have died and</text>
