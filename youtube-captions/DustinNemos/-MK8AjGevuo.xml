  <text start="13.16" dur="9.369">hey guys this is a video more about the</text>
  <text start="19.4" dur="4.93">the comments that I&amp;#39;ve made recently and</text>
  <text start="22.529" dur="5.73">there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a dialogue going on in</text>
  <text start="24.33" dur="4.71">the comments people are on both sides of</text>
  <text start="28.259" dur="2.971">the fence</text>
  <text start="29.04" dur="4.14">supporting and negative about some of</text>
  <text start="31.23" dur="3.9">the things I&amp;#39;ve said and I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="3.45">going off in the weeds I&amp;#39;m actually I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="35.13" dur="3.15">already done with my research for the</text>
  <text start="36.63" dur="4.08">day I&amp;#39;ve already made my video this is</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="4.14">more you know just intellectually</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="3.39">interesting and maybe you guys will will</text>
  <text start="42.42" dur="3.51">be interested in hearing it but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="44.1" dur="3.33">news and it&amp;#39;s not queueing on so if you</text>
  <text start="45.93" dur="5.1">if you&amp;#39;re just tuning in for those you</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="5.64">might want to skip this one I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="6.66">draw on some personal experiences and</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="9.9">I&amp;#39;m going to share a book I enjoy as</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="6.81">well on this topic now this all started</text>
  <text start="62.97" dur="4.59">when I was when I was basically very</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="5.579">hard on prostitutes but I also said I</text>
  <text start="67.56" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t think this should be illegal I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="70.079" dur="3.801">going to kind of give you my position on</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="4.38">this real fast</text>
  <text start="73.88" dur="4.81">basically I follow the non-aggression</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="5.94">principle and it&amp;#39;s a moral stance it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="78.69" dur="6.27">philosophical stance and it basically no</text>
  <text start="82.71" dur="3.75">victim no crime right that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="3.42">a pretty common sentiment a lot of</text>
  <text start="86.46" dur="3.81">people feel that way I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="3.75">you should be arrested or have your</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="3.33">money stolen through fines just because</text>
  <text start="92.13" dur="2.94">you didn&amp;#39;t wear a seatbelt although it</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="3.18">may be it&amp;#39;s kind of stupid not to wear a</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="3.87">seatbelt especially if you&amp;#39;re driving in</text>
  <text start="96.78" dur="5.34">a dangerous area or really fast whatever</text>
  <text start="98.94" dur="4.89">but that&amp;#39;s your life right a free man</text>
  <text start="102.12" dur="3.33">may make stupid decisions but if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.83" dur="4.89">not able to make stupid decisions he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="4.77">not free and I&amp;#39;m all about the freedom</text>
  <text start="108.72" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s kind of more more I guess</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="5.61">libertarian although I&amp;#39;m Way behind</text>
  <text start="113.4" dur="4.86">libertarian as a voluntary estai I kind</text>
  <text start="115.83" dur="4.86">of I&amp;#39;ve gone beyond just smaller</text>
  <text start="118.26" dur="10.05">government and all of that I&amp;#39;m I want</text>
  <text start="120.69" dur="9.12">absolute freedom that said you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.319">mentioned in the past the moral</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="6.3">foundations and there&amp;#39;s there six of</text>
  <text start="132.629" dur="7.641">them and I share the conservative moral</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="7.79">foundations except the the Authority</text>
  <text start="140.27" dur="6.9">spectrum I I do not trust Authority</text>
  <text start="143.9" dur="4.98">in fact let me let me pull that up for</text>
  <text start="147.17" dur="4.32">you guys real fast so I can kind of</text>
  <text start="148.88" dur="6.59">speak with this specifically is that a</text>
  <text start="151.49" dur="7.41">word specific I know I can be specific</text>
  <text start="155.47" dur="6.52">so those moral foundations one is care</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="5.04">and harm like you believe in caring and</text>
  <text start="161.99" dur="3.6">harming the foundation is related to our</text>
  <text start="163.94" dur="3.51">long evolution as mammals with</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="4.29">attachment systems and an ability to</text>
  <text start="167.45" dur="4.74">feel and dislike the pain of others it</text>
  <text start="169.88" dur="4.83">underlies virtues of kindness gentleness</text>
  <text start="172.19" dur="5.16">and nurturance now this is something</text>
  <text start="174.71" dur="4.95">pretty strong on the left and also on</text>
  <text start="177.35" dur="5.97">the right and also something that I</text>
  <text start="179.66" dur="6.75">share we all unless we&amp;#39;re Psychopaths or</text>
  <text start="183.32" dur="5.07">sociopaths dislike seeing pain and</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="4.799">others else your baby and then they just</text>
  <text start="188.39" dur="4.35">laugh there&amp;#39;s the fairness in cheating</text>
  <text start="191.209" dur="3.661">now this is a big one on the left as</text>
  <text start="192.74" dur="4.23">well this foundation is related to the</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="5.07">evolutionary process of reciprocal</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="7.46">altruism it generates ideas of justice</text>
  <text start="199.94" dur="6.84">rights and autonomy fairness included</text>
  <text start="204.43" dur="4.24">concerns about equality which are more</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="3.989">strongly endorsed by political liberals</text>
  <text start="208.67" dur="4.41">however they reformulated the theory in</text>
  <text start="210.769" dur="4.891">2011 based on some new data and they</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="4.59">emphasize proportionality which is</text>
  <text start="215.66" dur="3.27">endorsed by everyone but is more</text>
  <text start="217.67" dur="5.75">strongly endorsed endorsed by</text>
  <text start="218.93" dur="6.99">conservatives 3 is loyalty and betrayal</text>
  <text start="223.42" dur="4.42">now this foundation is related to our</text>
  <text start="225.92" dur="4.17">long history as tribal creatures able to</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="4.53">form shifting coalition&amp;#39;s it underlies</text>
  <text start="230.09" dur="5.04">virtues of patriotism and self-sacrifice</text>
  <text start="232.37" dur="4.53">for the group it is active anytime and</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="5.85">people feel that it&amp;#39;s one for all and</text>
  <text start="236.9" dur="6.24">all for one for now this is the one that</text>
  <text start="240.98" dur="3.96">I different outlook conservatives</text>
  <text start="243.14" dur="5.55">basically hit all of these liberals hit</text>
  <text start="244.94" dur="6.269">like two or three of them and for is</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="4.26">Authority and subversion this foundation</text>
  <text start="251.209" dur="3.81">was shaped by our long primate history</text>
  <text start="252.95" dur="3.87">of hierarchical social interactions it</text>
  <text start="255.019" dur="3.96">underlies virtues of leadership and</text>
  <text start="256.82" dur="3.69">followership including deference to</text>
  <text start="258.979" dur="4.951">legitimate Authority and respect for</text>
  <text start="260.51" dur="5.55">traditions now I do have some respect</text>
  <text start="263.93" dur="5.58">for certain traditions but by no means</text>
  <text start="266.06" dur="7.35">is it a default practice and I have zero</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="5.64">respect for authority meaning those in</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="3.72">power now I have great respect for</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="3.69">people who are in a position of</text>
  <text start="277.13" dur="5.01">intellectual Authority like maybe an</text>
  <text start="278.84" dur="5.76">expert in a field you know I like to use</text>
  <text start="282.14" dur="5.07">quotes from from famous philosophers for</text>
  <text start="284.6" dur="4.47">example but in terms this is the one</text>
  <text start="287.21" dur="3.84">that gives a lot of conservatives pause</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="4.41">when I talk about not wanting a</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="4.8">government and this is the one that I</text>
  <text start="293.48" dur="3.42">lack this is the one moral foundation</text>
  <text start="295.85" dur="3.36">that I don&amp;#39;t share with other</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="4.14">conservatives so there is a little bit</text>
  <text start="299.21" dur="3.84">of a difference although we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="301.04" dur="5.19">very pretty much all far far far far</text>
  <text start="303.05" dur="5.07">right compared to like a liberal in</text>
  <text start="306.23" dur="2.64">there&amp;#39;s room for some variety there you</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="3.75">know don&amp;#39;t hate me</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="4.65">five is sanctity and degradation all</text>
  <text start="311.87" dur="3.24">right now this foundation was shaped by</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="3.66">the psychology of disgust and</text>
  <text start="315.11" dur="3.66">contamination it underlies religious</text>
  <text start="317.18" dur="4.53">notions of striving to live in an</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="4.77">elevated less carnal more noble way it</text>
  <text start="321.71" dur="4.08">underlies the widespread idea that the</text>
  <text start="323.54" dur="4.14">body is a temple which can be desecrated</text>
  <text start="325.79" dur="4.89">by immoral activities and contaminants</text>
  <text start="327.68" dur="7.62">which is not an idea that&amp;#39;s unique to</text>
  <text start="330.68" dur="6.36">religious traditions so this is the one</text>
  <text start="335.3" dur="3.9">that I&amp;#39;m speaking from when I talk about</text>
  <text start="337.04" dur="3.81">prostitutes all right and before I go</text>
  <text start="339.2" dur="3.48">into that any further I&amp;#39;m gonna share a</text>
  <text start="340.85" dur="2.82">story with you all right now as many of</text>
  <text start="342.68" dur="4.2">you know have been following my channel</text>
  <text start="343.67" dur="5.49">and this is not for sympathy my brother</text>
  <text start="346.88" dur="5.64">my sister and my mother have all gotten</text>
  <text start="349.16" dur="5.01">into drugs they started on you know the</text>
  <text start="352.52" dur="2.91">little painkillers they would buy from</text>
  <text start="354.17" dur="2.28">their friends or they would get from</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="4.47">their friends they would you know</text>
  <text start="356.45" dur="6.45">parties and stuff they moved into the</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="4.56">cheaper heroin things like that and it</text>
  <text start="362.9" dur="5.04">got to the point where it was pretty bad</text>
  <text start="364.46" dur="5.13">um at one point I remember you know and</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="3.66">all throughout my childhood my mother</text>
  <text start="369.59" dur="3.93">was on and off drugs and with shitty man</text>
  <text start="371.6" dur="5.52">things like that but I remember at one</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="5.13">point she called me late at night around</text>
  <text start="377.12" dur="4.41">like 11:00 or something if I can recall</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s been a long time wanting some gas</text>
  <text start="381.53" dur="4.02">money like she was broke down she&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="383.42" dur="4.41">the gas station she had no gas she asked</text>
  <text start="385.55" dur="4.17">me if I could bring her five bucks well</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="3.54">I mean I grew up with this so I kind of</text>
  <text start="389.72" dur="3.15">knew what to expect a little bit I kind</text>
  <text start="391.37" dur="3.36">of assumed that it was for drugs but</text>
  <text start="392.87" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s my mom she&amp;#39;s out there in the dark</text>
  <text start="394.73" dur="5.67">I have to go help her right now I got a</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="8.49">good part of town so I go out there and</text>
  <text start="400.4" dur="6">I offer to put gas in her tank I offer</text>
  <text start="404.75" dur="4.62">to fill up her tank so she could at</text>
  <text start="406.4" dur="4.23">least get home she gets mad she&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="409.37" dur="1.99">defensive and angry and she&amp;#39;s like no I</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="2.83">just want the cat</text>
  <text start="411.36" dur="3.329">and I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m not gonna give you cash</text>
  <text start="413.46" dur="3.06">I know what you&amp;#39;ll do with it you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="414.689" dur="3.151">spend it on drugs you never here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="416.52" dur="4.109">rule for dealing with drug addicts never</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="4.74">ever give them anything and that may</text>
  <text start="420.629" dur="3.78">even include a place on the couch you</text>
  <text start="422.58" dur="3.42">really don&amp;#39;t want that either but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.409" dur="3.181">just my opinion a lot of people just</text>
  <text start="426" dur="3.03">want to help them and try to like</text>
  <text start="427.59" dur="4.049">nurture them through it and there are</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="5.4">some maybe that that can help but in my</text>
  <text start="431.639" dur="4.471">experience which I&amp;#39;m sharing with you I</text>
  <text start="434.43" dur="3.449">don&amp;#39;t generally think that you can help</text>
  <text start="436.11" dur="3.6">them by helping them I think you could</text>
  <text start="437.879" dur="3.151">help them by cutting them off and</text>
  <text start="439.71" dur="3.929">letting them hit rock bottom that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="441.03" dur="4.229">position and which kind of speaks from</text>
  <text start="443.639" dur="3.571">the sanctity degradation moral</text>
  <text start="445.259" dur="3.361">foundation and there is a sixth one</text>
  <text start="447.21" dur="9.989">Liberty and oppression and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.62" dur="10.65">a big one for me too now when I got</text>
  <text start="457.199" dur="3.93">there and she was really angry about it</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="4.709">she wanted the cash I told her no I</text>
  <text start="461.129" dur="4.921">would put gas in her tank she refused</text>
  <text start="463.979" dur="4.74">she already had gas in her tank what she</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="4.26">wanted was drug money and when I refused</text>
  <text start="468.719" dur="3.871">to give her any I was basically about to</text>
  <text start="470.31" dur="7.5">leave she said fine I&amp;#39;ll suck dick for</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="9.329">it so this is you know that obviously</text>
  <text start="477.81" dur="6.06">for a young teenage boy this is the kind</text>
  <text start="481.919" dur="3.451">of thing that kind of sets your opinions</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="3.479">about the world and I&amp;#39;m not blaming my</text>
  <text start="485.37" dur="3.78">mother for this you know I&amp;#39;ve come to</text>
  <text start="487.349" dur="6">these opinions based on other things as</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="6.72">well logical rational cause and effect</text>
  <text start="493.349" dur="3.87">and incentive disincentives you know I</text>
  <text start="495.87" dur="3.87">have a I think I have a pretty strong</text>
  <text start="497.219" dur="4.23">understanding of incentives because that</text>
  <text start="499.74" dur="3.87">plays into economics and such as well</text>
  <text start="501.449" dur="3.451">like obviously with with the welfare</text>
  <text start="503.61" dur="3.239">system you&amp;#39;re gonna have tons of people</text>
  <text start="504.9" dur="5.1">coming here wanting the free stuff right</text>
  <text start="506.849" dur="4.801">but if you get rid of the free stuff you</text>
  <text start="510" dur="3.029">won&amp;#39;t even have to pay anybody to deport</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="2.519">them they&amp;#39;ll probably just go away on</text>
  <text start="513.029" dur="4.981">their own because they&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="514.169" dur="5.641">the free stuff anymore so you know our</text>
  <text start="518.01" dur="3.48">immigrant problem is really an incentive</text>
  <text start="519.81" dur="3.63">problem where we&amp;#39;re giving out free</text>
  <text start="521.49" dur="4.62">stuff and saying hey doors open come get</text>
  <text start="523.44" dur="4.44">it you know if you want an easy way to</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="4.469">understand that imagine how that would</text>
  <text start="527.88" dur="4.23">play out in in your home if you open the</text>
  <text start="530.579" dur="3.151">door to all the homeless people and said</text>
  <text start="532.11" dur="3.539">please come in there&amp;#39;s free stuff stay</text>
  <text start="533.73" dur="4.109">as long as you like eventually you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="535.649" dur="4.141">gonna get taken advantage of and</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="3.491">eventually it&amp;#39;ll outgrow what you can</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="6.03">afford and you&amp;#39;ll become poor</text>
  <text start="541.33" dur="7.8">and they&amp;#39;ll drag you down so I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="545.82" dur="7.78">don&amp;#39;t think that I&amp;#39;m being unsympathetic</text>
  <text start="549.13" dur="7.29">or uncompassionate or on empathic to</text>
  <text start="553.6" dur="5.37">drug addicts I think that this approach</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="4.11">is the best way to help them and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="558.97" dur="3.72">think that they can all be helped in</text>
  <text start="560.53" dur="4.98">fact I think many of them are the crab</text>
  <text start="562.69" dur="4.35">in the bucket in the parable you put one</text>
  <text start="565.51" dur="3.21">crab in a bucket it crawls out you put</text>
  <text start="567.04" dur="2.82">two in there they will never get out</text>
  <text start="568.72" dur="4.89">because they&amp;#39;ll pull each other back</text>
  <text start="569.86" dur="6.48">down okay and that&amp;#39;s that is how it</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="4.23">often has happened in the past with with</text>
  <text start="576.34" dur="4.11">people that are involved in any kind of</text>
  <text start="577.84" dur="4.02">addiction drugs alcohol whatever they</text>

  <text start="641.65" dur="3.72">help him and frankly I gave up on my</text>
  <text start="643.87" dur="3.45">sister even years before that but I</text>
  <text start="645.37" dur="4.2">really did try with my brother for years</text>
  <text start="647.32" dur="5.07">I brought him into my home I gave him a</text>
  <text start="649.57" dur="5.55">place to you know to rent for me I</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="4.86">worked with him I tried to help him get</text>
  <text start="655.12" dur="3.84">to work and things like that and what</text>
  <text start="657.25" dur="4.29">happened you know what was the result</text>
  <text start="658.96" dur="6.24">well he he wrecked one of my cars I</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="6.87">never got paid for it he</text>
  <text start="665.2" dur="5.85">he brought people into my home that had</text>
  <text start="668.41" dur="6.36">od&amp;#39;d in the bathroom his friend&amp;#39;s mom</text>
  <text start="671.05" dur="5.22">od&amp;#39;d in the bathroom you crazy</text>
  <text start="674.77" dur="2.91">experience I ended up putting a</text>
  <text start="676.27" dur="2.73">chain-link fence through the hallway so</text>
  <text start="677.68" dur="2.42">he couldn&amp;#39;t get to my half of the house</text>
  <text start="679" dur="4.38">anymore</text>
  <text start="680.1" dur="5.83">he wouldn&amp;#39;t leave at that point I wanted</text>
  <text start="683.38" dur="4.92">to get rid of him so he brought a</text>
  <text start="685.93" dur="4.53">stripper of really like nasty</text>
  <text start="688.3" dur="4.89">personality into the home that was his</text>
  <text start="690.46" dur="4.08">new girlfriend he basically resumed what</text>
  <text start="693.19" dur="4.23">he was doing with my mother</text>
  <text start="694.54" dur="5.07">driving her to her her her plays her</text>
  <text start="697.42" dur="4.02">prostitution sessions which I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="699.61" dur="3.57">for sure but I think that he was pimping</text>
  <text start="701.44" dur="4.17">out his girlfriend as well I mean she</text>
  <text start="703.18" dur="4.5">would have guys come you know customers</text>
  <text start="705.61" dur="3.81">from from the strip club come and take</text>
  <text start="707.68" dur="3.66">her places and stuff so you know you</text>
  <text start="709.42" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s kind of obvious when you&amp;#39;ve lived</text>
  <text start="711.34" dur="5.64">around this stuff and again it&amp;#39;s not for</text>
  <text start="713.53" dur="4.95">sympathy is to try to get my perspective</text>
  <text start="716.98" dur="2.73">on this out there because maybe this can</text>
  <text start="718.48" dur="3.3">actually help people you know maybe</text>
  <text start="719.71" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re dealing with somebody in your</text>
  <text start="721.78" dur="2.76">life who you&amp;#39;ve been trying to help and</text>
  <text start="723.43" dur="3.21">you&amp;#39;ve been pouring your heart to them</text>
  <text start="724.54" dur="3.24">and they just keep taking advantage of</text>
  <text start="726.64" dur="3.84">it and you&amp;#39;re not really seeing any</text>
  <text start="727.78" dur="4.26">progress the thing is when you enable</text>
  <text start="730.48" dur="4.56">these people when you when you give them</text>
  <text start="732.04" dur="6.21">money when you make it easier on them</text>
  <text start="735.04" dur="6.75">because they&amp;#39;re having a hard time what</text>
  <text start="738.25" dur="6.84">you often end up doing is is enabling</text>
  <text start="741.79" dur="5.64">them you you end up allowing them to</text>
  <text start="745.09" dur="6.36">have enough comfort to continue in their</text>
  <text start="747.43" dur="5.73">bad choices now if I had if I had kicked</text>
  <text start="751.45" dur="4.41">my brother out and he was homeless on</text>
  <text start="753.16" dur="4.68">the street I think that he would have</text>
  <text start="755.86" dur="5.01">gotten better faster I think that he</text>
  <text start="757.84" dur="5.43">would have hit a place that was dark it</text>
  <text start="760.87" dur="3.96">was rock bottom and decided you know he</text>
  <text start="763.27" dur="3.45">would have been faced with a choice like</text>
  <text start="764.83" dur="2.84">do I continue doing this or do I do I</text>
  <text start="766.72" dur="4.22">stop</text>
  <text start="767.67" dur="5.92">instead what what ended up happening was</text>
  <text start="770.94" dur="6.64">my helping him only made it worse</text>
  <text start="773.59" dur="5.64">okay there was actually a time there</text>
  <text start="777.58" dur="3.33">when he was smoking a lot of pot and he</text>
  <text start="779.23" dur="3.96">stopped doing the heroin but it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="6.69">last when he ran out of pot he got back</text>
  <text start="783.19" dur="8.43">on the heroin so I&amp;#39;m going to you know</text>
  <text start="787.6" dur="6.24">I&amp;#39;m going to suggest maybe consider that</text>
  <text start="791.62" dur="5.25">sometimes the hard approach the tough</text>
  <text start="793.84" dur="5.3">love approach the you won&amp;#39;t be part of</text>
  <text start="796.87" dur="4.31">my life and I will not support you own</text>
  <text start="799.14" dur="5.639">give you a damn thing until you change</text>
  <text start="801.18" dur="6.719">this about yourself approach is perhaps</text>
  <text start="804.779" dur="5.731">the most effective way to help people</text>
  <text start="807.899" dur="6.81">that are on drugs and it&amp;#39;s not from a</text>
  <text start="810.51" dur="6.199">place of hard heartedness or or or</text>
  <text start="814.709" dur="4.351">malice it&amp;#39;s from a place of</text>
  <text start="816.709" dur="3.971">self-protection for one you know keeping</text>
  <text start="819.06" dur="4.08">that door closed so you&amp;#39;re not abused</text>
  <text start="820.68" dur="4.92">and exploited but also from a place of</text>
  <text start="823.14" dur="3.629">logic and reason because they need to</text>
  <text start="825.6" dur="3.21">get off the drug because they need to</text>
  <text start="826.769" dur="3.241">stop because the longer they&amp;#39;re on it</text>
  <text start="828.81" dur="4.44">the worse the damage will be and the</text>
  <text start="830.01" dur="5.699">harder if even possible at all it will</text>
  <text start="833.25" dur="4.05">be to come back I mean why did these</text>
  <text start="835.709" dur="5.341">people why are some people able to go</text>
  <text start="837.3" dur="4.979">into surgery I&amp;#39;ve been in surgery I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="841.05" dur="2.94">been on a ton of morphine and</text>
  <text start="842.279" dur="3.331">painkillers things like that came out</text>
  <text start="843.99" dur="3.539">didn&amp;#39;t have any desire to get on them</text>
  <text start="845.61" dur="3.539">again some people will do the same thing</text>
  <text start="847.529" dur="3.06">and they&amp;#39;ll come out addicts they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="849.149" dur="4.741">come out addicted to heroin and</text>
  <text start="850.589" dur="5.641">painkillers and opioids and a lot of</text>
  <text start="853.89" dur="3.449">them has to do with our childhood for</text>
  <text start="856.23" dur="3.78">sure absolutely</text>
  <text start="857.339" dur="5.131">people have made that comment maybe they</text>
  <text start="860.01" dur="5.189">were they had a bad childhood or some</text>
  <text start="862.47" dur="4.229">people were maybe molested that might</text>
  <text start="865.199" dur="3.091">have happened to my siblings you know I</text>
  <text start="866.699" dur="4.021">at one point I went to live with my</text>
  <text start="868.29" dur="3.69">grandparents on my dad&amp;#39;s side and you</text>
  <text start="870.72" dur="2.67">know I actually feel a little guilt for</text>
  <text start="871.98" dur="5.07">that because I feel like I had abandoned</text>
  <text start="873.39" dur="5.189">them but obviously is the oldest I was</text>
  <text start="877.05" dur="6.36">kind of there before things got really</text>
  <text start="878.579" dur="6.781">bad and the effect on children often is</text>
  <text start="883.41" dur="3.869">that their brains no longer make enough</text>
  <text start="885.36" dur="3.75">of the hormone to keep them in an</text>
  <text start="887.279" dur="3.571">emotionally stable happy place they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="889.11" dur="4.05">there it&amp;#39;s almost impossible for them to</text>
  <text start="890.85" dur="4.89">be happy and when they start taking</text>
  <text start="893.16" dur="4.2">these drugs it boosts them back up to</text>
  <text start="895.74" dur="3.15">like a normal level like they feel like</text>
  <text start="897.36" dur="3.51">a normal person they actually have</text>
  <text start="898.89" dur="5.28">normal levels of the chemical in their</text>
  <text start="900.87" dur="8.7">brain but it&amp;#39;s temporary and it has you</text>
  <text start="904.17" dur="6.599">know declining effect over time they get</text>
  <text start="909.57" dur="3.48">less and less of it and eventually</text>
  <text start="910.769" dur="3.991">becomes just a maintenance and then you</text>
  <text start="913.05" dur="3.479">can&amp;#39;t even get you can&amp;#39;t even get to</text>
  <text start="914.76" dur="4.769">that high anymore you you just trying to</text>
  <text start="916.529" dur="5.401">not get too low again and this is why</text>
  <text start="919.529" dur="5.571">certain people become very addicted to</text>
  <text start="921.93" dur="3.17">things and certain people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="926.02" dur="4.71">so it&amp;#39;s very difficult to get off drugs</text>
  <text start="928.85" dur="4.32">if you&amp;#39;re one of those people for sure</text>
  <text start="930.73" dur="4.72">it is very difficult I mean I have a</text>
  <text start="933.17" dur="5.04">have a sugar addiction like I&amp;#39;m having</text>
  <text start="935.45" dur="5.25">trouble with sugar for sure and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="938.21" dur="5.64">tough to stop absolutely and I consider</text>
  <text start="940.7" dur="5.61">myself a pretty strong-willed person so</text>
  <text start="943.85" dur="4.71">I understand that it&amp;#39;s tough that is why</text>
  <text start="946.31" dur="4.83">you have to put them in such a place</text>
  <text start="948.56" dur="5.76">where the alternative is just so dark</text>
  <text start="951.14" dur="4.47">and so hard that it becomes easier and</text>
  <text start="954.32" dur="3.72">easier and easier to make the right</text>

  <text start="1900.509" dur="6.87">sanctity and degradation and we have to</text>
  <text start="1903.359" dur="8.491">understand we can be contaminated by the</text>
