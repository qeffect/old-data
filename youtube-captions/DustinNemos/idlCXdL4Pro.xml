  <text start="3.3" dur="5.37">Mouse of Destiny Mouse calm and real</text>
  <text start="5.819" dur="4.53">briefly there&amp;#39;s packaging it&amp;#39;s yes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="8.67" dur="2.969">midnight but there&amp;#39;s packaging and stuff</text>
  <text start="10.349" dur="3.991">in the background you may hear noises</text>
  <text start="11.639" dur="5.671">but I heard some complaints and issues</text>
  <text start="14.34" dur="4.89">and some confusion and questions and I</text>
  <text start="17.31" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t think this is one that anyone has</text>
  <text start="19.23" dur="4.5">answered I don&amp;#39;t I certainly haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="21.24" dur="5.369">answered this one yet around the</text>
  <text start="23.73" dur="8.52">difference between coconut and olive oil</text>
  <text start="26.609" dur="7.921">c60 so the there&amp;#39;s a Puritan argument</text>
  <text start="32.25" dur="4.41">and there&amp;#39;s a practical argument here</text>
  <text start="34.53" dur="4.619">neither are necessarily right or wrong</text>
  <text start="36.66" dur="4.53">the Puritan argument is the original</text>
  <text start="39.149" dur="4.621">study was done with olive oil and olive</text>
  <text start="41.19" dur="5.4">oil is known itself to be very highly</text>
  <text start="43.77" dur="4.92">beneficial to longevity I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.59" dur="3.449">about like a 30% boost to longevity if</text>
  <text start="48.69" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re taking a lot of olive</text>
  <text start="50.039" dur="4.141">oil in but it has to be the right stuff</text>
  <text start="51.84" dur="4.98">and 95% of that stuff is rancid that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="54.18" dur="4.62">why I use only certain brands the one I</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="4.079">like the most is California olive branch</text>
  <text start="58.8" dur="3.3">if you can get them they were hurt by</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="4.111">the fires they&amp;#39;re getting more expensive</text>
  <text start="62.1" dur="6.3">for that branch now in some cases I</text>
  <text start="65.01" dur="5.25">can&amp;#39;t even get that so but you know</text>
  <text start="68.4" dur="3.84">olive oil is great it&amp;#39;s good for your</text>
  <text start="70.26" dur="4.44">health you can get the good stuff no</text>
  <text start="72.24" dur="4.47">arguments there the real stuff is gonna</text>
  <text start="74.7" dur="4.8">be even the mild stuff is gonna be spicy</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="6.449">it&amp;#39;s gonna be kind of hard on the throat</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="5.25">by itself unless you like spicy I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="4.111">like it that kind of spicy it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="6">a thick and oily spicy I like a mild</text>
  <text start="87.27" dur="6.059">spicy eating but not that anyway so I</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="5.25">had an interruption there um so I was</text>
  <text start="93.329" dur="5.911">basically saying that depending on your</text>
  <text start="96" dur="6.299">your target you know olive oil may taste</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="6.629">a little bit too strong now on the other</text>
  <text start="102.299" dur="6.451">hand coconut oil very mild even a little</text>
  <text start="105.869" dur="5.07">bit sweet and it&amp;#39;s good for cooking even</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="5.159">if you heat it not a problem you can</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="4.14">actually heat it and then you know throw</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="2.431">it back in the fridge or something and</text>
  <text start="115.079" dur="3.451">like heating it up doesn&amp;#39;t actually make</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="4.529">it go bad like it would with olive oil</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="4.589">or many other cooking oils that people</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="3.091">don&amp;#39;t realize you&amp;#39;re cooking it up</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="2.64">you&amp;#39;re destroying it you&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="5.579">turning it unhealthy even if it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="6.151">olive oil so there are some other things</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="3.991">to take into consideration now the real</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="4.2">thing here I think</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="3.96">and I&amp;#39;m not a scientist you know but the</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="2.94">really you don&amp;#39;t have to be a scientist</text>
  <text start="137.49" dur="3.72">to read some of the scientific studies</text>
  <text start="139.05" dur="4.62">and such now I think the practical</text>
  <text start="141.21" dur="3.84">argument and I do understand the purist</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="3.12">argument that&amp;#39;s what they did with the</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="5.67">rat studies you know follow it to the</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="7.38">tea I get that on the other hand we know</text>
  <text start="150.72" dur="6.75">the way c60 works I mean c60 would be</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="5.52">toxic if not bound in a lipid or fat</text>
  <text start="157.47" dur="4.02">cell so that&amp;#39;s why they put it in the</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="3.57">oil that&amp;#39;s why you don&amp;#39;t just rub it in</text>
  <text start="161.49" dur="7.14">your skin with the powder or eat the</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="6.84">powder raw actually in its raw form it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="3.09">actually small enough to go into your</text>
  <text start="170.1" dur="3.3">skin I think about two hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="3.93">of these things will fit across the side</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="4.559">of a piece of you know one grain of sand</text>
  <text start="175.65" dur="3.75">on one side you know so they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="177.959" dur="5.341">tiny they can go throughout your entire</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="5.7">body but if that&amp;#39;s not bound to the oil</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="5.49">as soon as they hit each other they sort</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="5.7">of they want to bind now when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="188.79" dur="3.63">small enough that one or two of them can</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.2">go through everywhere and how big deal</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="3.93">when they start rebinding inside of you</text>
  <text start="195" dur="3.72">and they meet up sometimes and they</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="4.56">rebind into clumps now you have little</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="5.13">free-forming tiny little rocks in your</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="7.1">body everywhere that&amp;#39;s why you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="7.53">want to take it the raw c60 powder form</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="4.78">I&amp;#39;ve had it actually I&amp;#39;ve spilled a</text>
  <text start="211.38" dur="3.78">little bit on me before and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="4.53">have too much of a problem you know I</text>
  <text start="215.16" dur="4.26">could tell I could tell you know</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="3.81">something was a little bit off I could</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="3.75">feel it a little bit and I had a lot</text>
  <text start="221.13" dur="4.71">more energy which could have just been</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="4.5">you know my heart beating faster maybe</text>
  <text start="225.84" dur="4.41">he thought I was poisoned or if there</text>
  <text start="227.67" dur="4.5">was a toxin I don&amp;#39;t know many people</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="3.989">were experimenting and no one was hurt</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="4.7">people were experimenting that to get</text>
  <text start="234.239" dur="6">more energy to do it the wrong way</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="4.869">frankly the way it usually works out is</text>
  <text start="240.239" dur="3.541">that it becomes a little bit more hard</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="3.451">on your your kidneys your body just has</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="3.48">to work a little bit harder to process</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="4.2">those rocks out they don&amp;#39;t perform they</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="5.97">still perform in some level the way you</text>
  <text start="249.39" dur="6.12">would want c60 to perform but they lose</text>
  <text start="253.23" dur="4.41">a lot of that mobility because of the</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="4.08">size and depending on where they are I</text>
  <text start="257.64" dur="4.14">mean that could be a very fact that</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="3.81">could in theory stay with you for a long</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="5.22">time maybe your body can&amp;#39;t move it from</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="3.84">that position I don&amp;#39;t know so there is</text>
  <text start="267" dur="2.91">that</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="5.82">concern you always want to take it done</text>
  <text start="269.91" dur="4.379">professionally you know well done the</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="4.41">right way</text>
  <text start="274.289" dur="4.261">don&amp;#39;t make it the wrong way and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="3.18">that complicated</text>
  <text start="278.55" dur="3.66">you know it&amp;#39;s not like baking it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="280.65" dur="3.299">like cooking it&amp;#39;s a very simple recipe</text>
  <text start="282.21" dur="4.53">that you can follow at home anyone can</text>
  <text start="283.949" dur="4.411">do this but you have to be careful you</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="4.01">have to do the right things otherwise</text>
  <text start="288.36" dur="5.04">you can get some of the the actual</text>
  <text start="290.75" dur="5.949">little tiny rocks built up in you and</text>
  <text start="293.4" dur="5.46">you stretch your kidneys so that&amp;#39;s why a</text>
  <text start="296.699" dur="4.741">lot of people have stopped selling the</text>
  <text start="298.86" dur="4.14">c60 powder of course we ran out the</text>
  <text start="301.44" dur="3.9">industry if you know like I said that</text>
  <text start="303" dur="4.259">myself and others we&amp;#39;ve built it to such</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="5.1">a point where they could not keep up</text>
  <text start="307.259" dur="5.101">production and that&amp;#39;s fine they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="310.44" dur="4.409">to keep up now but many have decided</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="4.17">that we&amp;#39;re gonna cut people off at like</text>
  <text start="314.849" dur="3.271">half a gram a month or something and</text>
  <text start="316.53" dur="4.379">keep it to like the small scale home</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="4.769">reducer because there&amp;#39;s too many people</text>
  <text start="320.909" dur="3.66">getting into this and experimenting</text>
  <text start="322.889" dur="3.631">they&amp;#39;re getting into this they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="324.569" dur="3.361">doing a good job it&amp;#39;s gonna lead like to</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="5.19">some startup companies hurting people</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="6.12">and that&amp;#39;s the fear many other voices I</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="4.56">know Chris over at SES research which is</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="5.7">the like the primary producer of powder</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="5.04">c60 forever and used in most of the</text>
  <text start="339.75" dur="4.139">studies and such</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="4.94">he&amp;#39;s I think he&amp;#39;s also kind of talking</text>
  <text start="343.889" dur="5.52">about this sort of thing with others</text>
  <text start="346.25" dur="4.99">basically just among the the the leaders</text>
  <text start="349.409" dur="5.07">of this community and there&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="5.04">many of us there&amp;#39;s this thought that we</text>
  <text start="354.479" dur="4.56">should get together on some level and</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="5.99">push some sort of like a a conformity of</text>
  <text start="359.039" dur="5.671">standard or something so that there is a</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="4.54">you know sort of a tried and true you</text>
  <text start="364.71" dur="5.31">know this is pure this works isn&amp;#39;t gonna</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="4.68">hurt you because of course people are</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="4.32">selling and I&amp;#39;ve talked about this</text>
  <text start="371.49" dur="4.59">before people are selling some pretty</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="3.99">toxic knockoff stuff I&amp;#39;ve seen I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="4.079">a video about that and and in some cases</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="3.36">they may have the toluene and some of</text>
  <text start="380.159" dur="3.241">the solvent still left and they may have</text>
  <text start="381.69" dur="4.05">just fake stuff in general that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="383.4" dur="4.079">overpriced activated charcoal or</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="4.62">something like that I&amp;#39;ve seen that with</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="4.351">some famous people big brands tons of</text>
  <text start="390.36" dur="5.85">money he&amp;#39;s making on some activated</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="6.72">charcoal that&amp;#39;s $50 a tub like a pound</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="3.8">or two this is 200 ollars a gram for C</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="3.32">60 it&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="400.01" dur="7.29">ball park altogether different effect as</text>
  <text start="401.87" dur="7.8">well no continuing on kind of back to</text>
  <text start="407.3" dur="5.19">the point we&amp;#39;ll go into toxins another</text>
  <text start="409.67" dur="3.99">time and and there&amp;#39;s many reasons that</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="3.39">you should be very careful about who you</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="4.26">shop with c60 from obviously it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="415.88" dur="4.08">breakthrough there is in my opinion I</text>
  <text start="417.92" dur="3.45">think I&amp;#39;m not a medical professional and</text>
  <text start="419.96" dur="3">this is the most exciting thing since</text>
  <text start="421.37" dur="2.82">antibiotics for the history of medicine</text>
  <text start="422.96" dur="2.91">this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="424.19" dur="3.78">yeah I think this is this is the thing</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;ve been looking for like the the pill</text>
  <text start="427.97" dur="3.96">for every ill almost but I can&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="430.22" dur="3.33">make claims or anything but that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="431.93" dur="3.9">opinion because this is the thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="5.31">so easy to take that anyone will take it</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="4.56">usually like juicing and exercise and</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="3.42">all and all that stuff no one&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="440.39" dur="3.18">all that stuff like very few people have</text>
  <text start="442.28" dur="3.69">the willpower to go and actually do that</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="4.5">anyone can take a couple of pills a day</text>
  <text start="445.97" dur="3.63">or a drop a day and I&amp;#39;m probably gonna</text>
  <text start="448.07" dur="5.64">have a pill form at some point not just</text>
  <text start="449.6" dur="5.76">the droppers and stuff but you know kind</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="5.07">of back to the point</text>
  <text start="455.36" dur="6.27">coconut versus olive oil you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="458.78" dur="4.92">gonna get a better total value and olive</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="4.14">oil a little bit more expensive I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="463.7" dur="4.47">consider that in the price when I sell</text>
  <text start="465.77" dur="4.77">my carbon 60 so I just charged by the by</text>
  <text start="468.17" dur="4.11">the ounce of carbon 60 oil so you know</text>
  <text start="470.54" dur="3.03">if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re a value shopper</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="3">you&amp;#39;ll be getting a little bit better</text>
  <text start="473.57" dur="3.6">deal if you&amp;#39;re going for the olive oil I</text>
  <text start="475.28" dur="3.96">nee can mix it with salad to whatever</text>
  <text start="477.17" dur="4.23">you know people just generally eat it</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="3.78">I&amp;#39;ve got a FAQ on my website and a</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="4.92">website and a video about how to do this</text>
  <text start="483.02" dur="4.77">and everything so I still get questions</text>
  <text start="486.32" dur="5.43">sometimes but I&amp;#39;ve got it all there so</text>
  <text start="487.79" dur="7.53">you can see that how to do this um but I</text>
  <text start="491.75" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s my practical opinion that the cause</text>
  <text start="495.32" dur="4.92">of the way that it works the lipid</text>
  <text start="497.72" dur="6.51">having separated these two molecule</text>
  <text start="500.24" dur="6.48">sized little nano carbons then they</text>
  <text start="504.23" dur="4.77">cannot connect it on an electron level</text>
  <text start="506.72" dur="3.51">they can no longer connect and I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="509" dur="4.08">scientist and I don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="510.23" dur="5.97">completely how it works but they are</text>
  <text start="513.08" dur="5.49">unable to bind okay that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.2" dur="5.88">the revolution that&amp;#39;s what made carbon</text>
  <text start="518.57" dur="4.83">60 olive oil famous that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="522.08" dur="3.12">having this discussion right now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.4" dur="3.24">why you&amp;#39;re watching this video because</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s the buzz that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="526.64" dur="4.68">exciting right that&amp;#39;s why we sold out</text>
  <text start="529.13" dur="3.99">for two whole months at the end of 2018</text>
  <text start="531.32" dur="3.51">it was amazing and I</text>
  <text start="533.12" dur="3.51">I hated to even have to raise the price</text>
  <text start="534.83" dur="4.83">but it used to be a lot cheaper than it</text>
  <text start="536.63" dur="5.55">is now and we can&amp;#39;t get it there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.8">whole sell I pay the same rates you guys</text>
  <text start="542.18" dur="6.36">pay when I buy my c60 powder most of the</text>
  <text start="544.46" dur="5.49">time it&amp;#39;s hard to get so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="548.54" dur="4.68">the way it is now</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="6.36">on the other hand the coconut oil works</text>
  <text start="553.22" dur="4.83">the same way it&amp;#39;s still a fact still a</text>
  <text start="556.31" dur="3.45">lipid and as you can see from the the</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="2.94">video the image here and I&amp;#39;ve had that</text>
  <text start="559.76" dur="4.14">up for a while you&amp;#39;ve probably already</text>
  <text start="560.99" dur="4.74">digested it the nutrient or in this case</text>
  <text start="563.9" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s not a nutrient this is a little bit</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="3.92">different from most things it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="566.9" dur="4.77">mineral nutrient it&amp;#39;s carbon</text>
  <text start="569.65" dur="3.79">everything&amp;#39;s made of carbon but this is</text>
  <text start="571.67" dur="3.24">a special carbon is confusing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.44" dur="4.08">actually many different fullerenes</text>
  <text start="574.91" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s c70 there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s higher level</text>
  <text start="577.52" dur="3.21">ones that are far more expensive and</text>
  <text start="579.26" dur="3">hard to get so we haven&amp;#39;t figured out</text>
  <text start="580.73" dur="4.859">what they will do yet but they are</text>
  <text start="582.26" dur="5.88">interesting for health and and seem to</text>
  <text start="585.589" dur="4.681">be more powerful exponentially so c70</text>
  <text start="588.14" dur="3">does some really incredible things but</text>
  <text start="590.27" dur="2.16">we&amp;#39;ll get to that because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.14" dur="2.61">incredibly expensive right now and</text>
  <text start="592.43" dur="4.05">actually if you want me to carry that</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;m willing to do so and and we could</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="4.109">try but it and it&amp;#39;s coming down as</text>
  <text start="599.06" dur="3.84">people understand because you can kind</text>
  <text start="600.589" dur="5.671">of the same system can make them all it</text>
  <text start="602.9" dur="5.189">just takes more time so when it&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="3.329">it&amp;#39;s bound to the fat they can&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="608.089" dur="3.481">can&amp;#39;t hook on each other anymore and</text>
  <text start="609.589" dur="3.601">then it becomes safe then you get</text>
  <text start="611.57" dur="6.18">individual fullerenes traveling</text>
  <text start="613.19" dur="7.2">throughout your body moving around and</text>
  <text start="617.75" dur="4.71">that becomes a lot safer it&amp;#39;s just like</text>
  <text start="620.39" dur="3.84">the liposomal vitamins it gets straight</text>
  <text start="622.46" dur="4.56">into your blood go passes your a</text>
  <text start="624.23" dur="4.83">bypasses your your digestive system and</text>
  <text start="627.02" dur="3.75">your stomach acid and all that now the</text>
  <text start="629.06" dur="4.38">difference between a liposomal vitamin</text>
  <text start="630.77" dur="4.44">and a lipo fullerene is that your</text>
  <text start="633.44" dur="4.47">stomach acids not going to destroy most</text>
  <text start="635.21" dur="3.93">likely a fullerene in the first place</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="4.049">you don&amp;#39;t really need it for that</text>
  <text start="639.14" dur="5.46">purpose it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not to protect the the</text>
  <text start="641.959" dur="5.371">fragile little fullerene from your big</text>
  <text start="644.6" dur="4.739">bad stomach acid this one is to protect</text>
  <text start="647.33" dur="4.59">you from the fullerenes connecting to</text>
  <text start="649.339" dur="4.551">each other that is the discovery that</text>
  <text start="651.92" dur="4.77">made it popular because like I said</text>
  <text start="653.89" dur="4.569">before this has been around for a while</text>
  <text start="656.69" dur="3.69">this this fluorine stuff it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="658.459" dur="4.38">used in many different areas in fact</text>
  <text start="660.38" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s used as an industrial lubricant</text>
  <text start="662.839" dur="3.901">best in class I think so it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="665.42" dur="2.76">really good at</text>
  <text start="666.74" dur="2.58">so maybe people could use it for</text>
  <text start="668.18" dur="2.85">different things in the future I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="669.32" dur="3.72">know for like kneecap replacement who</text>
  <text start="671.03" dur="3.72">knows right or whatever they do where</text>
  <text start="673.04" dur="3.51">they like you have to replace the you</text>
  <text start="674.75" dur="5.52">know the icky stuff inside that makes</text>
  <text start="676.55" dur="8.55">you move I forget the word for that I</text>
  <text start="680.27" dur="6.27">took this in math class anyway I will</text>
  <text start="685.1" dur="3.06">see you guys on the next one I think I</text>
  <text start="686.54" dur="3.57">kind of covered everything I just wanted</text>
  <text start="688.16" dur="3.75">to kind of put to rest like coconut</text>
  <text start="690.11" dur="3.89">versus Olive Oil versus whatever else</text>
  <text start="691.91" dur="4.86">like avocado or anything else obviously</text>
  <text start="694" dur="5.44">quality oils are to be recommended</text>
  <text start="696.77" dur="5.1">organic and and source your stuff really</text>
  <text start="699.44" dur="4.05">well if you&amp;#39;re doing DIY and and make</text>
  <text start="701.87" dur="5.52">sure you&amp;#39;ve got this whole process</text>
  <text start="703.49" dur="6.51">figured out and if you are doing DIY on</text>
  <text start="707.39" dur="4.86">Apex health not Club I do have a list of</text>
  <text start="710" dur="5.4">suggested products and on there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="712.25" dur="6.06">a pretty good ultrasonic cleaner it has</text>
  <text start="715.4" dur="4.74">the right frequency it&amp;#39;s it has a pretty</text>
  <text start="718.31" dur="4.26">good capacity for the home user I mean</text>
  <text start="720.14" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;d have enough to give away and you</text>
  <text start="722.57" dur="4.05">can actually do a pretty good job with</text>
  <text start="724.88" dur="3.15">just that little machine it&amp;#39;s a small</text>
  <text start="726.62" dur="5.16">investment you&amp;#39;ll save a lot of money</text>
  <text start="728.03" dur="5.22">making your c16 that way if you can get</text>
  <text start="731.78" dur="6">the powder that&amp;#39;s still a little bit of</text>
  <text start="733.25" dur="6.15">an issue but that is it&amp;#39;s not too bad</text>
  <text start="737.78" dur="7.29">and a lot of people like the the</text>
  <text start="739.4" dur="7.5">sonication method I like to do both I</text>
  <text start="745.07" dur="4.77">like to do the sonication method and</text>
  <text start="746.9" dur="5.22">then I like to do the magnetic stirrer</text>
  <text start="749.84" dur="4.68">method where it&amp;#39;s kind of like a blender</text>
  <text start="752.12" dur="4.38">but it&amp;#39;s like a lab lab version where</text>
  <text start="754.52" dur="3.63">you don&amp;#39;t actually have to to turn it</text>
  <text start="756.5" dur="3.21">off or it&amp;#39;ll burn out so it just runs</text>
  <text start="758.15" dur="3.21">for weeks at a time and you have a</text>
  <text start="759.71" dur="3.33">magnet inside and then you set the</text>
  <text start="761.36" dur="3.93">beaker down on top you can&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="763.04" dur="4.14">see my hands you set the beaker on top</text>
  <text start="765.29" dur="4.05">of just a flat magnet plate that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="767.18" dur="5.37">spinning inside and you drop a little</text>
  <text start="769.34" dur="6.18">magnet down inside that spins and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="772.55" dur="4.74">actually sort of a low friction way of</text>
  <text start="775.52" dur="3.18">blending and stirring over a long period</text>
  <text start="777.29" dur="3.08">of time without burning out a blender</text>
  <text start="778.7" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s kind of a neat little invention</text>
  <text start="780.37" dur="4.36">before I yeah I had seen him before on</text>
