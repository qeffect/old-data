  <text start="20.18" dur="3.21">daily Magga and queueing on update</text>
  <text start="22.01" dur="4.79">there&amp;#39;s not too much it&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="23.39" dur="8.04">quick video you may hear some dog noises</text>
  <text start="26.8" dur="6.04">anyway let&amp;#39;s jump right in the first bit</text>
  <text start="31.43" dur="2.76">of news is actually pretty terrible</text>
  <text start="32.84" dur="6.149">especially when they have my daughter in</text>
  <text start="34.19" dur="6.45">my arms baby Alfie in the UK hospital as</text>
  <text start="38.989" dur="4.71">many of you who were following that case</text>
  <text start="40.64" dur="5.849">know the government basically pulled the</text>
  <text start="43.699" dur="5.881">plug on the child ordered the kid to be</text>
  <text start="46.489" dur="7.53">killed and then expected that the baby</text>
  <text start="49.58" dur="6.869">would die peacefully painlessly within a</text>
  <text start="54.019" dur="4.411">15-minute period turns out the baby</text>
  <text start="56.449" dur="5.851">survived for four days and starve to</text>
  <text start="58.43" dur="4.979">death that is the end result and not the</text>
  <text start="62.3" dur="4.109">first time this kind of thing has</text>
  <text start="63.409" dur="4.381">happened of socialized health care we</text>
  <text start="66.409" dur="3.601">have to do a better job of taking care</text>
  <text start="67.79" dur="2.93">of our little ones and not trust it to</text>
  <text start="70.01" dur="3.27">the government</text>
  <text start="70.72" dur="5.95">his government just gives everything bad</text>
  <text start="73.28" dur="4.86">quality anyway the death panels</text>
  <text start="76.67" dur="3.72">basically that&amp;#39;s what that is</text>
  <text start="78.14" dur="5.729">not worth it to keep them alive not</text>
  <text start="80.39" dur="8.339">worth it to give them a chance Kanye</text>
  <text start="83.869" dur="7.29">West Daily Caller article says rap star</text>

  <text start="115.1" dur="5.64">decision to support me mega hat in a</text>
  <text start="118.13" dur="4.919">photo posted on Twitter so this is a</text>
  <text start="120.74" dur="3.72">really big cultural thing so Kanye is</text>
  <text start="123.049" dur="4.441">sticking with the fight he&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="124.46" dur="6.99">going to to general this thing he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="127.49" dur="5.76">just a one time says something and then</text>
  <text start="131.45" dur="3.3">backed off when when everybody attacked</text>
  <text start="133.25" dur="4.56">him like that other guy chance the</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="5.069">rapper did and he&amp;#39;s sticking with it on</text>
  <text start="137.81" dur="4.53">the other hand he&amp;#39;s not really that woke</text>
  <text start="139.819" dur="4.741">yet because he also shaved his head in</text>

  <text start="144.56" dur="3.67">school shooting</text>
  <text start="146.13" dur="5.19">who&amp;#39;s trying to take our guns from us so</text>
  <text start="148.23" dur="5.13">you know a little bit of a disheartening</text>
  <text start="151.32" dur="6.39">thing there I really hoped Kanye was</text>
  <text start="153.36" dur="6.57">full whoa you know I&amp;#39;d also heard that</text>
  <text start="157.71" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s just trolling though the left but</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="6.3">that makes no sense as if right now oh</text>

  <text start="166.23" dur="7.74">she&amp;#39;s coughing and congested and no fun</text>
  <text start="169.47" dur="8.64">but she&amp;#39;s got good spirits Trump replied</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="6.39">to tester and said not directly but he</text>
  <text start="178.11" dur="4.26">said I know things about tester that I</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="6.12">could say to and if I set him he&amp;#39;d never</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="5.22">be elected again so probably some dirt</text>

  <text start="191.7" dur="6.42">rumors the the guy that was getting</text>
  <text start="194.85" dur="6.06">appointed to run the VA and then today I</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="5.25">see images from a VA room where the</text>
  <text start="200.91" dur="5.13">hospital is splattered and in looks like</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="4.86">white chemicals or bodily fluids or</text>
  <text start="206.04" dur="3.9">something all over the sink the trash</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="4.59">hadn&amp;#39;t hadn&amp;#39;t been taken out and is</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="4.89">overflowing just this is a room that</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re actually seeing patients in and</text>
  <text start="214.83" dur="3">one of the patients snapped a picture</text>
  <text start="216" dur="4.53">because it&amp;#39;s just not hygienic it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.83" dur="4.88">disgusting I mean if you&amp;#39;re like me you</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="4.32">already know hospitals are pretty</text>
  <text start="222.71" dur="4.45">disgusting and filled with the germs</text>
  <text start="224.85" dur="6.24">anyway they were actually really unclean</text>
  <text start="227.16" dur="6.21">places but this was overt this was</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="6.48">definitely not germ level hidden this</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="8.16">was just bad housekeeping for days not</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="5.7">cleaning your room kind of bad quality I</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="3.36">wish I had safe the picture to show you</text>

  <text start="261.87" dur="6">the queue and unstuff you&amp;#39;re that</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="7.62">breathing you might not be able to hear</text>
  <text start="267.87" dur="11.49">it it&amp;#39;s cute so we are going to start</text>
  <text start="272.07" dur="10.08">off with the post 1292 here after it</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="4.53">said increased chatter about Mueller</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="6.09">already confused attempts to contact a</text>

  <text start="292.26" dur="8.12">know that we know you know what we have</text>
  <text start="296.13" dur="7.8">your move Q so that&amp;#39;s obviously a taunt</text>
  <text start="300.38" dur="6.34">Hugh has spoken before about how their</text>
  <text start="303.93" dur="5.7">goal is to sort of push the enemy</text>
  <text start="306.72" dur="5.22">through fear into making mistakes so</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="4.23">again Q is taunting them prodding them</text>
  <text start="311.94" dur="7.86">in the right direction according to the</text>
  <text start="313.86" dur="7.26">plan might 1293 noted IP ghosts I think</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="7.13">that is something internally I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="7.799">know what that would mean and 1294</text>
  <text start="326.93" dur="4.27">someone talks about how people are</text>
  <text start="328.919" dur="6.031">spreading queueing on messages across</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="5.79">different gatherings and events Q says</text>
  <text start="334.95" dur="5.219">Godspeed Patriots stay strong stay</text>
  <text start="336.99" dur="4.95">united we a boom week ahead so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="340.169" dur="5.041">gonna have another big boom week and</text>
  <text start="341.94" dur="4.47">then from today 1295 here and this is</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="2.85">this is an interesting one I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="5.34">address this from a personal standpoint</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="6.06">as well he says be careful who you are</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="3.99">following absolutely I agree there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="354.12" dur="3.66">lot of disinformation there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="355.74" dur="5.179">misinformation some of its intentional</text>
  <text start="357.78" dur="4.77">some of its just differing opinions</text>
  <text start="360.919" dur="3.451">seeing things from a different</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="5.91">perspective you know I&amp;#39;ve been on the</text>
  <text start="364.37" dur="6.27">tightest frost show before we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="5.07">you know an interview not long ago and</text>
  <text start="370.64" dur="5.5">we have completely different views on Q</text>
  <text start="373.53" dur="4.56">and on but I still like the guy he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.14" dur="4.41">actually voluntarist as well actually I</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="4.14">like the dialogue and some of his</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="6.96">perspectives are interesting you know it</text>
  <text start="382.23" dur="6.719">gives me a better chance to compare my</text>
  <text start="387.51" dur="3.48">own perspective and maybe learn</text>
  <text start="388.949" dur="5.101">something new when I go outside of my</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="5.94">echo chamber so be careful who you are</text>
  <text start="394.05" dur="4.89">following for sure then he continues on</text>
  <text start="396.93" dur="6.15">and says some are profiting off this</text>
  <text start="398.94" dur="5.82">movement now let me read the next line</text>
  <text start="403.08" dur="3.51">as well some are building a big</text>
  <text start="404.76" dur="4.86">following office movement only then to</text>
  <text start="406.59" dur="5.69">retreat and go mainstream Patriots make</text>
  <text start="409.62" dur="6.48">sacrifices some the ultimate sacrifice</text>
  <text start="412.28" dur="6.85">Patriots are selfless do they ask for</text>
  <text start="416.1" dur="5.7">money for monthly payments to remain</text>
  <text start="419.13" dur="5.82">Patriots okay so I&amp;#39;m going to address</text>
  <text start="421.8" dur="5.04">this because I am someone who it could</text>
  <text start="424.95" dur="4.08">be said I mean I don&amp;#39;t ask for money I I</text>
  <text start="426.84" dur="5.4">I say if you believe that this is a</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="5.4">value choose to support it if you want</text>
  <text start="432.24" dur="3.54">because I&amp;#39;m a free-market person and I</text>
  <text start="434.43" dur="3.87">believe that you you vote with your</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="4.05">dollars and if this is a value and you</text>
  <text start="438.3" dur="3.78">support it then I can keep doing it I</text>
  <text start="439.83" dur="4.589">can still afford to to take care of my</text>
  <text start="442.08" dur="4.44">family and fulfill my obligations there</text>
  <text start="444.419" dur="4.5">but then also bring you guys this</text>
  <text start="446.52" dur="4.41">information condense all the news down</text>
  <text start="448.919" dur="4.291">from a queue and on truth or perspective</text>
  <text start="450.93" dur="5.91">you know what I do</text>
  <text start="453.21" dur="5.579">I definitely don&amp;#39;t consider it selfless</text>
  <text start="456.84" dur="4.68">I would continue to do this for free</text>
  <text start="458.789" dur="4.88">given the chance and I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="4.44">start charging for the information</text>
  <text start="463.669" dur="5.071">everybody that donates money to me so</text>
  <text start="465.96" dur="5.34">far it&amp;#39;s 100% donations it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="468.74" dur="4.179">because people want this information</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="3.54">they want me to keep doing this and and</text>
  <text start="472.919" dur="7.351">you guys are great I greatly appreciate</text>
  <text start="474.84" dur="8.34">that but it&amp;#39;s not completely selfless I</text>
  <text start="480.27" dur="4.8">do have a family you know so so there is</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="4.29">that and I think the queue kind of puts</text>
  <text start="485.07" dur="4.319">some of us in an awkward position here I</text>
  <text start="487.47" dur="3.6">think this could potentially frame us in</text>
  <text start="489.389" dur="4.25">a bad light I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think he</text>
  <text start="491.07" dur="4.68">intentionally means me necessarily but</text>
  <text start="493.639" dur="5.65">there are people out there that maybe</text>
  <text start="495.75" dur="5.7">are just trying to profit off us as far</text>
  <text start="499.289" dur="5.581">as going mainstream I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="501.45" dur="5.01">you can build a big following off of the</text>
  <text start="504.87" dur="2.97">things that I&amp;#39;ve talked about like pedo</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="4.41">gate and Clinton and</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="4.92">and some of the things that I discuss on</text>
  <text start="510.87" dur="3.51">the channel like false flags I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="4.92">think there&amp;#39;s anywhere in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="4.95">for that kind of person ever so you</text>
  <text start="517.68" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t have to worry about me cutting and</text>
  <text start="519.33" dur="5.46">going mainstream I won&amp;#39;t turn into one</text>
  <text start="522" dur="5.7">of the Talking Heads those videos clips</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="4.77">from when I said false flags way back</text>
  <text start="527.7" dur="3.9">when would always be held over my head</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="2.969">or would prevent me from getting that</text>
  <text start="531.6" dur="2.489">kind of work anyway</text>
  <text start="532.529" dur="3.06">and that&amp;#39;s completely fine because</text>
  <text start="534.089" dur="4.081">they&amp;#39;re the truth and I talk about the</text>
  <text start="535.589" dur="8.431">truth and I don&amp;#39;t care whose feelings it</text>
  <text start="538.17" dur="7.56">hurts as for the rest of this</text>
  <text start="544.02" dur="3.42">I think logically to some it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="545.73" dur="3.33">about money I&amp;#39;ll leave it to you guys to</text>
  <text start="547.44" dur="3.75">make up your own decision as to whether</text>
  <text start="549.06" dur="4.65">or not you think I do this just for</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="4.649">money hopefully you know me better than</text>
  <text start="553.71" dur="3.42">that but nothing I say will change your</text>
  <text start="555.839" dur="5.071">mind if you think about in that kind of</text>
  <text start="557.13" dur="8.399">person so that&amp;#39;s completely on you to</text>
  <text start="560.91" dur="6.869">make that decision those who would seek</text>
  <text start="565.529" dur="5.701">personal gain at the expense of others</text>
  <text start="567.779" dur="8.841">in this movement has an agenda I could</text>
  <text start="571.23" dur="8.07">agree with that I don&amp;#39;t necessarily see</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="6.25">the situation where people support</text>
  <text start="579.3" dur="4.95">independent journalism so that they have</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="4.56">that option I mean if you don&amp;#39;t support</text>
  <text start="584.25" dur="4.709">it it drives up it does take money to</text>
  <text start="587.43" dur="2.7">live and journalists need money to and</text>
  <text start="588.959" dur="3.961">unfortunately they often end up being</text>
  <text start="590.13" dur="4.29">the poorest among us when they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="592.92" dur="4.35">to get the truth out and in some cases</text>
  <text start="594.42" dur="5.76">risking their lives for the opportunity</text>
  <text start="597.27" dur="5.25">to be poor just because they believe in</text>
  <text start="600.18" dur="5.159">the truth that much so if you&amp;#39;re if</text>
  <text start="602.52" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re just out to get personal gain at</text>
  <text start="605.339" dur="3.181">the expense of others that&amp;#39;s immoral if</text>
  <text start="607.08" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re doing it in a win-win situation</text>
  <text start="608.52" dur="4.95">where you&amp;#39;re giving information and</text>
  <text start="611.1" dur="4.95">people are supporting you for that I</text>
  <text start="613.47" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t see a problem with that q then</text>
  <text start="616.05" dur="3.9">says you decide</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="6.42">I completely agree you decide you have</text>
  <text start="619.95" dur="6.81">to pick the kind of people who have the</text>
  <text start="624.18" dur="5.72">same same sort of values that you do so</text>
  <text start="626.76" dur="3.14">if you want to pick people who</text>
  <text start="630.49" dur="4.68">do not share your values in any</text>
  <text start="633.1" dur="3.6">situation on just in this alternative</text>
  <text start="635.17" dur="4.23">journalism situation but in any</text>
  <text start="636.7" dur="5.61">situation whatever you fund you you</text>
  <text start="639.4" dur="5.04">create more of you if you subsidize</text>
  <text start="642.31" dur="4.65">something or profit something in this</text>
