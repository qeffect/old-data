  <text start="107.04" dur="5.73">mixed it in my paint when I painted this</text>
  <text start="110.009" dur="5.581">new apartment and I painted basically</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="4.139">the exterior walls I painted like the</text>

  <text start="135.15" dur="3.78">extrapolate that the powder works like</text>
  <text start="137.04" dur="3.33">the solid which I think it does and I</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="3.63">haven&amp;#39;t tested this with an EMF meter</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="4.02">because they&amp;#39;re the nice ones that test</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="2.94">for like smart meter radiation are very</text>
  <text start="144.39" dur="4.23">expensive</text>
  <text start="145.5" dur="5.7">someone did very graciously offered to</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="4.53">to ship me theirs and let me use it and</text>
  <text start="151.2" dur="3.3">send it back and I haven&amp;#39;t heard back</text>
  <text start="153.15" dur="3.9">about that and hopefully that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="4.26">something I can show you guys soon but I</text>
  <text start="157.05" dur="3.48">just wanted to mention this because this</text>
  <text start="158.76" dur="4.05">is a solution and this stuff is rolling</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="3.929">out okay your desk ornaments they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="4.32">cool they&amp;#39;re on Amazon you can get these</text>
  <text start="164.459" dur="3.661">if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re well off and you</text>
  <text start="167.13" dur="3.09">want to get something just a little</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="3.929">nicer they actually have one that looks</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="3.72">like a really pretty silver version and</text>
  <text start="172.049" dur="4.171">that&amp;#39;s called elite young guide which is</text>
  <text start="173.94" dur="4.049">like a more concentrated version but as</text>
  <text start="176.22" dur="3.48">you could tell any cheap old Shung guide</text>
  <text start="177.989" dur="4.11">is gonna do a lot for your radiation</text>
  <text start="179.7" dur="4.53">okay look at what it just did for that</text>
  <text start="182.099" dur="4.261">microwave okay and you know microwaves</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="3.839">are a big source of it ironically</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;ve banned microwaves in Russia last</text>
  <text start="188.069" dur="4.261">I checked so I guess they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="190.47" dur="2.91">pretty smart in terms of health stuff I</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="4.26">mean they they&amp;#39;re one of the largest</text>
  <text start="193.38" dur="5.21">exporters organic food now and and and</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="5.16">they understand GMO and they understand</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="5.2">apparently they understand shunga pretty</text>
  <text start="201.75" dur="3.81">well so it&amp;#39;s kind of an interesting</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="3.72">little thing from nature that helps to</text>
  <text start="205.56" dur="4.2">protect us once again nature usually</text>

  <text start="222.6" dur="3.99">about holistic health so this is sort of</text>
  <text start="224.819" dur="3.181">a three-in-one for me and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="2.729">exciting and it&amp;#39;s very cheap and it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="233.28" dur="4.92">out right ahead of the 5g wave and and</text>
  <text start="236.04" dur="4.68">hopefully it&amp;#39;ll help us now</text>
  <text start="238.2" dur="4.74">some of the effects of the 5g are going</text>
  <text start="240.72" dur="4.44">to be you know a lot of cataracts a lot</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="4.019">of you know what I&amp;#39;m hearing a lot of</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="5.159">damage to the external layers of your</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="5.041">skin I don&amp;#39;t think it penetrates super</text>
  <text start="250.319" dur="3.661">well into your skin your internal organs</text>
  <text start="252" dur="4.079">and stuff but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="260.97" dur="4.4">and I backed you know that once we see</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="3.29">the real role</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="5.22">five G across the place across the world</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s gonna get bad now what happens when</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="3.48">they launch those ten thousand</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="3.48">satellites that they&amp;#39;re gonna beam down</text>
  <text start="274.07" dur="3.68">five G to every square inch of the</text>
  <text start="275.6" dur="4.71">planet with what are you gonna do then</text>
  <text start="277.75" dur="5.68">okay so in theory you could use this for</text>
  <text start="280.31" dur="4.59">a vehicle I somebody even sent me a</text>
  <text start="283.43" dur="3.6">picture where they had put young light</text>

  <text start="372.62" dur="4.38">okay and if you paid attention to that</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="6.14">video that&amp;#39;s basically what you need</text>
  <text start="377" dur="6.389">right there now it is not 100% foolproof</text>
  <text start="381.16" dur="3.879">that this is going to protect your house</text>
  <text start="383.389" dur="3.271">I&amp;#39;m not making any claims anything else</text>
  <text start="385.039" dur="2.91">I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with all the that</text>
  <text start="386.66" dur="3.21">stuff okay I&amp;#39;m just letting you know</text>
  <text start="387.949" dur="4.65">what I found and I&amp;#39;m letting you know</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="4.229">what I&amp;#39;m trying in my life and when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="392.599" dur="4.081">saying it&amp;#39;s not a hundred percent proof</text>
  <text start="394.099" dur="4.051">and the windows and such you know your</text>
  <text start="396.68" dur="2.31">your glass is still going to be an</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="2.1">entryway for</text>
  <text start="398.99" dur="2.52">some of this radiation you know maybe</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="3.71">you&amp;#39;ve got big windows or maybe you got</text>
  <text start="401.51" dur="5.43">windows all over the house whatever</text>
  <text start="403.96" dur="4.12">there is another solution for this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="3.45">a little bit more expensive but you can</text>
  <text start="408.08" dur="3.95">get the UV window treatments which I</text>
  <text start="410.39" dur="4.35">think also really improve your</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="3.94">insulation that might be two different</text>
  <text start="414.74" dur="2.91">kinds of treatments so I could be I</text>
  <text start="415.97" dur="3.24">could be wrong about that but you know</text>
  <text start="417.65" dur="4.17">your windows are a big part of your loss</text>
  <text start="419.21" dur="4.5">of you know hot or cold depending on</text>
  <text start="421.82" dur="4.53">what you&amp;#39;re doing your your energy loss</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s a like 10 20 30 % of it I think</text>
  <text start="426.35" dur="4.89">so this is a great thing that you can do</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="3.45">to prevent the UV rays from coming in if</text>
  <text start="431.24" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re concerned about that</text>
  <text start="432.35" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m not because I need more UV rays but</text>
  <text start="435.17" dur="4.08">you know if you&amp;#39;re concerned about that</text>
  <text start="436.79" dur="3.9">great but this will also these things</text>
  <text start="439.25" dur="3.6">whatever they&amp;#39;re made of will also do a</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="7.08">pretty good job of blocking this thing</text>
  <text start="442.85" dur="6.18">so you know Wi-Fi smart meters 4G 5g any</text>
  <text start="447.77" dur="2.88">of that stuff</text>
  <text start="449.03" dur="3.27">it will attenuate and make the waves</text>
  <text start="450.65" dur="3.03">safer I don&amp;#39;t even think that it blocks</text>
  <text start="452.3" dur="4.11">signal I haven&amp;#39;t had any signal issue</text>
  <text start="453.68" dur="5.13">since I painted signal still seems to</text>
  <text start="456.41" dur="7.44">work it just makes it less harmful on</text>
  <text start="458.81" dur="6.78">some electromagnetic level that&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="463.85" dur="5.79">of what I wanted to talk about with this</text>
  <text start="465.59" dur="6.48">I think 5g and radiation is is a scary</text>
  <text start="469.64" dur="4.05">topic the smart meters are a scary topic</text>
  <text start="472.07" dur="3.9">and you know there&amp;#39;s a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="473.69" dur="4.05">solutions even retail level you can get</text>
  <text start="475.97" dur="3.45">this thing that that just clamps on to</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="3.96">your smart meter outside and and</text>
  <text start="479.42" dur="4.32">protects you from from that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s okay too they have it so that</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="2.73">it&amp;#39;ll fit different types of smart</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="4.23">meters and just fit right on there and</text>
  <text start="486.47" dur="4.29">you can just click it in but rather than</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="3.09">have to buy one of those things there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="4.08">you know there&amp;#39;s options that you can do</text>
  <text start="492.41" dur="3.9">if you don&amp;#39;t want to go and paint your</text>
  <text start="494.84" dur="3.06">entire house and you just have some</text>
  <text start="496.31" dur="4.05">smart meters well my original plan</text>
  <text start="497.9" dur="3.93">before I found out about mixing it with</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="4.56">paint and my head I guess thought about</text>
  <text start="501.83" dur="5.28">it my original plan was to just take a</text>
  <text start="504.92" dur="3.78">large cardboard box something that maybe</text>
  <text start="507.11" dur="5.19">like a furniture box kind of size</text>
  <text start="508.7" dur="5.61">biggest I could get and then mesh the</text>
  <text start="512.3" dur="4.95">two sides of the cardboard of the Box</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="4.53">over some shunga powder and some Elmer&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="3.33">glue and just kind of spread it out</text>
  <text start="518.84" dur="5.31">there like a paste and let it glue down</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="6.27">and then put that on the wall on the</text>
  <text start="524.15" dur="5.64">inside of the house right in front of</text>
  <text start="526.85" dur="5.25">the smart meters because that sort of</text>
  <text start="529.79" dur="2.97">works like a comb shape you know sort of</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="2.64">like the flash</text>
  <text start="532.76" dur="5.16">light if you&amp;#39;re blocking the flashlight</text>
  <text start="534.74" dur="6.42">it&amp;#39;s gonna go around but not through and</text>
  <text start="537.92" dur="4.83">and that is very very helpful on a</text>
  <text start="541.16" dur="3.15">budget you could do that for like ten</text>
  <text start="542.75" dur="3.15">bucks I don&amp;#39;t if you got the box laying</text>
  <text start="544.31" dur="3.66">around some Elmer&amp;#39;s glue and some shunga</text>
  <text start="545.9" dur="4.2">powder that&amp;#39;s a very affordable option</text>
  <text start="547.97" dur="4.35">and imagine you know just look up some</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="4.47">of the you know the videos about smart</text>
  <text start="552.32" dur="4.11">meters like 5g is coming yeah and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="554.57" dur="3.18">in a couple places but smart meters are</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="4.26">here and they&amp;#39;re pretty dangerous as</text>
  <text start="557.75" dur="4.71">well and these companies you know people</text>
  <text start="560.69" dur="3.36">are struggling and fighting to be able</text>
  <text start="562.46" dur="2.7">to keep these things off their homes and</text>
  <text start="564.05" dur="2.19">these companies are still doing it</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="2.37">they&amp;#39;re still pushing it down our</text>
  <text start="566.24" dur="3.63">throats</text>
  <text start="567.53" dur="4.35">definitely definitely immoral and I</text>
  <text start="569.87" dur="3.03">can&amp;#39;t wait till we can decentralize all</text>
  <text start="571.88" dur="3.24">of that stuff and get rid of these</text>
  <text start="572.9" dur="4.56">companies but this is an option this</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="3.45">will help I hope and let me know what</text>
  <text start="577.46" dur="3.24">you think in the comments this is</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="4.02">something I&amp;#39;m rather proud of because I</text>
  <text start="580.7" dur="4.65">think I like I said I&amp;#39;m the first to</text>
  <text start="582.59" dur="5.1">have done this and you know not to not</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="4.65">to stroke my ego or anything but I hope</text>
  <text start="587.69" dur="4.83">they can save possibly thousands of</text>
  <text start="590" dur="5.79">lives maybe millions of victims right</text>
  <text start="592.52" dur="5.28">because this stuff is invisible it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="595.79" dur="4.83">slowly vibrating and cooking your cells</text>
  <text start="597.8" dur="4.2">and and causing them to heat up which</text>
  <text start="600.62" dur="3.36">you know eventually causes them to break</text>
  <text start="602" dur="4.32">down you take causes things like cancers</text>
  <text start="603.98" dur="4.68">and stuff like that you know look you</text>
  <text start="606.32" dur="3.81">look into your research on the Wi-Fi and</text>
  <text start="608.66" dur="2.97">look into your research on the smart</text>
  <text start="610.13" dur="3.33">meters that&amp;#39;s even worse because it does</text>
  <text start="611.63" dur="3.89">the the fast flicker pulse which is</text>
  <text start="613.46" dur="4.38">which is apparently far more harmful</text>
  <text start="615.52" dur="4.03">especially if you&amp;#39;re in a densely</text>
  <text start="617.84" dur="3.27">populated area where there are probably</text>
  <text start="619.55" dur="4.32">dozens of these things affecting you</text>

  <text start="709.67" dur="5.7">myself an electromagnetic radiation</text>
  <text start="712.639" dur="5.361">detector and we have a piece of Shawn</text>

  <text start="729.139" dur="4.231">on it and an easiest way to do it is</text>

  <text start="733.37" dur="5.99">device on you&amp;#39;re going to be reading and</text>
  <text start="736.73" dur="6.359">then as you go closer to the microwave</text>
  <text start="739.36" dur="6.28">and as you can see it goes up and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="743.089" dur="5.19">beeping because it&amp;#39;s obviously an alarm</text>
