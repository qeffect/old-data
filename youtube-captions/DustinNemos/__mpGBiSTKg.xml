  <text start="130.84" dur="4.41">this is just a quick mention I wish this</text>
  <text start="132.73" dur="5.55">was a joke or maybe some sort of satire</text>
  <text start="135.25" dur="5.69">but it&amp;#39;s not even the Washington Post is</text>
  <text start="138.28" dur="5.429">now getting involved in the estrogen</text>
  <text start="140.94" dur="5.17">burger conversation so apparently the</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="5.011">new Burger King burger has so much</text>
  <text start="146.11" dur="4.32">estrogen in it that one veterinarian was</text>
  <text start="148.72" dur="5.43">warning that it could make men grow</text>
  <text start="150.43" dur="6.39">breasts I&amp;#39;ve covered this phenomenon</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="7.02">it&amp;#39;s known as you guys know the B word</text>
  <text start="156.82" dur="6.81">the B itch word tits and that is the</text>
  <text start="161.17" dur="5.25">name that people give it because it</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="4.92">creates a situation where even men will</text>
  <text start="166.42" dur="5.06">grow breasts because of the increased</text>
  <text start="168.55" dur="5.64">soy and that&amp;#39;s a pretty common thing now</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="5.38">especially in America and a lot of guys</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="4.11">have you know discovered it too late</text>
  <text start="176.86" dur="4.56">that it was wrecking their hormones</text>
  <text start="178.3" dur="6.09">their their their maleness their</text>
  <text start="181.42" dur="4.71">virility their energy levels playing</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="4.83">whack with their stress things like that</text>
  <text start="186.13" dur="6.09">not to mention just the embarrassment of</text>
  <text start="189.22" dur="5.4">physical breasts on a man I mean and you</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="4.56">know there are ways to undo this but you</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="3.48">know soy ensuing mimickers are not</text>
  <text start="196.78" dur="3.9">something that should be added or</text>
  <text start="198.1" dur="4.77">I mean so II you know in in a certain</text>
  <text start="200.68" dur="5.49">way and a non-gmo which is hard to get</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="5.28">you know organic soy very impossible to</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="4.41">get in the u.s. almost and then you take</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="4.68">that you culture it you ferment it you</text>
  <text start="210.58" dur="5.37">create a knot or something like that</text>
  <text start="212.83" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s better for you you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="4.2">different types of ways of fermenting</text>
  <text start="217.81" dur="5.55">soy that can make it healthy for you</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="7.29">that can decrease the soy content and</text>
  <text start="223.36" dur="6.45">then can even create like a good</text>
  <text start="227.44" dur="4.86">bacteria benefit like natto is filled</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="4.86">with good bacteria so you know there are</text>
  <text start="232.3" dur="4.08">ways to consume soy in a healthy way but</text>
  <text start="234.67" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s all these different criteria it has</text>
  <text start="236.38" dur="4.77">to be GMO free it has to be organic and</text>
  <text start="238.42" dur="4.98">then of course it has to be cultured if</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="4.98">you take raw soy or things that have soy</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="4.73">in them or you drink soy milk or things</text>
  <text start="246.13" dur="5.13">like that it&amp;#39;s gonna mess with your</text>
  <text start="248.13" dur="6.58">entire body it&amp;#39;s even in fact a brain</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="5.4">toxic chemical and it&amp;#39;s raw unfermented</text>
  <text start="254.71" dur="4.74">form so it&amp;#39;s not even something people</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="5.34">should eat at all whole period you know</text>
  <text start="259.45" dur="5.01">this is something that it&amp;#39;s one of those</text>
  <text start="262" dur="3.6">crazes people got into a food craze and</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="2.61">they started thinking it was really</text>
  <text start="265.6" dur="3.63">healthy for them and they all started to</text>
  <text start="267.07" dur="4.14">follow in on that craze and now soy is</text>
  <text start="269.23" dur="4.86">everywhere it&amp;#39;s in half of the food</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="5.76">products it&amp;#39;s in a lot of the coffees so</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="5.97">a lot ace things like that it&amp;#39;s bad for</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="6.72">you and most of its GMO which is double</text>
  <text start="280.06" dur="5.22">bad for you we also have Russia and the</text>
  <text start="283.69" dur="4.73">central bank in Russia this is a</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="5.55">different beast altogether this is um</text>
  <text start="288.42" dur="4">and frankly the Central Bank of Russia</text>
  <text start="290.83" dur="4.17">is a little different in general because</text>
  <text start="292.42" dur="4.5">they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t take commands from</text>
  <text start="295" dur="3.39">the rest of the central bank&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="296.92" dur="2.97">little bit of a different system they I</text>
  <text start="298.39" dur="3.33">think they even paid off their debt and</text>
  <text start="299.89" dur="3.39">the government basically runs the</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="4.44">central bank instead of the other way</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="4.8">around as best I can tell but anyway so</text>
  <text start="306.16" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;ve already talked about the BRICS</text>
  <text start="308.08" dur="4.08">nations and the Eastern Bloc and</text>
  <text start="310" dur="4.23">especially Russia and China and the</text>
  <text start="312.16" dur="4.65">actions that they&amp;#39;re taking to kind of</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="5.04">work around the u.s. control of the</text>
  <text start="316.81" dur="4.31">entire world economy and of course</text>
  <text start="319.27" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re building an entirely new system</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="7.27">one that is tenting a hinting toward</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="4.74">being gold backed if nothing else</text>
  <text start="328.39" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;ve already been in a trade with</text>
  <text start="330.85" dur="2.28">China</text>
  <text start="331.48" dur="3.96">they will sell oil to China and then</text>
  <text start="333.13" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;ll turn the Chinese you want into</text>
  <text start="335.44" dur="3.6">gold immediately on the Chinese stock</text>
  <text start="337" dur="4.32">market which is in essence trading gold</text>
  <text start="339.04" dur="5.34">for oil these are kind of things that</text>
  <text start="341.32" dur="4.71">are a big threat to the dollar which you</text>
  <text start="344.38" dur="4.38">know all the oil is supposed to be</text>
  <text start="346.03" dur="4.47">backed by the petro dollar deal the US</text>
  <text start="348.76" dur="3.45">reserve dollar and that&amp;#39;s why we had so</text>
  <text start="350.5" dur="5.04">much power because the dollar was backed</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="5.1">by oil that&amp;#39;s no longer the case it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="355.54" dur="5.64">longer pegged to oil there are</text>
  <text start="357.31" dur="6.72">competitors and gold itself is now being</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="5.25">teased as a possible backer or or</text>
  <text start="364.03" dur="3.9">partial backer you know in essence it</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="3.51">would mean the same thing and in a world</text>
  <text start="367.93" dur="6.33">full of little hair on my computer</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;re in a world full of you know fiat</text>
  <text start="374.26" dur="4.07">zero current value currencies out there</text>
  <text start="377.14" dur="3.96">all these different paper money&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="4.9">anything that had a 10% backing buy gold</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="3.69">would be a hundred percent or a thousand</text>
  <text start="383.23" dur="5.1">percent better than the others because</text>
  <text start="384.79" dur="5.7">what is a hundred or ten times zero you</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="4.77">know they they have no value whatsoever</text>
  <text start="390.49" dur="4.74">period so you know it would therefore</text>
  <text start="393.1" dur="5.25">have a lot more value and of course this</text>
  <text start="395.23" dur="4.71">would this would throw currency traders</text>
  <text start="398.35" dur="4.5">it would throw the stock market</text>
  <text start="399.94" dur="4.44">everything eventually for a huge loop so</text>
  <text start="402.85" dur="3.69">this is gonna be very interesting to see</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="4.47">that their central bank is now playing</text>
  <text start="406.54" dur="5.4">around with a gold backed or partially</text>
  <text start="408.85" dur="5.01">gold backed stable coin now what a</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="5.1">stable coin is for those who probably</text>
  <text start="413.86" dur="5.76">just like one stable coin is a type of</text>
  <text start="417.04" dur="6.15">Bitcoin or cryptocurrency alternative</text>
  <text start="419.62" dur="6">that is meant to be stable and it you</text>
  <text start="423.19" dur="4.8">know obviously bitcoin is so new and so</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="4.08">volatile and it&amp;#39;s so well known for</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="3.42">being volatile that it goes up and down</text>
  <text start="429.7" dur="3.78">up and down and that&amp;#39;s not useful for</text>
  <text start="431.41" dur="4.02">everyday trade it would it would make a</text>
  <text start="433.48" dur="4.47">lot of day-to-day business things that</text>
  <text start="435.43" dur="5.91">we take for granted impossible now there</text>
  <text start="437.95" dur="6.45">are experiments with stable coins one is</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="4.26">a coin that was pegged to the dollar I</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t remember the name of the coin off</text>
  <text start="445.6" dur="3.87">the top of my head and I shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="447.55" dur="4.26">advertise it anyway because it&amp;#39;s a scam</text>
  <text start="449.47" dur="4.7">coin but one was pegged to the dollar</text>
  <text start="451.81" dur="5.1">one to one ratio and that&amp;#39;s already had</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="5.29">allegations of you know sketchiness</text>
  <text start="456.91" dur="5.34">going on there and you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="459.46" dur="4.44">other coins that have been suggested or</text>
  <text start="462.25" dur="3.57">floated to be pegged to gold things like</text>
  <text start="463.9" dur="3.06">that in the private sphere</text>
  <text start="465.82" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s all these different ones</text>
  <text start="466.96" dur="3.48">competing in their private sphere and</text>
  <text start="469.06" dur="4.14">many of them are good there are some</text>
  <text start="470.44" dur="4.38">great crypto currencies out there where</text>
  <text start="473.2" dur="4.32">you can be your own bank you can shop</text>
  <text start="474.82" dur="5.07">online more safely and you can store</text>
  <text start="477.52" dur="4.41">your wealth in a way that is password</text>
  <text start="479.89" dur="4.23">protected in your own head so no one can</text>
  <text start="481.93" dur="3.42">ever take it from you by force these are</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="3.77">some very interesting things you can</text>
  <text start="485.35" dur="6.21">even travel with your money in your head</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="5.23">you know escape a burning country and</text>
  <text start="491.56" dur="3.06">flee refugee status to some other</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="3.84">country with a billion dollars in your</text>
  <text start="494.62" dur="4.65">brain in theory so there are some cool</text>
  <text start="496.96" dur="4.02">benefits to having crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="499.27" dur="4.38">even if you&amp;#39;re still a a gold and silver</text>
  <text start="500.98" dur="3.87">bug or even if you still hate crypto</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="3.6">currencies out there you know there</text>
  <text start="504.85" dur="4.35">there are some advantages over a credit</text>
  <text start="507.25" dur="5.039">card for example in terms of security</text>
  <text start="509.2" dur="4.469">speed and price immediately realized so</text>
  <text start="512.289" dur="3.121">it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time until you</text>
  <text start="513.669" dur="3.211">start seeing these and in fact you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="515.41" dur="3.45">already seeing a lot of the biggest</text>
  <text start="516.88" dur="4.83">companies out there shift their back-end</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="6.36">to a block to a blockchain based</text>
  <text start="521.71" dur="5.67">platform now that technology blockchain</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="3.96">is what powers Bitcoin and all the</text>
  <text start="527.38" dur="4.11">others but it&amp;#39;s useful for many</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="4.56">different areas and the blockchain</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="3.84">itself and the crypto currencies are all</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="3.99">taking the world by storm it&amp;#39;s only a</text>
  <text start="535.33" dur="5.4">matter of time so to see a government</text>
  <text start="537.73" dur="5.94">backed at this level you know a major</text>
  <text start="540.73" dur="6.21">economy a major power backing a or</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="5.73">talking about backing a crypto currency</text>
  <text start="546.94" dur="4.62">and I won&amp;#39;t call this a crypto there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="549.4" dur="3.96">difference between digital currencies</text>
  <text start="551.56" dur="6.12">and crypto currencies crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="553.36" dur="6.47">are cryptographically protected the idea</text>
  <text start="557.68" dur="4.29">is to be decentralized</text>
  <text start="559.83" dur="4.24">pierless pairs are peer-to-peer</text>
  <text start="561.97" dur="5.01">trustless systems where you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="564.07" dur="6.42">to trust anyone now a stable coin or a</text>
  <text start="566.98" dur="5.46">digital currency in this case that would</text>
  <text start="570.49" dur="4.29">also be a considered a stable coin</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="4.68">because it&amp;#39;s pegged a digital currency</text>
  <text start="574.78" dur="4.29">in this case is something that you have</text>
  <text start="577.12" dur="5.04">to trust someone you have to trust the</text>
  <text start="579.07" dur="4.8">bank or the government that runs it you</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="3.84">know that&amp;#39;s a problem obviously</text>
  <text start="583.87" dur="4.29">governments and banks are a rife with</text>
  <text start="586" dur="3.9">corruption there&amp;#39;s always risks to</text>
  <text start="588.16" dur="3">having your bank hacked and stolen we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="589.9" dur="3.75">seen that numerous times when you</text>
  <text start="591.16" dur="5.25">centralize even Bitcoin in such like</text>
  <text start="593.65" dur="5.49">that you know mal Cox comes to mind for</text>
  <text start="596.41" dur="4.679">those who are following the industry</text>
