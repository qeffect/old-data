  <text start="338.569" dur="5.85">I&amp;#39;ve been trying to figure out the best</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="6.81">way to get everything that I need an</text>
  <text start="344.419" dur="6.84">affordable form now this one comes with</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="6.989">some toxins this is a zinc not toxins</text>
  <text start="351.259" dur="4.921">but some toxicity warnings a little bit</text>
  <text start="354.349" dur="5.46">of zinc is all you need like very very</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="4.919">little one milligram one to three times</text>
  <text start="359.809" dur="2.88">a day now the older you get the more</text>
  <text start="361.099" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;ll need things like that of course</text>
  <text start="362.689" dur="5.551">but it does not take much does he get</text>
  <text start="365.209" dur="5.46">all in too much pretty dangerous so you</text>
  <text start="368.24" dur="3.929">know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t do a lot but most</text>
  <text start="370.669" dur="4.73">people are deficient so I just want to</text>
  <text start="372.169" dur="3.23">make sure that I get some zinc</text>
  <text start="377.93" dur="7.019">I told you guys I was pretty serious</text>
  <text start="379.699" dur="6.871">about this health stuff these are my are</text>
  <text start="384.949" dur="4.141">some of my nootropics</text>
  <text start="386.57" dur="4.83">this is not something that&amp;#39;s like health</text>
  <text start="389.09" dur="4.199">necessarily although they do have some</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="5.4">promising results in terms of</text>
  <text start="393.289" dur="6.38">neuroprotective things to them you know</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="7.11">effects but these are more of a</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="6.22">biohacking the goal here is to try to</text>
  <text start="403.91" dur="4.349">improve memory improve learning capacity</text>
  <text start="405.889" dur="3.691">improve mental function one of them that</text>
  <text start="408.259" dur="4.081">i use one of the most powerful ones in</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="4.89">the market is a new pet</text>
  <text start="412.34" dur="5.82">i&amp;#39;m actually curious to see if this one</text>
  <text start="414.47" dur="6.289">can be made liposomal because it should</text>
  <text start="418.16" dur="5.64">be doable but then that would require</text>
  <text start="420.759" dur="4.901">experimentation with dosages things like</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="3.69">that it actually works better</text>
  <text start="425.66" dur="3.75">sublingually so i&amp;#39;m gonna put it under</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="4.429">my tongue and just drink it a little bit</text>
  <text start="429.41" dur="2.509">of water a minute</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="9.45">this one is add ravine all our yeah okay</text>
  <text start="441.03" dur="7.919">so this is actually a I think it was</text>
  <text start="445.41" dur="5.069">originally designed for people who had</text>
  <text start="448.949" dur="4.44">like them certain kinds of conditions</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="6.66">mentally but it they had a lot of</text>
  <text start="453.389" dur="5.641">off-label stuff for it the interesting</text>
  <text start="457.139" dur="4.111">thing is that there&amp;#39;s another form</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="4.979">called medicinal that&amp;#39;s prescription</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="4.05">only that&amp;#39;s not legal in the US maybe</text>
  <text start="464.009" dur="3.571">you could technically buy it from India</text>
  <text start="465.3" dur="4.17">but I don&amp;#39;t want to risk anything this</text>
  <text start="467.58" dur="3.36">one&amp;#39;s like this one will turn into</text>
  <text start="469.47" dur="3.39">modafinil in your in your system it just</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="5.78">takes more work through your your</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="7.02">kidneys and stuff because it has to turn</text>
  <text start="476.72" dur="5.65">but it&amp;#39;s legal so I do a little bit of</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="6.83">this as well this is kind of a very</text>
  <text start="482.37" dur="4.34">popular nutraceutical</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="5.43">the brain drugs and since I will be</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="4.77">asking more of my brain I&amp;#39;m also gonna</text>
  <text start="494.92" dur="3.72">supplement with some choline it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="4.02">something yes you normally necessarily</text>
  <text start="498.64" dur="4.5">need but your brain uses a lot of this</text>
  <text start="501.04" dur="3.99">so I&amp;#39;m gonna put some of that in there</text>
  <text start="503.14" dur="2.19">as well this has got a strong flavor to</text>
  <text start="505.03" dur="9.12">it</text>
  <text start="505.33" dur="11.13">I do the nootropics like before an</text>
  <text start="514.15" dur="4.11">interview or before like a deep dive of</text>
  <text start="516.46" dur="4.25">study because it helps me to remember</text>
  <text start="518.26" dur="5.43">things again that is that is a</text>
  <text start="520.71" dur="6.49">experimental you know off-label kind of</text>
  <text start="523.69" dur="7.67">stuff it&amp;#39;s legal some of the nootropics</text>
  <text start="527.2" dur="6.48">have been made illegal but you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.36" dur="3.73">it&amp;#39;s definitely not the kind of thing</text>
  <text start="533.68" dur="2.91">that you would normally include in like</text>
  <text start="535.09" dur="3.84">your vitamins and stuff so I&amp;#39;m just want</text>
