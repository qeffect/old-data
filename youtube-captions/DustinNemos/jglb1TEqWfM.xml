  <text start="43.23" dur="3.78">comments I believe that this is going to</text>
  <text start="45.149" dur="6.151">be a two stage crash we&amp;#39;re gonna cover</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="5.729">real estate first but the crash first</text>
  <text start="51.3" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;re going to see real estates and</text>
  <text start="52.739" dur="7.351">stocks go down and investors have been</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="5.97">taught to run two bonds as the safe</text>
  <text start="60.09" dur="6.06">haven investment so US Treasuries should</text>
  <text start="63" dur="4.89">get one last pop because of this but</text>
  <text start="66.15" dur="6.27">then you&amp;#39;re going to see in the third</text>
  <text start="67.89" dur="8.549">segment the death of the global dollar</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="6.6">standard and in when that happens and it</text>
  <text start="76.439" dur="5.701">should be happening this crisis here the</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="5.459">crash should precipitate the death of</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="4.409">the global dollar standard the world has</text>
  <text start="84.479" dur="4.35">different monetary systems periodically</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s nothing new you&amp;#39;ll see all of this</text>
  <text start="88.829" dur="6.75">later but when that happens we will have</text>
  <text start="91.799" dur="7.5">a bond and currency crisis and at that</text>
  <text start="95.579" dur="6.33">point it will be the second half of this</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="4.411">event so we&amp;#39;re gonna get to the real</text>
  <text start="101.909" dur="4.771">estate data now this is dr. Robert</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="5.4">Schiller&amp;#39;s home price index and ever</text>
  <text start="106.68" dur="3.96">since that presentation in 2005 I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="4.23">been going to his website at Yale</text>
  <text start="110.64" dur="4.619">University periodically downloading the</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="3.599">information creating a spreadsheet and</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="6.93">presenting it creating a chart from the</text>
  <text start="116.939" dur="7.651">spreadsheet and I went there four months</text>
  <text start="122.189" dur="4.5">ago or so and just before we started</text>
  <text start="124.59" dur="4.559">putting together this presentation they</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="4.471">take a long time to do I&amp;#39;ve had a team</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="2.961">of people working on this for a few</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="3.5">months</text>
  <text start="132.11" dur="6.12">I went to his I wanted to give you the</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="6.69">very latest information and I went back</text>
  <text start="138.23" dur="5.25">to his website just before we got done</text>
  <text start="141.35" dur="4.11">with this presentation to get the</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="5.64">information and I clicked on his</text>
  <text start="145.46" dur="6.9">historic home press index and it went to</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="5.16">page not found and so I went back to the</text>
  <text start="152.36" dur="3.75">spreadsheet that I had downloaded four</text>
  <text start="154.28" dur="4.59">months earlier and looked at the data</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="6.03">and he hadn&amp;#39;t been updating the data for</text>
  <text start="158.87" dur="6.75">I don&amp;#39;t know nine months or a year it</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="6.03">was a long time so I hunted around for</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="4.92">the data it&amp;#39;s now the standard and poors</text>
  <text start="168.17" dur="6.21">case-shiller national home price index</text>
  <text start="170.54" dur="6.419">and so the information goes to S&amp;amp;P not</text>
  <text start="174.38" dur="5.4">to his own website but the Federal</text>
  <text start="176.959" dur="4.981">Reserve has the information so this is</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="4.35">the information as it was four months</text>
  <text start="181.94" dur="4.29">ago when I downloaded it and it was</text>
  <text start="184.13" dur="5.52">saying that we were back up into a</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="6.02">pretty massive bubble up here at 170 in</text>
  <text start="189.65" dur="6.48">other words 70% overvalued to the</text>
  <text start="192.25" dur="7.39">average and that there was only a couple</text>
  <text start="196.13" dur="6.63">of years in 2006 and seven where it had</text>
  <text start="199.64" dur="4.8">been more overvalued but then I went to</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="3.78">the feds website and got the latest</text>
  <text start="204.44" dur="4.68">information the case-shiller national</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="5.58">home price index and what it was telling</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="6.869">me is that we&amp;#39;re now we just exceeded</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="6.06">the height of the bubble in 2007 so the</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="4.711">bubble is even bigger than at the peak</text>
  <text start="218.18" dur="5.369">of the real-estate bubble in 2007 I</text>
  <text start="220.7" dur="7.11">added that data to his old data and</text>
  <text start="223.549" dur="7.141">we&amp;#39;re up at 201 the biggest bubble in</text>
  <text start="227.81" dur="5.55">history at this point so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.69" dur="4.769">definitely back into an enormous real</text>
  <text start="233.36" dur="3.81">estate bubble this is caused by the</text>
  <text start="235.459" dur="3.991">Federal Reserve taking interest rates</text>
  <text start="237.17" dur="4.65">down to zero making mortgages real</text>
  <text start="239.45" dur="4.8">affordable it&amp;#39;s caused by the economic</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="5.43">boom that Wall Street has had every</text>
  <text start="244.25" dur="6">major city has had a boom in real estate</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="5.67">one thing I need to point out is that we</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="6.269">are currently higher than the peak of</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="6.689">the 1929 stock market before it crashed</text>
  <text start="256.519" dur="6.121">and brought us the Great Depression the</text>
  <text start="259.609" dur="5.511">p/e ratio is the price of a share of</text>
  <text start="262.64" dur="6.17">stock divided by the earnings</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="5.91">sher so it&amp;#39;s the earnings that the</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="4.2">company makes in a year divided by the</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="5.37">number of shares that are out there and</text>
  <text start="273.01" dur="5.189">you should be paying a certain multiple</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="3.45">of earnings when you&amp;#39;re buying a stock</text>
  <text start="278.199" dur="3.811">but you don&amp;#39;t want to be paying a crazy</text>
  <text start="279.85" dur="3.21">multiple this is one of the best</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="3.57">valuations</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="3.63">that investors have been able to use to</text>
  <text start="285.58" dur="3.18">judge whether they&amp;#39;re buying an</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="5.58">overvalued or an undervalued stock and</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="5.79">so fair value lies somewhere between a</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="5.1">multiple of ten to fifteen times</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="5.28">earnings so that when the price is ten</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="5.49">to fifteen times earnings anything under</text>
  <text start="299.83" dur="4.92">ten is considered undervalued down when</text>
  <text start="302.86" dur="3.66">you get down to five that&amp;#39;s severely</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="4.32">undervalued a total bargain and you</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="5.49">should be buying that stock and you know</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="4.67">just sell everything and buy sell</text>
  <text start="312.01" dur="3.96">everything else and buy stocks</text>
  <text start="313.74" dur="5.41">overvalued is fifteen to twenty and</text>
  <text start="315.97" dur="6.12">after twenty you&amp;#39;re in a bubble and when</text>
  <text start="319.15" dur="4.71">you get up past twenty seven to thirty</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="6">you&amp;#39;re in a hyper bubble at that point</text>
  <text start="323.86" dur="6.15">so here&amp;#39;s the information and this goes</text>
  <text start="328.09" dur="4.94">all the way back to the year 1880</text>
  <text start="330.01" dur="6.719">now the S&amp;amp;P actually only goes back to</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="5.46">1950 but dr. Robert Shiller took the 500</text>
  <text start="336.729" dur="4.921">largest companies in America and</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="5.049">calculated the stock prices the earnings</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="5.88">the dividend yields and all of this</text>
  <text start="343.539" dur="6.091">stuff going back to 1880 and what this</text>
  <text start="347.53" dur="4.199">shows is that we went into a bubble in</text>
  <text start="349.63" dur="4.11">the you know every time it exceeds this</text>
  <text start="351.729" dur="5.671">orange area and gets up into the red</text>
  <text start="353.74" dur="6.33">that&amp;#39;s a bubble and we went into a</text>
  <text start="357.4" dur="5.48">bubble in 1901 and once the trend</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="5.25">reverses it doesn&amp;#39;t stop the bubble was</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="5.08">25.2 so the price that people were</text>
  <text start="365.32" dur="6.24">paying for a stock was 25 times the</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="5.01">earnings and remember fair value is 10</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="3.96">to 15</text>
  <text start="372.97" dur="6.75">once the trend reverses in that bubble</text>
  <text start="375.52" dur="6.48">pops it doesn&amp;#39;t stop until that stock</text>
  <text start="379.72" dur="4.199">reaches severe undervaluation</text>
  <text start="382" dur="5.34">and it bounces like a ball on the way</text>
  <text start="383.919" dur="8.851">down it takes the stairs down a bubble</text>
  <text start="387.34" dur="7.199">of 32.6 in 1929 and with the stock</text>
  <text start="392.77" dur="4.139">market crash it went down to severely</text>
  <text start="394.539" dur="4.411">undervalued bubble undervalued bubble</text>
  <text start="396.909" dur="4.441">undervalued so without except</text>
  <text start="398.95" dur="4.68">every time it got up into the red before</text>
  <text start="401.35" dur="4.86">a new bull market would start that was a</text>
  <text start="403.63" dur="5.46">healthy real bull market it had to visit</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="5.13">undervaluation people had to give up on</text>
  <text start="409.09" dur="3.57">stocks stocks had to be basically the</text>
  <text start="411.34" dur="3.66">worst investment that you could ever</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="4.5">make that&amp;#39;s when a brand new healthy</text>
  <text start="415" dur="5.16">bull market starts is when everybody</text>
  <text start="417.16" dur="4.92">thinks that stocks are just you know a</text>
  <text start="420.16" dur="4.02">death wish if you&amp;#39;re going to invest in</text>
  <text start="422.08" dur="4.26">them well then we went into the biggest</text>
  <text start="424.18" dur="5.01">bubble in history in the year 2000 with</text>
  <text start="426.34" dur="5.16">the dot-com tech bubble of forty four</text>
  <text start="429.19" dur="5.43">point two this was astronomical</text>
  <text start="431.5" dur="5.85">that means it&amp;#39;s 40 you&amp;#39;re paying forty</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="5.28">four times the earnings and even if they</text>
  <text start="437.35" dur="5.22">were to give you all of the earnings as</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="4.86">dividends you would have to wait forty</text>
  <text start="442.57" dur="5.12">four years to get your investment back</text>
  <text start="444.76" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s crazy that&amp;#39;s like your lifetime</text>
  <text start="447.69" dur="6.37">then when that bubble popped it went</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="6.56">down to the border of overvalued to</text>
  <text start="454.06" dur="5.85">bubble and it bounced with all of the</text>
  <text start="457.23" dur="6.64">you know alan greenspan took interest</text>
  <text start="459.91" dur="7.29">rates from over 5% of canada there were</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="5.55">six something back then down to one and</text>
  <text start="467.2" dur="3.87">he held them there too long to get the</text>
  <text start="469.42" dur="4.29">stock markets back up and he was</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="5.61">successful he got them back up to twenty</text>
  <text start="473.71" dur="6.15">seven point six in the years 2006 and</text>
  <text start="476.68" dur="4.89">seven but he accidentally created a real</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="4.17">estate bubble the real estate bubble</text>
  <text start="481.57" dur="4.41">sort of came squirting out of here just</text>
  <text start="484.03" dur="4.47">out of his peripheral vision he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="485.98" dur="4.94">even know that he was creating one of</text>
  <text start="488.5" dur="6.78">the biggest bubbles in global history</text>
  <text start="490.92" dur="7.03">and then when the global financial</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="5.37">crisis hit and that bubble popped stocks</text>
  <text start="497.95" dur="5.16">only visited fair value and then we</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="4.41">created we went from zero point eight</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="4.62">trillion dollars worth of base currency</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s how much of the paper dollars and</text>
  <text start="507.73" dur="5.28">the the currency that the Federal</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="7.02">Reserve creates there was zero point</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="6.51">eight and they created another three</text>
  <text start="516.76" dur="5.43">point four trillion and we ended up with</text>
  <text start="519.52" dur="4.92">four point two trillion was the peak put</text>
  <text start="522.19" dur="4.62">it on that we put that three point two</text>
  <text start="524.44" dur="5.61">three point four on top of the zero</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="5.16">point eight so the currency supply was</text>
  <text start="530.05" dur="5.789">five times larger than it</text>
  <text start="531.97" dur="6.179">been in 2008 during the end that I</text>
  <text start="535.839" dur="4.74">believe is the reason that this bounced</text>
  <text start="538.149" dur="6.18">this should be one of the bounces on the</text>
  <text start="540.579" dur="5.94">way down to severe undervaluation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.329" dur="4.11">what&amp;#39;s caused this to be exaggerated and</text>
  <text start="546.519" dur="6.36">I&amp;#39;ll show you out I&amp;#39;ll prove that to you</text>
  <text start="548.439" dur="7.861">in a moment but I&amp;#39;m so right now or</text>
  <text start="552.879" dur="5.76">earlier this year we hit a peak of 33.3</text>
  <text start="556.3" dur="6.329">which again is insane valuation these</text>
  <text start="558.639" dur="6.45">are hyper bubbles and I maintain that</text>
  <text start="562.629" dur="4.32">this is actually just another one of the</text>
  <text start="565.089" dur="4.62">bounces on the way down to severe</text>
  <text start="566.949" dur="5.88">undervaluation before a real bull market</text>
  <text start="569.709" dur="5.61">can start again so one thing I need to</text>
  <text start="572.829" dur="6.541">point out is that we are currently</text>
  <text start="575.319" dur="6.781">higher than the peak of the 1929 stock</text>
  <text start="579.37" dur="5.37">market before it crashed and brought us</text>
  <text start="582.1" dur="4.589">the Great Depression another way of</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="4.139">measuring stocks and these are two of</text>
  <text start="586.689" dur="3.991">the most fundamental of ways that</text>
  <text start="588.879" dur="5.64">investors have measured stocks for a</text>
  <text start="590.68" dur="5.82">century is dividend yields if you own a</text>
  <text start="594.519" dur="4.44">stock and you pay a certain the</text>
  <text start="596.5" dur="4.37">Congressional Budget Office I&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="598.959" dur="4.44">think of some sort of acronym that</text>
  <text start="600.87" dur="6.279">instead of Congressional Budget Office</text>
  <text start="603.399" dur="8.401">it&amp;#39;s the Congressional bozos of</text>
  <text start="607.149" dur="6.3">something they&amp;#39;ve just decided that the</text>

  <text start="616.329" dur="4.86">not going to have a recession for more</text>
  <text start="618.16" dur="5.52">than ten more years this is pretty much</text>
  <text start="621.189" dur="4.561">an impossibility if you&amp;#39;ve been through</text>
  <text start="623.68" dur="3.509">a recession before you know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.75" dur="3.99">another recession right around the</text>

  <text start="675.8" dur="4.44">miles an hour and what will happen is</text>
  <text start="678.68" dur="3.329">people become bored I mean you&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="680.24" dur="3.57">drive hours and hours and hours to go</text>
  <text start="682.009" dur="4.741">from LA to San Francisco or LA to</text>
  <text start="683.81" dur="5.94">Sacramento and the valley almost goes to</text>
  <text start="686.75" dur="5.49">from LA to Oregon almost and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="689.75" dur="5.97">in these fogs before driving 15 miles an</text>
  <text start="692.24" dur="6.209">hour and then a car passes me at 80 just</text>
  <text start="695.72" dur="4.53">driving I mean way over anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="698.449" dur="4.411">safe there&amp;#39;s no possibility if there was</text>
  <text start="700.25" dur="4.529">something there that he could stop he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="702.86" dur="4.56">just hoping that the other car in front</text>
  <text start="704.779" dur="4.86">of him is also going hey that&amp;#39;s but</text>
  <text start="707.42" dur="4.14">anyway one car will plow into another</text>
  <text start="709.639" dur="4.111">and there&amp;#39;s an accident and then another</text>
  <text start="711.56" dur="4.649">car hits it in another car and some of</text>
  <text start="713.75" dur="5.04">these pileups are more than 100 cars and</text>
  <text start="716.209" dur="4.921">then a big tractor-trailer rig comes out</text>
  <text start="718.79" dur="3.779">of the fog and piles into everybody just</text>
  <text start="721.13" dur="3.93">when everybody thinks it&amp;#39;s over with</text>
  <text start="722.569" dur="4.411">this is the two stage crash the</text>
  <text start="725.06" dur="4.62">tractor-trailer rig is the bonds that I</text>
  <text start="726.98" dur="5.669">was talking about the the currency</text>
  <text start="729.68" dur="5.399">crisis bond crisis and part of the cause</text>
  <text start="732.649" dur="6.031">is the financialization of government</text>
  <text start="735.079" dur="5.731">and this again is stock market</text>
  <text start="738.68" dur="3.93">capitalization but I&amp;#39;ve put it on a</text>
  <text start="740.81" dur="4.11">different scale here this isn&amp;#39;t on the</text>
  <text start="742.61" dur="4.86">stock market capitalization scale this</text>
  <text start="744.92" dur="6.24">is on the scale that matches the base</text>
  <text start="747.47" dur="5.76">currency the amount of dollars that the</text>
  <text start="751.16" dur="4.289">Federal Reserve creates and the reason I</text>
  <text start="753.23" dur="4.89">put it on here is I wanted to show you</text>
  <text start="755.449" dur="5.58">the correlation the match of base</text>
  <text start="758.12" dur="5.699">currency creation and the stock market</text>
  <text start="761.029" dur="7.201">capitalization there is six years ago</text>
  <text start="763.819" dur="9.361">six years of information here from 2009</text>
  <text start="768.23" dur="7.229">to the end of 2014 that the stock market</text>
  <text start="773.18" dur="5.88">and the creation of currency almost</text>
  <text start="775.459" dur="6.23">matched each other exactly and so to me</text>
  <text start="779.06" dur="5.1">I don&amp;#39;t think that there&amp;#39;s any chance</text>
  <text start="781.689" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no chance in hell that</text>
  <text start="784.16" dur="4.429">this is</text>
  <text start="785.529" dur="6.72">an accident this this can&amp;#39;t be a</text>
  <text start="788.589" dur="6.54">coincidence the creation of currency is</text>
  <text start="792.249" dur="6.51">what lifted the stock market now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="795.129" dur="5.671">going to show you tax revenues to the US</text>
  <text start="798.759" dur="4.591">so this is federal tax revenues and</text>
  <text start="800.8" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;ve become reliant on the stock</text>
  <text start="803.35" dur="4.289">market doing well back before the year</text>
  <text start="805.36" dur="4.56">2000 there wasn&amp;#39;t any correlation</text>
  <text start="807.639" dur="4.5">between the stock market and the UWE and</text>
  <text start="809.92" dur="4.62">the federal tax revenues but after the</text>
  <text start="812.139" dur="5.041">year 2000 there&amp;#39;s a very high</text>
  <text start="814.54" dur="6.51">correlation and one thing I want to</text>
  <text start="817.18" dur="6.24">point out here is that qe1 and qe2 did</text>
  <text start="821.05" dur="5.13">trickle from wall street down to Main</text>
  <text start="823.42" dur="5.19">Street the QE 3 was nothing but a gift</text>
  <text start="826.18" dur="4.86">to the richest people on the planet they</text>
  <text start="828.61" dur="4.709">created all that currency and all of it</text>
  <text start="831.04" dur="4.14">went into the big you know it pumped up</text>
  <text start="833.319" dur="6.661">the big brokerage houses and the</text>
  <text start="835.18" dur="8.19">financial firms now I put GDP in here</text>
  <text start="839.98" dur="5.07">this is getting to be a complex heart to</text>
  <text start="843.37" dur="3.24">read because there&amp;#39;s too many lines on</text>
  <text start="845.05" dur="3.93">it all take one of them out in a minute</text>
  <text start="846.61" dur="3.99">but I just put this on here because I</text>
  <text start="848.98" dur="3.599">wanted to show you this wrinkle here</text>
  <text start="850.6" dur="4.589">this is the first significant</text>
  <text start="852.579" dur="5.221">contraction in GDP since the Great</text>
  <text start="855.189" dur="5.88">Depression so the only stock market</text>
  <text start="857.8" dur="6.269">crash that you can point to looking back</text>
  <text start="861.069" dur="7.26">that caused a significant wrinkle in GDP</text>
  <text start="864.069" dur="6.481">was the stock market crash of 1929 now</text>
  <text start="868.329" dur="4.471">this is interest rates and I put that on</text>
  <text start="870.55" dur="4.139">here because there&amp;#39;s this huge gap in</text>
  <text start="872.8" dur="3.779">here where there&amp;#39;s nothing and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.689" dur="3.51">where there should be at free market</text>
  <text start="876.579" dur="4.32">interest rates and that&amp;#39;s where there</text>
  <text start="878.199" dur="4.711">should be the currency supply this gap</text>
  <text start="880.899" dur="3.901">pushing the currency supply up here</text>
  <text start="882.91" dur="4.739">taking interest rates down to zero that</text>
  <text start="884.8" dur="4.44">made all of the homes more affordable</text>
  <text start="887.649" dur="4.23">and pushed real estate back into a</text>
  <text start="889.24" dur="4.319">bubble all the currency creation and the</text>
  <text start="891.879" dur="3.45">low head low interest rates encourages</text>
  <text start="893.559" dur="2.911">margin debt so that&amp;#39;s the reason we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="895.329" dur="3.75">seen margin debt go to these</text>
  <text start="896.47" dur="6.39">astronomical levels and the currency</text>
  <text start="899.079" dur="6.24">creation lifted the stock market so I</text>
  <text start="902.86" dur="6.06">want to now point out this little tiny</text>
  <text start="905.319" dur="5.25">wrinkle back in 1987 here because this</text>
  <text start="908.92" dur="4.279">is what&amp;#39;s called a linear chart it goes</text>
  <text start="910.569" dur="7.681">one two three four five six a</text>
  <text start="913.199" dur="5.931">logarithmic chart instead of the numbers</text>
  <text start="918.25" dur="3.88">going up</text>
  <text start="919.13" dur="5.22">here it&amp;#39;s this the percent change stays</text>
  <text start="922.13" dur="5.01">linear so if it rises ten percent the</text>
  <text start="924.35" dur="4.98">next step is ten percent of whatever the</text>
  <text start="927.14" dur="6.87">total was so in other words it would go</text>
  <text start="929.33" dur="6.87">one two four eight sixteen thirty-two so</text>
  <text start="934.01" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m gonna take this same information in</text>
  <text start="936.2" dur="5.46">a while I&amp;#39;ll show it to you that way but</text>
  <text start="938.45" dur="5.67">I&amp;#39;m gonna zoom in first on that stock</text>
  <text start="941.66" dur="5.25">market crash and that little wrinkle was</text>
  <text start="944.12" dur="4.71">actually pretty darn big we&amp;#39;ll put a</text>
  <text start="946.91" dur="4.08">link underneath this video so that you</text>
  <text start="948.83" dur="6.12">can listen a friend of mine grant</text>
  <text start="950.99" dur="7.29">Williams did a phenomenal presentation</text>
  <text start="954.95" dur="5.19">on the 1987 stock market crash people</text>
  <text start="958.28" dur="3.9">thought the world was coming to an end</text>
  <text start="960.14" dur="3.81">there was a single day here where the</text>
  <text start="962.18" dur="4.8">stock markets in the United States lost</text>
  <text start="963.95" dur="6.39">26 percent of their value peak to trough</text>
  <text start="966.98" dur="5.16">is 33 percent yet the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="970.34" dur="5.04">didn&amp;#39;t have to rush in with any currency</text>
  <text start="972.14" dur="7.71">creation the GDP did not change</text>
  <text start="975.38" dur="7.41">whatsoever and the tax revenues they</text>
  <text start="979.85" dur="5.58">contracted but so little it&amp;#39;s not worth</text>
  <text start="982.79" dur="4.14">mentioning 1.4 percent is basically like</text>
  <text start="985.43" dur="1.74">a rounding error when you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="986.93" dur="3">about</text>
  <text start="987.17" dur="4.77">federal tax revenues and the time it</text>
  <text start="989.93" dur="5.07">took to get to brand-new highs in tax</text>
  <text start="991.94" dur="6.36">revenues was just nine months because</text>
  <text start="995" dur="4.97">they do the reporting quarterly so it</text>
  <text start="998.3" dur="4.71">was actually less than nine months</text>
  <text start="999.97" dur="5.35">contrast that with the crashes that</text>
  <text start="1003.01" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;ve had this century and the tax</text>
  <text start="1005.32" dur="5.52">revenues after the dot-com bubble popped</text>
  <text start="1007.39" dur="6.18">the tax revenues fell by almost 20% and</text>
  <text start="1010.84" dur="5.46">then in the global financial crisis oh</text>
  <text start="1013.57" dur="5.61">and it took four years and three months</text>
  <text start="1016.3" dur="5.73">four and a quarter years to get back to</text>
  <text start="1019.18" dur="5.97">break-even versus nine months for the 87</text>
  <text start="1022.03" dur="6.45">stock market crash yeah this is very</text>
  <text start="1025.15" dur="5.299">significant then the crisis of the</text>
  <text start="1028.48" dur="4.44">global financial crisis you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1030.449" dur="5.591">28% so we&amp;#39;re talking about almost a</text>
  <text start="1032.92" dur="5.73">third contraction here of you know more</text>
  <text start="1036.04" dur="6.48">than a quarter less than a third of tax</text>
  <text start="1038.65" dur="6.75">revenues and five and a quarter years to</text>
  <text start="1042.52" dur="5.85">get back to break-even now the problem</text>
  <text start="1045.4" dur="4.95">here is politicians in good times always</text>
  <text start="1048.37" dur="3.42">project them infinitely out into the</text>
  <text start="1050.35" dur="2.64">future I&amp;#39;m going to show you this in a</text>
  <text start="1051.79" dur="3.81">moment</text>
  <text start="1052.99" dur="4.62">and they base all of their spending on</text>
  <text start="1055.6" dur="4.199">that and when they do it when they pass</text>
  <text start="1057.61" dur="4.409">a budget it&amp;#39;s always passed with a</text>
  <text start="1059.799" dur="4.411">deficit built into it they always plan</text>
  <text start="1062.019" dur="4.14">on spending more than their income this</text>
  <text start="1064.21" dur="5.37">is just something they do year after</text>
  <text start="1066.159" dur="4.951">year after year counting on inflation to</text>
  <text start="1069.58" dur="3.66">sort of make up the difference and there</text>
  <text start="1071.11" dur="4.23">will be enough tax revenues next year or</text>
  <text start="1073.24" dur="3.96">the net of the year after but when you</text>
  <text start="1075.34" dur="3.99">have something like this this was what</text>
  <text start="1077.2" dur="4.829">was responsible for the trillion</text>
  <text start="1079.33" dur="5.939">dollar-plus budget deficits that we saw</text>
  <text start="1082.029" dur="6.36">after the global financial crisis so</text>
  <text start="1085.269" dur="5.37">this next chart is the duration of</text>
  <text start="1088.389" dur="4.711">economic expansions which simply means</text>
  <text start="1090.639" dur="4.29">the length of time between recessions</text>
  <text start="1093.1" dur="4.669">you have a recession which is a</text>
  <text start="1094.929" dur="6.6">contraction then you&amp;#39;ve got an expansion</text>
  <text start="1097.769" dur="6.52">so this is the data there are 33 of them</text>
  <text start="1101.529" dur="5.61">in here these are the the 33 previous</text>
  <text start="1104.289" dur="5.25">economic expansions that we&amp;#39;ve had in US</text>
  <text start="1107.139" dur="5.01">history going all the way back to 1854</text>
  <text start="1109.539" dur="7.441">so three of these happened before</text>
  <text start="1112.149" dur="7.561">Lincoln was assassinated the the average</text>
  <text start="1116.98" dur="4.949">here is four and a half years so usually</text>
  <text start="1119.71" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s a recession every foreign the</text>
  <text start="1121.929" dur="4.771">expansion goes four and a half years</text>
  <text start="1123.94" dur="4.26">there&amp;#39;s a recession then you come out of</text>
  <text start="1126.7" dur="3.38">the recession that expansion goes four</text>
  <text start="1128.2" dur="4.709">and a half years there&amp;#39;s a recession</text>
  <text start="1130.08" dur="5.349">we&amp;#39;re currently in the second longest</text>
  <text start="1132.909" dur="5.49">economic expansion in history so this is</text>
  <text start="1135.429" dur="5.58">already very very old and should be</text>
  <text start="1138.399" dur="5.071">coming to an end soon but the</text>
  <text start="1141.009" dur="4.37">Congressional Budget Office I&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="1143.47" dur="4.409">think of some sort of acronym that</text>
  <text start="1145.379" dur="6.25">instead of Congressional Budget Office</text>
  <text start="1147.879" dur="8.43">it&amp;#39;s the Congressional bozos of</text>

  <text start="1160.84" dur="4.74">not going to have a recession for more</text>
  <text start="1162.669" dur="5.521">than ten more years this is pretty much</text>
