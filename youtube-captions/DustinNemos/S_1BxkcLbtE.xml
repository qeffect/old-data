  <text start="25.41" dur="3.75">work that I do so that the politics may</text>
  <text start="27.39" dur="3.959">not taint the health aspect of what I do</text>
  <text start="29.16" dur="4.68">and to that end I&amp;#39;m gonna launch the</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="4.71">whole new website and I&amp;#39;m going to start</text>

  <text start="64.83" dur="6.21">I will have larger batches I will have</text>
  <text start="68.729" dur="4.051">larger quantities going in and then we</text>
  <text start="71.04" dur="3.48">will we&amp;#39;ll get this thing streamlined</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="4.589">you know it is a bootstrap business from</text>
  <text start="74.52" dur="6.54">the very ground up now I also have about</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="5.341">9 left of the little 2 ounce bottles now</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="3">I usually use these for coconut oil I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="82.71" dur="3.39">putting olive oil because that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="3.9">got right now and I&amp;#39;m not labeling them</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="4.76">because I don&amp;#39;t have a 2 ounce label for</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="5.159">for this these are just for the sample</text>
  <text start="90.86" dur="6.759">sample bottles which are basically at</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="7.411">cost for people who have ailing pets who</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="4.86">want to experiment at home not medical</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="3.119">advice no claims or anything like that</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="3.331">but if you&amp;#39;ve seen what I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="3.631">talking about lately and if you&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="3.36">any other research into what this can do</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="4.379">for animals if you&amp;#39;ve read any of the</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="4.409">testimonials then people are interested</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="4.981">sometimes that&amp;#39;s they have no other hope</text>
  <text start="113.579" dur="6.39">so you know there there&amp;#39;s an opportunity</text>
  <text start="116.64" dur="5.4">there all I ask for these sample bottles</text>
  <text start="119.969" dur="4.29">you know this is not just a freebie this</text>
  <text start="122.04" dur="5.219">is I need I need something back from you</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="4.771">and what I would need from you is a you</text>
  <text start="127.259" dur="2.821">know a short video of your pet it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="136.26" dur="3.48">with the pet and and what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="4.17">with the health complications and where</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="5.18">they are these be as you know as</text>
  <text start="142.2" dur="5.22">scientific about it as you can and then</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="5.08">one month later after you get this</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="5.31">bottle I want like a second follow-up</text>
  <text start="150" dur="4.26">video where you tell me kind of if</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s been an impact at all if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="3.72">gotten better you know what what your</text>
  <text start="156.45" dur="3.87">personal experience is this is not</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="4.23">science this is anecdotal this is</text>
  <text start="160.32" dur="4.86">subjective this is testimonials this is</text>
  <text start="162.21" dur="4.74">not science but the system has failed us</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="4.5">and this is the best that we can do for</text>
  <text start="166.95" dur="4.38">now if anyone is interested in helping</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="3.77">me fund it I would like to actually do</text>
  <text start="171.33" dur="4.86">some actual controlled studies with rats</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="4.99">maybe even on my bookshelf behind me so</text>
  <text start="176.19" dur="4.38">that you can see the little guys and I</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t mean just regular rats I mean like</text>
  <text start="180.57" dur="2.85">the expensive like hundred dollar rats</text>
  <text start="182.07" dur="3.36">from the labs that are basically like</text>
  <text start="183.42" dur="3.33">genetically identical because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="3.81">what you need if you&amp;#39;re gonna do an</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="4.05">actual like scientific study so I would</text>
  <text start="189.24" dur="4.83">like to do like a batch of controlled</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="5.1">rats multi-generational you know some</text>
  <text start="194.07" dur="3.57">parent rats and their offspring and just</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="4.05">see how it goes from birth to death you</text>
  <text start="197.64" dur="4.98">know all the way some of these rats have</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="4.59">been created in such a way or through I</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="3.9">guess you know not not necessarily</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="3.65">genetic engineering but through</text>
  <text start="206.52" dur="3.81">selective breeding and stuff I hope</text>
  <text start="208.19" dur="4.51">where they only live for about a year</text>
  <text start="210.33" dur="4.86">and I would like to show you guys in</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="4.7">real time behind me as you guys watch my</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="5.91">videos so just a reason to stick around</text>
  <text start="217.4" dur="6.61">what happens to a cage full of these</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="5.16">rats after a year and what happens to a</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="4.59">cage full of rats that take just regular</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="4.17">oil without the c60 in it as a control</text>
  <text start="228.6" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;m not a scientist this is home</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="4.68">research but like I said the system has</text>
  <text start="232.26" dur="5.07">failed us right the the system of</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="4.08">Medicine is killing us the people that</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="5.22">are supposed to be healing us are</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="5.28">poisoning us in every system on every</text>
  <text start="242.55" dur="4.65">level we are being failed by this system</text>
  <text start="244.47" dur="4.47">we have to in my opinion take back our</text>
  <text start="247.2" dur="3.84">health and that&amp;#39;s a big part of what my</text>
  <text start="248.94" dur="3.59">channel is about so if anyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="3.99">interested in this you know if you are</text>
  <text start="252.53" dur="4.329">if you see the benefit of showing people</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="4.07">who are our doubters that you know a</text>
  <text start="256.859" dur="5.401">controlled opposition are controlled a</text>
  <text start="259.1" dur="6.25">controlled trial in the background of my</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="4.439">video please let me know and to that</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="2.67">extent</text>
  <text start="266.699" dur="3.481">you know wouldn&amp;#39;t be a very expensive</text>
  <text start="268.02" dur="3.78">budget project but you know a couple</text>
  <text start="270.18" dur="3.269">hundred dollars for these rats to get</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="3.78">started I would probably like to get</text>
  <text start="273.449" dur="4.71">more than two you know I&amp;#39;d like to get</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="5.13">the ones a breeding pair so that I could</text>
  <text start="278.159" dur="4.73">have the babies and testing the results</text>
  <text start="280.71" dur="4.38">over time and they wouldn&amp;#39;t be as lonely</text>
  <text start="282.889" dur="4.391">they would have their families and be</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="5.879">good life for them you know how I treat</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="5.43">my pets so this is just an idea stay</text>
  <text start="290.969" dur="2.97">tuned because when these videos come out</text>
