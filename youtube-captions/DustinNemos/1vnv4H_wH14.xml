  <text start="12.719" dur="4.801">that is anti key will dock Smee rather</text>
  <text start="14.88" dur="4.05">than address my arguments and so far</text>
  <text start="17.52" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s been two for two</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="4.439">after I challenged him to a debate and</text>
  <text start="20.67" dur="4.74">they didn&amp;#39;t show up so there&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="23.369" dur="4.621">bit of something to be said for hey I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="25.41" dur="4.26">over the target however I did get a</text>
  <text start="27.99" dur="4.229">couple of comments like Dustin I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="29.67" dur="4.11">believe this about you so or one so I</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="3.601">want to address this because you know I</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="3.45">I did this before and I address this I</text>
  <text start="35.82" dur="3.36">think in a live chat and I addressed</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="3.3">this in a Twitter feed and but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="3.809">new people there&amp;#39;s new eyes let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="40.53" dur="4.38">address it again now either you believe</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="4.23">that the Department of Justice and the</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="4.23">Russian investigation is legitimate and</text>
  <text start="47.219" dur="4.651">that they&amp;#39;re infallible and the Justice</text>
  <text start="49.14" dur="4.2">Department is just or you believe that</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="3.24">there are flaws in the system and people</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="4.469">get screwed and that there are many</text>
  <text start="55.11" dur="5.64">people in prison who are victimless</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="6.271">crimes don&amp;#39;t need to be there now I have</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="5.88">been to prison I have been in prison and</text>
  <text start="64.08" dur="5.91">I have walked among murderers and</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="7.77">thieves and rapists and arsonists and</text>
  <text start="69.99" dur="9.12">gang people who have engaged in murders</text>
  <text start="74.4" dur="6.3">themselves and you know I&amp;#39;m not trying</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="3.75">to brag or gloat or anything I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="80.7" dur="3.959">some badass or whatever but you know</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="6.84">I&amp;#39;ve been in plenty of fights you know</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="7.591">now here&amp;#39;s the thing I didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="4.86">anything immoral and you know they can</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="4.89">accuse me of these things and they can</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="5.34">throw the book at me but I still have my</text>
  <text start="97.14" dur="5.339">integrity now let me explain because you</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="4.609">deserve context when people are making</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="7.92">these kind of accusations and as usual</text>
  <text start="104.509" dur="7.75">context is key so I was charged with</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="5.01">trafficking heroin that&amp;#39;s the big one</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="5.101">that&amp;#39;s the big example the context</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="4.951">however if for those who know me and</text>
  <text start="117.36" dur="5.759">have watched my show know that I hate</text>
  <text start="120.36" dur="4.17">like I loathe hard drugs like I&amp;#39;m okay</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="4.621">with people smoking marijuana I think</text>
  <text start="124.53" dur="5.599">that that&amp;#39;s a you know a kind of a net</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="4.469">positive for society and in many ways</text>
  <text start="130.129" dur="3.011">including health and including getting</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="3.271">people off of heroin</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="3.81">and they&amp;#39;re one of the biggest reasons</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="4.11">that I think that is because I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="5.85">my brother get off of heroin using</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="5.01">marijuana and you know my context here</text>
  <text start="142.8" dur="4.5">is I&amp;#39;ve watched my brother and my mother</text>
  <text start="144.6" dur="5.04">and my sister and my aunt I&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="4.08">with pills and then move up to snorting</text>
  <text start="149.64" dur="3.569">and in injecting pills and then move up</text>
  <text start="151.38" dur="4.079">to street heroin and now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="4.231">basically all walking dead like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="155.459" dur="6.03">still alive but there&amp;#39;s really nobody</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="5.25">home and they you know I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="161.489" dur="3">that they would still for me but they</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="5.94">would stole from anyone else you know</text>
  <text start="164.489" dur="5.881">just to meet their habit and for those</text>
  <text start="168.63" dur="3.81">who follow my channel I don&amp;#39;t even do</text>
  <text start="170.37" dur="4.53">aspirin alright I do all of my own DIY</text>
  <text start="172.44" dur="6.51">health supplements I&amp;#39;m holistic as I can</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="6.63">be I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m completely homeopathic and I</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t even do Advil or aspirin or any of</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="4.86">that stuff if I had like a nerve pain I</text>
  <text start="184.2" dur="5.06">do something called hyper cone perforate</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="8.36">them which is a holistic nerve pain pill</text>
  <text start="189.26" dur="8.53">so I don&amp;#39;t even I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="194.75" dur="5.62">like these things much less what I sell</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="4.77">them to people all right now some people</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="3.72">have taken this out of context and and</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s actually implied that I was</text>
  <text start="204.09" dur="3.72">selling drugs to kids and all this other</text>
  <text start="205.89" dur="5.159">stuff and that is completely not even</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="5.04">anything I was accused of but you know</text>
  <text start="211.049" dur="5.16">as for the accusation that I was a drug</text>
  <text start="212.85" dur="5.609">dealer that is its kind of ironic given</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="4.381">my hat like my own personal history with</text>
  <text start="218.459" dur="4.171">those drugs but the context is that my</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="3.179">sister who is addicted to drugs and</text>
  <text start="222.63" dur="4.699">became a prostitute</text>
  <text start="223.769" dur="6.241">I found her own back page of all places</text>
  <text start="227.329" dur="4.571">she left a bottle of vicodin at my home</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="3.33">and I don&amp;#39;t remember how many pills I</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="4.71">think it was like 50 something pills in</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="5.07">that bottle vicodin or I think if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="236.61" dur="4.86">recalling correctly like one of the</text>
  <text start="238.41" dur="5.1">weaker pain pills the only time I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="4.35">ever even used these kind of things were</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="5.55">was when I got ran over and I like</text>
  <text start="245.82" dur="6.15">needed anything I would didn&amp;#39;t care I</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="4.14">just was in pain and I didn&amp;#39;t even have</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="2.94">you know I didn&amp;#39;t even know about</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="3.33">marijuana packet then I just had got ran</text>
  <text start="254.91" dur="3.6">over and I was in bed for a long period</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="3.84">of time and I probably did some damage</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="3.27">to my liver honestly because it only</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="2.85">takes about a week of taking those</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="2.93">opioids and you starting to mess up your</text>
  <text start="263.22" dur="5.19">liver permanently</text>
  <text start="264.71" dur="6.16">but you know that&amp;#39;s just that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="268.41" dur="4.44">going off on a tangent there the the</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="4.65">fact is that she left these things in my</text>
  <text start="272.85" dur="4.44">home and and that wasn&amp;#39;t the end of it</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="3.93">it actually ended up being a little bit</text>
  <text start="277.29" dur="4.68">of a drama situation as well because in</text>
  <text start="279.45" dur="5.97">full context my best friend of about 10</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="5.67">years I&amp;#39;m not gonna say his name his</text>
  <text start="285.42" dur="5.49">sister owed me money on a car right I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="287.64" dur="4.62">into investing so I had loaned money his</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="2.82">sister was not the most reliable person</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="3.54">but it was a friend and I was trying to</text>
  <text start="293.73" dur="4.59">help out their family so I took the car</text>
  <text start="295.8" dur="4.68">as collateral all right she signed the</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="4.11">car as collateral to me now this is not</text>
  <text start="300.48" dur="3.54">a car anyone wants as collateral I mean</text>
  <text start="302.43" dur="2.91">it&amp;#39;s a piece of crap but it was only</text>
  <text start="304.02" dur="4.73">about it two or three thousand dollar</text>
  <text start="305.34" dur="5.94">loan and I did it to help out well</text>
  <text start="308.75" dur="5.32">months go by and not a single payment</text>
  <text start="311.28" dur="6.66">they start to avoid me so I go to</text>
  <text start="314.07" dur="5.31">repossess the car well this is about</text>
  <text start="317.94" dur="3.33">when my sister had left a bottle of</text>
  <text start="319.38" dur="6.03">pills at my house my friend was visiting</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="6.66">and he saw it I guess and then recorded</text>
  <text start="325.41" dur="6.09">me as being a drug dealer so not only</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="4.59">was this my sister kind of I mean I</text>
  <text start="331.5" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think she did it on</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="3.72">purpose I think she was just stupid but</text>
  <text start="334.5" dur="3.63">my friend betrayed me and that was</text>
  <text start="336.24" dur="3.48">really the great part of this that hurt</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="3.6">the most because you know I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="339.72" dur="3.27">about what the government says about me</text>
  <text start="341.73" dur="3">I mean they they&amp;#39;re trying to pretend</text>
  <text start="342.99" dur="3.69">that Trump is involved in Russian</text>
  <text start="344.73" dur="3.66">collusion now as well I mean nobody</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="3.42">trusts the government anyway</text>
  <text start="348.39" dur="4.11">the average person commits three</text>
  <text start="350.1" dur="6.69">felonies per day by the way so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.5" dur="6.09">all felons most likely but at the end of</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="3.3">the day I&amp;#39;m a self-employed kind of guy</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="2.97">I don&amp;#39;t really want to work for other</text>
  <text start="360.09" dur="3.15">people anyway so this stuff doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="3.33">really affect me knowing people that</text>
  <text start="363.24" dur="4.83">meet me and talk to me they know I have</text>
  <text start="364.89" dur="4.89">integrity and I stand on that I worked</text>
  <text start="368.07" dur="3.03">with my hands and my brain until I could</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="3.72">work with my integrity and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="3.81">this whole channel is about so you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="4.53">never catch me lying</text>
  <text start="374.91" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;ll never catch me you know in any</text>
  <text start="378.03" dur="3.45">sort of immoral behavior like that I</text>
  <text start="380.1" dur="1.95">mean I&amp;#39;m not perfect we all make</text>
  <text start="381.48" dur="3.63">mistakes</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="5.07">I have I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m sure that I get</text>
  <text start="385.11" dur="4.17">frustrated sometimes and I get kind of</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="3.93">snappy and grumpy and things like that</text>
  <text start="389.28" dur="4.98">especially if I don&amp;#39;t get enough sleep</text>
  <text start="391.05" dur="4.86">but you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t see me selling</text>
  <text start="394.26" dur="3.129">drugs to kids like I&amp;#39;m being accused of</text>
  <text start="395.91" dur="4.659">you don&amp;#39;t see me</text>
  <text start="397.389" dur="5.25">lying you know because usually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.569" dur="3.75">pretty easy you know what tangled webs</text>
  <text start="402.639" dur="3.15">we weave when first we practice to to</text>
  <text start="404.319" dur="3.32">see if it&amp;#39;s usually pretty easy to spot</text>
  <text start="405.789" dur="4.47">people for lying and once you&amp;#39;ve lied</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="4.75">like it&amp;#39;s gone it&amp;#39;s out there forever on</text>
  <text start="410.259" dur="3.78">the Internet and it&amp;#39;ll always haunt you</text>
  <text start="412.389" dur="4.051">and no one will ever really be able to</text>
  <text start="414.039" dur="4.44">trust you again so I just wanted to get</text>
  <text start="416.44" dur="4.08">this out there because hey I just got a</text>
  <text start="418.479" dur="3.66">lot of new eyeballs on me because of</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="4.41">what&amp;#39;s going on with Jack for sobic</text>
  <text start="422.139" dur="4.471">daxing me and thanks jack I appreciate</text>
  <text start="424.93" dur="5.1">that because now your entire audience</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="5.299">can determine whether or not your</text>
  <text start="430.03" dur="5.31">behavior is more moral than my behavior</text>
  <text start="431.909" dur="6.01">so you know I just wanted to get this</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="5.039">out there to clear any air or confusion</text>
  <text start="437.919" dur="4.021">because I did get one comment most of</text>
  <text start="440.379" dur="5.07">the comments are like Dustin&amp;#39;s a badass</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="5.4">or Dustin we all have a past and then</text>
  <text start="445.449" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re not gonna hold this against you</text>
  <text start="447.34" dur="4.169">well I do have a past I mean for sure if</text>
  <text start="450.219" dur="4.23">you look at my record it looks pretty</text>
  <text start="451.509" dur="6.69">bad but if you look at the context I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="454.449" dur="5.701">never heard anyone now that needs some</text>
  <text start="458.199" dur="3.991">clarification I did break some windows</text>
  <text start="460.15" dur="6.15">and I did still some calculators from my</text>
  <text start="462.19" dur="6.3">high school when I was 15 and it was</text>
  <text start="466.3" dur="3.869">stupid it was there was no excuse I mean</text>
  <text start="468.49" dur="4.979">I had a rough childhood growing up and I</text>
  <text start="470.169" dur="4.951">was kind of an angry teenager and I did</text>
  <text start="473.469" dur="2.7">dump all of that in a lake and the</text>
  <text start="475.12" dur="2.519">reason was they were trying to kick me</text>
  <text start="476.169" dur="5.31">out of high school for sleeping in class</text>
  <text start="477.639" dur="6">even though I was passing I made it easy</text>
  <text start="481.479" dur="3.78">on them I guess because I definitely got</text>
  <text start="483.639" dur="3.361">kicked out after that but this is the</text>
  <text start="485.259" dur="3.991">full context this is who I am this is</text>
  <text start="487" dur="3.93">this is part of me and there&amp;#39;s no point</text>
  <text start="489.25" dur="5.34">trying to like hide or cover that stuff</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="4.829">up so I&amp;#39;m not ashamed of it you know a</text>
  <text start="494.59" dur="2.759">15 years old</text>
  <text start="495.759" dur="4.321">everyone&amp;#39;s entitled to a few mistakes</text>
  <text start="497.349" dur="5.91">and I more than paid my price to society</text>
  <text start="500.08" dur="6.299">you know and I more than paid back the</text>
  <text start="503.259" dur="5.581">expense however you know this was</text>
  <text start="506.379" dur="4.29">someone&amp;#39;s private or not this was</text>
  <text start="508.84" dur="3.27">someone&amp;#39;s property that I violated I</text>
  <text start="510.669" dur="2.61">guess it&amp;#39;s public property so it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="512.11" dur="4.08">correct to say it was private property</text>
  <text start="513.279" dur="4.351">but you know it&amp;#39;s wrong to violate other</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="3.18">people&amp;#39;s property it&amp;#39;s wrong to like</text>
  <text start="517.63" dur="3.719">break things it&amp;#39;s wrong to steal and I</text>
  <text start="519.37" dur="5.339">did these things when I was 15 years old</text>
  <text start="521.349" dur="4.891">and you know then they tried me as an</text>
  <text start="524.709" dur="4.62">adult and I spent a year in prison for</text>
  <text start="526.24" dur="4.89">it so you know the punishment did not</text>
  <text start="529.329" dur="3.571">necessarily meet the crime how</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="3.75">that time gave me a lot of time to catch</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="3.33">up on my reading and reflect and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="4.47">when I read Think and Grow Rich and</text>
  <text start="536.23" dur="5.1">decided to take take my life and and do</text>
