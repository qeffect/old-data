  <text start="338.23" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t know that they did an autopsy but</text>
  <text start="339.97" dur="5.07">from what I heard so far is that they</text>
  <text start="343.27" dur="5.64">could not determine that kind of poison</text>
  <text start="345.04" dur="7.92">so maybe that hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet or</text>
  <text start="348.91" dur="6.33">maybe they will or who knows what and</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="4.35">remember this was in Mexico City so it</text>
  <text start="355.24" dur="3.57">could have been the food but you know</text>

  <text start="367.09" dur="4.56">attacks on the authors since the book</text>
  <text start="369.34" dur="4.26">came out not only from the fake Magra</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="3.51">lies and smears trying to say we were</text>
  <text start="373.6" dur="4.2">copy writing the movement and things</text>
  <text start="375.16" dur="5.91">like that we&amp;#39;ve had the death threats</text>
  <text start="377.8" dur="6.6">I&amp;#39;ve received death threats we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="381.07" dur="4.409">just different weird things happening</text>
  <text start="384.4" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ve been attacked by the mainstream</text>
  <text start="385.479" dur="4.91">media we&amp;#39;ve now had a mysterious death</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="6.81">linked to the publisher her own husband</text>
  <text start="390.389" dur="8.701">so you know there&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="394.96" dur="4.13">anything to it but it&amp;#39;s all worth noting</text>
  <text start="404.55" dur="4.3">hyperbolic has a good question so you</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="5.34">guys may have heard a rumor about the</text>
  <text start="408.85" dur="6.12">Marines mobilizing there was an order</text>
  <text start="412.39" dur="5.49">about manpower policy and mobilization</text>
  <text start="414.97" dur="5.88">of the Reserve Component so that went</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="5.099">out I don&amp;#39;t know the full details about</text>
  <text start="420.85" dur="5.16">it maybe it was something that people</text>
  <text start="422.979" dur="4.771">read too much into but it could be</text>
  <text start="426.01" dur="3.96">something where they were just getting</text>
  <text start="427.75" dur="4.65">ready in case the Democrats tried to do</text>
  <text start="429.97" dur="3.81">some sort of coup d&amp;#39;etat I mean remember</text>
  <text start="432.4" dur="3.18">Rasheeda Talib is talking about</text>
  <text start="433.78" dur="5.22">arresting cabinet members so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="5.82">getting serious and if they were to</text>
  <text start="439" dur="4.62">arrest a bunch of cabinet members under</text>
  <text start="441.4" dur="3.72">the guise of a subpoena do you really</text>
  <text start="443.62" dur="2.609">think they&amp;#39;d let them go if they thought</text>
  <text start="445.12" dur="4.65">they could keep them and get away with</text>
  <text start="446.229" dur="6.151">it so that&amp;#39;s a scary thought that they</text>
  <text start="449.77" dur="4.14">are even gonna try to to and of course</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re gonna push this they have to</text>
  <text start="453.91" dur="4.47">guys remember it has to come to that</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="4.92">point the cause why the alternative for</text>
  <text start="458.38" dur="2.69">some of the players involved is treason</text>
  <text start="460.45" dur="3.14">and</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="4.77">being put in Gitmo or death a death by</text>
  <text start="463.59" dur="3.75">hanging or something so that means that</text>
  <text start="465.84" dur="4.23">they have to push it all the way to the</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="5.64">end all the way to the full escalation</text>
  <text start="470.07" dur="5.04">to try to actually overthrow this</text>
  <text start="472.98" dur="3.72">president because somebody has to go</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="6.24">down and they don&amp;#39;t want it to be that</text>
  <text start="476.7" dur="6.63">their only way out is through him and</text>
  <text start="481.35" dur="4.62">he&amp;#39;s just standing there just not</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="5.28">letting them escape and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind</text>

  <text start="659.509" dur="5.38">they&amp;#39;re not really for a long time the</text>
  <text start="663.089" dur="3.961">only argument that the magnet people</text>
  <text start="664.889" dur="5.31">that supposedly mega people had against</text>
  <text start="667.05" dur="4.86">queue people was that they might sit at</text>

  <text start="671.91" dur="4.169">they thought he was gonna save the day</text>

  <text start="676.079" dur="4.021">no these people actually believe in</text>
  <text start="678.269" dur="3.57">child trafficking is a major issue these</text>
  <text start="680.1" dur="4.02">people actually support the president</text>

  <text start="697.41" dur="5.369">our president not because you know I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="706.68" dur="5.699">proponents so the idea that that queue</text>
  <text start="709.889" dur="4.231">people are gonna be lazy or stay out of</text>

  <text start="1638.04" dur="6.42">work so carbon 60 I don&amp;#39;t have the pill</text>
  <text start="1641.88" dur="6.42">form most people don&amp;#39;t do pills they do</text>
  <text start="1644.46" dur="5.97">oil droppers but carbon 60 itself is a</text>
  <text start="1648.3" dur="3.86">fascinating and I really mean</text>
  <text start="1650.43" dur="3.23">fascinating topic</text>
  <text start="1652.16" dur="4.53">I could get into a ramp but I&amp;#39;ll do the</text>
  <text start="1653.66" dur="4.8">short version in my opinion I like to</text>
  <text start="1656.69" dur="5.31">say it&amp;#39;s the most exciting thing since</text>
  <text start="1658.46" dur="6.62">antibiotics why to go down a few very</text>
  <text start="1662" dur="5.43">simple reasons to start at the top</text>
  <text start="1665.08" dur="4.6">longevity the most exciting thing in</text>
  <text start="1667.43" dur="4.44">longevity ever so they&amp;#39;ve already done</text>
  <text start="1669.68" dur="4.16">some research that if you if you do</text>
  <text start="1671.87" dur="4.38">fasting and you sort of starve yourself</text>
  <text start="1673.84" dur="4.84">of about thirty percent of your calories</text>
  <text start="1676.25" dur="4.83">you could extend your life maybe up to</text>
  <text start="1678.68" dur="5.19">about thirty percent you know in terms</text>
  <text start="1681.08" dur="5.01">of length it requires a like a kung-fu</text>
  <text start="1683.87" dur="3.93">state of mind and you have to basically</text>
  <text start="1686.09" dur="3.18">constantly be hungry and stuff to do</text>
  <text start="1687.8" dur="2.76">that and you have to do fasting and</text>
  <text start="1689.27" dur="4.83">intermittent fasting and all this other</text>
  <text start="1690.56" dur="5.52">stuff now with carbon 60 they did a</text>
  <text start="1694.1" dur="4.14">study on rats where they actually tried</text>
  <text start="1696.08" dur="4.98">to kill them they actually tried to give</text>
  <text start="1698.24" dur="5.94">them a toxic dose so they did a toxicity</text>
  <text start="1701.06" dur="4.53">test on the rats these are lab rats just</text>
  <text start="1704.18" dur="3.51">like with any other thing they do to</text>
  <text start="1705.59" dur="4.92">test for humans they always start with</text>
  <text start="1707.69" dur="5.58">the lab rats and these lab rats instead</text>
  <text start="1710.51" dur="4.59">of dying actually live to be 90 percent</text>
  <text start="1713.27" dur="4.56">longer almost a hundred percent longer</text>
  <text start="1715.1" dur="5.07">than their normal maximum lifespan so</text>
  <text start="1717.83" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s very exciting by itself right</text>
  <text start="1720.17" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s three times what you would get</text>
  <text start="1722.45" dur="5.91">from the the other approach you know</text>
  <text start="1725.09" dur="8.24">that&amp;#39;s amazing hey lishus good to see</text>
  <text start="1728.36" dur="4.97">you I&amp;#39;m gonna mod you you&amp;#39;re local</text>

  <text start="1747.41" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;m surprised pamphlet didn&amp;#39;t show up</text>
  <text start="1749.33" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s his backyard there but anyway back</text>
  <text start="1751.28" dur="5.28">to carbon 60 so real fast so not only</text>
  <text start="1754.94" dur="3.57">did it not kill the rats made him live</text>
  <text start="1756.56" dur="3.39">almost double their lifespan you know</text>
  <text start="1758.51" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s like a human living to be almost</text>
  <text start="1759.95" dur="7.14">180 and and you know I can&amp;#39;t make claims</text>
  <text start="1763.76" dur="6.18">or anything like that but this the lead</text>
  <text start="1767.09" dur="4.56">scientist in that study said safe at</text>
  <text start="1769.94" dur="4.41">high levels over long periods of time</text>
  <text start="1771.65" dur="5.06">and you know all mammals seem to be</text>
  <text start="1774.35" dur="6.27">getting a benefit from this stuff so</text>
  <text start="1776.71" dur="7.01">there&amp;#39;s also the anti-cancer antifungal</text>
  <text start="1780.62" dur="5.83">antimicrobial bacterial properties</text>
  <text start="1783.72" dur="4.199">it had a 16% hair regrowth in one study</text>
  <text start="1786.45" dur="3.209">where where people were rubbing it on</text>
  <text start="1787.919" dur="4.321">their their scalp for a few months when</text>
  <text start="1789.659" dur="5.01">they were balding it had noticeable</text>
  <text start="1792.24" dur="7.559">wrinkle repair after eight weeks in one</text>
  <text start="1794.669" dur="7.14">study and it also had 86% acne reduction</text>
  <text start="1799.799" dur="4.801">in another study so I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1801.809" dur="6.301">incredible so it&amp;#39;s also the strongest</text>
  <text start="1804.6" dur="6.809">antioxidant in the world 172 times</text>
  <text start="1808.11" dur="6.33">stronger than vitamin C and that means</text>
  <text start="1811.409" dur="5.911">anything that an antioxidant would help</text>
  <text start="1814.44" dur="5.729">like for example oxidative stress stuff</text>
  <text start="1817.32" dur="4.62">or in some cases a lot of people say it</text>
  <text start="1820.169" dur="4.64">helps with their vision things like that</text>
  <text start="1821.94" dur="7.68">so anything oxidative stress it helps</text>
  <text start="1824.809" dur="6.911">and that&amp;#39;s why carbon 60 is a its major</text>
  <text start="1829.62" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s bigger than CBD oil people just</text>
  <text start="1831.72" dur="4.23">haven&amp;#39;t figured that out yet caffeine</text>
  <text start="1834.57" dur="3.12">addict says will it help eye problems</text>
  <text start="1835.95" dur="3.329">the most common thing that I get back</text>
  <text start="1837.69" dur="5.13">from this and that I&amp;#39;ve heard from</text>
  <text start="1839.279" dur="6.811">reviews for anyone as far as carbon 60</text>
  <text start="1842.82" dur="5.13">goes is macular degeneration when you</text>
  <text start="1846.09" dur="4.26">get older your eyesight starts to go a</text>

  <text start="1885.179" dur="4.891">benefit from oral usage people mostly do</text>
  <text start="1887.669" dur="4.23">that but if you start to rub it on your</text>

  <text start="2146.18" dur="5.76">kind of to reiterate what I said earlier</text>
  <text start="2148.13" dur="6.3">for people who are just getting in when</text>
  <text start="2151.94" dur="5.52">Q was taken out supposedly for me you</text>
  <text start="2154.43" dur="4.439">know a Chan was taken down remember if</text>
  <text start="2157.46" dur="2.639">you go back to that time frame we were</text>

  <text start="2165.259" dur="4.711">was actually a good guy operation that</text>
  <text start="2167.15" dur="4.889">took down HN I think it was again a trap</text>
  <text start="2169.97" dur="5.339">because remember Jim Watkins shows up to</text>
  <text start="2172.039" dur="4.83">testify with a q pen and stuff and we</text>
  <text start="2175.309" dur="4.53">could we could have it back up at any</text>
  <text start="2176.869" dur="5.43">point in fact I know because I was I was</text>
  <text start="2179.839" dur="3.491">part of this story I actually contacted</text>
  <text start="2182.299" dur="2.651">code mom</text>
  <text start="2183.33" dur="3.57">he immediately as soon as a Chan was</text>
  <text start="2184.95" dur="4.17">taken down and I offered to help any way</text>
  <text start="2186.9" dur="5.12">I could and through some of my own</text>

  <text start="2202.02" dur="5.01">the tech field who could connect me to</text>
  <text start="2204.45" dur="5.25">one of the other companies so we had the</text>

  <text start="2209.7" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve actually chosen to remain down</text>
  <text start="2211.74" dur="6.06">on purpose that&amp;#39;s a strategy move I</text>
  <text start="2214.08" dur="5.28">think that if we had left a Chan up we</text>

  <text start="2242.55" dur="7.29">instinct opinion but it did stop in</text>

  <text start="2249.84" dur="6.48">it did stop the attempt of the MSM to to</text>

  <text start="2384.46" dur="5.129">causing so much drama and a waste of</text>
  <text start="2387.25" dur="4.92">time really frankly not that many people</text>

  <text start="2392.17" dur="3.419">people would actually show up and accept</text>
  <text start="2393.849" dur="4.531">the challenge to debate me on Q and on</text>
  <text start="2395.589" dur="4.681">so what I had what I had happened was a</text>
  <text start="2398.38" dur="3.51">bunch of drama people pretended that</text>

  <text start="2842.57" dur="3.96">demand because if shows like mine and</text>
  <text start="2845.12" dur="3.33">because of others who are selling carbon</text>

  <text start="2848.45" dur="6.81">the results people are getting you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2851.27" dur="6.45">actually able to have this explosive</text>

  <text start="2857.72" dur="4.32">making it now there&amp;#39;s a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="2859.37" dur="4.2">making it of various quality so you&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="2868.82" dur="3.84">lot of people that make it don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2870.29" dur="6.66">that so you have to be very careful in</text>
  <text start="2872.66" dur="6.81">this industry as well but it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2876.95" dur="4.17">fascinating kind of industry especially</text>
  <text start="2879.47" dur="3.87">if you compare it from a marketing</text>
  <text start="2881.12" dur="4.71">perspective to like CBD oil because CBD</text>
  <text start="2883.34" dur="4.92">is just taken off and this is like that</text>
  <text start="2885.83" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s just taken off people you know you</text>
  <text start="2888.26" dur="5.79">you you have more demand and supply on a</text>
  <text start="2891.68" dur="5.19">constant basis and it seems to be</text>
  <text start="2894.05" dur="5.13">actually going up again I was convinced</text>
  <text start="2896.87" dur="3.93">that demand would would eventually sort</text>
  <text start="2899.18" dur="3.51">of settle and supply would catch up</text>
  <text start="2900.8" dur="4.56">because so many businesses are starting</text>
  <text start="2902.69" dur="5.4">now that I figured it would just drive</text>
  <text start="2905.36" dur="4.53">the price back down but know that a lot</text>
  <text start="2908.09" dur="3.27">of the main suppliers are actually</text>
  <text start="2909.89" dur="2.22">raising it lately I&amp;#39;m trying to not</text>
  <text start="2911.36" dur="4.43">raise it here</text>
  <text start="2912.11" dur="5.43">so it is interesting in that sense I</text>
  <text start="2915.79" dur="2.47">don&amp;#39;t know if you guys have any other</text>
  <text start="2917.54" dur="3.15">questions</text>

  <text start="2920.69" dur="5.159">say how effective is sublingual the most</text>
  <text start="2924.59" dur="5.009">common way I see</text>
  <text start="2925.849" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;ll take c60 is like a spoon or a drop</text>
  <text start="2929.599" dur="5.281">or a day even like half an ounce or</text>
  <text start="2931.549" dur="6.601">something or half a spoon or spoon or</text>
