  <text start="282.1" dur="3.99">Ryan was another but there are thousands</text>
  <text start="284.2" dur="3.75">of examples of this so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="5.549">interesting that you see sealed</text>
  <text start="287.95" dur="9.149">indictment asset forfeiture all right</text>
  <text start="291.639" dur="6.87">this is a combination effect of the</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="3.361">executive order so you see these three</text>
  <text start="298.509" dur="4.741">things coming together sold indictment</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="4.859">you see the executive order and you see</text>
  <text start="303.25" dur="3.449">the civil asset forfeiture to go along</text>
  <text start="305.319" dur="3.09">with it for those involved in human</text>
  <text start="306.699" dur="4.231">rights trafficking and this was yeah</text>
  <text start="308.409" dur="4.831">this was a guy over there in South Korea</text>
  <text start="310.93" dur="5.039">maybe we can even steal their resort you</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="4.29">know I mean technically yes steal like</text>
  <text start="315.969" dur="3.871">or take back or whatever you want to do</text>
  <text start="317.53" dur="5.159">but maybe we can seize their assets</text>
  <text start="319.84" dur="6.18">worldwide now so this is very very</text>
  <text start="322.689" dur="4.861">interesting executive order 1 3 8 1 8 so</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="3.03">I want you guys to be aware of this</text>
  <text start="327.55" dur="3.51">because if you&amp;#39;re following queueing on</text>
  <text start="329.05" dur="3.66">if you&amp;#39;re following any of the stuff</text>
  <text start="331.06" dur="4.379">that&amp;#39;s been happening in the last two</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="5.1">three years you&amp;#39;ve been waiting for some</text>
  <text start="335.439" dur="3.75">for some action you&amp;#39;ve been waiting for</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="3.329">some arrests and things like that and</text>
  <text start="339.189" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s been so many things behind the</text>
  <text start="341.139" dur="3.721">scenes there&amp;#39;s been the hueber</text>
  <text start="342.909" dur="3.391">investigations there&amp;#39;s been John Durham</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="3.239">there&amp;#39;s been some of the stuff that</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="3.72">sessions got rolling people were</text>
  <text start="348.099" dur="4.051">thinking sessions didn&amp;#39;t do anything but</text>
  <text start="350.02" dur="3.69">remember he got Hubert going and now</text>
  <text start="352.15" dur="4.199">there&amp;#39;s so many other things and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.71" dur="4.799">so many of these little back-end steps</text>
  <text start="356.349" dur="4.56">and trends and points that you would</text>
  <text start="358.509" dur="3.84">want to include in your your analysis</text>
  <text start="360.909" dur="3.951">but most people don&amp;#39;t hear about those</text>
  <text start="362.349" dur="4.47">things you know it&amp;#39;s a quiet</text>
  <text start="364.86" dur="3.1">investigation it&amp;#39;s a process and they</text>
  <text start="366.819" dur="2.46">don&amp;#39;t want a lot of information out</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="4.29">there about it because it could hurt</text>
  <text start="369.279" dur="5.1">their odds of the investigation so you</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="4.259">know ongoing investigation information</text>
  <text start="374.379" dur="4.051">is limited as you would expect it to be</text>
  <text start="376.509" dur="3.21">but we do have things that you slip</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="3.38">through the cracks we do have things</text>
  <text start="379.719" dur="5.13">like this where we see patterns</text>
  <text start="381.81" dur="4.389">establishing 100,000 no actually I think</text>
  <text start="384.849" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s way over a hundred thousand silver</text>
  <text start="386.199" dur="5.31">indictments now and we have so much more</text>
  <text start="388.659" dur="5.37">coming down the pipeline we also have</text>
  <text start="391.509" dur="5.78">speaking of child trafficking it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="394.029" dur="5.401">it&amp;#39;s been a lot in the news lately</text>
  <text start="397.289" dur="4.12">surprisingly and it&amp;#39;s even been making</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="3.389">the rounds through social media although</text>
  <text start="401.409" dur="4.051">I&amp;#39;m surprised it hasn&amp;#39;t been shut down</text>
  <text start="402.819" dur="4.35">by the algorithm completely but we have</text>
  <text start="405.46" dur="4.739">Philadelphia to investigate child</text>
  <text start="407.169" dur="5.161">welfare Department for illegal childhood</text>
  <text start="410.199" dur="4.02">seizures all right so we have multiple</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="4.29">states male remember I already talked</text>
  <text start="414.219" dur="4.141">about Arizona where a GOP senator is</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="3.81">actually kind of bringing attention to</text>
  <text start="418.36" dur="4.2">this issue and good luck for him I hope</text>
  <text start="420.43" dur="5.04">he doesn&amp;#39;t disappear with the Clintons</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="6.09">but we have now states investing</text>
  <text start="425.47" dur="6.42">CPS departments for human trafficking</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="6.06">child trafficking industrial scale in</text>
  <text start="431.89" dur="4.62">some cases trafficking of children so</text>
  <text start="434.71" dur="3.63">you know we are we&amp;#39;re seeing these</text>
  <text start="436.51" dur="4.65">departments engaged in a for-profit</text>
  <text start="438.34" dur="6.06">business to turn out kids to whoever can</text>
  <text start="441.16" dur="5.97">buy and hopefully we&amp;#39;re seeing the end</text>
  <text start="444.4" dur="4.56">of it now Trump says the US will not get</text>
  <text start="447.13" dur="4.56">involved in fighting between Turkey and</text>
  <text start="448.96" dur="5.01">Syria now of course since then we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="451.69" dur="3.9">pulled out everyone made a big deal</text>
  <text start="453.97" dur="3.27">about including Romney and then they had</text>
  <text start="455.59" dur="3.42">a ceasefire agreement after Trump</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="3.39">threatened the guys so you know we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="459.01" dur="4.14">need to be over there in the middle of</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="3.66">two big armies with like 30 or 40 troops</text>
  <text start="463.15" dur="3.51">we don&amp;#39;t need to be over there at all</text>
  <text start="464.29" dur="4.83">playing police officer and Trump is</text>
  <text start="466.66" dur="4.26">right it&amp;#39;s not our fight we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="3.57">to be there pulling the troops out</text>
  <text start="470.92" dur="4.89">getting the troops home was a big part</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="4.68">of you know the last 10 20 years I</text>
  <text start="475.81" dur="3.06">remember you could say something like</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="3.06">that and everybody kind of was like yeah</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="4.86">I want to bring the troops on except for</text>
  <text start="480.43" dur="5.85">the the war mongering neo-cons but other</text>
  <text start="483.73" dur="4.05">than that now everybody seems to have</text>
  <text start="486.28" dur="3.3">turned on the idea because Trump</text>
  <text start="487.78" dur="3.45">supports it now of course the people</text>
