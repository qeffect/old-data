  <text start="49.7" dur="3.269">apologize for you know being away for a</text>
  <text start="51.44" dur="3.66">few days I&amp;#39;ve been kind of stuck in</text>
  <text start="52.969" dur="4.351">airplanes and travel mode for a day I</text>
  <text start="55.1" dur="4.5">came back to New Hampshire to visit some</text>
  <text start="57.32" dur="3.84">some close friends and family and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="59.6" dur="4.5">kind of a rotation I don&amp;#39;t really get to</text>
  <text start="61.16" dur="5.819">take real vacations but you know family</text>
  <text start="64.1" dur="6.269">is enjoying seeing Athena at least so</text>
  <text start="66.979" dur="5.28">beyond that we are gonna move into and</text>
  <text start="70.369" dur="3.121">and obviously the new background and</text>
  <text start="72.259" dur="4.2">stuff I&amp;#39;m actually sitting in my bed</text>
  <text start="73.49" dur="6.299">right now I&amp;#39;m not an office anyway let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.459" dur="6.51">dive into some of the news so you guys</text>
  <text start="79.789" dur="5.07">may remember this guy he actually was</text>
  <text start="82.969" dur="4.17">with Epstein this is Nicolas Hart</text>
  <text start="84.859" dur="4.381">Taglioni I think it is and he was like</text>
  <text start="87.139" dur="4.01">an ex-cop who had been put in there for</text>
  <text start="89.24" dur="4.409">murder like kind of a big muscle head</text>
  <text start="91.149" dur="6.731">not a nice guy according to those who</text>
  <text start="93.649" dur="6.57">know him but he says that or he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="97.88" dur="4.259">begging to be moved to a new prison</text>
  <text start="100.219" dur="4.65">after his prison guards have been</text>
  <text start="102.139" dur="4.5">threatening him so this guy may or may</text>
  <text start="104.869" dur="4.38">not have something to say about the</text>
  <text start="106.639" dur="4.14">Epstein death now what does that mean</text>
  <text start="109.249" dur="3.18">that means that those prison guards who</text>
  <text start="110.779" dur="3.21">are not cooperating with the DOJ by the</text>
  <text start="112.429" dur="4.381">way and who were there when I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="113.989" dur="4.77">was killed mysteriously or taken out you</text>
  <text start="116.81" dur="4.32">know off the prison or whatever it may</text>
  <text start="118.759" dur="3.96">be these folks have something to hide</text>
  <text start="121.13" dur="4.32">and they&amp;#39;re threatening this guy and</text>
  <text start="122.719" dur="4.29">they have 100% total power over him what</text>
  <text start="125.45" dur="3.089">could he possibly do to defend himself</text>
  <text start="127.009" dur="2.851">from prison guards they could put</text>
  <text start="128.539" dur="2.521">something in there and frame him they</text>
  <text start="129.86" dur="4.89">could beat him up they could kill him</text>
  <text start="131.06" dur="5.73">and say it was a suicide I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="134.75" dur="3.9">particularly care about the sky or like</text>
  <text start="136.79" dur="3.42">him but if he has something to say about</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="4.47">Epstein and they don&amp;#39;t move him out of</text>
  <text start="140.21" dur="5.4">this prison someone&amp;#39;s in on it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="5.1">all I&amp;#39;ve got to say now continuing on we</text>
  <text start="145.61" dur="5.13">also have and this is kind of a possible</text>
  <text start="148.22" dur="4.71">big deal maybe not it depends really on</text>
  <text start="150.74" dur="4.41">I think it&amp;#39;s a big deal it depends on</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="4.71">how people take it right I see you</text>
  <text start="155.15" dur="5.7">scroll back up what happened so Seth</text>
  <text start="157.64" dur="5.46">rich murder update now the FBI claims</text>
  <text start="160.85" dur="3.9">that they did not investigate but the</text>
  <text start="163.1" dur="3.45">NSA claims that they cannot disclose</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="4.8">files and due to mash a matter of</text>
  <text start="166.55" dur="5.55">national security so on the one hand</text>
  <text start="169.55" dur="4.05">that means that there&amp;#39;s been an</text>
  <text start="172.1" dur="3.39">investigation there&amp;#39;s been some stuff</text>
  <text start="173.6" dur="5.04">and it&amp;#39;s bad and they can&amp;#39;t let it out</text>
  <text start="175.49" dur="4.83">and the FBI is maybe just lying to us or</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="2.76">possibly they don&amp;#39;t have it because</text>
  <text start="180.32" dur="2.34">maybe they never really did an</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="2.16">investigation because they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="182.66" dur="4.08">to uncover the truth</text>
  <text start="183.56" dur="5.67">but maybe the NSA has it any they get it</text>
  <text start="186.74" dur="4.95">all you know it&amp;#39;s automated it&amp;#39;s passive</text>
  <text start="189.23" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the internet of things the NSA</text>
  <text start="191.69" dur="5.79">sits there like a spider at the center</text>
  <text start="194.209" dur="5.431">of the web now they would obviously have</text>
  <text start="197.48" dur="4.979">things that the FBI didn&amp;#39;t have access</text>
  <text start="199.64" dur="5.129">to even the CIA might not have access to</text>
  <text start="202.459" dur="5.101">things like this because of course there</text>
  <text start="204.769" dur="5.25">is a internal war in our deep state</text>
  <text start="207.56" dur="4.29">between the NSA and the CIA and that is</text>
  <text start="210.019" dur="4.081">kind of what this q battle has been all</text>
  <text start="211.85" dur="6.15">about the NSA has been taken over by the</text>
  <text start="214.1" dur="7.139">good guys but anyway so this was to me a</text>
  <text start="218" dur="5.4">pretty big piece of information at least</text>
  <text start="221.239" dur="3.631">it could potentially be I&amp;#39;m sure Matt</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="2.88">couch will be all over this with his</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="3.54">investigations into the Southridge</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="3.54">murder which by the way remember gag</text>
  <text start="228.41" dur="3.54">order he&amp;#39;s not even allowed to talk</text>
  <text start="229.82" dur="5.07">about what they&amp;#39;re doing to him so you</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="6">know be sure to let him know Dustin emo</text>
  <text start="234.89" dur="6.48">said hey and since you know support</text>
  <text start="237.95" dur="5.7">because I&amp;#39;m surprised that that guy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.37" dur="4.58">still alive honestly Matt couch is brave</text>
  <text start="243.65" dur="5.04">dude for going after that investigation</text>
  <text start="245.95" dur="4.39">developing dr. mark Segal Jeffrey</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="5.43">Epstein suffered hemorrhaging and the</text>
  <text start="250.34" dur="5.76">neck a sign of homicide so further he</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="4.23">goes down here and he says the hyoid</text>
  <text start="256.1" dur="4.23">bone might break in strangulation about</text>
  <text start="258.35" dur="4.98">one third to one half of the time and</text>
  <text start="260.33" dur="5.76">suicide hanging it might break 6 to 10</text>
  <text start="263.33" dur="3.959">percent of the time much depending on</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="1.99">which study you look at much less</text>
  <text start="267.289" dur="3.181">percentage</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="5.489">but in order to break that bone and</text>
  <text start="270.47" dur="5.439">multiple bones in the neck you have to</text>
  <text start="273.569" dur="4.231">exert a lot of force if it&amp;#39;s a hanging I</text>
  <text start="275.909" dur="3.961">don&amp;#39;t want to get graphic here but he</text>
  <text start="277.8" dur="4.709">supposedly hung himself off a bunk bed</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="5.94">with sheets I&amp;#39;m thinking more a rope</text>
  <text start="282.509" dur="5.28">with height now that is exactly the case</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="5.31">because you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t jump off a</text>
  <text start="287.789" dur="6.66">bunk bed for one or a bed you know you</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="5.82">know a just a bunk in prison you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.449" dur="4.231">jump off of that and go anywhere you</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="3.599">just hit the floor to pretty low down</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="5.519">and you&amp;#39;re not gonna like get the kind</text>
  <text start="300.539" dur="6.81">of force that you need now if you took a</text>
  <text start="304.199" dur="4.831">running you know 30 - 30 foot - or</text>
  <text start="307.349" dur="3.63">something and then had a rope around</text>
  <text start="309.03" dur="3.72">your neck maybe that would do it or</text>
  <text start="310.979" dur="3.361">maybe if you fell from a good 10 feet</text>
  <text start="312.75" dur="2.969">like they used to do in hangings where</text>
  <text start="314.34" dur="3.389">the floor would fall from beneath you</text>
  <text start="315.719" dur="5.13">and you&amp;#39;ve seen it in the movies then</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="4.891">that you just kind of strangle on the</text>
  <text start="320.849" dur="3.241">rope unless one of your buddies cut it</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="3.509">and there&amp;#39;s a miraculous escape at the</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="4.259">end seems to be what happened with</text>
  <text start="326.129" dur="6.361">Epstein here at least anyway continuing</text>
  <text start="328.349" dur="8.37">on a new study links fluoride to lower</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="5.609">IQs now I&amp;#39;ve been talking about fluoride</text>
  <text start="336.719" dur="3.031">since I started YouTube I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="338.099" dur="4.011">talking about fluoride to everyone that</text>
  <text start="339.75" dur="7.83">would listen to me for my entire life</text>
  <text start="342.11" dur="9.1">and for ideas a toxic toxic toxic</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="7.769">chemical not only is it a byproduct</text>
  <text start="351.21" dur="7.829">waste okay not only that not only they</text>
  <text start="355.349" dur="5.641">transport it in in waste disposal kind</text>
  <text start="359.039" dur="3.481">of things like if you like hazmat</text>
  <text start="360.99" dur="3.149">standard if you spill this stuff you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="4.47">supposed to call in hazmat team it like</text>
  <text start="364.139" dur="4.291">they have safety regulations for</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="4.41">touching it until it goes into your</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="4.38">water supply so that is exactly what we</text>
  <text start="371.4" dur="4.199">are dealing with here now it&amp;#39;s as bad</text>
  <text start="372.81" dur="4.77">for your brain as lead doesn&amp;#39;t kill you</text>
  <text start="375.599" dur="3.511">like let does it just makes you stupid</text>
  <text start="377.58" dur="5.97">makes you not care as much it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="5.58">perfect drug for a population when</text>
  <text start="383.55" dur="2.339">you&amp;#39;re the government you want to keep</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="5.31">them dumb and docile</text>
  <text start="385.889" dur="6.03">it creates apathy and it destroys your</text>
  <text start="390" dur="5.879">intelligence in a permanent fashion by</text>
  <text start="391.919" dur="7.05">lowering IQ so when the children will</text>
  <text start="395.879" dur="4.59">see the study conducted with 512</text>
  <text start="398.969" dur="2.871">pregnant women recruited from six</text>
  <text start="400.469" dur="3.531">Canadian cities</text>
  <text start="401.84" dur="4.23">several methods to measure exposure to</text>
  <text start="404" dur="4.53">fluoride analyzing the amount of</text>
  <text start="406.07" dur="3.99">fluoride fluoride in their urine looking</text>
  <text start="408.53" dur="3.359">at how much tap water and tea they drink</text>
  <text start="410.06" dur="5.34">and comparing the fluoride concentration</text>
  <text start="411.889" dur="5.34">in the community drinking water and a</text>
  <text start="415.4" dur="4.47">follow up when the children were three</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="7.351">or four the research team performed IQ</text>
  <text start="419.87" dur="6.66">tests we just happened to detect a</text>
  <text start="424.58" dur="3.839">correlation and mothers whose urine</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="3.96">contained a one milligram per liter</text>
  <text start="428.419" dur="6.211">increase in fluoride concentrations</text>
  <text start="430.49" dur="7.71">their children&amp;#39;s IQ was 4.5 points lower</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="6.18">among boys boys of mothers with the most</text>
  <text start="438.2" dur="7.11">fluoride in their urine had an IQ around</text>
  <text start="440.81" dur="8.28">three points lower than mothers with the</text>
  <text start="445.31" dur="6.03">least amount we saw an association</text>
  <text start="449.09" dur="6.51">between prenatal fluoride exposure and</text>
  <text start="451.34" dur="9.299">lower IQs and children so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.6" dur="8.069">looking at here is that half an eye you</text>
  <text start="460.639" dur="4.621">know 10 IQ points for example if you</text>
  <text start="463.669" dur="5.401">give someone an extra two nine cue</text>
  <text start="465.26" dur="5.64">points they&amp;#39;re gonna make ten times the</text>
  <text start="469.07" dur="4.23">income in their life I think this I</text>
  <text start="470.9" dur="5.94">cannot remember the metric but this is a</text>
  <text start="473.3" dur="4.71">study that came out and I mentioned it</text>
  <text start="476.84" dur="5.67">recently actually in a different video</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="6.51">but they will actually times ten their</text>
  <text start="482.51" dur="3.36">income now this is just based on money</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="2.79">and that&amp;#39;s just kind of one metric cuz</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s not the real measure of life</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="5.49">success but you know it&amp;#39;s a measure</text>
  <text start="490.13" dur="4.14">right because money helps to avoid all</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="3.36">the headaches that come with not having</text>
  <text start="494.27" dur="5.61">money you know I just there&amp;#39;s other</text>

  <text start="617.639" dur="5.25">this election Trump says he can issue a</text>
  <text start="620.279" dur="6.211">capital gains tax cut with an executive</text>
  <text start="622.889" dur="5.43">order so we basically have president</text>
  <text start="626.49" dur="3.209">Trump looking at a couple of tax cuts</text>
  <text start="628.319" dur="3.661">here I think he was actually looking at</text>
  <text start="629.699" dur="4.14">a payroll tax and a capital gains tax we</text>
  <text start="631.98" dur="6">says we&amp;#39;re always looking at capital</text>
  <text start="633.839" dur="5.401">gains tax and payroll tax now he says I</text>
  <text start="637.98" dur="3.15">would love to do something on capital</text>
  <text start="639.24" dur="3.149">gains so he&amp;#39;s probably add again yeah we</text>
  <text start="641.13" dur="2.91">get your payroll and then I&amp;#39;d love to</text>
  <text start="642.389" dur="3.841">also do something in capital gains the</text>
  <text start="644.04" dur="3.63">problem of course it&amp;#39;s a little harder</text>
  <text start="646.23" dur="5.19">to sell because most people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="647.67" dur="6.75">understand capital gains how it might</text>
  <text start="651.42" dur="4.68">help them okay so for example capital</text>
  <text start="654.42" dur="2.82">gains is when you like sell a house or</text>
  <text start="656.1" dur="3.69">you sell something you you know</text>
  <text start="657.24" dur="5.49">big-ticket items right and you make a</text>
  <text start="659.79" dur="5.07">little bit of a profit you know -</text>
  <text start="662.73" dur="3.54">whatever your your debt inflation all</text>
  <text start="664.86" dur="3.03">the other stuff</text>
  <text start="666.27" dur="4.08">so capital gains can be useful for an</text>
  <text start="667.89" dur="3.99">investor or even if you bought like a</text>
  <text start="670.35" dur="3.15">silver coin and you sold it when it</text>
  <text start="671.88" dur="5.75">doubled and you made like an extra ten</text>
  <text start="673.5" dur="6.87">fifteen bucks that&amp;#39;s a capital gain but</text>
  <text start="677.63" dur="4.21">the way that it affects the normal folks</text>
  <text start="680.37" dur="5.07">and they don&amp;#39;t see it because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="681.84" dur="6.18">little bit vague and a nuanced for</text>
  <text start="685.44" dur="4.46">example when you have to pay a lot of</text>
  <text start="688.02" dur="4.32">taxes on selling and flipping houses</text>
  <text start="689.9" dur="5.14">buying a house becomes much more</text>
  <text start="692.34" dur="5.01">expensive and we are looking at that now</text>
  <text start="695.04" dur="6.93">everyone wants to buy a house and then</text>
  <text start="697.35" dur="7.35">home prices and home sales are imploding</text>
  <text start="701.97" dur="4.53">the real estate bubble part of the</text>
  <text start="704.7" dur="5.34">everything bubble stocks bonds and real</text>
  <text start="706.5" dur="7.86">estate the real estate bubble is popping</text>
  <text start="710.04" dur="6.81">as we speak in this country that will be</text>
  <text start="714.36" dur="6.03">as real estate always is very area</text>
  <text start="716.85" dur="6.54">dependent but it&amp;#39;s happening for example</text>
  <text start="720.39" dur="5.34">what&amp;#39;s happening in Florida so just want</text>
  <text start="723.39" dur="5.19">you guys to know about this like a tax</text>
  <text start="725.73" dur="4.5">cut is always good for the people even</text>
  <text start="728.58" dur="3.06">if it&amp;#39;s not a tax cut for that person</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="2.85">because you&amp;#39;re gonna be doing business</text>
  <text start="731.64" dur="3.27">with those people who are getting tax</text>
  <text start="733.08" dur="3.18">cuts you&amp;#39;re gonna be wanting to buy a</text>
  <text start="734.91" dur="3.15">house you&amp;#39;re gonna be wanting to buy</text>
  <text start="736.26" dur="5.22">something that they had to pay more for</text>
  <text start="738.06" dur="5.34">and sell more for to you it sell to a</text>
  <text start="741.48" dur="4.41">higher price to you because they have so</text>
  <text start="743.4" dur="4.71">many expenses the government doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="745.89" dur="4.26">really help anyone they get in the way</text>
  <text start="748.11" dur="3.54">they break your leg they sell you a</text>
  <text start="750.15" dur="3.63">wheelchair that probably needs</text>
  <text start="751.65" dur="3.39">maintenance and repairs then they sell</text>
  <text start="753.78" dur="3.33">you the repairs and they don&amp;#39;t let you</text>
  <text start="755.04" dur="3.75">go to anyone else for it and then they</text>
  <text start="757.11" dur="4.98">tell you hey without us you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="758.79" dur="6.27">walked well without them you&amp;#39;d still</text>
  <text start="762.09" dur="5.07">have legs of your own so that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="765.06" dur="3.99">where we are with taxes and I love I</text>
  <text start="767.16" dur="3.9">love love love more than most anything</text>
  <text start="769.05" dur="3.48">else almost the President Trump is going</text>
  <text start="771.06" dur="3.63">after taxes because that is a direct</text>
  <text start="772.53" dur="4.5">freedom to the people that is a direct</text>
  <text start="774.69" dur="3.72">food and my child&amp;#39;s mouth that is a</text>
  <text start="777.03" dur="4.29">direct food in your child or your</text>
  <text start="778.41" dur="5.13">grandchild mouth that is increased</text>
  <text start="781.32" dur="4.29">resources for the people that can help</text>
  <text start="783.54" dur="3.27">their own families far better than the</text>
  <text start="785.61" dur="3.63">government ever could with those</text>
  <text start="786.81" dur="4.68">resources like I&amp;#39;ve never understood the</text>
  <text start="789.24" dur="4.17">idea of giving a dollar to the</text>
  <text start="791.49" dur="4.46">government and getting back quarter and</text>
  <text start="793.41" dur="4.98">feeling like you&amp;#39;ve got something done</text>
  <text start="795.95" dur="6.46">if you&amp;#39;re lucky a quarter</text>
  <text start="798.39" dur="5.31">probably like a 10% really that&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="802.41" dur="2.67">of corruption it has to go through when</text>
  <text start="803.7" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s a net just not much left for you</text>
  <text start="805.08" dur="5.46">after all the greed is such tit and we</text>
  <text start="807.66" dur="4.71">also have modeling agencies provide our</text>
