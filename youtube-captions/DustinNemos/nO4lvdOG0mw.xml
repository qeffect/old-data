  <text start="181.08" dur="4.98">is in the heat right now and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="9">exactly where they need to be now the</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="9.63">guy John Huber who is appointed to help</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="6.39">the IG in his investigation troop London</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="3.84">is suggesting that they he is basically</text>
  <text start="197.79" dur="6.09">a second Special Counsel and all but</text>
  <text start="199.53" dur="6.06">name and you know technically there is</text>
  <text start="203.88" dur="5.21">no law for special counsel anyway that</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="5.76">law was you know gone not renewed so</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="3.67">there&amp;#39;s no such thing as a special</text>
  <text start="211.35" dur="3.72">counsel even though we apparently have</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="5.039">one but this guy has the power to</text>
  <text start="215.07" dur="5.13">subpoena and you know convened grand</text>
  <text start="217.799" dur="7.951">juries all that stuff so he he can he</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="8.4">didn&amp;#39;t bring the the authority to compel</text>
  <text start="225.75" dur="7.35">people to testify under subpoena things</text>
  <text start="228.6" dur="6.63">like that so maybe it is a good move I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="233.1" dur="4.199">my original thought was maybe he was</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="3.9">just sessions was just doing something</text>
  <text start="237.299" dur="4.5">to act like he was doing something but</text>
  <text start="239.13" dur="4.259">it was really just a minor something</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="5.31">when we really wanted him to appoint a</text>
  <text start="243.389" dur="7.141">second Special Counsel but maybe this is</text>
  <text start="247.109" dur="6.811">part of the 3d chess I don&amp;#39;t know now</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="5.37">NBC was slammed for pushing the claim</text>
  <text start="253.92" dur="5.219">that Christian faith is used to defend</text>
  <text start="255.9" dur="4.769">white supremacy now some context the guy</text>
  <text start="259.139" dur="3.271">who wrote it claims to be Christian but</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="4.001">basically they&amp;#39;re trying to put the idea</text>
  <text start="262.41" dur="4.99">out there that Christian</text>
  <text start="264.67" dur="5.34">be ashamed and guilty for white</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="3.99">supremacist apparently also claiming to</text>
  <text start="270.01" dur="5.52">be Christian or something like that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="6.63">really ridiculous so I&amp;#39;ll just jump on</text>
  <text start="275.53" dur="5.22">just get past that it&amp;#39;s kind of a little</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="4.74">cultural blip something to piss you off</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="6.66">of the day right motivates you a little</text>
  <text start="282.76" dur="7.05">bit now the House Democrats turns out</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="6.96">waived the background checks for the</text>
  <text start="289.81" dur="6.6">Elan brothers a 44 House Democrats who</text>
  <text start="294.37" dur="4.17">use the services of the Pakistani IT</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="4.86">unit hired them and exempted them from</text>
  <text start="298.54" dur="5.1">background checks it should be noted</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="4.17">these IT employees worked with some of</text>
  <text start="303.64" dur="10.26">the most sensitive national security</text>
  <text start="305.44" dur="10.92">secrets and and in climate change world</text>
  <text start="313.9" dur="6.75">now this is still a topic a lot of</text>
  <text start="316.36" dur="6.09">people believe strongly about even</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="3.57">people on our side oftentimes believe</text>
  <text start="322.45" dur="6.14">that climate change is real</text>
  <text start="324.22" dur="7.92">so cat hair I run a zoo here I really do</text>
  <text start="328.59" dur="5.35">this guy is like really affectionate and</text>
  <text start="332.14" dur="3.57">really loves me and he&amp;#39;s just like being</text>
  <text start="333.94" dur="3.39">cuddly in my lap right now but he keeps</text>
  <text start="335.71" dur="6.38">hitting the desk and moving hair in my</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="4.76">face and everything else anyway</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="4.6">so where was I</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="4.2">the climate alarmists now a while back I</text>
  <text start="348.49" dur="4.32">reported that some of the cities of</text>
  <text start="350.38" dur="4.47">California were basically suing the oil</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="5.13">companies right the big oil some of the</text>
  <text start="354.85" dur="4.02">big oil companies and I thought it was</text>
  <text start="357.94" dur="3.06">interesting because they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="4.32">all on the same team trying to push the</text>
  <text start="361" dur="3.3">idea of global warming but the oil</text>
  <text start="363.19" dur="3.75">companies have something to actually</text>
  <text start="364.3" dur="4.95">lose in this so maybe they&amp;#39;ll actually</text>
  <text start="366.94" dur="4.62">stand up and do some some some real</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="4.77">defense the only way that they could</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="4.68">lose this is if they they take a hint</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="4.74">take a dive you know they intentionally</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="4.77">lose apparently even though it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="378.76" dur="5.52">California judge he is kind of known for</text>
  <text start="381.01" dur="5.79">really looking into stuff actually</text>
  <text start="384.28" dur="4.77">looking into things and he&amp;#39;s went so far</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="4.92">as to learn coding when he had a Google</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="4.7">lawsuit things like that so maybe he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="391.72" dur="4.28">do the same with this you know</text>
  <text start="393.75" dur="5.31">political issue I don&amp;#39;t know California</text>
  <text start="396" dur="6">tends to be very political so maybe he</text>
  <text start="399.06" dur="5.88">won&amp;#39;t stick to the same standards when</text>
  <text start="402" dur="5.06">it comes to a political issue but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="404.94" dur="4.68">gonna quote from the article here Israel</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="5.14">sorry count was hitting the desk and</text>
  <text start="409.62" dur="6.47">just started another video so basically</text>
  <text start="412.2" dur="3.89">the climate alarmists have until now</text>
  <text start="416.21" dur="4.81">avoided debate and trials largely</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="6.13">debates always tend to go very badly for</text>
  <text start="421.02" dur="5.67">them and they&amp;#39;re setting themselves up</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="3.78">for like a big failure here with</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="3.72">approvable like in the courts it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.52" dur="3.18">scenario which you know generally they</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="3.09">they don&amp;#39;t like that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="431.7" dur="3.39">climate alarmists like they tend to just</text>
  <text start="433.5" dur="3.54">make fun of you rather than to bait you</text>
  <text start="435.09" dur="3.66">with actual facts so they tend to to</text>
  <text start="437.04" dur="3.03">throw pseudoscience but they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="438.75" dur="4.32">really back it up in like a court of law</text>
  <text start="440.07" dur="5.19">situation the downside is that big oil</text>
  <text start="443.07" dur="4.47">is also heavily invested in the global</text>
  <text start="445.26" dur="4.5">warming scam so I don&amp;#39;t know you&amp;#39;d think</text>
  <text start="447.54" dur="3.93">that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be but you know it</text>

  <text start="454.08" dur="4.17">from the article up until now the</text>
  <text start="456.54" dur="3.72">alarmists have understood this it&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="4.49">they roll the way they do preferring to</text>
