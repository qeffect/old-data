  <text start="111.54" dur="3.539">you&amp;#39;ve been around my channel for any</text>
  <text start="113.07" dur="4.74">length of time you know this has been my</text>
  <text start="115.079" dur="4.951">primary focus with the Q movement since</text>
  <text start="117.81" dur="4.32">the beginning where we go when we go all</text>
  <text start="120.03" dur="4.53">not only as a philosophy but more</text>
  <text start="122.13" dur="6.239">recently also as a tactic we pioneered</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="6.21">this with the Q book a phenomenon a red</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="4.261">pill book for the masses sort of an art</text>
  <text start="130.77" dur="4.86">of war for the digital era</text>
  <text start="132.63" dur="5.13">but we did that as a team and we broke</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="4.14">through with just a few of us that proof</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="4.26">of concept now lends itself to</text>
  <text start="139.77" dur="3.87">everything that we do as a team and if</text>
  <text start="142.02" dur="3.72">12 of us could do that what can a</text>
  <text start="143.64" dur="4.89">hundred of us do against Google what can</text>
  <text start="145.74" dur="5.79">a thousand of us do if we pull together</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="5.46">and unite and we don&amp;#39;t have to agree on</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="4.74">everything but we can certainly agree on</text>
  <text start="153.99" dur="5.4">the fact that people should be allowed</text>
  <text start="156.27" dur="4.86">to speak people should have the right to</text>
  <text start="159.39" dur="3.87">say their piece they should have the</text>
  <text start="161.13" dur="4.83">right to make their argument they should</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="4.49">not be censor they should not be cut out</text>
  <text start="165.96" dur="4.82">they should not be punished for</text>
  <text start="167.75" dur="5.65">exercising their right to an opinion</text>
  <text start="170.78" dur="4.21">that is what free will and free speech</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="5.01">and the First Amendment of this country</text>
