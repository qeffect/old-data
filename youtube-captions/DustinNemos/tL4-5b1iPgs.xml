  <text start="268.14" dur="4.62">Watkins was grilled before the House</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="5.19">testimony are you know hearing we had to</text>
  <text start="272.76" dur="3.99">testify and they sort of just tried to</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="3.18">like get a metered that they could on</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="3.51">him there wasn&amp;#39;t much there it only</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="3.18">makes like $12,000 a year with that</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="4.11">entire website so it&amp;#39;s not like a</text>
  <text start="281.64" dur="4.71">Twitter or something like that and it</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="4.95">you know at this point he he even had a</text>
  <text start="286.35" dur="6.96">cue pen on his shirt when he went into</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="5.67">this so I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty bunch</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="4.95">blatant at that point I would call that</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="4.83">to be sort of I would call that bragging</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="3.81">I wouldn&amp;#39;t I would also call that an</text>
  <text start="299.82" dur="4.53">allegiance thing to he went in there</text>
  <text start="302.07" dur="4.23">just sort of showing off and then he</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="4.02">went into an interview with chat log</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="3.45">specific if you guys remember him I</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="3.96">certainly do</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="5.34">he he didn&amp;#39;t ask a single question of</text>
  <text start="312.33" dur="4.92">helped about Q Diddy so that was kind of</text>
  <text start="315.09" dur="4.829">funny so you&amp;#39;re starting to see the</text>
  <text start="317.25" dur="4.59">whole darn thing their credibility is</text>
  <text start="319.919" dur="4.141">straining right and that&amp;#39;s the same with</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="6.39">fake news with the exception of Fox</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="5.94">which finally finally were going after</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="3.78">Fox I would say finally because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="330" dur="4.77">been to all about going after fake Magga</text>
  <text start="332.01" dur="4.29">the entire movement but Fox is the</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="3.6">biggest of all you know they tried to</text>
  <text start="336.3" dur="3.69">destroy our chances at the midterms and</text>
  <text start="338.37" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re no friend of President Trump</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="4.62">they&amp;#39;re the ultimate fake Magha</text>
  <text start="342.36" dur="4.53">and unfortunately now they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="4.05">biggest target in the room because we</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="3.48">the people have done the job of</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="7.59">destroying the credibility for the left</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="7.35">so Fox is next I guess and it&amp;#39;s good to</text>
  <text start="356.25" dur="3.09">see president Trump making statements</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="5.49">like that too like finding someone else</text>
  <text start="359.34" dur="6.03">to watch instead of Fox you know he</text>
  <text start="363.21" dur="7.26">likes epoch times and things like that</text>
  <text start="365.37" dur="6.06">so anyway yeah you know everyone still</text>
  <text start="370.47" dur="3.45">watches like whatever</text>
  <text start="371.43" dur="4.17">on TV and then my poor grandmother</text>
  <text start="373.92" dur="3.15">she&amp;#39;ll just like kind of watch stuff and</text>
  <text start="375.6" dur="5.76">fall asleep you know she&amp;#39;s retired now</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="5.97">but um it&amp;#39;s always Fox if she&amp;#39;s watching</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="2.82">any news it&amp;#39;s always Fox and I go over</text>
  <text start="383.04" dur="4.2">there I&amp;#39;m like this is where they get it</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="7.92">wrong this is I&amp;#39;m no fun for for</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="6.33">Thanksgiving at all anyway you guys know</text>
  <text start="392.1" dur="3.15">that feeling right like your family is</text>
  <text start="393.57" dur="2.04">just no more politics I don&amp;#39;t wanna hear</text>
  <text start="395.25" dur="2.43">it</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="3.27">or they&amp;#39;re on the left if the end you</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="5.1">know fortunately I didn&amp;#39;t have too much</text>
  <text start="398.88" dur="8.93">of that couple crazy cousins that ended</text>
  <text start="402.78" dur="8.93">up miserable cat people unfortunately</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="6.67">but the leftist politics will ruin you</text>
  <text start="411.71" dur="4.06">so if you guys are gonna be going I see</text>
  <text start="414.48" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s a few more folks in here now if</text>

  <text start="487.44" dur="5.07">when they do the live stream as soon as</text>
  <text start="489.72" dur="5.54">I find out a good link or something and</text>
  <text start="492.51" dur="2.75">I&amp;#39;ll tweet it as well</text>
  <text start="498.78" dur="4.99">Roberto you&amp;#39;re probably not the only and</text>
  <text start="501.31" dur="4.05">cap in your city buddy because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="503.77" dur="3.96">lot of folks out there that have the</text>
  <text start="505.36" dur="3.87">belief system of like the Ron Paul but</text>
  <text start="507.73" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t realize that they&amp;#39;re in an cap</text>
  <text start="509.23" dur="4.92">yeah I would say that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="511.99" dur="3.479">the majority if you set him down and</text>
  <text start="514.15" dur="5.97">talk to him about it if they had the</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="8.341">time to discuss such things I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="5.76">think you&amp;#39;re gonna see Obama die strange</text>
  <text start="523.81" dur="4.14">way to phrase it however no violence</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="4.74">here but if you mean like through</text>
  <text start="527.95" dur="4.83">treason and such I don&amp;#39;t know if they</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="4.26">would air such a thing it may be</text>
  <text start="532.78" dur="4.86">considered bad TV and these you know</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="4.5">more sensible and soft times but once</text>
  <text start="537.64" dur="4.59">upon a time they would have aired a</text>
  <text start="539.38" dur="5.28">major political figure being beheaded or</text>
  <text start="542.23" dur="5.52">something yeah and I do expect that he</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="5.19">will go down for treason he wanted to be</text>
  <text start="547.75" dur="5.88">an American citizen so bad right</text>
  <text start="549.85" dur="5.88">well deal with it I guess that&amp;#39;s the way</text>
  <text start="553.63" dur="3.18">now they&amp;#39;ll probably let him keep it</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="3.89">they&amp;#39;ll probably never call him one</text>
  <text start="556.81" dur="5.76">being you know from a foreign state but</text>
  <text start="559.62" dur="4.63">he will probably go down for treason</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all leading back that way the</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="4.8">trend is heading that way strong and now</text>
  <text start="565.9" dur="5.7">he&amp;#39;s engaging in a satirical I guess</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="5.34">take on the Trump administration through</text>
  <text start="571.6" dur="7.34">Netflix but he went straight into trying</text>
  <text start="574.39" dur="4.55">to play president propaganda didn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="582" dur="6.69">Kate said something about a few stories</text>
  <text start="585.73" dur="5.4">with people taking dog deworming meds</text>
  <text start="588.69" dur="4.3">yes I&amp;#39;ve heard about this story I have</text>
  <text start="591.13" dur="3.69">not confirmed any of that stuff so you</text>
  <text start="592.99" dur="4.8">know I wouldn&amp;#39;t do it myself</text>
  <text start="594.82" dur="4.26">yeah but you know I&amp;#39;m more than anyone</text>
  <text start="597.79" dur="6.96">else open to things that are in the</text>
  <text start="599.08" dur="9.06">alternative David I was talking about</text>
  <text start="604.75" dur="5.1">Obama he&amp;#39;s working with actually both of</text>
  <text start="608.14" dur="4.65">the Obamas are now working with Netflix</text>
  <text start="609.85" dur="6.15">to set out just a constant propaganda to</text>
  <text start="612.79" dur="5.34">send out constant propaganda so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s as though he&amp;#39;s playing president of</text>
  <text start="618.13" dur="5.07">propaganda in a sense because he&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="620.8" dur="4.95">sort of working from DC and he sort of</text>
  <text start="623.2" dur="3.85">alright well he was until maybe recently</text>
  <text start="625.75" dur="3.86">if he&amp;#39;s moving I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="627.05" dur="5.26">multiple houses because he&amp;#39;s so suddenly</text>
  <text start="629.61" dur="4.919">rich from being a public servant and you</text>
  <text start="632.31" dur="4.98">know he&amp;#39;s trying to demonize the Trump</text>
  <text start="634.529" dur="5.071">administration with Netflix propaganda</text>
  <text start="637.29" dur="5.19">and they&amp;#39;re investing billions of</text>
  <text start="639.6" dur="4.02">dollars I mean it was really weird and</text>
  <text start="642.48" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re actually losing a lot of money</text>
  <text start="643.62" dur="3.63">so people were actually kind of confused</text>
  <text start="645.81" dur="3.18">as to why they would do that maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.25" dur="4.98">just an investment strategy but maybe it</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="4.23">was just the deep Seder scared and</text>
  <text start="652.23" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re putting a lot of money into</text>
  <text start="653.22" dur="4.14">things like Netflix and the Obamas</text>
  <text start="655.35" dur="4.859">because they&amp;#39;re trying to win the public</text>
  <text start="657.36" dur="3.93">persuasion game you know it could be</text>
  <text start="660.209" dur="3.12">just that simple</text>
  <text start="661.29" dur="7.65">and they don&amp;#39;t care if they lose a few</text>
  <text start="663.329" dur="7.141">billion I can&amp;#39;t you know Adam says was</text>
  <text start="668.94" dur="5.61">hurricane Tory and a white hat off I</text>
  <text start="670.47" dur="5.58">don&amp;#39;t know we got lucky for sure that</text>

  <text start="1223.779" dur="7.051">about kind of the romance or romantic</text>

  <text start="1240.549" dur="3.96">guess the right-handed path is to serve</text>
  <text start="1243.009" dur="3.75">others the left-handed path is to serve</text>
  <text start="1244.509" dur="3.811">yourself and Disney I guess just seems</text>
  <text start="1246.759" dur="3.39">to be all about creating this</text>
  <text start="1248.32" dur="6.75">unrealistic expectation for children to</text>

  <text start="2359.86" dur="7.45">people newest thing I actually have been</text>
  <text start="2364.19" dur="4.68">shadow banned and censored a lot since</text>
  <text start="2367.31" dur="3.57">before it was a thing I never turned my</text>
  <text start="2368.87" dur="4.26">monetization on for a very long time</text>
  <text start="2370.88" dur="3.6">I assumed that they would just turn it</text>
  <text start="2373.13" dur="4.05">off so I didn&amp;#39;t even turn it on I ever</text>
  <text start="2374.48" dur="4.77">tried for like a year turns out that</text>
  <text start="2377.18" dur="3.42">they did turn it on sometimes and I</text>
  <text start="2379.25" dur="4.29">could have made money in that time I</text>
  <text start="2380.6" dur="4.76">didn&amp;#39;t but I turned it on to increase my</text>
  <text start="2383.54" dur="3.96">rating my rankings</text>
  <text start="2385.36" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s another youtuber told me that</text>
  <text start="2387.5" dur="3.41">you&amp;#39;ll get ranked higher so I wanted</text>
  <text start="2389.36" dur="5.61">more views I want to get the truth out</text>
  <text start="2390.91" dur="6.85">so I turned on the paid ads and then</text>
  <text start="2394.97" dur="5.4">suddenly as soon as you know my channel</text>
  <text start="2397.76" dur="4.83">starts taking off again because you know</text>
  <text start="2400.37" dur="3.54">that that&amp;#39;s what it needed to bypass the</text>
  <text start="2402.59" dur="4.35">algorithm the first time because they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2403.91" dur="5.49">catch me sometimes you know first first</text>
  <text start="2406.94" dur="5.07">11 days 1,200 subscribers and then 50</text>
  <text start="2409.4" dur="4.5">right then 30,000 subscribers one month</text>
  <text start="2412.01" dur="3.39">and then nothing and now I&amp;#39;m losing 400</text>
  <text start="2413.9" dur="5.76">a month for like six months it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2415.4" dur="5.97">ridiculous anyway so I turned it on to</text>
  <text start="2419.66" dur="4.38">get more views but as soon as I did</text>
  <text start="2421.37" dur="4.56">every video as soon as I make it within</text>
  <text start="2424.04" dur="5.76">within the first 500 views I mean first</text>
  <text start="2425.93" dur="5.7">ten minutes it&amp;#39;s demonetized including</text>
  <text start="2429.8" dur="4.83">the one of my daughter&amp;#39;s first steps so</text>
  <text start="2431.63" dur="7.29">like a 17 second video or taking her</text>
  <text start="2434.63" dur="5.63">first steps demonetized automatically it</text>
  <text start="2438.92" dur="5.22">would just proves that there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="2440.26" dur="5.56">hateful about it didn&amp;#39;t say anything you</text>
  <text start="2444.14" dur="4.29">know nothing hateful about it at all and</text>
  <text start="2445.82" dur="5.47">in fact that video is</text>
  <text start="2448.43" dur="6.16">inspired me to launch the stop at</text>

  <text start="2595.309" dur="5.131">chapter and and kind of what went into</text>
  <text start="2597.799" dur="3.99">that from a personal level and why they</text>
  <text start="2600.44" dur="4.26">did it and what their hopes for the book</text>
  <text start="2601.789" dur="5.341">were and I&amp;#39;m gonna release that at some</text>
  <text start="2604.7" dur="5.48">point with a sort of a kindle sale</text>
  <text start="2607.13" dur="6.12">online on Amazon and and just sort of a</text>
  <text start="2610.18" dur="4.51">big thing to get the word out because we</text>
  <text start="2613.25" dur="3.809">were attacked pretty hard about the book</text>
  <text start="2614.69" dur="4.8">so you know when they attack obviously</text>
  <text start="2617.059" dur="4.111">we we fight back and my way of doing</text>
  <text start="2619.49" dur="3.9">that if they attacked us the entire made</text>
  <text start="2621.17" dur="3.389">you know mainstream media attacking the</text>
  <text start="2623.39" dur="3.06">cue book with everything that they could</text>
  <text start="2624.559" dur="4.201">think of from violence to reptile people</text>
  <text start="2626.45" dur="5.339">to whatever you know my response to that</text>
  <text start="2628.76" dur="5.4">was simply to to do a background piece</text>
  <text start="2631.789" dur="5.371">on the authors like why why do we do</text>
  <text start="2634.16" dur="5.1">this you know why did you make this book</text>
  <text start="2637.16" dur="4.47">was it to create problems like why did</text>
  <text start="2639.26" dur="3.809">you want to write about this topic you</text>
  <text start="2641.63" dur="2.939">know what went into this from your</text>
  <text start="2643.069" dur="3.631">personal level what are your hopes for</text>
  <text start="2644.569" dur="5.55">this in the future what did this book</text>
  <text start="2646.7" dur="4.829">mean to you things like that to get the</text>
  <text start="2650.119" dur="3.781">the story behind his since are you gonna</text>
  <text start="2651.529" dur="4.701">just bad Malthus so much and lie about</text>
  <text start="2653.9" dur="2.33">us</text>
  <text start="2662.38" dur="11.91">hmm who is one of saving caffeine when</text>
  <text start="2669.19" dur="8.19">Aunt Nancy says it amazes me that people</text>
  <text start="2674.29" dur="4.65">still don&amp;#39;t get the vaccine issue so you</text>
  <text start="2677.38" dur="4.56">know with respect for whatever position</text>
  <text start="2678.94" dur="5.13">folks have here about that issue my</text>
  <text start="2681.94" dur="3.78">theory on this and I&amp;#39;m not an expert but</text>
  <text start="2684.07" dur="4.92">my theory on this is that some people</text>
  <text start="2685.72" dur="7.17">just they have a hard time accepting</text>
  <text start="2688.99" dur="5.52">human evil like real human evil and they</text>
  <text start="2692.89" dur="3.6">have a hard time accepting in some cases</text>
  <text start="2694.51" dur="4.23">that they were contributory to that evil</text>
  <text start="2696.49" dur="3.9">like like maybe a doctor&amp;#39;s passed out</text>
  <text start="2698.74" dur="3.09">ten thousand of these vaccines already</text>
  <text start="2700.39" dur="3.87">and you&amp;#39;re never gonna convince him that</text>
  <text start="2701.83" dur="5.45">he&amp;#39;s hurt you know to some degree or</text>
  <text start="2704.26" dur="5.52">another ten thousand kids right so</text>
  <text start="2707.28" dur="4.99">there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s an ego thing that</text>
  <text start="2709.78" dur="3.6">blocks that truth to the self because</text>
  <text start="2712.27" dur="2.48">they don&amp;#39;t want to believe it of</text>
  <text start="2713.38" dur="4.47">themselves they don&amp;#39;t want to believe it</text>
  <text start="2714.75" dur="9.3">it&amp;#39;s possible in their world in their</text>
  <text start="2717.85" dur="8.58">life you know people will defend that</text>
  <text start="2724.05" dur="4.18">people will defend that to a very great</text>
  <text start="2726.43" dur="4.47">degree even to the points in some cases</text>
  <text start="2728.23" dur="4.28">of snapping and going crazy and having</text>
  <text start="2730.9" dur="5.97">things like trump derangement syndrome</text>
  <text start="2732.51" dur="7.15">so that&amp;#39;s my best guess as to why they</text>
  <text start="2736.87" dur="4.35">still can&amp;#39;t understand without with all</text>
  <text start="2739.66" dur="3.21">the evidence things like global warming</text>
  <text start="2741.22" dur="5.34">with all the evidence things like you</text>
  <text start="2742.87" dur="5.67">know vaccines it&amp;#39;s not a logic thing</text>
  <text start="2746.56" dur="3.51">anymore for example the famous quote if</text>
  <text start="2748.54" dur="5.61">you could reason with fools there would</text>
  <text start="2750.07" dur="8.91">be no fools all right makes sense</text>
  <text start="2754.15" dur="6.75">best guess anyway um guys I&amp;#39;m probably</text>
  <text start="2758.98" dur="4.56">gonna get off here I have to get up at</text>
