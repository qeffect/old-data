  <text start="277.5" dur="3.199">the room laughing and vines like looked</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="4.92">kind of zeroed in on him a little bit</text>

  <text start="284.28" dur="4.59">britt hume exposing this huge fallacy</text>
  <text start="286.979" dur="4.021">and alexander of inman&amp;#39;s testimony it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.87" dur="4.2">actually right out in public everyone</text>
  <text start="291" dur="5.16">can see it if you know what to look for</text>
  <text start="293.07" dur="4.65">and he says from this article quote he</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="3.12">was deeply troubled by what he</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="4.49">interpreted as an attempt by the</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="4.109">President to subvert u.s. foreign policy</text>
  <text start="302.21" dur="2.8">okay</text>

  <text start="305.01" dur="5.76">in this anyone know what it is well of</text>
  <text start="308.91" dur="3.99">course it&amp;#39;s actually the fact that as</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="4.079">they explained here President Trump</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="4.92">being the president cannot possibly</text>
  <text start="314.849" dur="6.391">subvert u.s. foreign policy he makes it</text>
  <text start="317.82" dur="7.14">period he is the constitutional author</text>

  <text start="324.96" dur="4.489">that President Trump makes our foreign</text>
  <text start="326.789" dur="5.94">policy and that&amp;#39;s it so how could he be</text>
  <text start="329.449" dur="4.75">subverting our foreign policy anyway it</text>
  <text start="332.729" dur="2.761">makes no sense but that&amp;#39;s the kind of</text>
  <text start="334.199" dur="2.851">stuff that they need you to believe in</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="2.73">order to take out our president you&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="820.269" dur="4.591">history and founders month so this is</text>
  <text start="823.209" dur="3.57">gonna piss off the left of course but it</text>
  <text start="824.86" dur="3.57">may even also low-key red pill a lot of</text>
  <text start="826.779" dur="3.331">people about some of those values and</text>

  <text start="830.11" dur="3.419">limited government Republic that kind of</text>
  <text start="832.06" dur="5.01">stuff so hopefully we&amp;#39;ll see more</text>
  <text start="833.529" dur="5.971">education in that area as well and you</text>
  <text start="837.07" dur="4.889">know this is still corruption related</text>
  <text start="839.5" dur="4.38">unfortunately but we have so much going</text>
  <text start="841.959" dur="3.931">on between the Democrat Party and the</text>
  <text start="843.88" dur="4.26">illegal aliens they&amp;#39;re trying to import</text>
  <text start="845.89" dur="4.319">to destroy our culture and also to vote</text>
  <text start="848.14" dur="4.77">for them because no one else will and</text>
  <text start="850.209" dur="4.651">and of course you know it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="852.91" dur="3.419">very different when Brennan Straka from</text>
  <text start="854.86" dur="2.849">walk away because he&amp;#39;s promising to go</text>
  <text start="856.329" dur="3.301">after the Latino vote me seems like</text>
  <text start="857.709" dur="4.591">staging things with IOC now where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="859.63" dur="4.319">going to her office and delivering a</text>
  <text start="862.3" dur="3.81">warning basically saying we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="863.949" dur="3.991">after the Latino vote and you you guys</text>
  <text start="866.11" dur="3.839">have 69 or something percent of it now</text>
  <text start="867.94" dur="3.36">but we&amp;#39;re going to change that so then</text>
  <text start="869.949" dur="3.241">they&amp;#39;re gonna they&amp;#39;re gonna completely</text>
  <text start="871.3" dur="3.779">build that wall and then Democrats are</text>
  <text start="873.19" dur="3.48">gonna completely flip their script at</text>
  <text start="875.079" dur="3.721">that point but until we get to that</text>
  <text start="876.67" dur="5.21">point we actually have illegal aliens</text>
  <text start="878.8" dur="5.88">apparently creating false crimes</text>
  <text start="881.88" dur="5.319">including robbery and like sexual</text>
  <text start="884.68" dur="6.899">molestation if not rape things like that</text>
  <text start="887.199" dur="6.661">at this Bob&amp;#39;s Burgers because why they</text>
  <text start="891.579" dur="5.551">wanted to apparently stay in the country</text>
  <text start="893.86" dur="5.76">this was visa related this was says</text>
  <text start="897.13" dur="4.98">or versus illegal alien related and it</text>
  <text start="899.62" dur="5.13">was a staged crime to manipulate you the</text>
  <text start="902.11" dur="5.46">American people they are learning from</text>
  <text start="904.75" dur="4.68">the Democrats they are watching CNN they</text>
  <text start="907.57" dur="3.39">are watching the left and they know how</text>
  <text start="909.43" dur="3.21">to get away with this stuff because the</text>
  <text start="910.96" dur="4.38">left does this all the time it&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="912.64" dur="4.2">they do you know they bust Senate legal</text>
  <text start="915.34" dur="3.63">voters they&amp;#39;ve been caught undercover</text>
  <text start="916.84" dur="3.75">talking about it it&amp;#39;s repeated over and</text>
  <text start="918.97" dur="3.51">over and over they they plan in many</text>
  <text start="920.59" dur="3.69">cases terrorist attacks like acid</text>
  <text start="922.48" dur="5.01">attacks to deplorable and things of that</text>
  <text start="924.28" dur="5.7">nature so John Solomon memos reveal</text>
  <text start="927.49" dur="4.17">verismo Holdings pressed Obama&amp;#39;s State</text>
  <text start="929.98" dur="3.24">Department to end a helped end</text>
  <text start="931.66" dur="5.31">corruption investigation involving</text>
  <text start="933.22" dur="5.55">hunter Biden so apparently this may go</text>
  <text start="936.97" dur="3.21">back to Obama as well I mean obviously</text>
  <text start="938.77" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s a lot of other corruption as</text>
  <text start="940.18" dur="4.77">well that will eventually be laid at his</text>
  <text start="941.83" dur="6.02">feet this may be one other thing we all</text>
  <text start="944.95" dur="5.76">we also have former US Attorney General</text>
  <text start="947.85" dur="5.44">somewhat whistleblowers not guaranteed</text>
  <text start="950.71" dur="5.88">anonymity he does need to publicly</text>
  <text start="953.29" dur="6.63">testify and be open to cross-examination</text>
  <text start="956.59" dur="6.09">so this is for Eric Caramella</text>
  <text start="959.92" dur="5.28">I think I said that right this time and</text>
  <text start="962.68" dur="5.79">of course this is going to be pretty</text>
  <text start="965.2" dur="4.68">epic in terms of destroying their whole</text>
  <text start="968.47" dur="4.01">narrative once we get some real</text>
  <text start="969.88" dur="5.28">questions in there and it&amp;#39;s not like all</text>
  <text start="972.48" dur="4.18">completely staged hoax fake questions</text>
  <text start="975.16" dur="2.91">that are that are scripted and they</text>
  <text start="976.66" dur="3.45">probably agreed to the answers</text>
  <text start="978.07" dur="3.6">beforehand in a private room because we</text>
  <text start="980.11" dur="3.75">know Schiff is talking to these guys I</text>
  <text start="981.67" dur="5.7">mean he&amp;#39;s basically playing judge jury</text>
  <text start="983.86" dur="5.4">and executioner and also accomplice so</text>
  <text start="987.37" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="989.26" dur="4.95">like your rapist setting you in jail</text>
  <text start="991.78" dur="4.89">because you said something about how he</text>
  <text start="994.21" dur="4.32">raped you this is really bad and it</text>
  <text start="996.67" dur="3.81">cannot stand as long as people are aware</text>
  <text start="998.53" dur="3.21">of this the whole the whole country is</text>
  <text start="1000.48" dur="2.82">turning against it</text>
  <text start="1001.74" dur="3.21">fundraising through the roof I think</text>
  <text start="1003.3" dur="3.54">they got three million dollars just that</text>
  <text start="1004.95" dur="3.96">day to the Trump campaign for</text>
  <text start="1006.84" dur="5.22">re-election just because of impeachment</text>
  <text start="1008.91" dur="5.91">this is a fundraiser for us guys this is</text>
  <text start="1012.06" dur="4.35">this is just headlines for us there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1014.82" dur="3.39">chance that this could possibly happen</text>
  <text start="1016.41" dur="4.05">but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you should be lazy</text>
  <text start="1018.21" dur="5.28">you should go out there and use this as</text>
  <text start="1020.46" dur="5.04">a weapon to politically destroy the left</text>
  <text start="1023.49" dur="4.2">because what they&amp;#39;re doing is peak crazy</text>
  <text start="1025.5" dur="3.21">it&amp;#39;s too far it&amp;#39;s insane they have no</text>
  <text start="1027.69" dur="4.2">argument</text>
  <text start="1028.71" dur="5.4">the emperor has no clothes so continuing</text>
  <text start="1031.89" dur="4.95">on we have general Flint&amp;#39;s lawyers to</text>
  <text start="1034.11" dur="6.39">formally ask judge Sullivan to toss out</text>
  <text start="1036.84" dur="6.81">the entire Flynn case for egregious</text>
  <text start="1040.5" dur="4.62">government misconduct Mel some of the</text>
  <text start="1043.65" dur="3.63">stuff that was coming out of here</text>
  <text start="1045.12" dur="3.57">basically shows that they need to be</text>
  <text start="1047.28" dur="2.81">held in contempt the government needs to</text>
  <text start="1048.69" dur="4.56">be held in contempt there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1050.09" dur="5.02">deleting and hiding the original 302s</text>
  <text start="1053.25" dur="3.81">from flanagan supposedly if they even</text>
  <text start="1055.11" dur="4.47">exist is what they said right so if they</text>
  <text start="1057.06" dur="4.2">still exist or if they exist it would</text>
  <text start="1059.58" dur="3.06">not be somewhat you know it would not be</text>
  <text start="1061.26" dur="3.18">that different from the ones that we</text>
  <text start="1062.64" dur="3.72">have now right because they did edit it</text>
  <text start="1064.44" dur="5.19">because we know lisa page and others</text>
  <text start="1066.36" dur="5.25">edited these documents so there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1069.63" dur="4.08">much more coming out about this but</text>
  <text start="1071.61" dur="4.16">flynn is very much in a strong position</text>
  <text start="1073.71" dur="4.53">he&amp;#39;s very much mal on the aggressive</text>
  <text start="1075.77" dur="4.54">remember a while back when Flynn kind of</text>
  <text start="1078.24" dur="3.75">switched from defense to offense when he</text>
  <text start="1080.31" dur="4.38">hired Sidney powing that really sold</text>
  <text start="1081.99" dur="4.71">attorney well the government turns out</text>
  <text start="1084.69" dur="5.1">and Sidney Powell actually put this in</text>
  <text start="1086.7" dur="4.11">the filing I wish I could it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1089.79" dur="2.91">long so I don&amp;#39;t wanna go through too</text>
  <text start="1090.81" dur="4.23">much of it with you guys but some of the</text>
  <text start="1092.7" dur="5.1">filing basically talked about after he</text>
  <text start="1095.04" dur="4.44">pled guilty or are why he pled guilty</text>
  <text start="1097.8" dur="3.54">was because they threatened town within</text>
  <text start="1099.48" dur="3.54">like a 24 hour period which may have</text>
  <text start="1101.34" dur="3.03">been case related because news was</text>
  <text start="1103.02" dur="4.71">coming out the next day but they</text>
  <text start="1104.37" dur="5.1">threatened him and his son with massive</text>
  <text start="1107.73" dur="4.53">like prison time and all these other</text>
  <text start="1109.47" dur="4.77">things they really leaned hard on him he</text>

  <text start="1282.35" dur="4.05">guilty in this and he does have a point</text>
  <text start="1284.45" dur="3.66">if she worked there and now she&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="1286.4" dur="3.48">to cover it up she was trying to cover</text>
  <text start="1288.11" dur="3.96">it up I mean maybe not then but</text>
  <text start="1289.88" dur="3.96">certainly now and she&amp;#39;s ignoring the</text>
  <text start="1292.07" dur="3.84">arguments and she&amp;#39;s using the</text>
  <text start="1293.84" dur="3.39">emotionalism Steve I&amp;#39;m on the couch here</text>
  <text start="1295.91" dur="3.39">with you are you really gonna accuse me</text>
  <text start="1297.23" dur="4.14">well yes the facts seem to stand out</text>
  <text start="1299.3" dur="3.42">that you were possibly behind it</text>
  <text start="1301.37" dur="2.76">especially since you admit being there</text>
  <text start="1302.72" dur="3.24">and say that there was nothing going on</text>
  <text start="1304.13" dur="3.99">so you&amp;#39;re either covering it up from</text>
  <text start="1305.96" dur="5.4">ignorance or from maliciousness or</text>
  <text start="1308.12" dur="5.79">defensiveness right so absolutely I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1311.36" dur="5.37">with I&amp;#39;m with Steve on this one on the</text>
  <text start="1313.91" dur="4.17">couch it&amp;#39;s funny cuz this show started</text>
  <text start="1316.73" dur="4.62">on a couch for those who remember I</text>
  <text start="1318.08" dur="5.67">flannel shirts dogs everywhere big couch</text>
  <text start="1321.35" dur="5.61">like dog hair all over it</text>
  <text start="1323.75" dur="6.09">beard gosh why did you guys stick around</text>
  <text start="1326.96" dur="4.71">right I&amp;#39;m a more professional looking</text>
  <text start="1329.84" dur="3.81">now although I still and I&amp;#39;m working on</text>
  <text start="1331.67" dur="3.72">the beard again I guess it&amp;#39;s been a busy</text>
  <text start="1333.65" dur="3.39">week though there&amp;#39;s so much happening</text>
  <text start="1335.39" dur="3.63">and now O&amp;#39;Keefe I was gonna shave but</text>
  <text start="1337.04" dur="4.5">O&amp;#39;Keefe&amp;#39;s thing comes out at 20 minutes</text>
  <text start="1339.02" dur="4.77">ago I&amp;#39;ve got to get on that breaking</text>
  <text start="1341.54" dur="5.16">Yale and Moody&amp;#39;s oh this is for the</text>
  <text start="1343.79" dur="4.5">economic stuff so kind of ending the</text>
  <text start="1346.7" dur="3.51">point really because we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1348.29" dur="4.95">gonna also jump into the economic video</text>
  <text start="1350.21" dur="5.85">but this is a good segue actually</text>
  <text start="1353.24" dur="4.32">because Yale Moody&amp;#39;s and Oxford economic</text>
  <text start="1356.06" dur="3.78">pols is a little bit different because</text>
  <text start="1357.56" dur="4.8">in the investment news world it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1359.84" dur="4.25">little bit more objective it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="1362.36" dur="3.45">bit more fact-based and honest and</text>
  <text start="1364.09" dur="3.58">business people are usually too busy</text>
  <text start="1365.81" dur="3.81">trying to actually do their businesses</text>
  <text start="1367.67" dur="2.7">to try to worry about propaganda and</text>
  <text start="1369.62" dur="3.18">that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="1370.37" dur="5.45">so you usually get a little bit better</text>
  <text start="1372.8" dur="5.16">perspective from the business angle but</text>
  <text start="1375.82" dur="4.75">you know all the other</text>
  <text start="1377.96" dur="6.299">polls are complete BS so this particular</text>
  <text start="1380.57" dur="6.599">series of polls shows President Trump</text>
  <text start="1384.259" dur="6.061">winning 2020 even if a recession happens</text>
  <text start="1387.169" dur="4.83">I would say especially if a recession</text>
  <text start="1390.32" dur="3.209">happens because people know he&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="1391.999" dur="4.02">with business he&amp;#39;s good with the economy</text>
  <text start="1393.529" dur="5.13">and if it happens they&amp;#39;re gonna know it</text>
  <text start="1396.019" dur="5.13">was the feds fault it was the feds fault</text>
