  <text start="8.16" dur="6.269">cover 36 49 and it&amp;#39;s a pretty simple one</text>
  <text start="12.719" dur="3.511">you guys may have even seen if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="14.429" dur="3.811">Twitter this account the Trump train</text>
  <text start="16.23" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s been around for a while and puts</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="4.32">out a lot of great memes and as I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="20.91" dur="3.48">covered in the past even people in the</text>
  <text start="22.56" dur="3.719">military write about how effective memes</text>
  <text start="24.39" dur="5.07">are in modern warfare information</text>
  <text start="26.279" dur="4.681">warfare so you know some people I feel</text>
  <text start="29.46" dur="3.869">like maybe kind of roll their eyes when</text>
  <text start="30.96" dur="4.5">you say the word mean but once you</text>
  <text start="33.329" dur="5.101">really understand the power of a meme</text>
  <text start="35.46" dur="5.58">and how it can transcend language and it</text>
  <text start="38.43" dur="5.34">can even bypass the algorithms that are</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="5.07">being used to set to shut down freedom</text>
  <text start="43.77" dur="4.23">of speech on the Internet and especially</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="4.74">through big tech companies like Facebook</text>
  <text start="48" dur="7.17">and Google and YouTube and the rest and</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="6.33">Twitter of course memes are powerful and</text>
  <text start="55.17" dur="4.5">really they&amp;#39;re an extension of art and</text>
  <text start="57.18" dur="4.859">art has always been powerful in and of</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="6.17">itself for the same reasons it has a way</text>
  <text start="62.039" dur="6.301">of speaking to people in a very quick</text>
  <text start="65.84" dur="6.029">just a split second and it can sum up</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="7.41">really complex ideas by simply having a</text>
  <text start="71.869" dur="4.231">picture or an image or or something like</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="4.11">that</text>
  <text start="76.1" dur="6.07">now memes can come on in many forms but</text>
  <text start="79.86" dur="6.48">one of my favorite through the last year</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="8.28">was this one and this this meme or or as</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="6.69">its represented in this picture here the</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="3.93">bad guys behind bars you know this this</text>
  <text start="93.03" dur="3.87">picture has had a couple of different</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="4.71">forms and in fact I don&amp;#39;t think I see</text>
  <text start="96.9" dur="3.96">the one here with Brennan when when he</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="3.75">was added to it so this is the older</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="3.539">version there&amp;#39;s one where Brennan&amp;#39;s face</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="5.04">is added right up here in your clapper I</text>
  <text start="104.399" dur="4.65">think and Bill and he belongs there and</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="3.15">of course there&amp;#39;s quite a few of the</text>
  <text start="109.049" dur="5.811">others there that belong a page and the</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="7.32">rest but that&amp;#39;s pretty much what this</text>
