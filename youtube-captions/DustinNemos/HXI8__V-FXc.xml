  <text start="44.64" dur="3.239">don&amp;#39;t want to make this too long but we</text>
  <text start="46.62" dur="4.79">are going to be talking about the</text>
  <text start="47.879" dur="7.531">ongoing FISA investigation as well as</text>
  <text start="51.41" dur="6.91">Mexico is now finally cracking down on</text>
  <text start="55.41" dur="5.94">people assisting those large caravans</text>

  <text start="69.9" dur="7.109">abortions that worthy hide agreement all</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="5.16">right so let&amp;#39;s get into this this first</text>
  <text start="77.009" dur="4.741">one is from the Washington Examiner</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="4.8">this is former FBI lawyer James Baker</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="6.54">cooperating with DOJ Inspector General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="6">FISA abuse investigation the Justice</text>

  <text start="90.18" dur="5.13">supervised abuse might not be winding</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="4.949">down yet former top FBI lawyer James</text>
  <text start="95.31" dur="3.599">Baker said this week he is cooperating</text>
  <text start="97.439" dur="2.881">with the Justice Department inspector</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="4.011">general&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="4.38">quote I have had a long-standing</text>
  <text start="102.92" dur="3.309">relationship with the inspector</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="3.27">general&amp;#39;s office because they firmly</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="3.811">believe in the appropriateness and the</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="7.77">need for effective oversight of the FBI</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="7.89">end quote Baker said Baker&amp;#39;s omission is</text>
  <text start="115.74" dur="3.9">another sign that despite wit Attorney</text>
  <text start="117.93" dur="2.009">General William Barr said earlier this</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="2.22">year</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="3.96">Inspector General Michael Horowitz</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="4.439">investigation may not be completed by</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="4.681">early June a focus of this investigation</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="4.651">is the FBI&amp;#39;s use of an unverified</text>
  <text start="128.58" dur="5.239">dossier on president Trump&amp;#39;s ties to</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="5.06">Russia written by Christopher steel tip</text>
  <text start="133.819" dur="4.161">warrants to surveil one time Trump</text>
  <text start="136.01" dur="4.589">campaign official Carter page</text>
  <text start="137.98" dur="4.929">although Sean Hannity had said this week</text>
  <text start="140.599" dur="4.86">that sources were telling him bar may</text>
  <text start="142.909" dur="4.83">have already had may already have a copy</text>
  <text start="145.459" dur="4.471">of the inspector general&amp;#39;s report on the</text>
  <text start="147.739" dur="4.411">fires a piece investigation a British</text>
  <text start="149.93" dur="4.559">newspaper reported Horowitz may soon be</text>
  <text start="152.15" dur="6.53">interviewing steel casting into further</text>
  <text start="154.489" dur="6.45">uncertainty at the status of inquiry so</text>
  <text start="158.68" dur="5.559">thing I don&amp;#39;t want to say about that is</text>
  <text start="160.939" dur="5.431">that we don&amp;#39;t exactly know when this is</text>
  <text start="164.239" dur="5.731">coming out so they gave us an</text>
  <text start="166.37" dur="6.089">approximate date from May to June of</text>
  <text start="169.97" dur="5.129">when this was going to be coming out but</text>
  <text start="172.459" dur="5.521">we don&amp;#39;t really know we can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="175.099" dur="4.651">pinpoint an exact date especially when</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="5.189">it comes to an investigation of this</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="8.129">size now I will say also that this</text>
  <text start="183.169" dur="6.99">investigation is one of many so there</text>
  <text start="187.879" dur="6.091">are several and I believe it&amp;#39;s at least</text>
  <text start="190.159" dur="6.48">ten that are related to the findings</text>
  <text start="193.97" dur="5.189">from the Moller report okay and as we</text>
  <text start="196.639" dur="5.13">know that has nothing to do with anyone</text>
  <text start="199.159" dur="5.58">on the on the Trump side at all</text>
  <text start="201.769" dur="6.03">so those investigations are going to be</text>
  <text start="204.739" dur="4.92">conducted on the other side so we have</text>
  <text start="207.799" dur="7.53">all of those investigations happening at</text>
  <text start="209.659" dur="7.17">the same time so it&amp;#39;s possible there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="215.329" dur="4.861">couple things that are possible here one</text>
  <text start="216.829" dur="5.55">is that the FISA is not done yet the</text>
  <text start="220.19" dur="3.96">FISA investigation is not done and they</text>
  <text start="222.379" dur="3.991">still have some work that needs be you</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="4.799">know completed which one surprised me</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="5.67">because it&amp;#39;s such a large investigation</text>
  <text start="228.949" dur="5.341">and they need to have everything really</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="4.08">airtight so they have to cross all their</text>
  <text start="234.29" dur="3.809">T&amp;#39;s and dot all their eyes and they</text>
  <text start="236.12" dur="3.899">can&amp;#39;t miss anything so they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="238.099" dur="4.051">very meticulous about it you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="240.019" dur="4.68">hasten something like this because if</text>
  <text start="242.15" dur="5.399">you do then these people will get away</text>
  <text start="244.699" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s how that happens the other thing</text>
  <text start="247.549" dur="7.11">is is that is it very possible also that</text>
  <text start="250.459" dur="7.59">James Baker is cooperating in relation</text>
  <text start="254.659" dur="4.92">to other investigations not just this</text>
  <text start="258.049" dur="4.561">one because everybody&amp;#39;s focusing on this</text>
  <text start="259.579" dur="6.251">one FISA abuse investigation but this is</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="6.73">not the only thing that came out of this</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="6.39">so we have to keep that in mind thing</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="5.22">Ron mmm it says Baker took a lead role</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="4.199">in reviewing those PI&amp;#39;s applications</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="3.72">before submitting them to the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="276.419" dur="4.47">he has said he took the information</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="4.53">seriously but not necessarily literally</text>
  <text start="280.889" dur="3.78">and also that he is nervous about</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="4.77">Horowitz which he should be they should</text>
  <text start="284.669" dur="5.671">all be nervous actually I&amp;#39;ll be very</text>
  <text start="287.58" dur="5.1">nervous because you know at this point</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="6.229">they know they are guilty and they know</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="6.419">that they are going down at some point</text>
  <text start="296.569" dur="4.181">all right the next one here is from the</text>
  <text start="299.099" dur="4.53">Gateway Punnett says John Solomon</text>
  <text start="300.75" dur="5.129">bombshell key figure that molar report</text>
  <text start="303.629" dur="6.72">link to Russia was actually a State</text>
  <text start="305.879" dur="7.141">Department Intel source ammos report</text>
  <text start="310.349" dur="4.711">Ukrainian businessman Konstantin kill</text>
  <text start="313.02" dur="4.889">Manik the so-called Russian who Paul</text>
  <text start="315.06" dur="6.69">Manafort shared internal polling data</text>
  <text start="317.909" dur="7.26">with isn&amp;#39;t a Russian he&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="5.34">quote sensitive intelligence source for</text>
  <text start="325.169" dur="4.53">the US State Department who informed on</text>
  <text start="327.09" dur="5.4">Ukrainian and Russian matters reported</text>
  <text start="329.699" dur="4.951">Solomon Solomon had reviewed a hundreds</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="4.89">of pages of government documents proving</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="4.799">that Kayla Manning is indeed a State</text>
  <text start="337.38" dur="4.08">Department Intel source and even worse</text>
  <text start="339.449" dur="3.12">Muller possessed these documents since</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="2.94">2018</text>
  <text start="342.569" dur="4.951">which that actually isn&amp;#39;t a surprise I</text>
  <text start="344.4" dur="5.81">mean two years of a hoax investigation</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="4.86">he knew that this whole thing was a sham</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="7.389">so now it&amp;#39;s still a little bit unclear</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="7.89">as to which side he was on he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.599" dur="5.401">definitely not a good guy but whether or</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="5.16">not he was conducting the hoax</text>
  <text start="363" dur="4.77">investigation over two years and you</text>
  <text start="365.43" dur="4.169">know really dragging it out on behalf of</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="3.75">the thief state or whether or not he was</text>
  <text start="369.599" dur="4.79">doing that as a distraction to the deep</text>
  <text start="371.52" dur="5.28">state on behalf of President Trump</text>
  <text start="374.389" dur="6.071">because of course president Trump and</text>
  <text start="376.8" dur="5.339">everyone they have dirt on Muller so you</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="4.29">know then Muller would then become</text>
  <text start="382.139" dur="6.75">controlled opposition and of course you</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="9.12">know this whole Russian hoax has been</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="8.01">the focus for over two years so this</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="4.27">would be a very good distraction tactic</text>
  <text start="396.899" dur="4.091">actually so</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="5.01">is still unclear why he was dragging out</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="4.34">but it doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me that he did</text>
  <text start="403.15" dur="5.1">have this information for this long</text>
  <text start="405.33" dur="4.93">so John Solomon had said quote the</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="3.69">incomplete portrayal of kill Manik is so</text>
  <text start="410.26" dur="3.75">important to Mulder&amp;#39;s overall narrative</text>
  <text start="411.94" dur="4.62">that it is raised in the opening of his</text>
  <text start="414.01" dur="4.53">report the FBI assesses kill Manik to</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="4.47">have ties to Russian intelligence</text>
  <text start="418.54" dur="4.59">Muller&amp;#39;s team wrote on page six putting</text>
  <text start="421.03" dur="4.17">a sinister light on every contact can</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="4.77">when a CAD with manna for the former</text>
  <text start="425.2" dur="4.83">Trump campaign chairman what a dozen</text>
  <text start="427.9" dur="4.47">state is that kill Manik was a sensitive</text>
  <text start="430.03" dur="5.19">intelligence source for state going back</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="4.77">to at least 2013 while he was still</text>
  <text start="435.22" dur="4.53">working for mana Fork according to FBI</text>
  <text start="437.14" dur="4.41">and State Department memos kill Manik</text>
  <text start="439.75" dur="3.54">was not just any run-of-the-mill source</text>
  <text start="441.55" dur="4.11">either he interacted with a chief</text>
  <text start="443.29" dur="4.68">political officer at the US Embassy in</text>
  <text start="445.66" dur="4.26">Kiev sometimes many several times a week</text>
  <text start="447.97" dur="4.02">to provide information to the Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="449.92" dur="4.23">government he relayed messages back to</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="4.56">Ukraine&amp;#39;s leaders and delivered written</text>
  <text start="454.15" dur="4.71">reports to US officials via emails that</text>
  <text start="456.55" dur="5.49">stretched on thousands of words the men</text>
  <text start="458.86" dur="4.95">must show the FBI knew all of this well</text>
  <text start="462.04" dur="4.77">before the mole investigation concluded</text>
  <text start="463.81" dur="6.84">Alan Perl the chief political officer at</text>
  <text start="466.81" dur="5.46">the Kipp embassy from 2014 to 2017 told</text>
  <text start="470.65" dur="3.3">FBI agents that state officials</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="3.93">including senior embassy officials</text>
  <text start="473.95" dur="4.47">Alexandre Casanova and Eric Schultz</text>
  <text start="476.2" dur="4.17">deemed commenting to be such a valuable</text>
  <text start="478.42" dur="3.84">asset that they kept his name out of</text>
  <text start="480.37" dur="4.86">cables for fear he would be compromised</text>
  <text start="482.26" dur="5.91">by leaks to WikiLeaks so really what it</text>
  <text start="485.23" dur="4.74">boils down to is that this guy was</text>
  <text start="488.17" dur="5.13">portrayed as something more sinister</text>
  <text start="489.97" dur="5.25">than he actually was so they were making</text>
  <text start="493.3" dur="5.16">him seem like he was some kind of</text>
  <text start="495.22" dur="5.46">Russian agent or Russian sympathizer</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="3.6">when actually he&amp;#39;d been working for the</text>
  <text start="500.68" dur="4.32">State Department for many years so they</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="4.29">obviously knew about that and you know</text>
  <text start="505" dur="5.61">so they can&amp;#39;t pretend that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="506.35" dur="6.15">and that was his job his job was to know</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="3.93">what was going on with Russia and</text>
  <text start="512.5" dur="3.96">Ukraine and to interact with those</text>
  <text start="514.54" dur="5.64">people on a regular basis that was his</text>
  <text start="516.46" dur="5.73">job but they assumed that the rest of us</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="3.78">aren&amp;#39;t going to know about that so they</text>
  <text start="522.19" dur="3.54">can just write whatever they want about</text>
  <text start="523.96" dur="2.49">this guy and we&amp;#39;re just going to take it</text>
  <text start="525.73" dur="5.56">at face value</text>
  <text start="526.45" dur="9.16">well now we&amp;#39;re digging more into that</text>
  <text start="531.29" dur="6.21">so that is being exposed every almost</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="4.589">everything in this molar report was</text>
  <text start="537.5" dur="5.31">designed to be misleading in a way that</text>
  <text start="540.199" dur="4.111">would satisfy more or less the Democrats</text>
  <text start="542.81" dur="3.75">because they want to continue this</text>
  <text start="544.31" dur="4.5">narrative okay</text>
  <text start="546.56" dur="5.79">so the next one here really briefly</text>
  <text start="548.81" dur="5.25">there is a second senator former</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="4.14">Republican state senator who was found</text>
  <text start="554.06" dur="5.87">dead at his home with a gunshot wounds</text>
  <text start="556.49" dur="9.209">now we know that not even two days ago</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="8.5">another former state senator Linda</text>
  <text start="565.699" dur="6.601">Collins was actually found dead in her</text>
  <text start="568.43" dur="6.329">home as a result of a gunshot wound</text>
  <text start="572.3" dur="4.709">we don&amp;#39;t have further details on that of</text>
  <text start="574.759" dur="6.63">course because they immediately put a</text>
  <text start="577.009" dur="9.241">gag order on that entire case so at this</text>
  <text start="581.389" dur="7.111">point the details are very few but we do</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="5.1">know that as far as Linda Collins is</text>
  <text start="588.5" dur="6.99">concerned she was looking into different</text>
  <text start="591.35" dur="6.39">things such as the missing funds that</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="4.89">had to do with the Department of Child</text>
  <text start="597.74" dur="5.339">Services it was about twenty million</text>
  <text start="600.38" dur="4.949">dollars that was missing they also found</text>
  <text start="603.079" dur="3.901">that there were two books that existed</text>
  <text start="605.329" dur="8.421">that were separate so that&amp;#39;s hugely</text>
  <text start="606.98" dur="12.96">shady also she was really active in</text>
  <text start="613.75" dur="10.72">fighting child trafficking and she had</text>
  <text start="619.94" dur="7.829">done a lot of work towards reducing</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="8.4">child trafficking and investigating that</text>
  <text start="627.769" dur="7.411">and also she was supposed to apparently</text>
  <text start="632.87" dur="4.199">allegedly I have to confirm this</text>
  <text start="635.18" dur="6.389">somewhere but allegedly she was supposed</text>
  <text start="637.069" dur="8.221">to testify in a grand jury concerning</text>
  <text start="641.569" dur="8.851">the Whitewater scandal later this week</text>
  <text start="645.29" dur="7.859">so that&amp;#39;s kind of a big deal so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.42" dur="5.909">that and now we have this guy who was</text>
  <text start="653.149" dur="6.961">found dead and apparently also there are</text>
  <text start="656.329" dur="5.88">two NYPD officers who also apparently</text>
  <text start="660.11" dur="4.04">allegedly committed suicide this is all</text>
  <text start="662.209" dur="4.851">within two days of each other so</text>
  <text start="664.15" dur="6.33">this is a big deal this is not something</text>
  <text start="667.06" dur="5.58">that is coincidental something fishy is</text>

  <text start="798.06" dur="6.209">right now and they at this point they</text>
  <text start="801.449" dur="6">know that Trump is serious and so they</text>
  <text start="804.269" dur="6.24">are now going to take measures in order</text>
  <text start="807.449" dur="6.06">to remedy that because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="810.509" dur="4.68">to feel this financial squeeze anymore</text>
  <text start="813.509" dur="4.411">they&amp;#39;re not going to be able to</text>
  <text start="815.189" dur="6.061">withstand it for too much longer so they</text>
  <text start="817.92" dur="5.7">have to do with they&amp;#39;re supposed to do</text>
  <text start="821.25" dur="3.81">which is make sure that these people</text>
  <text start="823.62" dur="3.209">don&amp;#39;t get into the country</text>
  <text start="825.06" dur="4.23">now I don&amp;#39;t really understand why</text>
  <text start="826.829" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;ve continued to allow this anyway</text>
  <text start="829.29" dur="4.469">because at this point long ago they</text>
  <text start="832.199" dur="3.39">should have known that President Trump</text>
  <text start="833.759" dur="4.14">was very serious about you know</text>
  <text start="835.589" dur="4.021">protecting the US border and not</text>
  <text start="837.899" dur="3.571">allowing these illegals to just flood</text>
  <text start="839.61" dur="4.26">into the country so then what happens</text>
  <text start="841.47" dur="5.82">all of these people that they allowed to</text>
  <text start="843.87" dur="5.55">cross their southern border to come all</text>
  <text start="847.29" dur="4.62">the way up the country now those people</text>
  <text start="849.42" dur="4.649">are going to be stuck in Mexico so now</text>
  <text start="851.91" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;ve just adopted all of those people</text>
  <text start="854.069" dur="3.301">that they just allowed coming in their</text>
  <text start="855.72" dur="3.15">country because they thought that those</text>
  <text start="857.37" dur="3.769">people were gonna be able to make it</text>
  <text start="858.87" dur="5.759">into the US because it&amp;#39;s worked before</text>
  <text start="861.139" dur="6.7">well guess what those days are over and</text>
  <text start="864.629" dur="5.551">those days have been over a long time so</text>
  <text start="867.839" dur="6.151">almost as soon as Trump took office</text>
  <text start="870.18" dur="4.92">those days were over so at this point</text>
  <text start="873.99" dur="2.399">they should learn that they should</text>
  <text start="875.1" dur="3.179">really just protect their southern</text>
  <text start="876.389" dur="5.971">border and not allow them to come in</text>
  <text start="878.279" dur="8.61">period at all and then you know everyone</text>
  <text start="882.36" dur="8.55">will be happy at that point alright this</text>
  <text start="886.889" dur="6.81">next one finally finally president Trump</text>
  <text start="890.91" dur="5.609">saw signs the long-delayed 19 point 1</text>
  <text start="893.699" dur="3.901">billion disaster aid bill this is huge</text>
  <text start="896.519" dur="3.06">because this is something they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="897.6" dur="3.179">fighting over for quite some time</text>
  <text start="899.579" dur="4.2">because the Democrats have been</text>
  <text start="900.779" dur="5.881">resisting this aid bill the last time I</text>
  <text start="903.779" dur="3.451">reported on this they had everything</text>
  <text start="906.66" dur="4.049">ready</text>
  <text start="907.23" dur="7.649">but the Democrats refused because they</text>
  <text start="910.709" dur="4.8">wanted more for Puerto Rico right but</text>
  <text start="914.879" dur="4.26">here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="915.509" dur="6.781">Puerto Rico we have given them over 90</text>
  <text start="919.139" dur="7.05">billion dollars in aid and on top of</text>
  <text start="922.29" dur="5.33">that in the original bill that you know</text>
  <text start="926.189" dur="6.161">they refused there</text>
  <text start="927.62" dur="8.28">an additional six hundred million in</text>
  <text start="932.35" dur="5.739">food assistance so it wasn&amp;#39;t like we</text>
  <text start="935.9" dur="3.57">weren&amp;#39;t giving Puerto Rico anything at</text>
  <text start="938.089" dur="3.601">all we were we were giving them</text>
  <text start="939.47" dur="4.08">something in and on top of the money</text>
  <text start="941.69" dur="5.73">that we had already given them that was</text>
  <text start="943.55" dur="5.76">actually misused by leaders in Puerto</text>
  <text start="947.42" dur="3.3">Rico so it had nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="949.31" dur="4.44">President Trump president Trump has been</text>
  <text start="950.72" dur="5.18">supporting them for so long and they</text>
  <text start="953.75" dur="4.82">should be thankful just like he has said</text>
  <text start="955.9" dur="7.27">okay so this one&amp;#39;s from the epoch times</text>
  <text start="958.57" dur="6.76">it says President Donald Trump has</text>
  <text start="963.17" dur="4.2">signed a 19 point 1 billion dollar</text>
  <text start="965.33" dur="3.75">disaster aid bill aimed at helping</text>
  <text start="967.37" dur="3.63">communities across the country bounce</text>
  <text start="969.08" dur="4.44">back from hurricanes floods tornadoes</text>
  <text start="971" dur="4.32">and fires he tweeted a photo of himself</text>
  <text start="973.52" dur="5.25">holding the sign Phil and what appeared</text>
  <text start="975.32" dur="5.34">to be his office aboard Air Force One it</text>
  <text start="978.77" dur="3.72">came shortly after Trump landed in</text>
  <text start="980.66" dur="5.73">Ireland following a ceremony in France</text>
  <text start="982.49" dur="7.41">commemorating d-day invasion so this is</text>
  <text start="986.39" dur="5.88">a big big deal actually we needed this</text>
  <text start="989.9" dur="4.89">so much because there are so many areas</text>
  <text start="992.27" dur="5.64">just like President Trump is saying in</text>
  <text start="994.79" dur="7.169">this tweet is so many states Georgia</text>
  <text start="997.91" dur="5.929">Florida Iowa Nevada and North Carolina</text>
  <text start="1001.959" dur="4.891">California all these places have had</text>
  <text start="1003.839" dur="5.261">major natural disasters over the past</text>
  <text start="1006.85" dur="4.04">couple of years even few years and you</text>
  <text start="1009.1" dur="4.5">know a lot of these places really</text>
  <text start="1010.89" dur="4.84">haven&amp;#39;t even been put back together yet</text>
  <text start="1013.6" dur="6.87">because they just don&amp;#39;t have the funds</text>
  <text start="1015.73" dur="9.479">and so this disaster aid relief is</text>
  <text start="1020.47" dur="7.02">something that is very needed and has</text>
  <text start="1025.209" dur="4.35">been either for a long time and the fact</text>
  <text start="1027.49" dur="5.28">that the Democrats were holding you know</text>
  <text start="1029.559" dur="5.25">it hostage over you know the fact that</text>
  <text start="1032.77" dur="5.58">they wanted aid more aid to go to Puerto</text>
  <text start="1034.809" dur="6.39">Rico and I think a little bit of it had</text>
  <text start="1038.35" dur="5.609">to do with also they don&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="1041.199" dur="4.86">President Donald Trump or whenever so</text>
  <text start="1043.959" dur="4.35">they will they&amp;#39;re the types that they</text>
  <text start="1046.059" dur="5.641">want to cut off their nose to spite</text>
  <text start="1048.309" dur="4.921">their face so they&amp;#39;re willing to let</text>
  <text start="1051.7" dur="3.86">everybody else suffer just so they can</text>
  <text start="1053.23" dur="5.16">resist Trump that&amp;#39;s a little idea behind</text>
  <text start="1055.56" dur="4.87">this resistance group or hashtag</text>
  <text start="1058.39" dur="5.94">resistance or whatever</text>
  <text start="1060.43" dur="4.62">which is hugely detrimental to this</text>
  <text start="1064.33" dur="2.49">nation</text>
  <text start="1065.05" dur="4.29">so everything that they&amp;#39;ve been doing so</text>
  <text start="1066.82" dur="5.61">far you know as far as pushing for</text>
  <text start="1069.34" dur="4.89">impeachment and you know really pushing</text>
  <text start="1072.43" dur="5.16">for open borders and resisting Trump at</text>
  <text start="1074.23" dur="5.07">every turn and really just even anytime</text>
  <text start="1077.59" dur="3.54">they come out and make a press</text>
  <text start="1079.3" dur="4.29">conference where they talk badly about</text>
  <text start="1081.13" dur="4.92">this president that could be time that</text>
  <text start="1083.59" dur="3.75">they spent doing something else doing</text>
  <text start="1086.05" dur="4.2">something more productive for this</text>
  <text start="1087.34" dur="5.22">country but they just refused to so this</text>
  <text start="1090.25" dur="5.51">is a huge win and it&amp;#39;s you know been a</text>
  <text start="1092.56" dur="6.59">long time coming we need this so badly</text>
  <text start="1095.76" dur="6.22">all right so the next one here Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="1099.15" dur="4.84">this one is from the epic time sister</text>
  <text start="1101.98" dur="3.54">Biden reverses stances he no longer</text>
  <text start="1103.99" dur="4.89">supports ban on federal funds for</text>
  <text start="1105.52" dur="5.4">abortions u.s. Democratic presidential</text>

  <text start="1120.04" dur="4.89">had confirmed he was in favor of just a</text>
  <text start="1121.96" dur="6.33">day before the Hyde Amendment was passed</text>
  <text start="1124.93" dur="5.55">in 1976 more than two years after the</text>

  <text start="1130.48" dur="4.2">use of federal funds to pay for abortion</text>

  <text start="1136.81" dur="4.65">a threat to the woman&amp;#39;s life on late</text>
  <text start="1139.24" dur="4.35">June 6 Biden told a crowd at a</text>
  <text start="1141.46" dur="4.08">Democratic Party fundraiser in Atlanta</text>
  <text start="1143.59" dur="3.03">that he had changed his mind it would no</text>
  <text start="1145.54" dur="3.12">longer support the Hyde Amendment</text>
  <text start="1146.62" dur="4.56">because of recent abortion bans and</text>

  <text start="1157.03" dur="2.9">end quote</text>
  <text start="1159.96" dur="5.38">ok so this is a case of where you know</text>
  <text start="1163.12" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re flip-flopping so he had</text>
  <text start="1165.34" dur="6.6">previously supported this but because</text>
  <text start="1167.98" dur="6.95">his unpopular with his Democratic system</text>
  <text start="1171.94" dur="5.22">since he&amp;#39;s going to change positions and</text>
  <text start="1174.93" dur="4.75">this is the difference between people</text>
  <text start="1177.16" dur="5.63">like Joe Biden and people like President</text>
  <text start="1179.68" dur="5.85">Trump because if you&amp;#39;ve actually watched</text>

  <text start="1480.389" dur="4.38">then that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re calling on this</text>

  <text start="1747.789" dur="3.99">maybe there&amp;#39;s a bias against</text>

  <text start="1784.149" dur="4.35">for free speech is so important right</text>
  <text start="1786.759" dur="5.431">now because here&amp;#39;s the thing when it</text>
  <text start="1788.499" dur="6.78">comes to free speech free speech is not</text>
  <text start="1792.19" dur="6.3">about the freedom of speech about ideas</text>
  <text start="1795.279" dur="5.13">that you agree with it&amp;#39;s about the</text>
  <text start="1798.49" dur="4.379">freedom of speech period the freedom to</text>
  <text start="1800.409" dur="5.311">be able to express your own ideas you</text>

  <text start="1807.639" dur="5.341">say whatever you want because in some</text>
  <text start="1810.58" dur="4.26">countries if you say you don&amp;#39;t like that</text>
  <text start="1812.98" dur="3.809">leader you cannot even say that because</text>
  <text start="1814.84" dur="3.059">they will throw you in jail and you will</text>

  <text start="1817.899" dur="4.5">but here it&amp;#39;s supposed to be so free</text>
  <text start="1820.119" dur="4.44">where you can think anything you want</text>
  <text start="1822.399" dur="4.201">you can say anything you want you can</text>
  <text start="1824.559" dur="3.81">have whatever opinion you want but</text>
  <text start="1826.6" dur="4.409">nowadays it&amp;#39;s getting to the point where</text>
  <text start="1828.369" dur="4.68">you know your opinion is only free if</text>
  <text start="1831.009" dur="6.681">it&amp;#39;s the opinion that they want you to</text>
  <text start="1833.049" dur="8.211">have which is a very 1984 Orwellian idea</text>
  <text start="1837.69" dur="6.33">so we have to take a stand you know</text>
  <text start="1841.26" dur="5.43">against things like this so and we</text>
  <text start="1844.02" dur="3.99">should even stand for ideas that are</text>
  <text start="1846.69" dur="2.76">getting banned or censored</text>
  <text start="1848.01" dur="3.57">even if it&amp;#39;s something that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1849.45" dur="7.02">agree with so like let&amp;#39;s say for example</text>
  <text start="1851.58" dur="7.38">if a liberal idea is being censored then</text>
  <text start="1856.47" dur="4.23">I should stand up for the expression of</text>

  <text start="1864.48" dur="5.01">a free idea because we all should be</text>
  <text start="1866.82" dur="3.84">able to have that because that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1869.49" dur="4.92">this country is about</text>
  <text start="1870.66" dur="7.74">so right now we are trying to build a</text>

  <text start="1878.4" dur="4.2">that is going to benefit all of us</text>
  <text start="1880.77" dur="4.65">so we should all take a part in</text>
  <text start="1882.6" dur="4.2">supporting that if you haven&amp;#39;t already</text>
  <text start="1885.42" dur="5.04">look for the Free Speech Movement</text>
  <text start="1886.8" dur="6.15">Twitter page it&amp;#39;s at freedom speech</text>
  <text start="1890.46" dur="6.15">movement one so do look for that follow</text>
