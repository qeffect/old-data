  <text start="31.369" dur="3.931">before we begin we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="32.93" dur="4.769">some very interesting research with the</text>
  <text start="35.3" dur="3.75">topical applications of c60 but I have</text>
  <text start="37.699" dur="3.481">to go through a couple disclaimers of</text>
  <text start="39.05" dur="4.56">course this is not medical or health</text>
  <text start="41.18" dur="4.229">advice or claims this is for research</text>
  <text start="43.61" dur="5.01">purposes only this is not approved by</text>
  <text start="45.409" dur="4.531">the FDA I don&amp;#39;t make any sort of claims</text>
  <text start="48.62" dur="3.149">or suggestions I have to be upfront</text>
  <text start="49.94" dur="3.899">about that of course because you know</text>
  <text start="51.769" dur="4.921">how the system works so let&amp;#39;s begin</text>
  <text start="53.839" dur="4.89">let&amp;#39;s dive in now a quick overview and</text>
  <text start="56.69" dur="4.14">you will find the source in the bottom</text>
  <text start="58.729" dur="4.201">right of the slide but a quick overview</text>
  <text start="60.83" dur="4.59">of some of the topical benefits this is</text>
  <text start="62.93" dur="5.03">on your skin external use associated</text>
  <text start="65.42" dur="5.159">with c60 according to the research and</text>
  <text start="67.96" dur="4.6">of course I encourage you to look into</text>
  <text start="70.579" dur="3.451">the research looking to the studies okay</text>
  <text start="72.56" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s so much more work to be</text>
  <text start="74.03" dur="5.28">done here but what we&amp;#39;ve seen so far is</text>
  <text start="76.46" dur="5.729">incredibly promising in my opinion so</text>
  <text start="79.31" dur="5.01">let&amp;#39;s run down a quick list anti-aging</text>
  <text start="82.189" dur="4.191">anti-wrinkle moisturizing a pore</text>
  <text start="84.32" dur="4.259">tightening scalp and hair growth</text>
  <text start="86.38" dur="3.94">whitening specifically there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.579" dur="3.631">interesting studies around melanin</text>
  <text start="90.32" dur="3.6">control which could lend itself to</text>
  <text start="92.21" dur="4.28">fighting certain forms of skin cancer</text>
  <text start="93.92" dur="5.69">like melanomas which are very deadly</text>
  <text start="96.49" dur="5.88">anti-acne properties antiviral capacity</text>
  <text start="99.61" dur="5.95">anti-inflammatory activity antimicrobial</text>
  <text start="102.37" dur="6.85">potential ultra potent antioxidant this</text>
  <text start="105.56" dur="7.38">world&amp;#39;s strongest antioxidant incredibly</text>
  <text start="109.22" dur="6.27">safe now let&amp;#39;s explore some of those</text>
  <text start="112.94" dur="5.28">anti-wrinkle research and effects that</text>
  <text start="115.49" dur="5.4">are being alleged so in a clinical</text>
  <text start="118.22" dur="4.77">evaluation of florene c6 d dissolve in</text>
  <text start="120.89" dur="5.339">squalene for anti-wrinkle cosmetics we</text>
  <text start="122.99" dur="5.85">have the method highly purified and</text>
  <text start="126.229" dur="4.5">organic solvent free this is important</text>
  <text start="128.84" dur="5.369">because many people out there they put</text>
  <text start="130.729" dur="6.21">the solvent Laden c60 that has not yet</text>
  <text start="134.209" dur="5.191">been vacuumed oven-baked to clean it off</text>
  <text start="136.939" dur="3.871">in their wheels or they take it to try</text>
  <text start="139.4" dur="3.6">to save money because it&amp;#39;s about half</text>
  <text start="140.81" dur="2.67">the price and you don&amp;#39;t want to skip</text>
  <text start="143" dur="2.159">that step</text>
  <text start="143.48" dur="5.16">those those solvents could potentially</text>
  <text start="145.159" dur="5.311">be toxic so they took the c64 means it</text>
  <text start="148.64" dur="4.349">was dissolved at a nearly saturated</text>
  <text start="150.47" dur="6.719">concentration of 278 parts per million</text>
  <text start="152.989" dur="5.971">in scaling prepared from olive oil 23</text>
  <text start="157.189" dur="3.541">Japanese women average age of 30</text>
  <text start="158.96" dur="5.13">eight point nine so right at 39 years</text>
  <text start="160.73" dur="6.96">old eight week trial randomized matched</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="6.36">pair double-blind study c60 was applied</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="5.52">twice daily on half of the face and non</text>
  <text start="170.45" dur="4.14">c60 oil on the other half now here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.21" dur="3.77">where it gets really interesting in</text>
  <text start="174.59" dur="6.09">terms of you know beauty or age-related</text>
  <text start="176.98" dur="6.22">applications the results of this cream</text>
  <text start="180.68" dur="4.83">with C 60 in it on the half of the face</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="3.93">that they applied it to turned out to be</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="4.38">significantly more effective than the</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="5.37">placebo oil at the 8th week and without</text>
  <text start="189.89" dur="5.46">any severe side effects so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="4.77">suggesting that this cream could be used</text>
  <text start="195.35" dur="6.78">as an active ingredient for wrinkle care</text>
  <text start="197.27" dur="7.17">cosmetics so what about acne research so</text>

  <text start="204.44" dur="4.43">vulgaris by topical fullerene</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="5.61">application unique impact on skin care</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="5.29">this is the study the method used</text>

  <text start="214.16" dur="5.01">gel in treating acne vulgaris they</text>
  <text start="217.07" dur="4.53">performed an open trial using a</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="5.73">fullerene gel twice a day at four and</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="5.64">eight weeks the results the number of</text>
  <text start="224.9" dur="4.89">pustules consisting of accumulation of</text>
  <text start="227.24" dur="6.05">neutrophils was significantly decreased</text>
  <text start="229.79" dur="5.58">the reduction rate of nearly 88%</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="3.76">suggesting that fullerene suppresses</text>
  <text start="235.37" dur="4.98">acne through decreasing neutrophil</text>
  <text start="237.05" dur="5.21">infiltration and sebum production so</text>
  <text start="240.35" dur="6">fullerene gel may help in controlling</text>
  <text start="242.26" dur="6.55">acne now let&amp;#39;s talk about hair growth</text>

  <text start="251.45" dur="5.58">2% radical sponge and the tonic that</text>
  <text start="254" dur="5.19">does not contain it were applied twice a</text>
  <text start="257.03" dur="4.32">day every morning and evening to the</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="4.8">specified part of the head before the</text>
  <text start="261.35" dur="5.07">application three months after the start</text>
  <text start="263.99" dur="4.44">of the application and six months after</text>
  <text start="266.42" dur="3.84">the start of the application the hair</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="4.53">growth rate and hair diameter hair</text>
  <text start="270.26" dur="5.01">density and anagen hair percentage of</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="5.49">the specified part were measured with</text>
  <text start="275.27" dur="5.16">photography the results regarding hair</text>
  <text start="278.45" dur="3.93">diameter hair density and the anagen</text>
  <text start="280.43" dur="3.66">hair percentage no change was observed</text>
  <text start="282.38" dur="4.17">when the tonic formulated with radical</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="4.23">sponge was applied for six months but it</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="5.22">became clear that hair growth rate</text>
  <text start="288.32" dur="4.279">became 16% faster by as early as after</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="3.199">six months</text>
  <text start="292.599" dur="4.141">from the result it was confirmed that</text>
  <text start="294.969" dur="5.01">fullerene could increase hair growth</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="4.739">rate this was believed to be caused by</text>
  <text start="299.979" dur="6.39">protecting the cells around the hair</text>
  <text start="301.479" dur="7.291">follicle from the active oxygen so</text>
