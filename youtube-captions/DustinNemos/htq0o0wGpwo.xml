  <text start="20.09" dur="3.05">from our Patriot sponsors</text>
  <text start="25.33" dur="4.77">there was a time when I had my head in</text>
  <text start="27.52" dur="5.25">the sand then I found out that powered</text>
  <text start="30.1" dur="5.58">platters passed lies for truth and truth</text>
  <text start="32.77" dur="5.55">for lies especially in areas of life and</text>
  <text start="35.68" dur="5.79">hell I used to stay quiet and now I</text>
  <text start="38.32" dur="5.879">speak up a red pill my family a red pill</text>

  <text start="55.12" dur="7.74">pill living calm wake up stand up speak</text>
  <text start="59.44" dur="6.27">up so everyone knows about ms-13 and the</text>
  <text start="62.86" dur="4.74">threat that they provide to everyday</text>
  <text start="65.71" dur="3.81">American citizens by being here</text>
  <text start="67.6" dur="3.99">mostly illegally in our country a</text>
  <text start="69.52" dur="4.5">violent gang known for raping children</text>
  <text start="71.59" dur="5.49">and other things violent murders things</text>
  <text start="74.02" dur="5.16">like that now New York authorities are</text>
  <text start="77.08" dur="4.77">charging 96 that&amp;#39;s almost a hundred</text>
  <text start="79.18" dur="4.74">ms-13 gang members and associates in the</text>
  <text start="81.85" dur="4.559">largest takedown in New York State</text>
  <text start="83.92" dur="4.769">history there they are declaring the</text>
  <text start="86.409" dur="3.421">gang inoperable whatever that means I</text>
  <text start="88.689" dur="3.901">think they&amp;#39;ve kind of gutted the</text>
  <text start="89.83" dur="4.47">leadership of the Long Island ms-13 or</text>
  <text start="92.59" dur="4.11">something like that but it&amp;#39;s just one</text>
  <text start="94.3" dur="4.2">small batch but this is a great step up</text>
  <text start="96.7" dur="4.46">in the right direction getting these</text>
  <text start="98.5" dur="4.98">violent people off of the streets and</text>
  <text start="101.16" dur="5.11">putting them to death if their child</text>
  <text start="103.48" dur="4.23">raping murderers for you know the new</text>
  <text start="106.27" dur="5.7">federal death penalty wouldn&amp;#39;t be a bad</text>
  <text start="107.71" dur="6.54">idea as Trump said fast</text>
  <text start="111.97" dur="4.2">what is it fast trials and quick</text>
  <text start="114.25" dur="3">executions or something like that and we</text>
  <text start="116.17" dur="3.54">got to do something about all these</text>
  <text start="117.25" dur="4.86">people hurting kids I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="119.71" dur="3.9">exact tweet but basically we have to do</text>
  <text start="122.11" dur="4.58">something about hurting these people</text>
  <text start="123.61" dur="5.28">hurting all these children fast trials</text>
  <text start="126.69" dur="4.42">followed by death penalty I think that</text>
  <text start="128.89" dur="4.739">was it almost word-for-word I want off</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="5.489">memory here so we also have Meadows a</text>
  <text start="133.629" dur="5.61">parent successor revealed as a never</text>
  <text start="136.599" dur="4.95">Trumper so Meadows is apparently</text>
  <text start="139.239" dur="3.661">retiring from his job he&amp;#39;s gonna go into</text>
  <text start="141.549" dur="5.491">some other thing to help President Trump</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="7.369">I think however the woman that is being</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="6.21">suggested to replace him Linda Bennett</text>
  <text start="150.269" dur="6.791">is the vice chair of Haywood County</text>

  <text start="161.239" dur="6.211">quoted as saying I am a never Trump</text>
  <text start="163.189" dur="6.33">person I don&amp;#39;t want Trump and you know</text>
  <text start="167.45" dur="4.2">she basically goes through some other</text>

  <text start="193.34" dur="3.269">yeah and that&amp;#39;s where it cut off so she</text>
  <text start="194.81" dur="4.14">really does not like president Trump</text>

  <text start="198.95" dur="3.869">word never Trump in here</text>
  <text start="200.359" dur="5.341">like five or six times in this tax which</text>
  <text start="202.819" dur="5.971">is a direct quote so this from a leaked</text>
  <text start="205.7" dur="5.489">audio I think it was now John Durham is</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="4.289">investigating former CIA director John</text>
  <text start="211.189" dur="4.05">Brennan I&amp;#39;ve already brought this up</text>
  <text start="213.079" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s coming out now that he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="5.37">investigated including his roles are his</text>
  <text start="218.299" dur="5.611">lies to Congress and his role in the</text>
  <text start="220.609" dur="5.431">interference in 2016 so this is getting</text>
  <text start="223.91" dur="4.469">very interesting Brennan himself has</text>
  <text start="226.04" dur="4.949">been a loud smoke and loud spoken</text>
  <text start="228.379" dur="4.32">smartass on Twitter for years now</text>
  <text start="230.989" dur="4.231">against President Trump so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="232.699" dur="5.37">good to see him finally hopefully shut</text>
  <text start="235.22" dur="4.379">up as he better lawyer up now now we</text>
  <text start="238.069" dur="3.931">also have a FISA judge</text>
  <text start="239.599" dur="4.53">rosemary Collier to step down and resign</text>
  <text start="242" dur="4.019">or at least to step down from her</text>
  <text start="244.129" dur="3.811">position as the head FISA Court I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="246.019" dur="4.411">think she&amp;#39;s gonna step down completely</text>
  <text start="247.94" dur="4.019">until a couple of months later when her</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="3.36">term ends but she will be</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="4.111">apparently replaced by an Obama</text>
  <text start="253.79" dur="5.64">appointed judge to the head of the FISA</text>
  <text start="256.07" dur="6.18">Court is not gonna be any better if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.43" dur="4.47">Judge James Bobo&amp;#39;s Berg or Boas Berg</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s my little one out there playing</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="4.5">you can hear her making noises</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="4.56">so prosecutors tell judge that the</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="3.84">missing surveillance footage outside of</text>
  <text start="270.53" dur="6.6">Epstein&amp;#39;s prison cell on night of</text>
  <text start="272.24" dur="7.709">suicide attempt has been found this is</text>
  <text start="277.13" dur="5.159">going to be a very interesting change in</text>
  <text start="279.949" dur="4.561">the chapter also by the way for those</text>
  <text start="282.289" dur="4.051">who are interested John McAfee is</text>
  <text start="284.51" dur="5.909">blowing up Twitter saying that it was</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="5.44">actually the murder murdering cop I</text>
  <text start="290.419" dur="3.761">think he was charged for murdering</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="4.71">or people in Lincoln gangland-style but</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="4.77">the cop officer I think was Andrew</text>
  <text start="296.49" dur="4.17">Tartaglia Oni I think his name was at</text>
  <text start="298.95" dur="2.7">least heart Taglioni I think is the last</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="3.63">name because that one was a bit more</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="5.63">memorable he the guy who was supposedly</text>
  <text start="304.29" dur="8.34">taken out of the cell with Epstein is</text>
  <text start="307.28" dur="6.88">going to death row he&amp;#39;s up for being put</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="4.8">to the death penalty and maybe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.16" dur="6.27">trying to avoid that and maybe if maybe</text>
  <text start="317.43" dur="5.19">if he had been the one who had</text>
  <text start="320.43" dur="3.6">supposedly helped Epstein the first time</text>
  <text start="322.62" dur="3.2">he tried to commit himself that might</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="4.23">look good right but um</text>
  <text start="325.82" dur="4.3">according to McAfee he was never taken</text>
  <text start="328.26" dur="3.78">out of the cell he was left in there to</text>
  <text start="330.12" dur="5.04">murder Epstein and he&amp;#39;s the perfect</text>
  <text start="332.04" dur="5.85">cover because he&amp;#39;s got nothing to lose</text>
  <text start="335.16" dur="5.16">and he&amp;#39;s already a murderer so maybe he</text>
  <text start="337.89" dur="4.62">was offered a deal we won&amp;#39;t put you to</text>
  <text start="340.32" dur="3.69">death or maybe he was just offered some</text>
  <text start="342.51" dur="4.26">money or something who knows what right</text>
  <text start="344.01" dur="4.86">because you&amp;#39;re already pretty far down</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="3.149">the pole there you can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="2.58">much I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna get him</text>
  <text start="349.919" dur="4.291">out of jail maybe they&amp;#39;ll get him off</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="4.23">the death penalty so there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="354.21" dur="3.48">things that you could offer to someone</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="4.26">in that position to get them to do</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="4.2">another murder of the guy that&amp;#39;s like 5</text>
  <text start="359.94" dur="3.99">feet away what are they gonna do to you</text>
  <text start="361.89" dur="5.79">lock you up again put you in a different</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="6.45">room that&amp;#39;s it right so we also have</text>
  <text start="367.68" dur="5.34">Latvia flagging a suspicious payment to</text>
  <text start="370.38" dur="5.52">hunter Biden and then urged Ukraine to</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="5.07">investigate so we&amp;#39;re getting more and</text>
  <text start="375.9" dur="3.99">more information about hunter and the</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="4.47">Biden&amp;#39;s and the others involved in the</text>
  <text start="379.89" dur="4.83">coup d&amp;#39;etat and also the sell out of our</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="5.01">government to foreign governments now</text>
  <text start="384.72" dur="4.29">this and then you know using our</text>
  <text start="387.57" dur="2.94">government our money our taxpayer money</text>
  <text start="389.01" dur="3.029">to enrich themselves not even just</text>
  <text start="390.51" dur="4.8">selling us out to foreign governments</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="4.981">but just doing it badly you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="3.359">so much money they&amp;#39;ve taken in looted</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="4.59">from us it&amp;#39;s all they wanted to do was</text>
  <text start="398.669" dur="4.921">loot us so this is just another link and</text>
  <text start="401.61" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s also links to China coming out</text>
  <text start="403.59" dur="4.59">from Biden&amp;#39;s as well they I think paid</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="5.57">him billions of dollars we&amp;#39;ll get to</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="7.47">that another video not on this one</text>
  <text start="412.31" dur="5.229">anyway so we also have Andrew McCabe was</text>
  <text start="415.65" dur="3.75">a forced to admit on live television</text>
  <text start="417.539" dur="3.87">this week that there were serious</text>
  <text start="419.4" dur="4.35">mistakes and the Feiss application</text>
  <text start="421.409" dur="4.901">process under his watch</text>
  <text start="423.75" dur="4.78">now Durham&amp;#39;s probe will blow the lid off</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="4.02">the deep states of FISA abuse and</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="6.169">corruption I want to show you guys this</text>
  <text start="430.33" dur="4.369">let me pause it and mute myself</text>
  <text start="434.82" dur="5.55">really secretive by Sakura issuing a</text>
  <text start="437.82" dur="4.08">rare public order slamming the bureau</text>
  <text start="440.37" dur="3.68">for mistakes made in seeking</text>
  <text start="441.9" dur="5.22">surveillance warrants during the Russia</text>
  <text start="444.05" dur="5.38">investigation very serious misconduct on</text>
  <text start="447.12" dur="3.75">your watch very serious very serious the</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="3.54">processor is that these FISA</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="3.93">applications and renewals first come up</text>
  <text start="452.97" dur="3.87">through the FBI chain of command they</text>
  <text start="454.8" dur="3.84">are sworn under oath by a career federal</text>
  <text start="456.84" dur="3.21">agent Jim Comey he says it was</text>
  <text start="458.64" dur="3.99">sloppiness but this wasn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="5.1">sloppiness these were brutal mistakes</text>
  <text start="462.63" dur="4.41">they were very very serious mistakes</text>
  <text start="465.15" dur="4.38">they come into basically two different</text>
  <text start="467.04" dur="4.23">categories things that they told the</text>
  <text start="469.53" dur="3.93">court which were not consistent with</text>
  <text start="471.27" dur="3.84">what we knew in our own files and facts</text>
  <text start="473.46" dur="3.51">that we left out I think that we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="3.51">major bombshells coming in the durham</text>
  <text start="476.97" dur="3.66">investigation okay Daren I think the</text>
  <text start="478.62" dur="3.36">president understands that that is</text>
  <text start="480.63" dur="4.34">really what the American people want to</text>
  <text start="481.98" dur="2.99">see in terms of accountability</text>
  <text start="486.35" dur="4.09">accountability that is going to be a</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="5.67">word you hear a lot more of in the next</text>
  <text start="490.44" dur="6.63">couple of weeks so we also by the way</text>
  <text start="493.95" dur="5.97">have a FISA Court releasing previously</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="4.29">classified order expanding investigation</text>
  <text start="499.92" dur="4.23">to include all the warrants brought</text>
  <text start="501.36" dur="6.27">before the court by FBI attorney Kevin</text>
  <text start="504.15" dur="6.45">Kline Smith so everything he did is now</text>
  <text start="507.63" dur="5.969">going to be looked at because he is a</text>
  <text start="510.6" dur="6.03">very crooked very dirty person</text>
  <text start="513.599" dur="7.051">FBI attorney number two who said things</text>
  <text start="516.63" dur="6.45">like I am numb I can&amp;#39;t stop crying that</text>
  <text start="520.65" dur="4.05">makes me even more sad probably in</text>
  <text start="523.08" dur="4.14">relation to President Trump I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="6.12">remember what that one was about so yeah</text>
  <text start="527.22" dur="5.1">this is yet again another expansion of</text>
  <text start="530.82" dur="2.79">the investigation I don&amp;#39;t know how far</text>
  <text start="532.32" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to go here before</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="2.94">people start saying Hugh was right all</text>
  <text start="535.95" dur="5.15">along</text>
  <text start="536.55" dur="8.13">this stuff was known years ago even so</text>

  <text start="556.95" dur="5.69">jail for a week for contempt of court</text>
  <text start="559.59" dur="6.45">for refusing to get her son vaccinated</text>
  <text start="562.64" dur="5.05">this sets a precedent potentially where</text>

  <text start="606.21" dur="4.32">happening with vaccines so it looks like</text>
  <text start="608.25" dur="3.42">it was already crashing on the chart and</text>
  <text start="610.53" dur="2.55">then it spiked because of the</text>
  <text start="611.67" dur="3.3">introduction of the vaccine and then it</text>
  <text start="613.08" dur="3.84">continues on down now I&amp;#39;ve debated</text>
  <text start="614.97" dur="4.71">vaccines for a very long time almost</text>
  <text start="616.92" dur="4.53">half of my life now and I</text>
  <text start="619.68" dur="3.09">very familiar with the many reasons that</text>
  <text start="621.45" dur="3.449">you do not want to put it in your body</text>
  <text start="622.77" dur="4.29">can&amp;#39;t find a single one to put it in</text>
  <text start="624.899" dur="4.981">because they don&amp;#39;t have any long-term</text>
  <text start="627.06" dur="5.16">safety studies my friend dr. Andrew</text>
  <text start="629.88" dur="4.11">Wakefield who you guys may remember is</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="4.41">the one who kind of broke open the big</text>
  <text start="633.99" dur="4.14">link between autism and and vaccines and</text>
  <text start="636.63" dur="4.62">all he really said was we should look</text>
  <text start="638.13" dur="5.459">into this more well he also put out a</text>
  <text start="641.25" dur="4.38">very depressing case for what vaccines</text>
  <text start="643.589" dur="5.491">can do to you and I encourage you to</text>
  <text start="645.63" dur="6.09">look at his autism one documentary but</text>
  <text start="649.08" dur="5.129">his speech from autism one on Saturday</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="4.59">morning at the last autism one I was</text>
  <text start="654.209" dur="6.391">there in the audience and it was it was</text>
  <text start="656.31" dur="8.76">a must hear speech I mean I&amp;#39;m telling</text>
  <text start="660.6" dur="7.08">you virgin soil population and that&amp;#39;s us</text>
  <text start="665.07" dur="4.44">and that means that kind of like when</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="3.779">whites first met Indians and a lot of</text>
  <text start="669.51" dur="3.78">Indians got really sick from a lot of</text>
  <text start="671.459" dur="3.721">the animals that and and diseases that</text>
  <text start="673.29" dur="5.03">we had they had not yet met or</text>
  <text start="675.18" dur="4.98">domesticated or or built immunities to</text>
  <text start="678.32" dur="3.97">that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="680.16" dur="4.17">that was a virgin soil population right</text>
  <text start="682.29" dur="4.89">so we are now a virgin soil population</text>
  <text start="684.33" dur="4.41">for you guessed it some of the exact</text>
  <text start="687.18" dur="3.54">same diseases that the vaccines</text>
  <text start="688.74" dur="4.71">supposedly got rid of but instead</text>
  <text start="690.72" dur="4.559">mutated and made into super versions now</text>
  <text start="693.45" dur="4.55">things like measles will become deadly</text>
  <text start="695.279" dur="6.841">again far worse than ever before and</text>
  <text start="698" dur="6.43">things like bacteria also superbugs are</text>
  <text start="702.12" dur="5.25">mutating and now antibiotics are failing</text>
  <text start="704.43" dur="4.44">at greater rates than ever folks that</text>
  <text start="707.37" dur="3.93">means that unless we come up with</text>
  <text start="708.87" dur="3.87">something else quickly or people start</text>
  <text start="711.3" dur="3.15">learning about independent health very</text>
  <text start="712.74" dur="4.2">quickly a third of the world could die</text>
  <text start="714.45" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m not joking about that antibiotics</text>
  <text start="716.94" dur="3.03">are a big deal</text>
  <text start="717.93" dur="4.56">I mean people died of just random</text>
  <text start="719.97" dur="6.15">typical things this all the time from</text>
  <text start="722.49" dur="5.61">cuts or scrapes on and on so you know</text>
  <text start="726.12" dur="5.13">without antibiotics that work we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="728.1" dur="5.22">sitting prey to a lot of different nasty</text>
  <text start="731.25" dur="3.81">bugs out there same thing with the</text>
  <text start="733.32" dur="4.68">viruses although I&amp;#39;m not particularly</text>
  <text start="735.06" dur="5.13">concerned about these things myself not</text>
  <text start="738" dur="3.39">directly because I have a strong immune</text>
  <text start="740.19" dur="3">system I have a pretty good</text>
  <text start="741.39" dur="4.29">understanding of holistic SIU&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="743.19" dur="5.16">herbs I take great supplements like</text>
  <text start="745.68" dur="5.25">carbon shield 60 and and liposomal</text>
  <text start="748.35" dur="3.9">vitamins which are incredibly potent and</text>
  <text start="750.93" dur="2.36">effective I get them from red pill</text>
  <text start="752.25" dur="3.11">living calm</text>
  <text start="753.29" dur="4.77">you want to support the show but these</text>
  <text start="755.36" dur="4.56">kind of things are very effective in my</text>
  <text start="758.06" dur="2.85">opinion in my view for myself you know</text>
  <text start="759.92" dur="4.71">these are the things that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="5.28">using for my entire life ever since I</text>
  <text start="764.63" dur="3.18">started learning about vitamin C and how</text>
  <text start="766.19" dur="3">it was probably a little bit better for</text>
  <text start="767.81" dur="3.959">you than the drugs they&amp;#39;re giving you</text>
  <text start="769.19" dur="4.29">right I didn&amp;#39;t want the aspirin it makes</text>
  <text start="771.769" dur="3.87">your brain bleed I didn&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="773.48" dur="4.109">tylenol or the Advil or any of that</text>
  <text start="775.639" dur="3.75">stuff these things are all liver toxic</text>
  <text start="777.589" dur="5.18">and I&amp;#39;ll have terrible side effects</text>
  <text start="779.389" dur="6.031">I wanted the herb whose side effect was</text>
  <text start="782.769" dur="5.26">not really maybe taste bad right like</text>
  <text start="785.42" dur="5.01">unless you&amp;#39;re really abusing some of</text>
  <text start="788.029" dur="4.86">these natural plants it&amp;#39;s a lot harder</text>
  <text start="790.43" dur="4.17">to destroy your health over a long</text>
  <text start="792.889" dur="2.971">period of time now not impossible some</text>
  <text start="794.6" dur="3.419">plants are very dangerous you should</text>
  <text start="795.86" dur="3.719">always do your research and check with</text>
  <text start="798.019" dur="3.87">your medical provider for advice and</text>
  <text start="799.579" dur="3.87">everything but if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="801.889" dur="3.901">treating yourself at home you have a</text>
  <text start="803.449" dur="4.051">kind of a holistic medical cabinet at</text>
  <text start="805.79" dur="4.14">home like people used to do by the way</text>
  <text start="807.5" dur="4.319">before hospitals and and allopathic</text>
  <text start="809.93" dur="3.57">medicine anyway every village had</text>
  <text start="811.819" dur="4.08">somebody that knew about plants knew</text>
  <text start="813.5" dur="4.529">about herbs if you had a child with a</text>
  <text start="815.899" dur="4.231">fever that made I mean maybe fever for</text>
  <text start="818.029" dur="4.321">you would save them or it maybe if you</text>
  <text start="820.13" dur="4.56">had a infection maybe that particular or</text>
  <text start="822.35" dur="4.71">this particular herb would help plants</text>
  <text start="824.69" dur="4.92">are very powerful natural medicines and</text>
  <text start="827.06" dur="4.68">holistic are very important to and I</text>
  <text start="829.61" dur="4.789">think that that form of medicine that</text>
  <text start="831.74" dur="6.089">holistic rather than allopathic it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="834.399" dur="6.401">homeopathic allopathic being cut poison</text>
  <text start="837.829" dur="5.211">burn surgery doctors vaccines that what</text>
  <text start="840.8" dur="5.219">you typically think of as a hospital</text>
  <text start="843.04" dur="4.81">homeopathic being instead of cut poison</text>
  <text start="846.019" dur="3.901">burn let&amp;#39;s build your body up let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.85" dur="4.049">build your immune system up and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="849.92" dur="4.71">solve your problems with your body&amp;#39;s own</text>
  <text start="851.899" dur="5.911">mechanisms by giving your body the tools</text>
  <text start="854.63" dur="5.79">and the fuel that it needs which almost</text>
  <text start="857.81" dur="4.98">no one does correctly because they</text>
  <text start="860.42" dur="4.71">basically destroy the education around</text>
  <text start="862.79" dur="5.609">this area and even the food pyramid will</text>
  <text start="865.13" dur="4.769">make you sick so the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="868.399" dur="3.571">designed to make you sick unless you</text>
  <text start="869.899" dur="3.961">start to wake up to holistic and then</text>
  <text start="871.97" dur="4.049">you don&amp;#39;t have to worry as much about</text>
  <text start="873.86" dur="5.07">the diseases you don&amp;#39;t have to certainly</text>
  <text start="876.019" dur="5.19">worry as much about the bacterias and</text>
  <text start="878.93" dur="3.81">such because you&amp;#39;re stronger than most</text>
  <text start="881.209" dur="3.81">of those around you at that point you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="882.74" dur="3.33">going to be the last man standing or the</text>
  <text start="885.019" dur="3.211">last woman stand</text>
  <text start="886.07" dur="5.31">unless you have an immune compromised</text>
  <text start="888.23" dur="5.31">situation so you know I don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="891.38" dur="3.6">too long about the vaccine issue I just</text>
  <text start="893.54" dur="3.9">wanted to give people a little bit of</text>
  <text start="894.98" dur="4.95">context about vaccines this is</text>
  <text start="897.44" dur="4.079">definitely not inclusive there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="899.93" dur="3.899">more to it than I couldn&amp;#39;t cover it in</text>
  <text start="901.519" dur="4.651">ten videos and I have tried in the past</text>
  <text start="903.829" dur="3.601">and you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of places out</text>
  <text start="906.17" dur="4.349">there that you can get more information</text>
  <text start="907.43" dur="4.55">see the VAX documentary see some of the</text>
  <text start="910.519" dur="4.861">videos put out by some of the</text>
  <text start="911.98" dur="4.96">anti-vaxxers like Adele big tree or dr.</text>
  <text start="915.38" dur="4.439">Andrew Wakefield I think he&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="916.94" dur="5.43">with another documentary now and by the</text>
  <text start="919.819" dur="4.5">way he has spoken to President Trump</text>
  <text start="922.37" dur="4.079">behind the scenes I think he was invited</text>
  <text start="924.319" dur="4.051">to the White House and he believes a</text>
  <text start="926.449" dur="3.75">President Trump does know about anti</text>
  <text start="928.37" dur="3.6">vaccines and the arguments and he does</text>
  <text start="930.199" dur="4.08">believe that President Trump wants to do</text>
  <text start="931.97" dur="4.38">something about vaccines now you guys</text>
  <text start="934.279" dur="4.23">have already seen President Trump is no</text>
  <text start="936.35" dur="5.039">ally to the big pharma establishment</text>
  <text start="938.509" dur="4.711">types he&amp;#39;s cutting their profit margins</text>
  <text start="941.389" dur="4.231">he&amp;#39;s cutting their drug costs look at</text>
  <text start="943.22" dur="4.919">how he made a deal where we can buy our</text>
  <text start="945.62" dur="4.589">drugs from Canada now for a lot less so</text>
  <text start="948.139" dur="4.14">we are getting some major inroads into</text>
  <text start="950.209" dur="3.661">Big Pharma&amp;#39;s power base these are not</text>
  <text start="952.279" dur="3.12">things that they&amp;#39;d want to happen but</text>
  <text start="953.87" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re happening because of President</text>
  <text start="955.399" dur="5.49">Trump I have hope for the vaccine issue</text>
  <text start="957.86" dur="6.39">however if things like this continue to</text>
  <text start="960.889" dur="7.081">happen I fear for the future of the</text>
  <text start="964.25" dur="6.199">planet how many how can the world carry</text>
  <text start="967.97" dur="6.21">on if we had 100 percent vaccine damage</text>
  <text start="970.449" dur="5.32">you know these children are maimed not</text>
  <text start="974.18" dur="3.779">only for life but for their children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="975.769" dur="4.44">lives it it&amp;#39;s multi-generational</text>

  <text start="988.25" dur="6.779">it&amp;#39;s multiple generations of damage done</text>
  <text start="991.04" dur="6.12">and especially to the brains of these</text>
  <text start="995.029" dur="4.86">developing babies that are too small to</text>
  <text start="997.16" dur="5.25">handle being hit with multiple vaccines</text>
  <text start="999.889" dur="4.741">at once you&amp;#39;re starting to see autism</text>
  <text start="1002.41" dur="4.25">like one in 50 something one in 40</text>
  <text start="1004.63" dur="4.379">something now used to be one in hundreds</text>
  <text start="1006.66" dur="4.539">used to be unheard of you&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="1009.009" dur="4.411">see cancer everyone knows somebody who</text>
  <text start="1011.199" dur="4.26">asked cancer I&amp;#39;ve lost a grandfather to</text>
  <text start="1013.42" dur="4.649">cancer and now I&amp;#39;m working on a</text>
