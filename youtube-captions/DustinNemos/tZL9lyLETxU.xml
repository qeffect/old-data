  <text start="180.93" dur="4.47">stuff fascinating stuff although I</text>
  <text start="183.42" dur="6.15">wouldn&amp;#39;t take anything by Lee Stranahan</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="5.76">to be serious at all anyway if you guys</text>
  <text start="189.57" dur="3.57">remember I debated him for like four or</text>
  <text start="191.16" dur="5.28">five hours straight on the Q topic and</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="7.41">all he did was defend Evie&amp;#39;s crib defend</text>
  <text start="196.44" dur="6.15">Podesta and and just sort of moved the</text>
  <text start="200.55" dur="5.82">goalposts and changed topics a lot he</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="5.82">was really avoiding the q topic and and</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="4.2">then of course afterwards the next day</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="4.29">he challenged me to a one cue proof per</text>
  <text start="210.57" dur="4.23">day debate on Twitter and what happened</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="4.32">he blocked me and never showed up and</text>
  <text start="214.8" dur="4.2">started lying about me and just it was</text>
  <text start="217.02" dur="3.57">weird and that&amp;#39;s kind of stuff that</text>
  <text start="219" dur="5.1">happens all the time and then since then</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="6">I&amp;#39;ve noticed that old least Ranahan has</text>
  <text start="224.1" dur="6.45">called into the Alex Jones Show to bash</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="5.79">Q actually I saw that happen he was a</text>
  <text start="230.55" dur="4.29">call-in we know his voice very</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="4.92">recognizable he was a call in during the</text>
  <text start="234.84" dur="4.35">I think it was a June third interview</text>
  <text start="237.3" dur="3.57">with Alex Jones where he was</text>
  <text start="239.19" dur="4.019">interviewing captain Roy the co-author</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="3.99">of the qa9 book and and we know that Lee</text>
  <text start="243.209" dur="4.831">Stranahan has it out for Q but anyway</text>
  <text start="244.86" dur="6.659">the point here is that Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="248.04" dur="6.06">worked with Ukrainian government at the</text>
  <text start="251.519" dur="5.731">time to take down Trump all right this</text>
  <text start="254.1" dur="4.47">is a this is a big deal this is a major</text>
  <text start="257.25" dur="4.08">deal because we already have Hillary</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="4.11">Clinton everywhere else doing all these</text>
  <text start="261.33" dur="4.05">other things that were illegal and</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="5.82">corrupt and criminal and including other</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="6.42">foreign governments and such now we also</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="6.3">have same same topic Ukraine situation a</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="4.35">corrupt Obama ambassador refusing to</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="3.42">allow Ukrainian officials officials</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="4.97">government officials to enter the u.s.</text>
  <text start="278.22" dur="5.25">why because they had evidence of Obama</text>
  <text start="281.12" dur="3.76">administration&amp;#39;s misconduct to give</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="3.72">Trump officials they had evidence on</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="3.39">Obama and she&amp;#39;s not letting them in</text>
  <text start="287.19" dur="4.17">country what is that</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="6.72">telling you we also have another media</text>
  <text start="291.36" dur="5.64">line blowing up in their face Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="4.799">government initiated contact with Trump</text>
  <text start="297" dur="5.19">not the other way around and Giuliani&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.789" dur="4.41">involvement was requested by the State</text>
  <text start="302.19" dur="3.659">Department so I showed you guys the clip</text>
  <text start="304.199" dur="3.541">earlier where Giuliani says they fell</text>
  <text start="305.849" dur="4.141">into a trap and there they&amp;#39;re busted</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="6.329">basically and that was fascinating</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="5.34">definitely worth a check out I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="314.069" dur="5.28">I&amp;#39;m getting some interruptions here</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="6.239">let&amp;#39;s see anyway Democrat lawmaker</text>
  <text start="319.349" dur="4.051">defending Obama&amp;#39;s administration spying</text>
  <text start="321.569" dur="5.671">on the Trump campaign during a committee</text>
  <text start="323.4" dur="5.07">hearing now isn&amp;#39;t that interesting I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="328.47" dur="5.099">half hour video however from the</text>
  <text start="330.69" dur="5.46">Washington Examiner Steve Cohen and</text>
  <text start="333.569" dur="4.581">Democrat from Tennessee defended spying</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="4.35">on the opposition party quote</text>

  <text start="342.479" dur="4.021">Court it appears that some of the other</text>
  <text start="345.06" dur="2.789">side I&amp;#39;ve got a problem with a lot of</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="4.74">things that have gone on in law</text>
  <text start="347.849" dur="4.741">enforcement I read all those Bisons in</text>
  <text start="351.24" dur="4.62">the Carter page and saw nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="352.59" dur="4.949">with in here representative John</text>
  <text start="355.86" dur="3.69">Radcliffe the Texas Republican who</text>
  <text start="357.539" dur="3.06">withdrew from consideration as the</text>

  <text start="368.909" dur="3.721">who&amp;#39;s wrong Ratcliffe said and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="371.039" dur="3.091">afraid unfortunately that the Inspector</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="3.42">General is going to find that folks on</text>
  <text start="374.13" dur="3.629">my side of the aisle or write that</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="2.76">five-set procedures were abused and were</text>
  <text start="377.759" dur="3.361">not followed and will offer</text>
  <text start="378.81" dur="6.06">recommendations to correct that but</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="6.449">again we&amp;#39;ll see interesting so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="5.789">nice way of basically just saying you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.569" dur="4.921">wrong illegalities did occurred here of</text>
  <text start="390.659" dur="3.421">course they&amp;#39;re gonna try to obfuscate</text>
  <text start="392.49" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re gonna try to muddy the waters</text>
  <text start="394.08" dur="3.6">because the Democrats aren&amp;#39;t smart</text>
  <text start="395.61" dur="3.54">enough by and large to understand the</text>
  <text start="397.68" dur="4.079">difference between you know illegal</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="4.38">spying coup d&amp;#39;etat versus you know law</text>
  <text start="401.759" dur="3.75">enforcement the standard procedure</text>
  <text start="403.53" dur="4.669">right they don&amp;#39;t know the difference and</text>
  <text start="405.509" dur="4.621">they really they fail to understand</text>
  <text start="408.199" dur="3.4">willfully they it&amp;#39;s a willful ignorance</text>
  <text start="410.13" dur="4.039">that&amp;#39;s what it is and it&amp;#39;s the worst</text>
  <text start="411.599" dur="5.94">kind of ignorance and ignorance I guess</text>
  <text start="414.169" dur="5.11">can be blessed but it really isn&amp;#39;t so we</text>
  <text start="417.539" dur="3.481">also have kind of switching topics and</text>
  <text start="419.279" dur="2.371">it goes back to the Hillary thing it</text>
  <text start="421.02" dur="1.619">goes</text>
  <text start="421.65" dur="3.78">back to the corruption at the highest</text>
  <text start="422.639" dur="5.581">levels but a slightly different angle</text>

  <text start="774.629" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a massive victory right</text>
  <text start="776.819" dur="5.25">there especially the Supreme Court but</text>
  <text start="779.009" dur="5.01">this this this is beautiful</text>

  <text start="815.579" dur="3.3">President Trump has the the right and</text>
  <text start="817.199" dur="3.541">the authority to do this so it&amp;#39;s just a</text>

  <text start="840.57" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;m not gonna lie</text>
  <text start="841.92" dur="4.2">going up against the Clintons judges may</text>
  <text start="844.14" dur="4.14">die but it won&amp;#39;t last for very long</text>
  <text start="846.12" dur="4.35">because people are already awake to what</text>
  <text start="848.28" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re doing we already seen people</text>

  <text start="857.43" dur="4.32">backfiring on them it would backfire</text>
  <text start="858.87" dur="5.04">there too so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="861.75" dur="3.69">eventually we will find justice through</text>
  <text start="863.91" dur="3.93">the courts because eventually the</text>
