  <text start="32.87" dur="4.86">most of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and I</text>
  <text start="35.36" dur="5.16">want to make some commentary about some</text>
  <text start="37.73" dur="9.719">historic events today as Nancy Pelosi in</text>
  <text start="40.52" dur="9.719">these and these and these crazy Dems</text>
  <text start="47.449" dur="5.491">start trying to impeach our president he</text>
  <text start="50.239" dur="9.511">is over there making historic speeches</text>

  <text start="63.53" dur="6">hot in here because of lights and</text>

  <text start="69.53" dur="4.02">guys I don&amp;#39;t want to make you watch all</text>
  <text start="71.3" dur="3.66">of these different videos you know</text>
  <text start="73.55" dur="4.08">obviously there&amp;#39;s a whole speech and you</text>
  <text start="74.96" dur="5.01">should watch the entire thing but um a</text>
  <text start="77.63" dur="6.57">couple of just major points</text>
  <text start="79.97" dur="6.36">he kind of snubbed the climate change</text>
  <text start="84.2" dur="4.95">panel and instead spoke of religious</text>
  <text start="86.33" dur="4.98">freedom and supposedly now it&amp;#39;s leaked</text>
  <text start="89.15" dur="4.02">out that he is trying to form sort of a</text>
  <text start="91.31" dur="4.98">coalition at the at the National or</text>
  <text start="93.17" dur="7.35">United Nations level to protect unborn</text>
  <text start="96.29" dur="5.61">life so a religious freedoms thing</text>
  <text start="100.52" dur="2.389">because you know obviously a lot of</text>
  <text start="101.9" dur="3.899">countries are now pushing</text>
  <text start="102.909" dur="5.921">taxpayer-funded abortions so a religious</text>
  <text start="105.799" dur="6.39">freedoms movement at an international</text>
  <text start="108.83" dur="5.969">level to try to oppose abortion because</text>
  <text start="112.189" dur="4.831">we&amp;#39;re winning that war at home slowly</text>
  <text start="114.799" dur="5.091">but surely we are winning that war the</text>
  <text start="117.02" dur="4.919">culture war is being won and and and</text>
  <text start="119.89" dur="4.51">before I dive into some of the other</text>
  <text start="121.939" dur="4.831">major speeches and such today but I</text>
  <text start="124.4" dur="4.23">should probably also mention in terms of</text>
  <text start="126.77" dur="3.27">the culture being won some of the</text>
  <text start="128.63" dur="3.329">Democrat frontrunner for the</text>
  <text start="130.04" dur="5.28">presidential campaign probably way more</text>
  <text start="131.959" dur="5.131">you know popular in actual terms you</text>
  <text start="135.32" dur="3.9">know actual voter turnout that kind of</text>
  <text start="137.09" dur="4.2">thing not the the rigged fake news but</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="5.1">because she&amp;#39;s being blocked from some of</text>
  <text start="141.29" dur="6.09">the other you know debates and such but</text>
  <text start="144.32" dur="5.61">you know she&amp;#39;s actually fairly moderate</text>
  <text start="147.38" dur="5.76">compared to the left wildly popular for</text>
  <text start="149.93" dur="5.13">it and culturally speaking she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.14" dur="4.47">defending free speech we have won this</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="5.04">fight their own team</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="4.53">is starting to turn against them so you</text>
  <text start="160.1" dur="5.43">know that&amp;#39;s one really really exciting</text>
  <text start="162.14" dur="5.88">thing we also have Trump saying the</text>
  <text start="165.53" dur="6">future does not belong to globalists it</text>
  <text start="168.02" dur="6.09">belongs to Patriots now Mike Rothschild</text>
  <text start="171.53" dur="5.22">on Twitter you know that that fool he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.11" dur="3.96">already trying to say that globalist</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="3.09">means Jew</text>
  <text start="178.07" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s like code word for some sort of</text>
  <text start="179.84" dur="1.92">anti-semitic phrase or something like</text>
  <text start="181.55" dur="2.7">that</text>
  <text start="181.76" dur="5.46">and that&amp;#39;s not true at all globalist if</text>
  <text start="184.25" dur="5.25">anything probably means communist but in</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="4.89">at least in the modern sense but it just</text>
  <text start="189.5" dur="5.4">means selling out your country for the</text>
  <text start="192.11" dur="6.09">interests of another you know group of</text>
  <text start="194.9" dur="5.46">people so it&amp;#39;s sort of the action and</text>
  <text start="198.2" dur="5.27">it&amp;#39;s understandable if you believe in</text>
  <text start="200.36" dur="5.31">that sort of that you know one world</text>
  <text start="203.47" dur="5.56">sort of government or that one world</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="5.43">fits all you know but I you know I guess</text>
  <text start="209.03" dur="3.42">conservatives now or the party of you</text>
  <text start="211.1" dur="3.84">know diversity we will actually want to</text>
  <text start="212.45" dur="4.2">maintain various types of cultures in</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="3.42">their in their natural habitat and have</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="4.32">respect for each other and sort of</text>
  <text start="218.36" dur="4.14">win-win work together but globalism is</text>
  <text start="220.97" dur="2.43">the opposite of that it&amp;#39;s a merger of</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="3.12">all things</text>
  <text start="223.4" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s the breakdown of all cultures in</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="8.94">the beginning of a slave society where</text>
  <text start="228.83" dur="8.49">everyone has to be the same and you know</text>
  <text start="234.56" dur="5.07">that that&amp;#39;s sort of the Orwell stuff if</text>
  <text start="237.32" dur="5.01">you go down that path 1984 an animal</text>
  <text start="239.63" dur="5.16">form that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what would happen so</text>
  <text start="242.33" dur="4.92">kind of switching back from the culture</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="4.44">talk and and the speech talk here that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s bringing it right along because</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="4.2">obviously the globalists would be like</text>
  <text start="251.72" dur="3.69">the soros faction the hillary clinton</text>
  <text start="253.43" dur="5.52">faction the biden selling us out now to</text>
