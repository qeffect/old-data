  <text start="17.52" dur="4.2">guys who haven&amp;#39;t heard about it yet or</text>
  <text start="19.05" dur="4.26">anything I jumped right into it I even</text>
  <text start="21.72" dur="3.18">started my own little like custom badges</text>
  <text start="23.31" dur="3.66">and stuff like my grandpa&amp;#39;s old Boy</text>
  <text start="24.9" dur="3.81">Scout badges cuz I just thought you</text>

  <text start="28.71" dur="3.93">dollar hat from Walmart that&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="30.449" dur="3.601">getting a little dirty but hey we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="39.36" dur="2.64">little bit about you about your</text>
  <text start="40.32" dur="3.509">background and how you got into this but</text>
  <text start="42" dur="9.71">what is it about the white hat movement</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="7.881">specifically that excited you the idea</text>
  <text start="51.829" dur="6.131">while watching some videos on Antipa and</text>
  <text start="55.86" dur="9">the guys out there causing a lot of</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="8.909">habits in cities so it&amp;#39;s just the whole</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="4.799">idea that they were silencing people</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="6.481">while wearing Matt I&amp;#39;m not really having</text>
  <text start="69.659" dur="6.75">much of an opinion just basically being</text>
  <text start="73.35" dur="6.33">fascist and so I was sitting here one</text>
  <text start="76.409" dur="4.831">night and thought I&amp;#39;ve got a white hat</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="4.35">over here I&amp;#39;m gonna throw a white hat on</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="4.89">here and and show my face and speak the</text>
  <text start="84.03" dur="3.93">truth since that I&amp;#39;m learning from</text>
  <text start="86.13" dur="7.23">people like yourself and you know</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="8.13">there&amp;#39;s on YouTube and you know put the</text>
  <text start="93.36" dur="7.5">facts out there which they are wearing</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="6.12">the white hat which represents goodness</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="5.85">and you&amp;#39;re the good guy wears the white</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="7.589">hat and you know good over evil and</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="4.38">things of that nature I thought okay</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="2.82">I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and start reaching out to</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="3.87">some people and see if I can find some</text>
  <text start="112.619" dur="4.561">ambassadors which you so graciously done</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="4.409">and I really appreciate it and it</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="4.289">excites me that I can even get an idea</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="4.471">that just kind of popped into my head</text>
  <text start="121.469" dur="4.68">you had a good idea I&amp;#39;m having to run</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="5.72">with it so I appreciate that</text>
  <text start="126.149" dur="6.331">you know aspect but it comes down to we</text>
  <text start="129.56" dur="3.7">could definitely go deeper into but</text>
  <text start="132.48" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="5.61">basics of the whole thing needed and you</text>
  <text start="136.62" dur="4.229">know the white hat like you said you you</text>
  <text start="138.87" dur="4.289">have your patch on there I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.849" dur="4.47">fantastic and you can continue to do so</text>
  <text start="143.159" dur="3.871">if things that you believe in and things</text>
  <text start="145.319" dur="3.571">that represent you and the message that</text>
  <text start="147.03" dur="4.5">you want to get out there kind of like a</text>
  <text start="148.89" dur="5.25">whiteboard so you know I just basically</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="4.98">took the black marker and put my cue on</text>
  <text start="154.14" dur="4.23">the front here and I put it on the side</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="4.08">did I for driving on some people could</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="3.42">see it maybe hey what&amp;#39;s that I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="160.59" dur="3.539">about that on the news</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="5.759">on the other side here I have a 22 which</text>
  <text start="164.129" dur="5.761">representing the 20 suicides today that</text>
  <text start="167.549" dur="5.19">I think and then where we go one you go</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="4.62">all I saw on the side I&amp;#39;m gonna do that</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="4.59">on mine yeah that&amp;#39;s awesome actually I</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="5.61">like that a lot but at the same time I</text>
  <text start="177.329" dur="5">could add a flag I can add you know</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="5.1">anything about veterans anything about</text>
  <text start="182.329" dur="5.74">representing the blue line the police</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="7.53">EMS you know I&amp;#39;m a paramedic myself and</text>
  <text start="188.069" dur="6.48">and we we can see the safety issues out</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="4.949">there in the world we have to take</text>
  <text start="194.549" dur="5.91">precautions ourselves and trying to</text>
  <text start="197.699" dur="5.341">spread that at my job right now is is</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="5.49">being aware of what you say to certain</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="5.97">people and how to protect yourself out</text>
  <text start="205.949" dur="7.26">there and not have strangers coming up</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="6.659">to your window well I kind of something</text>
  <text start="213.209" dur="4.081">on my screen I guess I&amp;#39;ve been opening</text>
  <text start="215.669" dur="5.21">my door to do work so there&amp;#39;s probably a</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="7.11">couple flies in here unfortunately but I</text>
  <text start="220.879" dur="5.11">I&amp;#39;ve been kind of comparing it to the</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="3.839">mag I had I mean I&amp;#39;ve got my mega hat</text>
  <text start="225.989" dur="4.83">you know and and that is cool too which</text>
  <text start="228.239" dur="3.72">is actually kind of the the free version</text>
  <text start="230.819" dur="4.441">instead of the great was like make</text>
  <text start="231.959" dur="5.071">America free again but you know I saw it</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="3.689">as a way to represent not only just like</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="3.419">your your q and on support like you</text>
  <text start="238.949" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t even have to necessarily be a Q</text>
  <text start="240.449" dur="4.051">guy to do this you know my first thought</text>
  <text start="242.579" dur="4.291">like I said um we had talked about this</text>
  <text start="244.5" dur="4.53">briefly before but was like good good</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="4.459">spy versus bad spot you know you guys</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="4.62">have seen the old like 2d cartoons and</text>
  <text start="251.329" dur="4.421">and I thought that you know immediately</text>
  <text start="253.65" dur="5.28">like yes this is it this is a way for us</text>
  <text start="255.75" dur="5.22">to represent in in public in visual</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="3.93">terms like just like the sea of red hats</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="3.93">at the Trump events why don&amp;#39;t we have a</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="3.99">sea of white house out there and and you</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="3.45">know I thought for Q and on but the same</text>
  <text start="266.85" dur="4.65">point you&amp;#39;re right you can use it for</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="5.34">you know for whatever white hat or truth</text>
  <text start="271.5" dur="4.65">or topic that you hold close to your</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="3.81">heart I mean you could use it for for</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="3.06">the thin blue line you could use it for</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="4.32">a holistic health stuff I mean you could</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="6.72">talk about everything I just do it</text>
  <text start="281.82" dur="7.38">really that&amp;#39;s exactly the point you know</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="5.85">I almost think of it as that the stripes</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="6.03">on the white flag are on our American</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="6.09">flag it represents the unity that</text>
  <text start="295.23" dur="7.5">represents purity the goodness the truth</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="7.29">of who we are as a nation and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="302.73" dur="4.89">amazing to be part of this whole humint</text>
  <text start="305.16" dur="5.51">and being red pilled and talking to</text>
  <text start="307.62" dur="6.78">people like you and learning the truth</text>
  <text start="310.67" dur="6.79">it&amp;#39;s been a great experience and and 32</text>
  <text start="314.4" dur="6.27">even include me in my small little part</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="4.86">I feel with the white hat movement my</text>
  <text start="320.67" dur="4.29">job is to spread good information and</text>
  <text start="322.32" dur="4.71">ideas that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I do as freely</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="6.75">and it&amp;#39;s decentralized and open source</text>
  <text start="327.03" dur="5.85">as I can my you you had turned me on to</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="3.21">this and I&amp;#39;m gonna do my best i</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="4.53">encourage everyone get you like a cheap</text>
  <text start="334.92" dur="3.93">white hat and and do your own thing you</text>
  <text start="337.41" dur="2.85">do not have to get these things i sell</text>

  <text start="344.79" dur="4.2">hat your purse your gym bag whatever</text>
  <text start="347.13" dur="3.45">it&amp;#39;s good conversational piece and</text>
  <text start="348.99" dur="2.85">you&amp;#39;ll be proud of it later it&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="3.81">those things you also if you go to a</text>
  <text start="351.84" dur="5.88">rally you know where you have patches</text>
  <text start="354.39" dur="6.45">pins badges on tickets and such and go</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="5.28">to these rallies and you could trade you</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="4.56">have to trade those things with people</text>
  <text start="363" dur="3.84">and and you know who&amp;#39;s who and you know</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="3.9">what they know it&amp;#39;s like a litmus test</text>
  <text start="366.84" dur="3.81">with a without as much violence like</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re wearing a red hat you might get</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="3.32">hurt in certain places you wear your</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="6.63">this not so much</text>
  <text start="373.97" dur="7.69">absolutely maybe but my goal is you know</text>
  <text start="378.99" dur="5.7">first of all this small goal up and use</text>
  <text start="381.66" dur="5.34">been met and I&amp;#39;m hoping that maybe more</text>
  <text start="384.69" dur="4.14">youtubers to you know not always wear</text>
  <text start="387" dur="3.57">half but every once in a while kind of</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="4.8">Kapton maybe have a white hat in the</text>
  <text start="390.57" dur="5.97">background like you do and and every</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="4.77">once in a while represented because we</text>
  <text start="396.54" dur="4.2">want to get that message out of positive</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="7.169">truth and</text>
  <text start="400.74" dur="6.45">- it would excite me to see a trump</text>
  <text start="405.569" dur="3.391">rally or the mother of all rallies</text>
  <text start="407.19" dur="3.75">having a lot of white hats because</text>
  <text start="408.96" dur="4.2">especially like mother of all rallies or</text>
  <text start="410.94" dur="4.62">the rally that just took place in</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="4.319">Portland Oregon you have all these these</text>
  <text start="415.56" dur="3.96">people wearing black representing evil</text>
  <text start="417.479" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s what they represent and to have</text>
  <text start="419.52" dur="7.92">the other side standing there with white</text>
  <text start="421.139" dur="10.321">hats I don&amp;#39;t know well he&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="6.27">powerful till they see a white hat would</text>
  <text start="431.46" dur="4.53">be amazing he is something that they</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="3.69">can&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t play their camera</text>
  <text start="435.99" dur="2.91">tricks with like if they&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="5.28">the audience you can&amp;#39;t ignore those red</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="5.699">hats okay you to that point it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="3.54">just real blatant and obvious they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="444.599" dur="3.781">just diminish us and call us some like</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="4.08">conspiracy fringe cult if we&amp;#39;re like the</text>
  <text start="448.38" dur="4.74">majority of the audience and the in the</text>

  <text start="455.55" dur="5.339">lot of the few signs away from the rally</text>
  <text start="457.409" dur="4.5">I believe they did I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="460.889" dur="3.391">that&amp;#39;s gonna I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="461.909" dur="4.371">a continual thing that was sort of a you</text>
  <text start="464.28" dur="6.09">know there was an assassination like</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="5.949">there was like a threat and and we</text>
  <text start="470.37" dur="3.359">suspect that one of the people that was</text>
  <text start="472.229" dur="3.87">involved in that threat was trying to</text>
  <text start="473.729" dur="8.341">come in as a cue a non supporter so I</text>

  <text start="828.66" dur="3.75">there because you know people like to</text>
  <text start="830.19" dur="6.48">hear other people&amp;#39;s few stories and how</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="9.99">they learned about it well let&amp;#39;s say the</text>
  <text start="836.67" dur="9.03">middle of December I went on YouTube on</text>
  <text start="842.4" dur="5.01">my TV which I&amp;#39;d never done before I</text>
  <text start="845.7" dur="4.29">didn&amp;#39;t even need to do that and pop it</text>
  <text start="847.41" dur="4.73">on there and Jennifer Hammonds was the</text>
  <text start="849.99" dur="5.33">first one on and she was talking about</text>
  <text start="852.14" dur="6.16">9/11 and she had the indictment papers</text>
  <text start="855.32" dur="7.84">and it it just kind of rolled over into</text>
  <text start="858.3" dur="7.14">cue and I don&amp;#39;t know who the first</text>
  <text start="863.16" dur="4.5">person I listened to was but you know</text>
  <text start="865.44" dur="4.35">this was when anti school and you were</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="4.17">working together with the Tasha feat and</text>
  <text start="869.79" dur="6.78">I kind of got involved in that and then</text>
  <text start="871.83" dur="6.75">Lisle Nation just started following some</text>
  <text start="876.57" dur="4.94">intelligent people like yourself and</text>
  <text start="878.58" dur="5.37">started learning things that I already</text>
  <text start="881.51" dur="5.41">kind of had an idea what&amp;#39;s going on you</text>
  <text start="883.95" dur="6.99">know the 911 and the JFK and everything</text>
  <text start="886.92" dur="6.3">in between it&amp;#39;s kind of it put a lot of</text>
  <text start="890.94" dur="4.14">threads together you know listening to</text>
  <text start="893.22" dur="4.49">you guys and going down the rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="895.08" dur="5.49">which I was reluctantly going down and</text>
  <text start="897.71" dur="8.32">so it&amp;#39;s been a great experience</text>
  <text start="900.57" dur="7.8">q I&amp;#39;ve listened to your debates I</text>
  <text start="906.03" dur="4.5">believe your cue proofs I&amp;#39;ve seen plenty</text>
  <text start="908.37" dur="6.51">of cue proofs I don&amp;#39;t need to sit here</text>
  <text start="910.53" dur="6.9">and analyze it too deep and down to the</text>
  <text start="914.88" dur="4.5">people I&amp;#39;m listening to truthers you</text>
  <text start="917.43" dur="5.34">just listen to the other side we can you</text>
  <text start="919.38" dur="5.13">can hear the propaganda yeah what do you</text>
  <text start="922.77" dur="3.78">think of these people that are all media</text>
  <text start="924.51" dur="4.17">that are that are coming out and just</text>
  <text start="926.55" dur="4.95">using the same kind of MSM tricks of</text>
  <text start="928.68" dur="7.01">insulting and using fake edited proofs</text>
  <text start="931.5" dur="8.94">and not using actual arguments it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="935.69" dur="9.209">blatant it&amp;#39;s ridiculous and I&amp;#39;m sorry if</text>
  <text start="940.44" dur="7.17">people can&amp;#39;t see that that they not -</text>
  <text start="944.899" dur="7.981">it&amp;#39;s either you follow you to pick a</text>
  <text start="947.61" dur="8.01">side thing so some of these people</text>
  <text start="952.88" dur="4.78">beginning that that we&amp;#39;re all about cue</text>
  <text start="955.62" dur="4.89">and then it&amp;#39;s switched I&amp;#39;ve heard your</text>
  <text start="957.66" dur="4.08">debates I know the people were talking I</text>
  <text start="960.51" dur="5.49">know you know the people were talking</text>
  <text start="961.74" dur="6.15">about and it&amp;#39;s why when something so</text>
  <text start="966" dur="5.88">good is happening something so truthful</text>
  <text start="967.89" dur="6.569">today even if they end up the queue ends</text>
  <text start="971.88" dur="4.53">up being a lard look how many people</text>
  <text start="974.459" dur="6.901">have actually woken up that&amp;#39;s the fruit</text>
  <text start="976.41" dur="9.84">of the tree no it just makes a bigger a</text>
  <text start="981.36" dur="7.71">bigger army so I think of it a positive</text>
  <text start="986.25" dur="5.97">thing I&amp;#39;m not doubting it so I&amp;#39;m going</text>

  <text start="1010.55" dur="3.78">like it&amp;#39;s it is very strange I think</text>
  <text start="1012.29" dur="4.2">when when these people that didn&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="1014.33" dur="4.56">about too much before or suddenly as the</text>
