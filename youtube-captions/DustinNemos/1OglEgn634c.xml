  <text start="27.469" dur="4.54">newborn baby daughter in the other room</text>

  <text start="37.26" dur="4.41">news of all so far that&amp;#39;s happened with</text>
  <text start="39.719" dur="3.961">this thing recently just to kind of let</text>
  <text start="41.67" dur="4.62">you know that this is a serious coin it</text>
  <text start="43.68" dur="4.68">hasn&amp;#39;t even launched its product yet but</text>
  <text start="46.29" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s already taken the 5th place from</text>
  <text start="48.36" dur="5.07">white coin which is you know pretty</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="5.67">interesting and it you know I&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="3.51">into its past performance in a second</text>
  <text start="55.44" dur="2.91">but it&amp;#39;s at fifteen dollars right now</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="3.36">which is kind of cool because I bought</text>
  <text start="58.35" dur="7.139">into some of it and like seven and a</text>
  <text start="60.3" dur="6.959">half a few days ago which is nice so let</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="5.971">me go through some of the notes I wanted</text>
  <text start="67.259" dur="6.241">to share with you guys so a little bit</text>
  <text start="71.46" dur="5.58">of backstory for people who don&amp;#39;t yet</text>
  <text start="73.5" dur="7.56">know about AI cos and alt coins and all</text>
  <text start="77.04" dur="5.31">of that stuff think of Bitcoin you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="4.95">probably heard of that one think of</text>
  <text start="82.35" dur="5.46">Bitcoin as the myspace before Facebook</text>
  <text start="86.01" dur="3.75">like it&amp;#39;s the first thing that showed up</text>
  <text start="87.81" dur="6.3">and was a well known name it&amp;#39;s the it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.76" dur="7.31">got the first in place benefit it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.11" dur="5.369">a brand you know it&amp;#39;s one form of mini</text>
  <text start="97.07" dur="4.21">crypto currencies out there and some</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="3.601">would say it&amp;#39;s not even the best you</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="3.03">know that they can change they can adapt</text>
  <text start="103.08" dur="3.359">they can get better they&amp;#39;re adding</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="3.989">things in they&amp;#39;re getting better but</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="3.391">there are other coins out there probably</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="3.601">are just already way better than Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="109.83" dur="4.32">but it&amp;#39;s still the biggest because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="111.9" dur="4.5">got the most recognition</text>
  <text start="114.15" dur="4.59">you could also more realistically get a</text>
  <text start="116.4" dur="3.469">little bit more nuance out of that if if</text>
  <text start="118.74" dur="3.96">you were to compare it to</text>
  <text start="119.869" dur="4.631">instead of MySpace versus Facebook cuz</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="3.989">myspace was completely destroyed when</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="5.22">Facebook came along and just completely</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="6.541">gone now defunct compare it instead to</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="5.939">Facebook versus all of the other things</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="4.17">that are out now there&amp;#39;s like hundreds</text>
  <text start="135.659" dur="3.241">of social media sites now and Facebook</text>
  <text start="137.4" dur="3.62">is still there it&amp;#39;s still big it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="5.259">prominent but it&amp;#39;s losing market share</text>
  <text start="141.02" dur="5.48">that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="144.159" dur="4.021">Bitcoin versus the altcoins and</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="4.019">sometimes it gains a little bit of the</text>
  <text start="148.18" dur="4.669">market share back it&amp;#39;s called Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="150.519" dur="8.041">market dominance sometimes it loses some</text>
  <text start="152.849" dur="7.121">it ebbs and tides but that&amp;#39;s kind of the</text>
  <text start="158.56" dur="2.039">nature of where things are right now and</text>
  <text start="159.97" dur="2.639">that&amp;#39;s a good thing</text>
  <text start="160.599" dur="4.551">you want you want competition and</text>
  <text start="162.609" dur="4.981">anything that you buy or use or or</text>
  <text start="165.15" dur="5.38">purchase or fund or anything like that</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="6.42">because competition breeds quality</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="7.859">competition forces quality and it forces</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="6.78">better price better value because</text>
  <text start="178.389" dur="3.99">competition is a wonderful wonderful</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="3.569">thing it&amp;#39;s one of the beauties of</text>
  <text start="182.379" dur="5.42">capitalism that has brought us so many</text>
  <text start="184.359" dur="5.25">wonderful things so never underestimate</text>
  <text start="187.799" dur="3.461">competition which is what governments</text>
  <text start="189.609" dur="3.421">don&amp;#39;t want they don&amp;#39;t want this kind of</text>
  <text start="191.26" dur="3.449">currency to become competition to their</text>
  <text start="193.03" dur="4.62">currency central banks are very much</text>
  <text start="194.709" dur="5.191">against this stuff anyway</text>
  <text start="197.65" dur="3.72">so that&amp;#39;s kind of Bitcoin versus the</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="4.739">other coins I also want to talk a little</text>
  <text start="201.37" dur="4.8">bit about I SEOs all right if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="204.639" dur="3.091">ever looked at stocks or anything you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="3.779">heard of an IPO an initial public</text>
  <text start="207.73" dur="3.719">offering that&amp;#39;s when the company first</text>
  <text start="209.949" dur="4.081">hits the stock market they&amp;#39;re not worth</text>
  <text start="211.449" dur="4.44">much yet it&amp;#39;s you know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="214.03" dur="3.48">will get in on deals and discounts for</text>
  <text start="215.889" dur="8.641">buying and a lot at once things like</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="9.149">that early on an IPO is when you do it</text>
  <text start="224.53" dur="3.959">with a company on the stock market an IC</text>
  <text start="226.659" dur="3.3">o---- is the initial coin offering which</text>
  <text start="228.489" dur="3.39">is when you do basically the same thing</text>
  <text start="229.959" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s just that it&amp;#39;s a startup company</text>
  <text start="231.879" dur="6.33">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a tech startup company</text>
  <text start="233.799" dur="6.87">technically but when you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="238.209" dur="4.65">starting up one of those and you fund</text>
  <text start="240.669" dur="6.21">yourself through an IC o---- and which</text>
  <text start="242.859" dur="6.24">is a very high risk investment m&amp;#39;as</text>
  <text start="246.879" dur="6.57">people do exit scams things like that</text>
  <text start="249.099" dur="6.151">that happened to me with Krissy o so</text>
  <text start="253.449" dur="3.69">they didn&amp;#39;t exactly exit scam but they</text>
  <text start="255.25" dur="5.209">funded their company got started right</text>
  <text start="257.139" dur="5.821">after the big Bitcoin drop happened and</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="6.221">it kind of kicked their about a little</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="5.61">bit so it&amp;#39;s understandable but that</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="4.35">happened to virtually everything in the</text>
  <text start="268.57" dur="4.56">market except for a few companies that</text>
  <text start="271.03" dur="3.93">survived which is again competition</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="7.47">weeds out the bad ones</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="9.72">so EOS is a I see o it is a unlocked</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="7.7">project it is a alpha development stage</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="7.019">whatever you want to call it that said</text>
  <text start="288.3" dur="7.45">it is a lot less risky than most of the</text>
  <text start="291.699" dur="7.44">ICS out there because the guy behind it</text>
  <text start="295.75" dur="4.86">okay and in what it is as well what it</text>
  <text start="299.139" dur="6.421">is is very promising but the guy behind</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="10.95">it is Daniel Larimer and he&amp;#39;s the guy</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="9.329">who created steam it so and to get some</text>
  <text start="311.56" dur="6">water there it&amp;#39;s nicknamed the etherium</text>
  <text start="314.889" dur="4.921">killer it aims to make aetherium which</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="3.84">is already technically right now you</text>
  <text start="319.81" dur="5.22">guys can see it over here it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="321.4" dur="5.97">second biggest cryptocurrency and you</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="4.44">can even look at you know the change</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="3.84">lately and this is coin market Capcom</text>
  <text start="329.47" dur="3.69">really useful if you&amp;#39;re looking into</text>
  <text start="331.21" dur="7.2">this stuff or just want to do some</text>
  <text start="333.16" dur="9.99">research Bitcoin has looks like eight</text>
  <text start="338.41" dur="9.259">point six billion in volume in the last</text>
  <text start="343.15" dur="8.37">24 hours has 157 billion almost in</text>
  <text start="347.669" dur="8.261">market cap and</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="11.7">etherium is at 65 billion okay so over a</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="11.669">third of bitcoins size and bitcoins at</text>
  <text start="363.22" dur="6.96">92 hundreds if there is at 65 657 I mean</text>
  <text start="367.599" dur="4.711">and you can see the volumes a little bit</text>
  <text start="370.18" dur="4.38">lower but but overall aetherium is</text>
  <text start="372.31" dur="4.44">already gaining quickly on Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="374.56" dur="4.65">it has been for quite a while because</text>
  <text start="376.75" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s a much better quality system in</text>
  <text start="379.21" dur="4.889">many ways Bitcoin is just a block chain</text>
  <text start="382.06" dur="6.32">based cryptocurrency aetherium is a</text>
  <text start="384.099" dur="7.051">platform it&amp;#39;s a currency it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="388.38" dur="4.45">platform to use other technologies on</text>
  <text start="391.15" dur="3.96">and other people could develop</text>
  <text start="392.83" dur="4.829">technologies to go on this platform so</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="5.33">they would be the beneficiary of all of</text>
  <text start="397.659" dur="2.781">that activity and</text>
  <text start="400.85" dur="3.84">in aetherium they have things like smart</text>
  <text start="402.98" dur="3.24">contracts things like that these are the</text>
  <text start="404.69" dur="5.19">kind of things that are very exciting to</text>
  <text start="406.22" dur="5.34">businesses it helps them a lot maybe not</text>
  <text start="409.88" dur="3.06">so much to the end user who just wants</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="6.9">to send and receive money and things</text>
  <text start="412.94" dur="9.57">like that but let&amp;#39;s continue on a little</text>
  <text start="418.46" dur="6.35">bit here the point is Bitcoin in</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="4.38">aetherium competing there at the top</text>
  <text start="424.81" dur="4.69">theorems kicking its butt because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.89" dur="5.34">just so much better and in a technology</text>
  <text start="429.5" dur="3.87">like this in an industry like this just</text>
  <text start="432.23" dur="2.43">like with cell phones it&amp;#39;s just gonna</text>
  <text start="433.37" dur="4.11">keep getting better and better and</text>
  <text start="434.66" dur="4.44">better for forever hopefully but for</text>
  <text start="437.48" dur="3.87">quite a while at least especially right</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="3.9">now in the early stages so there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="441.35" dur="3.06">this competition there&amp;#39;s all these ideas</text>
  <text start="443" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s all this innovation there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="444.41" dur="3.72">these returns it&amp;#39;s so exciting and</text>
  <text start="446.27" dur="3.93">everything is going on and it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="448.13" dur="4.62">like 1% of the world even involved yet</text>
  <text start="450.2" dur="4.83">so there&amp;#39;s all of this upside potential</text>
  <text start="452.75" dur="5.31">as more of the world adopts this stuff</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="5.94">as it gets better as that wonderful</text>
  <text start="458.06" dur="6.99">force of competition continues to</text>
  <text start="460.97" dur="6.51">improve it and EOS nicknamed the</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="5.64">etherium killer is basically aetherium</text>
  <text start="467.48" dur="7.05">2.0 is just more advanced it solves the</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="5.46">scaling issue aetherium has EOS just</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="3.8">like aetherium will be more than just a</text>
  <text start="476.15" dur="5.25">cryptocurrency it will be a platform I</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="4.54">think yeah I don&amp;#39;t quote me on this but</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="5.13">I think they have a lot more privacy</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="5.46">strength as well for anonymity but I</text>
  <text start="486.53" dur="4.17">might be misremembering that with a</text>
  <text start="488.33" dur="5.22">different one I looked up either way I</text>
  <text start="490.7" dur="5.97">still really like this one a lot it is a</text>
  <text start="493.55" dur="5.46">blockchain based smart technology and</text>
  <text start="496.67" dur="5.03">other companies will also like I said</text>
  <text start="499.01" dur="7.89">build stuff for this platform and and</text>
  <text start="501.7" dur="6.97">create that sort of synergistic you know</text>
  <text start="506.9" dur="7.32">helping each other to grow stronger as a</text>
  <text start="508.67" dur="7.41">whole and even though the project has</text>
  <text start="514.22" dur="4.23">not officially launched which I think</text>
  <text start="516.08" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s coming pretty soon and it is</text>
  <text start="518.45" dur="4.74">still in development right now it has a</text>
  <text start="520.61" dur="4.83">lot of buzz excitement and energy in the</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="4.32">space and you know if you&amp;#39;re into</text>
  <text start="525.44" dur="4.32">investing at all it seems like most of</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="4.11">the time is the emotion and the energy</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="3.69">and then in the excitement factors that</text>
  <text start="531.62" dur="3.15">really determine the price in the short</text>
  <text start="533.45" dur="3.78">time</text>
  <text start="534.77" dur="7.41">so you can you can actually make good</text>
  <text start="537.23" dur="7.92">money basing your decisions off of off</text>
  <text start="542.18" dur="4.89">the the market excitement in this kind</text>
  <text start="545.15" dur="4.83">of thing which is kind of like gambling</text>
  <text start="547.07" dur="7.11">to be honest it&amp;#39;s definitely not like a</text>
  <text start="549.98" dur="6.21">fundamental investor but people you know</text>
  <text start="554.18" dur="6.15">they they buy the rumor and sell the</text>
  <text start="556.19" dur="5.97">news a lot of times so it&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="4.86">stolen like I said the fifth biggest</text>
  <text start="562.16" dur="4.53">cryptocurrency space even though it has</text>
  <text start="565.19" dur="8.37">not started yet that&amp;#39;s pretty impressive</text>
  <text start="566.69" dur="9.3">and it is possibly been a fallback by</text>
  <text start="573.56" dur="5.96">the time you guys watch this this is 427</text>
  <text start="575.99" dur="11.04">and it&amp;#39;s pretty strongly there right now</text>
  <text start="579.52" dur="9.91">but let&amp;#39;s see where was I - here now I</text>
  <text start="587.03" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t tell you for the same reason that</text>
  <text start="589.43" dur="3.36">I just mentioned like depending on when</text>
  <text start="591.59" dur="2.55">you watch this I don&amp;#39;t know what the</text>
  <text start="592.79" dur="3.57">state and you also be I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="594.14" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;ll be nearing a high and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="596.36" dur="4.35">terrible time to buy in or or at the</text>
  <text start="599.03" dur="3.39">bottom and it&amp;#39;s a great time to buy and</text>
  <text start="600.71" dur="5.01">I have I cannot make that decision for</text>
  <text start="602.42" dur="6.33">you but I will tell you when making the</text>
  <text start="605.72" dur="6.09">decision for myself I look less at where</text>
  <text start="608.75" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s at in the day like I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="611.81" dur="4.47">know if I&amp;#39;d want to buy in right now</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="5.01">because it just went up so much it like</text>
  <text start="616.28" dur="5.7">doubled in a week which is really cool</text>
  <text start="618.68" dur="5.16">but is it about to crash back down is it</text>
  <text start="621.98" dur="3.96">about to have somewhat of a correction I</text>
  <text start="623.84" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t know so I would be a little</text>
  <text start="625.94" dur="4.17">hesitant to buy a lot right now until I</text>
  <text start="627.83" dur="4.35">think of it this way well it&amp;#39;s still not</text>
  <text start="630.11" dur="3.84">even launched yet so it&amp;#39;s not even going</text>
  <text start="632.18" dur="3.51">to be near its full value when it does</text>
  <text start="633.95" dur="3.27">get launched it&amp;#39;s probably going to get</text>
  <text start="635.69" dur="3.21">launched successfully because it&amp;#39;s got a</text>

  <text start="709.75" dur="6.04">rant just one second about centralized</text>
  <text start="712.55" dur="5.43">and decentralized we&amp;#39;re gonna face a</text>

  <text start="1118.96" dur="4.36">there are other indicators that you can</text>

  <text start="1123.32" dur="5.52">this is just nice to kind of see where</text>
  <text start="1126.11" dur="7.38">it&amp;#39;s at what the tops have been like if</text>
  <text start="1128.84" dur="6">I scroll all the way back to what&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1133.49" dur="6.36">been going for long it&amp;#39;s only been going</text>
  <text start="1134.84" dur="6.99">since late 2017 but if I scroll all the</text>
  <text start="1139.85" dur="5.88">way back I can see that we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="1141.83" dur="11.75">actually hit this high before so it was</text>
  <text start="1145.73" dur="7.85">up to two here let&amp;#39;s see where is that</text>
  <text start="1155.399" dur="6.51">well it was up to here which is it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1159.989" dur="4.82">BTC so I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s point zero zero</text>
  <text start="1161.909" dur="4.801">one two Bitcoin in the current terms but</text>
  <text start="1164.809" dur="3.58">those two dollars it&amp;#39;ll be a little</text>
  <text start="1166.71" dur="5.699">simpler okay</text>
  <text start="1168.389" dur="6.03">so we were up to about sixteen once and</text>
  <text start="1172.409" dur="4.38">then it crashed way down then it went</text>
  <text start="1174.419" dur="4.14">right back up and then it stayed there</text>
  <text start="1176.789" dur="4.47">for a little bit crashed way back down</text>
  <text start="1178.559" dur="4.59">again then we&amp;#39;ve had it jump up here</text>
  <text start="1181.259" dur="4.05">another jump up here another jump here</text>
  <text start="1183.149" dur="3.931">and another jump here and it looks like</text>
  <text start="1185.309" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s trying to fight for another one</text>
  <text start="1187.08" dur="7.11">this just kind of tells you what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1190.049" dur="7.021">done in the past obviously this is this</text>
  <text start="1194.19" dur="4.949">is all I imagined that first bit there</text>
  <text start="1197.07" dur="3.63">was around some good news or maybe it</text>
  <text start="1199.139" dur="3.15">was just because it was so new and</text>
  <text start="1200.7" dur="3.059">people found out about it there was some</text>
  <text start="1202.289" dur="3.6">sort of surge of interest and then that</text>
  <text start="1203.759" dur="4.23">that sort of dropped down and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1205.889" dur="5.61">getting back into some interest they are</text>
  <text start="1207.989" dur="4.74">doing things like air drops of tokens</text>
  <text start="1211.499" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s like a marketing thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1212.729" dur="6.9">pretty common with some coins but</text>
  <text start="1216.629" dur="4.201">overall I think it&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1219.629" dur="3.27">ready to launch there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1220.83" dur="4.469">excitement building for that I don&amp;#39;t I</text>

  <text start="1225.299" dur="3.48">buy it&amp;#39;s probably good time to sell and</text>
  <text start="1226.889" dur="4.83">just wait because it it&amp;#39;s getting near</text>
  <text start="1228.779" dur="7.47">the highest point but if it were to drop</text>
  <text start="1231.719" dur="7.88">back down to anything under anything</text>
  <text start="1236.249" dur="6.03">under eight dollars would be great</text>
  <text start="1239.599" dur="5.32">anything around six or seven would be</text>
  <text start="1242.279" dur="4.02">amazing because that&amp;#39;s pretty seems like</text>
  <text start="1244.919" dur="4.771">it&amp;#39;s gonna be about as low as it gets</text>
  <text start="1246.299" dur="5.25">for a while like I said I&amp;#39;m definitely</text>
  <text start="1249.69" dur="3.75">not an expert on technical analysis it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1251.549" dur="4.891">just one little thing to add in just for</text>
  <text start="1253.44" dur="4.319">perspective it&amp;#39;s been said that it</text>
  <text start="1256.44" dur="3.059">doesn&amp;#39;t work that well with Kryptos</text>
  <text start="1257.759" dur="4.71">anyway cryptos are completely different</text>
  <text start="1259.499" dur="4.581">beasts in some sense from traditional</text>
  <text start="1262.469" dur="4.02">things that you would look at with a</text>
  <text start="1264.08" dur="4.029">technical analysis chart like this and</text>
  <text start="1266.489" dur="3.93">if you want to learn how to use these</text>
  <text start="1268.109" dur="4.65">things there&amp;#39;s a guy named crypto jack</text>
  <text start="1270.419" dur="4.68">and he has some great breakdown videos</text>
  <text start="1272.759" dur="3.36">and in fact there&amp;#39;s a ton of really</text>
  <text start="1275.099" dur="5.761">smart people that break these down</text>
  <text start="1276.119" dur="10.561">really easy to understand on on youtube</text>
  <text start="1280.86" dur="7.5">and that&amp;#39;s kind of it this is really</text>
  <text start="1286.68" dur="3.09">more I just wanted to talk about Yas a</text>
  <text start="1288.36" dur="2.88">little bit I&amp;#39;m not recommending people</text>
  <text start="1289.77" dur="3.9">buy it I&amp;#39;m not making financial</text>
  <text start="1291.24" dur="4.41">suggestions at all anyway but even if I</text>
  <text start="1293.67" dur="4.59">was I wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily go say buy it</text>
  <text start="1295.65" dur="5.55">now at the top I&amp;#39;m not gonna do that to</text>
  <text start="1298.26" dur="5.01">you guys but I don&amp;#39;t even know if it is</text>
  <text start="1301.2" dur="4.05">the top I mean everything in crypto just</text>
  <text start="1303.27" dur="4.23">went up basically like this in the last</text>
  <text start="1305.25" dur="3.78">week a lot of money came back into</text>
  <text start="1307.5" dur="4.02">crypto it was already kind of in a</text>
  <text start="1309.03" dur="4.92">depressed on sale price because of some</text>
  <text start="1311.52" dur="4.89">bad news and in the Bitcoin Mountain GOx</text>
  <text start="1313.95" dur="3.66">drop of twenty million dollars with the</text>
  <text start="1316.41" dur="2.64">Bitcoin it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of stuff</text>
  <text start="1317.61" dur="4.41">happen and made it go down temporarily</text>
  <text start="1319.05" dur="4.98">and now it&amp;#39;s just going back up so now</text>
  <text start="1322.02" dur="5.16">we&amp;#39;re at some semblance of normality</text>
  <text start="1324.03" dur="5.7">again I think it will continue its</text>
  <text start="1327.18" dur="5.1">uptrend but you know this is just kind</text>
  <text start="1329.73" dur="4.74">of an example because the real</text>
  <text start="1332.28" dur="4.23">excitement comes in when you start</text>
  <text start="1334.47" dur="4.29">looking at some of these numbers you</text>
  <text start="1336.51" dur="5.13">realize that EOS which has not even</text>
  <text start="1338.76" dur="7.62">launched officially is already the fifth</text>
  <text start="1341.64" dur="6.87">biggest market cap on the charts stolen</text>
  <text start="1346.38" dur="4.23">from litecoin which it&amp;#39;s already got a</text>
  <text start="1348.51" dur="4.74">good you know head start on litecoin</text>
  <text start="1350.61" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re eight point five two verses</text>
  <text start="1353.25" dur="6.84">twelve and a half billion so you know</text>
  <text start="1358.05" dur="3.45">EOS is at fifteen dollars now I got it</text>
  <text start="1360.09" dur="3.69">the other day when it was like seven</text>
  <text start="1361.5" dur="3.84">which is exciting but I&amp;#39;m more</text>
  <text start="1363.78" dur="4.14">interested in seeing it go up to be</text>
  <text start="1365.34" dur="5.49">aetherium killer which is currently</text>
  <text start="1367.92" dur="4.74">sitting at 657 so you see where you</text>
  <text start="1370.83" dur="4.77">could have sitting on this for a year</text>
  <text start="1372.66" dur="4.65">too and as it starts to effectively take</text>
  <text start="1375.6" dur="5.94">market share from a theorem you could go</text>
  <text start="1377.31" dur="7.53">from 15 per EOS to six or seven hundred</text>
  <text start="1381.54" dur="4.86">per EOS or who knows what remember all</text>
  <text start="1384.84" dur="3.3">of these numbers there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="1386.4" dur="3.99">money out there wanting better money</text>
  <text start="1388.14" dur="4.56">because only 1% of the world uses</text>
  <text start="1390.39" dur="3.63">Bitcoin right now more people are going</text>
  <text start="1392.7" dur="3.87">to come in there&amp;#39;s a lot of excitement</text>
  <text start="1394.02" dur="4.17">you even have like the the CEO of Nasdaq</text>
  <text start="1396.57" dur="6.44">saying he might be interested in in</text>
  <text start="1398.19" dur="7.14">hosting a crypto exchange at Nasdaq so</text>
  <text start="1403.01" dur="5.35">there&amp;#39;s more good news than I could</text>

  <text start="1426.5" dur="5.19">start and if you really want I mean if</text>
  <text start="1430.25" dur="2.85">you go into these crypto channels</text>
  <text start="1431.69" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s so much excitement there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1433.1" dur="3.72">really that many subscribers some of the</text>
  <text start="1435.14" dur="4.529">biggest crypto guys have less viewers</text>
  <text start="1436.82" dur="4.859">than I even have doing news because</text>
  <text start="1439.669" dur="4.411">there&amp;#39;s so few people that are this on</text>
  <text start="1441.679" dur="4.201">the edge cutting technology and those</text>
  <text start="1444.08" dur="3.36">are going to be the people that that</text>
  <text start="1445.88" dur="5.76">honestly do make the biggest returns</text>
  <text start="1447.44" dur="5.82">because they got there first and there</text>
  <text start="1451.64" dur="3.09">are some other videos I wanted to</text>
  <text start="1453.26" dur="2.84">suggest I&amp;#39;ll include the links in the</text>
  <text start="1454.73" dur="3.809">description but one of them is called</text>
  <text start="1456.1" dur="4.39">crypto currencies are the most important</text>
  <text start="1458.539" dur="4.221">technological advance since the internet</text>
  <text start="1460.49" dur="4.95">and that&amp;#39;s from the dollar vigilante and</text>

  <text start="1471.669" dur="3.911">there&amp;#39;s just a ton of excitement I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1474.14" dur="3.269">learning a lot of stuff about Kryptos</text>
  <text start="1475.58" dur="4.65">lately I really am excited about that</text>
  <text start="1477.409" dur="6.541">scene and I know people have been asking</text>
  <text start="1480.23" dur="7.29">for video I could possibly make a video</text>
  <text start="1483.95" dur="5.88">of purchasing the way I do it but there</text>
  <text start="1487.52" dur="4.71">are different ways of buying so you know</text>
  <text start="1489.83" dur="4.349">you can do bank wires you can do you can</text>
  <text start="1492.23" dur="5.88">do cash like like the wood with gold and</text>

  <text start="1498.11" dur="4.949">from Columbia through Western Union</text>
  <text start="1499.669" dur="5.87">because the best prices are there when I</text>

  <text start="1505.539" dur="5.981">has an e it&amp;#39;s kind of an escrow system</text>
