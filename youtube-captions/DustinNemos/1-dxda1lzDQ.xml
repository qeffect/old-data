  <text start="7.97" dur="4.53">hi guys welcome back this is testing</text>
  <text start="10.79" dur="3.42">with the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="12.5" dur="3.27">not subscribed yet please go ahead and</text>
  <text start="14.21" dur="4.38">subscribe hit the little bell so you</text>
  <text start="15.77" dur="5.82">always know when new things pop up today</text>
  <text start="18.59" dur="4.56">is Thursday August 1st 2019 and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="21.59" dur="3.27">briefly gonna run down some of these</text>
  <text start="23.15" dur="5.49">highlights from last night&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="24.86" dur="6.12">presidential debate so right out of the</text>
  <text start="28.64" dur="4.079">gate one of the more notable folks who</text>
  <text start="30.98" dur="4.77">had an opening statement that was rather</text>
  <text start="32.719" dur="6.121">short but received the largest applause</text>
  <text start="35.75" dur="5.609">was Andrew yang and he had proclaimed</text>
  <text start="38.84" dur="5.46">that if he was president then every</text>
  <text start="41.359" dur="5.46">single American would receive $1,000 per</text>
  <text start="44.3" dur="5.579">month in basic income so of course</text>
  <text start="46.819" dur="4.981">anytime you dangle free stuff in front</text>
  <text start="49.879" dur="3.511">of most people then they&amp;#39;re likely going</text>
  <text start="51.8" dur="3.929">to lunch for it and this was no</text>
  <text start="53.39" dur="5.689">exception so later on in the night he</text>
  <text start="55.729" dur="6.27">further explained that this would cost</text>
  <text start="59.079" dur="6.97">four hundred and sixty million dollars</text>
  <text start="61.999" dur="7.501">per month in Detroit alone that is a lot</text>
  <text start="66.049" dur="5.761">of money think about that one city just</text>
  <text start="69.5" dur="4.26">one out of the entire United States is</text>
  <text start="71.81" dur="3.99">going to cost the government actually</text>
  <text start="73.76" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s going to cost us because the</text>
  <text start="75.8" dur="5.22">government likes to tax us so that they</text>
  <text start="77.57" dur="5.76">can pay their bills well for one city</text>
  <text start="81.02" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s going to cost four hundred and</text>
  <text start="83.33" dur="6.24">sixty million dollars imagine how much</text>
  <text start="87.26" dur="4.98">is going to cost for every single city</text>
  <text start="89.57" dur="5.1">in this entire country and of course in</text>
  <text start="92.24" dur="3.96">the beginning he had said that the</text>
  <text start="94.67" dur="2.94">country needed someone who could do</text>
  <text start="96.2" dur="3.6">Asian math in order to make this</text>
  <text start="97.61" dur="5.79">possible well you must be talking about</text>
  <text start="99.8" dur="5.55">magic math because it doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="103.4" dur="3.87">sense it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like this country</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="5.34">will be able to afford that whatsoever</text>
  <text start="107.27" dur="6.63">not to mention the fact that if you</text>
  <text start="110.69" dur="4.98">provide a basic income to the tune of a</text>
  <text start="113.9" dur="6.15">thousand dollars per month there will be</text>
  <text start="115.67" dur="6.12">a significant portion of folks who</text>
  <text start="120.05" dur="3.42">decide that they don&amp;#39;t need to go out</text>
  <text start="121.79" dur="3.81">and work that they could just stay at</text>
  <text start="123.47" dur="4.439">home and collect their basic income</text>
  <text start="125.6" dur="6.3">alongside their welfare and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="127.909" dur="6.36">happy it will decrease productivity of</text>
  <text start="131.9" dur="5.73">this country and it will increase our</text>
  <text start="134.269" dur="6.151">debt it will definitely increase our</text>
  <text start="137.63" dur="3.81">taxes so this is not a good plan</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="2.88">whatsoever but</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="4.05">of course everybody was foaming at the</text>
  <text start="143.3" dur="6">mouth and cheering and applauding over</text>
  <text start="145.49" dur="6.69">this idea also coming out of the gate</text>
  <text start="149.3" dur="6.45">was de Blasio so bill de blasio me of</text>
  <text start="152.18" dur="8.31">New York he had said that he brings a</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="6.87">message of hope and he said quote we can</text>
  <text start="160.49" dur="4.89">bring change end quote</text>
  <text start="162.62" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s really reminiscent of Obama and</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="5.25">we certainly don&amp;#39;t want an Obama to</text>
  <text start="168.5" dur="4.38">point out which is another reason why</text>
  <text start="170.63" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s likely that Biden will not stand a</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="5.28">chance against Trump because the people</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="5.82">who voted for Trump certainly don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="178.16" dur="5.79">another Obama now of course when it</text>
  <text start="181.61" dur="4.92">comes to health care Kamala Harris she</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="5.34">has a plan that she wants to roll out</text>
  <text start="186.53" dur="5.43">over a period of ten years now this is</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="4.59">this it&amp;#39;s a very similar plan to Bernie</text>
  <text start="191.96" dur="4.77">Sanders where it&amp;#39;s Medicare for all</text>
  <text start="193.88" dur="4.68">now of course during the rollout private</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="4.35">insurance will also be available as long</text>
  <text start="198.56" dur="5.13">as they play by the rules of course she</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="5.73">didn&amp;#39;t say what those rules would be now</text>
  <text start="203.69" dur="5.1">Biden did call her out on this and said</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="3.69">that the American people certainly don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="4.68">want anyone who&amp;#39;s going to go every</text>
  <text start="210.5" dur="5.67">which way I will have to agree with him</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="4.5">on that fact because I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="216.17" dur="4.08">someone who&amp;#39;s going to flip-flop and</text>
  <text start="217.97" dur="4.26">most Americans don&amp;#39;t want someone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.25" dur="3.63">going to flip-flop we want someone with</text>
  <text start="222.23" dur="5.85">principles have to have your own</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="6.75">principles and so with her she wants to</text>
  <text start="228.08" dur="4.83">double dip so she has one foot in the</text>
  <text start="230.63" dur="4.44">water and one foot out she says she</text>
  <text start="232.91" dur="4.109">wants Medicare for all but at the same</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="4.38">time she says that she will allow</text>
  <text start="237.019" dur="6.241">private insurance to carry on during</text>
  <text start="239.45" dur="6.12">those ten years now Cory Booker also had</text>
  <text start="243.26" dur="5.82">a very wishy-washy position on health</text>
  <text start="245.57" dur="5.91">care he wants Medicare for all but at</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="4.74">the same time he also supports private</text>
  <text start="251.48" dur="4.14">insurance well which one is it Cory</text>
  <text start="253.82" dur="4.08">Booker you can&amp;#39;t have it both ways</text>
  <text start="255.62" dur="5.25">well the moderator had asked him to</text>
  <text start="257.9" dur="4.83">clarify on his position and yet he</text>
  <text start="260.87" dur="4.62">continued to dodge the question and</text>
  <text start="262.73" dur="4.71">never really answered it instead he</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="3.81">talked about how the Republicans and</text>
  <text start="267.44" dur="4.02">President Trump were likely very happy</text>
  <text start="269.3" dur="4.59">because of how divided they were on the</text>
  <text start="271.46" dur="3.47">stage about how they were fighting</text>
  <text start="273.89" dur="4.76">amongst them</text>
  <text start="274.93" dur="7.29">well Cory Booker this is a race this is</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="5.7">a race for the presidency you will have</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="4.41">to differentiate yourself at some point</text>
  <text start="284.35" dur="6.15">so yes you are going to be somewhat</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="5.46">divided and there can be only one well</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="3.15">first of all let me just say that the</text>
  <text start="292.09" dur="3.54">person is enjoying this debate most</text>
  <text start="293.65" dur="3.9">right now is Donald Trump as we picked</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="5.49">Democrats against each other while he is</text>
  <text start="297.55" dur="5.19">working right now to take away American</text>
  <text start="301.12" dur="3.51">health care there is a court case</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="3.62">working through the system that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="304.63" dur="4.11">to gut the Affordable Care Act and</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.87">actually gut protections on pre-existing</text>
  <text start="308.74" dur="3.9">conditions and so I was raised by two</text>
  <text start="311.23" dur="4.44">civil rights parents who told me to</text>
  <text start="312.64" dur="4.95">always keep your eyes on the prize and</text>
  <text start="315.67" dur="4.05">that is that in the United States of</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="4.56">America every Democrat should stand with</text>
  <text start="319.72" dur="4.26">the belief that everyone should have</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="4.86">access to health care that it&amp;#39;s a human</text>
  <text start="323.98" dur="6.42">right and how we get there it has to be</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="5.76">to end this broken system because we are</text>
  <text start="330.4" dur="5.28">on our way just a handful years of</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="5.79">literally spending 20% of our economy</text>
  <text start="335.68" dur="5.73">one out of every five dollars spent on</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="5.49">health care and we spend more than every</text>
  <text start="341.41" dur="4.95">other nation on everything from MRIs to</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="3.6">insulin drugs multiple mores in other</text>
  <text start="346.36" dur="2.91">countries multiple more than other</text>
  <text start="347.65" dur="3.66">countries and so you want to know what</text>
  <text start="349.27" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m gonna do I&amp;#39;m going to work to get us</text>
  <text start="351.31" dur="4.35">to a point where Medicare for all where</text>
  <text start="353.29" dur="4.65">everyone is covered but this pitting</text>
  <text start="355.66" dur="3.9">against progressives against modern</text>
  <text start="357.94" dur="3.48">saying one is unrealistic and the other</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="4.02">doesn&amp;#39;t care enough that to me is</text>
  <text start="361.42" dur="6.05">dividing our party and demoralizing us</text>
  <text start="363.58" dur="3.89">in face of the real enemy here</text>
  <text start="368.33" dur="7.44">now on immigration most had talked about</text>
  <text start="372.349" dur="5.401">of course the children in cages and how</text>
  <text start="375.77" dur="4.47">President Trump loves to throw women and</text>
  <text start="377.75" dur="4.259">children in jail and really that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="5.94">only reason why he continues to</text>
  <text start="382.009" dur="6.331">criminalize crossing the border never</text>
  <text start="386.18" dur="4.29">mind the fact that crossing illegally is</text>
  <text start="388.34" dur="4.829">a crime but of course most of them had</text>
  <text start="390.47" dur="4.62">said that they wanted to make crossing</text>
  <text start="393.169" dur="3.72">the border illegally into a civil</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="3.93">infraction which of course when you</text>
  <text start="396.889" dur="4.051">really think about it it just brings</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="6.299">back the catch and release</text>
  <text start="400.94" dur="6.779">because if someone has a civil</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="5.22">infraction you do not go to jail for</text>
  <text start="407.719" dur="4.681">that you get a ticket and you go home</text>
  <text start="410.539" dur="3.511">where are they going to go home to oh</text>
  <text start="412.4" dur="4.319">let&amp;#39;s just let them free into the</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="5.28">country and of course they likely won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="416.719" dur="8.551">show up for court which is what happened</text>
  <text start="419.33" dur="10.38">a lot when we had catch and release so</text>
  <text start="425.27" dur="9.119">that is why we cannot have crossing the</text>
  <text start="429.71" dur="10.98">border be classified as a civil</text>
  <text start="434.389" dur="8.52">infraction it has to be classified as a</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="3.599">crime because that&amp;#39;s what it is if</text>
  <text start="442.909" dur="5.431">you&amp;#39;re crossing illegally it&amp;#39;s a crime</text>
  <text start="444.289" dur="7.731">if you want to claim asylum then you</text>
  <text start="448.34" dur="6.78">need to go to the ports of entry that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="4.989">how the process is supposed to go you</text>
  <text start="455.12" dur="5.759">want to claim asylum go to the ports of</text>
  <text start="457.009" dur="6.931">entry otherwise if you cross illegally</text>
  <text start="460.879" dur="6.03">then you are going to be detained and</text>
  <text start="463.94" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re going to be deported but most of</text>
  <text start="466.909" dur="5.82">the people on this stage apparently</text>
  <text start="469.94" dur="5.039">think that it&amp;#39;s okay to cross the border</text>
  <text start="472.729" dur="4.62">and you might as well just have open</text>
  <text start="474.979" dur="6.211">borders because that&amp;#39;s what implementing</text>
  <text start="477.349" dur="10.081">the civil infraction that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.19" dur="10.77">going to do also of note Inslee had said</text>
  <text start="487.43" dur="6.81">that he has done more for immigration</text>
  <text start="491.96" dur="6.66">because he stood against the Muslim ban</text>
  <text start="494.24" dur="7.019">I am so tired of hearing about the</text>
  <text start="498.62" dur="4.16">Muslim it there is no such thing as the</text>
  <text start="501.259" dur="4.801">Muslim ban</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="6.36">it is such a fear-mongering thing to</text>
  <text start="506.06" dur="5.82">call it because that&amp;#39;s not what it is</text>
  <text start="509.14" dur="7.779">everyone wants to call this a Muslim</text>
  <text start="511.88" dur="8.31">band because they want to say that it is</text>
  <text start="516.919" dur="9.291">discriminatory and it is hateful well</text>
  <text start="520.19" dur="9">really if you understand how widespread</text>
  <text start="526.21" dur="8.68">Muslims really are then you would know</text>
  <text start="529.19" dur="7.5">that if it were really a Muslim man it</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="4.83">would not be limited to seven countries</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="6.48">it&amp;#39;s about keeping terrorists out</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="8.73">it really has next to nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="543.17" dur="7.53">immigration but that is likely one of</text>
  <text start="548.45" dur="4.29">the more memorable things that Inslee</text>
  <text start="550.7" dur="3.21">had to say all night he is rather</text>
  <text start="552.74" dur="4.92">forgettable</text>
  <text start="553.91" dur="6.48">now Biden was asked by Bill DeBlasio</text>
  <text start="557.66" dur="6.33">about his immigration policies and</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="6.75">whether or not he agreed with what Obama</text>
  <text start="563.99" dur="5.25">was doing in terms of deportation now of</text>
  <text start="567.14" dur="5.16">course Beynon continued to dodge the</text>
  <text start="569.24" dur="5.13">question but in de Blasio&amp;#39;s one of his</text>
  <text start="572.3" dur="4.29">shining moments of the night one of the</text>
  <text start="574.37" dur="11.52">few he had actually continued to hammer</text>
  <text start="576.59" dur="11.46">Biden for an answer criminal penalty</text>
  <text start="585.89" dur="3.75">when it&amp;#39;s American reality and what we</text>
  <text start="588.05" dur="5.7">need is comprehensive immigration reform</text>
  <text start="589.64" dur="6.54">once and for all to fix it second Vice</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="4.05">President Biden I didn&amp;#39;t hear your</text>
  <text start="596.18" dur="3.42">response when the issue came up with all</text>
  <text start="597.8" dur="3.42">those deportations your vice president</text>
  <text start="599.6" dur="3.54">itíd States I didn&amp;#39;t hear whether you</text>
  <text start="601.22" dur="3.63">tried to stop them or not using your</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="3.51">power your influence in the White House</text>
  <text start="604.85" dur="2.76">did you think it was a good idea or do</text>
  <text start="606.65" dur="1.59">you think it was something that needed</text>
  <text start="607.61" dur="2.4">to be stopped</text>
  <text start="608.24" dur="3.39">mr. president came along and he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="610.01" dur="3.87">guy that came up with the idea the first</text>
  <text start="611.63" dur="5.85">time ever I&amp;#39;m dealing with the dreamers</text>
  <text start="613.88" dur="6.36">he put that in the law he talked about a</text>
  <text start="617.48" dur="4.53">comprehensive plan when she put on a lay</text>
  <text start="620.24" dur="3.72">before the Congress saying that we</text>
  <text start="622.01" dur="4.02">should find a pathway to citizenship for</text>
  <text start="623.96" dur="4.35">people but you see he simply should up</text>
  <text start="626.03" dur="4.38">the number of people that were able to</text>
  <text start="628.31" dur="4.05">bring into this country lastly he also</text>
  <text start="630.41" dur="4.32">pointed out that we should go to the</text>
  <text start="632.36" dur="3.21">source of the problem and fix it where</text>
  <text start="634.73" dur="3.18">people were maybe</text>
  <text start="635.57" dur="4.59">in the first place so he didn&amp;#39;t compare</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="5.06">him to Donald Trump I think is</text>
  <text start="640.16" dur="2.81">absolutely bizarre</text>
  <text start="644.68" dur="6.24">so of course Biden did not respond to</text>
  <text start="648.23" dur="5.37">the question at all and Stan he touted</text>
  <text start="650.92" dur="4.99">Obama&amp;#39;s immigration policies talking</text>
  <text start="653.6" dur="5.13">about the dreamers and about how they</text>
  <text start="655.91" dur="5.49">were going to give money to the Central</text>
  <text start="658.73" dur="5.91">Americans in order to solve the problem</text>
  <text start="661.4" dur="5.88">at the root of course we know that that</text>
  <text start="664.64" dur="4.86">did not work at all and of course that</text>
  <text start="667.28" dur="5.88">is why President Trump has cut off aid</text>
  <text start="669.5" dur="7.71">because it&amp;#39;s not working but regardless</text>
  <text start="673.16" dur="7.98">the question really was asking whether</text>
  <text start="677.21" dur="5.79">or not Biden had agreed even had an</text>
  <text start="681.14" dur="5.16">opinion as to whether or not he</text>
  <text start="683" dur="7.53">supported Obama&amp;#39;s policies for deporting</text>
  <text start="686.3" dur="6.24">those who crossed illegally and Biden</text>
  <text start="690.53" dur="3.45">could not even say whether or not he had</text>
  <text start="692.54" dur="4.38">an opinion one way or the other</text>
  <text start="693.98" dur="6.36">he completely dodged it now in terms of</text>
  <text start="696.92" dur="5.91">civil rights and criminal justice reform</text>
  <text start="700.34" dur="5.16">tulsi gabbard stole the stage for a</text>
  <text start="702.83" dur="5.46">little while when she really put Kamala</text>
  <text start="705.5" dur="6.54">Harris under the spotlight regarding her</text>

  <text start="724.82" dur="2.25">a racist</text>
  <text start="725.6" dur="3.42">what&amp;#39;s your response I want to bring the</text>
  <text start="727.07" dur="4.86">conversation back to the broken criminal</text>
  <text start="729.02" dur="5.16">justice system but is disproportionately</text>
  <text start="731.93" dur="4.31">negatively impacting black and brown</text>
  <text start="734.18" dur="4.35">people all across this country today</text>

  <text start="740.81" dur="4.14">be a prosecutor president but I&amp;#39;m deeply</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="4.8">concerned about this record there are</text>
  <text start="744.95" dur="4.17">too many examples to cite but she put</text>
  <text start="747.23" dur="4.11">over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana</text>
  <text start="749.12" dur="4.77">violations and laughed about it when she</text>

  <text start="773.78" dur="3.78">poor people in the worst kind of way</text>
  <text start="775.64" dur="5.19">Thank You congresswoman Kuster Harris</text>
  <text start="777.56" dur="5.67">your response and perhaps the most</text>
  <text start="780.83" dur="6.09">bizarre statements of the NIE actually</text>
  <text start="783.23" dur="6">came from Kirsten Gillibrand when she</text>
  <text start="786.92" dur="5.18">talked about white privilege and how</text>
  <text start="789.23" dur="5.46">that prevented people from getting shots</text>
  <text start="792.1" dur="5.59">so let&amp;#39;s take a listen to what she had</text>
  <text start="794.69" dur="5.07">to say I think as a white woman of</text>
  <text start="797.69" dur="3.99">privilege who is a US senator running</text>
  <text start="799.76" dur="4.44">for president United States it is also</text>
  <text start="801.68" dur="4.5">my responsibility to lift up those</text>
  <text start="804.2" dur="3.93">voices that aren&amp;#39;t being listened to and</text>
  <text start="806.18" dur="3.27">I can talk to those white women in the</text>
  <text start="808.13" dur="2.58">suburbs that voted for Trump and</text>
  <text start="809.45" dur="3.66">explained to them what white privilege</text>
  <text start="810.71" dur="4.38">actually is that when their son is</text>
  <text start="813.11" dur="4.05">walking down a street with a bag of M&amp;amp;Ms</text>
  <text start="815.09" dur="3.84">in his pocket wearing the hoodie his</text>
  <text start="817.16" dur="2.36">whiteness is what protects them from not</text>
  <text start="818.93" dur="5.51">being shot</text>
  <text start="819.52" dur="4.92">[Applause]</text>
  <text start="824.71" dur="5.59">has a car that breaks down and he knocks</text>
  <text start="827.99" dur="3.99">on someone&amp;#39;s door for help and the door</text>
  <text start="830.3" dur="3.27">opens and the help is given it&amp;#39;s his</text>
  <text start="831.98" dur="3.66">whiteness that protects them from being</text>
  <text start="833.57" dur="4.019">shot that is what white privilege in</text>
  <text start="835.64" dur="3.66">America is today and so my</text>
  <text start="837.589" dur="3.991">responsibilities to not only lift up</text>
  <text start="839.3" dur="4.56">those stories but explain to communities</text>
  <text start="841.58" dur="5.009">across America like I did in Youngstown</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="4.26">Ohio to a young mother that this is all</text>
  <text start="846.589" dur="3.241">of our responsibilities and that</text>
  <text start="848.12" dur="6.42">together we can make our community</text>
  <text start="849.83" dur="6.449">stronger we are being convinced or the</text>
  <text start="854.54" dur="5.609">at least they are trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="856.279" dur="6.361">that we should be ashamed for our</text>
  <text start="860.149" dur="6.121">whiteness that white people should be</text>
  <text start="862.64" dur="5.759">ashamed of being white and that we are</text>
  <text start="866.27" dur="4.2">unaware of our white privilege if you</text>
  <text start="868.399" dur="4.021">don&amp;#39;t say that you&amp;#39;re ashamed of being</text>
  <text start="870.47" dur="4.47">white if you don&amp;#39;t say that you owe</text>
  <text start="872.42" dur="5.46">everybody extra then you are totally</text>
  <text start="874.94" dur="6.6">completely unaware of your white</text>
  <text start="877.88" dur="7.92">privilege of course nowadays they call</text>
  <text start="881.54" dur="7.38">it unconscious bias where there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="885.8" dur="4.59">idea that even if you think you are not</text>
  <text start="888.92" dur="7.59">racist then that means you are</text>
  <text start="890.39" dur="9">definitely racist really trying to</text>
  <text start="896.51" dur="4.92">convince the masses that it is shameful</text>
  <text start="899.39" dur="5.37">to be white and that every single white</text>
  <text start="901.43" dur="4.349">person is racist and that we have some</text>
  <text start="904.76" dur="4.44">kind of privilege</text>
  <text start="905.779" dur="6">so Gillibrand says she&amp;#39;s going to go</text>
  <text start="909.2" dur="4.94">down to white women Trump supporters and</text>
  <text start="911.779" dur="5.611">tell them about their white privilege</text>
  <text start="914.14" dur="6.91">what about the white women who are on</text>
  <text start="917.39" dur="7.44">the streets what about the white women</text>
  <text start="921.05" dur="6.72">who are so poor that they cannot afford</text>
  <text start="924.83" dur="5.4">housing what about the white women who</text>
  <text start="927.77" dur="6.9">are forced into prostitution because</text>
  <text start="930.23" dur="8.04">they don&amp;#39;t have anything else what about</text>
  <text start="934.67" dur="7.95">those folks are you going to tell them</text>
  <text start="938.27" dur="6.11">about their white privilege because that</text>
  <text start="942.62" dur="5.94">doesn&amp;#39;t really sound privileged to me</text>
  <text start="944.38" dur="6.73">and I think it&amp;#39;s ignorant to assume that</text>
  <text start="948.56" dur="5.45">every single white person has privilege</text>
  <text start="951.11" dur="2.9">because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="955.29" dur="6.61">privilege really has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="958.39" dur="11.58">race anymore and it&amp;#39;s quite evident by</text>
  <text start="961.9" dur="10.53">how diverse even this pool really is the</text>
  <text start="969.97" dur="5.82">candidacy pool for president is so</text>
  <text start="972.43" dur="8.78">diverse right now that it really refutes</text>
  <text start="975.79" dur="5.42">the claim that there is white privilege</text>
  <text start="981.99" dur="5.02">black Americans Hispanic Americans</text>
  <text start="984.91" dur="4.59">Muslim Americans they have so much more</text>
  <text start="987.01" dur="4.62">opportunity now in the United States</text>
  <text start="989.5" dur="4.89">than they ever have before and the</text>
  <text start="991.63" dur="5.93">Democrats are continually trying to</text>
  <text start="994.39" dur="6.45">divide this country trying to convince</text>
  <text start="997.56" dur="5.65">minorities that they are oppressed why</text>
  <text start="1000.84" dur="4.41">because they need minorities to believe</text>
  <text start="1003.21" dur="5.75">that they are oppressed so that they can</text>
  <text start="1005.25" dur="10.59">depend on them it&amp;#39;s all about dependency</text>
  <text start="1008.96" dur="9.1">because dependency grants them power so</text>
  <text start="1015.84" dur="4.68">they want to create the illusion that</text>
  <text start="1018.06" dur="5.58">minorities are powerless and they want</text>
  <text start="1020.52" dur="6.929">to also at the same time really beat</text>
  <text start="1023.64" dur="6.179">down white Americans and make them think</text>
  <text start="1027.449" dur="4.26">that they are less and that if they</text>
  <text start="1029.819" dur="9.181">don&amp;#39;t think that they are less than they</text>
  <text start="1031.709" dur="10.411">are arrogant every single person in this</text>
  <text start="1039" dur="5.459">country has privilege because you live</text>
  <text start="1042.12" dur="6.27">in America there is the opportunity for</text>
  <text start="1044.459" dur="11.581">privilege we have more opportunity than</text>
  <text start="1048.39" dur="11.28">any other country in the world so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1056.04" dur="8.7">really tired of the continuing</text>
  <text start="1059.67" dur="11.22">perpetuation of this idea of oppression</text>
  <text start="1064.74" dur="9.93">and racial divide you&amp;#39;re creating the</text>
  <text start="1070.89" dur="6.78">racial divide it&amp;#39;s like when you have a</text>
  <text start="1074.67" dur="5.57">wound they talk about healing well you</text>
  <text start="1077.67" dur="5.22">don&amp;#39;t continue to scratch open the wound</text>
  <text start="1080.24" dur="4.81">because then you&amp;#39;re going to prevent the</text>
  <text start="1082.89" dur="4.06">healing we&amp;#39;ve already been healing but</text>
  <text start="1085.05" dur="8.83">yet you want to rip it open</text>
  <text start="1086.95" dur="10.56">day after day after day Gillibrand what</text>
  <text start="1093.88" dur="10.29">you said was more divisive than anything</text>
