  <text start="99.18" dur="6.99">it was really really nice because before</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="5.671">I had this rigorous thing that I had to</text>
  <text start="106.17" dur="6.089">do every day to make sure that my skin</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="7.549">stayed clear and now it&amp;#39;s a she&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="112.259" dur="7.381">so much easier to deal with because</text>
  <text start="116.299" dur="4.93">because I because I use it I changed</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="7.35">what I do a little bit with it because</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="10.081">what I do is I I added some fractionated</text>
  <text start="126.99" dur="6.35">coconut oil to make it more absorbable</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="6.8">and</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="7.43">I just added like some oils from like</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="4.89">doTERRA you know like some different</text>
  <text start="140.77" dur="6.07">healing things and you know something</text>
  <text start="143" dur="5.55">about yeah and then just yeah it makes</text>
  <text start="146.84" dur="3.51">it nice and I put a little in a little</text>
  <text start="148.55" dur="3.87">dropper and so I can just pull the</text>
  <text start="150.35" dur="4.71">dropper out put like four drops up my</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="7.319">hands and put on my face and I probably</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="7.74">do it you know every other day it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.739" dur="5.101">funny because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s cheaper than all</text>
  <text start="162.8" dur="3.93">those expensive products that I use oh</text>
  <text start="164.84" dur="3">yeah of course that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="166.73" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t want us know about these recipes</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="5.04">and such they work and you know in many</text>
  <text start="169.73" dur="4.259">cases and they&amp;#39;re much much less costly</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="5.88">and they don&amp;#39;t they can&amp;#39;t patent them</text>
  <text start="173.989" dur="8.391">and such yeah exactly and it&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="178.76" dur="7.65">because I mean the other products are</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="5.829">actually I know III want to do like a</text>
  <text start="186.41" dur="4.32">side-by-side comparison with like a</text>
  <text start="188.209" dur="4.381">proactive or something cuz this this you</text>
  <text start="190.73" dur="3.9">know research around see 60 is 86</text>
  <text start="192.59" dur="3.63">percent reduction in acne and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="194.63" dur="3.69">have any of those side effects and</text>
  <text start="196.22" dur="4.89">unhealthy things this is good for people</text>
  <text start="198.32" dur="4.56">so what it what an amazing life-changing</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="3.42">product they&amp;#39;ve been selling proactive</text>
  <text start="202.88" dur="2.37">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not even healthy since</text>
  <text start="204.53" dur="4.11">I was a kid</text>
  <text start="205.25" dur="7.019">yeah well the original reason why I got</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="8.25">the C 60 was cuz I was like okay I need</text>
  <text start="212.269" dur="7.021">to do something healthy for myself and I</text>
  <text start="216.89" dur="5.909">don&amp;#39;t have a ton of money to go just by</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="7.74">like all these really expensive products</text>
  <text start="222.799" dur="5.97">right now so like as expensive as C 60</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="4.769">is it was like actually the cheaper</text>
  <text start="228.769" dur="4.581">alternative he&amp;#39;s gonna get cheaper soon</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="5.491">I think the industry is catching up now</text>
  <text start="233.35" dur="6.669">right my prices the couple days ago</text>
  <text start="237.29" dur="4.44">actually yeah so was one of these things</text>
  <text start="240.019" dur="3.81">where I was like it was like the least I</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="8.9">could do right now you know what I mean</text>
  <text start="243.829" dur="6.801">so um I actually did start taking it and</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="8.53">whatever it&amp;#39;s doing I&amp;#39;ve been feeling</text>
  <text start="254.239" dur="7.74">good you know and so I&amp;#39;m you never know</text>
  <text start="260.18" dur="4.169">what it is sometimes but I have been</text>
  <text start="261.979" dur="4.16">feeling good so I just says it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="264.349" dur="6.44">the only thing I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="266.139" dur="6.96">now yeah wait people people hit note</text>
  <text start="270.789" dur="4.291">really this is one of those things where</text>
  <text start="273.099" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s the first thing I send people to</text>
  <text start="275.08" dur="4.41">because it&amp;#39;s the thing I feel like most</text>
  <text start="277.509" dur="3.9">likely they&amp;#39;re going to have like a</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="3.63">noticeable impact or something that they</text>
  <text start="281.409" dur="2.82">feel especially if they&amp;#39;re sick or</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="2.759">they&amp;#39;re having some kind of problem</text>
  <text start="284.229" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re dealing with they&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="285.879" dur="3.961">the the kind of impact where it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="287.919" dur="3.96">oh wow and I&amp;#39;m better a day or two later</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="3.539">you know I can&amp;#39;t make guarantees or</text>
  <text start="291.879" dur="3.66">anything like that but nothing else does</text>
  <text start="293.379" dur="7.56">that usually so this is the one thing I</text>
  <text start="295.539" dur="11.211">tell people to go to first you said it</text>
  <text start="300.939" dur="10.651">was world&amp;#39;s best antioxidant yeah</text>

  <text start="503.29" dur="4.08">store you know you can even eat the</text>
  <text start="506.02" dur="2.94">powder if you wanted to although it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="3.99">probably pretty gross people tend to do</text>
  <text start="508.96" dur="4.41">it with a water mixture but you can buy</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="4.109">the the cheap or on tablets it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="4.169">expensive at all and this you know I</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="4.62">refer people back to dr. noon ham and</text>
  <text start="517.539" dur="4.771">this is way back decades ago but he was</text>
  <text start="520.089" dur="4.051">in Australia and he was getting you know</text>
  <text start="522.31" dur="4.11">tens of thousands of customers he was</text>
  <text start="524.14" dur="5.16">doing some serious good for the world</text>
  <text start="526.42" dur="4.77">especially in the areas of bone you know</text>
  <text start="529.3" dur="3.24">hip fracture arthritis you know that</text>
  <text start="531.19" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re all of the bone issues</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="3.209">he was preventing</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="4.019">especially older ladies and elder people</text>
  <text start="535.749" dur="3.96">from having these kind of broken you</text>
  <text start="537.819" dur="3.21">know falls and and we&amp;#39;re situations</text>
  <text start="539.709" dur="2.581">where they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re in a hospital for</text>
  <text start="541.029" dur="3.18">weeks because they&amp;#39;re recovering from</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="4.26">these broken you know terrible broken</text>
  <text start="544.209" dur="3.48">bones and such as air conditioners</text>
  <text start="546.55" dur="6.12">popping on in this RV here I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="547.689" dur="8.31">temporarily in an RV as I go so anyway</text>
  <text start="552.67" dur="5.759">kind of lost my train of thought but my</text>
  <text start="555.999" dur="4.921">point is that dr. noon ham was really</text>
  <text start="558.429" dur="3.96">achieving I can use the word miraculous</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="3.449">I&amp;#39;m always afraid of what words to use</text>
  <text start="562.389" dur="3.75">isn&amp;#39;t that crazy but he was achieving</text>
  <text start="564.369" dur="3.33">some interesting results well worth</text>
  <text start="566.139" dur="3.69">studying and I did a video breaking down</text>
  <text start="567.699" dur="3.36">some of the studies that he was he was</text>
  <text start="569.829" dur="3.271">doing in some of the research that he</text>
  <text start="571.059" dur="3.99">was getting out until he went to the</text>
  <text start="573.1" dur="3.419">pharmaceutical companies to get help</text>
  <text start="575.049" dur="3.66">marketing it because he had too many</text>
  <text start="576.519" dur="4.891">people wanting to buy his product then</text>
  <text start="578.709" dur="3.41">they shut him down of course that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="581.41" dur="5.099">it works</text>
  <text start="582.119" dur="9.45">yeah one of those yeah quad sorry and</text>
  <text start="586.509" dur="5.06">that&amp;#39;s why I actually make my own little</text>
  <text start="598.259" dur="4.69">take it how did you get over the like</text>
  <text start="600.879" dur="3.39">the fear of everyone has like that&amp;#39;s rap</text>

  <text start="610.36" dur="5.43">that makes you not want to take it</text>
  <text start="612.339" dur="7.5">everybody&amp;#39;s so afraid but when I read</text>
  <text start="615.79" dur="7.95">the actual real data about it that it is</text>
  <text start="619.839" dur="9.5">not poisonous that you can OD on table</text>
  <text start="623.74" dur="9.36">salt before you OD on yeah come like I</text>

  <text start="636.79" dur="3.269">and heavy metals those two mines where</text>

  <text start="656.049" dur="7.65">first time I did try it it was a little</text>
  <text start="659.709" dur="5.621">bit scary because what it was one of the</text>
  <text start="663.699" dur="5.291">things that it does is it kills</text>
  <text start="665.33" dur="6.81">Dida and so we hate going there you have</text>

  <text start="677.26" dur="7.509">tired and sluggish and kind of down for</text>
  <text start="681.5" dur="7.23">the first day I think I think it lasted</text>
  <text start="684.769" dur="5.551">about a day or so and then and then it</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="3.63">went away and then I never had it again</text>
  <text start="690.32" dur="3.48">well you know it&amp;#39;s interesting you say</text>
  <text start="692.36" dur="3">that because noon ham was getting</text>
  <text start="693.8" dur="3.75">results where he had people who had</text>
  <text start="695.36" dur="3.93">actual pain for a couple weeks before</text>
  <text start="697.55" dur="2.88">before they got better I mean he was</text>
  <text start="699.29" dur="3.45">dealing with some serious you know</text>
  <text start="700.43" dur="4.5">issues especially like elder cases and</text>
  <text start="702.74" dur="4.589">such but they actually would have some</text>
  <text start="704.93" dur="4.32">pain in the point in the bone area where</text>
  <text start="707.329" dur="4.141">they were having the good effect and</text>
  <text start="709.25" dur="4.29">then afterwards it was it was a it was</text>
  <text start="711.47" dur="4.44">amazing so there was actually a little</text>
  <text start="713.54" dur="5.43">bit of a pain reaction that went with</text>
  <text start="715.91" dur="4.83">this process for the freshmen and it has</text>
  <text start="718.97" dur="3.84">a great you know sort of herxheimer</text>
  <text start="720.74" dur="4.92">reaction that&amp;#39;s one of those there&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="722.81" dur="4.68">dogs it&amp;#39;s one of those things where you</text>
  <text start="725.66" dur="3.6">can have it if you take too much and you</text>
  <text start="727.49" dur="3.63">maybe start from a bad health position</text>
  <text start="729.26" dur="4.68">like standard Americans diet or the sad</text>
  <text start="731.12" dur="5.76">diet hey puppies then you could have a</text>
  <text start="733.94" dur="4.709">herxheimer or healing crisis and you</text>
  <text start="736.88" dur="3.3">know that&amp;#39;s basically you go from eating</text>
  <text start="738.649" dur="3.271">fast food all the time to juicing three</text>
  <text start="740.18" dur="4.38">times a day you&amp;#39;re probably gonna get a</text>
  <text start="741.92" dur="7.289">favor and throw up at best so you know</text>
  <text start="744.56" dur="6.93">if you start trying to this is life</text>
  <text start="749.209" dur="5.341">right like you don&amp;#39;t get CNN but at</text>
  <text start="751.49" dur="5.9">least you get the truth okay million</text>
  <text start="754.55" dur="6.69">dollar Studios ahead okay anyway so</text>
  <text start="757.39" dur="7">where was I as far as the herxheimer</text>
  <text start="761.24" dur="6.81">reactions so certain things like iodine</text>
  <text start="764.39" dur="6.63">like like boron borax I like just mass</text>
  <text start="768.05" dur="5.67">juicing if you do it too fast too hard</text>
  <text start="771.02" dur="4.59">from - too slow of a start or - and</text>
  <text start="773.72" dur="4.26">healthy of a position you&amp;#39;re gonna get</text>
  <text start="775.61" dur="4.11">sick and in some places you know or in</text>
  <text start="777.98" dur="3.63">some cases like with heavy metals if</text>
  <text start="779.72" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;re chelating heavy metals out it can</text>
  <text start="781.61" dur="4.14">even hurt you you&amp;#39;re hurt your organs if</text>
  <text start="783.89" dur="5.97">you&amp;#39;re doing it too fast so there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="785.75" dur="6.66">these precautions to take but low key</text>
  <text start="789.86" dur="5.16">like this you know boron it has so many</text>
  <text start="792.41" dur="5.22">uses including detoxing the pineal gland</text>
  <text start="795.02" dur="4.14">and third eye that I think it&amp;#39;s involved</text>
  <text start="797.63" dur="4.019">in over 200 functions bodily</text>
  <text start="799.16" dur="6.799">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good for the cognitive it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="801.649" dur="7.43">good for the forebrain it&amp;#39;s good for</text>
  <text start="805.959" dur="9.43">Alzheimer&amp;#39;s and dementia kind of</text>
  <text start="809.079" dur="8.95">patients it&amp;#39;s good for I don&amp;#39;t I think</text>
  <text start="815.389" dur="4.44">it may have had a link to IQ but I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="818.029" dur="4.021">100% sure on that one I know iodine did</text>
  <text start="819.829" dur="4.88">so you know it&amp;#39;s strong in many areas</text>
  <text start="822.05" dur="6.93">all across the board but it&amp;#39;s known for</text>
  <text start="824.709" dur="8.32">kind of bone strength teeth strength and</text>
  <text start="828.98" dur="6.779">that sort of thing yeah as well as how</text>
  <text start="833.029" dur="3.571">good it is with yeast I mean oh my god</text>
  <text start="835.759" dur="2.37">yeah</text>
  <text start="836.6" dur="3.81">the candida thing is a big deal for</text>
  <text start="838.129" dur="3.841">people it is a big deal because who</text>
  <text start="840.41" dur="3.779">doesn&amp;#39;t have it everybody&amp;#39;s guy</text>
  <text start="841.97" dur="5.219">everybody&amp;#39;s got that I can&amp;#39;t eat it and</text>
  <text start="844.189" dur="8.041">and and it&amp;#39;s interesting because it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="847.189" dur="8.731">it it&amp;#39;s helps with viruses to know and</text>
  <text start="852.23" dur="7.32">I&amp;#39;ve noticed I&amp;#39;ve noticed like if I have</text>
  <text start="855.92" dur="5.669">like a little coleslaw or something how</text>
  <text start="859.55" dur="3.75">much how much do you take if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="861.589" dur="10.791">mind me asking you know stood out like a</text>
  <text start="863.3" dur="12">milligram a day or pill sized gel cap</text>
  <text start="872.38" dur="4.48">the boron if you&amp;#39;re taking the the borax</text>
  <text start="875.3" dur="3.75">then it&amp;#39;s only like 10 or something</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="4.86">percent or less moron</text>
  <text start="879.05" dur="5.25">oh is it not that it will hurt you what</text>
  <text start="881.72" dur="4.59">the rest of it is but the actual like</text>
  <text start="884.3" dur="4.05">active boron which is a good form it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="886.31" dur="4.35">highly absorbable form of boron it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="888.35" dur="3.51">a problem but you know you have to kind</text>
  <text start="890.66" dur="3.539">of measure that when you&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="891.86" dur="4.079">dosing I know that there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="894.199" dur="4.021">different popular recipes the one I went</text>
  <text start="895.939" dur="4.38">with was called the Ted&amp;#39;s recipe and it</text>
  <text start="898.22" dur="4.2">was it was pretty heavy dose like four</text>
  <text start="900.319" dur="4.681">or five days on per week and has brakes</text>
  <text start="902.42" dur="4.409">built in but even on like a you know</text>
  <text start="905" dur="3.48">sort of a daily if I recall I would</text>
  <text start="906.829" dur="3.93">check my graph to remember for sure but</text>
  <text start="908.48" dur="4.979">I did a video on it but it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="910.759" dur="5.281">twenty milligrams a day it was where</text>
  <text start="913.459" dur="4.591">noon ham had people getting some pretty</text>
  <text start="916.04" dur="6.029">amazing results and he went up I think</text>
  <text start="918.05" dur="7.019">to 150 for some people per day but even</text>
  <text start="922.069" dur="5.431">just 20 you start to see all of the</text>
  <text start="925.069" dur="4.02">problems where there&amp;#39;s deficiencies</text>
  <text start="927.5" dur="3.42">where they don&amp;#39;t have enough they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="929.089" dur="3.541">have any those problems just sort of go</text>
  <text start="930.92" dur="5.34">away fast</text>
  <text start="932.63" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s true it&amp;#39;s true like I&amp;#39;ve had times</text>
  <text start="936.26" dur="3.99">where I wasn&amp;#39;t taking it and then I</text>
  <text start="938.27" dur="3.78">would just have like I&amp;#39;d wake up in the</text>
  <text start="940.25" dur="4.59">morning and my joints were a little sore</text>
  <text start="942.05" dur="5.07">and my fingers or whatever and so I&amp;#39;d be</text>

  <text start="954.95" dur="4.47">actually really really like it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="957.2" dur="4.2">take it on a daily basis like a vitamin</text>
  <text start="959.42" dur="4.68">but I kind of take it as I need it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="961.4" dur="5.76">like okay this is going on that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="964.1" dur="5.1">on and I&amp;#39;ll just take some but I</text>
