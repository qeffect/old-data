  <text start="3.87" dur="6.269">of destiny most calm and Athena&amp;#39;s with</text>
  <text start="6.48" dur="6.5">me this morning Mama&amp;#39;s not up yet we</text>
  <text start="10.139" dur="5.011">always get our mourning time together so</text>
  <text start="12.98" dur="4.03">for those who have been following lately</text>
  <text start="15.15" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;ve been you know in addition to my</text>
  <text start="17.01" dur="4.65">usual political and human stuff</text>
  <text start="18.99" dur="5.07">I sometimes I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll jump down a rabbit</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="4.08">hole I recently jumped down some of the</text>
  <text start="24.06" dur="2.91">David Wilcock rabbit holes and I started</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="3.72">watching some of his videos which I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="26.97" dur="3.36">never really watched before honestly I</text>
  <text start="29.46" dur="2.58">always thought he&amp;#39;s one of those crazy</text>
  <text start="30.33" dur="3.36">conspiracy theorists about aliens and</text>
  <text start="32.04" dur="3.66">reptilians and all that stuff and I said</text>
  <text start="33.69" dur="3.69">maybe he is I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;ve only seen</text>
  <text start="35.7" dur="5.06">a few of his things so far but his</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="5.73">knowledge of ancient civilizations and</text>
  <text start="40.76" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s very impressive I like it so far</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="5.37">I&amp;#39;m actually impressed by David Wilcock</text>
  <text start="45" dur="4.89">I never thought I would say that I was I</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="6.36">was going through some of the stuff he</text>
  <text start="49.89" dur="6.45">was he was talking about there is this</text>
  <text start="54.84" dur="3.059">interesting alternate theory it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="56.34" dur="3.359">fascinating it really is and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="4.561">know if still morning it&amp;#39;s some kind of</text>
  <text start="59.699" dur="4.5">like allergies and stuff yet I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="62.46" dur="5.49">taken anything yet so I might be like</text>
  <text start="64.199" dur="5.071">blinking and scratching a lot sorry but</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="2.91">this book I wanted to make a video about</text>
  <text start="69.27" dur="3.06">it because some of the stuff that he</text>
  <text start="70.86" dur="3.36">points out it&amp;#39;s really fascinating he</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="5.28">goes through kind of an alternate</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="6.149">history of the elite from sort of a</text>
  <text start="77.61" dur="4.68">biblical and yet not religious</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="5.57">perspective like the Bible is sort of a</text>
  <text start="82.29" dur="7.969">story of the</text>
  <text start="85.939" dur="7.901">not of demons but of aliens kind of or</text>
  <text start="90.259" dur="9.011">or possibly both I don&amp;#39;t know but the</text>
  <text start="93.84" dur="6.989">idea is that the elite the modern elite</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="4.59">who are engaged in all the evil stuff</text>
  <text start="100.829" dur="4.68">like the pet of Oran and the the occult</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="3.929">ritual ISM that the sacrifice the</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="4.551">drinking of blood to drain a chrome of</text>
  <text start="107.789" dur="8.421">eating a flesh of humans</text>
  <text start="110.06" dur="11.169">you know the elitism the the higher IQ</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="7.99">these things these people believe</text>
  <text start="121.229" dur="6.09">themselves quite quite literally to be</text>
  <text start="124.2" dur="5.789">the descendants of the Fallen Angels</text>
  <text start="127.319" dur="6.121">okay at least some of the elites seem to</text>
  <text start="129.989" dur="5.071">do so and this is this is not just David</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="5.609">Wilcock this is stuff I&amp;#39;ve been coming</text>
  <text start="135.06" dur="6.09">kind of to that perspective for quite a</text>
  <text start="139.049" dur="4.171">while and David just sort of like he</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="5.13">kind of gives me that last nudge to get</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="4.799">over to that line so if the elite you</text>
  <text start="146.28" dur="3.87">know if you believe in the Bible or</text>
  <text start="148.019" dur="4.951">don&amp;#39;t believe in the Bible okay</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="5.49">it shouldn&amp;#39;t matter because they believe</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="8.28">in this and if they legitimately believe</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="8.46">themselves to be the outcasts and Damned</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="6.45">and attacked offspring of the Nephilim</text>
  <text start="164.1" dur="5.16">which are the children of the grigory</text>
  <text start="167.7" dur="6.42">and the Watchers which were the Angels</text>
  <text start="169.26" dur="6.9">that God sent to monitor earth when man</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="3.81">was first put on the planet and then</text>
  <text start="176.16" dur="3.03">they became tempted by the women and the</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="3.36">daughters of men and they started having</text>
  <text start="179.19" dur="4.079">tons of babies and these babies were</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="3.72">called the Giants or the Nephilim or the</text>
  <text start="183.269" dur="4.171">man of great renown and heroes and and</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="5.099">they also were like cam ballistic evil</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="3.06">Giants so they were tearing up the</text>
  <text start="190.109" dur="3.6">planet</text>
  <text start="190.5" dur="5.22">supposedly before the flood okay and</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="4.291">then the flood wiped a lot of them out</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="4.28">but some of them survived and K you know</text>
  <text start="198" dur="5.609">underground and some of these larger</text>
  <text start="200" dur="6.97">cavern systems allegedly this stuff is</text>
  <text start="203.609" dur="6.421">crazy right and then they continued to</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="5.13">procreate with man you have all of this</text>
  <text start="210.03" dur="5.1">evil occultism throughout history is not</text>
  <text start="212.1" dur="4.99">just modern-day stuff they have if child</text>
  <text start="215.13" dur="3.639">sacrifice some</text>
  <text start="217.09" dur="3.27">our sort of rituals throughout the</text>
  <text start="218.769" dur="2.731">ancient world and places that have no</text>
  <text start="220.36" dur="2.989">connection to each other there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="221.5" dur="4.65">of weird questions that that brings up</text>
  <text start="223.349" dur="4.511">like they were connected or maybe these</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="4.339">civilizations were multiple places and</text>
  <text start="227.86" dur="6.47">then wiped out or went underground</text>
  <text start="230.489" dur="6.461">but the idea if they believe that is</text>
  <text start="234.33" dur="4.57">that they are the descendants of the</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="4.44">half God angels basically and that that</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="5.79">makes them special and that would of</text>
  <text start="241.39" dur="4.8">course explain some of the cannibalistic</text>
  <text start="244.69" dur="3.99">tendencies in the eating of flesh and</text>
  <text start="246.19" dur="4.409">blood and things of that nature and just</text>
  <text start="248.68" dur="4.86">sort of the general evil and lack of</text>
  <text start="250.599" dur="6.181">care that they have for us some mortals</text>
  <text start="253.54" dur="5.189">such normal humans it would explain the</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="3.63">link between some of the elongated</text>
  <text start="258.729" dur="4.141">skulls that we have you know seen</text>
  <text start="260.41" dur="5.7">throughout history where those were sort</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="5.78">of humans but bigger brains bigger Souls</text>
  <text start="266.11" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s weird sort of bread and ALP maybe</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="5.489">if the theory is correct and you know</text>
  <text start="271.36" dur="5.52">the giant Nephilim blood is pretty damn</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="5.141">weak at this point and they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="276.88" dur="4.14">just humans with high IQ they&amp;#39;ve lost</text>
  <text start="279.28" dur="4.02">the elongated skulls they&amp;#39;ve lost the</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="5.54">gigantic stature and kind of getting</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="5.88">inbred at this point in my opinion but</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="4.78">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s highly highly highly</text>
  <text start="289.18" dur="5.22">interesting and it even talks about kind</text>
  <text start="291.34" dur="9.11">of what happened to what you would know</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="8.55">as Satan or really Satan ell or the</text>
  <text start="300.45" dur="4.779">adversary kind of more of a title than a</text>
  <text start="302.95" dur="4.91">person and in fact according to this</text>
  <text start="305.229" dur="5.25">book The Book of Enoch Noah&amp;#39;s grandad</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.42">who supposedly lived in those days right</text>
  <text start="310.479" dur="4.291">like he was among these junkets and</text>
  <text start="312.28" dur="9.59">stuff he lived in those times before the</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="11.27">flood supposedly this guy is able to</text>
  <text start="321.87" dur="4.17">how do I put it - how I put it</text>
