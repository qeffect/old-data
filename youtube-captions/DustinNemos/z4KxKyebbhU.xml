  <text start="22.949" dur="4.891">invited Alex to break it down for us</text>
  <text start="24.9" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s worse than the original NAFTA it</text>
  <text start="27.84" dur="4.349">adds in some TPP and social engineering</text>
  <text start="30.51" dur="3.889">and even surrenders even more of our</text>
  <text start="32.189" dur="4.741">sovereignty than the previous NAFTA so</text>
  <text start="34.399" dur="3.881">let&amp;#39;s talk about this list IVA and Alex</text>

  <text start="52.379" dur="7.531">so NAFTA 2.0 or this us MCA us Mexico</text>
  <text start="57.03" dur="4.65">Canada trade agreement you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="59.91" dur="5.13">no way to sugarcoat this it is an</text>
  <text start="61.68" dur="5.91">absolute disaster and I think if you</text>
  <text start="65.04" dur="4.14">want to know you know how bad it is we</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="2.91">can just look at what the globalists are</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="3.03">saying there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s one particular</text>
  <text start="70.5" dur="2.88">global as his name is Richard Haass who</text>
  <text start="72.21" dur="4.14">runs the Council on Foreign Relations</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="5.76">which is like the premier deep state</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="4.71">globalist mouthpiece if you will at</text>
  <text start="79.14" dur="3.479">least in the United States and he</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="3.78">boasted on Twitter that hey this is like</text>
  <text start="82.619" dur="5.04">better than NAFTA it includes you know</text>
  <text start="84.84" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s NAFTA plus TPP plus 10 or 20</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="3.871">percent we gotta pass it immediately so</text>
  <text start="90.03" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s how bad it is right it was of</text>
  <text start="91.53" dur="4.949">course negotiated by a guy named Robert</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="4.169">light Heiser Trump&amp;#39;s US Trade</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="3.18">Representative and this guy is also a</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="4.621">member of the Council on Foreign</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="5.64">Relations so he&amp;#39;s quite literally yeah I</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="5.549">mean it flies in the face of everything</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="5.191">that Trump has stood for from when he</text>
  <text start="108.899" dur="3.211">was campaigning you know any and even</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="3.03">what he said in speeches as president he</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="2.28">gave speech in Vietnam where he said</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;re not gonna do any more of these</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="4.95">multilateral trade deals anymore</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="3.54">it surrenders our sovereignty there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="3.84">reason to do that we&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.32">bilateral trade deals so it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="3.539">know exactly what he&amp;#39;s thinking but it</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="4.379">what is very clear and I haven&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="126.719" dur="3.751">the 1,800 pages either I doubt very very</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="3.151">many people in the world have read all</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="3.599">1,800 pages but what&amp;#39;s very clear is</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="3.809">that this takes NAFTA</text>
  <text start="134.069" dur="4.711">puts it on steroids incorporates big</text>
  <text start="136.079" dur="5.211">parts of the TPP and also adds a bunch</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="5.189">of craziness about you know gender and</text>
  <text start="141.29" dur="3.94">it actually enshrined a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="143.969" dur="3.75">UN agreements some of which we haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="4.94">even ratified into law for example the</text>
  <text start="147.719" dur="4.591">UN law of the sea treaty the UN</text>
  <text start="150.17" dur="4.33">international labor organization all</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="4.41">these international instruments it</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="4.53">treats them as if they were law as if</text>
  <text start="156.72" dur="3.81">they were ratified already in the text</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="3.75">and so even though our Senate has never</text>
  <text start="160.53" dur="4.379">consented to these you could say that</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="3.9">they would come at least quietly through</text>
  <text start="164.909" dur="3.48">the backdoor into American jurisprudence</text>
  <text start="166.68" dur="6.089">because it would be enshrined in this</text>
  <text start="168.389" dur="5.88">binding agreement now um you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="172.769" dur="4.291">yeah and there&amp;#39;s no way to sugarcoat</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="5.34">yeah I&amp;#39;m a Trump fan I very much like</text>
  <text start="177.06" dur="3.84">what Trump has said but on this issue</text>
  <text start="179.609" dur="3.6">you know unfortunately his</text>
  <text start="180.9" dur="4.5">administration is wrong and I&amp;#39;m hoping</text>
  <text start="183.209" dur="3.87">that there is some kind of trump card up</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="3.69">his sleeve he&amp;#39;s talked about withdrawing</text>
  <text start="187.079" dur="3.481">from NAFTA and blowing up the whole</text>
  <text start="189.09" dur="3.06">structure and then forcing them to vote</text>
  <text start="190.56" dur="3.959">on the u.s. MCA so maybe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.15" dur="4.89">something there but it is bad bad news</text>
  <text start="194.519" dur="4.921">well it shows you sort of how precarious</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="4.619">our position is in this war I mean we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.44" dur="5.669">still facing some pretty powerful bad</text>
  <text start="201.659" dur="6.271">guys if we have to take such risks as as</text>
  <text start="205.109" dur="4.62">allowing them to pass bad laws or get in</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="4.83">bad people in positions of power or take</text>
  <text start="209.729" dur="4.711">the house just in order to play for HS</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="3.809">moves in order for some potential</text>
  <text start="214.44" dur="5.129">benefit in the future so there&amp;#39;s a risk</text>
  <text start="216.569" dur="4.5">to that for sure and this is a scary</text>
  <text start="219.569" dur="3.211">thing to see maybe Trump wants it to</text>
  <text start="221.069" dur="4.081">just crash and burn maybe it&amp;#39;s an just</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="4.049">designed to implode once people find out</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="4.799">about what&amp;#39;s in it or something but he</text>
  <text start="226.829" dur="4.91">championed it he you know he he made it</text>
  <text start="229.949" dur="3.991">out to be a good thing this is a</text>
  <text start="231.739" dur="4.81">something that I&amp;#39;m concerned about for</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="4.169">sure yeah well and I think part of the</text>
  <text start="236.549" dur="3.87">problem is you know Trump comes from the</text>
  <text start="238.109" dur="4.921">business world so when one of his aides</text>
  <text start="240.419" dur="3.99">when one of his employees tells him hey</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="3.9">this is good you know I looked it over</text>
  <text start="244.409" dur="3.901">don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s all rock-solid you know</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="2.85">when you&amp;#39;re in the business world you</text>
  <text start="248.31" dur="2.669">can generally take that to the bank</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="2.4">because if someone&amp;#39;s lying to you</text>
  <text start="250.979" dur="2.611">they&amp;#39;re gonna lose their job right away</text>
  <text start="252.18" dur="2.82">I mean you know people just don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="253.59" dur="2.489">that kind of thing so much in business</text>
  <text start="255" dur="3.479">because there are real-world</text>
  <text start="256.079" dur="4.171">consequences whereas in government it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.479" dur="3.48">this whole other universe you know you</text>
  <text start="260.25" dur="3.84">cannot especially when you&amp;#39;re operating</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="4.351">in the swamp you cannot trust these</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="3.84">banks in order to get drunk yeah they</text>
  <text start="266.31" dur="3.24">like those predator</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="3.63">Plus videos they can&amp;#39;t fire me anywhere</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;m a federal employee I mean that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="4.65">attitude there that&amp;#39;s right and you know</text>
  <text start="273.9" dur="4.44">the the entire executive branch is</text>
  <text start="276.21" dur="3.929">completely infested with these people at</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="3.84">every level you know the the Hill broke</text>
  <text start="280.139" dur="4.381">down the contributions they found out</text>
  <text start="282.18" dur="4.5">that something like 96 percent of the</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="4.08">money that federal employees gave in the</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="3.42">2016 presidential campaign went to</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="2.61">Hillary Clinton so I tells you</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="2.49">everything you need to know Trump is</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="2.61">sitting on top of this bureaucracy of</text>
  <text start="292.59" dur="4.169">you know three million federal</text>
  <text start="293.82" dur="5.46">bureaucrats and they hate his guts they</text>
  <text start="296.759" dur="4.741">all support the Hillary agenda they</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="5.13">support globalism this or big government</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="4.08">you know I&amp;#39;m so happy to see the</text>
  <text start="304.41" dur="3.24">government shut down first</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="4.08">oh it&amp;#39;s brilliant it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="307.65" dur="3">brilliant the media exactly like the sky</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="2.91">is falling like hey you know</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="3.18">everything&amp;#39;s still pretty fine the world</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="5.129">in and saving money</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="6.36">theoretically not in practice it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.699" dur="5.881">so crazy that they that they can try to</text>
  <text start="320.19" dur="5.37">sell that but you know this um this u.s.</text>
  <text start="323.58" dur="3.42">MCA you know I I hope people will take</text>
  <text start="325.56" dur="2.82">the time we&amp;#39;ve got a lot of articles</text>
  <text start="327" dur="3.09">about it over at the new American</text>
  <text start="328.38" dur="3.75">exposing that some of the nuances you</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="4.77">have literally the enshrining of this</text>
  <text start="332.13" dur="4.71">you know gender ideology this stuff that</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="3.75">the Canadian government put in and you</text>
  <text start="336.84" dur="2.94">know there&amp;#39;s a few consolation prizes in</text>
  <text start="338.61" dur="2.79">there I&amp;#39;m sure that that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="339.78" dur="2.669">globalist who negotiate it told Trump</text>
  <text start="341.4" dur="3.06">like hey you know we&amp;#39;re gonna reduce</text>
  <text start="342.449" dur="3.511">tariffs a little bit on milk exports to</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="3.03">Canada so that would be good for dairy</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="3.6">farmers and you know you love the dairy</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="3.09">farmers they voted for you so so trunk</text>
  <text start="349.56" dur="3.99">thought oh well that&amp;#39;s good you know do</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="5.73">a favor for the dairy farmers but um the</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="5.04">risky donation you know yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.31" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s unconscionable what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="3.93">happened here and you know I know for a</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="3.539">fact Trump is not a globalist you know</text>
  <text start="362.52" dur="3.389">you if you listen to what he says if you</text>
  <text start="364.259" dur="3.541">look at his background</text>
  <text start="365.909" dur="4.171">now it&amp;#39;s Jones over at Infowars was just</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="4.649">talking about this a few days ago on his</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="4.44">program that trunk grew up reading</text>
  <text start="372.449" dur="4.171">material from like the Western goals</text>
  <text start="374.52" dur="3.81">foundation an operation set up by Larry</text>
  <text start="376.62" dur="3.06">McDonald congressman Larry McDonald the</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="2.88">president or the chairman of the John</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="4.799">Birch Society who was shot down by the</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="5.81">Soviet Union you know he knows all this</text>
  <text start="384.479" dur="5.131">stuff his dad knew all this stuff and</text>
  <text start="387.02" dur="4.81">Roy Cohn died she was deeply involved</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="4.86">with the Western goals foundation as</text>
  <text start="391.83" dur="4.649">Alex Jones pointed out and Roy Cohn was</text>
  <text start="394.47" dur="5.1">Trump&amp;#39;s lawyer for a very very long time</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="4.951">so I know it means he was sort of he had</text>
  <text start="399.57" dur="4.59">a reputation of being just a badass</text>
  <text start="401.43" dur="5.66">yeah he was definitely a tough guy and</text>
  <text start="404.16" dur="5.34">and you know he was a communist yeah and</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="5.32">so you know Trump knows all this stuff</text>
  <text start="409.5" dur="5.1">and you you have to wonder what is going</text>
  <text start="412.41" dur="4.289">on here and frankly I can&amp;#39;t say that I</text>
  <text start="414.6" dur="3.96">know but you know if you look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="416.699" dur="4.051">happening just today on Twitter today is</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="3.75">what the 27th through the 28th just</text>
  <text start="420.75" dur="4.889">today on Twitter Trump was talking about</text>
  <text start="422.31" dur="5.1">reverting to pre nap the situation he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.639" dur="3.241">all upset about the wall and he says you</text>
  <text start="427.41" dur="3">know what fine we&amp;#39;ll just go back to pre</text>
  <text start="428.88" dur="3.539">NAFTA we&amp;#39;ll get all the car companies</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="3.45">manufacturing cars in America again and</text>
  <text start="432.419" dur="3.601">we&amp;#39;ll close the border down and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="3.45">see how you guys like and yeah yeah and</text>
  <text start="436.02" dur="3.09">on top of that he even said something</text>
  <text start="437.31" dur="4.29">about pulling all the the funds that we</text>
  <text start="439.11" dur="4.26">give to Honduras and a few of the other</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="4.74">South American countries I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.37" dur="5.49">like a big 15,000 strong plus Caravan</text>
  <text start="446.34" dur="3.87">about the head this way yeah that just</text>
  <text start="448.86" dur="3.36">means we&amp;#39;ll save even more money</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="4.709">yeah just say more aid to these</text>
  <text start="452.22" dur="4.53">countries yeah and so you know there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="454.919" dur="5.37">chance that Trump is being strategic</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="5.759">here and I hope he is I hope that you</text>
  <text start="460.289" dur="3.511">know he&amp;#39;ll pull us out of NAFTA and then</text>
  <text start="462.509" dur="3.361">say all right Congress now vote on this</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="4.619">u.s. MCA knowing that it will go down in</text>
  <text start="465.87" dur="5.91">flames I hope that&amp;#39;s the case of course</text>
  <text start="468.419" dur="5.041">we can&amp;#39;t be sure and you know I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="471.78" dur="3">this from the start you know where Trump</text>
  <text start="473.46" dur="3.09">is right which has been on a lot of</text>
  <text start="474.78" dur="3.509">issues we need to support him and where</text>
  <text start="476.55" dur="3.81">he&amp;#39;s wrong we need to call him out and</text>
  <text start="478.289" dur="4.051">unfortunately this u.s. MCA is one of</text>
  <text start="480.36" dur="3.809">those areas where you know that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="482.34" dur="3.9">it goes against everything that we voted</text>
  <text start="484.169" dur="4.051">for it goes against his pledges to stop</text>
  <text start="486.24" dur="4.53">globalism to promote Americanism it goes</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="4.11">his pledge against his pledge to stop</text>

  <text start="591.13" dur="3.21">like that we can replace those members</text>

  <text start="604.66" dur="4.23">rid of that right away this is obscene</text>
  <text start="606.82" dur="3.87">this is ridiculous and I think one of</text>
  <text start="608.89" dur="4.71">the reasons why Trump was elected was</text>
  <text start="610.69" dur="5.07">because he was so forceful in speaking</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="3.93">out about you so for you know for all</text>
  <text start="615.76" dur="3.45">the good that he&amp;#39;s done I hope that</text>
  <text start="617.53" dur="4.01">somebody will show him hey look here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.21" dur="5.52">what&amp;#39;s in this ridiculous agreement and</text>
  <text start="621.54" dur="4.72">now let&amp;#39;s you know take the steps to</text>
  <text start="624.73" dur="2.61">show today the American people and you</text>
  <text start="626.26" dur="2.52">know this is a kind of a hard position</text>
  <text start="627.34" dur="2.97">for him to walk back from now because</text>
  <text start="628.78" dur="3.11">he&amp;#39;s on record saying that it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="630.31" dur="3.78">deal and that we should support it but</text>
  <text start="631.89" dur="4.6">hopefully he can find a way to</text>
  <text start="634.09" dur="5.1">gracefully walk back this whole fiasco</text>
  <text start="636.49" dur="5.64">fire Robert light Heiser he was deceived</text>
  <text start="639.19" dur="6.33">and hopefully we can not turn lemons</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="5.34">into lemonade yeah in the wake home kind</text>
  <text start="645.52" dur="3.45">of back to that she says it all in the</text>
  <text start="647.47" dur="6.27">sense if you know his history he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="648.97" dur="7.41">Machiavellian eyes the means sort of a</text>
  <text start="653.74" dur="4.74">guy and Trump hanging out and associated</text>
  <text start="656.38" dur="3.45">associated with him and choosing that</text>
  <text start="658.48" dur="3.24">kind of a relationship which was</text>
  <text start="659.83" dur="4.68">probably very profitable useful</text>
  <text start="661.72" dur="4.23">association both ways but him hanging</text>
  <text start="664.51" dur="3.57">out with him shows that trunk himself</text>
  <text start="665.95" dur="3.84">has that sort of a Machiavellian signed</text>
  <text start="668.08" dur="3.75">so he&amp;#39;s definitely willing to</text>
  <text start="669.79" dur="3.93">playing and just think to how like when</text>
  <text start="671.83" dur="4.85">our side was getting bashed bound by an</text>
  <text start="673.72" dur="4.83">Tifa trunk did nothing for months right</text>
  <text start="676.68" dur="3.31">even though many of us were kind of</text>
  <text start="678.55" dur="3.51">upset like hey where&amp;#39;s the help we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="679.99" dur="3.57">getting hurt out on the streets while</text>
  <text start="682.06" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;re going to peaceful protests or</text>
  <text start="683.56" dur="5.16">speeches and stuff so he&amp;#39;s willing to do</text>
  <text start="686.38" dur="4.47">what it takes to win even if if our side</text>
  <text start="688.72" dur="5.72">sorta has to go through some pain yeah</text>
  <text start="690.85" dur="6.09">yeah and yeah I think it&amp;#39;s amazing that</text>
  <text start="694.44" dur="3.94">at this time in history we have somebody</text>
  <text start="696.94" dur="3.93">like him because you know as much as I</text>
  <text start="698.38" dur="5.76">love people like Ron Paul you know Ron</text>
  <text start="700.87" dur="5.01">Paul I think he&amp;#39;s such a great guy he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="704.14" dur="4.05">right on as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned almost</text>
  <text start="705.88" dur="4.26">all the issues but you know when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="708.19" dur="3.99">facing a steamroller you can&amp;#39;t just play</text>
  <text start="710.14" dur="3.6">nice and say would you please kindly you</text>
  <text start="712.18" dur="4.17">know get out of the steamroller and stop</text>
  <text start="713.74" dur="5.67">running over us you have to be a tough</text>
  <text start="716.35" dur="5.31">guy and you know play hardball and Trump</text>
  <text start="719.41" dur="3.81">really has been willing to do that and I</text>
  <text start="721.66" dur="3.99">think he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s got the type of</text>
  <text start="723.22" dur="4.02">personality that&amp;#39;s really the only type</text>
  <text start="725.65" dur="3.36">of personality that could have dealt</text>
  <text start="727.24" dur="3.45">with the situation he&amp;#39;s dealing with</text>
  <text start="729.01" dur="3.66">he&amp;#39;s got the media against him he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="730.69" dur="4.41">the leadership of both political parties</text>
  <text start="732.67" dur="4.95">against him he&amp;#39;s got to the United</text>
  <text start="735.1" dur="4.77">Nations against him the big crony</text>
  <text start="737.62" dur="4.32">businesses against him you know the the</text>
  <text start="739.87" dur="4.17">foreign policy establishment every arm</text>
  <text start="741.94" dur="4.23">of the deep state the secret societies</text>
  <text start="744.04" dur="3.72">and and yet he&amp;#39;s still there and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="746.17" dur="4.8">still fighting any still kicking so</text>
  <text start="747.76" dur="5.19">because it&amp;#39;s remarkable to see and know</text>
  <text start="750.97" dur="3.72">for all the good that he&amp;#39;s done it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="752.95" dur="3">very sad to see this with the u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="754.69" dur="3.66">but again hopefully something good will</text>
  <text start="755.95" dur="5.54">come out of it so he&amp;#39;s got legendary</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="6.42">willpower you know he&amp;#39;s obstinate is how</text>
  <text start="761.49" dur="4.66">he sort of thrives on the sort of</text>
  <text start="764.77" dur="3.69">conflict that they&amp;#39;re throwing at him</text>
  <text start="766.15" dur="4.95">anyway I don&amp;#39;t know how he can continue</text>
  <text start="768.46" dur="4.08">to work those sorts of hours you know</text>
  <text start="771.1" dur="2.91">and I&amp;#39;ve played those sorts of hours I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="772.54" dur="3.03">a young guy and I can barely do it I</text>
  <text start="774.01" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t know how he can do it at his age</text>
  <text start="775.57" dur="6.54">while eating McDonald&amp;#39;s and drinking</text>
  <text start="777.01" dur="8.54">diet sodas to see obviously he&amp;#39;s on some</text>
  <text start="782.11" dur="7.56">sort of Superman drug I don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="785.55" dur="6.34">is I would rather see a sort of more of</text>
  <text start="789.67" dur="5.04">a Thor figure right now than a Ron Paul</text>
  <text start="791.89" dur="4.53">figure and I think that&amp;#39;s Trump&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="794.71" dur="4.74">as close as we&amp;#39;re gonna get even with</text>
  <text start="796.42" dur="4.98">their giving so we&amp;#39;re good yeah no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="799.45" dur="4">true it&amp;#39;s true yeah I think you know a</text>
  <text start="801.4" dur="3.16">normal person could not withstand</text>
  <text start="803.45" dur="3.6">the kind of pressure that&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="804.56" dur="4.62">brought to bear right now you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="807.05" dur="4.38">just it takes a special kind of person</text>
  <text start="809.18" dur="4.41">who&amp;#39;s who&amp;#39;s willing to fight tough and</text>
  <text start="811.43" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;ve seen that and so I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="813.59" dur="3.96">still hoping that there is some sort of</text>
  <text start="815.81" dur="3.81">you know something that we&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="817.55" dur="3.39">yet regarding this u.s. MCA and it may</text>
  <text start="819.62" dur="4.05">well be you know he&amp;#39;s talked publicly</text>
  <text start="820.94" dur="4.74">about how he may just get rid of NAFTA</text>
  <text start="823.67" dur="4.29">and let&amp;#39;s see what happens so that may</text>
  <text start="825.68" dur="3.96">be the key there what you and so what I</text>
  <text start="827.96" dur="3.9">think the American people need to do and</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="3.63">what we have been doing is working with</text>
  <text start="831.86" dur="3.15">our members of Congress to make sure</text>
  <text start="833.27" dur="4.44">that if and when this comes to a vote</text>
  <text start="835.01" dur="5.1">that it&amp;#39;s voted down I think another</text>
  <text start="837.71" dur="3.9">important factor to consider here is you</text>
  <text start="840.11" dur="3.54">know the Mexicans are considering this a</text>
  <text start="841.61" dur="3.6">treaty because it is a tree and so they</text>
  <text start="843.65" dur="3.45">have their proper ratification</text>
  <text start="845.21" dur="4.08">procedures under their constitution to</text>
  <text start="847.1" dur="4.56">ratify a treaty but we have ours right</text>
  <text start="849.29" dur="5.18">ours requires two-thirds majority in the</text>
  <text start="851.66" dur="5.34">US Senate to ratify a treaty and</text>
  <text start="854.47" dur="4.09">unfortunately they&amp;#39;re acting as if hey</text>
  <text start="857" dur="3.15">this is just an agreement and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="858.56" dur="2.73">need to ratify it properly through the</text>
  <text start="860.15" dur="2.7">Senate well I would argue that they do</text>
  <text start="861.29" dur="3.6">need to ratify properly through the</text>
  <text start="862.85" dur="4.41">Senate and even then you know there are</text>
  <text start="864.89" dur="5.22">so many unconstitutional provisions in</text>
  <text start="867.26" dur="5.19">this u.s. MCA Congress has no power to</text>
  <text start="870.11" dur="4.11">delegate powers that it never had to</text>
  <text start="872.45" dur="3.27">begin with to North American</text>
  <text start="874.22" dur="2.58">bureaucracies or to anyone else so if</text>
  <text start="875.72" dur="2.37">they don&amp;#39;t have the power to do</text>
  <text start="876.8" dur="5.04">something they can&amp;#39;t delegate that power</text>
  <text start="878.09" dur="5.79">to somebody else and hit this u.s. MCA</text>
  <text start="881.84" dur="4.74">is just filled with unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="883.88" dur="3.96">usurpations of power that not even the</text>
  <text start="886.58" dur="2.82">federal government has authority to</text>
  <text start="887.84" dur="4.29">exercise these kinds of powers so they</text>
  <text start="889.4" dur="4.2">can&amp;#39;t transfer these powers to anybody</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="3.66">else much less than North American</text>
  <text start="893.6" dur="3.75">bureaucracy and I think we need to you</text>
  <text start="895.79" dur="3.39">know keep our eye on the bigger long</text>
  <text start="897.35" dur="4.53">term goal here you know the globalists</text>
  <text start="899.18" dur="3.99">are not interested in real free trade in</text>
  <text start="901.88" dur="3.3">fact if they were interested in real</text>
  <text start="903.17" dur="3.51">free trade we wouldn&amp;#39;t need 1800 pages</text>
  <text start="905.18" dur="4.2">of regulations I think this is</text>
  <text start="906.68" dur="4.53">self-evidently true free trade doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="909.38" dur="4.23">require all this it just requires the</text>
  <text start="911.21" dur="4.2">government getting out of the way and so</text>
  <text start="913.61" dur="4.32">this is not free trade at all what it is</text>
  <text start="915.41" dur="4.23">is it&amp;#39;s a stepping stone toward building</text>
  <text start="917.93" dur="4.05">the North American Union that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="919.64" dur="4.26">been after for a long time now there was</text>
  <text start="921.98" dur="4.43">a guy at the Council on Foreign</text>
  <text start="923.9" dur="4.86">Relations he was kind of the the</text>
  <text start="926.41" dur="4.45">ringleader if you will of the North</text>
  <text start="928.76" dur="5.34">American integration agenda as name was</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="4.59">Robert pastor and he was the guy who</text>
  <text start="934.1" dur="2.68">came up with his North American</text>
  <text start="935.45" dur="3.61">community blueprint</text>
  <text start="936.78" dur="4.32">at the Council on Foreign Relations and</text>
  <text start="939.06" dur="4.23">he put out a book shortly before he died</text>
  <text start="941.1" dur="5.04">and he accused the John Birch Society in</text>
  <text start="943.29" dur="4.65">the Eagle Forum of stomping his little</text>
  <text start="946.14" dur="3.42">agenda for a North American Union for</text>
  <text start="947.94" dur="2.49">closer North American integration so</text>
  <text start="949.56" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s quite an honor</text>
  <text start="950.43" dur="5.46">right when when they only come out it is</text>
  <text start="953.04" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s good but so what I want to say is</text>
  <text start="955.89" dur="4.11">you know we can stop this and we also</text>
  <text start="957.81" dur="3.93">need to realize that this is not just an</text>
  <text start="960" dur="3.09">ending of itself right they don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="961.74" dur="2.82">want a trade agreement to have a trade</text>
  <text start="963.09" dur="3.48">agreement the reason they want this is</text>
  <text start="964.56" dur="4.11">because they want to divide the whole</text>
  <text start="966.57" dur="5.13">world up into these regional governments</text>
  <text start="968.67" dur="4.56">and you know they&amp;#39;ve done this in region</text>
  <text start="971.7" dur="3.81">after region obviously the European</text>
  <text start="973.23" dur="4.83">Union is the premier example and they</text>
  <text start="975.51" dur="4.98">now have a European Parliament a single</text>
  <text start="978.06" dur="4.35">European currency some estimates say</text>
  <text start="980.49" dur="3.39">like 95 percent of the laws now they</text>
  <text start="982.41" dur="3.78">govern the lives of Europeans are</text>
  <text start="983.88" dur="3.45">concocted by unelected bureaucrats in</text>
  <text start="986.19" dur="2.61">the European Commission and they have a</text>
  <text start="987.33" dur="2.79">rubber stamp Parliament kind of like the</text>
  <text start="988.8" dur="4.32">Soviet Union had a rubber stamp</text>
  <text start="990.12" dur="4.59">Parliament without any real power but so</text>
  <text start="993.12" dur="3.3">you now have this regional government</text>
  <text start="994.71" dur="3.57">that has almost complete control over</text>
  <text start="996.42" dur="3.36">its member states even in areas where</text>

  <text start="1725.04" dur="3.81">optimistic about the future at the same</text>

  <text start="1731.91" dur="2.76">this is back</text>
  <text start="1733.29" dur="3.06">I think people need to be aware of it</text>
  <text start="1734.67" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s just one other thing that we need</text>
  <text start="1736.35" dur="4.08">to oppose you know absolutely and you</text>
  <text start="1738.9" dur="2.88">know on the Fed it&amp;#39;s interesting even</text>
  <text start="1740.43" dur="2.58">while Trump was running for president I</text>
  <text start="1741.78" dur="3.69">wrote an article about this because he</text>
  <text start="1743.01" dur="3.75">had made these bombshell comments about</text>
  <text start="1745.47" dur="3.45">the Federal Reserve and how they were</text>
  <text start="1746.76" dur="6.33">rigging the economy and manipulating</text>
  <text start="1748.92" dur="5.7">interest rates to Juneau yeah he did he</text>
  <text start="1753.09" dur="3.15">said we&amp;#39;d be better off on a gold Center</text>
  <text start="1754.62" dur="3.9">and Mike Pence vice president Mike Pence</text>
  <text start="1756.24" dur="3.57">has said the same thing so um you know</text>
  <text start="1758.52" dur="4.02">these are guys who know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1759.81" dur="5.52">talking about who understand far more</text>
  <text start="1762.54" dur="5.94">than they let on you know in a typical</text>
  <text start="1765.33" dur="5.1">public interview and so you know I think</text>
  <text start="1768.48" dur="3.87">very good things could come out of this</text>
  <text start="1770.43" dur="4.43">but you know what they&amp;#39;re up against I</text>
  <text start="1772.35" dur="6.06">think it is just a massively powerful</text>
  <text start="1774.86" dur="5.86">and evil I mean a diabolical force that</text>
  <text start="1778.41" dur="3.6">not only wants to destroy Trump and the</text>
  <text start="1780.72" dur="2.64">people who voted for him but wants to</text>
  <text start="1782.01" dur="2.49">destroy everything that this country was</text>
  <text start="1783.36" dur="3.84">founded on everything that&amp;#39;s good about</text>
  <text start="1784.5" dur="4.71">this country and they&amp;#39;ve had a lot of</text>
  <text start="1787.2" dur="4.92">time to amass political power economic</text>
  <text start="1789.21" dur="4.47">power power over the modes of</text>
  <text start="1792.12" dur="3.42">communication now the Internet has kind</text>
  <text start="1793.68" dur="4.14">of done some damage there I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1795.54" dur="3.63">the only reason why they lost the 2016</text>
  <text start="1797.82" dur="3.87">election is because they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1799.17" dur="4.05">control the narrative anymore but you</text>
  <text start="1801.69" dur="3.36">know this is not gonna be a cakewalk so</text>
  <text start="1803.22" dur="3.54">I think everybody who&amp;#39;s listening to</text>
  <text start="1805.05" dur="3.48">this you know even even if Trump is</text>
  <text start="1806.76" dur="3.84">everything we want him to be he cannot</text>
  <text start="1808.53" dur="3.57">do this on his own you know we all need</text>
  <text start="1810.6" dur="3.24">to be doing our part educating our</text>
  <text start="1812.1" dur="3.9">communities working with our members of</text>
  <text start="1813.84" dur="3.63">Congress to make sure they&amp;#39;re following</text>
  <text start="1816" dur="5.13">the Constitution that they understand</text>
  <text start="1817.47" dur="6.18">and you know Sun Tzu to quote Sun Tzu he</text>
  <text start="1821.13" dur="4.77">said something incredibly important you</text>
  <text start="1823.65" dur="3.81">know if you know yourself but you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1825.9" dur="3.81">know your enemy you&amp;#39;re gonna lose a</text>
  <text start="1827.46" dur="3.63">battle and win a battle if you know your</text>
  <text start="1829.71" dur="3.51">enemy but you don&amp;#39;t know yourself you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1831.09" dur="3.48">win a battle you&amp;#39;ll lose a battle if you</text>
  <text start="1833.22" dur="2.88">don&amp;#39;t know yourself or your enemy you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1834.57" dur="3.33">gonna lose every battle but if you know</text>
  <text start="1836.1" dur="4.38">yourself and you know your enemy you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1837.9" dur="4.8">win every battle so I think what we need</text>
  <text start="1840.48" dur="5.28">to be doing and I recommended that Trump</text>
  <text start="1842.7" dur="4.95">but take this message to heart and just</text>
  <text start="1845.76" dur="3.72">start giving you know fireside chats to</text>
  <text start="1847.65" dur="4.02">the American people we need to know who</text>
  <text start="1849.48" dur="3.75">we are you know most Americans who are</text>
  <text start="1851.67" dur="3.3">educated in a government brainwash camp</text>
  <text start="1853.23" dur="3.3">have no idea what&amp;#39;s written in our</text>

  <text start="1856.53" dur="3.57">real American history American heritage</text>
  <text start="1858.6" dur="4.29">you know who we are as a people</text>
  <text start="1860.1" dur="4.71">constitutionally focused fireside</text>
  <text start="1862.89" dur="2.82">exactly can you imagine just educating</text>
  <text start="1864.81" dur="2.099">American business</text>
  <text start="1865.71" dur="2.76">in the Constitution this is what the</text>
  <text start="1866.909" dur="3.331">framers said this is why we have a</text>
  <text start="1868.47" dur="3.75">country this is why the pilgrims came</text>
  <text start="1870.24" dur="3.539">over you know just real American history</text>
  <text start="1872.22" dur="2.939">you could do it you know two hours and</text>
  <text start="1873.779" dur="2.611">just blow up all the myths that the</text>
  <text start="1875.159" dur="3.451">government schools have put out there</text>
  <text start="1876.39" dur="3.81">and that would be business but I would</text>
  <text start="1878.61" dur="3.449">love to see them wouldn&amp;#39;t it be</text>
  <text start="1880.2" dur="3.54">brilliant yeah you know then we could go</text>
  <text start="1882.059" dur="3.6">back to doing other things yeah I would</text>
  <text start="1883.74" dur="3.21">love to get out of media and love to get</text>
  <text start="1885.659" dur="2.581">out of this and just go I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1886.95" dur="2.94">start a business just so they&amp;#39;d be just</text>
  <text start="1888.24" dur="3.75">great but unfortunately you know right</text>
  <text start="1889.89" dur="3.72">now I don&amp;#39;t think we can because if we</text>
  <text start="1891.99" dur="2.939">drop the ball here our kids are gonna</text>
  <text start="1893.61" dur="3.75">grow up as slaves the stakes are that</text>
  <text start="1894.929" dur="3.511">high and so you know that would be the</text>
  <text start="1897.36" dur="2.73">first you know and make sure the</text>
  <text start="1898.44" dur="3.33">American people know themselves because</text>
  <text start="1900.09" dur="3.24">right now there&amp;#39;s tremendous ignorant</text>
  <text start="1901.77" dur="3.42">out there about our own history about</text>
  <text start="1903.33" dur="4.68">our constitution about what our nation</text>
  <text start="1905.19" dur="4.26">was supposed to be and then on the other</text>
  <text start="1908.01" dur="3.96">side we need to know who is the enemy</text>
  <text start="1909.45" dur="3.959">you know what are we dealing with here</text>
  <text start="1911.97" dur="3.27">who are these people who want to</text>
  <text start="1913.409" dur="3.211">overthrow our constitutional system of</text>
  <text start="1915.24" dur="2.939">government who are these people who are</text>
  <text start="1916.62" dur="2.909">trying to subvert our sovereignty and</text>
  <text start="1918.179" dur="3.451">build up what they call a new world</text>
  <text start="1919.529" dur="3.931">order and until we understand who we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1921.63" dur="3.419">dealing with you know it&amp;#39;s very hard to</text>
  <text start="1923.46" dur="4.05">battle them and people talk about them</text>
  <text start="1925.049" dur="4.141">as a they or you know give them names</text>
  <text start="1927.51" dur="2.85">like Illuminati or deep state but we</text>
  <text start="1929.19" dur="3.209">need to break it down we need to show</text>
  <text start="1930.36" dur="3.33">people that are organizing bad things</text>
  <text start="1932.399" dur="2.941">that&amp;#39;s not that hard to believe right</text>
  <text start="1933.69" dur="3.81">right exactly</text>
  <text start="1935.34" dur="3.9">and so we need to start putting you know</text>
  <text start="1937.5" dur="3.24">names to this we need to start getting</text>
  <text start="1939.24" dur="2.97">the American people up to speed on this</text>
  <text start="1940.74" dur="3.87">and so we actually did a special issue</text>
  <text start="1942.21" dur="3.719">of the new American called deep State</text>
  <text start="1944.61" dur="4.169">pulling the strings behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="1945.929" dur="4.62">and we break this down you know step by</text>

  <text start="2398.789" dur="3.24">garden you&amp;#39;re right this is not a battle</text>
  <text start="2400.169" dur="3.211">that you know we&amp;#39;re gonna win and</text>
  <text start="2402.029" dur="2.4">suddenly you know our kids are gonna</text>
  <text start="2403.38" dur="3.659">grow up and everything&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="2404.429" dur="4.471">flowers and roses no this is a perpetual</text>
  <text start="2407.039" dur="3.93">I mean this is gonna go on forever these</text>
  <text start="2408.9" dur="3.48">people and the forces behind them</text>
  <text start="2410.969" dur="2.73">they&amp;#39;ve been operating for a very long</text>
  <text start="2412.38" dur="3.539">time and they&amp;#39;re not gonna go anywhere</text>
  <text start="2413.699" dur="4.32">right we can send them back we can stop</text>
  <text start="2415.919" dur="3.12">them for a while but they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="2418.019" dur="3.2">go anywhere they&amp;#39;re gonna continue</text>
  <text start="2419.039" dur="5.22">coming back with their agenda of</text>
  <text start="2421.219" dur="5.38">totalitarianism of globalism of open</text>
  <text start="2424.259" dur="4.77">borders of massive government control</text>
  <text start="2426.599" dur="4.051">and so you know as some of our founders</text>
  <text start="2429.029" dur="3.81">said the price of freedom is eternal</text>
  <text start="2430.65" dur="4.379">vigilance if you want to stay free if</text>
  <text start="2432.839" dur="4.23">you want your kids to grow up free you</text>
  <text start="2435.029" dur="4.65">have to be involved nobody else is gonna</text>
  <text start="2437.069" dur="4.38">do it for you yeah and and I think there</text>
  <text start="2439.679" dur="4.05">is some argument like I absolutely</text>
  <text start="2441.449" dur="3.6">believe in evil and I believe that a lot</text>
  <text start="2443.729" dur="2.7">of the people running the show on the</text>
  <text start="2445.049" dur="3.3">bad side of the world are evil</text>
  <text start="2446.429" dur="3.87">completely but there is also some</text>
  <text start="2448.349" dur="4.531">argument because you know they are able</text>
  <text start="2450.299" dur="4.44">to turn children especially their own</text>
  <text start="2452.88" dur="4.919">children into sort of copycat</text>
  <text start="2454.739" dur="4.86">Psychopaths more often than not I think</text>
  <text start="2457.799" dur="4.53">some aspect of all the evil we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2459.599" dur="5.1">dealing with in the world it is almost</text>
  <text start="2462.329" dur="4.59">sort of a mental illness brain damage</text>
  <text start="2464.699" dur="5.191">sort of thing like I don&amp;#39;t know how much</text>
  <text start="2466.919" dur="5.28">of its evil or how much of its people</text>
  <text start="2469.89" dur="3.449">following into a certain path or</text>
  <text start="2472.199" dur="2.58">something because that&amp;#39;s what they grow</text>
  <text start="2473.339" dur="4.14">up around that&amp;#39;s what the influence was</text>
  <text start="2474.779" dur="6.03">maybe they were abused and had damage or</text>
  <text start="2477.479" dur="5.7">something like that and then this sort</text>
  <text start="2480.809" dur="3.96">of active spreading and procreation of</text>
  <text start="2483.179" dur="4.05">evil sort of works in that sense so</text>
  <text start="2484.769" dur="4.95">damaged people damaged people on and on</text>
  <text start="2487.229" dur="5.07">and on and on and on and that&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="2489.719" dur="3.931">breaking the cycle and changing that I</text>
  <text start="2492.299" dur="3.39">think that gets kind of back to the</text>
  <text start="2493.65" dur="3.959">heart of the whole Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone</text>
  <text start="2495.689" dur="4.11">argument trying to change base metals</text>
  <text start="2497.609" dur="3.69">into gold or tor changer your lead and</text>
  <text start="2499.799" dur="4.68">the gold you know spiritually speaking</text>
  <text start="2501.299" dur="4.8">yeah you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one of those</text>
  <text start="2504.479" dur="3.901">things like across all of what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2506.099" dur="4.2">on the entire world ideological war</text>
  <text start="2508.38" dur="3.869">every single person has to make that</text>
  <text start="2510.299" dur="5.01">decision whether or not they want to</text>
  <text start="2512.249" dur="5.27">pursue the higher self and and be more</text>
  <text start="2515.309" dur="5.22">noble and pursue you know better world</text>
  <text start="2517.519" dur="4.871">values morals in any way that they can</text>
  <text start="2520.529" dur="5.01">whether it be like you were saying</text>
  <text start="2522.39" dur="5.839">volunteering time supporting independent</text>
  <text start="2525.539" dur="4.62">media or the new American for example</text>
  <text start="2528.229" dur="3.391">organizing you know and then like I said</text>

  <text start="2534.5" dur="3.81">probably the best thing out there other</text>
