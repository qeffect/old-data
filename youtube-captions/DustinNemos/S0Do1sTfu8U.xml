  <text start="0.62" dur="6.699">hey guys so first I put out the the Book</text>
  <text start="5.759" dur="3.241">of Enoch video that I was talking about</text>
  <text start="7.319" dur="4.021">earlier I put out part two and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="9" dur="5.37">put out part one I completely spaced on</text>
  <text start="11.34" dur="4.2">that so I apologize both are now out so</text>
  <text start="14.37" dur="4.739">check out part one so it makes complete</text>
  <text start="15.54" dur="4.98">sense while we were talking about the</text>
  <text start="19.109" dur="3.66">Book of Enoch and law I was reading</text>
  <text start="20.52" dur="4.919">through it I noticed that it said that</text>
  <text start="22.769" dur="6.151">the two hundred fallen angels the the</text>
  <text start="25.439" dur="7.741">Watchers the grigory basically the devil</text>
  <text start="28.92" dur="6.569">and his buddies they somehow two hundred</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="3.66">of them fell two hundred Myriad&amp;#39;s and I</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="2.671">think a maryada is like a thousand</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="3.629">thousand or something it comes out to</text>
  <text start="38.16" dur="4.649">like two million I heard so two million</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="3.66">of them fell to the earth and blah blah</text>
  <text start="42.809" dur="4.82">blah but the place that they supposedly</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="6.061">fell was called artists and that kind of</text>
  <text start="47.629" dur="4.331">hit like it kind of triggered something</text>
  <text start="50.19" dur="3.06">in my memory and I remembered back to</text>
  <text start="51.96" dur="3.63">one of my favorite books is a can the</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="4.379">Lord of the Rings so I&amp;#39;m just gonna take</text>
  <text start="55.59" dur="3.949">a real quick break from like my research</text>
  <text start="57.629" dur="4.971">and stuff we&amp;#39;re about to eat dinner</text>
  <text start="59.539" dur="6.491">boogers is hanging out with me right now</text>
  <text start="62.6" dur="5.379">that&amp;#39;s my nickname for Athena or stinky</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="4.32">but you know one of the other will</text>
  <text start="67.979" dur="5.131">figure it out but I noticed that the</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="4.35">similarity between the word artists in</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="3">the world artists so if you guys are any</text>
  <text start="74.7" dur="3.51">you know anyone out there is a die-hard</text>
  <text start="76.11" dur="4.35">Lord of the Rings fan like myself you</text>
  <text start="78.21" dur="4.38">may have read this still marillion which</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="6.78">is sort of the story behind the Rings</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="6.45">before the ring and and before the I</text>
  <text start="87.24" dur="4.98">think it&amp;#39;s the Third Age where where</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re doing the whole Mordor and you</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="5.31">know and off and Sauron and all of that</text>
  <text start="95.43" dur="4.29">so the whole war of the ring is</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="3.57">basically the story of the Third Age but</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="3.62">if you go back into the first in the</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="5.25">Second Age it&amp;#39;s a really cool story and</text>
  <text start="103.34" dur="5.5">it has so many parallels it really makes</text>
  <text start="106.35" dur="4.229">me wonder how much has original thought</text>
  <text start="108.84" dur="5.94">and how much is just the same stories</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="5.79">retold throughout history so let me get</text>
  <text start="114.78" dur="3.839">to what I mean by the same by</text>
  <text start="116.369" dur="6.18">similarities and in what what themes</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="7.951">right so in the the universe right like</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="5.94">Tolkien&amp;#39;s whole fantasy story that</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="4.83">became the coolest thing ever</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="4.171">I read my Lord of the Rings copy you</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="2.1">know in middle school until it fell</text>
  <text start="132.66" dur="2.37">apart</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="3.03">then I bought more copies okay I love</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="6.54">that book</text>
  <text start="136.53" dur="7.47">in his world arrow which is like the</text>
  <text start="141.57" dur="3.96">Creator the consciousness it&amp;#39;s not it</text>
  <text start="144" dur="4.32">doesn&amp;#39;t really play a very active role</text>
  <text start="145.53" dur="6.54">in the universe not necessarily</text>
  <text start="148.32" dur="7.2">considered like a good God just there</text>
  <text start="152.07" dur="7.38">and all-powerful created this music this</text>
  <text start="155.52" dur="7.17">this beautiful orchestral music right</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="5.64">and from the music was birthed the gods</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="4.74">and the angels it&amp;#39;s called the the Vala</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="4.56">and the Maya now I&amp;#39;m a big nerd I used</text>
  <text start="167.43" dur="4.14">to actually be part of the the fan club</text>
  <text start="169.65" dur="7.11">called valor guild for Lord of the Rings</text>
  <text start="171.57" dur="7.74">okay so anyway oh man</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="5.34">so the Vala were the greater gods they</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="7.56">were excuse me</text>
  <text start="182.1" dur="7.02">they were like the immortal giant powers</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="4.65">right they they they had an aspect like</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="5.1">there was Olmo god of the sea</text>
  <text start="191.52" dur="4.53">very poseidon like there was mon way</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="3.329">which was a very zeus like figure and</text>
  <text start="196.05" dur="4.469">there was Melkor the greatest of them</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="5.311">all he was the Lucifer figure in</text>
  <text start="200.519" dur="4.921">Tolkien&amp;#39;s sword let me explain what I</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="4.32">mean by that there were the Vala the</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="3.39">grodd&amp;#39;s and they were the Maya which</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="3.119">were these sort of like the Angels</text>
  <text start="208.83" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re sort of the same species but</text>
  <text start="210.299" dur="4.051">they&amp;#39;re lesser and they&amp;#39;re not immortal</text>
  <text start="212.07" dur="5.21">they can be killed otherwise they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="6.18">mobile so and they have powers like</text>
  <text start="217.28" dur="5.5">Gandalf for example was a Maya he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="8.28">wizard he takes on the form of a human</text>
  <text start="222.78" dur="10.769">wizard and he he can do that but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="7.73">actually an angelic being a Maya Sal Ron</text>
  <text start="233.549" dur="7.381">the bad guy in Lord of the Rings the</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="7.27">Lord of the Ring himself was also one of</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="5.49">the most powerful of the Maya cast the</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="6.149">Angels and it&amp;#39;s sort of a similar story</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="6.12">with him he was actually one of the</text>
  <text start="249.959" dur="3.84">angels under the craftsmen God which is</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="3.75">a whole other story</text>
  <text start="253.799" dur="4.41">the god of basically crafting and stuff</text>
  <text start="256.29" dur="3.479">which is how he learned his skill with</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="3.12">the rings and everything else it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="259.769" dur="3.301">crazy story it really is it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="261.329" dur="3.84">fascinating if you&amp;#39;re into that kind of</text>
  <text start="263.07" dur="3.28">thing it&amp;#39;s great for kids too because it</text>
  <text start="265.169" dur="3.971">builds creativity and stuff</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="6.48">and empathy to read you&amp;#39;re gonna read</text>
  <text start="269.14" dur="8.43">plenty so that they they come into being</text>
  <text start="272.83" dur="7.92">right and they join in the music they</text>
  <text start="277.57" dur="5.94">create music with arrow so you have all</text>
  <text start="280.75" dur="6.39">of the gods and then the angels singing</text>
  <text start="283.51" dur="6.24">with their voice into the great you know</text>
  <text start="287.14" dur="4.92">the great symphony the great harmony and</text>
  <text start="289.75" dur="4.89">then the world begins to take shape from</text>
  <text start="292.06" dur="4.86">this music in each adds something to it</text>
  <text start="294.64" dur="4.02">you know according to their nature</text>
  <text start="296.92" dur="6.51">according to their strength and their</text>
  <text start="298.66" dur="7.14">scope and it shapes the world it creates</text>
  <text start="303.43" dur="3.9">time it creates heat it creates cold it</text>
  <text start="305.8" dur="5.1">creates water of dirt rock whatever</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="7.26">creates life it creates all of this but</text>
  <text start="310.9" dur="6.38">Melkor have having seen what he was you</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="5.34">know what he was part of having pride</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="4.78">because he was the greatest of all next</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="4.5">to a rule himself he&amp;#39;s starting to see</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="6.18">some similarities right well he I</text>
  <text start="324.43" dur="6.06">started to see his own song and he meant</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="5.25">well but he didn&amp;#39;t follow the plan he</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="5.55">didn&amp;#39;t follow his father&amp;#39;s plan he</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="5.49">followed his own plan he chose the</text>
  <text start="336.04" dur="7.7">left-handed path the path of selfishness</text>
  <text start="338.98" dur="7.23">and and and pride and self servants and</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="4.12">in doing in rent rather than the choice</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="5.94">of right living and righteousness and</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="7.35">and service of virtue so you know in</text>
  <text start="352.15" dur="5.63">doing so he created problems in the the</text>
  <text start="355.21" dur="5.52">song there was a disharmony there was a</text>
  <text start="357.78" dur="6.61">discordant you know I didn&amp;#39;t sound quite</text>
  <text start="360.73" dur="7.62">as good now it had its own beauty but it</text>
  <text start="364.39" dur="5.76">marred the perfect creation now there</text>
  <text start="368.35" dur="3.3">was evil now there was death now there</text>
  <text start="370.15" dur="3.69">was pain now there was suffering now</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="4.53">there were there were negative</text>
  <text start="373.84" dur="4.2">experiences as part of the the sphere</text>
  <text start="376.18" dur="4.71">that they created that they experienced</text>
  <text start="378.04" dur="4.83">the planet and when they were done with</text>
  <text start="380.89" dur="3.72">the singing and of course other angels</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="3.51">some of those angels had joined in with</text>
  <text start="384.61" dur="3.63">melkor into his version and they were</text>
  <text start="386.38" dur="5.85">adding their voice to his and creating</text>
  <text start="388.24" dur="7.47">more chaos and evil and in doing so they</text>
  <text start="392.23" dur="6.03">became what was later the Balrog he may</text>
  <text start="395.71" dur="3.28">remember the giant demon of fire and</text>
  <text start="398.26" dur="2.86">might that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="398.99" dur="6.09">they recall demons a fire in like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.12" dur="7.14">what Balrog means the Balrog as they as</text>
  <text start="405.08" dur="5.73">they say as Gandalf says when Gandalf</text>
  <text start="408.26" dur="4.29">fights him it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s almost an even</text>
  <text start="410.81" dur="4.17">match and that&amp;#39;s why he was able to kill</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="4.62">Gandalf because he is basically an evil</text>
  <text start="414.98" dur="3.96">angel which takes on the form of a demon</text>
  <text start="417.17" dur="6.33">of might they don&amp;#39;t have to Sauron</text>
  <text start="418.94" dur="6.6">didn&amp;#39;t but they could in fact Sauron</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="5.55">preferred the the the the form of a</text>
  <text start="425.54" dur="6.32">vampire or a werewolf back in 1st and</text>
  <text start="429.05" dur="5.4">2nd age he was actually into that stuff</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="4.57">he featured pretty heavily in those days</text>
  <text start="434.45" dur="5.22">as well he was still a lieutenant he was</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="6.36">a big guy but not nowhere near like Vala</text>
  <text start="439.67" dur="5.49">level so when they finished the planet</text>
  <text start="442.79" dur="3.39">singing they they had created this thing</text>
  <text start="445.16" dur="2.67">and they looked at it and they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="3">no this is interesting some of the gods</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="3.24">and the angels are like I want to go</text>
  <text start="449.18" dur="3.93">down there and actually create you know</text>
  <text start="451.07" dur="4.44">hands on and be part of this experience</text>
  <text start="453.11" dur="6">right so they enter the spheres of the</text>
  <text start="455.51" dur="7.04">world they enter the planet and they</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="6.93">land on the planet called ardha right</text>
  <text start="462.55" dur="6.55">whereas in the grigory watcher story in</text>
  <text start="466.04" dur="5.85">the book of enoch which is you know in</text>
  <text start="469.1" dur="5.34">my opinion canonical Bible but in many</text>
  <text start="471.89" dur="4.08">people&amp;#39;s opinion it&amp;#39;s not canonical so</text>
  <text start="474.44" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s just an Apocrypha which means it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.97" dur="3.63">not it it&amp;#39;s not divinely inspired just</text>
  <text start="478.01" dur="4.83">the words of a man blah blah blah but</text>
  <text start="479.6" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s Noah&amp;#39;s grandpa ok so if you</text>
  <text start="482.84" dur="3.45">can believe all of the the stories in</text>
  <text start="485.12" dur="2.91">the Bible and you can believe that you</text>
  <text start="486.29" dur="3.06">know the generational trees and the</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="3.12">people&amp;#39;s names and everything else then</text>
  <text start="489.35" dur="3.24">Noah was a real person therefore his</text>
  <text start="491.15" dur="2.55">grandpa was a real person therefore he</text>
  <text start="492.59" dur="4.47">actually lived throughout some of this</text>
  <text start="493.7" dur="4.95">major history a history and he was able</text>
  <text start="497.06" dur="4.89">to record some of the events including</text>
  <text start="498.65" dur="6.45">things like giants and and the Nephilim</text>
  <text start="501.95" dur="4.86">which is a and and the elongated heads</text>
  <text start="505.1" dur="4.26">and all of that which which features</text>
  <text start="506.81" dur="4.08">throughout multiple cultures throughout</text>
  <text start="509.36" dur="4.92">history that were not connected it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.89" dur="6.27">weird right like the Egyptians the the I</text>
  <text start="514.28" dur="5.9">think it was the Aztecs there were</text>
  <text start="517.16" dur="9.27">others as well sorry allergies are back</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="7.49">anyway so point being is so terrible I</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="2.89">hate allergies I really do</text>
  <text start="527.67" dur="3.33">that golden still helps but it only</text>
  <text start="529.32" dur="5.13">helps really I don&amp;#39;t know three or four</text>
  <text start="531" dur="5.46">hours but the point being there are some</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="7.32">similarities you&amp;#39;ve already seen the</text>
  <text start="536.46" dur="6.84">pride before before well not necessarily</text>
  <text start="541.77" dur="3.99">before the fall you haven&amp;#39;t seen the</text>
  <text start="543.3" dur="5.19">fall yet but you&amp;#39;ve seen the pride sort</text>
  <text start="545.76" dur="5.49">of mark creation right and it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="548.49" dur="6.96">similar to what many people who believe</text>
  <text start="551.25" dur="5.72">in this alien in Nephilim theory many</text>
  <text start="555.45" dur="3.51">people there believe that God is</text>
  <text start="556.97" dur="3.64">experiencing everything through</text>
  <text start="558.96" dur="4.47">multiplicity right like he is one</text>
  <text start="560.61" dur="4.77">everything at all at the same time and</text>
  <text start="563.43" dur="3.57">he&amp;#39;s bored so he decided to split</text>
  <text start="565.38" dur="4.65">himself into everything that is and</text>
  <text start="567" dur="6">experience himself subjectively through</text>
  <text start="570.03" dur="4.32">all of the eyes at once right like can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="573" dur="3.06">really understand that but that&amp;#39;s as</text>
  <text start="574.35" dur="4.35">close as you can possibly get as a human</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="5.67">to try to grasp the concept because we</text>
  <text start="578.7" dur="9.12">can&amp;#39;t even really understand forever as</text>
  <text start="581.73" dur="9.15">humans like we can&amp;#39;t rami so continuing</text>
  <text start="587.82" dur="5.04">on the story right like melkor and the</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="4.68">other gods and the other angels are now</text>
  <text start="592.86" dur="5.79">on the planet they&amp;#39;re creating mountains</text>
  <text start="595.56" dur="4.23">are creating life no elves no humans yet</text>
  <text start="598.65" dur="4.68">but they&amp;#39;re creating you know animal</text>
  <text start="599.79" dur="5.7">life I think I think the intz were</text>
  <text start="603.33" dur="4.95">created at this point tree people in the</text>
  <text start="605.49" dur="6.12">movies and they were young in those days</text>
  <text start="608.28" dur="4.59">and not very you know active with others</text>
  <text start="611.61" dur="4.86">they were just kind of learning their</text>
  <text start="612.87" dur="5.1">own thing and maybe not a very energetic</text>
  <text start="616.47" dur="4.65">yet walking around a lot because they</text>
  <text start="617.97" dur="4.74">were slow I think to come to being and</text>
  <text start="621.12" dur="3.39">everybody was just having fun building</text>
  <text start="622.71" dur="5.52">stuff you know everyone added things in</text>
  <text start="624.51" dur="7.05">a melhor added an ice and iron and and</text>

  <text start="744.14" dur="6.42">of the Rings universe and trolls and</text>
  <text start="745.94" dur="7.11">ants and angels and gods and creation</text>
  <text start="750.56" dur="5.22">story that has many similarities to the</text>
  <text start="753.05" dur="4.61">you know the the Bible&amp;#39;s creation story</text>
  <text start="755.78" dur="5.94">right</text>
  <text start="757.66" dur="6.58">similar different different creation in</text>
  <text start="761.72" dur="4.83">in like singing verses like speaking it</text>
  <text start="764.24" dur="6.75">into being but similar right you know</text>
  <text start="766.55" dur="6.57">there was you know words and sort of</text>
  <text start="770.99" dur="6.66">spoken into power I guess spoken into</text>
  <text start="773.12" dur="5.52">existence or sung into existence i I see</text>
  <text start="777.65" dur="4.23">similarities there I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="778.64" dur="8.13">everyone else will and then continuing</text>
  <text start="781.88" dur="7.17">on the story some of the other gods I</text>
  <text start="786.77" dur="3.6">think the one that was I can&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="789.05" dur="3.97">our name but sort of centered around</text>
  <text start="790.37" dur="5.98">nature and stuff she was sort of a</text>
  <text start="793.02" dur="6.9">the green god she created these two</text>
  <text start="796.35" dur="5.64">trees and these two trees gave light to</text>
  <text start="799.92" dur="4.11">the whole planet one was golden and one</text>
  <text start="801.99" dur="5.52">was silver and when they mixed it</text>
  <text start="804.03" dur="6.15">created a third even better color and it</text>
  <text start="807.51" dur="4.47">had this aura of peace and serenity and</text>
  <text start="810.18" dur="3.87">happiness and it was like being around</text>
  <text start="811.98" dur="6.84">heaven it is heaven on earth literally</text>
  <text start="814.05" dur="6.39">is what they built on the planet and it</text>
  <text start="818.82" dur="2.73">was centered around these trees that was</text>
  <text start="820.44" dur="2.88">where they put their cities and their</text>
  <text start="821.55" dur="3.3">homes and everything else and eventually</text>
  <text start="823.32" dur="4.38">the elves some of the elves came to live</text>
  <text start="824.85" dur="5.82">there and the gods and the L and the</text>
  <text start="827.7" dur="5.55">Maya lived there with the elves and they</text>
  <text start="830.67" dur="4.14">all enjoyed the tree and I think if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="833.25" dur="3.12">remembering correctly melkor was jealous</text>
  <text start="834.81" dur="5.3">I think it was something but I think it</text>
  <text start="836.37" dur="8.16">was actually of the trees primarily and</text>
  <text start="840.11" dur="8.02">down the road he finally beat raised</text>
  <text start="844.53" dur="5.91">them he unleashes the giant spider</text>
  <text start="848.13" dur="3.78">ungoliant which is this weird chaos</text>
  <text start="850.44" dur="5.43">demon that sort of pops out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="851.91" dur="5.88">but almost as powerful as the gods are</text>
  <text start="855.87" dur="3.99">when she absorbs all of the power from</text>
  <text start="857.79" dur="5.76">the trees and sucks in their their their</text>
  <text start="859.86" dur="6.09">blood she grows powerful right and she</text>
  <text start="863.55" dur="4.77">actually fights melhor and he has to he</text>
  <text start="865.95" dur="3.96">has to call demons the Balrogs to whip</text>
  <text start="868.32" dur="4.23">her with fire to get her off of him and</text>
  <text start="869.91" dur="4.95">she she runs south and has babies and</text>
  <text start="872.55" dur="5.1">eventually those babies become she&amp;#39;ll up</text>
  <text start="874.86" dur="5.64">from the giant spider on the way to</text>
  <text start="877.65" dur="5.37">Mordor that fights and bites Frodo</text>
  <text start="880.5" dur="5.49">okay that&amp;#39;s one of ungoliant s--</text>
  <text start="883.02" dur="5.79">children many children just like the</text>
  <text start="885.99" dur="6.21">giant spiders in the the Hobbit movie if</text>
  <text start="888.81" dur="6.9">you&amp;#39;re following that so now you have</text>
  <text start="892.2" dur="5.31">these myriad evil creatures you have the</text>
  <text start="895.71" dur="3.78">safer places in the West you have the</text>
  <text start="897.51" dur="3.54">north which is like the cold north which</text>
  <text start="899.49" dur="7.29">is where he has hell and nobody really</text>
  <text start="901.05" dur="7.74">knows about it yet you have the south</text>
  <text start="906.78" dur="4.59">which has all the spiders and stuff and</text>
  <text start="908.79" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s elves spread throughout</text>
  <text start="911.37" dur="4.14">you know the continent it&amp;#39;s sort of like</text>
  <text start="913.53" dur="3.9">a European continent and there&amp;#39;s else</text>
  <text start="915.51" dur="5.41">spread throughout their different</text>
  <text start="917.43" dur="6.429">cultures start to develop and everything</text>
  <text start="920.92" dur="6.87">and when melhor finally betrays them and</text>
  <text start="923.859" dur="5.431">poisons the trees he and there was</text>
  <text start="927.79" dur="3">something else before this wood towers</text>
  <text start="929.29" dur="3.359">of ice and lamps that he screwed them</text>
  <text start="930.79" dur="4.099">over with - but they they kind of</text>
  <text start="932.649" dur="4.47">forgave him for that</text>
  <text start="934.889" dur="4.6">so when Melkor screwed the trees over</text>
  <text start="937.119" dur="6.18">poisoned them and basically destroyed</text>
  <text start="939.489" dur="5.491">the the heavenly light I think one of</text>
  <text start="943.299" dur="3.63">the fruit or something was saved and</text>
  <text start="944.98" dur="3.87">turned into the Sun by the gods and then</text>
  <text start="946.929" dur="5.94">he couldn&amp;#39;t get to space anymore so</text>
  <text start="948.85" dur="6.179">melhor was unable to to stop the Sun but</text>
  <text start="952.869" dur="4.171">he did still the three silmarils which</text>
  <text start="955.029" dur="4.89">of these three magic rocks created by</text>
  <text start="957.04" dur="8.069">like the best elf ever fene or who was a</text>
  <text start="959.919" dur="7.47">great craftsman and sort of a imperious</text>
  <text start="965.109" dur="4.65">asshole because he actually started a</text>
  <text start="967.389" dur="4.651">war and everything so melhor stole these</text>
  <text start="969.759" dur="3.961">three rocks these holy stones that burnt</text>
  <text start="972.04" dur="3.569">his hand because he was evil at this</text>
  <text start="973.72" dur="3.779">point he and he didn&amp;#39;t care he took him</text>
  <text start="975.609" dur="3.51">anyway and the the reason he got in the</text>
  <text start="977.499" dur="2.911">fight was she with on goalie off the</text>
  <text start="979.119" dur="2.64">spider is because she wanted to eat</text>

  <text start="985.509" dur="4.17">iron crown there&amp;#39;s a whole nother story</text>
  <text start="988.119" dur="2.91">about some money that actually sneaks in</text>

  <text start="1032.13" dur="3.09">their area with the trees and everything</text>
  <text start="1033.51" dur="4.169">into an island off to the west you can</text>
  <text start="1035.22" dur="4.709">think of it as America or something</text>
  <text start="1037.679" dur="3.96">just a big island way out in the water</text>
  <text start="1039.929" dur="3.99">to the west this is where the elves are</text>

  <text start="1054.48" dur="4.27">eventually they actually remove it from</text>
  <text start="1057.43" dur="2.34">the circles of the world which means</text>
  <text start="1058.75" dur="2.76">they make it so that you cannot</text>
  <text start="1059.77" dur="3.03">physically go there anymore and any elf</text>

  <text start="1221.56" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s it you know you attack Mordor</text>
  <text start="1224.04" dur="3.49">thousands of orcs and trolls come out</text>
  <text start="1226.15" dur="4.14">you attack this place thousands of</text>
  <text start="1227.53" dur="4.62">dragons come out okay so it&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="1230.29" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s the scale that we&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="1232.15" dur="4.02">here dragons could breathe fire they</text>
  <text start="1234.7" dur="4.59">couldn&amp;#39;t fly at first but they could</text>
  <text start="1236.17" dur="4.92">breathe fire and decimate elves and the</text>
  <text start="1239.29" dur="2.7">elves eventually brought in the dwarves</text>
  <text start="1241.09" dur="3">of Moria</text>
  <text start="1241.99" dur="3.69">which is the place that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="1244.09" dur="3.33">taken over by orcs and Balrogs</text>
  <text start="1245.68" dur="3.51">and they travel through working in Dolph</text>
  <text start="1247.42" dur="4.02">dies that big underground cave in the</text>
  <text start="1249.19" dur="4.11">movies they actually bring in the</text>
  <text start="1251.44" dur="4.07">dwarves of Moria the first dwarf</text>
  <text start="1253.3" dur="5.07">families you know those clans that were</text>
  <text start="1255.51" dur="5.29">actually created by Sal Ron&amp;#39;s former</text>
  <text start="1258.37" dur="4.23">boss the god of crafts because he was he</text>
  <text start="1260.8" dur="3.87">just wanted to like he wanted to help</text>
  <text start="1262.6" dur="3.93">right and arrow was like you know what</text>
  <text start="1264.67" dur="2.27">I&amp;#39;ll give them life but don&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="1266.53" dur="2.85">again</text>
  <text start="1266.94" dur="4.9">so the dwarves were sculpted from clay</text>
  <text start="1269.38" dur="4.35">but but breathed life into and they were</text>
  <text start="1271.84" dur="4.47">very resistant to fire and very you know</text>
  <text start="1273.73" dur="4.7">durable like the typical dwarf the heavy</text>
  <text start="1276.31" dur="7.18">armor resistant to flames underground</text>
  <text start="1278.43" dur="8.27">boisterous kind of paranoid alcoholic</text>
  <text start="1283.49" dur="4.74">those kind of dwarves you know and and</text>
  <text start="1286.7" dur="4.4">bearded and you never see the women they</text>
  <text start="1288.23" dur="4.949">look like the man with the beard I guess</text>
  <text start="1291.1" dur="3.61">they bring in those two words in those</text>
  <text start="1293.179" dur="3.331">Dwarfs are actually able to like fight</text>
  <text start="1294.71" dur="2.88">back versus dragons sometimes they can</text>
  <text start="1296.51" dur="4.32">resist the flames it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1297.59" dur="6.12">interesting so which later on of course</text>
  <text start="1300.83" dur="4.079">there&amp;#39;s a giant enmity between dragons</text>
  <text start="1303.71" dur="3.99">and dwarves look at what happened with</text>
  <text start="1304.909" dur="3.9">smog in the the Lonely Island where the</text>
  <text start="1307.7" dur="3.27">dwarves are trying to reclaim their</text>
  <text start="1308.809" dur="3.451">kingdom from the giant smile dragon</text>
  <text start="1310.97" dur="5.4">where he and then there&amp;#39;s the Hobbit</text>
  <text start="1312.26" dur="6.06">movie right so there&amp;#39;s that but the the</text>
  <text start="1316.37" dur="4.169">elves surround they have got him on all</text>
  <text start="1318.32" dur="5.219">sides the whole like basically United</text>
  <text start="1320.539" dur="4.951">Nations of elves and dwarves and at this</text>
  <text start="1323.539" dur="3.99">point there are humans helping on both</text>
  <text start="1325.49" dur="5.97">sides because when humans were born</text>
  <text start="1327.529" dur="5.431">later on then elves he corrupted some of</text>
  <text start="1331.46" dur="3.66">them to evil and these become the</text>
  <text start="1332.96" dur="4.8">Eastern humans later like the the Middle</text>
  <text start="1335.12" dur="4.08">Easterners that are serving Sauron in in</text>
  <text start="1337.76" dur="4.44">the movies with the giant Olaf on</text>
  <text start="1339.2" dur="5.28">elephants and the and the the darker</text>
  <text start="1342.2" dur="5.219">skin and the sell votes the Corsairs the</text>
  <text start="1344.48" dur="5.25">Pirates these are the evil humans right</text>
  <text start="1347.419" dur="3.87">and then there&amp;#39;s like the the</text>
  <text start="1349.73" dur="3.329">north-eastern ones that you&amp;#39;re like the</text>
  <text start="1351.289" dur="3.721">easterling&amp;#39;s and they&amp;#39;re not Middle</text>
  <text start="1353.059" dur="5.941">Eastern they&amp;#39;re just more like barbarian</text>
  <text start="1355.01" dur="5.549">jerks like Viking style and these guys</text>
  <text start="1359" dur="3.029">later on serfs outlaws so they serve</text>
  <text start="1360.559" dur="2.901">evil basically the whole time so there</text>
  <text start="1362.029" dur="3.75">is definitely some bad blood between</text>
  <text start="1363.46" dur="4.54">elves and humans but there are good</text>
  <text start="1365.779" dur="3.741">humans families that that serve</text>
  <text start="1368" dur="4.02">honorably and they win distinguishment</text>
  <text start="1369.52" dur="4.57">distinguishment for their for their for</text>
  <text start="1372.02" dur="3.6">their peoples and they even at some</text>
  <text start="1374.09" dur="3.87">point later on get rewarded their own</text>
  <text start="1375.62" dur="4.14">Island and like 800 lifes 800 year</text>
  <text start="1377.96" dur="4.589">lifespan and stuff when this is Numenor</text>
  <text start="1379.76" dur="4.889">and this actually is driven under the</text>
  <text start="1382.549" dur="4.831">sea by Sauron with with a huge</text>
  <text start="1384.649" dur="4.65">catastrophe curse because they tried to</text>
  <text start="1387.38" dur="4.11">go to he convinced them to try to take</text>
  <text start="1389.299" dur="4.86">over heaven later you know hundreds of</text>
  <text start="1391.49" dur="4.289">years later and then Numenor was</text>
  <text start="1394.159" dur="3.781">destroyed and the remnants of númenor</text>
  <text start="1395.779" dur="4.711">became dawn door and the ruminant of the</text>

  <text start="1419.86" dur="3.36">just watching at this point they do make</text>
  <text start="1421.75" dur="4.649">an appearance but they serve mine way</text>
  <text start="1423.22" dur="5.25">the the Zeus guy and he&amp;#39;s sort of like</text>

  <text start="1447.61" dur="5.34">out and he this is when he designs</text>

  <text start="1472.149" dur="3.061">whatever he is sitting there he&amp;#39;s ready</text>
  <text start="1473.74" dur="3.6">to do this</text>
  <text start="1475.21" dur="5.13">thousand years later suddenly one day</text>
  <text start="1477.34" dur="5.579">boom the the gates open and the hugest</text>
  <text start="1480.34" dur="6.03">horde just pours out of hell the</text>
  <text start="1482.919" dur="4.801">fortress above halloweenmart and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1486.37" dur="3">way worse than at the end of Lord of the</text>

  <text start="1489.37" dur="3.689">the sea of orcs and trolls it&amp;#39;s way</text>

  <text start="1493.059" dur="3.72">dragons for the first time never seen</text>
  <text start="1494.919" dur="4.5">before deadly effective fire-breathing</text>

  <text start="1499.419" dur="8.49">large lizards right fire-breathing</text>
  <text start="1503.799" dur="5.58">lizards heavily armored then the dwarves</text>
  <text start="1507.909" dur="3.36">are the only thing we can stand against</text>
  <text start="1509.379" dur="4.41">them and they when they&amp;#39;re distinguished</text>
  <text start="1511.269" dur="4.591">that way as well and they actually drive</text>
  <text start="1513.789" dur="3.541">back the leader of the Dragons and they</text>
  <text start="1515.86" dur="3.809">actually kind of save the day a little</text>
  <text start="1517.33" dur="3.809">bit but this battle it pay it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1519.669" dur="4.01">beginning of the ends the beginning of</text>
  <text start="1521.139" dur="4.711">the decline of this siege they are now</text>
  <text start="1523.679" dur="5.2">it&amp;#39;s going to be the beginning of a long</text>
  <text start="1525.85" dur="5.52">slow decline and we&amp;#39;ll get to that but</text>
  <text start="1528.879" dur="4.861">this battle is called the Battle of</text>
  <text start="1531.37" dur="4.58">unnumbered tiers I can&amp;#39;t move the elvish</text>

  <text start="1536.04" dur="7.21">anyway so the Battle of unnumbered tears</text>
  <text start="1539.79" dur="5.2">many many people were lost in this I</text>
  <text start="1543.25" dur="5.01">think&amp;#39;ll a drill was like a baby at this</text>
  <text start="1544.99" dur="8.46">time I think Elrond was like a minor</text>
  <text start="1548.26" dur="7.2">belt baby at this time poor young you</text>

  <text start="1577.429" dur="4.86">Baron are the ones that actually go into</text>
  <text start="1579.019" dur="7.08">hell disguised as of em I think of</text>
  <text start="1582.289" dur="5.37">Empire and a and a werewolf that killed</text>
  <text start="1586.099" dur="3.351">them and took their skin and disguise</text>
  <text start="1587.659" dur="4.32">themselves to get past the guards and</text>
  <text start="1589.45" dur="5.529">they went into hell and they stole back</text>
  <text start="1591.979" dur="5.19">one of the Silmarils because she she</text>

  <text start="1599.509" dur="4.02">gems out of the crown of the sleeping</text>
  <text start="1601.19" dur="5.069">mill poor really cool story and in fact</text>
  <text start="1603.529" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s a tragic tragedy story as well a</text>
  <text start="1606.259" dur="3.451">lot of that in The Lord of the Rings and</text>
  <text start="1608.119" dur="5.79">Silmarillion and you got to remember</text>
  <text start="1609.71" dur="6.809">Tolkien was like he wrote this like</text>
  <text start="1613.909" dur="4.08">during the war from the hospital bed</text>
  <text start="1616.519" dur="3.27">where he was sort of like stuck for</text>
  <text start="1617.989" dur="4.44">months you know he wrote a lot of this</text>
  <text start="1619.789" dur="4.59">to give his his pet language of history</text>
  <text start="1622.429" dur="4.59">right how much of this did he borrow</text>
  <text start="1624.379" dur="4.68">from from the stuff that he had already</text>
  <text start="1627.019" dur="3.39">known or researched like how much of a</text>
  <text start="1629.059" dur="5.131">scholar was he how much did he know</text>
  <text start="1630.409" dur="5.25">about the occult a lot of this stuff you</text>
  <text start="1634.19" dur="3.63">know how much of it is original thought</text>
  <text start="1635.659" dur="4.11">how much of it it was influenced by the</text>
  <text start="1637.82" dur="6.63">Book of Enoch for example over the fall</text>
  <text start="1639.769" dur="7.86">of Satan or things like that or the or</text>
  <text start="1644.45" dur="4.949">the war and the Nazis you know or even</text>
  <text start="1647.629" dur="8.1">just the geography of the book how it</text>
  <text start="1649.399" dur="7.98">kind of resembles Europe anyway so the</text>
  <text start="1655.729" dur="3.721">Battle of odd number tears they</text>
  <text start="1657.379" dur="5.01">basically retreat back to their kingdoms</text>
  <text start="1659.45" dur="4.26">and at this point for the next I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1662.389" dur="3.931">know I think a couple hundred years</text>
  <text start="1663.71" dur="5.339">Melkor is just breeding huge numbers of</text>
  <text start="1666.32" dur="4.769">orcs and smashing Kingdom after Kingdom</text>
  <text start="1669.049" dur="5.88">and then smashing Kingdom you know</text>
  <text start="1671.089" dur="4.861">slowly and the interesting thing is I</text>
  <text start="1674.929" dur="1.86">think it was during the Battle of</text>
  <text start="1675.95" dur="2.579">unnumbered tears</text>
  <text start="1676.789" dur="6.81">the elves actually had a chance to wipe</text>
  <text start="1678.529" dur="6.21">out every single last work forever but</text>
  <text start="1683.599" dur="2.88">they did they did fail to take the</text>
  <text start="1684.739" dur="4.23">chance because that some of them wanted</text>
  <text start="1686.479" dur="4.92">to survive I don&amp;#39;t know if that was the</text>
  <text start="1688.969" dur="4.02">Battle of under number tears or got the</text>
  <text start="1691.399" dur="2.76">fall of Gondolin which is a like a</text>

  <text start="1701.1" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;re starting to see the pattern at</text>
  <text start="1702.69" dur="5.57">this point Sal Iran has his own kingdom</text>

  <text start="1717.42" dur="3.02">that but he&amp;#39;s still pretty powerful</text>
  <text start="1722" dur="6.04">there are at this point there are good</text>
  <text start="1725.37" dur="5.46">angels among the elven kingdoms</text>
  <text start="1728.04" dur="5.04">sometimes like a well-known one was</text>

  <text start="1790.89" dur="4.14">a backstabbing and intrigue among these</text>
  <text start="1793.26" dur="3.99">kingdoms because that curse between the</text>
  <text start="1795.03" dur="4.7">sons of fien or that was always gonna be</text>
  <text start="1797.25" dur="5.549">there these gems became this sort of</text>
  <text start="1799.73" dur="4.99">everyone craved them so much that they</text>
  <text start="1802.799" dur="3.771">would kill their friends and family</text>
  <text start="1804.72" dur="4.709">almost it became sort of like the ring</text>
  <text start="1806.57" dur="5.109">later on in Lord of the Rings it became</text>
  <text start="1809.429" dur="4.141">something that it&amp;#39;s sort of best that it</text>
  <text start="1811.679" dur="4.531">just disappeared from the world because</text>
  <text start="1813.57" dur="4.68">everyone would fight over it even the</text>
  <text start="1816.21" dur="3.87">gods won it back right so they would try</text>
  <text start="1818.25" dur="3.84">to take it from you the elf kingdoms</text>
  <text start="1820.08" dur="5.339">were like nah my dad made this this is</text>
  <text start="1822.09" dur="6.089">mine I&amp;#39;ll kill you and and this this</text>
  <text start="1825.419" dur="3.931">this went on for quite a while so it did</text>
  <text start="1828.179" dur="4.791">it helped</text>
  <text start="1829.35" dur="7.7">Melkor to defeat the fragmented kingdoms</text>
  <text start="1832.97" dur="6.82">and down the road</text>
  <text start="1837.05" dur="4.15">Melkor was kicking so much but i guess</text>
  <text start="1839.79" dur="4.94">at some point i can&amp;#39;t remember what</text>
  <text start="1841.2" dur="8.13">triggered it i think it was one of the</text>
  <text start="1844.73" dur="6.73">humans I think actually made a trip to</text>
  <text start="1849.33" dur="4.32">heaven which is you&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="1851.46" dur="5.82">do as a human anyway to beg for help</text>
  <text start="1853.65" dur="5.25">mana way and the gods and all of the</text>
  <text start="1857.28" dur="3.21">elves that were still there and their</text>
  <text start="1858.9" dur="3.48">mighty host which were mightier than the</text>
  <text start="1860.49" dur="5.07">the the regular elf now because they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1862.38" dur="4.65">been decimated by years of war and all</text>
  <text start="1865.56" dur="2.94">of the army of eagles which are about</text>
  <text start="1867.03" dur="4.53">the size of the dragons so they fight</text>
  <text start="1868.5" dur="6.39">each other all of the the gods</text>
  <text start="1871.56" dur="5.64">themselves including tulkus the The</text>
  <text start="1874.89" dur="6.45">Wrestler God who basically is like a</text>
  <text start="1877.2" dur="7.35">giant with iron fists all of them they</text>
  <text start="1881.34" dur="5.4">they go to war they bring the hosts from</text>
  <text start="1884.55" dur="4.71">heaven all the way over to you Tom no in</text>
  <text start="1886.74" dur="4.59">England they smashed the eggman down</text>
  <text start="1889.26" dur="3.96">they they they crush the mountains into</text>
  <text start="1891.33" dur="3.12">pieces I mean there are still things</text>
  <text start="1893.22" dur="3.18">down there and they&amp;#39;re still tunnels</text>
  <text start="1894.45" dur="4.02">down there but basically it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="1896.4" dur="4.17">and they couldn&amp;#39;t get into you Tom know</text>
  <text start="1898.47" dur="4.14">down there where he was staying but they</text>
  <text start="1900.57" dur="3.6">they they tricked him into coming out</text>
  <text start="1902.61" dur="2.73">with his pride and then they beat the</text>
  <text start="1904.17" dur="3.03"> out of him and trapped him and</text>
  <text start="1905.34" dur="3.33">threw him in space basically through the</text>
  <text start="1907.2" dur="3.3">doors at night back in heaven so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1908.67" dur="3.42">basically like a portal out into space</text>
  <text start="1910.5" dur="2.99">you can&amp;#39;t come back trapped out there</text>
  <text start="1912.09" dur="4.2">forever cuz you&amp;#39;re immortal</text>
  <text start="1913.49" dur="4.15">and now all he can do is watch and wait</text>
  <text start="1916.29" dur="3.3">and try to influence things from outside</text>
  <text start="1917.64" dur="4.77">so he&amp;#39;s no longer physically in the</text>
  <text start="1919.59" dur="5.1">sphere which is sort of like Satan right</text>
  <text start="1922.41" dur="4.47">the the pride the fall and now the</text>
  <text start="1924.69" dur="3.57">influence from behind the scenes now in</text>
  <text start="1926.88" dur="4.11">the movie of course he still has his</text>
  <text start="1928.26" dur="4.59">lieutenant Sauron and Sauron still hopes</text>
  <text start="1930.99" dur="5.22">to like one day bring him back home</text>
  <text start="1932.85" dur="5.43">Sauron is like a loyal lieutenant of</text>
  <text start="1936.21" dur="3.63">Melkor and maybe at the later era he</text>
  <text start="1938.28" dur="5.43">wants to try to just a chief power for</text>
  <text start="1939.84" dur="6.04">himself but given the chance</text>
  <text start="1943.71" dur="4.45">Sauron would welcome melhor back</text>
  <text start="1945.88" dur="3.539">so the only way to do that I think</text>
  <text start="1948.16" dur="3.12">theoretically would be to take over</text>
  <text start="1949.419" dur="3.63">heaven itself and that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1951.28" dur="2.63">something beyond Sauron even if he took</text>
  <text start="1953.049" dur="5.431">over middle-earth</text>
  <text start="1953.91" dur="6.49">so this giant battle then all most of</text>
  <text start="1958.48" dur="3.809">the dragons were killed by the the giant</text>
  <text start="1960.4" dur="3.57">Eagles losses were vicious on both sides</text>
  <text start="1962.289" dur="3.571">but the gods</text>
  <text start="1963.97" dur="4.23">you know nothing could stand against all</text>
  <text start="1965.86" dur="5.67">of them together they chained him up</text>
  <text start="1968.2" dur="6.9">they threw him out in space fast forward</text>
  <text start="1971.53" dur="5.759">you know a few thousand years the gods</text>
  <text start="1975.1" dur="4.079">are pretty much not active anymore like</text>
  <text start="1977.289" dur="4.221">Olmo the god of the sea kind of listens</text>
  <text start="1979.179" dur="4.86">through the streams but that&amp;#39;s it and</text>
  <text start="1981.51" dur="3.73">they&amp;#39;ve pretty much like we don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1984.039" dur="2.341">about the planet anymore it&amp;#39;s too much</text>
  <text start="1985.24" dur="4.38">pain we don&amp;#39;t want to deal with it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1986.38" dur="4.65">just stay in heaven and the elf</text>
  <text start="1989.62" dur="2.88">sometimes will occasionally try to go</text>
  <text start="1991.03" dur="3.389">back to heaven they&amp;#39;re like I&amp;#39;m tired of</text>
  <text start="1992.5" dur="5.58">the tears it you know we&amp;#39;re fading</text>
  <text start="1994.419" dur="5.671">anyway and you get into the stories of</text>
  <text start="1998.08" dur="4.02">the Lord of the Rings and the age of man</text>
