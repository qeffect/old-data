  <text start="13.23" dur="3.45">been doing lately I&amp;#39;m going to go</text>
  <text start="14.19" dur="3.9">through a complement or two of our</text>
  <text start="16.68" dur="4.95">president and then I&amp;#39;ll jump into the</text>

  <text start="31.109" dur="3.871">the Democrats want to just get rid of</text>
  <text start="32.46" dur="5.4">completely federal agents have seized</text>

  <text start="76.83" dur="5.55">entire election so I&amp;#39;m very much hopeful</text>
  <text start="80.79" dur="4.619">that she will actually face jail time</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="5.82">and not just be allowed to resign in</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="4.591">shame only to be replaced by someone</text>

  <text start="229.81" dur="5.88">evaluations go to something more normal</text>
  <text start="231.76" dur="6.06">and more sensible so I do expect you</text>

  <text start="265.45" dur="3.529">how it goes</text>
  <text start="266.639" dur="6">having some solar in my opinion still a</text>
  <text start="268.979" dur="5.91">better deal than gold you know the the</text>
  <text start="272.639" dur="2.851">the ratio is over eighty to one right</text>
  <text start="274.889" dur="2.371">now</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="4.8">Alyce&amp;#39;s of silver to one ounce of gold</text>
  <text start="277.26" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s generally speaking it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="280.29" dur="3.33">supposed to be like that it&amp;#39;s supposed</text>
  <text start="281.22" dur="6.63">to be closer to sixteen or less there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="6.15">a lot of manipulation going on in the</text>
  <text start="287.85" dur="3.9">markets right now with you know the gold</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="3.45">and silver and the Kryptos if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="4.62">paying decrypt paying attention to</text>
  <text start="293.22" dur="6.12">Kryptos some of these coins like for</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="4.35">example you know Bitcoin or litecoin or</text>
  <text start="299.34" dur="3.81">something some of the more popular coins</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="4.71">if you look at the daily trading volume</text>
  <text start="303.15" dur="4.29">on some of these exchanges don&amp;#39;t move</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="3.66">through a large portion if not the</text>
  <text start="307.44" dur="3.3">entirety of the entire available</text>
  <text start="309.09" dur="3.35">quantity of coins it&amp;#39;s not like everyone</text>
  <text start="310.74" dur="4.26">who has them or selling them every day</text>
  <text start="312.44" dur="6.729">it&amp;#39;s that a few big guys are going back</text>
  <text start="315" dur="6.66">and forth doing you know huge volumes of</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="4.891">small trades maybe even between their</text>
  <text start="321.66" dur="4.35">own accounts at a loss you know a small</text>
  <text start="324.06" dur="5.31">loss because it is a cheap way to</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="5.49">suppress the price of cryptos there has</text>
  <text start="329.37" dur="5.7">been a bloodbath in kryptos in the last</text>
  <text start="331.5" dur="5.729">few days down bitcoins down to 4500 it</text>
  <text start="335.07" dur="6.21">was around I don&amp;#39;t remember about 6300</text>
  <text start="337.229" dur="6.541">not too long ago so obviously you know</text>
  <text start="341.28" dur="4.35">you can freak out sell panic selling</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="3.48">emotional selling or you can look at</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="4.95">this as an opportunity to get things</text>
  <text start="347.25" dur="5.31">cheaper everything&amp;#39;s on sale Silver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.58" dur="3.839">below the cost it takes to make silver I</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="3.41">think bitcoin is getting close to that</text>
  <text start="354.419" dur="3.661">if it&amp;#39;s not already hit that mark</text>
  <text start="355.97" dur="5.11">they&amp;#39;ll never probably be this cheap</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="5.79">again other than you know emotional</text>
  <text start="361.08" dur="6.059">moments of fear where people are going</text>
  <text start="363.87" dur="5.13">to be jumping over the ship to try to</text>
  <text start="367.139" dur="4.321">save themselves it&amp;#39;s really an</text>
  <text start="369" dur="4.38">investment world as a long-term world</text>
  <text start="371.46" dur="3.329">and don&amp;#39;t let emotion crowd out your</text>
  <text start="373.38" dur="2.94">judgment it&amp;#39;s all I would say there</text>
  <text start="374.789" dur="5.041">obviously I can&amp;#39;t get financial advice</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="4.14">or or anything else but don&amp;#39;t you bank</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="3.24">is scary</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="5.7">do what you think is very scary whether</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="4.77">you choose crypto to silver gold toilet</text>

  <text start="396.789" dur="5.201">you know fall of Rome but with improved</text>
  <text start="399.86" dur="3.809">and better quality technology so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="401.99" dur="2.519">think we&amp;#39;ll have actual starvation but</text>
  <text start="403.669" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;ll see how it goes</text>
  <text start="404.509" dur="4.95">things will get pinched for people for a</text>
  <text start="407.869" dur="4.08">long time</text>
  <text start="409.459" dur="3.93">but I also like I said it&amp;#39;s the only way</text>
  <text start="411.949" dur="3.9">to get rid of the Federal Reserve System</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s what Trump seems to be doing and</text>
  <text start="415.849" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s a necessary painful experience you</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="4.59">know we&amp;#39;ve been on that free money low</text>
  <text start="420.409" dur="4.68">interest money drug for a long time and</text>
  <text start="423.409" dur="4.35">we need to hit rock bottom we need to go</text>
  <text start="425.089" dur="5.28">through withdrawal that&amp;#39;s the tough love</text>
  <text start="427.759" dur="6.06">honest approach that politicians can</text>
  <text start="430.369" dur="6.53">never tell you you know they start they</text>
  <text start="433.819" dur="6.6">start threatening one inch of people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.899" dur="7.27">handouts and suddenly you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="440.419" dur="6.571">huge risk you guys can&amp;#39;t even see my my</text>
  <text start="444.169" dur="5.67">camera right now so suddenly it&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="446.99" dur="4.489">huge risk of popularity because if you</text>
  <text start="449.839" dur="5.67">left of the food stamps or you go after</text>
  <text start="451.479" dur="5.86">you know the entitlements I know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.509" dur="2.821">not a popular word but you go after any</text>
  <text start="457.339" dur="2.37">of these things saying look we just</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="2.85">can&amp;#39;t afford them people will just</text>
  <text start="459.709" dur="3.151">immediately vote you out and voting the</text>

  <text start="462.86" dur="6.239">afford them even if they&amp;#39;re lying</text>
  <text start="464.719" dur="9.09">because people they prefer a comfortable</text>
  <text start="469.099" dur="5.91">truth rather than an uncomfortable lie a</text>
  <text start="473.809" dur="2.73">comfortable live weather than an</text>
  <text start="475.009" dur="4.2">uncomfortable truth yeah that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="476.539" dur="4.98">trying to say anyway</text>

  <text start="491.719" dur="3.211">just jump over to the house or to the</text>
  <text start="493.129" dur="3.18">Senate at some point because the</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="4.379">Democrats have power in the house you</text>
