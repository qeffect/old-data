  <text start="26.699" dur="4.291">kind of around for a while but at one</text>
  <text start="29.01" dur="5.91">point at least within the QED community</text>
  <text start="30.99" dur="6.21">this was a big research topic and here</text>

  <text start="56.37" dur="5.04">professor the academic who told George</text>

  <text start="70.799" dur="5.371">you last minute we appreciate it the</text>
  <text start="72.54" dur="5.73">breaking news rather than me I have the</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="4.41">full copy of your letter right here but</text>
  <text start="78.27" dur="6.029">rather than me explaining it I think we</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="6.84">best have you did well it&amp;#39;s great that</text>
  <text start="84.299" dur="6.061">you you remembering the story and if you</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="5.909">recall after the Moller report which I</text>
  <text start="90.36" dur="4.29">call the molar dossier came out I said</text>
  <text start="93.329" dur="3.72">that we were going to comb through it</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="6.329">one of the first things that we found is</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="8.971">they used a news report a Guardian news</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="9.481">report to claim that the link campus was</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="6.45">a place where Mifsud had worked what</text>
  <text start="110.46" dur="6.47">they failed to say in that same report</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="8.67">is that Massoud was actually related to</text>
  <text start="116.93" dur="6.28">Italian intelligence services so you</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="3.869">can&amp;#39;t if your molar you don&amp;#39;t get to</text>
  <text start="123.21" dur="3.93">just report part of what you want in the</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="3.78">story you have to put the entire piece</text>
  <text start="127.14" dur="3.929">before the American people he didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="4.541">that so we&amp;#39;re calling him out this is</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="4.781">not how investigations are suppose</text>
  <text start="133.33" dur="5.19">to be run when you look into Mifsud</text>
  <text start="135.85" dur="4.47">closer professor left said closer you</text>
  <text start="138.52" dur="4.83">realize that he is connected with all</text>
  <text start="140.32" dur="6.3">kinds of intelligence agencies include</text>
  <text start="143.35" dur="5.58">our own FBI and in that letter Shawn</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;ll see there&amp;#39;s pictures with FBI</text>
  <text start="148.93" dur="6.15">agents at the linked campus where</text>
  <text start="151.21" dur="5.7">Professor Mifsud teaches at so we ask</text>
  <text start="155.08" dur="4.47">the question and I&amp;#39;ll just get to the</text>
  <text start="156.91" dur="5.79">I&amp;#39;ll sum it up like this we want to know</text>
  <text start="159.55" dur="6.12">every document that these agencies had</text>
  <text start="162.7" dur="5.85">related to him it&amp;#39;s because if he is in</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="5.52">fact a Russian agent this would be one</text>
  <text start="168.55" dur="4.74">of the biggest intelligence scandals for</text>
  <text start="171.19" dur="4.41">not only the United States but also our</text>
  <text start="173.29" dur="4.56">allies like the Italians and the Brits</text>
  <text start="175.6" dur="5.28">and others because if Mifsud is a</text>
  <text start="177.85" dur="5.4">Russian agent he would know all kinds of</text>
  <text start="180.88" dur="5.85">our intelligence agents throughout the</text>
  <text start="183.25" dur="5.42">globe so we ask those questions we want</text>
  <text start="186.73" dur="7.02">those documents were giving them a week</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="7.99">you said that this professor has you</text>
  <text start="193.75" dur="4.26">know all these connections I just got to</text>
  <text start="196.66" dur="6.72">say I love how he added and we&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="7.59">him a week to other Western Intel and</text>
  <text start="203.38" dur="5.37">governments and yeah the issue about</text>
  <text start="205.6" dur="6.09">Russia which Muller implies he was a</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="5.1">Russian agent but it may be much deeper</text>
  <text start="211.69" dur="5.46">as how I&amp;#39;m seeing this and my question</text>
  <text start="213.85" dur="7.68">to you is do you believe in an effort to</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="8.16">illegally spy or get intelligence on the</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="6.17">American people that it&amp;#39;s possible that</text>
  <text start="225.31" dur="6.57">some at the top of our intelligence</text>
  <text start="227.7" dur="6.52">chain community under Obama Biden that</text>
  <text start="231.88" dur="5.13">they may have outsourced things that</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="6">were illegal for them to do to Americans</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="5.4">so that they could have our allies do</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="5.489">the spying for them like let me give you</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="6.99">an example Great Britain or Australia or</text>
  <text start="245.709" dur="5.221">maybe Italy I feel like New Zealand&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="3.99">gonna pop up in a second he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="5.04">about five eyes of course and just so</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="4.92">everyone remembers credit where it&amp;#39;s due</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="4.049">the queuing on movement and queuing on</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="4.44">himself has been hinting at five eyes</text>
  <text start="260.019" dur="4.381">for a quite a while way before anyone</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="3.78">else in the media had picked up on it</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="4.11">just so that we&amp;#39;re fair about that</text>
  <text start="266.53" dur="3.6">obvi obviously many people have many</text>
  <text start="268.51" dur="3.75">different opinions in the queue thing I</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="4.74">think it&amp;#39;s real I think I&amp;#39;m optimistic</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="4.23">about the plan overall but I realized</text>
  <text start="274.87" dur="3.21">that if you&amp;#39;re not painting close close</text>
  <text start="276.49" dur="3.72">close attention to everything going on</text>
  <text start="278.08" dur="3.42">every day you could miss some things and</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="4.08">maybe it would seem like nothing&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="281.5" dur="5.19">done just a quick reminder of course</text>
  <text start="284.29" dur="4.02">we&amp;#39;re now getting arrests okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="6.63">starting to see that happen now as well</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="7.17">so of course I&amp;#39;m talking about her and</text>
  <text start="293.32" dur="9">her name escapes me right as I needed of</text>
  <text start="295.48" dur="11.31">course Mellie or of course I think I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="302.32" dur="6.81">my over the target here I think you are</text>
  <text start="306.79" dur="4.68">and and one of the things that we point</text>
  <text start="309.13" dur="5.37">out in the letter is we&amp;#39;re very specific</text>
  <text start="311.47" dur="6.9">because the FBI or I should say the</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="6.18">Moller group claims that Papadopoulos</text>
  <text start="318.37" dur="4.68">misled them and they were not allowed to</text>
  <text start="320.68" dur="4.56">get to Professor Mifsud in time in order</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="4.92">to to interview him this is the claims</text>
  <text start="325.24" dur="6.42">that they make against Papadopoulos when</text>
  <text start="327.97" dur="6.06">they sentence him to prison now what we</text>
  <text start="331.66" dur="4.62">found is we&amp;#39;ll wait a second if if this</text>
  <text start="334.03" dur="4.139">really happened and if you backtrack all</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="4.889">this and they&amp;#39;re basically making the</text>
  <text start="338.169" dur="5.101">claim that Mifsud is the guy who said he</text>
  <text start="341.169" dur="3.901">had emails or he knew of the information</text>
  <text start="343.27" dur="4.41">about the emails being in the hands of</text>
  <text start="345.07" dur="5.37">the Russian government if that is in</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="6.2">fact true they couldn&amp;#39;t talk to Mifsud</text>
  <text start="350.44" dur="7.91">supposedly until January February of</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="7.99">2017 well how do they know to ask</text>
  <text start="358.35" dur="6.7">Papadopoulos all through 2016 whether or</text>
  <text start="361.87" dur="4.94">not he&amp;#39;s seen the Russian emails or</text>
  <text start="365.05" dur="4.59">whether he knows about Russian emails</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="4">the only way that&amp;#39;s possible is that had</text>
  <text start="369.64" dur="4.529">to come from Mifsud</text>
  <text start="370.81" dur="5.82">some way somehow so I think there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.169" dur="3.991">more likely that I&amp;#39;m going to be as</text>
  <text start="376.63" dur="4.89">starting Center on an NBA basketball</text>
  <text start="378.16" dur="5.73">team before Mifsud is a Russian secret</text>
  <text start="381.52" dur="5.25">Russian agent now who else is working</text>
  <text start="383.89" dur="4.77">for I don&amp;#39;t know but right now Sean like</text>
  <text start="386.77" dur="4.2">everything we&amp;#39;ve had to do we have to be</text>
  <text start="388.66" dur="4.56">slow inpatient we have to get the</text>
  <text start="390.97" dur="3.81">information because we need to see what</text>
  <text start="393.22" dur="4.65">exactly was the relationship between</text>
  <text start="394.78" dur="5.34">Massoud and our FBI myths hood and our</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="4.32">State Department that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="3.96">said in our intelligence community you</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="3">know by the way I wish I thought of this</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="4.14">myself I&amp;#39;m kind of jealous</text>
  <text start="405.19" dur="4.85">the Muller dossier which is interesting</text>
  <text start="408.22" dur="4.44">but you specifically talk about</text>
  <text start="410.04" dur="6.48">omissions in the special counsels report</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="5.88">and you also talked about the explain a</text>
  <text start="416.52" dur="5.02">Papadopoulos net Mifsud</text>
  <text start="418.54" dur="4.59">now here&amp;#39;s the thing congressman I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="421.54" dur="6.57">gonna happen to Papadopoulos and his</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="7.92">wife on and the story in the tale that</text>
  <text start="428.11" dur="4.8">we now know is true even the New York</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="3.27">Times I think trying to get ahead of it</text>
  <text start="432.91" dur="2.91">because they know what&amp;#39;s coming out I</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t know how long you knew but you</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="5.4">didn&amp;#39;t tell me and I wish you did but</text>
  <text start="438.1" dur="6.36">they were using you know a young pretty</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="6.21">flirtatious woman in this equation right</text>
  <text start="444.46" dur="7.5">out of a you know a James Bond novel or</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="6.48">movie to set Papadopoulos up along with</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="3.329">Stefan how far along with this professor</text>
  <text start="453.91" dur="3.629">is there anything I&amp;#39;m saying that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.289" dur="3.901">wrong and how deep did it go well I</text>
  <text start="457.539" dur="4.471">can&amp;#39;t tell you I said this a year ago</text>
  <text start="459.19" dur="5.25">and and I got mocked and others got</text>
  <text start="462.01" dur="4.83">mocked I said look I&amp;#39;m not interested if</text>
  <text start="464.44" dur="4.8">if the Trump campaign was spied on that</text>
  <text start="466.84" dur="5.639">happened that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fact I want to</text>
  <text start="469.24" dur="5.46">know how many spies informants whatever</text>
  <text start="472.479" dur="5.461">you want to call them will run into the</text>
  <text start="474.7" dur="6.45">Trump campaign so look the New York</text>
  <text start="477.94" dur="6.03">Times story right now says - that&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="4.26">from from one my guess is it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="483.97" dur="3.39">more than that if you listen to what</text>
  <text start="485.41" dur="5.49">Attorney General Barr said yesterday as</text>
  <text start="487.36" dur="6.21">sophisticated as this operation was to</text>
  <text start="490.9" dur="5.28">have a FISA warrant on someone there had</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="4.65">to be a lot more involvement considering</text>
  <text start="496.18" dur="4.08">the the type of people the level of</text>
  <text start="498.22" dur="4.89">people that were involved in this</text>
  <text start="500.26" dur="4.5">investigation from our own FBI so my</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="4.23">guess is I&amp;#39;m still holding to what I</text>
  <text start="504.76" dur="4.68">said a year ago I want to know how many</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="4.139">spies were run into the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="509.44" dur="3.45">and I still don&amp;#39;t know but we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="511.479" dur="3.151">get the answer and we&amp;#39;re gonna get out</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="4.26">to the American people I count three</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="4.2">instances when you include FISA but</text>
  <text start="517.15" dur="3.329">thank you for being with us congressman</text>
  <text start="518.83" dur="6.35">please don&amp;#39;t stop what you&amp;#39;re doing this</text>
  <text start="520.479" dur="4.701">is too important to the foundational</text>
  <text start="525.52" dur="5.1">I can only assume that all of the</text>
  <text start="528.91" dur="6.29">pessimism that I see out there is a</text>
  <text start="530.62" dur="7.23">result of not seeing what I&amp;#39;m seeing or</text>
  <text start="535.2" dur="5.92">false information being spread around by</text>
  <text start="537.85" dur="4.71">the fake manga they like to throw in a</text>
  <text start="541.12" dur="3.18">lot of pessimism when there&amp;#39;s reason to</text>
  <text start="542.56" dur="5.13">be very optimistic I&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="544.3" dur="6.72">pattern I kind of equate those guys at</text>
  <text start="547.69" dur="5.28">this point to anglerfish Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="551.02" dur="4.62">himself you know they dangle off that</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="6.75">light you know the scary fish in the</text>
  <text start="555.64" dur="6.27">horror kind of sci-fi movies they dangle</text>
  <text start="559.72" dur="4.53">off that light and then all the little</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="4.59">fish come to nibble on it and then they</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="4.32">eat them the big monster pops out and</text>
  <text start="566.5" dur="4.23">that little light of course is the truth</text>
  <text start="568.57" dur="4.43">that they tell and that big monster is</text>
  <text start="570.73" dur="7.68">the lies that they make send with it and</text>
  <text start="573" dur="7.779">I&amp;#39;m starting to to see that that problem</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="6.299">is being greatly underestimated them on</text>
  <text start="580.779" dur="5.721">our side that that problem of deceivers</text>
  <text start="584.709" dur="3.901">and Judas figures within our movement</text>
  <text start="586.5" dur="3.49">betrayers you know the people that</text>
  <text start="588.61" dur="2.849">woulda let and that would left the</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="3">Trojan horse and the people that are</text>
  <text start="591.459" dur="5.281">building the damn thing in many cases</text>
  <text start="592.99" dur="7.08">are within our own side and of course by</text>
  <text start="596.74" dur="4.71">side I Trump supporters nationalist</text>
  <text start="600.07" dur="4.259">conservatives whatever you want to call</text>
  <text start="601.45" dur="5.759">it really the only sides I&amp;#39;m concerned</text>
  <text start="604.329" dur="6.241">about anymore or good versus evil but I</text>
  <text start="607.209" dur="4.431">see that those on conservative team who</text>
  <text start="610.57" dur="4.8">are spreading disinformation</text>
  <text start="611.64" dur="5.139">intentionally are really evil and I hope</text>
  <text start="615.37" dur="3.23">that more will come around to that but I</text>
  <text start="616.779" dur="4.591">will continue to expose them and</text>
  <text start="618.6" dur="4.33">obviously if you&amp;#39;re watching even Fox at</text>
  <text start="621.37" dur="3.29">this point and you&amp;#39;re paying attention</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="3.899">there&amp;#39;s great reason to be optimistic</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="3.1">these guys are talking about trees and</text>
  <text start="626.829" dur="3.691">they&amp;#39;re talking about some pretty</text>
