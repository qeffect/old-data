  <text start="126.479" dur="3.75">suspicious and then they come back and</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="4.441">they then they attack with threats and</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="4.441">everything else and ridicule and and</text>
  <text start="132.9" dur="3.15">then they have you know the media</text>
  <text start="134.67" dur="2.52">teaching them how to wipe their Twitter</text>

  <text start="145.379" dur="4.47">anyway as long as I can eat even if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="4.26">just bread and water but I could use the</text>
  <text start="149.849" dur="3.541">support I could use the energy because</text>
  <text start="152.01" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s all money really is and if you</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="3.78">give it to me I&amp;#39;m gonna use it for good</text>
  <text start="155.43" dur="3.12">it&amp;#39;s that simple I don&amp;#39;t really have</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="4.26">much else to do in my life and just sit</text>
  <text start="158.55" dur="5.46">here and fight for good so anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.43" dur="4.74">it for me donar boxed out of work /</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="3.99">Dustin Deimos and it&amp;#39;s better than</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="3.899">patreon tell your favorite influencers</text>
  <text start="168" dur="3.93">about that because patreon takes eight</text>
  <text start="170.069" dur="3.571">percent I think in donor boxes like</text>
  <text start="171.93" dur="3.36">three percent so it&amp;#39;s much more</text>
  <text start="173.64" dur="3.45">affordable for influencers and and</text>
  <text start="175.29" dur="3.99">patreon is an immoral company that</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="4.44">censors truth-tellers of course so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="4.02">trying to shift away from patreon to</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="4.08">donor box and it gives you a better deal</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="5.87">gives you more options a little bit</text>
  <text start="185.61" dur="5.82">simpler and you can plug it in also</text>
  <text start="189.17" dur="5.679">right right into your website and such</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="6.93">which is neat and you know it allows us</text>
  <text start="194.849" dur="4.89">to to have a way around patreon if you</text>
