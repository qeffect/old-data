  <text start="0.65" dur="4.3">hey guys welcome back this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="3.27" dur="4.2">emos and I have some interesting</text>
  <text start="4.95" dur="5.49">information about the Bitcoin market so</text>
  <text start="7.47" dur="4.35">this is just for people that that follow</text>
  <text start="10.44" dur="5.699">my videos that are interested in the</text>
  <text start="11.82" dur="5.82">crypto stuff that said if you&amp;#39;ll if</text>
  <text start="16.139" dur="4.351">you&amp;#39;re following things especially if</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="6.03">you own Bitcoin not long ago a couple</text>
  <text start="20.49" dur="5.52">months back we have that big slump where</text>
  <text start="23.67" dur="4.949">everything just tanked the market just</text>
  <text start="26.01" dur="5.849">crushed down and it seemed like it was</text>
  <text start="28.619" dur="5.091">the end of the world for Bitcoin as I</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="5.61">explained in other videos that was a</text>
  <text start="33.71" dur="5.619">combination of the massive dump of</text>
  <text start="37.469" dur="5.421">millions of dollars of Bitcoin all at</text>
  <text start="39.329" dur="6.331">once by the former mount GOx trustee</text>
  <text start="42.89" dur="5.38">this was an exchange that got hacked and</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="4.44">anyway long story short they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="48.27" dur="3.96">liquidating and the trustee is just</text>
  <text start="50.1" dur="5.4">dumping it on the open market which is a</text>
  <text start="52.23" dur="5.43">large quantity which temporarily plays</text>
  <text start="55.5" dur="4.26">with the supply and demand and distorts</text>
  <text start="57.66" dur="3.809">it and drive to the price down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="59.76" dur="4.829">actually a really good time to buy in my</text>
  <text start="61.469" dur="5.281">opinion and also the Google the Facebook</text>
  <text start="64.589" dur="6.001">and the Twitter bands on crypto</text>
  <text start="66.75" dur="5.6">advertising so you have the baby you</text>
  <text start="70.59" dur="6.84">have the big three tech companies</text>
  <text start="72.35" dur="7.54">blocking cryptocurrencies in a very</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="4.229">effective way because it&amp;#39;s hard to get</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="3.6">the word out about new businesses on</text>
  <text start="81.659" dur="3.57">that in that space and create a new buzz</text>
  <text start="83.49" dur="8.19">and excitement when they&amp;#39;re censoring</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="8.761">all ads so there is a precedent where as</text>
  <text start="91.68" dur="5.07">soon as he did this and that other the</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="4.53">bad news factor definitely contributed</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="3.81">but as soon as he did this he sold all</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="4.559">these Bitcoin the market just tanked I</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="6.15">mean Bitcoin was near 20,000 back down</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="6.091">to like 6,000 so and these are just</text>
  <text start="106.71" dur="5.85">general numbers from memory but he</text>
  <text start="109.17" dur="5.22">basically drove the whole market down</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="3.93">temporarily and that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="4.68">very small market still only 1% of the</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="4.409">world even uses crypto I mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.07" dur="3.96">hundreds of billions of dollar market</text>
  <text start="120.899" dur="3.72">but compared to some things like</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="4.229">compared to what it will be one day or</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="5.221">what it could be which is hundreds of</text>
  <text start="127.259" dur="5.791">trillions of dollars Bitcoin is a tiny</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="3.51">market so sometimes people like that who</text>
  <text start="133.05" dur="4.14">are</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="5.34">Wales will make an impact they&amp;#39;ll submit</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;ll make a big splash they&amp;#39;re called</text>
  <text start="138.69" dur="4.65">Wales because they have a large chunk of</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="6.08">whatever crypto that they&amp;#39;re in and they</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="6.6">have the ability to sort of make waves</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="5.14">that said whatever he does is temporary</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="4.74">that the market of course as you see now</text>
  <text start="152.19" dur="6.71">goes back up but now that it has gone</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="7.2">back up this guy has a responsibility to</text>
  <text start="158.9" dur="5.56">sell these things as a trustee to get</text>
  <text start="161.88" dur="3.63">the highest price possible to compensate</text>
  <text start="164.46" dur="3.96">the people that are getting their money</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="4.35">back so he is waiting for the market to</text>
  <text start="168.42" dur="1.83">go back up and he&amp;#39;s just gonna do it</text>
  <text start="169.86" dur="2.43">again</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="3.84">and I mentioned this a while back this</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="5.1">is an opportunity for people who are</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="6.06">savvy to to ride that up and down which</text>
  <text start="177.39" dur="4.77">is someone predictable it&amp;#39;s gonna build</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="3.45">back up and then he&amp;#39;s gonna take it and</text>
  <text start="182.16" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s gonna keep happening until he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="5.7">outta Bitcoin so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of a</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="4.65">gift because most people don&amp;#39;t pay think</text>
  <text start="189.3" dur="4.02">that close attention to things this is a</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="4.26">great opportunity to make money at the</text>
  <text start="193.32" dur="4.68">very least you&amp;#39;ll know that there are</text>
  <text start="195.93" dur="4.65">some buying opportunities in the future</text>
  <text start="198" dur="4.56">if you want to get into Bitcoin but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="200.58" dur="4.41">also going to include a link for you</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="4.11">guys below for a very interesting thing</text>
  <text start="204.99" dur="4.44">and I&amp;#39;ve been kind of building up to</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="6.03">this it turns out that that trustee I</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="6.57">mentioned of the defunct Tokyo exchange</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="5.07">Mount Cox has shifted recently a hundred</text>
  <text start="216" dur="3.81">and seventy million dollars worth of</text>
  <text start="217.77" dur="5.49">Bitcoin now that depending on the day</text>
  <text start="219.81" dur="6.24">can change a lot and Bitcoin cash so</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="5.7">likely a prelude to selling on the open</text>
  <text start="226.05" dur="5.37">market because they you know they had it</text>
  <text start="228.96" dur="5.64">probably stored in cold storage and then</text>
  <text start="231.42" dur="6.21">they brought it out to the live internet</text>
  <text start="234.6" dur="4.8">sent it to him probably in exchange or</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="4.86">something and then they&amp;#39;ll send it and</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="5.25">sell it from there but the way Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="242.49" dur="3.81">works you can look up the number you can</text>
  <text start="244.65" dur="3.24">actually look at the link below and</text>
  <text start="246.3" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;ll see the wallet see how much they</text>
  <text start="247.89" dur="4.35">have in it and more importantly you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="4.65">be able to keep checking every so often</text>
  <text start="252.24" dur="4.95">and see when they sell if you notice</text>
  <text start="254.88" dur="4.229">that this guy sells a couple thousand</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="5.82">Bitcoin you&amp;#39;ll know the markets about to</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="8.87">go down so it&amp;#39;s really a valuable bit of</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="4.969">information and also worth mentioning</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="6.28">also worth mentioning the Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="274.02" dur="5.52">Bitcoin cash this guy is still sitting</text>
  <text start="276" dur="7.17">on is about valued around 1.5 billion</text>
  <text start="279.54" dur="5.37">dollars okay so and like I said that</text>
  <text start="283.17" dur="3.78">could go down to one or up to two in a</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="3.51">day who knows but in it when this</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="5.58">article was written that I&amp;#39;m going off</text>
  <text start="288.42" dur="6.03">of from bit talks calm I was about 1.5</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="5.9">billion okay and this is fairly recent</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="7.02">so if you&amp;#39;re holding a lot of Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="298.43" dur="5.08">and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="301.47" dur="3.42">figure out when it&amp;#39;s gonna go down and</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="2.88">maybe you want to sell off the top and</text>
  <text start="304.89" dur="3.21">buy back in at the bottom or whatever it</text>
  <text start="306.39" dur="3.27">is that you want to do or trade into</text>
  <text start="308.1" dur="5.04">some other currency or something like</text>
  <text start="309.66" dur="5.16">that I feel like it&amp;#39;s gonna it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="3.12">knock all of them down like last time</text>
  <text start="314.82" dur="4.02">though because when Bitcoin goes down</text>
  <text start="316.26" dur="5.04">everything else seems to go down but</text>
  <text start="318.84" dur="4.17">maybe you maybe you want to try to get</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.17">out at the top and buy back in at the</text>
  <text start="323.01" dur="4.41">bottom which completely makes sense I</text>
  <text start="325.47" dur="3.45">can&amp;#39;t think of an easier time to do</text>
  <text start="327.42" dur="4.11">something like that because it does seem</text>
  <text start="328.92" dur="4.89">somewhat predictable still it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="331.53" dur="5.28">risky world you know not financial</text>
  <text start="333.81" dur="5.64">advice but if you guys want to do that</text>
  <text start="336.81" dur="4.98">then go down to the blockchain info link</text>
  <text start="339.45" dur="6.09">in the description below and check it</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="5.13">out and let me know if if you notice in</text>
  <text start="345.54" dur="2.73">dumping thousands a Bitcoin I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="346.92" dur="3.12">definitely gonna be checking it out but</text>
