  <text start="0.949" dur="5.471">welcome back guys this is destiny most</text>
  <text start="3.419" dur="5.401">of destiny&amp;#39;s most calm this is gonna be</text>
  <text start="6.42" dur="4.28">a real quick cue video because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="8.82" dur="4.439">one post but before I get into the post</text>
  <text start="10.7" dur="4.87">it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning that there are two</text>
  <text start="13.259" dur="5.301">different narratives being played out on</text>
  <text start="15.57" dur="6.119">the one hand Rosenstein has apparently</text>
  <text start="18.56" dur="7">he&amp;#39;s resigned and he&amp;#39;s done so verbally</text>
  <text start="21.689" dur="5.641">to John Kelly and he&amp;#39;s doing it before</text>
  <text start="25.56" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s fired he expects to be fired on the</text>
  <text start="27.33" dur="4.56">other hand he has not resigned but he</text>
  <text start="29.31" dur="3.81">expects to be fired I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="31.89" dur="3">going on here why there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="33.12" dur="4.459">confusion why why they can&amp;#39;t pin this</text>
  <text start="34.89" dur="5.25">down but so far that I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="37.579" dur="4.151">Washington Post New York Times and Axios</text>
  <text start="40.14" dur="4.2">are saying he&amp;#39;s resigned before being</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="5.43">fired on the other hand Fox News</text>
  <text start="44.34" dur="5.67">Associated Press Reuters CNN NBC MSNBC</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="7.05">and ABC is reporting that he did not</text>
  <text start="50.01" dur="6.15">resign but expects to be fired now the</text>
  <text start="54.21" dur="4.739">best I can pull out here is that Sarah</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="6.449">Carter said he&amp;#39;s resigned verbally to</text>
  <text start="58.949" dur="5.371">chief of staff Kelly so I kind of trust</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="3.12">her as a source q seems to have implied</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="4.86">that we should listen to her and she</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="5.401">knows what&amp;#39;s going on so take it for</text>
  <text start="69.18" dur="3.75">what you want take it how you will there</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s just kind of where we&amp;#39;re at at</text>
  <text start="72.93" dur="5.85">the moment so let&amp;#39;s go through this one</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="5.7">Q post I don&amp;#39;t have my my other video is</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="4.32">encoding right now and I need to get</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="4.47">some sleep tonight so I don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="83.1" dur="6.21">ability to show screen right now but</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="7.05">it&amp;#39;s really quick it&amp;#39;s really fast he</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="5.61">says did the IG recommend Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="4.89">step down or be fired and he says speed</text>
  <text start="94.92" dur="4.53">remember that Trump requested this to be</text>
  <text start="96.93" dur="4.77">done with speed and Horowitz probably</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="3.809">would do so with speed because he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="4.5">one of the people trying to delay in</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="3.871">everything yeah q ass why was Rachel</text>

  <text start="125.82" dur="3.779">than the sky is falling the sky is</text>
  <text start="127.74" dur="3.39">falling at least if you&amp;#39;re on the left</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="5.171">and you&amp;#39;re a bad guy</text>
  <text start="131.13" dur="5.44">but you know specifically at the high</text>
  <text start="134.77" dur="3.81">levels of corruption not necessarily</text>
  <text start="136.57" dur="3.66">just an average person on the left just</text>
