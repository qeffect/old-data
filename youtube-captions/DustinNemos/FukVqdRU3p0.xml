  <text start="12.99" dur="5.61">voluntary basis in order to provide a</text>
  <text start="15.78" dur="3.57">very valuable utility for us a service</text>
  <text start="18.6" dur="2.07">for us</text>
  <text start="19.35" dur="2.939">who are following the queue stuff</text>
  <text start="20.67" dur="3.09">because I mean saves me thousands of</text>
  <text start="22.289" dur="3.211">hours not having to go back through the</text>
  <text start="23.76" dur="3.66">boards and like cite specific things</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="4.41">and/or create my own archive if you</text>
  <text start="27.42" dur="4.08">understand so this is exactly what Q is</text>
  <text start="29.91" dur="4.02">asked us to do they&amp;#39;re putting these</text>
  <text start="31.5" dur="5.489">websites up some of them are actually</text>

  <text start="43.68" dur="4.949">used as some sort of gotcha you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="45.149" dur="5.371">profiting off Q kind of thing we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="48.629" dur="3.691">pretty much back in the time when he was</text>
  <text start="50.52" dur="3.929">calling on Corsi and such we pretty much</text>
  <text start="52.32" dur="4.44">decisively figured out this situation q</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="5.16">doesn&amp;#39;t give a crap he was not actually</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="4.56">a socialist who doesn&amp;#39;t give a crap if</text>
  <text start="59.609" dur="3.09">people are making money by telling the</text>
  <text start="61.32" dur="4.14">world about it and it&amp;#39;s basically just</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="4.92">being a journalist or providing a</text>
  <text start="65.46" dur="3.99">valuable service okay q doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="67.619" dur="3.331">people to try to take over the movement</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="4.2">and insert their own disinfo the way</text>
  <text start="70.95" dur="6.27">course he basically admitted to doing ok</text>
  <text start="73.65" dur="7.55">so when Q called out horsey and seaman</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="6.75">and Jones and and all of those guys this</text>
  <text start="81.2" dur="5.68">this is part of the fallout there you</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="5.07">know I have to be very careful I mean no</text>
  <text start="86.88" dur="3.449">one&amp;#39;s gonna really assume unless the</text>
  <text start="89.04" dur="2.61">trolls are in there that no one&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="90.329" dur="3.841">going to assume that I&amp;#39;m like making a</text>
  <text start="91.65" dur="4.35">lot of profit off this movement but at</text>
  <text start="94.17" dur="4.53">the same point I have to be careful you</text>
  <text start="96" dur="5.03">know the way I do things as well so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="98.7" dur="4.83">not perceived to be some sort of like</text>
  <text start="101.03" dur="6.79">profit here of Q and on or something</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="6.54">like that at the end of the day we need</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="5.18">people out there spreading the Q word at</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="5.579">the end of the day those people probably</text>
  <text start="113" dur="5.079">I&amp;#39;m like least among them really guys I</text>
  <text start="115.649" dur="4.171">walk among Giants here okay I think that</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="4.621">a lot of those people are are like</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="5.579">heroes to society and those people</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="4.47">deserve to make a damn good living right</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="3.601">look at the money that the journalists</text>
  <text start="127.17" dur="4.23">for fake news make to set up their read</text>
  <text start="129" dur="4.47">a script they all read the same script</text>
  <text start="131.4" dur="2.46">you&amp;#39;ve seen the video or it&amp;#39;s like 30 40</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="2.28">50</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="3.6">100 of them saying the same words and he</text>
  <text start="135.75" dur="5.16">sings up and you can still hear it</text>
  <text start="137.46" dur="5.07">because it&amp;#39;s the same exact script ok</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="2.67">those people make like 200 thousand</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="2.49">dollars a year or something I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="4.74">know what it is is ridiculous something</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="4.62">I make less than minimum wage doing this</text>
  <text start="148.32" dur="2.91">in this way I&amp;#39;m not too worried about</text>
  <text start="149.64" dur="4.83">being accused of being a profiteer or</text>
  <text start="151.23" dur="5.4">anything the point is that people that</text>
  <text start="154.47" dur="3.57">you want to see more of you have to</text>
  <text start="156.63" dur="3.18">support that right you have to support</text>
  <text start="158.04" dur="3.12">that in the free market by purchasing</text>
  <text start="159.81" dur="3.36">their products or you have to support</text>
  <text start="161.16" dur="4.11">that just by supporting them with</text>
  <text start="163.17" dur="4.32">donations or whatever and you guys do</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="4.26">that for me and for the alt media and</text>
  <text start="167.49" dur="3.99">you guys understand that necessity I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="4.29">not really having to tell you that</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re using that as sort of an attack</text>
  <text start="173.82" dur="5.31">and some sort of we got you I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="5.25">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of that going around</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="5.85">lately there&amp;#39;s obviously my opinion here</text>
  <text start="182.34" dur="5.34">but there&amp;#39;s obviously a push and</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="6.72">organised propaganda kind of push not</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="5.79">just trolls but you know dozens of</text>
  <text start="191.7" dur="4.02">trolls that lift the same message and</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="3.93">use the same argument the next you know</text>
  <text start="195.72" dur="3.48">each day you know they&amp;#39;ll switch</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="3.54">together and things like that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.2" dur="3.66">hard to describe but you see it kind of</text>
  <text start="200.94" dur="5.579">when you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re reading through</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="5.52">these things every day all day but I</text>

  <text start="1460.899" dur="4.551">had time to gather a lot of evidence</text>
  <text start="1462.96" dur="5.52">stuff as well even the open-source</text>
  <text start="1465.45" dur="5.13">investigations are proven it defense</text>
  <text start="1468.48" dur="3.78">distributed okay I talked about these</text>
  <text start="1470.58" dur="3.569">guys recently they are again in the</text>

  <text start="1482.309" dur="3.631">huge deal if you think about what that</text>
  <text start="1483.72" dur="5.25">means basically you can start track your</text>

  <text start="1505.529" dur="5.791">but for personal use I think this is</text>
  <text start="1508.5" dur="4.71">actually great and in fact I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="1511.32" dur="3.06">about buying one of those machines when</text>
  <text start="1513.21" dur="2.939">they become available they&amp;#39;re gun</text>

  <text start="1520.95" dur="4.53">make their own weapons and they just pay</text>
  <text start="1522.99" dur="3.72">me a fee or something that would be it</text>
  <text start="1525.48" dur="2.28">would pay for itself in like three days</text>
  <text start="1526.71" dur="2.579">I think so</text>
  <text start="1527.76" dur="3.529">you guys might want to copy and just do</text>
  <text start="1529.289" dur="4.231">this like in your local settings because</text>
  <text start="1531.289" dur="6.961">they&amp;#39;re printing their own gun that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1533.52" dur="8.6">completely legal as I understand it and</text>
  <text start="1538.25" dur="6.789">let&amp;#39;s see where were we</text>
  <text start="1542.12" dur="4.39">my point in bringing them back up I got</text>
  <text start="1545.039" dur="3.901">kind of excited about talking about the</text>
  <text start="1546.51" dur="4.32">the concept because what it really means</text>
  <text start="1548.94" dur="4.89">is the end of gun control everywhere</text>
  <text start="1550.83" dur="6.36">everywhere there&amp;#39;s internet in power and</text>
  <text start="1553.83" dur="5.819">any sort of free market at all but</text>
  <text start="1557.19" dur="3.719">apparently and and that also means for</text>
  <text start="1559.649" dur="2.461">gangs by that way gangs are gonna learn</text>
  <text start="1560.909" dur="3.211">about these things too by the way and</text>
  <text start="1562.11" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re gonna use these as well okay you</text>
  <text start="1564.12" dur="4.58">have to keep you know the weapons race</text>
  <text start="1566.58" dur="5.729">somewhat even to create that peace</text>
  <text start="1568.7" dur="5.829">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s peace is the symptom of</text>
  <text start="1572.309" dur="4.411">two sides that hate each other</text>
  <text start="1574.529" dur="4.321">but are both armed okay that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1646.92" dur="6.03">just basically ready to invade almost at</text>

  <text start="3079.569" dur="3.871">idea of getting these out there as far</text>
  <text start="3080.98" dur="4.349">as like the big Trump speaking events</text>
  <text start="3083.44" dur="4.409">cuz you could tell there was a sea of</text>

  <text start="3100.39" dur="2.82">basically point the crowd and say look</text>
  <text start="3101.98" dur="2.69">how many people are seeing you know</text>
  <text start="3103.21" dur="5.129">he&amp;#39;ll do the same thing he did before</text>
  <text start="3104.67" dur="7.27">now with that said briefly I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="3108.339" dur="5.76">before about creating a lightweight suit</text>
  <text start="3111.94" dur="4.47">of space-age armor basically and this</text>
  <text start="3114.099" dur="4.801">sounds goofy I&amp;#39;m completely serious</text>
  <text start="3116.41" dur="5.13">about it for home protection would be</text>
  <text start="3118.9" dur="4.8">cool but basically this was to protect</text>
  <text start="3121.54" dur="6.809">people from from some of these explosive</text>
  <text start="3123.7" dur="6.69">devices knife attacks ice picks possibly</text>
  <text start="3128.349" dur="3.601">guns these this would probably stop most</text>
  <text start="3130.39" dur="2.76">small caliber bullets you can see some</text>
  <text start="3131.95" dur="2.849">of the YouTube tests on there I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="3133.15" dur="3.78">making any claims but I look up</text>
  <text start="3134.799" dur="5.371">polycarbonate strength tests and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3136.93" dur="5.639">see what I&amp;#39;m talking about it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="3140.17" dur="4.26">very it&amp;#39;s not a very heavy kind of</text>
  <text start="3142.569" dur="4.53">material it can be cold bent or heat</text>
  <text start="3144.43" dur="6.24">bent but I have no experience making</text>
  <text start="3147.099" dur="6.421">armor and if I could get help to design</text>
  <text start="3150.67" dur="4.8">the pieces then cut them out or any tips</text>
  <text start="3153.52" dur="3.72">for how to bend this stuff in a</text>
  <text start="3155.47" dur="4.649">good-looking way to make it more</text>
  <text start="3157.24" dur="3.809">functional but also less bulky I would</text>
  <text start="3160.119" dur="2.371">like some help to do that</text>
  <text start="3161.049" dur="4.201">the goal is to create like a workable</text>
  <text start="3162.49" dur="4.29">prototype show it off on a youtube video</text>
  <text start="3165.25" dur="3.42">get beat up by a baseball bat or</text>
  <text start="3166.78" dur="5.069">something stupid you know kind of fun</text>
  <text start="3168.67" dur="6">with it and then use this as a template</text>
  <text start="3171.849" dur="4.621">for people to purchase or preferably to</text>
  <text start="3174.67" dur="3.929">just DIY at home if they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3176.47" dur="3.81">these these events not I mean you can</text>
  <text start="3178.599" dur="3.631">use this for self-defense and basically</text>
  <text start="3180.28" dur="2.82">take a SWAT team on and winds if you do</text>
  <text start="3182.23" dur="3.15">it right</text>
  <text start="3183.1" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s not the goal the goal is for</text>
  <text start="3185.38" dur="3.36">people who are getting into these crowds</text>
  <text start="3187.09" dur="3">at these peaceful Trump supporting</text>
