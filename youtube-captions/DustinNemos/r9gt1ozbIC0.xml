  <text start="6.629" dur="4.911">mention something so it turns out</text>
  <text start="8.73" dur="5.909">instead of addressing you know my my</text>
  <text start="11.54" dur="5.2">criticism which by the way started out</text>
  <text start="14.639" dur="4.321">to be very polite and have only had to</text>
  <text start="16.74" dur="3.9">ramp up after he&amp;#39;s basically just</text>
  <text start="18.96" dur="4.229">continues to lie and doesn&amp;#39;t address</text>
  <text start="20.64" dur="5.91">anything so at this you know at this</text>
  <text start="23.189" dur="6.51">point it&amp;#39;s like hey he actually made a</text>
  <text start="26.55" dur="5.7">comment acting like um like he&amp;#39;s super</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="10.981">Christian you know basically let me see</text>
  <text start="32.25" dur="9.84">if I can find it he says I really have</text>
  <text start="40.68" dur="2.91">no time for Christians of different</text>
  <text start="42.09" dur="3.57">denominations who spend all their time</text>
  <text start="43.59" dur="4.59">attacking other Christians for having</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="3.87">different prayers or traditions we are</text>
  <text start="48.18" dur="3.69">in a war against Satan and his demons</text>
  <text start="49.53" dur="4.169">not each other what would Christ want I</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="6.36">said he&amp;#39;d want you to quit long to your</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="7.5">audience Jack so he actually then chose</text>
  <text start="58.23" dur="5.009">to rather than address you know my</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="3.271">criticism and asked me what am i lying</text>
  <text start="63.239" dur="2.971">about and then we could get into a</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="3.36">debate about it like I&amp;#39;ve said he I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="66.21" dur="5.82">offered to debate him numerous times</text>
  <text start="67.83" dur="5.609">instead he docs is mean so you know if</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="3.839">for those who&amp;#39;ve been paying attention I</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="5.161">have a criminal record either you</text>
  <text start="75.869" dur="5.011">believe in the justice system being you</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="4.589">know perfect and infallible and you know</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="3.989">carrying out justice or you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="83.189" dur="3.421">paying attention and your eyes are open</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="4.32">in the last couple of years and you know</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="6.509">Trump is a perfect example that did the</text>
  <text start="89.189" dur="6.781">justice system is not just the important</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="5.79">thing is that my past has no shame or</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="4.56">dishonor in it and I&amp;#39;ve addressed these</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="4.471">criticisms in the past the average</text>
  <text start="100.53" dur="5.19">person actually commits three felonies a</text>
  <text start="103.38" dur="4.23">day and if you&amp;#39;re watching this you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="4.71">probably above average because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="4.77">probably against the system and</text>
  <text start="110.43" dur="3.509">therefore you know I&amp;#39;m sure that they</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="5.279">would find more on you if they chose to</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="7.081">do so so yes I have a criminal history</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="5.1">but I don&amp;#39;t have a dishonest or shameful</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="4.919">history and that&amp;#39;s really kind of a</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="5.761">thing that they try to go around now in</text>
  <text start="125.939" dur="4.801">comparison because you know he just</text>
  <text start="128.52" dur="6.51">doxxed me and put my name out there for</text>
  <text start="130.74" dur="7.71">his fairly large audience of almost</text>
  <text start="135.03" dur="4.83">400,000 followers so which is perfect by</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="2.76">the way I really don&amp;#39;t mind at all and</text>
  <text start="139.86" dur="5.07">actually was super glad he did this</text>
  <text start="141.21" dur="5.19">because he just doxxed me and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="144.93" dur="4.8">just gonna blow up in his face</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="6.93">so you know he he says how was your stay</text>
  <text start="149.73" dur="5.7">in Randolph County Jail Krieger well for</text>
  <text start="153.33" dur="3.84">one I chose to use the name nemos</text>
  <text start="155.43" dur="5.31">because I really wanted to spare my wife</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="5.51">and child what&amp;#39;s going through for Mike</text>
  <text start="160.74" dur="5.28">Srinivas right now I mean he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="4.66">getting harassed and DOX my wife is not</text>
  <text start="166.02" dur="3.33">really into this stuff I mean she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="4.2">supportive but you know she doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="169.35" dur="4.98">to deal with all the drama and she&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="5.37">a combative person she&amp;#39;s just a simple</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="4.08">good-hearted woman and I didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="176.91" dur="3.72">want to bring you know my family or</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="4.77">anything into this so I used the name</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="6.09">Nemo&amp;#39;s which is Latin for no one or</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="6.84">nobody if you ever read Odysseus then</text>
  <text start="186.72" dur="6.87">you would know okay use this the name</text>
  <text start="190.02" dur="5.73">Nemo and the Cyclops had him and he was</text>
  <text start="193.59" dur="7.38">trying to escape and he poked out that</text>
  <text start="195.75" dur="8.01">Cyclops his eye and he told him before</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="4.32">that that his name was Nemo or no one so</text>
  <text start="203.76" dur="4.29">when the Cyclops his brothers came to</text>
  <text start="205.29" dur="3.57">help and they asked him who did this who</text>
  <text start="208.05" dur="3.18">stabbed out your eye</text>
  <text start="208.86" dur="4.35">he said no one stabbed out my eye and</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="4.88">therefore they were able to escape under</text>
  <text start="213.21" dur="6.57">the giant sheep interesting story</text>
  <text start="216.11" dur="6.31">however let&amp;#39;s address this a little bit</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="6.51">in terms of morality in terms of</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="5.42">integrity now I&amp;#39;m not one for hit pieces</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="4.17">or fake news or anything like that</text>
  <text start="227.84" dur="6.51">however we have to address the arguments</text>
  <text start="230.46" dur="7.94">now if we&amp;#39;re do if we&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>

  <text start="253.38" dur="6.72">doubt it and I just wanted to put it out</text>
  <text start="256.89" dur="7.499">there so this is the kind of thing where</text>
  <text start="260.1" dur="7.17">you know if you&amp;#39;re comparing</text>
