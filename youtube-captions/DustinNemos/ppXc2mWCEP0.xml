  <text start="30.75" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="36.98" dur="4.75">welcome about my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="39.6" dur="4.11">Nemo&amp;#39;s of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="4.649">there are some pretty serious queue</text>
  <text start="43.71" dur="5.58">drops and a lot more after the post that</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="4.86">I covered laughs once again as usual I</text>
  <text start="49.29" dur="4.65">was there a little bit early and I got</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="4.651">the initial queue stuff and then there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="53.94" dur="3.75">more afterwards so I really should just</text>
  <text start="55.89" dur="3.78">wait until the evening is done until</text>
  <text start="57.69" dur="3.75">like midnight or something where all of</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="3.09">the posts are out and and queue is</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="2.969">posted after midnight I think in the</text>
  <text start="62.76" dur="3.96">past but for the most part usually</text>
  <text start="64.409" dur="4.71">things are done by then and then make a</text>
  <text start="66.72" dur="4.44">full assessment but we&amp;#39;re gonna dive in</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="5.941">there&amp;#39;s some queue so let&amp;#39;s jump right</text>
  <text start="71.16" dur="5.43">into it now we left off at 36:12 and it</text>
  <text start="75.06" dur="3.93">was a big one it was chairman Graham</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s time Sinnott was the target now we</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="3.93">already know for those who are new to</text>
  <text start="80.31" dur="4.559">the queue movement it seems to the best</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="3.93">of our knowledge that losing the house</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="4.321">in the midterms was actually a strategic</text>
  <text start="86.85" dur="4.32">victory for us it allowed the Democrats</text>
  <text start="89.19" dur="4.08">just enough power to fill in Bolton to</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="4.229">go do crazy things like impeachment and</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="3.75">it allowed the the Senate to have the</text>
  <text start="95.399" dur="3.241">real power which is exactly where</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="3.54">chairman Graham is and we&amp;#39;ve seen him</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="3.57">posting about corn and things of that</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="3.33">nature as well right so again that goes</text>
  <text start="102.21" dur="3.06">back to Comey and the harvest and the</text>
  <text start="103.89" dur="3.479">whole corn metaphor that we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="3.419">dealing with lately which by the way if</text>
  <text start="107.369" dur="3.721">you look up the amount of time it takes</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="3.781">apparently - I guess harvest the corn I</text>
  <text start="111.09" dur="4.2">think I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact one I</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="4.32">heard it also turned into like a 17 I</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="2.82">don&amp;#39;t remember that one let me know in</text>
  <text start="116.79" dur="2.25">the comments if you&amp;#39;ve heard that one</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="2.759">too</text>
  <text start="119.04" dur="5.969">but there&amp;#39;s a bunch of this new queue</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="7.5">and this one is really long so 36 13 now</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="5.911">queue says what happens when 90% of the</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="4.921">media is controlled / owned by six</text>
  <text start="130.92" dur="3.87">corporations Wow</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="3.81">I heard somewhere it might be down to</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="3.96">five now what happens when those same</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="5.34">corporations are operated and controlled</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="5.94">by a political ideology see that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="4.109">getting into a very scary Orwellian kind</text>
  <text start="144.69" dur="3.84">of future right because they control</text>
  <text start="146.549" dur="3.901">information they control the stories</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="4.23">that people hear they control the the</text>
  <text start="150.45" dur="5.43">narrative that shapes the world I mean</text>
  <text start="152.76" dur="6.81">that is powerful right according to some</text>
  <text start="155.88" dur="6.12">narratives we are floating on a ball in</text>
  <text start="159.57" dur="5.76">space at like a billion miles an hour&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162" dur="6.9">like flying around the Sun and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="165.33" dur="4.739">just scattered rocks everywhere just we</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="2.759">could smash into the Mideast</text>
  <text start="170.069" dur="3.181">right and then according to another</text>
  <text start="171.659" dur="3.211">narrative we&amp;#39;re the center of the</text>
  <text start="173.25" dur="5.79">universe and the Sun revolves around us</text>
  <text start="174.87" dur="6.179">and that&amp;#39;s it so those are two very very</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="3.569">powerful narratives and I use that as an</text>
  <text start="181.049" dur="3.72">example because at one point people</text>
  <text start="182.609" dur="3.481">believed the world was flat and that we</text>
  <text start="184.769" dur="3.481">were the center of the universe until</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="3.78">Galileo proved them wrong and of course</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="3.359">he was persecuted by the church for it</text>
  <text start="189.87" dur="4.02">and possibly started the whole</text>
  <text start="191.609" dur="4.621">Illuminati nonsense right there so</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s the power of the narrative if</text>
  <text start="196.23" dur="3.239">they can control the stories that you</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="3.989">hear whether or not you trust them and</text>
  <text start="199.469" dur="5.251">believe them they can shape your very</text>
  <text start="201.659" dur="4.651">belief system you&amp;#39;re very destiny now</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="3.87">that is the power that he was talking</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="4.59">about here what happens and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="208.59" dur="4.349">the alternative media is so important it</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="3.36">creates that that cognitive dissonance</text>
  <text start="212.939" dur="3.121">and the minds of the people that are</text>
  <text start="214.26" dur="3.24">that are buying into that be us and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="3.78">like well maybe some of them will wake</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="4.349">up and some of them will question now</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="5.31">what happens when the news is no longer</text>
  <text start="221.849" dur="5.25">free from bias same thing what happens</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="5.25">when the news is no longer reliable and</text>
  <text start="227.099" dur="7.771">independent same thing what happens when</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="6.119">the news is no longer trustworthy what</text>
  <text start="234.87" dur="5.6">happens when the news simply becomes an</text>
  <text start="236.519" dur="7.5">extension or arm of a political party</text>
  <text start="240.47" dur="7.09">fact becomes fiction fiction becomes</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="7.201">fact when does the news propagate news</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="5.759">become propaganda so you guys have seen</text>
  <text start="251.22" dur="3.689">a lot of this lately impeachments a good</text>
  <text start="253.319" dur="3.871">example Russian collusions a good</text>
  <text start="254.909" dur="3.69">example they&amp;#39;re determined to tell</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="3.599">everyone that they have all the facts in</text>
  <text start="258.599" dur="4.591">hand and it&amp;#39;s a closed case they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="260.789" dur="5.1">even provided a single fact yet it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="4.199">very interesting dilemma but fact it</text>
  <text start="265.889" dur="3.27">becomes fiction fiction becomes fact</text>
  <text start="267.389" dur="4.351">reality is blurred and everyone&amp;#39;s stupid</text>
  <text start="269.159" dur="5.341">for it except those of course paying</text>
  <text start="271.74" dur="6.149">attention to alternative media now</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="5.34">identity creation how does the average</text>
  <text start="277.889" dur="5.191">person who is under constant financial</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="7.62">stress by design find time to research</text>
  <text start="283.08" dur="6.78">and discern fact versus fiction majority</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="5.31">of people you know what I want to say</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="6.119">something to this because I had a I had</text>
  <text start="292.77" dur="5.73">a troubled childhood I had a mother who</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="4.321">was a drug addict brother and sister</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="3.15">that I was trying to save I was sort of</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="2.31">the dad figure for a while and was a</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="1.84">little boy I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="3.64">doing and then</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="6.54">I left that to go live with my dad and</text>
  <text start="306.25" dur="5.34">eventually my grandparents and you know</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="5.16">my little brother and sister followed in</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="5.759">my mom&amp;#39;s footsteps but by moving to my</text>
  <text start="315.19" dur="2.759">it all it all worked out for the best</text>
  <text start="317.349" dur="1.981">for me</text>
  <text start="317.949" dur="3.891">I really regret what happened to my</text>
  <text start="319.33" dur="4.98">family and I wish I could save them but</text>
  <text start="321.84" dur="4.21">for me I ended up with my grandparents</text>
  <text start="324.31" dur="4.199">who kind of spoiled me just a little bit</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="4.709">right I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m this street urchin almost</text>
  <text start="328.509" dur="4.951">right I&amp;#39;ve practically homeless living</text>
  <text start="330.759" dur="6.121">with my mom and this like crappy trailer</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="5.34">in the middle of of nowhere and and and</text>
  <text start="336.88" dur="3.659">all of her abusive boyfriends that</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="5.16">basically like to beat on kids if they</text>
  <text start="340.539" dur="5.521">don&amp;#39;t listen so escaping that going to</text>
  <text start="343.96" dur="3.78">my grandparents I was able to be just a</text>
  <text start="346.06" dur="3.81">little bit spoiled like they were not</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="5.16">wealthy they were middle-class</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="4.62">blue-collar furniture people like the</text>
  <text start="352.9" dur="3.63">furniture capital of the world is where</text>
  <text start="354.49" dur="4.169">I grew up most of my family were in</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="3.84">furniture and actually my dad he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.659" dur="3.181">upper-level in furniture you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="360.37" dur="4.049">the he&amp;#39;s the most successful of us all</text>
  <text start="361.84" dur="4.38">right he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s I think just over a six</text>
  <text start="364.419" dur="3.601">figure in common furniture rights he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.22" dur="5.52">he&amp;#39;s like a manager or something in a</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="6.179">furniture designer he&amp;#39;s cool guy but my</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="4.08">grandparents were just career furniture</text>
  <text start="374.199" dur="3.75">people you know I think they made like</text>
  <text start="375.82" dur="3.649">20 bucks an hour or something and they</text>
  <text start="377.949" dur="3.931">didn&amp;#39;t spend a lot they were</text>
  <text start="379.469" dur="5.021">conservatives they saved and they had a</text>
  <text start="381.88" dur="4.529">good life and they had you know a pool</text>
  <text start="384.49" dur="3.72">and and you know a little bit of money</text>
  <text start="386.409" dur="5.401">extra to spoil me with things like</text>
  <text start="388.21" dur="5.19">computers or video games when I got that</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="3.479">computer guys and I had a little bit of</text>
  <text start="393.4" dur="4.56">spare time thanks to my grandparents I</text>
  <text start="395.289" dur="6.56">started to dig into everything and then</text>
  <text start="397.96" dur="6.69">I ended up here yeah 16 17 years later</text>
  <text start="401.849" dur="4.451">that is the power of getting out of</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="5.34">their little system their financial</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="6.6">stress system for just a minute that is</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="5.13">the power and that is why they have to</text>
  <text start="412.9" dur="4.139">have us constantly looking down at our</text>
  <text start="415.12" dur="4.289">feet slaving away rather than looking at</text>
  <text start="417.039" dur="5.821">the stars for the truth just a metaphor</text>
  <text start="419.409" dur="5.431">it&amp;#39;s not the Stars just an example how</text>
  <text start="422.86" dur="3.39">does the average person own that that</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="3.69">reminds me of a good quote before I</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="4.199">continue are we human because we gaze at</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="5.1">the Stars or do we gaze at the Stars</text>
  <text start="430.449" dur="4.44">because we are human that&amp;#39;ll blow your</text>
  <text start="433.63" dur="3.36">mind if you think about it for a while</text>
  <text start="434.889" dur="4.881">now how does the average person who is</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="6.12">constant financial stress by design a</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="6.19">theme I see you find time to research</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="5">and discern fact versus fiction my</text>
  <text start="445.96" dur="4.83">daughter tried to come in the door here</text>
  <text start="448.11" dur="4.84">majority of people more prone to believe</text>
  <text start="450.79" dur="7.32">someone in power sitting behind a big</text>
  <text start="452.95" dur="7.08">brand news name of course now this</text>
  <text start="458.11" dur="2.97">before we continue I want to I want to</text>
  <text start="460.03" dur="2.79">make sure that people understand like</text>
  <text start="461.08" dur="4.47">follow the leader mentality we are a</text>
  <text start="462.82" dur="5.1">herd species alright we are a herd</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="3.93">species we follow the leader now some</text>
  <text start="467.92" dur="3.12">people want to be the leader and then</text>
  <text start="469.48" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s that whole like hierarchy of</text>
  <text start="471.04" dur="6.69">power thing an authority but we are for</text>
  <text start="476.38" dur="4.32">the most part follow the leader people</text>
  <text start="477.73" dur="4.74">and we tend to expect that our leaders</text>
  <text start="480.7" dur="4.26">are going to do the best for us right</text>
  <text start="482.47" dur="3.96">that and and people can&amp;#39;t be an expert</text>
  <text start="484.96" dur="2.82">in everything and this actually makes a</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="2.7">lot of sense to want to like follow</text>
  <text start="487.78" dur="2.94">someone who&amp;#39;s done the research on a</text>
  <text start="489.13" dur="4.14">particular topic and everything else and</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="4.05">that in a good world can work really</text>
  <text start="493.27" dur="3.9">well for us I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not faulting</text>
  <text start="494.77" dur="6.42">that we&amp;#39;re a herd species we&amp;#39;re social</text>
  <text start="497.17" dur="6.18">right no man is an island but people do</text>
  <text start="501.19" dur="4.61">tend to follow and believe in positions</text>
  <text start="503.35" dur="5.4">of authority there&amp;#39;s a really good study</text>
  <text start="505.8" dur="4.87">for example where they they ask him for</text>
  <text start="508.75" dur="4.59">the name of the study but they had a man</text>
  <text start="510.67" dur="4.02">in the room pretend like in a shocked</text>
  <text start="513.34" dur="3.57">chair locked in a shocked chair just</text>
  <text start="514.69" dur="4.58">strapped down and he was an actor it was</text>
  <text start="516.91" dur="5.34">all fake but it was an electric chair</text>
  <text start="519.27" dur="4.99">scenario and then on the other side of a</text>
  <text start="522.25" dur="3.63">one-way mirror they had a control room</text>
  <text start="524.26" dur="3.51">with buttons and knobs and people and</text>
  <text start="525.88" dur="3.57">white well AB coats and scientists</text>
  <text start="527.77" dur="3.21">looking people and they would test</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="4.14">people by bringing them in from the</text>
  <text start="530.98" dur="4.17">street and they would have them under</text>
  <text start="533.59" dur="3.39">the orders of someone in a position of</text>
  <text start="535.15" dur="3.06">authority a lab figure in this case I</text>
  <text start="536.98" dur="2.94">guess I&amp;#39;m one in a lab coat</text>
  <text start="538.21" dur="3.96">tell them to continue to turn up the</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="4.77">knob shocked and more giving more power</text>
  <text start="542.17" dur="5.52">give it more juice now two-thirds of</text>
  <text start="544.69" dur="4.26">those people roughly would do so all the</text>
  <text start="547.69" dur="3.66">way up to the point where that person</text>
  <text start="548.95" dur="5.84">died or faked death you know he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="551.35" dur="6.81">there literally you know faking it right</text>
  <text start="554.79" dur="5.2">one third of them refused to do so</text>
  <text start="558.16" dur="4.05">because they were free willed and</text>
  <text start="559.99" dur="5.58">independent and it&amp;#39;s a very telling</text>
  <text start="562.21" dur="4.74">study because it&amp;#39;s pretty much what</text>
  <text start="565.57" dur="3.09">generally happens in real life and the</text>
  <text start="566.95" dur="3.51">interesting thing is that the one that</text>
  <text start="568.66" dur="2.04">refused the strong-minded person could</text>
  <text start="570.46" dur="2.16">be a</text>
  <text start="570.7" dur="4.56">little old lady and the one that obeyed</text>
  <text start="572.62" dur="4.62">could be a big strong man didn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="575.26" dur="5.55">it was about the spirit though the mind</text>

  <text start="916.53" dur="3.48">best marketer I&amp;#39;m really not but I</text>
  <text start="918.3" dur="4.14">understand that marketing is the science</text>

  <text start="940.41" dur="5.31">people it can be used to propagandize</text>

  <text start="949.74" dur="5.88">among all of the different media figures</text>
  <text start="952.07" dur="5.53">right so that&amp;#39;s important to understand</text>
  <text start="955.62" dur="3.42">when you see these kind of things when</text>
  <text start="957.6" dur="3.15">you see a hundred different news</text>

  <text start="960.75" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;ve seen videos like that from the</text>
  <text start="962.4" dur="3.09">news channels right they use the exact</text>
  <text start="963.87" dur="3.75">same talking points so we&amp;#39;ve seen it all</text>
  <text start="965.49" dur="3.78">and then you can even transpose 100 of</text>

  <text start="969.27" dur="1.52">still hear what&amp;#39;s being said because</text>

  <text start="973.16" dur="6.78">being different rarely they get their 3</text>

  <text start="979.94" dur="5.55">mainstream media hides the Lala so</text>
  <text start="982.07" dur="4.59">continuing on and of course the the</text>
  <text start="985.49" dur="5.31">marketing side of that before I continue</text>
  <text start="986.66" dur="5.46">is that repetition eventually gets into</text>
