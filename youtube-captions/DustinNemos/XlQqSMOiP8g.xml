  <text start="6.319" dur="23.641">believes in freedom to Liberty are being</text>
  <text start="8.87" dur="23.249">held back by the most powerful welcome</text>

  <text start="37.85" dur="2.88">screen view and I&amp;#39;m gonna fly through as</text>
  <text start="40.01" dur="3.03">fast as I can</text>
  <text start="40.73" dur="4.5">for brevity&amp;#39;s sake I&amp;#39;m waiting on a</text>
  <text start="43.04" dur="3.63">flight so I&amp;#39;ve got about 30 minutes I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="45.23" dur="2.94">gonna try to get through some of the</text>
  <text start="46.67" dur="2.88">points that have been building up when I</text>
  <text start="48.17" dur="2.79">haven&amp;#39;t a chance to get the news out on</text>
  <text start="49.55" dur="3.72">these yes there&amp;#39;s a few things I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="50.96" dur="8.46">roll through really quick so here we go</text>
  <text start="53.27" dur="8.49">let&amp;#39;s dive in alright so this one I hid</text>
  <text start="59.42" dur="3.54">me in a personal way because this is</text>
  <text start="61.76" dur="3.209">something that you&amp;#39;re always worried</text>
  <text start="62.96" dur="5.609">about if you&amp;#39;re in the truth media so</text>
  <text start="64.969" dur="6.33">Hannity even tells the Lindsey Graham it</text>
  <text start="68.569" dur="4.59">was that he is afraid it&amp;#39;s not even a</text>
  <text start="71.299" dur="3.691">joke even clarifies this is not a joke</text>
  <text start="73.159" dur="4.14">he fears that he will be rated or ond</text>
  <text start="74.99" dur="4.71">just for covering the truth in the news</text>
  <text start="77.299" dur="4.05">about Russia game I mean we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="79.7" dur="2.939">again and again they will weaponize</text>
  <text start="81.349" dur="3.27">these through layer agencies like the</text>
  <text start="82.639" dur="3.72">FBI to go after people with no evidence</text>
  <text start="84.619" dur="4.74">just so they can try to destroy our</text>
  <text start="86.359" dur="4.83">president now we also have the Trump</text>
  <text start="89.359" dur="3.231">administration on considering allowing</text>
  <text start="91.189" dur="3.24">cities and states to determine</text>
  <text start="92.59" dur="4.72">themselves if they want to accept</text>
  <text start="94.429" dur="5.07">refugees that&amp;#39;s pretty powerful I mean</text>
  <text start="97.31" dur="4.519">that would basically force all of the</text>
  <text start="99.499" dur="4.5">illegal migration to a few</text>
  <text start="101.829" dur="5.74">democrat-controlled states and cities</text>
  <text start="103.999" dur="5.311">and of course topple them economically</text>
  <text start="107.569" dur="6.9">speaking pista you just cannot handle</text>
  <text start="109.31" dur="7.289">that much that many moochers that will</text>
  <text start="114.469" dur="5.04">take more than the system because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.599" dur="5.07">basically what socialism is and largely</text>
  <text start="119.509" dur="5.34">a socialist nation already believe it or</text>
  <text start="121.669" dur="4.98">not so that&amp;#39;s very powerful and if that</text>
  <text start="124.849" dur="5.311">actually goes through I expect about</text>
  <text start="126.649" dur="5.881">40-plus states are gonna reject so that</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="3.93">will be very interesting to see now you</text>
  <text start="132.53" dur="2.56">know some cities may try to still be</text>
  <text start="134.09" dur="4.06">sanctuary whatever</text>
  <text start="135.09" dur="4.38">we also have and I don&amp;#39;t really you know</text>
  <text start="138.15" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;ve seen this gone before I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="139.47" dur="4.8">really particularly care for not much</text>
  <text start="141.27" dur="5.46">these think he&amp;#39;s cheek you girly nephew</text>
  <text start="144.27" dur="4.71">or something but his name is Hasan piker</text>
  <text start="146.73" dur="5.58">and he&amp;#39;s at the Young Turks Network and</text>
  <text start="148.98" dur="5.52">he says America deserved 9/11 and he</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="4.74">even praises the brave soldier that took</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="3.93">representative Crenshaw&amp;#39;s I so that</text>
  <text start="157.05" dur="3.78">tells you something right there about</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="4.05">the kind of mentality that we&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="160.83" dur="2.939">with they really don&amp;#39;t care that in fact</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;re celebrating a Koch brothers</text>
  <text start="163.769" dur="4.231">death not that I&amp;#39;m a fan of the Koch</text>
  <text start="165.36" dur="6.09">brother but they&amp;#39;re actually celebrating</text>
  <text start="168" dur="5.79">her wasn&amp;#39;t that strange actually</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re actually celebrating the death</text>
  <text start="173.79" dur="4.229">of an egg and hopefully Bill Maher</text>
  <text start="176.19" dur="3.57">himself was hoping that it was painful</text>
  <text start="178.019" dur="4.08">said he had more I think he had more</text>
  <text start="179.76" dur="4.5">respect for the cancer that took him out</text>
  <text start="182.099" dur="3.331">now right so that&amp;#39;s kind of thing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="2.61">dealing with there&amp;#39;s no ethics there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="3">no morals there&amp;#39;s just this sort of</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="3">illusion and projection of ethics and</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="3.48">what they can use that as a weapon to</text>
  <text start="189.87" dur="4.32">hurt people but as soon as you challenge</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="2.939">it hate comes out and you start to see</text>
  <text start="194.19" dur="3.69">the truth</text>
  <text start="194.849" dur="4.86">now we also have the federal court</text>
  <text start="197.88" dur="5.729">ruling that Electoral College members</text>
  <text start="199.709" dur="5.31">are not bound by popular vote so this</text>
  <text start="203.609" dur="3.361">kind of blew up on their face a little</text>
  <text start="205.019" dur="4.111">bit but basically the idea was that they</text>
  <text start="206.97" dur="4.349">had to vote for you know the majority of</text>
  <text start="209.13" dur="3.66">the states choice or whatever and of</text>
  <text start="211.319" dur="2.881">course the left has been trying in fact</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="2.97">they have many states already trying to</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="3.84">agree to this they can actually pull it</text>
  <text start="215.76" dur="4.14">off to get rid of the electoral college</text>
  <text start="218.04" dur="5.91">so that New York and California can tell</text>
  <text start="219.9" dur="6.209">everybody else what to do and cheat we</text>
  <text start="223.95" dur="4.53">also have President Trump saying he is</text>
  <text start="226.109" dur="4.201">still looking seriously that&amp;#39;s a quote</text>
  <text start="228.48" dur="5.31">looking seriously at ending birthright</text>
  <text start="230.31" dur="4.5">citizenship so in certain you know years</text>
  <text start="233.79" dur="3.66">we&amp;#39;ve had like eight nine percent</text>
  <text start="234.81" dur="4.47">sometimes all births in the u.s. come</text>
  <text start="237.45" dur="4.11">from people that are citizens of foreign</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="5.64">nations that do not have their loyalty</text>
  <text start="241.56" dur="5.37">or America&amp;#39;s best interest apart and it</text>
  <text start="244.92" dur="3.87">is not a good sign it is a culture</text>
  <text start="246.93" dur="4.529">change if it&amp;#39;s a destruction of American</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="3.87">values and economy so you know obviously</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="2.581">there&amp;#39;s a lot of problems we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="252.66" dur="2.82">hashed that out in the air in the</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="2.91">narrative that&amp;#39;s why all they really do</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="3.45">anymore is called Trump races because</text>
  <text start="256.95" dur="4.77">they have an argument but this would be</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="5.04">a very good thing for America now</text>
  <text start="261.72" dur="4.11">President Trump is also signing in order</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="3.78">to or signed in order to forgive student</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="2.49">loan debt for disabled veterans now this</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="3.12">isn&amp;#39;t interesting</text>
  <text start="268.32" dur="4.89">think it&amp;#39;s like a trial period almost I</text>
  <text start="270.87" dur="4.29">think because just the student loan debt</text>
  <text start="273.21" dur="3.42">is a big deal okay if he wipes out</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="2.94">student loan debt for one group it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="276.63" dur="4.05">quite possible he would do refer other</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="4.41">groups now disabled veterans that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="280.68" dur="3.09">quick way to kind of get your foot in</text>
  <text start="282.51" dur="3">the door but what if he were to offer</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="4.56">that for a larger audience like the</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="5.31">Millennials come 20 20 that&amp;#39;s a vote</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="4.62">changer that is a vote we turn in the</text>
  <text start="290.82" dur="3.75">big way now look I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="2.88">necessarily fair because the taxpayer</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="3.69">will then foot the bill for everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.83" dur="5.97">bad student loan debt and then horrible</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="5.85">poor life decisions but it would be a</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="4.83">powerful vote winner and it would</text>
  <text start="304.11" dur="5.64">basically landslide what will you</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="6.36">support the left still has so continuing</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="6">on we also have from the new American we</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="5.25">have Prince Andrew was flying on Lolita</text>
  <text start="315.75" dur="4.62">Express the flight logs and the palace</text>
  <text start="318.24" dur="4.71">records appear to back Epstein&amp;#39;s victims</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="4.74">claim so this is one of many other</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="4.74">powerful perverts getting exposed now</text>
  <text start="325.11" dur="4.86">for their being involved with children</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="4.23">and it&amp;#39;s good to see that that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="3.96">out of course Epstein&amp;#39;s mysterious</text>
  <text start="331.92" dur="3.66">suicide had nothing to do with all of</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="3.71">these powerful people being exposed for</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="5.01">child trafficking nothing at all</text>
  <text start="337.64" dur="5.53">we also have speaking of powerful people</text>
  <text start="340.59" dur="5.4">and kind of the elite corruption going</text>
  <text start="343.17" dur="5.4">on scaramouche II as recently as you may</text>
  <text start="345.99" dur="4.26">have heard flipped on Trump now he is</text>
  <text start="348.57" dur="4.41">seen partying with Rothschild and other</text>
  <text start="350.25" dur="5.13">elites and basically hanging out at Bill</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="3.6">Clinton&amp;#39;s birthday bash and was even I</text>
  <text start="355.38" dur="3.39">think quoted as saying something about</text>
  <text start="356.58" dur="4.02">Democrats have more fun or something and</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="3.18">then guess what he&amp;#39;s now accusing Trump</text>
  <text start="360.6" dur="3.81">for being a fascist everything else so I</text>
  <text start="361.95" dur="5.52">guess he was part of the club or paid</text>
  <text start="364.41" dur="7.26">off whatever happened he turned fast who</text>
  <text start="367.47" dur="5.79">cares that&amp;#39;s just the game of Thrones</text>
  <text start="371.67" dur="4.38">you never know who you can really trust</text>
  <text start="373.26" dur="5.22">in this role now this is also very</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="4.89">interesting the Palestinian president is</text>
  <text start="378.48" dur="6.75">vowing to invade Jerusalem with millions</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="6.45">of fighters millions of fighters that is</text>
  <text start="385.23" dur="3.36">wild so if that were the case at the</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="3.21">bridge do you see how the Israeli</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="4.8">defense would handle that sort of</text>
  <text start="390.6" dur="4.51">overwhelming number but this just goes</text>
  <text start="393.39" dur="3.82">to the greater</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="4.2">I mean the left has been divided they</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="5.49">have been divided kind of a gay and Jew</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="6.06">versus a Muslim factions now and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="402.7" dur="4.71">openly attacking each other I mean the</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="2.88">Rashida to lave and Alana and more if</text>
  <text start="407.41" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s even a real name</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="5.58">I mean incest Omar who&amp;#39;s probably not</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="5.09">even legal citizen and eventually be</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="6.15">deported or arrested I certainly hope</text>
  <text start="416.58" dur="6.13">these folks are attacking openly some of</text>
  <text start="419.98" dur="5.64">the funding even some of the the biggest</text>
  <text start="422.71" dur="4.77">funders for the left okay so that would</text>
  <text start="425.62" dur="3.33">be you know kind of the leftist Jewish</text>
  <text start="427.48" dur="3.78">party there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s people in the</text>
  <text start="428.95" dur="3.87">right that are Jewish as well but kind</text>
  <text start="431.26" dur="5.19">of in the the halls of power and</text>
  <text start="432.82" dur="5.76">politics and education and entertainment</text>
  <text start="436.45" dur="4.11">all that stuff it&amp;#39;s obviously as we know</text>
  <text start="438.58" dur="4.62">primarily on the left so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.56" dur="4.62">interesting to see that and Bill Maher</text>
  <text start="443.2" dur="4.17">kind of worked back at appreciate it too</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="3.96">late if you want a boycott you know</text>
  <text start="447.37" dur="3.87">ninety-three percent of your party go</text>
  <text start="449.14" dur="3.87">right ahead and yet a pointed out there</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;re dividing and they&amp;#39;re destroying</text>
  <text start="453.01" dur="5.52">their own party they&amp;#39;re eating their own</text>
  <text start="454.48" dur="6.5">as they say now we also have our BG</text>
  <text start="458.53" dur="5.07">Ginsburg supposedly still alive</text>
  <text start="460.98" dur="5.44">underwent three weeks radiation for a</text>
  <text start="463.6" dur="4.14">malignant tumor if you believe it</text>
  <text start="466.42" dur="2.73">because I still haven&amp;#39;t seen proof of</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="3.63">life every time a video comes out</text>
  <text start="469.15" dur="4.73">supposedly a proof of life video it has</text>
  <text start="471.37" dur="6.54">been a clearly edited clearly provably</text>
  <text start="473.88" dur="5.65">demonstrably edited in fact it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="477.91" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re sending their amateurs</text>
  <text start="479.53" dur="3.12">or something it&amp;#39;s like if you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="481" dur="3.66">try to fake a Supreme Court justice</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="3.75">something alive and is indeed what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.66" dur="3.81">happening you think they would send</text>
  <text start="486.4" dur="3.87">their a-game I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that we</text>
  <text start="488.47" dur="3.48">have people on fiber into a better job</text>
  <text start="490.27" dur="4.44">of faking videos and some of these folks</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="5.1">have done so far but if it is indeed the</text>
  <text start="494.71" dur="4.5">case that she is true and are truly</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="5.99">alive then it won&amp;#39;t be for much longer</text>
  <text start="499.21" dur="6.09">because this is a malignant pancreas</text>
  <text start="503.04" dur="6.13">it&amp;#39;s not a good kind of cancer to get I</text>
  <text start="505.3" dur="5.31">think Reata cancer this Melissa if she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.17" dur="2.58">still alive and remember we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="3">videos come out where her throat</text>
  <text start="511.75" dur="3.78">suddenly was fleshed out and twice as</text>
  <text start="513.61" dur="3.39">thick we&amp;#39;ve seen videos come out where</text>
  <text start="515.53" dur="4.199">people are walking in front of her and</text>
  <text start="517" dur="4.56">behind her when there&amp;#39;s no space in</text>
  <text start="519.729" dur="5.131">front and they&amp;#39;re both blurry in front</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="5.1">and behind abnormally and you know just</text>
  <text start="524.86" dur="3.11">there&amp;#39;s no recognition the shadows are</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="3.049">off I mean it</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="3.719">people are walking through other objects</text>
  <text start="529.709" dur="3.75">like other people and ropes and stuff in</text>
  <text start="531.689" dur="3.45">that video I mean this is just what I</text>
  <text start="533.459" dur="4.62">remember from the top of my head</text>
  <text start="535.139" dur="4.531">so these videos are complete BS I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="538.079" dur="4.11">think she&amp;#39;s still alive but I&amp;#39;m open to</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="3.45">seeing some evidence you know no I think</text>
  <text start="542.189" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re just trying to keep it going</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="3.839">until 2020 that&amp;#39;s try to slow Trump down</text>
  <text start="545.189" dur="4.621">as much as can because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>

  <text start="748.039" dur="2.78">don&amp;#39;t know if I can here</text>
  <text start="756.12" dur="4.62">and so with respect to unmasking for the</text>
  <text start="758.67" dur="4.41">National Security Agency we define in</text>
  <text start="760.74" dur="4.92">writing who has the authority to unmask</text>
  <text start="763.08" dur="4.92">a u.s. person identity that is 20</text>

  <text start="770.19" dur="4.41">positions the director we outline in</text>
  <text start="772.44" dur="4.89">writing what are the criteria that will</text>
  <text start="774.6" dur="4.32">be applied to a request to unmask when</text>
  <text start="777.33" dur="3.24">we think we need to reference a u.s.</text>
  <text start="778.92" dur="3.57">person in a report we will not use a</text>
  <text start="780.57" dur="4.65">name we will not use an identity we say</text>
  <text start="782.49" dur="4.7">us person one u.s. person to us person</text>
  <text start="785.22" dur="4.56">three that report is then promulgated</text>
  <text start="787.19" dur="4.51">some of the recipients of that report</text>
  <text start="789.78" dur="3.63">will sometimes come back to us and say</text>
  <text start="791.7" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;m trying to understand what I am</text>
  <text start="793.41" dur="4.71">reading could you help me understand who</text>
  <text start="795.9" dur="3.9">is person one or who is person two etc</text>
  <text start="798.12" dur="3.81">you must make the request in writing the</text>
  <text start="799.8" dur="3.87">request must be made on the basis of</text>
  <text start="801.93" dur="2.88">your official duties not the fact that</text>
  <text start="803.67" dur="3.09">you just find this report really</text>
  <text start="804.81" dur="5.7">interesting and you&amp;#39;re just curious the</text>
  <text start="806.76" dur="6.84">basis of the request must be that you</text>
  <text start="810.51" dur="5.01">need this identity to understand the</text>
  <text start="813.6" dur="4.44">intelligence you read we apply those</text>
  <text start="815.52" dur="4.95">three criterion we do it in writing and</text>
  <text start="818.04" dur="5.97">one of those 20 individuals then agrees</text>
  <text start="820.47" dur="5.73">or disagrees and if we unmask we go back</text>
  <text start="824.01" dur="4.17">to that entity who requested it not</text>
  <text start="826.2" dur="4.14">every individual who received the report</text>
  <text start="828.18" dur="4.17">we then provide them the u.s. identity</text>
  <text start="830.34" dur="4.23">and we also remind them the</text>
  <text start="832.35" dur="4.35">classification of this report in the</text>
  <text start="834.57" dur="4.77">sensitive sensitivity of that identity</text>
  <text start="836.7" dur="4.68">remains in place by revealing this u.s.</text>
  <text start="839.34" dur="5.19">person to you we are doing it to help</text>
  <text start="841.38" dur="5.43">you understand the intelligence not not</text>
  <text start="844.53" dur="3.15">so that you can use that knowledge thing</text>
  <text start="846.81" dur="2.85">to screaming</text>
  <text start="847.68" dur="3.99">it must remain appropriately protected</text>
  <text start="849.66" dur="4.2">so there&amp;#39;s a record of who made the</text>
  <text start="851.67" dur="4.44">request to unmask the conversation</text>
  <text start="853.86" dur="3.72">involving the American citizen yes sir</text>
  <text start="856.11" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s a record of whether or not you</text>

  <text start="878.42" dur="4.359">is a crime and that&amp;#39;s a leak and that is</text>
  <text start="881.01" dur="3.69">illegal yes sir okay this is not about</text>
  <text start="882.779" dur="4.141">politics is not about party this is</text>

  <text start="900.3" dur="4.08">gonna get good now we also have</text>
  <text start="902.58" dur="4.02">interestingly because you know this</text>
  <text start="904.38" dur="4.23">thing look like basically just a big PR</text>
  <text start="906.6" dur="3.57">thing and I still think it is I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="908.61" dur="2.97">think she&amp;#39;ll win it and I definitely not</text>
  <text start="910.17" dur="2.64">think she&amp;#39;ll get three billion dollars</text>

  <text start="912.81" dur="5.88">suing for I wish that she did because</text>
  <text start="916.26" dur="4.44">big tech certainly doesn&amp;#39;t deserve any</text>
  <text start="918.69" dur="3.69">of that money it&amp;#39;s a government monopoly</text>
  <text start="920.7" dur="3.93">that gave it to them and they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="922.38" dur="4.32">it against the American people but</text>
  <text start="924.63" dur="4.709">interestingly enough they are going to</text>

  <text start="935.339" dur="3.69">the same lawsuit we were talking about</text>
  <text start="936.69" dur="5.31">before I was there when she announced it</text>

  <text start="946.58" dur="4.86">you know she&amp;#39;d I don&amp;#39;t think it was for</text>
  <text start="948.69" dur="6.06">censorship I think it was very bad</text>
  <text start="951.44" dur="6.01">slander or something of that nature for</text>
  <text start="954.75" dur="5.55">lying about her but still hopefully she</text>
  <text start="957.45" dur="6.66">will win something and punish them we</text>
  <text start="960.3" dur="5.13">also have and this is a very big deal if</text>
  <text start="964.11" dur="3.87">you think about it especially from</text>
  <text start="965.43" dur="6.69">someone as well-known and influential as</text>
  <text start="967.98" dur="5.31">overstock CEO all right so burn I think</text>

  <text start="1000.399" dur="4.56">Clinton also may have been spying on us</text>
