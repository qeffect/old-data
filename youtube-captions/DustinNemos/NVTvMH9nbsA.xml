  <text start="32.989" dur="4.491">today&amp;#39;s world because guns are basically</text>
  <text start="35.57" dur="4.14">the topic on everyone&amp;#39;s agenda</text>

  <text start="69.979" dur="5.851">testosterone and blood and guts and</text>
  <text start="72.5" dur="6.42">glory but it&amp;#39;s an important story that</text>
  <text start="75.83" dur="5.91">was kind of over dramatized I think with</text>
  <text start="78.92" dur="6.3">the you know the spray paint abs but it</text>
  <text start="81.74" dur="5.82">is an important story between tyranny</text>

  <text start="125.929" dur="7.291">so Mullen Labe of course is the probably</text>
  <text start="130.55" dur="6.18">the most well known of all of the</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="5.43">laconic phrases now it the wikipedia</text>
  <text start="136.73" dur="5.43">says that it is a classical expression</text>
  <text start="138.65" dur="5.05">of defiance according to Plutarch Xerxes</text>
  <text start="142.16" dur="3.88">the first king</text>

  <text start="150.12" dur="4.949">king leonidas the first responded with</text>
  <text start="152.28" dur="10.679">this phrase it is an exemplary use of a</text>
  <text start="155.069" dur="9.271">laconic phrase so to give you an idea of</text>
  <text start="162.959" dur="3.211">the Spartans</text>
  <text start="164.34" dur="4.05">people always assumed that this was like</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="4.47">the warrior class of ancient Greece that</text>
  <text start="168.39" dur="4.02">they were kind of the dumb brutes they</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="3.989">were the fighters and then Athens was</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="4.139">the scholars and everything else well it</text>
  <text start="174.629" dur="4.711">turns out that&amp;#39;s not entirely true</text>
  <text start="176.549" dur="6.361">all right the Spartans were actually</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="5.52">incredibly wise even to the point of</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="5.97">being incredibly humble and remaining</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="5.4">fairly poor intentionally and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="3.87">go through some of the other laconic</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="4.52">phrases that I like so just a list of my</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="4.59">favorites and give you guys an example</text>
  <text start="194.78" dur="4.72">kind of an insight into the Spartan</text>
  <text start="197.34" dur="4.92">mindset and I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="4.14">parallels and and modern time to then</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="6.09">and a lot of things that we can learn</text>
  <text start="203.64" dur="8.429">from the Spartans one witticism that was</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="6.93">attributed to les urges the legendary</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="6.601">lawgiver of Sparta was a response to a</text>
  <text start="215.28" dur="5.16">proposal to set up a democracy there as</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="3.93">we know democracy is bad</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="3.6">democracy is a mob rule it&amp;#39;s two wolves</text>
  <text start="222.6" dur="4.979">and a sheep voting on what&amp;#39;s for dinner</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="7.02">a republic with a second amendment like</text>
  <text start="227.579" dur="6.81">we have gun protections is the Sheep</text>
  <text start="231.06" dur="7.47">having a gun and contesting that vote</text>
  <text start="234.389" dur="6.541">okay so his response to the idea that</text>
  <text start="238.53" dur="6.269">they created democracy was begin with</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="8.79">your own family right because if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="244.799" dur="6.78">ever tried to do things on a vote with</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="4.47">your family you&amp;#39;ll realize how chaotic</text>
  <text start="251.579" dur="5.761">and much you know hectic that would be</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="6.09">right most families function better with</text>
  <text start="257.34" dur="5.52">a leader traditionally it was the head</text>
  <text start="260.28" dur="8.52">of the household maybe the the parents</text>
  <text start="262.86" dur="8.77">or the father the older people perhaps a</text>
  <text start="268.8" dur="6.16">large family it would be a council</text>
  <text start="271.63" dur="4.77">perhaps the the heads with the parents</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="2.91">you know the mother and the father or</text>
  <text start="276.4" dur="3.42">perhaps it would be just the father you</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="4.02">know I&amp;#39;m not saying that it has to be</text>
  <text start="279.82" dur="3.54">just men I&amp;#39;m seeing that that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="281.89" dur="6.39">how it worked out traditionally and it</text>
  <text start="283.36" dur="6.54">worked fairly well in most cases yes it</text>
  <text start="288.28" dur="4.98">was a little oppressive for young people</text>
  <text start="289.9" dur="5.31">and that was probably a good thing as</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="3.57">young people that you know they tend to</text>
  <text start="295.21" dur="4.11">make stupid mistakes and their parents</text>
  <text start="296.83" dur="4.26">kind to have the most incentive of</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="4.41">anyone to keep them from making stupid</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="5.49">mistakes so I thought this was a really</text>
  <text start="303.73" dur="6.51">good response and there are modern</text>
  <text start="306.58" dur="5.58">parallels between the left who keeps</text>
  <text start="310.24" dur="3.9">using the word democracy like we somehow</text>
  <text start="312.16" dur="3.96">live in one they just think that if they</text>
  <text start="314.14" dur="3.57">keep repeating the phrase democracy</text>
  <text start="316.12" dur="3.81">democracy they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll convince us</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="3.9">all that we&amp;#39;re in a democracy even</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="4.35">though we are in a republic and that is</text>
  <text start="321.61" dur="4.68">nowhere near the same thing in a</text>
  <text start="324.28" dur="3.93">republic the sheep is protected from the</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="8.27">wolves doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many more</text>
  <text start="328.21" dur="8.79">voters the wolves have now another</text>
  <text start="334.56" dur="7.54">another problem with our role today is</text>
  <text start="337" dur="8.34">that in my opinion most men are weak all</text>
  <text start="342.1" dur="5.88">right and I think the women had also</text>
  <text start="345.34" dur="5.36">have a part to play in that now let me</text>
  <text start="347.98" dur="5.55">give you an example of Spartan women and</text>
  <text start="350.7" dur="5.62">you decide whether or not you think it</text>
  <text start="353.53" dur="5.31">would make stronger men Spartan mothers</text>
  <text start="356.32" dur="5.72">or wives gave a departing warrior his</text>
  <text start="358.84" dur="4.95">shield with the words with it or on it</text>
  <text start="362.04" dur="4.51">implying that he should return</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="6.27">victoriously with his shield or his dead</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="5.73">body on it but by no means after saving</text>
  <text start="370.06" dur="6.39">himself by throwing away his shield and</text>
  <text start="372.28" dur="7.2">flee so your old mother would reject you</text>
  <text start="376.45" dur="6.93">from society if you were a coward okay</text>
  <text start="379.48" dur="5.49">imagine if we had strong families with</text>
  <text start="383.38" dur="4.14">mothers that would reject their own</text>
  <text start="384.97" dur="4.32">children for cowardice in today&amp;#39;s world</text>
  <text start="387.52" dur="3.09">we would not have cowardice we would</text>
  <text start="389.29" dur="4.86">have brave people willing to stand</text>
  <text start="390.61" dur="5.82">against injustice and immorality instead</text>
  <text start="394.15" dur="4.12">we can&amp;#39;t even be bothered to prote like</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="3.82">to effectively</text>
  <text start="398.27" dur="3.66">tax protests or things like that we just</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="2.99">would pay our tax bills you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="3.54">dealing with that crap right now I</text>
  <text start="403.24" dur="4.81">really don&amp;#39;t want to pay it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="4.47">unconstitutional it&amp;#39;s illegal there are</text>
  <text start="408.05" dur="4.17">many arguments that would actually hold</text>
  <text start="409.94" dur="5.58">up in a legitimate courtroom that the</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="5.16">tax does not apply to all of us it only</text>
  <text start="415.52" dur="6.03">applies to businesses constitutionally</text>
  <text start="417.38" dur="5.79">speaking not to wages but try to argue</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="3.6">that in court and you&amp;#39;re going jail</text>
  <text start="423.17" dur="3.66">unless you can convince a jury I mean</text>
  <text start="425.15" dur="3.15">that has happened there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="5.85">people that have convinced juries and</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="6.54">shown the truth to the jury so imagine</text>
  <text start="432.68" dur="4.35">that sort of warrior mentality now sort</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="5.25">of we&amp;#39;re not gonna take BS no matter</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="6.68">what even if it kills us mentality that</text>
  <text start="440.09" dur="8.37">is why they had freedom and we do not</text>
  <text start="443.71" dur="6.79">when here&amp;#39;s another one when an athenian</text>
  <text start="448.46" dur="4.02">accused spartans of being ignorant</text>
  <text start="450.5" dur="5.31">you know Athens vs. Sparta was always</text>
  <text start="452.48" dur="6.12">that that the historical paradigm it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="5.97">always those two in the movies or Troy</text>
  <text start="458.6" dur="5.28">which is different so when an Athenian</text>
  <text start="461.78" dur="6.06">accused Spartans of being ignorant the</text>
  <text start="463.88" dur="6.84">Spartan placed Owen acts I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="467.84" dur="4.77">that right I&amp;#39;m sure agreed he said what</text>
  <text start="470.72" dur="3.57">you say is true we alone of all the</text>
  <text start="472.61" dur="6.45">Greeks have learned none of your evil</text>
  <text start="474.29" dur="7.08">ways now I see a lot of comparisons here</text>
  <text start="479.06" dur="3.84">between the modern left and right okay</text>
  <text start="481.37" dur="3.51">they consider themselves to be more</text>
  <text start="482.9" dur="4.56">educated which in many cases is true</text>
  <text start="484.88" dur="4.74">many of them are college educated not</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="4.41">saying that the right or not but they</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="6.27">sort of pride themselves on papers and</text>
  <text start="491.87" dur="6.03">degrees and and awards and things like</text>
  <text start="495.89" dur="5.25">that which is actually ironically the</text>
  <text start="497.9" dur="6.47">sign of a lower IQ lower IQ people tend</text>
  <text start="501.14" dur="3.23">to have more value in</text>
  <text start="505.539" dur="6.09">ranks or merits or accomplishments of</text>
  <text start="509.68" dur="4.95">that nature like if you&amp;#39;re a doctor</text>
  <text start="511.629" dur="4.801">you&amp;#39;ll be taken more seriously by people</text>
  <text start="514.63" dur="4.44">that can&amp;#39;t think for themselves then</text>
  <text start="516.43" dur="4.169">someone who can like I I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="519.07" dur="3.149">I&amp;#39;m the smartest guy in the world but</text>
  <text start="520.599" dur="3.211">just because you&amp;#39;re a doctor doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="522.219" dur="3.211">mean anything to me like you you might</text>
  <text start="523.81" dur="3.54">have been the last guy in your class to</text>
  <text start="525.43" dur="3.99">finish they still call you doctor</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="3.989">right you could have had the worst grade</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="4.44">in the whole school barely passed like</text>
  <text start="531.339" dur="7.021">Deepti - or something and you they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="533.86" dur="8.55">still doctor right so I have often ended</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="6">up in the situation where I&amp;#39;m taking the</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="4.679">side of science and evidence and reason</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="4.83">versus a doctor or a nurse I&amp;#39;ve debated</text>
  <text start="547.089" dur="5.761">a couple of these in my time about</text>
  <text start="549.19" dur="5.22">things like vaccines you know you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="552.85" dur="3.84">have to go to school for a four to eight</text>
  <text start="554.41" dur="5.22">years or more to be able to read recent</text>
  <text start="556.69" dur="7.11">studies okay it&amp;#39;s just not that</text>
  <text start="559.63" dur="8.699">complicated and I have only ever met</text>
  <text start="563.8" dur="6.09">maybe two doctors that actually kept up</text>
  <text start="568.329" dur="6.181">with kind of the more recent evidence</text>
  <text start="569.89" dur="7.05">okay so in in in the cases of specific</text>
  <text start="574.51" dur="5.4">things that I research you know vaccines</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="5.519">being one of them I am probably more</text>
  <text start="579.91" dur="5.609">well educated than the doctors not</text>
  <text start="582.459" dur="4.711">bragging just because I actually read</text>
  <text start="585.519" dur="3.57">what&amp;#39;s recurrent and what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="2.88">what&amp;#39;s happening and I&amp;#39;ve actually put</text>
  <text start="589.089" dur="5.911">study into it</text>
  <text start="590.05" dur="8.909">whereas doctors have a kind of a</text>
  <text start="595" dur="5.55">spoon-fed industry-standard education</text>
  <text start="598.959" dur="5.851">about it which I&amp;#39;m sure they learn a lot</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="7.289">of lies in fact I know they do but they</text>
  <text start="604.81" dur="4.5">aren&amp;#39;t very well adept at debate when it</text>
  <text start="607.839" dur="4.381">comes to anything outside of that</text>
  <text start="609.31" dur="4.23">education so they got their version and</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="3.57">then they kind of just quit learning</text>
  <text start="613.54" dur="3.57">about the topic and then they refuse to</text>
  <text start="615.79" dur="6.539">learn about anything that doesn&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="617.11" dur="9.539">with it very very few people are more</text>
  <text start="622.329" dur="8.161">defensive and and angry when challenged</text>
  <text start="626.649" dur="6.901">than doctors and nurses it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="630.49" dur="5.61">I think that there comes with with that</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="3.36">many years of education and that much</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="3.18">steam</text>
  <text start="636.91" dur="6.36">from society like they get a lot of oh</text>
  <text start="639.28" dur="8.07">you&amp;#39;re a doctor I think a lot of that so</text>
  <text start="643.27" dur="7.14">their ego is built up and obviously the</text>
  <text start="647.35" dur="5.78">bigger the ego the greater the pride the</text>
  <text start="650.41" dur="6.03">greater the fall when you&amp;#39;re wrong and</text>
  <text start="653.13" dur="5.35">that is an unfortunate situation and I</text>
  <text start="656.44" dur="5.85">think the ego is what stops many of our</text>
  <text start="658.48" dur="8.72">doctors from being healers actually</text>
  <text start="662.29" dur="8.25">being quite the opposite okay so a</text>
  <text start="667.2" dur="7.15">visitor to Sparta expressed surprise at</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="6.93">the plain clothing of King Agis so a</text>
  <text start="674.35" dur="4.35">jacilla said Jessa &amp;#39;list I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="4.37">how to say these names they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="678.7" dur="6.72">awesome though and other Spartans a</text>
  <text start="681.84" dur="6.22">jealous hey Jess Alice remarked from</text>
