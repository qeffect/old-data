  <text start="0.62" dur="5.739">anyway part two I got interrupted there</text>
  <text start="3.03" dur="7.2">but part two of that basically just to</text>
  <text start="6.359" dur="5.49">finish up my thoughts really is that the</text>
  <text start="10.23" dur="3.3">queue movement has undergone a lot of</text>
  <text start="11.849" dur="4.801">transformation it&amp;#39;s undergone a lot of</text>
  <text start="13.53" dur="5.85">growth but now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s also undergoing</text>
  <text start="16.65" dur="8.28">a lot of refinement and by that I mean</text>
  <text start="19.38" dur="7.08">that you know people are ok so the</text>
  <text start="24.93" dur="3.96">negative side of that is factionalism</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="4.26">where we go one we all has factionalism</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="3.63">in it now and there there has been split</text>
  <text start="30.72" dur="3.33">factions that that don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="32.52" dur="6">like each other and things like that and</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="6.57">it&amp;#39;s a very unfortunate situation but on</text>
  <text start="38.52" dur="3.3">the positive side the refinement means</text>
  <text start="40.62" dur="3.93">that we&amp;#39;re getting better what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="41.82" dur="5.19">doing we&amp;#39;re making allies we&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="44.55" dur="4.32">connections you guys know you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="47.01" dur="3.42">bad about doing videos I didn&amp;#39;t even do</text>
  <text start="48.87" dur="3.27">much video from the priority I should</text>
  <text start="50.43" dur="2.76">have interviewed people you know sort of</text>
  <text start="52.14" dur="3.66">itch and all these other people were</text>
  <text start="53.19" dur="4.889">there but that&amp;#39;s not usually my thing</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="5.009">I&amp;#39;m not a field reporter I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="4.381">much about it and I&amp;#39;m not like I feel</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="3">uncomfortable waiting in line chasing</text>
  <text start="62.46" dur="4.68">people down to try to get them on a</text>
  <text start="63.809" dur="5.161">50-second soundbite or clip I try to</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="4.38">respect people&amp;#39;s space and just kind of</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="5.64">be that guy that gets it you know and</text>
  <text start="71.52" dur="4.889">I&amp;#39;m more polite like for example I was</text>
  <text start="74.61" dur="3.06">very casual about stefan molyneux i</text>
  <text start="76.409" dur="4.771">ended up hanging out with him for 30</text>
  <text start="77.67" dur="5.25">minutes at the laste MP by myself alone</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="3.6">he was just on stage kind of prepping</text>
  <text start="82.92" dur="4.199">and we got to hang out for about 30</text>
  <text start="84.78" dur="4.47">minutes and I was at one of the junkies</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="4.021">or not drunk he&amp;#39;s the the flunkies you</text>
  <text start="89.25" dur="3.869">know the the people that that had to</text>
  <text start="91.14" dur="4.86">just get in and get the picture and all</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="4.29">offense to them but and that kind of a</text>
  <text start="96" dur="5.48">casual approach has worked for me very</text>
  <text start="97.409" dur="5.781">well with networking but because of</text>
  <text start="101.48" dur="3.96">platform I&amp;#39;ve been given in the reach</text>
  <text start="103.19" dur="4.65">that I have and and and that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="105.44" dur="4.59">because of you guys out there I&amp;#39;m now</text>
  <text start="107.84" dur="4.07">able to go to these events I&amp;#39;m treated</text>
  <text start="110.03" dur="4.89">with respect as an important person</text>
  <text start="111.91" dur="4.3">because of that voice and that reach IV</text>
  <text start="114.92" dur="3.09">asleep eat everyone wants something</text>
  <text start="116.21" dur="4.08">right so you know I have something for</text>
  <text start="118.01" dur="5.51">them now I have reach so because of you</text>
  <text start="120.29" dur="6.12">guys I now have like this this</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="4.599">bargaining chip I guess in the circles</text>
  <text start="126.41" dur="3.72">of influence and power and that means</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="4.561">that I can go to these places and make</text>
  <text start="130.13" dur="5.55">friends with other people that have you</text>
  <text start="132.68" dur="4.5">know the similar sort of thing and we</text>
  <text start="135.68" dur="3.51">can build alliances we can build</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="4.05">coalitions we can have discussions and</text>
  <text start="139.19" dur="4.62">deep debates we can we can learn from</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="5.85">one another and we can help one another</text>
  <text start="143.81" dur="6.78">to support our president because the Q</text>
  <text start="147.08" dur="5.55">thing is is they give the Q thing not as</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="7.14">its own movement think if the Q thing is</text>
  <text start="152.63" dur="7.11">like an extra badge on your uniform if</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="3.81">you&amp;#39;re a Magus soldier basically like</text>
  <text start="159.74" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;ve gone up a rank that you&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="5.43">the the extra arrows or the extra</text>
  <text start="164.42" dur="4.65">stripes that&amp;#39;s basically what Q is about</text>
  <text start="166.97" dur="4.05">you you&amp;#39;ve instead of just being a</text>
  <text start="169.07" dur="4.53">citizen who supports our president</text>
  <text start="171.02" dur="4.8">you&amp;#39;ve taken the the role of citizen</text>
  <text start="173.6" dur="4.26">journalists which is what Q is about I</text>
  <text start="175.82" dur="5.52">think it&amp;#39;s about breaking the media he</text>
  <text start="177.86" dur="4.05">said break the MSM I love that still</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="3.52">working on it</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="6.91">we&amp;#39;ve done a good job so far</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="6.69">and he he put out all this open source a</text>
  <text start="188.82" dur="4.74">Socratic method investigation stuff open</text>
  <text start="191.55" dur="3.78">source intelligence and it trained</text>
  <text start="193.56" dur="3">millions of investigative journalists</text>
  <text start="195.33" dur="4.14">and to train millions of citizen</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="4.74">journalists like myself for now taking</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="6.63">it to the media and feeding them</text>
  <text start="201.3" dur="6.63">breaking them politically speaking so</text>
  <text start="206.1" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s what you know in my heart I think</text>
  <text start="207.93" dur="2.82">the main point of the queue thing was</text>
  <text start="209.49" dur="3.12">about obviously there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="4.47">tertiary benefits and side points as</text>
  <text start="212.61" dur="6.78">well and it&amp;#39;s part of the is part of the</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="8.85">overall plan to just galvanize people</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="7.68">and bring them together but if it did</text>
  <text start="224.07" dur="4.74">nothing other than create a new class of</text>
  <text start="227.07" dur="3.6">media citizen journalists the ones that</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="4.53">are not yet bought out independently if</text>
  <text start="230.67" dur="4.59">you will you know the ones that are not</text>
  <text start="233.34" dur="7.53">yet bought out and corrupted if it only</text>
  <text start="235.26" dur="7.23">did that and by training them breaking</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="2.94">the media those two things queue</text>
  <text start="242.49" dur="4.23">movement would have been massively</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="6.78">successful but it&amp;#39;s going to do more</text>
  <text start="246.72" dur="8.01">than that it&amp;#39;s gonna get people into</text>
  <text start="250.59" dur="6.36">office it&amp;#39;s gonna hold globalist leftist</text>
  <text start="254.73" dur="4.25">companies accountable by you know</text>
  <text start="256.95" dur="4.77">boycotting them and refusing to spend</text>
  <text start="258.98" dur="4.21">you know we have we have millions of</text>
  <text start="261.72" dur="3.24">people in this movement we spend</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="3.57">billions of dollars every year why the</text>
  <text start="264.96" dur="4.53">hell are we spending that with companies</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="5.37">like Google and Facebook because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="4.08">no other option but that&amp;#39;s not gonna be</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="3.81">there much longer we already have other</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="4.41">options coming and we have a movement of</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="4.34">millions of people all we got to do is</text>
  <text start="277.98" dur="5.04">figure out where to go at this point and</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="5.02">maybe president trumple&amp;#39;s will jump ship</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="4.649">over somewhere else and then just</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="4.8">abandon Twitter you know like parlor or</text>
  <text start="287.669" dur="6.541">something like that and maybe it will</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="8.1">I think he will at some point but um</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="5.97">that&amp;#39;s kind of that&amp;#39;s kind of my point I</text>
  <text start="298.2" dur="5.13">guess I&amp;#39;ve kind of come to it is that</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="5.85">basically we are slowly creeping along</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="5.1">but we&amp;#39;re slowly taking over the</text>
  <text start="306.03" dur="5.13">political body which was the point which</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="5.87">was the goal which was you know to take</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="6.51">back our country and right the wrongs so</text>
  <text start="314.3" dur="5.13">I hope you guys have enjoyed this I hope</text>
  <text start="317.67" dur="4.5">that you found it</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="4.39">it sounds arrogant to say inspirational</text>
  <text start="322.17" dur="3.69">not inspirational but I hope that you</text>
  <text start="323.82" dur="3.57">found it valuable and that your heart&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="3.78">a little bit lighter because I know</text>
  <text start="327.39" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s always doubt we&amp;#39;re in a war here</text>
  <text start="329.64" dur="4.59">against some very evil very powerful</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="3.69">players and they have a lot of options</text>
  <text start="334.23" dur="4.74">in their heart or in their in their</text>
  <text start="336" dur="4.83">arsenal and they have you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="338.97" dur="4.35">money a lot of power a lot of allies and</text>
  <text start="340.83" dur="5.58">of course the media and big tech so you</text>
  <text start="343.32" dur="7.32">know we are facing a serious opponent or</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="5.61">opponents here but despite all that we</text>
  <text start="350.64" dur="3.24">keep winning despite all of that</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="4.59">president Trump keeps winning and I</text>
  <text start="353.88" dur="4.83">think that that is a simple fact or</text>
  <text start="356.61" dur="4.74">simple result of the fact that that man</text>
  <text start="358.71" dur="5.58">understands the art of war and the media</text>
  <text start="361.35" dur="4.71">have been so powerful in the corrupt DC</text>
  <text start="364.29" dur="3.96">class of its so powerful for so long</text>
  <text start="366.06" dur="4.32">that they literally got used to running</text>
  <text start="368.25" dur="5.19">their Democrat playbook the same old</text>
  <text start="370.38" dur="5.22">tired lies and tricks and deceptions the</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="4.56">wrap-up smear the projection the the</text>
  <text start="375.6" dur="4.41">Marxist tactics from rules for radicals</text>
  <text start="378" dur="3.58">all Wolinsky you know dedicated to</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="4.54">Lucifer</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="7.17">hillarie loves that book I was surprised</text>
  <text start="384.55" dur="7.109">so this is all they had and they frankly</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;ve got mica mental muscles you know</text>
  <text start="391.659" dur="3">they haven&amp;#39;t had to flex those in a</text>
  <text start="393.28" dur="3.24">while they haven&amp;#39;t had to really try</text>
  <text start="394.659" dur="2.91">because they had all the power so now</text>
  <text start="396.52" dur="5">they&amp;#39;re at the point where they just</text>
  <text start="397.569" dur="6.06">don&amp;#39;t know what to do and they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="401.52" dur="4.299">they&amp;#39;re using a weapon that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.629" dur="5.461">ineffective versus people that are like</text>
  <text start="405.819" dur="6.181">mentally muscular you know like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.09" dur="4.799">were hardened we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;ve been through</text>
  <text start="412" dur="4.099">the fire the gauntlet we&amp;#39;ve been called</text>
  <text start="413.889" dur="5.37">every sort of ism and it&amp;#39;s there is and</text>
  <text start="416.099" dur="5.41">we don&amp;#39;t care we&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="419.259" dur="4.141">to be like shamed out of telling the</text>
  <text start="421.509" dur="3.331">truth just because you call us a bad</text>
  <text start="423.4" dur="3.259">name or something like that so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="424.84" dur="5.43">tough you know we have to fig skin</text>
  <text start="426.659" dur="5.531">whereas on the other hand you&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="430.27" dur="4.739">left with you know once they run out of</text>
  <text start="432.19" dur="5.849">their their rhetoric and their their</text>
  <text start="435.009" dur="5.011">soundbite you know whatever they heard</text>
  <text start="438.039" dur="4.47">on CNN earlier that day that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="3.989">they&amp;#39;ve got and then they just get angry</text>
  <text start="442.509" dur="4.62">then they just get emotional and they</text>
  <text start="444.009" dur="5.91">just lash out and that is straight to</text>
  <text start="447.129" dur="4.41">cognitive dissonance the only way that I</text>
  <text start="449.919" dur="5.641">know of to effectively get through that</text>
  <text start="451.539" dur="5.731">is with love like you could maybe maybe</text>
  <text start="455.56" dur="3.96">with sincerity and sincerity is very</text>
  <text start="457.27" dur="3.48">powerful you could maybe sincerely talk</text>
  <text start="459.52" dur="3.389">to some of them because many left us</text>
  <text start="460.75" dur="4.61">have big hearts and small brains and you</text>
  <text start="462.909" dur="4.88">can try that route and you could say</text>
  <text start="465.36" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;m sincerely saying I love this country</text>
  <text start="467.789" dur="3.211">I don&amp;#39;t hate anyone in it I know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="469.47" dur="2.819">trying I&amp;#39;m not trying to hurt anyone and</text>
  <text start="471" dur="3.449">I&amp;#39;m not trying to hurt you I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="472.289" dur="3.63">saying that this is what I stand for and</text>
  <text start="474.449" dur="4.081">yet I think that you&amp;#39;ve been lied to</text>
  <text start="475.919" dur="4.231">about it I think that the media maybe or</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="3.569">biased and they don&amp;#39;t tell you the truth</text>
  <text start="480.15" dur="2.91">in there they&amp;#39;re trying to set you and</text>
  <text start="482.099" dur="2.97">give something that they don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="483.06" dur="4.079">with politically I also think that they</text>
  <text start="485.069" dur="4.491">are owned by you know with very few</text>
  <text start="487.139" dur="4.921">small corporations and also China and</text>
  <text start="489.56" dur="5.44">you know that sets a lot of incentive</text>
  <text start="492.06" dur="4.949">against it I think that once you follow</text>
  <text start="495" dur="3.36">the money and you follow some of the the</text>
  <text start="497.009" dur="3.241">stories that they put out you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="498.36" dur="3.929">that all too often they put out lies</text>
  <text start="500.25" dur="4.979">things like that so you could maybe get</text>
  <text start="502.289" dur="5.401">to them especially now because people</text>
  <text start="505.229" dur="4.981">are at the point where they really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="4.529">believe the media they&amp;#39;re angry you know</text>
  <text start="510.21" dur="3.42">the left is angry and maybe they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="512.219" dur="3.24">pretend to believe the media but they</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="3.42">know in their hearts that they got</text>
  <text start="515.459" dur="2.911">nothing if they did they would have</text>
  <text start="517.05" dur="5.06">brought it out by now chef would have</text>
  <text start="518.37" dur="6.149">leaked it by now so if they got nothing</text>
  <text start="522.11" dur="6.43">remember Magga stands for Muller ain&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="524.519" dur="5.731">got anything there they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="528.54" dur="6.32">some of them more of them than ever that</text>
  <text start="530.25" dur="6.44">will be willing to to open their eyes</text>
  <text start="534.86" dur="3.03">but only if you approach him the right</text>
  <text start="536.69" dur="3.06">way and you guys know I&amp;#39;m not normally</text>
  <text start="537.89" dur="3.81">about trying to red pill the left or</text>
  <text start="539.75" dur="4.26">anything like that but we&amp;#39;re entering</text>
  <text start="541.7" dur="3.99">that Great Awakening period where some</text>
  <text start="544.01" dur="3.21">of these human trafficking crimes</text>
  <text start="545.69" dur="3.75">against children and some of the trees</text>
  <text start="547.22" dur="3.99">that are coming out and you know you</text>
  <text start="549.44" dur="3.51">guys tell me all the time someone emails</text>
  <text start="551.21" dur="4.23">me or they writes me they tell me like I</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="5.85">got a brother or father or or my</text>
  <text start="555.44" dur="4.95">children or my family or my friends you</text>
  <text start="558.8" dur="3.3">know I can&amp;#39;t talk to them about this or</text>
  <text start="560.39" dur="3.6">or I&amp;#39;ve tried to red pill them and they</text>

  <text start="739.04" dur="5.849">and and by going there I&amp;#39;ll give you</text>
  <text start="741.889" dur="5.521">guys an example I was in a breakout</text>
  <text start="744.889" dur="4.231">session which is like a small conference</text>
  <text start="747.41" dur="4.77">and it&amp;#39;s on the side of the main</text>
  <text start="749.12" dur="5.79">conference room and Jason Fick who I now</text>
  <text start="752.18" dur="4.95">know big entrepreneur guy on Facebook</text>
  <text start="754.91" dur="3.929">and and he&amp;#39;s had a lot of success in the</text>
  <text start="757.13" dur="3.81">past until Facebook railroaded his</text>
  <text start="758.839" dur="3.42">business told him it was wrong he</text>
  <text start="760.94" dur="2.67">couldn&amp;#39;t use it and then gave his same</text>
  <text start="762.259" dur="3.75">business to someone else and let them</text>
  <text start="763.61" dur="4.11">use it instead was a very different kind</text>
  <text start="766.009" dur="3.421">of situation from what we have been</text>
  <text start="767.72" dur="4.08">typically dealing with with censorship</text>
  <text start="769.43" dur="5.31">but it&amp;#39;s still very important and goes</text>
  <text start="771.8" dur="6.09">sort of the same root causes here</text>
  <text start="774.74" dur="4.74">and and Jason fix this breakout with his</text>
  <text start="777.89" dur="3.33">attorneys there and I got to meet his</text>
  <text start="779.48" dur="3.75">attorney some of the top trial attorneys</text>
  <text start="781.22" dur="3.36">in the country you know you guys know I</text>
  <text start="783.23" dur="3.12">already have Todd McMurtry and he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="784.58" dur="3.54">good one - he&amp;#39;s a super lawyer on the</text>
  <text start="786.35" dur="3.21">stop it burning thing but but these guys</text>
  <text start="788.12" dur="3.99">could share notes with us things like</text>
  <text start="789.56" dur="3.84">that so his attorneys are attorneys and</text>
  <text start="792.11" dur="2.82">some of the other attorneys are out</text>
  <text start="793.4" dur="4.23">there doing like Laura Loomer for hat</text>
  <text start="794.93" dur="5.46">perhaps we could start to really build</text>
  <text start="797.63" dur="4.98">on this every every attack even if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="800.39" dur="4.65">a failure and the courts will build on</text>
  <text start="802.61" dur="5.43">the the last and it&amp;#39;ll just get better</text>
  <text start="805.04" dur="4.17">and better until we went the murder</text>
  <text start="808.04" dur="2.7">Loomer was telling me she thinks we</text>
  <text start="809.21" dur="2.7">could bleed them dry eventually if</text>
  <text start="810.74" dur="4.41">enough people stand up because they</text>
  <text start="811.91" dur="5.91">can&amp;#39;t stop us all right and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="815.15" dur="4.95">truth so while we were having that</text>
  <text start="817.82" dur="3.99">conversation he was giving us his notes</text>
  <text start="820.1" dur="3.42">about his case and how they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="966.839" dur="4.62">that and see it grow maybe maybe we</text>
  <text start="969.75" dur="4.05">could take the demos news network to the</text>
  <text start="971.459" dur="3.87">next level at some point maybe after</text>
  <text start="973.8" dur="3.51">censorship next couple of months when it</text>
  <text start="975.329" dur="3.361">fails because obviously right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="977.31" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s a hard time for everyone</text>
  <text start="978.69" dur="4.889">but maybe we could take it to TV maybe</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="6.06">we could take on the big boys like CNN</text>
  <text start="983.579" dur="5.611">and Fox News which are a fake Magga even</text>
  <text start="987.3" dur="3.42">Trump is going after Fox News now I mean</text>

  <text start="992.94" dur="3.93">Plus 16 percent or something but 16</text>
  <text start="995.13" dur="3.72">points I think it was very large and</text>
  <text start="996.87" dur="3.149">they were cheating for the Dems to make</text>
  <text start="998.85" dur="3.29">it look like people wanted to impeach</text>

  <text start="1011.3" dur="5.64">independence but to bring us to the</text>
  <text start="1014.63" dur="4.53">level where we can effectively on that</text>
  <text start="1016.94" dur="3.6">level compete with something like a CNN</text>
  <text start="1019.16" dur="3.33">he doesn&amp;#39;t take billions at all there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1020.54" dur="3.78">the way they do it we we don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
