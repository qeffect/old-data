  <text start="9.12" dur="5.88">farmland devastated by floods that is</text>
  <text start="12.69" dur="3.96">huge that&amp;#39;s gonna take out a lot of food</text>
  <text start="15" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s actually potentially</text>

  <text start="19.08" dur="4.68">say right here we&amp;#39;ve never seen anything</text>
  <text start="20.58" dur="6.99">like this before so this is going to</text>
  <text start="23.76" dur="6.63">possibly raise the price of at least</text>
  <text start="27.57" dur="5.39">beef but food in general probably as</text>
  <text start="30.39" dur="8.37">many as a million calves lost in</text>
