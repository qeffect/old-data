  <text start="0.74" dur="4">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3" dur="4.47">Mouse and this is your daily manga</text>
  <text start="4.74" dur="5.64">update now we&amp;#39;re gonna start with the</text>
  <text start="7.47" dur="4.379">Omnibus that is probably the most talked</text>
  <text start="10.38" dur="3.2">about issue of the day so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="11.849" dur="5.731">definitely going to address that first</text>
  <text start="13.58" dur="5.98">it is a huge amount of funding for the</text>
  <text start="17.58" dur="4.949">military but other than that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="19.56" dur="5.969">lot of bad stuff in there as well there</text>
  <text start="22.529" dur="4.5">is funding from Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="25.529" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s funding for pay raises for</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="4.92">Congress it was not a good thing</text>
  <text start="29.369" dur="3.931">Schumer and Pelosi are just grinning</text>
  <text start="31.949" dur="5.13">ear-to-ear thinking that they&amp;#39;ve won</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="8.52">some big battle now I&amp;#39;m not gonna claim</text>
  <text start="37.079" dur="6.57">4d chess or anything like that I want to</text>
  <text start="41.82" dur="4.02">see more evidence before I suggest</text>
  <text start="43.649" dur="4.021">something like that however it is</text>
  <text start="45.84" dur="4.46">theoretically possible that Trump could</text>
  <text start="47.67" dur="5.279">use some of that massive funding for</text>
  <text start="50.3" dur="5.02">just having the Army Corps of Engineers</text>
  <text start="52.949" dur="3.75">build the wall so he may have just</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="3.39">gotten complete funding for the wall I</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="6.391">don&amp;#39;t know and if you&amp;#39;re following the</text>
  <text start="58.71" dur="6.239">queue and on stuff well a lot of the</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="4.41">wins that they think that they got might</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="5.761">just disappear when the executive order</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="5.4">starts seizing assets and freezing funds</text>
  <text start="70.71" dur="3.75">for different things over the corruption</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="4.32">and stuff and we still have that IG</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="5.94">report coming so I don&amp;#39;t think that we</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="4.649">should abandon the Trump train as many</text>
  <text start="80.4" dur="4.35">people including Ann Coulter who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="4.68">calling for his impeachment now so you</text>
  <text start="84.75" dur="4.2">know I think that he has earned at least</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="4.471">a few weeks of reprieve Before we jump</text>
  <text start="88.95" dur="5.52">to conclusions I mean Trump has done a</text>
  <text start="91.02" dur="4.23">lot of great things for us worth</text>
  <text start="94.47" dur="4.62">mentioning</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="5.159">he has tweeted out before he signed the</text>
  <text start="99.09" dur="3.09">bill he was talking about vetoing the</text>
  <text start="100.409" dur="3.78">bill kind of flip-flopping back and</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="3.54">forth and he had tweeted out that the</text>
  <text start="104.189" dur="3.301">daca recipients have been totally</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="7.41">abandoned by the Democrats and not even</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="8.06">mentioned in the bill and that is part</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="6.11">of a pretty brilliant move I think</text>
  <text start="115.55" dur="6.42">he is basically taking all the steam</text>
  <text start="119.24" dur="5.07">away from the Democrats midterm</text>
  <text start="121.97" dur="4.05">elections about the issue of Dachau</text>
  <text start="124.31" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to play victim</text>
  <text start="126.02" dur="4.77">about that when Trump has been bagging</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="6.63">on Twitter to make a deal to help these</text>
  <text start="130.79" dur="7.2">people so he has in some great strange</text>
  <text start="135.29" dur="4.92">twist of fate gone from the guy who was</text>
  <text start="137.99" dur="3.78">gonna close down the border and and and</text>
  <text start="140.21" dur="4.17">deport all the illegals to now</text>
  <text start="141.77" dur="4.83">championing daca at the same time I mean</text>
  <text start="144.38" dur="5.78">I don&amp;#39;t know how I feel about that I</text>
  <text start="146.6" dur="5.28">want them all kicked out but politically</text>
  <text start="150.16" dur="7.3">strategically that was a pretty</text>
  <text start="151.88" dur="7.08">brilliant move and I do think that you</text>
  <text start="157.46" dur="3.96">know depending on who you talk to but I</text>
  <text start="158.96" dur="4.8">do think the majority of the u.s. does</text>
  <text start="161.42" dur="3.81">feel some sort of responsibility for the</text>
  <text start="163.76" dur="3.21">children that were actually born here</text>
  <text start="165.23" dur="4.77">and and I don&amp;#39;t think that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="166.97" dur="6.69">winning argument to try to deport those</text>
  <text start="170" dur="5.91">people as well I&amp;#39;m all for doing it but</text>
  <text start="173.66" dur="5.16">I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a win and politics</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="5.39">and we do have to kind of think 40</text>
  <text start="178.82" dur="6.48">chicly here not just with our emotions</text>
  <text start="181.3" dur="5.88">my personal reasons I don&amp;#39;t care you</text>
  <text start="185.3" dur="4.17">know I&amp;#39;m not a great respecter of</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="4.87">immoral laws or anything like that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="189.47" dur="7.62">you know I&amp;#39;m voluntary I said only I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="192.05" dur="9.39">not even a republican but let&amp;#39;s face it</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="8.58">it is it is a losing argument to try to</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="6.98">deport a bunch of kids our children not</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="2.75">all of which they are</text>
  <text start="208.52" dur="4.26">but it would be better for the u.s. if</text>
  <text start="210.35" dur="5.01">we did I mean most of these kids did</text>
  <text start="212.78" dur="5.1">come from cultures that were highly</text>
  <text start="215.36" dur="4.77">socialist and low IQ and neither of</text>
  <text start="217.88" dur="7.62">those things are good for the United</text>
  <text start="220.13" dur="7.47">States I&amp;#39;m all for the bygone days of</text>
  <text start="225.5" dur="4.89">taking the best from other countries of</text>
  <text start="227.6" dur="6.32">the world you know based on merit not</text>
  <text start="230.39" dur="6.2">race obviously where when the US was a</text>
  <text start="233.92" dur="6.13">bastion of light and freedom and</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="6.37">opportunity and all that people would</text>
  <text start="240.05" dur="5.22">leave their crappy countries and come to</text>
  <text start="242.96" dur="4.05">the US and we would get this brain drain</text>
  <text start="245.27" dur="4.56">effect where all the really smart people</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="4.26">would would want to come here and those</text>
  <text start="249.83" dur="3.21">people actually contributed to quite a</text>
  <text start="251.27" dur="3.99">lot to society we got some of the</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="6.36">world&amp;#39;s smartest minds here and it</text>
  <text start="255.26" dur="9.06">really helped us to succeed however more</text>
  <text start="259.4" dur="7.56">modern times we see that it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="264.32" dur="5.01">just you know the dredge of humanity and</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="6.3">they they come here wanting the free</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="7.23">stuff and the socialist practices that</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="6.33">Democrats have put in place and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="276.56" dur="5.73">good for us it is a drain on everything</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="5.75">and it actually is a form of eugenics</text>
  <text start="282.29" dur="5.22">after a while because what you tax you</text>
  <text start="285.34" dur="3.91">decrease and what you subsidize you</text>
  <text start="287.51" dur="6">increase so when you tax productive</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="8.85">hierarch you intelligent people to give</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="6.42">free things and subsidize low IQ low</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="5.49">intelligence low information people who</text>
  <text start="299.93" dur="5.1">are going to breed more are versus K</text>
  <text start="303.59" dur="4.83">selective breeding strategies very</text>
  <text start="305.03" dur="5.61">important understand R is basically like</text>
  <text start="308.42" dur="5.58">roaches they just make as many babies as</text>
  <text start="310.64" dur="5.1">they can k is more like a conservative</text>
  <text start="314" dur="4.38">you would want to put more time and</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="5.31">energy into a fewer a number of children</text>
  <text start="318.38" dur="4.74">and get better quality results so there</text>
  <text start="321.05" dur="4.38">are different genetics out there</text>
  <text start="323.12" dur="3.799">different breeding strategies among</text>
  <text start="325.43" dur="5.66">humans and</text>
  <text start="326.919" dur="7.08">when you mass import low IQ socialists</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="4.859">from other cultures many times</text>
  <text start="333.999" dur="5.04">incompatible cultures in mortal cultures</text>
  <text start="335.949" dur="5.43">in some ways you are going to end up</text>
  <text start="339.039" dur="4.321">with a problem</text>
  <text start="341.379" dur="3.481">now when you start taxing the productive</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="3.389">culture to pay for the unproductive</text>
  <text start="344.86" dur="2.88">culture you&amp;#39;re going to end up with a</text>
  <text start="346.749" dur="5.25">bigger problem</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="9.329">every generation that&amp;#39;s why you keep</text>
  <text start="351.999" dur="6.241">hearing that you know the I&amp;#39;m sure that</text>
  <text start="357.069" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;m gonna be called a racist for this</text>
  <text start="358.24" dur="4.679">but the white culture the white race you</text>
  <text start="360.789" dur="4.321">might say even though it&amp;#39;s really like a</text>
  <text start="362.919" dur="4.321">dozen different races they there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="365.11" dur="3.809">one white race you know there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="367.24" dur="5.85">Irish is not the same thing as Nordic</text>
  <text start="368.919" dur="5.43">you know but you can&amp;#39;t tell that to</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="2.849">anyone else because they&amp;#39;ll just call</text>
  <text start="374.349" dur="5.551">you racist cuz white privilege and stuff</text>
  <text start="375.939" dur="6.801">right well when you take those people</text>
  <text start="379.9" dur="5.099">and you hear that they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="382.74" dur="4.09">minority in their own country their own</text>
  <text start="384.999" dur="5.42">culture and the US were expected to be a</text>
  <text start="386.83" dur="8.299">minority here within a generation or two</text>
  <text start="390.419" dur="7.8">you&amp;#39;re looking at a huge socio-economic</text>
  <text start="395.129" dur="6.331">political shift that will be</text>
  <text start="398.219" dur="5.771">irreversible in a very short time so</text>
  <text start="401.46" dur="4.689">that is kind of my reasoning for wanting</text>
  <text start="403.99" dur="5.099">the daca issue wanting as many of them</text>
  <text start="406.149" dur="5.851">expelled as possible back to their own</text>
  <text start="409.089" dur="4.29">cultures where maybe they can actually</text>
  <text start="412" dur="3.99">take what they&amp;#39;ve learned here with the</text>
  <text start="413.379" dur="4.29">free education and improve the world you</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="4.32">know that would be amazing</text>
  <text start="417.669" dur="5.61">the worst thing that you can do you know</text>
  <text start="420.31" dur="6.06">they talk about like colonialism and</text>
  <text start="423.279" dur="4.5">exploiting other countries and taking</text>
  <text start="426.37" dur="3.12">their natural resources well the most</text>
  <text start="427.779" dur="4.711">important natural resource any country</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="5.37">has is its smart people and when they</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="3.69">all come to the US and flee their</text>
  <text start="434.86" dur="3.209">countries because they don&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="436.18" dur="3.389">there what&amp;#39;s gonna happen to those</text>
  <text start="438.069" dur="3.66">countries they&amp;#39;re gonna be filled with</text>
  <text start="439.569" dur="3.9">only the worst and only the dumb and</text>
  <text start="441.729" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re intelligent people that might</text>
  <text start="443.469" dur="2.981">have stayed and made things better came</text>
  <text start="445.479" dur="3.311">here</text>
  <text start="446.45" dur="6.54">and that is why you see a lot of their</text>
  <text start="448.79" dur="8.04">world you know crappy nations and people</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="6.12">that don&amp;#39;t stick around there to change</text>
  <text start="456.83" dur="4.08">things they have a easy option here</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="4.26">where they can get welfare and free</text>
  <text start="460.91" dur="5.58">education everything else so it really</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="6.09">is a matter of economics a matter of</text>
  <text start="466.49" dur="4.77">money a matter of incentives now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.46" dur="3.96">gonna jump on I kind of stayed on that</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="4.59">topic too long but it is great to see</text>
  <text start="473.42" dur="5.13">that Trump is out maneuvering them on</text>
  <text start="475.85" dur="7.47">the docker issue we&amp;#39;ll see what he does</text>
  <text start="478.55" dur="6.93">with it the US and its asia-pacific</text>
  <text start="483.32" dur="5.67">allies are boosting security ties and</text>
  <text start="485.48" dur="5.16">that will piss off China security</text>
  <text start="488.99" dur="4.29">dialogues between the u.s. Japan</text>
  <text start="490.64" dur="4.97">Australia in India aimed at upholding</text>
  <text start="493.28" dur="4.05">regional stability in the asia-pacific</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="4.09">or I think they&amp;#39;re calling an</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="7.11">indo-pacific now will not sit well with</text>
  <text start="499.7" dur="7.61">China link below for that one</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="5.22">Trump did replace McMaster with Bolton</text>
  <text start="507.31" dur="4.24">that&amp;#39;s an interesting move Bolton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.66" dur="4.89">definitely not like a great white hat or</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="8.04">anything but he has made some</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="7.29">interesting remarks in fact I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="519.59" dur="4.02">read you a quote from a tweet from Adam</text>
  <text start="521.84" dur="4.41">Schiff and you can kind of make up your</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="4.68">mind about Bolton just off that John</text>
  <text start="526.25" dur="4.26">Bolton once suggested Russian hack of</text>
  <text start="528.29" dur="3.66">dnc may have been a false flag operation</text>
  <text start="530.51" dur="5.31">by the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="531.95" dur="5.79">he joins Joe D Genova another Fox</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="4.44">contributor who thinks the FBI conspired</text>
  <text start="537.74" dur="4.68">to frame the president allowed to see at</text>
  <text start="540.26" dur="6">POTUS surrounding himself with rational</text>
  <text start="542.42" dur="6.96">thinkers heaven help us it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="5.07">because most of our side was pretty</text>
  <text start="549.38" dur="5.25">skeptical Doulton till they read that</text>
  <text start="551.33" dur="6.8">and now many of us feeling well if Adam</text>
  <text start="554.63" dur="3.5">thinks it&amp;#39;s bad must be good</text>
  <text start="559.369" dur="8.89">the it has come out that the FBI helped</text>
  <text start="565.919" dur="3.96">to carefully plan that tarmac meeting</text>
  <text start="568.259" dur="5.37">between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="569.879" dur="6.031">and then cover it up even going so far</text>
  <text start="573.629" dur="8.58">as to try to target whistleblowers over</text>
  <text start="575.91" dur="8.25">it so in the the plot thickens every day</text>
  <text start="582.209" dur="3.84">it seems like in that that is just you</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="5.179">know saying the plot thickens at this</text>
  <text start="586.049" dur="5.76">point of course it does Dustin of course</text>
  <text start="589.339" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s to be expected at this point but</text>
  <text start="591.809" dur="4.351">we&amp;#39;re gonna keep finding more and more</text>
  <text start="593.579" dur="3.81">dirt on the FBI and I really do hope</text>
  <text start="596.16" dur="5.549">that Trump will get rid of them</text>
  <text start="597.389" dur="10.37">completely disband the FBI entirely and</text>
  <text start="601.709" dur="9.891">the CIA all of the three-letter agencies</text>
  <text start="607.759" dur="6.12">the the EU is pissed about the new</text>
  <text start="611.6" dur="4.049">tariffs you know Trump has the new steel</text>
  <text start="613.879" dur="3.45">and aluminum tariffs which are not</text>
  <text start="615.649" dur="6.27">really about how I think steel is around</text>
  <text start="617.329" dur="8.73">25% aluminum is less he basically is</text>
  <text start="621.919" dur="5.61">using this as as leverage or at least as</text>
  <text start="626.059" dur="3.57">a sign to show that he&amp;#39;s serious because</text>
  <text start="627.529" dur="7.65">these are not massive massive massive</text>
  <text start="629.629" dur="8.221">changes the EU is of course pissed that</text>
  <text start="635.179" dur="4.41">they have higher tariffs on us anyway I</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="3.539">can&amp;#39;t remember off the top of my head</text>
  <text start="639.589" dur="4.381">you can double check this don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="641.389" dur="6.54">quote me but I think that the EU tariffs</text>
  <text start="643.97" dur="6.479">on steel from the US is like 80% it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="647.929" dur="4.26">really high and of course they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="650.449" dur="3.901">mad about it you know macron over in</text>

  <text start="1206.13" dur="7.76">now been removed made harder to find but</text>
  <text start="1210.57" dur="7.44">there were multiple multiple videos of</text>

  <text start="1218.01" dur="6.21">that that that really close and then</text>
  <text start="1220.7" dur="5.74">really far away are even different guns</text>
  <text start="1224.22" dur="4.41">being used you could almost tell the the</text>

  <text start="1315.25" dur="3.42">one</text>
  <text start="1315.58" dur="4.92">and they have lefty victims in the crowd</text>
  <text start="1318.67" dur="4.2">I mean there were probably no real lefty</text>
  <text start="1320.5" dur="5.49">victims in that crowd of conservative</text>
  <text start="1322.87" dur="8.01">country music fans probably all Trump</text>
  <text start="1325.99" dur="7.71">supporters there so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1330.88" dur="5.13">pretty big issue when they are avoiding</text>
  <text start="1333.7" dur="4.35">going after other people that were</text>
  <text start="1336.01" dur="4.86">involved but it is great to see that</text>
  <text start="1338.05" dur="4.65">Loomer soul following that and Congress</text>
  <text start="1340.87" dur="3.39">is being briefed on the issue and Isis</text>
  <text start="1342.7" dur="4.34">did claim it which they rarely ever do</text>
  <text start="1344.26" dur="6.11">if they&amp;#39;re not actually behind it</text>
  <text start="1347.04" dur="6.25">they&amp;#39;re honest in that sick sort of way</text>
  <text start="1350.37" dur="4.81">the FBI uncovered specific evidence</text>
  <text start="1353.29" dur="4.02">showing that paddock was anti-trump and</text>
  <text start="1355.18" dur="4.08">had an affiliation with an T file though</text>
  <text start="1357.31" dur="3.96">it was never divulged to the public and</text>
  <text start="1359.26" dur="4.41">agents did not follow such leads per</text>
  <text start="1361.27" dur="7.05">orders of their superiors Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="1363.67" dur="7.92">reported that basically immediately</text>
  <text start="1368.32" dur="5.76">afterwards he had claimed that some of</text>
  <text start="1371.59" dur="4.31">the people that were involved in</text>
  <text start="1374.08" dur="4.07">breaking into paddocks room</text>
  <text start="1375.9" dur="4.2">I gotta remember what it&amp;#39;s this the</text>
  <text start="1378.15" dur="4.11">terrorist response unit or whatever they</text>
  <text start="1380.1" dur="4.44">were I camera the name the acronym or</text>
  <text start="1382.26" dur="5.31">something but those guys some of them</text>
  <text start="1384.54" dur="4.77">had leaked Alex Jones and said that they</text>
  <text start="1387.57" dur="2.85">had found all kinds of stuff like anti</text>
  <text start="1389.31" dur="5.01">fathered literature and things like that</text>
  <text start="1390.42" dur="6.36">so I didn&amp;#39;t know what had happened of</text>
  <text start="1394.32" dur="7.25">that narrative but now even true pundit</text>
  <text start="1396.78" dur="4.79">is backing that up so there&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="1403.97" dur="4.81">when FBI brass was given evidence that</text>
  <text start="1406.77" dur="4.2">the shooting was possibly linked to anti</text>
