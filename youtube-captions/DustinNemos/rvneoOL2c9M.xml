  <text start="116.36" dur="4.23">web site they&amp;#39;ve got lots of stuff show</text>
  <text start="118.459" dur="5.19">your support for them because they show</text>
  <text start="120.59" dur="7.47">their support for us so breaking right</text>
  <text start="123.649" dur="7.321">now finally Andrew McCabe is definitely</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="6.45">being referred for a criminal charge</text>
  <text start="130.97" dur="6.78">this is huge so he had apparently tried</text>
  <text start="134.51" dur="5.729">to appeal any sort of move in that</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="6.18">direction and he had claimed that he was</text>
  <text start="140.239" dur="5.731">fired under false pretenses and so he</text>
  <text start="143.93" dur="4.38">tried to sue but of course all of that</text>
  <text start="145.97" dur="5.04">was done in vain and he was completely</text>
  <text start="148.31" dur="6.45">denied in that appeal and so now they</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="7.259">are looking to move forward in charging</text>
  <text start="154.76" dur="6.63">Andrew McCabe so this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="158.269" dur="3.631">because I think this is one of the first</text>
  <text start="161.39" dur="3.39">of many</text>
  <text start="161.9" dur="6.24">arrests that we are going to see in the</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="6.9">very near future so we have McCabe then</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="6.03">it&amp;#39;s likely we&amp;#39;re going to see Comey as</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="4.619">well he is definitely not out of the</text>
  <text start="174.17" dur="4.11">woods at this point because again we</text>
  <text start="176.299" dur="3.69">have to remember that we have people who</text>
  <text start="178.28" dur="4.289">have been working in the background for</text>
  <text start="179.989" dur="4.981">quite some time now and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="182.569" dur="4.351">working diligently to build a case</text>
  <text start="184.97" dur="3.989">against these folks and so of course</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="5.42">like I&amp;#39;d said before one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="188.959" dur="7.381">likely why for example Thome they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="192.34" dur="7.899">charge him at that point with lack of</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="7.14">candor in the FBI it&amp;#39;s because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="200.239" dur="5.28">guilty of much bigger crimes right so</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="5.28">when it comes to signing off on the FISA</text>
  <text start="205.519" dur="6">so this is a big deal now I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="4.44">coming to the end or towards the end</text>
  <text start="211.519" dur="2.55">it&amp;#39;s the twilight now of this</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="4.709">investigation</text>
  <text start="214.069" dur="5.73">so really up until this point we</text>
  <text start="217.909" dur="4.95">couldn&amp;#39;t see anything because of course</text>
  <text start="219.799" dur="5.821">they have to keep this very air tight</text>
  <text start="222.859" dur="7.621">because if they don&amp;#39;t then what happens</text>
  <text start="225.62" dur="8.519">is some or all of these crooks get away</text>
  <text start="230.48" dur="6.27">they get off on a technicality so we</text>
  <text start="234.139" dur="5.16">cannot have that happen and a lot of</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="6.239">times if you know you&amp;#39;re leaking out</text>
  <text start="239.299" dur="5.31">information or if you are being more</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="4.021">public than you should be when it comes</text>
  <text start="244.609" dur="4.981">to these criminal investigations a lot</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="5.789">of times that&amp;#39;s what really fudges these</text>
  <text start="249.59" dur="7.35">things up so now we&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="252.799" dur="6.87">seeing charges being brought against</text>
  <text start="256.94" dur="5.759">those who are guilty anyone who was</text>
  <text start="259.669" dur="5.581">involved in this Russia hoax in this</text>
  <text start="262.699" dur="5.581">attempted coup they will not get away</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="5.909">with this and not only that but in the</text>
  <text start="268.28" dur="5.58">case of Andrew McCabe aside from the</text>
  <text start="271.159" dur="4.681">fact that he was participating in this</text>
  <text start="273.86" dur="4.17">whole scandal against President Trump</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="6.319">but also in his handling of the Hillary</text>
  <text start="278.03" dur="6.75">emails that and itself is a crime and so</text>
  <text start="282.159" dur="5.201">this is the issue that he&amp;#39;s being faced</text>
  <text start="284.78" dur="4.41">with specifically is the handling of</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="3.929">that case and then of course the leaking</text>
  <text start="289.19" dur="5.55">out of that information the mishandling</text>
  <text start="291.289" dur="4.021">of that information and so all of this</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="3.62">now</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="7.5">is going to come back and haunt him so</text>
  <text start="298.36" dur="7.27">his quote unquote employment at CNN will</text>
  <text start="302.81" dur="6.66">be quite short-lived because he will not</text>
  <text start="305.63" dur="7.83">be a free man for much longer and it</text>
  <text start="309.47" dur="5.52">should be noted that there are a few</text>
  <text start="313.46" dur="5.22">different things going on right now we</text>
  <text start="314.99" dur="6">have the work that Durham is doing as</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="4.62">well as Hoover who bur his job is really</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="5.28">to focus on the Clinton Foundation and</text>
  <text start="323.3" dur="5.22">any crimes that were committed within</text>
  <text start="326.27" dur="4.35">the Clinton Foundation of course that</text>
  <text start="328.52" dur="4.23">has to do with crimes against children</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="3.03">and anything else that falls under that</text>
  <text start="332.75" dur="2.61">category</text>
  <text start="333.65" dur="3.51">so who burr is working on that we also</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="4.68">have Durham and Durham is working</text>
  <text start="337.16" dur="5.91">diligently on the origins of the whole</text>
  <text start="340.04" dur="5.37">FISA scandal the whole Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="343.07" dur="6.12">hoax investigation so we have that going</text>
  <text start="345.41" dur="6.39">on and so these are all things that are</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="5.28">happening behind the scenes and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="5.61">how it should be done properly so as to</text>
  <text start="354.47" dur="6.3">not taint these investigations because</text>
  <text start="357.41" dur="6.18">we want to see these people pay we want</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="6.57">to see them behind bars for a long time</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="6.84">if not forever especially people like</text>
  <text start="367.34" dur="5.73">Hillary Clinton and even Obama and there</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="7.16">is no way in a proper justice system</text>
  <text start="373.07" dur="9.54">that Obama or Hillary are too big to</text>
  <text start="377.59" dur="11.4">fall that cannot be the case in a proper</text>
  <text start="382.61" dur="8.4">justice system so in order to truly</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="5.11">re-establish faith in the justice system</text>
  <text start="391.01" dur="5.37">we need to see those people even those</text>
  <text start="394.1" dur="4.26">who are the most prominent everyone from</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="3.44">the lower level players in this up to</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="5.37">the very top</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="8.32">everyone who was guilty they need to</text>
  <text start="403.73" dur="10.41">serve their time they must be held</text>
  <text start="408.14" dur="8.34">accountable this is so important very</text>
  <text start="414.14" dur="7.64">important that every single person is</text>
  <text start="416.48" dur="8.73">held accountable that is the only way to</text>
  <text start="421.78" dur="6.289">truly restore full faith in the justice</text>
  <text start="425.21" dur="5.799">system right now</text>
  <text start="428.069" dur="4.981">also at the same time we have Flynn his</text>
  <text start="431.009" dur="5.641">new lawyer is now on the offensive</text>
  <text start="433.05" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re demanding all of the documents</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="5.4">all of the pieces of evidence that are</text>
  <text start="438.3" dur="8.269">considered exculpatory evidence anything</text>
  <text start="442.05" dur="7.829">that demonstrates that he was really</text>
  <text start="446.569" dur="7.53">more or less coerced so he was coerced</text>
  <text start="449.879" dur="6.06">into this plea bargain so he pled guilty</text>
  <text start="454.099" dur="4.181">now here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="455.939" dur="4.59">so the claim here is that and of course</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="4.919">we know this to be true Flynn is</text>
  <text start="460.529" dur="4.86">innocent so people would say why would</text>
  <text start="463.199" dur="3.81">why would he plead guilty and of course</text>
  <text start="465.389" dur="4.02">we talked about this yesterday I</text>
  <text start="467.009" dur="4.741">mentioned it is that these days is not</text>
  <text start="469.409" dur="4.861">innocent until proven guilty it&amp;#39;s guilty</text>
  <text start="471.75" dur="4.71">until you&amp;#39;re proven innocent right</text>
  <text start="474.27" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s how it works now for some reason</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="4.889">it&amp;#39;s not supposed to but it does and so</text>
  <text start="478.8" dur="5.85">a lot of times if you&amp;#39;re caught in a</text>
  <text start="481.349" dur="5.97">situation where it looks like no matter</text>
  <text start="484.65" dur="7.829">what you do they are still going to be</text>
  <text start="487.319" dur="7.77">able to pin this charge on you then you</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="5.641">will likely do what it takes in order to</text>
  <text start="495.089" dur="6.661">at least lessen the sentence even if you</text>
  <text start="498.12" dur="6.389">were innocent of that because nowadays</text>
  <text start="501.75" dur="5.069">it&amp;#39;s guilty until proven innocent but</text>
  <text start="504.509" dur="5.31">now there&amp;#39;s all these pieces of evidence</text>
  <text start="506.819" dur="6.181">everything that is being discovered now</text>
  <text start="509.819" dur="5.64">as a result of the investigations that</text>
  <text start="513" dur="4.229">are currently ongoing and have been</text>
  <text start="515.459" dur="4.981">going on for the past couple of years</text>
  <text start="517.229" dur="4.86">right so as a part of that all of this</text>
  <text start="520.44" dur="5.67">information is being discovered and so</text>
  <text start="522.089" dur="8.551">now Flynn is saying okay we have this</text>
  <text start="526.11" dur="6.479">information that really all but</text>
  <text start="530.64" dur="3.48">exonerates me because of course there is</text>
  <text start="532.589" dur="3.151">no such thing or at least there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="534.12" dur="3.719">supposed to be in a proper justice</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="3.9">system there&amp;#39;s no such thing as being</text>
  <text start="537.839" dur="4.74">exonerated because of course you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.64" dur="5.79">supposed to be considered innocent until</text>
  <text start="542.579" dur="5.581">proven guilty and that guilt is supposed</text>
  <text start="545.43" dur="5.219">to be demonstrated with beyond a</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="6.239">reasonable doubt and so these are pieces</text>
  <text start="550.649" dur="6.601">of evidence that likely reach well</text>
  <text start="554.399" dur="4.861">beyond a reasonable amount of doubt it</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="4.36">it presents a huge amount of doubt</text>
  <text start="559.26" dur="6.07">regarding his guilt</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="5.82">so this is huge so now they&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="565.33" dur="6.3">for all of those documents and they want</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="9.03">all of it to be released so I believe</text>
  <text start="571.63" dur="6.51">they have until September 26 to produce</text>
  <text start="576.46" dur="3.93">all of this information so I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="578.14" dur="4.83">following up on that to see what happens</text>
  <text start="580.39" dur="3.99">in that case but at this point there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="582.97" dur="5.58">no reason why they should be withholding</text>
  <text start="584.38" dur="6.42">it because supposedly by law if they</text>
  <text start="588.55" dur="6.42">have exculpatory evidence they have to</text>
  <text start="590.8" dur="7.98">produce it okay in other news related to</text>
  <text start="594.97" dur="6.03">this of course Hillary Clinton she just</text>
  <text start="598.78" dur="5.52">will not quit she continues to try to</text>
  <text start="601" dur="6.09">push this idea that there is nothing of</text>
  <text start="604.3" dur="5.9">interest in her emails at all and that</text>
  <text start="607.09" dur="5.16">the whole thing is just it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="610.2" dur="4">insignificant and she likes to make</text>
  <text start="612.25" dur="4.32">light of it she joked about it during</text>
  <text start="614.2" dur="2.82">her campaign but this is serious</text>
  <text start="616.57" dur="2.25">business</text>
  <text start="617.02" dur="3.54">and the reason why this is serious</text>
  <text start="618.82" dur="4.44">business is because those emails not</text>
  <text start="620.56" dur="6.36">only is it serious because she had</text>
  <text start="623.26" dur="6.18">broken protocol and preserving the</text>
  <text start="626.92" dur="4.89">security of whatever information was in</text>
  <text start="629.44" dur="5.4">those emails but also the simple fact</text>
  <text start="631.81" dur="5.55">that there was evidence of crimes that</text>
  <text start="634.84" dur="6.18">she committed and the administration had</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="7.05">committed when she was in office and so</text>
  <text start="641.02" dur="6.9">apparently an artist had put her desk</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="7.47">quote-unquote on display at a gallery</text>
  <text start="647.92" dur="7.26">show and at this desk that was supposed</text>
  <text start="651.88" dur="5.85">to simulate her office space there was</text>
  <text start="655.18" dur="5.13">also a printout of about sixty-two</text>
  <text start="657.73" dur="6.09">thousand pages of what was supposed to</text>
  <text start="660.31" dur="5.97">be Hillary&amp;#39;s emails and so those who</text>
  <text start="663.82" dur="4.71">went to go view the gallery could thumb</text>
  <text start="666.28" dur="5.7">through these sheets of paper and look</text>
  <text start="668.53" dur="6.27">at her quote emails these are not her</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="6.39">real emails I seriously doubt that these</text>
  <text start="674.8" dur="6.33">are the emails but no way there is no</text>
  <text start="678.37" dur="5.13">possible way but they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="681.13" dur="4.44">present a certain image they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="683.5" dur="4.71">to make light of the situation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.57" dur="4.28">trying to turn something that is a very</text>
  <text start="688.21" dur="3.12">serious matter into</text>
  <text start="689.85" dur="6.05">[Music]</text>
  <text start="691.33" dur="7.65">basically coffee table conversation as</text>
  <text start="695.9" dur="3.08">if it&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="699.7" dur="6.25">so of course Hillary spent an hour there</text>
  <text start="702.68" dur="6.09">thumbing through these pages talking</text>
  <text start="705.95" dur="6.75">about how boring they were because again</text>
  <text start="708.77" dur="8.4">it&amp;#39;s all about the image what is the</text>
  <text start="712.7" dur="7.35">narrative that they want to push the</text>
  <text start="717.17" dur="6.68">fact that there is nothing at all to see</text>
  <text start="720.05" dur="8.55">here nothing to see here just move on</text>
  <text start="723.85" dur="11.17">sorry Hillary Clinton those of us who</text>
  <text start="728.6" dur="8.46">are aware of your true nature and aware</text>
  <text start="735.02" dur="8.48">of the crimes that you have been</text>
  <text start="737.06" dur="6.44">involved in we see right through this</text>
  <text start="746.11" dur="11.22">your emails are very serious because</text>
  <text start="751.52" dur="5.81">they contain evidence of serious crimes</text>
  <text start="758.5" dur="9.16">otherwise known as treason for example</text>
  <text start="763.73" dur="6.21">Benghazi and I likely will never stop</text>
  <text start="767.66" dur="6">talking about that until you are behind</text>
  <text start="769.94" dur="9.08">bars suffering for that crime for the</text>
  <text start="773.66" dur="8.07">loss of those individuals you and Obama</text>
  <text start="779.02" dur="10.84">I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll look very great in</text>
  <text start="781.73" dur="11.19">orange okay so moving on next thing I</text>
  <text start="789.86" dur="7.349">want to talk about is so yesterday of</text>
  <text start="792.92" dur="6.18">course was 9/11 a day of remembrance and</text>
  <text start="797.209" dur="6.331">really quickly here I just want to</text>
  <text start="799.1" dur="9.45">mention the fact that yesterday I had</text>
  <text start="803.54" dur="7.89">briefly touched on 9/11 and I had showed</text>
  <text start="808.55" dur="5.9">a little tribute clip that I had made</text>
  <text start="811.43" dur="6.75">where I tried to honor those who had</text>
  <text start="814.45" dur="7.389">lost their lives at that event first</text>
  <text start="818.18" dur="6.84">responders individuals who were in the</text>
  <text start="821.839" dur="5.971">tower and their families I tried to</text>
  <text start="825.02" dur="7.14">honor those people not necessarily talk</text>
  <text start="827.81" dur="6.029">about who was at fault and of course I</text>
  <text start="832.16" dur="4.83">know that some people had chimed in and</text>
  <text start="833.839" dur="6.301">they said they you know had mentioned</text>
  <text start="836.99" dur="5.7">the fact that I didn&amp;#39;t talk about who</text>
  <text start="840.14" dur="4.53">really caused this and all that my</text>
  <text start="842.69" dur="4.41">opinion and I had mentioned that I</text>
  <text start="844.67" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t necessarily want to talk about my</text>
  <text start="847.1" dur="4.25">opinion on what happened because I</text>
  <text start="848.9" dur="5.61">didn&amp;#39;t feel at least in my opinion</text>
  <text start="851.35" dur="7.57">personally I didn&amp;#39;t feel it was the</text>
  <text start="854.51" dur="7.29">right time to talk about that because</text>
  <text start="858.92" dur="4.62">what I wanted to do was to remember the</text>
  <text start="861.8" dur="8.72">folks that had lost their lives those</text>
  <text start="863.54" dur="12.33">people now do I have an opinion about</text>
  <text start="870.52" dur="10.03">9/11 and who caused that whole tragedy</text>
  <text start="875.87" dur="11.03">yes I do do I think it was Osama bin</text>
  <text start="880.55" dur="12.05">Laden only and that he was entirely the</text>
  <text start="886.9" dur="10.36">person behind all of that absolutely not</text>
  <text start="892.6" dur="8.229">no way and there are people who still</text>
  <text start="897.26" dur="6.18">continue to believe that it was solely</text>
  <text start="900.829" dur="5.641">on the part of the terrorists that had</text>
  <text start="903.44" dur="6.21">committed this crime and that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="906.47" dur="5.88">understand that yes</text>
  <text start="909.65" dur="10.08">there were terrorists who were involved</text>
  <text start="912.35" dur="12.9">in this tragedy but also people within</text>
  <text start="919.73" dur="15.18">our own government had also had a hand</text>
  <text start="925.25" dur="13.77">in that no doubt now the official</text>
  <text start="934.91" dur="6.75">narrative there&amp;#39;s no way that anyone who</text>
  <text start="939.02" dur="4.41">really sits and contemplates what had</text>
  <text start="941.66" dur="4.38">happened on that day there&amp;#39;s no way you</text>
  <text start="943.43" dur="5.96">could really truly believe</text>
  <text start="946.04" dur="7.74">the narrative the official narrative</text>
  <text start="949.39" dur="10.62">because in the official narrative it was</text>
  <text start="953.78" dur="6.23">the planes that knock down the towers</text>
  <text start="961.09" dur="4.39">but there have been so many pieces of</text>
  <text start="963.89" dur="4.71">evidence that have been pushed forward</text>
  <text start="965.48" dur="5.16">about how the way that the towers came</text>
  <text start="968.6" dur="5.58">down there was no way there was</text>
  <text start="970.64" dur="6.26">absolutely no way that it was the planes</text>
  <text start="974.18" dur="2.72">that took those down</text>
  <text start="979.6" dur="11.71">it was demolition style and there was</text>
  <text start="986.51" dur="8.07">even an old video where young mr. Bush</text>
  <text start="991.31" dur="6.27">former President Bush had slipped up and</text>
  <text start="994.58" dur="9.33">he had said that there were explosions</text>
  <text start="997.58" dur="8.79">on the inside explosives on the inside</text>
  <text start="1003.91" dur="5.16">oh there were explosives on the inside</text>
  <text start="1006.37" dur="5.97">they were just hanging out down below in</text>
  <text start="1009.07" dur="11.06">the lower levels for no reason really</text>
  <text start="1012.34" dur="7.79">tell us more but also beyond that I</text>
  <text start="1021.87" dur="10.41">cannot ignore the fact that our old</text>
  <text start="1027.61" dur="12.81">friend and Patriot Bill Cooper back in</text>
  <text start="1032.28" dur="10.48">June of 2001 had said that an attack was</text>
  <text start="1040.42" dur="8.61">coming and that they were going to blame</text>
  <text start="1042.76" dur="10.38">it on Osama bin Laden and what happened</text>
  <text start="1049.03" dur="6.81">a few months later exactly what he said</text>
  <text start="1053.14" dur="7.52">was going to happen now this is the same</text>
  <text start="1055.84" dur="8.88">man who was a prior a former Navy</text>
  <text start="1060.66" dur="8.86">intelligence officer he left and became</text>
  <text start="1064.72" dur="7.44">a whistleblower because of all the</text>
  <text start="1069.52" dur="6.26">information that he had seen while he</text>
  <text start="1072.16" dur="3.62">was in that position</text>
  <text start="1078.09" dur="12.49">also he had mentioned the fact that</text>
  <text start="1083.94" dur="9.73">years prior Osama bin Laden had been a</text>
  <text start="1090.58" dur="5.07">person of interest for a long time but</text>
  <text start="1093.67" dur="3.81">only since the death of Saddam Hussein</text>
  <text start="1095.65" dur="5.31">and he had mentioned that that was the</text>
  <text start="1097.48" dur="7.65">case because they needed a new boogeyman</text>
  <text start="1100.96" dur="5.91">they always need a boogeyman which is</text>
  <text start="1105.13" dur="4.43">why the deep state wanted us to be at</text>
  <text start="1106.87" dur="5.85">war with North Korea for so long Oh</text>
  <text start="1109.56" dur="6.48">their heads were spinning when President</text>
  <text start="1112.72" dur="6.36">Trump was negotiating with Kim Jung hoon</text>
  <text start="1116.04" dur="5.2">that wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to happen they</text>
  <text start="1119.08" dur="6.75">needed Kim Jung hoon to be the bad guy</text>
  <text start="1121.24" dur="6.42">just like they want Putin to be the bad</text>
  <text start="1125.83" dur="3.63">guy oh but don&amp;#39;t look at the real bad</text>
  <text start="1127.66" dur="7.47">guy China don&amp;#39;t look over there don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1129.46" dur="7.5">look over there right so back to what I</text>
  <text start="1135.13" dur="4.08">was saying about how they had been</text>
  <text start="1136.96" dur="5.79">supposedly looking for Osama bin Laden</text>
  <text start="1139.21" dur="6.96">for several years because he was a</text>
  <text start="1142.75" dur="6.75">threat during this whole time though</text>
  <text start="1146.17" dur="5.76">they could not find him the CIA FBI know</text>
  <text start="1149.5" dur="6.57">no one can find him the CIA could not</text>
  <text start="1151.93" dur="6.78">find this man but yet not only did CNN</text>
  <text start="1156.07" dur="4.68">interview of sama bin Laden in his</text>
  <text start="1158.71" dur="4.95">little hideout how on earth did they</text>
  <text start="1160.75" dur="6.54">find that guy if he&amp;#39;s so hard to find</text>
  <text start="1163.66" dur="9.3">really how does CNN get a personal</text>
  <text start="1167.29" dur="8.01">invitation on top of CNN getting an</text>
  <text start="1172.96" dur="5.73">interview with Osama bin Laden and</text>
  <text start="1175.3" dur="5.64">actually during that interview Osama bin</text>
  <text start="1178.69" dur="5.28">Laden had stated very clearly that he</text>
  <text start="1180.94" dur="7.53">had declared jihad against the United</text>
  <text start="1183.97" dur="7.65">States but nobody followed up on it</text>
  <text start="1188.47" dur="4.71">nobody went and found him they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1191.62" dur="3.15">do their jobs with all the resources</text>
  <text start="1193.18" dur="2.34">that they&amp;#39;re to put their disposal they</text>
  <text start="1194.77" dur="5.22">couldn&amp;#39;t find him</text>
  <text start="1195.52" dur="8.85">also a year after that ABC also got an</text>
  <text start="1199.99" dur="8.73">interview with Osama bin Laden the guy</text>
  <text start="1204.37" dur="5.97">who&amp;#39;s so hard to find most wanted</text>
  <text start="1208.72" dur="4.64">terrorists but they couldn&amp;#39;t find him</text>
  <text start="1210.34" dur="3.02">yet the media could</text>
  <text start="1213.82" dur="7.27">there&amp;#39;s something very suspicious about</text>
  <text start="1216.29" dur="7.59">all of that and especially knowing what</text>
  <text start="1221.09" dur="5.07">I know now about all of the other things</text>
  <text start="1223.88" dur="4.92">that they lied about for example</text>
  <text start="1226.16" dur="6.8">iran-contra and the fact that white</text>
  <text start="1228.8" dur="4.16">water scandal was never really about</text>
  <text start="1233.26" dur="5.65">Monica Lewinsky although if you ask most</text>
  <text start="1237.14" dur="2.16">people that&amp;#39;s what they remember about</text>
  <text start="1238.91" dur="2.28">it</text>
  <text start="1239.3" dur="4.01">white water is never about Monica</text>
  <text start="1241.19" dur="6.63">Lewinsky are you kidding</text>
  <text start="1243.31" dur="9.3">never that was just used as a</text>
  <text start="1247.82" dur="4.79">distraction from their real crimes oh</text>
  <text start="1252.64" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t talk about minute don&amp;#39;t talk about</text>
  <text start="1255.98" dur="2.33">Menna</text>
  <text start="1258.46" dur="10.72">the airport where they were running</text>
  <text start="1260.57" dur="10.91">drugs in and out of mr. Bill Clinton and</text>
  <text start="1269.18" dur="7.17">that&amp;#39;s how he made a name for himself</text>
  <text start="1271.48" dur="12.45">that&amp;#39;s how he was able to follow up mr.</text>
  <text start="1276.35" dur="11.12">Bush as president he was given the honor</text>
  <text start="1283.93" dur="9.18">to be brought into the presidency</text>
  <text start="1287.47" dur="10.18">because of what he did in Menna at Menna</text>
  <text start="1293.11" dur="7.42">and that&amp;#39;s why they can&amp;#39;t stand the fact</text>
  <text start="1297.65" dur="4.65">that President Trump is the president</text>
  <text start="1300.53" dur="7.74">now because that wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to</text>
  <text start="1302.3" dur="8.34">happen for years it has never been about</text>
  <text start="1308.27" dur="5.91">who we want in office it&amp;#39;s about who</text>
  <text start="1310.64" dur="7.47">they want in office who is going to</text>
  <text start="1314.18" dur="7.95">carry on their legacy who is going to</text>
  <text start="1318.11" dur="6.45">forward the agenda and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1322.13" dur="4.44">President Trump does not fit that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1324.56" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re so desperate to get him out and</text>
  <text start="1326.57" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;m not even gonna really talk about how</text>
  <text start="1328.55" dur="4.2">they actually had a hearing today on how</text>
  <text start="1331.58" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re going to try to move forward</text>
  <text start="1332.75" dur="4.88">with impeachment because it&amp;#39;s not even</text>
  <text start="1334.76" dur="5.31">worth my time they&amp;#39;re wasting their time</text>
  <text start="1337.63" dur="4.18">but they&amp;#39;re so desperate at this point</text>
  <text start="1340.07" dur="4.49">because he does not belong there</text>
  <text start="1341.81" dur="2.75">according to them</text>
  <text start="1345.43" dur="9.04">we are at a turning point in this nation</text>
  <text start="1351.47" dur="6">right now we are at a crossroads what</text>
  <text start="1354.47" dur="5.97">happens now what happens over the next</text>
  <text start="1357.47" dur="10.74">couple of years this will set the stage</text>
  <text start="1360.44" dur="11.01">for our entire future anyone who is not</text>
  <text start="1368.21" dur="5.52">aware of the reality of 9/11 of the</text>
  <text start="1371.45" dur="4.86">reality of Benghazi of the reality of</text>

  <text start="1381.11" dur="5.25">reality of those things they are not</text>
  <text start="1383.6" dur="8.76">really aware of how dire the situation</text>
  <text start="1386.36" dur="7.89">is and of course there are the same</text>
  <text start="1392.36" dur="4.2">people who continue to believe the</text>
  <text start="1394.25" dur="6.71">narrative that trump is bad and Obama</text>
  <text start="1396.56" dur="4.4">and Clinton were the best thing on earth</text>
  <text start="1402.73" dur="6.31">they don&amp;#39;t understand sometimes I wish I</text>
  <text start="1407.36" dur="3.51">could make them understand but I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1409.04" dur="3.66">you know and of course these are the</text>
  <text start="1410.87" dur="4.83">same people who believe Planned</text>
  <text start="1412.7" dur="6.69">Parenthood is a godsend when Planned</text>
  <text start="1415.7" dur="6.81">Parenthood promotes the killing of</text>
  <text start="1419.39" dur="6.27">babies and then sells those baby parts</text>
  <text start="1422.51" dur="7.02">to line their pockets and it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1425.66" dur="6.87">talked about right now in a hearing and</text>
  <text start="1429.53" dur="4.95">of course the messed up part about that</text>
  <text start="1432.53" dur="3.09">excuse me for my voice it&amp;#39;s been kind of</text>
  <text start="1434.48" dur="4.19">going in and out the last couple days</text>
  <text start="1435.62" dur="6.84">but anyway back to what I was saying in</text>
  <text start="1438.67" dur="6.13">the case involving Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1442.46" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s not against Planned Parenthood it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1444.8" dur="4.71">against the journalists that exposed</text>
  <text start="1446.72" dur="4.68">them and they are right now revealing</text>
  <text start="1449.51" dur="6">all of the details of how they were</text>
  <text start="1451.4" dur="5.46">selling baby parts for profit even</text>
  <text start="1455.51" dur="4.8">though it&amp;#39;s supposed to be against the</text>
  <text start="1456.86" dur="6.36">law and everyone on the Left is silent</text>
  <text start="1460.31" dur="5.39">about that they want to continue people</text>
  <text start="1463.22" dur="7.56">to believe that Planned Parenthood is</text>
  <text start="1465.7" dur="7.81">beneficial to people they&amp;#39;re crying a</text>
  <text start="1470.78" dur="4.98">river right now on all over media I</text>
  <text start="1473.51" dur="4.32">could show you a slew of articles</text>
  <text start="1475.76" dur="4.08">talking about House</text>
  <text start="1477.83" dur="3.81">is that clinics have to shut down</text>
  <text start="1479.84" dur="7.079">because they don&amp;#39;t get title 10 funding</text>
  <text start="1481.64" dur="6.87">anymore they chose not to receive title</text>
  <text start="1486.919" dur="4.081">10 funding because they want to continue</text>
  <text start="1488.51" dur="7.049">abortions why because then they can make</text>
  <text start="1491" dur="11.88">money off of selling the baby parts this</text>
  <text start="1495.559" dur="14.011">is reality welcome to the matrix this is</text>
  <text start="1502.88" dur="9.57">the real matrix so anyway I&amp;#39;m sorry for</text>
  <text start="1509.57" dur="5.459">not talking more about you know the</text>
  <text start="1512.45" dur="6">reality of 911 yesterday but really I I</text>
  <text start="1515.029" dur="5.071">wanted to set that aside just for a</text>
  <text start="1518.45" dur="6.319">moment just so I could honor those</text>
  <text start="1520.1" dur="4.669">people who had died and that is all</text>
  <text start="1525.85" dur="4.14">because I felt that that was necessary</text>
  <text start="1532.63" dur="7.36">so but anyway besides that also talking</text>
  <text start="1537.38" dur="5.34">about 911 another thing that I saw</text>
  <text start="1539.99" dur="4.5">yesterday that sort of infuriated me was</text>
  <text start="1542.72" dur="3.48">the fact that okay so this article here</text>
  <text start="1544.49" dur="3.929">it talks about how the New York Times</text>
  <text start="1546.2" dur="4.109">says the airplanes took aim at World</text>
  <text start="1548.419" dur="5.671">Trade Center on 9/11 and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1550.309" dur="5.821">about how instead of saying terrorists</text>
  <text start="1554.09" dur="4.589">took aim at World Trade Center they say</text>
  <text start="1556.13" dur="4.769">that the airplanes right but what</text>
  <text start="1558.679" dur="5.641">they&amp;#39;re not mentioning here is the fact</text>
  <text start="1560.899" dur="5.91">that the New York Times that story was</text>
  <text start="1564.32" dur="4.77">on the inside of New York Times not even</text>
  <text start="1566.809" dur="4.401">on the front page when I went in there</text>
  <text start="1569.09" dur="4.86">was a whole bunch of different</text>

  <text start="1937.94" dur="7.19">would have had to been denied that but</text>
  <text start="1939.8" dur="11.01">now this third country rule says that</text>
  <text start="1945.13" dur="8.17">they cannot claim asylum here so only</text>
  <text start="1950.81" dur="5.25">Mexicans should be seeking asylum here</text>

  <text start="1966.17" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to vet beyond that as</text>
  <text start="1967.88" dur="3.21">well to see if that person who&amp;#39;s seeking</text>

  <text start="1973.31" dur="5.96">regardless there&amp;#39;s been this fight right</text>
  <text start="1975.53" dur="6.15">now where they&amp;#39;re trying to really just</text>
  <text start="1979.27" dur="8.23">overturn this and they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="1981.68" dur="9.51">that it&amp;#39;s illegal for him to be imposing</text>
  <text start="1987.5" dur="6.32">this kind of rule but really I think</text>
  <text start="1991.19" dur="6.59">this is one of the more common-sense</text>
  <text start="1993.82" dur="7.45">laws when it comes to immigration reform</text>
  <text start="1997.78" dur="6.37">because it will really cut down on the</text>
  <text start="2001.27" dur="6.33">amount of people who can try to get into</text>
  <text start="2004.15" dur="6.63">this country so while that fight</text>
  <text start="2007.6" dur="6.06">continues while they battle it out in</text>
  <text start="2010.78" dur="5.7">court the Supreme Court has said that</text>
  <text start="2013.66" dur="5.76">Trump can just go ahead and bar these</text>
  <text start="2016.48" dur="6.75">people from seeking asylum that is a</text>
  <text start="2019.42" dur="6.03">very good thing okay and of course the</text>
  <text start="2023.23" dur="5.75">border wall continues its progress</text>
  <text start="2025.45" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s very good so this was one of his</text>
  <text start="2028.98" dur="5.74">promises to the American people that he</text>
  <text start="2031.39" dur="6.84">would build a border wall and of course</text>
  <text start="2034.72" dur="7.92">a lot of the money that is funding this</text>
  <text start="2038.23" dur="7.56">is coming from the Pentagon money and of</text>
  <text start="2042.64" dur="6">course that was part of actually a drug</text>
  <text start="2045.79" dur="6.15">program so which is very fitting</text>
  <text start="2048.64" dur="5.04">actually especially since the border one</text>
  <text start="2051.94" dur="4.8">of the problems with the border is that</text>
  <text start="2053.68" dur="4.77">it is a major highway for drug</text>
  <text start="2056.74" dur="3.99">trafficking all kinds of trafficking</text>
  <text start="2058.45" dur="4.29">happens across a porous border including</text>
  <text start="2060.73" dur="4.71">drug trafficking gun trafficking and</text>
  <text start="2062.74" dur="5.16">human trafficking so it is very fitting</text>
  <text start="2065.44" dur="8.3">that money for drug programs would be</text>
  <text start="2067.9" dur="10.71">diverted from the Pentagon to this wall</text>
  <text start="2073.74" dur="8.68">and like I said before the wall is a</text>
  <text start="2078.61" dur="6.63">mechanism of defense so military budget</text>
  <text start="2082.42" dur="5.94">should be a very appropriate sorts</text>
  <text start="2085.24" dur="6.78">scenes how the military&amp;#39;s purpose is for</text>
  <text start="2088.36" dur="6.09">defense of this country so it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="2092.02" dur="4.2">more appropriate in my opinion that</text>
  <text start="2094.45" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re spending that money right here</text>
  <text start="2096.22" dur="4.77">defending our own borders than it is</text>

  <text start="2104.94" dur="5.59">so this is a very good thing and of</text>
  <text start="2107.29" dur="5.79">course you know the border wall is only</text>
  <text start="2110.53" dur="5.67">one piece of the puzzle there does need</text>
  <text start="2113.08" dur="5.97">to be immigration reform as well as</text>

  <text start="2403.87" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="2406.45" dur="4.86">that you should definitely familiarize</text>

  <text start="2411.31" dur="3.33">familiar with it you will recognize a</text>
  <text start="2413.17" dur="3.69">lot of these things that they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="2414.64" dur="5.25">to push and why they&amp;#39;re pushing it right</text>
  <text start="2416.86" dur="5.43">now alright moving on because again no</text>
  <text start="2419.89" dur="5.82">one making this too long that&amp;#39;s that can</text>
  <text start="2422.29" dur="7.05">be a whole video by itself really is</text>
  <text start="2425.71" dur="5.7">that is such a big topic okay so of</text>
  <text start="2429.34" dur="3.9">course Democrats admit Trump helped the</text>
  <text start="2431.41" dur="4.86">GOP candidates weak North Carolina</text>
  <text start="2433.24" dur="8.19">special elections no surprise here and</text>
  <text start="2436.27" dur="8.97">of course the reason being because when</text>
  <text start="2441.43" dur="8.52">he endorsed those individuals he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2445.24" dur="8.61">saying to those voters that hey these</text>
  <text start="2449.95" dur="7.5">guys are with me they are going to be in</text>
  <text start="2453.85" dur="7.26">line with what I am trying to build in</text>
  <text start="2457.45" dur="7.35">this country and so anyone who voted for</text>
  <text start="2461.11" dur="5.01">Trump is going to look at this person</text>
  <text start="2464.8" dur="3.15">who&amp;#39;s being endorsed by Trump and</text>
  <text start="2466.12" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re gonna say you know what I bet I</text>
  <text start="2467.95" dur="4.5">should vote for this person because of</text>
  <text start="2469.93" dur="5.67">course we want a government that works</text>
  <text start="2472.45" dur="4.71">together not a government that is</text>
  <text start="2475.6" dur="3.45">comprised of people who are constantly</text>
  <text start="2477.16" dur="6.93">trying to oppose the president who we</text>
  <text start="2479.05" dur="7.02">voted in so this is no surprise here and</text>
  <text start="2484.09" dur="5.01">this should be a message to the to the</text>
  <text start="2486.07" dur="5.34">Democrats that President Trump will</text>
  <text start="2489.1" dur="7.98">likely be re-elected again in 2020</text>
  <text start="2491.41" dur="6.96">there&amp;#39;s no doubt although they would</text>
  <text start="2497.08" dur="3.63">like us to believe that</text>
  <text start="2498.37" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s not really the case I read an</text>
  <text start="2500.71" dur="6.18">op-ed earlier today where the author was</text>
  <text start="2504.13" dur="6.69">talking about how president Trump&amp;#39;s shot</text>
  <text start="2506.89" dur="5.82">of being reelected is quite dim and that</text>
  <text start="2510.82" dur="4.47">his approval rating is very low right</text>
  <text start="2512.71" dur="4.59">now according to some Gallup poll but of</text>
  <text start="2515.29" dur="4.83">course we know that these polls aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2517.3" dur="6.72">really reliable especially since the day</text>
  <text start="2520.12" dur="8.07">before the election they claimed that</text>
  <text start="2524.02" dur="7.92">Hillary Clinton had 99.9 percent of the</text>
  <text start="2528.19" dur="4.83">votes and that President Trump didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2531.94" dur="5.19">have a shot in the dark</text>
  <text start="2533.02" dur="7.11">seriously everybody was just shocked</text>
  <text start="2537.13" dur="5.28">when he won oh but the polls they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2540.13" dur="5.52">mean anything these are just numbers</text>
  <text start="2542.41" dur="9.66">they throw out just to get you to think</text>
  <text start="2545.65" dur="12.72">a certain way right because a person who</text>
  <text start="2552.07" dur="9.9">has this idea that their vote won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2558.37" dur="5.49">count because the chances are so slim</text>
  <text start="2561.97" dur="4.83">then they probably won&amp;#39;t even go out and</text>
  <text start="2563.86" dur="6.66">vote they won&amp;#39;t bother they&amp;#39;ll say why</text>
  <text start="2566.8" dur="6.78">bother but we should know by now that</text>
  <text start="2570.52" dur="4.47">the polls don&amp;#39;t mean anything okay the</text>
  <text start="2573.58" dur="3.81">last thing I want to talk about really</text>
  <text start="2574.99" dur="4.38">quickly actually no I&amp;#39;m going to talk</text>
  <text start="2577.39" dur="4.77">about one more thing after this but I</text>
  <text start="2579.37" dur="5.07">want to make this quick so somebody had</text>
  <text start="2582.16" dur="5.27">asked about Interpol and why Interpol</text>
  <text start="2584.44" dur="8.07">wasn&amp;#39;t intervening in all of these cases</text>
  <text start="2587.43" dur="8.41">where there is the possibility of a link</text>
  <text start="2592.51" dur="7.02">with China as far as human trafficking</text>
  <text start="2595.84" dur="5.58">so we have multi-state trafficking human</text>
  <text start="2599.53" dur="3.6">trafficking networks here in the country</text>
  <text start="2601.42" dur="5.37">and of course has been linked to China</text>
  <text start="2603.13" dur="7.53">so it was asked why wasn&amp;#39;t Interpol</text>
  <text start="2606.79" dur="7.11">involved well first of all I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="2610.66" dur="5.88">I would trust Interpol really especially</text>
  <text start="2613.9" dur="5.31">since they&amp;#39;re affiliated with United</text>
  <text start="2616.54" dur="4.29">Nations and I don&amp;#39;t trust the United</text>
  <text start="2619.21" dur="5.79">Nations as far as I can through them and</text>
  <text start="2620.83" dur="7.59">that is definitely not far at all they</text>
  <text start="2625" dur="5.509">are behind a lot of these crimes against</text>
  <text start="2628.42" dur="5.369">humans</text>
  <text start="2630.509" dur="8.29">these human rights abuses right there</text>
  <text start="2633.789" dur="7.861">behind a lot of that so why wouldn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="2638.799" dur="5.671">expect them to act on any of these</text>
  <text start="2641.65" dur="5.01">crimes but sometimes they want to make</text>
  <text start="2644.47" dur="5.069">it appear that they&amp;#39;re addressing these</text>
  <text start="2646.66" dur="4.619">issues right so now the interpol</text>
  <text start="2649.539" dur="3.57">director has come out and they have said</text>
  <text start="2651.279" dur="3.961">that you must follow the money to fight</text>
  <text start="2653.109" dur="6.531">human trafficking that is a piece of</text>
  <text start="2655.24" dur="7.289">truth if they follow the money trail</text>
  <text start="2659.64" dur="5.199">they will be able to find the</text>
  <text start="2662.529" dur="5.371">connections within this international</text>
  <text start="2664.839" dur="5.22">human trafficking network and they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="2667.9" dur="9.05">able to close in on those who are</text>
  <text start="2670.059" dur="11.911">responsible however talk is cheap so</text>
  <text start="2676.95" dur="8.369">they can say that if you follow the</text>
  <text start="2681.97" dur="5.76">money you can fight human trafficking</text>
  <text start="2685.319" dur="5.95">but what are they doing they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2687.73" dur="6.509">doing anything they&amp;#39;re making it appear</text>
  <text start="2691.269" dur="8.701">like they&amp;#39;re doing something just like</text>
  <text start="2694.239" dur="11.971">the United Nations guilty of the same</text>
  <text start="2699.97" dur="11.91">human rights crimes that they scream at</text>
  <text start="2706.21" dur="9.629">everyone else about so I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="2711.88" dur="6.54">trust the Interpol and I although I</text>
  <text start="2715.839" dur="5.52">think what he&amp;#39;s saying is true it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2718.42" dur="5.089">talk at this point I&amp;#39;ll believe it when</text>
  <text start="2721.359" dur="5.01">I see it</text>
  <text start="2723.509" dur="6.07">okay finally the last thing I want to</text>
  <text start="2726.369" dur="5.041">talk about are these two clinics that</text>
  <text start="2729.579" dur="4.53">are closing down in Ohio and of course</text>
  <text start="2731.41" dur="4.889">like I said earlier of course it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2734.109" dur="5.73">over the media they&amp;#39;re crying rivers</text>
  <text start="2736.299" dur="6.8">about this because of course it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="2739.839" dur="6.48">know preventing them from providing very</text>
  <text start="2743.099" dur="5.801">necessary services to low-income women</text>
  <text start="2746.319" dur="9.03">who need them very badly but here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2748.9" dur="9.389">thing all they had to do with separate</text>
  <text start="2755.349" dur="4.41">their abortion practices from those very</text>
  <text start="2758.289" dur="3.77">necessary services but they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2759.759" dur="4.531">to do that</text>
  <text start="2762.059" dur="4.361">now of course these clinics that they</text>
  <text start="2764.29" dur="6.6">closed down are the ones that provide</text>
  <text start="2766.42" dur="6.96">those very necessary other services such</text>
  <text start="2770.89" dur="8.01">as screenings and reproductive health</text>
  <text start="2773.38" dur="7.77">and preventive health care but those two</text>
  <text start="2778.9" dur="5.28">clinics actually or they say they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2781.15" dur="6.03">they don&amp;#39;t provide abortion so they let</text>
  <text start="2784.18" dur="6.3">these clinics close down yet it&amp;#39;s likely</text>
  <text start="2787.18" dur="5.73">that they didn&amp;#39;t let their other clinics</text>
  <text start="2790.48" dur="4.079">close down the ones that do provide the</text>
  <text start="2792.91" dur="4.409">abortions because that is their real</text>
  <text start="2794.559" dur="7.851">purpose their real purpose is to</text>
  <text start="2797.319" dur="7.351">continue to provide abortions in</text>
  <text start="2802.41" dur="5.5">reproductive health services family</text>
  <text start="2804.67" dur="7.439">planning services that is really just a</text>
  <text start="2807.91" dur="7.5">cover so they can appear benevolent so</text>
  <text start="2812.109" dur="10.561">they can appear to the public as a</text>
  <text start="2815.41" dur="10.47">necessary organization all right also</text>
  <text start="2822.67" dur="5.399">related to that so we have the former a</text>
  <text start="2825.88" dur="4.32">former medical director from Planned</text>
  <text start="2828.069" dur="5.161">Parenthood is backing the born alive</text>
  <text start="2830.2" dur="5.159">bill and she made a statement she says</text>
  <text start="2833.23" dur="4.05">that Democrats think that this bill is</text>
  <text start="2835.359" dur="5.551">just one more encroachment on abortion</text>
  <text start="2837.28" dur="5.73">and it&amp;#39;s absolutely not so she is saying</text>
  <text start="2840.91" dur="5.189">that there&amp;#39;s no reason why Democrats</text>
  <text start="2843.01" dur="5.43">should not support the born alive bill</text>
  <text start="2846.099" dur="4.26">and that has nothing to do with the</text>
  <text start="2848.44" dur="4.679">abortion itself it has everything to do</text>
  <text start="2850.359" dur="6.99">with preserving the life of a child</text>
  <text start="2853.119" dur="6.871">and so she&amp;#39;s absolutely right because</text>
  <text start="2857.349" dur="6.24">after a failed abortion and the baby is</text>
  <text start="2859.99" dur="5.099">alive still that baby is not about the</text>
  <text start="2863.589" dur="4.651">abortion at that point because the</text>
  <text start="2865.089" dur="5.191">process has already happened it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="2868.24" dur="6.589">the preservation of that light that life</text>
  <text start="2870.28" dur="9.99">the right for that child to now live and</text>
  <text start="2874.829" dur="7.301">of course opponents to this say that it</text>
  <text start="2880.27" dur="8.4">encroaches on the woman&amp;#39;s right to</text>
  <text start="2882.13" dur="9.59">choose what authority does she have to</text>
  <text start="2888.67" dur="3.05">decide who lives and dies</text>
  <text start="2894.52" dur="7.68">like I don&amp;#39;t will myself pregnant so</text>
  <text start="2898.36" dur="9.45">that I can have a baby I don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="2902.2" dur="8.16">right to decide that a person gets</text>
  <text start="2907.81" dur="10.62">delivered I because that is a person</text>
  <text start="2910.36" dur="10.41">inside the womb is a person that that</text>
  <text start="2918.43" dur="6.17">woman who is pregnant with that baby she</text>
  <text start="2920.77" dur="3.83">did not will that baby to be there</text>
  <text start="2924.78" dur="5.14">it did not come about because she had</text>
  <text start="2927.67" dur="4.11">the authority to give it life so she</text>
  <text start="2929.92" dur="2.31">does not have the authority to give it</text>
  <text start="2931.78" dur="2.7">life</text>
  <text start="2932.23" dur="11.78">then what gives her the authority to</text>
  <text start="2934.48" dur="14.07">decide if it dies that&amp;#39;s my argument if</text>
  <text start="2944.01" dur="8.08">you get pregnant you do not have the</text>
  <text start="2948.55" dur="9">authority to decide that that child</text>
  <text start="2952.09" dur="7.65">cannot live if you decide you are too</text>
  <text start="2957.55" dur="4.22">irresponsible or not ready or not</text>
  <text start="2959.74" dur="6.33">prepared or whatever the case may be</text>
  <text start="2961.77" dur="6.28">there are other options or you can put</text>
  <text start="2966.07" dur="5.61">on your big-girl pants and take care of</text>
  <text start="2968.05" dur="6.33">that baby you do not have the right to</text>
  <text start="2971.68" dur="4.89">decide that that baby can&amp;#39;t live if you</text>
  <text start="2974.38" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t have the authority to give it life</text>
  <text start="2976.57" dur="6.9">then you don&amp;#39;t have the authority to</text>
  <text start="2978.07" dur="10.05">give it death there is no reason why</text>
  <text start="2983.47" dur="7.2">this bill cannot be brought to a vote it</text>
  <text start="2988.12" dur="8.04">they need to at least bring it to a vote</text>
  <text start="2990.67" dur="8.64">a baby that survives an abortion should</text>
  <text start="2996.16" dur="4.89">be allowed the opportunity to live all</text>
  <text start="2999.31" dur="3.45">right that&amp;#39;s all I have for today thank</text>
