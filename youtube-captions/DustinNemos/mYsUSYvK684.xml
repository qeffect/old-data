  <text start="51.84" dur="5.16">that area today right after a short word</text>
  <text start="54.09" dur="5.43">from our Patriot sponsors there was a</text>
  <text start="57" dur="4.59">time when I had my head in the sand then</text>
  <text start="59.52" dur="4.76">I found out that power players passed</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="5.489">lies for truth and truth for lies</text>
  <text start="64.28" dur="5.829">especially in areas of life and hell I</text>
  <text start="67.079" dur="5.881">used to stay quiet and now I speak up a</text>

  <text start="86.31" dur="6.409">living calm wake up stand up speak up</text>
  <text start="96.58" dur="5.44">now before we start in the news I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="99.17" dur="5.73">to add how does President Trump do this</text>
  <text start="102.02" dur="4.83">he is an old guy and I miss young guy I</text>
  <text start="104.9" dur="4.65">can barely keep up with him I can barely</text>
  <text start="106.85" dur="4.38">report on all of the things happening</text>
  <text start="109.55" dur="3.93">that he&amp;#39;s actively physically flying</text>
  <text start="111.23" dur="4.14">around the country do it that&amp;#39;s how much</text>
  <text start="113.48" dur="3.87">energy this man has I&amp;#39;m just I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="115.37" dur="4.17">little impressed as all you know I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="117.35" dur="3.72">kind of a fanboy for this president I</text>
  <text start="119.54" dur="3.84">know that many of you are thorough as</text>
  <text start="121.07" dur="4.95">well so I won&amp;#39;t feel too bad kind of</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="5.7">talking about a little bit but anyway so</text>
  <text start="126.02" dur="4.02">for the first time in living memory at</text>
  <text start="129.08" dur="2.91">least I don&amp;#39;t think this has ever</text>
  <text start="130.04" dur="5.49">happened before more people are leaving</text>
  <text start="131.99" dur="5.25">California than moving in now I doubt</text>
  <text start="135.53" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re talking about the illegal</text>
  <text start="137.24" dur="2.82">immigration issue here because they</text>
  <text start="138.68" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t track those people for the most</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="3.81">part and and that makes it hard to</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="4.26">determine those numbers but other than</text>
  <text start="143.87" dur="4.41">that people are leaving California</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;ve got something called Cal exit</text>
  <text start="148.28" dur="5.09">where a lot of people are just fleeing</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="5.94">whether it&amp;#39;s the politics that the very</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="4.78">regressive you know or supposedly</text>
  <text start="155.81" dur="3.99">progressive politics that are over there</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="4.65">in California kind of Democrat</text>
  <text start="159.8" dur="4.409">controlled unfortunately territory or</text>
  <text start="162.8" dur="4.05">maybe they&amp;#39;re just fleeing the economic</text>
  <text start="164.209" dur="4.351">situations I mean either you&amp;#39;re rich or</text>
  <text start="166.85" dur="3.81">homeless right now I mean there&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="4.41">lot of middle ground if you have a home</text>
  <text start="170.66" dur="3.81">you&amp;#39;re probably slaving away just to be</text>
  <text start="172.97" dur="2.64">able to pay your rent because you</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="3.87">certainly don&amp;#39;t own it in California</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="4.17">most likely this is the situation a lot</text>
  <text start="178.34" dur="4.11">of people are leaving most of them are</text>
  <text start="179.78" dur="4.23">going to Texas there was even a movement</text>
  <text start="182.45" dur="3.06">I don&amp;#39;t remember the website name but</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="3.84">there was a group that was helping</text>
  <text start="185.51" dur="3.87">people to facilitate their transfer</text>
  <text start="187.85" dur="4.109">helping conservatives to facilitate</text>
  <text start="189.38" dur="5.82">their exit or Cal exit from California</text>
  <text start="191.959" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s a very interesting thing and while</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="3.87">I do want to see conservatives leave</text>
  <text start="197.239" dur="4.291">California and mass get their children</text>
  <text start="199.07" dur="5.1">out of there with a vaccine laws get</text>
  <text start="201.53" dur="4.29">your families out of there just protect</text>
  <text start="204.17" dur="3.93">yourselves right I hate to see people</text>
  <text start="205.82" dur="4.68">suffer I need to see good people suffer</text>
  <text start="208.1" dur="4.53">especially and I really hate to see good</text>
  <text start="210.5" dur="5.58">conservatives suffer the bullying of the</text>
  <text start="212.63" dur="4.98">left especially the children so I really</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="3.9">would like to see people leave</text>
  <text start="217.61" dur="3.84">California but I know that we have a lot</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="3.99">of Patriots in California fighting</text>
  <text start="221.45" dur="4.83">really hard to get this state back to</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="4.27">the Union so I I do want to give them a</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="3.97">prop or or a</text>
  <text start="228.24" dur="4.74">tip because you guys are doing something</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="5.22">really risky really scary really</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="4.89">dangerous really noble and I appreciate</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="3.93">you you know I know I know not everyone</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="3.23">can even afford to leave right so</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s things like that as well</text>
  <text start="241.1" dur="4.54">just you know everyone has to kind of</text>
  <text start="243.6" dur="5.67">make that decision for themselves now we</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="7.05">also have supposedly Mifsud okay Mifsud</text>
  <text start="249.27" dur="5.82">is apparently dead now I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="5.73">this but people are saying he&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="255.09" dur="6.83">certainly dead here so this is the</text>
  <text start="258.42" dur="6.09">multis professor who helped to entrap</text>
  <text start="261.92" dur="5.35">george papadapolis and and then</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="5.01">basically disappeared and if you guys</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="4.59">remember just a month ago we had a</text>
  <text start="269.52" dur="4.62">report from Italian news claiming that</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="5.45">Mifsud was kidnapped by Italian</text>
  <text start="274.14" dur="5.67">intelligence on Halloween in 2017 and</text>
  <text start="277.31" dur="5.5">whereabouts were still unknown so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.81" dur="4.83">missing presumed dead last really last</text>
  <text start="282.81" dur="3.75">information we had was the intelligence</text>
  <text start="284.64" dur="2.91">community in Israel probably kidnapped</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="3">him now</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="3.63">probably is not the strongest evidence</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="4.61">out there but remember they were</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="5.25">involved with five eyes they have a</text>
  <text start="294.17" dur="3.97">liability in what happened with</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="4.23">President Trump Russia spy gate all this</text>
  <text start="298.14" dur="5.64">stuff they helped so maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.66" dur="5.4">trying to destroy a link to Italy I</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t know but either way the deeps</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="3.42">eight would love for this guy to</text>
  <text start="307.41" dur="5.25">disappear and not come out and testify</text>
  <text start="309.48" dur="5.25">about what he knows so excuse me</text>
  <text start="312.66" dur="4.83">continuing on we also have Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="314.73" dur="5.25">police arresting four of the alleged</text>
  <text start="317.49" dur="3.99">financers of the protest movement now</text>
  <text start="319.98" dur="3.24">there but basically what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="321.48" dur="3.72">is they&amp;#39;re saying oh you guys are</text>
  <text start="323.22" dur="4.11">funding the movement we found some</text>
  <text start="325.2" dur="3.5">problems with your taxes see what</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="328.7" dur="4.33">illegally I mean this is not legitimate</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="4.62">this is to try to stop the movement by</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="4.41">going after unrelated financials because</text>
  <text start="335.64" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re trying to stop the movement so</text>
  <text start="337.44" dur="4.38">this is the kind of stuff you see happen</text>
  <text start="339.18" dur="4.38">all the time with tyrants and the best</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="4.05">example I could point to right here in</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="5.07">personal experience territory is how</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="4.5">YouTube or big tech companies will go</text>
  <text start="348.63" dur="4.02">after the funding of people like myself</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="4.71">independent media independent voices</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="4.41">that try to to go and spread the word</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="3.899">try to share the truth with people and</text>
  <text start="357.06" dur="4.48">try to you know push back some</text>
  <text start="358.979" dur="4.811">resistance against the fake news media</text>
  <text start="361.54" dur="4.59">well we get cut off we could cut off</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="4.44">from our traffic D boosting and shadow</text>
  <text start="366.13" dur="4.53">banning and algorithms we get cut off</text>
  <text start="368.23" dur="6.12">from our funding with D monetization and</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="5.91">also in a sense that the traffic being</text>
  <text start="374.35" dur="4.56">killed by algorithms is also a form of D</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="4.37">monetization because even if we even if</text>
  <text start="378.91" dur="4.92">we find our own sponsors and advertisers</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="5.2">we don&amp;#39;t get the traffic anymore whereas</text>
  <text start="383.83" dur="4.23">before we earned a lot of traffic I mean</text>
  <text start="386.14" dur="5.7">you guys remember my channel was growing</text>
  <text start="388.06" dur="6.18">1200 subscribers a day for the first 11</text>
  <text start="391.84" dur="4.62">days and then I&amp;#39;ve had months where I</text>
  <text start="394.24" dur="3.93">would gain 30,000 subscribers I mean it</text>
  <text start="396.46" dur="3.75">was a very fast growing channel and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="398.17" dur="3.99">not bragging there&amp;#39;s others that grew</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="4.8">much faster than I did</text>
  <text start="402.16" dur="5.67">not many granted but there have been and</text>
  <text start="405.01" dur="5.58">I don&amp;#39;t take credit for that necessarily</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="4.59">I think most of that I&amp;#39;d say 10% of it</text>
  <text start="410.59" dur="3.63">is just the fact that I speak well and I</text>
  <text start="412.42" dur="3.9">kind of know what I&amp;#39;m talking about 90%</text>
  <text start="414.22" dur="4.77">of it is the fact that I helped build</text>
  <text start="416.32" dur="5.1">the Q movement as fake news was dying I</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="4.5">mean they pushed people to me right they</text>
  <text start="421.42" dur="4.17">they killed their own credibility and I</text>
  <text start="423.49" dur="3.84">was there to capture it because people</text>
  <text start="425.59" dur="3.27">know that I have integrity and they know</text>
  <text start="427.33" dur="4.2">that I have a reputation for telling the</text>
  <text start="428.86" dur="4.95">truth now and for standing up so you</text>
  <text start="431.53" dur="4.56">know you can you could have at one point</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="3.84">gotten a lot of traffic for just telling</text>
  <text start="436.09" dur="3.42">the truth there was so much demand for</text>
  <text start="437.65" dur="4.11">the truth and so many lies being told</text>
  <text start="439.51" dur="4.44">but the truth is no longer enough</text>
  <text start="441.76" dur="5.16">because of the algorithm so you know we</text>
  <text start="443.95" dur="5.28">are being effectively cheated out of 99%</text>
  <text start="446.92" dur="4.17">of our traffic and then that last 1% is</text>
  <text start="449.23" dur="3.75">coming soon that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="3.45">all these changes now so that they can</text>
  <text start="452.98" dur="3.92">Bana soon under the guise of being</text>
  <text start="454.54" dur="5.04">financially unviable whatever that means</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="4.21">because where I was very financially</text>
  <text start="459.58" dur="3.75">viable for YouTube making them a lot of</text>
  <text start="461.11" dur="4.71">money before I mean I&amp;#39;ve probably made</text>
  <text start="463.33" dur="4.86">YouTube hundreds of thousands of dollars</text>
  <text start="465.82" dur="4.26">guys off of the ads played on my channel</text>
  <text start="468.19" dur="4.8">now they didn&amp;#39;t share any of that with</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="5.28">me unfortunately I I made ten thousand</text>
  <text start="472.99" dur="3.96">dollars one month the same month I made</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="4.02">thirty thousand new subscribers because</text>
  <text start="476.95" dur="4.58">I tricked the algorithm and I paid for a</text>
  <text start="479.38" dur="4.35">$5 a month Google Adsense account</text>
  <text start="481.53" dur="3.7">advertisement made them think I was a</text>
  <text start="483.73" dur="3.78">paying customer and it took me off the</text>
  <text start="485.23" dur="4.05">algorithm for a while which is a little</text>
  <text start="487.51" dur="2.88">trick I learned from another YouTube</text>
  <text start="489.28" dur="3.09">Ryan I don&amp;#39;t even think that works</text>
  <text start="490.39" dur="5.01">anymore you know feel free to to give it</text>
  <text start="492.37" dur="5.19">a shot if you&amp;#39;re a youtuber but anyway</text>
  <text start="495.4" dur="4.67">kind of digressing and ranting at this</text>
  <text start="497.56" dur="5.31">point so let&amp;#39;s move on to the next topic</text>
  <text start="500.07" dur="4.39">it&amp;#39;s hard to do this job guys it really</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="3.359">is hard to do this job when you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="504.46" dur="4.23">know your bills you don&amp;#39;t know your</text>
  <text start="506.229" dur="5.041">financial situation next month you know</text>

  <text start="512.89" dur="3.959">that&amp;#39;s a priority even for me because</text>

  <text start="516.849" dur="3.091">want to be deep state evil but I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="518.83" dur="2.91">a husband and father I still have</text>

  <text start="524.169" dur="5.011">donation to support independent media</text>
  <text start="526.69" dur="4.86">right we should have the advertisements</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="4.89">that that same kind of access that these</text>
  <text start="531.55" dur="4.11">big media companies have although they</text>
  <text start="534.07" dur="3.33">sell a bunch of pharmaceutical drugs and</text>
  <text start="535.66" dur="3.69">I would never sell that we should still</text>
  <text start="537.4" dur="4.53">have access to advertisements but we</text>
  <text start="539.35" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t so instead we have to come to you</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="5.34">that the the audience we have to rely on</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="4.8">you and II beg for money and donations</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="4.56">and support our sponsors and all this</text>

  <text start="723.73" dur="4.41">guys have been following their I hope</text>
  <text start="725.8" dur="4.68">what&amp;#39;s happening the Second Amendment is</text>
  <text start="728.14" dur="5.25">under attack like we have never seen in</text>

  <text start="737.89" dur="4.38">violate your Second Amendment rights and</text>
  <text start="739.65" dur="4.33">frankly Virginia is not having it 90</text>
  <text start="742.27" dur="4.53">plus percent of the counties have</text>
  <text start="743.98" dur="3.75">declared themselves a sanctuary city for</text>
  <text start="746.8" dur="2.7">Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="747.73" dur="4.26">now that sets it up for a very</text>
  <text start="749.5" dur="4.44">interesting kind of a precedent-setting</text>
  <text start="751.99" dur="4.41">because if the Democrats move against a</text>

  <text start="756.4" dur="4.11">move against the illegal alien sanctuary</text>
  <text start="758.11" dur="3.95">cities the same way I don&amp;#39;t know but</text>

  <text start="780.16" dur="4.739">often but they want everything to just</text>
  <text start="782.47" dur="4.559">erupt into violence I think that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="784.899" dur="3.961">the goal is here and and maybe they want</text>
  <text start="787.029" dur="4.111">to bring in the UN and try to declare</text>
  <text start="788.86" dur="4.62">Trump an illegal president I you know</text>
