  <text start="28.68" dur="3.629">gonna be a typical experience like that</text>
  <text start="30.42" dur="5.639">because you know the regulations and the</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="6.061">rules are just so SH so insane however I</text>
  <text start="36.059" dur="4.381">will I will reiterate the point that</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ve made before the big pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="40.44" dur="4.86">system is killing us please check out</text>
  <text start="42.78" dur="5.25">the recent interview I did with Roseanne</text>
  <text start="45.3" dur="4.919">Lindsey and nature of paths if you want</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="3.419">some more details into that but I just</text>
  <text start="50.219" dur="3.241">wanted to share this with you guys cuz</text>
  <text start="51.449" dur="3.511">this needed to be shared alright I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="4.349">just gonna read through here I&amp;#39;ve cut</text>
  <text start="54.96" dur="4.95">out his name for privacy but here he</text>
  <text start="57.809" dur="5.311">says alright here are a few health</text>
  <text start="59.91" dur="5.999">observations I&amp;#39;m a national level tennis</text>
  <text start="63.12" dur="4.95">player in my age in the last 15 years I</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="4.261">was only able to play with contacts for</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="4.89">movies I had to wear glasses none of</text>
  <text start="70.17" dur="4.62">this is needed anymore in addition my</text>
  <text start="72.96" dur="3.78">recovery time after tennis matches or</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="3.869">rough yoga sessions for that matter has</text>
  <text start="76.74" dur="4.769">improved so significantly it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="78.659" dur="4.53">not describable just four weeks ago I</text>
  <text start="81.509" dur="3.75">got diagnosed with Lyme disease which</text>
  <text start="83.189" dur="4.771">was just which was found two point five</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="4.531">months after the Lyme causing event that</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="3.9">is typically too late to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="89.79" dur="4.5">disease I had to take antibiotics for</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="4.35">three weeks I usually never take any</text>
  <text start="94.29" dur="4.079">antibiotics or Western medicine drugs</text>
  <text start="96.21" dur="5.13">however in this case it was the right</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="5.161">thing to do doctor told me I would feel</text>
  <text start="101.34" dur="4.76">really sick and likely throw up and deal</text>
  <text start="103.53" dur="5.909">with stomachache be extremely fatigued</text>
  <text start="106.1" dur="5.83">etc guess what I continued to play three</text>
  <text start="109.439" dur="4.411">hour-long tennis matches in 95 degrees I</text>
  <text start="111.93" dur="4.56">felt great the whole time despite the</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="4.559">heavy antibiotics and now I got rid of</text>
  <text start="116.49" dur="3.9">the Lyme disease the very obvious</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="4.231">observation is that the antibiotics did</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="5.009">their job while the c60 was preventing</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="6.66">any noticeable side effects yes I live a</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="5.7">healthy life so that helps too but and I</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="3.63">had the full reserve to push through</text>
  <text start="131.099" dur="2.901">this time nicely and be done with this</text>
  <text start="132.93" dur="5">pretty horrific</text>
  <text start="134" dur="5.94">in no time see 60 is absolutely amazing</text>
  <text start="137.93" dur="4.89">I plan to do a video on that at some</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="5.76">point we also have a friend who almost</text>
  <text start="142.82" dur="5.28">died after many years of heavy MS and</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="5.009">that and from that resulting other</text>
  <text start="148.1" dur="5.43">issues and guess where she ended up</text>
  <text start="150.709" dur="5.401">three months after taking c60 before</text>
  <text start="153.53" dur="5.4">almost dead in a wheelchair not even</text>
  <text start="156.11" dur="5.31">able to hold a cup of a coffee cup she</text>
  <text start="158.93" dur="3.99">is all up again and even treats patients</text>
  <text start="161.42" dur="6.45">again as a physical and massage</text>
  <text start="162.92" dur="7.319">therapist miracle yeah indeed I do know</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="5.369">that c60 also works on energetic levels</text>
  <text start="170.239" dur="4.891">which most of you may not relate to but</text>
  <text start="173.239" dur="4.411">it does most certainly increase the</text>
  <text start="175.13" dur="5.46">ability to sense to see and to connect</text>
  <text start="177.65" dur="4.44">with spirit I can&amp;#39;t prove that but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="3.78">been on a spiritual journey for two</text>
  <text start="182.09" dur="5.94">decades it accelerates development in</text>
  <text start="184.37" dur="6.48">that sense my friends this is such an</text>
  <text start="188.03" dur="5.1">interesting you know anecdotal personal</text>
  <text start="190.85" dur="4.02">subjective experience of course but this</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="4.05">is such an interesting testimonial for</text>
  <text start="194.87" dur="4.29">c60 I had to share it with you and this</text>
  <text start="197.18" dur="4.7">is not alone there are many out there</text>
  <text start="199.16" dur="4.829">who are seeing benefit from this stuff</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="3.609">experimenting on their own health taking</text>
  <text start="203.989" dur="3.81">their own health into their own hands</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="4.921">rather than trusting the establishment</text>
  <text start="207.799" dur="3.991">and and the doctors who have for better</text>
  <text start="210.41" dur="3.54">or worse been trained by the</text>
  <text start="211.79" dur="6.66">establishment you know the medical</text>
  <text start="213.95" dur="6.45">schools the the drug and government</text>
  <text start="218.45" dur="6.9">complex the revolving door between Big</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="7.38">Pharma and the FDA CDC you know these</text>
  <text start="225.35" dur="5.19">these people are letting us down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="227.78" dur="5.85">killing us then the real healers are</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="4.71">being killed this is something that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.63" dur="2.94">not a cure-all it&amp;#39;s not a miracle or</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="4.41">anything like that but it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="236.57" dur="8.699">that may just impact everyone on such a</text>
  <text start="239.66" dur="6.389">strong way and so cheaply that it could</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="3.991">change everything</text>
  <text start="246.049" dur="4.53">it could break big pharma there&amp;#39;s a few</text>
  <text start="249.26" dur="3.96">other things out there that have that</text>
  <text start="250.579" dur="5.281">kind of you know potential you know I</text>
