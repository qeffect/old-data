  <text start="25.6" dur="3.88">good afternoon guys this is Sydney</text>
  <text start="28.07" dur="3.12">otherwise known as deep they shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="29.48" dur="3">bail and I have a couple of very</text>
  <text start="31.19" dur="3.24">important things to discuss with you</text>
  <text start="32.48" dur="5.37">guys today as well as a very big</text>
  <text start="34.43" dur="6.62">announcements so as you guys know I</text>
  <text start="37.85" dur="5.18">started off in political activism as</text>
  <text start="41.05" dur="4.09">just a constitutional conservative</text>
  <text start="43.03" dur="3.61">addressing general issues that affect</text>
  <text start="45.14" dur="4.98">society at large and proved to be</text>
  <text start="46.64" dur="4.95">influential and as time has gone on and</text>
  <text start="50.12" dur="2.82">my activism has progressed into</text>
  <text start="51.59" dur="3.21">something that has become more</text>
  <text start="52.94" dur="4.799">popularized among the right-wing as I</text>
  <text start="54.8" dur="5.31">have gained more support my work has</text>
  <text start="57.739" dur="4.32">focused primarily within the area of</text>
  <text start="60.11" dur="4.32">addressing censorship because as all of</text>
  <text start="62.059" dur="4.731">you know having started out as somewhat</text>
  <text start="64.43" dur="5.16">of a moderate right-wing individual</text>
  <text start="66.79" dur="5.05">libertarian so to speak I myself have</text>
  <text start="69.59" dur="4.58">been the target of numerous instances of</text>
  <text start="71.84" dur="4.56">physical intimidation and harassment by</text>
  <text start="74.17" dur="4.42">domestic terrorist organizations on the</text>
  <text start="76.4" dur="3.66">left wing notably and Tifa and black</text>
  <text start="78.59" dur="3.93">lives matter and things that are similar</text>
  <text start="80.06" dur="4.169">to those particular groups</text>
  <text start="82.52" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;ve been docked at least four five</text>
  <text start="84.229" dur="3.99">times have been shut down on virtually</text>
  <text start="85.76" dur="3.899">every single social media sites that</text>
  <text start="88.219" dur="3.421">I&amp;#39;ve attempted to use there&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="89.659" dur="4.71">Twitter YouTube Facebook and the</text>
  <text start="91.64" dur="5.28">blogging website medium primarily I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="94.369" dur="4.771">engaged with some of these people and</text>
  <text start="96.92" dur="3.51">physical confrontations at events I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="99.14" dur="2.43">tried to talk to them and debate them</text>
  <text start="100.43" dur="3.359">and of course they never want to</text>
  <text start="101.57" dur="5.31">facilitate an actual discussion but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="103.789" dur="5.25">noticed that not only has censorship and</text>
  <text start="106.88" dur="4.14">daxing and harassment and all these</text>
  <text start="109.039" dur="4.29">other tactics the left loves to resort</text>
  <text start="111.02" dur="3.9">to been a problem within my own personal</text>
  <text start="113.329" dur="3.631">work and political activism but this has</text>
  <text start="114.92" dur="4.35">become a widespread problem across the</text>
  <text start="116.96" dur="4.829">right wing to the degree that not only</text>
  <text start="119.27" dur="3.36">are people being harassed and Docs and</text>
  <text start="121.789" dur="2.72">having their personal information</text>
  <text start="122.63" dur="4.68">released on the internet for the sake of</text>
  <text start="124.509" dur="4.631">intimidation and strategic terrorism but</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="3.63">many of them have been subject to things</text>
  <text start="129.14" dur="4.2">that even extend the severity of that</text>
  <text start="130.94" dur="4.26">being that many of them have actually</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="3.96">had their bank accounts shut down</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="4.26">through Chase many of them for no reason</text>
  <text start="137.3" dur="3.87">at all have been deprived of their most</text>
  <text start="139.46" dur="3.72">precious resource that they have in</text>
  <text start="141.17" dur="4.77">terms of materialism that being their</text>
  <text start="143.18" dur="4.53">monetary and financial resources we have</text>
  <text start="145.94" dur="3.93">now reached a period of time that is</text>
  <text start="147.71" dur="3.87">very reminiscent to 1984 that being that</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="3.93">we are entering into a period of time in</text>
  <text start="151.58" dur="3.9">which everything every resource is</text>
  <text start="153.8" dur="2.37">becoming manipulated according to a</text>
  <text start="155.48" dur="1.71">political</text>
  <text start="156.17" dur="3.179">though that of course being the</text>
  <text start="157.19" dur="5.82">authoritarian communist agenda of the</text>
  <text start="159.349" dur="5.431">left-wing and anyone that dare is se</text>
  <text start="163.01" dur="4.32">audacity to demonstrate individual</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="4.89">thought and question the narrative of</text>
  <text start="167.33" dur="4.769">the left has been subsequently subject</text>
  <text start="169.67" dur="5.31">to a variety of means to attempt to</text>
  <text start="172.099" dur="4.951">silence them and shut them down so as</text>
  <text start="174.98" dur="3.479">all of you know my personal activism has</text>
  <text start="177.05" dur="3.87">been focused in that direction in</text>
  <text start="178.459" dur="3.691">combating the censorship against the</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="3.12">right wing but in addition to that</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="4.559">exposing the terrorism and the</text>
  <text start="184.04" dur="4.5">subversive evil nature of these</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="4.401">alternative left organizations that</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="4.74">claim to be fighting fascism and</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="4.12">totalitarianism but in actuality are</text>
  <text start="193.28" dur="4.11">doing nothing more other than engaging</text>
  <text start="195.23" dur="4.819">in acts of terrorism and overall</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="5.55">attempting to shut down any political</text>
  <text start="200.049" dur="4.361">discussion and civil discourse so this</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="3.09">has been my emphasis for quite some time</text>
  <text start="204.41" dur="4.17">now actually for the majority of my</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="5.91">activism as I&amp;#39;ve begun to experience</text>
  <text start="208.58" dur="4.77">these things and I feel the need to do</text>
  <text start="211.94" dur="3.72">something about it I feel the need to</text>
  <text start="213.35" dur="3.75">essentially take an initiative to</text>
  <text start="215.66" dur="3.27">address these issues and to provide a</text>
  <text start="217.1" dur="3.66">banner under which all conservatives</text>
  <text start="218.93" dur="3.059">right-wingers libertarians and other</text>
  <text start="220.76" dur="3">individuals who have been subject to</text>
  <text start="221.989" dur="4.141">this type of abuse to essentially rally</text>
  <text start="223.76" dur="4.05">under under one commonality that being</text>
  <text start="226.13" dur="4.02">the celebration and embrace of free</text>
  <text start="227.81" dur="3.84">speech and constitutionalism against</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="4.44">those who would deprive us of those</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="4.589">inherent rights so in order to do that</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="3.42">I&amp;#39;ve partnered with a good friend of</text>
  <text start="236.239" dur="3.991">mine named Dustin emos it was quite a</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="4.289">successful businessman and he and I are</text>
  <text start="240.23" dur="4.5">embarking upon this project that we call</text>
  <text start="242.299" dur="4.56">stop pit burning calm now</text>
  <text start="244.73" dur="4.289">the term bit burning is essentially the</text>
  <text start="246.859" dur="3.301">electronic and modern form of book</text>
  <text start="249.019" dur="3.69">burning which all of you are very</text>
  <text start="250.16" dur="4.62">familiar with as I&amp;#39;m sure all of you</text>
  <text start="252.709" dur="4.471">have read these dystopian novels that</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="3.929">were used to essentially illustrate the</text>
  <text start="257.18" dur="3.119">terrifying possibilities of</text>
  <text start="258.709" dur="5.251">totalitarianism in the future those</text>
  <text start="260.299" dur="6.751">books being 1984 the brave new world and</text>
  <text start="263.96" dur="5.73">things of that nature Fahrenheit 451</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="4.11">things of that nature all of these</text>
  <text start="269.69" dur="4.62">different texts have Illustrated at the</text>
  <text start="271.16" dur="4.979">same point and that point is this is the</text>
  <text start="274.31" dur="4.079">inevitable future that we face if we do</text>
  <text start="276.139" dur="4.621">not choose to take a stand against</text>
  <text start="278.389" dur="3.78">censorship and authoritarianism and all</text>
  <text start="280.76" dur="3.87">these other things so this is precisely</text>
  <text start="282.169" dur="5.631">why we have launched what we call stop</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="4.86">bit burning calm which is to address the</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="3.339">classical tactics</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="3.66">the left-wing and attempting to shut</text>
  <text start="291.139" dur="3.331">down free speech and we have a variety</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="3.81">of methods to address this but</text>
  <text start="294.47" dur="4.47">essentially the number one goal of stop</text>
  <text start="296.96" dur="4.709">bit burning is to unify conservatives</text>
  <text start="298.94" dur="5.31">and provide them a place to receive</text>
  <text start="301.669" dur="3.87">updates pertaining to censorship and all</text>
  <text start="304.25" dur="3.72">these things that we&amp;#39;re being subject to</text>
  <text start="305.539" dur="4.35">but also to launch an initiative to</text>
  <text start="307.97" dur="3.84">break apart the authoritarian</text>
  <text start="309.889" dur="3.691">technological monopolies and</text>
  <text start="311.81" dur="3.75">corporations that have essentially</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="4.619">facilitated this censorship and bias</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="5.37">against conservative thinkers so our</text>
  <text start="318.199" dur="4.44">main initiative here in addition to</text>
  <text start="320.93" dur="4.65">unifying the right-wing and taking a</text>
  <text start="322.639" dur="5.43">stand against censorship is to create an</text>
  <text start="325.58" dur="4.26">opposition against these corporations</text>
  <text start="328.069" dur="3.57">and these organizations these social</text>
  <text start="329.84" dur="5.639">media outlets so on and so forth and</text>
  <text start="331.639" dur="5.581">insist upon using their power in a way</text>
  <text start="335.479" dur="3.961">that manipulates the political narrative</text>
  <text start="337.22" dur="4.47">to shut down free speech and civil</text>
  <text start="339.44" dur="5.219">discourse so we are taking the fight to</text>
  <text start="341.69" dur="4.14">big text so to speak and in order to do</text>
  <text start="344.659" dur="3.48">that we were actually launching a</text>
  <text start="345.83" dur="5.01">lawsuit against all of these</text>
  <text start="348.139" dur="5.161">corporations that have been so</text>
  <text start="350.84" dur="4.71">vehemently opposed to the celebration</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="4.38">and expression of free thought and free</text>
  <text start="355.55" dur="3.78">speech so this is going to be quite an</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="4.079">interesting project to do I am creating</text>
  <text start="359.33" dur="5.1">content both articles and videos for the</text>
  <text start="361.759" dur="4.261">site for staff at burning calm and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.43" dur="4.14">hoping to get a hashtag out there and</text>
  <text start="366.02" dur="5.429">address this issue through this term bit</text>
  <text start="368.57" dur="4.439">burning the modern technological form of</text>
  <text start="371.449" dur="3.451">book burning this is precisely the</text>
  <text start="373.009" dur="4.891">problem in modern society and it is one</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="5.519">that we intend to address with all means</text>
  <text start="377.9" dur="4.859">of unified constitutionalism and</text>
  <text start="380.419" dur="4.981">patriotism that we can use at our</text>
  <text start="382.759" dur="4.56">disposal to unify people across this</text>
  <text start="385.4" dur="4.47">country irrespective of whether you</text>
  <text start="387.319" dur="4.981">agree with us fully whether you simply</text>
  <text start="389.87" dur="4.109">have your skepticism of the left-wing we</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="2.959">advocate for free speech of every</text>
  <text start="393.979" dur="3.301">American because that is an inherent</text>
  <text start="395.259" dur="3.551">constitutional right that we possess and</text>
  <text start="397.28" dur="4.979">that is precisely what we are fighting</text>
  <text start="398.81" dur="7.139">for here to understand just how</text>
  <text start="402.259" dur="5.731">important it is we&amp;#39;ve seen so many</text>
  <text start="405.949" dur="3.631">people unjustifiably shut down in</text>
  <text start="407.99" dur="4.95">silence as a result of their political</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="6.3">views no longer can we rescind within</text>
  <text start="412.94" dur="4.979">the hands of tyrants the constitutional</text>
  <text start="415.88" dur="3.959">liberties granted to us not by the hand</text>
  <text start="417.919" dur="4.831">of man but by the hand of divinity and</text>
  <text start="419.839" dur="5.131">it is solely upon that basis that we</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="4.83">act accordingly in addressing this very</text>
  <text start="424.97" dur="5.34">ominous and prominent threat that</text>
  <text start="427.58" dur="5.13">threatens not just us but every single</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="5.1">American that possesses the current</text>
  <text start="432.71" dur="5.37">right to speak and the willingness to do</text>
  <text start="435.41" dur="4.2">so so I&amp;#39;m very much looking forward to</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="3.39">sharing updates with you guys and then</text>
  <text start="439.61" dur="3.03">your future pertaining to stop it</text>
  <text start="441.47" dur="3.3">burning calm</text>
  <text start="442.64" dur="3.72">I will also be like I said producing</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="3.51">content for this website and sharing</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="3.6">that and making it circulate throughout</text>
  <text start="448.28" dur="3.6">social media as well and I look forward</text>
  <text start="449.96" dur="5.459">to sharing more updates with you guys on</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="6.56">that topic in the near future it is time</text>
  <text start="455.419" dur="5.131">to unite it is time to fight back</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="5.229">against censorship and against</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="5.79">totalitarianism in the name of all that</text>
  <text start="463.669" dur="4.531">is American all that is patriotic and</text>
  <text start="466.34" dur="3.27">all that matters to us both morally</text>
  <text start="468.2" dur="4.71">politically culturally and</text>
  <text start="469.61" dur="5.84">philosophically in this country stop the</text>
  <text start="472.91" dur="2.54">big burning</text>
