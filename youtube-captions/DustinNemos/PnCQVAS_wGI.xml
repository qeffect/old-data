  <text start="0.86" dur="5.11">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="3.06" dur="4.859">demos of destiny most calm and I wanted</text>
  <text start="5.97" dur="3.9">to talk very briefly with you guys this</text>
  <text start="7.919" dur="4.291">is gonna be a quick video just to kind</text>
  <text start="9.87" dur="3.78">of get the idea out there I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="12.21" dur="4.8">what to think of it I&amp;#39;d like to get some</text>
  <text start="13.65" dur="5.81">input from you guys but someone has sent</text>
  <text start="17.01" dur="4.65">me something basically suggesting that</text>
  <text start="19.46" dur="5.819">perhaps part of the plan is that</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="5.789">Cavanaugh fail the nomination and then</text>
  <text start="25.279" dur="5.131">Trump gets the lady that he actually</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="6.151">wanted and originally into the position</text>
  <text start="30.41" dur="4.989">but in so doing like why go through all</text>
  <text start="33.6" dur="3.99">the trouble in so doing not only to</text>
  <text start="35.399" dur="4.5">distract the Democrats but possibly and</text>
  <text start="37.59" dur="4.379">you know I I kind of I thought about</text>
  <text start="39.899" dur="3.631">this before and then Q said Kavanagh</text>
  <text start="41.969" dur="2.461">will be confirmed and then I was like</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="3.42">nevermind</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="3.96">apparently he will get in but now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="46.95" dur="4.499">thinking maybe disinformation is</text>
  <text start="48.39" dur="6.03">necessary in this case apparently some</text>
  <text start="51.449" dur="4.651">of the records that were pulled out were</text>
  <text start="54.42" dur="3.029">potentially classified I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="3.509">confirmed this but potentially where</text>
  <text start="57.449" dur="3.781">they were classified some of the things</text>
  <text start="59.609" dur="3.93">that the Democrats were requesting about</text>
  <text start="61.23" dur="5.61">Kavanagh could have brought out some</text>
  <text start="63.539" dur="5.161">some dirt on Bush and others from back</text>
  <text start="66.84" dur="5.43">when Kavanagh had covered some things up</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="5.4">for them so by no means is Kavanagh</text>
  <text start="72.27" dur="3.3">completely spotless I mean they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="3.659">after him for some stupid things that</text>
  <text start="75.57" dur="4.909">are completely BS obviously this whole</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="5.4">sexual assault thing is a smear campaign</text>
  <text start="80.479" dur="4.661">but he does have a history working with</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="4.71">the bushes and he and he was involved in</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="5.61">some cover-ups at least to the best of</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="6.121">my knowledge here so with that said</text>
  <text start="90.75" dur="6.21">maybe part of the plan here was to to</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="4.739">let them dig into him as hard as they</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="3.51">could pull out some of this dirt on the</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="3.631">bushes that might lead back to some more</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="4.859">swamp draining later on down the road</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="4.98">and who knows right I don&amp;#39;t know for</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="3.451">sure this is completely conjecture I</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="4.05">just wanted to get the idea out there</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="5.31">because if Cavanaugh fails to be</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="5.88">confirmed that seems to be the next most</text>
  <text start="114.09" dur="6.27">likely course we&amp;#39;ll see what happens</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="5.25">obviously Trump is pushing Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="120.36" dur="5.28">even Q is pushing Cavanaugh maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.52" dur="4.559">to confuse the bad guys I don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="4.55">I would sure like to get your opinions</text>
  <text start="127.079" dur="3.111">on it in the comments below</text>
