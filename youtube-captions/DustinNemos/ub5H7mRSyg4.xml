  <text start="0" dur="6.45">okay welcome back my friends this is</text>
  <text start="3.6" dur="5.93">destiny most of destiny most calm and I</text>
  <text start="6.45" dur="5.76">am joined by Ginny Silcox who is and</text>
  <text start="9.53" dur="4.72">she&amp;#39;s hesitant to say the word expert</text>
  <text start="12.21" dur="5.239">but someone who has a lot of prior</text>
  <text start="14.25" dur="6.21">experience in the e/m electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="17.449" dur="4.961">background both in research and training</text>
  <text start="20.46" dur="5.01">and she&amp;#39;s gonna help us to figure out</text>
  <text start="22.41" dur="6.27">what is going on kind of in California</text>
  <text start="25.47" dur="5.52">and in them the state of technology as</text>
  <text start="28.68" dur="4.53">far as iam weaponry goes today and some</text>
  <text start="30.99" dur="4.499">of the dangers that go with go with that</text>
  <text start="33.21" dur="3.599">so did any thank you so much for joining</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="5.611">us and taking the time out of your</text>
  <text start="36.809" dur="7.231">schedule and welcome thank you yeah so</text>
  <text start="41.1" dur="5.01">we we talked a little bit about this</text>
  <text start="44.04" dur="5.039">topic before the show you&amp;#39;ve brought a</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="5.219">couple of potential infographics and</text>
  <text start="49.079" dur="4.32">slides that we may use to show this as</text>
  <text start="51.329" dur="4.861">well I&amp;#39;m gonna have to also ask to</text>
  <text start="53.399" dur="5.91">remember those of us like myself who are</text>
  <text start="56.19" dur="6.509">not trained in science as a primary</text>
  <text start="59.309" dur="4.89">background so keep the the simple</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="3.78">version out there as well for everyone</text>
  <text start="64.199" dur="3.391">to understand oh yeah that was that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="4.171">what I need your help</text>
  <text start="67.59" dur="4.86">yeah yeah you know I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve heard of</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="4.62">interesting things like magnetrons from</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="4.919">microwaves being turned into like a wave</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="4.38">weapons or something like that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="3.721">possible yeah this is not what this</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="3.87">technology is using anymore</text>
  <text start="81.09" dur="6.45">yeah it&amp;#39;s getting a little bit too</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="5.309">finicky and not powerful enough yeah and</text>
  <text start="87.54" dur="3.42">what what they&amp;#39;re doing now is</text>
  <text start="88.829" dur="3.36">potentially you know we&amp;#39;re seeing you</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="3.33">know I talked to I talked with you about</text>
  <text start="92.189" dur="3.451">it before some of the strange situations</text>
  <text start="94.29" dur="4.17">where there&amp;#39;s aluminum that&amp;#39;s melted</text>
  <text start="95.64" dur="5.1">whereas the plastic is largely unburned</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="5.25">usually that takes almost 1300 degrees</text>
  <text start="100.74" dur="5.73">if I&amp;#39;m correct so yeah range situation I</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="4.89">actually have them a paragraph that</text>
  <text start="106.47" dur="5.219">describes what happens with aluminum and</text>
  <text start="108.6" dur="5.67">I wonder if you&amp;#39;d like to hear this this</text>
  <text start="111.689" dur="4.741">is some of the originally experiments</text>
  <text start="114.27" dur="6.48">they did looking at microwaves for a</text>
  <text start="116.43" dur="7.229">propulsion purpose rather than for an</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="6.54">oven they were doing laboratory</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="5.49">experiments because they accidentally at</text>
  <text start="127.29" dur="5.74">one point they accidentally discovered</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="7.091">this is in the 40s they discovered that</text>
  <text start="133.03" dur="4.98">putting microwaves through a very like</text>
  <text start="136.24" dur="6.27">if you took two aluminum cookie sheets</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="6.84">and place them one wavelength apart</text>
  <text start="142.51" dur="4.65">fairly narrow and then you put a</text>
  <text start="144.85" dur="4.7">microwave transmitter at one side of it</text>
  <text start="147.16" dur="5.34">it actually blew a pencil off the desk</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="6.12">yeah that time they were not aware at</text>
  <text start="152.5" dur="4.92">all they weren&amp;#39;t aware that</text>
  <text start="155.67" dur="5.14">electromagnetic energy could actually</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="5.37">have like a physical effect you know</text>
  <text start="160.81" dur="5.79">that they they were more used to the</text>
  <text start="162.79" dur="5.04">typical radio type idea where you know</text>
  <text start="166.6" dur="3.51">you have to have all the circuitry</text>
  <text start="167.83" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s receiving the waves and then</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;ll do its processing and turn it into</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="5.85">a sound but they discovered that these</text>
  <text start="175.69" dur="5.549">microwaves were capable of shooting a</text>
  <text start="178.3" dur="4.98">pencil off of the desk we&amp;#39;ve heard you</text>
  <text start="181.239" dur="3.811">know stories of secret projects for the</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="5.01">military and they&amp;#39;re researching how to</text>
  <text start="185.05" dur="5.24">use a anti-gravity propulsion with with</text>
  <text start="188.29" dur="5.37">magnets and things of that nature and</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="6.759">it&amp;#39;s far beyond that yeah and actually</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="5.82">that works the sources the secrets of</text>
  <text start="197.049" dur="4.951">anti-gravity propulsion about all the</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="4.319">violet and it&amp;#39;s a bad title because it</text>
  <text start="202" dur="4.35">looks so hocus-pocus but it&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="203.799" dur="4.261">book filled with real science and the</text>
  <text start="206.35" dur="3.359">history of science well that&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="2.85">going into it let&amp;#39;s address that and you</text>
  <text start="209.709" dur="3.331">know some people are gonna call this a</text>
  <text start="210.91" dur="3.24">conspiracy video or conspiracy theory</text>
  <text start="213.04" dur="4.11">you know I think there&amp;#39;s legitimate</text>
  <text start="214.15" dur="4.92">questions to be asked based on just the</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="3.089">the modern state of Technology even just</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="5.49">the things that you can find on the</text>
  <text start="220.239" dur="5.881">Internet yeah of that the patents that I</text>
  <text start="224.56" dur="4.83">would like to talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="7.8">today we&amp;#39;re from a Mikey Hughes Aircraft</text>
  <text start="229.39" dur="8.099">Corporation Raytheon and Google so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.92" dur="5.129">see how hocus pocus all that is yes yes</text>
  <text start="237.489" dur="4.801">indeed there probably is but we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.049" dur="4.681">know about it yeah yeah people use this</text>
  <text start="242.29" dur="4.02">word conspiracy link it&amp;#39;s some sort of</text>
  <text start="243.73" dur="4.08">like abnormal thing I mean anytime two</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="5.97">people get together and plot I mean</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="7.26">that&amp;#39;s a conspiracy yeah no I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="252.28" dur="5.22">really emphasizing can spoil for me okay</text>
  <text start="255.07" dur="4.77">for me there I&amp;#39;m looking at the fires in</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="5.46">California yeah that&amp;#39;s kind of the gist</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="4.2">and it all started for me I mean I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="262.96" dur="5.54">been in electromagnet</text>
  <text start="264.04" dur="8.07">compatibility research since the 80s</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="6.16">first I had a teaching degree and my</text>
  <text start="272.11" dur="3.96">concentration was actually music and so</text>
  <text start="274.66" dur="4.77">I was already Kim had already had</text>
  <text start="276.07" dur="4.08">physics and acoustics and and had a real</text>
  <text start="279.43" dur="3.45">thirst</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="4.41">I got an electronic keyboard and I</text>
  <text start="282.88" dur="4.22">really wanted to understand more about</text>
  <text start="284.56" dur="6.93">electronics so I went back school and</text>
  <text start="287.1" dur="6.07">ended up working in R&amp;amp;D for light-based</text>
  <text start="291.49" dur="4.4">medical instruments doing</text>
  <text start="293.17" dur="4.77">electromagnetic compliance testing</text>
  <text start="295.89" dur="4.09">interesting yeah now we hear about the</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="4.47">life I technology you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.98" dur="4.02">another way down the road well you know</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="4.44">and there&amp;#39;s still a lot of mysteries in</text>
  <text start="304" dur="5.34">my world I&amp;#39;m still I mean although I</text>
  <text start="306.85" dur="6.03">understand the basics I&amp;#39;m still looking</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="6.72">at the ryf research and all those</text>
  <text start="312.88" dur="5.12">different types of healing thomas Valona</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="5.64">has a great book on the bio</text>
  <text start="318" dur="6.25">electromagnetic healing Anna about the</text>
  <text start="321.7" dur="7.11">by one of his devices I&amp;#39;m actually about</text>
  <text start="324.25" dur="6.45">to start the the back protocol get the</text>
  <text start="328.81" dur="4.02">immortal blood yeah see how that goes</text>
  <text start="330.7" dur="3.84">cop well that&amp;#39;s a better way of getting</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="4.83">immortal blood than the other way right</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="5.76">yeah yeah definitely</text>
  <text start="337.66" dur="4.74">oh I mean read this paragraph and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="3.59">understand what happened was after they</text>
  <text start="342.4" dur="4.56">blew the pencils off the desk</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="6.85">hmm they decided to start experimenting</text>
  <text start="346.96" dur="6">and what happened in that case was they</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="3.75">actually had resonance and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="352.96" dur="3.57">how many people in your audience would</text>
  <text start="354.49" dur="4.92">remember those old memory commercials</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="5.88">that were on TV where the opera singer</text>
  <text start="359.41" dur="5.55">is singing at the glass wineglass and it</text>
  <text start="362.41" dur="5.61">just she has a certain note and it just</text>
  <text start="364.96" dur="5.55">shatters yeah he basically hit the</text>
  <text start="368.02" dur="5.64">resonant frequency of the wine glass and</text>
  <text start="370.51" dur="5.7">it vibrated so violently that it could</text>
  <text start="373.66" dur="5.01">not hold itself together and in that</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="4.71">little tiny experience you can see what</text>
  <text start="378.67" dur="4.56">happened to the World Trade Center it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="380.92" dur="5.97">basically the same idea and you can see</text>
  <text start="383.23" dur="5.82">every every general every every</text>
  <text start="386.89" dur="5.64">psychopath suddenly thought ooh a new</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="6.51">type of weapon yeah yeah dr. Strangelove</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="3.69">type weapon mm-hmm yeah so here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="395.56" dur="6.63">paragraph</text>
  <text start="396.22" dur="7.86">okay so what they decided that the</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="3.54">reason two pencils flew off the desk is</text>
  <text start="404.08" dur="4.14">that they actually because they were</text>
  <text start="405.73" dur="4.88">wood and graphite that they were made of</text>
  <text start="408.22" dur="5.67">two materials that reacted differently</text>
  <text start="410.61" dur="7.21">to the signal and those two materials</text>
  <text start="413.89" dur="7.59">reacted so differently that they</text>
  <text start="417.82" dur="6.23">literally responded to the weeps coming</text>
  <text start="421.48" dur="4.83">through and started rolling the pencils</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="4.84">mm-hmm because you know you&amp;#39;ve got that</text>
  <text start="426.31" dur="6.18">graphite core and the wood around it and</text>
  <text start="428.89" dur="4.92">and all that so anyway they experimented</text>
  <text start="432.49" dur="4.17">with a whole lot of different kinds of</text>
  <text start="433.81" dur="8.04">samples to find out which ones responded</text>
  <text start="436.66" dur="7.65">best brick and concrete are essentially</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="4.05">transparent to microwaves but they found</text>
  <text start="444.31" dur="3.75">that some materials would move quite</text>
  <text start="445.9" dur="5.52">violently where others would just</text>
  <text start="448.06" dur="4.65">vaporize aluminum foil would move but</text>
  <text start="451.42" dur="3.51">what then does in the cream upon</text>
  <text start="452.71" dur="5.49">exposure they carried out extensive</text>
  <text start="454.93" dur="5.19">extensive tests subjecting various kinds</text>
  <text start="458.2" dur="4.65">of materials to microwave waveforms of</text>
  <text start="460.12" dur="4.98">varying shapes and accumulated data on</text>
  <text start="462.85" dur="4.65">the destructive and burning materials on</text>
  <text start="465.1" dur="5.49">and on the effect of shockwaves on those</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="5.07">materials that responded so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="470.59" dur="5.25">little idea about what&amp;#39;s happening in</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="5.55">California people have seen so many</text>
  <text start="475.84" dur="5.22">anomalies and they&amp;#39;ve seen those blue</text>
  <text start="478.12" dur="6.21">waves you know the blue they call them</text>
  <text start="481.06" dur="6.03">laser beams okay I wanted to talk to you</text>
  <text start="484.33" dur="6.03">is it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s so much more than a</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="5.88">laser beam that in order to deal with</text>
  <text start="490.36" dur="4.35">something that is unknown to us I really</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="4.08">think the more knowledge you have about</text>
  <text start="494.71" dur="5.16">it the better of a conceptualization you</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="5.22">have of what it is the better you can</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="4.89">deal with it and I&amp;#39;m still wrapping</text>
  <text start="502.27" dur="4.89">wrapping my own brain around what we can</text>
  <text start="504.76" dur="5.659">do to deal with it but in this last</text>
  <text start="507.16" dur="5.97">paragraph this is kind of interesting</text>
  <text start="510.419" dur="6.401">they found that the effects were very</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="5.49">frequency sensitive and that it was</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="5.94">really kind of a different</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="7.17">characteristic with each material and</text>
  <text start="522.76" dur="5.88">they also found that if the frequency</text>
  <text start="525.79" dur="3.66">was off by just a little bit the object</text>
  <text start="528.64" dur="6.629">would suddenly be</text>
  <text start="529.45" dur="8.52">price so that could explain why the</text>
  <text start="535.269" dur="6.151">World Trade Center only had 3% of its</text>
  <text start="537.97" dur="6.96">height in rubble and the majority of the</text>
  <text start="541.42" dur="5.19">material went up in the dust plume that</text>
  <text start="544.93" dur="4.349">came from that because it should have</text>
  <text start="546.61" dur="5.789">had 12 stories worth of rubble after it</text>
  <text start="549.279" dur="5.691">collapsed and it didn&amp;#39;t it only had</text>
  <text start="552.399" dur="5.701">three stories or something like that so</text>
  <text start="554.97" dur="8.2">basically that was everything in the</text>
  <text start="558.1" dur="7.979">buildings vaporizing and yeah an</text>
  <text start="563.17" dur="5.13">interesting word - but he described the</text>
  <text start="566.079" dur="3.241">experience in their lap at one time when</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="3.06">they were experimenting with various</text>
  <text start="569.32" dur="3.93">frequency they had turned on their</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="4.8">microwave generator and it produced a</text>
  <text start="573.25" dur="5.029">blueish microwave beam that blew a hole</text>
  <text start="576.16" dur="4.35">in there in their laboratory wall and</text>
  <text start="578.279" dur="4.75">continued through and adjoining outside</text>
  <text start="580.51" dur="3.99">embankment as well the beam was going</text>
  <text start="583.029" dur="4.021">into another building before they</text>
  <text start="584.5" dur="4.649">managed to shut it off it scared the</text>
  <text start="587.05" dur="3.839">living daylights out of them so you</text>
  <text start="589.149" dur="4.221">think this is what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="590.889" dur="5.19">California with these visible beams</text>
  <text start="593.37" dur="5.5">metal melting before plastic in some</text>
  <text start="596.079" dur="4.081">situations just strange occurrences yeah</text>
  <text start="598.87" dur="5.79">and I&amp;#39;d like to kind of get into a</text>
  <text start="600.16" dur="6.03">little bit about why you&amp;#39;re number one</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="3.929">you can&amp;#39;t see the thing that&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="606.19" dur="4.38">doing the melting and there and I could</text>
  <text start="608.589" dur="3.631">describe this technology in detail it</text>
  <text start="610.57" dur="3.81">probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be that useful to</text>
  <text start="612.22" dur="5.67">people but there are some basic physics</text>
  <text start="614.38" dur="5.459">principles behind this that really as I</text>
  <text start="617.89" dur="5.28">said they have me rapping trying to wrap</text>
  <text start="619.839" dur="5.581">my head around what we could do to keep</text>
  <text start="623.17" dur="4.59">ourselves alive in the event of another</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="5.789">attack like this because I do regard</text>
  <text start="627.76" dur="7.35">that as an attack and and I also think</text>
  <text start="631.209" dur="5.581">Dustin that you know we are kind of a</text>
  <text start="635.11" dur="4.05">community now we&amp;#39;re a community of</text>
  <text start="636.79" dur="4.5">people that are waking up and and the</text>
  <text start="639.16" dur="4.5">more I look at this kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="641.29" dur="6.69">they&amp;#39;re more I realize that I have been</text>
  <text start="643.66" dur="8.58">asleep you know here I have been in the</text>
  <text start="647.98" dur="6.69">sciences for all these years and now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="652.24" dur="4.529">reading what they were doing with it all</text>
  <text start="654.67" dur="3.99">along that I had no knowledge of and and</text>
  <text start="656.769" dur="4.5">I can understand it and I find it</text>
  <text start="658.66" dur="3.84">thoroughly frightening and if people are</text>
  <text start="661.269" dur="4.081">listening that</text>
  <text start="662.5" dur="6.15">children are that are of an age that can</text>
  <text start="665.35" dur="6.27">comprehend some violent gross stuff I</text>
  <text start="668.65" dur="6.15">would recommend a not have them listen</text>
  <text start="671.62" dur="4.14">to this video they should not have their</text>
  <text start="674.8" dur="4.77">kids listen to this</text>
  <text start="675.76" dur="6.63">the remainder of our video</text>
  <text start="679.57" dur="4.56">yeah because basically what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="682.39" dur="5.31">describing is something that can part us</text>
  <text start="684.13" dur="6.09">out molecule by molecule if you think</text>
  <text start="687.7" dur="4.08">about how much water we contain and if</text>
  <text start="690.22" dur="5.37">you think about how a microwave oven</text>
  <text start="691.78" dur="6.45">works you know everything&amp;#39;s vibrating in</text>
  <text start="695.59" dur="6.72">nature all the atoms are vibrating they</text>
  <text start="698.23" dur="6.18">all have a normal range of excursion I</text>
  <text start="702.31" dur="5.49">guess I would say that they call that</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="9">Brownian motion and it&amp;#39;s in our reality</text>
  <text start="707.8" dur="9.33">it is what makes existence possible the</text>
  <text start="713.41" dur="5.46">fact that we have atoms that are loosely</text>
  <text start="717.13" dur="5.52">or tightly bound together you know</text>
  <text start="718.87" dur="8.22">tightly bound atoms and molecules are a</text>
  <text start="722.65" dur="6.96">solid and looser binding is water or a</text>
  <text start="727.09" dur="6.51">liquid and then even looser binding of</text>
  <text start="729.61" dur="7.35">between these particles is our guesses</text>
  <text start="733.6" dur="8.19">and so what happens inside of a</text>
  <text start="736.96" dur="6.48">microwave is the microwave you&amp;#39;ll never</text>
  <text start="741.79" dur="3.99">see my boys running in a different</text>
  <text start="743.44" dur="6.33">frequency they&amp;#39;re always going to be 2.5</text>
  <text start="745.78" dur="5.88">4 gigahertz because that has something</text>
  <text start="749.77" dur="5.04">to do with the vibration rate of water</text>
  <text start="751.66" dur="6.29">and it&amp;#39;s actually the the water in the</text>
  <text start="754.81" dur="5.55">food that is cooking in the microwave</text>
  <text start="757.95" dur="4.39">and that&amp;#39;s why microwaves are dangerous</text>
  <text start="760.36" dur="4.41">for us you know if you have a leaky old</text>
  <text start="762.34" dur="4.44">microwave you&amp;#39;re probably cooking part</text>
  <text start="764.77" dur="4.53">of yourself if you&amp;#39;re standing in front</text>
  <text start="766.78" dur="5.58">of it watching it while it&amp;#39;s cooking or</text>
  <text start="769.3" dur="5.7">he you know and I feel like Tesla warned</text>
  <text start="772.36" dur="4.38">us when he when he kind of good and bad</text>
  <text start="775" dur="3.78">things would come when he does so when</text>
  <text start="776.74" dur="4.2">he talked about the thinking of the</text>
  <text start="778.78" dur="3.33">universe in terms of vibrations and</text>
  <text start="780.94" dur="3.9">frequencies and things of that nature</text>
  <text start="782.11" dur="5.64">because the technology went this way you</text>
  <text start="784.84" dur="5.94">know yeah of being able to turn a home</text>
  <text start="787.75" dur="5.58">into rubble or destroy a building it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="790.78" dur="4.42">very along the lines of Tesla&amp;#39;s quote</text>
  <text start="793.33" dur="4.569">about being able to split the world</text>
  <text start="795.2" dur="5.189">in half imagine you was talking about</text>
  <text start="797.899" dur="3.661">mechanical risen it&amp;#39;s at the time well</text>
  <text start="800.389" dur="2.82">I&amp;#39;m sure there are a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="801.56" dur="3.209">just want to think of you know the</text>
  <text start="803.209" dur="2.25">option to turn a human being into that</text>
  <text start="804.769" dur="2.88">wine glass</text>
  <text start="805.459" dur="5.491">you know just shatter a human being that</text>
  <text start="807.649" dur="5.401">would be a u7 there you go and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="810.95" dur="5.4">why I wanted the kids go away for the</text>
  <text start="813.05" dur="5.729">rest of this video because there are I</text>
  <text start="816.35" dur="4.679">can go into some of the details and</text>
  <text start="818.779" dur="4.68">there&amp;#39;s one really important thing to</text>
  <text start="821.029" dur="4.831">realize that everybody says that this</text>
  <text start="823.459" dur="6.301">you know they see the lasers coming down</text>
  <text start="825.86" dur="8.219">from the sky and I have I have a theory</text>
  <text start="829.76" dur="8.12">about that and that that&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="834.079" dur="6.931">technology that I&amp;#39;d like to describe</text>
  <text start="837.88" dur="6.73">basically is it&amp;#39;s capable it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="841.01" dur="6.889">radar and radar runs in microwaves you</text>
  <text start="844.61" dur="6.18">know and and can I share my screen now</text>
  <text start="847.899" dur="6.43">go ahead this is time for that let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="850.79" dur="10.14">just take a look at I know how to do</text>
  <text start="854.329" dur="6.901">this okay okay let me get back to ya all</text>
  <text start="860.93" dur="1.74">right</text>
  <text start="861.23" dur="3.62">I want to get back to this thing right</text>
  <text start="862.67" dur="5.729">here how can you see that pretty well</text>
  <text start="864.85" dur="6.25">yes there&amp;#39;s a lot of information</text>
  <text start="868.399" dur="4.68">together so yeah what I like about this</text>
  <text start="871.1" dur="3.419">particular chart though is all those</text>
  <text start="873.079" dur="3.991">little objects you see down at the</text>
  <text start="874.519" dur="4.591">bottom are actually stacked vertically</text>
  <text start="877.07" dur="6.269">with the range of the frequency range</text>
  <text start="879.11" dur="6.87">that we&amp;#39;re looking at and so if you</text>
  <text start="883.339" dur="4.62">notice there are I really like this too</text>
  <text start="885.98" dur="5.82">because it has the biological effects on</text>
  <text start="887.959" dur="8.37">the second band there and this if you</text>
  <text start="891.8" dur="7.649">see the size the lowest sizes are in the</text>
  <text start="896.329" dur="6.211">radio range and that would be the Sutton</text>
  <text start="899.449" dur="5.521">the wavelength would be the size of a</text>
  <text start="902.54" dur="5.789">football field so obviously if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="904.97" dur="8.46">talking about microwaves they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="908.329" dur="9.24">that size they&amp;#39;re really small and so if</text>
  <text start="913.43" dur="6.779">you look at radar right there it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="917.569" dur="5.911">a little bit left in the middle you can</text>
  <text start="920.209" dur="6.841">see where a radar let&amp;#39;s see the dish</text>
  <text start="923.48" dur="5.67">down there yeah uh-huh 1 to 100</text>
  <text start="927.05" dur="3.81">gigahertz yeah well</text>
  <text start="929.15" dur="5.4">they have expanded on that since this</text>
  <text start="930.86" dur="6.36">chart was put out and think about radar</text>
  <text start="934.55" dur="5.79">technology is it uses feedback</text>
  <text start="937.22" dur="5.13">I think people in general probably know</text>
  <text start="940.34" dur="5.82">that radar is kind of like sonar that</text>
  <text start="942.35" dur="6.9">they use in naval navigation when they</text>
  <text start="946.16" dur="5.1">use sonar they they send a pulse out and</text>
  <text start="949.25" dur="4.44">if there&amp;#39;s an object out there it</text>
  <text start="951.26" dur="4.89">reflects the pulse back and granted the</text>
  <text start="953.69" dur="5.7">reflected energy is a little is a lot</text>
  <text start="956.15" dur="3.75">weaker than what they sent but getting</text>
  <text start="959.39" dur="3">that</text>
  <text start="959.9" dur="5.58">reflection back is how they can localize</text>
  <text start="962.39" dur="6.69">where that other sub or whatever a mine</text>
  <text start="965.48" dur="6.36">or whatever it is so the returning echo</text>
  <text start="969.08" dur="5.82">is what they&amp;#39;re using to locate that</text>
  <text start="971.84" dur="5.88">thing and radars basically the same only</text>
  <text start="974.9" dur="5.82">it uses light so they send out a pulse</text>
  <text start="977.72" dur="5.55">of electromagnetic energy and then the</text>
  <text start="980.72" dur="4.53">get back or return and they can think</text>
  <text start="983.27" dur="3.5">they can compute how long it took the</text>
  <text start="985.25" dur="3.62">signal to get over there and get back</text>
  <text start="986.77" dur="5.23">divide that in half and they know the</text>
  <text start="988.87" dur="5.92">distance to the object and so if they</text>
  <text start="992" dur="5.55">send out two pulses they can get the</text>
  <text start="994.79" dur="4.2">first distance and then they&amp;#39;ll send out</text>
  <text start="997.55" dur="3.57">another pulse and get the second</text>
  <text start="998.99" dur="4.77">distance and they can tell if the object</text>
  <text start="1001.12" dur="5.79">is moving because the second return</text>
  <text start="1003.76" dur="5.22">would be less time or more time than the</text>
  <text start="1006.91" dur="3.75">initial return so that&amp;#39;s how they tell</text>
  <text start="1008.98" dur="5">if a boat is moving towards them are</text>
  <text start="1010.66" dur="6.72">away from them or an airplane whatever</text>
  <text start="1013.98" dur="5.53">so that&amp;#39;s all well I&amp;#39;m good that&amp;#39;s uh</text>
  <text start="1017.38" dur="5.85">you know sending out a pulse and getting</text>
  <text start="1019.51" dur="6.03">back a really teeny return just a barely</text>
  <text start="1023.23" dur="4.74">enough reflection to actually sense it</text>
  <text start="1025.54" dur="4.32">and pick it up and and utilize a signal</text>
  <text start="1027.97" dur="4.619">to sense where something is in our</text>
  <text start="1029.86" dur="5.91">environment and now Google has gotten to</text>
  <text start="1032.589" dur="6.12">the point where they have micro radar</text>
  <text start="1035.77" dur="5.88">and they&amp;#39;re working on virtual commands</text>
  <text start="1038.709" dur="5.731">where you you are if you have virtual</text>
  <text start="1041.65" dur="5.7">reality goggles on and you see a push</text>
  <text start="1044.44" dur="6.63">button or something like that and you</text>
  <text start="1047.35" dur="6">push it just like your hands the Google</text>
  <text start="1051.07" dur="5.73">tiny radar system that they&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="1053.35" dur="5.1">up for virtual control will have you</text>
  <text start="1056.8" dur="3.63">visualize that you&amp;#39;re actually pushing a</text>
  <text start="1058.45" dur="3.49">button but you&amp;#39;re not pushing anything</text>
  <text start="1060.43" dur="4.15">you&amp;#39;re just making this movement</text>
  <text start="1061.94" dur="4.979">and their tiny micro radar picks up your</text>
  <text start="1064.58" dur="4.86">movement and they have it kept they</text>
  <text start="1066.919" dur="6.09">haven&amp;#39;t catalogued Wow so they go oh</text>
  <text start="1069.44" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s a button push well so very</text>
  <text start="1073.009" dur="5.701">they&amp;#39;re really advancing in the field of</text>
  <text start="1075.23" dur="5.37">radar yeah I would say that&amp;#39;s an amazing</text>
  <text start="1078.71" dur="3.809">VR you know they&amp;#39;ve got they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1080.6" dur="4.5">people in moles you know they do the the</text>
  <text start="1082.519" dur="5.671">trial run you can play a video game with</text>
  <text start="1085.1" dur="4.47">the the VRI and they have acting like</text>
  <text start="1088.19" dur="2.849">chickens there they&amp;#39;re just walking</text>
  <text start="1089.57" dur="5.579">around picking up food with their necks</text>
  <text start="1091.039" dur="7.89">it&amp;#39;s ridiculous they always come up with</text>
  <text start="1095.149" dur="7.02">some humiliating scenario what are they</text>
  <text start="1098.929" dur="8.191">are them acting like sheep exactly</text>
  <text start="1102.169" dur="6.39">exactly so so the reality in California</text>
  <text start="1107.12" dur="2.759">is not what people think it is it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1108.559" dur="4.441">as simple as that but these kind of</text>
  <text start="1109.879" dur="6.65">things still exist they do exist in</text>
  <text start="1113" dur="6.99">there and they&amp;#39;re advancing everyday and</text>
  <text start="1116.529" dur="5.171">I&amp;#39;m gonna go to a different slide right</text>
  <text start="1119.99" dur="7.049">now just to kind of give people an idea</text>
  <text start="1121.7" dur="6.569">of just okay well I&amp;#39;m not gonna do that</text>
  <text start="1127.039" dur="3.211">first slide because it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1128.269" dur="5.671">upsetting but you know probably</text>
  <text start="1130.25" dur="4.62">everybody see everybody is seeing the</text>
  <text start="1133.94" dur="3.9">sine-wave</text>
  <text start="1134.87" dur="6.74">you know the diagram of a typical signal</text>
  <text start="1137.84" dur="7.799">a pure signal and see how it&amp;#39;s curvy</text>
  <text start="1141.61" dur="6.01">it&amp;#39;s got all those nice little yeah but</text>
  <text start="1145.639" dur="4.561">if you notice down below you can have</text>
  <text start="1147.62" dur="4.2">other shapes and I&amp;#39;m not going to go</text>
  <text start="1150.2" dur="5.339">into the details of how these other</text>
  <text start="1151.82" dur="6.93">shapes are made but radar is like the</text>
  <text start="1155.539" dur="4.801">top one that&amp;#39;s the standard typical</text>
  <text start="1158.75" dur="6.69">radar signal would look something like</text>
  <text start="1160.34" dur="6.66">that but modified radar can look like</text>
  <text start="1165.44" dur="5.04">the one down low and you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1167" dur="6.299">really sharp Peaks mm-hmm and in the</text>
  <text start="1170.48" dur="3.96">research they were doing around 1960 and</text>
  <text start="1173.299" dur="4.921">this is mainly Hughes Aircraft</text>
  <text start="1174.44" dur="6.869">Corporation and then Raytheon they found</text>
  <text start="1178.22" dur="5.64">that when the peak approaches up and</text>
  <text start="1181.309" dur="5.1">then drops really fast and then slides</text>
  <text start="1183.86" dur="5.399">up and then drops really fast that has</text>
  <text start="1186.409" dur="5.22">one particular action on materials like</text>
  <text start="1189.259" dur="4.471">pencils and then when you reverse it and</text>
  <text start="1191.629" dur="3.421">you go up real fast and you taper down</text>
  <text start="1193.73" dur="4.41">and go up real fast</text>
  <text start="1195.05" dur="5.55">now that has another effect it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1198.14" dur="4.53">exact opposite you can push the pencil</text>
  <text start="1200.6" dur="2.46">or you can pull the pencil believe it or</text>
  <text start="1202.67" dur="3.87">not</text>
  <text start="1203.06" dur="6.68">Wow so that&amp;#39;s why I wanted to show that</text>
  <text start="1206.54" dur="5.37">now this is typically how we graph</text>
  <text start="1209.74" dur="5.41">electronic signals but I want to show</text>
  <text start="1211.91" dur="5.91">you a sound wave and here&amp;#39;s a sound wave</text>
  <text start="1215.15" dur="6.03">you know you know in a vacuum you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1217.82" dur="4.8">really have sound and that&amp;#39;s when they</text>
  <text start="1221.18" dur="4.38">have all these movies you know like</text>
  <text start="1222.62" dur="5.82">contact or or that one was I was a</text>
  <text start="1225.56" dur="4.35">Sandra Bullock gravity I think it was</text>
  <text start="1228.44" dur="3.27">called oh yeah yeah yeah I think I know</text>
  <text start="1229.91" dur="2.52">you know it&amp;#39;s like there there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1231.71" dur="4.17">sound</text>
  <text start="1232.43" dur="6.33">there&amp;#39;s no medium of air out there to</text>
  <text start="1235.88" dur="4.02">let the sound waves transmit the only</text>
  <text start="1238.76" dur="4.05">way they&amp;#39;re going to transmit would be</text>
  <text start="1239.9" dur="5.46">through metal like this the shell of a</text>
  <text start="1242.81" dur="4.53">spaceship or something like that but</text>
  <text start="1245.36" dur="5.88">down here on earth we have this ability</text>
  <text start="1247.34" dur="6.09">to a speaker cone will push a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1251.24" dur="4.2">air and then pull back and then push</text>
  <text start="1253.43" dur="4.8">some more air and it does it repeatedly</text>
  <text start="1255.44" dur="6.51">so that we can actually hear a sound our</text>
  <text start="1258.23" dur="6.03">our ears are made to receive the pulses</text>
  <text start="1261.95" dur="3.12">coming through in compression and</text>
  <text start="1264.26" dur="5.22">rarefaction</text>
  <text start="1265.07" dur="6.45">so that&amp;#39;s a typical sound wave and when</text>
  <text start="1269.48" dur="5.24">everybody throws around the term scalar</text>
  <text start="1271.52" dur="5.46">energy but they don&amp;#39;t know what it is</text>
  <text start="1274.72" dur="4.57">you know and I&amp;#39;ve heard some pretty yeah</text>
  <text start="1276.98" dur="4.1">pretty good definitions on the internet</text>
  <text start="1279.29" dur="5.25">but I&amp;#39;ve also seen some really bad</text>
  <text start="1281.08" dur="5.65">assumptions being made about it but</text>
  <text start="1284.54" dur="6.84">generally when you when you I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1286.73" dur="7.56">go back for a second to this thing the</text>
  <text start="1291.38" dur="4.47">little sine wave here represents the</text>
  <text start="1294.29" dur="4.01">strength of the electromagnetic field</text>
  <text start="1295.85" dur="6.81">you can see we&amp;#39;re graphing that</text>
  <text start="1298.3" dur="6.48">differently than we are this one and and</text>
  <text start="1302.66" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s because the wave physics has</text>
  <text start="1304.78" dur="5.89">regarded this and I would say probably</text>
  <text start="1307.04" dur="5.43">since right after Tesla physicists have</text>
  <text start="1310.67" dur="5.25">been trained only regard like Rho</text>
  <text start="1312.47" dur="5.76">magnetic energy this way a change in</text>
  <text start="1315.92" dur="3.93">field strength it&amp;#39;s we gets strong it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1318.23" dur="3.78">weak it&amp;#39;s wrong if you think about the</text>
  <text start="1319.85" dur="6.27">current and your walls you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1322.01" dur="6.93">running 60 of these per second an AC</text>
  <text start="1326.12" dur="5.129">current is strong</text>
  <text start="1328.94" dur="7.229">weak strong weak strong weak strong weak</text>
  <text start="1331.249" dur="9.18">that&amp;#39;s the AC in your walls okay so yeah</text>
  <text start="1336.169" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s a field strength this is actual</text>
  <text start="1340.429" dur="4.531">physical things molecules of air being</text>
  <text start="1343.279" dur="5.551">compressed and rarefied and compressed</text>
  <text start="1344.96" dur="6.299">and rarefied yeah so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1348.83" dur="7.049">this nice little physicist by the name</text>
  <text start="1351.259" dur="6.811">of Constantine Miele who has some</text>
  <text start="1355.879" dur="5.37">amazing lectures out there on YouTube</text>
  <text start="1358.07" dur="6.089">and he uncovered something that I found</text>
  <text start="1361.249" dur="5.28">fascinating and that is from a right</text>
  <text start="1364.159" dur="5.19">after or probably the last part of</text>
  <text start="1366.529" dur="7.411">Tesla&amp;#39;s life there was a split in the</text>
  <text start="1369.349" dur="6.991">physics community and from the 30s</text>
  <text start="1373.94" dur="6.869">Constantine Mile who is replicating all</text>
  <text start="1376.34" dur="5.789">the experiments of Tesla basically he</text>
  <text start="1380.809" dur="4.86">teaches physics I think at the</text>
  <text start="1382.129" dur="5.22">University of Copenhagen um maybe not</text>
  <text start="1385.669" dur="7.34">now he might have gone off on his own</text>
  <text start="1387.349" dur="8.971">anyway he noticed that certain</text>
  <text start="1393.009" dur="5.86">components to physics equations started</text>
  <text start="1396.32" dur="5.849">going missing after about 1930 it</text>
  <text start="1398.869" dur="6.601">dropped a certain components of how you</text>
  <text start="1402.169" dur="6.421">compute what a wave can you be we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1405.47" dur="6.569">missing as of the 1930s they dropped</text>
  <text start="1408.59" dur="7.049">them from the textbooks and i-i&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1412.039" dur="6.39">thinking back on what happened right if</text>
  <text start="1415.639" dur="6.6">you know right at the beginning of</text>
  <text start="1418.429" dur="6">Tesla&amp;#39;s projects you know Tesla and</text>
  <text start="1422.239" dur="3.69">Edison had that big argument about</text>
  <text start="1424.429" dur="3.21">nothing and then there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="1425.929" dur="2.641">simulation and then that era of</text>
  <text start="1427.639" dur="3.36">Technology yeah</text>
  <text start="1428.57" dur="5.039">and Tesla was very interested in</text>
  <text start="1430.999" dur="5.581">providing free electric power to people</text>
  <text start="1433.609" dur="4.53">Wardenclyffe project he was able to do</text>
  <text start="1436.58" dur="3.839">that yeah we just covered it yeah right</text>
  <text start="1438.139" dur="6.12">and they just had and they erected one</text>
  <text start="1440.419" dur="7.5">in Texas I think probably awesome yeah</text>
  <text start="1444.259" dur="7.681">I&amp;#39;m not sure where it is but anyway um</text>
  <text start="1447.919" dur="6.39">so what happened though was what was the</text>
  <text start="1451.94" dur="7.979">name of that guy I&amp;#39;m losing his name the</text>
  <text start="1454.309" dur="8.42">financier for Tesla who basically um he</text>
  <text start="1459.919" dur="2.81">was part of the</text>
  <text start="1463.5" dur="8.44">and oh yeah I was in Morgan</text>
  <text start="1468.01" dur="5.93">it wasn&amp;#39;t Morgan yes okay yeah he was</text>
  <text start="1471.94" dur="4.62">like well yeah where do we put the meter</text>
  <text start="1473.94" dur="4.92">we can&amp;#39;t if we can&amp;#39;t make money on it</text>
  <text start="1476.56" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;m not gonna back you of course</text>
  <text start="1478.86" dur="5.71">so you know but at that point I think</text>
  <text start="1482.29" dur="4.17">they were beginning to realize they</text>
  <text start="1484.57" dur="4.56">needed to start hiding a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="1486.46" dur="6.15">stuff about physics and so in a way</text>
  <text start="1489.13" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;ve kind of been in the dark for about</text>
  <text start="1492.61" dur="5.61">I would I would estimate about a third</text>
  <text start="1494.83" dur="8.76">of our knowledge in physics is missing</text>
  <text start="1498.22" dur="7.89">and when experiments go awry it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1503.59" dur="4.86">usually I think you can usually account</text>
  <text start="1506.11" dur="7.52">for it by the fact that we are not</text>
  <text start="1508.45" dur="8.4">considering that when you do this to</text>
  <text start="1513.63" dur="7.57">electrons not air molecules when you do</text>
  <text start="1516.85" dur="9.24">this kind of sawtooth pattern to not to</text>
  <text start="1521.2" dur="7.44">air molecules but to electric field when</text>
  <text start="1526.09" dur="4.89">you make it sharp enough pulse like that</text>
  <text start="1528.64" dur="6.75">you&amp;#39;re actually able to move a pencil</text>
  <text start="1530.98" dur="7.05">off a desk or you&amp;#39;re able to melt the</text>
  <text start="1535.39" dur="3.36">aluminum in car wheels set fires yeah</text>
  <text start="1538.03" dur="5.52">exactly</text>
  <text start="1538.75" dur="6.72">yeah or kill yeah so what this is is</text>
  <text start="1543.55" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s this is longitudinal little energy</text>
  <text start="1545.47" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re looking at in here and I have a</text>
  <text start="1547.72" dur="6.18">paper I have several papers actually</text>
  <text start="1549.88" dur="5.85">that have been put out by scientists in</text>
  <text start="1553.9" dur="5.7">other parts of the world not here in the</text>
  <text start="1555.73" dur="6.65">US yeah a particularly Russian the early</text>
  <text start="1559.6" dur="5.31">research was done by the Russians and</text>
  <text start="1562.38" dur="5.11">you know if people in your audience want</text>
  <text start="1564.91" dur="4.29">to debunk that I&amp;#39;m just gonna I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1567.49" dur="4.86">gonna talk about it I&amp;#39;m just gonna show</text>
  <text start="1569.2" dur="6.12">you an example let me see if I have it</text>
  <text start="1572.35" dur="5.73">here I and how much energy was something</text>
  <text start="1575.32" dur="4.5">like this take two you know like from</text>
  <text start="1578.08" dur="5.31">space or something - that&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="1579.82" dur="5.52">excellent question and it actually leads</text>
  <text start="1583.39" dur="5.43">me into the next thing that I want to</text>
  <text start="1585.34" dur="5.19">talk about because you know um you know</text>
  <text start="1588.82" dur="4.08">how are talking about how the molecules</text>
  <text start="1590.53" dur="4.15">are moving anyway mm-hmm well what if</text>
  <text start="1592.9" dur="6.76">you could make all the molecules kind of</text>
  <text start="1594.68" dur="6.42">at one time it would be kind of like you</text>
  <text start="1599.66" dur="4.05">know your normal ripples on a lake</text>
  <text start="1601.1" dur="3.57">compared to those big ocean we is coming</text>
  <text start="1603.71" dur="2.55">in mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1604.67" dur="4.38">if all the molecules are doing the same</text>
  <text start="1606.26" dur="4.5">thing at one time all of a sudden the</text>
  <text start="1609.05" dur="5.73">nature of that material starts to change</text>
  <text start="1610.76" dur="7.8">and if you do it better not badly enough</text>
  <text start="1614.78" dur="5.76">that material will fall apart but I just</text>
  <text start="1618.56" dur="6.39">wanted to show you this here&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="1620.54" dur="7.38">example of a Russian physicist talking</text>
  <text start="1624.95" dur="6.27">about how longitudinal electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="1627.92" dur="7.41">waves really do exist and how they fit</text>
  <text start="1631.22" dur="5.7">in with classical physics so you know I</text>
  <text start="1635.33" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t want people in your audience to</text>
  <text start="1636.92" dur="3.78">think I&amp;#39;m a flake this is actually real</text>
  <text start="1638.96" dur="5.58">and there are several papers out there I</text>
  <text start="1640.7" dur="6.98">know I believe you on the math and</text>
  <text start="1644.54" dur="6.36">science side of it I don&amp;#39;t even I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1647.68" dur="6.34">have a look at that no actually I have a</text>
  <text start="1650.9" dur="6.48">video I&amp;#39;d like I&amp;#39;d like to to show and</text>
  <text start="1654.02" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s the video of what what I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="1657.38" dur="3.3">about you&amp;#39;re asking me where does the</text>
  <text start="1658.55" dur="5.88">extra energy come from how in the world</text>
  <text start="1660.68" dur="6.9">could they you know I saw him oh I guess</text>
  <text start="1664.43" dur="4.92">it was a CBS or an NBC special on how</text>
  <text start="1667.58" dur="3.54">this guy the scientist is making the</text>
  <text start="1669.35" dur="4.8">most powerful laser in the world and</text>
  <text start="1671.12" dur="6.87">then you&amp;#39;re looking at all of his wires</text>
  <text start="1674.15" dur="6.15">and fiber optics and his lab is you know</text>
  <text start="1677.99" dur="4.68">everything in there probably weighs 500</text>
  <text start="1680.3" dur="3.78">tons yeah you know that&amp;#39;s like yeah</text>
  <text start="1682.67" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s the most powerful laser in the</text>
  <text start="1684.08" dur="4.17">world there&amp;#39;s another way I was really</text>
  <text start="1686.63" dur="3.36">interested as a kid growing up watching</text>
  <text start="1688.25" dur="3.72">some of the Star Wars movies I always</text>
  <text start="1689.99" dur="3.87">wanted a lightsaber you know yeah</text>
  <text start="1691.97" dur="3.75">liesl tool around the house that would</text>
  <text start="1693.86" dur="3.6">be pretty neat I&amp;#39;ll take apart an old</text>
  <text start="1695.72" dur="5.37">microwave oven and you can actually make</text>
  <text start="1697.46" dur="5.97">one Wow do these modifications that I</text>
  <text start="1701.09" dur="5.31">won&amp;#39;t tell you about yeah well you</text>
  <text start="1703.43" dur="5.16">probably cut it could cut steel that</text>
  <text start="1706.4" dur="4.32">would be so cool I saw someone doing</text>
  <text start="1708.59" dur="3.33">just a sort of a science project one</text>
  <text start="1710.72" dur="3.75">time he was just a guy I worked at</text>
  <text start="1711.92" dur="5.1">RadioShack but he put in mirror sticky</text>
  <text start="1714.47" dur="7.11">tiles on a satellite dish and created oh</text>
  <text start="1717.02" dur="6.51">yes I saw that great fantastic yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="1721.58" dur="5.73">in fact I just took apart a projection</text>
  <text start="1723.53" dur="4.739">TV and I know I can get about six</text>
  <text start="1727.31" dur="2.459">thousand degrees</text>
  <text start="1728.269" dur="3.51">that if I put that Fornell lens in the</text>
  <text start="1729.769" dur="4.5">Sun and I&amp;#39;m gonna get some fire brick</text>
  <text start="1731.779" dur="4.22">and turn that into a glass fusing 4ch</text>
  <text start="1734.269" dur="4.801">Wow</text>
  <text start="1735.999" dur="4.24">for fun yeah but you have to be really</text>
  <text start="1739.07" dur="2.399">careful with those when you&amp;#39;re playing</text>
  <text start="1740.239" dur="3.66">around with them in the sunlight you</text>
  <text start="1741.469" dur="4.41">have to wear welders goggles they have</text>
  <text start="1743.899" dur="4.051">to be really careful about covering them</text>
  <text start="1745.879" dur="4.83">until you&amp;#39;re ready to use them yes you</text>
  <text start="1747.95" dur="6.599">can set things on fire several feet away</text>
  <text start="1750.709" dur="5.481">yeah well I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve thought about some</text>
  <text start="1754.549" dur="4.11">sort of way of using the technology to</text>
  <text start="1756.19" dur="5.409">you know make heating cheaper or</text>
  <text start="1758.659" dur="4.68">something like that but well I want to</text>
  <text start="1761.599" dur="5.43">talk a little bit more about resonance</text>
  <text start="1763.339" dur="5.12">about the wineglass thing um you know</text>
  <text start="1767.029" dur="5.01">there&amp;#39;s another there&amp;#39;s a reason why</text>
  <text start="1768.459" dur="6.1">guitar strings are you know for the</text>
  <text start="1772.039" dur="4.26">lower notes they&amp;#39;re thick and then for</text>
  <text start="1774.559" dur="3.511">the upper notes and they&amp;#39;re wound and</text>
  <text start="1776.299" dur="4.73">then when you get up into the upper</text>
  <text start="1778.07" dur="7.5">higher strings they&amp;#39;re solid steel and</text>
  <text start="1781.029" dur="7.84">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re thinner and basically</text>
  <text start="1785.57" dur="6.719">the body of the guitar is actually made</text>
  <text start="1788.869" dur="7.04">its sizes the sizes of the lower body</text>
  <text start="1792.289" dur="6.42">and the upper body are made to respond</text>
  <text start="1795.909" dur="5.68">resonantly to the entire frequency range</text>
  <text start="1798.709" dur="5.46">of all those strings but each of the</text>
  <text start="1801.589" dur="5.64">individual strings is designed only to</text>
  <text start="1804.169" dur="4.62">vibrate at a certain pitch and it like</text>
  <text start="1807.229" dur="5.88">if you took the upper string of a guitar</text>
  <text start="1808.789" dur="6.901">and tuned it way down it sounds bad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1813.109" dur="5.31">not made to vibrate down at that lower</text>
  <text start="1815.69" dur="5.909">frequency it has to be tuned up to an e</text>
  <text start="1818.419" dur="6.24">or it&amp;#39;s just not going to sound any good</text>
  <text start="1821.599" dur="5.94">so that&amp;#39;s resonance that&amp;#39;s a physical</text>
  <text start="1824.659" dur="5.58">material that is this the right size the</text>
  <text start="1827.539" dur="6.12">right material and the right length to</text>
  <text start="1830.239" dur="7.11">do a specific vibration and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1833.659" dur="9.031">show you water here you know let me see</text>
  <text start="1837.349" dur="9.3">I have to run the show to do this twice</text>
  <text start="1842.69" dur="6.689">now this is the this is just a tank of</text>
  <text start="1846.649" dur="6.84">water and but it&amp;#39;s a long skinny tank</text>
  <text start="1849.379" dur="5.821">and we&amp;#39;re going to talk about where that</text>
  <text start="1853.489" dur="4.32">extra energy and where the extra</text>
  <text start="1855.2" dur="4.919">efficiency comes from to make a weapon</text>
  <text start="1857.809" dur="3.27">that you could mount on a drone that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1860.119" dur="1.951">powerful</text>
  <text start="1861.079" dur="2.881">well the</text>
  <text start="1862.07" dur="5.22">guys gonna send a pulse of water down</text>
  <text start="1863.96" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;ll be a wave and when it gets down</text>
  <text start="1867.29" dur="4.38">here it&amp;#39;s gonna reflect off of this</text>
  <text start="1868.85" dur="4.17">board and reflect back and if you look</text>
  <text start="1871.67" dur="3.42">really carefully you&amp;#39;re gonna see the</text>
  <text start="1873.02" dur="9.09">return reflection it moves really fast</text>
  <text start="1875.09" dur="7.71">going back can you see it it went back</text>
  <text start="1882.11" dur="3.84">already</text>
  <text start="1882.8" dur="6.18">but now so the waves are hitting this</text>
  <text start="1885.95" dur="4.5">board in front and reflecting energy</text>
  <text start="1888.98" dur="5.93">back they have nowhere to go</text>
  <text start="1890.45" dur="7.83">yeah it&amp;#39;s and the uniformity is so eerie</text>
  <text start="1894.91" dur="5.49">it is and it&amp;#39;s partly it&amp;#39;s a function of</text>
  <text start="1898.28" dur="4.53">the distance between the two paddles</text>
  <text start="1900.4" dur="4.81">yeah between that paddle down the end</text>
  <text start="1902.81" dur="4.26">and the wall well you said something</text>
  <text start="1905.21" dur="3.57">like this could be attached to a drone</text>
  <text start="1907.07" dur="5.37">what was the effective range of</text>
  <text start="1908.78" dur="6.03">something like that well that depends a</text>
  <text start="1912.44" dur="5.34">lot on power supply and on what they do</text>
  <text start="1914.81" dur="6.36">with the energy okay now we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="1917.78" dur="5.67">a standing wave and you&amp;#39;ll see why okay</text>
  <text start="1921.17" dur="4.77">if you notice the water seems to just be</text>
  <text start="1923.45" dur="5.64">going up and down mm-hmm there&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1925.94" dur="6.89">there&amp;#39;s almost no sideways moving it</text>
  <text start="1929.09" dur="7.1">yeah it&amp;#39;s dense I&amp;#39;m now imagine this as</text>
  <text start="1932.83" dur="5.65">light energy hitting a piece of metal</text>
  <text start="1936.19" dur="4.42">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen to those molecules</text>
  <text start="1938.48" dur="5.94">in the metal they&amp;#39;re gonna get warmer</text>
  <text start="1940.61" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re gonna get a lot warmer okay now</text>
  <text start="1944.42" dur="4.83">this is just the end of the standing</text>
  <text start="1946.55" dur="4.62">wave there they turned it off so now</text>
  <text start="1949.25" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s gonna degrade and go back out a</text>
  <text start="1951.17" dur="4.74">face yeah I&amp;#39;ve used an ultrasonic</text>
  <text start="1953.72" dur="3.54">cleaner before to make certain types of</text>
  <text start="1955.91" dur="3.21">vitamins and things of that nature and</text>
  <text start="1957.26" dur="5.49">the water gets quite warm from audio</text>
  <text start="1959.12" dur="7.5">waves it&amp;#39;s amazing it really does yeah</text>
  <text start="1962.75" dur="6.39">and and I would imagine that frequency</text>
  <text start="1966.62" dur="4.08">they use in that ultrasonic cleaner the</text>
  <text start="1969.14" dur="3.72">reason they call it ultrasonic is this</text>
  <text start="1970.7" dur="5.04">faster than your ear can hear so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1972.86" dur="6.36">got to be over 20,000 cycles a second so</text>
  <text start="1975.74" dur="7.68">they probably have it as some fraction</text>
  <text start="1979.22" dur="6.84">of the 2.5 4 gigahertz resonance of the</text>
  <text start="1983.42" dur="4.14">water molecules so they can&amp;#39;t they are</text>
  <text start="1986.06" dur="4.44">probably not going to transduce all the</text>
  <text start="1987.56" dur="4.38">way up to 2.5 4 gears I would imagine</text>
  <text start="1990.5" dur="2.8">they&amp;#39;re gonna they could get away with</text>
  <text start="1991.94" dur="3.84">doing half that or</text>
  <text start="1993.3" dur="5.19">a quarter of that and still get</text>
  <text start="1995.78" dur="4.33">significant molecules moving all and</text>
  <text start="1998.49" dur="4.2">trained with each other like this I</text>
  <text start="2000.11" dur="7.5">think it&amp;#39;s point two but I&amp;#39;m a half</text>
  <text start="2002.69" dur="8.4">check point two point two what would</text>
  <text start="2007.61" dur="5.85">that be it you know so my point is that</text>
  <text start="2011.09" dur="4.38">what you&amp;#39;re seeing is water here but</text>
  <text start="2013.46" dur="6.89">what you could also be seeing could be</text>
  <text start="2015.47" dur="8.34">light and you know people are fairly</text>
  <text start="2020.35" dur="6.1">acquainted with what a laser does and a</text>
  <text start="2023.81" dur="5.04">laser does something like this laser is</text>
  <text start="2026.45" dur="4.74">cohesive light it&amp;#39;s not scattered</text>
  <text start="2028.85" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re all aligned all those photons</text>
  <text start="2031.19" dur="3.93">coming are a longer but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2033.14" dur="4.05">something even more to it if you notice</text>
  <text start="2035.12" dur="4.89">when the water first started and came</text>
  <text start="2037.19" dur="7.14">out and then bounced back that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="2040.01" dur="8.399">the real build-up started in those no</text>
  <text start="2044.33" dur="5.88">that is called a standing wave and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2048.409" dur="3.871">gonna stop sharing here for a second</text>
  <text start="2050.21" dur="5.25">because we don&amp;#39;t mean any of those but</text>
  <text start="2052.28" dur="7.889">yeah um what they what they learn to do</text>
  <text start="2055.46" dur="7.02">and this is based on some reverse</text>
  <text start="2060.169" dur="4.701">engineering or something that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2062.48" dur="5.61">need to go into but what they decided</text>
  <text start="2064.87" dur="6.22">from normal radar they decided they</text>
  <text start="2068.09" dur="5.28">could take that return signal and it</text>
  <text start="2071.09" dur="4.05">would when it came back a certain</text>
  <text start="2073.37" dur="4.799">quantity of those are going to come back</text>
  <text start="2075.14" dur="4.92">when the the light pulse goes out a</text>
  <text start="2078.169" dur="5.041">certain amount of that light is going to</text>
  <text start="2080.06" dur="5.94">come back exactly in phase with the</text>
  <text start="2083.21" dur="5.31">initial pulse and they figured out a way</text>
  <text start="2086" dur="6.27">to capture that particular thing with</text>
  <text start="2088.52" dur="7.32">the mirrors and send it into something</text>
  <text start="2092.27" dur="5.85">very much like a laser it&amp;#39;s uh almost</text>
  <text start="2095.84" dur="4.98">done like a lens made out of Corning</text>
  <text start="2098.12" dur="4.83">ware and the original experiments they</text>
  <text start="2100.82" dur="4.2">used Corning ware and then they went to</text>
  <text start="2102.95" dur="5.22">bear him to fight me and the reason they</text>
  <text start="2105.02" dur="5.45">did that is the thing is concave so they</text>
  <text start="2108.17" dur="4.35">would take that energy and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2110.47" dur="4.21">semi-transparent in the microwave range</text>
  <text start="2112.52" dur="4.23">so some of the energy would get</text>
  <text start="2114.68" dur="5.21">reflected back and this is exactly how</text>
  <text start="2116.75" dur="6.57">the laser works only it&amp;#39;s a maser a</text>
  <text start="2119.89" dur="8.16">microwave amplification by stimulated on</text>
  <text start="2123.32" dur="4.73">death ray death ray</text>
  <text start="2128.17" dur="6.81">and so basically we know that they now</text>
  <text start="2131.77" dur="5.46">have the technology not even necessarily</text>
  <text start="2134.98" dur="6.42">that complicated to to play around with</text>
  <text start="2137.23" dur="7.23">wavelengths of you know light and e/m</text>
  <text start="2141.4" dur="5.67">and they can do things well eeehm is</text>
  <text start="2144.46" dur="5.25">actually liked but the part that most</text>
  <text start="2147.07" dur="6.06">physicists even miss because of their</text>
  <text start="2149.71" dur="6.99">training is that there is a there is a</text>
  <text start="2153.13" dur="6.93">much more of a guess interaction with</text>
  <text start="2156.7" dur="5.31">the physical environment then you know</text>
  <text start="2160.06" dur="5.85">they know that they can transmit a wave</text>
  <text start="2162.01" dur="6.45">in a copper coil in an antenna will pick</text>
  <text start="2165.91" dur="4.44">it up and and then they can amplify it</text>
  <text start="2168.46" dur="5.9">and process it and turn it into a radio</text>
  <text start="2170.35" dur="7.5">signal or a TV signal or a phone signal</text>
  <text start="2174.36" dur="5.83">but the part they miss is that there is</text>
  <text start="2177.85" dur="4.02">a physical interaction there can be you</text>
  <text start="2180.19" dur="2.73">know somebody who is up on top of</text>
  <text start="2181.87" dur="3.48">mountain and walks in front of a</text>
  <text start="2182.92" dur="6.45">microwave transmission tower is gonna</text>
  <text start="2185.35" dur="6.48">burn mm-hmm that actually happened it I</text>
  <text start="2189.37" dur="5.4">live in Colorado and that actually</text>
  <text start="2191.83" dur="4.98">happened many many years ago on top of</text>
  <text start="2194.77" dur="4.38">not Falcon which is just about Red Rocks</text>
  <text start="2196.81" dur="4.62">concert venue somebody hiked all the way</text>
  <text start="2199.15" dur="7.26">up there and walked in front of a</text>
  <text start="2201.43" dur="6.59">microwave transmission dish antenna and</text>
  <text start="2206.41" dur="4.2">all too often this is not even</text>
  <text start="2208.02" dur="5.2">necessarily like a death ray which sort</text>
  <text start="2210.61" dur="4.35">of implies focused in one direction it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2213.22" dur="3.27">more often it&amp;#39;s just a turd everywhere</text>
  <text start="2214.96" dur="6.27">around that area it&amp;#39;s just creating a</text>
  <text start="2216.49" dur="5.79">smog yeah well I would call it you know</text>
  <text start="2221.23" dur="2.58">if you&amp;#39;re right in front of a big</text>
  <text start="2222.28" dur="3.99">powerful antenna like that it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="2223.81" dur="5.49">like we&amp;#39;re walking into a undefined&amp;#39;</text>
  <text start="2226.27" dur="5.09">microwave oven it&amp;#39;s you can&amp;#39;t visually</text>
  <text start="2229.3" dur="4.98">define it you know you can&amp;#39;t see it so</text>
  <text start="2231.36" dur="7.99">and that&amp;#39;s the other thing that uh why I</text>
  <text start="2234.28" dur="7.29">think I know that people are sitting</text>
  <text start="2239.35" dur="4.29">they we&amp;#39;re seeing blue lasers and I</text>
  <text start="2241.57" dur="4.05">actually let me share my screen again</text>
  <text start="2243.64" dur="3.36">because again as I understand it blue</text>
  <text start="2245.62" dur="3.6">would not be the laser you&amp;#39;d want to use</text>
  <text start="2247" dur="6.12">anyway to create some sort of a heat</text>
  <text start="2249.22" dur="6.84">effect no absolutely not I believe those</text>
  <text start="2253.12" dur="6.61">are probably targeting beings and and</text>
  <text start="2256.06" dur="6.28">the other part of</text>
  <text start="2259.73" dur="4.74">I want to talk about here is let me see</text>
  <text start="2262.34" dur="3.72">if I can find it I&amp;#39;ll go down and get a</text>
  <text start="2264.47" dur="5.899">picture of that because somebody got got</text>
  <text start="2266.06" dur="6.27">a cellphone picture of one of those yeah</text>
  <text start="2270.369" dur="3.761">here it is I&amp;#39;ve always thought those</text>
  <text start="2272.33" dur="4.65">little handheld lasers were the higher</text>
  <text start="2274.13" dur="5.55">powered ones were fun but at least has</text>
  <text start="2276.98" dur="9.57">like a signal well I guess I got to go</text>
  <text start="2279.68" dur="11.57">through here I&amp;#39;m almost there okay there</text>
  <text start="2286.55" dur="9.24">it is so this is active signaling patent</text>
  <text start="2291.25" dur="7.869">and iGoogle and here&amp;#39;s on the let this</text>
  <text start="2295.79" dur="7.73">from the paradise fire there are</text>
  <text start="2299.119" dur="8.361">pictures of these beams coming down and</text>
  <text start="2303.52" dur="6.91">this is not an exact equivalency</text>
  <text start="2307.48" dur="6.36">basically I do think though what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2310.43" dur="5.58">looking at is probably a targeting beam</text>
  <text start="2313.84" dur="4.66">you know and they would send a laser</text>
  <text start="2316.01" dur="3.93">down and yeah and I&amp;#39;m surprised I think</text>
  <text start="2318.5" dur="3.15">the only reason that looks blue is</text>
  <text start="2319.94" dur="5.69">because it&amp;#39;s usually it would be</text>
  <text start="2321.65" dur="6.69">invisible but the smoke itself is</text>
  <text start="2325.63" dur="5.32">refracting the the light that we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2328.34" dur="4.29">see and filtering it down into something</text>
  <text start="2330.95" dur="3.99">that we can&amp;#39;t see just like with a</text>
  <text start="2332.63" dur="4.83">little laser light you&amp;#39;re playing with a</text>
  <text start="2334.94" dur="5.94">cat or you know on the end of a rifle or</text>
  <text start="2337.46" dur="5.58">something for targeting right you know</text>
  <text start="2340.88" dur="3.479">set those things off if you see it in</text>
  <text start="2343.04" dur="3.81">the spy movies where they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="2344.359" dur="4.561">steal the very high multi-million dollar</text>
  <text start="2346.85" dur="5.13">piece of yeah like Tom Cruise or yeah</text>
  <text start="2348.92" dur="7.14">yeah okay yeah and I can&amp;#39;t see them</text>
  <text start="2351.98" dur="6.66">until they do some vapor of some kind</text>
  <text start="2356.06" dur="5.07">but on the right here is the Google</text>
  <text start="2358.64" dur="6.18">active signaling now you know Google&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2361.13" dur="8.46">into the driverless cars hmm and all</text>
  <text start="2364.82" dur="6.99">kinds of sensing and the reason I put</text>
  <text start="2369.59" dur="6.269">this target in here is that you can see</text>
  <text start="2371.81" dur="8.28">the feedback if you notice they send out</text>
  <text start="2375.859" dur="7.491">a signal and then it goes - it goes out</text>
  <text start="2380.09" dur="5.97">to the to the source technologies and</text>
  <text start="2383.35" dur="5.74">gets if you notice there&amp;#39;s a where the</text>
  <text start="2386.06" dur="5">square is that smallest about the center</text>
  <text start="2389.09" dur="4.16">of our screen here and you can see that</text>
  <text start="2391.06" dur="6.45">the frequency is a job</text>
  <text start="2393.25" dur="6.62">testable and then the thing that</text>
  <text start="2397.51" dur="5.97">disturbs me is the complex conjugate of</text>
  <text start="2399.87" dur="9.43">impulse response analytic signal is</text>
  <text start="2403.48" dur="9.36">propagated so basically it can it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2409.3" dur="7.11">a hardware embedded in a road notes that</text>
  <text start="2412.84" dur="5.73">the car is sitting there mm-hmm and I</text>
  <text start="2416.41" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t know if this happened in your area</text>
  <text start="2418.57" dur="5.94">but a while back no when I was working</text>
  <text start="2420.76" dur="7.49">at D OE I lived in Albuquerque and they</text>
  <text start="2424.51" dur="6.72">were ripping apart streets everywhere</text>
  <text start="2428.25" dur="4.96">just probably within a hundred feet of</text>
  <text start="2431.23" dur="5.67">stoplights and they were embedding</text>
  <text start="2433.21" dur="6.15">sensor strips all over Albuquerque now I</text>
  <text start="2436.9" dur="8.46">think that was part of this project</text>
  <text start="2439.36" dur="10.11">going on so yeah so they can tell</text>
  <text start="2445.36" dur="6.15">whether a car is there but um so one of</text>
  <text start="2449.47" dur="4.26">the other things that I&amp;#39;ve read in all</text>
  <text start="2451.51" dur="6.5">this material that I kept researching is</text>
  <text start="2453.73" dur="6.81">how these microwaves act with asphalt</text>
  <text start="2458.01" dur="5.53">because asphalt actually has a fairly</text>
  <text start="2460.54" dur="5.22">large water component yeah and it melts</text>
  <text start="2463.54" dur="3.99">first right he actually yeah Lord before</text>
  <text start="2465.76" dur="5.04">the plastic in some cases</text>
  <text start="2467.53" dur="4.04">yeah and it&amp;#39;s grounded that&amp;#39;s the other</text>
  <text start="2470.8" dur="3.42">thing</text>
  <text start="2471.57" dur="4.54">the cars and I wanna I kind of want to</text>
  <text start="2474.22" dur="4.1">explain something about why cars do what</text>
  <text start="2476.11" dur="2.21">they do</text>
  <text start="2478.38" dur="6.46">sorry you know and often people will</text>
  <text start="2480.82" dur="6.03">often forget you know it&amp;#39;s not the it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2484.84" dur="3.69">not the jet since cars and the space</text>
  <text start="2486.85" dur="3.87">travel and things like that that come</text>
  <text start="2488.53" dur="4.14">first it&amp;#39;s the weapon systems and the</text>
  <text start="2490.72" dur="5.64">control solving and that&amp;#39;s so disturbing</text>
  <text start="2492.67" dur="7.44">about our culture yeah no I just I have</text>
  <text start="2496.36" dur="5.19">a friend who&amp;#39;s reading Cicero and Cicero</text>
  <text start="2500.11" dur="4.47">is right on the money about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2501.55" dur="5.84">happening right now yeah and he is doing</text>
  <text start="2504.58" dur="4.98">his kids a tremendous service by</text>
  <text start="2507.39" dur="4.06">insisting that they learn about what</text>
  <text start="2509.56" dur="4.56">Cicero had to say about government and</text>
  <text start="2511.45" dur="4.14">culture very interesting well nothing</text>
  <text start="2514.12" dur="4.26">new Under the Sun right we&amp;#39;ve got some</text>
  <text start="2515.59" dur="5.43">new toys but the the incentives haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2518.38" dur="5.7">really changed just the amount of power</text>
  <text start="2521.02" dur="4.71">did you damage have has changed yeah are</text>
  <text start="2524.08" dur="3.23">ours lemons are growing faster than our</text>
  <text start="2525.73" dur="4.37">wits</text>
  <text start="2527.31" dur="5.25">yes there you go yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2530.1" dur="5.82">well what happens when you give you know</text>
  <text start="2532.56" dur="6.03">Amazonian jungle natives who uh you know</text>
  <text start="2535.92" dur="4.29">use poison darts and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="2538.59" dur="4.65">you give him a gun it&amp;#39;s you know what</text>
  <text start="2540.21" dur="5.34">happens yeah but uh someone happens in a</text>
  <text start="2543.24" dur="5.85">car and I was just reading about the</text>
  <text start="2545.55" dur="6.41">that old UFO problem that they had in</text>
  <text start="2549.09" dur="6.45">Texas it was called the cash Landrum um</text>
  <text start="2551.96" dur="7.09">incident where the two women and a boy</text>
  <text start="2555.54" dur="6.81">were on a backcountry road and there was</text>
  <text start="2559.05" dur="5.43">a UFO that came over them and it heated</text>
  <text start="2562.35" dur="4.38">up their car so badly they in fact they</text>
  <text start="2564.48" dur="3.42">ended up with radiation burns and they</text>
  <text start="2566.73" dur="3.12">sued the government and the government</text>
  <text start="2567.9" dur="5.99">said well we don&amp;#39;t have anything like</text>
  <text start="2569.85" dur="8.04">that even though this vehicle was being</text>
  <text start="2573.89" dur="8.47">escorted apparently by 20 helicopters</text>
  <text start="2577.89" dur="6.45">this is a long time ago but those people</text>
  <text start="2582.36" dur="5.37">were they were really injured they were</text>
  <text start="2584.34" dur="7.23">burned and showed signs radiation</text>
  <text start="2587.73" dur="9.45">poisoning anyway so if you think about a</text>
  <text start="2591.57" dur="8.1">car it&amp;#39;s a conductive shell around air</text>
  <text start="2597.18" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s mainly air on the inside of the car</text>
  <text start="2599.67" dur="6.54">mm-hmm with a couple people and a dog</text>
  <text start="2602.91" dur="5.25">and some groceries right but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2606.21" dur="4.53">basically non-conductive on the inside</text>
  <text start="2608.16" dur="4.65">and the outer shell is conductive and</text>
  <text start="2610.74" dur="4.65">the wheels are conductive but the wheels</text>
  <text start="2612.81" dur="7.53">are held up off of the ground by rubber</text>
  <text start="2615.39" dur="8.16">yeah so if this incident inner energy is</text>
  <text start="2620.34" dur="6.21">hitting a car the metal skin of the car</text>
  <text start="2623.55" dur="6.09">is gonna heat up really amazingly and</text>
  <text start="2626.55" dur="5.55">then the cut but the electrical</text>
  <text start="2629.64" dur="5.04">potential of the car is going to act</text>
  <text start="2632.1" dur="5.25">like a capacitor and the whole purpose</text>
  <text start="2634.68" dur="5.25">of the capacitor in electronics is to</text>
  <text start="2637.35" dur="5.67">store charge so the amount of</text>
  <text start="2639.93" dur="5.39">electricity that&amp;#39;s going to build up in</text>
  <text start="2643.02" dur="5.46">the bubble created by the car is</text>
  <text start="2645.32" dur="5.89">tremendous and of course it&amp;#39;s a function</text>
  <text start="2648.48" dur="7.68">of how long the car is being exposed to</text>
  <text start="2651.21" dur="7.77">that energy and so finally when the</text>
  <text start="2656.16" dur="4.98">asphalt around the car starts to melt</text>
  <text start="2658.98" dur="5.28">and you can see in this case it</text>
  <text start="2661.14" dur="6.39">and I&amp;#39;m gonna go back to the beginning</text>
  <text start="2664.26" dur="4.74">of the show here yeah and you can see</text>
  <text start="2667.53" dur="4.769">there&amp;#39;s smoke and stuff but a lot of the</text>
  <text start="2669" dur="6.059">plastic is not even melted yeah here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2672.299" dur="4.77">an example and you know that this is</text>
  <text start="2675.059" dur="3.121">what clued people into the fact that</text>
  <text start="2677.069" dur="3.48">this is a different kind of weapon</text>
  <text start="2678.18" dur="4.53">because the trees around the green and</text>
  <text start="2680.549" dur="6.02">the grapevines are fine and then look at</text>
  <text start="2682.71" dur="6.81">this car yeah and I was looking up the</text>
  <text start="2686.569" dur="5.651">temperatures that are at at the</text>
  <text start="2689.52" dur="4.559">forefront of a fire line in a forest</text>
  <text start="2692.22" dur="6.119">fire and they do get up to around 1400</text>
  <text start="2694.079" dur="6.51">degrees mm-hmm so you can see that in a</text>
  <text start="2698.339" dur="5.071">forest fire alloy wheels would</text>
  <text start="2700.589" dur="5.28">definitely melt they could melt under</text>
  <text start="2703.41" dur="5.28">normal conditions however there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2705.869" dur="5.43">forest fire around this car yeah and the</text>
  <text start="2708.69" dur="5.54">body is you know in the bodies and look</text>
  <text start="2711.299" dur="6.871">at the windshield when shields are are</text>
  <text start="2714.23" dur="7.75">laminated glass and soda lime glass and</text>
  <text start="2718.17" dur="6.659">after they&amp;#39;re done menuing them they</text>
  <text start="2721.98" dur="5.91">tempered them if he&amp;#39;s the melting point</text>
  <text start="2724.829" dur="4.831">goes up above 2200 degrees through a</text>
  <text start="2727.89" dur="6.36">windshield so that would not be</text>
  <text start="2729.66" dur="6.389">explained by a forest fire no no and in</text>
  <text start="2734.25" dur="4.95">the very fact that everything around all</text>
  <text start="2736.049" dur="5.07">the vegetation is green shows that some</text>
  <text start="2739.2" dur="6.29">other factor was at work beside just a</text>
  <text start="2741.119" dur="4.371">forest fire yeah burned</text>
  <text start="2745.859" dur="4.44">I had heard 1244 aluminum I hadn&amp;#39;t heard</text>
  <text start="2748.589" dur="4.051">on your chart here it says all the way</text>
  <text start="2750.299" dur="6.331">down to 865 I didn&amp;#39;t yeah that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2752.64" dur="7.139">alloy such a wide spectrum cowboy okay</text>
  <text start="2756.63" dur="5.76">yeah so you know but I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="2759.779" dur="4.26">anything else burned around there so it</text>
  <text start="2762.39" dur="2.52">wasn&amp;#39;t a forest fire that did this to</text>
  <text start="2764.039" dur="3.421">this vehicle</text>
  <text start="2764.91" dur="5.939">and here&amp;#39;s the part where I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2767.46" dur="6">the kids to hear it because I got to</text>
  <text start="2770.849" dur="5.76">thinking hard about this and you know</text>
  <text start="2773.46" dur="5.79">seat springs in a car are you know</text>
  <text start="2776.609" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;re usually coils or they&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="2779.25" dur="6.89">an S sort of a turn in in like a you</text>
  <text start="2783.779" dur="5.371">know high tensile strength steel</text>
  <text start="2786.14" dur="5.199">seat Springs and I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2789.15" dur="4.29">looked at the videos for on a plain</text>
  <text start="2791.339" dur="4.49">truth Channel</text>
  <text start="2793.44" dur="5.399">um I don&amp;#39;t always agree with his</text>
  <text start="2795.829" dur="5.051">conclusions on things but he&amp;#39;s done some</text>
  <text start="2798.839" dur="4.411">good research and he actually went out</text>
  <text start="2800.88" dur="4.59">and talked to people that were some of</text>
  <text start="2803.25" dur="5.19">the first on the scene in Paradise and</text>
  <text start="2805.47" dur="5.76">the reason they weren&amp;#39;t finding people</text>
  <text start="2808.44" dur="6.84">is that they were literally at the foot</text>
  <text start="2811.23" dur="5.94">well of the car they were in Malay to</text>
  <text start="2815.28" dur="5.549">the point where they were nothing but</text>
  <text start="2817.17" dur="6.449">ash and bone fragments and I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="2820.829" dur="7.5">the reason is that the seat springs were</text>
  <text start="2823.619" dur="6.511">literally reacting electrically to the</text>
  <text start="2828.329" dur="3.691">signal that was being being down at</text>
  <text start="2830.13" dur="3.449">these cars I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;d see</text>
  <text start="2832.02" dur="3.54">sparks but you&amp;#39;d certainly see a lot of</text>
  <text start="2833.579" dur="4.921">interesting reactions with metals and</text>
  <text start="2835.56" dur="5.46">something like this yeah well this is</text>
  <text start="2838.5" dur="5.28">you would also see trees you know things</text>
  <text start="2841.02" dur="3.99">that are I&amp;#39;ll go back to that in</text>
  <text start="2843.78" dur="3.12">anything with water or anything</text>
  <text start="2845.01" dur="7.559">conductive thing with water let&amp;#39;s look</text>
  <text start="2846.9" dur="7.41">at something that has water you know and</text>
  <text start="2852.569" dur="5.221">I know that sometimes trees are rotted</text>
  <text start="2854.31" dur="6.48">out in the core and I get that but no in</text>
  <text start="2857.79" dur="7.02">this case um why would the bark not be</text>
  <text start="2860.79" dur="6.75">burning no it&amp;#39;s because in the water is</text>
  <text start="2864.81" dur="6.93">overexcited inside the tree like a</text>
  <text start="2867.54" dur="6.09">microwave oven would do so anyway I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2871.74" dur="3.599">thinking um the people that were first</text>
  <text start="2873.63" dur="5.85">some of the first people returning back</text>
  <text start="2875.339" dur="5.791">to paradise we&amp;#39;re saying that the</text>
  <text start="2879.48" dur="3.619">estimates of the number of people that</text>
  <text start="2881.13" dur="5.55">died are astounding</text>
  <text start="2883.099" dur="6.121">they&amp;#39;re just the guy from a plain truth</text>
  <text start="2886.68" dur="5.159">was thinking maybe fifty thousand people</text>
  <text start="2889.22" dur="4.93">and this is you know if you&amp;#39;re following</text>
  <text start="2891.839" dur="5.03">the cue theory then this is all for</text>
  <text start="2894.15" dur="5.49">politics this is all for politics I</text>
  <text start="2896.869" dur="5.821">think it&amp;#39;s much bigger than politics</text>
  <text start="2899.64" dur="5.88">actually I&amp;#39;m starting to think that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2902.69" dur="5.169">domination of the human species yeah</text>
  <text start="2905.52" dur="5.4">yeah there&amp;#39;s about there&amp;#39;s very bad guys</text>
  <text start="2907.859" dur="4.411">in positions of power and yeah have you</text>
  <text start="2910.92" dur="4.89">ever had the feeling that you&amp;#39;re a farm</text>
  <text start="2912.27" dur="5.309">animal I have there&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text>
  <text start="2915.81" dur="3.66">Orwell in it right there&amp;#39;s the yeah</text>
  <text start="2917.579" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re supposed to we&amp;#39;re supposed to just</text>
  <text start="2919.47" dur="4.26">go along to be slaughtered and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2922.56" dur="4.009">amazing to the extent that people</text>
  <text start="2923.73" dur="5.94">actually do often end up doing</text>
  <text start="2926.569" dur="5.651">I&amp;#39;m more of an alien type honestly you</text>
  <text start="2929.67" dur="4.949">know I&amp;#39;m a full ruff party an</text>
  <text start="2932.22" dur="4.05">anarcho-capitalist voluntarios I want no</text>
  <text start="2934.619" dur="4.351">part of anything to do with the</text>
  <text start="2936.27" dur="4.11">government or or force over any other</text>
  <text start="2938.97" dur="3.99">person I don&amp;#39;t want to control anyone</text>
  <text start="2940.38" dur="4.92">and I don&amp;#39;t want anyone control me I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2942.96" dur="4.8">make the point that you know I sent you</text>
  <text start="2945.3" dur="5.039">my resume and and everything that I have</text>
  <text start="2947.76" dur="6.299">tried to do in my life from non-invasive</text>
  <text start="2950.339" dur="5.881">medical monitors to designing training</text>
  <text start="2954.059" dur="9.421">for radiological emergency responders</text>
  <text start="2956.22" dur="10.56">it&amp;#39;s always been on the healing end that</text>
  <text start="2963.48" dur="5.19">I do not I was a contractor for do-e and</text>
  <text start="2966.78" dur="6.569">I&amp;#39;m really glad I wasn&amp;#39;t a lifer</text>
  <text start="2968.67" dur="6.389">employee but it I paid a price for my</text>
  <text start="2973.349" dur="4.531">ability to understand technical things</text>
  <text start="2975.059" dur="5.191">and to ask questions and I won&amp;#39;t go into</text>
  <text start="2977.88" dur="4.979">it but I paid a heck of a price I should</text>
  <text start="2980.25" dur="5.04">have died and there were times when I</text>
  <text start="2982.859" dur="4.921">wish I had do to some incidents that</text>
  <text start="2985.29" dur="4.47">occurred yeah and in your past you</text>
  <text start="2987.78" dur="3.75">actually held a queue clearance which is</text>
  <text start="2989.76" dur="5.069">a very fascinating for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2991.53" dur="5.43">yeah I I had to it was required for my</text>
  <text start="2994.829" dur="5.461">job because one of the things about</text>
  <text start="2996.96" dur="6.75">Emergency Operations is that those plans</text>
  <text start="3000.29" dur="5.4">have to be classified or if the enemy</text>
  <text start="3003.71" dur="5.97">when whoever the enemy is whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3005.69" dur="6.09">terrorists or who knows another country</text>
  <text start="3009.68" dur="3.83">or whatever would get a hold of those</text>
  <text start="3011.78" dur="5.279">plans then they would be able to</text>
  <text start="3013.51" dur="5.26">proactively destroy an emergency</text>
  <text start="3017.059" dur="3.331">response and then they&amp;#39;ve accomplished</text>
  <text start="3018.77" dur="6.809">the same goal that originally had which</text>
  <text start="3020.39" dur="7.04">is to kill everybody so you know so um</text>
  <text start="3025.579" dur="4.881">yeah it&amp;#39;s not the kind of work that</text>
  <text start="3027.43" dur="6.79">enables very much sleep at night</text>
  <text start="3030.46" dur="5.349">especially when well I have the ability</text>
  <text start="3034.22" dur="4.17">to read and understand technical</text>
  <text start="3035.809" dur="4.981">material and the other thing I do is I</text>
  <text start="3038.39" dur="6.659">correlate and what I&amp;#39;m correlating now</text>
  <text start="3040.79" dur="7.41">is that microwave standing wave see the</text>
  <text start="3045.049" dur="5.871">difference between radar and what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3048.2" dur="6.06">dealing with now is number one radar</text>
  <text start="3050.92" dur="5.889">doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;ll get that echo back that</text>
  <text start="3054.26" dur="5.91">reflection back and process it and say</text>
  <text start="3056.809" dur="5.101">oh it&amp;#39;s over there but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3060.17" dur="3.33">oh I&amp;#39;m gonna feedback and build up and</text>
  <text start="3061.91" dur="4.32">build up and build up and create this</text>
  <text start="3063.5" dur="6.9">beam that&amp;#39;s gonna lock onto a car and</text>
  <text start="3066.23" dur="6.089">melt it and vaporize the inhabitants you</text>
  <text start="3070.4" dur="4.14">know it doesn&amp;#39;t do that is there</text>
  <text start="3072.319" dur="4.081">anything that people could do to protect</text>
  <text start="3074.54" dur="4.829">themselves other than having some sort</text>
  <text start="3076.4" dur="6">of massive Faraday cage that&amp;#39;s on some</text>
  <text start="3079.369" dur="6.48">sort of overcharging work because</text>
  <text start="3082.4" dur="5.719">there&amp;#39;s a mechanistic aspect to this in</text>
  <text start="3085.849" dur="5.581">fact the standing wave in this</text>
  <text start="3088.119" dur="7.541">application is called a solid time it</text>
  <text start="3091.43" dur="8.06">actually is almost a palpable thing um</text>
  <text start="3095.66" dur="9.419">if you can think of it&amp;#39;s kind of like um</text>
  <text start="3099.49" dur="9.16">imagine um well a lightning strike every</text>
  <text start="3105.079" dur="6.24">uh millisecond or every nanosecond</text>
  <text start="3108.65" dur="6.209">having a full-fledged lightning strike</text>
  <text start="3111.319" dur="5.161">hitting one spot every nanosec so</text>
  <text start="3114.859" dur="4.98">there&amp;#39;s no way it cool that faster than</text>
  <text start="3116.48" dur="5.099">it heats no now the only the only thing</text>
  <text start="3119.839" dur="4.291">we can do well I&amp;#39;ve got some suggestions</text>
  <text start="3121.579" dur="5.551">and that&amp;#39;s the productive part of our</text>
  <text start="3124.13" dur="5.37">interview I think and I really think</text>
  <text start="3127.13" dur="4.26">that you know we are a community that is</text>
  <text start="3129.5" dur="4.26">waking up and we all have our different</text>
  <text start="3131.39" dur="5.04">strengths and I&amp;#39;m not asking everybody</text>
  <text start="3133.76" dur="4.349">to understand the science but I am</text>
  <text start="3136.43" dur="4.29">asking people to be conscious of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3138.109" dur="4.74">going on yeah and we all have to deal</text>
  <text start="3140.72" dur="5.22">with in our in our own way according to</text>
  <text start="3142.849" dur="6.331">our own strengths and your strengths is</text>
  <text start="3145.94" dur="6.3">your channel that&amp;#39;s one of them and your</text>
  <text start="3149.18" dur="4.8">voluntary ISM I think and my strength is</text>
  <text start="3152.24" dur="5.43">under being able to understand correlate</text>
  <text start="3153.98" dur="5.91">different technical materials but and as</text>
  <text start="3157.67" dur="3.84">I said if you do not understand if you</text>
  <text start="3159.89" dur="3.78">want to just brush it off and call it a</text>
  <text start="3161.51" dur="4.849">laser then you&amp;#39;re missing some of the</text>
  <text start="3163.67" dur="5.159">most important factors because</text>
  <text start="3166.359" dur="6.611">regardless of whatever frequency a laser</text>
  <text start="3168.829" dur="5.79">is you can reflect it you cannot reflect</text>
  <text start="3172.97" dur="5.16">this this could get you underground</text>
  <text start="3174.619" dur="6.031">right like even if your see yeah this</text>
  <text start="3178.13" dur="6.36">disc antenna trait well based on what I</text>
  <text start="3180.65" dur="6.99">know about HAARP technology in the first</text>
  <text start="3184.49" dur="6.079">Gulf War they did a HAARP experiment I</text>
  <text start="3187.64" dur="6.2">have the documentation on this and they</text>
  <text start="3190.569" dur="6.091">focused on a bunker</text>
  <text start="3193.84" dur="6.42">and the bunker was eight stories deep in</text>
  <text start="3196.66" dur="8.01">the desert and they were capable of</text>
  <text start="3200.26" dur="6.96">imaging that bunker and the story about</text>
  <text start="3204.67" dur="4.58">the bunker is that the soldiers came</text>
  <text start="3207.22" dur="5.4">screaming up out of that underground</text>
  <text start="3209.25" dur="5.44">bunker through down the right pulls in</text>
  <text start="3212.62" dur="4.86">bother heads men on their knees and</text>
  <text start="3214.69" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re asking Allah to forgive them and</text>
  <text start="3217.48" dur="6.93">to take them because whatever they</text>
  <text start="3220.15" dur="6.9">inexperienced had to be horrible wow</text>
  <text start="3224.41" dur="4.23">that was interesting and we were told to</text>
  <text start="3227.05" dur="5.79">believe that it was all done by a guy in</text>
  <text start="3228.64" dur="6.96">a cave yeah well that was us doing</text>
  <text start="3232.84" dur="4.8">something to them and using them as lab</text>
  <text start="3235.6" dur="4.59">rats because we surely wouldn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="3237.64" dur="4.23">do to our own guys right I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="3240.19" dur="3.15">they care honestly at this level I think</text>
  <text start="3241.87" dur="3.81">that they would be willing to they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3243.34" dur="5.19">done it some of the MKULTRA stuff was</text>
  <text start="3245.68" dur="4.95">done to children they&amp;#39;ve done yeah brain</text>
  <text start="3248.53" dur="6.59">surgeries to dogs that&amp;#39;s nice an</text>
  <text start="3250.63" dur="8.58">awakening for me to understand how truly</text>
  <text start="3255.12" dur="7.09">amoral it is there is no sense of ethics</text>
  <text start="3259.21" dur="6.57">or morals or or and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3262.21" dur="5.43">compassion or caring for humanity at all</text>
  <text start="3265.78" dur="4.2">people don&amp;#39;t want to believe that there</text>
  <text start="3267.64" dur="4.02">are people devoid of emotion and empathy</text>
  <text start="3269.98" dur="3.78">you know psychopathic just a small</text>
  <text start="3271.66" dur="4.08">percentage right I&amp;#39;m but they exist and</text>
  <text start="3273.76" dur="3.15">they fend groups to work together and</text>
  <text start="3275.74" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s the problem we&amp;#39;re dealing a lot</text>
  <text start="3276.91" dur="6.81">of them work in government yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3278.95" dur="7.56">attractive to them that&amp;#39;s true yeah and</text>
  <text start="3283.72" dur="5.07">you can&amp;#39;t you can&amp;#39;t give a position of</text>
  <text start="3286.51" dur="3.96">power and influence and prestige and</text>
  <text start="3288.79" dur="5.07">then not expect a psychopath to show up</text>
  <text start="3290.47" dur="5.52">to it well in speaking of that I this is</text>
  <text start="3293.86" dur="4.68">one of my areas that I&amp;#39;m not strong and</text>
  <text start="3295.99" dur="4.38">uh and that some people are like I I</text>
  <text start="3298.54" dur="4.26">tried to contact Deborah to virus</text>
  <text start="3300.37" dur="5.4">because they got the science all wrong</text>
  <text start="3302.8" dur="6.26">but they they are correct in the need to</text>
  <text start="3305.77" dur="5.85">organize and the need to monitor things</text>
  <text start="3309.06" dur="4.45">for one of the one of the things that</text>
  <text start="3311.62" dur="4.83">people who have a different strength</text>
  <text start="3313.51" dur="6.17">area than I do they could monitor zoning</text>
  <text start="3316.45" dur="6.33">changes for instance mm-hmm if you watch</text>
  <text start="3319.68" dur="5.77">say a developers trying to buy up a</text>
  <text start="3322.78" dur="3.54">bunch properties and or small or a</text>
  <text start="3325.45" dur="2.58">government elite</text>
  <text start="3326.32" dur="5.82">he is condemning a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="3328.03" dur="7.26">properties it&amp;#39;s time to ask why and I</text>
  <text start="3332.14" dur="5.4">out there in paradise apparently some</text>
  <text start="3335.29" dur="6.39">some of those properties were on in the</text>
  <text start="3337.54" dur="6.21">way of the high-speed rail I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3341.68" dur="3.6">how accurate I am in saying that but</text>
  <text start="3343.75" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s the theory I&amp;#39;ve heard is that</text>
  <text start="3345.28" dur="8.91">yeah to burn those folks out so that</text>
  <text start="3348.31" dur="7.53">they could possess the property I feel</text>
  <text start="3354.19" dur="3.06">like it&amp;#39;s a tertiary effect you know</text>
  <text start="3355.84" dur="2.7">they&amp;#39;ve got a lot of different benefits</text>
  <text start="3357.25" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re gonna get out of it but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3358.54" dur="2.76">well and the other you have to look at</text>
  <text start="3360.52" dur="3.06">that area</text>
  <text start="3361.3" dur="4.86">those are roads those people wanted to</text>
  <text start="3363.58" dur="4.92">live off the grid right and they were</text>
  <text start="3366.16" dur="4.23">trying to make their own way and they</text>
  <text start="3368.5" dur="3.84">also though they made some bad mistakes</text>
  <text start="3370.39" dur="3.36">they did not have defensible space</text>
  <text start="3372.34" dur="3.57">around their properties</text>
  <text start="3373.75" dur="4.08">I noticed the holes in the trees where</text>
  <text start="3375.91" dur="4.29">the houses used to be even though all</text>
  <text start="3377.83" dur="4.02">the trees around them were green those</text>
  <text start="3380.2" dur="3.75">you know you could look straight down</text>
  <text start="3381.85" dur="4.5">from the in the drone footage and see</text>
  <text start="3383.95" dur="4.68">her a hole a rectangular hole in the</text>
  <text start="3386.35" dur="5.22">trees meaning that the trees came right</text>
  <text start="3388.63" dur="6.66">up to the cabin and using using these</text>
  <text start="3391.57" dur="6.69">you know how tempting is it to have the</text>
  <text start="3395.29" dur="6.47">power to vaporize someone instantly</text>
  <text start="3398.26" dur="6.75">where there&amp;#39;s no evidence left you know</text>
  <text start="3401.76" dur="6.73">there&amp;#39;s no yeah I don&amp;#39;t even know what</text>
  <text start="3405.01" dur="5.73">yeah if a plain truth is correct about</text>
  <text start="3408.49" dur="5.28">the numbers well you know look at what</text>
  <text start="3410.74" dur="6.42">happened in Santa Rosa those people the</text>
  <text start="3413.77" dur="5.25">people who survived we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="3417.16" dur="4.74">recover their properties and the</text>
  <text start="3419.02" dur="6.69">insurance companies just walked it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3421.9" dur="5.94">perfect alibi oh it&amp;#39;s an act of God we</text>
  <text start="3425.71" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t have to pay so they couldn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="3427.84" dur="4.53">any insurance settlements they have</text>
  <text start="3429.79" dur="5.01">nothing but white fine ash which is not</text>
  <text start="3432.37" dur="4.41">how a normal house fire is you know</text>
  <text start="3434.8" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s usually blackened Timbers and</text>
  <text start="3436.78" dur="5.34">pieces of metal there was nothing left</text>
  <text start="3439.12" dur="4.53">in these burn scars yeah and so people</text>
  <text start="3442.12" dur="3.57">would be out there camping and then</text>
  <text start="3443.65" dur="4.14">Santa Rosa apparently passed an</text>
  <text start="3445.69" dur="5.13">ordinance in our ordinance that people</text>
  <text start="3447.79" dur="6.39">are not allowed to camp on their</text>
  <text start="3450.82" dur="4.56">property yeah and they really don&amp;#39;t own</text>
  <text start="3454.18" dur="5.01">their property they&amp;#39;re being kicked off</text>
  <text start="3455.38" dur="4.8">by the town government yeah I know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3459.19" dur="3.03">actually had a</text>
  <text start="3460.18" dur="4.08">journey to try to find the place in the</text>
  <text start="3462.22" dur="4.29">country to go and just be free and be</text>
  <text start="3464.26" dur="4.5">left alone to build my own thing into my</text>
  <text start="3466.51" dur="5.19">own my own structure my own home my own</text>
  <text start="3468.76" dur="5.339">kind of homestead is not easy it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3471.7" dur="4.74">easy to find freedom well I have a</text>
  <text start="3474.099" dur="5.851">couple ideas that I wanted to talk about</text>
  <text start="3476.44" dur="5.7">now the reality of a situation like this</text>
  <text start="3479.95" dur="3.72">we don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s doing it I can tell</text>
  <text start="3482.14" dur="4.53">you who did the patents but I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3483.67" dur="4.86">who is using those patents mm-hmm and oh</text>
  <text start="3486.67" dur="3.81">by the way some of the patent materials</text>
  <text start="3488.53" dur="5.339">that I looked at actually are involved</text>
  <text start="3490.48" dur="6.66">in cloaking yeah I&amp;#39;ve seen some of the</text>
  <text start="3493.869" dur="5.521">smaller more personal technologies where</text>
  <text start="3497.14" dur="3.87">they have little cameras that cast that</text>
  <text start="3499.39" dur="3.84">what you see on the other side of you</text>
  <text start="3501.01" dur="4.65">and and you can Saran cloaked as a</text>
  <text start="3503.23" dur="4.2">person that&amp;#39;s really neat yeah well the</text>
  <text start="3505.66" dur="4.5">stealth technology uses a lot of the</text>
  <text start="3507.43" dur="5.97">same feedback mechanisms that are used</text>
  <text start="3510.16" dur="8.669">in this technology right on so I you</text>
  <text start="3513.4" dur="9.39">know I live right well about 300 feet</text>
  <text start="3518.829" dur="7.681">from me is the Rio Grande National</text>
  <text start="3522.79" dur="6.329">Forest and this town has been evacuated</text>
  <text start="3526.51" dur="5.43">and I think let&amp;#39;s see about four years</text>
  <text start="3529.119" dur="4.891">ago there was a fire that came so close</text>
  <text start="3531.94" dur="4.47">they had to evacuate the town which is a</text>
  <text start="3534.01" dur="5.75">big deal with summer in Colorado this</text>
  <text start="3536.41" dur="8.31">town depends on that money yeah</text>
  <text start="3539.76" dur="7.27">so I also I owned some acreage that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3544.72" dur="6.149">much further out and because I&amp;#39;m older</text>
  <text start="3547.03" dur="5.819">now I live closer into town but I do</text>
  <text start="3550.869" dur="4.831">keep that property as a fallback place</text>
  <text start="3552.849" dur="5.551">and it&amp;#39;s much sparser in terms of trees</text>
  <text start="3555.7" dur="5.04">out that way and it&amp;#39;s unlikely than any</text>
  <text start="3558.4" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;ve tried to do controlled burns out</text>
  <text start="3560.74" dur="5.609">there without success there&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="3563.29" dur="6.569">enough to sustain no no no to sustain</text>
  <text start="3566.349" dur="5.871">but um in terms of what people can do I</text>
  <text start="3569.859" dur="4.791">I&amp;#39;m gonna bring up my powerpoint again I</text>
  <text start="3572.22" dur="5.23">wanted to show you a few things that</text>
  <text start="3574.65" dur="6.04">since the I used to work on Kirtland Air</text>
  <text start="3577.45" dur="5.97">Force Base and quite often they&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="3580.69" dur="5.369">doing training and there would be plumes</text>
  <text start="3583.42" dur="5.07">of smoke or something coming across the</text>
  <text start="3586.059" dur="5.49">only Road that I had to get in and out</text>
  <text start="3588.49" dur="5.19">of the base yeah and I didn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="3591.549" dur="5.3">was in that smoke so</text>
  <text start="3593.68" dur="6.54">at that time I got a timing suit and I</text>
  <text start="3596.849" dur="6.131">started carrying yeah it&amp;#39;s really gas</text>
  <text start="3600.22" dur="5.19">mask yeah I don&amp;#39;t blame you and the</text>
  <text start="3602.98" dur="5.46">problem with the gas mask though in a</text>
  <text start="3605.41" dur="5.22">fire situation it&amp;#39;s a good idea because</text>
  <text start="3608.44" dur="3.869">your eyes are protected so you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3610.63" dur="4.17">gonna you know be blinded by the smoke</text>
  <text start="3612.309" dur="6.03">but a gas mask cannot give you oxygen</text>
  <text start="3614.8" dur="6.269">and that the one guy out</text>
  <text start="3618.339" dur="6.331">otay I think his name was um who</text>
  <text start="3621.069" dur="6.391">survived and made it out yeah there were</text>
  <text start="3624.67" dur="4.909">several reasons it&amp;#39;s why he lucked out</text>
  <text start="3627.46" dur="4.879">but there were several reasons why I</text>
  <text start="3629.579" dur="5.711">think the technical reasons why he lived</text>
  <text start="3632.339" dur="6.071">but um another thing that I carry with</text>
  <text start="3635.29" dur="6.39">me in my see this is the to me this is a</text>
  <text start="3638.41" dur="6.27">redefined bug out bag yeah it&amp;#39;s got a</text>
  <text start="3641.68" dur="6.419">few other things I carry this stuff this</text>
  <text start="3644.68" dur="6.51">is oxygen oh yeah yeah of course</text>
  <text start="3648.099" dur="5.341">just a lot of boost I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3651.19" dur="4.08">enough to keep you going in a low if you</text>
  <text start="3653.44" dur="4.44">know if you&amp;#39;re in a forest fire there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3655.27" dur="6.24">nowhere yeah you think reading but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3657.88" dur="8.01">not air it&amp;#39;s not oxygen and then the</text>
  <text start="3661.51" dur="6">other thing I have is I wash the other</text>
  <text start="3665.89" dur="2.76">thing I have and there are plenty of</text>
  <text start="3667.51" dur="3.539">other alternatives</text>
  <text start="3668.65" dur="3.659">yeah the smoke can blind you so oh yeah</text>
  <text start="3671.049" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;m really interested in learning about</text>
  <text start="3672.309" dur="4.921">you know ways to protect ourselves from</text>
  <text start="3674.109" dur="5.611">from this kind of technology if it</text>
  <text start="3677.23" dur="4.71">exists but also from five games are some</text>
  <text start="3679.72" dur="4.139">things but they&amp;#39;re very expensive and I</text>
  <text start="3681.94" dur="3.33">have looked into them and I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="3683.859" dur="5.881">about a few of them but the other thing</text>
  <text start="3685.27" dur="8.49">I carry with me is it&amp;#39;s a blanket right</text>
  <text start="3689.74" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s very heavy aramid blanket this is a</text>
  <text start="3693.76" dur="4.589">fireproof blanket because I have a cat</text>
  <text start="3696.19" dur="4.29">and I keep his carrier nearby and if</text>
  <text start="3698.349" dur="4.591">this anything happens like a fire here</text>
  <text start="3700.48" dur="4.43">I&amp;#39;m gonna get my cat in his carrier and</text>
  <text start="3702.94" dur="4.169">then I&amp;#39;ll be able to cover me and him</text>
  <text start="3704.91" dur="4.09">but the one thing people should not</text>
  <text start="3707.109" dur="5.7">count on is that they&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="3709" dur="8.73">able to stay in their vehicles yeah long</text>
  <text start="3712.809" dur="6.571">time yeah so they really have to think</text>
  <text start="3717.73" dur="4.619">about this it&amp;#39;s a whole different way of</text>
  <text start="3719.38" dur="4.83">thinking you know I I used to think</text>
  <text start="3722.349" dur="4.46">about bugging out and having an extra</text>
  <text start="3724.21" dur="4.579">you know five gallon can again</text>
  <text start="3726.809" dur="4.02">you know I have my second my secondary</text>
  <text start="3728.789" dur="5.91">route plotted and all that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="3730.829" dur="5.7">and when you&amp;#39;re dealing with this</text>
  <text start="3734.699" dur="5.04">technology you have to get out of the</text>
  <text start="3736.529" dur="5.4">vehicle you want to live and so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3739.739" dur="4.83">all the hazards in a forest fire without</text>
  <text start="3741.929" dur="4.711">any other protection you know and by the</text>
  <text start="3744.569" dur="3.93">way you know people think oh well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3746.64" dur="4.229">gonna buy one of those firefighter suits</text>
  <text start="3748.499" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s all reflective remember what I</text>
  <text start="3750.869" dur="5.73">was reading about aluminum vaporizing in</text>
  <text start="3753.209" dur="5.31">this technology not a good idea to buy</text>
  <text start="3756.599" dur="4.291">one of those shiny reflective suits cuz</text>
  <text start="3758.519" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s gonna vaporize on you yeah that</text>
  <text start="3760.89" dur="5.849">would be very painful economic cotton</text>
  <text start="3763.469" dur="5.46">would be much better what can we do -</text>
  <text start="3766.739" dur="3.901">are there any options maybe for 5g</text>
  <text start="3768.929" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s another really bad situation that</text>
  <text start="3770.64" dur="3.869">is gonna just be a sort of a gradual</text>
  <text start="3772.499" dur="4.85">that we all deal with there definitely</text>
  <text start="3774.509" dur="6.391">are and I&amp;#39;ve been doing some research</text>
  <text start="3777.349" dur="5.17">you know the thing about radar the thing</text>
  <text start="3780.9" dur="3.539">that disturbs me is that what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3782.519" dur="5.19">talking about is way more than radar</text>
  <text start="3784.439" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s not only is it not the sine wave</text>
  <text start="3787.709" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s the sawtooth wave it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="3790.589" dur="6.811">standing wave so it&amp;#39;s very sharp peaks</text>
  <text start="3793.829" dur="5.73">at very strong signal and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3797.4" dur="5.369">like protecting yourself from normal</text>
  <text start="3799.559" dur="5.97">radar there&amp;#39;s no suit you can put on to</text>
  <text start="3802.769" dur="5.371">protect yourself from radar but this is</text>
  <text start="3805.529" dur="5.79">even worse than radar this is way more</text>
  <text start="3808.14" dur="6.599">powerful and way more destructive you</text>
  <text start="3811.319" dur="6.9">know so I think the the best thing is</text>
  <text start="3814.739" dur="5.641">avoidance mm-hmm and I&amp;#39;m gonna bring</text>
  <text start="3818.219" dur="4.681">that PowerPoint back and because I</text>
  <text start="3820.38" dur="6.54">always I need reminders or something to</text>
  <text start="3822.9" dur="8.339">you know mine is there no shielding that</text>
  <text start="3826.92" dur="7.559">works with things like 5g that yes there</text>
  <text start="3831.239" dur="5.161">are some no um okay there are some</text>
  <text start="3834.479" dur="3.36">shielding materials that work for 5g</text>
  <text start="3836.4" dur="3.99">because you have to keep in mind that</text>
  <text start="3837.839" dur="6.72">the fifth generation doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="3840.39" dur="9.299">specify a frequency our our cellphones</text>
  <text start="3844.559" dur="8.21">now use around 2.5 gigahertz and 5g is</text>
  <text start="3849.689" dur="6.18">5th generation it&amp;#39;s not the 5 gigahertz</text>
  <text start="3852.769" dur="5.53">it&amp;#39;s not necessarily 5 gigahertz they</text>
  <text start="3855.869" dur="8.73">haven&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="3858.299" dur="7.47">hardly no I can&amp;#39;t imagine that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3864.599" dur="4.531">think they&amp;#39;re gonna be using five</text>
  <text start="3865.769" dur="6.54">gigahertz transmission mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="3869.13" dur="6.119">they may eventually do that and it is</text>
  <text start="3872.309" dur="4.831">higher in frequency and the thing about</text>
  <text start="3875.249" dur="5.46">higher frequencies is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3877.14" dur="4.829">easier they carry less energy and a 5g</text>
  <text start="3880.709" dur="2.79">signal is not going to have that</text>
  <text start="3881.969" dur="4.441">sawtooth pattern that we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="3883.499" dur="6.3">about mm-hmm gonna be that sine wave</text>
  <text start="3886.41" dur="7.159">carrier so you can can protect yourself</text>
  <text start="3889.799" dur="6.841">from it and I recommend that especially</text>
  <text start="3893.569" dur="5.26">when you have young children there there</text>
  <text start="3896.64" dur="4.469">are two ways I think about it one is</text>
  <text start="3898.829" dur="5.96">protect the sleeping area and protect or</text>
  <text start="3901.109" dur="6.48">protect the nursery mm-hmm and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3904.789" dur="6.371">several places out there that make a.m.</text>
  <text start="3907.589" dur="5.43">shielding less EMF is one of the</text>
  <text start="3911.16" dur="5.039">internet sites that I go to quite a bit</text>
  <text start="3913.019" dur="8.73">they&amp;#39;re expensive but yeah some of the</text>
  <text start="3916.199" dur="9.961">um excuse me tickle yeah they had it</text>
  <text start="3921.749" dur="8.04">here Wow it&amp;#39;s a long distance to go to</text>
  <text start="3926.16" dur="5.73">yeah some of the materials for aligning</text>
  <text start="3929.789" dur="6.9">a room are cheaper than you would expect</text>
  <text start="3931.89" dur="7.53">like they make a carbon loaded paper</text>
  <text start="3936.689" dur="4.56">that you can paint get put it up like</text>
  <text start="3939.42" dur="5.659">wallpaper and paint hold on I have to</text>
  <text start="3941.249" dur="3.83">get some water yeah go for it</text>
  <text start="3950.209" dur="6.28">you know I ordered some of the the the</text>
  <text start="3953.119" dur="6.16">paper cloth stuff that is supposed to</text>
  <text start="3956.489" dur="6.36">protect from the smart meters and yeah</text>
  <text start="3959.279" dur="6.42">smart meters are 2.5 4 gigahertz by the</text>
  <text start="3962.849" dur="4.321">way yeah so uh</text>
  <text start="3965.699" dur="4.65">and I imagine eventually they&amp;#39;ll go to</text>
  <text start="3967.17" dur="4.289">5g the thing that I don&amp;#39;t like about 5g</text>
  <text start="3970.349" dur="3.541">is that they want to put it in your</text>
  <text start="3971.459" dur="4.11">house it&amp;#39;s part the reason they want to</text>
  <text start="3973.89" dur="3.899">go to 5g is that it&amp;#39;s the Internet of</text>
  <text start="3975.569" dur="3.93">Things mm-hmm and that&amp;#39;s where all the</text>
  <text start="3977.789" dur="4.26">appliances are supposed to report back</text>
  <text start="3979.499" dur="4.411">on your usage patterns and you know</text>
  <text start="3982.049" dur="3.42">ultimate tracking so you&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="3983.91" dur="2.389">security code to open the door of your</text>
  <text start="3985.469" dur="4.05">refrigerator</text>
  <text start="3986.299" dur="5.471">yes let&amp;#39;s ignore that it was making Kyle</text>
  <text start="3989.519" dur="4.591">stare straight into the sky and</text>
  <text start="3991.77" dur="4.89">weird situations like that what before</text>
  <text start="3994.11" dur="7.65">they broke the big 5g emitter into small</text>
  <text start="3996.66" dur="10.59">5g emitters yeah yeah me sad like</text>
  <text start="4001.76" dur="7.53">distributed tower type things yes so</text>
  <text start="4007.25" dur="4.38">there you can do this carbon loaded</text>
  <text start="4009.29" dur="7.44">paper stuff and use it as wallpaper and</text>
  <text start="4011.63" dur="9.12">it&amp;#39;s expensive I think it&amp;#39;s a senior 45</text>
  <text start="4016.73" dur="5.61">or 60 inches wide well well let me ask</text>
  <text start="4020.75" dur="3.6">this because you mentioned carbon and</text>
  <text start="4022.34" dur="3.81">wallpaper what do you think of the idea</text>
  <text start="4024.35" dur="6.24">that I did where I mixed in shunga</text>
  <text start="4026.15" dur="9.63">powder into my paint um depending on the</text>
  <text start="4030.59" dur="7.38">density of the of the loading yeah that</text>
  <text start="4035.78" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s really gonna cause a variation I</text>
  <text start="4037.97" dur="5.22">mean you&amp;#39;re gonna have to know and you</text>
  <text start="4040.46" dur="4.59">could probably get it tested or you</text>
  <text start="4043.19" dur="5.82">could look the specs up there might be</text>
  <text start="4045.05" dur="6.48">specs that are stated for microwave</text>
  <text start="4049.01" dur="5.25">absorption you know you have to put in</text>
  <text start="4051.53" dur="5.13">like a quarter of a pound per quart of</text>
  <text start="4054.26" dur="4.23">paint or yeah you know something like</text>
  <text start="4056.66" dur="4.26">that very nice yeah</text>
  <text start="4058.49" dur="4.71">but you have to be very careful on I</text>
  <text start="4060.92" dur="5.24">used to work with those coatings I used</text>
  <text start="4063.2" dur="6">to do electromagnetic compliance where</text>
  <text start="4066.16" dur="6.28">medical devices have limits on how much</text>
  <text start="4069.2" dur="5.88">they can put out or how much they react</text>
  <text start="4072.44" dur="4.44">to something that is putting out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4075.08" dur="4.41">called susceptibility and there&amp;#39;s yeah</text>
  <text start="4076.88" dur="3.42">yeah radiate conducted emissions and</text>
  <text start="4079.49" dur="4.08">stuff like that</text>
  <text start="4080.3" dur="6.39">grand uh so if you know with paint the</text>
  <text start="4083.57" dur="5.039">thing about pain is it does have a half</text>
  <text start="4086.69" dur="4.919">have to have a certain density of</text>
  <text start="4088.609" dur="4.851">absorbing materials in it and so you</text>
  <text start="4091.609" dur="4.5">have to be really careful with us yeah</text>
  <text start="4093.46" dur="5.53">the the amount of material you put in</text>
  <text start="4096.109" dur="4.891">there to absorb mm-hmm what&amp;#39;s incredibly</text>
  <text start="4098.99" dur="4.44">cheap so I like I like it as an option</text>
  <text start="4101" dur="6.569">if it works yeah not too aware of its</text>
  <text start="4103.43" dur="6.06">frequency response there&amp;#39;s some great</text>
  <text start="4107.569" dur="4.381">videos on YouTube even just a minute</text>
  <text start="4109.49" dur="5.76">long videos where they use it to with a</text>
  <text start="4111.95" dur="5.43">power tester you know a meter for</text>
  <text start="4115.25" dur="3.99">radiation yeah I mean a microwave</text>
  <text start="4117.38" dur="3.33">something like that and they write bills</text>
  <text start="4119.24" dur="4.71">the signal completely goes to nothing</text>
  <text start="4120.71" dur="4.379">yeah yeah and but as I said if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4123.95" dur="3.24">too thin</text>
  <text start="4125.089" dur="5.041">yeah you know you&amp;#39;re gonna have less</text>
  <text start="4127.19" dur="4.5">absorption and also I have well I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4130.13" dur="3.779">been looking at the weakening</text>
  <text start="4131.69" dur="4.109">magnetosphere and I&amp;#39;ve been somewhat</text>
  <text start="4133.909" dur="5.46">concerned because I live at 8200 feet</text>
  <text start="4135.799" dur="4.951">and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking well it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="4139.369" dur="4.2">be a heck of a sucker and when gamma</text>
  <text start="4140.75" dur="4.409">rays start penetrating our atmosphere so</text>
  <text start="4143.569" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;ve been looking absorptive law</text>
  <text start="4145.159" dur="5.79">materials and I&amp;#39;m curious about those</text>
  <text start="4148.759" dur="4.08">things as well and the the flipping of</text>
  <text start="4150.949" dur="4.321">the poles and all of us off things that</text>
  <text start="4152.839" dur="4.77">we don&amp;#39;t usually think about yeah but on</text>
  <text start="4155.27" dur="5.759">the declining magnetosphere is just part</text>
  <text start="4157.609" dur="5.67">of our normal cycle but unfortunately it</text>
  <text start="4161.029" dur="5.221">causes more cosmic rays to penetrate our</text>
  <text start="4163.279" dur="5.431">atmosphere and that causes more clouds</text>
  <text start="4166.25" dur="4.109">and then that causes a shift in the</text>
  <text start="4168.71" dur="4.77">weather pattern and it&amp;#39;s kind of like a</text>
  <text start="4170.359" dur="5.25">giant feedback loop that I do agree with</text>
  <text start="4173.48" dur="4.799">John LKC that we are moving into an eye</text>
  <text start="4175.609" dur="5.311">stage or certainly I like I&amp;#39;m under</text>
  <text start="4178.279" dur="5.551">minimum something on that order I know</text>
  <text start="4180.92" dur="4.649">that um my my conditions you know that</text>
  <text start="4183.83" dur="4.32">you can&amp;#39;t just take one summer and fall</text>
  <text start="4185.569" dur="5.61">and make a judgment based on that but I</text>
  <text start="4188.15" dur="4.439">know I have noticed it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="4191.179" dur="2.04">running ten to fifteen degrees below</text>
  <text start="4192.589" dur="3.15">normal</text>
  <text start="4193.219" dur="8.371">seems to be getting cooler yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="4195.739" dur="7.411">it&amp;#39;s noticeable to me global you know</text>
  <text start="4201.59" dur="2.91">coming ice age is something that</text>
  <text start="4203.15" dur="3.199">concerns me and the rest of the world is</text>
  <text start="4204.5" dur="4.65">still caught up on global warming I</text>
  <text start="4206.349" dur="7.81">don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re just believing</text>
  <text start="4209.15" dur="7.23">the lie and no other all the signs and</text>
  <text start="4214.159" dur="6.151">and then you read a scientist like John</text>
  <text start="4216.38" dur="7.2">LKC who&amp;#39;s tracking all them the you know</text>
  <text start="4220.31" dur="7.95">cycles and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the coincidence of</text>
  <text start="4223.58" dur="6.329">a 31 year cycle and a 206 years I : you</text>
  <text start="4228.26" dur="3.689">know numerically speaking you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="4229.909" dur="5.25">gonna have that very often you just get</text>
  <text start="4231.949" dur="5.641">it about every 400 years you 400 to 600</text>
  <text start="4235.159" dur="4.681">years you get some kind of a drop yes</text>
  <text start="4237.59" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s like the one of my favorite shows</text>
  <text start="4239.84" dur="5.54">is Game of Thrones and one of the</text>
  <text start="4241.34" dur="7.649">slogans as winter is coming so never oh</text>
  <text start="4245.38" dur="5.98">well here&amp;#39;s something else I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="4248.989" dur="4.261">if you can see this - well this is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4251.36" dur="5.339">a little meter you can get you can get</text>
  <text start="4253.25" dur="4.95">it through less EMF mm-hmm but other</text>
  <text start="4256.699" dur="5.191">people sell it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4258.2" dur="6.87">makes it it&amp;#39;s a Trifield meter it is not</text>
  <text start="4261.89" dur="5.28">calibrated lab instrument but and if you</text>
  <text start="4265.07" dur="4.55">notice it has an analog meter scale on</text>
  <text start="4267.17" dur="4.95">it but I do like it because of other</text>
  <text start="4269.62" dur="4.54">purposes it doesn&amp;#39;t really I think you</text>
  <text start="4272.12" dur="5.1">can buy one now that has an extended</text>
  <text start="4274.16" dur="6">range mine doesn&amp;#39;t go up that high and</text>
  <text start="4277.22" dur="4.53">it goes up into microwaves but nowhere</text>
  <text start="4280.16" dur="5.19">near as high as what they&amp;#39;re using now</text>
  <text start="4281.75" dur="6.66">for weapons so this made basically not</text>
  <text start="4285.35" dur="4.98">be picking up anything like that</text>
  <text start="4288.41" dur="3.66">but if you&amp;#39;re worried about 5g this will</text>
  <text start="4290.33" dur="5.31">something like this would pick it up</text>
  <text start="4292.07" dur="6.36">very neat yeah thank you yeah a little</text>
  <text start="4295.64" dur="4.83">over 100 but like I said they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="4298.43" dur="4.02">calibrated lab instruments but you can</text>
  <text start="4300.47" dur="4.74">see the needle deflect and in fact</text>
  <text start="4302.45" dur="4.49">because this instrument I have pretty</text>
  <text start="4305.21" dur="4.23">much stay away from my laptop monitor</text>
  <text start="4306.94" dur="5.5">because it&amp;#39;s very strong magnetic output</text>
  <text start="4309.44" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s like being in a survival situation</text>
  <text start="4312.44" dur="4.86">on a foreign planet you have to consider</text>
  <text start="4314.54" dur="5.1">your your radiation your oxygen supply</text>
  <text start="4317.3" dur="4.68">your the quality of your water supply</text>
  <text start="4319.64" dur="4.5">all of these things that the didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="4321.98" dur="4.83">to necessarily think about no they kind</text>
  <text start="4324.14" dur="5.55">of I think they thought because they</text>
  <text start="4326.81" dur="4.83">existed that I was okay yeah yeah you</text>
  <text start="4329.69" dur="3.54">know it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m in you know since I</text>
  <text start="4331.64" dur="4.23">was a child I was drinking this water</text>
  <text start="4333.23" dur="6.96">and I&amp;#39;m not dead so yeah I water must be</text>
  <text start="4335.87" dur="7.59">good we have a you know they didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="4340.19" dur="6.9">a farm using glyphosate such an our</text>
  <text start="4343.46" dur="6.57">complex world nowadays I think yeah it</text>
  <text start="4347.09" dur="5.4">really is United get simple</text>
  <text start="4350.03" dur="4.05">yeah Jimmy thank you so much is there</text>
  <text start="4352.49" dur="2.76">anything else that you&amp;#39;d like to throw</text>
  <text start="4354.08" dur="4.32">out there that you think is your job</text>
  <text start="4355.25" dur="8.79">information yeah let me bring up this</text>
  <text start="4358.4" dur="9.45">slide um can you see that not yet you</text>
  <text start="4364.04" dur="5.82">know anyway so this is where I really</text>
  <text start="4367.85" dur="6.6">think community awareness is really</text>
  <text start="4369.86" dur="6.39">really important because it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="4374.45" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s really important to notice what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4376.25" dur="5.4">going on around you situational</text>
  <text start="4378.47" dur="4.53">awareness saves lives no matter what so</text>
  <text start="4381.65" dur="3.72">some you know people should be</text>
  <text start="4383" dur="6.21">monitoring zoning changes and bond</text>
  <text start="4385.37" dur="5.619">issues and I&amp;#39;m really a after all that</text>
  <text start="4389.21" dur="3.94">government experience I am</text>
  <text start="4390.989" dur="4.951">a government person and I I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="4393.15" dur="4.65">those meetings but some people do and</text>
  <text start="4395.94" dur="4.409">and that would be a really strong role</text>
  <text start="4397.8" dur="5.52">to play in your community to keep an eye</text>
  <text start="4400.349" dur="6.031">out for things that look like it could</text>
  <text start="4403.32" dur="7.89">possibly represent a taking you know</text>
  <text start="4406.38" dur="8.13">fifth amendment the takings clause yeah</text>
  <text start="4411.21" dur="7.38">so you know that and when outside</text>
  <text start="4414.51" dur="7.41">players start coming in for whatever um</text>
  <text start="4418.59" dur="4.92">you know I just think it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="4421.92" dur="4.199">important to notice what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="4423.51" dur="6.54">your government in your local government</text>
  <text start="4426.119" dur="5.611">and and state government just to see if</text>
  <text start="4430.05" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s a high-speed rail coming your</text>
  <text start="4431.73" dur="3.36">way</text>
  <text start="4433.11" dur="4.83">and the other thing about community</text>
  <text start="4435.09" dur="5.64">awareness is noticing who&amp;#39;s in your</text>
  <text start="4437.94" dur="7.32">community and who doesn&amp;#39;t belong because</text>
  <text start="4440.73" dur="6">if all of a sudden no you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4445.26" dur="3.359">all these trucks working on the</text>
  <text start="4446.73" dur="4.32">telephone poles all these guys up there</text>
  <text start="4448.619" dur="5.341">doing something to the telephone poles</text>
  <text start="4451.05" dur="5.219">you want to know what&amp;#39;s going on I hope</text>
  <text start="4453.96" dur="4.44">I really truly hope that we see hunt</text>
  <text start="4456.269" dur="3.72">open hunting season and I&amp;#39;m not calling</text>
  <text start="4458.4" dur="3.36">for violence but how open hunting season</text>
  <text start="4459.989" dur="4.44">on these devices when they go up people</text>
  <text start="4461.76" dur="5.729">just take them down and yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="4464.429" dur="5.04">because it&amp;#39;s self-defense ways that you</text>
  <text start="4467.489" dur="5.431">can do that knowing self-defense at this</text>
  <text start="4469.469" dur="5.34">point it is self-defense and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4472.92" dur="5.31">where I think a phone tree or some other</text>
  <text start="4474.809" dur="7.08">I put CB radios in my thing because</text>
  <text start="4478.23" dur="6.599">that&amp;#39;s citizen band radios and there is</text>
  <text start="4481.889" dur="4.951">there is regulation on those but they</text>
  <text start="4484.829" dur="3.901">are still pretty much fly by the seat of</text>
  <text start="4486.84" dur="3.75">your pants you&amp;#39;re not depending on a</text>
  <text start="4488.73" dur="4.92">large infrastructure like the phone</text>
  <text start="4490.59" dur="4.62">system like verizon network if you have</text>
  <text start="4493.65" dur="4.17">a CB and you need to get in touch with</text>
  <text start="4495.21" dur="5.07">somebody you know you can make</text>
  <text start="4497.82" dur="5.54">arrangements with others that have CDs</text>
  <text start="4500.28" dur="6.359">that becomes your own local</text>
  <text start="4503.36" dur="6.15">communication system rather than relying</text>
  <text start="4506.639" dur="6.721">on a big company like Verizon or</text>
  <text start="4509.51" dur="6.129">something like that to be there to have</text>
  <text start="4513.36" dur="4.56">their infrastructure intact or what have</text>
  <text start="4515.639" dur="3.75">they just decided to cut out that what</text>
  <text start="4517.92" dur="2.099">if their tower goes down then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4519.389" dur="2.13">stuck</text>
  <text start="4520.019" dur="3.75">yeah there&amp;#39;s problems it&amp;#39;s always good</text>
  <text start="4521.519" dur="3.031">to have a redundancy yeah so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4523.769" dur="2.901">recommending that</text>
  <text start="4524.55" dur="5.34">people have a fallback even if it is</text>
  <text start="4526.67" dur="4.54">inconvenient and primitive you&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="4529.89" dur="2.96">it&amp;#39;s really important to be able to</text>
  <text start="4531.21" dur="3.54">coordinate and communicate with people</text>
  <text start="4532.85" dur="3.97">yeah for short huh</text>
  <text start="4534.75" dur="4.86">anyway we went over the different kind</text>
  <text start="4536.82" dur="5.07">of bug out pack and the other thing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4539.61" dur="5.31">recommending for people with smartphones</text>
  <text start="4541.89" dur="4.85">particularly is that and any other GPS</text>
  <text start="4544.92" dur="5.54">you have in your vehicle or whatever</text>
  <text start="4546.74" dur="6.49">turn it off when you&amp;#39;re not using it</text>
  <text start="4550.46" dur="5.59">find out how to turn off your GPS</text>
  <text start="4553.23" dur="7.71">because the GPS is a two-way street you</text>
  <text start="4556.05" dur="7.65">are not just a receiver anymore you are</text>
  <text start="4560.94" dur="4.92">also a transmitter and so they know</text>
  <text start="4563.7" dur="4.59">exactly where you are and they because</text>
  <text start="4565.86" dur="3.93">of OnStar if you have OnStar in your car</text>
  <text start="4568.29" dur="3.93">they know exactly where you are of</text>
  <text start="4569.79" dur="4.74">course they do so maybe you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="4572.22" dur="5.04">OnStar maybe you shouldn&amp;#39;t have it maybe</text>
  <text start="4574.53" dur="4.68">you should turn it off yeah you know</text>
  <text start="4577.26" dur="3.33">maybe it&amp;#39;s not worth chipping your child</text>
  <text start="4579.21" dur="2.52">just so that you always know where they</text>
  <text start="4580.59" dur="2.63">are because the government will always</text>
  <text start="4581.73" dur="3.63">know where they are</text>
  <text start="4583.22" dur="4.9">yeah there&amp;#39;s so many things about</text>
  <text start="4585.36" dur="4.65">chipping we could agree to go for hours</text>
  <text start="4588.12" dur="3.78">about all the different things yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="4590.01" dur="3.93">and then the other part is to inspect</text>
  <text start="4591.9" dur="5.19">your car and your house and your mailbox</text>
  <text start="4593.94" dur="7.05">for weird symbols or devices</text>
  <text start="4597.09" dur="8.04">particularly on your car mm-hmm tracking</text>
  <text start="4600.99" dur="6.06">nice because I don&amp;#39;t know I just I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4605.13" dur="5.22">like it I mean even though I really</text>
  <text start="4607.05" dur="5.3">don&amp;#39;t care I mean I I just don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="4610.35" dur="4.98">the idea it&amp;#39;s a violation of our</text>
  <text start="4612.35" dur="4.6">constitutional rights for them to know</text>
  <text start="4615.33" dur="5.49">and if you you know if you know anything</text>
  <text start="4616.95" dur="6.18">about World War two IBM was the company</text>
  <text start="4620.82" dur="4.47">that enabled the Nazis to draw</text>
  <text start="4623.13" dur="4.44">connections between extended Jewish</text>
  <text start="4625.29" dur="5.16">families so they knew where to go and</text>
  <text start="4627.57" dur="5.16">who to find who was related to so that</text>
  <text start="4630.45" dur="4.8">they could yeah and Ford was in there</text>
  <text start="4632.73" dur="5.19">children and you know a lot of these</text>
  <text start="4635.25" dur="4.44">companies of today were weapons or even</text>
  <text start="4637.92" dur="5.78">chemical weapons makers in those days</text>
  <text start="4639.69" dur="7.4">and it&amp;#39;s just yeah it&amp;#39;s a big sick</text>
  <text start="4643.7" dur="6.28">scenario hopefully you know people have</text>
  <text start="4647.09" dur="5.29">some measure of confidence about things</text>
  <text start="4649.98" dur="5.9">at least maybe not necessarily good news</text>
  <text start="4652.38" dur="5.98">but at least you know what&amp;#39;s out there I</text>
  <text start="4655.88" dur="5.89">haven&amp;#39;t felt that people</text>
  <text start="4658.36" dur="6.69">what this device can do and and</text>
  <text start="4661.77" dur="6.82">unfortunately I have yet to figure out a</text>
  <text start="4665.05" dur="8.189">way to actually actually shield against</text>
  <text start="4668.59" dur="7.14">it because it is capable of mechanically</text>
  <text start="4673.239" dur="4.681">vibrating things two bits would be neat</text>
  <text start="4675.73" dur="7.739">if we were able to pinpoint where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4677.92" dur="8.819">at and shoot back yeah it would and that</text>
  <text start="4683.469" dur="4.831">brings me to my last slide yeah I just</text>
  <text start="4686.739" dur="4.351">want to show you something that yeah we</text>
  <text start="4688.3" dur="3.66">go and they slip up oh I think I just</text>
  <text start="4691.09" dur="2.79">got rid of it</text>
  <text start="4691.96" dur="3.48">no I can&amp;#39;t see your screen right now</text>
  <text start="4693.88" dur="3.66">there but yeah they beat me okay let me</text>
  <text start="4695.44" dur="5.04">share it I&amp;#39;ll bring it back up again</text>
  <text start="4697.54" dur="7.55">here I think I put it in here man</text>
  <text start="4700.48" dur="7.53">this is iifa encountered a couple of I</text>
  <text start="4705.09" dur="7.18">you know I suspect that in the future we</text>
  <text start="4708.01" dur="6">will have personal defense drones with</text>
  <text start="4712.27" dur="3.719">the sort of range eventually that would</text>
  <text start="4714.01" dur="8.58">be needed to go and stop a satellite</text>
  <text start="4715.989" dur="10.73">from harassing you I recommend to people</text>
  <text start="4722.59" dur="6.54">if you&amp;#39;re building a house think about</text>
  <text start="4726.719" dur="6.67">think about what&amp;#39;s gonna penetrate your</text>
  <text start="4729.13" dur="5.94">roof you know people who live in the</text>
  <text start="4733.389" dur="4.711">forested areas should always have metal</text>
  <text start="4735.07" dur="5.549">roofs right well metal roof in this kind</text>
  <text start="4738.1" dur="6.36">of a scenario having a metal roof is</text>
  <text start="4740.619" dur="6">horribly dangerous so the thing that</text>
  <text start="4744.46" dur="7.679">gets me about this is it it&amp;#39;s really a</text>
  <text start="4746.619" dur="7.77">catch-22 because the signal itself can</text>
  <text start="4752.139" dur="4.77">vaporize metal and set things on fire</text>
  <text start="4754.389" dur="4.951">and yet you want a metal roof because of</text>
  <text start="4756.909" dur="3.871">the fire because a forest fire and a</text>
  <text start="4759.34" dur="4.02">metal roof you know will protect your</text>
  <text start="4760.78" dur="4.74">home but in this case having a metal</text>
  <text start="4763.36" dur="6.27">roof really could almost be a liability</text>
  <text start="4765.52" dur="8.429">because it&amp;#39;s going to catch on fire so</text>
  <text start="4769.63" dur="10.68">let me find this file here I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4773.949" dur="9.721">I have to do a find I&amp;#39;m sorry no you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4780.31" dur="6.869">fine yeah take your time this I found</text>
  <text start="4783.67" dur="4.08">this and they took it off he took it off</text>
  <text start="4787.179" dur="3.151">the internet</text>
  <text start="4787.75" dur="4.11">not too long after I found it but</text>
  <text start="4790.33" dur="3.66">surprise there</text>
  <text start="4791.86" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re always taking things down here</text>
  <text start="4793.99" dur="4.05">we go I&amp;#39;ll bring it up it&amp;#39;s almost as</text>
  <text start="4796.96" dur="5.13">though they&amp;#39;re trying to cover things up</text>
  <text start="4798.04" dur="8.76">or something um sometimes they slip up</text>
  <text start="4802.09" dur="6.36">though not the openness of the word yeah</text>
  <text start="4806.8" dur="4.05">well it doesn&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t have to be a</text>
  <text start="4808.45" dur="5.52">great mind to have a great ambition for</text>
  <text start="4810.85" dur="5.61">power in general like don&amp;#39;t you think</text>
  <text start="4813.97" dur="6.6">the people that are in that position are</text>
  <text start="4816.46" dur="7.92">uh hello I don&amp;#39;t know they don&amp;#39;t seem to</text>
  <text start="4820.57" dur="5.64">be too good at anything else well I</text>
  <text start="4824.38" dur="4.89">think that there are some among them</text>
  <text start="4826.21" dur="6">among like the ruling class types that</text>
  <text start="4829.27" dur="6">that are very bright and you know they</text>
  <text start="4832.21" dur="5.46">have access to multi-generational wisdom</text>
  <text start="4835.27" dur="4.83">and that sort of a specialty right I</text>
  <text start="4837.67" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t necessarily think that most of the</text>
  <text start="4840.1" dur="5.67">people who are running the show have a</text>
  <text start="4841.99" dur="5.94">lick of sense or an IQ over 105 and I</text>
  <text start="4845.77" dur="4.08">think if they did they would shut it all</text>
  <text start="4847.93" dur="4.98">down and let the real intellectual was</text>
  <text start="4849.85" dur="6.18">out there solve the problem okay can you</text>
  <text start="4852.91" dur="5.46">see my screen yes okay this is a</text>
  <text start="4856.03" dur="5.37">PowerPoint presentation that I found on</text>
  <text start="4858.37" dur="5.25">the internet a couple years ago 2011</text>
  <text start="4861.4" dur="4.44">actually and what this was was</text>
  <text start="4863.62" dur="5.64">space-based positioning navigation and</text>
  <text start="4865.84" dur="6.6">timing it was an engineering forum forum</text>
  <text start="4869.26" dur="5.78">and this company called light Square had</text>
  <text start="4872.44" dur="7.89">a new idea for cell phone communication</text>
  <text start="4875.04" dur="7.12">and it was a completely different way of</text>
  <text start="4880.33" dur="5.16">modulating the signal completely</text>
  <text start="4882.16" dur="6.72">different frequency range they wanted</text>
  <text start="4885.49" dur="6.27">they had to do their due diligence they</text>
  <text start="4888.88" dur="7.23">had to perform a broadband system test</text>
  <text start="4891.76" dur="7.89">on this technology mm-hmm so that was</text>
  <text start="4896.11" dur="5.57">the the job of this this PowerPoint was</text>
  <text start="4899.65" dur="5.58">put out by the Department of Defense</text>
  <text start="4901.68" dur="5.77">which I find funny because in putting</text>
  <text start="4905.23" dur="4.8">out this PowerPoint they were telling</text>
  <text start="4907.45" dur="10.29">the whole world how to take down the GPS</text>
  <text start="4910.03" dur="9.42">system phony so okay the purpose was to</text>
  <text start="4917.74" dur="3.09">evaluate and assess light squares</text>
  <text start="4919.45" dur="4.2">planned deployment of a terrestrial</text>
  <text start="4920.83" dur="5.909">network of ancillary terrestrial</text>
  <text start="4923.65" dur="5.58">honing base stations okay so it was</text>
  <text start="4926.739" dur="4.951">coordinated with the FCC and the</text>
  <text start="4929.23" dur="7.14">Department of Defense and they have a</text>
  <text start="4931.69" dur="7.65">little graph of uh the base stations how</text>
  <text start="4936.37" dur="4.65">things were going to vary so they</text>
  <text start="4939.34" dur="5.04">developed the plan and I&amp;#39;m getting down</text>
  <text start="4941.02" dur="8.01">here to the what happened they put out</text>
  <text start="4944.38" dur="6.75">this 1520 around 1525 megahertz</text>
  <text start="4949.03" dur="5.16">well you can see single channel five</text>
  <text start="4951.13" dur="8.4">megahertz upper band this was five G</text>
  <text start="4954.19" dur="8.66">before it ever existed me and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4959.53" dur="8.91">what happened here you go</text>
  <text start="4962.85" dur="8.71">FAA all receivers lost GPS survey</text>
  <text start="4968.44" dur="5.87">receivers lost GPS NASA all</text>
  <text start="4971.56" dur="5.94">high-precision receivers for Sciences</text>
  <text start="4974.31" dur="6.69">were impact so not a basically an ox a</text>
  <text start="4977.5" dur="8.04">GPS service yeah US Coast Guard</text>
  <text start="4981" dur="6.19">okay go on oh yeah I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4985.54" dur="4.32">even realize that we kind of lost track</text>
  <text start="4987.19" dur="5.82">of time a little bit yeah so anyway I</text>
  <text start="4989.86" dur="5.76">just wanted to say that people need to</text>
  <text start="4993.01" dur="3.93">become watchdogs because I got this off</text>
  <text start="4995.62" dur="3.84">the internet and the next day it was</text>
  <text start="4996.94" dur="6.66">gone but basically fire responders</text>
  <text start="4999.46" dur="7.1">police if anybody wanted to disable an</text>
  <text start="5003.6" dur="6.05">emergency response look GM OnStar</text>
  <text start="5006.56" dur="4.99">everything lost GPS when they tried this</text>
  <text start="5009.65" dur="5.62">technology and they tried for it in New</text>
  <text start="5011.55" dur="5.939">Mexico in in I think New Jersey yeah not</text>
  <text start="5015.27" dur="4.8">too far from Washington and they they</text>
  <text start="5017.489" dur="3.71">found that this this car honey</text>
  <text start="5020.07" dur="3.839">eventually went out of business</text>
  <text start="5021.199" dur="5.801">um I think I got bought their</text>
  <text start="5023.909" dur="6.571">technologies probably not lost it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="5027" dur="5.429">bought yeah I imagine so anyway DoD put</text>
  <text start="5030.48" dur="5.489">out a PowerPoint on how to take down the</text>
  <text start="5032.429" dur="4.591">entire GPS system huh all right well</text>
  <text start="5035.969" dur="3.391">yeah thank you for that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5037.02" dur="3.63">interesting and then that is we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="5039.36" dur="5.58">covered a lot of different topics as</text>
  <text start="5040.65" dur="6.63">well yeah we sure have so hosting me I</text>
  <text start="5044.94" dur="5.19">appreciate that and I really I&amp;#39;m hoping</text>
  <text start="5047.28" dur="4.379">that this presentation can help us get</text>
  <text start="5050.13" dur="4.41">our communities thinking in a different</text>
  <text start="5051.659" dur="5.371">way yeah well we&amp;#39;re up there of these</text>
  <text start="5054.54" dur="5.64">things you know California&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="5057.03" dur="4.59">a good strong eye-opener in terms of</text>
  <text start="5060.18" dur="3.3">some things are just not as they appear</text>
  <text start="5061.62" dur="4.77">and the technologies are not what they</text>
  <text start="5063.48" dur="6.54">tell us they are my big question has</text>
  <text start="5066.39" dur="5.61">been who and I&amp;#39;ve had some speculations</text>
  <text start="5070.02" dur="5.63">that&amp;#39;s all they are speculations that I</text>
  <text start="5072" dur="10.92">think we might be seeing a deep state</text>
  <text start="5075.65" dur="9.1">China Google consortium mm-hmm I&amp;#39;d love</text>
  <text start="5082.92" dur="3.21">to see some statistics being gathered</text>
  <text start="5084.75" dur="3.74">and I don&amp;#39;t know if anybody&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="5086.13" dur="4.95">it on the number of structures that were</text>
