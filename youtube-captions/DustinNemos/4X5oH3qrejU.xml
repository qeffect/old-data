  <text start="68.52" dur="7.38">being disinformation mixed in with an</text>
  <text start="72.9" dur="5.46">attempt to profit from the movement not</text>
  <text start="75.9" dur="5.39">to be you know confused necessarily with</text>
  <text start="78.36" dur="5.759">earning a living from the movement but</text>

  <text start="97.56" dur="5.39">themself out this was David Seaman this</text>
  <text start="100.439" dur="7.47">was jerome corsi and this was alex jones</text>
  <text start="102.95" dur="6.879">all right now with isaac this is</text>
  <text start="107.909" dur="3.511">personal for me and this is basically</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="3.031">someone i considered a friend for those</text>
  <text start="111.42" dur="4.71">who have been following i&amp;#39;ve had him on</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="4.89">my channel many times you know we were</text>
  <text start="116.13" dur="4.83">allies we were we were brothers in this</text>
  <text start="117.75" dur="5.79">fight and i&amp;#39;ve been holding off on</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="4.199">saying anything too rough about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.54" dur="3">going on with him because you know out</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="5.001">of respect I wanted to give him time to</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="6.08">kind of realize his errors and such but</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="5.07">let&amp;#39;s establish a pattern here</text>
  <text start="132.62" dur="4.289">and some moron on YouTube put out a</text>
  <text start="135.23" dur="4.289">video attacking my family and my</text>
  <text start="136.909" dur="4.381">daughter blatantly making up complete</text>
  <text start="139.519" dur="3.871">lies and stuff and apparently he&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="141.29" dur="5.57">sort of alt media figure he&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="143.39" dur="6.659">necessarily very popular but he did this</text>
  <text start="146.86" dur="5.11">in response to a video that I did kind</text>
  <text start="150.049" dur="3.391">of criticizing some of what anti school</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="4.65">had said because I disagreed with him</text>
  <text start="153.44" dur="5.25">and you know it is my once when I do</text>
  <text start="156.62" dur="4.08">these videos rebutting someone I tend to</text>
  <text start="158.69" dur="4.769">do the entirety of their video so that</text>
  <text start="160.7" dur="5.52">you do not ever think that I am trying</text>
  <text start="163.459" dur="4.86">to hold anything out of context so I</text>
  <text start="166.22" dur="3.389">usually break down the entire video I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="168.319" dur="3.45">not going to do it this time</text>
  <text start="169.609" dur="3.871">because I really just want to address</text>
  <text start="171.769" dur="4.58">this video and then I didn&amp;#39;t even watch</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="5.849">the second half I just wanted to address</text>
  <text start="176.349" dur="5.291">the argument of the video because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.329" dur="3.901">what people seem to think that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="3.33">people have taken from his video he has</text>
  <text start="183.23" dur="3.839">some sort of argument some sort of proof</text>
  <text start="184.97" dur="3.989">right that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m gonna deal with</text>
  <text start="187.069" dur="3.241">and I&amp;#39;m gonna show you guys how I deal</text>
  <text start="188.959" dur="2.851">with that it&amp;#39;s gonna be real easy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.31" dur="3.36">real simple it&amp;#39;s not complicated and</text>
  <text start="191.81" dur="4.5">this is what makes me think chill</text>
  <text start="193.67" dur="4.26">alright because this he&amp;#39;s too smart for</text>
  <text start="196.31" dur="5.429">this he should know better he actually</text>
  <text start="197.93" dur="6.989">in fact I think has I&amp;#39;m fairly confident</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="4.231">that he knows better okay because anyone</text>
  <text start="204.919" dur="2.341">who&amp;#39;s been around the cube movement</text>
  <text start="205.97" dur="4.53">actually like following this stuff</text>
  <text start="207.26" dur="6.629">minute by minute like he has like I have</text>
  <text start="210.5" dur="5.099">you should know this already so let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="213.889" dur="6.591">through and then I&amp;#39;m gonna explain why</text>
  <text start="215.599" dur="8.04">he&amp;#39;s not only wrong but I think pushing</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="4.99">confusion I&amp;#39;m gonna apologize in advance</text>
  <text start="223.639" dur="4.021">for the quality of the sound here I try</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="4.109">to download the video something is</text>
  <text start="227.66" dur="4.25">different about this video today I was</text>
  <text start="229.579" dur="4.921">unable to download it to make a rebuttal</text>
  <text start="231.91" dur="4.299">VLC is my usual route to do so and</text>
  <text start="234.5" dur="4.049">usually it&amp;#39;s no problem it takes like 10</text>
  <text start="236.209" dur="3.721">seconds in this case I couldn&amp;#39;t get a</text>
  <text start="238.549" dur="3.361">download so there&amp;#39;s going to be a little</text>
  <text start="239.93" dur="12.51">bit of an echo but I think I can get the</text>
  <text start="241.91" dur="12.87">point across let&amp;#39;s confront reality so</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="4.859">when someone makes statements like this</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="6.17">all right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a form of it appeal</text>
  <text start="257.299" dur="6.541">to ridicule on a low level so it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="3.65">hey reality&amp;#39;s over here and wherever you</text>
  <text start="263.84" dur="2.65">are is not they</text>
  <text start="264.6" dur="3.48">okay so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s deal with this</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="3.24">reality let&amp;#39;s deal with this thing that</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="3.63">you won&amp;#39;t face that is true even though</text>
  <text start="269.73" dur="3.6">I can&amp;#39;t prove it to you</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s basically what he&amp;#39;s saying he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="3.48">never had an argument he&amp;#39;s only been</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="5.94">making fun of Q and Q and on supporters</text>

  <text start="539.77" dur="2.73">lying to people this is trying to</text>
  <text start="541.27" dur="3.93">confuse people around something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="542.5" dur="4.14">not really that confusing but maybe it</text>
  <text start="545.2" dur="3.3">would be if you&amp;#39;re not following the</text>
  <text start="546.64" dur="5.34">technical aspect of the 8chan boards</text>
  <text start="548.5" dur="5.39">which 99% of people are not so do not be</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="4.95">deceived by this deception</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="4.66">just because q posts as an anon</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="3.21">sometimes without actually signing in to</text>

  <text start="576.49" dur="4.16">q then yes that was actually Q posting</text>
  <text start="578.71" dur="6.26">okay it is really nothing complicated</text>
  <text start="580.65" dur="7.93">the fact that pamphlet mentioned that it</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="5.98">did not pop up on the feed these Auto</text>
  <text start="588.58" dur="4.56">feeds that many people have set up which</text>
  <text start="590.95" dur="4.29">just like I have here this these things</text>
  <text start="593.14" dur="4.68">pretty much automatically pull from Q</text>
  <text start="595.24" dur="4.8">and on strip code if he posts as an anon</text>
  <text start="597.82" dur="5.31">it has to be manually entered right</text>
  <text start="600.04" dur="5.43">because otherwise it does not pick it up</text>
  <text start="603.13" dur="4.29">there are like billions of messages from</text>
  <text start="605.47" dur="3.48">anons on there and it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
