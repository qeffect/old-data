  <text start="12.389" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;m Dustin demos of Dustin demos calm</text>
  <text start="14.49" dur="3.42">and I want to talk just very briefly</text>
  <text start="16.109" dur="3.601">about some of the division that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="4.32">on in the Q community I am convinced</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="3.989">after having pored through social media</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="3.36">and just talked about this and talked</text>
  <text start="23.699" dur="3.9">about the arguments back and forth for</text>
  <text start="25.59" dur="3.449">days now I&amp;#39;m convinced that there are</text>
  <text start="27.599" dur="5.101">people who are trying to intentionally</text>
  <text start="29.039" dur="6.571">cause anger and end division and and</text>
  <text start="32.7" dur="4.14">resentment and just spread confusions</text>
  <text start="35.61" dur="3.03">that make no sense when you think about</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="3.87">it because they don&amp;#39;t change they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="38.64" dur="5.22">bill they&amp;#39;ll continue to spread the same</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="4.8">stuff even when disproven so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="43.86" dur="3.48">obviously not to tell you it&amp;#39;s about a</text>
  <text start="45.51" dur="3.959">shield but when you&amp;#39;re engaging with</text>
  <text start="47.34" dur="4.649">someone and they&amp;#39;re a legitimate trump</text>
  <text start="49.469" dur="3.84">supporter and you think their heart is</text>
  <text start="51.989" dur="4.861">in the right place and maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="53.309" dur="6.27">angry maybe you&amp;#39;re angry back away from</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="4.32">the anger and come to terms with what</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="4.32">you guys agree on like we both love</text>
  <text start="61.17" dur="3.3">Trump we both hate pedophiles we both</text>
  <text start="63.899" dur="2.01">want</text>
  <text start="64.47" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re both conservative or we&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="4.381">whatever okay find your common ground</text>
  <text start="67.53" dur="5.699">and then be honest like look I just like</text>
  <text start="70.29" dur="4.59">an opportunity to throw some data your</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="2.971">way okay because this stuff is pretty</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="3.629">crazy and I think there&amp;#39;s something to</text>
  <text start="76.2" dur="4.169">it all right I understand that everyone</text>
  <text start="78.509" dur="2.97">has an echo you got it you&amp;#39;ve got to get</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="5.04">around the ego or they&amp;#39;re just not gonna</text>
  <text start="81.479" dur="5.881">listen to anything else and when doing</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="4.831">this never never ever ever get angry</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="5.43">alright when you are exposed to people</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="4.32">who are angry all right there are there</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="4.259">are stages of understanding and stages</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="5.07">of truth and stages of being woke and</text>
  <text start="97.049" dur="4.081">anger is one of them if it&amp;#39;s handled the</text>
  <text start="99.63" dur="2.69">wrong way and it can revert right back</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="3.57">to stage one and they start all over</text>
  <text start="102.32" dur="5.17">where they go further and they reject</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="3.989">cue forever because they were just</text>
  <text start="107.49" dur="3.39">introduced to it the wrong way</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="3.601">all right you need to even though</text>
  <text start="110.88" dur="4.739">there&amp;#39;s all this evidence that does not</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="6.81">matter to the ego right so always remain</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="5.731">calm have fun with it try to remember</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="3.78">that it&amp;#39;s a game of give and take when</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="2.089">you&amp;#39;re in a conversation it goes both</text>
  <text start="122.88" dur="3.989">ways</text>
  <text start="123.439" dur="5.471">you&amp;#39;ve got to approach that ego in such</text>
  <text start="126.869" dur="3.931">a careful way and and I&amp;#39;m no expert I</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="2.71">just I know that it nest it has to be</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="5.469">done right</text>
  <text start="131.62" dur="6.3">and I think that if you remain polite in</text>
  <text start="136.269" dur="3.061">common for example if they&amp;#39;re if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="4.08">getting angry at you the appropriate</text>
  <text start="139.33" dur="3.93">response then is to just back up and be</text>
  <text start="142" dur="3.09">like look I&amp;#39;m I don&amp;#39;t know why there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.26" dur="6.059">anger you know I&amp;#39;m just trying to</text>
  <text start="145.09" dur="5.759">communicate if you have reasons to to</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="3.721">not believe this or if you have evidence</text>
  <text start="150.849" dur="3.541">that disproves it that&amp;#39;s fine here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.04" dur="4.589">what I&amp;#39;ve seen here&amp;#39;s the evidence I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="154.39" dur="5.25">seen and if you haven&amp;#39;t been following</text>
  <text start="157.629" dur="3.72">if you haven&amp;#39;t been falling even harder</text>
  <text start="159.64" dur="3.51">than me because I&amp;#39;m not able to just</text>
  <text start="161.349" dur="3.151">debate this stuff completely at random I</text>
  <text start="163.15" dur="3.63">have to prepare as well obviously</text>
  <text start="164.5" dur="3.45">because there&amp;#39;s so much to it don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="166.78" dur="2.67">pretend that you&amp;#39;re gonna know</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="3.149">everything and don&amp;#39;t be upset if you</text>
  <text start="169.45" dur="4.319">can&amp;#39;t answer someone&amp;#39;s questions or</text>
  <text start="171.099" dur="3.961">their their rebuttal or whatever that is</text>
  <text start="173.769" dur="3.151">a great opportunity for you to learn</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="3.66">that is a great opportunity for you to</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="3.87">ask the community people who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="178.72" dur="4.98">around a little bit longer okay go to</text>
  <text start="180.79" dur="4.44">them seek out help on social media there</text>
