  <text start="26.609" dur="5.101">stuff this is a piece of art that I got</text>
  <text start="30.06" dur="5.31">back when I was still an info warrior</text>
  <text start="31.71" dur="7.22">and I still love this piece of art even</text>
  <text start="35.37" dur="6.119">though Alex Jones himself has of course</text>
  <text start="38.93" dur="4.36">made an ass of himself from the last</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="3.66">year or so with his lies about me and</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="5.789">it&amp;#39;s gonna kill me and things of that</text>

  <text start="50.46" dur="3.18">me multiple times and he&amp;#39;s holding the</text>
  <text start="52.079" dur="2.941">book where I accused him of being Mossad</text>
  <text start="53.64" dur="3.27">well he&amp;#39;s threatening the guy who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="3.24">accusing him of being a Russian one</text>
  <text start="56.91" dur="3.48">really accused him of being Russian we</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="4.319">know what it means right anyway let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="8.97">continue onto the topic here this is a Q</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="9.841">community roundtable to heal and I think</text>
  <text start="69.36" dur="4.95">that we need this you guys may know me</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="4.41">as the guy who goes after fake maggot</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="5.01">types and you guys may know me as</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="4.41">somebody who picks fights and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="4.77">fine because I pick fights with liars</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="4.019">and deceivers and and that&amp;#39;s the kind of</text>
  <text start="84.09" dur="4.29">fights that I want to be known for</text>
  <text start="85.259" dur="5.011">picking now on the other hand sometimes</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="5.279">people attack me and as a public figure</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="6.69">I do have to punch back and I take my I</text>
  <text start="93.659" dur="5.221">take my lead there from our president</text>
  <text start="96.96" dur="4.14">because he does the same thing and he</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="4.769">always punches back and I greatly</text>
  <text start="101.1" dur="3.9">respect that and I think that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="3.18">different I think that&amp;#39;s what sets him</text>
  <text start="105" dur="7.64">apart and I think that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="106.829" dur="9.57">effective I do not believe that being</text>
  <text start="112.64" dur="5.86">Placid for the sake of unity while we</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="3.811">are being deceived and lied to by people</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="6.329">within our myths is an appropriate</text>
  <text start="120.21" dur="7.199">reaction to evil I took use reusing my</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="4.35">own post as evidence to debunk the fake</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="5.931">matter of the sobic with his</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="7.501">iq propaganda this chat box right I</text>
  <text start="133.34" dur="5.709">can&amp;#39;t remember so Vic is McCain Q I</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="5.66">can&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t you said that at one point</text>
  <text start="139.049" dur="6.511">and then it was someone I can&amp;#39;t anyway</text>
  <text start="142.34" dur="7.06">continuing on I do believe that there is</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="7.95">a trend along the fake Magra and if I</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="5.55">can&amp;#39;t spot it who will right so and I</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t mean that arrogantly I just mean</text>
  <text start="154.95" dur="3.3">that that&amp;#39;s kind of my focus in fact</text>
  <text start="156.51" dur="4.589">that&amp;#39;s my part of the book my chapter</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="5.549">was about fake Magra specifically I use</text>
  <text start="161.099" dur="6.54">a couple of examples like a J and s</text>
  <text start="163.799" dur="6.631">Oberg but continuing kind of to go</text>
  <text start="167.639" dur="4.38">beyond that it&amp;#39;s just been a pattern for</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="2.97">months and I&amp;#39;ve put out videos I have a</text>
  <text start="172.019" dur="3.571">part on my web this section on my</text>
  <text start="173.4" dur="4.289">website in fact where many fake Magga or</text>
  <text start="175.59" dur="3.78">catalog to some of the habits some of</text>
  <text start="177.689" dur="4.05">the trends I&amp;#39;ve gone through in real</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="4.619">time and I&amp;#39;ve shown some of the fake</text>
  <text start="181.739" dur="4.2">Magga tactics where they will use</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="3.78">emotional tactics to build up</text>
  <text start="185.939" dur="3.601">credibility in fact if you just</text>
  <text start="187.769" dur="3.72">subscribe to Jack dorso book you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="189.54" dur="4.319">this all the time in real time he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.489" dur="4.86">doing a lot of rah-rah fluff stuff then</text>
  <text start="193.859" dur="4.77">he reports on the truth news but every</text>
  <text start="196.349" dur="4.081">time there&amp;#39;s a big issue these fake</text>
  <text start="198.629" dur="3.841">manga they find some reason to undermine</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="3.419">Trump or support just in a match or</text>
  <text start="202.47" dur="3.239">something like that right like I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="203.849" dur="4.2">know if the soba cast but you know glenn</text>
  <text start="205.709" dur="4.71">beck did that and then sort of exhorted</text>
  <text start="208.049" dur="4.141">having his his blue energy days right</text>
  <text start="210.419" dur="4.591">around midterms right saying we meet we</text>
  <text start="212.19" dur="5.25">deserve to lose that the house and the</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="3.99">senate things like that so these are</text>
  <text start="217.44" dur="3.24">trends these are patterns you learn to</text>
  <text start="219" dur="4.709">spot these things and you learned what</text>
  <text start="220.68" dur="5.01">to look for no I have never seen a more</text>
  <text start="223.709" dur="4.2">effective tactic from the fake manga</text>
  <text start="225.69" dur="5.219">that I&amp;#39;ve identified all of them than</text>
  <text start="227.909" dur="5.461">pushing one single issue that if you</text>
  <text start="230.909" dur="4.11">support q and on and you tell the truth</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="4.89">but you take in money that you&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="5.31">evil or exploitative person now this one</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="4.379">issue I think hits the hardest because</text>
  <text start="240.329" dur="11.31">it plays on human ego it plays on human</text>
  <text start="242.639" dur="11.13">sort of it plays on indie and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="251.639" dur="3.901">a wonderful part but it&amp;#39;s part of all of</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="4.71">our souls right we all have these</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="4.59">negative aspects of character but there</text>
  <text start="258.479" dur="2.051">are people in the truth movement who</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="2.77">have Cho</text>
  <text start="260.53" dur="4.35">to become journalists like myself or who</text>
  <text start="262.9" dur="4.11">have chosen to become public or have</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="4.14">been spend ops like myself numerous</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="4.2">times and therefore don&amp;#39;t have a choice</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="2.58">but to be public remember nemo&amp;#39;s is no</text>

  <text start="279.61" dur="3.69">the anons and the community out there</text>
  <text start="281.41" dur="3.75">but these days it&amp;#39;s getting difficult</text>
  <text start="283.3" dur="3.51">for me to even report on queue and on</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="3.63">without getting flack from fellow</text>
  <text start="286.81" dur="5.12">leaders within the queue movement for</text>

  <text start="387.55" dur="4.26">intend for this to happen I was so busy</text>
  <text start="389.56" dur="4.289">but it&amp;#39;s good that it did I brought up</text>
  <text start="391.81" dur="2.47">the issue about the the people that kept</text>

  <text start="394.28" dur="3.87">about wanting to have an audiobook which</text>
  <text start="396.38" dur="3.15">I don&amp;#39;t particularly care about honestly</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="3.57">like I&amp;#39;m not in a hurry to get an</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="3.42">audiobook I&amp;#39;ve already moved way beyond</text>
  <text start="401.72" dur="3.27">the book I&amp;#39;ve got so many other things</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="3.93">going on right now this book is just a</text>

  <text start="414.59" dur="5.91">request saying that she had in fact she</text>
  <text start="417.74" dur="4.17">was a professional like audio person</text>
  <text start="420.5" dur="3.18">that would do audiobooks and she</text>
  <text start="421.91" dur="4.29">volunteered to do it for free because</text>
  <text start="423.68" dur="4.739">her mother who was blind couldn&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="426.2" dur="3.99">and her only solace in life is to sit in</text>
  <text start="428.419" dur="3.361">a rocking chair and and listen to books</text>
  <text start="430.19" dur="5.64">and she was really looking forward to</text>

  <text start="459.65" dur="4.769">us can be stronger by by having this</text>
  <text start="461.75" dur="4.26">discussion because really I do see that</text>

  <text start="480.08" dur="3.81">be dealt with we have to sort this out</text>
  <text start="482.18" dur="5.7">we have to be able to talk to each other</text>
  <text start="483.89" dur="7.44">we have to keep a dialogue and this this</text>
  <text start="487.88" dur="6.599">issue I want to address simply because</text>

  <text start="725.12" dur="3.99">quite quickly it was really about who&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="738.46" dur="4.78">and then in trying to address that there</text>
  <text start="742.01" dur="2.82">was a lot of rudeness and a lot of</text>
  <text start="743.24" dur="4.35">suspicion and a lot of accused</text>
