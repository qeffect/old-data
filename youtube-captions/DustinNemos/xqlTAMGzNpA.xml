  <text start="166.04" dur="4.32">of commentary about shifts a little his</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="5.16">little parody speech I guess you&amp;#39;d call</text>
  <text start="170.36" dur="5.129">it and that was that was full panic mode</text>
  <text start="174.08" dur="4.11">wasn&amp;#39;t it that&amp;#39;s full breakdown of</text>
  <text start="175.489" dur="4.771">society stuff right there like imagine</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="3.99">if they were to actually persist and try</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="3.51">to go through with an impeachment it</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="6.51">would tear Society apart it would it</text>
  <text start="183.77" dur="9.63">would create a civil war would not make</text>
  <text start="188.69" dur="7.29">a lot of sense Judith that kind of ties</text>
  <text start="193.4" dur="4.46">into my my comment there on chef if</text>
  <text start="195.98" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;re asking me about impeachment there</text>
  <text start="197.86" dur="5.59">they&amp;#39;re over playing their hand in a</text>
  <text start="200.39" dur="4.65">very serious way because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="203.45" dur="3.45">anything to really do this with it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="5.43">going on a rumor and they look really</text>
  <text start="206.9" dur="5.49">weak or really stupid either way</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="5.31">the timing couldn&amp;#39;t be better for Trump</text>
  <text start="212.39" dur="5.34">going into 2020 so either they&amp;#39;re unable</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="5.88">to actually do any of their threats</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="5.46">against him or they are you know just</text>
  <text start="221.66" dur="3.78">dumb and don&amp;#39;t really know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="223.19" dur="5.04">doing so either way it doesn&amp;#39;t look good</text>
  <text start="225.44" dur="5.91">and as far as a chan being backup this</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="5.19">week it could be i know code monkey was</text>
  <text start="231.35" dur="3.93">talking about working on some of the</text>
  <text start="233.42" dur="4.379">backend stuff and they&amp;#39;re waiting for it</text>
  <text start="235.28" dur="5.34">to be back up should be soon so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="237.799" dur="5.641">see some more q post possibly that would</text>
  <text start="240.62" dur="4.5">be a more fun as well it&amp;#39;s been a while</text>

  <text start="247.61" dur="3.09">know we have plenty to do in the</text>
  <text start="249.41" dur="4.14">meantime there&amp;#39;s a lot of corruption</text>
  <text start="250.7" dur="5.04">being exposed and sq says you</text>
  <text start="253.55" dur="3.78">more than you know but I understand like</text>

  <text start="267.16" dur="4.36">caffeine addict says Dems want our guns</text>
  <text start="269.51" dur="4.26">healthcare freedom of speech</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="6.96">everything purged they do not care about</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="8.1">us absolutely right that is true hey</text>
  <text start="278.48" dur="5.87">Angie Hoffman good to see you from</text>
  <text start="281.87" dur="2.48">Minnesota</text>
  <text start="285.37" dur="5.71">Judith Taylor says I work in DC there is</text>
  <text start="288.5" dur="4.17">a real disconnect from with we have the</text>
  <text start="291.08" dur="5.01">rest of country from federal workers I</text>
  <text start="292.67" dur="6.3">believe it federal bureaucrats all</text>
  <text start="296.09" dur="4.38">bureaucrats I would say I mean even it</text>
  <text start="298.97" dur="3.15">came out even the ones at the DMV are</text>
  <text start="300.47" dur="3.84">probably the ones selling your contact</text>
  <text start="302.12" dur="4.5">information to the all these spam</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="5.94">callers and and scam callers and</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="7.4">everything else bureaucrats are just</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="3.77">like another kind of person aren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="315.1" dur="4.9">yeah more rumors about the Epstein spy</text>
  <text start="317.78" dur="5.55">video in bedrooms yeah that then came</text>
  <text start="320" dur="4.98">around made the rounds confirmations of</text>
  <text start="323.33" dur="5.01">stuff that we had heard like two years</text>
  <text start="324.98" dur="7.86">ago from queueing on by the way people</text>
  <text start="328.34" dur="6.96">should remember that Judith Taylor says</text>
  <text start="332.84" dur="5.4">too many federal employees are quote</text>
  <text start="335.3" dur="5.73">orange man bad end quote and trying to</text>
  <text start="338.24" dur="4.74">undermine Trump every day absolutely</text>
  <text start="341.03" dur="4.59">this holdover government really has to</text>
  <text start="342.98" dur="5.64">be dealt with and to some degree I think</text>
  <text start="345.62" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s also I think the onus is on</text>
  <text start="348.62" dur="4.02">conservatives to take over those seats</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="3.9">they shouldn&amp;#39;t exist we don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="352.64" dur="3.54">government in the first place is</text>
  <text start="354.23" dur="3.84">certainly not a massive over reaching</text>
  <text start="356.18" dur="3.54">government the way we have we did really</text>
  <text start="358.07" dur="4.349">well with it the most limited government</text>
  <text start="359.72" dur="4.47">in history in our early days in this</text>
  <text start="362.419" dur="3.541">country but if we have to have</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="3.84">government we can&amp;#39;t let lefty sit in</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="3.12">those positions we got to run for office</text>
  <text start="368.03" dur="6.12">everywhere</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="6.27">and win and that&amp;#39;s kind of you know</text>
  <text start="374.15" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s the difference between a movement</text>
  <text start="375.35" dur="4.5">and just another four-year election like</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="6.93">we this is sustained this is gonna keep</text>
  <text start="379.85" dur="7.16">going obviously I don&amp;#39;t know about you</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="2.93">guys but I&amp;#39;m having fun</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="4.15">yeah Judith every time I go to DC you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="4.44">saying DC is horrible</text>
  <text start="393.14" dur="5.01">every time I personally go to DC it&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="396.02" dur="4.05">have to watch over my shoulder or I feel</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="4.02">like I&amp;#39;m being I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="3.69">kind of a paranoia feeling I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="402.17" dur="4.08">not actually being watched every single</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="4.47">step I&amp;#39;m moving but I get that feeling</text>
  <text start="406.25" dur="3.51">you know and I&amp;#39;m like afraid to be</text>
  <text start="408.23" dur="4.22">recognized because I don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.76" dur="5.61">gonna try to you know who might hate me</text>
  <text start="412.45" dur="9.58">for who I am or something for supporting</text>
  <text start="415.37" dur="8.31">Trump I don&amp;#39;t know if you have to deal</text>
  <text start="422.03" dur="4.05">with that I&amp;#39;m sure that if you live</text>
  <text start="423.68" dur="4.14">outside of DC near DC and DC or anywhere</text>
  <text start="426.08" dur="4.59">in that vicinity you probably can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="427.82" dur="8.34">openly talk about Trump probably get</text>
  <text start="430.67" dur="9.3">assaulted for it informative info says</text>
  <text start="436.16" dur="6.21">Biden&amp;#39;s presidential run is over so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="4.19">good to see you informative and I agree</text>
  <text start="442.37" dur="4.32">I think you&amp;#39;re right about that</text>
  <text start="444.16" dur="4.53">Biden seems to be imploding and he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="446.69" dur="5.27">seem to keep his own life straight so</text>
  <text start="448.69" dur="3.27">almost time</text>
  <text start="457.59" dur="3.47">testing testing</text>
  <text start="461.389" dur="3.921">hmm audio issues</text>
  <text start="467.51" dur="4.34">I don&amp;#39;t usually like to make predictions</text>
  <text start="469.61" dur="4.41">unless I know I&amp;#39;m gonna get em right but</text>
  <text start="471.85" dur="3.73">getting my life back says any</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="5.7">predictions on who the Democratic</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="6.84">nominee would be popularity contest it</text>
  <text start="479.72" dur="4.47">would have to be a Tulsi Gabbard who I</text>
  <text start="482.42" dur="3.96">would love to meet just to invite her to</text>
  <text start="484.19" dur="3.84">join the bit burning withing because you</text>
  <text start="486.38" dur="4.32">know she&amp;#39;s suing big tech for censorship</text>
  <text start="488.03" dur="6.54">as well and this is a non partisan issue</text>
  <text start="490.7" dur="7.35">censorship is wrong however if I had to</text>
  <text start="494.57" dur="6.48">say it&amp;#39;s gonna be one of them</text>
  <text start="498.05" dur="5.13">I don&amp;#39;t know it can&amp;#39;t be Biden</text>
  <text start="501.05" dur="3.66">I don&amp;#39;t think Hillary&amp;#39;s gonna join back</text>
  <text start="503.18" dur="3.06">in she&amp;#39;s got a busy week this week</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="3.27">planned but I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="506.24" dur="3.81">announcing a presidency or anything I</text>
  <text start="507.98" dur="5.03">think she&amp;#39;s gonna be announcing you know</text>
  <text start="510.05" dur="6.77">attack Trump rhetoric and trying to to</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="5.86">campaign on impeachment basically I</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="12.7">don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t want to hazard a</text>
  <text start="518.87" dur="12.36">guess of who will be so Rita Yaeger says</text>
  <text start="529.52" dur="4.28">I think term limits should be imposed</text>
  <text start="531.23" dur="5.22">because it can read corruption otherwise</text>
  <text start="533.8" dur="5.14">yes if you don&amp;#39;t have term limits you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="536.45" dur="4.83">get more corruption but if you do have</text>
  <text start="538.94" dur="4.77">term limits you will get a short sight</text>
  <text start="541.28" dur="4.32">at a planning phase where you&amp;#39;ll end up</text>
  <text start="543.71" dur="3.99">with people more focused on running</text>
  <text start="545.6" dur="5.49">they&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re know getting office that</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="6.51">next election cycle rather than doing</text>
  <text start="551.09" dur="4.62">their job so you lose efficiency the</text>
  <text start="554.21" dur="3.84">counter for that I would say is probably</text>
  <text start="555.71" dur="5.43">the free market and just not letting the</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="5.07">government do anything you guys ever</text>
  <text start="561.14" dur="3.75">seen that I don&amp;#39;t watch a lot of TV but</text>
  <text start="563.12" dur="4.29">I saw one show I think he was called</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="4.05">Parks and Recreation and there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="567.41" dur="3.99">character in there who&amp;#39;s like a sourpuss</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="4.65">cynical guy and he&amp;#39;s I guess the manager</text>
  <text start="571.4" dur="4.26">of the boss or whatever and he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="573.59" dur="4.56">this funny scene where he talks about</text>
  <text start="575.66" dur="3.78">how the the only person that works for</text>
  <text start="578.15" dur="3.36">the government should be this one guy</text>
  <text start="579.44" dur="5.01">sitting in a bunker with a button that</text>
  <text start="581.51" dur="6.3">says nuke and that&amp;#39;s the only person we</text>
  <text start="584.45" dur="4.89">need and that&amp;#39;s kind of a joke but yeah</text>
  <text start="587.81" dur="2.79">I&amp;#39;m leaning that way too I think</text>
  <text start="589.34" dur="4.31">government just gets in the way most of</text>
  <text start="590.6" dur="3.05">the time I&amp;#39;m a free market guy</text>
  <text start="596.94" dur="6.93">so as far as cute returning David makes</text>
  <text start="602.55" dur="4.89">a good point here says hope to you</text>
  <text start="603.87" dur="5.22">return soon you&amp;#39;re the news now and into</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="3.36">that point you know we we had kind of</text>
  <text start="609.09" dur="3.6">our the news now I mean we being all of</text>
  <text start="610.8" dur="3.57">us because you know we destroyed fake</text>
  <text start="612.69" dur="3.81">news with President Trump leading the</text>
  <text start="614.37" dur="3.99">way alternative media destroyed the</text>
  <text start="616.5" dur="5.1">integrity and credibility of fake news</text>
  <text start="618.36" dur="5.7">you know Trump brought the attention but</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="4.29">we brought most of the arguments so you</text>
  <text start="624.06" dur="3.69">know I took a lot of time and now no one</text>
  <text start="625.89" dur="3.78">really trusts them anymore you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="627.75" dur="3.6">even a kind of a joke in some of the</text>
  <text start="629.67" dur="3.36">movies I&amp;#39;ve seen recently like the a</text>
  <text start="631.35" dur="3.06">spider-man movie I think we were</text>
  <text start="633.03" dur="3.12">watching that and they were joking about</text>
  <text start="634.41" dur="4.5">how the news never lives it&amp;#39;s in a</text>
  <text start="636.15" dur="4.47">cynical way like sarcastic way so you</text>
  <text start="638.91" dur="3.99">know everyone gets now that&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="640.62" dur="5.07">the Overton Window that fake news cannot</text>
  <text start="642.9" dur="5.19">be trusted he continued saying an on-set</text>
  <text start="645.69" dur="6.12">picked up the mantle many voices getting</text>
  <text start="648.09" dur="6.9">new info daily y&amp;#39;all kickin and then he</text>
  <text start="651.81" dur="5.13">says it ass probably but we kind of are</text>
  <text start="654.99" dur="3.72">we kind of aren&amp;#39;t like we&amp;#39;re winning on</text>
  <text start="656.94" dur="4.74">the the rhetoric we&amp;#39;re winning</text>
  <text start="658.71" dur="4.53">in terms of you know they&amp;#39;re having mass</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="4.11">layoffs mass cuts and ratings we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="663.24" dur="4.5">having we were having massive growth</text>
  <text start="665.79" dur="4.23">remember this channel started with</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="4.11">twelve hundred subs a day and then the</text>
  <text start="670.02" dur="3.45">algorithm kind of caught up to it and</text>
  <text start="671.85" dur="4.07">then earlier this year we froze at</text>

  <text start="741.31" dur="4.68">just have to get through the fire</text>
  <text start="743.61" dur="5.05">Breitbart talked about kind of that</text>

  <text start="774.49" dur="5.07">hmmm what people should be dealing with</text>
  <text start="777.7" dur="3.54">is deprogramming their brains from using</text>
  <text start="779.56" dur="5.24">Google I agree</text>
  <text start="781.24" dur="5.97">the attacker or spying on us and</text>
  <text start="784.8" dur="4.36">gathering so much information using it</text>
  <text start="787.21" dur="5.04">against us and no now they have a</text>
  <text start="789.16" dur="6.63">quantum computer that&amp;#39;s supposedly super</text>
  <text start="792.25" dur="3.96">powerful so that&amp;#39;s the scary end of</text>

  <text start="796.21" dur="4.92">especially if we can hack for example</text>
  <text start="798.13" dur="5.27">Bitcoin the entire network within you</text>
  <text start="801.13" dur="4.5">know another year - that&amp;#39;s incredible</text>

  <text start="817.81" dur="12.12">everyone else gets a quantum computer</text>
  <text start="819.37" dur="11.85">the senior executive services yep that</text>
  <text start="829.93" dur="6.75">gets brought up a lot especially in the</text>
  <text start="831.22" dur="8.34">last year I don&amp;#39;t think that necessarily</text>
  <text start="836.68" dur="4.35">it helps to bring up a case for for</text>
  <text start="839.56" dur="3.69">maybe Trump himself to start bringing</text>
  <text start="841.03" dur="4.56">attention against it I think he has to</text>
  <text start="843.25" dur="3.57">bring up like people need a target they</text>
  <text start="845.59" dur="4.53">need something to hate they need to face</text>
  <text start="846.82" dur="4.35">and you know the actual trees traders</text>
  <text start="850.12" dur="2.61">within our government that are doing</text>
  <text start="851.17" dur="3.9">this coup d&amp;#39;etat against our president</text>
  <text start="852.73" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re people that we hate now like</text>
  <text start="855.07" dur="5.01">their Comey aura mccabe so that i think</text>
  <text start="857.92" dur="6.39">is better for building a movement or</text>
  <text start="860.08" dur="7.29">building sort of a push to actually get</text>
  <text start="864.31" dur="4.35">rule of law justice even if maybe he</text>
  <text start="867.37" dur="3.48">wasn&amp;#39;t in position to get it when he</text>
  <text start="868.66" dur="4.35">started by the time we&amp;#39;re finished with</text>
  <text start="870.85" dur="4.56">this he may well be in a position to get</text>
  <text start="873.01" dur="4.92">it because the anger has built up so</text>
  <text start="875.41" dur="3.99">much against those specific people that</text>
  <text start="877.93" dur="3.72">whatever new rule could encompass the</text>
  <text start="879.4" dur="5.22">entire SES right it would just be in a</text>
  <text start="881.65" dur="4.92">footnote but the momentum the energy</text>
  <text start="884.62" dur="5.28">that that would be needed for him to</text>
  <text start="886.57" dur="5.01">change a law like that all those</text>
  <text start="889.9" dur="4.14">democrats keep changing things all the</text>
  <text start="891.58" dur="4.56">time if they need you know something to</text>
  <text start="894.04" dur="4.26">look different for example they want a</text>
  <text start="896.14" dur="4.17">whistleblower to maybe come out and say</text>
  <text start="898.3" dur="3.33">some things but he doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="900.31" dur="2.91">first-hand knowledge so they have to</text>
  <text start="901.63" dur="2.85">change the rules about first-hand</text>
  <text start="903.22" dur="4.76">knowledge with whistleblowers doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="904.48" dur="3.5">that make no sense at all</text>

  <text start="1799.39" dur="5.75">since before Q even X you know came out</text>
  <text start="1801.809" dur="5.561">it looks really good you know I</text>
  <text start="1805.14" dur="4.69">understand if there&amp;#39;s right legitimate</text>

  <text start="1809.83" dur="4.41">I can work with that you know if you if</text>
  <text start="1811.75" dur="5.34">you&amp;#39;re really legitimately pessimistic</text>
  <text start="1814.24" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s fine but I really do believe that</text>

  <text start="1836.16" dur="4.11">think that&amp;#39;s how it works they go with</text>
  <text start="1837.69" dur="4.53">whoever has the power if she showed up</text>
  <text start="1840.27" dur="3.57">and had the you know the polls they</text>
  <text start="1842.22" dur="4.23">would back her in a heartbeat they just</text>
  <text start="1843.84" dur="5.07">know that everyone hates her and I think</text>
  <text start="1846.45" dur="6.66">that&amp;#39;s why that she&amp;#39;s more useful as a</text>
  <text start="1848.91" dur="6.45">way to stir the pot and attack Trump and</text>
  <text start="1853.11" dur="4.95">maybe help fundraise but not necessarily</text>
  <text start="1855.36" dur="4.65">as a way to legitimately try to take</text>
  <text start="1858.06" dur="4.37">Trump on an election I think they know</text>
  <text start="1860.01" dur="2.42">better than that</text>
  <text start="1862.7" dur="8.53">just my opinion oh yeah I probably</text>
  <text start="1867.3" dur="10.14">should go actually just because of the</text>
  <text start="1871.23" dur="8.91">back thing John makes a good point as</text>

  <text start="1970.28" dur="5.31">conversation between a lot of you know</text>
  <text start="1973.64" dur="5.31">social media influencers and independent</text>
  <text start="1975.59" dur="6.12">voices like my own and you know legal</text>
  <text start="1978.95" dur="5.58">counsel and just kind of a Q&amp;amp;A session</text>
  <text start="1981.71" dur="5.16">and seeing what the options are but it</text>
  <text start="1984.53" dur="3.93">was a conversation starter and from that</text>
  <text start="1986.87" dur="4.17">conversation I think that we actually</text>
  <text start="1988.46" dur="4.23">have a good shot and that I&amp;#39;m not alone</text>
  <text start="1991.04" dur="4.2">in this that we can actually build a</text>
  <text start="1992.69" dur="8.46">movement with the momentum necessary to</text>
  <text start="1995.24" dur="11.13">take on big tech so you know I realized</text>
  <text start="2001.15" dur="8.55">that that might sound crazy but think</text>
  <text start="2006.37" dur="5.25">about this within that movement or</text>
  <text start="2009.7" dur="5.46">within that that meeting we already had</text>
  <text start="2011.62" dur="7.2">enough influence or reach if you will to</text>
  <text start="2015.16" dur="6.33">reach millions imagine if instead of a</text>
  <text start="2018.82" dur="5.7">dozen or more we had a hundred or more</text>
  <text start="2021.49" dur="5.16">show up you know people who were already</text>
  <text start="2024.52" dur="4.92">tired of this crap tired of being band</text>
  <text start="2026.65" dur="4.71">tired of being censored tired of being</text>
  <text start="2029.44" dur="6.87">deep lat formed and demonetized and be</text>
  <text start="2031.36" dur="6.06">boosted those are my people and if we</text>
  <text start="2036.31" dur="2.52">can meet enough for them if we could</text>
  <text start="2037.42" dur="3.66">bring enough of them into the stop that</text>
  <text start="2038.83" dur="4.08">burning movement I think we could win I</text>
  <text start="2041.08" dur="3.83">think we can actually do something like</text>
  <text start="2042.91" dur="4.2">a walk away movement but for censorship</text>
  <text start="2044.91" dur="6.22">something big something that would get a</text>
  <text start="2047.11" dur="7.86">lot of attention I think like you said</text>
  <text start="2051.13" dur="6.18">together we&amp;#39;re stronger and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2054.97" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re afraid of the most so this is</text>
  <text start="2057.31" dur="3.18">kind of my where we go one with all</text>
