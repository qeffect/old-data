  <text start="132.65" dur="6.51">let&amp;#39;s go through a few things here okay</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="6.51">now obviously the the scandal so far has</text>
  <text start="139.16" dur="5.1">been that Biden was exposed for</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="4.65">corruption actually months months months</text>
  <text start="144.26" dur="4.41">back and then he was recently it was</text>
  <text start="147.02" dur="3.24">kind of brought back up and he&amp;#39;s lashing</text>
  <text start="148.67" dur="3.75">out at President Trump and the other</text>
  <text start="150.26" dur="4.26">Democrats are just up in arms trying to</text>
  <text start="152.42" dur="4.32">find a way to impeach Trump now because</text>
  <text start="154.52" dur="3.78">I guess they&amp;#39;re their line in the sand</text>
  <text start="156.74" dur="2.94">was crossed when</text>
  <text start="158.3" dur="3.96">it looked like one of their own could go</text>
  <text start="159.68" dur="5.7">down potentially for jail time you know</text>
  <text start="162.26" dur="5.34">this is iDEN would definitely qualify</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="3.93">for treasonous accent and jail time for</text>
  <text start="167.6" dur="4.56">this I mean he was selling out the</text>
  <text start="169.31" dur="4.74">country for personal interests Wow all</text>
  <text start="172.16" dur="3.18">right and intimidating foreign people</text>
  <text start="174.05" dur="4.74">you know foreign leaders in other</text>
  <text start="175.34" dur="5.7">countries which would you know put us at</text>
  <text start="178.79" dur="3.84">a disadvantage long term internationally</text>
  <text start="181.04" dur="3.66">if we build up resentment because we</text>
  <text start="182.63" dur="4.59">were bullying them for personal gain</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="4.14">things like that anyway so some of the</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="4.02">updates he now claims that he never</text>
  <text start="188.84" dur="5.82">spoke to his son about Ukraine dealings</text>
  <text start="191.24" dur="5.4">and forgot son said the opposite so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="194.66" dur="4.56">already been caught in a big law here</text>
  <text start="196.64" dur="5.13">and that&amp;#39;s not a big surprise obviously</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="5.28">Biden is is on the way out mentally he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="201.77" dur="4.65">making mistakes and his mistakes are as</text>
  <text start="204.5" dur="4.14">big as basically admitting to the crime</text>
  <text start="206.42" dur="5.7">remember he he fessed up and he even</text>
  <text start="208.64" dur="6.72">bragged about how he had intimidated it</text>
  <text start="212.12" dur="5.91">and put weight against Ukrainian</text>
  <text start="215.36" dur="4.77">government in order to fire this</text>
  <text start="218.03" dur="5.64">prosecutor that was looking into his son</text>
  <text start="220.13" dur="4.41">and that was that was the end of that or</text>
  <text start="223.67" dur="4.59">so he thought</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="5.46">so going through a few more things okay</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="3.51">quick interruption there sorry there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230" dur="3.84">uh we just got rid of the little puppy</text>
  <text start="231.77" dur="4.38">that that came we found the owner for it</text>
  <text start="233.84" dur="4.44">kind of unfortunately cuz we were hoping</text>
  <text start="236.15" dur="5.85">that no one would claim it but they did</text>
  <text start="238.28" dur="4.89">so back to its original family but it</text>
  <text start="242" dur="4.77">was fun to have a little puppy around</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="6">anyway so back to the points we have you</text>
  <text start="246.77" dur="3.719">know the CNN crew of course if you if</text>
  <text start="249.17" dur="3.63">you really want to call them you know</text>
  <text start="250.489" dur="3.991">news folks I basically just refer them</text>
  <text start="252.8" dur="3.48">as propagandists at this point I mean</text>
  <text start="254.48" dur="4.05">there that&amp;#39;s basically what they do for</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="4.26">a living they they didn&amp;#39;t seem very</text>
  <text start="258.53" dur="3.66">happy about the fact that you know these</text>
  <text start="260.54" dur="4.8">look at their facial expressions I mean</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="4.68">it shows exactly the kind of people they</text>
  <text start="265.34" dur="2.97">are they&amp;#39;re really biased they really</text>
  <text start="266.87" dur="2.82">hate this president they&amp;#39;re just looking</text>
  <text start="268.31" dur="4.29">to hurt him as much as they can of</text>
  <text start="269.69" dur="5.55">course they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re fake news and</text>
  <text start="272.6" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve been ruined by it and and Trump</text>
  <text start="275.24" dur="3.45">has destroyed their entire business</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="4.32">because their ratings are just down down</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="5.81">down the only reason people even watch</text>
  <text start="281" dur="7.26">them anymore is to hear about Trump so</text>
  <text start="284.5" dur="5.979">continuing on we also have the Wall</text>
  <text start="288.26" dur="3.06">Street Journal actually published</text>
  <text start="290.479" dur="2.701">something</text>
  <text start="291.32" dur="4.14">that was sort of pro-trump I&amp;#39;m surprised</text>
  <text start="293.18" dur="6.21">so this was an attempt to take out a</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="8.19">president this is from see Kimberly</text>
  <text start="299.39" dur="7.59">Strauss all and you know this is this is</text>
  <text start="303.65" dur="5.22">a fit you know a fake news outlet but at</text>
  <text start="306.98" dur="4.8">the same point even they&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="4.32">actually float some things that are a</text>
  <text start="311.78" dur="3.78">little bit of truth out there because</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s falling apart their whole</text>
  <text start="315.56" dur="3.96">narrative is falling apart and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="317.96" dur="4.17">gonna have to start covering these</text>
  <text start="319.52" dur="5.01">things with a little bit more honesty</text>
  <text start="322.13" dur="4.98">and a little bit more subtlety in their</text>
  <text start="324.53" dur="6.12">spend because it&amp;#39;s all too obvious their</text>
  <text start="327.11" dur="5.1">tricks are exposed so you know going</text>
  <text start="330.65" dur="3.09">through some of these post real fast</text>
  <text start="332.21" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ll go through them with you it looks</text>
  <text start="333.74" dur="4.77">like there&amp;#39;s ten total having read do</text>

  <text start="338.51" dur="3.81">real story this is another internal</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="5.49">attempt to take out a president on the</text>
  <text start="342.32" dur="5.46">basis of another non-smoking kund as to</text>
  <text start="345.95" dur="4.5">call the transcript itself</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="4.5">Trump&amp;#39;s actual favor is that Ukraine</text>
  <text start="350.45" dur="4.65">look backward to what happened in the</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="4.53">2016 election this is a legitimate ask</text>
  <text start="355.1" dur="5.43">since election meddling looks to have</text>
  <text start="356.81" dur="5.43">come from both Russia and Ukraine oh man</text>
  <text start="360.53" dur="3.18">so I just tied him right in now they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="362.24" dur="3.09">pissed off everyone about the whole</text>
  <text start="363.71" dur="4.23">Russia rush of collusion now we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="4.08">use it against them indeed this is a big</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="4.02">enough issue that we find out this</text>
  <text start="369.41" dur="4.47">morning that US Attorney John Durham is</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="6.33">looking at what role the Ukraine played</text>
  <text start="373.88" dur="6.78">in the FBI investigation I think she</text>
  <text start="378.29" dur="4.17">meant that Ukraine played it is actually</text>
  <text start="380.66" dur="3.99">szalinski who brings up Rudy Giuliani</text>
  <text start="382.46" dur="3.66">saying they can&amp;#39;t wait to meet him and</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="3.75">it is Olinsky who references that</text>
  <text start="386.12" dur="4.14">investigation as he goes on to promise</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="5.91">that all investigations will be done</text>
  <text start="390.26" dur="5.64">openly and candidly Trump says good and</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="4.65">expresses worries that a good prosecutor</text>
  <text start="395.9" dur="5.01">was shut down mentions Biden&amp;#39;s son and</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="5.34">that Biden bragged he stopped the</text>
  <text start="400.91" dur="7.29">prosecution ends that bit with it sounds</text>
  <text start="404.3" dur="5.73">horrible to me Trump&amp;#39;s several</text>
  <text start="408.2" dur="3.72">references to Giuliani are mostly to say</text>
  <text start="410.03" dur="4.32">what a great guy he is he says he will</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="5.24">have Giuliani and a G bar call</text>
  <text start="414.35" dur="6.72">yes Solinsky to speak and work with both</text>
  <text start="417.16" dur="5.68">and never mind because DOJ in a</text>
  <text start="421.07" dur="2.819">statement says the president has not</text>
  <text start="422.84" dur="3">spoken to AG</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="5.28">about investigating Biden and has not</text>
  <text start="425.84" dur="6.479">asked the AG to contact the Ukraine also</text>

  <text start="498.529" dur="5.91">president on a rumor and here we go we</text>
  <text start="502.159" dur="3.151">already know that they hate him so this</text>
  <text start="504.439" dur="3.21">is just gonna lead to them getting</text>
  <text start="505.31" dur="4.949">investigated and arrested possibly for</text>
  <text start="507.649" dur="6.27">their own crimes sorry my spine Driss</text>
  <text start="510.259" dur="6.301">acting up today so Rudy drops new bombs</text>
  <text start="513.919" dur="5.881">slams Obama Cabinet pattern of</text>
  <text start="516.56" dur="4.68">corruption and claims China bought Biden</text>
  <text start="519.8" dur="3.84">and he&amp;#39;s been talking a lot about that</text>
  <text start="521.24" dur="4.77">1.5 billion dollars that China dropped</text>
  <text start="523.64" dur="4.11">on Biden&amp;#39;s son very quickly after being</text>
  <text start="526.01" dur="4.8">flown over on Air Force two of all</text>
  <text start="527.75" dur="5.97">places and this and he keeps bringing</text>
  <text start="530.81" dur="4.08">this up the guy is a drug addict he was</text>
  <text start="533.72" dur="2.79">kicked out of the military for being a</text>
  <text start="534.89" dur="3.75">drug addict months before this happened</text>
  <text start="536.51" dur="3.78">apparently so if that were the case did</text>
  <text start="538.64" dur="4.199">we suddenly suspect that he just got</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="4.409">better daddy had a talking to him and he</text>
  <text start="542.839" dur="3.781">became an upright that is a business guy</text>
  <text start="544.699" dur="3.461">that level of business without any prior</text>
  <text start="546.62" dur="5.44">contacts in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="548.16" dur="7.08">China or the oil industry doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="552.06" dur="6.63">sense does it however at least he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="555.24" dur="4.53">still you know whatever I guess he</text>
  <text start="558.69" dur="4.71">thought he was gonna get away with it</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="5.22">was my point so continuing on we have</text>
  <text start="563.4" dur="3.63">the White House to release documents</text>
  <text start="564.99" dur="4.68">showing Intel community watchdog found</text>
  <text start="567.03" dur="5.67">whistleblower had political bias of</text>
  <text start="569.67" dur="5.55">course we also have Ukraine calling</text>
  <text start="572.7" dur="4.71">transcript our call transcript shows</text>
  <text start="575.22" dur="4.74">that you Trump sought Biden probe but he</text>
  <text start="577.41" dur="4.71">also asked about the DNC server which is</text>
  <text start="579.96" dur="5.13">this is a huge deal but he did not make</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="4.53">any mention of US aid so what does that</text>
  <text start="585.09" dur="5.13">mean that means that Trump is still</text>
  <text start="586.65" dur="5.82">pursuing possibly seth rich justice and</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s still pursuing what happened in the</text>
  <text start="592.47" dur="5.7">the wikileaks DNC server issue</text>
  <text start="594.93" dur="5.13">I wasn&amp;#39;t Russia but they can&amp;#39;t stop him</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="3.57">because why don&amp;#39;t you want to find out</text>
  <text start="600.06" dur="3.81">what Russia did in our elections right</text>
  <text start="601.74" dur="3.81">so he&amp;#39;s gonna use that against them or</text>
  <text start="603.87" dur="3.99">something else equally effective because</text>
  <text start="605.55" dur="3.93">what it was it gonna look like if Trump</text>
  <text start="607.86" dur="3.21">is legitimately going he&amp;#39;s proven to not</text>
  <text start="609.48" dur="3.36">be involved with the Russian collusion</text>
  <text start="611.07" dur="3.99">but they&amp;#39;ve made such a big deal about</text>
