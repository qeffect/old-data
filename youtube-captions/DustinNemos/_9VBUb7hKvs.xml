  <text start="94" dur="5.7">is actually joining Trump&amp;#39;s legal team</text>
  <text start="96.06" dur="6.97">over the whole impeachment issue so this</text>
  <text start="99.7" dur="5.25">is quite fascinating tapped to serve as</text>
  <text start="103.03" dur="3.98">outside counsel to President Donald</text>
  <text start="104.95" dur="5.46">Trump as the house impeachment inquiry</text>
  <text start="107.01" dur="6.07">expands so that&amp;#39;s one thing that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="110.41" dur="4.44">kind of on the total impeachment list</text>
  <text start="113.08" dur="3.63">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of things impeachment</text>
  <text start="114.85" dur="4.79">related here that we&amp;#39;re gonna cover a</text>
  <text start="116.71" dur="5.13">little bit of it&amp;#39;s just the whole</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="3.94">build-up to there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="121.84" dur="3.66">things here that are connected obviously</text>
  <text start="123.58" dur="4.95">for example Mueller here lying under</text>
  <text start="125.5" dur="5.28">oath got to kind of go back in history</text>
  <text start="128.53" dur="4.59">just a little bit and then you see that</text>
  <text start="130.78" dur="5.04">this was all part of the same effort to</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="4.17">build up to this fake impeachment I</text>
  <text start="135.82" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t know if anyone else is calling it</text>
  <text start="137.29" dur="4.44">that yet but fake impeachment seems like</text>
  <text start="138.94" dur="3.3">a pretty good phrase for this whole</text>
  <text start="141.73" dur="2.84">thing</text>
  <text start="142.24" dur="5.01">if we&amp;#39;re gonna brand it with anything so</text>
  <text start="144.57" dur="5.2">confirmed Mueller committed perjury and</text>
  <text start="147.25" dur="5.79">lied under oath about pursuing FBI</text>
  <text start="149.77" dur="5.73">directorship in meeting with Trump so</text>
  <text start="153.04" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s very interesting multiple</text>
  <text start="155.5" dur="5.43">administration officials till at bret</text>
  <text start="158.47" dur="5.489">baier and myself this is from jake</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="6.15">Gibson that when Robert Mueller met with</text>
  <text start="163.959" dur="5.341">President Trump in May of 2017 Mueller</text>
  <text start="167.08" dur="4.86">was indeed pursuing the open post as the</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="4.65">director of the FBI something the former</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="7.049">Russia probe Special Counsel denied</text>
  <text start="173.95" dur="6.509">under oath boom and then continuing on</text>
  <text start="178.989" dur="3.391">we have President Trump</text>
  <text start="180.459" dur="4.891">responding to this saying can&amp;#39;t let this</text>
  <text start="182.38" dur="5.22">pass about the whole lying debacle</text>
  <text start="185.35" dur="6.3">obviously this is a criminal action that</text>
  <text start="187.6" dur="6.03">he&amp;#39;s lied under oath so president Trump</text>
  <text start="191.65" dur="4.369">is just looking for equal justice under</text>
  <text start="193.63" dur="6.27">the wall instead of this two-tier system</text>
  <text start="196.019" dur="7.241">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of understandable that</text>
  <text start="199.9" dur="5.91">he would want to do this let&amp;#39;s see right</text>
  <text start="203.26" dur="5.1">here and he&amp;#39;s responding to his own son</text>
  <text start="205.81" dur="4.709">Donald Trump jr. who I might get to meet</text>
  <text start="208.36" dur="3.629">by the way cuz I&amp;#39;ll be at American</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="4.56">priority I think he&amp;#39;s gonna be there as</text>
  <text start="211.989" dur="5.791">well so that&amp;#39;s gonna be very exciting in</text>
  <text start="215.079" dur="4.831">Miami Florida if anyone&amp;#39;s around I think</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="5.22">you can actually go for like I think the</text>
  <text start="219.91" dur="5.37">tickets like $75 to go if you&amp;#39;re a local</text>
  <text start="223" dur="4.709">Florida resident and you have the</text>
  <text start="225.28" dur="4.829">discount code which I don&amp;#39;t have in</text>
  <text start="227.709" dur="4.081">front of me but I&amp;#39;ll put out a tweet or</text>
  <text start="230.109" dur="3">something about it today it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="3.449">easy to find the discount code actually</text>
  <text start="233.109" dur="3.571">I think so if you get that it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="4.111">easy to get into this and you could see</text>
  <text start="236.68" dur="4.97">some great speakers some some great you</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="5.31">know networking some interesting people</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="4.57">so anyway Donald Trump jr. says</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="4.919">interesting I thought he testified</text>
  <text start="246.22" dur="5.669">otherwise under oath after watching the</text>
  <text start="249.579" dur="4.321">left-wing clown show live for years</text>
  <text start="251.889" dur="5.16">saying I perjured myself this will be</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="4.98">fun to watch and he&amp;#39;s linking to a sort</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="4.651">of a Fox News article about this and by</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="3.21">the way Fox News are completely anti</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="1.8">Trump</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to talk about that at</text>
  <text start="263.5" dur="6.66">some point more in-depth and and Trump</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="4.89">says so true Don and this was a big line</text>
  <text start="270.16" dur="5.16">look what happened to friends of Trump</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="4.8">for Less can&amp;#39;t let this pass so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.32" dur="3.66">what he&amp;#39;s saying I mean people that have</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="3.57">supported President Trump for example</text>
  <text start="278.98" dur="5.22">manna for it have been railroaded by the</text>
  <text start="280.66" dur="6.3">system while you know people like the</text>
  <text start="284.2" dur="6.48">Podesta&amp;#39;s get to close up shop and skate</text>
  <text start="286.96" dur="5.7">free with no criminal action at all and</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="4.83">their past they in fact they probably</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="5.52">get immunity or something so continuing</text>
  <text start="295.51" dur="3.99">on we have this one was a pretty good if</text>

  <text start="331.06" dur="6.23">if I can get you to the appropriate clip</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="8.55">here I don&amp;#39;t want to take the vote a ocv</text>
  <text start="337.29" dur="8.62">incandescent ignoramus is manifesting</text>
  <text start="342.07" dur="6.27">the same stupidity the entire Democratic</text>
  <text start="345.91" dur="4.35">caucus reflects they don&amp;#39;t like the rule</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="4.17">of law because they want</text>
  <text start="350.26" dur="5.31">to decide everything like a kangaroo</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s always one Queen of Hearts man you</text>
  <text start="355.57" dur="5.19">know it&amp;#39;s over you&amp;#39;re dead you&amp;#39;re guilty</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="5.13">no evidence necessary so the Democrats</text>
  <text start="360.76" dur="4.89">who used to just love process and</text>
  <text start="362.95" dur="5.37">procedure and the rule of law they are</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="4.65">literally subverting the rule of law in</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="5.01">what really amounts to a seditious</text>
  <text start="370.3" dur="5.28">attack on the government it really is</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="4.08">sedition do you know why they get away</text>
  <text start="375.58" dur="3.57">with this why they do this it really is</text>
  <text start="377.41" dur="5.45">the fault of the press the press enable</text>
  <text start="379.15" dur="3.71">yeah they can say anything they want</text>
  <text start="384.33" dur="4.66">I used to be a real paper they could</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="3.96">also be as corrupt as they want and they</text>
  <text start="388.99" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t get investigated right nobody</text>
  <text start="390.76" dur="5.4">cares nobody worries for years Obama had</text>
  <text start="394.6" dur="3.48">a pay-for-play operation in his</text>
  <text start="396.16" dur="3.33">administration that is disgusting and</text>
  <text start="398.08" dur="4.62">one of the reasons they&amp;#39;re fighting so</text>
  <text start="399.49" dur="5.16">hard if Biden comes out so does Clinton</text>
  <text start="402.7" dur="3.36">come out and about three others this</text>
  <text start="404.65" dur="3.6">goes right to the top of the Obama</text>
  <text start="406.06" dur="3.84">administration and and the</text>
  <text start="408.25" dur="2.96">administration decided to I didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="409.9" dur="3.39">scandals it&amp;#39;ll be the most</text>
  <text start="411.21" dur="3.88">scandal-ridden administration in our</text>
  <text start="413.29" dur="2.64">history Obama and Obama didn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="415.09" dur="2.31">about ethics</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="3.54">he didn&amp;#39;t care otherwise wouldn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s right a vice president should</text>
  <text start="419.47" dur="3.09">have been stopped from doing this by a</text>
  <text start="421.06" dur="3.96">president who had the slightest bit of</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="5.25">integrity but a Chicago paw like Obama</text>
  <text start="425.02" dur="4.26">pay-for-play eight times millions of</text>
  <text start="427.81" dur="6.81">dollars for your vice president and</text>
  <text start="429.28" dur="7.44">hundreds of millions for you all right</text>
  <text start="434.62" dur="4.83">well stay there this is a special like a</text>
  <text start="436.72" dur="5.4">special so there you have it from Joe</text>
  <text start="439.45" dur="5.25">and Rudy they just tore open the whole</text>
  <text start="442.12" dur="5.52">thing they just pulled out Adam ships</text>
  <text start="444.7" dur="5.19">bluff and kind of exposed the whole</text>
  <text start="447.64" dur="4.62">thing is just being a farce and comical</text>
  <text start="449.89" dur="6.03">if it wasn&amp;#39;t doing so much damage to our</text>
  <text start="452.26" dur="6.75">country now I also want to bring in some</text>
  <text start="455.92" dur="5.67">rumor mongering here I guess but the</text>
  <text start="459.01" dur="5.33">political rumors is that Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="461.59" dur="7.17">is going to run again for president I</text>
  <text start="464.34" dur="7.99">know it&amp;#39;ll be funny though now on the</text>
  <text start="468.76" dur="5.22">other hand you know it could have just</text>
  <text start="472.33" dur="2.82">been you know I mentioned this last</text>
  <text start="473.98" dur="2.79">weekend could have just been she was</text>
  <text start="475.15" dur="3.06">gonna go try to to do the whole</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="3.36">impeachment witch-hunt and try to</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="5.429">campaign basically on the impeachment</text>
  <text start="480.13" dur="6.21">and you know I was right in part</text>
  <text start="483.639" dur="4.161">that and the other potential was always</text>
  <text start="486.34" dur="3.99">that she was gonna re-enter the race</text>
  <text start="487.8" dur="5.44">possibly with Warren possibly on her own</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="4.589">and you know a while back he came out</text>
  <text start="493.24" dur="4.799">that she was kind of coaching Warren on</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="6.24">the back end so this just seems to be</text>
  <text start="498.039" dur="4.741">another trend and unfortunately or</text>
  <text start="501.159" dur="3.391">fortunately I don&amp;#39;t know because really</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="4.8">what its gonna do is unite the whole</text>
  <text start="504.55" dur="6.299">country against her it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="507.58" dur="5.399">like the bad guy central figure in a</text>
  <text start="510.849" dur="3.75">sense because people don&amp;#39;t know as much</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="3.42">about Soros they don&amp;#39;t know as much</text>
  <text start="514.599" dur="4.23">about all the intricacies but they know</text>
  <text start="516.399" dur="4.02">hillary clinton&amp;#39;s evil and they they can</text>
  <text start="518.829" dur="3.84">kind of sense that pretty innately i</text>
  <text start="520.419" dur="4.801">think so it&amp;#39;s gonna be great that this</text>
  <text start="522.669" dur="5.16">wildly unpopular candidate who cannot</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="6.33">even fill a stadium maybe not even a</text>
  <text start="527.829" dur="4.891">gymnasium will be running against and of</text>
  <text start="531.55" dur="5.159">course they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll push her to the</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="6.27">top spot the primary in and of course</text>
  <text start="536.709" dur="4.231">continuing on here we have other points</text>
  <text start="538.99" dur="4.26">on that trend watch we have hillary</text>
  <text start="540.94" dur="5.579">clinton teasing a 2020 run saying she</text>
  <text start="543.25" dur="8.399">can obviously be trump again let&amp;#39;s check</text>
  <text start="546.519" dur="6.69">this out brie this morning so maybe</text>
  <text start="551.649" dur="3.361">there doesn&amp;#39;t need to be a rematch i</text>
  <text start="553.209" dur="4.281">mean obviously i can beat them again but</text>
  <text start="555.01" dur="4.92">you know just</text>
  <text start="557.49" dur="4.9">so you know obviously she didn&amp;#39;t beat</text>
  <text start="559.93" dur="4.62">him the first time remember you guys</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="5.04">that she basically won the illegal vote</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="8.13">that&amp;#39;s not really winning the vote and</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="7.56">of course Trump won by a landslide so it</text>
  <text start="572.68" dur="3.93">wasn&amp;#39;t as though she actually won she</text>
  <text start="574.99" dur="3.27">she didn&amp;#39;t even really win the popular</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="4.44">vote when you consider all of the</text>
  <text start="578.26" dur="5.13">illegal votes tallied in and there there</text>
  <text start="581.05" dur="4.83">have been you know you studies done</text>
  <text start="583.39" dur="5.64">about this now to verify this and and</text>
  <text start="585.88" dur="5.58">many millions of voters were illegal</text>
  <text start="589.03" dur="5.49">votes in that election so she&amp;#39;s joking</text>
  <text start="591.46" dur="6.59">obviously and the electoral vote is what</text>
  <text start="594.52" dur="6.35">really counts and you lost badly so</text>
  <text start="598.05" dur="6.06">anyway just wanted to put that out there</text>
  <text start="600.87" dur="3.24">continuing on</text>
