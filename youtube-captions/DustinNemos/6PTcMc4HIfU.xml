  <text start="54.59" dur="6.789">old houseboat and are about to move to</text>

  <text start="61.379" dur="5.071">know Dustin how on earth you got the</text>

  <text start="69.479" dur="4.71">place where you put your feet on the</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="6.059">ground and that step into an old shaky</text>
  <text start="74.189" dur="5.281">boat how did this happen to come about</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="5.371">how did you spot this and why are you</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="5.939">rebuilding it why don&amp;#39;t you it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="82.53" dur="5.85">a recent thing it faced and yet it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="4.231">kind of an old project and a lot of what</text>
  <text start="88.38" dur="3.989">led me to even doing the work I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="89.64" dur="5.31">was a desire for freedom and</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="4.29">independence and that kind of eventually</text>
  <text start="94.95" dur="4.77">led me to take an interest in things</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="5.491">like homesteading and DIY and I taught</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="5.039">myself the basics of construction and</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="4.74">electric work I was planning to do my</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="4.5">own house but I found now that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="3.78">lot more freedom and less regulation on</text>
  <text start="109.259" dur="4.29">a houseboat and you can get a pretty</text>
  <text start="110.67" dur="4.53">good deal I&amp;#39;m not as interested in the</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="3.481">boat part and I don&amp;#39;t really know the</text>
  <text start="115.2" dur="4.14">boat part of it as well the house part</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;ve got down and as for that it sort of</text>
  <text start="119.34" dur="4.8">sweet deal it&amp;#39;s basically a free house</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="4.71">and the boat part works I just need to</text>

  <text start="967.99" dur="4.839">now I presume that he lost the trial and</text>
  <text start="971.209" dur="3.271">I presumed that all the media was</text>
  <text start="972.829" dur="4.26">correct when they said the guy was a</text>
  <text start="974.48" dur="5.7">fool and it was an egomaniac and he was</text>

  <text start="998.87" dur="6.329">the government and the media kept</text>
  <text start="1002.68" dur="5.37">getting in his way and putting him down</text>
  <text start="1005.199" dur="5.281">and I kept saying to my friends you know</text>
  <text start="1008.05" dur="4.56">if the guy has nothing it&amp;#39;s been almost</text>
  <text start="1010.48" dur="4.38">two years why would they get out as well</text>
  <text start="1012.61" dur="6.39">and go into a courtroom and fall in his</text>
  <text start="1014.86" dur="7.169">face he got on The Tonight Show and in</text>
  <text start="1019" dur="5.73">1968 and he said exactly that and that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1139.6" dur="4.92">away with it you don&amp;#39;t see me on</text>
  <text start="1140.98" dur="7.47">prime-time television so we booked him</text>
  <text start="1144.52" dur="6.51">and I was fired and he was cancelled but</text>

  <text start="1184.63" dur="4.56">the rumble cedar and the pool table or</text>
  <text start="1187.03" dur="5.279">in the bedroom or wherever to concede me</text>

  <text start="1201.37" dur="2.49">story</text>
  <text start="1201.82" dur="4.56">but that is in the book but all the</text>
  <text start="1203.86" dur="6.69">stuff about Harrison and the movie is</text>
  <text start="1206.38" dur="5.97">just a small sidebar to the book now</text>
  <text start="1210.55" dur="4.95">even though it&amp;#39;s unbelievably</text>
  <text start="1212.35" dur="6.96">interesting and compelling it is Desai</text>
  <text start="1215.5" dur="7.56">sidebar to the book so I feel totally</text>
  <text start="1219.31" dur="6.42">blessed in that respect that I&amp;#39;ve had</text>

  <text start="1815.339" dur="4.94">somebody broke into his office and stole</text>
  <text start="1817.289" dur="6.71">those computers and they were lost and</text>
  <text start="1820.279" dur="8.26">somehow someone heard about it</text>
  <text start="1823.999" dur="8.831">anonymously and anonymously sent me the</text>
  <text start="1828.539" dur="7.02">67 boxes so I had them and I was just</text>
  <text start="1832.83" dur="4.799">sitting on them and doing nothing about</text>
  <text start="1835.559" dur="5.761">it because I was hoping the president</text>
  <text start="1837.629" dur="5.67">Trump would get some of the CIA a just</text>
  <text start="1841.32" dur="3.779">say you know release these files and he</text>
  <text start="1843.299" dur="5.22">pushed them to release the files he</text>
  <text start="1845.099" dur="7.32">tried if yes he tried but he caved</text>
  <text start="1848.519" dur="5.51">because they said national security we</text>
  <text start="1852.419" dur="5.161">cannot do it because it jeopardizes</text>
  <text start="1854.029" dur="6.28">national security so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="1857.58" dur="6.479">that stayed but we know he tried and the</text>
  <text start="1860.309" dur="6.03">other reason we know is he tried his one</text>
  <text start="1864.059" dur="5.701">of his very close friends and advisers</text>
  <text start="1866.339" dur="6.901">was Roger stone mm-hmm now you know</text>
  <text start="1869.76" dur="5.49">Roger stone was scheduled to be my</text>
  <text start="1873.24" dur="3.81">guests a few months ago and sadly</text>
  <text start="1875.25" dur="3.24">something happened to his plane and he</text>
  <text start="1877.05" dur="3.96">couldn&amp;#39;t make it I&amp;#39;ve been trying to get</text>
  <text start="1878.49" dur="5.16">him as well yeah well rot rot you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1881.01" dur="5.88">written a book saying that LBJ is</text>
  <text start="1883.65" dur="6.87">heavily involved in this murder yeah if</text>
  <text start="1886.89" dur="7.11">if Roger believe that can you imagine</text>
  <text start="1890.52" dur="6.02">the kind of private conversations he</text>
  <text start="1894" dur="5.55">must have had with President Trump</text>
  <text start="1896.54" dur="8.44">off-the-record about the assassination</text>
  <text start="1899.55" dur="7.61">so I promise you president Trump has a</text>
  <text start="1904.98" dur="5.31">lot more knowledge about the</text>
  <text start="1907.16" dur="5.38">assassination and what went on that he</text>
  <text start="1910.29" dur="4.32">is able to make public for whatever</text>
  <text start="1912.54" dur="3.57">reason it is mine it is my position that</text>
  <text start="1914.61" dur="3.63">they have and I did a video to cover</text>
  <text start="1916.11" dur="4.8">this you know the left in general but a</text>
  <text start="1918.24" dur="5.31">lot the deep state you know has tried to</text>
  <text start="1920.91" dur="4.17">take him out multiple times already well</text>
  <text start="1923.55" dur="4.44">we can see that that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1925.08" dur="4.23">entirely obvious he&amp;#39;s not only aware of</text>
  <text start="1927.99" dur="2.7">the history I imagine you mean his</text>
  <text start="1929.31" dur="3.42">family&amp;#39;s intertwined with theirs but</text>
  <text start="1930.69" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s on guard for this to happen</text>
  <text start="1932.73" dur="5.79">again and that&amp;#39;s the thing that I think</text>
  <text start="1934.44" dur="5.94">is really exciting about him America</text>
  <text start="1938.52" dur="3.81">will never be the same since the</text>
  <text start="1940.38" dur="5.64">election of Donald Trump and I pointed</text>
  <text start="1942.33" dur="5.58">did this I had a friend because I think</text>
  <text start="1946.02" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s all Russia&amp;#39;s thing is absolute</text>
  <text start="1947.91" dur="4.68">nonsense I don&amp;#39;t know of any Russian</text>
  <text start="1949.77" dur="5.7">American citizens who vote who voted for</text>
  <text start="1952.59" dur="5.22">Donald Trump right I mean that is total</text>
  <text start="1955.47" dur="8.58">nonsense that the Russians did this but</text>
  <text start="1957.81" dur="9.09">you know two things my friend who likes</text>
  <text start="1964.05" dur="4.83">President Trump in some respects he said</text>
  <text start="1966.9" dur="4.14">well you know one of the reasons they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1968.88" dur="4.65">after him is because supposedly he was</text>
  <text start="1971.04" dur="4.32">negotiating for a Trump Tower in Moscow</text>
  <text start="1973.53" dur="4.53">or something like that and he&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="1975.36" dur="5.52">pursuing it after he&amp;#39;s elected and I</text>
  <text start="1978.06" dur="5.34">said to him so what at least it is out</text>
  <text start="1980.88" dur="5.13">of the open I said look at Harry Reid</text>
  <text start="1983.4" dur="4.95">here in Nevada look at Lyndon Baines</text>
  <text start="1986.01" dur="4.77">Johnson and I can point out to you</text>
  <text start="1988.35" dur="5.85">dozens and dozens of senators and</text>
  <text start="1990.78" dur="7.32">congressmen who went into office poor</text>
  <text start="1994.2" dur="5.7">and they come out mega millionaires even</text>
  <text start="1998.1" dur="3.56">though history now knows that they were</text>
  <text start="1999.9" dur="4.25">poor politicians</text>
  <text start="2001.66" dur="5.31">and a cooler public servants I said at</text>
  <text start="2004.15" dur="4.65">least with Donald Trump it was out in</text>
  <text start="2006.97" dur="4.07">the open I said the other thing is you</text>
  <text start="2008.8" dur="6.45">know everybody&amp;#39;s talking about how</text>
  <text start="2011.04" dur="6.61">elections are rigged to me the greatest</text>

  <text start="2035.2" dur="4.26">Kennedys had me at break them into a</text>
  <text start="2037.21" dur="3.96">thousand splinters or however they</text>
  <text start="2039.46" dur="5.82">phrased it yeah this is the Central</text>
  <text start="2041.17" dur="6.21">Intelligence actually he&amp;#39;s on record</text>
  <text start="2045.28" dur="4.23">yeah there was a young man I had on my</text>
  <text start="2047.38" dur="4.41">show wrote an unbelievable book called</text>

  <text start="2051.79" dur="5.82">Fulton the inheritance it is about the</text>
  <text start="2054.73" dur="4.23">watch that John Kennedy was wearing when</text>
  <text start="2057.61" dur="4.11">he was shot that was recovered</text>
  <text start="2058.96" dur="4.26">accidentally by a security guard turned</text>
  <text start="2061.72" dur="4.38">over to Robert Kennedy and Robert</text>
  <text start="2063.22" dur="6">Kennedy ran forensic tests on it that</text>
  <text start="2066.1" dur="5.7">had mercury on it which proved that Lee</text>
  <text start="2069.22" dur="5.16">Harvey Oswald did not fire the shot so</text>
  <text start="2071.8" dur="4.65">the book is about the adventure of that</text>
  <text start="2074.38" dur="4.59">watch and it ended up in the possession</text>
  <text start="2076.45" dur="4.59">of Christopher Fulton who was sent to</text>
  <text start="2078.97" dur="4.199">prison for eight years he is a guest</text>
  <text start="2081.04" dur="4.65">that you must have on your show the book</text>

  <text start="2085.69" dur="6.92">the contact information for Christopher</text>
  <text start="2088.78" dur="7.26">so in any event what happened was that</text>
  <text start="2092.61" dur="5.65">nothing happened with the Central</text>
  <text start="2096.04" dur="6.36">Intelligence Agency releasing the files</text>
  <text start="2098.26" dur="6.06">and in the film the American media and</text>
  <text start="2102.4" dur="3.57">the second assassin ation of President</text>
  <text start="2104.32" dur="4.95">John F Kennedy which is doing</text>
  <text start="2105.97" dur="7.62">gangbusters by the way the two most</text>
  <text start="2109.27" dur="6.96">important files accidentally released by</text>
  <text start="2113.59" dur="5.19">the CIA or maybe release by somebody who</text>
  <text start="2116.23" dur="6.48">wanted the truth out there is a file</text>
  <text start="2118.78" dur="5.97">from the CIA dated in 1967 after the</text>
  <text start="2122.71" dur="4.8">arrest of Clay Shaw and it says we must</text>
  <text start="2124.75" dur="4.23">supply legal help to Clay Shaw otherwise</text>
  <text start="2127.51" dur="4.5">Jim Garrison is going to get a</text>
  <text start="2128.98" dur="3.65">conviction of him for conspiracy in the</text>
  <text start="2132.01" dur="3.54">murder</text>
  <text start="2132.63" dur="4.48">that proves complicity</text>
  <text start="2135.55" dur="3.45">doesn&amp;#39;t prove they killed them but it</text>
  <text start="2137.11" dur="4.14">proves complicity and then of course</text>
  <text start="2139" dur="6.03">after Mark Lane published rush to</text>
  <text start="2141.25" dur="5.51">judgment and Herald Weisberg and and may</text>
  <text start="2145.03" dur="4.589">breasts and a lot of these fabulous</text>
  <text start="2146.76" dur="4.9">researchers started sprouting the truth</text>
  <text start="2149.619" dur="4.891">of what really happened to John Kennedy</text>
  <text start="2151.66" dur="7.29">and Martin Luther King Malcolm X and</text>
  <text start="2154.51" dur="6.81">Robert Kennedy the CIA now proposes a</text>
  <text start="2158.95" dur="5.07">program to develop where they could</text>
  <text start="2161.32" dur="4.47">discredit what they call conspiracy</text>
  <text start="2164.02" dur="4.32">theorists you know</text>
  <text start="2165.79" dur="4.71">memos are in the film I would like to</text>
  <text start="2168.34" dur="4.59">add in and yes they&amp;#39;ve used that term to</text>
  <text start="2170.5" dur="4.5">try to demonize and and just tow us to</text>
  <text start="2172.93" dur="5.72">cast aside our arguments for a long time</text>
  <text start="2175" dur="6.24">but I would just like to add in that</text>
  <text start="2178.65" dur="4.63">it&amp;#39;s not working as well as it used to</text>
  <text start="2181.24" dur="3.36">this this conspiracy theorist term like</text>
  <text start="2183.28" dur="3.93">everyone doesn&amp;#39;t believe them anymore</text>
  <text start="2184.6" dur="4.65">and is that involved and it&amp;#39;s easy for</text>
  <text start="2187.21" dur="4.71">us to spot what did not really happen</text>
  <text start="2189.25" dur="4.44">well yeah the other thing that it no it</text>
  <text start="2191.92" dur="6.06">didn&amp;#39;t and that&amp;#39;s always really easy to</text>
  <text start="2193.69" dur="6.51">spot really I would say that 99% of all</text>
  <text start="2197.98" dur="4.23">Americans right now do not trust the</text>
  <text start="2200.2" dur="3.6">government for justifiable reason before</text>
  <text start="2202.21" dur="4.26">it might have been thirty percent of</text>
  <text start="2203.8" dur="4.71">forty percent yet now it&amp;#39;s a massive I</text>
  <text start="2206.47" dur="4.92">mean America is on the verge of civil</text>
  <text start="2208.51" dur="5.52">disobedience and and hopefully it will</text>
  <text start="2211.39" dur="4.26">happen because it&amp;#39;s constitutional even</text>
  <text start="2214.03" dur="3.87">if the government can&amp;#39;t remember that</text>
  <text start="2215.65" dur="5.7">there was a constitution but what I said</text>
  <text start="2217.9" dur="5.82">to my friend who was talking about that</text>
  <text start="2221.35" dur="4.11">the elections may be fixed and I said to</text>
  <text start="2223.72" dur="5.54">you to me the greatest president was</text>
  <text start="2225.46" dur="7.98">John Kennedy I have to admit that the</text>
  <text start="2229.26" dur="7.06">election of John Kennedy in 1960 was</text>
  <text start="2233.44" dur="5.73">fixed and part of it was fixed by the</text>
  <text start="2236.32" dur="5.46">Democratic machine of crooked machine of</text>
  <text start="2239.17" dur="5.97">Mayor Daley in Chicago and then the</text>
  <text start="2241.78" dur="6.17">Mafia and Sam Giancana Nannes changement</text>
  <text start="2245.14" dur="6.03">visiting the coal miners in Virginia</text>
  <text start="2247.95" dur="7.3">that was the slim percentage that got</text>
  <text start="2251.17" dur="6.06">John Kennedy into the White House now</text>
  <text start="2255.25" dur="4.619">the same thing happened with George Bush</text>
  <text start="2257.23" dur="4.47">in Florida well if there was to be</text>
  <text start="2259.869" dur="4.051">honest there was some mafia connections</text>
  <text start="2261.7" dur="4.409">to the Kennedy family right like they</text>
  <text start="2263.92" dur="5.399">but you don&amp;#39;t get to that level without</text>
  <text start="2266.109" dur="5.281">some level of connections at least</text>
  <text start="2269.319" dur="4.71">yeah well John Kennedy had an affair</text>
  <text start="2271.39" dur="5.04">with a girl named Judith Campbell sort</text>
  <text start="2274.029" dur="5.161">of a movie starlet who was also the</text>
  <text start="2276.43" dur="4.559">mistress to Sam Giancana so they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2279.19" dur="4.139">they used to deliver messages back and</text>
  <text start="2280.989" dur="3.63">forth there&amp;#39;s no question about it ago</text>
  <text start="2283.329" dur="4.051">against the deep state I would want the</text>
  <text start="2284.619" dur="5.13">Mafia on my side absolutely and look at</text>
  <text start="2287.38" dur="4.889">John Kennedy&amp;#39;s father I mean it was a</text>
  <text start="2289.749" dur="6.02">gangster he was a bootlegger that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="2292.269" dur="6.21">of the ways that he got he got wealthy I</text>
  <text start="2295.769" dur="4.901">remember Johnny and Mort Sahl telling me</text>
  <text start="2298.479" dur="4.171">that Mort Sahl he used to write jokes</text>
  <text start="2300.67" dur="4.139">for John Kennedy was on Air Force One</text>
  <text start="2302.65" dur="4.589">with John Kennedy one time and they were</text>
  <text start="2304.809" dur="4.111">sitting down having a drink John Kennedy</text>
  <text start="2307.239" dur="4.56">turned to Morton said Mort how much</text>
  <text start="2308.92" dur="4.289">money you think my father has and Mort</text>
  <text start="2311.799" dur="5.91">said I don&amp;#39;t know a couple of hundred</text>
  <text start="2313.209" dur="8.07">million and John Kennedy says he has 400</text>
  <text start="2317.709" dur="6.27">million and Mort Sahl said my god that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2321.279" dur="4.29">money and then John Kennedy smiled and</text>
  <text start="2323.979" dur="5.97">said no that&amp;#39;s not money</text>
  <text start="2325.569" dur="7.111">the Rockefellers have 400 billion more</text>
  <text start="2329.949" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s money and it was probably</text>
  <text start="2332.68" dur="4.95">somebody in the deed State Allen Dulles</text>
  <text start="2334.839" dur="4.5">obviously engineered the murder hired</text>
  <text start="2337.63" dur="5.01">the killers and all of the rest of it</text>
  <text start="2339.339" dur="6.811">but he&amp;#39;s an employee and while I never</text>
  <text start="2342.64" dur="5.639">said it in the film it was probably one</text>
  <text start="2346.15" dur="6.03">of the members of the ruling families</text>
  <text start="2348.279" dur="5.851">and it was probably April Harriman who</text>
  <text start="2352.18" dur="4.169">authorized the hit on John Kennedy</text>
  <text start="2354.13" dur="5.189">because he was an advisor to Kennedy and</text>
  <text start="2356.349" dur="4.89">he hated him and he was the one that</text>
  <text start="2359.319" dur="4.5">ordered the Central Intelligence Agency</text>
  <text start="2361.239" dur="6.27">three three weeks before Kennedy was</text>
  <text start="2363.819" dur="5.611">murdered to murder diem in Vietnam do</text>
  <text start="2367.509" dur="4.32">you think that LBJ had a part to play in</text>
  <text start="2369.43" dur="5.399">this like he was obviously a bad guy uh</text>
  <text start="2371.829" dur="5.13">if you look at the garrison files that</text>
  <text start="2374.829" dur="5.25">are released and I&amp;#39;m gonna put that on</text>
  <text start="2376.959" dur="4.89">pause a second I say the Jim Garrison</text>
  <text start="2380.079" dur="3.301">there&amp;#39;s a great picture there of Jim</text>
  <text start="2381.849" dur="4.95">Garrison with LBJ</text>
  <text start="2383.38" dur="5.489">always downplayed it because he had no</text>
  <text start="2386.799" dur="5.131">facts he had no witnesses and it was</text>
  <text start="2388.869" dur="5.821">just conjecture and conjecture leads to</text>
  <text start="2391.93" dur="4.74">criticism and he wanted no conjecture at</text>
  <text start="2394.69" dur="6.149">all he want a blue truth in his case</text>
  <text start="2396.67" dur="6.36">sure anybody in the files released there</text>
  <text start="2400.839" dur="5.011">is a book that</text>
  <text start="2403.03" dur="5.97">Jim Garrison saved 50 pages of the book</text>
  <text start="2405.85" dur="5.46">by a fella named walking just in a year</text>
  <text start="2409" dur="4.92">after the murder of John Kennedy walking</text>
  <text start="2411.31" dur="4.77">just then who was a German investigative</text>
  <text start="2413.92" dur="4.35">journalist very highly respected in</text>
  <text start="2416.08" dur="6.39">Europe went to Dallas and a year later</text>
  <text start="2418.27" dur="7.05">wrote Oswald assassin or fall guy proves</text>
  <text start="2422.47" dur="4.68">definitively definitively that Oswald</text>
  <text start="2425.32" dur="3.87">was not the shooter and this was a</text>
  <text start="2427.15" dur="6.36">couple of years before mark Lane wrote</text>
  <text start="2429.19" dur="9.3">to rush the judgment Joe Stan claims in</text>
  <text start="2433.51" dur="9.27">this book that the CIA the CIA needed</text>
  <text start="2438.49" dur="7.62">Lyndon Johnson to set up John Kennedy to</text>
  <text start="2442.78" dur="5.61">come to Dallas their attempts in Chicago</text>
  <text start="2446.11" dur="4.53">failed accidentally they failed</text>
  <text start="2448.39" dur="4.38">accidentally in Miami was in the</text>
  <text start="2450.64" dur="3.36">motorcade was interrupted he was flown</text>
  <text start="2452.77" dur="3.45">up by a helicopter</text>
  <text start="2454" dur="4.92">but as garrison says in the files</text>
  <text start="2456.22" dur="5.04">release and in the film he says that</text>
  <text start="2458.92" dur="4.95">Dallas was a no-risk operation first of</text>
  <text start="2461.26" dur="5.61">all the mayor Earl Campbell was a</text>
  <text start="2463.87" dur="4.73">brother of Charles Cabell who is Allen</text>
  <text start="2466.87" dur="4.68">Dulles is assistant</text>
  <text start="2468.6" dur="5.47">fired by John Kennedy after the</text>
  <text start="2471.55" dur="5.46">disastrous day of date so I feel like</text>
  <text start="2474.07" dur="6.81">garrison I cannot prove it but there you</text>
  <text start="2477.01" dur="8.78">have him according to these files just</text>
  <text start="2480.88" dur="8.97">us just walking Justin said in private</text>
  <text start="2485.79" dur="5.98">if you do not go to Dallas mr. Kennedy I</text>
  <text start="2489.85" dur="4.95">will see to it that you lose the</text>
  <text start="2491.77" dur="4.64">election he had no choice to go but</text>
  <text start="2494.8" dur="4.05">there were warning signs all over</text>
  <text start="2496.41" dur="4.6">governor Connally begged him not to go</text>
  <text start="2498.85" dur="4.59">there were representatives in Texas</text>
  <text start="2501.01" dur="4.83">begged him not to go but I want to say</text>
  <text start="2503.44" dur="6.15">one thing again about the elections that</text>
  <text start="2505.84" dur="6.03">are fixed George George Bush&amp;#39;s election</text>
  <text start="2509.59" dur="5.75">was fixed we knew there were no weapons</text>
  <text start="2511.87" dur="6.41">of mass destruction and sadly Muller was</text>
  <text start="2515.34" dur="5.89">one of those people with the FBI who</text>
  <text start="2518.28" dur="5.92">agreed with George Bush and so I have no</text>
  <text start="2521.23" dur="4.35">respect for him either so you had that</text>
  <text start="2524.2" dur="4.77">election fixed you want to know</text>
  <text start="2525.58" dur="5.75">something Dustin one election that you</text>
  <text start="2528.97" dur="5.85">can point to that was absolutely not</text>
  <text start="2531.33" dur="5.14">fixed was the election of Donald J Trump</text>
  <text start="2534.82" dur="3.9">yeah because</text>
  <text start="2536.47" dur="5.97">well we&amp;#39;ve caught them cheating on their</text>
  <text start="2538.72" dur="6.09">side in many cases but our side none you</text>
  <text start="2542.44" dur="4.5">can look at his face he&amp;#39;s as stunned as</text>
  <text start="2544.81" dur="4.5">anyone that he became President of the</text>
  <text start="2546.94" dur="4.88">United States because of you look at all</text>
  <text start="2549.31" dur="5.37">the mainstream media prior to that</text>
  <text start="2551.82" dur="5.17">Hillary Clinton is a slam dunk</text>
  <text start="2554.68" dur="3.81">and I want to add a point in here to</text>
  <text start="2556.99" dur="3.69">what you&amp;#39;re talking about with some of</text>
  <text start="2558.49" dur="3.72">these you know the conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="2560.68" dur="3.78">and how they&amp;#39;re using that against this</text>

  <text start="2865.19" dur="4.86">sort of bringing down just the</text>
  <text start="2867.38" dur="7.05">government it&amp;#39;s the question of bringing</text>

  <text start="2882.86" dur="5.13">murder of John Kennedy and he said I</text>
  <text start="2885.53" dur="4.35">think what has got to be done is exactly</text>
  <text start="2887.99" dur="5.46">what President Trump is doing it is</text>
  <text start="2889.88" dur="6.21">pulling out the pieces one piece at a</text>

  <text start="2901.55" dur="4.05">over culture slipping in and you know</text>
  <text start="2903.5" dur="4.65">therein lies their their loss of</text>
  <text start="2905.6" dur="5.94">political power down the road but on the</text>
  <text start="2908.15" dur="5.04">other hand I just you know I want to add</text>
  <text start="2911.54" dur="3.21">in there for folks who don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="2913.19" dur="2.97">anything going you got to keep track of</text>
  <text start="2914.75" dur="3.84">some of these Sylvan documents and such</text>
  <text start="2916.16" dur="5.49">and there is a lot happening behind the</text>

  <text start="2921.65" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t give up or think nothing is being</text>
  <text start="2923.66" dur="5.55">done by any means and I&amp;#39;m glad to see</text>
  <text start="2925.37" dur="6.96">that he agrees with me on that again I</text>
  <text start="2929.21" dur="5.64">look at you and I think how lucky your</text>
  <text start="2932.33" dur="4.95">wife and your little girl are to have a</text>
  <text start="2934.85" dur="5.54">father like that I mean because</text>
  <text start="2937.28" dur="5.93">you know what the garrison children</text>
  <text start="2940.39" dur="7.39">while they were enormous helps when I</text>
  <text start="2943.21" dur="8.17">made the original garrison tapes they</text>
  <text start="2947.78" dur="5.91">had sort of backed up uneven talking</text>
  <text start="2951.38" dur="5.25">about their father because their lives</text>
  <text start="2953.69" dur="6.3">were made very very tough because of</text>
  <text start="2956.63" dur="6.6">what their their father did and he did</text>
  <text start="2959.99" dur="7.38">it for history and eventually history</text>
  <text start="2963.23" dur="8.64">will prove him right and as I say in</text>
  <text start="2967.37" dur="8.4">closing of the garrison files is that</text>
  <text start="2971.87" dur="7.29">his gravestone says let justice be done</text>
  <text start="2975.77" dur="5.49">though the heavens fall and I think his</text>
  <text start="2979.16" dur="5.46">gravestone will see that eventually</text>
  <text start="2981.26" dur="7.05">happen and I also conclude by saying</text>
  <text start="2984.62" dur="6.09">that my I personally and I guess folks</text>
  <text start="2988.31" dur="3.92">like yourself find there are just scores</text>
  <text start="2990.71" dur="5.79">and scores of people and organizations</text>
  <text start="2992.23" dur="6.61">out there that deserves to fall we hope</text>
  <text start="2996.5" dur="5.48">it&amp;#39;s not a painful fall but you know it</text>
  <text start="2998.84" dur="6.06">may wait very well it may very well be</text>
  <text start="3001.98" dur="4.57">extremely painful living with any</text>

  <text start="3006.55" dur="3.45">any of them will end up being but living</text>
  <text start="3008.62" dur="3.12">within a government like that we are</text>
  <text start="3010" dur="4.92">forced to tell ourselves certain lies</text>
  <text start="3011.74" dur="6.03">lest we are responsible for changing the</text>
