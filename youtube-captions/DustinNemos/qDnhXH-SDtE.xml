  <text start="179.16" dur="3.75">impeachment if you hold on to these</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="6.63">articles for too long I said I was going</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="6.54">to say Nancy we are we have I when we</text>
  <text start="187.44" dur="3.6">bring the bill which is just so you know</text>
  <text start="189.45" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s a bill made in order by the</text>
  <text start="191.04" dur="4.529">rules committee that we can call up at</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="6.18">any time in order to send it over to the</text>
  <text start="195.569" dur="5.161">Senate and to have as provisions in</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="6.06">there to pay for the profit for the</text>
  <text start="200.73" dur="8.49">impeachment and then the next step is</text>
  <text start="204.93" dur="8.22">the caller came to whatever you want to</text>
  <text start="209.22" dur="7.47">call it they just the trial that is</text>
  <text start="213.15" dur="5.489">where you put the manager I was not</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="4.08">prepared to put the managers and not</text>
  <text start="218.639" dur="5.131">bill yet because we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="220.77" dur="4.83">the arena that we are in frankly I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="223.77" dur="4.71">care what every public thing any other</text>
  <text start="225.6" dur="4.77">not owned I said it I said this is it</text>

  <text start="230.37" dur="3.84">we have to pass the bill before you can</text>
  <text start="232.02" dur="4.83">see what&amp;#39;s in it moments but in this</text>
  <text start="234.21" dur="4.47">case she&amp;#39;s basically just saying we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.85" dur="3.96">not we&amp;#39;re kind of delaying about sending</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="4.2">this to the Senate because we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="3.6">the turf we don&amp;#39;t know how they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="242.88" dur="4.41">react we don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re gonna let</text>
  <text start="244.41" dur="4.35">us have a cheat when like we did over</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="2.76">here in the house we don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re gonna hold us to an actual</text>
  <text start="250.05" dur="3.57">standard trial which is unacceptable</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="5.13">because we have no evidence that kind of</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="6.81">thing so they&amp;#39;re trying to get a promise</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="6.3">of a rigged game before they even go in</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="6.21">and frankly it&amp;#39;s part of war you guys</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="5.46">know I&amp;#39;m a big fan of Sun Tzu&amp;#39;s Art of</text>
  <text start="266.64" dur="3.96">War and the concept behind the art of</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="4.29">war and living your life in a tactical</text>
  <text start="270.6" dur="4.65">manner President Trump obviously a big</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="5.04">fan of art of war he wrote his own art</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="5.67">of war book so you guys know the art of</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="5.79">the deal heck I even wrote a part of my</text>
  <text start="280.92" dur="5.64">own part of war book which I kind of</text>
  <text start="283.89" dur="4.32">jokingly call a qyn on art of war book</text>
  <text start="286.56" dur="3.24">because it really is a great red pill</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="3.3">book to pass out to your friends and</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="3.54">family and if of course I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="4.05">about the best-selling Q book which</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="4.41">triggered the mainstream media and Alex</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="4.44">Jones and everyone else a collaborative</text>
  <text start="297.75" dur="4.26">work of some of the top Q researchers</text>
  <text start="300" dur="5.19">out there like myself and you can get</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="4.95">that at the book of queuing on.com if</text>
  <text start="305.19" dur="4.05">you go to the book of Q and on Comm</text>
  <text start="306.96" dur="4.26">slash invite you actually get to check</text>
  <text start="309.24" dur="3.9">out some of the Q book authors</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="4.2">interviews which it&amp;#39;s like a virtual</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="4.32">book tour we&amp;#39;re doing just this week and</text>
  <text start="315.42" dur="4.08">you can get those completely free check</text>
  <text start="317.46" dur="4.11">them out I think you&amp;#39;ll enjoy some of</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="4.41">those interviews were very interesting</text>
  <text start="321.57" dur="3.96">if you&amp;#39;re a big Q person or interested</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="5.4">in the book itself or the people behind</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="5.4">the book so continuing on you know</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="3.63">obviously they&amp;#39;re looking for a rigged</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="4.77">game and the reason that I bring up the</text>
  <text start="332.94" dur="4.89">art of war is in the art of war one of</text>
  <text start="335.7" dur="3.57">the tactics or one of the sort of the</text>
  <text start="337.83" dur="5.07">methodologies that you would always</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="5.94">follow is to always know your enemy</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="3.96">right and if you know your enemy and you</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="3.87">know yourself you need not fear a</text>
  <text start="346.86" dur="4.32">thousand battles so she&amp;#39;s actually being</text>
  <text start="349.08" dur="5.41">really smart here her enemy right now is</text>
  <text start="351.18" dur="5.56">the Senate and she wants victory before</text>
  <text start="354.49" dur="4.32">like that&amp;#39;s a very important concept and</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="4.859">I&amp;#39;ve used that concept myself in the</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="5.25">past actually I used it to make this</text>
  <text start="361.599" dur="4.171">book a best-selling novel not novel but</text>
  <text start="364.06" dur="5.039">a best-selling red pill art of war book</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="5.82">on Amazon where 99 point something</text>
  <text start="369.099" dur="5.341">percent of all books are sold how did I</text>
  <text start="371.59" dur="4.74">do that I snuck up on these bastards I</text>
  <text start="374.44" dur="3.99">snuck up on big tech I snuck up on</text>
  <text start="376.33" dur="4.32">Amazon I didn&amp;#39;t really tell him what I</text>
  <text start="378.43" dur="5.22">was doing and then all of us together</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="4.65">where we go one week a wall told the</text>
  <text start="383.65" dur="2.73">world about the Q book and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="3.03">know what was coming they didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="386.38" dur="4.74">what hit them it was a shock a surprise</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="5.19">attack that&amp;#39;s how we had victory before</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="3.84">striking them we knew that I knew that</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="4.53">it was gonna be a best-seller because</text>
  <text start="394.96" dur="5.16">between our total cumulative audiences</text>
  <text start="398.05" dur="3.959">people that are really big into the Q</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="3.87">movement that that wanted something like</text>
  <text start="402.009" dur="5.821">this anyway I mean I had many requests</text>
  <text start="403.99" dur="8.04">for for writing a book they were out</text>
  <text start="407.83" dur="7.579">there already you know kind of wanting</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="5.46">to see this happen okay so when I</text>
  <text start="415.409" dur="3.641">sometimes I have to stop and start and</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="3.479">you&amp;#39;ll see my video just kind of blink</text>
  <text start="419.05" dur="3.72">over even though it&amp;#39;s the same video</text>
  <text start="420.969" dur="3.57">because I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll put the two clips</text>
  <text start="422.77" dur="3.929">together sometimes my dogs will push</text>
  <text start="424.539" dur="4.831">open my office door here I&amp;#39;m I work from</text>
  <text start="426.699" dur="4.381">home sometimes my 21 month old toddler</text>
  <text start="429.37" dur="3.72">will push in and say hey to major in</text>
  <text start="431.08" dur="3.869">breakfast and I think she&amp;#39;s due to wake</text>
  <text start="433.09" dur="3.69">up in about two minutes anyway so she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.949" dur="3.241">a little bit early anyway and now</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re just they come see me in the</text>
  <text start="438.19" dur="3.719">mornings so a lot of times I do my</text>
  <text start="440.349" dur="3.151">recording in the mornings when I have</text>
  <text start="441.909" dur="4.861">full information from the night before</text>
  <text start="443.5" dur="5.31">all of that together anyway so kind of</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="5.19">continuing on here sorry about that my</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="5.009">point being that we kind of understood</text>
  <text start="451.96" dur="3.9">that there was a little bit of a victory</text>
  <text start="453.819" dur="4.201">before striking with the cue book</text>
  <text start="455.86" dur="3.54">because we had a large audience of</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="3.329">people that we could tell all at once</text>
  <text start="459.4" dur="3.389">and sneak up on them they didn&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="461.349" dur="3.271">coming and then later of course they</text>
  <text start="462.789" dur="4.081">mess with the book and they they dropped</text>
  <text start="464.62" dur="4.049">a lot of a certified reviews hundreds to</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="3.389">keep us from hitting number one but</text>
  <text start="468.669" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s fine I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="470.259" dur="4.41">had a victory before strike and that</text>
  <text start="472.719" dur="3.69">concept victory before strike is an</text>
  <text start="474.669" dur="3.571">important part of the art of war you</text>
  <text start="476.409" dur="4.681">never want to attack anyone unless you</text>
  <text start="478.24" dur="4.62">know already before you even lift your</text>
  <text start="481.09" dur="3.509">finger that you have won that battle</text>
  <text start="482.86" dur="4.14">now that&amp;#39;s something that President</text>
  <text start="484.599" dur="3.121">Trump has often done and we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="487" dur="2.91">happen in</text>
  <text start="487.72" dur="4.65">act where if he makes a move he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.91" dur="5.04">already thought ahead four or five six</text>
  <text start="492.37" dur="4.77">steps and outsmarted them and if they</text>
  <text start="494.95" dur="5.04">react to his move it just digs into the</text>
  <text start="497.14" dur="4.41">trap even more okay this is the kind of</text>
  <text start="499.99" dur="3.54">thing where the more you struggle the</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="4.47">worse it gets it&amp;#39;s like quicksand that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="503.53" dur="3.93">President Trump to the deep state the</text>
  <text start="506.02" dur="3.93">more they squirm</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="7.459">the faster they sink so anyway</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="7.8">continuing on we also have let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="514.919" dur="4.091">puppet following orders absolutely I</text>
  <text start="517.75" dur="3.27">know I went a little bit long on that</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="3.33">but you know we have to plug the book</text>
  <text start="521.02" dur="2.97">for this show we have to plug the</text>
  <text start="522.34" dur="3.66">sponsors for the show to make this even</text>
  <text start="523.99" dur="3.48">possible in the first place you know</text>
  <text start="526" dur="2.97">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s quite a few people that</text>
  <text start="527.47" dur="3.39">have been covering independent media</text>
  <text start="528.97" dur="4.08">that don&amp;#39;t do it anymore because they</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="4.02">have been wiped out or decimated or or</text>
  <text start="533.05" dur="3.84">unable to support their families the way</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="4.44">that they used to you know honestly</text>
  <text start="536.89" dur="4.41">because they lost their sponsors they</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="3.9">lost their ads on YouTube YouTube took</text>
  <text start="541.3" dur="4.32">away their monetization after they had</text>
  <text start="543.22" dur="4.59">built up help helping build YouTube of</text>
  <text start="545.62" dur="5.19">itself but built up a large following</text>
  <text start="547.81" dur="4.62">that you know in some cases yeah</text>
  <text start="550.81" dur="4.29">I don&amp;#39;t make much money on YouTube folks</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="4.83">but I should write as a hundred thousand</text>

  <text start="670.459" dur="7.38">let me close my camera they can only</text>
  <text start="674.48" dur="7.32">vote for impeachment then the Senate</text>

  <text start="721.1" dur="5.64">retweeted this guy who has a Q ni q + so</text>
  <text start="724.88" dur="3.179">that&amp;#39;s an important little one of those</text>
  <text start="726.74" dur="4.709">little Q proofs right there because</text>
  <text start="728.059" dur="6.481">Trump knows about Q he could not know</text>
  <text start="731.449" dur="4.801">about Q everyone knows about Q and we we</text>
  <text start="734.54" dur="4.38">know he knows about Q because he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="736.25" dur="4.199">asked about it in the past the IP and</text>
  <text start="738.92" dur="3.75">non asked him about it privately behind</text>

  <text start="747.259" dur="3.151">know he said they were good people</text>
  <text start="748.189" dur="6.09">things like that he&amp;#39;s been interviewed</text>
  <text start="750.41" dur="6.839">about it he can look that up so Donald</text>
  <text start="754.279" dur="4.17">we tweeted this Q person on Twitter and</text>
  <text start="757.249" dur="3.721">this isn&amp;#39;t the first time he&amp;#39;s done that</text>
  <text start="758.449" dur="4.411">I think he was then suspended for it cuz</text>
  <text start="760.97" dur="3.929">usually if Donald Trump reshares</text>
  <text start="762.86" dur="3.599">somebody that somehow that violated</text>

  <text start="773.93" dur="6.99">little pick-me-up so that&amp;#39;s really cool</text>
  <text start="777.379" dur="5.88">and I also made a point of this to ask</text>
  <text start="780.92" dur="5.94">on Twitter and I think Zack Voorhees or</text>
  <text start="783.259" dur="5.13">no not Zack or he&amp;#39;s um one of the people</text>
  <text start="786.86" dur="4.32">that was tweeted by Q I can&amp;#39;t remember</text>

  <text start="810.079" dur="4.081">happening weekly that is going to be</text>

  <text start="816.11" dur="3.779">right they don&amp;#39;t get the usual kind of</text>
  <text start="818.089" dur="4.17">nuance or mathematical probability</text>
  <text start="819.889" dur="5.43">obvious but they will certainly get the</text>

  <text start="845.629" dur="4.621">other stuff it&amp;#39;s going to be really</text>
