  <text start="263.94" dur="6.09">course because they fear the truth now</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="5.97">of course that in that time we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="5.22">largely succeeded an accused mandate</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="5.15">what he told us to do was break the msn</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="4.95">break the fake news and we have</text>
  <text start="277.49" dur="4.6">beautifully with Trump&amp;#39;s help of course</text>
  <text start="280.2" dur="3.75">always shouting fake news and then he</text>
  <text start="282.09" dur="3.84">kicks it to us and alternative media and</text>
  <text start="283.95" dur="4.32">we prove the case where we argue the</text>
  <text start="285.93" dur="4.41">case and with the facts and then they</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="3.12">are exposed because they&amp;#39;re not the only</text>
  <text start="290.34" dur="3.45">game in town anymore</text>
  <text start="291.39" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s what Q says when he means when he</text>
  <text start="293.79" dur="5.01">says that you were the news now and</text>
  <text start="295.41" dur="5.58">treat with care now the agency&amp;#39;s posture</text>
  <text start="298.8" dur="3.69">toward the media is basically defensive</text>
  <text start="300.99" dur="2.69">let&amp;#39;s check this one out</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="5.97">okay that didn&amp;#39;t make it any bigger</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="6.85">nevermind see the agency&amp;#39;s posture</text>
  <text start="308.46" dur="4.62">toward the media this is the CIA talking</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="5.449">points this was classified and it is</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="6">their reaction to media right to</text>
  <text start="315.979" dur="4.78">controversy in that allegations the</text>
  <text start="319.08" dur="3.39">agency&amp;#39;s posture toward the media is</text>
  <text start="320.759" dur="4.651">basically defensive reactive and</text>
  <text start="322.47" dur="5.669">tongue-tied what we say is no comment</text>
  <text start="325.41" dur="5.4">that disclosure was wrong and outrageous</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="4.381">next we wring our hands send emissaries</text>
  <text start="330.81" dur="4.32">out to brief key people in the</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="5.1">administration and Congress and correct</text>
  <text start="335.13" dur="5.25">the record then hunker back awaiting the</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="5.22">next blow maybe it&amp;#39;s time for an offense</text>
  <text start="340.38" dur="5.37">as well as a defense and an attempt to</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="5.28">get things in better balance what does</text>
  <text start="345.75" dur="4.02">that mean I know what that means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.12" dur="4.41">gonna use the power of the CIA against</text>

  <text start="358.259" dur="4.891">the signature redacted but all portions</text>
  <text start="360.509" dur="6.391">of the classified secret and secret okay</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="6.21">so sounds about right</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="5.699">I mean that I don&amp;#39;t know about the CIA</text>
  <text start="369.36" dur="6.839">but basically that&amp;#39;s everyone in in</text>
  <text start="372.599" dur="5.04">politics speech or lease in the high</text>
  <text start="376.199" dur="3.27">levels where you would be sending out</text>
  <text start="377.639" dur="3.931">emissaries to Congress and the</text>
  <text start="379.469" dur="5.13">administration and stuff as pretty much</text>
  <text start="381.57" dur="5.399">everyone&amp;#39;s reaction it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not all</text>
  <text start="384.599" dur="5.971">that classified that&amp;#39;s just lawyer talk</text>
  <text start="386.969" dur="5.1">but yeah it&amp;#39;s a very interesting it&amp;#39;s</text>
