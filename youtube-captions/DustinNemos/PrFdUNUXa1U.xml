  <text start="6.609" dur="4.661">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="9.139" dur="4.111">emos and I am going to show you how to</text>
  <text start="11.27" dur="5.28">make your very own lugol&amp;#39;s iodine</text>
  <text start="13.25" dur="5.91">solution today just a disclaimer this is</text>
  <text start="16.55" dur="4.98">not medical advice now the first thing</text>
  <text start="19.16" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;re going to want to get is a bottle</text>
  <text start="21.53" dur="3.87">of distilled water I&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="23.33" dur="3.99">pre-measured it I&amp;#39;m gonna reuse my old</text>
  <text start="25.4" dur="4.47">apple cider vinegar jar so this is one</text>
  <text start="27.32" dur="4.41">quart which is perfect you can get a</text>
  <text start="29.87" dur="4.5">gallon of distilled water at pretty much</text>
  <text start="31.73" dur="5.46">any grocery store you&amp;#39;re going to need</text>
  <text start="34.37" dur="5.73">potassium iodide which is a form of salt</text>
  <text start="37.19" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s really you don&amp;#39;t want to be you</text>
  <text start="40.1" dur="2.61">don&amp;#39;t wanna get this in your eyes or</text>
  <text start="41.06" dur="3.39">anything like that it&amp;#39;s pretty potent</text>
  <text start="42.71" dur="5.58">stuff you don&amp;#39;t want to take it directly</text>
  <text start="44.45" dur="5.16">but this is useful for like radiation</text>
  <text start="48.29" dur="4.17">things like that I actually had</text>
  <text start="49.61" dur="6.539">originally got this years ago just in</text>
  <text start="52.46" dur="5.64">case we had any kind of radiation issues</text>
  <text start="56.149" dur="5.641">I basically around the time Fukushima</text>
  <text start="58.1" dur="6.349">came out as big news I I prepared with</text>
  <text start="61.79" dur="7.16">this very useful to protect your thyroid</text>
  <text start="64.449" dur="7.361">now beyond that you&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="68.95" dur="4.869">iodine prills pure iodine pearls these</text>
  <text start="71.81" dur="4.199">are like little little black balls I</text>
  <text start="73.819" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t know if you can see in there yeah</text>
  <text start="76.009" dur="4.081">you can see that they&amp;#39;re like little</text>
  <text start="77.749" dur="4.14">grains of pepper almost and you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="80.09" dur="6.779">want about 50 grams of that for one</text>
  <text start="81.889" dur="7.921">quart of solution and most people will</text>
  <text start="86.869" dur="5.191">buy the little iodine I get Infowars</text>
  <text start="89.81" dur="4.769">brand which is a pretty good quality</text>
  <text start="92.06" dur="3.869">this is one ounce and it&amp;#39;s you know you</text>
  <text start="94.579" dur="3.99">can buy one or two ounces at a time</text>
  <text start="95.929" dur="4.201">usually in their 30 40 dollars depending</text>
  <text start="98.569" dur="3.271">on where you go</text>
  <text start="100.13" dur="3.779">really powerful stuff really good for</text>
  <text start="101.84" dur="4.019">you but kind of expensive now and they</text>
  <text start="103.909" dur="5.01">do last a long time you only take a drop</text>
  <text start="105.859" dur="4.591">one to three drops a day and I think the</text>
  <text start="108.919" dur="2.43">solution that we&amp;#39;re making is actually</text>
  <text start="110.45" dur="5.189">going to be a little stronger than</text>
  <text start="111.349" dur="7.55">theirs now you can also buy little</text>
  <text start="115.639" dur="5.91">bottles like this have your own solution</text>
  <text start="118.899" dur="4.9">you just want to be able to do a dropper</text>
  <text start="121.549" dur="3.66">basically so you don&amp;#39;t even need a</text>
  <text start="123.799" dur="2.64">bottle you can just get a dropper and</text>
  <text start="125.209" dur="3.181">take it right out of your main bottle</text>
  <text start="126.439" dur="3.49">whatever you want to do now I have</text>
  <text start="128.39" dur="5.079">pre-measured</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="6.42">three and a half ounces of potassium</text>
  <text start="133.469" dur="5.64">iodide it&amp;#39;s a little chunky right now</text>
  <text start="136.349" dur="4.291">which is uh just because it&amp;#39;s sat for a</text>
  <text start="139.109" dur="3.891">long time in my cabinet and it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="4.739">old so it&amp;#39;s kind of clumped together</text>
  <text start="143" dur="6.73">you&amp;#39;re going to put the whole 50 grams</text>
  <text start="145.379" dur="6.661">in the bottle and let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="149.73" dur="4.259">next step it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning that it</text>
  <text start="152.04" dur="4.46">is corrosive to metal you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="153.989" dur="7.851">use metal spoons or anything like that</text>
  <text start="156.5" dur="7.51">I&amp;#39;m going to do this jar for mixing</text>
  <text start="161.84" dur="3.729">obviously that&amp;#39;s way too much space and</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="3.509">this jar actually comes with a metal lid</text>
  <text start="165.569" dur="4.131">so I&amp;#39;m not gonna use this to store it</text>
  <text start="167.519" dur="4.44">but since I don&amp;#39;t have my phone today</text>
  <text start="169.7" dur="5.53">I&amp;#39;m gonna have to order a new funnel and</text>
  <text start="171.959" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;m gonna transfer it to this so stay</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="4.649">tuned and you could use I was gonna use</text>
  <text start="177.659" dur="4.11">a like a wooden chopstick or something</text>
  <text start="179.879" dur="3.06">to stir but I&amp;#39;m not gonna make you watch</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="5.181">all the stirring and stuff it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="182.939" dur="7.86">simple to do this so you will take</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="5.8">obviously your your powder forgive me</text>
  <text start="190.799" dur="5.071">for not having like a nice desk and I</text>
  <text start="192.75" dur="6.54">can show you guys this I&amp;#39;m working on</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="4.769">getting a better desk now actually with</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="4.02">more space you know I&amp;#39;m a little</text>
  <text start="200.639" dur="5.731">cluttered right here then you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="5.429">to take your distilled water and mix a</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="4.88">little bit in there I don&amp;#39;t make too</text>
  <text start="208.739" dur="2.511">much of a mess</text>
  <text start="212.81" dur="9.34">and I&amp;#39;ll mix the rest in a minute then</text>
  <text start="216.57" dur="8.01">you&amp;#39;re going to take your prills which</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="4.11">gives you a kind of a cool reaction and</text>
  <text start="224.58" dur="3.51">there are warnings like to wear gloves</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="2.94">while touching the stuff things like</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="5.94">that because some of these are really</text>
  <text start="229.2" dur="6.57">really potent you&amp;#39;re gonna see a cool</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="9.71">color change going on in there</text>
  <text start="235.77" dur="7.97">pretty quickly look at that that&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="8.16">okay now the rest of the water I rinse</text>
  <text start="255.21" dur="3.99">this apple cider vinegar out really well</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="3.18">before I use it but I love for some</text>
  <text start="259.2" dur="2.67">reason I&amp;#39;ve always loved the last</text>
  <text start="260.19" dur="3.89">bottles I always try to save them use</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="7.59">them for something supplements vitamins</text>
  <text start="264.08" dur="8.38">homemade iodine solutions whatever now</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="4.47">this after you kind of stir it up I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="272.46" dur="2.52">gonna use like I said something made out</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="5.73">of wood you can use a wooden spoon</text>
  <text start="274.98" dur="6.18">wooden chopstick whatever you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="3.29">to set it somewhere in the dark for</text>
  <text start="281.16" dur="4.56">about 24 hours</text>
  <text start="282.95" dur="5.08">and then you&amp;#39;ll be good to go it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="6.38">be about five and a half to six percent</text>
  <text start="288.03" dur="7.02">iodine solutions called lugol&amp;#39;s lugol&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.1" dur="5.17">is based on the French physician lugal</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="4.59">which was in 1829 he actually invented</text>
  <text start="297.27" dur="5.58">the stuff they used it for like</text>
  <text start="299.64" dur="5.58">disinfecting purifying water things like</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="4.94">that some of the health benefits of</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="5.49">iodine all right now the list right here</text>
  <text start="307.79" dur="5.68">controls metabolic rate stimulates</text>
  <text start="310.71" dur="4.53">hormones maintains energy boosts immune</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="4.37">system promotes healthy skin helps</text>
  <text start="315.24" dur="5.25">remove toxins treats thyroid glands</text>
  <text start="317.84" dur="5.11">reproductive system under active thyroid</text>
  <text start="320.49" dur="4.02">gland which is a hypothyroidism and</text>
  <text start="322.95" dur="5.4">protects against radiation like I</text>
  <text start="324.51" dur="4.8">mentioned now there is a way to I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="328.35" dur="2.76">going to go through the whole process</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="4.23">but there is a way to test your iodine</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="4.77">levels at home you take a drop of this</text>
  <text start="333.54" dur="3.87">stuff put it on your skin if you&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="335.88" dur="3.39">messed with iodine before you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="337.41" dur="3.84">gonna stain pretty much anything it</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="5.7">touches and you&amp;#39;re gonna have a stain on</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="5.82">your skin for a while and if that after</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="4.2">so many hours have gone by if the stain</text>
  <text start="347.07" dur="4.08">is still there your body did not absorb</text>
  <text start="349.17" dur="3.75">it you don&amp;#39;t need any more but if it is</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="4.41">not there your body absorbed it and</text>
  <text start="352.92" dur="4.5">pulled it in through the skin you can</text>
  <text start="355.56" dur="4.38">find other videos about how to do this</text>
  <text start="357.42" dur="7.23">at home things like that again not</text>
  <text start="359.94" dur="6.51">medical advice but in a world like with</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="3.81">Fukushima and other things going on all</text>
  <text start="366.45" dur="3.9">the time and Fukushima is still dumping</text>
  <text start="368.46" dur="4.79">radiation into the ocean which gets into</text>
  <text start="370.35" dur="5.09">the seafood and</text>
  <text start="373.25" dur="3.9">and the rain and it dumps everywhere</text>
  <text start="375.44" dur="5.52">else the radiations an issue and it</text>
  <text start="377.15" dur="5.49">lasts basically forever the half-life is</text>
  <text start="380.96" dur="3.72">like 20,000 years so you&amp;#39;re definitely</text>
  <text start="382.64" dur="4.86">gonna see more and more radiation issues</text>
  <text start="384.68" dur="5.28">as time goes on the fish are already</text>
  <text start="387.5" dur="6.24">pretty contaminated with it I&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="389.96" dur="7.17">cut back to only eating small low on the</text>
  <text start="393.74" dur="4.71">food chain like shrimp things of that</text>
  <text start="397.13" dur="3">nature because I don&amp;#39;t want the</text>
  <text start="398.45" dur="3.9">radiation so I don&amp;#39;t eat any predator</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="3.6">fish because you know the little ones on</text>
  <text start="402.35" dur="3.21">the bottom the bottom feeders like</text>
  <text start="403.73" dur="3.51">shrimp they get a little bit but then</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="3.48">the fish that eats them gets more and</text>
  <text start="407.24" dur="3.66">concentrates it up the food chain you</text>
  <text start="409.04" dur="2.91">start eating things like bass and tuna</text>
  <text start="410.9" dur="3.21">you&amp;#39;re gonna get much higher</text>
  <text start="411.95" dur="7.83">concentrations of not only radiation but</text>
  <text start="414.11" dur="8.4">mercury as well so that is basically all</text>
  <text start="419.78" dur="5.31">I wanted to go through it&amp;#39;s also good to</text>
  <text start="422.51" dur="5.52">take it with healthy fats that will help</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="4.35">the absorption rate and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s about that simple guys</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a wonderful way to save a lot</text>
  <text start="431.99" dur="7.65">of money you can get this much for I</text>
  <text start="435.05" dur="7.8">think I&amp;#39;ve got about AB this was like 30</text>
  <text start="439.64" dur="6.81">bucks for the pearls and this is a large</text>
  <text start="442.85" dur="6.57">pack that I got I don&amp;#39;t know I think it</text>
  <text start="446.45" dur="6">was like 250 years ago it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="449.42" dur="4.2">expensive but compared to spending 30 40</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="2.19">dollars every time you get something</text>
  <text start="453.62" dur="3.09">like this</text>
  <text start="454.64" dur="4.83">it saves you a lot of money over time</text>
  <text start="456.71" dur="4.47">you know and a lot of people enjoyed my</text>
  <text start="459.47" dur="3.39">carbon 60 video how to make your own</text>
  <text start="461.18" dur="5.13">carbon 60 at home and that is another</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="5.94">big money saver so it&amp;#39;s always nice to</text>
  <text start="466.31" dur="4.62">make your own things at home especially</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="5.3">if it&amp;#39;s very simple and especially when</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="5.73">you get a better quality generally five</text>
  <text start="474.1" dur="4.81">five and a half six percent if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.66" dur="4.17">doing one quart like I&amp;#39;m doing here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.91" dur="4.319">gonna be two three times stronger than</text>
  <text start="480.83" dur="4.32">what you&amp;#39;ll probably get from</text>
  <text start="483.229" dur="4.141">like a retail usually they come in like</text>
  <text start="485.15" dur="4.169">two percent or something so you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="487.37" dur="3.479">need to take as much you&amp;#39;ll want to look</text>
  <text start="489.319" dur="3.18">up how to take it and everything else</text>
  <text start="490.849" dur="4.171">I&amp;#39;m only gonna do a drop of this a day</text>
  <text start="492.499" dur="6.39">and I might even take days where I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="495.02" dur="7.35">take any but very powerful very useful</text>
  <text start="498.889" dur="6.511">and also remember that when they added a</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="6.12">very cheap form of iodine to table salt</text>
  <text start="505.4" dur="6.479">the entire nation&amp;#39;s IQ started going up</text>
  <text start="508.49" dur="6.779">so this is really cool especially if you</text>
  <text start="511.879" dur="7.35">are nursing or have children or have a</text>
  <text start="515.269" dur="6.39">baby in the womb in my opinion we added</text>
  <text start="519.229" dur="4.17">a little bit to my wife&amp;#39;s diet just</text>
  <text start="521.659" dur="4.831">because I wanted to get as much IQ as I</text>
  <text start="523.399" dur="4.651">could for my baby but obviously you</text>
  <text start="526.49" dur="3.089">actually cut back a little bit when</text>
  <text start="528.05" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re pregnant on how much you can take</text>
  <text start="529.579" dur="6.12">you don&amp;#39;t want to overdo it there is a</text>
