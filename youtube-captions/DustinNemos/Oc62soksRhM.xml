  <text start="194.83" dur="4.26">visual for you guys in terms of quality</text>
  <text start="197.41" dur="3.54">because I&amp;#39;m getting like a yellow mark</text>
  <text start="199.09" dur="4.61">which says that some people may be</text>
  <text start="200.95" dur="2.75">having problems</text>
  <text start="212.11" dur="7.78">all right I think those tanks Jenny or</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="6.45">Bob Butler who&amp;#39;s being who&amp;#39;s being used</text>
  <text start="219.89" dur="4.92">by Jimmy I think that those tanks on the</text>
  <text start="223.79" dur="2.76">rails that we&amp;#39;re just going through</text>
  <text start="224.81" dur="3.51">California were actually just all like</text>
  <text start="226.55" dur="3.51">going around the country I think it was</text>
  <text start="228.32" dur="2.73">more of a visual and kind of an optics</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="3.75">thing I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="231.05" dur="5.1">using those things where they kind of</text>
  <text start="233.81" dur="4.08">run them to I mean you got Canada and</text>
  <text start="236.15" dur="3.39">you got Mexico and apparently we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="237.89" dur="3.72">even keep people out of our border much</text>
  <text start="239.54" dur="2.85">less drive tanks down to Mexico like</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="3.87">what are you gonna do with all these</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="4.44">tanks I think it&amp;#39;s a more of a display</text>
  <text start="245.48" dur="3.93">of power and drive them through</text>
  <text start="246.83" dur="3.06">California and non-stop throw some giant</text>

  <text start="273.77" dur="4.58">want to chat about like I&amp;#39;m up for any</text>
  <text start="275.51" dur="6.78">topics you know health economics or news</text>
  <text start="278.35" dur="10.24">it&amp;#39;s kind of a hanging out not work but</text>
  <text start="282.29" dur="8.22">more like casual relaxation yeah flip</text>
  <text start="288.59" dur="3.6">the whip says no notification bro and</text>
  <text start="290.51" dur="4.62">yes that&amp;#39;s true most the time you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="292.19" dur="6.15">get notifications for my stuff there is</text>
  <text start="295.13" dur="4.98">a pool called censorship and all of us</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="3.12">truth tellers are in it some of us are</text>
  <text start="300.11" dur="3.78">in the shallow end some of us are in the</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="8.01">deep end I&amp;#39;ve been on the deep end since</text>
  <text start="303.89" dur="7.5">like day 11 so unfortunately I think the</text>
  <text start="309.47" dur="4.02">only deeper it gets is the kind of</text>
  <text start="311.39" dur="5.49">situation where you see outright bands</text>
  <text start="313.49" dur="5.31">of books and such and I think I would be</text>
  <text start="316.88" dur="3.84">there it just depends on on the</text>
  <text start="318.8" dur="3.99">situation they couldn&amp;#39;t do that with my</text>
  <text start="320.72" dur="4.29">book because it was too popular to fasts</text>
  <text start="322.79" dur="4.02">you know it would cast more light on it</text>
  <text start="325.01" dur="3.57">if they were to censor it but they did</text>
  <text start="326.81" dur="3.75">that with a friend of Mines book Carrie</text>
  <text start="328.58" dur="4.98">Rivera they just banned her book about</text>
  <text start="330.56" dur="4.5">autism the symptom known as autism I</text>
  <text start="333.56" dur="3.12">think that&amp;#39;s close to the name of the</text>
  <text start="335.06" dur="4.44">book they just banned that out right</text>
  <text start="336.68" dur="4.68">right so that&amp;#39;s even worse than than the</text>
  <text start="339.5" dur="4.779">nigh particular situation so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="341.36" dur="5.229">little bit deeper but not much</text>
  <text start="344.279" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s in censorship is very bad it is</text>
  <text start="346.589" dur="4.5">very bad for truthers and I am in the</text>
  <text start="349.139" dur="4.2">almost the worst category you can get</text>
  <text start="351.089" dur="4.83">plus I&amp;#39;m bad at getting around it with</text>
  <text start="353.339" dur="4.44">all of the damn keywords like a thousand</text>
  <text start="355.919" dur="6.39">different words that will flag you I&amp;#39;m I</text>
  <text start="357.779" dur="6.271">don&amp;#39;t do that that&amp;#39;s too much Christine</text>
  <text start="362.309" dur="5.121">I&amp;#39;m so happy that c60 helped your dog</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="3.38">tell us the story if you don&amp;#39;t mind</text>
  <text start="368.149" dur="3.91">maybe Ginny I don&amp;#39;t know about the the</text>
  <text start="370.409" dur="3.48">tanks and the arrests and stuff I mean</text>
  <text start="372.059" dur="3.06">those tanks just drive around every once</text>
  <text start="373.889" dur="4.5">in a while every couple of years you see</text>
  <text start="375.119" dur="6.181">a minor maybe maybe they&amp;#39;re empty I mean</text>
  <text start="378.389" dur="5.131">frankly we don&amp;#39;t need tanks for for any</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="4.589">of the stuff that we have internal tanks</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="5.039">are weapons of war the only reason that</text>
  <text start="385.889" dur="5.36">we would need a tank is if you know</text>
  <text start="388.559" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re being invaded by tanks basically</text>
  <text start="391.249" dur="4.54">you know maybe if there are large</text>
  <text start="393.809" dur="4.08">contingencies of foot soldiers that kind</text>
  <text start="395.789" dur="5.4">of thing having some heavy firepower</text>
  <text start="397.889" dur="4.86">with your contingent with a tank could</text>
  <text start="401.189" dur="3.72">give you an advantage obviously and like</text>
  <text start="402.749" dur="3.72">a small arms kind of combat like a tank</text>
  <text start="404.909" dur="4.35">every here and every here and there but</text>
  <text start="406.469" dur="4.861">you&amp;#39;re never gonna see that in the US by</text>
  <text start="409.259" dur="3.87">the time things got that bad all the</text>
  <text start="411.33" dur="3.329">rednecks would show up with guns and we</text>
  <text start="413.129" dur="3.66">would be we would be victorious</text>
  <text start="414.659" dur="5.19">so I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re actually gonna</text>
  <text start="416.789" dur="6.15">see tanks in the US I think that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="419.849" dur="6.35">of a waste of money frankly I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="422.939" dur="8.1">think they&amp;#39;re that useful in terms of</text>
  <text start="426.199" dur="6.131">future warfare at all I think a tank is</text>
  <text start="431.039" dur="2.55">kind of an old thing it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="432.33" dur="4.559">waste of money I know they have some new</text>
  <text start="433.589" dur="4.88">new tech on them but against</text>
  <text start="436.889" dur="3.24">government&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re virtually useless</text>
  <text start="438.469" dur="4.35">against people who are intelligent</text>
  <text start="440.129" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re virtually useless but against</text>
  <text start="442.819" dur="4.38">whatever on the ground maybe they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="445.019" dur="2.18">useful</text>
  <text start="453.51" dur="3.66">maybe so Jenny III don&amp;#39;t always get all</text>
  <text start="456.06" dur="7.14">my messages on Twitter</text>
  <text start="457.17" dur="8.43">unfortunately Wow Christine that is so</text>
  <text start="463.2" dur="4.11">cool I&amp;#39;ve you know I had a dog that used</text>
  <text start="465.6" dur="4.44">to have a problem with his anal glands</text>
  <text start="467.31" dur="5.52">but it was only when he was a puppy for</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="6.29">the most part and it hasn&amp;#39;t been about a</text>
  <text start="472.83" dur="7.26">problem or bother for for quite a while</text>
  <text start="476.33" dur="5.8">yeah Tim says our Sheriff offices have</text>
  <text start="480.09" dur="3.69">their own tanks now well you know even</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="3.57">Trump&amp;#39;s behind the idea of giving all of</text>
  <text start="483.78" dur="5.04">them surplus military stuff to the</text>
  <text start="485.7" dur="5.76">police I don&amp;#39;t like that at all but you</text>
  <text start="488.82" dur="4.11">know this whole law and order thing you</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="3.45">know that sounds great until you get</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="4.53">into a situation where it&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="494.91" dur="3.99">dirty or anything and you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.46" dur="4.23">trying to scale back government in so</text>
  <text start="498.9" dur="4.77">many other ways but he is arming police</text>
  <text start="501.69" dur="5.22">with these surplus weapons and sighs yes</text>
  <text start="503.67" dur="7.62">that sucks they don&amp;#39;t need those kind of</text>
  <text start="506.91" dur="6.45">weapons not even for an thief oh the</text>
  <text start="511.29" dur="3.809">modern the modern police officer has has</text>
  <text start="513.36" dur="4.739">morphed from officer you know friendly</text>
  <text start="515.099" dur="5.13">from you know what&amp;#39;s the old TV shows</text>
  <text start="518.099" dur="4.231">with some good cops in them I&amp;#39;m sure I</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="3.841">could think of a few but you guys know</text>
  <text start="522.33" dur="3.9">what I mean like the older time TV shows</text>
  <text start="524.07" dur="3.54">where police are actually like public</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="2.52">servants who tried to help people and</text>
  <text start="527.61" dur="3.84">they knew their neighbors and nowadays</text>
  <text start="528.75" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re they wear military weapons of</text>
  <text start="531.45" dur="8.09">war body armor and and liking sunglasses</text>
  <text start="534.9" dur="4.64">and they&amp;#39;re all jerks for the most part</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="4.8">caffeine addict I am not strong on</text>
  <text start="545.32" dur="4.98">sasquatch Mike beyonce and her</text>
  <text start="547.93" dur="4.5">Luciferian stuff yes</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="4.98">frankly though I think she&amp;#39;s more of</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="5.01">sort of a they thought you would follow</text>
  <text start="555.28" dur="4.5">the stars I think she is a full and kale</text>
  <text start="557.44" dur="4.47">for slave her disassociative personality</text>
  <text start="559.78" dur="4.65">with with Sasha Fierce kind of makes me</text>
  <text start="561.91" dur="4.29">think that her constant use of symbolism</text>
  <text start="564.43" dur="4.56">in her music and such but usually those</text>
  <text start="566.2" dur="4.53">people are idiots you&amp;#39;re not gonna spend</text>
  <text start="568.99" dur="3.57">all your time learning how to dance the</text>
  <text start="570.73" dur="3.87">right move and also be an expert on the</text>
  <text start="572.56" dur="4.95">occult beyonce is probably an idiot and</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="4.52">probably just a useful puppet we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="577.51" dur="4.08">this with other artists and in</text>
  <text start="579.12" dur="3.97">situations where Hollywood is like you</text>
  <text start="581.59" dur="3.06">have to play these lyrics you have to do</text>
  <text start="583.09" dur="3.9">this you have to push this kind of</text>
  <text start="584.65" dur="3.51">ideology or this sort of symbolism even</text>
  <text start="586.99" dur="5.04">though they may not know what it means</text>
  <text start="588.16" dur="5.55">then you start to see the like God don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="592.03" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t you know I&amp;#39;m not gonna do it all</text>
  <text start="593.71" dur="3.21">the way but you&amp;#39;ll see the hand over the</text>
  <text start="595.15" dur="3.24">eye and the stupid pictures and then</text>
  <text start="596.92" dur="6.14">it&amp;#39;s just like the one eye that you can</text>
  <text start="598.39" dur="7.68">see and all of that symbolism right so</text>
  <text start="603.06" dur="4.24">she&amp;#39;s all into that they use her it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.07" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s almost as though</text>
  <text start="607.3" dur="5.91">for example Michelle Obama you know</text>
  <text start="610.45" dur="7.74">Michael Obama whenever whenever Michelle</text>
  <text start="613.21" dur="6.87">/ Michael needs a starve to help do</text>
  <text start="618.19" dur="5.1">something like get the message out or</text>
  <text start="620.08" dur="6.75">something suddenly she&amp;#39;s she sliced he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="623.29" dur="6.72">friends with Beyonce right so it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="626.83" dur="5.22">the only time Michelle really wheels out</text>
  <text start="630.01" dur="3.39">Beyonce as if she&amp;#39;s got some some sort</text>
  <text start="632.05" dur="3.33">of a message to try to push on people</text>
  <text start="633.4" dur="5.73">claims that they&amp;#39;re friends but not</text>
  <text start="635.38" dur="6.81">really I think that&amp;#39;s it and and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="639.13" dur="4.41">also seen a lot of the serial brain to</text>
  <text start="642.19" dur="2.61">has brought this out a lot but some of</text>
  <text start="643.54" dur="3.18">the black and the blue some of the</text>
  <text start="644.8" dur="4.74">symbolism some of the back and the forth</text>
  <text start="646.72" dur="6.56">on Twitter comments between sort of a</text>
  <text start="649.54" dur="6.24">Michelle Obama and you know a Beyonce</text>
  <text start="653.28" dur="4.63">sometimes that&amp;#39;s hidden messages to</text>
  <text start="655.78" dur="4.11">their to their agents sometimes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="657.91" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s just hidden in plain sight in their</text>
  <text start="659.89" dur="4.86">public statements with with pre-arranged</text>
  <text start="661.96" dur="6.26">understanding and code and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="664.75" dur="3.47">how they maintain plausible deniability</text>
  <text start="668.56" dur="4.56">yeah Trump referred to Michelle is he</text>
  <text start="671.62" dur="5.18">you know obama has referred them to</text>
  <text start="673.12" dur="3.68">michelle isn&amp;#39;t Michael think twice</text>
  <text start="678.25" dur="4.26">what was it Joan Rivers died suddenly</text>
  <text start="680.68" dur="3.18">and mysteriously after calling out</text>
  <text start="682.51" dur="3.36">Michelle Obama even though they were</text>
  <text start="683.86" dur="5.04">supposedly like friends of Obama&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="685.87" dur="4.89">such although I&amp;#39;m not even sure that she</text>
  <text start="688.9" dur="3.3">died I think some people are saying that</text>
  <text start="690.76" dur="5.1">she&amp;#39;s around now with just a ton of</text>

  <text start="736.75" dur="5.76">voices for truth there it&amp;#39;s bad I hope</text>
  <text start="740.83" dur="6.06">that with the nemo&amp;#39;s and his network I</text>

  <text start="750.37" dur="4.38">necessarily have free speech anymore</text>
  <text start="752.47" dur="5.88">from here in the US where we do and will</text>
  <text start="754.75" dur="5.04">continue to have free speech I think we</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="1.89">could reinforce some truthers out in the</text>
  <text start="759.79" dur="4.65">world</text>
  <text start="760.24" dur="6.96">I don&amp;#39;t know and also if you think about</text>
  <text start="764.44" dur="4.56">it some of the evidence were or least</text>
  <text start="767.2" dur="4.89">some of the speculation I would say from</text>
  <text start="769" dur="4.77">CEO brains that maybe Michelle Obama is</text>
  <text start="772.09" dur="3.96">really the the one where in the pants</text>
  <text start="773.77" dur="4.62">there and also the higher ranking of the</text>
  <text start="776.05" dur="4.86">Cabal types compared to her husband</text>
  <text start="778.39" dur="4.38">Obama who was basically just kind of</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="3.57">doing low-level stuff most the time</text>
  <text start="782.77" dur="7.7">she&amp;#39;s the one that apparently has gutted</text>
  <text start="784.48" dur="8.16">our military made it weakened yeah so I</text>
  <text start="790.47" dur="3.13">don&amp;#39;t know if I missed anything but if</text>
  <text start="792.64" dur="3.57">you have a question</text>
  <text start="793.6" dur="6.02">I missed please repeat it I kind of go</text>
  <text start="796.21" dur="3.41">on a rant sometimes I&amp;#39;m sorry about that</text>
  <text start="802.06" dur="6.58">Jenny Hillary is going over to all over</text>
  <text start="806.09" dur="3.99">talking at events for the same reason</text>
  <text start="808.64" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re all being super active the same</text>
  <text start="810.08" dur="3.6">reason by Biden&amp;#39;s running for president</text>
  <text start="812.03" dur="3.03">knows he can&amp;#39;t win they&amp;#39;re all running</text>
  <text start="813.68" dur="3.33">for president no they can&amp;#39;t win they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="815.06" dur="4.8">all doing this and that because and my</text>
  <text start="817.01" dur="5.01">my thought on this at least is that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="819.86" dur="3.93">much more difficult with the optics and</text>
  <text start="822.02" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s what this is an optics war to</text>
  <text start="823.79" dur="3.78">arrest a Hillary Clinton when she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="825.8" dur="3.54">running for president than it is to</text>
  <text start="827.57" dur="4.19">arrest her when she&amp;#39;s just a private</text>
  <text start="829.34" dur="4.77">citizen who&amp;#39;s not involved actively</text>
  <text start="831.76" dur="6.4">against the person who&amp;#39;s about to arrest</text>
  <text start="834.11" dur="5.88">her so what do you do if you know you</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="3.3">know that you&amp;#39;ve committed a crime and</text>
  <text start="839.99" dur="2.46">you&amp;#39;re going to go down you know the</text>
  <text start="841.46" dur="4.47">people that are gonna come after you</text>
  <text start="842.45" dur="7.05">everything else you muddy the waters you</text>
  <text start="845.93" dur="6.03">project the crime on to them and and</text>
  <text start="849.5" dur="4.08">then you try to get ahead of it you try</text>
  <text start="851.96" dur="4.47">your best to get ahead of it before it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="853.58" dur="4.35">gonna actually happen and and she&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="856.43" dur="3.93">a lot of that but it&amp;#39;s just not gonna</text>
  <text start="857.93" dur="3.78">because Trump won it&amp;#39;s not gonna work</text>
  <text start="860.36" dur="4.86">and Hillary actually is gonna end up in</text>
  <text start="861.71" dur="5.28">prison but um she is obviously the only</text>
  <text start="865.22" dur="3.09">thing that they can do stay as public as</text>
  <text start="866.99" dur="3.42">possible stay as active as possible</text>
  <text start="868.31" dur="6.48">fight as hard as possible to stay out of</text>
  <text start="870.41" dur="5.37">prison and and you know alive because</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="2.52">many of them are gonna be put to death</text>
  <text start="875.78" dur="5.04">for treason what they&amp;#39;ve done is far</text>
  <text start="877.31" dur="5.85">worse than the Rosenbergs you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="880.82" dur="3.84">almost as though and if she wasn&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="3.54">evil I&amp;#39;d feel bad for her but they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="884.66" dur="4.26">got a role grandma out and work her to</text>
  <text start="886.7" dur="3.78">death literally I think because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="888.92" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re just that woman might not make</text>
  <text start="890.48" dur="5.61">it to Gitmo with all of a health</text>
  <text start="892.13" dur="5.67">problems she&amp;#39;s clearly got they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="896.09" dur="3.3">push her they&amp;#39;re gonna push her all the</text>
  <text start="897.8" dur="3.18">way to the end because they have no</text>
  <text start="899.39" dur="4.49">choice but to do exactly what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="900.98" dur="5.34">doing and the end result is predictable</text>
  <text start="903.88" dur="3.76">the only wild card is can they kill</text>
  <text start="906.32" dur="4.44">Trump or can they unleash something</text>
  <text start="907.64" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s too big for us like a bio weapon</text>
  <text start="910.76" dur="4.32">maybe candy Doris that was convenient</text>
  <text start="913.4" dur="3.72">timing something that would be big and</text>
  <text start="915.08" dur="3.72">scary and potentially like a consequence</text>
  <text start="917.12" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t arrest me don&amp;#39;t mess with us</text>
  <text start="918.8" dur="4.89">or we will do this that is the only two</text>
  <text start="921.95" dur="3.36">wild cards that concern me at this point</text>
  <text start="923.69" dur="2.94">frankly I know where the economy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="925.31" dur="4.59">heading and I know where the Justice</text>
  <text start="926.63" dur="4.77">phase is heading we are winning on the</text>
  <text start="929.9" dur="3.12">Justice phase all of the trends are good</text>
  <text start="931.4" dur="2.53">we&amp;#39;re kicking butt and we&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="933.02" dur="3.55">incremental</text>
  <text start="933.93" dur="4.17">toward justice of the big guys on the on</text>
  <text start="936.57" dur="3.959">the economy phase like we&amp;#39;re not winning</text>
  <text start="938.1" dur="5.549">not nearly as much as people think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="940.529" dur="5.341">winning but Trump has set this whole</text>
  <text start="943.649" dur="6.031">thing up to to do as well as we could</text>
  <text start="945.87" dur="5.4">and what was coming was inevitable as a</text>
  <text start="949.68" dur="3">mathematic certainty we were bankrupt</text>
  <text start="951.27" dur="3.78">all this other stuff way before Trump</text>
  <text start="952.68" dur="4.2">this was a certainty it had to crash it</text>
  <text start="955.05" dur="4.979">had to collapse all of that is still</text>
  <text start="956.88" dur="4.89">coming but I think that&amp;#39;s a positive</text>
  <text start="960.029" dur="3.271">frankly because even though it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="961.77" dur="2.939">hurt short-term it&amp;#39;s gonna teach us</text>
  <text start="963.3" dur="3.87">really important lessons we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="964.709" dur="4.741">through like the Great Depression times</text>
  <text start="967.17" dur="3.45">ten but the lessons learned from that</text>
  <text start="969.45" dur="5">are going to carry with us for a</text>
  <text start="970.62" dur="3.83">generation and save this country I hope</text>
  <text start="974.57" dur="3.82">but yeah coma five makes a good point I</text>
  <text start="977.22" dur="3.72">hope they get arrested before they do</text>
  <text start="978.39" dur="4.38">their major FF well that that&amp;#39;s why a</text>
  <text start="980.94" dur="3.149">lot of times you&amp;#39;ll see Q come out and</text>
  <text start="982.77" dur="2.79">say we&amp;#39;re about to do this we&amp;#39;re about</text>
  <text start="984.089" dur="2.701">to do that and then it&amp;#39;s a false like it</text>
  <text start="985.56" dur="3.33">didn&amp;#39;t happen like it&amp;#39;s a big nothing</text>
  <text start="986.79" dur="5.37">burger sometimes he has to make them</text>
  <text start="988.89" dur="8.67">kind of blow their ammo you know like</text>
  <text start="992.16" dur="7.02">the old what is the the old like the war</text>
  <text start="997.56" dur="3.06">movies like World War two you see them</text>
  <text start="999.18" dur="3.659">in the trenches or something and I put</text>
  <text start="1000.62" dur="3.78">their hat or their helmet on a stick and</text>
  <text start="1002.839" dur="4.261">raise it up and they get shot like crazy</text>
  <text start="1004.4" dur="5.79">as soon as it&amp;#39;s like visible that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1007.1" dur="4.53">Q is doing every time he does that they</text>
  <text start="1010.19" dur="2.88">only have so many of these bullets it</text>
  <text start="1011.63" dur="4.41">takes time to set that kind of thing up</text>
  <text start="1013.07" dur="4.53">clearly right so you know Podesta was</text>
  <text start="1016.04" dur="3.419">over there when the New Zealand thing</text>
  <text start="1017.6" dur="4.26">happened now we have Michelle Obama over</text>
  <text start="1019.459" dur="4.651">there and the Notre Dame happened which</text>
  <text start="1021.86" dur="6.29">I&amp;#39;m not entirely convinced was a black</text>
  <text start="1024.11" dur="6.63">cap operation anyway but um we also have</text>
  <text start="1028.15" dur="4.99">very strong correlation that the death</text>
  <text start="1030.74" dur="3.66">counts are ordered you know on Twitter</text>
  <text start="1033.14" dur="2.97">like this is how many have to die</text>
  <text start="1034.4" dur="3.87">because look at how she had that</text>
  <text start="1036.11" dur="5.79">fifty-two second video linked to the 52</text>
  <text start="1038.27" dur="6.09">deaths is it was weird right I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1041.9" dur="6.23">believe in all those coincidences so</text>
  <text start="1044.36" dur="6.3">yeah a rabies virus released a</text>
  <text start="1048.13" dur="5.88">genetically predetermined virus that</text>
  <text start="1050.66" dur="6">targets specific races or types a a</text>
  <text start="1054.01" dur="4.24">generalized sort of a plague that could</text>
  <text start="1056.66" dur="3.09">wipe out a lot of people because it</text>
  <text start="1058.25" dur="3.66">would incubate for a month or two before</text>
  <text start="1059.75" dur="4.59">killing like Candida horas which is a</text>
  <text start="1061.91" dur="5.73">fungus frankly folks that scares me</text>
  <text start="1064.34" dur="4.59">because Candida is is your user</text>
  <text start="1067.64" dur="4.17">usual yeast problem right in your</text>
  <text start="1068.93" dur="4.74">stomach and that is also a fungus and</text>
  <text start="1071.81" dur="4.71">and we&amp;#39;re all overgrown with that really</text>
  <text start="1073.67" dur="4.32">bad in the US because we love sugar so</text>
  <text start="1076.52" dur="2.91">everybody has an overgrowth of Candida</text>
  <text start="1077.99" dur="2.67">and we just kind of live with it even</text>
  <text start="1079.43" dur="3.66">though it causes us major health</text>
  <text start="1080.66" dur="5.04">problems over time what happens when</text>
  <text start="1083.09" dur="5.16">this new form of yeast sort of replaces</text>
  <text start="1085.7" dur="4.65">the old or or we all just have this new</text>
  <text start="1088.25" dur="3.81">form of the yeast which has like a about</text>
  <text start="1090.35" dur="3.12">50% death rate or something if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1092.06" dur="5.52">already sick it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1093.47" dur="5.7">weakened it will kill you so just</text>
  <text start="1097.58" dur="3.69">imagine where we&amp;#39;re gonna be in 1020</text>
  <text start="1099.17" dur="6.27">years when this particular yeast is as</text>
  <text start="1101.27" dur="6.27">widespread as the old one it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="1105.44" dur="4.32">away I think and I don&amp;#39;t think that you</text>
  <text start="1107.54" dur="3.63">can you just get rid of yeast like that</text>
  <text start="1109.76" dur="5.16">these kind of funguses are very</text>
  <text start="1111.17" dur="5.94">persistent and that is the kind of thing</text>
  <text start="1114.92" dur="3.6">where I don&amp;#39;t think Trump could stop it</text>
  <text start="1117.11" dur="3.27">I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any way to stop</text>
  <text start="1118.52" dur="3.6">that kind of a yeast from spreading</text>
  <text start="1120.38" dur="3.33">especially if they&amp;#39;re being dumped</text>
  <text start="1122.12" dur="5.9">actively in multiple locations like I</text>
  <text start="1123.71" dur="6.42">think is going on to start the process</text>
  <text start="1128.02" dur="3.37">so there&amp;#39;s a lot of things I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1130.13" dur="3.69">frankly worried about it I know how to</text>
  <text start="1131.39" dur="4.23">kill Candida but you know at the same</text>
  <text start="1133.82" dur="3.96">point this is gonna kill a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1135.62" dur="3.57">this soon become the new norm and the</text>
  <text start="1137.78" dur="3.93">information is there to save us from it</text>
  <text start="1139.19" dur="5.91">I think I mean this isn&amp;#39;t tested against</text>
  <text start="1141.71" dur="5.22">Candida or risk particularly but um you</text>
  <text start="1145.1" dur="3.33">know for example and I don&amp;#39;t sell this I</text>
  <text start="1146.93" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t even want to sell this I looked</text>
  <text start="1148.43" dur="5.04">into it because it helps people but</text>
  <text start="1151.07" dur="5.85">people go to jail for selling this but</text>
  <text start="1153.47" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s very cheap this kills Candida I did</text>
  <text start="1156.92" dur="5.22">an interview about this particular</text>
  <text start="1159.14" dur="5.07">supplement with Kerry Rivera recently</text>
  <text start="1162.14" dur="4.11">when they censored her book and we kind</text>
  <text start="1164.21" dur="4.35">of talked about some of the amazing</text>
  <text start="1166.25" dur="4.2">effects of MMS which is dirt cheap</text>
  <text start="1168.56" dur="10.08">that&amp;#39;s like a year supply I think this</text>
  <text start="1170.45" dur="9.78">is about 25 dollars it&amp;#39;s amazing so but</text>
  <text start="1178.64" dur="3">that information could save a lot of</text>
  <text start="1180.23" dur="4.38">people&amp;#39;s lives but it&amp;#39;s hard to get that</text>
  <text start="1181.64" dur="5.13">out there because in the sensor which</text>
  <text start="1184.61" dur="3.929">I&amp;#39;m working on</text>
  <text start="1186.77" dur="5.779">I wish I could tell you guys more about</text>
  <text start="1188.539" dur="7.051">that well Jeff I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1192.549" dur="4.811">yes quality probiotics are good in the</text>
  <text start="1195.59" dur="4.199">gut good for the gut and they would help</text>
  <text start="1197.36" dur="4.169">against the candida but that eat that</text>
  <text start="1199.789" dur="3.721">slime wall that Candida builds up to</text>

  <text start="1203.51" dur="8.22">probiotics can&amp;#39;t touch that either so</text>
  <text start="1207.549" dur="6.13">what you would probably have to do is is</text>
  <text start="1211.73" dur="3.78">destroy it first the slime wall that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1213.679" dur="3.181">the like the slime wall of the yeast</text>

  <text start="1307.77" dur="6.12">just oxidizer that just scrubs your body</text>
  <text start="1310.11" dur="5.64">clean on the inside now I will drink it</text>

  <text start="1339.93" dur="4.56">necessary anymore because like the Somel</text>
  <text start="1341.97" dur="4.11">vitamins have have come a long way and</text>
  <text start="1344.49" dur="3.15">they I&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a second</text>
  <text start="1346.08" dur="4.92">first</text>
  <text start="1347.64" dur="5.88">usually you would sip on eight drops of</text>
  <text start="1351" dur="4.2">each in a glass of water for about eight</text>
  <text start="1353.52" dur="3.18">ounces and you would do about an ounce</text>
  <text start="1355.2" dur="3.06">an hour for about eight hours I think</text>
  <text start="1356.7" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s one of the like beginning</text>

  <text start="1361.89" dur="5.72">gonna drink them all at once</text>
  <text start="1363.15" dur="4.46">because you guys could know it&amp;#39;s safe oh</text>
  <text start="1369.14" dur="4.1">man</text>
  <text start="1371.05" dur="5.49">doesn&amp;#39;t taste good like that though and</text>
  <text start="1373.24" dur="6.63">I&amp;#39;ll tell you that ah it&amp;#39;s not illegal</text>
  <text start="1376.54" dur="4.07">it&amp;#39;s just really hard to sell it and get</text>
  <text start="1379.87" dur="2.88">away with it</text>
  <text start="1380.61" dur="3.48">actually I know a company that sells it</text>
  <text start="1382.75" dur="4.05">and they want to give me the business</text>
  <text start="1384.09" dur="4.81">but I they told me look if you take this</text>
  <text start="1386.8" dur="3.69">you might go to jail that you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1388.9" dur="2.94">seen them kick in people&amp;#39;s doors before</text>
  <text start="1390.49" dur="2.73">I&amp;#39;ve seen people go to prison for this</text>
  <text start="1391.84" dur="8.13">they&amp;#39;re trying to get out of the</text>
  <text start="1393.22" dur="8.1">business hey Roberto fact I probably</text>
  <text start="1399.97" dur="2.37">should get some water behind that</text>
  <text start="1401.32" dur="3.92">because it makes your stomach feel</text>
  <text start="1402.34" dur="2.9">really weird I&amp;#39;ll be right back</text>
  <text start="1412.14" dur="5.74">so of course just like hydrogen peroxide</text>
  <text start="1415.72" dur="6.26">if you drink them a couple of spoons of</text>
  <text start="1417.88" dur="4.1">that it&amp;#39;s gonna feel a little bit weird</text>
  <text start="1424.17" dur="4.39">so yes with hydrogen peroxide you would</text>
  <text start="1426.46" dur="7.32">only use food grade you would need to</text>
  <text start="1428.56" dur="6.95">die to dilute that amazingly because of</text>
  <text start="1433.78" dur="7.47">course what what is that gonna do to you</text>
  <text start="1435.51" dur="8.29">yeah before I go into life it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1441.25" dur="3.87">okay so the hydrogen peroxide food great</text>
  <text start="1443.8" dur="2.73">stuff is great it seemed great for</text>
  <text start="1445.12" dur="6.63">animals great for chickens everything</text>
  <text start="1446.53" dur="7.83">else but when you&amp;#39;re doing that it is so</text>
  <text start="1451.75" dur="5.61">strong I mean I think 90% is is rocket</text>
  <text start="1454.36" dur="5.64">fuel food grade is 35% the usual little</text>
  <text start="1457.36" dur="3.87">brown bottle is 3% you put that stuff on</text>
  <text start="1460" dur="3.39">you or you try to drink it&amp;#39;s gonna burn</text>
  <text start="1461.23" dur="5.4">you&amp;#39;s gonna hurt you always dilute it</text>
  <text start="1463.39" dur="9.71">and I mean like a drop per gallon does</text>
  <text start="1466.63" dur="8.75">not take much so we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1473.1" dur="5.56">real briefly there we got into</text>
  <text start="1475.38" dur="5.02">intravenous vitamin C the old days I</text>
  <text start="1478.66" dur="5.28">would have thought intravenous vitamin C</text>
  <text start="1480.4" dur="5.19">was one of the best options and and</text>
  <text start="1483.94" dur="3.21">thank you by the way for the for the</text>
  <text start="1485.59" dur="3.27">tips and donations guys I really</text>
  <text start="1487.15" dur="4.23">appreciate that Jeff and untitled and</text>
  <text start="1488.86" dur="4.26">everybody sorry I&amp;#39;m kind of getting too</text>
  <text start="1491.38" dur="3">carried away a little bit with my with</text>
  <text start="1493.12" dur="3.18">my rant here</text>
  <text start="1494.38" dur="7.2">I love these topics ok these are</text>
  <text start="1496.3" dur="7.2">important topics so the liposomal z&amp;#39; or</text>
  <text start="1501.58" dur="3.62">better i think because they&amp;#39;re more</text>
  <text start="1503.5" dur="3.75">accessible than even the intravenous</text>
  <text start="1505.2" dur="3.91">because when you do intravenous you get</text>
  <text start="1507.25" dur="3.84">a huge mega dose of vitamin C which you</text>
  <text start="1509.11" dur="5.64">cannot overdose on of course kills</text>
  <text start="1511.09" dur="5.18">almost everything even cancer I think of</text>
  <text start="1514.75" dur="5.85">course no claims or medical advice</text>
  <text start="1516.27" dur="6.34">however you know you need an IV you need</text>
  <text start="1520.6" dur="3.75">probably a medical team you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="1522.61" dur="4.26">gonna be in a doctor&amp;#39;s care at that</text>
  <text start="1524.35" dur="5.16">point they&amp;#39;re not gonna want to do it ok</text>
  <text start="1526.87" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re not gonna do it I&amp;#39;ve tried I eat</text>
  <text start="1529.51" dur="2.93">my sister was like laying on the table</text>
  <text start="1530.77" dur="4.98">of dying and they still wouldn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="1532.44" dur="7.87">on the other hand the liposomal stuff</text>
  <text start="1535.75" dur="5.96">I&amp;#39;ve talked about this a lot got one</text>
  <text start="1540.31" dur="6.73">around here somewhere for this</text>
  <text start="1541.71" dur="8.79">here&amp;#39;s my vitamin D version and this</text>
  <text start="1547.04" dur="5.86">works by wrapping the new nutrient in a</text>
  <text start="1550.5" dur="5.1">fat cell a lipid so therefore a</text>
  <text start="1552.9" dur="5.61">liposomal and that protective shell of</text>
  <text start="1555.6" dur="5.55">fat basically as you know fat is more</text>
  <text start="1558.51" dur="4.62">resistant to acid so it protects the</text>
  <text start="1561.15" dur="3.96">nutrient from your stomach and it just</text>
  <text start="1563.13" dur="3.51">goes right on through into your blood or</text>
  <text start="1565.11" dur="6.45">into your intestines and into your blood</text>
  <text start="1566.64" dur="7.2">so c60 is done similarly although it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1571.56" dur="5.01">not in nutrient but liposomal vitamins</text>
  <text start="1573.84" dur="6">are 20-30 times you know in some cases</text>
  <text start="1576.57" dur="5.82">more absorbable that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a big deal</text>
  <text start="1579.84" dur="4.2">you know so think intravenous vitamin C</text>
  <text start="1582.39" dur="3.87">will be the only way to get a negative</text>
  <text start="1584.04" dur="4.04">sir vitamin C is to inject it and into</text>
  <text start="1586.26" dur="4.92">your arm as a pouch of water or liquid</text>
  <text start="1588.08" dur="4.69">well not anymore now you can do this you</text>
  <text start="1591.18" dur="4.49">can do liposomal vitamin C and take a</text>
  <text start="1592.77" dur="6.6">few pills and get the same amount now</text>
  <text start="1595.67" dur="6.19">that is a incredible power that could</text>
  <text start="1599.37" dur="6.57">eliminate most disease that one thing I</text>
  <text start="1601.86" dur="6.57">think my opinion but that is to just</text>
  <text start="1605.94" dur="4.77">information and it&amp;#39;s almost free vitamin</text>
  <text start="1608.43" dur="7.77">C is cheap in an S chlorine dioxide is</text>
  <text start="1610.71" dur="7.67">cheap yeah so I think I missed a few</text>
  <text start="1616.2" dur="2.18">questions</text>
  <text start="1618.95" dur="4.09">Joe piece has got my C 60 and olive oil</text>
  <text start="1621.78" dur="3.9">looked on the website trying figure out</text>

  <text start="1625.68" dur="3.75">optimal effectiveness it has not been</text>
  <text start="1627.78" dur="4.14">determined there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no optimal</text>
  <text start="1629.43" dur="4.68">dose for people out there that I know of</text>
  <text start="1631.92" dur="4.53">is so new and experimental people are</text>
  <text start="1634.11" dur="4.05">doing everything from a drop a day under</text>
  <text start="1636.45" dur="2.94">the tongue and then they swallow it</text>
  <text start="1638.16" dur="3.93">after holding it for a minute sometimes</text>
  <text start="1639.39" dur="5.1">not everybody even does that and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1642.09" dur="4.68">seen a whole bottle a day which is way</text>
  <text start="1644.49" dur="4.59">too much and not necessary and expensive</text>
  <text start="1646.77" dur="4.35">but a couple spoons a day for people</text>
  <text start="1649.08" dur="3.42">that are very aggressive or have a lot</text>
  <text start="1651.12" dur="4.98">of health problems build up to that</text>
  <text start="1652.5" dur="4.86">makes sense obviously I can&amp;#39;t give any</text>
  <text start="1656.1" dur="2.88">kind of dosages or anything like that</text>
  <text start="1657.36" dur="4.23">especially for something like this is</text>

  <text start="2265.39" dur="6.33">then also worth looking into would be</text>
  <text start="2268.44" dur="6.88">and there&amp;#39;s documentaries about this one</text>
  <text start="2271.72" dur="5.34">the Burzynski treatment down in Texas</text>

  <text start="2339.93" dur="3.91">you know if I owe Caesar something I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2342.61" dur="3.6">be happy to give it to him because I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="2348.81" dur="5.5">my perspective on it at least but yeah I</text>
  <text start="2351.61" dur="5.21">mean government is itself just to get my</text>
