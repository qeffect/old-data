  <text start="0.68" dur="4.24">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.24" dur="3.84">Mouse or destiny moz.com</text>
  <text start="4.92" dur="4.08">and there&amp;#39;s quite a bit of things to</text>
  <text start="7.08" dur="3.42">cover and I&amp;#39;m just frankly out of time</text>
  <text start="9" dur="3.84">to get through them all and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="10.5" dur="5.009">do some of these as kind of standalone</text>
  <text start="12.84" dur="4.35">topics they are very important so there</text>
  <text start="15.509" dur="3.331">will be some big things mixed in here as</text>
  <text start="17.19" dur="2.87">well but we&amp;#39;re gonna just kind of fly</text>
  <text start="18.84" dur="5.67">through them to get everybody up to date</text>
  <text start="20.06" dur="5.92">so Peterson and orb on meeting that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="24.51" dur="3.42">kind of a big deal they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="25.98" dur="5.28">discussing sort of the political culture</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="5.52">PC ideology and you know this is</text>
  <text start="31.26" dur="4.02">basically right there up there with the</text>
  <text start="33.45" dur="4.26">free speech issue which is something</text>
  <text start="35.28" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ve been kind of championing myself for</text>
  <text start="37.71" dur="3.93">quite a while but especially now that</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re going after them for censorship so</text>
  <text start="41.64" dur="4.68">this is very interesting they both agree</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="4.02">for instance that illegal immigration is</text>
  <text start="46.32" dur="5.1">unnecessary and dangerous of course that</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="5.04">all logic makes sense that because even</text>
  <text start="51.42" dur="4.26">if you&amp;#39;re even if your goal is genuinely</text>
  <text start="53.52" dur="4.65">to try to help a needle immigrants as</text>
  <text start="55.68" dur="4.53">much as possible you&amp;#39;ll do more probably</text>
  <text start="58.17" dur="4.02">about 12 times more I think this that is</text>
  <text start="60.21" dur="3.72">by sending the money rather than</text>
  <text start="62.19" dur="4.23">bringing them somewhere that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="3.57">fit in which is yeah no one wants to be</text>
  <text start="66.42" dur="3.75">the outsider anywhere it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="4.65">comfortable for anyone so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="70.17" dur="3.78">interesting to see that these two sort</text>
  <text start="72.15" dur="4.2">of thought leaders are working together</text>
  <text start="73.95" dur="3.8">at least meeting together this is the</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="4.17">way things get done the world folks</text>
  <text start="77.75" dur="5.229">ideas run the world and men like these</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="4.2">guys are the ones that could control</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="5.191">some of these ideas they get to spread</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="7.05">those ideas to the world so - these two</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="5.61">are like a poor house meeting and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.77" dur="4.5">a good thing and great things could come</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="4.44">out of meetings like this in fact the</text>
  <text start="96.27" dur="4.529">more leaders that meet with people like</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="4.59">- and Peterson the better because he has</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="4.53">a way of convincing people of the</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="4.11">soundness of this reason without being</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="4.591">you know of course he&amp;#39;s a psychologist</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="5.129">everything without being - you know I</text>
  <text start="109.92" dur="4.68">think he can bypass the ego I think he</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="4.291">can bypassed a lot of BS that people</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="3.479">generally have you know I have a hard</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="4.65">time trying to get around people&amp;#39;s nikko</text>
  <text start="118.079" dur="5.281">myself I think Jordan Peters was a great</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="3.78">way of doing that and if anyone has an</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="4.83">ego it&amp;#39;s a world leader right</text>
  <text start="124.77" dur="5.67">so for me spend too much time on that we</text>
  <text start="128.19" dur="2.97">also have the yellow vest attacking</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="3.32">prong</text>
  <text start="131.16" dur="4.73">politically for his abuse of a</text>
  <text start="133.76" dur="4.05">French philosopher I don&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="135.89" dur="5.03">pronounce that I&amp;#39;m gonna try Island</text>
  <text start="137.81" dur="5.789">people crawl at protests now basically</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="3.429">someone was mean to this guy I think</text>
  <text start="143.599" dur="2.491">he&amp;#39;s Jewish</text>
  <text start="144.349" dur="4.021">someone was mean to him from within the</text>
  <text start="146.09" dur="3.599">yellow vest movement probably a plant</text>
  <text start="148.37" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s how they work guys and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="149.689" dur="3.3">actually born I actually warn people I</text>
  <text start="151.64" dur="3.239">know within the best movement look it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.989" dur="3.33">only a matter of time until they start</text>
  <text start="154.879" dur="3.091">trying to plant people in there to do</text>
  <text start="156.319" dur="3.961">things and blame it on you just be ready</text>
  <text start="157.97" dur="3.689">for it you might have to bounce some</text>
  <text start="160.28" dur="3.629">people out of your own team I mean we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="161.659" dur="5.3">seen that here in the US where we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="163.909" dur="5.58">actually had roots like the metropolis</text>
  <text start="166.959" dur="4.331">McGinnis and they actually had to get</text>
  <text start="169.489" dur="4.411">some of those fake Nazi that or a group</text>
  <text start="171.29" dur="4.319">and they did it they actually will lead</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="4.199">them out I&amp;#39;m not encouraging violence</text>
  <text start="175.609" dur="3.511">but what happens otherwise is that you</text>
  <text start="178.099" dur="3.121">end up with situations like</text>
  <text start="179.12" dur="4.08">Charlottesville Virginia where some some</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="4.109">complete assholes that are liars that</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="3.689">are former Obama voters come in pretend</text>
  <text start="185.329" dur="3.601">that they&amp;#39;re from quarters and also by</text>
  <text start="186.889" dur="6.21">the way also happened to be like KKK</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="7.04">cover whatever is right come on to</text>
  <text start="193.099" dur="5.67">convenient anyway so they apparently</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="6.01">they shouted we are France and Zionists</text>
  <text start="198.769" dur="5.31">and go back to Tel Aviv so I mean not</text>
  <text start="201.98" dur="4.17">the worst insults out there but hey look</text>
  <text start="204.079" dur="4.111">I understand anti Zionist sentiment</text>
  <text start="206.15" dur="4.44">because you know there are people out</text>
  <text start="208.19" dur="3.449">there don&amp;#39;t want the Zionist movement to</text>
  <text start="210.59" dur="2.91">have that much influence in their</text>
  <text start="211.639" dur="3.391">cultures whether or not you believe in</text>
  <text start="213.5" dur="4.019">Jainism or not is it relevant</text>
  <text start="215.03" dur="5.789">that&amp;#39;s an Israel issue this is the USA</text>
  <text start="217.519" dur="4.951">why does it even matter right but it</text>
  <text start="220.819" dur="3.181">matters because there&amp;#39;s a lot of undue</text>
  <text start="222.47" dur="3.87">influence you there&amp;#39;s like a pact so</text>
  <text start="224" dur="3.989">whether or not whichever sides are on I</text>
  <text start="226.34" dur="2.7">know that this is a hot topic issue</text>
  <text start="227.989" dur="3.81">whether you&amp;#39;re Jewish</text>
  <text start="229.04" dur="5.55">whether you&amp;#39;re not Jewish guys come on</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="4.08">this is being fair and it just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="3.299">make a lot of sense now on the other</text>
  <text start="235.879" dur="3.871">hand of course my calling it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="237.889" dur="3.541">although they&amp;#39;re all anti-semitic and</text>
  <text start="239.75" dur="3.12">they hate Jewish people and look they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="2.699">so bullying and I mean of course he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="242.87" dur="3.57">gonna see something in the opportunity</text>
  <text start="244.129" dur="5.64">he can because he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a flailing</text>
  <text start="246.44" dur="6.6">loser and the subject I mean he he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="249.769" dur="4.951">product of pedophilia because he was</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="3.689">obviously you know with his wife look at</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="6.75">the story there he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s got a messed</text>
  <text start="256.729" dur="7.171">up brain he has a clear sort of power</text>
  <text start="261.47" dur="3.749">bend or he is completely going to go out</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="2.68">there and just used violence anything</text>
  <text start="265.219" dur="3.551">else he&amp;#39;s a tyrant</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="4.649">that&amp;#39;s been shown and these kind of</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="5.79">tricks are tyrant tricks manipulation</text>
  <text start="271.229" dur="6.831">tricks of the emotions he is trying to</text>
  <text start="274.56" dur="5.039">paint the yellow vest movement as racist</text>
  <text start="278.06" dur="2.979">go figure right</text>
  <text start="279.599" dur="5.69">I think he&amp;#39;s paying attention to the</text>
  <text start="281.039" dur="8.011">anti fun and maybe CNN we also have</text>
  <text start="285.289" dur="5.141">Nadler passing out now look he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.05" dur="2.7">probably pushing himself pretty hard</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="3.509">lately maybe he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="5.81">maybe his supply is cut off whatever</text>
  <text start="293.939" dur="3.621">right but this happened</text>
  <text start="313.07" dur="7.56">so he actually um see ya make sure I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="317.84" dur="4.74">eating myself I don&amp;#39;t think you hear it</text>
  <text start="320.63" dur="2.97">very well but they actually um the guy</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="3.36">right here next to him I can remember</text>
  <text start="323.6" dur="4.08">his name actually asked him if he was</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="3.99">okay if he needed some water it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="327.68" dur="5.37">he was dehydrated madla actually was</text>
  <text start="329.93" dur="4.65">able to muster okay like he just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="4.23">know as all he was almost in like mid</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="5.49">faint or mid heatstroke or something you</text>
  <text start="337.28" dur="6.27">know obviously look I don&amp;#39;t enjoy seeing</text>
  <text start="340.07" dur="5.61">anyone like that in that in that</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="5.01">position but I will say quite clearly</text>
  <text start="345.68" dur="4.02">that evil has taken its toll on a lot of</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="2.46">experienced health here&amp;#39;s the other</text>
  <text start="349.7" dur="3.86">video let me check this one out to be</text>
  <text start="351.02" dur="2.54">honest it</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="6.18">well there you have it um these enemies</text>
  <text start="384.39" dur="4.02">of ours most of them are already sick</text>
  <text start="386.97" dur="2.07">and dying as it is I mean Hillary</text>
  <text start="388.41" dur="3.71">Clinton</text>
  <text start="389.04" dur="6.81">I don&amp;#39;t know how they&amp;#39;ve managed to</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="5.17">re-inflate her but she&amp;#39;s still waddling</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="4.29">around everywhere in her medical gown</text>
  <text start="397.29" dur="4.23">and barely surviving and and you know I</text>
  <text start="400.14" dur="4.26">haven&amp;#39;t seen any collapses or anything</text>
  <text start="401.52" dur="5.43">lately but frankly I hope you know I</text>
  <text start="404.4" dur="4.92">have no I have no problem with that she</text>
  <text start="406.95" dur="4.35">has done so much longer so many children</text>
  <text start="409.32" dur="3.99">and so much evil in this world I hope</text>
  <text start="411.3" dur="4.11">that they either take her to get lower</text>
  <text start="413.31" dur="4.02">that she&amp;#39;s gone soon of natural causes</text>
  <text start="415.41" dur="6.33">because that woman has done nothing but</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="7.68">cost this world such English hey I just</text>
  <text start="421.74" dur="4.74">did that huh on YouTube but of course I</text>
  <text start="425.01" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t call for violence I want this done</text>
  <text start="426.48" dur="5.43">legally I have great anger in my heart</text>
  <text start="429.69" dur="4.2">for those who are evil and those who</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="4.13">hurt people but you don&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="433.89" dur="4.65">violent to be angry you can still have</text>
  <text start="436.04" dur="5.68">logic and reason and compassion on your</text>
  <text start="438.54" dur="5.22">side and still be pissed off and I think</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s why people that have found this</text>
  <text start="443.76" dur="3.63">show to be attractive because they know</text>
  <text start="445.35" dur="3.63">I feel it but I don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="3.96">necessarily like get angry and beat my</text>
  <text start="448.98" dur="3.84">chest to make my point and I think</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="7.5">that&amp;#39;s you know that&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="7.65">this so we also have the seat continuing</text>
  <text start="458.85" dur="2.07">on from that I mean the bad guys are</text>
  <text start="460.47" dur="2.31">going down</text>
  <text start="460.92" dur="4.8">and talking about bad guys going down</text>
  <text start="462.78" dur="5.16">whether it be from the the bad health of</text>
  <text start="465.72" dur="5.61">the Karma for many decisions whether it</text>
  <text start="467.94" dur="4.98">be from Gitmo whether it be because the</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="3.48">court of public opinion has made them</text>
  <text start="472.92" dur="3.06">suicide themselves before they do it</text>
  <text start="474.81" dur="2.67">again well because I think that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="475.98" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of in them do</text>
  <text start="477.48" dur="6.42">that coming up just based on kind of</text>
  <text start="481.14" dur="5.7">logic we also have James Comey here</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="7.23">another psychopath full psychopath is</text>
  <text start="486.84" dur="6.24">lying he&amp;#39;s a good liar right and you</text>
  <text start="491.13" dur="3.78">know just the actions that he&amp;#39;s given us</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="3.24">so far i ranked him up there as a full</text>
  <text start="494.91" dur="4.32">psychopath I&amp;#39;m not obviously a</text>
  <text start="496.32" dur="5.88">psychologist or expert which means that</text>
  <text start="499.23" dur="4.08">I can actually ethically make judgments</text>
  <text start="502.2" dur="2.7">like that on the internet because</text>
  <text start="503.31" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="504.9" dur="3.09">unless they&amp;#39;ve actually seen the person</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="3.93">and of course they do that with sharp</text>
  <text start="507.99" dur="5.64">anyway the lefty activist ones</text>
  <text start="510.54" dur="3.7">former FBI director James Comey named in</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="2.8">sexual</text>
  <text start="514.24" dur="5.94">Rassman lawsuit filed by a group of</text>
  <text start="516.43" dur="5.909">former FBI recruits now that&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="3.84">I don&amp;#39;t know about that one but it looks</text>
  <text start="522.339" dur="4.19">like that Neetu stuff you guys tried to</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="6.12">use as a weapon against really more and</text>
  <text start="526.529" dur="6.281">and Trump himself it&amp;#39;s firing back on</text>
  <text start="530.14" dur="5.61">you looks like all the ladies out there</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="6.089">I finally had enough and they sense that</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="5.279">Trump is the the Trump era is the era of</text>
  <text start="538.899" dur="4.651">change and the time to strike much like</text>
  <text start="541.029" dur="6.031">I do I sense that now the bad guys are</text>
  <text start="543.55" dur="6.599">off balance those in power or a bit</text>
  <text start="547.06" dur="5.399">scattered and unfocused and I think now</text>
  <text start="550.149" dur="4.951">is a time where good things in the world</text>
  <text start="552.459" dur="4.681">can happen maybe we can get some some</text>
  <text start="555.1" dur="4.38">great social changes maybe we could get</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="4.47">the constitution reaffirmed I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="3.419">we can do some big things in this time</text>
  <text start="561.61" dur="4.229">though because the energy is there</text>
  <text start="562.899" dur="6.151">that&amp;#39;s a precious and rare thing in</text>
  <text start="565.839" dur="6.301">history we don&amp;#39;t want waste stuff you</text>
  <text start="569.05" dur="6.45">know energetics is what move mankind</text>
  <text start="572.14" dur="4.8">from you know living in caves to to</text>
  <text start="575.5" dur="4.1">making wheels to doing everything else</text>
  <text start="576.94" dur="6.6">people have good ideas to get excited</text>
  <text start="579.6" dur="5.979">that&amp;#39;s now the Supreme Court could</text>
  <text start="583.54" dur="3.299">intervene and DIMMs attempt to remove</text>
  <text start="585.579" dur="4.591">Trump from office</text>
  <text start="586.839" dur="4.62">Dershowitz says I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.17" dur="3.57">gonna have to I mean they don&amp;#39;t really</text>
