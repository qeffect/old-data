  <text start="153.58" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s one here called here&amp;#39;s why rip</text>
  <text start="156.37" dur="5.04">roaring inflation is inevitable okay</text>
  <text start="158.8" dur="5.1">this is by Tyler Durden ok inflation</text>
  <text start="161.41" dur="4.59">generally just means a lot more currency</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="5.64">being printed by the by the central bank</text>

  <text start="169.54" dur="6.06">into this authored by Charles Hugh Smith</text>
  <text start="172.39" dur="6.54">via of two mines block ok the stability</text>
  <text start="175.6" dur="4.86">of America&amp;#39;s status quo is illusory one</text>
  <text start="178.93" dur="3.39">of the enduring mysteries of the past</text>
  <text start="180.46" dur="3.33">decade is why inflation has remained</text>
  <text start="182.32" dur="2.79">tame while the central bank and</text>
  <text start="183.79" dur="3.42">government has pumped trillions of</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="4.62">dollars of newly created money into the</text>
  <text start="187.21" dur="5.04">economy millions of words have been</text>
  <text start="189.73" dur="4.05">written about this and so some shortcuts</text>
  <text start="192.25" dur="4.53">will have to be taken to make sense of</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="5.4">it in one essay let&amp;#39;s start with the</text>
  <text start="196.78" dur="4.02">basics one adding newly created money</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="3.6">but not generating new goods and</text>
  <text start="200.8" dur="4.65">services of the same value reduces the</text>
  <text start="202.78" dur="4.5">purchasing power of existing money to</text>
  <text start="205.45" dur="4.56">keep it simple say the economy of a</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="5.43">country is 20 trillion dollars hey the</text>
  <text start="210.01" dur="5.79">US GDP is 20 trillion and say its money</text>
  <text start="212.71" dur="5.85">supply is 10 trillion so banks and/or</text>
  <text start="215.8" dur="4.5">governments create two trillion dollars</text>
  <text start="218.56" dur="4.11">in new money but the value of goods and</text>
  <text start="220.3" dur="4.65">services only expands by 1 trillion so</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="4.2">that extra 1 trillion of newly created</text>
  <text start="224.95" dur="4.44">money which is either printed or</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="3.33">borrowed into existence time - the same</text>
  <text start="229.39" dur="2.7">thing for us</text>
  <text start="230.2" dur="3.6">you know we borrow that printed fake</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="3.99">money and we have to pay interest on it</text>
  <text start="233.8" dur="5.1">so continuing on sorry</text>
  <text start="236.08" dur="6.09">reduces the value of all existing money</text>
  <text start="238.9" dur="4.68">no to interject when you put money in</text>
  <text start="242.17" dur="3.06">the bank account or shove it under your</text>
  <text start="243.58" dur="3.96">mattress or keep it in your wallet and</text>
  <text start="245.23" dur="4.41">you wait a year you&amp;#39;ve lost money okay</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="3.84">that is inflation right not because your</text>
  <text start="249.64" dur="3.27">value of not because your dollars have</text>
  <text start="251.38" dur="2.94">gone down in number you may have gone up</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="2.64">like you may be getting like a point</text>
  <text start="254.32" dur="2.55">zero zero one percent interest or</text>
  <text start="255.55" dur="3.72">something and you&amp;#39;ve earned five cents</text>
  <text start="256.87" dur="3.6">but in reality the purchasing power has</text>
  <text start="259.27" dur="3.33">gone down okay</text>
  <text start="260.47" dur="4.53">hundred years ago and nickel would buy a</text>
  <text start="262.6" dur="6.21">soda and how much are they now</text>
  <text start="265" dur="4.26">now continuing on in effect the new</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="2.85">money</text>
  <text start="269.26" dur="4.29">Rob&amp;#39;s purchasing power from all existing</text>
  <text start="271.66" dur="3.51">money and those holding existing money</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="3.42">have lost purchasing power while the</text>
  <text start="275.17" dur="4.32">recipients of the new money receive</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="5.4">purchasing power they didn&amp;#39;t have prior</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="5.19">to receiving the new money we can see</text>
  <text start="282.37" dur="5.22">how this works by looking at a chart of</text>
  <text start="284.68" dur="4.68">GDP to debt as debt has soared and</text>
  <text start="287.59" dur="4.23">remember debt is new money that was</text>
  <text start="289.36" dur="5.7">loaned into existence GDP has risen at a</text>
  <text start="291.82" dur="6.6">much lower rate so the ratio of debt to</text>
  <text start="295.06" dur="4.8">GDP has skyrocketed and he does have a</text>
  <text start="298.42" dur="2.58">chart so check out the links below if</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="3.21">you guys want to see the article and</text>
  <text start="301" dur="5.1">actually read through and show you know</text>
  <text start="303.07" dur="3.45">see the the the infographics that go</text>
  <text start="306.1" dur="4.17">with it</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="5.49">to where inflation which is higher</text>
  <text start="310.27" dur="3.69">prices for the same item shows up</text>
  <text start="312.01" dur="4.17">depends on who gets the newly-created</text>
  <text start="313.96" dur="4.62">money the wealthy few are the wage</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="4.41">earning many as I have explained many</text>
  <text start="318.58" dur="4.47">times in our system all newly issued</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="5.97">money goes to banks finance Sears and</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="5.13">corporations the super wealthy few so</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="3.15">what do already wealthy people and</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="3.989">companies do with trillions and new</text>
  <text start="329.71" dur="4.59">money they buy assets stocks and bonds</text>
  <text start="332.169" dur="4.741">and real estate wage earners who receive</text>
  <text start="334.3" dur="4.56">new money tend to save some of it but</text>
  <text start="336.91" dur="3.36">they also spend some of it the super</text>
  <text start="338.86" dur="2.85">wealthy and corporations already own</text>
  <text start="340.27" dur="3.149">more stuff than they know what to do</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="3.6">with so they spend the new money on</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="5.131">income producing assets or stock</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="4.56">buybacks the net result of giving all of</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="3.66">the new money to the wealthy is the</text>
  <text start="349.87" dur="3.99">inflation of an asset bubble which is</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="4.2">precisely what happened in the past</text>
  <text start="353.86" dur="5.94">decade a real estate bubble corporate</text>
  <text start="356.41" dur="4.92">debt bubble stocks bubble we can see</text>
  <text start="359.8" dur="3.119">this bubble by comparing the value of</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="3.81">the stock market to the real economy as</text>
  <text start="362.919" dur="4.171">measured by GDP the higher the ratio of</text>
  <text start="365.14" dur="5.04">stocks to GDP the greater the bubble</text>
  <text start="367.09" dur="5.31">look ok so he has a chart here as well</text>
  <text start="370.18" dur="4.35">the current stock market bubble is the</text>
  <text start="372.4" dur="4.11">greatest in history exceeded only by the</text>
  <text start="374.53" dur="4.41">insanity of the last few months of the</text>
  <text start="376.51" dur="3.93">dot-com bubble when companies with very</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="4.289">little revenue and zero profits were</text>
  <text start="380.44" dur="5.67">valued in the billions of dollars now</text>
  <text start="383.229" dur="4.681">stocks are in a bubble period this is</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="3.059">the inevitable result of shoveling all</text>
  <text start="387.91" dur="3.21">the new money into the hands of the</text>
  <text start="389.169" dur="3.451">wealthy and corporations real-world</text>
  <text start="391.12" dur="2.82">inflation is certainly higher than</text>
  <text start="392.62" dur="3.299">official inflation but the real</text>
  <text start="393.94" dur="4.5">inflation which is higher prices for the</text>
