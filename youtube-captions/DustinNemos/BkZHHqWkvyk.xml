  <text start="17.43" dur="4.38">theory Giants and kind of some</text>
  <text start="18.84" dur="3.72">suppressed or alternative views of the</text>

  <text start="39.75" dur="3.899">taking the time to to sit down with me</text>
  <text start="41.7" dur="3.539">and have this conversation because this</text>
  <text start="43.649" dur="3.721">is one of those topics that people know</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="3.961">I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m interested mostly in the</text>
  <text start="47.37" dur="3.27">politics the economics you know all of</text>
  <text start="49.2" dur="4.14">that stuff and the holistic health</text>
  <text start="50.64" dur="4.02">things but the suppressed history</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s something going on they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="54.66" dur="3.539">telling us they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re hiding books</text>
  <text start="56.52" dur="4.589">from the Bible they&amp;#39;re taking things out</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="4.471">they&amp;#39;re putting other narratives and</text>
  <text start="61.109" dur="4.651">they&amp;#39;re trying to control our reality</text>
  <text start="62.67" dur="7.94">and on the other hand they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="65.76" dur="8.16">shaping this sort of a matrix of just</text>
  <text start="70.61" dur="6.16">deception and they&amp;#39;ve had giant</text>
  <text start="73.92" dur="6.239">skeletons go missing they&amp;#39;ve had ruins</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="5.4">kind of yet are not ruins but megalithic</text>
  <text start="80.159" dur="4.021">structures in some cases obviously</text>
  <text start="82.17" dur="3.72">clearly built by something non-human</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="3.869">because we still can&amp;#39;t duplicate that</text>
  <text start="85.89" dur="4.68">today and in many cases we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="88.049" dur="5.941">thousands of skeletons just go missing</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="5.339">and elongated skulls Giants whatever so</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="4.11">you know this is a topic that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="95.909" dur="3.991">interested in although you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="3.6">even know what I don&amp;#39;t know so I may let</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="3.81">you kind of helped me to structure this</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="3.599">as we go but where did where should we</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="6.119">start where does it where does this</text>
  <text start="105.299" dur="6.331">story began oh well could we could start</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="4.231">you know somewhere in the beginning of</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="4.46">one of the parallel chapters here which</text>
  <text start="114.06" dur="5.37">is you mentioned the suppression of</text>
  <text start="116.09" dur="6.27">information and that&amp;#39;s been going on</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="8.07">you know since Inc was put to paper or</text>
  <text start="122.36" dur="7.509">stylistic lay man has always had a</text>
  <text start="127.5" dur="5.79">propensity to try to record things so</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="6.09">whether cataclysms wars</text>
  <text start="133.29" dur="6.32">art you know poetry things like that but</text>
  <text start="135.959" dur="8.791">then Wars happen conflicts happen</text>
  <text start="139.61" dur="7.36">invasions genocide pandemics and what</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="3.599">happens is we have we have survivors or</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="4.019">or to put it a better way we have</text>
  <text start="148.349" dur="5.581">victors and if it&amp;#39;s come along and they</text>
  <text start="150.989" dur="5.101">look at what has been recorded and they</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="5.58">decide for one reason or another usually</text>
  <text start="156.09" dur="5.28">to preserve their own power that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="5.58">going to protect to their society</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="6">against this information one good</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="27.989">example would be the Council of Nicaea</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="29.07">in 325 is had at least through the</text>
  <text start="193.079" dur="6.921">reading of available manuscripts really</text>
  <text start="196.44" dur="6.32">shared an inspirational story and</text>
  <text start="200" dur="7.03">probably drawn a flock to them of</text>
  <text start="202.76" dur="8.25">sizable economic power Council of Nicaea</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="7.349">occurs and the Emperor Constantine</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="6.67">decides what we&amp;#39;re gonna do is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="214.379" dur="6.48">going to canonize we&amp;#39;re going to approve</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="7.32">a set of documents to be put together in</text>
  <text start="220.859" dur="7.051">a library which we&amp;#39;ll call the biblia or</text>
  <text start="225" dur="6.18">the bible and only these books are going</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="4.799">to be approved and this is the story</text>
  <text start="231.18" dur="3.899">that we&amp;#39;re gonna that we&amp;#39;re gonna tell</text>
  <text start="232.709" dur="5.101">and really a lot of things couldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="5.071">be agreed upon even with that council so</text>
  <text start="237.81" dur="4.679">some of the Metropolitan Bush bishops</text>
  <text start="240.15" dur="3.72">said you know what we we think that</text>
  <text start="242.489" dur="3.39">maybe these other books should be</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="3.839">included because there were some 1500</text>
  <text start="245.879" dur="3.961">manuscripts at the time that were fairly</text>
  <text start="247.709" dur="5.64">well preserved not just Isaiah but lots</text>
  <text start="249.84" dur="6.66">and lots of writings of Thomas and Enoch</text>
  <text start="253.349" dur="6.031">and various writings and and the church</text>
  <text start="256.5" dur="5.76">that is to say the council the one with</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="4.86">the army decided no I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262.26" dur="3.54">gonna put those books in there and so</text>
  <text start="264.24" dur="2.88">the Metropolitan Bishop said well you</text>
  <text start="265.8" dur="3.33">know we</text>
  <text start="267.12" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;ve got a pretty big rock on this ring</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="5.34">here and got a pretty big flock and I</text>
  <text start="271.74" dur="4.92">think we&amp;#39;re gonna withdraw so at that</text>
  <text start="274.47" dur="5.01">time they took sixty or so of these</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="5.91">bishops out beheaded them and the rest</text>
  <text start="279.48" dur="5.67">of them fell right into the line 66</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="5.599">books we have in the biblio the library</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="6.66">today arranged in order of size not even</text>
  <text start="288.169" dur="6.401">chronologically are the scriptures that</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="6.48">we have today the rest of the books um</text>
  <text start="294.57" dur="6.03">almost 2,000 different manuscripts were</text>
  <text start="298.29" dur="4.59">scattered to the winds and in fact they</text>
  <text start="300.6" dur="5.43">had a a fair amount of let&amp;#39;s just call</text>
  <text start="302.88" dur="5.039">it Fahrenheit 451 cruise going out there</text>
  <text start="306.03" dur="5.85">either burning them or gathering them up</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="7.171">and and putting him in the Vatican so</text>
  <text start="311.88" dur="7.349">the matrix the the actual framework of</text>
  <text start="315.09" dur="7.98">reality that becomes this belief that</text>
  <text start="319.229" dur="6.871">somehow we as humans somewhere along the</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="4.8">way got separated from God we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="326.1" dur="4.44">the right to talk to him he thinks were</text>
  <text start="327.87" dur="4.95">a bunch of filthy rags and the only way</text>
  <text start="330.54" dur="4.74">back to him as luck would have it would</text>
  <text start="332.82" dur="5.75">be through the very church that controls</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="6.05">the doctrine if you don&amp;#39;t go this way</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="5.17">sorry you&amp;#39;re not getting into heaven and</text>
  <text start="341.33" dur="5.77">it&amp;#39;s kind of been that way for about</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="6.63">2,000 years you&amp;#39;re referring to the</text>
  <text start="347.1" dur="4.92">Apocrypha right well there is a group</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="4.799">called the Apocrypha but there are also</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="3.75">extra apocryphal writings there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="2.551">Kabbalah</text>
  <text start="355.77" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s the Sepher Yetzirah there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="5.16">Popol Vuh they&amp;#39;re all the writings of</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="6.69">the Maya that also are not included in</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="6.21">that Apocrypha that tend to have quite a</text>
  <text start="366.24" dur="8.51">few bits of very high technology</text>
  <text start="369.09" dur="8.49">movement of planets forces of nature and</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="5.4">irrefutable rules of the universe that</text>
  <text start="377.58" dur="4.98">are also not included in those writings</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="4.42">so I know that if you can control the</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="4.979">stories that people hear then you can</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="5.099">control people so it it makes sense</text>
  <text start="387.539" dur="6.351">media does today it&amp;#39;s no different than</text>
  <text start="389.669" dur="6.721">it was then what five or six men who</text>
  <text start="393.89" dur="6.79">kind of all know each other and agree on</text>
  <text start="396.39" dur="6.93">what people should know and they run all</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="5.82">TV stations all the cable stations all</text>
  <text start="403.32" dur="5.58">almost all the online information that</text>
  <text start="406.5" dur="6.12">we get the tech giant&amp;#39;s and all the</text>
  <text start="408.9" dur="5.91">radio so you&amp;#39;re right they control what</text>
  <text start="412.62" dur="5.87">we hear what we see and what we should</text>
  <text start="414.81" dur="6.66">know now am I correct in thinking that</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="6.16">there was one I think it was Ethiopia</text>
  <text start="421.47" dur="4.38">that kept to full Apocrypha at least not</text>
  <text start="424.65" dur="2.609">on about all the others but at least</text>
  <text start="425.85" dur="5.33">they Apocrypha itself within the</text>
  <text start="427.259" dur="7.771">official Bible that the Ethiopian Church</text>
  <text start="431.18" dur="8.29">Europian is a good reference and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="435.03" dur="6.84">even believed that they possess the ark</text>
  <text start="439.47" dur="6.39">for Ark of the Covenant for at least a</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="6.21">period of time not what you know modern</text>
  <text start="445.86" dur="6.9">times we would we think about Ethiopia</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="6.75">we think about you know eggs and famine</text>
  <text start="452.76" dur="5.85">and droughts that&amp;#39;s what we think of the</text>
  <text start="454.83" dur="6">Ethiopia today but in times past this</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="4.77">may have been the actual land where the</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="5.19">wise men came from to visit Jesus they</text>
  <text start="463.38" dur="4.08">knew all about the signs they knew how</text>
  <text start="466.02" dur="3.3">to read the heavens they knew what was</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="6.019">gonna happen and their priests were in</text>
  <text start="469.32" dur="6.24">tune Wow okay so you know obviously</text>
  <text start="473.479" dur="4.541">fast-forward to today that the the</text>
  <text start="475.56" dur="4.74">church the Catholic Church is incredibly</text>
  <text start="478.02" dur="4.709">corrupt engaged in evil at the highest</text>
  <text start="480.3" dur="4.14">levels and covering upset evil and I</text>
  <text start="482.729" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t know about others but for me it</text>
  <text start="484.44" dur="4.5">seems kind of blatantly obvious and</text>
  <text start="486.449" dur="5.161">transparent well truth be told that</text>
  <text start="488.94" dur="6.539">corruption has always been there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="6.299">been there since day one what is being</text>
  <text start="495.479" dur="5.011">discovered now is the level of</text>
  <text start="497.909" dur="6.781">corruption but you gotta understand if</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="6.87">you go back to these early satanic texts</text>
  <text start="504.69" dur="4.979">there are certain oaths and covenants</text>
  <text start="507.36" dur="7.53">that are made in order to enter into</text>
  <text start="509.669" dur="6.99">this this practice and I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="514.89" dur="4.529">like to go too deep into this subject</text>
  <text start="516.659" dur="5.88">because it it makes me you know very</text>
  <text start="519.419" dur="5.281">negative but part of those oaths and</text>
  <text start="522.539" dur="5.191">covenant covenants have to do with the</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="8.1">murder of innocent blood the violation</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="6.599">of children and even you know the</text>
  <text start="532.8" dur="4.709">corruption of</text>
  <text start="534.329" dur="4.5">procreation and that&amp;#39;s as nice as I can</text>
  <text start="537.509" dur="3.351">put it sir</text>
  <text start="538.829" dur="7.17">all of that is beginning to come out</text>
  <text start="540.86" dur="7.269">yuck what has happened basically is</text>
  <text start="545.999" dur="5.041">exactly what was predicted to happen</text>
  <text start="548.129" dur="6.3">that in the last days little pockets of</text>
  <text start="551.04" dur="4.919">light would begin springing up and then</text>
  <text start="554.429" dur="3.51">these pockets of light would begin</text>
  <text start="555.959" dur="5.94">communicating one with another and the</text>
  <text start="557.939" dur="5.52">light would then become proliferate and</text>
  <text start="561.899" dur="3.9">it would proliferate in such a way that</text>
  <text start="563.459" dur="5.13">the darkness would be unaware of it and</text>
  <text start="565.799" dur="4.861">what what happened is and I wrote a book</text>
  <text start="568.589" dur="4.021">about this a series of books called the</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="4.829">birth trilogy is they would eventually</text>
  <text start="572.61" dur="5.669">become a grand division where the you</text>
  <text start="575.489" dur="4.171">know it used to be where you could live</text>
  <text start="578.279" dur="3.9">the life you wanted to live until</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="4.679">Saturday night and then Sunday morning</text>
  <text start="582.179" dur="4.861">you go to church put on your tie take</text>
  <text start="584.339" dur="3.96">your kids take some communion everything</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="3.149">would be forgiven in Monday morning</text>
  <text start="588.299" dur="4.561">would start all over again with a fresh</text>
  <text start="590.189" dur="5.37">slate and that&amp;#39;s in the days when the</text>
  <text start="592.86" dur="4.349">line was kind of very narrow but in the</text>
  <text start="595.559" dur="3.75">last days what happens is that line</text>
  <text start="597.209" dur="4.68">begins to get wider and wider and wider</text>
  <text start="599.309" dur="4.08">and now you have to kind of run back and</text>
  <text start="601.889" dur="5.28">forth from one side of the line to the</text>
  <text start="603.389" dur="5.91">other and what&amp;#39;s happening is the beings</text>
  <text start="607.169" dur="5.01">of light are being separated from the</text>
  <text start="609.299" dur="4.38">beings of darkness and and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="612.179" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re seeing now you could call it</text>
  <text start="613.679" dur="6.27">divisiveness you can call it whatever</text>
  <text start="616.079" dur="6.151">you want but good is good and bad is bad</text>
  <text start="619.949" dur="5.64">good or there&amp;#39;s right and there&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s good and there&amp;#39;s evil it used to</text>
  <text start="625.589" dur="6.78">be we kind of you know mix the two</text>
  <text start="628.29" dur="6.539">together with discretion now there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="632.369" dur="6.66">mixing you&amp;#39;re on one side or on you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.829" dur="7.62">on the other and everybody sees that you</text>
  <text start="639.029" dur="7.29">know I I&amp;#39;ve sort of intuited that there</text>
  <text start="642.449" dur="6.18">is some sort of higher purpose it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="646.319" dur="4.5">just political power it&amp;#39;s some sort of</text>
  <text start="648.629" dur="4.77">like evil cult the best way I could</text>
  <text start="650.819" dur="4.35">describe it or you know luciferianism</text>
  <text start="653.399" dur="4.201">that word has been thrown around a lot</text>
  <text start="655.169" dur="5.25">in the last two years you know I cover</text>
  <text start="657.6" dur="4.669">what&amp;#39;s going on at that level as best as</text>
  <text start="660.419" dur="3.87">I can I cover what they&amp;#39;re doing to</text>
  <text start="662.269" dur="5.801">massive quantities of child trafficking</text>
  <text start="664.289" dur="6.721">and even rituals sacrifice</text>
  <text start="668.07" dur="5.16">is torture things like this and it is</text>
  <text start="671.01" dur="3.75">definitely a negative topic but it is</text>
  <text start="673.23" dur="3.6">like you know it is like you said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.76" dur="4.62">waking a lot of people up and there</text>
  <text start="676.83" dur="4.65">seems to be some sort of principle of</text>
  <text start="679.38" dur="5.07">inversion within luciferianism or</text>
  <text start="681.48" dur="5.1">Satanism and and they didn&amp;#39;t spring up</text>
  <text start="684.45" dur="5.25">lately you got to go back and look at</text>
  <text start="686.58" dur="4.92">the conversation between well what</text>
  <text start="689.7" dur="6.36">happened in the garden to beat which may</text>
  <text start="691.5" dur="6.78">have we know but it&amp;#39;s clear that Adam</text>
  <text start="696.06" dur="4.92">was placed in this world with all these</text>
  <text start="698.28" dur="5.73">animals and he was tasked to to name</text>
  <text start="700.98" dur="5.52">them all and you know that period of</text>
  <text start="704.01" dur="4.56">that that sixth day who knows how long</text>
  <text start="706.5" dur="4.59">it was a day a thousand years who knows</text>
  <text start="708.57" dur="5.91">Adam was immortal there was no weather</text>
  <text start="711.09" dur="5.85">to speak of and he was alone until the</text>
  <text start="714.48" dur="5.25">end if any also had lots of</text>
  <text start="716.94" dur="5.37">conversations with God during this but</text>
  <text start="719.73" dur="5.55">at the end of that day at the very end</text>
  <text start="722.31" dur="5.22">of the day he is evidently put to sleep</text>
  <text start="725.28" dur="4.71">a rib is taken from him a compatible</text>
  <text start="727.53" dur="6.78">being is cloned from his rib up at the</text>
  <text start="729.99" dur="7.04">opposite sex evidently surrogate &amp;#39;add on</text>
  <text start="734.31" dur="5.52">an on another world to another female</text>
  <text start="737.03" dur="5.35">born raised and then brought back to</text>
  <text start="739.83" dur="4.29">earth and given to him at the end of the</text>
  <text start="742.38" dur="4.56">sixth day and then God says we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="5.04">take a rest for a day so they leave for</text>
  <text start="746.94" dur="6.18">a period of time during that time</text>
  <text start="749.16" dur="7.23">Lucifer comes to that world to Eden to</text>
  <text start="753.12" dur="6.18">the garden he at first goes to Adam and</text>
  <text start="756.39" dur="5.07">Adam already you know having been</text>
  <text start="759.3" dur="5.27">schooled by God for who knows how long</text>
  <text start="761.46" dur="5.55">that period I mean very wise very</text>
  <text start="764.57" dur="6.7">stalwart being an in his own right</text>
  <text start="767.01" dur="6.27">basically tells him look no sale so he</text>
  <text start="771.27" dur="4.29">says well fine so he goes looking for</text>
  <text start="773.28" dur="4.29">Eve now we don&amp;#39;t know how long that took</text>
  <text start="775.56" dur="3.87">maybe it took the afternoon maybe it</text>
  <text start="777.57" dur="4.65">took all summer who knows but eventually</text>
  <text start="779.43" dur="6.75">he finds Eve and it begins a long</text>
  <text start="782.22" dur="6.3">process of beguiling her now there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="786.18" dur="6.56">lot of speculation as to what that means</text>
  <text start="788.52" dur="9.54">did he talk her into eating an apple or</text>
  <text start="792.74" dur="8.47">did he rape her and my feelings are</text>
  <text start="798.06" dur="3.81">based on what events we&amp;#39;ve seen happen</text>
  <text start="801.21" dur="3.03">since then</text>
  <text start="801.87" dur="5.159">that the latter is true she was pregnant</text>
  <text start="804.24" dur="7.289">with Lucifer&amp;#39;s child Wow</text>
  <text start="807.029" dur="7.891">Brenda Adam saying look I&amp;#39;m undone I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="811.529" dur="5.191">undone the serpent beguiled me I told me</text>
  <text start="814.92" dur="4.01">I was beautifully whatever he brushed my</text>
  <text start="816.72" dur="4.16">hair rubbed my feet whatever it was</text>
  <text start="818.93" dur="6.01">anyway</text>
  <text start="820.88" dur="9.61">evidently Adam loved her so much he said</text>
  <text start="824.94" dur="7.92">well if you go I go so he also father&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.49" dur="6.36">a child with her she&amp;#39;s now pregnant with</text>
  <text start="832.86" dur="6.8">two fetuses they&amp;#39;re born as twins the</text>
  <text start="836.85" dur="7.05">firstborn is Lucifer&amp;#39;s the second out is</text>
  <text start="839.66" dur="7.69">Adam&amp;#39;s and Lucifer&amp;#39;s child kills Adams</text>
  <text start="843.9" dur="5.4">child now at that point we have Cain on</text>
  <text start="847.35" dur="8.34">the earth we have Adam and we have Eve</text>
  <text start="849.3" dur="8.63">on the earth and God comes to the Garden</text>
  <text start="855.69" dur="5.04">of Eden just before that event and</text>
  <text start="857.93" dur="4.33">basically looks for them and can&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="860.73" dur="3.21">them and they say well look we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="862.26" dur="5.34">hiding ourselves because we were naked</text>
  <text start="863.94" dur="5.49">and so God figures all right I already</text>
  <text start="867.6" dur="4.65">know what&amp;#39;s happened here why don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="869.43" dur="6.24">tell me the story and Adam says well the</text>
  <text start="872.25" dur="7.2">woman you gave me you know she gave me</text>
  <text start="875.67" dur="6.63">of the fruit and I did he and then God</text>
  <text start="879.45" dur="5.19">turns to even says Eve what happened</text>
  <text start="882.3" dur="5.28">here and she said well the serpent</text>
  <text start="884.64" dur="5.16">beguiled me and so God says all right</text>
  <text start="887.58" dur="3.83">Lucifer come out and and let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="889.8" dur="4.32">about this what have you been doing</text>
  <text start="891.41" dur="4.99">allegedly Lucifer says look I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="894.12" dur="5.4">doing the same thing that&amp;#39;s been done on</text>
  <text start="896.4" dur="4.439">other worlds I&amp;#39;ve been giving of the</text>
  <text start="899.52" dur="6.48">fruit of the knowledge of good and evil</text>
  <text start="900.839" dur="7.351">to them and God loses a temper and says</text>
  <text start="906" dur="4.35">well because you&amp;#39;ve done this I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="908.19" dur="2.55">curse you you&amp;#39;re gonna crawl upon your</text>
  <text start="910.35" dur="2.34">belly</text>
  <text start="910.74" dur="4.74">thus thou shalt eat all the days of thy</text>
  <text start="912.69" dur="6.33">life and Lucifer gets mad right back it</text>
  <text start="915.48" dur="7.62">says well if you curse me then I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="919.02" dur="6.18">take the body is that you make for Adam</text>
  <text start="923.1" dur="5.359">and Eve and all his children and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="925.2" dur="7.009">going to possess them with my people and</text>
  <text start="928.459" dur="5.711">God says this thing and this is the most</text>
  <text start="932.209" dur="3.701">overlooked thing in the scriptures I</text>
  <text start="934.17" dur="6.78">think God says</text>
  <text start="935.91" dur="7.89">I&amp;#39;m gonna put enmity between you and the</text>
  <text start="940.95" dur="6.15">seed of the woman that means you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="943.8" dur="6.72">possess them unless they give you</text>
  <text start="947.1" dur="5.16">permission he will have power to crush</text>
  <text start="950.52" dur="7.86">your head you&amp;#39;ll have power to bruise</text>
  <text start="952.26" dur="9.57">his heel though from that time forward</text>
  <text start="958.38" dur="7.41">Lucifer and Cain and all of his genetic</text>
  <text start="961.83" dur="8.31">ability to invite the spirits of Lucifer</text>
  <text start="965.79" dur="6.99">into unto earth as living beings they</text>
  <text start="970.14" dur="6.72">battle ever since the first born against</text>
  <text start="972.78" dur="6.06">the second born for until now and now</text>
  <text start="976.86" dur="4.26">the seed of Lucifer and the seed of Adam</text>
  <text start="978.84" dur="4.47">are alive and well on the earth and this</text>
  <text start="981.12" dur="5.7">is the war that we&amp;#39;ve been having for</text>
  <text start="983.31" dur="7.31">all of humanity&amp;#39;s time so the Nephilim</text>
  <text start="986.82" dur="7.37">and which are the servants of Lucifer</text>
  <text start="990.62" dur="8.35">have one mission and that is to convince</text>
  <text start="994.19" dur="7.69">the souls of men to choose Lucifer as</text>
  <text start="998.97" dur="5.22">their way of life that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1001.88" dur="6.38">they&amp;#39;re all about let me close my office</text>
  <text start="1004.19" dur="4.07">door because we&amp;#39;re gonna go ahead</text>
  <text start="1014.95" dur="10.45">interesting topics so was gonna say work</text>
  <text start="1024.08" dur="3.72">so we&amp;#39;re getting into like the Book of</text>
  <text start="1025.4" dur="4.62">Enoch and you know I I did a deep dive</text>
  <text start="1027.8" dur="5.66">on that topic not too long ago and it</text>
  <text start="1030.02" dur="7.98">was really interesting the story goes</text>
  <text start="1033.46" dur="6.04">basically that so many angels or</text>
  <text start="1038" dur="4.86">Watchers or grigory or whatever you want</text>
  <text start="1039.5" dur="7.08">to call them came to the planet sorry</text>
  <text start="1042.86" dur="8.88">there&amp;#39;s my dogs began to to breed with</text>
  <text start="1046.58" dur="8.52">women and we get these half half angel</text>
  <text start="1051.74" dur="7.92">you know quasi spiritual entities which</text>
  <text start="1055.1" dur="5.58">were not of God&amp;#39;s plan and therefore you</text>
  <text start="1059.66" dur="2.61">know we kind of talked a little bit</text>
  <text start="1060.68" dur="3.21">about it before the show you said they</text>
  <text start="1062.27" dur="4.38">they went around the the Well of Souls</text>
  <text start="1063.89" dur="5.97">so they they were not part of nature&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1066.65" dur="4.59">plan at all and at first</text>
  <text start="1069.86" dur="4.38">everything was fine then they became</text>
  <text start="1071.24" dur="5.7">kind of evil sort of in some cases at</text>
  <text start="1074.24" dur="5.37">least started eating people and and</text>
  <text start="1076.94" dur="5.43">things got pretty bad and then you know</text>
  <text start="1079.61" dur="6.09">the the the pain and and the anguish of</text>
  <text start="1082.37" dur="7.17">mankind apparently even got up to to God</text>
  <text start="1085.7" dur="6">and he had to do something and I was</text>
  <text start="1089.54" dur="3.72">kind of wondering if and this is</text>
  <text start="1091.7" dur="4.08">probably kind of going ahead a little</text>
  <text start="1093.26" dur="4.53">bit with the whole flood situation was</text>
  <text start="1095.78" dur="6.149">that an attempt to wipe out the dirty</text>
  <text start="1097.79" dur="7.74">DNA and was that an attempt to to stop</text>
  <text start="1101.929" dur="5.521">this problem well you have to wonder</text>
  <text start="1105.53" dur="3.87">about the omniscient of a known</text>
  <text start="1107.45" dur="5.37">all-knowing being a being that can see</text>
  <text start="1109.4" dur="5.58">through time he already knew that even</text>
  <text start="1112.82" dur="6.21">if he you know cleanse the earth and</text>
  <text start="1114.98" dur="7.23">were managed to have an arc with</text>
  <text start="1119.03" dur="7.17">protected DNA on it that that you know</text>
  <text start="1122.21" dur="6.78">nature finds a way when when Eden came</text>
  <text start="1126.2" dur="5.43">to rest let&amp;#39;s just call it the water</text>
  <text start="1128.99" dur="4.83">planet even with with Noah ship on it</text>
  <text start="1131.63" dur="7.7">when it came to rest and merged with</text>
  <text start="1133.82" dur="8.97">this world and that boat came ashore</text>
  <text start="1139.33" dur="6.13">seven months after the Cataclysm had</text>
  <text start="1142.79" dur="4.62">begun they stepped off the boat they</text>
  <text start="1145.46" dur="5.91">weren&amp;#39;t the only people on this world</text>
  <text start="1147.41" dur="10.95">there were other peoples on the world</text>
  <text start="1151.37" dur="10.799">and Adams eighth or Noah&amp;#39;s eighth then</text>
  <text start="1158.36" dur="6.84">began to breed with their humans that</text>
  <text start="1162.169" dur="5.161">were on this earth now Noah and that</text>
  <text start="1165.2" dur="3.21">class of being they lived close to a</text>
  <text start="1167.33" dur="3.78">thousand years</text>
  <text start="1168.41" dur="5.31">this was their genetics the beings on</text>
  <text start="1171.11" dur="4.38">this world man and woman the lower atom</text>
  <text start="1173.72" dur="4.14">which was placed on this world in the</text>
  <text start="1175.49" dur="4.95">first creation of Genesis they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1177.86" dur="3.09">live that long and when the two came</text>
  <text start="1180.44" dur="3">together</text>
  <text start="1180.95" dur="5.25">I guess the older the longer lifespan</text>
  <text start="1183.44" dur="5.52">shortened and the early lifespan</text>
  <text start="1186.2" dur="5.07">lengthened and so we kind of had like</text>
  <text start="1188.96" dur="6.57">dropping ice into warm water we just</text>
  <text start="1191.27" dur="7.649">assumed a median temperature but the</text>
  <text start="1195.53" dur="6.51">Nephilim returned they returned after</text>
  <text start="1198.919" dur="4.711">the flood of Noah and it says you know</text>
  <text start="1202.04" dur="4.35">clearly that the</text>
  <text start="1203.63" dur="5.28">the last days and the end times things</text>
  <text start="1206.39" dur="5.7">will be as they were in the days of Noah</text>
  <text start="1208.91" dur="7.17">and that&amp;#39;s what we see right now we see</text>
  <text start="1212.09" dur="6.62">this corruption of the DNA now I I know</text>
  <text start="1216.08" dur="6.69">it&amp;#39;s difficult to say well there are</text>
  <text start="1218.71" dur="7.45">beings on this earth who whose souls</text>
  <text start="1222.77" dur="5.46">were born evil they were born evil they</text>
  <text start="1226.16" dur="2.82">came from evil they went around the Well</text>
  <text start="1228.23" dur="2.79">of Souls</text>
  <text start="1228.98" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve been reincarnating here for</text>
  <text start="1231.02" dur="4.889">centuries and centuries and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1233.45" dur="4.979">always been evil they get killed off in</text>
  <text start="1235.909" dur="4.5">wars because you know man rises up the</text>
  <text start="1238.429" dur="4.081">mountain army they go against they go</text>
  <text start="1240.409" dur="5.971">battle that them and they defeat them</text>
  <text start="1242.51" dur="7.169">but then because we&amp;#39;re this human class</text>
  <text start="1246.38" dur="5.789">with a reincarnate and they begin to</text>
  <text start="1249.679" dur="4.801">multiply again and they build up their</text>
  <text start="1252.169" dur="4.981">forces again and they come again every</text>
  <text start="1254.48" dur="5.49">one or two hundred years we have this</text>
  <text start="1257.15" dur="7.8">war against this evil and we&amp;#39;re at that</text>
  <text start="1259.97" dur="7.439">point again and every nation on earth I</text>
  <text start="1264.95" dur="5.28">I report on this every single week on my</text>

  <text start="1274.419" dur="8.861">hundreds and hundreds of people innocent</text>
  <text start="1277.82" dur="8.729">people are killed well there certainly</text>
  <text start="1283.28" dur="7.35">seems to be an attempt to corrupt Souls</text>
  <text start="1286.549" dur="8.061">to to to manipulate us into our baser</text>
  <text start="1290.63" dur="6.81">natures you know and if we go back to</text>

  <text start="1305.12" dur="4.95">leave them into mischief down the road</text>
  <text start="1306.679" dur="6.661">and then as I understand it the modern</text>

  <text start="1524.98" dur="8.72">built these things my answer is we did</text>
  <text start="1530.49" dur="6.7">we built those things to withstand</text>

  <text start="1544.69" dur="8.25">about mmm interesting theory okay so you</text>
  <text start="1550.12" dur="6.24">know we got into the the Book of Enoch</text>
  <text start="1552.94" dur="4.8">for that we kind of covered the creation</text>

  <text start="1622.69" dur="4.29">across multiple disconnected continents</text>

  <text start="1626.98" dur="4.289">eating people different things like that</text>
  <text start="1629.139" dur="4.47">elongated skulls Egyptian you know</text>
  <text start="1631.269" dur="3.99">hieroglyphics that show you know even</text>
  <text start="1633.609" dur="4.53">the children of the gods were about the</text>
  <text start="1635.259" dur="4.5">same size as an adult man you know and</text>
  <text start="1638.139" dur="3.691">they had the elongated skulls and the</text>
  <text start="1639.759" dur="6.42">funky hats how does all of that play</text>
  <text start="1641.83" dur="8.069">into this well I had a conversation with</text>
  <text start="1646.179" dur="8.57">a friend of mine la Marzulli and his is</text>
  <text start="1649.899" dur="8.1">Peru sir and they went down to Peru and</text>
  <text start="1654.749" dur="5.321">of course they saw the elongated skulls</text>
  <text start="1657.999" dur="5.221">that were on display down there but they</text>
  <text start="1660.07" dur="4.89">are they&amp;#39;re kind of like if they ask a</text>
  <text start="1663.22" dur="3.6">lot of questions and so they were taken</text>
  <text start="1664.96" dur="4.98">to a place that tourists don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1666.82" dur="5.969">get to see it&amp;#39;s outside of the city</text>
  <text start="1669.94" dur="6.989">actually out into the the dunes in the</text>
  <text start="1672.789" dur="9.27">desert area and what they described to</text>
  <text start="1676.929" dur="7.801">me was a killing field these beings of</text>
  <text start="1682.059" dur="5.34">this class and I held one of the skulls</text>
  <text start="1684.73" dur="5.669">a replica of the skulls in my hand so</text>
  <text start="1687.399" dur="5.041">these are not humanoid well they are</text>
  <text start="1690.399" dur="5.821">humanoid but they&amp;#39;re not human DNA</text>
  <text start="1692.44" dur="6.27">there&amp;#39;s something else they were herded</text>
  <text start="1696.22" dur="5.429">together gathered together in a group</text>
  <text start="1698.71" dur="6.059">and they were driven out of the city</text>
  <text start="1701.649" dur="5.91">into these into the desert as a group</text>
  <text start="1704.769" dur="4.98">and then they were beaten to death all</text>
  <text start="1707.559" dur="4.46">of them their skulls were broken their</text>
  <text start="1709.749" dur="5.821">bones were broken and they were left on</text>
  <text start="1712.019" dur="5.26">the sand and their bones are still there</text>
  <text start="1715.57" dur="4.349">to this day you can sift through with</text>
  <text start="1717.279" dur="4.77">your hands and just pick up handfuls of</text>
  <text start="1719.919" dur="5.64">bones of these people they took them out</text>
  <text start="1722.049" dur="6.181">and they killed them all because maybe</text>
  <text start="1725.559" dur="5.19">they were so different but it does not</text>
  <text start="1728.23" dur="4.919">appear that they fought it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1730.749" dur="4.411">appear that they were warlike they were</text>
  <text start="1733.149" dur="5.461">just different</text>
  <text start="1735.16" dur="5.25">and they were rejected by society and</text>
  <text start="1738.61" dur="5.22">they were they were taken out and they</text>
  <text start="1740.41" dur="6.24">were exterminated I don&amp;#39;t think that the</text>
  <text start="1743.83" dur="5.45">Giants based on the research that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1746.65" dur="5.76">been able to do have a long lifespan</text>
  <text start="1749.28" dur="6.64">they have a tendency because of maybe</text>
  <text start="1752.41" dur="6.15">gravity in this world or the lack of the</text>
  <text start="1755.92" dur="5.85">ability to sustain a very large body on</text>
  <text start="1758.56" dur="6.6">this world they began early in their</text>
  <text start="1761.77" dur="4.86">life to become infirm and the records</text>
  <text start="1765.16" dur="5.1">show that sometimes they would actually</text>
  <text start="1766.63" dur="6.45">walk into the sea and drown themselves</text>
  <text start="1770.26" dur="4.41">rather than be for instance paralyzed</text>
  <text start="1773.08" dur="5.76">from the waist down because of arthritis</text>
  <text start="1774.67" dur="7.53">in their spine or suffer some kind of</text>

  <text start="1784.18" dur="3.96">do it they&amp;#39;d rather commit suicide and</text>
  <text start="1786.04" dur="5.67">there are all kinds of explorers</text>
  <text start="1788.14" dur="7.64">Magellan others that ran into tribes of</text>

  <text start="1801.13" dur="4.65">ran into a group of course his group was</text>
  <text start="1804.04" dur="4.14">armed and they were able to fight them</text>
  <text start="1805.78" dur="5.4">off but evidently these people were like</text>
  <text start="1808.18" dur="6.66">12 to 18 feet tall according to Magellan</text>
  <text start="1811.18" dur="7.23">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s definitely giant class we</text>

  <text start="1890.02" dur="5.55">this is independent of Rh negative this</text>
  <text start="1892.39" dur="5.58">is just giantism I met several people</text>

  <text start="1901.54" dur="9.629">really know where the Rh negative gene</text>

  <text start="1918.36" dur="4.24">yeah I&amp;#39;m not a geneticist but as I</text>
  <text start="1920.98" dur="5.1">understand it it&amp;#39;s some sort of proof</text>
  <text start="1922.6" dur="6.69">that there was a tempering or a hybrid</text>
  <text start="1926.08" dur="7.5">situation going on and not not naturally</text>
  <text start="1929.29" dur="7.259">evolved at all the wrong word it would</text>
  <text start="1933.58" dur="6.39">be more like crossbreeding a hybrid or</text>
  <text start="1936.549" dur="6.691">something like you take a Jinni and a</text>
  <text start="1939.97" dur="6.9">jack or I mean a donkey and a horse and</text>
  <text start="1943.24" dur="5.51">you make a male or female mule that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1946.87" dur="6.21">hybrid they&amp;#39;re sterile they cannot</text>
  <text start="1948.75" dur="5.799">divide but a crossbreed is something</text>
  <text start="1953.08" dur="4.8">quite a bit different that&amp;#39;s like you</text>
  <text start="1954.549" dur="5.701">would take you know a shih tzu and a</text>
  <text start="1957.88" dur="7.02">shar-pei and breathe it together</text>
  <text start="1960.25" dur="9.049">that&amp;#39;s a crossbreed now how that ended</text>
  <text start="1964.9" dur="7.14">up creating this rhesus factor that</text>
  <text start="1969.299" dur="5.851">makes women build antibodies against</text>
  <text start="1972.04" dur="5.79">their own children I don&amp;#39;t know it is</text>
  <text start="1975.15" dur="6.7">pretty interesting though that it was</text>
  <text start="1977.83" dur="6.87">the royal bloodline that tended to have</text>
  <text start="1981.85" dur="5.34">more of this so they would have one or</text>
  <text start="1984.7" dur="5.19">maybe two children but the third child</text>
  <text start="1987.19" dur="4.2">she would kill off her own fetus because</text>
  <text start="1989.89" dur="5.34">she was carrying antibodies against the</text>
  <text start="1991.39" dur="7.02">blood of her child though this is this</text>
  <text start="1995.23" dur="6.35">is maybe a good reason why we see very</text>

  <text start="2042.52" dur="4.2">magnetosphere we don&amp;#39;t really know if it</text>
  <text start="2044.65" dur="6.33">has a core or not but we know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2046.72" dur="6.66">not generating its own magnetic field we</text>
  <text start="2050.98" dur="4.49">do know Earth has a very strong magnetic</text>
  <text start="2053.38" dur="5.91">field around it it&amp;#39;s what allows</text>
  <text start="2055.47" dur="6.34">microbial life to exist in our world if</text>
  <text start="2059.29" dur="5.22">it wasn&amp;#39;t there the planet would be</text>
  <text start="2061.81" dur="6.65">pretty sterile I&amp;#39;m not even sure that it</text>
  <text start="2064.51" dur="6.899">would sustain life the question has been</text>
  <text start="2068.46" dur="4.99">theorized because we don&amp;#39;t really have a</text>
  <text start="2071.409" dur="5.371">way to drill into the center of the</text>
  <text start="2073.45" dur="5.34">planet but it&amp;#39;s been theorized that we</text>
  <text start="2076.78" dur="4.35">live on this giant molten ball in space</text>
  <text start="2078.79" dur="7.05">and that there&amp;#39;s some dynamo pumping</text>
  <text start="2081.13" dur="7.58">action of magma in the center that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2085.84" dur="8.04">what you&amp;#39;ll find in the decks books</text>
  <text start="2088.71" dur="8.13">recent evidence and I mean from 2006</text>
  <text start="2093.88" dur="7.8">until now which is pretty recent</text>
  <text start="2096.84" dur="8.62">speaking we&amp;#39;ve made and been forced to</text>
  <text start="2101.68" dur="8.7">make a lot of decisions and conduct a</text>
  <text start="2105.46" dur="6.87">lot of experiments to find out why that</text>
  <text start="2110.38" dur="4.47">has happened first of all we took a</text>
  <text start="2112.33" dur="5.64">satellite images of the earth and we</text>
  <text start="2114.85" dur="5.37">noticed that the Aurora&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="2117.97" dur="4.4">appear over one pole or the other they</text>
  <text start="2120.22" dur="6.42">appear over both poles at the same time</text>
  <text start="2122.37" dur="5.83">that kind of precludes the idea that the</text>
  <text start="2126.64" dur="3.78">Aurora&amp;#39;s are caused by the solar wind</text>
  <text start="2128.2" dur="6.39">because that only strikes one side of</text>
  <text start="2130.42" dur="6.419">the planet at a time it also appears</text>
  <text start="2134.59" dur="4.199">when there&amp;#39;s no really strong soul</text>
  <text start="2136.839" dur="4.71">wind or a lot of charged particles</text>
  <text start="2138.789" dur="5.58">coming from the Sun not when the Sun is</text>
  <text start="2141.549" dur="5.79">very quiet like solar cycle 24 right now</text>
  <text start="2144.369" dur="6.96">we still have massive Aurora&amp;#39;s over both</text>
  <text start="2147.339" dur="7.65">poles so in 2006 they launched the</text>
  <text start="2151.329" dur="5.52">famous probe which was a a satellite</text>
  <text start="2154.989" dur="3.421">that was sent up a nose gun to a Senate</text>
  <text start="2156.849" dur="3.48">with five satellites and it the five</text>
  <text start="2158.41" dur="4.23">satellites orbited at different</text>
  <text start="2160.329" dur="5.301">altitudes around the earth and they were</text>
  <text start="2162.64" dur="6.719">designed specifically to look for an</text>
  <text start="2165.63" dur="6.79">extraterrestrial source for the Aurora&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2169.359" dur="6.031">and what they discovered was something</text>
  <text start="2172.42" dur="6.049">they call a cosmic bullet I I kid you</text>
  <text start="2175.39" dur="6.119">not that&amp;#39;s what they call it this</text>
  <text start="2178.469" dur="6.971">dimensional explosion occurred above the</text>
  <text start="2181.509" dur="6.33">earth between satellites 3 and 4 and of</text>
  <text start="2185.44" dur="4.139">course the explosion went out 360</text>
  <text start="2187.839" dur="3.63">degrees in all directions so it passed</text>
  <text start="2189.579" dur="5.67">satellites 4 and 5 and went out into</text>
  <text start="2191.469" dur="5.971">space they passed satellites 3 2 &amp;amp; 1</text>
  <text start="2195.249" dur="7.02">and when it struck our atmosphere there</text>
  <text start="2197.44" dur="7.379">was the aurora so JPL publishes the</text>
  <text start="2202.269" dur="6.51">paper that the Aurora&amp;#39;s are caused by</text>
  <text start="2204.819" dur="7.081">cosmic bullets okay so I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="2208.779" dur="5.55">confused about that one but what about</text>
  <text start="2211.9" dur="6.24">the idea that there are massive</text>
  <text start="2214.329" dur="6.301">entrances at the poles and because what</text>
  <text start="2218.14" dur="4.169">it seemed to indicate was not cosmic</text>
  <text start="2220.63" dur="5.129">bullets at all it seemed to indicate</text>
  <text start="2222.309" dur="6.69">that we have kind of an electric jet an</text>
  <text start="2225.759" dur="7.381">electric jet is where gravitational</text>
  <text start="2228.999" dur="8.51">bodies eject high-velocity particles out</text>
  <text start="2233.14" dur="7.729">of the poles of their magnetosphere</text>
  <text start="2237.509" dur="7.48">quasars do what pulsars do it and</text>
  <text start="2240.869" dur="6.61">planets do it so that seemed to make a</text>
  <text start="2244.989" dur="5.401">lot more sense but they needed to</text>
  <text start="2247.479" dur="5.37">conduct more experiments to see if that</text>
  <text start="2250.39" dur="5.04">was true now one of the pieces of</text>
  <text start="2252.849" dur="5.22">evidence we had laying around for a long</text>
  <text start="2255.43" dur="5.96">time and no one really looked at it for</text>
  <text start="2258.069" dur="5.28">a while and that was the seismograms</text>
  <text start="2261.39" dur="4.869">every single time we have an earthquake</text>
  <text start="2263.349" dur="5.22">on one side of the planet the vibrations</text>
  <text start="2266.259" dur="4.471">go through the planet to the other side</text>
  <text start="2268.569" dur="5.641">of the planet and the</text>
  <text start="2270.73" dur="5.57">USGS the system of listening stations</text>
  <text start="2274.21" dur="6">around the picks up those vibrations</text>
  <text start="2276.3" dur="7.59">well after a couple million of these</text>
  <text start="2280.21" dur="6.75">things they decided to analyze them and</text>
  <text start="2283.89" dur="4.93">crunch them you know using software</text>
  <text start="2286.96" dur="6.149">using imaging software that kind of did</text>
  <text start="2288.82" dur="6.779">a cat scan of the earth and this was</text>
  <text start="2293.109" dur="4.861">done by dr. Y sessions at Washington</text>
  <text start="2295.599" dur="4.051">University in st. Louis they went</text>
  <text start="2297.97" dur="5.369">through six hundred thousand of these</text>
  <text start="2299.65" dur="6.449">seismograms and they produced an image</text>
  <text start="2303.339" dur="6.381">of the inside of the planet oh not only</text>
  <text start="2306.099" dur="8.131">that they picked up the damping waves of</text>
  <text start="2309.72" dur="7.48">water crashing on the shore inside the</text>
  <text start="2314.23" dur="5.46">planet they found evidence of another</text>
  <text start="2317.2" dur="6.93">ocean underneath the Atlantic Ocean</text>
  <text start="2319.69" dur="6.86">inside the crust crashing waves just</text>
  <text start="2324.13" dur="4.56">like you see you know on Virginia Beach</text>
  <text start="2326.55" dur="4.99">the same thing was happening on the</text>
  <text start="2328.69" dur="5.629">inside of the planet so that led us to</text>
  <text start="2331.54" dur="5.13">believe that maybe the crust is about</text>
  <text start="2334.319" dur="5.411">900 miles thick maybe it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2336.67" dur="4.83">gravitational body by itself so we have</text>
  <text start="2339.73" dur="3.599">gravity on the surface we have gravity</text>
  <text start="2341.5" dur="3.48">on the inside just you know like you</text>
  <text start="2343.329" dur="4.26">were standing on China on the other side</text>
  <text start="2344.98" dur="6.839">of the world everything&amp;#39;s kind of drawn</text>
  <text start="2347.589" dur="7.02">toward the center of the crest and that</text>
  <text start="2351.819" dur="4.951">meant that the pole areas the polar</text>
  <text start="2354.609" dur="7.01">areas were very thin this crust was</text>
  <text start="2356.77" dur="8.46">thinner and if that was the case then we</text>
  <text start="2361.619" dur="6.25">realized that possibly those two oceans</text>
  <text start="2365.23" dur="3.96">are blending somewhere there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="2367.869" dur="4.141">opening in the crust</text>
  <text start="2369.19" dur="6.57">and it&amp;#39;s probably in these polar regions</text>
  <text start="2372.01" dur="8.43">it became very evident in 2007 when</text>
  <text start="2375.76" dur="5.099">there was a crazy arrangement of the jet</text>
  <text start="2380.44" dur="3.09">stream</text>
  <text start="2380.859" dur="5.701">we had some Arctic warming that we</text>
  <text start="2383.53" dur="5.49">hadn&amp;#39;t seen before and a big piece of</text>
  <text start="2386.56" dur="4.47">ice broke off because the wind was</text>
  <text start="2389.02" dur="5.73">stressing it and the temperatures were</text>
  <text start="2391.03" dur="9.289">such this giant piece of ice broke off</text>
  <text start="2394.75" dur="8.13">and in 2008 as luck would have it the</text>
  <text start="2400.319" dur="4.371">oceanographic institute or the</text>
  <text start="2402.88" dur="5.35">association decided to sir</text>
  <text start="2404.69" dur="7.44">raise that year stingrays like stingrays</text>
  <text start="2408.23" dur="6.119">and manta rays they respond to</text>
  <text start="2412.13" dur="4.38">environmental stress in the ocean a lot</text>
  <text start="2414.349" dur="4.381">like frogs do in the rainforest so they</text>
  <text start="2416.51" dur="4.079">survey them every four or five years to</text>
  <text start="2418.73" dur="6.03">see how many mutations there are and</text>
  <text start="2420.589" dur="9.2">they did that and normally they see 20</text>
  <text start="2424.76" dur="8.579">or 25 new species of rays but in 2008</text>
  <text start="2429.789" dur="5.971">there were over 1,500 and they were</text>
  <text start="2433.339" dur="5.96">fully mature these weren&amp;#39;t slight</text>
  <text start="2435.76" dur="7.839">alterations in the Rays these were huge</text>
  <text start="2439.299" dur="7.871">mature well developed beasts of the deep</text>
  <text start="2443.599" dur="6.331">and that blew them away and other things</text>
  <text start="2447.17" dur="6.84">like frilled sharks and dorsal porpoises</text>
  <text start="2449.93" dur="7.409">are dorsal squids which we have fossils</text>
  <text start="2454.01" dur="6.569">we don&amp;#39;t have any live ones but they</text>
  <text start="2457.339" dur="6.75">started to catch live ones fully mature</text>
  <text start="2460.579" dur="6.27">live frilled sharks which are blind they</text>
  <text start="2464.089" dur="5.581">they don&amp;#39;t exist in our oceans but we</text>
  <text start="2466.849" dur="6.2">were netting them anyway so it&amp;#39;s evident</text>
  <text start="2469.67" dur="6.75">that when that piece of ice broke off it</text>
  <text start="2473.049" dur="6.131">provided access for the two oceans to</text>
  <text start="2476.42" dur="5.21">blend and that&amp;#39;s when we got the idea we</text>
  <text start="2479.18" dur="6.629">wanted to do this North Pole expedition</text>
  <text start="2481.63" dur="7.51">to try to find that vent in the sea</text>
  <text start="2485.809" dur="8.071">bottom and sample the water at that vent</text>
  <text start="2489.14" dur="7.35">to see it makes sense that an ocean not</text>
  <text start="2493.88" dur="4.199">exposed to our Sun but exposed to some</text>
  <text start="2496.49" dur="4.65">inner source of energy would have</text>
  <text start="2498.079" dur="9.48">completely different chemistry that our</text>
  <text start="2501.14" dur="8.34">ocean and we I&amp;#39;m never going in the</text>
  <text start="2507.559" dur="4.29">ocean again I just I saw a movie</text>
  <text start="2509.48" dur="4.74">recently called the Meg where they had</text>
  <text start="2511.849" dur="4.68">went down so deep then they they opened</text>
  <text start="2514.22" dur="3.899">up something where this Megalodon giant</text>
  <text start="2516.529" dur="3.81">prehistoric shark came out started</text>
  <text start="2518.119" dur="4.68">eating everybody it was basically just a</text>
  <text start="2520.339" dur="4.651">jaws film but after hearing this that</text>
  <text start="2522.799" dur="3.27">you know they it&amp;#39;s maybe that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="2524.99" dur="7.89">they got the idea for the movie I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2526.069" dur="8.311">know I like yeah Ruby Rose yeah and they</text>
  <text start="2532.88" dur="4.86">were both both very good in that movie</text>
  <text start="2534.38" dur="7.83">as corny as it was I thought it was well</text>
  <text start="2537.74" dur="6.06">yeah I like that okay so you you had</text>
  <text start="2542.21" dur="3.78">mentioned the name the first guy that</text>
  <text start="2543.8" dur="3.84">would went up there to the polls what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2545.99" dur="4.41">his name again</text>
  <text start="2547.64" dur="6">well of course she had Admiral Byrd but</text>
  <text start="2550.4" dur="5.25">that was 26 he did the north pole 1938</text>
  <text start="2553.64" dur="4.8">and he flew over the South Pole and</text>
  <text start="2555.65" dur="5.73">there&amp;#39;s some controversy about it he was</text>
  <text start="2558.44" dur="6.169">you know an aviation hero to be sure and</text>
  <text start="2561.38" dur="6.45">it was no easy job getting his his</text>
  <text start="2564.609" dur="4.871">airplane up to Spitsbergen and getting</text>
  <text start="2567.83" dur="5.16">it on the beach putting it back together</text>
  <text start="2569.48" dur="6.119">and then flying that route but it was</text>
  <text start="2572.99" dur="4.47">done it was an age where world records</text>
  <text start="2575.599" dur="6.061">were being broken like every other month</text>
  <text start="2577.46" dur="7.35">it was done again by another aviator</text>
  <text start="2581.66" dur="5.4">and it took him longer and he didn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="2584.81" dur="5.61">any of the things that Admiral Byrd said</text>
  <text start="2587.06" dur="6.33">he saw so he claimed that Admiral Byrd</text>
  <text start="2590.42" dur="5.22">kind of got off course and flew over you</text>
  <text start="2593.39" dur="5.16">know Canada instead of the North Pole</text>
  <text start="2595.64" dur="5.729">but the one thing we know about Admiral</text>
  <text start="2598.55" dur="8.4">Byrd he was probably the best in the</text>
  <text start="2601.369" dur="9.72">world at using no I&amp;#39;ve barely heard of</text>
  <text start="2606.95" dur="5.88">them so yeah</text>
  <text start="2611.089" dur="5.401">twenty-five hundred feet in almost</text>
  <text start="2612.83" dur="6.42">whiteout conditions so to to say that he</text>
  <text start="2616.49" dur="6.23">could locate his position exactly using</text>
  <text start="2619.25" dur="7.8">that second while flying it&amp;#39;s a stretch</text>
  <text start="2622.72" dur="5.95">okay so you know what about what do you</text>
  <text start="2627.05" dur="3.87">think about all of these secret bases</text>
  <text start="2628.67" dur="4.74">and and you know there were even rumors</text>
  <text start="2630.92" dur="4.71">of a Nazi excursion down there and still</text>
  <text start="2633.41" dur="4.32">maybe even ongoing and developing higher</text>
  <text start="2635.63" dur="3.42">technologies things like that but at the</text>
  <text start="2637.73" dur="2.85">very least we know that there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="2639.05" dur="3.059">sort of secret military bases and</text>
  <text start="2640.58" dur="4.05">projects and stuff up there under the</text>
  <text start="2642.109" dur="4.411">ice well the one thing you learn about</text>
  <text start="2644.63" dur="5.09">me is I&amp;#39;m a scientist</text>
  <text start="2646.52" dur="6">I like the stories I like the personal</text>
  <text start="2649.72" dur="5.98">testimonies those are what we consider</text>
  <text start="2652.52" dur="5.089">facts but we like to have corroborating</text>
  <text start="2655.7" dur="7.649">evidence yes</text>
  <text start="2657.609" dur="9.131">photograph film in 1945 we&amp;#39;re in high</text>
  <text start="2663.349" dur="6.081">jump took place they had the capability</text>
  <text start="2666.74" dur="4.91">of taking film of gathering evidence of</text>
  <text start="2669.43" dur="4.48">capturing you know prisoners</text>
  <text start="2671.65" dur="4.27">these were all battle-hardened troops</text>
  <text start="2673.91" dur="5.24">that allegedly went down there all fresh</text>
  <text start="2675.92" dur="6.03">from World War two led by Admiral Byrd</text>
  <text start="2679.15" dur="7.36">something something could have been</text>
  <text start="2681.95" dur="8.01">brought back so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s speculative</text>
  <text start="2686.51" dur="5.37">but I I do know that the Nazis were</text>
  <text start="2689.96" dur="4.65">highly advanced of a lot of things the</text>
  <text start="2691.88" dur="4.95">nuclear triggers that we used on arrow</text>
  <text start="2694.61" dur="7.38">Sherman Nagasaki were probably German</text>
  <text start="2696.83" dur="7.44">made these people were very very good</text>
  <text start="2701.99" dur="5.49">engineers and there are lots and lots of</text>
  <text start="2704.27" dur="5.07">u-boats that were unaccounted for so it</text>
  <text start="2707.48" dur="3.24">is quite possible that they made their</text>
  <text start="2709.34" dur="3.66">way down there it was kind of out of</text>
  <text start="2710.72" dur="4.56">harm&amp;#39;s way they thought they could you</text>

  <text start="2720.62" dur="4.41">tremendous amount of resources I&amp;#39;ve I</text>

  <text start="2727.07" dur="5.52">degrees down there in the wintertime</text>
  <text start="2728.47" dur="6.55">mm-hmm well you know the the the</text>
  <text start="2732.59" dur="5.7">conspiracy theory is that there are</text>
  <text start="2735.02" dur="5.55">heated places under the ice from I guess</text>
  <text start="2738.29" dur="4.62">natural heat vents or thermal vents of</text>
  <text start="2740.57" dur="3.99">some kind and they were able to create</text>
  <text start="2742.91" dur="4.68">some sort of an underground living there</text>
  <text start="2744.56" dur="5.13">and we&amp;#39;ve seen more recently people like</text>
  <text start="2747.59" dur="4.2">John Kerry even make little pilgrimages</text>
  <text start="2749.69" dur="5.4">down there and I&amp;#39;ve seen images where</text>
  <text start="2751.79" dur="5.28">the the pole kind of where you would</text>
  <text start="2755.09" dur="6.21">expect Admiral Byrd&amp;#39;s giant hole to be</text>

  <text start="2764.12" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;ve like pasted clouds with little</text>
  <text start="2766.37" dur="3.84">square images like on the edges of them</text>

  <text start="2773.81" dur="4.41">couldn&amp;#39;t agree more there&amp;#39;s I have some</text>
  <text start="2776.33" dur="4.23">friends that are down there trying to</text>
  <text start="2778.22" dur="4.65">make an attempt right now at Olson and</text>
  <text start="2780.56" dur="5.01">this girlfriend are down there right now</text>
  <text start="2782.87" dur="5.55">as we speak trying to get to the South</text>

  <text start="2788.42" dur="5.91">I&amp;#39;m gonna see him in March and I will</text>
  <text start="2790.25" dur="5.55">get the story the North Pole is a little</text>
  <text start="2794.33" dur="4.32">bit different in the sense that it</text>
  <text start="2795.8" dur="7.02">doesn&amp;#39;t have a continent with ice on it</text>
  <text start="2798.65" dur="6.72">it&amp;#39;s water with ice on it</text>
  <text start="2802.82" dur="4.89">and one of my ancestors</text>
  <text start="2805.37" dur="5.79">sir James Ross was the one that</text>
  <text start="2807.71" dur="8.07">discovered the North Magnetic Pole on my</text>
  <text start="2811.16" dur="6.24">grandmother&amp;#39;s side Ross family and of</text>
  <text start="2815.78" dur="3.54">course the first time he didn&amp;#39;t make it</text>
  <text start="2817.4" dur="3.84">he got caught in the ice it froze too</text>
  <text start="2819.32" dur="3.41">fast and it crushed his ship so they</text>
  <text start="2821.24" dur="5.4">offloaded their stuff on the ice</text>
  <text start="2822.73" dur="5.53">wintered somewhere around San Joseph</text>
  <text start="2826.64" dur="5.34">Islands and they were discovered in the</text>
  <text start="2828.26" dur="5.85">spring and yeah but then he raised the</text>
  <text start="2831.98" dur="4.8">money and did it again and this time he</text>
  <text start="2834.11" dur="5.22">did find the North Magnetic Pole in 1831</text>
  <text start="2836.78" dur="7.65">he also discovered something else a</text>
  <text start="2839.33" dur="10.23">little tiny seagull that flies north for</text>
  <text start="2844.43" dur="8.13">the winner not possible just for that</text>
  <text start="2849.56" dur="7.14">seagull to nest on the ice in the winter</text>
  <text start="2852.56" dur="6.36">it goes someplace warm now I spoke to</text>
  <text start="2856.7" dur="6.45">the world&amp;#39;s leading ornithologist in</text>
  <text start="2858.92" dur="7.5">Scotland and they have no idea where the</text>
  <text start="2863.15" dur="5.79">rascal winters to this day it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="2866.42" dur="4.98">small you can&amp;#39;t put a radio transmitter</text>
  <text start="2868.94" dur="6.42">on it because it&amp;#39;s evidently is hundreds</text>
  <text start="2871.4" dur="5.46">of miles away from any land and so a</text>
  <text start="2875.36" dur="4.44">radio is not gonna do any good</text>
  <text start="2876.86" dur="5.43">there&amp;#39;s no satellites that that can be</text>
  <text start="2879.8" dur="4.98">accessed that are polar satellites so</text>
  <text start="2882.29" dur="5.55">this little bird just has been tracked</text>
  <text start="2884.78" dur="5.13">and here we are you know in 2018 we</text>
  <text start="2887.84" dur="5.58">still don&amp;#39;t know where this bird winters</text>
  <text start="2889.91" dur="7.11">so it&amp;#39;s evident there are warm places at</text>
  <text start="2893.42" dur="7.44">the poles where animals like that and</text>
  <text start="2897.02" dur="6.96">probably people can exist you know I had</text>
  <text start="2900.86" dur="4.68">this theory it&amp;#39;s probably silly and I</text>
  <text start="2903.98" dur="5.33">don&amp;#39;t know if the technology is quite</text>
  <text start="2905.54" dur="6.57">ready for it yet but we we crowdsource a</text>
  <text start="2909.31" dur="4.6">thousands of drones like if you go to to</text>
  <text start="2912.11" dur="3.78">China they&amp;#39;ve banned fireworks in</text>
  <text start="2913.91" dur="4.53">certain places but they do these massive</text>
  <text start="2915.89" dur="4.56">displays in the air with thousands of</text>
  <text start="2918.44" dur="4.53">coordinated drones why can&amp;#39;t we just</text>
  <text start="2920.45" dur="4.59">send them up there and then see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2922.97" dur="3.96">going on with with thousands of cameras</text>
  <text start="2925.04" dur="5.37">well we could but those things don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2926.93" dur="5.22">have much range they could only fly for</text>
  <text start="2930.41" dur="3.72">about 40 minutes at a time you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2932.15" dur="4.41">talking about something now what we have</text>
  <text start="2934.13" dur="4.59">done is we went to the company that</text>
  <text start="2936.56" dur="5.27">produces the helium balloons that are</text>
  <text start="2938.72" dur="6.24">used by high schools you know to send</text>
  <text start="2941.83" dur="9.039">iPhones up to 100,000 feet a big picture</text>
  <text start="2944.96" dur="8.01">and we asked them if we could create</text>
  <text start="2950.869" dur="4.351">some lighter-than-air drones that</text>
  <text start="2952.97" dur="4.17">wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily go up to a hundred</text>
  <text start="2955.22" dur="5.58">thousand feet but maybe go up to say</text>
  <text start="2957.14" dur="7.68">five or six thousand feet float across</text>
  <text start="2960.8" dur="7.17">the ice record what they can and then at</text>
  <text start="2964.82" dur="4.86">a prescribed location the balloon pops</text>
  <text start="2967.97" dur="4.379">at parachutes to the ground you</text>
  <text start="2969.68" dur="7.41">recovered the camera and see what it</text>
  <text start="2972.349" dur="7.171">sees and we have a we have a kind of a</text>
  <text start="2977.09" dur="5.46">budget for putting several of these</text>
  <text start="2979.52" dur="4.77">things in place we have to do when the</text>
  <text start="2982.55" dur="3.99">wind is right so that it carries it</text>
  <text start="2984.29" dur="6.15">across this ten thousand square mile</text>
  <text start="2986.54" dur="6.3">area that we want to survey and we would</text>
  <text start="2990.44" dur="5.25">do it during the summer time but it</text>
  <text start="2992.84" dur="6.09">would still take a fair amount of ice</text>
  <text start="2995.69" dur="7.82">rated hull boats because this has to be</text>
  <text start="2998.93" dur="4.58">done at about 86 degrees north and</text>
  <text start="3003.599" dur="3.971">unfortunately there&amp;#39;s only one company</text>
  <text start="3005.589" dur="5.131">that has ships that can go that far</text>
  <text start="3007.57" dur="5.61">north and that&amp;#39;s Murmansk shipping</text>
  <text start="3010.72" dur="7.28">company and they have new boats now that</text>
  <text start="3013.18" dur="7.679">can make this trip to 86 degrees north</text>
  <text start="3018" dur="5.23">then Norwegians will only go to 80</text>
  <text start="3020.859" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s as far north as they go and those</text>
  <text start="3023.23" dur="5.34">are ice rated holes but they&amp;#39;re not ice</text>
  <text start="3024.849" dur="7.26">breakers i it&amp;#39;s just so difficult to</text>
  <text start="3028.57" dur="5.49">recover once the thing parachutes into</text>
  <text start="3032.109" dur="3.721">the water you you have to find it</text>
  <text start="3034.06" dur="3.93">because it&amp;#39;s heading for the roughest</text>
  <text start="3035.83" dur="7.11">seas on the planet we&amp;#39;re talking now in</text>
  <text start="3037.99" dur="7.29">story swells wow I had no idea was that</text>
  <text start="3042.94" dur="6.45">bad you go to the North Sea they have</text>
  <text start="3045.28" dur="7.17">oil rigs that are probably 300 feet off</text>
  <text start="3049.39" dur="7.65">the water and the waves crash against</text>
  <text start="3052.45" dur="6.63">the bottom of those rigs oh wow okay so</text>
  <text start="3057.04" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s scary territory I don&amp;#39;t know why</text>
  <text start="3059.08" dur="3.99">somebody even in today&amp;#39;s world but</text>
  <text start="3061.3" dur="3.21">especially back in your ancestors days</text>
  <text start="3063.07" dur="5.13">would actually make that track that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3064.51" dur="7.2">suicidal but Wow the he must have had</text>
  <text start="3068.2" dur="4.48">some courage what if and this is just</text>
  <text start="3071.71" dur="2.08">kind of an idea that just</text>
  <text start="3072.68" dur="4.11">popped in my head but what if you were</text>
  <text start="3073.79" dur="4.65">to chain these balloons and then feed</text>
  <text start="3076.79" dur="3.65">back through without having to go and</text>
  <text start="3078.44" dur="4.56">and pick them up</text>
  <text start="3080.44" dur="4.75">you know bounce the signal maybe and try</text>
  <text start="3083" dur="4.14">to pull some images still have to get</text>
  <text start="3085.19" dur="5.909">repeaters close enough I mean you could</text>
  <text start="3087.14" dur="5.969">probably put a 20 or 30 watt transmitter</text>
  <text start="3091.099" dur="4.74">on these things and get them up there</text>
  <text start="3093.109" dur="5.181">but then you&amp;#39;d have to get a repeater to</text>
  <text start="3095.839" dur="6.841">grab that signal and bounce it to where</text>
  <text start="3098.29" dur="5.89">you know maybe to Finland or s annulus</text>
  <text start="3102.68" dur="3.78">of islands or something like that and</text>
  <text start="3104.18" dur="3.54">tried to pick up the signal still it</text>
  <text start="3106.46" dur="4.95">would be it would be difficult to</text>
  <text start="3107.72" dur="4.92">receive audio laughter yeah sounds like</text>
  <text start="3111.41" dur="3.959">it could be done but we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="3112.64" dur="5.669">hundreds of miles away that&amp;#39;s way over</text>
  <text start="3115.369" dur="4.411">the curvature of the earth yeah well I</text>
  <text start="3118.309" dur="3.181">you know the technology is getting</text>
  <text start="3119.78" dur="3.569">better every year I imagine it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3121.49" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s getting easier and easier and</text>
  <text start="3123.349" dur="1.561">eventually we&amp;#39;re gonna figure something</text>
  <text start="3124.25" dur="8.819">out</text>
  <text start="3124.91" dur="9.439">so yeah what about you know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3133.069" dur="3.181">covered a lot of things that were</text>
  <text start="3134.349" dur="5.5">suppressed in history and false</text>
  <text start="3136.25" dur="5.91">narratives and we&amp;#39;ve covered you know</text>
  <text start="3139.849" dur="4.141">some really interesting stuff what else</text>
  <text start="3142.16" dur="3.24">have we left out like I said I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3143.99" dur="3.24">know what I don&amp;#39;t know in this area</text>
  <text start="3145.4" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s a few things that I found very</text>
  <text start="3147.23" dur="4.349">interesting and I&amp;#39;ve seen enough to know</text>
  <text start="3149.48" dur="4.319">that we&amp;#39;re being lied to and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3151.579" dur="3.931">more out there and that&amp;#39;s kind of where</text>
  <text start="3153.799" dur="4.141">I approach this from I just I just want</text>
  <text start="3155.51" dur="4.049">to get to the bottom of it well a lot of</text>
  <text start="3157.94" dur="4.619">people do and the universities are doing</text>
  <text start="3159.559" dur="5.49">some pretty interesting work one of the</text>
  <text start="3162.559" dur="5.49">things we&amp;#39;ve always wondered about is</text>
  <text start="3165.049" dur="8.75">you know what is the core of the earth</text>
  <text start="3168.049" dur="10.05">look like what what is it and about 2008</text>
  <text start="3173.799" dur="10.931">spectrographic our spectroscopy got to</text>
  <text start="3178.099" dur="10.681">the point where we could measure atomic</text>
  <text start="3184.73" dur="5.849">frequency is coming from molecules now</text>
  <text start="3188.78" dur="6.18">we have catalogs of these we have we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3190.579" dur="6.211">had those since the late 50s frequencies</text>
  <text start="3194.96" dur="4.98">that different elements put off like</text>
  <text start="3196.79" dur="5.519">iron and silicon and carbon and bond</text>
  <text start="3199.94" dur="4.95">links between carbon and oxygen and</text>
  <text start="3202.309" dur="4.05">carbon and hydrogen we know these are</text>
  <text start="3204.89" dur="3.959">like little guitar strings</text>
  <text start="3206.359" dur="5.72">we know exactly what frequencies they</text>
  <text start="3208.849" dur="5.51">put out and spectra graphically we use</text>
  <text start="3212.079" dur="6.311">spectrometers all the time to analyze</text>
  <text start="3214.359" dur="7.36">everything from blood using these things</text>
  <text start="3218.39" dur="5.669">well they employed this technology to</text>
  <text start="3221.719" dur="5.79">amend what the core of the earth is made</text>
  <text start="3224.059" dur="8.101">of and what they&amp;#39;re getting is a very</text>
  <text start="3227.509" dur="6.18">clean spike on the element iron so</text>
  <text start="3232.16" dur="7.319">they&amp;#39;ve determined that the core is</text>
  <text start="3233.689" dur="9.15">actually a giant iron crystal now that</text>
  <text start="3239.479" dur="7.23">does raise some questions because the</text>
  <text start="3242.839" dur="5.91">frequency that is putting out it it</text>
  <text start="3246.709" dur="5.22">indicates that this iron is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3248.749" dur="7.02">somewhere around 6,000 degrees C which</text>
  <text start="3251.929" dur="8.76">means it&amp;#39;s a crystal it&amp;#39;s one big iron</text>
  <text start="3255.769" dur="7.26">crystal that that condition can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="3260.689" dur="4.59">be verified empirically so what we have</text>
  <text start="3263.029" dur="5.01">to do is duplicate it in lab to see if</text>
  <text start="3265.279" dur="8.54">that frequency at that temperature with</text>
  <text start="3268.039" dur="8.79">iron and so Carnegie science created a</text>
  <text start="3273.819" dur="6.91">special apparatus called a diamond anvil</text>
  <text start="3276.829" dur="5.64">these are industrial diamonds and what</text>
  <text start="3280.729" dur="4.411">they do is they have two of them one</text>
  <text start="3282.469" dur="5.64">above the other and they put a sample of</text>
  <text start="3285.14" dur="5.76">iron in between them and then they crush</text>
  <text start="3288.109" dur="6.031">them hydraulically with a giant</text>
  <text start="3290.9" dur="6.209">hydraulic ram and then they shoot lasers</text>
  <text start="3294.14" dur="5.939">through the diamond to heat up the iron</text>
  <text start="3297.109" dur="5.4">to that temperature and what they were</text>
  <text start="3300.079" dur="5.91">able to do is duplicate the pressure and</text>
  <text start="3302.509" dur="6">temperature of that iron crystal in the</text>
  <text start="3305.989" dur="5.46">center of the earth and when they open</text>
  <text start="3308.509" dur="7.76">the anvil and looked at it they had this</text>
  <text start="3311.449" dur="7.61">gorgeous black diamond that was made</text>
  <text start="3316.269" dur="7.48">under these pressures and temperatures</text>
  <text start="3319.059" dur="9.851">so they&amp;#39;re 99% sure that the core of the</text>
  <text start="3323.749" dur="7.171">earth is one giant iron crystal at six</text>
  <text start="3328.91" dur="5.069">thousand degrees C which means it would</text>
  <text start="3330.92" dur="5.059">be putting off white light and that</text>
  <text start="3333.979" dur="5.64">light would be conducive for</text>
  <text start="3335.979" dur="4.301">photosynthesis now in trying to</text>
  <text start="3339.619" dur="4.171">determine how</text>
  <text start="3340.28" dur="5.19">large this thing is what we&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="3343.79" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re estimating based on the diameter</text>
  <text start="3345.47" dur="6.03">of the earth and their distance from the</text>
  <text start="3347.54" dur="6.72">Sun we kind of know what the mass of the</text>

  <text start="3378.35" dur="5.37">gravitational bodies we have a core and</text>
  <text start="3380.81" dur="7.05">we have a crust and in between there is</text>

  <text start="3390.29" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s darn close to it so you have a</text>
  <text start="3392.78" dur="4.8">crust which is sitting somewhere around</text>
  <text start="3394.52" dur="5.85">2 or 3 grams per cubic centimeter and we</text>

  <text start="3400.37" dur="7.35">per cubic centimeter and those sizes and</text>
  <text start="3404.18" dur="6.84">those weights they work out which means</text>
  <text start="3407.72" dur="5.52">we have a core that&amp;#39;s rotating at one</text>
  <text start="3411.02" dur="4.74">speed and we have a crust that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3413.24" dur="5.67">rotating at another speed a slower</text>
  <text start="3415.76" dur="5.69">around the outside that&amp;#39;s what makes our</text>

  <text start="3421.6" dur="5.23">experimental and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s right now</text>
  <text start="3424.07" dur="5.81">just a hypothesis but the evidence seems</text>
  <text start="3426.83" dur="5.22">to support it ok and in that scenario</text>
  <text start="3429.88" dur="6.1">you&amp;#39;re saying there&amp;#39;s this space how</text>
  <text start="3432.05" dur="9.12">much is that space the estimate is</text>
  <text start="3435.98" dur="7.23">somewhere between 700 and 900 miles Wow</text>
  <text start="3441.17" dur="4.86">all the way around the core so that</text>
  <text start="3443.21" dur="6.42">would be a lot of available would be and</text>
  <text start="3446.03" dur="6.42">if you can are workable atmosphere this</text>
  <text start="3449.63" dur="11.07">year is actually much lower than it has</text>
  <text start="3452.45" dur="10.5">been it&amp;#39;s only about you know maybe 17</text>
  <text start="3460.7" dur="4.29">miles that&amp;#39;s about it that&amp;#39;s all the</text>
  <text start="3462.95" dur="5.07">atmosphere we have will used to have</text>
  <text start="3464.99" dur="5.31">more but the Sun has been very quiet and</text>
  <text start="3468.02" dur="5.4">so it doesn&amp;#39;t launch a lot of particles</text>
  <text start="3470.3" dur="3.87">toward our planet hasn&amp;#39;t in years and so</text>
  <text start="3473.42" dur="4.14">the atmosphere</text>
  <text start="3474.17" dur="4.83">is getting thinner and I mean this has</text>
  <text start="3477.56" dur="3.66">some benefits we have a lot of</text>
  <text start="3479" dur="3.96">satellites that are lasting years longer</text>
  <text start="3481.22" dur="4.62">than they would have lasted before</text>
  <text start="3482.96" dur="5.06">because dragging against the atmosphere</text>
  <text start="3485.84" dur="4.35">and you know burning up and falling</text>
  <text start="3488.02" dur="4.42">burning up in the atmosphere so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3490.19" dur="6.3">up there and they&amp;#39;re still working</text>
  <text start="3492.44" dur="6.51">we hope that solar cycle 25 which should</text>
  <text start="3496.49" dur="4.44">start in about half a decade we hope</text>
  <text start="3498.95" dur="5.28">that there are a lot more a lot more</text>
  <text start="3500.93" dur="6.78">solar activity to that or kernel mass</text>
  <text start="3504.23" dur="5.73">ejections more sunspots more solar</text>
  <text start="3507.71" dur="4.77">flares so that we can build up our</text>
  <text start="3509.96" dur="5.46">atmosphere again right now where the</text>
  <text start="3512.48" dur="4.83">atmosphere is getting thinner I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="3515.42" dur="3.96">this that we&amp;#39;re losing our atmosphere we</text>
  <text start="3517.31" dur="3.63">could end up like Mars or something is</text>
  <text start="3519.38" dur="4.08">what I&amp;#39;ve heard if it keeps continuing</text>
  <text start="3520.94" dur="6.6">and we have you know just no life on the</text>
  <text start="3523.46" dur="6.36">on the on the crust I guess but because</text>
  <text start="3527.54" dur="4.89">we are making gases we&amp;#39;re making oxygen</text>
  <text start="3529.82" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re making carbon dioxide we&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="3532.43" dur="4.86">enough to keep our atmosphere at least</text>
  <text start="3534.41" dur="5.58">at a minimal point but our atmosphere is</text>
  <text start="3537.29" dur="4.89">built up to to higher into the</text>
  <text start="3539.99" dur="4.59">troposphere upper troposphere by the Sun</text>
  <text start="3542.18" dur="5.13">we use those particles off the Sun to</text>
  <text start="3544.58" dur="4.98">build that out and then people often</text>
  <text start="3547.31" dur="5.52">will say that you know two decades ago</text>
  <text start="3549.56" dur="5.49">this guy was bluer and now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3552.83" dur="4.02">quite as as brilliantly blue as it used</text>
  <text start="3555.05" dur="3.3">to be and younger people may not notice</text>
  <text start="3556.85" dur="3.18">that and then older people say yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3558.35" dur="8.07">really clear what do you think about</text>
  <text start="3560.03" dur="10.56">that yeah yeah I&amp;#39;m from North Carolina</text>
  <text start="3566.42" dur="7.08">yeah so real fast to touch back on that</text>
  <text start="3570.59" dur="4.71">huge area you said the core would be</text>
  <text start="3573.5" dur="3.36">emitting a light and that would be</text>
  <text start="3575.3" dur="7.11">enough for photosynthesis in this</text>
  <text start="3576.86" dur="7.62">massive cavernous region so in theory</text>
  <text start="3582.41" dur="3.72">there could be just massive quantities</text>
  <text start="3584.48" dur="5.22">of life down there maybe not necessarily</text>
  <text start="3586.13" dur="5.13">intelligent but well in in in a</text>
  <text start="3589.7" dur="3.93">hypothesis there would be if you have</text>
  <text start="3591.26" dur="5.97">light you have air and you have the</text>
  <text start="3593.63" dur="6.09">necessary gases carbon dioxide mainly to</text>
  <text start="3597.23" dur="4.76">make the cellulose and sugars that that</text>
  <text start="3599.72" dur="4.74">plants make then yes you would have</text>
  <text start="3601.99" dur="4.39">plants and you wouldn&amp;#39;t really have any</text>
  <text start="3604.46" dur="3.27">weather to speak of because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3606.38" dur="4.95">Sun down</text>
  <text start="3607.73" dur="5.61">there&amp;#39;s no wind there&amp;#39;s no variation in</text>
  <text start="3611.33" dur="7.05">the internal conditions of the planet</text>
  <text start="3613.34" dur="6.6">now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very understandable then</text>
  <text start="3618.38" dur="5.31">in a few generations</text>
  <text start="3619.94" dur="5.64">whatever living things exist down there</text>
  <text start="3623.69" dur="4.1">they will not be able to withstand</text>
  <text start="3625.58" dur="5.039">living on the surface anymore</text>
  <text start="3627.79" dur="6.13">because down there you&amp;#39;re protected from</text>
  <text start="3630.619" dur="8.49">all of the solar radiation your genetics</text>
  <text start="3633.92" dur="8.189">would not suffer dimerization</text>
  <text start="3639.109" dur="6.361">dimerization is is what happens to</text>
  <text start="3642.109" dur="7.711">double bonds in inorganic chemistry when</text>
  <text start="3645.47" dur="6.389">a ultraviolet photon strikes that double</text>
  <text start="3649.82" dur="6.59">bond it will cleave it in two and create</text>
  <text start="3651.859" dur="7.081">a free radical which we call aging</text>
  <text start="3656.41" dur="6.01">likely that would not occur on the</text>
  <text start="3658.94" dur="5.07">inside of the planet okay now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3662.42" dur="3.24">starting to think of like Shambhala and</text>
  <text start="3664.01" dur="5.43">and all of these other like you know</text>
  <text start="3665.66" dur="5.459">mythologies and such okay so that is</text>
  <text start="3669.44" dur="4.919">very fascinating so we still have this</text>
  <text start="3671.119" dur="4.951">you know unexplored area you know the</text>
  <text start="3674.359" dur="3.181">great unknown does not necessarily have</text>
  <text start="3676.07" dur="4.59">to mean just space yet there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="3677.54" dur="5.819">places on earth to explore and you know</text>
  <text start="3680.66" dur="4.1">what how&amp;#39;s the technology are we gonna</text>
  <text start="3683.359" dur="5.76">be able to go down there anytime soon</text>
  <text start="3684.76" dur="6.43">well that&amp;#39;s a good question I I think we</text>
  <text start="3689.119" dur="3.99">need to start exploring our oceans more</text>
  <text start="3691.19" dur="5.25">aggressively there are not very many</text>
  <text start="3693.109" dur="6.75">ships that do this I&amp;#39;d say less than 10</text>
  <text start="3696.44" dur="4.98">on the whole planet and there are a</text>
  <text start="3699.859" dur="5.121">couple ways of doing this one of course</text>
  <text start="3701.42" dur="6.63">is to send you know craft down there and</text>
  <text start="3704.98" dur="6.76">survey but you could only do a few acres</text>
  <text start="3708.05" dur="6.42">at a time and then unless it&amp;#39;s a throne</text>
  <text start="3711.74" dur="5.49">of some kind unmanned but if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3714.47" dur="5.07">unmanned you have a a problem and that</text>
  <text start="3717.23" dur="5.61">is that you have to have a cable between</text>
  <text start="3719.54" dur="4.8">the surface ship and drone on the bottom</text>
  <text start="3722.84" dur="3.36">otherwise you can&amp;#39;t communicate to the</text>
  <text start="3724.34" dur="6">surface you don&amp;#39;t see anything until it</text>
  <text start="3726.2" dur="7.26">comes back and that&amp;#39;s very slow going</text>
  <text start="3730.34" dur="5.22">because the surface ship if it makes any</text>
  <text start="3733.46" dur="5.43">headway at all it&amp;#39;s gonna drag that</text>
  <text start="3735.56" dur="4.86">cable and pull your drone back up off</text>
  <text start="3738.89" dur="2.82">the bottom so you could see it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="3740.42" dur="5.939">very slow</text>
  <text start="3741.71" dur="8.31">going the other way to do it is to use</text>
  <text start="3746.359" dur="7.711">what&amp;#39;s called side scan sonar side scan</text>
  <text start="3750.02" dur="7.11">sonar is basically sonar that&amp;#39;s placed a</text>
  <text start="3754.07" dur="7.19">few hundred feet off the bottom and it</text>
  <text start="3757.13" dur="6.42">takes a sound picture of the bottom and</text>
  <text start="3761.26" dur="3.67">ships are doing this right now but</text>
  <text start="3763.55" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re only doing it in a few hundred</text>
  <text start="3764.93" dur="5.31">feet of water because these ships can</text>
  <text start="3767.69" dur="4.679">only carry a few hundred or maybe a</text>
  <text start="3770.24" dur="5.69">couple thousand feet of cable that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="3772.369" dur="8.011">to get to forty four hundred meters</text>
  <text start="3775.93" dur="7.06">you&amp;#39;re talking 12,000 feet of cable that</text>
  <text start="3780.38" dur="4.35">you have to carry on the boat and then</text>
  <text start="3782.99" dur="3.84">that has to be lowered that&amp;#39;s why I took</text>
  <text start="3784.73" dur="6.75">so long to find that Titanic because</text>
  <text start="3786.83" dur="7.38">these these basically remote control</text>
  <text start="3791.48" dur="5.4">drones that are fly-by-wire the wire has</text>
  <text start="3794.21" dur="5.76">to go down into the water and it takes a</text>
  <text start="3796.88" dur="7.25">long time to get any kind of view of</text>
  <text start="3799.97" dur="7.92">what&amp;#39;s going on I have friends that made</text>
  <text start="3804.13" dur="6.55">polar cruises in submarines but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3807.89" dur="5.58">no windows on the sub and and they have</text>
  <text start="3810.68" dur="6.6">a route that they travel they cannot go</text>
  <text start="3813.47" dur="7.26">4400 meters deep in a sub that&amp;#39;s not not</text>
  <text start="3817.28" dur="5.28">even on the charts maybe nine hundred to</text>
  <text start="3820.73" dur="4.8">a thousand feet that&amp;#39;s about as deep as</text>
  <text start="3822.56" dur="4.89">a modern submarine can go that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3825.53" dur="5.7">even close to getting an image of what</text>
  <text start="3827.45" dur="6.32">it&amp;#39;s like on the surface of the world</text>
  <text start="3831.23" dur="6.35">underneath the ocean so we have no idea</text>
  <text start="3833.77" dur="7.329">what our oceans hold there could be</text>
  <text start="3837.58" dur="7.57">entire civilizations living on the</text>
  <text start="3841.099" dur="7.291">seafloor in in structures that we have</text>
  <text start="3845.15" dur="6.03">no idea exists millions perhaps billions</text>
  <text start="3848.39" dur="5.459">of people could live under the ocean and</text>
  <text start="3851.18" dur="5.939">we would know anything about it okay so</text>
  <text start="3853.849" dur="5.01">if we&amp;#39;re gonna go find Atlantis then how</text>
  <text start="3857.119" dur="4.621">do we do this these ships can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3858.859" dur="4.351">withstand the pressure right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3861.74" dur="6.69">correct so the way that we&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="3863.21" dur="7.889">it is with satellites from space we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3868.43" dur="7.11">using other things besides visible light</text>
  <text start="3871.099" dur="7.321">we&amp;#39;re using infrared we&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="3875.54" dur="6.96">I like to call it tomography but let me</text>
  <text start="3878.42" dur="7.26">explain what that is we have sources on</text>
  <text start="3882.5" dur="6.84">the earth like HAARP that generate long</text>
  <text start="3885.68" dur="7.29">wave radio waves at very high amplitude</text>
  <text start="3889.34" dur="6.06">like a billion watts we bounce it off</text>
  <text start="3892.97" dur="5.19">the ionosphere and back down onto earth</text>
  <text start="3895.4" dur="6.09">which gives us a huge parallax on the</text>
  <text start="3898.16" dur="5.79">planet satellite then analyze those</text>
  <text start="3901.49" dur="5.64">waves as they bounce off various strata</text>
  <text start="3903.95" dur="4.98">in the ground and come up and of course</text>
  <text start="3907.13" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;ve done really good at finding oil</text>
  <text start="3908.93" dur="4.92">reservoirs I mean huge oil reservoirs we</text>
  <text start="3911.84" dur="4.13">never knew existed before that</text>
  <text start="3913.85" dur="6.39">technologies worked really well for that</text>
  <text start="3915.97" dur="7.39">but those those antenna facilities are</text>
  <text start="3920.24" dur="4.71">stationary there&amp;#39;s about two dozen of</text>
  <text start="3923.36" dur="3.72">them operating on the planet right now</text>
  <text start="3924.95" dur="5.16">fortunately they don&amp;#39;t all operate at</text>
  <text start="3927.08" dur="7.14">one time but they&amp;#39;re built in areas</text>
  <text start="3930.11" dur="7.26">where specifically hydrocarbons are</text>
  <text start="3934.22" dur="6.3">expected to be very rich and we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="3937.37" dur="6.75">drilling those because it&amp;#39;s low-hanging</text>
  <text start="3940.52" dur="7.11">fruit there are other aspects of this so</text>
  <text start="3944.12" dur="6">we can do tamo graphical mapping which</text>
  <text start="3947.63" dur="5.16">means we can map not only the near</text>
  <text start="3950.12" dur="5.24">surface but we can get deeper into the</text>
  <text start="3952.79" dur="6">planet and see things that are going on</text>
  <text start="3955.36" dur="7">upwards of you know ten fifteen thousand</text>
  <text start="3958.79" dur="5.49">feet under the surface and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="3962.36" dur="5.04">we&amp;#39;ve been that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;ve been mapping</text>
  <text start="3964.28" dur="5.82">it these these things can&amp;#39;t really be</text>
  <text start="3967.4" dur="5.07">seen visually you can only see so far</text>
  <text start="3970.1" dur="7.47">into the water visible light only goes</text>
  <text start="3972.47" dur="6.99">down a few hundred feet and then okay so</text>
  <text start="3977.57" dur="3.75">I don&amp;#39;t even know the answer to this but</text>
  <text start="3979.46" dur="5.43">how deep does the ocean like in the</text>
  <text start="3981.32" dur="5.58">deeper places get to we we there are</text>
  <text start="3984.89" dur="4.59">places in the trench somewhere around</text>
  <text start="3986.9" dur="7.05">twenty one to twenty three thousand feet</text>
  <text start="3989.48" dur="7.98">deep okay that&amp;#39;s amazing this is where</text>
  <text start="3993.95" dur="6.56">evidently there&amp;#39;s an enormous crack in</text>
  <text start="3997.46" dur="8.22">the earth it&amp;#39;s off the east coast of</text>
  <text start="4000.51" dur="8.74">America and the minute our trench Cuba</text>
  <text start="4005.68" dur="7.38">is down there it has about 60</text>
  <text start="4009.25" dur="4.98">500 foot deep water around Cuba and in</text>
  <text start="4013.06" dur="4.92">the Gulf of Mexico</text>
  <text start="4014.23" dur="6.69">it&amp;#39;s a enormous crater kind of structure</text>
  <text start="4017.98" dur="5.22">but it&amp;#39;s very very deep and then you get</text>
  <text start="4020.92" dur="4.65">up to the North Sea in that area the sea</text>
  <text start="4023.2" dur="4.44">is about twelve thousand feet deep there</text>
  <text start="4025.57" dur="4.17">are areas where there are shelves close</text>
  <text start="4027.64" dur="10.98">to where the continents are but out in</text>
  <text start="4029.74" dur="10.98">the middle it&amp;#39;s Wow okay so my mind is a</text>
  <text start="4038.62" dur="4.23">bit blown with the possibilities you</text>
  <text start="4040.72" dur="4.98">know you want forgive me but what what</text>
  <text start="4042.85" dur="4.29">else well what else is there that you</text>
  <text start="4045.7" dur="3.63">know we&amp;#39;re on the we&amp;#39;re on the forefront</text>
  <text start="4047.14" dur="4.59">of a lot of issues here you know past</text>
  <text start="4049.33" dur="4.59">and future well I mean one of the</text>
  <text start="4051.73" dur="6.44">phenomenon that&amp;#39;s kind of going on out</text>
  <text start="4053.92" dur="7.41">there is this this disclosure movement</text>
  <text start="4058.17" dur="7.06">we&amp;#39;re pretty sure the governments have</text>
  <text start="4061.33" dur="6.03">records and knowledge of technology that</text>
  <text start="4065.23" dur="6.03">they don&amp;#39;t share with the rest of the</text>
  <text start="4067.36" dur="10.07">world we we can speculate that the</text>
  <text start="4071.26" dur="6.17">reason that is basically to one is that</text>
  <text start="4077.7" dur="4.9">governments like to control energy</text>
  <text start="4079.89" dur="5.56">because energy is a massive source of</text>
  <text start="4082.6" dur="4.62">income so they lay wires along the</text>
  <text start="4085.45" dur="3.99">ground and they tell us we have to live</text>
  <text start="4087.22" dur="4.04">along those wires and then they meter</text>
  <text start="4089.44" dur="4.83">all that energy and this is how they</text>
  <text start="4091.26" dur="6.07">control the way we sprawl across the</text>
  <text start="4094.27" dur="4.88">planet that&amp;#39;s one the other is that a</text>
  <text start="4097.33" dur="4.949">lot of this energy can be used for</text>
  <text start="4099.15" dur="5.77">weaponry and we don&amp;#39;t really want that</text>
  <text start="4102.279" dur="5.371">weaponry to fall into the hands of those</text>
  <text start="4104.92" dur="3.839">who wish harm to the human race and they</text>
  <text start="4107.65" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t really care what happens to</text>
  <text start="4108.759" dur="4.821">themselves and some of this weaponry is</text>
  <text start="4111.43" dur="6.15">pretty devastating antimatter weapons</text>
  <text start="4113.58" dur="6.67">particle beam weapons sonic weapons</text>
  <text start="4117.58" dur="7.14">which can scramble the brains can undo</text>
  <text start="4120.25" dur="5.73">DNA oh just terrible terrible weapons we</text>
  <text start="4124.72" dur="3.619">don&amp;#39;t want those to phone in the wrong</text>
  <text start="4125.98" dur="4.98">hands so they suppress that technology</text>
  <text start="4128.339" dur="5.561">but I think maybe there&amp;#39;s another reason</text>
  <text start="4130.96" dur="4.95">I don&amp;#39;t think it has anything to do with</text>
  <text start="4133.9" dur="3.39">oh the religions of mankind would</text>
  <text start="4135.91" dur="3.69">collapse if we found out there was</text>
  <text start="4137.29" dur="4.08">another intelligent race not human</text>
  <text start="4139.6" dur="3.48">living on this planet I&amp;#39;m not afraid of</text>
  <text start="4141.37" dur="3.06">that I don&amp;#39;t think you are either</text>
  <text start="4143.08" dur="6.42">don&amp;#39;t think anybody listening to your</text>
  <text start="4144.43" dur="7.71">program is afraid of that but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4149.5" dur="5.7">something about realizing that you&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="4152.14" dur="8.61">longer the smartest kid in the room mmm</text>
  <text start="4155.2" dur="8.49">some other race may have survived many</text>
  <text start="4160.75" dur="4.589">zenith of humans on this planet and</text>
  <text start="4163.69" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s evidence that there have been at</text>
  <text start="4165.339" dur="7.111">least five major Zenith of mankind going</text>
  <text start="4169.33" dur="7.88">back five six million years on this</text>
  <text start="4172.45" dur="8.63">planet way beyond known history but we</text>
  <text start="4177.21" dur="6.58">see their stuff locked in mines and</text>
  <text start="4181.08" dur="6.34">sedimentary layers we know how old those</text>
  <text start="4183.79" dur="5.85">layers are and there&amp;#39;s no reason why a</text>
  <text start="4187.42" dur="5.7">human footprint should be there or a</text>
  <text start="4189.64" dur="6.72">hammer or a piece of jewelry it should</text>
  <text start="4193.12" dur="6">not be there but it is so we know that</text>
  <text start="4196.36" dur="5.37">these demons have existed we know that</text>
  <text start="4199.12" dur="6.42">there are let&amp;#39;s call them at least ultra</text>
  <text start="4201.73" dur="8.88">terrestrials other races on this planet</text>
  <text start="4205.54" dur="7.32">which choose not to basically land on</text>
  <text start="4210.61" dur="5.94">the White House lawn and say here we are</text>
  <text start="4212.86" dur="6.05">we come in peace they and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="4216.55" dur="6.3">about unidentified flying objects</text>
  <text start="4218.91" dur="7.98">unidentified C objects there is present</text>
  <text start="4222.85" dur="9.51">as they want to be that I know for sure</text>
  <text start="4226.89" dur="7.78">okay I&amp;#39;ve heard talk of you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4232.36" dur="5.85">heard talk of giants and I&amp;#39;ve heard talk</text>
  <text start="4234.67" dur="5.13">of something called the the nemu or</text>
  <text start="4238.21" dur="3.48">something like that like ocean creatures</text>
  <text start="4239.8" dur="4.11">at cliff highs talked about that and I</text>
  <text start="4241.69" dur="4.71">really don&amp;#39;t know much about it do you</text>
  <text start="4243.91" dur="6.56">do you have names for these or there is</text>
  <text start="4246.4" dur="9.21">there any sort of strong you know</text>
  <text start="4250.47" dur="8.62">characteristics maybe of them well I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="4255.61" dur="7.56">be lying if I said no I I&amp;#39;ve never met</text>
  <text start="4259.09" dur="6.39">any but I know that there are seven</text>
  <text start="4263.17" dur="6.14">billion of us alive plus on the earth</text>
  <text start="4265.48" dur="7.71">right now I know the souls and that</text>
  <text start="4269.31" dur="6.19">occupy these biological transducers that</text>
  <text start="4273.19" dur="3.1">were walking around and come from</text>
  <text start="4275.5" dur="6.76">somewhere</text>
  <text start="4276.29" dur="8.19">and I know I know that some of those</text>
  <text start="4282.26" dur="3.81">souls aren&amp;#39;t from here some of those</text>
  <text start="4284.48" dur="6.81">souls are from other worlds that have</text>
  <text start="4286.07" dur="6.87">passed away and they came here this as I</text>
  <text start="4291.29" dur="3.18">said at the beginning of the program is</text>
  <text start="4292.94" dur="4.35">the greatest show in the universe the</text>
  <text start="4294.47" dur="8.04">greatest Souls in the universe come here</text>
  <text start="4297.29" dur="7.89">for a mortal life and I think that many</text>
  <text start="4302.51" dur="6.84">of those souls are remembering things</text>
  <text start="4305.18" dur="8.07">that that were washed away or wiped away</text>
  <text start="4309.35" dur="6.99">in the birth process but somewhere in</text>
  <text start="4313.25" dur="6.69">early adolescence or post adolescence</text>
  <text start="4316.34" dur="7.41">this memory begins to wake up the soul</text>
  <text start="4319.94" dur="6.45">begins to remember who they are what</text>
  <text start="4323.75" dur="5.67">they did how they bring skills forward</text>
  <text start="4326.39" dur="5.88">with them to this world and I think what</text>
  <text start="4329.42" dur="8.45">we&amp;#39;ve seen in the last I&amp;#39;m gonna say you</text>
  <text start="4332.27" dur="8.58">know 35 years is an absolute supernova</text>
  <text start="4337.87" dur="4.9">explosion of knowledge on this planet</text>
  <text start="4340.85" dur="4.41">that didn&amp;#39;t come because we had really</text>
  <text start="4342.77" dur="5.13">good textbooks or that certainly didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4345.26" dur="5.79">because it come that way because we have</text>
  <text start="4347.9" dur="5.58">smart professors we don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="4351.05" dur="5.76">of these souls that are coming to the</text>
  <text start="4353.48" dur="7.37">planet mathematicians metallurgist you</text>
  <text start="4356.81" dur="7.08">know I heard that India has more</text>
  <text start="4360.85" dur="6.7">straighten things than we have students</text>
  <text start="4363.89" dur="7.14">in this country these souls are pouring</text>
  <text start="4367.55" dur="5.61">into our planet and they&amp;#39;re young 9 10</text>
  <text start="4371.03" dur="4.71">12 years old and they understand things</text>
  <text start="4373.16" dur="4.38">that you know my teachers didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4375.74" dur="4.25">understand</text>
  <text start="4377.54" dur="5.61">I know people listening to this program</text>
  <text start="4379.99" dur="6.49">you know who you are and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4383.15" dur="7.53">know who you are I think you suspect but</text>
  <text start="4386.48" dur="6.27">that something I&amp;#39;d know what to call</text>
  <text start="4390.68" dur="5.52">those those races we&amp;#39;re human now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4392.75" dur="6.66">in we&amp;#39;re in in human bodies and our</text>
  <text start="4396.2" dur="7.62">souls came the right way to this planet</text>

  <text start="4403.82" dur="5.82">couldn&amp;#39;t harm another soul no matter</text>
  <text start="4406.19" dur="5.06">what it&amp;#39;s not in us it&amp;#39;s not our way</text>
  <text start="4409.64" dur="5.16">there are others here on this planet</text>
  <text start="4411.25" dur="7.42">that is all they know is violence and</text>
  <text start="4414.8" dur="7.74">they enjoy the violence they enjoy</text>
  <text start="4418.67" dur="10.01">inflicting pain on others others like us</text>
  <text start="4422.54" dur="6.14">we don&amp;#39;t have that propensity in us at</text>
  <text start="4429.07" dur="5.05">some future Tesla&amp;#39;s out there yeah and I</text>
  <text start="4432.56" dur="4.14">think the world is getting ready for a</text>
  <text start="4434.12" dur="6.12">metamorphosis the actual planet itself</text>
  <text start="4436.7" dur="6.66">is a symbiote symbiotic with the human</text>
  <text start="4440.24" dur="5.79">being itself and we&amp;#39;re getting ready for</text>
  <text start="4443.36" dur="5.07">a symbiosis there&amp;#39;s so much human</text>
  <text start="4446.03" dur="4.86">consciousness alive on this planet right</text>
  <text start="4448.43" dur="5.58">now that it is beginning to resonate</text>
  <text start="4450.89" dur="5.07">with the living being earth itself and</text>
  <text start="4454.01" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re getting ready to go through a</text>
  <text start="4455.96" dur="6.63">change everybody feels it mm-hmm yeah</text>
  <text start="4460.37" dur="3.99">well some of us call it the great</text>
  <text start="4462.59" dur="3.27">awakening you know which has some</text>
  <text start="4464.36" dur="4.14">political connotations but it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="4465.86" dur="5.4">than that I think there there does seem</text>
  <text start="4468.5" dur="4.68">to be I tell people it&amp;#39;s the most</text>
  <text start="4471.26" dur="7.26">exciting time to be alive in the history</text>
  <text start="4473.18" dur="8.28">of all time yeah so every race every</text>
