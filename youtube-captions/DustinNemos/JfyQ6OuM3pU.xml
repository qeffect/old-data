  <text start="46.32" dur="5.07">of mine that we&amp;#39;ve met a few times now</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="6.42">and we spoke at the Q rally together in</text>
  <text start="51.39" dur="5.91">DC and and you know you have a fun story</text>
  <text start="54.36" dur="4.799">about that and we had a short chat</text>
  <text start="57.3" dur="3.95">before that and everything it was really</text>
  <text start="59.159" dur="4.621">good to meet you and your family and</text>
  <text start="61.25" dur="5.02">anyway I&amp;#39;m gonna let you kind of carried</text>

  <text start="68.19" dur="3.63">you came to the Q rally if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="69.87" dur="4.23">mind I&amp;#39;d like to give people that</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="4.799">background a little bit well here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="4.05">thing first of all it was so great to</text>
  <text start="76.619" dur="3.271">meet you to finally meet you because</text>
  <text start="78.15" dur="4.05">been watching you for a long time and I</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="4.53">was like oh I get it&amp;#39;s actually meet you</text>

  <text start="84.42" dur="4.29">chance to hang out so so wonderful that</text>
  <text start="86.79" dur="4.53">you got a chance to even come to my home</text>
  <text start="88.71" dur="5.82">so we had a great time about that but</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="6.299">this stuff really goes to the heart of</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="5.67">what I&amp;#39;m talking to people about today</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="4.651">the problem today is the mainstream</text>
  <text start="100.2" dur="5.25">media and that has been the problem all</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="5.279">along for me personally like I was</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="5.04">Trump&amp;#39;s personal photographer for two</text>
  <text start="107.549" dur="6.39">years during the 2016 campaign and I</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="5.61">constantly seen how the media has trying</text>
  <text start="113.939" dur="4.89">to get this other viewpoint of Trump and</text>
  <text start="116.1" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m out there telling people what Trump</text>
  <text start="118.829" dur="4.411">is really like they constantly say he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="4.68">a racist he&amp;#39;s a racist and it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="4.47">like that but it&amp;#39;s the same thing with</text>
  <text start="125.31" dur="2.759">the Q followers regardless of what you</text>
  <text start="127.71" dur="2.159">believe</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="4.531">really regardless of what anyone</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="5.611">believes here&amp;#39;s the thing the media is</text>
  <text start="132.6" dur="5.1">trying to dictate to you to people out</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="5.37">there who hate to think and what to</text>
  <text start="137.7" dur="5.01">think and so forth when the truth is you</text>
  <text start="140.85" dur="3.9">just got to do the research yourself and</text>
  <text start="142.71" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s the main part about it decide for</text>
  <text start="144.75" dur="4.41">yourself I agree yeah it&amp;#39;s the Socratic</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="3.84">method it&amp;#39;s the question and answer and</text>
  <text start="149.16" dur="3.21">you sort of you breadcrumb yourself</text>
  <text start="150.9" dur="3.419">eventually and you you bake your own</text>
  <text start="152.37" dur="3.479">bread in the sense where you find the</text>
  <text start="154.319" dur="3.961">answer and then that&amp;#39;s how people really</text>
  <text start="155.849" dur="3.151">get to know things anyway and it it does</text>
  <text start="158.28" dur="3.63">seem to be a move</text>
  <text start="159" dur="4.77">about in my opinion here training an</text>
  <text start="161.91" dur="3.6">army of citizen journalists that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.77" dur="4.8">always been in my position on this I</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="4.74">think you wanted to play the game and I</text>
  <text start="168.57" dur="3.75">you know what doesn&amp;#39;t the thing is I</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="4.89">totally agree with that to agree with</text>
  <text start="172.32" dur="5.16">everything that said probably not but</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="4.86">here&amp;#39;s the thing each person decides for</text>
  <text start="177.48" dur="4.74">themselves the problem with it the</text>
  <text start="180" dur="5.19">problem with the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="182.22" dur="4.8">the most vocal ones out there is they</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="3.3">are trying to tell you how to believe</text>
  <text start="187.02" dur="3.09">and one of the things that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="188.49" dur="4.59">and they&amp;#39;re doing this to a lot of</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="5.34">people those jewels are trying to take</text>
  <text start="193.08" dur="4.86">people like me and like you and turns</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="4.98">out to some tinfoil how crazy person</text>
  <text start="197.94" dur="5.07">were the crazy people but that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="5.88">furthest from the truth the truth is the</text>
  <text start="203.01" dur="4.56">mainstream media you guys are the losers</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="3.87">you guys are the losers</text>
  <text start="207.57" dur="5.37">we are the ones here me and Dustin other</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="4.8">ones online that a vocal we&amp;#39;re not the</text>
  <text start="212.94" dur="4.049">losers you are the losers we&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="4.74">with that pretty phrase and the pretty</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="5.431">wives we have the knife businesses with</text>
  <text start="219.72" dur="4.26">the nice great cars but you guys are the</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="4.71">losers and that&amp;#39;s what they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="223.98" dur="4.8">understand about it we will study on our</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="3.24">own we will make decisions on their own</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="3.72">and that&amp;#39;s what we will believe but</text>
  <text start="230.37" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t you dare tell us what to</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="4.44">believe don&amp;#39;t you minimize what we</text>
  <text start="234.6" dur="4.5">believe by saying somehow worked in hats</text>
  <text start="236.94" dur="3.96">like we&amp;#39;re spooky people you&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="5.28">losers promise you you guys are the</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="5.07">losers yeah and you know we know that</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="3.96">they cast everything through a negative</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="4.32">shade it&amp;#39;s sort of like an energetics</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="3.899">manipulation thing and you know you see</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="4.35">this from kids on the playground to it</text>
  <text start="252.239" dur="4.651">like trying to cause drama in some cases</text>
  <text start="254.64" dur="4.2">and you know maybe they hate someone and</text>
  <text start="256.89" dur="3.24">they spread false rumors you&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="258.84" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost as though we never</text>
  <text start="260.13" dur="3.99">outgrow high school in a sense but we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="3.659">come up against that and sort of a hard</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="3.33">stop in politics lately you know</text>
  <text start="265.979" dur="4.141">everyone sees it now everyone knows what</text>
  <text start="267.45" dur="5.61">fake news is about so you know when we</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="5.25">spoke at the Q rally in DC on 9/11 right</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="4.71">down you know in sight of the big house</text>
  <text start="275.37" dur="4.43">itself you know we were zooms very</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="5.28">exciting was very hot day it was break</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="5.14">initiate anywhere and there&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="283.05" dur="5.28">bands behind us that will get into that</text>
  <text start="284.94" dur="5.34">too but for me it was it was less Q</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="4.079">focused than it was this movement this</text>
  <text start="290.28" dur="4.889">this this great awakening that</text>
  <text start="292.409" dur="4.29">happened and even just kind of to point</text>
  <text start="295.169" dur="2.85">out the some of the censorship that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.699" dur="3.601">happening online and then you know I</text>
  <text start="298.019" dur="3.57">wanted to bring focus to that because we</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="3.599">lose that fight we lose every other</text>
  <text start="301.589" dur="3.241">fight including twenty20 they can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="303.899" dur="2.461">allowed to control the information</text>
  <text start="304.83" dur="3.899">obviously they can&amp;#39;t be trusted with</text>
  <text start="306.36" dur="4.139">that right and you know what</text>
  <text start="308.729" dur="3.99">like I said regardless of what anyone</text>
  <text start="310.499" dur="4.26">believes even if you&amp;#39;re on the laughter</text>
  <text start="312.719" dur="4.74">whatever you believe the thing with</text>
  <text start="314.759" dur="5.97">censorship they are taking your ability</text>
  <text start="317.459" dur="4.651">to decide for yourself I quite frankly I</text>
  <text start="320.729" dur="4.8">do my own research I know what I believe</text>
  <text start="322.11" dur="5.19">I I have convinced myself with certain</text>
  <text start="325.529" dur="3.45">things other things I said you know what</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="3.949">I don&amp;#39;t really know too much about that</text>
  <text start="328.979" dur="4.92">I&amp;#39;ll look into it later on but by doing</text>
  <text start="331.249" dur="4.42">censorship and just blocking this you</text>
  <text start="333.899" dur="5.43">are preventing even the people on the</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="5.34">left they think that you the people on</text>
  <text start="339.329" dur="3.84">the left are stupid because they have to</text>
  <text start="341.009" dur="3.87">control everything they have to be the</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="4.05">ones to tell you what to believe and</text>
  <text start="344.879" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s shameful really to be honest if I</text>
  <text start="347.219" dur="3.36">say something but doesn&amp;#39;t says something</text>
  <text start="348.839" dur="3.03">or anyone else says something all right</text>
  <text start="350.579" dur="3.471">believe it I don&amp;#39;t believe it</text>
  <text start="351.869" dur="4.71">but do your research do it on your own</text>
  <text start="354.05" dur="4.449">yeah and they certainly showed up to</text>
  <text start="356.579" dur="4.14">demonize us this time right like they</text>

  <text start="360.719" dur="6.12">outlets of the MSM Mother Jones Daily</text>
  <text start="363.869" dur="5.19">Beast Washington Post and I think there</text>

  <text start="376.339" dur="6.34">you know what we are the ones that have</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="4.71">done the logical thinking but I promise</text>
  <text start="382.679" dur="4.83">you don&amp;#39;t comment us really don&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="384.599" dur="5.46">at us like like we&amp;#39;re so when spooky are</text>

  <text start="391.349" dur="4.74">losers you know we are the ones</text>
  <text start="393.409" dur="5.11">functioning in society we are</text>
  <text start="396.089" dur="4.41">functioning in society just fine and as</text>
  <text start="398.519" dur="3.57">you guys are the ones scared because</text>
  <text start="400.499" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re not listening to you anymore we</text>
  <text start="402.089" dur="4.26">used to I could promise you that we used</text>
  <text start="404.939" dur="3.03">to take what the media gave us and</text>
  <text start="406.349" dur="2.13">whatever you say it&amp;#39;s like oh that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="407.969" dur="2.94">news</text>
  <text start="408.479" dur="5.46">nope not like that anymore not like that</text>
  <text start="410.909" dur="5.04">anymore yeah and in some stats to back</text>
  <text start="413.939" dur="4.111">that up they keep having mass layoffs of</text>
  <text start="415.949" dur="4.44">places like CNN you know and no one</text>
  <text start="418.05" dur="5.13">trusts them anymore so ratings are</text>
  <text start="420.389" dur="4.44">collapsing especially after the rush of</text>
  <text start="423.18" dur="2.11">collusion delusion fell apart the</text>
  <text start="424.829" dur="2.021">Mueller</text>
  <text start="425.29" dur="3.75">the whole blockade and everything I</text>
  <text start="426.85" dur="3.81">would say that that is directly</text>
  <text start="429.04" dur="4.29">responsible with the key movement we</text>
  <text start="430.66" dur="4.38">have helped President Trump crush the</text>
  <text start="433.33" dur="3.45">the mainstream media between a rock and</text>
  <text start="435.04" dur="4.02">a hard place so to speak politically</text>
  <text start="436.78" dur="3.66">speaking and I agree with that and I</text>
  <text start="439.06" dur="3.45">think that&amp;#39;s the whole point about that</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="4.59">and really go back to the the Trump</text>
  <text start="442.51" dur="4.68">factor here that is why that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="4.47">received so much pushback because I</text>
  <text start="447.19" dur="5.31">wrote a book and I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="5.04">Dustin if I wanted to if I wanted to</text>
  <text start="452.5" dur="4.5">make a lot a lot of money all I would</text>
  <text start="454.54" dur="7.23">have to do is write a book and just tell</text>
  <text start="457" dur="7.29">a few lies just a few lies and can put</text>
  <text start="461.77" dur="4.56">Trump into a negative light and if I did</text>
  <text start="464.29" dur="4.02">that they were giving million-dollar</text>
  <text start="466.33" dur="4.53">advances to people that were books about</text>
  <text start="468.31" dur="5.28">Trump and they knew in just a fraction</text>
  <text start="470.86" dur="4.71">of the time that I know them but I seen</text>
  <text start="473.59" dur="4.5">Trump for two years as a fly in the wall</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="4.29">I see how we interacts with other people</text>
  <text start="478.09" dur="3.96">and that&amp;#39;s what the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="479.86" dur="4.35">doesn&amp;#39;t want people to know they that is</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="3.9">why I like I am a threat to them you are</text>
  <text start="484.21" dur="4.23">a threat to them because we are actually</text>
  <text start="485.95" dur="5.1">saying truths and you can look it up for</text>
  <text start="488.44" dur="4.65">yourselves or as in the case of me that</text>
  <text start="491.05" dur="5.19">total eye witness to the character of</text>
  <text start="493.09" dur="5.43">Donald Trump and and you&amp;#39;re a must be</text>
  <text start="496.24" dur="4.44">cleared here or a minority correct so he</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="4.59">has never treated you badly or you know</text>
  <text start="500.68" dur="4.83">and this is why the Dustin this is what</text>
  <text start="503.11" dur="4.41">gets to the core of it right so like</text>
  <text start="505.51" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;ve interviewed with some mainstream</text>
  <text start="507.52" dur="3.81">media outlets that on the left because</text>
  <text start="509.41" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m not afraid and that&amp;#39;s the thing they</text>
  <text start="511.33" dur="3.93">know this that I&amp;#39;m not afraid so they</text>
  <text start="513.43" dur="3.239">they don&amp;#39;t ask me for interviews anymore</text>
  <text start="515.26" dur="3.69">but bring it all day long</text>
  <text start="516.669" dur="5.161">bring it all day long but this is what</text>
  <text start="518.95" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;ll say they&amp;#39;ll say hey gene um did</text>
  <text start="521.83" dur="5.46">you ever see anything that Trump it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.81" dur="5.04">you that is racist I say no no no</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="1.98">nothing at all I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything</text>
  <text start="528.85" dur="2.01">like it</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="3.89">but then you know what they say of</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="5.13">course they said ah but that&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="533.16" dur="5.26">you&amp;#39;re Asian and then when he&amp;#39;s in front</text>
  <text start="535.99" dur="4.02">of you he&amp;#39;s gonna act differently you</text>
  <text start="538.42" dur="3.51">know what so no matter what what I say</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="4.35">they always try to paint it into some</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="4.08">negative light if I say no I didn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="544.36" dur="4.32">anything they said oh well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.01" dur="4.71">because you&amp;#39;re dumb and then he was</text>

  <text start="660.37" dur="5.13">like give you a one star whatever well</text>
  <text start="662.35" dur="5.81">we had a company online that actually</text>

  <text start="668.16" dur="5.68">we&amp;#39;re like where do they all go and same</text>
  <text start="671.56" dur="5.13">thing who comes to our rescue the Trump</text>

  <text start="678.82" dur="4.59">suddenly disappear all his five-star</text>
  <text start="680.62" dur="5.97">reviews and then this company goes oh oh</text>
  <text start="683.41" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s just an accident or glitch there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.59" dur="3.84">a computer glitch you know what we are</text>
  <text start="688.96" dur="3.76">calling them left and right on</text>
  <text start="690.43" dur="3.55">everything they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="692.72" dur="3.659">because noticing and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="693.98" dur="5.039">difference yeah and it happened with</text>
  <text start="696.379" dur="3.841">ours just briefly with the qa9 book he</text>
  <text start="699.019" dur="3.211">went on an invitation to the Great</text>
  <text start="700.22" dur="4.109">Awakening which was a collaborative</text>
  <text start="702.23" dur="4.799">project to just he&amp;#39;ll sort of a red pail</text>
  <text start="704.329" dur="4.651">a red pill truther book at the time just</text>
  <text start="707.029" dur="4.41">to sort of get an art of war out there</text>
  <text start="708.98" dur="4.279">for folks so to teach them how to to</text>
  <text start="711.439" dur="4.621">breadcrumb others on these topics but</text>
  <text start="713.259" dur="4.661">Amazon taught took out like three or</text>
  <text start="716.06" dur="3.269">four hundred confirmed purchase reviews</text>
  <text start="717.92" dur="3">after they had already purchased the</text>
  <text start="719.329" dur="3.75">book and left a positive review and</text>
  <text start="720.92" dur="4.38">almost everything was five-star of</text>
  <text start="723.079" dur="3.901">course on glowing reviews and the ones</text>
  <text start="725.3" dur="4.05">that weren&amp;#39;t were not even confirmed</text>
  <text start="726.98" dur="4.44">purchase but you know it happened as we</text>
  <text start="729.35" dur="3.81">were sort of racing for the number one</text>
  <text start="731.42" dur="4.62">position and the bestseller list which</text>
  <text start="733.16" dur="4.77">is stable right and of course we had</text>
  <text start="736.04" dur="4.14">already beat the deep state make you</text>
  <text start="737.93" dur="4.98">know narrative from the McKay book and</text>
  <text start="740.18" dur="4.29">then we were kind of competing with the</text>
  <text start="742.91" dur="3.479">Michelle Obama book at the time and they</text>
  <text start="744.47" dur="3.809">just had it so they not just found we</text>
  <text start="746.389" dur="3.421">never hit number one we mean it&amp;#39;s number</text>
  <text start="748.279" dur="3.66">two which was something we can never</text>
  <text start="749.81" dur="6.029">take away you know they mess with you</text>
  <text start="751.939" dur="6.031">yeah yeah and the difference is is the</text>
  <text start="755.839" dur="3.781">more awake that America gets the more</text>
  <text start="757.97" dur="3.869">awake and the more that we learned that</text>
  <text start="759.62" dur="4.11">you everyone out there learns personally</text>
  <text start="761.839" dur="4.17">that is gonna make all the difference in</text>
  <text start="763.73" dur="4.14">the world and the the difference is now</text>
  <text start="766.009" dur="3.27">we are awake and then we&amp;#39;re standing</text>
  <text start="767.87" dur="3.81">together so that&amp;#39;s what we need to</text>
  <text start="769.279" dur="5.221">continue to do and continue stand firm</text>
  <text start="771.68" dur="4.589">in that yeah absolutely and you know</text>
  <text start="774.5" dur="3.449">what I want to take a moment to just</text>
  <text start="776.269" dur="3.69">briefly draw attention to the stock bit</text>
  <text start="777.949" dur="3.57">burning calm thing because you know</text>
  <text start="779.959" dur="3.451">we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re having a meeting very soon</text>
  <text start="781.519" dur="3.721">I&amp;#39;ve invited you know many of us to</text>
  <text start="783.41" dur="3.69">attend that I&amp;#39;m not going to give away</text>
  <text start="785.24" dur="3.389">the details or anything but you know a</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="4.679">lot of influential people are going to</text>
  <text start="788.629" dur="5.971">be there have sort of a Q&amp;amp;A discussion</text>
  <text start="791.779" dur="4.141">session with the attorney and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="794.6" dur="3.87">going to figure out what path we can</text>
  <text start="795.92" dur="4.109">take to stop censorship as a group as it</text>
  <text start="798.47" dur="4.409">is it where we go and go all kind of</text>
  <text start="800.029" dur="5.191">tactic exactly.you more it makes the</text>
  <text start="802.879" dur="5.221">dream work and you know what go along</text>
  <text start="805.22" dur="5.789">with that the problem in America with</text>
  <text start="808.1" dur="5.969">that is that for some reason the tactic</text>
  <text start="811.009" dur="5.911">of the left is to say we&amp;#39;re gonna brand</text>
  <text start="814.069" dur="5.46">Trump as a racist and then everyone</text>
  <text start="816.92" dur="5.279">that&amp;#39;s associated with him they must be</text>
  <text start="819.529" dur="5.541">also a racist but the point is number</text>
  <text start="822.199" dur="6.83">one Trump is not a racist but what</text>
  <text start="825.07" dur="6.06">is that they have wage war on us in that</text>
  <text start="829.029" dur="4.081">sense they try to paint everyone in the</text>
  <text start="831.13" dur="3.99">broad brush with that and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="833.11" dur="4.649">interesting because even since I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="835.12" dur="6.079">outspoken about Trump it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="837.759" dur="5.88">to see how people have not been</text>
  <text start="841.199" dur="4.69">appreciative of another viewpoint so</text>
  <text start="843.639" dur="4.44">they unfriend people that support Trump</text>
  <text start="845.889" dur="4.051">and then when they do that they isolate</text>
  <text start="848.079" dur="3.18">themselves and then they end up if they</text>
  <text start="849.94" dur="3.449">just get all their information through</text>
  <text start="851.259" dur="5.101">the mainstream media that&amp;#39;s all they see</text>
  <text start="853.389" dur="4.89">so my point is a lot of the people on</text>
  <text start="856.36" dur="3.75">the left not just because they are on</text>
  <text start="858.279" dur="3.271">the left not all of them really bad it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="860.11" dur="4.919">just that they&amp;#39;re getting all their news</text>
  <text start="861.55" dur="6.42">from the mainstream media and then they</text>
  <text start="865.029" dur="3.87">are preventing themselves from engaging</text>
  <text start="867.97" dur="3.239">with other people</text>
  <text start="868.899" dur="4.411">I like viewpoints of all sorts and then</text>
  <text start="871.209" dur="4.231">I&amp;#39;ll debate you and you might win or I</text>
  <text start="873.31" dur="4.68">might change my thoughts or I might</text>
  <text start="875.44" dur="5.699">change your thoughts but the thing is we</text>
  <text start="877.99" dur="5.13">have to have it open out there with no</text>
  <text start="881.139" dur="4.531">censorship so that we can have a good</text>
  <text start="883.12" dur="5.07">discussion and we can say oh wow you</text>
  <text start="885.67" dur="4.02">know what I was wrong about that and if</text>
  <text start="888.19" dur="3.18">it is then you just change her you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="889.69" dur="4.259">beautiful indoor things is that simple</text>
  <text start="891.37" dur="4.38">yeah and often our ego gets involved but</text>
  <text start="893.949" dur="3.211">you know the sign of a wise person is</text>
  <text start="895.75" dur="3.12">can you change your position if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="897.16" dur="3.479">confronted with things that disprove you</text>
  <text start="898.87" dur="3.6">and yeah will they double down and</text>
  <text start="900.639" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;ll ignore you and they&amp;#39;ll hate you</text>
  <text start="902.47" dur="3.21">and they&amp;#39;ll have cognitive dissonance</text>
  <text start="903.819" dur="4.051">and they&amp;#39;ll they&amp;#39;ll lash out at you and</text>
  <text start="905.68" dur="3.659">in historical cases myrin kill you if</text>
  <text start="907.87" dur="3.779">you point out that they&amp;#39;re wrong about</text>
  <text start="909.339" dur="5.19">things yeah you know I mean benzion a</text>
  <text start="911.649" dur="5.67">mob that happens yep and but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.529" dur="6.451">where I know you know the difference is</text>
  <text start="917.319" dur="5.52">is that I&amp;#39;ve done my research myself and</text>
  <text start="920.98" dur="3.539">it&amp;#39;s interesting because even my wife</text>
  <text start="922.839" dur="3.151">will do some and she&amp;#39;ll talk to some of</text>
  <text start="924.519" dur="3.781">our friends and then she&amp;#39;ll give them</text>
  <text start="925.99" dur="5.279">points but they don&amp;#39;t even look at those</text>
  <text start="928.3" dur="5.19">points I mean that is what is it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="931.269" dur="4.111">core of what we need to have is no</text>
  <text start="933.49" dur="4.079">censorship so people could speak their</text>
  <text start="935.38" dur="4.35">minds and if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s not correct</text>
  <text start="937.569" dur="4.44">then then show me how we&amp;#39;re not correct</text>
  <text start="939.73" dur="4.169">so that is that simple really you know</text>
  <text start="942.009" dur="3.901">you bring up your wife and I got a</text>
  <text start="943.899" dur="4.5">chance to meet her and your family and</text>
  <text start="945.91" dur="3.779">they&amp;#39;re amazing and my daughter Athena</text>
  <text start="948.399" dur="4.411">for those who are watching they really</text>
  <text start="949.689" dur="3.931">she approved likes them I just she is</text>
  <text start="952.81" dur="2.639">adorable</text>
  <text start="953.62" dur="4.92">seriously oh my god she is so adorable</text>
  <text start="955.449" dur="5.041">at your picture on the phone you know</text>
  <text start="958.54" dur="3.75">from that&amp;#39;s because when I met I was</text>
  <text start="960.49" dur="4.35">like waving at her initially I guess you</text>
  <text start="962.29" dur="5.13">remembered it 30 minutes later she</text>
  <text start="964.84" dur="5.1">starts waving you know just to find out</text>
  <text start="967.42" dur="3.93">if she trusts you first but you know we</text>
  <text start="969.94" dur="4.23">had a chance to hang out and that was</text>
  <text start="971.35" dur="4.62">really great and she had told a story</text>
  <text start="974.17" dur="3.69">and I don&amp;#39;t know if we can talk about it</text>
  <text start="975.97" dur="3.93">of these white bands that showed up to</text>
  <text start="977.86" dur="4.14">the pier rally I do you want to talk</text>
  <text start="979.9" dur="4.2">about that briefly yeah I mean the thing</text>
  <text start="982" dur="4.77">is we&amp;#39;re having this rally and then</text>
  <text start="984.1" dur="5.25">there&amp;#39;s this light that needed to be</text>
  <text start="986.77" dur="3.99">fixed I guess but like in the middle of</text>
  <text start="989.35" dur="3">rally I mean they had a product for this</text>
  <text start="990.76" dur="5.07">in the Washington Monument and then all</text>
  <text start="992.35" dur="6.12">of a sudden white van shows up and you</text>
  <text start="995.83" dur="5.01">know they start working on the working</text>
  <text start="998.47" dur="4.43">on it but it was interesting because the</text>
  <text start="1000.84" dur="4.44">very interesting thing about a1 workers</text>
  <text start="1002.9" dur="3.94">which we did our research and I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1005.28" dur="4.26">mention the company but the company</text>
  <text start="1006.84" dur="4.44">doesn&amp;#39;t even exist in that area so we</text>
  <text start="1009.54" dur="4.56">did the research but one of the guys</text>
  <text start="1011.28" dur="4.92">came out and we caught it on a video I</text>
  <text start="1014.1" dur="4.41">think it was maybe Jordan say first</text>
  <text start="1016.2" dur="4.08">video but we have a picture of a</text>
  <text start="1018.51" dur="4.08">construction worker or whatever he was</text>
  <text start="1020.28" dur="3.84">taking a picture of my wife so like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1022.59" dur="4.17">just interesting that you would have a</text>
  <text start="1024.12" dur="4.95">camera there but it&amp;#39;s stuff like that</text>
  <text start="1026.76" dur="4.89">but the other thing about it is you know</text>
  <text start="1029.07" dur="3.93">do what do whatever you guys want to do</text>
  <text start="1031.65" dur="3.059">because it&amp;#39;s not going to change the way</text>
  <text start="1033" dur="3.72">I feel about things certainly not gonna</text>
  <text start="1034.709" dur="4.321">feel change the way Dustin I&amp;#39;m sure you</text>
  <text start="1036.72" dur="3.66">feel you anything but it&amp;#39;s stuff like</text>
  <text start="1039.03" dur="3.12">that is happening I don&amp;#39;t intimidate</text>
  <text start="1040.38" dur="3.81">easily I&amp;#39;m sure you don&amp;#39;t either</text>
  <text start="1042.15" dur="4.08">no I laugh at these things I sort of</text>
  <text start="1044.19" dur="3.96">expect them I had a when I first went to</text>
  <text start="1046.23" dur="4.41">DC to speak on Q not only was I deep</text>
  <text start="1048.15" dur="3.99">platformed by Jack for sobic at the</text>
  <text start="1050.64" dur="3.15">American priority conference but I was</text>
  <text start="1052.14" dur="3.66">flagged for bomb residue on the way</text>
  <text start="1053.79" dur="4.14">through by TSA I missed my first flight</text>
  <text start="1055.8" dur="3.63">and I was a day late unfortunately and</text>
  <text start="1057.93" dur="3.12">that&amp;#39;s and that kind of stuff just has</text>
  <text start="1059.43" dur="4.14">seems to happen in this lifestyle</text>
  <text start="1061.05" dur="4.2">sometimes but it&amp;#39;s worth it because you</text>
  <text start="1063.57" dur="2.85">know we are we&amp;#39;re scaring them that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1065.25" dur="2.43">why they&amp;#39;re censoring us that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1066.42" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re doubling down and then they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1231.02" dur="3.75">anymore that&amp;#39;s the difference and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1232.789" dur="3.661">how he&amp;#39;s made America great even</text>
  <text start="1234.77" dur="3.539">bringing up Hollywood I mean it seems</text>
  <text start="1236.45" dur="3.9">like conservative Hollywood like the new</text>
  <text start="1238.309" dur="3.87">version of Hollywood that it&amp;#39;s emerging</text>
  <text start="1240.35" dur="4.41">seems to be having constant success and</text>
  <text start="1242.179" dur="3.99">growth from what I&amp;#39;ve seen and that the</text>
  <text start="1244.76" dur="3.899">old style just seems to be having</text>
  <text start="1246.169" dur="5.331">constant scandals and and you know the</text>
  <text start="1248.659" dur="5.191">Weinsteins and Epstein&amp;#39;s and all of the</text>
  <text start="1251.5" dur="4.059">Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret partying with I&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1264.38" dur="3.87">you know happy and jovial here but you</text>
  <text start="1266.75" dur="4.58">know all of these different scandals are</text>
  <text start="1268.25" dur="5.909">now being sort of tied to old-school</text>
  <text start="1271.33" dur="4.39">liberal Hollywood and you can see it in</text>
  <text start="1274.159" dur="3">the movies you can see it in the films</text>
  <text start="1275.72" dur="2.939">like they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re lashing out with</text>

  <text start="1278.659" dur="3.12">everywhere that they can because they</text>
  <text start="1280.669" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t know what else to do I mean</text>
  <text start="1281.779" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re on a sinking ship just like the</text>
  <text start="1283.399" dur="5.311">mainstream news right yeah</text>
  <text start="1286.789" dur="3.961">the difference is Dustin I&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="1288.71" dur="3.569">firsthand this is what I know about it</text>
  <text start="1290.75" dur="3.45">and this is the truth because I just got</text>
  <text start="1292.279" dur="4.77">back from Hollywood probably over the</text>
  <text start="1294.2" dur="4.979">summer there is a group of people very</text>
  <text start="1297.049" dur="5.151">very influential you you would know</text>
  <text start="1299.179" dur="5.641">these people but they are closeted</text>
