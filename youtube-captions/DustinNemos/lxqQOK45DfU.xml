  <text start="89.49" dur="7.419">obviously this is at the very least a</text>
  <text start="94.09" dur="5.61">very bad joke at the most this is a</text>
  <text start="96.909" dur="5.451">threat I mean if anything this is</text>
  <text start="99.7" dur="5.22">encouraging it through violent rhetoric</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="4.24">and we know how the fake news media</text>
  <text start="104.92" dur="4.17">already like to birdwhistell to the</text>
  <text start="106.6" dur="4.32">low-hanging fruit on the left anyway the</text>
  <text start="109.09" dur="3.66">crazies that you know they hear</text>
  <text start="110.92" dur="3.479">something like hashtag hunt Republicans</text>
  <text start="112.75" dur="5.009">and then they go out and shoot up people</text>
  <text start="114.399" dur="5.061">like Scalise so you know that there are</text>
  <text start="117.759" dur="4.771">some that take it as more than a joke</text>

  <text start="122.53" dur="3.99">the gateway pondan here Obama&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="139.9" dur="5.49">Center and she&amp;#39;s wearing a burr yzma</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="5.25">jacket that&amp;#39;s very strange and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="145.39" dur="5.34">at the drill site so I mean are these</text>
  <text start="148.39" dur="4.2">guys actually doing any work for the US</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="2.46">government or do they just basically go</text>
  <text start="152.59" dur="2.73">in there</text>
  <text start="153.19" dur="4.26">under guys&amp;#39;ve office to sell us out to</text>
  <text start="155.32" dur="4.74">foreign nations and then get a kickback</text>
  <text start="157.45" dur="5.19">for it that seems to be what this is all</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="5.46">about and at least part of it obviously</text>
  <text start="162.64" dur="5.46">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of it we&amp;#39;ve now got</text>
  <text start="165.52" dur="5.07">connections to Pelosi through her son to</text>
  <text start="168.1" dur="5.88">Biden through his son to Obama through</text>
  <text start="170.59" dur="7.26">various staff so it&amp;#39;s getting kind of</text>
  <text start="173.98" dur="6.27">weird right we also have Secretary of</text>
  <text start="177.85" dur="4.56">Pompeo weary asserting and reinforcing</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="5.07">what we already knew and had already</text>
  <text start="182.41" dur="5.07">reported on that John Kerry was secretly</text>
  <text start="185.32" dur="3.87">meeting with Iranian officials to</text>
  <text start="187.48" dur="4.74">salvage Iran&amp;#39;s nuclear weapons program</text>
  <text start="189.19" dur="5.7">behind our back behind president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="5.79">back whereas he&amp;#39;s the one who sets our</text>
  <text start="194.89" dur="4.62">foreign policy his this shadow diplomacy</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="3.24">the same thing Obama was doing going</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="4.11">around behind president Trump trying to</text>
  <text start="201.25" dur="3.99">undo what he was the deals he was making</text>
  <text start="203.62" dur="4.92">remember he was following him around for</text>
  <text start="205.24" dur="5.46">a while well now we have maybe what</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="6.15">we&amp;#39;ll see is the first potential actual</text>
  <text start="210.7" dur="6">charge of the what&amp;#39;s it called there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="214.69" dur="3.99">special act the Hatch Act I believe know</text>
  <text start="216.7" dur="4.83">the Logan act in this case and so the</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="6.9">Logan Act is what Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="221.53" dur="6.03">Mike Pompeo said Trump&amp;#39;s claim that John</text>
  <text start="225.58" dur="4.04">Kerry violated the Logan Act is true so</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="4.17">you know we know that he&amp;#39;s violated it</text>
  <text start="229.62" dur="3.76">are they gonna arrest him for it or they</text>
  <text start="231.73" dur="3.63">can actually put him in prison for a</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="4.74">couple of years for it now it&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="235.36" dur="5.81">been done before but obviously what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.12" dur="5.85">doing is wrong and very irregular</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="4.93">they&amp;#39;re trying to resist President Trump</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="4.26">obviously so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s treason</text>
  <text start="246.1" dur="4.62">I mean you could call it a violation of</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="5.19">the Logan Act sure but it&amp;#39;s also treason</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="4.26">so if anything this would be a slap on</text>
  <text start="253.42" dur="5.039">the hand compared to what John Kerry</text>
  <text start="254.98" dur="5.129">should be getting now strangely we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.459" dur="2.641">gonna kind of segue and there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="2.611">other stuff here</text>
  <text start="261.1" dur="3.63">Hillary Clinton was appointed the</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="6.09">Chancellor of Queen&amp;#39;s University and</text>
  <text start="264.73" dur="7.08">Belfast I don&amp;#39;t know why but apparently</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="6.92">it&amp;#39;s a multi-year role five years roll</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="6.359">effective as of January the first 2020 I</text>
  <text start="275.73" dur="4.27">don&amp;#39;t get this I don&amp;#39;t know why she</text>
  <text start="278.169" dur="4.651">would possibly have taken this position</text>
  <text start="280" dur="4.95">I don&amp;#39;t know if that means she is or is</text>
  <text start="282.82" dur="4.2">not gonna run for president hopefully</text>
  <text start="284.95" dur="4.2">not but this is just</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="5.51">range maybe it&amp;#39;s an attempt to protect</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="7.049">or insulate her from what is coming</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="6.16">which is of course arrest and treason</text>
  <text start="296.199" dur="4.951">charges for what she&amp;#39;s done now we also</text>
  <text start="298.69" dur="5.31">have and you&amp;#39;ve probably already heard</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="4.799">about this a top Iranian commander</text>
  <text start="304" dur="4.34">killed in an airstrike at Baghdad&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.949" dur="6.21">International Airport this was a</text>
  <text start="308.34" dur="5.68">surprise attack opportunity strike there</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="4.141">you know there of course blaming the US</text>
  <text start="314.02" dur="4.709">and probably was us I mean President</text>
  <text start="316.3" dur="4.95">Trump even tweeted out a flag which</text>
  <text start="318.729" dur="5.401">we&amp;#39;ll get to in a bit right after this</text>
  <text start="321.25" dur="4.349">this hit was done but we got General</text>
  <text start="324.13" dur="3.45">Kasim soleimani</text>
  <text start="325.599" dur="4.891">or solely mommy I hope I&amp;#39;m saying that</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="5.07">right however you know this was a really</text>
  <text start="330.49" dur="4.41">bad guy possibly responsible for</text>
  <text start="332.65" dur="4.769">hundreds of thousands maybe millions of</text>
  <text start="334.9" dur="5.759">deaths and you know basically a war</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="6.391">criminal and also the top military guy</text>
  <text start="340.659" dur="5.551">in Iran so this was a very powerful</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="5.55">reaction to what just happened with our</text>
  <text start="346.21" dur="4.65">embassy and of course president Trump</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="4.02">tweeting out the flag right afterwards</text>
  <text start="350.86" dur="5.279">so yeah it&amp;#39;s just our way of being smart</text>
  <text start="353.38" dur="5.129">ass back to these guys because there are</text>
  <text start="356.139" dur="4.321">consequences for messing with the United</text>
  <text start="358.509" dur="4.291">States and we won&amp;#39;t have been Ghazis we</text>
  <text start="360.46" dur="5.22">will actually fight back as necessary</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="5.64">and protect our own so you know</text>
  <text start="365.68" dur="5.01">president Trump reacted strong and he</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="4.949">protected our troops at the Embassy and</text>
  <text start="370.69" dur="5.129">he then reacted and took out an enemy</text>
  <text start="373.389" dur="3.991">leader preemptively is what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.819" dur="5.331">saying before he did other things</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="6.21">possibly even try to take over Iraq and</text>
  <text start="381.15" dur="5.65">Iranians even are thinking president</text>
  <text start="383.59" dur="6.509">Trump using the hashtag tnx thanks POTUS</text>
  <text start="386.8" dur="6.959">for Sully mommy or solely mommy money</text>
  <text start="390.099" dur="7.551">solely money it&amp;#39;s a hard name anyway so</text>
  <text start="393.759" dur="6.361">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of anti-regime</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="4.81">sentiment in Iran and president Trump</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="4.079">has been stroking that from afar by you</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="5.31">know offering his condolences and</text>
  <text start="404.199" dur="5.34">sympathy and solidarity with especially</text>
  <text start="407.77" dur="3.09">the women but the protesters in Iran in</text>
  <text start="409.539" dur="3.541">general but especially the women that</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="4.979">are trying to get their rights back and</text>
  <text start="413.08" dur="5.519">try to unveil themselves without going</text>
  <text start="415.839" dur="3.931">to prison or be killed for it many brave</text>
  <text start="418.599" dur="2.191">women over there and of course the</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="3.41">feminists in the US</text>
  <text start="420.79" dur="4.8">there they&amp;#39;re too busy worrying about</text>
  <text start="423.18" dur="2.83">you know insane things that make no</text>
  <text start="425.59" dur="4.05">sense</text>
  <text start="426.01" dur="6.95">and man bashing so continuing on we also</text>
  <text start="429.64" dur="5.91">have the Iranian leader vowing vengeance</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="5.35">on the killers of Soleimani</text>
  <text start="435.55" dur="4.95">and of course we know that you know</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re already trying to mess with us</text>
  <text start="440.5" dur="5.25">anyway it&amp;#39;s not like they&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="441.94" dur="6.21">anything more already we may have some</text>
  <text start="445.75" dur="3.6">retaliatory terrorist attacks things</text>
  <text start="448.15" dur="2.58">like that because that&amp;#39;s about the only</text>
  <text start="449.35" dur="4.2">effective thing that they can get away</text>
  <text start="450.73" dur="4.89">with it&amp;#39;s harder for the military to do</text>
  <text start="453.55" dur="4.11">stuff about it when they when they sneak</text>
  <text start="455.62" dur="5.12">in people and go after civilians you</text>
  <text start="457.66" dur="5.46">know military US targets are too strong</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="5.83">our military is very strong right now</text>
  <text start="463.12" dur="5.85">now we also have before the US drone</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="4.5">strike there was fear that this guy</text>
  <text start="468.97" dur="5.16">soleimani the one that was taken out was</text>
  <text start="471.07" dur="5.85">in Iraq to lead a coup and maybe even to</text>
  <text start="474.13" dur="5.04">take over not only the US Embassy but</text>
  <text start="476.92" dur="5.64">the actual government by arresting</text>
  <text start="479.17" dur="5.28">president sully so this is you know</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="3.63">probably why he was taken out and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="484.45" dur="4.92">probably why they were saying that it</text>
  <text start="486.19" dur="5.4">was not retaliatory even but pre-emptive</text>
  <text start="489.37" dur="5.85">to avoid something in the future that he</text>
  <text start="491.59" dur="5.85">was about to do now interestingly not</text>
  <text start="495.22" dur="4.65">only have we had several Democrats come</text>
  <text start="497.44" dur="5.55">out and try to bash president Trump for</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="5.16">this wonderful thing that he just did we</text>
  <text start="502.99" dur="3.9">also had some of these folks that were</text>
  <text start="505.03" dur="3.78">involved in the raid having been to</text>
  <text start="506.89" dur="4.38">President Obama&amp;#39;s White House in the</text>
  <text start="508.81" dur="4.47">past one of them was even a terrorist</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="3.18">leader who had met with Obama in the</text>
  <text start="513.28" dur="5.55">White House in the past who&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="514.45" dur="5.19">arrested Hadid alomari or imary edita</text>
  <text start="518.83" dur="4.83">ala Mary</text>
  <text start="519.64" dur="7.38">now the BA D our core chief and terror</text>
  <text start="523.66" dur="5.67">leader Wow so we have a couple of more</text>
  <text start="527.02" dur="4.74">things I want to discuss yeah this one</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="4.98">is good president Trump tweets pic of</text>
  <text start="531.76" dur="5.15">American flag after top Iran commander</text>
  <text start="534.31" dur="6.03">killed an airstrike but the flag that he</text>
  <text start="536.91" dur="6.25">tweeted out this is identical I think to</text>
  <text start="540.34" dur="7.29">the flag that Q himself has posted many</text>
  <text start="543.16" dur="6.75">times on the Q boards so I think matrix</text>
  <text start="547.63" dur="4.2">actually broke down each example of how</text>
  <text start="549.91" dur="4.1">they had seen this in the past but</text>
  <text start="551.83" dur="4.43">that&amp;#39;s just one more example</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="3.9">president Trump linking to the Q</text>
  <text start="556.26" dur="3.45">movement more openly in the last couple</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="4.77">of weeks he&amp;#39;s being very brazen about it</text>
  <text start="559.71" dur="4.62">now very much in the face of the fake</text>
  <text start="562.68" dur="2.73">news and that&amp;#39;s triggering them in a big</text>
  <text start="564.33" dur="2.94">way</text>
  <text start="565.41" dur="3.78">you know brian Stelter came on and and</text>
  <text start="567.27" dur="3.42">really bashed president Trump for</text>
  <text start="569.19" dur="4.5">reshoring he went on accounts things</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="5.76">like that and then lo and behold we have</text>

  <text start="646.2" dur="3.87">haven&amp;#39;t heard about C 60 yet I highly</text>
  <text start="648.54" dur="3.81">recommend that you do some research on</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="4.11">it the short version is that it doubled</text>
  <text start="652.35" dur="3.9">the lifespan in rats when they were</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="3.99">trying to actually poison the rats and</text>
  <text start="656.25" dur="3.9">that study has led to many other</text>
  <text start="658.17" dur="4.68">interesting studies including hair</text>
  <text start="660.15" dur="5.4">regrowth of 16% in one study wrinkle</text>
  <text start="662.85" dur="4.44">repair which is a noticeable on the</text>

  <text start="667.29" dur="4.95">controlled group where the ladies did</text>

  <text start="679.95" dur="3.72">the world by the way and that helps</text>
  <text start="681.48" dur="3.9">explain its rejuvenating and protective</text>
  <text start="683.67" dur="3.419">abilities and there were other</text>
  <text start="685.38" dur="4.29">interesting things like acne</text>
  <text start="687.089" dur="4.5">reduction 86% and you know I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="689.67" dur="3.51">making any claims but this is what some</text>
  <text start="691.589" dur="3.75">of the initial studies have shown and</text>
  <text start="693.18" dur="6.089">it&amp;#39;s worth doing some research on now</text>
  <text start="695.339" dur="6.48">one of those particular studies there</text>
  <text start="699.269" dur="4.411">the beauty and the wrinkle repair factor</text>
  <text start="701.819" dur="4.08">that particular study which is linked on</text>
  <text start="703.68" dur="4.29">our website as well was really</text>
  <text start="705.899" dur="4.74">fascinating for us because we knew that</text>
  <text start="707.97" dur="4.32">you know carbon 60 is something that</text>
  <text start="710.639" dur="2.911">most people have never even heard of you</text>
  <text start="712.29" dur="4.25">know I think it&amp;#39;s the most exciting</text>
  <text start="713.55" dur="5.209">thing that&amp;#39;s happened to medicine since</text>
  <text start="716.54" dur="5.529">antibiotics or penicillin was discovered</text>
  <text start="718.759" dur="5.83">but I think this is gonna be an even</text>
  <text start="722.069" dur="3.45">bigger breakthrough even than CBD and</text>
  <text start="724.589" dur="3.6">things like that</text>
  <text start="725.519" dur="5.13">when people catch on to it but no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="728.189" dur="5.041">really figured out how to apply this new</text>
  <text start="730.649" dur="3.841">technology to a beauty product yet you</text>
  <text start="733.23" dur="3.299">know there&amp;#39;s a few people trying out</text>
  <text start="734.49" dur="3.779">different things now but we did</text>
  <text start="736.529" dur="3.091">something a little bit different we</text>
  <text start="738.269" dur="4.081">actually went to one of the leading</text>
  <text start="739.62" dur="4.439">European brands for beauty and cosmetic</text>
  <text start="742.35" dur="4.14">skincare products Akasha</text>
  <text start="744.059" dur="4.47">now Akasha actually is known for really</text>
  <text start="746.49" dur="4.139">high-end products it&amp;#39;s really expensive</text>
  <text start="748.529" dur="5.761">to get this in Europe and in Asia</text>
  <text start="750.629" dur="5.31">especially but we reformulated what they</text>
  <text start="754.29" dur="4.44">already have what are the highest level</text>
  <text start="755.939" dur="4.14">products and ingredients and in Germany</text>
  <text start="758.73" dur="3.659">where their base there&amp;#39;s actually like</text>
  <text start="760.079" dur="4.291">rules and laws around using words like</text>
  <text start="762.389" dur="4.89">organic in your cosmetics okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="764.37" dur="4.62">not true in the US and for you know for</text>
  <text start="767.279" dur="3.06">over here in the US you can you can get</text>
  <text start="768.99" dur="4.409">away with saying anything is in that</text>
  <text start="770.339" dur="4.711">bottle of makeup or that lotion or any</text>
  <text start="773.399" dur="3.66">of those cosmetic external things</text>
  <text start="775.05" dur="4.05">because there&amp;#39;s no real rules around it</text>
  <text start="777.059" dur="4.681">it&amp;#39;s not true in Germany so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="779.1" dur="3.989">actual rules that that reinforce some of</text>
  <text start="781.74" dur="4.17">the things that were claiming about the</text>
  <text start="783.089" dur="4.74">product but anyway so the ingredients</text>
  <text start="785.91" dur="4.649">are the best out there we found</text>
  <text start="787.829" dur="6.091">something that was really good amazing</text>
  <text start="790.559" dur="5.46">great well reviewed you know kind of</text>
  <text start="793.92" dur="4.44">expensive but really well worth it</text>
  <text start="796.019" dur="4.23">Beauty cream in Europe and we knocked</text>
  <text start="798.36" dur="4.409">the price way down and we added carbon</text>
  <text start="800.249" dur="4.56">shield 60 to it so you&amp;#39;re gonna then get</text>
  <text start="802.769" dur="4.17">the benefit of the wrinkle reduction</text>
  <text start="804.809" dur="5.101">from carbon 60 the world&amp;#39;s top</text>
  <text start="806.939" dur="5.911">antioxidant on top of all of the other</text>
  <text start="809.91" dur="5.31">Beauty ingredients there in this so we</text>
  <text start="812.85" dur="4.799">called it time stop hopefully you&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="817.649" dur="3.331">know it&amp;#39;s geared as a beauty cream but</text>

  <text start="820.98" dur="5.159">scalps and and things like that or you</text>
  <text start="824.16" dur="3.869">know you could even apply it for acne</text>
  <text start="826.139" dur="4.021">because people are using it for that as</text>
  <text start="828.029" dur="5.581">well because like I said to study for</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="4.919">that now beyond you know we could look</text>
  <text start="833.61" dur="3.15">into body lotions and things like that</text>
