  <text start="0" dur="5.79">now all right guys welcome back this is</text>
  <text start="3.51" dur="5.37">destiny most of destiny most calm and I</text>
  <text start="5.79" dur="5.639">am joined by Alexandra&amp;#39;s filth no I</text>
  <text start="8.88" dur="3.929">honestly this is going to be a kind of a</text>
  <text start="11.429" dur="3.21">surprise we were talking a little bit</text>
  <text start="12.809" dur="3.271">about like innovative technologies you</text>
  <text start="14.639" dur="2.97">know as I like to cover that kind of</text>
  <text start="16.08" dur="3.63">thing disruptive technologies things</text>
  <text start="17.609" dur="4.021">that can change the world and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="3.239">piqued my curiosity so we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="21.63" dur="3.54">gonna jump in we&amp;#39;re gonna have a Q&amp;amp;A</text>
  <text start="22.949" dur="3.66">session because I&amp;#39;m recording this but</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="3.39">he&amp;#39;s actually live streaming it on his</text>
  <text start="26.609" dur="3.59">own I don&amp;#39;t know how to if anyone wants</text>
  <text start="28.56" dur="3.809">to reach out and help me out with that</text>
  <text start="30.199" dur="6.04">but man if you want to introduce</text>
  <text start="32.369" dur="6.451">yourself and and we&amp;#39;ll jump into it yeah</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="3.601">so you can just call me Alexander&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="38.82" dur="5.399">filth you already did a pretty good</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="8.85">introduction so far I am a former Marine</text>
  <text start="44.219" dur="6.481">veteran and I went through electronics</text>
  <text start="48.69" dur="4.56">training school through the Unites</text>
  <text start="50.7" dur="5.31">States Marine Corps and I learned quite</text>
  <text start="53.25" dur="4.53">a bit about circuit technology and you</text>
  <text start="56.01" dur="5.029">know but the basics of like electronica</text>
  <text start="57.78" dur="6.119">theory transistor theory and so on and</text>
  <text start="61.039" dur="4.751">while I was in I was very curious to</text>
  <text start="63.899" dur="3.72">learn more about everything because</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="5.81">originally when I graduated high school</text>
  <text start="67.619" dur="5.61">I was interested in neurology and</text>
  <text start="71.6" dur="5.29">neurology really piqued my interest</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="5.581">because it&amp;#39;s just the human brain is</text>
  <text start="76.89" dur="5.43">absolutely fascinating what allows us</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="7.47">the faculties to be able to use and</text>
  <text start="82.32" dur="5.67">create language logic reason and then</text>
  <text start="86.28" dur="3.51">you know growing up and learning about</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="4.05">computers and seeing seeing everything</text>
  <text start="89.79" dur="3.78">in the world the way that I saw it it</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="4.469">became more and more fascinating to me</text>
  <text start="93.57" dur="4.38">as I grew up but seeing the climate and</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="3.511">how everything in the world had changed</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="5.099">I knew that I had to create a</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="4.62">responsibility to also consider what was</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="3.721">you know what was also going on around</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="3.479">me so I decided to join the military and</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="3.84">specifically the United States Marine</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="5.101">Corps so I pursued electronics when I</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="5.869">was in there and as I said I learned a</text>
  <text start="113.22" dur="6.24">great degree and when I got out I</text>
  <text start="116.479" dur="5.89">thought well what better way to you know</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="5.699">help and continue my work than to</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="5.691">continue to develop specific very very</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="5.041">specific technologies as they pertain to</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="4.75">you know not just electronics but</text>
  <text start="130.2" dur="3.63">computers as well and if you want to</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="3.42">talk about disruptive</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="5.7">let me just put one down right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="4.89">really simple it&amp;#39;s called a zero day</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="3.48">exploit or you have you heard of such a</text>
  <text start="141.12" dur="3.71">thing and it&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="5.04">can wipe out the entire internet ring</text>
  <text start="144.83" dur="6.31">well zero day exploit is just any kind</text>
  <text start="148.05" dur="7.97">of electronic exploit that has the</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="7.32">ability to severely impact our</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="6.34">electronic lifestyle as it pertains to</text>
  <text start="158.46" dur="6.39">computers the world wide web banking any</text>
  <text start="162.36" dur="4.02">sophisticated electronic system you</text>
  <text start="164.85" dur="5.72">could say that a zero day exploit for</text>
  <text start="166.38" dur="6.84">example would be an EMP right if you had</text>
  <text start="170.57" dur="5.08">if you had a simple way to deliver an</text>
  <text start="173.22" dur="4.23">EMP strategically that would be a zero</text>
  <text start="175.65" dur="4.32">day exploit for example wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="177.45" dur="5.85">necessarily have to be a computer bug</text>
  <text start="179.97" dur="4.8">right but specifically what I&amp;#39;m what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="4.65">working on could be considered the</text>
  <text start="184.77" dur="6.36">computer bug variety and it applies to</text>
  <text start="187.95" dur="5.25">all computer systems that are in use</text>
  <text start="191.13" dur="6.45">today all over the world all of them all</text>
  <text start="193.2" dur="5.759">at once well okay so you have to you</text>
  <text start="197.58" dur="5.4">have to you can&amp;#39;t leave us hang in there</text>
  <text start="198.959" dur="7.581">what is this about ok so right around</text>
  <text start="202.98" dur="7.74">the 1940s there was a very very</text>
  <text start="206.54" dur="6.46">ingenious man whose name was John von</text>
  <text start="210.72" dur="4.47">Neumann you can do a little bit of</text>
  <text start="213" dur="4.08">research about him but he&amp;#39;s probably one</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="3">of the last great geniuses that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="217.08" dur="3.3">born in quite some time</text>
  <text start="218.19" dur="5.85">up there with likes of Tesla and so on</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="5.85">and he was a great visionary as well and</text>
  <text start="224.04" dur="4.26">he worked on the original programmable</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="4.59">computers that ENIAC in the advanced and</text>
  <text start="228.3" dur="4.05">in fact he also worked with another</text>
  <text start="230.82" dur="4.74">gentleman that people are probably</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="5.52">familiar with the name of who is Alan</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="4.2">Turing and Alan Turing you know we have</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="5.28">a Turing machine yeah that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="239.76" dur="5.31">yeah so John von Neumann in Turing were</text>
  <text start="243.15" dur="3.66">literally at the forefront of all</text>
  <text start="245.07" dur="3.57">computing technology when it first came</text>
  <text start="246.81" dur="6.72">out you know this is of course way after</text>
  <text start="248.64" dur="7.349">Babbage but he designed a kind of</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="6.179">computing architecture that would make</text>
  <text start="255.989" dur="7.05">it simple and easy for the computers to</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="4.741">be built manufactured and programmed so</text>
  <text start="263.039" dur="3.241">here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the deal</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="3.3">so you get five different people and you</text>
  <text start="266.28" dur="2.55">tell them you can make a car</text>
  <text start="267.75" dur="1.98">and what are you going to end up with</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re gonna end up with five different</text>
  <text start="269.73" dur="5.31">varieties of car and you&amp;#39;re gonna end up</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="3.93">with having five different schools with</text>
  <text start="275.04" dur="4.44">five different types of engineers for</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="4.92">each one of those cars so john von</text>
  <text start="279.48" dur="3.81">neumann realized the importance of the</text>
  <text start="281.76" dur="3.87">computing technology and said well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.29" dur="4.62">make a standard right away and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="4.53">called the von neumann architecture you</text>
  <text start="287.91" dur="3.96">know I think I&amp;#39;ve heard of that the name</text>
  <text start="290.16" dur="4.26">von Neumann was familiar to me but I</text>
  <text start="291.87" dur="4.92">knew nothing about it yeah</text>
  <text start="294.42" dur="5.04">so John Von Neumanns architecture type</text>
  <text start="296.79" dur="6.45">basically has some very basic</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="6.09">instructions on how to design a computer</text>
  <text start="303.24" dur="6.08">that can handle digital bits which is</text>
  <text start="305.55" dur="7.29">just ones and zeros binary code however</text>
  <text start="309.32" dur="7">what what I&amp;#39;m I feel certain that he was</text>
  <text start="312.84" dur="5.43">aware of but was not was not going to</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="4.44">make other people privy to was that</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="5.1">there was a bottleneck in the von</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="6.18">Neumann architecture and what I mean by</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="5.28">that is when you send a instruction to</text>
  <text start="326.94" dur="5.19">your microprocessor you can&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s like a black box so it goes into</text>
  <text start="332.13" dur="3.48">the microprocessor the processor does</text>
  <text start="333.75" dur="3.99">its job and it spits back out the</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="4.65">information it&amp;#39;s a one-way system</text>
  <text start="337.74" dur="6.03">information goes in it does its thing</text>
  <text start="340.26" dur="5.7">and information comes out that is the</text>
  <text start="343.77" dur="6.27">bottleneck the computer cannot send and</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="6.209">receive information duplex not like a</text>
  <text start="350.04" dur="3.45">telephone system can not like what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.169" dur="4.531">doing right now in fact I&amp;#39;m going live</text>
  <text start="353.49" dur="4.44">on three devices at once problem yeah</text>
  <text start="356.7" dur="3.38">and it&amp;#39;s all in the same internet</text>
  <text start="357.93" dur="4.68">connection which is really fantastic and</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="4.27">the reason why I have to use three</text>
  <text start="362.61" dur="3.12">devices is because of the von Neumann</text>
  <text start="364.35" dur="4.41">bottleneck otherwise I could just go</text>
  <text start="365.73" dur="5.37">live on all three applications on my</text>
  <text start="368.76" dur="6.06">phone all at once and there wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="371.1" dur="6.45">a problem so I found an exploit that</text>
  <text start="374.82" dur="5.79">actually transforms the von Neumann</text>
  <text start="377.55" dur="7.89">architecture and breaks the von Neumann</text>
  <text start="380.61" dur="8.07">bottleneck okay and will allow anyone to</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="5.64">be able to do lots more on their devices</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="6.09">their modern devices than would normally</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="6.24">be applicable or allowable Wow okay so</text>
  <text start="394.77" dur="5.669">that I mean I can already see like a lot</text>
  <text start="397.32" dur="5.849">of potential there correct please don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="400.439" dur="4.5">so the applications are not all</text>
  <text start="403.169" dur="3.72">wonderful right of course all the</text>
  <text start="404.939" dur="3.75">medical applications it will have all</text>
  <text start="406.889" dur="5.7">the scientific discoveries that it will</text>
  <text start="408.689" dur="5.88">lead to yeah it can in a contextual base</text>
  <text start="412.589" dur="5.64">let&amp;#39;s just call it in a simplistic form</text>
  <text start="414.569" dur="5.761">virtual quantum computing right because</text>
  <text start="418.229" dur="4.74">what we do with a regular quantum</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="6.569">computer now turns a standard transistor</text>
  <text start="422.969" dur="5.641">into the double-slit experiment which</text>
  <text start="426.899" dur="3.36">basically if you know anything about the</text>
  <text start="428.61" dur="3.5">double slit experiment it allows the</text>
  <text start="430.259" dur="5.75">single transistor to become an</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="5.919">invertible infinite quanta of outputs I</text>
  <text start="436.009" dur="3.58">know that part of it the technical</text>
  <text start="438.029" dur="2.88">aspect that I remember reading and</text>
  <text start="439.589" dur="3.84">watching videos about it where they</text>
  <text start="440.909" dur="4.53">could and it was something about like</text>
  <text start="443.429" dur="4.95">you&amp;#39;re perceiving and changed that the</text>
  <text start="445.439" dur="5.12">output and that was masked consciousness</text>
  <text start="448.379" dur="5.84">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a little bit more than that</text>
  <text start="450.559" dur="6.19">but the the computer has absolute focus</text>
  <text start="454.219" dur="3.82">that&amp;#39;s the real key everybody thinks</text>
  <text start="456.749" dur="3.6">that computers are more powerful than</text>
  <text start="458.039" dur="4.71">humans they&amp;#39;re really not the hardware</text>
  <text start="460.349" dur="4.08">is very limited and so there&amp;#39;s only you</text>
  <text start="462.749" dur="3.42">know millions in in fact now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="464.429" dur="3.6">trillions of transistors inside of most</text>
  <text start="466.169" dur="3.84">micro processors nowadays but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.029" dur="4.081">still not anywhere near sophisticated</text>
  <text start="470.009" dur="4.53">enough to be able to beat one axon and</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="3.779">neuron inside the human brain in its</text>
  <text start="474.539" dur="2.85">sophistication and its ability to</text>
  <text start="475.889" dur="4.89">process information and recognize</text>
  <text start="477.389" dur="5.19">patterns so yeah even even this</text>
  <text start="480.779" dur="3.961">technology even my software has its</text>
  <text start="482.579" dur="6.36">limitations and so you know you</text>
  <text start="484.74" dur="6.239">I&amp;#39;m not worried about like a Skynet type</text>
  <text start="488.939" dur="4.68">situation but what I am concerned about</text>
  <text start="490.979" dur="5.04">is that because it makes hardware that</text>
  <text start="493.619" dur="5.52">much more powerful those that know how</text>
  <text start="496.019" dur="6.51">to use their hardware well already will</text>
  <text start="499.139" dur="5.13">be able to leverage it against all kinds</text>
  <text start="502.529" dur="4.081">of people and it won&amp;#39;t necessarily be in</text>
  <text start="504.269" dur="3.69">good ways what are you afraid of like</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="3.779">what are some of the examples you can</text>
  <text start="507.959" dur="6.091">think ok well let&amp;#39;s just say for example</text>
  <text start="510.389" dur="6.06">you could send a little bit of code to</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="5.519">every single satellite in orbit all at</text>
  <text start="516.449" dur="6.36">once and then make them crash ok so</text>
  <text start="519.569" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;re talking some serious danger it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="522.809" dur="4.38">real zero day exploit and it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="525.059" dur="4.621">it affects the hardware at such a</text>
  <text start="527.189" dur="6.781">fundamental level it affects all modern</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="7.699">hardware in fact what I</text>
  <text start="533.97" dur="7.109">design is for x86 32-bit and 64-bit</text>
  <text start="537.379" dur="6.611">machines however if you&amp;#39;re using a</text>
  <text start="541.079" dur="5.61">32-bit machine you could reconfigure the</text>
  <text start="543.99" dur="4.469">software to work on a much smaller</text>
  <text start="546.689" dur="3.871">device you could make it work on a</text>
  <text start="548.459" dur="5.101">16-bit in 8-bit and so on and so forth</text>
  <text start="550.56" dur="4.379">and in fact I&amp;#39;m very curious because</text>
  <text start="553.56" dur="2.399">they&amp;#39;re working on Babbage&amp;#39;s machine</text>
  <text start="554.939" dur="3.061">right now they&amp;#39;re building the</text>
  <text start="555.959" dur="4.081">analytical engine in real life I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="558" dur="4.41">curious to see if it will be capable of</text>
  <text start="560.04" dur="6.06">running on Babbage&amp;#39;s mechanical computer</text>
  <text start="562.41" dur="5.279">which is which would be fantastic in a</text>
  <text start="566.1" dur="3.419">way let me just give a brief explanation</text>
  <text start="567.689" dur="2.64">without getting too technical into it</text>
  <text start="569.519" dur="5.401">please</text>
  <text start="570.329" dur="6.87">so most software you have to human has</text>
  <text start="574.92" dur="3.779">to initiate the software I have to tell</text>
  <text start="577.199" dur="4.591">the software I have to give it a command</text>
  <text start="578.699" dur="5.401">and I say okay go write and to some</text>
  <text start="581.79" dur="4.77">degree we can automate that but even</text>
  <text start="584.1" dur="5.279">still the human has to initiate that I</text>
  <text start="586.56" dur="4.62">have to say I have to put in a few lines</text>
  <text start="589.379" dur="3.45">of code that runs this loop and says</text>
  <text start="591.18" dur="2.909">okay when information goes in it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="592.829" dur="3.541">to go here or it&amp;#39;s going to go there</text>
  <text start="594.089" dur="4.47">right and so that automation process</text>
  <text start="596.37" dur="4.86">still has to be initiated by a human and</text>
  <text start="598.559" dur="5.791">it still requires certain laws and rules</text>
  <text start="601.23" dur="6.599">logic base that allows the hardware to</text>

  <text start="614.339" dur="7.56">its own language and what this does is</text>
  <text start="619.11" dur="5.039">it basically turns the computer into a</text>

  <text start="626.79" dur="7.83">to manage itself better okay so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.819" dur="3.06">say for example in the same way that I</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="2.699">look in the mirror in the morning and</text>
  <text start="635.879" dur="3.721">I&amp;#39;ve got a zit and I&amp;#39;m like oh man I</text>

  <text start="639.6" dur="4.169">medicine on and you know my appearance</text>
  <text start="641.519" dur="4.141">will be a little bit better right the</text>
  <text start="643.769" dur="4.05">computer kind of will have the same kind</text>
  <text start="645.66" dur="5.19">of ability it will be able to see its</text>

  <text start="650.85" dur="3.929">there&amp;#39;s a problem and it will be able to</text>
  <text start="652.889" dur="4.411">repair that problem or change its matrix</text>
  <text start="654.779" dur="5.401">so that it can better I guess you could</text>
  <text start="657.3" dur="4.68">say move that problem around so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="660.18" dur="3.389">talking so I understand course</text>
  <text start="661.98" dur="2.37">correction but not necessarily like</text>
  <text start="663.569" dur="4.291">creativity</text>
  <text start="664.35" dur="6.21">correct yeah it still falls under some</text>
  <text start="667.86" dur="6.95">very very finite rules in fact the the</text>
  <text start="670.56" dur="4.25">correct term for it would be Oh</text>
  <text start="678.56" dur="6.67">non-deterministic finite automata okay</text>
  <text start="682.62" dur="4.38">so think about when a baby is born how</text>
  <text start="685.23" dur="3.15">the baby is completely blind and is kind</text>
  <text start="687" dur="3.42">of crawling around and trying to figure</text>
  <text start="688.38" dur="3.78">out what&amp;#39;s going on in the world the</text>
  <text start="690.42" dur="3.93">computer is actually inside of a much</text>
  <text start="692.16" dur="3.72">larger city the microprocessor which has</text>
  <text start="694.35" dur="4.229">millions and millions of transistors in</text>
  <text start="695.88" dur="4.35">it right and so the electricity is kind</text>
  <text start="698.579" dur="4.621">of crawling around trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="700.23" dur="6.419">its way inside the machine to do the job</text>
  <text start="703.2" dur="5.25">that it&amp;#39;s being asked to do and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="706.649" dur="4.111">very very small if it&amp;#39;s inside the</text>
  <text start="708.45" dur="3.78">microprocessor so it uses up roughly one</text>
  <text start="710.76" dur="4.44">to two percent of the microprocessor</text>
  <text start="712.23" dur="5.07">stroke total power it&amp;#39;s capacity and so</text>
  <text start="715.2" dur="4.71">everything else windows will still work</text>
  <text start="717.3" dur="4.32">you know Linux will still work Android</text>
  <text start="719.91" dur="3.419">will still work iOS will still work</text>
  <text start="721.62" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;ll still do the same functions it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="723.329" dur="3.601">still work the same way it will just</text>
  <text start="725.04" dur="4.59">work better because what the software</text>
  <text start="726.93" dur="6.21">does is it manages the hardware at the</text>
  <text start="729.63" dur="6.019">very lowest level that&amp;#39;s very fine</text>
  <text start="733.14" dur="5.25">tuning right there that&amp;#39;s very well</text>
  <text start="735.649" dur="4.481">here&amp;#39;s the deal so when when john von</text>
  <text start="738.39" dur="3.99">neumann came up with the idea of the von</text>
  <text start="740.13" dur="4.17">neumann architecture i&amp;#39;m not sure he was</text>
  <text start="742.38" dur="4.29">aware about how far we would actually</text>
  <text start="744.3" dur="3.87">take the microprocessor before we came</text>
  <text start="746.67" dur="2.849">up with some innovations that kind of</text>
  <text start="748.17" dur="4.44">would break that architecture and we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="749.519" dur="5.161">come up with a better idea so we</text>
  <text start="752.61" dur="4.56">actually got really really far we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="754.68" dur="5.219">created okay to put it in perspective we</text>
  <text start="757.17" dur="6.33">created cities on microchips that are</text>
  <text start="759.899" dur="6.06">three to ten times the size of Tokyo in</text>
  <text start="763.5" dur="5.1">sophistication okay</text>
  <text start="765.959" dur="4.981">I mean yeah they come a long way with</text>
  <text start="768.6" dur="4.89">with with what we have with these</text>
  <text start="770.94" dur="3.899">computers where I mean we haven&amp;#39;t gone</text>
  <text start="773.49" dur="3.9">to that next thing that just completely</text>
  <text start="774.839" dur="6.06">destroys this whole system and makes the</text>
  <text start="777.39" dur="5.759">start of something new absolutely so if</text>
  <text start="780.899" dur="4.111">you think about it if a human you know</text>
  <text start="783.149" dur="4.141">we can design we could build a city and</text>
  <text start="785.01" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;ve done it right and we built these</text>
  <text start="787.29" dur="4.2">microchips but do you think a human how</text>
  <text start="789.3" dur="4.529">long would it take us to build a</text>
  <text start="791.49" dur="4.08">software traffic management system which</text>
  <text start="793.829" dur="4.32">we haven&amp;#39;t done by the way that is</text>
  <text start="795.57" dur="5.459">capable of managing a city like Tokyo in</text>
  <text start="798.149" dur="3.091">a very efficient manner we haven&amp;#39;t done</text>
  <text start="801.029" dur="2.461">it</text>
  <text start="801.24" dur="3.96">have we know you think that the software</text>
  <text start="803.49" dur="3.24">that we&amp;#39;re currently using to manage the</text>
  <text start="805.2" dur="3.57">hardware that we have do you think</text>
  <text start="806.73" dur="3.979">because it&amp;#39;s made by humans do you think</text>
  <text start="808.77" dur="4.259">that it&amp;#39;s actually doing a very good job</text>
  <text start="810.709" dur="4.69">now they can barely get the traffic</text>
  <text start="813.029" dur="4.531">lights to work right there you go so</text>
  <text start="815.399" dur="4.111">what I&amp;#39;m doing is I&amp;#39;m making a traffic</text>
  <text start="817.56" dur="4.29">management system for the hardware that</text>
  <text start="819.51" dur="4.139">we currently have and what it does is it</text>
  <text start="821.85" dur="4.38">writes the software it writes the</text>
  <text start="823.649" dur="4.591">management system for every single</text>
  <text start="826.23" dur="3.93">processor that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s a zero-day</text>
  <text start="828.24" dur="7.289">exploit because it works on every piece</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="8.549">of hardware in existence okay so we kind</text>
  <text start="835.529" dur="5.611">of I guess I kind of have an I grab</text>
  <text start="838.709" dur="3.841">basic grasp of how big this is what do</text>
  <text start="841.14" dur="2.819">you where do you want to take this thing</text>
  <text start="842.55" dur="4.02">what&amp;#39;s possible what can we do with it</text>
  <text start="843.959" dur="3.901">I&amp;#39;ll tell you what my original purpose</text>
  <text start="846.57" dur="2.82">and intent was because that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="847.86" dur="3.3">what matters when it comes to any kind</text>
  <text start="849.39" dur="2.88">of new technology when somebody invents</text>
  <text start="851.16" dur="3.03">something what was the purpose and</text>
  <text start="852.27" dur="4.14">intent behind you you know nuclear</text>
  <text start="854.19" dur="4.92">energy its purpose and intent was to</text>
  <text start="856.41" dur="4.98">help mankind and of course you know we</text>
  <text start="859.11" dur="4.77">kind of went awry there on the purpose</text>
  <text start="861.39" dur="4.58">and intent behind this is to gift</text>
  <text start="863.88" dur="5.28">mankind with faster than light travel</text>
  <text start="865.97" dur="8.89">and no I&amp;#39;m not kidding okay so you have</text>
  <text start="869.16" dur="6.9">to explain that one yeah so there was it</text>
  <text start="874.86" dur="4.099">there was a gentleman who theorized</text>
  <text start="876.06" dur="8.31">about the possibility of being able to</text>
  <text start="878.959" dur="7.481">shift or warp space itself so if you</text>
  <text start="884.37" dur="4.56">think about matter everything that we</text>
  <text start="886.44" dur="3.99">can see and touch you know everything</text>
  <text start="888.93" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s real that we say that is real in</text>
  <text start="890.43" dur="4.64">the world we can call that counter space</text>
  <text start="892.95" dur="4.23">right because it&amp;#39;s not space and</text>
  <text start="895.07" dur="6.88">everything that&amp;#39;s in between that is</text>
  <text start="897.18" dur="7.59">space okay okay so think about matter</text>
  <text start="901.95" dur="5.37">not as the river but think about the</text>
  <text start="904.77" dur="5.97">matter as the crumbs that are scattered</text>
  <text start="907.32" dur="7.38">in the flow of the river okay in space</text>
  <text start="910.74" dur="5.61">is the river there is no place in the</text>
  <text start="914.7" dur="6.69">universe that space does not touch</text>
  <text start="916.35" dur="7.5">itself okay it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a true fact you</text>
  <text start="921.39" dur="3.99">can&amp;#39;t get away from it so if we say that</text>
  <text start="923.85" dur="3.51">the universe is expanding and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="925.38" dur="5.49">infinitely large then what does that</text>
  <text start="927.36" dur="7.77">mean it means that space must travel</text>
  <text start="930.87" dur="7.77">faster than light by a very large magnet</text>
  <text start="935.13" dur="5.64">- in fact okay so if I was gonna play a</text>
  <text start="938.64" dur="4.62">part like Pecos Bill right and I took my</text>
  <text start="940.77" dur="4.53">magic lasso and I said oh come here her</text>
  <text start="943.26" dur="4.26">tornado right and I lassoed onto that</text>
  <text start="945.3" dur="4.11">tornado I could actually grab on to the</text>
  <text start="947.52" dur="5.16">force of nature itself and kind of</text>
  <text start="949.41" dur="5.22">electron for a ride good not okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="952.68" dur="5.43">essentially that&amp;#39;s essentially what my</text>
  <text start="954.63" dur="5.22">technology does is it lets you because</text>
  <text start="958.11" dur="4.47">in space there&amp;#39;s nothing holding you in</text>
  <text start="959.85" dur="4.26">any one place there&amp;#39;s no inertial forces</text>
  <text start="962.58" dur="3.75">that are pushing you in any one</text>
  <text start="964.11" dur="3.54">direction unless you have something that</text>
  <text start="966.33" dur="2.64">actually pushed you in that direction to</text>
  <text start="967.65" dur="2.28">begin with right we&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="968.97" dur="2.52">forces of inertia and laws</text>
  <text start="969.93" dur="4.53">thermodynamics and it goes back to</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="4.38">Newton&amp;#39;s laws inertia an object in</text>
  <text start="974.46" dur="2.85">motion stays in motion unless acted upon</text>
  <text start="975.87" dur="3.18">by an outside force an object at rest</text>
  <text start="977.31" dur="4.71">stays rest unless acted upon by an</text>
  <text start="979.05" dur="5.34">outside force so all objects all masses</text>
  <text start="982.02" dur="4.38">all counterspace is enacting itself</text>
  <text start="984.39" dur="6.3">equally on all objects in the vacuum of</text>
  <text start="986.4" dur="6.54">space equally okay and so if you wanted</text>
  <text start="990.69" dur="3.75">to fall let&amp;#39;s say right because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="992.94" dur="3.6">no up down left right forward backward</text>
  <text start="994.44" dur="5.27">in space then what you would have to do</text>
  <text start="996.54" dur="5.79">is find a way to sort of let inertia</text>
  <text start="999.71" dur="6.1">fall away from you and stop grabbing on</text>
  <text start="1002.33" dur="5.13">to you and that&amp;#39;s how this works is you</text>
  <text start="1005.81" dur="4.98">would just kind of point yourself in the</text>
  <text start="1007.46" dur="5.85">direction you want to go and make a hole</text>
  <text start="1010.79" dur="4.71">and you would just fall and you would</text>
  <text start="1013.31" dur="3.69">fall as fast as space is moving you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1015.5" dur="4.65">literally just drop right into the river</text>
  <text start="1017" dur="5.7">stream so it&amp;#39;s easy would almost be like</text>
  <text start="1020.15" dur="5.64">just teleporting to the next place well</text>
  <text start="1022.7" dur="4.83">yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the end of</text>
  <text start="1025.79" dur="3.21">my technology and I&amp;#39;m not ready to give</text>
  <text start="1027.53" dur="3.15">that to mankind and the truth behind</text>
  <text start="1029" dur="3.51">that is that we&amp;#39;re not responsible</text>
  <text start="1030.68" dur="3.149">enough to tie our own shoes and not kill</text>
  <text start="1032.51" dur="4.89">ourselves on our own planet and destroy</text>
  <text start="1033.829" dur="4.981">our resources I think oh yeah technology</text>
  <text start="1037.4" dur="3.689">like that would be terribly weaponize</text>
  <text start="1038.81" dur="3.899">Abul so that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why I</text>
  <text start="1041.089" dur="3.391">have to be very careful about what I</text>
  <text start="1042.709" dur="3.24">talk about and how I the direction that</text>
  <text start="1044.48" dur="5.25">I kind of pointing I mean with the</text>
  <text start="1045.949" dur="7.231">technology but the the end of it is that</text>
  <text start="1049.73" dur="5.49">mankind is not capable of manipulating a</text>
  <text start="1053.18" dur="4.98">spacecraft that is traveling 10,000</text>
  <text start="1055.22" dur="5.33">times the speed of light who stays who</text>
  <text start="1058.16" dur="5.55">wants to drive it raise your hand not me</text>
  <text start="1060.55" dur="4.81">yeah well see objects objects in space</text>
  <text start="1063.71" dur="2.79">are not going to stop moving they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1065.36" dur="3.18">going to continue to move even though</text>
  <text start="1066.5" dur="2.429">you&amp;#39;re moving relatively fast compared</text>
  <text start="1068.54" dur="1.56">to</text>
  <text start="1068.929" dur="3.031">all the counter space it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1070.1" dur="4.47">still spinning around the center of the</text>
  <text start="1071.96" dur="4.289">universe right and is expanding outwards</text>
  <text start="1074.57" dur="4.049">so you&amp;#39;re going to have to make course</text>
  <text start="1076.249" dur="5.071">corrections and think five ten fifteen</text>
  <text start="1078.619" dur="3.93">moves ahead or human can&amp;#39;t do that we</text>
  <text start="1081.32" dur="2.37">lacked the focus to do that remember</text>
  <text start="1082.549" dur="3.781">what I said about the software it has</text>
  <text start="1083.69" dur="5.579">absolute focus that&amp;#39;s the real purpose</text>
  <text start="1086.33" dur="4.469">behind the software that&amp;#39;s the reason</text>
  <text start="1089.269" dur="4.971">why I invented somewhere in the first</text>
  <text start="1090.799" dur="6.38">place was to provide us a navigatable</text>
  <text start="1094.24" dur="9.189">capability for the future of spaceflight</text>
  <text start="1097.179" dur="8.411">okay well so how difficult is this to</text>
  <text start="1103.429" dur="3.931">use to utilize this kind of thing are</text>
  <text start="1105.59" dur="3.63">you talking billions of production or</text>
  <text start="1107.36" dur="5.61">you talk in DIY at home I mean what do</text>
  <text start="1109.22" dur="4.86">we yeah I mean I&amp;#39;m poor I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m dirt or</text>
  <text start="1112.97" dur="3.169">I&amp;#39;m doing this on a shoestring budget</text>
  <text start="1114.08" dur="4.709">I&amp;#39;m just putting ones and zeros together</text>
  <text start="1116.139" dur="5.711">it&amp;#39;s the the base software is called the</text>
  <text start="1118.789" dur="7.201">terminal and the terminal which is the</text>
  <text start="1121.85" dur="5.73">management software is four million bits</text>
  <text start="1125.99" dur="4.559">now to put that in perspective</text>
  <text start="1127.58" dur="5.37">four million bits not bytes okay eight</text>
  <text start="1130.549" dur="5.88">bits is in a byte so four million bits</text>
  <text start="1132.95" dur="4.65">is about half a megabyte so you can fit</text>
  <text start="1136.429" dur="4.161">this on a three and a half inch floppy</text>
  <text start="1137.6" dur="6.48">with room to spare Wow that&amp;#39;s all deck</text>
  <text start="1140.59" dur="6.039">yeah and and I&amp;#39;m basically writing this</text>
  <text start="1144.08" dur="4.77">on a very very old x86 32-bit laptop</text>
  <text start="1146.629" dur="5.601">that runs on a battery and I chose this</text>
  <text start="1148.85" dur="7.23">laptop specifically because the software</text>
  <text start="1152.23" dur="5.74">leverages the superscalar capabilities</text>
  <text start="1156.08" dur="3.299">of the intel pentium processor and</text>
  <text start="1157.97" dur="5.159">processors that are produced afterwards</text>
  <text start="1159.379" dur="6.841">and what this means is that it</text>
  <text start="1163.129" dur="4.68">manipulates a triangle way an</text>
  <text start="1166.22" dur="4.169">electromagnetic wave that actually</text>

  <text start="1182.899" dur="3.061">pass electricity through it and you you</text>
  <text start="1184.7" dur="3.929">know you get a magnetic field around</text>
  <text start="1185.96" dur="4.26">that wire right and that&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="1188.629" dur="3.9">inside your microprocessor but a very</text>
  <text start="1190.22" dur="4.98">very very small scale so what I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="1192.529" dur="4.62">is I&amp;#39;m initiating that magnetic field to</text>

  <text start="1202.64" dur="7.86">me it&amp;#39;s automating itself okay so what</text>
  <text start="1207.62" dur="5.46">this means is this triangle wave it can</text>
  <text start="1210.5" dur="5.01">actually sort of climb up other circuits</text>
  <text start="1213.08" dur="5.49">it will permeate every part of the</text>

  <text start="1228.32" dur="7.32">that&amp;#39;s inside of a computer including</text>
  <text start="1230.66" dur="8.1">the DC power supply so imagine a 60</text>
  <text start="1235.64" dur="4.98">Hertz signal now what&amp;#39;s what is hf what</text>
  <text start="1238.76" dur="3.42">is high frequency radio if you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1240.62" dur="4.08">do like a radio broadcast well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1242.18" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s about 60 Hertz isn&amp;#39;t it somewhere</text>
  <text start="1244.7" dur="4.59">in that range</text>
  <text start="1245.39" dur="6.39">so that&amp;#39;s low frequency propagation by</text>
  <text start="1249.29" dur="4.29">the way high frequency is you know</text>
  <text start="1251.78" dur="5.67">somewhere in the range anywhere from</text>
  <text start="1253.58" dur="7.29">like 10 to you know 15 or so megahertz</text>
  <text start="1257.45" dur="6.12">million Hertz so if I can run 60 Hertz</text>
  <text start="1260.87" dur="4.83">and this can climb up that signal path</text>
  <text start="1263.57" dur="3.6">then of course it no longer needs a</text>
  <text start="1265.7" dur="2.52">regular Ethernet connection to be able</text>
  <text start="1267.17" dur="4.26">to make connections to other machines</text>
  <text start="1268.22" dur="4.5">and propagate okay now you understand</text>
  <text start="1271.43" dur="2.91">why I&amp;#39;m doing it on a specialized</text>
  <text start="1272.72" dur="6.27">machine because I don&amp;#39;t want that to</text>
  <text start="1274.34" dur="6.9">happen yeah okay so you&amp;#39;re talking a new</text>
  <text start="1278.99" dur="4.68">form of internet as well correct yeah</text>
  <text start="1281.24" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s exactly one of our goals that our</text>
  <text start="1283.67" dur="3.24">organization has is to provide a global</text>
  <text start="1285.41" dur="6.42">free internet service provider for</text>
  <text start="1286.91" dur="8.55">everyone okay so so what how do we how</text>
  <text start="1291.83" dur="6.3">do we get this provable to the world and</text>
  <text start="1295.46" dur="5.46">how do we start using it yeah so right</text>
  <text start="1298.13" dur="4.41">now we&amp;#39;re just trying to release our app</text>
  <text start="1300.92" dur="3.84">so that we can get everybody on the same</text>
  <text start="1302.54" dur="5.67">page and get everybody in the world free</text>
  <text start="1304.76" dur="6.81">speech in the old days we had telephones</text>
  <text start="1308.21" dur="5.91">and you would pay what&amp;#39;s called long</text>
  <text start="1311.57" dur="3.99">long distance service fee and the long</text>
  <text start="1314.12" dur="3.75">distance service fee was actually a big</text>
  <text start="1315.56" dur="4.86">ruse a big lie it was just a way that</text>
  <text start="1317.87" dur="7.58">the government&amp;#39;s got together and they</text>
  <text start="1320.42" dur="8.22">agreed that people that weren&amp;#39;t wealthy</text>
  <text start="1325.45" dur="6.4">would not be able to use telephone and</text>
  <text start="1328.64" dur="4.65">contact people long distances so the</text>
  <text start="1331.85" dur="2.94">very wealthy would be able to use this</text>
  <text start="1333.29" dur="2.259">obviously because they could afford it</text>
  <text start="1334.79" dur="3.07">and</text>
  <text start="1335.549" dur="5.401">you know they were concerned about the</text>
  <text start="1337.86" dur="5.34">lowlifes the people like us climbing up</text>
  <text start="1340.95" dur="4.289">the food chain too quickly and of course</text>
  <text start="1343.2" dur="3.839">overtaking the government and that sort</text>
  <text start="1345.239" dur="3.121">of thing so that we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1347.039" dur="2.7">long-distance service anymore because</text>
  <text start="1348.36" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;ve got different systems controls</text>
  <text start="1349.739" dur="3.721">in place that prevent us for being able</text>
  <text start="1352.019" dur="3.54">to do these things and get famous too</text>
  <text start="1353.46" dur="4.349">quickly and get the word out and warn</text>
  <text start="1355.559" dur="3.391">people and so on and so forth so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1357.809" dur="2.94">one of the reasons why I&amp;#39;m having this</text>
  <text start="1358.95" dur="3.179">broadcast is I want to make sure I sort</text>
  <text start="1360.749" dur="3.51">of pass this information along to other</text>
  <text start="1362.129" dur="3.93">individuals what we&amp;#39;re doing is we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1364.259" dur="4.591">kind of reinventing the telephone</text>
  <text start="1366.059" dur="5.43">service with this app and we&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="1368.85" dur="6.24">it so that we can break the ties that</text>
  <text start="1371.489" dur="6.54">bind everybody by sort of breaking that</text>
  <text start="1375.09" dur="5.449">long-distance service contract so think</text>
  <text start="1378.029" dur="6.451">about it like you would use this app in</text>
  <text start="1380.539" dur="5.77">China now China has controls on their</text>
  <text start="1384.48" dur="3.84">population where there&amp;#39;s certain IPS</text>
  <text start="1386.309" dur="3.6">that they can&amp;#39;t use servers they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1388.32" dur="4.319">allowed to connect to they can&amp;#39;t use</text>
  <text start="1389.909" dur="4.98">certain US services etc we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1392.639" dur="4.681">get around that we&amp;#39;re going to allow</text>
  <text start="1394.889" dur="3.9">them to access US services so that they</text>
  <text start="1397.32" dur="2.76">can have the right of the freedom of</text>
  <text start="1398.789" dur="3.691">speech which is available here in the</text>
  <text start="1400.08" dur="4.289">United States anywhere in the world by</text>
  <text start="1402.48" dur="3.449">using this app that&amp;#39;s massive and they</text>
  <text start="1404.369" dur="2.731">definitely wanted they&amp;#39;re doing all the</text>
  <text start="1405.929" dur="2.37">crypto even though the government</text>
  <text start="1407.1" dur="4.35">doesn&amp;#39;t want them to they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="1408.299" dur="4.801">correct yeah and you can&amp;#39;t stop them so</text>
  <text start="1411.45" dur="5.309">we&amp;#39;re just going to facilitate that and</text>
  <text start="1413.1" dur="5.309">once that kind of happens it will it</text>
  <text start="1416.759" dur="3.691">will kind of scramble the fighters it</text>
  <text start="1418.409" dur="3.9">will put them on edge you know let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1420.45" dur="3.359">let&amp;#39;s say let&amp;#39;s just call them the Cabal</text>
  <text start="1422.309" dur="2.671">for now it makes it easy I can use one</text>
  <text start="1423.809" dur="3.69">word and you know everybody&amp;#39;s familiar</text>
  <text start="1424.98" dur="5.159">with it so let&amp;#39;s just say basically our</text>
  <text start="1427.499" dur="3.481">goal is to set the Cabal in a panic so</text>
  <text start="1430.139" dur="2.52">that they&amp;#39;re running around like</text>
  <text start="1430.98" dur="3.269">chickens with their heads cut off and</text>
  <text start="1432.659" dur="3.12">not paying attention to what me and my</text>
  <text start="1434.249" dur="2.79">organization are doing and that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="1435.779" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;re going to start releasing our</text>
  <text start="1437.039" dur="4.291">software which is absolutely free by the</text>
  <text start="1439.109" dur="3.63">way I&amp;#39;m not making anyone pay for you</text>
  <text start="1441.33" dur="6.809">picked a great time to do that by the</text>
  <text start="1442.739" dur="7.29">way but you know actually I was I was</text>
  <text start="1448.139" dur="3.331">sitting with my hands you know under my</text>
  <text start="1450.029" dur="2.4">butt for a while and trying to figure</text>
  <text start="1451.47" dur="3.209">out how I was going to solve this</text>
  <text start="1452.429" dur="3.81">problem and the software just kind of</text>
  <text start="1454.679" dur="4.59">came to me like an epiphany and I was</text>
  <text start="1456.239" dur="4.38">like okay this could work and then you</text>
  <text start="1459.269" dur="3.63">know I started doing some reading</text>
  <text start="1460.619" dur="4.981">started doing some studying you know I</text>
  <text start="1462.899" dur="6.001">talked to some academics and come to</text>
  <text start="1465.6" dur="5.1">find out that it&amp;#39;s very viable and</text>
  <text start="1468.9" dur="3.96">there are people who have attempted to</text>
  <text start="1470.7" dur="5.4">do it before but not to the scale that</text>
  <text start="1472.86" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;m getting ready to do it on um but</text>
  <text start="1476.1" dur="3.42">that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s neither here nor</text>
  <text start="1477.63" dur="4.74">there but essentially the technology is</text>
  <text start="1479.52" dur="5.01">is the way I&amp;#39;m releasing it is very</text>
  <text start="1482.37" dur="3.93">clever because I can&amp;#39;t let it fall into</text>
  <text start="1484.53" dur="3.72">the wrong hands let me explain myself</text>
  <text start="1486.3" dur="9.21">just a little bit okay please</text>
  <text start="1488.25" dur="11.55">though let&amp;#39;s say I write a book and I</text>
  <text start="1495.51" dur="8.1">include the book so that no one can read</text>
  <text start="1499.8" dur="5.55">it now the contents of the book you know</text>
  <text start="1503.61" dur="3.15">even if you even if you can&amp;#39;t read it</text>
  <text start="1505.35" dur="4.11">just looking through it because of the</text>
  <text start="1506.76" dur="5.64">symbology kind of changes things in the</text>
  <text start="1509.46" dur="3.63">world it shows people something in sets</text>
  <text start="1512.4" dur="2.55">of precedent</text>
  <text start="1513.09" dur="5.67">you know the imagery and so on the</text>
  <text start="1514.95" dur="6.3">characters so those that are trying to</text>
  <text start="1518.76" dur="4.38">figure it out are going to have all</text>
  <text start="1521.25" dur="3.18">these high paid individuals that are</text>
  <text start="1523.14" dur="2.85">going to be picking through it and</text>
  <text start="1524.43" dur="3.78">trying to decipher it and figure it out</text>
  <text start="1525.99" dur="4.47">but of course their focuses on money</text>
  <text start="1528.21" dur="4.35">their focus is on getting paid their</text>
  <text start="1530.46" dur="5.25">focus isn&amp;#39;t on the curiosity and the</text>
  <text start="1532.56" dur="4.95">reason why the book was written so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1535.71" dur="4.53">not the software that I&amp;#39;m writing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1537.51" dur="4.35">how I&amp;#39;m writing it that&amp;#39;s important and</text>
  <text start="1540.24" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s taking me so long</text>
  <text start="1541.86" dur="5.09">because I have to be very careful in how</text>
  <text start="1543.51" dur="9.05">I mange Patrick not just what I&amp;#39;m making</text>
  <text start="1546.95" dur="8.08">so think about it like in the old days</text>
  <text start="1552.56" dur="3.61">there well actually that&amp;#39;s not very far</text>
  <text start="1555.03" dur="3.3">away from me there&amp;#39;s a place called</text>
  <text start="1556.17" dur="3.81">Bedford Virginia I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1558.33" dur="2.88">heard of the Beale cipher it&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="1559.98" dur="3.06">the most famous ciphers in the world</text>
  <text start="1561.21" dur="4.14">yeah that&amp;#39;s the one that&amp;#39;s uncrackable</text>
  <text start="1563.04" dur="4.47">ring supposedly yeah well they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1565.35" dur="3.57">actually got one guy he used the</text>
  <text start="1567.51" dur="2.67">Declaration of Independence and he</text>
  <text start="1568.92" dur="4.38">cracked one of the pages one of the</text>
  <text start="1570.18" dur="5.88">three pages and the other two have yet</text>
  <text start="1573.3" dur="5.15">been undeciphered and so nobody knows</text>
  <text start="1576.06" dur="5.28">exactly where the treasure is right and</text>
  <text start="1578.45" dur="4.6">they don&amp;#39;t know who the family is of the</text>
  <text start="1581.34" dur="3.51">posse that got lost when they when they</text>
  <text start="1583.05" dur="2.97">went out and come back so those are the</text>
  <text start="1584.85" dur="4.38">last two pages that haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="1586.02" dur="5.49">ciphered so in the same kind of way I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1589.23" dur="3.99">using a kind of insight Fuhrman so that</text>
  <text start="1591.51" dur="3.3">when I release the software it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1593.22" dur="3.75">to be free everybody can download it</text>
  <text start="1594.81" dur="3.9">everybody can use the software but they</text>
  <text start="1596.97" dur="5.67">won&amp;#39;t be able to just pick it apart and</text>
  <text start="1598.71" dur="5.49">figure out how it works at that</text>
  <text start="1602.64" dur="3.24">the first thing that comes to mind is</text>
  <text start="1604.2" dur="3.18">like just when these sort of things</text>
  <text start="1605.88" dur="3.21">happen it seems like everyone just</text>
  <text start="1607.38" dur="3.42">immediately or not immediately but</text>
  <text start="1609.09" dur="3.48">there&amp;#39;s a delay and then everyone is</text>
  <text start="1610.8" dur="4.17">suddenly started using the technology</text>
  <text start="1612.57" dur="3.6">like they crack the code eventually and</text>
  <text start="1614.97" dur="4.89">then it becomes weaponized and</text>
  <text start="1616.17" dur="5.1">controlled everything else but you just</text>
  <text start="1619.86" dur="3.87">so that we&amp;#39;re clear you&amp;#39;re not suicidal</text>
  <text start="1621.27" dur="3.72">right no not at all absolutely and if</text>
  <text start="1623.73" dur="2.61">you hear that I&amp;#39;m actually committing</text>
  <text start="1624.99" dur="2.97">suicide or something along those lines</text>
  <text start="1626.34" dur="3.99">then you should be extremely worried</text>
  <text start="1627.96" dur="4.59">okay this is all of my notes that</text>
  <text start="1630.33" dur="4.14">everything are here and that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="1632.55" dur="4.23">published my information online I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1634.47" dur="3.72">a reddit post with my white paper and so</text>
  <text start="1636.78" dur="3.99">on that talks about the basics of the</text>
  <text start="1638.19" dur="4.59">software and as time goes on I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="1640.77" dur="4.47">to add additional information for the</text>
  <text start="1642.78" dur="4.59">curious in case something happens to me</text>
  <text start="1645.24" dur="4.56">the flame of my work doesn&amp;#39;t doesn&amp;#39;t die</text>
  <text start="1647.37" dur="3.69">with me because that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s I mean if</text>
  <text start="1649.8" dur="2.73">you&amp;#39;re the only if you&amp;#39;re the bottleneck</text>
  <text start="1651.06" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re gonna take you out that if they</text>
  <text start="1652.53" dur="4.71">think this is legitimate yeah we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1655.83" dur="2.64">talking the way if you&amp;#39;re on my show</text>
  <text start="1657.24" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re going to be aware of you for</text>
  <text start="1658.47" dur="7.68">sure Oh fantastic great news okay you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1662.25" dur="4.98">brave man yeah so what the the name of</text>
  <text start="1666.15" dur="3.69">the software is actually really</text>
  <text start="1667.23" dur="6.21">interesting it&amp;#39;s called a hundred and</text>
  <text start="1669.84" dur="5.94">fifty million dollars exe and why I</text>
  <text start="1673.44" dur="6.24">named it that is because it makes all</text>
  <text start="1675.78" dur="4.95">hardware a factor of 10 more powerful</text>
  <text start="1679.68" dur="2.52">than it currently is and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1680.73" dur="4.02">dependent on the physical hardware</text>
  <text start="1682.2" dur="5.09">itself so some devices will be more</text>
  <text start="1684.75" dur="5.1">powerful than others because of specific</text>
  <text start="1687.29" dur="4.74">features that are in that hardware that</text>
  <text start="1689.85" dur="5.91">won&amp;#39;t be necessarily in another because</text>
  <text start="1692.03" dur="6.25">manufacturers of microchips they change</text>
  <text start="1695.76" dur="5.61">features often so the more you start</text>
  <text start="1698.28" dur="5.55">with the more you&amp;#39;ll gain in a way but</text>
  <text start="1701.37" dur="3.98">it&amp;#39;s designed so that you can&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="1703.83" dur="3.57">unlock the full features of the device</text>
  <text start="1705.35" dur="5.17">unless you network with other</text>
  <text start="1707.4" dur="5.01">individuals so like think about it like</text>
  <text start="1710.52" dur="4.89">I have I have two phones here they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1712.41" dur="4.86">both Samsung&amp;#39;s ones a galaxy s6 one of</text>
  <text start="1715.41" dur="4.2">them&amp;#39;s a knockoff it&amp;#39;s a cheap $50 phone</text>
  <text start="1717.27" dur="3.78">from Walmart so on the $50 phone won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1719.61" dur="3.48">be able to do much by itself but by</text>
  <text start="1721.05" dur="4.17">combining right if me and my friend have</text>
  <text start="1723.09" dur="5.31">one each with these devices by combining</text>
  <text start="1725.22" dur="5.19">our resources we can actually mine more</text>
  <text start="1728.4" dur="4.41">we can do more you know we can affect</text>
  <text start="1730.41" dur="4.05">more with the two devices sort of</text>
  <text start="1732.81" dur="3.729">working together like a node in the</text>
  <text start="1734.46" dur="4.059">supercomputer note mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1736.539" dur="5.22">okay so it&amp;#39;s going to make people want</text>
  <text start="1738.519" dur="5.49">to collaborate and of course people have</text>
  <text start="1741.759" dur="4.8">more devices than big corporations and</text>
  <text start="1744.009" dur="3.39">governments too it&amp;#39;s kind of like the</text>
  <text start="1746.559" dur="2.52">gun problem</text>
  <text start="1747.399" dur="3.48">you can&amp;#39;t take runs from the people</text>
  <text start="1749.079" dur="3.78">because we have too many of them or</text>
  <text start="1750.879" dur="4.77">Bitcoin even there you go</text>
  <text start="1752.859" dur="4.17">No so you know people will literally be</text>
  <text start="1755.649" dur="3.78">able to leverage the entire global</text>
  <text start="1757.029" dur="4.14">economy with this software and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1759.429" dur="2.97">be able to take it right back and it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1761.169" dur="4.05">go right into their hands to do it which</text>
  <text start="1762.399" dur="4.83">belongs by the way rightfully yeah I</text>
  <text start="1765.219" dur="4.77">mean I&amp;#39;m all about taking power from</text>
  <text start="1767.229" dur="4.59">these concentrations and giving it back</text>
  <text start="1769.989" dur="2.9">to people especially when I can when I</text>
  <text start="1771.819" dur="4.95">can show people I to do it themselves</text>
  <text start="1772.889" dur="6.46">decentralize it yeah so the the base</text>
  <text start="1776.769" dur="5.82">software is actually kind of like Dass</text>
  <text start="1779.349" dur="5.04">if you think about the old days of Gauss</text>
  <text start="1782.589" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s just a terminal it&amp;#39;s just a blank</text>
  <text start="1784.389" dur="3.96">screen with the little cursor on it and</text>
  <text start="1785.949" dur="4.62">you can use it to access the hardware</text>
  <text start="1788.349" dur="5.61">directly you can program and so on with</text>
  <text start="1790.569" dur="5.76">it but it&amp;#39;s manual everything is manual</text>
  <text start="1793.959" dur="4.43">input you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re basically giving</text>
  <text start="1796.329" dur="5.1">instructions directly to the computer</text>
  <text start="1798.389" dur="5.65">what we&amp;#39;re working on is an interface</text>
  <text start="1801.429" dur="4.41">which is a very very small it&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="1804.039" dur="3.09">megabytes to put it in perspective it</text>
  <text start="1805.839" dur="3.93">won&amp;#39;t quite fit on a three and a half</text>
  <text start="1807.129" dur="4.32">inch floppy but it&amp;#39;s very small and it</text>
  <text start="1809.769" dur="4.38">will be the operating system of the</text>
  <text start="1811.449" dur="3.81">future okay it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s designed to</text>
  <text start="1814.149" dur="2.67">interface with the terminal and that</text>
  <text start="1815.259" dur="4.74">will also be provided for free to the</text>
  <text start="1816.819" dur="6.15">general public so the whole point is</text>
  <text start="1819.999" dur="5.04">that the interface will be a browser OS</text>
  <text start="1822.969" dur="4.74">in other words just like opening Firefox</text>
  <text start="1825.039" dur="4.32">and windows normally when you open up</text>
  <text start="1827.709" dur="3.45">windows you&amp;#39;re already using roughly</text>
  <text start="1829.359" dur="3.36">one-third of your system&amp;#39;s resources</text>
  <text start="1831.159" dur="4.531">just to run your operating system and</text>
  <text start="1832.719" dur="4.5">then when you run the browser and other</text>
  <text start="1835.69" dur="2.639">things you know it starts to clog things</text>
  <text start="1837.219" dur="3.75">up and slow things down</text>
  <text start="1838.329" dur="4.71">yeah yeah so this is going to</text>
  <text start="1840.969" dur="3.27">revolutionize computing because you</text>
  <text start="1843.039" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t have to run an operating system</text>
  <text start="1844.239" dur="5.67">anymore you won&amp;#39;t have to run Linux you</text>
  <text start="1846.399" dur="5.34">won&amp;#39;t have to run Android you won&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1849.909" dur="3.27">to run iOS you can come you can decide</text>
  <text start="1851.739" dur="3.6">to if you want you can actually run</text>
  <text start="1853.179" dur="4.95">those systems from the terminal</text>
  <text start="1855.339" dur="4.32">interface and you can still do the same</text>
  <text start="1858.129" dur="2.76">things that you would normally but</text>
  <text start="1859.659" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;ll be run as a virtual machine</text>
  <text start="1860.889" dur="3.99">which means anybody that&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="1862.929" dur="4.17">infiltrate your device hack your device</text>
  <text start="1864.879" dur="3.78">or get in will only be accessing a</text>
  <text start="1867.099" dur="3.03">virtual machine in memory they won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1868.659" dur="1.711">accessing the device of the information</text>
  <text start="1870.129" dur="3.601">that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1870.37" dur="5.9">on like a VPN basically there you go all</text>
  <text start="1873.73" dur="4.26">built in that&amp;#39;s the way I designed it</text>
  <text start="1876.27" dur="3.97">okay Wow</text>
  <text start="1877.99" dur="3.569">blew the a9 that&amp;#39;s the whole point of</text>
  <text start="1880.24" dur="2.76">the software is I wanted something that</text>
  <text start="1881.559" dur="4.771">would give people their privacy back</text>
  <text start="1883" dur="4.559">I mean I&amp;#39;m I don&amp;#39;t follow all the</text>
  <text start="1886.33" dur="3.92">technicals of it but this is very</text>
  <text start="1887.559" dur="5.071">exciting I mean I&amp;#39;m highly intrigued</text>
  <text start="1890.25" dur="4.529">what do you do you have a time frame on</text>
  <text start="1892.63" dur="7.14">when you think you can get this out or</text>
  <text start="1894.779" dur="6.76">I&amp;#39;m looking at about 90 days so about 90</text>
  <text start="1899.77" dur="4.35">days from now if I can get it done</text>
  <text start="1901.539" dur="4.471">faster then you know I can get it done</text>
  <text start="1904.12" dur="4.35">faster giving me money isn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="1906.01" dur="4.32">make me do it any faster nothing really</text>
  <text start="1908.47" dur="4.26">is going to make me do it any faster</text>
  <text start="1910.33" dur="4.199">it&amp;#39;s I think I&amp;#39;m probably the only</text>
  <text start="1912.73" dur="3.809">person that can do it at this point and</text>
  <text start="1914.529" dur="3.63">so I just got to spend six hours a day</text>
  <text start="1916.539" dur="4.711">in front of a computer just punching</text>
  <text start="1918.159" dur="5.671">away I got caffeine if you need any of</text>
  <text start="1921.25" dur="5.01">that but well you know yeah yeah I get</text>
  <text start="1923.83" dur="5.069">plenty of that you know I sleep about 3</text>
  <text start="1926.26" dur="4.139">to 4 hours a night so and then you know</text>
  <text start="1928.899" dur="4.621">I&amp;#39;ve got I&amp;#39;ve got our family I&amp;#39;m raising</text>
  <text start="1930.399" dur="4.89">at the same time so it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1933.52" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s harrowing you know we&amp;#39;re in a very</text>
  <text start="1935.289" dur="4.561">rough time and that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1938.02" dur="4.35">motivation enough for me at this time</text>
  <text start="1939.85" dur="3.9">but when I&amp;#39;m not programming and I need</text>
  <text start="1942.37" dur="3.029">a break and I&amp;#39;ve got it you know this is</text>
  <text start="1943.75" dur="3.27">what I like to do because I like to tell</text>
  <text start="1945.399" dur="3.361">people and give people good news and let</text>
  <text start="1947.02" dur="3.149">them know that you know the world isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1948.76" dur="2.61">over there&amp;#39;s good people out there that</text>
  <text start="1950.169" dur="4.561">are still fighting that are still trying</text>
  <text start="1951.37" dur="5.159">to do good things you know even even</text>
  <text start="1954.73" dur="3.54">just a quick aside to that with all the</text>
  <text start="1956.529" dur="3.661">stuff going on with the cryptos and and</text>
  <text start="1958.27" dur="3.57">and at least the theory of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1960.19" dur="3.42">going to be capable of doing soon to</text>
  <text start="1961.84" dur="4.589">kind of free the money system I mean</text>
  <text start="1963.61" dur="5.069">that that is that is gonna in a way</text>
  <text start="1966.429" dur="4.5">shrink government&amp;#39;s 90% the inevitable</text>
  <text start="1968.679" dur="5.281">eventualities because governments can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1970.929" dur="4.801">stop it is that they will no longer be</text>
  <text start="1973.96" dur="3.449">able to survive on on their debt and</text>
  <text start="1975.73" dur="4.86">then possibly not even be able to tax</text>
  <text start="1977.409" dur="5.101">people at all so eventually we&amp;#39;ll get to</text>
  <text start="1980.59" dur="3.66">that state mess that&amp;#39;s you know this</text>
  <text start="1982.51" dur="2.97">this and all the stuff in politics and</text>
  <text start="1984.25" dur="2.96">everything else there there seems to be</text>
  <text start="1985.48" dur="4.799">a great awakening happening for sure</text>
  <text start="1987.21" dur="5.5">yeah most exciting time to ever I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="1990.279" dur="4.89">happy to be doing what I do and during</text>
  <text start="1992.71" dur="4.11">this time period it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very strange</text>
  <text start="1995.169" dur="3.75">to be alive I&amp;#39;ll tell you that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1996.82" dur="4.05">a strange time to be alive and be in the</text>
  <text start="1998.919" dur="5.021">world to be kind of at the center of a</text>
  <text start="2000.87" dur="4.96">lot of different things yeah well</text>
  <text start="2003.94" dur="4.199">I know we have people that may have some</text>
  <text start="2005.83" dur="3.479">questions and stuff but is there</text>
  <text start="2008.139" dur="2.4">anything else that you think we should</text>
  <text start="2009.309" dur="5.25">we missed or anything that we need to</text>
  <text start="2010.539" dur="6.331">cover and you know is are you taking the</text>
  <text start="2014.559" dur="5.011">right a lot of people probably don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2016.87" dur="5.519">understand about crypto what crypto is</text>
  <text start="2019.57" dur="3.929">and let me cover that real quick there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2022.389" dur="2.701">a lot of folks out there cuz there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2023.499" dur="7.17">lot of misinformation and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2025.09" dur="8.719">on purpose of course crypto is not a</text>
  <text start="2030.669" dur="7.62">fiat currency let me say that again</text>
  <text start="2033.809" dur="6">crypto is not a fiat currency and let me</text>
  <text start="2038.289" dur="3.661">explain why</text>
  <text start="2039.809" dur="3.041">what&amp;#39;s the building the Irian right now</text>
  <text start="2041.95" dur="3.66">what&amp;#39;s it made out of</text>
  <text start="2042.85" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;m just lumber and and you know</text>
  <text start="2045.61" dur="3.049">shingles and all the usual where&amp;#39;d that</text>
  <text start="2047.59" dur="4.499">come from</text>
  <text start="2048.659" dur="7.361">forests yeah but who required that</text>
  <text start="2052.089" dur="5.911">material I guess the you mean originally</text>
  <text start="2056.02" dur="4.559">or do you mean like the retail level you</text>
  <text start="2058" dur="5.51">see what I mean yeah so humans human</text>
  <text start="2060.579" dur="6.09">labor human action had to be used to</text>
  <text start="2063.51" dur="5.319">engineer we had to think we had to</text>
  <text start="2066.669" dur="3.031">understand how to cure that right then</text>
  <text start="2068.829" dur="2.641">we had to go get it</text>
  <text start="2069.7" dur="3.81">then we had to refine those materials</text>
  <text start="2071.47" dur="4.32">and then by the time that&amp;#39;s all finished</text>
  <text start="2073.51" dur="4.409">how much are we really getting for the</text>
  <text start="2075.79" dur="6.569">labor that we actually put into all that</text>
  <text start="2077.919" dur="6.571">I compare it to the cocaine trade that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2082.359" dur="3.451">what I compare it to because the the</text>
  <text start="2084.49" dur="3.839">people that are actually growing the</text>
  <text start="2085.81" dur="7.349">cocaine on the farms in Chile they get</text>
  <text start="2088.329" dur="6.931">probably about $4 US a day yeah and so</text>
  <text start="2093.159" dur="4.831">on the street you know cocaine a gram is</text>
  <text start="2095.26" dur="3.63">going anywhere from somewhere 65 to 120</text>
  <text start="2097.99" dur="3.78">dollars a gram</text>
  <text start="2098.89" dur="6.06">depending on where you get it right yeah</text>
  <text start="2101.77" dur="5.549">so there&amp;#39;s a and really the people that</text>
  <text start="2104.95" dur="4.56">are pushing it didn&amp;#39;t do anywhere near</text>
  <text start="2107.319" dur="3.661">the work that the poor people that</text>
  <text start="2109.51" dur="4.589">actually are getting paid for - they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2110.98" dur="6.45">making chump change mm-hmm so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2114.099" dur="4.681">what most of the debt based monetization</text>
  <text start="2117.43" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s actually makes the world go round</text>
  <text start="2118.78" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s how most of it works and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2121.18" dur="7.05">the reason why labor is so valueless is</text>
  <text start="2124.27" dur="6.21">because our our physical ability our</text>
  <text start="2128.23" dur="5.67">physical capability our actionable value</text>
  <text start="2130.48" dur="5.73">is based on debt inflation is showing</text>
  <text start="2133.9" dur="3.21">a.m. it&amp;#39;s more than just inflation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2136.21" dur="3.21">the taxation</text>
  <text start="2137.11" dur="3.84">on that same inflation yeah a double</text>
  <text start="2139.42" dur="2.97">whammy and it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s screwing the</text>
  <text start="2140.95" dur="3.12">people and the value that they create</text>
  <text start="2142.39" dur="3.51">out of that value correct and then</text>
  <text start="2144.07" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s a triple whammy of what&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="2145.9" dur="4.86">the fractional reserve policies at each</text>
  <text start="2148.42" dur="3.69">Bank so the bank&amp;#39;s never had any money</text>
  <text start="2150.76" dur="2.82">to loan anybody in the first place</text>
  <text start="2152.11" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s why you can actually see your way</text>
  <text start="2153.58" dur="4.56">out of a foreclosure because the bank</text>
  <text start="2156.04" dur="4.38">could never actually give you the loan</text>
  <text start="2158.14" dur="4.89">to own that property in the first place</text>
  <text start="2160.42" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;ve never had the money I&amp;#39;ve got an</text>
  <text start="2163.03" dur="3.09">interesting interview with Asaph coins</text>
  <text start="2164.62" dur="3.72">coming up when we&amp;#39;re gonna get into some</text>
  <text start="2166.12" dur="4.65">of that too that&amp;#39;s very good yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2168.34" dur="5.46">it back to crypto right so why crypto is</text>
  <text start="2170.77" dur="6">not fiat so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a guy right</text>
  <text start="2173.8" dur="5.61">and he&amp;#39;s shoveling sand into a sack and</text>
  <text start="2176.77" dur="4.23">he takes that sack down to his manager</text>
  <text start="2179.41" dur="3.81">and the manager puts it on a pallet with</text>
  <text start="2181" dur="4.35">the other sacks of sand and he sends it</text>
  <text start="2183.22" dur="4.8">off to the wholesaler and the whole</text>
  <text start="2185.35" dur="4.32">seller sells it to the refiner right and</text>
  <text start="2188.02" dur="3.96">the refiner takes all those taxes and</text>
  <text start="2189.67" dur="4.47">pours them into a big a big furnace and</text>
  <text start="2191.98" dur="4.5">then melts them down and finds them and</text>
  <text start="2194.14" dur="4.92">turns them into an ingot and then he</text>
  <text start="2196.48" dur="4.65">sells the ingot to a wholesaler on the</text>
  <text start="2199.06" dur="3.81">international market and then Intel AMD</text>
  <text start="2201.13" dur="4.2">right and so on so for these companies</text>
  <text start="2202.87" dur="4.19">buy them and then they turn them into</text>
  <text start="2205.33" dur="5.67">microchips into wafers</text>
  <text start="2207.06" dur="5.74">so everything that crypto actually is</text>
  <text start="2211" dur="5.55">representative of including the poor</text>
  <text start="2212.8" dur="5.4">Mook it&amp;#39;s getting behind a device</text>
  <text start="2216.55" dur="2.94">terminal right now watching the nuclear</text>
  <text start="2218.2" dur="3.3">power station to make sure it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2219.49" dur="3.78">going to melt down all of that energy</text>
  <text start="2221.5" dur="4.59">everything everything that culminates</text>
  <text start="2223.27" dur="9.36">into crypto is based in human actionable</text>
  <text start="2226.09" dur="11.37">value it is not fiat in fact it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2232.63" dur="7.5">opposite of BIA crypto is actually one</text>
  <text start="2237.46" dur="5.16">of the most valuable commodities in the</text>
  <text start="2240.13" dur="5.52">entire world because it&amp;#39;s based not just</text>
  <text start="2242.62" dur="7.95">on human value but on the energy it</text>
  <text start="2245.65" dur="7.32">takes to maintain that human life okay</text>
  <text start="2250.57" dur="5.49">that&amp;#39;s why crypto is so important to the</text>
  <text start="2252.97" dur="4.71">future well the problem with it right</text>
  <text start="2256.06" dur="3.33">now is something called scaling and</text>
  <text start="2257.68" dur="6.51">scaling is that basically it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2259.39" dur="6.51">software issue because we because of the</text>
  <text start="2264.19" dur="3.21">way that we use the internet because of</text>
  <text start="2265.9" dur="3.23">the way the IOT the Internet of Things</text>
  <text start="2267.4" dur="3.53">actually interacts with each other</text>
  <text start="2269.13" dur="3.479">there&amp;#39;s a bigger salut</text>
  <text start="2270.93" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s required and that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="2272.609" dur="3.181">reasons why the terminal is so important</text>
  <text start="2274.26" dur="3.5">because it kind of fixes a lot of those</text>
  <text start="2275.79" dur="4.38">issues at the base level</text>
  <text start="2277.76" dur="6.28">decentralization really is the solution</text>
  <text start="2280.17" dur="5.76">to all of those problems yeah I mean I</text>
  <text start="2284.04" dur="3.69">agree with you completely and I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="2285.93" dur="5.1">very excited about some of this third</text>
  <text start="2287.73" dur="6.3">third-generation stuff is happening you</text>
  <text start="2291.03" dur="5.91">know and I&amp;#39;m aware of the scaling issues</text>
  <text start="2294.03" dur="5.789">my daughters are all crazy I&amp;#39;m aware of</text>
  <text start="2296.94" dur="5.01">the scaling issue I kind of equated to</text>
  <text start="2299.819" dur="5.04">like the early days of like dialog and</text>
  <text start="2301.95" dur="5.22">you know that stuff you know it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="2304.859" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s a temporary issue and it&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="2307.17" dur="3.03">away very quickly in a blink of an eye</text>
  <text start="2308.849" dur="3.99">we&amp;#39;re gonna be we&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="2310.2" dur="4.32">conveniently using Kryptos like like</text>
  <text start="2312.839" dur="4.201">we&amp;#39;re using cell phones now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2314.52" dur="4.319">amazing this is this is the concern okay</text>
  <text start="2317.04" dur="4.049">this is my concern and it should be the</text>
  <text start="2318.839" dur="5.551">concern of pretty much every consumer in</text>
  <text start="2321.089" dur="6.53">the world what we don&amp;#39;t want okay is a</text>
  <text start="2324.39" dur="5.76">beast system centralized digital coming</text>
  <text start="2327.619" dur="5.891">well it&amp;#39;s more than that because you can</text>
  <text start="2330.15" dur="6.99">have a decentralized fee system and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2333.51" dur="4.829">just obfuscation we have the problem</text>
  <text start="2337.14" dur="3.959">with the 1% we&amp;#39;ve already talked about</text>
  <text start="2338.339" dur="3.99">the Cabal how basically everything runs</text>
  <text start="2341.099" dur="2.49">through them they basically control</text>
  <text start="2342.329" dur="2.341">everything that&amp;#39;s going on in the world</text>
  <text start="2343.589" dur="2.581">because they control all the world</text>
  <text start="2344.67" dur="3.689">banking powers they control the power</text>
  <text start="2346.17" dur="5.1">they control the value of our oil our</text>
  <text start="2348.359" dur="4.47">commodities our energy everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2351.27" dur="3.66">bought and sold they control the value</text>
  <text start="2352.829" dur="4.98">of farming you know they control</text>
  <text start="2354.93" dur="4.8">everything so the same thing can still</text>
  <text start="2357.809" dur="4.201">happen with the decentralized digital</text>
  <text start="2359.73" dur="5.639">currency but it will happen behind</text>
  <text start="2362.01" dur="5.16">closed curtain well outside of the scope</text>
  <text start="2365.369" dur="4.021">in the view of most of the general</text>
  <text start="2367.17" dur="4.74">public and that&amp;#39;s a really dangerous</text>
  <text start="2369.39" dur="4.11">thing how do you mean like how can they</text>
  <text start="2371.91" dur="3.03">use the decentralized system that way</text>
  <text start="2373.5" dur="4.619">I&amp;#39;m not disagreeing I&amp;#39;m just I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2374.94" dur="6">understand yeah okay so we&amp;#39;ve got let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2378.119" dur="5.25">say that 10% of the u.s. population is</text>
  <text start="2380.94" dur="4.679">famous in other words they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="2383.369" dur="3.24">Hollywood stars they&amp;#39;re congressmen</text>
  <text start="2385.619" dur="2.97">their house represented they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2386.609" dur="2.821">millionaires right they&amp;#39;re very power</text>
  <text start="2388.589" dur="4.201">are very powerful and very</text>
  <text start="2389.43" dur="4.619">well-connected though basically they are</text>
  <text start="2392.79" dur="3.15">afraid to lose everything they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="2394.049" dur="3.54">that means they&amp;#39;re very vulnerable and</text>
  <text start="2395.94" dur="3.899">they can be very very easily controlled</text>
  <text start="2397.589" dur="4.411">but they also have a very large amount</text>
  <text start="2399.839" dur="4.771">of the system&amp;#39;s resources so you can</text>
  <text start="2402" dur="5.73">have a decentralized systems and allow</text>
  <text start="2404.61" dur="4.65">individuals to be influencers on the</text>
  <text start="2407.73" dur="3.84">people that are underneath of them right</text>
  <text start="2409.26" dur="5.67">and it will appear to be decentralized</text>
  <text start="2411.57" dur="5.16">but still do much noting yep they will</text>
  <text start="2414.93" dur="3.18">be promoting these different altcoins</text>
  <text start="2416.73" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;ll be promoting these coins and</text>
  <text start="2418.11" dur="3.33">saying look this is a good thing and</text>
  <text start="2419.91" dur="4.17">getting them kind of reeled in like</text>
  <text start="2421.44" dur="4.68">fishing Bitcoin is having a lot of that</text>
  <text start="2424.08" dur="3.78">issue right now there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s as I</text>
  <text start="2426.12" dur="3.18">understand it and I know China had a</text>
  <text start="2427.86" dur="2.76">flood that wiped out like a lot of their</text>
  <text start="2429.3" dur="3.93">hash power but as I understand it the</text>
  <text start="2430.62" dur="3.9">big company it the top two companies if</text>
  <text start="2433.23" dur="4.47">they allied they can take over the whole</text>
  <text start="2434.52" dur="4.47">system correct and what I&amp;#39;m almost</text>
  <text start="2437.7" dur="4.11">certain that they are actually planning</text>
  <text start="2438.99" dur="5.07">on doing just that and where they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2441.81" dur="5.4">and I&amp;#39;ll tell you why they need Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="2444.06" dur="4.59">gone because it&amp;#39;s the power player let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2447.21" dur="3.24">say get rid of Bitcoin they can roll in</text>
  <text start="2448.65" dur="3.3">with whatever they want and then it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2450.45" dur="3.27">be the next big dog in the system and</text>
  <text start="2451.95" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s their real plan that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2453.72" dur="3.42">everybody needs to watch out for your</text>
  <text start="2455.19" dur="3.24">baby boomers are listening pay attention</text>
  <text start="2457.14" dur="3.18">because that&amp;#39;s exactly what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="2458.43" dur="3.78">yeah I don&amp;#39;t think bitcoins gonna be the</text>
  <text start="2460.32" dur="3.99">winner anyway I talk about it because</text>
  <text start="2462.21" dur="4.23">people they need to get that first step</text>
  <text start="2464.31" dur="4.02">mm-hmm and that&amp;#39;s the name look</text>
  <text start="2466.44" dur="3.6">recognize but I&amp;#39;m gonna be honest with</text>
  <text start="2468.33" dur="3.99">you I think that I think that we should</text>
  <text start="2470.04" dur="4.59">hold on to Bitcoin as long as we can and</text>
  <text start="2472.32" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s gonna need the support of the</text>
  <text start="2474.63" dur="3.66">general global populace because the</text>
  <text start="2476.49" dur="3.93">people that are behind it or not bad and</text>
  <text start="2478.29" dur="3.27">they don&amp;#39;t have bad intentions for the</text>
  <text start="2480.42" dur="4.59">system otherwise we would have seen that</text>
  <text start="2481.56" dur="5.64">already and if we allow them to kind of</text>
  <text start="2485.01" dur="4.47">take that from us what&amp;#39;s actually going</text>
  <text start="2487.2" dur="3.6">to happen is all the people that are in</text>
  <text start="2489.48" dur="2.7">it right now are going to drop out</text>
  <text start="2490.8" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re gonna find something else and</text>
  <text start="2492.18" dur="5.28">then we lose that whole support group to</text>
  <text start="2495.24" dur="3.66">all these other all claims and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2497.46" dur="4.77">kind of a problem you see what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2498.9" dur="4.98">saying now how it comes to you to give</text>
  <text start="2502.23" dur="3.66">people a little context here we know</text>
  <text start="2503.88" dur="3.93">about how the Cabal works and they use</text>
  <text start="2505.89" dur="3.69">every dirty trick in the book to force</text>
  <text start="2507.81" dur="4.47">people to do things and we know how</text>
  <text start="2509.58" dur="4.35">difficult it would be to resist that so</text>
  <text start="2512.28" dur="3.99">if they took out if they were to like</text>
  <text start="2513.93" dur="4.17">take these top two hash companies you</text>
  <text start="2516.27" dur="3.6">know that I&amp;#39;m sure that they have other</text>
  <text start="2518.1" dur="3.66">peoples mining power with them but they</text>
  <text start="2519.87" dur="3.87">control it if they were to take those</text>
  <text start="2521.76" dur="3.24">two top companies find the CEOs or</text>
  <text start="2523.74" dur="2.7">whatever the leaders and then take their</text>
  <text start="2525" dur="2.7">kids you know that&amp;#39;s just two</text>
  <text start="2526.44" dur="2.04">kidnappings and you&amp;#39;ve got all power</text>
  <text start="2527.7" dur="2.46">Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="2528.48" dur="3.09">well they don&amp;#39;t even have to do that</text>
  <text start="2530.16" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s the beauty of it they can just</text>
  <text start="2531.57" dur="3.51">basically give them you know open</text>
  <text start="2533.31" dur="3.84">threats and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not that difficult</text>
  <text start="2535.08" dur="3.539">to do I mean these people they work in</text>
  <text start="2537.15" dur="3.359">this system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2538.619" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s literally we&amp;#39;re already in the age</text>
  <text start="2540.509" dur="2.671">of the beast system because you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="2542.099" dur="2.73">anything but look at how many homeless</text>
  <text start="2543.18" dur="2.97">people we have you can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="2544.829" dur="2.371">without the dollar everybody&amp;#39;s depending</text>
  <text start="2546.15" dur="3.929">on the dollar the whole world is</text>
  <text start="2547.2" dur="4.649">actually and so once you collapse the</text>
  <text start="2550.079" dur="3.091">petrodollar which you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2551.849" dur="2.7">the real goal right now is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2553.17" dur="3.57">trying to collapse the petrodollar to</text>
  <text start="2554.549" dur="4.651">instigate a collapse in the economy so</text>
  <text start="2556.74" dur="3.839">they can restart the they&amp;#39;re gonna pull</text>
  <text start="2559.2" dur="3.329">a George Soros so they can buy up</text>
  <text start="2560.579" dur="2.94">everything on the US stock exchange for</text>
  <text start="2562.529" dur="2.371">pennies on the dollar and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2563.519" dur="3.09">do it with this new digital currency</text>
  <text start="2564.9" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s how they work they create a</text>
  <text start="2566.609" dur="3.42">problem and then they say oh look we</text>
  <text start="2568.41" dur="3.689">have the solution to this big problem</text>
  <text start="2570.029" dur="3.451">mm-hmm this is going to be but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2572.099" dur="2.46">not going to use one coin they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2573.48" dur="3.9">use a bunch of altcoins</text>
  <text start="2574.559" dur="4.44">get everybody involved right then then</text>
  <text start="2577.38" dur="2.939">they&amp;#39;ll just crash out the altcoins and</text>
  <text start="2578.999" dur="3.36">come up with this one global digital</text>
  <text start="2580.319" dur="3.121">currency that they control but it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2582.359" dur="3.601">look like a decentralized currency</text>
  <text start="2583.44" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;s my concern that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m in a</text>
  <text start="2585.96" dur="2.46">rush and trying to get this software out</text>
  <text start="2587.64" dur="4.199">as fast as I can</text>
  <text start="2588.42" dur="5.55">I I keep trying to brainstorm ways to to</text>
  <text start="2591.839" dur="4.891">create more widespread adoption and the</text>
  <text start="2593.97" dur="4.26">sticky factor and I&amp;#39;m hoping to me you</text>
  <text start="2596.73" dur="2.94">know I&amp;#39;ve kind of spoke to but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2598.23" dur="4.589">really hoping to interview and meet John</text>
  <text start="2599.67" dur="4.53">McAfee about this because he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2602.819" dur="4.2">foremost trying to push for that and</text>
  <text start="2604.2" dur="5.579">yeah would really like to brainstorm</text>
  <text start="2607.019" dur="5.161">some ideas with him yeah definitely well</text>
  <text start="2609.779" dur="4.52">he&amp;#39;s a pretty smart guy and you know he</text>
  <text start="2612.18" dur="4.589">went to college right around here and</text>
  <text start="2614.299" dur="4.06">he&amp;#39;s well aware of what&amp;#39;s going on but I</text>
  <text start="2616.769" dur="3.33">think he&amp;#39;s just as frayed as most of us</text>
  <text start="2618.359" dur="3.781">you know he knows that they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="2620.099" dur="3.9">they look they&amp;#39;re already trying to get</text>
  <text start="2622.14" dur="4.379">him extradited you know and put him in</text>
  <text start="2623.999" dur="5.37">prison cuz you know he&amp;#39;s well-connected</text>
  <text start="2626.519" dur="4.8">and he&amp;#39;s not going to buy he&amp;#39;s not going</text>

  <text start="2631.319" dur="3.96">absolutely he&amp;#39;ll take it he&amp;#39;ll die for</text>
  <text start="2632.91" dur="5.28">it but I hope that doesn&amp;#39;t happen yeah</text>
  <text start="2635.279" dur="6.601">that makes two of us we got any</text>
  <text start="2638.19" dur="6.99">questions uh well my only real question</text>
  <text start="2641.88" dur="4.859">you know is what can we do but you know</text>
  <text start="2645.18" dur="5.189">if we have if we have people who have</text>
  <text start="2646.739" dur="5.88">some questions we can go to those that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2650.369" dur="5.91">the biggest thing that we can do right</text>
  <text start="2652.619" dur="6.301">now is everybody everybody like us we</text>
  <text start="2656.279" dur="4.47">all need to be collaborating we need to</text>
  <text start="2658.92" dur="3.24">be getting on social media we need to be</text>
  <text start="2660.749" dur="3.36">influencers we need to be doing what</text>
  <text start="2662.16" dur="3.149">we&amp;#39;re doing right now those networks are</text>

  <text start="2785.4" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a very good reason why</text>
  <text start="2788.31" dur="3.02">he&amp;#39;s being successful and it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="2789.87" dur="5.54">he&amp;#39;s not playing the same game that</text>
  <text start="2791.33" dur="6.25">every other president has been playing</text>
  <text start="2795.41" dur="4.45">he&amp;#39;s not playing with the same rules</text>
  <text start="2797.58" dur="3.96">he&amp;#39;s not playing on the same board he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2799.86" dur="3.9">not using the same pieces well for the</text>
  <text start="2801.54" dur="3.06">most part anyway I mean you know there</text>
  <text start="2803.76" dur="2.61">are some things that are just completely</text>
  <text start="2804.6" dur="5.25">unavoidable</text>
  <text start="2806.37" dur="5.19">okay um well do you have anybody on your</text>
  <text start="2809.85" dur="3.5">Ian that&amp;#39;s asking questions that we want</text>
  <text start="2811.56" dur="6.33">to get through no not really</text>
  <text start="2813.35" dur="7.03">okay so I&amp;#39;m my brain is just in full</text>
  <text start="2817.89" dur="4.44">mode right now I don&amp;#39;t even okay I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2820.38" dur="3.51">even gonna pretend to Eva you know I can</text>
  <text start="2822.33" dur="5.52">I can maybe solve a computer virus</text>
  <text start="2823.89" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s about it so but at the same point</text>
  <text start="2827.85" dur="4.8">this is this is this is interesting this</text>
  <text start="2829.95" dur="4.14">is exciting this is I don&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="2832.65" dur="3.33">help you to get it out there I think</text>
  <text start="2834.09" dur="3.54">that probably the best way is to ride</text>
  <text start="2835.98" dur="4.14">the excitement of the crypto in general</text>
  <text start="2837.63" dur="5.25">and then also throw on everything else</text>
  <text start="2840.12" dur="5.13">that you can do with this stuff faster</text>
  <text start="2842.88" dur="3.3">than light travel I mean that people are</text>
  <text start="2845.25" dur="1.71">just gonna look at that and not even</text>
  <text start="2846.18" dur="5.19">believe it at first</text>
  <text start="2846.96" dur="6.15">so really you know fast in my travels</text>
  <text start="2851.37" dur="3.48">fascinating I would like for to see our</text>
  <text start="2853.11" dur="3.36">species out in the in the stars and</text>
  <text start="2854.85" dur="3.51">stuff and exploring space and you know</text>
  <text start="2856.47" dur="3.09">acquiring resources setting up colonies</text>
  <text start="2858.36" dur="3.15">and stuff because that would keep us</text>
  <text start="2859.56" dur="4.35">alive if in case the planets ever wiped</text>
  <text start="2861.51" dur="4.05">out anyway but like for me personally I</text>
  <text start="2863.91" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;m just a farmer I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="2865.56" dur="3.47">particularly care about going into space</text>
  <text start="2867.03" dur="4.26">or faster than light travel you know i</text>
  <text start="2869.03" dur="3.55">I&amp;#39;ve seen too many space movies where</text>
  <text start="2871.29" dur="3">they end up stranded in space with</text>
  <text start="2872.58" dur="3.54">aliens and they&amp;#39;re like barely enough</text>
  <text start="2874.29" dur="3.6">oxygen and stuff I don&amp;#39;t want any of</text>
  <text start="2876.12" dur="3.09">that but you know some of the other</text>
  <text start="2877.89" dur="3.06">stuff that you&amp;#39;re talking about doing</text>
  <text start="2879.21" dur="3.33">like protecting computers from all of</text>
  <text start="2880.95" dur="4.53">these you know from any sort of a 0 to</text>
  <text start="2882.54" dur="4.59">exploit or or or taking advantage of</text>
  <text start="2885.48" dur="4.32">some of this stuff to maximize our</text>
  <text start="2887.13" dur="4.83">energy flow or or two to help Kryptos</text>
  <text start="2889.8" dur="3.84">expand or to create free speech options</text>
  <text start="2891.96" dur="3.75">I mean anything like let&amp;#39;s get this</text>
  <text start="2893.64" dur="4.65">going you know yeah just I&amp;#39;m just want</text>
  <text start="2895.71" dur="5.64">to support you know the global economy</text>
  <text start="2898.29" dur="5.46">has to grow but it can&amp;#39;t have inflation</text>
  <text start="2901.35" dur="5.51">and that&amp;#39;s the key with crypto that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2903.75" dur="5.73">what we&amp;#39;re working on the solution for</text>
  <text start="2906.86" dur="4.83">deflation earring survey yeah what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2909.48" dur="5.34">working on is something called your coin</text>
  <text start="2911.69" dur="5.83">and it&amp;#39;s the we consider probably the</text>
  <text start="2914.82" dur="7.05">future of them all crypto because our</text>
  <text start="2917.52" dur="7.23">goal is midterm in ten years our goal is</text>
  <text start="2921.87" dur="5.75">to basically have earth in a situation</text>
  <text start="2924.75" dur="6.5">called a type one civilization yeah</text>
  <text start="2927.62" dur="6.4">where we are energy independent yeah</text>
  <text start="2931.25" dur="4.75">yeah it essentially means that farmers</text>
  <text start="2934.02" dur="4.11">like you on you&amp;#39;ll be producing your own</text>
  <text start="2936" dur="4.26">energy on you&amp;#39;ll be energy independent</text>
  <text start="2938.13" dur="3.78">and every</text>
  <text start="2940.26" dur="3.45">in the economy of the future is</text>
  <text start="2941.91" dur="4.14">dependent on energy you think about it</text>
  <text start="2943.71" dur="4.5">I want gold well okay I have to I have</text>
  <text start="2946.05" dur="4.23">to grow food well if I want to grow food</text>
  <text start="2948.21" dur="3.54">I have to have healthy soil if I want to</text>
  <text start="2950.28" dur="3.51">have healthy soil I need energy I need</text>
  <text start="2951.75" dur="4.95">robots I need someone to actually do all</text>
  <text start="2953.79" dur="4.17">that for me right mm-hm and so forth so</text>
  <text start="2956.7" dur="4.32">everything is going to be based on</text>
  <text start="2957.96" dur="5.58">energy and energy production so mid-term</text>
  <text start="2961.02" dur="5.49">around the ten year mark your coin is</text>
  <text start="2963.54" dur="7.23">going to be the center of a global</text>
  <text start="2966.51" dur="7.77">public energy based exchange so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2970.77" dur="5.49">say Kenya they start to you know to get</text>
  <text start="2974.28" dur="4.2">some of their people educated and some</text>
  <text start="2976.26" dur="4.59">kid comes up with this new novel form of</text>
  <text start="2978.48" dur="3.9">energy production it&amp;#39;s currently the</text>
  <text start="2980.85" dur="4.32">cheapest form of energy production in</text>
  <text start="2982.38" dur="3.93">the world and it works in Kenya but it</text>
  <text start="2985.17" dur="2.79">won&amp;#39;t really work anywhere else because</text>
  <text start="2986.31" dur="3.9">they have a unique situation there or</text>
  <text start="2987.96" dur="3.96">whatever it is what have you so now</text>
  <text start="2990.21" dur="3.27">energy becomes our I&amp;#39;m sorry now Kenya</text>
  <text start="2991.92" dur="3.96">becomes a global leader in the market</text>
  <text start="2993.48" dur="5.43">and so everybody&amp;#39;s economy kind of</text>
  <text start="2995.88" dur="4.98">bounces off of theirs you see so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2998.91" dur="3.72">the idea behind your coin because it</text>
  <text start="3000.86" dur="3.81">will allow us to expand the global</text>
  <text start="3002.63" dur="5.43">economy without creating a deflation</text>
  <text start="3004.67" dur="4.71">Ettore system okay so if you think about</text>
  <text start="3008.06" dur="3.3">it there are people that talk about a</text>
  <text start="3009.38" dur="3.53">resource-based economy this is very</text>
  <text start="3011.36" dur="2.67">similar to a resource-based economic</text>
  <text start="3012.91" dur="4.63">idea</text>
  <text start="3014.03" dur="5.85">III love those people I got my first red</text>
  <text start="3017.54" dur="4.5">pill from the zeitgeist thing but you</text>
  <text start="3019.88" dur="5.13">know at the same point I have to be like</text>
  <text start="3022.04" dur="5.06">well while we still have money that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3025.01" dur="4.26">sort of like Tommy anism of the robots</text>
  <text start="3027.1" dur="5.89">yeah what would your answer be for that</text>
  <text start="3029.27" dur="5.85">the the problem is that once we already</text>
  <text start="3032.99" dur="2.58">have the taste of robotis ism in our</text>
  <text start="3035.12" dur="3.48">mouths</text>
  <text start="3035.57" dur="5.49">we&amp;#39;ve got Roombas we&amp;#39;ve got automatic</text>
  <text start="3038.6" dur="6.12">driving cars it&amp;#39;s not going away buddy</text>
  <text start="3041.06" dur="5.79">mmm the Amish there they might not adopt</text>
  <text start="3044.72" dur="4.08">that stuff but you know it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="3046.85" dur="3.39">to affect them they have already they</text>
  <text start="3048.8" dur="2.79">just cheat they just put a telephone at</text>
  <text start="3050.24" dur="4.17">the end of their driveway you see what I</text>
  <text start="3051.59" dur="4.95">mean yeah so it&amp;#39;s the same thing is</text>
  <text start="3054.41" dur="3.9">going to happen except this is the</text>
  <text start="3056.54" dur="2.61">reason why it&amp;#39;s so important that we get</text>
  <text start="3058.31" dur="3.26">a movement going</text>
  <text start="3059.15" dur="5.34">because societies are going to change</text>
  <text start="3061.57" dur="5.17">towns are going to change cities are</text>
  <text start="3064.49" dur="4.5">going to change and the people have to</text>
  <text start="3066.74" dur="5.37">have the financial freedom to be able to</text>
  <text start="3068.99" dur="4.56">live a lifestyle that they want and the</text>
  <text start="3072.11" dur="2.67">current system that we have is not going</text>
  <text start="3073.55" dur="2.78">to allow them to do</text>
  <text start="3074.78" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s not going to facilitate that</text>
  <text start="3076.33" dur="4.87">robotics is coming Automation is coming</text>
  <text start="3079.07" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s no way around it you can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="3081.2" dur="2.61">say we&amp;#39;re not going because people are</text>
  <text start="3082.76" dur="3">just going to do it anyway</text>
  <text start="3083.81" dur="3.42">I love the technological aspect of</text>
  <text start="3085.76" dur="3.42">everything in the Venus Project in</text>
  <text start="3087.23" dur="3.66">zeitgeist it&amp;#39;s that centralized control</text>
  <text start="3089.18" dur="4.56">of the resource distribution that</text>
  <text start="3090.89" dur="5.73">bothered me let me ask you a question</text>
  <text start="3093.74" dur="5.73">right so we have we have an automated</text>
  <text start="3096.62" dur="5.28">traffic service in in our cities hmm and</text>
  <text start="3099.47" dur="3.9">it does work right so that for the most</text>
  <text start="3101.9" dur="3.63">part you know there are they&amp;#39;re idiots</text>
  <text start="3103.37" dur="3.63">that defy the laws and of course that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3105.53" dur="3.42">what causes the problems and there are</text>
  <text start="3107" dur="4.95">some technical issues that are that are</text>
  <text start="3108.95" dur="5.07">part of that right so can you since</text>
  <text start="3111.95" dur="3.81">since you say well I trust these systems</text>
  <text start="3114.02" dur="3.21">generally speaking yeah you would trust</text>
  <text start="3115.76" dur="3.81">one of those systems more than you would</text>
  <text start="3117.23" dur="4.68">trust a politician yeah oh yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="3119.57" dur="6.36">it so what is so scary about saying</text>
  <text start="3121.91" dur="7.02">letting a computer software okay</text>
  <text start="3125.93" dur="5.04">manage financial resource systems if it</text>
  <text start="3128.93" dur="5.16">were if it were like a you know an open</text>
  <text start="3130.97" dur="4.89">source and everyone can can read it</text>
  <text start="3134.09" dur="3.33">decentralized kind of thing then that</text>
  <text start="3135.86" dur="3.51">would be very interesting to me and that</text>
  <text start="3137.42" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m working on it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3139.37" dur="3.99">difficult because not everybody is going</text>
  <text start="3141.08" dur="4.26">to want to buy in and so we have to make</text>
  <text start="3143.36" dur="4.44">room for people for that the same way</text>
  <text start="3145.34" dur="4.11">that the Amish have a way to live - and</text>
  <text start="3147.8" dur="3.57">so that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s to me that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3149.45" dur="4.62">the most important part about the future</text>
  <text start="3151.37" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s difficult for a lot of people to</text>
  <text start="3154.07" dur="5.52">conceptualize because now everybody</text>
  <text start="3157.04" dur="4.47">wants this and I&amp;#39;m not god I don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="3159.59" dur="3.84">to decide who gets to live the way they</text>
  <text start="3161.51" dur="4.52">want to you know I want everybody to be</text>
  <text start="3163.43" dur="4.77">able to live free and have liberty and</text>

  <text start="3369.6" dur="5.61">your first year like laid out okay so</text>
  <text start="3372.72" dur="4.11">what we&amp;#39;re going to do I work with the</text>
  <text start="3375.21" dur="3.21">organization that&amp;#39;s a think-tank it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3376.83" dur="3.87">global think tank we have an app that we</text>
  <text start="3378.42" dur="4.02">just finished developing it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="3380.7" dur="4.26">be an ongoing development because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3382.44" dur="4.47">taking user input so that we can find</text>
  <text start="3384.96" dur="4.92">you know basically fine-tune the app and</text>
  <text start="3386.91" dur="6.6">give users what they need but the goal</text>
  <text start="3389.88" dur="6.09">is that by 2021 we will be releasing a</text>
  <text start="3393.51" dur="6">global publicly owned internet service</text>
  <text start="3395.97" dur="6.63">provider that&amp;#39;s our goal from starting</text>
  <text start="3399.51" dur="5.4">from February next year until November</text>
  <text start="3402.6" dur="3.6">2020 in November 2020 is important</text>
  <text start="3404.91" dur="4.92">market only calendar because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3406.2" dur="6.6">presidential election but it&amp;#39;s also when</text>
  <text start="3409.83" dur="6.54">our organization is planning organizing</text>
  <text start="3412.8" dur="5.85">a global labor strike okay I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="3416.37" dur="3.6">serious about it because basically what</text>
  <text start="3418.65" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re gonna do is we&amp;#39;re going to allow</text>
  <text start="3419.97" dur="4.11">the people to make demands of their</text>
  <text start="3422.07" dur="3.93">governments because the app lets them</text>
  <text start="3424.08" dur="3.72">have free speech it&amp;#39;s like a voting</text>
  <text start="3426" dur="5.04">system it will allow people to</text>
  <text start="3427.8" dur="4.92">collaborate and work together and even</text>
  <text start="3431.04" dur="3.54">talk with people that aren&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="3432.72" dur="4.11">of their own nation or nation-states</text>
  <text start="3434.58" dur="4.11">and create their own societies etc it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3436.83" dur="4.14">gonna be really great having a fair and</text>
  <text start="3438.69" dur="3.84">honest and an open-source polling thing</text>
  <text start="3440.97" dur="5.1">would just be useful in and of itself</text>
  <text start="3442.53" dur="6.48">that&amp;#39;s the idea behind yet yeah but okay</text>
  <text start="3446.07" dur="4.8">so when you say ISP like you mean</text>
  <text start="3449.01" dur="3.87">something new that&amp;#39;s gonna replace the</text>
  <text start="3450.87" dur="5.46">traditional Internet service provider</text>
  <text start="3452.88" dur="7.2">yes he&amp;#39;s not because everything there</text>
  <text start="3456.33" dur="5.1">are three major players in the world and</text>
  <text start="3460.08" dur="2.67">there are three made they&amp;#39;re really the</text>
  <text start="3461.43" dur="3.33">same company they&amp;#39;re all wound by the</text>
  <text start="3462.75" dur="5.57">same banks and same people but there are</text>
  <text start="3464.76" dur="5.58">three major telecommunications</text>
  <text start="3468.32" dur="5.14">organizations in the world there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="3470.34" dur="5.76">three and they own and run every ISP and</text>
  <text start="3473.46" dur="4.23">so you know Clear Channel Communications</text>
  <text start="3476.1" dur="3.36">for example they&amp;#39;re like oh look you</text>
  <text start="3477.69" dur="3.45">know we own and we own this we own</text>
  <text start="3479.46" dur="2.91">that well you know that&amp;#39;s great but</text>
  <text start="3481.14" dur="2.52">they&amp;#39;re all the same they&amp;#39;re all just</text>
  <text start="3482.37" dur="3.48">kind of washed into the same thing what</text>
  <text start="3483.66" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re gonna do is we&amp;#39;re gonna allow the</text>
  <text start="3485.85" dur="4.89">public to decide openly and say do they</text>
  <text start="3488.91" dur="4.23">want their own Internet service provider</text>
  <text start="3490.74" dur="5.04">which will be a publicly owned company</text>
  <text start="3493.14" dur="6.24">a corporation so it&amp;#39;ll be like a trust</text>
  <text start="3495.78" dur="6.06">that will be run in the same way that a</text>
  <text start="3499.38" dur="5.22">credit union is run its phoned by the</text>
  <text start="3501.84" dur="4.89">people that actually have an account so</text>
  <text start="3504.6" dur="3.66">people will pay like a nominal fee like</text>
  <text start="3506.73" dur="3.18">a dollar ninety-nine for their service</text>
  <text start="3508.26" dur="3.21">but that&amp;#39;s just to make the computers</text>
  <text start="3509.91" dur="3.99">and the systems that make everything</text>
  <text start="3511.47" dur="4.47">work and work together that&amp;#39;s just to</text>
  <text start="3513.9" dur="4.5">make it all run we&amp;#39;re not making any</text>
  <text start="3515.94" dur="4.47">profit off of this it&amp;#39;ll actually run</text>
  <text start="3518.4" dur="4.47">off of what&amp;#39;s called a bankroll which</text>
  <text start="3520.41" dur="4.62">runs all encrypt up and that goes to our</text>
  <text start="3522.87" dur="4.89">insurance company and it&amp;#39;ll also be</text>
  <text start="3525.03" dur="5.37">publicly owned and the credit union</text>
  <text start="3527.76" dur="4.74">which will also be publicly owned now</text>
  <text start="3530.4" dur="4.23">how do you prevent those people who run</text>
  <text start="3532.5" dur="4.44">it from having too much power yeah so</text>
  <text start="3534.63" dur="5.22">there&amp;#39;s five there&amp;#39;s five people in each</text>
  <text start="3536.94" dur="5.67">trust and the insurance company is a</text>
  <text start="3539.85" dur="5.61">guild and the guild is nothing more than</text>
  <text start="3542.61" dur="5.1">a group of trusts so people are going to</text>
  <text start="3545.46" dur="4.05">start coming forward as they become more</text>
  <text start="3547.71" dur="3.99">wealthy and so on and they start their</text>
  <text start="3549.51" dur="3.51">own companies so they&amp;#39;re going to want</text>
  <text start="3551.7" dur="3.03">to become a part of a guild an</text>
  <text start="3553.02" dur="2.88">organization that kind of works towards</text>
  <text start="3554.73" dur="3.6">their same goals and that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="3555.9" dur="4.47">lighthouse is all about is we&amp;#39;re like a</text>
  <text start="3558.33" dur="4.74">gilt your thing a collection of Trust&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3560.37" dur="4.53">so then you if you know if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3563.07" dur="3.36">have those goals in mind you&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="3567.69" dur="4.02">for the people that you&amp;#39;re not or these</text>
  <text start="3569.19" dur="4.29">same goals and so your trust isn&amp;#39;t going</text>
