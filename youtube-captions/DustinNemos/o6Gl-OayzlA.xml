  <text start="63.989" dur="4.021">life with soma Bluetooth on video this</text>

  <text start="73.83" dur="4.35">things check out the more cola calm</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="4.379">detox protocol before you do it because</text>
  <text start="78.18" dur="4.799">you can detox too much mercury at a time</text>
  <text start="80.189" dur="4.29">you can get really sick okay but even</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="3.75">though it&amp;#39;s not quite as strong as that</text>
  <text start="84.479" dur="3.96">as the professionally made a liposomal</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="3.511">glutathione this stuff is so much</text>
  <text start="88.439" dur="4.5">cheaper that you can take a lot more of</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="4.379">it for less so as you can see I make it</text>
  <text start="92.939" dur="4.441">by the bottle instead of by the the</text>
  <text start="94.619" dur="4.441">dropper vial I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="3.66">microgreens but before I get into that</text>
  <text start="99.06" dur="4.29">check this stuff out here I&amp;#39;m gonna call</text>
  <text start="101.04" dur="4.74">it Nemo&amp;#39;s blend this is a tea it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="4.89">green team which just the regular store</text>
  <text start="105.78" dur="5.01">stuff I can improve there but it also</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="5.129">has nettle comfrey and red raspberry tea</text>
  <text start="110.79" dur="4.619">in it this stuff is amazing and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="5.82">only thing I bought was the Green Team</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="6.151">and yeah I could probably buy that in a</text>
  <text start="119.189" dur="3.72">bulk form as well so that would be</text>
  <text start="121.56" dur="4.11">pretty cool I&amp;#39;ve got all of this other</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="5.641">stuff is just growing wild and that has</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="5.069">some amazing health stuff you know no</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="3.78">claims or no anything like that but I</text>
  <text start="130.739" dur="4.121">have</text>
  <text start="132.33" dur="5.17">comfrey is also known as a bone it</text>
  <text start="134.86" dur="4.89">because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s known to help heal</text>
  <text start="137.5" dur="4.38">bones it&amp;#39;s actually a strong healing</text>
  <text start="139.75" dur="5.25">plant people even use it as an external</text>
  <text start="141.88" dur="5.16">application so it&amp;#39;s actually a weed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145" dur="4.02">a very interesting fascinating weed I</text>
  <text start="147.04" dur="3.75">first learned about this stuff when I</text>
  <text start="149.02" dur="4.44">used to raise chickens right when I had</text>
  <text start="150.79" dur="5.37">I told you guys before when I was like</text>
  <text start="153.46" dur="4.44">16 17 years old I found out about all</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="3.12">the GMO and the poison and the</text>
  <text start="157.9" dur="3.21">pesticides and everything else and I was</text>
  <text start="159.28" dur="2.76">like family we&amp;#39;re gonna get some</text>
  <text start="161.11" dur="2.67">chickens we&amp;#39;re gonna start a garden</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re gonna eat healthy now it turns out</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="3.59">none of them were interested in that my</text>
  <text start="165.91" dur="3.87">grandfather and I just had a couple</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="4.54">years of fun together building chicken</text>
  <text start="169.78" dur="4.07">coops and experimenting with animals and</text>
  <text start="171.91" dur="4.32">stuff you know that sounds bad</text>
  <text start="173.85" dur="3.88">experimenting with having animals in the</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="4.44">backyard that kind of thing not</text>
  <text start="177.73" dur="4.8">experimenting with animals but we had a</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="3.48">great time and I learned a lot and I</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="4.62">found out about comfrey which is kind of</text>
  <text start="184.15" dur="5.13">a natural weed because it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="187.15" dur="4.05">chicken feed so you can grow it like all</text>
  <text start="189.28" dur="4.62">on the perimeter of your chicken coop</text>
  <text start="191.2" dur="3.98">and or your fence and then they can just</text>
  <text start="193.9" dur="3.03">kind of stick their heads to and eat it</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="3.309">interesting thing it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="196.93" dur="3.45">synergistic plant with other things like</text>
  <text start="198.489" dur="5.071">apple trees you can plant this next to a</text>
  <text start="200.38" dur="5.19">tree and the roots of the comfrey can go</text>
  <text start="203.56" dur="4.56">I think it&amp;#39;s 50 feet deep into the soil</text>
  <text start="205.57" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s rare and that pulls nutrition up</text>
  <text start="208.12" dur="3.66">from the from the deeper soil all those</text>
  <text start="210.25" dur="2.73">minerals and goodies that are way down</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="3.3">in there in the clay and then the</text>
  <text start="212.98" dur="4.289">bedrock and such it will go down in</text>
  <text start="215.08" dur="4.379">there with its roots pull them up with</text>
  <text start="217.269" dur="4.861">its growth and then die and deposit all</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="4.891">of that right there at the tree or to</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="5.43">the chickens or just however you want to</text>
  <text start="224.35" dur="4.41">do it it&amp;#39;s a weed it&amp;#39;ll spread you know</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="2.7">but if you&amp;#39;re using it for something</text>
  <text start="228.76" dur="3.66">like that then you want as much as you</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="4.08">can get anyway right you can just throw</text>
  <text start="232.42" dur="3.539">it to the chickens by the by the large</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="4.32">quantities you can make teas out of it</text>
  <text start="235.959" dur="5.071">things like that I&amp;#39;ve considered selling</text>
  <text start="238.66" dur="4.049">it as a as a tea but or the nettle</text>
  <text start="241.03" dur="3.63">nettles also quite good</text>
  <text start="242.709" dur="3.181">or the red raspberry leaf but there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="244.66" dur="2.37">much work involved in actually</text>
  <text start="245.89" dur="2.34">harvesting and then drying and</text>
  <text start="247.03" dur="2.28">everything it may not be worth it I</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="3.74">don&amp;#39;t know you guys let me know what you</text>
  <text start="249.31" dur="4.95">think but I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="6.13">microgreens okay this this video is</text>
  <text start="254.26" dur="5.49">really about microgreens some people you</text>
  <text start="258.1" dur="3.93">see the little little things you can buy</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="3.96">and stack you see the little machines</text>
  <text start="262.03" dur="3.66">that can do it for you some people do</text>
  <text start="263.71" dur="2.49">the mason jar method where they just</text>
  <text start="265.69" dur="2.4">rinse it out</text>
  <text start="266.2" dur="3.09">turn it upside down and let it drain to</text>
  <text start="268.09" dur="4.2">a couple times a day and that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="269.29" dur="6.27">simple but when I do these things I</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="5.34">don&amp;#39;t do them for I don&amp;#39;t do them for a</text>
  <text start="275.56" dur="3.93">little bit right it&amp;#39;s about the same</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="4.68">amount of work to go big all right</text>
  <text start="279.49" dur="4.98">and I am adapting what I learned from a</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="5.24">fodder system which is basically a</text>
  <text start="284.47" dur="6">gigantic grow system based on a shelf</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="5.35">designed to grow like barley or wheat</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="5.31">grass for for animals fodder system is</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="4.86">like animal feed so you know in winter I</text>
  <text start="295.78" dur="4.23">can grow a whole shelf full of barley</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="4.92">save money on rabbit feed not have to go</text>
  <text start="300.01" dur="4.68">buy those big bags save time and the</text>
  <text start="302.68" dur="5.04">rabbits love it it&amp;#39;s fresh green living</text>
  <text start="304.69" dur="5.94">food rather than drive pellets it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.72" dur="4.71">like I said it&amp;#39;s a huge savings cost and</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="3.6">basically you can you can feed that to</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="3.21">most farm animals pigs will just go</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="2.55">through it too fast they love it but</text>
  <text start="315.64" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ll go through it too fast it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="316.78" dur="4.8">good treat but you know these are</text>
  <text start="319.69" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re great to have around they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="321.58" dur="3.54">beautiful they help clean the air like</text>
  <text start="323.56" dur="4.08">plants do you know you there&amp;#39;s all those</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="4.44">benefits but imagine taking a fodder</text>
  <text start="327.64" dur="2.97">system which is you know the Shelf unit</text>
  <text start="329.56" dur="4.53">like that&amp;#39;s what I do with my</text>
  <text start="330.61" dur="6.48">microgreens and then combining that with</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="6.06">the power of nutrient-dense microgreens</text>
  <text start="337.09" dur="6.27">40 times this is 40 times more nutrition</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="5.13">in in concentration form in the micro</text>
  <text start="343.36" dur="3.69">green plant then you would have in a</text>
  <text start="345.28" dur="3.81">full grown plant this is this one is</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="4.38">watercress this is one I like to use for</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="4.8">a multivitamin this is my multivitamin</text>
  <text start="351.43" dur="4.05">and it&amp;#39;s a little spicy so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="353.89" dur="3.18">actually like to eat it raw too much I</text>
  <text start="355.48" dur="3.78">can do like a couple at a time but</text>
  <text start="357.07" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s about it it&amp;#39;s as spicy as mustard</text>
  <text start="359.26" dur="5.52">is like mustard seed but it&amp;#39;s incredibly</text>
  <text start="363.19" dur="4.47">healthy it&amp;#39;s incredibly easy to grow</text>
  <text start="364.78" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s so simple and I&amp;#39;ve got like</text>
  <text start="367.66" dur="5.01">six of these trays okay growing just</text>
  <text start="370.54" dur="4.86">this one plant and it&amp;#39;s probably too</text>
  <text start="372.67" dur="6.57">much I&amp;#39;m probably gonna cut back two to</text>
  <text start="375.4" dur="6.21">four because it&amp;#39;s growing so well but</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="4.2">that said you know there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="4.88">others that you can do like sunflower</text>
  <text start="383.44" dur="6.78">which is great healthy fat and protein</text>
  <text start="386.49" dur="5.62">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s mung there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.22" dur="3.36">wheatgrass which is very popular you</text>
  <text start="392.11" dur="3.59">know there and there&amp;#39;s business</text>
  <text start="393.58" dur="4.62">opportunities if you have a big shelf</text>
  <text start="395.7" dur="4.12">and you&amp;#39;re growing so much of this stuff</text>
  <text start="398.2" dur="2.85">well there&amp;#39;s people that make hundreds</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="3">thousands of dollars a year selling to</text>
  <text start="401.05" dur="5.45">their local restaurants and farmers</text>
  <text start="402.82" dur="5.97">markets and you know juice bars sports</text>
  <text start="406.5" dur="5.83">gyms you know that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="408.79" dur="6.15">so don&amp;#39;t underestimate the potential</text>
  <text start="412.33" dur="4.38">here for for business side of things but</text>
  <text start="414.94" dur="2.16">I&amp;#39;m just talking about the health side</text>
  <text start="416.71" dur="2.01">of things</text>
  <text start="417.1" dur="3.51">you know when I do microgreens it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="418.72" dur="2.25">a little jar to put in a salad once a</text>
  <text start="420.61" dur="3.51">week</text>
  <text start="420.97" dur="5.85">it is a smoothie full a blender every</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="5.34">day for myself and my family okay I want</text>
  <text start="426.82" dur="4.77">that high level you know impactful</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="4.77">nutrition it&amp;#39;s not quite Gerson diet</text>
  <text start="431.59" dur="4.77">level because they juice raw constant</text>
  <text start="434.23" dur="3.84">vegetables like the glasses a day of</text>
  <text start="436.36" dur="4.77">juice which is really difficult for me</text>
  <text start="438.07" dur="4.86">to afford but I would if I could because</text>
  <text start="441.13" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s the kind of nutrition impact that</text>
  <text start="442.93" dur="4.95">I want so I want to help you guys you</text>
  <text start="445.6" dur="4.17">know kind of motivate you to get into</text>
  <text start="447.88" dur="5.25">this a little bit start small start with</text>
  <text start="449.77" dur="4.89">one little 10 by 20 tray the reason I</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="3.87">like the 10 20 trays is because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="3.99">pretty cheap I got actually a really</text>
  <text start="457" dur="3.09">good quality one and sometimes you want</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="3.57">to double stack them or something and</text>
  <text start="460.09" dur="5.46">you want to go find maybe print out the</text>
  <text start="462.22" dur="5.43">directions for what the the requirement</text>
  <text start="465.55" dur="3.33">is to grow each individual plant like</text>
  <text start="467.65" dur="2.85">they all different some of them require</text>
  <text start="468.88" dur="3.48">darkness for a day some of them require</text>
  <text start="470.5" dur="5.07">you know different steps for germination</text>
  <text start="472.36" dur="5.31">but they&amp;#39;re all pretty darn simple and</text>
  <text start="475.57" dur="3.6">you know start small and you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="477.67" dur="3.81">have so much fun with this and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.17" dur="4.47">gonna probably feel better anyway and</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="3.9">throw this in a smoothie with some fruit</text>
  <text start="483.64" dur="3.99">and make it taste good put it in a salad</text>
  <text start="485.38" dur="5.01">maybe not this one unless you like spicy</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="5.19">stuff but wheatgrass is a good one to</text>
  <text start="490.39" dur="4.14">start with I guess if I had to pick one</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="4.56">of all it would probably be sunflower</text>
  <text start="494.53" dur="3.99">but you know there are great directions</text>
  <text start="497.38" dur="3.75">out there on how to do these things</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="4.71">individually each individual plant or</text>
  <text start="501.13" dur="4.35">lists of which ones do what and more</text>
  <text start="503.23" dur="4.53">Cole is a good place to start</text>
  <text start="505.48" dur="3.78">I just want to inspire people to maybe</text>
  <text start="507.76" dur="4.11">consider that doing this for themselves</text>
  <text start="509.26" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s cheaper than having to go buy</text>

  <text start="1359.899" dur="4.2">generally refer you to you know good</text>
  <text start="1362.659" dur="3.87">source articles where they talk about</text>
  <text start="1364.099" dur="6.06">that condition you know from a</text>
  <text start="1366.529" dur="4.801">perspective many of them I vetted many</text>
  <text start="1370.159" dur="3.51">of those conditions I&amp;#39;ve never even</text>

  <text start="1395.509" dur="3.181">will help you sometimes it you know I</text>
  <text start="1396.889" dur="3.21">can help a lot actually you know there</text>
  <text start="1398.69" dur="4.439">are some things that that are just</text>
  <text start="1400.099" dur="6.091">general good ideas to do in my opinion</text>
  <text start="1403.129" dur="5.51">when sick like juicing or like vitamin C</text>
  <text start="1406.19" dur="6.39">there are some things that seem to help</text>
  <text start="1408.639" dur="6.61">everything I mean take C 60 for example</text>
  <text start="1412.58" dur="4.799">go look up whatever condition that you</text>
  <text start="1415.249" dur="4.081">have go to Google type in your condition</text>
  <text start="1417.379" dur="5.01">you know blank whatever you fill in the</text>
  <text start="1419.33" dur="7.099">blank and then type in oxidative stress</text>
  <text start="1422.389" dur="6.48">okay this stuff basically stops</text>
  <text start="1426.429" dur="5.59">oxidative stress if you can believe the</text>
  <text start="1428.869" dur="5.64">research all right and I do and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1432.019" dur="4.171">extensive research associated with it so</text>
  <text start="1434.509" dur="4.02">you know you can start with the body</text>
  <text start="1436.19" dur="3.449">study where they did the BA ATI where</text>
  <text start="1438.529" dur="2.58">they did the rat study and they made the</text>
  <text start="1439.639" dur="2.73">rats live twice as long they were trying</text>
  <text start="1441.109" dur="4.26">to kill them that they didn&amp;#39;t they made</text>
  <text start="1442.369" dur="5.55">them live twice as long you can start</text>
  <text start="1445.369" dur="5.04">there but look up oxidative stress as</text>
  <text start="1447.919" dur="5.61">its associated with your your condition</text>
  <text start="1450.409" dur="5.13">and that&amp;#39;s a good example of what C 60</text>
  <text start="1453.529" dur="5.791">could do for that condition in theory</text>
  <text start="1455.539" dur="5.1">okay because this stuff basically blocks</text>
  <text start="1459.32" dur="3.719">and shields you from oxidative stress</text>
  <text start="1460.639" dur="3.931">and that means all the free radicals and</text>
  <text start="1463.039" dur="3.581">everything you&amp;#39;re constantly fighting</text>
  <text start="1464.57" dur="3.85">off take that</text>
  <text start="1466.62" dur="3.21">and block it and then what is your body</text>
  <text start="1468.42" dur="4.17">gonna do now it&amp;#39;s no longer in this</text>
  <text start="1469.83" dur="4.65">constant war those soldiers are gonna</text>
  <text start="1472.59" dur="3.81">come home from the trenches and focus on</text>
  <text start="1474.48" dur="3.87">everything else that needs to be focused</text>
  <text start="1476.4" dur="4.17">on that&amp;#39;s my opinion on why this stuff</text>
  <text start="1478.35" dur="3.66">is so good for the eyes your eyes are</text>
