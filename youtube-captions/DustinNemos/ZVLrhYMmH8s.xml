  <text start="346.169" dur="4.831">like it&amp;#39;s fun to be able to black the</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="4.41">eye of evil just once in a while and</text>
  <text start="351" dur="5.37">you&amp;#39;ve done that at least so far with</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="6.33">Tron and so you know you&amp;#39;ve seen to have</text>
  <text start="356.37" dur="4.95">you know jumped into the Q thing you you</text>
  <text start="359.01" dur="4.71">you you obviously you think it&amp;#39;s real</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="3.839">you buy into it being some sort of an</text>
  <text start="363.72" dur="5.669">insider you know people have their</text>
  <text start="365.159" dur="6.811">perspectives on who it is what do you</text>
  <text start="369.389" dur="4.231">think happens next we&amp;#39;ve got a lot of</text>
  <text start="371.97" dur="3.87">things that are supposed to happen in</text>
  <text start="373.62" dur="3.479">this year we&amp;#39;re very much near the end</text>
  <text start="375.84" dur="3.72">of this year there&amp;#39;s not a lot of year</text>
  <text start="377.099" dur="3.961">left and there&amp;#39;s also a lot of things</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="2.97">that could be happening right after the</text>
  <text start="381.06" dur="3.359">first January you know the executive</text>
  <text start="382.53" dur="4.02">order whatever how do you see it playing</text>
  <text start="384.419" dur="4.411">out I like the fact that there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="5.46">indictments is a really encouraging sign</text>
  <text start="388.83" dur="3.72">um I never really truly know what to</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="2.159">expect</text>
  <text start="392.55" dur="3">honestly the costs even mentioned that</text>
  <text start="394.169" dur="2.731">the Sylvan diamonds like Sarah Carter</text>
  <text start="395.55" dur="3.06">just blasted it out</text>
  <text start="396.9" dur="3.18">really immense you just mentioned it</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="3.119">yeah oh</text>
  <text start="400.08" dur="4.619">this is the stuff that gets my heart</text>
  <text start="401.729" dur="4.59">rate going I love it yeah right never</text>
  <text start="404.699" dur="3.481">know totally what to expect because</text>
  <text start="406.319" dur="3.9">sometimes there is purposeful</text>
  <text start="408.18" dur="3.72">misinformation it has to be that way</text>
  <text start="410.219" dur="3.331">because not only are we watching this</text>
  <text start="411.9" dur="3.989">stuff the enemies are watching this</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="4.619">stuff too and everyone in queue knows</text>
  <text start="415.889" dur="4.83">that a home so it&amp;#39;s really hard to</text>
  <text start="418.169" dur="4.59">pinpoint timelines and accuracies but</text>
  <text start="420.719" dur="3.991">there are too many things that just</text>
  <text start="422.759" dur="5.22">cannot be deemed coincidences at this</text>
  <text start="424.71" dur="5.34">point yeah enough to be fair cue kind of</text>
  <text start="427.979" dur="4.981">operates within that space of plausible</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="4.919">deniability if it becomes too obvious</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="4.049">they probably would want to back off and</text>
  <text start="434.969" dur="3.901">do some sort of justice punking thing</text>
  <text start="437.009" dur="3.9">then anything they said would be deemed</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="3.96">to be true and then the enemies on the</text>
  <text start="440.909" dur="5.04">other side could take that and then use</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="5.579">it to you know plan their next move yeah</text>
  <text start="445.949" dur="4.261">plus you know they if these guys</text>
  <text start="448.409" dur="3.87">actually got busted whether it&amp;#39;s true or</text>
  <text start="450.21" dur="3.569">not they would certainly be abused and</text>
  <text start="452.279" dur="4.021">charged in the court system with all</text>
  <text start="453.779" dur="4.471">sorts of you know classified violations</text>
  <text start="456.3" dur="3.209">which they haven&amp;#39;t really done but you</text>
  <text start="458.25" dur="3.81">get the idea they would they would be</text>
  <text start="459.509" dur="4.861">taken down so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s better that it</text>
  <text start="462.06" dur="4.05">exists this way but they have so much of</text>
  <text start="464.37" dur="3.659">a success rate if you were like a</text>
  <text start="466.11" dur="3.899">betting man the casino would have</text>
  <text start="468.029" dur="3.301">already been breaking your arms by now</text>
  <text start="470.009" dur="3.511">trying to figure out how you cheated the</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="4.769">system yeah he was really ahead of the</text>
  <text start="473.52" dur="4.98">game yes whether or not he fakes out a</text>
  <text start="476.099" dur="4.831">and folds a hand every now and then I</text>
  <text start="478.5" dur="4.229">think it&amp;#39;s possible deniability you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="5.579">hundred percent right you can fall back</text>
  <text start="482.729" dur="5.461">to that ya know so just in the</text>
  <text start="486.509" dur="5.701">mainstream though how do you see the</text>
  <text start="488.19" dur="6">next several months playing out I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="492.21" dur="4.319">know like until the mainstream actually</text>
  <text start="494.19" dur="3.689">starts mentioning queuing on like if</text>
  <text start="496.529" dur="2.161">they do that I think it&amp;#39;s gonna take off</text>
  <text start="497.879" dur="2.85">like a wildfire</text>
  <text start="498.69" dur="4.11">cuz it&amp;#39;s only gonna put a microscope on</text>
  <text start="500.729" dur="3.72">to this movement which is why they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="502.8" dur="3.51">talk about it which is why I think all</text>
  <text start="504.449" dur="2.881">the journalists have been instructed not</text>

  <text start="522.12" dur="4.38">when they actually posted like some of</text>
  <text start="523.769" dur="4.771">the metrics of how it was growing so</text>
  <text start="526.5" dur="3.839">fast like exponential growth like every</text>

  <text start="646.92" dur="4.979">a very sad commentary but it does give</text>
  <text start="649.769" dur="4.411">us in our generation here a chance to</text>
  <text start="651.899" dur="4.05">fix things so it gives us an advantage</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="4.05">to nothing to lose I think that&amp;#39;s why uh</text>
  <text start="655.949" dur="6.24">general Flynn liked me so much when I</text>
  <text start="658.23" dur="6.03">met him at home a digital warrior you</text>

  <text start="689.91" dur="4.979">whole situation with general Flynn is</text>
  <text start="692.25" dur="4.38">kind of a sad commentary on the whole</text>

  <text start="925.76" dur="3.48">I have a very tight-knit group of</text>
  <text start="927.32" dur="4.11">friends but everyone else in this world</text>
  <text start="929.24" dur="4.65">I have to like dumb it down too actually</text>
  <text start="931.43" dur="3.93">act in society it&amp;#39;s like you know you</text>
  <text start="933.89" dur="2.94">can kind of feel like the outcast some</text>
  <text start="935.36" dur="3.33">jobs but then you meet these other</text>
  <text start="936.83" dur="3.21">people who are doing you know spreading</text>
  <text start="938.69" dur="3.149">the same message you are and you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="940.04" dur="3.72">on that same frequency and it&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="941.839" dur="5.221">fun yeah have you ever heard of the</text>
  <text start="943.76" dur="4.8">Pareto principle no okay so this is this</text>
  <text start="947.06" dur="3.42">is gonna sound mean and I really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="948.56" dur="3.57">mean it to be mean but it is sort of a</text>
  <text start="950.48" dur="3.78">fact that kind of plays out</text>
  <text start="952.13" dur="5.04">mathematically in nature in all sorts of</text>
  <text start="954.26" dur="5.85">ways but the idea is that about 20% of</text>
  <text start="957.17" dur="5.85">people do about 80% of the work in any</text>
  <text start="960.11" dur="5.94">given area like be it mathematics fought</text>
  <text start="963.02" dur="6">any job you know dating whatever it is</text>
  <text start="966.05" dur="4.56">seems to apply across the spectrum and I</text>
  <text start="969.02" dur="3.39">think it also applies in the thinking</text>
  <text start="970.61" dur="4.64">Department so a lot of people they just</text>
  <text start="972.41" dur="5.52">sort of jump into the the herd think of</text>
  <text start="975.25" dur="4.63">already told me that this is a stupid</text>
  <text start="977.93" dur="4.71">conspiracy theory there for a laugh joke</text>
  <text start="979.88" dur="5.34">and move on 100% and I have heard of</text>
  <text start="982.64" dur="4.02">that theory or that principle yeah I</text>
  <text start="985.22" dur="3.21">think you&amp;#39;re absolutely right for sure</text>
  <text start="986.66" dur="4.29">it might even be less than percent of</text>
  <text start="988.43" dur="4.74">the people do the thinking than that for</text>
  <text start="990.95" dur="3.9">maybe 10 percent do the 90 percent of</text>
  <text start="993.17" dur="4.289">the thinking my theory on this is</text>
  <text start="994.85" dur="4.44">actually that it plays out about the</text>
  <text start="997.459" dur="3.241">same in terms of some of the</text>
  <text start="999.29" dur="4.38">intelligence like on the bell curve</text>
  <text start="1000.7" dur="4.74">there but a lot of those highly</text>

  <text start="2949.28" dur="4.68">like a spectrum this way where&amp;#39;s like I</text>
  <text start="2951.29" dur="4.92">am pretty left and left left left left</text>
  <text start="2953.96" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s a couple different options like</text>
  <text start="2956.21" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s the one where it&amp;#39;s like on the</text>
  <text start="2957.56" dur="2.73">left-hand side you&amp;#39;re more socialist on</text>
  <text start="2959.51" dur="2.88">the right-hand side you know</text>
  <text start="2960.29" dur="3.93">conservative on the bottom you&amp;#39;re more</text>
  <text start="2962.39" dur="3.54">like free market on the top you more</text>
  <text start="2964.22" dur="2.94">government authoritarian control I kind</text>
  <text start="2965.93" dur="3.179">of like that I kind of like that I just</text>
  <text start="2967.16" dur="3.33">think they&amp;#39;re the people who say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2969.109" dur="2.371">free thinkers and whatnot they&amp;#39;re like I</text>
  <text start="2970.49" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t want to be labeled there may be</text>
  <text start="2971.48" dur="3.51">lying and then we could Institute a</text>
  <text start="2973.46" dur="4.44">review system as well I think that would</text>
  <text start="2974.99" dur="4.59">be pretty neat yeah so I&amp;#39;m gonna love</text>
  <text start="2977.9" dur="2.85">the centralist though centralist can</text>
  <text start="2979.58" dur="2.73">just say I&amp;#39;m in the middle no matter</text>
  <text start="2980.75" dur="3.39">what and I don&amp;#39;t have to hold concrete</text>
  <text start="2982.31" dur="3.03">beliefs about anything no one has to</text>
  <text start="2984.14" dur="2.76">watch them I mean that&amp;#39;s the cool thing</text>
  <text start="2985.34" dur="3.39">about this way we give them like top</text>
  <text start="2986.9" dur="4.32">performers and stuff and it would be</text>
  <text start="2988.73" dur="5.01">really a way for people to coordinate</text>
  <text start="2991.22" dur="3.6">the very confusing myriad ways because</text>
  <text start="2993.74" dur="2.46">it&amp;#39;s dark it&amp;#39;s hard to keep up with</text>
  <text start="2994.82" dur="3.17">people when they&amp;#39;re always dropping your</text>
  <text start="2996.2" dur="3.84">link or deleting your channel or</text>
  <text start="2997.99" dur="2.77">unsubscribing people from you know</text>
  <text start="3000.04" dur="2.43">stupid things</text>
  <text start="3000.76" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s no all the tricks if they play</text>
  <text start="3002.47" dur="3.87">this will help us to get around that if</text>
  <text start="3004.18" dur="3.45">he&amp;#39;s willing to do the work yep I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3006.34" dur="2.82">gonna promote it and try to get</text>
  <text start="3007.63" dur="3.54">everybody to like sign up on it it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="3009.16" dur="3.78">completely like you know not</text>
  <text start="3011.17" dur="3.87">decentralized but as hands-off as</text>
  <text start="3012.94" dur="3.45">possible fair people can say what they</text>
  <text start="3015.04" dur="3.42">want about themselves there can be a</text>
  <text start="3016.39" dur="4.35">fair review system people can position</text>
  <text start="3018.46" dur="3.899">themselves on the chart you know the</text>
  <text start="3020.74" dur="3.36">things like that so I think it would be</text>
  <text start="3022.359" dur="3.151">kind of a neat way for people to track</text>
  <text start="3024.1" dur="3.42">the old media personalities that they</text>
  <text start="3025.51" dur="5.55">like discover new ones they&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="3027.52" dur="7.17">opposing viewpoints on suggestion would</text>
  <text start="3031.06" dur="5.79">be to make sure it hasn&amp;#39;t papal but if</text>
  <text start="3034.69" dur="4.38">all if at all possible try to get even</text>
  <text start="3036.85" dur="3.75">know how to do that yeah I think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3039.07" dur="3.21">making an app now about here so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3040.6" dur="2.85">everything yeah everything&amp;#39;s convenience</text>
  <text start="3042.28" dur="3">these days people don&amp;#39;t want to click</text>
  <text start="3043.45" dur="3.87">their browser even if it has the next</text>
  <text start="3045.28" dur="3.75">button goes to the website you know</text>
  <text start="3047.32" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s two clicks compared to one and it</text>
  <text start="3049.03" dur="3.18">shuts off half the people right there</text>
  <text start="3050.59" dur="4.529">and I&amp;#39;m such a low tech guy like I</text>
