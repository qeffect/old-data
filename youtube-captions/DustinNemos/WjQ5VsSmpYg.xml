  <text start="3.09" dur="5.49">most of destiny most calm and I am</text>
  <text start="5.31" dur="5.7">joined today by Jerry day and he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="8.58" dur="4.62">to help me break down some of the EMF</text>
  <text start="11.01" dur="4.53">issues that are facing us as a as a</text>
  <text start="13.2" dur="3.749">health problem obviously a lot of people</text>
  <text start="15.54" dur="3.45">out there having issues with this</text>
  <text start="16.949" dur="3.961">there&amp;#39;s people that can you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="18.99" dur="3.27">having massive health issues with it and</text>
  <text start="20.91" dur="3.72">then there&amp;#39;s other people there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="22.26" dur="4.41">just slow slow cooking or slow microwave</text>
  <text start="24.63" dur="2.43">and they don&amp;#39;t even know it how are you</text>
  <text start="26.67" dur="2.25">Jerry</text>
  <text start="27.06" dur="4.289">thank you for coming on the show oh good</text>
  <text start="28.92" dur="3.99">good I&amp;#39;m on yet hello nice to be with</text>
  <text start="31.349" dur="4.561">you Dustin thanks for inviting me on</text>
  <text start="32.91" dur="5.76">yeah it&amp;#39;s a I&amp;#39;m glad you can make time I</text>
  <text start="35.91" dur="4.14">I want to you know go down some of this</text>
  <text start="38.67" dur="3.36">stuff with somebody who knows more about</text>
  <text start="40.05" dur="4.77">it than I do I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="42.03" dur="4.5">health issues in general especially some</text>
  <text start="44.82" dur="4.23">of the things that are being done or are</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="4.38">kind of inflicted on people that maybe</text>
  <text start="49.05" dur="4.77">they don&amp;#39;t know about not specifically</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="6.75">just EMF but I have touched on that 5g</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="5.399">smart meters cell phones where would you</text>
  <text start="57.66" dur="4.079">like to start would you like to jump</text>
  <text start="59.219" dur="4.561">into the EMF maybe as a whole and kind</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="3.6">of get there yeah well I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="4.5">what my background is or what my</text>
  <text start="65.339" dur="4.681">exposure is to this whole field five or</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="4.11">six years ago maybe a little longer I</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="4.02">put up a couple of videos the first</text>
  <text start="72.39" dur="5.07">video I think that I put up was just</text>
  <text start="74.04" dur="5.61">called smart meters and at that time all</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="4.26">I knew about was the surveillance aspect</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="4.56">of it and I looked at what a smart meter</text>
  <text start="81.72" dur="4.98">was and I thought man they&amp;#39;ve got data</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="4.53">recording data storage data processing</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="5.82">data transmission this is a surveillance</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="6.03">device and nobody really even to this</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="5.16">day not nobody but very few people</text>
  <text start="94.77" dur="5.16">really realize that even though there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="5.549">health effects that this surveillance is</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="5.91">going to really affect your life you</text>
  <text start="103.229" dur="4.71">have got a surveillance device on your</text>
  <text start="105.84" dur="5.19">home that collects personal living</text>
  <text start="107.939" dur="5.581">habits of you and your family all day</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="5.31">long and that goes into a permanent</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="4.8">database that is stored and controlled</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="4.95">by someone you don&amp;#39;t even know and you</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t have any access to that data you</text>
  <text start="121.29" dur="3.679">don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s telling them and</text>
  <text start="122.85" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;ve put in very sophisticated</text>
  <text start="124.969" dur="8.861">algorithms to determine what this data</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="7.86">means and what I mean by that is when</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="5.34">you&amp;#39;ve got a single mother who&amp;#39;s got two</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="5.79">small children and she&amp;#39;s a member of the</text>
  <text start="139.17" dur="4.65">PTA and she&amp;#39;s a member of a couple other</text>
  <text start="141.96" dur="5.34">parent groups and she takes your kids to</text>
  <text start="143.82" dur="7.14">these meetings at night she uses her</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="8.1">hairdryer four times five times a week</text>
  <text start="150.96" dur="8.7">at in the evening the algorithms that</text>
  <text start="155.4" dur="7.38">are used to analyze her behavior tell us</text>
  <text start="159.66" dur="5.22">that she has two small children and she</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="5.31">uses her hairdryer four or five times a</text>
  <text start="164.88" dur="6.18">week even on the weekends and she is</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="5.19">there for probably a partyer and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="4.47">probably out at the bars and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.28" dur="4.2">probably using drugs and she&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="3.45">a very irresponsible mother because</text>
  <text start="177.48" dur="3.63">she&amp;#39;s getting her hair all dolled up and</text>
  <text start="178.98" dur="4.47">probably leaving her kids alone at home</text>
  <text start="181.11" dur="6.39">and we&amp;#39;re gonna send Child Protective</text>
  <text start="183.45" dur="6.63">Services to examine the situation and</text>
  <text start="187.5" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ve known situations actually in my</text>
  <text start="190.08" dur="4.62">area where Child Protective Services</text>
  <text start="191.52" dur="6.21">have come to someone&amp;#39;s house on a hunch</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="7.83">like that and found in this particular</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="8.58">case one beer can in the house and took</text>
  <text start="202.53" dur="6.48">the children so this is why they want</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="5.13">the data they want to act on you they</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="4.5">want to act against you and they want to</text>
  <text start="211.44" dur="4.59">make money on that somehow you wanted up</text>
  <text start="213.51" dur="3.81">paying tremendous fees and fines and</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="4.47">penalties for different types of</text>
  <text start="217.32" dur="5.19">behavior that are you know nobody would</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="3.42">know anything about because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="3.84">happening in the privacy of your own</text>
  <text start="223.92" dur="4.05">home except it&amp;#39;s very clear when you</text>
  <text start="226.35" dur="4.38">have a smart meter or electronic meter</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s very clear the kinds of things</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re doing what time of day you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.17" dur="4.77">doing them how many people are doing</text>
  <text start="234.45" dur="4.8">them whether they&amp;#39;re adults or children</text>
  <text start="236.94" dur="5.82">all kinds of things become extremely</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="6.84">clear when you can analyze the time of</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="6.449">use of all these appliances and be very</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="6.179">clear they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re algorithms</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="5.851">recognize the appliances they even</text>
  <text start="252.269" dur="4.71">recognize the models they even recognize</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="4.109">the condition of the appliance because</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="5.491">they&amp;#39;re looking at current draw profile</text>
  <text start="259.169" dur="5.281">so if I have an air conditioner they can</text>
  <text start="262.47" dur="3.69">see that it&amp;#39;s an air conditioner if my</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="3.24">air conditioners bearings are kind of</text>
  <text start="266.16" dur="3.66">wearing out they can</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="4.2">see that and they will in many cases the</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="5.34">power company will sell you an insurance</text>
  <text start="271.89" dur="6.15">contract and they will promise to notify</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="5.1">you 90 days before your air conditioner</text>
  <text start="278.04" dur="4.2">fails and that&amp;#39;s the data that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="4.71">using your smart meter data to identify</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="4.05">that they know what kind of appliances</text>
  <text start="284.97" dur="2.73">you&amp;#39;ve got how they&amp;#39;re running what</text>
  <text start="286.29" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re doing with them when you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="287.7" dur="5.64">them on and off and all of your</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="6.03">electrical devices so you know this will</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="5.58">only get worse with the Internet of</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="5.91">Things where they literally will have a</text>
  <text start="298.92" dur="4.55">camera on your coffeemaker and watch you</text>
  <text start="301.56" dur="4.68">making coffee you know they&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="5.41">audio/video telemetry from these</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="5.69">appliances but obviously also the</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="7.11">telemetry of when they&amp;#39;re on and off so</text>
  <text start="311.93" dur="6.28">the the invasiveness of this is so far</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="6.42">beyond anything people are able to</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="5.73">imagine where you will have violations</text>
  <text start="322.41" dur="5.52">of the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="6.63">Rights that were never imagined by our</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="5.52">founding fathers obviously and not</text>
  <text start="330.57" dur="5.67">imagined by most homeowners who allow</text>
  <text start="333.45" dur="5.85">them to put these you know meters on</text>
  <text start="336.24" dur="5.429">their homes so so it&amp;#39;s the the</text>
  <text start="339.3" dur="4.95">surveillance was my very first red flag</text>
  <text start="341.669" dur="5.011">on these meters and I put a video up</text>
  <text start="344.25" dur="5.97">online and it went to two million views</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="6.06">and of course since then has been</text>
  <text start="350.22" dur="5.01">suppressed in terms of you know you know</text>
  <text start="352.74" dur="5.79">YouTube is suppressing and censoring so</text>
  <text start="355.23" dur="5.49">much information I&amp;#39;ve had two videos go</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="4.41">up to two million views and then just</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="4.68">flat plateau you know they don&amp;#39;t allow</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="4.62">my messages to get more than two million</text>
  <text start="365.4" dur="5.16">views and you know they manipulate</text>
  <text start="367.56" dur="5.76">chairs and likes even subscriptions you</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="5.22">subscribe and they never get any you</text>
  <text start="373.32" dur="4.83">know notices of new posts you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="375.78" dur="7.29">and of course be monetization all that</text>
  <text start="378.15" dur="7.92">so I haven&amp;#39;t been hard censored like you</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="5.55">know Alex Jones or people but but</text>
  <text start="386.07" dur="5.04">definitely a lot of manipulation a lot</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="5.88">of lost revenue a lot of lost view</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="5.04">counts but I still have a reach you know</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="4.14">and you can still directly share things</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="4.019">you know if you send somebody a link in</text>
  <text start="398.64" dur="2.58">an email or you know these direct share</text>
  <text start="400.169" dur="5.671">type of methods</text>
  <text start="401.22" dur="7.26">they do work and things do go viral I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="5.76">say viral not as much as two years ago</text>
  <text start="408.48" dur="6.78">but but you can get a reach now so it</text>
  <text start="411.6" dur="7.41">started with that concern about privacy</text>
  <text start="415.26" dur="6.66">and surveillance and of course then the</text>
  <text start="419.01" dur="5.67">whole can of worms opens about what</text>
  <text start="421.92" dur="5.49">these meters are really doing and what</text>
  <text start="424.68" dur="5.7">it&amp;#39;s really inside of them and there are</text>
  <text start="427.41" dur="6.45">a very specific number of violations</text>
  <text start="430.38" dur="6.89">that these meters commit against the</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="6.27">house the home the occupants and</text>
  <text start="437.27" dur="4.48">obviously surveillance one then you get</text>
  <text start="440.13" dur="3.84">to the radiation everybody knows about</text>
  <text start="441.75" dur="4.56">the radiation this is high energy</text>
  <text start="443.97" dur="5.88">density pulsed radiation this is what</text>
  <text start="446.31" dur="7.56">Barrie Trower physicist expert on EMF</text>
  <text start="449.85" dur="5.43">weaponry says is weaponized radiation it</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="4.47">has to be because it has to penetrate</text>
  <text start="455.28" dur="5.76">your walls in order to get out to the</text>
  <text start="458.34" dur="5.07">relays and the pickups and so if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="461.04" dur="3.99">going to penetrate walls and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.41" dur="5.009">certainly going to penetrate your body</text>
  <text start="465.03" dur="5.58">and if it&amp;#39;s penetrating your body is</text>
  <text start="468.419" dur="4.771">there anything harmful there and the</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="4.71">answer of course is yes any kind of</text>
  <text start="473.19" dur="4.44">radiation that penetrates your body is</text>
  <text start="475.32" dur="4.77">harmful it&amp;#39;s going to damage your DNA</text>

  <text start="1123.509" dur="5.701">have been and I I just had a thought the</text>
  <text start="1127.47" dur="3.27">other day how are they gonna do this you</text>
  <text start="1129.21" dur="3.66">know this when you go into the higher</text>
  <text start="1130.74" dur="4.679">frequency you have to have much more</text>
  <text start="1132.87" dur="4.11">many more and your listeners probably</text>
  <text start="1135.419" dur="5.521">know about this that they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="1148.44" dur="4.589">have one cell tower</text>
  <text start="1150.419" dur="6.09">you know quarter of a mile down the road</text>

  <text start="1902.279" dur="5.971">are getting sick and damaged by EMF</text>
  <text start="1905.84" dur="4.12">can&amp;#39;t feel it can&amp;#39;t see it can&amp;#39;t touch</text>
  <text start="1908.25" dur="4.62">it the people who are electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="1909.96" dur="4.77">sensitive do know when they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1912.87" dur="3.84">made sick in certain ways but they could</text>
  <text start="1914.73" dur="3.809">be damaged in other ways that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1916.71" dur="5.219">not feeling or whatever so it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="1918.539" dur="6.211">good to have some scanning meter some</text>
  <text start="1921.929" dur="6.211">kind of a device to to scan your</text>
  <text start="1924.75" dur="6.809">location we have by the way at EMF Help</text>
  <text start="1928.14" dur="6.18">Center comm there are some very good</text>
  <text start="1931.559" dur="4.59">tutorial videos on how to use those</text>
  <text start="1934.32" dur="3.75">meters you know you buy the meter and</text>
  <text start="1936.149" dur="3.241">there&amp;#39;s very little instruction and</text>
  <text start="1938.07" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re certainly not a building</text>
  <text start="1939.39" dur="3.21">biologist so you really don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="1941.13" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re doing and you need a little</text>
  <text start="1942.6" dur="4.53">tutorial to show you how to read the</text>
  <text start="1944.37" dur="4.59">meter what the numbers mean what the</text>
  <text start="1947.13" dur="3.6">standards are for the building</text>
  <text start="1948.96" dur="4.02">biologists and is like if it&amp;#39;s above</text>
  <text start="1950.73" dur="4.53">this that could hurt you if you&amp;#39;re below</text>
  <text start="1952.98" dur="3.66">that you&amp;#39;re safe you know the exact</text>
  <text start="1955.26" dur="5.669">readings we&amp;#39;ve got all that in our</text>
  <text start="1956.64" dur="6.48">tutorial videos at EMF Help Center comm</text>
  <text start="1960.929" dur="3.571">so I recommend those videos they&amp;#39;re free</text>
  <text start="1963.12" dur="1.89">just click on them and watch them and</text>
  <text start="1964.5" dur="2.76">I&amp;#39;ll show you</text>
  <text start="1965.01" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re usually operating a particular</text>
  <text start="1967.26" dur="4.86">scanning meter to show you how to do it</text>
  <text start="1969.45" dur="4.68">and then you know what scanning meters</text>
  <text start="1972.12" dur="4.26">maybe you want to go by or go find and</text>
  <text start="1974.13" dur="6.48">purchase that&amp;#39;s a great idea</text>
  <text start="1976.38" dur="6.419">so my next natural question here is are</text>
  <text start="1980.61" dur="4.02">we developing a lot of community</text>
  <text start="1982.799" dur="3.811">pushback or is there any legislation</text>
  <text start="1984.63" dur="5.159">that&amp;#39;s maybe going through to help is</text>
  <text start="1986.61" dur="5.309">there any press in that area no it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1989.789" dur="4.86">over the place yes is the answer and</text>
  <text start="1991.919" dur="5.071">there are entire states that are putting</text>
  <text start="1994.649" dur="4.77">moratoriums on certain types of things</text>
  <text start="1996.99" dur="6.59">even in some cases counties or cities</text>
  <text start="1999.419" dur="7.621">even prohibiting the installation of the</text>
  <text start="2003.58" dur="6.1">electronic utility meters which everyone</text>
  <text start="2007.04" dur="4.65">should do you know but of course the</text>
  <text start="2009.68" dur="2.79">utility companies are extremely powerful</text>
  <text start="2011.69" dur="3.36">you know when you&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="2012.47" dur="3.99">government protected monopolies having a</text>
  <text start="2015.05" dur="3.48">monopoly it&amp;#39;s bad enough you know</text>

  <text start="2018.53" dur="5.58">government protected monopoly you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2021.41" dur="5.04">have a chance and then put on top of</text>
  <text start="2024.11" dur="5.82">that that if you go into a lawsuit the</text>
  <text start="2026.45" dur="5.94">judge that&amp;#39;s judging your case who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2029.93" dur="5.36">probably very wealthy is investing his</text>
  <text start="2032.39" dur="5.73">pension fund in the utility company so</text>
  <text start="2035.29" dur="6.66">you know you find up these I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2038.12" dur="6.24">this you find these bizarre rulings</text>
  <text start="2041.95" dur="5.23">against people who are coming out</text>
  <text start="2044.36" dur="4.2">against electromagnetic sensitivity they</text>
  <text start="2047.18" dur="2.67">go right into court they have all the</text>
  <text start="2048.56" dur="3.359">evidence all the science and</text>
  <text start="2049.85" dur="3.96">miraculously the judge says you know I</text>
  <text start="2051.919" dur="3.901">guess that&amp;#39;s the fact that I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="2053.81" dur="3.99">decide this other thing today and you</text>
  <text start="2055.82" dur="4.08">have no idea why well the judge is</text>
  <text start="2057.8" dur="4.29">investing in the power company the judge</text>
  <text start="2059.9" dur="3.69">is invested in utilities up to his neck</text>
  <text start="2062.09" dur="3.99">and not telling anybody you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2063.59" dur="4.35">disclosing this so you know at this</text>
  <text start="2066.08" dur="4.65">point finding a judge that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2067.94" dur="5.1">invested in utilities is next to</text>
  <text start="2070.73" dur="5.88">impossible so how are you supposed to</text>
  <text start="2073.04" dur="6.24">get justice this is this is a very very</text>
  <text start="2076.61" dur="5.37">big problem you know think about that</text>
  <text start="2079.28" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s it stacks up you know that that you</text>
  <text start="2081.98" dur="4.98">need your electricity you&amp;#39;re dependent</text>
  <text start="2084.11" dur="4.44">on this service then there are</text>
  <text start="2086.96" dur="3.51">monopolies then there are government</text>
  <text start="2088.55" dur="4.44">controlled monopolies and then the</text>
  <text start="2090.47" dur="5.31">courts won&amp;#39;t help you or protect you and</text>
  <text start="2092.99" dur="4.73">the cops know nothing you want to look</text>
  <text start="2095.78" dur="5.34">at somebody ignorant on electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="2097.72" dur="5.23">sensitivity ignorant on the harm that</text>
  <text start="2101.12" dur="3.84">EMF does to people you know they know</text>
  <text start="2102.95" dur="4.5">what a bullet does to somebody but they</text>
  <text start="2104.96" dur="4.05">have absolutely no clue what</text>
  <text start="2107.45" dur="3.84">electromagnetic radiation does to</text>
  <text start="2109.01" dur="4.86">anybody and so getting a you know</text>
  <text start="2111.29" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s actually police who come to</text>
  <text start="2113.87" dur="4.56">somebody&amp;#39;s location to arrest the</text>
  <text start="2115.7" dur="5.28">homeowner for not letting the electric</text>
  <text start="2118.43" dur="5.52">company install the meter it&amp;#39;s part of</text>
  <text start="2120.98" dur="5.67">this totally insane you know these these</text>
  <text start="2123.95" dur="5.34">the ignorance you know you you wonder</text>
  <text start="2126.65" dur="5.91">how how weakens just how we can just</text>
  <text start="2129.29" dur="4.8">shut down this public expense paying</text>
  <text start="2132.56" dur="4.11">these people if they&amp;#39;re gonna behave</text>
  <text start="2134.09" dur="4.95">like that if they can&amp;#39;t conduct</text>
  <text start="2136.67" dur="3.78">themselves better and figure out what</text>
  <text start="2139.04" dur="4.17">the real problem is</text>
  <text start="2140.45" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s crony late I&amp;#39;m a number on this</text>
  <text start="2143.21" dur="5.61">country this world yeah so I true I</text>
  <text start="2146.75" dur="6.63">tried to help a woman in I believe</text>
  <text start="2148.82" dur="7.38">Chicago I&amp;#39;m sorry uh somewhere in the</text>
  <text start="2153.38" dur="6.5">Midwest who was who had been arrested</text>
  <text start="2156.2" dur="5.94">for refusing to allow someone to put a</text>
  <text start="2159.88" dur="4">radiation emitting fire hazard</text>
  <text start="2162.14" dur="4.26">surveillance device on her property</text>
  <text start="2163.88" dur="6.09">she was arrested for not letting them do</text>
  <text start="2166.4" dur="5.55">that now how do you get there and she</text>
  <text start="2169.97" dur="4.23">had to go to court under a criminal</text>
  <text start="2171.95" dur="5.129">charge and this was a woman I believe in</text>
  <text start="2174.2" dur="4.74">her late 50s or early 60s had never been</text>
  <text start="2177.079" dur="6.121">arrested no criminal record very</text>
  <text start="2178.94" dur="7.83">compliant arrested as a criminal for not</text>
  <text start="2183.2" dur="5.58">permitting someone to harm her and the</text>
  <text start="2186.77" dur="5.12">entire justice system couldn&amp;#39;t recognize</text>
  <text start="2188.78" dur="6.089">this was an act of self-defense and the</text>
  <text start="2191.89" dur="5.86">the technical thing she was arrested for</text>
  <text start="2194.869" dur="6">was tampering with her meter and all she</text>
  <text start="2197.75" dur="6.48">did was remove it and return it to the</text>
  <text start="2200.869" dur="5.371">company is that tampering and by the way</text>
  <text start="2204.23" dur="3.389">she had given them prior notice that if</text>
  <text start="2206.24" dur="2.64">they didn&amp;#39;t give her a safe in lawful</text>
  <text start="2207.619" dur="3.681">meter she would do that</text>
  <text start="2208.88" dur="5.55">so this was all in writing on the record</text>
  <text start="2211.3" dur="5.5">so she was as innocent as you could get</text>
  <text start="2214.43" dur="5.389">in terms of any harm to that power</text>
  <text start="2216.8" dur="5.43">company and she was convicted of a crime</text>
  <text start="2219.819" dur="5.76">of tampering with her meter that</text>
  <text start="2222.23" dur="5.55">happened to be in her state a crime and</text>
  <text start="2225.579" dur="4.78">had she has a criminal record now she</text>
  <text start="2227.78" dur="5.28">had to do a plea bargain it&amp;#39;s terrible</text>
  <text start="2230.359" dur="4.441">so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the service our</text>
  <text start="2233.06" dur="3.38">courts are giving us our judges are</text>
  <text start="2234.8" dur="4.89">police that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing for us</text>
  <text start="2236.44" dur="5.56">yeah we can&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t expect you kind</text>
  <text start="2239.69" dur="5.669">of justice from the government on many</text>
  <text start="2242" dur="5.46">issues I actually got one of the it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2245.359" dur="5.46">not like the brand that&amp;#39;s already shaped</text>
  <text start="2247.46" dur="5.55">but it&amp;#39;s one of the the mesh protectors</text>
  <text start="2250.819" dur="4.651">that goes on oh yeah yeah block that</text>
  <text start="2253.01" dur="4.8">what do you think of those you you might</text>
  <text start="2255.47" dur="5.73">be making a big mistake here&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="2257.81" dur="6.32">here&amp;#39;s how that works when you agree to</text>
  <text start="2261.2" dur="5.639">accept electric service from a company</text>
  <text start="2264.13" dur="6.07">you are presumed to agree to all their</text>
  <text start="2266.839" dur="5.221">terms of conditions and unless you say</text>
  <text start="2270.2" dur="3.81">otherwise and one of their terms and</text>
  <text start="2272.06" dur="6.45">conditions is they get to get there</text>
  <text start="2274.01" dur="6.95">from your meter and when you put a</text>
  <text start="2278.51" dur="5.4">screen on that and put a barrier on that</text>
  <text start="2280.96" dur="4.96">you&amp;#39;re defeating that and so technically</text>
  <text start="2283.91" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;ve gone into violation of contract</text>
  <text start="2285.92" dur="4.05">with your power company and they have</text>
  <text start="2287.69" dur="4.77">right of penalty against you right of</text>
  <text start="2289.97" dur="6.51">termination of service if you refuse you</text>
  <text start="2292.46" dur="6.75">know all the way and the other problem</text>
  <text start="2296.48" dur="5.01">is why are you screening you know this</text>
  <text start="2299.21" dur="4.05">is not you but many people they I talk</text>
  <text start="2301.49" dur="3.98">to people all the time is this is their</text>
  <text start="2303.26" dur="4.17">idea I go why are you screening</text>
  <text start="2305.47" dur="4.33">radiation that&amp;#39;s going out into the</text>
  <text start="2307.43" dur="4.26">street how is that protecting you the</text>
  <text start="2309.8" dur="5.07">the radiation that&amp;#39;s coming into the</text>
  <text start="2311.69" dur="5.31">home is what is harming you and so you</text>
  <text start="2314.87" dur="4.59">want to do some shielding and screening</text>
  <text start="2317" dur="4.38">behind the meter luckily in the state of</text>
  <text start="2319.46" dur="4.44">California where I am we have these</text>
  <text start="2321.38" dur="6.03">robust metal service panels that do</text>
  <text start="2323.9" dur="5.31">deflect a lot of the radiofrequency but</text>
  <text start="2327.41" dur="4.38">you know that just means they have to up</text>
  <text start="2329.21" dur="5.19">the power to get certain places with</text>
  <text start="2331.79" dur="6.6">their broadcast with their data they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2334.4" dur="6.9">collecting on you but what I tell people</text>
  <text start="2338.39" dur="5.16">is shield if you get a shield shield the</text>
  <text start="2341.3" dur="5.82">inside of your house though your living</text>
  <text start="2343.55" dur="7.32">spaces and make sure over and above</text>
  <text start="2347.12" dur="7.62">anything that children are not sleeping</text>
  <text start="2350.87" dur="6.12">near a smart meter are not spending a</text>
  <text start="2354.74" dur="4.04">lot of their living time near a smart</text>
  <text start="2356.99" dur="4.56">meter that the meter is nowhere near</text>
  <text start="2358.78" dur="5.14">sleeping children get them across the</text>
  <text start="2361.55" dur="6">even if they&amp;#39;re sleeping in the basement</text>
  <text start="2363.92" dur="5.91">or whatever do not allow children to be</text>
  <text start="2367.55" dur="7.02">near that meter and and they&amp;#39;re far more</text>
  <text start="2369.83" dur="6.45">susceptible and they have their serious</text>
  <text start="2374.57" dur="5.04">permanent damage that happens to young</text>
  <text start="2376.28" dur="6.81">girl&amp;#39;s reproductive systems with</text>
  <text start="2379.61" dur="5.37">radiation so so it&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
  <text start="2383.09" dur="6.54">pay attention of that problem with</text>
  <text start="2384.98" dur="7.2">children yes the word soft kill comes to</text>
  <text start="2389.63" dur="5.51">mind when I you know things yeah no now</text>
  <text start="2392.18" dur="8.91">I wanted to just complete the thought on</text>
  <text start="2395.14" dur="7.93">shielding your meter when when you have</text>
  <text start="2401.09" dur="5.7">a device that&amp;#39;s emitting radiation you</text>
  <text start="2403.07" dur="4.92">have a big problem and and just putting</text>
  <text start="2406.79" dur="3.63">a shield on it obvious</text>
  <text start="2407.99" dur="4.71">especially if the shield is protecting</text>
  <text start="2410.42" dur="4.23">from broadcasting away from you there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2412.7" dur="3.32">no point in that that was the point I</text>
  <text start="2414.65" dur="3.51">want to make it in other words don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2416.02" dur="3.88">you&amp;#39;re just going to get into a huge</text>
  <text start="2418.16" dur="3.48">battle with your power company who can</text>
  <text start="2419.9" dur="3.48">no longer get their data and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2421.64" dur="4.62">gonna accuse you of doing things that</text>
  <text start="2423.38" dur="5.46">under their contract you do not have the</text>
  <text start="2426.26" dur="5.55">right to do to defeat their maintenance</text>
  <text start="2428.84" dur="4.77">in operations and it&amp;#39;s like people who</text>
  <text start="2431.81" dur="4.71">lock their gates and say oh you just</text>
  <text start="2433.61" dur="4.98">can&amp;#39;t get into my yard to change the</text>
  <text start="2436.52" dur="4.89">meter I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna not let you in</text>
  <text start="2438.59" dur="4.68">my yard well sorry you just blew your</text>
  <text start="2441.41" dur="4.02">your agreement with the power company</text>
  <text start="2443.27" dur="4.11">well if they&amp;#39;re going to provide</text>
  <text start="2445.43" dur="3.93">electricity to you they have to access</text>
  <text start="2447.38" dur="4.65">their equipment they have to perform</text>
  <text start="2449.36" dur="4.74">maintenance unfortunately what they</text>
  <text start="2452.03" dur="4.53">decided is maintenance is putting in a</text>
  <text start="2454.1" dur="4.5">very harmful meter so now you&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="2456.56" dur="5.91">problem so what you have to do is tell</text>
  <text start="2458.6" dur="5.64">them you can come into my yard but you</text>
  <text start="2462.47" dur="3.12">cannot put a harmful device on my</text>
  <text start="2464.24" dur="3.6">property and you have to do that with</text>
  <text start="2465.59" dur="4.26">legal notices we&amp;#39;ve got free downloads</text>
  <text start="2467.84" dur="5.43">at freedom packard.com you&amp;#39;ve seen those</text>
  <text start="2469.85" dur="5.07">maybe and you can notice them on that</text>
  <text start="2473.27" dur="4.62">but it&amp;#39;s kind of like going into battle</text>
  <text start="2474.92" dur="4.38">with Goliath you know it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="2477.89" dur="3.24">all the money and attorneys and</text>
  <text start="2479.3" dur="3.51">government power and regulations in</text>

  <text start="2588.8" dur="5.13">criminals you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost</text>

  <text start="2604.1" dur="5.01">accept something that will harm me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2606.29" dur="3.87">very hard to do that we&amp;#39;re conditioned</text>
  <text start="2609.11" dur="3.99">to think that these service providers</text>
  <text start="2610.16" dur="5.52">are benign but level benevolent people</text>
  <text start="2613.1" dur="5.76">who are helping us they&amp;#39;re not not in</text>
  <text start="2615.68" dur="6.27">the case of electric utility customer</text>
  <text start="2618.86" dur="4.95">service employees anymore if it&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="2621.95" dur="4.11">that they have turned to the dark side</text>

  <text start="2633.29" dur="4.53">company said this is safe you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="2634.88" dur="5.4">nutcase you know so you get that all the</text>
  <text start="2637.82" dur="4.71">time and even if you really know the</text>
  <text start="2640.28" dur="4.95">technology and you tell them they go oh</text>
  <text start="2642.53" dur="3.84">yes see you&amp;#39;re a nut case because they</text>
  <text start="2645.23" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t even know what you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="2646.37" dur="7.26">about so that&amp;#39;s how hard it is and yeah</text>
  <text start="2650.6" dur="5.85">so so what I&amp;#39;ve done now instead of</text>
  <text start="2653.63" dur="6.96">leading people through this battle and</text>
  <text start="2656.45" dur="8.85">getting trounced by these evil rich you</text>
  <text start="2660.59" dur="8.52">know people is go into workarounds so</text>
  <text start="2665.3" dur="8.97">you don&amp;#39;t go into head along battle for</text>
  <text start="2669.11" dur="7.76">instance I&amp;#39;m now joining forces with a</text>
  <text start="2674.27" dur="7.8">company that makes a line</text>
  <text start="2676.87" dur="7.66">that number one restores your sign wave</text>
  <text start="2682.07" dur="5.43">current integrity in other words defeats</text>
  <text start="2684.53" dur="5.04">the damage that the dirty electricity</text>
  <text start="2687.5" dur="4.11">coming from the grid and from your</text>
  <text start="2689.57" dur="4.17">electric meters switching my power</text>
  <text start="2691.61" dur="3.96">supply that&amp;#39;s all cleaned up by this</text>
  <text start="2693.74" dur="3.39">line conditioner it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="2695.57" dur="5.67">electronic device electrical device</text>
  <text start="2697.13" dur="7.35">installed between the meter and your</text>
  <text start="2701.24" dur="4.89">service panel so it&amp;#39;s on your side and</text>
  <text start="2704.48" dur="3.66">the power company has nothing they can</text>
  <text start="2706.13" dur="4.53">say about this and not only does it</text>
  <text start="2708.14" dur="3.96">recondition your power and by the way</text>
  <text start="2710.66" dur="3.27">that protects your appliances your</text>
  <text start="2712.1" dur="4.77">appliances are damaged by that dirty</text>
  <text start="2713.93" dur="5.37">electricity as well as people&amp;#39;s so not</text>
  <text start="2716.87" dur="4.73">only does it protect you on that but it</text>
  <text start="2719.3" dur="5.91">has this one that I&amp;#39;m representing has</text>
  <text start="2721.6" dur="6.55">capacitors in it which level out the</text>
  <text start="2725.21" dur="6.12">consumption in certain ways so that the</text>
  <text start="2728.15" dur="4.17">surveillance is defeated and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2731.33" dur="2.52">know what you&amp;#39;re doing when you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2732.32" dur="3.45">it they can&amp;#39;t tell they can&amp;#39;t identify</text>
  <text start="2733.85" dur="4.83">current draw profile they can&amp;#39;t identify</text>
  <text start="2735.77" dur="5.97">appliances so so there&amp;#39;s a lot of it</text>
  <text start="2738.68" dur="5.27">that they can&amp;#39;t see and certainly they</text>
  <text start="2741.74" dur="5.13">would have a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="2743.95" dur="5.05">determining behavioral patterns once you</text>
  <text start="2746.87" dur="5.16">put this line conditioner in so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2749" dur="5.15">you&amp;#39;re fixing two problems the dirty</text>
  <text start="2752.03" dur="4.92">electricity and the surveillance and</text>
  <text start="2754.15" dur="4.93">then you get to the radiation of the</text>
  <text start="2756.95" dur="4.98">transmitter and you can do certain</text>
  <text start="2759.08" dur="6.27">shielding for that and then the surge</text>
  <text start="2761.93" dur="5.97">protector protection issue what I like</text>
  <text start="2765.35" dur="7.47">to tell people is call your power</text>
  <text start="2767.9" dur="7.17">company and say for fire protection you</text>
  <text start="2772.82" dur="6.27">absolutely must have a surge protector</text>
  <text start="2775.07" dur="6.72">on a utility meter do you have one</text>
  <text start="2779.09" dur="5.64">and you&amp;#39;ll the first person you talk to</text>
  <text start="2781.79" dur="5.64">will say oh gee I don&amp;#39;t know and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2784.73" dur="4.68">say well find out and then you&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="2787.43" dur="3.72">somebody maybe a technician back call</text>
  <text start="2789.41" dur="3.9">you back an engineer call you back and</text>
  <text start="2791.15" dur="4.62">say well no these are these are safe</text>
  <text start="2793.31" dur="4.77">though these are these never burn up or</text>
  <text start="2795.77" dur="5.25">erupt in flames and these you know and</text>
  <text start="2798.08" dur="4.35">you say will its withstand a 20,000 volt</text>
  <text start="2801.02" dur="3.33">and by the way that&amp;#39;s a lie they</text>
  <text start="2802.43" dur="4.71">thousands and thousands of homes have</text>
  <text start="2804.35" dur="5.37">burned from electronic utility meters</text>
  <text start="2807.14" dur="4.29">that it&amp;#39;s an outright lie that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2809.72" dur="4.08">you right to your face and then you say</text>
  <text start="2811.43" dur="4.88">well well that meteor you&amp;#39;re putting on</text>
  <text start="2813.8" dur="3.9">my home withstand a 20,000 volt surge</text>
  <text start="2816.31" dur="3.28">abba-abba-abba</text>
  <text start="2817.7" dur="4.649">you know they&amp;#39;ll double talk to you on</text>
  <text start="2819.59" dur="5.25">that so so now you&amp;#39;ve got a situation</text>
  <text start="2822.349" dur="5.461">where okay if you by the way why won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2824.84" dur="4.5">anybody insure me for fire from my smart</text>
  <text start="2827.81" dur="3.39">meter why is it that my property</text>
  <text start="2829.34" dur="4.259">insurance won&amp;#39;t insure me you ask them</text>
  <text start="2831.2" dur="4.32">that you say to the power company do you</text>
  <text start="2833.599" dur="4.441">have insurance that protects me from</text>
  <text start="2835.52" dur="5.099">fire caused by this meter oh no even</text>
  <text start="2838.04" dur="4.62">Lloyd&amp;#39;s of London won&amp;#39;t insure against</text>
  <text start="2840.619" dur="5.041">that nobody will insure against that you</text>
  <text start="2842.66" dur="4.8">cannot get insurance for that and so</text>
  <text start="2845.66" dur="3.39">we&amp;#39;re putting a fire hazard on your home</text>
  <text start="2847.46" dur="4.35">that not only you don&amp;#39;t have insurance</text>
  <text start="2849.05" dur="5.46">for but you can&amp;#39;t even get insurance for</text>
  <text start="2851.81" dur="7.14">because the insurance companies know it</text>
  <text start="2854.51" dur="7.32">will burn if it gets a surge which are</text>
  <text start="2858.95" dur="4.56">very common so it&amp;#39;s crazy you know that</text>
  <text start="2861.83" dur="3.9">that they&amp;#39;re trying to get us to accept</text>
  <text start="2863.51" dur="5.01">something when there&amp;#39;s not even a way to</text>
  <text start="2865.73" dur="6.3">insure it because it&amp;#39;s so dangerous so</text>
  <text start="2868.52" dur="6.54">so the search protector issue what I</text>
  <text start="2872.03" dur="5.19">suggest people do call their company and</text>
  <text start="2875.06" dur="3.45">go through this level of you know</text>
  <text start="2877.22" dur="4.41">determining is there a surge protector</text>
  <text start="2878.51" dur="4.349">will it withstand a surge that about no</text>
  <text start="2881.63" dur="4.95">is the answer if it&amp;#39;s an electronic</text>
  <text start="2882.859" dur="6.901">meter and then you say well you need to</text>
  <text start="2886.58" dur="4.55">install a surge protector upstream above</text>
  <text start="2889.76" dur="4.68">my meter now you could get an</text>
  <text start="2891.13" dur="4.69">independent surge protector separate</text>
  <text start="2894.44" dur="4.14">from the utility meter it could be a</text>
  <text start="2895.82" dur="4.62">little gadget this big and they could</text>
  <text start="2898.58" dur="5.49">have just install it in line above the</text>
  <text start="2900.44" dur="7.169">meter but the difficulty here is that it</text>
  <text start="2904.07" dur="6.029">has to be on the power company side of</text>
  <text start="2907.609" dur="4.321">the meter you know it obviously has to</text>
  <text start="2910.099" dur="5.371">catch the surge before it gets to the</text>
  <text start="2911.93" dur="6.24">meter so they&amp;#39;re gonna resist that to</text>
  <text start="2915.47" dur="5.22">the bitter end but what I would suggest</text>
  <text start="2918.17" dur="4.38">and what we&amp;#39;re getting some</text>
  <text start="2920.69" dur="4.5">documentation together to serve notice</text>
  <text start="2922.55" dur="5.91">on the power companies saying if you</text>
  <text start="2925.19" dur="6.33">refuse to provide a surge protector and</text>
  <text start="2928.46" dur="6.81">if you cannot do it cannot assure me</text>
  <text start="2931.52" dur="6.72">that the meter is surge protected then I</text>
  <text start="2935.27" dur="6.39">will purchase a surge protector myself I</text>
  <text start="2938.24" dur="5.46">will have my electrician at my expense</text>
  <text start="2941.66" dur="4.679">install it</text>
  <text start="2943.7" dur="5.55">but you need to cooperate and simply</text>
  <text start="2946.339" dur="5.76">shut off the electricity one day while</text>
  <text start="2949.25" dur="5.82">that electrician installs that meter and</text>
  <text start="2952.099" dur="4.921">you have no expense and now you are</text>
  <text start="2955.07" dur="3.96">indemnified against burning my house</text>
  <text start="2957.02" dur="4.02">down because now we&amp;#39;ve got our surge</text>
  <text start="2959.03" dur="5.66">protector in place and you haven&amp;#39;t paid</text>
  <text start="2961.04" dur="7.02">for it I have and it sounds very unfair</text>
  <text start="2964.69" dur="5.56">but what else are you going to do if the</text>
  <text start="2968.06" dur="4.41">power company refuses you know you can</text>
  <text start="2970.25" dur="4.349">send a bill to the power company for the</text>
  <text start="2972.47" dur="3.84">surge protector you had to install and</text>
  <text start="2974.599" dur="4.23">the electricians fee you had to install</text>
  <text start="2976.31" dur="5.64">and you can say well you owe me this</text>
  <text start="2978.829" dur="5.581">good luck suing your power company for</text>
  <text start="2981.95" dur="5.07">that but but you know you have the</text>
  <text start="2984.41" dur="5.22">commercial lien process you know it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3067.3" dur="6.33">we&amp;#39;re like a hundred times higher than</text>
  <text start="3069.64" dur="5.219">Russia you know it&amp;#39;s crazy 20 to 100</text>
  <text start="3073.63" dur="3.57">times I can remember the exact amount</text>
  <text start="3074.859" dur="5.22">but it&amp;#39;s huge magnitude so</text>
  <text start="3077.2" dur="5.43">so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re controlled by a lot of</text>
  <text start="3080.079" dur="6.111">corruption in terms of our public</text>
  <text start="3082.63" dur="6.63">protection of this but on the other side</text>
  <text start="3086.19" dur="7.389">people are howling about it everywhere</text>
  <text start="3089.26" dur="6.96">and about 15 to 20 percent of the</text>
  <text start="3093.579" dur="4.651">population is electromagnetic sensitive</text>
  <text start="3096.22" dur="2.94">and they don&amp;#39;t even many don&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="3098.23" dur="2.79">it they don&amp;#39;t know why they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="3099.16" dur="3.33">sick they just figure it&amp;#39;s like their</text>
  <text start="3101.02" dur="4.29">time or they&amp;#39;re getting old or whatever</text>
  <text start="3102.49" dur="5.46">their electromagnetic sensitive and and</text>
  <text start="3105.31" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s like an allergy to radio</text>
  <text start="3107.95" dur="7.46">frequencies or an allergy to electric</text>
  <text start="3110.71" dur="7.74">fields and so we have had such bad</text>
  <text start="3115.41" dur="5.86">public education on this that people</text>
  <text start="3118.45" dur="4.11">literally have no idea why they feel bad</text>
  <text start="3121.27" dur="3">or what makes them sick and then they</text>
  <text start="3122.56" dur="4.08">say you know I just can&amp;#39;t use a cell</text>
  <text start="3124.27" dur="4.8">phone I can&amp;#39;t use a computer for very</text>
  <text start="3126.64" dur="4.41">long I can&amp;#39;t do this I can&amp;#39;t do and they</text>
  <text start="3129.07" dur="3.779">don&amp;#39;t know why well your electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="3131.05" dur="5.52">sensitive you&amp;#39;re gonna get worse and</text>
  <text start="3132.849" dur="5.071">worse because there&amp;#39;s never been in all</text>
  <text start="3136.57" dur="3.029">of human history a flood of</text>
  <text start="3137.92" dur="2.01">electromagnetic radiation like we&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="3139.599" dur="2.881">doing</text>
  <text start="3139.93" dur="5.399">how many wireless devices do they have</text>
  <text start="3142.48" dur="4.889">now and this doesn&amp;#39;t even include what</text>
  <text start="3145.329" dur="3.54">the government uses to communicate with</text>

  <text start="3162.76" dur="4.559">let&amp;#39;s have a couple extras cordless</text>

  <text start="3167.319" dur="4.201">you&amp;#39;re just baking with this and if your</text>
  <text start="3169.51" dur="3.359">electromagnetic sensitive I talked to</text>
  <text start="3171.52" dur="3.42">these people on the phone they call me</text>
  <text start="3172.869" dur="4.171">from my videos and they just say I just</text>
  <text start="3174.94" dur="4.02">threw out every gadget I had and then</text>
  <text start="3177.04" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re throwing a you know a couple of</text>
  <text start="3178.96" dur="3.869">thousand dollars worth of gadgets</text>
  <text start="3180.609" dur="2.791">because they realize holy cow I feel so</text>
  <text start="3182.829" dur="2.51">much better</text>
  <text start="3183.4" dur="6.63">when I turn all this stuff off and</text>
  <text start="3185.339" dur="7.091">feeling better when you feel better it</text>
  <text start="3190.03" dur="6.539">means you&amp;#39;re not getting cancer as fast</text>
  <text start="3192.43" dur="6.81">you know it it matters so so you know</text>
  <text start="3196.569" dur="4.981">this is this is you know something that</text>
  <text start="3199.24" dur="5.48">the public is going to become much more</text>
  <text start="3201.55" dur="5.67">aware of whether or not anybody tries to</text>
  <text start="3204.72" dur="4.119">get this information out or not I mean</text>
  <text start="3207.22" dur="2.879">you don&amp;#39;t have a choice so when you have</text>
  <text start="3208.839" dur="2.43">fifteen to twenty percent of the</text>
  <text start="3210.099" dur="3.69">population that are alike</text>
  <text start="3211.269" dur="5.13">magnetic sensitive and electromagnetic</text>
  <text start="3213.789" dur="4.56">sensitivity is cumulative when you get</text>
  <text start="3216.399" dur="4.02">more exposure and we&amp;#39;re all getting more</text>
  <text start="3218.349" dur="4.08">exposure and people who are not</text>
  <text start="3220.419" dur="4.29">electromagnetic sensitive at all</text>
  <text start="3222.429" dur="5.79">turn electromagnetic sensitive when they</text>
  <text start="3224.709" dur="5.4">get certain levels of exposure but it</text>
  <text start="3228.219" dur="3.57">looks to me obviously five or ten years</text>
  <text start="3230.109" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;ve got fifty percent of the</text>
  <text start="3231.789" dur="4.53">population can&amp;#39;t be around electronic</text>
  <text start="3233.979" dur="4.53">gadgets and this is very difficult I</text>
  <text start="3236.319" dur="3.87">mean I talk to people who want to fix</text>
  <text start="3238.509" dur="4.621">things but they can&amp;#39;t even go on the</text>
  <text start="3240.189" dur="4.86">internet to search for something because</text>
  <text start="3243.13" dur="3.51">they can&amp;#39;t sit down at a computer and</text>
  <text start="3245.049" dur="3.06">they have to say well tell my friend</text>
  <text start="3246.64" dur="3.029">what to search for and tell me where I</text>
  <text start="3248.109" dur="3.781">can buy it or do it you know how I can</text>
  <text start="3249.669" dur="4.23">find out more about it&amp;#39;s very sad and</text>
  <text start="3251.89" dur="4.619">and when you can&amp;#39;t even access a</text>
  <text start="3253.899" dur="4.35">computer you know this is probably the</text>
  <text start="3256.509" dur="4.621">level now what you&amp;#39;d call extreme hyper</text>
  <text start="3258.249" dur="4.381">sensitivity but but that is where we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3261.13" dur="3.959">all headed if we don&amp;#39;t reduce our</text>
  <text start="3262.63" dur="6.779">exposures and if we don&amp;#39;t get educated</text>
  <text start="3265.089" dur="5.82">on how to protect ourselves so I imagine</text>
  <text start="3269.409" dur="3.42">at this point most people have a smart</text>
  <text start="3270.909" dur="5.43">Peter but now or a electronic meter but</text>
  <text start="3272.829" dur="6.301">is there an easy way to tell yes if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3276.339" dur="6.15">got this digital face you know like a</text>
  <text start="3279.13" dur="6.029">clock radio the electromechanical meters</text>
  <text start="3282.489" dur="4.46">have some kind of mechanical device that</text>
  <text start="3285.159" dur="4.11">you know you&amp;#39;ll see the spinning ring</text>
  <text start="3286.949" dur="5.56">that kind of sticks out a little bit and</text>
  <text start="3289.269" dur="5.37">then you&amp;#39;ll see five dials and and their</text>
  <text start="3292.509" dur="4.2">mechanical sometimes it&amp;#39;s like an</text>
  <text start="3294.639" dur="4.41">odometer a little different</text>
  <text start="3296.709" dur="4.35">configuration but it&amp;#39;s mechanical an</text>
  <text start="3299.049" dur="3.24">electromechanical meter which is the</text>
  <text start="3301.059" dur="5">good kind that you want</text>
  <text start="3302.289" dur="5.94">electromechanical electronic is bad</text>
  <text start="3306.059" dur="5.98">electromechanical is good that&amp;#39;s how you</text>
  <text start="3308.229" dur="6.75">refer to electric utility meters if you</text>
  <text start="3312.039" dur="5.91">have the electromechanical meter you can</text>
  <text start="3314.979" dur="4.29">see right through it you can see all the</text>
  <text start="3317.949" dur="3.45">components in there there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="3319.269" dur="5.37">electronics there&amp;#39;s no circuit boards</text>
  <text start="3321.399" dur="5.27">nothing but some kind of heavy bars and</text>
  <text start="3324.639" dur="6.03">wheels and years</text>
  <text start="3326.669" dur="5.2">it&amp;#39;s electromechanical when you have</text>

  <text start="3333.099" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s a little window with a clock radio</text>
  <text start="3335.559" dur="6.78">thing type of numbers LED display</text>
  <text start="3339.069" dur="4.94">numbers or even when you see a part of</text>
  <text start="3342.339" dur="2.911">the meter that you can&amp;#39;t see through</text>
  <text start="3344.009" dur="3.191">that</text>
  <text start="3345.25" dur="5.79">electronic meter there&amp;#39;s a meter company</text>
  <text start="3347.2" dur="7.2">by the name of Landis gir l AMD is Gyr</text>
  <text start="3351.04" dur="5.64">and they make an imposter meter a Trojan</text>
  <text start="3354.4" dur="2.85">horse meter and this is proof that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3356.68" dur="3.78">harmful</text>
  <text start="3357.25" dur="5.22">why hide what it&amp;#39;s doing if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3360.46" dur="4.68">harmful they make a meter that looks</text>
  <text start="3362.47" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an imposter it&amp;#39;s designed to</text>
  <text start="3365.14" dur="3.48">look like an electromechanical meter</text>
  <text start="3367.15" dur="4.8">with a spinning wheel and the whole deal</text>
  <text start="3368.62" dur="6">and there&amp;#39;s a bottom you know pie shade</text>
  <text start="3371.95" dur="5.22">thing or crescent shaped part of it</text>
  <text start="3374.62" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s encased in plastic that you</text>
  <text start="3377.17" dur="3.81">cannot see through and they&amp;#39;ve hidden</text>
  <text start="3379.36" dur="4.41">all the electronic components in there</text>
  <text start="3380.98" dur="6.05">it&amp;#39;s a totally smart meter type device</text>
  <text start="3383.77" dur="6.57">made camouflage to look like an</text>
  <text start="3387.03" dur="8.32">electromechanical analog meter and that</text>
  <text start="3390.34" dur="7.8">to me is a bald omission admission that</text>
  <text start="3395.35" dur="4.53">this is a harmful device that this is</text>
  <text start="3398.14" dur="3.36">something we have to hide this is</text>
  <text start="3399.88" dur="4.83">something that we&amp;#39;re doing something</text>
  <text start="3401.5" dur="5.43">wrong it&amp;#39;s obviously clear why would you</text>
  <text start="3404.71" dur="6.03">hide it if it wasn&amp;#39;t in some way harmful</text>
  <text start="3406.93" dur="5.52">so Landis Gurr decided to hide it so you</text>
  <text start="3410.74" dur="3.42">know that to me that said everything</text>
  <text start="3412.45" dur="5.54">right there and there&amp;#39;s other there are</text>
  <text start="3414.16" dur="7.26">other utility companies or rather</text>
  <text start="3417.99" dur="5.94">utility meter manufacturers that do that</text>
  <text start="3421.42" dur="6.36">that hide electronic components and</text>
  <text start="3423.93" dur="6.91">present the meter to look like a an</text>
  <text start="3427.78" dur="5.84">analog meter so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="3430.84" dur="5.61">minefield out there you could have a</text>
  <text start="3433.62" dur="5.41">electronic meter and think you had a an</text>
  <text start="3436.45" dur="3.93">electromechanical meter it&amp;#39;s very you</text>
  <text start="3439.03" dur="2.88">got to kind of pay attention if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3440.38" dur="4.52">any part of that meter that you cannot</text>
  <text start="3441.91" dur="7.47">see through you probably have a problem</text>
  <text start="3444.9" dur="6.58">alright well I think we&amp;#39;ve covered most</text>
  <text start="3449.38" dur="3.81">of it Theriot is there anything else you</text>
  <text start="3451.48" dur="4.26">wanted to add and also where can people</text>
  <text start="3453.19" dur="4.29">you know your websites and stuff again</text>
