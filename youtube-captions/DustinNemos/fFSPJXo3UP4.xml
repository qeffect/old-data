  <text start="128.679" dur="5.971">that mantra to a whole new level saying</text>
  <text start="131.11" dur="5.31">basically go bold or die extinction</text>
  <text start="134.65" dur="4.199">rebellion has now developed into a</text>
  <text start="136.42" dur="5.13">well-organized worldwide protest</text>
  <text start="138.849" dur="4.86">enabling them to disrupt major cities</text>
  <text start="141.55" dur="4.38">across the globe including an airport in</text>
  <text start="143.709" dur="4.951">London and Times Square in New York City</text>
  <text start="145.93" dur="4.83">before we get into that though I want to</text>
  <text start="148.66" dur="5.01">highlight this major scandal coming out</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="5.1">of Arizona so this is coming from the</text>
  <text start="153.67" dur="4.59">chicago tribune politician charged the</text>
  <text start="155.86" dur="5.219">human trafficking adoption scheme Paul</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="4.98">Peterson is an Arizona elected official</text>
  <text start="161.079" dur="4.051">he&amp;#39;s a Republican mind you</text>
  <text start="163.24" dur="4.29">corruption has nothing to do with your</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="4.59">political affiliation you could be an</text>
  <text start="167.53" dur="4.29">independent you could be a Democrat you</text>
  <text start="169.72" dur="5.16">could be a Republican it does not matter</text>
  <text start="171.82" dur="6.18">if you&amp;#39;re a corrupt person you are a</text>
  <text start="174.88" dur="7.92">corrupt person this person is hugely</text>
  <text start="178" dur="7.59">corrupt so Paul Peterson he was involved</text>
  <text start="182.8" dur="5.34">in a smuggling scheme where they</text>
  <text start="185.59" dur="4.8">recruited pregnant women from the</text>
  <text start="188.14" dur="5.58">Pacific Islands specifically the</text>
  <text start="190.39" dur="10.67">Marshall Islands likely because he was</text>
  <text start="193.72" dur="11.16">fluent in marshalese now this involves</text>
  <text start="201.06" dur="8.82">75 adoptions over a period of three</text>
  <text start="204.88" dur="8.57">years and he made a lot of money on this</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="7.21">he promised to pay each of these women</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="5.98">$10,000 plus pay for their expenses to</text>
  <text start="217.09" dur="4.65">the US including transportation legal</text>
  <text start="219.43" dur="4.71">documents and then he housed them well</text>
  <text start="221.74" dur="5.76">he housed them in what court documents</text>
  <text start="224.14" dur="5.01">described as baby mills and the women</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="4.62">who were staying there had to sleep on</text>
  <text start="229.15" dur="5.04">either very small mattresses or the bare</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="4.95">floor and they were not receiving any</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="6.06">prenatal care whatsoever and a lot of</text>
  <text start="237.07" dur="7.44">the times they would be sent back to the</text>
  <text start="240.25" dur="8.51">Marshall Islands now he&amp;#39;s being charged</text>
  <text start="244.51" dur="6.81">in Utah Arizona and Arkansas in Utah</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="4.84">this is where this probe picked up</text>
  <text start="251.32" dur="7.11">because in hospitals they had noted that</text>
  <text start="253.6" dur="8.37">there is a major uptick in marshalese</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="7.98">births and then those women would fly</text>
  <text start="261.97" dur="8.88">back home so that&amp;#39;s when they started an</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="10.31">investigation into this the link with</text>
  <text start="270.85" dur="9.39">Arkansas is interesting to me and also</text>
  <text start="276.72" dur="7.93">in Arkansas they have a huge</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="6.69">concentration of marshalese immigrants</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="4.65">and a lot of times they report that</text>
  <text start="286.93" dur="4.85">women marshalese women who give birth</text>
  <text start="289.3" dur="5.33">they then go back to their Island</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="6.15">afterwards</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="5.54">when I think of Arkansas and I&amp;#39;m sure a</text>
  <text start="297.93" dur="4.86">lot of you listening also do this too</text>
  <text start="300.17" dur="5.8">when I think of Arkansas I immediately</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="6.57">think of the Clintons oh and with</text>
  <text start="305.97" dur="7.47">Arizona I immediately think of McCain</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="5.55">and the McCain Institute when I think of</text>
  <text start="313.44" dur="2.61">the Clintons I think of the Clinton</text>
  <text start="314.91" dur="3.45">Foundation and the Clinton Global</text>
  <text start="316.05" dur="5.12">Initiative organizations that are</text>
  <text start="318.36" dur="8.85">involved in child trafficking</text>
  <text start="321.17" dur="7.6">internationally so I would be interested</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="3.69">I&amp;#39;m going to have to do some more</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="6.57">digging and I will give more updates as</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="8.9">they come up but I would be not really</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="6.99">surprised if there is a link between</text>
  <text start="339.8" dur="4.12">this operation and the Clinton</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="6.15">Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative</text>
  <text start="343.92" dur="8.73">or even the McCain Institute but this</text>
  <text start="348.48" dur="9.8">man Paul Peterson in 1998 when he was a</text>
  <text start="352.65" dur="11.1">senior at ASU he was recruited by an</text>
  <text start="358.28" dur="8.35">international adoption agency Children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="9.45">Home international because he was fluent</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="8.64">in marshalese so I would like to know if</text>
  <text start="373.2" dur="6.06">that organization Children&amp;#39;s Home</text>
  <text start="375.27" dur="10.2">International is linked to the Clintons</text>
  <text start="379.26" dur="8.58">or the McCain&amp;#39;s in any way it seems</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="4.08">rather plausible so I&amp;#39;m gonna be digging</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="4.59">around in this and I will let you know</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="6.6">if I find anything and I would not be</text>
  <text start="392.43" dur="8.4">surprised if I did find something okay</text>
  <text start="396.15" dur="9.69">in other news the public charge rule was</text>
  <text start="400.83" dur="8.58">supposed to be in effect and then judges</text>
  <text start="405.84" dur="8.19">have blocked it so the public charge</text>
  <text start="409.41" dur="6.06">rule limits immigrants who want to come</text>
  <text start="414.03" dur="5.04">to this country and get a green card or</text>
  <text start="415.47" dur="7.83">a visa if they are going to be a public</text>
  <text start="419.07" dur="6.93">charge then they can be denied and this</text>
  <text start="423.3" dur="4.32">is actually very practical</text>
  <text start="426" dur="4.5">because we don&amp;#39;t have unlimited</text>
  <text start="427.62" dur="5.55">resources we don&amp;#39;t even have the</text>
  <text start="430.5" dur="4.92">resources I guess to even take care of</text>
  <text start="433.17" dur="8.04">our own that is why we have a huge</text>
  <text start="435.42" dur="9.06">homelessness crisis here so we cannot</text>
  <text start="441.21" dur="6.93">afford to extend these resources to</text>
  <text start="444.48" dur="10.04">those who are not even a citizen of this</text>
  <text start="448.14" dur="10.89">country or even to open our doors to</text>
  <text start="454.52" dur="7.99">newcomers if you are coming here you</text>
  <text start="459.03" dur="6.66">need to be able to show that you are</text>
  <text start="462.51" dur="6.26">going to be self-sustainable that you</text>
  <text start="465.69" dur="5.64">will be a productive member of society</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="5.71">so judges now have blocked this</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="7.56">regulation and of course it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="6.36">surprise so a judge from Manhattan had</text>
  <text start="478.89" dur="3.3">issued a preliminary nationwide</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="2.73">injunction prohibiting the</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="4.26">administration from enforcing the</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="5.75">so-called public charge rule just days</text>
  <text start="486.45" dur="6.75">before it was slated to take effect in</text>
  <text start="489.32" dur="5.71">addition to that San Francisco has also</text>
  <text start="493.2" dur="3.18">said that they will not enforce the rule</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="3.9">within the jurisdiction of the Ninth</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="4.62">Circuit Court of Appeals of course</text>
  <text start="498.93" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s not a surprise either also</text>
  <text start="501" dur="6.72">Washington State has also blocked the</text>
  <text start="503.49" dur="7.29">regulation nationwide so they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="5.28">that they are faulting the government</text>
  <text start="510.78" dur="3.84">for not adequately explaining why it was</text>
  <text start="513" dur="3.96">changing the definition of a public</text>
  <text start="514.62" dur="5.49">charge or why the change was needed and</text>
  <text start="516.96" dur="5.639">he said quote the rule is simply a new</text>
  <text start="520.11" dur="4.77">agency policy of exclusion in search of</text>
  <text start="522.599" dur="3.931">a justification is repugnant to the</text>
  <text start="524.88" dur="3.45">American dream of the opportunity for</text>
  <text start="526.53" dur="4.73">prosperity and success through hard work</text>
  <text start="528.33" dur="9.03">and upwards mobility end quote</text>
  <text start="531.26" dur="10.24">now this is very contradictory here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.36" dur="7.02">the thing if you&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="5.49">American dream of opportunity through</text>
  <text start="544.38" dur="10.1">hard work and upwards mobility you</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="7.49">cannot be defending the use of welfare</text>
  <text start="555.2" dur="3.45">if</text>
  <text start="556.7" dur="4.23">someone is coming to this country and</text>
  <text start="558.65" dur="4.47">they want the opportunity for the</text>
  <text start="560.93" dur="5.25">American dream sure you can have it but</text>
  <text start="563.12" dur="6.72">you got to work for it like everyone</text>
  <text start="566.18" dur="5.82">else if you are coming here and then</text>
  <text start="569.84" dur="2.61">getting welfare that is not the American</text>
  <text start="572" dur="5.88">dream</text>
  <text start="572.45" dur="9.48">you are now in a trap of poverty that is</text>
  <text start="577.88" dur="6.06">very difficult to get out of and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="581.93" dur="6.24">designed to be difficult to get out of</text>
  <text start="583.94" dur="6.84">because the Democrats who are advocates</text>
  <text start="588.17" dur="5.43">for welfare they want people to be</text>
  <text start="590.78" dur="8.73">dependent on them that is how they get</text>
  <text start="593.6" dur="11.58">their power they need people to need</text>
  <text start="599.51" dur="9.87">them that&amp;#39;s why they support welfare so</text>
  <text start="605.18" dur="7.86">strongly but welfare really just keeps</text>
  <text start="609.38" dur="9.63">people down I know because I had to claw</text>
  <text start="613.04" dur="12">my way out of that whole system it is a</text>
  <text start="619.01" dur="8.85">trap really so is not beneficial for</text>
  <text start="625.04" dur="7.59">immigrants to come here and get attached</text>
  <text start="627.86" dur="6.66">to welfare also like I said it is not</text>
  <text start="632.63" dur="5.07">beneficial to this country for us to</text>
  <text start="634.52" dur="9.27">expend resources that are already</text>
  <text start="637.7" dur="11.7">stretched thin Lee we cannot do that</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="9.17">because then it affects everyone that is</text>
  <text start="649.4" dur="10.07">why we have people still in the streets</text>
  <text start="652.96" dur="8.86">because we are not wise spenders at all</text>
  <text start="659.47" dur="4.63">we can&amp;#39;t even take care of our own</text>
  <text start="661.82" dur="7.83">people and we&amp;#39;re talking about bringing</text>
  <text start="664.1" dur="7.44">on new burdens no if you want to come to</text>
  <text start="669.65" dur="2.76">this country and be a productive member</text>
  <text start="671.54" dur="3.75">of society</text>
  <text start="672.41" dur="4.38">by all means definitely come here just</text>
  <text start="675.29" dur="4.89">like President Trump has said time and</text>
  <text start="676.79" dur="5.04">again immigrants contribute greatly to</text>
  <text start="680.18" dur="6.48">this country to the success of this</text>
  <text start="681.83" dur="8.759">country they do but those who are</text>
  <text start="686.66" dur="7.229">productive are the ones that really</text>
  <text start="690.589" dur="6.06">helped build this country not those who</text>
  <text start="693.889" dur="6.541">come here and become a public charge by</text>
  <text start="696.649" dur="5.67">using food stamps and cash assistance</text>
  <text start="700.43" dur="8.159">and Medicaid</text>
  <text start="702.319" dur="10.71">all of these welfare sources that are</text>
  <text start="708.589" dur="8.19">very costly to the taxpayer it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="713.029" dur="6.24">common sense but of course they are</text>
  <text start="716.779" dur="5.37">trying to block this on the grounds that</text>
  <text start="719.269" dur="4.351">it is discriminatory against people of</text>
  <text start="722.149" dur="6">color they&amp;#39;re saying it has to do with</text>
  <text start="723.62" dur="5.79">race and has nothing to do with race but</text>
  <text start="728.149" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s the card they like to pull all</text>
  <text start="729.41" dur="5.76">the time hopefully this will be appealed</text>
  <text start="732.589" dur="5.641">and it will be implemented properly at</text>
  <text start="735.17" dur="9.06">some point because this is just common</text>
  <text start="738.23" dur="9.18">sense okay in other news so I have been</text>
  <text start="744.23" dur="6.06">updating you guys on the cases because</text>
  <text start="747.41" dur="5.039">there are a few involving David daleiden</text>
  <text start="750.29" dur="4.229">and Sandra Merritt&amp;#39;s who are the</text>
  <text start="752.449" dur="6">investigative journalists behind the</text>
  <text start="754.519" dur="6.36">human capital project which is a series</text>
  <text start="758.449" dur="4.94">of videos that expose Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="760.879" dur="6.421">and others within the abortion industry</text>
  <text start="763.389" dur="6.31">for fetal trafficking and changing of</text>
  <text start="767.3" dur="4.68">medical procedures putting patients in</text>
  <text start="769.699" dur="7.801">danger and really all it is is for</text>
  <text start="771.98" dur="8.13">profit so the civil trial right now is</text>
  <text start="777.5" dur="5.839">ongoing it started on October 2nd and</text>
  <text start="780.11" dur="6.18">that is ongoing until November 15th and</text>
  <text start="783.339" dur="5.831">the civil trial they&amp;#39;re suing Sandra</text>
  <text start="786.29" dur="5.25">Merritt and David daleiden for millions</text>
  <text start="789.17" dur="4.5">of dollars trying to cripple them</text>
  <text start="791.54" dur="4.26">financially making an example out of</text>
  <text start="793.67" dur="5.039">them the prelim inant during the</text>
  <text start="795.8" dur="7.579">preliminary hearing for that a lot of</text>
  <text start="798.709" dur="7.68">information came out about the real</text>
  <text start="803.379" dur="5.231">purposes of the abortion industry and</text>
  <text start="806.389" dur="6.031">the horrors that are associated with</text>
  <text start="808.61" dur="7.86">that including the harvesting of beating</text>
  <text start="812.42" dur="7.169">heart from a live birth so a baby who is</text>
  <text start="816.47" dur="6.119">born alive during an abortion procedure</text>
  <text start="819.589" dur="5.24">they killed that baby by harvesting its</text>
  <text start="822.589" dur="2.24">heart</text>
  <text start="825.16" dur="7.48">this is hugely wrong very illegal</text>
  <text start="828.68" dur="7.41">unethical just wrong and so all of this</text>
  <text start="832.64" dur="5.82">information needs to be exposed to the</text>
  <text start="836.09" dur="3.93">public the public who believes that</text>
  <text start="838.46" dur="4.53">Planned Parenthood is a benevolent</text>
  <text start="840.02" dur="6.15">organization who is focused on women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="842.99" dur="6.26">rights and access of reproductive health</text>
  <text start="846.17" dur="7.95">care for everyone that is not the case</text>
  <text start="849.25" dur="6.13">they are a human trafficking because</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s what these babies are they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="855.38" dur="7.22">humans they&amp;#39;re preborn humans they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="857.3" dur="8.96">humans that are not born yet so they are</text>
  <text start="862.6" dur="8.68">trafficking human baby parts for</text>
  <text start="866.26" dur="7">significant profits and they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="871.28" dur="4.23">who they have to exploit to accomplish</text>
  <text start="873.26" dur="4.2">this so all of that was exposed in the</text>
  <text start="875.51" dur="4.77">preliminary hearing now during the civil</text>
  <text start="877.46" dur="5.19">trial they the judge who is affiliated</text>
  <text start="880.28" dur="4.8">with Planned Parenthood he is not</text>
  <text start="882.65" dur="6.92">allowing the video evidence to be seen</text>
  <text start="885.08" dur="7.56">by the jury which really skews the case</text>
  <text start="889.57" dur="5.23">which is very unfortunate so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="892.64" dur="5.25">fighting very hard in that civil trial</text>
  <text start="894.8" dur="5.43">now the criminal trial trial they just</text>
  <text start="897.89" dur="4.26">finished up the preliminary hearing for</text>
  <text start="900.23" dur="4.11">that they will make a decision on</text>
  <text start="902.15" dur="4.17">October 22nd whether or not they will</text>
  <text start="904.34" dur="3.69">move forward with the criminal charges</text>
  <text start="906.32" dur="4.62">and of course the criminal charges there</text>
  <text start="908.03" dur="4.83">are there were 15 but then now there are</text>
  <text start="910.94" dur="7.05">14 charges one of those charges was</text>
  <text start="912.86" dur="8.07">dropped 14 felony charges one charge</text>
  <text start="917.99" dur="5.6">each for each person that was recorded</text>
  <text start="920.93" dur="5.63">if they&amp;#39;re found guilty they could face</text>
  <text start="923.59" dur="6.82">significant amount of time in prison</text>
  <text start="926.56" dur="6.01">this is a big deal so the preliminary</text>
  <text start="930.41" dur="4.47">hearing just finished up and during that</text>
  <text start="932.57" dur="4.74">preliminary hearing the California</text>
  <text start="934.88" dur="6.09">Attorney General had said that</text>
  <text start="937.31" dur="7.11">infanticide is not a crime after failed</text>
  <text start="940.97" dur="10.2">abortion so what they&amp;#39;re saying here is</text>
  <text start="944.42" dur="8.97">that this unborn baby is not considered</text>
  <text start="951.17" dur="5.94">a human being that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="953.39" dur="7.88">so I would like to ask them at</text>
  <text start="957.11" dur="6.57">point is this baby considered a human</text>
  <text start="961.27" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re saying that it&amp;#39;s after birth</text>
  <text start="963.68" dur="10.2">what is it beforehand is it not a person</text>
  <text start="967.3" dur="10.87">and so a part of that argument they said</text>
  <text start="973.88" dur="7.71">that as a matter of statutory definition</text>
  <text start="978.17" dur="5.58">however a fetus is not a person and does</text>
  <text start="981.59" dur="6.12">not come within the exception found</text>
  <text start="983.75" dur="7.77">within Penal Code section 633 5 the</text>
  <text start="987.71" dur="5.97">brief cites People vs dennis 1998 which</text>
  <text start="991.52" dur="4.26">observes that quote a fetus is not a</text>
  <text start="993.68" dur="3.69">human being or a person within the</text>
  <text start="995.78" dur="4.08">meaning of the murder statute or any</text>
  <text start="997.37" dur="4.32">other penal code provision such as</text>
  <text start="999.86" dur="4.35">manslaughter vehicular manslaughter or</text>
  <text start="1001.69" dur="5.46">sections 633 point 5 for that matter</text>
  <text start="1004.21" dur="4.77">unless expressly so provided by the</text>
  <text start="1007.15" dur="9.45">legislature end quote</text>
  <text start="1008.98" dur="9.42">and also they were saying that babies</text>
  <text start="1016.6" dur="4.35">who survived abortion aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1018.4" dur="4.8">resuscitated as the law requires if</text>
  <text start="1020.95" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s not what the mother and family</text>
  <text start="1023.2" dur="4.62">wants so the mother and family gets this</text>
  <text start="1025.42" dur="8.4">gets to decide whether or not this child</text>
  <text start="1027.82" dur="8.129">lives they also continue to say that the</text>
  <text start="1033.82" dur="3.75">way these people feel is that once the</text>
  <text start="1035.949" dur="5.131">woman wants the child aborted the child</text>
  <text start="1037.57" dur="9.68">is not a child what are you talking</text>
  <text start="1041.08" dur="6.17">about and I know I&amp;#39;ve said this before</text>
  <text start="1047.58" dur="7.39">if that woman cannot will herself to be</text>
  <text start="1052.54" dur="4.86">pregnant now I&amp;#39;m talking about we see</text>
  <text start="1054.97" dur="6.77">lots of examples of women who have to go</text>
  <text start="1057.4" dur="6.54">through years of trying to have a baby</text>
  <text start="1061.74" dur="3.85">years of trying to have it they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1063.94" dur="3.39">just will themselves pregnant like</text>
  <text start="1065.59" dur="4.05">snapping their fingers like that it</text>
  <text start="1067.33" dur="7.73">doesn&amp;#39;t work because they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1069.64" dur="10.08">not God right so if you cannot will a</text>
  <text start="1075.06" dur="6.19">baby to be alive in your stomach if you</text>
  <text start="1079.72" dur="4.26">cannot will yourself pregnant if you</text>
  <text start="1081.25" dur="5.79">cannot will that baby into being you do</text>
  <text start="1083.98" dur="4.84">not have the authority to will that baby</text>
  <text start="1087.04" dur="5.21">to death</text>
  <text start="1088.82" dur="5.79">you do not have that authority I felt</text>
  <text start="1092.25" dur="6.059">very strongly about this</text>
  <text start="1094.61" dur="5.26">just because a woman no longer wants</text>
  <text start="1098.309" dur="8.101">that child that does not mean that child</text>
  <text start="1099.87" dur="10.05">is not a child anymore a child is a</text>
  <text start="1106.41" dur="11.82">child no matter what that is truth that</text>
  <text start="1109.92" dur="12.84">is a fact and you cannot change it so</text>
  <text start="1118.23" dur="8.31">they&amp;#39;re trying to justify the fact that</text>
  <text start="1122.76" dur="6.87">they harvested these organs out of</text>
  <text start="1126.54" dur="5.16">living babies because these babies were</text>
  <text start="1129.63" dur="5.549">born alive and they did this on purpose</text>
  <text start="1131.7" dur="5.13">and these videos expose that how they</text>
  <text start="1135.179" dur="6.481">did this on purpose for a specific</text>
  <text start="1136.83" dur="9.72">purpose they needed organs that were</text>
  <text start="1141.66" dur="9.62">harvested live so they cut those organs</text>
  <text start="1146.55" dur="4.73">from a living baby from live births in</text>
  <text start="1153.11" dur="5.73">addition to all the other unethical</text>
  <text start="1155.25" dur="3.59">illegal practices that they committed</text>
  <text start="1159.02" dur="3.4">however they&amp;#39;re not the ones who are on</text>
  <text start="1161.7" dur="2.79">trial here</text>
  <text start="1162.42" dur="6.69">it&amp;#39;s these investigative journalists who</text>
  <text start="1164.49" dur="6.18">expose them so I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before but</text>
  <text start="1169.11" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m gonna say it again especially for</text>
  <text start="1170.67" dur="3.54">anyone here who&amp;#39;s new listening at us</text>
  <text start="1172.35" dur="4.53">but this case is very important these</text>
  <text start="1174.21" dur="4.77">cases because there are a few ongoing</text>
  <text start="1176.88" dur="3.33">right now we have the civil trials where</text>
  <text start="1178.98" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re trying to cripple them</text>
  <text start="1180.21" dur="4.23">financially and then we also have the</text>
  <text start="1182.16" dur="4.79">criminal trials where this could result</text>
  <text start="1184.44" dur="6.81">in prison time very bad</text>
  <text start="1186.95" dur="6.49">these cases are important because this</text>
  <text start="1191.25" dur="4.58">carries significant implications for</text>
  <text start="1193.44" dur="8.55">investigative journalism number one</text>
  <text start="1195.83" dur="10.36">where in the future journalists will be</text>
  <text start="1201.99" dur="6.87">deterred from reporting on corruption</text>
  <text start="1206.19" dur="4.65">that involves very powerful</text>
  <text start="1208.86" dur="5.4">organizations or individuals for fear of</text>
  <text start="1210.84" dur="8.1">the repercussions number two and most</text>
  <text start="1214.26" dur="7.2">importantly is that this</text>
  <text start="1218.94" dur="5.699">should be exposing Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1221.46" dur="7.409">and any other organization involved in</text>
  <text start="1224.639" dur="5.49">the abortion industry the abortion</text>
  <text start="1228.869" dur="3.831">industry as a whole</text>
  <text start="1230.129" dur="4.561">anyone who provides abortions any</text>
  <text start="1232.7" dur="9.399">organization who is involved in this</text>
  <text start="1234.69" dur="13.469">this is not a benevolent industry it has</text>
  <text start="1242.099" dur="11.16">to be shut down they are committing</text>
  <text start="1248.159" dur="8.73">crimes against humanity they cannot be</text>
  <text start="1253.259" dur="5.16">allowed to continue and this is</text>
  <text start="1256.889" dur="3.84">especially important right now</text>
  <text start="1258.419" dur="3.62">because Planned Parenthood is not</text>
  <text start="1260.729" dur="5.69">backing down</text>
  <text start="1262.039" dur="8.921">they are ramping up their efforts to</text>
  <text start="1266.419" dur="8.07">boost their own image to sway the public</text>
  <text start="1270.96" dur="4.769">opinion they already have a program with</text>
  <text start="1274.489" dur="5.17">billboard</text>
  <text start="1275.729" dur="9.9">so Billboard has 141 artists signed on</text>
  <text start="1279.659" dur="9.57">to this bands off my bands where they</text>
  <text start="1285.629" dur="7.02">donate a significant portion of their</text>
  <text start="1289.229" dur="6.51">proceeds from concert shows to Planned</text>
  <text start="1292.649" dur="5.01">Parenthood oh but they&amp;#39;re so hurting for</text>
  <text start="1295.739" dur="2.64">money because they don&amp;#39;t have title 10</text>
  <text start="1297.659" dur="3.87">funding anymore</text>
  <text start="1298.379" dur="5.701">they rejected title 10 funding because</text>
  <text start="1301.529" dur="5.97">they refused to separate the abortion</text>
  <text start="1304.08" dur="8.519">practices from their normal practices</text>
  <text start="1307.499" dur="9.39">and they in fact shut down two clinics</text>
  <text start="1312.599" dur="6.21">that didn&amp;#39;t even offer abortions but</text>
  <text start="1316.889" dur="5.311">we&amp;#39;re actually for reproductive services</text>
  <text start="1318.809" dur="7.94">reproductive health they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1322.2" dur="8.189">about reproductive health that is a sham</text>
  <text start="1326.749" dur="6.64">that is a cover they do not care about</text>
  <text start="1330.389" dur="5.431">women&amp;#39;s reproductive rights it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="1333.389" dur="5.701">way for them to be supported by the</text>
  <text start="1335.82" dur="6.27">public because it sounds good Oh women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1339.09" dur="6.36">rights it&amp;#39;s about access to reproductive</text>
  <text start="1342.09" dur="7.259">health care notice they emphasize health</text>
  <text start="1345.45" dur="4.95">care abortions they that&amp;#39;s not health</text>
  <text start="1349.349" dur="6.451">care</text>
  <text start="1350.4" dur="7.409">I saw in another article where they</text>
  <text start="1355.8" dur="10.11">wrote it best health care is about</text>
  <text start="1357.809" dur="10.861">healing not killing so this industry</text>
  <text start="1365.91" dur="8.91">needs to be shut down and we need to be</text>
  <text start="1368.67" dur="12.21">as organized as they are because as much</text>
  <text start="1374.82" dur="9.93">as we like to rag on leftists and how</text>
  <text start="1380.88" dur="6.81">insane they are sometimes they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1384.75" dur="6.36">organized in their efforts why else do</text>
  <text start="1387.69" dur="11.1">you think these policies are getting</text>
  <text start="1391.11" dur="12.26">passed Roe vs. Wade for example means to</text>
  <text start="1398.79" dur="4.58">be overturned right now</text>
  <text start="1404.33" dur="8.59">abortion should be banned everywhere</text>
  <text start="1408.059" dur="9.301">right now why because it&amp;#39;s not about</text>
  <text start="1412.92" dur="7.74">women&amp;#39;s rights it&amp;#39;s about them making a</text>
  <text start="1417.36" dur="14.46">profit off of selling babies who aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1420.66" dur="13.08">born crime against humanity and of</text>
  <text start="1431.82" dur="3.66">course as always I will continue to</text>
  <text start="1433.74" dur="3.93">update you guys on this case I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1440.58" dur="3.9">much information as I possibly can</text>
  <text start="1442.17" dur="4.88">because I know the media is not talking</text>
  <text start="1444.48" dur="6.51">about this not even alternative media</text>
  <text start="1447.05" dur="7.21">largely silent LifeSite news is one of</text>
  <text start="1450.99" dur="7.83">the only ones so LifeSite news and then</text>
  <text start="1454.26" dur="6.78">the actual website for the defense force</text>
  <text start="1458.82" dur="5.85">and your merits Liberty Council so</text>
  <text start="1461.04" dur="8.43">that&amp;#39;s LC org they also give updates on</text>
  <text start="1464.67" dur="8.46">this case other than that the media is</text>
  <text start="1469.47" dur="10.1">dark so I will continue to give you guys</text>
  <text start="1473.13" dur="10.38">updates as it comes up all right so also</text>
  <text start="1479.57" dur="4.66">we have a representative in Florida here</text>
  <text start="1483.51" dur="3.72">in Florida</text>
  <text start="1484.23" dur="5.03">who is now presented a very bold bill</text>
  <text start="1487.23" dur="4.409">and this is actually the second</text>
  <text start="1489.26" dur="4.149">representative here in Florida that has</text>
  <text start="1491.639" dur="4.02">made some pretty bold moves yesterday I</text>
  <text start="1493.409" dur="7.171">reported on a Florida representative who</text>
  <text start="1495.659" dur="8.73">actually has put forth a bill that wants</text>
  <text start="1500.58" dur="6.63">to eliminate the requirements for a</text>
  <text start="1504.389" dur="5.25">permit for concealed carry and calling</text>
  <text start="1507.21" dur="2.79">it constitutional carry that is a good</text>
  <text start="1509.639" dur="2.941">thing</text>
  <text start="1510" dur="4.47">bold move certainly now we have</text>
  <text start="1512.58" dur="3.99">representative Mike Hill who files</text>
  <text start="1514.47" dur="4.439">fetal heartbeat abortion ban bill that</text>
  <text start="1516.57" dur="6.41">removes all medical exceptions so</text>
  <text start="1518.909" dur="7.5">initially he had submitted a bill that</text>
  <text start="1522.98" dur="5.02">would ban abortions once a heartbeat</text>
  <text start="1526.409" dur="4.831">could be detected which is about six</text>
  <text start="1528" dur="5.34">weeks however it did have exceptions so</text>
  <text start="1531.24" dur="4.83">exceptions in the cases of rape in the</text>
  <text start="1533.34" dur="5.25">case of incest in the case of human</text>
  <text start="1536.07" dur="5.839">trafficking in the case of the mother&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1538.59" dur="6.209">life being in danger that didn&amp;#39;t pass</text>
  <text start="1541.909" dur="6.461">now he&amp;#39;s coming forward with a bill</text>
  <text start="1544.799" dur="9.181">that&amp;#39;s even more bold no medical</text>
  <text start="1548.37" dur="7.71">exceptions whatsoever including the</text>
  <text start="1553.98" dur="4.319">mother&amp;#39;s life being endangered now this</text>
  <text start="1556.08" dur="8.03">is probably going to get a lot of</text>
  <text start="1558.299" dur="11.191">criticism even from pro-life individuals</text>
  <text start="1564.11" dur="8.679">and of course that&amp;#39;s because we want to</text>
  <text start="1569.49" dur="5.13">preserve life so anytime I say the</text>
  <text start="1572.789" dur="5.221">woman&amp;#39;s life is in danger the mother&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1574.62" dur="5.76">life is in danger then we automatically</text>
  <text start="1578.01" dur="4.379">think that it has to be a choice between</text>
  <text start="1580.38" dur="5.429">you either have to kill the baby or you</text>
  <text start="1582.389" dur="6.571">have to kill the mother but let me just</text>
  <text start="1585.809" dur="4.86">say this let me just explain this now</text>
  <text start="1588.96" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;ve seen this too so I&amp;#39;m just going to</text>
  <text start="1590.669" dur="3.661">give a little bit of a background story</text>
  <text start="1592.23" dur="4.98">so before I decided to get into</text>

  <text start="1708.9" dur="6.45">saying before where we cannot play God</text>
  <text start="1711.63" dur="8.4">and decide whether or not a baby is</text>

  <text start="1751.23" dur="6.779">they would so really when they talk</text>
  <text start="1755.879" dur="4.591">about the mothers like being in danger</text>
  <text start="1758.009" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re trying to fear monger they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1760.47" dur="3.779">trying to get an emotional response out</text>
  <text start="1762.659" dur="5.551">of people they&amp;#39;re trying to sway public</text>
  <text start="1764.249" dur="9.331">opinion by getting an emotional response</text>
  <text start="1768.21" dur="11.449">out of that statement so I actually</text>
  <text start="1773.58" dur="6.079">support his no exceptions on this bill</text>
  <text start="1780.379" dur="7.78">no exceptions do I think it&amp;#39;s gonna pass</text>
  <text start="1784.47" dur="7.02">no I don&amp;#39;t it probably won&amp;#39;t even get to</text>
  <text start="1788.159" dur="6.36">a vote because the Democrats control the</text>
  <text start="1791.49" dur="5.97">house what needs to happen is we have to</text>
  <text start="1794.519" dur="4.441">take back the house so when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1797.46" dur="4.439">2020 we have to make sure that we</text>
  <text start="1798.96" dur="4.74">understand not only is the presidential</text>
  <text start="1801.899" dur="4.37">election important we have to reelect</text>
  <text start="1803.7" dur="5.49">President Trump or we will be seeing</text>
  <text start="1806.269" dur="4.87">socialism on the horizon very soon after</text>
  <text start="1809.19" dur="3.479">that if he&amp;#39;s not elected so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1811.139" dur="3.39">important to real echt him and also at</text>
  <text start="1812.669" dur="5.181">the same time we have to retake the</text>
  <text start="1814.529" dur="8.76">house and we have to keep the Senate</text>
  <text start="1817.85" dur="6.699">very important otherwise then things</text>
  <text start="1823.289" dur="4.681">like this happen where we have bills</text>
  <text start="1824.549" dur="5.901">that don&amp;#39;t even get to a vote okay</text>
  <text start="1827.97" dur="4.77">related to that so Planned Parenthood I</text>
  <text start="1830.45" dur="5.02">reported yesterday that they have</text>
  <text start="1832.74" dur="4.98">announced they are going to throw forty</text>
  <text start="1835.47" dur="5.309">five million dollars at the 2020</text>
  <text start="1837.72" dur="7.289">campaign they&amp;#39;re targeting different</text>
  <text start="1840.779" dur="6.421">states they want to flip those states</text>
  <text start="1845.009" dur="5.37">and of course now they&amp;#39;re calling it red</text>
  <text start="1847.2" dur="5.16">to pink so of course not just red to</text>
  <text start="1850.379" dur="5.16">blue they want it red to pink meaning</text>
  <text start="1852.36" dur="5.88">those districts that will support their</text>
  <text start="1855.539" dur="4.201">agenda that&amp;#39;s what they want so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1858.24" dur="3.12">throwing forty five million dollars of</text>
  <text start="1859.74" dur="3.059">this Oh even though at the same time</text>
  <text start="1861.36" dur="2.699">they&amp;#39;re crying about how much they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1862.799" dur="3.171">have money and how they have to shut</text>
  <text start="1864.059" dur="3.71">down clinics that don&amp;#39;t house abortions</text>
  <text start="1865.97" dur="6.579">give me a break</text>
  <text start="1867.769" dur="6.76">so now they have issued their first wave</text>
  <text start="1872.549" dur="4.951">of twenty twenty House and Senate</text>
  <text start="1874.529" dur="6.931">endorsements includes ninety individuals</text>
  <text start="1877.5" dur="4.909">or eighty nine to be exact actually so</text>
  <text start="1881.46" dur="3.269">they&amp;#39;re endorsing</text>
  <text start="1882.409" dur="4.39">Senate hopeful Mark Kelly who is a</text>
  <text start="1884.729" dur="4.89">Democrat running to unseat senator</text>
  <text start="1886.799" dur="5.22">Martha McSally in Arizona incumbent</text>
  <text start="1889.619" dur="5.43">senators Gary Peters Tina Smith and</text>
  <text start="1892.019" dur="5.78">jeanne Shaheen all Democrats from</text>
  <text start="1895.049" dur="6.63">Minnesota Michigan and New Hampshire and</text>
  <text start="1897.799" dur="6.82">there are a slew of others who they are</text>
  <text start="1901.679" dur="6.84">endorsing both newcomers and also</text>
  <text start="1904.619" dur="6.27">incumbents so we have to be very aware</text>
  <text start="1908.519" dur="4.71">of this and know that they are coming</text>
  <text start="1910.889" dur="4.38">out to fight they&amp;#39;re organizing and they</text>
  <text start="1913.229" dur="6">want to make sure that their agenda is</text>
  <text start="1915.269" dur="10.47">preserved we have to work just as hard</text>
  <text start="1919.229" dur="8.67">against them now also speaking of</text>
  <text start="1925.739" dur="3">organized we have this extinction</text>
  <text start="1927.899" dur="3.33">rebellion</text>
  <text start="1928.739" dur="4.44">so I mentioned when I had first reported</text>
  <text start="1931.229" dur="3.961">on this yesterday I just learned about</text>
  <text start="1933.179" dur="4.56">this actually I didn&amp;#39;t even know that</text>
  <text start="1935.19" dur="5.309">this was occurring it just sort of</text>
  <text start="1937.739" dur="5.16">sprung up but when I originally report</text>
  <text start="1940.499" dur="7.321">started reporting on it yesterday they</text>
  <text start="1942.899" dur="7.53">were limited to cities in Europe but I</text>
  <text start="1947.82" dur="4.439">said that it would come here to the</text>
  <text start="1950.429" dur="4.98">United States and I knew that it would</text>
  <text start="1952.259" dur="5.97">why because we already had greta</text>
  <text start="1955.409" dur="9.21">Thornburg all the way over here from</text>
  <text start="1958.229" dur="7.471">Sweden talking to Iowa you think this</text>
  <text start="1964.619" dur="5.24">isn&amp;#39;t part of an agenda</text>
  <text start="1965.7" dur="4.159">she&amp;#39;s definitely part of an agenda</text>
  <text start="1970.249" dur="10.03">definitely she was at the UN making an</text>
  <text start="1976.32" dur="11.459">argument there with their own paper</text>
  <text start="1980.279" dur="10.1">as if we wouldn&amp;#39;t know so now the</text>
  <text start="1987.779" dur="5.041">extinction rebellion has sprung up</text>
  <text start="1990.379" dur="5.321">worldwide major cities across the globe</text>
  <text start="1992.82" dur="5.699">and they even were in New York City they</text>
  <text start="1995.7" dur="5.429">shut down Times Square they superglued</text>
  <text start="1998.519" dur="7.29">themselves to have to a vote now they</text>
  <text start="2001.129" dur="6.99">haven&amp;#39;t gotten violent they are really</text>
  <text start="2005.809" dur="6.45">about non-violence which is good we</text>
  <text start="2008.119" dur="5.85">don&amp;#39;t need another antiva however we</text>
  <text start="2012.259" dur="3.48">should not overlook this just because</text>
  <text start="2013.969" dur="2.54">they&amp;#39;re not violent because they are</text>
  <text start="2015.739" dur="5.36">disrupt</text>
  <text start="2016.509" dur="7.98">ding city&amp;#39;s major cities and that is</text>
  <text start="2021.099" dur="6.99">their goal to disrupt until their goals</text>
  <text start="2024.489" dur="7.951">are accomplished and their goal is to</text>
  <text start="2028.089" dur="8.31">have their goals written into law they</text>
  <text start="2032.44" dur="5.669">want it made into legislation so here</text>
  <text start="2036.399" dur="4.86">they had superglued themselves to the</text>
  <text start="2038.109" dur="5.19">boat and superglued themselves to the</text>
  <text start="2041.259" dur="3.39">ground this is very similar to what was</text>
  <text start="2043.299" dur="2.58">happening over in Europe they did the</text>
  <text start="2044.649" dur="4.17">same thing over there where they would</text>
  <text start="2045.879" dur="4.44">glue themselves to buildings and of</text>
  <text start="2048.819" dur="4.02">course they used superglue because then</text>
  <text start="2050.319" dur="4.32">they would it would be hard to remove</text>
  <text start="2052.839" dur="3.18">them and of course police officers</text>
  <text start="2054.639" dur="4.051">probably don&amp;#39;t want to hurt them so you</text>
  <text start="2056.019" dur="5.181">can&amp;#39;t exactly rip them off of walls and</text>
  <text start="2058.69" dur="6.479">objects it&amp;#39;s not going to work so</text>
  <text start="2061.2" dur="6.809">they&amp;#39;re being very effective and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2065.169" dur="5.16">setting up in very strategic locations</text>
  <text start="2068.009" dur="6.9">now the other thing I want to say about</text>
  <text start="2070.329" dur="7.68">this is they&amp;#39;re being backed up by</text>
  <text start="2074.909" dur="6.43">funders now in this article when they</text>
  <text start="2078.009" dur="5.67">talk about who funds the group they give</text>
  <text start="2081.339" dur="5.131">you this link that takes you to some</text>
  <text start="2083.679" dur="5.16">donation site and it says that it lists</text>
  <text start="2086.47" dur="5.76">all the donors but it doesn&amp;#39;t it only</text>
  <text start="2088.839" dur="7.861">lists the very small donations $500 and</text>
  <text start="2092.23" dur="8.639">less right however among their biggest</text>
  <text start="2096.7" dur="6.809">supporters is this guy who is one of</text>
  <text start="2100.869" dur="5.43">Britain&amp;#39;s richest men this is Sir</text>
  <text start="2103.509" dur="6.06">Christopher home who is worth 1.2</text>
  <text start="2106.299" dur="5.851">billion he gave $50,000 personally and</text>
  <text start="2109.569" dur="4.77">then his organization the children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2112.15" dur="4.169">investment fund Foundation also donated</text>
  <text start="2114.339" dur="4.17">more than one hundred and fifty thousand</text>
  <text start="2116.319" dur="6.891">so that&amp;#39;s more than 200 grand that he</text>
  <text start="2118.509" dur="11.79">gave to this group to this cause now</text>
  <text start="2123.21" dur="10.149">with this guy he belongs to or at one</text>
  <text start="2130.299" dur="5.46">point belong to a company called Perry</text>
  <text start="2133.359" dur="5.96">capital LLC and that has actually hedge</text>
  <text start="2135.759" dur="5.36">fund in wall street where they give a</text>
  <text start="2139.319" dur="4.03">significant amount of money to</text>
  <text start="2141.119" dur="4.631">democratic causes and individuals</text>
  <text start="2143.349" dur="3.75">including President Obama so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2145.75" dur="4.109">really surprised that he would be</text>
  <text start="2147.099" dur="3.241">backing this cause now I really wanted</text>
  <text start="2149.859" dur="3.421">to check</text>
  <text start="2150.34" dur="5.76">his organization the children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2153.28" dur="4.17">investment fund foundation and so if you</text>
  <text start="2156.1" dur="3.09">go to the home page you can see they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2157.45" dur="3.84">highlighting some of their main focuses</text>
  <text start="2159.19" dur="4.59">and the first one here is childhood in a</text>
  <text start="2161.29" dur="6.98">lesson so I checked that one out and of</text>
  <text start="2163.78" dur="7.64">course when you scroll down one of their</text>
  <text start="2168.27" dur="8.08">main agendas is adolescent sexual health</text>
  <text start="2171.42" dur="8.92">so they want to intervene on the sexual</text>
  <text start="2176.35" dur="7.29">health of adolescents and of course they</text>
  <text start="2180.34" dur="5.7">want to prevent unwanted pregnancies and</text>
  <text start="2183.64" dur="6.9">HIV wow this really sounds familiar</text>
  <text start="2186.04" dur="9.3">like the Clinton Global Initiative not</text>
  <text start="2190.54" dur="6.72">surprising now when we return and go</text>
  <text start="2195.34" dur="4.74">back to the homepage and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="2197.26" dur="5.25">about strategic headlines so this is</text>
  <text start="2200.08" dur="6.81">what they want to focus on between the</text>
  <text start="2202.51" dur="5.82">time period of 2017 to 2021 now one of</text>
  <text start="2206.89" dur="4.59">the things that really popped out at me</text>
  <text start="2208.33" dur="6.27">here was this line right here let me see</text>
  <text start="2211.48" dur="5.64">if I can highlight it sustainable</text>
  <text start="2214.6" dur="5.25">development goals this right here</text>
  <text start="2217.12" dur="5.12">sustainable development goals now any of</text>
  <text start="2219.85" dur="5.1">you if you&amp;#39;re familiar with agenda 2030</text>
  <text start="2222.24" dur="4.51">you&amp;#39;d be familiar with sustainable</text>
  <text start="2224.95" dur="9.75">development goals because that is</text>
  <text start="2226.75" dur="11.79">exactly what agenda 2030 is so now is</text>
  <text start="2234.7" dur="8.43">this organization linked up with the</text>
  <text start="2238.54" dur="6.69">United Nations it&amp;#39;s likely especially</text>
  <text start="2243.13" dur="7.56">since they&amp;#39;re behind this extinction</text>
  <text start="2245.23" dur="8.52">rebellion and also of course Greta</text>
  <text start="2250.69" dur="7.26">Thornburg who is the face of climate</text>
  <text start="2253.75" dur="6.93">change right now she is also affiliated</text>
  <text start="2257.95" dur="3.21">with the extinction rebellion at this</text>
  <text start="2260.68" dur="3.39">point</text>
  <text start="2261.16" dur="9.15">and she&amp;#39;s also affiliated with the</text>
  <text start="2264.07" dur="9.3">United Nations so all of this is saying</text>
  <text start="2270.31" dur="5.22">that this is a United Nations effort</text>
  <text start="2273.37" dur="8.18">which is not surprising because of</text>
  <text start="2275.53" dur="6.02">course here we are 2020 almost</text>
  <text start="2281.71" dur="7.05">they have this agenda 2030 so ten in ten</text>
  <text start="2286.809" dur="4.02">years in ten years time they need to</text>
  <text start="2288.76" dur="4.98">accomplish those goals that are in</text>
  <text start="2290.829" dur="8.311">agenda 2030 and they call it sustainable</text>
  <text start="2293.74" dur="9.75">development now back to extinction</text>
  <text start="2299.14" dur="6.24">rebellions so they are a very organized</text>
  <text start="2303.49" dur="4.56">movement and of course this could be</text>
  <text start="2305.38" dur="4.92">because of course they have this backing</text>
  <text start="2308.05" dur="5.4">of these very powerful individuals and</text>
  <text start="2310.3" dur="5.19">groups but this is not something that we</text>
  <text start="2313.45" dur="6.149">couldn&amp;#39;t do if we organize ourselves</text>
  <text start="2315.49" dur="8.45">enough so they actually have training so</text>
  <text start="2319.599" dur="7.611">they&amp;#39;re training their people how to</text>
  <text start="2323.94" dur="5.77">protest what they should be doing and</text>
  <text start="2327.21" dur="5.67">they even give suggestions and then of</text>
  <text start="2329.71" dur="6.06">course they have little webinars on</text>
  <text start="2332.88" dur="5.62">different things that they can use to</text>
  <text start="2335.77" dur="8.9">indoctrinate people with so for example</text>
  <text start="2338.5" dur="8.48">this one utopia this is a webinar for</text>
  <text start="2344.67" dur="6.25">indoctrination purposes</text>
  <text start="2346.98" dur="5.65">welcome sessions sacrificial art all</text>
  <text start="2350.92" dur="5.37">these are webinars and then they have</text>
  <text start="2352.63" dur="5.28">trainings on how to protest and then of</text>
  <text start="2356.29" dur="4.4">course they give suggestions on what you</text>
  <text start="2357.91" dur="6.05">should do you should glue yourself to</text>
  <text start="2360.69" dur="6.94">buildings to roads you should</text>
  <text start="2363.96" dur="7.03">participate in naked protests this is</text>
  <text start="2367.63" dur="6.06">real this is what they&amp;#39;re suggesting to</text>
  <text start="2370.99" dur="10.74">disrupt society so that they can move</text>
  <text start="2373.69" dur="12.23">forward their agenda now when I look at</text>
  <text start="2381.73" dur="8.97">the origins of the extinction rebellion</text>
  <text start="2385.92" dur="8.08">they&amp;#39;re saying that it spawned from the</text>
  <text start="2390.7" dur="5.669">green New Deal group now we here in the</text>
  <text start="2394" dur="4.92">United States or at least some of us</text>
  <text start="2396.369" dur="6.361">definitely me I had never heard of the</text>
  <text start="2398.92" dur="8.31">green new deal until it was really</text>
  <text start="2402.73" dur="7.079">pushed forward by some of the House</text>
  <text start="2407.23" dur="4.079">Democrats and this became their deal</text>
  <text start="2409.809" dur="3.22">their green new deal</text>
  <text start="2411.309" dur="5.2">no it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2413.029" dur="5.371">this was not their idea so in fact the</text>
  <text start="2416.509" dur="7.22">green New Deal group was something that</text>
  <text start="2418.4" dur="5.329">had started in the UK back in 2007 and</text>
  <text start="2424.839" dur="7.5">that was founded by hope I get his name</text>
  <text start="2430.219" dur="5.84">I think it was Thomas Friedman and</text>
  <text start="2432.339" dur="5.98">Thomas Friedman was a journalist who</text>
  <text start="2436.059" dur="3.88">worked for the New York Times and he</text>
  <text start="2438.319" dur="2.85">would at one point during the Bill</text>
  <text start="2439.939" dur="3.78">Clinton administration he was a</text>
  <text start="2441.169" dur="7.08">correspondent for the White House well</text>
  <text start="2443.719" dur="8.49">in 2006 or 2007 he had written an op-ed</text>
  <text start="2448.249" dur="6.27">where he talked about this ideology this</text>
  <text start="2452.209" dur="10.38">what eventually would become the green</text>
  <text start="2454.519" dur="12.75">New Deal is this a surprise no all of</text>
  <text start="2462.589" dur="6.09">this is an agenda just like I have been</text>
  <text start="2467.269" dur="7.4">saying for a while</text>
  <text start="2468.679" dur="11.451">this green New Deal is a soft rollout of</text>
  <text start="2474.669" dur="10.69">agenda 2030 it&amp;#39;s exactly what it is</text>
  <text start="2480.13" dur="8.889">Genda 2030 is a product of the United</text>
  <text start="2485.359" dur="9.06">Nations it&amp;#39;s an agenda of the United</text>
  <text start="2489.019" dur="9.78">Nations and it&amp;#39;s all being presented as</text>
  <text start="2494.419" dur="6.84">a movement towards quote sustainable</text>
  <text start="2498.799" dur="4.29">development but it&amp;#39;s also really about</text>
  <text start="2501.259" dur="5.25">control it&amp;#39;s about control</text>
  <text start="2503.089" dur="5.91">redistribution of wealth about the</text>
  <text start="2506.509" dur="5.131">breakdown of borders the breakdown of</text>
  <text start="2508.999" dur="5.16">sovereign nations the creation of a</text>
  <text start="2511.64" dur="8.119">homogeneous or largely homogeneous human</text>
  <text start="2514.159" dur="5.6">race or the new humanity so to speak</text>
  <text start="2519.819" dur="5.95">this is the New World Order and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2523.939" dur="4.23">mentioned this before I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="2525.769" dur="7.44">this before but when it comes to the New</text>
  <text start="2528.169" dur="9">World Order really the public largely</text>
  <text start="2533.209" dur="7.53">doesn&amp;#39;t believe in it it&amp;#39;s a conspiracy</text>
  <text start="2537.169" dur="5.85">theory right even though Papy Bush had</text>
  <text start="2540.739" dur="4.92">stated that that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going for</text>
  <text start="2543.019" dur="3.091">we&amp;#39;re moving into a new world order he</text>
  <text start="2545.659" dur="4.351">said</text>
  <text start="2546.11" dur="5.64">but the media and others have played it</text>
  <text start="2550.01" dur="3.45">down so much they diluted it to</text>
  <text start="2551.75" dur="6.75">illegitimate II but here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="2553.46" dur="7.65">it&amp;#39;s a real agenda but it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="2558.5" dur="10.11">disguised as an agenda for sustainable</text>
  <text start="2561.11" dur="10.5">development a utopia so to speak but</text>
  <text start="2568.61" dur="7.08">it&amp;#39;s not really a utopia but this is</text>
  <text start="2571.61" dur="8.04">agenda 2030 the green New Deal is not</text>
  <text start="2575.69" dur="6.33">new it is not the brainchild of AOC it</text>
  <text start="2579.65" dur="4.2">is not something that was created by the</text>
  <text start="2582.02" dur="4.74">House Democrats the green New Deal is</text>
  <text start="2583.85" dur="9.03">something that has really been in the</text>
  <text start="2586.76" dur="8.28">works for quite a while now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2592.88" dur="6.93">largely all of this is largely being</text>
  <text start="2595.04" dur="7.56">pushed by the United Nations and think</text>
  <text start="2599.81" dur="6.15">about where we are right now of how</text>
  <text start="2602.6" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re moving through this phase but</text>
  <text start="2605.96" dur="4.56">people don&amp;#39;t even notice so we have this</text>
  <text start="2607.94" dur="4.32">immigration crisis and in the middle of</text>
  <text start="2610.52" dur="3.33">this immigration crisis we also have</text>
  <text start="2612.26" dur="5.79">refugee crisis where people are just</text>
  <text start="2613.85" dur="8.19">moving about they&amp;#39;re being displaced and</text>
  <text start="2618.05" dur="10.32">moved to other places breakdown of</text>
  <text start="2622.04" dur="9.54">cultures breakdown of borders and also</text>
  <text start="2628.37" dur="4.92">at the same time as this crisis we have</text>
  <text start="2631.58" dur="4.83">the signing of the global pact for</text>
  <text start="2633.29" dur="5.28">migration put forth by the United</text>
  <text start="2636.41" dur="4.08">Nations the global pact for migration</text>
  <text start="2638.57" dur="4.14">states that migration is a human right</text>
  <text start="2640.49" dur="5.1">and should not be regulated was signed</text>
  <text start="2642.71" dur="7.02">by nearly every country thank God our</text>
  <text start="2645.59" dur="8.85">president did not sign that but nearly</text>
  <text start="2649.73" dur="7.89">every other country did now we have the</text>
  <text start="2654.44" dur="10.32">Pope promoting the global pact for</text>
  <text start="2657.62" dur="7.8">education for a new humanity this is</text>
  <text start="2664.76" dur="3.03">serious</text>
  <text start="2665.42" dur="4.56">now we also have these climate</text>
  <text start="2667.79" dur="4.98">extremists coming up seemingly out of</text>
  <text start="2669.98" dur="4.23">nowhere to be honest I have never even</text>
  <text start="2672.77" dur="4.02">heard of the extinction rebellion a</text>
  <text start="2674.21" dur="5.37">couple days ago now all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="2676.79" dur="5.26">they&amp;#39;re a worldwide movement</text>
  <text start="2679.58" dur="4.93">shutting down major cities across the</text>
  <text start="2682.05" dur="4.44">globe shutting down airports shutting</text>
  <text start="2684.51" dur="6.27">down Times Square shutting down</text>
  <text start="2686.49" dur="11.64">businesses they have a bill written up</text>
  <text start="2690.78" dur="11.13">that they want to put into law this is</text>
  <text start="2698.13" dur="6.57">happening they are organized we have to</text>
  <text start="2701.91" dur="4.17">counter this because if we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="2704.7" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t want to be those people who aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2706.08" dur="3.87">paying attention to it and then five</text>
  <text start="2708.21" dur="3.93">years from now we wake up well I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2709.95" dur="5.46">know how this happened why is the world</text>
  <text start="2712.14" dur="7.41">this way how did we get here we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2715.41" dur="6.03">paying attention yeah they have the</text>
  <text start="2719.55" dur="4.08">backing of very powerful individuals and</text>
  <text start="2721.44" dur="6.679">organizations but that should not deter</text>
  <text start="2723.63" dur="4.489">us to become organized to become United</text>
  <text start="2728.18" dur="9.13">we have to think of a concrete way to</text>
  <text start="2731.04" dur="11.52">counter all of this and as an example</text>
  <text start="2737.31" dur="6.93">our founding fathers the first Americans</text>
  <text start="2742.56" dur="3.63">who were here well aside from Native</text>
  <text start="2744.24" dur="4.41">Americans of course but our founding</text>
  <text start="2746.19" dur="9.12">fathers who fought for our independence</text>
  <text start="2748.65" dur="10.59">from Britain they were not even a real</text>
  <text start="2755.31" dur="7.47">army they were not and yet they were</text>
  <text start="2759.24" dur="11.16">able to defeat one of the most powerful</text>
  <text start="2762.78" dur="9.809">armies in the entire world so let that</text>
  <text start="2770.4" dur="4.58">be an example that we should not be</text>
  <text start="2772.589" dur="5.461">deterred by the fact that this movement</text>
  <text start="2774.98" dur="4.45">whatever&amp;#39;s happening right now it is</text>
  <text start="2778.05" dur="4.11">backed by these large powerful</text>
  <text start="2779.43" dur="7.02">organizations because our founding</text>
  <text start="2782.16" dur="7.73">fathers were not deterred by that so we</text>
  <text start="2786.45" dur="7.53">have to keep the spirit of America alive</text>
  <text start="2789.89" dur="8.26">keep the spirit of Independence alive we</text>
  <text start="2793.98" dur="6.24">have to counter this I love to hear your</text>
