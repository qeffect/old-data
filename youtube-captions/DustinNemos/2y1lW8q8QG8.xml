  <text start="48.94" dur="4.289">them as well the way that they support</text>
  <text start="50.62" dur="4.56">independent media like this show and I</text>
  <text start="53.229" dur="3.781">will dive right into what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="55.18" dur="3.75">with Giuliani and the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="57.01" dur="4.41">back-and-forth attack and how he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.93" dur="4.71">exposing Biden and possibly even the</text>
  <text start="61.42" dur="4.559">Obama White House administration and</text>
  <text start="63.64" dur="4.08">this is really starting to heat up and</text>
  <text start="65.979" dur="4.14">of course that&amp;#39;s a sideshow to the</text>
  <text start="67.72" dur="4.2">impeachment itself which isn&amp;#39;t heating</text>
  <text start="70.119" dur="3.871">up at all not even a little bit it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="71.92" dur="3.99">going anywhere and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="73.99" dur="4.08">gonna still try to take it somewhere but</text>
  <text start="75.91" dur="4.56">it seems that even the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="78.07" dur="3.839">having a mutiny now they&amp;#39;re abandoning</text>
  <text start="80.47" dur="3.66">ship the third of them don&amp;#39;t even want</text>
  <text start="81.909" dur="4.411">to see impeachment and some of them the</text>
  <text start="84.13" dur="3.96">leaders the politicians that don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="86.32" dur="4.89">to go back and lose their new job or</text>
  <text start="88.09" dur="4.589">their cushy job they&amp;#39;re facing a really</text>
  <text start="91.21" dur="4.14">hard time to sell this to their</text>
  <text start="92.679" dur="4.291">constituents so many of them are even</text>
  <text start="95.35" dur="4.409">starting to jump off the impeachment</text>
  <text start="96.97" dur="4.11">bandwagon I mean they hate Trump just</text>
  <text start="99.759" dur="3.84">like everyone else but they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="101.08" dur="4.349">pragmatic right because they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="103.599" dur="4.77">to lose their seat and they understand</text>
  <text start="105.429" dur="4.47">that look the the halls of Congress are</text>
  <text start="108.369" dur="3.78">a little bit more anti-trump than</text>
  <text start="109.899" dur="5.28">America and if they want to keep their</text>
  <text start="112.149" dur="5.22">job they have to play along so if these</text>
  <text start="115.179" dur="3.991">folks vote impeachment or if they</text>
  <text start="117.369" dur="4.2">continue to be seen as going along with</text>
  <text start="119.17" dur="4.35">it they are losing voters every day</text>
  <text start="121.569" dur="3.901">hemorrhaging voters every day and they</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t want to so you&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="125.47" dur="4.44">seeing Democrats jump off of impeachment</text>
  <text start="127.69" dur="5.76">or try to segue into something like</text>
  <text start="129.91" dur="4.98">censure or or just you know anything</text>
  <text start="133.45" dur="2.94">else but impeachment because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="134.89" dur="4.26">hurting them it steams them to keep</text>
  <text start="136.39" dur="5.25">hanging on to this red hot coal that</text>
  <text start="139.15" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re trying to use to hurt us and it</text>
  <text start="141.64" dur="4.08">just burns them right but no one else is</text>
  <text start="144.16" dur="3.75">gonna play with them so they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="4.29">stuck holding the hot potato in this</text>
  <text start="147.91" dur="3.54">metaphor anyway let&amp;#39;s dive in and see</text>
  <text start="150.01" dur="2.91">what I&amp;#39;m talking about and I&amp;#39;ll catch</text>

  <text start="152.92" dur="5.19">from our Patriot sponsors there was a</text>
  <text start="155.59" dur="4.59">time when I had my head in the sand then</text>
  <text start="158.11" dur="4.76">I found out that powered platers past</text>
  <text start="160.18" dur="5.49">lies for truth and truth for lies</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="6.34">especially in areas of life and hell I</text>
  <text start="165.67" dur="6.12">used to stay quiet and now I speak up</text>

  <text start="184.93" dur="6.35">living calm wake up stand up speak up</text>
  <text start="194.88" dur="6.31">so let&amp;#39;s go right into the big stuff you</text>
  <text start="199.48" dur="3.12">Rudy Guiliani who is now helping</text>
  <text start="201.19" dur="3.57">president Trump in his battle against</text>
  <text start="202.6" dur="3.72">the deep state who by the way has a</text>
  <text start="204.76" dur="3.15">little bit of a fighter spirit to him</text>
  <text start="206.32" dur="3.57">and has helped go after the mob family</text>
  <text start="207.91" dur="4.56">before as well in New York and he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="209.89" dur="4.83">experience right at not only dealing</text>
  <text start="212.47" dur="4.5">with dangerous opponents in the in the</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="3.99">optics as well as in the courts and as</text>
  <text start="216.97" dur="3.21">well as kind of behind the scene and the</text>
  <text start="218.71" dur="3.63">shady stuff that goes on I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.18" dur="5.31">got guards and people are watching his</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="5.61">back it&amp;#39;s very interesting to see that</text>
  <text start="225.49" dur="5.1">he&amp;#39;s now going after Biden and even the</text>
  <text start="227.95" dur="6.63">Obama administration about billions of</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="5.91">dollars of missing US cash so Rudy</text>
  <text start="234.58" dur="3.81">Giuliani just dropped a bank safe on the</text>
  <text start="236.5" dur="3.96">heads of Joe Biden and Barack Obama a</text>
  <text start="238.39" dur="4.32">bank safe that might be missing billions</text>
  <text start="240.46" dur="4.17">in US funds this is getting interesting</text>
  <text start="242.71" dur="4.44">and ugly fast</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="4.53">what a surprise more missing money</text>
  <text start="247.15" dur="4.86">linked to Biden and his former boss and</text>
  <text start="249.16" dur="4.65">talk of another Obama cover-up so this</text>
  <text start="252.01" dur="4.71">is from the article troop on true pundit</text>
  <text start="253.81" dur="4.35">and Julie Ani here on Twitter which is</text>
  <text start="256.72" dur="3.87">said the accounts chamber in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="258.16" dur="4.05">found an alleged misuse of 5.3 billion</text>
  <text start="260.59" dur="4.19">in US funds during the Obama</text>
  <text start="262.21" dur="5.79">administration while Obama was point man</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="5.89">Obama embassy urged Ukrainian police not</text>
  <text start="268" dur="5.13">to investigate stay tuned and find out</text>
  <text start="270.67" dur="4.62">why so basically the answer is very</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="3.66">simple we&amp;#39;ve already seen the pattern</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="4.14">right we&amp;#39;ve seen the pattern with China</text>
  <text start="276.79" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;ve seen the pattern with Ukraine now</text>
  <text start="279.43" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;ve seen the pattern with the Biden&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.9" dur="5.49">and and also with Pelosi zone son Paul</text>
  <text start="283.6" dur="5.67">jr. and we&amp;#39;ve seen the pattern with</text>
  <text start="286.39" dur="4.77">Kerry&amp;#39;s son so there&amp;#39;s all of these kids</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="4.89">wives family members of these</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="5.25">politicians being enriched at the public</text>
  <text start="294.16" dur="3.54">expense like who&amp;#39;d have thought it right</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="3.09">the government doesn&amp;#39;t spend all that</text>
  <text start="297.7" dur="4.41">money on us who&amp;#39;d have thought it uh</text>
  <text start="299.5" dur="4.02">being a little sarcastic here the</text>
  <text start="302.11" dur="3.45">government of course takes in billions</text>
  <text start="303.52" dur="3.93">of dollars they give us pennies to tell</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="3.45">us that we&amp;#39;re lucky that they broke our</text>
  <text start="307.45" dur="2.67">leg and then they sold us a wheelchair</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="3.11">and that we should be happy with it</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="4.44">while they fly around the world and big</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="4.6">billion-dollar jets living lifestyles</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="4.11">that not only could we only dream of but</text>
  <text start="316.72" dur="3.78">probably wouldn&amp;#39;t even want to be part</text>
  <text start="318.67" dur="3.93">of because of the immorality involved</text>
  <text start="320.5" dur="4.23">yeah sure wealth and power and prestige</text>
  <text start="322.6" dur="3.99">and such but you know those things have</text>
  <text start="324.73" dur="3.51">a price on the soul as well when you</text>
  <text start="326.59" dur="4.5">become too greedy into folk</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;m materialistic and that I think many</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="3.78">of them have possibly paid that price</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="2.94">you know they the corruption it gets</text>
  <text start="334.87" dur="2.549">worse</text>
  <text start="335.44" dur="4.68">the taboo it gets it gets a little bit</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="5.641">harder to reach the the new high gets a</text>
  <text start="340.12" dur="4.41">little harder to sustain that what your</text>
  <text start="343.06" dur="2.91">thought was fun before you know</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="3.21">threesomes with supermodels as a</text>
  <text start="345.97" dur="3.33">billionaire it&amp;#39;s not as exciting anymore</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="2.79">maybe and now you want to try to mess</text>
  <text start="349.3" dur="2.97">with something a little younger if you</text>
  <text start="350.53" dur="5.66">know what I mean so this is the kind of</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="6.84">corruption that too much power too much</text>
  <text start="356.19" dur="5.11">influence and money can can create if</text>
  <text start="359.11" dur="3.69">people are hiding in the shadows with it</text>
  <text start="361.3" dur="3.69">like they&amp;#39;re doing in the deep state so</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="4.739">we have to we have to fix some of these</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="5.489">problems and that creates problems for</text>
  <text start="367.539" dur="4.921">those guys anyway so you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="370.479" dur="4.41">what it&amp;#39;s all about it&amp;#39;s about exposing</text>
  <text start="372.46" dur="5.28">the corrupt and then the elite among us</text>
  <text start="374.889" dur="4.441">and those elite have been not just</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="3.48">selling us out to Ukraine like we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="4.019">started to see with Biden and his son I</text>
  <text start="381.22" dur="3.689">mean this is just small fry so we were</text>
  <text start="383.349" dur="4.13">talking a couple million dollars before</text>
  <text start="384.909" dur="5.91">now we&amp;#39;re getting into the billions okay</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="4.75">I mean I&amp;#39;m sure that they they give some</text>
  <text start="390.819" dur="3.811">of their other kids more money than</text>
  <text start="392.229" dur="4.68">Biden and he&amp;#39;s just a crack yet right so</text>
  <text start="394.63" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;m sure that they gave many of their</text>
  <text start="396.909" dur="2.79">other kids billions</text>
  <text start="397.93" dur="3.959">he probably just gets the millions to</text>
  <text start="399.699" dur="4.171">play with because he&amp;#39;s just Sanne Biden</text>
  <text start="401.889" dur="4.53">I mean he&amp;#39;s not pretty particularly all</text>
  <text start="403.87" dur="4.049">that smart or or effective as an agent</text>
  <text start="406.419" dur="3.211">but they give him Millions</text>
  <text start="407.919" dur="3.75">but when we start to really get into</text>
  <text start="409.63" dur="3.27">this we really start to have turn back</text>
  <text start="411.669" dur="3.93">and see how many of these politicians</text>

  <text start="761.92" dur="4.71">does not establish obstruction in this</text>
  <text start="764.2" dur="4.62">case and he called into question the</text>
  <text start="766.63" dur="5.01">timing of Democrats in their push for</text>
  <text start="768.82" dur="4.47">this process asking why are you trying</text>
  <text start="771.64" dur="3.72">to break the record with fastest</text>
  <text start="773.29" dur="4.77">impeachment fast is not good for</text>
  <text start="775.36" dur="5.28">impeachment said Jonathan Turley but I</text>
  <text start="778.06" dur="4.89">think to Andy&amp;#39;s point he was Jonathan</text>
  <text start="780.64" dur="5.58">Turley was effective in his presentation</text>
  <text start="782.95" dur="6.36">clear concise and also just in the one</text>

  <text start="795.22" dur="6">your point I think when he said fast and</text>
  <text start="798.67" dur="4.59">narrow is not the way to do impeachment</text>
  <text start="801.22" dur="4.44">he said at numerous times numerous ways</text>
  <text start="803.26" dur="5.34">and bill mentioned before when he said</text>
  <text start="805.66" dur="5.04">if you make a high crime and misdemeanor</text>
  <text start="808.6" dur="5.07">out of this without going to the courts</text>

  <text start="813.67" dur="5.43">investigation to get the goods</text>
  <text start="815.5" dur="6.27">essentially to make this case then you</text>
  <text start="819.1" dur="5.43">are committing the high crime and</text>
  <text start="821.77" dur="4.29">misdemeanor as in Congress and I thought</text>
  <text start="824.53" dur="6.06">that that was the most powerful moment</text>
  <text start="826.06" dur="6.03">of his testimony indeed indeed I thought</text>
  <text start="830.59" dur="4.14">that was the clip of him actually saying</text>
  <text start="832.09" dur="4.56">it I guess not but it was still I mean</text>

  <text start="1193.05" dur="4.379">professional educator and teacher</text>
  <text start="1194.82" dur="4.92">himself and a journalist and we broke</text>
  <text start="1197.429" dur="3.451">down common core like it took an hour or</text>
  <text start="1199.74" dur="2.88">something it was a really good</text>
  <text start="1200.88" dur="4.11">conversation please check out that</text>
  <text start="1202.62" dur="5.28">interview about education with Alex</text>
  <text start="1204.99" dur="6.45">Newman on my channel you guys can search</text>
  <text start="1207.9" dur="5.94">Alex Newman any um a and a few guys are</text>
  <text start="1211.44" dur="5.07">curious about the education system and</text>
  <text start="1213.84" dur="5.52">what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s been done there now</text>
  <text start="1216.51" dur="6.24">continuing on you know Bloomberg here is</text>
  <text start="1219.36" dur="5.13">just another petty dictator ten pot kind</text>
  <text start="1222.75" dur="4.83">of guy and he thinks he can control</text>
  <text start="1224.49" dur="5.13">everyone and in New York look that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="1227.58" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s done it seems to me as an outsider</text>
  <text start="1229.62" dur="5.13">looking in that New York is compared to</text>
  <text start="1231.87" dur="5.58">most other states out there very</text>
  <text start="1234.75" dur="4.98">totalitarian it seems as though the city</text>
  <text start="1237.45" dur="5.4">itself is basically controlling the</text>
  <text start="1239.73" dur="5.13">entire state including by the way if all</text>
  <text start="1242.85" dur="3.54">of the the rural areas were not being</text>
  <text start="1244.86" dur="4.77">taxed to support the city it would fall</text>
  <text start="1246.39" dur="5.669">apart so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost a few lists</text>
  <text start="1249.63" dur="4.679">society and many work where the folks in</text>
  <text start="1252.059" dur="3.75">the city have a lot more privileges than</text>
  <text start="1254.309" dur="4.041">the folks in the rural area they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1255.809" dur="5.081">mooching off of them it&amp;#39;s not fair it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1258.35" dur="5.78">it&amp;#39;s unethical and</text>
  <text start="1260.89" dur="6.05">then of course the city itself is a iron</text>
  <text start="1264.13" dur="5.1">grip kind of top-down authoritarian</text>
  <text start="1266.94" dur="4.66">thing and that may be just because</text>
  <text start="1269.23" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re crunching billions of</text>
  <text start="1271.6" dur="3.69">people or at least millions of people</text>
  <text start="1273.79" dur="3.05">into one small area I&amp;#39;m not even sure</text>
  <text start="1275.29" dur="4.71">what the population is if New York now</text>
  <text start="1276.84" dur="5.89">so maybe you have to have you know a</text>
  <text start="1280" dur="4.2">very strong grip that way if you have so</text>
  <text start="1282.73" dur="4.44">many people in such close proximity</text>
  <text start="1284.2" dur="4.77">because you know multiculturalism and</text>
  <text start="1287.17" dur="3.99">proximity equals war so you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1288.97" dur="4.26">have different cultures different people</text>
  <text start="1291.16" dur="4.02">in a close proximity it&amp;#39;s gonna create</text>
  <text start="1293.23" dur="4.11">friction and then you&amp;#39;re gonna need ever</text>
  <text start="1295.18" dur="4.11">more government ever more control ever</text>
  <text start="1297.34" dur="3.93">more power and they get that that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1299.29" dur="3.39">they consolidate in the big cities</text>
  <text start="1301.27" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s why they try to push people into</text>
  <text start="1302.68" dur="4.62">the cities and then the cities are full</text>
  <text start="1304.45" dur="4.83">of homeless and disease and and rioting</text>
  <text start="1307.3" dur="5.64">and violence and and you don&amp;#39;t see as</text>
  <text start="1309.28" dur="5.37">much as out in the country do you i I</text>
  <text start="1312.94" dur="4.11">think that the future of the world</text>
  <text start="1314.65" dur="4.41">before we move on to Pelosi here I think</text>
  <text start="1317.05" dur="4.14">the future of the civilization you know</text>
  <text start="1319.06" dur="3.54">because she says civilization itself is</text>
  <text start="1321.19" dur="3.36">at stake in this next article</text>
  <text start="1322.6" dur="4.47">I think the future civilization is rural</text>
  <text start="1324.55" dur="4.41">you know we have fiber internet in some</text>
  <text start="1327.07" dur="4.38">of the most rural places now and a lot</text>
  <text start="1328.96" dur="5.4">of the e-commerce you know a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1331.45" dur="4.65">the jobs a lot of the business it&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="1334.36" dur="3.6">done from the comfort of your home on</text>
  <text start="1336.1" dur="4.71">the Internet and that&amp;#39;s a strange new</text>
  <text start="1337.96" dur="4.68">world about everything but I hope that</text>
  <text start="1340.81" dur="6.03">we can drain these cities and leave them</text>
  <text start="1342.64" dur="6.93">as a smoldering ruin not non smoldering</text>
  <text start="1346.84" dur="4.71">ruin but a ruin of history right people</text>
  <text start="1349.57" dur="3.66">will take trips to these cities which</text>
  <text start="1351.55" dur="3.51">are probably dilapidated and falling</text>
  <text start="1353.23" dur="4.56">apart and dangerous without a guide and</text>
  <text start="1355.06" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;ll say hey this used to be people</text>
  <text start="1357.79" dur="4.41">crammed into this this tiny space and</text>
  <text start="1360.04" dur="4.71">they were trash everywhere and germs and</text>
  <text start="1362.2" dur="4.32">no one had any privacy or space and</text>
  <text start="1364.75" dur="3.36">people are like wow that&amp;#39;s weird it must</text>
  <text start="1366.52" dur="3.27">have been really unpleasant and then</text>
  <text start="1368.11" dur="2.7">they go home to their you know ten acres</text>
  <text start="1369.79" dur="3.27">or something and they grow their own</text>
  <text start="1370.81" dur="5.31">food or or they have space to stretch</text>
  <text start="1373.06" dur="6.53">and maybe not see a neighbor and I think</text>
  <text start="1376.12" dur="5.82">that will be the future so continuing on</text>
  <text start="1379.59" dur="3.34">at least in America because Trump is</text>
  <text start="1381.94" dur="3.84">making America great again</text>
  <text start="1382.93" dur="5.31">now Pelosi says civilization itself is</text>
  <text start="1385.78" dur="6.63">at stake this is a quote if Trump wins</text>
  <text start="1388.24" dur="6.12">re-election now she says that she</text>
  <text start="1392.41" dur="2.22">doesn&amp;#39;t hate Trump that she&amp;#39;s a Catholic</text>
  <text start="1394.36" dur="1.77">and</text>
  <text start="1394.63" dur="4.2">and this is done with hearts full of</text>
  <text start="1396.13" dur="7.65">love right no we know that this is BS</text>
  <text start="1398.83" dur="7.89">let&amp;#39;s watch that is a nation a model a</text>
  <text start="1403.78" dur="6.69">beacon of hope to the world and he did</text>
  <text start="1406.72" dur="7.56">that he values that so again we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1410.47" dur="6.78">agonize we organize and we do so in a</text>
  <text start="1414.28" dur="6.87">way that again is unifying for a country</text>
  <text start="1417.25" dur="7.05">it is absolutely imperative civilization</text>
  <text start="1421.15" dur="5.46">as we know it today is at stake in the</text>
  <text start="1424.3" dur="5.22">next election and certainly our planet I</text>
  <text start="1426.61" dur="5.34">just came back I was mentioning that I</text>
  <text start="1429.52" dur="5.76">just came back from Spain I was there</text>
  <text start="1431.95" dur="7.29">for 48 hours for the climate crisis that</text>

  <text start="1450.79" dur="2.81">we&amp;#39;re still</text>

  <text start="1459.86" dur="4.949">president which i think is I think</text>

  <text start="1464.809" dur="3.811">you&amp;#39;re basically trying to overrule our</text>
  <text start="1466.85" dur="2.73">president statements that we&amp;#39;re leaving</text>

  <text start="1474.32" dur="3.839">commander in chief just told them so why</text>
  <text start="1476.69" dur="3.239">would you do that and then how is that</text>
  <text start="1478.159" dur="4.831">illegal because I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that it</text>
  <text start="1479.929" dur="5.97">is anyway it seems like a seditious</text>
  <text start="1482.99" dur="4.62">thing to do now continuing on of course</text>
  <text start="1485.899" dur="4.321">I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this in the queue and on</text>

  <text start="1580.58" dur="4.439">why do they constantly make fun of it</text>
  <text start="1582.98" dur="4.89">why do they constantly come after it I</text>
  <text start="1585.019" dur="4.381">mean we saw numerous examples</text>
  <text start="1587.87" dur="3.72">on twitter with blue checkmarks from</text>
  <text start="1589.4" dur="4.53">various big fake news types promoting</text>

  <text start="1599.24" dur="4.53">question if you really think about it is</text>
  <text start="1601.07" dur="3.84">well either it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s nothing and they</text>
  <text start="1603.77" dur="2.64">shouldn&amp;#39;t worry about it or it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1604.91" dur="3.66">something that they&amp;#39;re afraid of and</text>

  <text start="1610.16" dur="5.49">most right so this is very telling and</text>
