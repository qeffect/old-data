  <text start="125.56" dur="7.709">their support for us in our first story</text>
  <text start="130.69" dur="5.909">Democrats refused to let the Russian</text>
  <text start="133.269" dur="6">investigation die so now Jerry Nadler</text>
  <text start="136.599" dur="4.801">has moved forward and final civil</text>
  <text start="139.269" dur="3.931">lawsuit to enforce a subpoena for</text>
  <text start="141.4" dur="3.21">testimony from Don Magan who is the</text>
  <text start="143.2" dur="4.679">former White House Counsel</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="7.86">now they&amp;#39;re after his testimony because</text>
  <text start="147.879" dur="8.461">they want to hang on to this obstruction</text>
  <text start="152.47" dur="8.04">of justice accusation even though there</text>
  <text start="156.34" dur="6.82">is no obstruction of justice but because</text>
  <text start="160.51" dur="5.89">they feel they have a glimmer of hope</text>
  <text start="163.16" dur="6.78">and in the second part of the Muller</text>
  <text start="166.4" dur="5.88">report it wasn&amp;#39;t stated one way or the</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="3.81">other whether or not he was guilty which</text>
  <text start="172.28" dur="4.89">of course at this point we already</text>
  <text start="173.75" dur="7.14">understand that if President Trump was</text>
  <text start="177.17" dur="6.15">not prosecuted for obstruction of</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="4.97">justice that he is innocent because</text>
  <text start="183.32" dur="6.84">there is a presumption of innocence</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="8.23">according to the law but they want to</text>
  <text start="190.16" dur="5.61">make it appear that he is guilty so they</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="8.07">are going to continue to beat a dead</text>
  <text start="195.77" dur="9.48">horse now dawn McGann was said to have</text>
  <text start="202.16" dur="8.31">been told by President Trump that he</text>
  <text start="205.25" dur="8.88">should fire Muller now did he fire</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="7.59">Mahler no president Trump did not fire</text>
  <text start="214.13" dur="6.48">Muller so therefore even if it was maybe</text>
  <text start="218.06" dur="4.89">a thought that was thrown out there he</text>
  <text start="220.61" dur="5.79">didn&amp;#39;t take action no action was taken</text>
  <text start="222.95" dur="6.75">and really this idea was likely thrown</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="6">out there because he knew that he was</text>
  <text start="229.7" dur="7.41">innocent the whole Russian investigation</text>
  <text start="232.4" dur="7.53">was a sham so he ultimately didn&amp;#39;t end</text>
  <text start="237.11" dur="6.42">up firing him because he was likely</text>
  <text start="239.93" dur="6.54">advised that it could look bad for him</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="5.16">if he did do that so even though</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="6.84">President Trump hadn&amp;#39;t committed any</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="9.09">crime he did not collude with Russia he</text>
  <text start="253.31" dur="9.51">did not conspire with Russia he needed</text>
  <text start="257.78" dur="7.41">to let the investigation play out so he</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="4.98">didn&amp;#39;t fire him now this is the only</text>
  <text start="265.19" dur="5.43">thing that the Democrats have to go on</text>
  <text start="267.8" dur="5.67">as far as obstruction of justice is</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="5.16">concerned they think that this is the</text>
  <text start="273.47" dur="4.32">nail in the coffin they say that he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="275.78" dur="6.05">key witness and that they need to have</text>
  <text start="277.79" dur="7.92">him testify publicly now as of right now</text>
  <text start="281.83" dur="6.61">he is not set to testify publicly and he</text>
  <text start="285.71" dur="4.32">is instead handed over several documents</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="2.88">for them to comb through to see if</text>
  <text start="290.03" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s anything in there that they can</text>
  <text start="291.32" dur="5.58">use but really what they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="295.49" dur="4.399">is his test him</text>
  <text start="296.9" dur="7.019">which really won&amp;#39;t do anything the molar</text>
  <text start="299.889" dur="7.87">investigation is dead it has now been</text>
  <text start="303.919" dur="7.59">determined that President Trump nor</text>
  <text start="307.759" dur="8.641">anyone else within his campaign no one</text>
  <text start="311.509" dur="7.051">had colluded with the Russians on the</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="4.41">side of the Trump campaign but of course</text>
  <text start="318.56" dur="4.5">there is plenty of Russian collusion on</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="5.28">the side of the Hillary campaign which</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="7.829">of course they are right now at this</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="7.74">moment investigating but they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="5.28">to project this idea of guilt onto</text>
  <text start="333.83" dur="4.08">president Trump which is not going to</text>
  <text start="336.169" dur="4.201">work now it&amp;#39;s interesting that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="4.14">trying to scrutinize them so much for</text>
  <text start="340.37" dur="5.19">obstruction of justice when they barely</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="5.339">have any piece of evidence yet there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.56" dur="3.93">plenty of evidence on the side of</text>
  <text start="347.389" dur="7.041">Hillary Clinton that there was</text>
  <text start="349.49" dur="8.25">definitely a parent and very evidence</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="7.019">obstruction of justice when you talk</text>
  <text start="357.74" dur="6.87">about bleach bidding when you talk about</text>
  <text start="361.449" dur="5.321">smashing phones with hammers if you</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="6.839">smash a phone with a hammer you are</text>
  <text start="366.77" dur="7.29">definitely trying to hide something this</text>
  <text start="371.449" dur="6.78">is blatant obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="6.63">now Comey is likely going to be in a lot</text>
  <text start="378.229" dur="6.421">of trouble now some people were upset</text>
  <text start="380.69" dur="7.14">because there was not a recommendation</text>
  <text start="384.65" dur="7.079">for criminal charges to be filed against</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="5.82">Comey for leaking of information but</text>
  <text start="391.729" dur="6.541">what they said was that there wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="9.78">enough concrete evidence for that charge</text>
  <text start="398.27" dur="7.5">and that they needed to ensure that any</text>
  <text start="403.43" dur="4.38">charge that they made because of course</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="4.56">everything is going to be politicized at</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="4.859">this point it needed to be airtight and</text>
  <text start="410.33" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;ve said this for a while now that</text>
  <text start="412.669" dur="4.62">anything that they do any charges that</text>
  <text start="414.77" dur="4.679">they bring needs to be airtight there</text>
  <text start="417.289" dur="5.971">needs to be definitive evidence there</text>
  <text start="419.449" dur="6.001">that this person can be charged with a</text>
  <text start="423.26" dur="5.14">crime and that there will be no shadow</text>
  <text start="425.45" dur="4.96">of a doubt that they are guilty</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="5.48">because if there&amp;#39;s a shadow of a doubt</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="8.31">that they&amp;#39;re guilty then they will walk</text>
  <text start="433.88" dur="8.259">so now they&amp;#39;re looking at what did the</text>
  <text start="438.72" dur="7.29">FBI do and the DOJ what did they do to</text>
  <text start="442.139" dur="9.391">assist Hillary Clinton in her cover-up</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="8.04">of her 33 thousand emails that were on</text>
  <text start="451.53" dur="7.47">her private server that were supposed to</text>
  <text start="454.05" dur="7.35">be classified now ultimately Comey came</text>
  <text start="459" dur="4.889">out and made a public statement and said</text>
  <text start="461.4" dur="5.519">that he there wasn&amp;#39;t enough there to</text>
  <text start="463.889" dur="8.31">bring charges against her and that she</text>
  <text start="466.919" dur="7.321">had really just been careless in her</text>
  <text start="472.199" dur="4.44">handling of the emails extremely</text>
  <text start="474.24" dur="5.94">careless which really is the same thing</text>
  <text start="476.639" dur="6.78">as grossly negligent which is the</text>
  <text start="480.18" dur="5.28">language necessary to bring a criminal</text>
  <text start="483.419" dur="4.141">charge but because they change the</text>
  <text start="485.46" dur="5.489">wording then they apparently don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="487.56" dur="7.95">to bring a criminal charge so they did a</text>
  <text start="490.949" dur="7.501">lot in an effort to help Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="495.51" dur="5.219">now Comey was the head of the FBI at the</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="5.82">time and the FBI during their</text>
  <text start="500.729" dur="5.12">investigation they had destroyed the</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="5.34">evidence</text>
  <text start="505.849" dur="6.87">at the order of the one who they were</text>
  <text start="509.61" dur="6.21">investigating when does this ever happen</text>
  <text start="512.719" dur="8.38">this never happened it&amp;#39;s just like when</text>
  <text start="515.82" dur="9.62">Peter Schrock was under fire for his</text>
  <text start="521.099" dur="8.311">biased acts against President Trump and</text>
  <text start="525.44" dur="6.43">how when he had to hand over all of his</text>
  <text start="529.41" dur="5.67">text messages so that they could comb</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="5.7">through them for evidence of this he was</text>
  <text start="535.08" dur="6.99">able to tell them which texts were</text>
  <text start="537.57" dur="7.56">relevant and which ones were not are you</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="5.639">kidding me of course the criminal is</text>
  <text start="545.13" dur="5.64">going to tell you that the text that</text>
  <text start="547.709" dur="9.091">incriminate him the most those ones are</text>
  <text start="550.77" dur="9">not relevant if you give the criminal</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="4.25">the chance to choose which pieces of</text>
  <text start="559.77" dur="3.08">evidence</text>
  <text start="561.05" dur="3.87">are going to be available then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="562.85" dur="6.42">going to pick the ones that make it look</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="8.76">like they haven&amp;#39;t done anything wrong so</text>
  <text start="569.27" dur="9.36">just like in this case where she</text>
  <text start="573.68" dur="7.07">directed the FBI and the DOJ to destroy</text>
  <text start="578.63" dur="5.76">the evidence once they&amp;#39;ve looked at it</text>
  <text start="580.75" dur="6.1">okay here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the evidence but make</text>
  <text start="584.39" dur="6.36">sure it&amp;#39;s destroyed after you go through</text>
  <text start="586.85" dur="5.61">it oh and also by the way you&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="590.75" dur="4.68">allowed to look at this part and this</text>
  <text start="592.46" dur="10.41">part and that&amp;#39;s it which is really what</text>
  <text start="595.43" dur="9.72">happened so Cheryl Mills who was her</text>
  <text start="602.87" dur="7.5">chief of staff while she was Secretary</text>
  <text start="605.15" dur="10.34">of State and who had helped in covering</text>
  <text start="610.37" dur="10.95">up the email scandal was given an</text>
  <text start="615.49" dur="7.98">immunity deal then after that became</text>
  <text start="621.32" dur="5.1">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s counsel</text>
  <text start="623.47" dur="7.42">so when Hillary Clinton was questioned</text>
  <text start="626.42" dur="9.3">not under oath Cheryl Mills who is now</text>
  <text start="630.89" dur="6.78">her counsel was also present this is a</text>
  <text start="635.72" dur="4.77">huge conflict of interest and she wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="637.67" dur="4.77">the only one and so there were two</text>
  <text start="640.49" dur="5.19">people who were part of Hillary</text>
  <text start="642.44" dur="8.64">Clinton&amp;#39;s staff who were involved in the</text>
  <text start="645.68" dur="8.55">cover-up of this email scandal and they</text>
  <text start="651.08" dur="6.069">were given immunity deals and then they</text>
  <text start="654.23" dur="6.799">became her counsel</text>
  <text start="657.149" dur="7.301">well also at the same time the server</text>
  <text start="661.029" dur="6.451">which is the evidence they did not grant</text>
  <text start="664.45" dur="6.06">the FBI and the DOJ custody and control</text>
  <text start="667.48" dur="6.69">over that evidence so it couldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="670.51" dur="5.72">been searched because they did not have</text>
  <text start="674.17" dur="5.34">possession of it</text>
  <text start="676.23" dur="6.46">when they finally did hand over custody</text>
  <text start="679.51" dur="6.51">and control to the FBI and the DOJ they</text>
  <text start="682.69" dur="5.64">told them hey so you&amp;#39;re going to look at</text>
  <text start="686.02" dur="4.59">these pieces of evidence you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="688.33" dur="5.129">look at this time frame but not that and</text>
  <text start="690.61" dur="5.64">so the FBI was not allowed to do a</text>
  <text start="693.459" dur="7.921">thorough investigation on all of her</text>
  <text start="696.25" dur="7.41">emails they of course were probably told</text>
  <text start="701.38" dur="4.2">to look at things that obviously would</text>
  <text start="703.66" dur="4.38">not incriminate Hillary Clinton at all</text>
  <text start="705.58" dur="3.75">so then after they were told which</text>
  <text start="708.04" dur="3.45">things they could look at and which</text>
  <text start="709.33" dur="4.44">things they could not by the criminal</text>
  <text start="711.49" dur="4.289">who&amp;#39;s being investigated then they were</text>
  <text start="713.77" dur="4.23">also told by that same criminal to</text>
  <text start="715.779" dur="8.221">destroy the evidence using bleach bit</text>
  <text start="718" dur="8.459">and a hammer for the phones then right</text>
  <text start="724" dur="4.709">after that that&amp;#39;s when Comey came out</text>
  <text start="726.459" dur="4.231">and made the statement saying that</text>
  <text start="728.709" dur="6.361">Hillary Clinton was not going to be</text>
  <text start="730.69" dur="7.35">charged so after helping her destroy</text>
  <text start="735.07" dur="7.49">evidence they then said that she was not</text>
  <text start="738.04" dur="7.739">going to be charged this is criminal and</text>
  <text start="742.56" dur="4.93">Comey is going to be in a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="745.779" dur="6.601">for this because he was head of the FBI</text>
  <text start="747.49" dur="6.87">at this time so he should be sweating</text>
  <text start="752.38" dur="5.31">right now all right</text>
  <text start="754.36" dur="6.69">in other news president Trump has just</text>
  <text start="757.69" dur="5.91">finished his visit to Dayton Ohio and El</text>
  <text start="761.05" dur="5.67">Paso after the mass shootings that had</text>
  <text start="763.6" dur="5.7">just happened so he stayed generally out</text>
  <text start="766.72" dur="4.23">of the public and media view he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="769.3" dur="3.96">want to make this a photo op he really</text>
  <text start="770.95" dur="4.949">just went there to give his condolences</text>
  <text start="773.26" dur="5.579">to the victims and the families and to</text>
  <text start="775.899" dur="8.25">really thank the first responders who</text>
  <text start="778.839" dur="7.801">were there and he did a great job so he</text>
  <text start="784.149" dur="4.081">was well-received by the victims and</text>
  <text start="786.64" dur="2.41">families and first responders but of</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="5.26">course</text>
  <text start="789.05" dur="6.84">the leaders who were there did not</text>
  <text start="793.49" dur="7.94">really welcome his visit as much and of</text>
  <text start="795.89" dur="8.69">course the mayor of Dayton had really</text>
  <text start="801.43" dur="6.31">criticized his presence there and</text>
  <text start="804.58" dur="7.03">criticized the fact that he didn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="807.74" dur="5.7">with strict gun laws points of action</text>
  <text start="811.61" dur="3.66">for gun laws because she says that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="813.44" dur="7.41">what they were really looking for they</text>
  <text start="815.27" dur="9.81">wanted action well here&amp;#39;s the thing he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="820.85" dur="9.62">not going to enact gun laws immediately</text>
  <text start="825.08" dur="9.84">after mass shooting mass shootings are</text>
  <text start="830.47" dur="10">very emotionally charged and so when</text>
  <text start="834.92" dur="9.39">you&amp;#39;re trying to reform laws you cannot</text>
  <text start="840.47" dur="11.73">do so when you are only thinking</text>
  <text start="844.31" dur="10.14">emotionally because the problem here is</text>
  <text start="852.2" dur="4.8">that when people think about this</text>
  <text start="854.45" dur="5.639">emotionally they think that gun laws are</text>
  <text start="857" dur="5.81">going to be the end-all be-all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="860.089" dur="7.31">going to solve the problem it does not</text>
  <text start="862.81" dur="8.92">gun laws will not solve the problem and</text>
  <text start="867.399" dur="7.511">so also president Trump has taken a lot</text>
  <text start="871.73" dur="6.96">of flack for talking about how he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.91" dur="5.64">looking at red flag laws and other gun</text>
  <text start="878.69" dur="3.72">control measures and of course that</text>
  <text start="880.55" dur="5.19">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that he&amp;#39;s going to enact</text>
  <text start="882.41" dur="5.989">them it means that he&amp;#39;s taking a look at</text>
  <text start="885.74" dur="5.159">all of the options this is where</text>
  <text start="888.399" dur="6.19">activists really needs to appeal to</text>
  <text start="890.899" dur="5.601">President Trump and explain that this is</text>
  <text start="894.589" dur="7.201">not the answer</text>
  <text start="896.5" dur="9.579">gun control is not the answer now he did</text>
  <text start="901.79" dur="8.39">talk about a few other issues that need</text>
  <text start="906.079" dur="9.351">to be looked at so for example harsher</text>
  <text start="910.18" dur="8.08">sentences so the death penalty and</text>
  <text start="915.43" dur="6.23">ensuring that the death penalty when</text>
  <text start="918.26" dur="5.47">someone is placed on death row</text>
  <text start="921.66" dur="4.83">or this type of crime they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="923.73" dur="7.26">sitting on death row waiting it out</text>
  <text start="926.49" dur="10.59">wasting tax dollars they are executed</text>
  <text start="930.99" dur="8.07">quickly this type of law may deter some</text>
  <text start="937.08" dur="6">people from committing this crime</text>
  <text start="939.06" dur="7.23">however I would also argue that a lot of</text>
  <text start="943.08" dur="5.34">these people have something going on</text>
  <text start="946.29" dur="8.84">mentally and we talked about this</text>
  <text start="948.42" dur="9.75">yesterday where all of the shooters have</text>
  <text start="955.13" dur="5.65">one thing in common and that&amp;#39;s that they</text>
  <text start="958.17" dur="6.03">were on psychotropic medications so they</text>
  <text start="960.78" dur="8.28">have mental health problems and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="964.2" dur="6.96">on psychotropic drugs so there seems to</text>
  <text start="969.06" dur="4.92">be a correlation there and if there is</text>
  <text start="971.16" dur="5.7">then it needs to be addressed they need</text>
  <text start="973.98" dur="5.37">to look into this further and figure out</text>
  <text start="976.86" dur="8.01">what we need to do to address mental</text>
  <text start="979.35" dur="11.04">health in this country because the guns</text>
  <text start="984.87" dur="7.83">are not the problem so again the mayor</text>
  <text start="990.39" dur="4.5">of Dayton she was not happy because he</text>
  <text start="992.7" dur="3.57">didn&amp;#39;t bring with him gun control</text>
  <text start="994.89" dur="3.33">measures that he was going to enact</text>
  <text start="996.27" dur="5.15">right then that&amp;#39;s what she wasn&amp;#39;t happy</text>
  <text start="998.22" dur="6.9">with now in El Paso</text>
  <text start="1001.42" dur="5.53">he was also welcomed by the victims and</text>
  <text start="1005.12" dur="4.44">the families and some of the victims who</text>
  <text start="1006.95" dur="5.58">were not in hospital where he attended</text>
  <text start="1009.56" dur="7.86">they had showed up to meet with the</text>
  <text start="1012.53" dur="7.56">president and he was supported by most</text>
  <text start="1017.42" dur="4.32">people who he went to see and so there</text>
  <text start="1020.09" dur="3.9">were some people who were not so happy</text>
  <text start="1021.74" dur="3.9">that he had come to visit El Paso</text>
  <text start="1023.99" dur="5.7">including Representative Veronica</text>
  <text start="1025.64" dur="5.91">Escobar who said that she was not going</text>
  <text start="1029.69" dur="3.63">to meet with him that she refused to</text>
  <text start="1031.55" dur="5.6">meet with him and even said so in a</text>
  <text start="1033.32" dur="6.96">tweet and instead took a call from him</text>
  <text start="1037.15" dur="4.99">she said that his rhetoric is what</text>
  <text start="1040.28" dur="6.99">caused this and that he was not welcome</text>
  <text start="1042.14" dur="7.05">and of course the mayor he did act a</text>
  <text start="1047.27" dur="3.23">little bit more maturely and said that</text>
  <text start="1049.19" dur="4.61">he would meet</text>
  <text start="1050.5" dur="6.75">president Trump citing the fact that as</text>
  <text start="1053.8" dur="7.62">mayor it is a responsibility to try to</text>
  <text start="1057.25" dur="7.71">work with the president which is true</text>
  <text start="1061.42" dur="6.24">and really you know if you don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="1064.96" dur="6.56">with the president if you have some kind</text>
  <text start="1067.66" dur="7.56">of issue then how are you going to even</text>
  <text start="1071.52" dur="5.92">think about getting that issue resolved</text>
  <text start="1075.22" dur="6.11">if you refuse to even meet with the</text>
  <text start="1077.44" dur="7.29">president to tell him what the issue is</text>
  <text start="1081.33" dur="6.49">you cannot complain when you don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1084.73" dur="8.1">make an effort to resolve a situation so</text>
  <text start="1087.82" dur="9.27">really all this is about politics they</text>
  <text start="1092.83" dur="8.4">want to perpetuate this division it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1097.09" dur="7.41">politically motivated while this should</text>
  <text start="1101.23" dur="6.02">be a time that that leaders can really</text>
  <text start="1104.5" dur="7.64">sit down together and cooperate</text>
  <text start="1107.25" dur="8.17">especially when it comes to really</text>
  <text start="1112.14" dur="9.58">mourning with this town that has just</text>
  <text start="1115.42" dur="9.84">been touched by incredible violence this</text>
  <text start="1121.72" dur="9.33">is not the place for political fights</text>
  <text start="1125.26" dur="8.52">and so kudos to Trump for visiting the</text>
  <text start="1131.05" dur="5.73">families and victims and first</text>
  <text start="1133.78" dur="6.78">responders of Dayton Ohio and El Paso</text>
  <text start="1136.78" dur="6.63">Texas kudos to him for going even though</text>
  <text start="1140.56" dur="4.56">the leaders had really pushed back and</text>
  <text start="1143.41" dur="7.32">tried to tell him that he was not</text>
  <text start="1145.12" dur="7.56">welcome so he went anyway and thank</text>
  <text start="1150.73" dur="4.95">goodness he did that because way back</text>
  <text start="1152.68" dur="6.15">when during his candidacy when the pulse</text>
  <text start="1155.68" dur="7.56">shooting it happened he wanted to go to</text>
  <text start="1158.83" dur="8.19">Orlando that very week and ended up</text>
  <text start="1163.24" dur="11.43">canceling because the city worked so</text>
  <text start="1167.02" dur="9.72">hard against him coming hugely petty but</text>
  <text start="1174.67" dur="5.4">kudos to President Trump for actually</text>
  <text start="1176.74" dur="5.939">being the mature one all right in other</text>
  <text start="1180.07" dur="4.229">news this is really good news thousands</text>
  <text start="1182.679" dur="3.54">of ex-prisoners are too</text>
  <text start="1184.299" dur="5.18">reunite with their families this month</text>
  <text start="1186.219" dur="7.65">as part of first step act so this is</text>
  <text start="1189.479" dur="7.841">really the cornerstone of his prison</text>
  <text start="1193.869" dur="6.63">reform so the prison reform is something</text>
  <text start="1197.32" dur="5.88">that they have a tent or said that they</text>
  <text start="1200.499" dur="5.49">have attempted for 25 years and have not</text>
  <text start="1203.2" dur="6.389">been successful President Trump on the</text>
  <text start="1205.989" dur="8.57">other hand has really put forward a</text>
  <text start="1209.589" dur="9.03">program that is going to really help in</text>
  <text start="1214.559" dur="7.27">stopping the cycle that these people end</text>
  <text start="1218.619" dur="5.55">up being in they end up circulating</text>
  <text start="1221.829" dur="5.85">within the system even if they never get</text>
  <text start="1224.169" dur="5.521">a life sentence because a lot of these</text>
  <text start="1227.679" dur="5.1">people who end up in the criminal</text>
  <text start="1229.69" dur="4.739">justice system they go to jail they come</text>
  <text start="1232.779" dur="4.08">out after six months or a year or</text>
  <text start="1234.429" dur="4.65">whenever and they have a hard time</text>
  <text start="1236.859" dur="4.74">finding work they have a hard time</text>
  <text start="1239.079" dur="4.89">getting an apartment or a house they</text>
  <text start="1241.599" dur="4.77">have a hard time in a lot of ways they</text>
  <text start="1243.969" dur="4.86">face a lot of barriers and so then what</text>
  <text start="1246.369" dur="4.71">ends up happening is is that it&amp;#39;s easier</text>
  <text start="1248.829" dur="4.47">to be a criminal so then they resort to</text>
  <text start="1251.079" dur="4.29">returning to their criminal ways and</text>
  <text start="1253.299" dur="4.32">then they end up right back in prison</text>
  <text start="1255.369" dur="7.11">and then they do this over and over and</text>
  <text start="1257.619" dur="13.28">over again and this largely affects</text>
  <text start="1262.479" dur="12.45">black communities so with this program</text>
  <text start="1270.899" dur="7.03">it allows those who have shown good</text>
  <text start="1274.929" dur="7.2">behavior to finish out their sentences</text>
  <text start="1277.929" dur="6.72">early and not only that but along with</text>
  <text start="1282.129" dur="4.62">the first-step Act there is a second</text>
  <text start="1284.649" dur="5.85">chances program which really is a</text>
  <text start="1286.749" dur="9.06">partnership between the criminal justice</text>
  <text start="1290.499" dur="9.48">system the public prisons and private</text>
  <text start="1295.809" dur="7.68">companies partnerships in order to</text>
  <text start="1299.979" dur="6.24">ensure that there are work opportunities</text>
  <text start="1303.489" dur="5.67">for these individuals when they come out</text>
  <text start="1306.219" dur="4.77">and so goodwill is one of those</text>
  <text start="1309.159" dur="3.93">companies that has really stepped</text>
  <text start="1310.989" dur="4.35">forward and said that they are going to</text>
  <text start="1313.089" dur="4.291">take the initiative and take part in</text>
  <text start="1315.339" dur="3.571">this program so this is a really</text>
  <text start="1317.38" dur="4.65">really good thing because you know</text>
  <text start="1318.91" dur="4.98">sometimes people make a mistake and we</text>
  <text start="1322.03" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t want them to keep repeating this</text>
  <text start="1323.89" dur="4.65">mistake because they face too many</text>
  <text start="1325.48" dur="4.5">barriers now also he said that as part</text>
  <text start="1328.54" dur="4.8">of this program he really wants to</text>
  <text start="1329.98" dur="6.09">eliminate the barriers to housing as</text>
  <text start="1333.34" dur="5.76">well so when you think about it when you</text>
  <text start="1336.07" dur="5.25">apply for an apartment or a home to rent</text>
  <text start="1339.1" dur="4.86">a home you have to answer the question</text>
  <text start="1341.32" dur="7.05">whether or not you were convicted of a</text>
  <text start="1343.96" dur="5.94">crime so I&amp;#39;m not really sure exactly how</text>
  <text start="1348.37" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s going to address this</text>
  <text start="1349.9" dur="5.94">I could make some guesses but I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1353.08" dur="4.32">going to do that right now but I I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1355.84" dur="6.23">interested to see what he&amp;#39;s gonna do to</text>
  <text start="1357.4" dur="8.82">address that because what he&amp;#39;s doing now</text>
  <text start="1362.07" dur="7.69">this is a good thing we want people to</text>
  <text start="1366.22" dur="5.43">come out reformed we want them to come</text>
  <text start="1369.76" dur="4.26">out and be productive members of society</text>
  <text start="1371.65" dur="6.81">we don&amp;#39;t want to keep them down we want</text>
  <text start="1374.02" dur="9.06">to lift them up so this is really a</text>
  <text start="1378.46" dur="6.69">great thing okay other news the Boy</text>

  <text start="1441.85" dur="4.2">rather interesting so I&amp;#39;m gonna look</text>
  <text start="1444.37" dur="3.51">into this a little bit further but at</text>
  <text start="1446.05" dur="3.45">that time I had said that it was likely</text>

  <text start="1554.71" dur="10.05">and now they&amp;#39;re awaiting deportation so</text>
  <text start="1558.46" dur="9.349">this is a good thing because we cannot</text>
  <text start="1564.76" dur="5.61">allow people to stay here illegally and</text>
  <text start="1567.809" dur="4.87">of course we know at this point that</text>
  <text start="1570.37" dur="5.36">those who were targeted for deportation</text>
  <text start="1572.679" dur="5.071">are those who have already been</text>
  <text start="1575.73" dur="3.929">processed they&amp;#39;ve already had their</text>
  <text start="1577.75" dur="4.71">hearings and they&amp;#39;ve already been denied</text>
  <text start="1579.659" dur="3.341">their stay so they&amp;#39;ve been told to go</text>
  <text start="1582.46" dur="2.64">back</text>
  <text start="1583" dur="5.82">and they refuse to leave they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1585.1" dur="5.91">here and so they have to go if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1588.82" dur="4.89">not willing to obey the laws then they</text>
  <text start="1591.01" dur="4.83">have to leave now of course the</text>
  <text start="1593.71" dur="5.25">assistant director for the Mississippi</text>
  <text start="1595.84" dur="6.719">immigration Alliance has said that this</text>
  <text start="1598.96" dur="5.76">is really just a ploy to get Latinos out</text>
  <text start="1602.559" dur="7.411">of Mississippi and that it&amp;#39;s racially</text>
  <text start="1604.72" dur="7.5">motivated this is something they love to</text>
  <text start="1609.97" dur="5.28">pool all the time the race card it has</text>
  <text start="1612.22" dur="7.1">nothing to do with race and it has</text>
  <text start="1615.25" dur="8.85">everything to do with breaking the law</text>
  <text start="1619.32" dur="7.93">yes the majority of illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="1624.1" dur="6.35">are Latino but that&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1627.25" dur="8.63">coming from Mexico and Central America</text>
  <text start="1630.45" dur="8.53">there are some who are middle-eastern or</text>
  <text start="1635.88" dur="6.07">African but for the most part they are</text>
  <text start="1638.98" dur="5.79">let&amp;#39;s you know but it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="1641.95" dur="5.81">it&amp;#39;s racially motivated it has</text>
  <text start="1644.77" dur="6.11">everything to do with breaking the law</text>
  <text start="1647.76" dur="5.95">president Trump has nothing against</text>
  <text start="1650.88" dur="5.289">immigrants and he has even stated that</text>
  <text start="1653.71" dur="5.969">we need immigrants we need legal</text>
  <text start="1656.169" dur="5.64">immigrants because we do have a booming</text>
  <text start="1659.679" dur="5.161">economy right now and we do have</text>
  <text start="1661.809" dur="6.061">companies that are moving here that need</text>
  <text start="1664.84" dur="4.98">employees qualified employees he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1667.87" dur="4.85">saying that immigrants do offer a lot</text>
  <text start="1669.82" dur="6.089">they contribute a lot to this country he</text>
  <text start="1672.72" dur="5.62">has nothing against legal immigration he</text>
  <text start="1675.909" dur="4.921">does have something to say about those</text>
  <text start="1678.34" dur="5.94">who want to come here illegally you</text>
  <text start="1680.83" dur="8.099">cannot break the law if you break the</text>
  <text start="1684.28" dur="7.379">law you have to leave and of course you</text>
  <text start="1688.929" dur="5.071">know in this article they had even made</text>
  <text start="1691.659" dur="4.531">it a point to mention how a 13 year old</text>
  <text start="1694" dur="7.169">boy had to watch his mother being taken</text>
  <text start="1696.19" dur="7.38">off but here&amp;#39;s the thing the same thing</text>
  <text start="1701.169" dur="4.351">happens when American citizens break the</text>
  <text start="1703.57" dur="7.29">law and they have their children with</text>
  <text start="1705.52" dur="8.73">them they&amp;#39;re also separated because you</text>
  <text start="1710.86" dur="5.61">should have thought of that if you cared</text>
  <text start="1714.25" dur="3.36">about keeping your family together</text>
  <text start="1716.47" dur="3.12">you would make sure that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1717.61" dur="5.82">following the law so you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1719.59" dur="6.03">run that risk so I don&amp;#39;t feel sorry for</text>
  <text start="1723.43" dur="5.37">anyone who is separated from their</text>
  <text start="1725.62" dur="5.31">family because they broke the law your</text>
  <text start="1728.8" dur="4.47">child is not going to make you immune</text>
  <text start="1730.93" dur="2.88">from being held accountable for breaking</text>
  <text start="1733.27" dur="3.39">the law</text>
  <text start="1733.81" dur="6.48">so these raids are likely going to</text>
  <text start="1736.66" dur="6.21">continue and of course this raid is well</text>
  <text start="1740.29" dur="5.28">outside of the weekend that they had</text>
  <text start="1742.87" dur="4.74">advertised there were going to be raids</text>
  <text start="1745.57" dur="6.35">and that was a good thing because of</text>
  <text start="1747.61" dur="7.29">course you know if you make these raids</text>
  <text start="1751.92" dur="7.39">announced then people are going to hide</text>
  <text start="1754.9" dur="6.87">and you&amp;#39;re not going to be able to round</text>
  <text start="1759.31" dur="7.56">up anyone all right</text>
  <text start="1761.77" dur="9.03">in other news so in the argument for gun</text>
  <text start="1766.87" dur="7.65">control or against gun control this</text>
  <text start="1770.8" dur="8.46">makes a very good point so there was a</text>
  <text start="1774.52" dur="9.24">man who killed four and injured two in a</text>
  <text start="1779.26" dur="9.36">mass stabbing he did not use a gun he</text>
  <text start="1783.76" dur="8.85">used a knife so are they going to ban</text>
  <text start="1788.62" dur="6">guns and knives because like I said</text>
  <text start="1792.61" dur="4.2">before a killer will always find a</text>
  <text start="1794.62" dur="4.8">weapon it does not matter what the</text>
  <text start="1796.81" dur="4.74">weapon is if they want to go out and</text>
  <text start="1799.42" dur="5.1">harm people they&amp;#39;re going to find a way</text>
  <text start="1801.55" dur="6.69">to do it and the thing is the guy who</text>
  <text start="1804.52" dur="6.65">did this he actually had a gun also but</text>
  <text start="1808.24" dur="8.94">he didn&amp;#39;t use the gun he used the knife</text>
  <text start="1811.17" dur="8.8">so he went on this crime spree where it</text>
  <text start="1817.18" dur="6.18">was a mixture between attempted</text>
  <text start="1819.97" dur="8.43">robberies and just attacking random</text>
  <text start="1823.36" dur="7.92">people now they&amp;#39;re going to paint this</text>
  <text start="1828.4" dur="6.83">as also being racially motivated because</text>
  <text start="1831.28" dur="6.87">all of the victims here were Hispanic</text>
  <text start="1835.23" dur="5.41">but of course again this is in Orange</text>
  <text start="1838.15" dur="7.35">County in California where there is a</text>
  <text start="1840.64" dur="7.02">huge concentration of Latinos so the</text>
  <text start="1845.5" dur="3.87">chances are if you&amp;#39;re out there and</text>
  <text start="1847.66" dur="2.58">you&amp;#39;re attacking people randomly the</text>
  <text start="1849.37" dur="3.39">chances that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1850.24" dur="7.34">to attack a Latino are pretty high in</text>
  <text start="1852.76" dur="7.77">that area now they do mention one time</text>
  <text start="1857.58" dur="5.08">that the man who did this was also</text>
  <text start="1860.53" dur="8.55">Latino but they&amp;#39;re not going to focus on</text>
  <text start="1862.66" dur="9.24">that so I&amp;#39;ll be watching this to see</text>
  <text start="1869.08" dur="6.24">where they take this story but really</text>
  <text start="1871.9" dur="6.72">what this is is a guy who just went</text>
  <text start="1875.32" dur="8.01">completely crazy he was likely not</text>
  <text start="1878.62" dur="7.439">mentally stable because there was no</text>
  <text start="1883.33" dur="7.71">rhyme or reason to any of the tax that</text>
  <text start="1886.059" dur="9.12">he made he attempted to rob two</text>
  <text start="1891.04" dur="7.83">locations randomly attacked someone at a</text>
  <text start="1895.179" dur="6.63">gas station randomly attacks someone in</text>
  <text start="1898.87" dur="7.43">the street this was not someone who had</text>
  <text start="1901.809" dur="4.491">any kind of sense about him at all so</text>
  <text start="1907.86" dur="6.84">again this really demonstrates that gun</text>
  <text start="1911.62" dur="3.08">control is not going to work</text>
  <text start="1915.09" dur="5.02">violent criminals will always find a way</text>
  <text start="1917.41" dur="5.01">and in fact this violent criminal who</text>
  <text start="1920.11" dur="6.99">had both a gun and a knife chose to use</text>
  <text start="1922.42" dur="10.889">the knife instead this is a mental</text>
  <text start="1927.1" dur="10.01">health issue more needs to be done to</text>
  <text start="1933.309" dur="9.031">address mental health in this country</text>
  <text start="1937.11" dur="8.949">more resources need to be directed</text>
  <text start="1942.34" dur="8.49">towards mental health solutions real</text>
  <text start="1946.059" dur="8.361">mental health solutions okay</text>
  <text start="1950.83" dur="6.27">in other news again they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1954.42" dur="5.17">really frame a certain narrative and</text>
  <text start="1957.1" dur="6.81">they will use whatever they can in order</text>
  <text start="1959.59" dur="6.87">to frame this so this guy here who is a</text>
  <text start="1963.91" dur="5.07">former assistant director of</text>
  <text start="1966.46" dur="6.24">counterintelligence in the FBI and also</text>
  <text start="1968.98" dur="6">an NBC contributor had tried to make the</text>
  <text start="1972.7" dur="4.38">argument that President Trump was trying</text>
  <text start="1974.98" dur="5.03">to send some kind of Nazi code so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1977.08" dur="2.93">take a listen to this</text>
  <text start="1981.87" dur="4.35">we have to understand the adversary and</text>
  <text start="1983.97" dur="3.84">the threat we&amp;#39;re dealing with and if we</text>
  <text start="1986.22" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t understand how they think we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1987.81" dur="4.02">never understand how to counter them so</text>
  <text start="1990" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s a little things and language and</text>
  <text start="1991.83" dur="4.53">messaging that matters the president</text>
  <text start="1993.9" dur="8.4">said that we will fly our flags at</text>
  <text start="1996.36" dur="7.95">half-mast until August 8 that&amp;#39;s 8 8 now</text>
  <text start="2002.3" dur="3.96">I&amp;#39;m not going to apply that he did this</text>
  <text start="2004.31" dur="3.57">deliberately but I am using it as an</text>
  <text start="2006.26" dur="3.75">example of the ignorance of the</text>
  <text start="2007.88" dur="4.41">adversary that&amp;#39;s being demonstrated by</text>
  <text start="2010.01" dur="4.47">the White House the numbers 8a are very</text>
  <text start="2012.29" dur="5.55">significant in neo-nazi and white</text>
  <text start="2014.48" dur="5.88">supremacy movement why because the</text>
  <text start="2017.84" dur="4.98">letter H is the eighth letter of the</text>
  <text start="2020.36" dur="5.25">alphabet and to them the numbers B</text>
  <text start="2022.82" dur="4.41">together stand for Heil Hitler</text>
  <text start="2025.61" dur="6.36">so we&amp;#39;re going to be raising the flag</text>
  <text start="2027.23" dur="6.81">back up at dusk on 88 no one&amp;#39;s thinking</text>
  <text start="2031.97" dur="4.41">about this no one no one&amp;#39;s giving him</text>
  <text start="2034.04" dur="9.86">the advice or he&amp;#39;s rejecting the advice</text>
  <text start="2036.38" dur="12.93">oh that is so unbelievable I mean really</text>
  <text start="2043.9" dur="7.69">really dissecting a date trying to dig</text>
  <text start="2049.31" dur="4.38">around for some kind of justification</text>
  <text start="2051.59" dur="6.84">that President Trump is a white</text>
  <text start="2053.69" dur="10.41">nationalist and that somehow he has Nazi</text>
  <text start="2058.43" dur="9.75">ideologies really bizarre how far they</text>
  <text start="2064.1" dur="6.45">have taken this because I&amp;#39;m pretty sure</text>
  <text start="2068.18" dur="5.1">that when President Trump came up with a</text>
  <text start="2070.55" dur="5.37">date of August the 8th he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2073.28" dur="4.95">thinking that oh I&amp;#39;m going to send out</text>
  <text start="2075.92" dur="4.71">some kind of code because really</text>
  <text start="2078.23" dur="4.7">honestly I&amp;#39;ve never even heard of this</text>
  <text start="2080.63" dur="2.3">before</text>
  <text start="2083.29" dur="8.89">this is just crazy they&amp;#39;re really really</text>
  <text start="2089.36" dur="6.75">going to extreme measures to paint this</text>
  <text start="2092.18" dur="7.11">president as racist it&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="2096.11" dur="5.31">okay in other news finally this is the</text>
  <text start="2099.29" dur="4.19">last point I want to make for today this</text>
  <text start="2101.42" dur="7.76">is really good news so a while back</text>
  <text start="2103.48" dur="10.03">President Trump had created a tool that</text>
  <text start="2109.18" dur="7.21">people could use to report censorship</text>
  <text start="2113.51" dur="8.01">because there have there has been a lot</text>
  <text start="2116.39" dur="9.87">of really out cries over the censorship</text>
  <text start="2121.52" dur="6.33">of conservative voices and so president</text>
  <text start="2126.26" dur="5.099">Trump is now taking that a step further</text>
  <text start="2127.85" dur="5.94">and is going to take executive action</text>
  <text start="2131.359" dur="6.211">against big tech for their censorship of</text>
  <text start="2133.79" dur="6.27">conservative voices so this is a big</text>
  <text start="2137.57" dur="4.65">deal now it&amp;#39;s currently in the drafting</text>
  <text start="2140.06" dur="5.7">process and it&amp;#39;s likely going to take a</text>
  <text start="2142.22" dur="5.67">while because he has to be really</text>
  <text start="2145.76" dur="7.83">careful and how this is addressed</text>
  <text start="2147.89" dur="9.35">because it is a free speech issue so it</text>
  <text start="2153.59" dur="6.81">is difficult to discern whether or not</text>
  <text start="2157.24" dur="5.26">Google Facebook Twitter and all of them</text>
  <text start="2160.4" dur="3.39">you have to be able to prove that they</text>
  <text start="2162.5" dur="8.39">are maliciously</text>
  <text start="2163.79" dur="12.84">and purposefully censoring people for a</text>
  <text start="2170.89" dur="10.3">certain viewpoints and then he has to</text>
  <text start="2176.63" dur="8.58">decide exactly what kind of penalties</text>
  <text start="2181.19" dur="6.06">are going to come along with that so</text>
  <text start="2185.21" dur="3.96">this has to be written up very carefully</text>
  <text start="2187.25" dur="4.32">and that is likely why it&amp;#39;s taking a</text>
  <text start="2189.17" dur="4.65">little bit for this to come to fruition</text>
  <text start="2191.57" dur="5.34">but it is in the process of being</text>
  <text start="2193.82" dur="5.91">developed so this is good news and of</text>
  <text start="2196.91" dur="5.22">course I really think that the tool to</text>
  <text start="2199.73" dur="3.93">report censorship was the first step in</text>
  <text start="2202.13" dur="4.2">even creating this executive order</text>
  <text start="2203.66" dur="4.38">because it really creates a database of</text>
  <text start="2206.33" dur="4.13">all of those folks who have been</text>
  <text start="2208.04" dur="5.55">censored and how they&amp;#39;ve been censored</text>
  <text start="2210.46" dur="6.46">so I really recommend if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2213.59" dur="5.64">censored go ahead and report use that</text>
  <text start="2216.92" dur="3.99">tool because that is likely what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2219.23" dur="5.48">using to even create this executive</text>
  <text start="2220.91" dur="8.1">order so that is how you can really take</text>
  <text start="2224.71" dur="6.62">action against censorship</text>
  <text start="2229.01" dur="4.99">alright guys that&amp;#39;s all I have for today</text>
