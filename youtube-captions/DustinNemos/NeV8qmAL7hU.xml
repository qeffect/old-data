  <text start="69.719" dur="4.11">a short word from our sponsors see you</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="4.32">on the other side there was a time when</text>
  <text start="73.829" dur="4.71">I had my head in the sand then I found</text>
  <text start="76.049" dur="5.941">out that powered players passed lies for</text>
  <text start="78.539" dur="5.671">truth and truth for lies especially in</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="5.25">areas of life and hell I used to stay</text>
  <text start="84.21" dur="5.759">quiet and now I speak up a red pill my</text>

  <text start="102.569" dur="6.381">living calm wake up stand up speak up</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="5.161">all right here we go now we talk about</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="5.04">the deep state and we talk about some of</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="4.469">the tools that bad actors like those in</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="4.85">the deep state used to maintain power</text>
  <text start="122.039" dur="5.731">now one of those tools is blackmail</text>
  <text start="125.149" dur="5.441">obviously right people in positions of</text>
  <text start="127.77" dur="5.1">power blackmail each other I feel stupid</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="4.38">just saying that because it&amp;#39;s so obvious</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="5.07">however what people don&amp;#39;t often realize</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="5.58">is that these people have really no</text>
  <text start="137.94" dur="4.92">qualms about doing anything evil at all</text>
  <text start="140.55" dur="4.71">in some cases and that means that</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="4.77">regular old blackmail could suddenly</text>
  <text start="145.26" dur="4.44">become you got caught sleeping with a</text>
  <text start="147.63" dur="4.169">child because you were drugged one night</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="3.81">at a bar and you woke up and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="151.799" dur="3.961">video of you and a kid maybe you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="153.51" dur="3.66">senator maybe you&amp;#39;re a politician well</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="3.66">now they own you</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="4.56">other examples being people that like it</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="4.47">people like Epstein who are used in sort</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="5.339">of honeypot situations to capture other</text>
  <text start="163.89" dur="5.909">people who like it like Bill Clinton or</text>
  <text start="167.069" dur="4.471">Prince Andrew these are people that you</text>
  <text start="169.799" dur="3.931">know seem to be coming back for more</text>
  <text start="171.54" dur="4.949">again and again Bill Clinton alone went</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="3.9">to Epstein&amp;#39;s pedophile Island 26 plus</text>
  <text start="176.489" dur="3.421">times that we know of</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="5.729">often ditching his secret service when</text>
  <text start="179.91" dur="5.669">he was president so there is a world of</text>
  <text start="183.359" dur="3.72">blackmail we don&amp;#39;t even know about and</text>
  <text start="185.579" dur="4.081">it gets pretty dark at the highest</text>
  <text start="187.079" dur="4.081">levels I mean Epstein&amp;#39;s island temple</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="4.079">right there was a temple on that island</text>
  <text start="191.16" dur="5.25">not a gym we already know this</text>
  <text start="193.739" dur="4.53">in fact the fake news called to Jem and</text>
  <text start="196.41" dur="3.54">then it was kind of ridiculous later</text>
  <text start="198.269" dur="4.651">when people went and they sent their</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="4.65">little GoPro zoom cameras and drones and</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="4.319">such in there and we could see that it</text>
  <text start="204.6" dur="4.59">was clearly not a gem in fact it had</text>
  <text start="207.239" dur="4.711">religious markings like the golden dome</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="4.59">it has some sort of middle-eastern</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="3.78">design those blue and white stripes</text>
  <text start="213.78" dur="5.1">which also have some symbolic meaning I</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="5.37">have the owl statue I think the golden</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="3.96">Dolman owls were removed and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="3.99">symbolism all over the island in fact</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="4.739">but what&amp;#39;s most disturbing is in</text>
  <text start="225.09" dur="3.69">Epstein&amp;#39;s Island three stories down at</text>
  <text start="227.579" dur="3.75">least that we know of</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="5.489">there was a dungeon now this is under a</text>
  <text start="231.329" dur="6">temple what kind of people put dungeons</text>
  <text start="234.269" dur="5.101">under temples now also by the way this</text>
  <text start="237.329" dur="4.291">dungeon was filled with children I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="3.959">let you determine what went on down</text>
  <text start="241.62" dur="4.139">there it probably wasn&amp;#39;t just the</text>
  <text start="243.329" dur="3.221">regular sex acts this was probably the</text>
  <text start="245.759" dur="3.651">darkest</text>
  <text start="246.55" dur="5.77">anyway so we have one of Andrea</text>
  <text start="249.41" dur="4.8">Epstein&amp;#39;s X business partners who went</text>
  <text start="252.32" dur="4.56">to jail although Epstein oh there&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="254.21" dur="5.88">dogs because my dog sorry they heard</text>
  <text start="256.88" dur="5.19">something anyway so um one of Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="3.81">former business partners who they both</text>
  <text start="262.07" dur="4.26">maybe committed the crime if sting got</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="5.1">away with it and this guy went down as</text>
  <text start="266.33" dur="5.49">quote admitted to me he was a spy</text>
  <text start="269" dur="5.46">talking about Epstein and it also said</text>
  <text start="271.82" dur="4.44">quote he&amp;#39;s got Prince Andrew pinned to</text>
  <text start="274.46" dur="6.09">the wall end quote</text>
  <text start="276.26" dur="7.32">so just in case Steven Hoffenberg who</text>
  <text start="280.55" dur="5.25">was involved with a particularly bad</text>
  <text start="283.58" dur="4.56">Ponzi scheme before old Bernie Madoff</text>
  <text start="285.8" dur="6">top of the record this may have been the</text>
  <text start="288.14" dur="8.13">record before that in fact he was pretty</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="7.2">much in bed with Epstein and Epstein got</text>
  <text start="296.27" dur="4.98">away with it now I think this is also</text>
  <text start="299" dur="6.27">the book the guy who wrote the book</text>
  <text start="301.25" dur="7.56">Epstein Deadman tell no tales so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.27" dur="5.42">interesting as well and yeah he is I</text>
  <text start="308.81" dur="4.38">guess out of jail now he was the</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="5.26">Epstein&amp;#39;s business partner at the towers</text>
  <text start="313.19" dur="6.24">Financial Group and he even owned one of</text>
  <text start="315.95" dur="5.22">the media outlets at a for a while the</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="4.2">New York Post he was the owner of the</text>
  <text start="321.17" dur="4.59">New York Post so there you go on this</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="4.2">guy kind of fairly high up in the world</text>
  <text start="325.76" dur="4.56">and even I&amp;#39;m surprised even went to jail</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="6.75">at all frankly with the people that he</text>
  <text start="330.32" dur="6.84">knew now we also have dozens indicted by</text>

  <text start="387.27" dur="3">quick death penalties I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="4.08">exactly what he said</text>
  <text start="390.27" dur="4.74">now another lawmaker is demanding a</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="5.07">hearing on the spread of Chinese</text>
  <text start="395.01" dur="7.02">propaganda in Congress representative</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="6.32">jim banks has been kind of alarmed by</text>
  <text start="402.03" dur="5.7">how many of these little chinese funded</text>
  <text start="404.63" dur="5.5">propaganda papers are getting across DC</text>
  <text start="407.73" dur="5.46">and others including china daily</text>
  <text start="410.13" dur="5.64">so they apparently there may have been</text>
  <text start="413.19" dur="4.35">some lies about how much money the</text>
  <text start="415.77" dur="4.38">Chinese government was pumping into</text>
  <text start="417.54" dur="4.95">these little newspapers that are not so</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="4.32">little anymore and now this kind of</text>
  <text start="422.49" dur="4.05">information which you know it&amp;#39;s Chinese</text>
  <text start="424.47" dur="4.29">propaganda so they mix in there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="426.54" dur="4.26">spinning their story and they mix in</text>
  <text start="428.76" dur="5.01">their anti-trump anti America rhetoric</text>
  <text start="430.8" dur="5.85">and you know there are lies damned lies</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="4.32">and statistics so if you&amp;#39;re trusting a</text>
  <text start="436.65" dur="2.97">source it can lie to you in a lot of</text>
  <text start="438.09" dur="3.78">different ways if you&amp;#39;re not very</text>
  <text start="439.62" dur="4.68">careful about it so we have to be really</text>
  <text start="441.87" dur="5.37">careful of someone like China clearly</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="4.41">has an agenda pumping us information I</text>
  <text start="447.24" dur="5.1">mean it&amp;#39;s no better than the fake news</text>
  <text start="448.71" dur="5.49">in fact so continuing on here not a big</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="6.06">surprise and hopefully they&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="454.2" dur="5.49">somewhere with it we also have alarms</text>
  <text start="458.4" dur="4.59">being sounded over the Chinese</text>
  <text start="459.69" dur="6.72">repression of Catholics so a year after</text>
  <text start="462.99" dur="6.36">the Vatican the anti-catholic Pope that</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="5.13">he is made a deal with the communist</text>
  <text start="469.35" dur="4.53">that pretty much allowed them to pick</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="4.05">their own bishop which is wrong and then</text>
  <text start="473.88" dur="3.54">that Bishop was later quoted as saying</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="3.96">that you have camera the exact quote but</text>
  <text start="477.42" dur="4.08">something along the lines of you have to</text>
  <text start="479.55" dur="4.29">put your part your party and your people</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="4.89">before your religion so that the old</text>
  <text start="483.84" dur="6.06">communists you know idea that nothing</text>
  <text start="486.39" dur="4.77">nothing comes before your government not</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="3.03">even God</text>
  <text start="491.16" dur="3.96">and that&amp;#39;s why communism has always</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="4.83">hated God or Christianity or any</text>
  <text start="495.12" dur="5.91">religion because it&amp;#39;s a threat they want</text>
  <text start="497.76" dur="6.51">to be your God so therefore they are</text>
  <text start="501.03" dur="5.16">very jealous of any others so you know</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="3.66">in it of course communism doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="5.13">if there&amp;#39;s a higher authority to go to</text>
  <text start="507.93" dur="5.01">for morals than a party because of all</text>
  <text start="511.32" dur="2.26">of the constant atrocities and</text>
  <text start="512.94" dur="2.62">violations</text>
  <text start="513.58" dur="4.53">of basic morality and common sense that</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="4.34">have to be done for a communist Society</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="5.34">to work for a short period of time</text>
  <text start="519.9" dur="7.54">anyway so you know in China</text>
  <text start="523.45" dur="8.19">basically they run the religion the Pope</text>
  <text start="527.44" dur="6.15">it himself has sold out Catholicism in</text>
  <text start="531.64" dur="4.89">this way and you know he continues to do</text>
  <text start="533.59" dur="6.42">so with other comments I mean one of the</text>
  <text start="536.53" dur="5.7">Italian national soccer team manager and</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="3.87">I think he was like a celebrity soccer</text>
  <text start="542.23" dur="3.69">player himself for a while but now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.88" dur="5.6">a team manager for the national team he</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="6.72">told him and Pope Francis told this guy</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="4.48">not to make the sign of the Cross on the</text>
  <text start="552.64" dur="2.79">fields you know how Catholics will do</text>
  <text start="553.96" dur="3.66">the thing where they they cross</text>
  <text start="555.43" dur="6.3">themselves and it&amp;#39;s like a religious</text>
  <text start="557.62" dur="5.76">thing well he told him that he didn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="561.73" dur="3.36">said don&amp;#39;t you have other thoughts in</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="3.69">this moment which is the Pope saying why</text>
  <text start="565.09" dur="4.05">are you why are you crossing right now</text>
  <text start="567.07" dur="4.53">it makes you feel like an idiot and then</text>
  <text start="569.14" dur="3.9">of course it&amp;#39;s the Pope so if you anger</text>
  <text start="571.6" dur="4.47">him that couldn&amp;#39;t ruin your life and</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="6.15">especially in Catholic countries so the</text>
  <text start="576.07" dur="4.8">idea that the the Pope tells people to</text>
  <text start="579.19" dur="3.84">not convert people he said he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="580.87" dur="4.47">that recently he tells people not to</text>
  <text start="583.03" dur="5.94">make the cross the sign of the Cross</text>
  <text start="585.34" dur="6.06">he tells people you know weird things</text>
  <text start="588.97" dur="4.8">about the origins of Christ he tells</text>
  <text start="591.4" dur="4.41">people you know just things that you</text>
  <text start="593.77" dur="3.33">would not expect a Pope to say I mean</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s almost as though next he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="597.1" dur="3.84">come out pearl abortion if he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="599.32" dur="3.12">already I mean maybe he has I think</text>
  <text start="600.94" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s like the one thing that he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="602.44" dur="5.4">yet but I don&amp;#39;t know so we also have as</text>

  <text start="771.6" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re not gay if you rape kids</text>
  <text start="774.18" dur="4.38">you&amp;#39;re a gay pedophile maybe but you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="797.93" dur="3.9">other Hollywood types that you have</text>
  <text start="799.49" dur="5.15">questions about and also Marina</text>
  <text start="801.83" dur="6.99">Abramovic we know others have been</text>
  <text start="804.64" dur="6.55">pictured with him like oh what&amp;#39;s her</text>
  <text start="808.82" dur="3.6">name Chrissy Teigen and John Legend I</text>
  <text start="811.19" dur="1.71">think they&amp;#39;ve been pictured with him as</text>
  <text start="812.42" dur="2.07">well</text>
  <text start="812.9" dur="3.39">I reported on that when I broke down</text>
  <text start="814.49" dur="4.5">Chrissy Teigen and John Legend&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="816.29" dur="4.08">you know he&amp;#39;s a famous pop singer you</text>
  <text start="818.99" dur="3.51">would hear his music on the radio all</text>
  <text start="820.37" dur="3.96">the time but they&amp;#39;ve got some pretty</text>
  <text start="822.5" dur="4.47">mysterious pictures with their own child</text>
  <text start="824.33" dur="5.94">and and some very heavy innuendo and</text>
  <text start="826.97" dur="5.7">symbolism as well so these birds of a</text>
  <text start="830.27" dur="4.74">feather flock together kind of thing and</text>
  <text start="832.67" dur="6.6">I don&amp;#39;t know if he&amp;#39;s killing off his</text>
  <text start="835.01" dur="6.93">victims or if he is just lucky in this</text>
  <text start="839.27" dur="5.13">sense that his victims are dying left</text>
  <text start="841.94" dur="3.78">and right of their own volition right I</text>
  <text start="844.4" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t buy it</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="5.01">so we also have CNN hosts appearing and</text>
  <text start="848.81" dur="4.35">devastated over the new poll showing</text>
  <text start="850.73" dur="4.32">Trump&amp;#39;s surge after impeachment it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="853.16" dur="7.41">only helping him let&amp;#39;s show you guys</text>
  <text start="855.05" dur="7.11">what I&amp;#39;m talking about here this massive</text>
  <text start="860.57" dur="3.48">movement towards the President of the</text>
  <text start="862.16" dur="3.57">United States at least in our poll at</text>
  <text start="864.05" dur="4.62">this particular point we have any sense</text>
  <text start="865.73" dur="4.83">of why yeah okay so III think that there</text>
  <text start="868.67" dur="3.72">are a couple of key reasons why that is</text>
  <text start="870.56" dur="3.93">so take a look at how economic</text>
  <text start="872.39" dur="3.78">conditions are in the country today and</text>
  <text start="874.49" dur="4.17">what we see we can have all like going</text>
  <text start="876.17" dur="4.38">back to 2000 and look at this most of</text>
  <text start="878.66" dur="2.97">the time over the last decade we&amp;#39;ve most</text>
  <text start="880.55" dur="3.81">people said we have poor economic</text>
  <text start="881.63" dur="4.17">conditions but take a look now now most</text>
  <text start="884.36" dur="4.38">people say the in fact we have good</text>
  <text start="885.8" dur="4.35">economic conditions 76% of the country</text>
  <text start="888.74" dur="5.16">say we have good economic conditions</text>
  <text start="890.15" dur="5.49">just 22% say we have poor that is in</text>
  <text start="893.9" dur="3.51">fact the best numbers that we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="895.64" dur="4.23">since the beginning of not just this</text>
  <text start="897.41" dur="3.66">past decade but the last decade you</text>
  <text start="899.87" dur="2.82">actually and on the debate stage last</text>
  <text start="901.07" dur="4.44">night the Democrats were asked about</text>
  <text start="902.69" dur="3.96">that and they said even if 76% of</text>
  <text start="905.51" dur="3.03">Americans say it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="906.65" dur="3.15">maybe Americans don&amp;#39;t see it like that</text>
  <text start="908.54" dur="3.18">they have a tough sell on that yeah I</text>
  <text start="909.8" dur="4.26">think they absolutely have a tough sell</text>
  <text start="911.72" dur="4.62">on that and that is definitely also the</text>
  <text start="914.06" dur="4.11">the numbers in favor of Donald Trump so</text>
  <text start="916.34" dur="4.74">take a look at his favorability ratings</text>
  <text start="918.17" dur="6.18">now his favorable rating 46 percent</text>
  <text start="921.08" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s up from 44% in October and 43</text>
  <text start="924.35" dur="3.54">percent in June and the net favorables</text>
  <text start="926.42" dur="4.23">that your favorable minus your</text>
  <text start="927.89" dur="4.98">unfavorable that&amp;#39;s up to six right minus</text>
  <text start="930.65" dur="4.11">six right now that that deficit has been</text>
  <text start="932.87" dur="3.96">cut in half so the president is becoming</text>
  <text start="934.76" dur="3.51">more popular in part I believe because</text>
  <text start="936.83" dur="3.57">of the strong what people view as a</text>
  <text start="938.27" dur="3.57">strong economy and if the president can</text>
  <text start="940.4" dur="4.44">convince people on it sounds like he has</text>
  <text start="941.84" dur="4.83">that only he can steward this economy</text>
  <text start="944.84" dur="4.29">that it wouldn&amp;#39;t just be on automatic</text>
  <text start="946.67" dur="4.32">pilot that that only he has this might</text>
  <text start="949.13" dur="3.48">as such that could definitely be the</text>
  <text start="950.99" dur="2.94">case and you know that might be in fact</text>
  <text start="952.61" dur="2.73">part of the reason why some of the</text>
  <text start="953.93" dur="3.51">Democrats you know we spoke about this</text>
  <text start="955.34" dur="4.26">yesterday are becoming less popular so</text>
  <text start="957.44" dur="3.96">back in October Sanders and Biden had</text>
  <text start="959.6" dur="4.26">net positive favorability ratings</text>
  <text start="961.4" dur="4.14">Sanders at plus-2 by net plus two even</text>
  <text start="963.86" dur="3.21">Warren was just at minus three and now</text>
  <text start="965.54" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re all negative except for Buddha</text>
  <text start="967.07" dur="3.54">judge who&amp;#39;s basically dead even so I</text>
  <text start="968.81" dur="3.66">think you have this combination of Trump</text>
  <text start="970.61" dur="3.39">becoming a little bit more popular and</text>
  <text start="972.47" dur="3.03">the Democrats becoming a little less</text>
  <text start="974" dur="7.26">popular and that&amp;#39;s why the numbers are</text>
  <text start="975.5" dur="7.53">moving in his direction hello I think</text>
  <text start="981.26" dur="3.99">you have a combination of Trump becoming</text>
  <text start="983.03" dur="4.08">a little more popular and some of the</text>
  <text start="985.25" dur="4.01">Democrats becoming a little less popular</text>
  <text start="987.11" dur="4.47">I think I can agree with you there</text>
  <text start="989.26" dur="6.04">finally something CNN said that makes</text>
  <text start="991.58" dur="5.46">sense all right continuing on California</text>

  <text start="1014.14" dur="4.65">him it it&amp;#39;s deeply disappointing that</text>
  <text start="1017.38" dur="4.2">the governor is choosing to work with</text>

  <text start="1044.16" dur="6.21">there but anyway so continuing on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1048.39" dur="4.23">just one of many many many people who</text>
  <text start="1050.37" dur="4.17">are murderers or rapists or worse you</text>
