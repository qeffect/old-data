  <text start="83.46" dur="3.51">money I make on here which is not much</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m a minimalist and I don&amp;#39;t need a lot</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="4.5">of money I don&amp;#39;t ask for a lot</text>
  <text start="88.71" dur="4.83">I don&amp;#39;t monetize my videos you know I</text>

  <text start="93.54" dur="3.36">selling t-shirts or anything like that</text>
  <text start="95.07" dur="4.11">to help fund what I&amp;#39;m doing here I just</text>
  <text start="96.9" dur="4.59">focus on spreading content getting the</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="4.259">truth out there q and on Magha</text>
  <text start="101.49" dur="6.15">culture history everything I talked</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="7.021">about it all I am now being shut down</text>
  <text start="107.64" dur="4.08">across the board it&amp;#39;s probably only a</text>
  <text start="110.46" dur="3.33">matter of time until Twitter and</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="3.539">Facebook get me as well so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="3.39">talk a little bit about what we can do</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="4.68">here okay</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="4.32">what what can we do to counter all of</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="3.21">these big guys coming at us right</text>
  <text start="121.5" dur="3.24">because where else are we gonna go what</text>
  <text start="123.149" dur="4.411">else can we do because they own it all</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="4.92">right well not anymore folks nowadays</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="3.87">there are options that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="129.66" dur="4.079">control and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="2.46">of the most okay so if you want to send</text>
  <text start="133.739" dur="1.501">me</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="3.3">funds and you want to support what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="135.24" dur="4.5">doing so that I can make my bills meet</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="4.59">my ends meet and pay my bills while</text>
  <text start="139.74" dur="3.93">spreading this content and doing this</text>
  <text start="141.78" dur="3.9">work for you guys then you can go to</text>
  <text start="143.67" dur="3.57">cryptocurrency now I know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="2.82">there&amp;#39;s mixed feelings about it some</text>
  <text start="147.24" dur="3.9">people think it&amp;#39;s the worst idea ever</text>
  <text start="148.5" dur="5.25">however even if you disagree with it</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="4.65">even if you don&amp;#39;t think it will destroy</text>
  <text start="153.75" dur="5.28">the the banksters like I do even if you</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="4.8">think that it&amp;#39;s not a good currency you</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="4.37">can still send it to me digitally online</text>
  <text start="160.59" dur="5.73">and I can still pay my bills okay so</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="4.54">this is a way to get around GoFundMe &amp;amp;</text>
  <text start="166.32" dur="4.169">patreon and PayPal and all the other</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="5.19">things that are gonna ban us these are</text>
  <text start="170.489" dur="4.111">the gatekeepers of knowledge folks the</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="4.41">youtubes and the Twitter&amp;#39;s and the</text>
  <text start="174.6" dur="4.71">Facebook&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re gonna try to censor</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="3.96">us and keep us from spreading truth and</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="3.78">when they fail then they&amp;#39;re going to try</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="3.84">to go after our money what does that</text>
  <text start="183.09" dur="4.59">mean the patreon accounts the go fund me</text>
  <text start="185.34" dur="5.61">accounts and the PayPal accounts all</text>
  <text start="187.68" dur="4.589">right what can we do well I&amp;#39;m gonna show</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="4.19">you guys a little bit of what you can do</text>
  <text start="192.269" dur="6.481">I&amp;#39;m gonna give you some ideas one is</text>
  <text start="195.14" dur="5.53">local bitcoins calm now you can go to</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.62">coinbase there are other services but</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="6.18">this is my favorite it&amp;#39;s simple it has a</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="6.3">review system it&amp;#39;s kind of a kind of a</text>
  <text start="206.85" dur="4.889">exchange system with its own escrow</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="4.289">service you can go and you can look at</text>
  <text start="211.739" dur="4.5">people&amp;#39;s reviews their ratings how many</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="4.59">transactions they&amp;#39;ve done what form of</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="3.78">cash that they take what form of payment</text>
  <text start="218.549" dur="3.181">they&amp;#39;re willing to take what price</text>
  <text start="220.019" dur="3.391">they&amp;#39;re charging that day for Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="5.22">you can compare that to the daily</text>
  <text start="223.41" dur="4.74">average Bitcoin price just like you</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="3.21">would with gold and silver you&amp;#39;ll look</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="3.63">at the spot price for the day you can</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="3.69">see what their limits are you can get</text>
  <text start="231.78" dur="3.299">help there in my experience I&amp;#39;ve only</text>
  <text start="233.85" dur="3.389">worked with people that had good reviews</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="4.771">but it&amp;#39;s been very pleasant experience</text>
  <text start="237.239" dur="4.411">it&amp;#39;s been great now you can do you can</text>
  <text start="239.85" dur="3.99">use coinbase it&amp;#39;s a little slower and</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="3.869">there&amp;#39;s a lot of regulations there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="3.84">lot of rules they ban people all the</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="4.081">time for no reason I would probably only</text>
  <text start="247.68" dur="5.85">use coinbase as a way to sell my</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="5.55">bitcoins to be honest but that&amp;#39;s just me</text>
  <text start="253.53" dur="3.66">and that&amp;#39;s advice that I&amp;#39;ve taken from</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="5.85">experts in the field I&amp;#39;m not an expert</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="6.69">in crypto currencies you know now what</text>
  <text start="261" dur="4.5">else can we do well that well first of</text>
  <text start="263.88" dur="3.84">all before we move on they can&amp;#39;t control</text>
  <text start="265.5" dur="5.34">you sending money this way</text>
  <text start="267.72" dur="5.01">like Obama fearfully said you could have</text>
  <text start="270.84" dur="5.1">your own Swiss bank account in your</text>
  <text start="272.73" dur="5.61">pocket and no one can stop you right now</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="4.55">he was saying it in a negative way but I</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="4.59">think that&amp;#39;s a wonderful wonderful thing</text>
  <text start="280.49" dur="3.52">but that&amp;#39;s just my opinion even if you</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t believe in it this is a way to</text>
  <text start="284.01" dur="5.79">support the channel so I highly</text>
  <text start="287.22" dur="4.5">encourage everyone to ask or to learn</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="4.38">this because and ask for help if you</text>
  <text start="291.72" dur="5.73">need it because this is this is the next</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="6.75">step folks if we excuse me if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="5.64">serious about countering the censorship</text>
  <text start="300.93" dur="7.11">and fighting back against the big tech</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="7.26">giants we have to destroy excuse me so I</text>
  <text start="308.04" dur="6.18">can&amp;#39;t talk today we have to destroy them</text>
  <text start="310.35" dur="6.03">we have to move against them and we have</text>
  <text start="314.22" dur="4.14">to take away their viewership we have to</text>
  <text start="316.38" dur="4.83">take away their their their monetization</text>
  <text start="318.36" dur="4.47">their we have to withdraw our support in</text>
  <text start="321.21" dur="3.84">every way possible that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="322.83" dur="4.86">just deal with it while they continue to</text>
  <text start="325.05" dur="4.56">shadow ban us and still use their just</text>
  <text start="327.69" dur="3.66">their platforms that means we start</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="3.6">using their platforms and other</text>
  <text start="331.35" dur="3.81">platforms that are open to free speech</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="4.14">like gabay i which is better than</text>
  <text start="335.16" dur="5.82">twitter and facebook and has promised to</text>
  <text start="337.35" dur="5.64">maintain freedom of speech or like d</text>
  <text start="340.98" dur="3.41">tube or bitch shoot where we can go post</text>
  <text start="342.99" dur="5.28">videos and they can&amp;#39;t take them down</text>
  <text start="344.39" dur="6.66">okay so yes there are better options all</text>
  <text start="348.27" dur="6.959">right so this is this is how you can</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="6.73">fund me if you want now how do you want</text>
  <text start="355.229" dur="5.641">to store your bitcoins well I like to</text>
  <text start="357.78" dur="4.56">use the Exodus wallet it&amp;#39;s a pretty good</text>
  <text start="360.87" dur="3.06">overall wallet it holds a lot of</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="3.75">different types of coins and I&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="4.02">any of them I don&amp;#39;t care it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.09" dur="3.78">fairly simple to use I would recommend</text>
  <text start="367.95" dur="6.06">sticking to some of the big ones like</text>
  <text start="369.87" dur="5.22">mineiro litecoin bitcoin cash is</text>
  <text start="374.01" dur="3.06">probably a little bit better than</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="3.93">Bitcoin cause bitcoins kind of expensive</text>
  <text start="377.07" dur="5.43">and slow right now to send you know</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="6.06">there&amp;#39;s a fee when you send money so</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="4.29">there are those things that you can do I</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="4.29">would avoid ripple because that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="386.79" dur="4.95">bankster coin it is not decentralized</text>
  <text start="389.37" dur="4.53">but my favorites probably Manero or</text>
  <text start="391.74" dur="3.9">aetherium and they both have a lot of</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="3.84">things going for them own arrow is very</text>
  <text start="395.64" dur="4.62">very private and aetherium has a lot of</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="3.66">good technology and has a lot of things</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="3.18">besides the crip</text>
  <text start="401.4" dur="4.89">no currency money aspect it also is used</text>
  <text start="403.44" dur="4.71">for smart contracts and other things a</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="3.42">lot of business stuff that it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="408.15" dur="3.45">really change the world it already is</text>
  <text start="409.71" dur="3.5">okay if theorem could potentially</text>
  <text start="411.6" dur="4.439">overtake bitcoin this year I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="7.09">but you can go and you can get your</text>
  <text start="416.039" dur="10.231">Exodus multi currency crypto wallet from</text>
  <text start="420.3" dur="7.23">exodus dot IO it has a lot of like I</text>

  <text start="427.53" dur="5.25">kinds of crypto currencies and you know</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="3.51">if you can do it all from right here</text>

  <text start="441.84" dur="4.049">have your address and you know one thing</text>
  <text start="444.03" dur="3.449">that&amp;#39;s worth mentioning you cannot you</text>
  <text start="445.889" dur="3.271">can&amp;#39;t recover lost money there&amp;#39;s no one</text>

  <text start="457.68" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re sitting to an address it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="4.41">be a long digit a long string of digits</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="3.929">kind of like this here this transaction</text>
  <text start="463.38" dur="3.99">ID it&amp;#39;s a really long string of random</text>
  <text start="465.539" dur="4.35">numbers and digits that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="467.37" dur="4.71">be when you send and receive okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.889" dur="4.71">not to your name it&amp;#39;s to your your</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="4.86">address and if you send it to the wrong</text>
  <text start="474.599" dur="4.5">address or you miss a single digit that</text>
  <text start="476.94" dur="4.5">money is gone forever all right now</text>
  <text start="479.099" dur="4.411">don&amp;#39;t be scared it&amp;#39;s pretty simple it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="3.36">easy to do and most of them have a</text>
  <text start="483.51" dur="2.969">little button you can just click and it</text>
  <text start="484.8" dur="3.179">copies it for you and you can paste it</text>
  <text start="486.479" dur="3.631">so you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about typing</text>
  <text start="487.979" dur="4.261">it wrong but it&amp;#39;s important to know</text>
