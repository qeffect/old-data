  <text start="109.16" dur="4.05">morality and such and that seems to be</text>
  <text start="111.5" dur="4.5">part of his branding at least but</text>
  <text start="113.21" dur="4.83">certainly not a moral man he&amp;#39;s lying</text>
  <text start="116" dur="5.04">scumbag traitor traitor and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.04" dur="5.79">committed treasonous acts now it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="143.1" dur="4.32">Mueller provides false and or misleading</text>
  <text start="145.23" dur="8.7">testimony will a G bar be forced to</text>
  <text start="147.42" dur="7.74">declare nosov the truth that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="153.93" dur="3.51">Mueller had to back down I mean they</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="3.93">they had nothing because this AG would D</text>
  <text start="157.44" dur="3.45">class and then they would be exposed in</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="3.87">a big lie so they can&amp;#39;t just lie because</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="5.49">they know he&amp;#39;ll do it so that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="162.96" dur="7.58">Miller walked away that&amp;#39;s why a big</text>
  <text start="166.38" dur="4.16">nothing burger as the saying goes</text>
  <text start="170.84" dur="3.91">continuing on if Mueller defers to the</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="4.92">original report</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="5.58">but Democrats push fake news and use</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="4.14">fake news to push a false narrative</text>
  <text start="180.33" dur="6.21">knowing majority of the public did not</text>
  <text start="182.76" dur="7.31">watch the actual hearing did AG bar a</text>
  <text start="186.54" dur="5.91">will AG be bar be forced to D class all</text>
  <text start="190.07" dur="6.52">documentation to ensure public awareness</text>
  <text start="192.45" dur="6.15">of the truth well he might is this what</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="3.48">I love about the Socratic method asking</text>
  <text start="198.6" dur="5.31">the question makes you think and then</text>
  <text start="200.07" dur="5.04">logic says well yes that is exactly what</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="4.67">would probably happen in that situation</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="6.56">it makes sense now Q says be ready</text>
  <text start="208.58" dur="7.96">Mueller be ready</text>
  <text start="211.67" dur="9.55">James call me and be ready traitors one</text>

  <text start="228.54" dur="5.1">grandmother&amp;#39;s ever spoken to this is</text>
  <text start="231.81" dur="3.929">exactly what we are using on them now</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="4.41">and they hire him serious trouble it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="6.271">hard to keep your secrets and and keep</text>
  <text start="238.05" dur="5.79">up the charade of this this this big lie</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="3.33">that they&amp;#39;re all trying to run with it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.84" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s falling apart because you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.34" dur="3.27">keep up a big lie especially if you</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="3.57">can&amp;#39;t have your little secret you know</text>
  <text start="248.61" dur="3.72">club meetings and stuff without having</text>

  <text start="261.019" dur="4.471">brennon clapper and and maybe even</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="3.599">McCabe&amp;#39;s in there kind of taking notes</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="4.049">and then doing what he&amp;#39;s told getting</text>

  <text start="279.62" dur="2.28">all their technology and all their</text>
  <text start="280.699" dur="3.171">phones are in the other room because</text>
  <text start="281.9" dur="7.41">that&amp;#39;s exactly what you&amp;#39;d have to do to</text>
  <text start="283.87" dur="8.169">to keep cue from from finding you at</text>
  <text start="289.31" dur="5.699">this point if cue wants to so q has the</text>
  <text start="292.039" dur="5.461">NSA q has FISA at this point and by Q of</text>
  <text start="295.009" dur="5.011">course I mean POTUS and good guys and</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="4.28">and the good team in this case I doubt Q</text>
  <text start="300.02" dur="6.06">is directly handling the legalese here</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="7.41">but we also have three four five nine so</text>

  <text start="320.539" dur="3.18">he tried to kill someone else it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="322.31" dur="4.889">of a mob thing and then they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="323.719" dur="5.401">to link him to being a Q or Trump</text>
  <text start="327.199" dur="4.201">superfan or something like that just</text>

  <text start="363.229" dur="5.25">of this movement</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="6.54">ask yourself a very simple question why</text>
  <text start="368.479" dur="5.951">why are the biggest media companies in</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="4.74">the world that that doc doc doc and him</text>
  <text start="374.43" dur="3.48">of course he&amp;#39;s implying the same</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="4.14">question he&amp;#39;s been asking all this time</text>
  <text start="377.91" dur="4.05">why are the biggest media companies in</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="3.93">the world attacking the qyn on movement</text>
  <text start="381.96" dur="3.87">as though it was the greatest threat in</text>
  <text start="384.12" dur="4.74">the room next to trump himself and</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="4.709">obviously they attack Trump more but why</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="3.66">are they attacking cue more than</text>
  <text start="390.539" dur="3.151">anything else other than Trump in the</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="2.63">world why are they spending so much time</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="5.699">and money and resources</text>
  <text start="395.15" dur="7.75">attacking cue well because it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="5.731">biggest threat now we also have and</text>
  <text start="402.9" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s logic of course accuse pointing</text>
  <text start="405.12" dur="3.299">this out many times but that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="406.77" dur="3.42">beauty of the Socratic method is you</text>
  <text start="408.419" dur="2.4">just ask the questions and people find</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="4.89">it themselves</text>
  <text start="410.819" dur="6.241">now 3460 be ready Neil we&amp;#39;re hearing on</text>
