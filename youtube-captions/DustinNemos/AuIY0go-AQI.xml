  <text start="12.03" dur="5.4">James commis FBI under the Carter page</text>
  <text start="14.88" dur="5.37">Faisal occation even calling into</text>
  <text start="17.43" dur="6.06">account other vice applications now and</text>
  <text start="20.25" dur="5.55">the entire FBI protocol so all of this</text>
  <text start="23.49" dur="5.81">and the FBI response right after a short</text>
  <text start="25.8" dur="3.5">word from our Patriot sponsors</text>
  <text start="30.44" dur="4.71">there was a time when I had my head in</text>
  <text start="32.48" dur="5.37">the sand then I found out that powered</text>
  <text start="35.15" dur="5.49">platers past lies for truth and truth</text>
  <text start="37.85" dur="5.52">for lies especially in areas of life and</text>
  <text start="40.64" dur="5.88">hell I used to stay quiet and now I</text>

  <text start="60.17" dur="9.6">pill living calm wake up stand up speak</text>
  <text start="64.489" dur="7.351">up so here we go going through the news</text>
  <text start="69.77" dur="5.16">in stunning public reviewed fights of</text>
  <text start="71.84" dur="6.569">court slams FBI says worried about other</text>
  <text start="74.93" dur="7.08">warrants so of course as I said the head</text>
  <text start="78.409" dur="5.671">FISA judge judge Collier responding to</text>
  <text start="82.01" dur="3.98">the IG report and some of the</text>
  <text start="84.08" dur="5.07">interesting quotes that came out of this</text>
  <text start="85.99" dur="6.55">was antithetical to the heightened duty</text>
  <text start="89.15" dur="5.67">of candor so the FBI&amp;#39;s handling of the</text>
  <text start="92.54" dur="4.56">Carter page applications as portrayed in</text>
  <text start="94.82" dur="4.29">the OIG report was antithetical to the</text>
  <text start="97.1" dur="4.68">heightened duty of candor or you know</text>
  <text start="99.11" dur="5.34">candor being honest and also a little</text>
  <text start="101.78" dur="4.98">further on quote the frequency with</text>
  <text start="104.45" dur="4.68">which it representations made by FBI</text>
  <text start="106.76" dur="4.5">personnel turned out to be unsupported</text>
  <text start="109.13" dur="5.04">or contradicted by information in their</text>
  <text start="111.26" dur="5.76">possession and with which they withheld</text>
  <text start="114.17" dur="5.34">information detrimental to their case</text>
  <text start="117.02" dur="5.72">calls into question whether information</text>
  <text start="119.51" dur="6.84">contained in other FBI applications is</text>
  <text start="122.74" dur="5.23">reliable this is from the court so this</text>
  <text start="126.35" dur="3.6">is insane</text>
  <text start="127.97" dur="4.379">this proves that they&amp;#39;re willfully be I</text>
  <text start="129.95" dur="4.98">mean that that seems to be supportive of</text>
  <text start="132.349" dur="6.091">the word willful they had things in</text>
  <text start="134.93" dur="5.43">their possession information in their</text>
  <text start="138.44" dur="3.81">possession which contradicted their very</text>
  <text start="140.36" dur="3.75">claims coming out of their mouths to the</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="4.95">or on their papers through their pens</text>
  <text start="144.11" dur="5.58">either way to the FISA Court judges they</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="3.959">were said saying things with one thing</text>
  <text start="149.69" dur="3.99">and then they knew it to be another way</text>
  <text start="151.159" dur="4.47">and they had evidence to even prove it</text>
  <text start="153.68" dur="4.559">and they were just not sharing that with</text>
  <text start="155.629" dur="6.421">the FISA Court so this is incredibly</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="5.711">damning but that&amp;#39;s not all we also have</text>
  <text start="162.05" dur="4.6">the IG Horowitz hearing</text>
  <text start="163.95" dur="5.16">the deliberate FBI misconduct as well</text>
  <text start="166.65" dur="5.13">when they went after the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="169.11" dur="4.709">so we&amp;#39;ve seen that play out and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="5.1">hard to believe that the FBI was abusing</text>
  <text start="173.819" dur="6.321">the FISA Court now we also have the FBI</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="6.63">under director Ray issuing a response</text>
  <text start="180.14" dur="5.17">not much of a response but basically</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="2.28">saying that they will change a couple of</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="3.42">things</text>
  <text start="185.79" dur="5.729">about 40 different new corrective steps</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="5.039">so see the FBI immediately responded to</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="4.08">the FISA rebuke and claimed director ray</text>
  <text start="193.769" dur="4.381">quote has ordered more than forty</text>
  <text start="195.599" dur="4.981">corrective steps to address the report&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="198.15" dur="4.29">recommendations including some</text>
  <text start="200.58" dur="5.58">improvements beyond those recommended by</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="6.51">the IG so that&amp;#39;s kind of where we are</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="5.549">and now and I want to add in one last</text>
  <text start="208.95" dur="4.98">little clip before we head out just to</text>
  <text start="211.709" dur="5.491">kind of bring the point to its summary</text>
  <text start="213.93" dur="4.08">this it seems to be a collusion between</text>
  <text start="217.2" dur="4.08">the FBI</text>
  <text start="218.01" dur="5.22">the DNC possibly the Clinton party and</text>
  <text start="221.28" dur="4.44">others and they were trying to take down</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="5.49">a legitimately elected president using</text>
  <text start="225.72" dur="5.19">bogus made-up crimes in broad daylight</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="4.2">in front of the American people that</text>
  <text start="230.91" dur="3.87">seems to be what&amp;#39;s happening so with</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="5.34">that said I want to show you this</text>
  <text start="234.78" dur="5.82">particular video here we go I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="4.44">constitutional attorney I&amp;#39;m a pastor and</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="3.419">an attorney from North Georgia but I</text>
  <text start="242.7" dur="3">believe that you take another to look at</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="3.211">this and you can apply constitutional</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="3.75">lenses we all set through those classes</text>
  <text start="247.23" dur="4.379">but it&amp;#39;s a common-sense lens it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="249.45" dur="4.11">common-sense lens mr. Cole made a</text>
  <text start="251.609" dur="4.56">question a comment there when he in his</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="4.649">opening statements he says you said mr.</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="4.981">Cole has said it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense yeah</text>
  <text start="258.209" dur="5.431">it does it makes perfect sense look at</text>
  <text start="261.15" dur="4.95">the pattern you know the only thing that</text>
  <text start="263.64" dur="6.02">is that is a clear and present danger</text>
  <text start="266.1" dur="8.91">right now in this room is the pattern of</text>
  <text start="269.66" dur="7.54">attack and abuse of rules and decisions</text>
  <text start="275.01" dur="3.96">to get at this president they started</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="4.26">over three years ago really the night he</text>
  <text start="278.97" dur="3.81">was elected and and I said the other day</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="3.179">and the committee hearing I thought</text>
  <text start="282.78" dur="3">about you know that having the means and</text>
  <text start="284.639" dur="3.871">the motive and the opportunity the</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="5.58">opportunity for this day occurred last</text>
  <text start="288.51" dur="4.68">November when we lost majority it</text>
  <text start="291.36" dur="5.04">occurred because they&amp;#39;d already talked</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="4.47">about it for years in prior and so now</text>
  <text start="296.4" dur="2.49">we just bring it forward</text>
