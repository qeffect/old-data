  <text start="40.949" dur="4.561">cost okay these are the kind of the home</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="3.39">pharmacy that the holistic stuff that</text>
  <text start="45.51" dur="3.81">you can often make yourself at home</text>
  <text start="46.92" dur="5.12">I&amp;#39;ve done some of the videos on that but</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="5.61">and you&amp;#39;ll have to ignore some of my</text>
  <text start="52.04" dur="6.1">some of my bottles are reused because I</text>
  <text start="54.93" dur="7.08">like to recycle glass bottles one thing</text>
  <text start="58.14" dur="6.36">that I do do some anyway some one thing</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="4.62">that I do sometimes is caffeine I try</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="4.26">not to it causes problems adrenal</text>
  <text start="66.63" dur="6.39">fatigue and stuff but you sure get a lot</text>
  <text start="68.76" dur="5.49">done and I prefer rather than taking the</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="3.75">time to make coffee I&amp;#39;m pretty lazy</text>
  <text start="74.25" dur="4.2">about it I take green tea caffeine</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="4.34">powder it&amp;#39;s 15 percent or 50 percent</text>
  <text start="78.45" dur="4.769">caffeine and it&amp;#39;s quite dangerous</text>
  <text start="81.11" dur="3.759">especially for like kids to get ahold</text>
  <text start="83.219" dur="6.061">over something this could kill you if</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="6.481">you take too much I don&amp;#39;t even like 1/4</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="6.119">spoon is a cup of coffee basically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="7.379">not even it&amp;#39;s pretty intense um I of</text>
  <text start="95.399" dur="6.57">course apple cider vinegar Matt everyday</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="5.401">the more of that swirly stuff in the</text>
  <text start="101.969" dur="4.591">bottom the better that&amp;#39;s the mother you</text>
  <text start="104.13" dur="4.199">want that that&amp;#39;s the health stuff a lot</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="4.169">of science still can&amp;#39;t quite figure out</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="6.36">why it&amp;#39;s so good for you</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="6.93">not tequila it&amp;#39;s actually boron and</text>
  <text start="114.689" dur="3.961">borax so I&amp;#39;m actually gonna put some of</text>
  <text start="117.659" dur="6.751">these in my water</text>
  <text start="118.65" dur="11.37">save time I kind of all it sometimes the</text>
  <text start="124.41" dur="9.68">boron I&amp;#39;ll do a capful it&amp;#39;s safer than</text>
  <text start="130.02" dur="4.07">water according to what I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="135.92" dur="5.23">magnesium all right this is a</text>
  <text start="138.6" dur="4.17">concentrated magnesium does not take</text>
  <text start="141.15" dur="4.13">much I&amp;#39;ll generally do a cap full of</text>
  <text start="142.77" dur="2.51">that as well</text>
  <text start="145.49" dur="4.45">95% of the world&amp;#39;s deficient in</text>
  <text start="147.48" dur="6.87">magnesium and it is pennies a day if</text>
  <text start="149.94" dur="5.97">that K - all right this is one that I</text>
  <text start="154.35" dur="3.06">can&amp;#39;t necessarily just make it home</text>
  <text start="155.91" dur="4.26">although I think I figured that one out</text>
  <text start="157.41" dur="6.6">now I still buy it for the moment but</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="7.5">this is probably a big chunk of why when</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="7.47">I cracked that tooth it healed this is</text>
  <text start="167.67" dur="5.19">great for bone and teeth and putting the</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="2.81">calcium in the right place because if</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="4.62">you get calcium you don&amp;#39;t have this</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="7.11">which is fairly cheap you will end up</text>
  <text start="177.48" dur="8.759">with calcified heart and arteries</text>
  <text start="181.4" dur="9.97">according to the science and let&amp;#39;s see a</text>
  <text start="186.239" dur="6.871">little apple cider vinegar you probably</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="5.03">don&amp;#39;t want to put that much in unless</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="7.02">you&amp;#39;re used to it you have to build up I</text>
  <text start="196.4" dur="5.589">did take some golden seal alright this</text>
  <text start="200.13" dur="3.93">is one that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about more</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="4.621">recently my maiden wife turned me on to</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="5.25">this one I just realized that it not</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="4.71">only grows local it&amp;#39;s an endangered so</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="3.24">it sells for $100 a pound I might</text>
  <text start="211.32" dur="4.8">actually start growing some of this</text>
  <text start="212.55" dur="6.87">local however it is basically nature&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="7.08">antibiotic it is not a preventative it</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="5.039">is a it is a medicine it&amp;#39;s very strong</text>
  <text start="223.2" dur="3.74">you don&amp;#39;t wanna use it for very long you</text>
  <text start="224.459" dur="5.371">can devastate your good bacteria as well</text>
  <text start="226.94" dur="5.74">but it is a powerful healer for sure</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="4.32">and it even helps me temporarily with my</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="3.09">allergies so I even took a little bit of</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="5.52">that today</text>
  <text start="235.77" dur="6">and I think that is most of the stuff I</text>
  <text start="239.67" dur="5.28">just dump in my water on a daily</text>
  <text start="241.77" dur="4.98">sometimes I will also put nope nope I</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="5.04">miss something before I jump in I also</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="7.74">do iodine of course and occasionally I</text>
  <text start="249.99" dur="9.18">will put in MSM powder all right this is</text>
  <text start="254.49" dur="5.88">sulfur and dissolves right in there</text>
  <text start="259.17" dur="2.94">sometimes it&amp;#39;ll start to settle on the</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="4.53">bottom and it doesn&amp;#39;t taste super great</text>
  <text start="262.11" dur="6.39">but this one&amp;#39;s a very very cheap option</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="5.55">as well and that is it let&amp;#39;s jump into</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="5.48">the news I am true this took a little</text>
  <text start="270.45" dur="6.87">bit longer than I want it to anyway so</text>
  <text start="273.98" dur="4.87">politics in the deep state I want to</text>
  <text start="277.32" dur="3.75">talk a little bit about where we go one</text>
  <text start="278.85" dur="4.83">we go all this is a phrase that you have</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="6.38">probably heard at this point it</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="7.11">originated in the qyn on conspiracy</text>
  <text start="287.45" dur="7.81">community which by the way is very well</text>
  <text start="290.79" dur="6.24">documented at this point q and on is</text>
  <text start="295.26" dur="4.86">real and if you deny it you&amp;#39;re denying</text>
  <text start="297.03" dur="7.95">mathematical probability it&amp;#39;s just my</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="7.11">opinion anyway this phrase is is is more</text>
  <text start="304.98" dur="5.18">than just a catchy phrase it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="307.23" dur="5.72">subtle way of showing a fundamental like</text>
  <text start="310.16" dur="5.02">spiritual level truth I mean this is a</text>
  <text start="312.95" dur="5.56">fundamental truth of the human</text>
  <text start="315.18" dur="5.34">experience and that could possibly be</text>
  <text start="318.51" dur="4.53">part of the source of so much evil in</text>
  <text start="320.52" dur="4.77">this world and that is that we are not</text>
  <text start="323.04" dur="3.81">Islands you know I&amp;#39;m as fully on the</text>
  <text start="325.29" dur="4.23">individualist end of the spectrum as</text>
  <text start="326.85" dur="5.85">possible but we are not Islands and our</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="6.06">culture and our society where it goes we</text>
  <text start="332.7" dur="6.96">follow all right we cannot abdicate our</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="7.32">responsibility to the high light mindset</text>
  <text start="339.66" dur="6.3">you might say of retire and live in</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="6.99">comfort and frivolity and and and</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="5.7">leisure and selfishness and pleasure and</text>
  <text start="349.89" dur="4.11">in those things it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="4.77">hedonistic way of living we need to be</text>
  <text start="354" dur="4.05">warriors willing to eat bugs and live in</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="4.5">the wilderness and have hardship and</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="6">sacrifice to chase righteousness and</text>
  <text start="360.93" dur="6.03">fight for good and how better to say</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="5.22">that than simply where we go one we go</text>
  <text start="366.96" dur="6.56">all right</text>
  <text start="369.27" dur="6.119">yeah so jumping on into the news Russia</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="3.13">wanted to say that for a while right</text>
  <text start="375.389" dur="4.051">I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about that that</text>
  <text start="376.65" dur="4.86">phrase so Russia reiterates warning that</text>
  <text start="379.44" dur="6.6">Trump&amp;#39;s space force could trigger the</text>
  <text start="381.51" dur="6.09">next Cold War and then Russia dumps 50</text>
  <text start="386.04" dur="4.29">you know at the same time around about</text>
  <text start="387.6" dur="5.099">Russia&amp;#39;s dumping 50% of our Treasury</text>
  <text start="390.33" dur="4.23">bills you know our debt and at this</text>
  <text start="392.699" dur="4.291">point we need people to be buying our</text>
  <text start="394.56" dur="4.74">debt and now the biggest holders of our</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="4.02">debt are turning into sellers now this</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="3.69">is just a prelude of what happens when</text>
  <text start="401.01" dur="5.159">China starts to dump which is their</text>
  <text start="402.99" dur="4.5">nuclear option and I&amp;#39;ve been reading</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="3">some stuff about this lately it seems</text>
  <text start="407.49" dur="4.41">like Trump has some things that he can</text>
  <text start="409.169" dur="4.921">try to do such a scale back to the size</text>
  <text start="411.9" dur="5.22">of military spending which is like 50</text>
  <text start="414.09" dur="4.53">percent of our GDP is huge if he could</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="3.87">scale that back we&amp;#39;re a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="418.62" dur="5.4">smaller target in terms of just blowing</text>
  <text start="420.99" dur="5.88">up the dollar in you know in in our debt</text>
  <text start="424.02" dur="6.03">situation by selling all the Treasuries</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="6.03">that China owns so it kind of lessens</text>
  <text start="430.05" dur="5.929">their nuclear option but they do have a</text>
  <text start="432.9" dur="6.09">lot of you know options like that and</text>
  <text start="435.979" dur="5.081">Mexico&amp;#39;s next president boldly declares</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="4.59">that immigration to the u.s. is a human</text>
  <text start="441.06" dur="4.979">right this guy this guy is the one who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="4.41">basically full socialist and gonna be</text>
  <text start="446.039" dur="4.411">taking over all the private corporations</text>
  <text start="447.99" dur="4.859">and stuff and you know nationalizing all</text>
  <text start="450.45" dur="3.96">the profit and then screwing everything</text>
  <text start="452.849" dur="2.371">up and turning Mexico into the next</text>
  <text start="454.41" dur="3.93">Venezuela</text>
  <text start="455.22" dur="5.879">I mean Mexico we kind of think of it as</text>
  <text start="458.34" dur="4.62">our like our you know poor neighbor to</text>
  <text start="461.099" dur="5.461">the south but they&amp;#39;re actually quite a</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="5.61">wealthy nation compared to many in most</text>
  <text start="466.56" dur="4.62">patients and they&amp;#39;re about to go down</text>
  <text start="468.57" dur="4.529">because of that guy I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="5.19">basically like a Mexican Bernie Sanders</text>
  <text start="473.099" dur="5.311">it&amp;#39;s gonna go bad a little bit palsy ER</text>
  <text start="476.37" dur="5.28">I think though he&amp;#39;s probably got some</text>
  <text start="478.41" dur="6.87">more you know whatever it is that makes</text>
  <text start="481.65" dur="8.37">people fighters Bernie doesn&amp;#39;t seem to</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="6.8">have that and Congress wants to give</text>
  <text start="490.02" dur="4.8">jeff sessions more power to than</text>
  <text start="492.08" dur="6.61">substances now we we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="494.82" dur="5.64">substances if you if you start giving</text>
  <text start="498.69" dur="3.84">you know</text>
  <text start="500.46" dur="4.019">real quick disclaimer I think all drugs</text>
  <text start="502.53" dur="3.78">should be legalized not because I want</text>
  <text start="504.479" dur="3.931">people to do drugs because they know</text>
  <text start="506.31" dur="5.1">actually scientifically has been shown</text>
  <text start="508.41" dur="5.04">to make them use it less it takes away</text>
  <text start="511.41" dur="4.83">the taboo factor it takes away the</text>
  <text start="513.45" dur="5.31">profit from the criminals I raises the</text>
  <text start="516.24" dur="3.989">quality and the standards and and you</text>
  <text start="518.76" dur="4.32">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of good things about</text>
  <text start="520.229" dur="4.561">legalization rather than like the death</text>
  <text start="523.08" dur="4.11">penalty and criminalization right that</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="5.609">just makes it more violent and up to the</text>
  <text start="527.19" dur="5.07">profit denotes the ante but when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="530.399" dur="3.781">given the government these broad powers</text>
  <text start="532.26" dur="4.71">to regulate things they start to use it</text>
  <text start="534.18" dur="5.61">against things like supplements right</text>
  <text start="536.97" dur="4.77">how long until I&amp;#39;m not allowed to make</text>
  <text start="539.79" dur="4.38">my own supplements at home anymore</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="4.05">because it&amp;#39;s considered to be an illegal</text>
  <text start="544.17" dur="3.3">drug right</text>
  <text start="545.79" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;ve already you know they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="3.45">this with marijuana I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="549.6" dur="3.33">drug and in fact I&amp;#39;ve got something</text>
  <text start="550.92" dur="5.419">later on them and talk about where the</text>
  <text start="552.93" dur="6.659">FDA has now approved a marijuana drug</text>
  <text start="556.339" dur="5.411">but among the list of things on their on</text>
  <text start="559.589" dur="6.721">their potential targets I actually have</text>
  <text start="561.75" dur="8.82">four here all right so I have three well</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="9.36">two nootropics not three really and I</text>
  <text start="570.57" dur="7.29">have had kratom I&amp;#39;m out I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="575.67" dur="5.4">have any more but I have had it so I</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="4.59">mean there&amp;#39;s residue so right there</text>
  <text start="581.07" dur="3.54">those would be considered illegal drugs</text>
  <text start="582.45" dur="4.62">I consider them homeopathic medicines or</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="4.83">holistic medicines or nootropics are</text>
  <text start="587.07" dur="4.05">more of like a increase your focus and</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="4.26">memory retention kind of thing not</text>
  <text start="591.12" dur="4.62">necessarily a medicine that&amp;#39;s more I</text>
  <text start="593.7" dur="4.71">guess they call it body hacking or</text>
  <text start="595.74" dur="3.839">whatever so this is definitely a</text>
  <text start="598.41" dur="3.69">slippery slope we don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="599.579" dur="4.38">especially with sessions okay he has</text>
  <text start="602.1" dur="4.95">been he has shown that he is very anti</text>
  <text start="603.959" dur="6.451">science about this stuff and the do J&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.05" dur="6.69">IG report released by Horowitz contains</text>
  <text start="610.41" dur="5.76">an entire appendix number two that was</text>
  <text start="613.74" dur="5.789">completely redacted from the report okay</text>
  <text start="616.17" dur="5.039">it was labeled quote law enforcement</text>
  <text start="619.529" dur="3.81">sensitive it&amp;#39;s now being reported that</text>
  <text start="621.209" dur="3.391">the appendix contains damaging</text>
  <text start="623.339" dur="5.311">information on the Obama</text>
  <text start="624.6" dur="6.75">administration&amp;#39;s former AG Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="628.65" dur="4.54">so now Lynch is gonna be under fire as</text>
  <text start="631.35" dur="4.54">to this</text>
  <text start="633.19" dur="4.47">appendix number two comes out now you</text>
  <text start="635.89" dur="4.26">know we&amp;#39;re hearing a lot of stuff about</text>
  <text start="637.66" dur="4.32">like four different reports or at least</text>
  <text start="640.15" dur="4.44">multiple different versions in layers</text>
  <text start="641.98" dur="4.56">and pond layers and I&amp;#39;m sure they have</text>
  <text start="644.59" dur="3.9">all of these backup plans to try to hope</text>
  <text start="646.54" dur="3.39">that if this comes out and then this</text>

  <text start="676.39" dur="4.14">know I want to get the goods but you</text>
  <text start="678.31" dur="4.68">know worth worth hanging around Thursday</text>
  <text start="680.53" dur="5.36">to pay attention to that one Trump calls</text>
  <text start="682.99" dur="5.55">for deporting illegal immigrants with no</text>
  <text start="685.89" dur="3.34">judges or court cases now I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="688.54" dur="3.21">a great idea</text>
  <text start="689.23" dur="4.35">because although I am a voluntary</text>
  <text start="691.75" dur="3.15">aesthetically I&amp;#39;m an anarchist I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="693.58" dur="5.43">believe that we should have government</text>
  <text start="694.9" dur="5.37">or government borders I believe that we</text>
  <text start="699.01" dur="2.97">should be able to have private property</text>
  <text start="700.27" dur="3.95">and private property borders our own</text>
  <text start="701.98" dur="4.65">property borders and you can&amp;#39;t come here</text>
  <text start="704.22" dur="4.27">and until we are allowed to do that with</text>
  <text start="706.63" dur="3.42">no government then we need them to</text>
  <text start="708.49" dur="3.48">enforce our borders because otherwise</text>
  <text start="710.05" dur="3.09">we&amp;#39;re gonna have cultural invasion and</text>
  <text start="711.97" dur="2.58">we&amp;#39;re not going to be anywhere near</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="3.42">capitalism because all of the other</text>
  <text start="714.55" dur="5.9">cultures are socialist and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="716.56" dur="7.8">flooding in so we cannot survive as a</text>
  <text start="720.45" dur="6.22">first world capitalist nation because</text>
  <text start="724.36" dur="4.11">there is an IQ minimum period to</text>
  <text start="726.67" dur="6.39">actually engage in a democratic</text>
  <text start="728.47" dur="7.71">civilization fairly and folks were</text>
  <text start="733.06" dur="4.41">barely barely there now so if that keeps</text>
  <text start="736.18" dur="3.51">flooding in we&amp;#39;re in trouble</text>
  <text start="737.47" dur="5.7">so no they&amp;#39;re not the u.s. citizens they</text>
  <text start="739.69" dur="5.76">don&amp;#39;t have us rights just don&amp;#39;t let them</text>
  <text start="743.17" dur="4.29">come in point a gun at them hit them</text>
  <text start="745.45" dur="3.99">with paintballs something non-lethal</text>
  <text start="747.46" dur="3.66">whatever you got to do don&amp;#39;t let them</text>
  <text start="749.44" dur="3.93">come in have the wall I mean that would</text>
  <text start="751.12" dur="3.87">be a great option right there I mean</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="3.9">then they just can&amp;#39;t walk in and you</text>
  <text start="754.99" dur="6.51">don&amp;#39;t have to like arrest or deport or</text>
  <text start="757.27" dur="7.95">fly back or hurt anyone because you know</text>
  <text start="761.5" dur="5.25">none of that stuff is necessary it is</text>
  <text start="765.22" dur="4.2">funny that the Democrats</text>
  <text start="766.75" dur="4.23">this talk of of children and cages and</text>
  <text start="769.42" dur="5.04">their fake pictures that they made that</text>
  <text start="770.98" dur="6.15">just well everyone knows about now is</text>
  <text start="774.46" dur="3.87">scaring the other illegals back home</text>
  <text start="777.13" dur="2.19">they don&amp;#39;t want to show up they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="778.33" dur="2.49">want to be put in the cage</text>
  <text start="779.32" dur="3.99">so they&amp;#39;re actually slowing down it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="780.82" dur="7.86">great it always backfires on the dims</text>
  <text start="783.31" dur="7.47">and one poll is now saying that 63% of</text>
  <text start="788.68" dur="4.86">Americans say arrest illegals and send</text>
  <text start="790.78" dur="5.81">them home and 21% of Democrat which are</text>
  <text start="793.54" dur="7.44">Democrats say they want them released</text>
  <text start="796.59" dur="7.18">so from Andrew Boston even CBS</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="5.91">battleground poll that is plus 8% dem</text>
  <text start="803.77" dur="5.94">shows over twice as many Americans</text>
  <text start="806.89" dur="4.38">48% want illegal migrant families</text>

  <text start="819.64" dur="4.56">majority we outnumber them two to one</text>
  <text start="821.5" dur="4.61">folks because this is pretty much Trump</text>
  <text start="824.2" dur="4.2">versus the non Trump&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="826.11" dur="4.84">everything is polarized everything now</text>
  <text start="828.4" dur="5.61">is is we have the battle lines drawn</text>
  <text start="830.95" dur="4.4">there&amp;#39;s not really too much in the</text>
  <text start="834.01" dur="3.96">middle except for just the people that</text>
  <text start="835.35" dur="4.27">have the blinders on like horses they</text>
  <text start="837.97" dur="4.05">just don&amp;#39;t see anything they don&amp;#39;t care</text>

  <text start="842.02" dur="5.99">care and honestly I think that&amp;#39;s I think</text>
  <text start="844.57" dur="3.44">that&amp;#39;s about half of it right there</text>
  <text start="848.73" dur="4.18">versus yeah</text>
  <text start="850.36" dur="5.01">21% who approved granting temporary and</text>
  <text start="852.91" dur="4.23">entry and allowing Eagle illegals to</text>

  <text start="857.14" dur="4.65">release which never works</text>
  <text start="858.85" dur="5.91">period they just don&amp;#39;t throw up I would</text>
  <text start="861.79" dur="4.65">think like you have to understand human</text>

  <text start="866.44" dur="6.02">you&amp;#39;re looking at human behavior and and</text>
  <text start="869.32" dur="6.51">and frankly it just yeah it&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="872.46" dur="5.23">they set up all the incentives against</text>
  <text start="875.83" dur="3.66">what we would like to see they set up</text>
  <text start="877.69" dur="6.12">incentives and education against</text>
  <text start="879.49" dur="6.99">learning they set up incentives in in</text>
  <text start="883.81" dur="4.5">any system that you can imagine like in</text>
  <text start="886.48" dur="5.06">the economic system they set it up</text>
  <text start="888.31" dur="6.15">against creativity and innovation I mean</text>
  <text start="891.54" dur="7.419">anyway I think the golden still is not</text>
  <text start="894.46" dur="5.61">quite working AG so let&amp;#39;s talk about Mad</text>
  <text start="898.959" dur="2.611">Magazine I&amp;#39;m actually going</text>

  <text start="904.39" dur="7.2">Maxine so this quote from Lara Loomer</text>
  <text start="909.25" dur="4.11">Twitter Maxine Waters called for the</text>
  <text start="911.59" dur="3.75">harassment of Trump supporters this</text>
  <text start="913.36" dur="3.99">weekend she literally told her</text>
  <text start="915.34" dur="3.66">supporters to publicly harass anyone</text>
  <text start="917.35" dur="4.02">working in the current Trump</text>
  <text start="919" dur="4.59">administration I wonder how she would</text>
  <text start="921.37" dur="6.39">feel about being confronted by the</text>
  <text start="923.59" dur="8.13">general public so what&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="927.76" dur="5.7">is of course Sarah Huckabee Sanders got</text>
  <text start="931.72" dur="3.3">kicked out of the the red hen restaurant</text>
  <text start="933.46" dur="3.66">which I think now is going under or</text>
  <text start="935.02" dur="4.95">something because there&amp;#39;s some flack</text>
  <text start="937.12" dur="6.21">going back to them which of course the</text>
  <text start="939.97" dur="8.48">owner was a former lefty journalist I</text>
  <text start="943.33" dur="8.04">think at some point so real SJW type and</text>
  <text start="948.45" dur="4.36">and also at the same time or I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="951.37" dur="2.97">know which exactly happened first I</text>
  <text start="952.81" dur="5.46">think the kicking out of the restaurant</text>
  <text start="954.34" dur="7.11">happened first I don&amp;#39;t follow the drama</text>
  <text start="958.27" dur="8.03">but then Maxine Waters comes out with</text>
  <text start="961.45" dur="8.84">this this statement and it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="966.3" dur="7.11">what was the quote what did she say</text>
  <text start="970.29" dur="5.32">create a crowd and push back on them</text>
  <text start="973.41" dur="5.26">that is what she said</text>
  <text start="975.61" dur="5.13">all right that is a direct quote and now</text>
  <text start="978.67" dur="3.45">of course you know what I&amp;#39;m not even</text>
  <text start="980.74" dur="3.06">support let&amp;#39;s go through the whole list</text>
  <text start="982.12" dur="4.59">there&amp;#39;s a lot to deal with this so we</text>
  <text start="983.8" dur="5.06">also have she could be facing five years</text>
  <text start="986.71" dur="7.43">in prison for inciting a riot all right</text>
  <text start="988.86" dur="8.65">and Cory Booker by the way was of course</text>
  <text start="994.14" dur="5.86">joining in on this he was with her now</text>
  <text start="997.51" dur="7.88">after that happened both Schumer and</text>
  <text start="1000" dur="8.82">Pelosi sort of kind of like like</text>
  <text start="1005.39" dur="4.96">distanced himself like it in in the way</text>
  <text start="1008.82" dur="3.69">that you know that they love what she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1010.35" dur="4.23">doing but they don&amp;#39;t want necessarily to</text>
  <text start="1012.51" dur="4.29">be associated with his sumit Maxine is</text>
  <text start="1014.58" dur="4.44">the wild card right but she went too far</text>
  <text start="1016.8" dur="4.08">out on this limb and then she got a</text>
  <text start="1019.02" dur="5.1">little bit scared and then she went on I</text>
  <text start="1020.88" dur="3.93">think it was CBS she went on TV and she</text>
  <text start="1024.12" dur="3.089">cries</text>
  <text start="1024.81" dur="3.84">she&amp;#39;d well she alligator cries right and</text>
  <text start="1027.209" dur="4.891">she actually deflects and she starts</text>

  <text start="2206.4" dur="9.6">u.s. Rock River thousands of gallons of</text>
  <text start="2212.43" dur="7.29">oil now you can see basically it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2216" dur="4.98">a water flood it&amp;#39;s like the houses are</text>
  <text start="2219.72" dur="2.76">flooded you would think it&amp;#39;s like after</text>

  <text start="2225.869" dur="8.761">some unhealthy land for a while there</text>
  <text start="2230.43" dur="6.33">that&amp;#39;s terrible but look at this oil</text>
  <text start="2234.63" dur="4.469">spill Oh No okay so some of that is</text>
  <text start="2236.76" dur="5.64">water I guess but this is this is oil</text>
  <text start="2239.099" dur="6.301">like coating on top of it cuz you know</text>
  <text start="2242.4" dur="5.25">how oil and water they don&amp;#39;t mix that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2245.4" dur="5.39">why it&amp;#39;s so dark anyway so that is that</text>
  <text start="2247.65" dur="6.39">is ironic and interesting and in sadly</text>
  <text start="2250.79" dur="5.44">darkly humorous because the people that</text>
  <text start="2254.04" dur="3.96">tried to stop the oil pipeline they</text>
  <text start="2256.23" dur="3.09">really were there to try to protect the</text>
  <text start="2258" dur="2.52">environment most of them and then they</text>
  <text start="2259.32" dur="3.6">only ended up harming the environment</text>
  <text start="2260.52" dur="4.71">because the pipeline is the safest way</text>
  <text start="2262.92" dur="4.35">to transport this crap I would rather we</text>
  <text start="2265.23" dur="3.66">just release some of that hidden</text>
  <text start="2267.27" dur="4.319">technology and then we get on with some</text>
  <text start="2268.89" dur="5.19">more efficient stuff but it is</text>
  <text start="2271.589" dur="3.991">interesting that you know that is the</text>
  <text start="2274.08" dur="4.95">safest way to move oil while we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="2275.58" dur="5.279">using oil now idea I would I do want to</text>
  <text start="2279.03" dur="7.53">mention real fast I did come across one</text>

  <text start="2286.56" dur="3.15">you put on your fridge that is supposed</text>
  <text start="2288.15" dur="2.459">to reduce and they have videos where</text>
  <text start="2289.71" dur="2.73">they should they&amp;#39;ve go down some</text>
  <text start="2290.609" dur="4.471">evidence and they and they stand by it</text>
  <text start="2292.44" dur="5.1">actually like to make the claim I was</text>
  <text start="2295.08" dur="3.96">asking them an email like we are you</text>
  <text start="2297.54" dur="4.2">sure like you actually claim this and</text>
  <text start="2299.04" dur="4.95">then they they said yes and that it will</text>
  <text start="2301.74" dur="4.379">lower your power bill like 20% on the</text>
  <text start="2303.99" dur="4.5">fridge so that&amp;#39;s interesting talking</text>
  <text start="2306.119" dur="5.25">about energy and stuff if that is true</text>
  <text start="2308.49" dur="4.68">if that starts to take off is this kind</text>
  <text start="2311.369" dur="4.021">of a new thing if that starts to take</text>
  <text start="2313.17" dur="2.929">off then that&amp;#39;s already quite incredible</text>

  <text start="2451.589" dur="10.02">so it then crashed I mean it smashed</text>
  <text start="2454.739" dur="9.84">back down to around less than seven</text>
  <text start="2461.609" dur="5.331">seventy three hundred basically and then</text>

  <text start="2495.18" dur="4.47">down here so if you actually can i zoom</text>
  <text start="2497.64" dur="8.78">in on this chart I don&amp;#39;t think I can on</text>
  <text start="2499.65" dur="6.77">this one let me show you my real short</text>
  <text start="2506.45" dur="12.609">yeah okay this is EOS that setup</text>
  <text start="2509.96" dur="12.42">similarly let&amp;#39;s do a still one month all</text>
  <text start="2519.059" dur="6.021">right well yeah one month</text>
  <text start="2522.38" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;m gonna zoom in a bit so this goes</text>
  <text start="2525.08" dur="6.69">back to 2017 basically it was a one-year</text>
  <text start="2528.11" dur="6.24">IC o---- it built way up here then it</text>
  <text start="2531.77" dur="4.86">launched and then it has smashed Balan</text>
  <text start="2534.35" dur="3.84">on bad news right because it had a</text>
  <text start="2536.63" dur="3.36">couple complications there was a few</text>
  <text start="2538.19" dur="4.77">delays people didn&amp;#39;t vote fast enough</text>
  <text start="2539.99" dur="6.33">there was like a they had to like to</text>
  <text start="2542.96" dur="5.04">tweak a few things but this is not like</text>
  <text start="2546.32" dur="3.6">a program that&amp;#39;s just gonna fall or flop</text>
  <text start="2548" dur="3.9">or anything plus China just endorsed it</text>
  <text start="2549.92" dur="4.23">basically so now we&amp;#39;re sitting here at</text>
  <text start="2551.9" dur="4.56">this lake bottom it&amp;#39;s back down almost</text>
  <text start="2554.15" dur="8.43">to where I bought it and like six</text>
  <text start="2556.46" dur="8.67">something six and a half before so it is</text>
  <text start="2562.58" dur="4.44">in my opinion like the cheapest it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2565.13" dur="4.95">ever gonna be not just for EOS but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2567.02" dur="5.01">go to Bitcoin and this is eos versus</text>
  <text start="2570.08" dur="7.11">dollars not the coin this is a bitcoin</text>
  <text start="2572.03" dur="8.04">versus dollars now back in here in the</text>
  <text start="2577.19" dur="6.18">pennies and you go away up to that big</text>
  <text start="2580.07" dur="6.24">jump now smash and back down i mean it</text>
  <text start="2583.37" dur="7.08">could go back down to a who knows it</text>
  <text start="2586.31" dur="5.73">could go back down to 3,000 maybe I</text>
  <text start="2590.45" dur="3.57">doubt it people are not thinking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2592.04" dur="4.92">gonna go there and you can kind of see</text>
  <text start="2594.02" dur="4.92">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s more bad bad news right</text>

  <text start="2601.97" dur="6.78">opinions that they&amp;#39;re talking about you</text>
  <text start="2604.13" dur="7.41">know but I don&amp;#39;t care if it goes down</text>
  <text start="2608.75" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ll buy more i&amp;#39;ll dollar-cost average I</text>
  <text start="2611.54" dur="3.12">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna go down I think</text>
  <text start="2613.16" dur="2.94">we&amp;#39;re basically at the bottom of this</text>
  <text start="2614.66" dur="4.2">market and it&amp;#39;s about to go through the</text>
  <text start="2616.1" dur="6.3">roof but we do have that you know</text>
  <text start="2618.86" dur="5.13">continuing trend line which I know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2622.4" dur="5.1">not an expert of the charge so I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2623.99" dur="5.61">really uh I don&amp;#39;t know how to make the</text>
  <text start="2627.5" dur="5.25">line and show you but you know you can</text>
  <text start="2629.6" dur="4.95">kind of tell and if that continues then</text>
  <text start="2632.75" dur="3.87">we&amp;#39;re sort of we&amp;#39;re sort of at this</text>
  <text start="2634.55" dur="3.96">bottom or close to it and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2636.62" dur="3.75">gonna shoot back up and then it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2638.51" dur="3.42">crash back down it&amp;#39;s gonna go back up</text>
  <text start="2640.37" dur="4.08">even higher just like this thing always</text>
  <text start="2641.93" dur="4.65">does that&amp;#39;s Bitcoin that is the history</text>
  <text start="2644.45" dur="4.8">of Bitcoin that is the standard of</text>
  <text start="2646.58" dur="4.53">Bitcoin it&amp;#39;s just typical of Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="2649.25" dur="3.18">that is not typical of every other</text>
  <text start="2651.11" dur="5.1">market so that is different to</text>
