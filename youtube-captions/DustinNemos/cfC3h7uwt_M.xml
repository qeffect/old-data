  <text start="14.23" dur="5.08">hey guys this is destiny Mouse welcome</text>
  <text start="16.91" dur="5.189">back this is gonna be a real quick</text>
  <text start="19.31" dur="4.14">health video now obviously not medical</text>
  <text start="22.099" dur="3.781">advice or anything like that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="23.45" dur="5.52">wanna get sued for somebody choking on</text>
  <text start="25.88" dur="7.199">their milk or something but I bring to</text>
  <text start="28.97" dur="5.46">you raw milk yes yes raw milk that stuff</text>
  <text start="33.079" dur="4.581">that&amp;#39;s pretty much illegal to buy</text>
  <text start="34.43" dur="5.3">everywhere not to buy Gus but to sell</text>
  <text start="37.66" dur="3.669">unfortunately shouldn&amp;#39;t be but</text>
  <text start="39.73" dur="3.97">encroaching overreaching federal</text>
  <text start="41.329" dur="5.761">government and banning everything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="43.7" dur="5.25">good for you of course and kefir okay so</text>
  <text start="47.09" dur="4.62">this is actually really it&amp;#39;s just like</text>
  <text start="48.95" dur="4.71">ten bucks on Amazon do review checks and</text>
  <text start="51.71" dur="3.33">everything but you kind of see it in</text>
  <text start="53.66" dur="5.1">there it looks a little bit like wet</text>
  <text start="55.04" dur="5.91">cauliflower and this is the simplest</text>
  <text start="58.76" dur="3.72">thing that you can do as far as making</text>
  <text start="60.95" dur="5.07">your own stuff at home and saving money</text>
  <text start="62.48" dur="4.92">okay kefir is a probiotic a lot of</text>
  <text start="66.02" dur="2.79">people think it tastes bad you can add</text>
  <text start="67.4" dur="2.85">your own flavors I&amp;#39;m gonna add a little</text>
  <text start="68.81" dur="7.349">bit of maple syrup to mine when I drink</text>
  <text start="70.25" dur="7.77">it but you put it in the milk and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.159" dur="6.5">it you let you let it sit out overnight</text>
  <text start="78.02" dur="6.839">room temperature for 24 to 36 hours</text>
  <text start="82.659" dur="4.42">there&amp;#39;s a little bit of a variable just</text>
  <text start="84.859" dur="4.08">depending on how big this chunk is</text>
  <text start="87.079" dur="4.74">because obviously bigger will will</text>
  <text start="88.939" dur="4.38">ferment faster and this is one of the</text>
  <text start="91.819" dur="3.12">best things that you can do at home one</text>
  <text start="93.319" dur="3.75">of the simplest probiotics that you can</text>
  <text start="94.939" dur="3.72">make and obviously probiotics are</text>
  <text start="97.069" dur="3.601">probably the most important thing that</text>
  <text start="98.659" dur="2.55">you can take at least according to</text>
  <text start="100.67" dur="2.789">Mercola</text>
  <text start="101.209" dur="4.91">in terms of supplements and stuff</text>
  <text start="103.459" dur="5.43">because everything else that you take</text>
  <text start="106.119" dur="5.17">everything passes through the gut okay</text>
  <text start="108.889" dur="3.781">so the gut if it&amp;#39;s healthy will have a</text>
  <text start="111.289" dur="2.58">better absorption rate if it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="112.67" dur="2.759">healthy doesn&amp;#39;t matter what</text>
  <text start="113.869" dur="3.18">multivitamins or anything else you take</text>
  <text start="115.429" dur="6.21">because you&amp;#39;re not going to get the</text>
  <text start="117.049" dur="7.71">absorption GMOs things that are doused</text>
  <text start="121.639" dur="4.98">in pesticides before eating everything</text>
  <text start="124.759" dur="4.56">like that is going to really wreck your</text>
  <text start="126.619" dur="4.021">your gut and your gut is way more</text>
  <text start="129.319" dur="3.061">important than people think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="130.64" dur="4.47">large part of your brainpower as well</text>
  <text start="132.38" dur="4.38">your central nervous system is centered</text>
  <text start="135.11" dur="5.16">as much around your gut as it is your</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="5.55">brain so basically the recipe calls for</text>
  <text start="140.27" dur="4.21">some kefir grains and two cups of milk</text>
  <text start="142.31" dur="6.28">let&amp;#39;s sit overnight you&amp;#39;re good to go</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="6.21">now that said this stuff is going to</text>
  <text start="148.59" dur="4.38">start to grow pretty fast and soon</text>
  <text start="150.69" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;ll have a lot more of it than you</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="3.47">started with you can give it to friends</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="4.41">or you can start two batches or you can</text>
  <text start="156.44" dur="7">just put some of it in the refrigerator</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="6.599">it&amp;#39;ll last quite a while there and it</text>
  <text start="163.44" dur="4.019">will it will begin like I said to</text>
  <text start="165.269" dur="4.231">culture faster so you could cut down on</text>
  <text start="167.459" dur="4.021">the amount of times you&amp;#39;re doing when</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="5.069">you&amp;#39;re finished with this you&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="4.77">strain it out you might have to separate</text>
  <text start="174.569" dur="4.291">some of the stuff you know clean it out</text>
  <text start="176.25" dur="5.519">and then just dump this in another cup</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="6.57">of milk or two cups of milk and start</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="5.161">over and drink your first keeper kefir</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="2.97">is not something that everybody enjoys</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="4.139">as far as the taste goes I actually</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="4.83">quite enjoyed kefir I always got like</text>
  <text start="191.069" dur="3.45">the blueberry kefir at the store for for</text>
  <text start="193.23" dur="4.68">like eight bucks or something really</text>
  <text start="194.519" dur="5.071">expensive but that&amp;#39;s a waste of money</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="4.889">when you can do something like this at</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="5.369">home very simple now I don&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="202.799" dur="5.91">works as well with ultra pasteurized</text>
  <text start="204.959" dur="6.12">milk so you&amp;#39;ll have to do your research</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="8.191">on that I fortunately have access to</text>
  <text start="211.079" dur="7.261">some organic raw milk here but generally</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="4.86">in most places you can still buy raw</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="4.89">milk as pet milk just not for human</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="4.289">consumption is kind of the rule that you</text>
  <text start="223.23" dur="5.4">have to go by to keep the farmer safe</text>
  <text start="226.049" dur="5.071">and that&amp;#39;s unfortunate because the</text>
  <text start="228.63" dur="4.109">federal government will treat selling</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="4.949">raw milk worse than they will selling</text>
  <text start="232.739" dur="5.34">heroin in many cases and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="236.069" dur="3.991">have been you know arrested or shut down</text>
  <text start="238.079" dur="5.25">or family businesses ruined because they</text>
  <text start="240.06" dur="6">wanted to provide a valuable product and</text>
  <text start="243.329" dur="5.701">service to the local community by</text>
  <text start="246.06" dur="5.64">selling them raw milk and of course the</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="4.17">federal government used their their</text>
  <text start="251.7" dur="4.259">authority under the Commerce Clause</text>
  <text start="253.2" dur="3.99">which is basically only trading over</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="3.06">state lines they have no authority</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="3.57">within state lines over that clause but</text>
  <text start="259.019" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;ve taken the authority which is</text>
  <text start="260.76" dur="4.969">what federal government&amp;#39;s always do</text>
  <text start="262.169" dur="7.201">right they always grow in power and</text>
  <text start="265.729" dur="5.391">never shrink anyway hope you guys have</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="5.019">enjoyed this I am going</text>
  <text start="271.12" dur="6.54">who love drinking this tomorrow when</text>
  <text start="274.389" dur="4.951">it&amp;#39;s ready about this time I can&amp;#39;t wait</text>
  <text start="277.66" dur="4.229">I&amp;#39;ve been really looking forward to this</text>
  <text start="279.34" dur="4.079">and it took it took longer than a few</text>
  <text start="281.889" dur="3.121">days to get here in the mail so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="283.419" dur="4.231">been kind of waiting impatiently for it</text>
  <text start="285.01" dur="4.469">anyway that&amp;#39;s it for today stay tuned</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="3.51">because sometime in the near future when</text>
  <text start="289.479" dur="5.101">I get my notes organized and I have a</text>
  <text start="291.16" dur="5.28">place behind me that I can you know show</text>
  <text start="294.58" dur="3.21">off my my different supplements I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="296.44" dur="3.449">going to go through a couple different</text>
  <text start="297.79" dur="5.04">ones and show you guys kind of some of</text>
  <text start="299.889" dur="6.75">the stuff I do including homemade iodine</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="7.619">homemade magnesium homemade I think I</text>
  <text start="306.639" dur="7.291">already did boron borax different things</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="5.311">like that that you can do at home you</text>
  <text start="313.93" dur="4.62">know I&amp;#39;ve gotten some some weird</text>
  <text start="315.76" dur="6.48">feedback on the borax one person that</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="5.36">said they&amp;#39;re a nutritional trained in</text>
  <text start="322.24" dur="4.32">nutrition I forget what they were saying</text>
  <text start="323.91" dur="5.95">dietician or something saying borax is</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="5.88">so bad don&amp;#39;t do that in my research it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="329.86" dur="5.13">not I haven&amp;#39;t seen anything in fact the</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="3.539">otaku city reports on borax are lower</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="2.97">than that of salt</text>
  <text start="335.979" dur="4.651">so in fact table salt is is more</text>
  <text start="337.96" dur="4.41">poisonous to you than borax with the</text>
  <text start="340.63" dur="5.67">exception of infants in which case Forex</text>
  <text start="342.37" dur="5.58">is lethal and things like that so you</text>
  <text start="346.3" dur="2.91">know we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna go over</text>
  <text start="347.95" dur="3">those things we&amp;#39;re gonna go over how</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="4.079">simple it is generally it&amp;#39;s just mixed</text>
  <text start="350.95" dur="3.3">this much with with this much water stir</text>
  <text start="353.289" dur="3.661">let&amp;#39;s sit</text>
  <text start="354.25" dur="4.83">leave in the dark whatever dark bottles</text>
  <text start="356.95" dur="4.589">things like that because a lot of these</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="4.35">compounds and solutions are sensitive to</text>
  <text start="361.539" dur="4.291">light some other things that you can</text>
  <text start="363.43" dur="4.53">make at home like Lloyd will sell for</text>
  <text start="365.83" dur="3.57">things like that require machines I</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t have access to that unfortunately</text>
