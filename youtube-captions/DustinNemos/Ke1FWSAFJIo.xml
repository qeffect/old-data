  <text start="17.5" dur="6.82">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="19.94" dur="6.45">Mouse and Athena I have found something</text>
  <text start="24.32" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s very exciting and kind of</text>
  <text start="26.39" dur="5.009">simplifies my life and I think may help</text>
  <text start="29.27" dur="5.7">simplify some of yours it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="31.399" dur="6.481">political it&amp;#39;s crypto stuff so turn it</text>
  <text start="34.97" dur="7.26">off if that&amp;#39;s a topic that you hate out</text>
  <text start="37.88" dur="6.359">of some of you do but you can buy very</text>
  <text start="42.23" dur="4.52">conveniently Bitcoin and other</text>
  <text start="44.239" dur="2.511">Kryptonian</text>
  <text start="47.86" dur="4.81">now this makes it a lot easier than</text>
  <text start="50.27" dur="4.47">having to go through an exchange there</text>
  <text start="52.67" dur="3.06">are probably some higher fees I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="54.74" dur="3.99">even know what the fees are they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="55.73" dur="4.29">too bad but generally speaking when you</text>
  <text start="58.73" dur="2.73">want to buy Bitcoin it&amp;#39;s because you</text>
  <text start="60.02" dur="3.27">think it&amp;#39;s gonna go up anyway and the</text>
  <text start="61.46" dur="3.629">fee can be very small compared to the</text>
  <text start="63.29" dur="2.46">gain over the course of even a few days</text>
  <text start="65.089" dur="4.621">sometimes</text>
  <text start="65.75" dur="5.97">so especially now with it being so so so</text>
  <text start="69.71" dur="3.54">very low to buy Bitcoin because if you</text>
  <text start="71.72" dur="5.34">have them in paying attention everything</text>
  <text start="73.25" dur="8.85">is crashed to basically very very very</text>
  <text start="77.06" dur="6.54">low lows for recent times but if you pay</text>
  <text start="82.1" dur="2.55">attention to the long term and McAfee</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="3.57">really points us out</text>
  <text start="84.65" dur="4.92">the best I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact</text>
  <text start="87.17" dur="4.92">quote but basically he keep the the long</text>
  <text start="89.57" dur="3.93">game in mind compared to last year we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="92.09" dur="4.889">still up like double or something it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="93.5" dur="5.76">really ridiculous and that kind of that</text>
  <text start="96.979" dur="4.231">kind of growth has been accelerating so</text>
  <text start="99.26" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re gonna have this erratic boom and</text>
  <text start="101.21" dur="4.53">then fall boom and fall but you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="103.58" dur="4.62">take two steps forward one step back and</text>
  <text start="105.74" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s the key to remember is over the</text>
  <text start="108.2" dur="6.09">long term this up down up down up down</text>
  <text start="110.42" dur="6.18">is mostly up and very quickly up if you</text>
  <text start="114.29" dur="7.02">really pay attention to the trend now</text>
  <text start="116.6" dur="6.48">that said people can make or break the</text>
  <text start="121.31" dur="4.29">bank trying to play those ups and downs</text>
  <text start="123.08" dur="4.859">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where a lot of the the</text>
  <text start="125.6" dur="7.169">heartbreak stories come in for those who</text>
  <text start="127.939" dur="7.141">buy hold or hobble and you know dollar</text>
  <text start="132.769" dur="4.381">cost average you&amp;#39;re gonna be pretty</text>
  <text start="135.08" dur="4.5">happy in the long term I think just my</text>
  <text start="137.15" dur="3.979">opinion not not financial advice but let</text>
  <text start="139.58" dur="5.309">me jump over here and show you guys</text>
  <text start="141.129" dur="5.021">change le dot-com I want it I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="144.889" dur="2.55">excited about this and I</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="3.509">did get an affiliate link for sure</text>
  <text start="147.439" dur="3.931">because I love this website here we go</text>
  <text start="149.659" dur="3.541">out real briefly and I&amp;#39;m not even gonna</text>
  <text start="151.37" dur="3.69">use one of my own videos but I want to</text>
  <text start="153.2" dur="4.91">show you guys just for those who do not</text>
  <text start="155.06" dur="6.48">know down below the video in youtube</text>
  <text start="158.11" dur="6.01">there is a description box and in that</text>
  <text start="161.54" dur="4.44">description box you will find all sorts</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="3.509">of useful links including my source</text>
  <text start="165.98" dur="6.479">material for the daily news I do</text>
  <text start="167.629" dur="7.261">and Athena says hi and you will also</text>
  <text start="172.459" dur="4.62">find an affiliate link which will take</text>
  <text start="174.89" dur="4.709">you right over here to this really neat</text>
  <text start="177.079" dur="5.91">changeling comm website where you can</text>
  <text start="179.599" dur="5.28">buy Bitcoin or really neatly you can</text>
  <text start="182.989" dur="4.321">actually buy aetherium or Bitcoin cash</text>
  <text start="184.879" dur="3.78">now this is neat because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="187.31" dur="4.829">little bit of difference between the</text>
  <text start="188.659" dur="5.371">three obviously bitcoin BTC was the</text>
  <text start="192.139" dur="5.011">first right that&amp;#39;s the that&amp;#39;s the big</text>
  <text start="194.03" dur="7.14">giant in the in the in the space right</text>
  <text start="197.15" dur="6.86">now but it&amp;#39;s losing market share to the</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="5.76">newer and more innovative companies</text>
  <text start="204.01" dur="7.059">including Bitcoin cash which is kind of</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="6.179">more it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an offshoot of Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="211.069" dur="3.42">itself and it has lower fees and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="213.109" dur="3.09">done some some things a little bit</text>
  <text start="214.489" dur="4.411">differently and it&amp;#39;s gaining popularity</text>
  <text start="216.199" dur="4.47">very quickly so some hate it some love</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="2.699">it it&amp;#39;s very controversial the</text>
  <text start="220.669" dur="3.93">difference there&amp;#39;s some bad blood</text>
  <text start="221.599" dur="4.441">between the two but they&amp;#39;re very they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.599" dur="4.56">very effective so far and they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="226.04" dur="8.279">some pretty astounding growth already at</text>
  <text start="229.159" dur="8.371">top five and aetherium is kind of a 2.0</text>
  <text start="234.319" dur="5.73">era crypto and also the most popular by</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="4.47">use and second most popular in terms of</text>
  <text start="240.049" dur="5.37">you know money involved</text>
  <text start="242" dur="5.79">so most users of all in terms of you</text>
  <text start="245.419" dur="4.44">know popularity number wise and the</text>
  <text start="247.79" dur="3.839">theorem is is a great it&amp;#39;s it has a lot</text>
  <text start="249.859" dur="3.511">more to offer them than Bitcoin and</text>
  <text start="251.629" dur="3.45">Bitcoin cash it has some more contracts</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="4.56">and it&amp;#39;s a platform that other things</text>
  <text start="255.079" dur="4.47">can be built on top of I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="257.93" dur="3.419">something better now which is the</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="6.09">nickname the etherium killer and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.349" dur="6.241">eos which just launched so i think that</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="3.691">over time is going to displace a theory</text>
  <text start="267.59" dur="3">of in bitcoin as the number one but if</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="3.48">theorem is gonna be around for quite a</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="4.73">while and that really is a good option</text>
  <text start="272.81" dur="5.039">and you&amp;#39;re gonna find that with bitcoin</text>
  <text start="275.32" dur="3.06">BTC you&amp;#39;re gonna pay slightly higher</text>
  <text start="277.849" dur="3.201">fees</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re transacting whereas with VCH or</text>
  <text start="281.05" dur="2.04">etherium your fees are going to be a</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="5.13">little bit lower</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="6.63">I know Berger I know and here is what I</text>
  <text start="287.44" dur="4.68">also wanted to fund us to suggest as</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="5.01">well for those who like to donate to me</text>
  <text start="292.12" dur="4.08">it would be greatly appreciated and you</text>
  <text start="294.73" dur="3.21">know not a it&amp;#39;s an optional thing you</text>
  <text start="296.2" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t have to do this but greatly</text>
  <text start="297.94" dur="3.63">appreciated on my end for a myriad of</text>
  <text start="300.19" dur="3.96">reasons as well as the fact that they</text>
  <text start="301.57" dur="4.05">just can&amp;#39;t censor me this way they can</text>
  <text start="304.15" dur="3.21">never take away this sort of thing like</text>
  <text start="305.62" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ll ban me on patreon one day just</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="5.19">like they did on GoFundMe but they can</text>
  <text start="309.07" dur="5.25">never take this away so this is a great</text>
  <text start="312.55" dur="4.29">option that is basically censorship</text>
  <text start="314.32" dur="5.4">resistant thanks to the decentralized</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="5.46">nature of the crypto blockchain</text>
  <text start="319.72" dur="4.38">technology but what I would really</text>
  <text start="322.3" dur="4.35">appreciate you guys doing if you are</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="4.08">wanting to support the show and maybe if</text>
  <text start="326.65" dur="3.81">you haven&amp;#39;t in the past maybe this will</text>
  <text start="328.18" dur="5.21">be a call to arms</text>
  <text start="330.46" dur="5.37">she&amp;#39;s so talkative today isn&amp;#39;t she I</text>
  <text start="333.39" dur="4.84">would appreciate you actually sending</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="3.78">the etherium or Bitcoin cash because it</text>
  <text start="338.23" dur="3.54">does have a little bit lower fees and</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="4.2">you know I&amp;#39;m working on some fairly thin</text>
  <text start="341.77" dur="3.99">margins here as far as you know being a</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="5.01">youtuber and and this is kind of a</text>
  <text start="345.76" dur="4.74">bootstrap project overall so Bitcoin</text>
