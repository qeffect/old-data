  <text start="296.44" dur="6.63">have to worry about it too much it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="344.96" dur="6.63">weight while I did a a month of caffeine</text>
  <text start="349.36" dur="4.12">I don&amp;#39;t usually drink a lot of caffeine</text>

  <text start="371.12" dur="4.02">involved in a couple of different</text>
  <text start="372.89" dur="4.65">businesses now we&amp;#39;re gonna try to fight</text>
  <text start="375.14" dur="5.34">evil using capitalism it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="377.54" dur="4.44">glorious I hope but I hope that we can</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="3.84">do some good one of those things for</text>
  <text start="381.98" dur="5.64">example is trying to get general Flynn</text>
  <text start="384.32" dur="6.6">some money simple enough to read you</text>
  <text start="387.62" dur="5.37">know kind of replenish what he lost my</text>
  <text start="390.92" dur="4.29">idea my hope my sincere hope and I have</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="3.98">no idea what that number is is that we</text>
  <text start="395.21" dur="4.59">could get him back every dollar he lost</text>
  <text start="396.97" dur="3.49">defending himself I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="4.47">possible</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="5.43">but I know she already loves cellphones</text>
  <text start="404.27" dur="4.29">mr. Knight I don&amp;#39;t let her get near them</text>
  <text start="405.89" dur="5.3">but she already takes like toys and</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="12.33">tries to make a cell phone have it I</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="13.93">don&amp;#39;t want peanut butter on my shirt so</text>
  <text start="420.89" dur="8.31">um you know that&amp;#39;s gonna be the book of</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="6.84">cumin on.com that&amp;#39;s not up yet probably</text>
  <text start="429.2" dur="5.01">within a day or two and that&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="431.96" dur="5.1">all proceeds on that website from the</text>
  <text start="434.21" dur="4.53">sale of the Q book which is just it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="437.06" dur="3.06">private project the other authors you</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="3.66">know the publisher they&amp;#39;re not and all</text>
  <text start="440.12" dur="5.16">for anything they&amp;#39;re welcome to endorse</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="4.35">it but it&amp;#39;s a retail website so I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="445.28" dur="2.7">still be buying like any other retail</text>
  <text start="446.75" dur="3.87">website would</text>
  <text start="447.98" dur="5.4">I&amp;#39;m gonna sell all proceeds on that</text>
  <text start="450.62" dur="4.62">website will go to the Flynn defense I</text>
  <text start="453.38" dur="6.15">kind of jokingly call it the offense</text>
  <text start="455.24" dur="6.15">month so it&amp;#39;s kind of my gift to the</text>
  <text start="459.53" dur="3.93">floods for what they&amp;#39;ve been through but</text>
  <text start="461.39" dur="5.01">really it&amp;#39;s just where we go one way the</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="8.88">wall again trying to do something right</text>
  <text start="466.4" dur="8.34">in the world I do also have interesting</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="3.96">enough a cellphone company yeah mr.</text>
  <text start="474.74" dur="3.69">Knight you said what about the cellphone</text>
  <text start="476.3" dur="4.86">company we could send enough smoke</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="9.72">signals the Indians did it we had two</text>
  <text start="481.16" dur="8.4">code talkers that&amp;#39;s funny the rest about</text>
  <text start="488.15" dur="3.78">it will repeat but yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.56" dur="4.41">funny and it&amp;#39;s true the cell phone thing</text>
  <text start="491.93" dur="4.71">we could do smoke signals and that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="493.97" dur="6.21">way of doing it but oh yeah sorry</text>
  <text start="496.64" dur="5.13">let me make sure the mics closer so we</text>
  <text start="500.18" dur="3.63">could do smoke signals but better than</text>
  <text start="501.77" dur="5.58">that I think would be a cell phone</text>
  <text start="503.81" dur="6.87">company I have a plan there in place</text>
  <text start="507.35" dur="7.22">actually to offer a quality cell phone</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="6.39">service it&amp;#39;s actually a white label</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="5.5">software so I it&amp;#39;s pretty much plug and</text>
  <text start="517.07" dur="4.38">play but why would anybody switch to</text>
  <text start="520.07" dur="2.79">another cell phone service that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="521.45" dur="3.27">gonna be like an MV you know you&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="5.13">the same towers as like Sprint or</text>
  <text start="524.72" dur="4.56">Verizon or whatever and I&amp;#39;m not sure the</text>
  <text start="527.99" dur="3.26">price yet because I have to haven&amp;#39;t got</text>
  <text start="529.28" dur="5.1">that far but hopefully at a less price</text>
  <text start="531.25" dur="5.85">and that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;m hopefully gonna pay</text>
  <text start="534.38" dur="4.95">for the lawsuit I tried to do a</text>
  <text start="537.1" dur="4.96">non-profit for the lawsuit but then I</text>
  <text start="539.33" dur="6.72">was told by my advisors can&amp;#39;t do a</text>
  <text start="542.06" dur="5.64">non-profit for a lawsuit so instead of</text>
  <text start="546.05" dur="5.55">going that route we&amp;#39;re gonna start a</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="6.45">business to fund it and I&amp;#39;m expecting it</text>
  <text start="551.6" dur="5.04">to cost over $200,000 so hopefully some</text>
  <text start="554.15" dur="5.28">of you guys will join whitehat Wireless</text>
  <text start="556.64" dur="6.12">when it gets started to support the</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="5.7">lawsuit against big tech is my sound</text>
  <text start="562.76" dur="3.88">better Thank You Valerie I appreciate</text>
  <text start="565.13" dur="4.38">that I</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="7.49">I&amp;#39;m telling you guys if you could see</text>
  <text start="569.51" dur="4.62">the equipment side it&amp;#39;s a headache</text>
  <text start="578.92" dur="5.82">okay so we have some updates on kind of</text>
  <text start="583.149" dur="7.051">where that those things are really this</text>
  <text start="584.74" dur="6.779">week we are probably a few days away</text>
  <text start="590.2" dur="4.68">from launching the book of queuing on</text>
  <text start="591.519" dur="4.951">Comm which will be kind of that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="594.88" dur="3.54">for-profit thing because there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="596.47" dur="5.46">not a non-profit you know that they are</text>
  <text start="598.42" dur="5.01">a it&amp;#39;s a Defense Fund for general</text>
  <text start="601.93" dur="3">Flitton so it&amp;#39;s not like a non-profit as</text>
  <text start="603.43" dur="2.31">I understand it so it&amp;#39;s not a tax</text>
  <text start="604.93" dur="4.86">write-off or anything</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="5.789">so after expenses including taxes and</text>
  <text start="609.79" dur="4.799">such that business will be all towards</text>
  <text start="611.529" dur="4.92">that if I can I will also swing it so</text>
  <text start="614.589" dur="4.201">people can sign up as an affiliate and</text>
  <text start="616.449" dur="3.901">sell the book and get a percentage to</text>
  <text start="618.79" dur="3.659">help the Flynn&amp;#39;s which will be even</text>
  <text start="620.35" dur="4.109">cooler because then all the other</text>
  <text start="622.449" dur="5.671">influencers can can jump in on that too</text>
  <text start="624.459" dur="6.12">rather than going through Amazon for</text>
  <text start="628.12" dur="4.56">example and maybe we can even get</text>
  <text start="630.579" dur="5.76">something going where you could get who</text>
  <text start="632.68" dur="5.01">knows all of the signatures or at least</text>
  <text start="636.339" dur="4.081">most of them you know I&amp;#39;m not optimistic</text>
  <text start="637.69" dur="4.139">about a hundred percent but maybe we</text>
  <text start="640.42" dur="3.72">could do something like that as an extra</text>
  <text start="641.829" dur="5.281">feet and then donate that to the Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.14" dur="5.43">as well I&amp;#39;m just kind of thinking of</text>
  <text start="647.11" dur="4.26">ideas but you guys see kind of the way</text>
  <text start="649.57" dur="5.12">my thinking is going with with sort of</text>
  <text start="651.37" dur="6.029">capitalism for a cause as I&amp;#39;ve dubbed it</text>
  <text start="654.69" dur="6.37">start businesses to fund things to do</text>
  <text start="657.399" dur="5.13">good with where we go when we go and you</text>
  <text start="661.06" dur="4.08">know I&amp;#39;ve got a number of those things</text>
  <text start="662.529" dur="3.99">and I&amp;#39;ve got a number of existing</text>
  <text start="665.14" dur="2.73">Patriot owned businesses in the</text>
  <text start="666.519" dur="3.451">background that are very interested in</text>
  <text start="667.87" dur="4.409">this this idea of kind of coming</text>
  <text start="669.97" dur="5.16">together with alternative media that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="672.279" dur="5.67">very exciting for example NAG assurance</text>
  <text start="675.13" dur="5.34">calm on July 4th is launching you guys</text>
  <text start="677.949" dur="4.62">have heard about that one already we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="5.52">gonna sell health insurance and online</text>
  <text start="682.569" dur="6">pharmacy refills but we&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="685.99" dur="4.32">it to fund alternative media when we get</text>
  <text start="688.569" dur="3.541">the affiliate program going and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="690.31" dur="3.87">gonna use it to fund alternative health</text>
  <text start="692.11" dur="5.37">research things like the Brzezinski</text>
  <text start="694.18" dur="4.73">cancer cure things like whatever I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="697.48" dur="4.95">gonna call Andrew Wakefield and ask them</text>
  <text start="698.91" dur="6.34">honestly I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m not qualified</text>
  <text start="702.43" dur="4.74">to know where best to spend the</text>
  <text start="705.25" dur="3.63">potential I mean potentially a health</text>
  <text start="707.17" dur="3.21">insurance company with hundreds of</text>
  <text start="708.88" dur="3.57">thousands of Patriots signing up to it</text>
  <text start="710.38" dur="5.94">could be billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="712.45" dur="5.67">guys what could we do with that much</text>
  <text start="716.32" dur="5.04">money I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="718.12" dur="5.85">actually ask about nine I&amp;#39;m gonna set up</text>
  <text start="721.36" dur="4.17">kind of a Council of Advisors of nine</text>

  <text start="1136.22" dur="6.329">for the Nemo&amp;#39;s News Network itself</text>

  <text start="1142.549" dur="3.59">only have a limited number of tech staff</text>
  <text start="1144.109" dur="7.53">that can do so many websites at a time</text>
  <text start="1146.139" dur="8.02">so some have accused me of being a</text>
  <text start="1151.639" dur="3.72">little focused on funds lately because</text>
  <text start="1154.159" dur="2.7">I&amp;#39;ve been hiring so many people I&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1162.44" dur="3.239">take a step back and start up all these</text>
  <text start="1164.179" dur="3.57">businesses so that I can continue to</text>
  <text start="1165.679" dur="4.08">step forward with the media stuff</text>
  <text start="1167.749" dur="6.24">because the media work does not really</text>
  <text start="1169.759" dur="5.76">cover itself so obviously other people</text>
  <text start="1173.989" dur="2.851">you know there&amp;#39;s like mug club with</text>

  <text start="1252.82" dur="6.75">that would be good to see because they</text>
  <text start="1256.36" dur="5.49">would immediately stop now obviously</text>
  <text start="1259.57" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s a rights issue and you know do</text>

  <text start="1272.14" dur="5.49">to like respect people&amp;#39;s rights but at</text>

  <text start="1300.28" dur="8.07">in retaliation to make an example but</text>
  <text start="1304.89" dur="4.78">they stood down right so that&amp;#39;s what the</text>

  <text start="2830.479" dur="4.08">did is I have reported on the fact that</text>
  <text start="2832.039" dur="4.29">you called him aside and he did not like</text>
  <text start="2834.559" dur="3.3">that and when I put a book about that</text>
  <text start="2836.329" dur="3.571">about how he lied and all this other</text>
  <text start="2837.859" dur="4.62">stuff about me because he really he</text>
  <text start="2839.9" dur="5.279">reacted in a big way to that video he</text>
  <text start="2842.479" dur="4.29">really panicked and he said I put out a</text>
  <text start="2845.179" dur="3.751">video to kill him and I did this big</text>
  <text start="2846.769" dur="4.2">rebuttal and said I made him cry and</text>
  <text start="2848.93" dur="3.599">called me a bunch of stupid names and</text>
  <text start="2850.969" dur="5.431">stuff and you know didn&amp;#39;t make a lot of</text>
  <text start="2852.529" dur="6.51">sense but you know I put out a scathing</text>
  <text start="2856.4" dur="4.459">rebuttal in my usual like logical way</text>
  <text start="2859.039" dur="4.32">and being kind of a polite about it and</text>
  <text start="2860.859" dur="5.65">was actually kind of sad I used to</text>
  <text start="2863.359" dur="5.041">really respect him a lot for a long like</text>
  <text start="2866.509" dur="4.401">16 17 years and he quotes me on that</text>
  <text start="2868.4" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s funny and then more recently</text>
  <text start="2870.91" dur="4.419">because of the book I guess he&amp;#39;s pissed</text>
  <text start="2873.17" dur="4.159">off well maybe because of some other</text>
  <text start="2875.329" dur="5.64">stuff I don&amp;#39;t know yet</text>
  <text start="2877.329" dur="7.871">he did that live death threat to me on</text>
  <text start="2880.969" dur="5.55">on air on the 3rd of this month on his</text>
  <text start="2885.2" dur="4.5">4th hour while he was interviewing</text>
  <text start="2886.519" dur="4.56">captain Roy here in the audience what do</text>
  <text start="2889.7" dur="3.809">you think about that captain way and you</text>
  <text start="2891.079" dur="3.99">even called it - because you said yeah I</text>
  <text start="2893.509" dur="3.901">get what you say I understand</text>
  <text start="2895.069" dur="5.49">threats Alex and then later Alex</text>
  <text start="2897.41" dur="4.5">actually had that cut out of the of the</text>
  <text start="2900.559" dur="3.631">clip that went out so it was really</text>
  <text start="2901.91" dur="3.809">difficult to get the live clip where he</text>
  <text start="2904.19" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t cut it out so I actually put both</text>
  <text start="2905.719" dur="5.07">of them out together to show the context</text>
  <text start="2908.69" dur="5.339">of how he threatened to kill me and then</text>
  <text start="2910.789" dur="8.371">covered it up and Roy&amp;#39;s here - actually</text>
  <text start="2914.029" dur="8.401">he&amp;#39;s part of that wild month guys wild</text>
  <text start="2919.16" dur="7.02">month but what if he was right what if</text>
  <text start="2922.43" dur="9.96">he&amp;#39;s Mossad what if it&amp;#39;s not him saying</text>
  <text start="2926.18" dur="11.309">these things what if it&amp;#39;s them yeah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2932.39" dur="6.869">not scared of him the fact that it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2937.489" dur="4.29">public just shows that primarily I think</text>
  <text start="2939.259" dur="5.07">he&amp;#39;s afraid of me which surprised me at</text>
  <text start="2941.779" dur="4.861">first and then I realize well he might</text>
  <text start="2944.329" dur="5.43">actually be guilty Hugh is probably more</text>
  <text start="2946.64" dur="5.899">reliable than him and he obviously is</text>
  <text start="2949.759" dur="2.78">acting very guilty</text>
  <text start="2957.42" dur="6.31">I&amp;#39;m hoping that Corsi was the link and</text>
  <text start="2961.03" dur="4.14">Alex Jones was not the bad guy but you</text>
  <text start="2963.73" dur="3.96">know Hugh brought up free speech systems</text>
  <text start="2965.17" dur="4.59">right so this is something bigger than</text>
  <text start="2967.69" dur="4.92">just Corsa this is Alex himself and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2969.76" dur="5.13">tell you this on the backend Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="2972.61" dur="4.92">has not treated me well everyone in his</text>
  <text start="2974.89" dur="5.19">network not only as he made the the kind</text>
  <text start="2977.53" dur="5.4">of Lies and threats to me exactly but</text>
  <text start="2980.08" dur="3.93">everyone in his network assertive itch</text>
  <text start="2982.93" dur="5.28">wasn&amp;#39;t rude to me but I didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="2984.01" dur="5.7">bother to meet him and the Civic has</text>
  <text start="2988.21" dur="3.63">always been rude to me I politely</text>
  <text start="2989.71" dur="8.1">offered to debate him before his big</text>
  <text start="2991.84" dur="10.23">chat logs embarrassment and he doxxed me</text>
  <text start="2997.81" dur="5.79">instead so you know these the rest of</text>
  <text start="3002.07" dur="3.48">the people in the fake magaru many of</text>
  <text start="3003.6" dur="5.79">them i&amp;#39;ve identified are a part of that</text>
  <text start="3005.55" dur="6.36">network for example the uni rockin 0 our</text>
  <text start="3009.39" dur="5.88">lower level swamp troll types were</text>
  <text start="3011.91" dur="5.67">involved in some of the the chat log</text>
  <text start="3015.27" dur="4.65">debunking stuff with the microchip guy</text>
  <text start="3017.58" dur="5.52">this is for so bik&amp;#39;s evidence you know</text>
  <text start="3019.92" dur="4.68">these these I don&amp;#39;t know what you want</text>
  <text start="3023.1" dur="3.21">to call them you know to be polite so</text>
  <text start="3024.6" dur="3.9">rather than I just won&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="3026.31" dur="3.63">but you know not journalists these are</text>
  <text start="3028.5" dur="4.68">these are not necessarily people that</text>
  <text start="3029.94" dur="5.73">are professional in any way so this was</text>
  <text start="3033.18" dur="4.56">what he used to try to debunk you and on</text>
  <text start="3035.67" dur="4.32">this is what Oh a n and others tried to</text>
  <text start="3037.74" dur="5.52">it was weak you know it was really weak</text>
  <text start="3039.99" dur="5.67">and within a few minutes it was easy to</text>
  <text start="3043.26" dur="4.47">prove that actually any fifteen-year-old</text>
  <text start="3045.66" dur="4.47">kid could have faked that evidence can</text>
  <text start="3047.73" dur="6.09">you you sir are a liar right and I went</text>
  <text start="3050.13" dur="4.71">and I showed that I debated um and he</text>
  <text start="3053.82" dur="3.39">didn&amp;#39;t know it at the time but I</text>
  <text start="3054.84" dur="5.42">actually debated microchip the guy that</text>
  <text start="3057.21" dur="5.909">they said was the real Q and on on gap</text>
  <text start="3060.26" dur="4.09">all he could do was cuss you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3063.119" dur="2.311">not the kind of temperament that you</text>
  <text start="3064.35" dur="4.74">would expect with somebody behind</text>
  <text start="3065.43" dur="5.91">something like you and I so this is not</text>
  <text start="3069.09" dur="3.57">a strong seed of evidence but this is</text>
  <text start="3071.34" dur="3.33">the kind of things that they used to</text>
  <text start="3072.66" dur="3.29">debunk you why would they go through so</text>
  <text start="3074.67" dur="3.96">much trouble if they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3075.95" dur="5.65">propagandists why would they be so mean</text>
  <text start="3078.63" dur="6.3">to me if they weren&amp;#39;t actually you know</text>
  <text start="3081.6" dur="4.89">just malicious people so you know I</text>

  <text start="3106.68" dur="4.32">obvious wasn&amp;#39;t so what did you take from</text>
  <text start="3109.5" dur="3.15">that because I don&amp;#39;t want to I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3111" dur="3.09">want to just put my words on it</text>
  <text start="3112.65" dur="2.94">because you guys have a whole different</text>

  <text start="3139.89" dur="6.36">Kathy was looking into which was the the</text>
  <text start="3142.98" dur="7.47">note supposedly Mossad media complex or</text>
  <text start="3146.25" dur="5.94">whatever right so their media network he</text>
  <text start="3150.45" dur="3.99">alleged and I&amp;#39;m not saying anything</text>
  <text start="3152.19" dur="4.5">about anyone here I&amp;#39;m not you know</text>
  <text start="3154.44" dur="5.7">implying anything I don&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="3156.69" dur="5.07">sued but Kathy believed that and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3160.14" dur="3.03">know if he had evidence or not right I</text>
  <text start="3161.76" dur="3.39">haven&amp;#39;t had the full time to do this</text>
  <text start="3163.17" dur="6">full investigation Kathy believed that</text>
  <text start="3165.15" dur="7.35">Mossad gave Hoffman Podesta all of these</text>
  <text start="3169.17" dur="9.99">figures were linked for see Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="3172.5" dur="8.13">and he was killed within a short</text>
  <text start="3179.16" dur="5.24">timeframe of looking into these things</text>
  <text start="3180.63" dur="6.57">which cast a lot of suspicion on him now</text>
  <text start="3184.4" dur="4.39">Gabe Hoffman has contacted me and says</text>
  <text start="3187.2" dur="3.72">like you know look you put out a video</text>
  <text start="3188.79" dur="3.48">yes I understand this is what he was</text>
  <text start="3190.92" dur="3.36">saying but he didn&amp;#39;t have any evidence</text>
  <text start="3192.27" dur="4.35">and people are starting to threaten my</text>
  <text start="3194.28" dur="5.07">life you know because they thought that</text>
  <text start="3196.62" dur="4.52">I killed Kathy so I can understand both</text>
  <text start="3199.35" dur="4.47">sides about and not having the full</text>
  <text start="3201.14" dur="7.54">evidence that&amp;#39;s why all for dinner you</text>
  <text start="3203.82" dur="7.47">gave Hoffman but in that timeframe since</text>

  <text start="3242.67" dur="6.63">back end there are some weird things</text>
  <text start="3244.38" dur="7.38">around Cathy&amp;#39;s that some difference</text>
  <text start="3249.3" dur="4.11">differences of evidence differences of</text>

  <text start="3253.41" dur="4.68">stories going on which and I I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3256.8" dur="4.77">know I don&amp;#39;t have all the details so</text>
  <text start="3258.09" dur="5.61">that&amp;#39;s just what I&amp;#39;ve seen so far but I</text>
  <text start="3261.57" dur="4.62">know that when I touched the topic when</text>
  <text start="3263.7" dur="5.03">I stuck my toe in the topic all hell</text>
  <text start="3266.19" dur="2.54">came at me</text>

  <text start="3287.44" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s not a game learn to play the game</text>
  <text start="3290.17" dur="4.26">and that means something very important</text>
  <text start="3292.45" dur="4.2">because it&amp;#39;s not a game it&amp;#39;s thinking</text>
  <text start="3294.43" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s the game of Thrones for those who</text>

  <text start="3603.71" dur="7.29">great book and a great movie a bit too</text>
  <text start="3608.09" dur="5.46">fatalistic for me though I like where</text>
  <text start="3611" dur="4.38">the good guy can still win I believe</text>
  <text start="3613.55" dur="4.7">that we can win especially now I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3615.38" dur="2.87">always but I do now</text>
  <text start="3620.92" dur="5.68">so I funny since we got briefly on the</text>
  <text start="3624.53" dur="3.24">topic of video games it&amp;#39;s funny that</text>
  <text start="3626.6" dur="3.09">you&amp;#39;d think that&amp;#39;d be a waste of your</text>
  <text start="3627.77" dur="4.17">time but since I largely was interested</text>
  <text start="3629.69" dur="3.69">in strategy games I grew up playing a</text>
  <text start="3631.94" dur="3.06">game where you play if I felt like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3633.38" dur="3">like chess but instead of a few pieces</text>
  <text start="3635" dur="3.87">you get thousands of different pieces</text>
  <text start="3636.38" dur="4.29">and numerous opponents at the same time</text>
  <text start="3638.87" dur="3.6">and that kind of thing so that was what</text>
  <text start="3640.67" dur="3.27">I did for fun it helped me build up a</text>
  <text start="3642.47" dur="4.92">very strategic way of thinking about</text>
  <text start="3643.94" dur="4.47">these things which that coupled with you</text>
  <text start="3647.39" dur="3">know I was naturally interests in</text>
  <text start="3648.41" dur="3.87">business and investment stuff you know</text>
  <text start="3650.39" dur="3.69">this is a good place to be in terms of</text>
  <text start="3652.28" dur="3.21">effecting change in the world I mean</text>
  <text start="3654.08" dur="6.26">there&amp;#39;s a lot of capitalist can do right</text>
  <text start="3655.49" dur="4.85">now to help people by replacing bad guys</text>
  <text start="3662.11" dur="4.09">yeah I don&amp;#39;t like to speculate about the</text>
  <text start="3664.52" dur="4.05">health stuff people are saying about</text>
  <text start="3666.2" dur="3.96">Merkel has kuru or something they said</text>

  <text start="3671.18" dur="5.16">something&amp;#39;s going on unless we have more</text>
  <text start="3674.48" dur="3.63">evidence it&amp;#39;s enough to say that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3676.34" dur="3.78">very sick if you start exploiting</text>
  <text start="3678.11" dur="5.16">talking about kuru and stuff then that</text>
  <text start="3680.12" dur="6.03">goes down the like Satanists sacrificing</text>
  <text start="3683.27" dur="4.77">children pedo for stuff right that&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="3686.15" dur="3.33">much for normal people and that takes a</text>
  <text start="3688.04" dur="2.97">lot of context to understand that yeah</text>
  <text start="3689.48" dur="3.54">at the highest levels if they do some</text>
  <text start="3691.01" dur="3.33">pretty bad things to kids and there are</text>

  <text start="3739.19" dur="5.97">Mossad and I&amp;#39;m one of the bigger voices</text>
  <text start="3741.62" dur="6.05">doing it for example in the queue book</text>
  <text start="3745.16" dur="6.45">which was a best-seller I talked about</text>

  <text start="3756.2" dur="5.49">he he was he reacted to that video in a</text>
  <text start="3760.13" dur="3.48">big way and I wrote about that in my</text>
  <text start="3761.69" dur="4.23">book that chapters</text>
  <text start="3763.61" dur="7.25">titled how it made him cry you know the</text>
  <text start="3765.92" dur="4.94">day queuing and I made Alex Jones cry</text>
  <text start="3771.76" dur="3.88">and it&amp;#39;s absolutely true and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3774.23" dur="5.84">absolutely funny and it&amp;#39;s funny because</text>

  <text start="3815.33" dur="4.2">on POTUS and try to direct traffic</text>
  <text start="3816.92" dur="6.06">somewhere else this is a pattern I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3819.53" dur="5.82">seen with many within our own side</text>
  <text start="3822.98" dur="4.62">including Jack Pacific and discern of</text>
  <text start="3825.35" dur="4.02">itch including a right around midterms</text>
  <text start="3827.6" dur="3.72">by the way so they&amp;#39;re actually strategic</text>
  <text start="3829.37" dur="3.24">about it they&amp;#39;re your buddy until it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3831.32" dur="3.27">time to actually win and then suddenly</text>
  <text start="3832.61" dur="4.8">oh well like certain bitch said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3834.59" dur="5.34">feeling blue for midterms so these</text>

  <text start="3839.93" dur="4.44">be your friend they know our site is</text>
  <text start="3842.42" dur="3.24">right they know our arguments they</text>
  <text start="3844.37" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re deceptive and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3845.66" dur="3.93">so good at it because they know that</text>
  <text start="3847.61" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re in the right but they choose to</text>
  <text start="3849.59" dur="5.4">lie they choose to insert the narrative</text>
  <text start="3851.9" dur="5.82">wrong time and they choose to drop the</text>
  <text start="3854.99" dur="5.19">ball and and debunk things that were</text>
  <text start="3857.72" dur="4.619">never debunked for example pedo gate or</text>
  <text start="3860.18" dur="3.27">pizza gate as it was known I was never</text>

  <text start="3863.45" dur="3.56">apologized to it everybody swept it</text>
  <text start="3864.95" dur="6.859">under the rug</text>
  <text start="3867.01" dur="8.289">he has a pattern of this I see patterns</text>
  <text start="3871.809" dur="5.05">so I do find that there is interesting</text>

  <text start="3876.859" dur="2.881">comes to understanding the way that the</text>

  <text start="3884.119" dur="5.341">a number of books on the topic anyway so</text>
  <text start="3886.64" dur="5.25">basically the idea that you can embed</text>

  <text start="3900.71" dur="3.359">sort of stuff is always interested me</text>

  <text start="6036.66" dur="6.12">have more energy less energy focused on</text>
  <text start="6040.26" dur="4.32">defense more energy on repair assess</text>
  <text start="6042.78" dur="4.29">simple and the body does things like</text>
  <text start="6044.58" dur="4.44">that but only when you&amp;#39;re in a state of</text>

  <text start="6054.39" dur="3.66">nutrition in such all that stuff goes in</text>
  <text start="6055.91" dur="6.48">obviously not medical advice no health</text>
  <text start="6058.05" dur="4.34">claims careful with my wording and such</text>
  <text start="6062.9" dur="6.97">I don&amp;#39;t know of any research around c60</text>
  <text start="6066.66" dur="6.15">and parasites you could look into</text>
  <text start="6069.87" dur="5.58">diatomaceous earth which is deadly to</text>
  <text start="6072.81" dur="7.91">breathe but incredibly great to eat and</text>
  <text start="6075.45" dur="10.71">feed to animals for parasites my opinion</text>
  <text start="6080.72" dur="6.7">not medical advice cinnamon pam gibson</text>
  <text start="6086.16" dur="2.22">brings up cinnamon it can be very</text>
  <text start="6087.42" dur="2.19">powerful there&amp;#39;s a lot of great things</text>
  <text start="6088.38" dur="2.43">out there that if you get the right</text>
  <text start="6089.61" dur="3.24">quality and they&amp;#39;re fracture they can be</text>
  <text start="6090.81" dur="5.58">really powerful but I think cinnamon has</text>
  <text start="6092.85" dur="5.25">two types of cinnamon and I like certain</text>
  <text start="6096.39" dur="3.39">types of herbs have different strains I</text>
  <text start="6098.1" dur="5.49">get like wheat or whatever is one</text>
  <text start="6099.78" dur="5.04">example or kratom which is another</text>
  <text start="6103.59" dur="2.49">popular one people use to get off of</text>
  <text start="6104.82" dur="3.66">heroin</text>
  <text start="6106.08" dur="3.57">the kratom plant has different colors I</text>
  <text start="6108.48" dur="2.49">don&amp;#39;t know how it works exactly but</text>
  <text start="6109.65" dur="2.7">one&amp;#39;s for pain ones for energy or</text>
  <text start="6110.97" dur="3.54">something else there there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="6112.35" dur="3.51">different kinds of cinnamon and 1 is</text>
  <text start="6114.51" dur="3.12">actually unhealthy one is good for you</text>
  <text start="6115.86" dur="7.629">but of course usually you get the cheap</text>
  <text start="6117.63" dur="8.329">one so you know quality matters</text>

  <text start="6135.279" dur="5.32">PlayStation I don&amp;#39;t know I think it is a</text>
  <text start="6138.649" dur="3.54">question worth asking to see where</text>
  <text start="6140.599" dur="4.74">people stand on the issue of foreign</text>
  <text start="6142.189" dur="4.86">influence in general and I think as long</text>
  <text start="6145.339" dur="3.21">as you keep it respectful and polite and</text>
  <text start="6147.049" dur="3.54">focused on that I think it&amp;#39;s a fair</text>
  <text start="6148.549" dur="3.78">question to ask and it&amp;#39;s very suspicious</text>
  <text start="6150.589" dur="3.84">to want to shut it down</text>
  <text start="6152.329" dur="4.2">so there&amp;#39;s arguments on both sides about</text>
  <text start="6154.429" dur="4.47">some people take it too far they get</text>
  <text start="6156.529" dur="4.77">rude to get racist and some people are</text>
  <text start="6158.899" dur="6.92">actively covering for a pack who has too</text>
  <text start="6161.299" dur="9.72">much influence in our country you know</text>
  <text start="6165.819" dur="6.91">so the whole like the whole Zionist</text>
  <text start="6171.019" dur="4.95">Jewish thing is just like a bit of a</text>
  <text start="6172.729" dur="5.07">rabbit hole because it still puts people</text>
  <text start="6175.969" dur="5.82">in a group then that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="6177.799" dur="5.7">right you know there are different</text>
  <text start="6181.789" dur="3.6">factions within even Zionism there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6183.499" dur="3.72">like your soros faction of evildoers and</text>
  <text start="6185.389" dur="3.75">then there&amp;#39;s like people within israel</text>
  <text start="6187.219" dur="3.48">that maybe believe Israel has a right to</text>
  <text start="6189.139" dur="6.84">be there but don&amp;#39;t like those guys and</text>
  <text start="6190.699" dur="8.49">protest them so again it&amp;#39;s those in</text>
  <text start="6195.979" dur="6.51">power or evil but not everybody is evil</text>
  <text start="6199.189" dur="5.61">and not the whole group is evil so those</text>
  <text start="6202.489" dur="4.29">who say the Jews are evil is this it</text>
  <text start="6204.799" dur="3.8">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense there&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="6206.779" dur="5.1">some questions in the historical stuff</text>
  <text start="6208.599" dur="4.83">and we could get into all of that but it</text>
  <text start="6211.879" dur="4.53">doesn&amp;#39;t make sense every every</text>
  <text start="6213.429" dur="5.41">nationality has a past and as the quote</text>
