  <text start="3.449" dur="4.501">Mouse of Destiny Mouse calm and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="5.91" dur="6">gonna talk very briefly just kind of a</text>
  <text start="7.95" dur="5.22">public service slash inspiration I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="11.91" dur="4.019">want people to get too depressed about</text>
  <text start="13.17" dur="6.18">the the the midterm voting fraud</text>
  <text start="15.929" dur="5.85">situation that&amp;#39;s going on so obviously</text>
  <text start="19.35" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s a lot of reason to be angry</text>
  <text start="21.779" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s a lot of reason to think that</text>
  <text start="23.58" dur="6.09">there is outright voter fraud or rampant</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="4.591">across the u.s. right now to the extent</text>
  <text start="29.67" dur="4.5">that they may well try to steal or they</text>
  <text start="31.71" dur="3.14">are trying to steal the House and the</text>
  <text start="34.17" dur="4.56">Senate</text>
  <text start="34.85" dur="6.76">so you know people are thinking what if</text>
  <text start="38.73" dur="6.36">what if they succeed people are thinking</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="5.07">how we stop them in 2020 let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="45.09" dur="3.33">through the consequences here if they</text>
  <text start="46.68" dur="4.32">actually successfully take both House</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="5.549">and Senate they will impeach Trump if</text>
  <text start="51" dur="3.96">they successfully do so a couple things</text>
  <text start="53.969" dur="3.811">would have happened</text>
  <text start="54.96" dur="4.829">one q and on would have lied to us I</text>
  <text start="57.78" dur="4.79">don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the case because he</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="5.16">told us that the elections were safe to</text>
  <text start="62.57" dur="4.57">Trump would have had to have been very</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="4.771">stupid and I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the case</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="3.99">either because obviously we all knew I</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="2.939">mean we&amp;#39;ve seen the voter fraud in the</text>
  <text start="71.13" dur="4.29">last two years we&amp;#39;ve seen it before that</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="5.941">extensively and and Trump has proven</text>
  <text start="75.42" dur="5.75">himself to be a brilliant high IQ genius</text>
  <text start="78.6" dur="5.4">and I&amp;#39;m talking at the level of like 160</text>
  <text start="81.17" dur="3.91">Einstein just look at the the moves and</text>
  <text start="84" dur="2.43">countermoves if you&amp;#39;ve been paying</text>
  <text start="85.08" dur="5.01">attention last couple years you know</text>
  <text start="86.43" dur="5.07">that and you guys are welcome to to list</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="5.459">some of your favorite examples in the</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="4.939">comments below but obviously he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="95.549" dur="3.481">stupid</text>
  <text start="96.439" dur="3.851">obviously he knew this was coming and</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="4.56">obviously he knew the risk that it</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="4.859">presented now in that situation it would</text>
  <text start="103.59" dur="4.23">have been dumb not to prepare for it</text>
  <text start="105.149" dur="5.4">right so obviously he&amp;#39;s prepared for it</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="4.409">now what does prepared mean well you</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="3.151">could you could block it from happening</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="3.631">that&amp;#39;s what they did in the 2016</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="5.25">election yeah you could stop it</text>
  <text start="115.86" dur="4.619">or you could expose it by giving them</text>
  <text start="118.95" dur="5.129">enough rope to hang themselves that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="6.361">the more Machiavellian slash art of war</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="6.681">kind of approach right and how would you</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="5.61">do that let them cheat let them do it</text>
  <text start="130.76" dur="4.38">monitor</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="3.84">you know Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="135.14" dur="3.31">okay</text>
  <text start="136.29" dur="5.79">general Kelly things like this that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="7.17">happening I covered recently how general</text>
  <text start="142.08" dur="6.18">Kelly is going he&amp;#39;s affirming that the</text>
  <text start="145.62" dur="4.229">the government has the right to take</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="4.35">over critical infrastructure I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="149.849" dur="5.911">remember the name of the law but this is</text>
  <text start="152.61" dur="6.12">an older law from either Obama era or</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="4.02">even before that and they do have the</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="3">ability and they do have the authority</text>
  <text start="159.78" dur="3.569">to do that so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="161.73" dur="3.869">investigating these things and all this</text>
  <text start="163.349" dur="3.931">all these voting everything from the</text>
  <text start="165.599" dur="5.64">buildings that they use to the process</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="5.73">itself is critical infrastructure so of</text>
  <text start="171.239" dur="4.021">course we&amp;#39;re watching we see everything</text>
  <text start="173.01" dur="5.4">the good guys have the NSA they have the</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="5.789">DHS they&amp;#39;re not going to get away with</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="6.48">it that&amp;#39;s my view that&amp;#39;s my belief if</text>
  <text start="181.049" dur="5.461">they do I I can see a very real</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="3.45">possibility that this country would go</text>
  <text start="186.51" dur="3.479">to Civil War and that&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="188.34" dur="3.09">that I expect to happen at all that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="4.86">not something that I think will happen</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="6.179">just a remote possibility if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="194.849" dur="5.521">allowed to cheat and successfully pull</text>
  <text start="197.609" dur="4.38">it off now also another benefit of</text>
  <text start="200.37" dur="4.08">allowing them enough rope to hang</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="4.62">themselves in this situation they&amp;#39;ve if</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ve revealed everything they&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="206.609" dur="3.571">out with we&amp;#39;re gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna do this</text>
  <text start="208.65" dur="2.85">this and this we&amp;#39;re coming after you</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="3.51">Trump they&amp;#39;re getting cocky they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="211.5" dur="4.049">getting braggadocious right there there</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="4.29">they are saying that they&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="215.549" dur="3.991">after guns they&amp;#39;re gonna reopen all of</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="3.39">these investigations are going after</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="3.169">Trump&amp;#39;s taxes they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="4.199">doing all of these different things</text>
  <text start="222.709" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re going full crazy all</text>
  <text start="225.569" dur="4.861">right and they&amp;#39;ve really shown their</text>
  <text start="228.389" dur="3.991">hand okay prematurely</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="4.139">they&amp;#39;re not even in office yet okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="3.57">not even these new people are not even</text>
  <text start="234.569" dur="4.461">in office until January</text>
  <text start="235.95" dur="6.45">so they&amp;#39;ve prematurely shown their hand</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="5.53">they have forgotten that we have the</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="3.929">Supreme Court we could do these things</text>
  <text start="244.56" dur="3.959">and anything that happens it will go to</text>
  <text start="246.329" dur="4.551">the Supreme Court like if we round up</text>
  <text start="248.519" dur="4.951">some of these these voter fraud</text>
  <text start="250.88" dur="4.479">candidates or we round up people that</text>
  <text start="253.47" dur="5.1">were involved in voter fraud they get</text>
  <text start="255.359" dur="6">arrested and then it goes off to a</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="4.86">special election and then if they cheat</text>
  <text start="261.359" dur="4.941">again what we do it again I mean we can</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="4.37">just keep doing that my my sadness here</text>
  <text start="266.3" dur="2.85">that we can&amp;#39;t make people like Brenda</text>
  <text start="267.8" dur="4.38">Snipes pay for the cost of these</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="4.44">recounts but or these special elections</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="3.239">because we shouldn&amp;#39;t be on the hook for</text>
  <text start="273.59" dur="4.62">the the fraud that they&amp;#39;re committing</text>
  <text start="275.419" dur="5.37">but I think it&amp;#39;s money well invested so</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="4.799">don&amp;#39;t get discouraged don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="280.789" dur="4.38">depressed yet this game is far from over</text>
  <text start="283.009" dur="4.831">I don&amp;#39;t know how long it&amp;#39;s gonna take I</text>
  <text start="285.169" dur="6.21">imagine they&amp;#39;re going to let it play out</text>
  <text start="287.84" dur="7.02">until the time to do maximum damage to</text>
  <text start="291.379" dur="5.97">the to the to the left so it could go</text>
  <text start="294.86" dur="5.339">all the way up to right before January</text>
  <text start="297.349" dur="5.25">you know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know but I do</text>
  <text start="300.199" dur="5.821">know that the passion is on it now the</text>
  <text start="302.599" dur="5.1">energy is on it now and we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="4.17">happens I mean I think they would need</text>
  <text start="307.699" dur="4.981">time for special elections and hopefully</text>
  <text start="310.19" dur="4.56">they would choose to do that in 2018 but</text>
  <text start="312.68" dur="3.419">also remember that Q has told us and if</text>
  <text start="314.75" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;ve been following Q you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.099" dur="3.481">the most credible thing out there the</text>
  <text start="318.08" dur="4.739">most reliable thing out there in terms</text>
  <text start="319.58" dur="7.04">of getting it right oftentimes a year in</text>
  <text start="322.819" dur="5.91">advance except perhaps Trump himself</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="3.22">okay and obviously they&amp;#39;re on the same</text>
  <text start="328.729" dur="3.3">team they&amp;#39;re working very closely</text>
  <text start="329.84" dur="4.049">together there&amp;#39;s every bit of evidence</text>
  <text start="332.029" dur="4.081">to suggest that hundreds of points of</text>
  <text start="333.889" dur="4.441">evidence to suggest that and the people</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="4.739">that think it&amp;#39;s a cult think it&amp;#39;s a fake</text>
  <text start="338.33" dur="4.86">or or bash it because it&amp;#39;s an anonymous</text>
  <text start="340.849" dur="3.981">person you know I&amp;#39;ve mentioned our</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="5.819">history is full of anonymous people</text>
  <text start="344.83" dur="6.07">standing up for freedom and most of our</text>
  <text start="349.009" dur="4.02">founding fathers were anonymous at some</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="4.109">point because you could get hurt or</text>
  <text start="353.029" dur="3.75">attacked or or killed in those days they</text>
  <text start="355.009" dur="4.47">would round you up if you were speaking</text>
  <text start="356.779" dur="4.86">against the crown and that&amp;#39;s kind of the</text>
  <text start="359.479" dur="4.111">situation we&amp;#39;re in today except where</text>
  <text start="361.639" dur="4.321">it&amp;#39;s not a crown it&amp;#39;s a culture and if</text>
  <text start="363.59" dur="4.979">you speak against the the dominant</text>
  <text start="365.96" dur="4.079">culture which is the at least that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.569" dur="3.241">what they&amp;#39;re pushing is the dominant</text>
  <text start="370.039" dur="4.41">culture and I would say it&amp;#39;s been at</text>
  <text start="371.81" dur="4.319">least ascendant for quite a while you</text>
  <text start="374.449" dur="3.75">know they&amp;#39;ve got the education system</text>
  <text start="376.129" dur="4.891">the the entertainment system they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="378.199" dur="5.011">the most of the government they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="381.02" dur="4.29">most people out there in positions of</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="3.359">power because they&amp;#39;ve infiltrated and</text>
  <text start="385.31" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;ve taken it and then they&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>
  <text start="386.569" dur="3.361">their cronies in there and I hope that</text>
  <text start="388.46" dur="3.449">if anyone out there has any sort of</text>
  <text start="389.93" dur="3.78">position of power that you were very</text>
  <text start="391.909" dur="4.23">careful about giving any of that power</text>
  <text start="393.71" dur="5.71">to the left I actually would very much</text>
  <text start="396.139" dur="4.781">encourage conservatives to seek power</text>
  <text start="399.42" dur="3.09">try not to let it corrupt you because I</text>
  <text start="400.92" dur="3.87">know that&amp;#39;s the process and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.51" dur="3.78">always what happens but then get other</text>
  <text start="404.79" dur="3.06">conservatives and hire other</text>
  <text start="406.29" dur="3.69">conservatives that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="407.85" dur="4.2">absolutely discriminate against the left</text>
  <text start="409.98" dur="4.38">because their ideas need to be</text>
  <text start="412.05" dur="4.2">discriminated against I know that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="414.36" dur="3.66">going to be a popular topic for some who</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="3.39">think that discrimination is always evil</text>
  <text start="418.02" dur="2.94">but we discriminate against murderers we</text>
  <text start="419.64" dur="3.57">discriminate against rapists we</text>
  <text start="420.96" dur="4.68">discriminate against bad people and</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="4.02">communism and this sort of Marxist</text>
  <text start="425.64" dur="3.06">infiltration is no different</text>
  <text start="427.23" dur="4.41">we should discriminate against it</text>
  <text start="428.7" dur="4.53">because good people need to judge bad</text>
  <text start="431.64" dur="4.05">people and if that&amp;#39;s not a popular thing</text>
  <text start="433.23" dur="4.32">either you know let me who was out</text>
  <text start="435.69" dur="3.81">without sin cast the first stone and</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="4.56">there there is there is definitely</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="4.71">wisdom in that right it teaches a more</text>
  <text start="442.11" dur="4.26">humble approach but at some point</text>
  <text start="444.21" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s also the fact that evil only</text>
  <text start="446.37" dur="4.98">wins when good people do nothing and if</text>
  <text start="449.07" dur="4.61">good people are just not judging bad</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="4.62">people what&amp;#39;s gonna happen to the world</text>
  <text start="453.68" dur="5.29">we need to judge we need to at least</text>
  <text start="455.97" dur="5.91">make critical judgments as to what</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="4.53">future we want in the world and I think</text>
  <text start="461.88" dur="5.91">that this midterm situation is going to</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="6.15">be a great example of just how brilliant</text>
  <text start="467.79" dur="3.78">Trump is I think is gonna be the</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="3.48">greatest election fraud sting in history</text>
  <text start="471.57" dur="3.86">we&amp;#39;ve already seen a few arrests</text>
  <text start="473.13" dur="5.58">building up to this that&amp;#39;s not typical</text>
  <text start="475.43" dur="4.81">and now we&amp;#39;re seeing Florida and Broward</text>
  <text start="478.71" dur="4.05">County situation already under</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="4.83">investigation hopefully it will extend</text>
  <text start="482.76" dur="4.71">into the sheriff&amp;#39;s office there as well</text>
  <text start="485.07" dur="4.32">because that county really needs to be</text>
  <text start="487.47" dur="4.11">cleaned I think it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="489.39" dur="5.64">to compete with Washington DC for most</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="6.06">corrupt but we&amp;#39;ll see you know I I&amp;#39;m the</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="5.4">kind of person I&amp;#39;ve never wanted power</text>
  <text start="497.64" dur="4.41">right I don&amp;#39;t want power I know that it</text>
  <text start="500.43" dur="3.66">would tempt me to do bad things I know</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="3.69">that it would tempt me there&amp;#39;s a thing</text>
  <text start="504.09" dur="2.58">out there called the Lucifer effect I</text>
  <text start="505.74" dur="2.43">don&amp;#39;t know if you guys have heard of it</text>
  <text start="506.67" dur="4.95">you don&amp;#39;t have to be religious to accept</text>
  <text start="508.17" dur="5.97">it whatever the the idea around the</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="4.26">Lucifer effect and I am agnostic at the</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="3.72">end of the day I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="515.88" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t know a lot of things about that</text>
  <text start="517.86" dur="5.73">side of the world I&amp;#39;m very curious about</text>
  <text start="519.93" dur="6.03">things on the other hand you know I grew</text>
  <text start="523.59" dur="5.4">up thinking religion was the the problem</text>
  <text start="525.96" dur="4.68">with all the you know the source of</text>
  <text start="528.99" dur="3.84">corruption in the world it was like the</text>
  <text start="530.64" dur="3.6">big problem I mean Dark Ages and</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="4.65">a lot of bad stuff in religion history</text>
