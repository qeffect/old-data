  <text start="124.64" dur="4.56">you don&amp;#39;t think it was suicide I think</text>
  <text start="126.68" dur="5.339">that the evidence points toward homicide</text>
  <text start="129.2" dur="4.95">rather than suicide I because there are</text>
  <text start="132.019" dur="5.161">multiple three fractures in the hyoid</text>
  <text start="134.15" dur="7.14">bone the thyroid cartilage that are very</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="7.11">unusual for suicide and more indicative</text>
  <text start="141.29" dur="5.16">of strangulation homicidal strangulation</text>
  <text start="144.29" dur="5.19">let&amp;#39;s take a look at what the medical</text>
  <text start="146.45" dur="5.4">examiner stated after a careful review</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="4.89">of all the investigative information</text>

  <text start="162.349" dur="4.351">fatal injuries are consistent with</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="4.14">homicide more consistent with homicide</text>
  <text start="166.7" dur="5.31">and in fact at the time of the autopsy</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="4.739">the doctor doing the autopsy wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.01" dur="3.99">didn&amp;#39;t think it was enough information</text>
  <text start="173.659" dur="4.41">to say suicide so she put it well</text>
  <text start="176" dur="4.079">pending for the study and then for</text>
  <text start="178.069" dur="3.361">summary and they won&amp;#39;t know the family</text>
  <text start="180.079" dur="2.821">was to know why was it change from</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="3.3">pending for the study to homicide</text>
  <text start="182.9" dur="5.069">afterwards so that here that&amp;#39;s a famed</text>

  <text start="235.04" dur="4.559">jump off of a very short bunk bed it</text>
  <text start="237.949" dur="4.5">just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense and not even a</text>
