  <text start="8.68" dur="17.7">you</text>
  <text start="9.65" dur="19.679">[Music]</text>
  <text start="26.38" dur="5.739">welcome back my friends we are going to</text>
  <text start="29.329" dur="5.611">discuss two important things</text>
  <text start="32.119" dur="6.751">Trump related now the first of these</text>
  <text start="34.94" dur="7.399">things is it seems that Trump is going</text>
  <text start="38.87" dur="8.07">right along with the gun grabber base</text>
  <text start="42.339" dur="7.031">the left the Democrats the the the deep</text>
  <text start="46.94" dur="6.869">state people that want to get rid of gun</text>
  <text start="49.37" dur="9.78">rights let me let me qualify that and</text>
  <text start="53.809" dur="7.081">explain so we all know Steve Scalise the</text>
  <text start="59.15" dur="5.909">the Republican lawmaker that was shot</text>
  <text start="60.89" dur="7.35">and survived he suggested the</text>
  <text start="65.059" dur="11.731">reciprocity law which would require all</text>
  <text start="68.24" dur="10.199">states to to allow concealed carry Trump</text>
  <text start="76.79" dur="3.149">kind of rejected that and he was polite</text>
  <text start="78.439" dur="3.72">about it but he sort of rejected that he</text>
  <text start="79.939" dur="4.231">said that&amp;#39;s not gonna pass and this bill</text>
  <text start="82.159" dur="4.561">we should do that separately another</text>
  <text start="84.17" dur="6.619">time I don&amp;#39;t want that one but he did</text>
  <text start="86.72" dur="6.66">allow this Democrats gun control bill</text>
  <text start="90.789" dur="3.46">and he said that would be like a base we</text>
  <text start="93.38" dur="5.159">can build on that</text>
  <text start="94.249" dur="5.701">and it it&amp;#39;s basically code for I mean it</text>
  <text start="98.539" dur="3.091">talks about strengthening the reporting</text>
  <text start="99.95" dur="4.409">of information to background check</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="4.86">system requires background checks on all</text>
  <text start="104.359" dur="6.03">commercial sells but that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="106.49" dur="9.36">code for private gun sale background</text>
  <text start="110.389" dur="7.141">checks all right this is one of those</text>
  <text start="115.85" dur="4.259">big things that people have been</text>
  <text start="117.53" dur="5.31">resisting in the past you know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="120.109" dur="7.08">already tried this bill basically after</text>
  <text start="122.84" dur="12">Sandy Hook and it was rejected April</text>
  <text start="127.189" dur="11.191">17th of 2013 so this is a move backwards</text>
  <text start="134.84" dur="5.869">for us if Trump is supporting this then</text>
  <text start="138.38" dur="4.939">it&amp;#39;s probably gonna get passed folks and</text>
  <text start="140.709" dur="5.441">we know the left will be all for it and</text>
  <text start="143.319" dur="5.201">a lot of the right will do it just</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="5.16">because it&amp;#39;s Trump and I think this is a</text>
  <text start="148.52" dur="4.8">mistake we should not support things</text>
  <text start="151.31" dur="3.33">just because it comes from Trump we</text>
  <text start="153.32" dur="3.74">should support the things that we agree</text>
  <text start="154.64" dur="5.03">with because Trump agrees with them</text>
  <text start="157.06" dur="5.97">remember that he is he is not Jesus</text>
  <text start="159.67" dur="7.02">folks now this is this is scary because</text>
  <text start="163.03" dur="6.06">Trump is kind of kind of bowing his head</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="4.38">a little bit to the gun grabbers you</text>
  <text start="169.09" dur="5.37">know he&amp;#39;s already talked about bump</text>
  <text start="171.07" dur="4.98">stocks and I don&amp;#39;t really care about</text>
  <text start="174.46" dur="3.66">bump stocks but they have no right to</text>
  <text start="176.05" dur="3.72">take them from us all right they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="2.97">have a right to take a tank from us I</text>
  <text start="179.77" dur="5.04">mean we have to have the same mill at</text>
  <text start="181.09" dur="6.12">the same level of weaponry and power and</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="4.47">firepower as the military has in order</text>
  <text start="187.21" dur="4.83">to resist the government that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="189.28" dur="5.16">whole point of the Second Amendment not</text>
  <text start="192.04" dur="5.09">for hunting and not even really just for</text>
  <text start="194.44" dur="7.53">protection and self-defense it was</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="9.22">designed to counter corruption and abuse</text>
  <text start="201.97" dur="5.79">of power and in government anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="206.35" dur="2.4">that&amp;#39;s very concerning I wanted to</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="2.34">mention it</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="3.65">we should definitely pay attention to</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="4.71">how that develops now another thing</text>
  <text start="212.4" dur="4.42">facebook is basically shadow banning</text>
  <text start="214.81" dur="3.42">Trump this is this is I was gonna do a</text>
  <text start="216.82" dur="5.01">video just for this and then I added the</text>
  <text start="218.23" dur="9.15">gun thing in you can see by this chart</text>
  <text start="221.83" dur="9.54">right here that his engagement on</text>
  <text start="227.38" dur="6">Facebook is actually down 45% now you</text>
  <text start="231.37" dur="3.9">know we all know him for Twitter but</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="4.62">basically because of social media in his</text>
  <text start="235.27" dur="6.15">mastery of it he&amp;#39;s been able to reach</text>
  <text start="238" dur="5.489">the people that is going to be more and</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="4.17">more difficult when they start changing</text>
  <text start="243.489" dur="4.411">the algorithms and toying with things</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="6">and messing with the code on the back</text>
  <text start="247.9" dur="5.51">end so that we unbeknownst to us are</text>
  <text start="251.59" dur="4.07">having a harder time getting to Trump</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="4.9">okay</text>
  <text start="255.66" dur="4.69">this is just Facebook but I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re all gonna be working on it okay</text>
  <text start="260.35" dur="5.069">we&amp;#39;ve already seen YouTube censoring in</text>
  <text start="262.15" dur="4.68">Mass and then a--basically trying to</text>
  <text start="265.419" dur="4.621">blame it on their new employees now</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="8.42">because they&amp;#39;re backtracking but this is</text>
  <text start="270.04" dur="7.62">not good so this is the response</text>
  <text start="275.25" dur="4.9">remember the other day that Q had told</text>
  <text start="277.66" dur="3.99">us that at Jack was kind of scared</text>
  <text start="280.15" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s Jack Dorsey of Twitter he was</text>
  <text start="281.65" dur="4.2">having trouble sleeping he was nervous</text>
  <text start="283.24" dur="5.31">he thought he was protected well guess</text>
  <text start="285.85" dur="3.99">what now since that happened we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="288.55" dur="3.149">the launch of massive</text>
  <text start="289.84" dur="5.9">censorship on YouTube bans of the</text>
  <text start="291.699" dur="8.431">conservative youtubers we have seen many</text>
  <text start="295.74" dur="6.91">people on Twitter being suspended or or</text>
  <text start="300.13" dur="4.59">outright closed many of the messages in</text>
  <text start="302.65" dur="3.78">my own Twitter inbox have little locks</text>
  <text start="304.72" dur="3.68">on them now I can&amp;#39;t even reply to those</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="5.16">people anymore because they&amp;#39;re banned</text>
  <text start="308.4" dur="5.26">people lost many of their followers on</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="4.799">Twitter you know and youtube influencers</text>
  <text start="313.66" dur="5.13">so stuffs going on on all three</text>
  <text start="316.389" dur="4.951">platforms and it all happens since that</text>
  <text start="318.79" dur="5.31">Q post I think they&amp;#39;re related because</text>
  <text start="321.34" dur="5.67">we know at least Jack was scared and</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="5.55">we&amp;#39;ve also seen Zuckerberg selling</text>
  <text start="327.01" dur="7.59">millions and millions of dollars worth</text>
  <text start="329.65" dur="7.26">of Facebook shares so we have panic</text>

  <text start="336.91" dur="3.63">mentioned that Jack was scared what is</text>
  <text start="339.04" dur="3.51">going on behind the scenes</text>
