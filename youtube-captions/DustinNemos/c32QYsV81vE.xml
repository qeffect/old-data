  <text start="241.019" dur="6.3">changing topics with these events for</text>
  <text start="245.219" dur="4.08">lack of well since I can&amp;#39;t say the real</text>
  <text start="247.319" dur="3.75">word I want to say they might ban me but</text>
  <text start="249.299" dur="3.66">these events that they&amp;#39;re pulling off</text>
  <text start="251.069" dur="3.12">even if they can&amp;#39;t even if they can</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="3.87">change the narrative we&amp;#39;re still ahead</text>
  <text start="254.189" dur="6.48">in midterms even even in California like</text>
  <text start="256.829" dur="8.84">we&amp;#39;re neck-and-neck 2% away so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="5">pretty huge just because of the location</text>
  <text start="268.56" dur="4.199">there are Diane brings up the Hatch Act</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="4.8">there are people who are saying that cue</text>
  <text start="272.759" dur="5.431">is kind of gagged and Trump can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="275.88" dur="7.61">release the fisa because of the Hatch</text>
  <text start="278.19" dur="5.3">Act until after the midterms</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="5.65">yeah</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="7.88">voting is is a big deal as I do think it</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="6.63">will be fair according to Bill Mitchell</text>
  <text start="304" dur="4.96">millennial turnout at least in Florida</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="4.17">was like four point four percent so the</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="3.3">Democrat Party are just they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.79" dur="7.7">decimated they don&amp;#39;t even want to show</text>
  <text start="312.26" dur="6.23">up to vote this is a good trend to see</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s a weird question Barry</text>
  <text start="330.69" dur="6.55">yeah the the Democrat voter fraud ring</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="8.359">uncovered in Texas was paid for by the</text>
  <text start="337.24" dur="4.549">mcwrap that was interesting</text>
  <text start="348.8" dur="5.8">it&amp;#39;s probably time to switch over to all</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="5.45">caps for the questions because that will</text>
  <text start="354.6" dur="4.5">help me out but somebody was saying</text>
  <text start="356.54" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t get me wrong I support Trump but</text>
  <text start="359.1" dur="4.98">what if he&amp;#39;s just a deep state puppet</text>
  <text start="361.25" dur="6.46">that that&amp;#39;s kind of a more of a</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="5.04">philosophical answer because logically</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="4.38">speaking everything know do everything</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="5.07">that they&amp;#39;re doing kind of breaks down</text>
  <text start="372.09" dur="3.3">the paradigm of the globalist deep State</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="3.84">like everything they&amp;#39;ve been working on</text>
  <text start="375.39" dur="4.89">the whole you know communist belief</text>
  <text start="378.03" dur="5.63">system is being damaged the whole belief</text>
  <text start="380.28" dur="4.92">in government is being damaged</text>
  <text start="383.66" dur="3.07">Christianity is kind of being</text>
  <text start="385.2" dur="4.98">strengthened by this move whereas they</text>
  <text start="386.73" dur="5.79">were really attacking it freedoms are</text>
  <text start="390.18" dur="4.56">being expanded and regulations cut back</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="5.61">taxes cut back if it was all some big</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="6.33">elaborate hoax why are they focused on</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="5.7">rounding up pedophiles why is that the</text>
  <text start="401.07" dur="5.55">old media all over that issue it really</text>
  <text start="403.83" dur="4.83">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like any of that would make</text>
  <text start="406.62" dur="5.52">sense so they would have just let</text>
  <text start="408.66" dur="5.7">Hillary won that would be my my argument</text>
  <text start="412.14" dur="5.34">there it just doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="414.36" dur="5.64">simplistic explanation you know Occam&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.48" dur="5">razor so I really don&amp;#39;t think Trump is</text>
  <text start="420" dur="2.48">deep state</text>
  <text start="426.45" dur="6.94">yes Jim Gray we are seeing a red wave</text>
  <text start="430.8" dur="6.78">most of the people who change parties</text>
  <text start="433.39" dur="8.58">are changing to Republican not from</text>
  <text start="437.58" dur="7.18">we&amp;#39;re winning in almost every Prevot</text>
  <text start="441.97" dur="4.86">ting situation across the board with a</text>
  <text start="444.76" dur="3.98">very few exceptions including California</text>
  <text start="446.83" dur="4.73">where we&amp;#39;re like 2 percent behind</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="5.53">basically you know a tie at this point</text>
  <text start="451.56" dur="3.19">and that&amp;#39;s like I said California that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.27" dur="3.54">huge</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="5.31">so there&amp;#39;s a lot of progress being made</text>
  <text start="457.81" dur="5.07">there voters are not even turning out if</text>
  <text start="460.06" dur="7.44">you can go off of you know one state as</text>
  <text start="462.88" dur="6.45">an example Florida it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="467.5" dur="2.22">killing we&amp;#39;re just kicking by it right</text>
  <text start="469.33" dur="3.42">now</text>
  <text start="469.72" dur="11.64">of course go vote of course go vote but</text>
  <text start="472.75" dur="11.25">yeah we&amp;#39;re kicking mine right now yes</text>
  <text start="481.36" dur="5.07">penny you bring up a good point he is</text>
  <text start="484" dur="4.2">he&amp;#39;s working for free and he has not</text>
  <text start="486.43" dur="5.31">only spent a tremendous amount of his</text>
  <text start="488.2" dur="5.13">own money you know Julian Assange and</text>
  <text start="491.74" dur="3.87">this is an old number had said he&amp;#39;d lost</text>
  <text start="493.33" dur="4.1">a quarter of his of his wealth that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="5.34">massive</text>
  <text start="497.43" dur="6.55">but he he&amp;#39;s also passed tax cuts that</text>
  <text start="500.95" dur="6">don&amp;#39;t favor the very wealthy and in fact</text>
  <text start="503.98" dur="5.79">would cost him money because it took</text>
  <text start="506.95" dur="6.779">away a lot of the very very very wealthy</text>
  <text start="509.77" dur="6.39">tax breaks for the housing so you know</text>
  <text start="513.729" dur="5.821">if the tax if your property tax was over</text>
  <text start="516.16" dur="4.53">10,000 you actually have to I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="519.55" dur="3.78">remember the exact details but it was</text>
  <text start="520.69" dur="6.21">something that like the property taxes</text>
  <text start="523.33" dur="5.49">being more than 10,000 per house or</text>
  <text start="526.9" dur="5.85">something I don&amp;#39;t remember I can&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="528.82" dur="4.92">remember that one Nancy Pelosi wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="2.61">happy about it though because she had</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="4.26">multiple of those houses where they had</text>
  <text start="535.36" dur="5.93">massive property taxes I think they got</text>
  <text start="538" dur="6.63">like a reduction or something all on</text>
  <text start="541.29" dur="4.93">from a very wealthy perspective and that</text>
  <text start="544.63" dur="4.7">would only affect the people who had the</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="6.68">mansions and stuff basically</text>
  <text start="549.33" dur="3.57">yep it&amp;#39;s huge birthday</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="7.75">yeah yeah I knew was 10,000 I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="564.029" dur="4.861">remember the exact details of how that</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="11.64">affected the tax folks but that ended up</text>
  <text start="568.89" dur="12.21">costing him money I saw that meme</text>
  <text start="577.26" dur="7.11">Richard crota yeah that&amp;#39;s the mysterious</text>
  <text start="581.1" dur="6.23">package that I&amp;#39;m curious about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.37" dur="2.96">going on with that story</text>
  <text start="594.92" dur="6.13">Peter Peter Pan says he is drowning in a</text>
  <text start="598.29" dur="4.29">blue neighborhood the Demme sent letters</text>
  <text start="601.05" dur="3.93">to all of his neighbors letting them</text>
  <text start="602.58" dur="5.13">know that he is not with them in</text>
  <text start="604.98" dur="4.29">politics well if they already know I</text>
  <text start="607.71" dur="2.91">mean that that sounds like it could be</text>
  <text start="609.27" dur="3">dangerous but you may as well put out</text>
  <text start="610.62" dur="4.77">your Trump signs and rig them up to an</text>
  <text start="612.27" dur="6.42">electric wire now because that way if</text>
  <text start="615.39" dur="6.23">they grab them they&amp;#39;ll get shocked maze</text>
  <text start="618.69" dur="2.93">will be proud about it</text>
  <text start="622.82" dur="11.25">we&amp;#39;re awfully way too nice to those</text>
  <text start="625.47" dur="10.94">people because we just want to you know</text>
  <text start="634.07" dur="6.63">keep the peace and not rock the boat</text>
  <text start="636.41" dur="4.29">that kind of works against us sometimes</text>
  <text start="644.12" dur="3.48">so Justin you&amp;#39;re the second person today</text>
  <text start="646.189" dur="2.64">to tell me that the Texas voting</text>
  <text start="647.6" dur="4.669">machines are changing people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="648.829" dur="7.041">selections that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="652.269" dur="5.711">disturbing Trump has promised maximum</text>
  <text start="655.87" dur="5.009">punishment and penalties to these folks</text>
  <text start="657.98" dur="5.07">I don&amp;#39;t know how he&amp;#39;ll pull that off but</text>
  <text start="660.879" dur="5.5">we have to consider that a lot of these</text>
  <text start="663.05" dur="4.17">guys are gonna be tried by lefty judges</text>
  <text start="666.379" dur="9.69">that believe in what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="667.22" dur="9.929">anyway good man Jack you live in LA and</text>
  <text start="676.069" dur="5.361">you have an electric fence charger</text>
  <text start="677.149" dur="4.281">hooked up to your sign that&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="691.63" dur="2.96">mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="700.8" dur="4.05">no I I don&amp;#39;t know about the Clinton</text>
  <text start="703.11" dur="4.55">black face I do know about the Jimmy</text>
  <text start="704.85" dur="2.81">Kimmel black face</text>
  <text start="719.75" dur="6.019">Nicholas is asking when will the marshal</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="6.659">walk come will it be after the midterms</text>
  <text start="725.769" dur="5.651">so I think that it will be like on a</text>
  <text start="729.379" dur="4.65">case like city by city basis it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="731.42" dur="4.2">necessarily be nationwide it won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="734.029" dur="3.3">what people always see in the movies</text>
  <text start="735.62" dur="3.63">where there&amp;#39;s like soldiers on the</text>
  <text start="737.329" dur="4.2">street corners that might be in like a a</text>
  <text start="739.25" dur="4.92">localized area for a short time while</text>
  <text start="741.529" dur="4.651">they round up and do the mass arrests as</text>
  <text start="744.17" dur="5.49">for the mass arrests and stuff that has</text>
  <text start="746.18" dur="5.009">to happen after midterms and possibly</text>
  <text start="749.66" dur="2.729">after the first because some of the</text>
  <text start="751.189" dur="5.971">things that Trump did don&amp;#39;t go into</text>
  <text start="752.389" dur="6.63">effect until the first so you know we</text>
  <text start="757.16" dur="4.859">also have to consider that q did tell us</text>
  <text start="759.019" dur="7.62">though that 2018 would be a great year</text>
  <text start="762.019" dur="6.57">and q define that later on in the</text>
  <text start="766.639" dur="5.101">context of that saying that if that</text>
  <text start="768.589" dur="7.011">means bad guys are dead or afraid or</text>
  <text start="771.74" dur="6.48">suffering dead or that are suffering so</text>
  <text start="775.6" dur="5.56">people like McCain for example who have</text>
  <text start="778.22" dur="8.78">had suspicious deaths all suddenly and</text>
  <text start="781.16" dur="5.84">such I suspect we&amp;#39;ll see more of those</text>
  <text start="787.24" dur="4.51">they&amp;#39;ll probably call it natural causes</text>
  <text start="789.68" dur="5.25">or Suicider or overdoses or whatever</text>
  <text start="791.75" dur="6.199">rather anything but the truth you know</text>
  <text start="794.93" dur="3.019">treasonous pedophiles</text>
  <text start="802.21" dur="5.71">William Joseph what do you think of</text>

  <text start="825.86" dur="2.34">knowledge of cue and none of that was</text>
  <text start="827.78" dur="4.41">true</text>

  <text start="1967.44" dur="9.18">research over a long period of time I</text>
  <text start="1970.26" dur="9.11">have a product that I started partnering</text>
  <text start="1976.62" dur="7.65">with you can find it on my website</text>
  <text start="1979.37" dur="8.35">called HeLa cream which has something</text>
  <text start="1984.27" dur="6.45">called EDTA in it which is a powerful</text>
  <text start="1987.72" dur="5.089">key later and it&amp;#39;s best absorbed by a</text>
  <text start="1990.72" dur="4.8">lotion so they put it into a lotion and</text>
  <text start="1992.809" dur="4.811">it&amp;#39;s a weak dose so it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="1995.52" dur="5.76">overflow you but you still have to have</text>
  <text start="1997.62" dur="5.91">some general knowledge of the things</text>
  <text start="2001.28" dur="4.889">that will help to detox like you need to</text>
  <text start="2003.53" dur="4.5">if this kicks them the heavy metal out</text>
  <text start="2006.169" dur="3.211">somewhere you need the things that the</text>
  <text start="2008.03" dur="2.82">proteins and the binders that will</text>
  <text start="2009.38" dur="2.94">connect to it and pull it out of your</text>
  <text start="2010.85" dur="3.209">body otherwise you&amp;#39;re dumping it from</text>

  <text start="2014.059" dur="6.271">this that you need but this will help</text>
  <text start="2018.169" dur="7.321">with things like lead stuff like that</text>
  <text start="2020.33" dur="6.42">EDTA is a pretty powerful key later but</text>
  <text start="2025.49" dur="3.39">it doesn&amp;#39;t help with mercury as much</text>
  <text start="2026.75" dur="5.8">that&amp;#39;s the thing there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="2028.88" dur="5.68">great science coming out in that area</text>
  <text start="2032.55" dur="3.81">like dr. Boyd has something that will</text>
  <text start="2034.56" dur="4.05">basically just pull mercury out of your</text>
  <text start="2036.36" dur="5.13">body no problems he was giving it to</text>
  <text start="2038.61" dur="5.91">rats with like 30 times or something</text>
  <text start="2041.49" dur="5.07">than the lethal level of mercury as an</text>
  <text start="2044.52" dur="3.96">injection just sticking it in them and</text>
  <text start="2046.56" dur="4.74">the rats just passed it all no problem</text>
  <text start="2048.48" dur="3.99">no health no health issues the one they</text>
  <text start="2051.3" dur="4.35">should have just died immediately</text>
  <text start="2052.47" dur="4.83">so his with no side effects so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2055.65" dur="5.73">the kind of stuff that&amp;#39;s potentially out</text>
  <text start="2057.3" dur="7.49">there but it&amp;#39;s difficult to get any of</text>
  <text start="2061.38" dur="6.33">the powerful ki laters for mercury</text>
  <text start="2064.79" dur="4.21">because regulations and rules things</text>
  <text start="2067.71" dur="3.21">like that it&amp;#39;s actually really difficult</text>
  <text start="2069" dur="3.42">to get that stuff so I was looking for a</text>
  <text start="2070.92" dur="5.67">long time to try to find some different</text>
  <text start="2072.42" dur="5.58">ones so this is great for like the stuff</text>
  <text start="2076.59" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s just in your water supply like</text>
  <text start="2078" dur="6.06">the lead and things like that I use</text>
  <text start="2080.31" dur="8">chlorella I use a couple different just</text>
  <text start="2084.06" dur="9">herbal support things like tincture of</text>
  <text start="2088.31" dur="6.91">cilantro glutathione the liposomal</text>
  <text start="2093.06" dur="4.5">glutathione that I make I use those</text>
  <text start="2095.22" dur="3.81">things kind of to cohesively attack the</text>
  <text start="2097.56" dur="3.99">heavy-metal issue is for those who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2099.03" dur="3.9">know I had eight silver amalgams and my</text>
  <text start="2101.55" dur="3.39">in my mouth</text>
  <text start="2102.93" dur="3.45">and if you don&amp;#39;t chelate if you have</text>
  <text start="2104.94" dur="2.55">those by the way like you have to get</text>
  <text start="2106.38" dur="3.89">rid of those first or you&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="2107.49" dur="5.16">pull it out of your teeth into your body</text>
  <text start="2110.27" dur="4.06">like if you switch with liposomal</text>
  <text start="2112.65" dur="4.14">glutathione and you have metal in your</text>
  <text start="2114.33" dur="4.2">mouth it&amp;#39;s not gonna good be good you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2116.79" dur="5.3">gonna you&amp;#39;re gonna just have us like a</text>
  <text start="2118.53" dur="3.56">whole bunch of mercury liquid</text>
  <text start="2130.76" dur="6.48">okay yeah there are some supporters for</text>
  <text start="2135.2" dur="5.82">like victim says take iodine with</text>
  <text start="2137.24" dur="5.46">selenium and d3 with k2 yeah the there</text>
  <text start="2141.02" dur="6.47">are a lot of things that you could take</text>
  <text start="2142.7" dur="9.09">that are synergistic like when you take</text>
  <text start="2147.49" dur="6.6">iodine you can take salt that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="2151.79" dur="7.35">supporter good center like celtic salt</text>
  <text start="2154.09" dur="7.12">and yes selenium is up there best place</text>
  <text start="2159.14" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;ve seen to do it is either just eat</text>
  <text start="2161.21" dur="5.28">raw like from from a cheap perspective</text>
  <text start="2163.88" dur="5.76">raw mustard seed that you can grind up</text>
  <text start="2166.49" dur="6.66">or break the shell in some way before</text>
  <text start="2169.64" dur="5.49">you swallow it so you can digest it but</text>
  <text start="2173.15" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s very spicy it&amp;#39;s very hot some</text>
  <text start="2175.13" dur="3.989">people would probably be better off just</text>
  <text start="2176.57" dur="5.67">ordering pills for that one I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="2179.119" dur="5.041">to get into sprouting my my mustard now</text>
  <text start="2182.24" dur="4.379">I&amp;#39;ll let you guys know how that goes</text>
  <text start="2184.16" dur="10.56">later it&amp;#39;s not they&amp;#39;re not coming out</text>
  <text start="2186.619" dur="11.871">too strong on the first batch Leonard</text>
  <text start="2194.72" dur="6.48">says do you have any opinion on DMSO yes</text>
  <text start="2198.49" dur="4.57">you know in theory you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="2201.2" dur="3.72">ever have a needle again that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2203.06" dur="3.77">what they were thinking about using DMSO</text>
  <text start="2204.92" dur="5.13">to actually replace needles at one point</text>
  <text start="2206.83" dur="5.23">in my personal experience I used it to</text>
  <text start="2210.05" dur="4.89">not have to inject b12 because I was</text>
  <text start="2212.06" dur="5.64">getting b12 injections for energy before</text>
  <text start="2214.94" dur="4.23">I knew about like alternative health and</text>
  <text start="2217.7" dur="4.2">stuff I just wanted to get the benefit</text>
  <text start="2219.17" dur="4.65">of the b12 and if you guys have ever</text>
  <text start="2221.9" dur="3.51">done that they&amp;#39;ll take a needle and</text>
  <text start="2223.82" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;ll inject it into your thigh like</text>
  <text start="2225.41" dur="5.4">pretty deep it&amp;#39;s such a thin needle I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2228.23" dur="3.93">done it to myself barely hurt but it</text>
  <text start="2230.81" dur="4.95">still wasn&amp;#39;t Pleasant so I tried the</text>
  <text start="2232.16" dur="7.47">DMSO approach and it just made my arm</text>
  <text start="2235.76" dur="5.55">break out it worked though but for those</text>
  <text start="2239.63" dur="4.02">who don&amp;#39;t know DMSO has this interesting</text>
  <text start="2241.31" dur="3.72">property of binding to things and when</text>
  <text start="2243.65" dur="2.49">you rub it on like a lotion it pulls</text>
  <text start="2245.03" dur="4.89">those things directly in your</text>
  <text start="2246.14" dur="5.729">bloodstream it just it opens up in the</text>
  <text start="2249.92" dur="5.75">door and it can be anything that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="2251.869" dur="3.801">this the stuff it could be bad stuff too</text>
  <text start="2257.53" dur="5.08">interesting stuff though DMSO is very</text>
  <text start="2260.3" dur="6.65">interesting some people just take it for</text>
  <text start="2262.61" dur="4.34">for health benefits I haven&amp;#39;t done that</text>
  <text start="2268.87" dur="4.39">RT yeah CBD oil has a lot of good</text>
  <text start="2271.91" dur="3.33">benefits to it I mean I&amp;#39;ve done the</text>

  <text start="2767.41" dur="5.67">can&amp;#39;t ignore it much longer and I think</text>
  <text start="2770.29" dur="5.37">you know with recent precedents that are</text>
  <text start="2773.08" dur="4.56">being set like like Bayer which bought</text>

  <text start="2795.01" dur="4.68">destroy their company and and that sets</text>
  <text start="2798.43" dur="2.97">a good precedent because that&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="2799.69" dur="3.06">similar situation to what we see with</text>
  <text start="2801.4" dur="4.35">the vaccine issue which is probably</text>
  <text start="2802.75" dur="4.92">bigger even then the the glyphosate</text>
  <text start="2805.75" dur="5.55">issue and the roundup products that are</text>
  <text start="2807.67" dur="5.55">just killing people so you know it has</text>
  <text start="2811.3" dur="4.559">to happen but my position has also been</text>
  <text start="2813.22" dur="4.68">we got to drain the swamp we&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="2815.859" dur="3.121">get the bad guys that are like the enemy</text>
  <text start="2817.9" dur="2.61">soldiers have to be out of the way</text>
  <text start="2818.98" dur="4.32">before we can deal with civilians you</text>
  <text start="2820.51" dur="4.26">know and that&amp;#39;s just a hard way of</text>
  <text start="2823.3" dur="4.34">looking at it because every day children</text>
  <text start="2824.77" dur="5.13">are damaged for life by these vaccines</text>
  <text start="2827.64" dur="4.84">yes I believe that much of it can be</text>
  <text start="2829.9" dur="3.959">reversed but who&amp;#39;s gonna do that like</text>
  <text start="2832.48" dur="1.98">most of them don&amp;#39;t even realize that the</text>
  <text start="2833.859" dur="2.49">vaccine is</text>
  <text start="2834.46" dur="4.26">cause the damage much less than half the</text>
  <text start="2836.349" dur="4.26">time and energy and the money too to</text>
  <text start="2838.72" dur="4.05">learn how to detox these things over</text>
  <text start="2840.609" dur="3.601">time that&amp;#39;s why I talk about cheap stuff</text>
  <text start="2842.77" dur="4.2">things that you can do at home things</text>
  <text start="2844.21" dur="4.56">that save you money DIY solutions you</text>
  <text start="2846.97" dur="3.18">know I sell a couple things because</text>

  <text start="2876.46" dur="4.17">soldiers out of the way</text>
  <text start="2878.47" dur="3.57">you know enemy combatants basically at</text>

  <text start="2882.04" dur="4.68">combatants and the media that support</text>
  <text start="2884.29" dur="4.77">them once we get them out of the way we</text>

  <text start="3289.729" dur="7.62">legalese homework to be able to do that</text>
  <text start="3292.329" dur="6.97">so when I sell iodine it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it has</text>
  <text start="3297.349" dur="4.62">the information on how much is in there</text>
  <text start="3299.299" dur="5.76">and it has a water drop I don&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="3301.969" dur="5.64">dosages things like that but I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="3305.059" dur="4.8">videos that have that information in it</text>
  <text start="3307.609" dur="4.98">I&amp;#39;ll include you know kind of a flyer</text>

  <text start="3312.589" dur="5.73">information in it and it&amp;#39;s all there</text>
  <text start="3316.4" dur="4.169">defined either on my website or on my</text>
  <text start="3318.319" dur="4.29">channel or all in the paper so you know</text>

  <text start="3330.979" dur="5.31">important things for babies yeah</text>
  <text start="3334.67" dur="3.72">and if you&amp;#39;re doing it it&amp;#39;s a good idea</text>
  <text start="3336.289" dur="5.31">start slowly with one or two drops</text>
  <text start="3338.39" dur="5.969">because it&amp;#39;s very powerful stuff but I</text>
  <text start="3341.599" dur="7.47">take four drops a day and my wife who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3344.359" dur="6.571">nursing takes 8 to 12 drops a day and so</text>

  <text start="3353.9" dur="3.66">thinking I got some extra IQ points out</text>
  <text start="3355.94" dur="4.59">of the iodine because that research</text>
  <text start="3357.56" dur="5.51">shows you can actually give your baby</text>
  <text start="3360.53" dur="6.96">more IQ points if you&amp;#39;re on iodine</text>
  <text start="3363.07" dur="7.48">during and after pregnancy when I give</text>
  <text start="3367.49" dur="5.13">it to my dogs I do like one drop of the</text>
  <text start="3370.55" dur="5.01">of the solution in an entire bowl of</text>
  <text start="3372.62" dur="6.06">water because it&amp;#39;s not an exact dosing</text>
  <text start="3375.56" dur="6.15">but you know is something where they had</text>
  <text start="3378.68" dur="4.56">nothing before when I give it to my</text>
  <text start="3381.71" dur="3.09">rabbits I do the same thing because</text>
  <text start="3383.24" dur="4.35">sometimes my rabbits will poop in their</text>
  <text start="3384.8" dur="5.43">water bowls so that that creates germs</text>
  <text start="3387.59" dur="4.95">iodine is a great disinfectant for water</text>
  <text start="3390.23" dur="4.32">so not only am i given the rabbits</text>
  <text start="3392.54" dur="4.19">iodine I&amp;#39;m also keeping their their</text>
  <text start="3394.55" dur="4.08">water clean so that&amp;#39;s pretty neat and</text>

  <text start="3857.11" dur="4.47">like that that keeps me around longer</text>
  <text start="3858.75" dur="6.39">he&amp;#39;s asking do you think cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="3861.58" dur="6.21">will free humanity I think he can I</text>
  <text start="3865.14" dur="4.12">think it has the ability to do so it has</text>
  <text start="3867.79" dur="3.99">the ability to free us from the banking</text>
  <text start="3869.26" dur="4.5">system from having to have trust in</text>
  <text start="3871.78" dur="4.59">anyone for anything anymore</text>
  <text start="3873.76" dur="5.01">it could eventually eliminate the need</text>
  <text start="3876.37" dur="6.72">for government as well it could make</text>
  <text start="3878.77" dur="6.54">free-market capitalism thing but they</text>
  <text start="3883.09" dur="4.65">could also on the flip side of that if</text>
  <text start="3885.31" dur="4.53">we don&amp;#39;t go the route of freedom if we</text>
  <text start="3887.74" dur="3.48">go the route of fear and and regulation</text>
  <text start="3889.84" dur="2.88">and government control then we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3891.22" dur="3.12">gonna get a cryptocurrency we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3892.72" dur="4.5">get a digital currency and that&amp;#39;s what</text>

  <text start="3897.22" dur="5.61">slavery forever so we&amp;#39;re at a very</text>
  <text start="3899.44" dur="5.31">interesting time if people choose crypto</text>
  <text start="3902.83" dur="5.76">currencies decentralized technologies</text>
  <text start="3904.75" dur="5.52">trustless systems trusting numbers and</text>
  <text start="3908.59" dur="5.15">technology rather than politicians and</text>
  <text start="3910.27" dur="3.47">bankers we have a chance</text>

  <text start="3916.55" dur="4.14">talked about gab being banned but</text>
  <text start="3918.44" dur="5.3">basically this is a terrible thing to do</text>
