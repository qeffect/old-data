  <text start="6.27" dur="6.71">you some interesting information on this</text>
  <text start="7.56" dur="7.35">one so it turns out that the Illuminati</text>
  <text start="12.98" dur="5.02">maybe are a little bit more transparent</text>
  <text start="14.91" dur="4.77">so rather than call it some sort of like</text>
  <text start="18" dur="3.51">you know I always feel like the</text>
  <text start="19.68" dur="3.87">Illuminati thing is a bit of a rabbit</text>
  <text start="21.51" dur="5.91">hole in and of itself and and there is</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="5.76">some truth to the idea of sort of you</text>
  <text start="27.42" dur="3.869">know multi-generational wealth and</text>
  <text start="29.31" dur="5.73">dynastic wealth and and and the power</text>
  <text start="31.289" dur="5.551">that that can achieve over time but in</text>
  <text start="35.04" dur="5.88">today&amp;#39;s world it seems as though the</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="6.45">power concentration is more more banker</text>
  <text start="40.92" dur="4.95">or less bloodline it seems now let me</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="5.19">let me back that up so this article came</text>
  <text start="45.87" dur="4.98">out on New Scientist calm and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="4.05">called reveal the capitalist network</text>
  <text start="50.85" dur="3.54">that runs the world you can kind of tell</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="5.07">the idea of it just from the image here</text>
  <text start="54.39" dur="6.21">these guys did a sort of a kind of an</text>
  <text start="57.6" dur="4.709">impartial breakdown of all the public of</text>
  <text start="60.6" dur="3.629">you know available records and there may</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="3.541">be some stuff off the books let some</text>
  <text start="64.229" dur="3.781">available records of the who&amp;#39;s who of</text>
  <text start="65.85" dur="3.78">who owns white and how it&amp;#39;s cross</text>
  <text start="68.01" dur="3.78">connected and who owns which of white</text>
  <text start="69.63" dur="5.01">different companies and it turns out</text>
  <text start="71.79" dur="5.91">that there&amp;#39;s about 12 hunt was about</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="9.51">1200 or so here come my dogs I hear them</text>
  <text start="77.7" dur="8.84">I think it was 1200 or so of the primary</text>
  <text start="84.15" dur="6.929">companies owned about 20% of the market</text>
  <text start="86.54" dur="7.84">looking for that number 13 18 so a core</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="5.761">of 1300 1300 18 companies had</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="7.23">interlocking ownerships of course and</text>
  <text start="96.84" dur="6.48">they had each had an average ty of two</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="3.42">two or more other companies and on</text>
  <text start="103.32" dur="3.72">average they were connected to 20 okay</text>
  <text start="105.03" dur="3.24">so each of the 13 18 had ties to two or</text>
  <text start="107.04" dur="3.359">more other companies and on average they</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="4.08">were connected to 20 so these guys are</text>
  <text start="110.399" dur="3.811">just like the umbrella corporations or</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="3.78">something for they&amp;#39;re connected so much</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="3.33">to each other the big guys you know they</text>
  <text start="116.13" dur="2.879">have they buy each other stock sometimes</text>
  <text start="117.54" dur="4.109">as well so they can diversify or</text>
  <text start="119.009" dur="5.25">whatever that&amp;#39;s how you do it I guess if</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="6.661">you&amp;#39;re like a Buffett or something or</text>
  <text start="124.259" dur="5.97">gates anyway so of course these networks</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.5">it points out are unstable as we learned</text>
  <text start="130.229" dur="3.391">in 2008 but and their systemic these</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="2.88">things were so inter</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="3.6">connected that the corruption is so bad</text>
  <text start="135.69" dur="2.64">that when they went up one of them goes</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="3.68">down they&amp;#39;re all gonna go down right</text>
  <text start="138.33" dur="5.43">because they are so interconnected so</text>
  <text start="140.9" dur="7">but even of that top 1,300 something</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="6.089">companies there is a top 50 of 147 super</text>
  <text start="147.9" dur="4.949">connected companies and these control</text>
  <text start="149.849" dur="5.911">most of those other 1,300 so these are</text>
  <text start="152.849" dur="5.791">the top 50 most powerful money wise</text>
