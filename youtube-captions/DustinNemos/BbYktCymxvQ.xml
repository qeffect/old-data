  <text start="3259.42" dur="9.149">tremendous difference tremendous</text>
  <text start="3263.019" dur="7.381">difference No Paris France they say has</text>
  <text start="3268.569" dur="5.371">the strongest gun lawyers of the world</text>
  <text start="3270.4" dur="5.04">and you remember those maniacs when they</text>
  <text start="3273.94" dur="5.01">went into the nightclub I used this</text>
  <text start="3275.44" dur="6.569">example there are many examples but they</text>
  <text start="3278.95" dur="7.369">shot one person another person another</text>
  <text start="3282.009" dur="8.99">person another person hundreds of people</text>
  <text start="3286.319" dur="10.24">dead and horribly wounded to this day</text>
  <text start="3290.999" dur="8.741">that was five years ago if there was one</text>
  <text start="3296.559" dur="7.05">gun being carried by one person on the</text>
  <text start="3299.74" dur="8.19">other side it very well could have been</text>

  <text start="3307.93" dur="5.879">went on so long and there wasn&amp;#39;t a thing</text>
  <text start="3311.14" dur="8.099">you could do about it get over here</text>
  <text start="3313.809" dur="9.871">boom get over here boom and then they</text>
  <text start="3319.239" dur="7.38">left they were captured later there was</text>
  <text start="3323.68" dur="5.609">only one gun there were two three four</text>
  <text start="3326.619" dur="6.061">it wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened</text>
  <text start="3329.289" dur="5.881">tiny percentage by comparison but it</text>
  <text start="3332.68" dur="5.01">probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened because</text>
  <text start="3335.17" dur="4.109">the cowards would have known there are</text>
  <text start="3337.69" dur="4.829">people in there having guns wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3339.279" dur="4.83">have happened so people don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="3342.519" dur="4.651">understand the other side of the</text>
  <text start="3344.109" dur="6">argument I have the debate a lot and I</text>
  <text start="3347.17" dur="5.25">win the debate all the time and the next</text>
  <text start="3350.109" dur="4.68">day you see the same person who was so</text>
  <text start="3352.42" dur="7.02">badly defeated in the debate going out</text>
  <text start="3354.789" dur="8.341">and saying the same thing even though he</text>
  <text start="3359.44" dur="5.97">or she I really believe know that you</text>
  <text start="3363.13" dur="6.66">can&amp;#39;t justify their side of the argument</text>
  <text start="3365.41" dur="8.99">so gun owners make our communities</text>
  <text start="3369.79" dur="7.29">safer and they make our nation stronger</text>
  <text start="3374.4" dur="5.08">Americans have always understood this</text>
  <text start="3377.08" dur="5.58">truth going back to the earliest days of</text>

  <text start="3418.41" dur="6.01">they already loved our country and they</text>
  <text start="3422.41" dur="5.79">were determined to defend their rights</text>
  <text start="3424.42" dur="7.23">to the death when hundreds of British</text>
  <text start="3428.2" dur="6.95">soldiers arrived at the bridge the</text>
  <text start="3431.65" dur="6.66">Americans stood firm blocking their path</text>

  <text start="3463.48" dur="9.69">shirt and dared him to do his worst</text>
  <text start="3469.11" dur="6.28">soon the crowd grew larger as civilians</text>
  <text start="3473.17" dur="6.98">came from miles around to stand</text>
  <text start="3475.39" dur="9.65">side-by-side with their great countrymen</text>
