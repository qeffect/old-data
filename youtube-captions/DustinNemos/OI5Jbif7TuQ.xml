  <text start="50.67" dur="5.19">fallout okay so the big thing on my mind</text>
  <text start="53.61" dur="4.91">is that Q had you know for those who</text>
  <text start="55.86" dur="6.449">follow Q he had kind of predicted this</text>
  <text start="58.52" dur="5.98">5347 way back at the Cavanaugh situation</text>
  <text start="62.309" dur="4.74">and recently his last post on the 12th</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="6.51">of the 13th if I&amp;#39;m recalling is also the</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="5.731">same thing 53 to 47 and that&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="3.84">insane amount of foreknowledge right</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="4.589">there it&amp;#39;s even 4q standards that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="74.85" dur="5.94">particularly impressive but even aside</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="5.011">from that we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="80.79" dur="3.869">investigations we&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="4.559">kind of justice in at least some of</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="3.331">these situations but they&amp;#39;re still you</text>
  <text start="86.939" dur="3.451">know they seem to have gotten away with</text>
  <text start="87.99" dur="3.75">some of it what do you think I think</text>
  <text start="90.39" dur="3.03">they&amp;#39;ve gotten away with a lot of it</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="4.62">unfortunately and it continues to this</text>
  <text start="93.42" dur="4.5">day you know and you pointed this out</text>
  <text start="96.36" dur="3.99">you know some of our previous</text>
  <text start="97.92" dur="4.559">discussions dust and and and many people</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="7.049">are saying well you know Trump is making</text>
  <text start="102.479" dur="7.14">this big deal that is 5347 and and and</text>
  <text start="107.399" dur="5.97">this really isn&amp;#39;t such a huge change</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="5.731">from he had 51 votes before well as you</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="4.921">and I have discussed he didn&amp;#39;t have 51</text>
  <text start="115.35" dur="6">votes before he had McCain in there he</text>
  <text start="118.29" dur="5.07">had flake in there in he had Corcoran at</text>
  <text start="121.35" dur="6.689">a mat and that doesn&amp;#39;t include Olivia</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="7.769">snow and Murkowski from Alaska so it you</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="5.391">know it a max at an absolute max he had</text>
  <text start="131.129" dur="6.95">48 maybe</text>
  <text start="133.43" dur="6.33">46 going in yeah and now so so we still</text>
  <text start="138.079" dur="3.541">as Murkowski there he still has snow</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="6.869">there but snow came through big on the</text>
  <text start="141.62" dur="9.449">Kavanagh event so now he&amp;#39;s up to 53 and</text>
  <text start="146.629" dur="6.48">this is I think important because as you</text>
  <text start="151.069" dur="5.971">and I have also discussed previously the</text>
  <text start="153.109" dur="6.66">power right now as far as investing or</text>
  <text start="157.04" dur="5.91">investigative hurry power is going to</text>
  <text start="159.769" dur="5.34">come to the Senate and we just heard</text>
  <text start="162.95" dur="4.14">that Grassley is gonna give up the gavel</text>
  <text start="165.109" dur="4.591">and in charge of the Judiciary Committee</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="4.95">and hand that over to Lindsey Graham you</text>
  <text start="169.7" dur="4.709">know Lindsey Graham I had had some huge</text>
  <text start="172.04" dur="5.49">problems with Lindsey Graham</text>
  <text start="174.409" dur="8.06">I really have well lately III really had</text>
  <text start="177.53" dur="8.039">him pegged as a globalist I had him as a</text>
  <text start="182.469" dur="5.531">going hand-in-hand with John McCain I</text>
  <text start="185.569" dur="5.84">was not a fan of John McCain I felt John</text>
  <text start="188" dur="9.079">McCain was a globalist of the enth power</text>
  <text start="191.409" dur="9.19">wreak more havoc than anyone I know</text>
  <text start="197.079" dur="5.59">that&amp;#39;s currently in the Senate worldwide</text>
  <text start="200.599" dur="4.651">there wasn&amp;#39;t a war that man didn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="202.669" dur="4.5">there was an event that didn&amp;#39;t lead to</text>
  <text start="205.25" dur="4.47">mass chaos or killing that he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="207.169" dur="4.02">involved with him I&amp;#39;m not true and some</text>
  <text start="209.72" dur="2.849">people will now accuse me of speaking</text>
  <text start="211.189" dur="5.061">ill of the dead no I&amp;#39;m just speaking</text>
  <text start="212.569" dur="6.53">factually of a person who I I believe</text>
  <text start="216.25" dur="5.799">I&amp;#39;ll speak ill for you he was a bad guy</text>
  <text start="219.099" dur="4.78">he really was in my opinion and and I</text>
  <text start="222.049" dur="3.9">felt that Graham was hand in hand with</text>
  <text start="223.879" dur="7.35">him now it just so happens that when</text>
  <text start="225.949" dur="7.951">McCain left the scene Lindsey Graham the</text>
  <text start="231.229" dur="7.801">best way to describe it flipped mhm and</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="7.44">and if his his presentation in the</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="4.139">Cavanaugh initial hearing where he</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="7.289">brought up the issue of military</text>
  <text start="243.169" dur="8.28">tribunals to me was a hallmark event</text>
  <text start="248.629" dur="6.89">because I did some research on it Dustin</text>
  <text start="251.449" dur="6.63">and I am unaware of military tribunals</text>
  <text start="255.519" dur="4.9">being brought up at a Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="258.079" dur="4.411">justices hearing in the history of our</text>
  <text start="260.419" dur="2.731">country yeah why even bring that up if</text>
  <text start="262.49" dur="2.399">you don&amp;#39;t mean it</text>
  <text start="263.15" dur="4.12">that&amp;#39;s right and you&amp;#39;ll notice when he</text>
  <text start="264.889" dur="6.851">did bring it up the other side</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="7.619">always so vocal the Booker&amp;#39;s the the</text>
  <text start="271.74" dur="6.269">Feinstein&amp;#39;s were dead silent mm-hmm dead</text>
  <text start="274.889" dur="5.581">silent and it was very soon after that</text>
  <text start="278.009" dur="4.711">discussion that very lengthy five-minute</text>
  <text start="280.47" dur="5.789">discussion occurred in Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.72" dur="5.81">hearing it was very soon after that that</text>
  <text start="286.259" dur="6.181">we first started to get wind of</text>
  <text start="288.53" dur="5.74">Christine bleh c4 mhm and up until that</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="4.14">remember Feinstein had been sitting on</text>
  <text start="294.27" dur="4.769">it information for seven six seven weeks</text>
  <text start="296.58" dur="4.44">at that point but then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="299.039" dur="4.171">it was after what Graham had brought up</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="6.06">and I believe what Graham did it that</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="7.1">hearing was he put the globalist</text>
  <text start="307.08" dur="5.82">syndicate and their puppets on notice</text>
  <text start="310.31" dur="4.84">yeah we have a criminal justice system</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="5.6">but we also have the military tribunal</text>
  <text start="315.15" dur="5.819">system for treason first edition and</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="6.419">Cavanaugh confirmed that and I believe</text>
  <text start="320.969" dur="7.111">that&amp;#39;s why they came out so so</text>
  <text start="324.919" dur="6.43">vehemently violently against Cavanaugh</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="7.29">and then will Lindsey Graham backed that</text>
  <text start="331.349" dur="7.741">up when they had that secondary hearing</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="7.349">about place a forward and as we all know</text>
  <text start="339.09" dur="5.91">how Lindsey Graham came forward and said</text>
  <text start="342.719" dur="4.95">you know wait a minute you know this is</text>
  <text start="345" dur="4.5">a this is a Clarence Thomas type of</text>
  <text start="347.669" dur="2.49">lynching going on here and this has got</text>
  <text start="349.5" dur="4.65">to stop</text>
  <text start="350.159" dur="6.331">so the fact that we have Lindsey Graham</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="5.19">now gonna take the gravel gavel from</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="3.51">Grassley I believe is a positive</text>
  <text start="359.34" dur="4.29">development</text>
  <text start="360" dur="6.93">a year ago Dustin I would have said it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="4.95">a very negative development and I</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="3.539">believe this is something that it is</text>
  <text start="368.58" dur="3.75">that is that it&amp;#39;s an indication of</text>
  <text start="370.469" dur="3.931">what&amp;#39;s happening behind the scenes I</text>
  <text start="372.33" dur="5.519">believe what&amp;#39;s happening behind the</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="7.29">scenes is a number of these former</text>
  <text start="377.849" dur="8.281">globalist players are starting to play</text>
  <text start="381.69" dur="7.83">ball with the Trump team then the the</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="5.849">Nationalists know now and again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="4.17">trying to denigrate the term nationalist</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="4.11">we see this time and time again whether</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s an NPR reporter asking the question</text>
  <text start="396.089" dur="3.721">and they always try to frame it as a</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="2.97">white nationalist issue as you&amp;#39;re aware</text>
  <text start="399.81" dur="3.38">which is</text>
  <text start="400.77" dur="4.92">thing of the sort or yeah or at least</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="4.77">painted as a racist and last I checked</text>
  <text start="405.69" dur="7.289">American is not a race</text>
  <text start="407.96" dur="11.049">correct so so the the bottom line is is</text>
  <text start="412.979" dur="10.231">that with this election I believe the</text>
  <text start="419.009" dur="9.03">Trump team&amp;#39;s goal was to enhance the</text>
  <text start="423.21" dur="7.56">position of Trump and his team within</text>
  <text start="428.039" dur="5.22">the Senate mm-hmm and I believe that</text>
  <text start="430.77" dur="4.29">occurred yeah we and I both and I</text>
  <text start="433.259" dur="5.641">believe that has the deep state the</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="5.609">globalist syndicate very upset to</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="3.389">reinforce some of your points we still</text>
  <text start="440.669" dur="3.391">have flake in office and he&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="442.289" dur="3.151">trying to sabotage things even though</text>
  <text start="444.06" dur="3.87">he&amp;#39;s supposed to be a Republican and</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="4.5">right after the Cavanaugh situation we</text>
  <text start="447.93" dur="4.95">have Hillary going on long multi tweet</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="4.979">rants on on Twitter just trying to bash</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="5.55">Kevin on non-stop you could tell there</text>
  <text start="454.919" dur="6.21">was fear absolutely and remember we also</text>
  <text start="458.43" dur="4.65">have Paul Ryan who is a globalist player</text>
  <text start="461.129" dur="5.311">that&amp;#39;s still trying to undermine what</text>
  <text start="463.08" dur="9">the house potentially can do in this if</text>
  <text start="466.44" dur="11.42">you will lame duck position at this</text>
  <text start="472.08" dur="8.519">point Paul Ryan good riddance</text>
  <text start="477.86" dur="2.98">don&amp;#39;t let the door hit you on your way</text>
  <text start="480.599" dur="5.521">out</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="7.47">but Paul Ryan I believe his final</text>
  <text start="486.12" dur="5.07">assignment by the globalists syndicate</text>
  <text start="488.31" dur="4.32">by the deep state was to hold back the</text>
  <text start="491.19" dur="5.19">house and they&amp;#39;re investigating</text>
  <text start="492.63" dur="9.629">investigatory abilities as long as</text>
  <text start="496.38" dur="8.58">possible to if you will prevent the</text>
  <text start="502.259" dur="4.801">Trump team from making any inroads in</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="4.98">the election as it relates to the house</text>
  <text start="507.06" dur="5.839">you know Dustin Greg hunter pointed out</text>
  <text start="509.94" dur="5.07">to me that the you know there were 44</text>
  <text start="512.899" dur="5.161">Republican House members that did not</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="5.909">seek re-election yeah well first run</text>
  <text start="518.06" dur="4.81">right now right now isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="520.919" dur="5.521">interesting so right now they have the</text>
  <text start="522.87" dur="7.709">White House they have the Senate they</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="7.17">had the house yet 44 so this is as good</text>
  <text start="530.579" dur="3.811">as it gets right 44 of these folks</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="4.2">walked away</text>
  <text start="534.39" dur="5.34">and in for example just a highlight Ron</text>
  <text start="537.81" dur="3.779">he&amp;#39;s a young guy he didn&amp;#39;t just lose all</text>
  <text start="539.73" dur="3.21">of his ambition why would he do</text>
  <text start="541.589" dur="4.351">something like this people in power</text>
  <text start="542.94" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t typically step down and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="3.63">not even just there but thousands of</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="4.17">people stepped down since that executive</text>
  <text start="549.57" dur="4.29">order from Trump know declaring</text>
  <text start="551.91" dur="4.169">basically a state of emergency and going</text>
  <text start="553.86" dur="3.75">after the assets of those involved in</text>
  <text start="556.079" dur="5.671">corruption and human trafficking last</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="7.969">December so it is a little Talon right</text>
  <text start="561.75" dur="7.11">Hollywood high tech Wall Street</text>
  <text start="565.579" dur="5.291">Washington you know these are the hubs</text>
  <text start="568.86" dur="6.84">that the globalist syndicate have</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="6.42">developed over many decades time so so</text>
  <text start="575.7" dur="3.629">the fact that these people would leave</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="5.25">to me was an indication but here&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="579.329" dur="4.5">Paul Ryan stepped in and the Greg hunter</text>
  <text start="582.54" dur="4.44">pointed this out to me and I&amp;#39;ve actually</text>
  <text start="583.829" dur="5.521">felt he was wrong and then talked to</text>
  <text start="586.98" dur="6.09">some of my behind-the-curtain sources</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="8.81">about it and they confirmed it 39 as of</text>
  <text start="593.07" dur="9.9">August 7th 39 of those open seats</text>
  <text start="598.16" dur="7.27">essentially that Ryan and the Republican</text>
  <text start="602.97" dur="5.25">Party had not placed any one of</text>
  <text start="605.43" dur="5.79">significance in 39 of those districts</text>
  <text start="608.22" dur="4.619">default wins yeah he fought wins it well</text>
  <text start="611.22" dur="3.42">da so Sammy said well what about the</text>
  <text start="612.839" dur="4.471">Dems well the Dems only had three</text>
  <text start="614.64" dur="5.309">districts that they hadn&amp;#39;t had somebody</text>
  <text start="617.31" dur="5.399">well-placed and in those 39 districts</text>
  <text start="619.949" dur="4.411">some of those they ended up having some</text>
  <text start="622.709" dur="4.171">people run in those districts but they</text>
  <text start="624.36" dur="4.62">weren&amp;#39;t financed they weren&amp;#39;t given</text>
  <text start="626.88" dur="5.459">support staff essentially they were</text>
  <text start="628.98" dur="6.66">handed over so the fact that that Trump</text>
  <text start="632.339" dur="7.201">I believe the globalist plan was Trump</text>
  <text start="635.64" dur="7.68">was gonna lose 60 to 70 to 80 House</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="5.159">seats and we all know election night</text>
  <text start="643.32" dur="3.18">right mm-hmm</text>

  <text start="941.19" dur="5.07">what it did is it set the stage for</text>
  <text start="942.99" dur="6.03">files so this was all coordinated this</text>
  <text start="946.26" dur="6">is all a little dance going up and at</text>
  <text start="949.02" dur="4.92">9:30 all of a sudden they come back from</text>

  <text start="957.09" dur="4.65">a sudden all of a sudden they come out</text>
  <text start="958.8" dur="5.28">and he said 9:30 the Dems big banner the</text>
  <text start="961.74" dur="6.21">Dems have won the house at the time</text>
  <text start="964.08" dur="8.22">Dustin they needed 23 seats they were up</text>

  <text start="979.68" dur="6.09">on well uh and it&amp;#39;s interesting because</text>
  <text start="984.21" dur="3">Lou Dobbs who actually I think is a</text>
  <text start="985.77" dur="3.36">straight shooter he&amp;#39;s the only guy I</text>
  <text start="987.21" dur="3.27">think on Fox who and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="989.13" dur="3.87">because he&amp;#39;s older and he can kind of</text>
  <text start="990.48" dur="4.26">let it fly but all of a sudden Lou Dobbs</text>
  <text start="993" dur="3.48">says wait a minute what what&amp;#39;s this all</text>
  <text start="994.74" dur="5.33">about what are they doing back there</text>
  <text start="996.48" dur="6.57">well why are they calling this at 9:30</text>
  <text start="1000.07" dur="4.6">because we were just talking about this</text>
  <text start="1003.05" dur="3.96">and everything was really close what</text>
  <text start="1004.67" dur="3.33">happened in the last two minutes well</text>
  <text start="1007.01" dur="2.1">let me tell you what I think would</text>
  <text start="1008" dur="3.09">happen in the last two minutes because</text>
  <text start="1009.11" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s cuz previously I had some</text>
  <text start="1011.09" dur="5.43">experience being on some Fox shows and a</text>
  <text start="1014.06" dur="4.89">number of shows in the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1016.52" dur="5.43">at least many years ago and I still have</text>
  <text start="1018.95" dur="5.67">contacts there he said what what this</text>
  <text start="1021.95" dur="4.65">this was pure voter suppression because</text>
  <text start="1024.62" dur="4.74">by getting it out at 9:30</text>
  <text start="1026.6" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s 6:30 Pacific time polls were</text>

  <text start="1032.12" dur="6.45">half hours and and there were a number</text>
  <text start="1036.17" dur="4.56">of people that I believe the Dems wanted</text>
  <text start="1038.57" dur="3.48">to get rid of and prevent from coming</text>
  <text start="1040.73" dur="3.66">back into office such as dana</text>
  <text start="1042.05" dur="4.05">rohrabacher who ended up losing his and</text>
  <text start="1044.39" dur="4.94">I believe that guy they were really</text>
  <text start="1046.1" dur="6.09">targeted but they didn&amp;#39;t get was Nunez I</text>
  <text start="1049.33" dur="4.99">believe they were targeting Nunez with</text>
  <text start="1052.19" dur="4.08">what they did here along with several</text>
  <text start="1054.32" dur="3.96">other Senate races right because the</text>

  <text start="1067.24" dur="3.98">independence</text>
  <text start="1068.96" dur="5.38">libertarians might be watching Fox so</text>
  <text start="1071.22" dur="6.75">they directed their their weapon here if</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="6">you will it add people to try to</text>
  <text start="1077.97" dur="6.12">suppress their votes so people might say</text>

  <text start="1561.79" dur="6.93">to look at it is that you know Trump&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1566.17" dur="5.76">smart guy and the people around him are</text>
  <text start="1568.72" dur="5.42">smart and I think what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>

  <text start="1597.76" dur="4.08">like on the on the one side it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1599.65" dur="2.519">we&amp;#39;re we can fill it in saying we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1619.869" dur="4.711">investigations you know first it was a</text>
  <text start="1622.299" dur="3.87">red wave and then it was or a blue wave</text>
  <text start="1624.58" dur="2.729">and then it was a red Ripple I think it</text>
  <text start="1626.169" dur="3.96">was a red undertow</text>
  <text start="1627.309" dur="5.46">I think it was as you said giving them</text>

  <text start="1750.769" dur="6.241">needed a ride to the polls okay and the</text>
  <text start="1755.6" dur="4.079">reason is is because they had been</text>

  <text start="1826.159" dur="8.281">ago and and I and I actually think</text>
  <text start="1831.44" dur="5.729">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happened you know back in</text>
  <text start="1834.44" dur="5.64">the 60s right when Kennedy won his</text>

  <text start="1857.96" dur="8.309">elections and I truly believe one of the</text>
  <text start="1861.59" dur="8.35">reasons why Trump and his team have let</text>
  <text start="1866.269" dur="8.41">the globalists fish run with the line</text>
  <text start="1869.94" dur="8.15">is to make it obvious to everybody what</text>

  <text start="2239.92" dur="6.21">politics and the religion at dinner and</text>
  <text start="2242.77" dur="6.18">my only response about is you know most</text>
  <text start="2246.13" dur="6.33">of us if not all of us don&amp;#39;t want war or</text>
  <text start="2248.95" dur="5.85">or conflict but if it has to happen and</text>
  <text start="2252.46" dur="3.93">it does we&amp;#39;d rather I&amp;#39;d rather at least</text>
  <text start="2254.8" dur="5.58">happen in my time than my children&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2256.39" dur="9.69">time yeah so the women in my family my</text>

  <text start="2271.729" dur="8.1">they they they love conflict and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2278.029" dur="9.72">it&amp;#39;s very interesting when we get into</text>
  <text start="2279.829" dur="10.53">these discussions and they opened my</text>
  <text start="2287.749" dur="4.651">eyes in many respects and I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="2290.359" dur="5.281">think I at least open them there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2292.4" dur="7.829">a little bit but one of the things that</text>
  <text start="2295.64" dur="7.559">I have found is that when we start</text>
  <text start="2300.229" dur="8.52">talking about the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="2303.199" dur="11.721">globalist syndicate it&amp;#39;s in and maybe</text>
  <text start="2308.749" dur="8.941">it&amp;#39;s just who I am exposed to but women</text>
  <text start="2314.92" dur="9.309">when I present issues like that women</text>
  <text start="2317.69" dur="11.129">tend to for some reason they tend to be</text>
  <text start="2324.229" dur="7.77">more open to this hey wait a minute</text>
  <text start="2328.819" dur="7.89">something&amp;#39;s not right mm-hmm okay and</text>
  <text start="2331.999" dur="8.1">and a lot of guys I&amp;#39;m around are the</text>
  <text start="2336.709" dur="6.03">ones that blow me the most grief about</text>
  <text start="2340.099" dur="6.331">tape do you do you really believe</text>
  <text start="2342.739" dur="9.51">there&amp;#39;s a deep state do you you really</text>
  <text start="2346.43" dur="7.799">and and I actually and maybe it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2352.249" dur="7.8">the women I&amp;#39;m around in my life but they</text>
  <text start="2354.229" dur="11.61">actually are the ones that when they</text>
  <text start="2360.049" dur="10.28">hear about this they tend to investigate</text>
  <text start="2365.839" dur="10.01">it and they might not buy into all of it</text>
  <text start="2370.329" dur="11.44">but they don&amp;#39;t just close it off hmm so</text>
  <text start="2375.849" dur="9.311">you know III look at where we are with</text>
  <text start="2381.769" dur="5.94">this enlightenment issue of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2385.16" dur="5.399">really happening and this is where I</text>
  <text start="2387.709" dur="4.951">think you come in where I try to come in</text>
  <text start="2390.559" dur="6.871">where a number of like Sara West walk</text>
  <text start="2392.66" dur="7.79">west all comes in people are gravitating</text>
  <text start="2397.43" dur="5.99">more to</text>
  <text start="2400.45" dur="5.1">an openness of listening to this what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2403.42" dur="3.84">really going on with the deep state with</text>
  <text start="2405.55" dur="6.15">the globalist syndicate their existence</text>
  <text start="2407.26" dur="6.569">and what they&amp;#39;re doing better today than</text>
  <text start="2411.7" dur="5.25">they were five years ago than they were</text>
  <text start="2413.829" dur="6">ten years ago and where they were 30 or</text>
  <text start="2416.95" dur="5.73">40 years ago it said I think that is</text>
  <text start="2419.829" dur="5.071">very true there does seem to be kind of</text>
  <text start="2422.68" dur="3.87">a Great Awakening and and kind of to</text>
  <text start="2424.9" dur="3.51">what you just said I mean it&amp;#39;s easier to</text>
  <text start="2426.55" dur="3.75">fool a man and then seem he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2428.41" dur="3.54">fooled if it especially if it&amp;#39;s an older</text>
  <text start="2430.3" dur="4.559">person and they have kind of set in</text>
  <text start="2431.95" dur="5.58">their ways and their egos involved</text>
  <text start="2434.859" dur="4.381">I found that younger people you know</text>
  <text start="2437.53" dur="3.21">maybe not Millennials necessarily but</text>
  <text start="2439.24" dur="3.349">younger people can be more open to the</text>
  <text start="2440.74" dur="4.8">idea that there&amp;#39;s bad things going on</text>
  <text start="2442.589" dur="4.481">but at the same point it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2445.54" dur="3.36">difficult to get them to sit still long</text>
  <text start="2447.07" dur="4.62">enough to actually go through the</text>
  <text start="2448.9" dur="5.4">details of it and I&amp;#39;m glad that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2451.69" dur="4.59">had a better experience yeah with the</text>
  <text start="2454.3" dur="5.22">the fairer sex than I have when it comes</text>
  <text start="2456.28" dur="5.069">to conflict oriented issues I have not</text>
  <text start="2459.52" dur="4.95">had too many women in my life that that</text>
  <text start="2461.349" dur="5.22">wanted to go beyond the official story</text>

  <text start="2548.69" dur="6.51">system which was a system and and she</text>
  <text start="2552.98" dur="5.25">used to teach me about it in a very very</text>
  <text start="2555.2" dur="4.92">young age about systems and she said</text>
  <text start="2558.23" dur="5.82">they they had a system that was called</text>
  <text start="2560.12" dur="5.4">socialism mmm-hmm where where everybody</text>
  <text start="2564.05" dur="2.73">kind of put everything into one thing</text>

  <text start="2590.33" dur="4.95">own land and said you produce what you</text>

  <text start="2660.68" dur="5.94">no so so that&amp;#39;s absolutely correct and</text>
  <text start="2664.73" dur="2.82">and what and what the globalists have</text>
  <text start="2666.62" dur="4.52">done and</text>
  <text start="2667.55" dur="7.83">what the deep state has done is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2671.14" dur="8.04">transformed free-market capitalism into</text>
  <text start="2675.38" dur="6.54">crony capitalism and tried to tar</text>
  <text start="2679.18" dur="6.13">free-market capitalism with the crony</text>
  <text start="2681.92" dur="4.89">capitalism brush mm-hmm name has worked</text>
  <text start="2685.31" dur="5.19">very well with my China and it has</text>
  <text start="2686.81" dur="6.51">worked unfortunately it has worked</text>
  <text start="2690.5" dur="6.93">exceedingly well and then when you have</text>
  <text start="2693.32" dur="6.66">these people in power that put on the</text>
  <text start="2697.43" dur="6.57">sheep&amp;#39;s clothing of being conservatives</text>
  <text start="2699.98" dur="6.84">and free marketers like Paul Ryan when</text>
  <text start="2704" dur="5.25">in fact they are nothing but when you</text>
  <text start="2706.82" dur="5.39">strip the sheep clothing away and</text>
  <text start="2709.25" dur="8.21">they&amp;#39;re wolves and are truly globalist</text>
  <text start="2712.21" dur="8.59">mm-hmm that are trying to if you will</text>
  <text start="2717.46" dur="9.58">change the narrative so that we look at</text>
  <text start="2720.8" dur="7.86">capitalism as you say with in a manner</text>
  <text start="2727.04" dur="9.21">that I believe is not an accurate</text>
  <text start="2728.66" dur="12.24">assessment so again we comes back to it</text>
  <text start="2736.25" dur="8.04">comes back to taking the time as I said</text>
  <text start="2740.9" dur="5.76">like my mom did because I go back to</text>
  <text start="2744.29" dur="4.92">that conversation many decades ago</text>
  <text start="2746.66" dur="5.4">whenever I thinking Thanksgiving I think</text>
  <text start="2749.21" dur="6.69">of that conversation I had with her as a</text>
  <text start="2752.06" dur="6.38">first grader and that&amp;#39;s why I believe</text>
  <text start="2755.9" dur="5.22">this time of year many people say I</text>
  <text start="2758.44" dur="5.92">can&amp;#39;t talk about what&amp;#39;s happening around</text>
  <text start="2761.12" dur="6.96">the world and my family event because I</text>
  <text start="2764.36" dur="8.82">know they&amp;#39;re gonna get all upset no</text>
  <text start="2768.08" dur="8.43">maybe maybe maybe not maybe not and</text>
  <text start="2773.18" dur="7.08">maybe just that little story about what</text>
  <text start="2776.51" dur="5.82">Thanksgiving is really about the real</text>
  <text start="2780.26" dur="7.58">meaning of Thanksgiving and what really</text>
  <text start="2782.33" dur="9.18">happened in the in 1621 to 1624 in</text>
  <text start="2787.84" dur="7.18">Plymouth Massachusetts and why there was</text>
  <text start="2791.51" dur="5.91">such utter devastation the first couple</text>
  <text start="2795.02" dur="5.19">years and then why after those first</text>
  <text start="2797.42" dur="3.96">couple years there was such prosperity</text>
  <text start="2800.21" dur="8.06">and since</text>
  <text start="2801.38" dur="10.38">and life you know that&amp;#39;s a story that</text>
  <text start="2808.27" dur="9.34">that I believe should be told at every</text>
  <text start="2811.76" dur="8.73">Thanksgiving table every year mm-hmm and</text>
  <text start="2817.61" dur="4.88">and the only way we can do that and and</text>
  <text start="2820.49" dur="6.84">many people are afraid to say anything</text>
  <text start="2822.49" dur="7.27">and and they can&amp;#39;t be because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2827.33" dur="4.92">first step I believe of gaining our</text>

  <text start="2849.94" dur="7.6">mm-hmm I agree and if you don&amp;#39;t then</text>
  <text start="2854.69" dur="4.35">evil wins and the default nature of</text>

  <text start="2923.06" dur="3.72">the election fraud and everything so</text>
  <text start="2924.58" dur="3.85">what&amp;#39;s going on with I know we want to</text>
  <text start="2926.78" dur="4.02">talk about the California fires and</text>
  <text start="2928.43" dur="3.99">specifically the radiation issue because</text>

  <text start="2932.42" dur="2.49">there&amp;#39;s maybe some steps that we could</text>

  <text start="3063.4" dur="4.5">even at the retail level you know my big</text>

  <text start="3082.51" dur="4.95">difficult to do and you know back to the</text>
  <text start="3085.9" dur="3.63">point of you know I said there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3087.46" dur="5.159">lesson socialism here like Trump pointed</text>
  <text start="3089.53" dur="4.92">out just compare a public and private</text>

  <text start="3115.48" dur="7.92">land I mean you know California and what</text>
  <text start="3119.77" dur="5.67">what Jerry Brown did when he defunded</text>
  <text start="3123.4" dur="3.75">which was a hundred percent under him</text>
  <text start="3125.44" dur="4.23">the legislature legislature had voted</text>

  <text start="3132.49" dur="2.97">know they they leave four or five six</text>
  <text start="3133.96" dur="3.03">hundred percent too much fuel on the</text>

  <text start="3143.319" dur="8.28">you know so so I I&amp;#39;m at a loss to</text>
  <text start="3147.73" dur="6.78">explain what has happening is happening</text>
  <text start="3151.599" dur="4.581">in California from the fire situation</text>
  <text start="3154.51" dur="6.27">now my sources told me the following</text>
  <text start="3156.18" dur="7.929">this is two sources that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3160.78" dur="7.11">reportedly as eyewitness testimony that</text>
  <text start="3164.109" dur="9.271">the fires were initiated on four fronts</text>
  <text start="3167.89" dur="7.89">and my two sources attributed this that</text>
  <text start="3173.38" dur="7.62">this was a terrorist act it was a</text>
  <text start="3175.78" dur="7.069">coordinated terrorist act and four</text>
  <text start="3181" dur="7.109">locations that the fire were started</text>
  <text start="3182.849" dur="7.121">eyewitness testimony but those fires and</text>
  <text start="3188.109" dur="3.72">you mentioned about the leaves on the</text>
  <text start="3189.97" dur="4.74">trees are on a house that is just</text>
  <text start="3191.829" dur="4.591">incinerated this this car and not just</text>
  <text start="3194.71" dur="4.649">one right I mean there&amp;#39;s lots of houses</text>
  <text start="3196.42" dur="4.5">yeah right and in these cars I mean not</text>
  <text start="3199.359" dur="4.291">just we&amp;#39;re not just talking like one car</text>
  <text start="3200.92" dur="9.61">that the aluminum in my</text>
  <text start="3203.65" dur="10.78">and and it can&amp;#39;t be explained I think</text>
  <text start="3210.53" dur="6.78">completely by a massive fire that was</text>
  <text start="3214.43" dur="5.76">just had tremendous winds behind it and</text>
  <text start="3217.31" dur="7.559">we&amp;#39;re sweeping through that doesn&amp;#39;t add</text>
  <text start="3220.19" dur="6.75">up on the car issues and on the leaves</text>
  <text start="3224.869" dur="5.49">not even being singed around a house</text>
  <text start="3226.94" dur="6.81">that&amp;#39;s incinerated mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="3230.359" dur="5.731">and I did not have any confirmation from</text>
  <text start="3233.75" dur="6.06">any of my sources about the utilization</text>
  <text start="3236.09" dur="6.15">of direct energy weapons so none of them</text>
  <text start="3239.81" dur="4.5">confirm that none of them I asked them</text>
  <text start="3242.24" dur="4.05">they said you know what we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="3244.31" dur="2.4">don&amp;#39;t have any confirmation of that at</text>
  <text start="3246.29" dur="2.579">all</text>
  <text start="3246.71" dur="4.2">now usually those sources are pretty if</text>
  <text start="3248.869" dur="4.771">there&amp;#39;s something like that I mean if</text>
  <text start="3250.91" dur="5.34">they know they tell me and they always</text>
  <text start="3253.64" dur="4.44">haven&amp;#39;t passed they didn&amp;#39;t they said</text>
  <text start="3256.25" dur="3.57">that they had know that they had no</text>
  <text start="3258.08" dur="4.26">knowledge of that and that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3259.82" dur="3.9">have any inkling that that was involved</text>
  <text start="3262.34" dur="3.2">on the other hand they said well how do</text>
  <text start="3263.72" dur="6.11">you explain the car thing in the tree</text>
  <text start="3265.54" dur="9.01">and they said we can&amp;#39;t mm-hmm you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3269.83" dur="6.58">I do believe the tinderboxes were</text>
  <text start="3274.55" dur="5.7">creation of a Forestry Service</text>
  <text start="3276.41" dur="5.34">and of the brown administration and and</text>
  <text start="3280.25" dur="4.32">if you want to call it negligence or</text>
  <text start="3281.75" dur="4.65">mismanagement I would I would just say</text>
  <text start="3284.57" dur="3.51">government any time not even just in</text>
  <text start="3286.4" dur="3.48">this one-off situation this is a great</text>

  <text start="3289.88" dur="3.6">managing the public resources they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3291.71" dur="4.23">going to do so badly there&amp;#39;s a lesson to</text>
  <text start="3293.48" dur="4.65">be learned here for sure they&amp;#39;re also</text>

  <text start="3910.86" dur="5.47">poisonous right this is I use lugol&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3914.14" dur="4.83">iodine which is a great recipe anyone</text>
  <text start="3916.33" dur="4.44">can DIY themselves it&amp;#39;s very simple and</text>
  <text start="3918.97" dur="3.27">there are some other forms like nascent</text>

  <text start="3923.86" dur="7.56">experts in the field yeah and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3926.62" dur="6.36">look the the downside of if I lived in</text>
  <text start="3931.42" dur="10.95">this area that we were just speaking</text>
  <text start="3932.98" dur="10.95">about I would be taking iodine I mean</text>
  <text start="3942.37" dur="6.06">you take it on a daily basis</text>
  <text start="3943.93" dur="7.41">I don&amp;#39;t but that I maybe I think I</text>
  <text start="3948.43" dur="6.62">better start but but the bottom line is</text>
  <text start="3951.34" dur="7.92">is that from a prevention standpoint</text>
  <text start="3955.05" dur="6.01">based on the potential Errol Errol is</text>

  <text start="3961.06" dur="7.05">time saying it yeah right</text>
  <text start="3964.06" dur="6.93">the I think that it&amp;#39;s the prudent thing</text>
