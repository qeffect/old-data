  <text start="226.35" dur="7.02">people brought up Iran so what&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="5.19">to happen with Iran I imagine is some</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="4.77">sort of a war posture or war action or</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="4.41">at least a real attempt to start</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="5.52">something but I hope that POTUS will</text>
  <text start="240.72" dur="5.37">prevent it because you know I reported</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="3.21">earlier today China and Russia and all</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="2.64">of them are sort of</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="3.449">I ran sighed at this point so this is a</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="4.64">World War 3 scenario we can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="250.319" dur="6.57">invade Iran now I don&amp;#39;t know if if that</text>
  <text start="253.37" dur="5.679">how far they are willing to go to really</text>
  <text start="256.889" dur="4.051">back Iran out but they&amp;#39;re making all the</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="3.601">right moves to say we&amp;#39;re on their team</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="7.199">don&amp;#39;t mess with them live long</text>
  <text start="262.65" dur="6.75">right so oh yeah my audio I apologize</text>
  <text start="268.139" dur="4.201">let me get that clipped on</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="5.1">I always forget the new tech so we also</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="5.67">have the fact that Iran just abandoned</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="6.9">the US dollar the Federal Reserve dollar</text>
  <text start="278.01" dur="5.37">the the fiat currency note central bank</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="3.299">currency of the world basically the the</text>
  <text start="283.38" dur="4.86">central standard currency of the world</text>
  <text start="284.699" dur="6.72">so that alone is enough generally</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="4.92">speaking to get you Gadhafi that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="291.419" dur="4.051">happened with Gaddafi in fact he was</text>
  <text start="293.16" dur="5.16">taking Olivia to a gold standard and had</text>
  <text start="295.47" dur="4.11">the wealth to do so and you know he may</text>
  <text start="298.32" dur="2.879">not have been a perfect guy but he was</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="4.589">helping his people living in a tent you</text>
  <text start="301.199" dur="5.041">know and helping his people and he was a</text>
  <text start="304.169" dur="4.771">hero to them and then we get we get off</text>
  <text start="306.24" dur="4.02">eat him and murdered him because he was</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="3">trying to take people away from the</text>
  <text start="310.26" dur="4.2">dollar that&amp;#39;s how serious this is</text>
  <text start="311.94" dur="4.86">because guys when the dollar loses its</text>
  <text start="314.46" dur="4.47">reserve status everyone here who&amp;#39;s had</text>
  <text start="316.8" dur="4.5">that fat happy lifestyle is not gonna</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="5.4">have it anymore it&amp;#39;s gonna be hard for a</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.71">while now I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="324.33" dur="3.18">to war over it because this is gonna</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="3.9">happen anyway there&amp;#39;s nothing that can</text>
  <text start="327.51" dur="5.45">prevent it because of what&amp;#39;s happened</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="5.7">recently especially Russia and China and</text>
  <text start="332.96" dur="4.239">you know now Europe and in the trade</text>
  <text start="335.61" dur="4.41">wars and everybody&amp;#39;s mad at Trump sawr</text>
  <text start="337.199" dur="4.47">POTUS I can&amp;#39;t say is I can&amp;#39;t say Trump I</text>
  <text start="340.02" dur="3.48">have to say mr. tweet everyone&amp;#39;s mad at</text>
  <text start="341.669" dur="3.481">mr. tweet and America because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.5" dur="3.449">actually standing up for that for us so</text>
  <text start="345.15" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re all gonna just go the other way</text>
  <text start="346.949" dur="5.641">and use it as a way to spite him or a</text>
  <text start="348.78" dur="7.199">weapon to punish us and we will get</text>
  <text start="352.59" dur="5.84">through that but the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="355.979" dur="5.31">is probably coming sooner than you think</text>
  <text start="358.43" dur="5.14">people who don&amp;#39;t have any silver you</text>
  <text start="361.289" dur="3.931">know here&amp;#39;s the thing you know I eat</text>

  <text start="367.11" dur="4.529">course but the food supply is so scarce</text>
  <text start="369.419" dur="3.481">so few people understand how to grow</text>
  <text start="371.639" dur="2.761">their own food when we have the Great</text>

  <text start="449.16" dur="4.32">book here I like to use the book as the</text>
  <text start="450.99" dur="4.44">lead-in because that was the that was</text>
  <text start="453.48" dur="5.31">the initial proof of concept and and</text>
  <text start="455.43" dur="6.239">funny enough it was amazing success but</text>
  <text start="458.79" dur="4.71">the real the real success not was not</text>
  <text start="461.669" dur="3.75">how it was a best-seller or anything but</text>
  <text start="463.5" dur="4.169">how it really showed that when we come</text>
  <text start="465.419" dur="4.441">together as a team influencers within</text>

  <text start="492.09" dur="5.94">not with 12 but with a hundred</text>
  <text start="494.01" dur="9.72">influencers that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="8.13">next oh it&amp;#39;s too late to stop it Sam</text>
  <text start="503.73" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;ve already kind of I pre baked in some</text>
  <text start="506.16" dur="3.45">of the some of these things because I</text>
  <text start="507.66" dur="3.54">understood first of all there&amp;#39;s no way I</text>
  <text start="509.61" dur="3.65">could keep a secret because I&amp;#39;m not that</text>
  <text start="511.2" dur="3.59">tech anyway so I don&amp;#39;t even try</text>
  <text start="513.26" dur="3.84">I have my tech people will handle that</text>
  <text start="514.79" dur="4.35">stuff but anything that is really secret</text>
  <text start="517.1" dur="5.28">in my mind it&amp;#39;ll never come out until</text>
  <text start="519.14" dur="5.64">the timing is right but what I did was I</text>
  <text start="522.38" dur="3.63">networked many influencers and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="4.02">talked to a lot of people behind the</text>
  <text start="526.01" dur="4.92">scenes I started building a dozen</text>
  <text start="528.8" dur="3.66">startups I started to do a bunch of big</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="2.88">things behind the spinning</text>
  <text start="532.46" dur="5.61">six hundred seven hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="533.81" dur="5.49">dollars a year I think actually you</text>
  <text start="538.07" dur="3.66">would not even believe what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="539.3" dur="4.11">behind the scenes I&amp;#39;m telling you guys</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="5.87">there&amp;#39;s a whole team now working to</text>
  <text start="543.41" dur="7.2">replace big tech to replace Big Pharma&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.6" dur="6.37">profits with real cures with real</text>
  <text start="550.61" dur="4.92">research and funding I I told you guys</text>
  <text start="553.97" dur="4.02">if I ever got anywhere in the world</text>
  <text start="555.53" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to kill me or talk to</text>
  <text start="557.99" dur="4.05">me because I will change this thing and</text>
  <text start="560.33" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m doing that not because of me but</text>
  <text start="562.04" dur="5.07">simply because we have a heck of a team</text>
  <text start="564.47" dur="4.35">and if we just kind of work together a</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="4.95">little bit we can do some amazing things</text>
  <text start="568.82" dur="5.55">so the book was one example the next</text>
  <text start="572.06" dur="4.35">project is of course censorship because</text>
  <text start="574.37" dur="6.18">what else we don&amp;#39;t win there we lose</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="8.28">everything and that means stop bit</text>
  <text start="580.55" dur="6.87">burning calm stop it burning calm is</text>
  <text start="584.69" dur="4.5">going to be and by the way that&amp;#39;s a noon</text>
  <text start="587.42" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s a new word bit burning is a whole</text>
  <text start="589.19" dur="6.12">new word we we coined that word so stop</text>
  <text start="592.04" dur="5.37">it burning calm is your anti censorship</text>
  <text start="595.31" dur="4.8">movement is your free speech versus big</text>
  <text start="597.41" dur="8.85">tech movement and where you&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="600.11" dur="8.22">updates and things like that so that one</text>
  <text start="606.26" dur="4.35">is the next step after that it will be</text>
  <text start="608.33" dur="4.23">the white hat movement which is pretty</text>
  <text start="610.61" dur="3.93">much the same thing except for stop it</text>

  <text start="1569.62" dur="5.88">flashlights they buy it from you people</text>
  <text start="1572.23" dur="5.13">are struggling you tap into certain you</text>

  <text start="1617.84" dur="6.15">try my best you know - I&amp;#39;m networking</text>
  <text start="1622.22" dur="3.63">most of these people personally at first</text>
  <text start="1623.99" dur="3.48">so I&amp;#39;m inviting them in personally and</text>
  <text start="1625.85" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m not going to bad people to invite</text>
  <text start="1627.47" dur="4.41">them and anyone who&amp;#39;s been censored this</text>
  <text start="1629.99" dur="3.659">is not a place that I&amp;#39;m gonna start</text>
  <text start="1631.88" dur="4.289">banning people from or something anyone</text>

  <text start="1636.169" dur="3.931">not going to control which alt media are</text>
  <text start="1638.029" dur="3.951">gonna be successful based on this the</text>
  <text start="1640.1" dur="4.079">the marketplace is going to control that</text>
  <text start="1641.98" dur="4.87">because their audience would be the ones</text>
  <text start="1644.179" dur="4.62">that support them so I&amp;#39;m basically</text>
  <text start="1646.85" dur="5.13">giving you a way to monetize your</text>
  <text start="1648.799" dur="5.671">audience without asking them to spend</text>
  <text start="1651.98" dur="4.26">additional money in donations in a much</text>
  <text start="1654.47" dur="4.939">better way and using it to destroy big</text>
  <text start="1656.24" dur="6.389">tech and build what I call big Patriot</text>
  <text start="1659.409" dur="4.99">so you know we take down big tech we</text>
  <text start="1662.629" dur="3.42">take away some of that quarter for every</text>
  <text start="1664.399" dur="4.051">dollar on the internet spent from Amazon</text>
  <text start="1666.049" dur="3.99">and we switched that over to the good</text>

  <text start="1676.61" dur="4.98">business model to fund the creation of</text>
  <text start="1678.919" dur="5.581">the new Internet the free people centric</text>
  <text start="1681.59" dur="4.829">privacy centric internet called big</text>
  <text start="1684.5" dur="4.5">Patriot just kind of a joke working name</text>
  <text start="1686.419" dur="4.441">but you know because we build big</text>

  <text start="2961.69" dur="3.93">know you&amp;#39;re having to get rid of rocks</text>
