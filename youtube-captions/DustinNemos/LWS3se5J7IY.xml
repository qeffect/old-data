  <text start="30.23" dur="6.46">members of the Hollywood sex cult nexium</text>
  <text start="33.57" dur="5.73">hosted seminars and lavish sex parties</text>
  <text start="36.69" dur="4.65">on Richard Branson&amp;#39;s private Caribbean</text>
  <text start="39.3" dur="4.579">island in a bid to recruit the</text>
  <text start="41.34" dur="5.19">billionaire according to a whistleblower</text>
  <text start="43.879" dur="5.291">so now we have possible connections</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="4.709">between Obama and the nexium group which</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="4.5">also may tie into Bill Clinton and</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="4.291">Epstein through Branson convicted</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="3.479">pedophile Jeffrey Epstein had Branson</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="3.509">and though Clinton listed among his</text>
  <text start="57.149" dur="4.921">contacts in his little black book and</text>
  <text start="59.039" dur="5.041">his private island known as orgy island</text>
  <text start="62.07" dur="5.24">is less than 40 miles away from Necker</text>
  <text start="64.08" dur="5.61">Island within the Virgin Islands cluster</text>
  <text start="67.31" dur="4.78">and I think this Richard Branson guy is</text>
  <text start="69.69" dur="7.44">like the Virgin CEO or something like</text>
  <text start="72.09" dur="6.48">that and Project Veritas has done it</text>
  <text start="77.13" dur="3.51">again they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve actually went</text>
  <text start="78.57" dur="6.839">undercover and caught a New Jersey</text>
  <text start="80.64" dur="9.18">teachers union president covering up</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="6.6">child abuse in schools even even so far</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="4.229">on the on video just real blatant even</text>
  <text start="92.009" dur="4.65">going so far as to saying been the truth</text>
  <text start="94.049" dur="4.86">to protect abuse I mean he really said</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="5.521">been the truth yeah I&amp;#39;ve watched it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="98.909" dur="6.181">pretty crazy but it&amp;#39;s definitely worth a</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="5.009">watch in fact later on James O&amp;#39;Keefe</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="4.349">himself of Project Veritas confronted</text>
  <text start="107.189" dur="5.131">the guy and got that on camera</text>
  <text start="109.439" dur="4.11">also so I&amp;#39;ve got these two links here</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="4.909">and I&amp;#39;ll have them in the description</text>
  <text start="113.549" dur="3.68">below if you want to check it out and</text>
  <text start="118.25" dur="6.039">the Nasdaq look at this this is kind of</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="6.24">a big deal but not really being seen as</text>
  <text start="124.289" dur="6.301">a big deal by many the Nasdaq may become</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="4.56">a crypto exchange I mean the president</text>
  <text start="130.59" dur="3.99">of Nasdaq actually said that like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="5.37">interested in impossibly pursuing them</text>
  <text start="134.58" dur="6.299">so this is just a sign of how really</text>
  <text start="137.49" dur="5.07">massive things are in that area if</text>
  <text start="140.879" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re ignoring crypto and you</text>
  <text start="142.56" dur="3.66">think it won&amp;#39;t go anywhere I urge you to</text>
  <text start="144.959" dur="3.831">reconsider</text>
  <text start="146.22" dur="4.95">maybe maybe gets a fresh perspective</text>
  <text start="148.79" dur="4.42">taking the new information available</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="6.12">because this field is really going</text>
  <text start="153.21" dur="7.08">somewhere and that said I&amp;#39;ve got some</text>
  <text start="157.29" dur="5.28">stuff on my website at Dustin Nemo&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.29" dur="4.11">calm about kryptos and just a couple</text>
  <text start="162.57" dur="6.08">videos you can go through on the crypto</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="4.25">page to learn a little bit more about it</text>
  <text start="168.83" dur="6.7">us TR a light Heiser I&amp;#39;m saying that</text>
  <text start="172.53" dur="6.3">right tells us Chamber of Commerce NAFTA</text>
  <text start="175.53" dur="6.24">is on thin ice so this ambassador</text>
  <text start="178.83" dur="5.25">comments on NAFTA prior to departing for</text>
  <text start="181.77" dur="5.16">China in the auto sector of Mexico in</text>
  <text start="184.08" dur="5.91">Canada are still arguing for more Asian</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="5.58">and Chinese parts for US automobiles so</text>
  <text start="189.99" dur="6.63">the u.s. position is for higher North</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="5.82">American content so obviously they want</text>
  <text start="196.62" dur="5.64">Asian Goods we want to build our own</text>
  <text start="198.33" dur="6.47">goods and how it works is is their</text>
  <text start="202.26" dur="6.09">economy is basically running as a</text>
  <text start="204.8" dur="5.59">brokering house and they&amp;#39;re just pushing</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="5.1">the cheap asian goods from from china</text>
  <text start="210.39" dur="6.42">through through their nafta open borders</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="6.57">trade deals and flooding our market with</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="4.83">all these cheap goods that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="220.02" dur="3.24">what they want to maintain and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="7.08">something that really screws us we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="7.949">want that so President Trump actually</text>
  <text start="228.72" dur="4.77">came out and threatened to use his</text>
  <text start="231.209" dur="5.101">presidential powers to and to get</text>
  <text start="233.49" dur="6.06">involved after the DOJ once again</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="4.86">stonewalled the houses House GOP efforts</text>
  <text start="239.55" dur="2.55">to obtain key documents about the</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="3.78">Mueller witch hunt</text>
  <text start="242.1" dur="5.43">this week the DOJ refused to hand over</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="5.28">to Congress the unredacted Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="5.64">memo detailing the scope of Miller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="4.62">probe so Rosenstein is really kind of</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="4.14">bucking the authority lately and he is</text>
  <text start="254.85" dur="5.97">he is painting a big target on his back</text>
  <text start="257.31" dur="6.22">and Trump is eyeing that target</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="6.64">it&amp;#39;s really easy to hate the man because</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="6.09">he&amp;#39;s just blatantly blatantly biased</text>
  <text start="267.46" dur="4.86">blatantly pursuing a witch-hunt just so</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="7.35">many conflicts of interest so much</text>
  <text start="272.32" dur="6.09">corruption in his own past and that</text>
  <text start="276.97" dur="5.16">might mean nuke you in the background</text>
  <text start="278.41" dur="6.6">there I don&amp;#39;t know let&amp;#39;s see Schumer</text>
  <text start="282.13" dur="5.94">actually responds to Trump and says do</text>
  <text start="285.01" dur="6.54">not go down this road you know real</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="5.7">blatant kind of a won&amp;#39;t go so far as to</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="6.989">say threat but definitely a blatant</text>
  <text start="293.77" dur="7.44">warning and in a significant escalation</text>
  <text start="298.539" dur="5.611">of the trade war with China okay this is</text>
  <text start="301.21" dur="5.13">somewhat significant I would say that</text>
  <text start="304.15" dur="4.049">was their wording the White House is</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="3.78">considering restricting telecom</text>
  <text start="308.199" dur="4.321">equipment sales by some Chinese</text>
  <text start="310.12" dur="4.859">companies in the u.s. even as Chinese</text>
  <text start="312.52" dur="4.679">officials warned that quote in the event</text>
  <text start="314.979" dur="6.69">of a trade war China has a much greater</text>
  <text start="317.199" dur="10.381">ability to endure than the u.s. I would</text>
  <text start="321.669" dur="7.951">say yes and no so on the yes side most</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="5.19">Chinese families are still in abject</text>
  <text start="329.62" dur="5.1">poverty and they can just go right back</text>
  <text start="332.77" dur="4.94">to how not having any electricity and</text>
  <text start="334.72" dur="6.02">they&amp;#39;ll be fine and over here we are a</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="7.54">obese out-of-shape</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="7.45">spoiled rotten race of people in the US</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="5.669">and and that&amp;#39;s you know I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="348.19" dur="4.349">fair comment not all of us there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.919" dur="4.56">exceptions to the rules everything else</text>
  <text start="352.539" dur="4.681">but you know as a society where we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="355.479" dur="6.781">that late stage of being kind of</text>
  <text start="357.22" dur="6.33">decadent and and and dis spoiled that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="362.26" dur="2.73">the best sort of the downfall of</text>
  <text start="363.55" dur="5.01">capitalism which we actually had a</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="5.67">little bit of that early on we create so</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="6.18">much wealth that our children then</text>
  <text start="370.66" dur="5.819">become spoiled wrecks that is the that</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="3.84">is the threat of capitalism we have to</text>
  <text start="376.479" dur="5.611">find a way around that but it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="8.369">the best system out there anyway so yeah</text>
  <text start="382.09" dur="6.96">I think the Chinese people would would</text>
  <text start="386.949" dur="4.5">have somewhat of an advantage in a</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="3.6">mindset going into that you know if</text>
  <text start="391.449" dur="2.731">everybody is just suffering and</text>
  <text start="392.65" dur="5.31">everybody&amp;#39;s poorer for it they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="394.18" dur="6">be more used to that we do definitely</text>
  <text start="397.96" dur="4.35">have our own port here and they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="5.75">gonna be poor in fact I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="402.31" dur="3.62">coming is gonna hurt them the most but</text>
  <text start="406.05" dur="4.179">anyone here who has just a tiny little</text>
  <text start="408.4" dur="4.759">bit of their lifestyle taken away would</text>
  <text start="410.229" dur="4.231">have a panic attack and flip out I think</text>
  <text start="413.159" dur="3.82">so</text>
  <text start="414.46" dur="4.739">other than that though like the</text>
  <text start="416.979" dur="4.861">fundamentals I think the US economy</text>
  <text start="419.199" dur="4.381">would be in a better position so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="421.84" dur="5.879">see China does have some big weapons</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="6.859">I&amp;#39;ve covered that before and soon after</text>
  <text start="427.719" dur="6.871">the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin</text>
  <text start="430.439" dur="7.181">Netanyahu gave a televised address in</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="6.15">which he unveiled a cache of 55,000</text>
  <text start="437.62" dur="4.349">pages of documents and 183 CDs that he</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="4.109">claimed compromised</text>
  <text start="441.969" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;m sorry comprised Iran&amp;#39;s alleged</text>
  <text start="444.849" dur="4.891">atomic archive of documents on its</text>
  <text start="447.009" dur="4.351">nuclear program supposedly proving the</text>
  <text start="449.74" dur="3.81">existence of an illegal and ongoing</text>
  <text start="451.36" dur="5.669">secret program to test and build nuclear</text>
  <text start="453.55" dur="5.549">weapons called Project Ahmad the UN&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.029" dur="4.95">atomic agency weighed in to directly</text>
  <text start="459.099" dur="5.37">negate his claims but right on cue</text>
  <text start="461.979" dur="4.92">Reuters now reports that Trump has Alba</text>
  <text start="464.469" dur="5.19">decided to withdraw from the 2015 Iran</text>
  <text start="466.899" dur="6.33">nuclear accord by May 12th but exactly</text>
  <text start="469.659" dur="5.31">how he will do so remains unclear to</text>
  <text start="473.229" dur="3.451">White House officials and a source</text>
  <text start="474.969" dur="6.741">familiar with the administration&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.68" dur="8.31">internal debate said on Wednesday so</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="5.29">Trump is playing along with the game he</text>
  <text start="484.99" dur="2.909">seems to be playing into Netanyahu&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="487" dur="3.27">hands</text>
  <text start="487.899" dur="5.311">but remember Hugh did tell us for those</text>
  <text start="490.27" dur="5.73">who were following the Qun on stuff cute</text>
  <text start="493.21" dur="5.009">did mention is real safe for last and</text>
  <text start="496" dur="4.949">there&amp;#39;s a reason for it and I think that</text>
  <text start="498.219" dur="4.861">that reason is there there on just</text>
  <text start="500.949" dur="4.65">amazing amount of influence over our</text>
  <text start="503.08" dur="4.41">government I think that is probably the</text>
  <text start="505.599" dur="4.021">reason that the cue is saving them for</text>
  <text start="507.49" dur="3.36">last because that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="509.62" dur="6.9">bigger fight</text>
  <text start="510.85" dur="7.379">and the this is sad the eighth the</text>
  <text start="516.52" dur="3.45">majority of eighth graders and public</text>
  <text start="518.229" dur="7.621">schools are not proficient in a reading</text>
  <text start="519.97" dur="7.56">or math this is a this is a far down the</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="3.48">line you&amp;#39;ve already let the government</text>
  <text start="527.53" dur="4.41">get into education you&amp;#39;ve already left</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="4.92">the Marxist and communist completely</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="5.31">revamp the education into a Marxist</text>
  <text start="534.25" dur="5.34">propaganda outlet ruining children</text>
  <text start="537.25" dur="4.29">churning out terrible broken adults that</text>
  <text start="539.59" dur="5.13">will then go through society and cause</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="5.4">problems and and be angry and entitled</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="4.56">and fall for race baiting and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="546.94" dur="3.69">just like a collective gunk moving</text>
  <text start="549.28" dur="5.67">through the arteries of the human</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="7.02">population for generations because</text>
  <text start="554.95" dur="7.01">broken people tend to breed broken</text>
  <text start="557.65" dur="9.18">people just my personal opinion about it</text>
  <text start="561.96" dur="7.57">so you know this this is a problem when</text>
  <text start="566.83" dur="8.25">too much of the population gets into</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="7.17">this sort of lower vibration State you</text>
  <text start="575.08" dur="3.27">know not exposed to a lot of truth not</text>
  <text start="576.7" dur="3.42">exposed to a lot of empathy not exposed</text>
  <text start="578.35" dur="3.93">to a lot of real education exposed to a</text>
  <text start="580.12" dur="3.69">lot of propaganda a lot of Marxism a lot</text>
  <text start="582.28" dur="5.67">of hatred a lot of anger a lot of</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="5.97">identity politics and and victim culture</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="6.21">and and they&amp;#39;re just raised that way</text>
  <text start="589.78" dur="5.85">and you know famous tyrants have said I</text>
  <text start="594.16" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t remember which one it was Lenin or</text>
  <text start="595.63" dur="6.27">somebody but if you give me a child for</text>
  <text start="599.53" dur="4.62">five years you&amp;#39;ll never uproot the seed</text>
  <text start="601.9" dur="4.26">that I plant something like that and</text>
  <text start="604.15" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s absolutely true and the Marx has</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="5.48">completely understand if you can target</text>
  <text start="607.96" dur="5.88">the youth and and propagandize the youth</text>
  <text start="611.64" dur="3.46">you can use them to overthrow the</text>
