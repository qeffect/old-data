  <text start="230.31" dur="6.64">Robbie looked like he was hit by a bus</text>
  <text start="234.3" dur="6.55">Robbie from that moment on had a stunned</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="7.11">look on his face if you asked or said</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="5.16">his name he still acted defin and acted</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="3.75">like he couldn&amp;#39;t hear although they did</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="4.949">have normal hearing I had it all tested</text>
  <text start="247.81" dur="4.43">but he lost his happiness this is a</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="4.731">first</text>
  <text start="252.24" dur="5.52">um first year picture first birthday</text>
  <text start="255.69" dur="4.14">three months after the show three months</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="6.24">after the shot they were no longer</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="8.99">engaged in anything or anyone they lost</text>
  <text start="264" dur="7.92">their smiles they they just were um in</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="5.71">their own little separate worlds they</text>
  <text start="271.92" dur="11.64">never held hands again and never looked</text>
  <text start="274.53" dur="12.53">at each other again vaccine injury is</text>
  <text start="283.56" dur="6.06">real we were told it was genetic and</text>
  <text start="287.06" dur="4.9">then we were told by geneticist that</text>
  <text start="289.62" dur="5.13">there&amp;#39;s no possible way three children</text>
  <text start="291.96" dur="4.89">we shut off on the same day that that</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="5.45">was absolutely statistically impossible</text>
  <text start="296.85" dur="6.6">especially being two boys and one girl</text>
  <text start="300.2" dur="5.53">so we were also told we could not sue</text>
  <text start="303.45" dur="5.66">anyone we were told we sign for that</text>
  <text start="305.73" dur="6.72">shot no doctors could be sued no vaccine</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="5.74">manufacturers could be sued and we found</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="4.47">out when they were five and a half that</text>
  <text start="314.85" dur="3.48">there was a vaccine injury court when we</text>
  <text start="316.92" dur="3.15">I think we&amp;#39;re all getting smartphones</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="4.2">around them that&amp;#39;s when we you know I</text>
  <text start="320.07" dur="5.43">had it at my pocket and started googling</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="4.8">everything and they then told us that we</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="5.61">were too late they only had three years</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="6.84">to apply so we have spent hundreds of</text>
  <text start="331.11" dur="8.42">thousands of dollars trying to recover</text>
  <text start="334.17" dur="8.67">them the only person that we got back is</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="5.17">the one that was last to shut off we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="342.84" dur="6.53">making progress in all we are making</text>
  <text start="344.7" dur="7.53">progress so we had severe autism</text>
  <text start="349.37" dur="4.78">spectrum disorder for all three kids</text>
  <text start="352.23" dur="4.29">entering kindergarten that&amp;#39;s how long</text>
  <text start="354.15" dur="5.27">that severe even with all the therapies</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.7">interventions you name it we did it we</text>
  <text start="359.42" dur="4.84">decided to go with a sunrise therapy</text>
  <text start="362.22" dur="5.58">which was to try and find happiness in</text>
  <text start="364.26" dur="5.91">our day and we have happy little people</text>
  <text start="367.8" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re not mean they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="370.17" dur="5.15">aggressive they&amp;#39;re very happy and I</text>
  <text start="371.94" dur="5.91">attribute that to the sunrise therapy</text>
  <text start="375.32" dur="5.47">but we still have a long ways to go</text>
  <text start="377.85" dur="5.21">Ritchie can only say single maybe two</text>
  <text start="380.79" dur="5.21">words together he</text>
  <text start="383.06" dur="5.88">he&amp;#39;s in a lot of pain he grinds his</text>
  <text start="386" dur="6.12">teeth he&amp;#39;s um we&amp;#39;re still working on it</text>
  <text start="388.94" dur="4.68">Claire is still completely nonverbal not</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="4.38">potty-trained Richie&amp;#39;s not fully</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="5.37">potty-trained Ravi is now and Robbie is</text>
  <text start="396.5" dur="5.85">approaching grade level but severe OCD</text>
  <text start="398.99" dur="6.21">and we&amp;#39;re coming along</text>
  <text start="402.35" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s just one day at a time uh my</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="5.31">husband wanted to kind of tell you what</text>
  <text start="406.94" dur="9.05">a day in our life can look like even you</text>
  <text start="410.51" dur="5.48">know because of huge property management</text>
  <text start="417.31" dur="5.56">let me tell you what a day in our life</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="5.34">isn&amp;#39;t so you got say a six or seven or</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="4.68">eight year old child who&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="424.7" dur="4.77">potty-trained and a two or three or four</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="3.42">o&amp;#39;clock in the morning they filled their</text>
  <text start="429.47" dur="4.65">diaper assume that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="430.97" dur="5.7">uncomfortable so they take it off soon</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="5.28">pretty soon it&amp;#39;s all over them it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="436.67" dur="5.55">over the bed in short order it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="439.4" dur="4.92">over me it&amp;#39;s all over her mm-hmm I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="442.22" dur="5.28">snapping at her she snapped at me we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.32" dur="5.58">both snapping at the kid who is the only</text>
  <text start="447.5" dur="5.01">innocent party in the whole scenario and</text>
  <text start="449.9" dur="7.71">the one thing that&amp;#39;s conspicuously</text>
  <text start="452.51" dur="7.41">absent from that scenario is is anybody</text>
  <text start="457.61" dur="5.01">who told you that shot was safe they</text>
  <text start="459.92" dur="5.03">were all asleep in their bed damn got a</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="5.4">problem in the world</text>
  <text start="464.95" dur="5.05">the hard part about that is I asked the</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="4.29">nurse we actually had to go to McComb</text>
  <text start="470" dur="4.71">Health Department to get our shots done</text>
  <text start="472.31" dur="5.16">because I did not have coverage for</text>
  <text start="474.71" dur="4.08">well-baby coverage so they said it would</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="5.4">be a little cheaper because I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="478.79" dur="6.3">three then there&amp;#39;s assured me over and</text>
  <text start="482.87" dur="3.93">over and over again it would not harm</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="4.89">them it wouldn&amp;#39;t I would so worried</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="7.26">about that and like you just said where</text>
  <text start="489.98" dur="7.05">are they no you know I am i did make a</text>
  <text start="494.06" dur="4.95">report the very next day I called the</text>
  <text start="497.03" dur="4.41">nurse I called Macomb Lee they wrote it</text>
  <text start="499.01" dur="5.91">all out and they did not submit it I</text>
  <text start="501.44" dur="5.79">found that later it was not sent in we</text>
  <text start="504.92" dur="6.24">found out seven years after we got the</text>
  <text start="507.23" dur="7.98">vaccine that it was contaminated and it</text>
  <text start="511.16" dur="6.33">was pulled from the market a week to two</text>
  <text start="515.21" dur="5.1">weeks after we got the shot so it was</text>
  <text start="517.49" dur="4.71">recalled for sterilization issues and we</text>
  <text start="520.31" dur="4.89">found out they wouldn&amp;#39;t tell us what was</text>
  <text start="522.2" dur="4.86">wrong with the shot we found out from a</text>
  <text start="525.2" dur="4.56">friend who is a doctor looked up the lot</text>
  <text start="527.06" dur="5.04">number of the actual shot and found out</text>
  <text start="529.76" dur="4.94">that it was it had killed a two-year-old</text>
  <text start="532.1" dur="5.16">and they didn&amp;#39;t want the public to know</text>
  <text start="534.7" dur="5.23">so that was the actual shot and lot</text>
  <text start="537.26" dur="5.04">number that we got and so I guess we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="3.99">lucky that we didn&amp;#39;t lose them we could</text>
  <text start="542.3" dur="7.23">have lost all three on the same day</text>
  <text start="543.92" dur="8.13">completely but they just mean why the</text>
  <text start="549.53" dur="6.9">first doctor we saw told us to invest in</text>
  <text start="552.05" dur="6.54">the group home I mean seriously the</text>
  <text start="556.43" dur="4.62">second and then we were we were given oh</text>
  <text start="558.59" dur="5.7">yeah I want to start up the vaccinations</text>
  <text start="561.05" dur="4.98">yep yep um and then this the the group</text>
  <text start="564.29" dur="4.23">of doctors we were with when this all</text>
  <text start="566.03" dur="5.61">happened gave us a breakup letter and</text>
  <text start="568.52" dur="5.01">say okay go ahead what happened is we</text>
  <text start="571.64" dur="4.56">woke up one morning and we had three</text>
  <text start="573.53" dur="4.38">happy healthy nine month old children by</text>
  <text start="576.2" dur="3.27">that evening you know we took him for a</text>
  <text start="577.91" dur="4.05">vaccination by that evening they were</text>
  <text start="579.47" dur="3.93">autistic what we said to our</text>
  <text start="581.96" dur="3.6">pediatrician is we&amp;#39;re not going to do</text>
  <text start="583.4" dur="4.2">anything we&amp;#39;re not gonna we&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="585.56" dur="4.77">to do anymore vaccinations until we know</text>
  <text start="587.6" dur="4.5">what happened here what they said is if</text>
  <text start="590.33" dur="3.33">you don&amp;#39;t continue to do exactly what</text>
  <text start="592.1" dur="3.63">you did the day your children turned</text>
  <text start="593.66" dur="2.89">autistic we&amp;#39;re going to fire you from</text>
  <text start="595.73" dur="3.849">our</text>
  <text start="596.55" dur="5.25">so they broke up with us they broke up</text>
  <text start="599.579" dur="3.841">they send this a lovely letter saying we</text>
  <text start="601.8" dur="3.599">were no longer welcome at their practice</text>
  <text start="603.42" dur="5.279">because we weren&amp;#39;t going to continue</text>
  <text start="605.399" dur="11.101">well-baby checks and that is the one</text>
  <text start="608.699" dur="12.45">decision that will never write okay just</text>
  <text start="616.5" dur="11.43">so you know these people are sorry for</text>
  <text start="621.149" dur="9.06">everything they can argue with families</text>
  <text start="627.93" dur="4.68">that your child because it might be a</text>
  <text start="630.209" dur="5.07">single child was genetic they can try</text>
  <text start="632.61" dur="5.43">and put that back on the family and say</text>
  <text start="635.279" dur="5.671">somehow your genes are weak but with us</text>
  <text start="638.04" dur="5.37">having two boys and one girl</text>
  <text start="640.95" dur="3.15">they lose the argument with us hands</text>
  <text start="643.41" dur="3.929">down</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="6.57">so we are the living proof that they&amp;#39;re</text>
