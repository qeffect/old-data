  <text start="403.3" dur="4.17">out to the the mainstream media people</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="6.42">didn&amp;#39;t know that so I like to joke I was</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="5.81">banned before it was cool but you know I</text>

  <text start="2462.11" dur="3.75">whatever it may be if they came together</text>
  <text start="2464.12" dur="3.27">we could reach ten twenty thirty million</text>
  <text start="2465.86" dur="4.31">people and actually find this in the</text>
  <text start="2467.39" dur="2.78">courts yes sir</text>
  <text start="2481.969" dur="8.5">how do they have the right yeah I think</text>
  <text start="2488.969" dur="3.75">well real fast the Communications</text>
  <text start="2490.469" dur="3.721">Decency Act basically gives them blanket</text>
  <text start="2492.719" dur="3.691">immunity from a lot of things they get</text>
  <text start="2494.19" dur="4.019">to play and publisher versus platform</text>
  <text start="2496.41" dur="4.069">kind of pick and choose it seems with</text>
  <text start="2498.209" dur="4.8">which one they&amp;#39;re going to be that day</text>
  <text start="2500.479" dur="5.411">it&amp;#39;s difficult to challenge them on a</text>
  <text start="2503.009" dur="4.47">constitutional ground even with free</text>
  <text start="2505.89" dur="3.75">speech arguments actually some of the</text>
  <text start="2507.479" dur="3.901">tactics that the lawyer that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2509.64" dur="3.629">working with the super lawyer suggested</text>
  <text start="2511.38" dur="3.78">weren&amp;#39;t even based on free speech</text>
  <text start="2513.269" dur="4.141">because it&amp;#39;s difficult to get there and</text>
  <text start="2515.16" dur="4.26">they have a pretty good triangle hold it</text>
  <text start="2517.41" dur="3.99">is looking better because we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2519.42" dur="3.329">some government action we&amp;#39;ve seen some</text>
  <text start="2521.4" dur="3.3">state AG&amp;#39;s get together to look at</text>
  <text start="2522.749" dur="3.99">antitrust action we&amp;#39;ve seen an executive</text>
  <text start="2524.7" dur="4.799">order for the FEC to look into this from</text>
  <text start="2526.739" dur="4.651">comp and we&amp;#39;ve also seen senators and</text>
  <text start="2529.499" dur="2.941">congresspeople kind of drilling them and</text>
  <text start="2531.39" dur="2.939">saying look you&amp;#39;re gonna lose your</text>
  <text start="2532.44" dur="8.309">immunity to keep this up but none of</text>
  <text start="2534.329" dur="8.071">that is gonna save us by 2020 sorry sir</text>
  <text start="2540.749" dur="3.21">like they&amp;#39;ll telephone get stuff for</text>
  <text start="2542.4" dur="3.51">this stuff what why can&amp;#39;t they stop</text>
  <text start="2543.959" dur="3.6">these people they could and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2545.91" dur="3.299">coming where&amp;#39;s it come from from</text>
  <text start="2547.559" dur="3.601">Congress or does it come from the</text>
  <text start="2549.209" dur="4.74">president so we obviously there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2551.16" dur="4.349">two there&amp;#39;s two hats here we can try</text>
  <text start="2553.949" dur="2.91">this with the government and President</text>
  <text start="2555.509" dur="2.911">Trump we try to force the FEC to</text>
  <text start="2556.859" dur="3.21">actually do something and you know in</text>
  <text start="2558.42" dur="3.48">two degree his hands are tied</text>
  <text start="2560.069" dur="5.01">we can also try this from the bottom up</text>
  <text start="2561.9" dur="5.159">from sort of a lawsuit civil so possibly</text>
  <text start="2565.079" dur="3.51">like a business antitrust class-action</text>
  <text start="2567.059" dur="3.331">something like that there&amp;#39;s a couple of</text>
  <text start="2568.589" dur="3.541">options we could go with and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2570.39" dur="3.78">actually had one meeting so far for</text>
  <text start="2572.13" dur="4.349">stuff at burning calm where you know a</text>
  <text start="2574.17" dur="4.289">couple of youtubers and truth people</text>
  <text start="2576.479" dur="3.48">came and all total it was about thirteen</text>
  <text start="2578.459" dur="2.671">fourteen of us we spoke with the</text>
  <text start="2579.959" dur="2.28">attorney for about an hour and a half</text>
  <text start="2581.13" dur="3.389">and there were some questions and</text>
  <text start="2582.239" dur="3.891">answers and you know in that group there</text>
  <text start="2584.519" dur="4.31">was enough reach to have two or three</text>
  <text start="2586.13" dur="4.199">million people so if we were to go and</text>
  <text start="2588.829" dur="3.03">have another meeting in the future which</text>
  <text start="2590.329" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re planning and they were to come</text>
  <text start="2591.859" dur="4.2">back and have about 50 or 100 of you</text>
  <text start="2594.289" dur="3.901">know different channels just people that</text>
  <text start="2596.059" dur="3.78">we already know that we can fight you</text>
  <text start="2598.19" dur="3.569">know the momentum could then turn into a</text>
  <text start="2599.839" dur="3.51">role that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m hoping to do so we</text>
  <text start="2601.759" dur="3.75">can actually try to take this all in the</text>
  <text start="2603.349" dur="3.781">courts from the bottom as well in that</text>
  <text start="2605.509" dur="3.6">way Trump is doing his thing we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2607.13" dur="3.57">the best we can on our end but to take</text>
  <text start="2609.109" dur="3.781">on big tech companies clearly it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2610.7" dur="3.18">biggest of all years in the world and</text>
  <text start="2612.89" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s not going to be easy</text>
  <text start="2613.88" dur="6.09">thank you yes sir yeah I have a YouTube</text>
  <text start="2617.42" dur="4.649">channel myself and I&amp;#39;m very frustrated</text>
  <text start="2619.97" dur="3.42">I&amp;#39;ve seen many of the videos that I have</text>
  <text start="2622.069" dur="5.311">on a playlist</text>
  <text start="2623.39" dur="6.899">he raised deleted removed and I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="2627.38" dur="6">interested in solutions and I think</text>
  <text start="2630.289" dur="6.151">there&amp;#39;s a good chance that defining the</text>
  <text start="2633.38" dur="5.729">internet as a public utility because</text>
  <text start="2636.44" dur="5.339">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s like a public water system</text>
  <text start="2639.109" dur="6.361">of pipes you know the wires are the</text>
  <text start="2641.779" dur="6.121">pipes the bits are the water and we are</text>
  <text start="2645.47" dur="6.24">the customers for the bits or the water</text>
  <text start="2647.9" dur="7.109">and there is a movement afoot for some</text>
  <text start="2651.71" dur="6.649">time now called net neutrality where it</text>
  <text start="2655.009" dur="6.51">is determined that the Internet is</text>
  <text start="2658.359" dur="6.341">public utility and that everybody should</text>
  <text start="2661.519" dur="6.591">have the equal right and access to its</text>
  <text start="2664.7" dur="6.29">content and to promote its content</text>
  <text start="2668.11" dur="7.17">and this I think is a growing movement</text>
  <text start="2670.99" dur="6.63">that has trans partisan backing you know</text>
  <text start="2675.28" dur="4.62">both Democrats middle the growth the</text>
  <text start="2677.62" dur="5.4">Republicans get buddy could get behind</text>
  <text start="2679.9" dur="5.1">this because this is antitrust this is</text>
  <text start="2683.02" dur="3.87">what we&amp;#39;re talking about here it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2685" dur="3.57">different than when Bob Bell was broke</text>
  <text start="2686.89" dur="3.84">up or a rockefeller</text>
  <text start="2688.57" dur="5.28">oil was broke up in the turn of the</text>
  <text start="2690.73" dur="5.1">century yeah what do you think this is</text>
  <text start="2693.85" dur="3.99">my personal view on net neutrality and</text>
  <text start="2695.83" dur="3.6">this is there&amp;#39;s a lot that goes into</text>
  <text start="2697.84" dur="3.96">this and I won&amp;#39;t have time to explain it</text>
  <text start="2699.43" dur="4.68">but my view is that government is what</text>
  <text start="2701.8" dur="3.93">got us into the problem with giving them</text>
  <text start="2704.11" dur="3.78">all of these immunities and such and</text>
  <text start="2705.73" dur="3.78">even if we were to use government which</text>
  <text start="2707.89" dur="2.31">is a hammer as we know and everything</text>
  <text start="2709.51" dur="3.18">looks like a nail</text>
  <text start="2710.2" dur="3.93">to use to solve that problem by creating</text>
  <text start="2712.69" dur="3.33">a law with punishments like net</text>
  <text start="2714.13" dur="2.88">neutrality eventually the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="2716.02" dur="3.78">gonna get control of it and use it</text>
  <text start="2717.01" dur="4.95">against us so eventually like if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2719.8" dur="3.6">a force involved or if there&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="2721.96" dur="3.15">a government entity controlling net</text>
  <text start="2723.4" dur="2.94">neutrality for example as soon as they</text>
  <text start="2725.11" dur="3.36">get ahold of it they&amp;#39;re going to turn it</text>
  <text start="2726.34" dur="5.1">into an IRS for the Lois Lerner or an</text>
  <text start="2728.47" dur="4.89">IRA or FBI of the James call me or</text>
  <text start="2731.44" dur="3.72">something like that so as long as they</text>
  <text start="2733.36" dur="3.69">have power it&amp;#39;ll be corrupted eventually</text>
  <text start="2735.16" dur="4.05">I would like to see the power that they</text>
  <text start="2737.05" dur="3.33">already exerting the immunity called</text>
  <text start="2739.21" dur="3.06">clauses and the you know the</text>
  <text start="2740.38" dur="3.54">Communications Decency Act removed and</text>
  <text start="2742.27" dur="3.86">then get the government out of it and</text>
  <text start="2743.92" dur="5.1">when you take these guys on very easily</text>
  <text start="2746.13" dur="5.65">just enforce the Constitution in the</text>
  <text start="2749.02" dur="4.2">internet the exactly exactly and we</text>
  <text start="2751.78" dur="2.97">shouldn&amp;#39;t even need we shouldn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="2753.22" dur="3.03">then go and have special internet</text>
  <text start="2754.75" dur="2.79">versions of our rights I mean think we</text>
  <text start="2756.25" dur="2.97">should even have to do that it should be</text>
  <text start="2757.54" dur="3.48">pretty obvious that we have a First</text>
  <text start="2759.22" dur="5.28">Amendment we have the right to speak and</text>
  <text start="2761.02" dur="4.44">it extends to our digital presence yes</text>
  <text start="2764.5" dur="3.69">sir</text>
  <text start="2765.46" dur="6.74">does anybody have insight as to how</text>
  <text start="2768.19" dur="7.139">these tech companies have developed this</text>
  <text start="2772.2" dur="6.96">left-wing bias is it just an organic</text>
  <text start="2775.329" dur="6.421">that happened or is there a concerted</text>
  <text start="2779.16" dur="4.18">plot</text>
  <text start="2781.75" dur="3.599">what you mean you&amp;#39;re seeing it you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2783.34" dur="4.62">seeing I think it was not too long ago</text>
  <text start="2785.349" dur="4.351">that some of the Democrat DNC staffers</text>
  <text start="2787.96" dur="4.08">were fired because they were white I</text>
  <text start="2789.7" dur="3.72">mean at some point it becomes a cultural</text>
  <text start="2792.04" dur="2.88">thing and they just want to push out</text>
  <text start="2793.42" dur="3.51">conservatives and you&amp;#39;re seeing that at</text>
  <text start="2794.92" dur="3.78">all these big companies so if you&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="2796.93" dur="4.14">wrong politics you better keep it quiet</text>
  <text start="2798.7" dur="4.409">or you&amp;#39;re gonna be pushed out we saw</text>
  <text start="2801.07" dur="4.289">this from I think was James Dunmore and</text>
  <text start="2803.109" dur="4.831">he was a googol and he just did not have</text>
  <text start="2805.359" dur="4.5">that inner part Department memo talking</text>
  <text start="2807.94" dur="3.69">about is the feelings on one of the</text>
  <text start="2809.859" dur="4.861">things they&amp;#39;re talking about with I</text>
  <text start="2811.63" dur="5.07">think it was sexual harassment or or sex</text>
  <text start="2814.72" dur="4.59">rights or something and he had just made</text>
  <text start="2816.7" dur="4.169">a comment that they didn&amp;#39;t like and then</text>
  <text start="2819.31" dur="2.82">they just tried to ruin his career and</text>
  <text start="2820.869" dur="3.271">punished him and he wasn&amp;#39;t even really a</text>
  <text start="2822.13" dur="4.65">conservative so you know there are</text>
  <text start="2824.14" dur="4.17">people that are out there that are</text>
  <text start="2826.78" dur="3.48">conservatives with you within these</text>
  <text start="2828.31" dur="3.63">companies now there was so blowing but</text>
  <text start="2830.26" dur="3.78">for the most part they have pushed out</text>
  <text start="2831.94" dur="10.11">everyone that is a right-wing</text>
  <text start="2834.04" dur="10.11">conservative and that&amp;#39;s engineers all no</text>
  <text start="2842.05" dur="4.43">it&amp;#39;s the education system and so let me</text>
