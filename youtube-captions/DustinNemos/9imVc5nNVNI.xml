  <text start="2.55" dur="4.53">Mouse of Destiny most calm and this is</text>
  <text start="5.43" dur="3.54">just kind of a public service thing</text>
  <text start="7.08" dur="3.36">about carbon 60 so if you&amp;#39;re not into</text>
  <text start="8.97" dur="3.33">the health aspect of things or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="10.44" dur="4.59">not interested in the sea 60 aspect of</text>
  <text start="12.3" dur="4.8">things go ahead turn it off but it has</text>
  <text start="15.03" dur="3.39">come to my attention that there are a</text>
  <text start="17.1" dur="4.08">lot of people out there who probably</text>
  <text start="18.42" dur="6.99">mean well there&amp;#39;s this myth there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="6.419">idea that that wood ash actually has c60</text>
  <text start="25.41" dur="4.56">in it or fullerenes and that is that is</text>
  <text start="27.599" dur="4.051">not I haven&amp;#39;t found anything on that</text>
  <text start="29.97" dur="4.019">that actually sources or or shows</text>
  <text start="31.65" dur="4.44">evidence for that argument but what I do</text>
  <text start="33.989" dur="4.051">see is people selling things like</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="4.44">activated charcoal which you could buy</text>
  <text start="38.04" dur="4.83">by the big chunk of powder you know</text>
  <text start="40.53" dur="4.32">which is really useful really good for</text>
  <text start="42.87" dur="4.11">detoxing your body it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it does not</text>
  <text start="44.85" dur="3.51">leave the intestinal area it just kind</text>
  <text start="46.98" dur="3">of goes through the intestines and</text>
  <text start="48.36" dur="4.109">stomach and everything and it kind of</text>
  <text start="49.98" dur="5.309">draws out toxins I use it for help</text>
  <text start="52.469" dur="5.461">helping with my my mercury detox and my</text>
  <text start="55.289" dur="4.141">chelation protocol that I&amp;#39;ve just kind</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="4.109">of got a simple one at home I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="4.35">for myself which can be dangerous don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="62.039" dur="3.421">just jump into chelation you know go</text>
  <text start="63.78" dur="3.3">read my articles about that and go</text>
  <text start="65.46" dur="4.5">follow all the sources before you try to</text>
  <text start="67.08" dur="5.399">start detoxing metals but people selling</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="4.26">this which is cheap powder at the price</text>
  <text start="72.479" dur="4.231">of fullerenes which which actually</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="4.86">required you know c60 molecules the</text>
  <text start="76.71" dur="4.32">little soccer ball the stuff that I have</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="4.38">in the little Apex health bottles that</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="3.81">kind of you can tell it this is a little</text>
  <text start="83.46" dur="4.89">soccer ball symbol but that&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="84.84" dur="6.029">what the molecule looks like c60 is</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="5.64">produced using an arc reactor in a</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="5.131">sealed gas chamber by arcing lightning</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="5.25">back and forth between two graphite rods</text>
  <text start="96" dur="5.61">it is not the same thing as wood ash so</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="4.44">when I see people selling wood ash or</text>
  <text start="101.61" dur="4.619">even activated charcoal which are fine</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="4.799">for detoxing you know if you&amp;#39;ve got pigs</text>
  <text start="106.229" dur="3.511">for example they love to eat wood ash</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="2.761">it&amp;#39;s really good for them they&amp;#39;ll eat</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="4.05">like a quarter of their diet is wood ash</text>
  <text start="111.24" dur="4.23">and it&amp;#39;s good for your crops it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="3.719">for your fields you can spread burnt ash</text>
  <text start="115.47" dur="3.899">out there like go look at some of those</text>
  <text start="117.509" dur="3.451">volcanic areas and they have such great</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="3.661">growth and minerals and everything else</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="5.54">but it&amp;#39;s really important that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="123.03" dur="7.11">mistake wood ash for c64 laureen&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.5" dur="5.709">buckyballs whatever carbon 60 and pay</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="3.9">that kind of price because you know c60</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="2.101">is is not the cheapest thing in the</text>
  <text start="134.04" dur="3.12">world</text>
  <text start="134.31" dur="5.399">you know it takes you it takes like a</text>
  <text start="137.16" dur="3.439">milligram a day you know it&amp;#39;s not much</text>
  <text start="139.709" dur="4.801">at all</text>
  <text start="140.599" dur="6.461">you can kind of see I get my dogs like</text>
  <text start="144.51" dur="5.46">two drops a day each it does it goes a</text>
  <text start="147.06" dur="5.07">long way but prices are going up</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="4.44">okay I&amp;#39;ve held off as long as I could on</text>
  <text start="152.13" dur="3.75">raising prices but the people who</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="3.57">actually create the fullerenes with</text>
  <text start="155.88" dur="5.37">these expensive machines that get hotter</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="5.28">than the Sun those machines are kind of</text>
  <text start="161.25" dur="3.69">rare as it is those people that have the</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="4.38">ability to process and create fullerenes</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="3.99">and then reduce them down to the purity</text>
  <text start="167.64" dur="3.629">level that we want actually put in our</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="3.779">bodies there&amp;#39;s not a lot of those people</text>
  <text start="171.269" dur="2.791">out there and maybe that&amp;#39;s gonna change</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="3.721">because the the supply and the demand</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="4.17">right now those people are actually</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="3.15">raising their prices I&amp;#39;m not even gonna</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="4.289">be able to get any more until Christmas</text>
  <text start="179.58" dur="5.519">probably so the short the soonest time</text>
  <text start="182.519" dur="5.19">that I have on on restocking is going to</text>
  <text start="185.099" dur="4.95">be probably mid December late December</text>
  <text start="187.709" dur="5.461">somewhere around there I have some oil</text>
  <text start="190.049" dur="5.731">in for now but once I&amp;#39;m out I&amp;#39;m out and</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="4.95">that is you know that&amp;#39;s unfortunate but</text>
  <text start="195.78" dur="4.62">you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the way it</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="3.959">is with the market right now so people</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="3.39">who were in stock and they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="202.079" dur="3.72">activated charcoal I&amp;#39;m not gonna name</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="4.259">names but you know if they&amp;#39;re if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="205.799" dur="3.931">saying or if they&amp;#39;re if they&amp;#39;re touting</text>
  <text start="208.049" dur="2.94">the benefits of activated charcoal and</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="3.81">stuff yeah it&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="210.989" dur="4.411">you may feel results it is not gonna</text>
  <text start="213.54" dur="4.56">give you the kind of longevity benefits</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="5.25">in your cells that you would have from</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="4.53">an actual fullerene you know fullerenes</text>
  <text start="220.65" dur="3.959">leave your stomach they can absorb into</text>
  <text start="222.63" dur="3.63">your skin they actually go into your</text>
  <text start="224.609" dur="3.571">blood brain barrier there they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="3.809">good for all kinds of things they they</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="3.57">stick to the mitochondria of the cell or</text>
  <text start="230.069" dur="4.471">they actually go into it and then they</text>
  <text start="231.75" dur="5.34">actually just basically pull in all the</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="5.729">free radicals and just lock them in it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="4.679">like a vacuum effect and they have this</text>
  <text start="240.269" dur="5.161">interesting effect that they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="5.22">used up in the the chemical process like</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="3.389">many antioxidants would they actually</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="3.361">just stay there and just keep doing the</text>
  <text start="248.819" dur="4.431">action for like two or three days before</text>
  <text start="250.35" dur="6">you pee them out very interesting stuff</text>
  <text start="253.25" dur="4.93">very powerful stuff obviously it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="3.74">FDA approved I don&amp;#39;t make any claims</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="4.02">about it the research stands on its own</text>
  <text start="260.09" dur="5.02">some of the testimonials that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="262.2" dur="5.58">getting are incredible you know some</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="3.06">people are saying that they there don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="267.78" dur="1.98">either</text>
  <text start="268.17" dur="4.17">classes anymore that kind of thing you</text>
  <text start="269.76" dur="3.93">know one lady sent me a review saying</text>
  <text start="272.34" dur="3.15">you know I used to go to the movies and</text>
  <text start="273.69" dur="3.06">have to wear my glasses now I can&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="275.49" dur="4.77">with them on anymore I have to take them</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="5.37">off you know so you know there are some</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="3.9">pretty cool results coming out of this</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="4.65">especially for pets and animals that</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="4.08">have age-related you know ocular</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="3.27">degeneration when they&amp;#39;re eating these</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="4.38">cardboard kibbles their whole lives and</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="4.95">things like that but I just don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="6.06">people to get taken advantage of wood</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="5.76">ash is not c60 activated charcoal while</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="4.17">good for you is not see 60 people that</text>
  <text start="300.75" dur="3.9">are selling this probably think that it</text>
  <text start="302.85" dur="4.14">is there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that spread</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="4.98">the idea that it is they probably aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="4.23">trying to scam you but you got a really</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="3.51">dig deep when you&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="311.22" dur="3.36">experiment with your health like you</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="3.45">know things like this this is you know</text>
  <text start="314.58" dur="4.11">an experimental new thing and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="4.17">not FDA approved it&amp;#39;ll never be FDA</text>
  <text start="318.69" dur="4.32">approved let&amp;#39;s face it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="320.76" dur="3.72">approve the good stuff but the results</text>
  <text start="323.01" dur="3.54">in the research stand for themselves</text>
  <text start="324.48" dur="3.63">obviously the head researcher in the rat</text>
  <text start="326.55" dur="3.39">study which they were trying to kill the</text>
  <text start="328.11" dur="3.87">poor rats with a toxicity study and</text>
  <text start="329.94" dur="4.77">double their lifespan the head</text>
  <text start="331.98" dur="5.16">researcher said safe at high levels over</text>
  <text start="334.71" dur="3.96">long periods of time you know what and</text>
  <text start="337.14" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;m sure that activated charcoal is</text>
  <text start="338.67" dur="4.71">quite safe as well but you&amp;#39;ve still got</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="3.6">a why do I pay 50 bucks for a small</text>
  <text start="343.38" dur="5.52">bottle of activated charcoal that makes</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="6.6">no sense whatsoever I now had to got</text>
  <text start="348.9" dur="3.78">some on my hands here if you get c60</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="3.3">powder on your hands it will actually</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="4.23">absorb into your skin it&amp;#39;s so small you</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="3.03">can&amp;#39;t even see an actual c60 fullerene</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="3.03">molecule by itself</text>
  <text start="357.78" dur="5.63">like over 200 thousand of those things</text>
  <text start="359.94" dur="5.79">will fit on a side of the grain of sand</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="4.06">so I just wanted to get that out there</text>
  <text start="365.73" dur="4.92">kind of a public service announcement if</text>
  <text start="367.47" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;re interested in c60 I mean stock up</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="3.9">while you can I&amp;#39;m raising the prices</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="3.33">because I don&amp;#39;t know what they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="374.55" dur="4.26">raise their prices to yet but I know</text>
  <text start="376.26" dur="5.04">that they&amp;#39;re planning to do so my</text>
  <text start="378.81" dur="3.81">suppliers have told me this I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="4.2">to set up some sort of a partnership</text>
  <text start="382.62" dur="4.77">maybe like I can help them fund the new</text>
  <text start="385.5" dur="3.3">machine to get things going faster or</text>
  <text start="387.39" dur="3.69">something and they can give me some free</text>
  <text start="388.8" dur="4.56">660 for it I don&amp;#39;t know but I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="391.08" dur="7.44">to figure out what I can do to at least</text>
  <text start="393.36" dur="6.93">keep supply going that&amp;#39;s kind of what I</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="2.95">wanted to go through at this point you</text>
  <text start="400.29" dur="4.3">know I&amp;#39;m actually going to</text>
  <text start="401.47" dur="6.3">be moving into some other things as well</text>
  <text start="404.59" dur="5.6">iodine lugol&amp;#39;s iodine solution for those</text>
  <text start="407.77" dur="4.8">who who don&amp;#39;t know about lugol&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.19" dur="3.43">probably the best form of iodine to take</text>
  <text start="412.57" dur="2.97">really good for you</text>
  <text start="413.62" dur="3.39">I finally got my labels in I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="415.54" dur="3.9">start producing and selling some of that</text>
  <text start="417.01" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;ve only got a few right now but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="419.44" dur="4.61">got material to make more coming in</text>
  <text start="421.6" dur="4.95">elemental iodine and potassium iodide</text>
  <text start="424.05" dur="3.7">it&amp;#39;s very very easy to make yourself at</text>
  <text start="426.55" dur="3.21">home so you don&amp;#39;t have to buy it from me</text>
  <text start="427.75" dur="3.45">but it&amp;#39;s the same thing with c60 you can</text>
  <text start="429.76" dur="3">make it yourself at home but sometimes</text>
  <text start="431.2" dur="2.4">people just want to buy it from somebody</text>
  <text start="432.76" dur="1.56">else because they don&amp;#39;t want to go</text>
  <text start="433.6" dur="5.01">through the trouble and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="6.12">understand that there&amp;#39;s also a colloidal</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="3.39">silver I&amp;#39;m gonna be moving into some</text>
  <text start="440.44" dur="4.5">colloidal silver I&amp;#39;ve actually found a</text>
  <text start="442" dur="5.13">great guy to partner with and he he</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="4.35">knows colloidal silver like like the</text>
  <text start="447.13" dur="3.54">back of his hand like he&amp;#39;s got he&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="449.29" dur="3.51">was gonna do it myself that he impressed</text>
  <text start="450.67" dur="5.87">me so much with his knowledge he</text>
  <text start="452.8" dur="6.36">actually has a 320 part per million</text>
  <text start="456.54" dur="4.78">super concentrated form of colloidal</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="4.65">silver he&amp;#39;s gonna sell in like an 8</text>
  <text start="461.32" dur="5.04">ounce bottle and I&amp;#39;m gonna carry that</text>
  <text start="463.81" dur="4.38">product on my cart and that little bit</text>
  <text start="466.36" dur="3.21">you know an 8 ounce bottle which is kind</text>
  <text start="468.19" dur="3.75">of already a bulk because usually they</text>
  <text start="469.57" dur="4.56">sell like a little thing like this if</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="3.72">colloidal silver you know that 8 ounce</text>
  <text start="474.13" dur="4.74">bottle is already going to be a great</text>
  <text start="475.66" dur="5.069">bulk deal but when you actually expand</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="3.24">that into what it can do because you</text>
  <text start="480.729" dur="4.111">don&amp;#39;t want to take that much at once you</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="4.8">take 20 part per million not 320 part</text>
  <text start="484.84" dur="5.46">per million that thing can make gallons</text>
  <text start="486.91" dur="5.4">okay so one of these can stock you</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="4.95">probably four years on colloidal silver</text>
  <text start="492.31" dur="4.919">so that&amp;#39;s cool like my wife has kind of</text>
  <text start="495.25" dur="3.66">got it like a cold right now my baby&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="3.181">got a cold and they&amp;#39;ve got runny noses</text>
  <text start="498.91" dur="3.15">and stuff they don&amp;#39;t listen to me when</text>
  <text start="500.41" dur="3.15">it comes to taking she doesn&amp;#39;t listen to</text>
  <text start="502.06" dur="3.89">when I tell her to take this supplement</text>
  <text start="503.56" dur="5.22">or that supplement you don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="505.95" dur="5.44">so uh she&amp;#39;s standing in the back and</text>

  <text start="825.62" dur="3.659">big part of why I got into the selling</text>
  <text start="827.81" dur="3.36">of these things is so that I could buy</text>
  <text start="829.279" dur="5.221">bulk and stock up for myself because</text>

  <text start="873.889" dur="3.481">activated charcoal to help for certain</text>
  <text start="875.509" dur="7.231">poisons you actually would take grams of</text>

  <text start="914.66" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s kind of the thing with that so</text>
  <text start="916.55" dur="5.399">over time it&amp;#39;s gonna help also really</text>

  <text start="925.67" dur="5.76">Mercola recommends like a little bit of</text>
  <text start="929.18" dur="3.81">raw not raw but slightly cooked egg yolk</text>
  <text start="931.43" dur="3.599">like boiled for three minutes so the</text>
