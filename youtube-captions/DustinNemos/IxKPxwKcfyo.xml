  <text start="2.7" dur="5.97">most of destiny most common apex health</text>
  <text start="5.1" dur="5.28">club now I&amp;#39;m going to condense a video</text>
  <text start="8.67" dur="4.11">that I watched earlier for you guys by</text>
  <text start="10.38" dur="5.61">Mike Maloney who is just a financial</text>
  <text start="12.78" dur="4.44">guru and a really great source of free</text>
  <text start="15.99" dur="2.85">information when it comes to this stuff</text>
  <text start="17.22" dur="3.719">but his video was over an hour so</text>
  <text start="18.84" dur="3.449">hopefully I can beat that and still give</text>
  <text start="20.939" dur="3.151">you kind of the gist of what you need to</text>
  <text start="22.289" dur="3.33">know obviously I&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="24.09" dur="4.259">the economy being in a bad shape for a</text>
  <text start="25.619" dur="4.381">while that sort of contradicts the</text>
  <text start="28.349" dur="4.201">official everything is great because</text>
  <text start="30" dur="4.02">Trump era and the Trump effect and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="32.55" dur="2.64">gonna go into that we&amp;#39;re going to talk</text>
  <text start="34.02" dur="3.36">about it a little bit and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="35.19" dur="4.11">talk about why things are about to go</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="3.33">bad and you should get ready for it so</text>
  <text start="39.3" dur="3.329">please bear with me share this video</text>
  <text start="40.71" dur="4.919">check out the original buying Mike</text>
  <text start="42.629" dur="5.371">Maloney and let&amp;#39;s dig in so these are</text>
  <text start="45.629" dur="4.261">basically just a series of charts I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="48" dur="3.149">added a couple notes to them and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="49.89" dur="2.61">going to go through them with with you</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="3">really quick you&amp;#39;re gonna start to</text>
  <text start="52.5" dur="4.649">notice a pattern most of these charts</text>
  <text start="54.149" dur="4.89">are steeply inclined for some reason or</text>
  <text start="57.149" dur="5.64">another so let&amp;#39;s go through a few this</text>
  <text start="59.039" dur="7.62">is your stock market capitalization so I</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="6.361">want to know for one why is the stock</text>
  <text start="66.659" dur="5.07">market larger than the entire GDP so you</text>
  <text start="69.15" dur="4.53">have this yellow line that is your stock</text>
  <text start="71.729" dur="4.68">market that is the value of all the</text>
  <text start="73.68" dur="4.59">stocks out there and the purple line now</text>
  <text start="76.409" dur="4.35">make sure you guys can see that a little</text>
  <text start="78.27" dur="5.97">darker is a lot smaller than the yellow</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="6">line it wasn&amp;#39;t always so and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="84.24" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s a troubling trend it could be a</text>
  <text start="86.759" dur="3.391">sign of a bubble so so just keep that in</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="4.769">the back of your mind</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="5.399">also this does not include the bond or</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="3.75">real estate markets which are also in</text>
  <text start="95.549" dur="3.661">bubbles so that&amp;#39;s part of the everything</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="5.281">bubble this this yellow line would be a</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="5.88">lot steeper comparatively so that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="102.54" dur="4.32">and we&amp;#39;re gonna continue to the next one</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="3.18">I didn&amp;#39;t really order them I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="106.86" dur="3.299">that you need to to make sense of this</text>
  <text start="108.27" dur="4.41">so I&amp;#39;m just gonna go through and just</text>
  <text start="110.159" dur="4.771">kind of refresh as I go to each one so</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="4.17">you have three lines here it gets a</text>
  <text start="114.93" dur="4.11">little jumbled pay attention around</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="5.46">certain dates like the dates of crashes</text>
  <text start="119.04" dur="4.8">like 2008 a big one and you see these</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="2.94">gray bars in the background you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="5.13">notice a lot of those those are going to</text>
  <text start="125.25" dur="5.819">be periods of recession in the US so we</text>
  <text start="128.97" dur="4.5">have the blue line which is your</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="4.351">adjusted monetary base that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="5.07">the money out there you have the red</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="4.86">line which is your top 5,000 stock</text>
  <text start="138.54" dur="3.66">market cap so it&amp;#39;s basically all the</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="3.78">stocks out there and then you have the</text>
  <text start="142.2" dur="4.23">tax receipt so it&amp;#39;s basically the</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="3.72">government&amp;#39;s income so compared these</text>
  <text start="146.43" dur="3.87">numbers and then look what really</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="4.05">happened right around 2008 like it used</text>
  <text start="150.3" dur="4.29">to be that the green was on top look at</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="5.13">that so you used to have more and this</text>
  <text start="154.59" dur="4.62">is back to like you know early 90s and</text>
  <text start="156.96" dur="5.55">stuff but used to have more government</text>
  <text start="159.21" dur="5.31">income then comparatively like the</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="4.38">entire stock of it look that it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="4.47">doubled it - it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really a dramatic</text>
  <text start="166.89" dur="4.56">difference now it used to be a lot</text>
  <text start="168.99" dur="5.49">smaller and then the monetary base also</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="4.85">used to be a lot smaller so this is the</text>
  <text start="174.48" dur="3.99">of course the result of long-term</text>
  <text start="176.3" dur="5.14">manipulation and money printing and</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="5.07">everything that the Fed does we are also</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="4.68">going into zombie companies these are</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="4.71">companies who cannot even service their</text>
  <text start="186.12" dur="3.66">debt so they have too many credit cards</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="3.11">that can&amp;#39;t make their payments that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="4.08">basically the situation they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="191.36" dur="4.66">there&amp;#39;s a box here that represents the</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="4.5">crash of Oh 8 and you can kind of see</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="6.27">that that sharply rises all the way up</text>
  <text start="198.36" dur="6.15">to around our I think just over 12% and</text>
  <text start="202.29" dur="4.38">then you have now where we&amp;#39;re and this</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="4.11">by the way only goes up to 2017 so I</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t know where it is now and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="3.03">scary right there because a lot of these</text>
  <text start="210.27" dur="3.75">charts the data is no longer available</text>
  <text start="211.65" dur="5.52">especially since the shutdown but this</text>
  <text start="214.02" dur="4.86">one is the Fed made QE bubble okay so</text>
  <text start="217.17" dur="3.81">this is where they&amp;#39;ve been trying to</text>
  <text start="218.88" dur="4.02">money print to solve the problem from</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="2.759">o84 all this time and it&amp;#39;s gotten worse</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="3.72">and worse and worse</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="5.371">so 12% which was really bad then has</text>
  <text start="226.62" dur="4.619">gotten up to almost 15 16 percent</text>
  <text start="229.11" dur="5.28">probably way beyond that because like I</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="6.061">said that&amp;#39;s two year old numbers we also</text>
  <text start="234.39" dur="6.03">have silver mine production this is kind</text>
  <text start="237.3" dur="4.71">of a thrown in there kind of he saved it</text>
  <text start="240.42" dur="3.48">for laughs then that makes sense because</text>
  <text start="242.01" dur="4.08">this is your alternative but keep in</text>
  <text start="243.9" dur="6.51">mind with everything else that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="6.24">on silver has a lot more of a value play</text>
  <text start="250.41" dur="4.38">than gold for various supply and demand</text>
  <text start="252.33" dur="3.87">reasons and such one of which is that if</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="5.479">you look at this this pie chart here</text>
  <text start="256.2" dur="6.6">only about 40 something for T to 43%</text>
  <text start="260.269" dur="4.21">actually comes from gold and silver</text>
  <text start="262.8" dur="4.33">mines the rest is from copper and lead</text>
  <text start="264.479" dur="4.751">and zinc mines so people don&amp;#39;t generally</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="3.51">go to silver mines to mine silver they</text>
  <text start="269.23" dur="3.54">get it when they&amp;#39;re looking for other</text>
  <text start="270.64" dur="5.31">things like copper gold and lead and</text>
  <text start="272.77" dur="4.53">zinc and such so about thirty percent of</text>
  <text start="275.95" dur="3.75">it comes from the mines within what</text>
  <text start="277.3" dur="4.59">happened do you mean if if you go</text>
  <text start="279.7" dur="4.23">through a big reset a lot of the demand</text>
  <text start="281.89" dur="4.05">in the auto and the housing sectors and</text>
  <text start="283.93" dur="4.08">and new construction and such for copper</text>
  <text start="285.94" dur="3.99">lead and zinc disappear so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.01" dur="4.74">looking at potentially fifty sixty</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="7.44">percent loss of your silver supply you</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="6.69">know in flow and you also end up with a</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="4.38">situation where we&amp;#39;re using more silver</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="3.36">faster than we can possibly even pull it</text>
  <text start="301.75" dur="3.84">out of the ground even in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.8" dur="4.14">numbers so you know it just keeps</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="3.78">getting used for more and more different</text>
  <text start="306.94" dur="5.22">technologies potentially could even be</text>
  <text start="309.37" dur="4.62">used as like a a consumable fuel source</text>
  <text start="312.16" dur="3.57">for laser-type technology and such in</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="3.6">the future I&amp;#39;ve heard I these are kind</text>
  <text start="315.73" dur="4.35">of coming down the pipeline but you know</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="5.28">we&amp;#39;re in such a time of inventions and</text>
  <text start="320.08" dur="4.86">inventiveness and possibilities that who</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="3.57">knows what&amp;#39;s possible so you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="3.27">have to ask yourself you know how much</text>
  <text start="326.44" dur="3.87">need is gonna be there for lead and zinc</text>
  <text start="328.21" dur="4.05">which is you know auto and batteries</text>
  <text start="330.31" dur="3.96">that kind of thing and how much will be</text>
  <text start="332.26" dur="5.25">left for copper which a lot of that is</text>
  <text start="334.27" dur="4.68">new construction and such and repairs to</text>
  <text start="337.51" dur="2.79">some degree because they you know in</text>
  <text start="338.95" dur="2.94">poor areas they&amp;#39;re just tearing copper</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="3.63">out of head can&amp;#39;t tell you how many</text>
  <text start="341.89" dur="3.93">times I&amp;#39;ve had copper torn out of</text>
  <text start="343.93" dur="3.39">buildings that I had owned because if</text>
  <text start="345.82" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s taken for a week in a bad</text>
  <text start="347.32" dur="4.56">area that copper is gone for for the</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="5.25">pennies I cost you thousands but pennies</text>
  <text start="351.88" dur="4.05">that they can get out of it so so this</text>
  <text start="354.46" dur="5.1">is kind of where we are in terms of</text>
  <text start="355.93" dur="5.82">silver supply and and again we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="359.56" dur="3.93">you know billions of ounces I think it</text>
  <text start="361.75" dur="4.17">is like just tons and tons of ounces of</text>
  <text start="363.49" dur="3.69">gold really available if you think about</text>
  <text start="365.92" dur="2.37">all the stuff that they&amp;#39;ve got hidden in</text>
  <text start="367.18" dur="3.3">the ground still in places like</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="4.17">chocolate mountain in the Grand Canyon</text>
  <text start="370.48" dur="3.45">so there&amp;#39;s a lot of gold out there</text>
  <text start="372.46" dur="2.85">there&amp;#39;s not that much silver so if you</text>
  <text start="373.93" dur="5.31">really think about it honestly</text>
  <text start="375.31" dur="5.55">in terms of usefulness supply demand we</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="3.03">may be looking at a situation within our</text>
  <text start="380.86" dur="3.3">lifetimes where silver becomes more</text>
  <text start="382.27" dur="6.54">valuable than gold but you know at least</text>
  <text start="384.16" dur="7.04">it deserves a far better evaluation or</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="4.89">evaluation than silver than gold would</text>
  <text start="391.2" dur="4.54">so I don&amp;#39;t I tend to focus on silver</text>
  <text start="393.7" dur="3.75">rather than gold but the mainstream</text>
  <text start="395.74" dur="2.549">people in the market would focus on gold</text>
  <text start="397.45" dur="2.219">more</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="2.88">that will probably see the first two</text>
  <text start="399.669" dur="3.81">moves anyway because people don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="401.169" dur="3.9">think of silver right now as a monetary</text>
  <text start="403.479" dur="4.291">instrument they think of it as just you</text>
  <text start="405.069" dur="4.77">know industrial metal and that kind of</text>
  <text start="407.77" dur="5.16">thing that&amp;#39;s all and they won&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="409.839" dur="4.47">demand monetarily until things change</text>
  <text start="412.93" dur="3.59">whereas with gold it still has some</text>
  <text start="414.309" dur="5.13">monetary value and such right now even</text>
  <text start="416.52" dur="4.629">so that that&amp;#39;s like who&amp;#39;s buying it for</text>
  <text start="419.439" dur="3.391">what reasons there&amp;#39;s not many people</text>
  <text start="421.149" dur="3.181">buying silver for investment reasons as</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="3.78">a percentage of the total you know</text>
  <text start="424.33" dur="3.929">there&amp;#39;s just not that many of us right</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="3.329">now it&amp;#39;s mostly industry so when that</text>
  <text start="428.259" dur="3.3">changes and people are starting to get</text>
  <text start="429.939" dur="5.28">into metals again for their own safety</text>
  <text start="431.559" dur="5.16">the silver will will not only revalue</text>
  <text start="435.219" dur="3.301">based on its current metric but it will</text>
  <text start="436.719" dur="3.711">be value based on the metric of being a</text>
  <text start="438.52" dur="4.259">currency again so there&amp;#39;s that as well</text>
  <text start="440.43" dur="4.889">we also have in the real estate</text>
  <text start="442.779" dur="4.831">situation this is from realtor.com</text>
  <text start="445.319" dur="4.93">median asking prices dropping</text>
  <text start="447.61" dur="4.47">year-over-year this is Silicon Valley in</text>
  <text start="450.249" dur="4.081">San Francisco so just just an example</text>
  <text start="452.08" dur="5.97">people are dropping the price of their</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="5.729">houses dramatically from up 250 down -</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="3.989">it looks like they&amp;#39;re dropping about a</text>
  <text start="460.059" dur="4.741">hundred thousand on average from the the</text>
  <text start="462.039" dur="4.98">price just to get it to sell because</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="3.599">things are getting rough so I mean</text>
  <text start="467.019" dur="2.76">people out there asking me should I sell</text>
  <text start="468.399" dur="3.75">my house and I can&amp;#39;t give you financial</text>
  <text start="469.779" dur="6.841">advice but the tape isn&amp;#39;t to note for</text>
  <text start="472.149" dur="7.23">sure we also have price cuts spike</text>
  <text start="476.62" dur="5.43">Silicon Valley in San Francisco Redoute</text>
  <text start="479.379" dur="5.94">number of reduced prices percent change</text>
  <text start="482.05" dur="5.569">from a number of year from a year ago so</text>
  <text start="485.319" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s up over 400%</text>
  <text start="487.619" dur="4.33">in terms of total number of actual</text>
  <text start="490.389" dur="3.51">reduced prices so people are just in</text>
  <text start="491.949" dur="4.83">terms of quantity dropping dropping</text>
  <text start="493.899" dur="6.87">dropping dropping so median and just</text>
  <text start="496.779" dur="6.151">just just straight quantity as well we</text>
  <text start="500.769" dur="5.01">also have this one this is the private</text>
  <text start="502.93" dur="7.65">debt out there on the market seventy</text>
  <text start="505.779" dur="9.711">trillion dollars it is massive and okay</text>
  <text start="510.58" dur="6.85">zoomed out a little bit there area just</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="4.34">okay</text>
  <text start="517.43" dur="4.41">make sure you can still see this I think</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="4.98">we&amp;#39;re good so this is the percent of the</text>
  <text start="521.84" dur="5.4">currency supply covered behind gold and</text>
  <text start="524.81" dur="4.2">you know Silver&amp;#39;s like I said most</text>
  <text start="527.24" dur="3.18">people just stick with gold as far as</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="3.18">like the general understanding and</text>
  <text start="530.42" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s fine Silver&amp;#39;s just taking it</text>
  <text start="532.19" dur="3.51">another level to get a better deal but</text>
  <text start="533.9" dur="4.71">the gold and silver kind of the same</text>

  <text start="538.61" dur="3.72">in history you&amp;#39;ve noticed where there</text>
  <text start="540.59" dur="4.05">has been a revaluation and gold has</text>
  <text start="542.33" dur="5.16">caught up and you can kind of see where</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="5.37">we are right now in historical terms</text>
  <text start="547.49" dur="4.02">okay so we&amp;#39;re right here in 2018 you can</text>
  <text start="550.01" dur="4.2">see this big green arrow this has very</text>
  <text start="551.51" dur="4.11">very very cheap this is where we are now</text>
  <text start="554.21" dur="3.51">this is why I&amp;#39;ve been saying you know</text>
  <text start="555.62" dur="4.65">silver and gold at this price is just a</text>
  <text start="557.72" dur="4.53">crazy deal it&amp;#39;s insane it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="560.27" dur="4.59">Black Friday prices everything&amp;#39;s on sale</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="5.19">right now everything that I want to buy</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="6">if I have the money here we have</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="5.58">national debt as a percentage of GDP and</text>
  <text start="570.86" dur="4.86">you can compare we are basically right</text>
  <text start="573.02" dur="4.8">back up to World War 2 levels but this</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="4.26">does not this chart does not include our</text>
  <text start="577.82" dur="5.04">unfunded liabilities so in fact we are</text>
  <text start="579.98" dur="6.12">way beyond World War two levels that is</text>
  <text start="582.86" dur="4.92">insane and if you don&amp;#39;t know what that</text>
  <text start="586.1" dur="4.35">means then go check out world war two</text>
  <text start="587.78" dur="4.29">and how it impacted the economy and just</text>
  <text start="590.45" dur="4.44">kind of get caught up real fast</text>
  <text start="592.07" dur="4.41">it was rough now this one&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="594.89" dur="4.38">complicated so I&amp;#39;m gonna try to go</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="6.66">through here real fast Green is the</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="6.75">discount rate for Japan for interest</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="7.05">rates blue is the Bank of Japan&amp;#39;s total</text>
  <text start="606.02" dur="6.99">assets and red is the Japanese stock</text>
  <text start="610.19" dur="4.14">market now this is kind of not USA but I</text>
  <text start="613.01" dur="3.24">want to make the point that everything</text>
  <text start="614.33" dur="4.56">is related to the whole world economies</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="4.71">is connected here so the low interest</text>
  <text start="618.89" dur="3.45">and and and it always works the same in</text>
  <text start="620.96" dur="3.51">every country when they do these things</text>
  <text start="622.34" dur="4.2">so what did they do with the interest</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="5.61">rates you see how the green just just</text>
  <text start="626.54" dur="6.26">drops down and then at the same time red</text>
  <text start="630.08" dur="5.88">shoots up so lowered interest rates</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="4.24">obviously prompts malinvestment people</text>
  <text start="635.96" dur="2.61">are like well that money is just</text>
  <text start="637.04" dur="4.08">basically for free I don&amp;#39;t have to pay</text>
  <text start="638.57" dur="4.35">any interest let me borrow it I can make</text>
  <text start="641.12" dur="3.66">all kinds of investments well you maybe</text>
  <text start="642.92" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t make the smartest of investments</text>
  <text start="644.78" dur="3.66">and then when things go back the other</text>
  <text start="647.03" dur="2.58">way and the interest rates start to rise</text>
  <text start="648.44" dur="3.03">you owe a lot of money</text>
  <text start="649.61" dur="4.289">investments and you are in trouble and</text>
  <text start="651.47" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s where everyone is right now and</text>
  <text start="653.899" dur="4.051">the Bank of Japan&amp;#39;s total assets of</text>
  <text start="655.82" dur="3.72">course you know the central bank which I</text>
  <text start="657.95" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t think was tracking until you know</text>
  <text start="659.54" dur="3.989">about halfway through this chart but the</text>
  <text start="661.1" dur="4.59">central bank started to just zoom up in</text>
  <text start="663.529" dur="4.441">its assets as well just off the chart</text>
  <text start="665.69" dur="3.209">because it makes them rich because</text>
  <text start="667.97" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re printing money and</text>
  <text start="668.899" dur="3.421">buying things of course</text>
  <text start="671.06" dur="2.85">so you&amp;#39;re propping up you&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="672.32" dur="3.24">propping up weak business instead of</text>
  <text start="673.91" dur="4.859">allowing the free market to flush out</text>
  <text start="675.56" dur="6.18">inefficient you know competitors and</text>
  <text start="678.769" dur="4.681">such and players in the market so you</text>
  <text start="681.74" dur="4.32">know there&amp;#39;s a good point that the</text>
  <text start="683.45" dur="4.259">low-interest manipulation rate created</text>
  <text start="686.06" dur="4.23">huge bubbles in the economy as the price</text>
  <text start="687.709" dur="4.38">of currency was artificially lowered and</text>
  <text start="690.29" dur="3.6">spurred on malinvestment so if you</text>
  <text start="692.089" dur="4.021">cannot trust your currency signals which</text>
  <text start="693.89" dur="4.35">you know as Mike points out is half of</text>
  <text start="696.11" dur="3.36">every transaction as the money if you</text>
  <text start="698.24" dur="2.73">can&amp;#39;t trust the money</text>
  <text start="699.47" dur="3.57">how can you play them for business</text>
  <text start="700.97" dur="4.44">appropriately and that is the entire</text>
  <text start="703.04" dur="3.93">point why do we have central banks and</text>
  <text start="705.41" dur="4.679">you guys are going to get even angrier</text>
  <text start="706.97" dur="4.35">if you&amp;#39;re not yet but just hang on a</text>
  <text start="710.089" dur="3.601">little bit longer so this is the</text>
  <text start="711.32" dur="4.92">interest rates discount for Japan again</text>
  <text start="713.69" dur="6.72">these gray bars are just really for the</text>
  <text start="716.24" dur="6.99">US so look at the the connection there</text>
  <text start="720.41" dur="5.76">okay the gray bars indicate recessions</text>
  <text start="723.23" dur="6.63">in the USA not Japan so that the green</text>
  <text start="726.17" dur="5.58">bar is the Japanese market are the</text>
  <text start="729.86" dur="6.9">interest rates they are crashing down</text>
  <text start="731.75" dur="7.47">after US recessions</text>
  <text start="736.76" dur="4.62">so their economy lags right behind our</text>
  <text start="739.22" dur="3.54">recessions and this problem extends</text>
  <text start="741.38" dur="3.209">pretty much worldwide everything is</text>
  <text start="742.76" dur="3.66">connected if we have trouble here it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="744.589" dur="3.961">going to ripple and any of these other</text>
  <text start="746.42" dur="3.69">major economies as well because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="748.55" dur="3.39">leaning on each other like a bunch of</text>
  <text start="750.11" dur="5.729">drunks and it&amp;#39;s really who&amp;#39;s gonna fall</text>
  <text start="751.94" dur="5.459">first excess reserves of dupatta and by</text>
  <text start="755.839" dur="2.911">the way they&amp;#39;re all continually trying</text>
  <text start="757.399" dur="3.511">to drink each other under the table</text>
  <text start="758.75" dur="5.22">behind the scenes with the hardest</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="5.1">liquors imaginable so Nancy Pelosi style</text>
  <text start="763.97" dur="5.25">you know charging the taxpayer for the</text>
  <text start="766.01" dur="5.25">entire time we also have excess reserves</text>
  <text start="769.22" dur="3.84">of depository institutions now that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="771.26" dur="3.09">the big players that&amp;#39;s the big banks</text>
  <text start="773.06" dur="2.94">that are getting this directly from the</text>
  <text start="774.35" dur="3.929">central banks and such okay these are</text>
  <text start="776" dur="4.98">the big players and this is millions of</text>
  <text start="778.279" dur="5.131">dollars so you&amp;#39;re getting up to 333</text>
  <text start="780.98" dur="4.109">million million there so you get</text>
  <text start="783.41" dur="3.359">up to a lot of money you&amp;#39;re getting into</text>
  <text start="785.089" dur="3.06">a lot of money these guys have all this</text>
  <text start="786.769" dur="2.971">cash sitting around because it was</text>
  <text start="788.149" dur="3.331">printed up out of thin air for them and</text>
  <text start="789.74" dur="3.209">then they&amp;#39;re allowed to spend and buy</text>
  <text start="791.48" dur="3.299">things we don&amp;#39;t get that kind of</text>
  <text start="792.949" dur="3.45">advantage okay the government is picking</text>
  <text start="794.779" dur="3.6">winners and losers and that is why you</text>
  <text start="796.399" dur="3.81">have to deal with evil corrupt</text>
  <text start="798.379" dur="4.741">corporations that censor you like</text>
  <text start="800.209" dur="4.711">Facebook and big big tech Google Twitter</text>
  <text start="803.12" dur="4.86">all of them and that&amp;#39;s why you have to</text>
  <text start="804.92" dur="4.349">deal with terrible you know businesses</text>
  <text start="807.98" dur="3.029">that are just completely evil like</text>
  <text start="809.269" dur="3.271">Monsanto all the time instead of having</text>
  <text start="811.009" dur="4.08">the free market put those people out of</text>
  <text start="812.54" dur="4.38">business because the government is</text>
  <text start="815.089" dur="4.141">giving them so much advantage and using</text>
  <text start="816.92" dur="4.62">the power of the state both the carrot</text>
  <text start="819.23" dur="5.43">and the stick to force people not to</text>
  <text start="821.54" dur="6.479">compete with them we also have the</text>
  <text start="824.66" dur="5.52">monetary base in the red here versus the</text>
  <text start="828.019" dur="4.471">currency in circulation so the green</text>
  <text start="830.18" dur="4.56">area is the money that we the people</text>
  <text start="832.49" dur="4.05">have access to and the red area is the</text>
  <text start="834.74" dur="4.019">money that the insiders have their funny</text>
  <text start="836.54" dur="4.62">money that they buy up all the assets</text>
  <text start="838.759" dur="4.5">with and impoverish the world so this is</text>
  <text start="841.16" dur="3.869">a very important chart right here and</text>
  <text start="843.259" dur="5.371">you kind of can make your entire case</text>
  <text start="845.029" dur="5.25">just off this one chart continuing on we</text>
  <text start="848.63" dur="5.61">have federal government current</text>
  <text start="850.279" dur="7.5">expenditures and red that&amp;#39;s our expenses</text>
  <text start="854.24" dur="8.279">and then in green we have our income and</text>
  <text start="857.779" dur="8.281">this includes things like tariffs and</text>
  <text start="862.519" dur="4.951">duties and does not include black budget</text>
  <text start="866.06" dur="4.589">that is not officially included in</text>
  <text start="867.47" dur="5.369">expenses so all of our income and not</text>
  <text start="870.649" dur="5.581">even all of our expenses and you can</text>
  <text start="872.839" dur="5.69">kind of see green is just barely keeping</text>
  <text start="876.23" dur="5.039">up yes we&amp;#39;re getting all this investment</text>
  <text start="878.529" dur="5.41">right now like I said that means they</text>
  <text start="881.269" dur="4.471">record tax revenues everything else but</text>
  <text start="883.939" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s all based on debt when that falls</text>
  <text start="885.74" dur="4.23">apart this whole thing flips this whole</text>
  <text start="888.319" dur="5.94">thing goes upside down and the store is</text>
  <text start="889.97" dur="6.539">empty so continuing on this red line</text>
  <text start="894.259" dur="4.14">again with recession indicators in the</text>
  <text start="896.509" dur="4.62">US in the background this is the federal</text>
  <text start="898.399" dur="4.471">government current expenditures federal</text>
  <text start="901.129" dur="5.911">government current tax receipts divided</text>
  <text start="902.87" dur="6.24">so you have your expense divided by your</text>
  <text start="907.04" dur="4.099">income now percent that we spend above</text>
  <text start="909.11" dur="5.029">or below our income</text>
  <text start="911.139" dur="5.901">note the surplus in the 50s okay</text>
  <text start="914.139" dur="5.25">so right there we had this kind of</text>
  <text start="917.04" dur="6.219">decent time I guess</text>
  <text start="919.389" dur="7.531">and that was percent that we spend above</text>
  <text start="923.259" dur="5.82">or below our income now that we are</text>
  <text start="926.92" dur="8.159">spending now we are spending a lot more</text>
  <text start="929.079" dur="9.54">than we earn and we have up to three</text>
  <text start="935.079" dur="6.961">times more than we&amp;#39;re earning now so</text>
  <text start="938.619" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s this is like you know the</text>
  <text start="942.04" dur="2.879">old-timers have the wisdom financially</text>
  <text start="943.809" dur="4.351">and they understand how to balance a</text>
  <text start="944.919" dur="5.85">budget whereas the the Millennials my</text>
  <text start="948.16" dur="4.769">age this group they just they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="950.769" dur="4.44">they don&amp;#39;t understand the consequences</text>
  <text start="952.929" dur="4.77">of tomorrow or they just don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="955.209" dur="4.35">about them if they do I don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="957.699" dur="3.211">they think the government&amp;#39;s gonna save</text>
  <text start="959.559" dur="3.06">them and they don&amp;#39;t understand the way</text>
  <text start="960.91" dur="3.57">government works government is forced</text>
  <text start="962.619" dur="3.39">nothing more and it&amp;#39;s out of options</text>
  <text start="964.48" dur="2.519">they can&amp;#39;t keep doing anything that</text>
  <text start="966.009" dur="3.091">everything they&amp;#39;re doing doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="966.999" dur="7.291">anymore this charts tell the entire</text>
  <text start="969.1" dur="7.349">story so continuing on here precious</text>
  <text start="974.29" dur="6.359">metals free market eventually catch up</text>
  <text start="976.449" dur="5.97">in a big way so this is the inflation</text>
  <text start="980.649" dur="3.87">adjusted price at where gold should be</text>
  <text start="982.419" dur="4.431">about eighteen thousand dollars and this</text>
  <text start="984.519" dur="4.82">is what has happened before when it</text>
  <text start="986.85" dur="5.979">readjusted right there in that circle</text>
  <text start="989.339" dur="6.04">sharply to catch up and this is where we</text>
  <text start="992.829" dur="5.19">are today over here so you&amp;#39;ll kind of</text>
  <text start="995.379" dur="6.81">see what could happen in the very near</text>
  <text start="998.019" dur="9.3">future quite a bit of leap and here we</text>
  <text start="1002.189" dur="7.64">go so the inflation adjusted 16,500 so I</text>
  <text start="1007.319" dur="5.69">misspoke about the last chart that was</text>
  <text start="1009.829" dur="7.36">that was kind of where things have gone</text>
  <text start="1013.009" dur="7.3">and this is where things would be</text>
  <text start="1017.189" dur="5.07">adjusted to inflation and this is going</text>
  <text start="1020.309" dur="4.77">off the like the 1980 and before</text>
  <text start="1022.259" dur="4.44">consumer price index and numbers because</text>
  <text start="1025.079" dur="3">they changed it to fudge with the</text>
  <text start="1026.699" dur="3.901">numbers to make it seem like inflation</text>
  <text start="1028.079" dur="4.98">wasn&amp;#39;t really that bad so we&amp;#39;re at a 300</text>
  <text start="1030.6" dur="5.64">year low way down here that is quite a</text>
  <text start="1033.059" dur="5.49">discount and when it shoots back up to</text>
  <text start="1036.24" dur="4.77">where it probably should be according to</text>
  <text start="1038.549" dur="3.691">1980 before they rigged those numbers</text>
  <text start="1041.01" dur="5.929">and look at what happened to the</text>
  <text start="1042.24" dur="7.86">when they did we would be around $17,000</text>
  <text start="1046.939" dur="5.681">continuing on the blue line is a</text>
  <text start="1050.1" dur="5.16">non-financial corporate business credit</text>
  <text start="1052.62" dur="5.49">market instruments liability so the</text>

  <text start="1058.11" dur="4.11">sector like not the banks with everybody</text>
  <text start="1059.64" dur="5.55">else and then the red is the effective</text>
  <text start="1062.22" dur="4.589">federal funds rate interest rate so free</text>

  <text start="1068.79" dur="7.47">buybacks and helping drive the bubble so</text>
  <text start="1072.63" dur="5.58">when you take the federal funds rate</text>
  <text start="1076.26" dur="4.25">from really high up here you know where</text>
  <text start="1078.21" dur="6.83">it was insane back in the day and then</text>
  <text start="1080.51" dur="8.41">goes down to basically zero here in 20</text>
  <text start="1085.04" dur="7.12">2008 and on you get this sort of sharp</text>

  <text start="1135.3" dur="3.99">busts we have artificially low interest</text>

  <text start="1139.29" dur="3.78">the Fed making the bubbles that they</text>

  <text start="1143.07" dur="2.64">everyone else has to suffer unless you</text>
  <text start="1144.57" dur="2.4">of course you know how these cycles work</text>
  <text start="1145.71" dur="4.349">you can predict them an echo a lot of</text>

  <text start="1154.41" dur="3.24">your and your behind and wait patiently</text>
  <text start="1156" dur="3.36">and not have to sweat in the meantime</text>
  <text start="1157.65" dur="3.39">worrying about if you made the wrong</text>

  <text start="1172.19" dur="4.829">basically the top 5,000 total market cap</text>
  <text start="1174.919" dur="3.6">stocks and then the green line is the</text>
  <text start="1177.019" dur="4.02">income so the everything bubble</text>
  <text start="1178.519" dur="6.181">resulting from the crash of o8 postponed</text>
  <text start="1181.039" dur="4.95">and enlarged is the predictable result</text>
  <text start="1184.7" dur="3">of money printing so right here in this</text>
  <text start="1185.989" dur="4.111">black box on the end you can see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1187.7" dur="3.689">happened since 2008 that fat gray bar is</text>
  <text start="1190.1" dur="4.709">the recession and then look at those</text>
  <text start="1191.389" dur="5.73">bars they have really gone haywire this</text>

  <text start="1208.159" dur="4.801">might actually be able to you know feed</text>
  <text start="1209.779" dur="5.85">myself for a while so maybe I should</text>
  <text start="1212.96" dur="5.399">just hide out stow away a bunch of food</text>
  <text start="1215.629" dur="4.17">and armed up because this is exactly how</text>
  <text start="1218.359" dur="3.481">bad it could get worst case scenario</text>
  <text start="1219.799" dur="4.35">like I said in the past we have such a</text>
  <text start="1221.84" dur="5.01">large military presence in such a large</text>
  <text start="1224.149" dur="4.681">like law and order type culture I doubt</text>

  <text start="1230.899" dur="3.39">the country like in the cities yeah but</text>
  <text start="1232.669" dur="3.36">like in the countries who&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>

  <text start="1236.029" dur="5.64">normal I don&amp;#39;t predict a lot of rioting</text>
  <text start="1238.97" dur="4.709">and chaos out there but there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1241.669" dur="3.771">problems these people in the cities the</text>
  <text start="1243.679" dur="4.59">anti fatigues are gonna cause problems</text>
  <text start="1245.44" dur="5.469">and this is your booming economy this</text>
  <text start="1248.269" dur="4.831">you know I want to put a disclaimer that</text>
  <text start="1250.909" dur="3.661">I&amp;#39;m still pro Trump but he&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="1253.1" dur="3.269">credit for the everything bubble and</text>
  <text start="1254.57" dur="3.539">this I think will hurting when it does</text>
  <text start="1256.369" dur="4.41">pop but then we also see the Fed is</text>
  <text start="1258.109" dur="4.081">making it pop so maybe he played it</text>
  <text start="1260.779" dur="2.64">brilliantly rode the wave and he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1262.19" dur="2.939">blame them for the crash and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1263.419" dur="3.031">perfectly exactly the way it should</text>
  <text start="1265.129" dur="2.76">because it&amp;#39;s not his fault that this</text>
  <text start="1266.45" dur="4.409">happened of course in the first place</text>
  <text start="1267.889" dur="5.01">this is entirely their fault he just</text>
  <text start="1270.859" dur="4.8">showed up and knew how to to ride the</text>
  <text start="1272.899" dur="4.38">wave he was just a surfer so we have the</text>
  <text start="1275.659" dur="3.21">dot-com bubble here at first which is</text>
  <text start="1277.279" dur="3.75">you know you guys may remember that was</text>
  <text start="1278.869" dur="3.69">a big deal but uh right here it looks</text>
  <text start="1281.029" dur="3.75">like the bunny hill at the ski ranch</text>
  <text start="1282.559" dur="3.781">this is nothing and then you have a</text>
  <text start="1284.779" dur="2.941">housing bubble and that looks like it</text>
  <text start="1286.34" dur="3.089">could be kind of scary going down that</text>
  <text start="1287.72" dur="3.16">ramp and then the everything bubble</text>
  <text start="1289.429" dur="3.041">looks like you&amp;#39;re probably not</text>
  <text start="1290.88" dur="5.4">making halfway down before you have a</text>
  <text start="1292.47" dur="6.24">concussion so before you dashed upon the</text>
  <text start="1296.28" dur="7.11">rocks at the bottom so this is uh where</text>
  <text start="1298.71" dur="6.42">we are now and this is a I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1303.39" dur="3.57">warning and kind of doing the best I</text>
  <text start="1305.13" dur="4.38">could to get people ready for this for</text>
  <text start="1306.96" dur="5.09">the last year and I think it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1309.51" dur="4.89">time you know no one can call in but</text>
  <text start="1312.05" dur="4.36">we&amp;#39;re getting there</text>
  <text start="1314.4" dur="4.74">so income versus expense I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1316.41" dur="6.99">back to the beginning aren&amp;#39;t we total</text>
  <text start="1319.14" dur="9">debt GDP national debt of course the the</text>
  <text start="1323.4" dur="6.6">GDP here is destroyed by the red I mean</text>
  <text start="1328.14" dur="3.45">basically there was some purple but it</text>
  <text start="1330" dur="5.37">was engulfed by the red very quickly so</text>
  <text start="1331.59" dur="6.9">our GDP or gross domestic product is</text>
  <text start="1335.37" dur="4.8">gone eaten up by our national debt which</text>
  <text start="1338.49" dur="4.35">has knows nothing to speak of with our</text>
  <text start="1340.17" dur="5.58">tire debt the rest of its just unpaid</text>
  <text start="1342.84" dur="5.64">for debt snowball this is important to</text>
  <text start="1345.75" dur="4.38">understand as well and there&amp;#39;s only 33</text>
  <text start="1348.48" dur="4.53">slides I think so we&amp;#39;re almost done but</text>
  <text start="1350.13" dur="5.22">this debt snowball so pay attention to</text>
  <text start="1353.01" dur="4.23">the colors for you know households</text>
  <text start="1355.35" dur="4.05">non-financial corporate government and</text>
  <text start="1357.24" dur="3.96">financial and then pay attention to the</text>
  <text start="1359.4" dur="4.95">just the general thicknesses of each</text>
  <text start="1361.2" dur="5.19">color around each time like you know</text>
  <text start="1364.35" dur="6.48">eight there you can kind of see that the</text>
  <text start="1366.39" dur="5.73">black bar almost doubled and hang on my</text>
  <text start="1370.83" dur="5.46">windows who wants me to do something</text>
  <text start="1372.12" dur="5.34">remind me later okay sorry the black bar</text>
  <text start="1376.29" dur="5.67">almost doubled and that&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="1377.46" dur="8.81">government debt snowball right the gray</text>
  <text start="1381.96" dur="6.81">bar between 2008 through 2003 and 2008</text>
  <text start="1386.27" dur="5.01">basically looks like more than double</text>
  <text start="1388.77" dur="4.56">just kind of off the you it&amp;#39;s kind of a</text>
  <text start="1391.28" dur="3.61">inaccurate way of doing it I guess but</text>
  <text start="1393.33" dur="4.26">it looks like it about more than doubled</text>
  <text start="1394.89" dur="4.92">and that of course is your financial</text>
  <text start="1397.59" dur="4.68">debt so you&amp;#39;ve got these guys playing</text>
  <text start="1399.81" dur="3.87">around and then the next colors that are</text>
  <text start="1402.27" dur="3.15">going to get hit the hardest are going</text>
  <text start="1403.68" dur="4.86">to be the households and the</text>
  <text start="1405.42" dur="5.76">non-financial corporate and that is</text>
  <text start="1408.54" dur="5.7">coming so everything bubble will be</text>
  <text start="1411.18" dur="4.98">where non-financial corporate business</text>
  <text start="1414.24" dur="5.46">credit market instruments liability on</text>
  <text start="1416.16" dur="5.4">the this is the blue so your liability</text>
  <text start="1419.7" dur="4.14">of all these companies going through the</text>
  <text start="1421.56" dur="2.82">roof your effective federal funds rate</text>
  <text start="1423.84" dur="4.79">this is the</text>
  <text start="1424.38" dur="6.9">interest rate is the red went down here</text>
  <text start="1428.63" dur="5.47">so this is showing corporate easy money</text>
  <text start="1431.28" dur="4.47">debt has now become a huge debt service</text>
  <text start="1434.1" dur="4.04">burden and it&amp;#39;s going to implode many</text>
  <text start="1435.75" dur="4.77">companies like I said they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1438.14" dur="4.75">much of an option left and there may be</text>
  <text start="1440.52" dur="5.88">duplicates I&amp;#39;m not sure if there is I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1442.89" dur="7.169">probably cover twice and not notice so</text>
  <text start="1446.4" dur="5.04">this is the Congressional Budget Office</text>
  <text start="1450.059" dur="3.331">government fairytales that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1451.44" dur="3.84">telling us we are here at the little</text>
  <text start="1453.39" dur="5.1">yellow line and that kind of tells you</text>
  <text start="1455.28" dur="6.69">we are basically almost about to break</text>
  <text start="1458.49" dur="6.66">the record for the longest economic</text>
  <text start="1461.97" dur="5.54">expansion and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="1465.15" dur="4.86">this red bar at the top is what their</text>
  <text start="1467.51" dur="4.24">guesstimate is so their guesstimate is</text>
  <text start="1470.01" dur="4.47">that we&amp;#39;re going to double the longest</text>
  <text start="1471.75" dur="4.169">economic expansion ever this shows you</text>
  <text start="1474.48" dur="3.27">the kind of educ that we&amp;#39;re dealing with</text>
  <text start="1475.919" dur="3.331">and the kind of we&amp;#39;ll just make up</text>
  <text start="1477.75" dur="2.909">whatever they want to hear so that they</text>
  <text start="1479.25" dur="4.5">give us more money in power</text>
  <text start="1480.659" dur="6.75">bullcrap so the longest in history 1991</text>
  <text start="1483.75" dur="6.36">to 2001 and this is a few months old but</text>
  <text start="1487.409" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s still very important and the</text>
  <text start="1490.11" dur="6.48">average time between economic recessions</text>
  <text start="1492.659" dur="6.121">is four and a half years continuing on</text>
  <text start="1496.59" dur="7.17">total assets all commercial banks</text>
  <text start="1498.78" dur="6.389">divided by GDP is the shows this is</text>
  <text start="1503.76" dur="3.539">showing that the bank&amp;#39;s own about eighty</text>
  <text start="1505.169" dur="4.561">percent of the economy right now and</text>
  <text start="1507.299" dur="3.541">that&amp;#39;s not a good sign and as we go</text>
  <text start="1509.73" dur="3.09">through these you&amp;#39;re gonna see just how</text>
  <text start="1510.84" dur="4.35">unstable the banks themselves are which</text>
  <text start="1512.82" dur="6.63">is a big part of this whole wobbly</text>
  <text start="1515.19" dur="6.869">tripod that we&amp;#39;re standing on so we also</text>
  <text start="1519.45" dur="5.01">have amount outstanding of domestic debt</text>
  <text start="1522.059" dur="5.431">securities for non-financial corporation</text>
  <text start="1524.46" dur="5.93">issuers all maturities residents of</text>
  <text start="1527.49" dur="7.22">issuer in China so this is China</text>
  <text start="1530.39" dur="8.89">basically this is China&amp;#39;s debt since</text>
  <text start="1534.71" dur="8.02">before 2002 so it has spiked up more</text>
  <text start="1539.28" dur="7.98">than one hundred thousand percent and</text>
  <text start="1542.73" dur="7.91">this is the Chinese Golden Age this is</text>
  <text start="1547.26" dur="4.91">the period of record improvement in</text>
  <text start="1550.64" dur="4.02">growth across China where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1552.17" dur="5.43">building ghost cities and useless you</text>
  <text start="1554.66" dur="5.97">know empty towns and things that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="1557.6" dur="6.81">to end by the way so this golden age for</text>
  <text start="1560.63" dur="5.79">China is over we have here the blue line</text>
  <text start="1564.41" dur="3.389">and again pay attention that big</text>
  <text start="1566.42" dur="3.03">recession bar right at two thousand</text>
  <text start="1567.799" dur="4.161">eight and then all the numbers go crazy</text>
  <text start="1569.45" dur="5.01">the blue line is the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="1571.96" dur="4">Bank&amp;#39;s total assets so they&amp;#39;re getting a</text>
  <text start="1574.46" dur="3.54">lot of our assets here they&amp;#39;re buying</text>
  <text start="1575.96" dur="4.2">them up with fake money of course if you</text>
  <text start="1578" dur="4.29">print monopoly money and you can buy up</text>
  <text start="1580.16" dur="3.12">real things let&amp;#39;s do it all day long why</text>
  <text start="1582.29" dur="3.96">not</text>
  <text start="1583.28" dur="4.889">Bank of Japan total assets for Japan is</text>
  <text start="1586.25" dur="4.2">the red line so they&amp;#39;re doing the same</text>
  <text start="1588.169" dur="5.221">thing a little bit slower a little bit</text>
  <text start="1590.45" dur="4.859">less dramatically but nonetheless doing</text>
  <text start="1593.39" dur="3.75">it and then you know they have a zombie</text>

  <text start="1597.14" dur="4.169">assets for the euro area so the green</text>
  <text start="1599.27" dur="4.05">numbers so basically this is just</text>
  <text start="1601.309" dur="3.811">showing that the banks are racing to</text>
  <text start="1603.32" dur="4.349">money print and increase the money</text>
  <text start="1605.12" dur="5.01">supply and via Bassets and just mess</text>
  <text start="1607.669" dur="3.991">everything up worse than ever trying to</text>
  <text start="1610.13" dur="3.679">drive prices back up trying to keep</text>

  <text start="1627.23" dur="3.87">really undervalued and overvalued and</text>
  <text start="1629.75" dur="2.82">then you get into like bubble hyper</text>

  <text start="1644.69" dur="9.03">in the yellow to green range we&amp;#39;ll see</text>

  <text start="1665.059" dur="3.511">that&amp;#39;s blue</text>
  <text start="1665.84" dur="5.4">so they actually you know not bad okay</text>
  <text start="1668.57" dur="5.099">total liabilities wow that&amp;#39;s really far</text>
  <text start="1671.24" dur="6.6">up there and that&amp;#39;s almost as much as</text>
  <text start="1673.669" dur="5.701">they have out there on on assets so</text>
  <text start="1677.84" dur="3.37">almost all of the money that they have</text>
  <text start="1679.37" dur="5.59">they have loaned out</text>
  <text start="1681.21" dur="6.36">so that means that in this economy</text>
  <text start="1684.96" dur="5.84">that&amp;#39;s about to go nosedive and hit rock</text>
  <text start="1687.57" dur="8.31">bottom and you know a hundred to</text>
  <text start="1690.8" dur="9.13">complete stop in no time flat if they</text>
  <text start="1695.88" dur="5.31">lose a small percentage of those debts</text>
  <text start="1699.93" dur="2.73">that they are owed people go into</text>
  <text start="1701.19" dur="4.53">bankruptcy or whatever just don&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="1702.66" dur="5.1">that blue could dramatically drop down</text>
  <text start="1705.72" dur="4.5">total assets could drop down below total</text>
  <text start="1707.76" dur="5.07">liabilities bankruptcy and the number of</text>
  <text start="1710.22" dur="4.14">the reserves that they have down there</text>
  <text start="1712.83" dur="2.76">like I said bankruptcy because they</text>
  <text start="1714.36" dur="2.67">don&amp;#39;t have any reserves they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1715.59" dur="4.47">enough reserves to cover this at all so</text>
  <text start="1717.03" dur="5.07">red is what they owe you blue is what</text>
  <text start="1720.06" dur="6.17">they are owed and green is how much cash</text>
  <text start="1722.1" dur="6.87">they actually have to cover your red so</text>
  <text start="1726.23" dur="4.54">they don&amp;#39;t have enough green to make</text>
  <text start="1728.97" dur="4.97">your red green let&amp;#39;s put it that way I</text>
  <text start="1730.77" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t know if that makes sense anyway</text>
  <text start="1733.94" dur="5.74">this is the percentage of economy banks</text>
  <text start="1737.01" dur="5.6">own total asset I think I already went</text>
  <text start="1739.68" dur="5.7">through this one but total assets blue</text>
  <text start="1742.61" dur="4.96">I&amp;#39;ll owned by the banks and then the</text>

  <text start="1747.57" dur="6.03">one in there and duplicate and is that</text>
