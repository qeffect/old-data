  <text start="88.979" dur="3.091">a rally can&amp;#39;t get any more exciting than</text>

  <text start="97.47" dur="3.3">in Ohio when you were there the energy</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="3.57">was infectious you know I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="4.23">really been able to see the line from</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="3.869">inside once you&amp;#39;re inside an auditorium</text>
  <text start="105" dur="2.91">it&amp;#39;s real difficult because the Secret</text>
  <text start="106.709" dur="2.701">Service and all the different things to</text>
  <text start="107.91" dur="3.72">go back out but they actually had</text>
  <text start="109.41" dur="4.2">windows at this particular rally so we</text>
  <text start="111.63" dur="3.39">could actually see the line so he was</text>
  <text start="113.61" dur="3.48">saying there were lots of people outside</text>
  <text start="115.02" dur="3.57">there really were lots of people outside</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="2.97">because I was calling in and doing some</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="3.72">media interviews at the same time as I</text>
  <text start="120.06" dur="3.78">was able to see he was actually telling</text>
  <text start="122.31" dur="3.03">us the truth yeah and you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="3.869">funny because the media likes to say</text>
  <text start="125.34" dur="4.11">that he exaggerated sand that you know</text>
  <text start="127.709" dur="4.021">there are empty seats but really that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.45" dur="4.14">not the case and in fact even with this</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="3.27">most recent rally that they had not the</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="3.03">most recent one in</text>
  <text start="135" dur="4.68">ohayo but the one that they had in</text>
  <text start="136.62" dur="4.95">Orlando and people were camping for 48</text>
  <text start="139.68" dur="3.9">hours actually one of my best friends</text>
  <text start="141.57" dur="3.15">was first in line has named Cleveland</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="3.3">McKee he actually got there</text>
  <text start="144.72" dur="3.69">intentionally first in line because he</text>
  <text start="146.88" dur="3.33">wanted to be able to show that you know</text>
  <text start="148.41" dur="3.33">Orange County is ready for this visit</text>
  <text start="150.21" dur="3.21">and so they literally said it was</text>
  <text start="151.74" dur="3.06">raining you know so they were sweating</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="3.33">the whole nine yards but they were first</text>
  <text start="154.8" dur="4.2">in line they got interviewed by national</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="4.56">local international media it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="159" dur="4.41">exciting that&amp;#39;s amazing yeah I mean it</text>
  <text start="161.31" dur="4.56">really demonstrates just the dedication</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="5.28">of you know these Trump supporters</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="5.06">because they were there for 48 hours</text>
  <text start="168.69" dur="5.82">ahead of time when I can&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="170.93" dur="5.14">anyone else you know bring I think what</text>
  <text start="174.51" dur="3.96">we have to remember is that was a very</text>
  <text start="176.07" dur="4.29">special rally that was the kickoff to</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="4.47">the for the president of the 2020</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="4.62">process moreover I was part of the fun</text>
  <text start="182.94" dur="3.93">campaign finance fundraising team so I</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="3.96">was off property we raised twenty four</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="3.33">point eight million dollars and less</text>
  <text start="188.94" dur="3.75">than what was it twenty-four forty-eight</text>
  <text start="190.2" dur="4.29">hours that&amp;#39;s a signal that people really</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="3.18">like this president so it was fun I was</text>
  <text start="194.49" dur="3.9">actually making phone calls alongside</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="5.1">Laura Trump and Donald Trump jr. and</text>
  <text start="198.39" dur="4.53">Eric Trump it was pretty exciting and</text>
  <text start="200.97" dur="3.72">you know I was very impressed with how</text>
  <text start="202.92" dur="4.289">many people I called that didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="3.75">flinch they were ready to donate to this</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="3.301">president because the bottom line is</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s either President Trump or socialism</text>
  <text start="210.51" dur="3.449">that&amp;#39;s what it comes down to that is</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="3.81">really what it&amp;#39;s boiling down to at this</text>
  <text start="213.959" dur="4.891">point especially when you see the 20/20</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="4.11">line up with what is it 24 candidates at</text>
  <text start="218.85" dur="2.88">this point I think that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="2.94">change rapidly I think they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="3.39">start realizing whether they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="3.81">fundraise they can&amp;#39;t be on stage and</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="3.72">make solid arguments I think we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="3.18">start seeing some shifts but I also</text>
  <text start="228.84" dur="1.95">think you&amp;#39;re gonna see some shifts at</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="2.43">the top</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="3.33">I don&amp;#39;t think Joe Biden is actually</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="3.06">playing as well to the left that they</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="3.089">thought he was gonna play they thought</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="4.14">he was gonna play well against the</text>
  <text start="237.209" dur="4.59">president and in fact he Kaunas absentee</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="3.09">minded not really clear on stage at</text>
  <text start="241.799" dur="2.91">times and I think that&amp;#39;s gonna actually</text>
  <text start="242.88" dur="3.03">we&amp;#39;ll see a switch up there soon</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="3.361">I think you&amp;#39;re gonna see it go down to</text>
  <text start="245.91" dur="4.139">ten rapidly because eventually if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="4.05">somebody on the other side you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="250.049" dur="3.901">start figuring out a strategy of really</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="3.72">what can accompany accomplished right</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="3">now we don&amp;#39;t see that happening right</text>
  <text start="255.84" dur="3.42">and I think you&amp;#39;re absolutely correct</text>
  <text start="256.95" dur="3.779">about Biden because even though the</text>
  <text start="259.26" dur="3.839">mainstream media was really touting him</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="5.221">as the winner of the last democratic</text>
  <text start="263.099" dur="3.551">debate he really floundered on stage and</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="2.499">in fact there</text>
  <text start="266.65" dur="3.93">several times where he could have</text>
  <text start="268.449" dur="4.651">respond and so he would just trail off</text>
  <text start="270.58" dur="4.89">and end with well anyway and well I</text>
  <text start="273.1" dur="4.14">think not that I want to you know tout</text>
  <text start="275.47" dur="3.39">the other side but I think Camila Hera</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="4.05">Kamala Harris continues to be the</text>
  <text start="278.86" dur="4.23">stronger part of that I still don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.29" dur="3.45">think she&amp;#39;s presidential I think</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="3.51">somewhere down the line if somebody else</text>
  <text start="284.74" dur="3.36">gets it she might be their opportunity</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="4.289">for a vice presidential candidate</text>
  <text start="288.1" dur="5.069">especially if it&amp;#39;s Joe Biden but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="290.889" dur="3.451">see what happens right so tell me a</text>
  <text start="293.169" dur="2.881">little bit about how you got involved</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="3.81">with the Trump campaign it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="3.81">funny story you know because I by</text>
  <text start="298.15" dur="5.85">audition for The Apprentice many years</text>
  <text start="299.86" dur="5.82">ago I got kicked off I didn&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="304" dur="3.24">it out of the first round but what I</text>
  <text start="305.68" dur="3.84">started realizing is how much I was</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="3.959">impressed with him as a leader not only</text>
  <text start="309.52" dur="3.42">had he made billions of dollars in real</text>
  <text start="311.199" dur="3.961">estate and all the things he did but</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="4.259">even if that show I started watching how</text>
  <text start="315.16" dur="4.14">he calculated his choices and decision</text>
  <text start="317.199" dur="3.78">making so long story short as I had</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="2.76">gotten a call from a journalist locally</text>
  <text start="320.979" dur="2.641">it sent me a message on Facebook</text>
  <text start="322.06" dur="3.479">actually he said they&amp;#39;re looking for a</text>
  <text start="323.62" dur="3.78">county chairman in all 67 counties in</text>
  <text start="325.539" dur="3.571">Florida you should apply and I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="327.4" dur="3.87">okay what have I got to lose so I did</text>
  <text start="329.11" dur="3.779">but it was not that easy I started</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="3.51">making phone calls falling them up with</text>
  <text start="332.889" dur="3.541">the emails to our local re-see which is</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="3.389">a Republican Executive Committee and</text>
  <text start="336.43" dur="2.73">finally one day I just showed up and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="338.169" dur="2.131">like what&amp;#39;s going on you guys aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.16" dur="2.34">even returning my phone calls and</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;re like can you sit down for a</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="2.88">second Randy and I go okay but what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.9" dur="2.43">this gonna be</text>
  <text start="344.38" dur="3.48">and the bottom line is she indicated to</text>
  <text start="346.33" dur="3.089">me they did not want us to organize in</text>
  <text start="347.86" dur="3.27">Orange County so what I got ready and</text>
  <text start="349.419" dur="2.911">did is I contacted the co-chairman for</text>
  <text start="351.13" dur="3.03">the state of Florida who&amp;#39;s now the</text>
  <text start="352.33" dur="3.48">Republican Party of Florida Chairman Joe</text>
  <text start="354.16" dur="2.939">brooders and I said you know I really</text>
  <text start="355.81" dur="3.27">want to do this I think I&amp;#39;d be great at</text>
  <text start="357.099" dur="3.75">it blah blah blah he goes well give me</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="3.78">some time so he eventually is the one</text>
  <text start="360.849" dur="3.841">he&amp;#39;s the reason I told him as the reason</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="3.839">I became the chairman because had he not</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="3.57">done that I don&amp;#39;t know how would have</text>
  <text start="366.699" dur="3.631">ever got it accomplished and so</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="4.529">eventually we immediately do this this</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="4.44">funder this event with over 100 people</text>
  <text start="372.789" dur="4.291">show up and that was in December of 2015</text>
  <text start="374.77" dur="4.38">and I knew we were onto something now</text>
  <text start="377.08" dur="4.23">certainly the left and has an openly gay</text>
  <text start="379.15" dur="4.38">conservative you can imagine the LGBTQ</text>
  <text start="381.31" dur="4.47">community just I&amp;#39;m the most hated gay</text>
  <text start="383.53" dur="4.02">man in Orlando and it is what it is but</text>
  <text start="385.78" dur="3.509">the reality was we had this momentum</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="3.299">going and that was just on a momentum in</text>
  <text start="389.289" dur="3.511">Orange County it was a momentum in</text>
  <text start="390.849" dur="4.261">Florida it was a momentum in the country</text>
  <text start="392.8" dur="4.049">and so the best part was we won the</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="4.049">presidential preference primary I</text>
  <text start="396.849" dur="3.631">believe was in March in 2016 and now</text>
  <text start="399.159" dur="3.661">we&amp;#39;ve got to take our way through this</text>
  <text start="400.48" dur="4.89">elegant selection process as we recall</text>
  <text start="402.82" dur="3.96">was really challenging they were ready</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="5.82">to challenge him on the floor because</text>
  <text start="406.78" dur="6.72">the far right that the the swamp was so</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="4.41">concerned about this type of person they</text>
  <text start="413.5" dur="4.14">could not control that they didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="415.6" dur="3.42">him to get the nomination but then you</text>
  <text start="417.64" dur="3.12">know but what was it three or four weeks</text>
  <text start="419.02" dur="3.45">before we finally realized he&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="420.76" dur="3.24">the one he&amp;#39;s gonna be the nominee and we</text>
  <text start="422.47" dur="3.57">take that through an election night win</text>
  <text start="424" dur="3.72">which to be honest to this day I still</text>
  <text start="426.04" dur="3.9">can&amp;#39;t even believe it I mean we had been</text>
  <text start="427.72" dur="4.14">sign waving all day I was all sunburnt</text>
  <text start="429.94" dur="3.81">media was trying to interview me that</text>
  <text start="431.86" dur="4.05">evening and I just couldn&amp;#39;t do it</text>
  <text start="433.75" dur="4.38">I was just finally it was all hitting me</text>
  <text start="435.91" dur="4.02">you know we were just exhausted but I</text>
  <text start="438.13" dur="3.54">still still felt we were going to win as</text>
  <text start="439.93" dur="3.24">a matter of fact I remember a local</text>
  <text start="441.67" dur="3.33">reporter coming up to me when I was sign</text>
  <text start="443.17" dur="2.91">waving his you know Randy tell us what</text>
  <text start="445" dur="3.33">you really think is gonna happen tonight</text>
  <text start="446.08" dur="3.81">and I said we&amp;#39;re gonna win and he just</text>
  <text start="448.33" dur="4.59">looked at me it was a pot this is long</text>
  <text start="449.89" dur="4.23">pause and I saw him a few weeks after</text>
  <text start="452.92" dur="2.61">that did he was you know I went back to</text>
  <text start="454.12" dur="3.93">the news station I told everybody you</text>
  <text start="455.53" dur="4.35">were crazy well guess what we weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="3.51">crazy so we go through and we go to the</text>
  <text start="459.88" dur="3.09">inauguration which I&amp;#39;d never been I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="3.27">never even worked on a presidential</text>
  <text start="462.97" dur="3.6">campaign before so let alone make my way</text>
  <text start="464.83" dur="4.44">to the inauguration that kind of thought</text>
  <text start="466.57" dur="4.29">okay finally we get some time we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="469.27" dur="3.18">get any time as a matter of fact he</text>
  <text start="470.86" dur="3.12">announced that as you know the day he</text>
  <text start="472.45" dur="4.2">had was inaugurated he filed paperwork</text>
  <text start="473.98" dur="4.35">to run for 2020 and the media wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="476.65" dur="3.42">really ready to let go of him and nor</text>
  <text start="478.33" dur="3.21">was he ready to let go of the media I</text>
  <text start="480.07" dur="2.58">think he&amp;#39;s brilliant I think you except</text>
  <text start="481.54" dur="2.97">every day and he tweets us and he</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="3.93">reminds us what news were gonna talk</text>
  <text start="484.51" dur="4.35">about today he&amp;#39;ll tell you that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="4.41">easing tension but it certainly is the</text>
  <text start="488.86" dur="4.47">directive that comes out of it and so</text>
  <text start="490.99" dur="5.31">now three years later here we are and</text>

  <text start="496.3" dur="2.85">wonderful to do some of the things I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="498.22" dur="2.7">gotten to do whether it be the</text>
  <text start="499.15" dur="4.05">fundraising side working with the</text>
  <text start="500.92" dur="4.52">campaign meeting with Brad Parks Cal who</text>
  <text start="503.2" dur="5.31">is the campaign Chairman talking about</text>

  <text start="510.43" dur="4.14">these Hispanics for Trump these things</text>
  <text start="512.14" dur="4.23">that we kind of talked about in 2016 but</text>
  <text start="514.57" dur="3.75">we certainly didn&amp;#39;t have the time we</text>
  <text start="516.37" dur="5.04">have over a year now to really start</text>
  <text start="518.32" dur="4.47">formulating and actually engaging in a</text>
  <text start="521.41" dur="2.91">grassroots effort you know I really</text>
  <text start="522.79" dur="3.21">believe grassroots is what wins</text>
  <text start="524.32" dur="3.81">elections I&amp;#39;m headed to California soon</text>
  <text start="526" dur="3.33">to talk to groups and people wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="3.81">think about California for Trump but</text>
  <text start="529.33" dur="4.25">there&amp;#39;s tons of Trump supporters just</text>
  <text start="531.94" dur="3.019">recently Donald Trump jr. was out</text>
  <text start="533.58" dur="3.15">raise millions of dollars for the</text>
  <text start="534.959" dur="4.5">president and one three or four day</text>
  <text start="536.73" dur="4.169">period so we got to start getting people</text>
  <text start="539.459" dur="2.671">more comfortable talking about</text>
  <text start="540.899" dur="3.601">supporting the president which is</text>
  <text start="542.13" dur="4.95">something I do all the time I just love</text>
  <text start="544.5" dur="5.519">doing it and you&amp;#39;re absolutely right on</text>
  <text start="547.08" dur="6.9">that because you know going back to even</text>
  <text start="550.019" dur="6.57">the election and even on that night they</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="4.77">all wanted to present this idea that</text>
  <text start="556.589" dur="4.471">Hillary Clinton was going to win mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="558.75" dur="3.93">and even they have presented a poll not</text>
  <text start="561.06" dur="4.56">long before that I said Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="562.68" dur="6.21">has a 97 percent chance of winning that</text>
  <text start="565.62" dur="5.07">you know president then candidate Trump</text>
  <text start="568.89" dur="5.46">he did not have a shot in the dark right</text>
  <text start="570.69" dur="5.339">at all and then he won and even now they</text>
  <text start="574.35" dur="3.33">want you oh they had that champagne</text>
  <text start="576.029" dur="3.541">ready they had the balloons ready to</text>
  <text start="577.68" dur="4.02">fall in but what they didn&amp;#39;t know is</text>
  <text start="579.57" dur="3.449">what when you go to a rally and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="581.7" dur="4.29">know if you&amp;#39;ve ever been to a rally or</text>
  <text start="583.019" dur="5.82">not Tampa if you go to a rally you</text>
  <text start="585.99" dur="5.159">cannot imagine the energy that&amp;#39;s inside</text>
  <text start="588.839" dur="4.771">of those when I was in Cincinnati it was</text>
  <text start="591.149" dur="4.411">so loud my body was like pulsating to</text>
  <text start="593.61" dur="4.53">the the sound and all this and people</text>
  <text start="595.56" dur="4.92">were yelling and excited and it was</text>
  <text start="598.14" dur="4.47">pretty it&amp;#39;s like a recycle rockstar you</text>
  <text start="600.48" dur="3.51">know it&amp;#39;s only way I know to you know to</text>
  <text start="602.61" dur="2.969">a correlate it because I think if</text>
  <text start="603.99" dur="4.68">somebody can imagine walking into seeing</text>
  <text start="605.579" dur="5.611">their favorite celebrity / prominent</text>
  <text start="608.67" dur="4.56">person whatever that&amp;#39;s just so exciting</text>
  <text start="611.19" dur="3.87">and that crowd they just there&amp;#39;s certain</text>
  <text start="613.23" dur="3.24">things he can say so he gets away with a</text>
  <text start="615.06" dur="3">lot I&amp;#39;ll be honest there&amp;#39;s no secret</text>
  <text start="616.47" dur="3.9">there but he&amp;#39;ll say something in that</text>
  <text start="618.06" dur="4.019">crowded just go crazy I kind of like it</text>
  <text start="620.37" dur="3.089">when the protesters show up because you</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="3.181">know we&amp;#39;ve all been trained not to touch</text>
  <text start="623.459" dur="3.601">them or anything we just point at them</text>
  <text start="625.26" dur="3.93">and all this fun stuff that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="627.06" dur="5.04">like the same bullying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="629.19" dur="4.68">trying to provide to our presentation in</text>
  <text start="632.1" dur="2.85">those types of situations so it was</text>
  <text start="633.87" dur="2.19">really funny though in Cincinnati</text>
  <text start="634.95" dur="3.48">because I was actually representing</text>
  <text start="636.06" dur="3.57">Salem media so we were on you know you</text>
  <text start="638.43" dur="2.79">know calling in to the show and all this</text>
  <text start="639.63" dur="3.09">stuff and I looked around and we were</text>
  <text start="641.22" dur="3.69">the only ones clapping every time the</text>
  <text start="642.72" dur="3.66">press was speaking and I was like well</text>
  <text start="644.91" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re conservative me yeah I guess I can</text>
  <text start="646.38" dur="3.36">do that right so that was that&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="648.42" dur="3.18">to me one of the highlights of being</text>
  <text start="649.74" dur="5.969">there that day and there really is this</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="6.15">push from the media to present President</text>
  <text start="655.709" dur="5.341">Trump in a bad light and they also want</text>
  <text start="657.75" dur="4.35">to make it appear that the majority is</text>
  <text start="661.05" dur="2.94">against him when</text>
  <text start="662.1" dur="3.81">like you&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re really not</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="4.14">the majority is with him</text>
  <text start="665.91" dur="4.26">they support him and he has done so much</text>
  <text start="668.13" dur="4.86">even within the first two years of his</text>
  <text start="670.17" dur="4.29">presidency there is a long list of</text>
  <text start="672.99" dur="3.51">things that he&amp;#39;s already accomplished</text>
  <text start="674.46" dur="3.69">the list that he is accomplishing are</text>
  <text start="676.5" dur="4.71">things that you and I care about even</text>
  <text start="678.15" dur="4.29">Democrats independents far left a lot of</text>
  <text start="681.21" dur="4.23">things that we care about we care about</text>
  <text start="682.44" dur="5.67">our trade deficit we care about having</text>
  <text start="685.44" dur="5.31">more money in our 401k we care about our</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="4.29">military being strong we care about open</text>
  <text start="690.75" dur="3.27">borders versus closed borders legal</text>
  <text start="692.4" dur="3.12">immigration versus these are the things</text>
  <text start="694.02" dur="3.87">we can all agree on that we care about</text>
  <text start="695.52" dur="4.11">so when they when he makes a mistake and</text>
  <text start="697.89" dur="3.39">says a word off or he makes a phrase</text>
  <text start="699.63" dur="3.72">that they don&amp;#39;t quite like that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="701.28" dur="3.81">they attach themselves to and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="703.35" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s our job to come back and say well</text>
  <text start="705.09" dur="3.12">wait a minute maybe you took that out of</text>
  <text start="706.59" dur="2.97">context maybe you really didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="708.21" dur="2.55">understand what he was trying to say you</text>
  <text start="709.56" dur="2.88">know that&amp;#39;s what I think we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="710.76" dur="4.02">doing now for three-and-a-half going on</text>
  <text start="712.44" dur="4.41">for years this army this group of people</text>
  <text start="714.78" dur="4.14">the silent majority are not silent</text>
  <text start="716.85" dur="4.11">anymore we&amp;#39;ve got to get loud we have to</text>
  <text start="718.92" dur="4.44">remain loud you know I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="720.96" dur="5.58">happens November 4th 2020 when this is</text>
  <text start="723.36" dur="4.65">all over but I can&amp;#39;t tell you in 2021 I</text>
  <text start="726.54" dur="3.81">will be at the inauguration and I know</text>
  <text start="728.01" dur="4.44">it will be President Trump well that is</text>
  <text start="730.35" dur="4.59">great that is really great and I really</text>
  <text start="732.45" dur="3.24">truly believe that he will win again in</text>
  <text start="734.94" dur="2.94">2020</text>
  <text start="735.69" dur="3.03">and so when it comes to the campaign</text>
  <text start="737.88" dur="3.18">right now what are the biggest</text>
  <text start="738.72" dur="3.9">challenges that you face I think that</text>
  <text start="741.06" dur="3.06">from yet remember what I&amp;#39;m focused on</text>
  <text start="742.62" dur="3.57">right now is helping to fundraise for</text>
  <text start="744.12" dur="3.48">the president because he can&amp;#39;t do his</text>
  <text start="746.19" dur="3.51">bread parts kale said this on a</text>
  <text start="747.6" dur="2.94">conference call not long ago he gets to</text>
  <text start="749.7" dur="3.15">do his job</text>
  <text start="750.54" dur="4.5">that means execute a plan all throughout</text>
  <text start="752.85" dur="3.27">the country because we&amp;#39;re fundraising so</text>
  <text start="755.04" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s gonna be my number one priority</text>
  <text start="756.12" dur="3.87">is continue to fundraise for him of the</text>
  <text start="758.58" dur="4.05">five or six pictures I have at the</text>
  <text start="759.99" dur="4.65">president for or because of fundraising</text>
  <text start="762.63" dur="3.57">so I&amp;#39;m gonna continue down that road you</text>
  <text start="764.64" dur="2.85">know we have a weekly radio show which</text>
  <text start="766.2" dur="3.39">we actually do tonight Tuesday night</text>
  <text start="767.49" dur="4.92">Trump and Tuesday sponsored by a local</text>
  <text start="769.59" dur="4.59">Nissan dealership you know we I want all</text>
  <text start="772.41" dur="3">folks throughout the country maybe to</text>
  <text start="774.18" dur="3">start thinking about doing some of these</text>
  <text start="775.41" dur="3.72">grassroots style initiatives on their</text>
  <text start="777.18" dur="4.02">own market being on the radio is easy</text>
  <text start="779.13" dur="3.48">what you&amp;#39;re doing is important these</text>
  <text start="781.2" dur="4.02">kind of things are really kind of</text>
  <text start="782.61" dur="6.48">grassroots driven things that most of us</text>
  <text start="785.22" dur="5.58">kind of can at least find comfort in if</text>
  <text start="789.09" dur="3.9">I hear the same people always on the</text>
  <text start="790.8" dur="4.19">network news always going like this if I</text>
  <text start="792.99" dur="3.44">turn on Sunday morning program</text>
  <text start="794.99" dur="3.81">and I&amp;#39;m gonna listen to the political</text>
  <text start="796.43" dur="5.28">shows I might as well have and I do have</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="4.71">a little thing of socks next to my chair</text>
  <text start="801.71" dur="3.81">and I&amp;#39;ve been known to throw them at</text>
  <text start="803.51" dur="3.9">them it&amp;#39;s my silent protest that what</text>
  <text start="805.52" dur="2.94">you just said is either not true or all</text>
  <text start="807.41" dur="2.55">you&amp;#39;re trying to do is hurt this</text>
  <text start="808.46" dur="2.88">president you know because if you heard</text>
  <text start="809.96" dur="3.09">the president you&amp;#39;re hurting our country</text>
  <text start="811.34" dur="3.84">I didn&amp;#39;t do that when Obama was</text>
  <text start="813.05" dur="4.17">president I wasn&amp;#39;t fond of his policies</text>
  <text start="815.18" dur="4.11">but at the same time I was not hateful</text>
  <text start="817.22" dur="3.48">towards him there&amp;#39;s a distinct hate</text>
  <text start="819.29" dur="2.82">towards this president because they</text>
  <text start="820.7" dur="3.93">tried to align him with things that</text>
  <text start="822.11" dur="4.53">really are not the messaging that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="824.63" dur="3.12">trying to do I look at the LGBT</text>
  <text start="826.64" dur="3.21">community as one of those perfect</text>
  <text start="827.75" dur="3.93">examples I was an openly gay person</text>
  <text start="829.85" dur="3.9">running his campaign in 2020 I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="831.68" dur="4.11">introduced the president on stage as an</text>
  <text start="833.75" dur="4.95">openly gay man how can you tell me this</text>
  <text start="835.79" dur="4.29">president is homophobic you know you</text>
  <text start="838.7" dur="3.09">look at someone like Hillary Clinton who</text>
  <text start="840.08" dur="3.75">takes money from money from countries</text>
  <text start="841.79" dur="4.05">that behead gay people or knock them off</text>
  <text start="843.83" dur="4.62">buildings or drown them that&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="845.84" dur="4.74">different style situation yet for some</text>
  <text start="848.45" dur="4.86">reason the gay community still thinks</text>
  <text start="850.58" dur="8.28">that the liberal left is protecting them</text>
  <text start="853.31" dur="7.59">they&amp;#39;re not and really the media and the</text>
  <text start="858.86" dur="4.5">way they portray him that is really</text>
  <text start="860.9" dur="3.81">responsible for that because a lot of</text>
  <text start="863.36" dur="3.6">times especially in today&amp;#39;s society</text>
  <text start="864.71" dur="3.69">people are so busy with their own lives</text>
  <text start="866.96" dur="4.98">that they don&amp;#39;t take it upon themselves</text>
  <text start="868.4" dur="6.39">to really look for this information they</text>
  <text start="871.94" dur="5.1">don&amp;#39;t you know listen to whole</text>
  <text start="874.79" dur="4.92">conversations or whole press conferences</text>
  <text start="877.04" dur="3.69">or look at actions they only listen to</text>
  <text start="879.71" dur="2.88">headlines</text>
  <text start="880.73" dur="3.69">yeah headlines the sound bites that are</text>
  <text start="882.59" dur="3.75">represented in the media and then</text>
  <text start="884.42" dur="4.68">whatever narrative they&amp;#39;re pushing</text>
  <text start="886.34" dur="6.35">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re picking up on so</text>
  <text start="889.1" dur="6.45">even with another example would be he is</text>
  <text start="892.69" dur="4.99">misogynist well if you look back on his</text>
  <text start="895.55" dur="5.01">track record when he was building Trump</text>
  <text start="897.68" dur="5.37">Tower back in the 80s the project</text>
  <text start="900.56" dur="4.77">manager for that was a woman oh I worked</text>
  <text start="903.05" dur="4.35">for more women during the 2016 campaign</text>
  <text start="905.33" dur="4.2">whether it was our grassroots director</text>
  <text start="907.4" dur="4.38">the director of the state other folks</text>
  <text start="909.53" dur="3.809">deputy directors all women you know</text>
  <text start="911.78" dur="2.7">because guess what women really I tell</text>
  <text start="913.339" dur="3.331">this to say this all the time women</text>
  <text start="914.48" dur="3.99">really do run the political process</text>
  <text start="916.67" dur="2.94">because they&amp;#39;re more organized</text>
  <text start="918.47" dur="2.94">they can also be somewhat more</text>
  <text start="919.61" dur="3.12">articulate and they get things done I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="921.41" dur="3.06">not saying anything against man I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="922.73" dur="3.81">saying that I work for a lot of women</text>
  <text start="924.47" dur="3.3">and I continue to engage for example</text>

  <text start="981.77" dur="4.98">do is just ride that train as long as I</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="4.56">have the opportunity to write it yeah</text>
  <text start="986.75" dur="4.05">and you know I think that what makes him</text>
  <text start="988.91" dur="3.66">so great too is not just that he cuz</text>
  <text start="990.8" dur="3.21">I&amp;#39;ve heard that he is a genuinely nice</text>
  <text start="992.57" dur="3.75">person and he really does care about</text>
  <text start="994.01" dur="5.61">people and what their issues really</text>
  <text start="996.32" dur="5.22">aren&amp;#39;t but also at the same time his</text>
  <text start="999.62" dur="3.66">principles have remained fairly stable</text>
  <text start="1001.54" dur="4.17">over the years if you look at interviews</text>
  <text start="1003.28" dur="4.92">with him from 30 years ago he&amp;#39;s seeing</text>
  <text start="1005.71" dur="4.98">the same things now that he was back</text>
  <text start="1008.2" dur="5.49">then so he wasn&amp;#39;t real flip-flop</text>
  <text start="1010.69" dur="4.11">wishy-washy which is something that you</text>
  <text start="1013.69" dur="5.19">know the American people can really</text>
  <text start="1014.8" dur="7.44">respect because historically we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1018.88" dur="4.83">gotten politicians who they run on</text>
  <text start="1022.24" dur="3.449">campaigns that they think that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1023.71" dur="3.69">the people want to hear it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="1025.689" dur="3.63">their principle right but then when they</text>
  <text start="1027.4" dur="5.25">get an office they just do whatever they</text>
  <text start="1029.319" dur="5.01">want and it&amp;#39;s not generally in the</text>
  <text start="1032.65" dur="3.12">interest of the people I think that was</text>
  <text start="1034.329" dur="4.321">one of the benefits of being able to</text>
  <text start="1035.77" dur="4.83">fund his own campaign for so long I mean</text>
  <text start="1038.65" dur="4.11">it really became we didn&amp;#39;t care about</text>
  <text start="1040.6" dur="4.02">his wealth he bragged about it at times</text>
  <text start="1042.76" dur="3.059">but it didn&amp;#39;t bother us the reason it</text>
  <text start="1044.62" dur="2.91">didn&amp;#39;t bother us because he was still</text>
  <text start="1045.819" dur="3.661">one of us every once awhile you might</text>
  <text start="1047.53" dur="3.9">throw in a cuss word just by accident</text>
  <text start="1049.48" dur="3.93">you know he was real he&amp;#39;s still real and</text>
  <text start="1051.43" dur="4.02">genuine and I think the American public</text>
  <text start="1053.41" dur="4.26">in general can really respond to a</text>
  <text start="1055.45" dur="3.93">person like that Twitter was a wonderful</text>
  <text start="1057.67" dur="3.18">thing for him because it allowed us and</text>
  <text start="1059.38" dur="1.93">it continues to allow us to have a</text>
  <text start="1060.85" dur="3.4">direct</text>
  <text start="1061.31" dur="5.07">communication with this president every</text>
  <text start="1064.25" dur="5.31">single day we didn&amp;#39;t have anything like</text>
  <text start="1066.38" dur="5.31">that under Obama Bush Clinton anything</text>
  <text start="1069.56" dur="4.05">all we saw was what the news reported</text>
  <text start="1071.69" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s why it becomes so challenging at</text>
  <text start="1073.61" dur="3.96">times when we hear what he&amp;#39;s saying we</text>
  <text start="1075.74" dur="4.17">watch what he&amp;#39;s doing and then they say</text>
  <text start="1077.57" dur="4.47">something totally different right so</text>
  <text start="1079.91" dur="4.02">speaking about the media and media bias</text>
  <text start="1082.04" dur="4.62">tell me a little bit about America first</text>
  <text start="1083.93" dur="4.62">Federation and that&amp;#39;s just another organ</text>
  <text start="1086.66" dur="3.21">another group under an umbrella to make</text>
  <text start="1088.55" dur="3.9">sure we always talk about America being</text>
  <text start="1089.87" dur="5.16">first I think that the president made</text>
  <text start="1092.45" dur="5.19">that one of his objectives early on that</text>
  <text start="1095.03" dur="5.4">we were going to be bringing jobs back</text>
  <text start="1097.64" dur="4.59">to America bringing business bringing</text>
  <text start="1100.43" dur="3.21">manufacturing all those things you know</text>
  <text start="1102.23" dur="3.18">I&amp;#39;m from Indianapolis Indiana and</text>
  <text start="1103.64" dur="3.45">recently I went up to home for my</text>
  <text start="1105.41" dur="3.57">niece&amp;#39;s graduation and I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1107.09" dur="3.99">believe how much manufacturing was going</text>
  <text start="1108.98" dur="3.3">on in Indianapolis Indiana we need to</text>
  <text start="1111.08" dur="3.21">bring some of that to Orlando Florida</text>
  <text start="1112.28" dur="4.83">but those are the types of things the</text>
  <text start="1114.29" dur="4.5">whole concept of even the hats made in</text>
  <text start="1117.11" dur="4.74">America you know those but there was a</text>
  <text start="1118.79" dur="4.95">time where I believe in the 80s we</text>
  <text start="1121.85" dur="3.96">started seeing a lot more made-in-china</text>
  <text start="1123.74" dur="3.99">on our stuff and we almost didn&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="1125.81" dur="3.72">we didn&amp;#39;t realize at the time however</text>
  <text start="1127.73" dur="3.12">what was happening whether it was with</text>
  <text start="1129.53" dur="3.45">Nissan Toyota and all these different</text>
  <text start="1130.85" dur="3.9">car manufacturers that now manufacture</text>
  <text start="1132.98" dur="3.72">in America we didn&amp;#39;t realize that we</text>
  <text start="1134.75" dur="3.54">were sending jobs away you know because</text>
  <text start="1136.7" dur="3.27">we could get those tasks done</text>
  <text start="1138.29" dur="3.54">differently and cheaply in other</text>
  <text start="1139.97" dur="3.3">countries so I&amp;#39;m glad to see us bringing</text>
  <text start="1141.83" dur="4.29">some of this stuff back to America it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1143.27" dur="6">important you know yeah it definitely is</text>
  <text start="1146.12" dur="8.73">and really recently there has been</text>
  <text start="1149.27" dur="8.64">almost this wave of people who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1154.85" dur="4.68">necessarily have a respect or a love for</text>
  <text start="1157.91" dur="4.11">the country and it&amp;#39;s almost like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1159.53" dur="6.03">trying to make it be a popular thing to</text>
  <text start="1162.02" dur="8.52">be anti-american and that&amp;#39;s that is why</text>
  <text start="1165.56" dur="6.75">it is so they justify really bashing the</text>
  <text start="1170.54" dur="2.52">president when you look at what happened</text>
  <text start="1172.31" dur="4.38">in Cincinnati</text>
  <text start="1173.06" dur="4.71">I mean Dayton and in El Paso let me</text>
  <text start="1176.69" dur="2.49">clarify that because I want to be the</text>
  <text start="1177.77" dur="3.57">person made at Rome what happened in</text>
  <text start="1179.18" dur="3.9">Dayton and what happened in El Paso and</text>
  <text start="1181.34" dur="4.35">trying to blame the president for that</text>
  <text start="1183.08" dur="5.61">rhetoric or that those attacks those</text>
  <text start="1185.69" dur="4.95">violent acts that&amp;#39;s crazy you know one</text>
  <text start="1188.69" dur="3.12">person pulled the trigger as we</text>
  <text start="1190.64" dur="2.49">understand it in both of those</text>
  <text start="1191.81" dur="2.98">situations</text>
  <text start="1193.13" dur="3.43">whoever has their hand on the trick</text>
  <text start="1194.79" dur="3.45">the one that really is the problem you</text>
  <text start="1196.56" dur="2.55">know it&amp;#39;s you know mental illness we can</text>
  <text start="1198.24" dur="2.79">go through all these different things</text>
  <text start="1199.11" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;ve been arguing online for days now it</text>
  <text start="1201.03" dur="3.87">seems it&amp;#39;s only been a couple days since</text>
  <text start="1202.44" dur="4.23">this all occurred regarding video games</text>
  <text start="1204.9" dur="2.97">and how those impact things hey when I</text>
  <text start="1206.67" dur="3.6">was growing up we had that thing that</text>
  <text start="1207.87" dur="4.89">you know pong back and forth you know</text>
  <text start="1210.27" dur="3.93">what was I can&amp;#39;t remember Atari that was</text>
  <text start="1212.76" dur="2.91">that that was the that was the most</text>
  <text start="1214.2" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re gonna get out of me as related to</text>
  <text start="1215.67" dur="4.17">watching violence unless my parents</text>
  <text start="1218.22" dur="3.27">would take me to a rated R movie today</text>
  <text start="1219.84" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s very different and so as you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1221.49" dur="2.73">growing up you&amp;#39;re seeing things very</text>
  <text start="1222.9" dur="3.24">differently I think when the president</text>
  <text start="1224.22" dur="4.35">talks about this in his comments at the</text>
  <text start="1226.14" dur="4.02">White House yesterday I believe he was</text>
  <text start="1228.57" dur="3.39">actually right you know people are</text>
  <text start="1230.16" dur="3.51">saying well Randy you know there&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="1231.96" dur="3.57">countries that have video games and they</text>
  <text start="1233.67" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t have the gun problem that we do we</text>
  <text start="1235.53" dur="3.57">live in a very free society here you</text>
  <text start="1238.02" dur="3.18">know we don&amp;#39;t wake up every day thinking</text>
  <text start="1239.1" dur="3.54">god I&amp;#39;m gonna walk into a Publix and</text>
  <text start="1241.2" dur="3.27">someone&amp;#39;s gonna shoot me you know we</text>
  <text start="1242.64" dur="3.12">just don&amp;#39;t think like that and so we</text>
  <text start="1244.47" dur="4.68">have a lot of work to do when it comes</text>
  <text start="1245.76" dur="4.83">to how we handle this moving forward and</text>
  <text start="1249.15" dur="2.4">I think the president outlined a lot of</text>
  <text start="1250.59" dur="2.19">things that I think are gonna be good</text>
  <text start="1251.55" dur="2.82">for our country I think people are gonna</text>
  <text start="1252.78" dur="3.3">get behind those in a bipartisan way</text>
  <text start="1254.37" dur="4.2">let&amp;#39;s hope that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1256.08" dur="4.32">important I hope they do although of</text>
  <text start="1258.57" dur="4.56">course they did politicize it almost</text>
  <text start="1260.4" dur="4.11">immediately and called for a gun control</text>
  <text start="1263.13" dur="2.76">you know he&amp;#39;s funny has a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1264.51" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t realize since when I was a</text>
  <text start="1265.89" dur="4.23">chairman in 2016 the president was ready</text>
  <text start="1268.23" dur="4.77">to come here after the pulse attack that</text>
  <text start="1270.12" dur="4.68">week I contacted our mayor I contacted</text>
  <text start="1273" dur="4.59">this person that person and they all</text>
  <text start="1274.8" dur="5.22">said no imagine me having to make a</text>
  <text start="1277.59" dur="3.99">phone call back to the campaign and a</text>
  <text start="1280.02" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t and a kena County that was doing</text>
  <text start="1281.58" dur="3.99">so well for him I&amp;#39;m unfortunately sorry</text>
  <text start="1283.98" dur="4.8">to let you know they don&amp;#39;t want you to</text>
  <text start="1285.57" dur="5.4">come here yet when President Obama you</text>
  <text start="1288.78" dur="3.45">know bought a Biden showed up they</text>
  <text start="1290.97" dur="3.12">immediately went to the gun control</text>
  <text start="1292.23" dur="3.84">issue when Hillary Clinton showed up in</text>
  <text start="1294.09" dur="4.08">Orlando we praised her because guess</text>
  <text start="1296.07" dur="5.07">what that was the narrative that they</text>
  <text start="1298.17" dur="5.61">wanted to to continue you know and so as</text>
  <text start="1301.14" dur="4.53">a result the bottom line is he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1303.78" dur="4.14">come you know but I hope he does go to</text>
  <text start="1305.67" dur="3.66">El Paso I hope he goes to Dayton I hope</text>
  <text start="1307.92" dur="3.09">he goes because I think those people</text>
  <text start="1309.33" dur="4.83">need to see that the president does care</text>
  <text start="1311.01" dur="6.24">about them and I think sometimes that</text>
  <text start="1314.16" dur="4.65">you know there is hate you know love</text>
  <text start="1317.25" dur="3.81">does not always conquer all I know that</text>
  <text start="1318.81" dur="3.21">we would like to think that sometimes</text>
  <text start="1321.06" dur="2.55">what you have to do is have those</text>
  <text start="1322.02" dur="2.4">difficult discussions you know and</text>
  <text start="1323.61" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="1324.42" dur="3.38">right now in this country yeah I think</text>
  <text start="1326.64" dur="4.1">that&amp;#39;s definitely true</text>
  <text start="1327.8" dur="4.59">where there seems to be more hate for</text>
  <text start="1330.74" dur="3.54">the president than love for the country</text>
  <text start="1332.39" dur="4.14">but has been somewhere you see it if</text>
  <text start="1334.28" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;re watching media I&amp;#39;m going to see</text>
  <text start="1336.53" dur="4.47">it I argue with people it seems like all</text>
  <text start="1339.17" dur="3.15">the time every day and I&amp;#39;m like what are</text>
  <text start="1341" dur="3.24">you talking about how can you keep</text>
  <text start="1342.32" dur="3.36">saying you know I it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="1344.24" dur="3.09">example his wife&amp;#39;s never on any of the</text>
  <text start="1345.68" dur="3.9">covers of any of these fashion magazines</text>
  <text start="1347.33" dur="3.87">yes she&amp;#39;s gorgeous you know she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1349.58" dur="2.46">beautiful if you&amp;#39;re going to why would</text>
  <text start="1351.2" dur="2.55">you not put her there</text>
  <text start="1352.04" dur="3.48">and the reason you don&amp;#39;t is because you</text>
  <text start="1353.75" dur="4.35">just don&amp;#39;t like him you don&amp;#39;t like their</text>
  <text start="1355.52" dur="4.89">opinions their process listen these are</text>
  <text start="1358.1" dur="4.5">wonderful people they think about this</text>
  <text start="1360.41" dur="3.9">if I had his money I&amp;#39;m not sure I would</text>
  <text start="1362.6" dur="3.81">have done it I would have been on that</text>
  <text start="1364.31" dur="4.56">beach with a pina colada on a regular</text>
  <text start="1366.41" dur="4.41">basis hanging out you know doing fun</text>
  <text start="1368.87" dur="3.24">things instead he sacrificed it all as a</text>
  <text start="1370.82" dur="3.42">matter of fact his net worth is less</text>
  <text start="1372.11" dur="4.92">than it was as I recall you know when he</text>
  <text start="1374.24" dur="4.8">was actually running for president and</text>
  <text start="1377.03" dur="4.56">that sacrifice is because he loves this</text>
  <text start="1379.04" dur="5.52">country so much right and he&amp;#39;s done so</text>
  <text start="1381.59" dur="5.46">much and even for you know the black</text>

  <text start="1516.38" dur="2.4">getting it on the floor he said well</text>
  <text start="1517.43" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s very difficult because the</text>

  <text start="1520.67" dur="4.26">this I said well that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>

  <text start="1555.8" dur="3.69">not willing to accept and certainly not</text>

  <text start="1562.97" dur="4.23">many people to get out there and run for</text>

  <text start="1573.23" dur="5.34">there and run against them right that is</text>
  <text start="1576.11" dur="4.02">definitely true we need more people who</text>
  <text start="1578.57" dur="3.3">are going to support the president and</text>
  <text start="1580.13" dur="4.05">work with him not work against them even</text>
  <text start="1581.87" dur="3.72">if you have different ideals maybe you</text>
  <text start="1584.18" dur="2.88">have different ways of thinking about</text>
  <text start="1585.59" dur="3.12">things but you know you need to be able</text>
  <text start="1587.06" dur="3.45">to come to the table for the good of</text>
  <text start="1588.71" dur="3.15">this country well I always say don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1590.51" dur="2.25">come to me with the problem come to me</text>
  <text start="1591.86" dur="2.64">with a solution</text>
  <text start="1592.76" dur="3.36">and unfortunately what we see from the</text>
  <text start="1594.5" dur="3.87">left is they&amp;#39;re just not willing to work</text>
  <text start="1596.12" dur="4.35">with this president on solutions they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1598.37" dur="3.99">much rather just attack him for maybe</text>
  <text start="1600.47" dur="3.57">making the wrong comment on a particular</text>
  <text start="1602.36" dur="3.12">day think about every time he walks out</text>
  <text start="1604.04" dur="4.29">of the White House it&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="1605.48" dur="4.86">you know marine one when he gets off the</text>
  <text start="1608.33" dur="3.63">plane or gets on Air Force One all he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1610.34" dur="3.66">always letting the media have an</text>
  <text start="1611.96" dur="4.05">opportunity with him he does have an</text>
  <text start="1614" dur="3.93">agenda and he does state it but instead</text>
  <text start="1616.01" dur="3.48">of actually listening they attack him</text>
  <text start="1617.93" dur="2.79">for every little word he might have said</text>
  <text start="1619.49" dur="3.03">you know we could have a president like</text>
  <text start="1620.72" dur="3.72">Obama who rarely did those types of</text>
  <text start="1622.52" dur="3.06">opportunities remember there was a day</text>
  <text start="1624.44" dur="2.73">where we used to have State of the Union</text>
  <text start="1625.58" dur="3.36">addresses and all these kind of things</text>
  <text start="1627.17" dur="3.72">they still do those but he does it every</text>
  <text start="1628.94" dur="4.47">day he&amp;#39;s able to tell us what the state</text>
  <text start="1630.89" dur="5.13">of this Union this constantly and</text>
  <text start="1633.41" dur="4.4">actually accurately we would never have</text>
  <text start="1636.02" dur="4.68">known what Hillary Clinton had done</text>
  <text start="1637.81" dur="4.6">during the 2016 process if Trump had</text>
  <text start="1640.7" dur="3.33">starts had not started bringing it to</text>
  <text start="1642.41" dur="5.04">our awareness we would never have known</text>
  <text start="1644.03" dur="5.1">how corrupt the the FBI is sometimes and</text>
  <text start="1647.45" dur="3.09">some of the other organizations really</text>
  <text start="1649.13" dur="2.52">and truly were and we know this now</text>
  <text start="1650.54" dur="3.87">because we&amp;#39;ve got to watch those</text>
  <text start="1651.65" dur="5.04">hearings we&amp;#39;ve seen that in some ways</text>
  <text start="1654.41" dur="4.89">they really did strategize against that</text>
  <text start="1656.69" dur="5.67">president that very president that 63</text>
  <text start="1659.3" dur="5.94">million people voted for so I kind of</text>
  <text start="1662.36" dur="4.83">look at it and say you know people I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1665.24" dur="3.93">met with many pastors over the time and</text>
  <text start="1667.19" dur="4.65">I say you know he was God given to us in</text>
  <text start="1669.17" dur="4.05">so many ways because in any other time</text>
  <text start="1671.84" dur="3.51">in history would have never had an</text>
  <text start="1673.22" dur="3.87">opportunity to be able to learn the</text>
  <text start="1675.35" dur="2.88">truth now we know the truth and we can</text>
  <text start="1677.09" dur="3.09">talk about it just like you and I are</text>
  <text start="1678.23" dur="3.57">today we weren&amp;#39;t able to do that</text>
  <text start="1680.18" dur="3.6">probably eight years ago a little bit</text>
  <text start="1681.8" dur="3.78">more complicated yeah I think what</text>
  <text start="1683.78" dur="3.93">happened with Hillary Clinton and they</text>
  <text start="1685.58" dur="3.93">emails that never we would have never</text>
  <text start="1687.71" dur="4.74">known I&amp;#39;ve ever known and now I want to</text>
  <text start="1689.51" dur="4.77">I want to engage in that and say could</text>
  <text start="1692.45" dur="4.26">it happen under Bush could it happened</text>
  <text start="1694.28" dur="4.37">under Clinton who knows how long the</text>
  <text start="1696.71" dur="4.14">history of these challenges goes back</text>
  <text start="1698.65" dur="3.79">but more importantly what we do have is</text>
  <text start="1700.85" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;ve got this amazing president that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1702.44" dur="3.84">willing to give it one more try you know</text>
  <text start="1704.54" dur="4.59">and we&amp;#39;ve got to be behind him 150</text>
  <text start="1706.28" dur="4.5">percent you know this traveling to all</text>
  <text start="1709.13" dur="3.51">the rallies you know my goal is to</text>
  <text start="1710.78" dur="3.69">travel to all 67 counties in the next</text>
  <text start="1712.64" dur="3.09">few months meet with all the folks that</text>
  <text start="1714.47" dur="3.24">are working from the party perspective</text>
  <text start="1715.73" dur="3.36">as well as the campaign because guess</text>
  <text start="1717.71" dur="3.24">what I don&amp;#39;t want any never Trump errs</text>
  <text start="1719.09" dur="3.96">on this campaign you know so I&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="1720.95" dur="4.26">to them I&amp;#39;ll learn very quickly you know</text>
  <text start="1723.05" dur="3.09">are you on the side of the country this</text>
  <text start="1725.21" dur="2.31">president</text>
  <text start="1726.14" dur="2.91">are you here just for a job because if</text>
  <text start="1727.52" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re here just for a job you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1729.05" dur="4.92">probably not the right person yeah I</text>
  <text start="1731.09" dur="5.28">completely agree so how can people</text>
  <text start="1733.97" dur="4.83">become more involved in this process you</text>
  <text start="1736.37" dur="4.8">know I I wrote this article recently</text>
  <text start="1738.8" dur="4.11">called your political political love</text>
  <text start="1741.17" dur="4.2">language and I&amp;#39;m sure many people know</text>
  <text start="1742.91" dur="4.41">the book your love language right and I</text>
  <text start="1745.37" dur="3.57">kind of tried to correlate it to you</text>

  <text start="1753.41" dur="2.91">parties I don&amp;#39;t know you might be a</text>
  <text start="1755.06" dur="2.88">social media warrior</text>
  <text start="1756.32" dur="3.54">everybody has to identify what their</text>
  <text start="1757.94" dur="4.05">political love language is first and</text>
  <text start="1759.86" dur="4.08">then be able to look through their</text>
  <text start="1761.99" dur="4.56">social media and share things that</text>
  <text start="1763.94" dur="4.53">really are relevant and true I rarely</text>
  <text start="1766.55" dur="3.69">share anything on social media that</text>
  <text start="1768.47" dur="4.14">really is a negative towards the</text>
  <text start="1770.24" dur="3.96">president I created Facebook pages I</text>
  <text start="1772.61" dur="3.87">encourage people to create small groups</text>
  <text start="1774.2" dur="4.2">have parties at your house little small</text>
  <text start="1776.48" dur="3.3">cocktail gatherings talk about what you</text>
  <text start="1778.4" dur="3.48">agree with and what you don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="1779.78" dur="4.32">you know and find a way to do that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1781.88" dur="4.11">obviously created events in the black</text>
  <text start="1784.1" dur="3.51">community I&amp;#39;m having a vent coming up</text>
  <text start="1785.99" dur="3.51">September 12th and Hispanic community</text>
  <text start="1787.61" dur="3.75">because guess what we can&amp;#39;t just say</text>
  <text start="1789.5" dur="3.42">we&amp;#39;re going to engage minorities we have</text>
  <text start="1791.36" dur="3.3">to go in their communities and engage</text>
  <text start="1792.92" dur="3.72">them and that&amp;#39;s important I think people</text>
  <text start="1794.66" dur="3.78">need to do that you know so find find</text>
  <text start="1796.64" dur="4.05">your political loved language that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1798.44" dur="7.11">what I say to people whole time I agree</text>
  <text start="1800.69" dur="7.05">so burning question recently you toyed</text>
  <text start="1805.55" dur="6">with the idea mentioning the idea of</text>
  <text start="1807.74" dur="6.42">running for Congress so what are your</text>
  <text start="1811.55" dur="4.71">thoughts on that you know sometimes</text>
  <text start="1814.16" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re more powerful behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="1816.26" dur="3.45">than you are being an elected official</text>
  <text start="1818.06" dur="3.51">because elect officials think about what</text>
  <text start="1819.71" dur="3.45">Darren Soto Bal Deming Stephanie Murphy</text>
  <text start="1821.57" dur="4.92">are doing they&amp;#39;re playing to Nancy</text>

  <text start="1826.49" dur="3.6">kind of space have Ickes launched an</text>
  <text start="1828.29" dur="2.64">exploratory committee to look into this</text>
  <text start="1830.09" dur="2.97">opportunity</text>
  <text start="1830.93" dur="4.49">yeah there&amp;#39;s two maybe three different</text>
  <text start="1833.06" dur="6.06">congressional seats that touch Orlando</text>
  <text start="1835.42" dur="5.83">that I am I am looking at but you know</text>
  <text start="1839.12" dur="4.86">that requires a lot of fun raising a car</text>
  <text start="1841.25" dur="4.2">at quiet requires a lot of time for</text>
  <text start="1843.98" dur="4.2">right now what I&amp;#39;m going to do is focus</text>
  <text start="1845.45" dur="4.68">on engaging folks throughout the state</text>
  <text start="1848.18" dur="3.45">of Florida in this process of supporting</text>
  <text start="1850.13" dur="3.48">this president it&amp;#39;s gonna be tough we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1851.63" dur="4.95">got the left out there you know their</text>
  <text start="1853.61" dur="5.16">goal is a million new folks a registered</text>
  <text start="1856.58" dur="2.57">to vote we don&amp;#39;t have that going on on</text>
  <text start="1858.77" dur="2.12">the right</text>
  <text start="1859.15" dur="3.21">so I have to hope that we can engage</text>
  <text start="1860.89" dur="2.7">Democrats and independents and</text>
  <text start="1862.36" dur="3.42">independents really are where the</text>
  <text start="1863.59" dur="3.39">success story is sitting for the 2020</text>
  <text start="1865.78" dur="3.38">election I don&amp;#39;t care if it&amp;#39;s a local</text>
  <text start="1866.98" dur="4.65">election or a national election</text>
  <text start="1869.16" dur="4.6">independents hold the power so we have</text>
  <text start="1871.63" dur="3.179">to do is get them to come to our side of</text>
  <text start="1873.76" dur="3.36">thinking even if they don&amp;#39;t change</text>
  <text start="1874.809" dur="4.621">parties to make sure that they support</text>
  <text start="1877.12" dur="4.35">and get them involved in this president</text>
  <text start="1879.43" dur="4.59">so we&amp;#39;ll see what that means I can tell</text>
  <text start="1881.47" dur="4.2">you this without Congress that supports</text>
  <text start="1884.02" dur="4.14">this president we&amp;#39;re gonna fight another</text>
  <text start="1885.67" dur="4.26">four years so we need to flip Congress</text>
  <text start="1888.16" dur="3.6">so that it support it has more</text>
  <text start="1889.93" dur="4.35">Republicans than it does you know we had</text>
  <text start="1891.76" dur="4.71">a chance we had that back in 2016 and we</text>
  <text start="1894.28" dur="3.69">blew it so now we need to make sure we</text>
  <text start="1896.47" dur="3.27">give the president the tools and the</text>
  <text start="1897.97" dur="3.12">army that he needs to get this goal</text>
  <text start="1899.74" dur="3.21">accomplished and that is a Congress</text>
