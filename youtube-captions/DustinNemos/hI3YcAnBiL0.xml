  <text start="14.58" dur="4.39">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="16.779" dur="5.91">emos and this is your daily Magga and</text>
  <text start="18.97" dur="6.69">cue update first Syrian and Russian news</text>
  <text start="22.689" dur="5.851">the OPCW investigators arrived in</text>
  <text start="25.66" dur="6.119">Damascus as Moscow insisted the white</text>
  <text start="28.54" dur="5.789">helmets stage the gas attack both Syria</text>
  <text start="31.779" dur="4.8">and Russia called for an OPCW inquiry</text>
  <text start="34.329" dur="3.961">into the attacks while Russia has</text>
  <text start="36.579" dur="4.591">claimed that it has evidence US backed</text>
  <text start="38.29" dur="5.039">white helmets a u.s. funded humanitarian</text>
  <text start="41.17" dur="4.409">NGO long applauded by the mainstream</text>
  <text start="43.329" dur="4.26">media for its efforts had a hand in</text>
  <text start="45.579" dur="4.35">fabricating evidence the US State</text>
  <text start="47.589" dur="4.351">Department meanwhile has asserted that</text>
  <text start="49.929" dur="4.02">it has proof the Syrian government was</text>
  <text start="51.94" dur="3.66">behind the attack though it is neglected</text>
  <text start="53.949" dur="3.14">to release any details about this</text>
  <text start="55.6" dur="4.529">purported proof to the public</text>
  <text start="57.089" dur="4.93">furthermore the US has blamed Russia for</text>
  <text start="60.129" dur="3.78">failing to insure the chemical weapons</text>
  <text start="62.019" dur="7.651">stockpiles in Syria have been destroyed</text>
  <text start="63.909" dur="8.401">for RT the same OPCW of course is</text>
  <text start="69.67" dur="4.8">involved in the sky poles investigation</text>
  <text start="72.31" dur="5.01">and Russia&amp;#39;s pretty angry with them</text>
  <text start="74.47" dur="5.25">about that saying they&amp;#39;re faking stuff</text>
  <text start="77.32" dur="4.92">no Russian assets or soldiers were hurt</text>
  <text start="79.72" dur="6.33">in these strikes so they are kind of</text>
  <text start="82.24" dur="4.77">calm for now they are basically coming</text>
  <text start="86.05" dur="3.24">out and saying that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="87.01" dur="5.93">reconsidering a past idea that they had</text>
  <text start="89.29" dur="6">kind of put aside to arm Syria with the</text>
  <text start="92.94" dur="5.56">s-300 systems which is a kind of an</text>
  <text start="95.29" dur="5.61">anti-air missile defense system now</text>
  <text start="98.5" dur="4.2">worth mentioning I think the u.s. fun</text>
  <text start="100.9" dur="6.45">and allies just fired a little over a</text>
  <text start="102.7" dur="6.63">hundred missiles and with the old I</text>
  <text start="107.35" dur="5.1">think it has 200 systems that Syria has</text>
  <text start="109.33" dur="5.94">now they were able to shoot down over 70</text>
  <text start="112.45" dur="4.52">of those missiles so that&amp;#39;s 70 plus</text>
  <text start="115.27" dur="5.67">percent</text>
  <text start="116.97" dur="6.34">odds of countering missile strikes so if</text>
  <text start="120.94" dur="4.68">they get the annuit improved s-300 I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="123.31" dur="4.29">sure that that number will go up and</text>
  <text start="125.62" dur="4.79">it&amp;#39;ll be much more difficult to get</text>
  <text start="127.6" dur="2.81">missiles through to them</text>
  <text start="130.749" dur="4.531">curiously and I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="132.79" dur="5.61">related but it&amp;#39;s you know timing time is</text>
  <text start="135.28" dur="5.819">kind of coincidental airstrikes</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="6.209">targeting Iranian militants in jabal as</text>
  <text start="141.099" dur="5.34">on in northern aleppo countryside the</text>
  <text start="144.609" dur="3.96">sources basically of these missile</text>
  <text start="146.439" dur="4.17">strikes remain unknown but the timing</text>
  <text start="148.569" dur="5.941">like I said awfully close to what</text>
  <text start="150.609" dur="7.891">happened in Syria now as reported over</text>
  <text start="154.51" dur="6.569">the past five years Syria is a source</text>
  <text start="158.5" dur="5.219">and destination country for men women</text>
  <text start="161.079" dur="6.74">and children subjected to forced labor</text>
  <text start="163.719" dur="7.08">and sex trafficking this is a state gov</text>
  <text start="167.819" dur="5.38">article you know there&amp;#39;s been kind of an</text>
  <text start="170.799" dur="5.37">ongoing human trafficking investigation</text>
  <text start="173.199" dur="6.18">going on and you can see their report</text>
  <text start="176.169" dur="5.91">and I&amp;#39;ve got the link below and an</text>
  <text start="179.379" dur="5.94">independent Swiss lab says the BZ toxin</text>
  <text start="182.079" dur="7.83">used in this rifle poisoning is US and</text>
  <text start="185.319" dur="6.59">UK produced it&amp;#39;s not Russian so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="189.909" dur="5.28">gonna move on to politics the culture</text>
  <text start="191.909" dur="6.1">Schumer basically has been attacking</text>
  <text start="195.189" dur="6.54">Trump about Facebook defending Facebook</text>
  <text start="198.009" dur="5.22">and also as recently in the past couple</text>

  <text start="231.91" dur="3.54">separate video because this issue is</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="8.22">gonna be big for a lot of people in the</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="10.41">pro cannabis area of society but Trump</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="7.44">was having some of sessions nominations</text>
  <text start="245.86" dur="5.909">to the DOJ blocked by Republican</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="5.969">Colorado Republican Gardner Cory Kathy</text>
  <text start="251.769" dur="6.03">Cory Gardner and basically he started</text>
  <text start="255.099" dur="4.741">blocking nominations because sessions</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="4.261">started going after weed or saying that</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="3.84">he was going after we in Colorado&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="263.68" dur="3.9">marijuana which I don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="7.56">taxing it but it&amp;#39;s better than putting</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="7.08">people in prison for it so he basically</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="4.71">Cory Gardner made a deal with the Trump</text>
