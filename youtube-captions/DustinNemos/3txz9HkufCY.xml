  <text start="21.63" dur="6.84">started back in Christmas Eve 2017 and</text>
  <text start="25.56" dur="4.68">had built a following of 42 thousand</text>
  <text start="28.47" dur="2.58">subscribers within two months believe it</text>
  <text start="30.24" dur="3.78">or not</text>

  <text start="46.17" dur="3.84">things a little bit and there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="48.21" dur="4.41">useful features that you may want to</text>
  <text start="50.01" dur="5.99">take advantage of especially if and when</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="6.209">they ban me again so without further ado</text>

  <text start="72.36" dur="4.86">lot of confusion about that for some</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="4.949">reason and mostly there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="4.5">things just on the homepage that I want</text>
  <text start="79.049" dur="5.341">you to be aware of first of course is</text>
  <text start="81.72" dur="5.399">this button up here at the top that says</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="4.86">support my work if you&amp;#39;re interested in</text>
  <text start="87.119" dur="4.951">supporting this or finding any value in</text>
  <text start="89.25" dur="5.159">the work that I do then that option will</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="5.1">take you to my support page I have a</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="6.091">couple of you know available options</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="6.14">there I have patreon and I have donor</text>
  <text start="100.5" dur="5.82">box donor box is actually pretty neat</text>
  <text start="103.31" dur="5.5">they&amp;#39;re based off of the stripe platform</text>
  <text start="106.32" dur="5.64">and you know they actually allow for</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="4.589">one-time or recurring donations they</text>
  <text start="111.96" dur="3.81">have a lower fee than patreon pretty</text>
  <text start="113.399" dur="4.32">neat of course I love crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="3.72">I have my Bitcoin listed here but if you</text>

  <text start="119.49" dur="2.729">to send me I can send you a link for</text>
  <text start="121.649" dur="4.591">that as well</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="5.701">and ask for things like PayPal and</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="5.13">GoFundMe which are very popular choices</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="5.23">they ban me in fact GoFundMe banned me</text>
  <text start="131.37" dur="4.42">at the same time YouTube&amp;#39;s dead as part</text>
  <text start="133.15" dur="3.089">of their little perch so can&amp;#39;t help you</text>
  <text start="135.79" dur="2.58">there</text>
  <text start="136.239" dur="4.681">wish that I could but unfortunately</text>
  <text start="138.37" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s just the way that they act that</text>
  <text start="140.92" dur="5.7">this the nature of the beast that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="142.48" dur="5.789">fighting here now I down here on the</text>
  <text start="146.62" dur="4.589">right you&amp;#39;ll see this thing called power</text>
  <text start="148.269" dur="5.701">plugins this is a direct feed from my</text>
  <text start="151.209" dur="4.5">Twitter and very nifty tool because I</text>
  <text start="153.97" dur="3.56">post a lot of things on Twitter that I</text>
  <text start="155.709" dur="4.5">may not include in the videos and you</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="4.929">can always just kind of check this out</text>
  <text start="160.209" dur="5.071">and scroll through and get a good idea</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="4.831">of what&amp;#39;s going on in the world now this</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="3.84">video right here that&amp;#39;s no longer</text>
  <text start="167.29" dur="4.589">available is actually my original</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="5.399">introduction video that I&amp;#39;m redoing now</text>
  <text start="171.879" dur="4.26">and it was on my band account so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.519" dur="3.661">gone and I&amp;#39;m gonna put the video I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="176.139" dur="5.611">making them right now in this spot right</text>
  <text start="178.18" dur="5.82">here down here I have just a little bit</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="5.099">of a blog an article area</text>
  <text start="184" dur="4.079">I don&amp;#39;t update it every day I try to</text>
  <text start="186.849" dur="3.961">update it when there&amp;#39;s when there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.079" dur="4.201">major stuff but honestly just the</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="4.289">research has kept me so busy that I</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="4.859">haven&amp;#39;t been able to do this part</text>
  <text start="195.099" dur="4.14">justice hopefully in the future I can be</text>
  <text start="197.139" dur="5.28">a little bit better about that and then</text>
  <text start="199.239" dur="5.28">down here there is a box we can put in</text>
  <text start="202.419" dur="4.741">your email and you can get you can</text>
  <text start="204.519" dur="4.741">choose HTML or text which generally I</text>
  <text start="207.16" dur="4.74">only send text if I send an email and</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="4.68">this will let you subscribe to my email</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="4.199">list in case for example I get banned</text>
  <text start="213.94" dur="3.689">again and then I&amp;#39;ll still be able to</text>
  <text start="216.099" dur="4.23">reach out to you through email and send</text>
  <text start="217.629" dur="5.19">you a update to where I&amp;#39;m at now but of</text>
  <text start="220.329" dur="5.28">course you should be able to always find</text>
  <text start="222.819" dur="4.53">me here on destiny most calm and down</text>
  <text start="225.609" dur="3.72">here at the very bottom you can go and</text>
  <text start="227.349" dur="3.661">check out these icons there&amp;#39;s a little F</text>
  <text start="229.329" dur="3.9">in the little bird and obviously that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.01" dur="3.18">my Facebook and Twitter but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="233.229" dur="3.66">little frog</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="5.039">that&amp;#39;s my gab which is more of a</text>
  <text start="236.889" dur="4.47">free-speech version and alternative to</text>
  <text start="239.229" dur="5.13">Facebook and Twitter they&amp;#39;re the real</text>
  <text start="241.359" dur="4.56">deal because even Apple tried to ban</text>
  <text start="244.359" dur="2.91">them from the App Store and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="245.919" dur="4.201">everybody&amp;#39;s trying to make it difficult</text>
  <text start="247.269" dur="4.321">to get gab or to get to let gab get the</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="3.899">word out that they are a free speech</text>
  <text start="251.59" dur="3.739">platform so gab is gonna replace</text>
  <text start="254.019" dur="5.881">Facebook and Twitter</text>
  <text start="255.329" dur="6.34">sooner or later you&amp;#39;ve also got my video</text>

  <text start="269.05" dur="4.35">can actually click on these and they</text>
  <text start="271" dur="5.25">will take you to the relevant platform</text>
  <text start="273.4" dur="5.16">so for example I click on that V right</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="6.75">here open up another tab and it brings</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="6.48">me right over to my Vimeo this is a paid</text>
  <text start="283" dur="5.18">service but I didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of</text>
  <text start="285.04" dur="5.34">options I wanted to give a good quality</text>
  <text start="288.18" dur="5.56">platform for people to watch my videos</text>
  <text start="290.38" dur="7.29">after I was banned and this was a good</text>
  <text start="293.74" dur="7.44">option of course I also have bitch shoot</text>
  <text start="297.67" dur="4.83">and D tube which are decentralized so</text>
