  <text start="37.18" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re gonna dive into some really scary</text>
  <text start="38.95" dur="4.77">stuff in the economy yeah it&amp;#39;s bad news</text>
  <text start="41.89" dur="4.2">for most folks but not for you because</text>
  <text start="43.72" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re aware of it so take some optimism</text>

  <text start="48.49" dur="4.98">run with it because there&amp;#39;s a lot going</text>
  <text start="50.2" dur="6.81">on Oh God alright but you were gonna ask</text>
  <text start="53.47" dur="5.97">me questions but I would say that the</text>
  <text start="57.01" dur="5.67">biggest key shift that I&amp;#39;m paying a lot</text>
  <text start="59.44" dur="6.99">of attention to is the rise in global</text>
  <text start="62.68" dur="5.61">interest rates even as globally central</text>
  <text start="66.43" dur="5.7">banks have been pushing interest rates</text>
  <text start="68.29" dur="7.28">down the markets seem to be pushing them</text>
  <text start="72.13" dur="6.989">up and that really threatens the</text>
  <text start="75.57" dur="7">enormous mountain of debt and debt</text>
  <text start="79.119" dur="6.601">derivatives that are out there so I</text>
  <text start="82.57" dur="6.18">would say that for me that&amp;#39;s the most</text>
  <text start="85.72" dur="6.06">key shift that I&amp;#39;m observing at this</text>
  <text start="88.75" dur="4.62">point in time now there there is a lot</text>
  <text start="91.78" dur="3.93">going on I do have some questions I know</text>
  <text start="93.37" dur="4.47">even Ron Paul is speaking out he thinks</text>
  <text start="95.71" dur="4.47">that the bubble may be popping yeah</text>
  <text start="97.84" dur="4.56">where do you see that right now in terms</text>
  <text start="100.18" dur="4.41">of us going into 2020 I know that</text>
  <text start="102.4" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s the election stuff happening do</text>
  <text start="104.59" dur="3.66">you see this popping before after I know</text>
  <text start="106.57" dur="5.88">that it&amp;#39;s always hard to pick that but</text>
  <text start="108.25" dur="7.47">why it really is hard to pick exactly</text>
  <text start="112.45" dur="5.279">what&amp;#39;s going on because the at the same</text>
  <text start="115.72" dur="5.399">time that I see the interest rates</text>
  <text start="117.729" dur="6.841">rising which really does prick the debt</text>
  <text start="121.119" dur="6.391">bubble you know there&amp;#39;s so much new</text>
  <text start="124.57" dur="5.46">money sloshing around the system</text>
  <text start="127.51" dur="6.03">you know central banks especially the</text>
  <text start="130.03" dur="5.37">Fed is in full bore anybody can go to</text>
  <text start="133.54" dur="4.41">the Federal Reserve balance sheet on the</text>
  <text start="135.4" dur="4.71">Federal Reserve and every week it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="137.95" dur="4.41">I show I show everybody every week but</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s just going you know pretty much at</text>
  <text start="142.36" dur="6">the same look pretty close to the same</text>
  <text start="144.49" dur="6.33">level that it did in the crisis of 2008</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="5.37">so you know they can tell you everything</text>
  <text start="150.82" dur="6.87">is hunky-dory but another thing that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="7.26">hearing actually a bit of is mainstream</text>
  <text start="157.69" dur="6.96">media is starting to talk about a melt</text>
  <text start="160.99" dur="5.76">up where there&amp;#39;s so much money that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.65" dur="5.4">sloshing around that money has to go</text>
  <text start="166.75" dur="5.22">someplace and where&amp;#39;s it going to go</text>
  <text start="170.05" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s going to go through the banks into</text>
  <text start="171.97" dur="4.92">stocks not into bonds at the moment so</text>
  <text start="175.33" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s a lot of money coming out of</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="7.53">bonds but you know into stocks so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="180.13" dur="5.97">pushing that market up because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="184.42" dur="2.58">think people think they have any other</text>
  <text start="186.1" dur="2.52">choice</text>
  <text start="187" dur="3.57">in the meantime you&amp;#39;ve got a lot of cash</text>
  <text start="188.62" dur="4.38">sitting on the sidelines but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.57" dur="4.41">really the smart money I mean I can tell</text>
  <text start="193" dur="4.739">you for a fact I am NOT buying stocks</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="4.53">today sure and you know as you say a lot</text>
  <text start="197.739" dur="3.421">of people don&amp;#39;t know what else to do</text>
  <text start="199.51" dur="3.84">with it I mean we have been taught gold</text>
  <text start="201.16" dur="5.01">and silver is a barbarous relic I think</text>
  <text start="203.35" dur="4.44">and no central banks are stocking it now</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="3.72">and talking about in some cases that</text>
  <text start="207.79" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the risa default money it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.89" dur="5.43">the in case anything else happens money</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="5.28">and you know we as Americans could see</text>
  <text start="215.32" dur="2.88">that and when that happens I think a lot</text>
  <text start="217.18" dur="2.73">of things will be pulled out of the</text>
  <text start="218.2" dur="4.259">stock market and they&amp;#39;ll go that way but</text>
  <text start="219.91" dur="5.19">you know we&amp;#39;re gonna that pain first</text>
  <text start="222.459" dur="4.771">right well yeah but Dustin you&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="225.1" dur="4.46">making the assumption that you have the</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="5.64">ability to do that when in reality</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="7.63">whatever assets are in this the amount</text>
  <text start="232.87" dur="7.14">of stocks in the market is dwarfed by</text>
  <text start="237.19" dur="5.88">the amount of all of these indexes and</text>
  <text start="240.01" dur="7.14">which is a derivative and derivatives</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="5.97">and ETFs and et NS and all of these you</text>
  <text start="247.15" dur="5.46">know vegetable soup products that have</text>
  <text start="249.04" dur="7.08">been created and leveraged any equity</text>
  <text start="252.61" dur="4.47">that is in there yeah it&amp;#39;s all ruined I</text>
  <text start="256.12" dur="2.25">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t mean that</text>
  <text start="257.08" dur="2.52">to clarify I don&amp;#39;t mean that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="2.88">gonna pull their money out of the stock</text>
  <text start="259.6" dur="5.46">market when it&amp;#39;s all crashed and go to</text>
  <text start="261.25" dur="5.37">gold I think people&amp;#39;s their their energy</text>
  <text start="265.06" dur="3.359">the percentage of their energy that goes</text>
  <text start="266.62" dur="3.359">into things like gold and silver are</text>
  <text start="268.419" dur="3.391">gonna start to skyrocket because of</text>
  <text start="269.979" dur="3.541">interest and things like that so you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="3.54">start to see new habits forming where</text>
  <text start="273.52" dur="3.959">people start to plug away gold and</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="4.319">silver or cash like a million your</text>
  <text start="277.479" dur="4.111">depression rather than the stock and</text>
  <text start="279.669" dur="4.171">stuff but so</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="3.87">we were talking about the debt and how</text>
  <text start="283.84" dur="2.79">the Fed is just printing printing</text>
  <text start="285.46" dur="3.81">printing they can&amp;#39;t as you said</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="4.17">skyrocketing trends there and that can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.27" dur="4.17">last forever that that seems to be a</text>
  <text start="290.8" dur="4.2">pretty scary recent trend we talked</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="4.86">briefly before about the repo and the</text>
  <text start="295" dur="4.95">CLO thing what do you have for us there</text>
  <text start="298.3" dur="3.6">I mean you follow this more closely even</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="3.54">than I do and I trust your your judgment</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="3.81">and many of the viewers here trust your</text>
  <text start="303.49" dur="4.44">judgment pretty well so thank you what</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="5.31">do you have going on there well really</text>
  <text start="307.93" dur="6.69">what we&amp;#39;re seeing is you know just like</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="5.76">the qyz hid the real problem in the</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="4.62">market so that the people didn&amp;#39;t see it</text>
  <text start="316.78" dur="5.37">right it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it went away</text>
  <text start="319.24" dur="5.91">because it didn&amp;#39;t this new level of</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="5.67">printing takes us back to those periods</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="5.7">of time and what they&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="327.82" dur="6.99">not let you who put your money in money</text>
  <text start="330.85" dur="6.54">markets and think it&amp;#39;s safe know that</text>
  <text start="334.81" dur="5.1">the financial global the plumbing of the</text>
  <text start="337.39" dur="5.07">financial global system has actually</text>
  <text start="339.91" dur="5.61">frozen and that there is a lack of</text>
  <text start="342.46" dur="6.48">confidence bank-to-bank which is why the</text>
  <text start="345.52" dur="6.48">feds have to step in so I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="348.94" dur="6">scared to death I think it&amp;#39;s only you</text>
  <text start="352" dur="6.87">know it&amp;#39;s already unraveling but having</text>
  <text start="354.94" dur="5.43">said that by printing this money you</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="4.47">know people are watching the stock</text>
  <text start="360.37" dur="5.85">market they open their 401k statements</text>
  <text start="363.34" dur="5.91">if it looks ok it must be ok by the time</text>
  <text start="366.22" dur="5.22">you open it and it doesn&amp;#39;t look ok it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.25" dur="5.4">going to be too late to make any choices</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="5.85">so you know as you said your habit of</text>
  <text start="374.65" dur="4.68">buying gold and silver that&amp;#39;s a much</text>
  <text start="377.29" dur="6.06">better habit to have today at these</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="6.42">price levels like we see a you know the</text>
  <text start="383.35" dur="6.09">Central Bank&amp;#39;s Doing and JP Morgan with</text>
  <text start="385.75" dur="6.27">the silver etc accumulate it do what the</text>
  <text start="389.44" dur="5.7">smartest guys in the room is doing but</text>
  <text start="392.02" dur="5.43">yeah they&amp;#39;re petrified they&amp;#39;re petrified</text>
  <text start="395.14" dur="4.11">yeah and and you&amp;#39;re starting to see some</text>
  <text start="397.45" dur="3.54">some breaking into ranks with central</text>
  <text start="399.25" dur="3.33">banks and as I said promoting gold even</text>
  <text start="400.99" dur="3.36">it sounds like you know what do you</text>
  <text start="402.58" dur="2.91">think is going on between the central</text>
  <text start="404.35" dur="4.98">banks of the different international</text>
  <text start="405.49" dur="6.54">powers-that-be well you know there there</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="6.28">are actually that and also there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="412.03" dur="5.229">huge dissension amongst those kind</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="4.079">trees that have been experiencing</text>
  <text start="417.259" dur="6.451">negative rates for a very long time</text>
  <text start="419.689" dur="6.841">saying this does not work no it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="6.449">it kills the traditional banking system</text>
  <text start="426.53" dur="6.569">you know and and so banks also go out</text>
  <text start="430.159" dur="7.081">and take more and more and more risks</text>
  <text start="433.099" dur="6.72">and this morning I heard President Trump</text>
  <text start="437.24" dur="5.04">talking about we need those negative</text>
  <text start="439.819" dur="5.791">rates give them to me give him to me the</text>
  <text start="442.28" dur="6.479">New York the San Francisco Fed did a</text>
  <text start="445.61" dur="5.279">recent piece justifying the negative</text>
  <text start="448.759" dur="4.71">rates at a time when those that are</text>
  <text start="450.889" dur="5.071">living through it are saying this is not</text>
  <text start="453.469" dur="5.491">working so really we&amp;#39;re worse than</text>
  <text start="455.96" dur="6.72">between a rock and a hard place because</text>
  <text start="458.96" dur="6.09">keeping the rates in this low and even</text>
  <text start="462.68" dur="5.099">going into more negative territory which</text>
  <text start="465.05" dur="4.799">I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;re going we&amp;#39;re going to end</text>
  <text start="467.779" dur="7.44">up there they don&amp;#39;t have any more tools</text>
  <text start="469.849" dur="7.951">is creating all of it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="475.219" dur="5.431">insanity we&amp;#39;re like in the twilight zone</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="4.739">on the other side of that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.65" dur="3.87">raising the rates which now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="482.539" dur="4.44">saying how good that is and even the</text>
  <text start="484.52" dur="5.13">stock market is appearing to like it</text>
  <text start="486.979" dur="6.69">with lots of buybacks and things but</text>
  <text start="489.65" dur="6.59">still what happens to all of that debt</text>
  <text start="493.669" dur="6.601">that&amp;#39;s been accumulated by iffy</text>
  <text start="496.24" dur="6.489">corporations that their income to pay</text>
  <text start="500.27" dur="5.669">that debt is down and they&amp;#39;ve just been</text>
  <text start="502.729" dur="5.49">servicing it by taking on more debt like</text>
  <text start="505.939" dur="4.051">if you had a credit card and as long as</text>
  <text start="508.219" dur="3.75">somebody will keep giving you credit</text>
  <text start="509.99" dur="4.229">cards and you just keep transferring the</text>
  <text start="511.969" dur="5.221">balance and transferring the balance</text>
  <text start="514.219" dur="5.671">well if you can keep doing that then I</text>
  <text start="517.19" dur="5.07">guess you can keep hidden the fact that</text>
  <text start="519.89" dur="5.61">you&amp;#39;re getting into more and more and</text>
  <text start="522.26" dur="6.54">more trouble but what happens when they</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="5.579">say no more credit cards for you how are</text>
  <text start="528.8" dur="4.11">you gonna deal with all of that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="531.079" dur="4.531">going to implode and you&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="4.53">bankrupt and live under a bridge do you</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="4.229">think that there&amp;#39;s any benefit to a weak</text>
  <text start="537.44" dur="3.87">dollar in that case where President</text>
  <text start="539.839" dur="3.69">Trump is saying you know like negative</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="3.57">or you know low interest rates you know</text>
  <text start="543.529" dur="3.571">give me give me that kind of thing does</text>
  <text start="544.88" dur="3.689">it help us even to stave off for a short</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="1.65">term because I feel like Tron knows what</text>
  <text start="548.569" dur="3.181">he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.75" dur="5.85">doing there must be a reason for now you</text>
  <text start="551.75" dur="5.34">know the dollar it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like the best</text>
  <text start="554.6" dur="6.87">horse and the glue factory except we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="557.09" dur="6.93">all in the glue factory yeah so by</text>
  <text start="561.47" dur="4.52">having rates that are higher I know</text>
  <text start="564.02" dur="4.43">but by having rates that are higher than</text>
  <text start="565.99" dur="6.73">lots of other people in the EU</text>
  <text start="568.45" dur="8.44">Switzerland etc then it is more</text>
  <text start="572.72" dur="6.63">attractive to buy dollars however look</text>
  <text start="576.89" dur="4.71">at that purchasing power chart you may</text>
  <text start="579.35" dur="5.58">see the dollar against other currencies</text>
  <text start="581.6" dur="5.46">go like this but the dollar in terms of</text>
  <text start="584.93" dur="5.28">purchasing power is pretty consistently</text>
  <text start="587.06" dur="6.78">just going down down down it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="590.21" dur="5.88">like 3.8 cents out of the original</text>
  <text start="593.84" dur="4.29">dollars worth of purchasing power and</text>
  <text start="596.09" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s the official number which means</text>
  <text start="598.13" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s probably a lot worse than that and</text>
  <text start="600.41" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="601.97" dur="6.81">I mean what happens when it really does</text>
  <text start="604.04" dur="7.14">get to zero yeah you know thanks to the</text>
  <text start="608.78" dur="5.51">1913 sneaking it in on Christmas for the</text>
  <text start="611.18" dur="5.19">Federal Reserve Act by the way but yeah</text>
  <text start="614.29" dur="3.43">other than that and they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="616.37" dur="2.16">do that again with impeachment I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="617.72" dur="2.75">know if you&amp;#39;ve heard but there&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="620.47" dur="4.51">anyway it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s nonsensical now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="623.75" dur="3.93">sure that you&amp;#39;ve heard about the recent</text>
  <text start="624.98" dur="6.06">bank runs in China what school yes</text>
  <text start="627.68" dur="5.19">well China actually had a policy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.04" dur="3.48">interesting because China really had a</text>
  <text start="632.87" dur="5.52">policy that you just don&amp;#39;t let anybody</text>
  <text start="634.52" dur="6.48">fail so even if a corporation or a bank</text>
  <text start="638.39" dur="5.4">were feeling failing they would just be</text>
  <text start="641" dur="4.83">that failure would be absorbed but</text>
  <text start="643.79" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve shifted and that goes into this</text>
  <text start="645.83" dur="4.59">whole interest rate and that I&amp;#39;m glad</text>
  <text start="648.05" dur="5.39">you brought that up because they have</text>
  <text start="650.42" dur="6.27">decided that maybe they should allow</text>
  <text start="653.44" dur="6.43">corporations and banks to fail and so</text>
  <text start="656.69" dur="5.72">they&amp;#39;ve actually been really voraciously</text>
  <text start="659.87" dur="5.7">setting up their new bankruptcy system</text>
  <text start="662.41" dur="7.39">similar mirrored similar to what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="665.57" dur="6.66">done here here to enable those failures</text>
  <text start="669.8" dur="5.25">but what does that do to the confidence</text>
  <text start="672.23" dur="6.03">of the population when they see these</text>
  <text start="675.05" dur="5.22">bank failures yeah right all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="678.26" dur="3.84">they know it could fail when banks start</text>
  <text start="680.27" dur="2.309">failing it&amp;#39;s like a wake-up call or a</text>
  <text start="682.1" dur="2.159">brush</text>
  <text start="682.579" dur="3.271">fire things suddenly start happening and</text>
  <text start="684.259" dur="4.05">people wake up really quick I can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="4.469">my money out of the ATM oh no it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="688.309" dur="3.69">in certain you know segments of the</text>
  <text start="690.319" dur="5.791">population if food stamps run out for</text>
  <text start="691.999" dur="7.08">three days he will die of rioting yeah</text>
  <text start="696.11" dur="5.159">and these kinds of things I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="699.079" dur="4.23">China is really interesting so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="701.269" dur="4.23">know maybe they do need a tree I mean</text>
  <text start="703.309" dur="4.83">let me ask you a question turn the</text>
  <text start="705.499" dur="5.21">tables a little bit but if they come up</text>
  <text start="708.139" dur="5.521">with and they sign a trade deal a</text>
  <text start="710.709" dur="5.021">preliminary one and they back off the</text>
  <text start="713.66" dur="4.229">tariffs etc I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="715.73" dur="3.839">gonna do that yet or not but let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="717.889" dur="4.98">they do do you think that&amp;#39;s gonna make</text>
  <text start="719.569" dur="5.31">everything all better no no not at all I</text>
  <text start="722.869" dur="3.75">think it&amp;#39;s beyond saving</text>
  <text start="724.879" dur="3.661">you know the economy has to crash I</text>
  <text start="726.619" dur="3.33">think honestly I&amp;#39;m in a sense I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="728.54" dur="3.599">looking forward to it not in the pain</text>
  <text start="729.949" dur="3.901">sense but like the hard lessons learned</text>
  <text start="732.139" dur="4.17">rock-bottom so that we can get beyond</text>
  <text start="733.85" dur="3.51">this system and maybe even in the FATA I</text>
  <text start="736.309" dur="3.45">actually believe we&amp;#39;re gonna go to a</text>
  <text start="737.36" dur="4.649">gold standard next hopefully at some</text>
  <text start="739.759" dur="7.23">point we&amp;#39;re going to have to history</text>
  <text start="742.009" dur="7.221">tell us yeah I mean that every time you</text>
  <text start="746.989" dur="4.741">go through and whether this is</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="4.87">hyperinflationary or hyper deflationary</text>
  <text start="751.73" dur="5.039">doesn&amp;#39;t really matter but every time you</text>
  <text start="754.1" dur="4.889">go through that period of time in order</text>
  <text start="756.769" dur="4.771">for the population to trust the</text>
  <text start="758.989" dur="4.77">government money again they put a</text>
  <text start="761.54" dur="3.81">component of gold in it where at least</text>
  <text start="763.759" dur="4.92">they make it appear like there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="765.35" dur="6.899">component of gold in it and then that</text>
  <text start="768.679" dur="5.76">elicits confidence and a level of</text>
  <text start="772.249" dur="4.861">stability for a while until they start</text>
  <text start="774.439" dur="5.49">to remove it again so yeah I think we</text>
  <text start="777.11" dur="4.829">will see some kind of gold standard even</text>
  <text start="779.929" dur="4.291">if it&amp;#39;s in the SDR which they&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="781.939" dur="5.161">about and why central banks are</text>
  <text start="784.22" dur="5.309">accumulating it like crazy - absolutely</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="4.139">so for me I see it as a rock bottom so</text>
  <text start="789.529" dur="3.96">that we can begin the process of healing</text>
  <text start="791.239" dur="3.991">and get going back to a sane economy</text>
  <text start="793.489" dur="4.08">where people are rewarded for the right</text>
  <text start="795.23" dur="4.589">things and incentive structures fixed so</text>
  <text start="797.569" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s i+ but there is pain to this</text>
  <text start="799.819" dur="4.17">and we will have to go through that</text>
  <text start="800.899" dur="6.9">clearly there&amp;#39;s a tremendous amount of</text>
  <text start="803.989" dur="6.421">pain because most people marry the legal</text>
  <text start="807.799" dur="4.801">money of the state and so they are not</text>
  <text start="810.41" dur="3.81">prepared just like you said if they</text>
  <text start="812.6" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t have food stamps for three days</text>
  <text start="814.22" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s riots</text>
  <text start="816.41" dur="5.28">because you&amp;#39;ve been trained to be just</text>
  <text start="818.57" dur="5.31">in time you know don&amp;#39;t do anything slow</text>
  <text start="821.69" dur="5.85">that takes a lot of effort just spend</text>
  <text start="823.88" dur="5.97">spend spend and so most people only have</text>
  <text start="827.54" dur="4.68">enough food in their pantries for three</text>
  <text start="829.85" dur="3.06">days that&amp;#39;s why I can only last for</text>
  <text start="832.22" dur="2.85">three days</text>
  <text start="832.91" dur="6.18">maybe the grocery stores have something</text>
  <text start="835.07" dur="7.71">a holding warehouse for enough for three</text>
  <text start="839.09" dur="7.86">days but what happens after six days so</text>
  <text start="842.78" dur="8.58">as much pain as there is and you know my</text>
  <text start="846.95" dur="6.78">mantra food water energy security</text>
  <text start="851.36" dur="5.64">community barter ability wealth</text>
  <text start="853.73" dur="6">preservation gold and silver fill those</text>
  <text start="857" dur="5.64">last two our durability and wealth</text>
  <text start="859.73" dur="5.52">preservation but when do you want to</text>
  <text start="862.64" dur="5.33">prepare for this you know the sooner you</text>
  <text start="865.25" dur="6">start the better off you&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="867.97" dur="6.85">sure and let&amp;#39;s play the devil&amp;#39;s advocate</text>
  <text start="871.25" dur="7.23">yeah go ahead let&amp;#39;s just say that by</text>
  <text start="874.82" dur="7.8">some miracle I mean cuz frankly nobody</text>
  <text start="878.48" dur="5.49">really saw QE coming so maybe they come</text>
  <text start="882.62" dur="4.41">up with something else</text>
  <text start="883.97" dur="5.31">and let&amp;#39;s say they prolong this a little</text>
  <text start="887.03" dur="4.05">bit longer I do not think they can but</text>
  <text start="889.28" dur="4.95">let&amp;#39;s just let&amp;#39;s make that assumption</text>
  <text start="891.08" dur="5.88">for a second well how awful would it be</text>
  <text start="894.23" dur="5.73">if you were able to cover your food your</text>
  <text start="896.96" dur="4.8">water your energy your security your</text>
  <text start="899.96" dur="5.04">barter ability and your wealth</text>
  <text start="901.76" dur="6.51">preservation so these are things the</text>
  <text start="905" dur="6.78">point is that and community these are</text>
  <text start="908.27" dur="7.53">things that we always need in order to</text>
  <text start="911.78" dur="8.07">be as secure as possible and maintain</text>
  <text start="915.8" dur="6.3">our own standard of living agreed and</text>
  <text start="919.85" dur="4.38">you know you can live comfortably and</text>
  <text start="922.1" dur="3.72">securely and you know know that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="924.23" dur="4.53">taken care of and you&amp;#39;re stable in a</text>
  <text start="925.82" dur="4.5">hard unstable time or you can you know</text>
  <text start="928.76" dur="4.11">be like everyone else and just suffer</text>
  <text start="930.32" dur="5.88">through it and let you know best case</text>
  <text start="932.87" dur="4.53">whatever happens randomly and I want to</text>
  <text start="936.2" dur="2.55">encourage people if you&amp;#39;re listening to</text>
  <text start="937.4" dur="3.78">this if you&amp;#39;re listening to either of us</text>
  <text start="938.75" dur="4.05">or platforms or anything else you know</text>
  <text start="941.18" dur="4.12">what&amp;#39;s coming I mean you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="942.8" dur="4">informed do something about it you know</text>
  <text start="945.3" dur="3.3">Lynnette or get with somebody that can</text>
  <text start="946.8" dur="3.63">help you you know an expert that can</text>
  <text start="948.6" dur="4.08">help you navigate that and to prepare</text>
  <text start="950.43" dur="3.719">for it and you get you guys to kind of</text>
  <text start="952.68" dur="3.63">plug for you real fast because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="954.149" dur="3.601">do that enough you know you you help</text>
  <text start="956.31" dur="3.3">people with this in terms of getting</text>
  <text start="957.75" dur="3.66">their finances was ready and and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="959.61" dur="5.969">pretty full service at ITM trading right</text>
  <text start="961.41" dur="7.77">oh we we are and we are service oriented</text>
  <text start="965.579" dur="5.221">we like that human contact and you know</text>
  <text start="969.18" dur="3.42">you should understand I&amp;#39;ve been studying</text>
  <text start="970.8" dur="5.039">currency life so I&amp;#39;ve been in these</text>
  <text start="972.6" dur="6.84">markets on some level since 64 but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="975.839" dur="6.451">been studying currencies since 1987 and</text>
  <text start="979.44" dur="5.85">when something happens the same way</text>
  <text start="982.29" dur="5.85">every time you can kind of assume it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.29" dur="5.22">gonna happen like that again but that</text>
  <text start="988.14" dur="5.79">also means that there are things that</text>
  <text start="990.51" dur="5.579">you can do to prepare for it not just to</text>
  <text start="993.93" dur="5.52">get through it which is definitely part</text>
  <text start="996.089" dur="6">of it but also to have the wealth shift</text>
  <text start="999.45" dur="5.129">your way because it really is this whole</text>
  <text start="1002.089" dur="5.94">transition this whole inflation the fiat</text>
  <text start="1004.579" dur="6.301">money system really is about wealth</text>
  <text start="1008.029" dur="6.481">transfer and sometimes they want to do</text>
  <text start="1010.88" dur="5.97">it slowly like 2% inflation a year you</text>
  <text start="1014.51" dur="6">know you don&amp;#39;t necessarily notice that</text>
  <text start="1016.85" dur="6.479">but you&amp;#39;re losing that value every year</text>
  <text start="1020.51" dur="3.569">and then sometimes they need to do it</text>
  <text start="1023.329" dur="3.301">quickly</text>
  <text start="1024.079" dur="4.98">so that they can push other agendas</text>
  <text start="1026.63" dur="4.829">never let a good crisis go to waste</text>
  <text start="1029.059" dur="4.411">yeah part of the playbook of those in</text>
  <text start="1031.459" dur="3.75">power forward so we&amp;#39;ve covered you know</text>
  <text start="1033.47" dur="3.479">the debt crisis we&amp;#39;ve we talked about</text>
  <text start="1035.209" dur="3.151">interest rates and we&amp;#39;ve talked about a</text>
  <text start="1036.949" dur="3.331">little bit of the trade and what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1038.36" dur="4.41">on in China and the banks and and the</text>
  <text start="1040.28" dur="3.51">crisis that&amp;#39;s afflicting the banks and</text>
  <text start="1042.77" dur="2.64">we missed anything that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1043.79" dur="3.93">important to your mind in terms of</text>
  <text start="1045.41" dur="6.12">getting the big picture right now for</text>
  <text start="1047.72" dur="6.78">folks well we&amp;#39;ve got you know I would</text>
  <text start="1051.53" dur="5.399">say that really populism is growing and</text>
  <text start="1054.5" dur="5.97">you know I think that the elites are</text>
  <text start="1056.929" dur="5.191">very worried about their loss of control</text>
  <text start="1060.47" dur="3.54">you can look at Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="1062.12" dur="3.66">you can you can look at a number of</text>
  <text start="1064.01" dur="5.49">places around the world that are really</text>
  <text start="1065.78" dur="5.79">suffering right now but populism is</text>
  <text start="1069.5" dur="5.309">growing and it seems like they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1071.57" dur="5.64">backing down and that means that the</text>
  <text start="1074.809" dur="4.291">confidence in the traditional and</text>
  <text start="1077.21" dur="5.25">standard institutions</text>
  <text start="1079.1" dur="9.079">is also failing and you know if the</text>
  <text start="1082.46" dur="8.67">central banks cannot generate I mean</text>
  <text start="1088.179" dur="5.71">taking on debt can only make it seem</text>
  <text start="1091.13" dur="5.34">like you have economic growth if they</text>
  <text start="1093.889" dur="5.16">cannot make it seem like the economy is</text>
  <text start="1096.47" dur="5.61">growing because because they&amp;#39;ve used up</text>
  <text start="1099.049" dur="6.12">all their tools then that means that the</text>
  <text start="1102.08" dur="5.55">confidence in the central banks I mean</text>
  <text start="1105.169" dur="7.291">it is in jeopardy it is hugely in</text>
  <text start="1107.63" dur="7.049">jeopardy and they know it I am sorry I</text>
  <text start="1112.46" dur="4.439">was muted yeah I agree in paper-money</text>
  <text start="1114.679" dur="4.291">it&amp;#39;s really just confidence it&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="1116.899" dur="3.961">is a confidence game it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s worth the</text>
  <text start="1118.97" dur="3.87">toilet paper but people believe it has</text>
  <text start="1120.86" dur="3.539">some sort of a new intrinsic do it</text>
  <text start="1122.84" dur="3.99">because of the confidence in the</text>
  <text start="1124.399" dur="6.24">government behind it and that&amp;#39;s great it</text>
  <text start="1126.83" dur="5.79">vanishes very quickly and that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="1130.639" dur="5.49">gold comes in because gold is the</text>
  <text start="1132.62" dur="5.37">savings based money yeah no one&amp;#39;s ever</text>
  <text start="1136.129" dur="4.471">wake up saying oh that&amp;#39;s not worth</text>
  <text start="1137.99" dur="4.529">anything today well that&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="1140.6" dur="4.079">happened because it&amp;#39;s used across the</text>
  <text start="1142.519" dur="4.74">entire global economy so there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="1144.679" dur="5.46">demand for it there&amp;#39;s not always demand</text>
  <text start="1147.259" dur="5.491">for dollars yeah you know or euros or</text>
  <text start="1150.139" dur="3.961">you want or whatever I do like to make</text>
  <text start="1152.75" dur="3.09">the point because it&amp;#39;s a really strong</text>
  <text start="1154.1" dur="2.819">point well why you mentioned that that</text>
  <text start="1155.84" dur="2.91">the trend</text>
  <text start="1156.919" dur="3.63">once again the trend for other central</text>
  <text start="1158.75" dur="4.039">banks and other governments holding</text>
  <text start="1160.549" dur="5.161">dollars in reserve it&amp;#39;s going down as a</text>
  <text start="1162.789" dur="4.63">band need they&amp;#39;re jumping ship they hate</text>
  <text start="1165.71" dur="3.15">America they hate the way that we&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1168.86" dur="3.33">under other presidents and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1170.69" dur="5.099">basically at this point tired of the</text>
  <text start="1172.19" dur="5.64">dollar control system so a new system is</text>
  <text start="1175.789" dur="3.75">emerging whether we like it or not and</text>
  <text start="1177.83" dur="4.26">that system is not going to be a dollar</text>
  <text start="1179.539" dur="6.27">based system eventually I&amp;#39;m fair to say</text>
  <text start="1182.09" dur="5.219">I think that&amp;#39;s very fair to say and and</text>
  <text start="1185.809" dur="4.561">you know there have been so many other</text>
  <text start="1187.309" dur="6.09">currencies that have been the world</text>
  <text start="1190.37" dur="4.83">reserve currency in the past meaning</text>
  <text start="1193.399" dur="3.63">because not everybody understands that</text>
  <text start="1195.2" dur="4.05">but meaning if you&amp;#39;re going outside of</text>
  <text start="1197.029" dur="3.99">your borders to buy anything whether</text>
  <text start="1199.25" dur="4.139">you&amp;#39;re a government or corporation it&amp;#39;s</text>
