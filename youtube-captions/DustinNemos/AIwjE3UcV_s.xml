  <text start="555.6" dur="3.09">actually and this you guys are may</text>
  <text start="557.31" dur="2.97">remember at one point during the Obama</text>
  <text start="558.69" dur="3.42">administration there was this idea</text>
  <text start="560.28" dur="3.63">floated that they could just seize the</text>
  <text start="562.11" dur="3.78">the state&amp;#39;s election systems and take</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="4.08">them over well maybe they&amp;#39;re gonna use</text>
  <text start="565.89" dur="3.72">that against them now so Secretary of</text>
  <text start="567.99" dur="4.17">the Department of Homeland Security DHS</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="4.98">John Kelly recently affirmed his support</text>
  <text start="572.16" dur="3.45">for an Obama era policy I love how they</text>
  <text start="574.59" dur="2.61">keep using that against them because</text>
  <text start="575.61" dur="3.87">what can they say it&amp;#39;s their hero Obama</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="4.23">which designated the state election</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="4.35">apparatus s critical infrastructure and</text>
  <text start="581.43" dur="3.78">thus in some vague sense under federal</text>
  <text start="583.83" dur="6.15">control all right</text>
  <text start="585.21" dur="7.11">so in 2017 then secretary jeh RJ I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="589.98" dur="4.17">have to say jeh jeh Johnson clear and I</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="3.72">messed up the other day I said simpler</text>
  <text start="594.15" dur="3.93">fee instead of simplifying apologies</text>
  <text start="596.04" dur="4.29">obviously I&amp;#39;ve spent a long time since I</text>
  <text start="598.08" dur="4.8">wasn&amp;#39;t even in ROTC so give me a break</text>
  <text start="600.33" dur="4.47">there then secretary jeh Johnson</text>
  <text start="602.88" dur="4.14">clarified and otherwise defended the</text>
  <text start="604.8" dur="4.65">federal government&amp;#39;s position that by</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="3.96">election infrastructure we mean storage</text>
  <text start="609.45" dur="3.45">facilities polling places and</text>
  <text start="610.98" dur="3.92">centralized vote tabulation locations</text>
  <text start="612.9" dur="5.49">used to support the election process</text>
  <text start="614.9" dur="5.53">boom all right so this is one option on</text>
  <text start="618.39" dur="4.35">the table and we have the support of</text>
  <text start="620.43" dur="5.55">John Kelly and for those who are curious</text>
  <text start="622.74" dur="5.04">I was an officer in the Air Force ROTC</text>
  <text start="625.98" dur="3.03">system in high school so if I had gone</text>
  <text start="627.78" dur="3.72">to the military I could actually been an</text>
  <text start="629.01" dur="3.96">officer I guess you get bumped up a</text>
  <text start="631.5" dur="4.02">couple notches when you when you had</text>
  <text start="632.97" dur="4.38">ROTC training but I was I was like</text>
  <text start="635.52" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re so goofy I was the flight</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="4.32">commander of my class and I had to I had</text>
  <text start="639.63" dur="3.87">to do all the UM</text>
  <text start="641.67" dur="4.26">direct that marches I was on the drill</text>
  <text start="643.5" dur="6.48">team is all event craziness</text>
  <text start="645.93" dur="6.03">anyway so I want you guys to read this</text>
  <text start="649.98" dur="4.38">with me as well let me make sure it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="651.96" dur="6.24">the screen and centered a little bit off</text>
  <text start="654.36" dur="5.73">okay so this is on vote which is kind of</text>
  <text start="658.2" dur="3.93">since they banned the read at page this</text>
  <text start="660.09" dur="4.02">is where people are going to discuss the</text>
  <text start="662.13" dur="3.27">Q that&amp;#39;s not on the chance itself it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="664.11" dur="2.76">little bit easier to read through and</text>
  <text start="665.4" dur="4.679">more</text>
  <text start="666.87" dur="5.37">and even then there&amp;#39;s still some fear of</text>
  <text start="670.079" dur="4.5">censorship but vote is also where all</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="3.51">the pizza gate investigations ended up</text>
  <text start="674.579" dur="3.06">being because they were banned</text>
  <text start="675.75" dur="3.24">everywhere else I mean these people ban</text>
  <text start="677.639" dur="3.69">everything because they can&amp;#39;t argue with</text>
  <text start="678.99" dur="3.659">it and they are definitely afraid of it</text>
  <text start="681.329" dur="3">getting out</text>
  <text start="682.649" dur="3.091">the only reason to ban anything if it</text>
  <text start="684.329" dur="2.88">was actually fake you would just point</text>
  <text start="685.74" dur="3.719">out how it&amp;#39;s fake and laugh at it right</text>
  <text start="687.209" dur="4.531">that&amp;#39;s the most powerful way to debunk</text>
  <text start="689.459" dur="4.261">fake things is ridicule not censorship</text>
  <text start="691.74" dur="3.149">when you get censored you start</text>
  <text start="693.72" dur="6.179">censoring you get there the strike zone</text>
  <text start="694.889" dur="9.2">effect you make it more powerful okay so</text>
  <text start="699.899" dur="6.481">the Federal Register gov and a bunch of</text>
  <text start="704.089" dur="3.61">numbers and such and then imposing</text>
  <text start="706.38" dur="3">certain sanctions in the event of</text>
  <text start="707.699" dur="3.991">foreign interference in a United States</text>

  <text start="770.459" dur="3.841">have a definition of what foreign</text>
  <text start="771.6" dur="4.799">interference is but basically the idea</text>
  <text start="774.3" dur="3.599">is that because they&amp;#39;ve been playing</text>

  <text start="794.339" dur="3.091">the idea the pretext that is foreign</text>
  <text start="795.959" dur="2.671">governments but what we&amp;#39;ll find is that</text>
  <text start="797.43" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s the Democrats</text>
  <text start="798.63" dur="6.44">they really have been shooting</text>
  <text start="801.6" dur="7.8">themselves in the foot so to speak now</text>
  <text start="805.07" dur="5.62">you guys know that oh let me give you a</text>

  <text start="825.87" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s bashing nationalism although France</text>
  <text start="827.73" dur="4.28">is one the most nationalist countries</text>

  <text start="840.75" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;s a complete hypocrite but anyway I</text>
  <text start="843.54" dur="4.41">want to go through with you guys</text>
  <text start="845.4" dur="4.74">the recent a serial brain - post okay so</text>
  <text start="847.95" dur="4.29">brain - is awesome I actually believe</text>
  <text start="850.14" dur="3.84">he&amp;#39;s not if he&amp;#39;s not part of the team</text>
  <text start="852.24" dur="4.56">queue he&amp;#39;s got some kind of insider</text>
  <text start="853.98" dur="5.37">information that or he&amp;#39;s an IQ like 160</text>
  <text start="856.8" dur="5.67">170 I can&amp;#39;t keep up with him and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="859.35" dur="4.44">a dumb guy so let&amp;#39;s go through what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="862.47" dur="4.17">talking about I&amp;#39;m gonna just read</text>
  <text start="863.79" dur="4.71">through his analysis of things but this</text>
  <text start="866.64" dur="4.38">is why I was confident even though</text>
  <text start="868.5" dur="5.01">sessions stepped down and like a many of</text>
  <text start="871.02" dur="4.71">the people in queue had this like shock</text>
  <text start="873.51" dur="4.83">or blow of confidence to them you know</text>
  <text start="875.73" dur="4.71">remember it was us that put the the</text>
  <text start="878.34" dur="4.2">assumption out there and we we believed</text>
  <text start="880.44" dur="3.66">that sessions himself would be the</text>
  <text start="882.54" dur="3.69">silent executioner he would be the</text>
  <text start="884.1" dur="4.53">hammer he would be the stealth bomber</text>
  <text start="886.23" dur="3.87">but that was never something that Q told</text>
  <text start="888.63" dur="3.06">us he told us to trust sessions and</text>
  <text start="890.1" dur="6">sessions did his job behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="891.69" dur="7.74">his job was basically to placate the the</text>
  <text start="896.1" dur="4.77">enemy make them kind of go to sleep</text>
  <text start="899.43" dur="2.97">because look he&amp;#39;s not he said he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="900.87" dur="4.29">do-nothing AG we have so we have</text>
  <text start="902.4" dur="4.71">Rosenstein we&amp;#39;re gonna get our way and</text>
  <text start="905.16" dur="3.87">that was what he did when he he recused</text>
  <text start="907.11" dur="3.42">himself but all along he was setting up</text>
  <text start="909.03" dur="5.37">the investigations behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="910.53" dur="5.76">with Huber and Horowitz so when the time</text>
  <text start="914.4" dur="4.17">was right they can bring out someone</text>
  <text start="916.29" dur="3.51">else okay so let&amp;#39;s go through what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.57" dur="4.26">talking about this and he&amp;#39;s gonna use</text>
  <text start="919.8" dur="5.97">some some metaphors how does the Eagle</text>
  <text start="922.83" dur="4.41">defeat the goat I&amp;#39;ve never even heard of</text>
  <text start="925.77" dur="3.45">that kind of thing but it makes absolute</text>
  <text start="927.24" dur="3.96">sense after reading this thing which I</text>
  <text start="929.22" dur="2.94">did read this one before I got to you</text>
  <text start="931.2" dur="2.73">guys but</text>
  <text start="932.16" dur="3.659">that&amp;#39;s I just knew I had to read it for</text>
  <text start="933.93" dur="4.29">everybody</text>
  <text start="935.819" dur="4.5">as you can see he&amp;#39;s got some example</text>
  <text start="938.22" dur="4.14">videos the Eagle takes the goat from the</text>
  <text start="940.319" dur="3.811">top of the mountain flies with it until</text>
  <text start="942.36" dur="3.75">the altitude is high enough for the goat</text>
  <text start="944.13" dur="5.399">to not survive if it falls and then lets</text>
  <text start="946.11" dur="5.01">it go analysis the strategy behind the</text>
  <text start="949.529" dur="3.091">eagle&amp;#39;s attack is brilliant the eagle</text>
  <text start="951.12" dur="3.12">knows if he attacks the goat and keeps</text>
  <text start="952.62" dur="3.23">the fight at the ground level the goat</text>
  <text start="954.24" dur="3.959">would surpass it in weight and strength</text>
  <text start="955.85" dur="4.03">instead the Eagle smartly invites the</text>
  <text start="958.199" dur="3.63">goat to deal with the law of gravity and</text>
  <text start="959.88" dur="4.139">transforms the goats weight and strength</text>
  <text start="961.829" dur="4.051">into a fatal liability this is a martial</text>
  <text start="964.019" dur="4.771">arts principle using their strength</text>
  <text start="965.88" dur="4.709">against them application what if you</text>
  <text start="968.79" dur="3.18">know the DIMMs have been committing</text>
  <text start="970.589" dur="3.3">voter fraud for decades to still</text>
  <text start="971.97" dur="2.52">elections and you want to stop it once</text>
  <text start="973.889" dur="3.63">and for all</text>
  <text start="974.49" dur="4.86">oh and by the way remember recently now</text>
  <text start="977.519" dur="3.721">we&amp;#39;ve gotten out of that agreement that</text>
  <text start="979.35" dur="3.599">accord with the the democrats where</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="4.62">republicans couldn&amp;#39;t even challenge</text>
  <text start="982.949" dur="4.89">elections okay that&amp;#39;s now done too so we</text>
  <text start="985.86" dur="5.459">can actually do that again people didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="987.839" dur="4.68">even know about that right okay so how</text>
  <text start="991.319" dur="3.121">do you stop it once and for all</text>
  <text start="992.519" dur="3.81">you let the goat climb the mountain as</text>
  <text start="994.44" dur="4.709">you&amp;#39;re allowing the elections then you</text>
  <text start="996.329" dur="4.801">pick it and fly with it until the</text>
  <text start="999.149" dur="3.781">altitude is high enough gathering</text>
  <text start="1001.13" dur="3.959">evidence and then you let it deal with</text>
  <text start="1002.93" dur="4.32">the law of gravity enforcing the law as</text>
  <text start="1005.089" dur="3.6">you can see there are legal voters and</text>
  <text start="1007.25" dur="3.589">fraudulent activities they thought were</text>
  <text start="1008.689" dur="4.441">their strength become a fatal liability</text>
  <text start="1010.839" dur="7.091">excuse me when their party will have to</text>
  <text start="1013.13" dur="7.649">deal with the long queue 2479 what if</text>
  <text start="1017.93" dur="4.8">the below could be proven one election</text>
  <text start="1020.779" dur="4.861">plus democrat party officials filled out</text>
  <text start="1022.73" dur="4.5">many thousands of blank ballots too they</text>
  <text start="1025.64" dur="3.84">removed and destroyed legal ballots</text>
  <text start="1027.23" dur="4.92">three deliberately organized non citizen</text>
  <text start="1029.48" dur="5.25">voting and four party officials in</text>
  <text start="1032.15" dur="4.439">multiple locations across the u.s. under</text>
  <text start="1034.73" dur="3.27">lock and key store many thousands of</text>
  <text start="1036.589" dur="4.11">blank ballots for the purposes of</text>
  <text start="1038" dur="5.789">altering the vote total this is why</text>
  <text start="1040.699" dur="5.85">you&amp;#39;re seeing 90% of these things being</text>
  <text start="1043.789" dur="4.471">roughly 90 percent of these found votes</text>
  <text start="1046.549" dur="4.411">which are only happening in Democrat</text>
  <text start="1048.26" dur="5.61">controlled areas there they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="1050.96" dur="5.099">out 90% in favor of the Dems even though</text>
  <text start="1053.87" dur="6.689">the actual average voting in that area</text>
  <text start="1056.059" dur="8.241">was like 50 40 or 50 50 or 60 40 or even</text>
  <text start="1060.559" dur="6.201">70/30 kind of breakdowns</text>
  <text start="1064.3" dur="4.08">another interesting thing to notice is</text>
  <text start="1066.76" dur="3.99">if the goat had not climbed the mountain</text>
  <text start="1068.38" dur="4.2">it would probably have been safer as you</text>
  <text start="1070.75" dur="3.42">can see Mother Nature herself recommends</text>
  <text start="1072.58" dur="3.54">goats should remain in low altitudes</text>
  <text start="1074.17" dur="4.98">with translates to them should never be</text>
  <text start="1076.12" dur="5.4">in charge the critical element that</text>
  <text start="1079.15" dur="3.75">makes the Eagles strategy work and I</text>
  <text start="1081.52" dur="4.26">need to move it over a little bit I</text>
  <text start="1082.9" dur="3.21">apologize it&amp;#39;s hard to fit it all on</text>
  <text start="1085.78" dur="3.26">there</text>
  <text start="1086.11" dur="6">let me move make my camera smaller too</text>
  <text start="1089.04" dur="4.69">okay the critical element that makes the</text>
