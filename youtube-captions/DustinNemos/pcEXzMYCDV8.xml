  <text start="121.2" dur="5.699">here we go smoking gun shocking FOIA</text>
  <text start="124.439" dur="4.561">document shows that the FBI agreed to</text>
  <text start="126.899" dur="5.941">copper up and ignore all Hillary crimes</text>
  <text start="129" dur="6.36">in its 2016 investigation Wow</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="3.96">so a recent FOIA request by attorney ty</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="4.79">Clevenger</text>
  <text start="136.8" dur="7.89">and a lot of new unredacted information</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="7.66">now this is scary stuff that the FBI</text>
  <text start="144.69" dur="5.46">would go through so many hoops to and</text>
  <text start="147.81" dur="4.95">and and just work for if not with the</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="5.91">Clintons to just cover everything up as</text>
  <text start="152.76" dur="5.55">though it was just they were serving</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="4.32">them to help them cover the evidence</text>
  <text start="158.31" dur="3.69">really that&amp;#39;s the only reason they do</text>
  <text start="160.38" dur="4.32">these investigations is to find the</text>
  <text start="162" dur="5.58">evidence to destroy it that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="4.86">seems like so we have one quote last</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="4.32">August FBI officials paid a visit to</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="4.29">Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s office in Washington</text>
  <text start="171.9" dur="4.14">and begged to see six laptop computers</text>
  <text start="173.85" dur="4.08">containing the former Secretary of</text>
  <text start="176.04" dur="4.22">State&amp;#39;s classified emails and they were</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="5.31">told to take a hike and they did</text>
  <text start="180.26" dur="5.2">Clinton&amp;#39;s lawyers declined to provide</text>
  <text start="183.24" dur="3.06">consent for the bureau to even search</text>
  <text start="185.46" dur="3.18">the laptops</text>
  <text start="186.3" dur="4.13">let alone seize them claiming they may</text>
  <text start="188.64" dur="4.05">contain privileged communications</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="4.33">instead of seeking to subpoena the</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="5.22">evidence the FBI meekly wished to</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="5.49">arrange for secure storage of them in a</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="4.08">manner agreeable to both the FBI and the</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="3.84">attorneys even though the attorneys</text>
  <text start="201.99" dur="3.93">lacked authorization to handle the</text>
  <text start="204.09" dur="4.95">material which included top-secret</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="5.49">information through documents received</text>
  <text start="209.04" dur="4.74">from a FOIA filing we now have support</text>

  <text start="291.21" dur="5.76">limited the search parameters two months</text>
  <text start="293.61" dur="5.22">not years the FBI could only search for</text>

  <text start="303.9" dur="5.04">Mills were permitted to be searched this</text>
  <text start="305.88" dur="4.62">ensured that no one no emails covering</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="4.62">the destruction of evidence was even</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="4.949">permitted to be examined the FBI agreed</text>
  <text start="313.56" dur="4.109">to perform an investigation where they</text>
  <text start="315.449" dur="5.851">were not even allowed to look at the</text>
  <text start="317.669" dur="5.941">evidence next while still being under a</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.56">preservation order Clinton just</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="4.47">arbitrarily decided to change email</text>
  <text start="325.86" dur="5.279">retention policies and delete all emails</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="5.869">older than 60 days which amounted to all</text>
  <text start="331.139" dur="7.77">emails from January 2009 through October</text>
  <text start="333.949" dur="6.46">2014 the FBI agreed to not examine any</text>
  <text start="338.909" dur="3.48">evidence surrounding the bleached bit</text>
  <text start="340.409" dur="5.13">event despite the fact that they knew</text>
  <text start="342.389" dur="5.221">about it before even agreeing to this on</text>
  <text start="345.539" dur="3.66">top of that the FBI agreed to delete any</text>
  <text start="347.61" dur="4.86">evidence that they encountered that was</text>
  <text start="349.199" dur="5.28">outside degreed parameters and then of</text>
  <text start="352.47" dur="6.33">course they agreed to destroy the</text>
  <text start="354.479" dur="6.241">laptops in addition if the headers for</text>
  <text start="358.8" dur="4.26">the blackberry emails were missing a</text>
  <text start="360.72" dur="5.1">date those emails were excluded from the</text>
  <text start="363.06" dur="4.68">investigation as well the FBI also</text>
  <text start="365.82" dur="5.45">agreed to circumvent future FOIA</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="6.209">requests which is probably a you know</text>
  <text start="371.27" dur="5.17">circumvention of the rule of law I would</text>
  <text start="373.949" dur="4.381">agree and then on top of all of this</text>
  <text start="376.44" dur="4.5">immunity agreements were given out like</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="5.399">candy to anyone connected with Hillary -</text>
  <text start="380.94" dur="6.18">for Bryan Pagliano one for Paul comdata</text>

  <text start="387.12" dur="8.99">and one for her Heather Samuelson so</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="8.94">this is getting pretty crazy isn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="396.11" dur="7.299">now this letter to Lynch the date of the</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="7.56">wilkinson immunity agreement is June</text>
  <text start="403.409" dur="8.25">10 2016 it gets crazier what happens to</text>
  <text start="409.11" dur="4.199">be the exact same day that call me</text>
  <text start="411.659" dur="4.41">changed the wording in his Hillary email</text>
  <text start="413.309" dur="6.271">exoneration letter from gross negligence</text>
  <text start="416.069" dur="5.34">to extremely careless this also happens</text>
  <text start="419.58" dur="3.509">to be the day that all DNC employees</text>
  <text start="421.409" dur="3.87">were told to leave their laptops in the</text>
  <text start="423.089" dur="6.33">office so CrowdStrike could update their</text>
  <text start="425.279" dur="6.54">software this no doubt was a ruse for</text>
  <text start="429.419" dur="4.441">CrowdStrike to eliminate any emails left</text>
  <text start="431.819" dur="5.58">on their systems related to crooked</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="8.039">Hillary Obama&amp;#39;s DOJ and FBI were the</text>
  <text start="437.399" dur="8.76">most corrupt entities in US history that</text>
  <text start="441.899" dur="6.12">is wild and beyond that we also have and</text>
  <text start="446.159" dur="4.5">you know before we move on let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="448.019" dur="5.19">clear we are moving into the Justice</text>
  <text start="450.659" dur="3.84">face these things are coming out now but</text>
  <text start="453.209" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s a little bit different this time</text>
  <text start="454.499" dur="5.01">yes they&amp;#39;re covering up evidence that</text>
  <text start="456.869" dur="5.28">yes they&amp;#39;re deleting things but we have</text>
  <text start="459.509" dur="6.21">somebody who&amp;#39;s a good guy truther in</text>
  <text start="462.149" dur="5.16">office and our president has set things</text>
  <text start="465.719" dur="5.37">in motion to make sure these guys go</text>
  <text start="467.309" dur="5.4">down now Epstein&amp;#39;s madam oh that&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="471.089" dur="4.08">good word for her found</text>
  <text start="472.709" dur="4.71">Ghislaine Knoxville living with tech CEO</text>
  <text start="475.169" dur="4.35">and multi-million dollar oceanfront</text>
  <text start="477.419" dur="3.631">mansion and basically the gist of the</text>
  <text start="479.519" dur="3.721">article is that she&amp;#39;s been hiding out</text>
  <text start="481.05" dur="4.229">completely opposite of her usual</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="4.319">lifestyle of partying and going around</text>
  <text start="485.279" dur="4.461">the world and stuff quote she&amp;#39;s become a</text>
  <text start="487.559" dur="6.51">real homebody rarely ventures out</text>
  <text start="489.74" dur="6.279">alright so this is not someone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="494.069" dur="3.75">following her typical lifestyle she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.019" dur="5.64">laying low she&amp;#39;s hiding</text>
  <text start="497.819" dur="6.69">she knows she&amp;#39;s in trouble we also have</text>
  <text start="501.659" dur="5.76">autopsy findings broken bones and</text>
  <text start="504.509" dur="5.28">Epstein&amp;#39;s neck death associated more</text>
  <text start="507.419" dur="5.25">with a homicidal strangulation rather</text>
  <text start="509.789" dur="5.071">than a suicide now maybe if you fell off</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="4.17">a tree and you&amp;#39;re being hung by the neck</text>
  <text start="514.86" dur="4.619">as a traitor which hey that could happen</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="4.74">in the future for some folks you might</text>
  <text start="519.479" dur="3.511">expect some broken bones in the neck and</text>
  <text start="521.579" dur="4.891">maybe even hope for it because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.99" dur="7.319">the quick way to go right well this is</text>
  <text start="526.47" dur="7.26">not that this guy six-foot-tall his map</text>
  <text start="530.309" dur="5.97">hit his bed if he&amp;#39;s lucky was probably</text>
  <text start="533.73" dur="3.09">six feet tall if he had put it over on</text>
  <text start="536.279" dur="3.421">the</text>
  <text start="536.82" dur="6.81">and used it to somehow leverage himself</text>
  <text start="539.7" dur="6.93">up he would have had to still pull in</text>
  <text start="543.63" dur="4.74">his feet to actually suicide this way he</text>
  <text start="546.63" dur="7.59">would not have had the momentum to break</text>
  <text start="548.37" dur="7.44">anything this is interesting now we also</text>
  <text start="554.22" dur="3.03">have maybe it&amp;#39;s part of Bill Boras</text>
  <text start="555.81" dur="4.56">investigation already coming out right</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="6.99">we also have NYPD cop committing suicide</text>
  <text start="560.37" dur="6.15">ninth this year second NYPD suicide this</text>
  <text start="564.24" dur="4.71">week I wonder what the normal is for a</text>
  <text start="566.52" dur="4.35">year for NYPD committing suicide</text>
  <text start="568.95" dur="4.31">I wonder our statistically how much</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="6.83">that&amp;#39;s gone up since the laptop incident</text>
  <text start="573.26" dur="6.4">with Weiner now we also have apparently</text>
  <text start="577.7" dur="4">okay and there there&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="3.6">conjecture here but it seems to be a</text>
  <text start="581.7" dur="3.33">pretty strong argument so far I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="583.26" dur="3.78">had a portrait of Bill Clinton wearing</text>
  <text start="585.03" dur="3.87">Monica Lewinsky &amp;#39;he&amp;#39;s blue dress in the</text>
  <text start="587.04" dur="4.62">Oval Office inside of his Manhattan</text>
  <text start="588.9" dur="4.38">mansion I guess if you&amp;#39;re just a</text>
  <text start="591.66" dur="3.63">billionaire with dirt on everyone this</text>
  <text start="593.28" dur="4.26">is the exact kind of trophy that you</text>
  <text start="595.29" dur="4.44">would take yeah I got a president</text>
  <text start="597.54" dur="3.72">picture and address on my wall right in</text>

  <text start="601.26" dur="8.31">house office oh man it&amp;#39;s just a crazy</text>
  <text start="606.6" dur="5.85">world we live in and isn&amp;#39;t it and then</text>
  <text start="609.57" dur="4.47">continuing on we also have in the</text>
  <text start="612.45" dur="5.31">incident with the Google Insider who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="614.04" dur="5.94">now come out to uh to sort of reveal the</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="4.41">fact we all knew of course but reveal</text>
  <text start="619.98" dur="5.31">the facts behind what we own their own</text>
  <text start="622.17" dur="5.4">the evidence behind it that Google was</text>
  <text start="625.29" dur="3.36">indeed rigging algorithms against us and</text>
  <text start="627.57" dur="4.11">look what happened to him</text>
  <text start="628.65" dur="5.37">police bomb squad and the FBI surround</text>
  <text start="631.68" dur="4.38">his house or his are I guess his</text>
  <text start="634.02" dur="4.44">apartment why and just because Google</text>
  <text start="636.06" dur="5.13">said he was suicidal</text>
  <text start="638.46" dur="5.31">they turned bomb robots and police dogs</text>
  <text start="641.19" dur="4.32">and guns on this guy who supposedly</text>
  <text start="643.77" dur="4.61">suicidal I mean they&amp;#39;re pointing guns at</text>

  <text start="684.72" dur="4.38">gonna be seen as heroes for this and the</text>
  <text start="686.67" dur="4.62">others are gonna say look I don&amp;#39;t like</text>

  <text start="694.68" dur="4.38">soul right I talked about that yesterday</text>
  <text start="696.6" dur="4.56">so they&amp;#39;re gonna be more out there</text>

  <text start="707.759" dur="3.06">know you lose your paycheck and stuff</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="3.69">maybe they try to scare you with some</text>
  <text start="710.819" dur="4.14">police but otherwise you&amp;#39;re received as</text>
  <text start="712.92" dur="4.2">a hero and maybe you have more</text>
  <text start="714.959" dur="3.63">opportunity than ever but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="717.12" dur="4.199">gonna be for everybody so there&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="718.589" dur="5.49">be a race to the exit now at least</text>
  <text start="721.319" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s my prediction of course you know</text>
  <text start="724.079" dur="3.211">if they do stack the companies with</text>
  <text start="725.399" dur="4.17">leftists also so they won&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="727.29" dur="4.62">completely fall apart yet but it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="729.569" dur="4.921">largely be just you know the the</text>
  <text start="731.91" dur="4.76">evildoers and the left remaining there</text>
  <text start="734.49" dur="7.05">soon as more and more conservatives</text>
  <text start="736.67" dur="6.609">whistle blow now we also have this was</text>
  <text start="741.54" dur="3.45">pretty funny Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s calling on</text>
  <text start="743.279" dur="5.461">Nadler saying listen if you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="744.99" dur="4.26">file impeachment file or shut up sorry</text>
  <text start="748.74" dur="3.329">about that</text>
  <text start="749.25" dur="5.79">computer noises he says file or shut up</text>
  <text start="752.069" dur="4.801">now what does that mean well Nadler is</text>
  <text start="755.04" dur="3.599">trying to get this whole like late in</text>
  <text start="756.87" dur="4.05">late fall and Peach meant like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="758.639" dur="5.55">getting there with a what was the term</text>
  <text start="760.92" dur="5.659">he used a informal impeachment it was an</text>
  <text start="764.189" dur="5.161">informal impeachment on this one so I</text>
  <text start="766.579" dur="6.041">guess that&amp;#39;s just a made-up term to try</text>
  <text start="769.35" dur="6.45">to whip up some hope &amp;#39;i&amp;#39;m for the left</text>
  <text start="772.62" dur="5.13">mob and that&amp;#39;s just not gonna happen so</text>
  <text start="775.8" dur="3.269">gaudi&amp;#39;s calling him out just saying like</text>
  <text start="777.75" dur="2.79">what we&amp;#39;re all thinking here like you</text>
  <text start="779.069" dur="3.661">don&amp;#39;t really actually have a case you</text>
  <text start="780.54" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t have an actual impeachment Goudy</text>
  <text start="782.73" dur="3.9">says the same thing there&amp;#39;s no such</text>
  <text start="784.23" dur="4.68">thing he says i have no idea what that</text>
  <text start="786.63" dur="5.67">means I mean what is informal</text>
  <text start="788.91" dur="5.25">impeachment so that&amp;#39;s just a matter of</text>
  <text start="792.3" dur="4.589">time as well I mean matter is on the way</text>
  <text start="794.16" dur="5.6">out and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s very stressed I think</text>
  <text start="796.889" dur="4.851">and you can tell by the way he he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="799.76" dur="4.56">problems you know he gets flustered he</text>
  <text start="801.74" dur="4.5">gets he he doesn&amp;#39;t keep track of the</text>
  <text start="804.32" dur="3.9">wording I mean he tries to insert a</text>
  <text start="806.24" dur="3.21">narrative on Candace oh and she passes</text>
  <text start="808.22" dur="4.14">out</text>
  <text start="809.45" dur="4.47">you know mid mid things so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="812.36" dur="3.03">interesting to see what neither is doing</text>
  <text start="813.92" dur="3.71">here I think he may be one of the guilty</text>
  <text start="815.39" dur="5.07">ones if he&amp;#39;s if he&amp;#39;s fighting so hard</text>
  <text start="817.63" dur="4.87">now this this is not gonna be the</text>
  <text start="820.46" dur="4.17">biggest headline of the day but maybe it</text>
  <text start="822.5" dur="4.59">should be Democratic senators are</text>
  <text start="824.63" dur="6.15">threatening Supreme Court saying he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="827.09" dur="6.12">or face drastic restructuring my gosh</text>
  <text start="830.78" dur="4.17">this is frightening not only do they</text>
  <text start="833.21" dur="3.3">have this thing already stacked with</text>
  <text start="834.95" dur="4.41">many leftist crazies like the Elena</text>
  <text start="836.51" dur="4.74">Kagan all right and maybe rvg who</text>
  <text start="839.36" dur="5.04">probably isn&amp;#39;t even alive anymore</text>
  <text start="841.25" dur="4.92">I mean all the video evidence supposedly</text>
  <text start="844.4" dur="5.61">coming out of her being alive just seems</text>
  <text start="846.17" dur="7.41">to be completely fake and easily shown</text>
  <text start="850.01" dur="6.66">to be false but not only that but as</text>
  <text start="853.58" dur="5.28">soon as we get a conservative suppose it</text>
  <text start="856.67" dur="4.62">majority in there and not really yet not</text>
  <text start="858.86" dur="4.23">really but soon as we get Kavanagh in</text>
  <text start="861.29" dur="3.21">there supposedly they are feeling some</text>
  <text start="863.09" dur="3.09">fear now they&amp;#39;re threatening the supreme</text>
  <text start="864.5" dur="4.14">court they&amp;#39;re basically trying to stack</text>
  <text start="866.18" dur="3.36">the odds I mean this is a something like</text>
  <text start="868.64" dur="3.09">Nazi</text>
  <text start="869.54" dur="4.8">yeah Hitler or maybe like a linen would</text>
  <text start="871.73" dur="5.1">do this is insane you don&amp;#39;t get to say</text>
  <text start="874.34" dur="4.08">well we lost the seats and the votes and</text>
  <text start="876.83" dur="3">such and we don&amp;#39;t you know we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="878.42" dur="3.18">winning anymore in the people&amp;#39;s opinion</text>
  <text start="879.83" dur="3">so we&amp;#39;re just gonna add some seats and</text>
  <text start="881.6" dur="2.58">put our buddies on there so we can take</text>
  <text start="882.83" dur="4.11">it back it&amp;#39;s okay we don&amp;#39;t need any</text>
  <text start="884.18" dur="5.04">permission or anything to do that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="886.94" dur="5.13">better that&amp;#39;s their attitude now we also</text>
  <text start="889.22" dur="5.42">have briefly or she totally banned Alana</text>
  <text start="892.07" dur="5.19">more or banned from Israel okay so</text>
  <text start="894.64" dur="4.12">that&amp;#39;s not a surprise I&amp;#39;m actually</text>
  <text start="897.26" dur="4.92">surprised that hadn&amp;#39;t already happened</text>
  <text start="898.76" dur="6.27">and we also have deep state IRS employee</text>
  <text start="902.18" dur="4.89">John fry cleaning guilty to leaking</text>
  <text start="905.03" dur="4.8">Michael Cohen&amp;#39;s bank records to avenatti</text>
  <text start="907.07" dur="4.71">faces up to five years in prison I hope</text>
  <text start="909.83" dur="4.08">that he gets it not because I&amp;#39;m a fan of</text>
  <text start="911.78" dur="5.37">Michael Cohen by any means he just seems</text>
  <text start="913.91" dur="4.89">like a slimy guy anyway but because the</text>
  <text start="917.15" dur="4.05">IRS targeting people especially</text>
  <text start="918.8" dur="4.8">conservatives is a trend it&amp;#39;s a culture</text>
  <text start="921.2" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s not a one-off and they need to be</text>
  <text start="923.6" dur="3.43">made examples of so that they don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="925.25" dur="3.31">it otherwise</text>
  <text start="927.03" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re just gonna keep on doing it and</text>
  <text start="928.56" dur="3.12">we saw a lot of that under Obama didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="930.66" dur="2.97">we and they&amp;#39;re the same people are</text>
  <text start="931.68" dur="4.5">largely still there I mean you know</text>
  <text start="933.63" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;ve been stacking the system</text>
  <text start="936.18" dur="4.5">with their their culture and their their</text>
  <text start="938.19" dur="4.44">political party for a very long time and</text>
  <text start="940.68" dur="3.63">let&amp;#39;s be honest if if we don&amp;#39;t get more</text>
  <text start="942.63" dur="4.14">conservatives in those positions and</text>
  <text start="944.31" dur="3.9">government you know then what happens</text>
  <text start="946.77" dur="2.67">then you know they just take over every</text>

  <text start="967.38" dur="5.64">government&amp;#39;s position can always be pay</text>
  <text start="969.99" dur="5.22">up f you because you have to write so</text>
