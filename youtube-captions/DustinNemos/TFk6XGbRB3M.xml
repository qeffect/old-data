  <text start="222.3" dur="3.24">another story I have the boomerang of</text>
  <text start="223.98" dur="4.56">the return to bill Barr who was the</text>
  <text start="225.54" dur="6.11">former AG under Bush but anyway Durham</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="6.59">has a colorful history in a good history</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="6.58">he was loaned out he was the assistant</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="6.1">US attorney for Connecticut when Obama</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="7.289">first took office in o8 and Durham was</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="7.65">loaned out to to come and work for four</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="5.491">years I mean it was a a long personal</text>
  <text start="248.88" dur="4.139">assignment he had to move down to</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="4.44">Virginia but he spearheaded the whole</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="5.4">and Obama this was one of his pet peeves</text>
  <text start="255.45" dur="7.05">is to go into the whole CIA torture the</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="8.241">renditions the albergue a garage all the</text>
  <text start="262.5" dur="6.63">stuff that happened under Bush so Durham</text>
  <text start="266.66" dur="5.05">spearheaded a special task force it was</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="5.52">look into all the past CIA&amp;#39;s and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.71" dur="4.709">what we came up with all the the new</text>
  <text start="274.65" dur="5.85">torture requirements and so forth all</text>
  <text start="276.419" dur="6.541">all that came out of obama mandating</text>
  <text start="280.5" dur="4.89">that he he look into all this there was</text>
  <text start="282.96" dur="6.3">a lot of videotape evidence that was</text>
  <text start="285.39" dur="5.88">destroyed so forth but that that was</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="4.529">something that durham had done back</text>
  <text start="291.27" dur="4.95">there between oh eight and twelve but</text>
  <text start="293.789" dur="5.671">before that and again some of this has</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="7.86">been immortalized in hit TV shows but in</text>
  <text start="299.46" dur="6.63">the late 90s he was a task to clean up</text>
  <text start="304.08" dur="4.37">Boston the organized crime a lot of</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="6.14">people will remember the stories about</text>
  <text start="308.45" dur="5.82">whitey bulger but the the movie that or</text>
  <text start="312.23" dur="3.09">the story that stuck to me because I did</text>
  <text start="314.27" dur="2.37">like this movie and some of the</text>
  <text start="315.32" dur="4.08">characters and it was the movie about</text>
  <text start="316.64" dur="6.6">the departed with Leonardo DiCaprio and</text>
  <text start="319.4" dur="6.54">that he&amp;#39;ll cry the that was based kind</text>
  <text start="323.24" dur="5.55">of partially but about what was going on</text>
  <text start="325.94" dur="4.77">with the the the organized crime</text>
  <text start="328.79" dur="4.02">syndicates in Boston and in the New</text>
  <text start="330.71" dur="5.82">England area and the attempts to clean</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="5.1">it up and again we have obviously we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="3">finding out that there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="337.91" dur="4.29">shenanigans that went into that whole</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="4.88">Whitey Bulger thing we need to find out</text>
  <text start="342.2" dur="6.36">more as far as the involvement with the</text>
  <text start="344.41" dur="6.49">FBI under Mahler during this whole time</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="3.99">as well so these these things will be</text>
  <text start="350.9" dur="4.08">forthcoming hopefully as part of our</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="9.42">final Great Awakening in questions to be</text>
  <text start="354.98" dur="8.67">answered but the dorm right now is a I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="361.97" dur="4.08">saying and other people are saying that</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="6.15">he is the second prosecutor that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="6.45">working under Horowitz and working in</text>
  <text start="369.8" dur="4.56">conjunction with John Huber q had let</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="5.76">this out I just wanted to give an exact</text>
  <text start="374.36" dur="7.98">quote that was on December 11th Q post</text>
  <text start="378.26" dur="6.8">two 603 and it reads what if there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="382.34" dur="4.92">outside prosecutor outside of DC</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="5.8">assigned by sessions with the same</text>
  <text start="387.26" dur="5.58">mandate and authority so this would be</text>
  <text start="390.86" dur="4.38">another prosecutor and this is what</text>
  <text start="392.84" dur="4.79">started the whole lot assert shortly</text>
  <text start="395.24" dur="5.52">after that magically meadows and Jordans</text>
  <text start="397.63" dur="4.99">have prompted the name of this this</text>
  <text start="400.76" dur="3.87">person that&amp;#39;s working with them so that</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="6.57">that would be John the Durham is our</text>
  <text start="404.63" dur="6.93">best guess as far as who and again I was</text>
  <text start="409.19" dur="4.29">listening to one of fiesty cat&amp;#39;s advice</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="3.75">to get friends shows and they had</text>
  <text start="413.48" dur="3.6">mentioned that perhaps there&amp;#39;s even more</text>
  <text start="415.31" dur="3.27">there&amp;#39;s been talk that there&amp;#39;s someone</text>
  <text start="417.08" dur="3.69">but in Little Rock that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="4.08">spearheading the Clinton Foundation and</text>
  <text start="420.77" dur="3.72">there are our effect would be the third</text>
  <text start="422.66" dur="5.22">special prosecutor so there&amp;#39;s a few more</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="4.95">yet to be uncovered and named and again</text>
  <text start="427.88" dur="4.82">this is the way it always used to be</text>
  <text start="429.44" dur="3.26">these these federal</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="6.66">the grand juries these investigations</text>
  <text start="435.85" dur="5.55">these these criminal probes always were</text>
  <text start="439.54" dur="5.64">kept in secret and never leaked out and</text>
  <text start="441.4" dur="8.46">never done by a mainstream media news</text>
  <text start="445.18" dur="7.14">coverages the second character here this</text>
  <text start="449.86" dur="5.01">is all part of about 200 of these</text>
  <text start="452.32" dur="4.65">articles that read it the characters of</text>
  <text start="454.87" dur="6.36">Obama Gate I thought I picked that good</text>
  <text start="456.97" dur="6.33">bad and ugly people and here&amp;#39;s obviously</text>
  <text start="461.23" dur="4.59">one of the the worst would be a James</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="6.69">clapper this would be an article Y</text>
  <text start="465.82" dur="8.49">titled - James the hammer clapper the</text>
  <text start="469.99" dur="7.76">hammer being a NSA surveillance program</text>
  <text start="474.31" dur="7.86">this was uncovered through the Snowden</text>
  <text start="477.75" dur="7.06">leaks this is one of their tool spying</text>
  <text start="482.17" dur="5.28">tools is implemented and used I believe</text>
  <text start="484.81" dur="4.62">it actually was developed under Bush but</text>
  <text start="487.45" dur="4.02">it was implemented against the public</text>
  <text start="489.43" dur="5.78">under Obama during his eight years of</text>
  <text start="491.47" dur="6.69">his eight-year reign but nevertheless a</text>
  <text start="495.21" dur="6">clapper has a long background he was a</text>
  <text start="498.16" dur="5.31">lieutenant general in the Air Force he</text>
  <text start="501.21" dur="4.69">you know has had a long career with the</text>
  <text start="503.47" dur="4.92">military in the government obviously the</text>
  <text start="505.9" dur="5.46">he previously held the same position to</text>
  <text start="508.39" dur="6.959">General Michael Flynn had which was DIA</text>
  <text start="511.36" dur="9.84">director of the defense intelligence</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="10.671">agencies and and again he was appointed</text>
  <text start="521.2" dur="7.47">by Obama he was actually the fourth DNI</text>
  <text start="526.02" dur="5.35">ever it&amp;#39;s kind of been a new position</text>
  <text start="528.67" dur="5.31">where they&amp;#39;ve gathered up all the 17</text>
  <text start="531.37" dur="5.07">different telogen s-- agencies dia that</text>
  <text start="533.98" dur="6.42">were just mentioned from the defense</text>
  <text start="536.44" dur="6.57">industry the intelligence arms of of all</text>
  <text start="540.4" dur="5.97">the different departments and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="543.01" dur="7.76">under one and again the public was made</text>
  <text start="546.37" dur="8.79">keenly aware of these 17 agencies when</text>
  <text start="550.77" dur="9.48">in the waning moments of Obama&amp;#39;s second</text>
  <text start="555.16" dur="8.75">term he instructed clapper to put up the</text>
  <text start="560.25" dur="7.649">get together and do a report from all 17</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="6.299">agencies and stroszek was involved with</text>
  <text start="567.899" dur="4.351">that brennan obviously and the clapper</text>
  <text start="570.209" dur="6.57">spearheaded gathering that all up and</text>
  <text start="572.25" dur="6.629">miss was their famous intelligence</text>
  <text start="576.779" dur="3.961">analysis from the agencies that they</text>
  <text start="578.879" dur="3.27">came out with and and said yes</text>
  <text start="580.74" dur="3.659">absolutely</text>
  <text start="582.149" dur="5.161">you know the russia was involved with</text>
  <text start="584.399" dur="5.75">the tampering of the 16 election to a</text>
  <text start="587.31" dur="5.969">benefit trump and to hinder hillary and</text>
  <text start="590.149" dur="6.011">this was part of their backup because</text>
  <text start="593.279" dur="5.581">they had already had the crossfire</text>
  <text start="596.16" dur="7.2">hurricane and all the spying and all the</text>
  <text start="598.86" dur="7.49">the stuff ahead of time so when this is</text>
  <text start="603.36" dur="5.969">combined 17 agencies and intelligence</text>
  <text start="606.35" dur="6.849">report came out there in early january</text>
  <text start="609.329" dur="5.7">is this was not the beginning of it as</text>
  <text start="613.199" dur="6.361">far as the blackcats but this was some</text>
  <text start="615.029" dur="6.571">of the public lacing that the that they</text>
  <text start="619.56" dur="4.949">did along with their cohorts from the</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="4.95">mockingbirds media to instill this</text>
  <text start="624.509" dur="4.981">narrative into the public this was their</text>
  <text start="626.55" dur="5.519">some of the rationale is that all 17</text>
  <text start="629.49" dur="4.649">agencies and again mind you NSA and</text>
  <text start="632.069" dur="5.731">Admiral Rogers never did sign off on</text>
  <text start="634.139" dur="6.51">that so you know if you can even believe</text>
  <text start="637.8" dur="4.889">how they lied it was 16 at best because</text>
  <text start="640.649" dur="4.56">that Mirage is has already said he did</text>
  <text start="642.689" dur="6.33">not agree with this combined</text>
  <text start="645.209" dur="9.291">intelligence report but the two main</text>
  <text start="649.019" dur="7.891">things that or public blemishes on</text>
  <text start="654.5" dur="5.05">clappers career obviously I just</text>
  <text start="656.91" dur="4.65">mentioned Snowden and and again that all</text>
  <text start="659.55" dur="5.7">happened under his watch so he was the</text>
  <text start="661.56" dur="6.209">ultimate responsibility to letting the</text>
  <text start="665.25" dur="5.37">chickens out of the henhouse because the</text>
  <text start="667.769" dur="6.5">all the the files and the information</text>
  <text start="670.62" dur="8.43">that that selects known took from NSA</text>
  <text start="674.269" dur="7.361">was was his responsibility again we have</text>
  <text start="679.05" dur="5.64">found out through q luckily that</text>
  <text start="681.63" dur="7.1">that in fact he was Snowden was sent in</text>
  <text start="684.69" dur="7.02">by the CIA he was a CIA asset</text>
  <text start="688.73" dur="5.77">operational person for them for a while</text>
  <text start="691.71" dur="5.88">and was sent in deliberately to sabotage</text>
  <text start="694.5" dur="5.52">to steal this information and to make to</text>
  <text start="697.59" dur="3.75">kind of hinder and destroy NSA so that</text>
  <text start="700.02" dur="3.33">CIA could be the predominant</text>
  <text start="701.34" dur="4.14">intelligence things and again this was</text>
  <text start="703.35" dur="4.68">all part of the sixteen year plan they</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="4.26">were to smoothly go in in to crush NSA</text>
  <text start="708.03" dur="3.57">when Hillary took over as the other</text>
  <text start="709.74" dur="4.53">eight years plans after Obama said</text>
  <text start="711.6" dur="7.26">everything up kind of like teeing up a</text>
  <text start="714.27" dur="6.09">little kids baseball t-ball Obama set it</text>
  <text start="718.86" dur="3.9">up in Hillary was going to knock it out</text>
  <text start="720.36" dur="4.02">of the park as this was just what with</text>
  <text start="722.76" dur="4.05">one of their things besides space and</text>
  <text start="724.38" dur="8">everything else they were destroyed but</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="7.44">that the the second big blemish on</text>
  <text start="732.38" dur="3.25">clappers career and it haunts him to</text>
  <text start="734.25" dur="4.38">this day every time they mentioned they</text>
  <text start="735.63" dur="8.64">talk about the big lie when when clapper</text>
  <text start="738.63" dur="9.06">was asked directly in a Senate panel</text>
  <text start="744.27" dur="5.81">there Senator Ron lines I think had</text>
  <text start="747.69" dur="6.39">asked him the question about the</text>
  <text start="750.08" dur="7.75">surveillance on the public and you know</text>
  <text start="754.08" dur="6.18">clapper infamously said no sir we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="757.83" dur="5.07">never do that wittingly</text>
  <text start="760.26" dur="5.91">and again everybody remembers him lying</text>
  <text start="762.9" dur="5.31">because this was just in advance Snowden</text>
  <text start="766.17" dur="3.99">had already stolen the information so I</text>
  <text start="768.21" dur="3.63">mean how bad can you be because you</text>
  <text start="770.16" dur="4.5">already know that the informations going</text>
  <text start="771.84" dur="5.01">to become available you know rather soon</text>
  <text start="774.66" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s already been taken so this was in</text>
  <text start="776.85" dur="5.94">between the time Snowden took it left or</text>
  <text start="779.91" dur="4.77">was taking the information and when he</text>
  <text start="782.79" dur="4.31">had released it to publicly I think it</text>
  <text start="784.68" dur="5.04">was about a month later as when that</text>
  <text start="787.1" dur="5.26">when he was on with the Greenwald and</text>
  <text start="789.72" dur="4.71">all from Hong Kong so again this was all</text>
  <text start="792.36" dur="5.67">in the same time period future proofs</text>
  <text start="794.43" dur="6.3">past but the hammer program was part of</text>
  <text start="798.03" dur="5.55">this whole thing a hom are and they just</text>
  <text start="800.73" dur="5.76">call it the hammer for a nickname these</text>
  <text start="803.58" dur="5.6">guys loved their nicknames dragon FISA</text>
  <text start="806.49" dur="7.4">cross about hurricane what-have-you</text>
  <text start="809.18" dur="7.87">mid-year review but the hammer was a</text>
  <text start="813.89" dur="4.93">program and death I didn&amp;#39;t see any of</text>
  <text start="817.05" dur="3.54">the Binney it&amp;#39;s almost something like</text>
  <text start="818.82" dur="4.89">Benny I think it&amp;#39;s been since Benny and</text>
  <text start="820.59" dur="5.04">Drake were involved but it taps into</text>
  <text start="823.71" dur="4.98">everybody&amp;#39;s cell phone regardless of the</text>
  <text start="825.63" dur="5.91">brand the model and it can just take it</text>
  <text start="828.69" dur="4.68">over this is how we&amp;#39;re you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.54" dur="4.44">let on to be some of these pictures that</text>
  <text start="833.37" dur="4.77">have been released in the drops have</text>
  <text start="835.98" dur="4.56">been come from the blackcats own phones</text>
  <text start="838.14" dur="4.11">they even wonder health you know so this</text>
  <text start="840.54" dur="4.98">is part of the program where they cannot</text>
  <text start="842.25" dur="5.13">only listen to your calls record the</text>
  <text start="845.52" dur="5.1">data that goes through as far as with</text>
  <text start="847.38" dur="5.34">text EMS emails what-have-you but they</text>
  <text start="850.62" dur="4.2">actually physically can take control of</text>
  <text start="852.72" dur="4.02">your phone of your camera of the</text>

  <text start="864.72" dur="3.69">can access the drill back and access</text>
  <text start="866.79" dur="6.03">that too so this was all part of the</text>
  <text start="868.41" dur="6.6">hammer program that was not only in</text>
  <text start="872.82" dur="3.99">existence but implemented by Obama</text>
