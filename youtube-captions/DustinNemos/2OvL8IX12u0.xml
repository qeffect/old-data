  <text start="128.42" dur="5.94">owners recognize that on one end on one</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="5.01">hand it&amp;#39;s a right guaranteed in the US</text>
  <text start="134.36" dur="4.92">Constitution but like all rights in the</text>
  <text start="136.76" dur="4.67">Constitution it&amp;#39;s appropriately subject</text>
  <text start="139.28" dur="5.1">to reasonable regulation and restriction</text>
  <text start="141.43" dur="5.77">guys that is the language of tyrants</text>
  <text start="144.38" dur="4.919">okay that is the 1984 George Orwell</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="5.039">right there okay that is double speak</text>
  <text start="149.299" dur="5.31">before give up your rights okay we can</text>
  <text start="152.239" dur="5.011">we can get rid of your ice with it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.609" dur="4.651">convenient for the ruling class no you</text>
  <text start="157.25" dur="4.019">have everyone has the right to defend</text>
  <text start="159.26" dur="3.72">themselves this is a natural way I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="161.269" dur="3.631">need the Constitution to tell me I have</text>
  <text start="162.98" dur="4.879">the natural right to defend myself with</text>
  <text start="164.9" dur="6.45">whatever I choose is appropriate okay</text>
  <text start="167.859" dur="5.171">that said the Constitution did go a long</text>
  <text start="171.35" dur="3.15">ways toward enshrining some of those</text>
  <text start="173.03" dur="2.549">natural rights that&amp;#39;s why before I</text>
  <text start="174.5" dur="4.519">became a volunteer</text>
  <text start="175.579" dur="6.121">I was a strict strict limited government</text>
  <text start="179.019" dur="5.381">constitutionalist okay as strict as you</text>
  <text start="181.7" dur="4.2">can get as limited as you can get and as</text>
  <text start="184.4" dur="3.72">constitutional as you can get in the</text>
  <text start="185.9" dur="4.83">likes of a Ron Paul okay whom I still</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="3.959">admire greatly and I think they cheated</text>
  <text start="190.73" dur="2.089">him out of the president I guess he was</text>
  <text start="192.079" dur="4.52">no trouble though</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="5.73">and you know Comey coming out with this</text>
  <text start="196.599" dur="3.51">kind of anti peasant gun control</text>
  <text start="198.549" dur="3">rhetoric is no surprise of course</text>
  <text start="200.109" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re really pushing guns because they</text>
  <text start="201.549" dur="4.17">really are afraid that we&amp;#39;re about to</text>
  <text start="203.109" dur="4.11">have a revolution and what can they do</text>
  <text start="205.719" dur="5.121">they can&amp;#39;t bring in foreign armies or</text>
  <text start="207.219" dur="5.731">heat or even UN troops to suppress us</text>
  <text start="210.84" dur="3.88">because not only would they not meet our</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="4.2">military if they did beat our military</text>
  <text start="214.72" dur="4.409">just like the Japanese general said you</text>
  <text start="217.15" dur="6.5">would find a blade a gun hiding behind</text>
  <text start="219.129" dur="6.871">every blade of grass so that&amp;#39;s a punch</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="3.85">and that&amp;#39;s absolutely true in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="226" dur="3.18">because there are a lot of people here</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="3.989">who have a lot vested in this country</text>
  <text start="229.18" dur="3.75">and want freedom and will die to protect</text>
  <text start="231.489" dur="3.03">it or at least risk their lives to</text>
  <text start="232.93" dur="6.27">protect it and have a lot of weapons and</text>
  <text start="234.519" dur="6.481">ammo and practice shooting moving on the</text>
  <text start="239.2" dur="3.84">ice protester who created the four-hour</text>
  <text start="241" dur="4.76">standoff after climbing the Statue of</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="4.83">Liberty is an immigrant from the Congo</text>
  <text start="245.76" dur="4.3">Hilla like you I&amp;#39;m telling you</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="5.1">some some nations just give you low IQ</text>
  <text start="250.06" dur="5.6">people all right and that&amp;#39;s unfortunate</text>
  <text start="252.97" dur="4.799">and you don&amp;#39;t want to get open borders</text>
  <text start="255.66" dur="4.09">immigration access to everyone because</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="3.33">then the worst will show in the early</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="2.729">days of the u.s. you kind of had a brain</text>
  <text start="261.099" dur="3.661">drain from other countries and you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="262.479" dur="5.101">got the smartest which is very cool and</text>
  <text start="264.76" dur="3.93">helped us a lot and now those smart</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="2.64">people who went back to their countries</text>
  <text start="268.69" dur="6.15">and now they have like Silicon Valley&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.22" dur="6.09">all over the world it&amp;#39;s of course they</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="4.829">kind of plundered our knowledge a little</text>
  <text start="276.31" dur="6.829">bit in some ways now an update on the</text>
  <text start="279.669" dur="7.021">Iranian official alright involved in the</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="5.56">plot to the terrorist plot to bomb the</text>
  <text start="286.69" dur="5.67">Paris conference with some top</text>
  <text start="288.699" dur="5.701">dignitaries from the US and some of the</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="2.97">Middle Eastern nations leaders were</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="2.28">there</text>
  <text start="295.33" dur="3.39">apparently an Iranian official</text>
  <text start="296.68" dur="5.22">personally gave the bomb to terrorists</text>
  <text start="298.72" dur="5.629">okay this is from the gateway pundit Wow</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s basically an act of war I mean</text>
  <text start="304.349" dur="4.481">Iran could maybe arrest the guy and then</text>
  <text start="307.33" dur="3.329">throw him away and make an example of</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="3.959">him and say look we didn&amp;#39;t condone this</text>
  <text start="310.659" dur="4.081">and kind of distance himself from it but</text>
  <text start="312.789" dur="3.781">are they going to do that right now in</text>
  <text start="314.74" dur="3.929">the middle of all this like rhetoric</text>
  <text start="316.57" dur="3.26">about a nuclear stuff and everything</text>
  <text start="318.669" dur="5.061">else going on and</text>
  <text start="319.83" dur="6.57">I I don&amp;#39;t know I mean that&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="3.51">like a an excuse to like mom the crap</text>
  <text start="326.4" dur="5.31">out of them though</text>
  <text start="327.24" dur="6.69">if Trump wanted to the UK is pulling</text>
  <text start="331.71" dur="3.99">Tommy Robinson&amp;#39;s a pill date so he is</text>
  <text start="333.93" dur="4.53">basically just gonna rot until they</text>
  <text start="335.7" dur="5.16">decide until they&amp;#39;re ready this is a</text>
  <text start="338.46" dur="5.04">screw-up guys this is why in the US we</text>
  <text start="340.86" dur="5.79">have rights like the right to a speedy</text>
  <text start="343.5" dur="5.76">trial the Secret Service officer</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="6.09">assaulted outside of the White House</text>

  <text start="352.74" dur="2.94">leftist was screaming where&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="354.45" dur="3.59">president where&amp;#39;s the where&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="5.07">president okay</text>
  <text start="358.04" dur="4.96">mayhem in Philly police are have</text>
  <text start="360.75" dur="4.59">arrested 29 far-left protesters after</text>
  <text start="363" dur="3.63">violence erupts of course it&amp;#39;s a nice</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="3.33">building okay this is more</text>
  <text start="366.63" dur="3.99">anti-immigration stuff they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="368.67" dur="4.83">this at all of these different ice</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="5.07">centers you know they&amp;#39;re blocking buses</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="3.93">you can&amp;#39;t get through to take the</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="3.78">immigrants anywhere when you have</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="3.24">arrested them which is probably no fun</text>
  <text start="379.47" dur="2.42">for the immigrants either because then</text>
  <text start="380.67" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re sitting there bored as hell</text>
  <text start="381.89" dur="6.4">maybe possibly even in some heat which I</text>
  <text start="386.43" dur="3.15">think this heat wave we&amp;#39;re having by the</text>
  <text start="388.29" dur="4.68">way is probably why you&amp;#39;re not seeing</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="5.37">too much too much protesting in black</text>
  <text start="392.97" dur="4.2">man Tifa wouldn&amp;#39;t that just be</text>
  <text start="394.95" dur="4.2">convenient they show up and just sweat</text>
  <text start="397.17" dur="5">themselves unconscious and we can arrest</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="3.02">them all easily</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="4.44">I want to mention about the Supreme</text>
  <text start="406.5" dur="3.84">Court I had a note to mention this I</text>
  <text start="407.94" dur="4.26">basically people are getting confident</text>
  <text start="410.34" dur="3.51">right because we have this majority of</text>
  <text start="412.2" dur="4.92">Supreme Court things coming down the</text>
  <text start="413.85" dur="5.31">road here don&amp;#39;t be all right this still</text>
  <text start="417.12" dur="3.66">hinges entirely on the trunk</text>
  <text start="419.16" dur="5.4">magda movement all right if they take</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="6.72">Trump out or they stop him</text>
  <text start="424.56" dur="4.29">or the Democrats get power back then</text>
  <text start="427.5" dur="2.85">it&amp;#39;s just good they&amp;#39;re what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="428.85" dur="3.66">gonna do they&amp;#39;ve already basically said</text>
  <text start="430.35" dur="3.72">it they&amp;#39;re gonna add more seats to the</text>
  <text start="432.51" dur="3.63">Supreme Court so that they can then</text>
  <text start="434.07" dur="4.53">stack them with leftist and have a</text>
  <text start="436.14" dur="3.96">Supreme Court majority for them again</text>
  <text start="438.6" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s basically cheating the will of the</text>
  <text start="440.1" dur="5.4">people in order to push their their</text>
  <text start="443.52" dur="3.87">agenda because you know we don&amp;#39;t deserve</text>
  <text start="445.5" dur="7.59">to have an opinion unless it agrees with</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="7.56">the elite and the left what can I tell</text>
  <text start="453.09" dur="6.27">you folks it&amp;#39;s true anyone make this</text>
  <text start="454.95" dur="5.969">stuff up it&amp;#39;s basically you know not in</text>
  <text start="459.36" dur="4.61">line with the voting populous basically</text>
  <text start="460.919" dur="7.471">and it&amp;#39;s just disrespectful to voters</text>
  <text start="463.97" dur="6.61">there are apparently reports that the</text>
  <text start="468.39" dur="4.17">Mexican president is going to travel</text>
  <text start="470.58" dur="3.75">around without any visible security</text>
  <text start="472.56" dur="5.43">detail and he&amp;#39;s saying that the people</text>
  <text start="474.33" dur="7.68">will protect him the context here is</text>
  <text start="477.99" dur="5.58">that this is an election pretty landmark</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="3.3">election really where there&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="5.64">been over 100 mysteriously dead</text>
  <text start="485.31" dur="5.76">political hits in Mexico okay so the</text>
  <text start="489.21" dur="3.33">only reason they new politician will be</text>
  <text start="491.07" dur="3.84">walking around saying the people will</text>
  <text start="492.54" dur="6.33">protect me is that you&amp;#39;re behind those</text>
  <text start="494.91" dur="6.92">hits just in my opinion no proof</text>
  <text start="498.87" dur="8.39">obviously but you know</text>
  <text start="501.83" dur="7.02">you know reason evidence I guess no</text>
  <text start="507.26" dur="4.59">evidence in that one but you know reason</text>
  <text start="508.85" dur="5.96">at least in this case brave words in an</text>
  <text start="511.85" dur="5.16">election with over 100 mysteriously done</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="5.13">now Pruitt</text>

  <text start="535.97" dur="5.22">recently asked Trump to fire sessions</text>
  <text start="538.94" dur="4.32">and named him as the Attorney General so</text>
  <text start="541.19" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s kind of weird that he would then</text>
  <text start="543.26" dur="3">immediately stepped out maybe he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="2.79">it because Trump said no and he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="546.26" dur="1.77">like I&amp;#39;m not gonna deal with this crap</text>
  <text start="547.4" dur="2.25">anymore</text>

  <text start="584.84" dur="4.47">I could understand why an administration</text>
  <text start="587.45" dur="4.38">official one of the Trump campaign would</text>
  <text start="589.31" dur="4.26">want to get out of that right especially</text>
  <text start="591.83" dur="4.38">if he thinks that you know the boss is</text>
  <text start="593.57" dur="4.68">in like a pansy and a week about things</text>
  <text start="596.21" dur="3.72">when he should just come down hard</text>
  <text start="598.25" dur="3.32">obviously Trump has to play the long</text>
  <text start="599.93" dur="3.6">game that can play chess not checkers</text>
  <text start="601.57" dur="3.4">even if he were to do that which he</text>
  <text start="603.53" dur="3.06">could like other Democrats take them</text>
  <text start="604.97" dur="4.62">over and arrest them then you would have</text>
  <text start="606.59" dur="4.32">every other leader that hates Trump as</text>
  <text start="609.59" dur="5.91">well then trying to use that as a</text>
  <text start="610.91" dur="6.15">pretext to go anti us in a big way until</text>
  <text start="615.5" dur="4.86">Trump was taken down and basically it</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="6.54">would be a bad a bad time I think we</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="5.4">would rally behind Trump this kind of</text>
  <text start="623.6" dur="3.75">thing has happened that has been done</text>
  <text start="625.76" dur="3.92">before and people have rally behind your</text>
  <text start="627.35" dur="4.5">leaders despite all that pressure but</text>
  <text start="629.68" dur="4.51">it&amp;#39;s better to go this way it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="631.85" dur="7.83">bit safer I think in Trump hue they seem</text>
  <text start="634.19" dur="7.14">to be on top of it the UK all right now</text>
  <text start="639.68" dur="4.5">first I&amp;#39;m gonna before I even go through</text>
  <text start="641.33" dur="5.25">this part I think is Sadiq Khan or</text>
  <text start="644.18" dur="6">whatever the the London Mayor crazy</text>
  <text start="646.58" dur="6.39">extremist Muslim basically has okayed</text>
  <text start="650.18" dur="5.46">the use of a like I think it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="652.97" dur="5.4">nine meter tall blimp of a giant baby</text>
  <text start="655.64" dur="4.55">Trump like an angry baby Trump just like</text>
  <text start="658.37" dur="5.07">a big insult like in a pill to ridicule</text>
  <text start="660.19" dur="4.96">and they&amp;#39;re gonna fly it on his new on</text>
  <text start="663.44" dur="6.99">his visit in just a few days to the UK</text>
  <text start="665.15" dur="6.9">he&amp;#39;s approved this so some honey on</text>
  <text start="670.43" dur="4.47">Twitter actually started to say well I</text>
  <text start="672.05" dur="7.83">hope that he certainly approves my giant</text>
  <text start="674.9" dur="6.42">Mohammed for the same day so that would</text>
  <text start="679.88" dur="2.73">be kind of funny I guess I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="681.32" dur="3.66">how you be able to prove one and all the</text>

  <text start="689.02" dur="2.79">he won&amp;#39;t be killed for it because you</text>
  <text start="690.34" dur="3.66">know how Muslims are they they go after</text>
  <text start="691.81" dur="4.77">people that make fun of Mohammed just</text>
  <text start="694" dur="5.37">look at the draw Muhammad contests but</text>
  <text start="696.58" dur="5.25">the UK in a more serious note is</text>
  <text start="699.37" dur="4.29">reportedly telling Trump that he cannot</text>
  <text start="701.83" dur="4.02">meet with brexit architect</text>
  <text start="703.66" dur="4.89">Nigel Faraj all right now Nigel Faraj</text>
  <text start="705.85" dur="5.19">for those who don&amp;#39;t know kind of started</text>
  <text start="708.55" dur="4.59">all this in a big way with brexit all</text>
  <text start="711.04" dur="4.41">right he&amp;#39;s the man behind brexit he&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="713.14" dur="4.53">Trump in that he has you know that the</text>
  <text start="715.45" dur="5.73">head office or anything he&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="717.67" dur="5.46">voice but he&amp;#39;s a very influential and</text>
  <text start="721.18" dur="4.98">articulate and intelligent voice for</text>
  <text start="723.13" dur="6.96">reason and good now he&amp;#39;s sort of like</text>
  <text start="726.16" dur="7.26">the UK&amp;#39;s Trump in that sense he he is</text>
  <text start="730.09" dur="5.97">still fighting you know in the sidelines</text>
  <text start="733.42" dur="4.65">so for him to meet with Trump and for</text>
  <text start="736.06" dur="5.43">them to kind of develop some sort of</text>
  <text start="738.07" dur="5.61">camaraderie and relationship would not</text>
  <text start="741.49" dur="6">only set him up for future political</text>
  <text start="743.68" dur="6.75">power in the UK as a representative who</text>
  <text start="747.49" dur="5.31">has a great relationship with amazing</text>

  <text start="752.8" dur="5.37">the god Emperor anyway it would also it</text>
  <text start="756.76" dur="4.47">would it would change the world in a big</text>
  <text start="758.17" dur="5.25">way I mean the UK and America kind of</text>
  <text start="761.23" dur="5.01">set the pace for the Western world and</text>

  <text start="772.87" dur="4.26">for like gigs I think we can change the</text>
  <text start="775.96" dur="3.48">world I think when you take it back from</text>
  <text start="777.13" dur="3.769">evil and I think you would have a nation</text>
  <text start="779.44" dur="5.48">of</text>

  <text start="797.85" dur="5.159">respect relationship is far better than</text>
  <text start="799.889" dur="4.98">the kind of crony stuff were there</text>
  <text start="803.009" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;re basically talking all of the</text>
  <text start="804.869" dur="3.69">good things about helping the poor you</text>
  <text start="807.029" dur="3.36">know the leftist you know they they they</text>
  <text start="808.559" dur="4.291">say they cloak everything in morality</text>
  <text start="810.389" dur="5.341">and then they do disgustingly immoral</text>
  <text start="812.85" dur="4.229">things behind it behind that and no one</text>
  <text start="815.73" dur="2.519">questions them and when you do question</text>
  <text start="817.079" dur="5.76">them they come down on you and they</text>
  <text start="818.249" dur="6.06">destroy your life so fortunately there</text>

  <text start="898.079" dur="3.941">Isis involved</text>
  <text start="899.49" dur="5.11">but the fact that ice has been really</text>
  <text start="902.02" dur="4.8">pushing this child sex trafficking thing</text>
  <text start="904.6" dur="4.41">and Trump has been pushing this and the</text>
  <text start="906.82" dur="5.28">executive orders and all the talk and</text>
  <text start="909.01" dur="4.8">the media and and and Ivanka actually</text>
  <text start="912.1" dur="4.29">said thank you blessing for your</text>

  <text start="916.39" dur="4.23">tag and trafficking you are an</text>
  <text start="917.95" dur="4.83">inspiration to us all like there is a</text>
  <text start="920.62" dur="3.93">pattern being established here how often</text>
  <text start="922.78" dur="5.33">did you hear the term trafficking or</text>
  <text start="924.55" dur="7.2">human trafficking or child trafficking</text>
  <text start="928.11" dur="5.53">ten years ago you didn&amp;#39;t alright not</text>
  <text start="931.75" dur="3.39">often unless you were like maybe paying</text>
  <text start="933.64" dur="5.13">attention to the deepest circles of</text>
  <text start="935.14" dur="5.73">truth or zone right which I was but I</text>
  <text start="938.77" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t even realize it was that bad back</text>
  <text start="940.87" dur="6.21">then okay and I&amp;#39;m obsessed with research</text>
  <text start="942.79" dur="6.63">I admit that I&amp;#39;m plugged into this</text>
  <text start="947.08" dur="6.42">stupid matrix this is gonna be really</text>
  <text start="949.42" dur="6.6">bad for my eyes Monday but my point here</text>
  <text start="953.5" dur="5.04">is that just like with the deep state</text>
  <text start="956.02" dur="4.14">which is not a term you heard before</text>
  <text start="958.54" dur="4.65">Trump but then afterwards just like a</text>
  <text start="960.16" dur="6.87">household term just like the fake news</text>
  <text start="963.19" dur="6.51">was revealed as is now like a common</text>
  <text start="967.03" dur="4.38">expression right they started it and now</text>
  <text start="969.7" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re begging us to stop it and trying</text>
  <text start="971.41" dur="4.7">to hide behind dead journalists as an</text>
  <text start="973.24" dur="2.87">excuse to stop it</text>
  <text start="977.25" dur="4.2">this is this is part of something okay</text>
  <text start="979.08" dur="5.01">and this is the Q anon thing this is the</text>
  <text start="981.45" dur="4.53">Trump agenda behind the scenes and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.09" dur="4.26">really going after the pedophiles he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.98" dur="3.72">really going after the trafficking a lot</text>
  <text start="988.35" dur="3.24">of people are still trying to suggest</text>
  <text start="989.7" dur="3.66">that the Trump is involved with the</text>
  <text start="991.59" dur="4.17">pedophiles or that he is involved with</text>
  <text start="993.36" dur="3.65">the deep state or something to that</text>
  <text start="995.76" dur="3.72">extent</text>
  <text start="997.01" dur="4.81">there is a huge disconnect between those</text>
  <text start="999.48" dur="5.7">who think nothing is being done to drain</text>
  <text start="1001.82" dur="5.97">the swamp or think that Trump is this in</text>
  <text start="1005.18" dur="5.52">the actual reality of what is going on</text>
  <text start="1007.79" dur="5.01">both politically and culturally this is</text>
  <text start="1010.7" dur="3.54">the fruit of the tree doctrine okay this</text>
  <text start="1012.8" dur="3.69">is something that I talk about a lot</text>
  <text start="1014.24" dur="5.01">with women on in trouble the biggest</text>
  <text start="1016.49" dur="4.56">proof that they are not deep statement</text>
  <text start="1019.25" dur="5.79">is that they are revealing deep state</text>
  <text start="1021.05" dur="6.6">bad actors bad actions child trafficking</text>
  <text start="1025.04" dur="4.62">and propaganda Trump has destroyed the</text>
  <text start="1027.65" dur="3.78">MSM propaganda machine he has nullified</text>
  <text start="1029.66" dur="4.049">the judicial corruption that would seek</text>
  <text start="1031.43" dur="5.55">to target the good guys with crimes you</text>
  <text start="1033.709" dur="5.671">know like the corrupt FBI he&amp;#39;s tied them</text>
  <text start="1036.98" dur="5.7">up and destroyed their credibility he</text>
  <text start="1039.38" dur="5.97">has made the deep state like I said a</text>
  <text start="1042.68" dur="4.2">common household term everyone has heard</text>
  <text start="1045.35" dur="3.27">that now just like fake news and now</text>
  <text start="1046.88" dur="4.59">he&amp;#39;s moving us toward human trafficking</text>
  <text start="1048.62" dur="6.42">and child sex trafficking as a commonly</text>
  <text start="1051.47" dur="6.05">heard phrase in the media and from the</text>
  <text start="1055.04" dur="4.53">Trump&amp;#39;s themselves and from ice and</text>
  <text start="1057.52" dur="3.52">probably from everything else that Trump</text>
  <text start="1059.57" dur="3.15">has access to okay because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1061.04" dur="6.5">starting to see it injected into the</text>
  <text start="1062.72" dur="8.82">zeitgeist this is how genius-level</text>
  <text start="1067.54" dur="5.34">high-level politicians inject truth into</text>

  <text start="1072.88" dur="5.7">to prepare people okay good or bad all</text>
  <text start="1076.48" dur="3.48">right I understand that you see the same</text>
  <text start="1078.58" dur="3.66">kind of stuff with the left when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1079.96" dur="5.37">saying watch out for deep fake videos</text>
  <text start="1082.24" dur="5.01">okay because there&amp;#39;s videos coming that</text>
  <text start="1085.33" dur="4.02">are bad about Obama and Hillary and all</text>
  <text start="1087.25" dur="4.41">of that possibly Loretta Lynch and the</text>

  <text start="1091.66" dur="5.01">videos okay from the Weiner laptop which</text>
  <text start="1094.69" dur="6.51">involves Hillary possibly Huma and</text>
  <text start="1096.67" dur="7.77">children then the the deep fake is</text>
  <text start="1101.2" dur="5.69">everywhere now okay so just pay</text>
  <text start="1104.44" dur="5.67">attention to these kind of things um</text>
  <text start="1106.89" dur="5.98">compare this kind of keyword appearing</text>
  <text start="1110.11" dur="5.37">like I said in the last six months to</text>
  <text start="1112.87" dur="6.06">the last 60 years</text>

  <text start="1126.79" dur="3.63">I pay attention to this stuff every day</text>
  <text start="1127.96" dur="4.71">most of you probably do as well so</text>
  <text start="1130.42" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s kind of what I&amp;#39;m thinking it this</text>
  <text start="1132.67" dur="3.78">is a prelude to mass arrests this is a</text>
  <text start="1134.59" dur="3.87">prelude to pedophiles at high levels</text>
  <text start="1136.45" dur="3.63">this is a prelude to Pizza Gate this is</text>

  <text start="2334.37" dur="6.42">it&amp;#39;s really cool design or concept you</text>

  <text start="2384.02" dur="6.87">building not necessarily a particular</text>
  <text start="2386.18" dur="7.2">design concrete shells in a dome-like</text>

  <text start="2418.55" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re repair bills are nothing</text>
  <text start="2419.99" dur="4.05">compared to usual they can they can</text>

  <text start="2428.45" dur="6.39">incredible for what it can do for the</text>
  <text start="2430.07" dur="6.27">poor all right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="2434.84" dur="3.6">nother conversation right changing the</text>
  <text start="2436.34" dur="3.69">world but these these things are gonna</text>
  <text start="2438.44" dur="3.66">continue to be able to improve and</text>
  <text start="2440.03" dur="3.6">eventually we&amp;#39;re gonna have improved</text>
  <text start="2442.1" dur="5.79">styles the building that they can do as</text>
  <text start="2443.63" dur="7.26">well so right now we&amp;#39;re gonna have like</text>
  <text start="2447.89" dur="5.37">I said a fairly extensive experience as</text>
  <text start="2450.89" dur="4.65">a handyman myself and I built a small</text>
  <text start="2453.26" dur="3.87">cabin I can tell you that most of the</text>
  <text start="2455.54" dur="2.91">cost is the labor not being not the</text>
  <text start="2457.13" dur="3.33">materials okay I can actually build a</text>
  <text start="2458.45" dur="3.78">cabin fairly cheaply right like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2460.46" dur="3.78">just a small cabin in the woods it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2462.23" dur="3.69">couple thousand bucks not that bad but</text>
  <text start="2464.24" dur="4.89">the labor the time the effort the</text>
  <text start="2465.92" dur="4.47">knowledge the experience and if you</text>
  <text start="2469.13" dur="2.4">don&amp;#39;t have experience trust me there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2470.39" dur="3.36">gonna be a lot of trial and error and</text>
  <text start="2471.53" dur="4.98">cost associated with trial and error a</text>
  <text start="2473.75" dur="5.91">lot of time researching stuff if you can</text>
  <text start="2476.51" dur="5.16">just get rid of all that program up a</text>
  <text start="2479.66" dur="4.53">house on AutoCAD or whatever machine</text>
  <text start="2481.67" dur="6.84">this machine uses 3d software put it</text>
  <text start="2484.19" dur="4.92">into the machine go get launched come</text>
  <text start="2488.51" dur="3.75">back</text>
  <text start="2489.11" dur="4.5">machines halfway built a house and you</text>
  <text start="2492.26" dur="3.57">load that machine on the back of your</text>
  <text start="2493.61" dur="6.09">truck and go to the next one when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2495.83" dur="5.22">finished there will still be some cost</text>
  <text start="2499.7" dur="3.18">of homes right there would be material</text>
  <text start="2501.05" dur="4.35">cost wheel and cost those aren&amp;#39;t gonna</text>
  <text start="2502.88" dur="4.8">go away but it&amp;#39;s gonna be so much more</text>
  <text start="2505.4" dur="2.94">efficient you&amp;#39;ll see the cost of the</text>
  <text start="2507.68" dur="2.07">wood and</text>
  <text start="2508.34" dur="2.61">learn things go down because they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2509.75" dur="4.55">be wasting any the machine will be</text>
  <text start="2510.95" dur="5.91">perfect every time with its cuts just</text>
  <text start="2514.3" dur="4.57">like there are already some restaurants</text>
  <text start="2516.86" dur="3.69">served by fully robotic staffs we will</text>
  <text start="2518.87" dur="4.89">soon have widespread mass production of</text>
  <text start="2520.55" dur="5.07">homes and like I said since most the</text>
  <text start="2523.76" dur="4.47">cost is in the labor which includes the</text>
  <text start="2525.62" dur="3.84">the permits and the licenses and may</text>
  <text start="2528.23" dur="4.26">still need a permit but you certainly</text>
  <text start="2529.46" dur="4.29">won&amp;#39;t need a license with the machine or</text>
  <text start="2532.49" dur="5.04">at least maybe one license for the</text>
  <text start="2533.75" dur="5.01">machine itself but not for each not for</text>
  <text start="2537.53" dur="3.72">being able to I don&amp;#39;t know how it would</text>
  <text start="2538.76" dur="5.64">work exactly but you know a lot of these</text>
  <text start="2541.25" dur="7.32">things add a lot of cost permits and</text>
  <text start="2544.4" dur="7.32">licenses distort the market of supply</text>
  <text start="2548.57" dur="4.95">and demand and and just word-of-mouth</text>
  <text start="2551.72" dur="5.58">review systems which is the appropriate</text>
  <text start="2553.52" dur="5.55">way to go like Yelp right I would rather</text>
  <text start="2557.3" dur="4.11">use Yelp to determine if a restaurant is</text>
  <text start="2559.07" dur="4.2">good than I would the government to</text>
  <text start="2561.41" dur="3.66">judgment on a license as to whether or</text>
  <text start="2563.27" dur="4.44">not this person is competent does that</text>
  <text start="2565.07" dur="4.08">make sense there&amp;#39;s a lot of crookedness</text>
  <text start="2567.71" dur="3.96">in that industry and they really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2569.15" dur="4.62">even check these damn her homes for the</text>
  <text start="2571.67" dur="3.6">permits that they&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="2573.77" dur="3.6">issuing anyway they don&amp;#39;t even half the</text>
  <text start="2575.27" dur="3.6">time go in the light drive by like honk</text>
  <text start="2577.37" dur="5.28">at the guy be like yeah okay I checked</text>
  <text start="2578.87" dur="5.16">on it give me my money so you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2582.65" dur="4.26">really actually improving safety you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2584.03" dur="5.01">just improving cost with licenses and</text>
  <text start="2586.91" dur="4.53">permits and things of that nature</text>
  <text start="2589.04" dur="4.53">so it distorts the markets it raises</text>
  <text start="2591.44" dur="4.08">prices protecting the monopolies the</text>
  <text start="2593.57" dur="3.72">people with the licenses and the</text>
  <text start="2595.52" dur="4.71">bureaucrats getting served by the the</text>
  <text start="2597.29" dur="4.92">fees so my prep my prediction here is</text>
  <text start="2600.23" dur="4.68">that home prices will soon be a half of</text>
  <text start="2602.21" dur="6.18">what they were historically all right at</text>
  <text start="2604.91" dur="5.13">least and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m kind of going</text>
  <text start="2608.39" dur="4.65">into this topic in such a big fashion</text>
  <text start="2610.04" dur="4.53">like this is big you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve probably</text>
  <text start="2613.04" dur="3.24">seen the videos of these things being</text>
  <text start="2614.57" dur="4.2">tried over the past couple of years and</text>
  <text start="2616.28" dur="8.25">and you know kind of thought that&amp;#39;s neat</text>
  <text start="2618.77" dur="7.62">when will it happen will it start it may</text>
  <text start="2624.53" dur="4.59">be even as down as like a third of what</text>
  <text start="2626.39" dur="4.26">they were before so homes will be you</text>
  <text start="2629.12" dur="2.55">know if you own if you own a home and</text>
  <text start="2630.65" dur="2.58">you think that&amp;#39;s gonna maintain your</text>
  <text start="2631.67" dur="3.99">value and things like that you would</text>
  <text start="2633.23" dur="6.24">want to probably get away from that way</text>
  <text start="2635.66" dur="5.85">of thinking on the other hand if you</text>
  <text start="2639.47" dur="4.53">want to want a home it will soon be more</text>
  <text start="2641.51" dur="4.23">affordable than ever and better made</text>
  <text start="2644" dur="3.48">than ever and when they start adding in</text>
  <text start="2645.74" dur="4.13">that new technology like the monolithic</text>
  <text start="2647.48" dur="6.75">domes and things like that</text>
  <text start="2649.87" dur="7.18">now you&amp;#39;re saving him you know least 50%</text>

  <text start="2657.05" dur="4.47">percent in your repair costs you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2660.11" dur="4.74">really starting to get somewhere right</text>

  <text start="2664.85" dur="6.24">experience Star Trek you know something</text>
  <text start="2666.89" dur="6.12">like that just my opinion at the very</text>
