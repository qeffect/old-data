  <text start="469.63" dur="3.39">dying versus all of the other currencies</text>
  <text start="471.31" dur="3.15">in the world eventually maybe not</text>
  <text start="473.02" dur="3.959">currently because it looks like it&amp;#39;s the</text>

  <text start="529.75" dur="3.87">die and it&amp;#39;s probably a good thing for</text>
  <text start="531.279" dur="4.531">it to die because we need to get past</text>

  <text start="568.029" dur="4.68">ounce you see what the power of</text>
  <text start="569.23" dur="5.07">inflation does right that&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="572.709" dur="3.151">only one man in a million understands</text>
  <text start="574.3" dur="3.51">the power of inflation otherwise we have</text>
  <text start="575.86" dur="5.339">a revolt by tomorrow morning I think</text>
  <text start="577.81" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s a close to specific quote but I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="581.199" dur="3.361">like to get people the warning Trump</text>
  <text start="582.76" dur="3.629">isn&amp;#39;t lying to people he&amp;#39;s trying to do</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="3.57">the best he can to kick this thing down</text>
  <text start="586.389" dur="3.39">the road a little bit longer give us a</text>
  <text start="588.13" dur="3.24">chance to recover because they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="589.779" dur="4.141">getting all of the free handouts and all</text>
  <text start="591.37" dur="5.04">this other stuff but this is a plane</text>
  <text start="593.92" dur="4.229">that&amp;#39;s on fire and he&amp;#39;s gonna have to</text>
  <text start="596.41" dur="4.799">land it in emergency style at some point</text>
  <text start="598.149" dur="4.321">so drunk driving and fakes and I by the</text>
  <text start="601.209" dur="4.591">way I do think he&amp;#39;s the right guy for</text>
  <text start="602.47" dur="5.179">that job all right so drunk driving and</text>
  <text start="605.8" dur="5.88">fake science Wow</text>
  <text start="607.649" dur="7.451">so this apparently is telling people</text>
  <text start="611.68" dur="6.36">that the the actual technology behind</text>
  <text start="615.1" dur="5.549">them tens of thousands of cases possibly</text>
  <text start="618.04" dur="4.649">have been wrong cases are now being</text>
  <text start="620.649" dur="3.81">thrown out around the country the</text>
  <text start="622.689" dur="4.321">company that makes the machines that do</text>
  <text start="624.459" dur="4.591">the breathalyzer for the police stations</text>
  <text start="627.01" dur="3.629">won&amp;#39;t share its technology or submit to</text>
  <text start="629.05" dur="4.5">a serious scientific review of its</text>
  <text start="630.639" dur="5.01">technology lives are being ruined even</text>
  <text start="633.55" dur="3.959">as the evidence piles up that vast</text>
  <text start="635.649" dur="5.37">numbers of arrests for drunk driving are</text>
  <text start="637.509" dur="6.27">wholly bogus Wow</text>
  <text start="641.019" dur="4.471">so of course not a surprise you know</text>
  <text start="643.779" dur="3.091">police often use technologies that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="645.49" dur="1.64">work all that well and then they just</text>
  <text start="646.87" dur="1.67">sort</text>
  <text start="647.13" dur="2.49">hit you with it anyway they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="648.54" dur="4.47">make it easier for them they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="649.62" dur="5.73">necessarily care about the people that</text>
  <text start="653.01" dur="4.02">they often see is criminal until proven</text>
  <text start="655.35" dur="3.06">innocent that happens with police not</text>
  <text start="657.03" dur="3.09">all of them but that happens with police</text>
  <text start="658.41" dur="2.66">all the time to hammer everything looks</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="3.45">like a nail</text>
  <text start="661.07" dur="4.51">so this is a obviously a terrible</text>
  <text start="663.57" dur="4.11">terrible crime I mean how many people</text>
  <text start="665.58" dur="4.95">have been revoked on their rights or</text>
  <text start="667.68" dur="4.47">thrown in prison or their lives ruin the</text>
  <text start="670.53" dur="3.27">reputation ruined for being a drunk</text>
  <text start="672.15" dur="3.84">driver when they don&amp;#39;t even necessarily</text>
  <text start="673.8" dur="4.68">drink or maybe they weren&amp;#39;t drinking and</text>
  <text start="675.99" dur="7.05">driving or the machine cracked out that</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="6.75">day right we also have the NYPD top cop</text>
  <text start="683.04" dur="4.44">who sat on the Weiner email laptop</text>
  <text start="685.23" dur="4.2">evidence is going to resign how many</text>
  <text start="687.48" dur="4.41">police suicides have happened in the sky</text>
  <text start="689.43" dur="5.58">for the specifically among those police</text>
  <text start="691.89" dur="5.37">that saw this laptop right so the Weiner</text>
  <text start="695.01" dur="4.47">laptop had the insurance file Huma</text>
  <text start="697.26" dur="4.77">Abedin Hillary Clinton Weiner of course</text>
  <text start="699.48" dur="4.77">was sexting children and then Hillary</text>
  <text start="702.03" dur="4.47">Clinton and Huma Abedin allegedly were</text>
  <text start="704.25" dur="4.41">on that laptop in that insurance file</text>
  <text start="706.5" dur="4.32">with all sorts of s ap level programs</text>
  <text start="708.66" dur="3.3">not to mention all of the evil things</text>
  <text start="710.82" dur="2.97">that they may have been doing for</text>
  <text start="711.96" dur="3.99">blackmail with each other there is even</text>
  <text start="713.79" dur="4.2">the rumor that whom Abbott in a Hillary</text>
  <text start="715.95" dur="3.9">Clinton made this sort of evil dark web</text>
  <text start="717.99" dur="4.44">video that that made it out to the dark</text>
  <text start="719.85" dur="4.65">web that Hillary and Huma used power</text>
  <text start="722.43" dur="4.59">tools to after raping a child to then</text>
  <text start="724.5" dur="4.32">rip off her face that&amp;#39;s pretty horrible</text>
  <text start="727.02" dur="4.23">horrifying and and this is not a</text>
  <text start="728.82" dur="4.14">Halloween show in fact a lot of people</text>
  <text start="731.25" dur="4.26">thought that was just a rumor and that</text>
  <text start="732.96" dur="4.47">it was crazy but it seems more and more</text>
  <text start="735.51" dur="3.54">likely even Hillary herself recently</text>
  <text start="737.43" dur="4.86">came out and started to talk about this</text>
  <text start="739.05" dur="5.19">video what I can&amp;#39;t even believe that she</text>
  <text start="742.29" dur="4.05">started to discuss this video in fact</text>
  <text start="744.24" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m actually leaning toward it being</text>
  <text start="746.34" dur="3.24">more real than ever now</text>
  <text start="747.63" dur="3.51">it&amp;#39;s called frazzled rib for those who</text>
  <text start="749.58" dur="2.37">haven&amp;#39;t heard of it don&amp;#39;t try to find it</text>
  <text start="751.14" dur="2.76">you know I&amp;#39;m gonna find it on the</text>
  <text start="751.95" dur="4.26">internet it&amp;#39;s illegal to watch it child</text>
  <text start="753.9" dur="7.77">porn if it&amp;#39;s true and it&amp;#39;s torture it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="756.21" dur="7.86">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a snuff film if it&amp;#39;s true but</text>
  <text start="761.67" dur="3.87">you know since I started the stop bit</text>
  <text start="764.07" dur="2.82">burning movement and started to talk</text>
  <text start="765.54" dur="3.51">about actually before I started it</text>
  <text start="766.89" dur="4.17">started to talk about censorship and</text>
  <text start="769.05" dur="4.38">maybe suing big tech I got all those</text>
  <text start="771.06" dur="4.65">creepy phone calls on my phone 100 calls</text>
  <text start="773.43" dur="4.14">per minute with screams supposedly this</text>
  <text start="775.71" dur="3.109">was told to me later those screams were</text>
  <text start="777.57" dur="3.829">from frazzled rep</text>
  <text start="778.819" dur="4.531">and attempt to threaten or intimidate my</text>
  <text start="781.399" dur="5.1">family for going after big tech</text>
  <text start="783.35" dur="5.31">censorship but if the video is real and</text>
  <text start="786.499" dur="3.51">maybe it is because Hilary&amp;#39;s addressing</text>
  <text start="788.66" dur="2.549">and she&amp;#39;s obviously afraid of it you</text>
  <text start="790.009" dur="4.711">attacked that which you fear the most</text>
  <text start="791.209" dur="5.52">asked you says if it&amp;#39;s real and these</text>
  <text start="794.72" dur="6.089">flashing dark web videos that she talks</text>
  <text start="796.729" dur="5.64">about that cost her the election it</text>
  <text start="800.809" dur="5.101">would possibly have been on this laptop</text>
  <text start="802.369" dur="5.791">and those police that were those NYPD</text>
  <text start="805.91" dur="6.75">officers that suicided supposedly</text>
  <text start="808.16" dur="7.589">mysteriously well they may have just</text>
  <text start="812.66" dur="6">been taken out to cover this up but now</text>
  <text start="815.749" dur="5.01">that we have this guy stepping down NYPD</text>
  <text start="818.66" dur="3.75">Commissioner James O&amp;#39;Neill expected to</text>
  <text start="820.759" dur="4.23">resign a specific position as soon as</text>
  <text start="822.41" dur="4.049">Monday well maybe we&amp;#39;ll have hope that</text>
  <text start="824.989" dur="3.08">those videos will come out remember</text>
  <text start="826.459" dur="4.53">there were threats to release them if</text>
  <text start="828.069" dur="4.48">justice wasn&amp;#39;t pursued so maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.989" dur="3.3">who they were killing maybe they were</text>
  <text start="832.549" dur="5.16">killing the rank-and-file officers that</text>
  <text start="834.289" dur="5.431">knew about this and would want to go and</text>
  <text start="837.709" dur="4.65">do something about it they want to go</text>
  <text start="839.72" dur="4.169">and you know see that justice was served</text>
  <text start="842.359" dur="4.68">that the truth came out because it was</text>
  <text start="843.889" dur="4.831">so horrendous those officers and we</text>
  <text start="847.039" dur="3.2">heard this anecdotally but you know</text>
  <text start="848.72" dur="5.099">secondhand but those officers were</text>
  <text start="850.239" dur="7.09">puking seeking counseling a grown man</text>
  <text start="853.819" dur="5.01">who could not watch this video if it</text>
  <text start="857.329" dur="4.771">through if it&amp;#39;s real I couldn&amp;#39;t watch it</text>
  <text start="858.829" dur="5.91">I would bawl like a child for the first</text>
  <text start="862.1" dur="7.319">time in 18 years the u.s. didn&amp;#39;t admit a</text>
  <text start="864.739" dur="7.47">refugee for an entire month the mass</text>
  <text start="869.419" dur="4.62">migratory mobs were incited and egged on</text>
  <text start="872.209" dur="5.73">by the media in an effort to sabotage</text>
  <text start="874.039" dur="6.27">the Trump presidency I love it now the</text>
  <text start="877.939" dur="3.48">last but not least here I want to talk</text>

  <text start="912.44" dur="4.14">get involved do the job quickly and</text>
  <text start="914.66" dur="4.32">effectively the great new President of</text>
  <text start="916.58" dur="3.87">Mexico has made this a big issue but the</text>
  <text start="918.98" dur="3.66">cartels have become so large and</text>
  <text start="920.45" dur="5.76">powerful that sometimes you need an army</text>
  <text start="922.64" dur="6.45">to defeat an army Wow</text>
  <text start="926.21" dur="4.5">in that powerful I mean President Trump</text>
  <text start="929.09" dur="3.39">is really threatening to go in there</text>

  <text start="947.24" dur="6.48">beat the Marines beat the army beat the</text>
  <text start="950.09" dur="6.3">Navy so I really would this would be a</text>
  <text start="953.72" dur="5.28">such a powerful shift not only for us</text>
  <text start="956.39" dur="4.14">but for Mexico for South America to send</text>
  <text start="959" dur="3.33">a message to the world to stop the</text>
  <text start="960.53" dur="3.12">fentanyl and the heroin and the drugs</text>
  <text start="962.33" dur="3.27">that are pouring into our country the</text>

  <text start="995.45" dur="3.8">I feel some responsibility for that but</text>
  <text start="1000.39" dur="4.98">maybe they wouldn&amp;#39;t have ended up that</text>
  <text start="1002.35" dur="4.77">way if we had a president Trump sooner</text>
