  <text start="236.69" dur="3.93">virtual book tour where I did some</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="3.06">interviews with the different authors in</text>
  <text start="240.62" dur="3.81">the queue book and kind of their</text>
  <text start="242.24" dur="3.78">personal stories as to why they were</text>
  <text start="244.43" dur="4.47">involved in the queue book and their</text>
  <text start="246.02" dur="6.21">motivations that&amp;#39;s gonna launch on the</text>
  <text start="248.9" dur="4.92">17th and now now of course it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="3.27">prevalent than ever because we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="253.82" dur="5.85">being censored and the queue movement is</text>
  <text start="255.5" dur="6.51">on the verge of going mainstream the</text>
  <text start="259.67" dur="4.05">great awakening you know the book is</text>
  <text start="262.01" dur="4.17">called an invitation to the Great</text>
  <text start="263.72" dur="5.58">Awakening and it&amp;#39;s relevant now more</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="4.98">than ever because with our making the</text>
  <text start="269.3" dur="3.48">statements he&amp;#39;s making and and the</text>
  <text start="271.16" dur="5.07">investigations kind of coming to a close</text>
  <text start="272.78" dur="5.07">you can see that but anyway it&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="276.23" dur="4.38">of fun to keep seeing them get triggered</text>
  <text start="277.85" dur="4.62">over it and we&amp;#39;ll talk about that too</text>
  <text start="280.61" dur="4.95">tonight I will talk about the queue</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="6.66">stuff it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just fun to have these</text>
  <text start="285.56" dur="7.02">these little I don&amp;#39;t know what you would</text>
  <text start="289.13" dur="5.34">call it it&amp;#39;s not exactly a trophy cuz</text>
  <text start="292.58" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s a video but it&amp;#39;s kind of like a</text>
  <text start="294.47" dur="5.25">trophy when you have Alex Jones doing</text>
  <text start="297.2" dur="4.8">stuff like that I don&amp;#39;t know what do you</text>
  <text start="299.72" dur="4.77">guys think</text>
  <text start="302" dur="5.49">frozen Marauder says why can we not</text>
  <text start="304.49" dur="5.88">super chat you Dustin so there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="307.49" dur="5.37">reasons one I am not eligible for</text>
  <text start="310.37" dur="5.4">monetization because I am censored as</text>
  <text start="312.86" dur="4.74">all heck too</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="3.66">even when I was eligible for</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="4.29">monetization but everything was turned</text>
  <text start="319.43" dur="5.37">off immediately I still didn&amp;#39;t apply for</text>
  <text start="321.89" dur="5.31">super chat because they take about 40%</text>
  <text start="324.8" dur="4.56">and frankly I felt dishonest and</text>
  <text start="327.2" dur="4.86">unethical taking money through that</text>
  <text start="329.36" dur="5.82">because I don&amp;#39;t make much as it is and</text>
  <text start="332.06" dur="5.52">to give them 40 percent of it or you</text>
  <text start="335.18" dur="4.98">know I know that people reach deep</text>
  <text start="337.58" dur="3.72">sometimes to help out the channel and I</text>
  <text start="340.16" dur="3.45">just felt like it was a waste</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="4.62">I would rather you keep it then give</text>
  <text start="343.61" dur="3.99">them 40 percent of it if you do want to</text>
  <text start="345.92" dur="3.72">help and you&amp;#39;re willing to take an extra</text>
  <text start="347.6" dur="7.609">like two clicks of effort you can go to</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="9.059">donor box.org slash Dustin Nemo&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.209" dur="4.901">Kalli coca I I&amp;#39;m not high if I look high</text>
  <text start="358.699" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;ve just got red eyes from</text>
  <text start="360.11" dur="5.609">staring at this screen all day every day</text>
  <text start="362.179" dur="6.99">and back problems from it too it seems</text>
  <text start="365.719" dur="7.98">like I did get run over so that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="6.45">probably worth about four I&amp;#39;m sorry no I</text>
  <text start="373.699" dur="3.75">also I have this screen in front of me</text>
  <text start="375.619" dur="5.22">and then I have another screen to my</text>
  <text start="377.449" dur="3.69">left as well so I probably look high all</text>
  <text start="380.839" dur="2.88">the time</text>
  <text start="381.139" dur="4.77">in fact you can sometimes like this eye</text>
  <text start="383.719" dur="5.28">is really red and this eye is really</text>
  <text start="385.909" dur="7.53">white so you can you can kind of see</text>
  <text start="388.999" dur="9.42">that I&amp;#39;m not did secret space programs</text>
  <text start="393.439" dur="8.79">declassify no the the secret space stuff</text>
  <text start="398.419" dur="6.24">is is not my area of expertise a lot of</text>
  <text start="402.229" dur="6.42">that has disinfo mixed and so much of</text>
  <text start="404.659" dur="5.85">that is disinfo remember the the ancient</text>
  <text start="408.649" dur="4.95">alien show you know they had some sort</text>
  <text start="410.509" dur="5.91">of satanic folks and involved at some</text>
  <text start="413.599" dur="5.28">level I think David Wilcock left them</text>

  <text start="418.879" dur="2.79">and Hillary or some of the biggest</text>
  <text start="420.019" dur="4.02">proponents of the disclosure movement</text>
  <text start="421.669" dur="4.08">right so there is a element of that that</text>
  <text start="424.039" dur="4.261">is meant to deceive and meant to</text>
  <text start="425.749" dur="6.09">distract and meant to confuse so I kind</text>
  <text start="428.3" dur="6.089">of stay away from from most of the alien</text>

  <text start="1464.71" dur="5.089">that because at least as I understand</text>
  <text start="1467.619" dur="5.88">that clones wouldn&amp;#39;t have a memory and</text>
  <text start="1469.799" dur="6.791">there would be a lot of markers for that</text>
  <text start="1473.499" dur="6.78">and you would also have to I think grow</text>

  <text start="4306.949" dur="3.801">of you may remember that the Dark</text>
  <text start="4308.179" dur="5.641">Crystal movie for example then the movie</text>

  <text start="4326.63" dur="5.31">monsters so like if you&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="4329.679" dur="4.331">any kind of entertainment it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="4331.94" dur="5.37">hard to get that because it&amp;#39;s all just</text>
  <text start="4334.01" dur="5.52">filled with symbolism recently one</text>
  <text start="4337.31" dur="4.95">example being the show stranger things</text>

  <text start="4448.34" dur="3.51">just a few of us it&amp;#39;ll be many of us and</text>
  <text start="4450.29" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;ll be like walk away kind of</text>
  <text start="4451.85" dur="3.99">movement where people are sharing their</text>
  <text start="4454.19" dur="6.33">own videos of being censored and bit</text>

  <text start="4469.64" dur="6.45">earlier this year and we had to sort of</text>
  <text start="4472.75" dur="5.89">freeze the growth there and and and even</text>
  <text start="4476.09" dur="6.36">scale back in some areas just to be able</text>
  <text start="4478.64" dur="7.2">to continue and then of course what</text>
