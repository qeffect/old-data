  <text start="141.04" dur="6.69">here in the states as well and yeah it</text>
  <text start="145.3" dur="4.62">does not surprise me that there would be</text>
  <text start="147.73" dur="6.119">a central ring there in Arkansas</text>
  <text start="149.92" dur="6.42">especially since that is very heavily</text>
  <text start="153.849" dur="4.851">connected to the Clintons Bill Clinton</text>
  <text start="156.34" dur="6.78">was actually governor there for a while</text>

  <text start="186.519" dur="2.731">information to release but we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="187.989" dur="3.511">process of verifying the information</text>
  <text start="189.25" dur="4.23">first and check back further</text>
  <text start="191.5" dur="9.389">developments we will be definitely doing</text>
  <text start="193.48" dur="13.319">that okay so this one here is from 2017</text>
  <text start="200.889" dur="8.641">and this is talking about what was going</text>
  <text start="206.799" dur="4.231">on at a summit where there were</text>
  <text start="209.53" dur="3.66">different lawmakers and different people</text>
  <text start="211.03" dur="4.35">who were brought together to talk about</text>
  <text start="213.19" dur="5.519">human trafficking and it came to</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="5.43">Arkansas so let&amp;#39;s look at this so says</text>
  <text start="218.709" dur="4.471">the National Foundation for women</text>
  <text start="220.81" dur="3.72">legislators was honored to have elected</text>

  <text start="243.549" dur="2.461">a day and a half</text>
  <text start="244.45" dur="3.93">long discussion on one of the most</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="4.77">critical issues in America today child</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="4.8">sex trafficking the legislature</text>
  <text start="250.78" dur="4.62">attendees were specifically selected due</text>
  <text start="253.18" dur="3.6">to their roles as champions of human</text>
  <text start="255.4" dur="2.1">trafficking legislation in their</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="3.06">communities</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="3.9">and ability to advance the fight against</text>
  <text start="259.84" dur="4.98">trafficking with further knowledge and</text>
  <text start="261.4" dur="6.54">support provided by the summit so</text>
  <text start="264.82" dur="7.26">this summit here brought together some</text>
  <text start="267.94" dur="6.42">of the most influential people who were</text>
  <text start="272.08" dur="6.09">involved in the investigation of child</text>
  <text start="274.36" dur="6.99">sex trafficking right and so Arkansas</text>
  <text start="278.17" dur="5.73">state senator at the time Linda Collins</text>
  <text start="281.35" dur="5.04">Smith was also invited to this summit</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="5.19">why because she was heavily involved in</text>
  <text start="286.39" dur="5.49">work against child sex trafficking so</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="6.99">this just goes for the show you know</text>
  <text start="291.88" dur="6.39">that okay so another thing that she was</text>
  <text start="296.08" dur="5.78">involved in apparently was she was</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="7.8">looking into there were discrepancies in</text>
  <text start="301.86" dur="6.03">funding for Medicaid through the</text>
  <text start="306.07" dur="5.88">Department of Child Protective Services</text>
  <text start="307.89" dur="7.66">so apparently there was a total of 124</text>
  <text start="311.95" dur="8.16">million dollars excuse me 126 million</text>
  <text start="315.55" dur="6.93">dollars and so they were looking at why</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="5.25">there were so much discrepancies in the</text>
  <text start="322.48" dur="5.85">books and apparently also there was even</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="5.46">two separate books so there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="4.5">really shady stuff going on with this</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="5.31">type of funding so this one is from</text>
  <text start="332.83" dur="5.28">Arkansas online.com says DHS to address</text>
  <text start="336.13" dur="3.63">cost discrepancies work with auditors</text>
  <text start="338.11" dur="3.96">the State Department of Human Services</text>
  <text start="339.76" dur="4.29">will create a unit to work with outside</text>
  <text start="342.07" dur="3.87">auditors and address any problems they</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="4.14">discover the department&amp;#39;s director told</text>
  <text start="345.94" dur="4.14">lawmakers on Monday at a meeting of the</text>

  <text start="354.58" dur="3.51">apologized for not attending the panels</text>
  <text start="356.2" dur="3.72">last meeting in July in which other</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="4.05">department officials briefed lawmakers</text>
  <text start="359.92" dur="4.23">on the Department&amp;#39;s response to an audit</text>
  <text start="362.14" dur="4.71">that flagged reporting errors and other</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="7.02">discrepancies related to 126 million in</text>
  <text start="366.85" dur="5.91">expenses quote if you come to these</text>
  <text start="371.17" dur="3.69">meetings I think you can learn a lot</text>
  <text start="372.76" dur="5.07">from them from them in quote senator</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="4.5">Linda Collin Smith from Pocahontas and a</text>
  <text start="377.83" dur="3.93">vice chairman of the subcommittee said</text>
  <text start="379.36" dur="4.2">on Monday the discrepancies were</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="4.23">discovered are an annual review by</text>
  <text start="383.56" dur="4.8">legislative auditors programs receiving</text>
  <text start="385.99" dur="4.53">federal money the bulk of the questioned</text>
  <text start="388.36" dur="3.63">costs resulted from reports to the</text>
  <text start="390.52" dur="2.79">federal government showing Medicaid</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="3.24">spending amounts that didn&amp;#39;t match</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="4.29">information in the department&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="395.23" dur="3.34">financial management system the audit</text>
  <text start="397.6" dur="2.5">also been on</text>
  <text start="398.57" dur="3.87">almost twenty-eight million the state</text>
  <text start="400.1" dur="4.08">could owe to the federal government</text>
  <text start="402.44" dur="3.54">because of expenses lacking proper</text>
  <text start="404.18" dur="5.52">documentation or shouldn&amp;#39;t have been</text>
  <text start="405.98" dur="5.61">allowed under federal rules jal SP said</text>
  <text start="409.7" dur="3.99">the amount owed will come substantially</text>
  <text start="411.59" dur="6.39">down after the department supplies they</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="6.36">need a documentation and really I think</text>
  <text start="417.98" dur="5.82">that they&amp;#39;re gonna find a lot more is</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="7.14">there then related to that is this tweet</text>
  <text start="423.8" dur="5.7">from Southern belt and it asks whether</text>
  <text start="427.19" dur="4.71">or not this was in Arkansas is Arkansas</text>
  <text start="429.5" dur="5.13">Senator Linda Colin Smith asking about</text>
  <text start="431.9" dur="5.13">27 million missing from Arkansas DHS</text>
  <text start="434.63" dur="4.86">Child Protective Services she was</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="4.71">working with DHS insider to expose the</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="4.56">missing 27 million from DHS Child</text>
  <text start="441.74" dur="4.38">Protective Services these funds are</text>
  <text start="444.05" dur="4.02">being placed into trade and the</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="4.41">dividends are being filtered back to the</text>
  <text start="448.07" dur="4.65">Clinton Foundation or owned shell</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="4.92">companies belonging to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="5.82">Foundation the missing 27 million was</text>
  <text start="455.45" dur="5.22">discovered when was revealed that DHS in</text>
  <text start="458.54" dur="5.07">Arkansas had two separate sets of books</text>
  <text start="460.67" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s connected to a federal grant that</text>
  <text start="463.61" dur="4.44">requires a specific number of children</text>
  <text start="465.8" dur="4.35">be removed from their families to meet</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="6.21">the required quota so that they&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="470.15" dur="7.11">to renew the grant each year so this</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="4.98">also could be related to the child</text>
  <text start="477.26" dur="5.22">trafficking that was going on too so</text>
  <text start="479.24" dur="5.76">there is a certain number of children</text>
  <text start="482.48" dur="4.35">that needs to be removed then what</text>
  <text start="485" dur="3.96">happens to those children and I know</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="4.85">we&amp;#39;ve talked about before where you know</text>
  <text start="488.96" dur="7.97">foster children are particularly</text>
  <text start="491.68" dur="10.39">vulnerable to being trafficked right so</text>
  <text start="496.93" dur="7.09">this could be related where we have all</text>
  <text start="502.07" dur="4.32">of this money that&amp;#39;s being funneled back</text>
  <text start="504.02" dur="4.35">into the Clinton Foundation and this</text>
  <text start="506.39" dur="5.22">money is given through grants that are</text>
  <text start="508.37" dur="5.67">related to children who are removed from</text>
  <text start="511.61" dur="6.39">the homes and then those children then</text>
  <text start="514.04" dur="5.879">are trafficked so I think there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="518" dur="6.11">to this and it&amp;#39;s very possible that</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="7.671">Linda Collins had lost her life over it</text>
  <text start="524.11" dur="6.34">all right then also we have a second</text>
  <text start="527.59" dur="4.27">sent former senator who was also found</text>
  <text start="530.45" dur="3.6">at this is the one that was mentioned in</text>
  <text start="531.86" dur="3.39">the first article that I read where they</text>
  <text start="534.05" dur="3.24">were saying that these two are</text>
  <text start="535.25" dur="4.14">supposedly related so we&amp;#39;re gonna look</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="4.77">more into that and then I&amp;#39;ll make a</text>
  <text start="539.39" dur="3.33">feature video about that so this is from</text>
  <text start="542.06" dur="2.61">Fox News</text>

  <text start="618.79" dur="9.76">that happened was actually an inside job</text>
  <text start="623.66" dur="6.75">because there were files in that</text>
  <text start="628.55" dur="5.6">building that were related to Bill</text>

  <text start="634.15" dur="5.98">during iran-contra and that they those</text>
  <text start="638.15" dur="3.51">files had to be destroyed and this</text>
  <text start="640.13" dur="4.71">happened right after he became president</text>
  <text start="641.66" dur="5.31">so of course he needed to get rid of any</text>

  <text start="695.42" dur="3.9">in the neighborhood where he worked the</text>
  <text start="697.22" dur="4.38">other was a longtime homicide detective</text>
  <text start="699.32" dur="3.99">discovered lifeless hours later in the</text>
  <text start="701.6" dur="4.17">dark marshlands of southern Brooklyn</text>
  <text start="703.31" dur="4.26">both men had killed themselves startling</text>
  <text start="705.77" dur="3.81">back-to-back suicides that prompted</text>
  <text start="707.57" dur="4.53">senior police officials to make direct</text>

  <text start="719" dur="3.21">the two men who died Wednesday and</text>
  <text start="720.5" dur="3.78">Thursday had combined experience of</text>
  <text start="722.21" dur="4.11">almost 80 years and had seen other</text>
  <text start="724.28" dur="4.38">officers take their lives before finally</text>
  <text start="726.32" dur="4.95">taking the same route on Wednesday the</text>
  <text start="728.66" dur="4.83">body of Deputy Chief Steven J Selke 62</text>
  <text start="731.27" dur="4.41">was found shortly before sunset near</text>
  <text start="733.49" dur="4.29">Forest Hill stadium and the precinct</text>

  <text start="737.78" dur="5.28">from a self-inflicted gunshot wound</text>
  <text start="739.84" dur="5.17">the police said stunned by the death of</text>
  <text start="743.06" dur="4.26">the popular chief the department found</text>
  <text start="745.01" dur="4.8">itself the next day scrambling to find a</text>
  <text start="747.32" dur="5.7">missing detective Joseph Calabrese 58</text>
  <text start="749.81" dur="5.85">after his empty vehicle was found beside</text>
  <text start="753.02" dur="4.95">the Belt Parkway near a beach a massive</text>
  <text start="755.66" dur="4.56">search was launched by air and sea with</text>
  <text start="757.97" dur="4.74">helicopters divers in about 100 officers</text>
  <text start="760.22" dur="6.89">before the detectives body was found on</text>
  <text start="762.71" dur="6.9">Thursday afternoon near Palm Beach so</text>
  <text start="767.11" dur="4.96">the other thing I want to say about this</text>
  <text start="769.61" dur="5.31">too is that just because they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="772.07" dur="9.78">that this is a suicide doesn&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="774.92" dur="10.18">is because for one thing it&amp;#39;s highly</text>
  <text start="781.85" dur="5.17">coincidental that these two officers</text>
  <text start="785.1" dur="5.07">committed suicide within such a short</text>
  <text start="787.02" dur="5.78">timeframe and also that that time frame</text>
  <text start="790.17" dur="6.18">was within the same time frame that</text>
  <text start="792.8" dur="6.4">these two former lawmakers were also</text>
  <text start="796.35" dur="4.68">killed right so it doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="799.2" dur="6.63">sense and especially being that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="801.03" dur="9.81">NYPD and we know that when it comes to</text>
  <text start="805.83" dur="7.62">the NYPD they are linked to some pretty</text>
  <text start="810.84" dur="5.04">significant cases one that comes to my</text>
  <text start="813.45" dur="7.44">mind right now is the Weiner laptop</text>
  <text start="815.88" dur="7.29">right so this I think is not what they</text>
  <text start="820.89" dur="6.45">want you to think it is and it really</text>
  <text start="823.17" dur="7.49">makes me think of Vince Foster Vince</text>
  <text start="827.34" dur="5.7">Foster if you remember correctly he was</text>
  <text start="830.66" dur="5.11">murdered well he they said he committed</text>
  <text start="833.04" dur="6.87">suicide right around whitewater scandal</text>
  <text start="835.77" dur="5.79">right which whitewater isn&amp;#39;t what they</text>
  <text start="839.91" dur="4.17">want you to think a lot of people think</text>
  <text start="841.56" dur="4.56">that whitewater what had a lot to do</text>
  <text start="844.08" dur="4.05">with you know the cannon star report and</text>
  <text start="846.12" dur="3.99">Monica Lewinsky but that&amp;#39;s not what it</text>
  <text start="848.13" dur="4.89">was at all there&amp;#39;s so much more to it</text>
  <text start="850.11" dur="4.77">and I&amp;#39;m actually going to be talking</text>
  <text start="853.02" dur="6.12">about that at a later time but anyway</text>
  <text start="854.88" dur="8.75">Vince Foster was found dead and they</text>
  <text start="859.14" dur="9.03">called it a suicide but when you look at</text>
  <text start="863.63" dur="9.12">the scene it was not it was not a</text>
  <text start="868.17" dur="7.74">suicide at all I mean he he was</text>
  <text start="872.75" dur="5.44">carefully and perfectly laid down and in</text>
  <text start="875.91" dur="4.26">such a way where there was no way that</text>
  <text start="878.19" dur="3.39">he could have killed himself and fall</text>
  <text start="880.17" dur="4.14">down like that it doesn&amp;#39;t happen like</text>
  <text start="881.58" dur="4.62">that you know there was very little</text>
  <text start="884.31" dur="3.3">blood on the scene whereas you know if</text>
  <text start="886.2" dur="4.05">somebody shoots themselves in the head</text>
  <text start="887.61" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a very messy ordeal but it</text>
  <text start="890.25" dur="4.29">wasn&amp;#39;t there was a lot of different</text>
  <text start="892.26" dur="5.31">things and if you look at old interviews</text>
  <text start="894.54" dur="5.91">about that with different detectives who</text>
  <text start="897.57" dur="5.16">were asked about this they will tell you</text>
  <text start="900.45" dur="4.74">that it was not it was not a suicide but</text>
  <text start="902.73" dur="6.42">in the end they called it a suicide</text>
  <text start="905.19" dur="6.96">why because they wanted to cover up why</text>
  <text start="909.15" dur="5.28">this person was murdered so it seems to</text>
  <text start="912.15" dur="4.35">me that these veteran officers</text>
  <text start="914.43" dur="3.16">especially since they&amp;#39;re veterans right</text>
  <text start="916.5" dur="4.66">they&amp;#39;ve been in</text>
  <text start="917.59" dur="6.51">um this position for a long time so they</text>
  <text start="921.16" dur="5.4">seen a lot right so who knows what kind</text>
  <text start="924.1" dur="4.86">of information they had so there are a</text>
  <text start="926.56" dur="5.04">lot of potential reasons for them to be</text>
  <text start="928.96" dur="4.86">killed and not just suicide so you know</text>
  <text start="931.6" dur="4.08">I think we should be looking into this a</text>
  <text start="933.82" dur="5.67">little bit further and not just take</text>
  <text start="935.68" dur="7.71">this at face value all right the last</text>
  <text start="939.49" dur="8.85">thing here actually no I got Tony still</text>
  <text start="943.39" dur="9.18">to talk about but anyway so then we have</text>
  <text start="948.34" dur="6.69">this mayor and another convicted New</text>
  <text start="952.57" dur="5.1">Jersey police officer who were missing</text>
  <text start="955.03" dur="5.22">in Vermont so that&amp;#39;s kind of interesting</text>
  <text start="957.67" dur="5.16">and this is all happening at the same</text>
  <text start="960.25" dur="4.32">time mind you so says Vermont State</text>

  <text start="1003.24" dur="4.2">investigation into his appearance into</text>
  <text start="1005.73" dur="4.5">his disappearance is continuing our</text>
  <text start="1007.44" dur="4.47">investigation remains ongoing but we do</text>
  <text start="1010.23" dur="3.69">not have any further water searchers</text>
  <text start="1011.91" dur="5.7">plan unless we have we developed new</text>
  <text start="1013.92" dur="6.81">evidence Brady was a Spartan councilman</text>
  <text start="1017.61" dur="6.51">from 2006 to 2010 and Mayor of the</text>
  <text start="1020.73" dur="4.92">Sussex County town from 2008 to 2009 he</text>

  <text start="1036.84" dur="7.98">right now we have this they are missing</text>
  <text start="1039.66" dur="6.93">right now so all this you know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1044.82" dur="3.66">a coincidence that this is happening and</text>
  <text start="1046.59" dur="3.04">of course you know we were told before</text>
  <text start="1048.48" dur="4.8">that</text>
  <text start="1049.63" dur="5.88">there would be a suicide and death watch</text>
  <text start="1053.28" dur="4.84">all right the last thing I want to talk</text>
  <text start="1055.51" dur="7.68">about here is Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s brother</text>
  <text start="1058.12" dur="6.72">Tony rot him his dead now says Hillary</text>
  <text start="1063.19" dur="4.83">Clinton&amp;#39;s youngest brother Tony Rodham</text>
  <text start="1064.84" dur="4.65">died on Friday night quote it&amp;#39;s hard to</text>
  <text start="1068.02" dur="3.42">find words my mind is flooded with</text>
  <text start="1069.49" dur="3.39">memories of him today when he walked</text>
  <text start="1071.44" dur="4.62">into a room he&amp;#39;d lighted up with</text>
  <text start="1072.88" dur="5.1">laughter Clinton tweeted on Saturday he</text>
  <text start="1076.06" dur="4.68">was kind generous and wonderful husband</text>
  <text start="1077.98" dur="4.8">Megan and father to Zack Simon and Fiona</text>
  <text start="1080.74" dur="4.26">will miss him very much the cause of</text>
  <text start="1082.78" dur="4.08">death was not immediately known I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1085" dur="5.31">pretty sure they&amp;#39;re probably just trying</text>
  <text start="1086.86" dur="5.67">to figure out what kind of cause they</text>
  <text start="1090.31" dur="4.49">can label him with you know to where</text>
  <text start="1092.53" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s going to make the story sound good</text>
  <text start="1094.8" dur="3.01">since they don&amp;#39;t know that yet then</text>
  <text start="1096.88" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re just going to tell you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1097.81" dur="6.36">unidentified Rodham born in 1954 was a</text>
  <text start="1102.16" dur="4.41">businessman who worked for the DNC in</text>
  <text start="1104.17" dur="4.86">1992 during his brother-in-law&amp;#39;s first</text>
  <text start="1106.57" dur="3.81">presidential campaign he was involved in</text>
  <text start="1109.03" dur="3.45">several scandals over the next three</text>
  <text start="1110.38" dur="5.52">decades as he reportedly tried to parlay</text>
  <text start="1112.48" dur="5.19">his sister status personal gain in 2015</text>
  <text start="1115.9" dur="3.72">the Department of Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="1117.67" dur="4.17">exposed his efforts to wheedle visa</text>
  <text start="1119.62" dur="3.72">approvals from the agency while Hillary</text>
  <text start="1121.84" dur="6.9">Clinton was Secretary of State under</text>
  <text start="1123.34" dur="10.68">then President Barack Obama now I do</text>
  <text start="1128.74" dur="7.26">want to say that&amp;#39;s when it comes to</text>
  <text start="1134.02" dur="4.46">these pieces they&amp;#39;re talking about those</text>
  <text start="1136" dur="6.29">visas were handed over to the Chinese</text>
  <text start="1138.48" dur="9.43">right and so they&amp;#39;re gonna blame it on</text>
  <text start="1142.29" dur="9.85">Tony but I think that Tony was probably</text>
  <text start="1147.91" dur="7.5">a do boy all right so the Clintons were</text>
  <text start="1152.14" dur="5.13">selling us out to China for years for a</text>
  <text start="1155.41" dur="4.29">long time and a lot of people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1157.27" dur="4.98">remember when Bill Clinton during his</text>
  <text start="1159.7" dur="4.8">presidency he sold our military</text>
  <text start="1162.25" dur="4.14">technology to China that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1164.5" dur="3.69">sailing around with a rail gun uh-huh</text>
  <text start="1166.39" dur="3.87">you know I&amp;#39;m one of their naval ships</text>
  <text start="1168.19" dur="4.05">right now they got that from us because</text>
  <text start="1170.26" dur="4.26">Bill Clinton had sold it to them and of</text>
  <text start="1172.24" dur="5.79">course you know more recently we had it</text>
  <text start="1174.52" dur="6.48">where you know Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s server</text>
  <text start="1178.03" dur="5.57">was hacked apparently by the Chinese but</text>
  <text start="1181" dur="5.57">that wasn&amp;#39;t the case her server</text>
  <text start="1183.6" dur="6.66">never has she sold that information to</text>
  <text start="1186.57" dur="6.599">China so her and Bill Clinton and Tony</text>
  <text start="1190.26" dur="4.799">rata have been selling us to China for</text>
  <text start="1193.169" dur="5.671">decades and that&amp;#39;s what the real story</text>
  <text start="1195.059" dur="6.781">is here but anyway I have no doubt in my</text>
  <text start="1198.84" dur="5.16">mind that Tony rotten had a lot of dirt</text>
  <text start="1201.84" dur="4.32">on them and he knew a lot of information</text>
  <text start="1204" dur="4.169">and they probably knew that if they ever</text>
  <text start="1206.16" dur="5.22">caught up to him he was going to fold</text>
  <text start="1208.169" dur="5.791">just like Vince Foster Vince Foster was</text>
  <text start="1211.38" dur="4.98">very close with the Clintons very close</text>
  <text start="1213.96" dur="5.52">I mean Bill Clinton grew up next to this</text>
  <text start="1216.36" dur="6.09">guy so he was more than just someone who</text>
  <text start="1219.48" dur="5.85">was on their team he was a friend a very</text>
  <text start="1222.45" dur="5.64">close friend almost like a family member</text>
  <text start="1225.33" dur="5.579">but he knew too much and so that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="1228.09" dur="5.12">he was killed so same thing here with</text>
  <text start="1230.909" dur="6.091">Tony rotten</text>
  <text start="1233.21" dur="7.39">he was definitely disposed of at this</text>
  <text start="1237" dur="4.919">point because he is a liability and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1240.6" dur="3.42">sure all of these other people were</text>
  <text start="1241.919" dur="4.561">liabilities too and I think at this</text>
  <text start="1244.02" dur="5.82">point because of all of this we can</text>
  <text start="1246.48" dur="5.1">assume that they are closing in pretty</text>
  <text start="1249.84" dur="3.87">quickly right now on the Clintons</text>
  <text start="1251.58" dur="4.32">they&amp;#39;ve got to be because now we have</text>
  <text start="1253.71" dur="4.91">these people dropping like flies all</text>
  <text start="1255.9" dur="5.61">right well that&amp;#39;s all I have for today I</text>
