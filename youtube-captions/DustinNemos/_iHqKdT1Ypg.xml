  <text start="120.079" dur="5.161">that prior to getting to know you my</text>
  <text start="123.319" dur="4.021">work has generally been that of a</text>
  <text start="125.24" dur="4.049">litigation attorney primarily in</text>
  <text start="127.34" dur="5.01">business you know doing some work in the</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="6.331">area of defamation and you know just</text>
  <text start="132.35" dur="5.79">been actively practicing law for quite a</text>
  <text start="135.62" dur="4.86">long time enjoy doing it so I look</text>

  <text start="145.1" dur="3.96">appreciate your time so you know I want</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="3.27">to dive right in this is an issue that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.06" dur="3.33">close to my heart as close to</text>
  <text start="150.47" dur="3.75">everybody&amp;#39;s heart and that&amp;#39;s why I was</text>
  <text start="152.39" dur="3.27">really excited to speak with you behind</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="3.18">the scenes because I know that you know</text>
  <text start="155.66" dur="5.61">you actually do care about free speech</text>
  <text start="157.4" dur="7.68">as an issue where are we</text>
  <text start="161.27" dur="6.06">now as legalese can you break that down</text>
  <text start="165.08" dur="4.05">for for the common person to understand</text>
  <text start="167.33" dur="4.65">because it&amp;#39;s very complicated this this</text>
  <text start="169.13" dur="4.86">platform versus publisher versus free</text>
  <text start="171.98" dur="4.71">speech versus discrimination</text>
  <text start="173.99" dur="4.53">Cavanaugh&amp;#39;s recent you know or the</text>
  <text start="176.69" dur="5.16">Supreme Court I would say is recent you</text>
  <text start="178.52" dur="4.62">know decisions can you kind of help us</text>
  <text start="181.85" dur="5.88">to at least understand that as a late</text>
  <text start="183.14" dur="6">yeah yeah I&amp;#39;ll certainly try you know</text>
  <text start="187.73" dur="3.95">back and I don&amp;#39;t know the year in the</text>
  <text start="189.14" dur="5.55">night late 1990s the Congress passed the</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="7.3">Communications Decency Act and that act</text>
  <text start="194.69" dur="7.74">is created you know the ability for</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="6.75">computer platforms to avoid any</text>
  <text start="202.43" dur="5.64">liability for defamation and to kind of</text>
  <text start="205.73" dur="5.13">protect that that business model that</text>
  <text start="208.07" dur="4.53">exists for them and so they have the you</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="3.87">know they have the ability to regulate</text>
  <text start="212.6" dur="3.33">or they have the ability to a lot of</text>
  <text start="214.73" dur="3.3">people to publish something on their</text>
  <text start="215.93" dur="4.14">platform and then what&amp;#39;s published they</text>
  <text start="218.03" dur="5.04">can&amp;#39;t be held liable for whatever said</text>
  <text start="220.07" dur="6.95">there and you know that is a very</text>
  <text start="223.07" dur="6.69">powerful tool and in and it also gives</text>
  <text start="227.02" dur="6.91">social media platforms a lot of power so</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="7.62">social media platforms are able to you</text>
  <text start="233.93" dur="5.19">know determine what content are you know</text>
  <text start="237.38" dur="4.23">to determine who can use the platform</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="4.2">and generally they&amp;#39;re exempt from any</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="3.45">liability for that other than the</text>
  <text start="243.32" dur="3.51">liability that they permit for</text>
  <text start="245.06" dur="4.23">themselves so for example if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="246.83" dur="4.68">Twitter or YouTube they have Terms of</text>
  <text start="249.29" dur="4.47">Service and you agree to abide by those</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="6.75">Terms of Service of course they do too</text>
  <text start="253.76" dur="6.69">but you know if if you don&amp;#39;t have much</text>
  <text start="258.26" dur="6.18">recourse in other words you cannot say</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="6.12">hey you be monetized my channel and</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="3.45">you&amp;#39;ve cost me you know twenty thousand</text>
  <text start="266.57" dur="3.99">dollars a month or whatever it may be</text>
  <text start="267.89" dur="4.53">because you did so improperly so if you</text>
  <text start="270.56" dur="5.16">wanted to go after them you would say</text>
  <text start="272.42" dur="5.52">you&amp;#39;d be monetize my channel but your</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="4.65">damages are limited I think a dollar in</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="4.8">most cases are very limited so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="280.37" dur="4.26">not a lot that you can do now you know</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="3.39">this you asked about the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="284.63" dur="3.54">and so forth I mean obviously these are</text>
  <text start="286.13" dur="4.349">important issues there was a yeah</text>
  <text start="288.17" dur="4.8">everywhere yeah I mean there was an</text>
  <text start="290.479" dur="4.471">interesting article that some some of</text>
  <text start="292.97" dur="4.02">the Law Review people at Harvard</text>
  <text start="294.95" dur="5.46">school for example recently wrote said</text>
  <text start="296.99" dur="5.75">that that you know these platforms</text>
  <text start="300.41" dur="4.59">deserve First Amendment protections and</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="4.45">that came out you could google that and</text>
  <text start="305" dur="5.46">find it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s fairly approachable to</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="5.28">a non lawyer but you know they said for</text>
  <text start="310.46" dur="6.63">example Twitter deserves First Amendment</text>
  <text start="312.47" dur="7.17">protections but at the same time they</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="4.17">didn&amp;#39;t say that users should enjoy those</text>
  <text start="319.64" dur="4.95">First Amendment protections so people</text>
  <text start="321.26" dur="5.96">like you or anybody that tries to use</text>
  <text start="324.59" dur="6.21">the public forum of YouTube or Twitter</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="5.59">faces these these challenges and you</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="3.57">know the Supreme Court hasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="332.81" dur="3.72">fully addressed this there have been</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="4.05">some cases that kind of you know are</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="4.05">around the edges but what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="338.42" dur="4.53">determined in working for you is that</text>
  <text start="340.58" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s not a lot of developed case law</text>
  <text start="342.95" dur="3.36">so we&amp;#39;re looking for opportunities to</text>
  <text start="344.51" dur="6.03">develop that case law in a positive way</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="5.7">so that&amp;#39;s exciting so basically we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.54" dur="3.24">researching this where we&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="352.01" dur="4.89">into this where we&amp;#39;re diving this from</text>
  <text start="353.78" dur="5.04">from a serious standpoint and you know</text>
  <text start="356.9" dur="3.54">if this this kind of Google Project</text>
  <text start="358.82" dur="3.45">Veritas stuff I don&amp;#39;t know if that can</text>
  <text start="360.44" dur="3.6">help us or not but certainly I</text>
  <text start="362.27" dur="4.2">understand in the court of public</text>
  <text start="364.04" dur="6.21">opinion this looks really bad this looks</text>
  <text start="366.47" dur="6.66">really guilty and it looks you know</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="4.86">really embarrassing I would say as a</text>
  <text start="373.13" dur="3.42">corporation to have these kind of things</text>
  <text start="375.11" dur="3.66">out there what do you do you have an</text>
  <text start="376.55" dur="3.93">opinion if you can say no I think I</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="3.69">think that you know the issue is is</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="4.02">whether there a platform or publishers</text>
  <text start="382.46" dur="4.17">if their publisher they&amp;#39;re like anybody</text>
  <text start="384.5" dur="6.36">else you know they can be found liable</text>
  <text start="386.63" dur="7.04">for for censorship or for violating your</text>
  <text start="390.86" dur="5.4">rights to free speech or free expression</text>
  <text start="393.67" dur="4.3">and so that you know that&amp;#39;s that is a</text>
  <text start="396.26" dur="3.99">real serious issue so when you look at</text>
  <text start="397.97" dur="4.65">what say Project Veritas is done and</text>
  <text start="400.25" dur="4.56">bringing forth whistleblowers who say</text>
  <text start="402.62" dur="4.38">that we are in fact regulating content</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="5.79">then what happens is is that you could</text>
  <text start="407" dur="6.24">say well YouTube is is a publisher it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.6" dur="5.31">not a platform war or Twitter as a</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="5.34">publisher it&amp;#39;s not a platform and by</text>
  <text start="415.91" dur="5.13">doing that they may lose a lot of their</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="4.83">of their you know protections under the</text>
  <text start="421.04" dur="5.73">under the law so that would it make it</text>
  <text start="423.41" dur="4.52">more possible for you to I say you in</text>
  <text start="426.77" dur="3.739">general but for a purse</text>
  <text start="427.93" dur="4.23">to complain about the sensor by saying</text>
  <text start="430.509" dur="4.831">well you know your your publisher and</text>
  <text start="432.16" dur="6.72">you can&amp;#39;t censor my my free speech okay</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="6">so I realized that there is that big</text>
  <text start="438.88" dur="4.92">argument but it seems like no one is</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="4.62">discussing kind of what they can control</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="4.02">is the content maybe but maybe what</text>
  <text start="445.96" dur="5.22">about controlling the content creators</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="4.469">isn&amp;#39;t a discrimination case as well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="2.88">is it different from being a</text>
  <text start="452.289" dur="3.421">conservative now for being like a</text>
  <text start="454.06" dur="3.389">blogging getting kicked out of the</text>
  <text start="455.71" dur="4.5">restaurant or something back in the day</text>
  <text start="457.449" dur="7.321">I mean this is the same thing well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.21" dur="7.38">pretty close I mean I so somebody who is</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="5.579">on YouTube and offers a conservative</text>
  <text start="467.59" dur="4.41">view I mean you could go you know with</text>
  <text start="470.349" dur="3.69">the appropriate permits and so forth you</text>
  <text start="472" dur="3.72">could go anywhere and say these are my</text>
  <text start="474.039" dur="3.81">views and if they don&amp;#39;t really offend</text>
  <text start="475.72" dur="4.52">the First Amendment you&amp;#39;re allowed to</text>
  <text start="477.849" dur="4.951">say pretty much whatever you want to say</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="4.959">you know absent you know there&amp;#39;s a fire</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="5.52">in a theater and some other issues that</text>
  <text start="485.199" dur="6.121">do where you don&amp;#39;t get First Amendment</text>
  <text start="488.32" dur="6.42">protections so farst danger yeah so for</text>
  <text start="491.32" dur="6.029">a person who is a you know where YouTube</text>
  <text start="494.74" dur="5.609">or anybody Facebook is controlling</text>
  <text start="497.349" dur="5.011">content then you&amp;#39;re really getting into</text>
  <text start="500.349" dur="3.361">you know and into a dicey area and I</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="4.589">think the answer to your question is</text>
  <text start="503.71" dur="6.179">that that they should not be able to</text>
  <text start="506.949" dur="5.28">control content and if they start to</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="4.231">lose some of these protections that they</text>
  <text start="512.229" dur="4.5">have under the law then they would they</text>
  <text start="514.12" dur="4.409">might also have a court say well you</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="5.971">know you really you don&amp;#39;t have the right</text>
  <text start="518.529" dur="6.031">to say that to you know regulate what</text>
  <text start="522.7" dur="4.47">people say on the platform because it is</text>
  <text start="524.56" dur="4.98">in essence a a public square and and</text>
  <text start="527.17" dur="3.96">those arguments are have been made to</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="4.47">some degree and and it might be</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="4.53">something you know that that is viable</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="3.449">that we determine is a viable argument</text>
  <text start="535.66" dur="3.75">but I can&amp;#39;t tell you just yet because</text>
  <text start="537.459" dur="6.061">we&amp;#39;re still in the exploratory stages</text>
  <text start="539.41" dur="6.57">sure okay so the the biggest question</text>
  <text start="543.52" dur="4.35">that I&amp;#39;ve gotten by far is class action</text>
  <text start="545.98" dur="4.53">class action will will this be a class</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="4.38">action can we do a class action I not</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="5.16">knowing anything about them other than</text>
  <text start="552.25" dur="5.52">how to spell those words what do you</text>
  <text start="555.67" dur="4.08">think or can we instill no yeah works to</text>
  <text start="557.77" dur="4.19">people yeah I don&amp;#39;t know yet because</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="4.38">you&amp;#39;d have to see</text>
  <text start="561.96" dur="3.76">you would have to see what the claim is</text>
  <text start="564.13" dur="3">so for example if you&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="5.18">class-action lawsuit</text>
  <text start="567.13" dur="6.78">everybody has to basically you know</text>
  <text start="570.9" dur="5.11">suffer the same harm so you know</text>
  <text start="573.91" dur="4.11">class-action lawsuits are common things</text>
  <text start="576.01" dur="4.05">where you know everybody&amp;#39;s been injured</text>
  <text start="578.02" dur="4.77">by a particular drug or a particular</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="6.26">medical device and so once when the</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="6.27">injury is the same for everybody then</text>
  <text start="586.32" dur="4.69">it&amp;#39;s just a question of damages so one</text>
  <text start="589.06" dur="4.5">person gets a bad hip and they have to</text>
  <text start="591.01" dur="4.32">have it replaced and nothing you know</text>
  <text start="593.56" dur="3.9">the surgery goes fine the hips replaced</text>
  <text start="595.33" dur="3.81">they have a claim for an additional</text>
  <text start="597.46" dur="3.87">surgery but somebody else for example</text>
  <text start="599.14" dur="3.87">might the second surgery may not go well</text>
  <text start="601.33" dur="3.54">and they have to have a third they would</text>
  <text start="603.01" dur="3.54">have more damages but they have a class</text>
  <text start="604.87" dur="6.6">action everybody gets to suffer the same</text>
  <text start="606.55" dur="7.35">harm so conceivably if content creators</text>
  <text start="611.47" dur="4.74">such as you all had the same harm and</text>
  <text start="613.9" dur="5.16">that harm was that you&amp;#39;ll you were</text>
  <text start="616.21" dur="5.4">demonetized or suppressed in some way</text>
  <text start="619.06" dur="5.97">then you know conceivably yes you could</text>
  <text start="621.61" dur="5.46">say that is a class action ok so</text>
  <text start="625.03" dur="3.96">hopefully people will better understand</text>
  <text start="627.07" dur="3.78">that this light is a tube right or</text>

  <text start="630.85" dur="6.54">bit on me yeah we&amp;#39;re kind of near the</text>
  <text start="635.89" dur="3.18">end of my questions anyway because I</text>
  <text start="637.39" dur="3.18">understand we can&amp;#39;t be too detailed</text>
  <text start="639.07" dur="3.48">because we&amp;#39;re still researching this and</text>
  <text start="640.57" dur="4.02">because we don&amp;#39;t want to let anyone know</text>
  <text start="642.55" dur="4.29">what&amp;#39;s coming obviously if we do find</text>
  <text start="644.59" dur="6.15">something we&amp;#39;ll tell what we can as able</text>
  <text start="646.84" dur="7.47">but you know this is this is for real</text>
  <text start="650.74" dur="5.94">clearly if not us who if not now when</text>
  <text start="654.31" dur="5.07">somebody has to make a stand for our</text>
  <text start="656.68" dur="5.46">First Amendment rights and I&amp;#39;m here my</text>
  <text start="659.38" dur="4.02">dogs over there I feel like we have to</text>
  <text start="662.14" dur="3.81">do something and I feel like you know</text>
  <text start="663.4" dur="4.2">the good guys at the top or embattled</text>
  <text start="665.95" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re surrounded by you know people</text>
  <text start="667.6" dur="3.69">that care about free speech you know in</text>
  <text start="669.49" dur="3.72">the halls of power they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="671.29" dur="3.45">surrounded they&amp;#39;re outnumbered sometimes</text>
  <text start="673.21" dur="4.14">and I feel like maybe this is our way of</text>
  <text start="674.74" dur="5.28">helping out and that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="677.35" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;m doing this at least and and I&amp;#39;m glad</text>
  <text start="680.02" dur="4.5">to know that we have your you know you</text>
  <text start="682.51" dur="3.6">as well on this thing because you know</text>
  <text start="684.52" dur="3.3">you do care about this issue I can tell</text>
  <text start="686.11" dur="3.78">just talking to you my my words my ears</text>
  <text start="687.82" dur="4.38">yeah I know absolutely I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="689.89" dur="3.96">vital I mean I think that that you know</text>
  <text start="692.2" dur="3.27">the social media platforms really do</text>
  <text start="693.85" dur="4.05">govern</text>
  <text start="695.47" dur="3.87">so much of the public discourse so in</text>
  <text start="697.9" dur="3.33">other words it clearly will have an</text>
  <text start="699.34" dur="4.56">effect on elections it clearly has an</text>
  <text start="701.23" dur="5.43">effect on opinion right now the you know</text>
  <text start="703.9" dur="4.32">the mainstream media controls or has for</text>
  <text start="706.66" dur="2.91">a long time they don&amp;#39;t I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="708.22" dur="2.82">lots of arguments we don&amp;#39;t need to get</text>
  <text start="709.57" dur="3.48">into that but the mainstream media&amp;#39;s had</text>
  <text start="711.04" dur="5.37">the biggest megaphone and then to have</text>
  <text start="713.05" dur="5.16">social media come in and be a credible</text>
  <text start="716.41" dur="3.24">response to that and then have them try</text>
  <text start="718.21" dur="3.69">to suppress it so that they can maintain</text>
  <text start="719.65" dur="4.56">the dominant voice I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="721.9" dur="3.72">serious business that&amp;#39;s that is you know</text>
  <text start="724.21" dur="3.39">perhaps the most important thing as a</text>
  <text start="725.62" dur="4.61">nation that we face because we really</text>
  <text start="727.6" dur="5.61">are at this time of you know strong</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="5.25">division in opinions and if we can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="733.21" dur="4.95">our opinions out there then we cannot</text>
  <text start="735.48" dur="4.09">you know we can&amp;#39;t be heard and we have a</text>
  <text start="738.16" dur="4.83">right to be heard and we have a right</text>
  <text start="739.57" dur="6.39">not to let people that have opinions</text>
  <text start="742.99" dur="5.07">that we oppose than is our rights to</text>
  <text start="745.96" dur="4.5">free speech and so I guess the one thing</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="5.46">I want to close with is to let everybody</text>
  <text start="750.46" dur="5.76">know that you know what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="753.52" dur="5.55">together you and I is is a very deep</text>
  <text start="756.22" dur="7.35">dive serious research I mean I&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="763.57" dur="3.69">so forth that people have tried to file</text>
  <text start="765.13" dur="3.78">and I honestly haven&amp;#39;t been that</text>
  <text start="767.26" dur="3.99">impressed I don&amp;#39;t want to say which ones</text>
  <text start="768.91" dur="4.53">but I think that I haven&amp;#39;t seen anybody</text>
  <text start="771.25" dur="4.77">in some of the cases as well you know I</text>
  <text start="773.44" dur="5.15">haven&amp;#39;t seen anybody that&amp;#39;s really made</text>

  <text start="784.69" dur="3.69">companies to do what they&amp;#39;re doing with</text>
