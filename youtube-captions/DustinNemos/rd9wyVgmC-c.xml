  <text start="99.63" dur="4.199">watching this from Dustin&amp;#39;s channel I am</text>
  <text start="101.729" dur="4.801">filling in for him while he&amp;#39;s in DC he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="4.591">covering the Q rally right now so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="106.53" dur="4.589">why I&amp;#39;m here and not Dustin in case you</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="4.26">were wondering so let&amp;#39;s get into this</text>
  <text start="111.119" dur="3.601">the first thing I want to cover is this</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="4.2">story Caddo Parish mental health</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="4.41">counseling firm owner and supervisor</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="4.5">indicted for billing nearly 8 million</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="4.699">dollars for services not provided and</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="6.9">paying kickbacks so what they did was</text>
  <text start="123.829" dur="7.18">was they either took the Medicaid number</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="5.19">from clients from legitimate client</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="4.951">clients and they use that to</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="4.32">bill Medicaid for services they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="135.96" dur="5.07">provide without the knowledge of the</text>
  <text start="137.79" dur="6.09">client and they also recruit recruited</text>
  <text start="141.03" dur="5.64">excuse me recruited other quote unquote</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="5.37">clients to sign up for programs that</text>
  <text start="146.67" dur="4.74">they never participated in and of course</text>
  <text start="149.25" dur="4.59">then the provider would be paid for that</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="5.61">and then the client quote unquote would</text>
  <text start="153.84" dur="5.25">get the kickback for signing up so this</text>
  <text start="157.02" dur="5.43">is fraud and this is not a good thing it</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="6.66">harms individuals and I&amp;#39;ll explain why</text>
  <text start="162.45" dur="7.11">so and I know this personally because I</text>
  <text start="165.75" dur="7.02">work in the healthcare field so to speak</text>
  <text start="169.56" dur="8.13">so and I work with individuals with</text>
  <text start="172.77" dur="8.46">disabilities mostly so when it comes to</text>
  <text start="177.69" dur="7.17">Medicaid Medicaid serves a lot of</text>
  <text start="181.23" dur="6.56">children and individuals with either</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="6.3">physical disabilities or developmental</text>
  <text start="187.79" dur="8.5">disabilities these are people who are</text>
  <text start="191.16" dur="7.2">hugely vulnerable so what happens is is</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="7.11">there is a certain amount of money</text>
  <text start="198.36" dur="6.659">that&amp;#39;s allocated for this population for</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="3.33">certain populations you have a certain</text>
  <text start="205.019" dur="3.031">amount of money that&amp;#39;s for children and</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="3.6">then you have a certain amount of money</text>
  <text start="208.05" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s for people with disabilities</text>
  <text start="210.33" dur="6.659">there&amp;#39;s these different brackets with</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="10.07">different budgets now right now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="5.811">a problem because they&amp;#39;re saying that</text>
  <text start="223.31" dur="6.73">services for people with disabilities is</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="6.15">hugely underfunded but that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="5.4">problem and of course the government</text>
  <text start="233.4" dur="5.309">will not allocate more money to that Pro</text>
  <text start="235.44" dur="5">to that program here&amp;#39;s a problem it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="5.491">not that there&amp;#39;s not enough money</text>
  <text start="240.44" dur="7.56">because there is it&amp;#39;s not allocated</text>
  <text start="244.2" dur="8.61">properly and this demonstrates that</text>
  <text start="248" dur="7.12">because when you have a provider that is</text>
  <text start="252.81" dur="3.799">stealing eight million dollars because</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing they stole it</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="6.851">from this program from this</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="6.99">reimbursement program so they claim to</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="3.35">have provided services they did not they</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="3.259">were paid for</text>
  <text start="266.81" dur="5.13">that and then guess what there are other</text>
  <text start="269.389" dur="4.591">individuals who don&amp;#39;t receive services</text>
  <text start="271.94" dur="4.8">because the budgets not there why</text>
  <text start="273.98" dur="5.13">because people like this and this is not</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="4.62">the only person who doesn&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m sure so</text>
  <text start="279.11" dur="6">much more than eight million dollars has</text>
  <text start="281.36" dur="9.45">been stolen from Medicaid from those</text>
  <text start="285.11" dur="8.91">other individuals who need it because</text>
  <text start="290.81" dur="6.69">what happens then is is if this money is</text>
  <text start="294.02" dur="6.84">allocated away from people who really</text>
  <text start="297.5" dur="11.639">need it they&amp;#39;re not going to give more</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="14.91">and that&amp;#39;s what happens see this too</text>
  <text start="309.139" dur="10.891">often this is a problem every single</text>
  <text start="315.77" dur="8.01">person who is defrauding the Medicaid</text>
  <text start="320.03" dur="6.59">program needs to be routed out because</text>
  <text start="323.78" dur="6.18">they are harming individuals there are</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="5.68">children with disabilities who are not</text>
  <text start="329.96" dur="4.38">and adults with disabilities who are not</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="5.48">able to receive services because they</text>
  <text start="334.34" dur="3.44">don&amp;#39;t have enough in their budget</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="14.02">because the budget is being stolen from</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="12.429">by crooks like this huge problem all</text>
  <text start="351.83" dur="5.85">right the other thing i want to talk</text>
  <text start="353.539" dur="7.281">about john bolton he is out so of course</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="6.42">he was a hugely controversial figure now</text>
  <text start="360.82" dur="5.74">it doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me that the same</text>
  <text start="364.1" dur="5.34">people who were screaming about how they</text>
  <text start="366.56" dur="6.44">hated the fact that john bolton was the</text>
  <text start="369.44" dur="6.06">pick for the national security advisor</text>
  <text start="373" dur="5.35">those same people are the ones who are</text>
  <text start="375.5" dur="3.12">criticizing the fact that he&amp;#39;s leaving</text>
  <text start="378.35" dur="4.5">now</text>
  <text start="378.62" dur="8.13">that he&amp;#39;s fired really you cannot win</text>
  <text start="382.85" dur="7.26">with these people i mean if you told</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="8.76">them if trump told them that the sky was</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="6.96">blue they would say it&amp;#39;s green the only</text>
  <text start="395.51" dur="3.93">thing they want to do is just oppose</text>
  <text start="397.07" dur="4.74">what President Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="399.44" dur="4.08">so the good news is is john bolton is</text>
  <text start="401.81" dur="4.47">out as a president Trump had said that</text>
  <text start="403.52" dur="8.73">he didn&amp;#39;t like his policies he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="7.32">agree with him so this is what President</text>
  <text start="412.25" dur="4.02">Trump had to say about it he says I</text>
  <text start="413.6" dur="4.2">informed John Bolton last night that his</text>
  <text start="416.27" dur="3.36">services are no longer needed at the</text>
  <text start="417.8" dur="4.26">White House I disagreed strongly with</text>
  <text start="419.63" dur="4.35">many of his suggestions as did others in</text>
  <text start="422.06" dur="4.08">the administration and therefore I asked</text>
  <text start="423.98" dur="2.91">John for his resignation which was given</text>
  <text start="426.14" dur="2.64">to me this morning</text>
  <text start="426.89" dur="3.96">I thanked John very much for his service</text>
  <text start="428.78" dur="6.39">I will be naming a new national security</text>
  <text start="430.85" dur="6.12">adviser next week so this is a good</text>
  <text start="435.17" dur="4.26">thing and especially because this is the</text>
  <text start="436.97" dur="5.67">same man who was really opposed to the</text>
  <text start="439.43" dur="7.68">idea of pulling out of Syria we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="442.64" dur="6.84">need to be in Syria and of course</text>
  <text start="447.11" dur="5.04">they&amp;#39;re talking about how we have to be</text>
  <text start="449.48" dur="5.85">there because Isis has a stronghold</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="6.57">there we not we but the shadow</text>
  <text start="455.33" dur="9.95">government of the United States had</text>
  <text start="458.72" dur="12.54">created Isis as a proxy army in order to</text>
  <text start="465.28" dur="9.34">kick out Assad not that Assad is a</text>
  <text start="471.26" dur="5.52">stellar guy because he&amp;#39;s not but the</text>
  <text start="474.62" dur="7.52">whole purpose of getting him out was in</text>
  <text start="476.78" dur="9.8">order to replace him with a puppet and</text>
  <text start="482.14" dur="7.21">so Assad was one of the last standing</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="10.03">leaders in the Middle East after the</text>
  <text start="489.35" dur="8.91">Arab Spring which we catalyzed so</text>
  <text start="496.61" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;ve been trying to get him out by</text>
  <text start="498.26" dur="8.76">whatever means necessary we don&amp;#39;t belong</text>
  <text start="502.82" dur="7.08">there we do not belong there just like</text>
  <text start="507.02" dur="8.25">we don&amp;#39;t belong in Afghanistan we need</text>
  <text start="509.9" dur="11.04">to pull our guys out reserve them for</text>
  <text start="515.27" dur="7.53">our own fight that&amp;#39;s not our fight so</text>
  <text start="520.94" dur="3.33">I&amp;#39;m glad to see John Bolton go now of</text>
  <text start="522.8" dur="4.83">course doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="5.509">Mitt Romney has expressed his</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="5.36">displeasure with this move</text>
  <text start="529.779" dur="5.461">of course he says cool I&amp;#39;m very very</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="4.199">unhappy to hear that he is leaving it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="535.24" dur="4.38">a huge loss for the administration and</text>
  <text start="537.189" dur="4.44">for the nation john bolton is a</text>
  <text start="539.62" dur="3.779">brilliant man with decades of experience</text>
  <text start="541.629" dur="4.291">in foreign policy his point of view is</text>
  <text start="543.399" dur="3.841">not always the same as everybody else in</text>
  <text start="545.92" dur="4.349">the room and that&amp;#39;s why you wanted him</text>
  <text start="547.24" dur="5.279">there end quote and of course when asked</text>
  <text start="550.269" dur="5.94">who the replacement should be for john</text>
  <text start="552.519" dur="7.351">bolton he replied with john bolton not</text>
  <text start="556.209" dur="6.901">surprised in the least at all each with</text>
  <text start="559.87" dur="7.319">each passing day mit romney continues to</text>
  <text start="563.11" dur="7.44">demonstrate what a rhino he is but</text>
  <text start="567.189" dur="6.421">really again you know when it comes to</text>
  <text start="570.55" dur="7.649">Republican versus Democrat that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="573.61" dur="6.87">actually the reality of it that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="578.199" dur="3.33">the illusion they want us to think that</text>
  <text start="580.48" dur="3.479">there are two different parties</text>
  <text start="581.529" dur="6.78">Democrats and Republicans but that those</text>
  <text start="583.959" dur="8.391">are not the real parties the reason why</text>
  <text start="588.309" dur="6.181">there are quote rhinos is because</text>
  <text start="592.35" dur="4.929">Republican and Democrat that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="594.49" dur="6.06">real parties the real parties are those</text>
  <text start="597.279" dur="8.16">who are globalists and those who are</text>
  <text start="600.55" dur="9.719">Patriots this guy Mitt Romney he is a</text>
  <text start="605.439" dur="7.471">globalist not a patriot and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="610.269" dur="5.67">something that he&amp;#39;s a RINO not really a</text>
  <text start="612.91" dur="7.71">RINO because there&amp;#39;s no no such thing</text>
  <text start="615.939" dur="6.57">really as Republicans and Democrats not</text>
  <text start="620.62" dur="4.68">really and that&amp;#39;s just my opinion on</text>
  <text start="622.509" dur="7.2">that situation but his opinion on John</text>
  <text start="625.3" dur="8.55">Bolton does not surprise me okay</text>
  <text start="629.709" dur="7.98">next up so apparently we just dropped a</text>
  <text start="633.85" dur="6.719">ton of bombs on Isis infested island in</text>
  <text start="637.689" dur="4.681">Iraq so this is huge</text>
  <text start="640.569" dur="3.351">looks like president Trump is not</text>
  <text start="642.37" dur="5.129">messing around when it comes to</text>
  <text start="643.92" dur="5.229">eradicating Isis so we&amp;#39;re not toying</text>
  <text start="647.499" dur="2.88">with them and of course this is</text>
  <text start="649.149" dur="3.271">something that was totally and</text>
  <text start="650.379" dur="4.65">completely unexpected which I guess</text>
  <text start="652.42" dur="4.259">could be expected from President Trump</text>
  <text start="655.029" dur="3.961">cuz he&amp;#39;s always said that he would never</text>
  <text start="656.679" dur="4.5">let his enemy know he would never give</text>
  <text start="658.99" dur="4.079">any indication or any clue as to what he</text>
  <text start="661.179" dur="2.881">was going to do when it comes to</text>
  <text start="663.069" dur="2.701">fighting</text>
  <text start="664.06" dur="3.54">and you don&amp;#39;t want to tell the enemy</text>
  <text start="665.77" dur="4.5">your plan you don&amp;#39;t want to tell them oh</text>
  <text start="667.6" dur="6.12">hey yeah so I&amp;#39;m gonna come to your house</text>
  <text start="670.27" dur="7.47">on Tuesday at 3 o&amp;#39;clock you better be</text>
  <text start="673.72" dur="6.63">there no it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way you</text>
  <text start="677.74" dur="4.92">can&amp;#39;t tell the enemy your plan then that</text>
  <text start="680.35" dur="4.44">gives them the opportunity to counter</text>
  <text start="682.66" dur="5.61">that plan before you even enact that</text>
  <text start="684.79" dur="5.94">plan so this does not come as it</text>
  <text start="688.27" dur="5.76">surprised me but I think this is a good</text>
  <text start="690.73" dur="6.66">thing that we are being so bold against</text>
  <text start="694.03" dur="5.15">Isis because that&amp;#39;s the only way we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="697.39" dur="6.83">gonna eradicate them really and that</text>
  <text start="699.18" dur="5.04">goes for any terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="704.31" dur="8.98">we&amp;#39;re not messing around</text>
  <text start="707.97" dur="7.75">ok now this little piece of news the</text>
  <text start="713.29" dur="4.29">reason why I&amp;#39;m covering it is because</text>
  <text start="715.72" dur="6.72">this is serious business</text>
  <text start="717.58" dur="7.8">so apparently Green Day singer had</text>
  <text start="722.44" dur="5.4">screamed kill Donald Trump during one of</text>
  <text start="725.38" dur="6.33">his concerts recently the reason why</text>
  <text start="727.84" dur="7.86">this is a big deal is because when it</text>
  <text start="731.71" dur="6.68">comes to celebrities whether it be the</text>
  <text start="735.7" dur="7.34">music industry the film industry</text>
  <text start="738.39" dur="9.54">whatever industry their purpose is to</text>
  <text start="743.04" dur="6.79">feed to the public a certain idea</text>
  <text start="747.93" dur="8.02">they&amp;#39;re supposed to see the</text>
  <text start="749.83" dur="10.38">consciousness with certain ideas so with</text>
  <text start="755.95" dur="7.49">this guy screaming kill Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="760.21" dur="6.75">somewhere in there is a crazed fan</text>
  <text start="763.44" dur="7.96">willing to take out his command or what</text>
  <text start="766.96" dur="8.49">they feel is his command because some of</text>
  <text start="771.4" dur="9.66">these people are really totally</text>
  <text start="775.45" dur="10.2">enthralled by these celebrities they</text>
  <text start="781.06" dur="5.97">follow the stars so they&amp;#39;re banking on</text>
  <text start="785.65" dur="3.69">the fact that one of these crazed</text>
  <text start="787.03" dur="4.35">individuals is going to take that to</text>
  <text start="789.34" dur="5.85">heart and they will find whatever means</text>
  <text start="791.38" dur="6.07">necessary in order to carry that out</text>
  <text start="795.19" dur="4.6">this is dangerous and this is not the</text>
  <text start="797.45" dur="7.11">first time that they&amp;#39;ve tried to put</text>
  <text start="799.79" dur="8.12">this out there I mean we had Kathie Lee</text>
  <text start="804.56" dur="5.88">Gifford with her skit with the head and</text>
  <text start="807.91" dur="9.21">there has been plenty others that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="810.44" dur="10.68">presented the idea of death to trot</text>
  <text start="817.12" dur="7.53">they&amp;#39;re serious about this so this is</text>
  <text start="821.12" dur="7.71">something that should be very concerned</text>
  <text start="824.65" dur="5.65">okay also speaking of pushing certain</text>
  <text start="828.83" dur="3.57">narratives I wanted to highlight this</text>
  <text start="830.3" dur="3.72">this isn&amp;#39;t really news but I wanted to</text>
  <text start="832.4" dur="3.66">point this out because I noticed this</text>
  <text start="834.02" dur="4.5">today and I&amp;#39;ve noticed it before but</text>
  <text start="836.06" dur="5.01">really today I noticed a lot because for</text>
  <text start="838.52" dur="5.28">some reason I had a ton of Promoted</text>
  <text start="841.07" dur="4.86">Tweets on my Twitter feed so I&amp;#39;m sure</text>

  <text start="849.35" dur="4.02">yourself why is this year why am I</text>
  <text start="851.72" dur="4.08">seeing this on my feed</text>
  <text start="853.37" dur="4.38">I don&amp;#39;t follow this at all and then if</text>
  <text start="855.8" dur="4.32">you look at the bottom it says promoted</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="4.71">by such-and-such right it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="860.12" dur="6.51">promoted tweet these are the things that</text>
  <text start="862.46" dur="7.2">they want you to see so for example this</text>
  <text start="866.63" dur="4.86">one here is from Sandy Hook promise and</text>
  <text start="869.66" dur="4.59">it says it shows this picture of this</text>
  <text start="871.49" dur="4.86">little boy here of course and pulling on</text>
  <text start="874.25" dur="3.78">the heartstrings are trying to says the</text>

  <text start="894.59" dur="5.82">there&amp;#39;s a link to go sign the petition</text>
  <text start="896.87" dur="6.48">now what they&amp;#39;re talking about here is</text>
  <text start="900.41" dur="4.89">the same thing that Joe Biden had</text>
  <text start="903.35" dur="3.51">suggested and at that time when he</text>
  <text start="905.3" dur="3.39">brought it up I was still trying to</text>
  <text start="906.86" dur="4.35">figure out whether or not he actually</text>
  <text start="908.69" dur="6.9">was aware of what he was calling for</text>
  <text start="911.21" dur="9.18">because he has shown some symptoms as</text>
  <text start="915.59" dur="6.66">far as maybe having some slight dementia</text>
  <text start="920.39" dur="4.92">or something going on because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="922.25" dur="5.3">fumbled quite a bit so I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if</text>
  <text start="925.31" dur="4.25">it was because he wanted to</text>
  <text start="927.55" dur="3.78">push this policy or because he had no</text>
  <text start="929.56" dur="3.839">idea what he was talking about but</text>
  <text start="931.33" dur="4.41">apparently this is the policy that they</text>
  <text start="933.399" dur="5.821">want to push so when they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="935.74" dur="6.18">about multiple rounds now this petition</text>
  <text start="939.22" dur="6.989">is saying oh you know let&amp;#39;s limit them</text>
  <text start="941.92" dur="6.57">to ten rounds but Joe Biden pushed even</text>
  <text start="946.209" dur="5.041">further than that I said multiple rounds</text>
  <text start="948.49" dur="5.039">any magazine that holds multiple rounds</text>
  <text start="951.25" dur="7.94">which is virtually any gun should be</text>
  <text start="953.529" dur="8.011">eliminated that&amp;#39;s what they want to push</text>
  <text start="959.19" dur="5.07">so that&amp;#39;s what they want you to see and</text>
  <text start="961.54" dur="6.51">then also at the same time another</text>
  <text start="964.26" dur="8.38">narrative push so this was also in a</text>
  <text start="968.05" dur="6.21">promoted tweet that was actually only a</text>
  <text start="972.64" dur="3.449">few tweets after the last one that I</text>
  <text start="974.26" dur="3.63">shown you so it was promoted to eat</text>
  <text start="976.089" dur="4.761">after promoted tweet after promoted to</text>
  <text start="977.89" dur="7.4">eat they&amp;#39;re trying to push their agendas</text>
  <text start="980.85" dur="8.32">so this one is from Bloomberg tick tock</text>
  <text start="985.29" dur="5.89">says watch what role will Big Oil and</text>
  <text start="989.17" dur="5.58">utility companies play in the transition</text>
  <text start="991.18" dur="5.7">to a low-carbon economy goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="994.75" dur="3.93">research explains because of course we</text>
  <text start="996.88" dur="6.99">will believe everything goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="998.68" dur="10.279">research tells us at this point we</text>
  <text start="1003.87" dur="7.62">understand that any research</text>
  <text start="1008.959" dur="13.301">quote-unquote i say research very</text>
  <text start="1011.49" dur="14.339">loosely here is my farce this research</text>
  <text start="1022.26" dur="6.6">is being funded and so of course the</text>
  <text start="1025.829" dur="6.12">data that is presented is completely</text>
  <text start="1028.86" dur="5.49">skewed in order to present the narrative</text>
  <text start="1031.949" dur="5.73">to present the findings that are going</text>
  <text start="1034.35" dur="5.52">to be favorable to those who are funding</text>
  <text start="1037.679" dur="8.221">their research that way they can</text>
  <text start="1039.87" dur="10.71">continue to receive funding this</text>
  <text start="1045.9" dur="7.95">research is not real and then any real</text>
  <text start="1050.58" dur="9.29">study that&amp;#39;s done on the environment or</text>
  <text start="1053.85" dur="6.02">anything really it&amp;#39;s s&amp;#39;prise</text>
  <text start="1060.37" dur="5.65">because that research doesn&amp;#39;t show the</text>
  <text start="1064.37" dur="5.01">findings that they want to present to</text>
  <text start="1066.02" dur="9.54">the public in order to shape their</text>
  <text start="1069.38" dur="9.45">opinion so again they&amp;#39;re using social</text>
  <text start="1075.56" dur="6.54">media to push these narratives which</text>
  <text start="1078.83" dur="6.92">really isn&amp;#39;t a surprise at all okay in</text>
  <text start="1082.1" dur="7.41">other news this is an Epstein updates so</text>
  <text start="1085.75" dur="9.15">apparently the feds are saying now that</text>
  <text start="1089.51" dur="10.2">Epstein did not die in his cell this is</text>
  <text start="1094.9" dur="9.22">huge because the narrative was that he</text>
  <text start="1099.71" dur="8.82">hung himself with a bedsheet in his cell</text>
  <text start="1104.12" dur="5.85">and that officers correction officers</text>
  <text start="1108.53" dur="4.02">did not check on him like they were</text>
  <text start="1109.97" dur="4.95">supposed to well why would they check on</text>
  <text start="1112.55" dur="6.18">him if he wasn&amp;#39;t even in his cell</text>
  <text start="1114.92" dur="6.39">so apparently shortly before his death</text>
  <text start="1118.73" dur="6.06">he was transferred to another part of</text>
  <text start="1121.31" dur="7.08">the facility he wasn&amp;#39;t even in his cell</text>
  <text start="1124.79" dur="5.73">then supposedly he was brought back to</text>
  <text start="1128.39" dur="6.23">his cell shortly before they called 911</text>
  <text start="1130.52" dur="10.8">and he was in a wheelchair</text>
  <text start="1134.62" dur="9.94">so what happened in between now whether</text>
  <text start="1141.32" dur="6">or not they&amp;#39;re going to reveal what had</text>
  <text start="1144.56" dur="10.41">happened if they find out has yet to be</text>
  <text start="1147.32" dur="11.97">seen but just this fact alone now that</text>
  <text start="1154.97" dur="8.25">makes this whole suicide narrative</text>
  <text start="1159.29" dur="10.92">totally uncredible it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1163.22" dur="8.76">questionable at this point so a lot of</text>
  <text start="1170.21" dur="3.12">things are not adding up in this but of</text>
  <text start="1171.98" dur="5.34">course at this point we already</text>
  <text start="1173.33" dur="10.53">understand that Epstein was high-risk</text>
  <text start="1177.32" dur="8.25">anyway because he knew too much</text>
  <text start="1183.86" dur="3.57">and</text>
  <text start="1185.57" dur="4.34">I was actually talking to someone</text>
  <text start="1187.43" dur="5.58">recently about John Luke Bernal and</text>
  <text start="1189.91" dur="4.84">about how he&amp;#39;s missing right now and</text>
  <text start="1193.01" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re not able to find him in how he</text>
  <text start="1194.75" dur="6.87">is a key individual in all of this as</text>
  <text start="1197.87" dur="10.97">well I was told that it&amp;#39;s likely that</text>
  <text start="1201.62" dur="7.22">he&amp;#39;s dead and that&amp;#39;s probably the case</text>
  <text start="1209.26" dur="7.93">because he was also a key figure I know</text>
  <text start="1215.45" dur="4.14">some news outlets had called him a</text>
  <text start="1217.19" dur="5.67">witness but he wasn&amp;#39;t just a witness</text>
  <text start="1219.59" dur="10.2">John Luke Brunel was a key part in all</text>
  <text start="1222.86" dur="9.75">of that and the whole modeling agency so</text>
  <text start="1229.79" dur="5.81">I will be giving more updates as they</text>
  <text start="1232.61" dur="6.11">come up on this but this is a huge</text>
  <text start="1235.6" dur="7.35">breakthrough and the evidence that</text>
  <text start="1238.72" dur="4.23">basically counters their whole narrative</text>
  <text start="1243.07" dur="4.21">okay</text>
  <text start="1244.28" dur="5.97">other news this one is quite ironic</text>
  <text start="1247.28" dur="6">so Rachel Maddow is currently being sued</text>
  <text start="1250.25" dur="5.46">for 10 million dollars by one American</text>
  <text start="1253.28" dur="5.52">network because apparently she had</text>
  <text start="1255.71" dur="9.29">called them a paid Russian propaganda</text>
  <text start="1258.8" dur="9.09">outlet so because of her attack on them</text>
  <text start="1265" dur="9.73">they are now suing her which I find</text>
  <text start="1267.89" dur="11.4">hugely hilarious now really she is the</text>
  <text start="1274.73" dur="7.95">propaganda outlet so projection much</text>
  <text start="1279.29" dur="6.66">yeah because she was the one who is</text>
  <text start="1282.68" dur="5.97">constantly pushing the idea of the whole</text>
  <text start="1285.95" dur="4.02">Russian collusion and that President</text>
  <text start="1288.65" dur="2.97">Trump in his campaign they were all</text>
  <text start="1289.97" dur="5.34">colluding with Russia Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="1291.62" dur="8.76">Russia so if anybody was at propaganda</text>
  <text start="1295.31" dur="11.97">outlet she was okay finally I want to</text>
  <text start="1300.38" dur="11.61">touch on 9/11 so of course today is the</text>
  <text start="1307.28" dur="6.81">anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and we</text>
  <text start="1311.99" dur="5.019">should not ever forget about what</text>
  <text start="1314.09" dur="8.169">happened on that day</text>
  <text start="1317.009" dur="7.841">really I don&amp;#39;t want to get into too much</text>
  <text start="1322.259" dur="4.54">about you know the different theories</text>
  <text start="1324.85" dur="4.409">that are out there I know I have a few</text>
  <text start="1326.799" dur="4.83">of my own for for sure I don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="1329.259" dur="7.02">the official narrative that they push</text>
  <text start="1331.629" dur="6.92">out but I think that should be something</text>
  <text start="1336.279" dur="6.9">that&amp;#39;s talked about in a different video</text>
  <text start="1338.549" dur="8.021">because it deserves a lot more time but</text>
  <text start="1343.179" dur="5.161">I just wanted a highlight here how some</text>
  <text start="1346.57" dur="5.37">of us will remember that day a lot</text>
  <text start="1348.34" dur="6.27">differently than some others for example</text>
  <text start="1351.94" dur="4.77">I know a lot of people can remember</text>
  <text start="1354.61" dur="6.63">where they were what they were doing</text>
  <text start="1356.71" dur="10.74">when it happened I know I do I was 17</text>
  <text start="1361.24" dur="8.37">years old and I was driving and I even</text>
  <text start="1367.45" dur="6.27">remember the road that I was on when I</text>
  <text start="1369.61" dur="5.939">was driving I was on Hampton and I was</text>
  <text start="1373.72" dur="6.089">listening to it on the radio and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1375.549" dur="10.411">how I found out about it now of course</text>
  <text start="1379.809" dur="10.2">at that time 17 years old I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1385.96" dur="4.89">really understand what was going on at</text>
  <text start="1390.009" dur="4.101">that time</text>
  <text start="1390.85" dur="6.209">and it wasn&amp;#39;t until some years later</text>
  <text start="1394.11" dur="5.649">when I started really looking at what</text>
  <text start="1397.059" dur="4.921">happened and thinking about it</text>
  <text start="1399.759" dur="5.16">critically that it occurred to me that</text>
  <text start="1401.98" dur="6.449">the narrative that they had told us was</text>
  <text start="1404.919" dur="5.34">not the truth and then of course I would</text>
  <text start="1408.429" dur="3.901">learn that that applied to a lot of</text>
  <text start="1410.259" dur="11.431">things that the government would try to</text>
  <text start="1412.33" dur="14.189">tell us so when it comes to what really</text>
  <text start="1421.69" dur="10.13">happened on that day and the role that</text>
  <text start="1426.519" dur="8.821">our government played in that it should</text>
  <text start="1431.82" dur="7.359">infuriate those who know about it who</text>
  <text start="1435.34" dur="9.35">understand the implications of the fact</text>
  <text start="1439.179" dur="5.511">that we have a government that</text>
  <text start="1446.55" dur="10.84">cares so little about human life they</text>
  <text start="1452.71" dur="7.59">will sacrifice any number of individuals</text>
  <text start="1457.39" dur="5.49">in order to push their agenda and of</text>
  <text start="1460.3" dur="12.27">course this was to happen a few years</text>
  <text start="1462.88" dur="15.27">later in 2013 with Benghazi but again</text>
  <text start="1472.57" dur="15">that&amp;#39;s another issue but the big picture</text>
  <text start="1478.15" dur="15.18">was that they needed an excuse to get us</text>
  <text start="1487.57" dur="10.14">into the Middle East because generally</text>
  <text start="1493.33" dur="6.45">speaking we don&amp;#39;t like war and we</text>
  <text start="1497.71" dur="5.18">definitely don&amp;#39;t like unnecessary Wars</text>
  <text start="1499.78" dur="9.6">and we definitely don&amp;#39;t like unnecessary</text>
  <text start="1502.89" dur="13.87">invasions for the purposes of personal</text>
  <text start="1509.38" dur="14.24">enrichment so how do they do that they</text>
  <text start="1516.76" dur="6.86">have to create some kind of catastrophe</text>
  <text start="1524.94" dur="8.98">that can get the people emotionally</text>
  <text start="1528.88" dur="6.75">invested in their idea but again I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1533.92" dur="3.96">want to talk about that too much in</text>
  <text start="1535.63" dur="4.29">detail right now I do want to say that</text>
  <text start="1537.88" dur="6.63">it&amp;#39;s important to remember the folks</text>
  <text start="1539.92" dur="8.25">that did die on that day and to remember</text>
  <text start="1544.51" dur="5.85">the folks that died because they risk</text>
  <text start="1548.17" dur="10.97">their lives trying to save others the</text>
  <text start="1550.36" dur="8.78">first responders these are heroes</text>
  <text start="1561.62" dur="13.159">they valued life and they valued other&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1570.32" dur="8.479">lives sometimes even beyond their own</text>
  <text start="1574.779" dur="13.121">and so this article that I found was</text>
  <text start="1578.799" dur="12.571">written by a young veteran who explains</text>

  <text start="1595.19" dur="15.239">saw a memorial coming through</text>
  <text start="1600.289" dur="12.031">Afghanistan because when he when when</text>
  <text start="1610.429" dur="7.35">this event happened he was only four</text>
  <text start="1612.32" dur="8.219">years old and so he doesn&amp;#39;t really he</text>
