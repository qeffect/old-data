  <text start="5.85" dur="3.329">by dr. Michael Silbert and he has a</text>
  <text start="7.62" dur="2.97">pretty interesting story to tell us and</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="2.821">I&amp;#39;m gonna let him kind of introduce</text>
  <text start="10.59" dur="4.919">himself and kind of fill you in on his</text>
  <text start="12" dur="5.82">background but his story came to me via</text>
  <text start="15.509" dur="4.231">a friend and and and I don&amp;#39;t get to do</text>
  <text start="17.82" dur="4.41">as much work as I would like and in sort</text>
  <text start="19.74" dur="3.959">of covering some interesting things an</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="3.9">alternative health and hopefully I can</text>
  <text start="23.699" dur="5.311">in the future but this is one that I</text>
  <text start="26.13" dur="4.53">really thought should be shared so doc I</text>
  <text start="29.01" dur="3.209">really appreciate your time and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="30.66" dur="4.68">sort of let you introduce yourself and</text>
  <text start="32.219" dur="5.851">kind of frame frame the conversation the</text>
  <text start="35.34" dur="4.739">way you&amp;#39;d like to start okay great so my</text>
  <text start="38.07" dur="4.05">name is dr. Michael silver I am a</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="6">chiropractor I practice in Chicago</text>
  <text start="42.12" dur="7.31">Illinois and I have a company that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="46.079" dur="5.701">called easy notes which designs</text>
  <text start="49.43" dur="5.44">documentation software for chiropractors</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="6.15">and Frank I was the one who had designed</text>
  <text start="54.87" dur="5.369">my website and one day several months</text>
  <text start="57.93" dur="5.01">ago he said to me are you familiar with</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="5.011">the term chelation therapy and I said I</text>
  <text start="62.94" dur="4.53">actually am I used to run a clinic back</text>
  <text start="65.25" dur="5.1">in the late 70s that was a collision</text>
  <text start="67.47" dur="8.37">clinic in the World Trade Center of New</text>
  <text start="70.35" dur="8.37">York City and my job was to hook people</text>
  <text start="75.84" dur="5.16">up to intravenous therapy and then after</text>
  <text start="78.72" dur="4.53">three hours of black to drip take the</text>
  <text start="81" dur="3.96">meals out because it&amp;#39;s amazing that you</text>
  <text start="83.25" dur="4.11">actually know what I&amp;#39;m talking about I</text>
  <text start="84.96" dur="4.199">said no no I&amp;#39;ve been sort of explosive</text>
  <text start="87.36" dur="5.939">it&amp;#39;s a long time he said well I said why</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="8.1">he said I&amp;#39;m working with two gentlemen</text>
  <text start="93.299" dur="6.691">that have created a transdermal</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="5.97">chelation cream and that you apply at</text>
  <text start="99.99" dur="5.339">night it&amp;#39;s absorbed some body has the</text>
  <text start="103.229" dur="4.17">same EDTA that you used to use when you</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="6.121">were dripping people and it helps</text>
  <text start="107.399" dur="5.76">excrete lead among other things in the</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="4.89">morning when you finally urinated in the</text>
  <text start="113.159" dur="4.801">morning and I said that&amp;#39;s great because</text>
  <text start="116.34" dur="4.739">there&amp;#39;s a lot of downsides to looking</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="5.4">somebody else beside cost and sitting</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="4.921">there for three hours I said do you have</text>
  <text start="123.36" dur="6.48">clinical studies that show that this</text>
  <text start="126" dur="5.849">works and he said no and I said seems a</text>
  <text start="129.84" dur="3.55">little Spain do not quit studies because</text>
  <text start="131.849" dur="4.571">well they&amp;#39;re very expensive to do</text>
  <text start="133.39" dur="4.17">so I said how about if I did he goes</text>
  <text start="136.42" dur="4.38">knock yourself out</text>
  <text start="137.56" dur="5.1">so I contacted a lab that I used to deal</text>
  <text start="140.8" dur="4.92">with that&amp;#39;s actually here in Illinois</text>
  <text start="142.66" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s called doctors data and I spoke to</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="5.58">me lead scientist for the facility and I</text>
  <text start="148.09" dur="6.03">said if I were to prove that this works</text>
  <text start="151.3" dur="3.27">or doesn&amp;#39;t work how would I design the</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="2.46">space</text>
  <text start="154.57" dur="3.42">I know it&amp;#39;s limited it&amp;#39;s only one person</text>
  <text start="156.58" dur="3.45">miss Betty for me</text>
  <text start="157.99" dur="4.02">but how would I design it&amp;#39;s doing it</text>
  <text start="160.03" dur="3.179">when you&amp;#39;re late sorry we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="3.3">interesting for sure</text>
  <text start="163.209" dur="6.271">yeah so I said this he said this what</text>
  <text start="165.31" dur="8.34">you do he said you would get our kit I</text>
  <text start="169.48" dur="5.82">can show you what it looks like sure</text>
  <text start="173.65" dur="7.88">I&amp;#39;ll grab the model later talking about</text>
  <text start="175.3" dur="6.23">my work on the kit looks like this</text>
  <text start="182.19" dur="7.24">so one gets for kit and I&amp;#39;m first thing</text>
  <text start="187.06" dur="4.86">in the morning you urinate and collect</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="5.64">the earth that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a great I have</text>
  <text start="191.92" dur="7.23">those two yes doesn&amp;#39;t leave your name in</text>
  <text start="195.07" dur="6.51">the morning then you go out and get a</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="5.1">cue Asian treatment done and I found a</text>
  <text start="201.58" dur="5.7">facility that does IV chelation the</text>
  <text start="204.25" dur="4.41">purpose for doing this was if I do a</text>
  <text start="207.28" dur="3.929">first morning urine</text>
  <text start="208.66" dur="5.88">it looks at what&amp;#39;s called daily exposure</text>
  <text start="211.209" dur="5.491">i am i exposed to any lead my day to day</text>
  <text start="214.54" dur="4.56">activity but you&amp;#39;re doing the chelation</text>
  <text start="216.7" dur="5.25">drip and then you collect your urine for</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="6.33">the next six hours that looks at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.95" dur="5.28">called body burden that&amp;#39;s how much lead</text>
  <text start="225.43" dur="4.02">i&amp;#39;ve explode we&amp;#39;ve been exposed to</text>
  <text start="227.23" dur="5.94">throughout my entire life he said then</text>
  <text start="229.45" dur="7.8">for the next 90 days three months put</text>
  <text start="233.17" dur="6.45">the cream on and then do the protocol</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="3.78">put the cream on your name do whatever</text>
  <text start="239.62" dur="3.3">you do don&amp;#39;t worry about that just make</text>
  <text start="241.03" dur="3.959">sure you do it for 90 days at the end of</text>
  <text start="242.92" dur="4.26">that period of time redoing the</text>
  <text start="244.989" dur="3.121">experiment with the two urines the first</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="3.21">year in the morning</text>
  <text start="248.11" dur="5.82">then do the drip and click for six hours</text>
  <text start="250.39" dur="5.189">and then do that so i did and i didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="4.29">miss a single night i did it exactly the</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="4.741">way the protocol is so the first two</text>
  <text start="258.22" dur="6.39">urines and i have this in the weekend</text>
  <text start="260.32" dur="6.03">posted later they send back a very</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="4.59">complicated sheet that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="4.8">playings all the different toxic metals</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="5.64">and it&amp;#39;s called the tots of metal urine</text>
  <text start="271.15" dur="5.94">everything from aluminum to uranium is</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="5.04">listed on here and as one might imagine</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="4.92">my morning urine that has nothing else</text>
  <text start="279.88" dur="4.2">just the urine has a certain kind of</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="4.32">listing on that and the ones after the</text>
  <text start="284.08" dur="4.02">drift i&amp;#39;m much high anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.33" dur="4.1">really just thing and i probably can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="288.1" dur="6.63">see here but it goes off the chart no</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="5.86">yeah with live and i thought it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="294.73" dur="3.69">fascinating it would go off the chart to</text>
  <text start="296.29" dur="5.13">live for me because I&amp;#39;ve never done a</text>
  <text start="298.42" dur="4.32">job like welding or something with</text>
  <text start="301.42" dur="2.91">petroleum or anything that I would have</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="2.82">been exposed to a lot of types of metals</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="2.43">I&amp;#39;ve been a health care practitioner</text>
  <text start="305.56" dur="5.94">most of my life</text>
  <text start="306.76" dur="7.23">so after the 90 days I redid it and I</text>
  <text start="311.5" dur="4.77">had the next two sets of Europe and in</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="5.49">each case everything went down and</text>
  <text start="316.27" dur="5.49">what&amp;#39;s fascinating is on the after 6:00</text>
  <text start="319.48" dur="3.9">hour one the lead is not in the red</text>
  <text start="321.76" dur="4.95">anymore it&amp;#39;s down into this yellow</text>
  <text start="323.38" dur="5.46">category which indicates that it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="326.71" dur="4.23">lot of the toxic metals out of my system</text>
  <text start="328.84" dur="5.16">which is really sort of fascinating</text>
  <text start="330.94" dur="5.64">because obviously with one person</text>
  <text start="334" dur="5.07">following the protocols that has done</text>
  <text start="336.58" dur="4.71">that so he gave that information to</text>
  <text start="339.07" dur="3.66">Frank in church and Romney said hey it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341.29" dur="3.66">obviously show you that something is</text>
  <text start="342.73" dur="4.14">happening here but it all just came</text>
  <text start="344.95" dur="4.17">about sort of my chance it was something</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="4.68">my chance and that&amp;#39;s the story that came</text>
  <text start="349.12" dur="4.92">up with with with the work on the q</text>
  <text start="351.55" dur="4.56">nation so now we&amp;#39;re looking at people</text>
  <text start="354.04" dur="3.75">that would benefit from this obviously</text>
  <text start="356.11" dur="3.81">children you know I&amp;#39;m here in the</text>
  <text start="357.79" dur="4.38">Midwest in Chicago but just the next day</text>
  <text start="359.92" dur="3.87">over in Michigan remember there was that</text>
  <text start="362.17" dur="4.17">whole crisis with the lead in the water</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="4.47">and you have all these poor kids that</text>
  <text start="366.34" dur="4.44">are exposed to let it water you could</text>
  <text start="368.26" dur="3.75">put this on at night and then they go to</text>
  <text start="370.78" dur="3.48">sleep and in the morning when they</text>
  <text start="372.01" dur="4.17">urinate they were moving this way and so</text>
  <text start="374.26" dur="3.84">each of the jars they&amp;#39;re changing the</text>
  <text start="376.18" dur="5.37">formula but right now it&amp;#39;s 350</text>
  <text start="378.1" dur="5.55">milligrams of EDTA and there&amp;#39;s no side</text>
  <text start="381.55" dur="3.51">effects the only thing that one has to</text>
  <text start="383.65" dur="3.84">make sure is that they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="5.13">putting back some of the minerals that</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="4.98">are being depleted that we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="390.19" dur="4.26">get rid of and so most of the time</text>
  <text start="392.47" dur="4.68">people that are using chelation whether</text>
  <text start="394.45" dur="4.529">it&amp;#39;s the IV chelation there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="397.15" dur="2.38">suppository chelation as well or trans</text>
  <text start="398.979" dur="2.411">normal</text>
  <text start="399.53" dur="5.58">he&amp;#39;s been replacing the Middle&amp;#39;s other</text>
  <text start="401.39" dur="5.34">that that&amp;#39;s yeah and I actually one of</text>
  <text start="405.11" dur="4.35">my favorite products that suggests is a</text>
  <text start="406.73" dur="5.25">multi mineral product but so for sure</text>
  <text start="409.46" dur="4.05">and that is an interesting thing even</text>
  <text start="411.98" dur="3.6">though it is a study of one it does have</text>
  <text start="413.51" dur="3.36">measurable results to it and frankly you</text>
  <text start="415.58" dur="5.97">may have one of the world&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="416.87" dur="7.47">interesting you&amp;#39;re in there something</text>
  <text start="421.55" dur="4.32">for that as well but I do encourage</text>
  <text start="424.34" dur="2.79">people to look inflation and of course</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s dangerous there&amp;#39;s a lot to know</text>
  <text start="427.13" dur="6.39">about that I&amp;#39;ve done wrong by the</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="4.41">potential suffering alleviated I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="433.52" dur="3.51">think of too many other areas we should</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="5.22">put more focus and then detoxing</text>
  <text start="437.03" dur="4.23">especially the heavy metals I mean I</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="3">think we could actually I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="441.26" dur="3.3">stories I can&amp;#39;t say anything I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="442.97" dur="8.13">stories of you know autism being</text>
  <text start="444.56" dur="8.52">reversed and things like that when I was</text>
  <text start="451.1" dur="4.41">working the chelation facility in the</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="4.86">World Trade Center most of the people</text>
  <text start="455.51" dur="4.62">probably 99% of the people weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="457.94" dur="4.71">getting chelated because of lead</text>
  <text start="460.13" dur="5.07">toxicity they were getting chelated to</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="4.2">increase their circulation because if</text>
  <text start="465.2" dur="5.67">you have problems with your heart and</text>
  <text start="466.85" dur="6.27">there&amp;#39;s occlusions in your coronary</text>
  <text start="470.87" dur="4.5">arteries and which could lead to heart</text>
  <text start="473.12" dur="4.77">attacks etc when I found very</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="5.13">fascinating is everybody can be sitting</text>
  <text start="477.89" dur="4.77">in this large reception area had these</text>
  <text start="480.5" dur="4.29">oblique creases in their earlobes and</text>
  <text start="482.66" dur="4.53">the oblique crease is what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="484.79" dur="5.43">pathognomonic sign for coronary artery</text>
  <text start="487.19" dur="4.83">disease and so I thought how fascinating</text>
  <text start="490.22" dur="3.48">and you can see it yeah I don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="3.33">you have one but if you look at</text>
  <text start="493.7" dur="2.82">alignment Snoozeville crease it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="495.35" dur="2.49">some people</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="5.01">everyone&amp;#39;s filling their ear right now</text>
  <text start="497.84" dur="6.12">hundreds of thousand so curiously I</text>
  <text start="501.53" dur="5.76">would watch people come in who were</text>
  <text start="503.96" dur="6.93">having maybe complications to diabetes</text>
  <text start="507.29" dur="6.119">they were having gangrenous toes and all</text>
  <text start="510.89" dur="4.829">kinds of shortness of breath we&amp;#39;d sit</text>
  <text start="513.409" dur="4.741">there and drip them and then over a</text>
  <text start="515.719" dur="4.5">number of weeks or months their toes</text>
  <text start="518.15" dur="4.71">turned pink again their circulation was</text>
  <text start="520.219" dur="4.741">better their cognition was better was</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="5.43">been amazing so it wasn&amp;#39;t because of the</text>
  <text start="524.96" dur="4.52">lead it was that the chelation was also</text>
  <text start="528.29" dur="4.28">moving the calcium</text>
  <text start="529.48" dur="5.28">that was acting like cement inside the</text>
  <text start="532.57" dur="4.68">plaque inside the coronary arteries and</text>
  <text start="534.76" dur="3.87">so all this was being fleshed out so we</text>
  <text start="537.25" dur="4.11">would always check to make sure that</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="4.8">adequate renal function their kidneys</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="4.23">were working well but they weren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="543.43" dur="4.35">doing it for the lid so we weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="545.59" dur="4.02">kidding around about the idea that if</text>
  <text start="547.78" dur="3.96">one is doing this they&amp;#39;re sort of</text>
  <text start="549.61" dur="3.96">reversing the aging process because what</text>
  <text start="551.74" dur="5.22">happens as you get older you get more</text>
  <text start="553.57" dur="5.34">and more material that&amp;#39;s depositing in</text>
  <text start="556.96" dur="6.06">your blood vessels and this is removing</text>
  <text start="558.91" dur="8.07">that so it&amp;#39;s really kind of a great you</text>
  <text start="563.02" dur="5.91">know I I came to to that same sort of</text>
  <text start="566.98" dur="4.2">approach of cleaning up the blood and</text>
  <text start="568.93" dur="4.11">the vessels and the heart even from the</text>
  <text start="571.18" dur="4.32">calcium buildup but I sort of approached</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="4.02">it from trying to detox the third I</text>
  <text start="575.5" dur="3.75">liked the pineal gland of all the</text>
  <text start="577.06" dur="4.98">fluoride and I came through it through</text>
  <text start="579.25" dur="4.59">things like you know rock a cow and and</text>
  <text start="582.04" dur="4.68">I eventually settled my favorite was</text>
  <text start="583.84" dur="6.09">just regular old borax for the boron</text>

  <text start="589.93" dur="3.81">balancing your magnesium and your boron</text>
  <text start="592.06" dur="3.48">everything else you can you can help to</text>
  <text start="593.74" dur="3.81">do a lot of that just through through</text>
  <text start="595.54" dur="3.3">traditional supplements but I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="2.79">even know chelation you could do that</text>
  <text start="598.84" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s super cool so there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="600.34" dur="4.29">synergistic effects and these different</text>
  <text start="602.26" dur="9.24">you know alternative treatments well I</text>
  <text start="604.63" dur="11.34">got so into this issue of the American</text>
  <text start="611.5" dur="6.18">chiropractor and it&amp;#39;s talking about what</text>
  <text start="615.97" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re saying in addition to chelation</text>
  <text start="617.68" dur="6.36">what else could someone do whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="619.9" dur="6.99">saunas or dry brushing or herbs or</text>
  <text start="624.04" dur="4.53">certain nutrients so it&amp;#39;s just when you</text>
  <text start="626.89" dur="4.53">start investigating this there&amp;#39;s lots</text>
  <text start="628.57" dur="4.44">and lots of that out there so maybe you</text>
  <text start="631.42" dur="4.59">can create a link afterwards at some</text>
  <text start="633.01" dur="4.35">point I&amp;#39;ll um I will I wish you good</text>
  <text start="636.01" dur="2.67">luck in getting through anything in it</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="2.76">like a traditional medical journal</text>
  <text start="638.68" dur="6.36">that&amp;#39;s alternative lights</text>
  <text start="640.12" dur="6.33">I hope so actually you know what I would</text>
  <text start="645.04" dur="2.88">love to bring them on board something</text>
  <text start="646.45" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;m putting together there&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="647.92" dur="6.45">bit of talk of a networking sort of an</text>
  <text start="652.18" dur="4.38">unsensible independent peer-reviewed</text>
  <text start="654.37" dur="4.56">medical journal that has a little bit of</text>
  <text start="656.56" dur="3.63">funding behind it to actually push</text>
  <text start="658.93" dur="4.24">through some of these things like</text>
  <text start="660.19" dur="4.93">vitamin C&amp;#39;s and then simple treatments</text>
  <text start="663.17" dur="4.62">who knows right I mean that&amp;#39;s what would</text>
  <text start="665.12" dur="5.67">be possible I think a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="667.79" dur="4.74">open to alternative therapies in the</text>
  <text start="670.79" dur="4.53">facility that I was working on we used</text>
  <text start="672.53" dur="5.82">to do a vitamin C IV drips about 16 7 5</text>
  <text start="675.32" dur="6.54">grams of vitamin C for people with mono</text>

  <text start="681.86" dur="5.16">bunch of people saying you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="683.96" dur="4.98">know that the traditional way is for</text>
  <text start="687.02" dur="5.22">everybody I mean you see in the news all</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="5.31">the time right now yeah well but the</text>
  <text start="692.24" dur="3.63">thing is that we now we have to figure</text>
  <text start="694.25" dur="3.45">out a way to stop the behemoth that</text>
  <text start="695.87" dur="4.59">controls everything with Big Pharma I</text>
  <text start="697.7" dur="5.28">mean that everyone that tries and I</text>
  <text start="700.46" dur="4.44">figured it out one way of at least</text>
  <text start="702.98" dur="4.17">addressing some sort of a decentralized</text>
  <text start="704.9" dur="4.08">you know platform where people could get</text>
  <text start="707.15" dur="4.05">out the research and have some funding</text>
  <text start="708.98" dur="4.92">but that&amp;#39;s gonna take a lot more than</text>
  <text start="711.2" dur="4.53">just me and and actually you know</text>
  <text start="713.9" dur="3.27">between us and the folks were watching</text>
  <text start="715.73" dur="12.12">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of interest behind</text>
  <text start="717.17" dur="14.55">that idea so it&amp;#39;s great thing they can</text>
  <text start="727.85" dur="7.46">go off on their own and start for sure</text>
  <text start="731.72" dur="6.33">yeah you hear my little one in there oh</text>
  <text start="735.31" dur="3.55">so where you gonna take this now I mean</text>
  <text start="738.05" dur="2.79">you&amp;#39;re gonna obviously you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="738.86" dur="5.07">gonna continue this and just suppress</text>
  <text start="740.84" dur="5.79">your lead down to nothing right go out</text>
  <text start="743.93" dur="4.26">at least for six months so I&amp;#39;m taking in</text>
  <text start="746.63" dur="4.59">another three months and I&amp;#39;ll do another</text>
  <text start="748.19" dur="5.58">drip and have my third workup on the</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="4.8">urines just to see if it goes down even</text>
  <text start="753.77" dur="4.83">lower and to be very curious to find out</text>
  <text start="756.02" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;d love to do this with some people who</text>
  <text start="758.6" dur="3.42">are who have much more exposure than I</text>
  <text start="760.82" dur="3.3">do</text>
  <text start="762.02" dur="4.89">my daughter is marrying a guy whose</text>
  <text start="764.12" dur="5.13">father is a welder I&amp;#39;d love to check to</text>
  <text start="766.91" dur="5.01">see how much Letty&amp;#39;s is close to even a</text>

  <text start="771.92" dur="3.63">have hobbies of making stained-glass</text>
  <text start="773.45" dur="4.2">windows you know or any family were</text>
  <text start="775.55" dur="4.26">exposed to constant amounts of toxic</text>
  <text start="777.65" dur="3.75">metals and the seasons of how that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="779.81" dur="4.56">going on and I&amp;#39;ve been kicking around</text>
  <text start="781.4" dur="4.32">ideas with Frank about other ways of</text>
  <text start="784.37" dur="3.6">going with direction but I think for</text>
  <text start="785.72" dur="5.76">myself I&amp;#39;m going to definitely do it you</text>
  <text start="787.97" dur="5.73">know for the full six months you know</text>
  <text start="791.48" dur="4.05">and and maybe I should ask kind of what</text>
  <text start="793.7" dur="2.87">this might cost someone to do because</text>
  <text start="795.53" dur="2.6">there may be even</text>
  <text start="796.57" dur="3.51">just in a large city you know the</text>
  <text start="798.13" dur="3.57">plumbing is bad like Flint was just sort</text>
  <text start="800.08" dur="3.57">of an example not even the worst it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="801.7" dur="5.22">out there but we heard about that one</text>
  <text start="803.65" dur="4.8">fortunately what if people wanted to do</text>
  <text start="806.92" dur="3.15">this sort of thing maybe send in their</text>
  <text start="808.45" dur="3.09">results or show up and do interviews or</text>
  <text start="810.07" dur="3">something like that and copy this is</text>
  <text start="811.54" dur="7.29">that something that is it is it</text>
  <text start="813.07" dur="7.65">affordable yet yes when I was looking at</text>
  <text start="818.83" dur="4.98">the cost of doing the intravenous</text>
  <text start="820.72" dur="4.62">chelation there was $200 so you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="823.81" dur="2.88">this chair and dripping for two and a</text>
  <text start="825.34" dur="3.99">half to three hours and it&amp;#39;s doing the</text>
  <text start="826.69" dur="5.34">bucks and clearly that&amp;#39;s not affordable</text>
  <text start="829.33" dur="5.28">for everybody the cream is about seventy</text>
  <text start="832.03" dur="4.77">eight seventy nine dollars and it lasts</text>
  <text start="834.61" dur="3.66">about a month and so that&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="836.8" dur="7.77">spreading that over it&amp;#39;s considerably</text>
  <text start="838.27" dur="8.07">more affordable oh yeah I definitely</text>
  <text start="844.57" dur="3.84">carry this because I was looking for an</text>
  <text start="846.34" dur="4.53">EDTA cream specifically in a cream form</text>
  <text start="848.41" dur="4.35">so I found these guys with that yeah no</text>
  <text start="850.87" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m saying that it does become</text>
  <text start="852.76" dur="6.21">considerably more affordable to look at</text>
  <text start="855.01" dur="6.51">that way I think to your point there was</text>
  <text start="858.97" dur="6.57">a lot of articles recently in Chicago</text>
  <text start="861.52" dur="5.73">that there were plumbers even back in</text>
  <text start="865.54" dur="4.74">the 60s who knew that it was dangerous</text>
  <text start="867.25" dur="7.35">to use you know led soldering the pipes</text>
  <text start="870.28" dur="5.79">but because of some collusion and stuff</text>
  <text start="874.6" dur="4.2">going on with Mayor Daley we did it</text>
  <text start="876.07" dur="4.53">anyway and so I think if one has the</text>
  <text start="878.8" dur="3.3">ability to filter their water it</text>
  <text start="880.6" dur="5.37">probably makes a great deal of sense to</text>
  <text start="882.1" dur="5.94">do that minimize heat is a must-have I</text>
  <text start="885.97" dur="4.2">mean I would do that before I would take</text>
  <text start="888.04" dur="3.42">a trip or go to a movie or do anything</text>
  <text start="890.17" dur="2.85">for personal pleasure that is a</text>
  <text start="891.46" dur="4.95">must-have for your health long-term</text>
  <text start="893.02" dur="4.5">suffering everything I will you know I</text>
  <text start="896.41" dur="2.46">will mention since we&amp;#39;re all on the</text>
  <text start="897.52" dur="3.24">topic I did a really fascinating</text>
  <text start="898.87" dur="3.81">interview one time with that dr.</text>
  <text start="900.76" dur="4.26">Christopher shade about some of the</text>
  <text start="902.68" dur="4.83">collation work he&amp;#39;s done and you know</text>
  <text start="905.02" dur="5.34">this EDTA cream is very strong for lead</text>
  <text start="907.51" dur="4.2">but it&amp;#39;s very weak in mercury I was</text>
  <text start="910.36" dur="3.24">trying to figure out ways that we can</text>
  <text start="911.71" dur="4.68">hit it all at different different angles</text>
  <text start="913.6" dur="6.18">and I I like to do things DIY when I can</text>
  <text start="916.39" dur="5.13">and save money and he actually in the</text>
  <text start="919.78" dur="3.54">video listed a recipe out for some</text>
  <text start="921.52" dur="3.69">different extracts and bitters and such</text>
  <text start="923.32" dur="5.04">that can sort of prep the organs and</text>
  <text start="925.21" dur="4.58">help with the detox combined with you</text>
  <text start="928.36" dur="3.77">know the bentonite clay and</text>
  <text start="929.79" dur="6.36">and some of the activated charcoal and</text>
  <text start="932.13" dur="5.88">then of course glutathione probably like</text>
  <text start="936.15" dur="3.78">the liposomal glutathione these are some</text>
  <text start="938.01" dur="3.57">he has his own thing of course it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="939.93" dur="3.51">more expensive but there&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="941.58" dur="3.84">ways that you could hit different metals</text>
  <text start="943.44" dur="3.51">and things within your diet within sort</text>
  <text start="945.42" dur="3.15">of life it&amp;#39;s almost within the drift</text>
  <text start="946.95" dur="2.33">method if you can find someone to help</text>
  <text start="948.57" dur="4.98">you</text>
  <text start="949.28" dur="6.43">well what&amp;#39;s curious to me is I did a lot</text>
  <text start="953.55" dur="4.11">of research on the mercury as well and I</text>
  <text start="955.71" dur="3.9">agree with you that the EDTA although it</text>
  <text start="957.66" dur="4.71">does have an effect is not one of the</text>
  <text start="959.61" dur="6.45">better commands for mercury and yet with</text>
  <text start="962.37" dur="6.66">my results my mercury went way down I</text>
  <text start="966.06" dur="11.01">could so what impressed so on the 6-hour</text>
  <text start="969.03" dur="9.42">one on my first mercury CI anyway the</text>
  <text start="977.07" dur="3.54">numbers are down on mercury I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="978.45" dur="3.81">how that happens but it&amp;#39;s like I said it</text>
  <text start="980.61" dur="3.3">doesn&amp;#39;t it does chelate somewhere</text>
  <text start="982.26" dur="4.47">throughout and there&amp;#39;s another couple of</text>
  <text start="983.91" dur="4.8">products dmsa it also has an effect on</text>
  <text start="986.73" dur="4.65">mercury so i think when someone does the</text>
  <text start="988.71" dur="4.8">research they can&amp;#39;t find alternatives I</text>
  <text start="991.38" dur="3.99">was just curious because I had had the</text>
  <text start="993.51" dur="3.72">experience in the past of working with</text>
  <text start="995.37" dur="3.33">it intravenously to know that they now</text>
  <text start="997.23" dur="3">have agreed with those in the trans</text>
  <text start="998.7" dur="9.57">donor which is kind of fun</text>
  <text start="1000.23" dur="9.27">I don&amp;#39;t like may have lost your bottom I</text>
  <text start="1008.27" dur="2.66">had my meat on there and do that</text>
  <text start="1009.5" dur="4.44">sometimes</text>
  <text start="1010.93" dur="5.05">speaking of intravenously I grew up some</text>
  <text start="1013.94" dur="4.32">sort of on those stories of like the</text>
  <text start="1015.98" dur="3.99">vitamin C intravenous trips and some of</text>
  <text start="1018.26" dur="4.14">the things that that was helping</text>
  <text start="1019.97" dur="4.68">alleviate for lack of better words that</text>
  <text start="1022.4" dur="3.75">might get me you know in trouble but you</text>
  <text start="1024.65" dur="3.96">know they were using words like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1026.15" dur="3.78">and things like that and and they were</text>
  <text start="1028.61" dur="3.96">getting some pretty interesting results</text>
  <text start="1029.93" dur="4.56">with just vitamin C intravenously and</text>
  <text start="1032.57" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s incredibly difficult to even get</text>
  <text start="1034.49" dur="3.72">even though that&amp;#39;s fairly cheap any sort</text>
  <text start="1036.5" dur="2.01">of mainstream medical type to agree to</text>
  <text start="1038.21" dur="3.48">that</text>
  <text start="1038.51" dur="4.92">so it was almost like a solution that</text>
  <text start="1041.69" dur="5.16">was shelved that&amp;#39;s in plain sight for</text>
  <text start="1043.43" dur="5.19">folks and then now we have liposomal</text>
  <text start="1046.85" dur="4.53">vitamins which i think is sort of very</text>
  <text start="1048.62" dur="6.3">exciting because you can almost parallel</text>
  <text start="1051.38" dur="6.24">even an intravenous dosage with the form</text>
  <text start="1054.92" dur="3.63">of you know liposomal so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1057.62" dur="2.7">a lot of different things out there</text>
  <text start="1058.55" dur="4.86">where if we could get the funding to</text>
  <text start="1060.32" dur="6.03">study that we could really push you</text>
  <text start="1063.41" dur="5.04">cost solutions on the market well there</text>
  <text start="1066.35" dur="5.01">are alternative therapists depending</text>
  <text start="1068.45" dur="5.37">upon the state laws then do a lot of</text>
  <text start="1071.36" dur="4.5">these therapies the facility where I had</text>
  <text start="1073.82" dur="3.54">this done I know they do vitamin C drips</text>
  <text start="1075.86" dur="4.74">because the woman in five people was</text>
  <text start="1077.36" dur="4.95">having a pregnancy driven EDTA I was</text>
  <text start="1080.6" dur="3.27">racing her and they said to me</text>
  <text start="1082.31" dur="3.69">you don&amp;#39;t race somebody with my I would</text>
  <text start="1083.87" dur="4.8">see you let yours drip a lot slower so I</text>
  <text start="1086" dur="5.52">said good to know but ultimately like in</text>
  <text start="1088.67" dur="5.88">the old days we did do vitamin C drip</text>
  <text start="1091.52" dur="5.1">what was curious about the vitamin C was</text>
  <text start="1094.55" dur="4.56">there was a way to test one vitamin C</text>
  <text start="1096.62" dur="5.82">status by dropping a dye on the tongue</text>
  <text start="1099.11" dur="5.49">and it turned blue and if the vitamin C</text>
  <text start="1102.44" dur="4.44">was present in the tissues it would turn</text>
  <text start="1104.6" dur="4.47">from blue the clear and the month the</text>
  <text start="1106.88" dur="4.44">more vitamin C that a person had the</text>
  <text start="1109.07" dur="4.44">faster it went from blue to clear and I</text>
  <text start="1111.32" dur="5.31">remember once we dripped somebody who</text>
  <text start="1113.51" dur="6.24">was adrenal e insufficient and exhausted</text>
  <text start="1116.63" dur="5.1">and I put the vitamin C on the on the</text>
  <text start="1119.75" dur="3.81">tongue and it took 60 seconds and it</text>
  <text start="1121.73" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t disappear at all then we hooked</text>
  <text start="1123.56" dur="3.57">her up to a vitamin C drip and the next</text>
  <text start="1125.69" dur="3.09">day when she came in we did it and was</text>
  <text start="1127.13" dur="3.21">about 30 seconds and then we did one</text>
  <text start="1128.78" dur="5.25">more vitamin C drip and we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1130.34" dur="6.32">about 60 to 70 grams 60,000 milligrams</text>
  <text start="1134.03" dur="4.95">of vitamin C and by the second drip</text>
  <text start="1136.66" dur="4.99">instantaneously went from blue to clear</text>
  <text start="1138.98" dur="4.35">so this is a woman who was so deficient</text>
  <text start="1141.65" dur="4.5">in vitamin C but it took me the</text>
  <text start="1143.33" dur="5.07">equivalent about 120,000 milligrams of</text>
  <text start="1146.15" dur="3.72">vitamin C to bring that back so there</text>
  <text start="1148.4" dur="4.14">are a lot of people out there who are</text>
  <text start="1149.87" dur="4.44">under chronic stress that would benefit</text>
  <text start="1152.54" dur="4.73">from that but there are there are places</text>
  <text start="1154.31" dur="5.58">that do this I think one has</text>
  <text start="1157.27" dur="7.45">wow so I&amp;#39;m a little bit less pessimistic</text>
  <text start="1159.89" dur="6.33">after that and with the system I sort of</text>
  <text start="1164.72" dur="3.45">I was trying to find solutions that</text>
