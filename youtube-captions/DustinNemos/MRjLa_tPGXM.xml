  <text start="1899.13" dur="6.88">disassociate with them and this is where</text>
  <text start="1903.94" dur="3.989">you like maybe maybe you would publicly</text>
  <text start="1906.01" dur="4.26">shame them or you would just choose to</text>
  <text start="1907.929" dur="4.681">to get away from them kind of like the</text>
  <text start="1910.27" dur="4.399">crab in the bucket and you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>

  <text start="1914.669" dur="4.571">that&amp;#39;s the better option I think because</text>
  <text start="1917.11" dur="5.15">that&amp;#39;s a non-violent option and shaming</text>
  <text start="1919.24" dur="5.28">is how you prevent violence and culture</text>

  <text start="2528.48" dur="3.57">done it says explain why a GMO is bad to</text>
  <text start="2530.61" dur="4.11">me I have a family they&amp;#39;re farmers so</text>
  <text start="2532.05" dur="4.2">the short version is that in nature and</text>
  <text start="2534.72" dur="3.96">this is how they describe it as but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2536.25" dur="4.74">not in nature you can cross pollinate</text>
  <text start="2538.68" dur="5.34">for example two different strains of</text>
  <text start="2540.99" dur="4.56">tomatoes or maybe maybe like a hyena and</text>
  <text start="2544.02" dur="3.15">a dog if you get really lucky you might</text>
  <text start="2545.55" dur="3.54">actually have that tape because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2547.17" dur="3.57">sort of distantly related I guess maybe</text>
  <text start="2549.09" dur="4.02">right like and that&amp;#39;s a bad example it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2550.74" dur="4.98">probably not but like a dog in a wolf</text>
  <text start="2553.11" dur="5.58">for example could happen probably</text>
  <text start="2555.72" dur="4.41">wouldn&amp;#39;t but could happen now what</text>
  <text start="2558.69" dur="7.44">they&amp;#39;re doing with GMOs it&amp;#39;s more like a</text>
  <text start="2560.13" dur="7.23">spider and a squid and a tomato that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2566.13" dur="4.53">completely different problem which</text>
  <text start="2567.36" dur="6.6">causes all sorts of unknown mutations so</text>
  <text start="2570.66" dur="5.82">for example within the first generation</text>
  <text start="2573.96" dur="3.93">of eating the GMO corn some of the rat</text>
  <text start="2576.48" dur="2.91">studies they&amp;#39;ve done I think it was</text>
  <text start="2577.89" dur="4.26">Institute for Responsible technology if</text>
  <text start="2579.39" dur="5.04">I recall correctly some of those studies</text>
  <text start="2582.15" dur="4.77">where the first generation of rat would</text>
  <text start="2584.43" dur="4.05">just get cancer more likely the second</text>
  <text start="2586.92" dur="3.39">generation would be born with lower</text>
  <text start="2588.48" dur="2.629">birth weights and then would get cancer</text>
  <text start="2590.31" dur="2.39">far more likely</text>
  <text start="2591.109" dur="3.24">like huge tumors things like that would</text>
  <text start="2592.7" dur="4.2">have bigger problems and died earlier</text>
  <text start="2594.349" dur="4.621">and the third generation if it was born</text>
  <text start="2596.9" dur="3.449">alive of his many of them were stillborn</text>
  <text start="2598.97" dur="3.869">would be born with things like hair</text>
  <text start="2600.349" dur="5.611">growing in its mouth massive tumors</text>
  <text start="2602.839" dur="5.46">wouldn&amp;#39;t live very long things like that</text>
  <text start="2605.96" dur="4.589">so in nature like animals will actually</text>
  <text start="2608.299" dur="4.651">avoid GMO food if there&amp;#39;s another option</text>
  <text start="2610.549" dur="5.51">you can test this yourself by leaving a</text>
  <text start="2612.95" dur="5.129">big bag of corn in a big bag of GMO corn</text>
  <text start="2616.059" dur="5.43">somewhere that rats will get to it or</text>
  <text start="2618.079" dur="3.41">something and see which one they pick</text>
  <text start="2622.089" dur="13.351">animals no sorry so I might be missing</text>
  <text start="2632.66" dur="2.78">some questions</text>
  <text start="2642.54" dur="7.13">anyone who&amp;#39;s smart has a kill switch</text>
  <text start="2644.43" dur="5.24">Rockman I set up five of them this week</text>
  <text start="2662.03" dur="7.21">if it happens it happens in war there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2667.23" dur="5.37">a risk to leading from the front and</text>
  <text start="2669.24" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s that you get killed but the gain</text>
  <text start="2672.6" dur="5.93">is that people will respect you for it</text>
  <text start="2674.46" dur="8.49">and maybe just maybe fight beside you</text>
  <text start="2678.53" dur="6.76">I&amp;#39;m netting a lot on that but I didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="3916.08" dur="2.88">say that that&amp;#39;s a violent threat maybe</text>
  <text start="3917.67" dur="3.21">not because he didn&amp;#39;t use my name</text>
  <text start="3918.96" dur="3.18">although I think that there&amp;#39;s a strong</text>
  <text start="3920.88" dur="3.42">case that we could make that he did</text>
  <text start="3922.14" dur="4.65">indeed violently threatened me even in a</text>

  <text start="3929.6" dur="5.74">and it&amp;#39;s a very telling that he muted it</text>
  <text start="3933.15" dur="4.83">out isn&amp;#39;t it and I actually got the clip</text>
  <text start="3935.34" dur="4.41">and show both before and after so you</text>
  <text start="3937.98" dur="4.83">can see that Alex Jones thing where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3939.75" dur="4.32">like and then it&amp;#39;s like Japanese lips</text>
  <text start="3942.81" dur="3">like when the heroes you&amp;#39;re seeing the</text>

  <text start="3985.92" dur="2.33">what&amp;#39;s the point</text>
  <text start="3988.4" dur="7.57">it&amp;#39;s probably just waste of time like an</text>

  <text start="4013.309" dur="2.881">not using my name which i think was just</text>
  <text start="4014.69" dur="4.53">trying to be dishonorable and not drive</text>
  <text start="4016.19" dur="5.01">people to me because clearly the pattern</text>
  <text start="4019.22" dur="4.5">is there like I got him dead to rights</text>
  <text start="4021.2" dur="4.68">with direct quotations and stuff so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4023.72" dur="3.78">not like he could deny it truly I I</text>
  <text start="4025.88" dur="2.61">wonder whether or not he&amp;#39;ll eventually</text>
  <text start="4027.5" dur="3.65">come out and admit that he&amp;#39;s been</text>
