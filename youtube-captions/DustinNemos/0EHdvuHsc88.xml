  <text start="36.46" dur="5.099">here we go we&amp;#39;re gonna go through quick</text>
  <text start="38.5" dur="4.41">so kind of humorous kind of relevant to</text>
  <text start="41.559" dur="3.42">what&amp;#39;s going on with Trump&amp;#39;s recent</text>
  <text start="42.91" dur="3.81">remark that he would have ran in and</text>
  <text start="44.979" dur="4.021">stopped the shooter even if he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="46.72" dur="5.79">have a gun well it turns out he actually</text>
  <text start="49" dur="6.69">did stop an attacker once at least that</text>
  <text start="52.51" dur="6.859">we know of November 20th 1991 a</text>
  <text start="55.69" dur="6.329">newspaper article in The Daily News</text>
  <text start="59.369" dur="6.221">article by James Rosen was called</text>
  <text start="62.019" dur="5.551">muggers trumped Donald stops attack so</text>
  <text start="65.59" dur="2.849">basically this guy was mugging somebody</text>
  <text start="67.57" dur="2.939">with a baseball bat</text>
  <text start="68.439" dur="5.36">Trump pulled over had his driver stopped</text>
  <text start="70.509" dur="3.29">and he got out and told him stop</text>
  <text start="75.09" dur="5.23">apparently the mugger said mr. Trump I</text>
  <text start="78.31" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong and Trump</text>
  <text start="80.32" dur="3.81">replied how could you not do anything</text>
  <text start="82" dur="4.2">when you&amp;#39;re whacking the guy with a bat</text>
  <text start="84.13" dur="5.07">and then the mugger ran away there were</text>
  <text start="86.2" dur="4.68">witnesses and everything okay now here</text>
  <text start="89.2" dur="5.3">is a bigger piece that that was humor</text>
  <text start="90.88" dur="5.73">but this is this is more serious so</text>
  <text start="94.5" dur="3.97">there was an article in true planet</text>
  <text start="96.61" dur="3.54">called why does the media care more</text>
  <text start="98.47" dur="3.45">about the parkland shooting than it ever</text>
  <text start="100.15" dur="3.21">did about Las Vegas it brings up a very</text>
  <text start="101.92" dur="6.36">interesting point I&amp;#39;ve touched on this</text>
  <text start="103.36" dur="7.56">in the past as well so we know that a</text>
  <text start="108.28" dur="4.65">quick comparison the Parkland shooting</text>

  <text start="876.66" dur="6">not racist in any means but there is</text>
  <text start="880.68" dur="3.69">definitely an issue with culture in this</text>
  <text start="882.66" dur="5.82">world and I think culture really does</text>
  <text start="884.37" dur="7.29">matter and to kind of ignore that and</text>
  <text start="888.48" dur="7.29">just say all cultures are equal or all</text>
  <text start="891.66" dur="7.86">ideas are equal or you know all people</text>
  <text start="895.77" dur="7.25">should be able to come and live in our</text>

  <text start="928.94" dur="6.3">right anyway I will so we&amp;#39;ll move on to</text>
  <text start="933.62" dur="3.66">the next topic it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning</text>
  <text start="935.24" dur="7.79">because the Muslim issue is a much</text>
  <text start="937.28" dur="9.78">bigger topic to go into another time now</text>
  <text start="943.03" dur="5.86">and before I move on it&amp;#39;s the point of</text>
  <text start="947.06" dur="4.5">me saying that is because it&amp;#39;s gotten so</text>
  <text start="948.89" dur="4.83">bad in Europe that even the left leaders</text>

  <text start="2320.28" dur="4.89">the shooting now here&amp;#39;s the interesting</text>
  <text start="2323.19" dur="4.41">thing about that right now he has a</text>
  <text start="2325.17" dur="4.08">public defender pretty sure he shows up</text>
  <text start="2327.6" dur="3.15">to court drugged and he can&amp;#39;t talk and</text>
  <text start="2329.25" dur="3.12">he just he&amp;#39;s going along with his own</text>
  <text start="2330.75" dur="3.06">death sentence basically or life</text>
  <text start="2332.37" dur="2.37">imprisonment sentence of whatever does</text>
  <text start="2333.81" dur="3.27">they gave him because he&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="2334.74" dur="4.38">doped up just like he was when he got</text>
  <text start="2337.08" dur="4.95">into that police car remember he was</text>
  <text start="2339.12" dur="5.55">kind of nodding off and falling over</text>
  <text start="2342.03" dur="5.43">like somebody that&amp;#39;s on heavy drugs I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2344.67" dur="4.35">seen it firsthand with my brother when</text>
  <text start="2347.46" dur="4.29">he was on heroin he would he would pass</text>
  <text start="2349.02" dur="6.09">out and mid-conversation slowly nod off</text>
  <text start="2351.75" dur="5.67">like this and then as he would rule and</text>
  <text start="2355.11" dur="4.36">he&amp;#39;d fall over</text>
  <text start="2357.42" dur="4.06">that&amp;#39;s what that kid looked like getting</text>
  <text start="2359.47" dur="5.97">in the car they had they had stuck him</text>
  <text start="2361.48" dur="5.43">full of something in my opinion and I</text>
  <text start="2365.44" dur="3.74">think that that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="2366.91" dur="4.56">courtroom which would mean by necessity</text>
  <text start="2369.18" dur="4.75">obviously that his public defender was</text>
  <text start="2371.47" dur="4.5">part of this conspiracy which I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="2373.93" dur="2.49">saying it could happen I don&amp;#39;t know for</text>
  <text start="2375.97" dur="4.68">sure</text>
  <text start="2376.42" dur="6.54">however my theory on this is this if he</text>
  <text start="2380.65" dur="4.32">were to gain access to his money and now</text>
  <text start="2382.96" dur="4.59">the judge has said that the lawyer he</text>
  <text start="2384.97" dur="5.58">actually had hired for this $800,000</text>
  <text start="2387.55" dur="4.83">inheritance is allowed to see him and</text>
  <text start="2390.55" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re not the public defender&amp;#39;s office</text>
  <text start="2392.38" dur="5.73">is not allowed to stop him or stop her I</text>
  <text start="2394.66" dur="5.22">think it&amp;#39;s a female so if if she can</text>
  <text start="2398.11" dur="3.87">come in and represent him and he can</text>
  <text start="2399.88" dur="4.05">earn he can get his $800,000 inheritance</text>
  <text start="2401.98" dur="6.36">which is his money and the reason that</text>
  <text start="2403.93" dur="7.98">he shouldn&amp;#39;t he will lose his public</text>
  <text start="2408.34" dur="6.24">defender under Florida law if he has</text>
  <text start="2411.91" dur="4.11">more than $2,500 worth of assets and you</text>
  <text start="2414.58" dur="3.42">know not including a home and vehicle</text>
  <text start="2416.02" dur="7.08">he&amp;#39;s not eligible to receive free legal</text>
  <text start="2418" dur="8.07">representation from the county so if</text>
  <text start="2423.1" dur="5.13">just just thought if the attorney is in</text>
  <text start="2426.07" dur="5.27">on whatever&amp;#39;s going on because obviously</text>
  <text start="2428.23" dur="5.63">if he&amp;#39;s clearly drugged from within jail</text>
  <text start="2431.34" dur="10.84">every time he goes to the court hearing</text>
  <text start="2433.86" dur="12.46">she would obviously know then if he were</text>
  <text start="2442.18" dur="6.57">to speak to his other attorney get this</text>
  <text start="2446.32" dur="4.62">money she would basically be fired the</text>
  <text start="2448.75" dur="4.59">the public defender he would be able to</text>
  <text start="2450.94" dur="5.16">get a real attorney who may or may not</text>
  <text start="2453.34" dur="4.74">be involved in this conspiracy or</text>
  <text start="2456.1" dur="3.84">whatever you want to call it who may</text>
  <text start="2458.08" dur="6.12">actually try to represent him honestly</text>
  <text start="2459.94" dur="5.88">like hey I didn&amp;#39;t shoot anyone I had</text>
  <text start="2464.2" dur="3.92">witnesses seeing me while the other</text>
  <text start="2465.82" dur="5.6">shooter was actually shooting people I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2468.12" dur="3.3">being set up</text>
  <text start="2473.16" dur="5.8">obviously that will never happen they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2474.97" dur="9.599">kill someone first I would be very very</text>
  <text start="2478.96" dur="12.42">careful if I were that attorney just a</text>
  <text start="2484.569" dur="9.75">thought okay yeah you know what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2491.38" dur="4.409">it folks I&amp;#39;m gonna do a separate video</text>
