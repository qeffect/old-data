  <text start="548.52" dur="3.66">like a law enforcement term for nowhere</text>
  <text start="550.68" dur="3.72">by design like this thing is being</text>

  <text start="568.08" dur="5.73">this video gets out we will already know</text>
  <text start="569.81" dur="5.83">of course this is a big surprise I would</text>
  <text start="573.81" dur="3.78">not be surprised if this is another case</text>
  <text start="575.64" dur="4.11">of a couple of rockets with zero damage</text>
  <text start="577.59" dur="3.93">zero casualties and probably no one even</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="4.31">saw it you know that&amp;#39;s the kind of</text>
  <text start="581.52" dur="4.92">things we&amp;#39;re seeing in Israel lately so</text>
  <text start="584.06" dur="3.85">it&amp;#39;s fairly difficult for anybody to</text>
  <text start="586.44" dur="3.42">actually hit them with anything because</text>
  <text start="587.91" dur="4.17">they just they&amp;#39;re pretty aggressive in</text>

  <text start="717.71" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s more useful it has smart</text>
  <text start="719.36" dur="5.07">contracts it&amp;#39;s not just used as a</text>
  <text start="721.04" dur="5.46">currency but it&amp;#39;s also used as a</text>

  <text start="726.5" dur="5.19">built on it&amp;#39;s a little complicated but</text>
  <text start="728.45" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s a more advanced technology in</text>

  <text start="738.83" dur="5.22">in terms of market cap and and and</text>
  <text start="741.29" dur="3.57">dollar value but you know it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="744.05" dur="3.81">continue to grow</text>
  <text start="744.86" dur="5.28">on Bitcoin and at the same time Yass</text>
  <text start="747.86" dur="3.9">which is the the one I&amp;#39;ve been heavily</text>
  <text start="750.14" dur="4.44">invested in lately and have been doing</text>
  <text start="751.76" dur="5.46">very well on is nicknamed the etherium</text>

  <text start="762.77" dur="3.84">up-and-coming contender for market share</text>
  <text start="764.75" dur="4.68">dominance in the crypto market which</text>
  <text start="766.61" dur="4.68">itself as I&amp;#39;ve said is a hugely upside</text>
  <text start="769.43" dur="4.74">potential and exponentially growing</text>
  <text start="771.29" dur="5.91">field ok so watch out for eos this</text>
  <text start="774.17" dur="5.97">network is gonna grow and worth</text>
  <text start="777.2" dur="4.65">mentioning some of the things</text>
  <text start="780.14" dur="3.99">that are a little bit different about</text>
  <text start="781.85" dur="5.31">this one it&amp;#39;s free to send funds on okay</text>
  <text start="784.13" dur="5.34">so that&amp;#39;s a huge advantage over any of</text>
  <text start="787.16" dur="3.84">the other points okay bitcoins a little</text>
  <text start="789.47" dur="2.79">expensive to send funds on and some of</text>
  <text start="791" dur="4.38">the other points are actually very cheap</text>
  <text start="792.26" dur="6.15">he o is way faster scales better and is</text>
  <text start="795.38" dur="5.55">free to set the ones on and if you own</text>
  <text start="798.41" dur="4.29">the coins whenever you know there&amp;#39;s ways</text>
  <text start="800.93" dur="3.3">that you can actually gain value just</text>
  <text start="802.7" dur="3.12">from owning the coins as more programs</text>
  <text start="804.23" dur="4.59">are launched I don&amp;#39;t know exactly how</text>
  <text start="805.82" dur="4.53">that works but very exciting and while</text>

  <text start="876.47" dur="4.89">side of all that works if you&amp;#39;re that</text>
  <text start="880.04" dur="2.43">comfortable with Bitcoin then this will</text>
  <text start="881.36" dur="5.1">make sense to you in this video is</text>
  <text start="882.47" dur="5.97">really short like I said and this is</text>
  <text start="886.46" dur="4.14">interesting the job situation okay I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="894.23" dur="4.8">taxes but like I&amp;#39;ve said we are dealing</text>
  <text start="897.05" dur="4.02">with over a hundred years of economic</text>
  <text start="899.03" dur="3.75">distortion caused by the central bank</text>
  <text start="901.07" dur="4.74">caused by the corruption caused by the</text>
  <text start="902.78" dur="3.84">the rigged system and that is not going</text>
  <text start="905.81" dur="2.82">to go away</text>
  <text start="906.62" dur="6.15">Trump cannot do anything possibly to</text>

  <text start="977.24" dur="5.37">raising interest rates every few months</text>
  <text start="978.91" dur="5.5">that&amp;#39;s gonna have massive impacts on on</text>
  <text start="982.61" dur="3.36">the cost of everything that that is</text>
  <text start="984.41" dur="4.08">related to debt especially as they raise</text>
  <text start="985.97" dur="4.1">interest rates homes car payments things</text>
