  <text start="58.74" dur="6.029">that powered players pass lies for truth</text>

  <text start="98.52" dur="4.919">we kind of left off at 37 39 which was a</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="4.379">duplicate drop but basically said</text>
  <text start="103.439" dur="3.96">something big is coming and it talked</text>
  <text start="105.509" dur="5.04">about Admiral Rogers former NSA director</text>
  <text start="107.399" dur="4.981">and his involvement and I would say the</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="3.93">whole queue movement at this point I</text>
  <text start="112.38" dur="4.08">think he&amp;#39;s behind helping to launch it</text>
  <text start="114.479" dur="4.621">but certainly his involvement with</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="4.409">warning President Trump and this whole</text>
  <text start="119.1" dur="3.54">face an investigation abuse and</text>
  <text start="120.869" dur="3.75">everything ongoing now he&amp;#39;s helping</text>
  <text start="122.64" dur="3.839">Durham this is a big big big deal</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="3.42">especially if you have been following</text>
  <text start="126.479" dur="6.211">the Q movement and know who Admiral</text>
  <text start="128.039" dur="8.691">Rogers is so we have 37:40 here we have</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="4.04">a twitter message let&amp;#39;s check it out</text>
  <text start="137" dur="7.18">q called this back in July news broke</text>
  <text start="140.519" dur="5.961">today absolutely former NSA director is</text>
  <text start="144.18" dur="6.05">cooperating with probe of Trump Russia</text>
  <text start="146.48" dur="7.18">investigation and then way back in 3389</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="6.61">AG and Rogers meeting Durham and Rogers</text>
  <text start="153.66" dur="5.49">meeting oh oh so there&amp;#39;s a lot coming</text>
  <text start="156.84" dur="5.459">here folks and and of course we we know</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="5.04">what that means Rogers is a hero to the</text>
  <text start="162.299" dur="4.861">Q movement just like a general Flynn or</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="4.74">a Trump and this is gonna be a big deal</text>
  <text start="167.16" dur="4.32">this is really gonna be a big deal he is</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="5.04">a cooperating person in this</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="4.89">investigation he&amp;#39;s helping them to find</text>
  <text start="173.97" dur="2.73">all of the dirt on Brennan clapper call</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="4.17">me</text>
  <text start="176.7" dur="6.48">Soros Clinton and Obama and others and</text>
  <text start="180.54" dur="7.05">even all of those dirty rats from the</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="8.07">FBI so he says again something big is</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="7.11">coming now I think personally that it</text>
  <text start="191.25" dur="5.76">will either be a prediction like some</text>
  <text start="194.7" dur="4.619">sort of a major bombshell news drop from</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="5.129">one of the big names out there maybe</text>
  <text start="199.319" dur="4.051">something like a I don&amp;#39;t know I wish I</text>
  <text start="202.139" dur="3.18">could get rid of those notification</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="3.57">pop-ups from Google Chrome I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="205.319" dur="5.7">haven&amp;#39;t figured that one out yet but</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="6.5">we&amp;#39;ll get there anyway so we have as I</text>
  <text start="211.019" dur="5.881">was saying it&amp;#39;s gonna be possibly a big</text>
  <text start="213.44" dur="5.32">bombshell news story like Obama was</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="3.03">guilty of something or Brennan&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="218.76" dur="2.729">to be arrested or something like that</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="3.089">it&amp;#39;s something where it&amp;#39;s really obvious</text>
  <text start="221.489" dur="3.21">someone&amp;#39;s about to be arrested cuz</text>
  <text start="223.019" dur="3.571">that&amp;#39;s almost as good as an arrest</text>
  <text start="224.699" dur="3.881">there&amp;#39;s suspense there&amp;#39;s build-up and</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="5.35">then you can kind of see the prize</text>
  <text start="228.58" dur="4.71">the end however I also think that it</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="4.83">could be an actual arrest of a big</text>
  <text start="233.29" dur="5.67">player possibly call me possibly McCabe</text>
  <text start="236.77" dur="4.08">and then rolling up from there maybe</text>
  <text start="238.96" dur="3.09">even Soros himself right because you</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="3.75">could just go to the head of the snake</text>
  <text start="242.05" dur="5.82">if you&amp;#39;ve got the evidence now this is</text>
  <text start="244.6" dur="5.22">very very very big news this is really</text>
  <text start="247.87" dur="3.99">important because this is where you</text>
  <text start="249.82" dur="6.21">start to get the major players the</text>
  <text start="251.86" dur="7.08">leadership the head of the snake so we</text>
  <text start="256.03" dur="4.59">have a tweet from Trump himself let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.94" dur="4.2">check out what a real Donald Trump has</text>
  <text start="260.62" dur="5.93">to say the Democrats and crooked Hillary</text>
  <text start="263.14" dur="6.06">paid for and provided a fake dossier</text>
  <text start="266.55" dur="4.72">with phony information gotten from</text>
  <text start="269.2" dur="4.47">foreign sources pushed it to the corrupt</text>
  <text start="271.27" dur="5.01">media and dirty cops and have now been</text>
  <text start="273.67" dur="4.89">caught they spied on my campaign then</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="3.71">tried to cover it up just like Watergate</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="5.04">but bigger</text>
  <text start="279.99" dur="5.2">absolutely Hugh says do people really</text>
  <text start="283.6" dur="6.48">think this can happen with no</text>
  <text start="285.19" dur="9.45">consequences FISA equals start nobody is</text>
  <text start="290.08" dur="6.51">above the law not anymore and I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="294.64" dur="4.41">to say this is a really really really</text>
  <text start="296.59" dur="4.65">exciting I mean this means that we will</text>
  <text start="299.05" dur="3.54">see the arrests coming soon and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="2.67">great question do people really think</text>
  <text start="302.59" dur="4.95">that they were gonna get away with this</text>
  <text start="303.91" dur="9.57">I mean not with our president and power</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="8.64">certainly now continuing on 3741 why is</text>
  <text start="313.48" dur="4.47">Pelosi holding the articles of</text>
  <text start="316.18" dur="3.36">impeachment yeah of course so you know</text>
  <text start="317.95" dur="3.15">she doesn&amp;#39;t benefit her to hold the</text>
  <text start="319.54" dur="3.36">articles of impeachment it actually is</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="5.22">hurting the Democrats really badly but</text>
  <text start="322.9" dur="4.74">if she turns it in immediately they lose</text>
  <text start="326.32" dur="2.88">their talking point of impeachment</text>
  <text start="327.64" dur="2.76">because it&amp;#39;ll be acquitted in the Senate</text>
  <text start="329.2" dur="4.11">and everyone in the world will know</text>
  <text start="330.4" dur="6.45">Trump is innocent now there is a darker</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="5.28">sort of more nuanced way of looking at</text>
  <text start="336.85" dur="5.4">this and let me explain briefly I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="5.46">pull up my camera here so um I think</text>
  <text start="342.25" dur="3.45">personally that it&amp;#39;s not about actual</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="3.3">attempt to impeach Trump they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="345.7" dur="3.63">push they&amp;#39;re gonna try but they know</text>
  <text start="347.35" dur="3.87">they can&amp;#39;t do that that&amp;#39;s why they set</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="3.39">up that like Christmas date potential</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="4.5">impeachment date and things like that to</text>
  <text start="352.72" dur="5.1">try to to try to cheat the system but I</text>
  <text start="355.72" dur="3.93">believe that this is about however is</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="4.53">more of an attempt to use this as</text>
  <text start="359.65" dur="5.34">leverage or excuse or</text>
  <text start="362.35" dur="5.07">some sort of AB the new still dossier</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="6.03">right like maybe the PP gate dossier as</text>
  <text start="367.42" dur="5.58">a grounds for further investigation if</text>
  <text start="371.02" dur="3.72">they use that to get a FISA Court well</text>
  <text start="373" dur="3.6">are they gonna be able to use this oh</text>
  <text start="374.74" dur="3.84">he&amp;#39;s being impeached in the house as an</text>
  <text start="376.6" dur="3.75">excuse or grounds to go and get</text>
  <text start="378.58" dur="4.23">Mueller&amp;#39;s records Miller&amp;#39;s report or</text>
  <text start="380.35" dur="4.02">other records on Trump and ramped up</text>
  <text start="382.81" dur="4.41">their investigation even more in some</text>
  <text start="384.37" dur="5.31">way so maybe it&amp;#39;s a way to mine more</text>
  <text start="387.22" dur="5.28">data maybe it&amp;#39;s a way to prop up the</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="5.76">next thing rather than an actual attempt</text>
  <text start="392.5" dur="6.919">to impeach I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s just a way</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="10.139">to think about it so continuing on</text>
  <text start="399.419" dur="9.16">here we have 3741 so why are the two</text>
  <text start="405.579" dur="5.67">articles being held by Pelosi will</text>
  <text start="408.579" dur="4.55">holding actually impact the decision of</text>
  <text start="411.249" dur="4.08">Senate of course not</text>
  <text start="413.129" dur="3.55">now it&amp;#39;s just gonna actually probably</text>
  <text start="415.329" dur="5.13">make more people vote against it just</text>
  <text start="416.679" dur="5.57">out of spite he says no will holding</text>
  <text start="420.459" dur="6.57">actually provide a better scenario</text>
  <text start="422.249" dur="6.94">public opinion to Democrats no not it is</text>
  <text start="427.029" dur="5.46">not it&amp;#39;s costing them twenty twenty</text>
  <text start="429.189" dur="6">already not that they had a chance will</text>
  <text start="432.489" dur="6.45">holding actually sway select senators to</text>
  <text start="435.189" dur="7.56">change their vote no when blackmail and</text>
  <text start="438.939" dur="5.58">threats no longer work that&amp;#39;s funny why</text>
  <text start="442.749" dur="4.41">are the two articles being held by</text>
  <text start="444.519" dur="4.77">Pelosi what happens when the articles of</text>
  <text start="447.159" dur="5.61">impeachment are sent from the house to</text>
  <text start="449.289" dur="5.46">the Senate its acquitted can the Senate</text>
  <text start="452.769" dur="3.99">conduct other business during this time</text>
  <text start="454.749" dur="4.32">no and that might bring up another</text>
  <text start="456.759" dur="4.47">potential excuse as well because maybe</text>
  <text start="459.069" dur="3.72">it blocks the FISA investigation at the</text>
  <text start="461.229" dur="3.51">Senate level maybe it blocks some of the</text>
  <text start="462.789" dur="4.321">counter investigation because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="464.739" dur="4.92">just sort of stalling the pipeline right</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="4.529">now with a clog you know we need a</text>
  <text start="469.659" dur="4.29">plunger in here do we have a plunger to</text>
  <text start="471.639" dur="3.96">get the Democrat clog I&amp;#39;ve heard out of</text>
  <text start="473.949" dur="4.35">our toilet I feel like that&amp;#39;s a pretty</text>
  <text start="475.599" dur="4.92">apt metaphor what do you think what</text>
  <text start="478.299" dur="4.92">value might exist by holding the</text>
  <text start="480.519" dur="5.07">articles and that&amp;#39;s where I explained</text>
  <text start="483.219" dur="3.63">earlier on camera there for a second</text>
  <text start="485.589" dur="3.18">about how I think that this could help</text>
  <text start="486.849" dur="4.95">them in other ways even though it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="488.769" dur="4.92">hurting them in the the actual votes</text>
  <text start="491.799" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s hurting them in the public opinion</text>
  <text start="493.689" dur="3.72">for now but they&amp;#39;re hoping that it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="495.819" dur="4.38">turn back if they were able to get more</text>
  <text start="497.409" dur="8.04">dirt or information or excuses for more</text>
  <text start="500.199" dur="7.68">investigations so what I see where was I</text>
  <text start="505.449" dur="5.97">how long do Senate impeachment trials</text>
  <text start="507.879" dur="7.14">normally take what statements have been</text>
  <text start="511.419" dur="5.55">made in regard to timing think fast</text>
  <text start="515.019" dur="3.75">tracking they&amp;#39;re trying to fast-track it</text>
  <text start="516.969" dur="3.48">and only would take months what</text>
  <text start="518.769" dur="4.65">statements have been made by Chairman</text>
  <text start="520.449" dur="5.49">Graham in regard to Senator FISA</text>
  <text start="523.419" dur="4.35">hearings are Senate FISA hearings and</text>
  <text start="525.939" dur="3.601">witnesses he wants to like call</text>
  <text start="527.769" dur="5.061">witnesses and do all of this other stuff</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="5.63">I showed you guys the video before</text>
  <text start="532.83" dur="4.02">but you know let me bring it right up to</text>
  <text start="535.17" dur="5.67">the top I don&amp;#39;t trust Lindsey Graham I</text>
  <text start="536.85" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t think that he is honest now you</text>
  <text start="540.84" dur="4.41">know maybe he is and maybe he&amp;#39;s playing</text>
  <text start="542.46" dur="4.71">a very very complicated game of 4d chess</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="4.55">himself but he was witnessed and</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="6.99">pictured right there between McCain and</text>
  <text start="549.8" dur="6.4">I always get a jovanovic from you know</text>
  <text start="554.16" dur="4.17">the recent hearings Jovanovic the one</text>
  <text start="556.2" dur="4.59">who blocked the ambassadors here trying</text>
  <text start="558.33" dur="5.4">to come here to give us evidence that we</text>
  <text start="560.79" dur="5.46">have deep state corruption and of course</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="3.96">so it&amp;#39;ll sell sell out of our nation</text>
  <text start="566.25" dur="3.96">billions of dollars going through these</text>
  <text start="567.69" dur="6.27">NGOs to Soros and then being you know a</text>
  <text start="570.21" dur="5.55">couple of crumbs being sent back so</text>
  <text start="573.96" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s kind of what we&amp;#39;re at now and I</text>
  <text start="575.76" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t necessarily trust Lindsey Graham I</text>
  <text start="577.29" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s gonna actually call</text>
  <text start="579.12" dur="3.06">anything I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="580.95" dur="4.89">witnesses I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="582.18" dur="5.91">anything of a punitive nature I think</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="3.51">he&amp;#39;s just gonna talk about it and get us</text>
  <text start="588.09" dur="3.72">really excited that&amp;#39;s what he always</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="5.85">does so do nothing Lindsey Graham over</text>
  <text start="591.81" dur="6.33">here he just seems a little impotent and</text>
  <text start="595.2" dur="5.85">his actions versus his words so</text>
  <text start="598.14" dur="4.65">statements in regard to FISA hearings</text>
  <text start="601.05" dur="4.35">and witnesses he wants to call them</text>
  <text start="602.79" dur="4.31">supposedly and then why is Pelosi</text>
  <text start="605.4" dur="5.25">holding the two articles of impeachment</text>

  <text start="727" dur="5.04">many people could sign a warrant</text>

  <text start="765.7" dur="3.03">finally figured out how to turn them off</text>
  <text start="767.14" dur="3.63">had to hunt through a million things to</text>
  <text start="768.73" dur="3.63">get there but if you guys haven&amp;#39;t heard</text>
  <text start="770.77" dur="2.88">about the brave browser I will include a</text>
  <text start="772.36" dur="4.62">link for you in the description below</text>
  <text start="773.65" dur="6.15">because it is awesome now continuing on</text>
  <text start="776.98" dur="4.14">we had just Lindsey Graham you know tell</text>
  <text start="779.8" dur="3.81">us what he wanted to tell us there and</text>
  <text start="781.12" dur="3.6">it was great it sounded amazing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="783.61" dur="3.21">think he&amp;#39;s gonna do any of it of course</text>
  <text start="784.72" dur="4.92">because it&amp;#39;s Lindsey Graham and you know</text>
  <text start="786.82" dur="4.2">he seems to be as dirty as McCain was I</text>
  <text start="789.64" dur="4.44">mean he was pictured right there between</text>
  <text start="791.02" dur="6.21">McCain and Jovanovic - the crooked</text>
  <text start="794.08" dur="4.59">ambassador who&amp;#39;s trying to block trying</text>
  <text start="797.23" dur="3.72">to impeach Trump and trying to</text>
  <text start="798.67" dur="5.46">the Ukrainian ambassadors from coming</text>
  <text start="800.95" dur="5.76">over here with evidence of the Feist</text>
  <text start="804.13" dur="5.67">abuse and the the five eyes abuse and</text>
  <text start="806.71" dur="6.27">the Ukrainian interference so there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="809.8" dur="5.52">much to this and you know Lindsey Graham</text>
  <text start="812.98" dur="3.99">has a complicated past he&amp;#39;s been seeing</text>
  <text start="815.32" dur="3.78">the right things he&amp;#39;s been talking the</text>
  <text start="816.97" dur="5.82">talk but he has not walked that walk yet</text>
  <text start="819.1" dur="5.01">so we need actual people who were going</text>
  <text start="822.79" dur="3.09">to follow through with their actions I</text>
  <text start="824.11" dur="3.39">mean the the price that you pay for</text>
  <text start="825.88" dur="3.09">listening to someone like a Lindsey</text>
  <text start="827.5" dur="3.06">Graham say I&amp;#39;m gonna do this and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="828.97" dur="3.48">gonna get to the bottom of it is that no</text>
  <text start="830.56" dur="4.11">one else tries to get to the bottom of</text>
  <text start="832.45" dur="3.54">it they assume that he&amp;#39;s gonna honor his</text>
  <text start="834.67" dur="4.38">word and do it and then nothing gets</text>
  <text start="835.99" dur="5.61">done so just kind of my thoughts on</text>
  <text start="839.05" dur="4.98">Lindsey Graham now continuing here q</text>
  <text start="841.6" dur="4.71">says why is Pelosi holding the two</text>
  <text start="844.03" dur="3.84">articles of impeachment again he says</text>
  <text start="846.31" dur="5.31">this all in caps because it&amp;#39;s such an</text>
  <text start="847.87" dur="5.85">important question now again Hugh says</text>
  <text start="851.62" dur="5.97">how do you introduce the truth about</text>
  <text start="853.72" dur="5.37">what happened to the public what value</text>
  <text start="857.59" dur="4.17">might exist by attempting to block</text>
  <text start="859.09" dur="4.02">public testimony and hearings of course</text>
  <text start="861.76" dur="2.49">if they can&amp;#39;t make it public enough</text>
  <text start="863.11" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to arrest that</text>
  <text start="864.25" dur="4.23">the deep state high level actors because</text>
  <text start="866.29" dur="4.38">something like that in this kind of</text>
  <text start="868.48" dur="3.45">country the most powerful nation in the</text>
  <text start="870.67" dur="3.18">world has ever seen I think we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="871.93" dur="4.11">need to be very careful about arresting</text>
  <text start="873.85" dur="5.61">former leaders and stuff like Obama like</text>
  <text start="876.04" dur="5.88">Hillary like Pelosi even Schumer all of</text>
  <text start="879.46" dur="3.93">them these FBI crooked rats I mean</text>
  <text start="881.92" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s a lot of arrests that are coming</text>
  <text start="883.39" dur="4.74">but you have to handle it very carefully</text>
  <text start="885.43" dur="5.01">in the court of public opinion so they</text>
  <text start="888.13" dur="5.04">try to keep everything quiet they try to</text>
  <text start="890.44" dur="4.95">keep everything private so continuing</text>
  <text start="893.17" dur="4.92">Hugh says with educating the public</text>
  <text start="895.39" dur="5.54">through the Senate prior to bar Durham</text>
  <text start="898.09" dur="5.22">and Huber releases be important sure</text>
  <text start="900.93" dur="4.54">because then they&amp;#39;re gonna know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.31" dur="3.72">coming they&amp;#39;re gonna see oh yeah this is</text>
  <text start="905.47" dur="4.32">bad and then the evidence will be</text>
  <text start="907.03" dur="4.74">dropped narratives he says are created</text>
  <text start="909.79" dur="5.4">and pushed to prevent the public from</text>
  <text start="911.77" dur="7.05">discovering the truth yeah now</text>
  <text start="915.19" dur="9.03">continuing on to 37 43 this is</text>
  <text start="918.82" dur="8.58">interesting another Twitter message if</text>
  <text start="924.22" dur="5.43">it opens Kevin McCarthy the FBI broke</text>

  <text start="961.199" dur="4.08">but the only way you can compare this to</text>
  <text start="963.509" dur="4.44">is Watergate they broke into his</text>
