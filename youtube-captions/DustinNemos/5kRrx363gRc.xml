  <text start="30.029" dur="5.501">is RBG still alive that&amp;#39;s a question a</text>
  <text start="34.69" dur="3.299">lot of people have been asking</text>
  <text start="35.53" dur="4.709">themselves lately and however you feel</text>
  <text start="37.989" dur="4.23">about that question whether it pisses</text>
  <text start="40.239" dur="3.241">you off if you&amp;#39;re on the left or if you</text>
  <text start="42.219" dur="3.27">think well of course she&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="43.48" dur="4.679">already dead there&amp;#39;s not a lot of</text>
  <text start="45.489" dur="10.74">evidence otherwise on the right let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="48.159" dur="10.86">check out this now first of all this is</text>
  <text start="56.229" dur="5.97">a slowed down version this person Palma</text>
  <text start="59.019" dur="7.411">deep sea I like it from dune I like that</text>
  <text start="62.199" dur="6.901">okay Paul Muad&amp;#39;Dib 61 the video showing</text>
  <text start="66.43" dur="5.46">proof of life for RPG at the justice</text>
  <text start="69.1" dur="4.89">Stevens memorial is a deep fake okay</text>
  <text start="71.89" dur="5.31">let&amp;#39;s see what he means by that he says</text>
  <text start="73.99" dur="5.46">three people will out walk I think he</text>
  <text start="77.2" dur="6.059">means walk out through two security</text>
  <text start="79.45" dur="6">guards and the velvet rope rope and he</text>
  <text start="83.259" dur="4.11">says roving rope and in one foot space</text>
  <text start="85.45" dur="4.65">between the coffin and the justices okay</text>
  <text start="87.369" dur="3.931">so these people are right up on the</text>
  <text start="90.1" dur="3.42">coffin there&amp;#39;s not a lot of space</text>
  <text start="91.3" dur="5.19">between for example RBG and the people</text>
  <text start="93.52" dur="5.01">next to her and coffin now I also want</text>
  <text start="96.49" dur="3.51">to point out they didn&amp;#39;t he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="98.53" dur="3">mention this but the shadows in this</text>
  <text start="100" dur="3.72">video pay attention to the shadows</text>
  <text start="101.53" dur="4.74">because doesn&amp;#39;t seem like she has one</text>
  <text start="103.72" dur="4.32">and the people beside her as well so</text>
  <text start="106.27" dur="3.48">what looks like has happened here and</text>
  <text start="108.04" dur="5.85">you can actually do this as a youtuber</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="6">to some degree you can add in and remove</text>
  <text start="113.89" dur="3.089">things from other clips if you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="115.75" dur="2.58">the right sort of footage I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="116.979" dur="2.881">how it works but I could show you a</text>
  <text start="118.33" dur="4.01">video where somebody walks you through</text>
  <text start="119.86" dur="5.07">how it works even though I&amp;#39;ve never done</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="8.38">and in that case it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="124.93" dur="13.65">so going through let&amp;#39;s watch this is a</text>
  <text start="130.72" dur="9.769">deep fake video it says okay all the</text>
  <text start="138.58" dur="4.92">people walking behind are blurred out</text>
  <text start="140.489" dur="5.08">this High Definition can&amp;#39;t camera can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="143.5" dur="4.17">stay focused on people walking out this</text>
  <text start="145.569" dur="3.75">slowly and that&amp;#39;s a very good question</text>
  <text start="147.67" dur="3.959">and pay attention again to the shadows</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="7.561">and they&amp;#39;re all blurry in the back very</text>
  <text start="151.629" dur="8.791">blurry and then there&amp;#39;s the velvet rope</text>
  <text start="156.88" dur="6.18">so people can&amp;#39;t cross right in front of</text>
  <text start="160.42" dur="3.99">the security guard clearly and then</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="7.05">there&amp;#39;s the two security guards on the</text>
  <text start="164.41" dur="9.26">right the guy with the angry eyebrows</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="6">now here&amp;#39;s the Rope not robe but rope</text>
  <text start="173.67" dur="4.45">now see she has no shadow but the people</text>
  <text start="176.11" dur="3.9">walking directly behind her there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="178.12" dur="5.31">shadow the lights are coming from her</text>
  <text start="180.01" dur="5.07">left or right and yet this man here</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="4.08">right next to her who&amp;#39;s quite tall has</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="4.74">no shadow even though the woman passing</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="3.93">directly behind him supposedly who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.82" dur="5.37">very blurry and looking directly in the</text>
  <text start="191.44" dur="5.64">camera quite close to him has no shot</text>
  <text start="195.19" dur="3.99">has a shadow you see the shadow just in</text>
  <text start="197.08" dur="4.14">front of her face and of course she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="199.18" dur="3.69">blurry now this woman who&amp;#39;s also blurry</text>
  <text start="201.22" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s strange</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="5.28">is walking in front of him now she looks</text>
  <text start="205.78" dur="5.4">like a wide lady no offense to her but</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="4.59">even at the slimmest of people it would</text>
  <text start="211.18" dur="3.15">have been a challenge to pull this off</text>
  <text start="212.74" dur="7.14">going through a rope and a security</text>
  <text start="214.33" dur="6.24">guard there&amp;#39;s another one again the</text>
  <text start="219.88" dur="2.55">shadows</text>
  <text start="220.57" dur="4.28">she has a shadow the guy there has a</text>
  <text start="222.43" dur="7.5">shadow but this man here has no shadow</text>
  <text start="224.85" dur="6.76">really clear video so he is saying that</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="3.9">this is three separate video feeds</text>
  <text start="231.61" dur="4.59">overlapping and that&amp;#39;s how they would</text>
  <text start="233.83" dur="4.23">have done it the other way now also</text>
  <text start="236.2" dur="4.62">there&amp;#39;s another picture that&amp;#39;s come out</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="5.6">of our BG and and she&amp;#39;s full throated</text>
  <text start="240.82" dur="6.68">and healthy and vibrant and and and</text>
  <text start="243.66" dur="7.33">flush you know she seems very vital and</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="4.96">vigorous and I don&amp;#39;t think that that is</text>
  <text start="250.99" dur="2.91">a true picture of her at all I think</text>
  <text start="252.46" dur="3.35">that&amp;#39;s a deep fake as well we&amp;#39;ll go</text>
  <text start="253.9" dur="6.11">through that as well so you can see</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="10.57">right here at the end at full speed</text>
  <text start="260.01" dur="11.67">something is going on here all right now</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="5.3">continuing on we have</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="3.32">that&amp;#39;s very blurry</text>
  <text start="295.019" dur="7.45">now we also have the picture that was</text>
  <text start="297.939" dur="9.06">supposedly debunking this not taking the</text>
  <text start="302.469" dur="8.76">same time there&amp;#39;s no rope someone is</text>
  <text start="306.999" dur="5.25">giving a eulogy no one&amp;#39;s walking or at</text>
  <text start="311.229" dur="3.631">least there is ropes where they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="312.249" dur="5.57">in the same place a different time of</text>
  <text start="314.86" dur="2.959">the day basically</text>
  <text start="330.14" dur="10.38">you can see there are issues now I&amp;#39;m no</text>
  <text start="336.95" dur="7.89">expert on on breaking down deep fake</text>
  <text start="340.52" dur="6.93">videos and such guys but this is her</text>
  <text start="344.84" dur="5.13">throat which you know no offense it&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="349.97" dur="5.94">she&amp;#39;s very up in ears and she has a very</text>
  <text start="354.02" dur="3.57">open ears kind of complexion and throat</text>
