  <text start="257.959" dur="3.09">suggesting that there were multiple</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="3.78">shooters in the Las Vegas shooting so</text>
  <text start="261.049" dur="3.421">again a slip-up on their part perhaps</text>
  <text start="263.12" dur="3.36">but we already knew</text>
  <text start="264.47" dur="5.19">we already knew we had way too much</text>
  <text start="266.48" dur="5.67">evidence Trump secures concessions from</text>
  <text start="269.66" dur="5.91">the EU specifically from from Yonker</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="5.19">okay the Nazi Air to avoid a trade war</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="3.39">so yet he got some things that have out</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="3.84">of Younker which is good</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="5.52">and Jonker came to us to grovel</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="6.15">basically we did not go to him and Trump</text>
  <text start="284.48" dur="4.56">calls out China for for being vicious on</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="4.47">trade and warns that we were being nice</text>
  <text start="289.04" dur="4.68">until now so with that let&amp;#39;s go through</text>
  <text start="291.8" dur="4.71">some of the cue and on here I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="293.72" dur="6.12">I&amp;#39;m gonna read through and and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.51" dur="4.89">gonna go through 17 11 July 26 so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.84" dur="4.5">just he&amp;#39;s got this huge long link</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="4.8">Gohmert Mueller unmasked PDF he says</text>
  <text start="304.34" dur="5.49">what was the point of filing impeachment</text>
  <text start="306.2" dur="6.21">art articles okay if Ryan was going to</text>
  <text start="309.83" dur="4.08">reject okay so Ryan obviously is push</text>
  <text start="312.41" dur="2.94">you know pushing back and trying to</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="5.43">protect the swamp protect Verizon</text>
  <text start="315.35" dur="5.69">Rosenstein and he says known beforehand</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="4.29">question well of course they knew</text>
  <text start="321.04" dur="5.59">Rosenstein is gonna be protected by Ryan</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="5.58">so they&amp;#39;re thinking optics think</text>
  <text start="326.63" dur="5.25">logically he says whose session or he</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.47">said optics not betting politics think</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="3.93">logically could sessions publicly</text>
  <text start="333.68" dur="2.7">challenged are are without creating a</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="2.67">dilemma</text>
  <text start="336.38" dur="3.99">alright what events would immediately</text>
  <text start="338.48" dur="3.99">transpire if sections challenged RR</text>
  <text start="340.37" dur="4.26">would it immediately demonstrate that</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="5.73">sessions must be aware of key Mueller</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="7.44">facts facts or failure of duty that he</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="6.57">cannot possibly know if refused facts a</text>
  <text start="352.07" dur="5.22">case he has supposed to being recused</text>
  <text start="354.77" dur="5.13">from think logically so he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="357.29" dur="4.53">set up the idea that sessions can&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="359.9" dur="4.08">out with what he really knows yet</text>
  <text start="361.82" dur="4.86">because it hasn&amp;#39;t been brought out to</text>
  <text start="363.98" dur="4.38">him publicly some though so he continues</text>
  <text start="366.68" dur="3.42">and says one challenge to Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="4.02">would immediately trigger attacks to</text>
  <text start="370.1" dur="4.11">remove sessions given his clear</text>
  <text start="372.38" dur="5.22">involvement in receiving information a</text>
  <text start="374.21" dur="4.95">case he is fully refused from okay about</text>
  <text start="377.6" dur="2.91">a case that he&amp;#39;s fully refused from so</text>
  <text start="379.16" dur="4.68">that would that would be a powerful</text>
  <text start="380.51" dur="6.51">argument so that that&amp;#39;s interesting and</text>
  <text start="383.84" dur="5.91">then Q goes on to say who does Huber</text>
  <text start="387.02" dur="5.399">directly report to is it normal for</text>
  <text start="389.75" dur="6.12">Rosenstein or is it normal Rosen scene</text>
  <text start="392.419" dur="5.97">is sidestepped Huber chain-of-command</text>
  <text start="395.87" dur="3.87">so I guess Huber does not</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="5.221">or to rosin scenes that he is</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="6.87">sidestepped why is this important why</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="5.67">did sessions recuse is the left</text>
  <text start="406.61" dur="4.769">attacking sessions what advantages</text>
  <text start="409.28" dur="5.37">exists based on this setup</text>
  <text start="411.379" dur="6.961">POTUS publicly expresses his anger about</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="6.21">the recusal so what they&amp;#39;re thinking is</text>
  <text start="418.34" dur="6.03">that they&amp;#39;re gonna just throw a lot of</text>
  <text start="420.86" dur="5.7">dirt and mud and bad emotion sessions</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="4.019">his way and then the left is gonna like</text>
  <text start="426.56" dur="3.659">start to champion and defend sections</text>
  <text start="428.389" dur="4.14">against Trump because anything Trump</text>
  <text start="430.219" dur="5.63">hates they love and even you know</text>
  <text start="432.529" dur="6.66">pedophilia and things like that and then</text>
  <text start="435.849" dur="6.09">when they they have embraced sessions he</text>
  <text start="439.189" dur="5.76">is just gonna like take them all out</text>
  <text start="441.939" dur="6.16">metaphorically speaking so that this is</text>
  <text start="444.949" dur="5.041">seems to be the the portrait that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.099" dur="4.5">being painted here</text>
  <text start="449.99" dur="5.459">POTUS publicly expresses his anger about</text>
  <text start="452.599" dur="4.651">the recusal and he says continuing do</text>
  <text start="455.449" dur="4.44">you believe POTUS would allow a complete</text>
  <text start="457.25" dur="4.5">takeover of his DOJ if nothing was being</text>
  <text start="459.889" dur="2.541">done behind the scenes to hold people</text>
  <text start="461.75" dur="2.94">accountable</text>
  <text start="462.43" dur="3.849">that&amp;#39;s a great question Lee do you</text>
  <text start="464.69" dur="3.87">actually believe Trump isn&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="466.279" dur="5.07">anything to stop all of this stuff or to</text>
  <text start="468.56" dur="5.069">be prepared for it when POTUS States</text>
  <text start="471.349" dur="5.641">quote the swamp is being drained</text>
  <text start="473.629" dur="6.84">end quote do you believe it when pota</text>
  <text start="476.99" dur="5.669">states is happening do you believe it</text>
  <text start="480.469" dur="5.341">do you believe POTUS would allow</text>
  <text start="482.659" dur="4.53">sessions and RR to run his DOJ if</text>
  <text start="485.81" dur="4.05">something wasn&amp;#39;t being done to his</text>
  <text start="487.189" dur="5.611">liking logical thinking click bait</text>
  <text start="489.86" dur="6.089">derails a logical thought think for</text>
