  <text start="5.35" dur="5.169">what a sad weekend I just finished</text>

  <text start="13.4" dur="4.44">families of the victims of the El Paso</text>

  <text start="23.599" dur="6.69">the United States of America it is</text>
  <text start="26.449" dur="6.781">indeed such a sad day and time in the</text>
  <text start="30.289" dur="6.84">history of the world the worst sort of</text>
  <text start="33.23" dur="7.079">monster shoots up random people that it</text>
  <text start="37.129" dur="6.57">is the fact that insanity is obviously</text>
  <text start="40.309" dur="7.951">involved one of these shooters even shot</text>
  <text start="43.699" dur="7.351">his own sister it is terribly sad we are</text>
  <text start="48.26" dur="5.43">lucky that at least he was not able to</text>
  <text start="51.05" dur="5.34">continue shooting because quick-acting</text>
  <text start="53.69" dur="5.45">law enforcement was able to kill him</text>
  <text start="56.39" dur="5.759">within a minute of his attack in Dayton</text>
  <text start="59.14" dur="6.01">the president has asked tech companies</text>
  <text start="62.149" dur="5.361">to work with law enforcement to help</text>
  <text start="65.15" dur="6.15">solve these problems</text>
  <text start="67.51" dur="6.22">my company takes a firm stand in helping</text>
  <text start="71.3" dur="5.49">law enforcement and within minutes of</text>
  <text start="73.73" dur="6.06">these two tragedies we were working with</text>
  <text start="76.79" dur="6.23">FBI agents to find out what information</text>
  <text start="79.79" dur="6.75">we could to help in their investigations</text>
  <text start="83.02" dur="6.24">our company has always worked with law</text>
  <text start="86.54" dur="6.6">enforcement to help them with their</text>
  <text start="89.26" dur="7.06">investigations we have never predicted</text>
  <text start="93.14" dur="5.82">illegal speech as it seems that we have</text>
  <text start="96.32" dur="6.06">been accused by by some less than</text>
  <text start="98.96" dur="4.89">credible journalists we have responded</text>
  <text start="102.38" dur="5.19">with both vigor</text>
  <text start="103.85" dur="6.26">and integrity every single time that a</text>
  <text start="107.57" dur="5.43">threat of violence has been posted and</text>
  <text start="110.11" dur="7.48">information for it has been requested by</text>
  <text start="113" dur="7.08">law enforcement I am aware this is not</text>
  <text start="117.59" dur="5.01">protected speech and I employed</text>
  <text start="120.08" dur="5.49">full-time staff who have a sole</text>
  <text start="122.6" dur="6.48">responsibility to service these requests</text>
  <text start="125.57" dur="5.249">made by law enforcement in May my</text>
  <text start="129.08" dur="4.98">company was mentioned in congressional</text>
  <text start="130.819" dur="4.481">testimony we are not such a large</text>
  <text start="134.06" dur="4.05">company</text>
  <text start="135.3" dur="7.32">and the assistant director of the FBI</text>
  <text start="138.11" dur="6.91">Michael McGarity had not heard of us so</text>
  <text start="142.62" dur="6.5">he was unable to respond to questions</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="6.9">about us however we did immediately</text>
  <text start="149.12" dur="5.05">compile all FBI requests and</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="6.12">dispositions of them and make that</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="6.87">available to him immediately after that</text>
  <text start="158.04" dur="6.72">request was made so it needs to be</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="7.68">states that we are in compliance with</text>
  <text start="164.76" dur="6.99">the law we have always been aggressively</text>
  <text start="168.72" dur="8.13">forthcoming to help law enforcement of</text>
  <text start="171.75" dur="8.34">it there are about 1 million users of hn</text>
  <text start="176.85" dur="6.69">hn is an empty piece of paper for</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="7.29">writing on it is disturbing to me that</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="6.87">it can be so easily shut down over the</text>
  <text start="187.38" dur="6.36">weekend the domain name service for hn</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="7.17">was abruptly terminated by the provider</text>
  <text start="193.74" dur="6.84">CloudFlare some people may applaud that</text>
  <text start="197.58" dur="4.86">decision it was made by one of their</text>
  <text start="200.58" dur="7.02">founders according to his Twitter</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="7.56">profile he is a recovering lawyer they</text>
  <text start="207.6" dur="4.8">are a private company and of course have</text>
  <text start="210" dur="4.98">a right to stop doing business with me</text>
  <text start="212.4" dur="8.19">likely this is because of their intended</text>
  <text start="214.98" dur="8.37">and soon to happen IPO calling 8ch net</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="5.85">lawless by design he decided to</text>
  <text start="223.35" dur="6.63">terminate us this is of course an untrue</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="7.26">statement he did terminate us though so</text>
  <text start="229.98" dur="6.9">it becomes time to find a new home think</text>
  <text start="233.7" dur="5.48">of HN as a large community of 1 million</text>
  <text start="236.88" dur="5.91">people that are now looking for a home</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="8.47">first of all the O Paso to derp o stood</text>
  <text start="242.79" dur="8.13">on Instagram not 8chan later someone</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="5.309">uploaded a manifesto however that</text>
  <text start="250.92" dur="5.129">manifesto was not uploaded by the</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="5.731">Walmart shooter I don&amp;#39;t know if he wrote</text>
  <text start="256.049" dur="5.761">it or not but it was not uploaded by the</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="4.92">murderer that is clear and law</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="5.34">enforcement was made aware of this</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="5.38">before most people had even heard the</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="4.91">horrific</text>
  <text start="268.99" dur="5.92">the spirit and letter of the law have</text>
  <text start="272.06" dur="5.18">always been faithfully fulfilled and my</text>
  <text start="274.91" dur="5.67">company has always made certain of that</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="6.82">it is unfortunate that this place of</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="7.11">free speech has temporarily been removed</text>
  <text start="284.06" dur="5.94">we are working to restore service thank</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="4.65">you to the incredible people and</text>
  <text start="290" dur="5.79">companies that are helping with this</text>
  <text start="292.34" dur="6.84">task it is clearly a political move to</text>
  <text start="295.79" dur="6.15">remove hn from CloudFlare it has forced</text>
  <text start="299.18" dur="6.18">a lot of people to find other places to</text>
  <text start="301.94" dur="7.289">talk it has dispersed a peacefully</text>
  <text start="305.36" dur="6.66">assembled group of people talking this</text>
  <text start="309.229" dur="4.44">silenced them effectively the spirit of</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="5.36">what the President of the United States</text>
  <text start="313.669" dur="6.691">asked tech companies to do has been</text>
  <text start="317.38" dur="5.83">violated it is effective to silence</text>
  <text start="320.36" dur="5.91">these people by removing the pen and ink</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="5.15">that they write with let&amp;#39;s look at the</text>
  <text start="326.27" dur="5.73">deflection that took place here</text>
  <text start="328.36" dur="7.739">public companies casting blame for</text>
  <text start="332" dur="7.47">murder on small private companies</text>
  <text start="336.099" dur="5.861">law-abiding companies with some hard</text>
  <text start="339.47" dur="5.58">work by my engineers we were able to</text>
  <text start="341.96" dur="5.76">move hn to a new network this was a</text>
  <text start="345.05" dur="5.04">smaller company after our move was</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="6.02">complete their upstream provider a</text>
  <text start="350.09" dur="6.96">public company shut off service to them</text>
  <text start="353.74" dur="5.83">their company suffers as well for taking</text>
  <text start="357.05" dur="5.76">on the responsibility of running a</text>
  <text start="359.57" dur="6.659">network that my company has touched it</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="5.49">is actually sinister behavior ours is</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="4.831">one of the last independent companies</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="5.76">that offer a place you may write down</text>
  <text start="371.06" dur="5.16">your thoughts free from having to worry</text>
  <text start="374.06" dur="4.079">about whether they are offensive to one</text>
  <text start="376.22" dur="4.819">group or another</text>
  <text start="378.139" dur="5.881">power consolidation of the media</text>
  <text start="381.039" dur="5.53">beginning as radio and TV stations were</text>
  <text start="384.02" dur="5.79">gobbled up by a few strong and rich</text>
  <text start="386.569" dur="6.961">companies is now moving at a breakneck</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="6.629">pace through the internet it will</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="4.859">effectively silence the masses and leave</text>
  <text start="396.439" dur="5.521">them with no place to voice their</text>
  <text start="398.389" dur="6.93">messages I want to say again that</text>
  <text start="401.96" dur="7.019">contrary to the unfounded claim by mr.</text>
  <text start="405.319" dur="7.081">Prince of CloudFlare HN is a lawful</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="6">community abiding by the laws of the</text>

  <text start="436.33" dur="5.47">hopefully service will be restored</text>
  <text start="438.62" dur="5.419">shortly again my thoughts and prayers</text>
  <text start="441.8" dur="4.64">are for the victims of the violence</text>
