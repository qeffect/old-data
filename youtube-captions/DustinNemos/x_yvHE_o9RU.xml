  <text start="24.9" dur="4.35">I was already being hit pretty hard on</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="4.17">in terms of you know censorship myself</text>
  <text start="29.25" dur="3.989">and the algorithm and all of that before</text>

  <text start="41.43" dur="4.89">engagement on YouTube for this channel</text>
  <text start="44.879" dur="4.531">remember the first channel was banned</text>

  <text start="55.469" dur="3.301">this is what&amp;#39;s happened to my channel</text>
  <text start="57" dur="3.39">because they do not like what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="3.39">talking about they don&amp;#39;t like the truths</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="3.3">that I&amp;#39;m putting out there they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="62.16" dur="3.389">like the attention that it brings to</text>
  <text start="63.69" dur="3.179">people who are corrupt and they really</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t like the fact that I&amp;#39;m a pretty</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="5.221">stalwart defender of our president so</text>
  <text start="69.299" dur="4.32">you know you see the metrics you see</text>

  <text start="78.689" dur="3.901">believe it at all I don&amp;#39;t believe any of</text>
  <text start="80.369" dur="5.671">these numbers you know it is shot up and</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="5.61">then were dead I think I&amp;#39;m actually the</text>
  <text start="86.04" dur="4.439">most censored person in queueing on if</text>
  <text start="88.2" dur="6.51">not all of YouTube and I say that</text>
  <text start="90.479" dur="6.991">because let&amp;#39;s continue here in terms of</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="5.299">actual let&amp;#39;s see subscribers doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="97.47" dur="9.09">even let me do that</text>
  <text start="100.009" dur="11.881">yeah so from subscribers I flatlined for</text>

  <text start="121.11" dur="2.939">that&amp;#39;s exactly when I started talking</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="4.23">about stock bid burning but it&amp;#39;s close</text>
  <text start="124.049" dur="4.231">so since I started talking about the</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="3.9">lawsuit and the censorship and stuff</text>
  <text start="128.28" dur="4.08">I&amp;#39;ve noticed that other channels that</text>
