  <text start="99.38" dur="6.45">just became put through a series of</text>
  <text start="102.95" dur="4.44">events in my life that showed me the</text>
  <text start="105.83" dur="5.76">inner workings of Hollywood in a way</text>
  <text start="107.39" dur="6.509">that is not known to the public and</text>
  <text start="111.59" dur="4.29">everybody speculates there&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="113.899" dur="4.86">agendas we&amp;#39;re starting to notice we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="115.88" dur="4.65">starting to see and I knew that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="118.759" dur="3.48">sitting on documents from William Morris</text>
  <text start="120.53" dur="3.69">Agency telling me what&amp;#39;s right about</text>
  <text start="122.239" dur="4.891">telling me this telling me that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="124.22" dur="5.099">sitting on a lot of knowledge that the</text>
  <text start="127.13" dur="5.93">world needs basically and all it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="129.319" dur="7.17">take is for me to just you know</text>
  <text start="133.06" dur="5.74">basically burn down certain things that</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="4.741">I had spent about ten years building so</text>
  <text start="138.8" dur="5.76">but to me that&amp;#39;s the whole spirit right</text>
  <text start="141.23" dur="5.43">now everything is learning on this</text>
  <text start="144.56" dur="4.83">planet that all of this stuff is bigger</text>
  <text start="146.66" dur="6.299">than us and that was my call to action</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="5.28">was okay there&amp;#39;s a deficit between what</text>
  <text start="152.959" dur="4.641">the people know and what you know and</text>
  <text start="154.67" dur="4.18">everybody needs to get to understand</text>
  <text start="157.6" dur="3.83">what</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="3.9">it really is and what&amp;#39;s really being</text>
  <text start="161.43" dur="3.84">done with our content and how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.75" dur="6.27">actually really being used to control us</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="6.18">not only that very real but how it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.02" dur="4.11">being done and also what should we make</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="3.3">me said so it just kind of felt like</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="5.07">everybody right now is being activated</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="6.93">to these purposes of okay this is not</text>
  <text start="178.2" dur="4.86">how it should be and also here&amp;#39;s what we</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="3.6">should build instead and we can do it</text>
  <text start="183.06" dur="7.23">because of Technology we just have to</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="7.2">readjust our mindset and know that we</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="5.28">have everything we need to build what we</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="5.64">want we just have to assemble as we were</text>
  <text start="195.57" dur="4.17">talking about before you know I really</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="3.36">appreciate the idea of creating</text>
  <text start="199.74" dur="3.57">something to replace rather than just to</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="2.97">destroy what Hollywood has become</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="2.97">because you know people on this channel</text>
  <text start="204.45" dur="4.11">are very familiar with sort of the</text>
  <text start="206.28" dur="6.03">propaganda aspects and and the cultural</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="5.49">indoctrination aspects but what&amp;#39;s next</text>
  <text start="212.31" dur="3.48">what&amp;#39;s new what&amp;#39;s going to replace this</text>
  <text start="214.05" dur="3.09">how do we how do we overcome it you know</text>
  <text start="215.79" dur="2.76">I know that there&amp;#39;s a conservative</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="2.1">Hollywood movement coming is that what</text>
  <text start="218.55" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="219.24" dur="6.93">no to me it&amp;#39;s about decentralization so</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="6.18">yeah people&amp;#39;s the stories that people</text>
  <text start="226.17" dur="4.83">want are not being told so over the</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="3.06">weekend or last week I was just with a</text>
  <text start="231" dur="3.51">lot of people who made um plans the</text>
  <text start="232.53" dur="4.56">producers the people who financed it all</text>
  <text start="234.51" dur="4.74">that stuff and it it shouldn&amp;#39;t be so</text>
  <text start="237.09" dur="4.8">hard for that movie to get made and what</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="4.5">we have right now is a centralized</text>
  <text start="241.89" dur="6.3">control system a centralized power</text>
  <text start="243.75" dur="6.81">system and I don&amp;#39;t care what stories</text>
  <text start="248.19" dur="4.56">people want people are only getting what</text>
  <text start="250.56" dur="4.38">Hollywood wants you to have right and</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="5.52">that&amp;#39;s it when people need to realize is</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="6.09">that our stories actually are what our</text>
  <text start="258.27" dur="4.17">society is people used to understand</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="3.06">this people used to understand this in a</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="3.51">way that we&amp;#39;ve been really brainwashed</text>
  <text start="264.09" dur="3.18">to think that entertainment and pop</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="4.41">culture are just sort of this like</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="6.89">add-on to our lives but actually the</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="3.8">importance of what storytelling is is</text>
  <text start="274.29" dur="3.15">I don&amp;#39;t know that there&amp;#39;s anything</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="3.87">really more important to a society then</text>
  <text start="277.44" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s stories sure that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="3.93">literally know who we are that&amp;#39;s how we</text>
  <text start="281.13" dur="5.58">know what we&amp;#39;ve done that&amp;#39;s how we know</text>
  <text start="283.26" dur="4.59">what we want to become and it&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="3.21">those stories are in the hands of</text>
  <text start="287.85" dur="4.38">artists that&amp;#39;s all you need to do</text>
  <text start="289.92" dur="4.62">because an artist who doesn&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="292.23" dur="4.29">sell their soul and an artist who isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="294.54" dur="4.08">being forced to put agendas into things</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s just gonna make what they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="3.45">told to make it&amp;#39;s like when someone goes</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="4.56">to write a song where did that song come</text>
  <text start="302.07" dur="6.06">from it wasn&amp;#39;t there and then now it is</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="4.95">right so artists and creators and people</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="3.36">can just like technology people who</text>
  <text start="310.2" dur="4.41">build technology people who come up with</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="4.92">things divine inspirations it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="4.71">all that outside this control system</text>
  <text start="316.41" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s decentralizing that power so that</text>
  <text start="319.32" dur="3.6">we don&amp;#39;t have these false idols that</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="4.47">were supposed to worship and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="322.92" dur="5.43">supposed to follow that a large amount</text>
  <text start="326.16" dur="3.78">of people can make and create content</text>
  <text start="328.35" dur="5.07">that can reach a large amount of people</text>
  <text start="329.94" dur="5.88">in a big and meaningful way and just say</text>
  <text start="333.42" dur="5.58">hey okay Holly we can do it all I was</text>
  <text start="335.82" dur="4.68">going to do but there&amp;#39;s gonna be they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="339" dur="3.3">not gonna be the only game in town</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re not gonna have they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="4.11">to be at the epicenter of our content so</text>
  <text start="344.4" dur="3.24">yeah Christian stories not getting told</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="2.7">conservative stories are not getting</text>
  <text start="347.64" dur="3.39">told you know talked with Roseanne</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="4.02">regularly about the things that she went</text>
  <text start="351.03" dur="4.58">through in terms of her storylines on</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="4.56">ABC and how they were trying to</text>
  <text start="355.61" dur="3.52">manipulate all that and Taylor all that</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="3.72">and the biggest one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="3.54">problems for them was that in one family</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="2.82">it was people with different political</text>
  <text start="362.67" dur="2.73">opinions and they actually got along and</text>
  <text start="364.23" dur="3.87">loved each other they didn&amp;#39;t want that</text>

  <text start="371.55" dur="5.4">they needed to get rid of her so because</text>
  <text start="374.07" dur="6.48">of that and other things so you start to</text>
  <text start="376.95" dur="5.4">realize that all we need to do is all</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="2.79">the creators and all the people who want</text>
  <text start="382.35" dur="2.34">to create and all the people who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="3.18">locked up in Hollywood I wouldn&amp;#39;t sell</text>

  <text start="412.62" dur="6.15">agenda corporate media corporate based</text>
  <text start="413.97" dur="7.11">you know to me leads through in a sense</text>

  <text start="439.47" dur="7.53">starving for and that storytelling</text>
  <text start="442.56" dur="6">literally I mean there&amp;#39;s so so much of</text>
  <text start="447" dur="3.9">this began for me when I started to find</text>
  <text start="448.56" dur="4.079">out about like the Pentagon and CIA</text>
  <text start="450.9" dur="6.75">involvement Hollywood enticed artists</text>

  <text start="457.65" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;m a very sort of anti-war person and I</text>
  <text start="459.6" dur="4.17">feel like it&amp;#39;s the thing that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="461.91" dur="6.27">used to really enslave the American</text>
  <text start="463.77" dur="6.42">people in general and like the biggest</text>
  <text start="468.18" dur="4.5">sort of mind-control sia on Americans</text>
  <text start="470.19" dur="4.59">that for our military presence in the</text>
  <text start="472.68" dur="4.169">world is like needed it stabilizes</text>
  <text start="474.78" dur="3.75">everything and we&amp;#39;re always doing the</text>
  <text start="476.849" dur="3">right thing our military actually works</text>
  <text start="478.53" dur="3.69">for us and all these things that</text>
  <text start="479.849" dur="4.29">Hollywood has told you know even in the</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="3.419">military they know better they know that</text>
  <text start="484.139" dur="4.771">they&amp;#39;re being exploited and they come on</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="6.65">they do but those stories those stories</text>
  <text start="488.91" dur="5.729">if those stories were able to be told</text>
  <text start="492.289" dur="4.541">people would be able to feel those</text>
  <text start="494.639" dur="3.871">feelings people would be able to express</text>
  <text start="496.83" dur="4.23">those for this those films would be safe</text>
  <text start="498.51" dur="6.15">feelings to have and not only that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.06" dur="5.76">like you go back to Vietnam you go back</text>
  <text start="504.66" dur="4.2">to like the scripts that were not</text>
  <text start="506.82" dur="3.21">allowed to be made and I have all this</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="2.61">research and I put a lot of this</text>
  <text start="510.03" dur="4.26">research out there a lot of it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="511.47" dur="5.34">to be in my documentary um</text>
  <text start="514.29" dur="2.94">the stories that were not able to be</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="2.43">told</text>
  <text start="517.23" dur="5.73">versus the stories that were able to be</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="7.68">told when platoon was made and it was</text>
  <text start="522.96" dur="5.25">made outside the purview the the the</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="3.48">government did not want this movie made</text>
  <text start="528.21" dur="3.63">not helped make this movie I think it</text>
  <text start="530.4" dur="4.74">was full tune yeah I was with whom but</text>
  <text start="531.84" dur="5.16">then you go talk to vets and it was the</text>
  <text start="535.14" dur="3.51">story of my war had finally been told</text>
  <text start="537" dur="3.54">the way that it was but the reason that</text>
  <text start="538.65" dur="3.51">the US military didn&amp;#39;t want this movie</text>
  <text start="540.54" dur="4.53">to be made was because of depiction of</text>
  <text start="542.16" dur="5.25">the US soldier it was it was they were</text>
  <text start="545.07" dur="4.83">you know doing the things that the</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="4.86">soldiers were doing at that time and so</text>
  <text start="549.9" dur="4.38">you start to realize that what stories</text>
  <text start="552.27" dur="4.47">have the capacity to do is literally</text>
  <text start="554.28" dur="4.89">alleviate suffering and make people feel</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="4.44">less alone in the world and make people</text>
  <text start="559.17" dur="3.81">feel like you know understood and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="561.18" dur="4.05">yeah that&amp;#39;s what I experienced in that</text>
  <text start="562.98" dur="4.8">and when we can&amp;#39;t tell those stories</text>
  <text start="565.23" dur="5.79">were not allowed to we see what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="567.78" dur="5.13">doing to society yeah it is very</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="4.29">powerful the story is the lens you see</text>
  <text start="572.91" dur="4.5">the world through and it&amp;#39;s when you</text>

  <text start="623.61" dur="4.06">that that</text>
  <text start="625.3" dur="4.59">I want to comment that the the integrity</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="4.34">of the military perception that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629.89" dur="5.19">this honorable in a noble career is</text>
  <text start="632.01" dur="4.48">paramount to state power but at the same</text>
  <text start="635.08" dur="3.39">time it&amp;#39;s always completely</text>
  <text start="636.49" dur="3.539">contradictory to reality and the</text>

  <text start="640.029" dur="4.771">live through it so you know it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="642.04" dur="5.16">the idea is noble but the actual follow</text>
  <text start="644.8" dur="4.229">through because of the corruption always</text>
  <text start="647.2" dur="5.009">is tainted am i right about that you</text>
  <text start="649.029" dur="6.301">think yeah I do I think so and I think</text>
  <text start="652.209" dur="5.791">that if if people had the opportunity to</text>
  <text start="655.33" dur="4.11">so when people want to talk about what</text>
  <text start="658" dur="2.91">the military is doing or they want to</text>
  <text start="659.44" dur="5.269">talk about Iraq or they want to talk</text>
  <text start="660.91" dur="3.799">about or they want to tell these stories</text>
  <text start="665.09" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s Hollywood has been in bed</text>
  <text start="667.64" dur="5.88">with the government in a way that is a</text>
  <text start="670.1" dur="5.52">bombshell since I would say at least the</text>
  <text start="673.52" dur="5.39">40s but you know even previous to that</text>
  <text start="675.62" dur="6.42">but um essentially these filmmakers</text>
  <text start="678.91" dur="4.69">exploit our government and the</text>
  <text start="682.04" dur="4.53">government exploits them right back and</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s like you should give the boys with</text>
  <text start="686.57" dur="4.29">all the toys and if you want to talk</text>
  <text start="688.55" dur="3.45">about what they&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="690.86" dur="2.4">have to let them read the script and</text>
  <text start="692" dur="2.43">they&amp;#39;re gonna have to have complete you</text>
  <text start="693.26" dur="2.97">know they signed a contract the</text>
  <text start="694.43" dur="4.31">filmmakers and it&amp;#39;s a very it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="696.23" dur="5.04">relationship of mutual exploitation but</text>
  <text start="698.74" dur="4.66">we&amp;#39;re you know whereas I believe what we</text>
  <text start="701.27" dur="4.26">need to go into is okay great</text>
  <text start="703.4" dur="4.23">there actually need to be rental</text>
  <text start="705.53" dur="4.17">companies that you can open up enormous</text>
  <text start="707.63" dur="3.12">amounts of other business so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="709.7" dur="4.5">somebody around here where I live who</text>
  <text start="710.75" dur="6.3">does like you know they they buy up you</text>

  <text start="725.3" dur="4.5">know stipulations over the scripts like</text>
  <text start="727.58" dur="4.5">can I come rent from you and make</text>
  <text start="729.8" dur="4.53">whatever story I want he&amp;#39;s like yeah of</text>
  <text start="732.08" dur="4.08">course it&amp;#39;s like well you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="734.33" dur="2.97">that vias government you don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="736.16" dur="1.59">with Pentagon you don&amp;#39;t have that with</text>
  <text start="737.3" dur="2.1">the CIA</text>
  <text start="737.75" dur="3.96">so it&amp;#39;s interesting and this should be a</text>
  <text start="739.4" dur="5.7">hole there should be a whole sector</text>
  <text start="741.71" dur="5.88">people who rent military I mean in there</text>
  <text start="745.1" dur="4.68">are but it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="747.59" dur="4.23">compete with the Pentagon yeah they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="749.78" dur="3.69">throw millions of dollars into a couple</text>
  <text start="751.82" dur="3.6">days of filming just so that they can</text>
  <text start="753.47" dur="6.12">get a few scripted lines into their</text>
  <text start="755.42" dur="6.93">their PR yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a huge deception</text>
  <text start="759.59" dur="5.1">its enormous ly deceptive minutes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="762.35" dur="4.92">got to be exposed and I think things</text>
  <text start="764.69" dur="3.87">need to change in that if the Pentagon</text>
  <text start="767.27" dur="3.42">was involved in the making of this</text>
  <text start="768.56" dur="4.14">Hollywood movie that should almost be</text>
  <text start="770.69" dur="4.05">like a food label you should know that</text>
  <text start="772.7" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re consuming yeah GMO</text>
  <text start="774.74" dur="4.77">for Pentagon free maybe this had like</text>
  <text start="777.41" dur="3.84">literally pent that&amp;#39;s what you know I</text>
  <text start="779.51" dur="2.79">joke with some people like Roseanne like</text>
  <text start="781.25" dur="3.57">oh we&amp;#39;re gonna make a production company</text>
  <text start="782.3" dur="5.1">called pimp free productions you know I</text>
  <text start="784.82" dur="5.13">love it because no children were harmed</text>
  <text start="787.4" dur="3.93">in the making of this movie because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="789.95" dur="4.41">like</text>
  <text start="791.33" dur="5.699">you know at this point there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="794.36" dur="4.47">that needs to change and it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="797.029" dur="3.99">wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great if there was a</text>
  <text start="798.83" dur="3.9">label when you say that no children are</text>
  <text start="801.019" dur="4.021">harmed you kind of make make it as a</text>
  <text start="802.73" dur="4.74">joke but in Hollywood we know better but</text>
  <text start="805.04" dur="3.69">maybe for the more mainstream crowd but</text>
  <text start="807.47" dur="3.84">if there was a label that said there</text>
  <text start="808.73" dur="4.14">were no sexual scandals of all of any</text>
  <text start="811.31" dur="3.99">kind around this particular production</text>
  <text start="812.87" dur="4.74">and those involve no actresses were</text>
  <text start="815.3" dur="4.2">molested or raped pasty couch or</text>
  <text start="817.61" dur="4.38">something no souls no souls were sold in</text>
  <text start="819.5" dur="4.709">the making of this movie I love it yeah</text>
  <text start="821.99" dur="4.92">I think that would be incredibly popular</text>
  <text start="824.209" dur="4.141">if it were branded yeah I agree with you</text>
  <text start="826.91" dur="3.359">I think that that&amp;#39;s kind of the</text>
  <text start="828.35" dur="3.78">direction we have to go because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="830.269" dur="4.231">still in that awakening process where</text>
  <text start="832.13" dur="5.04">people but people are gonna start to</text>
  <text start="834.5" dur="4.47">understand in a big way I&amp;#39;m I am on the</text>
  <text start="837.17" dur="5.52">phone every single day with people whose</text>
  <text start="838.97" dur="5.76">names you know whose songs you sing and</text>
  <text start="842.69" dur="3.75">whose movies you&amp;#39;ve seen and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="844.73" dur="5.549">just like thank you for what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="846.44" dur="5.43">doing and raw here you know these people</text>
  <text start="850.279" dur="3.421">have a lot of infrastructure around</text>
  <text start="851.87" dur="3.45">their lives and they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="853.7" dur="3.15">people that work for them and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="855.32" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s easier for me to do what I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="856.85" dur="4.08">versus then but they all are ready to</text>
  <text start="858.8" dur="4.83">tell their stories and they all ready to</text>
  <text start="860.93" dur="4.95">say this is a slave system it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="863.63" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s gonna be wild over the next couple</text>
  <text start="865.88" dur="4.86">years it&amp;#39;s just gonna be I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="869.54" dur="4.62">know how to describe it but I just</text>
  <text start="870.74" dur="4.83">imagine people just like almost in shock</text>
  <text start="874.16" dur="3.57">because it&amp;#39;s just gonna keep coming and</text>
  <text start="875.57" dur="4.68">coming and coming now let me ask because</text>
  <text start="877.73" dur="4.95">this is a good segue when you say that a</text>
  <text start="880.25" dur="4.74">lot of this informations coming out and</text>
  <text start="882.68" dur="4.44">these disclosures I guess or maybe not a</text>
  <text start="884.99" dur="3.57">good word but just the information about</text>
  <text start="887.12" dur="3.93">some of the corruption makes it to the</text>
  <text start="888.56" dur="4.589">surface do you think that the human</text>
  <text start="891.05" dur="3.479">trafficking of children specifically is</text>
  <text start="893.149" dur="3.031">going to come out to the surface in a</text>
  <text start="894.529" dur="3.631">bigger way because that&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="896.18" dur="3.57">people are thinking you know it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="898.16" dur="3.36">dark no one could ever believe it we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="899.75" dur="4.49">get some of the surface level stuff but</text>
  <text start="901.52" dur="2.72">what about the kids</text>
  <text start="904.389" dur="6.28">when I think energetically and I think</text>
  <text start="907.369" dur="5.43">on a spiritual level that is like the</text>
  <text start="910.669" dur="4.85">thread that we have to pull because that</text>
  <text start="912.799" dur="6.18">is what has been holding this whole</text>
  <text start="915.519" dur="5.44">prison pyramid of a world together I</text>
  <text start="918.979" dur="4.37">believe has really been held together</text>
  <text start="920.959" dur="5.91">with trauma trauma-based mind control</text>
  <text start="923.349" dur="5.65">the abuse of children and the what</text>
  <text start="926.869" dur="4.73">middle yeah black of everything that</text>
  <text start="928.999" dur="6.18">goes along with all of that has really</text>
  <text start="931.599" dur="6.85">actually been what&amp;#39;s held this dark</text>
  <text start="935.179" dur="4.86">fallen world together and I do think</text>
  <text start="938.449" dur="3.75">that the more that we pick at that and</text>
  <text start="940.039" dur="3.75">the more that we expose that and the</text>
  <text start="942.199" dur="3.491">more that we that&amp;#39;s why I cover that so</text>
  <text start="943.789" dur="3.551">much because</text>
  <text start="945.69" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s the thread you pol I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="947.34" dur="5.43">the real Achilles heel in terms of</text>
  <text start="949.35" dur="5.49">people have been doing in order to get</text>
  <text start="952.77" dur="5">these mind control slaves who they then</text>
  <text start="954.84" dur="5.43">elevate in politics and in Hollywood</text>
  <text start="957.77" dur="4.57">these people were raised in sex cults</text>
  <text start="960.27" dur="5.01">Joaquin Phoenix was raised in a sex cult</text>
  <text start="962.34" dur="5.37">where children had sex as young as four</text>
  <text start="965.28" dur="5.54">with adults that is I&amp;#39;m not breaking</text>
  <text start="967.71" dur="7.53">news here that is it that is on record</text>
  <text start="970.82" dur="7.87">absolute fact and so you just start to</text>
  <text start="975.24" dur="5.25">realize this whole system from the</text>
  <text start="978.69" dur="2.91">politicians who&amp;#39;ve been blackmailed to</text>
  <text start="980.49" dur="3.36">the celebrities who you&amp;#39;re taught to</text>
  <text start="981.6" dur="4.14">worship it&amp;#39;s all being held together</text>
  <text start="983.85" dur="4.62">through the abuse of children it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.74" dur="5.4">like monsters Inc the trauma of children</text>
  <text start="988.47" dur="4.47">really is powering the city you know</text>
  <text start="991.14" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s funny I wanted to go back and watch</text>
  <text start="992.94" dur="3.3">an old movie so I didn&amp;#39;t have to watch</text>
  <text start="994.68" dur="3.99">things like monsters in because it seems</text>
  <text start="996.24" dur="4.02">everything now is based on the</text>
  <text start="998.67" dur="3.93">exploitation or the destruction of</text>
  <text start="1000.26" dur="4.32">children or or their souls or sort of</text>
  <text start="1002.6" dur="3.06">the parasitical consumption or something</text>
  <text start="1004.58" dur="2.85">of their fear</text>
  <text start="1005.66" dur="4.11">you know like in monsters Inc they they</text>
  <text start="1007.43" dur="4.5">create energy they create their economy</text>
  <text start="1009.77" dur="4.23">by scaring the hell out of kids I went</text>
  <text start="1011.93" dur="3.3">back into the the 80s I think it was and</text>
  <text start="1014" dur="3.6">I watched a movie I remember as a kid</text>
  <text start="1015.23" dur="5.1">called a little monster it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="1017.6" dur="4.29">damn narrative they go at one point the</text>
  <text start="1020.33" dur="3.84">monster comes out from under the bed he</text>
  <text start="1021.89" dur="4.47">coerces the child with lots of touching</text>
  <text start="1024.17" dur="4.2">and weird stuff underneath the bed</text>
  <text start="1026.36" dur="3.69">eventually there&amp;#39;s a bunch of monsters</text>
  <text start="1028.37" dur="4.26">in this kid trying to convince the kid</text>
  <text start="1030.05" dur="4.98">to hurt the baby as a group in another</text>
  <text start="1032.63" dur="3.45">room or like torturing a baby and</text>
  <text start="1035.03" dur="2.55">they&amp;#39;re trying to think it&amp;#39;s fun and</text>
  <text start="1036.08" dur="2.85">encouraged the challenge and I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1037.58" dur="3.41">thinking like how long has this been</text>
  <text start="1038.93" dur="6.18">going on it&amp;#39;s been there the whole time</text>
  <text start="1040.99" dur="5.86">so you know seeing the escape of that</text>
  <text start="1045.11" dur="4.89">kind of stuff and that kind of as you</text>
  <text start="1046.85" dur="6.03">were saying the stories I do see a</text>
  <text start="1050" dur="6.51">better world beyond this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1052.88" dur="6.5">unbelievable to think about what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1056.51" dur="6.3">built around this darkness and if we</text>
  <text start="1059.38" dur="5.66">pull away this darkness what we can</text>
  <text start="1062.81" dur="3.88">build instead it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1065.04" dur="4.97">boundless honestly it&amp;#39;s totally</text>
  <text start="1066.69" dur="6.74">boundless and you know there&amp;#39;s no more</text>
  <text start="1070.01" dur="6.13">you know power has been so centralized</text>
  <text start="1073.43" dur="5.35">because of this you there&amp;#39;s only a</text>
  <text start="1076.14" dur="6.06">handful of people who are willing to</text>
  <text start="1078.78" dur="6.24">really partake in this system so at that</text>
  <text start="1082.2" dur="4.23">you know in terms of having to do these</text>
  <text start="1085.02" dur="3.42">things and sell your soul and having to</text>
  <text start="1086.43" dur="4.08">participate in these things and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1088.44" dur="4.32">um and then of course two people are</text>
  <text start="1090.51" dur="5.37">going into it and these elite sort of</text>
  <text start="1092.76" dur="5.19">families and and all this goes on but if</text>
  <text start="1095.88" dur="5.4">you think about it that&amp;#39;s in a way how</text>
  <text start="1097.95" dur="5.4">powers been centralized so at once it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1101.28" dur="4.86">no longer the power structure over the</text>
  <text start="1103.35" dur="4.68">system power is going to decentralize</text>
  <text start="1106.14" dur="3.81">across the planet and there&amp;#39;s just sort</text>
  <text start="1108.03" dur="4.74">of that&amp;#39;s just sort of the log you know</text>
  <text start="1109.95" dur="6.24">energy I don&amp;#39;t really know the log sort</text>
  <text start="1112.77" dur="5.04">of yeah it&amp;#39;s funny because you say that</text>

  <text start="1805.44" dur="4.53">that the context and the content is very</text>
  <text start="1807.78" dur="4.47">suspect and I suspect that very soon</text>
  <text start="1809.97" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re gonna see this as part of a piece</text>

  <text start="2026.639" dur="3.721">lockstep we see the problem we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2028.38" dur="3.539">identified it you know if millions of</text>
  <text start="2030.36" dur="3.75">people are waking up sort of a Great</text>
