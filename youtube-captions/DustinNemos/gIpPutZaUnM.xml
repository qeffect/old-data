  <text start="9080.12" dur="9.15">our country do us to us I mean our</text>
  <text start="9084.11" dur="7.56">country and then what do I say I say the</text>
  <text start="9089.27" dur="5.22">United States Attorney General Turney</text>
  <text start="9091.67" dur="5.28">General of the United States could speak</text>
  <text start="9094.49" dur="4.95">to you would be great okay because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="9096.95" dur="5.61">known for major corruption in fact the</text>
  <text start="9099.44" dur="7.2">new leader of Ukraine got in on a</text>
  <text start="9102.56" dur="6.09">construction on a a platform where he</text>
  <text start="9106.64" dur="4.23">looks for all of the problems of</text>
  <text start="9108.65" dur="3.22">dishonesty and everything that was going</text>
  <text start="9110.87" dur="3.25">on in Ukraine</text>
  <text start="9111.87" dur="5.79">right he looked for it that&amp;#39;s how he got</text>
  <text start="9114.12" dur="8.01">into office he got into office that way</text>
  <text start="9117.66" dur="7.41">so we take it and they repeat it a</text>
  <text start="9122.13" dur="5.58">thousand times and they never say with</text>
  <text start="9125.07" dur="4.44">the right so I go wild and we start and</text>
  <text start="9127.71" dur="3.72">the Republicans have got a right now we</text>
  <text start="9129.51" dur="5.219">always correct him but I used the word</text>
  <text start="9131.43" dur="5.719">us us is the United States our country</text>
  <text start="9134.729" dur="5.911">and then it actually says I think comma</text>
  <text start="9137.149" dur="6.281">country but they don&amp;#39;t say that they say</text>
  <text start="9140.64" dur="5.28">do me a favor how many times have you</text>
  <text start="9143.43" dur="4.91">heard it where they say it is speech and</text>
  <text start="9145.92" dur="4.89">then the president said do me a favor</text>
  <text start="9148.34" dur="5.68">well that&amp;#39;s not what I said</text>
  <text start="9150.81" dur="5.52">I said do us a favor our country and</text>
  <text start="9154.02" dur="4.08">then I said the Attorney General of the</text>
  <text start="9156.33" dur="4.62">United States I didn&amp;#39;t say my campaign</text>
  <text start="9158.1" dur="5.15">manager okay I said the attorney and</text>
  <text start="9160.95" dur="9.93">these people want to impeach the</text>
  <text start="9163.25" dur="9.28">President of the United States oh and</text>
  <text start="9170.88" dur="5.309">then what happened right then what</text>
  <text start="9172.53" dur="6.869">happened so then the president of</text>
  <text start="9176.189" dur="6.571">Ukraine who&amp;#39;s a quality person said</text>
  <text start="9179.399" dur="4.951">there was no pressure exerted whatsoever</text>
  <text start="9182.76" dur="4.2">that was a killer for the Democrats</text>
  <text start="9184.35" dur="5.81">right then his foreign minister said the</text>
  <text start="9186.96" dur="6.8">same thing he said there was no pressure</text>
  <text start="9190.16" dur="7.029">exerted whatsoever there was no pressure</text>
  <text start="9193.76" dur="5.639">that&amp;#39;s a killer so now did you see what</text>
  <text start="9197.189" dur="5.941">the Democrats did a couple of days ago</text>
  <text start="9199.399" dur="7.241">they tried to say that he&amp;#39;s not a strong</text>
  <text start="9203.13" dur="6.21">person that he was weak they used the</text>
  <text start="9206.64" dur="6.6">word weak that he was weak and under the</text>
  <text start="9209.34" dur="6.059">power of trouble he said do you know how</text>
  <text start="9213.24" dur="4.619">insulting that is anybody that becomes</text>
  <text start="9215.399" dur="4.891">president of a country and that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="9217.859" dur="5.551">country and it&amp;#39;s a tough country he</text>
  <text start="9220.29" dur="4.68">gotta be tough he&amp;#39;s tough but so what</text>
  <text start="9223.41" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re saying now is he was weak</text>
  <text start="9224.97" dur="6.03">because the wording is just doesn&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="9227.46" dur="6.269">okay these are really dishonest people</text>
  <text start="9231" dur="5.75">and if the press was fair this thing</text>
  <text start="9233.729" dur="3.021">never would have happened</text>
  <text start="9238.069" dur="6.75">so the House Democrats are surrendering</text>
  <text start="9241.909" dur="5.13">their majority their dignity their</text>
  <text start="9244.819" dur="5.25">reputations they look like a bunch of</text>
