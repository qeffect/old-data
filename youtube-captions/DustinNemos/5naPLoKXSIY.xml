  <text start="24.359" dur="4.861">Congress who has been to Pyongyang I did</text>
  <text start="26.49" dur="4.83">a number of years ago as a member of the</text>
  <text start="29.22" dur="4.38">Intelligence Committee it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="31.32" dur="6.57">frightening place that you know it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="33.6" dur="6.06">case that is when I&amp;#39;ve seen poverty</text>
  <text start="37.89" dur="4.68">throughout America I mean throughout the</text>

  <text start="45.42" dur="4.26">they might be in the alleviation of</text>
  <text start="47.129" dur="4.651">poverty the eradication of disease I</text>
  <text start="49.68" dur="5.129">went to North Korea</text>
  <text start="51.78" dur="6.48">I saw a poverty of spirit that just was</text>
  <text start="54.809" dur="6.3">mind-boggling in many respects and and</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s a difficult place we work</text>
  <text start="61.109" dur="6.33">our purpose then was to say you want to</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="8.49">talk about ma mi Rae&amp;#39;s and POWs we want</text>
  <text start="67.439" dur="7.561">you to stop proliferating selling your</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="4.74">missile technology issues like that</text>
  <text start="75" dur="4.02">checking in on the hunger situation cuz</text>
  <text start="77.1" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;re people were starving even though</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="4.83">their motto was self-reliance they</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="5.43">couldn&amp;#39;t feed their own people and so</text>
  <text start="83.85" dur="4.86">what they&amp;#39;re told us that so what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="86.25" dur="7.56">relevant to now is they said hey we just</text>
  <text start="88.71" dur="5.61">sell these missile this technology for</text>
  <text start="93.81" dur="2.849">money</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="6.06">you never buy them we&amp;#39;ll sell them to</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="6.861">you and so what my guidance from there</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="6.349">to the current situation is the</text>
  <text start="103.52" dur="7.09">capability of the North Koreans to</text>
  <text start="106.729" dur="8.021">create either the technology for for a</text>
  <text start="110.61" dur="7.02">weapon the miniaturization of it the</text>
  <text start="114.75" dur="5.549">capacity to launch it and the intention</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="4.769">to do so was something that we need to</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="4.981">know as much of that as possible but in</text>
  <text start="122.399" dur="5.67">addition to that they&amp;#39;re proliferators</text>
  <text start="125.28" dur="5.19">and this is what I keep saying to</text>
  <text start="128.069" dur="4.351">and initiation they are proliferate or</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="4.29">so the danger is not just what they</text>
  <text start="132.42" dur="6.09">might do the danger is who they might</text>
  <text start="134.76" dur="6.42">sell one element of that to which might</text>
  <text start="138.51" dur="8.22">be enough to endanger the world</text>
  <text start="141.18" dur="8.91">even further so hopeful hopeful</text>
  <text start="146.73" dur="5.19">conversation maybe Kim jong-un is ready</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="6.66">to change I wouldn&amp;#39;t be to test whether</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="7.439">but certainly open to it and what would</text>
  <text start="156.75" dur="4.95">be success if at least the communication</text>
  <text start="159.359" dur="8.49">were increased and there could be some</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="8.819">way to stop what could follow if left</text>
  <text start="167.849" dur="6.48">undeterred North Korea would continue</text>
  <text start="170.519" dur="7.021">what it&amp;#39;s doing which is perhaps other</text>
  <text start="174.329" dur="5.16">countries having access to the top the</text>
  <text start="177.54" dur="5.009">technology the scientific know-how the</text>
