  <text start="339.09" dur="11.96">organization called voices for vaccines</text>
  <text start="343.43" dur="12.07">which is a group of lay people who are</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="7.99">favorable to vaccination and she had</text>

  <text start="378.66" dur="9.02">to testify I have not talked to the</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="5.84">father I&amp;#39;ve never met the father so I</text>
  <text start="387.98" dur="5.98">everything is has happened second hand</text>
  <text start="391.23" dur="4.62">so to speak and it was Karen Ernst who</text>
  <text start="393.96" dur="4.9">who asked you to be an expert in this</text>
  <text start="395.85" dur="4.45">case she asked me if I would be willing</text>

  <text start="400.3" dur="7.47">had with her no discussions about this</text>

  <text start="444.9" dur="4.68">opposing counsel and an email</text>
  <text start="447.629" dur="5.4">communication with Karen Ernst you have</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="4.859">not discussed this lawsuit this</text>
  <text start="453.029" dur="3.121">deposition or the role that you&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="454.439" dur="7.891">playing here today with anybody else is</text>
  <text start="456.15" dur="15.03">that right I&amp;#39;ve had a email exchange</text>
  <text start="462.33" dur="13.199">with Paul Offit dr. Paul Offit who was</text>
  <text start="471.18" dur="7.849">actually a former student of mine and</text>

  <text start="493.729" dur="5.86">refusal to vaccinate okay and what was</text>
  <text start="497.25" dur="6.02">the substance of those discussions the</text>
  <text start="499.589" dur="7.76">substance they basically concern what</text>
  <text start="503.27" dur="6.069">arguments are often used to oppose</text>
  <text start="507.349" dur="5.411">vaccinations and what are those</text>
  <text start="509.339" dur="10.01">arguments the arguments generally are</text>
  <text start="512.76" dur="9.509">that vaccines can cause reactions and</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="7.631">that the reactions are worse than the</text>
  <text start="522.269" dur="8.851">disease and what did dr. often have to</text>
  <text start="526.98" dur="7.44">say about that well he pointed out of</text>
  <text start="531.12" dur="7.32">course and he&amp;#39;s the author of a chapter</text>
  <text start="534.42" dur="7.979">in my vaccines book that the opposite is</text>
  <text start="538.44" dur="6.69">true that the disease is worse than the</text>
  <text start="542.399" dur="4.171">reactions to the vaccines do you have</text>
  <text start="545.13" dur="3.36">peer-reviewed science to support that</text>

  <text start="552.149" dur="4.201">science well the science is in the</text>
  <text start="555.089" dur="5.961">chapter and my</text>

  <text start="693.96" dur="7.2">and why do you believe they&amp;#39;re appalling</text>

  <text start="2200.99" dur="5.02">yeah that&amp;#39;s pretty much the case and in</text>

  <text start="2206.01" dur="6.84">there are a limited number of vaccine</text>

  <text start="2212.85" dur="6">manufacturer is difficult and costly</text>
  <text start="2216.65" dur="4.6">would it be correct to call these four</text>
  <text start="2218.85" dur="6.47">companies the big four vaccine</text>
  <text start="2221.25" dur="9.869">manufacturers yes that&amp;#39;s correct</text>

  <text start="2242.52" dur="5.22">of its related or predecessor entities</text>
  <text start="2244.56" dur="7.77">yes certainly okay in what years did you</text>
  <text start="2247.74" dur="9.68">receive payments well first of all as</text>
  <text start="2252.33" dur="7.68">you should know in the 1990s I was a</text>
  <text start="2257.42" dur="9.189">medical and scientific director of</text>
  <text start="2260.01" dur="12.41">sanofi pasteur and so obviously I was</text>
  <text start="2266.609" dur="10.441">paid by them and since then I&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="2290.01" dur="7.91">remunerated by companies not by</text>
  <text start="2295.25" dur="7.799">nonprofits obviously</text>
  <text start="2297.92" dur="7.799">and that is essentially what I do is</text>
  <text start="2303.049" dur="4.5">there a year since 1990 that you have</text>
  <text start="2305.719" dur="8.15">not received any kind of payment or</text>
  <text start="2307.549" dur="6.32">remuneration from Sanofi probably not no</text>
  <text start="2314.38" dur="13.27">how much did you receive what would you</text>

  <text start="2388.729" dur="8.1">be more than a million do you believe it</text>

  <text start="2636.66" dur="10.02">well I can say is since I stopped</text>
  <text start="2641.11" dur="7.97">working for Sanofi which was in early</text>
  <text start="2646.68" dur="9.07">2000s</text>
  <text start="2649.08" dur="10.87">I&amp;#39;ve consulted for essentially all of</text>

  <text start="2691.49" dur="5.94">payments remuneration from Merck since</text>

  <text start="2697.43" dur="6.06">records that would be able to determine</text>
  <text start="2701.3" dur="5.1">that amount correct yes</text>
  <text start="2703.49" dur="7.34">I doubt actually I doubt this a hundred</text>
  <text start="2706.4" dur="7.38">thousand but I I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t recall I</text>
  <text start="2710.83" dur="5.05">as I said my wife does the accounting</text>
  <text start="2713.78" dur="5.1">and I pay no attention to it</text>
  <text start="2715.88" dur="4.469">do you anticipate pursuing any payments</text>
  <text start="2718.88" dur="5.67">for me naration from Merck in the future</text>

  <text start="2747.8" dur="8.809">consulting for many different entities</text>
  <text start="2750.82" dur="8.47">including GSK and and the others do you</text>
  <text start="2756.609" dur="4.331">expect to continue to receive payments</text>
  <text start="2759.29" dur="7.14">from interation from GSK in the future</text>
  <text start="2760.94" dur="8.429">yes I lost you the same question about</text>
