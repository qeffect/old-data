  <text start="48.079" dur="2.73">interesting conversation I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="49.28" dur="4.47">looking forward to it for a while</text>
  <text start="50.809" dur="5.401">vaccines being a very censored topic</text>
  <text start="53.75" dur="4.589">right now so what what has your</text>
  <text start="56.21" dur="4.259">experience been and you know I&amp;#39;ll let</text>
  <text start="58.339" dur="3.871">you introduce yourself and kind of tell</text>
  <text start="60.469" dur="5.131">us what inspired you to write these</text>
  <text start="62.21" dur="5.4">books yeah well I&amp;#39;ve been in this fight</text>
  <text start="65.6" dur="5.07">for about 18 years ever since my</text>
  <text start="67.61" dur="4.53">daughter was vaccine injured and I came</text>
  <text start="70.67" dur="3.69">to understand that she was vaccine</text>
  <text start="72.14" dur="3.96">injured what happened was I actually</text>
  <text start="74.36" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t understand that my daughter was</text>
  <text start="76.1" dur="4.26">vaccine injured because looking back at</text>
  <text start="78.38" dur="5.22">it I think that she was injured at about</text>
  <text start="80.36" dur="4.95">six months and you know at six months a</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="5.28">child is you know not really doing that</text>
  <text start="85.31" dur="7.17">much that&amp;#39;s interesting and it really</text>
  <text start="88.88" dur="5.73">had to wait until my son Ben was 18</text>
  <text start="92.48" dur="4.26">months and I actually took him to his 18</text>
  <text start="94.61" dur="3.45">month checkup and because I thought the</text>
  <text start="96.74" dur="4.56">doctor had missed something at my</text>
  <text start="98.06" dur="5.73">daughter&amp;#39;s six-month checkup he went</text>
  <text start="101.3" dur="4.2">through a full developmental workup he</text>
  <text start="103.79" dur="3.63">was saying 1520 words looking</text>
  <text start="105.5" dur="4.05">appropriately Ghana shot so I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="107.42" dur="3.78">even thinking of it three days later he</text>
  <text start="109.55" dur="4.26">was putting his head on the floor my</text>
  <text start="111.2" dur="6.66">wife said that he has not is not</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="6.78">speaking anymore and luckily through the</text>
  <text start="117.86" dur="5.16">grace of God within a couple days I ran</text>
  <text start="120.59" dur="5.7">across gluten casein free diet put him</text>
  <text start="123.02" dur="5.01">on it after 12 days and very quickly and</text>
  <text start="126.29" dur="5.339">after 12 days he said his first word</text>
  <text start="128.03" dur="5.01">again and who&amp;#39;s as if I had caught him</text>
  <text start="131.629" dur="5.22">as soon as falling into the abyss of</text>
  <text start="133.04" dur="6">autism and my wife&amp;#39;s a speech therapist</text>
  <text start="136.849" dur="4.081">and what she always says is that it took</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="4.32">him about a year to catch up in language</text>
  <text start="140.93" dur="4.32">to where his peers were and it took him</text>
  <text start="143.36" dur="2.13">about two years for sensory problems to</text>
  <text start="145.25" dur="4.71">go</text>
  <text start="145.49" dur="6.48">way but you know he entered kindergarten</text>
  <text start="149.96" dur="5.76">is a normally developing I&amp;#39;ve year-old</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="8.1">he&amp;#39;s 19 years old he&amp;#39;s a weightlifter he</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="6.96">he will deadlift over 500 pounds even</text>
  <text start="160.07" dur="4.89">though he&amp;#39;s 140 pounds he is an</text>
  <text start="162.68" dur="4.08">accountant and you know I have a</text>
  <text start="164.96" dur="3.96">daughter who&amp;#39;s still very severely</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="4.14">impaired and has trouble walking so I</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="4.44">know it just can&amp;#39;t be the genetics and</text>
  <text start="170.9" dur="5.01">you know when that moment happened that</text>
  <text start="173.36" dur="4.56">I realized that this crazy theory that</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="4.26">yeah I didn&amp;#39;t believe you know I&amp;#39;d heard</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="5.55">about it but I hadn&amp;#39;t investigated well</text>
  <text start="180.17" dur="5.1">when I heard this wouldn&amp;#39;t I saw the</text>
  <text start="183.47" dur="4.92">evidence for myself because you couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="185.27" dur="5.01">say you know with my son being hurt by</text>
  <text start="188.39" dur="4.77">his vaccines or suddenly going silent</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="5.19">after his 18-month checkup oh maybe</text>
  <text start="193.16" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s a coincidence but to see him come</text>
  <text start="195.47" dur="5.43">back so dramatically just said to me</text>
  <text start="198.59" dur="3.99">something&amp;#39;s going on here and you know I</text>
  <text start="200.9" dur="4.2">always say that I felt like it was a</text>
  <text start="202.58" dur="5.58">moment where I&amp;#39;m in communication with</text>
  <text start="205.1" dur="5.28">God and God is asking me I have shown</text>
  <text start="208.16" dur="3.93">you this clearly Kent now what are you</text>
  <text start="210.38" dur="3.81">gonna do about it and I just kind of</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="4.68">felt like you know from now into my diet</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="5.13">and a I&amp;#39;m gonna tell the truth and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="216.77" dur="4.65">not gonna worry about what friends I</text>
  <text start="219.32" dur="5.82">lose I don&amp;#39;t care if family members turn</text>
  <text start="221.42" dur="5.88">away from me but this is this is a godly</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="4.29">fight you know someday I&amp;#39;m gonna die and</text>
  <text start="227.3" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m gonna you know meet god and goddess</text>
  <text start="229.43" dur="3.54">didn&amp;#39;t ask me what I did in this</text>
  <text start="230.78" dur="3.38">terrible crisis and I you know what I</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="4.17">want to have a good answer</text>
  <text start="234.16" dur="5.17">sure and you know what to add something</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="5.34">to that I&amp;#39;m no science teacher but I</text>
  <text start="239.33" dur="5.01">imagine that I heard of first all maybe</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="3.48">some context I heard a story of triplets</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="3.63">that were all vaccine injured by one</text>
  <text start="245.96" dur="4.59">vaccine and gave an autism in the same</text>
  <text start="247.97" dur="5.19">day yeah one of them I think was a girl</text>
  <text start="250.55" dur="4.89">and two of them were boys yeah fully</text>
  <text start="253.16" dur="3.75">understand the genetics of that but as I</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="2.79">understand it that disproves the</text>
  <text start="256.91" dur="3.42">genetics theory because it would</text>
  <text start="258.23" dur="5.25">typically affect girls and boys</text>
  <text start="260.33" dur="5.7">differently all else being equal so</text>
  <text start="263.48" dur="4.92">there are cases like that where we have</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="4.17">some established idea that it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="4.11">genetic right do you have any comment</text>
  <text start="270.2" dur="3.9">for that yeah you know I think that</text>
  <text start="272.51" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s a number of factors that are</text>
  <text start="274.1" dur="4.39">going on one of the things that is</text>
  <text start="276.35" dur="5.83">bringing up</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="6.269">the role of cow&amp;#39;s milk in causing</text>
  <text start="282.18" dur="7.47">certain types of allergies which I think</text>
  <text start="284.759" dur="8.761">predispose kids to vaccine injury so for</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="6.629">example my daughter went off of breast</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="5.579">milk at about six months and we gave her</text>
  <text start="296.279" dur="6.45">a regular cow&amp;#39;s milk formula she also</text>
  <text start="299.099" dur="5.43">had a series of ear infections which</text>
  <text start="302.729" dur="3.09">were treated with antibiotics too now</text>
  <text start="304.529" dur="3.92">that we understand more about the gut</text>
  <text start="305.819" dur="5.581">microbiome we understand that</text>
  <text start="308.449" dur="6.101">antibiotics and - you know they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="5.519">a nuclear bomb to the microbiome and so</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="5.07">I think that rendered her as more</text>
  <text start="316.919" dur="5.49">susceptible to harm now with my son for</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="4.829">reasons it&amp;#39;s unrelated to autism we had</text>
  <text start="322.409" dur="3.931">him on a hypoallergenic milk formula</text>
  <text start="324.449" dur="4.02">until he was about 15 months old and</text>
  <text start="326.34" dur="4.889">then you know because it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="328.469" dur="5.431">expensive we switched him backs so I</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="5.641">think being on the hypoallergenic milk</text>
  <text start="333.9" dur="5.37">formula sort of protected my son from</text>
  <text start="336.87" dur="6.109">back singing damage so there there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="6.69">multiple factors but what has been</text>
  <text start="342.979" dur="6.331">really dramatic to me and I was just</text>
  <text start="345.96" dur="7.85">talking to dr. Shiva ayyadurai</text>
  <text start="349.31" dur="7.539">about this idea of you know in regular</text>
  <text start="353.81" dur="5.409">consumer products if the customers</text>
  <text start="356.849" dur="5.701">complain the manufacturers have to</text>
  <text start="359.219" dur="5.82">respond and what has been remarkable to</text>
  <text start="362.55" dur="4.38">me is that there&amp;#39;s so many people like</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="5.13">me talking about the problems of our</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="4.799">kids and and we&amp;#39;re just censored or you</text>
  <text start="370.169" dur="4.411">know we&amp;#39;re kept off of the airwaves</text>
  <text start="371.729" dur="4.74">since I&amp;#39;ve been in this fighting for a</text>
  <text start="374.58" dur="4.019">long time it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really you hear a</text>
  <text start="376.469" dur="3.861">lot of stories and you know I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="378.599" dur="4.921">stuck at home because I still have very</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="5.049">severely disabled a child so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="3.569">really able to you know go to the</text>
  <text start="385.379" dur="3.81">conferences and things like that so I</text>
  <text start="387.089" dur="4.2">try to do the best that I can from my</text>
  <text start="389.189" dur="4.051">home but you know we hear I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="4.68">stories over the years of you know our</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="5.519">people are at network news or getting</text>
  <text start="395.969" dur="5.16">ready to go on and suddenly an attorney</text>
  <text start="398.759" dur="4.08">for the pharmaceutical company shows up</text>
  <text start="401.129" dur="3.081">and says you can&amp;#39;t have those people on</text>
  <text start="402.839" dur="6.591">and</text>
  <text start="404.21" dur="8.19">what we know from the from just open</text>
  <text start="409.43" dur="6.6">source reporting is that the</text>
  <text start="412.4" dur="6.15">pharmaceutical company donates to the</text>
  <text start="416.03" dur="5.37">evening news a 50 to 60 percent of the</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="5.16">evening news is sponsored by big pharma</text>
  <text start="421.4" dur="4.92">various aspects of it so you know</text>
  <text start="423.71" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s no incentive for the it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.32" dur="4.349">actually a disincentive for the news</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="4.41">networks not to cover these stories</text>
  <text start="430.669" dur="4.711">unless they absolutely have to what we</text>
  <text start="433.28" dur="5.43">also know is that the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="435.38" dur="5.58">industry has twice to three times the</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="4.56">amount of lobbyists in Washington as</text>
  <text start="440.96" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s this closest competitor which is</text>
  <text start="443.27" dur="6.989">big oil and big ass so you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="446.78" dur="6.449">sort of like this invisible part of in</text>
  <text start="450.259" dur="6.271">invisible network of influence that big</text>
  <text start="453.229" dur="5.581">has over our discussion well you know</text>
  <text start="456.53" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s part of the swamp as they call</text>
  <text start="458.81" dur="3.75">it at the deep state but at the other</text>
  <text start="460.16" dur="4.08">side of that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just basic human</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="3.389">incentive like they&amp;#39;re gonna mess with</text>
  <text start="464.24" dur="3.81">their money in a big way if they try to</text>
  <text start="465.949" dur="4.381">take on big pharma because the incentive</text>
  <text start="468.05" dur="4.29">structures the drug ads every 30 seconds</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="5.13">the you know the the side effects that</text>
  <text start="472.34" dur="5.13">could include you know comas or death or</text>
  <text start="475.46" dur="4.199">I think I&amp;#39;ve even heard some of these</text>
  <text start="477.47" dur="5.33">big pharma pills have a side effect of</text>
  <text start="479.659" dur="6.57">flesh-eating genital bacteria or virus</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="5.71">just okay you don&amp;#39;t want that one so you</text>
  <text start="486.229" dur="4.291">know in in as you said in a normal</text>
  <text start="488.51" dur="3.54">situation these companies have to in a</text>
  <text start="490.52" dur="3.3">free-market situation these companies</text>
  <text start="492.05" dur="4.38">have to respond to their customers or</text>
  <text start="493.82" dur="5.099">their clients but that brings up vaccine</text>
  <text start="496.43" dur="4.769">court you know they have immunity so the</text>
  <text start="498.919" dur="3.391">government pays their their liabilities</text>
  <text start="501.199" dur="3.571">and debts for them while they make</text>
  <text start="502.31" dur="5.16">billions in profit on each vaccine every</text>
  <text start="504.77" dur="4.739">year and there&amp;#39;s no real justice there</text>
  <text start="507.47" dur="3.479">we&amp;#39;ve talked about you know open source</text>
  <text start="509.509" dur="4.141">investigation we have the CDC</text>
  <text start="510.949" dur="4.411">whistleblowers we have the work of dr.</text>
  <text start="513.65" dur="3.569">Andrew Wakefield linking autism to</text>
  <text start="515.36" dur="4.65">vaccines which was ridiculed and then</text>
  <text start="517.219" dur="3.961">later vindicated by The Lancet and you</text>
  <text start="520.01" dur="3.81">know we have all of these different</text>
  <text start="521.18" dur="4.74">examples of big pharma the revolving</text>
  <text start="523.82" dur="5.759">door between Big Pharma and and the</text>
  <text start="525.92" dur="5.789">government and FDA so you bring up a lot</text>
  <text start="529.579" dur="4.441">of good points so there&amp;#39;s no real</text>
  <text start="531.709" dur="4.38">justice to be found there&amp;#39;s this war on</text>
  <text start="534.02" dur="3.4">people in terms of trying to vaccinate</text>
  <text start="536.089" dur="3.521">all these children and then</text>
  <text start="537.42" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s a real war on those who have</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="3.9">been hurt by this the victims they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.92" dur="3.78">being attacked all the more when they</text>
  <text start="543.51" dur="4.89">speak out which is a brave thing to do I</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="4.89">mean you you challenge the whole</text>
  <text start="548.4" dur="3.66">paradigm when you do that and and you</text>
  <text start="550.59" dur="3.66">spoke about your your children being</text>
  <text start="552.06" dur="4.02">lured by vaccines I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve met a lot of</text>
  <text start="554.25" dur="4.44">families who were vaccine injured and</text>
  <text start="556.08" dur="8.04">have vaccinated families and children</text>
  <text start="558.69" dur="7.86">and I spoke with autism one and of Tiger</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="4.38">moms that have heard babies I mean I</text>
  <text start="566.55" dur="3.57">could barely be there without breaking</text>
  <text start="568.5" dur="3.96">down in tears because it was such a sad</text>
  <text start="570.12" dur="5.61">story there&amp;#39;s so many folks who are</text>
  <text start="572.46" dur="4.74">standing up there they&amp;#39;re meeting people</text>
  <text start="575.73" dur="3.42">like them they&amp;#39;re sharing their stories</text>
  <text start="577.2" dur="3.6">their victimhood and they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="579.15" dur="4.41">pushing back and that&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="580.8" dur="4.65">important thing to see so kind of a long</text>
  <text start="583.56" dur="4.02">winded way to come back around to it but</text>
  <text start="585.45" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re absolutely right this is a rigged</text>
  <text start="587.58" dur="4.53">system and what do you think we could do</text>
  <text start="589.35" dur="5.01">about that well you know I&amp;#39;m always a</text>
  <text start="592.11" dur="4.56">big believer and you know understanding</text>
  <text start="594.36" dur="4.65">that people will have different views of</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="4.05">things so it&amp;#39;s not just that we have to</text>
  <text start="599.01" dur="4.05">have sort of like a model that they</text>
  <text start="600.72" dur="5.07">point of view so when I engage with</text>
  <text start="603.06" dur="4.53">people who are very Pro vaccine I say</text>
  <text start="605.79" dur="4.32">okay I understand we can have different</text>
  <text start="607.59" dur="4.04">viewpoints on this issue but let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="610.11" dur="4.32">if we can come up with a common solution</text>
  <text start="611.63" dur="6.4">so other things that people who believe</text>
  <text start="614.43" dur="5.28">in vaccines say is it vaccines are safe</text>
  <text start="618.03" dur="3.51">for sugar water I mean it&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="619.71" dur="4.35">vaccines are saying effective and I say</text>
  <text start="621.54" dur="6.21">okay well I don&amp;#39;t believe that but you</text>
  <text start="624.06" dur="6.3">do so but let&amp;#39;s see if we can come to</text>
  <text start="627.75" dur="4.41">some sort of common ground so if you</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="4.77">believe that vaccines are really safe</text>
  <text start="632.16" dur="6.54">then I would like you to support me in</text>
  <text start="635.13" dur="5.43">my call to get rid of the vaccine court</text>
  <text start="638.7" dur="4.26">and see if we put vaccines in the</text>
  <text start="640.56" dur="6">regular civil court system because I</text>
  <text start="642.96" dur="7.14">think that that one change would would</text>
  <text start="646.56" dur="4.17">really change this issue dramatically or</text>
  <text start="650.1" dur="3.06">not</text>
  <text start="650.73" dur="4.74">yeah because you know one of the things</text>
  <text start="653.16" dur="5.67">that a lot of people don&amp;#39;t understand is</text>
  <text start="655.47" dur="5.76">that regular pharmaceutical medications</text>
  <text start="658.83" dur="4.95">they have a certain system under which</text>
  <text start="661.23" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re under which you know yes we can</text>
  <text start="663.78" dur="4.77">have a terrible situation like Vioxx</text>
  <text start="665.79" dur="4.59">where it kills many thousands of people</text>
  <text start="668.55" dur="2.13">but eventually the courts are going to</text>
  <text start="670.38" dur="2.399">catch</text>
  <text start="670.68" dur="4.65">shop to that and you know they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="672.779" dur="5.551">be big fines the druggist pulled from</text>
  <text start="675.33" dur="6.449">the market and the system will work I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="678.33" dur="5.1">be you know poorly and slowly it will</text>
  <text start="681.779" dur="4.021">work we don&amp;#39;t have anything like that in</text>
  <text start="683.43" dur="4.38">vaccines and so you know I say to those</text>
  <text start="685.8" dur="2.49">people who you know vehemently disagree</text>
  <text start="687.81" dur="2.94">with me</text>
  <text start="688.29" dur="4.29">well can we agree on this one thing</text>
  <text start="690.75" dur="4.589">let&amp;#39;s just get rid of vaccine courts and</text>
  <text start="692.58" dur="6.96">you know what&amp;#39;s really interesting in in</text>
  <text start="695.339" dur="7.981">my book inoculated what I actually did</text>
  <text start="699.54" dur="6.78">was I interviewed the chief special</text>
  <text start="703.32" dur="4.769">master that&amp;#39;s equivalent to the Chief</text>
  <text start="706.32" dur="4.079">Justice of the Supreme Court Chief</text>
  <text start="708.089" dur="5.761">special master of the vaccine court a</text>
  <text start="710.399" dur="6.601">guy named Gary Galka was and he was very</text>
  <text start="713.85" dur="4.92">eloquent in terms of saying that you</text>
  <text start="717" dur="4.08">know talking about all the problems with</text>
  <text start="718.77" dur="4.02">vaccine court and you know to his credit</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="3.81">even though nice had brought up the</text>
  <text start="722.79" dur="4.23">things like well what about that Simpson</text>
  <text start="724.89" dur="4.17">would conference what about William</text>
  <text start="727.02" dur="2.819">Thompson what about you know these other</text>
  <text start="729.06" dur="5.219">people</text>
  <text start="729.839" dur="7.171">he actually had said well as a judge we</text>
  <text start="734.279" dur="4.981">can only rule on what&amp;#39;s given to us so</text>
  <text start="737.01" dur="5.34">if we&amp;#39;re not given the information we</text>
  <text start="739.26" dur="4.59">can&amp;#39;t really rule correctly and you know</text>
  <text start="742.35" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s interesting to talk to this guy who</text>
  <text start="743.85" dur="4.35">you know going into it and you know in</text>
  <text start="746.13" dur="5.07">my view of the world this guy probably</text>
  <text start="748.2" dur="6.18">had horns and you know a pitchfork and a</text>
  <text start="751.2" dur="5.94">tail and cloven hoofs and and we really</text>
  <text start="754.38" dur="5.31">believe the same thing the other person</text>
  <text start="757.14" dur="6.54">that I interviewed was this law</text>
  <text start="759.69" dur="5.82">professor from Stanford University Nora</text>
  <text start="763.68" dur="3.42">Freeman Engstrom who was one of the few</text>
  <text start="765.51" dur="4.32">academics to look at how well the</text>
  <text start="767.1" dur="4.29">vaccine court is working and she said it</text>
  <text start="769.83" dur="3.33">very much the same thing you know it was</text>
  <text start="771.39" dur="4.68">supposed to be this quick way of</text>
  <text start="773.16" dur="4.65">compensation you know supposed to give</text>
  <text start="776.07" dur="4.59">compensation to parents within six</text>
  <text start="777.81" dur="5.94">months of you know reporting an injury</text>
  <text start="780.66" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s not done anything like that and the</text>
  <text start="783.75" dur="5.1">interesting thing and this is something</text>
  <text start="786.15" dur="6.15">that I struggle with because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="788.85" dur="5.429">quite understand what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="792.3" dur="3.51">psychology of people I have they studied</text>
  <text start="794.279" dur="4.891">a lot of this night I still don&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="795.81" dur="6.84">have a good answer is it is both Gary</text>
  <text start="799.17" dur="5.039">Galka wits and Nora Freeman Engstrom I</text>
  <text start="802.65" dur="4.77">said okay given all</text>
  <text start="804.209" dur="6.23">these criticisms that you have made of</text>
  <text start="807.42" dur="6.209">the vaccine court can you tell me that</text>
  <text start="810.439" dur="6.551">this vaccine court has protected the</text>
  <text start="813.629" dur="7.56">American public and both of them said</text>
  <text start="816.99" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s been on my ability to say and I</text>
  <text start="821.189" dur="4.08">found myself really troubled by because</text>
  <text start="822.99" dur="4.409">I mean on the one hand I I you know</text>
  <text start="825.269" dur="4.081">plotted there honestly about that you</text>
  <text start="827.399" dur="4.53">know they did give me some corporate</text>
  <text start="829.35" dur="5.07">line but you know I actually kind of</text>
  <text start="831.929" dur="4.801">wanted a little bit of fight from them</text>
  <text start="834.42" dur="4.289">about like no no this has been really</text>
  <text start="836.73" dur="4.649">great this has been wonderful you know</text>
  <text start="838.709" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ve done this we&amp;#39;ve done that and so I</text>
  <text start="841.379" dur="4.411">almost got to be feeling that I was</text>
  <text start="843.569" dur="3.721">talking to you know the generals who</text>
  <text start="845.79" dur="3.359">some of the generals who fought the</text>
  <text start="847.29" dur="3.599">Vietnam War and they could tell you</text>
  <text start="849.149" dur="3.42">about body cams they could talk about</text>
  <text start="850.889" dur="4.17">strategy they talk about all those</text>
  <text start="852.569" dur="4.291">things but that fundamental question of</text>
  <text start="855.059" dur="3.661">whether this would was a war that should</text>
  <text start="856.86" dur="5.039">be thought they couldn&amp;#39;t get an answer</text>
  <text start="858.72" dur="5.459">and that struck me as well gee if the</text>
  <text start="861.899" dur="4.62">chief guards of the vaccine work and you</text>
  <text start="864.179" dur="4.981">know a Stanford Law professor can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="866.519" dur="4.23">me that this is good but they can&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="869.16" dur="3.929">me it should be stopped you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="870.749" dur="4.26">really troubled it sounds almost like a</text>
  <text start="873.089" dur="3.391">yeah just following orders mentality and</text>
  <text start="875.009" dur="4.231">I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not saying that&amp;#39;s them</text>
  <text start="876.48" dur="4.589">necessarily but you know for those who</text>
  <text start="879.24" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t have any hope or think that this</text>
  <text start="881.069" dur="4.32">is beyond salvation or that we have no</text>
  <text start="883.11" dur="4.5">chance I want to also bring up the fact</text>
  <text start="885.389" dur="4.23">that at Monsanto and glyphosate are</text>
  <text start="887.61" dur="4.11">going through some major battles right</text>
  <text start="889.619" dur="3.84">now over what they&amp;#39;ve done a little bit</text>
  <text start="891.72" dur="4.289">different topic but still they were</text>
  <text start="893.459" dur="4.831">protected by the establishment you know</text>
  <text start="896.009" dur="4.471">big pharma kind of shielded glyphosate</text>
  <text start="898.29" dur="4.889">from any sort of real controversy or</text>
  <text start="900.48" dur="4.709">liability and now suddenly Monsanto&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="903.179" dur="3.361">being sued per person for hundreds of</text>
  <text start="905.189" dur="4.02">millions of dollars to thousands of</text>
  <text start="906.54" dur="5.25">suits for causing cancer so when it</text>
  <text start="909.209" dur="4.081">flips and the energy is there this could</text>
  <text start="911.79" dur="2.669">turn this could change we can get rid of</text>
  <text start="913.29" dur="2.459">vaccine court we could have rural</text>
  <text start="914.459" dur="4.35">justice we could see these companies</text>
  <text start="915.749" dur="4.5">bankrupted the way they should be and</text>
  <text start="918.809" dur="3.661">you know I think that&amp;#39;s a really great</text>
  <text start="920.249" dur="4.2">point and so one of the things that you</text>
  <text start="922.47" dur="7.229">know I kind of you know think about</text>
  <text start="924.449" dur="7.62">strategically is my job is to provoke</text>
  <text start="929.699" dur="5.61">the overreaction from the authorities</text>
  <text start="932.069" dur="5.321">and so you know I don&amp;#39;t know if you know</text>
  <text start="935.309" dur="6.791">the story about me getting banned from</text>
  <text start="937.39" dur="6.48">Julia I had I shared that story with you</text>
  <text start="942.1" dur="4.53">or have you heard about it no I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="943.87" dur="4.409">so go ahead please so so this was just</text>
  <text start="946.63" dur="3.959">kind of funny in it and you know it</text>
  <text start="948.279" dur="5.461">really made me think about like oh wow</text>
  <text start="950.589" dur="6.421">this is how we we do things we really</text>
  <text start="953.74" dur="6.9">provocative so when the first VAX movie</text>
  <text start="957.01" dur="7.04">came out Polly Tommy and the crew went</text>
  <text start="960.64" dur="5.819">to Australia to do a tour there and they</text>
  <text start="964.05" dur="6.039">got hustled by the government and</text>
  <text start="966.459" dur="6.361">hassled by the media and when they were</text>
  <text start="970.089" dur="5.701">getting ready to leave the country they</text>
  <text start="972.82" dur="5.42">were stopped at immigration immigration</text>
  <text start="975.79" dur="5.28">held them for a little under an hour</text>
  <text start="978.24" dur="5.8">took all of their documents photographed</text>
  <text start="981.07" dur="6.3">them and as they were getting ready to</text>
  <text start="984.04" dur="6.299">go the Asian said you know if we had</text>
  <text start="987.37" dur="5.64">known you were coming we would never let</text>
  <text start="990.339" dur="4.231">you into the country and so I had worked</text>
  <text start="993.01" dur="4.59">with Polly Tom because I had contributed</text>
  <text start="994.57" dur="4.769">articles to her magazine autism file and</text>
  <text start="997.6" dur="3.39">so I immediately called her up and I</text>
  <text start="999.339" dur="4.231">said oh my god I got to do an interview</text>
  <text start="1000.99" dur="6.75">with her because I write for the Boland</text>
  <text start="1003.57" dur="5.639">report and so so you know I did this</text>
  <text start="1007.74" dur="4.289">interview with her and she said you know</text>
  <text start="1009.209" dur="4.56">god it was it was so amazing because we</text>
  <text start="1012.029" dur="3.841">really hadn&amp;#39;t sold many tickets until</text>
  <text start="1013.769" dur="5.07">they attacked us and then after they</text>
  <text start="1015.87" dur="5.279">attacked us you know we saw it sold out</text>
  <text start="1018.839" dur="4.891">every venue and so you know I thought</text>
  <text start="1021.149" dur="4.8">okay this sounds kind of fun I have no</text>
  <text start="1023.73" dur="5.209">ability to go to Australia Destin all</text>
  <text start="1025.949" dur="7.711">right but but okay I&amp;#39;m going to apply</text>
  <text start="1028.939" dur="6.64">specifically for visa to Australia to do</text>
  <text start="1033.66" dur="4.35">a lecture tour which I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1035.579" dur="5.041">entitle the dangerous science to her and</text>
  <text start="1038.01" dur="6.21">then I wrote an open letter to the Prime</text>
  <text start="1040.62" dur="5.4">Minister Malcolm Turnbull and I said you</text>
  <text start="1044.22" dur="3.719">know dear Prime Minister I am planning</text>
  <text start="1046.02" dur="4.92">to visit your great country to talk</text>
  <text start="1047.939" dur="5.101">about how terrible vaccines are and you</text>
  <text start="1050.94" dur="4.05">know I think that it would be great if</text>
  <text start="1053.04" dur="4.53">you would pick me up at the airport and</text>
  <text start="1054.99" dur="4.14">so then I could be driven to your</text>
  <text start="1057.57" dur="3.93">residence and we could have private</text>
  <text start="1059.13" dur="5.7">talks about this and you know please</text>
  <text start="1061.5" dur="6.15">don&amp;#39;t make a big fuss over me but if you</text>
  <text start="1064.83" dur="5.07">want to give me an award for my work you</text>
  <text start="1067.65" dur="3.03">know considering my my you know world</text>
  <text start="1069.9" dur="2.79">important</text>

  <text start="1079.77" dur="5.82">think this was gonna go anywhere but you</text>
  <text start="1083.31" dur="5.37">know two or three days later I am in</text>
  <text start="1085.59" dur="4.62">newspapers all over the world saying you</text>

  <text start="1117.3" dur="5.82">well in this thing yeah you know and I</text>
  <text start="1120.48" dur="6.69">thought gee I spent 20 bucks you know to</text>
  <text start="1123.12" dur="8.52">troll them so you know I realize that we</text>
  <text start="1127.17" dur="8.04">have to engage in non-standard ways of</text>
  <text start="1131.64" dur="5.52">protest to do this because you know and</text>
  <text start="1135.21" dur="4.35">I think that this is something that you</text>
  <text start="1137.16" dur="4.89">know my fellow people in the movement</text>
  <text start="1139.56" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t quite understand is you know you</text>
  <text start="1142.05" dur="4.44">think gee kids are being hurt shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1144.6" dur="4.23">I just be able to say kids are being</text>
  <text start="1146.49" dur="4.65">hurt and and you know people will list</text>
  <text start="1148.83" dur="4.68">in it and apparently it&amp;#39;s not that so I</text>
  <text start="1151.14" dur="4.35">really tried to be as provocative as</text>
  <text start="1153.51" dur="4.35">possible you know it makes a lot of</text>
  <text start="1155.49" dur="5.04">sense I&amp;#39;ve had some similar experiences</text>
  <text start="1157.86" dur="4.5">myself and I won&amp;#39;t go to too much detail</text>
  <text start="1160.53" dur="3.78">but I&amp;#39;ve been attacked by the media and</text>
  <text start="1162.36" dur="4.32">some other figures in media and and it</text>
  <text start="1164.31" dur="4.56">always works to my favor because people</text>
  <text start="1166.68" dur="3.78">they look into it they see the the drama</text>
  <text start="1168.87" dur="3.93">I guess and then they look into it they</text>
  <text start="1170.46" dur="4.29">see the detail in the context and I just</text>
  <text start="1172.8" dur="3.81">get stronger each time and a lot of</text>

  <text start="1204.299" dur="7.88">on dr. judy my kibbutz is a 20-year</text>
  <text start="1208.469" dur="7.05">government scientist and in 2009 she</text>
  <text start="1212.179" dur="6.88">published an article in the journal</text>
  <text start="1215.519" dur="5.52">science which is the top journal for</text>
  <text start="1219.059" dur="6.3">original science and and what she found</text>
  <text start="1221.039" dur="7.531">is that women with and men with chronic</text>
  <text start="1225.359" dur="6.6">fatigue syndrome seemed to be have this</text>
  <text start="1228.57" dur="6.359">virus called XMRV which is a mass</text>
  <text start="1231.959" dur="6.06">retrovirus which has somehow transferred</text>
  <text start="1234.929" dur="5.011">to the human population and what was</text>
  <text start="1238.019" dur="4.53">really interesting is she as a</text>
  <text start="1239.94" dur="4.789">background as an HIV researcher and in</text>
  <text start="1242.549" dur="6.901">fact she was part of the team that</text>
  <text start="1244.729" dur="7.81">figured out that with these anti AIDS</text>
  <text start="1249.45" dur="6.299">medications what you needed to do was</text>
  <text start="1252.539" dur="6.151">not give them as the last resort but</text>
  <text start="1255.749" dur="5.22">give them when somebody has recently</text>
  <text start="1258.69" dur="4.409">diagnosed so that the immune system can</text>
  <text start="1260.969" dur="4.77">actually get to work suppressing the</text>
  <text start="1263.099" dur="4.17">virus while retrovirus is a little bit</text>
  <text start="1265.739" dur="4.59">different than regular virus because</text>
  <text start="1267.269" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s made of RNA rather than DNA and</text>
  <text start="1270.329" dur="4.98">then it requires as a nun called reverse</text>
  <text start="1272.789" dur="5.7">transcriptase in order to translate into</text>
  <text start="1275.309" dur="5.16">DNA well reverse transcriptase is kind</text>
  <text start="1278.489" dur="4.77">of a crappy enzyme it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1280.469" dur="5.79">work that well so you know one of the</text>
  <text start="1283.259" dur="5.1">retroviruses are you know not functional</text>
  <text start="1286.259" dur="4.11">and everything but it can affect the</text>
  <text start="1288.359" dur="3.961">immune system and so what was</text>
  <text start="1290.369" dur="4.35">interesting for her is she got in</text>
  <text start="1292.32" dur="6.049">trouble and I became interested in her</text>
  <text start="1294.719" dur="5.88">when she had made the observation that</text>
  <text start="1298.369" dur="5.77">many of these women with chronic fatigue</text>
  <text start="1300.599" dur="6.63">syndrome had kids with autism and so she</text>
  <text start="1304.139" dur="5.34">went back to her HIV experience and she</text>
  <text start="1307.229" dur="6.841">says she realized that the standard of</text>
  <text start="1309.479" dur="6.57">care for HIV infected mothers is their</text>
  <text start="1314.07" dur="5.039">children when they&amp;#39;re born will</text>
  <text start="1316.049" dur="6.78">immediately go on antiretrovirals prior</text>
  <text start="1319.109" dur="6.18">to getting any vaccinations because the</text>
  <text start="1322.829" dur="4.8">virus likes to hide out and be in T</text>
  <text start="1325.289" dur="4.32">cells of the immune system which are</text>
  <text start="1327.629" dur="5.311">exactly the cells that are stimulated by</text>
  <text start="1329.609" dur="6">a vaccine and so suddenly she was giving</text>
  <text start="1332.94" dur="5.229">a really good scientific explanation for</text>
  <text start="1335.609" dur="4.81">this observation of Perun</text>
  <text start="1338.169" dur="5.34">said hey my kid was fine before the</text>
  <text start="1340.419" dur="5.22">vaccine they were not fine after it</text>
  <text start="1343.509" dur="4.05">well she&amp;#39;s viciously attacked I got to</text>
  <text start="1345.639" dur="3.9">know her you know relatively quickly</text>
  <text start="1347.559" dur="4.791">after that do you think Rayanne well</text>
  <text start="1349.539" dur="5.73">what I love about dr. micha Venice is</text>
  <text start="1352.35" dur="5.259">she is relentless searching for the</text>
  <text start="1355.269" dur="5.4">truth so you know I had said to her</text>
  <text start="1357.609" dur="4.111">relatively early on you know gee I think</text>
  <text start="1360.669" dur="3.541">you&amp;#39;re gonna get into a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="1361.72" dur="4.919">oh no you know look I just stick to the</text>
  <text start="1364.21" dur="6.049">science and you know by the way we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1366.639" dur="6.571">got Senator Harry Reid is one of our big</text>
  <text start="1370.259" dur="4.691">backers and you know everything&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="1373.21" dur="4.14">go fine I&amp;#39;m going to keep my nose clean</text>
  <text start="1374.95" dur="4.409">you know I&amp;#39;ll say the truth but hey you</text>
  <text start="1377.35" dur="4.829">know I&amp;#39;m making sure my science is well</text>
  <text start="1379.359" dur="5.581">backed up and you know of course she was</text>
  <text start="1382.179" dur="5.07">and and but the other thing that I</text>
  <text start="1384.94" dur="4.02">really love about dr. micha vets is and</text>
  <text start="1387.249" dur="3.841">I think this is something that any</text>
  <text start="1388.96" dur="4.62">scientists are in need human beings</text>
  <text start="1391.09" dur="5.219">should have is this curiosity about</text>
  <text start="1393.58" dur="4.74">what&amp;#39;s going on so I mean I had said to</text>
  <text start="1396.309" dur="4.651">her well gee you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1398.32" dur="6">saying that this you know retrovirus</text>
  <text start="1400.96" dur="5.52">went from mice to humans well mice and</text>
  <text start="1404.32" dur="3.599">humans have shared the planet for</text>
  <text start="1406.48" dur="3.569">millions of years but there seems to be</text>
  <text start="1407.919" dur="3.901">a relatively recent occurrence you know</text>
  <text start="1410.049" dur="3.24">do you have any understanding of how</text>
  <text start="1411.82" dur="3.15">this might have happened and she said no</text>
  <text start="1413.289" dur="5.13">and so I went and I did some research</text>
  <text start="1414.97" dur="5.189">and what I uncovered was that the first</text>
  <text start="1418.419" dur="3.23">and this is something that kind of</text>
  <text start="1420.159" dur="4.561">everybody in chronic fatigue syndrome</text>
  <text start="1421.649" dur="6.16">groupies on the first outbreak of</text>
  <text start="1424.72" dur="5.88">chronic fatigue syndrome was in 1934</text>
  <text start="1427.809" dur="5.7">1935 among a hundred ninety-eight</text>
  <text start="1430.6" dur="6.509">doctors and nurses at Los Angeles County</text>
  <text start="1433.509" dur="6.841">Hospital who received an early polio</text>
  <text start="1437.109" dur="5.91">vaccine yeah well what else I find out I</text>
  <text start="1440.35" dur="6">looked into that polio vaccine it was</text>
  <text start="1443.019" dur="5.311">put together by name a guy named Maurice</text>
  <text start="1446.35" dur="4.529">Brody who was also involved with the</text>
  <text start="1448.33" dur="4.65">Rockefeller Institute and it was one of</text>
  <text start="1450.879" dur="5.76">the first vaccines that was grown in</text>
  <text start="1452.98" dur="6.6">mouse brain tissue and so in addition to</text>
  <text start="1456.639" dur="6.36">the mouse brain tissue that this virus</text>
  <text start="1459.58" dur="6.12">was grown in they gave an accompanying</text>
  <text start="1462.999" dur="5.581">dose of like an immune system booster</text>
  <text start="1465.7" dur="3.48">which was preserved with thimerosal a</text>
  <text start="1468.58" dur="3.36">mercury</text>
  <text start="1469.18" dur="4.5">derivatives so you know here I am you</text>
  <text start="1471.94" dur="3.54">know in my background as an attorney I</text>
  <text start="1473.68" dur="4.17">tried to find out how did things happen</text>
  <text start="1475.48" dur="4.95">where was the first instance of it so</text>
  <text start="1477.85" dur="6.54">you know at the scene of crime</text>
  <text start="1480.43" dur="7.53">I find this mouse tissue being used in</text>
  <text start="1484.39" dur="5.61">vaccines and I also find that Marysol so</text>
  <text start="1487.96" dur="5.85">to me it was pretty clear that this is</text>
  <text start="1490" dur="6.26">what was going on in it in 2011 in the</text>
  <text start="1493.81" dur="5.13">Journal called trenders and microbiology</text>
  <text start="1496.26" dur="5.38">somebody published this exact sort of</text>
  <text start="1498.94" dur="4.8">you know explanation saying like well</text>
  <text start="1501.64" dur="3.99">gee how did this virus get transferred</text>
  <text start="1503.74" dur="4.74">to human beings well we used mouse</text>
  <text start="1505.63" dur="4.95">tissue and you know it&amp;#39;s in early</text>
  <text start="1508.48" dur="5.07">vaccine and so that really makes a lot</text>
  <text start="1510.58" dur="5.22">of sense and what was really interesting</text>
  <text start="1513.55" dur="4.8">was I you know I always like to be a big</text>
  <text start="1515.8" dur="4.92">thinker so I&amp;#39;m saying like okay well we</text>
  <text start="1518.35" dur="5.07">had this with mice now let&amp;#39;s ask the</text>
  <text start="1520.72" dur="6.78">bigger question is it ever a good idea</text>
  <text start="1523.42" dur="8.1">to use animal tissue to grow viruses and</text>
  <text start="1527.5" dur="6.15">then re-inject those vaccines into human</text>
  <text start="1531.52" dur="3.42">beings because you know I&amp;#39;ve got a lot</text>
  <text start="1533.65" dur="2.82">of friends who are vegetarians and</text>
  <text start="1534.94" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;ll come we&amp;#39;ve got like the the</text>
  <text start="1536.47" dur="2.88">negative health effects of eating</text>
  <text start="1537.85" dur="5.13">animals and you know I understand that</text>
  <text start="1539.35" dur="6.51">but it&amp;#39;s a whole nother level to say</text>
  <text start="1542.98" dur="4.8">okay you know at least when we eat</text>
  <text start="1545.86" dur="4.2">animals our stomach acids are breaking</text>
  <text start="1547.78" dur="4.17">down in anything that&amp;#39;s there but when</text>
  <text start="1550.06" dur="5.43">you&amp;#39;re crossing that blood barrier</text>
  <text start="1551.95" dur="7.77">you&amp;#39;re injecting animal tissue directly</text>
  <text start="1555.49" dur="6.03">into the bloodstream of people and you</text>
  <text start="1559.72" dur="3.48">know if you go back in history the</text>
  <text start="1561.52" dur="4.44">greatest plagues have been when you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1563.2" dur="5.25">had this combination of unhealthy</text>
  <text start="1565.96" dur="4.5">conditions usually in cities you know</text>
  <text start="1568.45" dur="4.2">and you know people might there might be</text>
  <text start="1570.46" dur="3.66">you know something of a famine so people</text>
  <text start="1572.65" dur="3.87">are crowding together in the cities and</text>
  <text start="1574.12" dur="5.28">then you know these viruses from the</text>
  <text start="1576.52" dur="6.18">animals so it seems like oh my god we</text>
  <text start="1579.4" dur="5.55">understand we need hygiene but in doing</text>
  <text start="1582.7" dur="3.75">something that&amp;#39;s even worse I want to</text>
  <text start="1584.95" dur="3.66">add to that it&amp;#39;s happening again in</text>
  <text start="1586.45" dur="4.23">California right now with the homeless</text>
  <text start="1588.61" dur="4.2">populations the rats and the typhus</text>
  <text start="1590.68" dur="4.29">outbreaks and even though vaccinated</text>
  <text start="1592.81" dur="3.57">population largely although you know</text>
  <text start="1594.97" dur="3.39">maybe some of the illegals aren&amp;#39;t but</text>
  <text start="1596.38" dur="3.75">more or less it&amp;#39;s largely vaccinated</text>
  <text start="1598.36" dur="4.03">population and you&amp;#39;re getting outbreaks</text>
  <text start="1600.13" dur="3.4">again because it&amp;#39;s not the vaccines</text>
  <text start="1602.39" dur="2.55">as you were pointing out with like the</text>
  <text start="1603.53" dur="4.08">polio and these other things when the</text>
  <text start="1604.94" dur="4.8">early early when they first introduced</text>
  <text start="1607.61" dur="4.44">them early on that all of the disease</text>
  <text start="1609.74" dur="4.2">metrics were going down then it bumped</text>
  <text start="1612.05" dur="4.32">right back up because of the actual</text>
  <text start="1613.94" dur="4.29">vaccine itself many states banned the</text>
  <text start="1616.37" dur="4.11">polio vaccine for killing people and</text>
  <text start="1618.23" dur="4.32">paralyzing people and then it continued</text>
  <text start="1620.48" dur="4.32">its downward trend so can we can we</text>
  <text start="1622.55" dur="4.65">benefit ourselves by breeding disease on</text>
  <text start="1624.8" dur="5.88">animal tissue including dead baby tissue</text>
  <text start="1627.2" dur="5.67">in some cases and yeah and so it was</text>
  <text start="1630.68" dur="5.04">kind of like if if there&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="1632.87" dur="4.44">contribution to this discussion it was</text>
  <text start="1635.72" dur="3.6">really to ask the you know to first of</text>
  <text start="1637.31" dur="4.35">all to find out gee at that first</text>
  <text start="1639.32" dur="3.93">outbreak we had mouse tissue and that</text>
  <text start="1641.66" dur="5.85">mercury which is something that people</text>
  <text start="1643.25" dur="7.17">are concerned about and then to ask this</text>
  <text start="1647.51" dur="3.66">broader question of gee is this a really</text>
  <text start="1650.42" dur="4.05">bad idea</text>
  <text start="1651.17" dur="5.63">to use any animal tissue which you then</text>
  <text start="1654.47" dur="6.51">put it back into human beings because</text>
  <text start="1656.8" dur="6.19">what&amp;#39;s happening is you know about 8% of</text>
  <text start="1660.98" dur="5.1">our genetic code is basically silenced</text>
  <text start="1662.99" dur="6.33">viruses okay but if the immune system</text>
  <text start="1666.08" dur="4.49">starts to falter for some reason or it</text>
  <text start="1669.32" dur="4.65">gets certain challenges that those</text>
  <text start="1670.57" dur="6.16">viruses can rise back up so you know we</text>
  <text start="1673.97" dur="4.8">got a lot of controversy because you</text>
  <text start="1676.73" dur="5.58">know we were saying gee I we think this</text>
  <text start="1678.77" dur="5.1">mouse retrovirus is causing probably you</text>
  <text start="1682.31" dur="3.87">know chronic fatigue syndrome autism</text>
  <text start="1683.87" dur="4.05">also prostate cancer in men is what is</text>
  <text start="1686.18" dur="5.1">what seems to happen in men because they</text>
  <text start="1687.92" dur="6.23">find this in prostate cancer tissue and</text>
  <text start="1691.28" dur="5.82">people were talking about endogenous</text>
  <text start="1694.15" dur="4.36">retroviruses and you know the fact is</text>
  <text start="1697.1" dur="4.05">you know we&amp;#39;re not really saying that</text>
  <text start="1698.51" dur="5.67">much different because if you unbalance</text>
  <text start="1701.15" dur="5.4">the immune system other viruses can rise</text>
  <text start="1704.18" dur="4.38">up as well so and these viruses are</text>
  <text start="1706.55" dur="4.32">really promiscuous and that they like to</text>
  <text start="1708.56" dur="4.47">recombine so you know you get something</text>
  <text start="1710.87" dur="4.38">that really looks like a Frankenstein</text>
  <text start="1713.03" dur="4.05">but you know going back to what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1715.25" dur="3.87">done with unbalanced the immune system</text>
  <text start="1717.08" dur="3.42">and you know you mentioned fetal tissue</text>
  <text start="1719.12" dur="5.67">and I really want to talk to that</text>
  <text start="1720.5" dur="6.48">because one of my daughter&amp;#39;s doctors was</text>
  <text start="1724.79" dur="4.73">dr. Jeff Bradstreet who you know died</text>
  <text start="1726.98" dur="5.76">under very mysterious circumstances and</text>
  <text start="1729.52" dur="4.63">I&amp;#39;ve interviewed his family and one of</text>
  <text start="1732.74" dur="3.33">the things that they told me it shortly</text>
  <text start="1734.15" dur="4.26">before he died under those</text>
  <text start="1736.07" dur="5.1">serious circumstances he was looking at</text>
  <text start="1738.41" dur="5.01">this question of aborted human fetal</text>
  <text start="1741.17" dur="5.01">tissue and it was really bothering him</text>
  <text start="1743.42" dur="5.07">because what he was doing is he was</text>
  <text start="1746.18" dur="4.38">taking doing genetic testing on the</text>
  <text start="1748.49" dur="3.96">children and then doing genetic testing</text>
  <text start="1750.56" dur="4.59">on the mother and the father and he</text>
  <text start="1752.45" dur="5.64">thought that the genetic testing was</text>
  <text start="1755.15" dur="4.56">mistaken because he was finding in the</text>
  <text start="1758.09" dur="5.07">children that they had genetic material</text>
  <text start="1759.71" dur="7.02">from mom dad and some third entity and</text>
  <text start="1763.16" dur="5.25">so what he came to believe surely before</text>
  <text start="1766.73" dur="5.1">he died</text>
  <text start="1768.41" dur="7.86">one is that the human a human fetal</text>
  <text start="1771.83" dur="7.23">tissue under conditions of retroviruses</text>
  <text start="1776.27" dur="5.31">because that the reverse transcriptase</text>
  <text start="1779.06" dur="4.77">will tend to open up the genetic code he</text>

  <text start="1843.38" dur="4.89">like to de-escalate that and say I think</text>
  <text start="1845.93" dur="5.16">this is this the scientific problem and</text>
  <text start="1848.27" dur="4.71">I think I can just talk a little bit</text>
  <text start="1851.09" dur="4.13">about one of the things that we</text>
  <text start="1852.98" dur="7.08">investigate and plague of corruption is</text>
  <text start="1855.22" dur="7.78">the question of HIV and AIDS because</text>
  <text start="1860.06" dur="6.09">here judy has worked on it and you know</text>

  <text start="1866.15" dur="5.8">you know what she was told at the time</text>
  <text start="1869.22" dur="5.579">as to the question of where did HIV D</text>
  <text start="1871.95" dur="5.33">come from well we actually have a pretty</text>
  <text start="1874.799" dur="5.61">clear answer it seems that it came from</text>
  <text start="1877.28" dur="4.99">chimpanzees it also was in other types</text>
  <text start="1880.409" dur="5.101">of monkeys but it seems predominantly</text>
  <text start="1882.27" dur="7.11">chimpanzees so what was the official</text>
  <text start="1885.51" dur="6.06">story of how HIV made this jump well the</text>
  <text start="1889.38" dur="4.11">official story and you can find it in</text>
  <text start="1891.57" dur="4.859">books like the chimp and the river and</text>
  <text start="1893.49" dur="5.429">David kawaman has written about this and</text>

  <text start="1902.789" dur="5.851">was hunting chimpanzees you know he got</text>
  <text start="1906.33" dur="3.78">cut and it came in and you know maybe</text>
  <text start="1908.64" dur="3.39">there was also the fact that they were</text>

  <text start="1922.47" dur="5.04">his other theory which I find much more</text>
  <text start="1925.23" dur="4.53">credible popularized by a guy named</text>
  <text start="1927.51" dur="5.19">Edward Hopper in his book the river and</text>
  <text start="1929.76" dur="6.63">what he says is that in the early 90s</text>

  <text start="2043.02" dur="5.879">what&amp;#39;s coming the cause of the vaccines</text>
  <text start="2044.88" dur="6.299">and he talked about a virgin soil</text>

  <text start="2051.179" dur="3.72">some of these these genetic viruses are</text>
  <text start="2053.28" dur="4.32">now mutating because of the vaccines</text>
  <text start="2054.899" dur="4.921">yeah them have changed form into</text>
  <text start="2057.6" dur="4.319">something worse something we have no</text>
  <text start="2059.82" dur="5.16">immunity for and it&amp;#39;s gonna hit us like</text>
  <text start="2061.919" dur="5.22">a virgin soil moment and and I use the</text>
  <text start="2064.98" dur="4.409">example sometimes of you know when white</text>
  <text start="2067.139" dur="4.591">feet white people first met Africa they</text>
  <text start="2069.389" dur="4.201">died a lot right yeah all the diseases</text>
  <text start="2071.73" dur="4.05">when when white people first came to</text>

  <text start="2098.31" dur="3.69">we could be in theory looking at a bad</text>

  <text start="2102" dur="5.43">at least possibly if we&amp;#39;re going by sick</text>
  <text start="2105.21" dur="4.38">care advice from Big Pharma I mean I</text>
  <text start="2107.43" dur="4.05">personally think that the risk is over</text>

  <text start="2117.24" dur="4.23">a lot of people stuck on this false</text>
  <text start="2118.95" dur="5.28">faith based system I would say at this</text>
  <text start="2121.47" dur="4.56">point and in the pseudoscience of</text>
  <text start="2124.23" dur="3.9">vaccines and Big Pharma and which are</text>
  <text start="2126.03" dur="5.04">all industry controlled and and clearly</text>
  <text start="2128.13" dur="5.85">biased and always or often</text>

  <text start="2133.98" dur="5.28">may be they&amp;#39;re gonna suffer in great</text>

  <text start="2141.24" dur="3.23">doctor not getting their own information</text>
  <text start="2142.95" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re not doing their own research</text>
  <text start="2144.47" dur="4.87">yeah and one of the things that we spend</text>
  <text start="2147.75" dur="4.11">a lot of time in the book talking about</text>
  <text start="2149.34" dur="5.94">is you know what might the future look</text>
  <text start="2151.86" dur="6.63">like if we you know stop with the lies</text>
  <text start="2155.28" dur="4.59">if we search for the truth because the</text>
  <text start="2158.49" dur="4.53">and I think one of the things that</text>
  <text start="2159.87" dur="6.51">really disturbs dr. micha bit so much is</text>
  <text start="2163.02" dur="6.18">you know she remembers actually you know</text>
  <text start="2166.38" dur="5.22">walking through protesters you know with</text>
  <text start="2169.2" dur="5.97">act up signs you know these you know</text>
  <text start="2171.6" dur="5.85">beautiful young men were dying and she</text>
  <text start="2175.17" dur="5.31">said you know we solved that problem you</text>
  <text start="2177.45" dur="5">know we we came up with solutions and I</text>
  <text start="2180.48" dur="4.53">think what frustrates her the most is</text>
  <text start="2182.45" dur="6.46">there&amp;#39;s this entire body of research</text>
  <text start="2185.01" dur="5.7">about how to deal with hiv/aids and you</text>
  <text start="2188.91" dur="3.75">know now we&amp;#39;ve got the president even</text>
  <text start="2190.71" dur="3.84">talking about you know 10 years we might</text>
  <text start="2192.66" dur="4.2">be able to do some things to you know</text>
  <text start="2194.55" dur="4.71">completely eradicate it you know there</text>
  <text start="2196.86" dur="6.27">are strategies and you know there are</text>
  <text start="2199.26" dur="5.55">potential therapies that might be</text>
  <text start="2203.13" dur="4.35">dramatic like one of the things that I</text>
  <text start="2204.81" dur="4.62">think is really interesting is I talk</text>
  <text start="2207.48" dur="4.56">about the work of dr. James Adams at</text>
  <text start="2209.43" dur="5.4">Arizona State University and so what his</text>
  <text start="2212.04" dur="5.61">idea is you know he we have begun to</text>
  <text start="2214.83" dur="6.39">understand how diverse the microbiome is</text>
  <text start="2217.65" dur="6">and how impacted you know beast kids</text>
  <text start="2221.22" dur="5.55">with autism re I mean and so we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2223.65" dur="5.67">even understand you know what is is in</text>
  <text start="2226.77" dur="4.49">their system and what all those bacteria</text>
  <text start="2229.32" dur="5.19">are doing is so you know he&amp;#39;s been doing</text>
  <text start="2231.26" dur="5.05">fecal microbiota transplants you know</text>
  <text start="2234.51" dur="4.05">the the results are just you know</text>
  <text start="2236.31" dur="4.53">nothing short of remarkable in terms of</text>
  <text start="2238.56" dur="4.68">you know a majority of the kids after</text>
  <text start="2240.84" dur="3.75">two years or a significant number</text>
  <text start="2243.24" dur="4.2">you know they lose their autism</text>
  <text start="2244.59" dur="5.22">diagnosis and you know we can look look</text>
  <text start="2247.44" dur="6.51">what I always say is something is wrong</text>
  <text start="2249.81" dur="6.93">in the body of these kids and maybe if</text>
  <text start="2253.95" dur="4.89">we can start fixing those problems then</text>
  <text start="2256.74" dur="4.23">you know that like let&amp;#39;s start with the</text>
  <text start="2258.84" dur="4.719">fecal microbiota transplant let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="2260.97" dur="6.039">the gut working well okay maybe</text>
  <text start="2263.559" dur="6.03">like H baht might help then something</text>

  <text start="2271.059" dur="4.29">years doesn&amp;#39;t seem to do too much but</text>
  <text start="2272.68" dur="4.799">well maybe the gut isn&amp;#39;t fixed maybe if</text>
  <text start="2275.349" dur="4.17">that is fixed things that I&amp;#39;ve tried in</text>
  <text start="2277.479" dur="5.28">the past that failed will work better</text>
  <text start="2279.519" dur="6.151">and but you know it&amp;#39;s dependent upon us</text>
  <text start="2282.759" dur="5.34">telling the truth and so that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="2285.67" dur="3.569">kind of like fight so hard because you</text>
  <text start="2288.099" dur="5.071">know write these books write these</text>

  <text start="2387.729" dur="4.71">I liked whenever we mentioned probiotics</text>
  <text start="2390.039" dur="4.44">I like to mention kefir because people</text>
  <text start="2392.439" dur="3.3">can make it at home and right portable</text>
  <text start="2394.479" dur="2.911">for them and you could you can make it</text>
  <text start="2395.739" dur="2.971">in water or in milk</text>
  <text start="2397.39" dur="3.48">very neat stuff for people but there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2398.71" dur="4.8">ton of great information options out</text>
  <text start="2400.87" dur="4.74">there for folks anyway I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="2403.51" dur="3.39">add that in there and you know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2405.61" dur="3.96">talked about all these different topics</text>
  <text start="2406.9" dur="4.68">now you know where do you see this going</text>
  <text start="2409.57" dur="4.74">in the future you for example your</text>
  <text start="2411.58" dur="4.95">fantasy there of Trump appointing you</text>
  <text start="2414.31" dur="3.93">know Robert Kennedy on this that would</text>
  <text start="2416.53" dur="3.48">be if a dream come true but I think</text>
  <text start="2418.24" dur="2.88">that&amp;#39;s gonna happen I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2420.01" dur="3.09">actually gonna happen within the next</text>
  <text start="2421.12" dur="3.45">year or two because you know Trump is</text>
  <text start="2423.1" dur="3.48">making a lot of moves that big pharma</text>
  <text start="2424.57" dur="3.54">hate like lowering drug prices and stuff</text>
  <text start="2426.58" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;s a fighter he&amp;#39;ll stand up to them</text>
  <text start="2428.11" dur="4.53">yeah and you know one of the things that</text>
  <text start="2430.36" dur="4.17">I like about Trump is I think he&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="2432.64" dur="3.42">strategic that her and I I just look at</text>
  <text start="2434.53" dur="4.02">what he&amp;#39;s been doing with China and and</text>
  <text start="2436.06" dur="4.47">you know some people will say like oh</text>
  <text start="2438.55" dur="4.58">gee you know but he&amp;#39;s friends with these</text>
  <text start="2440.53" dur="5.13">dictators well he he&amp;#39;s dig deep</text>
  <text start="2443.13" dur="5.47">personalizing it and then he&amp;#39;s going at</text>
  <text start="2445.66" dur="5.49">them as as hard as again I I I like one</text>
  <text start="2448.6" dur="5.19">commentator saying do you think that if</text>
  <text start="2451.15" dur="4.44">Trump seems to be your friend that</text>
  <text start="2453.79" dur="4.86">doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;ll also try to screw you</text>
  <text start="2455.59" dur="5.28">over if it&amp;#39;s in it better I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2458.65" dur="5.03">kind of true and you know I have sort of</text>
  <text start="2460.87" dur="5.76">a a little bit of a background because</text>
  <text start="2463.68" dur="5.71">one of our very close family friends</text>
  <text start="2466.63" dur="4.98">when I was growing up was somebody who</text>
  <text start="2469.39" dur="3.96">is very much like a Trump figure and and</text>
  <text start="2471.61" dur="3.27">actually it&amp;#39;s my parents who died this</text>
  <text start="2473.35" dur="3.99">person would have taken care of me and</text>
  <text start="2474.88" dur="4.86">you know we always talked about like</text>
  <text start="2477.34" dur="5.04">okay it&amp;#39;s great to be part of this guy</text>
  <text start="2479.74" dur="4.86">guys for his name was Angela you know</text>
  <text start="2482.38" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s great to be part of Angela&amp;#39;s family</text>
  <text start="2484.6" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t ever go into business with them</text>
  <text start="2487" dur="4.83">guys don&amp;#39;t figure out how to screw you</text>
  <text start="2488.92" dur="5.82">over and so you know very warm and yet</text>
  <text start="2491.83" dur="4.32">oh my god you know you know if you do a</text>
  <text start="2494.74" dur="4.11">deal with them you&amp;#39;re gonna walk away</text>
  <text start="2496.15" dur="6.6">with an empty wallet and so I think that</text>
  <text start="2498.85" dur="7.17">Trump is strategically doing things to</text>
  <text start="2502.75" dur="6.57">weaken Pharma for example just recently</text>
  <text start="2506.02" dur="4.83">I heard about his plan to have all of</text>
  <text start="2509.32" dur="4.14">the hospitals</text>
  <text start="2510.85" dur="4.32">you know publicize the prices and in</text>
  <text start="2513.46" dur="4.17">love have transparency and pricing just</text>
  <text start="2515.17" dur="5.07">like oh my god if you want a weaken them</text>
  <text start="2517.63" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s a great way to do it</text>
  <text start="2520.24" dur="6.09">yeah now I think another thing that he</text>
  <text start="2522.73" dur="5.73">could do is get rid of farm school</text>
  <text start="2526.33" dur="3.989">advertising on television</text>
  <text start="2528.46" dur="3.629">we&amp;#39;re the only country who sides New</text>
  <text start="2530.319" dur="4.891">Zealand that does that so I think</text>
  <text start="2532.089" dur="6.21">there&amp;#39;s a an international precedent not</text>
  <text start="2535.21" dur="5.19">to have that and and I think that you</text>
  <text start="2538.299" dur="4.05">know it would be a great attack also on</text>
  <text start="2540.4" dur="3.87">the mainstream media because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2542.349" dur="5.371">getting so many dollars from pharma so</text>
  <text start="2544.27" dur="5.73">you know I I am I&amp;#39;m encouraged by</text>
  <text start="2547.72" dur="5.399">Trump&amp;#39;s instincts I&amp;#39;m encouraged by some</text>
  <text start="2550" dur="5.309">of the things that he&amp;#39;s done I actually</text>
  <text start="2553.119" dur="3.93">think he could go farther but you know I</text>
  <text start="2555.309" dur="4.441">I feel a little bit like I&amp;#39;m Frederick</text>
  <text start="2557.049" dur="6.32">Douglas you know during Lincoln&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="2559.75" dur="6.93">and you know before Lincoln passed the</text>
  <text start="2563.369" dur="5.561">Emancipation Proclamation Frederick</text>
  <text start="2566.68" dur="5.31">Douglass was on him like you know a fly</text>
  <text start="2568.93" dur="6.03">on you-know-what but afterwards he was</text>
  <text start="2571.99" dur="6.9">like wow that was really good so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2574.96" dur="7.5">gonna keep pushing but if there&amp;#39;s any</text>
  <text start="2578.89" dur="6.449">person in public life who might attack</text>
  <text start="2582.46" dur="5.46">Big Pharma it would be Trung yeah</text>
  <text start="2585.339" dur="3.69">and I&amp;#39;ll add to that I think it was a</text>
  <text start="2587.92" dur="2.669">quote I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact quote</text>
  <text start="2589.029" dur="3.361">from Andy Wakefield that went around</text>
  <text start="2590.589" dur="3.99">talking about how he had spoken to Trump</text>
  <text start="2592.39" dur="3.659">privately when he was invited I guess to</text>
  <text start="2594.579" dur="3.27">the White House and and they had had a</text>
  <text start="2596.049" dur="3.75">conversation he came away thinking that</text>
  <text start="2597.849" dur="4.531">that Trump knows what&amp;#39;s going on and</text>
  <text start="2599.799" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s moving toward that you know</text>
  <text start="2602.38" dur="3.449">for whichever side of the political</text>
  <text start="2603.549" dur="5.01">debate or I&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;re on love him or</text>
  <text start="2605.829" dur="5.191">hate him either way his power to do</text>
  <text start="2608.559" dur="4.02">things was very limited at first yeah</text>
  <text start="2611.02" dur="2.97">Allen&amp;#39;s have pointed over like a hundred</text>
  <text start="2612.579" dur="3.51">and fifty judges you know we have the</text>
  <text start="2613.99" dur="3.71">Supreme Court all of these are like</text>
  <text start="2616.089" dur="4.44">constitutional rule of law and judges</text>
  <text start="2617.7" dur="4.54">presumably so that we&amp;#39;re getting into</text>
  <text start="2620.529" dur="3.3">that position now where like justice</text>
  <text start="2622.24" dur="3.93">could happen whereas before it was just</text>
  <text start="2623.829" dur="4.02">impossible so I do believe that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2626.17" dur="3.51">looking at that the future I do believe</text>
  <text start="2627.849" dur="3.93">you know they&amp;#39;re the reason that a lot</text>
  <text start="2629.68" dur="3.99">of people are coming out against him</text>
  <text start="2631.779" dur="3.81">maybe is not because of something he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2633.67" dur="3.54">done or or his tweeting or his</text>
  <text start="2635.589" dur="4.081">mannerisms you know love him or hate him</text>
  <text start="2637.21" dur="3.93">but the cause of some of the people that</text>
  <text start="2639.67" dur="3.24">he threatens some of the power</text>
  <text start="2641.14" dur="3.449">establishment that he threatens to drain</text>
  <text start="2642.91" dur="5.159">that swamp so to speak that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2644.589" dur="5.311">affect Big Pharma - yeah so I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="2648.069" dur="3.99">impatient for something to happen but if</text>
  <text start="2649.9" dur="5.28">you give them a choice between moving</text>
  <text start="2652.059" dur="4.651">too early and lose in or waiting till</text>
  <text start="2655.18" dur="4.05">you know you&amp;#39;re gonna win I want to wait</text>
  <text start="2656.71" dur="4.57">I want to win sure yeah and that makes</text>
  <text start="2659.23" dur="3.79">absolute sense can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2661.28" dur="3.12">have we covered everything I know that</text>
  <text start="2663.02" dur="4.349">there&amp;#39;s this is a very complicated topic</text>
  <text start="2664.4" dur="5.1">first of all yeah there&amp;#39;s a million hurt</text>
  <text start="2667.369" dur="4.291">babies out there that will never get to</text>
  <text start="2669.5" dur="4.2">experience their normal life there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2671.66" dur="4.29">million or two million I guess about</text>
  <text start="2673.7" dur="3.57">rate parents out there who are trying to</text>
  <text start="2675.95" dur="3.27">fight so that this doesn&amp;#39;t happen to</text>
  <text start="2677.27" dur="3.3">other children and there&amp;#39;s some of them</text>
  <text start="2679.22" dur="3.99">that might even have hope for their own</text>
  <text start="2680.57" dur="4.14">children like it getting swept in this</text>
  <text start="2683.21" dur="3.42">stuff please you know give us your</text>
  <text start="2684.71" dur="3.57">thoughts and then kind of show you know</text>
  <text start="2686.63" dur="4.83">any optimism or hope that you think you</text>
  <text start="2688.28" dur="7.319">have so on that I&amp;#39;m a perpetual optimist</text>
  <text start="2691.46" dur="7.38">okay so I the the reason I fight is I</text>
  <text start="2695.599" dur="6.841">don&amp;#39;t believe that my daughter is going</text>
  <text start="2698.84" dur="6.54">to live the life that right now is her</text>
  <text start="2702.44" dur="6.51">trajectory we her trajectory is not good</text>
  <text start="2705.38" dur="6.75">I think that if we tell the truth as</text>
  <text start="2708.95" dur="6.6">long as there is life there is hope and</text>
  <text start="2712.13" dur="6.18">so I&amp;#39;m fighting for every single one of</text>
  <text start="2715.55" dur="4.23">these kids you know in reading about HIV</text>
  <text start="2718.31" dur="3.51">and AIDS you know it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2719.78" dur="4.2">interesting to read these stories of</text>
  <text start="2721.82" dur="5.07">people you know who were literally a</text>
  <text start="2723.98" dur="5.46">week or two away from death and then</text>
  <text start="2726.89" dur="5.07">they got the antiretrovirals they</text>
  <text start="2729.44" dur="5.49">started working and they came back and</text>
  <text start="2731.96" dur="8.94">suddenly they&amp;#39;re acting to the world so</text>
  <text start="2734.93" dur="9.9">I think that the in my view of the world</text>
  <text start="2740.9" dur="8.699">I am fighting because I know that if</text>
  <text start="2744.83" dur="7.89">science tells the truth uses its immense</text>
  <text start="2749.599" dur="5.76">resources that they can find answers for</text>
  <text start="2752.72" dur="6.24">my daughter not just for my daughter but</text>
  <text start="2755.359" dur="6.181">I think that if we truly understand</text>
  <text start="2758.96" dur="4.71">what&amp;#39;s going on in the immune system we</text>
  <text start="2761.54" dur="7.62">are looking at a revolution in our</text>
  <text start="2763.67" dur="8.49">health because we can be healthy to the</text>
  <text start="2769.16" dur="6.06">to you know our last days alive and</text>
  <text start="2772.16" dur="6.87">maybe know we we push the average</text>
  <text start="2775.22" dur="7.44">lifespan from 80 85 to 95 or a hundred I</text>
  <text start="2779.03" dur="6.74">mean big thing yeah yeah I think that</text>
  <text start="2782.66" dur="7.13">that&amp;#39;s possible and so so I am not</text>
  <text start="2785.77" dur="7.69">saddened by what&amp;#39;s happened I am</text>
  <text start="2789.79" dur="6.519">inspired because I think that we</text>
  <text start="2793.46" dur="4.98">can turn this around and you know let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2796.309" dur="4.321">turn Big Pharma into little Pharma I</text>
  <text start="2798.44" dur="4.86">think there&amp;#39;s a place for medications in</text>
  <text start="2800.63" dur="6.449">our world it you know in way that is you</text>
  <text start="2803.3" dur="5.58">know looked at and you know with plague</text>
  <text start="2807.079" dur="7.381">of corruption what I&amp;#39;m really trying to</text>
  <text start="2808.88" dur="7.679">do is I think that the word drain of the</text>
  <text start="2814.46" dur="4.889">expression drain is swamp and really</text>
  <text start="2816.559" dur="5.79">become emblematic so I&amp;#39;m really trying</text>
  <text start="2819.349" dur="6.75">to make this expression plague of</text>
  <text start="2822.349" dur="6.691">corruption emblematic of what has</text>
  <text start="2826.099" dur="5.281">happened in science so what I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="2829.04" dur="5.309">to do and that I hope that your</text>
  <text start="2831.38" dur="5.969">listeners will do is you can go on and</text>
  <text start="2834.349" dur="6.571">get it on Amazon Barnes and Noble it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2837.349" dur="5.551">coming out in on March 3rd 2020 but the</text>
  <text start="2840.92" dur="4.889">reason why I want people to buy it so</text>
  <text start="2842.9" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s only about 220 pages so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2845.809" dur="6.241">quick read where Canady read it on a</text>
  <text start="2848.69" dur="7.5">single plane flight so it&amp;#39;s a quick read</text>
  <text start="2852.05" dur="6.509">and the reason is because if I sell a</text>
  <text start="2856.19" dur="4.95">lot of books meaning I sell seven ten</text>
  <text start="2858.559" dur="5.25">thousand books by the time it publishes</text>
  <text start="2861.14" dur="5.07">what that means is that it ends up on</text>
  <text start="2863.809" dur="3.78">best the bestseller list it can end up</text>
  <text start="2866.21" dur="5.73">on the New York Times bestseller list</text>
  <text start="2867.589" dur="6.421">that opens a whole lot of venues for me</text>
  <text start="2871.94" dur="4.859">so what I&amp;#39;m trying to do is I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="2874.01" dur="5.19">to talk to the community and today this</text>
  <text start="2876.799" dur="5.491">is a really worthwhile book you&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="2879.2" dur="6.21">your eyes open for those of you who are</text>
  <text start="2882.29" dur="7.35">queue followers who look at things like</text>
  <text start="2885.41" dur="6.72">the Federal Reserve think of all of the</text>
  <text start="2889.64" dur="4.979">ways that you understand corruption in</text>
  <text start="2892.13" dur="6.87">this world and I think you&amp;#39;ll find</text>
  <text start="2894.619" dur="7.261">that&amp;#39;s in some ways a familiar story but</text>
  <text start="2899" dur="4.92">you know as human beings as long as</text>
  <text start="2901.88" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;re on earth we&amp;#39;re trying to make the</text>

  <text start="2907.819" dur="5.971">writing my books I&amp;#39;ve done what I can so</text>
  <text start="2911.75" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m encouraging other people to do what</text>
  <text start="2913.79" dur="5.22">they can become</text>
  <text start="2914.99" dur="5.91">educated like I said it&amp;#39;s 220 pages it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2919.01" dur="4.64">an amazing story of what she&amp;#39;s gone</text>

  <text start="2923.65" dur="6.26">when she tries to buck the system</text>
  <text start="2926.76" dur="4.44">yeah and and Duty is a great friend of</text>

  <text start="2935.97" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;re gonna get more flat than you can</text>
  <text start="2938.16" dur="3.27">imagine when that happens because</text>
