  <text start="77.07" dur="4.11">little bit it pays my cell phone every</text>
  <text start="78.659" dur="4.231">month alright of course when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="3.93">using the Amazon affiliate link it only</text>
  <text start="82.89" dur="4.019">lasts in your browser of the cookies for</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="3.869">about 24 hours so every time you go to</text>
  <text start="86.909" dur="4.741">buy on Amazon you would go to that link</text>
  <text start="88.979" dur="5.07">maybe bookmark that link and then that</text>
  <text start="91.65" dur="3.99">person will get you know two three four</text>
  <text start="94.049" dur="4.201">percent of something you know not really</text>

  <text start="113.759" dur="2.671">lot of different ones I&amp;#39;ve put a lot of</text>
  <text start="115.17" dur="3.72">time and effort into that because I</text>
  <text start="116.43" dur="5.189">wanted to cover all of the things that I</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="4.11">use and then share that with others I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="123" dur="4.229">are probably pretty cool and I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="125.159" dur="4.08">open suggestions but that affiliate</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="4.62">income creates sort of a recurring</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="4.651">customer base where you&amp;#39;re referring</text>
  <text start="131.849" dur="4.651">them to this business in that business</text>

  <text start="138.39" dur="3.89">you&amp;#39;re not dependent on any of the</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="4.65">payment processors like PayPal or</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="4.42">GoFundMe or any of these others that&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="3.57">just ban you if you&amp;#39;re talking about the</text>
  <text start="146.7" dur="3.87">wrong things and you&amp;#39;re not depending on</text>

  <text start="154.86" dur="4.74">move in the long term it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="3.21">help short-term unless they&amp;#39;re just huge</text>
  <text start="159.6" dur="3.18">and they can make a ton of money on</text>
  <text start="160.86" dur="5.01">affiliates or something like that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="4.83">going so you know I you know it builds</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="3.869">out in one month it&amp;#39;s five dollars the</text>

  <text start="169.739" dur="5.911">times 15 different things it&amp;#39;s not bad</text>

  <text start="194.519" dur="3.78">friendlier than having to just ask for</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="3.9">donations all the time but the big thing</text>
  <text start="198.299" dur="3.901">that I want to discuss with you guys is</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="3.54">crypto currencies alright I know many of</text>

  <text start="206.88" dur="6.359">crypto currencies are legitimate or or</text>
  <text start="209.549" dur="5.391">whatever you cannot deny one thing it is</text>
  <text start="213.239" dur="4.411">a way to send money that no one can stop</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="4.12">it is a way to send money directly to</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="4.41">the people that you try and send money</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="4.26">to rather than through a bank that could</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="5.25">potentially freeze your account or</text>
  <text start="223.32" dur="6.03">something like that and it is a way to</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="4.35">send it directly and instantly with</text>
  <text start="229.35" dur="4.77">small or low or in some cases no fees</text>
  <text start="231.66" dur="4.23">alright it&amp;#39;s a bit of a headache to</text>
  <text start="234.12" dur="3.39">learn the stuff because yeah you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="3.18">a you&amp;#39;ve got to go through and learn the</text>
  <text start="237.51" dur="3.09">whole new system it&amp;#39;s kind of like an</text>
  <text start="239.07" dur="3.66">email you know the first time you had to</text>
  <text start="240.6" dur="3.18">learn email or have a friend walk you</text>
  <text start="242.73" dur="2.94">through how to do that what is this</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="3.87">email thing how do I send an email well</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s just the same basically it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="5.19">send it to an address the address could</text>
  <text start="250.23" dur="3.9">be their name or it couldn&amp;#39;t be their</text>
  <text start="252.84" dur="4.29">name it could be tied to their name but</text>
  <text start="254.13" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s just a string of digits and just</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="3.84">like your email address everyone has</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="4.11">their own unique one it&amp;#39;s better than</text>
  <text start="260.97" dur="3.24">credit cards it&amp;#39;s safer for people to</text>
  <text start="262.77" dur="3.06">actually send money because when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.21" dur="2.639">giving out your credit card you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="1.74">actually giving them all of your</text>
  <text start="266.849" dur="2.431">personal information</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="3.15">hacker could just take that and then go</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="4.14">somewhere else and buy stuff with it you</text>
  <text start="270.72" dur="4.26">know your private card with the serial</text>
  <text start="273.42" dur="4.65">number all of that stuff all right the</text>
  <text start="274.98" dur="4.68">the secret code was it that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="3.06">remember CRV code or something like that</text>
  <text start="279.66" dur="4.17">on the back the three-digit code in the</text>
  <text start="281.13" dur="5.52">back plus your your your your expiration</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="4.17">date everything your name you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="286.65" dur="4.5">to do any of that with crypto so you</text>
  <text start="288" dur="5.16">just have a code and that code is unique</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="6.63">to every wallet</text>
  <text start="293.16" dur="6.33">I like this thing here this this bit fee</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="3.93">wallet which I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of money</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="3.45">on it but in theory I could hold</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="2.67">billions of dollars and no one could</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="3.15">ever ever ever steal it from me</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="4.68">all right if you guys haven&amp;#39;t heard</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="5.25">about the unhackable bitcoin wallet okay</text>
  <text start="309.06" dur="3.75">McAfee has actually dropped the the use</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="3.66">of the phrase unhackable because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="312.81" dur="3.9">creating a bunch of headache a lot of</text>
  <text start="315" dur="2.85">hackers are constantly creating drama</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="2.94">and stuff trying to say that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="317.85" dur="3.72">hacked into it you can actually hack</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="3.24">into the device play video games on it</text>
  <text start="321.57" dur="3.81">listen to music on and it&amp;#39;s similar to</text>
  <text start="322.89" dur="4.41">an Android phone it&amp;#39;s a very nice</text>
  <text start="325.38" dur="3.57">quality device but no one has ever</text>
  <text start="327.3" dur="3.75">stolen a penny from one of these things</text>
  <text start="328.95" dur="3.54">in fact McAfee had a two hundred and</text>
  <text start="331.05" dur="4.41">fifty thousand dollar reward for anyone</text>
  <text start="332.49" dur="4.26">that could and then this more recently</text>
  <text start="335.46" dur="2.76">you know there&amp;#39;s been a lot of hackers</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="4.68">who said they did this or that more</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="4.41">recently and the MSM of course are</text>
  <text start="341.43" dur="3.57">jumping on that try to make fun of</text>
  <text start="342.63" dur="5.34">McAfee but more recently he&amp;#39;s upped it</text>
  <text start="345" dur="4.68">to twenty million dollars offer to the</text>
  <text start="347.97" dur="4.41">hacker that said that he broke into it</text>
  <text start="349.68" dur="5.4">he said here&amp;#39;s the offer 20 million for</text>
  <text start="352.38" dur="4.53">you to come I&amp;#39;ll give you my device you</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="4.68">can stay in my home for free as long as</text>
  <text start="356.91" dur="6.24">it takes and of course the hacker said</text>
  <text start="359.76" dur="6">no so this is this is better than a bank</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="3.75">my friends I know that there are a lot</text>
  <text start="365.76" dur="4.53">of people out there who still think</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="5.04">riptos or evil or whatever I could</text>
  <text start="370.29" dur="4.32">address those arguments in a separate</text>
  <text start="371.94" dur="4.92">video if you guys want me to but you</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="4.47">know for example real fast let me just</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="3.81">go through I&amp;#39;ve been taking notes on</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="4.11">this because Jordan did a video about</text>
  <text start="380.67" dur="4.41">this and you know people in his comments</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="3.72">were tearing him up let&amp;#39;s talk about the</text>
  <text start="385.08" dur="4.02">mark of the beast argument against</text>
  <text start="386.91" dur="3.24">kryptos okay that that the one-world</text>
  <text start="389.1" dur="3.15">currency there&amp;#39;s a bunch of different</text>
  <text start="390.15" dur="5.1">ones but none of them really hold up to</text>
  <text start="392.25" dur="4.29">to scrutiny in my opinion so the mark of</text>
  <text start="395.25" dur="2.79">the beast comes from a story in the</text>
  <text start="396.54" dur="3.6">Bible&amp;#39;s New Testament in the Book of</text>

  <text start="412.47" dur="4.51">now because society is gravitating</text>
  <text start="415.24" dur="3.93">toward a cashless society that some</text>
  <text start="416.98" dur="6.87">curious characters believe Bitcoin will</text>
  <text start="419.17" dur="6.57">be the notorious mark in quote and that</text>
  <text start="423.85" dur="4.14">no man might buy or sell save he had</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="4.65">that mark or he had the mark or the name</text>

  <text start="430.39" dur="6.3">X explains revelations 13 17 however</text>
  <text start="434.89" dur="3.9">there are those in certain circles that</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="3.84">think this theory of Bitcoin might being</text>
  <text start="438.79" dur="3.42">the mark might be the opposite of what&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="459.85" dur="3.84">force you to use RFID chips in your head</text>
  <text start="462.07" dur="3.72">or your hand in order to use crypto</text>
  <text start="463.69" dur="4.32">currencies though they are attempting to</text>
  <text start="465.79" dur="4.08">implement systems of control using RFID</text>
  <text start="468.01" dur="3.33">and products and in certain corporations</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="2.82">they are asking people to put these</text>
  <text start="471.34" dur="4.02">chips in their hands in their head but</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="5.07">that is largely a dollar based system</text>
  <text start="475.36" dur="4.41">you could find people who have chosen to</text>

  <text start="479.77" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s not many but people have chosen</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="6.51">to insert RFID chip Bitcoin wallets but</text>
  <text start="484.57" dur="4.77">a stupid for one and you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="2.46">do that it&amp;#39;s completely like no one</text>
  <text start="489.34" dur="2.43">could ever make you have to do that</text>
  <text start="490.45" dur="2.91">because the whole system of Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="4.26">doesn&amp;#39;t work that way</text>
  <text start="493.36" dur="4.5">and in fact the idea that they could</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="3.66">control it at all is sort of silly</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="3.78">because they can it&amp;#39;s decentralized it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.69" dur="4.65">similar to ten people in a room each</text>

  <text start="524.62" dur="5.13">replicate itself so it&amp;#39;s not a system</text>
  <text start="526.93" dur="4.34">that can be controlled it&amp;#39;s not asset</text>
  <text start="529.75" dur="4.2">not from the top down there&amp;#39;s community</text>

  <text start="535.15" dur="5.49">it can&amp;#39;t be done from the top down like</text>
  <text start="537.37" dur="6.3">that unlike dollars you&amp;#39;re so wobbly</text>
  <text start="540.64" dur="4.23">you know the one-world currency argument</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="2.88">you know aren&amp;#39;t they gonna have just one</text>

  <text start="546.55" dur="4.98">blah blah No not only can they not</text>
  <text start="548.59" dur="4.47">control it but Bitcoin that&amp;#39;s one-world</text>
  <text start="551.53" dur="3.66">currency would never ever work it never</text>
  <text start="553.06" dur="3.48">happened in theory it could work and in</text>

  <text start="556.54" dur="2.01">currency</text>
  <text start="557.08" dur="3.36">not that I&amp;#39;ve ever thought I&amp;#39;d hear</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="4.83">myself say that because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.44" dur="5.28">uncontrollable however in reality there</text>
  <text start="563.38" dur="4.41">are already like a thousand plus maybe</text>
  <text start="565.72" dur="4.2">thousands at this point of different</text>
  <text start="567.79" dur="4.02">crypto currencies competing trying to be</text>
  <text start="569.92" dur="3.78">the best just like some of the companies</text>
  <text start="571.81" dur="4.08">you know capitalism it&amp;#39;s a beautiful</text>
  <text start="573.7" dur="4.62">thing so the idea of one of those ever</text>
  <text start="575.89" dur="5.21">being completely dominant of all others</text>
  <text start="578.32" dur="4.59">and you know that that&amp;#39;s kind of anti</text>
  <text start="581.1" dur="3.7">intellectual in the capitalist sense</text>
  <text start="582.91" dur="4.5">because obviously others are going to</text>
  <text start="584.8" dur="3.48">have a their own ideas their own</text>
  <text start="587.41" dur="2.31">innovations they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="588.28" dur="3.09">constantly competing with each other and</text>
  <text start="589.72" dur="3.33">keeping each other at the best possible</text>
  <text start="591.37" dur="6.87">value for the customer so the end users</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="5.91">and of course where was IV don&amp;#39;t bite me</text>
  <text start="598.24" dur="3.78">that hurts</text>
  <text start="598.96" dur="6.33">she&amp;#39;s getting a tooth in now of course</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="4.65">even within Bitcoin itself and this has</text>
  <text start="605.29" dur="3.24">happened before if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="3.99">disagreement between two big chunks of</text>
  <text start="608.53" dur="3.84">the community or 20 big chunks of the</text>
  <text start="610.66" dur="3.39">community there&amp;#39;s a process called</text>
  <text start="612.37" dur="4.11">forking and this is built into the</text>
  <text start="614.05" dur="4.44">design of most Kryptos especially</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="4.26">Bitcoin forking has already happened</text>
  <text start="618.49" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s where you got Bitcoin cash which</text>
  <text start="620.74" dur="3.45">is a completely different crypto based</text>
  <text start="622.21" dur="3.48">off of the same code of Bitcoin but they</text>
  <text start="624.19" dur="3.06">went to different ways they diverged</text>
  <text start="625.69" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re like I don&amp;#39;t agree with you</text>
  <text start="627.25" dur="3.81">about this anymore we&amp;#39;re gonna try a</text>
  <text start="628.87" dur="6.33">different way so they they forked off</text>
  <text start="631.06" dur="7.77">they split this is a non-violent</text>
  <text start="635.2" dur="5.34">peaceful way of disagreement and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="638.83" dur="3.39">beautiful system guys I really hope that</text>
  <text start="640.54" dur="3.69">you give it a chance</text>

  <text start="644.23" dur="3.93">pitch but I wanted to address a couple</text>
  <text start="645.91" dur="5.16">of those arguments because at the end of</text>
