  <text start="89.579" dur="3.991">they&amp;#39;d for some reason they can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="4.619">simple research on this particular</text>
  <text start="93.57" dur="6.089">product or they trusted him and that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="103.59" dur="3.69">on things but I feel terrible for people</text>
  <text start="105.27" dur="5.639">who are taking advantage of with trust</text>
  <text start="107.28" dur="5.97">so anyway moving on will expose him</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="4.14">later at some point I&amp;#39;ve invited him on</text>

  <text start="122.7" dur="5.399">talk more about that topic but you know</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="3.719">some of the exposure to low or moderate</text>
  <text start="128.099" dur="3.631">levels of toluene which is one of the</text>
  <text start="129.569" dur="3.681">solvents in say sixty before they bake</text>

  <text start="135.86" dur="5.13">normally get this in c60 but you have to</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="4.11">pay more many people are very cheap or</text>
  <text start="140.99" dur="2.91">they think that it won&amp;#39;t hurt them or</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="3.12">they don&amp;#39;t care because they&amp;#39;re selling</text>
  <text start="143.9" dur="4.02">it somebody else you know they that&amp;#39;s</text>
