  <text start="139.77" dur="5.88">figure out how to open up one particular</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="6.27">subset of individuals one particular</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="6.03">niche into understanding or being aware</text>
  <text start="149.13" dur="4.47">of the other niches you know this is the</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="5.369">divide and conquer strategy is one that</text>
  <text start="153.6" dur="6.27">is employed by the powers that be if we</text>
  <text start="157.049" dur="5.011">want to call them that to keep us under</text>
  <text start="159.87" dur="4.02">their control when we&amp;#39;re divided we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="163.89" dur="5.849">unaware and that&amp;#39;s how they can bring</text>
  <text start="165.81" dur="6.06">forth their particular agendas so by</text>
  <text start="169.739" dur="4.111">connecting these communities these</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="4.5">groups of people and getting them aware</text>
  <text start="173.85" dur="5.28">of each other&amp;#39;s communities aware of</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s going on elsewhere getting people</text>
  <text start="179.13" dur="3.6">within the alternative health realm to</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="3.6">understand say the encroachment of</text>
  <text start="182.73" dur="3.509">government as Dustin was saying or maybe</text>
  <text start="184.35" dur="4.109">what&amp;#39;s going on with the defense</text>
  <text start="186.239" dur="3.84">contractors and the energy technologies</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="4.351">over here that are hidden from us or</text>
  <text start="190.079" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s going on over here in the</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="4.2">political spectrum what&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="194.579" dur="4.051">suppose so we&amp;#39;re figuring out how to do</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="3.81">all that bring people together into all</text>
  <text start="198.63" dur="5.49">these subjects and how to do it</text>
  <text start="200.82" dur="5.4">responsibly carefully of course</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="4.709">everybody&amp;#39;s on different parts of their</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="5.4">pasts may be awakened more to certain</text>
  <text start="208.829" dur="4.651">subjects than others so I&amp;#39;m going to be</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="3.02">very careful and tactful with how we do</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="2.99">that but there</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;re gentle but that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="216.47" dur="6.33">but effective yeah well it&amp;#39;s great to be</text>
  <text start="219.83" dur="4.62">here and it seems like we&amp;#39;ve gotten a</text>
  <text start="222.8" dur="4.83">really good response so far like no one</text>
  <text start="224.45" dur="4.619">has been really offended by you know my</text>
  <text start="227.63" dur="2.88">booth over here which is really</text>
  <text start="229.069" dur="5.311">presenting the full picture on one piece</text>
  <text start="230.51" dur="6.63">of paper and like yeah I&amp;#39;m really here</text>
  <text start="234.38" dur="4.29">to sort of expose these people who you</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="4.26">know their first red pill their first</text>
  <text start="238.67" dur="5.16">rabbit hole has been vaccine injury you</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="5.79">know it&amp;#39;s a really traumatic way to be</text>
  <text start="243.83" dur="4.56">woken up unfortunately but you know I</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="3.93">don&amp;#39;t think too many people come to this</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="4.5">conference unless they&amp;#39;ve already had a</text>
  <text start="251.12" dur="3.27">vaccine injury happens as one of their</text>
  <text start="252.89" dur="3.39">children or something because I mean a</text>
  <text start="254.39" dur="3.9">lot of the stuff at this conference</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="3.87">could be really great for prevention but</text>
  <text start="258.29" dur="3.12">you know people aren&amp;#39;t coming here when</text>
  <text start="260.15" dur="3.03">they get pregnant they don&amp;#39;t come to</text>
  <text start="261.41" dur="3.66">autism one it&amp;#39;s not the first thing they</text>
  <text start="263.18" dur="4.47">think of so unfortunately these people</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="4.8">have been exposed to the world of truth</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="6.69">in a really brutal way that has really</text>
  <text start="269.87" dur="6.81">like traumatized their family but in a</text>
  <text start="274.34" dur="4.77">way it has you know awoken them in a</text>
  <text start="276.68" dur="3.9">very in a very strong sense and I think</text>
  <text start="279.11" dur="2.94">that a lot of these people are sort of</text>
  <text start="280.58" dur="4.68">ready to understand the bigger picture</text>
  <text start="282.05" dur="5.58">ready to understand why the mainstream</text>
  <text start="285.26" dur="5.219">medical industry has sort of failed them</text>
  <text start="287.63" dur="6.3">and that&amp;#39;s what the bigger picture panel</text>
  <text start="290.479" dur="4.891">is gonna address so hopefully it will do</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="2.79">a good job at that you know I&amp;#39;m here</text>
  <text start="295.37" dur="4.5">getting out a lot of my free this is</text>
  <text start="296.72" dur="6.21">sort of what I&amp;#39;ve designed as the most</text>
  <text start="299.87" dur="6.06">potent red filling device I could I</text>
  <text start="302.93" dur="4.32">could imagine creating so did you I just</text>
  <text start="305.93" dur="3.87">want to say something about this how</text>
  <text start="307.25" dur="4.41">potent it is so the combat Comedy</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="3.84">Central actually featured this in a skit</text>
  <text start="311.66" dur="2.67">they did once and it wasn&amp;#39;t featuring it</text>
  <text start="313.64" dur="2.91">in a good way</text>
  <text start="314.33" dur="4.05">it was featuring it to discredit it but</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="5.85">wane comedy central feature of this this</text>
  <text start="318.38" dur="6.18">is about a year ago or so I looked at</text>
  <text start="322.4" dur="3.84">the screen shot that Comedy Central</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="4.05">shared from this and what they actually</text>
  <text start="326.24" dur="4.14">did was edited the words in it so for</text>
  <text start="328.61" dur="4.41">instance there&amp;#39;s the words secret space</text>
  <text start="330.38" dur="5.61">program on here that&amp;#39;s a fun topic to</text>
  <text start="333.02" dur="4.83">research they edited to say space secret</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="3.47">program they took out the space it just</text>
  <text start="337.85" dur="4.569">said secret program secret</text>
  <text start="339.46" dur="6.329">secret what secret program so this is to</text>
  <text start="342.419" dur="5.891">hard core this is to truth for them to</text>
  <text start="345.789" dur="4.171">show unedited on Comedy Central and</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;ve also what reported on this in</text>
  <text start="349.96" dur="4.139">the wopo and Guapo publish Washington</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="3.899">like a tweet from a random person</text>
  <text start="354.099" dur="3.781">showing this but I mean it was really</text>
  <text start="356.169" dur="3.661">high kind of people read was it the New</text>
  <text start="357.88" dur="3.15">York Times it it was either Washington</text>
  <text start="359.83" dur="2.55">Post in the New York Times I saw that</text>
  <text start="361.03" dur="3.479">did feature this whole thing in their</text>
  <text start="362.38" dur="3.509">article yeah of course trying to miss</text>
  <text start="364.509" dur="5.431">credit the whole that still blows my</text>
  <text start="365.889" dur="5.851">mind that they would show that but I was</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="3.479">gonna add to that I know that you know</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="3.81">when I put the book out as well kind of</text>
  <text start="373.419" dur="3.391">a red bull red pill device they they</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t like these things at all getting</text>
  <text start="376.81" dur="3.57">out there and in this map basically it</text>
  <text start="379.03" dur="2.97">looks a little confusing but the point</text>
  <text start="380.38" dur="2.909">is that everything is connected all this</text>
  <text start="382" dur="3.419">bad stuff going on in the world it</text>
  <text start="383.289" dur="3.901">really usually goes back to just a few</text>
  <text start="385.419" dur="3.06">people that have too much power and they</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="2.909">you know they got corrupt and we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="388.479" dur="3.72">pay attention you know that happens</text>
  <text start="390.099" dur="4.651">every so often people you know watch too</text>
  <text start="392.199" dur="3.69">much TV so we&amp;#39;ve got some bad folks</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="2.729">they&amp;#39;re hurting a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="5.34">there we got to sort of wake up this</text>
  <text start="397.479" dur="5.761">army of honestly thousands and thousands</text>
  <text start="401.229" dur="3.87">if not hundreds of thousands of Tiger</text>
  <text start="403.24" dur="3.75">moms with hurt babies there they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.099" dur="4.141">know it yet but Big Pharma is behind</text>
  <text start="406.99" dur="4.35">that and a lot of that was I would say</text>
  <text start="409.24" dur="3.179">intentional but that&amp;#39;s just my position</text>
  <text start="411.34" dur="3.629">but</text>
  <text start="412.419" dur="3.9">we could we could definitely bring them</text>
  <text start="414.969" dur="4.5">around to some of the stuff that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="416.319" dur="6">on some of the why some of the how not</text>
  <text start="419.469" dur="5.401">just this autism issue but the greater</text>
  <text start="422.319" dur="3.931">picture I mean the CDC the the big</text>
  <text start="424.87" dur="3">pharma I mean they know about the</text>
  <text start="426.25" dur="3.24">revolving door to some degree but it</text>
  <text start="427.87" dur="3.03">goes beyond that it goes into so many</text>
  <text start="429.49" dur="3.81">other issues that sell out of our</text>
  <text start="430.9" dur="4.44">culture of our country of our orders of</text>
  <text start="433.3" dur="3.63">everything else so you know wherever you</text>
  <text start="435.34" dur="4.289">stand on politics it&amp;#39;s a free speech</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="5.13">issue and we at least can stand by them</text>
  <text start="439.629" dur="4.32">on that and if we could tie this in and</text>
  <text start="442.06" dur="3.96">show those Tiger moms the real enemy and</text>
  <text start="443.949" dur="4.141">you have an army of volunteers that will</text>
  <text start="446.02" dur="4.679">never give up and never surrender no</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="4.829">matter what so that&amp;#39;s kind of the goal I</text>
  <text start="450.699" dur="3.631">hope that we can pull it off you know</text>
  <text start="452.919" dur="3.691">hopefully you guys have some more ideas</text>
  <text start="454.33" dur="3.51">than I do but you know I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="456.61" dur="3.559">gonna at least present the information</text>
  <text start="457.84" dur="4.799">present the arguments like people</text>
  <text start="460.169" dur="3.52">breadcrumbed them and they can read hill</text>
  <text start="462.639" dur="2.43">they can go a little further down the</text>

  <text start="483.039" dur="3.331">think we need to do anything different I</text>
  <text start="484.779" dur="3">think exactly what we&amp;#39;re doing right now</text>
  <text start="486.37" dur="2.699">we just need to keep doing this is why</text>
  <text start="487.779" dur="2.431">they&amp;#39;re censoring us so heavily is</text>
  <text start="489.069" dur="3.78">because we&amp;#39;re being pretty darn</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="7.319">effective with our true sharing on the</text>
  <text start="492.849" dur="6.72">Internet I mean that&amp;#39;s pretty much into</text>
  <text start="497.529" dur="3.29">this panel that we&amp;#39;re about to do I</text>
  <text start="499.569" dur="5.1">think we&amp;#39;re each going to talk about</text>
  <text start="500.819" dur="5.46">part of the big picture and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="504.669" dur="4.59">told I&amp;#39;m gonna go first so I&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="506.279" dur="4.991">give you guys an internet world like a</text>
  <text start="509.259" dur="5.52">little preview of like what we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="511.27" dur="6.149">cover in that panel which is I was sort</text>
  <text start="514.779" dur="4.38">of tasked to cover the depopulation</text>
  <text start="517.419" dur="5.461">agenda which we&amp;#39;re gonna be careful with</text>
  <text start="519.159" dur="5.161">that terminology but as a lot of people</text>
  <text start="522.88" dur="3.48">who have seen the cubeb before know like</text>
  <text start="524.32" dur="4.86">there is the light green section which</text>
  <text start="526.36" dur="3.15">is labeled G population a nicer term for</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="3.36">that</text>
  <text start="529.51" dur="5.34">the population control it has also been</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="4.11">called family planning can we try to</text>
  <text start="534.85" dur="2.22">make up some more hardcore terms for</text>
  <text start="536.65" dur="6.27">that</text>
  <text start="537.07" dur="7.44">well extermination yeah and it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="542.92" dur="3.12">sometimes even just called like women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.51" dur="3.66">rights like they really sugarcoat it</text>
  <text start="546.04" dur="3.42">down and like make it sound like</text>
  <text start="548.17" dur="4.29">something that&amp;#39;s very nice and friendly</text>
  <text start="549.46" dur="5.28">when you know women&amp;#39;s rights involved</text>
  <text start="552.46" dur="3.81">like giving them vaccine maybe for their</text>
  <text start="554.74" dur="4.62">child but then you know what do they put</text>
  <text start="556.27" dur="4.74">in the vaccine they put in HIV if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="559.36" dur="5.91">not we need to feed the world the GMOs</text>
  <text start="561.01" dur="6.81">right yeah so I&amp;#39;m gonna go into that a</text>
  <text start="565.27" dur="4.02">little bit in a in a gentle way and then</text>
  <text start="567.82" dur="4.08">go into a little bit of the history of</text>
  <text start="569.29" dur="5.18">Western medicine which from what I found</text>
  <text start="571.9" dur="5.01">seems like it actually came out of a</text>
  <text start="574.47" dur="4">military operation you know we all know</text>
  <text start="576.91" dur="3.51">from a secret space program that like</text>
  <text start="578.47" dur="3.48">the most advanced technology all comes</text>
  <text start="580.42" dur="3.69">out of the military and what most people</text>
  <text start="581.95" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t realize is that the most advanced</text>
  <text start="584.11" dur="4.68">medicine in a way also comes out of the</text>
  <text start="586.03" dur="4.86">military and that some of these Health</text>
  <text start="588.79" dur="4.05">Organization&amp;#39;s in America that we think</text>
  <text start="590.89" dur="4.26">our civilian are actually controlled by</text>
  <text start="592.84" dur="4.38">the military like I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure</text>
  <text start="595.15" dur="5.19">the structure I&amp;#39;ve looked it up but um</text>
  <text start="597.22" dur="4.74">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like if before but</text>
  <text start="600.34" dur="5.33">like certain agencies are like direct</text>
  <text start="601.96" dur="3.71">control under the military and others I</text>
  <text start="607.02" dur="5.11">mean no medical agency is gonna do</text>
  <text start="610.3" dur="3.99">anything that the defense industry says</text>
  <text start="612.13" dur="3.42">might be a national security threat you</text>
  <text start="614.29" dur="5.94">know like maybe hearing cancer or</text>
  <text start="615.55" dur="7.2">national security yeah at least in my</text>
  <text start="620.23" dur="5.07">research of the secret space program for</text>
  <text start="622.75" dur="4.56">energy realm yeah the military and the</text>
  <text start="625.3" dur="3.81">corporation&amp;#39;s do work together not</text>
  <text start="627.31" dur="3.48">saying the military in general you know</text>
  <text start="629.11" dur="3.39">but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s groups it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s rogue</text>
  <text start="630.79" dur="3.48">factions within the military working</text>
  <text start="632.5" dur="4.08">with rogue factions within the</text>
  <text start="634.27" dur="4.86">corporations and they keep them sell</text>
  <text start="636.58" dur="4.68">they work together so I like to call it</text>
  <text start="639.13" dur="5.25">like a quasi corporate governmental</text>
  <text start="641.26" dur="5.07">structure we have groups from rogue</text>
  <text start="644.38" dur="3.3">military world corporations they come</text>
  <text start="646.33" dur="4.59">together on their own I guess we could</text>
  <text start="647.68" dur="5.58">call it a secret society and it remains</text>
  <text start="650.92" dur="4.77">unacknowledged meaning that this program</text>
  <text start="653.26" dur="3.75">doesn&amp;#39;t nobody talks about even the</text>
  <text start="655.69" dur="2.91">people within the program don&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="657.01" dur="3.78">about it to anybody that&amp;#39;s not in the</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="3.57">program so you could have people in</text>
  <text start="660.79" dur="4.47">Congress or even even the Prez</text>
  <text start="662.17" dur="4.5">himself or herself has no idea about</text>
  <text start="665.26" dur="4.17">these programs and doesn&amp;#39;t have access</text>
  <text start="666.67" dur="4.859">into them because they are outside us</text>
  <text start="669.43" dur="3.779">are basically a black program can happen</text>
  <text start="671.529" dur="3.661">in the defense contracting with the</text>
  <text start="673.209" dur="4.611">space technologies can happen with</text>
  <text start="675.19" dur="5.97">health technologies and whatnot</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="3.97">pharmaceuticals so trillions missing</text>
  <text start="681.16" dur="4.619">dollars</text>
  <text start="681.79" dur="5.94">and where did that go yeah any agreement</text>
  <text start="685.779" dur="4.461">between government contractors are</text>
  <text start="687.73" dur="4.74">people getting government grants I think</text>
  <text start="690.24" dur="4.209">some of that is public that any of it</text>
  <text start="692.47" dur="3.51">has the potential to be privatized and</text>
  <text start="694.449" dur="3">I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a lot of meetings and</text>
  <text start="695.98" dur="4.2">discussions that go on between like the</text>
  <text start="697.449" dur="4.651">CDC FDA and private industry that are</text>
  <text start="700.18" dur="3.48">completely you know it&amp;#39;s not a black</text>
  <text start="702.1" dur="3.21">project there&amp;#39;s completely off the</text>
  <text start="703.66" dur="3.57">public record I know that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="705.31" dur="3.389">recently changed it so that you know</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="3.06">basically if they call it a national</text>
  <text start="708.699" dur="3.69">security reason okay</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="4.65">even private companies no longer have to</text>
  <text start="712.389" dur="4.831">even report their numbers I mean this is</text>
  <text start="714.94" dur="4.019">all beyond the audit beyond the books</text>
  <text start="717.22" dur="3.45">like you just get to do what you want</text>
  <text start="718.959" dur="3.57">make up the numbers now because it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="720.67" dur="3.599">important of a number it&amp;#39;s too it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="722.529" dur="3.661">obvious to show what&amp;#39;s really going on</text>
  <text start="724.269" dur="3.361">and they purposely keep a lot of the</text>
  <text start="726.19" dur="3.81">research and a lot of the numbers within</text>
  <text start="727.63" dur="4.079">the corporations because government is</text>
  <text start="730" dur="2.64">subject to FOIA requests Freedom of</text>
  <text start="731.709" dur="5.101">Information Act</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="5.58">now the government can redact stuff from</text>
  <text start="736.81" dur="2.459">FOIA requests you can file a FOIA</text>
  <text start="738.22" dur="2.94">request doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="739.269" dur="5.13">all the info you want or your question</text>
  <text start="741.16" dur="5.76">answered but corporations aren&amp;#39;t subject</text>
  <text start="744.399" dur="4.411">to FOIA requests so there&amp;#39;s been bits</text>
  <text start="746.92" dur="3.93">and pieces of information leaking out</text>
  <text start="748.81" dur="5.1">from government databases because of</text>
  <text start="750.85" dur="5.31">FOIA for a long time and they want to</text>
  <text start="753.91" dur="3.539">stop that so they&amp;#39;re giving the</text>
  <text start="756.16" dur="2.88">corporation&amp;#39;s a lot more power and</text>
  <text start="757.449" dur="4.051">influence I was just talking earlier</text>
  <text start="759.04" dur="4.83">with an individual who was talking about</text>
  <text start="761.5" dur="4.56">FOIA and corporations and government she</text>
  <text start="763.87" dur="3.99">was saying that there&amp;#39;s pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="766.06" dur="5.7">companies out there who take in taxpayer</text>
  <text start="767.86" dur="7.469">dollars and research pharmaceuticals</text>
  <text start="771.76" dur="6.84">with that and ask for FOIA and some</text>
  <text start="775.329" dur="5.101">loophole laws or whatever they they have</text>
  <text start="778.6" dur="3.39">to admit I don&amp;#39;t they have to admit but</text>
  <text start="780.43" dur="4.709">we know they&amp;#39;re taxpayer funded but they</text>
  <text start="781.99" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t have to tell us what the results</text>
  <text start="785.139" dur="3.991">of their studies were so even the</text>
  <text start="786.94" dur="4.56">studies even the research not just</text>
  <text start="789.13" dur="4.65">telling us where the money goes or</text>
  <text start="791.5" dur="8.61">to have research from it the publicly</text>
  <text start="793.78" dur="8.37">funded research they keep quiet one of</text>
  <text start="800.11" dur="3.72">the last points I added on here that was</text>
  <text start="802.15" dur="3.87">sort of like the last-minute addition</text>
  <text start="803.83" dur="3.93">was this right at the little upper right</text>
  <text start="806.02" dur="4.62">corner of the Big Pharma section which</text>
  <text start="807.76" dur="4.29">is rigged clinical trials which i think</text>
  <text start="810.64" dur="3.47">is a really important concept to</text>
  <text start="812.05" dur="4.86">understand that just because you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="814.11" dur="5.35">results from a clinical trial doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="816.91" dur="4.56">mean that it&amp;#39;s actually true it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="819.46" dur="4.68">easy to fudge a study I see Columbia</text>
  <text start="821.47" dur="5.7">maybe I would say most clinical trials</text>
  <text start="824.14" dur="4.68">are a large chunk of them are begun with</text>
  <text start="827.17" dur="4.86">the intent of finding a specific result</text>
  <text start="828.82" dur="5.25">and that the whole trial is engineered</text>
  <text start="832.03" dur="3.75">to find that result and if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="834.07" dur="5.34">find it they start changing the rules of</text>
  <text start="835.78" dur="5.58">the trial because you ain&amp;#39;t gonna get</text>
  <text start="839.41" dur="2.73">you money if you don&amp;#39;t get the result we</text>
  <text start="841.36" dur="2.97">want all right</text>
  <text start="842.14" dur="5.28">they don&amp;#39;t get funded if they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="844.33" dur="5.43">the particular result Merc Merc itself</text>
  <text start="847.42" dur="5.28">was sued by two of its former virologist</text>
  <text start="849.76" dur="5.37">to form of Merck workers for altering a</text>
  <text start="852.7" dur="6.09">study they did about I believe it was</text>
  <text start="855.13" dur="6.45">the MMR anyway they didn&amp;#39;t get the the</text>
  <text start="858.79" dur="7.32">virologist didn&amp;#39;t get this result that</text>
  <text start="861.58" dur="8.67">Merck wanted so they went out and got</text>
  <text start="866.11" dur="6.6">some rabbit antibodies and put the</text>
  <text start="870.25" dur="4.35">rabbit antibodies in with the humans to</text>
  <text start="872.71" dur="3.66">mix it up and get the result they wanted</text>
  <text start="874.6" dur="5.03">so then they could bring that and say</text>
  <text start="876.37" dur="6.45">hey our vaccines work so it sounds like</text>
  <text start="879.63" dur="5.81">does the second George Bush election</text>
  <text start="882.82" dur="4.87">well we know at least you know without</text>
  <text start="885.44" dur="3.72">you know going too much in the politics</text>
  <text start="887.69" dur="4.29">side we know that there&amp;#39;s a corrupt</text>
  <text start="889.16" dur="3.96">system we can&amp;#39;t necessarily trust you</text>
  <text start="891.98" dur="2.31">know the people that are supposed to be</text>
  <text start="893.12" dur="3.93">taking care of our health and we keep</text>
  <text start="894.29" dur="5.31">getting sick early so Jordan and tell us</text>
  <text start="897.05" dur="3.979">about your part of it and I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="899.6" dur="4.38">curious about it because you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="901.029" dur="4.841">areas of expertise I don&amp;#39;t even go into</text>
  <text start="903.98" dur="4.53">like the secret space program I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="905.87" dur="4.23">even find time to do that so I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="908.51" dur="3.6">interested to learn kind of your</text>
  <text start="910.1" dur="3.39">thoughts on on what strategies we can</text>
  <text start="912.11" dur="7.5">take in front of what areas you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="913.49" dur="7.8">cover but to win basically lines</text>
  <text start="919.61" dur="3.72">basically we have going on right now is</text>
  <text start="921.29" dur="3.78">it propaganda war and we have we have</text>
  <text start="923.33" dur="3.449">their black propaganda their fake news</text>
  <text start="925.07" dur="4.05">propaganda that we have to combat with</text>
  <text start="926.779" dur="4.231">our own propaganda not saying propaganda</text>
  <text start="929.12" dur="4.14">as a loaded word meaning you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="931.01" dur="3.81">mind control somebody yet maybe we could</text>
  <text start="933.26" dur="3.06">call it white propaganda truth Floyd</text>
  <text start="934.82" dur="2.88">that propaganda there&amp;#39;s some you have</text>
  <text start="936.32" dur="3.54">white in front of some counter probably</text>
  <text start="937.7" dur="4.199">counter at truthful propaganda that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="939.86" dur="6.33">called that is true yeah so basically</text>
  <text start="941.899" dur="7.531">it&amp;#39;s an info war to use that term and</text>
  <text start="946.19" dur="8.58">it&amp;#39;s a proper terminology there it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="949.43" dur="6.75">great term that&amp;#39;s been yeah and and I</text>
  <text start="954.77" dur="4.04">mean we&amp;#39;re winning that&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="956.18" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re being censored up to a right now</text>
  <text start="958.81" dur="3.76">channels are being taken down people are</text>
  <text start="961.07" dur="4.26">getting suspended off these platforms</text>
  <text start="962.57" dur="4.47">because we&amp;#39;re winning the Washington</text>
  <text start="965.33" dur="3.96">Post is running articles like how are</text>
  <text start="967.04" dur="4.29">these anti-vaxxers so coordinated and so</text>
  <text start="969.29" dur="3.39">effective in both of us it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="971.33" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re winning is what to do it so I</text>
  <text start="972.68" dur="8.64">don&amp;#39;t think we necessarily need to</text>
  <text start="974.33" dur="11.1">change but I do think that what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="981.32" dur="8.91">helpful is things like this conferences</text>
  <text start="985.43" dur="6.18">events we can research to our hearts</text>
  <text start="990.23" dur="2.94">content with the Internet at our</text>
  <text start="991.61" dur="5.419">fingertips and with YouTube and whatnot</text>
  <text start="993.17" dur="6.72">but researching and learning through</text>
  <text start="997.029" dur="4.75">secondhand say reading or videos is a</text>
  <text start="999.89" dur="5.73">lot different than actually experiencing</text>
  <text start="1001.779" dur="7.651">and having the experience of talking to</text>
  <text start="1005.62" dur="6.81">somebody where their child was harmed by</text>
  <text start="1009.43" dur="5.279">vaccines or you familiar with MMS</text>
  <text start="1012.43" dur="4.2">chlorine dioxide yeah I&amp;#39;ve been getting</text>
  <text start="1014.709" dur="7.201">a lot of crap in the media lately over</text>
  <text start="1016.63" dur="7.41">my discussion of MMS and I talked to a</text>
  <text start="1021.91" dur="3.779">woman earlier she&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1024.04" dur="3.24">taking MMS for the last three weeks I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1025.689" dur="4.471">like oh so it&amp;#39;s not a drinking bleach</text>
  <text start="1027.28" dur="6.96">like the media says so toxic drink</text>
  <text start="1030.16" dur="6.539">English so actually going and doing the</text>
  <text start="1034.24" dur="5.01">thing like going to the conference or</text>
  <text start="1036.699" dur="14.941">the event or out to that ranch and</text>
  <text start="1039.25" dur="13.59">actually experiencing it sort of our</text>
  <text start="1051.64" dur="2.789">secret weapon it&amp;#39;s like if the</text>
  <text start="1052.84" dur="3.66">Washington Post is wondering why it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1054.429" dur="3.661">effective you know a secret weapon and</text>
  <text start="1056.5" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re not trying to make so secret when</text>
  <text start="1058.09" dur="3.089">things actually make sense they tend to</text>
  <text start="1060.07" dur="4.37">be more effective than when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1061.179" dur="3.261">selling lies on top of lies</text>
  <text start="1065.25" dur="7.09">I agree this this is the heart of it</text>
  <text start="1070.809" dur="3.301">because this is where the community is</text>
  <text start="1072.34" dur="3.96">built and all the suffering all the pain</text>
  <text start="1074.11" dur="4.62">all the damage has been done it made</text>
  <text start="1076.3" dur="5.31">this it made this community it made this</text>
  <text start="1078.73" dur="4.41">culture and this doesn&amp;#39;t stop this</text>
  <text start="1081.61" dur="3.059">doesn&amp;#39;t go away and they have of course</text>
  <text start="1083.14" dur="3.9">the truth on their side but they have</text>
  <text start="1084.669" dur="4.081">you know like I said Tiger moms with</text>
  <text start="1087.04" dur="4.11">hurt babies they have passion that will</text>
  <text start="1088.75" dur="4.919">never stop they have a lifetime of</text>
  <text start="1091.15" dur="4.769">passion to give to a cause really all</text>
  <text start="1093.669" dur="4.051">they need is a way to channel it I think</text>
  <text start="1095.919" dur="3.541">I&amp;#39;m gonna focus my part of this talk on</text>
  <text start="1097.72" dur="4.199">on solutions and things that we can do</text>
  <text start="1099.46" dur="4.23">to boost our efforts mainly by</text>
  <text start="1101.919" dur="3.061">networking just getting boobs together</text>
  <text start="1103.69" dur="2.91">getting groups that are maybe not</text>
  <text start="1104.98" dur="4.05">talking together like you know we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1106.6" dur="5.13">the alt media we&amp;#39;re not necessarily part</text>
  <text start="1109.03" dur="4.62">of this anti-vaxxer or or whatever</text>
  <text start="1111.73" dur="3.25">community would be the alternative</text>
  <text start="1113.65" dur="3.62">health need</text>
  <text start="1114.98" dur="3.97">but we&amp;#39;re interesting because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1117.27" dur="3.99">free speech issue it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a human</text>
  <text start="1118.95" dur="2.85">issue we&amp;#39;re all sort of on on this</text>
  <text start="1121.26" dur="2.01">together</text>
  <text start="1121.8" dur="3.6">I mean some of us have children I mean</text>
  <text start="1123.27" dur="4.05">wait we care about these issues as well</text>
  <text start="1125.4" dur="4.2">and maybe we have a voice we could lend</text>
  <text start="1127.32" dur="3.98">to it maybe maybe they have some stories</text>
  <text start="1129.6" dur="4.26">to tell or maybe they need some</text>
  <text start="1131.3" dur="5.08">reinforcement or something to get some</text>
  <text start="1133.86" dur="3.84">protection from some sort of bully in</text>
  <text start="1136.38" dur="3.42">the government trying to take you know</text>

  <text start="1182.07" dur="4.02">I don&amp;#39;t even remember all of the details</text>
  <text start="1183.54" dur="3.96">of that but they are so going after her</text>
  <text start="1186.09" dur="2.82">right now they don&amp;#39;t want you to be able</text>
  <text start="1187.5" dur="4.44">to use your own body sometimes they want</text>
  <text start="1188.91" dur="4.59">you to pay for a $500,000 dose so I</text>
  <text start="1191.94" dur="4.29">think you know I&amp;#39;m going to talk about</text>
  <text start="1193.5" dur="4.86">what we can do to effect some change by</text>
  <text start="1196.23" dur="3.78">getting these Tiger moms and other</text>
  <text start="1198.36" dur="3.92">groups like that and have this passion</text>
  <text start="1200.01" dur="4.76">on the same platform</text>
  <text start="1202.28" dur="4.83">same page round sort of the free speech</text>
  <text start="1204.77" dur="3.6">issue and then what could we do together</text>
  <text start="1207.11" dur="3.21">I mean I think we&amp;#39;d have like the</text>
  <text start="1208.37" dur="5.19">largest special interest you know</text>
  <text start="1210.32" dur="5.4">Patriot or just citizen or alternative</text>
  <text start="1213.56" dur="3.48">health or free speech or type group</text>
  <text start="1215.72" dur="3.27">that&amp;#39;s ever been put together that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1217.04" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s kind of where I&amp;#39;ve been focusing</text>
  <text start="1218.99" dur="3.78">my passion lately just probably trying</text>
  <text start="1221.45" dur="4.11">to bring people together build a</text>
  <text start="1222.77" dur="4.38">roundtable increase solutions I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1225.56" dur="3.75">know what you guys think and do you want</text>
  <text start="1227.15" dur="4.17">to add anything yeah I think this event</text>
  <text start="1229.31" dur="6.48">is like really great for sort of uniting</text>
  <text start="1231.32" dur="6.24">people because I I&amp;#39;m assuming autism can</text>
  <text start="1235.79" dur="4.11">be kind of like or dealing with autism</text>
  <text start="1237.56" dur="3.78">can be kind of like you know being the</text>
  <text start="1239.9" dur="3.06">truth or not having anyone to talk to</text>
  <text start="1241.34" dur="3.93">about it you know only having really</text>
  <text start="1242.96" dur="4.13">your doctor to give you advice and then</text>
  <text start="1245.27" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re giving you shitty advice</text>
  <text start="1247.09" dur="4.45">possibly not saying all doctors advice</text>
  <text start="1249.47" dur="4.65">is shitty but they were trained the</text>
  <text start="1251.54" dur="4.17">wrong way but yeah I think to come here</text>
  <text start="1254.12" dur="3.27">connect with other people or even to</text>
  <text start="1255.71" dur="4.23">like you know maybe form groups</text>
  <text start="1257.39" dur="4.95">separately like form the way like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1259.94" dur="3.54">formed truth or groups like we still</text>
  <text start="1262.34" dur="4.11">call our truth or group they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1263.48" dur="4.74">writing the allusion jordiz dig but um</text>
  <text start="1266.45" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s basically like a truther group</text>
  <text start="1268.22" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve also call it like a tinfoil hat</text>
  <text start="1269.69" dur="5.19">group in Cincinnati but um you know if</text>
  <text start="1272.87" dur="3.33">if say look parents of autistic kids</text>
  <text start="1274.88" dur="3.3">could do something like that connect to</text>
  <text start="1276.2" dur="3.99">each other like find out from each other</text>
  <text start="1278.18" dur="4.35">like which of these remedies are working</text>
  <text start="1280.19" dur="4.29">which of them maybe have not worked</text>
  <text start="1282.53" dur="4.17">you know everyone responds differently</text>
  <text start="1284.48" dur="3.6">to different remedies but generally I</text>
  <text start="1286.7" dur="3.78">think some have been proven to be</text>
  <text start="1288.08" dur="4.53">actually effective and you know ones</text>
  <text start="1290.48" dur="5.13">that regular medical doctors aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1292.61" dur="4.5">really promoting so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1295.61" dur="3.44">important for people to connect and get</text>
  <text start="1297.11" dur="4.14">the first-hand experience to really</text>
  <text start="1299.05" dur="3.93">understand the truth as opposed to just</text>
  <text start="1301.25" dur="3.93">reading it online because definitely</text>
  <text start="1302.98" dur="4.12">with every medical condition you can</text>
  <text start="1305.18" dur="3.3">read a ton of stuff online but you know</text>
  <text start="1307.1" dur="3.15">you don&amp;#39;t really know for sure until</text>
  <text start="1308.48" dur="3.27">you&amp;#39;ve heard someone&amp;#39;s experience or if</text>
  <text start="1310.25" dur="1.89">you try it yourself if it actually works</text>
  <text start="1311.75" dur="2.46">or not</text>
  <text start="1312.14" dur="3.16">and there is bad information out there</text>
  <text start="1314.21" dur="2.74">and</text>
  <text start="1315.3" dur="3.69">you know I think this conference kind of</text>
  <text start="1316.95" dur="3.63">tries to avoid the term of like curing</text>
  <text start="1318.99" dur="3.3">autism even though I think for some</text>
  <text start="1320.58" dur="3.96">cases that has happened but you know</text>
  <text start="1322.29" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s no guarantee that for every case</text>
  <text start="1324.54" dur="5.43">like that remedy will cure the whole</text>
  <text start="1327.21" dur="4.08">condition but definitely from what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1329.97" dur="4.08">heard at this convention so far is that</text>
  <text start="1331.29" dur="4.35">you know some people but with certain</text>
  <text start="1334.05" dur="5.27">protocols certain treatments have</text>
  <text start="1335.64" dur="3.68">experienced almost complete regression</text>
  <text start="1350.33" dur="7.15">they didn&amp;#39;t they did yeah I think I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1354.81" dur="4.29">heard a lot of speakers and people</text>
  <text start="1357.48" dur="3.84">involved with this conference have faced</text>
  <text start="1359.1" dur="5.03">like severe repercussions in their</text>
  <text start="1361.32" dur="5.7">careers and personal lives in terms of</text>
  <text start="1364.13" dur="4.33">being banned being censored some people</text>
  <text start="1367.02" dur="3.48">from this conference as they bailed to</text>
  <text start="1368.46" dur="3.69">jail I know you talked to Judy</text>
  <text start="1370.5" dur="4.35">that means the truth is shared here</text>
  <text start="1372.15" dur="5.45">folks Judy&amp;#39;s elisa blowers gone to jail</text>
  <text start="1374.85" dur="2.75">for telling the truth</text>
  <text start="1391.13" dur="5.14">it&amp;#39;s kind of impromptu minutes or</text>
  <text start="1394.29" dur="3.93">something that can&amp;#39;t finish out for us</text>
  <text start="1396.27" dur="3.57">but I mean basically we covered kind of</text>
  <text start="1398.22" dur="4.5">the gist of what we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about</text>
  <text start="1399.84" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re gonna try to read pill breadcrumb</text>
  <text start="1402.72" dur="4.14">whatever people on some different topics</text>
  <text start="1404.61" dur="3.66">bring it all together and then find some</text>
  <text start="1406.86" dur="3.6">solutions you know let&amp;#39;s the spotter</text>
  <text start="1408.27" dur="3.54">here with a positive note and well right</text>
  <text start="1410.46" dur="3.78">here the very optimist we&amp;#39;re here to</text>

  <text start="1414.24" dur="3.45">autism on all the other subjects and</text>

  <text start="1417.69" dur="4.68">on autism and it&amp;#39;s just I mean I think</text>
  <text start="1420.54" dur="2.95">most of our audience has probably been</text>
  <text start="1422.37" dur="4.42">skeptical</text>
  <text start="1423.49" dur="6.21">of vaccines for you know some time now</text>
  <text start="1426.79" dur="4.32">yeah but like personally I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1429.7" dur="3.45">exactly like how much research was</text>
  <text start="1431.11" dur="4.86">really behind it you know if I had a kid</text>
  <text start="1433.15" dur="5.34">I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to do vaccines but I</text>
  <text start="1435.97" dur="4.17">would at least like it would at least be</text>
  <text start="1438.49" dur="3.54">like a point of like confusion in my</text>
  <text start="1440.14" dur="4.62">mind about like what exactly is the best</text>
  <text start="1442.03" dur="4.08">thing to do but having been here having</text>

  <text start="1451" dur="3.929">statistics about like really how much</text>
  <text start="1453.4" dur="3.96">vaccine injury is actually even</text>
  <text start="1454.929" dur="5.701">documented which might not be the</text>

  <text start="1714.739" dur="4.981">are safe and effective</text>
  <text start="1715.759" dur="7.64">however the Supreme Court ruled in 1986</text>

  <text start="2127.11" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t realize that and in the span of</text>
  <text start="2129.75" dur="3.45">their lifetime the vaccines have</text>
  <text start="2131.1" dur="4.74">increased like tenfold and that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2133.2" dur="5.4">really just like I mean I actually saw a</text>
  <text start="2135.84" dur="5.19">video for the first time just like last</text>

  <text start="2154.65" dur="3.24">all my vaccine information on and I just</text>
  <text start="2156.42" dur="3.96">compiled it because I like to debate</text>
  <text start="2157.89" dur="4.56">this topic off the top of my head he</text>
  <text start="2160.38" dur="3.69">mentioned Supreme Court case let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="2162.45" dur="3.2">through some of the myths of vaccines</text>
  <text start="2164.07" dur="3.44">that they try to push like</text>
  <text start="2165.65" dur="3.689">like well we got rid of polio right well</text>
  <text start="2167.51" dur="3.18">no you didn&amp;#39;t get rid of polio or any of</text>
  <text start="2169.339" dur="3.061">these other diseases they changed the</text>
  <text start="2170.69" dur="3.089">name yeah they changed the name to</text>
  <text start="2172.4" dur="3.3">prevent you knowing that it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="2173.779" dur="4.141">there but actually that all the grafts</text>
  <text start="2175.7" dur="4.169">were doing this sort of downward trends</text>
  <text start="2177.92" dur="3.57">then they introduced the vaccine that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2179.869" dur="3.571">almost always what happens it shoots</text>
  <text start="2181.49" dur="3.839">back up mini states actually banned the</text>
  <text start="2183.44" dur="3.899">polio vaccine for paralyzing and killing</text>
  <text start="2185.329" dur="4.141">people in mass and then it continues</text>
  <text start="2187.339" dur="5.28">this downward trend why is it that the</text>
  <text start="2189.47" dur="5.01">vaccines were late to the the save right</text>
  <text start="2192.619" dur="3.18">well the real reason is because we had</text>
  <text start="2194.48" dur="2.579">plumbing me at toilets we weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2195.799" dur="3.361">throwing our crap out in the streets</text>

  <text start="2203.27" dur="3.48">all the time once again modern</text>
  <text start="2205.069" dur="3.811">technology was there to the rescue and</text>
  <text start="2206.75" dur="3.869">we became a better healthier more</text>
  <text start="2208.88" dur="3.87">effective you know sort of the</text>
  <text start="2210.619" dur="3.391">capitalist idea of just always improving</text>
  <text start="2212.75" dur="3.299">things and getting better and better and</text>
