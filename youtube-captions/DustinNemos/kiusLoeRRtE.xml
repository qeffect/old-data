  <text start="0.68" dur="5.619">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.51" dur="5.879">most of destiny most calm and apex</text>
  <text start="6.299" dur="4.231">health dark Club and there&amp;#39;s only a few</text>
  <text start="9.389" dur="2.851">things I want to mention right now</text>
  <text start="10.53" dur="3.54">obviously there&amp;#39;s a lot of drama going</text>
  <text start="12.24" dur="4.53">on around the Clinton Foundation around</text>
  <text start="14.07" dur="6.03">Mueller and around Flynn and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="16.77" dur="4.62">gonna continue to evolve but let&amp;#39;s run</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="4.71">through just a few things I really</text>
  <text start="21.39" dur="5.729">wanted to get off off my list before if</text>
  <text start="24.81" dur="3.51">we continue on and I&amp;#39;ll check and see if</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="4.491">there&amp;#39;s any queue and I may just merge</text>
  <text start="28.32" dur="6.239">all of that into this video so we have</text>
  <text start="31.61" dur="5.8">potentially Johnson and Johnson may have</text>
  <text start="34.559" dur="7.261">known about the cancer-causing property</text>
  <text start="37.41" dur="9.51">of baby powder since as long ago as 1971</text>
  <text start="41.82" dur="7.41">and and they hid it for decades so you</text>
  <text start="46.92" dur="6.299">know obviously at the corporate you know</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="6.149">liability level like the first reaction</text>
  <text start="53.219" dur="6.451">and the continual reaction would just be</text>
  <text start="55.379" dur="6.151">this long denial like we didn&amp;#39;t do it we</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="2.54">have no responsibility and have no idea</text>
  <text start="61.53" dur="3.36">what you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="62.21" dur="5.71">the usual right like the usual corporate</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="7.62">line but from a human perspective</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="10.47">I mean continuing to poison babies with</text>
  <text start="72.51" dur="7.62">cancerous materials for decades that</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="3.75">takes a certain kind of ruthlessness</text>
  <text start="80.13" dur="6.9">right that obviously whoever made that</text>
  <text start="82.14" dur="6.42">call is clearly a psychopath anyway just</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="4.65">worth a mention</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="4.76">and speaking of poisons we also have the</text>
  <text start="91.68" dur="5.009">Hulk</text>
  <text start="93.32" dur="7.36">the original Hulk and and this is kind</text>
  <text start="96.689" dur="8.04">of a flashback to earlier TV but he</text>
  <text start="100.68" dur="7.85">actually gets a vaccine and gets sick</text>
  <text start="104.729" dur="6.03">from it and he&amp;#39;s in hospitalized so</text>
  <text start="108.53" dur="4.33">something something called a you know a</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="4.201">pneumonia vaccine vaccination and we</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="3.81">know these kind of like seasonal flu</text>
  <text start="114.96" dur="3.93">vaccines that sort of thing they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="5.36">worst of all of the vaccines in terms of</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="5.729">the toxic load that they seem to carry</text>
  <text start="122.03" dur="3.939">of course up there are some of the you</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="2.43">know the Gardasil &amp;#39;s and things like</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="5.04">that</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="5.071">this anthrax vaccine scares me a little</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="3.48">bit too</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="4.649">because you can&amp;#39;t really kill anthrax</text>
  <text start="134.489" dur="3.78">anyway so it&amp;#39;s very strange and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="136.769" dur="3.511">they&amp;#39;re only kind of forcing that one on</text>
  <text start="138.269" dur="4.11">military folks right now but you know</text>
  <text start="140.28" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s like thirty billion</text>
  <text start="142.379" dur="3.511">profit per vaccine that you can get</text>
  <text start="144.03" dur="6.09">mandated by law so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="6.84">market but this this was just in yet</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="3.929">another recent case I mean if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="152.73" dur="2.819">interested in the vaccine issue or you</text>
  <text start="154.049" dur="4.44">have your doubts please go to my website</text>
  <text start="155.549" dur="6.33">destiny most calm and scroll down to the</text>
  <text start="158.489" dur="5.701">vaccine section I have recently added</text>
  <text start="161.879" dur="4.051">more information on there to what I</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="4.17">already had which was quite extensive in</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="5.01">terms of the arguments and the reasons</text>
  <text start="168.36" dur="5.52">against vaccines I&amp;#39;ve done videos on</text>
  <text start="170.94" dur="5.31">this in the past I&amp;#39;ve had expert you</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="5.689">know people who are involved in in the</text>
  <text start="176.25" dur="6.93">front and research of this kind of</text>
  <text start="179.569" dur="5.621">disease cancer the some of the things</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="5.25">that come with these vaccines like the</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="6.84">brain damage the autism rates things of</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="6.029">that nature so I&amp;#39;ve had experts on I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="192.03" dur="4.32">got a huge list of evidence is all there</text>
  <text start="194.459" dur="4.711">for people to see there&amp;#39;s really no</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="4.259">reason to deny it anymore even all the</text>
  <text start="199.17" dur="4.2">way up to Supreme Court cases I mean</text>
  <text start="200.609" dur="5.641">it&amp;#39;s all there right it&amp;#39;s a clear trail</text>
  <text start="203.37" dur="4.949">of corruption but some people still</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="3.959">choose to not see it they still choose</text>
  <text start="208.319" dur="3.631">look I&amp;#39;m going to just trust the doctor</text>
  <text start="210.209" dur="3.81">because I don&amp;#39;t want to live in that</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="3.78">world where people do bad things to each</text>
  <text start="214.019" dur="3.69">other it&amp;#39;s too hard for me to live in</text>
  <text start="215.73" dur="4.02">that world that seems to be what it</text>
  <text start="217.709" dur="4.951">comes down to I don&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s just kind of</text>
  <text start="219.75" dur="5.549">my personal theory on it I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="222.66" dur="5.729">for me I have quite a survival instinct</text>
  <text start="225.299" dur="4.711">and when someone tries to give me cancer</text>
  <text start="228.389" dur="4.201">my instinct is to throat punch them</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="5.729">right whereas some people&amp;#39;s instinct is</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="5.31">to just continue trusting the system no</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="3.661">matter how sick and this continues right</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="3.63">this continues all the way up to the</text>
  <text start="239.4" dur="5.85">deathbed with many people who who died</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="9.9">of some of these diseases so it is a</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="7.829">powerful and false faith anyway it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="5.459">like we&amp;#39;ve forgotten our human nature&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.079" dur="6.78">and we forgotten how people work because</text>
  <text start="256.889" dur="4.561">we have this fantasy system and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="259.859" dur="3.06">had it good for a while and we got kind</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="3">of complacent and lazy and now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="4.481">want to grow</text>
  <text start="264.45" dur="4.66">okay so from the new American here</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re actually reporting on sort of a</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="4.49">stealth bipartisan threat to gun rights</text>
  <text start="271.69" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s basically another one of these big</text>
  <text start="273.6" dur="5.92">red flag laws like we can take your gun</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="4.71">away from you based just on hearsay even</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="2.49">of potentially just like an enemy of</text>
  <text start="281.14" dur="4.62">yours saying that you&amp;#39;re dangerous</text>
  <text start="282.01" dur="5.4">whatever and this has a lot of</text>
  <text start="285.76" dur="4.11">Republicans signed onto it even more</text>
  <text start="287.41" dur="4.95">than Democrats so it&amp;#39;s at the House</text>
  <text start="289.87" dur="5.16">level you know just kind of something to</text>
  <text start="292.36" dur="4.41">keep an eye on obviously if they are</text>
  <text start="295.03" dur="3.72">trying great because this will just wake</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="4.2">up more people they&amp;#39;re not gonna succeed</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="4.29">with it but it will piss a lot of people</text>
  <text start="300.97" dur="4.2">off coming after the guns is one of the</text>
  <text start="303.04" dur="4.2">big no no&amp;#39;s i wish that they would do it</text>
  <text start="305.17" dur="3.78">just a little harder because we would</text>
  <text start="307.24" dur="4.71">just have more momentum behind what</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="5.25">we&amp;#39;re doing here with trump i imagine</text>
  <text start="311.95" dur="4.89">somewhere out there in in like the most</text>
  <text start="314.2" dur="5.01">remote hillbilly of places there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="3.75">guy who loves his guns and doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="319.21" dur="3.39">really particularly care about trump</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="4.05">probably not many of them left but</text>
  <text start="322.6" dur="5.18">somewhere right and he&amp;#39;s gonna get</text>
  <text start="324.64" dur="5.91">politically active at that point so</text>
  <text start="327.78" dur="4.45">anyway it&amp;#39;s kind of a funny image he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="330.55" dur="4.44">not there fishing and like a pond in the</text>
  <text start="332.23" dur="4.08">middle of the woods which sounds kind of</text>
  <text start="334.99" dur="6.42">nice actually just being out in the</text>
  <text start="336.31" dur="7.08">woods i like rural so we also have cohen</text>
  <text start="341.41" dur="4.29">michael cohen saying that mueller has</text>
  <text start="343.39" dur="4.11">substantial evidence against trump i</text>
  <text start="345.7" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t think so i think he&amp;#39;s just being</text>
  <text start="347.5" dur="6.59">leaned on i think he&amp;#39;s doing what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="350.53" dur="7.08">told kind of being a puppet on Muellers</text>
  <text start="354.09" dur="5.53">strings because he wants to get the best</text>
  <text start="357.61" dur="4.14">ill he can he got his three years he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="359.62" dur="5.07">probably get a lot of that reduced as</text>
  <text start="361.75" dur="4.98">well or whatever however the prison</text>
  <text start="364.69" dur="6.63">system works a lot of people get out</text>
  <text start="366.73" dur="6.689">early so he you know trying to throw</text>
  <text start="371.32" dur="6.42">shade on trump still no evidence but</text>
  <text start="373.419" dur="7.981">plenty of shade right there&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="377.74" dur="6.8">quote saying there&amp;#39;s no plan so GOP is</text>
  <text start="381.4" dur="5.46">apparently in turmoil over the shutdown</text>
  <text start="384.54" dur="5.43">Trump is of course stubborn he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="6.6">for the wall either way I see this as</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="4.9">sort of like he can&amp;#39;t back down now at</text>
  <text start="393.46" dur="2.82">the end of the year we have Q we have</text>
  <text start="394.87" dur="2.4">all of this stuff we have the Justice</text>
  <text start="396.28" dur="2.55">phase like there&amp;#39;s too much</text>
  <text start="397.27" dur="6.12">going on this is an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="398.83" dur="6.54">strike this is a time for chaos so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.39" dur="4.56">better to just dig in his heels and be</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="4.59">stubborn and come what may personally I</text>
  <text start="407.95" dur="3.09">would love to see hundreds of thousands</text>
  <text start="409.96" dur="4.56">of government federal government</text>
  <text start="411.04" dur="5.07">employees not paid because that is theft</text>
  <text start="414.52" dur="4.44">that is money that you stole from people</text>
  <text start="416.11" dur="6.48">through taxation to pay for your your</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="7.89">extra cushy and on unfairly favorable</text>
  <text start="422.59" dur="5.97">jobs as quote public servants you know</text>
  <text start="426.85" dur="3.06">no offense to people I just I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="428.56" dur="3.24">voluntary us I don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="429.91" dur="4.62">governments needed I think it&amp;#39;s immoral</text>
  <text start="431.8" dur="5.28">I think it&amp;#39;s force and you know Gandhi</text>
  <text start="434.53" dur="5.31">and many other famous folks have agreed</text>
  <text start="437.08" dur="4.14">with me the government is forced and and</text>
  <text start="439.84" dur="3.48">I think the founding fathers knew that</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="4.5">as well</text>
  <text start="443.32" dur="5.25">so of course they&amp;#39;re gonna fight this</text>
  <text start="445.72" dur="4.35">Chuck Schumer&amp;#39;s fighting it Pelosi&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.57" dur="3.81">fighting in there even acting kind of</text>
  <text start="450.07" dur="4.7">confident about it but Trump&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="452.38" dur="4.98">got the money through the government</text>
  <text start="454.77" dur="4.45">through the military funding so he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="457.36" dur="3.48">it it&amp;#39;s already a one thing I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="459.22" dur="4.02">why he&amp;#39;s even toying with them at this</text>
  <text start="460.84" dur="4.2">point maybe it&amp;#39;s just for the drama</text>
  <text start="463.24" dur="4.71">maybe it&amp;#39;s just for the trolls I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="465.04" dur="4.17">know so we also have some of the</text>
  <text start="467.95" dur="3.59">whistleblowers from the Clinton</text>
  <text start="469.21" dur="5.04">Foundation remember there were three</text>
  <text start="471.54" dur="4.54">operated there saying that the Clinton</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="4.5">Foundation operated outside of the</text>
  <text start="476.08" dur="4.23">bounds of nonprofit so they they are</text>
  <text start="478.75" dur="3.66">claiming that they brokered money in</text>
  <text start="480.31" dur="3.66">pharmaceuticals like my theory for a</text>
  <text start="482.41" dur="3.03">while now has kind of been that we were</text>
  <text start="483.97" dur="2.61">going to Al Capone the Clintons like</text>
  <text start="485.44" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;re not gonna take him down on the</text>
  <text start="486.58" dur="4.29">child trafficking and all of that maybe</text>
  <text start="488.65" dur="4.29">some of the treason but probably a lot</text>
  <text start="490.87" dur="3.27">of the the tax crimes and stuff because</text>
  <text start="492.94" dur="2.55">we know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re just blatantly</text>
  <text start="494.14" dur="4.38">violating these things they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="495.49" dur="4.95">usually get called on it but now that we</text>
  <text start="498.52" dur="3.45">have a good guy in power I mean these</text>
  <text start="500.44" dur="3.78">kind of options have opened up where we</text>
  <text start="501.97" dur="4.98">can just go after them for the tax thing</text>
  <text start="504.22" dur="4.59">lock them up for life and everyone will</text>
  <text start="506.95" dur="4.11">just kind of know what really went on</text>
  <text start="508.81" dur="4.2">behind the scenes if they choose to</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="3.6">which would be right in tune with what</text>
  <text start="513.01" dur="3.95">Kiev has been saying you you can choose</text>
  <text start="514.66" dur="6">to know the choice to know will be yours</text>
  <text start="516.96" dur="8.04">so they have plenty of normal crimes to</text>
  <text start="520.66" dur="6.99">go after as well I guess we also have</text>
  <text start="525" dur="4.36">this was funny this the body language I</text>
  <text start="527.65" dur="3.53">love the body language ghost Channel or</text>
  <text start="529.36" dur="3.56">formerly bombards body language really</text>
  <text start="531.18" dur="3.54">interesting takes on some of these</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="2.97">things and it was weird that pants</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="4.14">looked like he fell asleep in this</text>
  <text start="535.89" dur="7.07">meeting but her take her take on this</text>
  <text start="538.86" dur="6.27">Schumer and Pelosi situation was very</text>
  <text start="542.96" dur="4.54">restrained I mean they were basically</text>
  <text start="545.13" dur="4.14">being ambushed by surprise media during</text>
  <text start="547.5" dur="3.93">a normally what they would have expected</text>
  <text start="549.27" dur="4.35">to be a private sitting so you can tell</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="4.77">with Schumer&amp;#39;s body language like he is</text>
  <text start="553.62" dur="5.7">he is haunted right he has just walked</text>
  <text start="556.2" dur="5.88">over and Pelosi has this like a rigid</text>
  <text start="559.32" dur="4.829">body language fake smile thing going on</text>
  <text start="562.08" dur="4.53">anyway it was a pleasure to see I love</text>
  <text start="564.149" dur="6.721">seeing bad guys squirming I mean being</text>
  <text start="566.61" dur="6.63">made uncomfortable we also have a new</text>
  <text start="570.87" dur="5.58">legislation that could potentially pay</text>
  <text start="573.24" dur="6.81">make lawmakers pay their own sex crimes</text>
  <text start="576.45" dur="5.4">lawsuits which would be lovely and we</text>
  <text start="580.05" dur="3.24">should also have it mandated that those</text>
  <text start="581.85" dur="3.96">things are made public I mean that would</text>
  <text start="583.29" dur="4.53">help a little bit right it&amp;#39;s that whole</text>
  <text start="585.81" dur="4.08">moving within the realm of secrecy and</text>

  <text start="807.15" dur="6.09">obviously a little bit of an agenda hey</text>
  <text start="813.6" dur="8.08">this one was interesting I you know I</text>
  <text start="817.15" dur="6.21">hesitate to even get too excited about</text>
  <text start="821.68" dur="3.33">this kind of thing because Obamacare was</text>

  <text start="827.44" dur="4.71">exciting but what does that mean except</text>
  <text start="829.69" dur="6.21">for another year or two long fight in</text>
  <text start="832.15" dur="6.02">Appeals because this I mean and it will</text>
  <text start="835.9" dur="4.11">eventually be one I hope and I trust but</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="4.63">because it&amp;#39;s clearly unconstitutional</text>
  <text start="840.01" dur="3.84">but it&amp;#39;s gonna just be a long drawn-out</text>

  <text start="846.22" dur="3.66">appeal it and it&amp;#39;s gonna continue it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="847.75" dur="5.07">gonna stay in place until the appeals</text>
  <text start="849.88" dur="5.4">everything&amp;#39;s done so in effect nothing</text>
  <text start="852.82" dur="3.87">changes now but it is a good step it is</text>
  <text start="855.28" dur="4.44">a great step in the right direction</text>
  <text start="856.69" dur="6.81">Trump has retweeted it everything seems</text>
  <text start="859.72" dur="5.64">to be pretty good there so this article</text>
  <text start="863.5" dur="3.9">rod Rosenstein will not allow general</text>

  <text start="869.29" dur="3.72">willingness to defend Flynn so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="871.36" dur="3.63">really trying to keep this guy away from</text>

  <text start="879.31" dur="5.46">redacting it anyway so very strange very</text>
  <text start="882.97" dur="4.44">strange I wonder what he has to say that</text>
  <text start="884.77" dur="3.87">they don&amp;#39;t want us to know and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="887.41" dur="1.71">that we&amp;#39;ll find out sooner rather than</text>
  <text start="888.64" dur="3.78">later</text>
  <text start="889.12" dur="5.49">we also have a judge in the Flynn case</text>

  <text start="894.61" dur="5.49">documents after the bombshell claim of</text>

  <text start="900.1" dur="3.36">really going with miller&amp;#39;s BS in this</text>
  <text start="901.78" dur="4.41">case which is great i&amp;#39;m happy to see</text>
  <text start="903.46" dur="4.26">that the judge has been willing to push</text>
  <text start="906.19" dur="2.91">back against Mueller a little bit here</text>
  <text start="907.72" dur="5.01">and there I think it could have been a</text>
  <text start="909.1" dur="5.28">lot more given the circumstances but you</text>
  <text start="912.73" dur="3.18">know I&amp;#39;m glad to see the judges are</text>
  <text start="914.38" dur="4.89">willing to do that right usually it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="915.91" dur="4.65">just one corrupt you know crony person</text>

  <text start="922.39" dur="3.18">they&amp;#39;re all in the same team at the end</text>
  <text start="923.65" dur="5.01">of the day and there&amp;#39;s really no sort of</text>
  <text start="925.57" dur="5.44">justice out there most of the time</text>
  <text start="928.66" dur="3.85">but I guess when the two teams are</text>
  <text start="931.01" dur="3.36">fighting you know there&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="932.51" dur="4.2">more wiggle room in terms of justice but</text>
  <text start="934.37" dur="6.33">when it&amp;#39;s like one United monolith above</text>
  <text start="936.71" dur="5.64">you in terms of the power structure you</text>
  <text start="940.7" dur="3.63">know the nail just sort of work together</text>
  <text start="942.35" dur="5.43">to railroad you because they&amp;#39;re on the</text>

  <text start="981.98" dur="5.46">they got us after turning us into some</text>
  <text start="984.68" dur="4.44">sort of a war or civil war or cultural</text>
  <text start="987.44" dur="4.5">war or whatever it is they they screw</text>
  <text start="989.12" dur="5.04">things up usually pretty bad I&amp;#39;m a big</text>
  <text start="991.94" dur="3.57">fan of the free market to deal with</text>

  <text start="995.51" dur="5.67">power between people much better than on</text>
  <text start="998.86" dur="5.68">because even with it you know even when</text>
  <text start="1001.18" dur="5.73">you have a free market kind of and a</text>
  <text start="1004.54" dur="4.8">government inevitably that is that is a</text>

  <text start="1013.6" dur="3.71">eventually the government will exert its</text>

  <text start="1017.31" dur="5.53">you see things like today where the real</text>

  <text start="1043.66" dur="6.72">almost two-thirds of the licensing or I</text>
  <text start="1048.22" dur="3.27">think it&amp;#39;s third of the licensing jobs</text>

  <text start="1068.89" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s certainly not a capitalist system</text>
  <text start="1070.809" dur="3.961">and I just want to make people aware</text>
  <text start="1072.91" dur="3.12">that because to some degree you kind of</text>
  <text start="1074.77" dur="4.789">have to know a little bit of this</text>
  <text start="1076.03" dur="6.81">because this argument overall is largely</text>
