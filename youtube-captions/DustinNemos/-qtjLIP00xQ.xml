  <text start="15.1" dur="4.3">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="17.45" dur="5.97">most this is your daily mega and queue</text>
  <text start="19.4" dur="6.289">updates so I want to clarify I misspoke</text>
  <text start="23.42" dur="5.13">in one of my last videos I said</text>
  <text start="25.689" dur="4.93">WikiLeaks instead of Wikipedia where I</text>
  <text start="28.55" dur="4.17">was basically saying I hope this whole</text>
  <text start="30.619" dur="6.631">queue thing takes them down as well I</text>
  <text start="32.72" dur="6.03">like like a wiki leaks not Wikipedia and</text>
  <text start="37.25" dur="2.67">I&amp;#39;ve had that issue with Wikipedia for</text>
  <text start="38.75" dur="4.32">years and years I&amp;#39;m sure we all have</text>
  <text start="39.92" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;re basically a another source of</text>
  <text start="43.07" dur="3.66">disinfo it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s hard to actually fix</text>
  <text start="45.26" dur="3.72">things to tell the truth I&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="46.73" dur="4.02">immediately updates back to the the</text>
  <text start="48.98" dur="4.65">false narrative so the idea that</text>
  <text start="50.75" dur="4.98">everyone can go in and make a dish you</text>
  <text start="53.63" dur="5.75">know edits to the thing and additions</text>
  <text start="55.73" dur="5.49">and such is kind of bogus anyway but</text>
  <text start="59.38" dur="3.28">yeah I just wanted to put that out there</text>
  <text start="61.22" dur="3.149">a couple people are asking me like what</text>
  <text start="62.66" dur="3.63">do you like what do you hate WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="64.369" dur="5.191">for what&amp;#39;s going on do I not know</text>
  <text start="66.29" dur="6.6">something and speaking about WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="69.56" dur="6.239">so Facebook is now attaching wiki leak</text>
  <text start="72.89" dur="4.019">pages to Breitbart and and others this</text>
  <text start="75.799" dur="2.61">has been something they&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="76.909" dur="4.231">about for a while YouTube is talking</text>
  <text start="78.409" dur="4.291">about doing it so if you see a link from</text>
  <text start="81.14" dur="3.42">Breitbart chances are you&amp;#39;re gonna see a</text>
  <text start="82.7" dur="3.959">WikiLeaks pop-up that basically says</text>
  <text start="84.56" dur="6.57">that they intentionally and maliciously</text>
  <text start="86.659" dur="6.81">lie and spread disinformation so this is</text>
  <text start="91.13" dur="6.72">part of their you know trusted sources</text>
  <text start="93.469" dur="6.271">and and things like that obviously these</text>
  <text start="97.85" dur="4.979">big tech companies are going to sources</text>
  <text start="99.74" dur="5.61">like pull it a fact and Snopes to get</text>
  <text start="102.829" dur="4.89">their their fact-checking done which is</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="5.159">insane those are completely far-left</text>
  <text start="107.719" dur="4.71">organizations and and lie on a daily</text>
  <text start="110.509" dur="6.93">basis and have tons of scandals</text>
  <text start="112.429" dur="8.64">themselves it&amp;#39;s just the next step in</text>
  <text start="117.439" dur="6.06">the censorship it will allow them to be</text>
  <text start="121.069" dur="4.11">able to say well we didn&amp;#39;t ban them we</text>
  <text start="123.499" dur="4.171">didn&amp;#39;t block the free speech we just</text>
  <text start="125.179" dur="3.72">added a pop up that you know smelled of</text>
  <text start="127.67" dur="2.46">in some way you know you&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="128.899" dur="3.211">getting this with a lot of these things</text>
  <text start="130.13" dur="3.9">where the the image won&amp;#39;t show up on</text>
  <text start="132.11" dur="4.53">Twitter for example you have to click</text>
  <text start="134.03" dur="4.38">something and until you click this</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="3.42">button it just shows you know your your</text>
  <text start="138.41" dur="4.1">privacy settings or something may not</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="2.45">allow this</text>
  <text start="142.79" dur="3.479">even if I&amp;#39;ve tried to change it and I</text>
  <text start="144.62" dur="3.72">still can&amp;#39;t see images until I click the</text>
  <text start="146.269" dur="5.401">button from all of my favorite Twitter</text>
  <text start="148.34" dur="5.36">people and things like that it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="151.67" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s just really a dishonest</text>
  <text start="153.7" dur="3.94">manipulative thing of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="156.08" dur="3.81">gonna try to say this could potentially</text>
  <text start="157.64" dur="4.819">lead to viruses or things like that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="159.89" dur="5.28">had that on my youtube stuff before so</text>
  <text start="162.459" dur="4.81">it&amp;#39;s what they do it&amp;#39;s is part of the</text>
  <text start="165.17" dur="4.49">game it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just the nature of the</text>
  <text start="167.269" dur="7.05">war we&amp;#39;re in so don&amp;#39;t let it stop you</text>
  <text start="169.66" dur="6.49">now true pundit put out two different</text>
  <text start="174.319" dur="4.321">articles today and this is kind of to</text>
  <text start="176.15" dur="6.059">the ongoing culture war that I talk</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="5.909">about a lot CNN&amp;#39;s ratings suck basically</text>
  <text start="182.209" dur="4.5">is the short version and Trump&amp;#39;s ratings</text>
  <text start="184.549" dur="6.571">are up to 51% approval according to</text>
  <text start="186.709" dur="6.331">Rasmussen so you know just percentages</text>
  <text start="191.12" dur="5.149">at a time that&amp;#39;s how we win this thing</text>
  <text start="193.04" dur="5.699">it&amp;#39;s not gonna be all at once overnight</text>
  <text start="196.269" dur="5.47">in reality it seems to happen more like</text>
  <text start="198.739" dur="4.14">a like a staircase kind of levels off</text>
  <text start="201.739" dur="2.371">for a while we feel like nothing&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.879" dur="4.381">getting done and then something big</text>
  <text start="204.11" dur="4.68">happens and it just goes straight up but</text>
  <text start="207.26" dur="3">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the nature of this</text>
  <text start="208.79" dur="3.84">and we&amp;#39;re never gonna get everyone so</text>
  <text start="210.26" dur="4.699">it&amp;#39;s important to remember that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="212.63" dur="5.31">hoping for the majority of the minority</text>
  <text start="214.959" dur="4.271">and when I say that the minority is the</text>
  <text start="217.94" dur="3.03">few people in the world that actually</text>
  <text start="219.23" dur="3.3">care and pay attention to politics of</text>
  <text start="220.97" dur="3.54">those that&amp;#39;s where the battle is really</text>
  <text start="222.53" dur="5.519">raging the hottest there&amp;#39;s always gonna</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="5.759">be the majority of normies that just</text>
  <text start="228.049" dur="4.891">don&amp;#39;t care about politics and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.269" dur="4.381">unchangeable they&amp;#39;re so fluoridated and</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="4.35">vaccinated their brains are fried all</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="5.04">they can do is is watch TV and and work</text>
  <text start="237.29" dur="4.44">their their jobs and they&amp;#39;re just smart</text>
  <text start="239.69" dur="4.62">enough to do that so it&amp;#39;s kind of how</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="4.56">they always wanted it the elite one dumb</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="3.329">monkeys basically that are just smart</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="5.22">enough to work the machines and not</text>
  <text start="247.639" dur="7.32">smart enough to question anything now in</text>
  <text start="251.51" dur="7.83">response to the shooting in YouTube</text>
  <text start="254.959" dur="6.33">there is a comment from Donald Trump jr.</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="4.11">he says you think there&amp;#39;s any chance</text>
  <text start="261.289" dur="3.781">whatsoever that a mass shooters hateful</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="3.719">Instagram and YouTube channels would be</text>
  <text start="265.07" dur="4.89">pulled immediately if they were NRA</text>
  <text start="267.169" dur="5.671">members as opposed to liberal vegan PETA</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="5.13">activists this is a point that I&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="272.84" dur="4.579">as well recently they&amp;#39;re scrubbing</text>
  <text start="275.09" dur="6.45">internet of everything related to this</text>
  <text start="277.419" dur="5.921">girl I say that with a question because</text>
  <text start="281.54" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s rumors spreading that it was</text>
  <text start="283.34" dur="3.81">actually in transgender I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="285.62" dur="2.82">spreading them I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="3.87">include a link for you guys to read</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="4.08">below and you can kind of see the only</text>
  <text start="291.02" dur="3.75">information about that that I could find</text>
  <text start="292.52" dur="5.79">you can make up your own mind it&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="5.01">archived pedia type file it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="298.31" dur="5.609">Wikipedia it&amp;#39;s um one of the other ones</text>
  <text start="299.78" dur="6.419">but it&amp;#39;s it reads and suggests that she</text>
  <text start="303.919" dur="4.711">was actually born a man and had a sex</text>
  <text start="306.199" dur="4.53">change operation I don&amp;#39;t know obviously</text>
  <text start="308.63" dur="4.62">that would would be pretty bad for the</text>
  <text start="310.729" dur="4.711">narrative because the left sort of puts</text>
  <text start="313.25" dur="6.66">transgenderism atop every other category</text>
  <text start="315.44" dur="6.57">in the the victimology hierarchy you</text>
  <text start="319.91" dur="5.19">know it&amp;#39;s all about who can get the most</text>
  <text start="322.01" dur="6.24">victim points and well I guess the best</text>
  <text start="325.1" dur="7.53">that you could possibly be is a Muslim</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="5.9">black transgender woman if you get that</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="4.2">then you have scored the holy grail of</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="4.42">victimology and you get you get to</text>
  <text start="336.83" dur="4.67">basically be a queen and pretend that</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="2.93">you&amp;#39;re better than everyone because</text>
  <text start="341.979" dur="4">whatever reason they give you you know</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="4.049">I&amp;#39;m more of a victim than you are so</text>
  <text start="345.979" dur="3.961">therefore everything I say goes and you</text>
  <text start="348.139" dur="6.561">can&amp;#39;t argue with me it&amp;#39;s kind of how it</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="6.99">works right now conservative Tribune com</text>
  <text start="354.7" dur="5.23">put out an interesting article article</text>
  <text start="356.93" dur="7.73">if you&amp;#39;ve been following Kyle cash of</text>

  <text start="371.93" dur="5.25">students that have gone public and</text>
  <text start="373.4" dur="5.61">become a public face obviously the MSM</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="3.9">are parading their their chosen few</text>
  <text start="379.01" dur="3.75">children all over the internet and</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re getting increasingly violent</text>
  <text start="382.76" dur="5.55">increasingly fascist like in their</text>
  <text start="386.99" dur="3.179">rhetoric I&amp;#39;m not going to use that in</text>
  <text start="388.31" dur="3.57">word because they&amp;#39;ll surely ban me for</text>
  <text start="390.169" dur="3.631">that but you know they&amp;#39;ve got the</text>

  <text start="393.8" dur="6.51">got the the angry rhetoric they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="397.16" dur="5.64">the laying blame at the feet of people</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="3.93">that are not responsible like the NRA</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="3.209">you know they&amp;#39;re all murderers and</text>
  <text start="404.24" dur="3.239">they&amp;#39;re attacking us and they have blood</text>
  <text start="406.009" dur="3.271">on their faces that kind of comments</text>
  <text start="407.479" dur="6.571">these are the kind of comments that that</text>
  <text start="409.28" dur="6.78">lead to violence in the long run so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="3.42">very scary to see the left trying to</text>
  <text start="416.06" dur="3.419">push this kind of thing and they know</text>
  <text start="417.47" dur="4.08">where it ends they really do</text>
  <text start="419.479" dur="5.31">it ends with crazy lefties committing</text>

  <text start="456.68" dur="7.62">a psycho analyst psychoanalyze Kyle over</text>
  <text start="462.02" dur="3.84">the internet which is unethical to begin</text>
  <text start="464.3" dur="3.45">with they try doing that with Trump as</text>
  <text start="465.86" dur="3.929">well and then he sent this end to Ben</text>

  <text start="486.229" dur="4.861">this guy so it&amp;#39;s great to see that the</text>
  <text start="488.659" dur="4.141">whole you can&amp;#39;t attack the victims thing</text>
  <text start="491.09" dur="3.9">goes both ways now that we have our own</text>
  <text start="492.8" dur="3.39">victim he can deal with them because</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="3.299">they won&amp;#39;t debate him he&amp;#39;s gonna keep</text>
  <text start="496.19" dur="5.55">crushing them one on however many five</text>
  <text start="498.289" dur="5.731">that they have in terms of actual facts</text>
  <text start="501.74" dur="4.35">and such but they can&amp;#39;t attack him</text>
  <text start="504.02" dur="3.959">either even though many of them do</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="3.6">without seeing some consequences that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="507.979" dur="4.5">a wonderful thing I love seeing that</text>
  <text start="509.69" dur="4.709">sort of don&amp;#39;t attack the victim then use</text>
  <text start="512.479" dur="6.031">against them it&amp;#39;s beautiful it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.399" dur="7.231">karmic justice and back to that omnibus</text>
  <text start="518.51" dur="4.889">bill so when this happened and the</text>
  <text start="521.63" dur="3.24">omnibus bill passed conservatives were</text>
  <text start="523.399" dur="4.62">all off the Trump chain they were</text>
  <text start="524.87" dur="5.82">freaking out it was a big deal and</text>
  <text start="528.019" dur="4.43">pissed everyone off and and Ann Coulter</text>
  <text start="530.69" dur="5.1">and others basically abandoned Trump and</text>
  <text start="532.449" dur="3.911">you know we were saying at the time any</text>
  <text start="535.79" dur="3.27">of us and</text>
  <text start="536.36" dur="4.229">Media that it&amp;#39;s an omnibus not a budget</text>
  <text start="539.06" dur="2.73">there&amp;#39;s different roles Trump can</text>
  <text start="540.589" dur="4.021">basically do what he wants with an</text>
  <text start="541.79" dur="4.59">omnibus so the short version the</text>
  <text start="544.61" dur="3.599">impoundment Control Act allows the</text>
  <text start="546.38" dur="3.24">President to asked Congress to rescind</text>
  <text start="548.209" dur="3.87">funds that have been allocated in the</text>
  <text start="549.62" dur="3.99">budget Congress has not required to vote</text>
  <text start="552.079" dur="3.211">on the request but if they do agree to</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="3.51">vote it&amp;#39;s a simple majority in both</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="4.739">chambers and that&amp;#39;s all that is needed</text>
  <text start="557.12" dur="5.64">to approve cuts the president request so</text>
  <text start="560.029" dur="4.68">basically back to that the omnibus bill</text>
  <text start="562.76" dur="2.67">can be spent however he wants so even</text>
  <text start="564.709" dur="3.391">though there&amp;#39;s money in there for</text>
  <text start="565.43" dur="4.26">Planned Parenthood and he says hey</text>
  <text start="568.1" dur="3.27">Congress let&amp;#39;s vote on rescinding that</text>
  <text start="569.69" dur="3.03">they can do it with just a simple</text>
  <text start="571.37" dur="5.82">majority which the Republicans still</text>
  <text start="572.72" dur="7.79">hold barely and moving on worth</text>
  <text start="577.19" dur="5.19">mentioning there is an outbreak</text>

  <text start="1075.69" dur="4.829">move the National Guard down to the</text>
