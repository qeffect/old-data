  <text start="11.04" dur="5.069">good work thank you Alex for joining me</text>
  <text start="13.59" dur="3.72">I invited you because of the Roger stone</text>
  <text start="16.109" dur="3.42">thing I mean he was arrested in the</text>
  <text start="17.31" dur="4.469">middle of nights with CNN they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="19.529" dur="4.051">mysteriously on intuition somehow you</text>
  <text start="21.779" dur="3.42">know all these weird things happen there</text>
  <text start="23.58" dur="3.57">was already some scandals Mueller wanted</text>
  <text start="25.199" dur="4.021">to distract from you know I wanted to</text>
  <text start="27.15" dur="3.42">get your take I wanted to also ask her</text>
  <text start="29.22" dur="3.48">about a couple of other things just your</text>
  <text start="30.57" dur="5.31">thoughts about all of the events going</text>
  <text start="32.7" dur="4.35">on right now so let&amp;#39;s start there what</text>
  <text start="35.88" dur="3.749">do you what was your first thought with</text>
  <text start="37.05" dur="4.86">Roger all over TV of course everywhere</text>
  <text start="39.629" dur="4.11">that you&amp;#39;re stoned got arrested yeah</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="3.36">well thank you Destin for having me</text>
  <text start="43.739" dur="3.211">artists pleasure to be with you they for</text>
  <text start="45.27" dur="3.96">all that you&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;re the Roger</text>
  <text start="46.95" dur="4.08">stone case is really in my opinion very</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="5.52">bizarre I think there&amp;#39;s a few things</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="5.4">going on you know and I know Roger stone</text>
  <text start="54.75" dur="3.149">that I&amp;#39;ve you know gone to his house in</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="3.51">his office we&amp;#39;ve done some public</text>
  <text start="57.899" dur="3.3">interviews and he&amp;#39;s said some really</text>
  <text start="59.94" dur="2.91">incredible things you know one of the</text>
  <text start="61.199" dur="4.831">interviews you said he thought the deep</text>
  <text start="62.85" dur="4.92">state would plan to kill Trump if if</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="2.64">they couldn&amp;#39;t bring him down using</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="2.79">Mueller or</text>
  <text start="68.67" dur="4.71">calling him and saying or you know some</text>
  <text start="70.56" dur="6.36">other strategy like that and you know</text>
  <text start="73.38" dur="5.52">that&amp;#39;s made a terrifying idea but they</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="6.089">would go that far but I think Roger</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="5.16">stone is a threat to the deep stage you</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="3.211">know and you can think what you like</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="5.61">about his politics and his persona and</text>
  <text start="86.22" dur="5.49">you know his kind of is he understands</text>
  <text start="89.67" dur="4.739">how to torque the cameras I think he is</text>
  <text start="91.71" dur="4.019">it definitely a threat he does and it</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="3.991">you know he understood I think before</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="4.35">any of these people in Washington you</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="3.63">know these high-priced million dollar</text>
  <text start="100.079" dur="3">consultants all over the place that you</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="2.46">have charged a bunch of money to</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="3.72">political campaigns and just burned</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="4.559">through mostly he understood that the</text>
  <text start="106.799" dur="4.411">alternative media had become the new</text>
  <text start="109.049" dur="5.941">mainstream media long before anybody</text>
  <text start="111.21" dur="5.64">else so in the 2016 election Roger stone</text>
  <text start="114.99" dur="3.9">was out there making the connections and</text>
  <text start="116.85" dur="3.299">getting you know getting Trump promoted</text>
  <text start="118.89" dur="2.909">in the alternative media and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="120.149" dur="4.26">pushed him over the edge you know he he</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="3.631">got Trump Alex Jones you know now Alex</text>
  <text start="124.409" dur="2.131">Jones and you have developed a</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="2.579">relationship and you can think what you</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="2.76">like about Alex Jones but the fact is</text>
  <text start="128.009" dur="2.851">you&amp;#39;ve got millions of listeners and</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="2.85">those are millions of voters and those</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="2.67">are millions of people who will send</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="3.03">contribution</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="2.97">that was an offensive pushing more the</text>
  <text start="135.18" dur="2.85">engine you know getting the word out</text>
  <text start="136.5" dur="3.15">there on the alternative media that hey</text>
  <text start="138.03" dur="3.63">Trump is the real deal he&amp;#39;s not one of</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="4.11">these establishments to just so Roger</text>
  <text start="141.66" dur="4.71">stolen has an insight he understood this</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="5.1">long before the pundits did long before</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="4.47">the consultants did and in that sense he</text>
  <text start="148.86" dur="3.599">represents a real threat to their power</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="4.41">because they don&amp;#39;t necessarily control</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="4.171">him and I think that worries them so I</text>
  <text start="155.25" dur="3.93">think they really wanted to bring down</text>
  <text start="156.63" dur="4.98">Roger stone I think they really wanted</text>
  <text start="159.18" dur="4.08">to harm the alternative media and with</text>
  <text start="161.61" dur="4.379">Roger stone being very closely</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="5.28">associated with Infowars well you know I</text>
  <text start="165.989" dur="5.131">think that helps silence another conduit</text>
  <text start="168.54" dur="4.23">of information that gets out to a huge</text>
  <text start="171.12" dur="2.97">audience we need to be honest and</text>
  <text start="172.77" dur="3.03">recognize that this is a very</text>
  <text start="174.09" dur="3.42">significant political bloc the media</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="3.24">likes to pretend oh nobody listens to</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="3.72">Alex don&amp;#39;t love just a known as guys</text>
  <text start="179.04" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t listen plus right it&amp;#39;s huge it is</text>
  <text start="181.23" dur="3.78">huge I mean it&amp;#39;s broadcast all over the</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="3.99">country on AM FM radio</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="4.05">so even without the you know the social</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="4.53">media giants and still gets the word out</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="3.57">there and so that&amp;#39;s a threat to them and</text>
  <text start="191.67" dur="2.13">I think a couple of the other things</text>
  <text start="192.63" dur="3.66">that are going on Dustin</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="5.13">in my view because my understanding of</text>
  <text start="196.29" dur="5.13">what&amp;#39;s happening for one they really</text>
  <text start="198.93" dur="4.32">want to push this narrative of WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="201.42" dur="3.84">Russia and it&amp;#39;s a narrative that is</text>
  <text start="203.25" dur="3.51">completely built on lies you read the</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="3.87">New York Times or The Washington Post</text>
  <text start="206.76" dur="4.53">and they treat it as fact that the</text>
  <text start="209.13" dur="3.9">Russian attacked the emails from the DNC</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="3.39">and the John Podesta and the Hillary</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="4.08">Clinton and that they leaked it through</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="5.309">WikiLeaks now there&amp;#39;s absolutely no</text>
  <text start="217.11" dur="4.439">evidence for that none but the media</text>
  <text start="219.989" dur="3.03">took an indictment that was filed by</text>
  <text start="221.549" dur="2.851">Mueller against some Russians that</text>
  <text start="223.019" dur="3.301">obviously are never gonna be stepping</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="4.02">foot in a u.s. courtroom to rebut the</text>
  <text start="226.32" dur="3.93">charges I mean why would they how do</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="3.27">they know that the federal court system</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.17">is not exactly what we would call fair</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="5.22">and reliable one company that disliked</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="5.37">okay and will show up and we want anyway</text>
  <text start="236.91" dur="5.16">because you ain&amp;#39;t right into this whole</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="5.039">narrative that WikiLeaks was serving as</text>
  <text start="242.07" dur="4.889">a Kremlin stood is all based on this</text>
  <text start="244.829" dur="3.451">ridiculous indictment by Mueller that is</text>
  <text start="246.959" dur="2.971">never gonna have an opportunity to be</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="4.35">tested in court with a jury with a judge</text>
  <text start="249.93" dur="6.179">that you know an adversarial hearing and</text>
  <text start="252.63" dur="5.46">I just had like just and then I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="3.391">to interrupt but just all who want to</text>
  <text start="258.09" dur="1.98">understand the simplicity of this</text>
  <text start="259.5" dur="3.93">situation</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="5.82">imagine if every single like rapist or a</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="3.58">Salter or bad guy in Corps like just any</text>
  <text start="265.89" dur="3.73">thug all</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="5.25">Street there excuse every single time</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="4.38">was to divert the the whole thing back</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="3.03">and blame it on the victim every single</text>
  <text start="274" dur="3.78">and they get away with it every single</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="3.93">time or do any of this kind of same</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="3.42">tricks that they&amp;#39;re doing here</text>
  <text start="279.22" dur="4.23">you know planting something on someone</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="4.23">or saying that well this person said</text>
  <text start="283.45" dur="4.11">something bad that that&amp;#39;s true about me</text>
  <text start="285.43" dur="3.99">so therefore they&amp;#39;re working for some</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="4.11">other organization that is you know</text>
  <text start="289.42" dur="5.04">illegal or bad or whatever like this</text>
  <text start="291.67" dur="4.65">sort of I am immune to any sort of</text>
  <text start="294.46" dur="4.53">criticism therefore it&amp;#39;s always someone</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="4.44">else&amp;#39;s fault lash out attitude is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="298.99" dur="3.57">so obvious to me and I don&amp;#39;t see how</text>
  <text start="300.76" dur="3.72">others don&amp;#39;t get that but sorry to go</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="4.53">ahead yeah absolutely I agree with you</text>
  <text start="304.48" dur="4.32">entirely it is a giant fraud you know</text>
  <text start="307.09" dur="2.91">instead of talking about the content of</text>
  <text start="308.8" dur="2.34">these emails you know and I think we</text>
  <text start="310" dur="1.8">should be talking about the content</text>
  <text start="311.14" dur="2.37">disease you know these very</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="3.57">incriminating emails there&amp;#39;s all sorts</text>
  <text start="313.51" dur="3.48">of evidence of criminal activity you</text>
  <text start="315.37" dur="3.57">have evidence of just stuff it&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="4.17">being on people&amp;#39;s wildest imagination</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="4.11">you enjoying Podesta&amp;#39;s emails you have</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="4.11">and in Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s emails you have</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="4.29">stuff about spirit cooking you know with</text>
  <text start="325.27" dur="4.53">this weirdo or cult this movie marketer</text>
  <text start="327.34" dur="4.41">into yeah right I mean it&amp;#39;s just so</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="3.27">bizarre and so people need to look in as</text>
  <text start="331.75" dur="2.61">we covered it at the new American but</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="3.18">the mainstream media just completely</text>
  <text start="334.36" dur="3.42">ignored what was in the email said oh my</text>
  <text start="336.25" dur="3.45">goodness Russian hackers you know fake</text>
  <text start="337.78" dur="3.63">news to try to distract from what it was</text>
  <text start="339.7" dur="3.51">and you saw John Podesta gloating that</text>
  <text start="341.41" dur="3.75">Roger stone had been busted but again</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s absolutely no evidence that the</text>
  <text start="345.16" dur="3.81">Russians had anything to do with this in</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="5.01">fact in one of the public interviews we</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="3.93">did with Roger stone more than a year</text>
  <text start="351.64" dur="2.79">ago you know long before there was an</text>
  <text start="352.9" dur="4.2">indictment or anything like that he said</text>
  <text start="354.43" dur="3.75">most likely set rich did and that&amp;#39;s most</text>
  <text start="357.1" dur="2.52">likely what got him killed</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="3">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of evidence to suggest</text>
  <text start="359.62" dur="3.45">that either the speed at which this</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="3.66">stuff was was taken off of the system</text>
  <text start="363.07" dur="3.75">that was absolute truth yeah exactly</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="3.45">could it must have come from someone</text>
  <text start="366.82" dur="4.11">within the inside it wasn&amp;#39;t a hacker</text>
  <text start="368.29" dur="4.38">sitting in Moscow or st. Petersburg bill</text>
  <text start="370.93" dur="4.89">Binney right they told us time the</text>
  <text start="372.67" dur="4.56">exactly yeah and so there&amp;#39;s all this</text>
  <text start="375.82" dur="3.24">evidence that showed that the whole</text>
  <text start="377.23" dur="3.27">narrative with the WikiLeaks is a lie</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="2.79">you know I have a few concerns about</text>
  <text start="380.5" dur="3.18">WikiLeaks but what they put out is</text>
  <text start="381.85" dur="3.15">honest it&amp;#39;s reliable its actual stuff</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="2.46">you know they&amp;#39;re not mean I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="385" dur="2.58">concerned about what they&amp;#39;re putting out</text>

  <text start="658.43" dur="3.6">graces of the swamp to be able to</text>
  <text start="660.47" dur="3.18">continue making a living and I think</text>
  <text start="662.03" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on to us I would say</text>
  <text start="663.65" dur="3.27">that if you have a lot to lose it would</text>
  <text start="665.12" dur="2.43">be pretty scary yeah absolutely</text>

  <text start="669.92" dur="4.47">you can&amp;#39;t really take anything from me</text>
  <text start="671.86" dur="3.82">yeah I can definitely see that</text>
  <text start="674.39" dur="2.61">especially if you like you&amp;#39;re an older</text>
  <text start="675.68" dur="2.76">position and then you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="677" dur="3.36">everything ruined to take it from you</text>
  <text start="678.44" dur="4.35">like look at phlegm needs these ruined</text>
  <text start="680.36" dur="3.93">yeah I mean he lost his job yet you know</text>
  <text start="682.79" dur="3.51">ended up having his life turned upside</text>
  <text start="684.29" dur="3.36">down you know if you have kids out there</text>
  <text start="686.3" dur="3.39">you know what you want your kids to come</text>

  <text start="697.97" dur="2.79">kids don&amp;#39;t end up out on the street and</text>
  <text start="699.41" dur="2.64">I think that&amp;#39;s part of it you know I</text>
  <text start="700.76" dur="4.29">think we&amp;#39;re dealing with psychological</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="4.5">warfare here and what I think is so</text>
  <text start="705.05" dur="3.9">interesting if you look at this</text>
  <text start="706.55" dur="4.59">indictment against Roger stone all it</text>
  <text start="708.95" dur="3.96">does is further discredit them right</text>
  <text start="711.14" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s nothing in there not a word in</text>
  <text start="712.91" dur="4.04">there about Russia collusion there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="714.8" dur="4.05">a word in there about you know</text>
  <text start="716.95" dur="3.16">collaborating with the Kremlin aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="718.85" dur="3.87">putting trumpet on it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of</text>
  <text start="720.11" dur="4.2">process I know Roger he&amp;#39;s probably going</text>
  <text start="722.72" dur="3.78">to crush it too I mean he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="724.31" dur="4.71">destroy it in the public image at least</text>
  <text start="726.5" dur="5.13">probably yeah yeah he&amp;#39;s smarter than</text>
  <text start="729.02" dur="4.23">them and he&amp;#39;s better at at working me</text>
  <text start="731.63" dur="3.81">straight so I think that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="733.25" dur="3.63">threat to them and Donald Trump to you</text>
  <text start="735.44" dur="3.78">know they&amp;#39;re not used to dealing with</text>
  <text start="736.88" dur="5.61">people who can outwit them at their own</text>
  <text start="739.22" dur="5.28">games and it&amp;#39;s an interesting situation</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="4.86">so I&amp;#39;m looking forward to see how this</text>
  <text start="744.5" dur="5.13">develops mega plans right now to go</text>
  <text start="747.35" dur="3.99">interview Roger stone again very very</text>
  <text start="749.63" dur="2.88">shortly and so hopefully we&amp;#39;ll have more</text>
  <text start="751.34" dur="2.67">on that and in the meantime if could</text>
  <text start="752.51" dur="2.97">want to go see some of what he&amp;#39;s told us</text>
  <text start="754.01" dur="3.21">you know we put a lot of those</text>
  <text start="755.48" dur="4.17">interviews up on YouTube we wrote about</text>
  <text start="757.22" dur="4.32">them the new American magazine new book</text>
  <text start="759.65" dur="3.51">kind of what he says without the filter</text>
  <text start="761.54" dur="3.69">of the mainstream media you can see what</text>
  <text start="763.16" dur="3.3">he&amp;#39;s trying to say whereas the media</text>
  <text start="765.23" dur="2.91">won&amp;#39;t tell you what he&amp;#39;s actually saying</text>
  <text start="766.46" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;ll just show you pictures of people</text>
  <text start="768.14" dur="3.72">standing outside the courthouse ain&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="769.58" dur="4.86">jail Roger stone you know more fake news</text>
  <text start="771.86" dur="4.41">so do you believe they tried do you</text>
  <text start="774.44" dur="3.03">remember back during the campaign when</text>
  <text start="776.27" dur="2.61">they tried to like take him out do you</text>
  <text start="777.47" dur="4.05">believe they really did try to take him</text>
  <text start="778.88" dur="4.89">out who Roger stone yeah</text>
  <text start="781.52" dur="3.3">I think he was poisoned and then think</text>
  <text start="783.77" dur="1.29">they tried to hit him with a car too</text>
  <text start="784.82" dur="2.55">right</text>
  <text start="785.06" dur="5.49">you know I&amp;#39;ve heard those things I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="787.37" dur="4.83">know he was really sick for a while he</text>
  <text start="790.55" dur="4.68">almost didn&amp;#39;t make it to the celebration</text>
  <text start="792.2" dur="4.44">so that was one of those weird moments</text>
  <text start="795.23" dur="3.4">where you&amp;#39;re you start to think maybe</text>
  <text start="796.64" dur="4.27">this stuff is actually going on</text>
  <text start="798.63" dur="4.59">yeah well he&amp;#39;s a loose cannon and you</text>
  <text start="800.91" dur="3.87">know he understands how the media works</text>
  <text start="803.22" dur="3.69">he understands how to manipulate the</text>
  <text start="804.78" dur="3.78">media and how to get people like you</text>
  <text start="806.91" dur="3.69">know he&amp;#39;s worked on what three or four</text>
  <text start="808.56" dur="4.86">successful presidential campaigns I mean</text>
  <text start="810.6" dur="4.62">the guy knows how to work the system and</text>
  <text start="813.42" dur="3.84">you know you obviously get dirty when</text>
  <text start="815.22" dur="3.9">you when you work in that kind of system</text>
  <text start="817.26" dur="3.39">but he knows how to work it and so</text>
  <text start="819.12" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s such a big thing if he</text>
  <text start="820.65" dur="4.98">can&amp;#39;t be brought to their side if they</text>
  <text start="822.57" dur="4.32">can&amp;#39;t use his talents for advancing</text>
  <text start="825.63" dur="3">their own agenda then he becomes a</text>
  <text start="826.89" dur="6.14">threat he becomes a loose cannon and it</text>
  <text start="828.63" dur="6.63">helps to neutralize him so well</text>
  <text start="833.03" dur="3.67">hopefully things will turn out I you</text>
  <text start="835.26" dur="5.04">know I think this is going to be at</text>
  <text start="836.7" dur="5.91">least comedic gold probably at best a</text>
  <text start="840.3" dur="6">distraction but I do imagine Rogers</text>
  <text start="842.61" dur="5.34">gonna hold his own and honestly I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="846.3" dur="3.93">see this Russian thing going too much</text>
  <text start="847.95" dur="3.75">further who knows but I wanted to switch</text>
  <text start="850.23" dur="3.63">it up just one second and this question</text>
  <text start="851.7" dur="3.84">has been on my mind I support Trump but</text>
  <text start="853.86" dur="5.79">sometimes I do feel like maybe he makes</text>
  <text start="855.54" dur="5.88">mistakes when he declared a different</text>
  <text start="859.65" dur="4.86">person who didn&amp;#39;t even run for president</text>
  <text start="861.42" dur="5.61">the president of Venezuela I feel like</text>
  <text start="864.51" dur="5.07">he left himself open for the same thing</text>
  <text start="867.03" dur="4.52">to be done unilaterally just by everyone</text>
  <text start="869.58" dur="4.32">that hates us across the world right now</text>
  <text start="871.55" dur="4.33">and it&amp;#39;s a very interesting point and</text>
  <text start="873.9" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;ve had the same concern in fact um if</text>
  <text start="875.88" dur="3.63">you look at what happened in Venezuela</text>
  <text start="876.99" dur="4.05">you could make a similar analogy you</text>
  <text start="879.51" dur="3.12">know what if Congress what if the</text>
  <text start="881.04" dur="3.45">Democratic Congress said Trump is not</text>
  <text start="882.63" dur="4.2">the legitimate president we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="884.49" dur="5.04">make Nancy Pelosi the president and then</text>
  <text start="886.83" dur="4.53">you know the European governments and</text>
  <text start="889.53" dur="3.33">the Latin American governments at China</text>
  <text start="891.36" dur="2.85">said oh yeah well we recognized the new</text>
  <text start="892.86" dur="4.05">interim president because that&amp;#39;s clearly</text>
  <text start="894.21" dur="4.68">insane and you know the Congress voted</text>
  <text start="896.91" dur="3.12">for it says but at the same time you</text>
  <text start="898.89" dur="2.73">know I think it&amp;#39;s a really interesting</text>
  <text start="900.03" dur="3.3">issue my position has always been</text>
  <text start="901.62" dur="3.66">similar to Ron Paul&amp;#39;s we ought to stay</text>
  <text start="903.33" dur="4.74">out of foreign governments business yeah</text>
  <text start="905.28" dur="4.41">and we are not mentally he affairs of</text>
  <text start="908.07" dur="4.98">other nations it&amp;#39;s just not the role of</text>
  <text start="909.69" dur="5.07">the US government but with that said you</text>
  <text start="913.05" dur="5.28">know Maduro was a gangster and a</text>
  <text start="914.76" dur="5.25">dictator and the I would argue that the</text>
  <text start="918.33" dur="3.27">elections there have absolutely no</text>
  <text start="920.01" dur="3.42">legitimacy the presidential elections</text>
  <text start="921.6" dur="4.53">there are a complete and total fraud and</text>
  <text start="923.43" dur="4.65">so if the National Assembly says you</text>
  <text start="926.13" dur="4.08">know it would be very similar I think in</text>
  <text start="928.08" dur="3.78">another sense you know to frame it a</text>
  <text start="930.21" dur="4.059">different way what if our con</text>
  <text start="931.86" dur="4.839">impeach the president what if the Senate</text>
  <text start="934.269" dur="4.891">approved that impeachment and convicted</text>
  <text start="936.699" dur="3.93">and then you know Trump said well hey</text>
  <text start="939.16" dur="3.63">you know what I&amp;#39;m just gonna remain in</text>
  <text start="940.629" dur="3.63">power forever unison say Obama I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="942.79" dur="2.849">gonna remain in power forever then other</text>
  <text start="944.259" dur="2.611">governments would be justified that they</text>
  <text start="945.639" dur="3">you could say well you know your own</text>
  <text start="946.87" dur="2.909">Constitution says this is how things</text>

  <text start="1113.83" dur="4.5">always concerned when there&amp;#39;s any hint</text>
  <text start="1115.69" dur="4.83">of US intervention I heard just recently</text>

  <text start="1140.95" dur="3.81">no business being able I would agree I</text>

  <text start="1149.02" dur="4.95">and they&amp;#39;re pushing for it and I think</text>
  <text start="1151.539" dur="3.961">that it&amp;#39;s fair criticism even though we</text>
  <text start="1153.97" dur="3.089">support romp to two point these things</text>
  <text start="1155.5" dur="3.21">out when we disagree with him on this</text>

  <text start="1167.35" dur="4.319">said much about Venezuela publicly just</text>
  <text start="1169.24" dur="4.35">because it you know it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1171.669" dur="3.901">hard to do exactly what&amp;#39;s going on I</text>
  <text start="1173.59" dur="3.48">sympathize tremendously with the people</text>
  <text start="1175.57" dur="3.359">of Venezuela and I fully support any</text>
  <text start="1177.07" dur="4.14">efforts they take to liberate themselves</text>
  <text start="1178.929" dur="5.88">from this yeah same here I encourage</text>
  <text start="1181.21" dur="4.74">that if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s organic Jim and you</text>
  <text start="1184.809" dur="2.431">know to the extent that the US</text>
  <text start="1185.95" dur="2.969">government gets involved in things all</text>
  <text start="1187.24" dur="3.03">they do is discredit Billis movements</text>
  <text start="1188.919" dur="3.841">you know so get to the fact that Trump</text>
  <text start="1190.27" dur="3.81">is perceived as backing an uprising that</text>
  <text start="1192.76" dur="3">serves the disc red that gives</text>

  <text start="1206.18" dur="4.86">happen that&amp;#39;s my view of course so it</text>
  <text start="1209.48" dur="3.15">always makes you wonder if there&amp;#39;s if</text>
  <text start="1211.04" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s a little bit more of a conflict</text>

  <text start="1751.98" dur="3.72">this is going to always happen with a</text>
  <text start="1754.289" dur="3.36">government that has this kind of</text>
  <text start="1755.7" dur="4.53">capability and power it will always</text>
  <text start="1757.649" dur="3.961">abuse it no question so we should try to</text>

  <text start="1783.6" dur="4.77">some influence there or problem is in</text>
  <text start="1785.85" dur="4.47">people&amp;#39;s belief that we need this yeah</text>
  <text start="1788.37" dur="3.149">and if we would obey the Constitution so</text>
  <text start="1790.32" dur="3.54">many of these problems would disappear</text>
  <text start="1791.519" dur="3.571">you know so many of these agencies would</text>
  <text start="1793.86" dur="4.11">disappear and they wouldn&amp;#39;t be there to</text>
  <text start="1795.09" dur="4.589">be abused yeah you were back in the day</text>

  <text start="1806.25" dur="2.429">be privatized you know you know be</text>
  <text start="1807.63" dur="2.97">different in the founders right now we</text>
  <text start="1808.679" dur="3.271">could privatize the folks we could go</text>
  <text start="1810.6" dur="3.36">our whole life without ever meeting a</text>
  <text start="1811.95" dur="3.63">Fed and that would be nice if we could</text>
  <text start="1813.96" dur="3.63">take the be you know that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="1815.58" dur="3.449">example the post office versus the you</text>
  <text start="1817.59" dur="4.65">you know any of these alternative</text>
  <text start="1819.029" dur="5.821">free-market alternatives like FedEx they</text>
  <text start="1822.24" dur="4.35">are so much better that they even force</text>
  <text start="1824.85" dur="3.949">the government to do a better job you</text>
  <text start="1826.59" dur="3.959">know we can do that on every single</text>
  <text start="1828.799" dur="3.671">everything that you think the government</text>
  <text start="1830.549" dur="4.411">is needed for the roads you&amp;#39;d get better</text>
  <text start="1832.47" dur="5.04">cheaper faster roads perhaps everything</text>
  <text start="1834.96" dur="5.699">so even in law enforcement and all of</text>
