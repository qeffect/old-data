  <text start="1.19" dur="6.76">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.81" dur="5.43">most of destiny most calm now I have a</text>
  <text start="7.95" dur="3.809">couple of short short things to talk</text>
  <text start="9.24" dur="5.12">about basically I want to address it</text>
  <text start="11.759" dur="4.591">what seems to be the strongest anti Q</text>
  <text start="14.36" dur="3.64">deception that&amp;#39;s going around right now</text>
  <text start="16.35" dur="3.3">because this is the one that people seem</text>
  <text start="18" dur="4.17">to just keep coming back to when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="19.65" dur="6">trying to disprove a debunk Q and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="5.099">they&amp;#39;re strongly aha we have proof so</text>
  <text start="25.65" dur="3.93">real thick very briefly it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="27.269" dur="5.7">pamphlet issue pamphlet anon is one of</text>
  <text start="29.58" dur="6.51">the the bakers or the leaders of the Q</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="4.891">movement but by certainly by no means is</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="3.989">he the only one and it&amp;#39;s a decentralized</text>
  <text start="37.86" dur="4.8">movement many of you would know pamphlet</text>
  <text start="40.079" dur="5.16">primarily from the 24/7 live stream in</text>
  <text start="42.66" dur="4.77">which case he has stepped out of being</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="5.811">in an on and has shown his face and his</text>
  <text start="47.43" dur="6.359">his I think his wife or girlfriend and</text>
  <text start="51.05" dur="4.87">also you know his name I think he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="53.789" dur="5.34">there so he&amp;#39;s no longer in and on much</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="5.49">like myself but will still you know we</text>
  <text start="59.129" dur="3.691">out of respect you know as we started I</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="1.77">still refer to people like that isn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="62.82" dur="3.27">nun</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="5.28">anyway pamphlet isn&amp;#39;t a non pamphlet is</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="4.889">sort of a leader among the nuns and it</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="3.87">is natural that when an anti cute</text>
  <text start="70.979" dur="3.96">criticism comes out it&amp;#39;s gonna be at the</text>
  <text start="72.33" dur="4.26">leadership that&amp;#39;s exposed because</text>
  <text start="74.939" dur="4.081">remember it&amp;#39;s about attacking the people</text>
  <text start="76.59" dur="6.15">not the arguments at hominem it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="79.02" dur="5.099">about the man against the man and and</text>
  <text start="82.74" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s really what it comes down to Lee</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="5.07">you can&amp;#39;t believe in Q if this guy is</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="3.63">just some loser jerk who makes stuff up</text>
  <text start="89.189" dur="2.881">on the internet so they&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="90.24" dur="3.54">attack pamphlet and try to attack his</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="5.1">character and everything else but the</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="5.519">the the fact that they cling to as proof</text>
  <text start="97.17" dur="5.01">and as evidence let me address this once</text>
  <text start="99.299" dur="4.921">again very quickly all right at one</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="3.54">point and this has happened in the past</text>
  <text start="104.22" dur="3.57">so there&amp;#39;s context here they always</text>
  <text start="105.72" dur="4.02">leave that out who has multiple times</text>
  <text start="107.79" dur="3.75">revealed his password but at one point</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="4.65">he revealed his password alright</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="6.869">pamphlet was actually in a 24/7</text>
  <text start="114.39" dur="6.689">livestream on the video at the time and</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="4.32">he noticed it and signed him voila</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="3.601">oh no we&amp;#39;ve got you we&amp;#39;ve got you your</text>
  <text start="122.729" dur="4.651">cue and on what did you do how did you</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="5.189">know well he knew because of context and</text>
  <text start="127.38" dur="4.68">experience like many of us when Hugh</text>
  <text start="129.869" dur="3.891">dropped his password it was obvious and</text>
  <text start="132.06" dur="3.41">in fact it was so obvious that</text>
  <text start="133.76" dur="4.02">dozens and dozens and dozens I watched</text>
  <text start="135.47" dur="3.51">this happen if not hundreds because I</text>
  <text start="137.78" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t watched the whole thing he just</text>
  <text start="138.98" dur="5.97">kept going people logged into to the the</text>
  <text start="142.28" dur="4.11">queue trip code and started posting they</text>
  <text start="144.95" dur="5.49">started saying things like what&amp;#39;s up or</text>
  <text start="146.39" dur="6">lol or Mar poor hahahahaha I hacked Q</text>
  <text start="150.44" dur="3.09">and his stupid stuff right and some of</text>
  <text start="152.39" dur="3.3">them are like what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="153.53" dur="5.069">what happened Q question you know things</text>
  <text start="155.69" dur="4.95">like that but if you listen to the</text>
  <text start="158.599" dur="4.23">detractors it&amp;#39;s gonna be absolute</text>
  <text start="160.64" dur="4.769">unequivocal were proof that they have</text>
  <text start="162.829" dur="5.011">caught pamphlet s q and on right and</text>
  <text start="165.409" dur="4.021">they will not address the arguments for</text>
  <text start="167.84" dur="3.84">Q&amp;#39;s existence they will not address the</text>
  <text start="169.43" dur="4.05">hundred plus points of evidence and the</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="3.99">Q incidences that continue to happen</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="6.649">that defile all the potential</text>
  <text start="175.67" dur="4.459">mathematical odds and probability I mean</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="5.23">anyway so I just wanted to kind of get</text>
  <text start="184.069" dur="3.691">that out there because this one single</text>
  <text start="185.48" dur="4.979">argument is about 90% of the anti Q</text>
  <text start="187.76" dur="4.5">stuff out there seems as for the rest</text>
  <text start="190.459" dur="3.09">stay tuned because there will be a</text>
  <text start="192.26" dur="4.47">debate coming up soon</text>
  <text start="193.549" dur="4.861">I am waiting hear back from the second</text>
  <text start="196.73" dur="3.869">of the two that I&amp;#39;m debating as to</text>
  <text start="198.41" dur="5.07">whether or not they will accept my</text>
  <text start="200.599" dur="4.051">suggestion as moderator yeah I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="203.48" dur="3.33">really particularly care who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="204.65" dur="3.869">moderator because no offense to whoever</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="3.209">gets the job it&amp;#39;s a trained monkey could</text>
  <text start="208.519" dur="4.351">do it you just have to keep crosstalk</text>
  <text start="210.019" dur="4.56">down you know kind of keep X amount of</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="3.78">minutes per each side that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="214.579" dur="4.321">not exactly a complicated job not</text>
  <text start="216.65" dur="4.769">exactly a job even an unbiased person or</text>
  <text start="218.9" dur="5.13">even a biased person could not do but I</text>
  <text start="221.419" dur="4.891">suggested Titus frost he is anti Q but I</text>
  <text start="224.03" dur="4.289">trust him enough to to tell the true</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="3.929">stuff F I think he has a good character</text>
  <text start="228.319" dur="4.23">and he covers things like pizza gate and</text>
  <text start="230.239" dur="4.231">pita gate as well he doubts Q I think</text>
  <text start="232.549" dur="3.481">his position is somewhere you know we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="234.47" dur="2.79">briefly mentioned and talked about</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="4.109">enough kind of asked him a little bit</text>
  <text start="237.26" dur="6.99">but I think his physician is more that Q</text>
  <text start="240.139" dur="5.671">is a disinfectant</text>
  <text start="244.25" dur="3.93">I almost ly I don&amp;#39;t know Titus I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="3.84">want it I don&amp;#39;t want to try to get his</text>
  <text start="248.18" dur="4.889">position out there I don&amp;#39;t know his</text>
  <text start="249.65" dur="7.44">position that well so but I think that</text>
  <text start="253.069" dur="6.63">that is a fairly strong mod option that</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="4.889">is anti Q to begin with so I have I have</text>
  <text start="259.699" dur="4.141">nothing to gain by suggesting him and I</text>
  <text start="261.979" dur="4.611">have everything to lose in the debate by</text>
  <text start="263.84" dur="4.37">suggesting him so assuming that my</text>
  <text start="266.59" dur="4.17">other opponents are intellectually</text>
  <text start="268.21" dur="6.78">honest I think that we will soon have an</text>
  <text start="270.76" dur="6.3">agreed-upon mod and Isaac is already I</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="4.8">think agreed to it he just kind of said</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="3.87">something like whatever so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="279.79" dur="3.3">remember their quote but it was</text>
  <text start="280.93" dur="4.38">something like I&amp;#39;m good bro or something</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m assuming that&amp;#39;s an acceptance or yes</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="2.85">but in the context you know he could</text>
  <text start="287.11" dur="3.66">have just been back and out of that I</text>
  <text start="288.16" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;ll see I&amp;#39;m gonna start</text>
  <text start="290.77" dur="3.72">doing my notes anyway because I need to</text>
  <text start="292.57" dur="3.78">rebuild my list of cue proofs I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="3.989">slacking because they&amp;#39;re so darn many</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="4.56">people are like how can&amp;#39;t you debate</text>
  <text start="298.479" dur="3.931">just off the top of your head why do you</text>
  <text start="300.91" dur="2.94">need time to get notes together because</text>
  <text start="302.41" dur="3.75">I can&amp;#39;t remember all of the proofs</text>
  <text start="303.85" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s just how complicated and how</text>
  <text start="306.16" dur="3.9">extensive it is and when this debate</text>
  <text start="308.74" dur="3.96">happens they have the unenviable</text>
  <text start="310.06" dur="5.88">position to not only debate me on the</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="4.98">cue proofs okay it&amp;#39;s not gonna be hey</text>
  <text start="315.94" dur="2.94">this thing here what do you think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.68" dur="2.28">gonna be hey this thing here what do you</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="2.28">think hey this thing here what do you</text>
  <text start="319.96" dur="3.12">think and it&amp;#39;s gonna be all of them</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="3.24">alright and this is different because</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;re not debating one thing that you</text>
  <text start="324.4" dur="4.86">could pick apart you&amp;#39;re debating all of</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="5.19">them together with with full you know</text>
  <text start="329.26" dur="4.05">context and leaning on each other as</text>
  <text start="331.45" dur="5.12">proof all right and when you look at it</text>
  <text start="333.31" dur="5.64">like that you cannot deny cue period and</text>
  <text start="336.57" dur="5.469">my hope is that people will be able to</text>
  <text start="338.95" dur="5.67">use this debate video in the future when</text>
  <text start="342.039" dur="5.701">they are faced with cue doubters or too</text>
  <text start="344.62" dur="5.16">much Hilary going on I think we can go</text>
  <text start="347.74" dur="3.299">back to this and learn a lesson I think</text>
  <text start="349.78" dur="5.25">this video will hopefully serve the</text>
  <text start="351.039" dur="6.75">community and get more eyes on cue that</text>
  <text start="355.03" dur="4.41">said I think that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to go</text>
  <text start="357.789" dur="3.63">through today basically I&amp;#39;m working on</text>
  <text start="359.44" dur="4.17">my news videos and I still see more and</text>
  <text start="361.419" dur="4.231">more and more comments and things like</text>
  <text start="363.61" dur="4.71">that trying to attack you and it always</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="6.09">comes back to the pamphlet things so now</text>
  <text start="368.32" dur="5.61">that you understand the deceptive nature</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="3.87">of this right and some people know</text>
  <text start="373.93" dur="3.33">better than this okay they have the</text>
  <text start="375.61" dur="4.59">context and they still choose to tell</text>
  <text start="377.26" dur="4.71">these lines and that is why I have come</text>
  <text start="380.2" dur="4.74">out pretty hard lately against people</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="5.48">who are who are spreading certain things</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="5.159">that they know better right</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="7.63">you know I&amp;#39;ve caught some flak from</text>
  <text start="390.099" dur="6.421">abandoning former friends for that so if</text>
  <text start="395.08" dur="4.009">you&amp;#39;re paying attention you know I have</text>
  <text start="396.52" dur="5.189">to go where the truth takes me I cannot</text>
  <text start="399.089" dur="4.48">and I cannot continue to ignore someone</text>
  <text start="401.709" dur="4.32">for attacking he went on with malicious</text>
  <text start="403.569" dur="4.35">lies who was spreading this info and in</text>
  <text start="406.029" dur="3.87">creating you know I didn&amp;#39;t with Alex</text>
  <text start="407.919" dur="3.57">Jones despite I mean I would have taken</text>
  <text start="409.899" dur="2.91">a bullet for Alex Jones folks I probably</text>
  <text start="411.489" dur="3.21">still would because I think he does a</text>
  <text start="412.809" dur="4.08">lot of good for the for the planet but</text>
  <text start="414.699" dur="3.72">when he&amp;#39;s wrong I call him when Trump</text>
  <text start="416.889" dur="3.72">and Q have done things wrong I&amp;#39;ve called</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="6.09">that I did not like the way Q attacked</text>
  <text start="420.609" dur="5.34">Alex Jones for his performance artist</text>
  <text start="424.509" dur="2.76">thing in court like I&amp;#39;ve defended Alex</text>
  <text start="425.949" dur="2.76">on that for years and years and years</text>
  <text start="427.269" dur="3.36">because the media just used it to like</text>
  <text start="428.709" dur="4.65">to lie they&amp;#39;d used the truth to tell a</text>
  <text start="430.629" dur="3.93">lie he was not a performance artist he</text>
  <text start="433.359" dur="3.66">did not admit to being a performance</text>
  <text start="434.559" dur="3.78">artist 100% of a show he admitted to</text>
  <text start="437.019" dur="3.03">being a performance artist when he drew</text>
  <text start="438.339" dur="3.29">dressed up like the Joker and said less</text>
  <text start="440.049" dur="4.77">Florida even kill all the kids obviously</text>
  <text start="441.629" dur="5.11">folks using lies to tell the truth is</text>
  <text start="444.819" dur="4.62">something artists can do and when Alex</text>
  <text start="446.739" dur="4.74">does satire boom well he&amp;#39;s wrong and he</text>
  <text start="449.439" dur="7.14">says he&amp;#39;s talked to Q on the phone I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="451.479" dur="9.24">call him a liar all right because you</text>
  <text start="456.579" dur="7.65">know a good friend lets you doesn&amp;#39;t let</text>

  <text start="475.959" dur="4.651">treat you is it worth money or whatever</text>
  <text start="477.849" dur="5.43">it is that you&amp;#39;re getting you&amp;#39;re ruining</text>

  <text start="486.969" dur="3.96">that story like my brother and sister</text>
  <text start="488.739" dur="5.46">and mother and stuff tough love is part</text>
  <text start="490.929" dur="5.37">of part of the deal with Nemo&amp;#39;s and it</text>
  <text start="494.199" dur="4.17">is definitely not malicious and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="496.299" dur="3.15">even personal against you know some of</text>
  <text start="498.369" dur="2.94">the personal attacks and stuff I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="499.449" dur="5.64">received I just want to win this war I</text>
  <text start="501.309" dur="6.33">want to heal and stop the division and</text>
  <text start="505.089" dur="4.92">create more unity in the Q community and</text>
  <text start="507.639" dur="5.52">the best way to do that obviously is</text>
  <text start="510.009" dur="5.851">with a full-fledged debate showing the</text>
  <text start="513.159" dur="4.641">evidence all at once and hearing their</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="5.069">side of the argument all at once and</text>
  <text start="517.8" dur="5.409">doing it in a way where you know if you</text>
  <text start="520.929" dur="4.981">watch this you&amp;#39;re going to be convinced</text>
  <text start="523.209" dur="5.041">one way or the other and if you then</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="4.769">still choose to tell the same lies after</text>
  <text start="528.25" dur="4.22">an honest debate that the community can</text>
  <text start="530.679" dur="4.471">can peer review</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="5.59">then you are exposed as an obvious liar</text>
  <text start="535.15" dur="5.31">and shill you know for all to see in a</text>
