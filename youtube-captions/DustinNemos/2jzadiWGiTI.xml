  <text start="62.69" dur="3.63">there</text>
  <text start="63.07" dur="5.47">so former US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald</text>
  <text start="66.32" dur="2.67">is the godfather of one of James Comey</text>
  <text start="68.54" dur="2.61">kids</text>
  <text start="68.99" dur="6.14">additionally Fitzgerald was a prosecutor</text>
  <text start="71.15" dur="6.389">of recently pardoned Lewis Scooter Libby</text>
  <text start="75.13" dur="4.629">Fitzgerald was also the person who Lisa</text>
  <text start="77.539" dur="4.741">Paige and Peter Strock recommended in</text>
  <text start="79.759" dur="4.381">their text messages debating the</text>
  <text start="82.28" dur="3.21">possible need for a special counsel</text>
  <text start="84.14" dur="4.29">looking into the actions of Hillary</text>

  <text start="93.53" dur="4.5">for any and all legal issues within the</text>
  <text start="96.35" dur="5.4">circle of the small group of</text>
  <text start="98.03" dur="6.72">co-conspirators the crew who politicized</text>
  <text start="101.75" dur="5.159">and weaponized the DOJ and FBI to target</text>
  <text start="104.75" dur="4.049">their political opposition according to</text>
  <text start="106.909" dur="4.2">recent reports a Fitzgerald has also</text>
  <text start="108.799" dur="4.941">been hired by James Comey in advance of</text>
  <text start="111.109" dur="4.561">possible criminal indictments and</text>
  <text start="113.74" dur="4.869">another article down here from the</text>
  <text start="115.67" dur="5.82">gateway pundit says fired FBI chief</text>
  <text start="118.609" dur="5.61">James Comey told reporters in his at his</text>
  <text start="121.49" dur="5.009">book signing Tuesday in Chicago he hired</text>
  <text start="124.219" dur="4.491">former US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald</text>
  <text start="126.499" dur="5.101">last year around the time he was fired</text>
  <text start="128.71" dur="4.81">call me admitted last year during</text>
  <text start="131.6" dur="3.99">congressional testimony that he leaked</text>
  <text start="133.52" dur="3.99">memos to his close friend Daniel</text>
  <text start="135.59" dur="4.47">Richmond a law professor at Columbia</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="5.11">University in order to push a special</text>
  <text start="140.06" dur="4">counsel against President Trump</text>
  <text start="142.62" dur="4.229">Richmond announced in January of this</text>
  <text start="144.06" dur="5.13">year that he was a commis lawyer so</text>
  <text start="146.849" dur="4.681">apparently he has a multi lawyer team of</text>
  <text start="149.19" dur="5.219">cronies ready to defend him also worth</text>
  <text start="151.53" dur="5.069">mentioning this this Richmond fellow</text>
  <text start="154.409" dur="6.211">Daniel Richmond the law professor at</text>
  <text start="156.599" dur="7.411">Columbia University also apparently was</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="6.69">an unpaid FBI worker had some sort of</text>
  <text start="164.01" dur="6.39">special government agent status so I</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t know how that affects or if he was</text>
  <text start="170.4" dur="4.169">you know able to receive classified</text>
  <text start="172.98" dur="4.14">information if he had clearance for that</text>
  <text start="174.569" dur="4.5">I don&amp;#39;t know how that affects the the</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="4.5">leaking maybe it would be his crime for</text>
  <text start="179.069" dur="4.581">leaking to the press since Comey gave it</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="4.709">to him and if he had classified</text>
  <text start="183.65" dur="6.04">clearance for that then maybe the lawyer</text>
  <text start="186.329" dur="4.681">himself would be liable for then leaking</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="3.359">that information and maybe that would</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="5.61">shift some of that blame away from call</text>
  <text start="193.049" dur="5.16">me I don&amp;#39;t know how that affects things</text>
  <text start="196.62" dur="2.94">legally and it called me still a bad guy</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="5.011">obviously and I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="199.56" dur="5.489">to escape justice off this and Sarah</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="4.98">Carter is just blowing things out of the</text>
  <text start="205.049" dur="5.66">water as usual she says I&amp;#39;m wondering if</text>
  <text start="208.2" dur="5.46">she&amp;#39;s been chosen by the way as sort of</text>
  <text start="210.709" dur="4.721">a way to break some of this to the</text>
  <text start="213.66" dur="4.079">normies you know she she covers some</text>
  <text start="215.43" dur="4.86">hard-hitting stuff and she&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="217.739" dur="5.31">mccabe may have issued the stand-down</text>
  <text start="220.29" dur="5.729">order on FBI Hillary Clinton email</text>
  <text start="223.049" dur="9.541">investigation which is back on by the</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="7.891">way and Zero Hedge reporting that a very</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="4.2">pissed-off Obama</text>
  <text start="233.91" dur="6.38">DOJ official made the dramatic call to</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="5.64">McCabe to quash the Clinton probe so</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="4.33">McCabe may have issued the stand-down</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="5.279">order but it seemed like he was being</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="7.049">told according to this narrative from</text>
  <text start="247.709" dur="6.331">some Obama DOJ guy and that guy has</text>
  <text start="251.669" dur="3.331">pretty much been fingered as Mathew</text>
  <text start="254.04" dur="3.36">Axelrod</text>
  <text start="255" dur="4.38">so let me read from this real fast as</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="4.079">the FBI&amp;#39;s investigation into the Clinton</text>
  <text start="259.38" dur="4.469">Foundation pressed on during the 2016</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="4.741">election a senior official with the</text>
  <text start="263.849" dur="6.181">Obama Justice Department identified as a</text>
  <text start="266.22" dur="5.61">Mathew Axelrod called former FBI deputy</text>
  <text start="270.03" dur="3.84">director Andrew McCabe who thought the</text>
  <text start="271.83" dur="4.56">DOJ was pressuring him to shut down the</text>
  <text start="273.87" dur="4.74">investigation according to the recently</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="5.88">released Inspector General&amp;#39;s lig report</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="5.79">and if you listen very quietly you can</text>
  <text start="282.27" dur="4.65">almost hear the echo of when McCabe said</text>
  <text start="284.4" dur="3.93">he would burn down the FBI if he were</text>
  <text start="286.92" dur="2.94">going down right like something along</text>
  <text start="288.33" dur="3.81">the lines of I&amp;#39;ll take you all down with</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="4.37">me I think I can almost hear that in the</text>
  <text start="292.14" dur="8.16">background I&amp;#39;m sure that you can as well</text>
  <text start="294.23" dur="7.9">anyway moving on and a dramatic and in</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="4.8">if you&amp;#39;re paying attention I think</text>

  <text start="305.1" dur="5.3">Democrats seem to be shifting at full</text>
  <text start="307.41" dur="5.49">speed away from their we hate Trump</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="4.36">everything that Trump does is racist</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="3.54">platform which is not winning the many</text>
  <text start="314.76" dur="3.45">votes you know they&amp;#39;re their platform of</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="5.22">wanting to raise taxes and hate Trump</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="6.39">and in in his base which is the majority</text>
  <text start="321.66" dur="5.88">of the country they&amp;#39;re shifting that</text>
  <text start="324.6" dur="6.06">over to full-on communist here&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="327.54" dur="4.56">free vote for me now I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="330.66" dur="2.7">go through a couple things and then I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="332.1" dur="3.39">going to explain why I think that is</text>
  <text start="333.36" dur="5.19">really scary okay I&amp;#39;m gonna read a few</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="4.86">things first this article is called what</text>
  <text start="338.55" dur="3.75">could go wrong from the gateway pundit</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="4.23">socialist Bernie Sanders proposes</text>
  <text start="342.3" dur="7.11">government jobs for all with health care</text>
  <text start="344.58" dur="8.1">and the $15 hour minimum wage in March</text>
  <text start="349.41" dur="5.4">2007 Venezuelans voted in socialists in</text>
  <text start="352.68" dur="4.2">Cuban Lackey Hugo Chavez as president</text>
  <text start="354.81" dur="3.78">eleven years later the country&amp;#39;s near</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="4.41">collapse the people are starving in the</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="5.01">Marxist refused to relinquish power the</text>
  <text start="361.29" dur="4.44">average uh Venezuelan today has lost 24</text>
  <text start="363.6" dur="4.68">pounds since the food shortages began</text>
  <text start="365.73" dur="4.41">Western media refuses to focus on this</text>
  <text start="368.28" dur="4.65">tragedy because they all supported this</text>
  <text start="370.14" dur="4.65">far-left regime now socialist Bernie</text>
  <text start="372.93" dur="3.96">Sanders wants to bring this destruction</text>
  <text start="374.79" dur="4.05">and suffering to the u.s. also in the</text>
  <text start="376.89" dur="3.6">same article I believe it says the</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="3.72">children and adults are fighting over</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="4.11">garbage now that may that may be a</text>
  <text start="382.56" dur="7.62">separate article I didn&amp;#39;t write it down</text>
  <text start="384.6" dur="7.89">and some of my personal thoughts I</text>
  <text start="390.18" dur="4.53">wanted to put in there as the dims go</text>
  <text start="392.49" dur="5.67">full communism and begin using bribes</text>
  <text start="394.71" dur="5.55">for votes directly expect a surge in</text>
  <text start="398.16" dur="4.26">popularity and energy from their young</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="4.71">and indebted thought slave crowd these</text>
  <text start="402.42" dur="4.35">are definitely the antifa types that</text>
  <text start="404.97" dur="4.61">have all that student debt and no</text>
  <text start="406.77" dur="5.419">prospects because they they majored in</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="4.649">propaganda studies and their experts on</text>
  <text start="412.189" dur="4.44">why everything is racist but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="414.229" dur="5.571">experts on work ethic or you know</text>
  <text start="416.629" dur="6.241">qualifying for basically any basic job</text>
  <text start="419.8" dur="5.109">so you know they got a really bad deal</text>
  <text start="422.87" dur="5.28">they came out of it dumber and meaner</text>
  <text start="424.909" dur="5.551">and more filled with hate and with less</text>
  <text start="428.15" dur="5.37">opportunities than they went into it and</text>
  <text start="430.46" dur="5.929">this is I think as much the fault of the</text>
  <text start="433.52" dur="4.889">parents in many cases as the kids</text>
  <text start="436.389" dur="4.15">because they they were still pushing</text>
  <text start="438.409" dur="4.98">that old wisdom of go to school get a</text>
  <text start="440.539" dur="4.981">good education go to college which is at</text>
  <text start="443.389" dur="3.75">least 20 30 years out-of-date at this</text>
  <text start="445.52" dur="5.1">point and is actually pretty bad advice</text>
  <text start="447.139" dur="7.31">these days the Internet has changed the</text>
  <text start="450.62" dur="6.419">way education works and most employers</text>
  <text start="454.449" dur="5.77">if they&amp;#39;re if they&amp;#39;re being honest are</text>
  <text start="457.039" dur="6">going to prefer experience or certain</text>
  <text start="460.219" dur="5.01">work traits or even if you&amp;#39;re being fair</text>
  <text start="463.039" dur="3.81">I mean high IQ is probably just an</text>
  <text start="465.229" dur="5.75">indicator of a good employee in many</text>
  <text start="466.849" dur="7.35">cases across many different spec metrics</text>
  <text start="470.979" dur="5.201">but you know we&amp;#39;ve got Venezuela as an</text>
  <text start="474.199" dur="3.361">example we have Mexico about to vote in</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="3.72">a Marxist they&amp;#39;re about to follow the</text>
  <text start="477.56" dur="4.77">same the same route</text>
  <text start="479.9" dur="4.019">never underestimate and this is the main</text>
  <text start="482.33" dur="4.79">point I want to make never underestimate</text>
  <text start="483.919" dur="6.75">the lure of free stuff to stupid people</text>
  <text start="487.12" dur="5.799">this is going to be a winning issue for</text>
  <text start="490.669" dur="3.36">the Democrats free stuff for all and if</text>
  <text start="492.919" dur="3.511">you don&amp;#39;t like it you&amp;#39;re a terrible</text>
  <text start="494.029" dur="3.961">person okay</text>
  <text start="496.43" dur="3.659">it&amp;#39;s gonna get them a lot of votes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="3.229">gadem and the marijuana issue are gonna</text>
  <text start="500.089" dur="4.14">get them a lot of votes</text>
  <text start="501.219" dur="5.021">this makes them in danger okay people</text>
  <text start="504.229" dur="4.291">are fed up with the Russian Trump stuff</text>
  <text start="506.24" dur="5.429">they&amp;#39;re fed up with the hate hate hate</text>
  <text start="508.52" dur="4.97">Trump crowd but they are not fed up with</text>
  <text start="511.669" dur="4.321">the free stuff and people are</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="4.12">economically illiterate in most cases</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="3.779">and they are gonna go for this they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="517.61" dur="4.53">gonna fall for it just like all of those</text>
  <text start="519.769" dur="4.351">places that voted in $15 an hour minimum</text>
  <text start="522.14" dur="3.87">wage and then all those people get fired</text>
  <text start="524.12" dur="4.35">and replaced with a robot because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.01" dur="4.65">just not worth it anymore you cannot</text>
  <text start="528.47" dur="5.79">force the market all you do is destroy</text>
  <text start="530.66" dur="6.39">opportunity every time you try so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.26" dur="5.819">my point on that this is this is small</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="5.84">news today but it is a start of a</text>
  <text start="540.079" dur="5.911">dangerous trend if you&amp;#39;re following</text>
  <text start="542.89" dur="5.58">not just the Democrat Republican fight</text>
  <text start="545.99" dur="5.16">for influence but the economic issue</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="6.31">which is greater and infects the entire</text>
  <text start="551.15" dur="5.79">world even and in some ways this</text>
  <text start="554.78" dur="4.86">Democrat Republican is is the same fight</text>
  <text start="556.94" dur="6.66">that&amp;#39;s left versus right across all of</text>
  <text start="559.64" dur="5.97">Western society basically I mean it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="563.6" dur="4.65">a lot of Western societies we&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="565.61" dur="4.32">strongest bastion of right is a couple</text>
  <text start="568.25" dur="5.55">of countries in the US has a large</text>
  <text start="569.93" dur="5.19">bastion of right as well but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="573.8" dur="4.26">where you&amp;#39;re seeing the nationalism</text>
  <text start="575.12" dur="4.86">research and stuff a lot of countries</text>
  <text start="578.06" dur="6.75">are pretty much lost as long at this</text>
  <text start="579.98" dur="7.47">point like Sweden and we may not be</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="5.12">pulling out of Syria after all after</text>
  <text start="587.45" dur="5.85">Netanyahu calls Trump and has a tough</text>
  <text start="589.93" dur="5.65">discussion and now a general is going to</text>
  <text start="593.3" dur="4.26">Israel to affirm basically that we are</text>
  <text start="595.58" dur="4.08">not pulling out of Syria this is</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="4.94">troubling it makes Trump look like</text>
  <text start="599.66" dur="6.87">Netanyahu&amp;#39;s bitch let&amp;#39;s be honest and</text>
  <text start="602.5" dur="6.52">there&amp;#39;s already too much of this this</text>
  <text start="606.53" dur="5.49">thought that Trump is you know in the</text>
  <text start="609.02" dur="5.01">pocket of the Jews I don&amp;#39;t want anything</text>
  <text start="612.02" dur="4.13">that&amp;#39;s gonna just give those people ammo</text>
  <text start="614.03" dur="4.05">I mean no disrespect to those people I</text>
  <text start="616.15" dur="4.9">definitely have my questions about</text>
  <text start="618.08" dur="6.42">Zionism and and the influence that</text>
  <text start="621.05" dur="4.95">Israel has and the Israel lobby has in</text>
  <text start="624.5" dur="3.57">the US government I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
