  <text start="50.399" dur="6.031">going on with them they&amp;#39;re a economic</text>
  <text start="52.71" dur="5.07">superpower almost they you know they had</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="3.84">their fragile in a lot of ways but</text>
  <text start="57.78" dur="5.669">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re a big economy they have</text>
  <text start="60.27" dur="5.4">a lot of world power they&amp;#39;re a lot of a</text>
  <text start="63.449" dur="6.151">lot of our supply comes from there as</text>
  <text start="65.67" dur="5.879">well so they&amp;#39;re there bribing our</text>
  <text start="69.6" dur="3.839">politicians like Feinstein obviously I</text>
  <text start="71.549" dur="3.901">mean she had that Chinese spy for</text>
  <text start="73.439" dur="4.531">20-plus years she became very wealthy</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="5.64">almost a million dollars in public</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="6.09">service Chuck you know Hillary was</text>
  <text start="81.09" dur="7.169">selling us out s AP level programs to</text>
  <text start="84.06" dur="5.91">any she would basically just like a</text>
  <text start="88.259" dur="4.921">whorehouse I mean she was just open for</text>
  <text start="89.97" dur="5.969">business doesn&amp;#39;t matter no no no morals</text>
  <text start="93.18" dur="4.829">about it just do it she&amp;#39;d sell us out to</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="3.621">whoever for pennies for you know these</text>
  <text start="98.009" dur="5.701">things are worth a lot more money to</text>
  <text start="99.56" dur="6.339">sold out our uranium so China&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="103.71" dur="4.86">that well that was actually to Russia</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="3.921">but the point made China is really the</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="5.28">big issue</text>
  <text start="109.82" dur="6.579">Russia is hated or love it whatever</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="4.049">they&amp;#39;re not nearly on the same level s</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="4.26">China other than the fact that they are</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="6.29">both military superpowers and they are</text>
  <text start="120.659" dur="5.64">both allied they&amp;#39;re working together so</text>
  <text start="124.189" dur="4.54">the thing that bothers me about Russia</text>
  <text start="126.299" dur="4.32">would be if we go to war with Russia but</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="4.101">economically speaking Russia&amp;#39;s no threat</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="2.211">to us</text>
  <text start="133.56" dur="5.43">China however is in China is incredibly</text>
  <text start="136.47" dur="5.4">aggressive expansionist nationalist</text>
  <text start="138.99" dur="4.65">people who gonna they&amp;#39;re going for</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="4.86">global domination just look at Emperor</text>
  <text start="143.64" dur="5.28">Jian paying over there anyway he is</text>
  <text start="146.73" dur="6.15">putting out a link I bet you it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="6.24">Mike Pence speech and it is of course</text>
  <text start="152.88" dur="4.46">and I watched that whole thing on the</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="5.16">edge of my seat it was really good</text>
  <text start="157.34" dur="6.04">everything that he said fit without what</text>
  <text start="160.32" dur="4.74">I know of china and what&amp;#39;s going on made</text>
  <text start="163.38" dur="3.39">a lot of sense to me definitely give it</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="5.25">a listen if he can I uploaded it on my</text>
  <text start="166.77" dur="5.52">channel recently I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="170.31" dur="5.48">taking it down when they can basically</text>
  <text start="172.29" dur="6.18">it was a huge turning point in history</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="4.57">it was it was the US government at the</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="6.15">highest levels calling out China for a</text>
  <text start="180.36" dur="6.9">lot of bad stuff and I&amp;#39;m standing up to</text>
  <text start="184.62" dur="5.43">them and their bullying tactics over the</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="5.16">one China policy over Taiwan the South</text>
  <text start="190.05" dur="4.46">China Sea everything it&amp;#39;s a turning</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="4.35">point in our relationship with China so</text>
  <text start="194.51" dur="4.18">Q says worth forty three minutes of your</text>
  <text start="196.77" dur="4.62">time fake news will never report</text>
  <text start="198.69" dur="6.18">important to understand going forward</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="5.43">facts and matter so this thing with</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="4.23">China guys I think is gonna get a lot</text>
  <text start="206.82" dur="3.66">bigger I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.1" dur="4.05">gonna go into a hot war although it</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="7.38">could but I think that it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="213.15" dur="5.88">the next cold war with China and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="217.86" dur="2.91">gonna definitely hit us economically</text>
  <text start="219.03" dur="3.9">speaking we&amp;#39;re gonna go through some</text>
  <text start="220.77" dur="4.68">harder times over it</text>
  <text start="222.93" dur="5.04">I still think will win we have a more</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="4.38">generalized independent system than</text>
  <text start="227.97" dur="5.67">China has they&amp;#39;re very dependent on</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="5.97">imports of the base goods and exports of</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="5.46">their main you know their manufacturing</text>
  <text start="235.8" dur="5.52">behemoth it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s pulling all the</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="3.42">raw materials make quite cheap crap and</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="3.87">then sell it that&amp;#39;s what runs their</text>
  <text start="242.52" dur="4.92">economy they&amp;#39;re already having a real</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="3.9">estate pop as well of their bubble</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re having a lot of pain</text>
  <text start="249.09" dur="6">from this trade war it&amp;#39;s only going to</text>
  <text start="252.09" dur="5.55">continue so you know we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="255.09" dur="3.81">happens and they&amp;#39;re not independent so</text>
  <text start="257.64" dur="3.24">if they&amp;#39;re not self-sufficient they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="3.54">trying to buy land in Africa and borrow</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="3.03">Lin from Russia and everything else now</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="2.79">to try to feed themselves but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="263.91" dur="5.64">not self-sufficient</text>

  <text start="308.91" dur="4.23">a great thing for freedom this is a</text>
  <text start="310.59" dur="4.74">great step to stop more encroachment</text>
  <text start="313.14" dur="3.87">from communism which you know the host</text>

  <text start="321.42" dur="6.33">without force he says non force yeah</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="7.23">absolutely and I&amp;#39;m sure they had a</text>
  <text start="327.75" dur="8.76">military plan ready to go but I&amp;#39;m glad</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="7.83">we didn&amp;#39;t have to our movement is about</text>
  <text start="336.51" dur="6.6">replacing a failed system so he says</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="5.67">thank HRC when Hillary leading to</text>

  <text start="365.46" dur="4.95">meeting they basically promised Lynch a</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="4.49">place on the Supreme Court to turn the</text>
  <text start="370.41" dur="5.16">other eye on the Hillary investigation</text>
  <text start="372.86" dur="5.37">and it&amp;#39;s funny because now Laura Lynch&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="415" dur="3.599">to force it it only works with the</text>
  <text start="416.56" dur="4.02">idiots and as long as there&amp;#39;s a better</text>

  <text start="442.75" dur="4.349">say out there I don&amp;#39;t have the words but</text>
  <text start="445.419" dur="4.56">he says this movement challenges people</text>
  <text start="447.099" dur="6">to not simply trust what is being</text>
  <text start="449.979" dur="6">reported research for yourself think for</text>
  <text start="453.099" dur="5.641">yourself trust yourself sounds like a</text>
  <text start="455.979" dur="4.731">cult to me not really I can&amp;#39;t stand</text>
  <text start="458.74" dur="4.38">those people that call kyudo q a cult</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="3.94">makes no sense the only cult where you</text>
  <text start="463.12" dur="2.76">don&amp;#39;t know the leader and no one&amp;#39;s met</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="5.43">the leader and he tells you to think for</text>
  <text start="465.88" dur="6.899">yourself this movement is not about one</text>
  <text start="470.08" dur="5.55">person or a group of people we the</text>
  <text start="472.779" dur="5.67">people save the Republic hatred and</text>

  <text start="484.449" dur="4.051">with China would help push the healing</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="4.559">and the unification aspect because war</text>
  <text start="488.5" dur="4.11">has a way of doing that suffering has a</text>
  <text start="491.169" dur="3.391">way of doing that as well I think some</text>

  <text start="494.56" dur="5.039">inevitably going to happen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="4.529">unavoidable I think that will help push</text>
  <text start="499.599" dur="6.481">us together - because mutual suffering</text>
  <text start="501.219" dur="7.681">will bind us back together but on its</text>
