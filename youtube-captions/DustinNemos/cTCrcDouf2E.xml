  <text start="1.34" dur="7.65">welcome back guys so there is a</text>
  <text start="6.029" dur="7.701">narrative going around the potential</text>
  <text start="8.99" dur="10.06">that the entire Trump queuing on</text>
  <text start="13.73" dur="10.049">movement is a my dogs yawning here that</text>
  <text start="19.05" dur="9.149">they&amp;#39;re cute is a big distraction</text>
  <text start="23.779" dur="7.471">controlled opposition if you&amp;#39;ve watched</text>
  <text start="28.199" dur="6.211">the Star Wars Episode one two three</text>
  <text start="31.25" dur="5.44">where the Emperor basically it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="4.29">his origin story almost hits how he came</text>
  <text start="36.69" dur="4.88">to power in the Republic and how he took</text>
  <text start="38.7" dur="5.19">over he used the separatist movement</text>
  <text start="41.57" dur="7.12">which was controlled by his apprentice</text>
  <text start="43.89" dur="8.939">the guy with the red face he used this</text>
  <text start="48.69" dur="6.509">separatist movement to build fear in the</text>
  <text start="52.829" dur="5.041">government and he basically just played</text>
  <text start="55.199" dur="4.59">both sides against each other someone</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="10.2">brought this this analogy up for me</text>
  <text start="59.789" dur="9.9">earlier so possibly but the reason I</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the case is because</text>
  <text start="69.689" dur="5.071">the fruit of the tree theory if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="72.51" dur="4.23">following the fruit of the tree in this</text>
  <text start="74.76" dur="4.74">case the fruit of the queue and on or</text>
  <text start="76.74" dur="6.12">the Trump tree and we&amp;#39;re judging by the</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="7.11">actions rather than the words the</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="7.32">effects of Trump have been - in this</text>
  <text start="86.61" dur="8.82">analogy call out Palpatine directly</text>
  <text start="90.18" dur="7.5">basically he has he has made the deep</text>
  <text start="95.43" dur="6.27">state a household name which you know I</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="6.6">say this often he has directly went</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="4.29">against the power of the elite in the</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="3.6">control mechanisms that they have over</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="3.659">the people by lowering regulations</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="8.19">lowering taxes now he&amp;#39;s cutting federal</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="8.731">workers he is you know the executive</text>
  <text start="116.07" dur="5.009">order could potentially be used against</text>
  <text start="118.38" dur="5">good guys as well but it does seem to</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="7.02">target human trafficking and corruption</text>
  <text start="123.38" dur="7.329">so in the analogy of Palpatine versus</text>
  <text start="128.099" dur="4.621">the separatist movement being played and</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="3.031">owned by Palpatine it would be like the</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="4.53">separatist movement</text>
  <text start="133.74" dur="6.69">was calling him out directly and saying</text>
  <text start="137.25" dur="6.12">you know this guy&amp;#39;s corrupt as hell he</text>
  <text start="140.43" dur="4.23">should be in jail that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="143.37" dur="5.67">bit different than what happened in the</text>
  <text start="144.66" dur="6.75">Star Wars movie so that analogy there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="7.68">good fruit from the Trump tree very anti</text>
  <text start="151.41" dur="11.4">elite interests fruit the queue anon</text>
  <text start="156.72" dur="10.56">tree the fruit of a tree is an organized</text>
  <text start="162.81" dur="6.33">and energized base of truthers for the</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="3.69">first time like back in the day when we</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="3.93">were trying to spread this truth our own</text>
  <text start="170.97" dur="4.05">families wouldn&amp;#39;t take us seriously</text>
  <text start="173.07" dur="4.59">we&amp;#39;ve all been through it right it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="175.02" dur="4.29">lonely dark depressing place to be and</text>
  <text start="177.66" dur="3.27">most of us have gave him get gave up at</text>
  <text start="179.31" dur="6.51">that point I know I did I was like I</text>
  <text start="180.93" dur="8.55">said in the nihilist state of mind my</text>
  <text start="185.82" dur="7.29">plan was to just kind of ignore reality</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="6.87">as long as I could I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna have</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="5.21">children or anything I could kind of see</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="8.16">where things were headed</text>
  <text start="198.32" dur="9.19">but after queuing on not only are we no</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="4.92">longer alone no longer isn&amp;#39;t no longer</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="5.79">that depressing I mean now it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="209.43" dur="6.63">we&amp;#39;re in a community it&amp;#39;s fun sort of to</text>
  <text start="213.3" dur="4.62">wake up like we&amp;#39;re engaged we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="4.8">researching we&amp;#39;re on projects we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.92" dur="5.94">actually having organized meme war days</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="5.37">where we&amp;#39;ve where we use memes to spread</text>
  <text start="223.86" dur="4.17">truth to people and this is a very</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="6.33">powerful psychological trick there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="7.32">actually like military war papers</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="6.03">written about the ability of memes to</text>
  <text start="235.35" dur="5.46">influence people right so it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="238.59" dur="5.36">an internet junky thing this is</text>
  <text start="240.81" dur="8.99">legitimate warfare through an idea base</text>
  <text start="243.95" dur="9.04">through like a psychological warfare so</text>
  <text start="249.8" dur="5.74">it&amp;#39;s fun it&amp;#39;s no longer lonely its</text>
  <text start="252.99" dur="5.4">energized it&amp;#39;s exciting we are</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="6.259">effectively communicating with with</text>
  <text start="258.39" dur="3.409">millions of people at this point</text>
  <text start="262.34" dur="4.71">I think that all of these things are</text>
  <text start="265.1" dur="3.599">very very good for the movement and</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="3.81">whole I think that all of these things</text>
  <text start="268.699" dur="5.131">are very good fruit for the tree and all</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="6.15">of these things are the exact opposite</text>
  <text start="273.83" dur="4.98">of what the elite want they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="3.42">to free people up and give them more</text>
  <text start="278.81" dur="3.87">income they want the taxes and the</text>
  <text start="280.43" dur="3.959">regulations in the control grid and they</text>
  <text start="282.68" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t want their enemy which are</text>
  <text start="284.389" dur="4.5">truthers the few of us who know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.79" dur="5.49">going on in the world which is you guys</text>
  <text start="288.889" dur="4.831">myself the other anons the people that</text>
  <text start="292.28" dur="3.15">have been around for a long time telling</text>
  <text start="293.72" dur="5.13">the truth but being largely ignored all</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="5.85">of us are truthers to some degree or</text>
  <text start="298.85" dur="3.99">another you know red pills it&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="3.42">on/off there&amp;#39;s not just one red pill</text>
  <text start="302.84" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s a spectrum with many many many red</text>
  <text start="304.7" dur="8.18">pills to find so never stop your</text>
  <text start="307.37" dur="5.51">research never stop learning but</text>
  <text start="314.409" dur="7.5">in that sense it would be kind of</text>
  <text start="319.599" dur="5.04">counterproductive for them to to do what</text>
  <text start="321.909" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re doing or to do what their some</text>
  <text start="324.639" dur="2.941">people are saying this is a controlled</text>
  <text start="326.139" dur="3.54">opposition if that&amp;#39;s if they&amp;#39;re behind</text>
  <text start="327.58" dur="6.689">it they&amp;#39;re shooting themselves in the</text>
  <text start="329.679" dur="6.151">foot because maybe we won&amp;#39;t win but</text>
  <text start="334.269" dur="5.4">we&amp;#39;re gonna certainly be more effective</text>
  <text start="335.83" dur="5.339">after this so especially with Trump</text>
  <text start="339.669" dur="3.03">having destroyed the credibility of the</text>
  <text start="341.169" dur="3.54">mainstream media I mean that&amp;#39;s a biggie</text>
  <text start="342.699" dur="4.01">right there that&amp;#39;s their that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="344.709" dur="4.53">puppet mouthpiece that&amp;#39;s their control</text>
  <text start="346.709" dur="4.69">if you don&amp;#39;t control the media then you</text>
  <text start="349.239" dur="4.53">eventually get civil war after all the</text>
  <text start="351.399" dur="5.45">lies because the people won&amp;#39;t have won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="353.769" dur="8.66">take the BS from the government forever</text>
  <text start="356.849" dur="11.53">unless they&amp;#39;re controlled like mentally</text>
  <text start="362.429" dur="11.65">so I don&amp;#39;t buy into the controlled</text>
  <text start="368.379" dur="7.11">opposition thing it&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="374.079" dur="3.66">with the people that are saying Q is a</text>
  <text start="375.489" dur="6.72">LARP or he is this prankster John Titor</text>
  <text start="377.739" dur="6.36">or any of this other stuff out there the</text>
  <text start="382.209" dur="3.57">evidence you know I have to follow the</text>
  <text start="384.099" dur="3.18">evidence I have to follow reason and</text>
  <text start="385.779" dur="5.73">logic if you watch my channel you know I</text>
  <text start="387.279" dur="5.88">don&amp;#39;t go into stuff I can&amp;#39;t prove you</text>
  <text start="391.509" dur="4.38">know I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t talk about aliens I</text>
  <text start="393.159" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t talk about prophecies I don&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="395.889" dur="3.39">about Flat Earth I don&amp;#39;t talk about any</text>
  <text start="397.869" dur="4.98">of this stuff whether or not you believe</text>
  <text start="399.279" dur="7.2">it&amp;#39;s true I can&amp;#39;t prove it so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="402.849" dur="5.43">talk about it I do talk about logic</text>
  <text start="406.479" dur="5.49">reason and evidence and where we can go</text>
  <text start="408.279" dur="5.34">with that which i think is the only path</text>
  <text start="411.969" dur="8.3">to wake up other people and the only</text>
  <text start="413.619" dur="6.65">path to red pill the masses so</text>
  <text start="420.559" dur="7.05">I believe in Q now what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="424.669" dur="5.16">lately with with him self-destructing</text>
  <text start="427.609" dur="6.24">his own post to leading all of his posts</text>
  <text start="429.829" dur="6.78">on the Great Awakening board we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="433.849" dur="4.92">100% sure yet we do know in the past he</text>
  <text start="436.609" dur="4.85">said that self destruction post would</text>
  <text start="438.769" dur="7.38">come and he told us to archive</text>
  <text start="441.459" dur="6.01">everything offline save it we know that</text>
  <text start="446.149" dur="9.63">he said in the past that we have</text>
  <text start="447.469" dur="10.68">everything we need and we know that the</text>
  <text start="455.779" dur="4.32">new B which you know I still have my</text>
  <text start="458.149" dur="4.17">doubts but the new B is saying that this</text>
  <text start="460.099" dur="5.31">is only the beginning of the next phase</text>
  <text start="462.319" dur="5.39">that Q is not gone so we will we will</text>
  <text start="465.409" dur="6.03">see what&amp;#39;s going on guys we will still</text>
  <text start="467.709" dur="5.59">we will still be here talking about Q if</text>
  <text start="471.439" dur="3.3">he&amp;#39;s gone then we still have to figure</text>
  <text start="473.299" dur="3.24">out everything in the past that he said</text>
  <text start="474.739" dur="3.48">and how it relates to future events and</text>
  <text start="476.539" dur="3.9">if he&amp;#39;s not gone then we will be here to</text>
  <text start="478.219" dur="4.35">cover whatever happens with that and of</text>
  <text start="480.439" dur="7.59">course I&amp;#39;m still gonna cover the</text>
  <text start="482.569" dur="9">narrative through the fake news and the</text>
  <text start="488.029" dur="5.16">the true alternative narrative you know</text>
  <text start="491.569" dur="2.94">the Q and on narrative the truth or</text>
  <text start="493.189" dur="3.39">narrative whatever there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="494.509" dur="4.14">narratives flying about and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="496.579" dur="3.63">important to know both because the</text>
  <text start="498.649" dur="2.61">official narrative is the ideas that</text>
  <text start="500.209" dur="4.46">they&amp;#39;re trying to push</text>
  <text start="501.259" dur="6.51">that&amp;#39;s the mainstream media fake news</text>
  <text start="504.669" dur="4.99">dog and pony show the bread and circuses</text>
  <text start="507.769" dur="5.4">that we see on the TV and played out</text>
  <text start="509.659" dur="6.211">through the through the public stuff and</text>
  <text start="513.169" dur="6.631">then there&amp;#39;s the true narrative right so</text>
  <text start="515.87" dur="6.87">this is the words this is the actions so</text>
  <text start="519.8" dur="4.829">we follow their words to see what kind</text>
  <text start="522.74" dur="3.689">of manipulations are trying to push what</text>
  <text start="524.629" dur="3.661">what is their goal what are they trying</text>
  <text start="526.429" dur="4.321">to play what is it their move of the</text>
  <text start="528.29" dur="5.279">chess game and then we follow the</text>
  <text start="530.75" dur="4.35">actions because the actions tell us</text>
  <text start="533.569" dur="3.721">what&amp;#39;s really going on behind the scenes</text>
  <text start="535.1" dur="6.989">we see their hidden moves and we see our</text>
  <text start="537.29" dur="7.889">counter moves so you know I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="542.089" dur="7.831">to watch TV and in fact I don&amp;#39;t even own</text>
  <text start="545.179" dur="6.301">a TV I was in my monitor which is a kind</text>
  <text start="549.92" dur="2.53">of a TV I guess but I don&amp;#39;t use it for</text>
  <text start="551.48" dur="5.77">TV</text>
  <text start="552.45" dur="7.83">I basically I stay tuned to the articles</text>
  <text start="557.25" dur="4.77">I read the important stuff I try to</text>
  <text start="560.28" dur="3.54">avoid most of the drama stuff that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="562.02" dur="2.94">as important culture is important but</text>
  <text start="563.82" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s a lot of the back-and-forth</text>
  <text start="564.96" dur="9.45">drama and I try to focus on what the key</text>
  <text start="569.82" dur="7.89">figures are doing players in the game so</text>
  <text start="574.41" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s it I hear my wife coming home so</text>
  <text start="577.71" dur="2.97">I&amp;#39;m gonna get off here but I just wanted</text>
  <text start="579.18" dur="2.82">to get this out there because there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="3.75">much I can sense it</text>
  <text start="582" dur="5.37">ever since that MSM article came out</text>
  <text start="584.43" dur="5.67">about us attacking Kuhn on as a big</text>
  <text start="587.37" dur="4.52">conspiracy theory the energy level of</text>
  <text start="590.1" dur="5.31">the troll side of this has just</text>
  <text start="591.89" dur="5.41">skyrocketed and at the same time we have</text>
  <text start="595.41" dur="5.58">some of the youtubers turning on cue and</text>
  <text start="597.3" dur="7.26">on saying he is John Titor or AI or a</text>
  <text start="600.99" dur="6.3">big LARP or whatever they want to say so</text>
  <text start="604.56" dur="5.58">the resistance against cue is is</text>
  <text start="607.29" dur="4.11">building and the attacks are bigger than</text>
  <text start="610.14" dur="4.59">ever you can just read through the</text>
  <text start="611.4" dur="5.69">comments and if you&amp;#39;ve been paying</text>
  <text start="614.73" dur="5.19">attention you&amp;#39;ve probably felt it too</text>
  <text start="617.09" dur="5.5">I&amp;#39;m in kind of a unique position here</text>
  <text start="619.92" dur="4.11">that I can see so many comments every</text>
  <text start="622.59" dur="4.49">day and I can kind of tell how many bad</text>
  <text start="624.03" dur="5.73">how many good there&amp;#39;s been a lot more</text>
  <text start="627.08" dur="5.68">you guys are stupid for believing in q</text>
  <text start="629.76" dur="5.93">and on hahaha types things okay so if</text>
  <text start="632.76" dur="5.43">you&amp;#39;re one of those people quit chillin</text>
  <text start="635.69" dur="5.83">if you really do genuinely believe it</text>
  <text start="638.19" dur="6.24">then consider my arguments here and if</text>
  <text start="641.52" dur="4.53">you are just doing this because the MSM</text>
  <text start="644.43" dur="3.63">told you it&amp;#39;s a big conspiracy theory</text>
  <text start="646.05" dur="5.13">then pull your head out of the sand all</text>
  <text start="648.06" dur="6.08">I can say hope you guys enjoyed this and</text>
