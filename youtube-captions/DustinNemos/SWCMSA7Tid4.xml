  <text start="32.16" dur="4.14">what&amp;#39;s going on in today&amp;#39;s world</text>
  <text start="33.96" dur="5.31">obviously the big exciting news is that</text>
  <text start="36.3" dur="4.26">mccabe actually did to get fired so many</text>
  <text start="39.27" dur="2.37">of you guys will bit information about</text>
  <text start="40.56" dur="3.87">that and i&amp;#39;m gonna go into a couple</text>
  <text start="41.64" dur="6.36">other things as well there&amp;#39;s not a whole</text>
  <text start="44.43" dur="5.13">lot to cover today but the quality of</text>
  <text start="48" dur="5.09">what we have to cover is pretty good</text>
  <text start="49.56" dur="7.23">considering we actually seen someone</text>
  <text start="53.09" dur="7.649">punished for the corruption to derail</text>
  <text start="56.79" dur="6.75">president Trump I mean McCabe was</text>
  <text start="60.739" dur="5.051">crooked as they come obviously and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="63.54" dur="4.74">probably not even that bad compared to</text>
  <text start="65.79" dur="6.03">people like Cole me and others but some</text>
  <text start="68.28" dur="5.31">of the things that he did he probably</text>
  <text start="71.82" dur="3.99">illegally kept some of his personal</text>
  <text start="73.59" dur="6.87">memos dealing with Trump just like Comey</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="9.3">did he leaked to the MSM he lied to</text>
  <text start="80.46" dur="7.409">Congress under oath and you know he now</text>
  <text start="85.11" dur="5.25">he&amp;#39;s trying to claim he&amp;#39;s gonna play the</text>
  <text start="87.869" dur="4.981">political approach of course that this</text>
  <text start="90.36" dur="7.59">was a political hit on him and he was</text>
  <text start="92.85" dur="9.71">fired for investigating Trump for what</text>
  <text start="97.95" dur="7.62">did he say Trump&amp;#39;s quote war on FBI now</text>
  <text start="102.56" dur="6.01">this comes with a loss of his I think</text>
  <text start="105.57" dur="7.29">1.8 million dollar pension that he gets</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="6.869">at just a mere 50 years of age these</text>
  <text start="112.86" dur="4.5">government jobs are getting a little too</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="4.731">cozy folks the rest of us are suffering</text>
  <text start="117.36" dur="5.61">out here and it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="120.17" dur="6.76">unfair to see some of the most corrupt</text>
  <text start="122.97" dur="6.659">people getting the best deal getting the</text>
  <text start="126.93" dur="5.25">good life getting the rewards and as</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="4.701">long as crime pays it stays folks so</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="4.73">please remember that</text>
  <text start="134.33" dur="6.26">when you are voting always try to revoke</text>
  <text start="136.91" dur="3.68">for less government as much as possible</text>
  <text start="141.1" dur="6.76">since then the fallout other Democrat</text>
  <text start="145.19" dur="4.97">lawmakers are offering to hire him to</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="4.86">try to help him qualify for his pension</text>
  <text start="150.16" dur="5.17">because he only had two days left to go</text>
  <text start="152.72" dur="3.84">and it&amp;#39;s all over Twitter with many of</text>
  <text start="155.33" dur="4.95">them I&amp;#39;m not even going to give all the</text>
  <text start="156.56" dur="5.22">names I will give you a link to where</text>
  <text start="160.28" dur="3.75">you can find more information about that</text>
  <text start="161.78" dur="3.81">if you want to me it&amp;#39;s kind of an</text>
  <text start="164.03" dur="3.54">obvious drama thing I just thought I</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="6">would mention it because I caved is on</text>
  <text start="167.57" dur="5.82">everyone&amp;#39;s mind today but not really</text>
  <text start="171.59" dur="5.88">that big a deal this is just the Dems</text>
  <text start="173.39" dur="6.66">being spiteful now Trump himself tweeted</text>
  <text start="177.47" dur="4.68">out the fake news is beside themselves</text>
  <text start="180.05" dur="4.62">that McCabe was caught called out and</text>
  <text start="182.15" dur="4.56">fired how many hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="184.67" dur="5.28">dollars was given to wife&amp;#39;s campaign by</text>
  <text start="186.71" dur="5.28">crooked Hillary friend Terry M who was</text>
  <text start="189.95" dur="4.14">also under investigation how many lies</text>
  <text start="191.99" dur="4.71">how many leaks call me knew it all and</text>
  <text start="194.09" dur="5.46">much more Trump now this is interesting</text>
  <text start="196.7" dur="6.15">because he brings call me back into this</text>
  <text start="199.55" dur="5.07">as well all right now McCabe is busted</text>
  <text start="202.85" dur="4.65">and he&amp;#39;s linking McCabe and called me</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="4.71">together this is obviously is gonna lead</text>
  <text start="207.5" dur="5.28">to call me getting busted as well as</text>
  <text start="209.33" dur="5.31">what I&amp;#39;m thinking and worth mentioning</text>
  <text start="212.78" dur="3.9">Alex Jones thinks that Hillary&amp;#39;s next</text>
  <text start="214.64" dur="4.89">and that the Hillary foundation is gonna</text>
  <text start="216.68" dur="6.18">start seeing some arrests as well q did</text>
  <text start="219.53" dur="8.49">say March Madness I remain cautiously</text>
  <text start="222.86" dur="7.68">optimistic a DOJ spokeswoman told the</text>
  <text start="228.02" dur="4.89">hill that quote Mr McCabe and his</text>
  <text start="230.54" dur="5.19">lawyers were informed in advance of the</text>
  <text start="232.91" dur="4.62">news media but then afterwards he still</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="7.13">tried to claim that he heard about his</text>
  <text start="237.53" dur="8.13">being fired in the news so a blatant lie</text>
  <text start="242.86" dur="5.379">playing politics trying to garner public</text>
  <text start="245.66" dur="3.299">sympathy trying to paint Trump in a</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="2.821">certain picture</text>
  <text start="248.959" dur="6.331">what do you at Wells do you expect from</text>
  <text start="251.06" dur="7.44">him remember that he also or ordered the</text>
  <text start="255.29" dur="6.15">FBI to falsify 302s which is a felony</text>
  <text start="258.5" dur="4.95">and he also threatened to take people</text>
  <text start="261.44" dur="4.68">down with him in the FBI remember he</text>
  <text start="263.45" dur="3.79">said something about burning down the</text>
  <text start="266.12" dur="6.49">FBI basically</text>
  <text start="267.24" dur="7.739">so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s not much else</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="4.589">to say about McCabe that&amp;#39;s relevant to</text>
  <text start="274.979" dur="5.551">today obviously he&amp;#39;s just another</text>
  <text start="277.199" dur="6.06">crooked Democrat deep stator he was in</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="5.55">bed with the Clintons and others his</text>
  <text start="283.259" dur="4.741">wife got a bunch of money from them he</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="3.51">did everything he could to try to stop</text>
  <text start="288" dur="3.389">Trump he was part of that little meeting</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="5.579">where they were discussing their back-up</text>
  <text start="291.389" dur="4.741">plan in case Trump won which obviously</text>
  <text start="295.169" dur="3.961">is the Russia thing</text>
  <text start="296.13" dur="6.15">so yes daddy&amp;#39;s talking she&amp;#39;s staring</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="6">right at me and so weird you guys see</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="5.58">that but yeah sorry I get distracted</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="5.52">easily now with my daughter that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.71">for Mackay now in the gun grabbing world</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="5.699">some of the students across the country</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="5.64">who are not wanting to participate in</text>
  <text start="316.349" dur="4.771">these student protests these student</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="6.929">walk outs basically they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="321.12" dur="7.71">be exploited by the anti-gun politics</text>
  <text start="325.139" dur="8.46">and Lobby are are facing arrests</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="7.89">suspensions punishments for for</text>
  <text start="333.599" dur="4.591">exercising their right to not to be part</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="4.169">of this not to be part of this gun</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="4.949">grabbing agenda we&amp;#39;ve seen some of them</text>
  <text start="340.889" dur="3.991">threatened with arrest we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="343.139" dur="3.931">students that showed up but had like a</text>
  <text start="344.88" dur="4.74">pro Trump sign or one of them had a sign</text>
  <text start="347.07" dur="3.87">that said guns don&amp;#39;t kill people people</text>
  <text start="349.62" dur="5.099">kill people and they were they were</text>
  <text start="350.94" dur="7.17">escorted off we&amp;#39;ve seen them threatened</text>
  <text start="354.719" dur="8.971">with suspensions we&amp;#39;ve seen them kicked</text>
  <text start="358.11" dur="7.14">out for days it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s really ugly</text>
  <text start="363.69" dur="3.719">seeing this kind of thing happening</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="4.979">we&amp;#39;ve even seen a teacher placed on</text>
  <text start="367.409" dur="5.581">leave in California for questioning the</text>
  <text start="370.229" dur="5.25">gun control walkout I mean she I believe</text>
  <text start="372.99" dur="4.729">that she had a discussion in the class</text>
  <text start="375.479" dur="4.651">about the politics behind this stuff</text>
  <text start="377.719" dur="4.991">kind of a neutral discussion and then</text>
  <text start="380.13" dur="5.219">they sent her home they would they</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="3.87">suspended her so and I&amp;#39;m sure they were</text>
  <text start="385.349" dur="4.261">fired her I think it&amp;#39;s pretty difficult</text>
  <text start="386.58" dur="5.459">to actually fire teachers the way the</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="4.89">system is set up it&amp;#39;s obviously you get</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="5.701">terrible terrible quality teachers and</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="5.069">they become Marxist morons which is why</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="4.5">our education system is so crap</text>
  <text start="399.569" dur="4.59">now when you can&amp;#39;t fire people being</text>
  <text start="402.24" dur="4.019">able to fire someone is a really good</text>
  <text start="404.159" dur="4.29">thing in order for quality control</text>
  <text start="406.259" dur="3.42">but with teachers unions and everything</text>
  <text start="408.449" dur="4.17">the way it&amp;#39;s set up it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="409.679" dur="6.99">impossible to fire them and that is an</text>
  <text start="412.619" dur="5.97">unfortunate thing I&amp;#39;m all for oh no I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="416.669" dur="4.411">all for privatizing the entire</text>
  <text start="418.589" dur="4.38">educational system if you&amp;#39;ve read the</text>
  <text start="421.08" dur="4.349">history of it the dumbing down of</text>
  <text start="422.969" dur="3.96">America for example you know that the</text>
  <text start="425.429" dur="4.04">whole thing is set up to make people</text>
  <text start="426.929" dur="6.091">stupid to make people serfs to make</text>
  <text start="429.469" dur="5.53">indoctrinated moron masses so we really</text>
  <text start="433.02" dur="4.769">got to get these Marxist teacher&amp;#39;s away</text>
  <text start="434.999" dur="4.53">from our kids we really have to get the</text>
  <text start="437.789" dur="3.63">propaganda away from our children they</text>
  <text start="439.529" dur="4.2">their minds are not ready for it they</text>
  <text start="441.419" dur="3.72">cannot handle it they will fall prey to</text>
  <text start="443.729" dur="4.351">at ninety percent of the time</text>
  <text start="445.139" dur="4.77">at least to some degree and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="448.08" dur="3.629">damaging entire generations of children</text>
  <text start="449.909" dur="4.021">and then those children grow up to be</text>
  <text start="451.709" dur="6.35">the kind of idiots that we&amp;#39;re facing on</text>
  <text start="453.93" dur="7.68">the Left right now but that said</text>
  <text start="458.059" dur="10.51">privatize education far better quality</text>
  <text start="461.61" dur="9.389">far cheaper and far less prone and more</text>
  <text start="468.569" dur="4.95">resistant to this kind of propaganda</text>
  <text start="470.999" dur="4.14">okay this this stuff does not fly in the</text>
  <text start="473.519" dur="3.95">free market because people can choose</text>
  <text start="475.139" dur="4.8">other choices when you have one choice</text>
  <text start="477.469" dur="4.48">you get bad quality and you get</text>
  <text start="479.939" dur="5.37">corruption that&amp;#39;s always what happens</text>
  <text start="481.949" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m a voluntary / mint person</text>
  <text start="485.309" dur="4.801">I believe that the free market is</text>
  <text start="487.949" dur="3.87">probably the best way to regulate human</text>
  <text start="490.11" dur="3.899">behavior and that&amp;#39;s just you know my</text>
  <text start="491.819" dur="6.15">personal thought on it because you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="494.009" dur="6.72">really trust governments now another</text>
  <text start="497.969" dur="5.16">biggie is that Russia is claiming the</text>
  <text start="500.729" dur="4.89">u.s. they have information on the u.s.</text>
  <text start="503.129" dur="5.49">training Syrian militants to use false</text>
  <text start="505.619" dur="4.86">flag chemical attacks obviously the</text>
  <text start="508.619" dur="5.64">whole chemical attack thing in Syria has</text>
  <text start="510.479" dur="6.81">been BS from day one Assad was actually</text>
  <text start="514.259" dur="6.06">winning the war you know he was</text>
  <text start="517.289" dur="5.49">democratically elected he had no reason</text>
  <text start="520.319" dur="4.351">at all to use chemical weapons which is</text>
  <text start="522.779" dur="3.66">basically the own his own population</text>
  <text start="524.67" dur="4.2">which is basically the only thing that</text>
  <text start="526.439" dur="4.2">could have cost him that war is if like</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="4.019">the US and them came in to bomb him out</text>
  <text start="530.639" dur="2.831">of existence and how would they be able</text>
  <text start="532.889" dur="3.191">to do that</text>
  <text start="533.47" dur="4.92">well they would need a pretext and that</text>
  <text start="536.08" dur="3.84">would be chemical weapons oh he&amp;#39;s using</text>
  <text start="538.39" dur="2.79">chemical weapons on his own people we</text>
  <text start="539.92" dur="3.6">have to go stop him</text>
  <text start="541.18" dur="3.63">that is the kind of crap that they do we</text>
  <text start="543.52" dur="3.6">already knew that it was really the</text>
  <text start="544.81" dur="4.83">militants false flagging chemical</text>
  <text start="547.12" dur="5.49">attacks we&amp;#39;ve seen plenty of reports and</text>

  <text start="718.19" dur="4.14">mentioning if you aren&amp;#39;t familiar with</text>
  <text start="721.1" dur="4.32">some of the wonderful alternative</text>

  <text start="748.79" dur="5.88">like a 30-something percent success rate</text>
  <text start="751.07" dur="5.55">with that his drugs work very</text>

  <text start="763.73" dur="3.18">stop him forever</text>
  <text start="764.66" dur="4.17">he took it to congressional hearings to</text>
  <text start="766.91" dur="4.17">get the FDA to back off trying to put</text>
  <text start="768.83" dur="3.87">him in prison and to finally approve him</text>

  <text start="801.11" dur="4.65">Foundation for cure and how many of you</text>
  <text start="803.3" dur="4.29">have actually looked into where that</text>
  <text start="805.76" dur="5.43">money goes what percentage they keep</text>
  <text start="807.59" dur="5.78">rather than donate and what they do</text>
  <text start="811.19" dur="4.76">donate generally tends to go toward</text>

  <text start="838.51" dur="4.77">so this is not gonna come as a big</text>
  <text start="841.24" dur="4.95">surprise but you know more research</text>
  <text start="843.28" dur="4.44">worth looking into the Gerson treatment</text>
  <text start="846.19" dur="4.29">which is not just for cancer as from</text>
