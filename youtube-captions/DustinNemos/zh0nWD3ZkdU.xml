  <text start="62.44" dur="4.289">I&amp;#39;m going to show you that right here</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="4.42">where he says in his tweet earlier today</text>

  <text start="75.7" dur="7.04">these numbers past and present let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="83.73" dur="7.27">we have a pretty good breakdown of those</text>
  <text start="86.53" dur="11.1">right here so FBI past present one</text>

  <text start="114.76" dur="4.77">the least of their problems now this is</text>
  <text start="116.95" dur="7.53">obviously a at least I think a reference</text>
  <text start="119.53" dur="6.12">to Andrew McCabe being fired you know</text>
  <text start="124.48" dur="3.48">there are rumors that he will</text>
  <text start="125.65" dur="4.469">potentially soon be charged I mean Alex</text>
  <text start="127.96" dur="3.69">Jones has the video up saying Hillary</text>
  <text start="130.119" dur="4.561">Clinton to be arrested next or something</text>
  <text start="131.65" dur="5.19">like that like he actually predicts that</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="3.37">she is going to be on the chopping block</text>
  <text start="136.84" dur="3.64">sooner rather than</text>
  <text start="138.05" dur="4.8">later and the investigations gonna move</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="6.39">toward Clinton Foundation and arrests</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="6.75">soon let&amp;#39;s see I hope so for sure it may</text>
  <text start="146.87" dur="4.29">be premature to say that but you know if</text>
  <text start="149.6" dur="6.84">alex is seeing it I&amp;#39;m sure he has good</text>
  <text start="151.16" dur="7.35">reasons projection well they they</text>
  <text start="156.44" dur="5.28">project everything that they are guilty</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="5.82">of on everyone else obviously just like</text>
  <text start="161.72" dur="5.22">with Russia they did that Russia leads</text>
  <text start="164.33" dur="5.85">to Democrats and Hillary Rodham Clinton</text>
  <text start="166.94" dur="6.3">is what it says here</text>
  <text start="170.18" dur="5.49">Twitter BOTS lead to Google operated not</text>
  <text start="173.24" dur="6.27">Russia and it&amp;#39;s for a narrative and</text>
  <text start="175.67" dur="5.79">political worth mentioning I you know</text>
  <text start="179.51" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s no way to verify this at all so</text>
  <text start="181.46" dur="7.2">take it with a grain of salt it</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="11.07">definitely makes sense we have this post</text>
  <text start="188.66" dur="8.25">two days ago three 1518 on 4chan now</text>
  <text start="194.57" dur="4.62">this guy claims to be working for Google</text>
  <text start="196.91" dur="4.23">I if it was legitimate and they were</text>
  <text start="199.19" dur="3.78">really aware of what&amp;#39;s going on like if</text>
  <text start="201.14" dur="3.75">they were following q and on I imagine</text>
  <text start="202.97" dur="4.44">they would have posted on H an however</text>
  <text start="204.89" dur="4.53">if they really did work for Google they</text>
  <text start="207.41" dur="4.65">didn&amp;#39;t necessarily follow Q and on but</text>
  <text start="209.42" dur="6.36">they had heard that people on the boards</text>
  <text start="212.06" dur="6.63">were competing with their a you know</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="5.82">their BOTS and spreading our mean war</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="5.25">and such that we do then they would be</text>
  <text start="221.6" dur="5.31">aware enough to go post perhaps on 4chan</text>
  <text start="223.94" dur="5.01">to get an anonymous post out there and</text>
  <text start="226.91" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;m gonna read this it&amp;#39;s a little long</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="4.71">but I&amp;#39;m gonna read this because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="3.42">there&amp;#39;s two types of truth in the world</text>
  <text start="233.66" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s the there&amp;#39;s the vague and</text>
  <text start="235.34" dur="6.24">general truth so you might hear a story</text>
  <text start="238.4" dur="5.13">about how hilarious is corrupt and it</text>
  <text start="241.58" dur="3.33">may get some of the details wrong and</text>
  <text start="243.53" dur="3.209">that that&amp;#39;s what I would consider to be</text>
  <text start="244.91" dur="3.99">a general truth because we know that</text>
  <text start="246.739" dur="4.621">she&amp;#39;s corrupt through all of the</text>
  <text start="248.9" dur="4.02">preponderance of evidence but maybe that</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="2.82">maybe that particular story out of</text>
  <text start="252.92" dur="4.47">detail wrong and therefore is not</text>
  <text start="254.18" dur="6.54">specifically incorrect and then you have</text>
  <text start="257.39" dur="5.07">the specific truth so I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="260.72" dur="4.46">this is a specific truth I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="262.46" dur="6.66">that we can verify what he says however</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="5.5">Q also says that Google is behind it and</text>
  <text start="269.12" dur="2.74">this guy basically is admitting that</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="6.549">Google is behind</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="7.2">and the the bots the AI bots and if</text>
  <text start="277.229" dur="4.321">you&amp;#39;ve been following any of you to any</text>
  <text start="279.06" dur="4.68">of the people on Twitter you know</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="4.649">sometimes some of them will repost</text>
  <text start="283.74" dur="4.019">images where we have like a collection</text>
  <text start="286.199" dur="3.661">Julian Assange has done and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="287.759" dur="4.051">reposted that where he&amp;#39;ll show you like</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="4.29">20 30 different accounts all saying the</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="3.69">exact same thing retweeting what one</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="4.199">account says some of them are even</text>
  <text start="295.5" dur="5.34">verified sometimes so that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="298.349" dur="4.56">what this guy is describing in his and</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="4.139">his post and I feel like that is</text>
  <text start="302.909" dur="6.78">definitely a general truth we know that</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="8.15">there are AI bots spreading stuff on</text>
  <text start="309.689" dur="8.01">Twitter to try to create the illusion of</text>
  <text start="313.129" dur="5.5">majority consensus and you know I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="317.699" dur="2.9">gonna go ahead and read through here</text>
  <text start="318.629" dur="4.44">because he says it better than I can</text>
  <text start="320.599" dur="4.421">quote hello everyone this is my first</text>
  <text start="323.069" dur="3.87">time posting on 4chan but I need to get</text>
  <text start="325.02" dur="4.079">this out and I need to stay anonymous I</text>
  <text start="326.939" dur="3.78">work for Google I&amp;#39;m not going to name</text>
  <text start="329.099" dur="3.09">the internal tech department for obvious</text>
  <text start="330.719" dur="2.07">reasons I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to pinpoint</text>
  <text start="332.189" dur="4.051">Who I am</text>
  <text start="332.789" dur="6.481">but I&amp;#39;m in tech and I work with AI I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="336.24" dur="4.41">explain my team and I created AI bots</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="3.389">for Twitter these bots are slightly</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="4.139">different than regular AI bots these are</text>
  <text start="342.659" dur="4.111">remote signal BOTS but I&amp;#39;ll explain what</text>
  <text start="344.789" dur="4.35">they do my team and a human intelligence</text>
  <text start="346.77" dur="4.829">team which is really just a propaganda</text>
  <text start="349.139" dur="5.761">team work together to make certain</text>
  <text start="351.599" dur="6.091">topics trend and persuade public opinion</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="5.22">which persuades political pressure we do</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="4.68">this by a group think method we have a</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="4.669">name for it internally but consensus</text>
  <text start="362.37" dur="6.269">cracking is a more used name externally</text>
  <text start="364.789" dur="5.771">but the bots we created go to Twitter go</text>
  <text start="368.639" dur="3.87">into Twitter conversations and push a</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="4.289">narrative some of the bots are verified</text>
  <text start="372.509" dur="4.261">counts and they start by arguing a point</text>
  <text start="374.849" dur="3.6">of view against someone and then more</text>
  <text start="376.77" dur="3.239">bots join in and thumbs up the comment</text>
  <text start="378.449" dur="4.261">we are doing it with gun control now</text>
  <text start="380.009" dur="4.861">more people see a consensus of gun</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="4.169">control and people get on the people on</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="4.049">the fence get persuaded to our narrative</text>
  <text start="386.879" dur="3.6">and politicians get pressured by</text>
  <text start="388.919" dur="3.78">thinking it&amp;#39;s actual people</text>
  <text start="390.479" dur="4.201">we had whole meetings about 4chan</text>
  <text start="392.699" dur="4.231">because you guys specifically this board</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="3.87">are disrupting the bots you are</text>
  <text start="396.93" dur="4.079">basically doing what we are doing but</text>
  <text start="398.55" dur="4.709">you are real people we not necessarily</text>
  <text start="401.009" dur="4.741">mean devised a plan to knock you guys</text>
  <text start="403.259" dur="4.351">from Twitter we accuse Russia of doing</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="4.23">what we are doing and use the narrative</text>
  <text start="407.61" dur="4.77">to wipe out suspected BOTS which we knew</text>
  <text start="409.98" dur="4.29">weren&amp;#39;t BOTS at all I feel like</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="4.56">about this here&amp;#39;s the thing I&amp;#39;m actually</text>
  <text start="414.27" dur="4.29">a Democrat and I hate guns but I believe</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="3.93">in balance of the people more than</text>
  <text start="418.56" dur="4.11">anything we are using software as a</text>
  <text start="420.87" dur="3.93">political tool instead of the will of</text>
  <text start="422.67" dur="4.41">the people this is also a violation of</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="3.75">the SEC we are fabricating Twitter users</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="3.72">and using them for stocks and</text>
  <text start="428.55" dur="5.96">advertising I sign that I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="430.8" dur="3.71">discuss this so I need to stay anonymous</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="7.51">okay</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="9.909">that is also relevant to this projection</text>
  <text start="442.32" dur="5.7">here because they project Russian BOTS</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="3.511">on everyone that disagrees with them</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="4.32">which we knew that as an organized</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="6.54">campaign Twitter even messaged out like</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="6.12">over 700,000 people saying we suspect</text>
  <text start="456.72" dur="3.66">you or someone that you followed of</text>
  <text start="458.46" dur="3.69">being a Russian bot or something like</text>
  <text start="460.38" dur="3.24">that you know is really recent part of</text>
  <text start="462.15" dur="6.66">that big purge that happened when they</text>
  <text start="463.62" dur="7.41">banned me on YouTube and others now I</text>
  <text start="468.81" dur="5.31">just frankly I have to say it&amp;#39;s an honor</text>
  <text start="471.03" dur="4.74">to be banned by YouTube it really is it</text>
  <text start="474.12" dur="3.87">kind of made me it&amp;#39;s made my life more</text>
  <text start="475.77" dur="3.98">difficult but it also made my day that</text>
  <text start="477.99" dur="5.13">day I was really excited about it</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="5.169">because I knew that it meant I&amp;#39;m a I was</text>
  <text start="483.12" dur="6.27">making a difference in the world but</text>
  <text start="484.919" dur="8.101">continuing to continuing on here slant</text>
  <text start="489.39" dur="6.15">okay the Russian bot thing is and and</text>
  <text start="493.02" dur="7.17">the Google operated BOTS are for</text>
  <text start="495.54" dur="6.66">narrative and political slant but he</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="3.24">also has slant capitalized so I imagine</text>
  <text start="502.2" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s probably a double meaning there</text>
  <text start="503.43" dur="4.62">I don&amp;#39;t know Biden and China</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="9.05">alright Biden and China what what is</text>

  <text start="752.23" dur="7.33">obviously it&amp;#39;s not what the people want</text>
  <text start="755.33" dur="8.03">but if they get a majority or they get</text>
  <text start="759.56" dur="6.96">enough people in Congress they could try</text>
  <text start="763.36" dur="4.599">they could literally try to impeach</text>
  <text start="766.52" dur="4.069">POTUS which I think would lead to a</text>
  <text start="767.959" dur="5.13">civil war and that is not the ideal</text>
  <text start="770.589" dur="8.62">optimal situation we want to win without</text>
  <text start="773.089" dur="9.271">violence and bloodshed and I am a little</text>
  <text start="779.209" dur="5.37">concerned about the 25 percent of</text>

  <text start="803.67" dur="11.37">the biggest fear public awakening all</text>
  <text start="807.93" dur="11.82">right so obviously this you know stars</text>
  <text start="815.04" dur="6.9">are celebrities and and the political</text>
  <text start="819.75" dur="3.899">and peer pressure that power that they</text>

  <text start="1057.919" dur="4.591">just not worth it</text>
  <text start="1059.6" dur="5.13">if we don&amp;#39;t give them a significant</text>

  <text start="1073.85" dur="5.37">from doing the same thing so there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1077.63" dur="3.99">law of incentives that plays in to</text>
  <text start="1079.22" dur="5.49">evildoers folks and sociopaths</text>
  <text start="1081.62" dur="4.47">Psychopaths they&amp;#39;re not going to behave</text>

  <text start="1086.09" dur="2.4">they&amp;#39;re not going to behave because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1087.29" dur="3.39">moral they&amp;#39;re not gonna behave even</text>
  <text start="1088.49" dur="5.07">because people might get hurt at what</text>
  <text start="1090.68" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re doing and the ones like Hillary</text>
  <text start="1093.56" dur="2.55">Clinton</text>

  <text start="1099.65" dur="5.82">and wealth and you know they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1101.42" dur="5.85">keep doing that but we need incentives</text>
  <text start="1105.47" dur="5.49">and we need disincentives a disincentive</text>
  <text start="1107.27" dur="5.37">would be well last week some what he</text>
  <text start="1110.96" dur="3.72">doing really something similar to you</text>
  <text start="1112.64" dur="3.18">like maybe they&amp;#39;re involved in something</text>
  <text start="1114.68" dur="2.37">that could be considered treason or</text>
  <text start="1115.82" dur="2.28">maybe they&amp;#39;re hurting children or</text>
  <text start="1117.05" dur="4.32">something like that well they got the</text>
  <text start="1118.1" dur="10.56">death penalty a week ago and then even a</text>
  <text start="1121.37" dur="10.35">sociopath would think Oh hmm even a</text>
  <text start="1128.66" dur="5.61">psychopath would say but I might not</text>
  <text start="1131.72" dur="5.43">want to do that because even Psychopaths</text>
  <text start="1134.27" dur="4.8">still value their life they don&amp;#39;t have</text>

  <text start="1139.07" dur="9.06">still value their life so that&amp;#39;s that is</text>
  <text start="1144.83" dur="6.24">why I&amp;#39;m a fan of in this instance the</text>
  <text start="1148.13" dur="5.25">death penalty and I don&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="1151.07" dur="4.23">lightly I&amp;#39;m not a you know I believe in</text>
  <text start="1153.38" dur="4.44">the non-aggression principle so I am</text>
  <text start="1155.3" dur="4.29">completely against violence as a means</text>
  <text start="1157.82" dur="4.62">of aggression and force I am all for</text>
  <text start="1159.59" dur="5.25">violence as a means of self-defense so</text>
  <text start="1162.44" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s how voluntary is a little</text>
  <text start="1164.84" dur="6.15">separate from someone who may be</text>
  <text start="1167.15" dur="8.13">considered a pacifist because they won&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1179.27" dur="5.88">they would not defend their own child</text>
  <text start="1181.58" dur="8.43">because violence is wrong or they would</text>
  <text start="1185.15" dur="10.11">not kill an attacker because murder is</text>
  <text start="1190.01" dur="7.5">wrong and I&amp;#39;m afraid that just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1195.26" dur="2.91">coincide with what we know of human</text>
