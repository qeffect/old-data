  <text start="7.429" dur="10.481">good morning huge pleasure to be here I</text>
  <text start="12.059" dur="8.06">am I&amp;#39;m told that last night Brian hooker</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="6.32">did Love Shack</text>
  <text start="20.119" dur="4.111">did anyone did anyone see that</text>
  <text start="24.8" dur="11.11">did anyone film that that&amp;#39;s going in my</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="11.88">new movie what was I doing I would have</text>
  <text start="35.91" dur="8.899">given a lot to see that anti-vaxxers are</text>
  <text start="41.579" dur="7.381">still spreading false claims as people</text>
  <text start="44.809" dur="5.73">die of measles and they go so all your</text>
  <text start="48.96" dur="4.169">fault</text>
  <text start="50.539" dur="6.671">there&amp;#39;s the headline what is the truth</text>
  <text start="53.129" dur="6.891">behind that headline now it&amp;#39;s measles</text>
  <text start="57.21" dur="5.369">and measles measles all over the world</text>
  <text start="60.02" dur="8.349">that mandates are being forced through</text>
  <text start="62.579" dur="10.08">based upon this disease measles this</text>
  <text start="68.369" dur="8.911">killer disease let&amp;#39;s look at the history</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="7.231">of this I&amp;#39;ve studied measles since 1990</text>
  <text start="77.28" dur="5.94">I&amp;#39;m not preoccupied with measles as a</text>
  <text start="79.89" dur="6.57">cause of autism it&amp;#39;s a fascinating virus</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="7.62">particularly as a prototypic live viral</text>
  <text start="86.46" dur="8.22">vaccine but as I learn more I started</text>
  <text start="90.84" dur="5.819">off in the UK looking at MMR fact</text>
  <text start="94.68" dur="4.049">measles in the context of inflammatory</text>
  <text start="96.659" dur="5.701">bowel disease Crohn&amp;#39;s and Colitis but</text>
  <text start="98.729" dur="6.871">battle II MMR in the context of autism</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="4.95">because MMR was given in isolation and</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="3.72">mothers were able to say they were able</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="4.23">to pinpoint exactly what happened to</text>
  <text start="109.32" dur="4.439">their child it wasn&amp;#39;t given with other</text>
  <text start="111.54" dur="3.81">vaccines so they could say this is what</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="5.061">happened to my child</text>
  <text start="115.35" dur="7.199">I came to testified before Congress in</text>
  <text start="118.82" dur="7.39">2000 and I learned about mercury but I</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="5.58">thought no nobody would ever ever put</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="3.87">mercury into a child let alone their</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="4.681">worst enemy but I was of course wrong</text>
  <text start="130.08" dur="3.239">and then I learned about aluminum and</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="3.269">then I learned</text>
  <text start="133.319" dur="5.491">all the excipient sand the adventitious</text>
  <text start="136.079" dur="5.91">viruses and DNA and etc and it just went</text>
  <text start="138.81" dur="5.42">on and on so I&amp;#39;m not wedded to measles</text>
  <text start="141.989" dur="4.441">or MMR as a quarter of a cause of autism</text>
  <text start="144.23" dur="4.899">exclusively although I do believe it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="146.43" dur="5.899">very important factor but I studied</text>
  <text start="149.129" dur="5.881">measles because it teaches us so much</text>
  <text start="152.329" dur="5.8">about what has happened over time about</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="5.159">immunology about vaccinology and so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="158.129" dur="6.54">going to use it as a template not least</text>
  <text start="160.169" dur="10.49">of which is because the politicians the</text>
  <text start="164.669" dur="11.121">vaccinologist and the pro vaccine Lobby</text>
  <text start="170.659" dur="8.2">make this their flavor of the month and</text>
  <text start="175.79" dur="5.979">with this they want to force vaccination</text>
  <text start="178.859" dur="9.261">against a multitude of different</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="9.631">infectious agents not just measles so</text>
  <text start="188.12" dur="5.259">where did it start starts really in</text>
  <text start="191.4" dur="5.699">terms of a perception and understanding</text>
  <text start="193.379" dur="5.1">this is Louis Pasteur who was the really</text>
  <text start="197.099" dur="3.45">the founding father of modern</text>
  <text start="198.479" dur="4.521">vaccinology and this was the perception</text>
  <text start="200.549" dur="6.541">at the time and it comes down to</text>
  <text start="203" dur="6.609">perception how do we perceive our</text>
  <text start="207.09" dur="5.28">relationship with the microbe with the</text>
  <text start="209.609" dur="4.65">infectious agent and this has changed</text>
  <text start="212.37" dur="3.899">dramatically over the last 100 years</text>
  <text start="214.259" dur="5.73">this is what he said if it is a</text>
  <text start="216.269" dur="5.46">terrifying thought that life is at the</text>
  <text start="219.989" dur="5.941">mercy of the multiplication of these</text>
  <text start="221.729" dur="7.62">minut bodies it is a consoling hope that</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="8.729">science will not always remain powerless</text>
  <text start="229.349" dur="8.88">before such enemies enemies so in those</text>
  <text start="234.659" dur="7.021">days infection microbes were perceived</text>
  <text start="238.229" dur="5.85">as the enemy and indeed that was a</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="4.739">reasonable perception because things</text>
  <text start="244.079" dur="4.38">like neurosyphilis were major killers</text>
  <text start="246.419" dur="4.861">neurosyphilis was called the great pox</text>
  <text start="248.459" dur="6.471">if this was the great pox smallpox was</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="7.939">smallpox it was a major major killer</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="6.97">antibiotics transformed that disorder</text>
  <text start="259.219" dur="5.26">battlefield gangrene rheumatic fever all</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="4.17">of these conditions so infection was not</text>
  <text start="264.479" dur="2.461">unreasonably perceived at the time</text>
  <text start="266.07" dur="3.39">microbes</text>
  <text start="266.94" dur="6.03">were perceived as the enemy we now know</text>
  <text start="269.46" dur="5.72">of course in the modern era of the</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="6.77">microbiome that we are in fact</text>
  <text start="275.18" dur="7.51">nine-tenths bacteria one-tenth human</text>
  <text start="279.74" dur="5.19">that we depend for our very survival and</text>
  <text start="282.69" dur="5.91">have done for a very long time upon</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="6.58">microbes indeed the ability of</text>
  <text start="288.6" dur="6.18">single-celled organisms to develop into</text>
  <text start="291.51" dur="6.36">what are now complex multicellular multi</text>
  <text start="294.78" dur="7.02">organ humans and other mammals are</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="6.9">dependent upon bacteria getting into</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="5.78">cells and becoming mitochondria and</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="5.4">providing an energy source that allowed</text>
  <text start="307.58" dur="7.59">multicellular organisms to exist on this</text>
  <text start="310.17" dur="7.65">planet so when did this era start this</text>
  <text start="315.17" dur="4.6">saneras hospital my old alma mater</text>
  <text start="317.82" dur="4.95">September the 3rd my birthday there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="5.13">something uncanny about all of this dr.</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="3.93">Alexander Fleming as he was at the time</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="4.5">before he was knighted returned from his</text>
  <text start="326.7" dur="4.95">vacation to observe that there was a</text>
  <text start="329.4" dur="3.78">mold growing in some of the colonies</text>
  <text start="331.65" dur="5.01">that he had in petri dishes of</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="6.18">Staphylococcus and castor said that in</text>
  <text start="336.66" dur="4.68">the fields of observation chance favors</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="6.059">only the prepared mind that it was the</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="6.15">prepared mind of Alexander Fleming who</text>
  <text start="345.419" dur="5.511">picked up the observation that his mold</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="6.21">juice was capable of killing a number of</text>
  <text start="350.93" dur="6.42">different bacteria not simply</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="6.27">Staphylococcus and this laboratory</text>
  <text start="357.35" dur="5.8">observation was then translated by</text>
  <text start="359.97" dur="5.58">Florian chain at Oxford University into</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="7.85">the production the commercial production</text>
  <text start="365.55" dur="7.77">of penicillin and this in the 1940s</text>
  <text start="371" dur="4.96">antibiotics were the turning point in</text>
  <text start="373.32" dur="7.26">what was again perceived to be the war</text>
  <text start="375.96" dur="6.81">on infectious disease I say the outcomes</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="4.86">of diseases like syphilis battlefield</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="6.24">gangrene scarlet fever were completely</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="7.08">rewritten by antibiotics and so the</text>
  <text start="389.01" dur="5.67">rhetoric was this was a miracle this was</text>
  <text start="392.52" dur="4.62">a medical miracle this is the best thing</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="6.12">that medicine has ever done where we</text>
  <text start="397.14" dur="7.529">heard that of course we hear it now</text>
  <text start="400.8" dur="6.47">with vaccines debris paper it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="404.669" dur="6.15">very interesting every paper you read</text>
  <text start="407.27" dur="8.44">that dares to examine the safety of</text>
  <text start="410.819" dur="7.771">vaccines has to start there is an</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="4.799">obligatory opening statement that</text>
  <text start="418.59" dur="5.52">vaccines are the most wonderful thing</text>
  <text start="420.509" dur="4.851">that medicine has ever done that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="424.11" dur="4.529">science</text>
  <text start="425.36" dur="9.13">that&amp;#39;s not objective that&amp;#39;s simply an</text>
  <text start="428.639" dur="8.221">opinion with antibiotics in 80 years</text>
  <text start="434.49" dur="6.959">the miracle turned into something</text>
  <text start="436.86" dur="8.179">completely different it turned into what</text>
  <text start="441.449" dur="7.47">is now a disaster bacterial resistance</text>
  <text start="445.039" dur="7.841">principally due to suboptimal efficacy</text>
  <text start="448.919" dur="9.18">and microbial evolution has completely</text>
  <text start="452.88" dur="8.93">changed things so man in his hubris in</text>
  <text start="458.099" dur="7.051">his arrogance believed that his science</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="7.329">could outwit the collective intelligence</text>
  <text start="465.15" dur="5.94">of microorganisms these things are</text>
  <text start="469.139" dur="3.721">exquisitely intelligent they have a</text>
  <text start="471.09" dur="5.729">collective intelligence that will mean</text>
  <text start="472.86" dur="6.989">that they have this ability to adapt to</text>
  <text start="476.819" dur="6.451">change to mutate but above all to</text>
  <text start="479.849" dur="4.981">survive the evolutionary imperative is</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="3.63">that they will survive so if you give an</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="4.86">antibiotic that kills 95% of the</text>
  <text start="486.9" dur="6.389">bacteria but allows 5% to live it has a</text>
  <text start="489.69" dur="5.58">suboptimal efficacy then what you will</text>
  <text start="493.289" dur="5.791">have is the emergence of resistant</text>
  <text start="495.27" dur="6.78">strains and the next antibiotic will</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="5.97">kill 4% of the fighter 95% of those but</text>
  <text start="502.05" dur="5.519">you will still have those strains that</text>
  <text start="505.05" dur="7.169">evolve and become highly highly</text>
  <text start="507.569" dur="9.181">dangerous and that is what they refer to</text>
  <text start="512.219" dur="7.62">the public health officials not us not</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="6.3">me public health officials referred to</text>
  <text start="519.839" dur="6.601">this now as the era of the antibiotic</text>
  <text start="523.05" dur="5.19">apocalypse and the evolutionary</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="4.38">selection pressures that drove the</text>
  <text start="528.24" dur="4.95">development and such resistance has</text>
  <text start="530.82" dur="4.01">generated more dangerous pathogenic</text>
  <text start="533.19" dur="4.59">strains so what happened</text>
  <text start="534.83" dur="5.62">is that the pharmaceutical industry say</text>
  <text start="537.78" dur="4.02">we are not going to invest any further</text>
  <text start="540.45" dur="3.42">money in the production of new</text>
  <text start="541.8" dur="5.19">antibiotics why because they have</text>
  <text start="543.87" dur="4.62">already achieved resistance to our new</text>
  <text start="546.99" dur="4.77">antibiotic by the time we get it on the</text>
  <text start="548.49" dur="7.89">market so people you&amp;#39;re on your own</text>
  <text start="551.76" dur="6.75">and now hospital wards Hospital floors</text>
  <text start="556.38" dur="5.28">operating theaters hospitals themselves</text>
  <text start="558.51" dur="5.64">are having to be closed because of these</text>
  <text start="561.66" dur="7.95">highly pathogenic multi resistant</text>
  <text start="564.15" dur="7.65">bacteria that we in our arrogance and I</text>
  <text start="569.61" dur="4.08">say we were the capital W I mean</text>
  <text start="571.8" dur="5.22">principally the pharmaceutical industry</text>
  <text start="573.69" dur="7.35">I mean the medical profession have</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="5.97">allowed to occur and the quote from the</text>
  <text start="581.04" dur="4.32">public health authorities is the</text>
  <text start="582.99" dur="4.92">antibiotic apocalypse may already be</text>
  <text start="585.36" dur="5.16">upon us with an estimated 50,000 people</text>
  <text start="587.91" dur="5.04">dying every year in Europe and the US</text>
  <text start="590.52" dur="5.49">for infections that antibiotics have</text>
  <text start="592.95" dur="6.3">lost the power to treat the projected</text>
  <text start="596.01" dur="8.88">figures are much much worse so this is a</text>
  <text start="599.25" dur="8.67">lesson in the history of man&amp;#39;s war on</text>
  <text start="604.89" dur="4.98">infectious disease the end of modern</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="7.4">medicine that is how this is described</text>
  <text start="609.87" dur="10.25">our vaccines destined for a similar fate</text>
  <text start="615.32" dur="7.45">why not why not</text>

  <text start="647.97" dur="6.6">worked we layered assumptions upon</text>
  <text start="651.78" dur="5.22">assumptions and now find ourselves in</text>
  <text start="654.57" dur="4.68">the uncomfortable position of admitting</text>
  <text start="657" dur="6.32">that we may have made some crucial</text>

  <text start="663.32" dur="7.37">anti-vaxxers to blame</text>
  <text start="665.89" dur="6.81">one original prediction was predicted</text>
  <text start="670.69" dur="3.18">correct and I will come to that in a</text>
  <text start="672.7" dur="4.079">moment but there were certain</text>
  <text start="673.87" dur="4.77">predictions made in 1961 at a meeting of</text>
  <text start="676.779" dur="5.161">the National Institutes of Health where</text>
  <text start="678.64" dur="6.569">they first discussed mass measles</text>
  <text start="681.94" dur="4.86">vaccination and I&amp;#39;ll come to those in a</text>
  <text start="685.209" dur="2.971">minute but I just want to interject with</text>
  <text start="686.8" dur="7.68">this small thing that I actually put in</text>
  <text start="688.18" dur="8.58">just recently and that is that in 2015</text>
  <text start="694.48" dur="5.099">the prediction was that it would be easy</text>
  <text start="696.76" dur="6.06">to distinguish between the vaccine</text>
  <text start="699.579" dur="4.831">strain and the wild-type strains of</text>
  <text start="702.82" dur="3.959">measles virus this would happen very</text>
  <text start="704.41" dur="3.48">very quickly a simple laboratory test</text>
  <text start="706.779" dur="3">would become available</text>
  <text start="707.89" dur="4.53">where we could distinguish between these</text>
  <text start="709.779" dur="5.401">two it was one prediction that was</text>
  <text start="712.42" dur="5.46">actually somewhat correct although it</text>
  <text start="715.18" dur="5.73">didn&amp;#39;t happen immediately you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="717.88" dur="5.1">aware that in 2015 there was an outbreak</text>
  <text start="720.91" dur="6.179">of measles at Disneyland and what that</text>
  <text start="722.98" dur="7.62">allowed is for Senator pan to put</text>
  <text start="727.089" dur="8.301">pressure upon the California Legislature</text>
  <text start="730.6" dur="7.88">that led to the passage of SB 277 and</text>

  <text start="752.32" dur="4.67">isolates taken from people who had</text>
  <text start="754.449" dur="5.371">measles around the country including</text>
  <text start="756.99" dur="5.14">that outbreak in Disneyland and there</text>
  <text start="759.82" dur="5.28">were a hundred and ninety odd isolates</text>

  <text start="765.1" dur="4.32">isolates they chopped them up into their</text>

  <text start="769.42" dur="8.25">able to say whether they were vaccine</text>

  <text start="777.67" dur="5.22">of those cases diagnosed cases of</text>
  <text start="780.31" dur="6.209">measles were found to be caused by the</text>

  <text start="868.72" dur="5.38">getting the disease as a cause called by</text>
  <text start="872.12" dur="4.74">the vaccine itself but we are facing</text>
  <text start="874.1" dur="4.53">vaccine failure and the point of the</text>
  <text start="876.86" dur="4.38">entire point of this lecture is it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="878.63" dur="5.79">failure to vaccinate its vaccine failure</text>
  <text start="881.24" dur="5.25">that is the problem let me move on</text>
  <text start="884.42" dur="4.71">measles outbreak occurred in New York</text>
  <text start="886.49" dur="4.62">City all cases had prior evidence of</text>
  <text start="889.13" dur="4.38">measles immunity symptoms were</text>
  <text start="891.11" dur="6.69">consistent with measles the person who</text>
  <text start="893.51" dur="6.39">caused this had been had multiple</text>
  <text start="897.8" dur="4.5">vaccines the index patient that is the</text>
  <text start="899.9" dur="4.71">patient who started the infection of</text>
  <text start="902.3" dur="5.04">others in in New York had two doses of</text>
  <text start="904.61" dur="4.89">measles containing vaccines and four</text>
  <text start="907.34" dur="4.35">secondary cases were confirmed who had</text>
  <text start="909.5" dur="4.95">two doses of measles containing vaccines</text>
  <text start="911.69" dur="6.36">or measles antibodies so why did those</text>
  <text start="914.45" dur="7.44">measles antibodies not protect we will</text>
  <text start="918.05" dur="5.91">come to that so there are two elements</text>
  <text start="921.89" dur="5.67">to this problem one is that measles</text>
  <text start="923.96" dur="5.94">vaccine is itself causing measles and</text>
  <text start="927.56" dur="4.59">the second is that measles vaccine is</text>
  <text start="929.9" dur="3.58">not producing immunity that protects</text>
  <text start="932.15" dur="6.09">either against natural</text>
  <text start="933.48" dur="7.32">measles or the vaccine induced measles a</text>
  <text start="938.24" dur="6.01">vaccine failure is not simply an</text>
  <text start="940.8" dur="7.07">inconvenience it makes vaccines more</text>
  <text start="944.25" dur="7.519">dangerous a very good example is mumps</text>
  <text start="947.87" dur="6.909">mumps was a trivial disease in children</text>
  <text start="951.769" dur="5.411">it is not a trivial disease as you know</text>
  <text start="954.779" dur="4.62">in post pubertal males in particular it</text>
  <text start="957.18" dur="5.159">can lead to testicular inflammation and</text>
  <text start="959.399" dur="4.831">infertility because there is an epidemic</text>
  <text start="962.339" dur="6.451">of infertility are the two linked we</text>
  <text start="964.23" dur="7.62">don&amp;#39;t know if you have a vaccine that</text>
  <text start="968.79" dur="5.789">does not work there is primary failure</text>
  <text start="971.85" dur="4.5">because the vaccine doesn&amp;#39;t cause you to</text>
  <text start="974.579" dur="4.38">become immune when you&amp;#39;re exposed to it</text>
  <text start="976.35" dur="5.22">or secondary failure that immunity wears</text>
  <text start="978.959" dur="4.891">off very quickly or tertiary failure</text>
  <text start="981.57" dur="4.53">that no one wants to talk about and that</text>
  <text start="983.85" dur="4.41">is where you use subsequent generations</text>
  <text start="986.1" dur="4.26">of the original virus in the laboratory</text>
  <text start="988.26" dur="5.37">to produce the next generation of</text>
  <text start="990.36" dur="5.4">vaccines and over time that virus is not</text>
  <text start="993.63" dur="4.649">the original one that they isolated</text>
  <text start="995.76" dur="5.1">years ago it&amp;#39;s mutated and mutated and</text>
  <text start="998.279" dur="4.68">mutated and it&amp;#39;s no longer producing a</text>
  <text start="1000.86" dur="4.229">vaccine that&amp;#39;s protective and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1002.959" dur="5.61">nightmare so primary secondary and</text>
  <text start="1005.089" dur="6.69">tertiary vaccine failure then what you</text>
  <text start="1008.569" dur="4.89">do is you give people temporary immunity</text>
  <text start="1011.779" dur="3.93">or none at all and then they are</text>
  <text start="1013.459" dur="5.221">susceptible to measles sorry - mumps</text>
  <text start="1015.709" dur="5.07">when it is a more dangerous disease you</text>
  <text start="1018.68" dur="5.399">merely put off the problem and so mumps</text>
  <text start="1020.779" dur="5.55">vaccination has made mumps a more</text>
  <text start="1024.079" dur="3.691">dangerous disease it&amp;#39;s not simply that</text>
  <text start="1026.329" dur="4.711">it&amp;#39;s an inconvenience because it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1027.77" dur="7.47">work it is actually producing a more</text>
  <text start="1031.04" dur="6.48">dangerous disease so we need to</text>
  <text start="1035.24" dur="6.39">understand man&amp;#39;s relationship to measles</text>
  <text start="1037.52" dur="4.59">and how that is co-evolved fatal measles</text>
  <text start="1041.63" dur="1.98">cases</text>
  <text start="1042.11" dur="3.24">highlight the importance of herd</text>
  <text start="1043.61" dur="5.27">immunity so that I just want to dwell on</text>
  <text start="1045.35" dur="6.329">this notion of herd immunity it&amp;#39;s used</text>
  <text start="1048.88" dur="5.02">pan&amp;#39;s translated it with the help of</text>
  <text start="1051.679" dur="5.361">Paul Offit and others into community</text>
  <text start="1053.9" dur="3.14">immunity what an irritating</text>
  <text start="1058.45" dur="5.669">after kind of take a deep breath when I</text>
  <text start="1060.999" dur="6.691">say community immunity but the notion of</text>
  <text start="1064.119" dur="6.711">what herd immunity really is and I want</text>
  <text start="1067.69" dur="3.14">to talk about that now</text>
  <text start="1071.1" dur="6.399">before vaccination there was natural</text>
  <text start="1074.44" dur="6.119">herd immunity there&amp;#39;s an extremely</text>
  <text start="1077.499" dur="6.211">important division into the pre vaccine</text>
  <text start="1080.559" dur="5.911">era natural herd immunity and the</text>
  <text start="1083.71" dur="7.079">vaccine era this quasi herd immunity</text>
  <text start="1086.47" dur="6.959">that is now talked on so natural herd</text>
  <text start="1090.789" dur="5.161">immunity in the pre vaccine era this</text>
  <text start="1093.429" dur="6.33">clearly did not operate to prevent</text>
  <text start="1095.95" dur="5.849">measles infection indeed what it did</text>
  <text start="1099.759" dur="5.16">natural herd immunity at the population</text>
  <text start="1101.799" dur="5.521">level acted to permit infection to</text>
  <text start="1104.919" dur="6.63">encourage measles infection at a time</text>
  <text start="1107.32" dur="6.929">when it was least dangerous so measles</text>
  <text start="1111.549" dur="7.051">is most dangerous to infants under the</text>
  <text start="1114.249" dur="6.06">age of 1 presumably intuitively because</text>
  <text start="1118.6" dur="6.919">their immune system has yet to develop</text>
  <text start="1120.309" dur="8.791">fully and adults so what happened is</text>
  <text start="1125.519" dur="6.76">that natural herd immunity operated to</text>
  <text start="1129.1" dur="6.059">constrain the age of measles to</text>
  <text start="1132.279" dur="6.9">childhood when it was an increasingly</text>
  <text start="1135.159" dur="8.97">trivial disease and that led to an</text>
  <text start="1139.179" dur="6.48">extraordinary effect and that was this</text>
  <text start="1144.129" dur="3.721">and you&amp;#39;ve seen this graph but if you</text>
  <text start="1145.659" dur="5.7">take nothing else away from this talk</text>
  <text start="1147.85" dur="5.84">this is the most extraordinary example</text>
  <text start="1151.359" dur="4.68">of natural herd immunity in operation</text>
  <text start="1153.69" dur="5.109">this is from the UK but I could show you</text>
  <text start="1156.039" dur="5.311">this same graph from any developed</text>
  <text start="1158.799" dur="4.47">country that collected measles data over</text>
  <text start="1161.35" dur="4.86">a protracted period but you can see that</text>
  <text start="1163.269" dur="5.671">in 1920 measles is a major killer of</text>
  <text start="1166.21" dur="4.649">children during epidemics 1,200 per</text>
  <text start="1168.94" dur="3.869">million children dying during epidemics</text>
  <text start="1170.859" dur="4.77">and then there was this extraordinary</text>
  <text start="1172.809" dur="7.291">the specific as fall in case fatality</text>
  <text start="1175.629" dur="5.79">rate to the point where by the time the</text>
  <text start="1180.1" dur="4.259">single measles vaccine had been</text>
  <text start="1181.419" dur="6">introduced there had been a 99.9 six</text>
  <text start="1184.359" dur="3.99">percent reduction in case fatality now</text>
  <text start="1187.419" dur="3.651">people will say well that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1188.349" dur="6.591">mortality what about the disease itself</text>
  <text start="1191.07" dur="6.3">mortality is the worst end of the</text>
  <text start="1194.94" dur="4.41">severity of morbidity the experiencing</text>
  <text start="1197.37" dur="4.2">of the disease itself so this is a very</text>
  <text start="1199.35" dur="5.16">good proxy for measles getting milder</text>
  <text start="1201.57" dur="6.78">and milder and milder death is just the</text>
  <text start="1204.51" dur="7.53">worst outcome so measles was becoming a</text>
  <text start="1208.35" dur="5.13">dramatically milder disease now the</text>
  <text start="1212.04" dur="3.03">first question you might ask is well</text>
  <text start="1213.48" dur="3.03">what would have happened if we&amp;#39;d never</text>
  <text start="1215.07" dur="3.72">intervene with vaccination</text>
  <text start="1216.51" dur="4.59">looking at this graph Lily it would have</text>
  <text start="1218.79" dur="3.87">continued to approach zero there would</text>
  <text start="1221.1" dur="4.47">have been no mortality at all</text>
  <text start="1222.66" dur="4.92">measles would be an extremely mild</text>
  <text start="1225.57" dur="3.78">disease but of course we can&amp;#39;t say what</text>
  <text start="1227.58" dur="3.51">happened would have happened because we</text>
  <text start="1229.35" dur="4.56">intervened and all the benefit of this</text>
  <text start="1231.09" dur="6.6">is ascribed to vaccination when that is</text>
  <text start="1233.91" dur="5.7">totally inappropriate so one of the</text>
  <text start="1237.69" dur="4.86">questions is why why did we see this</text>
  <text start="1239.61" dur="6.18">extraordinary fall in case fatality rate</text>
  <text start="1242.55" dur="4.62">and there are two key elements to herd</text>
  <text start="1245.79" dur="3.26">immunity and I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1247.17" dur="4.53">nutrition I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1249.05" dur="3.94">improve standard of living I can get</text>
  <text start="1251.7" dur="3.69">into that talk about that for a long</text>
  <text start="1252.99" dur="5.46">time but I wanted do well upon two key</text>
  <text start="1255.39" dur="5.49">elements and that is that a single</text>
  <text start="1258.45" dur="4.59">exposure to natural measles led to life</text>
  <text start="1260.88" dur="4.05">long immunity and this came from an</text>
  <text start="1263.04" dur="5.25">observation by a doctor called Parnham</text>
  <text start="1264.93" dur="5.64">who went to the Faroe Islands and Island</text>
  <text start="1268.29" dur="6.15">populations the Pharos a north of</text>
  <text start="1270.57" dur="6.09">Scotland there are owned by Denmark and</text>
  <text start="1274.44" dur="3.9">the thing about these discrete isolated</text>
  <text start="1276.66" dur="4.62">island populations is certainly before</text>
  <text start="1278.34" dur="5.33">the Second World War they had a unique</text>
  <text start="1281.28" dur="5.27">pattern of epidemics you had to</text>
  <text start="1283.67" dur="5.38">reintroduce the infection from outside</text>
  <text start="1286.55" dur="4.96">into the population to cause another</text>
  <text start="1289.05" dur="6.3">epidemic because the population was too</text>
  <text start="1291.51" dur="8.31">small to sustain an endemic level of</text>
  <text start="1295.35" dur="8.61">disease so these islands experienced</text>
  <text start="1299.82" dur="6.81">epidemics perhaps every 70 years and</text>
  <text start="1303.96" dur="4.38">what Parnham observed is when he went</text>
  <text start="1306.63" dur="4.14">there and observed a measles epidemic</text>
  <text start="1308.34" dur="5.49">the only people who didn&amp;#39;t get measles</text>
  <text start="1310.77" dur="6.15">were people over 70 who&amp;#39;d been alive</text>
  <text start="1313.83" dur="5.37">during the previous epidemic and so you</text>
  <text start="1316.92" dur="4.35">had this observation that since been</text>
  <text start="1319.2" dur="5.719">substantiated that one exposure to</text>
  <text start="1321.27" dur="7.109">measles led to lifelong protect</text>
  <text start="1324.919" dur="6.401">the other is passive maternal immunity</text>
  <text start="1328.379" dur="4.86">and that is the ability of mothers</text>
  <text start="1331.32" dur="4.77">who&amp;#39;ve been infected with natural</text>
  <text start="1333.239" dur="4.89">measles to confer excellent</text>
  <text start="1336.09" dur="4.649">transpersonal and breast milk immunity</text>
  <text start="1338.129" dur="4.86">to their babies to protect them during</text>
  <text start="1340.739" dur="6.27">that first year of life that critical</text>
  <text start="1342.989" dur="6.871">first year of life and so these two</text>
  <text start="1347.009" dur="5.221">elements a single exposure of me to</text>
  <text start="1349.86" dur="4.169">measles in childhood leading to lifelong</text>
  <text start="1352.23" dur="5.49">immunity and therefore preventing you</text>

  <text start="1364.669" dur="5.86">protecting babies and therefore measles</text>
  <text start="1367.859" dur="5.67">was getting a milder and milder disease</text>
  <text start="1370.529" dur="4.5">and graphically but this is the kind of</text>
  <text start="1373.529" dur="4.08">thing this is the frequency the</text>
  <text start="1375.029" dur="5.49">percentage of cases that these two</text>

  <text start="1400.289" dur="2.88">that one exposure led to lifelong</text>
  <text start="1401.909" dur="3.6">immunity and protection and good</text>
  <text start="1403.169" dur="5.041">maternal immunity so there are two</text>
  <text start="1405.509" dur="5.88">benefits right off the bat and that led</text>
  <text start="1408.21" dur="5.549">to this and this is an extraordinary</text>
  <text start="1411.389" dur="5.13">consequence of natural herd immunity</text>
  <text start="1413.759" dur="5.67">what an amazing example nothing will</text>
  <text start="1416.519" dur="6.811">ever emulate will ever reproduce this</text>

  <text start="1423.33" dur="7.169">is where we were going up to the 1960s</text>
  <text start="1427.669" dur="5.38">one of the questions a very reasonable</text>
  <text start="1430.499" dur="5.851">question is would it have been safer</text>

  <text start="1696.86" dur="4.71">the child who dies that merits further</text>
  <text start="1699.05" dur="4.17">study so rather than focus of on mass</text>
  <text start="1701.57" dur="3.27">vaccination should we not ask the</text>

  <text start="1715.01" dur="5.13">understand that not to do further study</text>
  <text start="1717.71" dur="4.8">would be unethical and of course those</text>
  <text start="1720.14" dur="4.17">further studies were never done Enders</text>
  <text start="1722.51" dur="2.93">the man who&amp;#39;d actually isolated the</text>
  <text start="1724.31" dur="4.95">virus itself</text>
  <text start="1725.44" dur="7.45">also said a measles vaccine is desirable</text>

  <text start="1739.31" dur="5.88">vaccine ologists of course won the day</text>

  <text start="1769.79" dur="5.91">by a different route different strain</text>

  <text start="1775.7" dur="6.48">measles and the virus louse</text>
  <text start="1779.8" dur="3.97">they said that there would be protection</text>

  <text start="1783.77" dur="4.44">this vaccine that like natural immunity</text>
  <text start="1786.71" dur="3.54">it would be lifelong there would be no</text>
  <text start="1788.21" dur="4.89">permanent brain damage injury or death</text>
  <text start="1790.25" dur="6.24">measles would be certainly and rapidly</text>
  <text start="1793.1" dur="5.97">eradicated using this vaccine the</text>
  <text start="1796.49" dur="4.65">vaccine virus could not be shed from the</text>
  <text start="1799.07" dur="3.27">vaccinated to the unvaccinated and there</text>
  <text start="1801.14" dur="5.28">would be no need for mandatory</text>
  <text start="1802.34" dur="10.8">vaccination which of these promises have</text>
  <text start="1806.42" dur="11.54">been kept not a single one not a single</text>

  <text start="1820.58" dur="7.59">promises made by these people no none</text>
  <text start="1824.63" dur="6.36">whatsoever so the early observations</text>
  <text start="1828.17" dur="4.26">after vaccination is that nine seventies</text>
  <text start="1830.99" dur="5.25">and eighties there were outbreaks of</text>
  <text start="1832.43" dur="7.86">measles in school-age children in</text>
  <text start="1836.24" dur="7.32">age-appropriate children children in</text>
  <text start="1840.29" dur="4.86">whom the disease was mild and this</text>
  <text start="1843.56" dur="3.54">accounted for the majority and wouldnt</text>
  <text start="1845.15" dur="4.65">Bernal have described this but of even</text>
  <text start="1847.1" dur="5.1">amongst that group 42% had been</text>
  <text start="1849.8" dur="4.91">vaccinated against measles itself and</text>
  <text start="1852.2" dur="6.21">you see this you see this dramatic fall</text>
  <text start="1854.71" dur="6.91">in the number of reported cases of</text>
  <text start="1858.41" dur="6.18">Olsson this is in the us in blue and in</text>
  <text start="1861.62" dur="5.61">Mexico in green and then you see this</text>
  <text start="1864.59" dur="5.13">honeymoon period where measles appears</text>
  <text start="1867.23" dur="4.71">to be very low in terms of the number of</text>
  <text start="1869.72" dur="5.25">reported cases and then there is this</text>
  <text start="1871.94" dur="5.25">resurgence after that honeymoon period</text>
  <text start="1874.97" dur="4.17">and it&amp;#39;s that resurgence that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1877.19" dur="5.52">now of great interest</text>
  <text start="1879.14" dur="6.08">so beyond that in 1989 there were a</text>
  <text start="1882.71" dur="5.73">hundred and seventy outbreaks in the US</text>
  <text start="1885.22" dur="5.32">and that was up from forty to fifty per</text>
  <text start="1888.44" dur="5.4">year and this increased through the</text>
  <text start="1890.54" dur="6.39">1990s now the majority of children who</text>
  <text start="1893.84" dur="6.33">were getting hit were school-age and</text>
  <text start="1896.93" dur="5.58">college aged students in other words we</text>
  <text start="1900.17" dur="5.22">saw the beginnings of a displacement in</text>
  <text start="1902.51" dur="6.54">the age of infection it had gone from</text>
  <text start="1905.39" dur="7.2">childhood now into college age children</text>
  <text start="1909.05" dur="6.2">and 80% of these were appropriately</text>

  <text start="1919.36" dur="5.8">vaccine immunity to measles</text>
  <text start="1921.68" dur="5.19">there was a prolific outbreak in those</text>

  <text start="1935.72" dur="6.63">promises that it would produce immunity</text>
  <text start="1938.99" dur="4.59">in all children was wrong and it</text>
  <text start="1942.35" dur="6.75">certainly wasn&amp;#39;t going to produce</text>
  <text start="1943.58" dur="8.31">immunity for life later there was an 89</text>
  <text start="1949.1" dur="4.8">91 epidemic and now we had a different</text>
  <text start="1951.89" dur="5.1">pattern of disease there was a dramatic</text>
  <text start="1953.9" dur="5.34">shift from older children to preschool</text>
  <text start="1956.99" dur="5.64">children to younger children and it was</text>
  <text start="1959.24" dur="6.18">highest in children under 1 and this</text>
  <text start="1962.63" dur="4.32">then became dangerous this then became</text>
  <text start="1965.42" dur="3.68">dangerous because what we didn&amp;#39;t know at</text>
  <text start="1966.95" dur="5.22">the time is that mothers who&amp;#39;d had</text>
  <text start="1969.1" dur="5.5">vaccination did not give give the good</text>
  <text start="1972.17" dur="5.19">immunity to their babies at all so</text>
  <text start="1974.6" dur="5.79">babies under 1 were now vulnerable to</text>
  <text start="1977.36" dur="7.56">measles and that is when mortality was</text>
  <text start="1980.39" dur="6.93">going to be greatest so what we saw is</text>
  <text start="1984.92" dur="5.57">exactly that death rates were highest in</text>
  <text start="1987.32" dur="3.17">the younger children</text>

  <text start="2162.79" dur="3.93">the intensity of exposure by virtue of</text>
  <text start="2164.86" dur="3.39">whether you shared a room you got</text>
  <text start="2166.72" dur="4.08">infected at home whether you shared a</text>

  <text start="2170.8" dur="4.38">barrier of vaccine induced immunity</text>
  <text start="2173.14" dur="3.09">whether you&amp;#39;d have three vaccines it</text>
  <text start="2175.18" dur="4.14">didn&amp;#39;t make any difference</text>
  <text start="2176.23" dur="5.37">you got measles so when siblings shared</text>
  <text start="2179.32" dur="3.93">a bedroom where they were gonna get a</text>
  <text start="2181.6" dur="3.3">very high intensity of exposure they</text>
  <text start="2183.25" dur="3.24">slept together and they were coughing</text>
  <text start="2184.9" dur="3.84">over each other all night long they got</text>
  <text start="2186.49" dur="5.13">a massive dose of viral exposure then</text>
  <text start="2188.74" dur="5.64">there was a 78% risk of measles observed</text>
  <text start="2191.62" dur="6.42">in those who had been multiple evacuated</text>
  <text start="2194.38" dur="4.59">and here&amp;#39;s a really interesting story</text>
  <text start="2198.04" dur="3.57">right now</text>
  <text start="2198.97" dur="4.86">now I didn&amp;#39;t realize this but this comes</text>
  <text start="2201.61" dur="5.19">from a blood transfusion unit a group</text>
  <text start="2203.83" dur="5.37">down in Boca and what they were doing is</text>
  <text start="2206.8" dur="4.26">they were preparing intravenous</text>
  <text start="2209.2" dur="5.13">immunoglobulin to give to people with</text>
  <text start="2211.06" dur="6.81">primary immunodeficiency who needed</text>
  <text start="2214.33" dur="6.9">protection against measles and what they</text>
  <text start="2217.87" dur="5.46">found is that over the years their</text>
  <text start="2221.23" dur="4.04">donors could no longer give them blood</text>
  <text start="2223.33" dur="5.84">samples from which they could extract</text>
  <text start="2225.27" dur="9.25">IVIG that had antibody against meals</text>
  <text start="2229.17" dur="7.66">this vaccinated population no longer met</text>
  <text start="2234.52" dur="5.07">the FDA requirements for neutralizing</text>
  <text start="2236.83" dur="4.17">antibody against meal virus so they</text>
  <text start="2239.59" dur="2.93">couldn&amp;#39;t use them they had nothing to</text>
  <text start="2241" dur="3.18">give these people with primary</text>
  <text start="2242.52" dur="3.52">immunodeficiency in the face a</text>
  <text start="2244.18" dur="4.44">vaccination I bear in mind what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2246.04" dur="5.36">told about is the immune deficient so</text>
  <text start="2248.62" dur="2.78">here&amp;#39;s another irony</text>
  <text start="2251.5" dur="6.97">so what they did is they said okay</text>
  <text start="2255.13" dur="5.35">let&amp;#39;s give them a booster vaccine before</text>
  <text start="2258.47" dur="3.75">we take their blood and see if we can</text>
  <text start="2260.48" dur="4.29">boost their level of neutralizing</text>
  <text start="2262.22" dur="4.47">antibody isolated and extract it and</text>
  <text start="2264.77" dur="4.35">then meet FDA requirements and they</text>
  <text start="2266.69" dur="5.31">didn&amp;#39;t they didn&amp;#39;t come close what it</text>
  <text start="2269.12" dur="4.68">led to was a doubling of the</text>
  <text start="2272" dur="4.29">neutralizing antibody titer the key</text>
  <text start="2273.8" dur="5.49">protective antibody titer but that</text>
  <text start="2276.29" dur="5.01">wasn&amp;#39;t anywhere near enough and in a</text>
  <text start="2279.29" dur="4.31">very short time a hundred and odd days</text>
  <text start="2281.3" dur="6.78">all of that antibody had disappeared</text>
  <text start="2283.6" dur="7.54">back to baseline that would mean that</text>
  <text start="2288.08" dur="7.26">you would have to have 3 plus doses of</text>
  <text start="2291.14" dur="8.1">measles vaccine per year for life to</text>
  <text start="2295.34" dur="5.64">protect you against measles so I would</text>
  <text start="2299.24" dur="3.84">buy stock in Merck if I were you that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2300.98" dur="5.94">gonna that&amp;#39;s ooh that&amp;#39;s a surefire</text>
  <text start="2303.08" dur="5.55">winner but the problem is there are</text>
  <text start="2306.92" dur="3.21">diminishing returns and every time you</text>
  <text start="2308.63" dur="2.25">do it it gets lower and lower and lower</text>
  <text start="2310.13" dur="4.4">and lower</text>
  <text start="2310.88" dur="10.68">it&amp;#39;s an absolute complete and utter</text>
  <text start="2314.53" dur="9.76">failure so let me just show you a graph</text>
  <text start="2321.56" dur="5.22">which is really concerning this is a</text>
  <text start="2324.29" dur="7.53">graph of successive birth cohorts so</text>
  <text start="2326.78" dur="8.07">people born in 1930s right up to people</text>
  <text start="2331.82" dur="6.12">born in the 1990s and it looks at the</text>
  <text start="2334.85" dur="6.09">level of neutralizing antibody in the</text>
  <text start="2337.94" dur="5.04">blood of those individuals and before</text>
  <text start="2340.94" dur="4.08">you see the dotted lines the vertical</text>
  <text start="2342.98" dur="4.35">dotted lines the first one when the</text>
  <text start="2345.02" dur="4.77">single vaccine came in the second one</text>
  <text start="2347.33" dur="5.82">when the booster dose came in and you</text>
  <text start="2349.79" dur="6.42">see the neutralizing antibody titers in</text>
  <text start="2353.15" dur="5.37">those groups of people of different ages</text>
  <text start="2356.21" dur="4.71">and what you see is that those who got</text>
  <text start="2358.52" dur="5.94">natural measles had very very high</text>
  <text start="2360.92" dur="7.04">levels of protective antibody and this</text>
  <text start="2364.46" dur="7.89">has dropped to nothing</text>
  <text start="2367.96" dur="7.65">despite booster vaccination we now have</text>
  <text start="2372.35" dur="6.84">a population who are no longer protected</text>
  <text start="2375.61" dur="6.56">against this virus and that is</text>
  <text start="2379.19" dur="6.899">terrifying because now</text>
  <text start="2382.17" dur="7.47">what happens is we become the Yanomami</text>
  <text start="2386.089" dur="7.151">we become that virgin soil population</text>
  <text start="2389.64" dur="6.629">who are vulnerable very vulnerable to</text>
  <text start="2393.24" dur="7.26">measles should we fear it should we fear</text>
  <text start="2396.269" dur="9.661">measles absolutely why because of what</text>
  <text start="2400.5" dur="11.309">we have done the natural infection but</text>
  <text start="2405.93" dur="8.54">what man has done in his desire to exert</text>
  <text start="2411.809" dur="5.671">dominion and to profit from this agent</text>
  <text start="2414.47" dur="5.41">so we&amp;#39;ve talked about primary secondary</text>
  <text start="2417.48" dur="4.349">vaccine failure these are things that</text>
  <text start="2419.88" dur="4.649">are not discussed what is discussed is</text>
  <text start="2421.829" dur="5.19">people like you who may have hesitancy</text>
  <text start="2424.529" dur="5.01">about vaccinating it&amp;#39;s the anti-vaxxers</text>
  <text start="2427.019" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;ve got left to blame but</text>
  <text start="2429.539" dur="7.56">they know the truth the smart ones know</text>
  <text start="2432.809" dur="7.77">the truth and they know we are in a</text>
  <text start="2437.099" dur="5.161">powerless situation sooner or later we</text>
  <text start="2440.579" dur="4.381">must all sit down to a feast of</text>
  <text start="2442.26" dur="4.559">consequences one interesting observation</text>
  <text start="2444.96" dur="5.159">is that we&amp;#39;ve encouraged this in the way</text>
  <text start="2446.819" dur="5.55">we produce the vaccine itself so with</text>
  <text start="2450.119" dur="5.43">natural measles you develop this balance</text>
  <text start="2452.369" dur="4.831">between humoral immunity the production</text>
  <text start="2455.549" dur="5.371">of antibody which protects you from</text>
  <text start="2457.2" dur="5.129">extracellular virus the virus that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2460.92" dur="3.54">floating around in the blood when you</text>
  <text start="2462.329" dur="3.69">initially get infected antibodies will</text>
  <text start="2464.46" dur="3.809">protect they will bind to that and they</text>
  <text start="2466.019" dur="4.26">will neutralize it but you also need</text>
  <text start="2468.269" dur="4.08">cellular immunity because the virus gets</text>
  <text start="2470.279" dur="4.8">into cells and that&amp;#39;s where it</text>
  <text start="2472.349" dur="5.791">reproduces before it is again released</text>
  <text start="2475.079" dur="6.901">into the blood so you need these two</text>
  <text start="2478.14" dur="6.78">things set up at the same time that</text>
  <text start="2481.98" dur="5.96">produce lifelong immunity but the way</text>
  <text start="2484.92" dur="6.119">that we produce now the rash of measles</text>
  <text start="2487.94" dur="4.929">it&amp;#39;s not a side effect what it is is the</text>
  <text start="2491.039" dur="4.711">beginning of healing from measles it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2492.869" dur="6.72">the cellular immune response killing</text>
  <text start="2495.75" dur="6.029">virally infected cells so the rash is a</text>
  <text start="2499.589" dur="5.131">marker of the beginning of healing from</text>
  <text start="2501.779" dur="6.151">measles but the way you produce the</text>
  <text start="2504.72" dur="4.889">vaccine is you look at blood from people</text>
  <text start="2507.93" dur="3.96">who&amp;#39;ve been exposed to various strains</text>
  <text start="2509.609" dur="4.381">of the virus and you say they&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="2511.89" dur="4.05">highest antibodies that&amp;#39;s what we want</text>
  <text start="2513.99" dur="3.78">so you are biasing</text>
  <text start="2515.94" dur="5.13">towards this side of the immune response</text>
  <text start="2517.77" dur="5.91">what&amp;#39;s called the th2 immune response</text>
  <text start="2521.07" dur="5.97">and what that does is produce an</text>
  <text start="2523.68" dur="5.4">imbalance where you have an inadequate</text>
  <text start="2527.04" dur="3.93">induction of the cellular immune</text>
  <text start="2529.08" dur="5.52">response and that is vital for lifelong</text>
  <text start="2530.97" dur="5.43">immunity you produce a vaccine which</text>
  <text start="2534.6" dur="4.5">doesn&amp;#39;t cause a rash because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2536.4" dur="5.07">perceived to be an adverse reaction but</text>
  <text start="2539.1" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s actually what you want to see so</text>
  <text start="2541.47" dur="5.88">by virtue of the way in which we make</text>
  <text start="2543.57" dur="6.75">vaccines against meals we are biasing it</text>
  <text start="2547.35" dur="5.31">towards an excessive antibody response</text>
  <text start="2550.32" dur="6">but a deficient cellular immune response</text>
  <text start="2552.66" dur="5.34">and that isn&amp;#39;t adequate and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2556.32" dur="4.47">what&amp;#39;s been happening and the problem</text>
  <text start="2558" dur="5.01">with this is we know from studies of</text>
  <text start="2560.79" dur="4.65">viruses like hepatitis C amongst others</text>
  <text start="2563.01" dur="5.73">is that if you have a defective cellular</text>
  <text start="2565.44" dur="5.28">immune response then you encourage the</text>
  <text start="2568.74" dur="6.27">evolution of what are called escaped</text>
  <text start="2570.72" dur="6.93">mutants of the virus mutants of the</text>
  <text start="2575.01" dur="6.6">virus that are no longer susceptible to</text>
  <text start="2577.65" dur="6.87">the immunity produced by the vaccine and</text>
  <text start="2581.61" dur="7.71">that is not a situation you want to</text>
  <text start="2584.52" dur="7.26">encourage measles isn&amp;#39;t a single thing</text>
  <text start="2589.32" dur="5.61">either in a natural infection or in a</text>
  <text start="2591.78" dur="5.79">vaccine it&amp;#39;s a swarm of quasi species</text>
  <text start="2594.93" dur="4.08">that have various differences of the</text>
  <text start="2597.57" dur="3.36">genetic level and behavioral level</text>
  <text start="2599.01" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;ll be a dominant strain amongst</text>
  <text start="2600.93" dur="5.37">them that that becomes say the vaccine</text>
  <text start="2603" dur="7.83">strain but there are multiple mutations</text>
  <text start="2606.3" dur="7.59">amongst them and among that swarm there</text>
  <text start="2610.83" dur="5.91">may be a virus a quasi species that is</text>
  <text start="2613.89" dur="5.79">capable not only of eluding the immunity</text>
  <text start="2616.74" dur="6.98">from the vaccine but producing a very</text>
  <text start="2619.68" dur="6.39">severe disease the fact that measles is</text>
  <text start="2623.72" dur="5.08">infecting and spreading among those with</text>
  <text start="2626.07" dur="5.96">vaccine induced immunity means that this</text>
  <text start="2628.8" dur="5.52">wall must have been breached already I</text>
  <text start="2632.03" dur="2.61">talked about the Yanomami and there they</text>
  <text start="2634.32" dur="2.58">are</text>
  <text start="2634.64" dur="4.45">escape mutants and a virgin soil</text>
  <text start="2636.9" dur="4.47">population an escaped mutant that eludes</text>

  <text start="3006.97" dur="4.92">that goes with that is that if we act</text>
  <text start="3009.07" dur="4.49">appropriately and promptly and deal with</text>
  <text start="3011.89" dur="5.01">this then we will allow nature to</text>

  <text start="3117.94" dur="10.06">we&amp;#39;ve calculated that six vaccines are</text>

  <text start="3132.77" dur="7.77">being if you have an A mutation that</text>
  <text start="3138.08" dur="5.79">leads to a nonsynonymous substitution in</text>

  <text start="3143.87" dur="5.42">those details have worked out six of</text>
  <text start="3146.57" dur="5.4">them have expired on their shelf</text>
  <text start="3149.29" dur="6.67">evolutionarily so I&amp;#39;d like to actually</text>
  <text start="3151.97" dur="5.84">combine forces and give my data to you</text>
  <text start="3155.96" dur="7.89">and talk about it and see if we have a</text>
  <text start="3157.81" dur="7.93">message here about a ticking shelf-life</text>
  <text start="3163.85" dur="4.2">the idea of a shelf-life or a vaccine</text>
  <text start="3165.74" dur="5.25">they should have known and they did</text>
  <text start="3168.05" dur="5.88">there was a publication in in 1961 that</text>
  <text start="3170.99" dur="4.13">said in 2022 unless you update the</text>

  <text start="3181.67" dur="2.37">like to send that to you is that all</text>
  <text start="3182.81" dur="3.71">right absolutely</text>
  <text start="3184.04" dur="2.48">thank you</text>
  <text start="3186.77" dur="9.72">oh sorry my voice is lost</text>
  <text start="3194.48" dur="5.01">you mentioned the escaped mutants of the</text>
  <text start="3196.49" dur="6.24">measles virus due to the vaccination my</text>
  <text start="3199.49" dur="5.82">children are unvaccinated thank God the</text>
  <text start="3202.73" dur="4.35">does this escape mutant do these escape</text>
  <text start="3205.31" dur="3.69">mutants effect only vaccinated</text>
  <text start="3207.08" dur="4.2">individuals or is like a super virus</text>
  <text start="3209" dur="4.65">that&amp;#39;s now formed as a result of these</text>
  <text start="3211.28" dur="4.92">like you know that&amp;#39;s a very good</text>
  <text start="3213.65" dur="5.55">question so if you let&amp;#39;s just take an</text>
  <text start="3216.2" dur="5.25">example if this D for mutant of measles</text>
  <text start="3219.2" dur="3.78">virus becomes the dominant strain and</text>
  <text start="3221.45" dur="5.28">alludes to the immunity produced by the</text>
  <text start="3222.98" dur="6.33">vaccine what will happen to those who</text>
  <text start="3226.73" dur="5.94">have never been infected or vaccinated</text>
  <text start="3229.31" dur="5.61">and you might argue and nobody knows but</text>
  <text start="3232.67" dur="4.41">you might argue that in those</text>
  <text start="3234.92" dur="4.86">circumstances you are far better off</text>
  <text start="3237.08" dur="4.8">getting natural infection will which</text>
  <text start="3239.78" dur="4.95">will produce this monotypic response</text>
  <text start="3241.88" dur="6.239">which may include immunity to that</text>
  <text start="3244.73" dur="8.46">mutant D 4 strain that will protect you</text>
  <text start="3248.119" dur="6.961">lifelong rather than the known risk of</text>
  <text start="3253.19" dur="4.11">being vaccinated and having vaccine</text>
  <text start="3255.08" dur="6.63">immunity whatever that is that does not</text>
  <text start="3257.3" dur="6.6">protect you from this D 4 mutant so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3261.71" dur="5.06">an entirely legitimate question it&amp;#39;s far</text>
  <text start="3263.9" dur="6.36">too soon to know there will be I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="3266.77" dur="5.71">reluctance to even consider it what</text>
  <text start="3270.26" dur="7.04">going back to natural measles to protect</text>
  <text start="3272.48" dur="7.08">people for life but that seems to be</text>
  <text start="3277.3" dur="5.14">something that must be on the cards</text>
  <text start="3279.56" dur="9.63">right now if this D 4 mutant becomes the</text>
  <text start="3282.44" dur="11.55">dominant strain thank you my question is</text>
  <text start="3289.19" dur="6.99">in regards to your slide for primary</text>
  <text start="3293.99" dur="4.65">immunodeficiency I actually have primary</text>
  <text start="3296.18" dur="5.189">immunodeficiency I need immunoglobulin</text>
  <text start="3298.64" dur="5.219">twice a month and it&amp;#39;s extremely</text>
  <text start="3301.369" dur="4.321">concerning that it&amp;#39;s not going to be an</text>
  <text start="3303.859" dur="2.971">effective product anymore we already</text>
  <text start="3305.69" dur="3.48">have a problem where there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3306.83" dur="4.02">nationwide shortage and people can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3309.17" dur="3.33">even get their product at all and</text>
  <text start="3310.85" dur="3.24">knowing that it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like</text>
  <text start="3312.5" dur="2.97">there&amp;#39;s gonna be blood donors that are</text>
  <text start="3314.09" dur="3.21">even going to be able to produce</text>
  <text start="3315.47" dur="4.47">something to protect people like me is</text>
  <text start="3317.3" dur="3.21">very scary is there anything that can be</text>
  <text start="3319.94" dur="5.22">done</text>
  <text start="3320.51" dur="6.36">rectify that situation it&amp;#39;s a real</text>
  <text start="3325.16" dur="3.81">dilemma isn&amp;#39;t it I mean what we need to</text>
  <text start="3326.87" dur="3.54">do is protect our older generation</text>
  <text start="3328.97" dur="7.11">who&amp;#39;ve had natural measles and take</text>
  <text start="3330.41" dur="7.71">their blood regularly my father had</text>
  <text start="3336.08" dur="4.41">measles he&amp;#39;s had months rubella he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3338.12" dur="2.91">completely fine yeah and he would give</text>
  <text start="3340.49" dur="3.03">you</text>
  <text start="3341.03" dur="3.99">we saw the levels of neutralizing</text>
  <text start="3343.52" dur="4.41">antibody and people of this generation</text>
  <text start="3345.02" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m sure and but what do we do in the</text>
  <text start="3347.93" dur="3.06">long term and immaturely</text>
  <text start="3348.86" dur="3.75">AB Greg Poland from the Mayo Clinic has</text>
  <text start="3350.99" dur="4.38">said there is an urgent need to produce</text>
  <text start="3352.61" dur="5.13">a new measles vaccine and he said that</text>
  <text start="3355.37" dur="7.47">knowing without saying it but knowing</text>
  <text start="3357.74" dur="7.62">all of this and I think that that policy</text>
  <text start="3362.84" dur="4.38">is not going to service either what do</text>
  <text start="3365.36" dur="3.78">we do to be produce a Frankenstein</text>
  <text start="3367.22" dur="5.04">vaccine that gets away from live viral</text>
  <text start="3369.14" dur="5.43">vaccines that is a sort of one virus</text>
  <text start="3372.26" dur="4.29">piggybacked on the genome of another no</text>
  <text start="3374.57" dur="4.14">did you see what happened to the dengue</text>
  <text start="3376.55" dur="5.49">virus experiment that was conducted in</text>
  <text start="3378.71" dur="6.05">Indonesia of them which led to an</text>
  <text start="3382.04" dur="5.79">extraordinary rate of adverse reactions</text>
  <text start="3384.76" dur="5.92">per tracted lifelong adverse reactions</text>
  <text start="3387.83" dur="4.76">using one of those Frankenstein vaccines</text>
  <text start="3390.68" dur="9.74">so I don&amp;#39;t believe that&amp;#39;s an answer</text>
  <text start="3392.59" dur="12.88">either I think I don&amp;#39;t have an answer</text>
  <text start="3400.42" dur="7.96">something I have thought about and I I</text>
  <text start="3405.47" dur="5.64">appreciate that but I&amp;#39;m really tired of</text>
  <text start="3408.38" dur="4.95">hearing constantly people saying how</text>
  <text start="3411.11" dur="4.53">that everybody should get vaccinated to</text>
  <text start="3413.33" dur="4.79">protect the immunocompromised I&amp;#39;m scared</text>
  <text start="3415.64" dur="4.65">every time there&amp;#39;s one of these media</text>
  <text start="3418.12" dur="4.27">blitzes that everybody&amp;#39;s gonna go out</text>
  <text start="3420.29" dur="4.35">they&amp;#39;re gonna go get their MMR and be</text>
  <text start="3422.39" dur="4.14">shedding titers all over the place for</text>
  <text start="3424.64" dur="3.63">six weeks and possibly infect and kill</text>
  <text start="3426.53" dur="3.84">me so that&amp;#39;s right now that this is</text>
  <text start="3428.27" dur="4.44">captures the entire irony of the</text>
  <text start="3430.37" dur="3.87">situation is that they quote time and</text>
  <text start="3432.71" dur="3.63">again those who can&amp;#39;t get vaccinated</text>
  <text start="3434.24" dur="3.54">because of immunodeficiency but this</text>
  <text start="3436.34" dur="4.53">lady and people like her have been</text>
  <text start="3437.78" dur="6.42">rendered vulnerable now to measles virus</text>
  <text start="3440.87" dur="5.34">precisely because of vaccination and</text>
  <text start="3444.2" dur="5.07">they need to understand that yeah I</text>
  <text start="3446.21" dur="5.49">sorry tear you a nice yes thank you dr.</text>
  <text start="3449.27" dur="4.32">Wakefield I personally came from the</text>
  <text start="3451.7" dur="5.28">generation that got a few vaccines</text>
  <text start="3453.59" dur="6.51">Elementary School I got the MMR and then</text>
  <text start="3456.98" dur="6.84">I got a booster in college so I have the</text>
  <text start="3460.1" dur="5.82">fake immunity I&amp;#39;m just curious</text>
  <text start="3463.82" dur="5.34">since I do believe what you&amp;#39;re saying is</text>
  <text start="3465.92" dur="8.28">true what can we who have been</text>
  <text start="3469.16" dur="7.29">vaccinated what can we do do we need to</text>
  <text start="3474.2" dur="4.65">have like massive doses of vitamin A on</text>
  <text start="3476.45" dur="4.32">hand at all at all times just in case</text>
  <text start="3478.85" dur="4.98">like what what will happen is someone</text>
  <text start="3480.77" dur="4.71">like me I&amp;#39;ve already got some issues to</text>
  <text start="3483.83" dur="2.97">begin with if I were to get a measles</text>
  <text start="3485.48" dur="3.6">infection as you said it&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="3486.8" dur="4.17">dangerous in adults so we need to be</text>
  <text start="3489.08" dur="3.84">prepared there needs to be some sort of</text>
  <text start="3490.97" dur="4.32">education on how to treat measles</text>
  <text start="3492.92" dur="4.89">because it looks like we&amp;#39;re gonna have a</text>
  <text start="3495.29" dur="4.8">resurgence of it in the vaccinated and</text>
  <text start="3497.81" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;m just curious how what should they do</text>
  <text start="3500.09" dur="2.97">I think you&amp;#39;re absolutely right I think</text>
  <text start="3501.47" dur="4.14">the what we&amp;#39;ve learned from this meeting</text>
  <text start="3503.06" dur="4.83">over the years over the generations and</text>
  <text start="3505.61" dur="5.28">meetings like it is that if you prepare</text>
  <text start="3507.89" dur="5.28">the body with ways in which to protect</text>
  <text start="3510.89" dur="4.23">its own health then you can overcome</text>
  <text start="3513.17" dur="4.41">these things and so I would do exactly</text>
  <text start="3515.12" dur="4.77">as you say vitamin A is a classic</text>
  <text start="3517.58" dur="3.81">example of how we can prevent mortality</text>
  <text start="3519.89" dur="2.94">and morbidity from this disease and</text>
  <text start="3521.39" dur="3.42">there are many many others and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
