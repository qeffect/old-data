  <text start="201.58" dur="3.81">what does that have to do with Biden</text>
  <text start="202.87" dur="4.23">well of course the context here and the</text>
  <text start="205.39" dur="3.42">reason the Democrats are pulling this</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="3.51">impeachment card which they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="3.51">they do not have the ability to pull it</text>

  <text start="218.86" dur="4.02">emotional and manipulative poll that</text>
  <text start="220.87" dur="3.869">they normally have that&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="222.88" dur="4.38">because President Trump has has</text>
  <text start="224.739" dur="4.641">repeatedly exposed their Democratic</text>
  <text start="227.26" dur="4.71">playbook and and their fake news</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="4.84">emotional manipulation techniques we can</text>
  <text start="231.97" dur="4.44">get into that right now with the global</text>
  <text start="234.22" dur="3.81">warming girl but anyway let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="236.41" dur="5.1">back into the impeachment stuff I mean</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="5.04">this is an attempt to dethrone a sitting</text>
  <text start="241.51" dur="5.339">president of the United States of</text>
  <text start="243.07" dur="6.57">America for this sort of covering your</text>
  <text start="246.849" dur="4.681">own tracks and taking power back</text>
  <text start="249.64" dur="3.66">open coup d&amp;#39;etat on our government</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re trying to overthrow our</text>
  <text start="253.3" dur="4.559">government they&amp;#39;re trying to overthrow</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="5.61">our president and how does Biden link in</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="4.711">to that well the triggering point was</text>
  <text start="260.56" dur="4.62">his corruption being exposed one of</text>
  <text start="262.57" dur="5.88">their inner circle going down Oh No</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="5.37">so rather than take it as a loss rather</text>
  <text start="268.45" dur="4.14">than accept that you know he may</text>
  <text start="270.55" dur="3.36">actually have committed many crimes and</text>
  <text start="272.59" dur="3.45">should face justice for it</text>
  <text start="273.91" dur="3.33">they are gonna try to attack President</text>
  <text start="276.04" dur="4.17">Trump once again</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="5.1">to hide their own corruption and it gets</text>
  <text start="280.21" dur="5.25">it gets better so we have a lot more</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="5.4">than just that we also have Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="285.46" dur="4.5">over here let me turn off that crazy</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="5.04">phone thought already did sorry we have</text>
  <text start="289.96" dur="4.56">Joe Biden specifically setting up the</text>
  <text start="292.78" dur="3.56">scenario for meeting between the top</text>
  <text start="294.52" dur="5.25">Ukrainian officials and his son</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="4.06">basically weeks before and it does not</text>
  <text start="299.77" dur="4.14">look good</text>
  <text start="300.4" dur="7.05">so it errant Lee he was trying to set up</text>
  <text start="303.91" dur="8.55">the I guess the the board if you will</text>
  <text start="307.45" dur="7.35">for Ukraine to invest in natural gas and</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="4.38">expanding the natural gas operations and</text>
  <text start="314.8" dur="4.08">using American companies and all this</text>
  <text start="316.84" dur="4.079">other stuff but then his son comes along</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="4.58">and starts getting a nearly $200,000 a</text>
  <text start="320.919" dur="6.151">month check despite having no real</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="6.31">experience or connection to Ukraine or</text>
  <text start="327.07" dur="5.61">natural gas or and we go into China with</text>
  <text start="329.77" dur="5.07">that 1.5 billion as well so you know</text>
  <text start="332.68" dur="4.23">Ukraine was chump change I mean that was</text>
  <text start="334.84" dur="3.84">just to pay the travel expenses to go</text>
  <text start="336.91" dur="5.009">get the the real money which was over in</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="5.37">China I guess and we know how it&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="341.919" dur="4.711">we know why our country has has fallen</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="4.65">so far from its heights because these</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="6.63">monsters have taken power and sold us</text>
  <text start="348.7" dur="6.51">out spread spread America&amp;#39;s legs for the</text>
  <text start="353.26" dur="5.88">entire country or the entire world I</text>
  <text start="355.21" dur="5.76">should say to take advantage of and you</text>
  <text start="359.14" dur="4.62">know President Trump came along and said</text>
  <text start="360.97" dur="4.62">no more so you know we have this all</text>
  <text start="363.76" dur="6.09">over Hannity I mean this is a top show</text>
  <text start="365.59" dur="7.38">in the country anity and they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="369.85" dur="4.379">about Joe Biden in his scenario when he</text>
  <text start="372.97" dur="3.24">was setting his son up for all this</text>
  <text start="374.229" dur="3.421">money and then you know he&amp;#39;s also if</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;ve watched Hannity lately he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="377.65" dur="5.07">into Biden on China even I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="379.45" dur="5.499">not holding any punches this is amazing</text>
  <text start="382.72" dur="3.12">not that one we&amp;#39;ll talk about that on</text>
  <text start="384.949" dur="4.591">the other show</text>
  <text start="385.84" dur="5.859">so the Joe Biden stuff here calls for</text>
  <text start="389.54" dur="3.99">Trump impeachment after Trump calls out</text>
  <text start="391.699" dur="6.44">Biden family money-laundering operation</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="7.41">of course so we have Joe Biden&amp;#39;s son</text>
  <text start="398.139" dur="4.571">exposed we have Biden exposed you know</text>
  <text start="400.94" dur="3.9">they were involved in this together and</text>
  <text start="402.71" dur="6.87">then President Trump calling it out and</text>
  <text start="404.84" dur="6.359">suddenly oh my gosh Biden is so upset</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="2.91">his heads exploding he&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="411.199" dur="2.731">you&amp;#39;re asking the wrong court you need</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="3.39">to ask the right questions is what he</text>
  <text start="413.93" dur="4.47">said you need to look into President</text>
  <text start="415.88" dur="3.659">Trump and blah blah blah because and he</text>
  <text start="418.4" dur="3.18">was he wasn&amp;#39;t making a very good</text>
  <text start="419.539" dur="4.35">argument at that point either when he</text>
  <text start="421.58" dur="5.19">was being kind of asked on camera but he</text>
  <text start="423.889" dur="5.071">was reacting you could tell he was angry</text>
  <text start="426.77" dur="6.39">you could tell he was lashing out you</text>
  <text start="428.96" dur="7.829">could tell he was fearful so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.16" dur="6.509">almost to that point now where President</text>
  <text start="436.789" dur="4.561">Trump can get these people arrested even</text>
  <text start="439.669" dur="3.631">high-level members because they came</text>
  <text start="441.35" dur="4.71">after him for so long people are so</text>
  <text start="443.3" dur="5.67">angry and so many people are awake that</text>
  <text start="446.06" dur="5.4">we have the political way to do it we</text>
  <text start="448.97" dur="5.129">can arrest people like Joe Biden Barack</text>
  <text start="451.46" dur="3.72">Obama himself Hillary Clinton all of</text>
  <text start="454.099" dur="3.211">them who were involved in these</text>
  <text start="455.18" dur="5.7">treasonous things we can actually get on</text>
  <text start="457.31" dur="6.06">this guy the sign guys because because</text>
  <text start="460.88" dur="4.11">the Overton Window because the shift</text>
  <text start="463.37" dur="3.9">that has happened because the Great</text>
  <text start="464.99" dur="3.84">Awakening and remember that the qyn on</text>
  <text start="467.27" dur="3.54">movement has you know whatever you</text>
  <text start="468.83" dur="4.83">believe about it has massive influence</text>
  <text start="470.81" dur="5.13">among the the magum movement and it has</text>
  <text start="473.66" dur="5.16">helped to advance this cause of this</text>
  <text start="475.94" dur="4.44">help to wake a lot of people up so you</text>
  <text start="478.82" dur="4.44">know we have helped to destroy the fake</text>
  <text start="480.38" dur="6.42">news credibility for the mainstream</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="7.56">masses and and that that has made all</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="6.299">the difference so we also have let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="490.82" dur="3.9">I mean he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s really going into them</text>
  <text start="493.099" dur="3.481">on the UN situation as well and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="494.72" dur="3.629">cover that in a different video I wanted</text>
  <text start="496.58" dur="3.33">you guys to basically be aware of some</text>
  <text start="498.349" dur="4.85">of the stuff with Biden specifically</text>
  <text start="499.91" dur="6.27">because it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s at that point</text>
  <text start="503.199" dur="4.571">where all of their presidential</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="3.539">candidates are falling apart their</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="4.139">campaigns are falling apart the only</text>
  <text start="509.719" dur="4.351">point that that has anything to actually</text>
  <text start="511.909" dur="4.44">run on I mean we can go back over here a</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="5.279">little bit to Tulsi Gabbard</text>
  <text start="516.349" dur="5.011">I mean actually I think it was there we</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="3.661">got smaller one so we can go to tulsi</text>
  <text start="521.36" dur="3.99">gabbard over here who&amp;#39;s saying the right</text>
  <text start="523.01" dur="4.889">things in many cases but you know she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="525.35" dur="4.799">probably just either I can&amp;#39;t tell at</text>
  <text start="527.899" dur="6.24">this point if she&amp;#39;s a leftist ploy to</text>
  <text start="530.149" dur="5.461">and I think she is - to try to act kind</text>
  <text start="534.139" dur="5.45">of mainstream and get that sort of</text>
  <text start="535.61" dur="6.2">middle ground vote that that sort of</text>
  <text start="539.589" dur="4.451">nonpartisan even vote that that</text>
  <text start="541.81" dur="4.719">independent vote trying to swing some of</text>
  <text start="544.04" dur="3.06">that off and she&amp;#39;s very popular among</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="2.071">the left</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="3.27">she&amp;#39;s polling very well they don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="548.6" dur="3.75">like to kick her out of stuff so maybe</text>
  <text start="550.37" dur="4.909">that&amp;#39;s the case maybe she&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="552.35" dur="5.25">moderate voice in a crazy left world but</text>
  <text start="555.279" dur="4.391">I&amp;#39;m starting to think maybe she&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="557.6" dur="4.52">Republican like posing as a Democrat</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="5.25">just a mess with them I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="562.12" dur="4.779">because she&amp;#39;s actually defending at the</text>
  <text start="564.92" dur="4.44">worst possible time for her party</text>
  <text start="566.899" dur="3.69">freedom of speech from the attack so he</text>
  <text start="569.36" dur="2.669">isn&amp;#39;t that interesting and as you know</text>
  <text start="570.589" dur="4.591">she&amp;#39;s got a lawsuit against some things</text>
  <text start="572.029" dur="5.191">like that so um Biden back to then back</text>
  <text start="575.18" dur="4.23">to the point Biden is falling apart</text>
  <text start="577.22" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t remember stuff he&amp;#39;s incriminating</text>
  <text start="579.41" dur="4.38">himself with his own statements the same</text>
  <text start="581.18" dur="3.63">things like yeah yeah Brian well he was</text>
  <text start="583.79" dur="3.15">if I don&amp;#39;t remember the quote but he was</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="4.079">bragging about how he forced the</text>
  <text start="586.94" dur="3.54">prosecutor in Ukraine to be fired or</text>
  <text start="588.889" dur="2.911">they weren&amp;#39;t getting up the money you</text>
  <text start="590.48" dur="2.849">know and he was sitting there bragging</text>
