  <text start="101.009" dur="4.201">promoting carbon dioxide I&amp;#39;ve promoted</text>
  <text start="103.35" dur="3.99">carbon dioxide in the past if you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="3.839">a small greenhouse and you can afford a</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="3.209">little bit of the carbon dioxide gas I</text>

  <text start="124.14" dur="3.72">charge of this world have always tried</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="4.56">to turn everything against itself so</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="4.26">they will take away water and tell you</text>

  <text start="135.06" dur="5.34">do anything that they can to just invert</text>
  <text start="136.95" dur="5.19">reality in this case they took away one</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="3.3">of the main building blocks of life and</text>

  <text start="145.59" dur="6">complete opposite and it&amp;#39;s a source of</text>
  <text start="147.629" dur="5.311">life on this planet so this is the kind</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="3.149">of people that we&amp;#39;re dealing with they</text>
  <text start="152.94" dur="4.049">do it for profit they do it for control</text>
  <text start="154.739" dur="3.631">they do it for chaos and many of them</text>
  <text start="156.989" dur="2.67">are psychopaths and they do it just</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="3.209">because they want to set us against each</text>
  <text start="159.659" dur="5.041">other and make it easier to dominate us</text>
  <text start="161.579" dur="5.52">all it&amp;#39;s always been that way it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="3.539">it&amp;#39;s pretty much the the main course of</text>
  <text start="167.099" dur="3.181">human history it&amp;#39;s not all that</text>
  <text start="168.239" dur="4.351">conspiracy theory if you think about it</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s just history if you actually have a</text>
  <text start="172.59" dur="4.44">little bit of history as context these</text>
