  <text start="106.47" dur="4.44">this is Trump&amp;#39;s country especially here</text>
  <text start="108.15" dur="4.29">in Florida where she was but this shows</text>
  <text start="110.91" dur="4.98">you the state of morale on the Left</text>
  <text start="112.44" dur="7.5">they&amp;#39;ve really pushed the the the hate</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="6.66">the fear the the peak insanity that you</text>
  <text start="119.94" dur="5.19">you see on the fake news non-stop for</text>
  <text start="122.55" dur="3.84">years now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s affecting people</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="3.269">it&amp;#39;s especially affecting the</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="4.229">low-hanging fruit people on the Left</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="4.56">especially who are who are increasingly</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="4.171">in a dark world that&amp;#39;s closing it around</text>
  <text start="132.959" dur="3.421">them and they just don&amp;#39;t see all of the</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="4.2">good because they&amp;#39;re told that it&amp;#39;s evil</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="4.5">and they&amp;#39;re pushed with hate and look I</text>
  <text start="138.99" dur="3.78">feel bad for some of these people look I</text>
  <text start="140.88" dur="4.89">don&amp;#39;t feel as bad as I would if it were</text>
  <text start="142.77" dur="5.25">a truly like mentally disturbed person</text>
  <text start="145.77" dur="4.11">that just randomly stabbed themselves</text>
  <text start="148.02" dur="3.75">and it something like that like that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="3.66">little bit worse in my mind but clearly</text>
  <text start="151.77" dur="4.439">this is someone who&amp;#39;s disturbed enough</text>
  <text start="153.54" dur="4.47">to out of hate for for president Trump</text>
  <text start="156.209" dur="3.901">hurt themselves in some way which it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="158.01" dur="4.199">kinda hard to feel bad for them but at</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="3.87">the same point this this is a victim of</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="3.841">the fake news and nothing more this is</text>
  <text start="163.98" dur="4.37">somebody who who maybe shouldn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="5.159">necessarily be around the kitchen knife</text>
  <text start="168.35" dur="6.13">you know at laugh or cry because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.209" dur="4.891">that sad in this situation and maybe the</text>
  <text start="174.48" dur="3.93">family should have gotten to this person</text>
  <text start="176.1" dur="4.02">before they decided to do this and I</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t know what kind of condition</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re gonna end up being in I mean</text>
  <text start="181.38" dur="5.76">blood was pouring from the wounds when</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="6.359">police responded and look this is the</text>
  <text start="187.14" dur="4.92">kind of freaking out and panicking that</text>
  <text start="189.959" dur="3.991">can get people hurt and unfortunately a</text>
  <text start="192.06" dur="4.59">lot of folks in left are starting to see</text>
  <text start="193.95" dur="4.56">that and like I said and I&amp;#39;m not you</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="4.559">know I&amp;#39;m not trying to rub it in on this</text>
  <text start="198.51" dur="4.74">particular person but like I said as the</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="4.981">impeachment breaks down morale breaks</text>
  <text start="203.25" dur="6.48">down and whether the Democrats are crazy</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="6.45">or whether the Democrats are weak either</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="4.95">way it will come out and everyone will</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="3.99">see it so either they&amp;#39;re too weak to</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="5.49">impeach em or they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re just out</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="5.85">to get him so either way this battle is</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="3.75">gonna be decided very soon a lot of</text>
  <text start="222.48" dur="2.55">people on the Left are not liking how</text>
  <text start="223.92" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s going for them there</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="5.01">losing badly the impeachment attempt in</text>
  <text start="227.16" dur="4.76">fact they&amp;#39;ve already lost about half of</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="3.96">the number that they need in terms of</text>
  <text start="231.92" dur="4.39">again the low-hanging fruit on the</text>
  <text start="234" dur="4.23">Democrat side in the actual house in</text>
  <text start="236.31" dur="3.69">order to even pass this in the house so</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="3.63">you know they needed I think eighteen</text>
  <text start="240" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;ve lost about nine or at least</text>
  <text start="241.86" dur="6.12">those nine are wobbling already in</text>
  <text start="244.77" dur="4.799">contested elections so they want to vote</text>
  <text start="247.98" dur="3.479">for impeachment at the risk of pissing</text>
  <text start="249.569" dur="4.551">off Trump&amp;#39;s pace and losing their seat</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="5.011">next election that&amp;#39;s the risk that</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="5.47">around almost thirty of them have to</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="5.22">decide and we only need nine more or so</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="4.92">I think until we can stop that right</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="6.24">there anyway so I&amp;#39;m continuing on to the</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="6.81">next topic hunter Biden&amp;#39;s baby mama</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="4.95">London Roberts will get to grill Biden</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="3.48">under oath about money he made from burr</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="4.71">isthmus so you know I mentioned this</text>
  <text start="274.8" dur="5.58">recently in a different report but she</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="4.29">is taking him she&amp;#39;s a she&amp;#39;s a alright</text>
  <text start="280.38" dur="3.06">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s say what it is she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="2.759">probably a prostitute but she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="3.96">definitely a stripper that&amp;#39;s how they</text>
  <text start="284.639" dur="4.261">met and after you know they did the</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="4.14">thing which I&amp;#39;m not saying involved</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="6.18">money but she was a stripper</text>
  <text start="291.54" dur="5.46">right so you know maybe prostitute now</text>
  <text start="295.08" dur="4.589">she wants child support she decided to</text>
  <text start="297" dur="5.039">keep the child and this from Biden who</text>
  <text start="299.669" dur="4.141">was in the past and we&amp;#39;ve also reported</text>
  <text start="302.039" dur="3.391">on this threatened women to have an</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="4.35">abortion or he would go after their life</text>
  <text start="305.43" dur="5.13">who just destroyed this woman&amp;#39;s life</text>
  <text start="308.16" dur="3.93">this other lady this asian lady I came</text>
  <text start="310.56" dur="3.59">in burning off the top of my head had</text>
  <text start="312.09" dur="3.99">multiple children had a family business</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="3.76">multi-generational family business lost</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="4.89">it all because she decided to get</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="5.819">involved with Hunter Biden now this</text>
  <text start="320.97" dur="4.56">particular woman and of course there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="323.729" dur="3.301">lot of infidelity and cheating and crack</text>
  <text start="325.53" dur="3.12">pipes and everything else and and</text>
  <text start="327.03" dur="3.57">recently he was in a different strip</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="4.53">club with a different set of crack pipes</text>
  <text start="330.6" dur="5.37">and and there were sex objects involved</text>
  <text start="333.18" dur="4.65">and it&amp;#39;s a complicated mess really at</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="3.84">this point but kind of all of that</text>
  <text start="337.83" dur="3.87">context brings us around here to where</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="4.65">this particular stripper and maybe</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="6.21">prostitute decides to go after him for</text>
  <text start="344.46" dur="5.19">child support now he said in one of his</text>
  <text start="347.91" dur="3.27">court filings and I&amp;#39;ll summarize it</text>
  <text start="349.65" dur="4.29">basically I&amp;#39;m sure his attorney did it</text>
  <text start="351.18" dur="4.05">for him I don&amp;#39;t have any income I&amp;#39;m in</text>
  <text start="353.94" dur="3.51">debt and</text>
  <text start="355.23" dur="3.72">I want to seal my financial records so</text>
  <text start="357.45" dur="3.69">no one can see them because I think the</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="3.48">public is gonna tear through them well</text>
  <text start="361.14" dur="3.84">okay</text>
  <text start="362.43" dur="4.23">turns out that that those things could</text>
  <text start="364.98" dur="3.39">even be true and I&amp;#39;ve explained this</text>
  <text start="366.66" dur="3.57">before because if you aren&amp;#39;t currently</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="5.61">working and you aren&amp;#39;t currently getting</text>
  <text start="370.23" dur="5.07">a job you can say I don&amp;#39;t have a job and</text>
  <text start="373.98" dur="3.21">and that could be legal even if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="375.3" dur="3.44">making a billion dollars a month on your</text>
  <text start="377.19" dur="4.14">investments right you don&amp;#39;t have a job</text>
  <text start="378.74" dur="4.18">and the other thing is to say that</text>
  <text start="381.33" dur="3.45">you&amp;#39;re in debt look he could be making a</text>
  <text start="382.92" dur="4.71">billion dollars a month on a million</text>
  <text start="384.78" dur="4.32">dollars of debt probably not likely but</text>
  <text start="387.63" dur="4.08">this is corruption we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="389.1" dur="5.78">so these are not necessarily statements</text>
  <text start="391.71" dur="5.73">of truth that get to you - a true</text>
  <text start="394.88" dur="5.74">factual court case right these are these</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="5.13">are attempts to lie through some what</text>
  <text start="400.62" dur="3.78">fact these are attempts to use the truth</text>
  <text start="402.57" dur="4.11">to tell a lie I don&amp;#39;t know what you</text>
  <text start="404.4" dur="4.8">would call that dissembling or whatever</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="4.86">in a courtroom but not being completely</text>
  <text start="409.2" dur="4.35">honest anyway she presses the court and</text>
  <text start="411.54" dur="4.44">the judge agrees with her she gets to</text>
  <text start="413.55" dur="5.73">ask him under oath about his verismo</text>
  <text start="415.98" dur="4.74">Holdings income now this means I guess</text>
  <text start="419.28" dur="4.05">at least from my limited understanding</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="6.75">of the family court system in the human</text>
  <text start="423.33" dur="6.54">sand child support that this stripper is</text>
  <text start="427.47" dur="5.55">about to get a large chunk of this money</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="4.65">from from the Biden family that was of</text>
  <text start="433.02" dur="3.72">course given to them through corruption</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="4.11">if there&amp;#39;s anything left to take after</text>
  <text start="436.74" dur="4.77">of course all of those assets are seized</text>
  <text start="438.63" dur="5.91">so who knows right but she&amp;#39;s going for</text>
  <text start="441.51" dur="5.94">the jackpot and just in case it happens</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="4.86">you know we&amp;#39;ve seen big Biden into issue</text>
  <text start="447.45" dur="3.78">threats against others you know with his</text>
  <text start="449.4" dur="4.02">statement you&amp;#39;ll regret these for the</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="5.34">rest of your life kind of things to to</text>
  <text start="453.42" dur="6.06">focus like a Lindsey Graham who didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="456.57" dur="4.92">do much to regret by the way we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="459.48" dur="4.92">seen them issue threats so just in case</text>
  <text start="461.49" dur="4.5">she did not kill herself right I mean</text>
  <text start="464.4" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s the meme lately as all these</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="2.34">people didn&amp;#39;t kill themselves epstein</text>
  <text start="467.49" dur="2.64">didn&amp;#39;t kill himself</text>
  <text start="468.33" dur="3.06">Epstein&amp;#39;s attorney then who was found</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="2.07">hanging at the end of the rope didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="471.39" dur="3.48">kill himself</text>
  <text start="472.2" dur="4.83">I think Goldman Sachs and another firm I</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="3.51">just it&amp;#39;s getting wild so hopefully</text>
  <text start="477.03" dur="5.76">we&amp;#39;ll find some more evidence in these</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="6.589">preceding court hearings now we also</text>
  <text start="482.79" dur="4.009">have fake Magga fox</text>

  <text start="515.209" dur="4.38">course most people did not want it and</text>

  <text start="519.589" dur="4.08">say that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just another way</text>
  <text start="521" dur="4.709">of lying to people with the truth it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.669" dur="3.051">it&amp;#39;s the way of rigging statistics you</text>

  <text start="853.57" dur="5.4">it continues Hunter stayed in Los</text>
  <text start="856.66" dur="4.56">Angeles for about a week he said that he</text>
  <text start="858.97" dur="5.7">needed to get away and forget sooner</text>
  <text start="861.22" dur="4.7">after his arrival in LA he said he asked</text>
  <text start="864.67" dur="2.959">a homeless man and purse</text>
  <text start="865.92" dur="3.839">being square where he could buy crack</text>
  <text start="867.629" dur="3.99">Hunter said that the man took him to a</text>
  <text start="869.759" dur="4.411">nearby homeless encampment where a</text>
  <text start="871.619" dur="4.41">narrow passageway between tents someone</text>
  <text start="874.17" dur="4.259">put a gun to his head before realizing</text>
  <text start="876.029" dur="4.891">that he was the buyer he referred he</text>
  <text start="878.429" dur="5.43">returned to buy more crack a few times</text>
  <text start="880.92" dur="4.949">that week again not saying you know not</text>

  <text start="885.869" dur="3.361">someone goes through their personal life</text>
  <text start="887.22" dur="3.809">but it is just hard to believe that this</text>
  <text start="889.23" dur="3.659">was the guy wandering through homeless</text>
  <text start="891.029" dur="3.691">encampments by the crack there was worth</text>
  <text start="892.889" dur="3.72">eighty six thousand dollars a month to</text>
  <text start="894.72" dur="4.109">burry smih holding and that might be one</text>
  <text start="896.609" dur="3.931">of the reasons why what ABC asked hunter</text>
  <text start="898.829" dur="3.901">Biden hey you think you would have</text>
  <text start="900.54" dur="4.799">gotten this job in the absence of your</text>
  <text start="902.73" dur="5.49">dad being the vice president well he</text>
  <text start="905.339" dur="5.071">said probably not and then I looked to</text>
  <text start="908.22" dur="4.979">the record evidence and I looked at the</text>
  <text start="910.41" dur="4.44">testimony of mr. Kent mr. Kent was one</text>
  <text start="913.199" dur="3.36">of the witnesses they called on the</text>
  <text start="914.85" dur="4.259">first day he said Maurice Moe was so</text>
  <text start="916.559" dur="4.68">dirty that our own embassy had to pull</text>
  <text start="919.109" dur="4.44">out of a joint sponsorship with them</text>
  <text start="921.239" dur="4.47">when ambassador Jovanovic was being</text>
  <text start="923.549" dur="4.47">prepped for her Senate confirmation the</text>
  <text start="925.709" dur="4.38">Obama administration was so worried</text>
  <text start="928.019" dur="4.591">about the corruption around Maurice MA</text>
  <text start="930.089" dur="4.98">and hunter Biden that they held special</text>
  <text start="932.61" dur="4.919">prep moments to try to get ready for the</text>
  <text start="935.069" dur="4.26">inevitable questions about this obvious</text>
  <text start="937.529" dur="4.05">corruption that the president asked</text>
  <text start="939.329" dur="4.26">about mr. Kent again one of their</text>
  <text start="941.579" dur="4.831">witnesses from the first day also gave</text>
  <text start="943.589" dur="4.65">testimony that barrese ma had stood at</text>
  <text start="946.41" dur="5.13">the head of her Eastman had stolen 23</text>
  <text start="948.239" dur="5.611">million dollars in you the US and the UK</text>
  <text start="951.54" dur="4.829">and that he paid a bribe to get off the</text>
  <text start="953.85" dur="4.44">hook so again it&amp;#39;s not as if Maurice</text>
  <text start="956.369" dur="4.2">Maas pulling out new plays their</text>
  <text start="958.29" dur="4.379">playbook is to do dirty stuff and then</text>
  <text start="960.569" dur="5.45">go and pay bribes and hire the people</text>
  <text start="962.669" dur="5.88">necessary to make those problems go away</text>
  <text start="966.019" dur="4.03">this is why the minority hearing issue</text>
  <text start="968.549" dur="3.48">is so important by the way you you</text>
  <text start="970.049" dur="3.181">wonder why Republicans are so angry that</text>
  <text start="972.029" dur="3.15">we didn&amp;#39;t have a hearing to put on our</text>
  <text start="973.23" dur="3.509">own witnesses and own evidence and you</text>
  <text start="975.179" dur="3.63">may wonder why wolf they feel so good</text>
  <text start="976.739" dur="3.871">about their case why did they block our</text>
  <text start="978.809" dur="4.291">ability to put in evidence it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="980.61" dur="4.889">we have the ability to show that barrese</text>
  <text start="983.1" dur="4.56">&amp;#39;ma is corrupt we have the ability to</text>
  <text start="985.499" dur="4.74">show that hunter Biden is corrupt and</text>
  <text start="987.66" dur="4.799">that totally exculpate Stu quite the</text>
  <text start="990.239" dur="4.981">president because there is no way in the</text>
  <text start="992.459" dur="5.61">United States of America that honestly</text>
  <text start="995.22" dur="4.29">pursuing actual corruption is an</text>
  <text start="998.069" dur="2.791">impeachable offense</text>
  <text start="999.51" dur="3.8">that&amp;#39;s why they offer the amendment I</text>
