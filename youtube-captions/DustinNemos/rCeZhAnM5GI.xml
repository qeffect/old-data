  <text start="0.92" dur="5.589">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.48" dur="5.06">most of destiny most calm I am joined by</text>
  <text start="6.509" dur="3.811">dr. Christian Camela who is a</text>
  <text start="8.54" dur="4.21">world-renowned actually at this point</text>
  <text start="10.32" dur="5.279">stem-cell expert and she&amp;#39;s under attack</text>
  <text start="12.75" dur="4.949">by of course else Big Pharma and the</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="3.991">establishment for trying to help people</text>
  <text start="17.699" dur="3.451">what else right seems like you can do</text>
  <text start="19.59" dur="3.54">anything in this world except for good</text>
  <text start="21.15" dur="3.51">things and help people as soon as you</text>
  <text start="23.13" dur="3.83">start passing out Eliminator helping out</text>
  <text start="24.66" dur="5.25">the homeless you&amp;#39;re in trouble guys so</text>
  <text start="26.96" dur="5.89">Kristin thank you so much for joining us</text>
  <text start="29.91" dur="4.62">and you know I&amp;#39;m gonna let you kind of</text>
  <text start="32.85" dur="3.26">take the floor introduce yourself talk</text>
  <text start="34.53" dur="4.17">about your work which is very important</text>
  <text start="36.11" dur="4.84">which I you know I was I was exposed to</text>
  <text start="38.7" dur="4.199">over this weekend at autism one myself</text>
  <text start="40.95" dur="4.609">so again thank you for your time and</text>
  <text start="42.899" dur="4.98">kind of take it over thank you so much</text>
  <text start="45.559" dur="4.031">really appreciate the opportunity to</text>
  <text start="47.879" dur="3.121">speak to your audience and share a</text>
  <text start="49.59" dur="3.87">little bit about regenerative medicine</text>
  <text start="51" dur="5.37">stem cell therapy and what&amp;#39;s currently</text>
  <text start="53.46" dur="4.98">going on and how as Americans our rights</text>
  <text start="56.37" dur="4.11">are potentially going to be taken away</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="3.72">from us so this is a really important</text>
  <text start="60.48" dur="4.829">issue that I think everyone needs to</text>
  <text start="62.16" dur="5.61">know about the first idea is that every</text>
  <text start="65.309" dur="5.49">single one of us has amazing healing</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="4.95">potential inside our body and these are</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="4.471">our stem cells these are naturally</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="5.16">circulating at any given moment they are</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="4.68">repairing our tissues inside our body in</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="3.93">fact if you didn&amp;#39;t have stem cells you</text>
  <text start="79.95" dur="4.98">could only live for about an hour so</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="4.98">they play a very important role and the</text>
  <text start="84.93" dur="3.84">concept of regenerative medicine is that</text>
  <text start="86.79" dur="3.81">we can harness this healing potential</text>
  <text start="88.77" dur="4.919">that exists inside every single one of</text>
  <text start="90.6" dur="6.03">us and utilize it to overcome disease or</text>
  <text start="93.689" dur="5.79">injuries so at any given moment we may</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="5.699">have over inflammation or damaged tissue</text>
  <text start="99.479" dur="4.801">and the the good news is that we have a</text>
  <text start="102.329" dur="4.051">large amount of stem cells that are</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="5.43">lying in storage inside our fat tissue</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="6.239">so I like to refer to it as America&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.71" dur="4.5">natural resource we have more than</text>
  <text start="112.619" dur="3.841">enough stem cells here in America</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="4.409">because the fact is our our most</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="5.339">plentiful source of stem cells so in a</text>
  <text start="118.619" dur="6.6">very easy clinical procedure we can take</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="5.61">a small sample of fat tissue isolate the</text>
  <text start="125.219" dur="4.02">stem cells and then relocate those to</text>
  <text start="127.409" dur="3.871">where we might need them the most so as</text>
  <text start="129.239" dur="3.991">an example maybe you&amp;#39;re having trouble</text>
  <text start="131.28" dur="2.4">in your knee so we could inject the stem</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="2.94">cell</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="5.91">directly into your knee to help overcome</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="5.069">any damage now the great news about stem</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="5.459">cells is that they&amp;#39;re very smart they</text>
  <text start="141.239" dur="7.291">tend to home to or travel to areas of</text>
  <text start="145.049" dur="5.91">inflammation or damage so we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="4.14">necessarily have to know exactly what is</text>
  <text start="150.959" dur="4.321">wrong with you because your body is so</text>
  <text start="152.67" dur="4.86">smart it will seek out those areas of</text>
  <text start="155.28" dur="4.98">damage and go to the areas that need the</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="6.239">most help so we can apply stem cells to</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="6.27">so many different indications autoimmune</text>
  <text start="163.769" dur="4.89">diseases where we want to quiet down an</text>
  <text start="166.53" dur="5.359">over inflamed body we can apply it to</text>
  <text start="168.659" dur="6.39">neurological conditions Parkinson&amp;#39;s ALS</text>
  <text start="171.889" dur="5.74">MS spinal cord injuries we can apply it</text>
  <text start="175.049" dur="5.61">to orthopedics anything from Oster</text>
  <text start="177.629" dur="5.73">arthritis to an acute injury tendon</text>
  <text start="180.659" dur="4.5">repair you know things like ACL if you</text>
  <text start="183.359" dur="4.77">hurt yourself skin is there anything you</text>
  <text start="185.159" dur="4.47">can&amp;#39;t do well I mean I think that at</text>
  <text start="188.129" dur="3.631">this point there&amp;#39;s still a lot of</text>
  <text start="189.629" dur="4.08">research going on to determine the most</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="3.42">appropriate way to utilize the stem</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="4.051">cells the most appropriate delivery</text>
  <text start="195.18" dur="4.919">mechanisms but the concept is where you</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="5.52">have inflammation and or damaged tissue</text>
  <text start="200.099" dur="5.491">stem cells can be beneficial and so when</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="4.56">you think of it that way every disease</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="4.14">and injury that we are currently trying</text>
  <text start="207.84" dur="4.38">to manage has to do with inflammation</text>
  <text start="209.73" dur="5.49">and damaged tissue so keeping that in</text>
  <text start="212.22" dur="5.729">mind the sky&amp;#39;s the limit with regards to</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="4.829">utilizing stem cells now I focused my</text>
  <text start="217.949" dur="4.861">career on what are called autologous</text>
  <text start="220.049" dur="5.701">stem cells which are your own stem cells</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="6.179">and so the challenge is when the</text>
  <text start="225.75" dur="5.639">technology is inside you the cells are</text>
  <text start="228.989" dur="4.56">inside you there is nothing for</text>
  <text start="231.389" dur="4.53">pharmaceutical companies to bottle and</text>
  <text start="233.549" dur="3.9">sell and so of course this would be</text>
  <text start="235.919" dur="3.57">something that pharmaceutical companies</text>
  <text start="237.449" dur="4.231">would be against because there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="239.489" dur="4.801">profits in it for them so what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="241.68" dur="4.83">done at our clinics is a clinical</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="4.71">procedure we isolate the fat we collect</text>
  <text start="246.51" dur="6.53">the stem cells and we inject those so</text>
  <text start="249" dur="7.889">approximately a year ago I received a</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="6.64">draft lawsuit from the United States of</text>
  <text start="256.889" dur="5.46">America and the lawsuit read the United</text>
  <text start="259.68" dur="6.45">States of America versus Kristen Camela</text>
  <text start="262.349" dur="4.831">and our clinic as well and what it</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="4.23">stated is that this</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="5.88">stem cells inside your body are a drug</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="4.86">and as such we would not be permitted to</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="4.079">help patients utilize their own stem</text>
  <text start="275.22" dur="4.259">cells without the appropriate drug</text>
  <text start="277.139" dur="4.56">approvals in place and the reason that</text>
  <text start="279.479" dur="3.66">this doesn&amp;#39;t make sense is because no</text>
  <text start="281.699" dur="3.541">pharmaceutical company is going to pay</text>
  <text start="283.139" dur="4.261">the hundreds of millions of dollars to</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="4.41">get something approved that they aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="4.38">able to bottle and sell and because the</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="4.2">stem cells exist inside you they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="291.78" dur="4.65">able to bottle and sell it so it would</text>
  <text start="293.85" dur="4.86">essentially stop Americans from</text>
  <text start="296.43" dur="5.22">utilizing their own stem cells to heal</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="4.799">and so at that same time the United</text>
  <text start="301.65" dur="4.019">States of America offered me what was</text>
  <text start="303.509" dur="4.261">called a consent decree they said that</text>
  <text start="305.669" dur="5.671">if I agreed to sign the consent decree</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="5.91">go away be quiet and stop helping</text>
  <text start="311.34" dur="4.98">patients to use their own cells to heal</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="4.44">than they would not come after me if I</text>
  <text start="316.32" dur="4.68">did not sign this they would come after</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="4.799">me with a full lawsuit in the federal</text>
  <text start="321" dur="4.349">courts Department of Justice coming</text>
  <text start="322.919" dur="4.081">after me and they would come after me</text>
  <text start="325.349" dur="3.121">financially they would come after the</text>
  <text start="327" dur="5.099">business and they would seek what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="328.47" dur="6.449">called a permanent injunction as you can</text>
  <text start="332.099" dur="4.56">imagine that&amp;#39;s a big decision to make</text>
  <text start="334.919" dur="4.62">but there was never a doubt in my mind</text>
  <text start="336.659" dur="4.891">this technology is too important and</text>
  <text start="339.539" dur="5.16">Americans have a right to their own body</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="5.549">to heal and I felt that this is bigger</text>
  <text start="344.699" dur="4.981">than me and even though it would come at</text>
  <text start="347.099" dur="4.981">great sacrifice both financially as well</text>
  <text start="349.68" dur="5.489">as emotionally due to the attacks that</text>
  <text start="352.08" dur="5.67">then would you know be placed in the</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="4.5">media against me etc I chose not to</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="4.11">assign that consent decree and I chose</text>
  <text start="359.669" dur="3.451">to stand up for Americans because I</text>
  <text start="361.86" dur="3.48">think it&amp;#39;s important that Americans</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="3.81">understand they have this natural</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="3.81">healing ability inside their body and</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="6.829">and they have a right to use it and we</text>
  <text start="369.15" dur="7.35">have to push back you&amp;#39;ve trained</text>
  <text start="373.759" dur="5.321">hundreds of physicians in this technique</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="4.74">ranked we have so you know I wake up</text>
  <text start="379.08" dur="3.75">every single morning and I look in the</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="4.23">mirror and I say how am I going to help</text>
  <text start="382.83" dur="5.01">people heal today and one of the best</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="4.259">ways is to make sure that patients know</text>
  <text start="387.84" dur="4.199">and understand about their own stem</text>
  <text start="389.729" dur="4.41">cells so as such we began training</text>
  <text start="392.039" dur="3.6">programs for practitioners to learn</text>
  <text start="394.139" dur="4.201">about how to utilize these techniques</text>
  <text start="395.639" dur="4.941">inside their clinic we had trained more</text>
  <text start="398.34" dur="3.799">than 700 practitioners</text>
  <text start="400.58" dur="3.42">the point that the United States of</text>
  <text start="402.139" dur="3.96">America brought the lawsuit against me</text>
  <text start="404" dur="5.639">and by the way when they brought this</text>
  <text start="406.099" dur="6.211">suit against me they really started</text>
  <text start="409.639" dur="4.05">attacking they started subpoenaing every</text>
  <text start="412.31" dur="3.479">day I was getting served with a new</text>
  <text start="413.689" dur="5.07">subpoena they subpoenaed my college</text>
  <text start="415.789" dur="4.981">transcripts from over 20 years ago they</text>
  <text start="418.759" dur="6.301">subpoenaed all of our bank accounts my</text>
  <text start="420.77" dur="5.88">husband included they were serving us I</text>
  <text start="425.06" dur="4.169">was getting served almost every single</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="5.75">day the media came after us they started</text>
  <text start="429.229" dur="7.051">writing hit pieces about me they also</text>
  <text start="432.4" dur="5.859">went to my parents house and started</text>
  <text start="436.28" dur="4.05">interviewing my parents and attacking</text>
  <text start="438.259" dur="4.5">them um so you know it was just really</text>
  <text start="440.33" dur="6.299">kind of an unfair attack and so what I</text>
  <text start="442.759" dur="7.41">realized is our clinic which is a fairly</text>
  <text start="446.629" dur="6.211">small clinic we treat about you know 250</text>
  <text start="450.169" dur="5.28">to 500 patients a year</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="5.189">we must really be onto something that</text>
  <text start="455.449" dur="4.68">the full force of the United States of</text>
  <text start="458.029" dur="4.711">America was willing to come after us in</text>
  <text start="460.129" dur="5.461">such a way so I think that what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.74" dur="5.28">doing is really important yeah you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="465.59" dur="4.439">you&amp;#39;re definitely on something major in</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="3.769">terms of healing and that&amp;#39;s obviously</text>
  <text start="470.029" dur="4.471">very expensive especially when you start</text>
  <text start="471.789" dur="4.99">exponentially growing your your</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="3.87">techniques and your talents through</text>
  <text start="476.779" dur="4.621">teaching others that makes you a real</text>
  <text start="478.37" dur="4.68">threat I hope you don&amp;#39;t disappear of</text>
  <text start="481.4" dur="4.229">course being in the public light helps</text>
  <text start="483.05" dur="4.919">that a lot so everyone keep an eye on</text>
  <text start="485.629" dur="4.051">her and and please support her obviously</text>
  <text start="487.969" dur="3.721">this is a big fight for all of us this</text>
  <text start="489.68" dur="3.959">is just like when they try to patent</text>
  <text start="491.69" dur="4.349">your DNA everything else like this is</text>
  <text start="493.639" dur="5.971">our bodies it&amp;#39;s you know about of your</text>
  <text start="496.039" dur="6.84">choice supposedly just not in any other</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="4.709">issue that matters right so Kristen</text>
  <text start="502.879" dur="3.301">what&amp;#39;s coming next I mean you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="504.319" dur="3.75">spending like half a million dollars a</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="3.51">month or something I&amp;#39;m hearing on legal</text>
  <text start="508.069" dur="4.53">expenses you know you probably don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="509.69" dur="5.729">have that no I don&amp;#39;t I have definitely</text>
  <text start="512.599" dur="5.971">brought myself into a world of debt as a</text>
  <text start="515.419" dur="5.071">result of this fight but you know jokes</text>
  <text start="518.57" dur="4.29">on them I don&amp;#39;t define myself by money</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="5.37">and again I think this is just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="522.86" dur="4.919">too important it&amp;#39;s bigger than me and I</text>
  <text start="525.86" dur="4.89">think that it will have a way of working</text>
  <text start="527.779" dur="6.211">out in the end the truth will prevail</text>
  <text start="530.75" dur="3.69">and you know sometimes I do get gripped</text>
  <text start="533.99" dur="3.63">by the</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="4.68">year I certainly get nervous you know</text>
  <text start="537.62" dur="2.73">sometimes looking over my shoulder but I</text>
  <text start="539.12" dur="4.64">just don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s appropriate to</text>
  <text start="540.35" dur="5.88">live that way you know I have to just</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="3.85">keep fighting the fight and know that</text>
  <text start="546.23" dur="5.43">there are millions of people who are</text>
  <text start="547.61" dur="6.06">behind me and as the people who come</text>
  <text start="551.66" dur="4.44">together and speak we can be more</text>
  <text start="553.67" dur="3.69">powerful than the small group of people</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="3.42">that are trying to prevent this</text>
  <text start="557.36" dur="3.87">technology from going forward so we just</text>
  <text start="559.52" dur="4.14">have to have a bigger voice and I think</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="4.35">when they first brought the fight to me</text>
  <text start="563.66" dur="3.27">and they brought that draft lawsuit that</text>
  <text start="565.58" dur="4.7">they thought that I would just go away</text>
  <text start="566.93" dur="6">and be quiet and it&amp;#39;s just not in my DNA</text>
  <text start="570.28" dur="5.14">I&amp;#39;m gonna stand up for what I believe is</text>
  <text start="572.93" dur="6.99">right and and in the end that truth will</text>
  <text start="575.42" dur="8.1">prevail so we have upcoming a date for</text>
  <text start="579.92" dur="6.36">the trial we are it&amp;#39;s a civil case in</text>
  <text start="583.52" dur="5.13">the federal courts the trial will be</text>
  <text start="586.28" dur="4.92">here in South Florida as part of the</text>
  <text start="588.65" dur="6">federal courts before a judge the court</text>
  <text start="591.2" dur="6.42">dates are set for the end of June any</text>
  <text start="594.65" dur="4.62">point up to that date the judge could</text>
  <text start="597.62" dur="3.81">rule on what&amp;#39;s called a summary</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="4.41">judgement so she could make a ruling</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="5.64">without requiring us to go through the</text>
  <text start="603.68" dur="5.73">full-blown trial but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s uncertain</text>
  <text start="607.07" dur="4.17">so you know at any moment I could get</text>
  <text start="609.41" dur="5.34">noticed that she&amp;#39;s ruled one way or the</text>
  <text start="611.24" dur="6.03">other the challenge is that if I am</text>
  <text start="614.75" dur="4.05">successful and I believe that we will be</text>
  <text start="617.27" dur="2.76">successful I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know exactly</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="3.84">what that&amp;#39;s going to look like but I</text>
  <text start="620.03" dur="4.53">think the truth will prevail and I if we</text>
  <text start="622.64" dur="4.08">are successful in this first round the</text>
  <text start="624.56" dur="4.62">government can certainly appeal and</text>
  <text start="626.72" dur="4.23">continue to fight so I think what what</text>
  <text start="629.18" dur="2.97">is unfortunate when you&amp;#39;re fighting the</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="3.93">government is that they have unlimited</text>
  <text start="632.15" dur="5.73">resources so really all they have to do</text>
  <text start="634.88" dur="5.76">is out spend you and I&amp;#39;m getting to the</text>
  <text start="637.88" dur="4.77">end of that runway so I&amp;#39;m to the point</text>
  <text start="640.64" dur="6.27">where there&amp;#39;s not going to be a lot more</text>
  <text start="642.65" dur="5.64">fight left financially so you know does</text>
  <text start="646.91" dur="3.24">that mean I just have to change my fight</text>
  <text start="648.29" dur="3.84">I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="650.15" dur="5.34">look like but I will continue to fight</text>
  <text start="652.13" dur="6.72">for as long as I live well we love you</text>
  <text start="655.49" dur="5.16">for it thank you so much and anything</text>
  <text start="658.85" dur="3.39">that we can do to help I know at least a</text>
  <text start="660.65" dur="4.56">few other influencers that would love to</text>
  <text start="662.24" dur="4.2">chat with you about this so we can at</text>
  <text start="665.21" dur="2.64">least start getting the word out there</text>

  <text start="674.21" dur="4.86">establishment and grabbing a line by the</text>
  <text start="676.43" dur="4.2">tail and I love it I&amp;#39;m kind of trying to</text>
  <text start="679.07" dur="4.26">do the same thing with the lawsuit and</text>
  <text start="680.63" dur="5.55">stuff so let&amp;#39;s take it to them there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="683.33" dur="5.91">too many of us to stop now I think so I</text>
  <text start="686.18" dur="5.49">think so and and really if you know if</text>
  <text start="689.24" dur="4.77">we don&amp;#39;t fight on things like this we</text>
  <text start="691.67" dur="3.84">all lose you know and and the people</text>
  <text start="694.01" dur="3.69">that get affected are the patients who</text>
  <text start="695.51" dur="4.8">so desperately need our help they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="697.7" dur="4.41">have the luxury of time and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="700.31" dur="3.51">necessarily have the voice right now so</text>

  <text start="813.959" dur="4.62">in particular first responders veterans</text>

  <text start="838.319" dur="5.851">they can make a donation there wow that</text>
  <text start="841.74" dur="4.11">is amazing I you know I was when it when</text>
  <text start="844.17" dur="3.539">I was at also someone my first thought</text>
  <text start="845.85" dur="3.109">hearing about this was how we drive her</text>
  <text start="847.709" dur="3.75">more business and we get more attention</text>
  <text start="848.959" dur="4.93">my first thought was to do sort of like</text>
  <text start="851.459" dur="4.891">a raffle or giveaway or somehow of your</text>
  <text start="853.889" dur="4.86">maybe like pay for someone to get healed</text>
  <text start="856.35" dur="4.56">and through the stem-cell treatment in</text>
  <text start="858.749" dur="3.9">their own body and then maybe we do that</text>
  <text start="860.91" dur="2.869">once a month across all media we could</text>
  <text start="862.649" dur="4.05">generate a lot of interest in</text>
  <text start="863.779" dur="5.23">alternative health causes because you</text>
  <text start="866.699" dur="3.81">know right now let&amp;#39;s face it you said</text>
  <text start="869.009" dur="2.851">you kind of joked a little bit in my</text>
  <text start="870.509" dur="3.241">head earlier you said something about</text>
  <text start="871.86" dur="3.3">fat in America and I was like no you</text>
  <text start="873.75" dur="4.769">know kind of a fat nation we probably</text>
  <text start="875.16" dur="6.75">have plenty of stem cells around yeah</text>
  <text start="878.519" dur="5.76">but at the same point I mean we really</text>
  <text start="881.91" dur="4.289">are a nation that could use this we</text>
  <text start="884.279" dur="4.17">really are a nation that is besieged in</text>
  <text start="886.199" dur="4.62">all levels of health and ability to use</text>
  <text start="888.449" dur="4.051">our own stem cells to do some massive</text>
  <text start="890.819" dur="3.091">and dramatic things I think you would</text>
  <text start="892.5" dur="3.089">excite people I think they would show up</text>
  <text start="893.91" dur="3.33">to the show to our show is just for that</text>
  <text start="895.589" dur="3.6">I agree yeah</text>

  <text start="899.189" dur="4.71">program um I think it&amp;#39;s a great idea</text>
