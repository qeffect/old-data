  <text start="97.05" dur="4.08">of context here that there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="99.24" dur="3.84">this going on there&amp;#39;s a lot of stories I</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="4.08">didn&amp;#39;t even mention the London Bridge</text>

  <text start="105.21" dur="4.65">he was a knife attacker and it was a</text>

  <text start="133.52" dur="5.71">jacket I don&amp;#39;t even know what that is a</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="6.42">fake suicide bomber hoax vest I guess</text>
  <text start="139.23" dur="5.07">which is very unusual now we also have</text>
  <text start="142.2" dur="4.41">one example and this is in France French</text>
  <text start="144.3" dur="4.65">prosecutors dropped the charges against</text>
  <text start="146.61" dur="4.56">a Muslim home while screaming Allahu</text>
  <text start="148.95" dur="4.23">Akbar which you know god is great in</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="3.72">their language who beat an elderly</text>
  <text start="153.18" dur="4.8">Jewish woman and tossed her from the</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="5.28">third-floor balcony he was let go and</text>
  <text start="157.98" dur="6.15">they dropped the charges because he was</text>
  <text start="160.17" dur="6.03">high on pot look guys that I&amp;#39;m not like</text>
  <text start="164.13" dur="3.72">against medical marijuana I&amp;#39;m not even</text>
  <text start="166.2" dur="3.42">against legalizing marijuana for</text>
  <text start="167.85" dur="3.93">recreational use I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="169.62" dur="3.93">best thing out there for you but look</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s not hurting anyone you&amp;#39;re not doing</text>
  <text start="173.55" dur="3.78">any damage to others it&amp;#39;s not gonna call</text>
  <text start="175.77" dur="3.9">you to have cancer may actually help</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="4.17">prevent the cancer it&amp;#39;s just not the</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="3.75">best thing for you personally because</text>
  <text start="181.5" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s still kind of a vice it can still</text>
  <text start="183.42" dur="4.17">be abused it can still become addictive</text>
  <text start="185.37" dur="4.11">to certain personality types on the</text>
  <text start="187.59" dur="3.54">other flip side of that I&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="189.48" dur="3.21">help my brother get off of heroin I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="191.13" dur="3.63">seen it help family members and other</text>
  <text start="192.69" dur="4.019">people deal with things like that and</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="3.75">get off of these things without having</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="3.901">to go to the methadone clinic which is</text>
  <text start="198.51" dur="4.89">basically more heroin things like that</text>
  <text start="200.61" dur="6">so it&amp;#39;s one of those things where it has</text>
  <text start="203.4" dur="4.95">its own good bad profile but the fact</text>
  <text start="206.61" dur="3.78">that they would allow someone to use it</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="4.8">as a scapegoat to get out of a crime</text>
  <text start="210.39" dur="4.14">where they assume it I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="213.15" dur="4.14">happened to though I&amp;#39;m assuming that she</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="5.97">was killed in the third floor fall</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="6.77">that&amp;#39;s an elderly woman so look this is</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="6.65">insane and it has nothing to do with pot</text>
  <text start="224.06" dur="4.92">obviously his his violence has nothing</text>
  <text start="227.15" dur="4.44">do with pot he may be the only person</text>
  <text start="228.98" dur="5.009">who&amp;#39;s ever smoked pot and then committed</text>
  <text start="231.59" dur="4.649">a violent because generally you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.989" dur="3.72">see that and if you do see that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.239" dur="4.351">because they were mixing in other drugs</text>
  <text start="237.709" dur="3.301">like alcohol like hard drugs things like</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="2.099">that</text>
  <text start="241.01" dur="3.839">so I don&amp;#39;t want people to get a bad</text>
  <text start="242.689" dur="3.931">impression of pot I do want you to get a</text>
  <text start="244.849" dur="4.5">bad impression of Muslim terrorists</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="5.039">extremists who scream Allah Akbar and</text>
  <text start="249.349" dur="5.39">commit acts of violence in countries</text>
  <text start="251.659" dur="5.55">where they&amp;#39;re a guest now talking about</text>
  <text start="254.739" dur="4.771">you know religions and and different</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="5.551">things like that we&amp;#39;ve often considered</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="5.29">chick-fil-a to be a bastion of you know</text>
  <text start="262.76" dur="4.71">sort of conservative values and standing</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="4.56">up for for time off on Sundays for rest</text>
  <text start="267.47" dur="4.11">you know kind of in line with the Bible</text>
  <text start="269.36" dur="4.35">and and the Sabbath which actually is</text>
  <text start="271.58" dur="4.14">Saturday for those who don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="273.71" dur="3.57">always confused me the Sabbath being on</text>
  <text start="275.72" dur="5.46">Saturday and people celebrating on</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="6.18">Sunday but the the chick-fil-a that we</text>
  <text start="281.18" dur="4.169">have come to know in recent days is a</text>
  <text start="283.46" dur="4.709">little bit different they have been</text>
  <text start="285.349" dur="5.311">busted now actually donating money to</text>
  <text start="288.169" dur="5.131">groups like the SPLC and other leftist</text>
  <text start="290.66" dur="5.189">groups now the SPLC the Southern Poverty</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="5.64">Law Center are one of the premier groups</text>
  <text start="295.849" dur="4.831">waging war on people like myself ho tell</text>
  <text start="298.94" dur="3.36">the truth on the internet because they</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="4.14">go around and they spread and create</text>
  <text start="302.3" dur="5.19">propaganda calling us violent in order</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="5.159">to give or hateful or racist or whatever</text>
  <text start="307.49" dur="5.01">it may be in order to give the pretext a</text>
  <text start="309.979" dur="4.44">big tech to just ban us so the Southern</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="5.01">Poverty Law Center which doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="314.419" dur="5.071">help any southern poor people is really</text>
  <text start="317.51" dur="4.08">more of a propaganda outfit to attack</text>
  <text start="319.49" dur="4.26">right-wing leaders and conservative</text>
  <text start="321.59" dur="5.069">leaders and they&amp;#39;re very good at it and</text>
  <text start="323.75" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;ve done a lot of damage already and</text>
  <text start="326.659" dur="4.081">the fact that chick-fil-a would would</text>
  <text start="328.94" dur="4.44">consider that it would be okay to donate</text>
  <text start="330.74" dur="5.1">money to them and fund the destruction</text>
  <text start="333.38" dur="3.99">of our republic of our way of life of</text>
  <text start="335.84" dur="3.299">our free speech and of our religious</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="5.13">values because the Southern Poverty Law</text>
  <text start="339.139" dur="5.881">Center is no friend of Christianity this</text>
  <text start="342.5" dur="4.62">is very disturbing I for one will no</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="5.579">longer be eating msg Laden chick-fil-a</text>
  <text start="347.12" dur="7.859">burgers because msg is bad for you and</text>
  <text start="350.599" dur="6.12">so is chick-fil-a so anyway talk back to</text>
  <text start="354.979" dur="4.081">pot I guess pots on the agenda today</text>
  <text start="356.719" dur="4.411">Illinois and I signed up sometimes I say</text>
  <text start="359.06" dur="4.26">Illinois&amp;#39;s like an idiot but Illinois</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="5.73">just kids about habit city approves</text>
  <text start="363.32" dur="6.99">using marijuana taxes to fun reparations</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="6.96">program so you have Chicago in one</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="7.2">suburb now apparently using recreational</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="6.09">marijuana sales which is the tax money</text>
  <text start="377.51" dur="4.28">from pot for fun right to just people</text>
  <text start="379.91" dur="3.54">smoking pot now in Illinois</text>
  <text start="381.79" dur="4.72">congratulations it&amp;#39;s good for you guys</text>
  <text start="383.45" dur="4.82">that&amp;#39;s a rare move of freedom in in</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="4.52">Illinois because it&amp;#39;s a pretty</text>
  <text start="388.27" dur="6.19">tyrannical state in terms of most laws</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="4.81">now what&amp;#39;s goin what&amp;#39;s interesting here</text>
  <text start="394.46" dur="3.84">is that they&amp;#39;re actually giving a</text>
  <text start="395.84" dur="4.89">specific race a handout so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="398.3" dur="4.41">black you get some of this money or it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="400.73" dur="5.19">gonna go toward black only kind of thing</text>
  <text start="402.71" dur="5.13">so you know blacks only allowed except</text>
  <text start="405.92" dur="3.78">of course remember you&amp;#39;re in Chicago so</text>
  <text start="407.84" dur="3.44">if you&amp;#39;re a different race and you want</text>
  <text start="409.7" dur="4.59">to get some of that free black money</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="5.02">identify as black and then sue them when</text>
  <text start="414.29" dur="3.63">they say no because that will work in</text>
  <text start="416.3" dur="3.06">leftie cities and you&amp;#39;ll probably get</text>
  <text start="417.92" dur="4.28">like hundreds of thousands of dollars</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="5.46">for for being a oppressed trans person</text>
  <text start="422.2" dur="4.24">because this nonsense doesn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="424.82" dur="4.2">and when you start trying to pass out</text>
  <text start="426.44" dur="5.64">favors based on skin color everyone</text>
  <text start="429.02" dur="4.83">starts fighting for the the jackpot</text>
  <text start="432.08" dur="3.45">right that&amp;#39;s exactly why we had</text>
  <text start="433.85" dur="3.78">separation of religion in the first</text>
  <text start="435.53" dur="4.11">place why does religion have anything to</text>
  <text start="437.63" dur="4.23">do with race what&amp;#39;s the same thing if</text>
  <text start="439.64" dur="4.98">your religious group is competing with</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="5.43">other religious groups say Jewish Muslim</text>
  <text start="444.62" dur="4.92">Catholic Christian whatever and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="447.29" dur="4.35">trying to get the power of the state to</text>
  <text start="449.54" dur="3.42">force your views on other people who</text>
  <text start="451.64" dur="2.94">maybe don&amp;#39;t agree with you maybe their</text>
  <text start="452.96" dur="3.93">views are offensive maybe you want to</text>
  <text start="454.58" dur="4.74">take over the voting process and force</text>
  <text start="456.89" dur="4.59">everyone to worship Sharia law because</text>
  <text start="459.32" dur="3.86">you find that they Pig or whatever work</text>
  <text start="461.48" dur="4.74">or whatever is to be very offensive and</text>
  <text start="463.18" dur="5.08">maybe that&amp;#39;s your goal is to to help</text>
  <text start="466.22" dur="4.29">your religion by using violence of the</text>
  <text start="468.26" dur="4.8">state to force it on other religions</text>
  <text start="470.51" dur="4.97">that is why we have separation of church</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="4.74">and state we do not unfortunately</text>
  <text start="475.48" dur="4.06">because of a communist attempt to take</text>
  <text start="477.8" dur="4.32">over and separate and divide and conquer</text>
  <text start="479.54" dur="6">everything we do not have separation of</text>
  <text start="482.12" dur="5.34">government and race we have separation</text>
  <text start="485.54" dur="3.9">of government and church we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="4.04">separation of state and a race which</text>
  <text start="489.44" dur="4.35">would be very useful to have because</text>
  <text start="491.5" dur="3.49">obviously when you start passing out</text>
  <text start="493.79" dur="3.33">race-based</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="3.87">perks you&amp;#39;re going to get right back</text>
  <text start="497.12" dur="3.6">into that situation where all of the</text>
  <text start="498.86" dur="3.959">different groups are going to be</text>
  <text start="500.72" dur="3.509">competing for that big handout</text>
  <text start="502.819" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s stolen from the other groups</text>
  <text start="504.229" dur="3.84">because that&amp;#39;s exactly what this is if</text>
  <text start="506.419" dur="2.191">it&amp;#39;s money that&amp;#39;s not being distributed</text>
  <text start="508.069" dur="3.871">equally</text>
  <text start="508.61" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s basically theft from one race to</text>
  <text start="511.94" dur="5.49">another it&amp;#39;s a wealth redistribution</text>
  <text start="514.01" dur="4.709">program and we know how those end up if</text>
  <text start="517.43" dur="2.489">you think that&amp;#39;s a good thing if you</text>
  <text start="518.719" dur="3.151">think that you&amp;#39;re gonna be on the</text>
  <text start="519.919" dur="4.29">receiving end of that as a black person</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="4.5">well hang on because if metrics are</text>
  <text start="524.209" dur="4.771">correct by 2050 blacks will be a</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="5.159">minority here as well Latinos will have</text>
  <text start="528.98" dur="4.049">sort of taken over so if you think</text>
  <text start="531.529" dur="3.481">that&amp;#39;s the case what happens when</text>
  <text start="533.029" dur="4.381">Latinos want reparations from blacks</text>
  <text start="535.01" dur="4.26">well by then it will be precedent it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="4.32">be law and you&amp;#39;ll be forced to pay it so</text>
  <text start="539.27" dur="5.069">this is not a good thing for any free</text>
  <text start="541.73" dur="4.799">person at all even those who supposedly</text>
  <text start="544.339" dur="3.361">benefit because of course the</text>
  <text start="546.529" dur="2.761">government&amp;#39;s gonna keep all the money</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="3.6">and not give you anything but handouts</text>
  <text start="549.29" dur="5.04">anyway and link the scraps that&amp;#39;s left</text>
  <text start="551.3" dur="5.55">over at the table now continuing on</text>
  <text start="554.33" dur="5.1">talking about government and corruption</text>
  <text start="556.85" dur="5.4">and what tends to happen there we have</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="5.33">anti-vaccine author Jennifer Jane&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="562.25" dur="5.82">hope I said that right err Janus Jane&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="564.76" dur="6.85">has been found dead two shots to the</text>
  <text start="568.07" dur="4.86">head ruled a suicide right how do you</text>
  <text start="571.61" dur="4.44">get two shots to the head ruled a</text>
  <text start="572.93" dur="5.159">suicide and of course they even put a</text>
  <text start="576.05" dur="3.599">Lurie quote in here and I I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="578.089" dur="4.141">Hillary is out there personally like</text>
  <text start="579.649" dur="4.38">Arkin siding the anti backs folks I</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="3.12">think that would be Big Pharma she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.029" dur="3.781">probably got her hands full with Trump</text>
  <text start="585.35" dur="4.38">but it is interesting that she said one</text>
  <text start="587.81" dur="2.61">thing I&amp;#39;m grateful for are vaccines that</text>
  <text start="589.73" dur="3.27">save lives</text>
  <text start="590.42" dur="4.08">there aren&amp;#39;t any let&amp;#39;s all do our part</text>
  <text start="593" dur="3.27">to counter anti vaccination</text>

  <text start="1044.47" dur="6.36">that we still have it in other forms but</text>
  <text start="1047.589" dur="5.55">what happened was that the the white</text>

  <text start="1053.139" dur="5.37">would die variously of different</text>
  <text start="1055.149" dur="5.88">diseases very fast most of them so it</text>
  <text start="1058.509" dur="6.211">was really hard to penetrate those those</text>

  <text start="1093.1" dur="4.559">were wiped out okay that&amp;#39;s a virgin soil</text>

  <text start="1097.659" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;ve got the rise of superbugs that are</text>
