  <text start="166.66" dur="6.6">President Trump here so look YouTube is</text>
  <text start="169.69" dur="6.12">even censoring Trump himself don&amp;#39;t think</text>

  <text start="189.91" dur="4.26">video are watched every day on YouTube I</text>
  <text start="191.68" dur="5.07">think it is we&amp;#39;re not going to be</text>
  <text start="194.17" dur="4.289">financially viable for them playing</text>
  <text start="196.75" dur="4.709">hundreds of thousands of subscribers</text>
  <text start="198.459" dur="4.861">videos unless we&amp;#39;re paying YouTube with</text>
  <text start="201.459" dur="3.75">ad money we&amp;#39;re not going to do that</text>
  <text start="203.32" dur="3.62">because they&amp;#39;ve taken their I have money</text>
  <text start="205.209" dur="3.84">away from us and they will not let</text>
  <text start="206.94" dur="4.18">legitimate businesses in legitimate</text>
  <text start="209.049" dur="4.44">independent media interact and have</text>
  <text start="211.12" dur="4.26">funding even though it costs YouTube</text>
  <text start="213.489" dur="4.08">money they&amp;#39;ve shown that they&amp;#39;re willing</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="4.47">to lose money to hurt us in to silence</text>
  <text start="217.569" dur="4.711">us and to censor us what is their</text>
  <text start="219.85" dur="3.87">economic loss and confuses a lot of</text>
  <text start="222.28" dur="3.75">people because yes they&amp;#39;re a business</text>
  <text start="223.72" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re about making money is also their</text>
  <text start="226.03" dur="4.29">political gain and as we know the best</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="3.12">investment that a business can make is</text>
  <text start="230.32" dur="3.48">in politicians that&amp;#39;s where you get the</text>
  <text start="231.79" dur="3.99">billion times</text>
  <text start="233.8" dur="3.9">turn on your investment that&amp;#39;s where you</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="3.69">can get big government contracts because</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="4.5">you bought the right person you back to</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="4.68">the right horse I guess it is and these</text>
  <text start="242.2" dur="4.35">politicians should probably just be like</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="4.32">NASCAR people where they wear a jacket</text>
  <text start="246.55" dur="3.93">that has all the decals or the stickers</text>
  <text start="248.47" dur="4.85">on them including a big sticker on their</text>
  <text start="250.48" dur="7.319">forehead that says George Soros so</text>
  <text start="253.32" dur="6.07">anyway corny corny but every time I make</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="3.66">myself laugh I&amp;#39;m gonna play this because</text>
  <text start="259.39" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m learning how to use these Eladio</text>
  <text start="261.459" dur="3.991">buttons on the keyboard over here for my</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="5.52">audio board I&amp;#39;m having all these</text>
  <text start="265.45" dur="6.84">terribly snap crackle pop noises and my</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="4.95">my feedback and stuff but as I was</text>
  <text start="272.29" dur="5.76">trying to fix that I&amp;#39;m starting to learn</text>
  <text start="274" dur="6">some new tricks and there&amp;#39;s that static</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="4.08">you hear it tick tick ticking like</text>
  <text start="280" dur="5.25">sometimes it&amp;#39;s worse so we have a</text>
  <text start="282.13" dur="5.67">president Trump even being censored and</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="5.1">then you guys have seen the the clip</text>
  <text start="287.8" dur="4.35">recently where Joe Biden was just really</text>

  <text start="294.19" dur="4.8">look I understand he&amp;#39;s losing his</text>
  <text start="296.35" dur="4.86">faculties here but isn&amp;#39;t it telling that</text>
  <text start="298.99" dur="3.99">even his jokes still involve creepiness</text>
  <text start="301.21" dur="3.36">with children being on his lap and</text>
  <text start="302.98" dur="4.68">touching his hairy legs and stuff like</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="5.73">that anyway it was creepy but now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.66" dur="4.89">also funny because someone made a really</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="3.869">good Joe Biden cartoon and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>

  <text start="335.379" dur="4.771">hair come back up again they look at it</text>
  <text start="338.53" dur="4.289">so I learned about roaches I learned</text>
  <text start="340.15" dur="6.079">about kids jumping on my lap and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="342.819" dur="3.41">loved kids jumping on my life</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="4.15">and it was really that weird and I love</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="3.39">how they gave him that little bloody eye</text>

  <text start="367.319" dur="3.03">thought about putting this behind me so</text>
  <text start="368.939" dur="4.111">you guys could see things on the screen</text>
  <text start="370.349" dur="4.891">as I as I go and I&amp;#39;ve still got a lot of</text>
  <text start="373.05" dur="5.07">work to do on my background on my studio</text>
  <text start="375.24" dur="5.399">and all that stuff but um I stare here</text>
  <text start="378.12" dur="4.74">at this screen like 16 17 hours a day</text>
  <text start="380.639" dur="3.81">either this laptop work or this big</text>
  <text start="382.86" dur="3.839">screen which I kind of roll away from a</text>

  <text start="386.699" dur="3.93">bloodshot eyes but I&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="4.859">anyone get bloodshot eyes like he did</text>
  <text start="390.629" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s like something ruptured and some</text>
  <text start="393.419" dur="5.191">people have taken that to mean like it</text>
  <text start="394.919" dur="5.97">almost like a like a spiritual message</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="4.38">or something that he really is just evil</text>
  <text start="400.889" dur="4.5">of course now I I don&amp;#39;t want to go that</text>
  <text start="402.99" dur="4.049">far could just be a health issue but</text>
  <text start="405.389" dur="3.3">certainly a lot of things like that</text>
  <text start="407.039" dur="3.93">happen around some of these folks that</text>
  <text start="408.689" dur="4.95">are really bad you know Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="410.969" dur="5.401">falling apart basically people think she</text>
  <text start="413.639" dur="3.84">has kuru right a disease of cannibalism</text>
  <text start="416.37" dur="3.509">because of course some of the</text>
  <text start="417.479" dur="5.16">allegations against her and the pizza</text>
  <text start="419.879" dur="5.1">Gaytan and Laura sills be in Haiti and</text>
  <text start="422.639" dur="3.75">and many other issues going around with</text>
  <text start="424.979" dur="3.541">a Clinton Foundation but we&amp;#39;ll deal with</text>
  <text start="426.389" dur="5.131">that in another video and we have in the</text>
  <text start="428.52" dur="5.34">past so we also have Lisa page here</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="6.239">possibly turning rat against McCabe</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="4.919">stroke and FBI colleagues now this takes</text>
  <text start="437.759" dur="2.94">a little bit of reading between the</text>
  <text start="438.779" dur="3.45">lines it takes a little bit of context</text>
  <text start="440.699" dur="3.361">and also I want to mention for those</text>
  <text start="442.229" dur="5.34">who&amp;#39;ve been around the Q movement we</text>
  <text start="444.06" dur="5.55">knew this like a year ago okay but I do</text>
  <text start="447.569" dur="3.69">have a lot of respect for Thomas Paine</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="3.54">over at Troop London who&amp;#39;s been through</text>
  <text start="451.259" dur="3.81">quite a bit and has a lot of hands-on</text>
  <text start="453.15" dur="5.129">experience dealing with these shady</text>
  <text start="455.069" dur="6.09">types including the FBI know he was</text>
  <text start="458.279" dur="5.581">received a threatening letter from Lisa</text>
  <text start="461.159" dur="5.37">Paige&amp;#39;s attorney in this threatening</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="4.89">letter she admitted something and he</text>
  <text start="466.529" dur="3.69">being a very you know astute expert</text>
  <text start="468.75" dur="3.81">who&amp;#39;s dealt with a lot of this kind of</text>
  <text start="470.219" dur="4.62">crap in the past was able to discern</text>
  <text start="472.56" dur="5.039">some things from it logical deduction</text>
  <text start="474.839" dur="4.511">here and it&amp;#39;s not absolute proof but he</text>
  <text start="477.599" dur="4.091">said that in the attorney her</text>
  <text start="479.35" dur="5.7">in the letter her attorney Jeffress said</text>
  <text start="481.69" dur="6.45">this quote she Lisa page is not a target</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="5.99">of the German vestigation so he he</text>
  <text start="488.14" dur="5.73">deducted logically speaking you know</text>
  <text start="491.04" dur="6.13">coming around to the Sherlock Holmes</text>
  <text start="493.87" dur="8.49">style here deduction idea Watson so we</text>
  <text start="497.17" dur="6.84">have a corny corny bug of sir goofy I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="3.51">having fun because otherwise I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="504.01" dur="3.84">gonna get angry at the stupid soundboard</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="4.5">so for me you know I don&amp;#39;t like being</text>
  <text start="507.85" dur="3.84">angry I&amp;#39;m a Zen guy I&amp;#39;m happy everything</text>
  <text start="510.37" dur="3.39">is going well in life except for</text>
  <text start="511.69" dur="3.9">censorship we have Trump I mean I&amp;#39;m so</text>
  <text start="513.76" dur="3.51">positive and optimistic about life I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="515.59" dur="4.53">just gonna have fun instead of getting</text>
  <text start="517.27" dur="4.29">worried about things and I encourage</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="2.79">people to do that it makes things a</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="5.67">little bit easier in life because we all</text>
  <text start="522.91" dur="5.97">suffer anyway so he says one of the</text>
  <text start="527.23" dur="2.3">three possibilities that this means to</text>
  <text start="528.88" dur="3.54">him</text>
  <text start="529.53" dur="4.57">Jeffress is posturing and he says early</text>
  <text start="532.42" dur="3.36">an article that he doubts this because</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="3.9">he spoken to other FBI agents even</text>
  <text start="535.78" dur="5.4">former clients of hers in the FBI who</text>
  <text start="538" dur="4.98">say she&amp;#39;s not one to posture - that</text>
  <text start="541.18" dur="3.66">means that lisa page has struck a deal</text>
  <text start="542.98" dur="4.68">with the DOJ to rat out her FBI</text>
  <text start="544.84" dur="5.34">colleagues cohorts in exchange she is</text>
  <text start="547.66" dur="6.66">immunity or the DOJ assurances she won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="550.18" dur="5.85">be a target indicted okay so I we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="554.32" dur="3.81">talked about that quite a bit in the</text>
  <text start="556.03" dur="4.8">queue movement and we know who&amp;#39;s stepped</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="5.16">down has been cooperating witness who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="560.83" dur="4.02">been removed from power a number of</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="3.99">people in the FBI have been removed from</text>
  <text start="564.85" dur="3.96">power or fired or stepped down and the</text>
  <text start="567.28" dur="3.36">number have also become flop rating</text>
  <text start="568.81" dur="5.16">witnesses possibly even Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="570.64" dur="5.49">herself by the way so lisa page being a</text>
  <text start="573.97" dur="4.44">cooperating witness there&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="576.13" dur="4.68">chance of it the third possibility is</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="4.65">that Durham&amp;#39;s investigation is just a</text>
  <text start="580.81" dur="3.63">sham and durham is doing nothing right</text>
  <text start="583.06" dur="4.23">and that would put the whole key</text>
  <text start="584.44" dur="6.09">movement in a bad situation that would</text>
  <text start="587.29" dur="5.64">pretty much debunk the q movement which</text>
  <text start="590.53" dur="4.71">has been pretty right all along so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="592.93" dur="5.13">gonna say that just off of my own</text>
  <text start="595.24" dur="6">personal experience not as a follower</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="4.8">but as somebody who you know III have it</text>
  <text start="601.24" dur="3.12">of a business mindset a bit of a</text>
  <text start="602.86" dur="3.48">business background you guys know I used</text>
  <text start="604.36" dur="5.31">to do real estate and such and I</text>
  <text start="606.34" dur="5.19">consider myself a savvy logical type of</text>

  <text start="1707.13" dur="3.6">have some sort of attempt to say that</text>
  <text start="1709.02" dur="3.72">he&amp;#39;s done something to punish Trump and</text>
  <text start="1710.73" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t care but it&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1712.74" dur="4.86">to see China has recently switched from</text>
  <text start="1714.96" dur="4.86">more face talks to more outright and</text>
  <text start="1717.6" dur="4.38">over threats you know in Chinese culture</text>
  <text start="1719.82" dur="3.78">you know if you&amp;#39;re making an overt</text>
  <text start="1721.98" dur="2.67">threat like we&amp;#39;re gonna destroy you for</text>
  <text start="1723.6" dur="4.38">doing this or something of that nature</text>
  <text start="1724.65" dur="5.52">or this could lead to this you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1727.98" dur="4.17">more of a sign of weakness whereas you</text>
  <text start="1730.17" dur="4.68">know maybe I don&amp;#39;t know what that is I</text>
  <text start="1732.15" dur="5.22">think that&amp;#39;s like pop-ups whereas maybe</text>
  <text start="1734.85" dur="5.34">you&amp;#39;re actually trying to show strength</text>
  <text start="1737.37" dur="4.44">and maybe you maybe you&amp;#39;re afraid but</text>
  <text start="1740.19" dur="3.93">you still show weakness right you still</text>
  <text start="1741.81" dur="4.32">say I don&amp;#39;t care I&amp;#39;m nonchalant that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1744.12" dur="3.69">Chinese face and if they lose that they</text>
  <text start="1746.13" dur="2.88">can be just like the left with the</text>
  <text start="1747.81" dur="3.84">victim thing they can be very violent</text>
  <text start="1749.01" dur="4.92">very vicious it&amp;#39;s very important to</text>
  <text start="1751.65" dur="4.26">Chinese culture to have that face I mean</text>
  <text start="1753.93" dur="3.99">I imagine that it would be right because</text>
  <text start="1755.91" dur="4.02">in Chinese culture if you&amp;#39;re unpopular</text>
  <text start="1757.92" dur="4.62">if you if you make the wrong enemy</text>
  <text start="1759.93" dur="4.65">socially you could be reported to the</text>
  <text start="1762.54" dur="5.52">government and organ harvested or</text>
  <text start="1764.58" dur="5.28">something so it kind of makes sense by</text>
  <text start="1768.06" dur="3.27">the way that&amp;#39;s why the u.s. is probably</text>
  <text start="1769.86" dur="2.67">a lot better at inventions even though</text>
  <text start="1771.33" dur="3.93">the Chinese people have a slightly</text>
  <text start="1772.53" dur="4.68">higher average IQ as we think outside</text>
  <text start="1775.26" dur="4.41">the box were encouraged to think outside</text>
  <text start="1777.21" dur="5.01">the box and be inventors to be to be</text>

  <text start="1782.22" dur="4.47">pioneers to be innovators to help people</text>
  <text start="1784.68" dur="3.81">in the world with with our businesses</text>

  <text start="1788.49" dur="4.5">helping people to help yourself</text>
  <text start="1790.65" dur="4.56">so that&amp;#39;s the kind of American mentality</text>
  <text start="1792.99" dur="5.37">at least in the past that created</text>
  <text start="1795.21" dur="5.16">American exceptionalism whereas China of</text>
  <text start="1798.36" dur="4.05">course just stills 300 plus billion</text>
  <text start="1800.37" dur="4.95">dollars in an IP from us every year</text>
  <text start="1802.41" dur="4.649">now China folds</text>
  <text start="1805.32" dur="5.219">article kind of backs me up on the idea</text>
  <text start="1807.059" dur="7.11">face they did nothing so far after Trump</text>
