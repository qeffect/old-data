  <text start="0.62" dur="4.84">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3" dur="6.78">most this is your daily manga &amp;amp; hu√©</text>
  <text start="5.46" dur="7.86">updates real fast I want to correct in a</text>
  <text start="9.78" dur="5.7">previous video I had said 80 billion for</text>
  <text start="13.32" dur="4.98">the number that was given to the</text>
  <text start="15.48" dur="5.19">military it was actually 700 billion and</text>
  <text start="18.3" dur="3.45">it was 80 billion more than was</text>
  <text start="20.67" dur="5.31">requested</text>
  <text start="21.75" dur="6.33">I just want to correct that for those</text>
  <text start="25.98" dur="4.43">who are following the senior executive</text>
  <text start="28.08" dur="4.71">service it is worth mentioning that</text>
  <text start="30.41" dur="5.47">President Trump could use the Hohmann</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="5.22">Act to reduce their pay to one dollar a</text>
  <text start="35.88" dur="6.24">year and that would clean house pretty</text>
  <text start="38.01" dur="5.97">quickly so it may be worth spreading</text>
  <text start="42.12" dur="3.709">that making it a viral let&amp;#39;s get the</text>
  <text start="43.98" dur="5.36">idea out there because we really want to</text>
  <text start="45.829" dur="6.701">inject that into a consciousness of the</text>
  <text start="49.34" dur="4.33">collective so to speak so that Trump</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="3.63">would feel a little bit more comfortable</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="5.4">using that option obviously if there is</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="4.86">already a massive talk of it going</text>
  <text start="59.07" dur="3.539">around then it makes it a lot easier for</text>
  <text start="61.02" dur="2.719">him to do something you know laterally</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="4.26">like that</text>
  <text start="63.739" dur="6.011">now Rosenstein who is just as guilty as</text>
  <text start="66.869" dur="4.771">mccabe and others has been subpoenaed he</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="5.64">either turns over all of the unredacted</text>
  <text start="71.64" dur="5.76">requested documents by April 5th or he</text>
  <text start="75.39" dur="6.72">is in contempt of Congress that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="77.4" dur="6.63">exciting and Zuckerberg basically</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="6.45">committed insider trading when he sold</text>
  <text start="84.03" dur="7.65">over 500 million as it shares or dollars</text>
  <text start="88.56" dur="7.32">I can&amp;#39;t recall off the top of my head of</text>
  <text start="91.68" dur="6.18">Facebook shares and it was right before</text>
  <text start="95.88" dur="5.099">the price tanked over his bad behavior</text>
  <text start="97.86" dur="4.59">selling people&amp;#39;s data basically so it</text>
  <text start="100.979" dur="3.481">may be worth injecting that one as well</text>
  <text start="102.45" dur="5.16">so we could possibly even see him go to</text>
  <text start="104.46" dur="8.07">jail it&amp;#39;s happened to other big players</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="6.84">in the past now because well I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="3.449">I&amp;#39;m gonna read a tweet from Trump</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="3.12">himself today and this is kind of a</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="4.471">biggie it goes to what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="5.31">talking about with the Q stuff and maybe</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="4.44">that if you watched my video yesterday</text>
  <text start="122.88" dur="5.01">maybe this was a Trojan horse this</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="5.16">omnibus thing was really just a genius</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="4.05">move from Trump because he got a lot of</text>
  <text start="130.05" dur="5.97">things he wanted in that bill</text>
  <text start="131.94" dur="5.97">so he says today because of the 707</text>
  <text start="136.02" dur="4.32">sixteen billion dollars gotten to</text>
  <text start="137.91" dur="4.79">rebuild our military many jobs are</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="5.69">created and our military is again rich</text>
  <text start="142.7" dur="6.22">building a great border wall with drugs</text>
  <text start="146.03" dur="4.9">poison and enemy combatants pouring into</text>
  <text start="148.92" dur="5.85">our country is all about National</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="7.79">Defense and then he says build the wall</text>
  <text start="154.77" dur="7.35">through em obviously him means military</text>
  <text start="158.72" dur="6.9">so maybe we were all over the truth</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="8.01">yesterday figuring out what he meant</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="7.15">what Q meant what Trump really dead when</text>
  <text start="170.13" dur="5.67">he tricked the Democrats into signing</text>
  <text start="172.77" dur="5.16">over basically funding for the wall</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="6">funding for a lot of other things if you</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="6.81">saw my video it expands the IG</text>
  <text start="181.8" dur="5.13">investigation it expands funding for a</text>
  <text start="184.74" dur="5.7">lot of things like a military tribunals</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="5.4">things like that so there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="190.44" dur="3.56">really good stuff in that bill guys it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.33" dur="4.53">not as bad as you think it is</text>
  <text start="194" dur="6.7">and it even forbids funding going to</text>
  <text start="196.86" dur="5.73">abortion so a lot of that talk of</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="6.71">funding Planned Parenthood is kind of a</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="7.26">non-starter really so this basically</text>
  <text start="207.41" dur="4.75">suggests that Trump is going to use</text>
  <text start="209.85" dur="4.02">National Defense as an excuse and all</text>
  <text start="212.16" dur="4.64">that money he just got for the military</text>
  <text start="213.87" dur="6.39">to have the military build the wall</text>
  <text start="216.8" dur="5.409">that&amp;#39;s a pretty big deal and Q had told</text>
  <text start="220.26" dur="5.16">us red castle green castle which</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="5.971">obviously is a reference to in my</text>
  <text start="225.42" dur="4.68">opinion most likely because it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="228.18" dur="4.2">specific a reference to the Army Corps</text>
  <text start="230.1" dur="5.03">of Engineers whose logo is a red castle</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="6.99">and who street address is green castle</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="6.82">so moving on a lot more is coming out</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="4.26">about Vegas guys all right</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="3.36">true pundit has been doing a lot of</text>
  <text start="243.63" dur="4.71">investigative work there they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="4.71">death threats laura Loomer has also been</text>
  <text start="248.34" dur="5.34">doing a lot of investigative work there</text>
  <text start="250.02" dur="6.54">and has also brought this topic up as</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="5.67">well there&amp;#39;s a guy named Brian Hodge</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="5.96">okay he he knew stuff he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="5.689">otherwise know he</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="4.399">he kind of fled the country he was</text>
  <text start="265.039" dur="4.291">blocked from being investigated by the</text>
  <text start="266.919" dur="4.81">the leadership in charge of the</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="5.04">investigation although the FBI agents</text>
  <text start="271.729" dur="5.91">underneath them still did it anyway so</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="6.69">there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff going on centered</text>
  <text start="277.639" dur="4.831">around this Brian Hodge guy who was an</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="4.59">Australian citizen but he was living</text>
  <text start="282.47" dur="10.62">here and Laura bloomer even says that he</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="9.66">met with a I think it was a its rape not</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="5.609">as it Raley no it was somebody from the</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="4.68">Middle East I think right after I guess</text>
  <text start="298.699" dur="3.481">I didn&amp;#39;t get it in my notes here but</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="3.69">right after the Vegas incident he</text>
  <text start="302.18" dur="7.169">basically left the country and met with</text>
  <text start="303.68" dur="7.68">this other guy so that is a basically a</text>
  <text start="309.349" dur="3.451">suspected second shooter at this point</text>
  <text start="311.36" dur="3.359">okay he knew things he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="4.14">otherwise know he claimed that he was in</text>
  <text start="314.719" dur="5.431">the room next to paddock that room also</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="5.64">had a window busted out just a lot of</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="4.62">weird stuff is going on folks so please</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="4.5">keep that name Brian Hodge in your</text>
  <text start="324.77" dur="3.989">thoughts and maybe do a little research</text>
  <text start="327.08" dur="2.97">on that true pun and has a great</text>
  <text start="328.759" dur="6.331">write-up on it I&amp;#39;m gonna include the</text>
  <text start="330.05" dur="7.83">link for you below there are craigslist</text>
  <text start="335.09" dur="5.79">ads coming out that we have seen now</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="5.779">where the march for our lives was</text>
  <text start="340.88" dur="7.68">basically getting paid up at $300 a day</text>
  <text start="343.659" dur="9.1">so these people are you know suspect of</text>
  <text start="348.56" dur="7.68">being paid protesters just like we saw</text>
  <text start="352.759" dur="7.71">with the anti fest off this is an</text>
  <text start="356.24" dur="7.079">ongoing recurring easily provable theme</text>
  <text start="360.469" dur="4.531">that we see pretty much anytime you see</text>
  <text start="363.319" dur="3.931">one of their events you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="365" dur="4.08">go look on Craigslist and all around the</text>
  <text start="367.25" dur="4.38">country and you&amp;#39;re gonna find offers to</text>
  <text start="369.08" dur="7.679">pay them to show up I&amp;#39;ve seen them as</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="6.33">high as $2,000 so $300 you know they did</text>
  <text start="376.759" dur="2.641">they didn&amp;#39;t even really get a good deal</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s not even worth that to go all the</text>
  <text start="379.4" dur="5.85">way to DC from places as far as Way of</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="6.389">Chicago and you know for a day of</text>
  <text start="385.25" dur="4.86">protesting and of course they littered</text>
  <text start="388.039" dur="3.93">and left a mess and couldn&amp;#39;t answer any</text>
  <text start="390.11" dur="4.109">questions from conservative journalists</text>
  <text start="391.969" dur="3.571">that could some of the videos that came</text>
  <text start="394.219" dur="3.151">out we were asking</text>
  <text start="395.54" dur="3.36">what is an assault rifle and nobody</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="4.05">could even explain it no one can even</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="4.98">define it so basically all they have is</text>
  <text start="401.42" dur="3.9">anger all they have is anger and emotion</text>
  <text start="403.88" dur="3.3">and this is what happens when we let</text>
  <text start="405.32" dur="5.64">children engage in politics this is the</text>
  <text start="407.18" dur="5.64">problem with democracy folks in a</text>
  <text start="410.96" dur="4.41">democracy if you have if you have five</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="4.5">kids and two parents well the five kids</text>

  <text start="421.43" dur="5.24">to school or do their homework okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="423.65" dur="5.82">not responsible that is exactly how</text>
  <text start="426.67" dur="5.79">democracies work in real life because</text>
  <text start="429.47" dur="2.99">most people are children</text>
  <text start="432.759" dur="6.12">now it&amp;#39;s also worth mentioning Hillary</text>
  <text start="436.389" dur="5.791">Clinton is praising the anti-gun</text>
  <text start="438.879" dur="4.801">marchers Cameron Caskey one of the</text>
  <text start="442.18" dur="8.069">surviving students that&amp;#39;s being pimped</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="12">out to the media as a emotional weapon</text>
  <text start="450.249" dur="8.34">as a attack on gun rights you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="7.799">basically just being exploited he is</text>
  <text start="458.589" dur="9.121">threatening lawmakers you know stand for</text>
  <text start="463.479" dur="8.25">us or beware one of the parkland</text>
  <text start="467.71" dur="6.929">students did a a speech</text>
  <text start="471.729" dur="4.74">her name is Delaney Tarr and she says</text>
  <text start="474.639" dur="2.52">that when they give us an inch we will</text>
  <text start="476.469" dur="4.41">take a mile</text>
  <text start="477.159" dur="6.961">and some of the students like Emma are</text>
  <text start="480.879" dur="4.56">even using some of the slain students</text>
  <text start="484.12" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re standing on the graves of some</text>
  <text start="485.439" dur="5.85">of these dead students in this case one</text>

  <text start="499.509" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t use my sister for this she would</text>
  <text start="502.029" dur="5.16">not end up as she did not it would not</text>
  <text start="504.039" dur="5.85">support your anti Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="507.189" dur="4.111">agenda it&amp;#39;s not gonna stop them of</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="5.721">course they&amp;#39;re gonna they&amp;#39;re gonna use</text>
  <text start="511.3" dur="7.289">the dead kids it&amp;#39;s political ammo and</text>
  <text start="515.61" dur="6.4">reminder that Hitler also used children</text>
  <text start="518.589" dur="9.271">to promote gun control now in a personal</text>
  <text start="522.01" dur="8.579">note I sense a little bit I sense that</text>
  <text start="527.86" dur="4.95">this whole gun thing is being pushed to</text>
  <text start="530.589" dur="3.781">a fever pitch now there we&amp;#39;re getting to</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="4.019">that talk of violence we&amp;#39;re getting to</text>
  <text start="534.37" dur="4.23">that talk of extremist viewpoints we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="536.829" dur="3.87">getting to that talk of I don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="4.25">about the right we need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="540.699" dur="4.411">their rights to own guns no matter what</text>
  <text start="542.85" dur="5.099">anything it takes that by any means</text>
  <text start="545.11" dur="7.55">necessary attitude and this is</text>
  <text start="547.949" dur="8.591">reminiscent of anti file and of course</text>
  <text start="552.66" dur="6.719">the Hitler Brownshirts mouths cultural</text>
  <text start="556.54" dur="5.539">revolutionaries just on and on and on</text>
  <text start="559.379" dur="6.14">you get these dumb people you get them</text>
  <text start="562.079" dur="7.56">hyped up on emotion and righteous zeal</text>
  <text start="565.519" dur="5.44">you lubricate them with money and you</text>
  <text start="569.639" dur="5.281">can get them to do just about anything</text>
  <text start="570.959" dur="10.761">so I really do sense that this is a</text>
  <text start="574.92" dur="9.449">legitimate push for violence and for I</text>
  <text start="581.72" dur="4.599">don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s going to end up that</text>
  <text start="584.369" dur="4.26">way I really hope it doesn&amp;#39;t I hope like</text>
  <text start="586.319" dur="4.71">antiph I kind of Peters out but remember</text>

  <text start="594.54" dur="3.81">just gotten some bad press and now</text>
  <text start="596.879" dur="6.361">they&amp;#39;re being a little bit more</text>
  <text start="598.35" dur="7.529">secretive we have to remember that these</text>
  <text start="603.24" dur="4.68">are enemy combatants they are waiting</text>
  <text start="605.879" dur="4.68">for an opportunity to kill us I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="6.089">telling you folks it is legitimately</text>
  <text start="610.559" dur="6.12">that dangerous if we for example were to</text>
  <text start="614.009" dur="4.52">lose our gun rights anti-fog would be</text>

  <text start="709.88" dur="6.48">giant blue queue like a physical object</text>
  <text start="713.3" dur="5.01">like a big toy queue or something that</text>
  <text start="716.36" dur="4.88">was left in his apartment which is</text>
  <text start="718.31" dur="5.22">actually under 24 guard at the</text>

  <text start="723.53" dur="5.25">community he lives in has armed security</text>
  <text start="725.62" dur="6.73">so somebody slipped in his apartment and</text>
  <text start="728.78" dur="6.86">left this blue cue with a note that says</text>
  <text start="732.35" dur="3.29">soon okay</text>

  <text start="744.49" dur="8.42">4q one of the posts that he had made</text>
  <text start="747.37" dur="7.77">saying the time will come when certain</text>

  <text start="760.57" dur="6.27">don&amp;#39;t know this is a stretch maybe to my</text>
  <text start="764.2" dur="5.24">mind but this does seem to imply that</text>
  <text start="766.84" dur="5.79">that post is coming to a fruition</text>
  <text start="769.44" dur="5.92">who knows with this at this point in the</text>
  <text start="772.63" dur="5.34">game I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t consider anything</text>
  <text start="775.36" dur="6.66">to be a coincidence anymore maybe I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="777.97" dur="5.85">little too paranoid about things but it</text>
  <text start="782.02" dur="4.02">does seem to be matching up I mean it</text>
  <text start="783.82" dur="5.88">really does the latest proofs that we</text>
  <text start="786.04" dur="5.88">have would be apparently cute predicting</text>
  <text start="789.7" dur="5.64">that trump was going to use the funds</text>
  <text start="791.92" dur="5.25">and the military to build the wall that</text>
  <text start="795.34" dur="4.64">really does seem to be shaping up now</text>
  <text start="797.17" dur="5.55">with Trump&amp;#39;s new tweet so there is just</text>
  <text start="799.98" dur="4.63">always more stuff going on in this and</text>
  <text start="802.72" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s hard to keep it up keep up with all</text>
  <text start="804.61" dur="6.6">of it but I hope you guys hope this kind</text>
  <text start="808.45" dur="4.76">of stirs your brain into thinking I hope</text>

  <text start="823.42" dur="2.82">mainstream</text>
  <text start="824.05" dur="5.73">obviously the qa9 thing really is</text>
  <text start="826.24" dur="6.42">already quite huge millions and millions</text>
  <text start="829.78" dur="8.25">of people organized for the first time</text>
  <text start="832.66" dur="8.4">and we have a an anonymous lead figure</text>
  <text start="838.03" dur="5.13">you might say with Q who basically just</text>
  <text start="841.06" dur="4.08">brings us information that&amp;#39;s really all</text>
  <text start="843.16" dur="4.35">he&amp;#39;s doing but he&amp;#39;s inspired people and</text>
  <text start="845.14" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a much bigger deal because</text>
  <text start="847.51" dur="3.78">the information is good but we already</text>
  <text start="849.91" dur="2.6">had people that were digging into the</text>
  <text start="851.29" dur="2.81">stuff we already had a lot of</text>
  <text start="852.51" dur="4.829">information</text>
  <text start="854.1" dur="6.9">what Q has done is bigger than that what</text>
  <text start="857.339" dur="11.221">Q has done is inspire millions of people</text>
  <text start="861" dur="10.62">to work together to organize a</text>
  <text start="868.56" dur="7.019">resistance movement a truther army you</text>
  <text start="871.62" dur="6.36">might say in the face of all this evil</text>
  <text start="875.579" dur="6.391">in the world and it really is working I</text>
  <text start="877.98" dur="8.81">have been on the internet watching</text>
  <text start="881.97" dur="4.82">everything unfold since I was a kid and</text>
  <text start="886.88" dur="4.03">it&amp;#39;s happening I felt the difference</text>
  <text start="889.5" dur="5.009">I&amp;#39;ve seen the difference I&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="890.91" dur="5.58">organization change I&amp;#39;ve seen the the</text>
  <text start="894.509" dur="6.421">mainstream media put on the defensive</text>
  <text start="896.49" dur="6.45">for the last year I have seen the the</text>
  <text start="900.93" dur="5.159">weapons formed against us that do not</text>
  <text start="902.94" dur="5.699">prosper so to speak every chance they</text>
  <text start="906.089" dur="5.521">try they pull out new things and most of</text>
  <text start="908.639" dur="4.771">them don&amp;#39;t work this gun rights thing is</text>
  <text start="911.61" dur="3.3">the most effective thing I&amp;#39;ve seen yet</text>
  <text start="913.41" dur="3.14">and it&amp;#39;s because a bunch of kids died</text>
  <text start="914.91" dur="5.039">and they&amp;#39;re gonna use that as a weapon</text>
  <text start="916.55" dur="4.99">but I don&amp;#39;t think most people are buying</text>
  <text start="919.949" dur="4.5">that either I think that they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="921.54" dur="4.859">using it to as an excuse to censor you</text>
  <text start="924.449" dur="5.64">know a pretense to censor and block</text>
  <text start="926.399" dur="6.36">channels like mine so</text>
  <text start="930.089" dur="4.021">you know it&amp;#39;s pretty much all positive</text>
  <text start="932.759" dur="3.57">at this point I don&amp;#39;t see anything</text>
  <text start="934.11" dur="4.979">negative I don&amp;#39;t really feel like the</text>
  <text start="936.329" dur="4.95">gun thing is gonna lead to a civil war</text>
  <text start="939.089" dur="4.92">but I do feel like it&amp;#39;s gonna lead to a</text>
  <text start="941.279" dur="4.41">lot more violence and hate from the left</text>
  <text start="944.009" dur="4.471">just when you thought that couldn&amp;#39;t hate</text>
  <text start="945.689" dur="5.4">anymore and we&amp;#39;ll see we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="948.48" dur="4.56">happens we do still have our guns so a</text>
  <text start="951.089" dur="3.781">civil war would be pretty pointless for</text>
  <text start="953.04" dur="4.169">them</text>
  <text start="954.87" dur="3.3">in fact honestly in the long run I</text>
  <text start="957.209" dur="2.43">actually think it&amp;#39;d be better for the</text>
  <text start="958.17" dur="3.99">country if they did try something like</text>
  <text start="959.639" dur="6.12">that because we would we would have a</text>
  <text start="962.16" dur="5.099">lesson that we all had to learn from it</text>
  <text start="965.759" dur="3.3">wouldn&amp;#39;t it wouldn&amp;#39;t just be the</text>
  <text start="967.259" dur="4.291">truthers versus the zealots on the</text>
  <text start="969.059" dur="3.75">Communist side it would be everyone</text>
  <text start="971.55" dur="3.3">would then be involved and it would</text>
  <text start="972.809" dur="3.57">force them to wake up obviously I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="974.85" dur="5.459">want violence I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="976.379" dur="6.63">anybody to get hurt but I don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="980.309" dur="5.851">we could lose either way in the long run</text>
