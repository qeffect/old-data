  <text start="6.75" dur="5.04">and I want to talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="9.269" dur="4.591">good news and censorship so a while back</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="4.95">Trump had finally made a comment about</text>
  <text start="13.86" dur="4.44">censorship and now he&amp;#39;s followed it up</text>
  <text start="16.74" dur="3">with three more I&amp;#39;m gonna put them on</text>
  <text start="18.3" dur="3.53">the screen so that you can read them but</text>
  <text start="19.74" dur="4.77">follow along with me here</text>
  <text start="21.83" dur="4.63">social media is totally discriminating</text>
  <text start="24.51" dur="4.019">its Republican / conservative voices</text>
  <text start="26.46" dur="4.469">speaking loudly and clearly for the</text>
  <text start="28.529" dur="3.271">Trump administration we won&amp;#39;t let that</text>
  <text start="30.929" dur="3.15">happen</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="4.38">they are closing down the opinions of</text>
  <text start="34.079" dur="5.041">many people on the right while at the</text>
  <text start="36.18" dur="5.399">same time doing nothing to others too</text>
  <text start="39.12" dur="4.38">many voices are being destroyed some</text>
  <text start="41.579" dur="4.201">good and some bad and that cannot be</text>
  <text start="43.5" dur="4.35">allowed to happen who is making the</text>
  <text start="45.78" dur="3.799">choices because I can already tell you</text>
  <text start="47.85" dur="4.619">that too many mistakes are being made</text>
  <text start="49.579" dur="4.601">let everybody participate good and bad</text>
  <text start="52.469" dur="3.84">and we will just have to figure it out</text>
  <text start="54.18" dur="4.41">now this is obviously in relation to all</text>
  <text start="56.309" dur="4.441">these accidents like happen to Prager</text>
  <text start="58.59" dur="3.93">University but these accidents always</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="3.54">fall on the wrong side of the</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="3.56">partisanship line it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="5.369">Republicans that suffer from this stuff</text>
  <text start="66.08" dur="5.26">now continuing on he says censorship is</text>
  <text start="69.659" dur="3.841">a very dangerous thing and absolutely</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="4.26">impossible to police if you are weeding</text>
  <text start="73.5" dur="5.61">out fake news there is nothing so fake</text>
  <text start="75.6" dur="5.339">as CNN and MSNBC and yet I do not ask</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="3.93">that their sick behavior be removed I</text>
  <text start="80.939" dur="6.091">get used to it and watch with a grain of</text>

  <text start="326.74" dur="4.019">a nice way if they attack us I mean you</text>
  <text start="328.599" dur="4.5">brutally put them down in self-defense</text>

  <text start="342.49" dur="3.51">the ground I&amp;#39;m gonna punch them in the</text>
  <text start="343.719" dur="4.23">throat and run away okay I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="346" dur="4.319">violence but I&amp;#39;m fully capable of</text>
  <text start="347.949" dur="4.261">defending myself so for those out there</text>
  <text start="350.319" dur="3.481">who think I&amp;#39;m a wimp because I&amp;#39;m polite</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="2.609">you know hey that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just not the</text>
  <text start="353.8" dur="2.82">case</text>
  <text start="354.819" dur="4.051">I can politely punch you in the throat</text>
  <text start="356.62" dur="4.019">if you attack me and that&amp;#39;s just how it</text>
  <text start="358.87" dur="3.06">is because I&amp;#39;m a I&amp;#39;m not a pacifist but</text>
  <text start="360.639" dur="3.75">I do believe in the non-aggression</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="5.78">principle that is not what I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="364.389" dur="6.661">say here what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is that</text>
  <text start="367.71" dur="4.989">you we have to understand you know that</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="3.869">they are not really the root of the</text>
  <text start="372.699" dur="5.011">problem they are a symptom of a sick</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="5.25">culture of propaganda and damaged brains</text>
  <text start="377.71" dur="4.5">and there may not be anything that we</text>
  <text start="380.169" dur="3.541">can do to save them and it may be that</text>
  <text start="382.21" dur="3.78">it really does come down to just</text>
  <text start="383.71" dur="4.17">self-defense until they&amp;#39;re gone okay if</text>
  <text start="385.99" dur="4.08">they really do want to go full riot and</text>
  <text start="387.88" dur="5.07">full attack and everything else then by</text>
  <text start="390.07" dur="4.68">all means take them out but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="392.95" dur="3.69">violence and I don&amp;#39;t call for violence</text>
  <text start="394.75" dur="3.33">and I think that the appropriate ways to</text>
  <text start="396.64" dur="5.37">kill them with kindness you know use</text>
  <text start="398.08" dur="6.03">love and use politeness and you know</text>
  <text start="402.01" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s how you win that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="5.64">effect of that&amp;#39;s the most effective</text>
  <text start="407.44" dur="5.19">route to win like if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="409.75" dur="4.8">out there shouting insults or exchanging</text>
  <text start="412.63" dur="3.51">you know insults with these people</text>
  <text start="414.55" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;re not gonna win any of them over</text>
  <text start="416.14" dur="2.4">what you&amp;#39;re probably not gonna do anyway</text>
  <text start="417.46" dur="2.46">but you&amp;#39;re not gonna win any of the</text>
  <text start="418.54" dur="2.85">people watching the fence over either</text>
  <text start="419.92" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s just gonna look like two people</text>
  <text start="421.39" dur="4.8">fighting and being immature so just</text>
  <text start="424.3" dur="3.21">remember that we&amp;#39;re diplomats right</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;re diplomats from Agra</text>
  <text start="427.51" dur="7.05">we&amp;#39;re diplomats for cue and we need to</text>
  <text start="430.54" dur="6.03">be the better and bigger person while</text>
  <text start="434.56" dur="3.6">also still sticking up for ourselves and</text>
  <text start="436.57" dur="4.65">still defending ourselves and this is a</text>
  <text start="438.16" dur="5.52">war and we should we should not hold</text>
  <text start="441.22" dur="4.04">punches we should go full force and I</text>
  <text start="443.68" dur="4.74">mean that metaphorically of course</text>
  <text start="445.26" dur="4.69">because in the case of like Twitter and</text>
  <text start="448.42" dur="2.82">stuff I&amp;#39;m not saying we should just take</text>
  <text start="449.95" dur="3.27">this laying down I&amp;#39;m so we should</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="4.02">lawsuit we should we should we should</text>
  <text start="453.22" dur="3.78">protest we should spread the word we</text>
  <text start="455.26" dur="3.48">should call them out we should expose</text>
  <text start="457" dur="4.56">them by name and everything and not</text>
  <text start="458.74" dur="4.65">daxing but expose the people who are</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="5.61">under their own names doing these kind</text>
  <text start="463.39" dur="5.52">of things insulting and threatening and</text>
  <text start="467.17" dur="4.32">the fake news people like I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
