  <text start="76.59" dur="4.169">start you know there was the the DC trip</text>
  <text start="79.14" dur="3.479">obviously that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve been kind of</text>
  <text start="80.759" dur="6.331">you know in my a for a while</text>
  <text start="82.619" dur="10.11">we have Epstein arrested I mean I could</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="7.709">say surprise but I&amp;#39;m not surprised</text>
  <text start="92.729" dur="5.241">you know we&amp;#39;ve expected this for quite a</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="7.11">while he&amp;#39;s just one of those cylinders</text>
  <text start="97.97" dur="6.039">we&amp;#39;re up to what a hundred thousand and</text>
  <text start="101.909" dur="5.21">you guys know exactly what that means</text>
  <text start="104.009" dur="6.211">right like Epstein is a doorway to</text>
  <text start="107.119" dur="6.161">probably hundreds of other major</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="6.96">influencer or influential type people</text>
  <text start="113.28" dur="6.089">powerful political figures or just like</text>
  <text start="117.18" dur="4.64">the Clintons those types low ballistic</text>
  <text start="119.369" dur="4.921">of all types pedophile types</text>
  <text start="121.82" dur="6.909">that&amp;#39;s basically what Epstein island was</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="5.85">about was a hopefully because the worst</text>
  <text start="128.729" dur="3.991">is actually could could be even worse</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="3.12">than this but at the very best it was a</text>
  <text start="132.72" dur="3.349">place</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="5.929">brought in children to blackmail and</text>
  <text start="136.069" dur="5.711">videotape powerful people doing things</text>
  <text start="139.189" dur="7.121">worst case they were they were killing</text>
  <text start="141.78" dur="6.84">some of the kids too but that&amp;#39;s no fun</text>
  <text start="146.31" dur="7.41">to talk about so at least he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="7.14">down and that is a major doorway to some</text>
  <text start="153.72" dur="5.87">others I suspect we&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="155.76" dur="3.83">seeing some suicides or something a</text>
  <text start="160.19" dur="6.879">phenomenon what&amp;#39;s that buddy and if you</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="5.339">guys I know many of you don&amp;#39;t check</text>
  <text start="167.069" dur="5.73">Twitter a lot I have recently put up a</text>
  <text start="170.849" dur="4.23">bunch of photos from the trip on there</text>
  <text start="172.799" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;ll have to maybe put them into an</text>
  <text start="175.079" dur="5.13">actual video at some point for us to to</text>
  <text start="178.379" dur="2.821">share on YouTube as well it was it was</text>
  <text start="180.209" dur="3.211">neat I get to meet a lot of interesting</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="4.649">people like Gavin McGinnis and I saw</text>
  <text start="183.42" dur="5.879">Laura Loomer again and actually made</text>
  <text start="185.849" dur="5.101">some interesting new friends and got to</text>
  <text start="189.299" dur="5">see some old ones like Craig it just</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="6.27">informed talk I met Eric Cochran from</text>
  <text start="194.299" dur="4.571">Pinterest whistleblower he&amp;#39;s over there</text>
  <text start="197.22" dur="8.46">working in Veritas now which is really</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="8.88">cool ran into an Tifa that was kind of</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="5.399">interesting you know they at one point</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="6.269">they actually tried to send off Italians</text>
  <text start="211.079" dur="5.52">to find a way to probe into a weakness</text>
  <text start="214.019" dur="5.161">to get into the area where we were which</text>
  <text start="216.599" dur="3.51">was interesting to see like a</text>
  <text start="219.18" dur="3.059">street-level</text>
  <text start="220.109" dur="4.761">enemy force making a move against you</text>
  <text start="222.239" dur="5.161">like it activates all sorts of like</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="4.44">instincts you know you just start</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="3.839">looking around over your shoulder a lot</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="3.31">because you don&amp;#39;t know which one of</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="4.83">these guys are gonna run up on you with</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="5.13">a lock and there were some among us you</text>
  <text start="236.069" dur="3.901">know over there basically making threats</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="5.28">but yeah we were pretty much safe</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="6.9">because the proud boys group was there</text>
  <text start="243.03" dur="6.48">actually and you know I don&amp;#39;t know their</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="5.459">full story but what I know is that they</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="3.71">showed up to defend conservatives from a</text>
  <text start="252.329" dur="3.84">antifa</text>
  <text start="253.22" dur="4.419">like a year after and and nothing</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="4.171">against them I mean conservatives were</text>
  <text start="257.639" dur="4.921">very very late to the violence party and</text>
  <text start="260.34" dur="3.24">were very hesitant to do violence but</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="2.92">they&amp;#39;re very good at it</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="6.16">so these guys were kind of keeping</text>
  <text start="265.48" dur="6.36">nice and actually one of those it was</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="4.2">some kind of like guy that was angry at</text>
  <text start="271.84" dur="4.62">Jewish people was there and he rushed</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="4.17">the stage with his flagpole and it was</text>
  <text start="276.46" dur="4.08">like me and one other or two other guys</text>
  <text start="278.11" dur="5.1">there that stopped him right between him</text>
  <text start="280.54" dur="5.84">and the stage - that was neat I like</text>
  <text start="283.21" dur="6">those guys for the most part though so</text>
  <text start="286.38" dur="4.36">you know that was an interesting thing I</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="4.89">wasn&amp;#39;t too worried about the mt4 the</text>
  <text start="290.74" dur="6.57">police did their job which is wonderful</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="4.92">and I honor them for it but it is a bit</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="4.89">weird that you have to say that like</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s a big deal in today&amp;#39;s world I mean</text>
  <text start="302.2" dur="3.09">obviously you go somewhere like Portland</text>
  <text start="303.67" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re just gonna get the kicked</text>
  <text start="305.29" dur="6.84">out of you and the police would probably</text>
  <text start="306.64" dur="6.78">let it happen if not encourage it as</text>
  <text start="312.13" dur="5.36">they did in Charlottesville</text>
  <text start="313.42" dur="7.74">they kettled people into the violence so</text>
  <text start="317.49" dur="5.8">moving on from those topics an Tifa</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="4.59">failed to really do anything other than</text>
  <text start="323.29" dur="5.67">make a scene a couple times get arrested</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="7.32">few of them burn a flag and have it</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="6.12">taken away from them and basically just</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="4.26">give us more reason to know that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="4.23">doing the right thing now they were</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="6.45">there in much greater number but it now</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s DC and we have jobs and such but I</text>
  <text start="343.78" dur="3.86">would you know it was a fun experience</text>
  <text start="345.49" dur="6.51">and afterwards there was actually this</text>
  <text start="347.64" dur="7.12">VIP kind of a after-party / social</text>
  <text start="352" dur="5.04">networking event and it was an</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="6.27">undisclosed location so I actually had</text>
  <text start="357.04" dur="6.75">to go to Trump Hotel at a certain time</text>
  <text start="361.03" dur="3.81">to get a bus to a secret location and I</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="2.61">still don&amp;#39;t even know where it was</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="4.05">because when I got there was raining and</text>
  <text start="366.4" dur="5.1">I didn&amp;#39;t even bother to look just kind</text>
  <text start="368.89" dur="4.26">of rushed indoors but that&amp;#39;s the kind of</text>
  <text start="371.5" dur="3.45">stuff you have to do because anti-fur</text>
  <text start="373.15" dur="5.01">are out there looking to find you and</text>
  <text start="374.95" dur="4.38">kill you that night so there are you</text>
  <text start="378.16" dur="5.04">know obviously you need the leaders the</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="5.82">speakers at the event they were on the</text>
  <text start="383.2" dur="6.63">list in fact one of those antiva tried</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="7.11">to get into the speaker&amp;#39;s bus while they</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="4.47">were speaking imagine the damage one of</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="4.51">them could have done just a knife or</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="6.16">something so</text>
  <text start="396.77" dur="7.769">um you know it was a great after party</text>

  <text start="425.77" dur="7">the entire plaza I mean it was a sea of</text>
  <text start="429.349" dur="5.461">people a sea of Patriots and they tried</text>
  <text start="432.77" dur="5.91">to say poor turnout but it looked just</text>
  <text start="434.81" dur="9.84">like inauguration day again and that was</text>
  <text start="438.68" dur="7.44">pretty cool to see it to hear it and</text>

  <text start="2037.33" dur="7.59">time but we have to work together we</text>
  <text start="2043.48" dur="6.78">have to form organizations of our own</text>

  <text start="2050.26" dur="6.03">completely like you told us to</text>
  <text start="2052.36" dur="5.309">and the fake McGrath the Trojan matica</text>

  <text start="2057.669" dur="4.291">waters and they are lying that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2060.34" dur="5.15">most damaging thing of all I think to</text>
  <text start="2061.96" dur="3.53">getting justice for people like Epstein</text>
  <text start="2066.659" dur="6.401">what would you what would you think of</text>

  <text start="2073.06" dur="5.369">you don&amp;#39;t have to answer but kind of a</text>
  <text start="2075.82" dur="5.64">rhetorical even would it be more</text>
  <text start="2078.429" dur="5.191">damaging if Alex Jones came out and said</text>
  <text start="2081.46" dur="6.3">well we looked in the Epstein it turns</text>
  <text start="2083.62" dur="8.61">out he didn&amp;#39;t do anything but you know</text>
  <text start="2087.76" dur="6.889">sorry or CNN came out and said he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2092.23" dur="5.85">completely innocent this is a lie by</text>
  <text start="2094.649" dur="6.811">conservatives a conspiracy theory what</text>
  <text start="2098.08" dur="3.38">do you think would do more damage to</text>

  <text start="2132.53" dur="7.68">Tiger but I think you guys get the idea</text>
  <text start="2137.41" dur="5.56">like everybody already assumes that if</text>
  <text start="2140.21" dur="3.899">CNN says one or like up then it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2142.97" dur="3.3">gone because they&amp;#39;re liars</text>
