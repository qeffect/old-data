  <text start="43.78" dur="3.75">available different you know kind of a</text>
  <text start="45.46" dur="4.5">basic model this one was custom actually</text>
  <text start="47.53" dur="4.919">handmade the Hat itself that the</text>
  <text start="49.96" dur="4.559">additions by john merrick of the</text>
  <text start="52.449" dur="3.93">original white hat movement he actually</text>
  <text start="54.519" dur="3.57">kind of passed the torch to me for what</text>
  <text start="56.379" dur="5.701">we&amp;#39;re doing now with the stop it burning</text>
  <text start="58.089" dur="5.761">in and some of the other projects but we</text>
  <text start="62.08" dur="3.719">want to talk about censorship we want to</text>
  <text start="63.85" dur="4.35">talk about things like hue being</text>
  <text start="65.799" dur="5.461">censored the chants being shut down this</text>
  <text start="68.2" dur="4.74">kind of power moves and pressure being</text>
  <text start="71.26" dur="3.96">put out on people and things like that</text>
  <text start="72.94" dur="3.09">but i also want to talk about the news</text>
  <text start="75.22" dur="3.42">of the day</text>
  <text start="76.03" dur="6.09">so apparently Jeffrey Epstein has</text>
  <text start="78.64" dur="5.04">committed suicide now I was shocked to</text>
  <text start="82.12" dur="4.01">hear this and I&amp;#39;m sure he was also</text>
  <text start="83.68" dur="2.45">shocked</text>
  <text start="90.93" dur="9.84">I promise I won&amp;#39;t do that often but I</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="3.21">had to do it every once in a while I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="4.44">still learning to use some of these</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="5.07">things anyway I&amp;#39;m sure he was shocked</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="4.68">because clearly he didn&amp;#39;t want to commit</text>
  <text start="107.13" dur="6.39">suicide his appeal was still pending</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="6.48">this was a hit and the circumstances</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="7.04">around it we&amp;#39;ll dive into that as well</text>
  <text start="116.37" dur="7.59">so let&amp;#39;s do that let&amp;#39;s jump right in</text>
  <text start="120.56" dur="5.83">so some of those circumstances</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="5.45">apparently his suicide watch was</text>
  <text start="126.39" dur="6.96">apparently just just lifted right before</text>
  <text start="129.41" dur="5.53">he died that&amp;#39;s not suspicious at all not</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="3.45">long after he threatened to kill himself</text>
  <text start="134.94" dur="3.84">things like that as well remember and</text>
  <text start="136.8" dur="5.61">you know to be fair maybe it was his</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.83">time maybe it was pre scheduled and then</text>
  <text start="142.41" dur="1.71">they were just waiting for that time to</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="2.22">strike</text>
  <text start="144.12" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;d be pretty easy to find that out</text>
  <text start="145.83" dur="7.41">right but I doubt it it&amp;#39;s all too much</text>
  <text start="148.17" dur="9.09">coincidence for me we also have trying</text>
  <text start="153.24" dur="5.73">to not get too much out of order Epstein</text>
  <text start="157.26" dur="4.79">actually told authorities someone tried</text>
  <text start="158.97" dur="7.08">to kill him in previous incident in July</text>
  <text start="162.05" dur="6.4">so that&amp;#39;s you know not surprising at all</text>
  <text start="166.05" dur="6.03">especially being who he is what he has</text>
  <text start="168.45" dur="7.17">done and what he is I guess and where he</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="6.8">was by people I mean I just don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="6.119">that something this important would just</text>
  <text start="178.88" dur="5.74">go to a normal prison cell or something</text>
  <text start="181.739" dur="6.571">and then clearly be a targetable an</text>
  <text start="184.62" dur="5.369">easily easily targetable victim not that</text>
  <text start="188.31" dur="3.78">he&amp;#39;s a much of a victim but we needed</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="4.261">him alive you know this is a bad day</text>
  <text start="192.09" dur="5.49">this is a dark day for truth because you</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="5.94">know he has a lot he could he can rat on</text>
  <text start="197.58" dur="5.58">you know he has first-hand experience</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="4.47">I am fully okay with him being given the</text>
  <text start="203.16" dur="4.109">death penalty I just want to take down</text>
  <text start="204.66" dur="5.88">all the other ones he knows now we also</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="5.461">have a G bar saying he&amp;#39;s appalled and</text>
  <text start="210.54" dur="5.43">statements on investigations into</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="5.85">Epstein&amp;#39;s and death so this is getting</text>
  <text start="215.97" dur="6.72">very suspicious and people know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.58" dur="5.159">going on I think it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious you</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="1.53">sometimes you have to read between the</text>
  <text start="223.739" dur="2.191">lines</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="3.57">this is the kind of stuff my like linky</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;re in a mafia movie because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="4.68">really the way the world works in among</text>
  <text start="230.82" dur="3.33">those who have power it&amp;#39;s really a law</text>
  <text start="232.47" dur="5.25">of the jungle thing to varying degrees</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="6.69">and that means it&amp;#39;s a varying degrees of</text>
  <text start="237.72" dur="5.28">honor and in kind of a mafia world you</text>
  <text start="240.84" dur="3.78">know in this case if you think of it</text>
  <text start="243" dur="3.21">that way it becomes very easy to believe</text>
  <text start="244.62" dur="3.9">that someone who has a lot of dirt on</text>
  <text start="246.21" dur="4.17">very powerful people and it&amp;#39;s all coming</text>
  <text start="248.52" dur="3.78">out right now victims are saying yeah</text>
  <text start="250.38" dur="3.9">yeah he did it and all these other very</text>
  <text start="252.3" dur="4.62">important people did it as well and oh</text>
  <text start="254.28" dur="4.86">yeah and Trump didn&amp;#39;t so we&amp;#39;ll talk</text>
  <text start="256.92" dur="3.93">about that as well but this is all kind</text>
  <text start="259.14" dur="5.04">of imploding for them and he is a</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="6.93">liability so of course he was taken out</text>
  <text start="264.18" dur="8.27">I was shocked by that right now we also</text>
  <text start="267.78" dur="6.93">have some other things going on just</text>
  <text start="272.45" dur="6.4">Epstein found dead in this prison cell</text>
  <text start="274.71" dur="8.13">right after Democrats are implicated so</text>
  <text start="278.85" dur="7.89">like I said top people you know here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.84" dur="6.39">an example anyway so Virginia jew-free I</text>
  <text start="286.74" dur="3.78">think I said that right and and of</text>
  <text start="289.23" dur="3.93">course there&amp;#39;s other things coming out</text>
  <text start="290.52" dur="4.56">but basically some of the hot you know</text>
  <text start="293.16" dur="3.75">points that have come out recently is</text>
  <text start="295.08" dur="4.98">that Bill Clinton held a private party</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="5.819">on Jeffery Epstein&amp;#39;s Peto Island one</text>
  <text start="300.06" dur="5.43">former sex slave met Al Gore through web</text>
  <text start="302.729" dur="4.411">stings close aide and this is some of</text>
  <text start="305.49" dur="4.11">those unsealed documents they&amp;#39;re not all</text>
  <text start="307.14" dur="4.23">out yet by the way but some of them did</text>
  <text start="309.6" dur="5.01">come out and then of course former</text>
  <text start="311.37" dur="4.71">Democrat leaders senators George I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="4.559">sorry senator George Mitchell and</text>
  <text start="316.08" dur="5.19">governor bill Richardson allegedly</text>
  <text start="319.169" dur="4.56">partied with Epstein on his island as</text>
  <text start="321.27" dur="5.67">well so there&amp;#39;s you know there&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="323.729" dur="5.701">whole lot of dirt coming out on powerful</text>
  <text start="326.94" dur="7.17">people and then suddenly it&amp;#39;s convenient</text>
  <text start="329.43" dur="6.54">dead I think that buzzing is back it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="5.85">always like a challenge with the</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="6.48">technology I was never the strongest</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="6.57">youtuber when it comes to audio tech or</text>
  <text start="342.45" dur="5.49">video tech I&amp;#39;m a low tech guy I prefer</text>
  <text start="346.53" dur="4.949">to be out there with the chickens anyway</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="5.28">so moving on after Epstein&amp;#39;s death mcc</text>
  <text start="351.479" dur="3.801">guard won&amp;#39;t even answer if the our</text>
  <text start="353.22" dur="4.97">cameras in the cells Cassandra</text>
  <text start="355.28" dur="5.37">Fairbanks and NYC so of course she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="358.19" dur="4.199">always really on spot really fast and</text>
  <text start="360.65" dur="3.3">she takes a lot of risks putting herself</text>
  <text start="362.389" dur="3.661">out there with some of the the</text>
  <text start="363.95" dur="3.75">high-profile and and kind of I would say</text>
  <text start="366.05" dur="4.14">high risk stories that she&amp;#39;s covering</text>
  <text start="367.7" dur="4.29">like this but she&amp;#39;s out there pretty</text>
  <text start="370.19" dur="3.21">quick and she&amp;#39;s grilling the guards</text>
  <text start="371.99" dur="3.06">people are shutting up they&amp;#39;re clamming</text>
  <text start="373.4" dur="5.25">up they don&amp;#39;t want to talk everyone</text>
  <text start="375.05" dur="5.43">knows what happens they just saw it it</text>
  <text start="378.65" dur="3.66">would not surprise me if we don&amp;#39;t find a</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="4.5">lot of people that now want to talk ever</text>
  <text start="382.31" dur="7.32">anywhere if we can&amp;#39;t even keep Epstein</text>
  <text start="384.98" dur="8.7">alive in this one case so this is a dark</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="5.43">day for truthers I think but not all</text>
  <text start="393.68" dur="3.63">dark there&amp;#39;s other stuff now we also</text>

  <text start="576.74" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s pretty powerful to the Democrat</text>
  <text start="578.69" dur="4.35">narrative where they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
