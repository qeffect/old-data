  <text start="71.82" dur="6.03">that powered players pass lies for truth</text>
  <text start="74.399" dur="5.551">and truth for lies especially in areas</text>
  <text start="77.85" dur="5.31">of life and hell I used to stay quiet</text>

  <text start="113.78" dur="3.869">we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and leave in with that</text>
  <text start="114.859" dur="5.161">the IG report proves Obama officials</text>
  <text start="117.649" dur="4.5">abused their Feist a power to trigger an</text>

  <text start="127.64" dur="6.629">against Trump these crooked bureaucrats</text>
  <text start="131.36" dur="5.82">must be held accountable so that&amp;#39;s from</text>
  <text start="134.269" dur="4.741">Steve Scalise himself and a little side</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="3.45">note for the folks who are following the</text>
  <text start="139.01" dur="5.339">Q movement there&amp;#39;s actually a few hidden</text>
  <text start="140.63" dur="5.969">gems within this report one of which is</text>
  <text start="144.349" dur="4.461">if you search for call me</text>
  <text start="146.599" dur="5.97">the typical Spelling nothing shows up</text>
  <text start="148.81" dur="6.73">excuse me but if you search for corn or</text>
  <text start="152.569" dur="6.841">corny the way that Q usually spells call</text>
  <text start="155.54" dur="7.02">me with the O R in instead of the OM e</text>
  <text start="159.41" dur="5.46">so you get that call me look without it</text>
  <text start="162.56" dur="4.8">actually saying call me you have to kind</text>
  <text start="164.87" dur="4.11">of see really closely and maybe you guys</text>
  <text start="167.36" dur="5.099">can tell right there where the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.98" dur="5.49">a circle but corny looks like call me</text>
  <text start="172.459" dur="4.59">but it&amp;#39;s spelled differently now if you</text>
  <text start="174.47" dur="6.06">type in corn or corny it brings up all</text>
  <text start="177.049" dur="5.671">of the examples of Comey within the text</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="4.829">so you guys may have in the past</text>
  <text start="182.72" dur="5.34">searched a document you can do that with</text>
  <text start="185.359" dur="5.011">a the find feature and type in like a</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="5.19">name or a specific word you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="190.37" dur="4.83">highlighter or zoom to and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="193.25" dur="5.73">convenient feature well in doing that</text>
  <text start="195.2" dur="6.3">with the IG report try it out also it</text>
  <text start="198.98" dur="5.64">turns out that if you I think praying</text>
  <text start="201.5" dur="5.519">medic found this if you search a link at</text>
  <text start="204.62" dur="5.25">the very bottom it&amp;#39;s a government link</text>
  <text start="207.019" dur="5.37">at the very bottom some of the peas I</text>
  <text start="209.87" dur="5.06">believe turn into cues when you actually</text>
  <text start="212.389" dur="5.341">copy/paste it over so you copy a see</text>
  <text start="214.93" dur="5.589">from this document and then it turns</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="5.28">into a cue I&amp;#39;m sorry you copy a P and</text>
  <text start="220.519" dur="5.791">then it turns into a cue after you paste</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="5.67">it so it&amp;#39;s very interesting and and all</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="3.959">of these little gemstones from the cue</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="3.179">movement are always kind of fascinating</text>
  <text start="230.269" dur="4.291">and of course is that just another</text>
  <text start="231.859" dur="6.061">coincidence I&amp;#39;m not sure and of course</text>
  <text start="234.56" dur="5.18">also I think 17 the number came up in</text>
  <text start="237.92" dur="4.22">this as well as some of the</text>
  <text start="239.74" dur="5.13">I think the number of the abuses so</text>
  <text start="242.14" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a lot of little cue references</text>
  <text start="244.87" dur="4.95">here and this is of course another</text>
  <text start="246.7" dur="4.35">future Bruce past situation where Hugh</text>
  <text start="249.82" dur="5.19">has been talking about the IG report</text>
  <text start="251.05" dur="7.2">since before anyone before it even</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="6.36">started I think we also have from</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="5.19">Jennifer Franco here on Twitter breaking</text>
  <text start="261.37" dur="5.88">US Attorney John Durham issues a</text>
  <text start="263.44" dur="6.03">response to the DOJ IG report saying his</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="4.56">office does not agree with some of the</text>
  <text start="269.47" dur="5.37">reports for conclusions asked to</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="6.24">predication and how the FBI case was</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="5.73">opened so you know Durham is of course</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="6.39">the one that has the the ability to</text>
  <text start="280.57" dur="6.57">issue indictments and arrests and IG</text>
  <text start="284.44" dur="5.91">Horowitz was just kind of kind of the B</text>
  <text start="287.14" dur="4.83">B team on this as I see it and also we</text>
  <text start="290.35" dur="3.96">have a G bar here saying that</text>
  <text start="291.97" dur="5.57">surveillance of Trump campaign is a</text>
  <text start="294.31" dur="6.18">clear abuse of the FISA process and</text>
  <text start="297.54" dur="6.34">finalized we&amp;#39;ll get president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="5.37">own reaction here and you know I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="3.48">gonna say that everyone&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="3.69">exactly what they wanted we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="307.36" dur="4.23">expecting really big bombshells and I</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="4.17">think we got a lot of that I think we</text>
  <text start="311.59" dur="4.2">did get a lot of positive stuff from the</text>
  <text start="313.72" dur="4.17">IG report I don&amp;#39;t think is everything we</text>
  <text start="315.79" dur="5.52">wanted and I think that Huber and Barr</text>
  <text start="317.89" dur="5.64">and what comes out next will clarify and</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="4.8">add greater context to what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="323.53" dur="5.01">already got but hey we&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="9.66">winning ELISA I think I&amp;#39;m gonna play you</text>
  <text start="328.54" dur="8.76">one more a little sound here I love</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="3.03">these I&amp;#39;m just having fun with them now</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="2.37">but let me show you guys what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="338.8" dur="3.51">talking about here</text>
  <text start="339.67" dur="5.58">well they fabricated evidence and they</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="5.76">lied to the courts and they did all</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="7.26">sorts of things to have it go their way</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="7.68">and this was something that we can never</text>
  <text start="352.51" dur="4.86">allow happen again the report actually</text>
  <text start="355.75" dur="3.48">and especially when you look into it in</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="3.039">the details of the report are far worse</text>
  <text start="359.23" dur="4.63">than anything I would</text>
  <text start="360.409" dur="6.24">even imagined what they were doing and</text>
  <text start="363.86" dur="4.589">what they would have done if I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="366.649" dur="4.2">make a certain move a certain move that</text>
  <text start="368.449" dur="4.68">was a very important move because it</text>
  <text start="370.849" dur="2.91">would have been even worse if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.129" dur="3.451">possible</text>
  <text start="373.759" dur="5.071">and they might have been able to succeed</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="4.949">this was an overthrow of government this</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="5.909">was an attempted overthrow and a lot of</text>
  <text start="381.529" dur="5.7">people were in on it and they got caught</text>
  <text start="384.739" dur="4.2">they got caught red-handed I look</text>
  <text start="387.229" dur="4.7">forward to the Durham report which is</text>
  <text start="388.939" dur="5.79">coming out in the not-too-distant future</text>
  <text start="391.929" dur="7.181">it&amp;#39;s got his own information which is</text>
  <text start="394.729" dur="6.21">this information plus plus plus and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="3.149">an incredible thing that happened and</text>
