  <text start="32" dur="4.17">emos of the nemo&amp;#39;s news network and</text>
  <text start="34.1" dur="5.19">there are some interesting points in the</text>
  <text start="36.17" dur="5.01">news that we should probably discuss if</text>
  <text start="39.29" dur="4.14">you guys just saw that one I did kind of</text>
  <text start="41.18" dur="4.71">specifically about the Ted Cruz tweet it</text>
  <text start="43.43" dur="4.949">looks like the justice phases is going</text>
  <text start="45.89" dur="4.23">strong and beginning really uh you know</text>
  <text start="48.379" dur="2.971">in earnest I think right before midterms</text>
  <text start="50.12" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s gonna put them off-balance</text>
  <text start="51.35" dur="3.45">throughout the actual election season</text>
  <text start="53.48" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s gonna make them hysterical and go</text>
  <text start="54.8" dur="4.2">crazy but of course we won&amp;#39;t do any of</text>
  <text start="57.17" dur="4.44">the actual arresting we&amp;#39;ll just do some</text>
  <text start="59" dur="5.129">investigations probably until 2020 that</text>
  <text start="61.61" dur="5.1">way they can&amp;#39;t you know cry you know</text>
  <text start="64.129" dur="3.901">foul play they can&amp;#39;t cry oh you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="66.71" dur="3.35">cheating the election things like that</text>
  <text start="68.03" dur="4.8">which we know the Democrats want to do</text>
  <text start="70.06" dur="4.39">and they&amp;#39;re gonna go full peak insane</text>
  <text start="72.83" dur="4.2">trying to stay out of prison trying to</text>
  <text start="74.45" dur="4.919">stay out of you get Guantanamo Bay or</text>
  <text start="77.03" dur="5.88">death forth for treasonous actions</text>
  <text start="79.369" dur="6.42">obviously so kind of moving on we even</text>
  <text start="82.91" dur="5.97">have Rosenstein kind of coming out now</text>
  <text start="85.789" dur="5.281">or not now but it came out now that even</text>
  <text start="88.88" dur="4.23">before the day before he had even</text>
  <text start="91.07" dur="4.02">retained Mueller or brought Mueller in</text>
  <text start="93.11" dur="4.31">for their special counsel he had been</text>
  <text start="95.09" dur="4.68">quoted as saying quote I am with Mueller</text>
  <text start="97.42" dur="5.5">newly-released Rosenstein emails reveal</text>
  <text start="99.77" dur="4.8">crusade to investigate Trump this is the</text>
  <text start="102.92" dur="3.75">the conversation I guess where he said</text>
  <text start="104.57" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t the boss and his staff do not know</text>
  <text start="106.67" dur="5.19">about our discussions and you know so</text>
  <text start="109.25" dur="4.02">this is from 145 pages of documents</text>
  <text start="111.86" dur="3.36">obtained by of course Judicial Watch</text>
  <text start="113.27" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re out there doing a lot of the the</text>
  <text start="115.22" dur="4.68">FOIA is and such Rosenstein a Mueller</text>
  <text start="118.1" dur="3.39">were discussing just three days after</text>
  <text start="119.9" dur="4.289">President Trump fired former FBI</text>
  <text start="121.49" dur="4.44">director James Comey and ostensibly for</text>
  <text start="124.189" dur="3.99">some time before that said we we already</text>
  <text start="125.93" dur="3.779">kind of expected this but it&amp;#39;s just more</text>
  <text start="128.179" dur="4.891">evidence that Rosenstein was indeed</text>
  <text start="129.709" dur="5.161">dirty and not that there was any shock</text>
  <text start="133.07" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;re surprised they finally called him</text>
  <text start="134.87" dur="4.35">they finally pushed him out right he was</text>
  <text start="136.82" dur="4.74">forced but and he even kind of went</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="3.84">along with bar but you could tell who</text>
  <text start="141.56" dur="4.35">had the real power in the room obviously</text>
  <text start="143.06" dur="4.5">President Trump had the real power and</text>
  <text start="145.91" dur="3.57">these guys are starting to really buckle</text>
  <text start="147.56" dur="3.89">and they&amp;#39;re starting to see cracks in</text>
  <text start="149.48" dur="3.44">their whole line their facade and</text>
  <text start="151.45" dur="4.08">starting to turn on each other these</text>
  <text start="152.92" dur="4.23">rats so it really is at that point now</text>
  <text start="155.53" dur="3.569">where the whole damn thing comes down</text>
  <text start="157.15" dur="3.479">the whole illusion comes down no one</text>
  <text start="159.099" dur="3.931">believes any of the lies that are</text>
  <text start="160.629" dur="4.47">telling instead of just a few of the</text>
  <text start="163.03" dur="4.89">lives that they&amp;#39;re telling now so trump</text>
  <text start="165.099" dur="6.72">amps up complaints and also says pelosi</text>
  <text start="167.92" dur="5.789">may be guilty of treason I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll let</text>
  <text start="171.819" dur="4.981">you see the actual quote for yourself</text>
  <text start="173.709" dur="5.521">here Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the</text>
  <text start="176.8" dur="4.68">mini shifty Adam Schiff lies in massive</text>
  <text start="179.23" dur="5.88">frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="6.42">American people Trump said on Twitter he</text>
  <text start="185.11" dur="5.129">also continued on to say this makes</text>
  <text start="187.9" dur="4.86">Nancy nervous Nancy every bit as guilty</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="4.741">as little we know what little means only</text>
  <text start="192.76" dur="4.77">Adam Schiff standard hotel and all the</text>
  <text start="194.98" dur="6.3">children so little Adam Schiff for high</text>
  <text start="197.53" dur="6.84">crimes and misdemeanors even treason Wow</text>
  <text start="201.28" dur="4.799">so Trump says this makes nervous Nancy</text>
  <text start="204.37" dur="4.01">every bit as guilty as little Adam</text>
  <text start="206.079" dur="6.121">Schiff for high crimes and misdemeanors</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="6.13">even treason I guess that means that</text>
  <text start="212.2" dur="4.53">they along with all those that evilly</text>
  <text start="214.51" dur="5.009">colluded with them must all be</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="5.099">immediately impeached or thrown in</text>
  <text start="219.519" dur="4.711">prison I would add we also have another</text>
  <text start="221.829" dur="4.861">huge update Pelosi and chef also</text>
  <text start="224.23" dur="5.7">apparently updated the house impeachment</text>
  <text start="226.69" dur="4.59">process on August 12 2019 the same day</text>
  <text start="229.93" dur="3.059">as the whistleblower complaint was</text>
  <text start="231.28" dur="3.48">received so they&amp;#39;re actually changing</text>
  <text start="232.989" dur="4.131">the rules now to try to stop Trump</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re gonna take away all of the</text>
  <text start="237.12" dur="4.119">counterbalances to an unlawful or unfair</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="4.95">impeachment so that they can actually</text>
  <text start="241.239" dur="4.47">force one through again it won&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="244.6" dur="3.359">they don&amp;#39;t have the power they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="245.709" dur="5.221">have the numbers but they are trying now</text>
  <text start="247.959" dur="5.041">also we have the Intel community</text>
  <text start="250.93" dur="4.889">inspector general Stonewall in Congress</text>
  <text start="253" dur="4.349">refusing to explain why he backdated</text>
  <text start="255.819" dur="5.01">secret changes to the whistleblower</text>
  <text start="257.349" dur="5.79">forum of course we know cuz he&amp;#39;s in with</text>
  <text start="260.829" dur="3.721">the bad team and this is just making it</text>
  <text start="263.139" dur="3.331">obvious for everyone who can read</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="4.83">between the lines so you know you could</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="3.27">hide guy but people know whose side</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="2.94">you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="269.74" dur="5.1">crazy as hell is Warren lied about being</text>
  <text start="272.32" dur="4.74">fired for being pregnant and now there</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="4.049">are records to prove it so not only has</text>
  <text start="277.06" dur="4.89">Pocahontas lied about her Cherokee</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="5.371">ancestry which is funny because I might</text>
  <text start="281.95" dur="2.64">have a little Cherokee ancestry on my</text>
  <text start="284.26" dur="2.61">mom</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="3.84">I don&amp;#39;t know I think it was Blackfoot</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="3.78">Indians or something she says I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="288.43" dur="4.35">even know if that&amp;#39;s true obviously I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="290.65" dur="3.33">got like a little bit of Irish or</text>
  <text start="292.78" dur="3.39">something because you can see the red</text>
  <text start="293.98" dur="5.19">hair kind of mixed in with the brown and</text>
  <text start="296.17" dur="6.93">the white when he gets long so you know</text>
  <text start="299.17" dur="6.09">she&amp;#39;s a liar and frankly this kind of</text>
  <text start="303.1" dur="6.42">person strikes me as a as a legitimate</text>
  <text start="305.26" dur="7.44">authentic psychopath because the types</text>
  <text start="309.52" dur="5.25">of lies that she is doing are or sort of</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="4.41">manipulative and exploitative but she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="4.05">good at them she&amp;#39;s a good liar she&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="317.11" dur="3.45">the kind of person that easily loses</text>
  <text start="318.82" dur="3.72">control of her emotions so I really</text>
  <text start="320.56" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t see sociopaths you know and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="322.54" dur="3.54">obviously not a trained psychologist or</text>
  <text start="324.67" dur="4.68">anything like that this is just my</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="5.94">personal opinion but in terms of you</text>
  <text start="329.35" dur="4.86">know a mental stability she seems like a</text>
  <text start="332.02" dur="5.16">stable human being so the lies are</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="4.95">malicious not you know just like a</text>
  <text start="337.18" dur="3.36">sociopath you can kind of tell that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="339.16" dur="2.79">kind of like you&amp;#39;re drug addict or</text>
  <text start="340.54" dur="2.88">something that maybe doesn&amp;#39;t really care</text>
  <text start="341.95" dur="4.32">about other people it&amp;#39;s kind of selfish</text>
  <text start="343.42" dur="4.17">but is obvious about it and people just</text>
  <text start="346.27" dur="3.06">kind of avoid them but because they</text>
  <text start="347.59" dur="3.09">maybe they do care but just less than</text>
  <text start="349.33" dur="3.87">most people and maybe they&amp;#39;re just like</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="4.41">a selfish narcissist or something but a</text>
  <text start="353.2" dur="3.93">full psychopath will sit there and lie</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="4.92">to your lie to your face looking you</text>
  <text start="357.13" dur="5.58">right in the eye and and and thank</text>
  <text start="360.01" dur="4.41">mentally the whole time that you&amp;#39;re prey</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="4.08">and they are the predator for them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="364.42" dur="3.63">like that it and and ethics work a</text>
  <text start="366.79" dur="2.97">little bit differently it&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="3.72">ethics of the law of the jungle so to</text>
  <text start="369.76" dur="3.78">speak I mean it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="371.77" dur="4.05">a good person they&amp;#39;ll still crush you</text>
  <text start="373.54" dur="5.4">unless you&amp;#39;ve got teeth so it&amp;#39;s a power</text>
  <text start="375.82" dur="5.79">dynamic it&amp;#39;s not a morality dynamic the</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="4.8">problem is that Psychopaths living</text>
  <text start="381.61" dur="3.99">within a morality dynamic like we have</text>
  <text start="383.74" dur="3.66">in this world I mean so fairly on its</text>
  <text start="385.6" dur="5.19">face a moral word world where people</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="5.04">obviously look down on evil actions like</text>
  <text start="390.79" dur="3.06">murder rape things like that for the</text>
  <text start="392.44" dur="3.36">most part we live in the illusion that</text>
  <text start="393.85" dur="4.29">we&amp;#39;re living in a good world but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.8" dur="4.35">not and Psychopaths take massive</text>
  <text start="398.14" dur="4.65">advantage of people who live in that</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="4.95">delusion because no one sees them coming</text>
  <text start="402.79" dur="4.26">these are the people that that get into</text>
  <text start="405.1" dur="4.68">the top you know one or four percent or</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="4.53">whatever of politics or other groups of</text>
  <text start="409.78" dur="3.46">power because they like power so much</text>
  <text start="411.58" dur="4.17">psychopaths are drawn</text>
  <text start="413.24" dur="5.34">power more than anything else out there</text>
  <text start="415.75" dur="3.699">and you know I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="418.58" dur="3.57">Psychopaths</text>
  <text start="419.449" dur="4.231">a little bit in this Channel&amp;#39;s history a</text>
  <text start="422.15" dur="3.989">lot of the people that we see up there I</text>
  <text start="423.68" dur="4.65">think are likely Psychopaths like the</text>
  <text start="426.139" dur="4.171">Pelosi&amp;#39;s and Adam shifts and such and</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="4.589">these are people that have no remorse no</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="6.329">empathy no sympathy for what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="5.011">done or their victims in fact and I</text>
  <text start="436.639" dur="2.911">don&amp;#39;t understand them completely because</text>
  <text start="437.93" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;m not a psychopath but the best I can</text>
  <text start="439.55" dur="4.32">get it is that they actually think that</text>
  <text start="441.68" dur="5.04">people that they hurt deserve to be hurt</text>
  <text start="443.87" dur="5.609">for being so weak so you know it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="446.72" dur="5.52">complete opposite of a normal good</text>
  <text start="449.479" dur="4.231">functioning human being where you you</text>
  <text start="452.24" dur="2.489">have some empathy for others you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="2.73">want to hurt people unless it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.729" dur="3.391">necessary like you could maybe defend</text>
  <text start="456.44" dur="4.59">yourself but you don&amp;#39;t take pleasure</text>
  <text start="458.12" dur="3.69">from it Psychopaths take pleasure from</text>
  <text start="461.03" dur="2.789">hurting people</text>
  <text start="461.81" dur="4.46">good people especially but especially</text>
  <text start="463.819" dur="4.711">good weak people who won&amp;#39;t fight back</text>
  <text start="466.27" dur="4.149">psychopaths love that stuff that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="468.53" dur="4.53">they like power over people because</text>
  <text start="470.419" dur="4.711">power lets them hurt people it lets them</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="4.26">have their you know not not to mention</text>
  <text start="475.13" dur="3.659">the resource you know aspect of it if</text>
  <text start="477.32" dur="3.27">you have power you get more resources</text>
  <text start="478.789" dur="4.651">and things like that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s human</text>
  <text start="480.59" dur="5.609">biology but I didn&amp;#39;t want to go too far</text>
  <text start="483.44" dur="5.279">into this but to understand why Liz</text>
  <text start="486.199" dur="4.231">Warren lies so often and so well and has</text>
  <text start="488.719" dur="2.88">gotten so many advantages from it</text>
  <text start="490.43" dur="3.18">obviously she&amp;#39;s a powerful politician</text>
  <text start="491.599" dur="4.401">running for president now after a</text>
  <text start="493.61" dur="4.049">history of lying to people for gain</text>
  <text start="496" dur="3.34">because it works</text>
  <text start="497.659" dur="3.57">this kind of stuff works and it only</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="4.56">works because people&amp;#39;s eyes are close to</text>
  <text start="501.229" dur="6.631">it they live in this happy asleep world</text>
  <text start="503.9" dur="5.79">of innocent and happy people going about</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="3.869">their lives and they don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="509.69" dur="4.62">that all those stories about monsters</text>
  <text start="511.729" dur="3.661">that we grew up with were real they just</text>
  <text start="514.31" dur="3.12">weren&amp;#39;t real monsters they were</text>
  <text start="515.39" dur="3.689">metaphors for psychopathic people that</text>
  <text start="517.43" dur="3.12">hurt other people that&amp;#39;s what all these</text>
  <text start="519.079" dur="3.661">like good and evil stories are about</text>
  <text start="520.55" dur="4.349">Lord of the Rings was about communism</text>
  <text start="522.74" dur="4.05">for example and and state power I mean</text>
  <text start="524.899" dur="4.051">that that ring from Lord of the Rings</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="4.14">was government power everyone hopes that</text>
  <text start="528.95" dur="3.81">they can use it for the best for the</text>
  <text start="530.93" dur="3.149">whole world or maybe to help others or</text>
  <text start="532.76" dur="3.36">maybe they just want to get power over</text>
  <text start="534.079" dur="4.471">others but eventually you got to destroy</text>
  <text start="536.12" dur="4.29">that stuff because any power corrupts</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="4.409">and absolute power corrupts absolutely</text>
  <text start="540.41" dur="3.929">so you know if Gandalf had got in the</text>
  <text start="542.959" dur="2.041">ring in Lord of the Rings he would have</text>
  <text start="544.339" dur="2.221">become the</text>
  <text start="545" dur="3.569">sauron eventually he would have become</text>
  <text start="546.56" dur="4.139">the tyrant eventually even though he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.569" dur="4.861">this sweet hearted wise old man who knew</text>
