  <text start="3.389" dur="5.731">fourth back outs of the debate just this</text>
  <text start="6.029" dur="4.771">week so obviously I&amp;#39;ve issued some</text>
  <text start="9.12" dur="3.66">debate challenges I want to I want to</text>
  <text start="10.8" dur="6.03">clear up some of the confusion out there</text>
  <text start="12.78" dur="7.53">and I want to like I said clear the path</text>
  <text start="16.83" dur="5.13">of truth you know kind of an easy way</text>
  <text start="20.31" dur="4.86">through the weeds for newcomers to the Q</text>
  <text start="21.96" dur="5.46">movement and of course I issued a</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="4.47">challenge to unis wrong and I issued a</text>
  <text start="27.42" dur="3.57">challenge to Isaac green it was actually</text>
  <text start="29.64" dur="3.24">a combination I wasn&amp;#39;t really interested</text>
  <text start="30.99" dur="3.93">in uni but Isaac you know he has a</text>
  <text start="32.88" dur="4.47">larger audience and and people actually</text>
  <text start="34.92" dur="7.26">respect him as a cue figure previously</text>
  <text start="37.35" dur="6.18">so you know Isaac back down I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="2.789">it said that he did not back out but</text>
  <text start="43.53" dur="4.97">it&amp;#39;s on his own Twitter he backed out he</text>
  <text start="44.969" dur="6.18">actually made two separate messages</text>
  <text start="48.5" dur="5.05">basically the first one was on good bra</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="4.651">or something like that in the second one</text>
  <text start="53.55" dur="3.84">was it&amp;#39;s a waste of time ironic because</text>
  <text start="55.8" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s the same thing Lee said waste of</text>
  <text start="57.39" dur="5.13">time waste of his time I guess when he</text>
  <text start="59.91" dur="5.01">could not address my arguments but the</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="5.279">the first person to back out would be a</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="4.019">uni rock himself because what has</text>
  <text start="67.799" dur="3">happened and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="68.939" dur="3.841">complicated and it&amp;#39;s a little it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="70.799" dur="2.281">very it leaves you with a bad taste in</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="3.54">your mouth</text>
  <text start="73.08" dur="4.38">frankly it&amp;#39;s some low IQ drama stuff and</text>
  <text start="76.32" dur="3.75">I don&amp;#39;t usually mess with that kind of</text>
  <text start="77.46" dur="4.08">thing but there&amp;#39;s a big fuss and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="80.07" dur="3.72">blowing up my Twitter and I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="3.869">people to be led astray I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="83.79" dur="3.63">what these people do for for a</text>
  <text start="85.409" dur="4.32">profession I guess is play video games</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="4.949">and lead people astray so I want to</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="6.801">address exactly what happened and what</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="9.271">went down so after my challenge</text>
  <text start="96.53" dur="9.22">basically they apparently accepted right</text>
  <text start="101.64" dur="6.299">and I was on the road when this this</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="4.32">went down I was after my challenge I got</text>
  <text start="107.939" dur="3.841">ready to go on vacation for the 4th to</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="3.75">see my family including my two</text>
  <text start="111.78" dur="4.65">grandmothers who are one was in the</text>
  <text start="113.82" dur="3.96">hospital she&amp;#39;s out now thankfully but</text>
  <text start="116.43" dur="2.88">neither of them are doing very well to</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="4.589">both old and this may be my last chance</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="7.379">to see them so I&amp;#39;m on the way to North</text>
  <text start="122.369" dur="5.941">Carolina it&amp;#39;s a 24 hour ish drive with</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="3.871">baby and dogs and everything else in a</text>
  <text start="128.31" dur="4.82">short three hour now and then halfway</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="5.06">through I find on Twitter that there is</text>
  <text start="133.13" dur="5.01">apparently a debate and I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="135.62" dur="4.56">about it and they are already declaring</text>
  <text start="138.14" dur="4.35">victory so if my first thought was like</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="4.23">what well that okay maybe they just</text>
  <text start="142.49" dur="3.12">misunderstood me okay I didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="144.41" dur="3.69">anything about now</text>
  <text start="145.61" dur="3.6">so I elaborated like we need to</text>
  <text start="148.1" dur="2.19">obviously we need to pick out a</text>
  <text start="149.21" dur="2.73">moderator that I mean the debate</text>
  <text start="150.29" dur="3.21">requires a moderator especially when</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="5.85">people disagree especially when there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="6.3">BS drama and games like that I was</text>
  <text start="157.79" dur="3.33">actually just banned from the chat so</text>
  <text start="159.8" dur="4.38">you won&amp;#39;t even get to see all of the</text>
  <text start="161.12" dur="6.42">beautiful text from the unique rocks</text>
  <text start="164.18" dur="8.25">chat anyway he&amp;#39;ll he&amp;#39;ll ban me here in a</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="6.12">moment too and that&amp;#39;s fine I this is</text>
  <text start="172.43" dur="2.34">exactly what you would expect to happen</text>
  <text start="173.66" dur="4.47">he blocked me on Twitter we&amp;#39;ll get to</text>
  <text start="174.77" dur="6.87">that so where was I I was on the way</text>
  <text start="178.13" dur="7.65">home well in my original home I guess I</text>
  <text start="181.64" dur="5.49">still call it home and after this I I</text>
  <text start="185.78" dur="2.91">found out that they were doing this</text>
  <text start="187.13" dur="2.97">debate anti school and uni Rock were</text>
  <text start="188.69" dur="2.91">they are apparently in dis corridor in</text>
  <text start="190.1" dur="4.52">livestream or something and supposedly</text>
  <text start="191.6" dur="5.46">waiting on me though I had no idea and</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="4.72">they may have sent me a message I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="197.06" dur="5.79">get any DM so I don&amp;#39;t know if they sent</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="4.71">me a message but you know I&amp;#39;ll give them</text>
  <text start="202.85" dur="2.31">the benefit that at this point maybe</text>
  <text start="204.05" dur="2.73">they just got a little heat you know</text>
  <text start="205.16" dur="3.3">ahead of themselves maybe they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="3.57">know what debating is so you know I have</text>
  <text start="208.46" dur="4.65">to explain the debates require a</text>
  <text start="210.35" dur="4.53">moderator someone to keep the pace keep</text>
  <text start="213.11" dur="3.39">the time and keep it neutral if you</text>
  <text start="214.88" dur="3.36">understand if you don&amp;#39;t understand that</text>
  <text start="216.5" dur="5.04">then just watch my recent debate with</text>
  <text start="218.24" dur="4.77">Lee I should have took a moderator in he</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="2.61">was polite and he was respectful at</text>
  <text start="223.01" dur="2.64">first and I didn&amp;#39;t think that it was</text>
  <text start="224.15" dur="3.48">necessary and that was my mistake and I</text>
  <text start="225.65" dur="5.4">apologize because it turned into a kind</text>
  <text start="227.63" dur="5.1">of a crapshoot a lot of logical</text>
  <text start="231.05" dur="4.83">fallacies and then and talking over me</text>
  <text start="232.73" dur="6.24">and stuff of that nature but getting</text>
  <text start="235.88" dur="4.38">back to the point after this you know I</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="3">kind of call them out and I was like</text>
  <text start="240.26" dur="3.3">look we need to set a time obviously I</text>
  <text start="241.97" dur="3.48">need to prepare this is a huge thing to</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="4.23">deal with this is like 1600 plus post</text>
  <text start="245.45" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s like trying to debate the entire</text>

  <text start="250.13" dur="3.12">happened those particular days of</text>
  <text start="251.78" dur="4.02">history in the Bible I mean it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="253.25" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s not fair to ask someone to not be</text>
  <text start="255.8" dur="3.45">prepared for this of course you would do</text>
  <text start="257.6" dur="3.81">that if you are afraid of them actually</text>
  <text start="259.25" dur="4.65">being prepared and and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.41" dur="3.94">that kind of stuff I heard many I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="263.9" dur="2.89">see this I can&amp;#39;t prove it I</text>
  <text start="265.35" dur="4.14">many reports saying that he was a</text>
  <text start="266.79" dur="4.44">visibly shaken when he did when he he</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="4.56">actually heard that I wanted a moderator</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="4.44">and time to prepare my notes if that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="309.84" dur="8.91">point you Isaac backed out uni continued</text>
  <text start="315.45" dur="5.19">to do these daily fake debates it hoaxes</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="3.45">debates where he says you know he he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="320.64" dur="3.36">have his people come to my Twitter and</text>
  <text start="322.2" dur="3.03">blow me up and and I&amp;#39;ve got some of</text>
  <text start="324" dur="4.14">those guys on there for eight hours a</text>

  <text start="329.31" dur="4.29">actually kind of enjoy that part because</text>
  <text start="330.78" dur="5.73">it really it proves my point for me you</text>
  <text start="333.6" dur="4.68">know I don&amp;#39;t actually have to - there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.51" dur="3.3">no doubt about it for people who read</text>
  <text start="338.28" dur="4.86">these these comments and see how they</text>
  <text start="339.81" dur="5.18">behave toward me it&amp;#39;s the same kind of</text>
  <text start="343.14" dur="4.8">behavior you&amp;#39;re gonna get from uni rock</text>
  <text start="344.99" dur="4.48">so at this point I feel like maybe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="3.72">got some emotional instability so I</text>
  <text start="349.47" dur="3.84">really want that moderator and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="351.66" dur="4.02">definitely willing to debate but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="353.31" dur="4.59">like all this dishonesty and sleaziness</text>
  <text start="355.68" dur="7.2">has left me with a very bad taste in my</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="7.2">mouth so at this point i proposed jordan</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.2">saylor as a moderator because i trust</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="5.04">him to be fair and neutral and let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="5.04">honest a moderator who has any</text>
  <text start="370.14" dur="3.51">intellectual ability i won&amp;#39;t even say</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="3.57">they don&amp;#39;t have to be smart they just</text>
  <text start="373.65" dur="4.98">have to be honest okay because really</text>
  <text start="375.69" dur="4.44">their job is to like keep the time like</text>
  <text start="378.63" dur="3.29">you have this many minutes to talk and</text>
  <text start="380.13" dur="3.96">this many seconds or minutes to rebut</text>
  <text start="381.92" dur="3.82">keep the crosstalk down you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="384.09" dur="2.85">allowed to speak it&amp;#39;s their turn just</text>
  <text start="385.74" dur="4.23">like with the presidential debates</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="5.37">except for you didn&amp;#39;t see the</text>
  <text start="389.97" dur="3.78">presidential debates well some maybe</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="2.669">sometimes it got immature but you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="393.75" dur="2.76">see them basically getting out there and</text>
  <text start="394.979" dur="3.091">insulting each other making fun of each</text>

  <text start="414.449" dur="5.731">he does a fake debate where I I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="418.589" dur="2.97">aware that it was going on I mean at</text>
  <text start="420.18" dur="3.959">this point I&amp;#39;m aware he&amp;#39;s doing these</text>
  <text start="421.559" dur="4.11">fake debates so I I mean I assume that I</text>
  <text start="424.139" dur="2.941">could go to his channel and chat with</text>
  <text start="425.669" dur="3.541">him but that I didn&amp;#39;t challenge him to a</text>
  <text start="427.08" dur="4.169">chat I challenged him to a debate he</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="4.41">keeps trying to like get away from the</text>
  <text start="431.249" dur="3.931">moderator thing and that&amp;#39;s the one thing</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="4.169">that all of his people are attacking me</text>

  <text start="753.49" dur="4.95">waiting to hear back if he wants to</text>
  <text start="754.99" dur="5.76">accept Titus frost as a moderator or</text>
  <text start="758.44" dur="6.09">propose a neutral third party moderator</text>
  <text start="760.75" dur="7.32">that I trust to keep the peace then we</text>
  <text start="764.53" dur="5.58">will set up a a date that works for</text>
  <text start="768.07" dur="3.84">myself who is very busy and does not</text>
  <text start="770.11" dur="3.45">play video games for a living</text>
  <text start="771.91" dur="4.17">for the moderator whoever that may be</text>
  <text start="773.56" dur="4.86">who I&amp;#39;m assuming is a very busy person</text>
  <text start="776.08" dur="6.09">as well and has a life in the job and a</text>
  <text start="778.42" dur="5.76">responsibility and uni rock who spends</text>
  <text start="782.17" dur="4.32">his days streaming and playing video</text>
  <text start="784.18" dur="5.91">games and lying to people and about</text>
  <text start="786.49" dur="5.07">people now those three three schedules</text>
  <text start="790.09" dur="4.2">would obviously have to match up for a</text>
  <text start="791.56" dur="4.07">debate for in the case of anti school so</text>
  <text start="794.29" dur="3.6">they really tried to jump the gun there</text>
  <text start="795.63" dur="4.77">if you&amp;#39;ve ever tried to match up for</text>
  <text start="797.89" dur="5.46">busy schedules I don&amp;#39;t know if he has</text>
  <text start="800.4" dur="5.35">and that&amp;#39;s where we are now so he has</text>
  <text start="803.35" dur="4.56">refused my suggestions he&amp;#39;s refused</text>
  <text start="805.75" dur="4.41">proposals for moderators he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="807.91" dur="4.32">afraid to have a moderator and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="810.16" dur="3.9">one particular reason that one person</text>
  <text start="812.23" dur="4.38">would be afraid to have a moderator and</text>
  <text start="814.06" dur="5.55">that is he knows that his only arguments</text>
  <text start="816.61" dur="5.52">are deceptive and that if I were to call</text>
  <text start="819.61" dur="4.23">them out and a moderator was to say hmm</text>
  <text start="822.13" dur="3.66">yeah that makes sense uni rock that</text>
  <text start="823.84" dur="6.06">doesn&amp;#39;t that doesn&amp;#39;t fly that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="825.79" dur="6.3">stand the test of scrutiny then uni rock</text>
  <text start="829.9" dur="5.76">would basically be demolished and his</text>
  <text start="832.09" dur="5.94">entire his entire audience would see him</text>
  <text start="835.66" dur="4.71">for what he is and in fact that would</text>
  <text start="838.03" dur="3.96">stand as the record forever right</text>
  <text start="840.37" dur="3.59">because I&amp;#39;m never gonna let that video</text>
  <text start="841.99" dur="4.85">get deleted from the internet for sure</text>
  <text start="843.96" dur="5.68">and this brings me to the last point</text>
  <text start="846.84" dur="4.09">they wanted to rush me into this sort</text>
  <text start="849.64" dur="2.4">last two points they wanted to rush me</text>
  <text start="850.93" dur="2.58">into this and they&amp;#39;re like in the end</text>
  <text start="852.04" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;ve even heard that I was quoted as</text>
  <text start="853.51" dur="3.33">having said let&amp;#39;s debate now I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="855.64" dur="3.84">say that</text>
  <text start="856.84" dur="4.89">in fact I have the screenshot of what I</text>
  <text start="859.48" dur="4.68">actually said which is from what his</text>
  <text start="861.73" dur="4.49">video was saying about me where he took</text>
  <text start="864.16" dur="5.34">the screenshot of what I actually said</text>
  <text start="866.22" dur="5.65">and it says here happy to debate both</text>
  <text start="869.5" dur="5.25">anti school and uni wrong no scripts no</text>
  <text start="871.87" dur="4.8">editing I published the 100% unedited</text>
  <text start="874.75" dur="4.8">recording after now this is very</text>
  <text start="876.67" dur="5.1">specific a debate requires a moderator</text>
  <text start="879.55" dur="3.75">ok so there&amp;#39;s none of this gotcha stuff</text>
  <text start="881.77" dur="3.75">with the you didn&amp;#39;t show up to my</text>
  <text start="883.3" dur="3.36">discord livestream chat tonight that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="885.52" dur="2.49">not a moderator and it&amp;#39;s not a debate</text>
  <text start="886.66" dur="2.58">that&amp;#39;s a chat that&amp;#39;s a discussion I</text>
  <text start="888.01" dur="2.46">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t discuss things with</text>
  <text start="889.24" dur="3.51">disgusting human beings</text>
  <text start="890.47" dur="3.42">I don&amp;#39;t chat with liars I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="892.75" dur="3.87">associate with this kind of people</text>
  <text start="893.89" dur="4.73">generally speaking because I have</text>
  <text start="896.62" dur="7.66">integrity and morals obviously</text>
  <text start="898.62" dur="5.66">but they&amp;#39;re also trying this</text>
  <text start="904.43" dur="7.06">they&amp;#39;re trying this you won&amp;#39;t show up to</text>
  <text start="909.87" dur="3.48">a live stream right like you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="911.49" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re afraid of a live stream and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="913.35" dur="4.41">not that it&amp;#39;s that I&amp;#39;m a technical idiot</text>
  <text start="915.6" dur="4.95">and I don&amp;#39;t know how to both record and</text>
  <text start="917.76" dur="5.01">live straight now to be fair when I did</text>
  <text start="920.55" dur="5.01">my thing with Lee his son was able to</text>
  <text start="922.77" dur="5.01">figure out how to do a live stream from</text>
  <text start="925.56" dur="4.17">his end and you&amp;#39;ll notice the live</text>
  <text start="927.78" dur="3.72">stream on periscope actually had his</text>
  <text start="929.73" dur="3.81">intro and all that other stuff so you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="931.5" dur="4.17">see on my youtube it&amp;#39;s all his intro and</text>
  <text start="933.54" dur="6.06">stuff and I just recorded the periscope</text>
  <text start="935.67" dur="5.49">because I forgot to record on Zoom I</text>
  <text start="939.6" dur="4.11">forgot hit the button and I was able to</text>
  <text start="941.16" dur="6.99">snag the video quickly with a download</text>
  <text start="943.71" dur="7.26">option but basically I don&amp;#39;t trust uni</text>
  <text start="948.15" dur="7.01">Rock to debate me fairly lose the debate</text>
  <text start="950.97" dur="6.54">and then keep the video up as a fair</text>
  <text start="955.16" dur="4.45">testament to what happened so I need a</text>
  <text start="957.51" dur="3.9">recording and I need the full unedited</text>
  <text start="959.61" dur="3.33">recording in full context which is my</text>
  <text start="961.41" dur="2.91">way of doing things I liked I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="962.94" dur="3.81">to take people out of context</text>
  <text start="964.32" dur="4.8">I don&amp;#39;t put 18 second clips of people</text>
  <text start="966.75" dur="4.14">out there from the four hour for five</text>
  <text start="969.12" dur="4.02">hour debate videos like uni rock has</text>
  <text start="970.89" dur="5.01">done to me on well his his viewers to be</text>
  <text start="973.14" dur="5.64">fair but we know what&amp;#39;s behind that so</text>
  <text start="975.9" dur="4.65">this is the kind of you know not even</text>
  <text start="978.78" dur="4.38">just with uni wrong folks this is this</text>
  <text start="980.55" dur="5.7">is not a one-person thing and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="983.16" dur="4.83">even really I don&amp;#39;t really I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="986.25" dur="3.66">to get personally involved in this I</text>
  <text start="987.99" dur="4.38">mean it&amp;#39;s this is just sophistry this is</text>
  <text start="989.91" dur="4.8">a great actually this is a wonderful</text>
  <text start="992.37" dur="4.68">lesson of sophistry so this is the kind</text>
  <text start="994.71" dur="3.75">of stuff the left does a lot this is the</text>
  <text start="997.05" dur="3.39">kind of stuff like the Communists and</text>
  <text start="998.46" dur="6.27">such do this is the logical fallacy</text>
  <text start="1000.44" dur="9.27">confuse manipulate Gaslight and and can</text>
  <text start="1004.73" dur="7.08">just create fog around the situation so</text>
  <text start="1009.71" dur="3.96">to that end you know I had to get this</text>
  <text start="1011.81" dur="3.8">clarification out there and this it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1013.67" dur="4.38">great case study if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1015.61" dur="4.15">curious about the kind of tactics that</text>
  <text start="1018.05" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re going to come up against with the</text>
  <text start="1019.76" dur="3.12">left yeah they would absolutely do</text>
  <text start="1021.38" dur="2.82">things like this and lie about you just</text>
  <text start="1022.88" dur="3.659">look at what they&amp;#39;re doing look at the</text>
  <text start="1024.2" dur="4.589">the cases that came out today</text>
  <text start="1026.539" dur="5.221">we have multiple outlets that were</text>

  <text start="1059.87" dur="7.439">really embarrassing for them and the</text>
  <text start="1064.159" dur="5.431">other was one where they had actually</text>
  <text start="1067.309" dur="5.401">published the article and they used the</text>
  <text start="1069.59" dur="5.79">term controversy I think was</text>
  <text start="1072.71" dur="4.319">controversial court pick or something</text>
  <text start="1075.38" dur="4.35">like that but this was published before</text>
  <text start="1077.029" dur="4.051">he had actually announced his pick so it</text>
  <text start="1079.73" dur="2.76">was already controversial before he</text>
  <text start="1081.08" dur="3.75">announced the pic this is the kind of</text>
  <text start="1082.49" dur="4.529">things that we deal with so this is not</text>
  <text start="1084.83" dur="6.66">only a call out this is not only a set</text>
  <text start="1087.019" dur="7.5">the record straight this is a case study</text>
