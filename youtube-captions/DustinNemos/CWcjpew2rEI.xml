  <text start="7.83" dur="4.92">resignation anon now this is one of the</text>
  <text start="10.559" dur="3.66">folks behind helping us track all of the</text>
  <text start="12.75" dur="4.38">resignations that&amp;#39;s going on I mean we</text>
  <text start="14.219" dur="4.921">have over 4,100 resignations at this</text>
  <text start="17.13" dur="3.69">point and you know you combine that with</text>
  <text start="19.14" dur="3.84">those Silve indictments and the</text>
  <text start="20.82" dur="3.24">executive order and and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="22.98" dur="2.76">buzz going around there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="24.06" dur="3.959">excitement this is one of the the key</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="3.689">factors that make people hopeful and</text>
  <text start="28.019" dur="3">believe in the queue movement as</text>
  <text start="29.429" dur="3.871">something that&amp;#39;s going to affect real</text>
  <text start="31.019" dur="4.411">change in the world so you know with</text>
  <text start="33.3" dur="4.47">that said resignation would you uh would</text>
  <text start="35.43" dur="4.26">you like to take over and kind of give</text>
  <text start="37.77" dur="3.27">us you know where we are give us a recap</text>
  <text start="39.69" dur="10.49">of what we&amp;#39;ve been through with the</text>
  <text start="41.04" dur="12.659">resignations and then what&amp;#39;s new since</text>
  <text start="50.18" dur="10.109">you started posting I think he started</text>
  <text start="53.699" dur="10.86">in end of October last year and on</text>
  <text start="60.289" dur="7.631">December 21st I think he said Trek</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="8.971">resignations and yeah on this point we</text>
  <text start="67.92" dur="8.879">had some postings on 4chan it was</text>
  <text start="73.53" dur="5.28">growing over some days and yeah I asked</text>
  <text start="76.799" dur="5.041">some announcer if it wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense</text>
  <text start="78.81" dur="7.169">to do this on on a different format</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="5.819">maybe on a spreadsheet we said hey if</text>
  <text start="85.979" dur="3.721">you want to do this because I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="87.659" dur="7.081">time and have fun and yeah this was the</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="8.55">point where I started and since this we</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="7.62">have nine months of gum and yeah we have</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="7.17">more than 4100 resignations from loving</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="6.39">130 countries countries all over the</text>
  <text start="105.42" dur="6.87">world and at the beginning I never</text>
  <text start="108.75" dur="7.049">thought that the numbers are increasing</text>
  <text start="112.29" dur="5.82">that much so I&amp;#39;m a little bit surprised</text>
  <text start="115.799" dur="9.03">I expected some hundreds but not many</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="8.64">thousands and so we have found a lot of</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="4.081">interesting connections but I think we</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="6.15">can talk about these connections a</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="4.89">little bit later okay these a quick</text>
  <text start="132.9" dur="3.15">question I have</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t know if you guys track what a</text>
  <text start="136.05" dur="7.02">normal year would look like for</text>
  <text start="138.15" dur="7.77">comparison I unfortunately don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="143.07" dur="5.64">clue but normal numbers are but if you</text>
  <text start="145.92" dur="4.95">look into a Google spreadsheet with all</text>
  <text start="148.71" dur="6.21">the resignations and you can find</text>
  <text start="150.87" dur="7.47">another tap it&amp;#39;s called etcetera it has</text>
  <text start="154.92" dur="5.67">been named links and they can find some</text>
  <text start="158.34" dur="4.86">articles so I&amp;#39;ve found in my research</text>
  <text start="160.59" dur="6.56">and some of these articles already says</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="11.13">but the number of resignations is on an</text>
  <text start="167.15" dur="9.28">eight-year high and if I look to June in</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="5.76">this year we had more than 600</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="6.72">resignations tracked I think the current</text>
  <text start="180.09" dur="6.66">number should be a little bit more high</text>
  <text start="183.15" dur="5.73">of an eight-year high so you know III</text>
  <text start="186.75" dur="3.87">know from just following politics a</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="3.54">little bit that the the political</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="2.97">resignations you know not even counting</text>
  <text start="192.42" dur="2.88">all the business stuff that the</text>
  <text start="193.59" dur="3.06">political resignations are huge I mean</text>
  <text start="195.3" dur="4.409">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of people in</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="5.58">positions of power stepping down many</text>
  <text start="199.709" dur="4.561">you know having sexual deviancy charges</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="3.45">or accusations and things like that but</text>
  <text start="204.27" dur="4.17">many of them just mysteriously</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="5.4">disappearing the what are your thoughts</text>
  <text start="208.44" dur="7.67">and what do you see coming down the</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="7.29">pipeline so I have different thoughts</text>
  <text start="216.11" dur="4.45">especially for different countries so</text>
  <text start="218.37" dur="5.91">under resignation list you can also find</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="5.94">that some governments you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.28" dur="6.81">dissolved completely for different</text>
  <text start="226.5" dur="7.92">reasons and yeah generally you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="5.88">a lot of politicians are leaving the</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="5.4">position actually for also different</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="6.39">reasons yeah most people are thinking</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="6.6">don&amp;#39;t call the exact reason and</text>
  <text start="243.36" dur="6.17">especially in the political sector in</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="6.15">the USA it&amp;#39;s how to tell if they</text>
  <text start="249.53" dur="5.67">resigned on their own or maybe they are</text>
  <text start="252.57" dur="7.139">forced or some of them they&amp;#39;re fired</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="6.789">similar thing you have in the in the</text>
  <text start="259.709" dur="7.381">police sector or secure a Secret Service</text>
  <text start="261.989" dur="5.671">or sector as well so I think they have</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="3.66">reasons</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="6.72">Labe don&amp;#39;t publish all of these</text>
  <text start="270.75" dur="5.16">informations do you think that there may</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="3.12">be something you know linked to the</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="3.45">executive order for human trafficking</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="3.63">corruption where you know Trump has</text>
  <text start="279.36" dur="4.38">basically said they can take assets for</text>
  <text start="281.13" dur="5.31">people involved in these things in some</text>
  <text start="283.74" dur="6.74">cases yes but I don&amp;#39;t think for the</text>
  <text start="286.44" dur="9.63">majority because this executive order is</text>
  <text start="290.48" dur="8.8">as far as I know only valid for American</text>
  <text start="296.07" dur="5.94">people and if you try to do something in</text>
  <text start="299.28" dur="4.95">Germany or in other European countries</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="4.95">I think this wouldn&amp;#39;t be possible at all</text>
  <text start="304.23" dur="4.11">I know that I had heard some people</text>
  <text start="306.96" dur="2.97">talking and I don&amp;#39;t know all the details</text>
  <text start="308.34" dur="3.78">I had heard some people talking about</text>
  <text start="309.93" dur="5.67">how this could be theoretically enforced</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="6.03">on you know international you know</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="4.56">people but you know we saw some some big</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="3.54">players step down like Eric Schmidt</text>
  <text start="320.16" dur="3.72">stepped down from Google basically the</text>
  <text start="321.69" dur="4.83">day after I mean we&amp;#39;ve seen some major</text>
  <text start="323.88" dur="4.74">players step down and even in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="326.52" dur="3.75">we&amp;#39;ve seen some big guys that would</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="4.07">otherwise probably not have stepped down</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="4.8">with with inexplicable no reasons I mean</text>
  <text start="332.69" dur="4.36">there&amp;#39;s there seems to be a lot of smoke</text>
  <text start="335.07" dur="7.59">around that and and I think that we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="7.5">see some fire soon but if you look into</text>
  <text start="342.66" dur="5.54">some special cases we have on the</text>
  <text start="344.55" dur="6.18">resignation list especially for big</text>
  <text start="348.2" dur="6.55">American Internet companies or Google</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="7.65">Twitter Facebook Amazon and so on in a</text>
  <text start="354.75" dur="6.93">short period so in some cases only in a</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="6.69">few days so people from all of these</text>
  <text start="361.68" dur="5.04">companies with the same job title so</text>
  <text start="365.07" dur="5.01">maybe something like a chief security</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="7.02">officer in this company they all left</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="7.589">and only a few days and this case we had</text>
  <text start="373.74" dur="6.74">to think two or three times so this is</text>
  <text start="377.669" dur="7.741">some I would say definitely related to</text>
  <text start="380.48" dur="8.05">the executive order you have much more</text>
  <text start="385.41" dur="7.44">people from different branches on the</text>
  <text start="388.53" dur="6.21">lists but yes some people that would</text>
  <text start="392.85" dur="3.12">otherwise probably be kind of in the</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="2.82">know you know they&amp;#39;re if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="395.97" dur="2.64">security experts they&amp;#39;re on the internet</text>
  <text start="397.56" dur="2.55">they&amp;#39;re tracking everything they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="398.61" dur="2.55">heard about queueing on probably they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="3.06">heard about</text>
  <text start="401.16" dur="6.18">executive order and all of that just</text>
  <text start="403.17" dur="6.72">kind of my thought but it&amp;#39;s hard to say</text>
  <text start="407.34" dur="6.71">what a chief security officer really</text>
  <text start="409.89" dur="8.4">does so yes his job title says he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="7.78">responsible for security but every</text>
  <text start="418.29" dur="6.87">company handles a job position different</text>
  <text start="421.83" dur="6.57">and that&amp;#39;s why you can&amp;#39;t say that if</text>
  <text start="425.16" dur="8.15">it&amp;#39;s in company a and Company B it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.4" dur="9.18">exactly the same so I think it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="433.31" dur="9.52">important to know what people are able</text>
  <text start="437.58" dur="7.86">to do and as far as I understand this</text>
  <text start="442.83" dur="5.52">most high-ranking people are not able to</text>
  <text start="445.44" dur="6.48">do a lot of things by just giving orders</text>
  <text start="448.35" dur="8.61">so people they hired if they are doing</text>
  <text start="451.92" dur="6.9">the most work and I know that there are</text>
  <text start="456.96" dur="4.11">some some good guys on the list like</text>
  <text start="458.82" dur="4.86">like Hugh has kind of alg for trey gowdy</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="4.02">a little bit and Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="463.68" dur="3.66">people have stepped down so he&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="465.09" dur="4.35">list but you know we can&amp;#39;t we can&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="467.34" dur="3.57">assume that someone on the list is a bad</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="3.18">guy we just we know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.91" dur="3.72">something going on that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="472.62" dur="3.96">going on now what what do you think I</text>
  <text start="474.63" dur="3.51">mean where are we now only where what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.58" dur="3.15">going on with all of the resignations</text>
  <text start="478.14" dur="5.76">like is there any new data that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="479.73" dur="5.55">out any new connections so in history we</text>
  <text start="483.9" dur="4.32">had a lot of very interesting</text>
  <text start="485.28" dur="5.88">connections or as you stated there are a</text>
  <text start="488.22" dur="10.08">lot of good people on the list I would</text>
  <text start="491.16" dur="10.38">actually say the majority is good we</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="8.73">need to have proof about bad things</text>
  <text start="501.54" dur="8.49">before we can call people bad people we</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="5.79">had some interesting connections or I</text>
  <text start="510.03" dur="6.78">think it was with the former CEO of the</text>
  <text start="512.82" dur="6.899">compass group who announced us I think</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="6.87">your retirement or resignation end of</text>
  <text start="519.719" dur="8.361">last year and interestingly he died on a</text>
  <text start="523.68" dur="7.08">plane crash I think on January the first</text>
  <text start="528.08" dur="5.5">later some great eminence on asian</text>
  <text start="530.76" dur="5.37">figure out that he has some</text>
  <text start="533.58" dur="4.91">connections to Clintons and the Clinton</text>
  <text start="536.13" dur="6.06">Foundation and also the Compass Group</text>
  <text start="538.49" dur="5.79">has some connections they build the I</text>
  <text start="542.19" dur="8.91">think the Clinton Presidential Library</text>
  <text start="544.28" dur="10.57">and I only with these connections I</text>
  <text start="551.1" dur="9.48">wouldn&amp;#39;t say that the company&amp;#39;s CEO is a</text>
  <text start="554.85" dur="7.98">bad guy so my big question is why yeah</text>
  <text start="560.58" dur="5.73">did he die on a plane crash sure even</text>
  <text start="562.83" dur="8.91">his family was on board maybe he was a</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="7.11">good guy and he was Q has told us that a</text>
  <text start="571.74" dur="3.51">lot of these plane crashes like most of</text>
  <text start="573.42" dur="4.47">them probably 80 70 percent I believe he</text>
  <text start="575.25" dur="4.52">said was was assassinations</text>
  <text start="577.89" dur="5.52">I mean planes don&amp;#39;t just crash often</text>
  <text start="579.77" dur="6.01">exactly on the same day or maybe 24</text>
  <text start="583.41" dur="6.48">hours later we had another plane crash</text>
  <text start="585.78" dur="6.57">with another CEO and I can&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="589.89" dur="4.59">the connections anymore but he had also</text>
  <text start="592.35" dur="4.68">some connections to well to the Clinton</text>
  <text start="594.48" dur="5.25">Foundation these people around them just</text>
  <text start="597.03" dur="5.22">keep dying and you had mentioned they</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="4.2">had built a you know AAA structure for</text>
  <text start="602.25" dur="3.69">the Clintons and that&amp;#39;s kind of just</text>
  <text start="603.93" dur="3.69">kind of on a funny side note I remember</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="4.05">like the pharaohs and many like ancient</text>
  <text start="607.62" dur="5.13">like leaders and Kings and people with</text>
  <text start="609.99" dur="4.41">power would would have like a you know</text>
  <text start="612.75" dur="3.45">an expert build a building and then kill</text>
  <text start="614.4" dur="3.96">them so all the secrets were taken to</text>
  <text start="616.2" dur="3.42">the grave I mean that was I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="618.36" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on but that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="619.62" dur="5.58">of a funny little historical note even</text>
  <text start="623.07" dur="3.87">you had mentioned you wanted to correct</text>
  <text start="625.2" dur="4.34">some of the false information going on</text>
  <text start="626.94" dur="7.65">around there what were you talking about</text>
  <text start="629.54" dur="7.3">so one of these false informations which</text>
  <text start="634.59" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;ll share to in the last few weeks and</text>
  <text start="636.84" dur="4.8">also months is that everyone on the list</text>
  <text start="639.45" dur="4.94">is bad so this is definitely not the</text>
  <text start="641.64" dur="4.8">case there are also some claims but</text>
  <text start="644.39" dur="7.35">everyone on the list will be indicted</text>
  <text start="646.44" dur="5.3">and for this we have absolutely no proof</text>
  <text start="652.55" dur="5.31">you will talk about being diagnosed a</text>
  <text start="655.05" dur="6.18">little bit later again I would suggest</text>
  <text start="657.86" dur="6.22">on the resignation website since a few</text>
  <text start="661.23" dur="5.68">weeks you can see that&amp;#39;s a number of</text>
  <text start="664.08" dur="6.82">people who got a new job</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="7.59">actually I think they have 85 people but</text>
  <text start="670.9" dur="6.09">this number is not very accurate detract</text>
  <text start="674.5" dur="4.44">or we started to track these new</text>
  <text start="676.99" dur="5.6">positions and new companies of people</text>
  <text start="678.94" dur="7.59">who resigned only a few weeks ago and</text>
  <text start="682.59" dur="9.06">this means that the I maintained the</text>
  <text start="686.53" dur="9">resignation list for months but we never</text>
  <text start="691.65" dur="8.95">made a research for new positions or new</text>
  <text start="695.53" dur="7.44">companies so we started on a speck on a</text>
  <text start="700.6" dur="6.54">specific point and that&amp;#39;s why we have</text>
  <text start="702.97" dur="6.3">only a number of 85 people unfortunately</text>
  <text start="707.14" dur="4.23">I don&amp;#39;t have the time to check off we</text>
  <text start="709.27" dur="8.52">have four thousand resignations again</text>
  <text start="711.37" dur="9.12">for four for these things so if someone</text>
  <text start="717.79" dur="6.18">wants to do this I would definitely</text>
  <text start="720.49" dur="5.85">appreciate the help but this is what I</text>
  <text start="723.97" dur="5.03">can say is that the number of people</text>
  <text start="726.34" dur="5.7">within new job is much much higher so</text>
  <text start="729" dur="6.67">especially in the healthcare sector or</text>
  <text start="732.04" dur="7.32">even in the IT sector it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="735.67" dur="7.76">normal to change your job and to start</text>
  <text start="739.36" dur="7.05">yeah some dudes later in a new company</text>
  <text start="743.43" dur="7.21">I&amp;#39;m not that old but I had a lot of</text>
  <text start="746.41" dur="6.92">companies so I resigned very often okay</text>
  <text start="750.64" dur="6.57">I&amp;#39;m not a CEO but I had also some</text>
  <text start="753.33" dur="5.83">high-ranking positions but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="757.21" dur="5.34">absolutely normal to change so if you</text>
  <text start="759.16" dur="7.41">are not happy with a company or if your</text>
  <text start="762.55" dur="7.52">job so by continuing this job for for</text>
  <text start="766.57" dur="6.72">next decades it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense so</text>
  <text start="770.07" dur="5.92">it&amp;#39;s possible to to change the company</text>
  <text start="773.29" dur="5.52">and to get a better job maybe that are</text>
  <text start="775.99" dur="5.52">paid I don&amp;#39;t know now I am you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="778.81" dur="5.07">big on on logic you know and people who</text>
  <text start="781.51" dur="6.57">watch me they understand I like even</text>
  <text start="783.88" dur="5.84">when Q has has you know pushed back when</text>
  <text start="788.08" dur="4.02">he pushed against alex jones with the</text>
  <text start="789.72" dur="4.21">with the statement about how he was a</text>
  <text start="792.1" dur="4.26">performance artist i push back even</text>
  <text start="793.93" dur="5.1">against q and and some of these q non</text>
  <text start="796.36" dur="4.98">proofs on the q proof site some of them</text>
  <text start="799.03" dur="4.2">are not good proofs and I&amp;#39;ve debunked</text>
  <text start="801.34" dur="4.46">some of the queue proofs myself now we</text>
  <text start="803.23" dur="4.95">still have over like 90 or 100 different</text>
  <text start="805.8" dur="4.63">coincidences or evidences you might say</text>
  <text start="808.18" dur="4.41">so I still am very firmly believing in</text>
  <text start="810.43" dur="4.86">queueing on but you know I want good</text>
  <text start="812.59" dur="4.8">data I come at this from an investment</text>
  <text start="815.29" dur="2.4">kind of mindset and bad data cost you</text>
  <text start="817.39" dur="2.58">money</text>
  <text start="817.69" dur="5.16">and in this case bad data could cost us</text>
  <text start="819.97" dur="4.11">the war for the world so I really want</text>
  <text start="822.85" dur="2.82">to make sure that we get as much clear</text>
  <text start="824.08" dur="3.6">data as possible so if people wanted to</text>
  <text start="825.67" dur="4.41">help you out with this and help with</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="3.36">their time and their effort how would</text>
  <text start="830.08" dur="5.73">they do that how would they go about</text>
  <text start="831.04" dur="7.38">helping you fill this in so generally</text>
  <text start="835.81" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s not possible to you have to edit</text>
  <text start="838.42" dur="6.74">the spreadsheet the only one who can do</text>
  <text start="841.12" dur="7.02">this is me but you can send me an email</text>
  <text start="845.16" dur="4.93">my email addresses the resignations at</text>
  <text start="848.14" dur="3.9">protonmail dot-com you can find this</text>

  <text start="852.04" dur="7.68">website you can try to contact me on</text>
  <text start="855.46" dur="7.71">this code and I think these are the most</text>
  <text start="859.72" dur="5.43">or the best ways to contact me and it</text>
  <text start="863.17" dur="6.3">depends a little bit on what you want to</text>
  <text start="865.15" dur="9">do so researching new positions and new</text>
  <text start="869.47" dur="7.11">companies could be one task you could</text>

  <text start="876.58" dur="3.81">researching new resignations or</text>
  <text start="878.38" dur="6.24">resignations which are not on the list</text>
  <text start="880.39" dur="7.32">yet and unfortunately I have some blank</text>
  <text start="884.62" dur="6.06">fields on the list so it would take me a</text>
  <text start="887.71" dur="5.91">lot of time to research all of these</text>
  <text start="890.68" dur="6.11">things so if you find something which is</text>
  <text start="893.62" dur="5.4">missing you can send me an email or and</text>
  <text start="896.79" dur="4.54">if you want to support me or for a</text>

  <text start="901.33" dur="11.31">some ways to yeah to improve the work</text>
  <text start="908.26" dur="7.17">and the process so it would be easy for</text>
  <text start="912.64" dur="5.07">you and easy for me to maintain data</text>

  <text start="937.6" dur="4.26">and archive it and keep keep track of</text>
  <text start="939.4" dur="3.96">everything then this is an opportunity</text>
  <text start="941.86" dur="3.9">to be part of history and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="943.36" dur="4.919">that&amp;#39;s very exciting right there I mean</text>
  <text start="945.76" dur="4.29">I don&amp;#39;t know if some of the guys I have</text>
  <text start="948.279" dur="4.56">a kind of a volunteer research team</text>
  <text start="950.05" dur="4.74">right now doing my Trello which which is</text>
  <text start="952.839" dur="3.75">a lot of the queue posts and such and</text>
  <text start="954.79" dur="3.63">gathering data for that I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="956.589" dur="3.091">they want to take on anymore but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="958.42" dur="3.33">sure someone else out there would be</text>
  <text start="959.68" dur="3.93">willing to do so and and thank you to</text>
  <text start="961.75" dur="5.1">trave AG and others who are doing that</text>

  <text start="966.85" dur="12.51">have we covered all the main points yeah</text>
  <text start="976.839" dur="6.931">please let us know where we are on that</text>
  <text start="979.36" dur="6.86">and what you know so as you may know we</text>
  <text start="983.77" dur="6.27">have a resignation list we also have a</text>
  <text start="986.22" dur="5.59">co2 indictment list and I&amp;#39;m a little bit</text>
  <text start="990.04" dur="8.54">in contact with the guy who was doing</text>
  <text start="991.81" dur="11.149">the indictment list and we tried to make</text>
  <text start="998.58" dur="9.94">connection between resignations and</text>
  <text start="1002.959" dur="10.061">indictments so some weeks ago I started</text>
  <text start="1008.52" dur="7.319">to do this and I figure out 10 people do</text>
  <text start="1013.02" dur="6.63">match the first mayor first name and</text>
  <text start="1015.839" dur="6.411">last name but unfortunately there was no</text>
  <text start="1019.65" dur="10.58">real matching because the people had</text>
  <text start="1022.25" dur="12.1">only the same name and nothing else so B</text>
  <text start="1030.23" dur="7.9">indictment mmm did some great work and</text>
  <text start="1034.35" dur="6.719">last few weeks he tried to match all of</text>
  <text start="1038.13" dur="7.77">these names again and now he figured out</text>
  <text start="1041.069" dur="7.411">that for people to really match so he</text>
  <text start="1045.9" dur="7.47">also researched these people and figured</text>
  <text start="1048.48" dur="8.19">out that they got really indicted yeah</text>
  <text start="1053.37" dur="5.07">on the resignation website you can see</text>
  <text start="1056.67" dur="3.87">in the head of it four people got</text>
  <text start="1058.44" dur="4.62">indicted so and if you click on the left</text>
  <text start="1060.54" dur="6.359">side on indictments you can see some</text>
  <text start="1063.06" dur="6.9">detail that&amp;#39;s and also links to</text>
  <text start="1066.899" dur="4.65">the indictments data and if you look</text>
  <text start="1069.96" dur="4.38">into the indictments lists you can also</text>
  <text start="1071.549" dur="7.35">find a link into the resignation list</text>
  <text start="1074.34" dur="8.069">again we try to keep these informations</text>
  <text start="1078.899" dur="6.38">up to date and yeah that&amp;#39;s basically all</text>
  <text start="1082.409" dur="5.4">that I can say so we have only four</text>
  <text start="1085.279" dur="5.02">confirmed indictments from people on the</text>
  <text start="1087.809" dur="4.32">resignation list and it&amp;#39;s not a case</text>
  <text start="1090.299" dur="5.431">that everyone on the list would be</text>
  <text start="1092.129" dur="5.101">intact of course yeah and and I would</text>
  <text start="1095.73" dur="3.51">add that you know not every single</text>
  <text start="1097.23" dur="4.169">indictment necessarily as a human being</text>
  <text start="1099.24" dur="4.799">some of them are like evidentiary or or</text>
  <text start="1101.399" dur="4.26">or maybe multiple indictments for the</text>
  <text start="1104.039" dur="3.031">same person multiple crimes things like</text>
  <text start="1105.659" dur="4.98">that you know we can&amp;#39;t know until</text>
  <text start="1107.07" dur="4.949">they&amp;#39;re unsealed so but you know to that</text>
  <text start="1110.639" dur="2.73">extent we you know people are getting</text>
  <text start="1112.019" dur="2.971">their hopes up and and I think that</text>
  <text start="1113.369" dur="2.581">there is some fire to the smoke I think</text>
  <text start="1114.99" dur="3.33">that there&amp;#39;s definitely something going</text>
  <text start="1115.95" dur="5.579">on because this this number is just</text>
  <text start="1118.32" dur="4.89">unprecedented you know both possibly in</text>
  <text start="1121.529" dur="3.9">the step downs but definitely in there</text>
  <text start="1123.21" dur="3.599">in the in the sealed indictments and</text>
  <text start="1125.429" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s never happened before that I can</text>
  <text start="1126.809" dur="5.7">think of in history a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1129.809" dur="5.82">think it&amp;#39;s just you know maybe some some</text>
  <text start="1132.509" dur="4.441">gangs like ms-13 but I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="1135.629" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s all of it</text>
  <text start="1136.95" dur="4.229">you know I really don&amp;#39;t you know even if</text>
  <text start="1139.619" dur="9.481">they if they were to Roundup anti far as</text>
  <text start="1141.179" dur="10.261">well I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s all of it so</text>
  <text start="1149.1" dur="5.039">if someone got some title it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1151.44" dur="6.949">mean that he ends in jail so as far as I</text>
  <text start="1154.139" dur="9.12">know there will be a court decision and</text>
  <text start="1158.389" dur="7.48">maybe this person is still a free free</text>
  <text start="1163.259" dur="4.951">person afterwards so one of these four</text>
  <text start="1165.869" dur="4.02">people which are on the resignation list</text>
  <text start="1168.21" dur="4.319">and the indictments list is</text>
  <text start="1169.889" dur="7.49">interestingly Michael Flynn and as far</text>
