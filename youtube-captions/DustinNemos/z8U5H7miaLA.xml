  <text start="208.76" dur="3.18">the life that we live in where even our</text>

  <text start="211.94" dur="4.29">thing that&amp;#39;s the chilling effect that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="213.86" dur="4.59">if they can get away with it that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="216.23" dur="4.8">they win if they can intimidate the few</text>
  <text start="218.45" dur="4.77">voices brave enough to speak out then</text>
  <text start="221.03" dur="4.11">they can get all of us but that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="223.22" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s so important for those of us with a</text>
  <text start="225.14" dur="4.11">voice to speak and to use it and for</text>
  <text start="227.3" dur="6.21">those of us without a voice to protect</text>
  <text start="229.25" dur="6.54">those who do have a voice like our</text>
  <text start="233.51" dur="4.05">president now we also have Mitch</text>
  <text start="235.79" dur="3.72">McConnell&amp;#39;s official campaign account</text>
  <text start="237.56" dur="3.87">locked out of Twitter for posting video</text>
  <text start="239.51" dur="3.06">of hate mob threatening McConnell of</text>
  <text start="241.43" dur="2.73">course they were surrounding his house</text>
  <text start="242.57" dur="3.27">while he was sick and recovering and</text>
  <text start="244.16" dur="3.09">saying that they wanted to stab his</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="4.5">voodoo doll in the heart and things like</text>
  <text start="247.25" dur="6.36">that nothing you know ominous about that</text>
  <text start="250.34" dur="6.899">and then continuing this is this is gold</text>
  <text start="253.61" dur="5.97">this is comedic gold MSNBC says and I</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="4.081">think this is like gematria for idiots</text>
  <text start="259.58" dur="5.9">or something but they are actually</text>
  <text start="261.32" dur="7.07">reading some code here let&amp;#39;s get this</text>
  <text start="265.48" dur="4.35">that polo that we have to understand the</text>
  <text start="268.39" dur="3.75">adversary and the threat we&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="3.93">with and if we don&amp;#39;t understand how they</text>
  <text start="272.14" dur="3.99">think we&amp;#39;ll never understand how to</text>
  <text start="273.76" dur="4.26">counter them so it&amp;#39;s a little things and</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="8.88">language and messaging that matters</text>
  <text start="278.02" dur="16.65">the president until August eighth that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="285.01" dur="14.99">eight eight that&amp;#39;s being demonstrated</text>
  <text start="294.67" dur="5.33">the numbers eight are very significant</text>
  <text start="311.94" dur="10.15">what are you serious I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="320.29" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s actually true and I really highly</text>
  <text start="322.09" dur="5.34">doubt that it is but a you know you</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t get to claim the numbers as your</text>
  <text start="327.43" dur="5.01">own and there are no significant</text>
  <text start="329.98" dur="4.28">populations if neo-nazis in the US so</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s not actually a legitimate threat</text>
  <text start="334.26" dur="3.55">even though they might pay some people</text>
  <text start="336.43" dur="2.97">every once in a while to show up in a</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="4.86">place like Charlottesville to pretend</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="5.99">that there are we know the truth now</text>
  <text start="342.67" dur="6.33">this sounds like kind of a serial brain</text>
  <text start="345.39" dur="5.83">wannabe from the mainstream media but</text>
  <text start="349" dur="6.57">you know look some people will take this</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="6.48">seriously and unfortunately it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="355.57" dur="4.86">bit nutty but it&amp;#39;s mainstream leftist</text>
  <text start="357.7" dur="4.59">talking points I mean this is or at</text>
  <text start="360.43" dur="3.27">least it could be I mean they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="362.29" dur="3.51">talk about this kind of stuff among</text>
  <text start="363.7" dur="4.5">themselves and use it to justify the the</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="6.78">whole Hitlerian everything regime of</text>
  <text start="368.2" dur="5.88">Trump in their minds so maybe not a full</text>
  <text start="372.58" dur="3.96">talking point out in the rhetoric but</text>
  <text start="374.08" dur="5.31">this kind of stuff it has a way of</text>
  <text start="376.54" dur="5.48">reinforcing what they want you know what</text>
  <text start="379.39" dur="7.35">they want to believe and and rather than</text>
  <text start="382.02" dur="6.43">then give them the facts and let them</text>
  <text start="386.74" dur="3.09">make up their own mind the media is</text>
  <text start="388.45" dur="3.9">telling people what to believe and</text>
  <text start="389.83" dur="4.65">trying to create something just anything</text>
  <text start="392.35" dur="4.38">to justify that belief they don&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="394.48" dur="3.17">know they know most people are lazy and</text>
  <text start="396.73" dur="3.2">stupid and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="397.65" dur="4.799">try very hard but this is the kind of</text>
  <text start="399.93" dur="5.61">stuff that shows you very clearly just</text>
  <text start="402.449" dur="7.621">how far it&amp;#39;s gotten just how pique crazy</text>
  <text start="405.54" dur="7.59">we&amp;#39;re at just how far they have gone and</text>
  <text start="410.07" dur="6.15">far they have fallen from a place of</text>
  <text start="413.13" dur="5.039">integrity or you know credibility or</text>
  <text start="416.22" dur="3.84">just you know even the claim of a lack</text>
  <text start="418.169" dur="3.541">of bias which I&amp;#39;ve never taken seriously</text>
  <text start="420.06" dur="3.389">in my life everyone&amp;#39;s biased you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="421.71" dur="4.11">if someone says they&amp;#39;re not by I still</text>
  <text start="423.449" dur="4.291">trust them they&amp;#39;re lying to you they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="425.82" dur="5.67">all biased in some degree and if you get</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="5.88">to be that powerful your interests well</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="4.77">your bias towards your interests you</text>
  <text start="433.62" dur="7.65">know and they they have ways of getting</text>
  <text start="436.26" dur="7.379">to you and such so this is the Democrat</text>
  <text start="441.27" dur="4.95">Queen Castro if I&amp;#39;m saying that right</text>
  <text start="443.639" dur="4.681">who Doc&amp;#39;s his own donor and recent hit</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="3.449">list that he tweeted out so I&amp;#39;m assuming</text>
  <text start="448.32" dur="5.43">he&amp;#39;s probably going to be losing some</text>
  <text start="449.669" dur="6.18">funds now in ongoing now if you have if</text>
  <text start="453.75" dur="5.13">I ever run for office or anything I</text>
  <text start="455.849" dur="6.721">promise I will not docks my donors how&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.88" dur="6.15">that anyway just a joke I doubt I ever</text>
  <text start="462.57" dur="4.349">do Democrat House candidate is also</text>
  <text start="465.03" dur="4.199">calling Democrats as calling Democrats</text>
  <text start="466.919" dur="7.591">clowns his white supremacist language</text>
  <text start="469.229" dur="6.781">now listen I know III don&amp;#39;t know why he</text>
  <text start="474.51" dur="2.58">would say that it&amp;#39;s white supremacist</text>
  <text start="476.01" dur="2.64">because there&amp;#39;s clearly nothing white</text>
  <text start="477.09" dur="6.09">supremacist about calling someone a</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="6.449">clown which in fact implies not a racial</text>
  <text start="483.18" dur="3.45">tone at all because a clown is someone</text>
  <text start="485.099" dur="4.19">that you would imagine is covered and</text>
  <text start="486.63" dur="5.219">makeup you don&amp;#39;t know what base they are</text>
  <text start="489.289" dur="4.66">but on the other hand I do know where</text>
  <text start="491.849" dur="4.56">that term clowns came from and I bet you</text>
  <text start="493.949" dur="5.371">do too this is from the cueing on</text>
  <text start="496.409" dur="5.161">movement this is the power of the cue on</text>
  <text start="499.32" dur="4.2">movement that Alex Jones says he wanted</text>
  <text start="501.57" dur="3.99">to see well here you go they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="2.55">of the terms that we&amp;#39;ve popularized like</text>
  <text start="505.56" dur="3.06">clowns</text>
  <text start="506.07" dur="6.709">what is clowns to the Q movement well</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="9.69">the CIA of course right the clowns in</text>
  <text start="512.779" dur="8.2">action so the CIA are of course the</text>
  <text start="518.31" dur="4.5">clowns and their tent tentacles their</text>
  <text start="520.979" dur="3.811">tendrils reach into of course the</text>
  <text start="522.81" dur="4.92">mainstream media and the halls of power</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="4.47">so when someone is saying you shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="527.73" dur="3.33">say the word clowns they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="6">you&amp;#39;re not allowed</text>
  <text start="531.06" dur="6.48">to criticize the CIA whether they know</text>
  <text start="535.26" dur="3.69">it or not now probably he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="537.54" dur="2.88">realize that a lot of people are just</text>
  <text start="538.95" dur="3.12">using the word and suddenly he realizes</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="4.08">his political enemies are using it so</text>
  <text start="542.07" dur="4.65">call them racist right but when you</text>
  <text start="544.5" dur="3.93">think deeper and you look from a deeper</text>
  <text start="546.72" dur="4.89">perspective a little higher up in the</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="4.62">sky a little bit perspective you know we</text>
  <text start="551.61" dur="2.64">try to cover the twenty or forty</text>
  <text start="553.05" dur="3.75">thousand foot view on this show</text>
  <text start="554.25" dur="7.56">sometimes even the sixty thousand but</text>
  <text start="556.8" dur="7.92">here we go continuing on we have one of</text>
  <text start="561.81" dur="5.49">the Democrat Doc&amp;#39;s victims and this is</text>
  <text start="564.72" dur="4.23">of course it again yaqeen Castro is</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="5.64">coming out and saying quote what is he</text>
  <text start="568.95" dur="6.93">hoping for one of us will get shot so</text>
  <text start="572.94" dur="5.94">this you know this is very powerful this</text>
  <text start="575.88" dur="5.94">is a mark Hanrahan the CEO of Mid</text>

  <text start="581.82" dur="4.77">this week after he was doxxed and that</text>
  <text start="585" dur="4.32">tells you right there they they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="586.59" dur="4.59">putting people in danger they are trying</text>
  <text start="589.32" dur="3.27">to put people in danger and then still</text>
  <text start="591.18" dur="2.82">maintain plausible deniability but we</text>
  <text start="592.59" dur="3.96">all see what&amp;#39;s going on we all know</text>
  <text start="594" dur="4.23">what&amp;#39;s going on so we all have to</text>
  <text start="596.55" dur="3.63">prepare accordingly and react</text>
  <text start="598.23" dur="5.85">accordingly you know and of course that</text>
  <text start="600.18" dur="6.96">means defend your home of course but in</text>
  <text start="604.08" dur="4.98">a non-violent way that&amp;#39;s of course push</text>
  <text start="607.14" dur="6.03">for transparency let&amp;#39;s of course push</text>
  <text start="609.06" dur="6.96">for free access to the free marketplace</text>

  <text start="616.02" dur="4.38">speak where most of information is</text>
  <text start="618.57" dur="3.72">transferred now social media platforms</text>
  <text start="620.4" dur="5.79">so we can continue to argue this with</text>
  <text start="622.29" dur="5.46">our words and and not our fists because</text>
  <text start="626.19" dur="3.33">you know this show is about non-violence</text>
  <text start="627.75" dur="4.95">and I personally follow the</text>
