  <text start="94.369" dur="5.271">leaving it down intentionally for now</text>
  <text start="97" dur="5.17">just to comply with I guess whatever</text>
  <text start="99.64" dur="5.35">congressional questioning that they have</text>
  <text start="102.17" dur="4.41">which is obviously it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="104.99" dur="2.97">insulting it&amp;#39;s stupid anyway he should</text>

  <text start="134.15" dur="6.24">censorship that&amp;#39;s going on these days</text>
  <text start="137.44" dur="7.09">let&amp;#39;s see what was it I save stuff</text>

  <text start="149.989" dur="4.851">away and I&amp;#39;ve got everything in one</text>
  <text start="151.61" dur="3.23">tweet that&amp;#39;s really convenient</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="2.69">see</text>
  <text start="164.54" dur="13.35">had it there somewhere there we go</text>
  <text start="174.549" dur="5.981">okay so we had a bunch of the violence</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="3.989">in Portland of course I think only 13</text>
  <text start="180.53" dur="3.42">were arrested right but they were all</text>
  <text start="181.879" dur="4.951">Antipa that was a big deal</text>
  <text start="183.95" dur="7.83">cuz that destroys their their narrative</text>
  <text start="186.83" dur="7.65">doesn&amp;#39;t it a little bit how inconvenient</text>
  <text start="191.78" dur="5.819">and then yeah chase says the Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="194.48" dur="5.399">protests yeah of course the Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="197.599" dur="3.571">protests are getting more violent</text>
  <text start="199.879" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;re out there in the rain now</text>
  <text start="201.17" dur="4.08">umbrellas out which may or may not I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="204.23" dur="2.58">not sure if that has anything to do with</text>
  <text start="205.25" dur="3.81">the umbrella protest movement as well</text>
  <text start="206.81" dur="4.92">but yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just a bigger version</text>
  <text start="209.06" dur="5.67">right like it&amp;#39;s just a huge protest now</text>
  <text start="211.73" dur="4.319">and they don&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t go backwards</text>
  <text start="214.73" dur="4.89">this is not going backwards it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="216.049" dur="5.16">revolution Emperor jumping over there</text>
  <text start="219.62" dur="4.679">and I call him Emperor because remember</text>
  <text start="221.209" dur="5.221">he&amp;#39;s now president for life is now</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="3.72">trying to consolidate his power I mean</text>
  <text start="226.43" dur="3.77">he&amp;#39;s expanding in the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="228.019" dur="4.861">Trump has contested him there and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.2" dur="5.86">that started off a lot of other problems</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="5.759">right we&amp;#39;re also selling more weaponry</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="4.829">than ever I guess to Taiwan so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.639" dur="4.71">gonna make them unhappy as well kind of</text>
  <text start="240.889" dur="8.311">hem them in a bit it&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="243.349" dur="7.801">geopolitical chess game so of course he</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="5.969">has to consolidate power in the</text>
  <text start="251.15" dur="8.579">heartland because Hong Kong stands as an</text>
  <text start="255.169" dur="10.981">example that his way is not the best way</text>
  <text start="259.729" dur="9.421">so yeah it&amp;#39;s kind of like a yellow vest</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="6">in China I mean it&amp;#39;s slightly different</text>
  <text start="269.15" dur="4.199">but yeah they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re all they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="272.15" dur="5.34">lot of what they&amp;#39;re doing is more</text>
  <text start="273.349" dur="6.75">focused on kind of their own City and</text>
  <text start="277.49" dur="5.51">being extradited to mainland China</text>
  <text start="280.099" dur="5.281">because they have actual rights there</text>
  <text start="283" dur="4.449">compared to mainland Chinese citizens</text>
  <text start="285.38" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t have as many rights because the</text>
  <text start="287.449" dur="5.011">two difference two different policies</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="5.94">thing that left when the UK kind of left</text>
  <text start="292.46" dur="4.889">Hong Kong in Chinese rule but with its</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="3">own system that was supposed to expire</text>
  <text start="297.349" dur="3.451">eventually but</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="5.73">yet and they don&amp;#39;t want to have to be</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="4.41">subjected to Chinese justice they want</text>
  <text start="304.07" dur="4.23">to have to go through their own much</text>
  <text start="305.21" dur="5.82">more fair justice system but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="7.649">gonna last much longer they&amp;#39;re a tiny</text>
  <text start="311.03" dur="6.93">island amidst everything else huge</text>

  <text start="469.44" dur="4.77">of you know you know police and and</text>

  <text start="556.88" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re not like the bastions of</text>
  <text start="559.86" dur="4.29">articulation all the time or anything</text>
  <text start="561.75" dur="4.29">some of them would do let&amp;#39;s be honest</text>
  <text start="564.15" dur="3.99">they would love to pound some of these</text>
  <text start="566.04" dur="3.51">antiva folks but they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re purely</text>
  <text start="568.14" dur="3.39">defensive they&amp;#39;re not out there like</text>
  <text start="569.55" dur="3.93">attacking people and they know what</text>
  <text start="571.53" dur="3">optics are like they understand optics</text>
  <text start="573.48" dur="3.27">they&amp;#39;re not idiots</text>
  <text start="574.53" dur="5.4">most of them and and certainly not the</text>
  <text start="576.75" dur="4.56">folks who run in the show so if any of</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="4.23">them had brought a hammer they would</text>
  <text start="581.31" dur="5.34">have probably been kicked out so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.16" dur="5.91">not how probable is role but leaders we</text>
  <text start="586.65" dur="6.54">have seen an tyfa play that way many</text>

  <text start="595.5" dur="8.01">that it&amp;#39;s scary what they&amp;#39;re not only</text>
  <text start="601.53" dur="7.23">capable of doing but fully willing to</text>
  <text start="603.51" dur="8.88">endorse but I&amp;#39;m still pretty optimistic</text>
  <text start="608.76" dur="5.82">I mean this means that it&amp;#39;s almost the</text>
  <text start="612.39" dur="5.76">end of ante fo you know that&amp;#39;s what this</text>
  <text start="614.58" dur="12.78">means it&amp;#39;s really coming to a to a</text>

  <text start="711.02" dur="6.09">friend you must be new here</text>
  <text start="712.85" dur="6.06">welcome so basically we have now years</text>
  <text start="717.11" dur="4.62">of experience of him predicting the</text>
  <text start="718.91" dur="4.32">future playing around these word games</text>
  <text start="721.73" dur="2.82">with President Trump on Twitter where</text>
  <text start="723.23" dur="2.76">they&amp;#39;re practically finishing each</text>
  <text start="724.55" dur="4.65">other&amp;#39;s sentences or posting at the</text>
  <text start="725.99" dur="4.95">exact same second in some cases and we</text>
  <text start="729.2" dur="4.17">have all these hat tips from President</text>
  <text start="730.94" dur="4.08">Trump himself and just tons and tons and</text>
  <text start="733.37" dur="5.16">tons and tons of coincidence beyond any</text>
  <text start="735.02" dur="5.49">mathematical odds so it&amp;#39;s one of those</text>
  <text start="738.53" dur="4.29">things where you can kind of choose to</text>
  <text start="740.51" dur="6.06">live in ignorance but mathematically</text>
  <text start="742.82" dur="5.76">speaking like it defies the odds of</text>
  <text start="746.57" dur="4.77">probability a little bit that you would</text>
  <text start="748.58" dur="4.59">say q is not real in some sense what</text>
