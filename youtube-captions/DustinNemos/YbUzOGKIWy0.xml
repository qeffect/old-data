  <text start="133.22" dur="5.1">they were poisoned Monica Rick&amp;#39;s PacSun</text>
  <text start="136.13" dur="4.199">discovered a recovered sorry slowly from</text>
  <text start="138.32" dur="4.05">the poison but her husband Philippe was</text>
  <text start="140.329" dur="4.761">not as fortunate and subsequently died</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="5.61">at this October 3rd 2019 the</text>
  <text start="145.09" dur="5.02">best-selling qyn on book cueing on an</text>
  <text start="147.98" dur="5.7">invitation to the Great Awakening was</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="6.09">originally released in February 26 2019</text>
  <text start="153.68" dur="3.529">they quickly shot up to number two spot</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="3.86">before</text>
  <text start="157.209" dur="4.351">interestingly computer anomalies arose</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="4.289">that block sales you guys may remember</text>
  <text start="161.56" dur="5.37">they were messing with our confirmed</text>
  <text start="164.349" dur="4.651">purchases and reviews and hundreds of</text>
  <text start="166.93" dur="3.54">confirmed reviews were not found so that</text>
  <text start="169" dur="5.489">we could not make it to number one in</text>
  <text start="170.47" dur="5.909">time ironically right as not only the</text>
  <text start="174.489" dur="3.78">mccabe deep state book came up against</text>
  <text start="176.379" dur="4.47">the queue and on book and we demolished</text>
  <text start="178.269" dur="6.33">that one we way out sold that book but</text>
  <text start="180.849" dur="5.461">then the second I guess thing that</text>
  <text start="184.599" dur="3.78">Amazon really couldn&amp;#39;t handle is that we</text>
  <text start="186.31" dur="3.929">were you know kind of beating a Michelle</text>
  <text start="188.379" dur="4.11">Obama&amp;#39;s book I think it was called</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="4.711">becoming or whatever about becoming a</text>
  <text start="192.489" dur="5.22">woman I don&amp;#39;t know but that particular</text>
  <text start="194.95" dur="4.379">book was doing badly against us as well</text>
  <text start="197.709" dur="3.42">until they started to really ramp up</text>
  <text start="199.329" dur="3.391">kind of the algorithm change and then</text>
  <text start="201.129" dur="3.81">some of the suspicious behaviors around</text>
  <text start="202.72" dur="3.96">the c&amp;#39;mon book so hundreds of confirmed</text>
  <text start="204.939" dur="3.481">purchase reviews dropped the price</text>
  <text start="206.68" dur="3.779">dropping when it was supposed to go up</text>
  <text start="208.42" dur="3.689">because it was very popular so you know</text>
  <text start="210.459" dur="4.2">you don&amp;#39;t control the price Amazon does</text>
  <text start="212.109" dur="4.08">and they sort of you know mess with</text>
  <text start="214.659" dur="3.3">things to mess with us and make it so</text>
  <text start="216.189" dur="3.66">that we couldn&amp;#39;t even earn much money on</text>
  <text start="217.959" dur="3.631">the book so they they tried to do</text>
  <text start="219.849" dur="5.07">everything they could to stop this book</text>
  <text start="221.59" dur="5.34">and it just didn&amp;#39;t work now we also have</text>
  <text start="224.919" dur="3.75">Monica Rick&amp;#39;s Paxton is a fighter and</text>
