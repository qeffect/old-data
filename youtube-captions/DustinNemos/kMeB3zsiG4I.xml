  <text start="6.93" dur="5.22">joined once again by my friend John J</text>
  <text start="9.36" dur="5.279">singleton founder of ace of coins calm</text>
  <text start="12.15" dur="3.899">kind of a privacy expert I was just</text>
  <text start="14.639" dur="3.511">joking I introduced him as my loophole</text>
  <text start="16.049" dur="3.601">guy but he&amp;#39;s got some very interesting</text>
  <text start="18.15" dur="3.78">information and we&amp;#39;re gonna go over that</text>
  <text start="19.65" dur="4.2">it relates to the crypto world it</text>
  <text start="21.93" dur="4.56">relates to setting things up in a</text>
  <text start="23.85" dur="5.37">structural form to best benefit yourself</text>
  <text start="26.49" dur="6.69">your assets or your your privacy or</text>
  <text start="29.22" dur="5.58">protection so John you you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="2.82">done some books you&amp;#39;ve been in this</text>
  <text start="34.8" dur="3.12">field for a while would you like to</text>
  <text start="36" dur="3.42">introduce yourself kind of for those who</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t know you already yeah Thank You</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="3.93">Dustin yeah for about 25 years</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="3.96">what I focused on in the beginning was</text>
  <text start="43.35" dur="4.77">consumer debt people with lots of debt</text>
  <text start="45.57" dur="5.04">so I&amp;#39;d restructure the way they had used</text>
  <text start="48.12" dur="4.5">their money and reduced their exposure</text>
  <text start="50.61" dur="2.73">to collections by making people</text>
  <text start="52.62" dur="2.369">judgment-proof</text>
  <text start="53.34" dur="3.87">and then I focused on small businesses</text>
  <text start="54.989" dur="5.581">and I did what I call re organizations</text>
  <text start="57.21" dur="5.579">so more like risk management and over</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="4.019">the years I&amp;#39;ve developed strategies to</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="3.661">help people manage windfalls</text>
  <text start="64.589" dur="4.14">like if someone were to sell a business</text>
  <text start="66.45" dur="4.2">or piece of real estate and want to know</text>
  <text start="68.729" dur="5.341">what to do with that cash maybe they</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="4.71">want to avoid risks to the dollar you</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="3.81">know primarily people won or they might</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="4.079">want to avoid risks to taxation so I</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="3.18">call it with structures for that and now</text>
  <text start="79.439" dur="3.991">with kryptos it&amp;#39;s a little bit different</text>
  <text start="81.06" dur="3.36">I mean it&amp;#39;s just another asset but it is</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="3.299">it different there&amp;#39;s a different way to</text>
  <text start="84.42" dur="4.89">look at it because the crypto graphic</text>
  <text start="86.729" dur="5.341">currency involves these exchanges and it</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="4.68">becomes easy to use an exchange because</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s user friendly then the problem is</text>
  <text start="93.99" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re being police so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="96.27" dur="5.43">come up with techniques on how to move</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="5.339">money through the exchangers and also do</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="6.72">it in a tax-free way or text deferred</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="5.82">way let&amp;#39;s say very neat okay so I want</text>
  <text start="108.42" dur="2.76">to I want to learn all about this and I</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="3.841">know we&amp;#39;ve talked about it before and</text>
  <text start="111.18" dur="4.229">I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve been full of questions and I</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="4.799">probably pestered your your email inbox</text>
  <text start="115.409" dur="4.92">too many times but this is important</text>
  <text start="118.439" dur="4.351">information as we go into this digital</text>
  <text start="120.329" dur="4.86">age of the rot you might say it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="122.79" dur="4.859">rise of crypto era I mean we saw the</text>
  <text start="125.189" dur="4.71">internet go from from dial-up with that</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="4.081">really irritating noise to what it is</text>
  <text start="129.899" dur="3.601">now where we&amp;#39;re having this kind of a</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="3.72">conversation from you know</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="5.16">probably our personal homes just really</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="4.95">convenient crypto is the next thing and</text>
  <text start="138.66" dur="4.32">I really do believe that I think it has</text>
  <text start="140.4" dur="5.85">benefits even over gold and silver which</text>
  <text start="142.98" dur="5.64">I you know I adore but this is something</text>
  <text start="146.25" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s new and it&amp;#39;s gonna stick around I</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="2.82">guess a lot of people think it&amp;#39;s a fad</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="5.63">it&amp;#39;s temporary it only seems to be</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="7.41">getting stronger and more ingrained so</text>
  <text start="155.6" dur="5.29">what do you suggest first of all because</text>
  <text start="158.85" dur="4.26">most of my audience are new to crypto or</text>
  <text start="160.89" dur="4.8">are very wary of crypto or older you</text>
  <text start="163.11" dur="5.67">know what do you suggest for people in</text>
  <text start="165.69" dur="5.37">terms of this market this timing we just</text>
  <text start="168.78" dur="4.14">have this big crash and then in terms of</text>
  <text start="171.06" dur="3.96">getting in and a smart way to protect</text>
  <text start="172.92" dur="3.81">themselves long term well I always</text>
  <text start="175.02" dur="3.12">recommend buying a Kryptos it is the</text>
  <text start="176.73" dur="4.05">future you&amp;#39;re not gonna argue your way</text>
  <text start="178.14" dur="4.74">out of it and like it or not it is the</text>
  <text start="180.78" dur="4.65">future and it&amp;#39;s of your commitment it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.88" dur="5.4">not ten years and I look at it like</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="4.68">learning how to use money in a mature</text>
  <text start="188.28" dur="2.94">way okay so as we get older we learn</text>
  <text start="190.11" dur="3.15">different ways of using money</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="4.65">unfortunately we use a lot we learned a</text>
  <text start="193.26" dur="4.949">lot of ways of getting into debt so but</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="4.56">with Kryptos it&amp;#39;s a different world but</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="4.231">it is the future and I look at it like</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="3.75">learning how to use a credit card for</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="3.87">the first time or writing a check I</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="4.529">don&amp;#39;t know if most probably most of us</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="6.45">remember getting our first cheques doing</text>
  <text start="208.709" dur="5.581">a great job yeah yeah so it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="4.199">like that except there&amp;#39;s no generation</text>
  <text start="214.29" dur="4.199">before us about cryptos the only example</text>
  <text start="216.959" dur="3.601">we have are the geeks that created it</text>
  <text start="218.489" dur="3.451">and hopefully they&amp;#39;ve created platforms</text>
  <text start="220.56" dur="5.37">that make it easy for us to use them but</text>
  <text start="221.94" dur="6.09">definitely start learning get with local</text>
  <text start="225.93" dur="5.49">meetup groups go online watch youtube</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="5.22">videos and get some you actually go</text>
  <text start="231.42" dur="4.319">through these decentralized exchangers</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="6.63">like there&amp;#39;s one called wall of coins I</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="5.641">think bitshares is another one this</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="3.06">square is another one you want to go</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="3.66">through these decentralized exchanges</text>
  <text start="242.94" dur="4.049">but of course it&amp;#39;s a good idea to use</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="4.979">things like coinbase even though</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="5.401">coinbase is regulated it&amp;#39;s still a nice</text>
  <text start="250.019" dur="5.131">way to start learning learn about how</text>
  <text start="252.39" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re the money is stored the private</text>
  <text start="255.15" dur="4.74">wallet the private key and the public</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="5.46">key and all these things and then when I</text>
  <text start="259.89" dur="4.83">say buy some I&amp;#39;m not saying sell your</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="3.36">trade out your 401k and go heavy I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="2.23">just saying</text>
  <text start="265.95" dur="3.13">put 25</text>
  <text start="266.95" dur="3.87">bucks a week like if you have if your</text>
  <text start="269.08" dur="3.69">grocery bill is you know $150 a week</text>
  <text start="270.82" dur="4.32">throw in another 20 bucks and buy some</text>
  <text start="272.77" dur="4.71">Kryptos and do that every week you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="275.14" dur="3.45">done a regular basis yeah and with when</text>
  <text start="277.48" dur="2.82">you&amp;#39;re starting out you can do it with</text>
  <text start="278.59" dur="3.75">just a few dollars in practice and you</text>
  <text start="280.3" dur="4.65">treat it like a throw away even if you</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="3.93">mess up something that&amp;#39;s a good idea too</text>
  <text start="284.95" dur="3.21">because I&amp;#39;ve heard people make a mistake</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="3.15">and they it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="288.16" dur="2.52">all the time but sometimes you make a</text>
  <text start="289.42" dur="3.81">mistake maybe you forgot your password</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="4.35">and you can&amp;#39;t recover it and yeah one of</text>
  <text start="293.23" dur="3.24">the pitfalls of this decentralized money</text>
  <text start="295.03" dur="2.85">is there&amp;#39;s no one that can like pull you</text>
  <text start="296.47" dur="3.81">out of a mistake if you send it most</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="3.87">address it&amp;#39;s gone yeah yeah when you</text>
  <text start="300.28" dur="2.91">have real security but and that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="301.75" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s all on you so you see that be aware</text>
  <text start="303.19" dur="3.21">of that but just like anything else I</text>
  <text start="305.23" dur="3.72">mean we learn how to deal with all kinds</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="4.17">of risks you know so we can do that we</text>
  <text start="308.95" dur="3.3">can handle it well I like a hundred</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="5.24">percent of my security to be you know</text>
  <text start="312.25" dur="6.09">something I can control which is yeah so</text>
  <text start="315.81" dur="4.03">we talked a little bit about you had</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="2.94">mentioned that a lot of people were</text>
  <text start="319.84" dur="4.2">interested in the idea of moving a lot</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="5.22">of currency into and out of these assets</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="4.2">and then your strategies to defer things</text>
  <text start="326.5" dur="3.24">like that but you know we&amp;#39;ve touched a</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="3.03">little bit on this already but as we</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="3.75">have this conversation what are some of</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="3.51">the primary takeaways that people will</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="2.79">you know if they&amp;#39;re interested in</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="4.62">sticking around for this not everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.28" dur="4.86">into crypto have from this I mean you</text>
  <text start="339.4" dur="3.84">offer some valuable points on a lot of</text>
  <text start="341.14" dur="4.65">different areas well there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.24" dur="4.92">risks associated with large sums of</text>
  <text start="345.79" dur="4.2">money and obviously so one risk is</text>
  <text start="348.16" dur="4.08">yourself if you don&amp;#39;t know how to deal</text>
  <text start="349.99" dur="4.11">with it then you are the risk because</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="3.75">you won&amp;#39;t know what to do with it or</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="4.17">where to put it or things like that so</text>
  <text start="355.99" dur="4.5">with any any type of situation like that</text>
  <text start="358.27" dur="4.32">I recommend that people have an asset</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="4.26">schedule or a list of assets or things</text>
  <text start="362.59" dur="5.07">where they can put money into and and</text>
  <text start="364.75" dur="5.34">that&amp;#39;s limited by for the most part it</text>
  <text start="367.66" dur="3.81">should be limited by your knowledge or</text>
  <text start="370.09" dur="2.55">your ability to gain the knowledge of</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="2.13">something like real estate it&amp;#39;s always a</text>
  <text start="372.64" dur="2.61">good one because you can gain the</text>
  <text start="373.6" dur="3.03">knowledge for real estate and you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="375.25" dur="3.57">go wrong with real Semyon pretty much</text>
  <text start="376.63" dur="4.47">you almost can&amp;#39;t go along with it you</text>
  <text start="378.82" dur="7.05">know and you can it&amp;#39;s easy to find help</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="6.75">on real estate yeah so what I recommend</text>
  <text start="385.87" dur="3.54">when you&amp;#39;re dealing with let&amp;#39;s say I</text>
  <text start="387.85" dur="3.93">know a lot of us already kryptos and</text>
  <text start="389.41" dur="4.71">we&amp;#39;re waiting to get some nice windfalls</text>
  <text start="391.78" dur="3.51">I think that&amp;#39;s happening maybe it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="394.12" dur="3.21">going to be in a month maybe it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="395.29" dur="4.11">be in six months but then in six months</text>
  <text start="397.33" dur="3.119">if we get a nice change in the pricing</text>
  <text start="399.4" dur="3.9">with</text>
  <text start="400.449" dur="4.68">say that we want to spell at that point</text>
  <text start="403.3" dur="4.769">I mean you gotta think about that but</text>
  <text start="405.129" dur="5.19">how do you manage this type of money and</text>
  <text start="408.069" dur="3.78">I recommend a structure at least a</text>
  <text start="410.319" dur="4.201">company I mean no one says you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="411.849" dur="4.44">required to manage money in your name I</text>
  <text start="414.52" dur="3.69">know all of us have personal bank</text>
  <text start="416.289" dur="3.451">accounts but we&amp;#39;re not required to you</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="2.91">can manage money outside of your name</text>
  <text start="419.74" dur="4.34">and there&amp;#39;s many benefits of doing that</text>
  <text start="421.12" dur="6.599">but I really recommend using a structure</text>
  <text start="424.08" dur="5.38">that&amp;#39;s that you control like a company I</text>
  <text start="427.719" dur="4.53">always recommend a limited liability</text>
  <text start="429.46" dur="4.22">company it&amp;#39;s so easy to use those when</text>
  <text start="432.249" dur="3.39">you&amp;#39;re done using them you can sell them</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="3.88">you know there are no capitalization</text>
  <text start="435.639" dur="4.2">requirements and I use them as a</text>
  <text start="437.56" dur="3.9">pass-through or a flow-through so I can</text>
  <text start="439.839" dur="4.17">take a million dollars and put it in my</text>
  <text start="441.46" dur="4.109">account and then I can move it the next</text>
  <text start="444.009" dur="3.421">hour over now the bank might freeze it</text>
  <text start="445.569" dur="3.84">or something temporarily but as long as</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="3.75">I keep the money in the system and I</text>
  <text start="449.409" dur="4.56">don&amp;#39;t try to take out a suitcase of cash</text>
  <text start="451.18" dur="5.159">all right I&amp;#39;m gonna be fine so I use it</text>
  <text start="453.969" dur="4.831">that way I can I can plan my taxes like</text>
  <text start="456.339" dur="6.06">for example if I&amp;#39;m in let&amp;#39;s say New</text>
  <text start="458.8" dur="5.549">Zealand I can&amp;#39;t get the same benefits as</text>
  <text start="462.399" dur="3.33">I would in the States where I can I can</text>
  <text start="464.349" dur="3.271">move money to Ana limited liability</text>
  <text start="465.729" dur="3.75">company and I can I can just sit on it I</text>
  <text start="467.62" dur="3.359">don&amp;#39;t need to report anything on it and</text>
  <text start="469.479" dur="3.601">I can move it to another asset and then</text>
  <text start="470.979" dur="4.081">I compare to taxes once I get to my next</text>
  <text start="473.08" dur="4.5">investment where in New Zealand I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="475.06" dur="4.62">a I&amp;#39;ve got a report and pay based on the</text>
  <text start="477.58" dur="4.29">value even if I don&amp;#39;t turn my asset into</text>
  <text start="479.68" dur="3.419">the local cash so it&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="481.87" dur="3.299">different in New Zealand it&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="483.099" dur="4.35">in the UK there are benefits but</text>
  <text start="485.169" dur="5.191">nonetheless I really think it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="487.449" dur="5.37">idea to use a company yeah it makes</text>
  <text start="490.36" dur="4.95">sense I mean I I shy away from all of</text>
  <text start="492.819" dur="5.22">those regulatory hurdles I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="495.31" dur="5.789">been a business guy but kind of on the</text>
  <text start="498.039" dur="5.31">on the almost a giris edges of society</text>
  <text start="501.099" dur="5.85">you know I just try to avoid as much of</text>
  <text start="503.349" dur="5.641">the headache as possible taxes and and</text>
  <text start="506.949" dur="3.27">the IRS and I just don&amp;#39;t want to feel</text>
  <text start="508.99" dur="2.489">like a slave and I always feel like a</text>
  <text start="510.219" dur="3.51">slave when I&amp;#39;m dealing with those guys</text>

  <text start="529.75" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re getting sued they get the IRS</text>
  <text start="531.22" dur="2.1">shutting them down all the stuff it all</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="3.599">happens at once</text>
  <text start="533.32" dur="5.55">so what I do is I restructure the cash</text>
  <text start="536.139" dur="5.64">flow I create a new company or to move</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="4.649">the cash flow around i reorganize how</text>
  <text start="541.779" dur="3.42">the cash is being used in the company so</text>
  <text start="543.519" dur="3.151">the company keeps functioning its</text>
  <text start="545.199" dur="3.361">accounting function is the same they</text>
  <text start="546.67" dur="4.44">still do the same thing as always it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="548.56" dur="5.209">just that all these third parties that</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="4.919">want to take the money mm-hmm yet</text>
  <text start="553.769" dur="4.601">because I restructured it I did it</text>
  <text start="556.029" dur="4.74">legally they just can&amp;#39;t do it it&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="4.079">like if you owed to people and paid one</text>
  <text start="560.769" dur="4.021">first the other one couldn&amp;#39;t complain</text>
  <text start="562.449" dur="6.39">against the up guy you paid he just has</text>
  <text start="564.79" dur="5.58">to deal with it yeah yeah yeah how did</text>
  <text start="568.839" dur="3.87">you come across all these originally</text>
  <text start="570.37" dur="5.1">like what spurred your interest well I</text>
  <text start="572.709" dur="5.82">was this gosh this is back in college</text>
  <text start="575.47" dur="4.919">and I had written a thesis on how to how</text>
  <text start="578.529" dur="4.74">to teach children in elementary school</text>
  <text start="580.389" dur="4.5">how to learn high school algebra and my</text>
  <text start="583.269" dur="3.331">teachers they both yeah my professor</text>
  <text start="584.889" dur="4.5">said water why don&amp;#39;t you do that I said</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="4.799">what he means to who go do that go to</text>
  <text start="589.389" dur="3.421">the elementary schools and teach him the</text>
  <text start="591.399" dur="3.87">high school algebra and then show me the</text>
  <text start="592.81" dur="3.899">results so I thought about it and I put</text>
  <text start="595.269" dur="3.271">together a whole program and I did it</text>
  <text start="596.709" dur="4.291">and it was actually a business and so I</text>
  <text start="598.54" dur="3.9">was doing that and then I went I wanted</text>
  <text start="601" dur="3.569">to scale it up it was doing really well</text>
  <text start="602.44" dur="3.3">I mean I couldn&amp;#39;t keep the product on</text>
  <text start="604.569" dur="5.041">the shelf it was like board games</text>
  <text start="605.74" dur="5.339">basically so I went did some research to</text>
  <text start="609.61" dur="4.77">see what kind of competition there was</text>
  <text start="611.079" dur="4.591">and I just was I just was awoken to the</text>
  <text start="614.38" dur="3.18">fact that there was way too much</text>
  <text start="615.67" dur="3.719">competition for what I wanted like I</text>
  <text start="617.56" dur="3.93">didn&amp;#39;t want to make a program and have</text>
  <text start="619.389" dur="4.68">Milton Bradley buy me out and then</text>
  <text start="621.49" dur="4.079">control what happens to it right so I I</text>
  <text start="624.069" dur="2.551">got out of that so I was at that point I</text>
  <text start="625.569" dur="2.491">was looking around and I kept hearing</text>
  <text start="626.62" dur="3.24">consumer debt credit card debt this is</text>
  <text start="628.06" dur="3.45">back in the you know the early nineties</text>
  <text start="629.86" dur="3.81">and I thought well that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="631.51" dur="3.99">that there&amp;#39;s probably a market there I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="633.67" dur="3.479">gonna go check that out so I went talked</text>
  <text start="635.5" dur="3.63">a bunch of debt collection companies I</text>
  <text start="637.149" dur="3.781">literally went to their offices and sat</text>
  <text start="639.13" dur="3.449">with them and I asked him hey how does</text>
  <text start="640.93" dur="3.54">this system work who are your suppliers</text>
  <text start="642.579" dur="3.091">what happens if a guy tells you to go</text>
  <text start="644.47" dur="2.369">pound sand what are you gonna do what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.67" dur="2.94">your remedy right I asked all these</text>
  <text start="646.839" dur="3.091">questions and then I went sat in the</text>
  <text start="648.61" dur="3.87">court where they were like suing people</text>
  <text start="649.93" dur="4.889">mm-hmm and I and I basically reversed</text>
  <text start="652.48" dur="4.68">reverse engineered the collection</text>
  <text start="654.819" dur="4.2">process and that&amp;#39;s how I figured it out</text>
  <text start="657.16" dur="3.81">by just taking my time slowing down</text>
  <text start="659.019" dur="4.56">analyzing what was going on and I</text>
  <text start="660.97" dur="4.44">realized after about three years of</text>
  <text start="663.579" dur="2.611">doing the work back in the 90s I</text>
  <text start="665.41" dur="3.84">realized</text>
  <text start="666.19" dur="5.46">if the client didn&amp;#39;t have the money or</text>
  <text start="669.25" dur="3.87">the property to take well then they</text>
  <text start="671.65" dur="4.05">don&amp;#39;t mess with you yeah he was</text>
  <text start="673.12" dur="3.75">protected so that figured how do I make</text>
  <text start="675.7" dur="3.48">it so the client doesn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="676.87" dur="3.63">property anymore how do I remove his</text>
  <text start="679.18" dur="3.15">rights to the property well it&amp;#39;s real</text>
  <text start="680.5" dur="3.42">easy like on a bank account if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="682.33" dur="2.28">starting on my checks it&amp;#39;s my personal</text>
  <text start="683.92" dur="2.66">account wall</text>
  <text start="684.61" dur="5.4">anybody who sues me can take that money</text>
  <text start="686.58" dur="5.62">but if if on the signature card I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="690.01" dur="4.98">have the right to spend the money in my</text>
  <text start="692.2" dur="4.4">name then anybody who sues me included</text>
  <text start="694.99" dur="3.9">the IRS who wants to take money cannot</text>
  <text start="696.6" dur="4.72">so if I just change the rights on the</text>
  <text start="698.89" dur="3.93">signature card mm-hmm check my suit how</text>
  <text start="701.32" dur="2.85">do I do that how do I change the rights</text>
  <text start="702.82" dur="3.93">on the seizure card and so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="704.17" dur="4.62">list of ways to do that and just company</text>
  <text start="706.75" dur="4.74">owns it but then you control the company</text>
  <text start="708.79" dur="5.01">so it&amp;#39;s your yeah either way em you you</text>
  <text start="711.49" dur="4.59">uh you divest your exclusive right to</text>
  <text start="713.8" dur="3.93">spend or sell property and with that one</text>
  <text start="716.08" dur="3.51">principle I was able to reverse engineer</text>
  <text start="717.73" dur="3.72">the whole thing all the way up to the</text>
  <text start="719.59" dur="4.62">only thing I can&amp;#39;t get around I mean I</text>
  <text start="721.45" dur="6.51">can in some cases but it&amp;#39;s student loan</text>
  <text start="724.21" dur="6.15">and IRS levies on pensions I can&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="727.96" dur="4.47">those but I can get rid of all the other</text>
  <text start="730.36" dur="4.02">I mean treated like 98 percent of all</text>
  <text start="732.43" dur="4.47">the collections out there is of no</text>
  <text start="734.38" dur="4.44">consequence and you&amp;#39;ve had you know</text>
  <text start="736.9" dur="4.5">multiple instances where this has been</text>
  <text start="738.82" dur="4.98">tried and tested and you know premium to</text>
  <text start="741.4" dur="4.38">your satisfaction oh yeah yeah yeah I</text>
  <text start="743.8" dur="4.29">mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gone through every every</text>
  <text start="745.78" dur="4.29">iteration you can imagine I mean I back</text>
  <text start="748.09" dur="5.4">in the early and that Everly may well</text>
  <text start="750.07" dur="5.19">see you about yeah in 2004 so the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="753.49" dur="4.86">finally figured out that the last</text>
  <text start="755.26" dur="5.67">purchase on my clients credit card was</text>
  <text start="758.35" dur="5.04">to my firm and then they figured out</text>
  <text start="760.93" dur="4.41">that their attorneys couldn&amp;#39;t collect it</text>
  <text start="763.39" dur="5.1">was like this always this relationship</text>
  <text start="765.34" dur="4.65">always existed so they decided to try to</text>
  <text start="768.49" dur="2.73">stop me or scare me or whatever they</text>
  <text start="769.99" dur="2.67">they couldn&amp;#39;t stop me legally because I</text>
  <text start="771.22" dur="5.28">can I can write a book and I could you</text>
  <text start="772.66" dur="5.67">know sell forms so they sued my neighbor</text>
  <text start="776.5" dur="5.61">they figured out where I lived and they</text>
  <text start="778.33" dur="4.8">they suit my neighbor yeah and they knew</text>
  <text start="782.11" dur="2.7">they couldn&amp;#39;t sue me</text>
  <text start="783.13" dur="4.62">so they sued my neighbor to try to pull</text>
  <text start="784.81" dur="4.62">me in for discovery and that didn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="787.75" dur="3.15">anywhere yeah I was like a dead end for</text>
  <text start="789.43" dur="2.94">him so they got frustrated but they</text>
  <text start="790.9" dur="4.41">thought that scared me so all I do is</text>
  <text start="792.37" dur="4.53">write a new book and then I kept</text>
  <text start="795.31" dur="4.53">developing my procedures and that&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="796.9" dur="4.89">I came up with the idea of creating away</text>
  <text start="799.84" dur="5.07">age garnishment that would block wage</text>
  <text start="801.79" dur="5.76">garnishments so that&amp;#39;s how I am able to</text>
  <text start="804.91" dur="5.16">block wage garnishments so over all that</text>
  <text start="807.55" dur="4.08">time where I run into a situation where</text>
  <text start="810.07" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s ironic where someone&amp;#39;s got lots of</text>
  <text start="811.63" dur="4.52">day if I restructure them and I protect</text>
  <text start="814.96" dur="4.23">them against the collections process</text>
  <text start="816.15" dur="4.99">it&amp;#39;s almost the same thing that if I</text>
  <text start="819.19" dur="3.3">were to do to help somebody with a big</text>
  <text start="821.14" dur="2.61">windfall like if someone came to me and</text>
  <text start="822.49" dur="1.98">said I had two and half million dollars</text>
  <text start="823.75" dur="4.53">now what do I do</text>
  <text start="824.47" dur="5.07">I would use almost a similar strategy to</text>
  <text start="828.28" dur="3.69">help because there are certain types of</text>
  <text start="829.54" dur="4.17">risk there&amp;#39;s risk that your Fiat you</text>
  <text start="831.97" dur="2.73">know holdings in Fiat there&amp;#39;s risks to</text>
  <text start="833.71" dur="3.48">just keeping the money in your bank</text>
  <text start="834.7" dur="4.05">account there&amp;#39;s risk to there&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="837.19" dur="2.52">risk to buying real estate and all this</text>
  <text start="838.75" dur="2.91">sort of thing if you don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="839.71" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re doing so I write up a plan for</text>
  <text start="841.66" dur="4.05">people and some of the tools I use our</text>
  <text start="843.79" dur="3.39">companies some are trusts organizations</text>
  <text start="845.71" dur="4.56">like if I&amp;#39;m working with someone in</text>
  <text start="847.18" dur="4.95">California I&amp;#39;ll do a I have a special</text>
  <text start="850.27" dur="3.54">settlement trust where it changes the</text>
  <text start="852.13" dur="2.73">signature rights on the account and he</text>
  <text start="853.81" dur="2.94">doesn&amp;#39;t have to file anything with the</text>
  <text start="854.86" dur="4.89">state he just opens a new account with</text>
  <text start="856.75" dur="6.93">his trust agreement and even the IRS can</text>
  <text start="859.75" dur="6.63">take the money so very useful very neat</text>
  <text start="863.68" dur="4.68">yeah and one lady I was working with the</text>
  <text start="866.38" dur="5.13">other day she had to move money from</text>
  <text start="868.36" dur="6.18">Iran of all places now Iran sanctions</text>
  <text start="871.51" dur="4.41">and stuff so yeah a nice windfall was</text>
  <text start="874.54" dur="5.58">like an inheritance I think I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="875.92" dur="7.47">how much it was and it was in the Rio so</text>
  <text start="880.12" dur="5.04">she wanted to take it to New York so I</text>
  <text start="883.39" dur="4.02">said let&amp;#39;s not problem here&amp;#39;s what you</text>
  <text start="885.16" dur="3.51">do did I gave her like a three step is a</text>
  <text start="887.41" dur="3.36">little bit of work there was a low</text>
  <text start="888.67" dur="3.69">premium involved but she did it took</text>
  <text start="890.77" dur="3.66">about a week then she was able to move</text>
  <text start="892.36" dur="4.23">the money into New York very neat</text>
  <text start="894.43" dur="3.18">without going through the Fed wire</text>
  <text start="896.59" dur="4.62">system because that would have not been</text>
  <text start="897.61" dur="5.7">allowed okay so before anyone runs and</text>
  <text start="901.21" dur="3.72">tells em in their life that they heard</text>
  <text start="903.31" dur="3.33">something that&amp;#39;s difficult to believe on</text>
  <text start="904.93" dur="3.15">the destiny mesh channel because</text>

  <text start="1104.04" dur="5.76">pretty good track record you have more</text>
  <text start="1105.87" dur="5.64">cases than I even suspected yeah so very</text>
  <text start="1109.8" dur="3.18">neat so kind of getting back to the</text>
  <text start="1111.51" dur="3.87">crypto a little bit you you&amp;#39;ve developed</text>
  <text start="1112.98" dur="5.1">this this way of structuring things to</text>
  <text start="1115.38" dur="4.26">be able to move around in crypto and you</text>
  <text start="1118.08" dur="4.26">know right now one of the big headaches</text>
  <text start="1119.64" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s holding people back is one it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1122.34" dur="4.08">not really convenient anymore it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1123.87" dur="5.4">little more a little bit too complicated</text>
  <text start="1126.42" dur="5.42">and to every single thing that you do is</text>
  <text start="1129.27" dur="4.95">supposed to be some sort of attacks</text>
  <text start="1131.84" dur="5.29">portable interaction so even if you get</text>
  <text start="1134.22" dur="5.04">coffee or whatever I guess technically</text>
  <text start="1137.13" dur="3.39">if you just keep a ledger really well of</text>
  <text start="1139.26" dur="3.54">every single thing that you do with</text>
  <text start="1140.52" dur="4.89">crypto it would make sense but you know</text>
  <text start="1142.8" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s still a headache so does your</text>
  <text start="1145.41" dur="4.17">system help with that part of it as well</text>
  <text start="1147.09" dur="5.16">yes I do keep I do recommend it you keep</text>
  <text start="1149.58" dur="4.35">track of your holdings and however you</text>

  <text start="1156.84" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t need to do it for reporting</text>

  <text start="1160.71" dur="4.95">the IRS correctly defined a messed</text>

  <text start="1262.02" dur="5.13">financing in time alright so what you do</text>
  <text start="1264.27" dur="5.22">is you move your your holdings from your</text>
  <text start="1267.15" dur="3.87">wallet and coin base to a private wallet</text>
  <text start="1269.49" dur="2.97">let&amp;#39;s say exodus as an example I</text>
  <text start="1271.02" dur="4.61">wouldn&amp;#39;t use X&amp;#39;s but let&amp;#39;s just say it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1272.46" dur="5.88">exit or paper wallet whatever you can</text>
  <text start="1275.63" dur="4.57">anyway it is you should have you should</text>
  <text start="1278.34" dur="3.03">have an understanding at least a basic</text>
  <text start="1280.2" dur="3.09">understanding of how to use paper</text>
  <text start="1281.37" dur="4.23">wallets I use paper wallets and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1283.29" dur="4.889">not paper I just keep them in a file so</text>
  <text start="1285.6" dur="5.31">on the computer but yeah so you can go</text>
  <text start="1288.179" dur="4.021">from your private wallet now you want to</text>
  <text start="1290.91" dur="2.61">make sure that you have control the</text>
  <text start="1292.2" dur="2.67">private key so that&amp;#39;s why I say private</text>
  <text start="1293.52" dur="3.33">wallet you&amp;#39;re going from coin based in</text>
  <text start="1294.87" dur="5.19">to your let&amp;#39;s say Exodus now you have</text>
  <text start="1296.85" dur="6.51">control the private key you can then go</text>
  <text start="1300.06" dur="5.52">into an qualified escrow account and</text>
  <text start="1303.36" dur="4.11">then you can from that account you can</text>
  <text start="1305.58" dur="3.84">spend the money to the asset or whatever</text>
  <text start="1307.47" dur="4.14">else you want to do it or you can use a</text>
  <text start="1309.42" dur="5.759">qualified escrow account to sell your</text>
  <text start="1311.61" dur="5.1">crypto into cash into your LLC and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1315.179" dur="5.611">tax deferred you&amp;#39;re not going to get a</text>
  <text start="1316.71" dur="8.78">1099 your company well but you won&amp;#39;t so</text>
  <text start="1320.79" dur="7.17">how does that work you open escrow</text>
  <text start="1325.49" dur="3.85">identify the owner of the asset which is</text>
  <text start="1327.96" dur="3.78">your company</text>
  <text start="1329.34" dur="4.8">so so you go from coinbase to a private</text>
  <text start="1331.74" dur="4.91">key you tell the escrow agent the owner</text>
  <text start="1334.14" dur="5.87">of this private key is so-and-so company</text>
  <text start="1336.65" dur="5.83">the escrow contract is written and</text>
  <text start="1340.01" dur="4.3">hopefully you have a contract pending if</text>
  <text start="1342.48" dur="3.63">you don&amp;#39;t you can find one so you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1344.31" dur="3.33">opened escrow there&amp;#39;s a seller out there</text>
  <text start="1346.11" dur="3.18">waiting for his money and maybe he wants</text>
  <text start="1347.64" dur="3.39">dollars or maybe he wants gold I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1349.29" dur="3.48">know the escrow agent will figure that</text>
  <text start="1351.03" dur="3.12">out the escrow agent will convert the</text>
  <text start="1352.77" dur="3.84">funds however so you can go from Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="1354.15" dur="5.79">into your asset and the seller gets his</text>
  <text start="1356.61" dur="4.98">dollars if he wants that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s nice</text>
  <text start="1359.94" dur="6.21">and you&amp;#39;ll pay a small premium usually</text>
  <text start="1361.59" dur="6.24">it&amp;#39;s 1% industry standard but in terms</text>
  <text start="1366.15" dur="3.72">of like reporting requirements and</text>
  <text start="1367.83" dur="4.14">everything else because you know if</text>

  <text start="1656.19" dur="3.03">because IRS may audit you someday and</text>

  <text start="1659.22" dur="3.659">imputed income tax you didn&amp;#39;t tell us</text>
  <text start="1660.6" dur="4.5">about this oh let&amp;#39;s look at that right</text>
  <text start="1662.879" dur="3.601">we&amp;#39;re just your accounting correctly so</text>
  <text start="1665.1" dur="3.799">any personal gain you get out of that</text>
  <text start="1666.48" dur="5.429">money from the LLC you should report it</text>
  <text start="1668.899" dur="4.541">yeah why I don&amp;#39;t know about anyone else</text>
  <text start="1671.909" dur="3.24">but if there&amp;#39;s a way to do that for me I</text>
  <text start="1673.44" dur="3.26">would live on pennies and and just</text>
  <text start="1675.149" dur="4.98">reinvest everything</text>
  <text start="1676.7" dur="6.25">exactly right right what an advantage</text>
  <text start="1680.129" dur="3.99">over the typical look what you can do I</text>
  <text start="1682.95" dur="3.03">mean you can take a million-dollar</text>
  <text start="1684.119" dur="3.15">principle and take a million dollars and</text>
  <text start="1685.98" dur="2.579">put it your next asset instead of</text>
  <text start="1687.269" dur="3.571">putting six hundred thousand dollars in</text>
  <text start="1688.559" dur="4.55">your next asset I mean you can probably</text>
  <text start="1690.84" dur="4.469">if you had a seat cork you can probably</text>
  <text start="1693.109" dur="3.101">with the right accounting it might cost</text>
  <text start="1695.309" dur="2.31">you twenty grand</text>
  <text start="1696.21" dur="4.079">but you might be able to get like a</text>
  <text start="1697.619" dur="3.81">ninety five percent you know tax break</text>
  <text start="1700.289" dur="2.88">or whatever if you have the right</text>
  <text start="1701.429" dur="3.781">situation if you have the right type of</text>
  <text start="1703.169" dur="3.541">accounting but it&amp;#39;s so simple like</text>
  <text start="1705.21" dur="4.559">that&amp;#39;s what I like to recommend LLC</text>
  <text start="1706.71" dur="4.77">because it&amp;#39;s simple to use it&amp;#39;s just I</text>
  <text start="1709.769" dur="3.061">don&amp;#39;t need I don&amp;#39;t need a hundred</text>
  <text start="1711.48" dur="1.769">thousand dollars in capital to make it</text>
  <text start="1712.83" dur="2.37">work</text>
  <text start="1713.249" dur="3.691">it is cash basis accounting for most of</text>
  <text start="1715.2" dur="3.63">us as some of us will start getting into</text>
  <text start="1716.94" dur="3.329">other types of accounting it depends on</text>
  <text start="1718.83" dur="3.39">what you&amp;#39;re gonna do with the money and</text>
  <text start="1720.269" dur="2.941">you&amp;#39;ll learn about that I mean you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1722.22" dur="3.329">have an accountant and they&amp;#39;ll do it</text>
  <text start="1723.21" dur="4.049">I&amp;#39;ll do the right thing but to keep it</text>
  <text start="1725.549" dur="2.471">simple you know just pass it through and</text>
  <text start="1727.259" dur="2.621">then when you get your</text>
  <text start="1728.02" dur="3.84">set just manage it properly in a bad</text>
  <text start="1729.88" dur="4.23">asset needs to file returns well then so</text>
  <text start="1731.86" dur="6.03">be it that&amp;#39;s what you want to do yeah</text>
  <text start="1734.11" dur="6.66">yeah the other question I get is on</text>
  <text start="1737.89" dur="4.29">people where they have boy tell me I</text>
  <text start="1740.77" dur="3.66">mean what&amp;#39;s your experience on this I</text>
  <text start="1742.18" dur="7.62">mean what about people talking about</text>
  <text start="1744.43" dur="7.5">taxes between Kryptos yeah I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1749.8" dur="3.9">I mean I&amp;#39;m kind of just a bi and huddle</text>
  <text start="1751.93" dur="3.96">you know I&amp;#39;m huddling long term I I</text>
  <text start="1753.7" dur="3.99">haven&amp;#39;t really sold any of my Bitcoin I</text>
  <text start="1755.89" dur="4.53">figure I&amp;#39;ll deal with the tax</text>
  <text start="1757.69" dur="5.25">implications if and when yeah what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1760.42" dur="4.17">playing it safe well so but what if what</text>
  <text start="1762.94" dur="3.18">if you go from Bitcoin to light coin and</text>
  <text start="1764.59" dur="3.75">light chling goes way up against Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="1766.12" dur="4.56">isn&amp;#39;t that a game isn&amp;#39;t that taxable</text>
  <text start="1768.34" dur="4.53">yeah it&amp;#39;s a very confusing situation if</text>
  <text start="1770.68" dur="3.93">you try to do the IRS part of it yeah</text>
  <text start="1772.87" dur="4.02">well just ask this question if this tax</text>
  <text start="1774.61" dur="4.92">well let&amp;#39;s assume it is so which taxing</text>
  <text start="1776.89" dur="5.13">statute applies where&amp;#39;s the tax apply</text>
  <text start="1779.53" dur="4.68">what statute says that transaction is</text>
  <text start="1782.02" dur="4.77">taxable because the tax only applies to</text>
  <text start="1784.21" dur="5.52">a type of transaction there has to be a</text>
  <text start="1786.79" dur="5.1">type kind or class of tax and that has</text>
  <text start="1789.73" dur="4.2">to be described in a statute and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1791.89" dur="4.41">only collectible under an implementing</text>
  <text start="1793.93" dur="4.68">regulation so you&amp;#39;ve got this the</text>
  <text start="1796.3" dur="3.57">Congress writes a law then they organize</text>
  <text start="1798.61" dur="2.61">it in statutes they number everything</text>
  <text start="1799.87" dur="3.36">everybody can look that stuff up and</text>
  <text start="1801.22" dur="4.23">then the agency is collecting the tax</text>
  <text start="1803.23" dur="3.84">has to write regulations that are</text>
  <text start="1805.45" dur="3.18">similar to the statutes and the</text>
  <text start="1807.07" dur="3.87">regulations are actually more specific</text>
  <text start="1808.63" dur="4.17">and it&amp;#39;ll tell you the type kind of</text>
  <text start="1810.94" dur="4.16">class of tax so I would love to see a</text>
  <text start="1812.8" dur="6">regulation and a statute that says</text>
  <text start="1815.1" dur="5.95">litecoin and Bitcoin transactions is a</text>
  <text start="1818.8" dur="5.31">type of tax and here it is in this</text>
  <text start="1821.05" dur="4.74">section you know I this this gives me</text>
  <text start="1824.11" dur="3.57">this strikes me as the kind of thing</text>
  <text start="1825.79" dur="3.6">that works right now but they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1827.68" dur="3.51">find a way to make an example of</text>
  <text start="1829.39" dur="4.41">everyone in this face at some point I</text>
  <text start="1831.19" dur="4.2">think that&amp;#39;s coming and I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="1833.8" dur="3.12">you can tack strip tows just like I</text>
  <text start="1835.39" dur="2.91">don&amp;#39;t know how you could tax gold unless</text>
  <text start="1836.92" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;re gonna make the holder of the gold</text>
  <text start="1838.3" dur="4.23">pay you a portion of this gold okay</text>
  <text start="1841.15" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s why they do in dollars</text>
  <text start="1842.53" dur="2.91">right so I don&amp;#39;t know how like it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1844.18" dur="3.06">I explained before I don&amp;#39;t know how you</text>
  <text start="1845.44" dur="4.02">can do it in this framework but like I</text>
  <text start="1847.24" dur="4.62">agree with you it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what I</text>
  <text start="1849.46" dur="3.81">think because they they&amp;#39;ll want a piece</text>
  <text start="1851.86" dur="3.15">of it somehow I mean maybe it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1853.27" dur="3.06">at the exchanges right if you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1855.01" dur="2.37">use an exchange maybe there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="1856.33" dur="3.6">something going on there</text>
  <text start="1857.38" dur="3.45">so I mean you gotta deal with it when</text>
  <text start="1859.93" dur="3.39">that happens but in the me</text>
  <text start="1860.83" dur="4.5">time there&amp;#39;s no tax between cryptos so</text>
  <text start="1863.32" dur="3.03">people have to understand this this is</text>
  <text start="1865.33" dur="2.91">what&amp;#39;s important to understand when</text>
  <text start="1866.35" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re dealing with an exchange the</text>
  <text start="1868.24" dur="3.83">exchange owns the private key this is</text>
  <text start="1870.25" dur="3.99">not something you control which is fine</text>
  <text start="1872.07" dur="4.359">it&amp;#39;s easy for you to access your account</text>
  <text start="1874.24" dur="4.38">but because the exchange owns the</text>
  <text start="1876.429" dur="3.99">private key and you can log in and then</text>
  <text start="1878.62" dur="4.35">you can move the money that means the</text>
  <text start="1880.419" dur="5.25">exchange owes you the money so it means</text>
  <text start="1882.97" dur="5.67">the account holder is the beneficiary of</text>
  <text start="1885.669" dur="6.36">that transaction because he doesn&amp;#39;t own</text>
  <text start="1888.64" dur="5.19">it so it&amp;#39;s not taxable to himself maybe</text>
  <text start="1892.029" dur="3.601">it&amp;#39;s tax called a coin base that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1893.83" dur="3.66">really how it works but coin base is</text>
  <text start="1895.63" dur="4.889">literally the owner of the money that</text>
  <text start="1897.49" dur="4.62">you put in the coin base well because</text>
  <text start="1900.519" dur="3.03">you&amp;#39;re contributing the money whether</text>
  <text start="1902.11" dur="3.539">it&amp;#39;s coming from dollars or whatever or</text>
  <text start="1903.549" dur="2.701">another crypto you&amp;#39;re also the Grand</text>
  <text start="1905.649" dur="1.951">Tour</text>
  <text start="1906.25" dur="5.399">so you actually have a trust</text>
  <text start="1907.6" dur="6.419">relationship with the exchanges because</text>
  <text start="1911.649" dur="5.221">the exchange owns the money and owes you</text>
  <text start="1914.019" dur="4.741">the money and you put the value in that</text>
  <text start="1916.87" dur="3.33">makes you the beneficiary and the Grand</text>
  <text start="1918.76" dur="5.58">Tour and it makes the exchange the</text>
  <text start="1920.2" dur="5.31">trustee supposed to identify that in a</text>
  <text start="1924.34" dur="3.719">written instrument is why I use the</text>
  <text start="1925.51" dur="4.95">blockchain trust you can show on record</text>
  <text start="1928.059" dur="4.321">that even if there is a tax on the</text>
  <text start="1930.46" dur="3.839">ownership it&amp;#39;s not your tax</text>
  <text start="1932.38" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s coin basis tax and it doesn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="1934.299" dur="4.291">from your money that&amp;#39;s great yeah so I</text>
  <text start="1937.6" dur="2.039">don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re gonna impose that</text>
  <text start="1938.59" dur="3.54">right now I think there&amp;#39;s gonna be some</text>
  <text start="1939.639" dur="5.431">uh something there&amp;#39;d have to be like um</text>
  <text start="1942.13" dur="4.889">a Fed coin type of thing and then they</text>
  <text start="1945.07" dur="3.3">have to force you to use fed coin for</text>
  <text start="1947.019" dur="3.991">some things and then they could then</text>
  <text start="1948.37" dur="4.2">make you do it that way yeah and then</text>
  <text start="1951.01" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;ll be the end of all the private</text>
  <text start="1952.57" dur="5.19">transactions Craigslist everything well</text>
  <text start="1955.36" dur="3.419">as far as we see it now I mean I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1957.76" dur="3.259">think people going to stop it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1958.779" dur="6.541">like prohibition how&amp;#39;d that work out for</text>
  <text start="1961.019" dur="5.681">okay yeah so I imagine people will just</text>
  <text start="1965.32" dur="3.12">say well I&amp;#39;m just going to start using a</text>

  <text start="2243.67" dur="2.73">this well there&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="2245.44" dur="2.52">question there are a couple things I</text>
  <text start="2246.4" dur="3.03">recommended people want to just get</text>
  <text start="2247.96" dur="2.67">started first of all make a list of</text>
  <text start="2249.43" dur="3">where you&amp;#39;ve been disclosing your</text>
  <text start="2250.63" dur="4.38">private information and I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="2252.43" dur="4.78">about your name your social security</text>
  <text start="2255.01" dur="4.24">number date of birth</text>
  <text start="2257.21" dur="3.36">home address and look at how you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2259.25" dur="4.41">receiving your mail you got your name</text>
  <text start="2260.57" dur="5.34">and your home address usually just make</text>
  <text start="2263.66" dur="4.98">a list of all this this this is all risk</text>
  <text start="2265.91" dur="3.84">to your privacy you can change all of</text>
  <text start="2268.64" dur="4.38">that</text>
  <text start="2269.75" dur="5.46">the next thing I would look at is how</text>
  <text start="2273.02" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;m using my money is my money are</text>
  <text start="2275.21" dur="5.4">always associated with my name and if it</text>
  <text start="2277.64" dur="4.65">is consider using a structure a third</text>
  <text start="2280.61" dur="3.84">party a company a trust or something</text>
  <text start="2282.29" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s separate so you control the use</text>
  <text start="2284.45" dur="5.01">of the money and you don&amp;#39;t own it that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2287.24" dur="5.1">a big thing that&amp;#39;s most of this most of</text>
  <text start="2289.46" dur="4.77">privacy most of your security one other</text>
  <text start="2292.34" dur="3.45">thing I recommend is like for example on</text>
  <text start="2294.23" dur="3.36">your driver&amp;#39;s license is your home</text>
  <text start="2295.79" dur="4.32">address and your driver&amp;#39;s license is</text>
  <text start="2297.59" dur="5.31">your home address in your GPS system and</text>
  <text start="2300.11" dur="3.96">your map fine during a car do you really</text>
  <text start="2302.9" dur="2.88">need a map liner to your home address</text>
  <text start="2304.07" dur="3">and they come on maybe you need it to</text>
  <text start="2305.78" dur="3.93">your neighborhood but you don&amp;#39;t need it</text>
  <text start="2307.07" dur="3.51">to your home if someone steals your car</text>
  <text start="2309.71" dur="4.59">you let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="2310.58" dur="5.4">b.p beep home show up at your house you</text>
  <text start="2314.3" dur="2.91">know you can do whatever or if he steals</text>
  <text start="2315.98" dur="2.49">your wallet you get your driver&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2317.21" dur="3.72">license and now he&amp;#39;s got your home</text>
  <text start="2318.47" dur="3.75">address so I know the statutes probably</text>
  <text start="2320.93" dur="3.24">say you got to have your home address</text>
  <text start="2322.22" dur="4.11">and the cops always ask you is it your</text>
  <text start="2324.17" dur="4.68">home address now in mine mine is</text>
  <text start="2326.33" dur="4.2">literally a mailbox in another County</text>
  <text start="2328.85" dur="3.48">and I will tell them with a straight</text>
  <text start="2330.53" dur="3.99">face yeah that&amp;#39;s my home address I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2332.33" dur="3.75">care because my safety and security of</text>
  <text start="2334.52" dur="4.05">my family safety and securities depend</text>
  <text start="2336.08" dur="4.38">on me not them of course and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="2338.57" dur="3.36">examples just I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="2340.46" dur="2.82">you follow the politics side of things</text>
  <text start="2341.93" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;ve seen examples where the police</text>
  <text start="2343.28" dur="4.17">will work with an Tifa to actually let</text>
  <text start="2345.83" dur="3.75">the violence happen things like this we</text>
  <text start="2347.45" dur="4.2">know that they even at the IRS level are</text>
  <text start="2349.58" dur="4.17">willing to target people for their views</text>
  <text start="2351.65" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s something wrong with that so I</text>
  <text start="2353.75" dur="2.58">would just look at that look at all the</text>
  <text start="2355.16" dur="2.67">places I&amp;#39;m disclosing it and then</text>
  <text start="2356.33" dur="3.54">consider there&amp;#39;s a couple things that</text>
  <text start="2357.83" dur="5.4">people don&amp;#39;t know you&amp;#39;re not required to</text>
  <text start="2359.87" dur="5.1">give somebody your SSN I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="2363.23" dur="4.05">you care to you know follow up with that</text>
  <text start="2364.97" dur="4.5">like actually you know exercise that but</text>
  <text start="2367.28" dur="4.29">like I just need all zeros when someone</text>
  <text start="2369.47" dur="3.42">asks me especially like with the</text>
  <text start="2371.57" dur="3.33">doctor&amp;#39;s office I&amp;#39;m gonna be the one</text>
  <text start="2372.89" dur="3.48">paying the doctor right so definitely</text>
  <text start="2374.9" dur="4.41">why should I give up my essence and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2376.37" dur="5.1">like your EIN right yeah that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2379.31" dur="3.87">trying to do that with a passport soon</text>
  <text start="2381.47" dur="4.02">actually I&amp;#39;m getting my passport for the</text>
  <text start="2383.18" dur="6.31">first time and I don&amp;#39;t know how to put</text>
  <text start="2385.49" dur="6.25">all zeros on it but like your affidavit</text>
  <text start="2389.49" dur="4.68">because I as well because I&amp;#39;m renewing</text>
  <text start="2391.74" dur="4.77">minds there&amp;#39;s a couple ways I can go and</text>
  <text start="2394.17" dur="4.439">in the course of doing that I mean I</text>
  <text start="2396.51" dur="5.01">think what they want you to do is fill</text>
  <text start="2398.609" dur="5.131">out an affidavit and you&amp;#39;re not required</text>
  <text start="2401.52" dur="3.87">to fill out more of a form than what</text>
  <text start="2403.74" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re given like you&amp;#39;re the post office</text>
  <text start="2405.39" dur="4.44">you the passport form that&amp;#39;s the form</text>
  <text start="2407.43" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s no section on there to certify</text>
  <text start="2409.83" dur="4.259">that you don&amp;#39;t have or don&amp;#39;t want to use</text>
  <text start="2411.18" dur="4.38">an SSN and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s illegal to ask or</text>
  <text start="2414.089" dur="3.421">compel someone to produce it so I think</text>
  <text start="2415.56" dur="5.22">what&amp;#39;s gonna happen is in the near</text>
  <text start="2417.51" dur="5.099">future someone&amp;#39;s gonna sue and and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2420.78" dur="4.05">gonna be upheld and they&amp;#39;ll have to stop</text>
  <text start="2422.609" dur="4.021">that policy because it&amp;#39;s a policy the</text>
  <text start="2424.83" dur="5.07">disclosure requirement on the passport</text>
  <text start="2426.63" dur="5.79">for an SSN came into being about a year</text>
  <text start="2429.9" dur="6.719">ago because Obama had passed this law</text>

  <text start="2521.28" dur="3.989">the IRS gets around it somehow it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2523.109" dur="4.65">suppose dance but a payor is supposed to</text>

  <text start="2547.529" dur="4.08">shuts down I&amp;#39;m not a dumb guy but when I</text>
  <text start="2549.21" dur="4.889">when it comes to taxation or these these</text>
  <text start="2551.609" dur="4.26">bureaucratic guys I don&amp;#39;t want to deal</text>

  <text start="2555.869" dur="4.081">always like angry and and and</text>
  <text start="2558.18" dur="3.569">dark-minded people and they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="2559.95" dur="3.78">trying to exercise their power over you</text>
  <text start="2561.749" dur="4.77">and I just makes you feel small to be</text>

  <text start="2566.519" dur="3.421">things in place to help people while can</text>
  <text start="2568.319" dur="4.561">you talk about that for a second right</text>
  <text start="2569.94" dur="6.21">specifically like on the privacy for</text>
  <text start="2572.88" dur="5.52">crypto yeah okay yeah I definitely use a</text>
  <text start="2576.15" dur="4.98">company a limited liability company I do</text>
  <text start="2578.4" dur="4.8">I have a blockchain tax immunity trust</text>
  <text start="2581.13" dur="4.83">so the trust is a document that</text>
  <text start="2583.2" dur="4.349">identifies the trust relationship so</text>
  <text start="2585.96" dur="4.319">there&amp;#39;s no tax consequence in between</text>
  <text start="2587.549" dur="4.53">transactions so I always recommend those</text>
  <text start="2590.279" dur="3.151">two things and then if you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2592.079" dur="5.881">manage it</text>
  <text start="2593.43" dur="7.05">I recommend security like encryption so</text>
  <text start="2597.96" dur="5.099">either have a dedicated device or some</text>
  <text start="2600.48" dur="5.069">sort of hard wallet to manage your</text>
  <text start="2603.059" dur="4.95">Kryptos that way like I like to have</text>
  <text start="2605.549" dur="4.141">something I use this little um this this</text>
  <text start="2608.009" dur="3.181">item that&amp;#39;s on my website where you can</text>
  <text start="2609.69" dur="4.589">it&amp;#39;s a whole computer so I plug it into</text>
  <text start="2611.19" dur="4.47">a monitor and then I can I can manage</text>
  <text start="2614.279" dur="2.52">all my wallet I can install wallets on</text>
  <text start="2615.66" dur="2.909">there I can put my keys on there and</text>
  <text start="2616.799" dur="2.75">then I can unplug it and put it in my</text>
  <text start="2618.569" dur="3.54">vault</text>
  <text start="2619.549" dur="6.55">so that gives by the sea and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2622.109" dur="6.271">really neat mm-hmm okay and and and</text>
  <text start="2626.099" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s really interesting because as</text>
  <text start="2628.38" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;ve talked about already and as I talk</text>
  <text start="2630.059" dur="4.68">about in the show often crypto is a big</text>
  <text start="2633.18" dur="3.119">part of the future I think there&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2634.739" dur="3.151">to be a place for gold and silver and I</text>
  <text start="2636.299" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t think they have to be enemies like</text>
  <text start="2637.89" dur="3.84">a lot of the gold silver types feel</text>
  <text start="2639.779" dur="3.84">threatened by crypto as I think and and</text>
  <text start="2641.73" dur="3.779">that&amp;#39;s not necessarily you know you</text>
  <text start="2643.619" dur="5.88">still gotta buy and sell online so</text>
  <text start="2645.509" dur="5.52">there&amp;#39;s always a place for both well</text>
  <text start="2649.499" dur="3.421">yeah I mean gold and silver always gonna</text>
  <text start="2651.029" dur="4.29">be part of our money supply but III</text>
  <text start="2652.92" dur="3.67">agree with you I think kryptos are the</text>
  <text start="2655.319" dur="3.971">future</text>
  <text start="2656.59" dur="4.26">yes necessarily because I think it</text>
  <text start="2659.29" dur="3.12">sounds kind of futuristic but I think</text>
  <text start="2660.85" dur="5.31">we&amp;#39;re gonna need to be able to buy and</text>
  <text start="2662.41" dur="5.85">sell outside of let&amp;#39;s say the orbit of</text>
  <text start="2666.16" dur="4.65">the earth I think we&amp;#39;re gonna be on and</text>
  <text start="2668.26" dur="4.62">Mars in the near future and yeah sure</text>
  <text start="2670.81" dur="3.72">yeah I think Kripke&amp;#39;s will serve that</text>
  <text start="2672.88" dur="3.81">purpose and also security too I mean</text>
  <text start="2674.53" dur="5.46">imagine putting your whole city&amp;#39;s budget</text>
  <text start="2676.69" dur="5.52">on the blockchain yeah you can see</text>
  <text start="2679.99" dur="5.76">instantaneous transactions yeah you</text>
  <text start="2682.21" dur="4.89">would have increased if you went with</text>
  <text start="2685.75" dur="2.67">Bitcoin something that&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="2687.1" dur="3.35">transparent you can see every</text>
  <text start="2688.42" dur="3.84">transaction you would have a lot more</text>
  <text start="2690.45" dur="3.28">transparency at the governmental level</text>
  <text start="2692.26" dur="4.62">although it&amp;#39;d be great to just get rid</text>
  <text start="2693.73" dur="5.88">of them okay scale them down and if they</text>
  <text start="2696.88" dur="5.22">exist still then we should write bright</text>
  <text start="2699.61" dur="4.32">laws imposing these obligations on them</text>
  <text start="2702.1" dur="4.08">using Kryptos make them make their own</text>
  <text start="2703.93" dur="3.69">crypto or use an existing crypto and</text>
  <text start="2706.18" dur="4.26">make them put their transactions in the</text>
  <text start="2707.62" dur="5.97">blockchain so like just like um taking</text>
  <text start="2710.44" dur="5.85">bids on a project a public project has</text>
  <text start="2713.59" dur="4.23">to be public well so it is the budget it</text>
  <text start="2716.29" dur="2.85">should be on the blockchain I mean you</text>
  <text start="2717.82" dur="2.97">can get the budget but it should be</text>
  <text start="2719.14" dur="3.12">available so you can just in one second</text>
  <text start="2720.79" dur="2.28">like you can look at the weather you</text>
  <text start="2722.26" dur="2.73">should be able to go and look at your</text>
  <text start="2723.07" dur="4.71">County&amp;#39;s budget and see what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2724.99" dur="4.17">doing on the road work right mm-hmm so</text>
  <text start="2727.78" dur="2.64">yeah but I think that&amp;#39;s coming and I</text>
  <text start="2729.16" dur="3">think people will figure that stuff out</text>
  <text start="2730.42" dur="3.99">but if you want to if you want some</text>
  <text start="2732.16" dur="3.72">privacy mean really a third party like a</text>
  <text start="2734.41" dur="3.39">nail Elsi or something like that as a</text>
  <text start="2735.88" dur="3.93">way to go and then look at where your</text>
  <text start="2737.8" dur="4.38">risks are in disclosing your personal</text>
  <text start="2739.81" dur="4.83">information and realize that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2742.18" dur="5.76">have to give someone your SSN although I</text>
  <text start="2744.64" dur="6.48">mean like when I do a bank account I</text>
  <text start="2747.94" dur="5.4">don&amp;#39;t use an SSN so I this takes there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2751.12" dur="4.38">levels of sophistication so you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2753.34" dur="3.81">even need an SSN on a credit file you</text>
  <text start="2755.5" dur="3.87">can I have credit file with no SSN on</text>
  <text start="2757.15" dur="5.16">there so there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that</text>
  <text start="2759.37" dur="5.31">people are aware of but the keeping it</text>
  <text start="2762.31" dur="3.99">simple I mean and for security purposes</text>
  <text start="2764.68" dur="3.12">it makes sense to receive your mail at a</text>
  <text start="2766.3" dur="3.06">different location like a mailbox and</text>
  <text start="2767.8" dur="3.84">yeah it cost maybe a few bucks a month</text>
  <text start="2769.36" dur="3.72">if use appeal box or something and then</text>
  <text start="2771.64" dur="2.97">if you&amp;#39;re gonna receive mail at your</text>
  <text start="2773.08" dur="2.97">house like if I&amp;#39;m gonna get a package I</text>
  <text start="2774.61" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t want to go to my box I would</text>
  <text start="2776.05" dur="4.73">rather have it come here right so I</text>
  <text start="2778.33" dur="4.23">haven&amp;#39;t sent like to a fictitious name</text>
  <text start="2780.78" dur="3.85">it&amp;#39;s always gonna be delivered</text>
  <text start="2782.56" dur="3.9">fictitious name now sometimes you have a</text>
  <text start="2784.63" dur="3.27">little bit of difficulty so maybe you</text>
  <text start="2786.46" dur="3.84">want to set that up in advance but the</text>
  <text start="2787.9" dur="2.67">whole idea is receive your mail as your</text>
  <text start="2790.3" dur="1.32">ad</text>
  <text start="2790.57" dur="4.17">where you live in a fictitious name</text>
