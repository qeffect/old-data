  <text start="2054.23" dur="4.32">Oh Judge Napolitano was that he was a</text>
  <text start="2056.39" dur="4.08">judge no no no but he writes articles a</text>
  <text start="2058.55" dur="3.87">lot but anyway I&amp;#39;ll think of it he kind</text>
  <text start="2060.47" dur="3.81">of he commissioned I liked Judge</text>
  <text start="2062.42" dur="4.05">Napolitano I mean he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s more of a</text>
  <text start="2064.28" dur="4.44">voluntary the most I mean he says I love</text>
  <text start="2066.47" dur="4.89">here&amp;#39;s my philosophy but he did kind of</text>
  <text start="2068.72" dur="6.69">come out recently against Trump in a way</text>
  <text start="2071.36" dur="5.61">with the the court case about Whitaker</text>
  <text start="2075.41" dur="3.15">being established he said he was</text>
  <text start="2076.97" dur="3.6">disappointed or something that the DOJ</text>
  <text start="2078.56" dur="5.25">had had confirmed Whitaker could do that</text>
  <text start="2080.57" dur="5.22">so I thought that&amp;#39;s not good Oh Andy</text>
  <text start="2083.81" dur="4.02">McCarthy Andy McCarthy that&amp;#39;s yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="2085.79" dur="4.17">yeah Andy&amp;#39;s on the list so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2087.83" dur="4.08">Whitaker staying in of course they give</text>
  <text start="2089.96" dur="3.93">him the option you know he&amp;#39;s on the list</text>
  <text start="2091.91" dur="7.47">because he&amp;#39;s in and but I really think</text>
  <text start="2093.89" dur="8.33">it&amp;#39;s gonna be galley but McCarthy&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="2099.38" dur="5.19">the list as well I heard all right so</text>
  <text start="2102.22" dur="4.12">let&amp;#39;s talk about the unsealed</text>
  <text start="2104.57" dur="5.82">indictments that you saw the list that</text>
  <text start="2106.34" dur="6.42">came out and that&amp;#39;s kind of a good start</text>
  <text start="2110.39" dur="5.88">well we talked about it briefly before</text>
  <text start="2112.76" dur="5.1">but you know that list of crimes also</text>
  <text start="2116.27" dur="3.21">and I wanted to touch on this before we</text>
  <text start="2117.86" dur="3.66">moved on that list of crimes involved a</text>
  <text start="2119.48" dur="4.23">lot of things that would make sense in a</text>
  <text start="2121.52" dur="5.27">political setting you know people think</text>
  <text start="2123.71" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s Isis or not Isis I ms-13</text>
  <text start="2126.79" dur="4.06">or maybe just people illegal</text>
  <text start="2129.62" dur="3.78">immigrations and stuff but there was</text>
  <text start="2130.85" dur="3.77">like bribery of officials there was the</text>
  <text start="2133.4" dur="3.66">human trafficking Child Exploitation</text>
  <text start="2134.62" dur="3.34">sexually things like that some of the</text>
  <text start="2137.06" dur="2.73">things that people</text>
  <text start="2137.96" dur="5.04">won&amp;#39;t even believe now it&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="2139.79" dur="4.38">come out as hard evidence on paper so I</text>
  <text start="2143" dur="2.339">mean I know we talked about it before</text>
  <text start="2144.17" dur="2.6">but I wanted to mention those things</text>
  <text start="2145.339" dur="6.661">because I kind of forgotten about it</text>
  <text start="2146.77" dur="7.63">before and I guess it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;ve you Dustin</text>
  <text start="2152" dur="5.339">s of WikiLeaks I I do view this as</text>
  <text start="2154.4" dur="4.35">Julian Assange drip strategy yeah and I</text>
  <text start="2157.339" dur="3.481">think they&amp;#39;ve employed it well this</text>
  <text start="2158.75" dur="4.17">whole year the queue team and POTUS but</text>
  <text start="2160.82" dur="4.89">I think this is just looking micro on a</text>
  <text start="2162.92" dur="4.35">micro level that that&amp;#39;s the way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2165.71" dur="4.77">gonna handle this because just imagine</text>
  <text start="2167.27" dur="5.37">that they could do out a hundred you</text>
  <text start="2170.48" dur="3.72">know five hundred generic you know what</text>
  <text start="2172.64" dur="4.29">I mean just building people up and and</text>
  <text start="2174.2" dur="4.139">then they start unsealing the names from</text>
  <text start="2176.93" dur="3.3">the first batch do you know what I mean</text>
  <text start="2178.339" dur="4.051">it&amp;#39;s a progressive thing and I that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2180.23" dur="4.859">why I viewed the initial batch I thought</text>
  <text start="2182.39" dur="6.24">right off the bat this is ala WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="2185.089" dur="5.131">and it&amp;#39;s a crescendo because there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="2188.63" dur="4.86">much it obviously can&amp;#39;t go out in one</text>
  <text start="2190.22" dur="5.61">day it probably killed people lose</text>
  <text start="2193.49" dur="4.29">interest before it was finished it would</text>
  <text start="2195.83" dur="4.2">be so overwhelming that you know who can</text>
  <text start="2197.78" dur="3.99">go through such a thing and and I think</text>
  <text start="2200.03" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s the strategy it looks like to me</text>
  <text start="2201.77" dur="3.839">if I&amp;#39;d make an early guest because again</text>
  <text start="2203.72" dur="4.44">you know this stuff is just an I agree</text>
  <text start="2205.609" dur="6.601">with you it&amp;#39;s some of its focused but</text>
  <text start="2208.16" dur="7.56">but some of it is far afield you know as</text>
  <text start="2212.21" dur="5.7">far as the the categories and again Rico</text>
  <text start="2215.72" dur="3.66">I&amp;#39;ve said this all along to Rico is</text>
  <text start="2217.91" dur="3.9">going to be the glue that binds all</text>
  <text start="2219.38" dur="3.87">these criminals together the RICO</text>
  <text start="2221.81" dur="4.5">umbrella is going to take care of</text>
  <text start="2223.25" dur="5.73">statutes limitations and encompass</text>
  <text start="2226.31" dur="4.95">everybody as far as your blanket net so</text>
  <text start="2228.98" dur="4.17">a lot of these things these may be</text>
  <text start="2231.26" dur="3.69">foundational that they&amp;#39;ll use for the</text>
  <text start="2233.15" dur="3.66">big people for the RICO later so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2234.95" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s another way that they stack these</text>
  <text start="2236.81" dur="5.88">you know release these indictments and</text>
  <text start="2240.02" dur="4.23">and now they&amp;#39;re also releasing some of</text>
  <text start="2242.69" dur="4.11">the stuff that was sealed about Benghazi</text>
  <text start="2244.25" dur="4.17">with Hillary there she&amp;#39;s hashed she has</text>
  <text start="2246.8" dur="4.049">to go back and testify under oath about</text>
  <text start="2248.42" dur="4.8">her emails in Benghazi now but I think</text>
  <text start="2250.849" dur="4.561">the questions the way that they had</text>
  <text start="2253.22" dur="4.26">those to do it was the two questions and</text>
  <text start="2255.41" dur="4.709">their killer questions I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2257.48" dur="4.47">hard to get out of I mean I I heard you</text>
  <text start="2260.119" dur="4.071">know I read that primarily that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2261.95" dur="6.51">gonna focus on two main questions and</text>
  <text start="2264.19" dur="5.44">yeah and and she cannot explain herself</text>
  <text start="2268.46" dur="2.57">out of it you know what I mean unless</text>
  <text start="2269.63" dur="5.45">it&amp;#39;s a total memory</text>
  <text start="2271.03" dur="6.75">laughs well get out as having no memory</text>
  <text start="2275.08" dur="4.5">of even her own name flat last time she</text>
  <text start="2277.78" dur="3.42">basically said I have no memory I have</text>
  <text start="2279.58" dur="3.81">no memory about like dozens of questions</text>
  <text start="2281.2" dur="2.61">I think it was and then she has six</text>
  <text start="2283.39" dur="4.56">please</text>
  <text start="2283.81" dur="6.33">60 sometime I did article 65 63 and</text>
  <text start="2287.95" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s Lewis stroszek was he appear</text>
  <text start="2290.14" dur="4.98">stroszek was a questioner and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2292.09" dur="5.76">Cheryl Mills and sidon and and Heather</text>
  <text start="2295.12" dur="4.44">savers and just long just in case yeah</text>
  <text start="2297.85" dur="3.21">and and people have also I want you</text>
  <text start="2299.56" dur="3.33">mentioned WikiLeaks people have been</text>
  <text start="2301.06" dur="3.06">thinking Assange has a part I think he</text>
  <text start="2302.89" dur="3.15">has a part to play and I know many</text>
  <text start="2304.12" dur="3.51">others share that thought and then</text>
  <text start="2306.04" dur="3.09">recently they&amp;#39;re trying to say once</text>
  <text start="2307.63" dur="2.64">again this is not the first time they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2309.13" dur="3.69">said it but now they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="2310.27" dur="3.93">they have the optimism of they&amp;#39;re moving</text>
  <text start="2312.82" dur="2.76">ahead with indictments I think some</text>
  <text start="2314.2" dur="3.48">things came out they already have some</text>
  <text start="2315.58" dur="3.78">indictments on the board we know they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2317.68" dur="3.72">been trying to negotiate with Ecuador in</text>
  <text start="2319.36" dur="4.05">the UK to get hem pulled over here we</text>
  <text start="2321.4" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s behind that move yet I</text>
  <text start="2323.41" dur="2.94">suspect even if they brought him over</text>
  <text start="2324.97" dur="3.24">here they couldn&amp;#39;t prove the Trump</text>
  <text start="2326.35" dur="3.48">Russian collusion thing which I think</text>
  <text start="2328.21" dur="3.36">they would need to and I still suspect</text>
  <text start="2329.83" dur="5.07">Trump would if he didn&amp;#39;t get murdered</text>
  <text start="2331.57" dur="5.43">Trump would give him a pardon but do you</text>
  <text start="2334.9" dur="4.17">think that that is just part of the</text>
  <text start="2337" dur="4.71">timing to bring him over here or to</text>
  <text start="2339.07" dur="4.41">bring him on to the to the playing field</text>
  <text start="2341.71" dur="4.59">so to speak he&amp;#39;s been kind of timed out</text>
  <text start="2343.48" dur="5.31">for a while I think they&amp;#39;re using chess</text>
  <text start="2346.3" dur="4.17">parlance there&amp;#39;s no question easy he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2348.79" dur="3.86">been sitting on the sidelines and ready</text>
  <text start="2350.47" dur="4.47">to be activated and again it could be</text>
  <text start="2352.65" dur="4.36">you know it&amp;#39;d just be like playing with</text>
  <text start="2354.94" dur="4.92">sessions and Whitaker you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2357.01" dur="5.73">getting to see the high level ins and</text>
  <text start="2359.86" dur="4.95">outs the way that these people are void</text>
  <text start="2362.74" dur="4.98">Trump and QS positioning these things I</text>
  <text start="2364.81" dur="4.41">you know so I say it&amp;#39;s all positioning</text>
  <text start="2367.72" dur="4.05">move to may dust and I say that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2369.22" dur="5.7">planned and that&amp;#39;s the angle they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2371.77" dur="4.62">going I agree with it all right we we</text>
  <text start="2374.92" dur="3.63">talked about most of the things I had on</text>
  <text start="2376.39" dur="9.48">my list that I wanted to discuss a Tampa</text>
  <text start="2378.55" dur="9.63">rally we we had four folks it will</text>
  <text start="2385.87" dur="4.68">remember back he was saying all all in</text>
  <text start="2388.18" dur="4.8">the month of July that the world would</text>
  <text start="2390.55" dur="4.02">know by q and on it was sort of a you</text>
  <text start="2392.98" dur="3.57">know big proof for certainly all of us</text>
  <text start="2394.57" dur="4.86">that have been you know called you know</text>
  <text start="2396.55" dur="7.58">the you know every name in a book you</text>
  <text start="2399.43" dur="4.7">know like you know zombie-eyed yeah</text>
  <text start="2405.53" dur="9.25">better than most was a cobbler send</text>
  <text start="2412.98" dur="4.86">these by guide people I think zombie</text>
  <text start="2414.78" dur="5.43">eyes look clearly you know I have a</text>
  <text start="2417.84" dur="4.32">pretty monotone way of talking people</text>
  <text start="2420.21" dur="3.66">like you actually get a lot of</text>
  <text start="2422.16" dur="2.97">compliments about how I&amp;#39;m calm and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2423.87" dur="4.32">rational instead of getting really</text>
  <text start="2425.13" dur="5.34">emotional but I always respected Alex&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2428.19" dur="3.57">emotion I thought it was just he was a</text>
  <text start="2430.47" dur="2.37">little eccentric and I didn&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="2431.76" dur="2.99">was the best way of delivering</text>
  <text start="2432.84" dur="5.93">information but I could understand it</text>
  <text start="2434.75" dur="6.13">but to have Alex Jones spend 30 minutes</text>
  <text start="2438.77" dur="3.94">although in Troyer I thought that was</text>
  <text start="2440.88" dur="3.06">like that is a true kooky achievement</text>
  <text start="2442.71" dur="3">right there I&amp;#39;m kind of proud of it</text>
  <text start="2443.94" dur="4.17">actually I play boy yeah that&amp;#39;s a badge</text>
  <text start="2445.71" dur="4.08">of honor could people don&amp;#39;t even usually</text>

  <text start="2451.95" dur="3.87">somebody who&amp;#39;s well known I will know</text>
  <text start="2453.66" dur="4.11">and get a quote from them and I actually</text>
