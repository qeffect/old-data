  <text start="9.84" dur="6.35">comments filling up with some anger or</text>
  <text start="12.57" dur="6.84">support or or criticism or whatever</text>
  <text start="16.19" dur="5.679">let&amp;#39;s go into the alex jones issue once</text>
  <text start="19.41" dur="3.959">more so let me give a little bit of</text>
  <text start="21.869" dur="4.23">context here because I started the</text>
  <text start="23.369" dur="5.521">truther thing about 16 years ago roughly</text>
  <text start="26.099" dur="7.081">speaking and I was a teen late teenager</text>
  <text start="28.89" dur="6.36">and I Alex Jones was my red pill man he</text>
  <text start="33.18" dur="3.39">was he was you know that and like I kind</text>
  <text start="35.25" dur="2.79">of started with the zeitgeist film a</text>
  <text start="36.57" dur="2.669">little bit and learned about the Federal</text>
  <text start="38.04" dur="3.06">Reserve and the money system and</text>
  <text start="39.239" dur="4.021">fractional reserve banking and that got</text>
  <text start="41.1" dur="4.979">me into economics an investment but Alex</text>
  <text start="43.26" dur="5.729">was was my go-to source like I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="46.079" dur="6.991">even watch MSM since I was about 17 so I</text>
  <text start="48.989" dur="4.771">grew up on a diet of Alex Jones know he</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="3.75">was my hero</text>
  <text start="53.76" dur="4.619">alright and me coming out against him</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="3">lately is not something that I did</text>
  <text start="58.379" dur="3.151">lightly it was not something that was</text>
  <text start="59.82" dur="5.669">easy for me to do and it&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="61.53" dur="6.69">that I enjoy let me give you my thinking</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="5.341">as to why because there&amp;#39;s a lot of hate</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="4.35">in the comments and you know I go where</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="3.69">the evidence takes me if you guys have</text>
  <text start="72.57" dur="3.36">an argument and I&amp;#39;m wrong then I will</text>
  <text start="74.52" dur="4.23">admit that I&amp;#39;m wrong and I will change</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="5.82">my position however everything I see so</text>
  <text start="78.75" dur="7.799">far is just insults so in fact I&amp;#39;ll even</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="5.939">read you a few let&amp;#39;s see I kind of had</text>
  <text start="86.549" dur="5.64">to block some of them because they were</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="8.07">so vulgar but well I&amp;#39;ll scroll through</text>
  <text start="92.189" dur="6.591">while I&amp;#39;m talking so the things that may</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="8.511">lead me to believe in retrospect plus</text>
  <text start="98.78" dur="8.68">what&amp;#39;s going on now first of all I think</text>
  <text start="104.27" dur="5.76">95% of what alex says is true absolutely</text>
  <text start="107.46" dur="8.31">and he talks about some serious stuff</text>
  <text start="110.03" dur="7.6">but you know any any good controlled</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="3.87">opposition mixes in truth with lies and</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="4.65">the reason that I&amp;#39;m beginning to believe</text>
  <text start="119.64" dur="5.15">and kind of have started to believe that</text>
  <text start="122.28" dur="5.58">Alex Jones is controlled opposition is</text>
  <text start="124.79" dur="4.63">is not necessarily that he won&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="5.83">about Israel and stuff that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="129.42" dur="6.97">reason for some people you know but</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="5.43">he&amp;#39;s flopped on a couple of not on a</text>
  <text start="136.39" dur="4.74">number of occasions all right and and at</text>
  <text start="139.12" dur="3.78">the time I justified it by thinking he</text>
  <text start="141.13" dur="4.26">overextended himself and he was going to</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="3.57">implode his empire and and it would it</text>
  <text start="145.39" dur="4.2">would hurt the movement in the long run</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="6.69">pick your battles so what are some of</text>
  <text start="149.59" dur="7.05">these occasions well one Sandy Hook</text>
  <text start="153.16" dur="5.31">or he backed out on it kind of admitted</text>
  <text start="156.64" dur="3.57">blah blah blah that it was never you</text>
  <text start="158.47" dur="3.3">know what he said it was originally and</text>
  <text start="160.21" dur="7.17">we know there&amp;#39;s a lot of questions</text>
  <text start="161.77" dur="7.38">around that - pizza gate the reason like</text>
  <text start="167.38" dur="3.48">I said the reason that everyone claimed</text>
  <text start="169.15" dur="3.45">that it was debunked the msn went full</text>
  <text start="170.86" dur="3.27">bore on that saying oh it&amp;#39;s debunked</text>
  <text start="172.6" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s debunked was not because they</text>
  <text start="174.13" dur="4.89">debunked it at all just a slurs croakin</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="6.21">about this or any expert on pizza gate</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="6.33">research what really happened is that</text>
  <text start="182.74" dur="5.61">Alex Jones invited a low fantasy the</text>
  <text start="185.35" dur="6.54">pervert the pedophile the child rapist</text>
  <text start="188.35" dur="6.81">on his show and apologize to him and</text>
  <text start="191.89" dur="6.51">basically let a low fantasy just just</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="4.92">walk him around like a dog all right now</text>
  <text start="198.4" dur="3.99">at the time I I justified this by</text>
  <text start="200.08" dur="3.72">thinking well you know this the Sandy</text>
  <text start="202.39" dur="2.55">Hook thing is not working well for him</text>
  <text start="203.8" dur="3.6">in the media so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="204.94" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;re gonna use it against him or this</text>
  <text start="207.4" dur="3.33">Aliph antis thing well he&amp;#39;s going up</text>
  <text start="208.99" dur="3.42">against the Rothschilds here I mean some</text>
  <text start="210.73" dur="3.33">people think a low fantasy you know I</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t know how to pronounce it but Jame</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="6.63">they am font ace or whatever I love</text>
  <text start="216.19" dur="6.15">children right say it again okay so I</text>
  <text start="220.69" dur="3.69">love children or whatever right in</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="4.17">French and a lot of people think he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="6.54">Rothschild I mean one of the 25 or top</text>
  <text start="226.51" dur="6.449">50 most powerful people in DC how does</text>
  <text start="230.92" dur="5.67">that happen right he&amp;#39;s a he&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="232.959" dur="5.401">pizza shop on her and if you notice his</text>
  <text start="236.59" dur="3.75">social media accounts I&amp;#39;ve debated Pizza</text>
  <text start="238.36" dur="4.92">Gate plenty we know ala Fantas has a</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="5.13">pedophile and the reason that pizza gate</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="6.15">was was considered to be debunked and we</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="5.489">moved on as as a as a nation you know</text>
  <text start="249.43" dur="3.09">not us truthers obviously but as a</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="4.5">nation kind of moved on from that was</text>
  <text start="252.52" dur="3.96">because Alex back down now what about</text>
  <text start="255.459" dur="3.78">the Second Amendment</text>
  <text start="256.48" dur="5.249">well when Piers Morgan did his thing you</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="4.021">know and you know I was a big fan of</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="3.421">Alex when he went on piers the show and</text>
  <text start="263.26" dur="3.12">yelled at him and said 1776 will</text>
  <text start="265.15" dur="2.519">commence again if you try to take our</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="4.349">guns but</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="5.671">in retrospect was that really the best</text>
  <text start="270.729" dur="5.611">way to say that not the words but the</text>
  <text start="273.34" dur="4.5">the tone he looked like a crazy man and</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="3.99">scared everyone that was watching that</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="4.879">show on the left probably gave them a</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="4.32">lot more ammo than he gave us that day</text>
  <text start="282.719" dur="4.271">right like they could have used that</text>
  <text start="284.65" dur="6.389">scene and just look how crazy gun owners</text>
  <text start="286.99" dur="4.32">are and we need to stop this right you</text>
  <text start="291.039" dur="3.12">know</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="4.65">more recently Q has proven himself to us</text>
  <text start="294.159" dur="4.051">numerous times hundred plus pieces of</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="3.329">evidence trump has proven himself to us</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="2.97">and they have proven that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.289" dur="3.211">working together to my satisfaction</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;ve proven that they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="302.5" dur="4.169">together and I trust Trump and I trust Q</text>
  <text start="305.439" dur="2.91">they&amp;#39;re getting results they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="306.669" dur="4.411">taking down the deep state we can see</text>
  <text start="308.349" dur="6.03">this happen in real time Trump just said</text>
  <text start="311.08" dur="5.459">he&amp;#39;s gonna put Hillary in Gitmo well</text>
  <text start="314.379" dur="4.171">where was Alex when we needed him on</text>
  <text start="316.539" dur="5.28">pizza gate where was he when we needed</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="5.13">him to stay firm on Sandy Hook where was</text>
  <text start="321.819" dur="4.56">he when we needed him to stay calm on</text>
  <text start="323.68" dur="5.639">Second Amendment where was he when we</text>
  <text start="326.379" dur="5.4">needed him on he went on now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="329.319" dur="4.081">fall for the BS like I&amp;#39;m sorry if you</text>
  <text start="331.779" dur="3.45">disagree with me on this but I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="333.4" dur="2.97">any Bill Hicks and Alex Jones I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="335.229" dur="2.97">even think the birth dates lined up</text>
  <text start="336.37" dur="4.62">right okay that the facial structure</text>
  <text start="338.199" dur="4.53">certainly aren&amp;#39;t the same I was a big</text>
  <text start="340.99" dur="4.289">bill heck&amp;#39;s fan by the way I love Felix</text>
  <text start="342.729" dur="3.951">he&amp;#39;s hilarious and he talked about real</text>
  <text start="345.279" dur="3.87">stuff in his jokes</text>
  <text start="346.68" dur="6.4">he was obviously clearly an intelligent</text>
  <text start="349.149" dur="5.52">man but I don&amp;#39;t see anything with the</text>
  <text start="353.08" dur="2.97">whole Bill Hicks thing so it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="354.669" dur="5.25">that it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m one of those</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="5.339">folks but at the same point it seems</text>
  <text start="359.919" dur="3.541">like Alex just keeps letting us down</text>
  <text start="361.389" dur="5.731">when we need him the most and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.46" dur="5.669">this most recent example with cueing on</text>
  <text start="367.12" dur="3.719">where he&amp;#39;s basically saying he&amp;#39;s talked</text>
  <text start="369.129" dur="3.66">to Q and the people involved in Q and</text>
  <text start="370.839" dur="3.69">he&amp;#39;s talked to Q and the fallen or he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="372.789" dur="3.18">talked to people involved with Q on the</text>
  <text start="374.529" dur="2.581">phone at the golf course or at the golf</text>
  <text start="375.969" dur="2.88">course or something like that and and</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="5.76">then course he came out against Q as</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="6.451">well and then now he&amp;#39;s Pro Q again I and</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="4.319">in in pushing war and Iran and saying</text>
  <text start="385.3" dur="4.769">apparently saying Shalom a lot I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.189" dur="5.311">know but my position right now is that</text>
  <text start="390.069" dur="4.31">Alex Jones cannot be trusted Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="392.5" dur="4.409">cannot be trusted when it counts and</text>
  <text start="394.379" dur="4.54">Alex Jones cannot be trusted about Q and</text>
  <text start="396.909" dur="4.051">on now I still include Infowars and my</text>
  <text start="398.919" dur="3.5">sources they&amp;#39;d still do good work they</text>
  <text start="400.96" dur="4.109">talk about a lot of the other issues and</text>
  <text start="402.419" dur="4.15">that&amp;#39;s exactly what you would expect if</text>
  <text start="405.069" dur="3.391">you think about how to set up a</text>
  <text start="406.569" dur="4.771">controlled opposition you would probably</text>
  <text start="408.46" dur="7.95">want to get someone who&amp;#39;s passionate</text>
  <text start="411.34" dur="8.43">knows the arguments and and they would</text>
  <text start="416.41" dur="5.22">be you know 95% truth you know how else</text>
  <text start="419.77" dur="3.36">are you gonna get the credibility how is</text>
  <text start="421.63" dur="3.509">she gonna gain the trust this is deep</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="5.12">trust he&amp;#39;s earned how do you earn deep</text>
  <text start="425.139" dur="5.551">trust well you talk about real stuff and</text>
  <text start="428.25" dur="5.949">you just you just drop the ball at the</text>
  <text start="430.69" dur="7.44">wrong times that&amp;#39;s all and I am tired of</text>
  <text start="434.199" dur="7.831">making excuses for Alex Jones now let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.13" dur="6.659">talk about censorship I and others and</text>
  <text start="442.03" dur="5.009">qfd banned all right that means on</text>
  <text start="444.789" dur="3.6">Twitter that we&amp;#39;re shadow around and it</text>
  <text start="447.039" dur="2.641">seems like there&amp;#39;s a pattern because if</text>
  <text start="448.389" dur="3.21">you search pretty much any and you can</text>
  <text start="449.68" dur="5.88">do this for yourselves their website set</text>
  <text start="451.599" dur="7.711">up for this anyone who is pro-q in the</text>
  <text start="455.56" dur="5.729">alt media is qfr banned now anyone who</text>
  <text start="459.31" dur="6.479">is anti Q in the alt media like Jack</text>
  <text start="461.289" dur="7.021">mazovick and Li Stranahan and and Alex</text>
  <text start="465.789" dur="5.88">Jones Infowars they&amp;#39;re not qfd banned</text>
  <text start="468.31" dur="6.51">now yes he&amp;#39;s being outright banned and</text>
  <text start="471.669" dur="5.701">censored but whoever did this would</text>
  <text start="474.82" dur="4.589">clear like do you think that the people</text>
  <text start="477.37" dur="4.079">who banned him the tech giant&amp;#39;s or the</text>
  <text start="479.409" dur="3.271">deep state or whoever&amp;#39;s behind it do you</text>
  <text start="481.449" dur="2.581">think that they didn&amp;#39;t know that it was</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="4.109">going to bring him more support more</text>
  <text start="484.03" dur="4.56">Streisand effect maybe this is</text>
  <text start="486.789" dur="3.541">intentional because what are the fruits</text>
  <text start="488.59" dur="5.49">of the tree well everyone is jumping to</text>
  <text start="490.33" dur="9.389">Alex&amp;#39;s defense he&amp;#39;s growing huge and at</text>
  <text start="494.08" dur="8.04">the same point people are now engaged in</text>
  <text start="499.719" dur="4.141">a war between Alex and Q sort of you</text>
  <text start="502.12" dur="3.289">know it look at my comments I&amp;#39;m deleting</text>
  <text start="503.86" dur="3.809">a lot of the vulgar ones I don&amp;#39;t delete</text>
  <text start="505.409" dur="4.841">comments that are critical of me to have</text>
  <text start="507.669" dur="4.62">actual arguments but I delete comments</text>
  <text start="510.25" dur="3.779">that are you know just full of cuss</text>
  <text start="512.289" dur="3.3">words and barely speak English you know</text>
  <text start="514.029" dur="2.64">I don&amp;#39;t talk crazy talk and I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="515.589" dur="2.041">time to read through that kind of crap</text>
  <text start="516.669" dur="6.511">so I&amp;#39;m just gonna ban you from the</text>
  <text start="517.63" dur="8.28">channel so you know what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="523.18" dur="4.469">what&amp;#39;s the other side of this coin okay</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="4.41">so yeah the other side of this coin is</text>
  <text start="527.649" dur="4.081">that you know maybe this is part of some</text>
  <text start="530.32" dur="4.17">sort of larger scheme that I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="6.3">figured out maybe this is</text>
  <text start="534.49" dur="5.1">just for DHS maybe Alex is is just part</text>
  <text start="538.03" dur="4.95">of this whole thing and he&amp;#39;s playing his</text>
  <text start="539.59" dur="4.86">part to perfection but we know Alec you</text>
  <text start="542.98" dur="2.07">know we we know that Q has proven</text>
  <text start="544.45" dur="3.06">himself</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="4.14">we know he was gotten results we know</text>
  <text start="547.51" dur="3.87">the fruit of this tree is that alex is</text>
  <text start="549.19" dur="4.74">getting a lot of attention not getting</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="6.99">shadow band and not getting censored</text>
  <text start="553.93" dur="5.91">he&amp;#39;s getting more attention and and the</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="3.9">people that we are up against are smart</text>
  <text start="559.84" dur="4.61">enough to know these things and Q has</text>
  <text start="562.27" dur="6.27">called him out three to four times now</text>
  <text start="564.45" dur="6.13">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s go through that one Q as I</text>
  <text start="568.54" dur="4.23">went through in my last video Q</text>
