  <text start="60.469" dur="4.8">most of us did I just passively accepted</text>
  <text start="62.66" dur="3.38">the government&amp;#39;s explanation Oswald did</text>

  <text start="77.78" dur="4.619">was enraged that this pothead director</text>
  <text start="80.24" dur="3.42">would dare to suggest that elements of</text>
  <text start="82.399" dur="4.14">our own government killed our own</text>

  <text start="224.66" dur="3.63">everybody for being here if somebody of</text>
  <text start="226.37" dur="4.59">you read my book so I thank you for</text>
  <text start="228.29" dur="5.67">doing that it took quite a lot to write</text>
  <text start="230.96" dur="4.2">it I had to relive a lot by doing that I</text>
  <text start="233.96" dur="5.55">had to put my wedding through there</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="6.9">wasn&amp;#39;t really fair for her let me first</text>
  <text start="239.51" dur="4.979">tell you the reason why I&amp;#39;m here I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="242.06" dur="4.89">a public person it&amp;#39;s not something I</text>
  <text start="244.489" dur="4.651">want to be famous or anything like them</text>
  <text start="246.95" dur="5.31">I wrote the book because I felt an</text>
  <text start="249.14" dur="6.33">obligation an obligation to the people</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="5.099">that had perished before me in regard to</text>
  <text start="255.47" dur="4.56">the love of this country I had children</text>
  <text start="257.359" dur="4.5">which changed me as well I prayed a lot</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="3.75">for that opportunity when I was in</text>
  <text start="261.859" dur="5.371">prison I thought jeez I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="263.78" dur="6.389">die here be very lonely place to do to</text>
  <text start="267.23" dur="4.29">go that way I thought when I go I want</text>
  <text start="270.169" dur="4.111">to be able to have someone that looks</text>
  <text start="271.52" dur="5.55">back into my eyes and said ah I love you</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="5.22">thank you and I&amp;#39;ll be here at the end</text>
  <text start="277.07" dur="5.55">and maybe some dogs think that I love</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="5.82">along the way as well and so I was</text>
  <text start="282.62" dur="5.85">granted that opportunity and so because</text>
  <text start="285.32" dur="6.23">I was granted that opportunity I felt an</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="5.46">obligation to my mother who had perished</text>
  <text start="291.55" dur="2.98">from the stress of this I think about</text>
  <text start="293.93" dur="4.92">her every day</text>
  <text start="294.53" dur="9.3">I feel terribly responsible for her</text>
  <text start="298.85" dur="8.37">death and possibly the death of JFK jr.</text>
  <text start="303.83" dur="5.25">as well in part I know that President</text>
  <text start="307.22" dur="4.35">Kennedy I was not supposed to win the</text>
  <text start="309.08" dur="4.04">election in 1960 I&amp;#39;m supposed to Richard</text>
  <text start="311.57" dur="4.98">Nixon to come and die</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.87">his father had made sure that he had if</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="4.22">you want to use the word stolen or how</text>
  <text start="317.99" dur="6.33">about Fox to the Foxes as it were and</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="6.04">put him into the Oval Office they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="324.32" dur="4.44">hoped he&amp;#39;d beat the cold warrior for</text>
  <text start="326.81" dur="5.73">them and to operate in a way that would</text>
  <text start="328.76" dur="7.23">be adequate to the plans were put in</text>
  <text start="332.54" dur="7.29">place since World War two but President</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="5.46">Kennedy had had realized that there was</text>
  <text start="339.83" dur="6.09">a lot more important things at stake</text>
  <text start="341.45" dur="8.73">here that the operation is of the</text>
  <text start="345.92" dur="7.32">Pentagon the CIA and that they were</text>
  <text start="350.18" dur="5.49">really acting drunken insane with power</text>
  <text start="353.24" dur="4.68">and could see that this was not going to</text>
  <text start="355.67" dur="3.69">end well but the fact remains that</text>
  <text start="357.92" dur="3.18">President Kennedy had turned his</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="3.18">direction to the people of the United</text>
  <text start="361.1" dur="2.88">States and people of the world</text>
  <text start="362.54" dur="3.29">that&amp;#39;s what we were mattered life</text>
  <text start="363.98" dur="4.59">mattered and this was not in the</text>
  <text start="365.83" dur="5.11">operational interests of the people in</text>
  <text start="368.57" dur="3.87">power so I could tell you things that</text>
  <text start="370.94" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;ve been exposed to that I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="372.44" dur="6.24">write in the book because I held back a</text>
  <text start="374.24" dur="6.12">lot the fear of the repercussions to my</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="4.41">family now I still think a lot about</text>
  <text start="380.36" dur="4.47">that I&amp;#39;m being exposed to people that</text>
  <text start="383.09" dur="6.03">have approached me because they&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="384.83" dur="7.08">the book and I say CIA Special Forces</text>
  <text start="389.12" dur="4.92">and two gentlemen right now that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="391.91" dur="4.32">been in contact with who is currently</text>
  <text start="394.04" dur="3.81">operating now in conjunction with the</text>
  <text start="396.23" dur="3.54">Department of Justice and giving them</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="4.74">documentation that they&amp;#39;re requesting</text>
  <text start="399.77" dur="5.04">that will lead to arrests and have led</text>
  <text start="402.59" dur="5.94">to arrest I have begged him to operate</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="5.82">under protection and immunity and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="408.53" dur="3.48">provided him contact with a federal</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="3.03">Attorney now he&amp;#39;s working with the US</text>
  <text start="412.01" dur="4.56">Senate to give him immunity in this</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="5.01">regard he&amp;#39;s also working to arrange for</text>
  <text start="416.57" dur="5.28">Julian Assange was released from</text>
  <text start="418.67" dur="6.72">prosecution in United States President</text>
  <text start="421.85" dur="6.06">Kennedy took it upon himself to put into</text>
  <text start="425.39" dur="5.48">action and I won&amp;#39;t say the word covert</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="6.24">but around the intelligence communities</text>
  <text start="430.87" dur="5.23">so he could contact the world leaders</text>
  <text start="434.15" dur="4.71">and make arrangements to end the Cold</text>
  <text start="436.1" dur="4.2">War and put a stop to this insanity</text>
  <text start="438.86" dur="4.8">before it was too late</text>
  <text start="440.3" dur="4.97">in fact the intelligence community is</text>
  <text start="443.66" dur="3.75">given no choice</text>
  <text start="445.27" dur="4.36">he was declared a national security</text>
  <text start="447.41" dur="4.11">threat to United States nor is that main</text>
  <text start="449.63" dur="4.05">national security threat the United</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="3.03">States I was a national security threat</text>
  <text start="453.68" dur="2.61">to United State</text>
  <text start="454.55" dur="3.39">that means you were acting in the</text>
  <text start="456.29" dur="4.71">interest against the power and the money</text>
  <text start="457.94" dur="6.24">and so therefore you have to be dealt</text>
  <text start="461" dur="5.28">with my way the other what you do when</text>
  <text start="464.18" dur="5.58">you you swim in a river or a lake or a</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="5.21">pond or an ocean in this regard that</text>
  <text start="469.76" dur="5.03">your own government says doesn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="471.49" dur="5.44">it&amp;#39;s not there it must be mistaken</text>
  <text start="474.79" dur="4.81">behind closed doors it&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="476.93" dur="4.35">story I was interrogated but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="479.6" dur="3.66">questioning but Justice Department</text>
  <text start="481.28" dur="2.94">intelligence communities well that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="483.26" dur="3.39">- bye</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="6.08">so I come out of a prison sentence so</text>
  <text start="486.65" dur="8.97">messed up I couldn&amp;#39;t speak properly I</text>
  <text start="490.3" dur="7.78">ship all the time I couldn&amp;#39;t write my</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="4.35">brain certainly wasn&amp;#39;t functioning in a</text>
  <text start="498.08" dur="4.01">way that treatments to be able to stand</text>
  <text start="499.97" dur="4.71">up and talk to you intelligently today</text>
  <text start="502.09" dur="6">so it was a constant battle and a fight</text>
  <text start="504.68" dur="6.18">for me to recover from that time period</text>
  <text start="508.09" dur="5.47">I&amp;#39;m still working on but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.86" dur="4.38">important that I overcome that so that I</text>
  <text start="513.56" dur="5.1">can tell people that I experienced</text>
  <text start="515.24" dur="5.91">firsthand some one thing to have to read</text>
  <text start="518.66" dur="3.99">something in a book it&amp;#39;s entirely</text>
  <text start="521.15" dur="3.21">different to see it and feel it in</text>
  <text start="522.65" dur="4.17">person to know it in your heart you</text>
  <text start="524.36" dur="4.65">can&amp;#39;t erase that first again I took upon</text>
  <text start="526.82" dur="4.68">himself consciously to circumvent the</text>
  <text start="529.01" dur="6.81">actions that were put in place in World</text>
  <text start="531.5" dur="6.09">War two and that was to change the</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="3.54">course of the United States which</text>
  <text start="537.59" dur="4.05">wouldn&amp;#39;t be what James - forces world</text>
  <text start="539.36" dur="4.11">bent Bobby came he had a big hand at</text>
  <text start="541.64" dur="3.21">that they looked at the numbers at the</text>
  <text start="543.47" dur="4.38">first strike on Moscow and they were</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="6.39">looking at 42 million Americans dead on</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="5.22">a first strike or 100 million dead if</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="4.11">they didn&amp;#39;t get diverse strike come on</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="4.17">properly and that was unacceptable to</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="5.28">both Kennedy brothers David they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="557.24" dur="6.06">think the 42 million Americans did was</text>
  <text start="560.63" dur="3.9">an acceptable thing to play with because</text>
  <text start="563.3" dur="3.42">if somebody would have been alone</text>
  <text start="564.53" dur="4.41">decides and a think tank this is what we</text>
  <text start="566.72" dur="5.64">have to do we don&amp;#39;t have a choice</text>
  <text start="568.94" dur="5.4">I think we all have choices God knows if</text>
  <text start="572.36" dur="3.66">the American people had to make these</text>
  <text start="574.34" dur="3.12">choices I think they make very different</text>
  <text start="576.02" dur="4.38">choices and a lot of the people that are</text>
  <text start="577.46" dur="5.04">been placed in power Nixon came on board</text>
  <text start="580.4" dur="3.78">later after Johnson and Nixon had</text>
  <text start="582.5" dur="3.24">something on Johnson and Johnson had</text>
  <text start="584.18" dur="3.33">something on Nixon and John&amp;#39;s want to</text>
  <text start="585.74" dur="4.26">make sure that his presidency was</text>
  <text start="587.51" dur="4.86">covered taken care of and then Nixon got</text>
  <text start="590" dur="3.99">his tail caught the door if he hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="592.37" dur="2.76">been pardoned by the incoming president</text>
  <text start="593.99" dur="2.61">if the American people have learned a</text>
  <text start="595.13" dur="3.66">lot about what happened to the Kennedy</text>
