  <text start="0.03" dur="4.829">hey guys this is Dustin Nemo&amp;#39;s of the</text>
  <text start="2.97" dur="4.02">Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="4.859" dur="4.051">bring you an interesting breakdown on</text>
  <text start="6.99" dur="3.689">some of the benefits of carbon 60</text>
  <text start="8.91" dur="5.16">fullerenes now you guys may have heard</text>
  <text start="10.679" dur="4.92">that name bucky balls or fullerenes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.07" dur="4.379">usually called bucky balls in college as</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="5.52">i think and fullerenes and c 60 carbon</text>
  <text start="18.449" dur="5.521">60 and also the full name for those who</text>
  <text start="21.119" dur="5.91">are curious buckminsterfullerene x&amp;#39; okay</text>
  <text start="23.97" dur="5.43">named in honor of Buckminster himself</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="4.351">Buckminster Fuller who created and</text>
  <text start="29.4" dur="4.26">designed the you guys may remember those</text>
  <text start="31.38" dur="4.109">little triangle domes that they did like</text>
  <text start="33.66" dur="2.22">the geodesic domes that was one of his</text>
  <text start="35.489" dur="3">things</text>
  <text start="35.88" dur="4.65">now the dome structure being very strong</text>
  <text start="38.489" dur="4.651">and stuff it&amp;#39;s very reminiscent of the</text>
  <text start="40.53" dur="4.77">carbon 60 molecule you can kind of see</text>
  <text start="43.14" dur="4.5">it right here it&amp;#39;s a little blurry right</text>
  <text start="45.3" dur="4.529">there and maybe I apologize for that</text>
  <text start="47.64" dur="4.71">let me see if I can perfect you can see</text>
  <text start="49.829" dur="6.3">that little soccer ball shape right that</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="6.029">is a carbon 60 molecule this is from red</text>
  <text start="56.129" dur="4.921">polluting calm one of our sponsors here</text>
  <text start="58.379" dur="4.261">at the show for Nemo&amp;#39;s news network now</text>
  <text start="61.05" dur="3.509">this video is going to be kind of an</text>
  <text start="62.64" dur="4.44">introduction right this is gonna be a</text>
  <text start="64.559" dur="4.56">breakdown of what carbon 60 is and some</text>
  <text start="67.08" dur="3.84">of the benefits behind it and why why</text>
  <text start="69.119" dur="4.951">I&amp;#39;m even making this video why is it so</text>
  <text start="70.92" dur="4.89">exciting wise in my opinion carbon 60</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="4.02">the most exciting thing an alternative</text>
  <text start="75.81" dur="3.93">health or even mainstream health which</text>
  <text start="78.09" dur="4.77">they haven&amp;#39;t caught on yet even</text>
  <text start="79.74" dur="5.4">allopathic health ever found and I mean</text>
  <text start="82.86" dur="4.89">even more exciting than antibiotics</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="3.96">which a third of you would not even be</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="3.479">watching this if were not for</text>
  <text start="89.1" dur="4.05">antibiotics now there were great I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="91.229" dur="3.361">glad we found penicillin and all of the</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="4.35">the health boom that came with</text>
  <text start="94.59" dur="5.22">antibiotics but they are failing and I</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="4.92">think that this material in my own</text>
  <text start="99.81" dur="5.43">opinion is way more exciting than even</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="6.269">antibiotics that&amp;#39;s how big a deal carbon</text>
  <text start="105.24" dur="5.22">60 is now red pill living has one of the</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="3.72">best highest quality supplements out</text>
  <text start="110.46" dur="4.979">there called carbon shield which is a</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="5.701">high quality organic food based edible</text>
  <text start="115.439" dur="4.14">oil that all of in the coconut are the</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="5.67">primary ones there&amp;#39;s a few others as</text>
  <text start="119.579" dur="5.97">well but these oils have amazing</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="4.619">properties I mean very interesting</text>
  <text start="125.549" dur="4.38">results and studies including by the way</text>
  <text start="128.399" dur="4.441">and I&amp;#39;ll go through all of this in the</text>
  <text start="129.929" dur="4.951">video doubling the lifespan of</text>
  <text start="132.84" dur="4.17">now I don&amp;#39;t think I covered this in the</text>
  <text start="134.88" dur="4.2">video I&amp;#39;m not sure because it&amp;#39;s an older</text>
  <text start="137.01" dur="3.63">video you may hear like apex health</text>
  <text start="139.08" dur="2.19">mentioned that was that was red pills</text>
  <text start="140.64" dur="2.97">old name</text>
  <text start="141.27" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve rebranded but I thought it was</text>
  <text start="143.61" dur="4.74">still really useful information and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="145.74" dur="5.43">even discovered since that not only were</text>
  <text start="148.35" dur="5.04">they trying to poison the rats with c60</text>
  <text start="151.17" dur="3.539">to see what the toxic dose is and they</text>
  <text start="153.39" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t they were fine</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="4.831">couldn&amp;#39;t poison them and they were also</text>
  <text start="157.08" dur="4.89">giving them other poisons other toxins</text>
  <text start="159.54" dur="5.04">and the c60 not only didn&amp;#39;t poison them</text>
  <text start="161.97" dur="5.4">but protected them from the other toxins</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="4.65">because carbon 60 has an anti toxic</text>
  <text start="167.37" dur="3.81">effect when it&amp;#39;s combined with food oils</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="3.57">so it was really interesting that they</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="4.17">were trying to kill these lab rats</text>
  <text start="172.8" dur="5.64">couldn&amp;#39;t even kill it becuase of just</text>
  <text start="175.35" dur="6.03">how amazing carbon 60 is and those rats</text>
  <text start="178.44" dur="4.56">they doubled their lifespan they live to</text>
  <text start="181.38" dur="4.139">be almost the equivalent of a human</text>
  <text start="183" dur="5.519">being a 200 year old human which is very</text>
  <text start="185.519" dur="5.371">interesting and very new and and very</text>
  <text start="188.519" dur="4.47">much a breakthrough in science now other</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="3.929">people are giving other feedback and</text>
  <text start="192.989" dur="3.84">testimonials saying how it&amp;#39;s helped them</text>
  <text start="194.819" dur="3.631">with everything from macular</text>
  <text start="196.829" dur="4.38">degeneration you know kind of losing the</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="4.319">vision from age everything over to their</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="4.651">their pets are having a better quality</text>
  <text start="202.769" dur="5.131">of life decreased pain you know</text>
  <text start="205.86" dur="3.599">decreased irritability even snappiness</text>
  <text start="207.9" dur="4.08">and some pets because they were in so</text>
  <text start="209.459" dur="4.861">much pain I&amp;#39;ve had that one gentleman</text>
  <text start="211.98" dur="4.38">told me his stem cells like quadrupled I</text>
  <text start="214.32" dur="4.169">did an interview with him one lady got</text>
  <text start="216.36" dur="4.02">rid of her acne and other things I did</text>
  <text start="218.489" dur="4.051">an interview with her one lady had</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="3.6">autoimmune disorders her entire life was</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="3.36">bedridden most of her life and her</text>
  <text start="223.98" dur="4.83">family her daughter&amp;#39;s couldn&amp;#39;t help her</text>
  <text start="225.9" dur="4.86">to get out of bed carbon 60 did help her</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="4.019">so I did an interview with her as well</text>
  <text start="230.76" dur="4.259">that was Rhonda you guys can check that</text>
  <text start="232.829" dur="4.201">out on my youtube channel and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="6.901">lot of other you know potential benefits</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="7.079">here including hair regrowth 16% in one</text>
  <text start="241.92" dur="3.9">study there there&amp;#39;s just so many</text>
  <text start="244.109" dur="3.211">interesting benefits so hopefully you</text>
  <text start="245.82" dur="4.05">guys will take the time to watch this</text>
  <text start="247.32" dur="4.59">pretty long video for your own you know</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="4.8">edification enjoyment and education</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="4.47">because I don&amp;#39;t think anyone wants to</text>
  <text start="254.67" dur="5.28">stay ignorant of this particular</text>
  <text start="256.38" dur="6.9">material now for those who want to get</text>
  <text start="259.95" dur="5.31">it I will I will I would be remiss if I</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="3.38">didn&amp;#39;t plug you know red pill living you</text>
  <text start="265.26" dur="3.83">know our sponsor here red pill</text>
  <text start="266.66" dur="5.31">living this is the olive oil variety</text>
  <text start="269.09" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s the only olive oil our</text>
  <text start="271.97" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;m sorry the only carbon 60 out there</text>
  <text start="274.01" dur="5.13">that actually has the GMP label on it</text>
  <text start="276.35" dur="4.38">and this was made and obviously in an</text>
  <text start="279.14" dur="3.24">FDA lab everything else a lot of them</text>
  <text start="280.73" dur="3.81">are home brews this is the highest</text>
  <text start="282.38" dur="4.41">quality kind of oil you can get you can</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="4.53">taste the actual difference</text>
  <text start="286.79" dur="4.2">some people even complain because our</text>
  <text start="289.07" dur="3.81">olive oil is a little spicy and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="290.99" dur="3.69">real olive oil that means it&amp;#39;s the real</text>
  <text start="292.88" dur="2.91">deal because it&amp;#39;s authentic and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="294.68" dur="3.81">high-quality and you get all those</text>
  <text start="295.79" dur="5.55">benefits a lot of olive oils are more</text>
  <text start="298.49" dur="6.33">bland because 95% in this industry of</text>
  <text start="301.34" dur="7.77">olive oil specifically our scammy or</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="6.93">adulterated or cut or moldy and then of</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="4.44">course the fluorine market itself for</text>
  <text start="311.75" dur="4.14">those who are curious before we jump</text>
  <text start="313.55" dur="4.47">into the actual educational portion the</text>
  <text start="315.89" dur="4.41">fullerene market itself has people</text>
  <text start="318.02" dur="4.35">selling everything from from activated</text>
  <text start="320.3" dur="4.62">charcoal I&amp;#39;ve seen that where it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="4.14">really c60 at all they just say it has</text>
  <text start="324.92" dur="3.27">naturally-occurring see there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="326.51" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s no evidence to suggest that</text>
  <text start="328.19" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re just scamming people ripping</text>
  <text start="330.32" dur="4.17">them off maybe not intentionally maybe</text>
  <text start="332.36" dur="4.56">they just believe that right some people</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="4.71">sell solvents still in the carbon 60</text>
  <text start="336.92" dur="4.83">because the way they make this they they</text>
  <text start="339.2" dur="5.07">create it by bouncing electricity back</text>
  <text start="341.75" dur="4.56">and forth between graphite rods like in</text>
  <text start="344.27" dur="3.63">a pencil the graphite and then they</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="3.27">flake off little pieces and then they</text>
  <text start="347.9" dur="5.1">mix them with toxic solvents like</text>
  <text start="349.58" dur="5.1">toluene in order to withdraw and</text>
  <text start="353" dur="4.74">separate the different types of fuller</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="6.93">range like C 60 or c 70 or something so</text>
  <text start="357.74" dur="5.7">that some people don&amp;#39;t realize as toxic</text>
  <text start="361.61" dur="3.15">effects like toluene poisoning if you</text>
  <text start="363.44" dur="3.75">look that up on YouTube it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="364.76" dur="3.99">scary and they don&amp;#39;t remember or they</text>
  <text start="367.19" dur="2.88">don&amp;#39;t know that they&amp;#39;re supposed to to</text>
  <text start="368.75" dur="2.97">get the stuff that does not have</text>
  <text start="370.07" dur="3.63">solvents in it so some people sell it</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="3.27">with the solvents then completely out of</text>
  <text start="373.7" dur="1.71">ignorance I&amp;#39;m sure they don&amp;#39;t mean to do</text>
  <text start="374.99" dur="2.73">that</text>
  <text start="375.41" dur="4.08">but that&amp;#39;s another example of kind of a</text>
  <text start="377.72" dur="3.87">quality centric focus here at red pill</text>
  <text start="379.49" dur="4.05">living anyway I just wanted you guys to</text>
  <text start="381.59" dur="3.51">enjoy a little bit of context because</text>
  <text start="383.54" dur="3.57">I&amp;#39;m gonna throw you with a year old</text>
  <text start="385.1" dur="3.78">video and it may be a little bit out of</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="4.17">date but it still got some really good</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="4.59">information so let me know what you</text>
  <text start="391.28" dur="3.6">think in the comments below and let me</text>
  <text start="393.47" dur="4.35">know if you have had a personal</text>
  <text start="394.88" dur="4.369">experience with carbon 60 or fullerenes</text>
  <text start="397.82" dur="3.379">and maybe you want to come on the show</text>
  <text start="399.249" dur="4.26">and tell about your your testimonial</text>
  <text start="401.199" dur="3.03">that would be fun as well you can reach</text>
  <text start="403.509" dur="3.3">me through</text>
  <text start="404.229" dur="5.34">Dustin Nemo&amp;#39;s com if you want to do that</text>
  <text start="406.809" dur="6.2">all right guys I hope you enjoy and here</text>
  <text start="409.569" dur="7.59">we go we go welcome to the tutorial</text>
  <text start="413.009" dur="6.85">introduction overview primer whatever</text>
  <text start="417.159" dur="5.66">you want to call it of carbon 60 what is</text>
  <text start="419.859" dur="6.14">possibly one of the most interesting and</text>
  <text start="422.819" dur="6.76">dare I say miraculous products out there</text>
  <text start="425.999" dur="5.11">the the hype behind this product is that</text>
  <text start="429.579" dur="3.031">it can make you live twice as long and</text>
  <text start="431.109" dur="4.65">all of that other stuff we&amp;#39;ve all heard</text>
  <text start="432.61" dur="4.589">well let&amp;#39;s figure out what the truth is</text>
  <text start="435.759" dur="4.23">must go through the actual science</text>
  <text start="437.199" dur="5.4">together so this is a little video I put</text>
  <text start="439.989" dur="4.621">together on a program called powtoon so</text>
  <text start="442.599" dur="4.14">completely new to it not very good with</text>
  <text start="444.61" dur="3.209">it yet but let me know anything I might</text>
  <text start="446.739" dur="4.74">be able to start doing some of these</text>
  <text start="447.819" dur="5.67">kind of slideshows with that said let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="451.479" dur="6.96">dive right into all of the juicy details</text>
  <text start="453.489" dur="6.93">so introduction on April 10th 2012 a</text>
  <text start="458.439" dur="5.28">study entitled at the prolongation of</text>
  <text start="460.419" dur="6.27">the lifespan of rats by repeated oral</text>

  <text start="468.999" dur="4.77">peer-reviewed journal biomaterials</text>
  <text start="471.329" dur="5.44">according to the study by feeding rats</text>

  <text start="478.809" dur="5.73">increased by up to 90 percent in its</text>
  <text start="481.689" dur="4.62">conclusion the study states that quote C</text>

  <text start="490.239" dur="6.27">researcher professor fatima lhasa or</text>
  <text start="493.449" dur="5.52">musa nice try to say that said that c 60</text>
  <text start="496.509" dur="6">is quote absolutely not toxic even</text>
  <text start="498.969" dur="5.88">taking long term end quote okay no</text>
  <text start="502.509" dur="3.9">claims and medical claims this is not a</text>
  <text start="504.849" dur="3.21">medical advice or anything like that</text>
  <text start="506.409" dur="3.09">just letting you know what the</text>
  <text start="508.059" dur="4.59">scientists that did the study on the</text>
  <text start="509.499" dur="5.4">rats himself is saying obviously I</text>
  <text start="512.649" dur="3.81">cannot make claims about this stuff I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="514.899" dur="3.18">you know all the FDA and all the</text>
  <text start="516.459" dur="3.36">regulations and all the rules I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="518.079" dur="3.51">want to deal with that so I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="519.819" dur="2.91">even try I&amp;#39;m just gonna give you the</text>
  <text start="521.589" dur="2.79">evidence and let you make up your own</text>
  <text start="522.729" dur="4.11">mind which is the best way to do it</text>
  <text start="524.379" dur="6.481">anyway so let&amp;#39;s go through a couple of</text>
  <text start="526.839" dur="5.861">quick facts about it 1 carbon atoms 60</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="3.64">carbon atoms arranged in a sippy</text>

  <text start="603.74" dur="4.44">now this isn&amp;#39;t this is important because</text>
  <text start="605.93" dur="4.65">generally speaking of the study says</text>
  <text start="608.18" dur="3.81">about ninety percent increased lifespans</text>
  <text start="610.58" dur="3.66">so people take it to me and it doubles</text>
  <text start="611.99" dur="4.26">your life however it is important to</text>
  <text start="614.24" dur="6.6">remember that they did not give this as</text>
  <text start="616.25" dur="5.61">far as I know to to baby mice and feed</text>

  <text start="621.86" dur="3.03">lifetime</text>
  <text start="623" dur="5.7">I think the gate already gave it to</text>
  <text start="624.89" dur="5.58">adult mice so if theoretically they had</text>
  <text start="628.7" dur="3.99">done that from birth how much longer</text>
  <text start="630.47" dur="4.37">might the same rat have lived if they</text>
  <text start="632.69" dur="5.85">had benefited from that same effect for</text>
  <text start="634.84" dur="4.81">a much longer period of time and yes of</text>
  <text start="638.54" dur="2.73">course there was all of the organ</text>
  <text start="639.65" dur="3.06">rejuvenation and stuff in these older</text>

  <text start="642.71" dur="4.65">the first place nearly as badly right</text>
  <text start="644.74" dur="4.84">maybe it&amp;#39;s better and more effective if</text>
  <text start="647.36" dur="5.12">you can get it at a younger age and</text>
  <text start="649.58" dur="4.83">preserve rather than try to repair</text>
  <text start="652.48" dur="6.04">prevention is worth an ounce of cure as</text>
  <text start="654.41" dur="6.45">they say so this is just a little bit of</text>
  <text start="658.52" dur="3.84">conjecture on my part and I&amp;#39;ve read some</text>
  <text start="660.86" dur="3.219">things from other people that suggested</text>

  <text start="767.339" dur="7.17">very good at that and continuing on</text>
  <text start="771.899" dur="4.23">something that by absorbing nearby acids</text>

  <text start="848.54" dur="7.23">another day and the let&amp;#39;s see the</text>
  <text start="853.13" dur="4.65">proposed mechanism indicates that c60</text>
  <text start="855.77" dur="3.96">has the ability to acquire positive</text>

  <text start="906.86" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s one of the most commonly known and</text>
  <text start="909.2" dur="5.85">accepted ones as well and in has tons of</text>
  <text start="912.71" dur="4.35">research on it I think you can evenly</text>
  <text start="915.05" dur="3.24">legally make claims about vitamin C I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="917.06" dur="3.36">not sure because there&amp;#39;s just so much</text>
  <text start="918.29" dur="4.14">research about Hinde it however that</text>
  <text start="920.42" dur="4.5">said this stuff is like I said over</text>

  <text start="924.92" dur="3.84">keep that in mind and as I&amp;#39;m about to</text>
  <text start="927.05" dur="4.05">say here it&amp;#39;s a cattle</text>

  <text start="1014.5" dur="4.199">about that a lot but yeah if you&amp;#39;re into</text>

  <text start="1027.699" dur="4.88">stuff let&amp;#39;s see what is the next slide</text>
  <text start="1034.119" dur="5.31">okay this is just ten health benefits of</text>
  <text start="1036.739" dur="5.19">c60 obviously there&amp;#39;s far more than this</text>

  <text start="1061.97" dur="2.88">heard really good stuff by some of the</text>
  <text start="1063.259" dur="3.48">like NASA scientists and stuff behind</text>
  <text start="1064.85" dur="3.779">this a lot of the research where they</text>
  <text start="1066.739" dur="4.461">were giving it to parents and things</text>
  <text start="1068.629" dur="6.571">that reverse their mental decay or dogs</text>
  <text start="1071.2" dur="6.039">who had really bad cataracts and</text>
  <text start="1075.2" dur="4.25">reversed the cataracts so that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1077.239" dur="5.701">lot of there&amp;#39;s a lot of rejuvenation and</text>
  <text start="1079.45" dur="4.659">and turning back the clock on some of</text>
  <text start="1082.94" dur="3.479">these things that&amp;#39;s how powerful this</text>
  <text start="1084.109" dur="4.95">really is at least according to their</text>
  <text start="1086.419" dur="5.45">you know subjective personal experiences</text>
  <text start="1089.059" dur="6.3">but but they&amp;#39;re the scientists so and</text>
  <text start="1091.869" dur="5.861">allowed mice to live eight days longer</text>
  <text start="1095.359" dur="4.92">in a hundred and twenty day life cycle</text>
  <text start="1097.73" dur="4.049">our lifetime another study found that</text>
  <text start="1100.279" dur="3.33">average lifespan can increase five to</text>
  <text start="1101.779" dur="4.08">fourteen percent even when starting</text>
  <text start="1103.609" dur="4.41">halfway through the lives of mice the</text>
  <text start="1105.859" dur="4.831">above studies use a derivative of C 60</text>
  <text start="1108.019" dur="5.22">while using actual C 60 and olive oil</text>
  <text start="1110.69" dur="7.469">can get 90 percent increase in lifespan</text>
  <text start="1113.239" dur="9.091">for rats so the the impact difference</text>
  <text start="1118.159" dur="8.7">between taking the the C 60 and take in</text>
  <text start="1122.33" dur="6.689">the C 60 and olive oil is five to</text>
  <text start="1126.859" dur="6.3">fourteen percent versus ninety percent</text>
  <text start="1129.019" dur="6.9">okay so the the oil really helps this</text>
  <text start="1133.159" dur="5.551">stuff get into your system and the oil</text>
  <text start="1135.919" dur="4.14">itself can be good for you obviously you</text>
  <text start="1138.71" dur="4.11">know I talk about this a lot with olive</text>
  <text start="1140.059" dur="5.19">oil about 98 percent of olive oil is BS</text>
  <text start="1142.82" dur="4.26">and it&amp;#39;s probably really bad for you so</text>
  <text start="1145.249" dur="4.471">you really need to do your homework on</text>
  <text start="1147.08" dur="4.62">the industry of olive oil because it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1149.72" dur="3.959">very corrupt industry there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1151.7" dur="5.01">rancid oils there&amp;#39;s a lot of cut oils</text>

  <text start="2191.96" dur="3">where it really becomes affordable and</text>
  <text start="2193.369" dur="3.151">packs a punch right because you don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="2239.7" dur="4.26">enjoy the beneficial effect the rat</text>

  <text start="2246.39" dur="7.38">establishment medicinal properties so</text>
  <text start="2248.82" dur="7.89">it&amp;#39;s like just imagine if you had never</text>

  <text start="2271.41" dur="5.91">for humans and of course with vitamin C</text>
  <text start="2275.16" dur="4.32">you know we&amp;#39;ve it&amp;#39;s basically limitless</text>
  <text start="2277.32" dur="7.23">you can take as much as you want as a</text>
  <text start="2279.48" dur="6.96">human at least and the rat lives okay so</text>
  <text start="2284.55" dur="3.36">we&amp;#39;re trying to poison it to death by</text>
  <text start="2286.44" dur="5.13">giving it tons of this stuff and it</text>
  <text start="2287.91" dur="5.49">lives so that is kind of how you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2291.57" dur="4.76">you&amp;#39;re looking at this okay so C 60 is</text>
  <text start="2293.4" dur="5.43">an interesting comparison alright</text>
  <text start="2296.33" dur="6.49">because it works in a very similar way</text>
  <text start="2298.83" dur="5.16">and that you can take a lot of it so how</text>
  <text start="2302.82" dur="3.03">much do you need to get the health</text>
  <text start="2303.99" dur="4.47">effects probably a lot less than it</text>
  <text start="2305.85" dur="4.38">would take to attempt to kill the rat</text>
  <text start="2308.46" dur="4.38">right they could scale it down a lot and</text>
