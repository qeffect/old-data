  <text start="6.42" dur="4.83">routine and basically I don&amp;#39;t really eat</text>
  <text start="9.45" dur="4.53">a lot of breakfast I generally don&amp;#39;t eat</text>
  <text start="11.25" dur="4.23">anything until around 4:00 p.m. because</text>
  <text start="13.98" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;m trying to get into the intermittent</text>
  <text start="15.48" dur="4.139">fasting thing and only eat with an</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="3.93">eight-hour window every day but this</text>
  <text start="19.619" dur="3.121">video is not about that this video is</text>
  <text start="21.18" dur="5.099">about one of the things that I do in the</text>
  <text start="22.74" dur="6.359">morning sometimes especially when I want</text>
  <text start="26.279" dur="4.981">an extra energy or extra mood boost and</text>
  <text start="29.099" dur="3.931">as many of you have already commented</text>
  <text start="31.26" dur="4.819">you really like some of the stuff I do</text>
  <text start="33.03" dur="4.95">about health videos and I don&amp;#39;t try to</text>
  <text start="36.079" dur="3.341">outdo some of the videos that are</text>
  <text start="37.98" dur="3.45">already out there because these guys</text>
  <text start="39.42" dur="3.75">will break down every single detail and</text>
  <text start="41.43" dur="3.719">everything else but I do try to share</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="4.77">some of my personal choices with you</text>
  <text start="45.149" dur="7.89">so one of the things that I want to talk</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="8.49">about is raw cacao and it comes in this</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="6.211">little nib form these are basically</text>
  <text start="56.43" dur="4.649">crushed up cocoa beans the source of</text>
  <text start="59.25" dur="3.93">chocolate if you&amp;#39;re not familiar already</text>
  <text start="61.079" dur="6.061">I don&amp;#39;t drop any because it&amp;#39;s lethal to</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="5.61">dogs I have one ounce which is about 1/4</text>
  <text start="67.14" dur="5.24">of a cup maybe a little bit more than</text>
  <text start="68.79" dur="6.45">1/4 of a cup this is a 3/4 cup here and</text>
  <text start="72.38" dur="4.989">anything over about an ounce a day can</text>
  <text start="75.24" dur="3.87">give you a migraine so you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="77.369" dur="4.461">go too far with it because this is a</text>
  <text start="79.11" dur="5.16">superfood it&amp;#39;s very potent very powerful</text>
  <text start="81.83" dur="4.179">ancient Mayan Emperor&amp;#39;s would drink cups</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="5.25">of this every day because it actually</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="5.79">has some incredible effects not only the</text>
  <text start="89.52" dur="3.599">flavanol flavonoids or flavanols or</text>
  <text start="91.799" dur="3.451">whatever they&amp;#39;re called the superfood</text>
  <text start="93.119" dur="6.511">affects a lot of the good stuff that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="95.25" dur="7.35">in it including magnesium and such but</text>
  <text start="99.63" dur="5.82">it also has two incredibly important</text>
  <text start="102.6" dur="4.5">effects for two stalee use beyond the</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="3.209">health and then those were those are</text>
  <text start="107.1" dur="5.73">good too you should consider for those</text>
  <text start="108.659" dur="6.061">one it has something called theobromine</text>
  <text start="112.83" dur="4.56">other computer like just booted up after</text>
  <text start="114.72" dur="6.24">like five minutes what the hell</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="8.49">theobromine is similar to caffeine the</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="7.17">stronger and probably a little bit yeah</text>
  <text start="125.88" dur="4.89">a good chunk stronger and when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.13" dur="4.8">taking this much cacao at once you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="130.77" dur="4.59">gonna have a heck of an energy boost and</text>
  <text start="132.93" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little different from</text>
  <text start="135.36" dur="5.76">caffeine in that it will give you a more</text>
  <text start="138.54" dur="3.84">long-lasting and smooth energy ride</text>
  <text start="141.12" dur="7.17">rather than that jittery</text>
  <text start="142.38" dur="8.4">you know caffeine crash and secondly it</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="4.5">puts you in a really good mood everybody</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="3.78">knows that the rumor that chocolate puts</text>
  <text start="152.79" dur="4.62">people in a good mood and ladies like to</text>
  <text start="154.56" dur="6.39">eat chocolate oftentimes to when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="157.41" dur="5.64">sad or something chocolate has just a</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="4.95">tiny tiny fraction of the theobromine</text>
  <text start="163.05" dur="5.19">because it&amp;#39;s so processed even cocoa is</text>
  <text start="165.9" dur="5.28">often processed but cacao is basically</text>
  <text start="168.24" dur="7.5">just the raw food and that&amp;#39;s what I like</text>
  <text start="171.18" dur="9.69">to do I do like to blend it in a food</text>
  <text start="175.74" dur="8.19">processor into a powder and maybe mix it</text>
  <text start="180.87" dur="6.39">into some kind of a smoothie or or</text>
  <text start="183.93" dur="5.34">milkshake or something like that you can</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="4.65">you can play around for flavor sometimes</text>
  <text start="189.27" dur="5.31">I just you know swallow a spoon at a</text>
  <text start="191.91" dur="4.65">time and chase it if I&amp;#39;m in a hurry</text>
  <text start="194.58" dur="3.18">because I&amp;#39;m really going after not the</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="3.29">flavor and I don&amp;#39;t want to add a bunch</text>
  <text start="197.76" dur="5.51">of sugar to it but I&amp;#39;m going after the</text>
  <text start="199.85" dur="5.83">therapeutic effect and the energy boost</text>
  <text start="203.27" dur="4.75">especially if I&amp;#39;ve lately I&amp;#39;ve been on</text>
  <text start="205.68" dur="5.52">caffeine too much trying to keep up with</text>
  <text start="208.02" dur="5.04">this baby so I really don&amp;#39;t like to take</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="6.78">caffeine too often because you start to</text>
  <text start="213.06" dur="7.17">get those those what is it called when</text>
  <text start="217.98" dur="6.99">you have less yield from your results</text>
  <text start="220.23" dur="6.3">each time I don&amp;#39;t remember anyway you</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="4.739">start getting a little bit less out of</text>
  <text start="226.53" dur="5.31">it each time you do caffeine and you</text>
  <text start="229.709" dur="4.921">know it is it&amp;#39;s an addictive drug let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.84" dur="5.93">face it and over time you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="4.55">maintain and when you finally stop</text>
  <text start="237.77" dur="2.88">you are going to crash and you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="3.84">be tired for days and your heart is</text>
  <text start="240.65" dur="6.21">going to be wore out and you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="243.02" dur="6">gonna be kind of exhausted and I try to</text>
  <text start="246.86" dur="4.13">avoid doing caffeine for more than three</text>
  <text start="249.02" dur="5.49">or four days at a time for that reason</text>
  <text start="250.99" dur="7.93">then I&amp;#39;ll take a break to let my my body</text>
  <text start="254.51" dur="6.75">rest on a slower day I think that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="258.92" dur="4.38">basically there are some some risk</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="3.66">factors obviously if you&amp;#39;re sensitive to</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="3.75">caffeine this is gonna be pretty strong</text>
  <text start="264.92" dur="4.38">for you it goes very slowly and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="3.72">take it with caffeine unless you really</text>
  <text start="269.3" dur="2.88">know what you&amp;#39;re doing because obviously</text>
  <text start="270.77" dur="5.07">you don&amp;#39;t wanna be taking that many</text>
  <text start="272.18" dur="5.94">stimulants if you have heart problems</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="3.75">maybe check with a doctor first do your</text>
  <text start="278.12" dur="3.12">own research because this is definitely</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="2.07">not medical advice this is just what I</text>
  <text start="281.24" dur="4.59">do</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="6.57">and theobromine is again poisonous fatal</text>
  <text start="285.83" dur="2.97">to dogs and cats very very very</text>
  <text start="288.23" dur="2.55">dangerous</text>
  <text start="288.8" dur="5.19">I wouldn&amp;#39;t let children have too much of</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="7.05">this either because they&amp;#39;re already wild</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="5.43">and crazy and yeah I think that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="2.94">think that&amp;#39;s most of the stuff there are</text>
  <text start="299.42" dur="2.79">a lot of health benefits and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
