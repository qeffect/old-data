  <text start="40.059" dur="7.201">multiple occasions even under oath and</text>
  <text start="44.26" dur="9.06">worth mentioning I guess he started a</text>
  <text start="47.26" dur="8.52">GoFundMe basically a a campaign to get</text>
  <text start="53.32" dur="4.259">donations from from vans out there</text>

  <text start="62.14" dur="8.31">got in like arrested and indicted for</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="7.091">illegal leaks to the media so he sees</text>
  <text start="70.45" dur="5.49">which way the wind is blowing he got</text>
  <text start="73" dur="5.94">scared and then of course the taxpayers</text>

  <text start="102.61" dur="5.04">to IG Horowitz he&amp;#39;s definitely going</text>
  <text start="105.67" dur="3.33">down I think it&amp;#39;s a fairly safe</text>
  <text start="107.65" dur="6.81">prediction at this point that he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="109" dur="8.1">to face criminal charges soon in the</text>
  <text start="114.46" dur="5.97">economy jobless claims actually fell to</text>
  <text start="117.1" dur="6.15">their lowest levels since 1973 okay that</text>
  <text start="120.43" dur="5.05">is pretty massive and it kind of</text>
  <text start="123.25" dur="5.04">coincides with a</text>
  <text start="125.48" dur="6.36">pretty historical record lows for</text>
  <text start="128.29" dur="5.68">welfare and food stamps things like that</text>
  <text start="131.84" dur="4.23">as well and you know places like West</text>
  <text start="133.97" dur="4.53">Virginia are actually now putting in new</text>
  <text start="136.07" dur="6.06">rules and trying to get new laws passed</text>
  <text start="138.5" dur="6.24">where they can force you to go through a</text>
  <text start="142.13" dur="5.19">lot more scrutiny when trying to get on</text>
  <text start="144.74" dur="5.31">the free government dole things like</text>

  <text start="150.05" dur="3.12">states have different suggestions West</text>
  <text start="151.52" dur="5.73">Virginia says you have to work to be</text>
  <text start="153.17" dur="6.96">able to qualify for it so I think the</text>

  <text start="160.13" dur="6.18">slowly to an end</text>
  <text start="163.3" dur="6.61">Omar Mateen which was the Orlando pulse</text>
  <text start="166.31" dur="5.64">nightclub shooter found his wife was</text>
  <text start="169.91" dur="3.99">found not guilty of involvement and with</text>
  <text start="171.95" dur="5.19">her husband&amp;#39;s terror attack which is</text>
  <text start="173.9" dur="5.43">kind of bogus the only conservative</text>
  <text start="177.14" dur="5.12">journalists present was of course Lara</text>
  <text start="179.33" dur="5.7">Loomer who has more balls than most men</text>

  <text start="196.55" dur="5.07">from an event that should be open to the</text>
  <text start="199.67" dur="6.36">public in general much less open to the</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="7.22">media so it&amp;#39;s kind of telling when they</text>
  <text start="206.03" dur="2.81">do things like this</text>
  <text start="210.97" dur="5.62">Palestinians call a u.s. plan to cut UN</text>
  <text start="213.8" dur="7.14">aid a declaration of war now there is</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="6.119">also some aid to Israel in there so you</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="3.6">know they could kind of call that part a</text>
  <text start="222.709" dur="3.361">declaration of war but they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="4.98">just pissed off about not getting free</text>
  <text start="226.07" dur="6.87">money at this point I mean this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="229.52" dur="4.86">almost a typical lefty response to be</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="2.13">honest you&amp;#39;re not going to give me free</text>
  <text start="234.38" dur="2.34">stuff anymore</text>
  <text start="235.07" dur="4.639">well you&amp;#39;re evil and you hate me and</text>
  <text start="236.72" dur="2.989">you&amp;#39;re trying to kill me right</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="4.23">kind of the biggest news is that</text>
  <text start="244.4" dur="3.67">sessions</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="5.58">attorney general sessions has basically</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="5.7">replied to the letter to House and</text>
  <text start="251.28" dur="3.96">Senate and is saying that he is not</text>
  <text start="253.77" dur="3.66">going to appoint a second special</text>
  <text start="255.24" dur="5.61">counsel of course this pisses off the</text>
  <text start="257.43" dur="6.6">freedom caucus and many of us but he did</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="6.15">at least admit to and reveal that he has</text>
  <text start="264.03" dur="6.27">a high-level prosecutor another Obama</text>
  <text start="267" dur="6.44">appointee working with IG Horowitz and</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="5.55">the prosecutors name is John W Huber</text>
  <text start="273.44" dur="5.89">he&amp;#39;s one of the top state</text>
  <text start="275.85" dur="6.93">I think he&amp;#39;s Utah prosecutors and he is</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="6.48">going to be the I guess the enforcement</text>
  <text start="282.78" dur="8.01">arm of anything Horowitz finds I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="8.64">know if this is a move to like a prelude</text>
  <text start="290.79" dur="5.91">to arrests and prosecutions and trials</text>
  <text start="294.45" dur="3.96">or if it&amp;#39;s just keeping up the</text>
  <text start="296.7" dur="4.5">appearance of doing something in order</text>
  <text start="298.41" dur="5.4">to avoid bringing out a second Special</text>
  <text start="301.2" dur="4.86">Counsel which would be the big guns</text>
  <text start="303.81" dur="3.99">he certainly has had no issue with</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="3.3">conflicts of interests when the Obama</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="4.68">holdovers were appointing a known</text>
  <text start="309.36" dur="5.37">crooked cop Mueller who was best friends</text>
  <text start="312.48" dur="4.37">with Comey and swept under the rug a</text>
  <text start="314.73" dur="4.92">whole bunch of Clinton and Obama</text>
  <text start="316.85" dur="4.81">scandals including email gate fast and</text>
  <text start="319.65" dur="4.29">furious the Clinton Foundation Clinton</text>
  <text start="321.66" dur="3.96">emails uranium one and the IRS scandal</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="3.6">where they were targeting Conservatives</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="6.27">under Lois Lerner who never faced</text>
  <text start="327.54" dur="8.03">justice by the way gateway pundit is</text>
  <text start="331.89" dur="6.39">calling it a constitutional crisis</text>
  <text start="335.57" dur="5.17">they&amp;#39;re also asking what does the deep</text>
  <text start="338.28" dur="5.51">state have on sessions that he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="340.74" dur="3.05">this of he&amp;#39;s acting this way</text>
  <text start="344.31" dur="6.84">and there is a small army of illegals</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="4.529">from mostly Honduras marching right</text>
  <text start="351.15" dur="4.05">through Mexico they have a southern</text>
  <text start="353.639" dur="4.111">border wall and they actually let them</text>
  <text start="355.2" dur="4.35">pass they&amp;#39;re marching straight through</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="3.51">Mexico to the US where they plan to</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="6.15">illegally cross the border or seek</text>
  <text start="361.26" dur="6.57">asylum about 1,500 of them mostly man of</text>
  <text start="365.7" dur="4.11">course but when you see a picture it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.83" dur="3.33">always going to be that one or two of</text>
  <text start="369.81" dur="2.79">the children involved right it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="371.16" dur="3.8">be a woman and a child right at the</text>
  <text start="372.6" dur="4.86">front that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re gonna focus on</text>
  <text start="374.96" dur="3.97">some lefty outlets already have</text>
  <text start="377.46" dur="5.61">journalist embedded in the crowd</text>
  <text start="378.93" dur="5.85">marching with them it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="383.07" dur="3.63">for pulling on the lefty heartstrings</text>
  <text start="384.78" dur="5.1">you know let&amp;#39;s take a picture of that</text>
  <text start="386.7" dur="10.17">one woman and child in a army of 1,500</text>
  <text start="389.88" dur="7.95">men that&amp;#39;s typical of them oh and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="2.91">let&amp;#39;s be frank</text>
  <text start="397.83" dur="4.38">generally when these illegals come and</text>
  <text start="399.78" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;m not even gonna go into the Muslim</text>
  <text start="402.21" dur="3.72">issue at all because that&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="403.53" dur="3.75">entirely mad as well but generally when</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="4.61">these illegals come up from South</text>
  <text start="407.28" dur="7.139">America they will hire kind of an expert</text>
  <text start="410.54" dur="5.53">who&amp;#39;s done it before and generally they</text>
  <text start="414.419" dur="3.721">won&amp;#39;t be able to afford necessarily to</text>
  <text start="416.07" dur="3.51">allow the whole family to go so they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="418.14" dur="2.88">pay for like their children to be able</text>
  <text start="419.58" dur="5.7">to get up there to have a you know a</text>
  <text start="421.02" dur="7.8">quote better life and then of course</text>
  <text start="425.28" dur="5.07">these these experts will often rape the</text>
  <text start="428.82" dur="3.75">women and children to come on these</text>
  <text start="430.35" dur="3.33">things they will half the time they</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="2.52">won&amp;#39;t even get them there that was leave</text>
  <text start="433.68" dur="3.33">them tied to a tree or something where</text>
  <text start="435.09" dur="4.68">they raped them it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s an ugly</text>
  <text start="437.01" dur="4.14">business folks these people just need to</text>
  <text start="439.77" dur="4.85">stay home and make their own countries</text>
  <text start="441.15" dur="3.47">better and not try to come ruin ours</text>
  <text start="445.83" dur="6.46">the illinois&amp;#39;s congressman</text>
  <text start="449.01" dur="6.129">Mike quickly introduces the coffee fee</text>
  <text start="452.29" dur="4.5">act basically saying that anything that</text>
  <text start="455.139" dur="4.021">Trump tweets on his personal Twitter</text>
  <text start="456.79" dur="3.95">should be considered public record</text>
  <text start="459.16" dur="3.69">presidential record and therefore</text>
  <text start="460.74" dur="5.41">shouldn&amp;#39;t be deleted it should be</text>
  <text start="462.85" dur="5.4">recorded now he is not pro Trump but</text>
  <text start="466.15" dur="3.54">this could turn on them maybe maybe it</text>
  <text start="468.25" dur="2.52">would prevent Twitter from censoring</text>
  <text start="469.69" dur="3.29">people that are trying to communicate</text>
  <text start="470.77" dur="6">with Trump on Twitter I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="472.98" dur="5.23">possibly they would be room for putting</text>
  <text start="476.77" dur="3.63">Trump I&amp;#39;ve heard the rumor that if you</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="4.26">put Trump in your tweet they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="480.4" dur="5.01">delete it I don&amp;#39;t I haven&amp;#39;t tested I</text>
  <text start="482.47" dur="5.009">don&amp;#39;t know often you know I&amp;#39;m not very</text>
  <text start="485.41" dur="4.319">good at Twitter anyway so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="487.479" dur="4.111">generally do a lot of my own tweets I</text>
  <text start="489.729" dur="4.231">just repost a lot of stuff that I think</text>
  <text start="491.59" dur="4.579">is interesting but when you do your</text>
  <text start="493.96" dur="4.74">tweets if you if you play with the</text>
  <text start="496.169" dur="4.031">hashtags and you follow the trending</text>
  <text start="498.7" dur="2.85">hashtags and you tweet to the right</text>
  <text start="500.2" dur="3.51">people you can get a lot better results</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="4.44">that way and sometimes you know I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="503.71" dur="3.75">tweet to someone who is kind of known</text>
  <text start="505.99" dur="3.3">and has a big following and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="507.46" dur="5.129">sometimes they&amp;#39;ll retweet me which is</text>
  <text start="509.29" dur="6.059">really cool you know do more of that if</text>
  <text start="512.589" dur="6.421">you&amp;#39;re watching my videos the House</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="5.431">passes a bill forcing lawmakers to pay</text>

  <text start="523.33" dur="4.56">couple feels like a couple weeks but it</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="2.76">actually feels like a couple years at</text>
  <text start="527.89" dur="2.699">this point because news is flying so</text>
  <text start="529.15" dur="5.43">fast but I think it was a couple weeks</text>
  <text start="530.589" dur="5.461">ago lawmakers were shown to have paid</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="4.05">out millions and millions of dollars</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="4.92">this is right around the time Franken</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="4.5">was resigning for sexual deviancy and</text>
  <text start="540.97" dur="4.26">things like that a whole rash of</text>
  <text start="543.13" dur="5.91">Congress people and Senators or getting</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="5.31">in trouble for it and basically the</text>

  <text start="552.39" dur="4.54">harassed you sexually or hey I raped you</text>
  <text start="555.01" dur="4.77">but here&amp;#39;s some taxpayer money just</text>
  <text start="556.93" dur="5.43">don&amp;#39;t talk about it right</text>
  <text start="559.78" dur="4.71">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s pretty much it</text>
  <text start="562.36" dur="3.93">for the day obviously the sessions thing</text>
  <text start="564.49" dur="5.04">and the McCabe thing are the biggies for</text>
  <text start="566.29" dur="5.52">the day I want to reiterate because the</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="3.54">gun thing is still a big issue and I</text>
  <text start="571.81" dur="4.92">think it&amp;#39;s gonna stay a big issue until</text>
  <text start="573.07" dur="5.46">the midterms in which case the Democrats</text>
  <text start="576.73" dur="3.06">are probably gonna realize it was a huge</text>
  <text start="578.53" dur="4.05">mistake and they should never have</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="3.51">brought it up when they lose terribly in</text>
  <text start="582.58" dur="4.47">the polls</text>
  <text start="583.3" dur="5.52">oh but Trump did say and I&amp;#39;ve said this</text>
