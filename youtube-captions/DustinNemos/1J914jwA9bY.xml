  <text start="98.02" dur="3.69">especially when you&amp;#39;re having to split</text>
  <text start="99.819" dur="3.72">videos into two different topics and</text>
  <text start="101.71" dur="3.42">then put one of them somewhere else and</text>

  <text start="115.719" dur="4.14">work for me and so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="117.939" dur="4.591">work for David the producer and and the</text>
  <text start="119.859" dur="4.62">whole team so anyway thank you guys for</text>
  <text start="122.53" dur="5.269">for staring with me through all of that</text>
  <text start="124.479" dur="3.32">and let&amp;#39;s dive in now</text>
  <text start="136.92" dur="8.289">so okay care is setting a goal 30-plus</text>
  <text start="142.569" dur="6.541">people to Congress Muslims of course to</text>
  <text start="145.209" dur="5.401">become dominant now frankly this is</text>
  <text start="149.11" dur="3.15">actually not a new goal they&amp;#39;ve had the</text>
  <text start="150.61" dur="3.989">same goal in the past and and this is a</text>
  <text start="152.26" dur="4.289">fairly common kind of Muslim goal when</text>
  <text start="154.599" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;ve when they have a minority in</text>
  <text start="156.549" dur="3.511">another country they try to get into the</text>
  <text start="158.049" dur="3.871">majority of politics or at least get a</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="3.66">strong foothold in there and then</text>
  <text start="161.92" dur="4.319">suddenly you have rashida Thule vanillin</text>
  <text start="163.72" dur="5.28">omar everywhere right so this is not a</text>
  <text start="166.239" dur="4.53">shock at all you know at one point I</text>
  <text start="169" dur="3.599">will remind people that it was illegal</text>
  <text start="170.769" dur="3.84">for Muslims to hold office in the United</text>
  <text start="172.599" dur="4.89">States I think in Pelosi Pelosi was</text>
  <text start="174.609" dur="4.141">partially behind removing that and of</text>
  <text start="177.489" dur="3.241">course you know you might say well</text>
  <text start="178.75" dur="3.659">that&amp;#39;s discriminatory and stuff but but</text>
  <text start="180.73" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s not discriminatory in this</text>
  <text start="182.409" dur="4.771">situation because it&amp;#39;s not based on a</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="4.709">race it&amp;#39;s based on a faith and that</text>
  <text start="187.18" dur="5.79">faith Sharia law is in direct opposition</text>
  <text start="189.519" dur="7.08">to the Constitution so you can&amp;#39;t have it</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="5.489">both ways you can&amp;#39;t for example protect</text>
  <text start="196.599" dur="3.631">women&amp;#39;s rights and hire people that</text>
  <text start="198.459" dur="4.261">believe women should wear a veil and be</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="4.11">stoned to death or or beaten to death if</text>
  <text start="202.72" dur="3.15">they have been raped and don&amp;#39;t have like</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="2.91">that of the Jillian witnesses I think</text>
  <text start="205.87" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s four witnesses that you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="207.25" dur="4.799">raped or you weren&amp;#39;t really raped so</text>
  <text start="209.62" dur="4.44">things like that now I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="212.049" dur="4.44">bash Muslims in this I think that Islam</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="4.109">has a lot of peaceful people in it just</text>
  <text start="216.489" dur="4.11">like all the other religions but I do</text>
  <text start="218.169" dur="5.16">think that the the structure and the</text>
  <text start="220.599" dur="5.67">history of Sharia itself lends itself to</text>
  <text start="223.329" dur="5.22">an aggressive conquest expansionist sort</text>
  <text start="226.269" dur="4.321">of mentality and that has been the</text>
  <text start="228.549" dur="4.59">history of Islam right so across Europe</text>
  <text start="230.59" dur="4.41">spread spread spread until stopped like</text>
  <text start="233.139" dur="3.091">a like a plague or a virus and then of</text>
  <text start="235" dur="3.359">course all of the wars in the Middle</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="4.5">East between different factions because</text>
  <text start="238.359" dur="3.63">um that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the Middle East right</text>
  <text start="240.73" dur="4.379">it&amp;#39;s always been that way unfortunately</text>
  <text start="241.989" dur="5.191">so I would like to see more Imam of</text>
  <text start="245.109" dur="4.621">peace types out there that are that are</text>
  <text start="247.18" dur="5.73">advocating for a reformation or change</text>
  <text start="249.73" dur="5.009">within the space I&amp;#39;m not bashing Muslims</text>
  <text start="252.91" dur="3.6">at all I certainly don&amp;#39;t think that they</text>
  <text start="254.739" dur="3.511">should be allowed to take office if they</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="4.62">believe in the Sharia law of course</text>
  <text start="258.25" dur="5.159">because that clearly creates a very fast</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="5.19">breakdown of society and the end of</text>
  <text start="263.409" dur="6.361">America but anyway continue</text>
  <text start="266.32" dur="5.37">on also relevant let&amp;#39;s see with you also</text>
  <text start="269.77" dur="4.05">have a lot of your money going to</text>
  <text start="271.69" dur="4.65">foreign aid to Muslim and Arab nations</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="4.95">so we&amp;#39;re actually paying for a lot of</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="3.9">this stuff but the special thing that</text>
  <text start="278.77" dur="3.33">you should note is most of these</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="5.43">billions of dollars that we&amp;#39;re sending</text>
  <text start="282.1" dur="4.92">out to in aid to other countries most of</text>
  <text start="285.67" dur="3.24">these countries especially the Arab</text>
  <text start="287.02" dur="4.02">citizens have an unfavorable view of</text>
  <text start="288.91" dur="3.72">Americans and they still will routinely</text>
  <text start="291.04" dur="4.05">vote against US interests in the United</text>
  <text start="292.63" dur="4.32">in the United Nations despite us paying</text>
  <text start="295.09" dur="3.36">for all this stuff but we&amp;#39;re giving them</text>
  <text start="296.95" dur="3.51">all of this money and most of its going</text>
  <text start="298.45" dur="3.39">to their military or to their police or</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="3.87">to their oppression of their own</text>
  <text start="301.84" dur="4.8">citizens so this is a very disturbing</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="4.29">thing that you know that we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="306.64" dur="5.04">funding this anyway that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="308.62" dur="5.16">good at all now I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="311.68" dur="4.92">this list but I will mention Chiang</text>
  <text start="313.78" dur="5.76">Kyogre of The Young Turks that bastard</text>
  <text start="316.6" dur="5.1">who named his show after the Armenian</text>
  <text start="319.54" dur="3.18">Genocide for those who who are not yet</text>
  <text start="321.7" dur="2.94">familiar with that I&amp;#39;ll give you the</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="4.5">quick version actually have friends who</text>
  <text start="324.64" dur="4.65">Armenian and they&amp;#39;ve told me that the</text>
  <text start="327.22" dur="5.25">personal version as well as their own</text>
  <text start="329.29" dur="7.26">relatives and such so the the quick</text>
  <text start="332.47" dur="8.25">version is that Muslims tried to destroy</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="6.99">the entire Armenian culture right so the</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="4.29">the entire race was basically genocided</text>
  <text start="343.54" dur="3.06">and for the most part they didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="345.01" dur="5.58">them all but they were in there just</text>
  <text start="346.6" dur="6.6">shooting mortars killing children raping</text>
  <text start="350.59" dur="4.92">and killing women just they the most the</text>
  <text start="353.2" dur="4.29">most brutal hellish valor ground that</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="4.41">you could imagine for a period of</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="5.45">decades right so a long period of time</text>
  <text start="359.92" dur="6.45">now that&amp;#39;s what the young turks did now</text>
  <text start="362.94" dur="6.34">fast-forward cheng huber actually named</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="5.01">his show the young turks which is very</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="4.32">disturbing pretty sure his girlfriend</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="3.72">there has a some some armenian and her</text>
  <text start="373.6" dur="3.78">as well so know what that&amp;#39;s about but</text>
  <text start="375.1" dur="5.19">the point here is that jiang cougar is</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="5.01">now running for office where else then</text>
  <text start="380.29" dur="5.04">katie hills vacated seat the one who was</text>
  <text start="382.39" dur="4.89">recently resigned I guess you know</text>
  <text start="385.33" dur="3.15">kicked out of office basically because</text>
  <text start="387.28" dur="3">she was having all of these like</text>
  <text start="388.48" dur="3.15">extramarital threesomes and throuple &amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="390.28" dur="3.36">and everything else in the halls of</text>
  <text start="391.63" dur="4.02">Congress right taking advantage of her</text>
  <text start="393.64" dur="6.15">staff and and all of this other nonsense</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="6.51">and basically sexual</text>
  <text start="399.79" dur="4.92">parties I guess I mean just partying in</text>
  <text start="402.16" dur="4.35">the office of her of her elected</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="4.29">position so it wasn&amp;#39;t a good place to be</text>
  <text start="406.51" dur="4.44">but it&amp;#39;s now that she&amp;#39;s returned back to</text>
  <text start="409" dur="4.11">her constituents they&amp;#39;re giving her like</text>
  <text start="410.95" dur="4.71">a hero&amp;#39;s welcome she&amp;#39;s more popular than</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="4.2">ever and now chinguga or another sexual</text>
  <text start="415.66" dur="3.48">pervert I would say based on some of the</text>
  <text start="417.31" dur="3.06">things that he&amp;#39;s leaked in the past that</text>
  <text start="419.14" dur="3.36">has come out about him and the way he</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="5.67">treats women well now he&amp;#39;s gonna run for</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="5.94">office another Muslim who apparently</text>
  <text start="426.04" dur="4.32">believes in genocide based on what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="428.44" dur="3.66">named to show is now gonna be running</text>
  <text start="430.36" dur="4.47">for Congress so it can&amp;#39;t kind of comes</text>
  <text start="432.1" dur="5.4">right back over to care and how they</text>
  <text start="434.83" dur="3.84">want to become dominant no I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="437.5" dur="2.64">didn&amp;#39;t even want to spend this much time</text>
  <text start="438.67" dur="3">on the Muslim thing for this particular</text>
  <text start="440.14" dur="4.74">topic but while we&amp;#39;re on it I will</text>
  <text start="441.67" dur="5.61">mention places like Sweden rape capital</text>
  <text start="444.88" dur="4.2">of the world 30 percent Muslim now</text>
  <text start="447.28" dur="3.6">because of all of the illegal</text>
  <text start="449.08" dur="3.81">immigration or in their case I guess</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s voluntary just bring them on</text>
  <text start="452.89" dur="6.24">in right because Sweden has been very</text>
  <text start="455.92" dur="4.74">welcoming this is scary and Sweden has</text>
  <text start="459.13" dur="3.54">done for their doomed</text>
  <text start="460.66" dur="4.29">they will never recover it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="462.67" dur="5.25">for them it would it would involve a</text>
  <text start="464.95" dur="5.61">pitched hot Civil War at this point and</text>
  <text start="467.92" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s probably a losing fight for Sweden</text>
  <text start="470.56" dur="3.87">now other countries next to Sweden have</text>
  <text start="472.9" dur="3.09">already shut down their borders because</text>
  <text start="474.43" dur="3.87">of all the bombings and stuff I think it</text>
  <text start="475.99" dur="4.89">was odd was it Denmark I think it was</text>
  <text start="478.3" dur="5.64">anyway you guys are starting to see some</text>
  <text start="480.88" dur="5.58">of them the different points coming</text>
  <text start="483.94" dur="4.74">together to form like a threat met right</text>
  <text start="486.46" dur="5.49">all of these different things happening</text>
  <text start="488.68" dur="4.98">as Muslims intend to encroach upon and</text>
  <text start="491.95" dur="3.66">take over through the voting and and the</text>
  <text start="493.66" dur="3.96">demographics of the breeding processes</text>
  <text start="495.61" dur="4.44">and and the welfare processes like</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="4.5">Canada is giving all illegal immigrants</text>
  <text start="500.05" dur="4.77">50,000 a year income and a free mortgage</text>
  <text start="502.12" dur="4.38">no matter how your credit is so all the</text>
  <text start="504.82" dur="4.38">illegals head north to Canada</text>
  <text start="506.5" dur="5.94">anyway we&amp;#39;ll keep going here corrupt</text>
  <text start="509.2" dur="5.52">judge Amy Berman Jackson refused Roger</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="4.8">stone from raising the argument that</text>
  <text start="514.72" dur="4.56">would have set him free which is of</text>
  <text start="517.24" dur="4.23">course that Russia didn&amp;#39;t hack the damn</text>
  <text start="519.28" dur="4.44">DNC we know that Seth rich did it or</text>
  <text start="521.47" dur="3.63">someone else did it probably Seth rich</text>
  <text start="523.72" dur="3.09">and I think we all know that it was</text>
  <text start="525.1" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s why he was murdered without being</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="4.35">robbed and that&amp;#39;s why all the coverup</text>
  <text start="529.21" dur="2.77">and all the lies from people like where</text>
  <text start="531.16" dur="5.1">they were that</text>
  <text start="531.98" dur="6.719">we know right so you know other than</text>
  <text start="536.26" dur="4.9">other than Seth rich it could have been</text>
  <text start="538.699" dur="5.101">anyone right but the idea was that the</text>

  <text start="568.91" dur="5.46">happened over the Internet ie Russia or</text>
  <text start="572.269" dur="4.26">Russians now what could have happened is</text>

  <text start="1925.17" dur="4.41">well LBJ came in the Democrats came in</text>

  <text start="1939.27" dur="6.12">Society Lyndon Baines Johnson and he</text>
  <text start="1942.29" dur="4.75">created welfare and he destroyed the</text>

  <text start="1947.04" dur="3.99">50 percent fatherlessness in the home I</text>

  <text start="1952.92" dur="3.63">right</text>
  <text start="1954.51" dur="4.41">so they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve tried to replace the</text>

  <text start="1958.92" dur="3.33">that has destroyed a lot of the black</text>
  <text start="1960.45" dur="3.6">population in America have gotten stuck</text>
  <text start="1962.25" dur="4.11">on welfare and stuff people like Kanye</text>
  <text start="1964.05" dur="4.44">are now and not just black population</text>
  <text start="1966.36" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s my brother my mom my sister they</text>
  <text start="1968.49" dur="4.29">were all caught up in that stuff too and</text>
  <text start="1970.23" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re all on that really low-end</text>

  <text start="1974.49" dur="8.01">addicts prostitutes things like that so</text>
  <text start="1979.01" dur="5.32">what is really happening here I think</text>
  <text start="1982.5" dur="4.41">and maybe this is early murmurings maybe</text>
  <text start="1984.33" dur="3.83">this is hopeful thinking Kanye and maybe</text>
  <text start="1986.91" dur="2.66">some of the others I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1988.16" dur="2.85">to see some of the other like black</text>
  <text start="1989.57" dur="3.66">leaders like Candace Owens and stuff</text>
  <text start="1991.01" dur="5.07">really start to promote Jesus right</text>
  <text start="1993.23" dur="4.56">because at one point the black family</text>
  <text start="1996.08" dur="4.83">was stronger than the white family</text>
  <text start="1997.79" dur="5.64">because I think it&amp;#39;s my opinion they had</text>
  <text start="2000.91" dur="5.43">much stronger religious beliefs than the</text>
  <text start="2003.43" dur="4.17">like for the same time period right so</text>
  <text start="2006.34" dur="2.76">we we were already kind of in our</text>
  <text start="2007.6" dur="3.18">decadence phase and then the black</text>
  <text start="2009.1" dur="3.84">family having gone through slavery in a</text>
  <text start="2010.78" dur="3.57">recent historical context they were</text>
  <text start="2012.94" dur="2.97">still a little bit more hardcore a</text>
  <text start="2014.35" dur="3.63">little bit more conservative a little</text>
  <text start="2015.91" dur="5.61">bit more sheltered in a way so they</text>
  <text start="2017.98" dur="4.86">actually had Jesus to a very strong</text>
  <text start="2021.52" dur="3.3">degree in their population they had a</text>
  <text start="2022.84" dur="4.98">very powerful you know Christian base</text>
  <text start="2024.82" dur="5.22">and many black families still do so this</text>
  <text start="2027.82" dur="4.8">could be the thing that replaces the</text>
  <text start="2030.04" dur="4.23">Democrat plantation I think and and</text>
  <text start="2032.62" dur="2.91">maybe I&amp;#39;m just reading too far into it</text>
  <text start="2034.27" dur="3.33">you guys can let me know what you think</text>
  <text start="2035.53" dur="3.39">but to see someone as powerful and is</text>

  <text start="2038.92" dur="5.43">Kanye promoting Jesus tearing down</text>
  <text start="2041.47" dur="4.83">Hollywood all I can think is what is the</text>
  <text start="2044.35" dur="3.3">cultural implications of this long term</text>
  <text start="2046.3" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re gonna have a come-to-jesus</text>
