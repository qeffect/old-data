  <text start="220.31" dur="3.989">sentiment terms so strongly against</text>
  <text start="222.41" dur="3.69">these globalist sellout companies that</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="3.84">are exploiting selling our information</text>

  <text start="253.91" dur="3.859">especially you being around sick people</text>
  <text start="257.799" dur="4.721">especially since so many of those sick</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="7.02">people are flooding into the United</text>
  <text start="262.52" dur="7.05">States we also have Rudy Giuliani</text>

  <text start="269.57" dur="4.44">meal or testimony conspiracy to frame</text>
  <text start="272.03" dur="6.23">Donald Trump jr. began as early as</text>
  <text start="274.01" dur="10.35">December 2015 2015 and was hashed in</text>
  <text start="278.26" dur="8.29">Washington DC now this is very</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="4.049">interesting because we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="286.55" dur="3.75">see the the rollout of the rhetoric</text>
  <text start="288.409" dur="3.59">right is getting stronger we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="4.769">a little bit more</text>
  <text start="291.999" dur="4.75">accusatory with our tone lately aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.069" dur="4.261">we and some of the words that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.749" dur="3.93">choosing to use now even on Fox News</text>
  <text start="299.33" dur="5.489">which is a completely controlled</text>
  <text start="300.679" dur="5.04">opposition network you know they&amp;#39;re no</text>
  <text start="304.819" dur="5.46">friend of Trump</text>
  <text start="305.719" dur="6.15">at all however this is a major thing for</text>
  <text start="310.279" dur="4.41">him just come out and say and of course</text>
  <text start="311.869" dur="4.14">you know he&amp;#39;s fairly well versed in this</text>
  <text start="314.689" dur="4.2">kind of stuff he&amp;#39;s got a very high-level</text>
  <text start="316.009" dur="5.46">position to see from you know he&amp;#39;s got a</text>
  <text start="318.889" dur="4.38">seat right in the front row also Trump</text>
  <text start="321.469" dur="4.02">warns Mueller against lying about</text>
  <text start="323.269" dur="4.68">getting turned down for the job of FBI</text>
  <text start="325.489" dur="5.16">director one day before he was appointed</text>
  <text start="327.949" dur="4.23">special counsel which I only think he</text>
  <text start="330.649" dur="3.93">was qualified to have I don&amp;#39;t think you</text>
  <text start="332.179" dur="7.41">can do that because he had already done</text>
  <text start="334.579" dur="7.08">that anyway it&amp;#39;s very interesting that</text>
  <text start="339.589" dur="3.81">you know he was basically rejected for a</text>
  <text start="341.659" dur="3.87">job and then hired a bunch of anti-trump</text>
  <text start="343.399" dur="4.92">burrs to to waste the country&amp;#39;s money in</text>
  <text start="345.529" dur="4.92">time going through this ridiculous stunt</text>
  <text start="348.319" dur="3.96">but that helped piss everyone off</text>
  <text start="350.449" dur="4.95">against the left and give Trump the</text>
  <text start="352.279" dur="4.88">power and support he has today which i</text>
  <text start="355.399" dur="4.74">think was part of the plan all along</text>
  <text start="357.159" dur="4.6">breaking and stuttering are breaking</text>
  <text start="360.139" dur="3.18">stuttering Mueller and this was really</text>
  <text start="361.759" dur="3.33">bad I watched this he he was really</text>
  <text start="363.319" dur="3.24">stuttering it was really in fact when</text>
  <text start="365.089" dur="4.62">Jim Jordan got a hold of him his hand</text>
  <text start="366.559" dur="5.79">which was visibly trembling Mueller</text>
  <text start="369.709" dur="5.79">failed greatly today he let the</text>
  <text start="372.349" dur="5.57">Democrats down greatly today it was a</text>
  <text start="375.499" dur="5.34">massive victory for our president</text>
  <text start="377.919" dur="4.84">so Mueller says President obstructed</text>
  <text start="380.839" dur="5.011">justice but unable to prove president</text>
  <text start="382.759" dur="4.34">did not commit obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="385.85" dur="6.889">[Music]</text>
  <text start="387.099" dur="8.38">anyway let&amp;#39;s listen director Muller the</text>
  <text start="392.739" dur="4.3">president has repeatedly claimed that</text>
  <text start="395.479" dur="4.321">your report found there was no</text>
  <text start="397.039" dur="5.7">obstruction and that it completely and</text>
  <text start="399.8" dur="5.399">totally exonerated him but that is not</text>
  <text start="402.739" dur="4.5">what your report said is it correct that</text>
  <text start="405.199" dur="4.14">is not what the report says and our</text>
  <text start="407.239" dur="4.74">reading from page two of volume two of</text>
  <text start="409.339" dur="5.88">your report that&amp;#39;s on the screen you</text>
  <text start="411.979" dur="5.37">wrote quote if we had confidence after a</text>
  <text start="415.219" dur="4.59">thorough investigation of the facts that</text>
  <text start="417.349" dur="5.09">the president clearly did not commit</text>
  <text start="419.809" dur="4.731">obstruction of justice we would so state</text>
  <text start="422.439" dur="3.661">based on the facts</text>
  <text start="424.54" dur="3.87">and the applicable legal standards</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="3.78">however we are unable to reach that</text>
  <text start="428.41" dur="3.15">judgment close quote</text>
  <text start="429.88" dur="5.4">now does that say there was no</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="6.66">obstruction no in fact you were actually</text>
  <text start="435.28" dur="4.74">unable to conclude the president did not</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="6.21">commit obstruction of justice is that</text>
  <text start="440.02" dur="9.39">correct well we at the outset determined</text>
  <text start="444.43" dur="9.87">that we when it came to the the</text>
  <text start="449.41" dur="7.11">president&amp;#39;s culpability we needed to we</text>
  <text start="454.3" dur="3.93">mean it we needed to go forward only</text>
  <text start="456.52" dur="4.26">after taking into account the OLC</text>
  <text start="458.23" dur="6.54">opinion that indicated that a president</text>
  <text start="460.78" dur="7.41">a sitting president cannot be indicted</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="6.48">so the report did not conclude that he</text>
  <text start="468.19" dur="5.4">did not commit obstruction of justice is</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="4.62">that correct that is correct and what</text>
  <text start="473.59" dur="5.13">about total exoneration did you actually</text>
  <text start="475.87" dur="5.67">totally exonerate the president no now</text>
  <text start="478.72" dur="4.53">in fact your reports expressly states</text>
  <text start="481.54" dur="4.62">that it does not exonerate the president</text>
  <text start="483.25" dur="5.82">it does and your investigation actually</text>
  <text start="486.16" dur="4.56">found quote multiple acts by the</text>
  <text start="489.07" dur="3.98">president that were capable of exerting</text>
  <text start="490.72" dur="4.83">undue influence over law enforcement</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="4">investigations including the Russian</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="4.13">interference and obstruction</text>
  <text start="497.05" dur="5.58">investigations is that correct correct</text>
  <text start="499.68" dur="5.14">now director Muller can you explain in</text>
  <text start="502.63" dur="4.4">plain terms what that finding means so</text>
  <text start="504.82" dur="7.62">the American people can understand it</text>
  <text start="507.03" dur="11.05">well the finding indicates that the</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="11.039">president was not that the president was</text>
  <text start="518.08" dur="10.14">not a scoping exculpated for the accent</text>
  <text start="523.479" dur="7.411">he allegedly committed in fact you were</text>
  <text start="528.22" dur="4.65">talking about incidents quote in which</text>
  <text start="530.89" dur="4.08">the president sought to use his official</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="4.62">power outside of usual channels unquote</text>
  <text start="534.97" dur="4.35">to observe undue influence over your</text>
  <text start="537.49" dur="4.38">investigations is that right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.32" dur="4.71">correct now am I correct that on page 7</text>
  <text start="541.87" dur="4.53">of volume 2 of your report you wrote</text>
  <text start="544.03" dur="4.11">quote the president became aware that</text>
  <text start="546.4" dur="5.46">his own conduct was being investigated</text>
  <text start="548.14" dur="6.15">in an obstruction of justice inquiry at</text>
  <text start="551.86" dur="5.19">that point the president engaged in the</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="3.72">second phase of conduct involving public</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="3.78">attacks on the</text>

  <text start="567.64" dur="3.03">quote</text>
  <text start="568.24" dur="4.58">so president Trump&amp;#39;s efforts to exert</text>
  <text start="570.67" dur="4.47">undue influence over your investigation</text>
  <text start="572.82" dur="4.33">intensified after the president became</text>
  <text start="575.14" dur="4.32">aware that he personally was being</text>

  <text start="579.46" dur="6.9">that you have in front of you which</text>
  <text start="582.39" dur="6.25">which came from page 7 volume 2 now is</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="3.99">it correct that if you concluded that</text>
  <text start="588.64" dur="3.9">the president committed the crime of</text>

  <text start="599.439" dur="3.36">I just want to bring up how great his</text>
  <text start="601.239" dur="3">memory was there for a second he was</text>
  <text start="602.799" dur="4.58">really sharp and then he goes back to</text>
  <text start="604.239" dur="3.14">being kind of fuddy-duddy</text>
  <text start="608.48" dur="5.64">is it correct that if you had concluded</text>
  <text start="612.079" dur="3.75">that the president committed the crime</text>

  <text start="615.829" dur="7.351">state that in your report or here today</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="7.019">well I would say you I could the</text>
  <text start="623.18" dur="4.64">statement would be that you would not</text>
  <text start="625.279" dur="6.3">indict and you would not indict because</text>

  <text start="631.579" dur="4.081">president excuse me cannot be indicted</text>

  <text start="664.16" dur="4.38">have to look at it but I&amp;#39;m not certain</text>
  <text start="665.75" dur="4.38">that that was the case if the President</text>

  <text start="963.41" dur="5.07">well several contradictory statements</text>
  <text start="965.389" dur="5.281">and Muller completely lost let&amp;#39;s watch a</text>
  <text start="968.48" dur="3.51">little bit of this one mr. chairman just</text>
  <text start="970.67" dur="4.62">recently mr. Muller</text>
  <text start="971.99" dur="6.87">you said mr. Liu was asking you</text>
  <text start="975.29" dur="5.52">questions and mr. Liu&amp;#39;s question I quote</text>
  <text start="978.86" dur="3.93">the reason you didn&amp;#39;t indict the</text>
  <text start="980.81" dur="5.37">president is because of the OLC opinion</text>
  <text start="982.79" dur="6.21">and you answered that is correct</text>
  <text start="986.18" dur="4.829">but that is not what you said in the</text>
  <text start="989" dur="4.829">report and it&amp;#39;s not what you told</text>
  <text start="991.009" dur="5.37">Attorney General bar and in fact in a</text>
  <text start="993.829" dur="6.271">joint statement that you released with</text>
  <text start="996.379" dur="5.88">DOJ on May 29th after your press</text>
  <text start="1000.1" dur="4.049">conference you&amp;#39;re offered your office</text>
  <text start="1002.259" dur="4.291">issued a joint statement with the</text>
  <text start="1004.149" dur="4.38">Department of Justice that said the</text>
  <text start="1006.55" dur="4.409">Attorney General has previously stated</text>
  <text start="1008.529" dur="6.06">that the special counsel repeatedly</text>
  <text start="1010.959" dur="5.88">affirmed that he was not saying that but</text>
  <text start="1014.589" dur="4.651">for the OLC opinion he would have found</text>
  <text start="1016.839" dur="4.92">the president obstructed justice the</text>
  <text start="1019.24" dur="4.56">special counsels report in his statement</text>
  <text start="1021.759" dur="3.78">today made clear that the office</text>
  <text start="1023.8" dur="3.749">concluded it would not reach a</text>
  <text start="1025.539" dur="4.38">determination one way or the other</text>
  <text start="1027.549" dur="5.13">whether the president committed a crime</text>
  <text start="1029.919" dur="5.01">there is no conflict between these</text>
  <text start="1032.679" dur="4.74">statements so mr. Miller do you stand by</text>
  <text start="1034.929" dur="4.831">your joint statement with DOJ that you</text>
  <text start="1037.419" dur="5.25">issued on May 29th as you sit here today</text>
  <text start="1039.76" dur="8.899">I would have to look at it more closely</text>
  <text start="1042.669" dur="10.531">before I was said I agree with it well</text>
  <text start="1048.659" dur="7.24">so I you know my conclusion is that what</text>
  <text start="1053.2" dur="4.62">you told mr. Liu really contradicts what</text>
  <text start="1055.899" dur="2.851">you said in the report and specifically</text>
  <text start="1057.82" dur="3.54">what you said</text>
  <text start="1058.75" dur="5.82">apparently repeatedly to Attorney</text>
  <text start="1061.36" dur="7.59">General bar that and then you issued a</text>
  <text start="1064.57" dur="6.39">joint statement on May 29th saying that</text>
  <text start="1068.95" dur="3.56">the Attorney General has previously</text>
  <text start="1070.96" dur="3.63">stated that the special counsel</text>
  <text start="1072.51" dur="4.899">repeatedly affirmed that he was not</text>
  <text start="1074.59" dur="4.079">saying but for the oil SIA port that we</text>
  <text start="1077.409" dur="3.121">would have found the president of</text>
  <text start="1078.669" dur="3.87">destructive justice so I just say</text>
  <text start="1080.53" dur="4.529">there&amp;#39;s a conflict I do have some more</text>
  <text start="1082.539" dur="5.101">questions mr. Miller there&amp;#39;s been a lot</text>
  <text start="1085.059" dur="4.831">of talk today about firing the Special</text>
  <text start="1087.64" dur="5.789">Counsel and curtailing the investigation</text>
  <text start="1089.89" dur="5.58">were you ever fired mr. Muller</text>
  <text start="1093.429" dur="5.49">were you ever fired a special concert</text>
  <text start="1095.47" dur="5.06">once mr. Medvedev no no where were you</text>
  <text start="1098.919" dur="5.551">allowed to complete your investigation</text>
  <text start="1100.53" dur="6.46">unencumbered yes and in fact you</text>
  <text start="1104.47" dur="5.55">resigned as Special Counsel when you</text>
  <text start="1106.99" dur="7.1">closed up the office and in late May 20</text>
  <text start="1110.02" dur="8.519">2019 is that correct correct Thank You</text>
  <text start="1114.09" dur="6.76">mr. Miller on April 18th the Attorney</text>

  <text start="1145.27" dur="9.899">that raised some issues and that letter</text>
  <text start="1149.049" dur="9.781">speaks for itself but then I I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="1155.169" dur="7.021">how you could could that could be since</text>
  <text start="1158.83" dur="7.29">AG bars letter detailed the principal</text>

  <text start="1660.15" dur="5.88">funny one and I wanted to bring this to</text>
  <text start="1661.59" dur="6.75">point because pollsters obviously you</text>
  <text start="1666.03" dur="4.74">know rigged often you know 99% chance</text>
  <text start="1668.34" dur="4.55">she would win remember however it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1670.77" dur="6.45">probably gonna be a little bit better</text>
  <text start="1672.89" dur="6.13">for the a little bit more accurate you</text>
  <text start="1677.22" dur="5.93">would say for the betting sites right</text>
  <text start="1679.02" dur="8.76">the places where people are basically</text>
  <text start="1683.15" dur="7.48">gambling so if they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="1687.78" dur="3.99">really gambling you&amp;#39;re gonna see a lot</text>
  <text start="1690.63" dur="3.3">of people that are gonna put their money</text>
  <text start="1691.77" dur="3.39">where their faith is not where they</text>
  <text start="1693.93" dur="4.8">think it&amp;#39;s gonna lose even if their</text>
  <text start="1695.16" dur="7.41">public sentiment is something along the</text>
  <text start="1698.73" dur="8.46">lines of no way he could win they might</text>
  <text start="1702.57" dur="9.51">still bet on him with money anyway so we</text>
  <text start="1707.19" dur="7.11">also have CNN bewildered by Mueller</text>
  <text start="1712.08" dur="6.72">being unfamiliar with key parts of the</text>
  <text start="1714.3" dur="7.08">investigation also quote from POTUS</text>
  <text start="1718.8" dur="5.49">himself Trump saying hope he doesn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="1721.38" dur="4.409">that under oath so Trump calls out</text>
  <text start="1724.29" dur="4.099">Muller for lying about applying</text>
  <text start="1725.789" dur="6.181">for FBI job we have numerous witnesses</text>
  <text start="1728.389" dur="6.071">that is lying he just gotten in trouble</text>
  <text start="1731.97" dur="5.569">for it so now Muller himself is gonna be</text>
  <text start="1734.46" dur="6.329">in the hot seat looking at trouble</text>
  <text start="1737.539" dur="6.22">so also Trump&amp;#39;s personal lawyer Jay</text>

  <text start="1753.69" dur="4.949">that&amp;#39;s funny and we also have Miller</text>

  <text start="1758.639" dur="3.48">tipped off CNN about Roger stolen right</text>
  <text start="1760.859" dur="3.81">of course they did</text>
  <text start="1762.119" dur="4.14">of course it makes complete sense that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1764.669" dur="3.33">why CNN was waiting outside the house</text>
  <text start="1766.259" dur="3.78">for like an hour remember I showed the</text>
  <text start="1767.999" dur="3.6">video he was waiting outside the house</text>
  <text start="1770.039" dur="4.291">actually I think it was multiple hours</text>
  <text start="1771.599" dur="4.591">before police even showed up and then he</text>
  <text start="1774.33" dur="3.599">pulled out his camera and and got to</text>
  <text start="1776.19" dur="3.539">work and I think he even shook their</text>
  <text start="1777.929" dur="4.56">hands or something like that and kind of</text>
  <text start="1779.729" dur="4.16">just prepped with him you know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1782.489" dur="5.25">like he was really there just</text>
  <text start="1783.889" dur="6.4">psychically now we also have DOJ saying</text>

  <text start="2114.33" dur="3.87">his 80s or Nike was actually in his 90s</text>
  <text start="2116.61" dur="4.17">he was still playing like a sort of a</text>
  <text start="2118.2" dur="3.67">not quite as aggressive as he was</text>
  <text start="2120.78" dur="3.16">earlier kind of an</text>
  <text start="2121.87" dur="4.2">an older folks version of the game but</text>
  <text start="2123.94" dur="3.74">he was still playing home every was</text>
  <text start="2126.07" dur="4.02">called something a little bit more</text>

  <text start="2130.09" dur="3.42">he&amp;#39;s been playing like tennis things</text>
  <text start="2132.01" dur="5.34">like that his whole life and he was</text>
  <text start="2133.51" dur="5.52">playing this game and it&amp;#39;s Mindi&amp;#39;s right</text>

  <text start="2142.6" dur="3.45">which usually wipes her energy on makes</text>
  <text start="2144.31" dur="4.23">you feel like crap he was still playing</text>
  <text start="2146.05" dur="4.8">the game barely got a headache</text>
  <text start="2148.54" dur="5.7">one gentleman shared with us on the show</text>
  <text start="2150.85" dur="6.33">that he quadrupled or more his stem cell</text>
  <text start="2154.24" dur="5.1">count in his II think 80s as well you</text>
  <text start="2157.18" dur="4.53">know in his in his his belly fat you can</text>
  <text start="2159.34" dur="5.64">get your own adult stem cells at least</text>

  <text start="2182.52" dur="5.56">half a million or something ridiculous</text>
  <text start="2185.19" dur="5.1">so we can get getting on a tangent here</text>
  <text start="2188.08" dur="5.04">a little bit but you&amp;#39;ve seen my point</text>
  <text start="2190.29" dur="5.38">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things definitely going</text>

  <text start="2211.66" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s pretty incredible and these are</text>
  <text start="2213.91" dur="4.89">these are rats that were born to die on</text>
  <text start="2215.74" dur="4.32">a certain week or so maybe day of tumors</text>
