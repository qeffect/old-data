  <text start="636.589" dur="3.591">making the videos I don&amp;#39;t know if people</text>

  <text start="681.879" dur="3.791">you know I would even wear like a</text>

  <text start="828.32" dur="3.9">around since the beginning of the queue</text>
  <text start="829.61" dur="4.62">movement I&amp;#39;ve been trying to like</text>
  <text start="832.22" dur="4.29">everyone else fight fake news basically</text>
  <text start="834.23" dur="5.91">and tell the truth and expose corruption</text>
  <text start="836.51" dur="6.24">and help our president and in that time</text>
  <text start="840.14" dur="4.08">having been through a couple of these I</text>
  <text start="842.75" dur="2.61">mean having been through everything that</text>
  <text start="844.22" dur="3.18">all the independent media are going</text>
  <text start="845.36" dur="5.76">through personally like censorship and</text>
  <text start="847.4" dur="7.53">the algorithm and D monetization and</text>
  <text start="851.12" dur="6.63">shadow banning and D boosting an actual</text>
  <text start="854.93" dur="5.22">banning you know when I had 50,000</text>
  <text start="857.75" dur="4.589">subscribers I was banned the first</text>
  <text start="860.15" dur="4.41">channel just for telling the truth and</text>
  <text start="862.339" dur="5.821">you know I that was right before my</text>
  <text start="864.56" dur="5.88">first born was do so you know she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="868.16" dur="4.02">almost 2 years old now but I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="870.44" dur="4.8">what to do because that was our in</text>
  <text start="872.18" dur="4.71">common and we were full-time and there</text>
  <text start="875.24" dur="3.36">goes my business because YouTube and me</text>
  <text start="876.89" dur="5.97">so things like this and the censorship</text>
  <text start="878.6" dur="6.54">has been something I felt very keenly</text>
  <text start="882.86" dur="4.86">myself and other independent media are</text>
  <text start="885.14" dur="6.21">being impacted by it sometimes even</text>
  <text start="887.72" dur="5.28">worse than me so you know having dealt</text>
  <text start="891.35" dur="4.65">with censorship and having dealt with</text>
  <text start="893" dur="6.48">the attack on your livelihood and your</text>
  <text start="896" dur="5.82">families you know resources for telling</text>
  <text start="899.48" dur="4.17">the truth I set out to solve a couple of</text>
  <text start="901.82" dur="5.25">problems and that&amp;#39;s kind of what segues</text>
  <text start="903.65" dur="5.73">me to my point we started a movement and</text>
  <text start="907.07" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s growing and it&amp;#39;s actually really</text>
  <text start="909.38" dur="4.56">exciting to be part of that and you know</text>
  <text start="911.24" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s tripled in three months so every</text>
  <text start="913.94" dur="4.17">month it exponentially doubles and I</text>
  <text start="916.49" dur="4.349">hope that continues we&amp;#39;ll see how it</text>
  <text start="918.11" dur="4.979">goes but so far there&amp;#39;s about a hundred</text>
  <text start="920.839" dur="4.44">to 200 different content creators</text>
  <text start="923.089" dur="4.321">involved in a conversation to end</text>
  <text start="925.279" dur="3.571">censorship you know even if it means</text>
  <text start="927.41" dur="4.049">that we have to have a class-action</text>
  <text start="928.85" dur="4.95">lawsuit involved in that conversation</text>
  <text start="931.459" dur="5.281">includes whistleblowers and</text>
  <text start="933.8" dur="4.77">Super Lawyers things like that so you</text>
  <text start="936.74" dur="4.62">know people that you would not be</text>
  <text start="938.57" dur="5.04">surprised to see on Fox News even so</text>
  <text start="941.36" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re at that point I really want to ask</text>
  <text start="943.61" dur="4.62">everyone&amp;#39;s help to get the word out</text>
  <text start="945.47" dur="5.25">about you know the movement to end</text>
  <text start="948.23" dur="4.89">digital censorship which is to stop the</text>
  <text start="950.72" dur="5.91">digital book burning or bit burning so</text>
  <text start="953.12" dur="4.92">stop bit burning calm and you know</text>
  <text start="956.63" dur="3.209">especially to tell other content</text>
  <text start="958.04" dur="3.75">creators because that&amp;#39;s kind of where</text>
  <text start="959.839" dur="3.69">we&amp;#39;re at now is just letting them know</text>
  <text start="961.79" dur="3.299">there is hope there is someone that can</text>
  <text start="963.529" dur="3.3">maybe at least there&amp;#39;s a place that you</text>
  <text start="965.089" dur="3.361">can have a conversation and maybe if</text>
  <text start="966.829" dur="4.171">they ban you we can can help get the</text>
  <text start="968.45" dur="5.31">word out or something but at least we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="971" dur="3.99">standing and we&amp;#39;re taking it we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="973.76" dur="4.769">taking a stand and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="974.99" dur="5.7">important and thank you caffeine yeah if</text>
  <text start="978.529" dur="4.021">you want to buy the cue book that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="980.69" dur="4.019">centered by Amazon and I think they</text>
  <text start="982.55" dur="5.279">actually recently dropped some more of</text>
  <text start="984.709" dur="4.801">our verified reviews down because we had</text>
  <text start="987.829" dur="3.241">topped 800 and now we&amp;#39;re back down under</text>
  <text start="989.51" dur="4.53">800 again so I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="991.07" dur="6.3">on but we we triggered the media and set</text>
  <text start="994.04" dur="5.01">off the Amazon algorithms as well so the</text>
  <text start="997.37" dur="5.1">book of queuing I&amp;#39;m calm is a good place</text>
  <text start="999.05" dur="5.9">to buy the cue book anyway so stop it</text>
  <text start="1002.47" dur="5.97">burning was to try to stop censorship</text>
  <text start="1004.95" dur="4.99">there was a second sister movement and</text>
  <text start="1008.44" dur="3.03">most of you have heard of stop it</text>
  <text start="1009.94" dur="3.45">burning by now if you&amp;#39;ve been around my</text>
  <text start="1011.47" dur="3.78">show I won&amp;#39;t shut up about it because</text>
  <text start="1013.39" dur="5.1">I&amp;#39;m tired of being censored and seeing</text>
  <text start="1015.25" dur="5.339">other people censored few of you have</text>
  <text start="1018.49" dur="5.039">heard me talk a lot about the white hat</text>
  <text start="1020.589" dur="4.801">movement which is a similar sister</text>
  <text start="1023.529" dur="4.381">movement instead of going after</text>
  <text start="1025.39" dur="5.789">censorship we&amp;#39;re trying to deal with D</text>
  <text start="1027.91" dur="5.22">monetization I don&amp;#39;t want to see other</text>
  <text start="1031.179" dur="3.99">people go through what I went through</text>
  <text start="1033.13" dur="4.289">where they&amp;#39;re not sure how to pay their</text>
  <text start="1035.169" dur="4.14">bills next month whereas before they</text>
  <text start="1037.419" dur="3.691">were successful independent media</text>
  <text start="1039.309" dur="3.12">figures all because someone at YouTube</text>
  <text start="1041.11" dur="5.01">decided that they were not going to be</text>
  <text start="1042.429" dur="5.971">allowed to make money anymore so that is</text>
  <text start="1046.12" dur="3.809">very dangerous to freedom and when</text>
  <text start="1048.4" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re allowed to destroy people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1049.929" dur="5.211">livelihoods it makes it&amp;#39;s a chilling</text>
  <text start="1052.99" dur="4.8">effect it makes it almost impossible to</text>
  <text start="1055.14" dur="4.45">to get truth out it makes it hard to</text>
  <text start="1057.79" dur="3.78">even take a chance to tell the truth</text>
  <text start="1059.59" dur="5.49">right because they&amp;#39;ll come after your</text>
  <text start="1061.57" dur="5.46">bank account or something so the point</text>
  <text start="1065.08" dur="2.4">that I&amp;#39;m getting to is that in synergy</text>
  <text start="1067.03" dur="2.85">with</text>
  <text start="1067.48" dur="4.59">stop it burning and potential lawsuit to</text>
  <text start="1069.88" dur="4.74">stop censorship against big tank we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1072.07" dur="5.55">also going to be building a coalition or</text>
  <text start="1074.62" dur="4.89">a marketplace of Patriot owned</text>
  <text start="1077.62" dur="4.98">businesses and businesses that support</text>
  <text start="1079.51" dur="5.37">freedom of speech and basically here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1082.6" dur="4.14">my pitch if you&amp;#39;re a business that</text>
  <text start="1084.88" dur="4.77">supports freedom of speech I would like</text>
  <text start="1086.74" dur="5.04">to help sell your products and I have a</text>
  <text start="1089.65" dur="4.59">big audience and that way I can fund my</text>
  <text start="1091.78" dur="5">work and I can support my values by</text>
  <text start="1094.24" dur="6.09">shopping Patriot or shopping white hat</text>
  <text start="1096.78" dur="5.35">so I want to pair that with other</text>
  <text start="1100.33" dur="3.9">youtube channels as well because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1102.13" dur="3.75">already starting to do that with helping</text>
  <text start="1104.23" dur="6.81">to fund other channels that are being</text>
  <text start="1105.88" dur="7.41">demonetised and I&amp;#39;m want to pair that in</text>
  <text start="1111.04" dur="6.33">a way that will fund independent media</text>
  <text start="1113.29" dur="6.33">in a big way all over the place by by</text>
  <text start="1117.37" dur="5.25">introducing them to Patriot businesses</text>
  <text start="1119.62" dur="6.66">so kind of a alternative marketplace to</text>
  <text start="1122.62" dur="7.08">the globalists monopolies that we have</text>
  <text start="1126.28" dur="6.75">now like a big tank so we&amp;#39;re building</text>
  <text start="1129.7" dur="5.25">that ecosystem right now in fact for</text>
  <text start="1133.03" dur="4.29">those who are interested in and being</text>
  <text start="1134.95" dur="4.74">part of that either as a business or as</text>
  <text start="1137.32" dur="5.489">a shopper you can sign up as at white</text>
  <text start="1139.69" dur="5.43">hat movement com if you want to help</text>
  <text start="1142.809" dur="6.211">support us against censorship stop bit</text>
  <text start="1145.12" dur="5.97">burning calm and hopefully in January</text>
  <text start="1149.02" dur="4.17">I&amp;#39;ve talked to you guys about magazine</text>
  <text start="1151.09" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s part of the white hat movement</text>
  <text start="1153.19" dur="6.69">concept it&amp;#39;s an alternative to Amazon</text>
  <text start="1156.1" dur="6.99">for Patriots that&amp;#39;s coming soon in</text>
  <text start="1159.88" dur="7.049">January so you know big things ahead</text>

  <text start="1166.929" dur="5.911">I&amp;#39;m kind of envisioning a supercharged</text>
  <text start="1168.52" dur="5.61">of independent media anyway that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1172.84" dur="4.41">kind of out of breath now after that</text>
  <text start="1174.13" dur="6.45">long monologue I don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="1177.25" dur="4.95">time-traveling queue but it looks like</text>
  <text start="1180.58" dur="7.44">he can see into the future sometimes for</text>

  <text start="1476.85" dur="5.04">just not gonna go through the trouble</text>
  <text start="1478.02" dur="5.94">and that&amp;#39;s a legitimate way of canceling</text>

  <text start="1483.96" dur="2.75">the vote right</text>
  <text start="1484.65" dur="4.35">hopefully they&amp;#39;ll all run out here</text>

  <text start="1498.81" dur="7.56">that so you know we&amp;#39;ll see what happens</text>
  <text start="1502.59" dur="5.58">but California I think it&amp;#39;s a look not a</text>
  <text start="1506.37" dur="3.75">lost cause long term but a lost cause a</text>
  <text start="1508.17" dur="3.72">short term you know if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1585.34" dur="4.41">fund a lawsuit against Google either I</text>
  <text start="1587.53" dur="3.84">would have to have that where we go when</text>
  <text start="1589.75" dur="3.54">we go all you know we would have to have</text>
  <text start="1591.37" dur="3.32">hundreds of youtubers and hundreds of</text>

  <text start="1614.67" dur="5.11">slandered me and lied and stuff I looked</text>
  <text start="1617.47" dur="3.96">into him a little bit more and other</text>

  <text start="1621.43" dur="3.9">organize Q conferences and the media or</text>
  <text start="1623.71" dur="4.59">like mainstream media are trying to link</text>
  <text start="1625.33" dur="5.07">him to us the Q movement which is really</text>
  <text start="1628.3" dur="4.26">like scary because he&amp;#39;s he seems like</text>
  <text start="1630.4" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s unstable and and with what I looked</text>
  <text start="1632.56" dur="4.38">into I just feel like that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1635.11" dur="4.35">something you should sue that&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="1636.94" dur="6.12">like something that you should like you</text>

  <text start="1645.43" dur="4.53">he&amp;#39;s mentally unstable and and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1647.2" dur="4.92">evidence quite a bit by the videos that</text>

  <text start="2439.749" dur="3.51">a few questions I&amp;#39;m missing</text>
  <text start="2441.069" dur="4.891">apparently why did the globalists</text>
  <text start="2443.259" dur="4.681">believe in cannibalism so not all of</text>
  <text start="2445.96" dur="5.7">them do I mean globalism is more of a</text>
  <text start="2447.94" dur="7.01">communist idea but some of the elite do</text>
  <text start="2451.66" dur="5.25">you practice you know some cult</text>
  <text start="2454.95" dur="4.059">traditions that have been handed down in</text>
  <text start="2456.91" dur="4.579">some cases through the family bloodlines</text>
  <text start="2459.009" dur="5.131">for hundreds of years so there you know</text>
  <text start="2461.489" dur="5.02">people know about like the the Masons</text>
  <text start="2464.14" dur="4.139">and stuff but there&amp;#39;s religions that are</text>
  <text start="2466.509" dur="5.78">out there besides the ones that you know</text>
  <text start="2468.279" dur="7.26">about their dark and based on sacrifice</text>
  <text start="2472.289" dur="6.131">a lot of the Hebrew religions were based</text>
  <text start="2475.539" dur="4.441">on sacrifice so it&amp;#39;s not so unheard of</text>
  <text start="2478.42" dur="3.839">out there but people just assume that</text>
  <text start="2479.98" dur="4.92">you know no that doesn&amp;#39;t go on in the</text>
  <text start="2482.259" dur="4.59">year 2019 right that kind of stuff is</text>
  <text start="2484.9" dur="5.129">for the old era but that&amp;#39;s not always</text>
  <text start="2486.849" dur="6.27">true you know some cultures still have</text>
  <text start="2490.029" dur="4.56">animal sacrifice and some darker</text>
  <text start="2493.119" dur="4.081">cultures believe that there&amp;#39;s more power</text>
  <text start="2494.589" dur="5.311">and human sacrifice and in some cases</text>
  <text start="2497.2" dur="4.799">some cultures also believe that for</text>
  <text start="2499.9" dur="3.629">example you can consume the power of</text>
  <text start="2501.999" dur="4.59">others by eating them things like that</text>
  <text start="2503.529" dur="5.81">so there&amp;#39;s a lot that goes into that in</text>
  <text start="2506.589" dur="5.551">the case of some of these high-level</text>
  <text start="2509.339" dur="4.331">evil people it&amp;#39;s mostly blackmail but</text>
  <text start="2512.14" dur="3.659">there is some cult stuff to it at the</text>
  <text start="2513.67" dur="3.449">highest levels - and that&amp;#39;s where they</text>
  <text start="2515.799" dur="5.01">draw a lot of their inspiration from</text>
  <text start="2517.119" dur="6.72">because at the end of the day the best</text>
  <text start="2520.809" dur="5.22">mind control comes with a system you</text>
  <text start="2523.839" dur="4.17">know it&amp;#39;s not just about blackmailing</text>
  <text start="2526.029" dur="3.78">everyone for power there&amp;#39;s a call at the</text>
  <text start="2528.009" dur="3.6">higher level so that you need a mind</text>
  <text start="2529.809" dur="4.7">control system for your actual cult</text>
  <text start="2531.609" dur="5.071">devotees and one of the best ways to</text>
  <text start="2534.509" dur="4.411">develop that kind of stuff is with</text>
  <text start="2536.68" dur="4.26">symbolism and traditions and and</text>
  <text start="2538.92" dur="6.04">ceremonies and things because that has</text>
  <text start="2540.94" dur="5.069">power for the subconscious mind do you</text>
  <text start="2544.96" dur="6.059">think the first arrests will happen</text>
  <text start="2546.009" dur="6.75">before 2020 um I did I did think the</text>
  <text start="2551.019" dur="2.191">first arrest would happen before 2020</text>
  <text start="2552.759" dur="2.76">inator</text>
  <text start="2553.21" dur="3.99">you know Nader was a big arrest and that</text>
  <text start="2555.519" dur="4.23">leads directly to Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="2557.2" dur="4.859">others in the DNC a lot of funding</text>
  <text start="2559.749" dur="4.651">that&amp;#39;s going illegally to the DNC and it</text>
  <text start="2562.059" dur="3.511">leads to Mueller and his team and their</text>
  <text start="2564.4" dur="3.72">sources and select</text>
  <text start="2565.57" dur="4.92">so Nader is a big arrest and that just</text>
  <text start="2568.12" dur="5.1">happened so you know other than Nader</text>
  <text start="2570.49" dur="4.56">Jorge Nader then yeah I expected there</text>
  <text start="2573.22" dur="5.58">to be something like a mccabe or a Comey</text>
  <text start="2575.05" dur="5.58">but that&amp;#39;s obviously gonna happen and</text>
  <text start="2578.8" dur="3.72">that was my backup option right that was</text>
  <text start="2580.63" dur="3.27">well if they&amp;#39;re not arrested it was</text>
  <text start="2582.52" dur="3.48">going to be something that would be very</text>
  <text start="2583.9" dur="4.35">obvious that it&amp;#39;s coming and I think</text>
  <text start="2586" dur="8.85">it&amp;#39;s now very obvious that McCabe and</text>
  <text start="2588.25" dur="7.89">call me are gonna go to jail you have to</text>
  <text start="2594.85" dur="2.79">look at the facts you have to look at</text>
  <text start="2596.14" dur="2.94">what&amp;#39;s hit the mainstream you have to</text>

  <text start="2601.66" dur="3.18">saying and then what Trump is tweeting</text>
  <text start="2602.98" dur="3.99">and then you have to consider that you</text>
  <text start="2604.84" dur="4.59">have to ignore some of the fake news</text>
  <text start="2606.97" dur="4.17">stuff and and some of them like letting</text>

  <text start="3143.93" dur="5.76">front reason no I think what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="3146.78" dur="5.79">is Hillary&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s hinting at it because</text>
  <text start="3149.69" dur="4.47">if she were to get arrested or or</text>
  <text start="3152.57" dur="3.21">charged with something right now she</text>
  <text start="3154.16" dur="3.39">would then immediately say I&amp;#39;m running</text>
  <text start="3155.78" dur="4.62">for president and try to hide behind</text>
  <text start="3157.55" dur="4.83">that until 2020 and it would work</text>

  <text start="3168.47" dur="4.71">to do now</text>
  <text start="3169.3" dur="6.61">however after 2020 I think even Hillary</text>
  <text start="3173.18" dur="4.77">can get arrested and Obama does not have</text>
  <text start="3175.91" dur="7.86">that protection right now so Obama may</text>
  <text start="3177.95" dur="6.51">go down before Hillary I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="3183.77" dur="2.46">surprised</text>

  <text start="3225.95" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s gonna be resisted but if you</text>
  <text start="3228.62" dur="3.33">breadcrumb them it&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="3230.27" dur="4.77">strategy and it&amp;#39;s a different technique</text>
  <text start="3231.95" dur="5.43">and it works a lot differently and that</text>
  <text start="3235.04" dur="5.16">is that is the critical difference that</text>
  <text start="3237.38" dur="5.22">most anons most Magga people most</text>

  <text start="3254.63" dur="4.17">debating and I used to do a lot of</text>
  <text start="3256.22" dur="4.92">debating so I&amp;#39;m used to the form of an</text>
  <text start="3258.8" dur="4.23">argument in a polite way but for most</text>
  <text start="3261.14" dur="7.26">people the word argument invokes</text>
  <text start="3263.03" dur="8.85">feelings I would say of you know anger</text>
  <text start="3268.4" dur="6.06">or defensiveness or something other than</text>
  <text start="3271.88" dur="9.06">you know educational and and fun and</text>
  <text start="3274.46" dur="8.82">learning so yeah he is missing a piece</text>
