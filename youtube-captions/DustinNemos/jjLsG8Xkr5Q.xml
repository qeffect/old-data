  <text start="361.88" dur="3.42">different pieces of Biden&amp;#39;s corruption</text>
  <text start="363.65" dur="3.24">especially that of his son who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="365.3" dur="4.53">little bit sloppier about it and easier</text>
  <text start="366.89" dur="4.32">to catch out to the public in one video</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="3.72">it would take forever</text>

  <text start="385.55" dur="3.33">language</text>
  <text start="385.94" dur="5.97">so hunter Biden is a weak link in the</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="5.13">chain he&amp;#39;s gonna lead down daddy Biden</text>
  <text start="391.91" dur="3.42">and daddy Biden is the weak link in the</text>
  <text start="394.01" dur="3.45">chain for some of those higher-level</text>
  <text start="395.33" dur="4.35">corrupt people that are still out there</text>
  <text start="397.46" dur="5.1">you know you would think that by now</text>
  <text start="399.68" dur="5.52">Biden would want to retire and enjoy his</text>
  <text start="402.56" dur="4.83">corruption not fight so hard to try to</text>
  <text start="405.2" dur="4.02">become president and beat Trump because</text>
  <text start="407.39" dur="4.43">he&amp;#39;s trying to protect himself from</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="5.58">what&amp;#39;s coming this is self-preservation</text>
  <text start="411.82" dur="4.39">not this is not just greed and power and</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="3.21">corruption they&amp;#39;re not trying to fight</text>

  <text start="418.01" dur="3.27">camera all the time</text>
  <text start="418.82" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re scared they&amp;#39;re reacting they</text>
  <text start="421.28" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t know what to do except try</text>
  <text start="422.63" dur="4.23">everything they can to beat him and I</text>
  <text start="425.09" dur="4.829">guess Biden is just their best candidate</text>
  <text start="426.86" dur="3.45">now to be fair it seems like Obama is</text>
  <text start="429.919" dur="2.641">actually</text>
  <text start="430.31" dur="4.77">telling a lot of his former staff many</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="3.78">of them have now endorsed Warren you</text>
  <text start="435.08" dur="2.73">know when Obama seems to be leaning</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="3.9">toward women would that women are better</text>
  <text start="437.81" dur="4.2">than men comment so you know maybe he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.24" dur="3.57">gonna surprise us with Hillary or</text>
  <text start="442.01" dur="4.65">Michelle but it certainly seems to be</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="5.04">Elizabeth Warren for now now we also</text>
  <text start="446.66" dur="3.87">have more corruption from Hunter even</text>
  <text start="448.85" dur="3.96">though he&amp;#39;s pretending he has no job and</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="4.2">no income and a bunch of debt which may</text>
  <text start="452.81" dur="6.24">all be true technically he&amp;#39;s still a</text>
  <text start="454.73" dur="7.5">super wealthy corrupt liar the stripper</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="5.7">/ probable prostitute if we&amp;#39;re going off</text>
  <text start="462.23" dur="4.71">of the math and the odds here you know</text>
  <text start="464.75" dur="5.34">she did get impregnated with his child</text>
  <text start="466.94" dur="4.86">as a stripper you know and we know what</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="3.45">he likes to do in these strip clubs with</text>
  <text start="471.8" dur="3.78">with sex toys and drugs and everything</text>
  <text start="473.54" dur="3.87">else and folks it&amp;#39;s pretty common in</text>
  <text start="475.58" dur="3.33">strip clubs I imagine anyway that</text>
  <text start="477.41" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re gonna be doing some stuff in the</text>
  <text start="478.91" dur="4.11">back room because you know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="481.19" dur="3.81">gonna strip for money then it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="483.02" dur="4.29">much further to do the rest for it right</text>
  <text start="485" dur="4.08">so you know just one step further to</text>
  <text start="487.31" dur="4.59">make 10 times more money to just sleep</text>
  <text start="489.08" dur="4.71">with someone I guess anyway so he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="491.9" dur="5.07">there doing things like this and then in</text>
  <text start="493.79" dur="5.7">the court case one of his baby mamas was</text>
  <text start="496.97" dur="5.4">a stripper and excuse me as I said</text>
  <text start="499.49" dur="5.48">probable prostitute in a situation wants</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="5.7">to take him to court for child support</text>
  <text start="504.97" dur="4.99">so he&amp;#39;s going through the the already</text>
  <text start="508.07" dur="4.56">rigged child support court system which</text>
  <text start="509.96" dur="5.34">is probably gonna like usually favor the</text>
  <text start="512.63" dur="5.64">female not always but usually favors the</text>
  <text start="515.3" dur="5.73">female even even to the point where I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="4.95">seen in some odds where the woman will</text>
  <text start="521.03" dur="2.67">get the custody even if she&amp;#39;s a drug</text>
  <text start="523.22" dur="2.94">addict</text>
  <text start="523.7" dur="5.13">who&amp;#39;s really on drugs I actually knew a</text>
  <text start="526.16" dur="4.11">girl from high school a little sister of</text>
  <text start="528.83" dur="3.9">a friend who got into drugs and</text>
  <text start="530.27" dur="4.44">eventually her and her boyfriend od&amp;#39;d in</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="4.26">a car with their babies in the backseat</text>
  <text start="534.71" dur="4.71">I think they had three babies and they</text>
  <text start="536.99" dur="4.71">were just found dead you know things</text>
  <text start="539.42" dur="4.38">like that anyway so I&amp;#39;ve seen and she</text>
  <text start="541.7" dur="3.6">won a court she won custody hearing of</text>
  <text start="543.8" dur="3.24">her children at one point from one of</text>
  <text start="545.3" dur="3.36">her exes I don&amp;#39;t know the details but</text>
  <text start="547.04" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s kind of the thing that you have</text>
  <text start="548.66" dur="4.77">seen a lot of and I know that that goes</text>
  <text start="550.4" dur="6.36">on both sides anyway so he has to go up</text>
  <text start="553.43" dur="5.25">against the full power of the family</text>
  <text start="556.76" dur="4.41">court system which we&amp;#39;ve already covered</text>
  <text start="558.68" dur="5.4">is not it doesn&amp;#39;t follow the same kind</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="5.07">of laws it doesn&amp;#39;t follow your concept</text>
  <text start="564.08" dur="3.54">rights it does not give you due process</text>
  <text start="566.24" dur="3.96">it assumes that you&amp;#39;re guilty until</text>
  <text start="567.62" dur="4.8">proven innocent especially in like the</text>
  <text start="570.2" dur="3.66">CPS situations where they they medically</text>
  <text start="572.42" dur="3.84">kidnap children all the time and then</text>

  <text start="652.16" dur="5.97">until I was defrauded now in that sort</text>
  <text start="655.79" dur="5.039">of a defraud situation the police the</text>
  <text start="658.13" dur="4.92">investigators barely even dug into their</text>

  <text start="664.579" dur="4.681">waste the time and their lawyers made it</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="6.959">hard for them so I don&amp;#39;t know how you</text>

  <text start="678.41" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s there to find so hopefully she&amp;#39;ll</text>

  <text start="984.449" dur="3.901">can&amp;#39;t remember it</text>
  <text start="985.799" dur="4.26">the pendulum maybe I think it was but</text>
  <text start="988.35" dur="4.409">it&amp;#39;s about how history cycles back and</text>
