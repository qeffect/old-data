  <text start="122.47" dur="3.87">discuss this issue and make it a key</text>
  <text start="124.179" dur="3.05">feature of a plan to address climate</text>
  <text start="126.34" dur="5.459">catastrophe</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="6.941">well the answer is yes and the answer</text>
  <text start="131.799" dur="4.951">has everything to do with the fact that</text>
  <text start="134.17" dur="4.289">women in the United States of America by</text>
  <text start="136.75" dur="9.299">the way have a right to control their</text>
  <text start="138.459" dur="10.111">own bodies and the mexico city agreement</text>

  <text start="151.23" dur="6.43">that allow women to have abortions or</text>
  <text start="153.88" dur="6.27">even get involved in birth control to me</text>
  <text start="157.66" dur="5.579">is totally absurd so i think especially</text>
  <text start="160.15" dur="5.22">in poor countries around the world where</text>
  <text start="163.239" dur="4.711">women do not necessarily want to have</text>
  <text start="165.37" dur="4.589">large numbers of babies and where they</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="3.539">can have the opportunity through birth</text>
  <text start="169.959" dur="3.451">control to control the number of kids</text>
  <text start="171.489" dur="10.861">they have something i very very strongly</text>
  <text start="173.41" dur="11.37">us support for those who don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="6.539">it&amp;#39;s a cult look at that woman&amp;#39;s eyes</text>
  <text start="184.78" dur="6.12">like she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s one negative response</text>
  <text start="188.889" dur="4.32">to her worldview she&amp;#39;s one criticism</text>
  <text start="190.9" dur="7.589">away from losing it you can tell she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.209" dur="8.461">bought into the to the the cult kool-aid</text>
  <text start="198.489" dur="4.59">of climate change and and people really</text>
  <text start="201.67" dur="4.02">do believe in this they believe in it to</text>
  <text start="203.079" dur="6">such a degree then let me make this</text>
  <text start="205.69" dur="6.419">clear that women will forgo their</text>
  <text start="209.079" dur="5.041">natural reproductive urges okay they</text>
  <text start="212.109" dur="2.521">will actually overcome in some cases</text>
  <text start="214.12" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re mad</text>
  <text start="214.63" dur="4.5">reproductive urges because of this cult</text>
  <text start="217.42" dur="3.87">meaning that they will choose to not</text>
  <text start="219.13" dur="3.51">have children and they will go without</text>
  <text start="221.29" dur="3.48">having you know that the joy of</text>
  <text start="222.64" dur="3.57">motherhood and then to replace and</text>
  <text start="224.77" dur="4.08">replenish their family and everything</text>
  <text start="226.21" dur="4.05">else so you know some families are gonna</text>
  <text start="228.85" dur="5.55">die off because of that and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="7.44">very sad thing because of this cult this</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="5.19">this climate change alarmist cult with</text>
  <text start="237.7" dur="3.75">it there&amp;#39;s no evidence except the ones</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="3.72">that they made up there&amp;#39;s no consensus</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="4.17">except the one that they just repeated</text>
  <text start="243.31" dur="4.32">over and over about you know all the</text>
  <text start="245.62" dur="3.93">world&amp;#39;s scientists agree you know all</text>
  <text start="247.63" dur="3.93">these thousands of scientists agree it</text>
  <text start="249.55" dur="4.68">was never true none of it was ever true</text>
  <text start="251.56" dur="4.02">none of their predictions came true the</text>
  <text start="254.23" dur="3.75">only thing that really did happen was</text>
  <text start="255.58" dur="6.09">that they got more power and on board</text>
  <text start="257.98" dur="6.87">became a billionaire anyway just moving</text>
  <text start="261.67" dur="8.04">on we also have a lawyer for Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.85" dur="7.32">and madame and unless real fast by the</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="3.42">way when we&amp;#39;re talking about climate or</text>
  <text start="272.17" dur="3.63">not climate change but we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="4.74">about population control when Bernie</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="5.4">Sanders says you know my administration</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="6.12">would feature population control that</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="5.07">means first of all because the most</text>
  <text start="283.99" dur="4.62">palatable or palatable form of that</text>
  <text start="286.27" dur="4.62">right now is a push for abortion because</text>
  <text start="288.61" dur="4.05">they can sort of argue at least for</text>
  <text start="290.89" dur="5.04">really dumb people that that&amp;#39;s a woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="5.76">right rather than it&amp;#39;s more of a murder</text>
  <text start="295.93" dur="4.02">of another body because yes you know you</text>
  <text start="298.42" dur="3.63">have the right to do things to your own</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="5.31">body however you don&amp;#39;t have the right to</text>
  <text start="302.05" dur="5.94">kill another so they always focus on the</text>
  <text start="305.26" dur="5.19">the right of your body over precedents</text>
  <text start="307.99" dur="4.83">of the other child that you created and</text>
  <text start="310.45" dur="5.54">took responsibility for in that an</text>
  <text start="312.82" dur="5.4">instance and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a buyer&amp;#39;s remorse</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="4.9">mentality and it&amp;#39;s not appropriate for</text>
  <text start="318.22" dur="3.96">human life and that&amp;#39;s the first place</text>
  <text start="320.89" dur="2.58">they&amp;#39;ll start they&amp;#39;ll push abortion</text>
  <text start="322.18" dur="3.33">harder than ever and as he said</text>
  <text start="323.47" dur="4.77">worldwide with us money with your money</text>
  <text start="325.51" dur="5.13">they will push abortion but that is not</text>
  <text start="328.24" dur="4.2">where it stops where it stops is you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="3.51">not allowed to have children are you</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="2.96">this race are you white you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="334.15" dur="4.63">allowed to have children</text>
  <text start="335.4" dur="5.9">now we&amp;#39;re curbing population</text>
  <text start="338.78" dur="4.23">we have to stop climate change so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="341.3" dur="3.45">not allowed to have children and who</text>
  <text start="343.01" dur="3.09">gets to make that decision which races</text>
  <text start="344.75" dur="3.51">are going to be targeted for extinction</text>
  <text start="346.1" dur="5.7">because of that decision right so these</text>
  <text start="348.26" dur="6.21">are these are not ethical places to go</text>
  <text start="351.8" dur="5.73">and it&amp;#39;s certainly certainly a not an</text>
  <text start="354.47" dur="6.75">ethical place to allow people like this</text>
  <text start="357.53" dur="4.62">guy even near that kind of power you</text>
  <text start="361.22" dur="3.12">might hear my little one in the</text>
  <text start="362.15" dur="5.16">background there it&amp;#39;s breakfast time now</text>

  <text start="475.919" dur="3.361">stored in a bad health you know</text>

  <text start="1243.45" dur="2.609">and remember he&amp;#39;s supposed to pay for</text>
  <text start="1245.07" dur="3.3">the investigation the police</text>
  <text start="1246.059" dur="5.641">investigation which is like a hundred</text>
  <text start="1248.37" dur="5.07">and thirty thousand dollars and he his</text>
  <text start="1251.7" dur="3">lawyers are basically arguing well he</text>
  <text start="1253.44" dur="2.729">didn&amp;#39;t know it was gonna cost so much</text>
  <text start="1254.7" dur="3.179">and he didn&amp;#39;t know that he had to be on</text>
  <text start="1256.169" dur="4.71">the hook for this huge investigation</text>
  <text start="1257.879" dur="4.521">that was spurred by his his report he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1260.879" dur="2.691">still claiming it was so legit</text>
  <text start="1262.4" dur="3.33">you know he&amp;#39;s still maintaining his</text>
  <text start="1263.57" dur="5.88">innocence and stuff but he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="1265.73" dur="5.16">even get out of this and trying to you</text>
  <text start="1269.45" dur="3.42">know of course use that the State</text>
  <text start="1270.89" dur="3.87">Attorney&amp;#39;s Office had dropped the</text>
  <text start="1272.87" dur="3.57">charges and things and and we know why</text>
  <text start="1274.76" dur="5.1">that was because you know he had an</text>
  <text start="1276.44" dur="5.46">accomplice you know so so that was Kim I</text>
  <text start="1279.86" dur="6.36">think was Kim Fox so he had an</text>
  <text start="1281.9" dur="6.509">accomplice and you know that&amp;#39;s the story</text>
  <text start="1286.22" dur="4.65">as it goes until they opened up a recent</text>
  <text start="1288.409" dur="3.541">special investigation into Jesse and now</text>
  <text start="1290.87" dur="3.779">things are starting to get really</text>
  <text start="1291.95" dur="7.109">interesting aren&amp;#39;t they so you know this</text>
  <text start="1294.649" dur="6.481">is the probably the biggest really most</text>
  <text start="1299.059" dur="4.35">important thing is this fight around Ahn</text>
  <text start="1301.13" dur="4.649">right now because they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="1303.409" dur="3.87">use whatever they can to keep it down</text>
  <text start="1305.779" dur="3.721">until 2020 at the least</text>
  <text start="1307.279" dur="6.03">after that they probably won&amp;#39;t care as</text>
  <text start="1309.5" dur="5.73">much but in the meantime we have to do</text>
  <text start="1313.309" dur="4.47">what we can in with you know peacefully</text>
  <text start="1315.23" dur="4.439">to protect it you know even if that</text>
  <text start="1317.779" dur="4.26">means calling and writing your your</text>
  <text start="1319.669" dur="4.74">representatives or anything and just</text>
  <text start="1322.039" dur="4.61">tell them look we respect free speech</text>
  <text start="1324.409" dur="5.101">and if you don&amp;#39;t you lose our support</text>
  <text start="1326.649" dur="4.591">period there&amp;#39;s no ifs ands or buts about</text>
  <text start="1329.51" dur="5.25">it same thing with the Second Amendment</text>
