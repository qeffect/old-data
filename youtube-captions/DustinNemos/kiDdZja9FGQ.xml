  <text start="20.43" dur="5.59">hey guys welcome to autism one this is</text>
  <text start="23.38" dur="4.17">Dustin demos of Dustin emus calm you may</text>
  <text start="26.02" dur="3.81">or may not have heard about me but I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="27.55" dur="3.66">big fan of the autism one movement and</text>
  <text start="29.83" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;m a big supporter of all the</text>
  <text start="31.21" dur="3.9">anti-vaxxer now I&amp;#39;m actually</text>
  <text start="32.95" dur="4.08">interviewing dr. sinneth today and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="35.11" dur="3.78">an expert probably the expert in</text>
  <text start="37.03" dur="4.2">glyphosate which I&amp;#39;m pretty sure is what</text>
  <text start="38.89" dur="4.11">killed my grandfather but it&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="41.23" dur="3.09">thing lately especially because Monsanto</text>
  <text start="43" dur="2.4">Bayer they&amp;#39;re getting punished they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="44.32" dur="2.82">getting hammered</text>
  <text start="45.4" dur="5.939">they&amp;#39;ve been hammered very hard in</text>
  <text start="47.14" dur="6.21">lawsuits it&amp;#39;s optimistic news I think so</text>
  <text start="51.339" dur="3.93">doc I really appreciate it first of all</text>
  <text start="53.35" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;m a big fan as you&amp;#39;ve already kind of</text>
  <text start="55.269" dur="2.671">told you and then of course I&amp;#39;m a big</text>
  <text start="56.86" dur="2.519">supporter of your work</text>
  <text start="57.94" dur="3.45">thank you but thank you for sitting down</text>
  <text start="59.379" dur="4.801">with me taking the time and I just I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="61.39" dur="4.68">like to first of all catch everybody up</text>
  <text start="64.18" dur="3.81">on the dangers of glyphosate kind of</text>
  <text start="66.07" dur="3.54">your background and that just to know in</text>
  <text start="67.99" dur="3.57">a fast you&amp;#39;ve talked about it a hundred</text>
  <text start="69.61" dur="3.63">times I know but just that sort of the</text>
  <text start="71.56" dur="3.3">bullet points of what we need to know in</text>
  <text start="73.24" dur="7.14">the modern now what&amp;#39;s going on with this</text>
  <text start="74.86" dur="7.5">issue obviously Monsanto Bayer I mean I</text>
  <text start="80.38" dur="4.35">think we&amp;#39;ve been to very much to say</text>
  <text start="82.36" dur="5.19">about glyphosate and its degree of</text>
  <text start="84.73" dur="4.68">toxicity for 40 years and we&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="87.55" dur="3.93">poisoned more and more each year with</text>
  <text start="89.41" dur="4.38">this chemical and I think it is the most</text>
  <text start="91.48" dur="4.08">important reason why we have an epidemic</text>
  <text start="93.79" dur="4.41">in so many diseases including of course</text>
  <text start="95.56" dur="3.48">autism noticin was the one I was focused</text>
  <text start="98.2" dur="3.12">on</text>
  <text start="99.04" dur="4.41">and the more I looked at what how</text>
  <text start="101.32" dur="4.08">glyphosate works biochemically involved</text>
  <text start="103.45" dur="4.47">physically and what are all those</text>
  <text start="105.4" dur="4.35">complicated symptoms of autism I can</text>
  <text start="107.92" dur="4.38">line up everything I can basically use</text>
  <text start="109.75" dur="4.08">by state to explain all these different</text>
  <text start="112.3" dur="4.68">features of autism into such a</text>
  <text start="113.83" dur="5.52">complicated disease but you can explain</text>
  <text start="116.98" dur="5.04">all that complication because glyphosate</text>
  <text start="119.35" dur="5.04">is a very toxic chemical with a unique</text>
  <text start="122.02" dur="4.32">mechanism of toxicity which is what I</text>
  <text start="124.39" dur="4.02">believe and this is my research and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="126.34" dur="5.37">a theory or a hypothesis you might say</text>
  <text start="128.41" dur="5.46">that I have about the way it works which</text>
  <text start="131.71" dur="4.35">is to get into proteins by mistake in</text>
  <text start="133.87" dur="4.23">place of encoding amino acid glycine so</text>
  <text start="136.06" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s disrupting the proteins throughout</text>
  <text start="138.1" dur="3.96">your body yeah and it accumulates in the</text>
  <text start="140.41" dur="4.62">proteins throughout your body over time</text>
  <text start="142.06" dur="6.03">so as you get exposed most of it goes in</text>
  <text start="145.03" dur="6">comes out maybe 98 percent 2% stays</text>
  <text start="148.09" dur="5.91">behind and goes in national places like</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="5.64">the brain and causes a space just like</text>
  <text start="154" dur="4.02">mercury and over time you get more and</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="2.789">more accumulation at some point</text>
  <text start="158.02" dur="3.75">something gives and something gets very</text>
  <text start="159.459" dur="4.131">sick an organ dies or you get all</text>
  <text start="161.77" dur="3.81">Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease or you get</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="4.899">non-hodgkins lymphoma I mean all of</text>
  <text start="165.58" dur="6">these diseases that we&amp;#39;re seeing arising</text>
  <text start="168.489" dur="5.551">alarmingly in the society glyphosate can</text>
  <text start="171.58" dur="3.99">explain that rise and it matches very</text>
  <text start="174.04" dur="4.26">well when you look at the use of</text>
  <text start="175.57" dur="4.56">glyphosate encore crops it aligns with a</text>
  <text start="178.3" dur="3.6">rate of rise of all of these</text>
  <text start="180.13" dur="4.38">diseases very strong correlations</text>
  <text start="181.9" dur="5.04">nothing else in agriculture has gone up</text>
  <text start="184.51" dur="4.71">in usage the way glyphosate has because</text>
  <text start="186.94" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s been considered to be so safe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.22" dur="5.34">the safe alternative to all these other</text>
  <text start="191.02" dur="4.77">toxic toxic herbicides that are they</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="2.58">supposed to be the safe alternative</text>
  <text start="195.79" dur="3.21">which is why they conferred and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="197.14" dur="3.54">engineered the crops to resist it so it</text>
  <text start="199" dur="3.57">makes it very easy to use it just spray</text>
  <text start="200.68" dur="3.66">it all over the crop the crop doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="202.57" dur="3.42">die but it&amp;#39;s very clear that it soaks it</text>
  <text start="204.34" dur="3.63">up that&amp;#39;s a good shot yeah the way you</text>
  <text start="205.99" dur="4.47">didn&amp;#39;t and then we did we get sick of</text>
  <text start="207.97" dur="3.87">course no surprise now let me ask this I</text>
  <text start="210.46" dur="3.6">don&amp;#39;t even I don&amp;#39;t even know this answer</text>
  <text start="211.84" dur="3.75">so I&amp;#39;m very curious for myself but if we</text>
  <text start="214.06" dur="3.33">were to just get rid of it all tomorrow</text>
  <text start="215.59" dur="4.89">and they pulled it from the shelves the</text>
  <text start="217.39" dur="4.92">lawsuits did their job is the damage</text>
  <text start="220.48" dur="4.56">done using we get it back out of the</text>
  <text start="222.31" dur="4.35">environment well yeah there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="225.04" dur="3.27">of things one is that guys eight sticks</text>
  <text start="226.66" dur="3.69">around for a long time in certain places</text>
  <text start="228.31" dur="3.63">so it really depends on in the soil</text>
  <text start="230.35" dur="3.48">which microbes are there whether there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="3.96">minerals that could bind to the back</text>
  <text start="233.83" dur="3.84">state where there&amp;#39;s organic matter I</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="3.66">mean it&amp;#39;s gonna differ it&amp;#39;s how how long</text>
  <text start="237.67" dur="4.08">it lasts in certain soils it can last</text>
  <text start="239.56" dur="3.27">for a very long time even years and</text>
  <text start="241.75" dur="2.01">we&amp;#39;re gonna have to figure out how to</text>
  <text start="242.83" dur="3.18">get it out</text>
  <text start="243.76" dur="4.619">it also of course lingers in our bodies</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="4.07">and also it has epidemic effect so that</text>
  <text start="248.379" dur="5.341">they&amp;#39;ve shown in recent studies on mice</text>
  <text start="250.08" dur="6.52">that it&amp;#39;s a grandmother is exposed to</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="5.519">glyphosate during pregnancy then the</text>
  <text start="256.6" dur="3.69">grandchild shows effects from that even</text>
  <text start="259.239" dur="3.9">though they didn&amp;#39;t get any further</text>
  <text start="260.29" dur="5.7">exposure after that pregnancy so we have</text>
  <text start="263.139" dur="4.831">a memory of glyphosate in our genes in</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="3.929">our in our genetic system that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="4.05">to show up in future generations</text>
  <text start="269.919" dur="4.051">you know I&amp;#39;m not I don&amp;#39;t usually go to</text>
  <text start="272.02" dur="4.08">spiritual on things but I would say that</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s almost appropriate because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="276.1" dur="5.819">doing so much damage to our bodies and</text>
  <text start="278.5" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s so bad on such a large level and</text>
  <text start="281.919" dur="2.461">there&amp;#39;s so much greed and corruption of</text>
  <text start="283.06" dur="3.99">all of that it&amp;#39;s almost as though it</text>
  <text start="284.38" dur="4.56">should scar our spirits to do this for a</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="3.42">while but not not the innocent and</text>
  <text start="288.94" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s the best the rule it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="5.16">really sad there&amp;#39;s gonna be a whole lot</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="4.62">of people that are have a tragic tragic</text>
  <text start="295.63" dur="3.9">life because of this I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.28" dur="4.02">learning and especially I&amp;#39;m so worried</text>
  <text start="299.53" dur="3.75">about the children because the next</text>
  <text start="301.3" dur="4.619">generation is going to be so sick and</text>
  <text start="303.28" dur="5.22">how are they going to to maintain the</text>
  <text start="305.919" dur="4.291">society that we have when there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="308.5" dur="3.24">their effort it&amp;#39;s going to be going into</text>
  <text start="310.21" dur="3.78">taking care of the people that are sick</text>
  <text start="311.74" dur="5.67">yes I mean it&amp;#39;s gonna be very sad tax</text>
  <text start="313.99" dur="5.52">cannot imagine how much work and how</text>
  <text start="317.41" dur="4.41">much stress and pain and suffering it</text>
  <text start="319.51" dur="3.69">must be to raise you know really some</text>
  <text start="321.82" dur="2.88">autistic children are not as bad as</text>
  <text start="323.2" dur="3.089">others but there are some bad ones and</text>
  <text start="324.7" dur="4.46">this is the kind of chemical that can</text>
  <text start="326.289" dur="4.641">end you up with that situation so</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="3.57">you know this could mean the difference</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="5.34">between heaven and hell on earth or</text>
  <text start="332.73" dur="5.22">something I am a satellite and I really</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="3">appreciate the realms of the autistic</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="3.3">kids they&amp;#39;re on a journey tired I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="3.18">prepared to determine to figure out how</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="3.06">to fix it and they&amp;#39;re making progress</text>
  <text start="342.45" dur="4.26">and that is really really exciting to me</text>
  <text start="344.31" dur="4.56">so I wish that the medical system was</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="5.46">more on board with the treatments that</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="4.92">are needed healing people yeah it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="352.17" dur="6.9">mainstream medicine is just on the wrong</text>
  <text start="353.79" dur="7.64">track you know you&amp;#39;d brought up another</text>
  <text start="359.07" dur="4.56">topic about getting it out of the soil</text>
  <text start="361.43" dur="3.61">binders and such now I used to do a</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="3.3">little bit of farming kind of mostly</text>
  <text start="365.04" dur="3.27">personal hobby but you know soil</text>
  <text start="366.93" dur="2.55">amendments that kind of thing I was</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="3.66">always really careful about making sure</text>
  <text start="369.48" dur="3.81">my soil is fed is there something that</text>
  <text start="371.97" dur="4.14">we could feed the soil that would say</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="4.56">today was the same thing that&amp;#39;s a width</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="3.72">of gut you have to get introduced</text>
  <text start="377.85" dur="3.93">microbes there are only certain species</text>
  <text start="379.83" dur="4.74">that can break it down because it has a</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="4.44">very difficult CP bond so it stick it it</text>
  <text start="384.57" dur="3.6">doesn&amp;#39;t get broken down easily</text>
  <text start="386.22" dur="3.48">but the microbes that have the enzymes</text>
  <text start="388.17" dur="4.59">that can break it down that&amp;#39;s what you</text>
  <text start="389.7" dur="4.95">need in the soil to to get it to</text>
  <text start="392.76" dur="5.09">disappear past there&amp;#39;s also things you</text>
  <text start="394.65" dur="6.39">can do with oxidizing agents like ozone</text>
  <text start="397.85" dur="6.5">chlorine dioxide and even sunlight you</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="5.11">break it down to oxide yourself yes</text>
  <text start="404.35" dur="4.13">very cheap and very back I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="5.34">say too much about okay I so contrary</text>
  <text start="408.48" dur="5.23">there&amp;#39;s people who are desperately what</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="4.17">you know I&amp;#39;m against censorship I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="4.17">journalist first and I&amp;#39;d free speech</text>
  <text start="415.66" dur="4.02">whether you agree with it or not should</text>
  <text start="417.88" dur="3.84">be our one thing will be all agree on</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="4.2">from any walk of life and Carrie</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="4.74">Rivera&amp;#39;s book was a was banned recently</text>
  <text start="423.88" dur="4.14">I know all about that yeah on one on</text>
  <text start="426.46" dur="4.29">Amazon and that was right after I did my</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="4.44">book so it&amp;#39;s even more censored more</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="3.27">banned thing it&amp;#39;s amazing how much</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="3.38">things come down on her and I think</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="5.43">chlorine dioxide is were very cheap</text>
  <text start="435.84" dur="5.5">solution and she has found miraculous</text>
  <text start="439.45" dur="3.3">results and so have many other people in</text>
  <text start="441.34" dur="4.14">other trick things for example an</text>
  <text start="442.75" dur="4.56">abscess choose you can just do oral you</text>
  <text start="445.48" dur="4.44">know</text>
  <text start="447.31" dur="5.47">not swallowing it you know just just</text>
  <text start="449.92" dur="5.8">rinsing rinsing it in your mouth it can</text>
  <text start="452.78" dur="4.8">really help you to heal I infections in</text>
  <text start="455.72" dur="4.23">your mouth I use it in a regular basis</text>
  <text start="457.58" dur="4.35">just to try to like scrub any kind of</text>
  <text start="459.95" dur="3.33">Candida or anything that bothered me I</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="2.94">separate I kind of take this in the</text>
  <text start="463.28" dur="3.48">morning I take my antioxidants at night</text>
  <text start="464.87" dur="3.15">and the thing is they use it in the</text>
  <text start="466.76" dur="4.47">water too</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="5.55">in water treatment plants they use it to</text>
  <text start="471.23" dur="3.96">to kill the microbes unfortunately they</text>
  <text start="473.57" dur="3.09">use it because that&amp;#39;s helping to get rid</text>
  <text start="475.19" dur="4.23">of the glyphosate in the water I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="476.66" dur="5.37">very glad to know that they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="479.42" dur="4.8">chlorine dioxide in the treatment in the</text>
  <text start="482.03" dur="4.32">water supply because that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="3.78">help to reduce our drive state low from</text>
  <text start="486.35" dur="4.23">the water we drink to my dogs and cats</text>
  <text start="488" dur="6.51">water so that I mean that is a really</text>
  <text start="490.58" dur="5.43">exciting I here&amp;#39;s the thing I know that</text>
  <text start="494.51" dur="3.09">people that sell this have been punished</text>
  <text start="496.01" dur="3.6">and I know you know the Red Cross</text>
  <text start="497.6" dur="4.26">supposedly they cured like a huge</text>
  <text start="499.61" dur="4.59">outbreak of malaria one time supposedly</text>
  <text start="501.86" dur="4.05">you know and then campus hall is all</text>
  <text start="504.2" dur="3.63">crushed up or covered up and then</text>
  <text start="505.91" dur="3.21">supposedly never happened but you know</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="2.4">the videos are still there they had all</text>
  <text start="509.12" dur="1.82">those people that were cured like</text>
  <text start="510.23" dur="4.23">pennies a day</text>
  <text start="510.94" dur="4.63">malaria so you know without making any</text>
  <text start="514.46" dur="3.87">kind of planes or anything like that</text>
  <text start="515.57" dur="4.089">obviously we can&amp;#39;t always trust the</text>
  <text start="518.33" dur="3.25">government yes</text>
  <text start="519.659" dur="3.511">[Music]</text>
  <text start="521.58" dur="2.88">because the pharmaceutical companies</text>
  <text start="523.17" dur="3.27">it&amp;#39;s so interesting because anything</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="3.72">that you can patent they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="3.69">after it if you can&amp;#39;t patent it then</text>
  <text start="528.18" dur="3.93">forget it they&amp;#39;re not interested and the</text>
  <text start="530.13" dur="3.39">things that are are healthy and</text>

  <text start="537.93" dur="3.33">like a huge level of billionaires and</text>
  <text start="539.67" dur="4.32">stuff but while we&amp;#39;re having the</text>
  <text start="541.26" dur="4.8">conversation is it so bad to just go</text>

  <text start="561.45" dur="3.51">know I mean they&amp;#39;ve got a good system</text>
  <text start="563.28" dur="3.36">going because they poison us with the</text>
  <text start="564.96" dur="3.96">glyphosate make us very sick and then</text>
  <text start="566.64" dur="3.57">they hand us all these pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="568.92" dur="3.75">drugs and they make a ton of money on</text>
  <text start="570.21" dur="4.5">that it&amp;#39;s the same industry you know the</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="6.66">agrochemical and the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="574.71" dur="6.24">industries are my first thing I would go</text>
  <text start="579.33" dur="3.18">with like fund all the vitamin C and all</text>
  <text start="580.95" dur="3.15">the other cheap stock yeah one wants to</text>
  <text start="582.51" dur="4.95">touch that you can&amp;#39;t patent and just</text>
  <text start="584.1" dur="6.27">bake it so they can&amp;#39;t make any money it</text>
  <text start="587.46" dur="4.86">would be and I wish that we could fight</text>
  <text start="590.37" dur="4.11">against this thing in win it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="592.32" dur="3.63">very powerful when you&amp;#39;ve got a system</text>
  <text start="594.48" dur="3.58">that&amp;#39;s pulling in so much money you can</text>
  <text start="595.95" dur="3.88">use that money to control everything</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="3.12">and that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing well you</text>
  <text start="599.83" dur="2.88">know I wasn&amp;#39;t even gonna say anything</text>
  <text start="601.18" dur="2.82">about this but there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a book</text>
  <text start="602.71" dur="3.96">called heart of war many people have</text>
  <text start="604" dur="4.62">heard of it I&amp;#39;m the family it&amp;#39;s a strict</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="4.08">a strategy book first and foremost but</text>
  <text start="608.62" dur="3.78">one of the concepts is how do you beat</text>
  <text start="610.75" dur="3.09">an enemy that&amp;#39;s just play bigger lay</text>
  <text start="612.4" dur="3.6">more funded wait bigger military</text>
  <text start="613.84" dur="4.05">stronger whatever in this case you know</text>
  <text start="616" dur="4.29">Big Pharma they&amp;#39;re so entrenched they</text>
  <text start="617.89" dur="4.77">have such forces in government to use</text>
  <text start="620.29" dur="4.98">against us and I have so much money beat</text>
  <text start="622.66" dur="4.05">him I was uh I was playing around with a</text>
  <text start="625.27" dur="3.39">concept where we maybe we could use some</text>
  <text start="626.71" dur="3.63">of their own money against I mean</text>
  <text start="628.66" dur="3.75">imagine if you you go and you start up a</text>
  <text start="630.34" dur="11.46">local pharmacy but you donate some of</text>
  <text start="632.41" dur="11.28">that money it gets to alternating like</text>
  <text start="641.8" dur="3.72">kung fu&amp;#39; it back at them I think anyone</text>
  <text start="643.69" dur="5.97">could do that I think as long as there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="645.52" dur="6.54">like a big form of profits to get those</text>
  <text start="649.66" dur="5.31">profits by selling pitching no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="652.06" dur="4.59">gonna large so when we do that yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="654.97" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s a problem I thought you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="656.65" dur="3.48">got a ton of people my audience that are</text>
  <text start="658.39" dur="3.96">in their 50s and 60s and they&amp;#39;re on like</text>
  <text start="660.13" dur="3.39">prescription drugs in session and many</text>
  <text start="662.35" dur="2.94">of them want to get off many of them</text>
  <text start="663.52" dur="3.57">want to get off no matter you know what</text>
  <text start="665.29" dur="3.18">alternatives are out there what research</text>
  <text start="667.09" dur="3.3">is available they&amp;#39;re just afraid and</text>
  <text start="668.47" dur="4.98">their doctors are you know pushing the</text>
  <text start="670.39" dur="5.13">fear to sell the pills but maybe they</text>
  <text start="673.45" dur="3.3">would want to like fund something like</text>
  <text start="675.52" dur="2.79">that with their money instead of</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="3.99">shopping at the local like you know a</text>
  <text start="678.31" dur="4.92">big pharma market or something I feel</text>
  <text start="680.74" dur="5.02">like with the trillions of dollars that</text>
  <text start="683.23" dur="3.88">these people are making oh man what</text>
  <text start="685.76" dur="2.82">charity was something like that I think</text>
  <text start="687.11" dur="3.45">we could you know explore that concept</text>
  <text start="688.58" dur="3.33">more of it there&amp;#39;s got to be solutions</text>
  <text start="690.56" dur="2.97">maybe there&amp;#39;s like a millionaire that&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="691.91" dur="3.36">just drop it on it I would love to see</text>
  <text start="693.53" dur="3.57">some magnanimous billionaire I keep</text>

  <text start="868.27" dur="3.06">the stuff that we&amp;#39;re talking about in</text>
  <text start="869.65" dur="5.34">the ultra journalists truths community</text>

  <text start="921.43" dur="2.94">do you think that is great if you have</text>
  <text start="923.05" dur="3.27">optimism I am feeling optimistic</text>
  <text start="924.37" dur="3.03">especially with these lawsuits waiting</text>
  <text start="926.32" dur="3.63">because I think that&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="927.4" dur="4.68">breakthrough it doesn&amp;#39;t happen until you</text>
  <text start="929.95" dur="4.5">have enough evidence and they have</text>
  <text start="932.08" dur="5.43">enough evidence of Monsanto&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="934.45" dur="4.8">misbehavior in manipulating the results</text>
  <text start="937.51" dur="4.92">of the tests and whatnot and the way</text>

  <text start="945.88" dur="5.67">win these lawsuits and to win big and</text>
  <text start="948.31" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s so 2015 thousand as far as I know</text>
  <text start="951.55" dur="4.98">maybe even more at this point behind</text>
  <text start="953.35" dur="5.76">these three and Bobby Kennedy said it so</text>

  <text start="1059.27" dur="4.1">glyphosate we&amp;#39;ve talked to them about</text>
  <text start="1060.83" dur="5.46">Big Pharma the vaccine movement</text>
  <text start="1063.37" dur="5.44">censorship obviously to kind of recap we</text>
  <text start="1066.29" dur="4.77">went into censorship are there any other</text>
  <text start="1068.81" dur="4.29">big pressing issues I mean obviously the</text>

  <text start="1076.43" dur="3.9">society the most I guess I mean my</text>
  <text start="1078.74" dur="4.26">feeling is that we live in a very toxic</text>
  <text start="1080.33" dur="5.13">world and the industries are producing</text>
  <text start="1083" dur="4.5">those toxic chemicals and they&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="1104.39" dur="5.94">mean it&amp;#39;s kind of dubious whether we</text>
  <text start="1108.53" dur="3.45">have a future I mean I think if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1110.33" dur="3.96">fix this problem humans are gonna go</text>
  <text start="1111.98" dur="4.38">extinct I really believe that and</text>
  <text start="1114.29" dur="4.17">especially because it&amp;#39;s affecting later</text>
  <text start="1116.36" dur="5.46">generations later generations are losing</text>

  <text start="1127.49" dur="4.14">even if we were to clean up everything</text>
  <text start="1128.87" dur="4.92">right now so we really have to think of</text>
  <text start="1131.63" dur="3.929">this as an emergency we have to it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1133.79" dur="3.269">almost as though like if you treat your</text>

  <text start="1155.72" dur="4.47">you can renovate but it&amp;#39;ll never be the</text>

  <text start="1170.45" dur="4.17">be fixed because the soil is falling</text>
  <text start="1172.37" dur="3.72">apart and that&amp;#39;s causing all the</text>

  <text start="1204.739" dur="4.331">not even I don&amp;#39;t even think that is like</text>
  <text start="1206.999" dur="4.5">a huge threat I&amp;#39;m at this point I think</text>
  <text start="1209.07" dur="4.199">you know that the pesticides that</text>
  <text start="1211.499" dur="3.78">obviously the damage that it does to the</text>

  <text start="1221.009" dur="3.12">well that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s with the</text>
  <text start="1222.45" dur="3.689">renewable agriculture I think to learn</text>
  <text start="1224.129" dur="4.23">how to fix the soil and how to remove</text>

  <text start="1234.659" dur="5.43">after Chernobyl like animals came back</text>
  <text start="1236.369" dur="5.73">things finally hopefully we&amp;#39;ll find a</text>
  <text start="1240.089" dur="3.241">way to fix the soil that&amp;#39;s probably the</text>
  <text start="1242.099" dur="2.851">most important thing we need to do is</text>
  <text start="1243.33" dur="3.75">once you fix the soil you fix the food</text>
  <text start="1244.95" dur="4.26">to fix the people you know everything</text>
  <text start="1247.08" dur="3.299">follows this is kind of enough just off</text>
  <text start="1249.21" dur="2.639">the top of my head I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to</text>
  <text start="1250.379" dur="4.5">do this for myself but there&amp;#39;s a machine</text>
  <text start="1251.849" dur="5.4">on that you can get it&amp;#39;s like a almost</text>
  <text start="1254.879" dur="3.78">like just a track two tracks and a</text>
  <text start="1257.249" dur="2.85">little robot that goes back and forth</text>
  <text start="1258.659" dur="3.24">like kind of like a bigger version of a</text>
  <text start="1260.099" dur="4.71">3d printer if you watch the inside run</text>
  <text start="1261.899" dur="6.681">back and forth and it plants food and it</text>
  <text start="1264.809" dur="7.32">grows enough greens for family of four</text>
  <text start="1268.58" dur="4.929">so imagine like that&amp;#39;s only about a</text>
  <text start="1272.129" dur="3.061">couple thousand dollars now but is that</text>
  <text start="1273.509" dur="4.441">technology gets lower and lower you can</text>
  <text start="1275.19" dur="4.829">have their own indoor garden garden</text>
  <text start="1277.95" dur="3.779">robotic weed killing because robots</text>
  <text start="1280.019" dur="3.421">could learn yeah yeah well bunch of</text>
  <text start="1281.729" dur="2.811">praise art these days and you can build</text>

  <text start="1289.1" dur="6.17">recharged I want to start like a</text>
  <text start="1295.54" dur="5.62">possibility and we should be investing</text>
  <text start="1297.92" dur="5.64">in in those solutions because and of</text>
  <text start="1301.16" dur="4.26">course manual labor labor is always an</text>
  <text start="1303.56" dur="4.44">option and we we so proud don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1305.42" dur="4.44">any can do that anymore we have all this</text>
  <text start="1308" dur="3.45">effort we put a lot of our effort into</text>
  <text start="1309.86" dur="3.06">to going after things that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1311.45" dur="3.39">necessarily help society and you know</text>

  <text start="1323.51" dur="4.83">less force and even Victory Gardens the</text>
  <text start="1326.09" dur="4.35">concept of taking your own food</text>
  <text start="1328.34" dur="4.05">controlling your own food by growing it</text>
  <text start="1330.44" dur="3.36">yourself is really awesome and I think</text>
  <text start="1332.39" dur="3.6">people should be encouraged to do that</text>
  <text start="1333.8" dur="4.32">if they have a plot of land their own</text>
  <text start="1335.99" dur="3.36">food and it&amp;#39;ll be fine you have some</text>
  <text start="1338.12" dur="2.7">variety different plants just like a</text>
  <text start="1339.35" dur="5.33">thousand of tomatoes you&amp;#39;ve never even</text>

  <text start="1359" dur="3.72">us I mean we&amp;#39;ve got the health issues</text>
  <text start="1360.59" dur="3.81">obviously our health falling apart and</text>
  <text start="1362.72" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s multi-generational the damage is</text>
  <text start="1364.4" dur="4.77">done we just have to make the best of it</text>
  <text start="1366.05" dur="4.32">try to avoid the worst of it I mean some</text>
  <text start="1369.17" dur="1.89">like fluoride you&amp;#39;re talking about in</text>
  <text start="1370.37" dur="3.99">the water supply</text>
  <text start="1371.06" dur="5.34">it actually calcifies your your your</text>
  <text start="1374.36" dur="4.23">brain it actually makes you pathetic</text>
  <text start="1376.4" dur="4.11">like you don&amp;#39;t feel things as much so if</text>
  <text start="1378.59" dur="2.63">you have a child or if you have a parent</text>
  <text start="1380.51" dur="2.75">or</text>

  <text start="1386.5" dur="3">they&amp;#39;re glad to say does that yeah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1388.09" dur="4.17">glyphosate so these things actually</text>
  <text start="1389.5" dur="4.64">affect who you are on a fundamental</text>
  <text start="1392.26" dur="4.56">level almost as though you could say it</text>
  <text start="1394.14" dur="4.81">poisons your soul I know I would say</text>
  <text start="1396.82" dur="2.79">that yes any of you you know if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1398.95" dur="2.7">ever been</text>
  <text start="1399.61" dur="3.27">I don&amp;#39;t like juice fasting or something</text>
  <text start="1401.65" dur="3.59">and you do that for a week then you</text>
  <text start="1402.88" dur="6.029">suddenly feel like the opposite an</text>
  <text start="1405.24" dur="5.74">energy imbalance but you know we have</text>
  <text start="1408.909" dur="5.25">other issues facing us as well and I</text>
  <text start="1410.98" dur="5.579">think you know you mentioned climate</text>
  <text start="1414.159" dur="4.02">change I think there&amp;#39;s definitely some</text>
  <text start="1416.559" dur="3.541">analytical issues there I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1418.179" dur="3.63">a lot of folks who have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1420.1" dur="3.78">different solutions and such and there</text>
  <text start="1421.809" dur="4.471">needs to be I think resident from put</text>
  <text start="1423.88" dur="5.039">together some sort of council on going</text>
  <text start="1426.28" dur="5.79">into all of the information for that and</text>
  <text start="1428.919" dur="4.921">I know we&amp;#39;ve got you know obviously war</text>
  <text start="1432.07" dur="3">issues and facing us today I mean I</text>
  <text start="1433.84" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t want go in all these issues too</text>
  <text start="1435.07" dur="4.739">much but this is hitting us from all</text>
  <text start="1436.99" dur="4.38">these different angles so you know other</text>
  <text start="1439.809" dur="3.391">than lawsuits you know we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1441.37" dur="3.48">about lawsuits versus big pharma big</text>
  <text start="1443.2" dur="3.62">tech stuff like that what else do you</text>
  <text start="1444.85" dur="4.59">see that we could do to help people</text>
  <text start="1446.82" dur="4.42">effectively I mean with respect to</text>
  <text start="1449.44" dur="3.869">glyphosate I think it most important</text>
  <text start="1451.24" dur="4.049">thing is people to eat organic food and</text>
  <text start="1453.309" dur="4.291">by buying organic they&amp;#39;re supporting the</text>
  <text start="1455.289" dur="3.931">organic farmer which will help to</text>
  <text start="1457.6" dur="3.63">encourage farmers to switch to organic</text>
  <text start="1459.22" dur="4.23">farming which also help those farmers</text>
  <text start="1461.23" dur="5.46">stay healthy so if that when everybody</text>
  <text start="1463.45" dur="4.68">wins if the person buys the organic food</text>
  <text start="1466.69" dur="4.859">or so we can do this grassroots</text>
  <text start="1468.13" dur="5.88">bottom-up just speaking voting with our</text>
  <text start="1471.549" dur="4.86">pocketbooks by buying organic food start</text>
  <text start="1474.01" dur="5.94">a local co-op even it just buddies or or</text>
  <text start="1476.409" dur="6.15">or you might just mention growing your</text>
  <text start="1479.95" dur="3.17">own food to I think just really focusing</text>
  <text start="1482.559" dur="2.301">on</text>
  <text start="1483.12" dur="5.31">healthy and eating Whole Foods rather</text>
  <text start="1484.86" dur="4.949">than processed food and do it right you</text>
  <text start="1488.43" dur="3.42">can grow money with some light I mean</text>
  <text start="1489.809" dur="5.431">that&amp;#39;s right gelatin does that all right</text>
  <text start="1491.85" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s great yeah and telling all your</text>

  <text start="1501.48" dur="2.94">growing or anything like that you</text>
  <text start="1502.77" dur="4.5">probably like you know people may have</text>
  <text start="1504.42" dur="4.2">not gone to like a harvest dinner or</text>
  <text start="1507.27" dur="3.21">something with a big group of people and</text>

  <text start="1510.48" dur="8.37">clean the dirt off this and then you eat</text>
  <text start="1512.16" dur="8.6">it it&amp;#39;s one of those things the</text>
  <text start="1518.85" dur="5.34">community at all most people these days</text>
  <text start="1520.76" dur="4.93">there&amp;#39;s no community but you know we</text>
  <text start="1524.19" dur="3.63">need that back we need a community back</text>
  <text start="1525.69" dur="3.69">and we need a culture where people can</text>
  <text start="1527.82" dur="2.88">kind of get together be with friends be</text>
  <text start="1529.38" dur="2.84">with those who you know kind of on the</text>
  <text start="1530.7" dur="3.66">same page you know idealistically</text>
  <text start="1532.22" dur="5.08">ideologically and they can get together</text>
  <text start="1534.36" dur="3.78">and have fun or affect change or fight</text>
  <text start="1537.3" dur="3.3">for good causes</text>
  <text start="1538.14" dur="4.919">you know maybe do dinner on Thursday and</text>

  <text start="1636.76" dur="3.149">anybody to are so no just to say just</text>
  <text start="1638.62" dur="2.97">you go ahead get your vaccine</text>
  <text start="1639.909" dur="3.27">I don&amp;#39;t care but don&amp;#39;t make me get mine</text>
  <text start="1641.59" dur="2.91">I know some of these people I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="1643.179" dur="2.791">buy their vaccines for them you know</text>
  <text start="1644.5" dur="3.299">just give them a couple of extra so that</text>
  <text start="1645.97" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re covered all of the ones pushing</text>
  <text start="1647.799" dur="3.6">it for example I would be happy to do</text>
  <text start="1649.75" dur="3.779">that and televise it and let them take</text>
  <text start="1651.399" dur="3.421">it on they won&amp;#39;t and you know they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1653.529" dur="4.081">most they probably don&amp;#39;t really either</text>
  <text start="1654.82" dur="4.079">take it just like a lot of the CDC</text>
  <text start="1657.61" dur="7.83">Tigers you know they&amp;#39;re not drinking the</text>
  <text start="1658.899" dur="7.981">milks they&amp;#39;re not doing the general you</text>
  <text start="1665.44" dur="3.719">know we have this double standard we</text>
  <text start="1666.88" dur="4.83">have this profits over people mentality</text>
  <text start="1669.159" dur="5.281">we&amp;#39;ve got this sort of big nightmare</text>
  <text start="1671.71" dur="4.86">system that&amp;#39;s been hurting us for a</text>
  <text start="1674.44" dur="4.2">while and now we&amp;#39;re sort of overthrowing</text>
  <text start="1676.57" dur="4.02">that and obviously that systems fighting</text>
  <text start="1678.64" dur="5.009">back we&amp;#39;ve seen the FDA sort of like I</text>
  <text start="1680.59" dur="4.8">said go after you know home schoolers go</text>
  <text start="1683.649" dur="3.51">after you know rights where you States</text>
  <text start="1685.39" dur="3.779">where you have the right to object based</text>
  <text start="1687.159" dur="3.27">on religious or medical or whatever I</text>
  <text start="1689.169" dur="5.281">think you should be able to just say no</text>
  <text start="1690.429" dur="5.911">period so with respect to the vaccines I</text>
  <text start="1694.45" dur="3.9">think at least two things need to happen</text>
  <text start="1696.34" dur="4.68">that would really change the picture</text>
  <text start="1698.35" dur="5.97">number one is to get rid of the 1986 law</text>
  <text start="1701.02" dur="5.519">that made that the companies not</text>
  <text start="1704.32" dur="4.589">accountable for the injury that is such</text>
  <text start="1706.539" dur="4.291">a gift to the country companies they</text>
  <text start="1708.909" dur="4.291">have yeah and then the other thing is</text>
  <text start="1710.83" dur="3.959">the mandate so both of those makes this</text>
  <text start="1713.2" dur="3.15">such an attractive product of the</text>
  <text start="1714.789" dur="4.591">companies because they don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1716.35" dur="5.429">worry about lawsuits no matter how sick</text>
  <text start="1719.38" dur="3.96">the child gets from the vaccine and then</text>
  <text start="1721.779" dur="3.421">they have a ready market if it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1723.34" dur="3.54">mandate they&amp;#39;ve got all the children</text>
  <text start="1725.2" dur="3.78">right are already marking without any</text>
  <text start="1726.88" dur="4.11">advertising so they have to spend money</text>
  <text start="1728.98" dur="3.36">on advertising and they it&amp;#39;s not a drug</text>
  <text start="1730.99" dur="2.909">so they don&amp;#39;t have to go through the</text>
  <text start="1732.34" dur="4.049">rigorous process and we&amp;#39;ve already go</text>
  <text start="1733.899" dur="4.291">through approval and all these things</text>
  <text start="1736.389" dur="4.741">make it very beneficial for them to sell</text>
  <text start="1738.19" dur="4.56">vaccines and if we got rid of the</text>
  <text start="1741.13" dur="3.779">mandate I don&amp;#39;t mind if the government</text>
  <text start="1742.75" dur="3.659">wants to recommend the same vaccines</text>
  <text start="1744.909" dur="2.65">that they&amp;#39;re now mandating recommend</text>
  <text start="1746.409" dur="3.041">them all you want</text>
  <text start="1747.559" dur="4.08">but but a mother ought to have the right</text>
  <text start="1749.45" dur="4.079">to say no with no justification</text>
  <text start="1751.639" dur="4.321">whatsoever I just I don&amp;#39;t want my child</text>
  <text start="1753.529" dur="4.14">to get that back if I don&amp;#39;t get them</text>
  <text start="1755.96" dur="3.39">come steps the way it should be you know</text>
  <text start="1757.669" dur="4.021">and you know I don&amp;#39;t even think it</text>
  <text start="1759.35" dur="3.77">should be here I think it is assault I</text>
  <text start="1761.69" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t think they should be allowed to</text>
  <text start="1763.12" dur="4.659">suggest it but you know if there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1765.59" dur="4.559">force you know that&amp;#39;s one thing but now</text>
  <text start="1767.779" dur="3.63">now they&amp;#39;re panicking now they see that</text>
  <text start="1770.149" dur="2.37">they&amp;#39;re exposed now they&amp;#39;re sort of</text>
  <text start="1771.409" dur="3.181">desperate so I feel like they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1772.519" dur="4.62">to push what they can while they can</text>
  <text start="1774.59" dur="4.799">before they do right so you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1777.139" dur="3.931">there you know the FDA head comes out</text>
  <text start="1779.389" dur="3.27">against vaccines the need was fired or</text>
  <text start="1781.07" dur="4.229">step down or something but then we see</text>
  <text start="1782.659" dur="4.701">this blitz against anti-vaxxer types in</text>
  <text start="1785.299" dur="4.35">the media especially in the censorship</text>
  <text start="1787.36" dur="8.169">that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;ve seen it play out the</text>
  <text start="1789.649" dur="7.62">worst and anyone could test this I mean</text>
  <text start="1795.529" dur="3.811">you could go on and start uploading a</text>
  <text start="1797.269" dur="3.421">video about censorship and it will be</text>
  <text start="1799.34" dur="2.909">banned and your account will be flagged</text>

  <text start="1804.44" dur="4.859">this this topic is so dangerous to them</text>
  <text start="1807.379" dur="4.441">there&amp;#39;s so much liability there&amp;#39;s so</text>

  <text start="1811.82" dur="4.559">people find out that this has happened I</text>
  <text start="1814.7" dur="3.449">mean there&amp;#39;s no amount of money that</text>
  <text start="1816.379" dur="2.79">there&amp;#39;s no amount of government</text>

  <text start="2198.969" dur="4.29">very very hard for this and we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="2201.339" dur="4.38">how it comes out it could be that I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2203.259" dur="4.71">fail but I guess I&amp;#39;m trying to do sort</text>

  <text start="2287.39" dur="2.7">them in you know whatever group you want</text>
  <text start="2288.74" dur="4.52">to call it we could go into specific</text>
  <text start="2290.09" dur="6.15">actors pan and California for example</text>
  <text start="2293.26" dur="4.48">he&amp;#39;s out there pushing back he I think</text>
  <text start="2296.24" dur="4.2">he&amp;#39;s like the leader in California right</text>
  <text start="2297.74" dur="4.53">was pushing the vaccines on pay so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2300.44" dur="4.169">a bad out I mean every state has that</text>
  <text start="2302.27" dur="4.11">and then they&amp;#39;re trying to legislate</text>

  <text start="2306.38" dur="3.96">trying to come into your home as a</text>
  <text start="2307.82" dur="4.2">parents it&amp;#39;s like inspections and stuff</text>
  <text start="2310.34" dur="3.21">basically getting to a point where you</text>
  <text start="2312.02" dur="3.03">can&amp;#39;t even homeschool your children to</text>
  <text start="2313.55" dur="3.24">protect them from vaccines you know</text>
  <text start="2315.05" dur="3.39">trying to move in that direction yeah so</text>
  <text start="2316.79" dur="3.53">it&amp;#39;s all about control you know</text>
  <text start="2318.44" dur="5.07">everything else and then what happens</text>
  <text start="2320.32" dur="5.26">the children are going to suffer so I</text>
  <text start="2323.51" dur="3.51">actually I think we&amp;#39;re seeing her a bit</text>
  <text start="2325.58" dur="3.33">of a resurgence in homeschooling you</text>
  <text start="2327.02" dur="4.83">know but I was thinking that and</text>
  <text start="2328.91" dur="5.64">actually the vaccine issue is probably</text>
  <text start="2331.85" dur="4.8">helping the homeschool program and I</text>
  <text start="2334.55" dur="4.08">think homeschooling is it it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="2336.65" dur="4.08">idea especially with their internet the</text>
  <text start="2338.63" dur="4.739">way it is now is easy if parents are</text>
  <text start="2340.73" dur="4.41">willing to take the time it doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2343.369" dur="5.821">take days from indoctrination that goes</text>
  <text start="2345.14" dur="6.54">on in the public school system you know</text>
  <text start="2349.19" dur="3.84">your kids will if you if you avoid the</text>
  <text start="2351.68" dur="3.15">vaccines in the public school system</text>
  <text start="2353.03" dur="3.75">your kids are probably gonna become</text>
  <text start="2354.83" dur="3.51">geniuses I don&amp;#39;t I think they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2356.78" dur="3.18">get a better education don&amp;#39;t learn there</text>
  <text start="2358.34" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s know enough to teach them and have</text>
  <text start="2359.96" dur="4.89">enough well resources to figure out how</text>
  <text start="2362.39" dur="4.5">to how to do the education materials the</text>
  <text start="2364.85" dur="2.53">right way but there&amp;#39;s the internet and</text>
  <text start="2366.89" dur="2.169">with</text>
  <text start="2367.38" dur="4.919">online education I think that&amp;#39;s a real</text>
  <text start="2369.059" dur="4.8">blossom I think so there&amp;#39;s a one I want</text>
  <text start="2372.299" dur="2.97">to use well the Ron Paul Academy but</text>

  <text start="2375.269" dur="4.411">year it&amp;#39;s mostly self directed so</text>
  <text start="2378.359" dur="2.49">there&amp;#39;s programs out there where the kid</text>
  <text start="2379.68" dur="2.429">does mostly work where they interact</text>
  <text start="2380.849" dur="2.73">with some of the other kids in their age</text>
  <text start="2382.109" dur="3.061">group on a forum or something and to</text>
  <text start="2383.579" dur="3.21">help each other but you know teaching</text>
  <text start="2385.17" dur="4.23">and learning - while teaching it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2386.789" dur="4.8">really effective as well but kids like</text>

  <text start="2395.4" dur="2.939">know new knowledge coming in non-stop</text>
  <text start="2396.93" dur="5.04">right that&amp;#39;s why they have so much</text>

  <text start="2664.38" dur="5.61">and you know Reese that the free market</text>
  <text start="2667.32" dur="4.47">of ideas takes its nice prominence and</text>
  <text start="2669.99" dur="3.78">then the debate will take its prominence</text>
  <text start="2671.79" dur="3.54">and then it&amp;#39;s over it very quickly I</text>
  <text start="2673.77" dur="3.27">mean none of their people who show up to</text>
  <text start="2675.33" dur="4.11">a real debate of any of our leaders</text>
  <text start="2677.04" dur="4.23">fails they&amp;#39;ll do like straw man you know</text>
  <text start="2679.44" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;ll bring on like an idiot to CNN</text>

  <text start="2690.33" dur="2.21">a debate</text>
  <text start="2693.19" dur="3.43">and that&amp;#39;s kind of I think the way we</text>
  <text start="2695.42" dur="3.78">have to sort of take it is public</text>
  <text start="2696.62" dur="6.23">exposure obviously the courts won&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="2699.2" dur="6.48">us much other than the bayer situation</text>
  <text start="2702.85" dur="6.16">it&amp;#39;s exciting to me is that with the</text>
  <text start="2705.68" dur="6.06">lawsuits of privacy is coming hesitancy</text>
  <text start="2709.01" dur="8.25">on insurance advice and so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2711.74" dur="7.74">company that showed glyphosate and they</text>
  <text start="2717.26" dur="5.28">and their insurance company refused to</text>

  <text start="2722.54" dur="3.09">might be in trouble</text>
  <text start="2723.5" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s coming and then so then they</text>
  <text start="2725.63" dur="3.78">stopped selling glyphosate not because</text>
  <text start="2727.61" dur="3.99">we thought it went bad but because they</text>
  <text start="2729.41" dur="3.84">couldn&amp;#39;t afford it it&amp;#39;s funny when you</text>
  <text start="2731.6" dur="2.76">stop when you stop asking people to do</text>
  <text start="2733.25" dur="4.32">the right thing and you start hurting</text>
  <text start="2734.36" dur="5.1">their pocketbook yeah fast results yeah</text>
  <text start="2737.57" dur="4.2">like it just worked and even I think</text>
  <text start="2739.46" dur="4.2">farmers might switch to organic not</text>
  <text start="2741.77" dur="3.66">because they think life saves bad but</text>
  <text start="2743.66" dur="4.17">because there&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where the market</text>
  <text start="2745.43" dur="3.72">is you know so it should whatever reason</text>
  <text start="2747.83" dur="2.79">they&amp;#39;re gonna switch that&amp;#39;s okay with me</text>
  <text start="2749.15" dur="3.45">as long as they switch well you remember</text>
  <text start="2750.62" dur="5.79">like ten years ago or so ago it was hard</text>
  <text start="2752.6" dur="5.73">to find a great how much more is showing</text>
  <text start="2756.41" dur="7.59">up even in some regular grocery stores</text>
  <text start="2758.33" dur="7.23">yeah and then there&amp;#39;s you know I still</text>
  <text start="2764" dur="3.21">have some problems with the term as</text>
  <text start="2765.56" dur="4.26">there still didn&amp;#39;t know and some stuff</text>
  <text start="2767.21" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s not perfect but the idea that that</text>
  <text start="2769.82" dur="4.38">people want this that this is the energy</text>
  <text start="2771.62" dur="4.2">this is the desire of the the crowd so</text>
  <text start="2774.2" dur="8.97">now of course they&amp;#39;re going to cater to</text>
  <text start="2775.82" dur="8.7">it to varying degrees of honesty or if</text>
  <text start="2783.17" dur="2.85">they&amp;#39;re not watching people could</text>
  <text start="2784.52" dur="3.36">pretend it&amp;#39;s organic and give</text>
  <text start="2786.02" dur="3.6">the UI thinking goodbye with that more</text>
  <text start="2787.88" dur="3.69">people will do it always that your</text>
  <text start="2789.62" dur="3.12">problems and that&amp;#39;s why you really the</text>
  <text start="2791.57" dur="2.67">only way to know for sure is to grow</text>
  <text start="2792.74" dur="3.33">your I know that&amp;#39;s where you have to</text>
  <text start="2794.24" dur="3.51">take personal ownership it&amp;#39;s always the</text>
  <text start="2796.07" dur="5.31">heart it&amp;#39;s always the hard way is the</text>
  <text start="2797.75" dur="5.55">best way but the other thing I want to</text>
  <text start="2801.38" dur="3.57">say is cooking because we have and I</text>
  <text start="2803.3" dur="3.12">remember even when I was a child the ads</text>
  <text start="2804.95" dur="3.06">were on the TV they really into the</text>
  <text start="2806.42" dur="3.36">processed foods and there and as a</text>
  <text start="2808.01" dur="2.79">mother you should be playing in the</text>
  <text start="2809.78" dur="2.61">living room with your children you</text>
  <text start="2810.8" dur="3.78">shouldn&amp;#39;t be slaving in the kitchen you</text>
  <text start="2812.39" dur="3.87">know you you&amp;#39;re better than that you</text>
  <text start="2814.58" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t you shouldn&amp;#39;t be spending hours in</text>
  <text start="2816.26" dur="2.97">the kitchen cooking you know you you</text>
  <text start="2818" dur="3.9">just want you should just buy these</text>
  <text start="2819.23" dur="4.62">prepared meals and we&amp;#39;ll do all the</text>
  <text start="2821.9" dur="4.59">cooking for you and you can be lazy you</text>
  <text start="2823.85" dur="4.56">know and that message really caught on</text>
  <text start="2826.49" dur="3.99">to the point where women we&amp;#39;re sort of</text>
  <text start="2828.41" dur="4.62">didn&amp;#39;t want to admit that they spent</text>
  <text start="2830.48" dur="5.43">time you know and whereas I think</text>
  <text start="2833.03" dur="4.92">cooking is actually one of them more fun</text>
  <text start="2835.91" dur="4.16">things to do if things you could be</text>
  <text start="2837.95" dur="4.5">doing cooking it&amp;#39;s not an unpleasant</text>

  <text start="2888.71" dur="3.36">entertaining that a lot of stuff just a</text>
  <text start="2890.12" dur="3.83">bunch of talk of Talking Heads it</text>
  <text start="2892.07" dur="4.35">actually has a family that they follow</text>
  <text start="2893.95" dur="4.36">over the course of the movie and they</text>
  <text start="2896.42" dur="4.07">start off with two parents and two kids</text>
  <text start="2898.31" dur="5.18">and everybody&amp;#39;s got different sicknesses</text>

  <text start="2903.49" dur="4.05">organic diet the whole family and and</text>
  <text start="2906.28" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s the major change that they made</text>
  <text start="2907.54" dur="3.57">and then at the end of the movie</text>
  <text start="2909.25" dur="3.36">everybody has that has healed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2911.11" dur="2.25">really quite remarkable it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2912.61" dur="3.45">true story</text>
  <text start="2913.36" dur="4.17">the true family so it&amp;#39;s quite quite neat</text>
  <text start="2916.06" dur="2.55">and then there&amp;#39;s other there are some</text>
  <text start="2917.53" dur="2.97">Talking Heads and there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="2918.61" dur="4.98">information but it&amp;#39;s focused on fly</text>
  <text start="2920.5" dur="4.74">fishing you know there&amp;#39;s there are a few</text>
  <text start="2923.59" dur="3.21">big things I think life estates one of</text>
  <text start="2925.24" dur="3.9">them because they just spray everywhere</text>
  <text start="2926.8" dur="5.67">mercury kind of the fluoride a few big</text>
  <text start="2929.14" dur="5.31">ones obviously the vaccines we could</text>
  <text start="2932.47" dur="4.5">knock out those it&amp;#39;s gonna be like a</text>
  <text start="2934.45" dur="4.38">health explosion I don&amp;#39;t know would it</text>
  <text start="2936.97" dur="3.63">be amazing if we just got rid of the</text>
  <text start="2938.83" dur="4.8">vaccines and got music life is a I think</text>
  <text start="2940.6" dur="4.47">we just got rid of those two we&amp;#39;d see</text>
  <text start="2943.63" dur="3.72">huge differences and the other thing I</text>
  <text start="2945.07" dur="4.62">want to say is that it&amp;#39;s probably a good</text>
  <text start="2947.35" dur="5.07">idea not to do something to subs with</text>
  <text start="2949.69" dur="6.179">the vaccines you know if we do it slowly</text>
  <text start="2952.42" dur="4.98">by allowing those people who decide not</text>
  <text start="2955.869" dur="2.191">to get vaccinated just if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2957.4" dur="4.09">good</text>
  <text start="2958.06" dur="6.04">larger unvaccinated community hopefully</text>
  <text start="2961.49" dur="5.04">they will be significantly healthier</text>

  <text start="2966.53" dur="3.78">get some of these diseases and die from</text>
  <text start="2968.96" dur="3.15">them that you know because we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2970.31" dur="4.23">what&amp;#39;s going to happen if we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2972.11" dur="6.06">the good side of vaccines we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2974.54" dur="5.88">how much that&amp;#39;s doing for us we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2978.17" dur="4.53">know and we could find out that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2980.42" dur="5.76">I mean I suspect that it&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="2982.7" dur="5.46">anything but I don&amp;#39;t know we we all have</text>
  <text start="2986.18" dur="3.78">those people who who decide not to</text>
  <text start="2988.16" dur="4.47">vaccinate will be an example that will</text>
  <text start="2989.96" dur="4.11">be said to others when they see that</text>
  <text start="2992.63" dur="3.81">their children are so healthy</text>
  <text start="2994.07" dur="3.69">what I hope is then more people will buy</text>
  <text start="2996.44" dur="3.95">in and we&amp;#39;ll do a gradual transition</text>

  <text start="3146.859" dur="4.351">tell her you loved it was good you know</text>
  <text start="3148.72" dur="4.26">just the active love that that was put</text>
  <text start="3151.21" dur="4.74">into that and the active labor that goes</text>
  <text start="3152.98" dur="4.47">into that I mean that alarm I mean plus</text>
  <text start="3155.95" dur="3.659">you probably save money on restaurants</text>
  <text start="3157.45" dur="4.409">and stuff these processed foods I mean</text>
  <text start="3159.609" dur="4.431">we know about foods I mean they have a</text>
  <text start="3161.859" dur="6.371">lot of issues besides as I say</text>
  <text start="3164.04" dur="8.22">I grew up on hot pockets and roses yeah</text>
  <text start="3168.23" dur="5.5">oh yeah I got out of some bad health</text>
  <text start="3172.26" dur="7.29">habits but you know no one knew any</text>
  <text start="3173.73" dur="7.8">better I&amp;#39;m not give me candy so sugar is</text>
  <text start="3179.55" dur="3.6">another one of those big big poisons</text>
  <text start="3181.53" dur="3.69">that we have to kind of get help that</text>
  <text start="3183.15" dur="3.63">people just they don&amp;#39;t really appreciate</text>
  <text start="3185.22" dur="2.7">the damage it does to their health is</text>
  <text start="3186.78" dur="5.49">probably one of the worst foods out</text>
  <text start="3187.92" dur="6.39">there actually just a plain old sugar so</text>
  <text start="3192.27" dur="4.2">you know you&amp;#39;ve got this book coming out</text>
  <text start="3194.31" dur="3.78">you said next January</text>
  <text start="3196.47" dur="2.94">well next January I will complete a</text>
  <text start="3198.09" dur="4.25">draft and then it&amp;#39;s gonna have to go</text>
  <text start="3199.41" dur="7.29">through some editing to this train right</text>
  <text start="3202.34" dur="5.29">unintelligible science of that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3206.7" dur="5.4">know how long that would take</text>
  <text start="3207.63" dur="6.66">I certainly am eager to get it out it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3212.1" dur="3.96">a big task where do you think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3214.29" dur="6.78">where our focus right now</text>
  <text start="3216.06" dur="6.87">you think the next big break is we have</text>
  <text start="3221.07" dur="4.41">the big monsanto thing that&amp;#39;s obviously</text>
  <text start="3222.93" dur="4.86">you know kind of a bombshell what do you</text>
  <text start="3225.48" dur="5.22">think the next one is it&amp;#39;s coming well I</text>
  <text start="3227.79" dur="6.18">mean what I&amp;#39;m doing personally it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="3230.7" dur="4.86">the glyphosate the theory that I have</text>
  <text start="3233.97" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s very specific but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3235.56" dur="5.79">important that I see an analogue way</text>
  <text start="3238.38" dur="5.31">that you buy pezzini&amp;#39;s toxics in my</text>
  <text start="3241.35" dur="4.02">opinion needs to become fact we need to</text>
  <text start="3243.69" dur="4.44">prove we need to have the chemist prove</text>
  <text start="3245.37" dur="5.46">that it&amp;#39;s happening beyond a doubt and</text>
  <text start="3248.13" dur="7.47">we need to get some population aware</text>
  <text start="3250.83" dur="8.07">that it&amp;#39;s happening very neatly toxic</text>
  <text start="3255.6" dur="4.92">okay so when you say that like getting</text>
  <text start="3258.9" dur="3.69">big kind of getting out the research and</text>
  <text start="3260.52" dur="4.68">stop it it would seem like an easy thing</text>
  <text start="3262.59" dur="4.32">to do I mean you should be able to study</text>
  <text start="3265.2" dur="3.09">this and reproduce some things and share</text>
  <text start="3266.91" dur="3.3">it and then people can get to the idea</text>
  <text start="3268.29" dur="3.12">very quickly you know community of</text>
  <text start="3270.21" dur="3.39">scientists will I would have thought so</text>
  <text start="3271.41" dur="4.05">I mean it&amp;#39;s very frustrating because I</text>
  <text start="3273.6" dur="4.53">feel like if anybody who knows and</text>
  <text start="3275.46" dur="5.33">that&amp;#39;s a biology or chemistry looks at</text>
  <text start="3278.13" dur="6.39">the data that&amp;#39;s available on the web to</text>
  <text start="3280.79" dur="5.65">fit this puzzle and to explain this</text>
  <text start="3284.52" dur="4.05">theory that I have they will see that it</text>
  <text start="3286.44" dur="3.75">works really really well with all the</text>
  <text start="3288.57" dur="4.29">evidence and it makes a very strong case</text>
  <text start="3290.19" dur="4.59">but instead what&amp;#39;s happening is that</text>
  <text start="3292.86" dur="4.04">there&amp;#39;s tremendous denial that it even</text>
  <text start="3294.78" dur="5.48">could happen the thing that I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="3296.9" dur="6.26">just a substitution precisely there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3300.26" dur="5.91">tremendous denial that it&amp;#39;s possible and</text>
  <text start="3303.16" dur="4.99">apparently either the chemists are</text>
  <text start="3306.17" dur="3.18">afraid of Monsanto they won&amp;#39;t do that or</text>
  <text start="3308.15" dur="2.94">they&amp;#39;re afraid they&amp;#39;ll lose all their</text>
  <text start="3309.35" dur="3.99">funding if they do the research or maybe</text>
  <text start="3311.09" dur="3.6">they don&amp;#39;t they believe that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3313.34" dur="4.11">possible and therefore they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3314.69" dur="4.89">willing to waste money you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3317.45" dur="3.87">know because I need a chemist there&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3319.58" dur="3.21">always how to do the experiment to do</text>
  <text start="3321.32" dur="3.75">the experiment that would definitively</text>
  <text start="3322.79" dur="4.35">prove that what I&amp;#39;m saying is happening</text>
  <text start="3325.07" dur="4.29">is happening hey you chemists out there</text>
  <text start="3327.14" dur="4.35">and that&amp;#39;s what I need I&amp;#39;d love to see</text>
  <text start="3329.36" dur="3.78">that happen because I think if if it</text>
  <text start="3331.49" dur="5.13">becomes clear that this is happening</text>
  <text start="3333.14" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s game over it makes it really the</text>
  <text start="3336.62" dur="3.33">most topic I would love to help that is</text>
  <text start="3338.06" dur="3.78">any way that I can try to find a chemist</text>
  <text start="3339.95" dur="4.77">guys if there&amp;#39;s a chemist out there</text>
  <text start="3341.84" dur="4.11">reach out you know this is an issue that</text>
  <text start="3344.72" dur="3.09">we could certainly do it what do you</text>
  <text start="3345.95" dur="4.59">what do you think in terms of you know</text>
  <text start="3347.81" dur="4.23">medical journals and stuff like what</text>
  <text start="3350.54" dur="3.54">kind of reaction would you get if you</text>
  <text start="3352.04" dur="3.78">were to drop of some of your studies or</text>
  <text start="3354.08" dur="3.81">your evidence from a glyphosate thing</text>
  <text start="3355.82" dur="3.93">into a traditional medical drone I mean</text>
  <text start="3357.89" dur="2.46">I basically can&amp;#39;t because we just need</text>
  <text start="3359.75" dur="2.25">to take it</text>
  <text start="3360.35" dur="2.94">they won&amp;#39;t even I mean these days they</text>
  <text start="3362" dur="3.21">hardly even will ever send it off for</text>
  <text start="3363.29" dur="2.71">review and if they do they always find a</text>
  <text start="3365.21" dur="2.53">reviewer</text>
  <text start="3366" dur="5.55">completely determined to make sure that</text>
  <text start="3367.74" dur="6">it won&amp;#39;t publish itself there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3371.55" dur="4.83">concerted effort I think you make sure</text>
  <text start="3373.74" dur="5.34">that this doesn&amp;#39;t isn&amp;#39;t allowed</text>
  <text start="3376.38" dur="4.17">legitimacy so we&amp;#39;re in a position where</text>
  <text start="3379.08" dur="3.9">they control all of the sources of</text>
  <text start="3380.55" dur="3.66">authority and then they&amp;#39;re therefore you</text>
  <text start="3382.98" dur="4.98">know what what do we have we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="3384.21" dur="5.88">nothing left except complaints how you</text>
  <text start="3387.96" dur="3.93">know if there was a way that we could</text>
  <text start="3390.09" dur="3.96">get around that like you maybe we had a</text>
  <text start="3391.89" dur="3.93">free speech to medical tourism like that</text>
  <text start="3394.05" dur="3.42">would that be something that you think</text>
  <text start="3395.82" dur="4.53">would would help affect some change I</text>
  <text start="3397.47" dur="4.83">think you know there are in fact you</text>
  <text start="3400.35" dur="5.16">know a lot of journals sprouting up that</text>
  <text start="3402.3" dur="4.83">are open access a sort of outside of the</text>
  <text start="3405.51" dur="5.16">mainstream and so they&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="3407.13" dur="5.63">they&amp;#39;re painted as predatory journals</text>
  <text start="3410.67" dur="4.11">you know they&amp;#39;re depicted as being scum</text>
  <text start="3412.76" dur="3.64">but they&amp;#39;re publishing really</text>
  <text start="3414.78" dur="3.9">interesting research I&amp;#39;m finding some</text>
  <text start="3416.4" dur="4.23">very nice some of these theories of</text>
  <text start="3418.68" dur="3.78">people working out history the science</text>
  <text start="3420.63" dur="4.26">are so confrontational but the really</text>
  <text start="3422.46" dur="3.72">interesting theories that are trying to</text>
  <text start="3424.89" dur="2.85">synthesize to the highest level and</text>
  <text start="3426.18" dur="3.98">figure out how the biology is working</text>
  <text start="3427.74" dur="5.55">are typically showing up in these</text>
  <text start="3430.16" dur="5.32">obscure journals because I think the</text>
  <text start="3433.29" dur="4.44">mainstream is restricting what is</text>
  <text start="3435.48" dur="4.83">allowed to show there they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="3437.73" dur="4.17">understand what&amp;#39;s actually happening it</text>
  <text start="3440.31" dur="4.5">feels like and therefore they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3441.9" dur="4.53">publish I don&amp;#39;t hate birds that are</text>
  <text start="3444.81" dur="3.87">revealing with him I won&amp;#39;t the the</text>
  <text start="3446.43" dur="3.45">mainstream we&amp;#39;re about to cut off it I</text>
  <text start="3448.68" dur="4.92">guess in a second we&amp;#39;re gonna go with</text>
  <text start="3449.88" dur="8.07">always to finish the thought briefly why</text>
  <text start="3453.6" dur="8.1">won&amp;#39;t the mainstream medical journal</text>
  <text start="3457.95" dur="6.24">types respond to those those things are</text>
  <text start="3461.7" dur="4.23">out there he&amp;#39;s let lesser-known but</text>
  <text start="3464.19" dur="3.54">still like the sciences they&amp;#39;re like you</text>
  <text start="3465.93" dur="3.99">so technically reproduce it that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="3467.73" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s a no I mean I&amp;#39;m I</text>
  <text start="3469.92" dur="4.77">puzzled at how restricted the science is</text>
  <text start="3472.29" dur="4.019">at this point there so you know you have</text>
  <text start="3474.69" dur="4.74">certain boundaries that you have to stay</text>
  <text start="3476.309" dur="6.29">within which prevents you from having</text>
  <text start="3479.43" dur="5.73">those big breaks each there&amp;#39;s sort of a</text>
  <text start="3482.599" dur="7.21">whole parrot we need a major paradigm</text>
  <text start="3485.16" dur="6.959">shift we do and and we resist that the</text>
  <text start="3489.809" dur="6.331">people who think they have the answers</text>
  <text start="3492.119" dur="7.47">won&amp;#39;t let other ideas they can restrict</text>
  <text start="3496.14" dur="4.949">the the idea generation process by</text>
