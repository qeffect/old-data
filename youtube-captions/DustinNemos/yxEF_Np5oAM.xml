  <text start="95.009" dur="6.391">dinner and it was a great group of folks</text>
  <text start="98.1" dur="4.68">and a lot of good guys in one room I saw</text>
  <text start="101.4" dur="3.539">some of the comments and the pictures</text>
  <text start="102.78" dur="4.65">like that&amp;#39;s a lot of good in one room</text>
  <text start="104.939" dur="5.131">it is it is there was a lot of influence</text>
  <text start="107.43" dur="5.399">together in one place and you know</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="6">behind this movement and this is a small</text>
  <text start="112.829" dur="5.82">small percentage of the total so you</text>
  <text start="116.07" dur="5.7">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s fun but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="118.649" dur="6.15">also going to be a important day to to</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="5.55">make sort of a statement after all these</text>
  <text start="124.799" dur="4.041">mass shootings after all these whatever</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="4.169">you want to call them these these bogus</text>
  <text start="128.84" dur="4.63">events or maybe they really happened and</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="3.931">there&amp;#39;s more to the story or</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="3.87">just super convenient for the Democrats</text>
  <text start="135.42" dur="4.08">because they&amp;#39;re always trying to switch</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="4.22">from talking about actual crimes that</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;ve committed to these weird</text>
  <text start="141.56" dur="4.42">nonsensical things like Q and on being</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="4.17">violent things like that you&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="3.48">heard a post call for violence from Q</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="2.94">and on you&amp;#39;ve never heard any of the</text>
  <text start="149.46" dur="4.65">leaders of the human call for violence</text>
  <text start="151.2" dur="5.22">but if one person does a violent act</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="4.41">even though they might be perhaps like</text>
  <text start="156.42" dur="4.26">an auntie feh or or a leftist or</text>
  <text start="158.52" dur="4.89">something like that they&amp;#39;re always going</text>
  <text start="160.68" dur="4.5">to link it back to hm now remember it</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="4.92">didn&amp;#39;t used to be a chain it used to be</text>
  <text start="165.18" dur="4.77">Trump magazine people the mag of people</text>
  <text start="168.33" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re crazy they&amp;#39;re violent they show</text>
  <text start="169.95" dur="4.71">up to rallies and start problems right</text>
  <text start="171.69" dur="4.92">no that&amp;#39;s never what happened they spent</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="3.42">over two years trying to convince us</text>
  <text start="176.61" dur="3.87">that the Madiga movement was one of</text>
  <text start="178.08" dur="3.41">racism and violence and hate and you</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="4.44">know the drill</text>
  <text start="181.49" dur="4.84">same thing today now they&amp;#39;ve switched</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="2.85">her tracking the cueing on movement</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="3.24">because they know they can&amp;#39;t be Trump</text>
  <text start="187.77" dur="3.42">and there are still people confused</text>
  <text start="189.57" dur="3.93">about Q there&amp;#39;s still people who are</text>
  <text start="191.19" dur="4.56">confused about what it is what it means</text>
  <text start="193.5" dur="5.16">and then there are people thanks to the</text>
  <text start="195.75" dur="5.459">likes of CNN and others that now fear Q</text>
  <text start="198.66" dur="6.48">as some sort of a violent movement when</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="6.211">it isn&amp;#39;t and of course the vast majority</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="5.16">people either don&amp;#39;t know about you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="207.42" dur="4.71">care but people who are politically Alok</text>
  <text start="210.3" dur="3.84">I would say the politically active folks</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="5.67">which is probably less than 10% of the</text>
  <text start="214.14" dur="6.36">population if that those folks largely</text>
  <text start="217.8" dur="4.32">heard about Q to some level and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.5" dur="3.51">the best of people we actually have to</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="5.089">reach those of the tireless minority</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="5.82">that will actually make something happen</text>
  <text start="227.209" dur="4.991">you know never never doubt that a small</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="3.81">group of committed people can change the</text>
  <text start="232.2" dur="4.259">world indeed it&amp;#39;s the only thing that</text>
  <text start="233.64" dur="5.19">ever has so I&amp;#39;m going to leave you guys</text>
  <text start="236.459" dur="5.071">with that quote and I&amp;#39;ll see you guys at</text>
  <text start="238.83" dur="4.77">the rally if you&amp;#39;re here and if not then</text>
  <text start="241.53" dur="4.28">afterwards back on the channel I&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="243.6" dur="2.21">you soon</text>
