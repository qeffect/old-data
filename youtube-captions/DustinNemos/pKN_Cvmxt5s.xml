  <text start="13.559" dur="5.021">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="16.24" dur="4.89">Deimos and we have a lot to go through</text>
  <text start="18.58" dur="5.64">today not only do you have all of these</text>
  <text start="21.13" dur="5.52">new cue posts we are going to go through</text>
  <text start="24.22" dur="3.87">those as well but before we do that I</text>
  <text start="26.65" dur="4.32">want to talk about a couple other things</text>
  <text start="28.09" dur="6.38">okay I have a list of cue relevant</text>
  <text start="30.97" dur="5.97">things to talk about first of those is</text>
  <text start="34.47" dur="3.46">Steven Wasserman the brother of Debbie</text>
  <text start="36.94" dur="3.99">wasserman-schultz</text>
  <text start="37.93" dur="5.43">is going to oversee the Ã¥land family</text>
  <text start="40.93" dur="4.469">investigation a 1 whatever I don&amp;#39;t not</text>
  <text start="43.36" dur="5.15">pronounce it the Awan family</text>
  <text start="45.399" dur="6.44">investigation now this is interestingly</text>
  <text start="48.51" dur="5.2">are interesting because she&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="51.839" dur="3.641">implicated in the Elan family</text>
  <text start="53.71" dur="5.489">investigation so her brother is</text>
  <text start="55.48" dur="5.07">investigating her okay and this is you</text>
  <text start="59.199" dur="3.39">know probably the woman that&amp;#39;s behind</text>
  <text start="60.55" dur="3.78">Seth Ridge being murdered and she is</text>
  <text start="62.589" dur="3.511">corrupt as it comes she basically</text>
  <text start="64.33" dur="3.54">threatened Capitol Police to get her in</text>
  <text start="66.1" dur="4.05">for me like her computers back all kinds</text>
  <text start="67.87" dur="5.13">of stuff going on with this woman and it</text>
  <text start="70.15" dur="4.29">gets even more interesting okay listen</text>
  <text start="73" dur="6.27">to this it gets even more interesting</text>
  <text start="74.44" dur="7.53">than that all right what else is going</text>
  <text start="79.27" dur="5.13">on okay there&amp;#39;s an FBI agent if the AI</text>
  <text start="81.97" dur="5.04">agent wiesen it who ended up dead on a</text>
  <text start="84.4" dur="4.89">beach his body washed ashore guess who</text>
  <text start="87.01" dur="4.95">investigated it Broward County guess</text>
  <text start="89.29" dur="4.14">whose County that are guess whose</text>
  <text start="91.96" dur="2.46">district that is in Debbie</text>
  <text start="93.43" dur="6.06">wasserman-schultz</text>
  <text start="94.42" dur="6.93">so we now have another second death of</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="4.23">suspicious nature linked to Debbie</text>
  <text start="101.35" dur="3.81">wasserman-schultz linked to a coverup</text>
  <text start="103.72" dur="4.47">and what was this FBI agent</text>
  <text start="105.16" dur="5.69">investigating in Ron awan and Debbie</text>
  <text start="108.19" dur="6.12">wasserman-schultz</text>
  <text start="110.85" dur="7.63">so not only does this further implicate</text>
  <text start="114.31" dur="6">her own probable guilt but it also</text>
  <text start="118.48" dur="3.72">brings into question everything that</text>
  <text start="120.31" dur="4.05">comes out of Florida now we have a very</text>
  <text start="122.2" dur="5.37">corrupt sheriff down there he&amp;#39;s had 66</text>
  <text start="124.36" dur="5.31">plus criminal investigations into his</text>
  <text start="127.57" dur="4.59">own people and they basically get a slap</text>
  <text start="129.67" dur="5.91">on the wrist and then I let off without</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="6.24">without much punishment because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="135.58" dur="5.46">above the law obviously but not only is</text>
  <text start="138.4" dur="5.699">his office incredibly corrupt not only</text>
  <text start="141.04" dur="5.08">is his history incredibly corrupt</text>
  <text start="144.099" dur="5.22">everything going on with this far to</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="7.47">school shooting is very much in question</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="5.95">okay everything it&amp;#39;s obviously an</text>
  <text start="153.59" dur="3.869">attempt to manipulate and push an agenda</text>
  <text start="155.269" dur="4.95">they are they are pulling out all stops</text>
  <text start="157.459" dur="4.821">and debbie Wasserman Schultz is right</text>
  <text start="160.219" dur="6.681">there in the thick of it folks</text>
  <text start="162.28" dur="7.81">so I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="166.9" dur="4.809">I&amp;#39;m gonna call BS on Roger stone having</text>
  <text start="170.09" dur="4.2">kind of vouched for this sheriff this</text>
  <text start="171.709" dur="4.411">sheriff is corrupt as hell and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="3.11">self-evident for anyone who bothers to</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="5.399">look into it for more than five minutes</text>
  <text start="177.4" dur="5.739">so you know I am generally a fan of</text>
  <text start="181.519" dur="5.28">Roger stone he seems to be a pretty hard</text>
  <text start="183.139" dur="6.451">hitter but in this case you know I think</text>
  <text start="186.799" dur="7.05">we need to we need to take anything he</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="5.489">says with a grain of salt as well so you</text>
  <text start="193.849" dur="3.601">know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of questions</text>
  <text start="195.079" dur="4.621">around this Florida stuff will so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="197.45" dur="4.259">get into that as well okay and we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="199.7" dur="6.179">we&amp;#39;re not done with the MKULTRA topic</text>
  <text start="201.709" dur="6.21">either on the MKULTRA topic there was a</text>
  <text start="205.879" dur="4.411">man that committed suicide outside of</text>
  <text start="207.919" dur="6.66">the White House fence and he first shot</text>
  <text start="210.29" dur="9.569">his phone why would you shoot your phone</text>
  <text start="214.579" dur="7.08">before shooting yourself well and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="219.859" dur="3.21">sure you know what I imagine that cue is</text>
  <text start="221.659" dur="2.881">gonna mention something about this in</text>
  <text start="223.069" dur="7.861">the post without even having read them</text>
  <text start="224.54" dur="8.789">yet but I think that this is a warning I</text>
  <text start="230.93" dur="6.479">think this is a warning shot saying we</text>
  <text start="233.329" dur="5.671">can get to you or were this close to you</text>
  <text start="237.409" dur="3.54">you know now Trump wasn&amp;#39;t even in the</text>
  <text start="239" dur="4.199">White House at the time but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="240.949" dur="4.28">necessary for a warning shot like we can</text>
  <text start="243.199" dur="4.35">get to you you know we&amp;#39;ve seen women</text>
  <text start="245.229" dur="4.9">another woman try to scale the fence</text>
  <text start="247.549" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;ve seen one that tried to I think get</text>
  <text start="250.129" dur="5.64">in with like ramming her car or</text>
  <text start="251.659" dur="5.971">something and into the like the gate</text>
  <text start="255.769" dur="5.43">something like that I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="257.63" dur="4.98">details so it could well be that they</text>
  <text start="261.199" dur="3.75">are triggering him killed four</text>
  <text start="262.61" dur="3.989">operatives with cellphones which you</text>
  <text start="264.949" dur="3.541">know I&amp;#39;ve gone over I&amp;#39;ve shown you the</text>
  <text start="266.599" dur="4.201">the patents and them it sounds crazy but</text>
  <text start="268.49" dur="4.739">I&amp;#39;ve shown you patents in my past videos</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="3.81">about this topic I went through and I</text>
  <text start="273.229" dur="3.701">showed you over a dozen patents where</text>
  <text start="274.61" dur="4.99">they can influence the brain waves with</text>
  <text start="276.93" dur="6.84">electrical signals from for example</text>
  <text start="279.6" dur="6.659">cellphones so something out of a sci-fi</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="4.44">movie something that sounds crazy sounds</text>
  <text start="286.259" dur="5.761">like something in the matrix or or</text>
  <text start="288.21" dur="5.25">something like that but truth is</text>
  <text start="292.02" dur="1.92">stranger than fiction folks what can I</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="2.519">say</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="3.3">sometimes your reality is way crazier</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="5.391">than anything that can think of in the</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="6.269">movies and this is one of those times so</text>
  <text start="301.37" dur="4.15">you know as I understand it and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="303.509" dur="4.771">definitely not an expert on what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="305.52" dur="5.97">classified technologies they have as I</text>
  <text start="308.28" dur="6.09">understand it you can&amp;#39;t just take a pass</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="5.79">a lifelong pacifist and turn them into a</text>
  <text start="314.37" dur="5.94">serial murderer okay but you can take</text>
  <text start="317.28" dur="6.99">someone who&amp;#39;s emotionally weakened or a</text>
  <text start="320.31" dur="7.229">fragile or unstable and you can trigger</text>
  <text start="324.27" dur="5.64">parts of their brain to make them become</text>
  <text start="327.539" dur="4.38">bad or to make them go into a rage or to</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="4.86">make them carry out certain things I</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="4.801">don&amp;#39;t know exactly how it works we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="3.72">all seen that or well you may not have</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="4.62">yet seen it but many of us have seen</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="6.12">that movie the Kingsmen where they were</text>
  <text start="341.34" dur="4.829">able to the bad guy was able to trigger</text>
  <text start="344.61" dur="3.27">everyone with a cell phone</text>
  <text start="346.169" dur="3.901">across the entire planet and the whole</text>
  <text start="347.88" dur="3.9">planet started killing each other it was</text>
  <text start="350.07" dur="3.77">actually kind of comedic the way they</text>
  <text start="351.78" dur="5.609">did it you know it was funny there was</text>
  <text start="353.84" dur="5.199">music playing and but this is kind of</text>
  <text start="357.389" dur="3.9">where they want to be able to go folks</text>
  <text start="359.039" dur="5.16">this is that movie had a lot of truths</text>
  <text start="361.289" dur="5.37">in it let&amp;#39;s all go hide out in a bunker</text>
  <text start="364.199" dur="4.56">for the elite while the plebs kill</text>
  <text start="366.659" dur="4.651">themselves and then we can lower the</text>
  <text start="368.759" dur="5.91">population you know look at the Georgia</text>
  <text start="371.31" dur="4.8">Guidestones they they are they have been</text>
  <text start="374.669" dur="3.12">planning and plotting for this for a</text>
  <text start="376.11" dur="3">long time they want to lower the</text>
  <text start="377.789" dur="4.051">population so that they can more easily</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="5.7">control us they want to go back to a</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="6.829">feudalist system with masters and kings</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="3.859">and slaves and serfs</text>
  <text start="389.61" dur="7.589">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a wild ride we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="394.259" dur="6.601">folks it is a wild ride we&amp;#39;re on now I</text>
  <text start="397.199" dur="5.43">also want to mention Q has said boom and</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="3.119">when I did I did read a couple things</text>
  <text start="402.629" dur="3.331">that people had posted I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="403.979" dur="4.231">actually gone through his post yet but</text>
  <text start="405.96" dur="5.69">he did say boom and then Elon Musk says</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="7.199">boom twice in a tweet also it is</text>
  <text start="411.65" dur="4.78">military tribunal Awareness Month so you</text>
  <text start="415.409" dur="2.461">know most people don&amp;#39;t know what that</text>
  <text start="416.43" dur="4.199">means they don&amp;#39;t know what a military</text>
  <text start="417.87" dur="4.41">tribunal really is we need to we need to</text>
  <text start="420.629" dur="3.211">spread the word about that make it kind</text>
  <text start="422.28" dur="4.41">of a household phrase you know let</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="4.68">everyone know that phrase let them</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="6.719">understand what a military tribunal is</text>
  <text start="428.52" dur="6.81">now on that note I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="433.409" dur="4.25">step away from the Q stuff for a second</text>
  <text start="435.33" dur="5.25">and talk from a freedom perspective</text>
  <text start="437.659" dur="5.891">military tribunals are a slippery slope</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="4.53">to tyranny now I think that they are</text>
  <text start="443.55" dur="5.07">necessary in this case because the</text>
  <text start="445.11" dur="5.07">civilian courts are so corrupted if you</text>
  <text start="448.62" dur="3.299">had asked me two years ago I would say</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s nothing that can be done to</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="6.87">change the inevitable collapse of our</text>
  <text start="453.96" dur="8.9">society because it is so decadent so far</text>
  <text start="458.789" dur="7.44">gone down the path of corruption that</text>
  <text start="462.86" dur="5.35">nothing could change it now with q and</text>
  <text start="466.229" dur="3.87">on and Trump I think we have a shot I</text>
  <text start="468.21" dur="5.609">think we have a chance to avoid collapse</text>
  <text start="470.099" dur="6.54">and disaster but just because a good guy</text>
  <text start="473.819" dur="5.011">is in charge right now and we have good</text>
  <text start="476.639" dur="5.161">guys that are helping him out does not</text>
  <text start="478.83" dur="5.66">mean that we want the government it does</text>
  <text start="481.8" dur="6.119">not mean that we want unrestrained</text>
  <text start="484.49" dur="6.19">authoritarianism so we need these right</text>
  <text start="487.919" dur="4.911">now but we should not treat them like a</text>
  <text start="490.68" dur="7.889">good thing we should treat them like a</text>
  <text start="492.83" dur="8.019">dangerous snake a poisonous serpent we</text>
  <text start="498.569" dur="3.53">should treat them like a dayne danger to</text>
  <text start="500.849" dur="4.861">freedom and that&amp;#39;s what they are</text>
  <text start="502.099" dur="6.1">military tribunals in lieu of civilian</text>
  <text start="505.71" dur="4.549">courts bypassing rights things like the</text>
  <text start="508.199" dur="9.03">Patriot Act these are all still bad guys</text>
  <text start="510.259" dur="10.09">these are all still evil I I understand</text>
  <text start="517.229" dur="4.581">the need for Trump to use things like</text>
  <text start="520.349" dur="3.471">the Patriot Act I</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="4.67">against the people that made it which is</text>
  <text start="523.82" dur="6.81">kind of a poetic justice to that right</text>
  <text start="526.48" dur="8.17">kind of an ironical karmic sense of</text>
  <text start="530.63" dur="6.12">humor you know but I I don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
  <text start="534.65" dur="5.37">to go into this thinking raw military</text>
  <text start="536.75" dur="6.089">raw this is good this is still a</text>
  <text start="540.02" dur="4.17">dangerous slippery slope now with that</text>
  <text start="542.839" dur="6.511">said I&amp;#39;m gonna jump back into the queue</text>
  <text start="544.19" dur="8.79">stuff okay so tomorrow is the potential</text>
  <text start="549.35" dur="6.27">crisis actor event where we saw a</text>
  <text start="552.98" dur="5.46">Craigslist ad being posted for $1,000 a</text>
  <text start="555.62" dur="5.969">day page ah payday for anyone who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="558.44" dur="7.32">crisis actor that applied for it so we</text>
  <text start="561.589" dur="6.331">have and this was in Texas so we have</text>
  <text start="565.76" dur="6.36">the potential for a false flag tomorrow</text>
  <text start="567.92" dur="6.06">in Texas we had a point of evidence</text>
  <text start="572.12" dur="4.08">which was the Craigslist ad suggesting</text>
  <text start="573.98" dur="4.35">that it was being planned at least and</text>
  <text start="576.2" dur="4.02">we don&amp;#39;t know if something is literally</text>
  <text start="578.33" dur="3.36">gonna happen or if they they backed off</text>
  <text start="580.22" dur="4.98">for what we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t know maybe</text>
  <text start="581.69" dur="5.19">they were stopped or maybe they maybe it</text>
  <text start="585.2" dur="3.24">was just BS from the beginning we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="586.88" dur="4.56">seen a lot of these ads where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="588.44" dur="4.68">recruiting crisis actors in the past you</text>
  <text start="591.44" dur="4.5">know it seems like every time there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="593.12" dur="4.14">big protest they recruit protesters for</text>
  <text start="595.94" dur="4.14">two to three hundred dollars a day as</text>
  <text start="597.26" dur="7.82">well you know that George Soros money</text>
  <text start="600.08" dur="8.25">goes real far he&amp;#39;s got a lot of it so</text>
  <text start="605.08" dur="4.99">we&amp;#39;ll see I&amp;#39;m hoping that I&amp;#39;m wrong and</text>
  <text start="608.33" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m hoping that nothing happens tomorrow</text>
  <text start="610.07" dur="4.53">but if it does happen you&amp;#39;ll know that</text>
  <text start="612.17" dur="4.29">it was BS because we predicted it and</text>
  <text start="614.6" dur="3.51">the only way we could predict an event</text>
  <text start="616.46" dur="6.24">like that as if it was planned ahead and</text>
  <text start="618.11" dur="7.47">somebody had been too stupid so we were</text>
  <text start="622.7" dur="4.889">able to find them you know generally</text>
  <text start="625.58" dur="6.18">speaking they rely on people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="627.589" dur="6.241">incredulity and you know the complexity</text>
  <text start="631.76" dur="3.9">of the lie to protect them they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="633.83" dur="3.629">really rely on secrecy all the time</text>
  <text start="635.66" dur="3.72">because a lot of these things aren&amp;#39;t</text>
