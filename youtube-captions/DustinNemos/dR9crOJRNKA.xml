  <text start="8.94" dur="4.739">limited one of my videos I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="11.46" dur="4.98">exactly what limited means I think that</text>
  <text start="13.679" dur="3.991">means that you can find it with the link</text>
  <text start="16.44" dur="2.78">but you&amp;#39;re not gonna be able to find it</text>
  <text start="17.67" dur="3.93">in the search or anything like that</text>
  <text start="19.22" dur="6.969">of course I will appeal it and of course</text>
  <text start="21.6" dur="7.23">they will reject that appeal so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="26.189" dur="5.87">going to include some images at the end</text>

  <text start="117.75" dur="5.369">everything how they&amp;#39;ve had explosive</text>
  <text start="120.6" dur="6.449">growth and we know why that is directly</text>
  <text start="123.119" dur="5.431">because of the the mass purge you know a</text>
  <text start="127.049" dur="3.841">lot of the youtubers mentioned D tube</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="3.96">and then ironically it took like a week</text>

  <text start="132.51" dur="4.36">they</text>
  <text start="132.74" dur="8.25">were so swamped so that is the power of</text>
  <text start="136.87" dur="7.57">mass togetherness you know mass working</text>

  <text start="144.44" dur="7.95">leave a platform you Facebook&amp;#39;s user</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="5.34">time is down like a half or a quarter or</text>
  <text start="152.39" dur="5.67">something something ridiculous Twitter</text>
  <text start="155.24" dur="4.32">has been facing a huge backlash as well</text>
  <text start="158.06" dur="1.95">I mean Jack Dorsey is probably going to</text>

  <text start="160.01" dur="5.76">according to Q so we&amp;#39;re definitely in a</text>
  <text start="164.39" dur="4.38">war here folks we&amp;#39;re in a war between</text>
  <text start="165.77" dur="6.57">bad ideas and a lot of censorship power</text>
  <text start="168.77" dur="5.88">and good ideas with very little reach so</text>
  <text start="172.34" dur="4.17">that is where you come in that is why we</text>
  <text start="174.65" dur="4.14">need your help we need you to share the</text>
  <text start="176.51" dur="3.81">videos that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="199.19" dur="3.81">with all the other youtubers if they are</text>
  <text start="200.45" dur="4.89">putting hours and hours of research time</text>
  <text start="203" dur="4.71">into something everyday to make a short</text>
  <text start="205.34" dur="4.8">video it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not just like a ten</text>
  <text start="207.71" dur="5.4">minute video is a Tim and a day job it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="210.14" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s a hours and hours of content and</text>
  <text start="213.11" dur="5.64">research that goes into that small</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="5.88">amount of content so I&amp;#39;m just babbling</text>
  <text start="218.75" dur="4.2">on here but basically please support</text>
  <text start="221.3" dur="3.18">your favorite youtubers please support</text>
  <text start="222.95" dur="5.31">the people that are getting the word out</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="5.19">about queueing on and please spread the</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="2.85">news that they&amp;#39;re censoring and</text>
  <text start="229.67" dur="4.59">everything else because this is how we</text>
  <text start="231.11" dur="5.88">beat them you know it&amp;#39;s a marathon not a</text>
  <text start="234.26" dur="4.71">sprint so it&amp;#39;s not do it today and then</text>
  <text start="236.99" dur="5.49">stop it&amp;#39;s do it every day until we win</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="5.58">and just walk toward the fire you know</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="3.33">as Breitbart said because when you do</text>
  <text start="244.55" dur="4.05">that you give other people the courage</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="4.62">to do it as well every time there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="4.07">new youtuber they spawn two more</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="5.7">youtubers that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how it works</text>
  <text start="252.67" dur="5.16">because someone likes their style and is</text>
  <text start="256.13" dur="4.44">encouraged by the fact that they did it</text>
  <text start="257.83" dur="4.75">you know I&amp;#39;m not the most articulate I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="260.57" dur="3.599">not the best I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m the best</text>
  <text start="262.58" dur="3.21">youtuber at all I think I&amp;#39;m probably the</text>
  <text start="264.169" dur="2.28">small guy and that in the queue and on</text>
  <text start="265.79" dur="3.54">space</text>
  <text start="266.449" dur="5.331">among the older crowd I know that</text>
  <text start="269.33" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s some newer people in it now but</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="4.84">you know peeps some people like my style</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="4.759">and then some people think well if that</text>
  <text start="276.62" dur="6.15">guy can do it anyone can do it right so</text>
  <text start="279.159" dur="5.47">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how you know I try to I</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="3.989">try to focus on the macro and the the</text>
  <text start="284.629" dur="4.861">big-picture some other people go in to</text>
  <text start="286.759" dur="6.481">exact exquisite detail which I love to</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="5.16">watch those videos as well but you know</text>
  <text start="293.24" dur="4.59">the goal here is to try to condense</text>
  <text start="294.65" dur="4.59">everything down for an audience that may</text>
  <text start="297.83" dur="4.2">not have enough time to deal with it you</text>
  <text start="299.24" dur="5.76">know people have busy lives so my goal</text>
  <text start="302.03" dur="4.289">is to try to make things as accessible</text>
  <text start="305" dur="3.87">and you can kind of get the big picture</text>
  <text start="306.319" dur="4.521">quickly and then I include the links</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="4.829">that you can go do your own research</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="5.71">worth mentioning the a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="313.699" dur="4.171">still using queuing on posts comm even</text>
  <text start="316.55" dur="3.959">some of the youtubers are still sharing</text>
  <text start="317.87" dur="4.32">queuing on post comm and that is a</text>
  <text start="320.509" dur="3.301">problem because that website was</text>
  <text start="322.19" dur="3.09">compromised I mean if you go there</text>
  <text start="323.81" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re likely get if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="3.539">have a pop-up blocker you&amp;#39;re likely</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="2.699">getting these pop-ups that are full of</text>
  <text start="328.819" dur="3.061">porn or something</text>
  <text start="330.199" dur="3.84">many people keep commenting and saying</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="4.43">that I haven&amp;#39;t experienced it myself I</text>
  <text start="334.039" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t use that one anymore but</text>
  <text start="336.31" dur="4.75">you know if you check my queue and on</text>
  <text start="338.449" dur="4.351">videos I&amp;#39;m starting to include my link</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="4.829">below where you can go to the new queue</text>
  <text start="342.8" dur="5.33">posts you can still probably see them on</text>
  <text start="345.889" dur="4.89">Cuban on post but it&amp;#39;s it seems to be</text>
  <text start="348.13" dur="4.18">compromised and that means malicious</text>
  <text start="350.779" dur="2.911">actors that means they could be trying</text>
  <text start="352.31" dur="5.19">to put viruses on you or something</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="6.12">so a couple good free suggestions for</text>
