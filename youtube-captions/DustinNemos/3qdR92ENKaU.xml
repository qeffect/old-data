  <text start="1.28" dur="4.63">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.689" dur="5.251">Mouse of Destiny most calm and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="5.91" dur="5.16">joined today by David Stefan a kind of a</text>
  <text start="8.94" dur="3.93">champion of freedom up in Canada he is</text>
  <text start="11.07" dur="4.529">he&amp;#39;s been involved in his own situation</text>
  <text start="12.87" dur="5.34">but lately he&amp;#39;s been kind of drumming up</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="4.291">support for a couple in need they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="18.21" dur="4.02">being bullied by the government trying</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="4.889">to push you know new precedents in the</text>
  <text start="22.23" dur="3.389">vaccine world new oppressions and the</text>
  <text start="24.779" dur="3.061">medical tyranny</text>
  <text start="25.619" dur="4.111">so David I&amp;#39;m gonna let you kind of run</text>
  <text start="27.84" dur="4.469">with it and explain kind of what is</text>
  <text start="29.73" dur="4.52">going on why you know in America why</text>
  <text start="32.309" dur="4.261">should we care if this is in Canada like</text>
  <text start="34.25" dur="3.82">obviously what happens there is very</text>
  <text start="36.57" dur="5.04">similar to what can happen here people</text>
  <text start="38.07" dur="5.09">should be concerned worldwide so go</text>
  <text start="41.61" dur="3.719">ahead and explain it for us brother</text>
  <text start="43.16" dur="3.579">absolutely and you you cover the basis</text>
  <text start="45.329" dur="3.091">very well there as to why people should</text>
  <text start="46.739" dur="3.361">be concerned in the US I mean</text>
  <text start="48.42" dur="4.26">historically if we take a look at it you</text>
  <text start="50.1" dur="4.92">see the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 in</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="5.519">the u.s. well in 1931 see the the Bank</text>
  <text start="55.02" dur="5.91">Act of Canada you know doing the same</text>
  <text start="58.199" dur="5.221">type of things you see always a parallel</text>
  <text start="60.93" dur="4.379">Canada is always in step with the US or</text>
  <text start="63.42" dur="4.65">the u.s. is in step with Canada it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="65.309" dur="5.281">really this border is almost fictitious</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="4.56">in a sense in a sense so there are many</text>
  <text start="70.59" dur="4.86">there&amp;#39;s an overarching theme or agenda</text>
  <text start="72.63" dur="4.2">behind it all exactly so if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="3.419">something taking place here that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="3.42">to create a state of tyranny you want a</text>
  <text start="78.869" dur="3">bet that it&amp;#39;s gonna be taking place in</text>
  <text start="80.25" dur="3.18">the US as well if it was successful here</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="3.901">likely to be successful in the US as</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="4.399">well and so what we&amp;#39;re seeing is some</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="4.38">interesting proceedings taking place</text>
  <text start="87.829" dur="5.08">really out of the epicenter of Calgary</text>
  <text start="90.15" dur="5.19">Alberta is where the agenda is beginning</text>
  <text start="92.909" dur="4.741">and we&amp;#39;re gonna probably watch a spill</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="4.26">over into the other provinces and what</text>
  <text start="97.65" dur="4.14">not as it as it creates a precedent in</text>
  <text start="99.6" dur="3.69">law through these criminal proceedings</text>
  <text start="101.79" dur="3.56">that are taking place and it started off</text>
  <text start="103.29" dur="4.649">with my case me and my wife&amp;#39;s case</text>
  <text start="105.35" dur="6.1">starting back in 2012 after the passing</text>
  <text start="107.939" dur="5.311">of our son and now we&amp;#39;re seeing we just</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="4.68">saw the second case of its kind in</text>
  <text start="113.25" dur="5.61">Canada take place coming out of Calgary</text>
  <text start="116.13" dur="5.04">again same doctors involved same</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="4.59">hospital it appears that it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="4.5">coming out of out of the University of</text>
  <text start="123.45" dur="6.21">Calgary and over to tolds Hospital and</text>
  <text start="125.67" dur="7.08">what that is is they are attempting to</text>
  <text start="129.66" dur="4.23">broaden the scope of the application of</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="2.4">the charges of</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="2.82">failing to provide the necessaries of</text>
  <text start="135.15" dur="4.26">life which is up to five years in jail</text>
  <text start="136.71" dur="4.85">as well as criminal negligence resulting</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="5.88">in death which is up to 25 years in jail</text>
  <text start="141.56" dur="5.74">- not just negligent uncaring cruel</text>
  <text start="145.29" dur="4.05">parents but actually loving attentive</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="5.73">caring parents and that&amp;#39;s being made</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="5.85">clear in both cases that the parents</text>
  <text start="153.03" dur="3.24">were loving myself you know obviously be</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="3.33">the first there were the judge actually</text>
  <text start="156.27" dur="5.49">said at one point this peculiar case</text>
  <text start="158.52" dur="4.469">because all the evidence that&amp;#39;s before</text>
  <text start="161.76" dur="3.62">the courts and before the jury at this</text>
  <text start="162.989" dur="4.771">point is that the the Stephan&amp;#39;s are</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="4.15">loving caring and attentive so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="3.449">really interesting that this is you know</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="3.209">taking place so he was really kind of</text>
  <text start="171.209" dur="4.411">dumbfounded by what was happening</text>
  <text start="172.739" dur="4.831">because it was actually the first case</text>
  <text start="175.62" dur="5.07">of its kind in Canada to ever have those</text>
  <text start="177.57" dur="5.13">charges applied to loving and caring</text>
  <text start="180.69" dur="6.269">parents so the message that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="182.7" dur="6.27">trying to send it sucked really to</text>
  <text start="186.959" dur="4.411">ensure medical system compliance that if</text>
  <text start="188.97" dur="6">you fall outside of the realm of</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="5.67">allopathic treatments and and not</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="3.81">through not to neglect or or anything</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="4.169">that but if that&amp;#39;s what you kind of you</text>
  <text start="198.78" dur="6.33">favored you&amp;#39;ll see naturopathy or</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="5.071">homeopathy or chiropractic and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="3.24">your first line of treatment and</text>
  <text start="206.28" dur="4.679">something happens that wrong with your</text>
  <text start="208.35" dur="3.6">child the message that the transcend is</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="2.941">you&amp;#39;re gonna be held criminally liable</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="4.349">because you didn&amp;#39;t take your child into</text>
  <text start="213.9" dur="5.52">the doctor even though what were seems</text>
  <text start="216.299" dur="4.681">to statistically is that that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="3.87">more likely to end up with a</text>
  <text start="220.98" dur="5.069">complication or death if you were to</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="5.13">take your child into the hospital based</text>
  <text start="226.049" dur="4.801">on the statistics where it&amp;#39;s now the</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="4.409">third leading cause of death and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.85" dur="3.63">largely underreported and that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="232.829" dur="2.821">medical misadventure and then the proper</text>
  <text start="234.48" dur="2.28">application of medications as well</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s over a hundred thousand people</text>
  <text start="236.76" dur="6.78">dying every year within Canada and the</text>
  <text start="239.94" dur="5.46">u.s. from properly prescribed</text>
  <text start="243.54" dur="4.35">medications and there&amp;#39;s over 300,000</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="4.08">dying from the medical adventure so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.89" dur="3.96">really peculiar because if your child</text>
  <text start="249.48" dur="4.89">dies in the medical system or from the</text>
  <text start="251.85" dur="5.52">medical system you likely won&amp;#39;t be held</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="5.04">criminally liable unless you had chosen</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="3.51">natural treatments first and foremost</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="3.78">and they can use that against you to</text>
  <text start="260.88" dur="4.409">push for the agenda and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="3.9">becoming abundantly clear here with</text>
  <text start="265.289" dur="3.541">these two cases</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="4.23">so really they&amp;#39;re trying to the reason</text>
  <text start="268.83" dur="3.839">why people should be concerned is what</text>
  <text start="271.32" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re holding parents</text>
  <text start="272.669" dur="5.671">to a much higher standard of care than a</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="4.709">medical professional so if you screw up</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="4.23">as a parent you&amp;#39;re in trouble if the</text>
  <text start="280.889" dur="4.441">medical professional screws up and kills</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="4.14">your child you won&amp;#39;t see any issues you</text>
  <text start="285.33" dur="3.149">won&amp;#39;t see any court proceedings over</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="3.15">that and so it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="288.479" dur="3.75">peculiar what&amp;#39;s taking place but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="5.13">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the two cases that I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="292.229" dur="4.081">about my case and in the case of Jeremy</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="4.71">and Jennifer Clark and the passing of</text>
  <text start="296.31" dur="5.19">Little John Wyatt Clark are perhaps the</text>
  <text start="299.7" dur="3.66">the most precedent-setting cases in the</text>
  <text start="301.5" dur="4.2">history of Canada for ensuring medical</text>
  <text start="303.36" dur="4.5">system compliance or establishing</text>
  <text start="305.7" dur="4.35">medical tyranny as many of your your</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="9.05">viewers will will be more akin to that</text>
  <text start="310.05" dur="9.54">terminology yeah I mean they are clearly</text>
  <text start="316.91" dur="4.89">obviously seeking out trying to find</text>
  <text start="319.59" dur="4.5">these rare instances in which case</text>
  <text start="321.8" dur="3.7">holistically minded parents actually end</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="4.56">up with sick kids because that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="6.419">hard to come by anyway and then they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="5.07">trying to bash that which has a huge not</text>
  <text start="331.919" dur="3.81">only is there that I don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="4.62">your country but here&amp;#39;s the the big</text>
  <text start="335.729" dur="4.461">pharma FDA revolving door you know the</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="4.92">same people keep working in both</text>
  <text start="340.19" dur="4.78">industries so they&amp;#39;re rubber stamping</text>
  <text start="343.26" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re their friends that they go eat</text>
  <text start="344.97" dur="4.62">lunch with later and obviously there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="3.27">money incentive behind trying to push</text>
  <text start="349.59" dur="3.81">that onto list to people and to demonize</text>
  <text start="351.33" dur="3.959">those things to begin with you know I I</text>
  <text start="353.4" dur="4.889">talk a lot about those on my show just</text>
  <text start="355.289" dur="4.951">holistic kind of DIY things that you can</text>
  <text start="358.289" dur="5.041">do for yourself to not have to go to a</text>
  <text start="360.24" dur="6.33">doctor in the first place but tell us</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="5.04">more about this other couples case and</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="6.15">where it&amp;#39;s going and you know are they</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="5.79">are they being successful absolutely so</text>
  <text start="372.72" dur="4.71">in regard to being successful Ralph&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.16" dur="5.79">about know that the parents aren&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="377.43" dur="4.799">agenda is is is being successful in</text>
  <text start="379.95" dur="6.27">being rammed through and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="382.229" dur="5.431">peculiar so what happened is I&amp;#39;ll kind</text>
  <text start="386.22" dur="3.33">of start from beginning go to go at</text>
  <text start="387.66" dur="6.509">the end as quickly as possible here and</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="5.04">so in November of 2013 towards the end</text>
  <text start="394.169" dur="2.43">of it</text>
  <text start="394.59" dur="3.42">Little John Wyatt Clark is 14 months old</text>
  <text start="396.599" dur="3.901">he&amp;#39;s breastfeeding he&amp;#39;s eating some</text>
  <text start="398.01" dur="4.35">solids his parents are vegan</text>
  <text start="400.5" dur="5.66">they are home schoolers they&amp;#39;ve got two</text>
  <text start="402.36" dur="6.51">other children they are in the organic</text>
  <text start="406.16" dur="4.72">produce food that had the thing and</text>
  <text start="408.87" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re the really health-conscious</text>
  <text start="410.88" dur="5.01">parents and so and then and then to boot</text>
  <text start="414.39" dur="3.51">as well you&amp;#39;ll see if you look at any of</text>
  <text start="415.89" dur="3.3">the media that&amp;#39;s out there they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="417.9" dur="4.5">bashed on for being developed all the</text>
  <text start="419.19" dur="7.5">words of Christ adhering to a particular</text>
  <text start="422.4" dur="8.55">religion and and and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="6.06">vaccinate obviously and so he becomes</text>
  <text start="430.95" dur="4.86">sick Little John White Clark and he had</text>
  <text start="432.75" dur="5.13">been experiencing chronic eczema off and</text>
  <text start="435.81" dur="5.22">on throughout his life and every time</text>
  <text start="437.88" dur="6.33">that he began to teeth he it would begin</text>
  <text start="441.03" dur="4.5">to flare up the exam would and so that</text>
  <text start="444.21" dur="4.1">that was really the only chronic</text>
  <text start="445.53" dur="5.97">condition that he appeared to have now</text>
  <text start="448.31" dur="5.95">towards the end of November of 2013 he</text>
  <text start="451.5" dur="4.95">starts to get a little sick where he is</text>
  <text start="454.26" dur="4.17">losing interest in eating so he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="456.45" dur="4.23">breastfeeding as much so the parents</text>
  <text start="458.43" dur="4.5">begin to supplement that with with the</text>
  <text start="460.68" dur="5.489">coconut water to make sure that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="462.93" dur="6.93">getting properly hydrated and about a</text>
  <text start="466.169" dur="5.611">day or two after this had begun they</text>
  <text start="469.86" dur="3.45">recognized that there there seems to be</text>
  <text start="471.78" dur="3.3">a little bit of blackening on one of the</text>
  <text start="473.31" dur="2.82">toes it appears and and it&amp;#39;s apparent</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="3.6">from one of the google searches that</text>
  <text start="476.13" dur="4.98">they made on November 27th at 6:21 p.m.</text>
  <text start="478.68" dur="4.14">and the reason why that came up in court</text>
  <text start="481.11" dur="4.44">is there was actually a police raid on</text>
  <text start="482.82" dur="5.67">their house and they had a threat</text>
  <text start="485.55" dur="4.95">digital forensic professional go in and</text>
  <text start="488.49" dur="3.51">pull off all the google searches and</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="3.81">everything so this is the type of</text>
  <text start="492" dur="3.63">something you can expect after they</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="3.63">don&amp;#39;t have enough evidence to convict</text>
  <text start="495.63" dur="3.99">you but they want to proceed with the</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="3">agenda that they&amp;#39;re going to to make</text>
  <text start="499.62" dur="3.48">sure that they find all the evidence</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="5.25">that they can to twist in their favor so</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="7.95">on November 27th at 6:21 p.m. they find</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="6.45">a Google search for gangrene on a toe or</text>
  <text start="511.05" dur="5.7">something something to that effect right</text>
  <text start="512.64" dur="6.51">and so whether or not the parents knew</text>
  <text start="516.75" dur="5.159">it was gangrene or not is a whole nother</text>
  <text start="519.15" dur="4.38">story I mean it I&amp;#39;m not even sure what</text>
  <text start="521.909" dur="3.691">the the medical definition of gangrene</text>
  <text start="523.53" dur="4.23">is but what came out is that there was</text>
  <text start="525.6" dur="4.35">necrosis of the toe so there seemed to</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="5.73">be something that was dying but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.95" dur="4.06">interesting because it may have been as</text>
  <text start="533.49" dur="2.83">small</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="4.5">you know even a little blood blister or</text>
  <text start="536.32" dur="4.86">something to that effect because the</text>
  <text start="538.51" dur="5.67">next day what happens is he starts to go</text>
  <text start="541.18" dur="4.65">cold and clammy and the mom gives him a</text>
  <text start="544.18" dur="4.05">bath and recognized by the end of the</text>
  <text start="545.83" dur="4.71">path that this necrosis is begin to</text>
  <text start="548.23" dur="6.87">spread and so now it&amp;#39;s black edging is</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="6.21">the way it was initially termed when he</text>
  <text start="555.1" dur="3.03">arrived at the hospital when they saw</text>
  <text start="556.75" dur="2.67">that there was an issue here and that it</text>
  <text start="558.13" dur="3.96">was being spread they did they rushed</text>

  <text start="562.09" dur="3.96">initial presentation to the hospital</text>
  <text start="563.44" dur="4.23">they saw black edging on two of the toes</text>
  <text start="566.05" dur="3.48">on his left foot and one of the toes on</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="4.62">his right foot so it was something that</text>
  <text start="569.53" dur="4.62">was happening on both sides of the the</text>
  <text start="572.29" dur="6.45">body which was interesting so it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="574.15" dur="6.72">an isolated type issue now that cold and</text>
  <text start="578.74" dur="3.27">clammy knows what what they found would</text>
  <text start="580.87" dur="3.15">he get to the hospital he took a</text>
  <text start="582.01" dur="5.16">temperature and he was hypothermic he</text>
  <text start="584.02" dur="5.42">was sitting at 30 degrees Celsius which</text>
  <text start="587.17" dur="4.38">is about 6 and a half degrees Celsius</text>
  <text start="589.44" dur="5.56">below what you should be if you were to</text>
  <text start="591.55" dur="6.81">run the the rough math it would be about</text>
  <text start="595" dur="6.51">10 degrees Fahrenheit or just over to</text>
  <text start="598.36" dur="5.85">cold and so below what normal but so</text>
  <text start="601.51" dur="4.74">full they identified that he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="604.21" dur="4.62">hypothermia and they identify that</text>
  <text start="606.25" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s a circulatory issue which likely</text>
  <text start="608.83" dur="3.84">would be creating that necrosis of the</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="4.65">toes they concede him in his foot and so</text>
  <text start="612.67" dur="4.49">the first nurse identifies that and the</text>
  <text start="615.13" dur="4.95">first doctor that that tends to him</text>
  <text start="617.16" dur="4.18">checks for a hair turning key to see if</text>
  <text start="620.08" dur="2.88">a hair had wrapped around and was</text>
  <text start="621.34" dur="5.07">cutting off the circulation didn&amp;#39;t find</text>
  <text start="622.96" dur="5.22">anything and so what they did notice or</text>
  <text start="626.41" dur="5.16">what they did note though is that he was</text>
  <text start="628.18" dur="5.7">alert attentive and neurologically he</text>
  <text start="631.57" dur="4.56">was he was all there upon arrival so</text>
  <text start="633.88" dur="5.61">he&amp;#39;s stable he&amp;#39;s just he&amp;#39;s going cold</text>
  <text start="636.13" dur="5.55">and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s got this this necrotic</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="6.3">issue of the toes starting to happen</text>
  <text start="641.68" dur="6">from poor circulation so he&amp;#39;s taken from</text>
  <text start="645.79" dur="4.32">the foothills Hospital in Calgary</text>
  <text start="647.68" dur="5.01">Alberta which is more of an adult</text>
  <text start="650.11" dur="4.41">hospital and he&amp;#39;s taken by ambulance</text>
  <text start="652.69" dur="4.23">over to the over to Children&amp;#39;s Hospital</text>
  <text start="654.52" dur="3.81">after they couldn&amp;#39;t care for him</text>
  <text start="656.92" dur="4.14">appropriately at the foothills hospital</text>
  <text start="658.33" dur="8.37">he gets into the trauma Bay at 3:51 p.m.</text>
  <text start="661.06" dur="7.65">on November 28th and upon initial</text>
  <text start="666.7" dur="5.16">the nurse one of the nurses does a</text>
  <text start="668.71" dur="4.95">Glasgow Coma Scale rating on a and finds</text>
  <text start="671.86" dur="3.06">that he scores 15 or 15 on it so</text>
  <text start="673.66" dur="3.03">neurologically he&amp;#39;s all there</text>
  <text start="674.92" dur="4.86">everything&amp;#39;s fine and stable</text>
  <text start="676.69" dur="6.63">he&amp;#39;s treatable and so what they do is</text>
  <text start="679.78" dur="5.52">they drill into his his bone and place</text>
  <text start="683.32" dur="3.93">an interosseous lime so they can start</text>
  <text start="685.3" dur="3.96">pumping fluids and what they did at 4</text>
  <text start="687.25" dur="5.28">o&amp;#39;clock so after 9 minutes of being</text>
  <text start="689.26" dur="5.13">there they took a blood sample and they</text>
  <text start="692.53" dur="3.63">went and had it cultured to see if</text>
  <text start="694.39" dur="3.36">there&amp;#39;s any infectious agents if it was</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="3.54">an infection that was causing any of</text>
  <text start="697.75" dur="3.27">this which he didn&amp;#39;t have the telltale</text>
  <text start="699.7" dur="4.29">signs of you know there wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="701.02" dur="4.98">inflammatory responses anything to that</text>
  <text start="703.99" dur="4.02">effect but you know they take that as a</text>
  <text start="706" dur="3.78">precautionary measure and then also</text>
  <text start="708.01" dur="3.42">taking a look at what his nutrient</text>
  <text start="709.78" dur="3.71">levels worse they did a number of tests</text>
  <text start="711.43" dur="4.35">with up that initial sample of blood</text>
  <text start="713.49" dur="4.51">what they did determine through a blood</text>
  <text start="715.78" dur="4.53">gas rate reading was that he was</text>
  <text start="718" dur="4.17">hyponatremic which means that he was at</text>
  <text start="720.31" dur="3.96">a hundred eight millimoles per liter of</text>
  <text start="722.17" dur="5.88">sodium in his blood which is low because</text>
  <text start="724.27" dur="5.19">the normal is about 135 145 now what</text>
  <text start="728.05" dur="3.45">that&amp;#39;ll do is it&amp;#39;ll actually have a</text>
  <text start="729.46" dur="4.61">negative impact on the brain and it can</text>
  <text start="731.5" dur="6.63">cause symptoms like hypothermia and</text>
  <text start="734.07" dur="5.74">lethargy kind of listless you know not</text>
  <text start="738.13" dur="2.82">you know having interest which is what</text>
  <text start="739.81" dur="3.21">he was starting to see a couple days</text>
  <text start="740.95" dur="4.5">previous where he no longer wasn&amp;#39;t one</text>
  <text start="743.02" dur="5.04">to eat as much that type of stuff and so</text>
  <text start="745.45" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s got hyponatremia and they need to</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="5.19">correct that now the thing is with</text>
  <text start="750.16" dur="5.58">hyponatremia is you have to correct it</text>
  <text start="753.25" dur="4.17">at an appropriate rate it&amp;#39;s very safe</text>
  <text start="755.74" dur="3.36">rate because they found that if you if</text>
  <text start="757.42" dur="4.83">you overdo it you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll create major</text>
  <text start="759.1" dur="5.94">brain damage or kill people and so the</text>
  <text start="762.25" dur="4.86">safe rate for chronic hyponatremia that</text>
  <text start="765.04" dur="5.07">the brain has had the ability to adjust</text>
  <text start="767.11" dur="5.61">to over the pair of a few days this safe</text>
  <text start="770.11" dur="6.57">rate to adjust it at is increasing the</text>
  <text start="772.72" dur="6.75">sodium by 0.5 millimoles per liter per</text>
  <text start="776.68" dur="6.6">hour so you&amp;#39;ve got to go really slow so</text>
  <text start="779.47" dur="6.36">here he is you know he&amp;#39;s almost 30 he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="783.28" dur="4.41">about 30 millimoles per liter low but</text>
  <text start="785.83" dur="3.24">you can&amp;#39;t increase you know you can also</text>
  <text start="787.69" dur="4.26">get back to a normal level otherwise</text>
  <text start="789.07" dur="4.5">what will happen is there&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="791.95" dur="4.5">concentration difference in the</text>
  <text start="793.57" dur="4.89">extracellular fluid of sodium versus the</text>
  <text start="796.45" dur="2.95">intracellular fluid and what will happen</text>
  <text start="798.46" dur="5.98">is you&amp;#39;ll have a</text>
  <text start="799.4" dur="7.44">massive dreaming or transfer of</text>
  <text start="804.44" dur="4.11">intracellular fluid within the cells out</text>
  <text start="806.84" dur="3">to the extracellular fluid to try to</text>
  <text start="808.55" dur="3">compensate for the concentration</text>
  <text start="809.84" dur="4.41">difference and you end up with this</text>
  <text start="811.55" dur="6.09">rapid shrinkage of the cells and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="814.25" dur="6.03">you&amp;#39;ll create cell die-off and in regard</text>
  <text start="817.64" dur="5.31">to neurons you&amp;#39;ll actually create or</text>
  <text start="820.28" dur="4.95">you&amp;#39;ll demon myelinate the myelin sheath</text>
  <text start="822.95" dur="4.17">and you&amp;#39;ll actually create axonal</text>
  <text start="825.23" dur="3.33">severing of that nerve cell it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="827.12" dur="3.09">little you know the axon the previs</text>
  <text start="828.56" dur="3.33">coming awful actually sever ratham so</text>
  <text start="830.21" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;re actually destroying these cells</text>
  <text start="831.89" dur="4.32">and that&amp;#39;s not a good thing especially</text>
  <text start="834.62" dur="3.78">when we&amp;#39;re talking about the brain and</text>
  <text start="836.21" dur="4.68">so it causes a condition called osmotic</text>
  <text start="838.4" dur="5.31">demyelination syndrome which generally</text>
  <text start="840.89" dur="5.85">you&amp;#39;ll die from so what they do is at</text>
  <text start="843.71" dur="4.5">4:05 p.m. they begin that what they</text>
  <text start="846.74" dur="3.84">called an aggressive saline</text>
  <text start="848.21" dur="5.31">resuscitation and they pumped 200</text>
  <text start="850.58" dur="6.47">milliliters of saline fluid into him and</text>
  <text start="853.52" dur="5.85">then a 4:07 p.m. the attending doctor</text>
  <text start="857.05" dur="6.04">goes and gives him another bolus of</text>
  <text start="859.37" dur="5.52">saline fluid 400 milliliters and doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="863.09" dur="3.39">chart it which is interesting but she</text>
  <text start="864.89" dur="3.57">puts it in her own personal notes and</text>
  <text start="866.48" dur="3.36">this came out during the court case so</text>
  <text start="868.46" dur="3.33">even when they pulled the medical files</text>
  <text start="869.84" dur="3.36">they didn&amp;#39;t have that on board or they</text>
  <text start="871.79" dur="3.6">didn&amp;#39;t have that information available</text>
  <text start="873.2" dur="3.96">to them until she admitted to it in</text>
  <text start="875.39" dur="4.7">court that she&amp;#39;d given him another 400</text>
  <text start="877.16" dur="5.16">milliliters now just a side note here</text>
  <text start="880.09" dur="4.09">these were looking at causation of death</text>
  <text start="882.32" dur="5.34">as to what actually caused Littlejohn</text>
  <text start="884.18" dur="6.57">Wyatt Clark&amp;#39;s death there&amp;#39;s two two</text>
  <text start="887.66" dur="4.29">aspects one an over-aggressive sailing</text>
  <text start="890.75" dur="3.87">resuscitation that would create the</text>
  <text start="891.95" dur="4.83">osmotic demyelination syndrome and two</text>
  <text start="894.62" dur="4.83">the sheer amount of fluids at the gamin</text>
  <text start="896.78" dur="4.68">a young child of his size he&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="899.45" dur="7.29">nine kilograms would have about 700</text>
  <text start="901.46" dur="6.93">milliliters of blood and so what they</text>
  <text start="906.74" dur="3.87">did in two men and says they just put</text>
  <text start="908.39" dur="4.26">600 milliliters of additional fluid in</text>
  <text start="910.61" dur="5.4">their diluting the blood substantively</text>
  <text start="912.65" dur="5.28">and then they they continued on and so</text>
  <text start="916.01" dur="3.75">within 32 minutes what they did is he</text>
  <text start="917.93" dur="4.41">actually more than doubled the amount of</text>
  <text start="919.76" dur="4.23">fluids in his body which would have</text>
  <text start="922.34" dur="3.9">created the hypoxic</text>
  <text start="923.99" dur="4.08">injury itself because you wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="926.24" dur="3.63">delivering nearly enough oxygen to all</text>
  <text start="928.07" dur="3.89">the various areas of the body so you</text>
  <text start="929.87" dur="3.52">could end up with major organs shut down</text>
  <text start="931.96" dur="3.65">awesome</text>
  <text start="933.39" dur="4.23">to the brain etc so that alone would</text>
  <text start="935.61" dur="3.45">have killed any normal person but</text>
  <text start="937.62" dur="2.91">further to that when we take a look at</text>
  <text start="939.06" dur="5.13">this that what would replace with the</text>
  <text start="940.53" dur="5.16">saline resuscitation at 4:17 so 12</text>
  <text start="944.19" dur="3.9">minutes after the beginning began with</text>
  <text start="945.69" dur="4.2">saline resuscitation what they got is a</text>
  <text start="948.09" dur="3.87">blood gas reading that showed that it</text>
  <text start="949.89" dur="4.11">just taken his blood or is sorting</text>
  <text start="951.96" dur="4.71">levels from 108 millimoles per liter in</text>
  <text start="954" dur="5.28">the blood to 115 so they just increased</text>
  <text start="956.67" dur="4.53">by 7 millimoles per liter within 12</text>
  <text start="959.28" dur="5.34">minutes and remember the safe limit is</text>
  <text start="961.2" dur="5.25">0.5 millimoles per liter per hour so if</text>
  <text start="964.62" dur="4.17">you do the simple math on it it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="966.45" dur="4.83">70 times to fast</text>
  <text start="968.79" dur="4.2">above and beyond what the safe protocols</text>
  <text start="971.28" dur="3.84">are so that we&amp;#39;re talking completely</text>
  <text start="972.99" dur="3.45">reckless and so rather than taking a</text>
  <text start="975.12" dur="3.03">look at that and saying holy holy crap</text>
  <text start="976.44" dur="3.72">like we just created a situation here</text>
  <text start="978.15" dur="4.74">that he&amp;#39;ll likely die from what do they</text>
  <text start="980.16" dur="4.59">do have 4:18 they give him another bolus</text>
  <text start="982.89" dur="3.48">as sodium bicarbonate which would have</text>
  <text start="984.75" dur="4.11">further elevated sodium levels in the</text>
  <text start="986.37" dur="4.11">blood at 4:20 he goes into a seizure so</text>
  <text start="988.86" dur="3.9">15 minutes before he&amp;#39;s stable he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="990.48" dur="4.98">cognitively well yeah he&amp;#39;s treatable</text>
  <text start="992.76" dur="6.03">he&amp;#39;s responding to pain he&amp;#39;s interacting</text>
  <text start="995.46" dur="4.35">with his his environment and suddenly 15</text>
  <text start="998.79" dur="2.94">minutes later for the began his</text>
  <text start="999.81" dur="3.33">treatment seizure and he declines</text>
  <text start="1001.73" dur="3.3">rapidly all his vitals to stabilize</text>
  <text start="1003.14" dur="5.09">because that&amp;#39;s a major negative impact</text>
  <text start="1005.03" dur="5.94">in the pons area of the brainstem which</text>
  <text start="1008.23" dur="5.11">would obviously facilitate the flow of</text>
  <text start="1010.97" dur="4.02">all information from the brain down into</text>
  <text start="1013.34" dur="4.32">the body because the brainstem is kind</text>
  <text start="1014.99" dur="4.29">of the the transport words it&amp;#39;s at the</text>
  <text start="1017.66" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s well it&amp;#39;s the brainstem right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1019.28" dur="3.42">the bring that can or it&amp;#39;s apart like</text>
  <text start="1020.81" dur="3.779">thanks to brain to every other part of</text>
  <text start="1022.7" dur="3.48">the body right and so all information</text>
  <text start="1024.589" dur="3.391">has to flow through there so they do see</text>
  <text start="1026.18" dur="3.899">the substance substantive damage to the</text>
  <text start="1027.98" dur="4.62">pons area which would also negative</text>
  <text start="1030.079" dur="4.62">impact the regulation of all the vital</text>
  <text start="1032.6" dur="5.13">so now his blood pressure is all off his</text>
  <text start="1034.699" dur="5.941">heart rates off his breathing rates off</text>
  <text start="1037.73" dur="4.109">everything these stabilizes then about 2</text>
  <text start="1040.64" dur="5.88">hours later he goes into a cardiac</text>
  <text start="1041.839" dur="7.201">arrest and has another seizure at this</text>
  <text start="1046.52" dur="5.01">point they had continued to increase the</text>
  <text start="1049.04" dur="6.51">level of fluids and the level of saline</text>
  <text start="1051.53" dur="5.55">back to shortly after he gave and not or</text>
  <text start="1055.55" dur="4.41">strongly after the seizure they gave him</text>
  <text start="1057.08" dur="5.67">a concentrated Bullis of sodium at that</text>
  <text start="1059.96" dur="5.13">point to further increase those levels</text>
  <text start="1062.75" dur="4.35">and so within one hour they&amp;#39;d increased</text>
  <text start="1065.09" dur="6.209">his his sodium levels by</text>
  <text start="1067.1" dur="7.199">17 millimoles per liter which is you</text>
  <text start="1071.299" dur="5.521">know as much as you could possibly do at</text>
  <text start="1074.299" dur="5.581">a safe rate within two dates they had</text>
  <text start="1076.82" dur="4.92">done in 57 minutes so of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1079.88" dur="6.11">gonna have these issues so subsequently</text>
  <text start="1081.74" dur="6.929">within 21 hours he dies he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1085.99" dur="5.14">restabilized from that point forward</text>
  <text start="1088.669" dur="4.951">so within 15 minutes of arriving at the</text>
  <text start="1091.13" dur="5.45">hospital and getting treatment he has a</text>
  <text start="1093.62" dur="8.4">rapid decline and subsequently dies and</text>
  <text start="1096.58" dur="6.94">the parents end up leaving in police</text>
  <text start="1102.02" dur="4.649">custody and the other two children die</text>
  <text start="1103.52" dur="6">believing in Child Protective Service</text>
  <text start="1106.669" dur="4.111">custody and then the you know they</text>
  <text start="1109.52" dur="4.62">didn&amp;#39;t really have enough evidence for</text>
  <text start="1110.78" dur="5.22">to substantiate an arrest or anything</text>
  <text start="1114.14" dur="3.419">like that so what do they do they do a</text>
  <text start="1116" dur="4.77">police raid on the house and what they</text>
  <text start="1117.559" dur="5.311">find goes against goes completely</text>
  <text start="1120.77" dur="4.5">against what the listed causation of</text>
  <text start="1122.87" dur="5.76">death was as I came out over nine months</text>
  <text start="1125.27" dur="4.44">after the passing bill John Wyatt Clarke</text>

  <text start="1129.71" dur="3.209">although saying that he died from an</text>
  <text start="1131.15" dur="5.04">overwhelming Staphylococcus aureus</text>
  <text start="1132.919" dur="5.971">infection and/or that was complicated by</text>
  <text start="1136.19" dur="3.869">malnutrition now when you take a look at</text>
  <text start="1138.89" dur="2.279">that you&amp;#39;d say wow these parents are</text>
  <text start="1140.059" dur="3.181">extremely negligent like the</text>
  <text start="1141.169" dur="4.591">malnourished child like and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1143.24" dur="3.66">basing that off of initially on the</text>
  <text start="1145.76" dur="3.299">observations is that he was a small</text>
  <text start="1146.9" dur="5.43">child he was smaller than normal he was</text>
  <text start="1149.059" dur="6.511">he was about 1 percentile for his height</text>
  <text start="1152.33" dur="5.64">so he was he was quite small but the</text>
  <text start="1155.57" dur="4.53">interesting thing is is that um it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1157.97" dur="4.53">backwards because when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1160.1" dur="5.72">malnourished you don&amp;#39;t drink in height</text>
  <text start="1162.5" dur="6.99">or your your growth rate isn&amp;#39;t isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1165.82" dur="5.32">impaired before your weight is impaired</text>
  <text start="1169.49" dur="3.12">so you typically be extremely skinny</text>
  <text start="1171.14" dur="3.87">first and then it would sort of have a</text>
  <text start="1172.61" dur="3.72">negative impact on the the the</text>
  <text start="1175.01" dur="3.57">structuring of the bones and the growth</text>
  <text start="1176.33" dur="4.74">in there so the interesting thing is is</text>
  <text start="1178.58" dur="4.17">if you took a look at his percentile of</text>
  <text start="1181.07" dur="3.989">weight based on his height he was in the</text>
  <text start="1182.75" dur="5.429">98th percentile so he was actually a</text>
  <text start="1185.059" dur="4.681">chunky kid and so he had had meat on him</text>
  <text start="1188.179" dur="3.091">he was just smaller and the parents are</text>
  <text start="1189.74" dur="4.23">smaller so the genetic component there</text>
  <text start="1191.27" dur="4.2">is welted to take into consideration so</text>
  <text start="1193.97" dur="4.11">what they did to try to substantiate</text>
  <text start="1195.47" dur="3.75">this malnourishment is the medical</text>
  <text start="1198.08" dur="3.9">examiner</text>
  <text start="1199.22" dur="6.21">didn&amp;#39;t take a look at the the vitamin</text>
  <text start="1201.98" dur="4.14">and mineral the nutrient levels in the</text>
  <text start="1205.43" dur="3.6">four o&amp;#39;clock</text>
  <text start="1206.12" dur="4.32">blood culture that they took when he</text>
  <text start="1209.03" dur="3.3">arrived at the hospital what she did is</text>
  <text start="1210.44" dur="4.17">she drew blood from him three days after</text>
  <text start="1212.33" dur="3.9">being dead and TAS did that blood</text>
  <text start="1214.61" dur="3.72">couldn&amp;#39;t get a zinc rating because if</text>
  <text start="1216.23" dur="4.65">blood was too degraded to show up a</text>
  <text start="1218.33" dur="5.07">reading on the zinc got a normal Foley</text>
  <text start="1220.88" dur="4.38">rating but then God extremely low levels</text>
  <text start="1223.4" dur="3.33">of vitamin D and vitamin A and so they</text>
  <text start="1225.26" dur="4.17">used that to substantiate that he had</text>
  <text start="1226.73" dur="5.49">malnourished and ignoring all of the</text>
  <text start="1229.43" dur="4.83">normal readings that had he had had a</text>
  <text start="1232.22" dur="4.1">four o&amp;#39;clock upon presentation to the</text>
  <text start="1234.26" dur="4.89">hospital before they diluted his blood</text>
  <text start="1236.32" dur="5.32">by more than by more than two times and</text>
  <text start="1239.15" dur="5.1">so they were really grasping at straws</text>
  <text start="1241.64" dur="4.38">here to try to crucify the parents and</text>
  <text start="1244.25" dur="3.3">then what they did is that that four</text>
  <text start="1246.02" dur="3.78">o&amp;#39;clock reading of blood that they took</text>
  <text start="1247.55" dur="4.08">in cultured for five days it showed up</text>
  <text start="1249.8" dur="2.51">with no culture whatsoever and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1251.63" dur="2.67">saying it&amp;#39;s an overwhelming</text>
  <text start="1252.31" dur="4.21">Staphylococcus infection that was</text>
  <text start="1254.3" dur="4.62">creating these symptoms of the necrosis</text>
  <text start="1256.52" dur="3.93">on the toes and that it was creating</text>
  <text start="1258.92" dur="3.03">hypothermia which is extremely rare</text>
  <text start="1260.45" dur="3.6">because you typically present with an</text>
  <text start="1261.95" dur="3.51">extreme fever so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s actually on</text>
  <text start="1264.05" dur="3.3">the opposite end of what you would</text>
  <text start="1265.46" dur="5.39">typically see and he never had a fever</text>
  <text start="1267.35" dur="5.55">at any point during his illness and so</text>
  <text start="1270.85" dur="3.55">so what they&amp;#39;re saying is it was this</text>
  <text start="1272.9" dur="2.85">overwhelming infection but yet there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1274.4" dur="3.33">no overwhelming evidence to substantiate</text>
  <text start="1275.75" dur="4.71">it in fact there was really little to no</text>
  <text start="1277.73" dur="4.14">evidence it&amp;#39;s substantiated except for</text>
  <text start="1280.46" dur="4.59">when they took another blood culture of</text>
  <text start="1281.87" dur="4.29">five o&amp;#39;clock so after being in the</text>
  <text start="1285.05" dur="4.26">hospital setting for nearly two hours</text>
  <text start="1286.16" dur="5.4">and it showed up a cultured after five</text>
  <text start="1289.31" dur="5.31">days with Staphylococcus aureus which is</text>
  <text start="1291.56" dur="5.04">a very common bacterial strain that you</text>
  <text start="1294.62" dur="5.25">will find within the hospital setting</text>
  <text start="1296.6" dur="5.43">right so here they&amp;#39;re grasping at straws</text>
  <text start="1299.87" dur="3.93">there there&amp;#39;s no clear-cut scientific</text>
  <text start="1302.03" dur="3.9">evidence to say that that&amp;#39;s what he died</text>
  <text start="1303.8" dur="3.93">from and what they&amp;#39;re doing at the same</text>
  <text start="1305.93" dur="4.17">time is they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re shying away from</text>
  <text start="1307.73" dur="3.48">looking at okay yet hypothermia that</text>
  <text start="1310.1" dur="3.9">would likely be caused by hyponatremia</text>
  <text start="1311.21" dur="4.02">and we increase the saline fluids at</text>
  <text start="1314" dur="2.58">such a high rate that would create this</text>
  <text start="1315.23" dur="3.05">awesome art demyelination syndrome which</text>
  <text start="1316.58" dur="3.87">would have don&amp;#39;t create that brain death</text>
  <text start="1318.28" dur="4.72">or brain damage in those areas that</text>
  <text start="1320.45" dur="4.44">would have caused the death and they</text>
  <text start="1323" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t examine that at all even though</text>
  <text start="1324.89" dur="4.47">the medical examiner was aware that this</text>
  <text start="1326.9" dur="4.17">had had taken place what she testified</text>
  <text start="1329.36" dur="3.6">was that&amp;#39;s not her expertise Sheldon</text>
  <text start="1331.07" dur="4.32">dealt with a living patient since two</text>
  <text start="1332.96" dur="4.199">one and so she said it&amp;#39;s not my</text>
  <text start="1335.39" dur="4.32">expertise and so she kind of feel per</text>
  <text start="1337.159" dur="5.971">hand said I you know I claim I know</text>
  <text start="1339.71" dur="5.939">ignorance to this matter and so what the</text>
  <text start="1343.13" dur="4.26">the defense lawyer said well you are</text>
  <text start="1345.649" dur="3.811">aware that people die from this right</text>
  <text start="1347.39" dur="3.72">and said well yeah well shouldn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1349.46" dur="3.449">know that then so that&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="1351.11" dur="3.36">you would look into to see if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1352.909" dur="3.661">what he died from as a medical examiner</text>
  <text start="1354.47" dur="3.63">as a forensic pathologist you should you</text>
  <text start="1356.57" dur="3.089">know be aware that so it was really</text>
  <text start="1358.1" dur="3.36">interesting to see how she was just</text>
  <text start="1359.659" dur="2.941">claiming ignorance and as to why she</text>
  <text start="1361.46" dur="3.9">wouldn&amp;#39;t even looked into that because</text>
  <text start="1362.6" dur="4.439">it was out of her level of expertise but</text>
  <text start="1365.36" dur="3.449">yet that she would grasp at straws for</text>
  <text start="1367.039" dur="4.681">this overwhelming infection with</text>
  <text start="1368.809" dur="5.011">complicate by mount nutrition the second</text>
  <text start="1371.72" dur="3.66">thing is we didn&amp;#39;t talk about what the</text>
  <text start="1373.82" dur="3.15">causation of the necrosis of the tones</text>
  <text start="1375.38" dur="3.299">would have put it if it was an</text>
  <text start="1376.97" dur="3.99">infectious agent like they claimed it</text>
  <text start="1378.679" dur="6.961">was it would have presented inevitably</text>
  <text start="1380.96" dur="7.56">with a real putrid odor and none of the</text>
  <text start="1385.64" dur="5.58">doctors none of the nurses the parents</text>
  <text start="1388.52" dur="3.84">nobody noticed his putrid odor but in</text>
  <text start="1391.22" dur="3.059">fact what they did notice is that there</text>
  <text start="1392.36" dur="3">was a circulatory issue all the way</text>
  <text start="1394.279" dur="2.52">through the foot and started going to</text>
  <text start="1395.36" dur="3.949">the leg that would have created that</text>
  <text start="1396.799" dur="5.37">they did a CT scan of him at one point</text>
  <text start="1399.309" dur="5.74">on his on his body on his upper body</text>
  <text start="1402.169" dur="4.321">there and found him in fear been a cave</text>
  <text start="1405.049" dur="3.271">I which is a main vein coming up from</text>
  <text start="1406.49" dur="3.78">the legs bringing the blood back up to</text>
  <text start="1408.32" dur="3.81">the heart is that there was the thrombus</text>
  <text start="1410.27" dur="4.83">a thrombus that would create which is a</text>
  <text start="1412.13" dur="5.49">fibrous clot which creates the condition</text>
  <text start="1415.1" dur="5.04">of thrombosis you know it creates a</text>
  <text start="1417.62" dur="6.36">restriction in blood flow and that</text>
  <text start="1420.14" dur="6.21">thrombus alone could have created then</text>
  <text start="1423.98" dur="3.75">it crosses on the toes but if you have</text>
  <text start="1426.35" dur="4.35">one thrombus it&amp;#39;s quite likely that you</text>
  <text start="1427.73" dur="5.189">may have more and what they never looked</text>
  <text start="1430.7" dur="3.599">at the medical examiner is they ignore</text>
  <text start="1432.919" dur="2.911">that evidence even though she was made</text>
  <text start="1434.299" dur="3.48">aware of it ignored it altogether</text>
  <text start="1435.83" dur="4.02">because hey if you find something you</text>
  <text start="1437.779" dur="3.451">have to document it or cover it up you</text>
  <text start="1439.85" dur="3.209">know substantive lis so it&amp;#39;s better to</text>
  <text start="1441.23" dur="4.049">sit turn a blind eye to it they never</text>
  <text start="1443.059" dur="4.23">looked into the lower veins and the legs</text>
  <text start="1445.279" dur="4.02">to see if there was any more promises</text>
  <text start="1447.289" dur="4.231">that would be constricting the blood</text>
  <text start="1449.299" dur="3.211">flow to and cream.that circulatory</text>
  <text start="1451.52" dur="3.72">concernment</text>
  <text start="1452.51" dur="5.34">that that was observed by all of the</text>
  <text start="1455.24" dur="4.89">first responders to Little John Wayne</text>
  <text start="1457.85" dur="5.52">Clark so they were turning a blind eye</text>
  <text start="1460.13" dur="5.619">to the actual causation of death being</text>
  <text start="1463.37" dur="3.49">that hyponatremia or the over</text>
  <text start="1465.749" dur="3.211">stealing correction for the</text>
  <text start="1466.86" dur="4.649">hypernatremia and then what was actually</text>
  <text start="1468.96" dur="4.469">causing the the the necrosis of the toes</text>
  <text start="1471.509" dur="4.351">which rapidly spread once he got to the</text>
  <text start="1473.429" dur="4.38">hospital so if it was showing up on</text>
  <text start="1475.86" dur="4.59">November 27th at 6:21 p.m. when they did</text>
  <text start="1477.809" dur="4.86">a google search and then they see it</text>
  <text start="1480.45" dur="4.14">increasing rapidly the next day they</text>
  <text start="1482.669" dur="3.33">rushed him into the hospital and then by</text>
  <text start="1484.59" dur="3.689">the time he dies they take pictures and</text>
  <text start="1485.999" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s spread substantively to the point</text>
  <text start="1488.279" dur="4.76">where it&amp;#39;s not just block edging around</text>
  <text start="1489.659" dur="6.87">the toes it&amp;#39;s actually this entire toes</text>
  <text start="1493.039" dur="5.921">with that taking place you would you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1496.529" dur="3.691">think you know as a parent okay you know</text>
  <text start="1498.96" dur="2.849">you&amp;#39;re looking into stuff is it a blood</text>
  <text start="1500.22" dur="3.12">blister is it what is it you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1501.809" dur="4.32">something small then it rapidly</text>
  <text start="1503.34" dur="4.529">increases like that whatever it was I</text>
  <text start="1506.129" dur="4.081">mean if it was an infectious agent that</text>
  <text start="1507.869" dur="5.94">would be spreading extremely rapidly and</text>
  <text start="1510.21" dur="5.309">there was no no odor and this is</text>
  <text start="1513.809" dur="2.641">interesting that they kind of just shied</text>
  <text start="1515.519" dur="2.671">away from looking at the actual</text>
  <text start="1516.45" dur="4.169">causations of all the factors that he</text>
  <text start="1518.19" dur="4.319">had and avoided the the real causation</text>
  <text start="1520.619" dur="2.94">of death which happened within 15</text>
  <text start="1522.509" dur="2.85">minutes of him arriving at the hospital</text>
  <text start="1523.559" dur="4.32">and getting treatment for that</text>
  <text start="1525.359" dur="3.93">hyponatremia interesting thing is this</text>
  <text start="1527.879" dur="4.86">all comes out in in the court</text>

  <text start="1672.29" dur="3.33">draw their own conclusions but there was</text>
  <text start="1673.73" dur="4.08">clearly an issue there where they were</text>
  <text start="1675.62" dur="4.17">looking to push this forward and then</text>
  <text start="1677.81" dur="2.52">they rammed it forward with with the</text>
  <text start="1679.79" dur="2.25">police</text>
  <text start="1680.33" dur="3.42">pushing birds&amp;#39;ll charges of criminal</text>

  <text start="1687.02" dur="4.44">the police or not or abide by that or</text>
  <text start="1689.66" dur="3.36">not and in this case they did and then</text>
  <text start="1691.46" dur="3.6">they they went and raided the house and</text>
  <text start="1693.02" dur="3.39">found a bunch of supplements nutrients</text>
  <text start="1695.06" dur="4.14">like vitamin A and vitamin D that they</text>

  <text start="1704.63" dur="5.25">all that type of stuff so it was just</text>
  <text start="1705.98" dur="6.72">really interesting what what they did</text>
  <text start="1709.88" dur="4.08">here to ensure conviction and the</text>
  <text start="1712.7" dur="4.14">interesting thing was that the jury</text>

  <text start="1746.929" dur="3.84">more willing to lay blame than you are I</text>
  <text start="1748.429" dur="5.1">would I would say that any time there is</text>
  <text start="1750.769" dur="5.16">a powerful merger between the interests</text>

  <text start="1786.44" dur="4.229">very similar to how I see a lot of these</text>

  <text start="1827.299" dur="5.281">never see me not aware of a case of that</text>
  <text start="1830.389" dur="6">in fact there was just a recent case in</text>
  <text start="1832.58" dur="6.059">Canada wherein the charges were stayed</text>
  <text start="1836.389" dur="4.051">on a murder case because what happened</text>
  <text start="1838.639" dur="4.981">is the Crown Prosecution was was</text>
  <text start="1840.44" dur="5.43">involved in helping to destroy evidence</text>
  <text start="1843.62" dur="4.649">that was sculpt Ettore for the the</text>

  <text start="1848.269" dur="3.63">that this took place what the Crown</text>
  <text start="1850.19" dur="3.449">Prosecution sought to have was a</text>

  <text start="1860.539" dur="4.591">now they&amp;#39;re trying to actually make it</text>
  <text start="1863.33" dur="2.67">so that the public isn&amp;#39;t aware of the</text>

  <text start="1870.2" dur="4.2">about a mission of ensuring justice I</text>
  <text start="1873.08" dur="4.05">mean in fact we&amp;#39;re not seeing that at</text>
  <text start="1874.4" dur="4.82">all this has nothing to do with justice</text>
  <text start="1877.13" dur="5.27">because justice is fully predicated upon</text>
  <text start="1879.22" dur="6.19">ensuring that the principle of truth is</text>
  <text start="1882.4" dur="5.95">fully brought to light and what they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1890.69" dur="3.48">from even coming forward all together to</text>

  <text start="1894.17" dur="4.41">completely backwards as how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1896.63" dur="3.96">operating here at least in Canada and I</text>
  <text start="1898.58" dur="5.13">would presume it&amp;#39;s identical within the</text>

  <text start="1964.3" dur="5.56">at this point it&amp;#39;s a conspiracy fact I</text>
  <text start="1967.61" dur="5.42">mean there are different varieties of</text>

  <text start="1973.03" dur="3.52">implications what they&amp;#39;re doing all of</text>
  <text start="1974.93" dur="3.72">that is real obvious and anyone who</text>
  <text start="1976.55" dur="3.54">doesn&amp;#39;t want to see those things you</text>

  <text start="1995.24" dur="3.21">we have to take our health back because</text>
  <text start="1996.98" dur="2.94">the stuff that they were taught is</text>

  <text start="1999.92" dur="4.86">in one way or another viet vaccines or</text>

  <text start="2030.25" dur="4.95">it&amp;#39;s what a terrible way for both of</text>
  <text start="2032.86" dur="4.53">those children to have to die and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2035.2" dur="5.16">entirely preventable and those who are</text>
  <text start="2037.39" dur="4.95">truly responsible for it are actually</text>
  <text start="2040.36" dur="2.94">blaming the victims which is the parents</text>
  <text start="2042.34" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="2043.3" dur="4.89">a secondary abomination to me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2045.88" dur="5.1">disgusting and they get away with it</text>
  <text start="2048.19" dur="6.959">because people just often don&amp;#39;t care to</text>
  <text start="2050.98" dur="5.49">look it&amp;#39;s really peculiar when you take</text>
  <text start="2055.149" dur="3.661">a look at how many children would be</text>
  <text start="2056.47" dur="5.49">dying out of delbert of children to this</text>

  <text start="2223.9" dur="4.68">for a long time now we&amp;#39;re starting to</text>
  <text start="2226.9" dur="3.78">see that swing back for the other way</text>
  <text start="2228.58" dur="4.23">the pendulum has kind of come full swing</text>
  <text start="2230.68" dur="3.6">and people are waking up to this in</text>
  <text start="2232.81" dur="3.51">droves there&amp;#39;s a lot of energy and I</text>
  <text start="2234.28" dur="5.4">know at least it is here I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2236.32" dur="5.19">about in Canada you said earlier you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2239.68" dur="4.17">not getting a lot of success with wood</text>
  <text start="2241.51" dur="3.72">maybe sharing this or they were not</text>

  <text start="2245.23" dur="4.29">against it that&amp;#39;s right you know it was</text>
  <text start="2247.57" dur="4.89">really really interesting but it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2249.52" dur="5.19">the the snowball has begun to roll and</text>
  <text start="2252.46" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s picking up momentum now I just did</text>
  <text start="2254.71" dur="6.27">three interviews yesterday starting at</text>
  <text start="2257.23" dur="7.02">9:00 in the morning until til early you</text>
  <text start="2260.98" dur="4.92">mean on the matter and so we&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="2264.25" dur="3.48">to get some attention now from from</text>
  <text start="2265.9" dur="4.14">individuals like yourself taken interest</text>
  <text start="2267.73" dur="4.379">and getting it out there but it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="2270.04" dur="3.96">a hurdle to get over because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2272.109" dur="3.871">really battling the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="2274" dur="5.52">this is what we found in our case is</text>
  <text start="2275.98" dur="5.7">that you know we&amp;#39;re a lot we exist in a</text>
  <text start="2279.52" dur="3.36">community you know like a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2281.68" dur="2.52">know us you know we&amp;#39;ve been in the</text>
  <text start="2282.88" dur="4.5">natural health industry for a very long</text>
  <text start="2284.2" dur="5.79">time and a lot of parents would even</text>
  <text start="2287.38" dur="4.38">come in and consult with us asking you</text>
  <text start="2289.99" dur="3.629">know what should we do with our child</text>
  <text start="2291.76" dur="3.03">here or there or whatever you know to</text>
  <text start="2293.619" dur="2.911">this matter this chronic health</text>
  <text start="2294.79" dur="3.12">condition that type of stuff and so even</text>
  <text start="2296.53" dur="3.12">though you know I&amp;#39;m not a natural path</text>
  <text start="2297.91" dur="3.959">or homeopathy or or even you know I</text>
  <text start="2299.65" dur="4.469">don&amp;#39;t have a practice I do a lot of</text>
  <text start="2301.869" dur="4.191">traveling across Canada doing public</text>
  <text start="2304.119" dur="4.591">presentations and whatnot educating on</text>
  <text start="2306.06" dur="4.33">mental health and correcting those</text>
  <text start="2308.71" dur="3.659">issues but parents would come to us and</text>
  <text start="2310.39" dur="6.03">do this so you know we were being</text>
  <text start="2312.369" dur="5.851">perceived as crazies and yet what the</text>
  <text start="2316.42" dur="5.25">media did though is he effectively</text>
  <text start="2318.22" dur="5.25">created a vibe within the whole populace</text>
  <text start="2321.67" dur="3.3">so if you take all the you know if you</text>
  <text start="2323.47" dur="6.12">for lack of better terms</text>
  <text start="2324.97" dur="7.08">crunchy people holistic people that</text>
  <text start="2329.59" dur="4.32">aren&amp;#39;t vaccinating what the media</text>
  <text start="2332.05" dur="3.99">effectively did initially and that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2333.91" dur="5.4">had to really work to get over is they</text>
  <text start="2336.04" dur="6.3">couldn&amp;#39;t divide between us and everybody</text>
  <text start="2339.31" dur="6.15">else that people were after to like holy</text>
  <text start="2342.34" dur="5.64">crap the Stephan&amp;#39;s or making all of us</text>
  <text start="2345.46" dur="4.11">look bad because of the crazy stuff that</text>
  <text start="2347.98" dur="3.27">they that they did and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2349.57" dur="3.6">basing their their judgment or their</text>
  <text start="2351.25" dur="3.54">creating a judgment off of the false</text>
  <text start="2353.17" dur="2.64">information or the twisting and</text>
  <text start="2354.79" dur="3.45">distortions that the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="2355.81" dur="3.809">was doing now the mainstream media was</text>
  <text start="2358.24" dur="5.04">doing the same thing with the Clarkes</text>
  <text start="2359.619" dur="5.101">word off the bat in fact CBC CDC is the</text>
  <text start="2363.28" dur="3.42">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and</text>
  <text start="2364.72" dur="3.86">it&amp;#39;s interesting because you get the</text>
  <text start="2366.7" dur="5.55">Crown Prosecution looking for a</text>
  <text start="2368.58" dur="7.15">conviction and CBC is actually a crown</text>
  <text start="2372.25" dur="6.39">owned corporation so if people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2375.73" dur="6">recognizing that the main news source in</text>
  <text start="2378.64" dur="5.64">Canada is on side with the crown they</text>
  <text start="2381.73" dur="3.84">are on the same team that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2384.28" dur="2.76">getting you know their funding through</text>
  <text start="2385.57" dur="3.9">the taxpayer money but they&amp;#39;re part of</text>
  <text start="2387.04" dur="5.37">the same organization and so the CBC was</text>
  <text start="2389.47" dur="5.88">actually before it even got into trial</text>
  <text start="2392.41" dur="6.6">they were headlining how John Wyatt</text>
  <text start="2395.35" dur="5.969">Clarke had starved to death so what they</text>
  <text start="2399.01" dur="4.38">did is they took this information that</text>
  <text start="2401.319" dur="4.71">medical examiner had gotten from</text>
  <text start="2403.39" dur="4.109">three-day-old dead blood showing that he</text>
  <text start="2406.029" dur="4.17">was low on a few nutrients which of</text>
  <text start="2407.499" dur="5.31">course you would be it&amp;#39;s dead blood it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2410.199" dur="4.41">degrading and his diluted blood at that</text>
  <text start="2412.809" dur="3.871">so it&amp;#39;s been more dazzled by more than</text>
  <text start="2414.609" dur="4.021">two times and they took that information</text>
  <text start="2416.68" dur="4.889">and now said he starved to death and he</text>
  <text start="2418.63" dur="5.79">actually headlined that on two different</text>
  <text start="2421.569" dur="5.25">articles leading up to the trial and so</text>
  <text start="2424.42" dur="6.539">right off the bat this is going to</text>
  <text start="2426.819" dur="6.39">create a major divide between people</text>
  <text start="2430.959" dur="5.34">that would normally relate to the</text>
  <text start="2433.209" dur="5.34">clerk&amp;#39;s or relate to us so it&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="2436.299" dur="5.46">big uphill battle because the mainstream</text>
  <text start="2438.549" dur="5.49">media has in in concert because all the</text>
  <text start="2441.759" dur="3.45">other media sources get online they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2444.039" dur="2.79">all being backed by the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="2445.209" dur="3.15">industry it&amp;#39;s a little bit different</text>
  <text start="2446.829" dur="3.62">here in Canada than it is in the US</text>
  <text start="2448.359" dur="4.59">because you don&amp;#39;t have near as much</text>
  <text start="2450.449" dur="4.06">direct to consumer advertising from the</text>
  <text start="2452.949" dur="3.54">pharmaceutical industry so we see it</text>
  <text start="2454.509" dur="5.161">differently here we see it where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2456.489" dur="4.921">they&amp;#39;re in a major financial crisis and</text>
  <text start="2459.67" dur="4.289">it appears that there they prostitute</text>
  <text start="2461.41" dur="4.77">themselves note and what we see is you</text>
  <text start="2463.959" dur="4.53">know for example The Globe and Mail</text>
  <text start="2466.18" dur="3.929">which is a big news outlet Canada wide</text>
  <text start="2468.489" dur="4.26">news outlet you see their health</text>
  <text start="2470.109" dur="5.91">columnist whose name is andre picard</text>
  <text start="2472.749" dur="5.131">interestingly he actually is a traveling</text>
  <text start="2476.019" dur="3.51">in for lack of better terms a traveling</text>
  <text start="2477.88" dur="3.78">salesman for the pharmaceutical industry</text>
  <text start="2479.529" dur="5.43">going around promoting vaccines like</text>
  <text start="2481.66" dur="4.74">shin rex and so here when he&amp;#39;s not doing</text>
  <text start="2484.959" dur="4.711">his job at the global mail</text>
  <text start="2486.4" dur="6.209">he&amp;#39;s on payroll for the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="2489.67" dur="4.649">industry and so now they basically</text>
  <text start="2492.609" dur="5.13">plants like that that are actually</text>
  <text start="2494.319" dur="5.94">publishing documents or publishing</text>
  <text start="2497.739" dur="3.901">articles on behalf of the pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="2500.259" dur="3.06">industry so that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="2501.64" dur="5.04">hero nothing as advertisement we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2503.319" dur="4.89">seeing it as factual articles that</text>
  <text start="2506.68" dur="3.779">people would normally trust more so than</text>
  <text start="2508.209" dur="4.171">an advertisement so in many instances</text>
  <text start="2510.459" dur="3.961">it&amp;#39;s far worse than what it is in the US</text>
  <text start="2512.38" dur="3.929">but it&amp;#39;s been an uphill battle to get</text>
  <text start="2514.42" dur="3.99">the support but it&amp;#39;s starting to happen</text>
  <text start="2516.309" dur="4.14">that like I said that snowball is</text>
  <text start="2518.41" dur="4.199">rolling but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been an issue</text>
  <text start="2520.449" dur="6.691">because the media has done a fantastic</text>
  <text start="2522.609" dur="6.42">job of creating that dividing fad for</text>
  <text start="2527.14" dur="3.51">the division between people that would</text>
  <text start="2529.029" dur="2.82">normally relate and say wow no I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2530.65" dur="2.52">just like the Stephan&amp;#39;s I could find</text>
  <text start="2531.849" dur="2.911">myself in the same situation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2533.17" dur="2.7">saying no we never do with the Stefan</text>
  <text start="2534.76" dur="4.89">that or we&amp;#39;d never do what the Clarks</text>
  <text start="2535.87" dur="6.33">did it&amp;#39;s absolutely crazy yeah well I do</text>
  <text start="2539.65" dur="4.08">the same things myself I mean I if a</text>
  <text start="2542.2" dur="2.97">normal person were to look at me they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2543.73" dur="3.24">probably think I&amp;#39;m crazy I grow</text>
  <text start="2545.17" dur="4.29">microgreens and I take all kinds of</text>
  <text start="2546.97" dur="5.61">vitamins and supplements and you know I</text>
  <text start="2549.46" dur="5.85">made my own like tea blend you know for</text>
  <text start="2552.58" dur="4.59">for bones and health like that so you</text>
  <text start="2555.31" dur="3.93">know that&amp;#39;s extreme because most people</text>
  <text start="2557.17" dur="3.84">their idea of eating healthy is just</text>
  <text start="2559.24" dur="4.68">let&amp;#39;s skip the soda today and just have</text>
  <text start="2561.01" dur="5.55">normal fast food and water I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2563.92" dur="4.89">not that&amp;#39;s clearly represented in every</text>
  <text start="2566.56" dur="6.12">bit of statistics on every end of the</text>
  <text start="2568.81" dur="5.49">spectrum in the health trends but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2572.68" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s almost as like it&amp;#39;s Halloween so</text>
  <text start="2574.3" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s good metaphor to use it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2576.01" dur="5.58">almost like a really bad b-movie like a</text>
  <text start="2578.5" dur="5.19">horror flick where you know there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2581.59" dur="3.72">bullet not - not to be crass but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2583.69" dur="3.48">the blood of a child and then they use</text>
  <text start="2585.31" dur="3.87">it to cast this dark spell that makes</text>
  <text start="2587.17" dur="4.23">people hate each other based on lies and</text>
  <text start="2589.18" dur="4.74">deceptions it&amp;#39;s kind of like a metaphor</text>
  <text start="2591.4" dur="4.11">of how they&amp;#39;ve done here and it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2593.92" dur="3.18">that&amp;#39;s sort of how I see these things</text>
  <text start="2595.51" dur="3.75">because they&amp;#39;re doing it often</text>
  <text start="2597.1" dur="5.58">intentionally it&amp;#39;s not just a one-off</text>
  <text start="2599.26" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s a culture it&amp;#39;s across the media</text>
  <text start="2602.68" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re only owned by a few corporations</text>
  <text start="2604.09" dur="4.62">anyways so it&amp;#39;s very consolidated but</text>
  <text start="2606.01" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;ve really it&amp;#39;s across the the</text>
  <text start="2608.71" dur="4.89">education spectrum obviously a lot of</text>
  <text start="2610.48" dur="5.61">the the college professors and the</text>
  <text start="2613.6" dur="4.74">teachers at every level have have</text>
  <text start="2616.09" dur="5.79">adopted this sort of culture you know</text>
  <text start="2618.34" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a an anti-christian culture</text>
  <text start="2621.88" dur="3.69">often they you know I went through the</text>
  <text start="2623.65" dur="3.87">basic education system and I came out</text>
  <text start="2625.57" dur="4.17">thinking abortions were necessary</text>
  <text start="2627.52" dur="3.78">Christians were stupid and you know just</text>

  <text start="2632.77" dur="4.53">taught us and rammed down our throats</text>
  <text start="2634.71" dur="6.01">and I had to go through each of these</text>
  <text start="2637.3" dur="6.45">situations and learn it took me years to</text>
  <text start="2640.72" dur="5.34">kind of evolve my my viewpoints based on</text>
  <text start="2643.75" dur="5.82">real data that I never heard in school</text>
  <text start="2646.06" dur="6">you know I&amp;#39;m 31 now but it&amp;#39;s much worse</text>
  <text start="2649.57" dur="5.22">now for kids these days I remember how</text>
  <text start="2652.06" dur="4.44">bad it was and now it&amp;#39;s so I&amp;#39;ve done a</text>
  <text start="2654.79" dur="4.41">recent interview about the education</text>
  <text start="2656.5" dur="4.83">aspect is if we lose there all of these</text>
  <text start="2659.2" dur="3.93">other things were fighting for they just</text>
  <text start="2661.33" dur="3.59">get taken you know we have to have to</text>
  <text start="2663.13" dur="4.23">start with the children and educate</text>

  <text start="2670.42" dur="6.449">spitting on us in the future but I mean</text>
  <text start="2674.55" dur="5.59">anyone that listens to you talk and</text>
  <text start="2676.869" dur="4.801">clearly you know understand that you</text>
  <text start="2680.14" dur="3.9">know what you&amp;#39;re talking about like only</text>
  <text start="2681.67" dur="3.689">a father who&amp;#39;s lost a child could I mean</text>
  <text start="2684.04" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;ve got these issues pretty well</text>
  <text start="2685.359" dur="3.871">understood obviously in you like you</text>
  <text start="2688" dur="6.06">said you&amp;#39;re not even a doctor but you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2689.23" dur="6.36">you&amp;#39;ve really dove into these issues my</text>
  <text start="2694.06" dur="3.21">heart goes out to this other couple I</text>
  <text start="2695.59" dur="2.759">really wish the best for them I if</text>
  <text start="2697.27" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s anything else that I can do to</text>
  <text start="2698.349" dur="4.561">help kind of bring attention to that I</text>
  <text start="2700.57" dur="3.93">would like to we&amp;#39;ve had too many of</text>
  <text start="2702.91" dur="4.41">these stories now I mean what do you</text>
  <text start="2704.5" dur="7.56">think is gonna happen with this one you</text>
  <text start="2707.32" dur="6.75">know it&amp;#39;s hard to tell so I analyzed the</text>
  <text start="2712.06" dur="4.23">jury for the three weeks that I was in</text>
  <text start="2714.07" dur="4.44">there in the trial and I analyzed the</text>
  <text start="2716.29" dur="4.23">judge and I only missed one portion of</text>
  <text start="2718.51" dur="3.78">the trial and not with the city the</text>
  <text start="2720.52" dur="3.66">judges instruction to the jury because I</text>
  <text start="2722.29" dur="4.11">had to go back to a different city deal</text>
  <text start="2724.18" dur="4.71">with my own court issues as it was</text>
  <text start="2726.4" dur="5.94">overturned in the Supreme Court in May</text>
  <text start="2728.89" dur="4.949">of this year and by overturning our case</text>
  <text start="2732.34" dur="3.47">and our conviction section went to jail</text>
  <text start="2733.839" dur="4.441">for three weeks over the matter by</text>
  <text start="2735.81" dur="3.82">overturning it they send it back to</text>
  <text start="2738.28" dur="2.52">trial so I&amp;#39;m doing my own I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="2739.63" dur="3.93">juggling between my own travel this</text>
  <text start="2740.8" dur="4.23">trials so I miss one portion of it which</text>
  <text start="2743.56" dur="3.18">is only a couple hours and I had</text>
  <text start="2745.03" dur="5.04">somebody sit in for me and take notes</text>
  <text start="2746.74" dur="4.59">who was my trial so they they knew kind</text>
  <text start="2750.07" dur="2.789">of what to look forward to see if they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2751.33" dur="5.009">see the same kind of dirty garbage that</text>
  <text start="2752.859" dur="5.521">we saw during my trial and so analyzing</text>
  <text start="2756.339" dur="4.711">the jury and analyzing the judge what I</text>
  <text start="2758.38" dur="4.68">saw with the judge and and what was made</text>
  <text start="2761.05" dur="4.02">made known to me in the part that I</text>
  <text start="2763.06" dur="4.2">missed the judge instruct the jury was</text>
  <text start="2765.07" dur="4.11">that the judge may be the bundle II</text>
  <text start="2767.26" dur="4.89">clear that basically you&amp;#39;d have to find</text>
  <text start="2769.18" dur="5.85">this couple guilty or not guilty not</text>
  <text start="2772.15" dur="4.5">guilty based on the conflicting evidence</text>
  <text start="2775.03" dur="4.26">you can&amp;#39;t put weight on that really</text>
  <text start="2776.65" dur="4.65">based on the fact that did you know that</text>
  <text start="2779.29" dur="5.16">there could be another causation of</text>
  <text start="2781.3" dur="5.97">death if that&amp;#39;s found you can&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="2784.45" dur="4.26">can&amp;#39;t convict the parents for criminal</text>
  <text start="2787.27" dur="3.45">negligence resulting in death because</text>
  <text start="2788.71" dur="4.32">they didn&amp;#39;t result or their actions</text>
  <text start="2790.72" dur="3.54">didn&amp;#39;t result in his death and so he</text>
  <text start="2793.03" dur="3.45">made it abundantly clear and was</text>
  <text start="2794.26" dur="3.93">emphatically saying you know not guilty</text>
  <text start="2796.48" dur="5.43">not guilty not guilty through his jury</text>
  <text start="2798.19" dur="4.41">instruction and so when they came back</text>
  <text start="2801.91" dur="4.41">later that</text>
  <text start="2802.6" dur="6.63">at evening to deliberate to give the</text>
  <text start="2806.32" dur="6.96">verdict when they gave the verdict of</text>
  <text start="2809.23" dur="5.34">guilty I was watching the judge and he</text>
  <text start="2813.28" dur="2.76">you know they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2814.57" dur="6.23">professionals are what they do and they</text>
  <text start="2816.04" dur="8.22">they&amp;#39;ve got a good poker face but I saw</text>
  <text start="2820.8" dur="4.96">that he was appalled at the decision and</text>
  <text start="2824.26" dur="3.6">he had a hard time I&amp;#39;m composing himself</text>
  <text start="2825.76" dur="3.99">so I and he&amp;#39;s gonna be the one that</text>
  <text start="2827.86" dur="4.77">sentences the couple in about four</text>
  <text start="2829.75" dur="6.54">months in the in February of 2019 here</text>
  <text start="2832.63" dur="8.36">and so I&amp;#39;m going to suspect that this</text>
  <text start="2836.29" dur="8.1">judge is going to be as light and</text>
  <text start="2840.99" dur="6.58">lenient as possible in regard to the</text>
  <text start="2844.39" dur="5.07">sentencing which also goes to setting</text>
  <text start="2847.57" dur="4.71">the precedent because if he if he says</text>
  <text start="2849.46" dur="4.38">25 years in jail well now that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2852.28" dur="3.18">a precedent that&amp;#39;s sitting on the books</text>
  <text start="2853.84" dur="3.9">it said you know that the next time a</text>
  <text start="2855.46" dur="5.49">case of this comes up and let&amp;#39;s say that</text>
  <text start="2857.74" dur="4.89">the parents are convicted then you know</text>
  <text start="2860.95" dur="3.99">they can say well in this case they were</text>
  <text start="2862.63" dur="4.86">sentenced for 25 years so they can stack</text>
  <text start="2864.94" dur="5.88">on top of that to substantiate that this</text>
  <text start="2867.49" dur="7.47">is the norm here in Canada and so I</text>
  <text start="2870.82" dur="6.87">don&amp;#39;t foresee him really going hard on</text>
  <text start="2874.96" dur="5.07">them based on on the fact that I think</text>
  <text start="2877.69" dur="6">he was out nicely appalled because it</text>
  <text start="2880.03" dur="6.03">was complete miscarriage of justice in</text>
  <text start="2883.69" dur="4.88">regard to that conviction so what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2886.06" dur="4.41">currently doing to help assist with that</text>
  <text start="2888.57" dur="4.21">because criminal proceedings are</text>
  <text start="2890.47" dur="4.38">supposed to be theoretically based off</text>
  <text start="2892.78" dur="4.05">of the public interest now the media has</text>
  <text start="2894.85" dur="3.93">done a fantastic job in creating a false</text>
  <text start="2896.83" dur="4.44">sense of public interest surrounding</text>
  <text start="2898.78" dur="3.9">these types of cases where people are</text>
  <text start="2901.27" dur="2.76">actually cheering is a right to ripped</text>
  <text start="2902.68" dur="2.43">away from them but if people knew the</text>
  <text start="2904.03" dur="2.82">truth didn&amp;#39;t be a whole different story</text>
  <text start="2905.11" dur="5.43">and there there&amp;#39;d be a public outcry and</text>
  <text start="2906.85" dur="5.37">so what we&amp;#39;re doing is we&amp;#39;ve started up</text>
  <text start="2910.54" dur="5.45">a letter-writing campaign and so people</text>
  <text start="2912.22" dur="7.08">go onto my Facebook page they can see</text>
  <text start="2915.99" dur="4.72">that there&amp;#39;s videos on there or there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2919.3" dur="4.68">a video now I&amp;#39;m gonna do another one I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2920.71" dur="5.4">gonna continue to follow up with this to</text>
  <text start="2923.98" dur="5.76">give instructions on how to write a</text>
  <text start="2926.11" dur="7.23">letter that and where to email it to you</text>
  <text start="2929.74" dur="4.59">or to mail it to and we&amp;#39;ll take care of</text>
  <text start="2933.34" dur="2.7">those we&amp;#39;ll make sure they get to the</text>
  <text start="2934.33" dur="3.3">lawyers so that during</text>
  <text start="2936.04" dur="4.56">dancing that can be presented to the</text>
  <text start="2937.63" dur="5.58">judge this show that people are taking</text>
  <text start="2940.6" dur="4.53">major concern over the precedent that</text>
  <text start="2943.21" dur="4.32">the sets the message that it sends to</text>
  <text start="2945.13" dur="5.79">parents the removal of people&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="2947.53" dur="5.7">and freedoms here in Canada feeling you</text>
  <text start="2950.92" dur="5.55">know compelled to have to take their</text>
  <text start="2953.23" dur="5.25">children in to doctors when it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="2956.47" dur="3.3">know maybe needless it may have to be</text>
  <text start="2958.48" dur="5.58">exposing them to a greater danger</text>
  <text start="2959.77" dur="6.63">greater harm and so that that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2964.06" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;re doing right now to as a proactive</text>
  <text start="2966.4" dur="5.34">measure to try to help ensure that this</text>
  <text start="2969.73" dur="5.01">doesn&amp;#39;t go really sour because if it</text>
  <text start="2971.74" dur="4.77">does we&amp;#39;ve got a made but we already</text>
  <text start="2974.74" dur="5.49">have a major problem here in Canada but</text>
  <text start="2976.51" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;ll get worse guys this is the</text>
  <text start="2980.23" dur="3.69">forefront of the battle for Western</text>
  <text start="2982.69" dur="3.99">society as a whole I mean these</text>
  <text start="2983.92" dur="4.77">countries are basically mirror images of</text>
  <text start="2986.68" dur="4.53">each other in many ways today if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2988.69" dur="4.47">almost indistinguishable the the</text>
  <text start="2991.21" dur="4.41">bureaucracy and the corruption and the</text>
  <text start="2993.16" dur="5.85">the Krone iasts merger of state power</text>
  <text start="2995.62" dur="5.58">and big business it&amp;#39;s gotten so bad</text>
  <text start="2999.01" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re coming for all of us if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3001.2" dur="5.01">stand together we&amp;#39;ll fall one by one</text>
  <text start="3003.12" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s how the saying goes David have we</text>
  <text start="3006.21" dur="3.87">have we covered everything that you</text>
  <text start="3008.37" dur="5.37">think was that needs to be brought out</text>
  <text start="3010.08" dur="5.85">for the public on this issue I think so</text>
  <text start="3013.74" dur="5.63">I think to you know just encapsulate</text>
  <text start="3015.93" dur="7.08">that yeah but what they&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="3019.37" dur="5.47">rather than creating medical mandates</text>
  <text start="3023.01" dur="6.44">through Acts of Parliament or through</text>
  <text start="3024.84" dur="7.77">the typical government channels they are</text>
  <text start="3029.45" dur="5.02">skirting around that through court</text>
  <text start="3032.61" dur="5.91">proceedings where they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="3034.47" dur="6.27">charges or misusing charges within the</text>
  <text start="3038.52" dur="5.01">Criminal Code to ram these these agendas</text>
  <text start="3040.74" dur="4.53">through on a much greater greater level</text>
  <text start="3043.53" dur="3.21">and people aren&amp;#39;t catching on to it and</text>
  <text start="3045.27" dur="4.32">people need to be just really aware of</text>
  <text start="3046.74" dur="4.65">what&amp;#39;s taking place that most people are</text>
  <text start="3049.59" dur="3.96">used to fighting you know parliamentary</text>
  <text start="3051.39" dur="3.27">debates and or involved themselves in</text>
  <text start="3053.55" dur="4.47">parliamentary debates and all sort of</text>
  <text start="3054.66" dur="5.19">stuff to - you know effectively sway it</text>
  <text start="3058.02" dur="4.65">one way or the other is - what they put</text>
  <text start="3059.85" dur="4.26">into law but realistically what&amp;#39;s taking</text>
  <text start="3062.67" dur="3.09">place is the law is actually being</text>
  <text start="3064.11" dur="2.97">established through the court settings</text>
  <text start="3065.76" dur="3.51">and people aren&amp;#39;t being made aware of</text>
  <text start="3067.08" dur="2.67">that and so it&amp;#39;s a banana much wrappered</text>
  <text start="3069.27" dur="2.4">more rather</text>
  <text start="3069.75" dur="3">rate than people are aware of so far we</text>
  <text start="3071.67" dur="3.96">just need to be made aware that the</text>
  <text start="3072.75" dur="4.14">tyranny is alive and well which most</text>
  <text start="3075.63" dur="3.48">people are aware of but that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3076.89" dur="5.22">happening in a much more covertly way</text>
  <text start="3079.11" dur="5.4">than they anticipated yeah</text>
  <text start="3082.11" dur="4.14">and they will use it as a club to smash</text>
  <text start="3084.51" dur="3.78">down every single parent that they come</text>
  <text start="3086.25" dur="4.29">across that doesn&amp;#39;t go with the system</text>
  <text start="3088.29" dur="6.9">of you know poisoning their child with</text>
  <text start="3090.54" dur="6.9">all these pharmaceuticals to do it the</text>
  <text start="3095.19" dur="4.41">falsification in regard to my own case</text>
  <text start="3097.44" dur="4.86">which will you know there&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="3099.6" dur="4.26">lot more point on that soon but what it</text>
  <text start="3102.3" dur="3.3">appears is they destroyed evidence</text>
  <text start="3103.86" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ve falsified evidence and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3105.6" dur="4.38">withheld evidence to ensure that they</text>
  <text start="3107.34" dur="4.68">got that first conviction and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3109.98" dur="5.19">gonna see the same thing coming up in</text>
  <text start="3112.02" dur="4.53">the next court proceedings I&amp;#39;m sure and</text>
  <text start="3115.17" dur="4.29">so these are the lengths that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3116.55" dur="5.51">willing to go to to make this happen is</text>
  <text start="3119.46" dur="6.2">that they&amp;#39;re not playing fair whatsoever</text>
  <text start="3122.06" dur="6.76">it&amp;#39;s deception right from the get-go you</text>
  <text start="3125.66" dur="5.14">know power I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="3128.82" dur="4.62">heard of the Lucifer effect but when</text>
  <text start="3130.8" dur="4.5">those who are given power become more</text>
  <text start="3133.44" dur="5.55">corrupted by it and start to become</text>
  <text start="3135.3" dur="6.24">meaner and more more bullying and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3138.99" dur="3.93">very real phenomenon you can just check</text>
  <text start="3141.54" dur="5.34">out for those who are curious the</text>
  <text start="3142.92" dur="6.03">Stanford Prison Experiment but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3146.88" dur="5.58">gotten so bad at this point that those</text>
  <text start="3148.95" dur="5.73">in power see some of us as lesser beings</text>
  <text start="3152.46" dur="3.42">or as a second-class citizen or</text>
  <text start="3154.68" dur="3.6">something like that they don&amp;#39;t treat us</text>
  <text start="3155.88" dur="5.16">in a human way they do what is necessary</text>
  <text start="3158.28" dur="4.17">to push their agenda through a lot of</text>
  <text start="3161.04" dur="2.82">that&amp;#39;s got to do with the propaganda and</text>
  <text start="3162.45" dur="2.49">the confusion because many times they</text>
  <text start="3163.86" dur="2.85">actually believe they&amp;#39;re doing the right</text>
  <text start="3164.94" dur="3.3">thing and they&amp;#39;re maybe saving kids from</text>
  <text start="3166.71" dur="3.41">stupid parents they&amp;#39;re just backwater</text>
  <text start="3168.24" dur="3.87">and not doing their vaccines and stuff</text>
  <text start="3170.12" dur="3.91">but they don&amp;#39;t understand the true</text>
  <text start="3172.11" dur="4.08">context the true history I mean even</text>
  <text start="3174.03" dur="4.59">Jonas Salk with the first vaccine the</text>
  <text start="3176.19" dur="4.77">polio vaccine he wrote a book survival</text>
  <text start="3178.62" dur="4.44">of the wisest it was all about vaccines</text>
  <text start="3180.96" dur="5.46">and eugenics and experimenting on people</text>
  <text start="3183.06" dur="5.19">and and the book&amp;#39;s name says it all kind</text>
  <text start="3186.42" dur="5.01">of like the Bill Gates figure is how I</text>
  <text start="3188.25" dur="4.44">describe him and in every since then you</text>
  <text start="3191.43" dur="3.06">know all of these diseases that were</text>
  <text start="3192.69" dur="3.36">supposedly wiped out it&amp;#39;s all a lie they</text>
  <text start="3194.49" dur="3.18">were already there they were already</text>
  <text start="3196.05" dur="4.14">going away because of it you know</text>
  <text start="3197.67" dur="5.1">advanced plumbing and better living</text>
  <text start="3200.19" dur="3.57">conditions but then the vaccines keep</text>
  <text start="3202.77" dur="2.76">claiming the credit</text>
  <text start="3203.76" dur="3.54">and this is just one example vaccines</text>
  <text start="3205.53" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s other things as well like GMO</text>
  <text start="3207.3" dur="3.93">foods and stuff but we have to wake up</text>
  <text start="3209.7" dur="6.51">to our personal responsibilities we have</text>
  <text start="3211.23" dur="7.08">to to form a coalition to fight back</text>

  <text start="3218.31" dur="3.27">like a fox in a henhouse they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="3219.78" dur="4.98">gonna come after our freedoms and then</text>
  <text start="3221.58" dur="5.06">destroy them for fun not even to eat but</text>
  <text start="3224.76" dur="4.91">just for fun because it&amp;#39;s what they do</text>
  <text start="3226.64" dur="6.46">one by one until there&amp;#39;s nothing left</text>
  <text start="3229.67" dur="5.47">that effect that you&amp;#39;re talking about I</text>
  <text start="3233.1" dur="3.93">can&amp;#39;t remember it fully clearly as over</text>
  <text start="3235.14" dur="3.66">a decade ago I was student studying on</text>
  <text start="3237.03" dur="4.11">this in regard to Authority and power</text>
  <text start="3238.8" dur="4.11">and what drives people to seek for</text>
  <text start="3241.14" dur="3.84">political positions and whatnot in many</text>
  <text start="3242.91" dur="6.12">instances if it&amp;#39;s not altruistic motives</text>
  <text start="3244.98" dur="7.59">and it&amp;#39;s interesting during the the</text>
  <text start="3249.03" dur="5.04">study of that that it&amp;#39;s been discovered</text>
  <text start="3252.57" dur="3.84">or that when you&amp;#39;re in a position of</text>
  <text start="3254.07" dur="3.93">power and you incite or you knock that</text>
  <text start="3256.41" dur="3.57">power of somebody else even just have</text>
  <text start="3258" dur="3.51">messed them over that it actually fires</text>
  <text start="3259.98" dur="4.11">up the same areas of the brain as if you</text>
  <text start="3261.51" dur="5.28">just took a hit of cocaine so it</text>
  <text start="3264.09" dur="5.43">actually becomes a drug now so many</text>
  <text start="3266.79" dur="5.94">people they&amp;#39;re their drug of choice is</text>
  <text start="3269.52" dur="5.31">power it is exercising power over other</text>
  <text start="3272.73" dur="6.03">people and so people need to be made</text>
  <text start="3274.83" dur="5.4">aware of that that you know it&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="3278.76" dur="3.99">you have addicts everywhere and that</text>
  <text start="3280.23" dur="3.51">sometimes you know we gotta the question</text>
  <text start="3282.75" dur="1.92">comes out well why would they do that</text>
  <text start="3283.74" dur="2.94">why would they do that</text>
  <text start="3284.67" dur="4.02">well because it&amp;#39;s like they just took a</text>
  <text start="3286.68" dur="3.929">hit of cocaine that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="3288.69" dur="3.6">they would do it even if there was no</text>
  <text start="3290.609" dur="3.181">good to come out of it even though it</text>
  <text start="3292.29" dur="2.79">didn&amp;#39;t benefit them in any way it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3293.79" dur="3.36">they just took a helical cane</text>
  <text start="3295.08" dur="5.49">I&amp;#39;m messing you over and exercising</text>
  <text start="3297.15" dur="5.04">their power power corrupts and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3300.57" dur="4.59">because it&amp;#39;s fun at the end of the day</text>
  <text start="3302.19" dur="5.61">it really is it&amp;#39;s rewarding and we have</text>
  <text start="3305.16" dur="4.29">that animal brain still and we we all</text>
  <text start="3307.8" dur="3.72">vie for dominance and things like that</text>
  <text start="3309.45" dur="5.52">so especially people who have kind of</text>
  <text start="3311.52" dur="5.64">weaker egos my bigger fear you know on</text>
  <text start="3314.97" dur="5.85">kind of on top of adding it still goes</text>
  <text start="3317.16" dur="5.97">in but the government is like a flame to</text>
  <text start="3320.82" dur="4.08">the moth for Psychopaths you need any</text>
  <text start="3323.13" dur="3.54">position of authority and power over</text>
  <text start="3324.9" dur="4.59">other people and these are people who</text>
  <text start="3326.67" dur="5.699">have completely no empathy who who seek</text>
  <text start="3329.49" dur="5.369">power as their sole drug of choice in</text>
  <text start="3332.369" dur="2.911">the world because love and empathy and</text>
  <text start="3334.859" dur="3.041">things like that</text>
  <text start="3335.28" dur="4.21">completely far into them</text>
  <text start="3337.9" dur="3.419">they&amp;#39;ll use people and they&amp;#39;re good at</text>
  <text start="3339.49" dur="4.319">that but they don&amp;#39;t really have a lot of</text>
  <text start="3341.319" dur="4.861">compassion for other people they at best</text>
  <text start="3343.809" dur="5.671">there seems to be this elitist culture</text>
  <text start="3346.18" dur="6.57">of if they&amp;#39;re not one of us in the elite</text>
  <text start="3349.48" dur="5.849">level everyone else is a step above a</text>
  <text start="3352.75" dur="5.549">monkey and barely worth you know our</text>
  <text start="3355.329" dur="5.581">attention they are just there to be cogs</text>
  <text start="3358.299" dur="4.381">in the machine and that is an attitude</text>
  <text start="3360.91" dur="3.54">and a culture that we have to also</text>
  <text start="3362.68" dur="3.84">overcome I think it leads to nihilism</text>
  <text start="3364.45" dur="5.78">and it leads to a lot of breakdown in</text>
  <text start="3366.52" dur="6.12">society and it leads to this this</text>
  <text start="3370.23" dur="3.849">depopulation kind of things where they</text>
  <text start="3372.64" dur="3.689">think that they&amp;#39;re doing the right thing</text>
  <text start="3374.079" dur="3.871">by instituting policies that will lead</text>
  <text start="3376.329" dur="4.591">to billions of people dying it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="3377.95" dur="7.08">it&amp;#39;s a sick kind of messed-up world out</text>
  <text start="3380.92" dur="6.3">there at night and which you know would</text>
  <text start="3385.03" dur="4.14">bring me to the last thing that you know</text>
  <text start="3387.22" dur="5.73">I may be not lasting if you have</text>
  <text start="3389.17" dur="7.08">anything else but the you know the idea</text>
  <text start="3392.95" dur="5.639">of standing up and standing firm but you</text>
  <text start="3396.25" dur="5.28">know it&amp;#39;s more necessary now than ever</text>
  <text start="3398.589" dur="5.371">before that we we take a firm stand and</text>
  <text start="3401.53" dur="4.26">I know for myself speaking of my own</text>
  <text start="3403.96" dur="3.83">experience you know I&amp;#39;ve been studying a</text>
  <text start="3405.79" dur="5.13">lot of this stuff for well over a decade</text>
  <text start="3407.79" dur="4.75">and I was a lot of times you know</text>
  <text start="3410.92" dur="3.689">attendez vocal but a lot of times that</text>
  <text start="3412.54" dur="4.259">was kind of a closeted truther right and</text>
  <text start="3414.609" dur="3.151">reserving all that stuff to myself you</text>
  <text start="3416.799" dur="3">know Laura and all stuff like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3417.76" dur="2.849">great cool I&amp;#39;m enlightened but I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3419.799" dur="2.191">doing anything with it and I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3420.609" dur="4.771">actually making a difference in the</text>
  <text start="3421.99" dur="5.19">world with it and so I think largely it</text>
  <text start="3425.38" dur="3.36">comes out of fear and so what I&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="3427.18" dur="3.33">to learn because I&amp;#39;m in a precarious</text>
  <text start="3428.74" dur="4.41">situation where every time that I&amp;#39;m out</text>
  <text start="3430.51" dur="4.319">here presenting I&amp;#39;m talking publicly it</text>
  <text start="3433.15" dur="3.48">can and will be used against me in a</text>
  <text start="3434.829" dur="3.571">court of law because I&amp;#39;m still under</text>
  <text start="3436.63" dur="4.169">charges and I&amp;#39;m gonna be going to court</text>
  <text start="3438.4" dur="4.77">in 2019 and so for me there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3440.799" dur="3.961">tremendous amount of oh it&amp;#39;s a feat</text>
  <text start="3443.17" dur="4.86">whether there should be a trans mount of</text>
  <text start="3444.76" dur="5.579">fear and so I think you know one of the</text>
  <text start="3448.03" dur="4.98">the most important powering thing that</text>
  <text start="3450.339" dur="5.611">I&amp;#39;ve come to discover Islam well not</text>
  <text start="3453.01" dur="5.99">that fear to be pushed out or replaced</text>
  <text start="3455.95" dur="6.869">with love and and so you know for me</text>
  <text start="3459" dur="5.799">it&amp;#39;s taking that bold stand for or the</text>
  <text start="3462.819" dur="5.131">motivating factor for the love of</text>
  <text start="3464.799" dur="6.331">humanity the love of health the love of</text>
  <text start="3467.95" dur="3.39">my other four children and my wife the</text>
  <text start="3471.13" dur="2.07">law</text>
  <text start="3471.34" dur="3.39">the future of my children my</text>
  <text start="3473.2" dur="3.18">grandchildren that you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3474.73" dur="3.81">there has to be a you know a better</text>
  <text start="3476.38" dur="5.85">place for them to grow up in and what I</text>
  <text start="3478.54" dur="6.78">did and so we gotta allow that that love</text>
  <text start="3482.23" dur="5.61">not the anger not the hatred not a fear</text>
  <text start="3485.32" dur="4.95">to motivate us but the love for that</text>
  <text start="3487.84" dur="3.51">which is upright and just to take that</text>
  <text start="3490.27" dur="3.09">firm stand</text>
  <text start="3491.35" dur="5.24">otherwise we&amp;#39;ll find ourselves crippled</text>
  <text start="3493.36" dur="5.94">through that fear or burnt-out and so</text>
  <text start="3496.59" dur="4.5">more important now than ever to make</text>
  <text start="3499.3" dur="4.41">sure that we take that stand because</text>
  <text start="3501.09" dur="5.53">there is so much so much corruption</text>
  <text start="3503.71" dur="4.47">going on on so many levels well above</text>
  <text start="3506.62" dur="3.96">and beyond what we what we discussed</text>
  <text start="3508.18" dur="6.66">today obviously I&amp;#39;m sure its cover often</text>
  <text start="3510.58" dur="6.03">so time ticks down I can relate with</text>
  <text start="3514.84" dur="4.14">with what you said there cuz for a long</text>
  <text start="3516.61" dur="4.68">time I was I call it the red pill</text>
  <text start="3518.98" dur="4.44">isolation but I was basically a loner</text>
  <text start="3521.29" dur="4.11">and then I felt alone in the world and</text>
  <text start="3523.42" dur="4.82">just like how do I help people with this</text>
  <text start="3525.4" dur="5.43">information no one wants to hear it um</text>
  <text start="3528.24" dur="4.66">brother I really appreciate your time</text>
  <text start="3530.83" dur="3.63">and I think you for coming on the show</text>

  <text start="3534.46" dur="4.8">case I mean there is something to say</text>
  <text start="3537.49" dur="4.2">about love conquers all I mean it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="3539.26" dur="4.08">of an old trope but they&amp;#39;re the only</text>
  <text start="3541.69" dur="3.78">thing more powerful than the organized</text>
  <text start="3543.34" dur="3.33">psychopath cabal that run this world it</text>
  <text start="3545.47" dur="3.27">let&amp;#39;s be honest they at the highest</text>
  <text start="3546.67" dur="3.72">levels they&amp;#39;re all Psychopaths the only</text>
  <text start="3548.74" dur="5.19">thing more powerful than them crushing</text>
  <text start="3550.39" dur="5.79">us down is the love that we feel for our</text>
  <text start="3553.93" dur="3.39">fellow man and our children and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3556.18" dur="2.82">the only thing that&amp;#39;s going to give us</text>
  <text start="3557.32" dur="2.91">the strength that we need to endure all</text>
  <text start="3559" dur="3.93">of the suffering that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3560.23" dur="4.92">put us through for fighting back and I</text>
  <text start="3562.93" dur="4.47">think we need more dads like you out</text>

  <text start="3574.87" dur="3.33">never been a better time for people to</text>
  <text start="3576.31" dur="4.17">stand up because the MSM media are</text>
  <text start="3578.2" dur="3.99">completely exposed I mean no one really</text>
  <text start="3580.48" dur="5.94">trusts them anymore except for the very</text>
  <text start="3582.19" dur="6.63">fringe so more than ever the MSM have</text>
  <text start="3586.42" dur="4.35">lost their ability to control the</text>
  <text start="3588.82" dur="5.28">narrative it&amp;#39;s an opportunity for</text>
  <text start="3590.77" dur="5.07">everyone to stand up in mass absolutely</text>
