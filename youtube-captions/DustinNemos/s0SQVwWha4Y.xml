  <text start="43.789" dur="5.441">constitutional scholars supposedly and</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="4.83">someone here has cropped on the pink</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="5.28">pussy hat of the left kind of that</text>
  <text start="52.02" dur="6.42">woman&amp;#39;s hate group I guess anti-trump</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="6.93">purse and frankly it fits she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="5.19">basically is just an angry leftist who</text>
  <text start="61.44" dur="3.81">wants to hurt Trump and even went after</text>
  <text start="63.63" dur="3.75">his son at one point with a snide remark</text>
  <text start="65.25" dur="3.81">trying to implicate that Trump wants to</text>
  <text start="67.38" dur="3.36">be a king and therefore named his son</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="3.57">Baron but couldn&amp;#39;t make him a bear and</text>
  <text start="70.74" dur="4.199">it really wasn&amp;#39;t even that funny of a</text>
  <text start="72.63" dur="5.19">joke my cat&amp;#39;s outside the window looking</text>
  <text start="74.939" dur="5.97">at me like a creeper anyway</text>
  <text start="77.82" dur="5.579">he does that sometimes so in a shoe of</text>
  <text start="80.909" dur="5.28">course she&amp;#39;s also a donator of money to</text>
  <text start="83.399" dur="6.39">I think also Obama but at least Clinton</text>
  <text start="86.189" dur="6">and you know this is not a shock either</text>
  <text start="89.789" dur="4.591">she&amp;#39;s clearly an anti romper was a</text>
  <text start="92.189" dur="5.07">potential SCOTUS nominee pick for</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="5.909">Clinton&amp;#39;s lists so she had a lot to gain</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="6.39">from a Clinton when herself and is</text>
  <text start="100.289" dur="6.631">certainly biased and it gets even more</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="5.07">weird than that and who not surprised</text>
  <text start="106.92" dur="3.57">that they might call in some lefty</text>
  <text start="108.719" dur="3.69">people in positions of power because</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="4.379">they always you know have have their own</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="3.87">group in group reference in mind when</text>
  <text start="114.869" dur="3.441">when handing out those positions of</text>
  <text start="116.279" dur="4.26">power and then they stack that certain</text>
  <text start="118.31" dur="5.469">systems like the educational system</text>
  <text start="120.539" dur="4.94">basically 90% liberal right so so</text>
  <text start="123.779" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;ll bring in their their</text>
  <text start="125.479" dur="5.76">authoritative figures to try to circular</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="4.56">logic you and and try to build circular</text>
  <text start="131.239" dur="3.731">credibility just like you had talked</text>
  <text start="133.349" dur="3.871">about in a recent post if you guys</text>
  <text start="134.97" dur="3.989">remember that and that&amp;#39;s how they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="3.57">been building up the credibility for</text>
  <text start="138.959" dur="4.531">different scams such as global warming</text>
  <text start="140.79" dur="5.14">and stuff anyway so they&amp;#39;ve done that</text>
  <text start="143.49" dur="5.71">with a lot of their</text>
  <text start="145.93" dur="5.22">posing constitutional law scholars right</text>
  <text start="149.2" dur="4.17">and they would come in there and then</text>
  <text start="151.15" dur="4.679">argue anti-constitutional things now one</text>
  <text start="153.37" dur="4.619">of them even kind of told it point-blank</text>
  <text start="155.829" dur="3.811">in a pro Trump way and even told the</text>
  <text start="157.989" dur="3">committee that you guys are abusing your</text>
  <text start="159.64" dur="4.29">power and if you do this and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.989" dur="4.771">wrong and we&amp;#39;ll get to that but I also</text>
  <text start="163.93" dur="4.44">want to go into something that really</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="4.289">crazy that happened here now Schiff of</text>
  <text start="168.37" dur="3.869">course has been breaking all sorts of</text>
  <text start="170.049" dur="3.481">laws and he can&amp;#39;t be arrested or held</text>
  <text start="172.239" dur="4.47">accountable because of certain</text>
  <text start="173.53" dur="6.989">immunities granted to the house but he</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="6.48">has been also outright spying on not</text>
  <text start="180.519" dur="6.33">only Rudy Giuliani president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.189" dur="5.91">attorney but also Devin Nunez and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.849" dur="4.56">this is just getting crazy I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="189.099" dur="3.75">just over third world nation kind of</text>
  <text start="191.409" dur="3.42">stuff now of course it always happens</text>
  <text start="192.849" dur="3.51">and and we know that that&amp;#39;s how politics</text>
  <text start="194.829" dur="6.601">work you you try to get dirt on people</text>
  <text start="196.359" dur="7.77">but to see the to see it weaponized in</text>
  <text start="201.43" dur="4.919">this way it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pretty wild and he</text>
  <text start="204.129" dur="5.911">subpoenaed these records directly from</text>
  <text start="206.349" dur="6.75">the phone companies and that&amp;#39;s just and</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="5.309">the fact that they actually accept it</text>
  <text start="213.099" dur="6.72">just gave up the records like that</text>
  <text start="215.349" dur="8.941">pretty wild and Rudy Giuliani even</text>
  <text start="219.819" dur="6.06">responded to that where they had spied</text>
  <text start="224.29" dur="3.689">on his phone records and he says here</text>
  <text start="225.879" dur="4.651">the mere fact I had numerous calls with</text>
  <text start="227.979" dur="4.201">the White House does not establish any</text>
  <text start="230.53" dur="3.419">specific topic remember I&amp;#39;m the</text>
  <text start="232.18" dur="3.75">president&amp;#39;s attorney they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="233.949" dur="4.081">taken away Donald real Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.93" dur="4.11">rights to call witnesses cross-examined</text>
  <text start="238.03" dur="4.859">confront his accusers or be represented</text>
  <text start="240.04" dur="4.909">by counsel at hearings now he can&amp;#39;t talk</text>
  <text start="242.889" dur="5.43">to his counsel on the telephone</text>
  <text start="244.949" dur="8.22">this is CNN&amp;#39;s version of America coming</text>
  <text start="248.319" dur="7.38">to a theater near you now is this is</text>
  <text start="253.169" dur="4.421">pretty point to the points I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="255.699" dur="4.741">really have much to add to that but the</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="4.29">fact that they are even trying to pull</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="3.3">things like this off right now and</text>
  <text start="261.88" dur="4.92">point-blank in front of everyone just</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="4.89">shows how much brazenness they think</text>
  <text start="266.8" dur="3.51">that they have by controlling the</text>
  <text start="268.63" dur="3.15">narrative on the internet and think that</text>
  <text start="270.31" dur="2.76">they think that they got kind of get</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="2.85">away with it and they think that they</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="3.959">have the fake news in their pocket and</text>
  <text start="274.63" dur="3.93">therefore you know no one&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="277.029" dur="2.14">able to challenge their lies and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.56" dur="2.229">gonna</text>
  <text start="279.169" dur="3.661">in the dead of night and have a</text>
  <text start="280.789" dur="3.75">Christmas impeachment when everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="3.449">gone home to be with their families for</text>
  <text start="284.539" dur="4.021">Christmas just like they did with the</text>
  <text start="286.279" dur="5.22">1913 Federal Reserve Act it&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="4.979">repeat of that except that Patriots this</text>
  <text start="291.499" dur="5.551">time are aware and they will stop it</text>
  <text start="293.539" dur="5.671">so of course you know not surprised to</text>
  <text start="297.05" dur="5.519">see Giuliani fighting back and then of</text>
  <text start="299.21" dur="5.1">course Nunez who is of course also</text>
  <text start="302.569" dur="4.231">having his phone records spied on while</text>
  <text start="304.31" dur="4.02">he sits right next to two chef&amp;#39;s in some</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="3.81">of these hearings and he won&amp;#39;t even make</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="3.959">eye contact it looks like half the time</text>
  <text start="310.61" dur="4.649">because he&amp;#39;s probably just disgusted</text>
  <text start="312.289" dur="5.37">with chef who&amp;#39;s an overt liar and has</text>
  <text start="315.259" dur="4.891">all these potential links to pedophilia</text>
  <text start="317.659" dur="5.31">and even a murder and his background and</text>
  <text start="320.15" dur="4.41">a cover-up so there&amp;#39;s a lot of a reason</text>
  <text start="322.969" dur="3.391">for him to be very nervous and to hate</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="5.43">President Trump and to try to take him</text>
  <text start="326.36" dur="7.169">down before this corruption is exposed</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="5.669">this anti-corruption president so you</text>
  <text start="333.529" dur="4.23">know the whole swamp hates the one man</text>
  <text start="335.659" dur="5.31">who&amp;#39;s walking through with the mud proof</text>
  <text start="337.759" dur="5.34">boots and that&amp;#39;s our president they</text>
  <text start="340.969" dur="5.341">can&amp;#39;t find anything to stick to this man</text>
  <text start="343.099" dur="6.66">and he&amp;#39;s surrounded by swamp nothing</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="4.919">sticks now we also have that happening</text>
  <text start="349.759" dur="3.66">and the fact that they&amp;#39;re gonna try to</text>
  <text start="351.229" dur="4.11">use this impeachment inquiry to do so</text>
  <text start="353.419" dur="4.49">and to try to spy on the other people</text>
  <text start="355.339" dur="7.17">involved in it is also just very</text>
  <text start="357.909" dur="8.921">Orwellian and very concerning and then</text>
  <text start="362.509" dur="6.75">of course we also have a goal shift</text>
  <text start="366.83" dur="5.22">going after Giuliani&amp;#39;s phone records</text>
  <text start="369.259" dur="5.13">a day after attorney general bar in the</text>
  <text start="372.05" dur="4.079">US attorney Durham you know two big</text>
  <text start="374.389" dur="3.75">names and very prominent and the whole</text>
  <text start="376.129" dur="3.51">justice phase aspect of the queuing on</text>
  <text start="378.139" dur="2.941">movement and some of the predictions</text>
  <text start="379.639" dur="2.881">that have been made there that that</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="3.03">arrests would happen and we would see</text>
  <text start="382.52" dur="3.299">sort of some treason trials and things</text>
  <text start="384.11" dur="3.6">of that nature high level stuff high</text>
  <text start="385.819" dur="4.741">level players all the way up to Obama</text>
  <text start="387.71" dur="3.81">possibly and you know for those who</text>
  <text start="390.56" dur="2.49">don&amp;#39;t know already</text>
  <text start="391.52" dur="5.819">Guantanamo Bay has been drastically</text>
  <text start="393.05" dur="7.56">expanded both and buildings and funding</text>
  <text start="397.339" dur="7.86">and supplies in acquisitions and</text>
  <text start="400.61" dur="7.68">requisitions in troops stationed there</text>
  <text start="405.199" dur="6.181">it&amp;#39;s expanded in a big way for</text>
  <text start="408.29" dur="5.7">some pretty big-name people I think so</text>
  <text start="411.38" dur="6.99">we also have him going after those phone</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="7.95">records of Giuliani right after those</text>
  <text start="418.37" dur="5.61">two went to Rome of course to look into</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="4.71">the corruption going on with like Mifsud</text>
  <text start="423.98" dur="4.41">and others now that means they&amp;#39;re hot on</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="4.95">the trail of the deep state with the</text>
  <text start="428.39" dur="5.07">whole FISA gate situation and and the</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="3.9">coming disclosures that are coming leer</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="5.1">with the reports coming out and then</text>
  <text start="435.5" dur="4.5">also the five eyes and the intelligence</text>
  <text start="438.56" dur="3.15">community kind of weaponizing the</text>
  <text start="440" dur="3.39">worldwide five eyes intelligence</text>
  <text start="441.71" dur="4.41">community to spy on President Trump and</text>
  <text start="443.39" dur="5.04">others as well so there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="4.77">moving pieces to this that they have to</text>
  <text start="448.43" dur="5.04">go and hunt down and and prove in a</text>
  <text start="450.89" dur="5.76">court case coming soon where we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="453.47" dur="5.67">have some trials for treason I hope now</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="5.7">we also have Matt gates blasting the</text>
  <text start="459.14" dur="6.09">radical far left crazy professor after</text>
  <text start="462.35" dur="4.74">she attacks president Trump&amp;#39;s son and</text>
  <text start="465.23" dur="5.37">this was pretty good I want you guys to</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="7.609">see it check it out remember saying the</text>
  <text start="470.6" dur="6.589">following liberals tend to cluster more</text>
  <text start="474.699" dur="5.101">remember saying the following liberals</text>
  <text start="477.189" dur="5.371">tend to cluster more conservatives</text>
  <text start="479.8" dur="5.519">especially very conservative people tend</text>
  <text start="482.56" dur="4.59">to spread out more perhaps because they</text>
  <text start="485.319" dur="5.611">don&amp;#39;t even want to be around themselves</text>
  <text start="487.15" dur="6.989">did you say that yes I did do you</text>
  <text start="490.93" dur="5.25">understand how that reflects contempt on</text>
  <text start="494.139" dur="5.191">people who are conservative know what I</text>
  <text start="496.18" dur="5.37">was talking about there was the natural</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="5.269">tendency if you put the quote in context</text>
  <text start="501.55" dur="7.919">the natural tendency of a compactness</text>
  <text start="504.599" dur="12.19">requirement to favor a party whose</text>
  <text start="509.469" dur="9.151">voters are more spread out well and so I</text>
  <text start="516.789" dur="3.391">just have to say when you talk about how</text>
  <text start="518.62" dur="3.57">liberals want to be around each other in</text>
  <text start="520.18" dur="3.18">cluster and conservatives don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="522.19" dur="3.36">be around each other and so they have to</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="3.99">spread out it makes people you may not</text>
  <text start="525.55" dur="3.99">see this from you know like the ivory</text>
  <text start="527.35" dur="5.52">towers of your law school but it makes</text>
  <text start="529.54" dur="5.19">actual people in this country well get</text>
  <text start="532.87" dur="4.29">to interrupt me on this time now let me</text>
  <text start="534.73" dur="4.56">also suggest that when you invoke the</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="3.96">president&amp;#39;s son&amp;#39;s name here here when</text>
  <text start="539.29" dur="3.93">you try to make a little joke out of</text>

  <text start="566.5" dur="3.449">a single fact and you know what that</text>
  <text start="568.18" dur="4.019">continues on the tradition that we saw</text>
  <text start="569.949" dur="3.901">from Adam Schiff where ambassador Taylor</text>
