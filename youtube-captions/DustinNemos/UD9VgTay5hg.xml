  <text start="14.73" dur="6.34">welcome back my friends so I&amp;#39;ve had some</text>
  <text start="17.47" dur="6.27">requests for trying to explain how</text>
  <text start="21.07" dur="3.93">blockchain works so bear with me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="23.74" dur="3.749">gonna do my best here</text>
  <text start="25" dur="5.849">I am NOT what you would consider to be a</text>
  <text start="27.489" dur="6.631">technical person that said I grew up on</text>
  <text start="30.849" dur="5.46">the Internet I from basically mid-teens</text>
  <text start="34.12" dur="4.53">got my first computer and then I threw</text>
  <text start="36.309" dur="3.901">away my old Nintendo 64 and I never</text>
  <text start="38.65" dur="4.29">looked back to consoles and you know I</text>
  <text start="40.21" dur="4.14">grew up as if as a gamer obviously</text>
  <text start="42.94" dur="4.049">didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of friends when I was</text>
  <text start="44.35" dur="4.62">growing up because I&amp;#39;m kind of out there</text>
  <text start="46.989" dur="4.231">in eccentric I mean I&amp;#39;m into stuff like</text>
  <text start="48.97" dur="5.04">this and as many of you already know it</text>
  <text start="51.22" dur="6.089">can be kind of lonely most people are</text>
  <text start="54.01" dur="6.149">not into this these kind of topics so as</text>
  <text start="57.309" dur="4.021">soon as you start talking about poison</text>
  <text start="60.159" dur="3.481">in the water and they&amp;#39;re trying to kill</text>
  <text start="61.33" dur="5.91">us with GMOs you tend to not make as</text>
  <text start="63.64" dur="5.61">many friends I said I am kind of a loner</text>
  <text start="67.24" dur="4.26">anyway so the video game life was great</text>
  <text start="69.25" dur="3.45">for me so I grew up on the Internet I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="71.5" dur="4.29">pretty comfortable with getting rid of</text>
  <text start="72.7" dur="5.16">viruses and pretty comfortable with most</text>
  <text start="75.79" dur="3.6">software I&amp;#39;m not great with building a</text>
  <text start="77.86" dur="5.48">computer or anything else I&amp;#39;m not like</text>
  <text start="79.39" dur="6.48">super nerd I&amp;#39;m not like Geek Squad but</text>
  <text start="83.34" dur="4.21">I&amp;#39;m gonna do my best to break this down</text>
  <text start="85.87" dur="6.72">because it is kind of a complicated</text>
  <text start="87.55" dur="7.14">topic the blockchain as they call it but</text>
  <text start="92.59" dur="5.46">to understand the blockchain you have to</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="5.61">understand a ledger okay now a ledger is</text>
  <text start="98.05" dur="5.94">like in the old movies where you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="100.3" dur="5.19">the clerk or like a Scrooge type and</text>
  <text start="103.99" dur="4.32">they have this little leather-bound</text>
  <text start="105.49" dur="4.38">journal and in it they&amp;#39;re keeping up</text>
  <text start="108.31" dur="4.11">with all of their business numbers and</text>
  <text start="109.87" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s basically we paid this for this we</text>
  <text start="112.42" dur="3.3">paid this for this you know just like a</text>
  <text start="114.13" dur="4.41">spreadsheet but before they had</text>
  <text start="115.72" dur="5.97">computers and you would he would record</text>
  <text start="118.54" dur="6">what you paid who it was - how much what</text>
  <text start="121.69" dur="4.859">the date was kind of just the basics of</text>
  <text start="124.54" dur="3.93">a transaction everybody understands a</text>
  <text start="126.549" dur="3.871">ledger they just many of us in these</text>
  <text start="128.47" dur="5.129">days don&amp;#39;t remember the word because you</text>
  <text start="130.42" dur="5.58">no one ever uses it anymore so you have</text>
  <text start="133.599" dur="6.241">your spreadsheet ledger thing all right</text>
  <text start="136" dur="6.959">and blockchain is what&amp;#39;s considered a</text>
  <text start="139.84" dur="5.7">distributed ledger technology so what</text>
  <text start="142.959" dur="6.331">that means is you have ten</text>
  <text start="145.54" dur="6.69">clerks in a room and they&amp;#39;re all writing</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="6.33">their transactions like I sold this to</text>
  <text start="152.23" dur="6.81">Bob and you know Sally sold this to me</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="7.649">or or I bought this from blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="7.619">so each of them every hour they meet up</text>
  <text start="163.269" dur="5.011">and they compare notes and then they</text>
  <text start="166.659" dur="3.151">record each other&amp;#39;s transactions too</text>
  <text start="168.28" dur="5.73">they have a separate page for each</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="8.579">person and by doing that they all have</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="6.149">an exact copy of their own even down to</text>
  <text start="178.389" dur="4.8">the handwriting it&amp;#39;s perfectly the same</text>
  <text start="180.159" dur="4.86">they basically just Xerox copy of each</text>
  <text start="183.189" dur="7.741">other&amp;#39;s notes and then they all have a</text>
  <text start="185.019" dur="7.53">copy now the concern or the the fear</text>
  <text start="190.93" dur="5.429">that people who don&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="192.549" dur="6.75">blockchain have is is twofold can it be</text>
  <text start="196.359" dur="6.541">manipulated by like a government to</text>
  <text start="199.299" dur="8.64">control what we see or can it be happen</text>
  <text start="202.9" dur="6.66">to and my money stolen from me now what</text>
  <text start="207.939" dur="4.38">would have to happen for that to work</text>
  <text start="209.56" dur="5.669">mathematically speaking is that one of</text>
  <text start="212.319" dur="4.89">those ten people would would have to</text>
  <text start="215.229" dur="4.201">well it wouldn&amp;#39;t even work but they</text>
  <text start="217.209" dur="3.78">would have to start trying to to cheat</text>
  <text start="219.43" dur="4.019">they would start changing numbers around</text>
  <text start="220.989" dur="4.951">they would start editing things right</text>
  <text start="223.449" dur="5.1">well as soon as those ten people go meet</text>
  <text start="225.94" dur="4.229">up again and they compare notes the</text>
  <text start="228.549" dur="3.81">other nine are gonna realize hey dude</text>
  <text start="230.169" dur="6.391">something&amp;#39;s wrong with your notes fix</text>
  <text start="232.359" dur="6.12">that so the only way theoretically that</text>
  <text start="236.56" dur="5.609">he could actually hack into the</text>
  <text start="238.479" dur="5.671">blockchain to manipulate it is if you</text>
  <text start="242.169" dur="3.841">had the majority of those votes if you</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="4.86">had already gotten like six or seven of</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="7.259">those people all of them working</text>
  <text start="249.01" dur="6">together seeing the exact same lie would</text>
  <text start="253.269" dur="5.58">then overrule the others because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.01" dur="5.55">sort of a consensus algorithm that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.849" dur="6.181">kind of how it works with blockchain</text>
  <text start="260.56" dur="7.74">times Millions all of the computers that</text>
  <text start="265.03" dur="6.229">run these things compare notes every</text>
  <text start="268.3" dur="2.959">couple seconds and</text>
  <text start="272.12" dur="6.15">reject any kind of manipulation or lie</text>
  <text start="275.27" dur="7.27">so you always have a consensus driven</text>
  <text start="278.27" dur="5.89">round table peer-to-peer there&amp;#39;s no no</text>
  <text start="282.54" dur="5.19">one can go in and manipulate it or</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="7.05">change it or print more or steal like</text>
  <text start="287.73" dur="5.01">that there are you can absolutely steal</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="3">Bitcoin from people there are hackers</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="2.82">that can get a keylogger on your</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="3.12">computer you should get an ant if you</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="3.51">have a lot of money and you leave it on</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="6.54">your computer you should get an anti key</text>
  <text start="299.07" dur="7.5">logger program not just a antivirus it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="4.74">better to store it offline for example</text>
  <text start="306.57" dur="4.5">on a laptop that never touches the</text>
  <text start="308.61" dur="5.1">internet or on a hardware wallet which</text>
  <text start="311.07" dur="6.51">is kind of like a flash drive but for</text>
  <text start="313.71" dur="5.58">your Bitcoin or crypto there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="3.03">options to be safe about it but</text>
  <text start="319.29" dur="3.27">theoretically they can happen to your</text>
  <text start="320.61" dur="3.51">computer and still your Bitcoin and have</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="3.21">your computer send it to someone else</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="4.98">and that would not the blockchain</text>
  <text start="325.77" dur="6.39">wouldn&amp;#39;t help you but as far as hacking</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="4.53">into the system this is the most secure</text>
  <text start="332.16" dur="3.33">system on the planet now they&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="6.66">them in Portia&amp;#39;s blockchain is it now in</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="6.6">Portia&amp;#39;s so understand that even though</text>
  <text start="340.29" dur="3.44">it&amp;#39;s new and it&amp;#39;s scary and most people</text>
  <text start="342.09" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t understand yeah and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="343.73" dur="5.71">widely used we&amp;#39;re in that we&amp;#39;re in that</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="4.56">face we&amp;#39;re going from like 1% to 3% of</text>
  <text start="349.44" dur="4.02">the population that really early adopter</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="4.92">phase and those are the people like the</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="3.96">first 1% the first 2 3 % there those are</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="2.61">the people are gonna make the most money</text>
  <text start="357.42" dur="2.97">the millions of dollars you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.89" dur="4.23">the ones that bought it at a penny and</text>
  <text start="360.39" dur="4.65">then they got to $18,000 or they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="363.12" dur="4.11">ones that bought it at $18,000 and then</text>
  <text start="365.04" dur="3.27">theoretically I I have complete</text>
  <text start="367.23" dur="3.09">confidence and it&amp;#39;s gonna go to a</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="6.78">hundred thousand dollars if not Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="370.32" dur="5.76">something will so and that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="2.22">you have to buy a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="3.06">dollars or if you can buy a Penny&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.31" dur="3.51">worth because you can just go down to</text>
  <text start="379.14" dur="3.78">point zero zero zoos or whatever</text>
  <text start="380.82" dur="3.48">okay that&amp;#39;s a neat thing about it is</text>
  <text start="382.92" dur="5.76">they&amp;#39;re called Satoshi&amp;#39;s this little</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="6.71">point percentages at least with Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="6.71">they&amp;#39;re called Satoshi&amp;#39;s based on the</text>
  <text start="391.01" dur="6.66">the creator Satoshi so</text>
  <text start="395.39" dur="5.07">to break into this system you would have</text>
  <text start="397.67" dur="6.21">to hack most of the internet most of the</text>
  <text start="400.46" dur="6.09">world at once theoretically it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.88" dur="4.41">possible to theoretically some space</text>
  <text start="406.55" dur="4.08">aliens with hyper advanced technology</text>
  <text start="408.29" dur="5.76">could come and virus us all up and and</text>
  <text start="410.63" dur="5.7">everything but practically it&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="414.05" dur="4.43">been done never even been close to being</text>
  <text start="416.33" dur="2.15">done</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="6.01">you know so nothing&amp;#39;s perfect but it you</text>
  <text start="423.5" dur="4.68">know this is a this is this is one of</text>
  <text start="425.69" dur="5.67">those like theoretical fears it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="428.18" dur="7.86">it&amp;#39;s not really that much of a concern</text>
  <text start="431.36" dur="6.63">for those who are using the stuff so you</text>
  <text start="436.04" dur="4.71">have this this round table and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="437.99" dur="5.58">compare that to money dollar money fiat</text>
  <text start="440.75" dur="5.88">currency money euros of whatever rubles</text>
  <text start="443.57" dur="5.79">whatever you want to use these are</text>
  <text start="446.63" dur="4.2">pretty much all paper fiat currencies</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="4.25">issued by central banks which are</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="4.98">private central banks for-profit</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="4.84">basically all of the money that you pay</text>
  <text start="455.81" dur="4.68">and in taxes on your income tax for</text>
  <text start="458.45" dur="3.18">example goes to the central bank the</text>
  <text start="460.49" dur="3.48">Federal Reserve doesn&amp;#39;t go to the</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="6.75">government they&amp;#39;re not the same goes to</text>
  <text start="463.97" dur="7.59">the Rothschilds so please don&amp;#39;t comment</text>
  <text start="468.38" dur="4.77">saying that that Kryptos are scams if</text>
  <text start="471.56" dur="6.66">you still use dollars because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.15" dur="7.32">hypocritical dollars by the Rothschild</text>
  <text start="478.22" dur="4.92">family and other big banking families</text>
  <text start="480.47" dur="4.35">can be printed it will as you&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="483.14" dur="5.22">with quantitative easing and then our</text>
  <text start="484.82" dur="5.64">debt has done this number okay we have</text>
  <text start="488.36" dur="3.54">like 200 trillion dollars and unfunded</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="3">liabilities we cannot even</text>
  <text start="491.9" dur="5.43">mathematically pay it back it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.46" dur="5.4">impossible and you can&amp;#39;t you can never</text>
  <text start="497.33" dur="3.03">get rid of debt with this system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.86" dur="3.81">actually based in debt because every</text>
  <text start="500.36" dur="4.05">dollar printed comes with a debt</text>
  <text start="502.67" dur="3.51">attached to it so if you paid back if</text>
  <text start="504.41" dur="3.6">every single person just gave up all of</text>
  <text start="506.18" dur="3.69">their money and paid back everything and</text>
  <text start="508.01" dur="3.72">all they&amp;#39;re all there were no dollars</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="3.96">left they had them all back we would</text>
  <text start="511.73" dur="5.22">still owe like a quarter of what we had</text>
  <text start="513.83" dur="6.14">put back in so you cannot pay it back</text>
  <text start="516.95" dur="5.75">it&amp;#39;s a debt based slavery money</text>
  <text start="519.97" dur="4.8">and you know they can they can play with</text>
  <text start="522.7" dur="4.23">interest rates create boom and bust</text>
  <text start="524.77" dur="4.41">cycles and that&amp;#39;s what they historically</text>
  <text start="526.93" dur="3.99">do it&amp;#39;s like fleecing sheep they will</text>
  <text start="529.18" dur="4.5">they will play with interest rates</text>
  <text start="530.92" dur="5.22">create a boom they&amp;#39;ll sell out all their</text>
  <text start="533.68" dur="5.31">assets and they&amp;#39;ll get all this all this</text>
  <text start="536.14" dur="7.02">wealth and then they&amp;#39;ll create a bust</text>
  <text start="538.99" dur="7.35">which everybody goes into a depression</text>
  <text start="543.16" dur="5.13">mode and asset prices go way down and</text>
  <text start="546.34" dur="4.29">then they just buy it all up and then</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="6.3">they boom it up again this is how you</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="5.99">this is how you farm humans folks we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.59" dur="5.91">all familiar with the concept of animals</text>
  <text start="556.62" dur="6.22">you know being farmed for for productive</text>
  <text start="560.5" dur="4.19">profit you know you you may have sheep</text>
  <text start="562.84" dur="6.75">then you share them and make to make</text>
  <text start="564.69" dur="6.97">fabric you may have you know a herd of</text>
  <text start="569.59" dur="5.01">meat animals that you you take from</text>
  <text start="571.66" dur="5.43">every so often and then the herd you may</text>
  <text start="574.6" dur="3.89">have chickens that give you eggs and you</text>
  <text start="577.09" dur="3.09">eat some of the Roosters sometimes</text>
  <text start="578.49" dur="10">because otherwise they&amp;#39;ll kill each</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="10.32">other this is how you farm humans you</text>
  <text start="588.49" dur="4.23">make a complicated math situation then</text>
  <text start="590.5" dur="4.71">you make it difficult to resist too much</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="4.08">for people to want to look into its make</text>
  <text start="595.21" dur="7.2">it seem like it&amp;#39;s too hard it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="596.8" dur="7.86">not that difficult so you have all of</text>
  <text start="602.41" dur="5.04">these these corrupt practices and it</text>
  <text start="604.66" dur="5.31">innit that system is shaped like a</text>
  <text start="607.45" dur="5.31">pyramid there&amp;#39;s people at the top of the</text>
  <text start="609.97" dur="4.53">pyramid manipulating all the strings and</text>
  <text start="612.76" dur="3.5">affecting everyone down below them that</text>
  <text start="614.5" dur="4.4">is impossible</text>
  <text start="616.26" dur="4.57">outside of the theoretical that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.9" dur="5.05">effectively that&amp;#39;s impossible with</text>
  <text start="620.83" dur="5.94">cryptocurrencies now it&amp;#39;s important to</text>
  <text start="623.95" dur="5.75">distinguish because some kryptos are our</text>
  <text start="626.77" dur="5.28">newer kryptos and they have basically</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="3.91">bankster backing like the ripple coin</text>
  <text start="632.05" dur="5.85">which is one of the most popular coins</text>
  <text start="633.61" dur="6.48">now is not a decentralized bitcoin style</text>
  <text start="637.9" dur="4.05">cryptocurrency it is a banksters</text>

  <text start="984.26" dur="4.53">the big thing is that it&amp;#39;s manipulated</text>
  <text start="986.48" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s also difficult to trade with and</text>
  <text start="988.79" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s difficult to especially</text>

  <text start="1937.93" dur="6.48">that perceived value is going to be lost</text>
  <text start="1941.76" dur="4.54">about the same portion that the cryptos</text>
  <text start="1944.41" dur="3.99">are going to be gained and gold and</text>
  <text start="1946.3" dur="3.81">silver is gonna benefit as well but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1948.4" dur="4.58">still manipulated we don&amp;#39;t know when and</text>
