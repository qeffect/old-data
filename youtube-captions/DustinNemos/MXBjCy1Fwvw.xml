  <text start="6.12" dur="3.059">by a very exciting guest dr. Judy</text>
  <text start="8.61" dur="2.1">Markovitz</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="4.021">and I&amp;#39;m gonna give you a little bit</text>
  <text start="10.71" dur="5.37">about her resume but first how I how I</text>
  <text start="13.2" dur="4.71">came across her so you guys know I was I</text>
  <text start="16.08" dur="4.74">was invited to speak at the autism one</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="4.529">conference and I the person who invited</text>
  <text start="20.82" dur="2.73">me their name is Candace I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="22.439" dur="3.961">she wants me to give her a real name now</text>
  <text start="23.55" dur="5.25">but she actually connected me to dr.</text>
  <text start="26.4" dur="5.43">Judy who has done a lot of work I mean</text>
  <text start="28.8" dur="5.43">she is molecular biologist</text>
  <text start="31.83" dur="5.36">okay so way smarter than any of us with</text>
  <text start="34.23" dur="5.66">essentially four decades of experience</text>
  <text start="37.19" dur="4.779">researching into aids and cancer</text>
  <text start="39.89" dur="4.3">understanding then the real natural</text>
  <text start="41.969" dur="3.121">medicine versus the you know the system</text>
  <text start="44.19" dur="3.09">that we&amp;#39;re dealing with today</text>
  <text start="45.09" dur="5.07">so dr. Judy how are you doing and thank</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="5.58">you for making the time I&amp;#39;m doing pretty</text>
  <text start="50.16" dur="4.739">well right now and actually coming to</text>
  <text start="52.86" dur="4.71">you from Frederick Memorial Hospital</text>
  <text start="54.899" dur="4.91">where my mom was hospitalized about a</text>
  <text start="57.57" dur="5.61">week ago with a bowel obstruction that</text>
  <text start="59.809" dur="6.281">that until today we thought was a</text>
  <text start="63.18" dur="5.88">massive tumor and it turned out the</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="5.25">tumor wasn&amp;#39;t malignant there is some</text>
  <text start="69.06" dur="5.07">cancer there but I think I can use and</text>
  <text start="71.34" dur="4.8">have talked with the oncologist there so</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="7.68">now I can use the natural medicines we</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="6.839">developed to heal my own mother huh you</text>
  <text start="81.81" dur="3.989">know that&amp;#39;s interesting because I came</text>
  <text start="82.979" dur="4.441">across this the idea that cancer can be</text>
  <text start="85.799" dur="4.201">dealt with naturally when I was trying</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="4.44">to help my grandfather years ago and he</text>
  <text start="90" dur="4.38">never listened to me so unfortunately he</text>
  <text start="91.86" dur="5.52">passed away but you know on a personal</text>
  <text start="94.38" dur="6.68">note how how does it feel or how does it</text>
  <text start="97.38" dur="5.309">work dealing with the typical medical</text>
  <text start="101.06" dur="3.699">professionals who are usually very</text>
  <text start="102.689" dur="3.811">against this kind of thing from your</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="3.54">perspective who you know you know this</text>
  <text start="106.5" dur="3.149">like the back of your hand so it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="2.85">to be a little different when they when</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="4.771">they try to talk down to you about that</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="5.281">well I got into this um trying to help</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="5.19">my own grandfather when I was 10 years</text>
  <text start="116.43" dur="6.24">old I&amp;#39;m now 60 so it&amp;#39;s been quite a</text>
  <text start="119.61" dur="7.049">journey of you know 50 years since then</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="5.58">and I didn&amp;#39;t have any more luck with you</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="4.05">know my stepfather there was so many</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="5.64">friends and family that died because the</text>
  <text start="130.709" dur="6.481">medical establishment is really big</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="5.76">resistant to thinking about alternative</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="5.97">strategies to support the immune system</text>
  <text start="139.65" dur="5.19">and heal from and avoid the drugs and</text>
  <text start="143.16" dur="6.96">the toxicities and heal from the</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="7.77">diseases so in this case as in many</text>
  <text start="150.12" dur="5.52">other cases particularly with my mom</text>
  <text start="152.61" dur="5.76">they were they&amp;#39;re really just call it</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="5.849">palliative palliative care so they just</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="6.33">call it we can&amp;#39;t cure it we cannot even</text>
  <text start="161.489" dur="5.851">treat it so we&amp;#39;ll give her up to a</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="5.58">nursing home to keep her comfortable for</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="6.38">the next six months before she dies so</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="7.5">though in those cases the doctors today</text>
  <text start="173.72" dur="7.48">we&amp;#39;re all very willing to hear our</text>
  <text start="177.78" dur="5.7">solutions and the fact that we spent the</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="4.319">better part of the last four decades at</text>
  <text start="183.48" dur="4.289">the National Cancer Institute right here</text>
  <text start="185.519" dur="6.75">in Frederick Maryland I started there</text>
  <text start="187.769" dur="6.601">June 10 1980 so it didn&amp;#39;t take I&amp;#39;m older</text>
  <text start="192.269" dur="5.03">than most the physicians here and</text>
  <text start="194.37" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re just delighted to</text>
  <text start="197.299" dur="5.831">hear solutions and and actually go out</text>
  <text start="200.82" dur="5.37">with a situation that is hopeful and not</text>
  <text start="203.13" dur="4.74">without all hope careful because if you</text>
  <text start="206.19" dur="5.94">do too much education they may shut down</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="6.33">the hospital well I I hoped I could talk</text>
  <text start="212.13" dur="4.77">really loudly where I am but I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="214.2" dur="4.95">yeah no that&amp;#39;s fine we can hear you fine</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="3.57">and I&amp;#39;m glad that they&amp;#39;re open you know</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m glad that they&amp;#39;re open I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="4.829">to doctors I&amp;#39;ve talked to the nurses and</text>
  <text start="222.75" dur="4.019">there seems to be an ego involved</text>
  <text start="225.299" dur="2.791">especially when they went to school and</text>
  <text start="226.769" dur="3">they have the correct you know the</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="4.47">credentials behind their name the paper</text>
  <text start="229.769" dur="4.381">and you know I&amp;#39;m just a lay man</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="5.58">researcher and then into these things</text>
  <text start="234.15" dur="7.02">and obviously people trust their doctor</text>
  <text start="238.14" dur="4.71">so father did many of my other family</text>
  <text start="241.17" dur="3.599">are going through cancer now won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="242.85" dur="3.919">listen to me he won&amp;#39;t even try juicing</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="5.94">or anything that might help their body</text>
  <text start="246.769" dur="7.601">so I&amp;#39;m glad that you&amp;#39;re having success</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="6.27">with that and well it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s only in</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="5.85">cases where I mean the physicians want</text>
  <text start="256.979" dur="6.321">your help I&amp;#39;m older with a few letters</text>
  <text start="260.22" dur="6.54">after our name I should say success</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="4.48">has has come at a great cost because for</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="3.54">the most part your</text>
  <text start="267.78" dur="5.1">exactly right the egos are involved and</text>
  <text start="270.3" dur="5.22">we simply dust off our flip-flops and</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="4.95">move on when an egos involved but I know</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="4.8">you&amp;#39;ve got a good doctor and I tell the</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="5.16">clients and the patients that when they</text>
  <text start="280.32" dur="5.7">actually will listen to us whether we</text>
  <text start="282.99" dur="4.71">have degrees behind our name or not you</text>
  <text start="286.02" dur="3.57">give any advice to folks out there who</text>
  <text start="287.7" dur="3.45">may be dealing with or maybe not medical</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="4.829">advice but just personal experience</text>
  <text start="291.15" dur="6.989">advice I don&amp;#39;t get in trouble but maybe</text>
  <text start="294.419" dur="6.691">dealing with a similar situation yeah I</text>
  <text start="298.139" dur="4.771">think there are a lot of good physicians</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="5.94">now especially the younger physicians</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="6.63">that are willing to listen I do I work</text>
  <text start="307.05" dur="5.01">an awful lot with the with the folks at</text>
  <text start="309.54" dur="6.06">the truth about cancer that that would</text>
  <text start="312.06" dur="6.9">be ty Bollinger and essentially everyone</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="5.79">he&amp;#39;s invited to that meeting for the</text>
  <text start="318.96" dur="5.16">last three decades dr. joe mercola</text>
  <text start="321.39" dur="6.029">different different alternative doctors</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="6.18">so I think with meetings like that and</text>
  <text start="327.419" dur="6.601">open-mindedness and always speaking from</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="8.19">a place of truth and love I mean it took</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="7.44">me it took you know literally jailing me</text>
  <text start="338.49" dur="6.36">and holding me and kicking me out of all</text>
  <text start="341.46" dur="8.07">of Medicine and science now for it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="344.85" dur="8.16">it&amp;#39;ll be seven years Sunday November</text>
  <text start="349.53" dur="8.37">18th that I was jailed you know and lost</text>
  <text start="353.01" dur="8.55">what I thought was my career and and now</text>
  <text start="357.9" dur="5.519">of course I&amp;#39;m basically helping people</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="3.54">which was all I ever wanted to do but</text>
  <text start="363.419" dur="4.771">I&amp;#39;m doing it in a different way than I</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="6.48">did it before and because I have learned</text>
  <text start="368.19" dur="6.21">to speak out of a place of love and not</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="4.23">anger which is what I&amp;#39;m table and</text>
  <text start="374.4" dur="4.769">hearing the people at the truth about</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="5.97">cancer do and just simply making it</text>
  <text start="379.169" dur="4.801">simple and offering suggestions without</text>
  <text start="381.78" dur="4.56">an ego we believe the ego at the door</text>
  <text start="383.97" dur="3.96">that things you know that that things</text>
  <text start="386.34" dur="4.77">are starting to turn around for all of</text>
  <text start="387.93" dur="5.76">us you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re a pioneer and a hero</text>
  <text start="391.11" dur="4.47">and I wanted to you know kind of go over</text>
  <text start="393.69" dur="3.33">your story I know you were kind of a</text>
  <text start="395.58" dur="3.72">whistleblower and the government came</text>
  <text start="397.02" dur="3.66">down on you hard would you like to let</text>
  <text start="399.3" dur="2.32">us know what happened with that for</text>
  <text start="400.68" dur="4.03">those who aren&amp;#39;t familiar</text>
  <text start="401.62" dur="6.359">well for those who aren&amp;#39;t familiar in in</text>
  <text start="404.71" dur="7.2">our research we always use animal cell</text>
  <text start="407.979" dur="7.381">lines to diagnose and and look at not</text>
  <text start="411.91" dur="7.35">diagnose - to test our therapies either</text>
  <text start="415.36" dur="6.93">our diagnostic therapies or our cancer</text>
  <text start="419.26" dur="6.629">therapy so we we will actually cripple</text>
  <text start="422.29" dur="6.24">animal cells cause cancer in mice</text>
  <text start="425.889" dur="5.551">primarily our animals by crippling their</text>
  <text start="428.53" dur="4.68">immune systems and then find treatments</text>
  <text start="431.44" dur="4.86">immune therapies and other natural</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="5.01">product therapies to heal the cells the</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="4.679">cancer cells to kill the cancer cells</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="4.89">and keep the normal cells happy and</text>
  <text start="440.979" dur="5.101">that&amp;#39;s usually an indirect thing yeah</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="4.8">the most chemo therapies for cancer AIDS</text>
  <text start="446.08" dur="4.41">they don&amp;#39;t come in there and just wipe</text>
  <text start="447.91" dur="5.55">out everything in sight we&amp;#39;ve actually</text>
  <text start="450.49" dur="5.489">been able to develop smart bombs and so</text>
  <text start="453.46" dur="4.56">those smart bombs can can detect no</text>
  <text start="455.979" dur="7.351">matter what the hat or coat you put on</text>
  <text start="458.02" dur="6.63">to be a decoy in trickier okay okay</text>
  <text start="463.33" dur="3.54">sorry about that guys we have a little</text>
  <text start="464.65" dur="5.55">kind of village all right so we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="7.83">hats where were we so what happens with</text>
  <text start="470.2" dur="6.649">tumor cells and and it in cancers is we</text>
  <text start="474.7" dur="5.49">put on hats and coats and we try to</text>
  <text start="476.849" dur="5.591">decoy ourselves so that so that the body</text>
  <text start="480.19" dur="4.71">and the immune system thinks it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="482.44" dur="4.11">normal cell and not a sick cell so what</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="3.93">happens with immune therapy and we use</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="4.739">plants we can do it with cannabinoid</text>
  <text start="488.83" dur="4.019">therapies that is medical marijuana we</text>
  <text start="491.289" dur="4.171">can do it with many many natural</text>
  <text start="492.849" dur="5.731">products from plants we can actually use</text>
  <text start="495.46" dur="6.3">those products to teach the immune</text>
  <text start="498.58" dur="6.149">system to recognize the decoy so when we</text>
  <text start="501.76" dur="4.65">recognize that decoy then you wake it up</text>
  <text start="504.729" dur="3.631">and it says no no you can&amp;#39;t trick me</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="4.2">because I know you&amp;#39;re a cancer cell and</text>
  <text start="508.36" dur="5.51">I&amp;#39;m going to come back and kill you and</text>
  <text start="510.61" dur="5.79">so then the immune system learns to heal</text>
  <text start="513.87" dur="3.94">primarily this is your innate immune</text>
  <text start="516.4" dur="3.36">response you&amp;#39;re the front line of</text>
  <text start="517.81" dur="4.169">defense it&amp;#39;s called a natural killer</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="4.26">cell and all it really does is recognize</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="4.621">virus infected cells</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="4.92">and recognize cancer cells and in</text>
  <text start="526.6" dur="4.53">diseases like myalgic encephalomyelitis</text>
  <text start="528.94" dur="7.35">which is called chronic fatigue syndrome</text>
  <text start="531.13" dur="8.8">in autism in cancer in HIV</text>
  <text start="536.29" dur="5.56">usually the sick cells cripple that part</text>
  <text start="539.93" dur="4.56">of your artillery that part of your</text>
  <text start="541.85" dur="4.23">machinery for killing them and so</text>
  <text start="544.49" dur="3.57">basically what the therapies we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="546.08" dur="4.259">developed my whole life regardless of</text>
  <text start="548.06" dur="4.89">the chronic complex disease we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="550.339" dur="4.951">able to wake up the immune system in</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="6.36">order to really establish a balance and</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="7.799">heal from whatever the disease okay</text>
  <text start="559.31" dur="5.55">so you mentioned medical cannabis that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.089" dur="3.241">something that people still have their</text>
  <text start="564.86" dur="5.57">hard time wrapping their head around in</text>
  <text start="566.33" dur="6.96">some cases you mention Petite syndrome</text>
  <text start="570.43" dur="5.38">obviously chronic fatigue syndrome is a</text>
  <text start="573.29" dur="5.16">is a big issue a lot of people affected</text>
  <text start="575.81" dur="4.23">by that it ruins their lives and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="578.45" dur="3.75">saying that the immune system can deal</text>
  <text start="580.04" dur="4.35">if if you go through the right things</text>
  <text start="582.2" dur="4.68">use the right natural products which are</text>
  <text start="584.39" dur="4.5">probably much cheaper than the typical</text>
  <text start="586.88" dur="5.55">system they trying to give you right</text>
  <text start="588.89" dur="6.42">well because correct because with the</text>
  <text start="592.43" dur="5.88">problem with that we&amp;#39;ve had with we as a</text>
  <text start="595.31" dur="5.94">as a community a medical community have</text>
  <text start="598.31" dur="5.76">had with diseases like chronic fatigue</text>
  <text start="601.25" dur="6.209">syndrome which is the actual scientific</text>
  <text start="604.07" dur="5.4">name is myalgic encephalomyelitis it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="607.459" dur="4.591">an inflammation of the muscle in the</text>
  <text start="609.47" dur="5.61">brains so inflammation when you light a</text>
  <text start="612.05" dur="6.75">fire and cause neuro inflammation you</text>
  <text start="615.08" dur="6.629">you caused an awful lot of injury</text>
  <text start="618.8" dur="5.33">whether it be to the muscle a related</text>
  <text start="621.709" dur="5.101">family member is multiple sclerosis the</text>
  <text start="624.13" dur="6.12">neurodegenerative diseases Parkinson&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="626.81" dur="6.24">and of course we know that you know</text>
  <text start="630.25" dur="5.05">autism spectrum disorders are the</text>
  <text start="633.05" dur="4.77">microglia that&amp;#39;s one of your frontline</text>
  <text start="635.3" dur="6.39">troops of the immune system at your</text>
  <text start="637.82" dur="6.42">brain immune cell primarily the</text>
  <text start="641.69" dur="4.95">microglia and the mitochondria there</text>

  <text start="651.29" dur="5.549">in both of these diseases and in cancer</text>
  <text start="654.07" dur="5.28">so in chronic fatigue syndrome that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="656.839" dur="5.491">why you&amp;#39;re tired because the</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="7.9">inflammation of your muscles is driving</text>
  <text start="662.33" dur="7.499">the energy the breakdown of ATP in order</text>
  <text start="667.25" dur="6.78">to try to heal the womb and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="669.829" dur="6.031">have any energy to do anything else and</text>
  <text start="674.03" dur="3.63">and just kind of an idea because I know</text>
  <text start="675.86" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s gonna vary case-by-case but</text>
  <text start="677.66" dur="6.57">compared to the typical medical</text>
  <text start="680.63" dur="5.22">establishments approach how was the</text>
  <text start="684.23" dur="4.32">success rate here and what&amp;#39;s the cost</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="6.9">versus their you know customers rather</text>
  <text start="688.55" dur="6.51">than killer approach well you know the</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="4.35">treatment that that patients with these</text>
  <text start="695.06" dur="4.68">diseases have had in the past</text>
  <text start="697.1" dur="5.58">for instance chronic fatigue syndrome is</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="4.74">basically you&amp;#39;re crazy</text>
  <text start="702.68" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with you you look</text>
  <text start="704.48" dur="6.359">fine get over it you&amp;#39;re tired or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="707.63" dur="5.699">a whiner or whatever it is you know and</text>
  <text start="710.839" dur="5.25">and and basically they get cognitive</text>
  <text start="713.329" dur="4.801">behavioral therapy when in fact when we</text>
  <text start="716.089" dur="5.101">show that it&amp;#39;s an inflammatory disease</text>
  <text start="718.13" dur="5.85">and we treat as an inflammatory disease</text>
  <text start="721.19" dur="5.7">as a neuro inflammatory disease where</text>
  <text start="723.98" dur="5.099">the flame the fire in the brain is</text>
  <text start="726.89" dur="4.77">crippling the rest of the body systems</text>
  <text start="729.079" dur="5.791">whether it be cardiovascular the lung</text>
  <text start="731.66" dur="5.82">the muscles the the liver priming the</text>
  <text start="734.87" dur="5.6">detox machinery so when you treat with</text>
  <text start="737.48" dur="5.729">natural products of anti-inflammatories</text>
  <text start="740.47" dur="5.05">oxidative relieve oxidative stress with</text>
  <text start="743.209" dur="5.82">things like hyperbaric chamber when you</text>
  <text start="745.52" dur="5.88">do neurofeedback in order to take the</text>
  <text start="749.029" dur="5.281">circuitry and teach it how to reconnect</text>
  <text start="751.4" dur="5.82">because the microglia actually act like</text>
  <text start="754.31" dur="4.26">pac-man and they go take all the toxins</text>
  <text start="757.22" dur="4.05">out of the brain but they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="758.57" dur="5.16">time to do their natural job which is</text>
  <text start="761.27" dur="4.71">making the connections so we will use a</text>
  <text start="763.73" dur="5.64">variety of therapies it&amp;#39;s the cost of</text>
  <text start="765.98" dur="5.94">the of the if intervention I think your</text>
  <text start="769.37" dur="6.12">audience will appreciate what we did in</text>
  <text start="771.92" dur="7.53">cancer and AIDS HIV AIDS</text>
  <text start="775.49" dur="6.48">we is recognized as early as possible so</text>
  <text start="779.45" dur="6.06">if you get the earliest detection of the</text>
  <text start="781.97" dur="6.42">disease development or the genetics or</text>
  <text start="785.51" dur="5.519">the epigenetic susceptibilities what you</text>
  <text start="788.39" dur="5.069">can then do is stop the progression of</text>
  <text start="791.029" dur="4.861">the disease with you know really simple</text>
  <text start="793.459" dur="6.121">natural product solutions and healing</text>
  <text start="795.89" dur="7.88">and cannabis is one of them because now</text>
  <text start="799.58" dur="7.88">we consider these diseases as acquired</text>
  <text start="803.77" dur="5.98">endocannabinoid an immune deficiency or</text>
  <text start="807.46" dur="5.38">dysfunction so when you think about</text>
  <text start="809.75" dur="6.89">these diseases that way with all we</text>
  <text start="812.84" dur="6.57">learned in hiv/aids we can use the same</text>
  <text start="816.64" dur="6.55">therapies in different kinds of</text>
  <text start="819.41" dur="6.66">protocols in order to re-establish the</text>
  <text start="823.19" dur="5.28">balance in the median system and you</text>
  <text start="826.07" dur="6">know honestly our success with hiv/aids</text>
  <text start="828.47" dur="5.88">was astounding to all of us because the</text>
  <text start="832.07" dur="4.92">immune system was so ravaged by that</text>
  <text start="834.35" dur="6.54">family of viruses so what I started to</text>
  <text start="836.99" dur="7.95">say earlier about my story is what</text>
  <text start="840.89" dur="7.2">happened to me is in 2009 we published</text>
  <text start="844.94" dur="7.26">for the first time ever the isolation of</text>
  <text start="848.09" dur="6.81">an HIV like virus a retrovirus</text>
  <text start="852.2" dur="5.67">from people with chronic fatigue</text>
  <text start="854.9" dur="5.34">syndrome people with cancer people with</text>
  <text start="857.87" dur="4.71">autism spectrum disorders and in</text>
  <text start="860.24" dur="6.45">families showing evidence of infection</text>
  <text start="862.58" dur="6.24">of the family so what happened with that</text>
  <text start="866.69" dur="5.7">was the realization that because these</text>
  <text start="868.82" dur="8.25">we were actually mouths like viruses so</text>
  <text start="872.39" dur="9">the the closest family member to HIV is</text>
  <text start="877.07" dur="7.62">a monkey retrovirus so now we have here</text>
  <text start="881.39" dur="7.74">now we have here amounts of retrovirus</text>
  <text start="884.69" dur="6.93">that likely came from mice and jumped in</text>
  <text start="889.13" dur="6.98">it&amp;#39;s called zoonosis into the human</text>
  <text start="891.62" dur="8.52">population well that probably happened</text>
  <text start="896.11" dur="7.78">several generations ago and the biggest</text>
  <text start="900.14" dur="7.2">single source of mouths like viruses in</text>
  <text start="903.89" dur="7.26">the human population right now is coming</text>
  <text start="907.34" dur="7.17">from the injected mouse tissue that is</text>
  <text start="911.15" dur="7.32">happening in vaccines so one of our</text>
  <text start="914.51" dur="6.81">colleagues in hiv/aids in 2011 he wrote</text>
  <text start="918.47" dur="7.47">the paper and said the most likely way</text>
  <text start="921.32" dur="9.3">that Mouse virus has got into humans was</text>
  <text start="925.94" dur="7.08">via vaccines and so obviously the</text>
  <text start="930.62" dur="5.43">government recognized the possible</text>
  <text start="933.02" dur="5.82">of this and when it all came down and</text>
  <text start="936.05" dur="5.01">the science supported it it also</text>
  <text start="938.84" dur="4.17">supported the kind of inflammation and</text>
  <text start="941.06" dur="5.28">Andy Wakefield showed in the</text>
  <text start="943.01" dur="5.88">gastrointestinal tract so 71st item your</text>
  <text start="946.34" dur="4.92">immune system is in your gut so when you</text>
  <text start="948.89" dur="4.11">damage the gut you start crippling the</text>
  <text start="951.26" dur="5.61">immune system and we knew this was</text>
  <text start="953" dur="6.57">happening in some in some of in some of</text>
  <text start="956.87" dur="5.28">the cases of the people other children</text>
  <text start="959.57" dur="5.79">the infants who developed autism later</text>
  <text start="962.15" dur="6.39">on so we we appreciated the same</text>
  <text start="965.36" dur="6.15">pathology which was the pathology and</text>
  <text start="968.54" dur="6.92">the government basically did to me what</text>
  <text start="971.51" dur="6.99">they did to Andy Wakefield only because</text>
  <text start="975.46" dur="7.21">dr. resetti and I dr. Frank Crosetti and</text>
  <text start="978.5" dur="6.57">I refused to throw away the data as was</text>
  <text start="982.67" dur="5.55">done in the Thompson validation study</text>
  <text start="985.07" dur="5.22">and refused to say that the data weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="988.22" dur="4.92">right and true yeah we got the sequence</text>
  <text start="990.29" dur="4.77">because of the virus wrong who cares we</text>
  <text start="993.14" dur="4.29">didn&amp;#39;t have the sequence of HIV for</text>
  <text start="995.06" dur="5.31">several years and we still don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="997.43" dur="6.18">many of the strains of various family</text>
  <text start="1000.37" dur="5.28">members of HIV or htlv ones so there are</text>
  <text start="1003.61" dur="5.52">a lot of family members and we get that</text>
  <text start="1005.65" dur="7.74">but what the government chose to do when</text>
  <text start="1009.13" dur="8.12">I refused to renounce the data or throw</text>
  <text start="1013.39" dur="8.16">it away or cover it up</text>
  <text start="1017.25" dur="7.54">they basically fabricated crimes had me</text>
  <text start="1021.55" dur="8.37">arrested jailed me too kept me out of</text>
  <text start="1024.79" dur="8.52">science you know since November of 2018</text>
  <text start="1029.92" dur="8.07">I mean 11 so it&amp;#39;s 2080 now so November</text>
  <text start="1033.31" dur="7.59">18 2011 after essentially six weeks I</text>
  <text start="1037.99" dur="6.06">was fired on September 29 for</text>
  <text start="1040.9" dur="5.22">insubordination and insolence and what</text>
  <text start="1044.05" dur="6.39">that basically means is I refuse the</text>
  <text start="1046.12" dur="6.18">direct order to commit a crime and I</text>
  <text start="1050.44" dur="5.34">wouldn&amp;#39;t do it and I wouldn&amp;#39;t cover it</text>
  <text start="1052.3" dur="7.65">up and I wouldn&amp;#39;t change the fact and so</text>
  <text start="1055.78" dur="7.83">I was fired and I was insolent because I</text>
  <text start="1059.95" dur="5.88">I think I said a cuss word when asked to</text>
  <text start="1063.61" dur="3.8">do that so I have to learn to simply say</text>
  <text start="1065.83" dur="4.5">no thank</text>
  <text start="1067.41" dur="5.62">I&amp;#39;m learning that and in the past seven</text>
  <text start="1070.33" dur="6.12">years but essentially over the course of</text>
  <text start="1073.03" dur="6.03">the next six weeks my reputation was</text>
  <text start="1076.45" dur="5.07">destroyed in and it was very intentional</text>
  <text start="1079.06" dur="4.92">with the germinal science which is one</text>
  <text start="1081.52" dur="4.74">of the premier journals in the world so</text>
  <text start="1083.98" dur="4.95">the journal science basically published</text>
  <text start="1086.26" dur="6.12">propaganda in order to send a very clear</text>
  <text start="1088.93" dur="6.24">message to anyone who went down this</text>
  <text start="1092.38" dur="4.89">road and said you know autism spectrum</text>
  <text start="1095.17" dur="4.74">disorder or chronic fatigue syndrome</text>
  <text start="1097.27" dur="6.42">which are thought to be behavioral</text>
  <text start="1099.91" dur="7.64">diseases psychosomatic you made them up</text>
  <text start="1103.69" dur="5.67">or it&amp;#39;s your family&amp;#39;s fault it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1107.55" dur="4.18">neurodevelopmental well its</text>
  <text start="1109.36" dur="5.01">neurodevelopmental because you started a</text>
  <text start="1111.73" dur="4.38">flame and the device in the in the in</text>
  <text start="1114.37" dur="6.12">the brains of these children with</text>
  <text start="1116.11" dur="6.81">neurotropic HIV like viruses crippling</text>

  <text start="1122.92" dur="6.3">progression of these devastating</text>
  <text start="1126.01" dur="5.76">diseases so the good news is we can fix</text>
  <text start="1129.22" dur="5.37">it the good news is they didn&amp;#39;t succeed</text>
  <text start="1131.77" dur="6.6">at killing me they didn&amp;#39;t succeed in</text>
  <text start="1134.59" dur="6.21">getting me to kill myself you know and</text>
  <text start="1138.37" dur="5.64">we memorialized all of this including</text>

  <text start="1155.92" dur="6.24">very clearly in the book and I guess</text>
  <text start="1159.94" dur="4.83">this is how we win with people like Hugh</text>

  <text start="1164.77" dur="5.79">we have the huge cultural barrier to</text>
  <text start="1167.32" dur="6.69">overcome because we as a society trust</text>

  <text start="1452.08" dur="4.26">you said they&amp;#39;re not exposed to the</text>

  <text start="1461.11" dur="4.38">for those who don&amp;#39;t want to believe this</text>
  <text start="1462.85" dur="4.71">kind of thing you know it&amp;#39;s absolutely</text>
  <text start="1465.49" dur="2.58">true and the incentives are in place to</text>
  <text start="1467.56" dur="3.57">keep it</text>
  <text start="1468.07" dur="6.02">people will follow the incentive 19</text>
  <text start="1471.13" dur="5.73">action at a time at least resistance so</text>
  <text start="1474.09" dur="4.87">you know you you&amp;#39;ve brought up some</text>
  <text start="1476.86" dur="5.31">interesting things they try to destroy</text>
  <text start="1478.96" dur="5.55">the the person instead of the actual</text>

  <text start="1484.51" dur="4.65">debate skills 101 you know attack the</text>
  <text start="1486.79" dur="3.39">person you address the argument and they</text>
  <text start="1489.16" dur="6.03">don&amp;#39;t want to do that they try to</text>
  <text start="1490.18" dur="6.48">manufacture this this idea of like they</text>
  <text start="1495.19" dur="3.51">do in the climate change scenario they</text>
  <text start="1496.66" dur="3.54">try to manufacture this idea of well</text>
  <text start="1498.7" dur="5.28">everybody agrees with it so therefore</text>
  <text start="1500.2" dur="5.97">we&amp;#39;re in the right 99 percent of</text>
  <text start="1503.98" dur="6.63">scientists agree or consensus or</text>
  <text start="1506.17" dur="7.05">anything science works all right yeah</text>
  <text start="1510.61" dur="6.24">and in fact you&amp;#39;ll hear over and over</text>
  <text start="1513.22" dur="6.06">and over again you know oh the science</text>
  <text start="1516.85" dur="5.31">does the science is settled well science</text>
  <text start="1519.28" dur="5.25">has never settled we learn every day and</text>
  <text start="1522.16" dur="5.97">and in fact you know what what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1524.53" dur="6.39">learned today will likely you know save</text>
  <text start="1528.13" dur="7.17">my mother&amp;#39;s life but if I weren&amp;#39;t here</text>
  <text start="1530.92" dur="8.43">on two occasions in August and and now</text>
  <text start="1535.3" dur="7.14">here now in in November she could have</text>
  <text start="1539.35" dur="6.57">died because we refused to let them add</text>
  <text start="1542.44" dur="5.76">procedures or drugs or do things that</text>
  <text start="1545.92" dur="5.13">would have further compromised her</text>
  <text start="1548.2" dur="7.14">already compromised system so now we</text>
  <text start="1551.05" dur="8.31">have an opportunity to take the mass</text>
  <text start="1555.34" dur="7.53">which wasn&amp;#39;t a which was in a malignant</text>
  <text start="1559.36" dur="6">tumor and and and simply heal her liver</text>
  <text start="1562.87" dur="4.83">and teach her liver how to detox from</text>
  <text start="1565.36" dur="4.68">the tumor cells that were in her liver</text>
  <text start="1567.7" dur="4.23">but now her immune system won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1570.04" dur="5.04">overwhelmed but so science has never</text>
  <text start="1571.93" dur="7.05">settled we learn and when we can talk</text>
  <text start="1575.08" dur="6.9">without when we can talk without you</text>
  <text start="1578.98" dur="4.86">know essentially the only reason that my</text>
  <text start="1581.98" dur="4.89">mother has some kind of hope right now</text>
  <text start="1583.84" dur="5.58">is because the doctors gave up on her</text>
  <text start="1586.87" dur="4.89">and so many of the patients they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="1589.42" dur="4.53">shuffled to hospice or shuffled to</text>
  <text start="1591.76" dur="4.77">something else saying we can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1593.95" dur="5.97">anything more for you with our with our</text>
  <text start="1596.53" dur="4.85">sick care so just go away and so most</text>
  <text start="1599.92" dur="4.24">people don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1601.38" dur="6.33">um you know nutritional biochemistry</text>
  <text start="1604.16" dur="6.76">trained kids who kind of don&amp;#39;t give up</text>
  <text start="1607.71" dur="6.12">but the important thing is that we learn</text>
  <text start="1610.92" dur="5.79">to talk to each other and not shoot the</text>
  <text start="1613.83" dur="5.67">messenger and not talk liability you</text>
  <text start="1616.71" dur="6.03">know so I think that the problem we have</text>
  <text start="1619.5" dur="5.67">a lawsuit so then the compensation</text>
  <text start="1622.74" dur="7.47">program better known as vaccine court</text>
  <text start="1625.17" dur="9.06">was put in place to try to help deal and</text>
  <text start="1630.21" dur="7.92">and help be injured we admit that that</text>
  <text start="1634.23" dur="7.2">one size doesn&amp;#39;t fit all and in back</text>
  <text start="1638.13" dur="5.16">with the smallpox vaccine seven percent</text>
  <text start="1641.43" dur="5.49">of all the people who got the vaccine</text>
  <text start="1643.29" dur="6.68">were killed if not severely injured but</text>
  <text start="1646.92" dur="6.63">at that times smallpox was killing</text>
  <text start="1649.97" dur="5.8">ninety percent so the seven percent was</text>
  <text start="1653.55" dur="4.86">worth the risk right now with the</text>
  <text start="1655.77" dur="5.25">vaccine program the risk doesn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="1658.41" dur="5.28">anywhere close the benefit doesn&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="1661.02" dur="5.82">anywhere close to covering the risks of</text>
  <text start="1663.69" dur="6.57">the ingredients in those vaccines so in</text>
  <text start="1666.84" dur="6.78">fact the compensation program if the if</text>
  <text start="1670.26" dur="4.83">the Department of Justice lawyers if the</text>
  <text start="1673.62" dur="4.35">lawyers for the Health and Human</text>
  <text start="1675.09" dur="7.89">Services hadn&amp;#39;t literally committed</text>
  <text start="1677.97" dur="7.98">fraud back in 2001 and kept a test case</text>
  <text start="1682.98" dur="6.57">that was called Hana polling so Hana</text>
  <text start="1685.95" dur="6.06">polling absolutely got a diagnosis of</text>
  <text start="1689.55" dur="5.49">autism and cephalopoda brain</text>
  <text start="1692.01" dur="6.36">inflammation that caused the loss of</text>
  <text start="1695.04" dur="6.09">function and skills and speech she it</text>
  <text start="1698.37" dur="5.73">absolutely showed that was the result of</text>
  <text start="1701.13" dur="5.16">the vaccines and she was she had a mind</text>
  <text start="1704.1" dur="3.78">to chondral deficiency that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1706.29" dur="3.72">know about at the time but this is why</text>
  <text start="1707.88" dur="4.56">we don&amp;#39;t just inject everybody the first</text>
  <text start="1710.01" dur="5.07">day they&amp;#39;re born we test to see who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1712.44" dur="5.49">susceptible to the most risk and so you</text>
  <text start="1715.08" dur="6.26">mentioned Tuskegee experiments what we</text>
  <text start="1717.93" dur="6.57">learned with what we learned with the</text>
  <text start="1721.34" dur="5.68">blacks being five times more susceptible</text>
  <text start="1724.5" dur="5.49">so what we learned in the Thompson study</text>
  <text start="1727.02" dur="5.49">that was covered up since 2001 when</text>
  <text start="1729.99" dur="4.88">those scientists actually destroyed the</text>
  <text start="1732.51" dur="4.97">data when they didn&amp;#39;t under</text>
  <text start="1734.87" dur="5.82">and the data what we learned was that</text>
  <text start="1737.48" dur="6.9">blacks were four times more likely to</text>
  <text start="1740.69" dur="6.15">get that autism from MMR if that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1744.38" dur="6.51">three RNA virus solution if they were</text>
  <text start="1746.84" dur="4.89">given that MMR before they were three</text>
  <text start="1750.89" dur="3.3">years old</text>
  <text start="1751.73" dur="6">so what astounded me when I learned this</text>
  <text start="1754.19" dur="6.3">in 2014 when the work of Brian hooker</text>
  <text start="1757.73" dur="4.65">came out exposing this fraud and</text>
  <text start="1760.49" dur="4.23">Thompson admitted that they threw the</text>
  <text start="1762.38" dur="5.4">date away this is you can find out all</text>
  <text start="1764.72" dur="5.01">about this in the book and occu lated by</text>
  <text start="1767.78" dur="4.29">Ken tech and lively the co-author on</text>
  <text start="1769.73" dur="6.11">plague and in many other books you there</text>
  <text start="1772.07" dur="6.78">are books that you can make available to</text>
  <text start="1775.84" dur="4.9">two-year listeners and your audience so</text>
  <text start="1778.85" dur="4.77">in any rate when we found all this</text>
  <text start="1780.74" dur="5.96">without you know basically they just</text>
  <text start="1783.62" dur="5.79">they they covered it all up now since</text>
  <text start="1786.7" dur="5.41">2014</text>
  <text start="1789.41" dur="5.49">a Florida Senator Posey had all of this</text>
  <text start="1792.11" dur="5.699">in you know literally in Congress to</text>
  <text start="1794.9" dur="8.07">show them that in fact you know at that</text>
  <text start="1797.809" dur="8.37">time there were more than 5,000 cases of</text>
  <text start="1802.97" dur="6.209">that of MMR causing autism in the</text>
  <text start="1806.179" dur="6.571">vaccine court well if Hannah Poland&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1809.179" dur="6.571">tests case which it did were known to</text>
  <text start="1812.75" dur="6.75">have been shown to be positive that is -</text>
  <text start="1815.75" dur="7.23">that vaccine can cause autism in the</text>
  <text start="1819.5" dur="6.54">susceptible child then 5,000 people</text>
  <text start="1822.98" dur="8.73">would have had to be compensated at at</text>
  <text start="1826.04" dur="7.95">least 250,000 dollars per case and there</text>
  <text start="1831.71" dur="4.68">were many many more about behind that</text>
  <text start="1833.99" dur="6.03">then in fact it would have bankrupted</text>
  <text start="1836.39" dur="7.23">the entire program if not the economy of</text>
  <text start="1840.02" dur="5.67">this nation back 18 years ago so they</text>
  <text start="1843.62" dur="5.04">chose as they chose with what our</text>
  <text start="1845.69" dur="5.88">discoveries revealed to simply cover it</text>
  <text start="1848.66" dur="6.69">up you know and hope nobody would find</text>
  <text start="1851.57" dur="6.359">out and and and corrupt you know the</text>
  <text start="1855.35" dur="5.16">vaccine court which is I mean it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1857.929" dur="4.38">kangaroo court beyond comprehension and</text>
  <text start="1860.51" dur="3.87">and most people don&amp;#39;t even know it</text>
  <text start="1862.309" dur="4.411">exists so people go through their lives</text>
  <text start="1864.38" dur="4.23">thinking that Oh</text>
  <text start="1866.72" dur="4.2">Gardasil prevents cancer</text>
  <text start="1868.61" dur="5.97">since they don&amp;#39;t developed they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1870.92" dur="6.27">develop vaccines or cancer or treatment</text>
  <text start="1874.58" dur="4.83">or prevention and nobody knows that it</text>
  <text start="1877.19" dur="4.35">wasn&amp;#39;t even developed to prevent cancer</text>
  <text start="1879.41" dur="5.25">it was developed to prevent something</text>
  <text start="1881.54" dur="7.83">called CIN 3 plus which is basically a</text>
  <text start="1884.66" dur="8.13">wart on your staring so you know HPV by</text>
  <text start="1889.37" dur="7.08">itself in a healthy person is cleared in</text>
  <text start="1892.79" dur="7.11">99% of the case because an HPV alone</text>
  <text start="1896.45" dur="6.69">does not cause cancer does not cause</text>
  <text start="1899.9" dur="5.79">cervical cancer cervical cancer is not a</text>
  <text start="1903.14" dur="6.51">public health threat and and yet these</text>
  <text start="1905.69" dur="6.18">vaccine is now mandated for nine year</text>
  <text start="1909.65" dur="4.7">olds it was never tested in a nine year</text>
  <text start="1911.87" dur="5.88">old it was never tested in a teenager</text>
  <text start="1914.35" dur="7.63">and in fact it was never tested with a</text>
  <text start="1917.75" dur="7.65">saline or a placebo nothing in nerd</text>
  <text start="1921.98" dur="6.15">control nor were any of the vaccines so</text>
  <text start="1925.4" dur="6.69">on so here we have not a single safety</text>
  <text start="1928.13" dur="8.73">study as RFK jr. won that case along</text>
  <text start="1932.09" dur="7.35">with them delving tree showing for three</text>
  <text start="1936.86" dur="5.52">years they did FOIA after FOIA after</text>
  <text start="1939.44" dur="5.79">employer to Freedom of Information Act</text>
  <text start="1942.38" dur="5.97">to get the information on the data of</text>
  <text start="1945.23" dur="6.27">the safety studies and now one safety</text>
  <text start="1948.35" dur="6.329">study could be presented that had been</text>
  <text start="1951.5" dur="7.59">done in thirty two years since they</text>
  <text start="1954.679" dur="6.301">started vaccine Court in 1988 so this is</text>
  <text start="1959.09" dur="4.35">these are the kinds of pieces of</text>
  <text start="1960.98" dur="4.829">information on the plague of the</text>

  <text start="1965.809" dur="6.901">show science learns science is never</text>
  <text start="1968.69" dur="7.32">settled and you know essentially we have</text>

  <text start="2008.63" dur="4.74">reliance on censorship and smear tactics</text>

  <text start="2672.619" dur="3.98">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the kind of things yes</text>

  <text start="2676.599" dur="5.831">therapeutic plant a very nutritious food</text>
  <text start="2680.03" dur="5.13">but one has to think I&amp;#39;m about eating</text>
  <text start="2682.43" dur="6.57">the leaves just like strychnine which is</text>
  <text start="2685.16" dur="5.67">a poison or you know okay it comes from</text>
  <text start="2689" dur="4.2">a plant that has quite a number of</text>
  <text start="2690.83" dur="4.43">healing properties there are also</text>
  <text start="2693.2" dur="4.5">poisonous things it really an</text>
  <text start="2695.26" dur="5.829">essentially every natural product if you</text>
  <text start="2697.7" dur="4.83">use wrong people even have you know they</text>
  <text start="2701.089" dur="4.77">like bell peppers Mill peppers are</text>
  <text start="2702.53" dur="5.67">poisonous anyway because the worst case</text>
  <text start="2705.859" dur="4.021">is maybe a little gas or something and</text>
  <text start="2708.2" dur="2.88">you said something that shocked me you</text>
  <text start="2709.88" dur="2.459">said there are certain types of beers</text>
  <text start="2711.08" dur="4.279">that are good for you how are you not</text>
  <text start="2712.339" dur="6.861">the most famous doctor ever and they</text>
  <text start="2715.359" dur="6.461">thanked people left and right after that</text>
  <text start="2719.2" dur="4.72">so you know we&amp;#39;ve went over the</text>
  <text start="2721.82" dur="3.57">cannabinoid system which you know I like</text>
  <text start="2723.92" dur="3.54">to talk about that because there is so</text>
  <text start="2725.39" dur="3.59">much resistance and I feel like one of</text>
  <text start="2727.46" dur="4.139">the things that I like to focus on is</text>
  <text start="2728.98" dur="5.53">breakthroughs and modern technology</text>
  <text start="2731.599" dur="5.281">paradigm shifters you know not just in</text>
  <text start="2734.51" dur="4.5">the health aspect but technology things</text>
  <text start="2736.88" dur="5.1">like crypto currencies and stuff but I</text>
  <text start="2739.01" dur="4.92">want to try to to help people with</text>
  <text start="2741.98" dur="4.109">information that can change the world</text>
  <text start="2743.93" dur="4.53">and you know in terms of medical</text>
  <text start="2746.089" dur="3.931">marijuana right back to the incentive</text>
  <text start="2748.46" dur="3.48">thing if they were to allow that</text>
  <text start="2750.02" dur="5.819">what kind of loss of profit are we</text>
  <text start="2751.94" dur="7.86">looking at well I mean it can change the</text>
  <text start="2755.839" dur="7.081">world literally at pennies most of what</text>
  <text start="2759.8" dur="5.49">I get what&amp;#39;s made for me that I use for</text>
  <text start="2762.92" dur="6.449">medicinal purposes in our clients than</text>
  <text start="2765.29" dur="6.48">in any situation you know cost ten bucks</text>
  <text start="2769.369" dur="5.281">but by the time the government puts</text>
  <text start="2771.77" dur="6.06">taxes on it and you know the extraction</text>
  <text start="2774.65" dur="5.55">is is literally dirt cheap but by the</text>
  <text start="2777.83" dur="6.63">time the the the government starts</text>
  <text start="2780.2" dur="6.51">regulating it and tries to have various</text>
  <text start="2784.46" dur="4.68">companies or pharmaceutical companies</text>
  <text start="2786.71" dur="5.34">patent things then you&amp;#39;ve added a cost</text>
  <text start="2789.14" dur="5.219">which makes it totally prohibitive by</text>
  <text start="2792.05" dur="5.819">the time that I have to protect myself</text>
  <text start="2794.359" dur="5.971">from the government coming after me for</text>
  <text start="2797.869" dur="3.841">selling or and I don&amp;#39;t sell anything for</text>
  <text start="2800.33" dur="4.8">using and</text>
  <text start="2801.71" dur="6.389">distributing these things to people free</text>
  <text start="2805.13" dur="5.82">of charge I have to protect myself from</text>
  <text start="2808.099" dur="6.031">from from the government and you know as</text>
  <text start="2810.95" dur="6.149">I now know quite clearly so I mean this</text>
  <text start="2814.13" dur="4.92">these are the costs added the licensure</text>
  <text start="2817.099" dur="6.51">in California and some of the legal</text>
  <text start="2819.05" dur="7.289">states I mean that it can really hugely</text>
  <text start="2823.609" dur="6.061">benefit our economy we be healthier</text>
  <text start="2826.339" dur="7.111">people you know our military could be</text>
  <text start="2829.67" dur="7.29">free of PTSD or at least treated</text>
  <text start="2833.45" dur="7.74">effectively for PTSD we could treat of</text>
  <text start="2836.96" dur="7.86">course CTE the the brain injury you know</text>
  <text start="2841.19" dur="5.429">in football players with concussions you</text>
  <text start="2844.82" dur="4.68">know but what they&amp;#39;re not allowed either</text>
  <text start="2846.619" dur="4.651">athletes are young athletes one of my</text>
  <text start="2849.5" dur="4.83">biggest problems right now is college</text>
  <text start="2851.27" dur="6.089">it&amp;#39;s their their vaccine injured by</text>
  <text start="2854.33" dur="5.73">definition because they&amp;#39;ve got they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2857.359" dur="5.041">been injected with a lot of vaccines so</text>
  <text start="2860.06" dur="4.98">here they either have sleep problems or</text>
  <text start="2862.4" dur="5.28">anxiety problems or pain from their</text>
  <text start="2865.04" dur="5.67">athletic endeavors and the stress of</text>
  <text start="2867.68" dur="5.31">them from their academic endeavors that</text>
  <text start="2870.71" dur="3.99">a critical growth period so here we</text>
  <text start="2872.99" dur="4.2">could relieve all of that and give them</text>
  <text start="2874.7" dur="4.38">a sleep aid but they&amp;#39;re inferior of</text>
  <text start="2877.19" dur="4.86">being drug tested so they can&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="2879.08" dur="6.15">college again so if there&amp;#39;s a tremendous</text>
  <text start="2882.05" dur="6.48">amount of stigma but also the laws that</text>
  <text start="2885.23" dur="5.879">have to be cut through to say no this is</text>
  <text start="2888.53" dur="6">this is a natural product no we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2891.109" dur="5.791">gonna let you make it into a drug that</text>
  <text start="2894.53" dur="4.62">could be toxic because of the additives</text>
  <text start="2896.9" dur="4.8">so we certainly want to make it safe and</text>
  <text start="2899.15" dur="6.24">the FDA should regulate it just as they</text>
  <text start="2901.7" dur="6.72">would regulate spinach that got a ecoli</text>
  <text start="2905.39" dur="5.34">and you know and and this is the way it</text>
  <text start="2908.42" dur="3.48">should be the leaves should be tested</text>
  <text start="2910.73" dur="3.77">they can be used without the</text>
  <text start="2911.9" dur="6.17">psychoactive formulation right now we</text>
  <text start="2914.5" dur="6.19">quantify exactly how much THC is there</text>
  <text start="2918.07" dur="5.41">either from the hemp plant which is a</text>
  <text start="2920.69" dur="5.22">very low level or some of the sativas</text>
  <text start="2923.48" dur="5.7">which have quite high levels of THC in</text>
  <text start="2925.91" dur="6.57">the natural plant so you know all of</text>
  <text start="2929.18" dur="5.53">these kinds of processing and pen safety</text>
  <text start="2932.48" dur="5.379">should be put there for the population</text>
  <text start="2934.71" dur="6.18">and put in place by our FDA but our FDA</text>
  <text start="2937.859" dur="7.171">is is is too busy protecting themselves</text>
  <text start="2940.89" dur="6.719">from the synthetics and the in the</text>
  <text start="2945.03" dur="4.89">vaccine injuries and and the cancer</text>
  <text start="2947.609" dur="5.191">drugs now in protecting an industry so</text>
  <text start="2949.92" dur="5.25">our FDA you know really has no interest</text>
  <text start="2952.8" dur="5.1">in keeping our food supply safe more</text>
  <text start="2955.17" dur="4.949">they more they go after alternative</text>
  <text start="2957.9" dur="5.1">medicine Doc&amp;#39;s or supplement companies</text>
  <text start="2960.119" dur="6.74">who actually do these purification</text>
  <text start="2963" dur="6.33">processes and prove they&amp;#39;re not it</text>
  <text start="2966.859" dur="5.321">contaminated with glyphosate or heavy</text>
  <text start="2969.33" dur="4.529">metals in any way so all plant you know</text>
  <text start="2972.18" dur="4.29">all of our all of our supplements should</text>
  <text start="2973.859" dur="6.031">be tested for um these things and says</text>
  <text start="2976.47" dur="7.67">we understand the processes what a novel</text>
  <text start="2979.89" dur="4.25">idea the FDA should focus on our health</text>
  <text start="2984.349" dur="5.74">yeah I know I know you&amp;#39;ve had a concern</text>
  <text start="2986.82" dur="5.58">so I have a few more questions the big</text>
  <text start="2990.089" dur="3.961">one is are we making progress are we</text>
  <text start="2992.4" dur="3.54">starting to turn the tide on this I know</text>
  <text start="2994.05" dur="5.97">half the nation is legalized marijuana</text>
  <text start="2995.94" dur="5.7">now I know I think people who choose to</text>
  <text start="3000.02" dur="3.329">use chemo in cancer I read that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3001.64" dur="3.9">down from 30 percent to about half that</text>
  <text start="3003.349" dur="4.051">now I feel like we&amp;#39;re turning the tide</text>
  <text start="3005.54" dur="5.22">and information but have you seen any</text>
  <text start="3007.4" dur="6.33">signs of that sure I think um I think</text>
  <text start="3010.76" dur="7.349">just where I am right now I think the</text>
  <text start="3013.73" dur="6.72">amount of disease is just so high where</text>
  <text start="3018.109" dur="3.931">the pharmaceutical industry is just</text>
  <text start="3020.45" dur="4.05">throwing up their hands and all we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3022.04" dur="4.95">bill all we&amp;#39;re doing is building more</text>
  <text start="3024.5" dur="5.339">and more cancer centers and more and</text>
  <text start="3026.99" dur="5.55">more rehab facilities where we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="3029.839" dur="5.221">basically throwing people away and</text>
  <text start="3032.54" dur="5.13">locking them up and we are doing</text>
  <text start="3035.06" dur="5.7">bloodletting by the way sure these</text>
  <text start="3037.67" dur="6.12">things come full circle because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3040.76" dur="7.95">allopathic solution to you know some of</text>
  <text start="3043.79" dur="7.47">these what they call neuro psychosomatic</text>
  <text start="3048.71" dur="5.159">diseases they you know that your brain</text>
  <text start="3051.26" dur="5.07">is just as much on fire as any other</text>
  <text start="3053.869" dur="5.371">organ system and and can spark it and</text>
  <text start="3056.33" dur="6">cause behavioral issues so yes I see us</text>
  <text start="3059.24" dur="5.43">making huge progress and I mainly drew</text>
  <text start="3062.33" dur="4.41">you know the alternative Menace and yet</text>
  <text start="3064.67" dur="3.98">people like you on you know younger</text>
  <text start="3066.74" dur="5.15">people talking to younger</text>
  <text start="3068.65" dur="5.909">oh and and and people the older people</text>
  <text start="3071.89" dur="6.03">that&amp;#39;s why I always like just to put the</text>
  <text start="3074.559" dur="5.79">age on my CV it&amp;#39;s they got my degree in</text>
  <text start="3077.92" dur="5.369">nineteen eighty on sixty years old</text>
  <text start="3080.349" dur="5.52">because I&amp;#39;ve never been inoculated with</text>
  <text start="3083.289" dur="5.161">anything I&amp;#39;ve never been injected oh I</text>
  <text start="3085.869" dur="4.5">think I got smallpox but that was</text>
  <text start="3088.45" dur="4.829">actually cow pox that&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="3090.369" dur="6.601">relative of smallpox so it wasn&amp;#39;t an</text>
  <text start="3093.279" dur="5.971">attenuated manipulated pathogen it was</text>
  <text start="3096.97" dur="4.47">it was a family member that meant if I</text>
  <text start="3099.25" dur="5.16">were exposed I wouldn&amp;#39;t get in a severe</text>
  <text start="3101.44" dur="5.79">disease so and and a polio Amish sugar</text>
  <text start="3104.41" dur="4.919">cube which was simply the antigen with</text>
  <text start="3107.23" dur="4.74">the you know what delivered in a</text>
  <text start="3109.329" dur="4.921">different way um so that I&amp;#39;m protected</text>
  <text start="3111.97" dur="4.77">and immune i got a natural measles</text>
  <text start="3114.25" dur="5.88">infection so i&amp;#39;m immune from her life so</text>
  <text start="3116.74" dur="5.849">i do see as the information comes out</text>
  <text start="3120.13" dur="4.79">when people start asking the right</text>
  <text start="3122.589" dur="5.131">questions like this whole herd immunity</text>
  <text start="3124.92" dur="6.76">well so we can teach your audience well</text>
  <text start="3127.72" dur="6.96">how can a healthy baby make a child sick</text>
  <text start="3131.68" dur="5.52">so so the anger and say oh you&amp;#39;re your</text>
  <text start="3134.68" dur="5.7">child because they&amp;#39;re not vaccinating is</text>
  <text start="3137.2" dur="5.82">putting my child at risks that just</text>
  <text start="3140.38" dur="5.01">simply is impossible and when you say</text>
  <text start="3143.02" dur="6.599">how can my child who&amp;#39;s never been</text>
  <text start="3145.39" dur="7.74">exposed to diphtheria because in fact if</text>
  <text start="3149.619" dur="6.541">theoria has been largely eradicated from</text>
  <text start="3153.13" dur="6.3">the united states with only one case a</text>
  <text start="3156.16" dur="5.79">year in the last decade out of 300</text>
  <text start="3159.43" dur="5.099">million people so how actually is your</text>
  <text start="3161.95" dur="3.99">is your child going to get diphtheria</text>
  <text start="3164.529" dur="3.991">from my child</text>
  <text start="3165.94" dur="5.58">same thing with tetanus you get tetanus</text>
  <text start="3168.52" dur="5.579">from a deep puncture wound it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="3171.52" dur="5.73">communicable disease and the vaccine is</text>
  <text start="3174.099" dur="5.25">only intended to treat in case you were</text>
  <text start="3177.25" dur="4.319">infected okay so then you get to</text>
  <text start="3179.349" dur="4.531">pertussis in the whooping cough and we</text>
  <text start="3181.569" dur="6.181">know that what we&amp;#39;re doing with your to</text>
  <text start="3183.88" dur="6.54">pertussis vaccine is so bad that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3187.75" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s literally causing the colonization</text>
  <text start="3190.42" dur="6.57">the bacteria actually get in your lungs</text>
  <text start="3193.51" dur="5.88">and you don&amp;#39;t call so you are putting it</text>
  <text start="3196.99" dur="4.92">at risk your child because you think</text>
  <text start="3199.39" dur="5.31">you&amp;#39;re not spreading the</text>
  <text start="3201.91" dur="5.639">disease or the bacteria so that it can</text>
  <text start="3204.7" dur="5.609">colonize the lungs and in fact you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3207.549" dur="5.54">simply not coughing so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s putting</text>
  <text start="3210.309" dur="5.401">it&amp;#39;s a decoy that is putting that that</text>
  <text start="3213.089" dur="5.051">two-month-old it great risk or you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3215.71" dur="4.409">you&amp;#39;re young young baby at great risk in</text>
  <text start="3218.14" dur="4.199">here the commercials with the big bad</text>
  <text start="3220.119" dur="4.68">wolf so we are making a lot of progress</text>
  <text start="3222.339" dur="5.25">but one of the things we can do to stop</text>
  <text start="3224.799" dur="6.481">all of it is take every one of the</text>
  <text start="3227.589" dur="7.441">commercials for any pharmaceutical off</text>
  <text start="3231.28" dur="6.9">our TVs it we are only one of two</text>
  <text start="3235.03" dur="5.49">civilized so I call it to the like some</text>
  <text start="3238.18" dur="4.53">countries that away in the Western world</text>
  <text start="3240.52" dur="5.819">that allow direct-to-consumer</text>
  <text start="3242.71" dur="7.23">advertising so for instance when you see</text>
  <text start="3246.339" dur="7.23">one of these cancer drugs oh well my</text>
  <text start="3249.94" dur="7.05">doctor said I can get t-true too because</text>
  <text start="3253.569" dur="5.671">I have PDL one I&amp;#39;m usually at that point</text>
  <text start="3256.99" dur="5.04">throwing my husband taught me to throw</text>
  <text start="3259.24" dur="6.72">the pillows instead of the hard solid</text>
  <text start="3262.03" dur="7.17">objects at the TV because what I usually</text>
  <text start="3265.96" dur="5.879">say is you have no idea what PDL one is</text>
  <text start="3269.2" dur="4.889">and neither does your doctor and so what</text>
  <text start="3271.839" dur="4.47">you said as we open the show your</text>
  <text start="3274.089" dur="5.101">doctors don&amp;#39;t develop drugs they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3276.309" dur="5.851">know physicians don&amp;#39;t know they trust</text>
  <text start="3279.19" dur="6">what they&amp;#39;re taught in in school by</text>
  <text start="3282.16" dur="5.669">pharmaceutical companies by that pretty</text>

  <text start="3372.45" dur="6.7">including hiv/aids so the day you got</text>

  <text start="3431.98" dur="4.2">the outbreaks in the vaccinated</text>
  <text start="3432.97" dur="6.72">populations so my last question for you</text>
  <text start="3436.18" dur="5.01">is and I&amp;#39;ve debated as so many years if</text>
  <text start="3439.69" dur="2.91">some tie was about 17 I got into this</text>

  <text start="3445.9" dur="3.48">we cured all of these diseases they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="3449.38" dur="5.07">you&amp;#39;ve cured everything so therefore</text>
  <text start="3451.24" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s proof that vaccines work what would</text>
  <text start="3454.45" dur="3.69">your response be to that and I know like</text>
  <text start="3456.07" dur="3.93">you like you just said that there</text>
  <text start="3458.14" dur="3.51">there&amp;#39;s damage done even if you may not</text>
  <text start="3460" dur="3.51">notice the damage done with these</text>
  <text start="3461.65" dur="4.95">vaccines but but what is your closure</text>
  <text start="3463.51" dur="5.71">addressed people who think that well in</text>
  <text start="3466.6" dur="9.47">fact we eradicated</text>

  <text start="3530.61" dur="6.509">before the measles came in long before</text>
  <text start="3533.79" dur="5.76">you know that vaccinations came in you</text>
  <text start="3537.119" dur="5.971">know we you know I simply my grandmother</text>
  <text start="3539.55" dur="6.15">had diphtheria you know and and when she</text>
  <text start="3543.09" dur="6.54">was a baby and she lived 94 years old I</text>
  <text start="3545.7" dur="6.99">never got a diphtheria shot and and</text>
  <text start="3549.63" dur="5.46">again so the vaccine has nothing to do</text>
  <text start="3552.69" dur="6.3">with eradicating day atheria so why are</text>
  <text start="3555.09" dur="7.74">we using it as a as with respect to the</text>
  <text start="3558.99" dur="8.629">development of what is now called acute</text>
  <text start="3562.83" dur="9.93">flaccid myelitis which clinically is</text>
  <text start="3567.619" dur="7.961">indistinguishable from polio is because</text>
  <text start="3572.76" dur="5.16">of environmental toxins again it&amp;#39;s in</text>

  <text start="3596.16" dur="5.78">never loves the vaccinations and with</text>
  <text start="3598.619" dur="5.151">the the worst cases Gardasil and it</text>
  <text start="3601.94" dur="3.06">makes people like me who had been in</text>
  <text start="3603.77" dur="4.799">cancer therapy</text>
  <text start="3605" dur="6.96">we had a pap smear it&amp;#39;s a test for when</text>
  <text start="3608.569" dur="6.841">you see the very earliest lesion in the</text>
  <text start="3611.96" dur="7.05">cervix all you have to do is either</text>
  <text start="3615.41" dur="6.63">freeze it or cut it off and continue to</text>
  <text start="3619.01" dur="5.819">do frequent pap smears to see if that</text>
  <text start="3622.04" dur="7.049">uncle jinuk process that tumor process</text>
  <text start="3624.829" dur="7.831">is is progressing so now when you take a</text>
  <text start="3629.089" dur="6.5">nine-year-old before she&amp;#39;s even sexually</text>
  <text start="3632.66" dur="5.669">active or been through puberty and you</text>

  <text start="3649.22" dur="5.43">the effects of the pathogen when you</text>
  <text start="3651.41" dur="6.06">when you say that to that child</text>
  <text start="3654.65" dur="4.83">she will not get a pap smear and neither</text>
  <text start="3657.47" dur="5.19">will her mother because she get</text>
  <text start="3659.48" dur="5.879">encouraged that early detection will no</text>
  <text start="3662.66" dur="7.59">longer be encouraged so um you know</text>
  <text start="3665.359" dur="6.861">things like you know colon cancer they</text>
  <text start="3670.25" dur="4.819">did the techniques that we&amp;#39;ve used</text>
  <text start="3672.22" dur="6.28">endoscopy to just see these inflammatory</text>
  <text start="3675.069" dur="6.461">processes early and earlier and detect</text>

  <text start="3681.53" dur="5.94">become before it becomes a frank cancer</text>
  <text start="3684.589" dur="6.061">so this is the problem we we cleaned up</text>
  <text start="3687.47" dur="6.389">the environment vaccines never did stop</text>
  <text start="3690.65" dur="5.939">on any of these diseases with the with</text>
  <text start="3693.859" dur="5.49">the exception of small pox and that I</text>

  <text start="3701.75" dur="4.56">from the world and we don&amp;#39;t vaccinate</text>
  <text start="3703.64" dur="4.77">against it do we the reason why we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3706.31" dur="4.799">in vaccinate is because that vaccine</text>
  <text start="3708.41" dur="4.86">still kills seven percent of the people</text>
  <text start="3711.109" dur="4.321">you give it to and there&amp;#39;s no risk</text>
  <text start="3713.27" dur="4.65">because it&amp;#39;s eradicated from the world</text>
  <text start="3715.43" dur="5.55">well there there shouldn&amp;#39;t be acute</text>
