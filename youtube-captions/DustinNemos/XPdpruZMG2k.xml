  <text start="6.6" dur="4.079">joined by my puppy here he he wants some</text>
  <text start="9.12" dur="4.47">attention hey buddy</text>
  <text start="10.679" dur="4.41">so this is this is Hachi for those who</text>
  <text start="13.59" dur="4.05">haven&amp;#39;t seen him in a while he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="15.089" dur="4.35">doing very happy very excited and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="5.61">got a fenced-in area so his collar is</text>
  <text start="19.439" dur="6.6">gone and he loves that but someone asked</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="5.58">me how do I think is the best path</text>
  <text start="26.039" dur="4.951">toward voluntary ISM all right for those</text>
  <text start="28.83" dur="3.72">who may not already know this some</text>
  <text start="30.99" dur="3.229">popular people that you look up to</text>
  <text start="32.55" dur="4.68">already like Ron Paul Judge Napolitano</text>
  <text start="34.219" dur="4.961">they are voluntary us all right</text>
  <text start="37.23" dur="4.62">Judge Napolitano made a comment</text>
  <text start="39.18" dur="5.07">basically to the extent of do you hear</text>
  <text start="41.85" dur="3.99">me denying anything and Ron Paul is</text>
  <text start="44.25" dur="3.989">clearly in has made statements toward</text>
  <text start="45.84" dur="6.899">the effect of being a voluntary us being</text>
  <text start="48.239" dur="6.811">a no government rule without rulers kind</text>
  <text start="52.739" dur="3.511">of guy this is basically you know</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="3.059">free-market and government are not</text>
  <text start="56.25" dur="4.079">compatible at all to begin with so</text>
  <text start="58.109" dur="4.231">that&amp;#39;s why we get a lot of the problems</text>
  <text start="60.329" dur="3.931">we get that&amp;#39;s why the free market is not</text>
  <text start="62.34" dur="4.23">able to do a lot of what it could do for</text>
  <text start="64.26" dur="4.23">us but I want to talk a little about</text>
  <text start="66.57" dur="3.869">this and I also want to address where</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="3.809">where the young people are why we have</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="3.661">you know why are people so into the</text>
  <text start="72.299" dur="3.981">drugs and we talked a lot about drugs I</text>
  <text start="74.1" dur="5.55">talked that with Isaac County recently</text>
  <text start="76.28" dur="6.22">my opinion on this okay and I have some</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="5.67">experience the cultural breakdown a</text>
  <text start="82.5" dur="5.189">cultural marxism has has and in many</text>
  <text start="85.32" dur="4.5">ways the multiculturalism has led to</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="4.801">that just a find Molyneux talks about</text>
  <text start="89.82" dur="3.93">how you know different non compatible</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="3.239">cultures not all completely you know</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="5.369">Chinese Americans very compatible with</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="6.121">us but non-compatible cultures in close</text>
  <text start="99.119" dur="5.161">proximity CLE create conflict and the</text>
  <text start="101.85" dur="4.229">breakdown of that cultural system you</text>
  <text start="104.28" dur="3.96">know of what we used to have in this</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="3.72">country was a very strong culture very</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="2.909">strong Western pro-capitalist</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="4.381">pro-freedom limited government kind of</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="5.461">culture that breakdown of culture has</text>
  <text start="114.18" dur="4.14">led people to not having hope not having</text>
  <text start="116.61" dur="4.98">anything to strive for not having any</text>
  <text start="118.32" dur="5.909">way to to nothing to look forward to you</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="4.919">know and that leads to things that leads</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="5.461">to nihilism giving up that leads to</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="6.601">hedonism seeking pleasure over over</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="4.379">virtue taking the easy way you know that</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="3.57">leads to</text>
  <text start="134.069" dur="5.28">Gizem you know I got into books as an</text>
  <text start="136.68" dur="4.08">escapism alright now all of my fantasy</text>
  <text start="139.349" dur="3.75">novels down here that I read as a kid</text>
  <text start="140.76" dur="3.899">and I&amp;#39;m saving from my child you know</text>
  <text start="143.099" dur="3.691">and it builds empathy it builds</text>
  <text start="144.659" dur="3.601">intelligence it builds vocabulary you</text>
  <text start="146.79" dur="4.619">may not learn how to pronounce them all</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="4.199">sometimes I mispronounce things but you</text>
  <text start="151.409" dur="2.31">know it builds these these</text>
  <text start="152.459" dur="3.39">characteristics but at the same point</text>
  <text start="153.719" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s escapism you know many of you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="155.849" dur="5.76">know this at one point I was actually a</text>
  <text start="157.739" dur="5.76">kind of a womanizer and I was that was</text>
  <text start="161.609" dur="4.74">my form of escapism you know I would</text>
  <text start="163.499" dur="4.561">lose myself in chasing chasing pleasure</text>
  <text start="166.349" dur="4.801">and hedonism and in things like that</text>
  <text start="168.06" dur="4.859">rather than try to fix my society or do</text>
  <text start="171.15" dur="3.809">anything you know I was ambitious for</text>
  <text start="172.919" dur="4.05">the money try to try to save my life and</text>
  <text start="174.959" dur="4.65">try to be free and try to get out of</text>
  <text start="176.969" dur="4.8">this country that was my goal but you</text>
  <text start="179.609" dur="4.681">know hedonism and nihilism and escapism</text>
  <text start="181.769" dur="4.291">or real now what is the path forward</text>
  <text start="184.29" dur="4.44">like well how do we get to a voluntary</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="5.69">estate or at least a better state and</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="5.58">how do these things go together well</text>
  <text start="191.75" dur="4.12">this is a complicated answer I get a lot</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="3.239">of flack from other voluntarios as to</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="3.6">why I support Trump or any government at</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="4.68">all period you know voting is violence</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="6.15">it really is if you vote for any sort of</text>
  <text start="202.229" dur="7.44">coercion to be put on other people than</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="7.109">it&amp;#39;s violence and how do I justify how</text>
  <text start="209.669" dur="5.52">do I justify that well this this debate</text>
  <text start="212.729" dur="4.5">is is largely also the Border&amp;#39;s debate</text>
  <text start="215.189" dur="3.36">and stefan molyneux and adam KO cash did</text>
  <text start="217.229" dur="3">a wonderful debate about this from the</text>
  <text start="218.549" dur="4.94">different perspectives from within</text>
  <text start="220.229" dur="4.921">voluntary ism or or you know</text>
  <text start="223.489" dur="4.84">anarcho-capitalism as as some people</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="7.53">call it kind of the opposite of anti fo</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="5.88">the anarcho communists we&amp;#39;re the guys</text>
  <text start="232.68" dur="3.57">with the bow ties the other guys with</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="3.51">the pipe bombs okay just so you</text>
  <text start="236.25" dur="3.12">understand there was a very strong</text>
  <text start="237.719" dur="4.321">anarchist political movement in the u.s.</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="4.92">before the treason and Sedition Acts or</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="4.349">whatever they arrested them all it was a</text>
  <text start="244.29" dur="4.919">big screw job okay they didn&amp;#39;t want a</text>
  <text start="246.389" dur="4.65">third party with power but how do we get</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="3.51">to that state why do I support Trump in</text>
  <text start="251.039" dur="3.66">that aspect I mean obviously there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="252.719" dur="3.39">Cuban on stuff and the the elite</text>
  <text start="254.699" dur="3.9">pedophiles and things I have to I have</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.53">to push back against that but how do i</text>
  <text start="258.599" dur="4.411">how do I support Trump on this aspect</text>
  <text start="260.639" dur="5.28">well he&amp;#39;s cutting regulations he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.01" dur="6.089">cutting taxes and he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="4.77">he&amp;#39;s also lowering the the government</text>
  <text start="269.099" dur="3.12">federal budget expenses and he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="270.689" dur="3.241">he&amp;#39;s gonna do that as well and kind of</text>
  <text start="272.219" dur="3.331">address the budget at some point you</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="3.75">know he&amp;#39;s moving people out of DC and</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="3.239">he&amp;#39;s kind of lowering some of the costs</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="2.729">and hopefully he&amp;#39;s just gonna do a mass</text>
  <text start="278.789" dur="4.5">firing at some point and clear these</text>
  <text start="280.409" dur="6.181">guys out especially the SES so these</text>
  <text start="283.289" dur="7.201">things I believe will lead people to to</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="5.729">not just jobs and productivity and and</text>
  <text start="290.49" dur="3.69">some opportunity in their lives but I</text>
  <text start="292.319" dur="4.28">also think that it will lead people back</text>
  <text start="294.18" dur="5.489">to an appreciation of limited government</text>
  <text start="296.599" dur="4.54">natural rights property rights</text>
  <text start="299.669" dur="3.601">it will lead people back to an</text>
  <text start="301.139" dur="3.12">appreciation of true capitalism which is</text>
  <text start="303.27" dur="3.929">something we have not had in this</text>
  <text start="304.259" dur="5.451">country largely for quite a while we are</text>
  <text start="307.199" dur="4.62">more socialist and communist than we are</text>
  <text start="309.71" dur="5.38">individualist and capitalist okay we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.819" dur="5.041">more collectivist obviously you know</text>
  <text start="315.09" dur="3.599">there in everything from health care to</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="5.91">you know just just think of an industry</text>
  <text start="318.689" dur="5.431">and they&amp;#39;re in it so why do I think that</text>
  <text start="322.77" dur="3.109">this would be good well I think once</text>
  <text start="324.12" dur="3.78">people get a taste of freedom again I</text>
  <text start="325.879" dur="3.641">think they&amp;#39;re gonna run with it I think</text>
  <text start="327.9" dur="2.789">it&amp;#39;s gonna blow up I think is also going</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="2.73">to address a lot of these cultural</text>
  <text start="330.689" dur="3.66">issues okay</text>
  <text start="332.25" dur="4.469">and I think that that hope and that that</text>
  <text start="334.349" dur="2.731">taste of capitalism that taste of</text>
  <text start="336.719" dur="3.75">freedom</text>
  <text start="337.08" dur="4.949">those those fundamental Western values I</text>
  <text start="340.469" dur="3.81">think those are going to come back</text>
  <text start="342.029" dur="3.81">swinging and the pendulum is gonna go</text>
  <text start="344.279" dur="3.87">full swing away from all of this</text>
  <text start="345.839" dur="3.961">socialism collectivism fascism all of</text>
  <text start="348.149" dur="4.621">the collectivists you know communist</text>
  <text start="349.8" dur="5.039">ideas because they&amp;#39;re all the same thing</text>
  <text start="352.77" dur="3.78">people are label fascism is the enemy of</text>
  <text start="354.839" dur="3.241">communism well not really it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356.55" dur="3.57">just two sides of the same coin they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="6.69">both authoritarian and dictatorships</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="6.87">okay collectivist authoritarianism so</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="4.44">you know there&amp;#39;s some semantics involved</text>
  <text start="366.99" dur="5.22">but it&amp;#39;s basically the same thing to the</text>
  <text start="369.21" dur="6.299">extent of the effect and impact and it</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="6.109">always leads to suffering now you I</text>
  <text start="375.509" dur="6.12">support everything that Trump does</text>
  <text start="378.319" dur="5.5">especially you know as far as that you</text>
  <text start="381.629" dur="3.56">know the economy goes in limiting the</text>
  <text start="383.819" dur="4.08">government and getting this back to a</text>
  <text start="385.189" dur="4.991">down the spectrum it&amp;#39;s not like a switch</text>
  <text start="387.899" dur="3.591">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a spectrum and I want to get</text>
  <text start="390.18" dur="4.32">us back toward that individualist</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="5.32">limited government maybe no government</text>
  <text start="394.5" dur="4.89">side of the spectrum and I want to do</text>
  <text start="396.81" dur="4.05">that desperately but it can&amp;#39;t be rushed</text>
  <text start="399.39" dur="3.87">people are not ready for it right now if</text>
  <text start="400.86" dur="4.32">we got rid of the government now there</text>
  <text start="403.26" dur="3.48">would be civil war there would be mass</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="3.33">murders there would be a lot of violence</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="3.24">we would deal with it quickly and in</text>
  <text start="408.51" dur="4.44">fact we would actually be much better</text>
  <text start="409.98" dur="5.16">off five ten years down the road for it</text>
  <text start="412.95" dur="3.15">because this issue would be you know</text>
  <text start="415.14" dur="2.67">there would mean there would be no</text>
  <text start="416.1" dur="3.51">government stopping true justice there</text>
  <text start="417.81" dur="4.05">would be some vigilantes out there but</text>
  <text start="419.61" dur="4.05">basically you&amp;#39;d have a lot of these good</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="3.12">guy military and biker types out there</text>
  <text start="423.66" dur="3.36">clearing out the problem very quickly</text>
  <text start="424.98" dur="3.48">hunters would be out there taking out</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="3.57">the anti-fog people who were harassing</text>
  <text start="428.46" dur="3.75">and assaulting and and it would be it</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="3.51">would be very fast and very bloody very</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="3.75">violent and then no one would want to</text>
  <text start="434.1" dur="3.15">ever mess with us again and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.96" dur="3">there at that point there would be no</text>
  <text start="437.25" dur="3.36">government to take over so any foreign</text>
  <text start="438.96" dur="3.72">government would not have a chance to</text>
  <text start="440.61" dur="3.45">try to take us over you know that would</text>
  <text start="442.68" dur="3.33">not a lot of people think wouldn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="444.06" dur="3.81">Warlord&amp;#39;s take over and that&amp;#39;s mises.org</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="3.84">addresses that argument very well just</text>
  <text start="447.87" dur="4.86">just do a google for wouldn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="449.85" dur="5.1">warlords take over but you know this is</text>
  <text start="452.73" dur="4.5">this is my answer I think I think that</text>
  <text start="454.95" dur="4.47">capitalism solves the culture problem</text>
  <text start="457.23" dur="3.99">and I think the capitalism solves the</text>
  <text start="459.42" dur="3.42">you know the the poverty and and</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="2.84">therefore most of the crime problem and</text>
  <text start="462.84" dur="3.99">government causes most of the problems</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="4.45">so I think that anything that will help</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="3.36">us get back toward an appreciation of</text>
  <text start="468.51" dur="4.14">capitalism is going to help us get the</text>
  <text start="470.19" dur="4.83">mindset back toward where we can be</text>
  <text start="472.65" dur="5.22">ready for that kind of thing and that is</text>
  <text start="475.02" dur="4.62">my perspective and that is why I I fly</text>
  <text start="477.87" dur="4.41">the black and yellow colors yellow</text>
  <text start="479.64" dur="6.12">represents a non-violence I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="482.28" dur="5.57">yellow represents private property</text>
  <text start="485.76" dur="5.43">rights and black represents non-violence</text>
  <text start="487.85" dur="4.78">and the non-aggression principle so you</text>
  <text start="491.19" dur="1.74">know look I I encourage you if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="492.63" dur="2.73">curious</text>
  <text start="492.93" dur="4.08">check out the non-aggression principle</text>
  <text start="495.36" dur="3.81">and if you believe in the non-aggression</text>
  <text start="497.01" dur="3.96">principle which I bet you already do you</text>
  <text start="499.17" dur="3.6">know it&amp;#39;s not right to use force against</text>
  <text start="500.97" dur="4.25">other people that disagree with you on</text>
  <text start="502.77" dur="4.32">something if they&amp;#39;re not hurting you</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="3.58">basically the same stuff in the</text>
  <text start="507.09" dur="3.72">Constitution right the Constitution was</text>
  <text start="508.8" dur="3.75">was great in theory it just failed us</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="3.72">and it did and I hate to say that I was</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="4.05">a constitutionalist Ron Paul you know</text>
  <text start="514.53" dur="3.449">limited government kind of guy and I</text>
  <text start="516.6" dur="2.75">think he&amp;#39;s really more voluntary us</text>
  <text start="517.979" dur="5.221">based on what he said in the past but</text>
  <text start="519.35" dur="5.77">you know I just think that that piece of</text>
  <text start="523.2" dur="7.59">paper gave us a false sense of security</text>
  <text start="525.12" dur="7.5">and it failed us so having a reset of</text>
  <text start="530.79" dur="2.19">our country would be great for about 200</text>
  <text start="532.62" dur="1.44">years</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;d be right back to where we are now</text>
