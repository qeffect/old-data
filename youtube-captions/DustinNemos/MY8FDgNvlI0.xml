  <text start="119.49" dur="3.089">people and then kill them and then of</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="3.839">course you won&amp;#39;t get in trouble they</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="6.721">will if they&amp;#39;re at all a right-winger of</text>
  <text start="125.219" dur="6.751">course and then you know you can you can</text>
  <text start="129.3" dur="3.96">assault people and not get in trouble</text>
  <text start="131.97" dur="1.53">for it or if you do you get some sort of</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="2.34">like</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="4.05">probation or something and then if</text>
  <text start="135.6" dur="2.61">you&amp;#39;re really crazy and you try to kill</text>

  <text start="138.21" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re even sort of elevated and private</text>
  <text start="140.46" dur="3.81">discussions among the left is some sort</text>
  <text start="142.14" dur="3.57">of like a quasi hero like yeah I can</text>
  <text start="144.27" dur="2.64">kind of see why I did it I want to kill</text>
  <text start="145.71" dur="4.59">Trump too you know that&amp;#39;s kind of what</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="5.01">they&amp;#39;re thinking so there is going to be</text>
  <text start="150.3" dur="3.15">a lot of this recurring and you may be a</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="3.45">little pissed off and that&amp;#39;s I think</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="5.04">probably a healthy thing in this</text>
  <text start="155.37" dur="6.81">instance so he is back in court again</text>
  <text start="158.49" dur="6.3">another LGBTQ bias allegation he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="162.18" dur="5.16">win this one again eventually but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="164.79" dur="4.62">gonna be you know just constant battle</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="5.369">and strife and and wearing the guy down</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying to do this is</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="4.441">why I&amp;#39;m a big fan of freedom of</text>
  <text start="174.78" dur="3.63">association like if you don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="177.15" dur="3.69">freedom of association you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="5.91">any freedom and unfortunately like right</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="6.51">now my internet has been down up and</text>
  <text start="184.32" dur="4.98">down every 30 minutes or sometimes every</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="3.389">10 minutes or whatever it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="189.3" dur="3.18">spurts they&amp;#39;re doing repairs or</text>
  <text start="190.739" dur="3.991">something and it&amp;#39;s been up and down for</text>
  <text start="192.48" dur="3.42">two almost three days now so it is</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="3.96">difficult for me to get some work done</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="4.5">on on the news and I can still do a lot</text>
  <text start="198.69" dur="5.1">of the research but putting the video</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="5.19">together some of my pages may be down I</text>
  <text start="203.79" dur="5.4">was trying to wait for a moment when I</text>
  <text start="205.59" dur="5.07">had everything back up so it I&amp;#39;ll skip</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="5.85">something every now and then if the page</text>
  <text start="210.66" dur="7.95">is just not up anyway so we also have</text>
  <text start="215.04" dur="7.08">Facebook letting Netflix and Spotify at</text>
  <text start="218.61" dur="4.98">least that we know of right using read</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="3.179">users private messages so they were</text>
  <text start="223.59" dur="3.72">actually able to access everything that</text>
  <text start="225.299" dur="6.391">you&amp;#39;re saying privately to your family</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="7.679">friends kids parents whatever lovers you</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="6.21">know anything and you know that could be</text>
  <text start="234.989" dur="4.891">used for stalking or blackmail purposes</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="4.74">but it could just simply be metadata for</text>
  <text start="239.88" dur="5.13">you know learning how to sell you more</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="6.689">crap to I mean this data is valuable for</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="5.58">a lot of different perspectives and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="249.329" dur="4.291">sure there&amp;#39;s probably more than just</text>
  <text start="250.59" dur="4.35">those two companies we also have this</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="4.56">article is funny because they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="6.299">it peek deep fake remember after queuing</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="5.25">on brought out this talk of videos that</text>
  <text start="261.239" dur="5.941">Hillary Clinton would not want to be</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="5.28">seen the rise of the deep fakes</text>
  <text start="267.18" dur="5.04">started to occur and you started to see</text>
  <text start="268.71" dur="8.13">different outlets MSM outlets give</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="6.9">attention to this idea of having fake</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="5.4">videos that are very realistic almost</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="5.16">convincingly so so it&amp;#39;s I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="282.24" dur="5.04">safe to say apparently all of these</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="4.83">images here are fake people so I think</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s safe to say based on some of this</text>
  <text start="289.11" dur="6.42">technology that we should never again</text>
  <text start="292.05" dur="5.76">trust images or videos without some sort</text>
  <text start="295.53" dur="4.05">of professional diagnostic in there I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="297.81" dur="5.1">not saying we cannot trust our eyes at</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="5.64">all but we definitely can&amp;#39;t go off on</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="3.629">branches or anything like that because</text>
  <text start="305.22" dur="3.36">you know they&amp;#39;re gonna use this against</text>
  <text start="306.539" dur="3.451">us to try to make us look stupid we need</text>
  <text start="308.58" dur="3.179">to be able to verify these images we</text>
  <text start="309.99" dur="4.5">need to learn how to professionally and</text>
  <text start="311.759" dur="5.611">go in and check them or who will do</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="5.399">those kind of services for us who is a</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="4.71">professional so anyway that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="319.889" dur="6.21">important to know because this is a</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="5.67">perfect tool to - so endless confusion</text>
  <text start="326.099" dur="5.13">and doubt within a movement like ours</text>
  <text start="327.75" dur="5.13">which is already having to play catch up</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="3.421">on all this information and piece it all</text>
  <text start="332.88" dur="5.52">together like a puzzle with missing</text>
  <text start="334.65" dur="5.91">pieces we also have Trump ordering full</text>
  <text start="338.4" dur="5.4">withdrawal from Syria after declaring</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="5.31">victory over Isis some are saying he may</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="4.109">not even be able to do that but well I</text>
  <text start="345.87" dur="4.74">think he can and I think he should</text>
  <text start="347.909" dur="4.051">I&amp;#39;ve recently commented that we should</text>
  <text start="350.61" dur="3.989">probably get out of Syria there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="351.96" dur="5.04">point being there we also have a lot of</text>
  <text start="354.599" dur="5.1">goldman sachs talk in this this news</text>
  <text start="357" dur="5.28">chain here we also have a goldman sachs</text>
  <text start="359.699" dur="4.741">vice president former pleads guilty to</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="5.49">insider trading</text>
  <text start="364.44" dur="6.33">so this is kind of just one little thing</text>
  <text start="367.77" dur="4.739">that happened and a hundred and thirty</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="3.69">thousand and a legal profits this is</text>
  <text start="372.509" dur="4.41">probably like chump change to these guys</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="4.32">so it&amp;#39;s just interesting to see that</text>
  <text start="376.919" dur="3.271">Goldman Sachs is in the news so often</text>
  <text start="378.78" dur="3.15">lately and we&amp;#39;re gonna talk about more</text>
  <text start="380.19" dur="3.18">of that because Goldman Sachs in my</text>
  <text start="381.93" dur="3.63">opinion are pretty high up the darn</text>
  <text start="383.37" dur="4.53">pyramid I mean they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re very high</text>
  <text start="385.56" dur="4.52">level maybe not quite leaders of the</text>
  <text start="387.9" dur="5.28">world level but they&amp;#39;re very high level</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="5.949">players and they seem to be doing a lot</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="5.489">of evil in the world so speaking of</text>
  <text start="396.029" dur="4.921">which I&amp;#39;ve reported recently about how</text>
  <text start="398.669" dur="4.501">Goldman Sachs basically who</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="4.98">with a corrupt leader of Malaysia to</text>
  <text start="403.17" dur="7.05">scam people out of all this money</text>
  <text start="405.93" dur="5.79">billions of dollars and now Malaysia is</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="3.45">going after Goldman but they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="411.72" dur="3.81">going after them in terms of just fees</text>
  <text start="413.67" dur="4.08">they want someone to go to jail they are</text>
  <text start="415.53" dur="4.86">actually demanding people physically</text>
  <text start="417.75" dur="6.29">show up they do have sort of a British</text>
  <text start="420.39" dur="6.39">common law court similar to our own but</text>
  <text start="424.04" dur="4.24">this is very interesting to see some of</text>
  <text start="426.78" dur="3.39">these high-level players may actually go</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="3.21">to like jail or at least they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="430.17" dur="3.74">to pursue it I don&amp;#39;t think the line</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="4.02">should show up I mean Goldman Sachs</text>
  <text start="433.91" dur="3.22">versus Malaysia</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="4.05">I mean Malaysia&amp;#39;s probably got nothing</text>
  <text start="437.13" dur="3.9">on these guys they&amp;#39;re way bigger but you</text>
  <text start="439.56" dur="4.92">know many corporations are larger than</text>
  <text start="441.03" dur="6.36">the countries in terms of you know power</text>
  <text start="444.48" dur="5.37">or cash they&amp;#39;re going after them so</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="6.27">that&amp;#39;s great we want Goldman Sachs you</text>
  <text start="449.85" dur="7.05">know we also have Senate passing oh did</text>
  <text start="453.66" dur="4.77">you fall asleep poor thing sometimes she</text>
  <text start="456.9" dur="4.47">goes to sleep and then wakes up and gets</text>
  <text start="458.43" dur="5.16">scared we also have Senate passing a</text>
  <text start="461.37" dur="4.8">stopgap temporary couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="463.59" dur="3.99">funding basically I think this is just</text>
  <text start="466.17" dur="2.97">to get us over to Christmas and past</text>
  <text start="467.58" dur="3.06">like it let&amp;#39;s get through the holidays</text>
  <text start="469.14" dur="3.78">without all the drama people wanting to</text>
  <text start="470.64" dur="3.84">be with their families and stuff and</text>
  <text start="472.92" dur="3.15">that that seems kind of like the thing</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="3.21">Trump might do before we really get into</text>
  <text start="476.07" dur="4.53">the fight of next year I think next year</text>
  <text start="477.69" dur="4.71">is gonna really just come out I think</text>
  <text start="480.6" dur="3.6">after Christmas it&amp;#39;s on right I think</text>
  <text start="482.4" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s gonna come out swinging and I think</text>
  <text start="484.2" dur="4.77">Trump is gonna hit really hard because</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re somewhat lately he seems a little</text>
  <text start="488.97" dur="4.2">bit ineffectual maybe I don&amp;#39;t know maybe</text>
  <text start="491.73" dur="5.09">I&amp;#39;m just being a little pessimistic I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="493.17" dur="8.1">been reading too much MSM lately but</text>
  <text start="496.82" dur="6.97">yeah so we&amp;#39;ll get through this you know</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="5.25">no shut down for now and then it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="503.79" dur="4.77">back into a fight after Christmas that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="506.52" dur="5.19">fine with me I guess Russia completes</text>
  <text start="508.56" dur="6.96">rearming Crimea with s400 missiles to</text>
  <text start="511.71" dur="7.23">neutralize possible threats so Crimea</text>
  <text start="515.52" dur="5.52">will now be protected from you know</text>
  <text start="518.94" dur="4.44">air-to-air missiles or aircraft that</text>
  <text start="521.04" dur="4.14">kind of thing and the s400 has been</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="5.15">pretty effective pretty strong in that</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="6.63">area so Russia is is getting ready</text>
  <text start="528.53" dur="4.359">basically protecting its its flanks at</text>
  <text start="531.81" dur="2.819">this point</text>
  <text start="532.889" dur="4.831">and when we&amp;#39;re up there of course NATO</text>
  <text start="534.629" dur="4.77">and and others just trying to start a</text>
  <text start="537.72" dur="3.989">fight with Russia I really hope it</text>
  <text start="539.399" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t come to that I really I think if</text>
  <text start="541.709" dur="2.761">they if it does come to that Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.089" dur="2.84">gonna hit us hard because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="544.47" dur="4.2">want to fight in their country again</text>
  <text start="545.929" dur="4.6">climate change blamed for doubling of</text>
  <text start="548.67" dur="3.629">winter related deaths in Wales but</text>
  <text start="550.529" dur="3.3">here&amp;#39;s why people are really dying and</text>
  <text start="552.299" dur="4.08">if you read through this it actually</text>
  <text start="553.829" dur="4.711">turns out people are really dying in</text>
  <text start="556.379" dur="4.38">much larger quantities through the</text>
  <text start="558.54" dur="5.909">winter months the cold months in the</text>
  <text start="560.759" dur="6.75">cold areas because energy costs are so</text>
  <text start="564.449" dur="5.01">darn high so global warming will of</text>
  <text start="567.509" dur="5.19">course break your legs by making energy</text>
  <text start="569.459" dur="4.92">costs way higher you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="572.699" dur="3.08">half of what the policies are there it</text>

  <text start="1344.09" dur="4.559">covered this and the last things I was</text>
  <text start="1347.33" dur="6.3">going to go through a couple other</text>
  <text start="1348.649" dur="7.41">things Obama kind of talking about how</text>
  <text start="1353.63" dur="3.99">Isis was a generational struggle and</text>
  <text start="1356.059" dur="3.291">then Trump just kicked the crap out of</text>
  <text start="1357.62" dur="4.649">them in a year too and then it&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="1359.35" dur="4.709">and then also recently I talked about</text>
  <text start="1362.269" dur="3.931">something called the moral foundations</text>
  <text start="1364.059" dur="3.85">and I found the website I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1366.2" dur="3.479">remember what it was called I just sort</text>
  <text start="1367.909" dur="3.961">of described it as the spectrums in</text>
  <text start="1369.679" dur="4.531">which people operate when they are</text>
  <text start="1371.87" dur="4.289">making their their judgment decisions</text>
  <text start="1374.21" dur="4.77">you know like very different very</text>
  <text start="1376.159" dur="4.86">different across like sexes or like</text>
  <text start="1378.98" dur="3.99">political paradigms and left very very</text>
  <text start="1381.019" dur="3.931">different from the right there&amp;#39;s six of</text>
  <text start="1382.97" dur="3.99">these things that I know of of them</text>
  <text start="1384.95" dur="3.51">primary moral foundations I wish I could</text>
  <text start="1386.96" dur="6.03">show you and you can check it out on</text>
  <text start="1388.46" dur="7.17">moral foundations or very cool stuff and</text>
  <text start="1392.99" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s a very short read just that front</text>
  <text start="1395.63" dur="3.389">page there and it&amp;#39;ll help you understand</text>
  <text start="1397.73" dur="2.88">a lot of the difference in thinking</text>
  <text start="1399.019" dur="5.37">between the left and the right young and</text>
  <text start="1400.61" dur="5.939">the old Christians versus not man versus</text>
  <text start="1404.389" dur="3.691">women because everyone has these sort of</text>
  <text start="1406.549" dur="5.161">moral foundations that they tend to go</text>
  <text start="1408.08" dur="4.829">into and for the for the Liberals I</text>
  <text start="1411.71" dur="4.49">think there&amp;#39;s two or three that they</text>
  <text start="1412.909" dur="6.24">actually actively use out of the six and</text>
  <text start="1416.2" dur="5.439">then for conservatives they use the</text>
  <text start="1419.149" dur="4.951">primary five but they don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1421.639" dur="4.621">sixth one and then four more like</text>
  <text start="1424.1" dur="4.41">libertarians or voluntarist types I</text>
  <text start="1426.26" dur="5.34">think they actually in end up using five</text>
  <text start="1428.51" dur="6.18">to six but they leave out I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1431.6" dur="5.88">remember which one it is in terms of one</text>
  <text start="1434.69" dur="4.32">of the first five so it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="1437.48" dur="3.449">interesting they&amp;#39;re not that long over</text>
  <text start="1439.01" dur="4.32">Reid I think it&amp;#39;s fascinating and it&amp;#39;s</text>
