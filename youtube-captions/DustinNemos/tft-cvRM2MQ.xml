  <text start="273.27" dur="5.37">Legal Defense Fund org and the reason we</text>
  <text start="276.57" dur="4.8">did that is because when he resigned</text>

  <text start="288.84" dur="5.04">like year but early on we knew that this</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="3.54">was not going to this was not going to</text>
  <text start="293.88" dur="4.259">stop in fact it was going to get worse</text>

  <text start="298.139" dur="4.381">enormous sum of money and I can tell you</text>
  <text start="300.51" dur="5.159">it&amp;#39;s in the seven figures well into the</text>
  <text start="302.52" dur="5.34">same seven figures was so we knew that</text>
  <text start="305.669" dur="4.921">that that he wasn&amp;#39;t going to be able to</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.71">handle this financially we did some</text>
  <text start="310.59" dur="3.96">research into creating legal defense</text>
  <text start="312.57" dur="6.21">fund he&amp;#39;d seen it you know in the past</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="5.64">and he really was reluctant to do to do</text>
  <text start="318.78" dur="2.91">a legal defense fund because he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="320.19" dur="4.44">want this guy&amp;#39;s a three-star general</text>

  <text start="324.63" dur="3.42">want to you know be looking like he was</text>
  <text start="326.82" dur="4.14">pandering or anything like that but</text>
  <text start="328.05" dur="5.91">nobody nobody&amp;#39;s prepared financially</text>
  <text start="330.96" dur="4.8">morally or spiritually for what he you</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="4.74">know what him and his wife were gonna go</text>

  <text start="1769.36" dur="6.51">that the fact that and the only reason</text>
  <text start="1772.12" dur="5.16">that people on the left are people that</text>
  <text start="1775.87" dur="5.55">are kind of on the fence about this</text>
  <text start="1777.28" dur="6.3">maybe independent are even still buying</text>
  <text start="1781.42" dur="6">into this is because the mainstream</text>

  <text start="1866.83" dur="4.65">what are your thoughts on them I think</text>
  <text start="1868.93" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s important that justice is served</text>
  <text start="1871.48" dur="5.61">and justice is served equally if we are</text>
  <text start="1875.14" dur="5.18">going to be ripped if we are going to</text>
  <text start="1877.09" dur="7.26">survive as a constitutional republic Wow</text>
  <text start="1880.32" dur="5.95">we are either a nation of laws or we are</text>

  <text start="1886.27" dur="5.97">thing that has kept this crazy country</text>
  <text start="1888.85" dur="5.88">together for the last 250 years or so is</text>

  <text start="1908.2" dur="4.89">Durham who he appointed and he</text>
  <text start="1911.02" dur="5.1">specifically appointed Durham because</text>

  <text start="1932.86" dur="4.02">think we&amp;#39;re gonna see some things that</text>
  <text start="1934.06" dur="6">we were not expecting and the only thing</text>
  <text start="1936.88" dur="5.31">I can say is justice must be served if</text>
  <text start="1940.06" dur="5.28">we are to survive as a constitutional</text>

  <text start="2126.69" dur="4.32">in your your opinion what do you think</text>
  <text start="2129.21" dur="3.93">he lost I can tell you this that he</text>
  <text start="2131.01" dur="3.31">follows all of them he follows many of</text>
  <text start="2133.14" dur="5.32">them he&amp;#39;s reading and</text>
  <text start="2134.32" dur="7.17">thing that you&amp;#39;re producing he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2138.46" dur="6.21">enthusiastic about all the work that</text>
  <text start="2141.49" dur="6.12">you&amp;#39;re all doing we share information</text>
  <text start="2144.67" dur="4.64">back and forth on articles and things we</text>
  <text start="2147.61" dur="4.62">see a lot of it coming from</text>
  <text start="2149.31" dur="4.48">quote-unquote digital soldiers so he</text>
  <text start="2152.23" dur="3.18">would say keep fighting he would say</text>
  <text start="2153.79" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t stop</text>
  <text start="2155.41" dur="5.97">find those fight against censorship and</text>
  <text start="2159.04" dur="5.37">find those platforms out there let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2161.38" dur="4.8">build a platform that that&amp;#39;s truly you</text>
  <text start="2164.41" dur="4.5">know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s truly open sourced</text>
  <text start="2166.18" dur="4.95">and truly talking about the truth even</text>
  <text start="2168.91" dur="5.73">if the truth hurts even if the truth</text>
  <text start="2171.13" dur="7.2">hurts our side we cannot be immune to</text>
  <text start="2174.64" dur="5.85">self-criticism and I mean that uh I mean</text>
  <text start="2178.33" dur="3.78">about that about the mega movement we</text>
  <text start="2180.49" dur="3.21">need to be open-minded about some of the</text>
  <text start="2182.11" dur="3.33">stupid things that we do from time to</text>
  <text start="2183.7" dur="3.93">time yeah we&amp;#39;ve had people they get</text>
  <text start="2185.44" dur="3.75">angry and mean on social media and such</text>
  <text start="2187.63" dur="3.15">we should kill them with kindness I mean</text>
  <text start="2189.19" dur="3.71">there are examples you&amp;#39;re right yeah</text>
  <text start="2190.78" dur="5.94">yeah but I also think that you know a</text>
  <text start="2192.9" dur="5.56">mistake is a mistake a bad decision is a</text>
  <text start="2196.72" dur="2.43">bad decision let&amp;#39;s minimize our bad</text>
  <text start="2198.46" dur="3.12">decision</text>
  <text start="2199.15" dur="5.76">our bad decisions and maximize our good</text>
  <text start="2201.58" dur="5.46">decisions but keep fighting and keep</text>
  <text start="2204.91" dur="4.5">fighting to get the truth out there</text>
  <text start="2207.04" dur="3.96">because this is a great country and I</text>
  <text start="2209.41" dur="2.97">think we need to do this for our</text>
  <text start="2211" dur="5.7">children and for our grandchildren</text>
  <text start="2212.38" dur="7.32">otherwise it is it is amazing how</text>
  <text start="2216.7" dur="4.38">quickly all of this can evaporate we</text>
  <text start="2219.7" dur="3.18">could easily lose this country and I</text>
  <text start="2221.08" dur="3.54">think that was one of the things that</text>
  <text start="2222.88" dur="3.84">general Flynn was very concerned about I</text>
  <text start="2224.62" dur="5.58">remember came out to visit me when I was</text>

  <text start="2256.03" dur="4.95">Trump was elected and the tide got</text>
  <text start="2258.04" dur="5.37">turned and at least if it did anything</text>
  <text start="2260.98" dur="5.22">had put a stopgap on the direction the</text>
  <text start="2263.41" dur="4.23">country was going and here we are you</text>
