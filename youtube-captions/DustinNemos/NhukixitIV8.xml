  <text start="52.4" dur="4.319">fake news you&amp;#39;re gonna get erased from</text>
  <text start="55.129" dur="4.2">the internet these days so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="56.719" dur="5.731">difficult even for large channels to get</text>
  <text start="59.329" dur="5.671">their word across to get any sort of any</text>
  <text start="62.45" dur="4.41">sort of counter facts out there to the</text>
  <text start="65" dur="5.039">official propaganda coming out of big</text>

  <text start="79.22" dur="4.47">will to bring influencers together to</text>
  <text start="81.41" dur="4.849">try to bring as many of us independent</text>
  <text start="83.69" dur="5.359">voices and you know journalists authors</text>
  <text start="86.259" dur="5.591">silenced social media influencers</text>

  <text start="97.7" dur="3.72">group that you might think that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="99.14" dur="4.65">censored you know even folks on the left</text>
  <text start="101.42" dur="4.379">event sensor it&amp;#39;s a nonpartisan issue</text>
  <text start="103.79" dur="4.23">and the attempt is to bring as many of</text>
  <text start="105.799" dur="2.971">us together as possible to do something</text>
  <text start="108.02" dur="3.029">about it</text>
  <text start="108.77" dur="5.4">now the first time we had a online</text>
  <text start="111.049" dur="5.671">meetup or meeting I called it a digital</text>
  <text start="114.17" dur="5.4">war summit for censorship for stop it</text>
  <text start="116.72" dur="4.92">burning now what we did is we had just</text>
  <text start="119.57" dur="4.32">over a dozen people show up now all</text>
  <text start="121.64" dur="4.17">totaled it was over two million people</text>
  <text start="123.89" dur="4.439">that we could reach with that small</text>
  <text start="125.81" dur="4.47">group of influential types these are you</text>
  <text start="128.329" dur="3.421">know important people whose opinions</text>
  <text start="130.28" dur="3.929">matter to millions of people out there</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="4.11">total and that&amp;#39;s a pretty big number</text>
  <text start="134.209" dur="5.011">we&amp;#39;re starting to get into the millions</text>
  <text start="135.86" dur="5.64">of reach the second meeting we had over</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="3.15">30 people showed up it was very</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="3.269">impressive</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="5.55">we actually tripled our numbers within a</text>
  <text start="144.769" dur="6.771">month that is exponential growth that my</text>
  <text start="147.92" dur="7.38">friends is momentum so the next step is</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="5.83">to take this campaign to the third you</text>
  <text start="155.3" dur="2.64">know conference where I expect there to</text>
  <text start="157.37" dur="3.15">be a</text>
  <text start="157.94" dur="4.44">a hundred influential people and the</text>
  <text start="160.52" dur="3.6">reach within the millions if you combine</text>
  <text start="162.38" dur="4.5">the reach from the first in a second</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="4.74">combined group we somewhere in the range</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="4.8">of about forty influencers with five</text>
  <text start="168.86" dur="5.07">million potential subs out there that</text>
  <text start="171.68" dur="4.23">could hear the message of censorship so</text>
  <text start="173.93" dur="3.63">once we&amp;#39;re on the same page and we can</text>
  <text start="175.91" dur="3.84">sort of communicate and we can bring</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="3.72">attention to the same issues we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="179.75" dur="3.3">have a movement and that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="3.54">that you know I&amp;#39;ve been working on some</text>
  <text start="183.05" dur="3.12">of us have been working on very long now</text>
  <text start="184.82" dur="4.44">behind the scenes and it&amp;#39;s good to see</text>
  <text start="186.17" dur="5.28">that finally take off but the goal what</text>
  <text start="189.26" dur="4.38">do we do with this movement right well</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="4.38">one thing is we could fundraise and we</text>
  <text start="193.64" dur="4.65">can do a class action against big tech</text>
  <text start="195.83" dur="4.35">possibly Google possibly you to possibly</text>
  <text start="198.29" dur="3.57">some of the others and we would need to</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="3.96">fundraise it but many hands make light</text>
  <text start="201.86" dur="3.78">work yes it would take a couple of</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="4.08">hundred thousand dollars to get that</text>
  <text start="205.64" dur="4.32">started possibly millions going down but</text>
  <text start="208.22" dur="4.02">if we have ten twenty million people</text>
  <text start="209.96" dur="4.02">within our potential reach it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="212.24" dur="4.92">expensive anymore we can take them on</text>
  <text start="213.98" dur="5.19">together we can even beat them so there</text>
  <text start="217.16" dur="4.17">are options there&amp;#39;s other potential</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="3.66">legal options that we can explore and a</text>
  <text start="221.33" dur="3.69">big part of what we&amp;#39;re doing here is</text>
  <text start="222.83" dur="3.57">just general education getting people</text>
  <text start="225.02" dur="3.36">that are being banned and censored on</text>
  <text start="226.4" dur="4.32">the same conversation to to the same</text>
  <text start="228.38" dur="3.78">table if you will sort of a roundtable</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="3.6">coalition where we can have a</text>
  <text start="232.16" dur="4.23">conversation and maybe we don&amp;#39;t always</text>
  <text start="234.32" dur="4.8">agree on other things but I think we can</text>
  <text start="236.39" dur="5.43">all agree on freedom of speech so the</text>
  <text start="239.12" dur="5.01">next step is to build awareness to raise</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="3.84">awareness get this thing to a national</text>
  <text start="244.13" dur="4.17">level to get everyone talking about</text>
  <text start="245.66" dur="4.38">censorship to some level and once we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.3" dur="4.02">at that point hundreds of influencers</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="4.74">have you know taken an interest and</text>
  <text start="252.32" dur="4.83">millions of potential people out there</text>
  <text start="254.78" dur="4.53">following this thing that&amp;#39;s when we can</text>
  <text start="257.15" dur="4.23">get together make the decision do we sue</text>
  <text start="259.31" dur="5.97">do we take them on in the courts do we</text>
  <text start="261.38" dur="6.72">do we go against Goliath so that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re headed I&amp;#39;m very proud and humbled</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="4.65">to be a small part of that you know all</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="4.47">I&amp;#39;ve really done you know for my part is</text>
  <text start="272.75" dur="4.14">to try to make some introductions to try</text>
  <text start="275.09" dur="3.78">to make some connections you know do</text>
  <text start="276.89" dur="4.32">some emails and some follow-ups and some</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="4.5">networking because I do believe that at</text>
  <text start="281.21" dur="4.709">the end of the day we have what we need</text>
  <text start="283.37" dur="3.95">we have more than we know in fact and</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="3.411">it&amp;#39;s just a matter of</text>
  <text start="287.32" dur="4.14">working together do they have us divided</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="3.87">because I do believe we are stronger</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="4.08">together you know I don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="293.2" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;m in competition with any of the other</text>
  <text start="295.54" dur="4.41">independent media voices out there I</text>
  <text start="298" dur="3.81">believe that I&amp;#39;m in competition with</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="3.99">fake news and there&amp;#39;s plenty of market</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="4.89">share left to go cuz these guys have all</text>
  <text start="303.94" dur="4.62">the billion-dollar funding and and you</text>
  <text start="306.7" dur="4.05">know contracts with airports things like</text>
  <text start="308.56" dur="5.01">that across the world so they can get</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="5.7">plenty of traffic whereas we&amp;#39;re frozen</text>
  <text start="313.57" dur="6.03">out where we&amp;#39;re drowned out were drained</text>
  <text start="316.45" dur="5.58">out we&amp;#39;re bit burned out from the</text>
  <text start="319.6" dur="4.98">internet so stop the digital censorship</text>
  <text start="322.03" dur="4.38">stop us being erased before President</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="3.65">Trump is standing alone against</text>
  <text start="326.41" dur="4.85">everything that they&amp;#39;re throwing at him</text>
  <text start="328.23" dur="5.29">and that&amp;#39;s it for now I want you guys to</text>

  <text start="337.45" dur="2.76">gonna have more interviews on other</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="3.45">platforms where we&amp;#39;re talking about this</text>
  <text start="340.21" dur="3.48">bringing attention to it and we&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="342.04" dur="3.81">those videos here on the website for</text>

  <text start="350.86" dur="2.88">and spread the word you&amp;#39;re the tip of</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="4.35">the spear when it comes to censorship</text>
  <text start="353.74" dur="5.85">and freedom of speech that puts you on</text>
  <text start="356.53" dur="4.95">the very edge of the fight that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="359.59" dur="4.62">having now in the build-up to 2020</text>
  <text start="361.48" dur="4.56">you&amp;#39;re sharing the links you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="366.04" dur="3.72">influencer influencer then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="368.14" dur="3.6">spreading the word is even a bigger deal</text>
  <text start="369.76" dur="3.81">I mean but telling other influencers</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="3.63">about it maybe you don&amp;#39;t have a big</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="3.45">audience yourself but maybe you share a</text>
  <text start="375.37" dur="3.57">link and you never know how far that</text>
  <text start="377.02" dur="5.85">link is gonna go especially if you share</text>
  <text start="378.94" dur="5.4">it with other VIP independent media you</text>
  <text start="382.87" dur="2.85">know just people who have a large reach</text>
