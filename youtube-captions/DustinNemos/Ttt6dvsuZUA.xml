  <text start="1.55" dur="6.34">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="4.29" dur="4.59">most of destiny most calm there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="7.89" dur="3.499">of interesting things I want to talk</text>
  <text start="8.88" dur="6.719">about so let&amp;#39;s begin</text>
  <text start="11.389" dur="7.841">so one let&amp;#39;s do some good news</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="5.491">CNN&amp;#39;s ratings have taken another plunge</text>
  <text start="19.23" dur="4.01">this time a double-digit plunge I mean</text>
  <text start="21.09" dur="5.22">we already know that their their whole</text>
  <text start="23.24" dur="4.72">ratings is imploding but you know the</text>
  <text start="26.31" dur="3.809">garden Channel is more popular than CNN</text>
  <text start="27.96" dur="4.83">despite the fact they are contractually</text>
  <text start="30.119" dur="4.261">obligated with airports and other places</text>
  <text start="32.79" dur="4.41">around the world bars things like that</text>
  <text start="34.38" dur="4.499">can&amp;#39;t even turn them off you know they</text>
  <text start="37.2" dur="3.78">have you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re bundled</text>
  <text start="38.879" dur="4.411">into the cable if you&amp;#39;re still paying</text>
  <text start="40.98" dur="3.78">for cable I encourage you to use the</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="3.6">internet instead and just please stop</text>
  <text start="44.76" dur="3.72">because you know that&amp;#39;s one of the ways</text>
  <text start="46.89" dur="3.66">that the fake news is earning a profit</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="6.39">and paying themselves these exorbitant</text>
  <text start="50.55" dur="6.509">fees to lie to us the DOJ is also</text>
  <text start="54.87" dur="3.63">disclosing that no FISA Court hearings</text>
  <text start="57.059" dur="3.84">were held on the Carter page warrants</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="4.59">okay this they approved the Trump they</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="4.23">rubber-stamped the Trump spying with no</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="4.319">proof of any crimes at all</text>
  <text start="65.129" dur="4.381">some are theorizing and I feel like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="67.409" dur="4.291">this has some merit to it some are</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="4.89">theorizing that Loretta Lynch has AG</text>
  <text start="71.7" dur="4.77">used her emergency powers to actually do</text>
  <text start="74.4" dur="3.57">a seven-day warrant and they have to</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="4.2">justify it within seven days to the</text>
  <text start="77.97" dur="3.93">court and then she just kind of used it</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="3.15">and then they went back to the court</text>
  <text start="81.9" dur="4.02">later and gave him some kind of crap to</text>
  <text start="83.82" dur="6.06">get the approval I guess but maybe she</text>
  <text start="85.92" dur="7.019">was behind it herself directly we also</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="4.77">have try there&amp;#39;s gonna be a couple</text>
  <text start="92.939" dur="3.39">things I&amp;#39;ve got a spaced out but Trump</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="5">is actually saying about Facebook and</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="5.821">Amazon and Google they may be in a very</text>
  <text start="99.65" dur="4.03">antitrust situation okay</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="3.45">he&amp;#39;s not saying there they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="103.68" dur="4.439">held accountable to antitrust laws were</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="3.54">broken up but you know this is you know</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="2.701">how Trump is you know how these things</text>
  <text start="109.14" dur="3.509">work they drop it into the public</text>
  <text start="110.82" dur="3.24">consciousness they get the the people</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="3.51">ready for it mentally and then it</text>
  <text start="114.06" dur="4.58">actually happens or sometimes it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="5.28">a threat that&amp;#39;s what could happen</text>
  <text start="118.64" dur="6.369">interestingly Trump is also calling for</text>
  <text start="121.439" dur="6.39">the telecom giant AT&amp;amp;T to fire the CNN</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="7.131">boss Jeff Zucker an evil diminutive</text>
  <text start="127.829" dur="6.591">little man basically a propaganda artist</text>
  <text start="132.14" dur="4.65">also Trump is threatening to pull out of</text>
  <text start="134.42" dur="3.96">the World Trade Organization if they</text>
  <text start="136.79" dur="3.15">don&amp;#39;t shape up that&amp;#39;s pretty interesting</text>
  <text start="138.38" dur="3.99">too I mean we know he&amp;#39;ll do it he pulled</text>
  <text start="139.94" dur="4.41">out of NAFTA and now we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re signing</text>
  <text start="142.37" dur="3.75">something with Mexico we&amp;#39;ve got a new</text>
  <text start="144.35" dur="3.48">deal and he&amp;#39;s saying once again Mexico</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="2.7">is gonna pay for the wall probably</text>
  <text start="147.83" dur="3.03">through the deal you know we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="148.82" dur="5.25">have a win-win deal and the profit will</text>
  <text start="150.86" dur="4.56">probably cover the wall in Canada it may</text>
  <text start="154.07" dur="3.24">be just get left out you know they</text>
  <text start="155.42" dur="3.62">haven&amp;#39;t they haven&amp;#39;t come to the table</text>
  <text start="157.31" dur="3.48">and made a deal like we want them to so</text>
  <text start="159.04" dur="2.89">you know these countries have been</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="2.61">taking advantage of the US for a long</text>
  <text start="161.93" dur="3.48">time nothing against the people they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.4" dur="4.29">great people in both countries in many</text>
  <text start="165.41" dur="4.92">cases but you know the government&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="167.69" dur="5.4">the the whole system was really rigged</text>
  <text start="170.33" dur="5.28">to to screw America so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.09" dur="6.17">interesting to see that happen now let</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="3.65">me correct my notes here a little bit</text>
  <text start="179.5" dur="4.48">this this is just a cultural thing this</text>
  <text start="182" dur="4.43">is not a big news event but one judge is</text>
  <text start="183.98" dur="4.83">ordering these virtue signalers on</text>
  <text start="186.43" dur="3.85">GoFundMe who raised four hundred and</text>
  <text start="188.81" dur="3.81">three thousand dollars to help a</text>
  <text start="190.28" dur="6.15">homeless vet they&amp;#39;re ordering them to</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="5.64">return what&amp;#39;s left of the money short</text>
  <text start="196.43" dur="5.73">story is that this homeless guy gave</text>
  <text start="198.26" dur="5.49">this girl his last 20 bucks to get her</text>
  <text start="202.16" dur="4.17">home she ran out of gas she was stranded</text>
  <text start="203.75" dur="4.23">and they returned the favor by trying to</text>
  <text start="206.33" dur="4.2">start up a GoFundMe to help him earn</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="4.41">some money they raised it was like a 10</text>
  <text start="210.53" dur="3.06">or 20 thousand dollar goal or something</text>

  <text start="544.27" dur="4.17">try to meet with each other to get</text>

  <text start="548.44" dur="3.6">lack of the ability to secretly</text>
  <text start="549.88" dur="3.72">communicate I guess because they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="557.5" dur="4.35">basically where it&amp;#39;s at or his spare</text>
  <text start="559.03" dur="5.7">bedrooms or something I don&amp;#39;t know we</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="5.19">also have and this is a cultural thing</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="4.14">this is not a big news thing but I think</text>
  <text start="567.04" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s a beginning of a trend and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="568.87" dur="5.07">you know I&amp;#39;m a little worried here so a</text>
  <text start="571.42" dur="6.15">pedophile who was out on bail</text>
  <text start="573.94" dur="6.24">they found his decapitated corpse with</text>
  <text start="577.57" dur="5.91">the head cut off on the judges doorstep</text>
  <text start="580.18" dur="4.98">after the bail hearing all right this</text>
  <text start="583.48" dur="3.75">stuff is gonna continue to happen I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="585.16" dur="3.93">not encouraging it but it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="587.23" dur="4.47">continue to happen and this is the first</text>
  <text start="589.09" dur="3.6">probably of many the first that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="591.7" dur="3.09">heard of I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s been other</text>
  <text start="592.69" dur="4.05">similar situations but these things that</text>
  <text start="594.79" dur="4.05">get big attention like this you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="596.74" dur="3.72">have copycats you can be like well you</text>
  <text start="598.84" dur="2.91">know it&amp;#39;s about time the pedophiles are</text>
  <text start="600.46" dur="2.31">getting away with it and now people are</text>
  <text start="601.75" dur="3.3">gonna start taking it into their own</text>
  <text start="602.77" dur="4.32">hands and and folks murder is the</text>
  <text start="605.05" dur="3.03">easiest crime to get away with I mean if</text>
  <text start="607.09" dur="3.45">you do it correctly</text>
  <text start="608.08" dur="4.41">it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s difficult to catch people</text>
  <text start="610.54" dur="3.39">and murder now it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="612.49" dur="3.54">of the reasons why and because it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="613.93" dur="4.02">important in general situations that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="4.04">why it&amp;#39;s got such a stiff penalty to go</text>
  <text start="617.95" dur="4.32">with it you know that&amp;#39;s why there is no</text>
  <text start="620.07" dur="4.06">as far as I know in every state there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="622.27" dur="3.39">no statute of limitations things like</text>
  <text start="624.13" dur="3.6">that for murder it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a big crime</text>
  <text start="625.66" dur="3.24">but happens to be one that&amp;#39;s easy the</text>
  <text start="627.73" dur="2.82">way with people are going to continue to</text>
  <text start="628.9" dur="3.17">do this I&amp;#39;m not encouraging violence or</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="4.38">anything like that I&amp;#39;m just saying</text>
  <text start="632.07" dur="5.14">trends I spot trends you know it&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="634.93" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s part of what I do from the</text>
  <text start="637.21" dur="3.78">investment perspective and from the news</text>
  <text start="638.62" dur="5.37">perspective so I think that this will</text>
  <text start="640.99" dur="5.22">continue unless we get a lot more like</text>
  <text start="643.99" dur="4.2">visible action and I don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="646.21" dur="4.17">happening because you know we can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="648.19" dur="4.2">visible action when the MSM is blocking</text>
  <text start="650.38" dur="4.26">all the visibility things are happening</text>
  <text start="652.39" dur="4.74">pedophiles are being rounded up but you</text>
  <text start="654.64" dur="3.99">know there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there</text>
  <text start="657.13" dur="2.82">they&amp;#39;re very angry about these things</text>
  <text start="658.63" dur="2.58">you know maybe they&amp;#39;ve been involved</text>
  <text start="659.95" dur="2.88">maybe they know someone who is involved</text>
  <text start="661.21" dur="3.72">you know there&amp;#39;s you you hear those</text>
  <text start="662.83" dur="3.6">stories sometimes about a father</text>
  <text start="664.93" dur="4.11">saw one recently where a guy was in the</text>
  <text start="666.43" dur="4.29">store and he was trying to like snap a</text>
  <text start="669.04" dur="3">picture up a girl&amp;#39;s skirt and the dad</text>
  <text start="670.72" dur="2.58">comes over there and like smacks a</text>
  <text start="672.04" dur="2.31">cellphone out of his hand and like kicks</text>
  <text start="673.3" dur="3.78">him or something like I was</text>
  <text start="674.35" dur="3.929">I loved that dad for that I mean maybe</text>
  <text start="677.08" dur="2.699">he would have gotten assault charge</text>
  <text start="678.279" dur="3.651">maybe not but he probably would have</text>
  <text start="679.779" dur="5.671">been in jail smiling the whole damn time</text>
  <text start="681.93" dur="8.23">so this kind of stuff you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="685.45" dur="6.15">natural to to go after the monsters you</text>
  <text start="690.16" dur="3">know and there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out</text>
  <text start="691.6" dur="4.53">there with you know red blood in them</text>
  <text start="693.16" dur="4.59">and they they feel this very strongly</text>
  <text start="696.13" dur="5.07">like I said I&amp;#39;m not encouraging violence</text>
  <text start="697.75" dur="6.779">but I do see a trend here at least the</text>
  <text start="701.2" dur="5.16">beginning potential of one interestingly</text>
  <text start="704.529" dur="3.68">from the John McCain and I talked about</text>
  <text start="706.36" dur="4.05">McCain a little bit with seething frog</text>
  <text start="708.209" dur="4.781">last night and if you haven&amp;#39;t seen that</text>
  <text start="710.41" dur="4.59">video it&amp;#39;s a great one we did audio only</text>
  <text start="712.99" dur="3.75">because video was causing us some lag</text>
  <text start="715" dur="4.44">and we didn&amp;#39;t want to have the audio</text>
  <text start="716.74" dur="4.23">suffer but the interesting thing about</text>
  <text start="719.44" dur="2.64">the McCain CG well one of the many</text>
  <text start="720.97" dur="2.46">interesting things about the McCain</text>
  <text start="722.08" dur="4.14">situation we had Hillary like fallen</text>
  <text start="723.43" dur="3.99">asleep we had Michelle Obama like doing</text>
  <text start="726.22" dur="2.58">this motion with her head and then she</text>
  <text start="727.42" dur="3.93">caught the camera looking at her so she</text>
  <text start="728.8" dur="6.18">kind of Lance the way we had some like I</text>
  <text start="731.35" dur="5.22">think it was was it no it wasn&amp;#39;t Flynn</text>
  <text start="734.98" dur="3.9">we had some of the generals like</text>
  <text start="736.57" dur="3.87">basically catching like some of the bad</text>
  <text start="738.88" dur="3.12">guys like Huma was there and stuff they</text>
  <text start="740.44" dur="2.64">were just like staring her at one point</text>
  <text start="742" dur="2.88">you&amp;#39;ve got all these images floating</text>
  <text start="743.08" dur="3.33">around Twitter now where they&amp;#39;re drawing</text>
  <text start="744.88" dur="5.399">the line of their sight it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="746.41" dur="6.21">interesting and one interesting thing</text>
  <text start="750.279" dur="6.331">that came out was McCain&amp;#39;s casket was</text>
  <text start="752.62" dur="5.82">actually flown with Trump&amp;#39;s approval I</text>
  <text start="756.61" dur="5">mean they Trump was actually involved in</text>
  <text start="758.44" dur="4.98">giving them a plane to fly it to DC so</text>
  <text start="761.61" dur="3.13">fascinating right and then they still</text>
  <text start="763.42" dur="5.13">badmouth him and try to turn it into a</text>
  <text start="764.74" dur="5.849">Democrat political rally not working but</text>
  <text start="768.55" dur="3.84">it is ironic given the fact that it was</text>
  <text start="770.589" dur="6.211">a funeral and their party is dying</text>
  <text start="772.39" dur="5.88">so I guess there is that no he knows so</text>
  <text start="776.8" dur="4.05">let&amp;#39;s talk about a good news thing this</text>
  <text start="778.27" dur="4.559">is a great news thing all right Brad</text>
  <text start="780.85" dur="3.57">parce qu&amp;#39;elle Trump&amp;#39;s 2020 campaign</text>
  <text start="782.829" dur="3.241">manager who does not look like a</text>
  <text start="784.42" dur="3.6">campaign manager he looks like a badass</text>
  <text start="786.07" dur="5.07">military guy who&amp;#39;s like ready to kill</text>
  <text start="788.02" dur="5.309">people but that&amp;#39;s just my opinion he is</text>
  <text start="791.14" dur="5.01">actually kind of floating the idea what</text>
  <text start="793.329" dur="4.051">if Trump were to leave Twitter and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="796.15" dur="2.189">kind of implying that Twitter would be</text>
  <text start="797.38" dur="3.66">done they would</text>
  <text start="798.339" dur="3.99">would fall apart and I agree we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="801.04" dur="2.82">waiting on this for a long time maybe</text>
  <text start="802.329" dur="2.43">the timing was wrong but what if Trump</text>
  <text start="803.86" dur="3.419">were to go to gap</text>
  <text start="804.759" dur="5.7">what if Trump were to switch over to a</text>
  <text start="807.279" dur="5.73">halt you know truth or friendly or free</text>
  <text start="810.459" dur="4.92">speech friendly platforms what would</text>
  <text start="813.009" dur="5.041">they do Twitter and Facebook would fall</text>
  <text start="815.379" dur="4.44">apart overnight hey YouTube would stay</text>
  <text start="818.05" dur="3.99">around the Twitter and Facebook would be</text>
  <text start="819.819" dur="3.93">gone seriously I mean they might have</text>
  <text start="822.04" dur="4.44">like a remnant of a remnant left with</text>
  <text start="823.749" dur="3.96">just the insane left east but normal</text>
  <text start="826.48" dur="2.729">people would go over there I mean</text>
  <text start="827.709" dur="3.3">they&amp;#39;re better anyway and gab is a great</text>
  <text start="829.209" dur="3.63">program I don&amp;#39;t get to use it very often</text>
  <text start="831.009" dur="3.33">I don&amp;#39;t have a huge following there but</text>
  <text start="832.839" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s my background right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="834.339" dur="4.771">where I go when people ban me elsewhere</text>
  <text start="836.439" dur="4.62">so follow me on gab get an account on</text>
  <text start="839.11" dur="3.81">gap it&amp;#39;s time it really is and I think</text>
  <text start="841.059" dur="4.14">pretty soon Trump is probably gonna</text>
  <text start="842.92" dur="4.829">follow suit this is this is not an idle</text>
  <text start="845.199" dur="4.711">idle idea they don&amp;#39;t just put this stuff</text>
  <text start="847.749" dur="3.96">out there for no reason I think that</text>
  <text start="849.91" dur="4.349">this will happen probably before</text>
  <text start="851.709" dur="4.56">midterms it&amp;#39;s gonna shake everything up</text>
  <text start="854.259" dur="4.111">it&amp;#39;s gonna really piss off the MSM they</text>

  <text start="921.749" dur="3.671">judicial swamp and I will get to that in</text>
  <text start="924.1" dur="3.659">a moment</text>
  <text start="925.42" dur="4.289">Zero Hedge reported that Deripaska</text>
  <text start="927.759" dur="3.641">basically stated that he was recruited</text>
  <text start="929.709" dur="3.011">by Barack Obama&amp;#39;s government</text>
  <text start="931.4" dur="6.12">and we&amp;#39;re gonna get a little bit more</text>
  <text start="932.72" dur="6.51">into that as well let&amp;#39;s see in 2009 when</text>
  <text start="937.52" dur="3.78">Robert Mueller was running the FBI the</text>
  <text start="939.23" dur="3.39">agency asked their paska to spend twenty</text>
  <text start="941.3" dur="6.08">five million of his own money to</text>
  <text start="942.62" dur="7.83">bankroll an FBI supervised operation and</text>
  <text start="947.38" dur="5.5">yeah so this is back in I think 2009</text>
  <text start="950.45" dur="4.44">Mueller was the head of the FBI so</text>
  <text start="952.88" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;ve been working with this same guy</text>
  <text start="954.89" dur="5.7">for quite a while Deripaska was rumored</text>
  <text start="956.96" dur="6.18">to be Trump&amp;#39;s back channel to Putin you</text>
  <text start="960.59" dur="5.13">know via his Paul Manafort connections</text>
  <text start="963.14" dur="3.78">and it says he he actually saying he</text>
  <text start="965.72" dur="4.59">basically colluded with the US</text>
  <text start="966.92" dur="5.04">government between 2009 and 2016 so once</text>

  <text start="975.05" dur="4.47">Bruce or Deripaska everything is just</text>
  <text start="978.23" dur="2.82">falling apart and the only thing that</text>
  <text start="979.52" dur="3.12">they could do is basically take Manta</text>
