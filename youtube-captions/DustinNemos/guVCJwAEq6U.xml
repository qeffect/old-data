  <text start="37.53" dur="3.72">things that are kind of going around and</text>
  <text start="39.059" dur="3.84">put it into a much more macro sense of</text>
  <text start="41.25" dur="3.719">it I think of it almost like the</text>
  <text start="42.899" dur="3.721">butterfly effect where you know we kill</text>

  <text start="69.119" dur="5.761">things and try to extrapolate and sort</text>
  <text start="71.85" dur="5.19">of look ahead a little bit so you know</text>
  <text start="74.88" dur="3.69">this this is more about for from my</text>

  <text start="81.63" dur="4.29">up some other channels you know who can</text>

  <text start="96.21" dur="9.869">well if you like sure okay take it home</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="8.371">he&amp;#39;s all you owe you froze up again it</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="3.871">might be my end I&amp;#39;ve got someone have</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="4.62">the Q pose</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="6.029">start start that fourth part over again</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="5.28">for me I&amp;#39;m sorry I actually don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="115.979" dur="5.791">the Q pose actually in front of me so I</text>
  <text start="117.6" dur="7.08">okay well hey okay so 1862 is basically</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="6.87">the where I left off at 1861 where he</text>
  <text start="124.68" dur="5.579">was he said it&amp;#39;s that one where he had</text>
  <text start="128.64" dur="5.21">posted the picture of Epstein island&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="130.259" dur="5.841">dome okay this one seems to be all</text>
  <text start="133.85" dur="5.82">about like anti fun stuff I mean he</text>
  <text start="136.1" dur="8.18">starts off with the images of the you</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="6.84">know the the modern Anti Fog logo German</text>
  <text start="144.28" dur="6.1">Communist Party logo and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="146.51" dur="5.34">basically the same thing and and over</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="3.12">even over in Germany I think the</text>
  <text start="151.85" dur="3.27">anti-fog are getting pretty damn violent</text>
  <text start="153.5" dur="2.58">and riled up and there&amp;#39;ll I think</text>
  <text start="155.12" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re a lot bigger they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="156.08" dur="3.36">but he says fake news enemy of the</text>
  <text start="158.57" dur="2.79">people</text>
  <text start="159.44" dur="4.65">he says if all directions of the</text>
  <text start="161.36" dur="5.43">echo-chamber MSM state the same thing</text>
  <text start="164.09" dur="6.24">even if fiction or false do most people</text>
  <text start="166.79" dur="6.12">consider it true or factual he says</text>
  <text start="170.33" dur="4.38">direct communication is critical so</text>
  <text start="172.91" dur="5.91">obviously we have to go around the fake</text>
  <text start="174.71" dur="5.88">news as who controls the fake news why</text>
  <text start="178.82" dur="4.8">is auntie Fong allowed to incite</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="4.62">violence wear masks make threats using</text>
  <text start="183.62" dur="4.2">carry weapons and physically harm others</text>
  <text start="185.21" dur="4.74">who oppose their ideology I&amp;#39;ll even add</text>
  <text start="187.82" dur="3.63">like there&amp;#39;s even double standards in</text>
  <text start="189.95" dur="3.24">the court system like they get off you</text>
  <text start="191.45" dur="3.99">know they must have been ahead they get</text>
  <text start="193.19" dur="3.99">a couple years of probation so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="4.17">pretty rough there as well and then</text>
  <text start="197.18" dur="4.17">anybody on the right side or or whatever</text>
  <text start="199.61" dur="4.59">if they even defend themselves they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="201.35" dur="5.52">probably gonna go to prison so why does</text>
  <text start="204.2" dur="4.65">and Aoife tend to justify such violence</text>
  <text start="206.87" dur="5.88">by labeling the challenger as alright or</text>
  <text start="208.85" dur="6.15">nazi and why doesn&amp;#39;t the left condone</text>
  <text start="212.75" dur="5.58">such acts of violence and call for an</text>
  <text start="215" dur="5.58">immediate end so define projection</text>
  <text start="218.33" dur="5.13">defined insurance policy and define</text>
  <text start="220.58" dur="4.98">warning against attempts to unveil so I</text>
  <text start="223.46" dur="3.81">guess he&amp;#39;s basically calling out what it</text>
  <text start="225.56" dur="4.38">is I mean the leader just using antiphon</text>
  <text start="227.27" dur="8.73">as a sort of a bully in the room a</text>
  <text start="229.94" dur="8.85">threat he says go ahead and yeah I think</text>
  <text start="236" dur="5.22">when it comes to Antipa like a lot of</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="4.77">the time when it comes to like the like</text>
  <text start="241.22" dur="3.57">the liberal side of the argument of</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="3.63">stuff like that they have a habit of</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="5.46">projecting my friends into like hey</text>
  <text start="247.19" dur="5.04">you&amp;#39;re a Nazi no Antipa is actually</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="3.99">doing exactly what the Nazis did back</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="10.999">then which was beating up anyone who</text>
  <text start="254.24" dur="12.8">disagrees with their idea or calling him</text>
  <text start="263.229" dur="7.591">like no standards that they</text>
  <text start="267.04" dur="5.91">kind of go on top of but they even kind</text>
  <text start="270.82" dur="3.51">of have their own like clockwork around</text>
  <text start="272.95" dur="5.16">cement mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="5.04">yeah well I mean they do they they</text>
  <text start="278.11" dur="2.85">project everything and if you try to</text>
  <text start="279.37" dur="3.24">bring any historical context or anything</text>
  <text start="280.96" dur="3.74">you&amp;#39;re just immediately a Nazi therefore</text>
  <text start="282.61" dur="4.74">a target because you disagree with them</text>
  <text start="284.7" dur="4.51">and then I mean he calls it right there</text>
  <text start="287.35" dur="3.59">the next line is all in bold he says</text>
  <text start="289.21" dur="3.96">they prey on emotionally unstable</text>
  <text start="290.94" dur="4.75">helpless individuals and use them as</text>
  <text start="293.17" dur="4.65">pawns I mean that&amp;#39;s you know this</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="3.93">I see the whole system is sort of a low</text>
  <text start="297.82" dur="3.21">scale in a ultra at this point like</text>
  <text start="299.62" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;ve taken what they&amp;#39;ve learned and</text>
  <text start="301.03" dur="5.16">then they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re using that for the</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="8.73">mass manipulation of people and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="6.93">pretty one thing that I really kind of</text>
  <text start="311.56" dur="3.93">take from this is especially when I went</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="4.35">to school actually for an education</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="3.21">major and taking from what the campus</text>
  <text start="317.47" dur="4.89">looks like and all the different</text>
  <text start="318.7" dur="6.84">environments that come with it really at</text>
  <text start="322.36" dur="5.49">that age like 18 up to like early 20s</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re really trying to create that form</text>
  <text start="327.85" dur="3.3">of identity what you are you&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="329.8" dur="3.6">a person in high school anymore you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="4.2">now an adult and I think that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="333.4" dur="5.73">really happens now is that they kind of</text>
  <text start="335.35" dur="5.7">prey on these young fragile innocent</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="3.99">minds and they kind of fracture them</text>
  <text start="341.05" dur="2.94">into what they are I mean you have</text>
  <text start="343.12" dur="2.67">gender studies</text>
  <text start="343.99" dur="3.72">and then you talk about political</text>
  <text start="345.79" dur="3.42">science and you know all these different</text>
  <text start="347.71" dur="3.81">things and you know they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="5.01">hold on to just understanding what who</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="3.87">what and who they are and then you throw</text>
  <text start="354.22" dur="4.59">all these other things and they just</text>
  <text start="355.39" dur="5.52">kind of over over loads them yeah</text>
  <text start="358.81" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s something there&amp;#39;s something to</text>
  <text start="360.91" dur="4.11">this I think we&amp;#39;re you know young people</text>
  <text start="363.25" dur="4.35">are obviously more emotional more than</text>
  <text start="365.02" dur="3.87">reason and you know and that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="367.6" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s not necessarily a bad thing I mean</text>
  <text start="368.89" dur="4.68">young people have that passion and then</text>
  <text start="370.84" dur="4.2">in a lot of times they get into the they</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="2.55">want to be moral they want to they want</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="2.46">to change the world and they get that</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="2.94">like righteous indignation that</text>
  <text start="377.5" dur="3.12">righteous fury and at the same point</text>
  <text start="379.06" dur="4.71">there their heads are being stuffed full</text>
  <text start="380.62" dur="6.87">of all this fear and division talk and</text>
  <text start="383.77" dur="5.88">then and then that plays right into then</text>
  <text start="387.49" dur="4.5">kind of using that they feel like</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re the heroes in the story and and</text>
  <text start="391.99" dur="4.56">pushing that hate out there and then you</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="4.98">know that and fear mindset and that that</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="3.63">hate mindset it&amp;#39;s really hard to break</text>
  <text start="399.07" dur="1.8">through that because they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="2.4">emotional</text>
  <text start="400.87" dur="4.8">and they just kind of keep that going</text>
  <text start="402.58" dur="5.76">forever people sometimes check out of it</text>
  <text start="405.67" dur="5.13">but you know if they start trying to</text>
  <text start="408.34" dur="3.96">talk to you or something you know one of</text>
  <text start="410.8" dur="2.91">the one of the leaders of the anti-fog</text>
  <text start="412.3" dur="2.94">group will come over and start trying to</text>
  <text start="413.71" dur="3.54">like shoo them away don&amp;#39;t talk to this</text>
  <text start="415.24" dur="5.58">person or or something we&amp;#39;ve seen so</text>
  <text start="417.25" dur="5.04">many examples of that so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="420.82" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s definitely like a groupthink</text>
  <text start="422.29" dur="3.21">situation there&amp;#39;s a fear of being</text>
  <text start="423.97" dur="5.33">ostracized from the group a hammer that</text>
  <text start="425.5" dur="6.66">part in for sure but it&amp;#39;s just you know</text>
  <text start="429.3" dur="4.72">I&amp;#39;m kind of a farmer and this works with</text>
  <text start="432.16" dur="4.11">animals you can train them from birth if</text>

  <text start="1881.25" dur="4.76">beautiful to see like he&amp;#39;s just forcing</text>
  <text start="1883.59" dur="5.699">forcing it down their throats basically</text>
  <text start="1886.01" dur="4.899">when you had the unbridled US economy I</text>
  <text start="1889.289" dur="3.571">mean we could we could take some blows</text>
  <text start="1890.909" dur="4.051">that we needed to and we be able to</text>
  <text start="1892.86" dur="3.449">still be able to kick yeah it takes me</text>
  <text start="1894.96" dur="3.36">back to capitalism because back in the</text>
  <text start="1896.309" dur="4.62">early days of this country kind of when</text>
  <text start="1898.32" dur="5.099">we earned like I think it was 60% of the</text>
  <text start="1900.929" dur="4.201">world&amp;#39;s wealth in a few generations you</text>
  <text start="1903.419" dur="4.11">know back then you could walk you could</text>
  <text start="1905.13" dur="5.22">live a lifetime never meet a federal</text>
  <text start="1907.529" dur="5.851">government employee huh so small it was</text>
  <text start="1910.35" dur="4.41">so limited and that&amp;#39;s you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1913.38" dur="3.179">even want that because that grows into</text>
  <text start="1914.76" dur="4.95">this and 200 years it&amp;#39;s all it takes but</text>
  <text start="1916.559" dur="4.35">if I like to use that an example for</text>
  <text start="1919.71" dur="2.76">people because we didn&amp;#39;t have all these</text>
  <text start="1920.909" dur="2.911">taxes we still had the roads we still</text>
  <text start="1922.47" dur="3.75">had better schools that now we were</text>
  <text start="1923.82" dur="4.229">ahead of most people in education and if</text>
  <text start="1926.22" dur="3.089">we had we had our defense and everything</text>
  <text start="1928.049" dur="4.141">else nobody wanted to mess with us we</text>
  <text start="1929.309" dur="4.74">want all these Wars and at the same</text>
  <text start="1932.19" dur="3.66">point then we became so wealthy in such</text>
  <text start="1934.049" dur="3.63">a great middle class and we lifted all</text>
  <text start="1935.85" dur="3">of the poor up to the to this greatest</text>
  <text start="1937.679" dur="3.12">standard of living in the history of the</text>
  <text start="1938.85" dur="3.66">world if we had gone five percent</text>
  <text start="1940.799" dur="2.971">further if the founding fathers had just</text>
  <text start="1942.51" dur="3.899">you know bucked up and did the right</text>
  <text start="1943.77" dur="3.629">thing you know respect to them but if</text>
  <text start="1946.409" dur="2.851">they had just gotten rid of the</text>
  <text start="1947.399" dur="4.171">government completely and given freedom</text>
  <text start="1949.26" dur="3.36">back to people we would have built</text>
  <text start="1951.57" dur="1.65">something that would have never been</text>
  <text start="1952.62" dur="2.58">dislodged</text>
  <text start="1953.22" dur="3.449">and ever you know we would already be</text>
  <text start="1955.2" dur="3.15">exploring space while everyone else is</text>
  <text start="1956.669" dur="4.411">trying to you know deal with all of this</text>
  <text start="1958.35" dur="5.189">central bank crap and and in reality it</text>
  <text start="1961.08" dur="4.02">only takes one good example so people</text>
  <text start="1963.539" dur="3.781">would have would have eventually</text>
  <text start="1965.1" dur="4.11">rebelled and and and set their own</text>
  <text start="1967.32" dur="3.69">nations in the same kind of direction</text>
  <text start="1969.21" dur="4.189">and then we would have freed the whole</text>
  <text start="1971.01" dur="5.37">planet with that one move right there I</text>
  <text start="1973.399" dur="5.291">did to set up a state a limited</text>
  <text start="1976.38" dur="5.64">government and you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1978.69" dur="4.77">very intelligent arguments for it you</text>
  <text start="1982.02" dur="3.48">know and people don&amp;#39;t really understand</text>
  <text start="1983.46" dur="3.63">the arguments against and then when you</text>
  <text start="1985.5" dur="4.529">try to hear about that they get</text>
  <text start="1987.09" dur="4.35">suppressed you know like the hope you</text>
  <text start="1990.029" dur="2.701">know the anarchist party if you go look</text>
  <text start="1991.44" dur="5.13">up the history that is so sad what</text>
  <text start="1992.73" dur="6.059">happened there I remember that condition</text>
  <text start="1996.57" dur="3.959">because they talked about the the</text>
  <text start="1998.789" dur="5.451">executions of Sacco manzetti</text>
  <text start="2000.529" dur="5.421">mm-hmm and how they blamed</text>
  <text start="2004.24" dur="3.15">forgot what they actually blamed him on</text>
  <text start="2005.95" dur="4.95">I think was a Carson or something of</text>
  <text start="2007.39" dur="4.92">that nature and but when they actually</text>
  <text start="2010.9" dur="3.12">came to the trial of it they actually</text>
  <text start="2012.31" dur="3.03">literally just said look they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2014.02" dur="2.91">anarchists they want to take over they</text>
  <text start="2015.34" dur="3.57">want to destroy everything and then they</text>
  <text start="2016.93" dur="4.89">just kill them and what Mueller is doing</text>
  <text start="2018.91" dur="4.25">now exactly still ended back in the</text>
  <text start="2021.82" dur="6.72">court of public opinion</text>
  <text start="2023.16" dur="7.36">so it&amp;#39;s interesting because now we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="2028.54" dur="5.04">this interesting time where the the</text>
  <text start="2030.52" dur="5.28">elite are failing they are on the run</text>
  <text start="2033.58" dur="3.57">and they&amp;#39;re losing left and right but at</text>
  <text start="2035.8" dur="3.42">the same time we have like crypto</text>
  <text start="2037.15" dur="5.4">currencies and stuff which you know</text>
  <text start="2039.22" dur="4.71">logically speaking to me like I&amp;#39;ll use</text>
  <text start="2042.55" dur="2.49">Bitcoin as an example it&amp;#39;s not my</text>
  <text start="2043.93" dur="2.43">favorite I don&amp;#39;t even think it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2045.04" dur="3">be the one that wins I think it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2046.36" dur="6.17">than MySpace and then the Facebook is</text>
  <text start="2048.04" dur="7.2">coming along but as an example Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="2052.53" dur="4.09">decentralized like as long as they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2055.24" dur="3.42">take down every single computer on the</text>
  <text start="2056.62" dur="4.08">whole planet at once you cannot stop the</text>
  <text start="2058.66" dur="4.2">system there&amp;#39;s no one to arrest you</text>
  <text start="2060.7" dur="5.61">can&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s no head to cut off of the</text>
  <text start="2062.86" dur="4.83">snake so in theory once it becomes you</text>
  <text start="2066.31" dur="2.94">know it&amp;#39;s early stages it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2067.69" dur="3.12">convenient right now for people who</text>
  <text start="2069.25" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t understand technical stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2070.81" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s really like in the early stages but</text>
  <text start="2072.7" dur="4.56">when it becomes user friendly some of</text>
  <text start="2074.89" dur="4.89">the stuff like EOS Daniel Larimer things</text>
  <text start="2077.26" dur="5.49">like that they have this in user in mind</text>
  <text start="2079.78" dur="4.71">you know when this stuff becomes user</text>
  <text start="2082.75" dur="3.09">friendly just like an email system</text>
  <text start="2084.49" dur="2.61">people are going to learn it just like</text>
  <text start="2085.84" dur="4.02">the Internet people are gonna learn it</text>
  <text start="2087.1" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s going to change everything and the</text>
  <text start="2089.86" dur="3.09">natural consequence of that like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2091.57" dur="2.97">talking about down the road the</text>
  <text start="2092.95" dur="3.81">butterfly effect the natural consequence</text>
  <text start="2094.54" dur="4.26">of this inevitably I think eventually</text>
  <text start="2096.76" dur="4.32">depending on the rate of adoption is</text>
  <text start="2098.8" dur="4.44">that governments will no longer be able</text>
  <text start="2101.08" dur="4.05">to make fiat currencies work and I want</text>
  <text start="2103.24" dur="3.69">to want them and that means that they</text>
  <text start="2105.13" dur="3.93">will no longer be able to just print and</text>
  <text start="2106.93" dur="3.57">live off debt screw over the generations</text>
  <text start="2109.06" dur="3.39">build a lot of power and then use that</text>
  <text start="2110.5" dur="3.63">power to be corrupt over us so a</text>
  <text start="2112.45" dur="4.43">government that is forced to live within</text>
  <text start="2114.13" dur="5.55">its budget with a balanced budget is</text>
  <text start="2116.88" dur="5.14">infinitely preferable and in less</text>
  <text start="2119.68" dur="5.16">powerful and less able to be corrupt and</text>
  <text start="2122.02" dur="4.83">and tyrannical then something where they</text>
  <text start="2124.84" dur="3.54">can print you know billions of dollars</text>
  <text start="2126.85" dur="4.59">at a whim spend it and then screw</text>
  <text start="2128.38" dur="4.77">everyone else with inflation so you know</text>
  <text start="2131.44" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s like for the first time in human</text>
  <text start="2133.15" dur="4.86">history not only can capitalism actually</text>
  <text start="2136.18" dur="3.63">happened like I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s stopped</text>
  <text start="2138.01" dur="3.27">I think it&amp;#39;s inevitable at this point</text>
  <text start="2139.81" dur="3.3">like whether or not there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="2141.28" dur="3.36">philosophical argument to it now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2143.11" dur="4.23">the mathematical argument now it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2144.64" dur="5.52">matter of time especially with all the</text>
  <text start="2147.34" dur="4.26">technology we have with banking itself I</text>
  <text start="2150.16" dur="4.65">mean we have credit cards we have</text>

  <text start="2171.04" dur="4.05">same way they&amp;#39;re doing it well even cars</text>
  <text start="2173.38" dur="3.3">are putting blockchain technology into</text>

  <text start="2181.3" dur="3.81">using it they&amp;#39;re bringing in experts to</text>
  <text start="2182.83" dur="4.02">like make their stuff more efficient</text>
  <text start="2185.11" dur="4.14">using blockchain technology that&amp;#39;s step</text>
  <text start="2186.85" dur="4.92">one step two is going to be these these</text>
  <text start="2189.25" dur="3.87">uh these bridge technologies that bridge</text>
  <text start="2191.77" dur="3.09">the different types of popular</text>

  <text start="2227.44" dur="3.57">the quarter million reward but if it</text>
  <text start="2230.14" dur="4.05">stays unhackable</text>
  <text start="2231.01" dur="4.2">then people&amp;#39;s confidence are gonna go up</text>
  <text start="2234.19" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re not going to be like oh I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2235.21" dur="3.39">gonna get hacked you know so then that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2237.25" dur="2.52">gonna increase adoption all of the</text>

  <text start="2239.77" dur="4.65">but they didn&amp;#39;t have the technology</text>
  <text start="2241.6" dur="4.41">skills to stay safe they didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="2244.42" dur="3.81">go through all of the hassle like a</text>
  <text start="2246.01" dur="4.14">paper wallet or a cold storage laptop or</text>

  <text start="2278.38" dur="5.25">the beneficiaries I mean 1% adoption now</text>
  <text start="2281.349" dur="3.96">but five years down the road this</text>
  <text start="2283.63" dur="3.06">technology is growing so fast it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2285.309" dur="3.091">be like internet or cell phones it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2286.69" dur="4.589">just it&amp;#39;s gonna happen it&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>

  <text start="2295.72" dur="5.49">phone where no one can track and trace</text>
  <text start="2297.76" dur="5.039">you there&amp;#39;s the technology soon to get</text>
  <text start="2301.21" dur="3.72">rid of the internet and replace it with</text>
  <text start="2302.799" dur="3.78">a peer-to-peer like a torrent system of</text>
  <text start="2304.93" dur="2.939">Internet or you can be your own Internet</text>
  <text start="2306.579" dur="3.48">service provider and then sell it to</text>
  <text start="2307.869" dur="4.141">your neighbors and set up nodes and no</text>
  <text start="2310.059" dur="3.631">one you know there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s no like</text>

  <text start="2317.109" dur="5.341">set up your own internet provider</text>
  <text start="2318.16" dur="7.109">so this this stuff is gonna change</text>
  <text start="2322.45" dur="4.74">everything like by default by</text>
  <text start="2325.269" dur="5.52">mathematics by trustless systems no</text>
  <text start="2327.19" dur="4.829">there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s no real for me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2330.789" dur="3.151">an easy prediction I don&amp;#39;t usually like</text>
  <text start="2332.019" dur="4.111">to make predictions but to me it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2333.94" dur="3.3">a matter of when not if what do you</text>
  <text start="2336.13" dur="4.919">think I don&amp;#39;t know if you follow the</text>

  <text start="2431.98" dur="4.95">the one I haven&amp;#39;t messed with yet I know</text>
  <text start="2434.47" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a matter it&amp;#39;s a matter of</text>
  <text start="2436.93" dur="4.14">time and like bid shoot finally has like</text>
  <text start="2438.79" dur="3.75">an app that you can use for it cuz right</text>
  <text start="2441.07" dur="4.08">now all I can do is go on the internet</text>
  <text start="2442.54" dur="4.02">and you have to use on your browser but</text>
  <text start="2445.15" dur="3.99">I wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised that you know</text>
  <text start="2446.56" dur="4.26">when like YouTube finally hits rock</text>
  <text start="2449.14" dur="4.8">bottom which at this point looks like</text>
  <text start="2450.82" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s going to with all the contrivances</text>
  <text start="2453.94" dur="3.15">that comes with it you know they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2455.53" dur="3.99">probably have an effort like on your</text>
  <text start="2457.09" dur="4.26">phone or on like Roku or something like</text>
  <text start="2459.52" dur="4.26">that that way it&amp;#39;s much easier access</text>
  <text start="2461.35" dur="3.75">and then when that happens you know</text>
  <text start="2463.78" dur="3.75">people are just gonna jump to it because</text>

  <text start="2467.53" dur="5.7">of Service with it mmhmm yeah</text>
  <text start="2470.44" dur="4.35">absolutely I think I think if crypto is</text>
  <text start="2473.23" dur="4.41">like the and the Internet as well as</text>
  <text start="2474.79" dur="4.35">like the ultimate butterfly effect it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2477.64" dur="4.68">gonna it&amp;#39;s gonna rock the whole world</text>
  <text start="2479.14" dur="4.92">and and everything what was the joke</text>
  <text start="2482.32" dur="4.56">with it it was the DARPA project that</text>
  <text start="2484.06" dur="5.28">got away maybe some people say that it</text>
  <text start="2486.88" dur="5.55">was a like a deep state project to try</text>
  <text start="2489.34" dur="4.35">to take over the money system but if</text>
  <text start="2492.43" dur="2.49">that&amp;#39;s the case it&amp;#39;s kind of like</text>
  <text start="2493.69" dur="3.24">queueing on they&amp;#39;re really shooting</text>
  <text start="2494.92" dur="4.44">themselves in the foot some people say</text>
  <text start="2496.93" dur="4.08">the same thing about Q like that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2499.36" dur="4.11">case then they&amp;#39;re doing everything wrong</text>
  <text start="2501.01" dur="4.47">like you know you don&amp;#39;t want to have a</text>
  <text start="2503.47" dur="4.56">decentralized system that&amp;#39;s trustless a</text>
  <text start="2505.48" dur="4.47">peer-to-peer it&amp;#39;s open source and people</text>
  <text start="2508.03" dur="4.95">can confirm and read you know if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2509.95" dur="4.32">got a system where you need to keep it</text>
  <text start="2512.98" dur="2.94">centralized and you need to be able to</text>
  <text start="2514.27" dur="3.51">print money at will and you need to be</text>
  <text start="2515.92" dur="3.33">able to track and trace people you can</text>
  <text start="2517.78" dur="3.6">track and trace people with Bitcoin I</text>
  <text start="2519.25" dur="4.68">mean there&amp;#39;s a flaws like like if I send</text>
  <text start="2521.38" dur="4.5">you money on Bitcoin then I can see your</text>
  <text start="2523.93" dur="3.03">public address and I can&amp;#39;t hack you or</text>
  <text start="2525.88" dur="2.46">anything it&amp;#39;s just like an email address</text>
  <text start="2526.96" dur="2.58">but I can go and then look at the</text>
  <text start="2528.34" dur="3.48">blockchain and see how much money you</text>
  <text start="2529.54" dur="4.5">have you know though there are there are</text>
  <text start="2531.82" dur="3.84">problems with that you can you can get</text>
  <text start="2534.04" dur="3.45">around that with like having multiple</text>
  <text start="2535.66" dur="3.33">wallets and you just have one is your</text>
  <text start="2537.49" dur="3.99">you know the one that you send</text>
  <text start="2538.99" dur="5.04">and stuff but some of the other</text>
  <text start="2541.48" dur="5.73">currencies like Manero like the privacy</text>
  <text start="2544.03" dur="5.49">coins these are going to destroy things</text>
  <text start="2547.21" dur="4.44">like the IRS things like the ability to</text>
  <text start="2549.52" dur="5.49">collect taxes I mean all taxes will be</text>
  <text start="2551.65" dur="6.3">then voluntary item an arrow is actually</text>
  <text start="2555.01" dur="6.03">uh you can actually mine monaro off a</text>
  <text start="2557.95" dur="5.22">bit patoot yeah actually uh actually</text>
  <text start="2561.04" dur="5.37">have an application that actually goes</text>
  <text start="2563.17" dur="5.1">to an external address and actually you</text>
  <text start="2566.41" dur="5.28">start you can actually start mining in</text>
  <text start="2568.27" dur="5.91">yourselves mm-hmm and you know you can</text>
  <text start="2571.69" dur="5.82">modify how many threads you will mines</text>
  <text start="2574.18" dur="5.01">and the speed it does that I know I know</text>
  <text start="2577.51" dur="3.33">I got into it for awhile and I was</text>
  <text start="2579.19" dur="3.69">trying to actually do some mining myself</text>
  <text start="2580.84" dur="4.62">but the tattin the technical part of it</text>
  <text start="2582.88" dur="5.01">got that kinda got me you know I</text>
  <text start="2585.46" dur="5.19">actually I did buy a small like a minor</text>
  <text start="2587.89" dur="5.19">for an altcoin called deke red and I</text>
  <text start="2590.65" dur="5.46">sell it for bitcoins so basically I have</text>
  <text start="2593.08" dur="5.64">like a little bit of Bitcoin everyday</text>
  <text start="2596.11" dur="7.47">it&amp;#39;s like a dollar or something but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2598.72" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s interesting I don&amp;#39;t really you know</text>
  <text start="2603.58" dur="4.08">I don&amp;#39;t want to dump a lot of money into</text>
  <text start="2605.65" dur="3.93">it yet because that helps that whole</text>
  <text start="2607.66" dur="3.75">thing is changing so fast right now and</text>
  <text start="2609.58" dur="3.9">the technology just keeps changing and</text>
  <text start="2611.41" dur="3.75">then the hash strength gets stronger and</text>
  <text start="2613.48" dur="6.12">stronger but we&amp;#39;re getting into crypto</text>
  <text start="2615.16" dur="5.64">and my people hate ripped off just in</text>
  <text start="2619.6" dur="2.55">general I mean look at all the different</text>
  <text start="2620.8" dur="3.809">technologies how they&amp;#39;re like oh they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2622.15" dur="4.05">going to use it against us you know like</text>
  <text start="2624.609" dur="3.691">they&amp;#39;re going to track our emails and so</text>
  <text start="2626.2" dur="3">on and so forth and notice how recently</text>
  <text start="2628.3" dur="3.45">especially during like the Great</text>
  <text start="2629.2" dur="4.409">Awakening era like the few times we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2631.75" dur="2.88">been able to basically play judo with it</text>
  <text start="2633.609" dur="2.551">we&amp;#39;re gonna be we&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="2634.63" dur="2.91">basically use it right back at you you</text>
  <text start="2636.16" dur="2.76">know I was just thinking that yeah like</text>
  <text start="2637.54" dur="4.53">the internet that wasn&amp;#39;t created for</text>
  <text start="2638.92" dur="4.74">basically military project and they try</text>
  <text start="2642.07" dur="3.39">to use it to track and trace and control</text>
  <text start="2643.66" dur="3.24">everything and they did but now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2645.46" dur="6.21">using it to overthrow the whole system</text>
  <text start="2646.9" dur="11.4">like we catch up I mean you know how</text>
  <text start="2651.67" dur="9.78">they&amp;#39;re doing with Twitter I mean people</text>
  <text start="2658.3" dur="8.28">one Twitter well all the memes are going</text>
  <text start="2661.45" dur="6.48">you know and like the I mean this could</text>
  <text start="2666.58" dur="2.46">be actually the resurgence of an</text>
  <text start="2667.93" dur="4.26">independent industry</text>
