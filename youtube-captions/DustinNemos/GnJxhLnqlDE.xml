  <text start="5.49" dur="4.02">of very interesting and exciting and</text>
  <text start="7.35" dur="3.39">some troubling news today and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="9.51" dur="2.549">going to go through that but first let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="10.74" dur="3.18">go through a couple of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="12.059" dur="4.581">accomplishments and this for those</text>
  <text start="13.92" dur="5.55">who&amp;#39;ve been asking is promises kept calm</text>
  <text start="16.64" dur="4.299">alright so wage growth soared to at its</text>
  <text start="19.47" dur="3.75">fastest pace since the Great Recession</text>
  <text start="20.939" dur="4.111">and the unemployment rate held near a</text>
  <text start="23.22" dur="4.02">generational low of three point nine</text>
  <text start="25.05" dur="3.809">percent unemployment remains</text>
  <text start="27.24" dur="3.66">historically low as the number of</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="4.551">Americans filing for unemployment hit</text>
  <text start="30.9" dur="6.27">its lowest point since 1969</text>
  <text start="33.41" dur="5.62">so very good accomplishments from Trump</text>
  <text start="37.17" dur="4.909">and the jobs department as he&amp;#39;s known</text>
  <text start="39.03" dur="7.11">for the new AG Whittaker has already</text>
  <text start="42.079" dur="6.82">came out strong he&amp;#39;s backing Trump up</text>
  <text start="46.14" dur="5.399">when it comes to the caravan especially</text>
  <text start="48.899" dur="4.771">but just immigration in general he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="4.081">basically saying look the law is</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="3.81">well-established the president can turn</text>
  <text start="55.62" dur="4.079">off asylum if he wants to if we&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="57.48" dur="3.469">overwhelmed or if it&amp;#39;s you know kind of</text>
  <text start="59.699" dur="4.11">with the situation we&amp;#39;re in right now</text>
  <text start="60.949" dur="4.78">and I imagine the Trump will then do</text>
  <text start="63.809" dur="3.691">this because these people don&amp;#39;t deserve</text>
  <text start="65.729" dur="4.831">asylum obviously they&amp;#39;ve already turned</text>
  <text start="67.5" dur="4.35">Asylum down in Mexico so they don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="71.85" dur="4.29">many of them are overweight it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="5.73">like they&amp;#39;re starving and most of them</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="4.89">are military aged man not to mention the</text>

  <text start="81.03" dur="3.36">that human traffickers embedded in there</text>
  <text start="82.77" dur="4.68">and we&amp;#39;ve already seen kids go missing</text>
  <text start="84.39" dur="4.619">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a bunch of craziness so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="87.45" dur="3.27">good to see him come out swinging he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.009" dur="4.201">there&amp;#39;s social media pictures of him all</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="3.93">over of him like binging heavy weights</text>
  <text start="93.21" dur="2.729">and things like that and doing</text>
  <text start="94.65" dur="3.84">weightlifting and that kind of stuff so</text>
  <text start="95.939" dur="4.771">hopefully he lives up to his already I</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="5.58">guess badass reputation he was kind of</text>
  <text start="100.71" dur="6.119">an overnight stealth bomber you know to</text>
  <text start="104.07" dur="4.74">kind of hit back to cue a little bit of</text>
  <text start="106.829" dur="4.921">course the trunk that the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="108.81" dur="4.949">going you know pretty hard on the</text>

  <text start="113.759" dur="3.331">trying to get back to the Russia thing</text>
  <text start="115.53" dur="3.449">and that there&amp;#39;s nothing there for them</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="6.3">to really use but they&amp;#39;re gonna try</text>
  <text start="118.979" dur="6.871">nonetheless of course and oh by the way</text>
  <text start="123.39" dur="5.31">the big news really of the day is that</text>
  <text start="125.85" dur="4.95">Ruth Bader Ginsburg you know obviously</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="3.509">she fell and supposedly cracked some</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="2.97">ribs maybe that&amp;#39;s just a way to get out</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="3.571">of the job because she&amp;#39;s tired of it</text>
  <text start="133.77" dur="5.76">I even hear her cancer is returning but</text>
  <text start="135.78" dur="6.21">she is done January 2019 she is she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="139.53" dur="5.49">gone so we&amp;#39;re gonna get another Supreme</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="4.53">Court see no wonder they were so worried</text>
  <text start="145.02" dur="3.27">about Kavanagh of course because that</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="4.56">gave us the majority that we needed for</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="6.21">true justice but this this is gonna kind</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="4.77">of give us a little extra power in the</text>
  <text start="154.5" dur="3.03">Supreme Court and that&amp;#39;s great you know</text>
  <text start="155.85" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;ll have a little bit better margins</text>
  <text start="157.53" dur="7.74">of success that way we&amp;#39;ve also had nine</text>
  <text start="161.52" dur="5.79">people arrested by the Texas AG for</text>
  <text start="165.27" dur="5.25">voter fraud and this was kind of an</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="6.27">organized voter fraud scheme and I need</text>
  <text start="170.52" dur="4.71">to mention by the way this was going on</text>
  <text start="173.58" dur="3.54">we&amp;#39;re gonna cover some of it not all of</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="3.63">it was some of it this is going on</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="3.39">across the states there are many</text>
  <text start="178.86" dur="6.59">situations of voter fraud being exposed</text>
  <text start="180.51" dur="4.94">and challenged very interesting stuff</text>
  <text start="186.14" dur="4.24">speaking of which authorities</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="4.38">investigating possible election fraud in</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="5.49">Florida he&amp;#39;s even said and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="4.86">if it was in this article and of course</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="5.52">Broward County and we&amp;#39;ll get into that</text>
  <text start="197.46" dur="5.37">too and Scott&amp;#39;s coming out too saying he</text>
  <text start="201.39" dur="3.15">will not sit idly by while unethical</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="7.05">liberals try to steal this election from</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="6.78">the great people of Florida and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="3.84">know where the quote is from Trump but</text>
  <text start="211.32" dur="5.1">he basically said he was gonna have his</text>
  <text start="213.72" dur="5.67">lawyers go down to Florida to expose the</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="6.45">fraud that&amp;#39;s pretty close to a direct</text>
  <text start="219.39" dur="5.43">quote - so very interesting we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="222.87" dur="4.32">see a big battleground in Florida once</text>
  <text start="224.82" dur="3.96">again when it comes to are we gonna</text>
  <text start="227.19" dur="3.15">allow this kind of election fraud to go</text>
  <text start="228.78" dur="3.27">on they&amp;#39;re still putting out votes in</text>
  <text start="230.34" dur="2.97">Broward County they&amp;#39;re still you know</text>
  <text start="232.05" dur="2.55">and that there&amp;#39;s no reason for that</text>
  <text start="233.31" dur="3.18">there are other counties just as big</text>
  <text start="234.6" dur="6.78">that got it turned in on time this is</text>
  <text start="236.49" dur="6.12">this is obviously a scandal and the</text>
  <text start="241.38" dur="2.85">woman that&amp;#39;s in charge down there has</text>
  <text start="242.61" dur="5.46">got a long history of things like this</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="5.28">so and in a smug arrogance like someone</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="3.3">who&amp;#39;s just never been punished for</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="3.03">anything corrupt before she&amp;#39;s gotten so</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="4.17">used to getting away with it you know</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="4.65">she she is just not sure what&amp;#39;s about to</text>
  <text start="255.54" dur="6.18">hit her she&amp;#39;s already exposed and she</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="5.789">doesn&amp;#39;t know it okay so kind of on the</text>
  <text start="261.72" dur="3.72">health topic of things</text>
  <text start="262.979" dur="4.591">you guys remember finally someone</text>
  <text start="265.44" dur="3.84">successfully sued Monsanto which was</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="4.38">bought out by Bayer so someone&amp;#39;s finally</text>
  <text start="269.28" dur="5.94">successfully sued Bayer for 300 million</text>
  <text start="271.95" dur="5.73">for getting cancer from glyphosate or</text>
  <text start="275.22" dur="5.1">some something you like phosphate the</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="6.69">the Roundup Ready product that&amp;#39;s in all</text>
  <text start="280.32" dur="4.68">the stores and now wouldn&amp;#39;t you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="2.94">you know it</text>
  <text start="285" dur="3.9">they are calling people who are suing</text>
  <text start="287.31" dur="3.66">them that these cancer victims they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="288.9" dur="4.5">calling them nuisances and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.97" dur="4.89">trying to keep it on the market and that</text>
  <text start="293.4" dur="4.68">just goes to show you know those little</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="3.93">people they&amp;#39;re just the nuisances you</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="3.06">know who cares if they die right because</text>
  <text start="299.79" dur="3.2">they&amp;#39;re useless eaters that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.14" dur="4.59">kind of the prevailing elite perspective</text>
  <text start="302.99" dur="4.81">and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a pessimistic</text>
  <text start="305.73" dur="6.18">perspective because yes many people are</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="7.2">a bit useless when it comes to you know</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="6.3">maybe even in terms of helping others</text>
  <text start="315" dur="5.7">but at least in terms of contributing to</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="5.07">mankind as a whole but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="320.7" dur="4.53">they deserve to be killed because you</text>
  <text start="323.28" dur="3.51">never know genetically speaking when</text>
  <text start="325.23" dur="5.04">you&amp;#39;re gonna get a wild card and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="5.1">going to be the next Tesla and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="3">lot you can do to help that and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="331.89" dur="4.5">a lot you could do to hurt that in terms</text>
  <text start="333.27" dur="6.81">of eating the right things but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.39" dur="5.1">just the eugenics trap you know many of</text>
  <text start="340.08" dur="2.4">us think that certain people shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="3.72">be allowed to have kids because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="342.48" dur="4.92">so darn stupid and terrible but at the</text>
  <text start="345.21" dur="3.66">end of the day when power like that is</text>
  <text start="347.4" dur="3.51">created it will be abused and then you</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="5.52">get into like a race war and eugenics</text>
  <text start="350.91" dur="5.04">and that kind of thing so you know</text>
  <text start="354.39" dur="3.99">anyone who thinks that they have that</text>
  <text start="355.95" dur="3.78">sort of arrogant position that they know</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="5.4">what&amp;#39;s best for the world and who gets</text>
  <text start="359.73" dur="5.61">to live and die I I think wisdom would</text>
  <text start="363.78" dur="3.8">speak against that I think we should</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="5.91">just let nature take its course there</text>
  <text start="367.58" dur="4.96">big fan of natural selection but remove</text>
  <text start="371.25" dur="2.85">some of those warning labels out there</text>
  <text start="372.54" dur="3.63">and see what happens but not killing</text>
  <text start="374.1" dur="3.99">people off and letting them dive by</text>
  <text start="376.17" dur="5.04">intentionally poisoning people that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="7.5">terrible anyway moving on I&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="381.21" dur="6.96">long issue with with Monsanto they even</text>
  <text start="385.59" dur="4.17">they even called the FBI to my house one</text>
  <text start="388.17" dur="4.14">time because I posted a non-violent</text>
  <text start="389.76" dur="5.46">message on the millions against Monsanto</text>
  <text start="392.31" dur="4.35">Facebook page not even joking so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="395.22" dur="3.18">been here in the background a long time</text>
  <text start="396.66" dur="3">fighting I think I was like 19 or</text>
  <text start="398.4" dur="2.51">something at the time it was pretty</text>
  <text start="399.66" dur="2.27">crazy experience I</text>
  <text start="400.91" dur="3.23">that they&amp;#39;re gonna lecture them for an</text>
  <text start="401.93" dur="4.11">hour about the evils they were defending</text>
  <text start="404.14" dur="3.37">but at the end of the day it was just</text>
  <text start="406.04" dur="3.36">trying to intimidate people out of their</text>
  <text start="407.51" dur="3.78">free speech and Monsanto has been there</text>
  <text start="409.4" dur="3.9">all along one of the most evil and maybe</text>
  <text start="411.29" dur="4.5">even is the most evil corporation on the</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="4.68">planet their goal basically almost a</text>
  <text start="415.79" dur="5.67">stated goal is to own the the food</text>
  <text start="417.98" dur="8.37">supply through all these GMO genetically</text>
  <text start="421.46" dur="8.22">engineered toxic foods that they can</text>
  <text start="426.35" dur="5.52">then patent and control and MA and</text>
  <text start="429.68" dur="5.61">monopolize so that&amp;#39;s kind of their thing</text>
  <text start="431.87" dur="5.19">and that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;ve been on the</text>
  <text start="435.29" dur="3.66">debate issue with you know I&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="437.06" dur="4.23">about how it used to debate you know</text>
  <text start="438.95" dur="4.5">vaccines and politics and stuff on</text>
  <text start="441.29" dur="4.23">social media and that&amp;#39;s kind of where I</text>
  <text start="443.45" dur="4.38">learned what I know of philosophy as</text>
  <text start="445.52" dur="6.09">well but that one was one of the big</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="6.36">ones too was the GMO stuff okay so Bill</text>

  <text start="487.73" dur="3.39">having some strong security around these</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="3.75">things because they&amp;#39;re the people&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="491.12" dur="4.62">when it comes to the democratic process</text>

  <text start="1165.07" dur="4.23">some crazy person just decides to go</text>

  <text start="1173.2" dur="4.65">belief at what point is it too much of a</text>
  <text start="1175.72" dur="4.31">coincidence to be believable anymore and</text>
  <text start="1177.85" dur="4.62">will people begin to see the pattern</text>
  <text start="1180.03" dur="6.16">because it is a pattern and it is quite</text>
  <text start="1182.47" dur="4.92">apparent all right and this was this is</text>
  <text start="1186.19" dur="3.12">very interesting from just a</text>
  <text start="1187.39" dur="4.38">technological standpoint I saw some of</text>
  <text start="1189.31" dur="4.23">these numbers and I my jaw dropped I was</text>
  <text start="1191.77" dur="3.51">really like I had to read it back to</text>
  <text start="1193.54" dur="4.47">myself out loud to be honest because it</text>
  <text start="1195.28" dur="5.4">was incredible so Russia&amp;#39;s deploying</text>
  <text start="1198.01" dur="4.41">something called a vanguard hypersonic</text>
  <text start="1200.68" dur="3.54">glide vehicle I&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="1202.42" dur="3.21">about their new glide technology for a</text>

  <text start="1205.63" dur="5.76">well people you know I didn&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="1207.94" dur="6.15">was nearly ready at all however let me</text>
  <text start="1211.39" dur="5.55">show you some of the numbers on here it</text>
  <text start="1214.09" dur="6.06">can fly at speeds of over to Mach 20</text>
  <text start="1216.94" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s 15,000 300 miles per hour or four</text>
  <text start="1220.15" dur="5.25">miles per second I don&amp;#39;t even know if</text>
  <text start="1223" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;d see that and that could reach</text>
  <text start="1225.4" dur="6.57">washington from russia in about 15</text>
  <text start="1227.71" dur="7.23">minutes probably faster at that speed</text>
  <text start="1231.97" dur="5.34">there&amp;#39;s no way to intercept it as it</text>
  <text start="1234.94" dur="5.78">moves in a cloud of plasma like a meteor</text>
  <text start="1237.31" dur="8.18">right is what they&amp;#39;re saying here so</text>
  <text start="1240.72" dur="8.29">these things are the new type of</text>
  <text start="1245.49" dur="5.29">advanced missile and nowhere is safe no</text>
  <text start="1249.01" dur="4.05">one can stop it</text>
  <text start="1250.78" dur="5.22">our weapons once again are outgrowing</text>
  <text start="1253.06" dur="4.25">our wisdom and it is an interesting new</text>
  <text start="1256" dur="4.62">future that we&amp;#39;re going into of course</text>
  <text start="1257.31" dur="4.42">the only the only protection that you</text>
  <text start="1260.62" dur="2.52">can have is mutually assured destruction</text>
  <text start="1261.73" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s all that&amp;#39;s left at this point</text>
  <text start="1263.14" dur="3.39">ever since nukes at least mutual assured</text>
  <text start="1265.3" dur="3.21">destruction doesn&amp;#39;t matter how big the</text>
  <text start="1266.53" dur="4.53">weapons get we&amp;#39;ll all die if we use them</text>
  <text start="1268.51" dur="4.89">so it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1271.06" dur="4.32">an unfortunate place to be in but it is</text>
  <text start="1273.4" dur="3.33">better than one side having this kind of</text>
  <text start="1275.38" dur="3.87">technology and the rest of us using</text>
  <text start="1276.73" dur="4.98">muskets ok that&amp;#39;s what that&amp;#39;s why we</text>
  <text start="1279.25" dur="3.93">have to the exact same reason that we</text>
  <text start="1281.71" dur="3.36">have to be aware of what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="1283.18" dur="3.54">the world and we have to stay in aware</text>
  <text start="1285.07" dur="3.15">of all of these are cold hidden things</text>
  <text start="1286.72" dur="3.14">that they&amp;#39;re trying to sneak behind us</text>
  <text start="1288.22" dur="5.82">with their symbols and things like that</text>
  <text start="1289.86" dur="7.36">and it&amp;#39;s the same thing as a weapon war</text>
  <text start="1294.04" dur="4.59">a physical war a hot war between someone</text>
  <text start="1297.22" dur="3.12">with these kind of missiles and this</text>
  <text start="1298.63" dur="6.09">kind of technology and someone with bows</text>
  <text start="1300.34" dur="7.44">and arrows or rocks it&amp;#39;s just on an</text>
  <text start="1304.72" dur="4.98">intellectual and social and cultural and</text>
  <text start="1307.78" dur="3.84">economic front instead of an actual</text>
  <text start="1309.7" dur="3.33">physical front these are all it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1311.62" dur="4.05">multi spectrum war that we&amp;#39;re involved</text>
  <text start="1313.03" dur="4.23">in in fact the physical is probably the</text>
  <text start="1315.67" dur="4.44">least important because it&amp;#39;s the least</text>
  <text start="1317.26" dur="4.41">needed at least used of all I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="1320.11" dur="3.39">that they definitely have that in their</text>
  <text start="1321.67" dur="4.95">arsenal they have private armies at this</text>
  <text start="1323.5" dur="5.01">point but they don&amp;#39;t need them you know</text>
  <text start="1326.62" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;ve got TV mind control on everybody</text>
  <text start="1328.51" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;ve got Netflix distracting everyone</text>
  <text start="1330.46" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;ve got everyone addicted to drugs</text>
  <text start="1332.71" dur="2.76">and fast food and junk food and so</text>
  <text start="1334.3" dur="3.78">overwork they don&amp;#39;t have time to think</text>
  <text start="1335.47" dur="4.41">about anything else so they don&amp;#39;t who</text>
  <text start="1338.08" dur="4.77">needs soldiers you know you&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="1339.88" dur="5.01">slaves keeping themselves enslaved but</text>
  <text start="1342.85" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s it for today I won&amp;#39;t check and</text>
  <text start="1344.89" dur="2.52">see if there&amp;#39;s any new cue I should</text>
  <text start="1346.27" dur="4.89">cover real fast</text>
  <text start="1347.41" dur="4.89">I usually separate them out but right</text>
  <text start="1351.16" dur="3.12">now I&amp;#39;m just putting them together</text>
  <text start="1352.3" dur="4.29">because all of this all of these things</text>
  <text start="1354.28" dur="3.66">are part and parcel of the same thing</text>
  <text start="1356.59" dur="3.27">and of course right here with midterms</text>
  <text start="1357.94" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s a lot of queue stuff going into</text>
  <text start="1359.86" dur="3.63">that as well whether you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1361.63" dur="3.3">following it or not many people are</text>
  <text start="1363.49" dur="3.66">millions of people are and it needs to</text>
  <text start="1364.93" dur="5.58">be talked about because even if you</text>
  <text start="1367.15" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t believe it of course it matters</text>
  <text start="1370.51" dur="2.52">other people will believe it therefore</text>
  <text start="1371.8" dur="2.73">they will act on it therefore you need</text>
  <text start="1373.03" dur="3.06">to know about it because if you want to</text>
  <text start="1374.53" dur="3.39">actually predict and pay attention to</text>
  <text start="1376.09" dur="4.58">what&amp;#39;s going on you also need to know</text>
  <text start="1377.92" dur="5.97">what other people are doing nothing new</text>
  <text start="1380.67" dur="6.64">still the same post 2460 about martial</text>
