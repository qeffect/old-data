  <text start="68.12" dur="6.72">video in fact it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s frightening in</text>
  <text start="71.479" dur="5.211">the u.s. we have Republican senators on</text>
  <text start="74.84" dur="5.4">the run from the police</text>
  <text start="76.69" dur="6.609">because Democrat governors are trying to</text>
  <text start="80.24" dur="6.48">have them hunted down for not doing what</text>
  <text start="83.299" dur="5.43">they want in legislative bodies so this</text>
  <text start="86.72" dur="5.28">is kind of an a general gist of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.729" dur="5.971">happening now here&amp;#39;s kind of the the</text>
  <text start="92" dur="4.68">brief version of this particular</text>
  <text start="94.7" dur="3.66">incident okay because we&amp;#39;ve kind of hit</text>
  <text start="96.68" dur="4.02">a new threshold here that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="98.36" dur="4.47">crazy now I know you know Lincoln</text>
  <text start="100.7" dur="3.33">arrested a bunch of you know southern</text>
  <text start="102.83" dur="3.36">lawmakers that kind of stuff it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="104.03" dur="3.3">happened in the past you know we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="106.19" dur="2.46">comments like you know</text>
  <text start="107.33" dur="3.54">good luck enforcing it from the</text>
  <text start="108.65" dur="4.38">president too you know</text>
  <text start="110.87" dur="3.72">lawmakers in the past but in in the</text>
  <text start="113.03" dur="3.15">modern sense this is quite frightening</text>
  <text start="114.59" dur="3.66">especially in this heated political</text>
  <text start="116.18" dur="5.82">climate now what do I mean</text>
  <text start="118.25" dur="6.03">so in Oregon there is a Democrat</text>
  <text start="122" dur="5.94">supermajority and a Democrat governor</text>
  <text start="124.28" dur="6.87">and a minority Republican senator our</text>
  <text start="127.94" dur="4.65">Senate base however to pass anything you</text>
  <text start="131.15" dur="4.229">gotta at least have two Republicans</text>
  <text start="132.59" dur="5.24">present so Republicans actually left</text>
  <text start="135.379" dur="5.311">this the building and refused to vote</text>
  <text start="137.83" dur="4.36">stalling a vote on cap and trade of</text>
  <text start="140.69" dur="4.71">course which carbon credit you know</text>
  <text start="142.19" dur="4.86">global warming nonsense it doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="145.4" dur="4.309">any sense doesn&amp;#39;t help anyway it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="5.969">another taxes scheme and it kills jobs</text>
  <text start="149.709" dur="6.011">anyway so Republicans position is that</text>
  <text start="153.019" dur="5.041">this should be sent to a ballot citizens</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="4.529">should have a say and this shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="158.06" dur="3.49">a top-down authoritarian decision from a</text>
  <text start="160.249" dur="3.971">supermajority criminal</text>
  <text start="161.55" dur="4.68">everyone the Democrats position is I</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="6.03">will have you rounded up by the police</text>
  <text start="166.23" dur="5.46">and brought back in for quorum so you</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="2.88">know my words not theirs but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="171.69" dur="3.81">exactly what governor Kate brown</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="4.92">authorized the State Police to do track</text>
  <text start="175.5" dur="4.68">down Republican lawmakers who have</text>
  <text start="178.05" dur="5.13">stalled a vote on the carbon credit</text>
  <text start="180.18" dur="6.18">legislation by walking out and refusing</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="5.27">to vote now the response is and this is</text>
  <text start="186.36" dur="7.5">a this is a I think all eleven of them</text>
  <text start="188.45" dur="8.5">this was a unanimous decision by all of</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="21.78">them and here is what is being said</text>
  <text start="196.95" dur="20.91">about this now listen to this Wow so</text>
  <text start="215.64" dur="4.65">send bachelors men without wives and</text>
  <text start="217.86" dur="5.91">children because they might get killed</text>
  <text start="220.29" dur="5.61">in self-defense and come heavily armed</text>
  <text start="223.77" dur="4.56">because you&amp;#39;re gonna need it to take</text>
  <text start="225.9" dur="5.55">this guy into cuffs because this is</text>
  <text start="228.33" dur="4.62">wrong that&amp;#39;s his position it seems to be</text>
  <text start="231.45" dur="6.81">the message that I&amp;#39;m getting out of it</text>
  <text start="232.95" dur="8.7">at least so that&amp;#39;s was days ago now we</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="5.67">have just two days ago breaking Oregon&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.65" dur="5.01">Senate session canceled for Saturday</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="5.07">after reports of a rally planned at the</text>
  <text start="246.66" dur="4.95">Capitol that could have included militia</text>
  <text start="249" dur="4.92">group members now this is after the</text>
  <text start="251.61" dur="4.95">three percenters a militia group I guess</text>
  <text start="253.92" dur="6.12">that they&amp;#39;re offered protection to the</text>
  <text start="256.56" dur="5.58">Oregon State Senate Republicans which</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="3.33">they refused the whatever they declined</text>
  <text start="262.14" dur="4.35">it they don&amp;#39;t want to in this it</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="4.74">actually end up in bloodshed you know</text>
  <text start="266.49" dur="4.14">what would it be if we had a Republican</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="5.4">governor government figure in a Bundy</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="5.46">situation my gosh it&amp;#39;s civil war so</text>

  <text start="276.09" dur="2.94">these guys are in you know they know</text>
  <text start="277.59" dur="2.52">they&amp;#39;re in the position of power they</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="2.34">may have to go through a little bit of</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="2.34">trouble they could even get arrested but</text>
  <text start="281.37" dur="3.96">they know they&amp;#39;re gonna win this fight</text>
  <text start="282.45" dur="5.7">in the in the you know in the campaign</text>
  <text start="285.33" dur="5.339">and the PR in the in the narrative you</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="5.69">know this is a huge power and bully move</text>
  <text start="290.669" dur="6.191">from like you know another Democrat to</text>
  <text start="293.84" dur="5.16">tantrum basically now interestingly</text>

  <text start="302.54" dur="6.24">information here it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s very</text>

  <text start="312.56" dur="2.54">Republicans and these militia said we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="3.51">protect them</text>
  <text start="315.1" dur="5.11">I&amp;#39;m sure there are militia types out</text>
  <text start="317.72" dur="4.77">there that that would be very serious</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="3.81">and dive for these people if they stood</text>
  <text start="322.49" dur="6.03">up and said this is wrong this is</text>
  <text start="324.02" dur="7.02">unconstitutional and we won&amp;#39;t have it so</text>
