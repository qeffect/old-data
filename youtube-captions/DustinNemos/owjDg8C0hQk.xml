  <text start="147.819" dur="5.041">showcases the crimes that Planned</text>
  <text start="150.34" dur="4.11">Parenthood and others are guilty of but</text>
  <text start="152.86" dur="5.01">first I want to get into some of these</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="5.28">other stories so the first one trump</text>
  <text start="157.87" dur="4.33">impeachment inquiry meant to discredit</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="5.02">bars investigation into spy gates as for</text>
  <text start="162.2" dur="6.09">FBI agent mark Ruskin now this is</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="5.879">something that I&amp;#39;ve actually been saying</text>
  <text start="168.29" dur="6.39">for a while I&amp;#39;ve been hinting at this</text>
  <text start="170.629" dur="7.711">where this impeachment proceeding is not</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="6.6">really real the Democrats know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="178.34" dur="7.47">real they know they will not be able to</text>
  <text start="181.28" dur="7.8">impeach President Trump number one there</text>
  <text start="185.81" dur="7.5">are no grounds for impeachment no real</text>
  <text start="189.08" dur="6.18">grounds number two they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="193.31" dur="5.91">proceeding in the way that they should</text>
  <text start="195.26" dur="6.809">be according to the law and number three</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="5.67">even if somehow they were able to get it</text>
  <text start="202.069" dur="5.041">past the house it will never pass the</text>
  <text start="204.89" dur="5.52">Senate the Senate will never sign off on</text>
  <text start="207.11" dur="9.599">this impeachment we have the Senate and</text>
  <text start="210.41" dur="9.389">that&amp;#39;s important however this is to</text>
  <text start="216.709" dur="7.171">their benefit because what it&amp;#39;s doing is</text>
  <text start="219.799" dur="9.72">it&amp;#39;s shaping the public opinion like I</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="6.96">said before in in theory it&amp;#39;s supposed</text>
  <text start="229.519" dur="3.541">to be you&amp;#39;re innocent until you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="230.84" dur="4.29">proven guilty however in reality that is</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="3.75">not the case if you&amp;#39;re accused of</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="5.729">something then automatically in the</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="5.7">minds of the people you are guilty this</text>
  <text start="240.859" dur="4.5">is just human nature if you were told</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="4.37">something if somebody is labeled as a</text>
  <text start="245.359" dur="5.25">criminal they&amp;#39;re being quote</text>
  <text start="246.88" dur="5.77">investigated then almost automatically</text>
  <text start="250.609" dur="6.481">everyone else will look at that person</text>
  <text start="252.65" dur="6.36">with suspicious eyes because why else</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="4.679">would they be under investigation they</text>
  <text start="259.01" dur="5.19">must have done something wrong right</text>
  <text start="261.769" dur="4.321">that is just human nature so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="264.2" dur="6.18">relying on the fact that they can shape</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="8.18">the public opinion by making up this</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="6.24">whole impeachment investigation scam</text>
  <text start="274.27" dur="4.89">additionally what Mark Ruskin is saying</text>
  <text start="276.62" dur="5.16">here is that it&amp;#39;s meant to discredit</text>
  <text start="279.16" dur="7.33">bars investigation into spying it which</text>
  <text start="281.78" dur="7.71">is going on right now as we speak so</text>
  <text start="286.49" dur="4.83">Barr and Durham are conducting an</text>
  <text start="289.49" dur="4.679">investigation into the investigators</text>
  <text start="291.32" dur="5.21">looking at the origins of the Russia</text>
  <text start="294.169" dur="7.471">hoax</text>
  <text start="296.53" dur="7.21">that is a real investigation now how are</text>
  <text start="301.64" dur="5.37">they going to counter that well they can</text>
  <text start="303.74" dur="5.1">claim that its political that the reason</text>
  <text start="307.01" dur="3.6">why this investigation is happening is</text>
  <text start="308.84" dur="6.81">because President Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="310.61" dur="9.21">avoid impeachment so he&amp;#39;s made up this</text>
  <text start="315.65" dur="9.53">investigation into the Russian hoax that</text>
  <text start="319.82" dur="9.84">is a strategy but it&amp;#39;s not going to work</text>
  <text start="325.18" dur="8.41">because facts are facts they will never</text>
  <text start="329.66" dur="9.93">lie now what will be necessary is that</text>
  <text start="333.59" dur="8.97">these facts be made entirely public as a</text>
  <text start="339.59" dur="6.86">side note the IG report for the FISA was</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="7.11">supposed to come out this Friday and</text>
  <text start="346.45" dur="6.85">it&amp;#39;s funny because as soon as I had said</text>
  <text start="349.67" dur="6.66">that after Maria Bartiromo had said that</text>
  <text start="353.3" dur="8.34">her sources had said that it was coming</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="7.68">out on Friday one of my viewers here had</text>
  <text start="361.64" dur="4.14">said that that wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen</text>
  <text start="364.01" dur="3.6">they were gonna put it off something was</text>
  <text start="365.78" dur="4.35">going to happen and lo and behold that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.61" dur="5.94">exactly what happened now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.13" dur="4.89">claiming that it may come out at the end</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="6.6">of the month because they need to make</text>
  <text start="375.02" dur="10.22">some classifications just release the</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="8.87">report already the people need to know</text>
  <text start="385.24" dur="7.24">everything needs to be made public right</text>
  <text start="389.02" dur="7.45">now when it comes to the IG report and</text>
  <text start="392.48" dur="5.91">the FISA and all of that it has to be</text>
  <text start="396.47" dur="4.98">made public we&amp;#39;ve already went through</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="6.95">this before where parts of the FISA had</text>
  <text start="401.45" dur="6.06">come out but it was largely redacted</text>
  <text start="405.34" dur="6.58">most of it you couldn&amp;#39;t even read</text>
  <text start="407.51" dur="9.47">because it was all blacked out we need</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="11.34">transparency in this country we need it</text>
  <text start="416.98" dur="7.63">quickly now when it comes to Bar and</text>
  <text start="423.26" dur="3.48">Durham and their investigation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.61" dur="4.14">going on right now</text>
  <text start="426.74" dur="3.6">that of course is taking a considerable</text>
  <text start="428.75" dur="3.51">amount of time and of course I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="430.34" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s because they need to make sure</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="7.86">that they are covering all their bases</text>
  <text start="436.46" dur="7.05">so that this is airtight so when it is</text>
  <text start="440.12" dur="6.06">all said and done the people can be held</text>
  <text start="443.51" dur="5.19">accountable those who are involved in</text>
  <text start="446.18" dur="4.05">this will be held accountable and these</text>
  <text start="448.7" dur="4.68">are very serious crimes</text>
  <text start="450.23" dur="5.04">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of debate going on as</text>
  <text start="453.38" dur="4.44">to whether or not this is treason or can</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="4.35">be considered treason when you look at</text>
  <text start="457.82" dur="7.71">the definition of treason in the</text>
  <text start="459.62" dur="9.27">Constitution my interpretation of this</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="3.93">of treason where it says overthrow of</text>
  <text start="468.89" dur="4.2">the government</text>
  <text start="469.46" dur="5.97">it never states whether or not that has</text>
  <text start="473.09" dur="6.78">to be an overthrow by force physical</text>
  <text start="475.43" dur="8.61">force an overthrow is an overthrow this</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="6.2">is an attempted coup it has been an</text>
  <text start="484.04" dur="9.3">attempted cube since the very beginning</text>
  <text start="486.07" dur="9.94">that was the intent so perhaps now we</text>
  <text start="493.34" dur="8.97">have very different strategies than back</text>
  <text start="496.01" dur="8.25">then now instead of gathering together a</text>
  <text start="502.31" dur="5.55">small army and overthrowing the</text>
  <text start="504.26" dur="8.07">government by that way instead you do it</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="10.52">by more covert means it is still an</text>
  <text start="512.33" dur="6.05">overthrow the outcome is still the same</text>
  <text start="519.55" dur="5.47">so for that reason in my opinion and I</text>
  <text start="523.16" dur="4.26">know some of you may disagree and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="525.02" dur="4.71">okay but in my opinion and this is just</text>
  <text start="527.42" dur="7.08">my opinion this is treason</text>
  <text start="529.73" dur="7.23">and that is why anyone who is involved</text>
  <text start="534.5" dur="12.06">in this is going to extreme lengths</text>
  <text start="536.96" dur="11.55">right now to avoid the accountability so</text>
  <text start="546.56" dur="5.25">they want to discredit this whole thing</text>
  <text start="548.51" dur="6.48">and that&amp;#39;s what Mark Reston is saying so</text>
  <text start="551.81" dur="5.23">I agree with that okay in other news</text>

  <text start="722.87" dur="5.07">out more information than what is being</text>
  <text start="725.53" dur="6.37">implied here in this article because</text>
  <text start="727.94" dur="6.53">they talk about kickbacks that sort of</text>
  <text start="731.9" dur="7.14">thing making money money laundering but</text>
  <text start="734.47" dur="7.66">there&amp;#39;s more to this and I think this is</text>
  <text start="739.04" dur="8.49">going to get very interesting so as we</text>
  <text start="742.13" dur="9.26">know of course Huber and his team of 416</text>
  <text start="747.53" dur="6.27">have been diligently working on</text>

  <text start="769.49" dur="4.98">though his work is ongoing</text>
  <text start="771.85" dur="6.07">why is he quiet about it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="774.47" dur="6.99">got to be airtight the same reason why</text>
  <text start="777.92" dur="8.33">Durham and bar are largely quiet about</text>

  <text start="829.11" dur="10.73">of the Clintons okay so what I want to</text>
  <text start="833.91" dur="10.02">say about this is that in this article</text>
  <text start="839.84" dur="6.7">they mention about how Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="843.93" dur="7.23">and Bill Clinton they were going around</text>
  <text start="846.54" dur="11.16">promoting these medications singing</text>
  <text start="851.16" dur="10.59">their praises here&amp;#39;s the thing they</text>
  <text start="857.7" dur="10.19">likely knew that these medications were</text>
  <text start="861.75" dur="13.74">fake and did not care because their work</text>
  <text start="867.89" dur="9.7">their aides work was a fraud as well so</text>
  <text start="875.49" dur="2.94">of course promoting these medications is</text>
  <text start="877.59" dur="3.81">a perfect cover</text>
  <text start="878.43" dur="4.65">yes we&amp;#39;re involved in spreading these</text>
  <text start="881.4" dur="4.32">medications to these impoverished</text>
  <text start="883.08" dur="4.92">communities to help them with their AIDS</text>

  <text start="902.28" dur="12.47">shop for charitable work in aids or hubs</text>
  <text start="908.85" dur="9.27">for human trafficking think about this</text>
  <text start="914.75" dur="5.62">back after Bill Clinton left office and</text>
  <text start="918.12" dur="4.92">then he went on this incredible mission</text>
  <text start="920.37" dur="5.22">they talked about it on 60 minutes years</text>
  <text start="923.04" dur="4.83">ago they highlighted it where he went on</text>
  <text start="925.59" dur="6.33">this incredible mission to a place</text>
  <text start="927.87" dur="4.71">called the Golden Triangle to do AIDS</text>
  <text start="931.92" dur="3.09">work</text>
  <text start="932.58" dur="5.31">oh he flew there on a private plane</text>
  <text start="935.01" dur="4.95">likely the epstein plane why do I think</text>
  <text start="937.89" dur="7.56">that because he did the same thing in</text>
  <text start="939.96" dur="11.24">Africa he flew on Epstein&amp;#39;s plane with</text>
  <text start="945.45" dur="5.75">Kevin Spacey to do AIDS work</text>

  <text start="954.81" dur="6.78">traffickers</text>
  <text start="955.86" dur="7.17">proven so what I think is going to be</text>
  <text start="961.59" dur="3.18">the most interesting thing to come out</text>
  <text start="963.03" dur="3.09">of this is not that they received</text>
  <text start="964.77" dur="3.39">kickbacks that&amp;#39;s no surprise</text>
  <text start="966.12" dur="3.81">everybody knows they&amp;#39;ve been taking</text>
  <text start="968.16" dur="4.8">kickbacks for years they&amp;#39;ve that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="969.93" dur="4.59">they make their money they&amp;#39;re crooked</text>
  <text start="972.96" dur="3.93">they&amp;#39;re crooks that&amp;#39;s how they make</text>
  <text start="974.52" dur="6.44">money the most interesting thing that</text>
  <text start="976.89" dur="7.95">will come out of this is if somehow</text>
  <text start="980.96" dur="6.28">these brothers come out about the true</text>
  <text start="984.84" dur="4.5">nature of their work in these places</text>
  <text start="987.24" dur="5.07">where they were supposedly doing charity</text>
  <text start="989.34" dur="6.84">work for eight because they&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="992.31" dur="6.03">frauds the Clintons were setting up shop</text>
  <text start="996.18" dur="4.98">using AIDS as a cover so they could</text>
  <text start="998.34" dur="6.45">traffic those who are vulnerable in</text>
  <text start="1001.16" dur="6.62">those areas and at the same time these</text>
  <text start="1004.79" dur="5.91">brothers who have this pharmaceutical</text>
  <text start="1007.78" dur="4.81">organization they were peddling fake</text>
  <text start="1010.7" dur="6.9">medications they knew they were fake but</text>
  <text start="1012.59" dur="8.48">they were making money off of it they</text>
  <text start="1017.6" dur="6.9">were all working together on this scam</text>
  <text start="1021.07" dur="6.1">the whole aids crusade by the Clintons</text>
  <text start="1024.5" dur="7.8">and their associates was a scam so they</text>
  <text start="1027.17" dur="9.72">could make money traffic the people who</text>
  <text start="1032.3" dur="11.43">live there for their own profit and take</text>
  <text start="1036.89" dur="8.52">whatever resources were there so I will</text>
  <text start="1043.73" dur="5.31">be interested to see you what comes out</text>
  <text start="1045.41" dur="6.72">of this but it&amp;#39;s likely that these</text>
  <text start="1049.04" dur="8.64">brothers will sing they will likely rat</text>
  <text start="1052.13" dur="9">on the Clintons okay now I want to talk</text>
  <text start="1057.68" dur="6.54">about updates on the delight in case</text>
  <text start="1061.13" dur="6.36">this is one of the biggest stories right</text>
  <text start="1064.22" dur="7.17">now that is not getting as much traction</text>
  <text start="1067.49" dur="6.99">as it should it is not getting as much</text>
  <text start="1071.39" dur="5.4">air time as it should no one is really</text>
  <text start="1074.48" dur="4.38">talking about this now with a few</text>
  <text start="1076.79" dur="5.52">exceptions of course LifeSite News is</text>
  <text start="1078.86" dur="6.99">covering it they are a conservative</text>
  <text start="1082.31" dur="5.43">pro-life news site a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1085.85" dur="3.84">alternative media isn&amp;#39;t really covering</text>
  <text start="1087.74" dur="3.15">it and definitely mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="1089.69" dur="3.56">covering it you can also find</text>
  <text start="1090.89" dur="6.72">information on Liberty councils website</text>
  <text start="1093.25" dur="6.58">Liberty Council is part of the defense</text>
  <text start="1097.61" dur="6.11">team for Sandra Merritt in the civil</text>
  <text start="1099.83" dur="7.02">case that is happening right now so I</text>
  <text start="1103.72" dur="7.21">found a few interesting things about</text>
  <text start="1106.85" dur="9.9">this case I talked earlier about how</text>
  <text start="1110.93" dur="10.65">judge auric actually hand-picked the</text>
  <text start="1116.75" dur="9.6">jury for this trial which is really</text>
  <text start="1121.58" dur="7.35">unheard of that is not something that is</text>
  <text start="1126.35" dur="4.89">supposed to happen in a court of law so</text>
  <text start="1128.93" dur="6.06">the judge he picked he hand-picked the</text>
  <text start="1131.24" dur="6.93">jury in addition he&amp;#39;s linked to Planned</text>
  <text start="1134.99" dur="7.2">Parenthood how do we know he&amp;#39;s linked to</text>
  <text start="1138.17" dur="6.27">Planned Parenthood because he had funded</text>
  <text start="1142.19" dur="6.06">the opening of a Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1144.44" dur="9.39">site within a Family Resource Center</text>
  <text start="1148.25" dur="9.33">that he was a board member of that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1153.83" dur="7.14">pretty obvious link and he should recuse</text>
  <text start="1157.58" dur="6.42">himself but he refused to do so now</text>
  <text start="1160.97" dur="8.19">another thing I found out about judge</text>
  <text start="1164" dur="9.06">boric is that he was also the judge in a</text>
  <text start="1169.16" dur="10.65">case against David daleiden three years</text>
  <text start="1173.06" dur="9.72">ago that case was between David daleiden</text>
  <text start="1179.81" dur="5.04">and the National Abortion Federation and</text>
  <text start="1182.78" dur="5.85">the National Abortion Federation was</text>
  <text start="1184.85" dur="5.67">also filmed in his human capital project</text>
  <text start="1188.63" dur="3.93">which by the way just as a reminder if</text>
  <text start="1190.52" dur="4.32">you stick to the end I will be showing</text>
  <text start="1192.56" dur="4.8">one of those videos just one there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1194.84" dur="7.65">total of 15 videos but I&amp;#39;m going to show</text>
  <text start="1197.36" dur="9.57">this one today in full so the judge had</text>
  <text start="1202.49" dur="6.69">overseen that case where National</text>
  <text start="1206.93" dur="4.47">Abortion Federation had said that David</text>
  <text start="1209.18" dur="6.63">daleiden had filmed them and had</text>
  <text start="1211.4" dur="7.47">violated their privacy and violated</text>
  <text start="1215.81" dur="6.119">their rights to confidentiality David</text>
  <text start="1218.87" dur="6.389">daleiden had said that he was acting</text>
  <text start="1221.929" dur="5.25">an investigative journalist so what do</text>
  <text start="1225.259" dur="5.79">investigative journalists do while they</text>
  <text start="1227.179" dur="6.301">go undercover so that they can cover</text>
  <text start="1231.049" dur="4.561">stories that normally they wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1233.48" dur="4.62">able to because everything is kept so</text>
  <text start="1235.61" dur="6.149">secret so of course if you are</text>
  <text start="1238.1" dur="5.49">investigating criminal activity you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1241.759" dur="9.831">not going to be able to be upfront about</text>
  <text start="1243.59" dur="10.469">that imagine let&amp;#39;s say if you are in</text>
  <text start="1251.59" dur="8.89">investigative journalists and you want</text>
  <text start="1254.059" dur="8.041">to follow around a corrupt politician so</text>
  <text start="1260.48" dur="5.34">that you can figure out whether or not</text>
  <text start="1262.1" dur="6.029">they are engaged in illegal activity</text>
  <text start="1265.82" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;re not going to go up to them as an</text>
  <text start="1268.129" dur="4.92">investigative journalist because this is</text>
  <text start="1269.69" dur="7.469">a public figure so obviously they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1273.049" dur="5.941">gonna want to hide their negative</text>
  <text start="1277.159" dur="3.72">aspects their negative characteristics</text>
  <text start="1278.99" dur="3.72">so an investigative journalist is not</text>
  <text start="1280.879" dur="4.711">going to be able to go up to this</text>
  <text start="1282.71" dur="4.409">politician and say hey excuse me I was</text>
  <text start="1285.59" dur="4.079">wondering if I could follow you around</text>
  <text start="1287.119" dur="5.341">for about a month or so so I can figure</text>
  <text start="1289.669" dur="8.96">out whether or not your activities are</text>
  <text start="1292.46" dur="8.73">legit either they&amp;#39;re gonna be told no or</text>
  <text start="1298.629" dur="4.691">the entire month that they&amp;#39;re following</text>
  <text start="1301.19" dur="5.64">around that politician that politician</text>
  <text start="1303.32" dur="10.349">is going to be acting in a way that they</text>
  <text start="1306.83" dur="8.219">normally don&amp;#39;t to make it appear that</text>
  <text start="1313.669" dur="3.6">they are not engaged in criminal</text>
  <text start="1315.049" dur="2.901">activity because they know what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1317.269" dur="3.061">there for</text>
  <text start="1317.95" dur="4.479">so it doesn&amp;#39;t work that way so if you</text>
  <text start="1320.33" dur="4.62">want to expose corruption if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1322.429" dur="3.96">investigating something then this</text>
  <text start="1324.95" dur="2.819">journalist is going to go undercover</text>
  <text start="1326.389" dur="4.591">which is exactly what these</text>
  <text start="1327.769" dur="3.841">investigative journalists did and they</text>
  <text start="1330.98" dur="4.889">went all out</text>
  <text start="1331.61" dur="7.38">they even posed as a fetal tissue</text>
  <text start="1335.869" dur="5.19">procurement company called bio max they</text>
  <text start="1338.99" dur="5.009">created a company just so they can go</text>
  <text start="1341.059" dur="4.95">undercover and gain access to these</text>
  <text start="1343.999" dur="4.13">individuals so that those individuals</text>
  <text start="1346.009" dur="6.8">can then really reveal who they are</text>
  <text start="1348.129" dur="4.68">which is what happened in these videos</text>
  <text start="1353.109" dur="7.261">but</text>
  <text start="1355.03" dur="12.12">in that case they were sued it did not</text>
  <text start="1360.37" dur="9.06">end in their favor and in fact as a part</text>
  <text start="1367.15" dur="6.72">of that case there was an amicus brief</text>
  <text start="1369.43" dur="7.86">that was put forward by 18 quote-unquote</text>
  <text start="1373.87" dur="7.68">journalists experts journalists right</text>
  <text start="1377.29" dur="6.9">and these expert journalists wrote this</text>
  <text start="1381.55" dur="5.61">an amicus brief stating that David</text>
  <text start="1384.19" dur="6.81">daleiden was not a legitimate</text>
  <text start="1387.16" dur="7.65">journalists they discredited him and the</text>
  <text start="1391" dur="6.81">purpose of that was so that then the</text>
  <text start="1394.81" dur="5.4">entire case would fall apart but he</text>
  <text start="1397.81" dur="3.9">could not say oh I was engaged in</text>
  <text start="1400.21" dur="3.12">investigative journalism because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1401.71" dur="5.07">not a real old journalist according to</text>
  <text start="1403.33" dur="7.8">this amicus brief and by the way this</text>
  <text start="1406.78" dur="8.34">amicus brief very interesting all of</text>
  <text start="1411.13" dur="8.22">these leading journalists every single</text>
  <text start="1415.12" dur="8.73">one of them or part of a leftist</text>
  <text start="1419.35" dur="8.61">University oh and by the way Robert</text>
  <text start="1423.85" dur="6.6">Steele is in this as well so Robert</text>
  <text start="1427.96" dur="5.31">Steele had also contributed to this</text>
  <text start="1430.45" dur="5.64">amicus brief that ultimately discredited</text>
  <text start="1433.27" dur="6.03">David daleiden so that he would lose</text>
  <text start="1436.09" dur="7.17">that case against the National Abortion</text>
  <text start="1439.3" dur="7.2">Federation and of course his appeal to</text>
  <text start="1443.26" dur="6.21">the Supreme Court was denied and they</text>
  <text start="1446.5" dur="7.98">were never allowed to release the videos</text>
  <text start="1449.47" dur="12.29">for evidence same thing happened in this</text>
  <text start="1454.48" dur="11.43">case so recently the judge judge auric</text>
  <text start="1461.76" dur="6.43">the same judge from that other case who</text>
  <text start="1465.91" dur="4.32">is now overseeing the case Planned</text>
  <text start="1468.19" dur="4.34">Parenthood versus David daleiden Sandra</text>
  <text start="1470.23" dur="8.04">Mayer and their associates</text>
  <text start="1472.53" dur="7.9">he banned video evidence he will not</text>
  <text start="1478.27" dur="4.17">allow the video footage that was</text>
  <text start="1480.43" dur="5.78">produced in that project to be put forth</text>
  <text start="1482.44" dur="3.77">so the jury can view it</text>
  <text start="1486.92" dur="7.53">so the jury isn&amp;#39;t able to see why these</text>
  <text start="1490.43" dur="6.15">journalists wanted to go undercover so</text>
  <text start="1494.45" dur="5.57">there&amp;#39;s no probable cause there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1496.58" dur="9.84">reason for them to be videotaping</text>
  <text start="1500.02" dur="8.86">conversations so with that the case is</text>
  <text start="1506.42" dur="4.35">not looking good for them because</text>
  <text start="1508.88" dur="6.84">they&amp;#39;re not allowed to present these</text>
  <text start="1510.77" dur="9.81">videos now of course in the latest</text>
  <text start="1515.72" dur="8.06">updates Planned Parenthood had brought</text>
  <text start="1520.58" dur="9.5">forth several abortionists as witnesses</text>
  <text start="1523.78" dur="12.55">stating that they had to hire security</text>
  <text start="1530.08" dur="8.29">they had to buy new equipment purchase</text>
  <text start="1536.33" dur="6.51">equipment to secure their facilities</text>
  <text start="1538.37" dur="7.65">because they feared for their life they</text>
  <text start="1542.84" dur="5.04">were saying that they never wanted their</text>
  <text start="1546.02" dur="3.36">work to be revealed to the public</text>
  <text start="1547.88" dur="3.27">because that could put them in danger</text>
  <text start="1549.38" dur="3.99">and of course they&amp;#39;re citing the</text>
  <text start="1551.15" dur="4.34">incident where someone had went to a</text>
  <text start="1553.37" dur="6.96">Planned Parenthood facility and had</text>
  <text start="1555.49" dur="8.59">fired shots so they&amp;#39;re saying that they</text>
  <text start="1560.33" dur="6.87">feared for their life now of course they</text>
  <text start="1564.08" dur="6.36">were cross-examined and it was found</text>
  <text start="1567.2" dur="5.01">that they weren&amp;#39;t actually worried about</text>
  <text start="1570.44" dur="3.45">hiding what they did because they were</text>
  <text start="1572.21" dur="4.53">very public about it it was all over the</text>
  <text start="1573.89" dur="5.36">internet so although they tried to</text>
  <text start="1576.74" dur="4.65">present themselves as being fearful and</text>
  <text start="1579.25" dur="4.54">that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why they had</text>
  <text start="1581.39" dur="4.76">to sue because violation of privacy</text>
  <text start="1583.79" dur="6.15">they&amp;#39;re trying to remain private</text>
  <text start="1586.15" dur="8.64">well actually at least one of these</text>
  <text start="1589.94" dur="7.39">abortionists had signed publicly a</text>

  <text start="1635.429" dur="5.21">I think it&amp;#39;s very important that people</text>
  <text start="1640.879" dur="8.351">understand really what the purpose of</text>
  <text start="1645.899" dur="6.931">this whole project was for it was meant</text>
  <text start="1649.23" dur="11.309">to expose Planned Parenthood and other</text>
  <text start="1652.83" dur="12.689">abortion industry organizations to show</text>
  <text start="1660.539" dur="9.27">that they break the law to make profit</text>

  <text start="1679.889" dur="9.181">trafficking it is not allowed in</text>
  <text start="1685.369" dur="5.56">addition in the preliminary hearing it</text>
  <text start="1689.07" dur="4.919">came out and of course this is why a gag</text>
  <text start="1690.929" dur="5.73">order was placed immediately after this</text>
  <text start="1693.989" dur="9.69">testimony where they had talked about</text>
  <text start="1696.659" dur="10.26">how live births occurred a lot of times</text>
  <text start="1703.679" dur="13.73">because they wanted to harvest live</text>
  <text start="1706.919" dur="14.64">organs imagine a live birth and then</text>
  <text start="1717.409" dur="7.02">they cut into this living baby to</text>
  <text start="1721.559" dur="2.87">harvest their organs</text>
  <text start="1725.32" dur="7.6">hugely unethical in addition to being</text>
  <text start="1728.84" dur="6.84">illegal huge violation of Human Rights</text>
  <text start="1732.92" dur="6.78">because that&amp;#39;s what that baby is it is a</text>
  <text start="1735.68" dur="6.09">human being now I want to show this</text>
  <text start="1739.7" dur="6.3">video and this is just one of many there</text>
  <text start="1741.77" dur="7.44">are several several videos 15 in total</text>
  <text start="1746" dur="5.61">and of course I&amp;#39;ll put the link in the</text>
  <text start="1749.21" dur="3.69">description below for the Center for</text>
  <text start="1751.61" dur="3">medical progress where you can view all</text>
  <text start="1752.9" dur="3.81">of the videos but I want to highlight</text>
  <text start="1754.61" dur="3.42">this one in case you haven&amp;#39;t seen any of</text>
  <text start="1756.71" dur="6.8">them and I&amp;#39;m going to show it in full</text>
  <text start="1758.03" dur="7.89">now what I want to note here is that</text>
  <text start="1763.51" dur="7.23">there are a couple things number one</text>
  <text start="1765.92" dur="11.01">when they talk about breach breach a</text>
  <text start="1770.74" dur="11.05">position that is not legal you are not</text>
  <text start="1776.93" dur="9.99">supposed to have a baby and breach to be</text>
  <text start="1781.79" dur="12.45">delivered that way it places the patient</text>
  <text start="1786.92" dur="9.18">in danger in regular practice if a woman</text>
  <text start="1794.24" dur="4.35">is in labor they will do everything they</text>
  <text start="1796.1" dur="4.14">can to make sure that the baby is not in</text>
  <text start="1798.59" dur="6.15">breech position because that is</text>
  <text start="1800.24" dur="8.1">dangerous it can cause damage permanent</text>
  <text start="1804.74" dur="8.66">damage to the patient and of course they</text>
  <text start="1808.34" dur="9.65">do this without consent that is illegal</text>
  <text start="1813.4" dur="4.59">they don&amp;#39;t care about women&amp;#39;s rights</text>
  <text start="1818.35" dur="7.63">that is a farce so that&amp;#39;s number one</text>
  <text start="1821.15" dur="10.41">number two this lady at one point she</text>
  <text start="1825.98" dur="9.78">mentions that she also held an academic</text>
  <text start="1831.56" dur="6.87">teaching position at USC I find that</text>
  <text start="1835.76" dur="4.83">very interesting and this woman she is a</text>
  <text start="1838.43" dur="5.04">medical director for Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="1840.59" dur="6.75">I find this very interesting because in</text>
  <text start="1843.47" dur="7.05">that amicus brief where they discredited</text>
  <text start="1847.34" dur="5.78">David daleiden so that that case would</text>
  <text start="1850.52" dur="6.24">not rule in his favor</text>
  <text start="1853.12" dur="8.34">they were all from universities</text>
  <text start="1856.76" dur="9.6">leftist universities imagine how many</text>
  <text start="1861.46" dur="8.91">more from the abortion industry are</text>
  <text start="1866.36" dur="12.81">actually working as an academic</text>
  <text start="1870.37" dur="13.33">professor at those universities this</text>
  <text start="1879.17" dur="7.23">case is hugely rigged so anyway I want</text>
  <text start="1883.7" dur="4.74">to show this video now I do want to tell</text>
  <text start="1886.4" dur="4.11">you ahead of time that the first few</text>
  <text start="1888.44" dur="4.95">seconds of this the sound is a little</text>
  <text start="1890.51" dur="6.24">bit too sorted so just bear with me for</text>
  <text start="1893.39" dur="4.83">a minute and then it really smooths out</text>
  <text start="1896.75" dur="3.45">it smooths out the soundness but I</text>
  <text start="1898.22" dur="3.21">wanted to warn you ahead of time that</text>
  <text start="1900.2" dur="3.9">there is some distortion in the</text>
  <text start="1901.43" dur="4.35">beginning but this whole video is very</text>
  <text start="1904.1" dur="4.26">worth your while it&amp;#39;s about 12 minutes</text>
  <text start="1905.78" dur="4.32">long but definitely worth your time and</text>
  <text start="1908.36" dur="3.69">if you&amp;#39;re interested in viewing the</text>
  <text start="1910.1" dur="4.05">other videos you can find the link to</text>

  <text start="1914.15" dur="9.57">have a look at this but the reason it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1921.89" dur="3.21">a controversial place is because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1923.72" dur="2.37">the country&amp;#39;s biggest abortion provider</text>
  <text start="1925.1" dur="2.46">and you&amp;#39;re one of the people who run it</text>
  <text start="1926.09" dur="3.06">and so I just want to know what you</text>
  <text start="1927.56" dur="3.33">think if you can hear the fetal</text>
  <text start="1929.15" dur="2.94">heartbeat and then it&amp;#39;s extinguished</text>
  <text start="1930.89" dur="3.29">what do you think of that is that a big</text>
  <text start="1932.09" dur="5.61">deal or not to you and if not why not</text>
  <text start="1934.18" dur="5.14">well I take seriously all of the</text>
