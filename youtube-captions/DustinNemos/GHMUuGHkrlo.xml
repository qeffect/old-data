  <text start="341.45" dur="5.76">he&amp;#39;s a big one because he&amp;#39;s well-known</text>

  <text start="360.5" dur="3.63">to the world although I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="362.51" dur="3.57">that&amp;#39;s the appropriate reaction I think</text>
  <text start="364.13" dur="4.23">we should just kind of press the issue</text>
  <text start="366.08" dur="5.01">of hey by the way child trafficking</text>
  <text start="368.36" dur="5.4">really is real look at this and we need</text>
  <text start="371.09" dur="4.77">to talk about this I mean what issue is</text>
  <text start="373.76" dur="3.69">more important than that and the damage</text>

  <text start="400.58" dur="5.179">Rachel Chandler I mean that&amp;#39;s nexium</text>
  <text start="402.229" dur="5.94">times a thousand that&amp;#39;s way bigger and</text>
  <text start="405.759" dur="5.71">why did he build a temple on his Island</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="6.81">again why does it have multiple stories</text>
  <text start="411.469" dur="5.55">of like chambers below it what was in</text>
  <text start="414.979" dur="3.84">that weird secret box that he had that</text>
  <text start="417.019" dur="4.88">no one was allowed like the safe box</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="3.08">that no one was allowed into</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="10.709">yeah yeah Rachel Chandler we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="436.43" dur="5.9">kind of covered that one for a while and</text>
  <text start="439.789" dur="4.59">you know officials are saying that</text>
  <text start="442.33" dur="4.44">they&amp;#39;re expecting him to be a</text>
  <text start="444.379" dur="5.22">placeholder for many more indictments</text>
  <text start="446.77" dur="4.299">obviously he&amp;#39;s ahe&amp;#39;s it he&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="449.599" dur="2.88">those people that&amp;#39;s kind of sitting at</text>
  <text start="451.069" dur="3.75">this at the center of a lot of the</text>
  <text start="452.479" dur="5.071">blackmail he&amp;#39;s got a book full of names</text>
  <text start="454.819" dur="4.59">he&amp;#39;s got a secret box stashed somewhere</text>
  <text start="457.55" dur="5.91">full of tapes you know and he&amp;#39;s got dirt</text>
  <text start="459.409" dur="5.1">on everybody now the real question here</text>
  <text start="463.46" dur="4.56">all right</text>
  <text start="464.509" dur="5.34">is is he as some are a legate you know</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="6.239">some allegations are being made that</text>
  <text start="469.849" dur="6.301">he&amp;#39;s a Mossad kind of honeypot trap</text>
  <text start="474.259" dur="4.861">agent you know like he&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="476.15" dur="5.79">state-sponsored you know I can&amp;#39;t verify</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="4.229">that but that is an allegation it you</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="2.64">know it makes sense to a degree that</text>
  <text start="483.349" dur="6.81">governments would do that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="7.44">I&amp;#39;m not discounting it we will see I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="490.159" dur="5.781">very careful about all things Mossad</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="3.92">after my age a death threat</text>
  <text start="501.26" dur="4">well caffeine addict makes a good point</text>
  <text start="503.79" dur="3.12">Epstein is going down for someone</text>
  <text start="505.26" dur="5.76">probably bigger than him they all have a</text>
  <text start="506.91" dur="5.58">boss sure so Epstein&amp;#39;s thing is probably</text>
  <text start="511.02" dur="5.04">gonna be the rest of his life in prison</text>
  <text start="512.49" dur="6.299">so he does have sort of a a reason to</text>
  <text start="516.06" dur="4.44">want to risk a little bit of freedom to</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="5.271">stay out of that easy a man used to</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="6.24">certain comforts on the other hand if he</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="4.57">did turn on somebody stronger that was</text>
  <text start="526.74" dur="3.18">as powerful as that or even someone</text>
  <text start="528.63" dur="6.87">lower level like the Clintons he</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="7.11">probably in the dead shortly and I am</text>
  <text start="535.5" dur="3.51">not confident in the government&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.03" dur="3.75">ability to keep anyone alive except</text>
  <text start="539.01" dur="4.14">POTUS he seems to be immune to</text>
  <text start="540.78" dur="12.9">everything else but you know the NYC</text>
  <text start="543.15" dur="11.85">officers are dropping dead we always</text>
  <text start="553.68" dur="2.85">have such interesting like side</text>

  <text start="592.29" dur="4.23">partnered it out with an expert Patriot</text>
  <text start="594.03" dur="3.84">owned company but those funds are going</text>
  <text start="596.52" dur="2.88">to start to trickle in and go toward</text>
  <text start="597.87" dur="4.07">alternative health projects so I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="599.4" dur="2.54">excited about that</text>

  <text start="618.44" dur="4.69">don&amp;#39;t know just a reminder that things</text>
  <text start="620.79" dur="3.54">get really bad in cities sometimes when</text>
  <text start="623.13" dur="3.78">the power goes out but it was</text>
  <text start="624.33" dur="4.53">fortunately pretty quick it is</text>

  <text start="642.129" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t have much comment on it probably</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="3.869">caused all sorts of problems like</text>

  <text start="685.09" dur="5.31">right now that they&amp;#39;re falling apart</text>
  <text start="688.2" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s why I said it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost a</text>
  <text start="690.4" dur="6.06">done deal I mean they were this was not</text>

  <text start="3523.61" dur="4.74">the famous spotty study and it was a</text>

  <text start="3858.94" dur="4.65">depends from a legal perspective yeah in</text>
  <text start="3862.06" dur="3.9">theory you should be able to take</text>
  <text start="3863.59" dur="4.47">someone like that down with hard</text>
  <text start="3865.96" dur="3.78">evidence of videos but on the other hand</text>
  <text start="3868.06" dur="3.9">how do you take someone like that down</text>
  <text start="3869.74" dur="3.69">that powerful without a public takedown</text>
  <text start="3871.96" dur="3.99">and how do you have a public takedown</text>
  <text start="3873.43" dur="5.94">with a child porn video so it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="3875.95" dur="5.19">difficult to shift that that how do you</text>
  <text start="3879.37" dur="4.37">shift public opinion without sharing the</text>
  <text start="3881.14" dur="5.31">video because you can&amp;#39;t share that video</text>
  <text start="3883.74" dur="4.48">the video existing is enough for them to</text>
  <text start="3886.45" dur="4.02">do the prosecution but the prosecution</text>
  <text start="3888.22" dur="3.57">probably wouldn&amp;#39;t win without a lot of</text>
  <text start="3890.47" dur="3">people mad at them so they need to</text>
  <text start="3891.79" dur="3.39">understand things like Epstein anyway he</text>
  <text start="3893.47" dur="3.63">need to see these things they need to</text>
  <text start="3895.18" dur="4.46">build these links and come to it their</text>
  <text start="3897.1" dur="5.22">own in their own time their own minds</text>
  <text start="3899.64" dur="4.21">otherwise they they won&amp;#39;t buy it they</text>
  <text start="3902.32" dur="3.09">won&amp;#39;t they won&amp;#39;t go for it and Hillary</text>
  <text start="3903.85" dur="6.36">would have this big fight and she might</text>
  <text start="3905.41" dur="8.36">even win that&amp;#39;s why the Overton Window</text>
  <text start="3910.21" dur="3.56">stuff is so darn important</text>
  <text start="3920.18" dur="4.18">looking up says does anyone else think</text>
  <text start="3922.35" dur="4.23">Epstein and Obama have similar facial</text>
  <text start="3924.36" dur="3.72">features same bloodline I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3926.58" dur="4.8">about those two but remember how almost</text>
  <text start="3928.08" dur="6.93">every president was related that 11 year</text>
  <text start="3931.38" dur="5.07">old girl I think it was had did a study</text>
  <text start="3935.01" dur="4.29">and she had found almost every single</text>
  <text start="3936.45" dur="4.44">one of them was related so you know</text>
  <text start="3939.3" dur="3.21">there obviously there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s layers</text>
  <text start="3940.89" dur="3.84">to this things guys I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3942.51" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s groups of power and there&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="3944.73" dur="3.66">so many people at those higher levels of</text>
  <text start="3947.01" dur="2.61">power anyways so half they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="3948.39" dur="3.63">related even if there are all different</text>
  <text start="3949.62" dur="3.72">teams so it&amp;#39;s very complicated at that</text>
  <text start="3952.02" dur="3.09">lovely you have to really know who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3953.34" dur="3.68">involved in white and know the players</text>
  <text start="3955.11" dur="3.78">and follow the money and all that stuff</text>
  <text start="3957.02" dur="3.4">but there are you know you could do</text>
  <text start="3958.89" dur="3.99">things like follow the money and then</text>
  <text start="3960.42" dur="4.83">you find the truth now Julie Vince says</text>
  <text start="3962.88" dur="6">should c60 be refrigerated no it does</text>
  <text start="3965.25" dur="6.18">not have to be at least the oils that I</text>
  <text start="3968.88" dur="6.42">sell like coconut oil and olive oil are</text>
  <text start="3971.43" dur="5.7">shelf-stable for many years so you</text>
  <text start="3975.3" dur="3.98">wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily have to although</text>
  <text start="3977.13" dur="4.65">maybe if you want if you like it cold</text>
  <text start="3979.28" dur="4.75">with coconut oil if you if you buy the</text>
  <text start="3981.78" dur="4.86">coconut oil c60 and it&amp;#39;s cold it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="3984.03" dur="4.14">solid so if you like it solid which I do</text>
  <text start="3986.64" dur="3.45">because I like to use it as a cream</text>
  <text start="3988.17" dur="4.92">sometimes like for my face or as a</text>
  <text start="3990.09" dur="6.3">lotion I like the solid stuff a little</text>
  <text start="3993.09" dur="6.84">bit less messy so I like the coconut oil</text>
  <text start="3996.39" dur="5.79">in the fridge when I&amp;#39;m drinking it I</text>
  <text start="3999.93" dur="5.37">like the liquid coconut oil so I like</text>
