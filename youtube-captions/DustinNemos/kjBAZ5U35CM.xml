  <text start="10.95" dur="4.68">trying out a new gadget I got today</text>
  <text start="12.719" dur="5.191">that&amp;#39;s kind of neat so now my my mic is</text>
  <text start="15.63" dur="5.58">up on an arm hopefully that&amp;#39;ll help the</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="4.8">sound a little bit I wanted to be a</text>
  <text start="21.21" dur="4.559">little bit quiet because she&amp;#39;s asleep</text>
  <text start="22.71" dur="4.71">but hopefully you can hear me okay so I</text>
  <text start="25.769" dur="4.59">want to talk about some important things</text>
  <text start="27.42" dur="5.04">but first this this really bears</text>
  <text start="30.359" dur="5.281">mentioning first and foremost there is a</text>
  <text start="32.46" dur="5.099">missing nuclear sub now the official</text>
  <text start="35.64" dur="3.239">story is it&amp;#39;s lost at sea maybe at the</text>
  <text start="37.559" dur="3.511">bottom of the sea and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="38.879" dur="3.811">recover it but I don&amp;#39;t follow the</text>
  <text start="41.07" dur="5.669">official story anymore when it comes to</text>
  <text start="42.69" dur="6.599">missing subs and missiles so please you</text>
  <text start="46.739" dur="4.261">know take what precautions you can and</text>
  <text start="49.289" dur="2.25">be aware that something could happen at</text>
  <text start="51" dur="3.449">any moment</text>
  <text start="51.539" dur="6.09">this is just speculation but we have a</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="7.981">missing Russian nuclear sub now getting</text>
  <text start="57.629" dur="7.231">into the news we have 51% of Republicans</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="3.439">now believe that the media is the enemy</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="3.84">of the people</text>
  <text start="65.869" dur="5.381">statisti Niall McCarthy notes a</text>
  <text start="68.7" dur="4.62">Quinnipiac University poll released last</text>
  <text start="71.25" dur="4.95">week found that a majority of</text>
  <text start="73.32" dur="4.799">Republicans consider the news media and</text>
  <text start="76.2" dur="4.59">enemy of the people rather than an</text>
  <text start="78.119" dur="5.101">important part of democracy I think it</text>
  <text start="80.79" dur="3.75">showed up about 5% of Democrats but you</text>
  <text start="83.22" dur="3.81">know that number will continue to grow</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="4.74">and that seemed a little bit low anyway</text>
  <text start="87.03" dur="4.47">because just think about we&amp;#39;ve doubled</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="3.54">black support for Trump in the last year</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="2.909">alone and we&amp;#39;ve had the walk away</text>
  <text start="92.82" dur="3.659">movement I feel like it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="5.311">higher than 5 you know these polls are</text>
  <text start="96.479" dur="5.46">not that reliable anyway another poll</text>
  <text start="99.72" dur="6.3">shows that America is really into the</text>
  <text start="101.939" dur="6.39">idea of debt Betsy divorces alternative</text>
  <text start="106.02" dur="5.01">to public schools you know she&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="6.811">some vouchers and things like that this</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="5.76">idea is getting a lot of support and it</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="4.589">could solve you know some of these</text>
  <text start="116.79" dur="5.009">inner-city school problems and break</text>
  <text start="119.729" dur="6.93">some of the thought control of some of</text>
  <text start="121.799" dur="6.99">these terrible schools and of course we</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="4.001">have Chuck Schumer and the Democrats</text>
  <text start="128.789" dur="4.871">moving to</text>
  <text start="130.66" dur="5.07">there goes them crazy cats I mean dogs</text>
  <text start="133.66" dur="4.26">you know what I mean</text>
  <text start="135.73" dur="4.62">I like to say cats cuz I&amp;#39;m so tired of</text>
  <text start="137.92" dur="4.35">them barking all the time we have Chuck</text>
  <text start="140.35" dur="4.56">Schumer Democrats moving to delay</text>
  <text start="142.27" dur="6.72">Cavanaugh hearings because Co hens plea</text>
  <text start="144.91" dur="6.54">implicated Trump in a crime so first of</text>
  <text start="148.99" dur="4.44">all they&amp;#39;re using this as an excuse to</text>
  <text start="151.45" dur="4.08">try to delay Trump more especially with</text>
  <text start="153.43" dur="4.71">the Supreme Court hearing and by the way</text>
  <text start="155.53" dur="7.19">apparently Cavanaugh is of the opinion</text>
  <text start="158.14" dur="7.62">you know this is from a a GOP moderate</text>
  <text start="162.72" dur="5.35">candidate having apparently spoken to</text>
  <text start="165.76" dur="4.05">him in private session but he&amp;#39;s of the</text>
  <text start="168.07" dur="3.45">opinion that roe v wade is a settled</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="4.26">legal matter so he may or may not</text>
  <text start="171.52" dur="5.58">overturn or be willing to overturn</text>
  <text start="174.07" dur="6.53">abortion anyway however they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="177.1" dur="6.57">to use it to delay his nomination and</text>
  <text start="180.6" dur="6.52">you know they&amp;#39;re just trying to use it</text>
  <text start="183.67" dur="5.51">as political ammo as as always but</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="4.41">remember that this is actually not</text>
  <text start="189.18" dur="5.5">anything that actually falls back on</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="4.47">Trump Kohan might have done some tax</text>
  <text start="194.68" dur="3.09">evasion and things like that just like</text>
  <text start="196" dur="4.32">manna fort has nothing to do with Trump</text>
  <text start="197.77" dur="5.37">and as far as the claim that he somehow</text>
  <text start="200.32" dur="4.83">created some sort of criminal violation</text>
  <text start="203.14" dur="4.2">of of something that&amp;#39;s actually just a</text>
  <text start="205.15" dur="4.44">civil matter you can look up the code</text>
  <text start="207.34" dur="4.56">for yourself there is no there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="209.59" dur="3.96">criminal violation Obama did the same</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="3.24">thing and paid a almost a four hundred</text>
  <text start="213.55" dur="4.23">thousand dollar fine and then that was</text>
  <text start="215.14" dur="5.01">it so even if they could somehow proof</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="6.36">Trump was actually violating campaign</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="6.84">finance laws which they can&amp;#39;t all this</text>
  <text start="224.14" dur="5.1">is is just a big gotcha game and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.99" dur="5.1">not actually even like a felony crime or</text>
  <text start="229.24" dur="4.59">anything like that so you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="3.119">going to get headlines out of it but</text>
  <text start="233.83" dur="2.4">nothing is actually going to come out of</text>
  <text start="235.209" dur="2.161">this they&amp;#39;re not going to get their big</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="6.18">impeachment they&amp;#39;re not going to get</text>
  <text start="237.37" dur="8.81">anything really now moving on we have</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="6.48">Elizabeth Warren when asked about the</text>
  <text start="246.18" dur="4.51">Molly Tibbett situation the girl who was</text>
  <text start="248.89" dur="4.2">murdered by the illegal immigrant she</text>
  <text start="250.69" dur="4.26">sort of just switched it up and tried to</text>
  <text start="253.09" dur="3.57">shift the focus to the kids at the</text>
  <text start="254.95" dur="5.73">border being separated from their mamas</text>
  <text start="256.66" dur="7.44">so this is a big a big smack in the face</text>
  <text start="260.68" dur="3.69">of the people who are mourning this poor</text>
  <text start="264.1" dur="3.75">girl</text>
  <text start="264.37" dur="6">death and I think the irony I&amp;#39;m hearing</text>
  <text start="267.85" dur="4.05">that this girl was actually kind of a</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="4.47">leftist so maybe some of the leftist</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="4.47">will actually you know this is not</text>
  <text start="274.84" dur="3.54">verified but if this is the case maybe</text>
  <text start="276.37" dur="4.56">some of them will sort of kind of feel</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="4.47">some more sympathy for the girl or maybe</text>
  <text start="280.93" dur="4.23">some kinship and maybe they&amp;#39;ll be like</text>
  <text start="282.85" dur="3.72">well how this could happen to me too I</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="6.15">don&amp;#39;t want to get killed by an illegal</text>
  <text start="286.57" dur="7.409">immigrant either but it is it is kind of</text>
  <text start="291.31" dur="4.65">disgusting and and shameful what</text>
  <text start="293.979" dur="6.181">Elizabeth Warren did with this response</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="5.75">and tried to turn it into politics in an</text>
  <text start="300.16" dur="3.96">attack Trump with it</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="4.66">Rand Paul is actually introducing an</text>
  <text start="304.12" dur="5.72">amendment to defund Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="306.37" dur="6.06">and get rid of state funding of abortion</text>
  <text start="309.84" dur="6.13">by state I mean federal government D</text>
  <text start="312.43" dur="5.37">state but yeah that would be very</text>
  <text start="315.97" dur="3.6">interesting that would be amazing and</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="3.69">you know these guys are basically</text>
  <text start="319.57" dur="4.319">butchering up babies for their parts to</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="3.63">sell I mean we have a guy right now I</text>
  <text start="323.889" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t remember his name off the top of</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="4.29">my head who&amp;#39;s trying to get the word out</text>
  <text start="327.639" dur="3.84">and he has some the most thing he says</text>
  <text start="329.41" dur="3.75">the most damning videos yet undercover</text>
  <text start="331.479" dur="4.261">videos about Planned Parenthood selling</text>
  <text start="333.16" dur="6.87">baby parts but he has a gag order and he</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="6.359">can&amp;#39;t share them yet so hopefully I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="340.03" dur="3.63">mentioned this before but hopefully in</text>
  <text start="342.099" dur="3.151">the future people will learn the lesson</text>
  <text start="343.66" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t try to sit on this stuff and give</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="5.28">them a chance to gag you get it out</text>
  <text start="346.99" dur="5.64">there please get it out there drop it on</text>
  <text start="350.53" dur="4.65">the internet anonymously drop it on the</text>
  <text start="352.63" dur="4.469">chance whatever you got to do there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.18" dur="4.59">ways to do this if you have to mail it</text>
  <text start="357.099" dur="4.891">to me anonymously whatever I&amp;#39;ll get it</text>
  <text start="359.77" dur="4.619">out there and I will be happy to go to</text>
  <text start="361.99" dur="3.66">jail to keep your name safe but you</text>
  <text start="364.389" dur="3.301">don&amp;#39;t even have to extend it to me send</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="4.47">it to James O&amp;#39;Keefe at the new Veritas</text>
  <text start="367.69" dur="3.78">leaks they have a whole leak set up now</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="4.079">where you can send things to them and</text>
  <text start="371.47" dur="4.29">James James O&amp;#39;Keefe will definitely take</text>
  <text start="374.199" dur="5.521">it to jail rather than give up your</text>
  <text start="375.76" dur="5.82">identity Donald Trump is saying that</text>
  <text start="379.72" dur="3.36">Americans deserve the same freedom of</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="3.48">speech as the media he&amp;#39;s been talking</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="4.32">about censorship a lot lately as I said</text>
  <text start="385.06" dur="6.3">guys he&amp;#39;s made he&amp;#39;s making the moves</text>
  <text start="387.4" dur="7.079">he&amp;#39;s starting to focus and shift the the</text>
  <text start="391.36" dur="4.739">public eye and the public narrative he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="394.479" dur="4.081">shifting that Overton Window over to the</text>
  <text start="396.099" dur="4.111">censorship topic now you know</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="3.63">people like Nancy Pelosi on Twitter</text>
  <text start="400.21" dur="4.2">calling it insane conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="402.19" dur="3.72">and making fun of people but at the end</text>
  <text start="404.41" dur="3.509">of the day it&amp;#39;s absolutely true it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.91" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s absolutely apparent everyone who</text>
  <text start="407.919" dur="3.481">follows Trump is aware of it and maybe</text>
  <text start="409.99" dur="2.91">the people on the left don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="411.4" dur="5.7">it yet because they&amp;#39;re the beneficiaries</text>
  <text start="412.9" dur="6.39">of censorship but it&amp;#39;s absolutely true</text>
  <text start="417.1" dur="3.36">and now to see Trump coming at it so</text>
  <text start="419.29" dur="4.23">hard you know</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="6.15">he never lets us down this is just the</text>
  <text start="423.52" dur="5.13">next will the next step in many steps</text>
  <text start="426.61" dur="6.6">that will be required to rollback the</text>
  <text start="428.65" dur="7.05">censorship and let&amp;#39;s see I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="3.9">it for the things I want to cover just</text>
  <text start="435.7" dur="3.3">me talking let me show you a few things</text>

  <text start="663.37" dur="5.07">Trump is going to do the best he can and</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="6.12">that situation now I also want to</text>

  <text start="701.92" dur="4.22">makes it very clear and even links that</text>
  <text start="703.72" dur="5.46">the articles and the actual law laws</text>
  <text start="706.14" dur="5.89">where what happened here is not an</text>
  <text start="709.18" dur="4.86">in-kind campaign contribution at the end</text>
  <text start="712.03" dur="4.56">of the day stormy Daniels tried to</text>

  <text start="716.59" dur="5.22">Trump didn&amp;#39;t even know about it at the</text>
  <text start="718.45" dur="6.45">time and Cohen decided to just pay it</text>
  <text start="721.81" dur="5.22">off and build Trump and at the end of</text>
  <text start="724.9" dur="5.55">the day this was not an in-kind campaign</text>
  <text start="727.03" dur="5.36">contribution and if it was they would</text>
  <text start="730.45" dur="3.96">have to prove that Trump knew about it</text>
  <text start="732.39" dur="4.48">beforehand and had taught and and</text>
  <text start="734.41" dur="4.41">basically if Cohen had said hey this is</text>
  <text start="736.87" dur="4.5">illegal I can&amp;#39;t do it and then Trump had</text>
  <text start="738.82" dur="5.19">said okay we&amp;#39;ll do it anyway and then he</text>
  <text start="741.37" dur="4.92">had still done it then you could pin it</text>
  <text start="744.01" dur="4.38">on Trump however they don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="746.29" dur="3.96">evidence and even if they did have that</text>
  <text start="748.39" dur="5.22">evidence then it becomes the equivalent</text>
  <text start="750.25" dur="4.35">of a big speeding ticket Obama did it he</text>
  <text start="753.61" dur="2.01">had a four hundred thousand dollar fine</text>
