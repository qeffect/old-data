  <text start="0.35" dur="4.69">survive okay so continuing on we have</text>
  <text start="3.12" dur="5.58">apparently you know according to this</text>
  <text start="5.04" dur="5.22">narrative the the Fallen Angels the</text>
  <text start="8.7" dur="4.41">grigory the watchers of which there were</text>
  <text start="10.26" dur="4.41">five principal leaders not just one so</text>
  <text start="13.11" dur="4.169">there&amp;#39;s no just there&amp;#39;s no particular</text>
  <text start="14.67" dur="6.449">one Satan there was a leader but there</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="8.221">were five really leaders among a group</text>
  <text start="21.119" dur="6.33">of twenty Chiefs who had twenty Myriad&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="25.5" dur="6.09">of Myriad&amp;#39;s or so man he was like two</text>
  <text start="27.449" dur="6.481">million so two million evil angels fell</text>
  <text start="31.59" dur="4.649">to the earth apparently at Antarctica</text>
  <text start="33.93" dur="5.61">which it would explain why the elite are</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="5.241">so hush-hush and cover-up about some of</text>
  <text start="39.54" dur="4.98">the stuff there now this leads into</text>
  <text start="41.48" dur="4.69">alien stuff the hidden space stuff the</text>
  <text start="44.52" dur="4.5">hidden military technology stuff a</text>
  <text start="46.17" dur="7.279">suppressed technology stuff and this is</text>
  <text start="49.02" dur="6.449">kind of where I start to get more</text>
  <text start="53.449" dur="6.581">believing right like I don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="55.469" dur="7.02">believe all of the the the the religious</text>
  <text start="60.03" dur="4.58">stories which may or may not be metaphor</text>
  <text start="62.489" dur="4.861">for what happened right like it may be</text>
  <text start="64.61" dur="4.84">stories passed down over long periods of</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="5.76">time that have sort of been turned into</text>
  <text start="69.45" dur="5.099">these like virtue metaphor stories and</text>
  <text start="73.11" dur="3.24">maybe it was all aliens to begin with</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="3.841">right maybe we really were colonized</text>
  <text start="76.35" dur="5.55">and messed with by other species I mean</text>
  <text start="78.39" dur="5.22">there is that are each of the</text>
  <text start="81.9" dur="4.44">rh-negative or something blood type</text>
  <text start="83.61" dur="4.47">which is kind of genetic proof that were</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="6.029">definitely a hybrid species and we have</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="6.66">not evolved from one species because</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="4.64">those those mother&amp;#39;s human mothers will</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="5.489">reject their own babies if they have</text>
  <text start="97.009" dur="4.691">another type of blood type with the baby</text>
  <text start="100.229" dur="3.39">so they have to actually give these</text>
  <text start="101.7" dur="3.239">women like a special shot so that they</text>
  <text start="103.619" dur="4.351">don&amp;#39;t reject their own babies this is a</text>
  <text start="104.939" dur="7.201">legitimate real this is a problem I</text>
  <text start="107.97" dur="7.17">think it&amp;#39;s Rh negative blood type so so</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="5.97">you have a crash site where these aliens</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="5.909">landed long ago began to mess with</text>
  <text start="118.11" dur="5.67">people eat people breed with people</text>
  <text start="121.049" dur="3.911">tinker with our DNA possibly some people</text>
  <text start="123.78" dur="4.54">think that</text>
  <text start="124.96" dur="4.829">and and basically just caused a lot of</text>
  <text start="128.32" dur="3.96">problems and then apparently they were</text>
  <text start="129.789" dur="7.081">wiped out and flooded possibly by you</text>
  <text start="132.28" dur="6.96">know God or another positive alien force</text>
  <text start="136.87" dur="3.84">or something if you if you listen to the</text>
  <text start="139.24" dur="2.969">people who who actually believe in all</text>
  <text start="140.71" dur="4.02">of the alien stuff and I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="142.209" dur="4.291">they&amp;#39;re crazy but it is difficult right</text>
  <text start="144.73" dur="3.75">it is difficult to believe this stuff</text>
  <text start="146.5" dur="4.76">even when you look into all the evidence</text>
  <text start="148.48" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of convincing stuff but</text>
  <text start="151.26" dur="5.71">when you really start to believe these</text>
  <text start="153.25" dur="5.64">people you know they are suggesting that</text>
  <text start="156.97" dur="3.989">there are many many many times more good</text>
  <text start="158.89" dur="2.25">aliens in space watching things right</text>
  <text start="160.959" dur="4.981">now</text>
  <text start="161.14" dur="9.3">and kind of protecting us from certain</text>
  <text start="165.94" dur="6.18">abuses the idea being that he will have</text>
  <text start="170.44" dur="3.66">to play by the certain rules right they</text>
  <text start="172.12" dur="3.81">have to let us know what&amp;#39;s going on they</text>
  <text start="174.1" dur="3.53">have to reveal their intentions and</text>
  <text start="175.93" dur="4.05">basically get permission otherwise</text>
  <text start="177.63" dur="5.8">according to the law of one and then and</text>
  <text start="179.98" dur="5.1">and all of the the cosmic rules right</text>
  <text start="183.43" dur="3.57">they develop bad karma so they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="185.08" dur="5.4">want that so they have to get permission</text>
  <text start="187" dur="5.13">to to enslave us and then of course give</text>
  <text start="190.48" dur="2.97">us all of those little hints like in the</text>
  <text start="192.13" dur="3.93">movies and stuff about what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="193.45" dur="5.91">planning to do to us or what their real</text>
  <text start="196.06" dur="6.17">beliefs are things like that this would</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="5.82">this would explain that sort of weird</text>
  <text start="202.23" dur="5.59">morality that the elite evil guys have</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="6.059">that they do sort of want to tell on</text>
  <text start="207.82" dur="4.83">themselves sometimes you know you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="2.97">have to believe in aliens to necessarily</text>
  <text start="212.65" dur="4.2">think that that rule is a hard and fast</text>
  <text start="214.209" dur="5.941">rule for daily what they have to respect</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="5.69">freewill many people believe that that</text>
  <text start="220.15" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t believe in aliens because if just</text>
  <text start="222.54" dur="5.89">experience and in history with them you</text>
  <text start="225.7" dur="4.59">know we&amp;#39;re dealing with you eat so it is</text>
  <text start="228.43" dur="3.57">interesting I&amp;#39;m not saying I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="3.39">supporting one or the other I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="232" dur="4.13">letting you know guys that this kind of</text>
  <text start="233.68" dur="5.79">narrative is out there this kind of</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="5.29">story is out there and it has as much</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="4.48">convincing evidence as anything else so</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="4.87">it is interesting</text>
  <text start="243.95" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s interesting to see more of the</text>
  <text start="246.29" dur="5.39">story of the Fallen Angels the grigory</text>
  <text start="248.03" dur="5.789">the watchers what happened to them</text>
  <text start="251.68" dur="3.76">Noah&amp;#39;s granddad</text>
  <text start="253.819" dur="3.241">Enoch apparently gets to go to heaven</text>
  <text start="255.44" dur="3.44">sees all kinds of cool stuff so he gives</text>
  <text start="257.06" dur="4.109">you like a tour</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="4.72">he&amp;#39;s like talks to God himself is pretty</text>
  <text start="261.169" dur="3.631">interesting passage but this book was</text>
  <text start="263.6" dur="3.06">left out of the Bible</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="3.54">some say intentionally because you know</text>
  <text start="266.66" dur="6.53">Illuminati don&amp;#39;t want you to know the</text>
  <text start="268.34" dur="9.03">full truth but you know it does sort of</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="7.66">reveal what they believe there has to be</text>
  <text start="277.37" dur="5.609">and think about it if you were you know</text>
  <text start="280.85" dur="6.78">the descendant of some sort of you know</text>
  <text start="282.979" dur="6.991">powerful godlike being you know and you</text>
  <text start="287.63" dur="3.27">basically part of this cult from birth</text>
  <text start="289.97" dur="2.13">where you think you&amp;#39;re better than</text>
  <text start="290.9" dur="3.9">everyone else and you&amp;#39;re part of another</text>
  <text start="292.1" dur="4.68">species humans like killed your</text>
  <text start="294.8" dur="4.32">ancestors and Lane you&amp;#39;re trapped on</text>
  <text start="296.78" dur="3.389">earth and there are probably something</text>
  <text start="299.12" dur="3.51">up there that don&amp;#39;t want you to get off</text>
  <text start="300.169" dur="5.431">the planet good guys so I mean these</text>
  <text start="302.63" dur="6.39">guys are pissed off and evil and then</text>
  <text start="305.6" dur="8.31">they want revenge and then they enjoy</text>
  <text start="309.02" dur="11.88">things like sex obviously angels dead</text>
  <text start="313.91" dur="9.09">with women what is it and of course they</text>
  <text start="320.9" dur="5.639">enjoy the Penta for stuff the the</text>
  <text start="323" dur="5.37">killing and torture and eating of the</text>
  <text start="326.539" dur="5.971">flesh and the drinking of the blood and</text>
  <text start="328.37" dur="6.33">of course the dream so maybe maybe what</text>
  <text start="332.51" dur="5.73">really happened is some of the the bad</text>
  <text start="334.7" dur="4.68">angels came down here got jiggy with the</text>
  <text start="338.24" dur="3.989">women which they weren&amp;#39;t supposed to do</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="5.52">it corrupted their purpose God cast him</text>
  <text start="342.229" dur="4.021">out trapped them on the planet basically</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="3.45">found them there forever they could Gori</text>
  <text start="346.25" dur="4.14">themselves the actual angels like what</text>
  <text start="348.35" dur="5.129">you would consider Lucifer and his</text>
  <text start="350.39" dur="5.07">cohorts are apparently trapped under the</text>
  <text start="353.479" dur="3.361">ground you know with sharp rocks and</text>
  <text start="355.46" dur="3.78">dirt olive oil so they&amp;#39;re basically like</text>
  <text start="356.84" dur="6.57">buried alive until the end of time they</text>
  <text start="359.24" dur="5.61">cannot escape and they cannot die but</text>
  <text start="363.41" dur="2.91">theoretically that means that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="364.85" dur="3.06">actually underground right like this</text>
  <text start="366.32" dur="2.849">kind of goes and all that other Agartha</text>
  <text start="367.91" dur="3.65">stuff where there&amp;#39;s like an underground</text>
  <text start="369.169" dur="4.981">civilization and all linked together so</text>
  <text start="371.56" dur="4.03">it&amp;#39;s interesting we know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.15" dur="2.49">stuff going on with the secret space</text>
  <text start="375.59" dur="1.65">program we know that there&amp;#39;s stuff</text>
  <text start="376.64" dur="2.339">they&amp;#39;re not telling</text>
  <text start="377.24" dur="2.94">with Antarctica these ancient</text>
  <text start="378.979" dur="3.171">civilizations that were doing things</text>
  <text start="380.18" dur="3.78">that they could not possibly have done</text>
  <text start="382.15" dur="3.639">popping up out of nowhere with</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="3.69">technology that we cannot even replicate</text>
  <text start="385.789" dur="4.021">today like these pyramids and stuff</text>
  <text start="387.65" dur="4.799">the Japanese tried to do like a</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="4.829">scaled-down replica and the Japanese are</text>
  <text start="392.449" dur="5.761">very very smart and they could not build</text>
  <text start="394.639" dur="8.221">a pyramid okay so something is up in our</text>
  <text start="398.21" dur="7.59">history that we have been intentionally</text>
  <text start="402.86" dur="4.589">led away from all right and you have to</text>
  <text start="405.8" dur="3.179">sort of go through some of the stories</text>
  <text start="407.449" dur="3.301">to kind of reclaim some of that</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="4.111">narrative whether you believe it or not</text>
  <text start="410.75" dur="4.5">I just thought this was fascinating it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="413.09" dur="4.199">morning you know I can&amp;#39;t really research</text>
  <text start="415.25" dur="5.22">the news because it&amp;#39;s 9:20 a.m. there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.289" dur="4.38">nothing that&amp;#39;s happened yet but you know</text>
  <text start="420.47" dur="2.91">in the mornings I do some of the other</text>
  <text start="421.669" dur="3.03">stuff I look up some of the other stuff</text>
  <text start="423.38" dur="5.129">but I like to look into and sometimes</text>
  <text start="424.699" dur="6">honestly yes I will get on a rabbit hole</text>
  <text start="428.509" dur="6.03">and this rabbit hole has been pretty</text>
  <text start="430.699" dur="6.72">good David Wilcock you know from an ass</text>
  <text start="434.539" dur="5.821">at an agnostic perspective this is a</text>
  <text start="437.419" dur="5.911">fascinating like a retelling or left out</text>
  <text start="440.36" dur="5.88">book from the Bible that just really</text>
  <text start="443.33" dur="5.73">adds in like so much more especially if</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;re like me and you&amp;#39;re like whole</text>
  <text start="449.06" dur="4.949">purpose in life basically is to fight</text>
  <text start="451.13" dur="4.05">the elite you know like I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="454.009" dur="4.53">inside their heads a little bit it feels</text>
  <text start="455.18" dur="4.59">like I don&amp;#39;t know anyway this is just a</text>
