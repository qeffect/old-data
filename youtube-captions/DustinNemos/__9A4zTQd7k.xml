  <text start="141.51" dur="4.44">things are really getting there just as</text>
  <text start="143.7" dur="3.92">I&amp;#39;ve been saying for the last year</text>
  <text start="145.95" dur="4.89">basically since I started youtubing</text>
  <text start="147.62" dur="5.02">Christmas Eve 2017 I&amp;#39;ve been saying</text>
  <text start="150.84" dur="3.33">these things I&amp;#39;ve been saying right</text>
  <text start="152.64" dur="3.9">along with what Q has been saying</text>
  <text start="154.17" dur="4.2">because we tweet we have the plan we</text>
  <text start="156.54" dur="5.55">just follow the plan and that&amp;#39;s it and</text>
  <text start="158.37" dur="5.01">he keeps proving it to us so you know</text>
  <text start="162.09" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re getting right up to the midterms</text>

  <text start="173.3" dur="5.17">Republican red wave to happen and even</text>
  <text start="176.43" dur="4.5">beyond that Trump is actually gaining in</text>
  <text start="178.47" dur="3.96">the polls was usually presidents about</text>
  <text start="180.93" dur="2.82">this time we&amp;#39;re losing in the polls and</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="4.14">Trump is still four points higher at</text>
  <text start="183.75" dur="6.51">least than Obama I have no idea who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="186.57" dur="6.54">messaging me but anyway we also have</text>
  <text start="190.26" dur="6.24">Dems are introducing a bill to block the</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="5.46">release of 3d printed gun blueprints now</text>
  <text start="196.5" dur="5.46">remember I recently came to you guys and</text>
  <text start="198.57" dur="5.61">I talked to you about mean meat that I</text>
  <text start="201.96" dur="4.56">talked to you about 3d printing</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="3.63">technology and how it&amp;#39;s about to hit and</text>
  <text start="206.52" dur="2.64">actually I think it&amp;#39;s midnight tonight</text>
  <text start="207.81" dur="4.65">or something they&amp;#39;re gonna release a lot</text>
  <text start="209.16" dur="5.43">of these blueprints okay this is an</text>
  <text start="212.46" dur="3.69">exciting exciting technology I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.59" dur="4.08">been around for a while but this is like</text>
  <text start="216.15" dur="4.29">taking it convenient right this is like</text>
  <text start="218.67" dur="5.16">making it user-friendly this is making</text>
  <text start="220.44" dur="6">it Ford customer thinking like you know</text>
  <text start="223.83" dur="5.34">end-result retail level if I don&amp;#39;t spill</text>
  <text start="226.44" dur="4.68">my mighty there and this is gonna change</text>
  <text start="229.17" dur="3.24">the world I mean obviously gun gun</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="3.839">control doesn&amp;#39;t work but now it really</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="4.89">won&amp;#39;t work okay this is gonna open it up</text>
  <text start="234.959" dur="5.341">just to four gangs and everything else</text>
  <text start="237.3" dur="4.65">but it&amp;#39;ll also make it far more obvious</text>
  <text start="240.3" dur="3.659">that every single person needs to be</text>
  <text start="241.95" dur="4.02">armed so in the end I think is gonna be</text>
  <text start="243.959" dur="3.781">a good thing although I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="245.97" dur="3.81">gonna have some story about some gang</text>
  <text start="247.74" dur="6.63">using it to make a billion weapons and</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="7.709">attack somebody but okay the point of</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="5.64">all of these anti-gun pro-gun arguments</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="5.221">is not that we can ever get rid of guns</text>
  <text start="260.01" dur="5.7">because that&amp;#39;s not possible and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="5.19">that the the bad guys are going to stop</text>
  <text start="265.71" dur="6.239">using them it&amp;#39;s that we have to</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="6.57">meet evil with you know proportional</text>
  <text start="271.949" dur="4.891">force we have to we have to meet evil</text>
  <text start="274.47" dur="4.4">especially evil violence with violence</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="5.73">we have to we have to defend ourselves</text>
  <text start="278.87" dur="5.049">go figure right and you know if all the</text>
  <text start="282.57" dur="2.52">bad guys in the world had a gun and all</text>
  <text start="283.919" dur="2.461">the good guys in the world had a gun</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="3">because they saw the bad guys in the</text>
  <text start="286.38" dur="3.72">world having guns that no one can get</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="4.29">rid of you see where I&amp;#39;m going with this</text>
  <text start="290.1" dur="4.11">the bad guys would be gone overnight the</text>
  <text start="292.38" dur="3.18">good guys would therefore have learned</text>
  <text start="294.21" dur="3.51">the very important lesson that our</text>
  <text start="295.56" dur="3.57">forefathers learned or at least those of</text>
  <text start="297.72" dur="4.08">us who you know had forefathers in the</text>
  <text start="299.13" dur="4.38">Revolutionary War and that that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="301.8" dur="4.47">exciting because you know even if bad</text>
  <text start="303.51" dur="4.29">guys do use these weapons and crimes and</text>
  <text start="306.27" dur="4.23">they probably will I mean let&amp;#39;s be</text>
  <text start="307.8" dur="5.399">honest it&amp;#39;s going to wake more people up</text>
  <text start="310.5" dur="4.38">to the reality of the situation so this</text>
  <text start="313.199" dur="3.69">is very very very exciting but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="314.88" dur="3.72">trying to block it of course now I have</text>
  <text start="316.889" dur="3.181">reached out to them and I&amp;#39;ve told them</text>

  <text start="344.82" dur="4.77">facing now I mean double jeopardy or not</text>
  <text start="347.19" dur="4.32">I guess and rod Rosenstein was the</text>

  <text start="370.53" dur="5.4">you know crooked as hell and he probably</text>
  <text start="373.38" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t think of this too hard a lot of</text>
  <text start="375.93" dur="3.18">this seems like they were just throwing</text>
  <text start="377.28" dur="3.389">stuff together and just kind of reacting</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="3.929">to Q which is what Q had told us he did</text>
  <text start="380.669" dur="4.711">in the first place you know he he often</text>
  <text start="383.039" dur="4.831">puts out disinfo or he&amp;#39;ll often go one</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="4.92">way just to make them panic and freak</text>
  <text start="387.87" dur="4.26">out and then react and let loose their</text>
  <text start="390.3" dur="4.799">plans or make a mistake or act too soon</text>
  <text start="392.13" dur="6.029">or react and just like trump he sets the</text>
  <text start="395.099" dur="5.07">pace okay now in the corruption world we</text>

  <text start="518.039" dur="3.661">of course it makes sense it&amp;#39;s just a PR</text>
  <text start="519.87" dur="3.27">move to convince everyone else on their</text>
  <text start="521.7" dur="2.7">side that they&amp;#39;re actually being honest</text>

  <text start="658.129" dur="4.14">the reality of this man he was calling</text>
  <text start="660.379" dur="3">from the motorcade and he wanted to make</text>
  <text start="662.269" dur="2.76">sure I had a good time</text>
  <text start="663.379" dur="4.551">and he thanked me for bringing my</text>

  <text start="669.64" dur="3.36">something else that truly blew my mind</text>
  <text start="671.26" dur="4.26">and hopefully I can tell you more about</text>
  <text start="673" dur="3.57">that in days to come for now I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="675.52" dur="3.39">to keep the rest of our conversation</text>
  <text start="676.57" dur="4.11">private because not everyone who reads</text>
  <text start="678.91" dur="4.26">this will have pure motive obviously and</text>
  <text start="680.68" dur="4.14">it isn&amp;#39;t my point anyway I want you to</text>
  <text start="683.17" dur="4.05">understand how truly kind and humble</text>
  <text start="684.82" dur="4.68">this president actually is how he takes</text>
  <text start="687.22" dur="5.91">time to reach out to make sure people</text>
  <text start="689.5" dur="5.91">feel appreciated Who am I nobody even my</text>
  <text start="693.13" dur="4.05">daughter said why mama I don&amp;#39;t get why</text>
  <text start="695.41" dur="6.36">he is so good to everyone when people</text>
  <text start="697.18" dur="7.08">are so awful to him yes I talked for him</text>
  <text start="701.77" dur="3.99">on TV but so do a hundred other people</text>
  <text start="704.26" dur="3.75">in the reality is that if I were gone</text>
  <text start="705.76" dur="3.75">tomorrow he would be just fine he has no</text>
  <text start="708.01" dur="4.8">reason to take the time he does to bless</text>
  <text start="709.51" dur="5.01">me but he does that&amp;#39;s who he is I want</text>
  <text start="712.81" dur="4.14">you to know this in case you ever doubt</text>
  <text start="714.52" dur="3.78">his heart life can be discouraging but</text>
  <text start="716.95" dur="3.12">when it gets that way for you and you</text>
  <text start="718.3" dur="3.599">stop to wonder why what you are fighting</text>
  <text start="720.07" dur="3.93">for I want you to be able to remember</text>
  <text start="721.899" dur="4.201">this story and know that this president</text>
  <text start="724" dur="4.14">this is the president you worked so hard</text>
  <text start="726.1" dur="3.66">to elect this is the kind of person you</text>
  <text start="728.14" dur="3.33">work to keep in the Oval Office this</text>
  <text start="729.76" dur="4.199">leader is worth fighting for because he</text>
  <text start="731.47" dur="4.86">doesn&amp;#39;t forget the little guy or girl</text>
  <text start="733.959" dur="4.411">in so many ways this president this</text>
  <text start="736.33" dur="4.68">person has renewed my faith in humanity</text>
  <text start="738.37" dur="6.3">he isn&amp;#39;t perfect and I only worship</text>
  <text start="741.01" dur="5.31">Jesus not any man but djt is a human who</text>
  <text start="744.67" dur="3.419">has managed to grab on to the blessings</text>
  <text start="746.32" dur="3.959">God gave him and to love people with</text>
  <text start="748.089" dur="4.861">those gifts his sacrifice is real and</text>
  <text start="750.279" dur="4.741">his burden has to be heavy but he was</text>
  <text start="752.95" dur="4.41">born for this and has so much joy in the</text>
  <text start="755.02" dur="4.05">journey that empowers him to seem almost</text>
  <text start="757.36" dur="4.71">superhuman because God has appointed him</text>
  <text start="759.07" dur="4.86">for such a time as this no doubt that</text>
  <text start="762.07" dur="3.3">reality is very stark to me today as I</text>
  <text start="763.93" dur="3.599">fight sleep because of the eight-hour</text>
  <text start="765.37" dur="4.89">round trip to get back in time to go on</text>
  <text start="767.529" dur="4.171">air for most of the rest of today how</text>
  <text start="770.26" dur="4.019">does he do this his energy is</text>
  <text start="771.7" dur="4.53">astonishing he does it for you his plan</text>
  <text start="774.279" dur="3.991">was to retire to Scotland to golf and to</text>
  <text start="776.23" dur="4.77">enjoy the fruits of a lifetime of work</text>
  <text start="778.27" dur="4.86">with his grandchildren he chose to serve</text>
  <text start="781" dur="4.56">the country he loves in you and our</text>
  <text start="783.13" dur="4.59">children instead no question about his</text>
  <text start="785.56" dur="4.71">sacrifice but he never complains and</text>
  <text start="787.72" dur="5.34">likely he didn&amp;#39;t even know that was his</text>
  <text start="790.27" dur="4.35">plan even if you never get to meet him</text>
  <text start="793.06" dur="3.33">in person and I hope you do he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="794.62" dur="3.81">shockingly real and down-to-earth and</text>
  <text start="796.39" dur="3.51">yet bigger than life you can at least</text>
  <text start="798.43" dur="2.2">have the assurance that he really is</text>
  <text start="799.9" dur="2.65">that person</text>
  <text start="800.63" dur="4.8">takes time to acknowledge and appreciate</text>
  <text start="802.55" dur="6.839">and honor those who try to defend him</text>
  <text start="805.43" dur="5.849">every day that&amp;#39;s you okay so this this</text>
  <text start="809.389" dur="4.26">is actually a public figure so Gina</text>

  <text start="819.319" dur="2.911">that&amp;#39;s a hell of a story I mean we</text>
  <text start="820.67" dur="2.82">already kind of knew that about him if</text>
  <text start="822.23" dur="2.609">we&amp;#39;ve really been paying attention but</text>

  <text start="831.319" dur="4.731">kind of make that an aware for everyone</text>
  <text start="833.569" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s a story that needs to be told now</text>
  <text start="836.05" dur="2.92">before we get into the queue post over</text>
  <text start="838.279" dur="3.391">the last two days</text>
  <text start="838.97" dur="3.9">Sarah Sanders was actually kind of asked</text>
  <text start="841.67" dur="4.05">about queue in a White House press</text>
  <text start="842.87" dur="5.399">briefing but not really here&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="4.289">really went down okay the MSM said does</text>
  <text start="848.269" dur="4.111">the president support fringe groups like</text>
  <text start="850.009" dur="4.58">Q none or any that promote violence okay</text>
  <text start="852.38" dur="5.93">look at the the framing of that like Oh</text>
  <text start="854.589" dur="5.8">like why do you why do you hate women or</text>
  <text start="858.31" dur="3.31">why do you think rape is okay I mean</text>
  <text start="860.389" dur="3.781">that&amp;#39;s the kind of framing that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="861.62" dur="3.719">dealing with like Q and violence like Q</text>
  <text start="864.17" dur="3.93">promote violence that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="865.339" dur="4.11">trying to say or any other groups they</text>
  <text start="868.1" dur="2.729">might as well have said any other group</text>
  <text start="869.449" dur="4.26">that promotes violence image really</text>
  <text start="870.829" dur="4.38">obvious and she says in response the</text>
  <text start="873.709" dur="3.75">president does not support violence by</text>
  <text start="875.209" dur="4.081">any group upon another so this is you</text>

  <text start="882.259" dur="4.531">there&amp;#39;s any spark but this was not a</text>
  <text start="884.54" dur="4.89">question about Q and on this was like a</text>

  <text start="889.43" dur="3.54">you and on to violence which if you if</text>
  <text start="891.47" dur="2.91">you look up the recent articles I mean</text>
  <text start="892.97" dur="3.929">there&amp;#39;s a ton of articles coming out</text>

  <text start="925.279" dur="3.12">all the other things that it came out</text>
  <text start="926.81" dur="3.899">and proved to us and showed us but</text>
  <text start="928.399" dur="3.961">basically like like the basically the</text>
  <text start="930.709" dur="2.99">CIA was letting viruses run everywhere</text>
  <text start="932.36" dur="3.649">just so they could use them to get into</text>

  <text start="936.009" dur="3">there anything but there&amp;#39;s a lot of bad</text>
  <text start="937.179" dur="3.51">stuff in there however one of the</text>
  <text start="939.009" dur="3.45">biggies is that they clearly and</text>
  <text start="940.689" dur="4.14">obviously improve ibly have the ability</text>
  <text start="942.459" dur="3.78">to pretend they&amp;#39;re Russians when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="944.829" dur="3.69">hacking something okay and just set it</text>

  <text start="948.519" dur="3.3">to do this it&amp;#39;s really not that</text>
  <text start="949.72" dur="4.829">complicated it would be kind of the</text>
  <text start="951.819" dur="6.42">equivalent in virtual terms of writing a</text>
  <text start="954.549" dur="5.97">return address on a envelope with your</text>

  <text start="960.519" dur="3.66">and a Russian name and then like framing</text>
  <text start="962.679" dur="5.07">that particular Russian with that</text>
  <text start="964.179" dur="5.16">address and name for this like bombed</text>
  <text start="967.749" dur="4.95">bomb in a package or something like</text>
  <text start="969.339" dur="6.391">really obvious if you were to send a</text>

  <text start="975.73" dur="3.389">after the guy who like supposedly sent</text>
  <text start="977.589" dur="3.75">it hopefully they would have the</text>
  <text start="979.119" dur="3.72">intelligence enough to know that no one</text>
  <text start="981.339" dur="3.27">would just send a bomb and put the real</text>
  <text start="982.839" dur="6.12">address on it okay that&amp;#39;s exactly the</text>
  <text start="984.609" dur="6.27">kind of equivalency that vol 7 is in the</text>
  <text start="988.959" dur="3.78">virtual world they you know among other</text>
  <text start="990.879" dur="4.5">things like I said they can just make it</text>
  <text start="992.739" dur="4.95">look they can spoof it to look like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="995.379" dur="4.79">Russian okay and that should concern</text>
