  <text start="216.4" dur="6.119">oh well Victor so Victor says can you</text>
  <text start="221.26" dur="3.29">talk about how you see the Great</text>
  <text start="222.519" dur="4.561">Awakening panning out like a long view</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="4.35">when everyone actually realizes the evil</text>
  <text start="227.08" dur="4.95">that has been controlling us for so long</text>
  <text start="228.9" dur="6.16">it&amp;#39;s not a not a hard question at all</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="5.55">okay so the short version basically I</text>
  <text start="235.06" dur="4.679">think that as we build new systems and</text>
  <text start="237.58" dur="3.989">as people get just get more and more</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="3.181">disgusted with the old systems there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.569" dur="4.411">gonna be more and more of a flippin</text>
  <text start="242.92" dur="6.27">point like they talk about that like the</text>
  <text start="245.98" dur="6.18">polar caps switching or wouldn&amp;#39;t polar</text>
  <text start="249.19" dur="5.43">caps the the magnetic caps of the planet</text>
  <text start="252.16" dur="4.68">switching to suddenly switch we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="4.859">have that in in a political sense a</text>
  <text start="256.84" dur="5.22">cultural sense and at that point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="259.479" dur="5.16">just going to be that like Magga</text>
  <text start="262.06" dur="5.91">businesses thrive there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="264.639" dur="5.181">kind of a new resurgence a new era of</text>
  <text start="267.97" dur="4.38">hope and prosperity and all that such</text>
  <text start="269.82" dur="4.06">there is gonna be some economic hardship</text>
  <text start="272.35" dur="4.74">that we have to struggle with because of</text>
  <text start="273.88" dur="6.38">the coming collapse I think but I just</text>
  <text start="277.09" dur="5.49">see a lot of good stuff coming ahead I</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="3.7">you know I don&amp;#39;t see it as too much I</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="3.059">think there&amp;#39;s gonna be obviously some</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="4.26">some painful lessons to be learned for</text>
  <text start="285.639" dur="6.53">people but it&amp;#39;s just to me growing pains</text>
  <text start="288.22" dur="6.449">at this point of course we&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="292.169" dur="3.641">more and more resistance until it they</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="2.93">just don&amp;#39;t have the power to resist</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="4.37">anymore</text>
  <text start="297.599" dur="11.681">they&amp;#39;re resisting themselves into a</text>
  <text start="300.18" dur="10.51">regional party right now caffeine addict</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="3.12">has a good question I don&amp;#39;t think so</text>
  <text start="310.69" dur="4.53">Toro is that bright so I would have to</text>
  <text start="312.4" dur="5.639">probably hazard the guess that the</text>
  <text start="315.22" dur="7.83">bushes were more evil cuz really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.039" dur="6.661">about I whose masterminding it I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="5.6">know who did more damage so that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.7" dur="6.99">another way of met maybe Metra King that</text>
  <text start="328.65" dur="4.69">yeah even Brett makes a good point Gould</text>
  <text start="331.69" dur="4.08">as everybody&amp;#39;s acquiring gold all the</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="4.259">all the central banks requiring it on</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="5.3">the DL and of course even Q has</text>
  <text start="337.599" dur="3.471">mentioned that gold will break the Fed</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m already planning to build the next</text>
  <text start="351.18" dur="4.11">system to replace like Amazon and all</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="6.12">these other equal companies that are</text>
  <text start="355.29" dur="7.17">censoring people I&amp;#39;m planning a internet</text>
  <text start="359.1" dur="4.65">wide campaign against censorship I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="362.46" dur="3.27">already kind of hinted at it with the</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="4.11">video I did and then I&amp;#39;ve kind of hinted</text>
  <text start="365.73" dur="4.68">at it on Twitter but I&amp;#39;m building</text>
  <text start="367.86" dur="4.32">something a coalition sort of a knights</text>
  <text start="370.41" dur="4.98">of the round table get together of all</text>
  <text start="372.18" dur="4.68">of the alt media and when I&amp;#39;m ready I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="375.39" dur="4.71">gonna go big with that and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="4.65">find the best attorney possible and</text>
  <text start="380.1" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re gonna go to them with it with a</text>
  <text start="381.51" dur="4.47">movement of millions and we&amp;#39;re gonna say</text>
  <text start="383.88" dur="4.77">look the movement is here we have the</text>
  <text start="385.98" dur="5.01">the public pressure and support we have</text>
  <text start="388.65" dur="4.29">the spotlight and we have the president</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="3.99">talking about censorship we have</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="3.57">everybody talking about censorship and</text>
  <text start="394.98" dur="3.96">we have it being such a blatant and</text>
  <text start="396.51" dur="4.53">obvious problem we have all of these</text>
  <text start="398.94" dur="6.54">other precedents where good guys are</text>
  <text start="401.04" dur="8.25">beating evil in big ways I think we</text>
  <text start="405.48" dur="8.93">should be able to bring on a big trial</text>
  <text start="409.29" dur="5.12">attorney at that point easily</text>
  <text start="417.33" dur="6.26">I&amp;#39;m tired of waiting around for</text>
  <text start="420.24" dur="3.35">something to be done about censorship</text>
  <text start="438.229" dur="4.49">I would not be surprised Candace if</text>
  <text start="440.18" dur="2.539">that&amp;#39;s the case</text>
  <text start="444.789" dur="3.6">speaking of Rothschild have we heard</text>
  <text start="447.009" dur="4.291">anything else about the one that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="448.389" dur="4.89">after me I I honestly haven&amp;#39;t had a</text>
  <text start="451.3" dur="2.539">chance to dig too hard into what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="453.279" dur="3.151">saying</text>
  <text start="453.839" dur="5.04">if anybody&amp;#39;s keeping up with that let me</text>
  <text start="456.43" dur="2.449">know please</text>
  <text start="459.27" dur="6.069">Brett Collins you said by palladium now</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="3.91">did I wish I heard that all of the</text>
  <text start="465.339" dur="3.54">palladium in the whole world could fit</text>
  <text start="466.87" dur="6.75">in one bedroom like compare that to gold</text>
  <text start="468.879" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s way more scarce and precious it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="473.62" dur="2.969">about the same price I think is gold</text>
  <text start="474.999" dur="3.831">right I don&amp;#39;t usually ask for the</text>
  <text start="476.589" dur="2.241">Palladium</text>
  <text start="490.76" dur="6.42">Cass means I think it&amp;#39;s an incentive</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="7.41">structure issue when you have a the</text>
  <text start="497.18" dur="5.7">problem with in the past when you try a</text>
  <text start="500.48" dur="4.14">capitalism government interference</text>
  <text start="502.88" dur="3.54">always in today it always ended up being</text>
  <text start="504.62" dur="4.11">more of a fascist or collectivist</text>
  <text start="506.42" dur="4.68">problem and then you have corruption and</text>
  <text start="508.73" dur="3.99">monopolization through big flake for</text>
  <text start="511.1" dur="4.89">right now business buying power with</text>
  <text start="512.72" dur="5.88">government capitalism itself</text>
  <text start="515.99" dur="4.89">incentivizes altruism so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="518.6" dur="4.62">trying to create an incentive structure</text>
  <text start="520.88" dur="5.25">to promote altruism you have to get rid</text>
  <text start="523.22" dur="6.62">of government otherwise capitalism can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="526.13" dur="6.69">do its magic and that is turn greed into</text>
  <text start="529.84" dur="4.57">incentivized altruism and that is the</text>
  <text start="532.82" dur="3.78">secret of all secrets right there I</text>
  <text start="534.41" dur="4.56">think as far as I can tell at least it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="536.6" dur="4.71">that government itself is the greatest</text>
  <text start="538.97" dur="3.99">evil on the planet and it is it has</text>
  <text start="541.31" dur="5.04">convinced everyone that it&amp;#39;s necessary</text>
  <text start="542.96" dur="7.38">and that it&amp;#39;s even a necessary good if</text>
  <text start="546.35" dur="7.71">not a necessary evil it is my birthday</text>

  <text start="739.38" dur="6.08">supernatural awakening I miss that big</text>
  <text start="741.36" dur="6.36">orange blob somehow Kryon has channeled</text>
  <text start="745.46" dur="5.08">excuse me cryin has channeled how the</text>
  <text start="747.72" dur="5.01">evil is floundering and we&amp;#39;ll keep doing</text>
  <text start="750.54" dur="3.66">what they are doing and what they are</text>
  <text start="752.73" dur="4.74">and that they are stupid</text>
  <text start="754.2" dur="4.61">I thought of Q and Q plus when I heard</text>

  <text start="758.81" dur="10.39">what is Kryon and what do you mean the</text>
  <text start="766.5" dur="4.59">spiritual or supernatural awakening you</text>
  <text start="769.2" dur="4.83">have to elaborate more for me on those</text>
  <text start="771.09" dur="5.16">points because I would say that a lot of</text>
  <text start="774.03" dur="4.11">the evil in the world like we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="776.25" dur="3.54">for left versus right more like good</text>
  <text start="778.14" dur="5.67">versus evil and that has certainly had a</text>
  <text start="779.79" dur="5.76">spiritual connotation to it you know</text>
  <text start="783.81" dur="3.45">certainly for me and then for others</text>
  <text start="785.55" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;ve always been somewhat spiritual but</text>
  <text start="787.26" dur="5.28">I mean for me this has become like jihad</text>
  <text start="790.41" dur="4.02">like not in a violent way but like this</text>

  <text start="3201.41" dur="4.05">into this pattern where you know maybe</text>
  <text start="3203.9" dur="3.39">he had done some good work and then he</text>
  <text start="3205.46" dur="4.32">got sort of negative and was focused</text>
  <text start="3207.29" dur="4.29">more on on basically like smoking pot</text>
  <text start="3209.78" dur="3.24">and talking about how rich he was with a</text>
  <text start="3211.58" dur="3.21">theory I mean I&amp;#39;m not joking this is</text>

  <text start="3232.43" dur="4.47">at his business he quit doing it I think</text>
  <text start="3234.43" dur="5.05">or he quit for a while and then maybe</text>
  <text start="3236.9" dur="4.11">started back or something but he just</text>
  <text start="3239.48" dur="4.95">said nobody wanted to sign up for his</text>

  <text start="3246.14" dur="4.31">like I&amp;#39;m bigger than he is now like I</text>
  <text start="3248.21" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t understand how that&amp;#39;s possible but</text>
  <text start="3250.45" dur="4.03">like I&amp;#39;m and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a way he&amp;#39;s</text>
