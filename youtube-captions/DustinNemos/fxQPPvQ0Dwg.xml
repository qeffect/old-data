  <text start="5.79" dur="3.929">pleasure to still be with you until we</text>
  <text start="7.77" dur="4.86">get banned at least or something worse</text>
  <text start="9.719" dur="4.561">who knows these days you never know what</text>
  <text start="12.63" dur="3.989">what&amp;#39;s gonna come and I&amp;#39;m always very</text>
  <text start="14.28" dur="4.65">grateful for another day and I</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="3.99">appreciate my sponsors and I appreciate</text>
  <text start="18.93" dur="3.54">my audience I appreciate the folks who</text>
  <text start="20.609" dur="4.561">put me here who have given me this</text>
  <text start="22.47" dur="4.799">platform and this flashlight and I love</text>
  <text start="25.17" dur="4.38">this flashlight folks because it lets me</text>
  <text start="27.269" dur="4.141">expose evil and I really appreciate that</text>
  <text start="29.55" dur="4.23">so it&amp;#39;s for me it&amp;#39;s like a kid in a</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="4.82">playground I really do enjoy my work</text>
  <text start="33.78" dur="6.209">that&amp;#39;s why I do it 18 hours in pain</text>
  <text start="36.23" dur="5.259">anyway continuing on there&amp;#39;s some big</text>
  <text start="39.989" dur="3.301">stuff to talk about there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="4.171">actually a couple of major things that</text>
  <text start="43.29" dur="7.769">will probably affect your life so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="7.41">begin now this is a minor compared to</text>
  <text start="51.059" dur="4.561">the other but this is still a big deal</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="4.789">especially concerning the patriot</text>
  <text start="55.62" dur="5.009">movement itself and let me explain</text>
  <text start="57.859" dur="4.421">because as you know I&amp;#39;ve had my own plan</text>
  <text start="60.629" dur="3.241">for quite some time I&amp;#39;ve been networking</text>
  <text start="62.28" dur="3.379">have been making things happen rather</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="6.179">than waiting on things to happen and</text>
  <text start="65.659" dur="5.921">this is perfect okay because Amazon is</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="3.631">gonna start to kick off many of their</text>
  <text start="71.58" dur="3.899">small suppliers and remember if you get</text>
  <text start="73.68" dur="3.15">very successful they&amp;#39;ll just kick you</text>
  <text start="75.479" dur="3.96">off anyway and start selling your</text>
  <text start="76.83" dur="4.62">product so Amazon is a really dishonest</text>
  <text start="79.439" dur="5.161">company you don&amp;#39;t want to necessarily be</text>
  <text start="81.45" dur="9.12">doing successful large niche business on</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="9.54">there now that aside what I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="90.57" dur="4.799">with this new Magga online mall concept</text>
  <text start="94.14" dur="3.9">which I&amp;#39;m not gonna tell you the name</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="4.981">just yet but it&amp;#39;s pretty darn awesome is</text>
  <text start="98.04" dur="4.98">create a marketplace similar to Amazon</text>
  <text start="100.35" dur="4.53">with or an eBay or something where many</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="5.279">different Patriot businesses can ply</text>
  <text start="104.88" dur="6.84">their wares and it will be sort of a</text>
  <text start="108.299" dur="7.021">patriot amazon and a any of the folks</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="5.009">who are affected by this purge hey I</text>
  <text start="115.32" dur="3.479">know what it feels like to be purged</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="3.74">I&amp;#39;ve been purged too numerous times now</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="4.741">from multiple social media sites</text>
  <text start="120.469" dur="4.51">basically for telling the truth but if</text>

  <text start="252.61" dur="2.61">know how to make it I think you boil off</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="3.87">the fat first then you do these things</text>
  <text start="255.22" dur="3.93">and then you ain&amp;#39;t add the fat and the</text>
  <text start="257.59" dur="3.72">flavors back in and you have this sort</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="4.5">of like a meat bar like I&amp;#39;ve never made</text>
  <text start="261.31" dur="5.07">it I&amp;#39;ve only read it like a year ago</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="4.46">right but it comes to mind now because</text>
  <text start="266.38" dur="4.499">with something like this</text>
  <text start="268.11" dur="5.86">this could this could disrupt that this</text>
  <text start="270.879" dur="5.76">will disrupt the food supply in at least</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="4.74">on minor areas in different plate-like</text>
  <text start="276.639" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s already so fragile you&amp;#39;re never</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="4.88">more than like one sick day or one miss</text>
  <text start="281.379" dur="5.19">truck away from an empty store shelf so</text>
  <text start="283.59" dur="4.449">and we&amp;#39;ve seen this but before when we</text>
  <text start="286.569" dur="4.44">have a temporary breakdown in the system</text>
  <text start="288.039" dur="4.38">it turns into rioting you turn if you if</text>
  <text start="291.009" dur="3.66">you run out of food stamps temporarily</text>
  <text start="292.419" dur="4.53">it turns into violence turns into chaos</text>
  <text start="294.669" dur="4.201">it turns into small armies of people</text>
  <text start="296.949" dur="4.231">wanting free things and we&amp;#39;ll riot for</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="6.12">it so you have to you have to placate</text>
  <text start="301.18" dur="6.66">those dependent masses because they have</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="5.459">been groomed to a system of dependency</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="4.319">and now now the system is starting to</text>
  <text start="310.449" dur="3.81">get weak we have been told all of our</text>
  <text start="312.159" dur="4.79">lives to rely on the system to rely on</text>
  <text start="314.259" dur="5.041">Big Brother and now Big Brother is dying</text>
  <text start="316.949" dur="5.53">and that&amp;#39;s exactly what this means</text>
  <text start="319.3" dur="7.26">there&amp;#39;s no way a government can maintain</text>
  <text start="322.479" dur="6.541">the power of being the world&amp;#39;s central</text>
  <text start="326.56" dur="4.409">reserve currency without being the</text>
  <text start="329.02" dur="4.41">world&amp;#39;s central reserve currency okay</text>
  <text start="330.969" dur="4.95">period we will have our competitive edge</text>
  <text start="333.43" dur="4.109">America has always been innovative but</text>
  <text start="335.919" dur="2.911">we have a lot to overcome and it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="337.539" dur="3.451">be some hard times ahead</text>
  <text start="338.83" dur="4.589">and I think honestly it&amp;#39;s a good thing</text>
  <text start="340.99" dur="4.62">we need it I just hope my audience is</text>
  <text start="343.419" dur="3.511">prepared I just hope Magga people are</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="3.6">prepared I don&amp;#39;t care about the left</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="4.229">they can stay on their food stamps and</text>
  <text start="349.21" dur="3.48">they can stay in their cities they can</text>

  <text start="430.39" dur="5.43">bullied around about it and a very wise</text>
  <text start="433.57" dur="4.02">thing to do I would imagine if you have</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="4.59">any sort of holistic understanding you</text>
  <text start="437.59" dur="4.95">know that doctors have nothing to do in</text>

  <text start="580.42" dur="4.26">buy like if you go to Amazon and you</text>
  <text start="582.399" dur="4.201">were to buy oil silver which is like 100</text>
  <text start="584.68" dur="3.54">percent effective almost against there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="3.78">very little it won&amp;#39;t kill in terms of</text>
  <text start="588.22" dur="3.69">viruses and bacteria it&amp;#39;s really good</text>
  <text start="590.38" dur="3.48">and it&amp;#39;s completely good for humans</text>
  <text start="591.91" dur="3.54">unless you get the wrong kind of solar</text>
  <text start="593.86" dur="4.83">which will eventually if you drink</text>
  <text start="595.45" dur="6.09">gallons for new blue our area you can</text>
  <text start="598.69" dur="5.25">look up Smurf man but the real colloidal</text>
  <text start="601.54" dur="5.31">silver the actual colloidal not that</text>
  <text start="603.94" dur="4.5">like the man not the ionic silver which</text>
  <text start="606.85" dur="3.42">is what many people sell and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="608.44" dur="3.149">lot of confusion and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="610.27" dur="2.85">demonization of this because it&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="611.589" dur="3.87">those things that really is effective</text>
  <text start="613.12" dur="4.2">and you can prove it to yourself quite</text>
  <text start="615.459" dur="3.061">quickly or even do it in a controlled</text>
  <text start="617.32" dur="2.73">lab setting where you can see the</text>
  <text start="618.52" dur="2.819">bacteria just died or something maybe we</text>
  <text start="620.05" dur="3.69">could do that here on the show I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="621.339" dur="4.051">know to show people just how powerful</text>
  <text start="623.74" dur="3.15">these things are and that&amp;#39;s why I use</text>
  <text start="625.39" dur="3.72">them you know I&amp;#39;ve been researching</text>
  <text start="626.89" dur="4.08">these rabbit holes eight hours a day</text>
  <text start="629.11" dur="3.96">since I was 15 years old and that</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="3.869">includes alternative health rabbit holes</text>
  <text start="633.07" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;ve seen it all I know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.839" dur="3.69">doing I know about the revolving door at</text>
  <text start="636.37" dur="3.959">the FDA and know about all of the the</text>
  <text start="638.529" dur="3.541">cover-ups I know about the murders and</text>
  <text start="640.329" dur="2.851">about the suspicious deaths of all of</text>
  <text start="642.07" dur="2.4">the doctors who were actually healing</text>
  <text start="643.18" dur="3.39">things I know how they went afterwards</text>
  <text start="644.47" dur="3.84">in ski I know about all of the</text>
  <text start="646.57" dur="5.54">alternative treatments I mean it is just</text>
  <text start="648.31" dur="3.8">so much corruption and fraud</text>
  <text start="653.94" dur="5.49">things like late roll I mean things that</text>
  <text start="656.37" dur="5.22">you can&amp;#39;t patent but somebody has to do</text>
  <text start="659.43" dur="4.02">the research for so that we can force it</text>
  <text start="661.59" dur="5.64">through this system so that they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="663.45" dur="5.49">just ban it and kill people you know my</text>
  <text start="667.23" dur="3">friends kind of my second phase of that</text>
  <text start="668.94" dur="4.43">plan I had talked about was gonna</text>
  <text start="670.23" dur="8.28">hopefully fund Brzezinski&amp;#39;s cancer cure</text>
  <text start="673.37" dur="7.18">if I make it that well anyway so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="678.51" dur="4.32">kind of ranted a bit here but you see</text>
  <text start="680.55" dur="4.02">some of the potential I mean you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="682.83" dur="3.33">have to always go to doctors there&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="684.57" dur="5.4">many alternative options and in fact</text>
  <text start="686.16" dur="5.61">everyone you know look into you know not</text>
  <text start="689.97" dur="5.22">medical advice just my thought here but</text>
  <text start="691.77" dur="5.7">look into oil silver as your backup just</text>
  <text start="695.19" dur="4.68">kind of yeah I take it with me even on</text>
  <text start="697.47" dur="4.38">the plane the one you buy and Amazon I</text>
  <text start="699.87" dur="3.42">had mentioned it&amp;#39;s a like ten part per</text>
  <text start="701.85" dur="3.75">million twenty maybe thirty part per</text>
  <text start="703.29" dur="3.57">million arses eleven hundred part per</text>
  <text start="705.6" dur="2.82">million which won&amp;#39;t hurt you but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="706.86" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s a concentrate you can just dilute</text>
  <text start="708.42" dur="5.49">it into mini gallons and that&amp;#39;s a heck</text>
  <text start="712.2" dur="4.56">of a value play I mean when Baba could</text>
  <text start="713.91" dur="4.68">last you for years and then you also</text>
  <text start="716.76" dur="3.81">have some of the basic things that</text>
  <text start="718.59" dur="4.83">people need that they don&amp;#39;t get that</text>
  <text start="720.57" dur="6.3">they&amp;#39;re deficient in like boron like</text>
  <text start="723.42" dur="4.74">magnesium like iodine right and then you</text>
  <text start="726.87" dur="2.73">have to of course get the right quality</text>
  <text start="728.16" dur="2.76">cuz if you just go to Walmart you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="729.6" dur="3.75">gonna get some junk that&amp;#39;s probably bad</text>
  <text start="730.92" dur="3.96">for you right so you have to get the</text>
  <text start="733.35" dur="4.02">right kind of magnesium through your</text>
  <text start="734.88" dur="4.41">Nate or magnesium chloride USP</text>
  <text start="737.37" dur="3.42">which is cheap and high value and good</text>
  <text start="739.29" dur="4.44">absorbability there&amp;#39;s about eight kinds</text>
  <text start="740.79" dur="4.74">of magnesium lugol&amp;#39;s iodine is probably</text>
  <text start="743.73" dur="3.51">the best many people talk about nascent</text>
  <text start="745.53" dur="3.42">iodine but that&amp;#39;s not natural and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="747.24" dur="3.87">been told some of the bonding structure</text>
  <text start="748.95" dur="4.28">that could could maybe not be as good as</text>
  <text start="751.11" dur="5.04">this supposed to be I&amp;#39;m not the expert</text>
  <text start="753.23" dur="5.41">but many of the you know those who are</text>
  <text start="756.15" dur="4.98">the experts are torn on this issue but</text>
  <text start="758.64" dur="6.48">many many many experts still lean toward</text>
  <text start="761.13" dur="5.88">lugol&amp;#39;s iodine as the sort of the best</text>
  <text start="765.12" dur="4.05">of the best and I have a five percent so</text>
  <text start="767.01" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s pretty strong and then there are</text>
  <text start="769.17" dur="6.84">also I think I missed one so we have</text>
  <text start="773.4" dur="4.14">magnesium iodine the boron I&amp;#39;d I use</text>
  <text start="776.01" dur="3.12">borax for my boron which you can get</text>
  <text start="777.54" dur="3.75">cheap or on tablets that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="779.13" dur="4.59">important for bones and hip fractures</text>
  <text start="781.29" dur="4.29">and things as you get older and</text>
  <text start="783.72" dur="4.11">hopefully preventing these things dr.</text>
  <text start="785.58" dur="4.77">noon Hammond and Australia was able to</text>
  <text start="787.83" dur="7.35">in his words cure tens of thousands of</text>
  <text start="790.35" dur="7.53">people of things like arthritis and</text>
  <text start="795.18" dur="4.44">osteoporosis and and prevent things like</text>
  <text start="797.88" dur="4.32">hip fractures and communities that were</text>
  <text start="799.62" dur="4.08">using this or had it in the soil even in</text>
  <text start="802.2" dur="4.05">the animals they didn&amp;#39;t get the kind of</text>
  <text start="803.7" dur="5.46">bone decay as they age that most people</text>
  <text start="806.25" dur="6.75">get so this thing is just not in all</text>
  <text start="809.16" dur="5.46">soils right it&amp;#39;s just boron and borax</text>
  <text start="813" dur="3.18">actually has quite a bit of it and is</text>
  <text start="814.62" dur="3.42">safer than salt according to the</text>
  <text start="816.18" dur="6.33">government although I don&amp;#39;t trust the</text>
  <text start="818.04" dur="5.97">government and we have yeah these things</text>
  <text start="822.51" dur="3.18">are pretty easy to make yourself I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="824.01" dur="2.79">given the recipes away I&amp;#39;ve got videos</text>
  <text start="825.69" dur="2.91">on and I have a whole channel dedicated</text>
  <text start="826.8" dur="4.38">to that on YouTube you&amp;#39;ve probably never</text>
