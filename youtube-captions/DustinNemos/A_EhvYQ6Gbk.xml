  <text start="573.28" dur="4.98">lot of time to go through all of that</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="4.47">and most people I think come to this</text>
  <text start="578.26" dur="3.54">show just for sort of a brief overview</text>
  <text start="579.79" dur="5.64">but I like to leave sources and</text>
  <text start="581.8" dur="7.2">everything else I&amp;#39;m building my economic</text>
  <text start="585.43" dur="4.95">page and you know there&amp;#39;s gonna be kind</text>
  <text start="589" dur="3.21">of a distinction between economics and</text>

  <text start="592.21" dur="4.86">overlap as well and I&amp;#39;m gonna even do a</text>
  <text start="595.24" dur="5.09">section on precious metals things like</text>
  <text start="597.07" dur="7.08">that this is gonna have a lot of very</text>
  <text start="600.33" dur="5.23">useful information in economics and if</text>
  <text start="604.15" dur="3.84">you watch this stuff you&amp;#39;ll learn kind</text>
  <text start="605.56" dur="5.1">of an idea of where things are at right</text>
  <text start="607.99" dur="4.44">now and if I find really important</text>
  <text start="610.66" dur="6.9">things I&amp;#39;m gonna put them on there but</text>
  <text start="612.43" dur="7.08">some of the things are very situational</text>
  <text start="617.56" dur="3.87">like they&amp;#39;re important that day but it</text>
  <text start="619.51" dur="3.6">changes day to day so it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="3.48">that useful a month later and those are</text>
  <text start="623.11" dur="4.47">not necessarily videos that I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="624.91" dur="4.98">put up however if something really major</text>
  <text start="627.58" dur="4.59">is happening I will warn you about it so</text>
  <text start="629.89" dur="5.34">that you can you know give it kind of a</text>

  <text start="909.36" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s still a developing technology but</text>
  <text start="911.64" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s getting to be very convenient and</text>

  <text start="932.16" dur="3.24">support the the centralized versions</text>

  <text start="938.79" dur="3.93">and those centralized coins are a</text>
  <text start="940.86" dur="3.78">legitimate threat to a dystopian future</text>
  <text start="942.72" dur="5.85">we really don&amp;#39;t want to support those</text>
  <text start="944.64" dur="5.85">centralized coins that are managed at a</text>

  <text start="966.96" dur="5.16">with Bitcoin but crypto currencies that</text>
  <text start="970.17" dur="4.83">are decentralized it&amp;#39;s just do not work</text>
  <text start="972.12" dur="4.53">that way they are not no one can go into</text>
  <text start="975" dur="6.06">them and do anything to them like that</text>
  <text start="976.65" dur="7.38">and the overall report showed that</text>

  <text start="1245.79" dur="3.9">you know half price or or pennies on the</text>
  <text start="1247.8" dur="5.64">dollar because everyone&amp;#39;s now poorer and</text>
  <text start="1249.69" dur="5.51">the market is is tanked which is kind of</text>
  <text start="1253.44" dur="4.59">how they do these boom and bust cycles</text>
