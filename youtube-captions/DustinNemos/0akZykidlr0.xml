  <text start="47.789" dur="3.511">can make a note on this this</text>
  <text start="49.59" dur="3.899">cryptocurrency which is very popular</text>
  <text start="51.3" dur="5.46">these days I look at it it&amp;#39;s just a new</text>
  <text start="53.489" dur="5.34">tool to get more privacy alright and in</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="4.26">in that in establishing cryptocurrency</text>
  <text start="58.829" dur="4.32">we have this new thing that&amp;#39;s new to</text>
  <text start="61.02" dur="3.69">most people which is encryption people</text>
  <text start="63.149" dur="3.631">don&amp;#39;t think about private communications</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="4.8">and actually our money supply is</text>
  <text start="66.78" dur="3.87">becoming a matter of communication so</text>
  <text start="69.51" dur="3.149">that&amp;#39;s what really crypto is really</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="4.31">about but I look at it like just another</text>
  <text start="72.659" dur="4.741">tool where you know ten years ago</text>
  <text start="74.96" dur="4.269">privacy might just mean I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="77.4" dur="3.78">business in a company name or I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="79.229" dur="4.801">have part of my holdings and precious</text>
  <text start="81.18" dur="5.4">metals that was pretty much what you get</text>
  <text start="84.03" dur="5.67">you know with privacy all you had yeah</text>
  <text start="86.58" dur="4.59">right that&amp;#39;s the limit with now with</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="3.059">Kryptos and the technology that comes</text>
  <text start="91.17" dur="4.05">with it we have a lot more options I</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="4.261">feel like the banking hold is really</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="3.3">slipping on that but you know III</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="4.8">mentioned this before a lot of my</text>
  <text start="98.52" dur="4.529">audience are are very skeptical and then</text>
  <text start="101.82" dur="4.079">they&amp;#39;re very you know they&amp;#39;re old school</text>
  <text start="103.049" dur="4.561">gold silver kind of guys and I was -</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="3.301">I&amp;#39;ve got silver on my bookshelf I talk</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="3.78">about silver a lot I think it&amp;#39;s a better</text>
  <text start="109.2" dur="4.14">deal than gold but you know I was a</text>
  <text start="111.39" dur="4.769">silver bug who came to Bitcoin late and</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="4.44">I regret doing it but I also know that</text>
  <text start="116.159" dur="3.511">the you know with the ETFs and the</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="3.36">manipulation there&amp;#39;s really no way that</text>
  <text start="119.67" dur="3.21">this stuff&amp;#39;s gonna ever soar until the</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="3.36">whole system crashes anyway and then I</text>
  <text start="122.88" dur="4.71">just think that crypto is a better</text>
  <text start="124.5" dur="4.619">option personally yeah yeah me my wife</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="3.92">just probably some silver there&amp;#39;s little</text>
  <text start="129.119" dur="5.87">to ounce yeah I&amp;#39;ve got a Valentin</text>
  <text start="131.51" dur="6.24">is a station piece and that&amp;#39;s all it is</text>
  <text start="134.989" dur="5.551">for now because it&amp;#39;s basically it&amp;#39;s 1913</text>
  <text start="137.75" dur="5.579">prices it&amp;#39;s a paperweight for now yeah</text>
  <text start="140.54" dur="5.399">it&amp;#39;s until until the whole system crash</text>
  <text start="143.329" dur="4.351">isn&amp;#39;t and then you&amp;#39;re good to go you</text>
  <text start="145.939" dur="4.14">know it does take a lot of patience and</text>
  <text start="147.68" dur="4.949">I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for from so long oh my</text>
  <text start="150.079" dur="3.901">silver to go up well good that I know</text>
  <text start="152.629" dur="4.021">it&amp;#39;s a long time to wait but it&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="153.98" dur="4.259">that it is yeah what what would you say</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="3.66">to people who are of the older</text>
  <text start="158.239" dur="5.191">generation old mindset you know the</text>
  <text start="160.31" dur="5.31">skeptical folks well I am too but I like</text>
  <text start="163.43" dur="4.529">Kryptos I like technology and I like it</text>
  <text start="165.62" dur="3.72">for this youth the utility of I can take</text>
  <text start="167.959" dur="4.261">my silver I could take a whole bar of</text>
  <text start="169.34" dur="4.92">silver and I can move it to Singapore in</text>
  <text start="172.22" dur="4.049">a vault if you wanted to do that right</text>
  <text start="174.26" dur="4.17">the way I would do it is I would sell it</text>
  <text start="176.269" dur="4.651">here in the States and I would turn it</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="4.919">into Bitcoin simply and I would use my</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="4.459">Bitcoin to buy that same bar or one just</text>
  <text start="183.349" dur="5.131">like it in the foreign vault service</text>
  <text start="185.379" dur="4.72">okay you expect you trust these foreign</text>
  <text start="188.48" dur="3.599">vaults and stuff I&amp;#39;ve never realized my</text>
  <text start="190.099" dur="4.021">betting process and there are some vault</text>
  <text start="192.079" dur="4.261">services that I do trust to do that and</text>
  <text start="194.12" dur="5.6">I can liquidate my silver I can take my</text>
  <text start="196.34" dur="6.989">hundred ounce bar and I can turn it into</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="6.25">99 ounce rounds and I could take one</text>
  <text start="203.329" dur="5.31">round and buy some coffee with it on my</text>
  <text start="205.97" dur="4.68">phone because I can transfer it back in</text>
  <text start="208.639" dur="5.07">a Bitcoin so now they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="210.65" dur="4.29">together yes and that&amp;#39;s just piecing</text>
  <text start="213.709" dur="3.42">services together there are other</text>
  <text start="214.94" dur="4.35">services where I can hold money in</text>
  <text start="217.129" dur="4.2">cryptos and I can have a debit card and</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="5.599">at the point-of-sale pay for in dollars</text>
  <text start="221.329" dur="5.19">but even though it&amp;#39;s in Bitcoin yeah so</text>
  <text start="224.889" dur="3.341">this place</text>
  <text start="226.519" dur="3.241">here&amp;#39;s let me ask about that because the</text>
  <text start="228.23" dur="3.42">one that I have links up to coinbase</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="3.27">which I know is basically just an IRS</text>
  <text start="231.65" dur="4.14">front group at this point they did try</text>
  <text start="233.03" dur="6.03">to fight it you know but they lost and</text>
  <text start="235.79" dur="5.55">the IRS case they did a good job yeah</text>
  <text start="239.06" dur="4.56">and they basically were hijacked by</text>
  <text start="241.34" dur="3.959">financial crimes Network yeah so if we</text>
  <text start="243.62" dur="3.36">can&amp;#39;t trust that is there another better</text>
  <text start="245.299" dur="3.241">option for the Bitcoin cuz I looked into</text>
  <text start="246.98" dur="4.229">this I couldn&amp;#39;t find anything that was</text>
  <text start="248.54" dur="5.159">available in the US well private wallets</text>
  <text start="251.209" dur="4.59">so Exodus is an example of a wallet</text>
  <text start="253.699" dur="5.28">well good debit card I mean specifically</text>
  <text start="255.799" dur="4.41">okay so yeah there are others I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="258.979" dur="3.211">know any other ones in particular in</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="3.481">fact I don&amp;#39;t use them that much you know</text>
  <text start="262.19" dur="2.94">people that use them so I would just</text>
  <text start="263.69" dur="2.76">keep searching I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="265.13" dur="3.3">sure there there are some good ones now</text>
  <text start="266.45" dur="3.12">and they&amp;#39;re gonna be better ones when it</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="3">comes to privacy you&amp;#39;re just not gonna</text>
  <text start="269.57" dur="4.32">have any with coinbase that you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="271.43" dur="4.11">still not gonna have any with a personal</text>
  <text start="273.89" dur="3.06">bank account either so the same</text>

  <text start="300.53" dur="2.58">if you tried to take a couple hundred</text>
  <text start="301.67" dur="3.81">ounces of gold or silver out of the</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="3.24">country you would not leave with it it</text>

  <text start="311.42" dur="3.3">time I took this is about 20 years ago I</text>

  <text start="314.72" dur="4.14">Canadian maple leaves just for fun we</text>
  <text start="317.27" dur="3.51">went on vacation to Vancouver and I took</text>
  <text start="318.86" dur="4.65">a whole bag of them like a big tube of</text>
  <text start="320.78" dur="4.62">them really and through security and</text>
  <text start="323.51" dur="3">they just wanted to find out what it was</text>
  <text start="325.4" dur="3.18">they thought it was a pipe or something</text>
  <text start="326.51" dur="4.02">like that right so when they thought I</text>

  <text start="345.89" dur="5.88">body scanner things but so what are some</text>
  <text start="349.19" dur="5.1">of the like your favorite topics in the</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="3.93">now not necessarily you have a lot of</text>
  <text start="354.29" dur="3.3">experience you can do a lot of things in</text>
  <text start="355.7" dur="4.17">the old system but but in the now where</text>
  <text start="357.59" dur="4.98">where are you focusing well I&amp;#39;m looking</text>
  <text start="359.87" dur="4.44">at encryption for people&amp;#39;s money yeah</text>
  <text start="362.57" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s my big focus right now and also</text>
  <text start="364.31" dur="5.94">communications so there&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="367.04" dur="5.1">tools for that encryption encrypted</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="3.3">websites Virtual Private Networks for</text>
  <text start="372.14" dur="4.86">your internet connection that&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="6.39">important thing to have devices like</text>
  <text start="377" dur="4.86">such as the ledger the ledger nan-oh for</text>
  <text start="379.94" dur="4.2">example as a brand name that is a good</text>
  <text start="381.86" dur="4.8">device in my opinion for encrypting your</text>
  <text start="384.14" dur="4.2">access to kryptos got my bit fee finally</text>
  <text start="386.66" dur="3.75">yeah okay</text>
  <text start="388.34" dur="4.35">there&amp;#39;s other ways to you know paper</text>
  <text start="390.41" dur="3.9">wallets I I use a version of paper</text>
  <text start="392.69" dur="3.27">wallets that I made up myself basically</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="3.96">I take the private keys and storm in a</text>
  <text start="395.96" dur="3.179">file and the file is encrypted and</text>
  <text start="398.27" dur="3.329">sometimes like I</text>
  <text start="399.139" dur="5.34">shown you before sometimes I keep data</text>
  <text start="401.599" dur="3.69">in this you know ledger this book I got</text>
  <text start="404.479" dur="3.27">at Barnes and Noble</text>
  <text start="405.289" dur="4.38">blank pages you know leather-bound book</text>
  <text start="407.749" dur="5.16">and I keep it my ball and I can actually</text>
  <text start="409.669" dur="7.411">keep my seed codes and encryption keys</text>
  <text start="412.909" dur="6.451">in the paper yeah that&amp;#39;s very cool yeah</text>
  <text start="417.08" dur="3.75">it would probably be very effective if</text>
  <text start="419.36" dur="3.089">you took some of these like advanced</text>
  <text start="420.83" dur="3.63">ciphers like the bill cipher or</text>
  <text start="422.449" dur="3.391">something and then had your own cipher</text>
  <text start="424.46" dur="4.739">for your book that no one even if they</text>
  <text start="425.84" dur="4.59">got your book they make that yeah you</text>
  <text start="429.199" dur="3.451">can do things like that you can be very</text>
  <text start="430.43" dur="5.609">creative like passwords a password can</text>
  <text start="432.65" dur="4.919">be a passage in your favorite poem just</text>
  <text start="436.039" dur="2.37">one line in your favorite poem and then</text>

  <text start="452.21" dur="8.31">for sure yep okay so you know beyond</text>
  <text start="456.759" dur="5.891">beyond crypto and communications what</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="3.75">can we what can we use for this what are</text>
  <text start="462.65" dur="3.6">the real-world applications to help the</text>
  <text start="464.27" dur="4.799">everyday person well can we talk</text>
  <text start="466.25" dur="4.62">old-school yeah here&amp;#39;s what I do for</text>
  <text start="469.069" dur="3.541">this is why I came up with the whole</text>
  <text start="470.87" dur="3.18">idea when I started working with about</text>
  <text start="472.61" dur="3.929">25 years ago working with people</text>
  <text start="474.05" dur="4.38">consumers that had debt and so I would</text>
  <text start="476.539" dur="4.171">work the problem through the legal</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="4.139">system and then I realized what I was</text>
  <text start="480.71" dur="3.84">dealing with was a privacy problem it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="482.569" dur="4.53">a privacy issue or if I can make these</text>
  <text start="484.55" dur="4.47">people that their information disappear</text>
  <text start="487.099" dur="4.29">on paper we could do all kinds of things</text>
  <text start="489.02" dur="4.619">we could avoid lawsuits we could even</text>
  <text start="491.389" dur="5.161">create a situation where if they were</text>
  <text start="493.639" dur="6.03">sued the judgment couldn&amp;#39;t be used to</text>
  <text start="496.55" dur="4.47">levy their paycheck which is really</text>
  <text start="499.669" dur="2.701">you&amp;#39;re not gonna find anybody that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="501.02" dur="3.48">gonna even think like this like how can</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="3.84">you here to think that unless you go to</text>
  <text start="504.5" dur="3.93">bankruptcy right because bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="506.21" dur="4.739">today has been gutted bankruptcies are</text>
  <text start="508.43" dur="3.779">nothing but a payment plan how do I keep</text>
  <text start="510.949" dur="2.76">them out of your stuff even the</text>
  <text start="512.209" dur="2.791">government yeah that&amp;#39;s amazing you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.709" dur="2.671">not you&amp;#39;re just not gonna do it unless</text>
  <text start="515" dur="2.729">you know a couple of tricks and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.38" dur="3.63">the here&amp;#39;s where I got the tricks from</text>
  <text start="517.729" dur="4.141">really in the in the tax code there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="520.01" dur="4.56">provision that says to the IRS you can</text>
  <text start="521.87" dur="4.92">take property or rights to property of</text>
  <text start="524.57" dur="4.86">the taxpayer or whoever is obligated</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="5.52">right so I figured okay if I can beat</text>
  <text start="529.43" dur="3.45">the IRS legally then I can be Citibank</text>
  <text start="532.31" dur="3.33">and I can be</text>
  <text start="532.88" dur="4.5">everybody else on an unsecured debt so</text>
  <text start="535.64" dur="3.42">what I decided to do is create a</text>
  <text start="537.38" dur="3.96">situation where people have a bank</text>
  <text start="539.06" dur="5.04">account that can&amp;#39;t be levied and the way</text>
  <text start="541.34" dur="4.53">I do it is I divest the user of the</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="4.68">account from his exclusive right to</text>
  <text start="545.87" dur="5.07">spend the money so so I make it like</text>
  <text start="548.78" dur="4.08">this I make your bank account so that</text>
  <text start="550.94" dur="4.41">you it looks like you&amp;#39;re signing for</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="4.56">your church right so if you have</text>
  <text start="555.35" dur="3.24">personal debts the creditor can&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="557.42" dur="2.7">the money from your church to pay those</text>
  <text start="558.59" dur="2.91">debts even though you&amp;#39;re a sign on the</text>
  <text start="560.12" dur="3.81">church&amp;#39;s a Kindle right we all know that</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="3.24">so how do I create that situation for a</text>
  <text start="563.93" dur="3.18">personal account</text>
  <text start="564.74" dur="3.75">well I open a new account where the</text>
  <text start="567.11" dur="3.75">person I&amp;#39;m working with is either an</text>
  <text start="568.49" dur="5.07">agent of a company or has some other</text>
  <text start="570.86" dur="4.71">status where he&amp;#39;s changing the rights on</text>
  <text start="573.56" dur="4.08">the signature card so the bank</text>
  <text start="575.57" dur="4.11">recognizes if the IRS recognizes it and</text>
  <text start="577.64" dur="4.02">anybody trying to do a levy is gonna</text>
  <text start="579.68" dur="3.24">recognize they can&amp;#39;t touch it because a</text>
  <text start="581.66" dur="3.15">lot of times the people with all the</text>
  <text start="582.92" dur="3.99">money the super rich people are doing</text>
  <text start="584.81" dur="6.18">this anyways and so they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="586.91" dur="5.91">ruin that system before my my mentor</text>
  <text start="590.99" dur="3.66">partner guru person I mentioned about</text>
  <text start="592.82" dur="3.06">real estate embezzled and then ran off</text>
  <text start="594.65" dur="4.14">and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure she&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="595.88" dur="4.59">prison before all event happened she had</text>
  <text start="598.79" dur="4.17">like all these different trusts and</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="4.05">things set up and and you know it was</text>
  <text start="602.96" dur="3.66">very confusing for me but at the same</text>
  <text start="604.52" dur="3.57">point I figured it was just how you do</text>
  <text start="606.62" dur="3.09">business you know LLC&amp;#39;s and trusts</text>
  <text start="608.09" dur="3.99">everything else is this just that is</text>
  <text start="609.71" dur="4.65">this just having a trust or is this</text>
  <text start="612.08" dur="3.96">beyond now okay you can use these</text>
  <text start="614.36" dur="3.45">strategies some of these ideas you can</text>
  <text start="616.04" dur="4.56">use it to cheat people I mean obviously</text>
  <text start="617.81" dur="4.11">you can cheat people anyway I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="3.66">to connect with anybody who&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="621.92" dur="4.23">that but yeah I mean like for myself</text>
  <text start="624.26" dur="4.38">okay I have a lot of things going on and</text>
  <text start="626.15" dur="4.83">I only use a few companies yeah which</text>
  <text start="628.64" dur="4.29">she did was just stealing outright so</text>
  <text start="630.98" dur="4.8">it&amp;#39;s not the trust that I&amp;#39;m upset with</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the yeah you don&amp;#39;t need many</text>
  <text start="635.78" dur="2.94">structures and things and trust</text>
  <text start="637.07" dur="3.93">organizations to do I mean unless you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="638.72" dur="4.23">really like the Clintons right if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="641" dur="3.84">really stealing money from a government</text>
  <text start="642.95" dur="3.96">that&amp;#39;s you know you need all that stuff</text>
  <text start="644.84" dur="4.32">I don&amp;#39;t know you only need a couple of</text>
  <text start="646.91" dur="5.36">things to do to get the privacy you want</text>
  <text start="649.16" dur="5.37">so for banking you want to set up</text>
  <text start="652.27" dur="4.18">non-exclusivity on your accounts so that</text>
  <text start="654.53" dur="3.84">way the money they counts not yours</text>
  <text start="656.45" dur="3.45">legally although you can spend it and</text>
  <text start="658.37" dur="3.33">pay for your groceries and you can get</text>
  <text start="659.9" dur="3.24">into an investment you can open a</text>
  <text start="661.7" dur="3.78">trading account the stock market if you</text>
  <text start="663.14" dur="5.069">want to do that you can do it where your</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="4.5">not the exclusive party so that way if</text>
  <text start="668.209" dur="3.38">someone suing you or loving you he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="4.44">take the money in your trading account</text>
  <text start="671.589" dur="5.081">only those under the contract can do it</text>
  <text start="674.42" dur="3.419">looks like the brokerage house can do</text>
  <text start="676.67" dur="3.45">what it needs to do to operate the</text>
  <text start="677.839" dur="4.471">account like margin calls and things</text>
  <text start="680.12" dur="5.82">like that but a creditor can&amp;#39;t take that</text>
  <text start="682.31" dur="4.92">money if you set it up that way mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="685.94" dur="3">one of the experiences I had in the</text>
  <text start="687.23" dur="3.84">beginning was I I set up my company</text>
  <text start="688.94" dur="3.54">originally as an international business</text>
  <text start="691.07" dur="3.42">company and I don&amp;#39;t know why I did that</text>
  <text start="692.48" dur="4.14">it was like 20-something years ago and I</text>
  <text start="694.49" dur="5.43">did it for a few years now I use local</text>
  <text start="696.62" dur="5.76">companies and I had it situated in a</text>
  <text start="699.92" dur="4.05">foreign country and someone sued my</text>
  <text start="702.38" dur="2.639">company to try to actually shut it down</text>
  <text start="703.97" dur="3.9">they were trying to steal my whole</text>
  <text start="705.019" dur="4.411">company by suing me yeah it was crazy so</text>
  <text start="707.87" dur="2.61">anyways they couldn&amp;#39;t serve it they</text>
  <text start="709.43" dur="3.149">didn&amp;#39;t know how to serve the summons</text>
  <text start="710.48" dur="4.469">because of how I had it structured this</text>
  <text start="712.579" dur="4.591">is just by mistake I didn&amp;#39;t even think</text>
  <text start="714.949" dur="3.811">of this as a risk and this is how I</text>
  <text start="717.17" dur="3.539">learned okay so if I do it things that</text>
  <text start="718.76" dur="3.54">way from now on okay I can so anyways</text>
  <text start="720.709" dur="3.12">they couldn&amp;#39;t serve the company so they</text>
  <text start="722.3" dur="3.599">failed and the attorney got so</text>
  <text start="723.829" dur="3.841">frustrated she sent me the pleading my</text>
  <text start="725.899" dur="3.81">email and she said please tell us how to</text>
  <text start="727.67" dur="3.99">serve this and of course I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="729.709" dur="4.231">do that right so I showed it to my</text>
  <text start="731.66" dur="3.869">attorney we had a big laugh and then we</text>
  <text start="733.94" dur="3.089">ended up suing them and they withdrew</text>
  <text start="735.529" dur="4.081">and we won like two and a half million</text>
  <text start="737.029" dur="5.581">dollars penny yes but that&amp;#39;s saved my</text>
  <text start="739.61" dur="5.55">but you know just just not being able to</text>
  <text start="742.61" dur="4.68">be served right so when I rent went</text>
  <text start="745.16" dur="3.72">through that experience I figured how</text>
  <text start="747.29" dur="4.02">can I do that for somebody who might</text>
  <text start="748.88" dur="4.17">have let&amp;#39;s say seven credit cards that</text>
  <text start="751.31" dur="3.24">he&amp;#39;s not gonna pay he&amp;#39;s gonna get sued</text>
  <text start="753.05" dur="3.36">by at least two or three of them in the</text>
  <text start="754.55" dur="4.409">next year or two how can I make it work</text>
  <text start="756.41" dur="4.08">he doesn&amp;#39;t even get sued so what I did</text>
  <text start="758.959" dur="3.06">is I came up with a procedure where I</text>
  <text start="760.49" dur="3.63">actually make it look like he moved to</text>
  <text start="762.019" dur="4.351">another state and the state he moves to</text>
  <text start="764.12" dur="5.43">on paper does not allow wage</text>
  <text start="766.37" dur="5.25">garnishments like Pennsylvania doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="769.55" dur="3.45">allow North Carolina doesn&amp;#39;t allow Texas</text>
  <text start="771.62" dur="4.26">doesn&amp;#39;t allow in their four states and</text>
  <text start="773" dur="4.41">then that way what happened would happen</text>
  <text start="775.88" dur="2.819">is the cases would get assigned to an</text>
  <text start="777.41" dur="3.33">attorney in those states and the</text>
  <text start="778.699" dur="3.421">attorney would visibly you can see he</text>
  <text start="780.74" dur="2.909">was trying to serve it but he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="782.12" dur="4.68">know the person was still in Oklahoma</text>
  <text start="783.649" dur="6.961">and the person would never get served</text>
  <text start="786.8" dur="5.64">and there&amp;#39;s no risk yeah so he can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="790.61" dur="4.469">served he can&amp;#39;t get sued and it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="792.44" dur="5.249">legal and aboveboard just too smart I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="795.079" dur="3.461">using their system I use the credit file</text>
  <text start="797.689" dur="3.281">and the</text>
  <text start="798.54" dur="4.44">Postal Service to do this and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="800.97" dur="5.04">even use legal like lawsuits or anything</text>
  <text start="802.98" dur="4.92">like that to be clear like we both agree</text>
  <text start="806.01" dur="3.27">on this this is something you just kind</text>
  <text start="807.9" dur="3">of like gun rights and it&amp;#39;s like an</text>
  <text start="809.28" dur="3.96">amendment like it&amp;#39;s a useful tool it can</text>
  <text start="810.9" dur="4.26">be abused but yes use morally and</text>
  <text start="813.24" dur="3.6">responsibly I know I&amp;#39;ve had a couple</text>
  <text start="815.16" dur="3.3">people call me and they tell me about</text>
  <text start="816.84" dur="3.54">some scheme they were doing I was like</text>
  <text start="818.46" dur="4.23">I&amp;#39;m not in it I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not now call</text>
  <text start="820.38" dur="6.03">somebody else you know there&amp;#39;s plenty of</text>
  <text start="822.69" dur="5.4">good people to help so you know a lot of</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="3.39">this is is complicated is it is</text>
  <text start="828.09" dur="3.48">expensive to set up is it is it</text>
  <text start="829.8" dur="5.37">difficult to set up know a thing like</text>
  <text start="831.57" dur="4.95">that I mean as far as cost to do the the</text>
  <text start="835.17" dur="4.89">change of address type of deal that</text>
  <text start="836.52" dur="4.89">takes about a week and maybe it&amp;#39;s $15</text>

  <text start="940.05" dur="5.97">Google and go through its privacy policy</text>
  <text start="942.48" dur="6.9">and have Google fix it the way I client</text>
  <text start="946.02" dur="4.8">wanted it so not like removing it</text>

  <text start="1103.61" dur="4.289">the 1913 central bank and before that</text>
  <text start="1106.429" dur="2.821">when they had tried before to do central</text>
  <text start="1107.899" dur="3.721">banks you know it&amp;#39;s just been one long</text>
  <text start="1109.25" dur="6.899">constant war for fair money in our</text>
  <text start="1111.62" dur="6.57">country well I&amp;#39;ll tell you what most</text>
  <text start="1116.149" dur="4.38">people can identify with is over the</text>
  <text start="1118.19" dur="4.65">last 30 or 40 years the bankruptcy rules</text>
  <text start="1120.529" dur="4.561">have been gutted and changed by the</text>
  <text start="1122.84" dur="3.929">banks so that you no longer have real</text>
  <text start="1125.09" dur="3.719">bankruptcy like used to have where you</text>
  <text start="1126.769" dur="2.821">could protect your house in your car you</text>
  <text start="1128.809" dur="2.911">just trashed</text>
  <text start="1129.59" dur="4.589">I mean basically chapter 13 as a payment</text>
  <text start="1131.72" dur="4.319">plan so bankruptcy has become a brand</text>
  <text start="1134.179" dur="3.301">name only that it doesn&amp;#39;t serve people</text>
  <text start="1136.039" dur="3.331">anymore it serves the banking system</text>
  <text start="1137.48" dur="4.199">which is really sinister we can get into</text>
  <text start="1139.37" dur="4.35">that too but what the banks have done is</text>
  <text start="1141.679" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;ve made it so that they can take</text>
  <text start="1143.72" dur="6.12">mortgages their long-term debt where</text>
  <text start="1146.779" dur="5.311">consumers that work in the real world go</text>
  <text start="1149.84" dur="4.35">out and labor and then pay on that debt</text>
  <text start="1152.09" dur="5.01">over a long period of time indentured</text>
  <text start="1154.19" dur="5.55">servitude is rated by the person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1157.1" dur="4.98">credit which he&amp;#39;s gonna try to keep it</text>
  <text start="1159.74" dur="4.23">high so he can be rewarded right like</text>
  <text start="1162.08" dur="3.39">the Chinese system yeah so yeah it</text>
  <text start="1163.97" dur="4.23">really is it&amp;#39;s a social engineering</text>
  <text start="1165.47" dur="3.6">mechanism so the banks then engineered a</text>
  <text start="1168.2" dur="2.609">way where they could take these</text>
  <text start="1169.07" dur="6.239">mortgages and they can sell fractions of</text>
  <text start="1170.809" dur="7.83">them and they can sell obligations on</text>
  <text start="1175.309" dur="6.75">top of those mortgages to foreign</text>
  <text start="1178.639" dur="5.37">pension funds and they can use the</text>
  <text start="1182.059" dur="4.86">mortgages that we have taken out in</text>
  <text start="1184.009" dur="5.431">America to steal foreign pension funds</text>
  <text start="1186.919" dur="4.98">and that&amp;#39;s been going on now for at</text>
  <text start="1189.44" dur="5.66">least well since the 80s okay the only</text>
  <text start="1191.899" dur="5.22">way that works is if on the back end if</text>
  <text start="1195.1" dur="3.519">representations can be made by our</text>
  <text start="1197.119" dur="2.401">banking system let&amp;#39;s say people on Wall</text>
  <text start="1198.619" dur="2.701">Street to</text>
  <text start="1199.52" dur="5.7">the foreign governments that these</text>
  <text start="1201.32" dur="5.88">obligations will will be upheld because</text>
  <text start="1205.22" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re on not only because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1207.2" dur="3.87">against real estate in America but</text>
  <text start="1209.36" dur="4.83">because the banks are able to guarantee</text>
  <text start="1211.07" dur="5.1">that they will take the property that</text>
  <text start="1214.19" dur="3.39">this collateralized and the only way you</text>
  <text start="1216.17" dur="2.61">can guarantee like if you go to an</text>
  <text start="1217.58" dur="3.3">attorney for help on something he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1218.78" dur="3.78">never gonna guarantee the results but I</text>
  <text start="1220.88" dur="2.97">know that in Wall Street they guarantee</text>
  <text start="1222.56" dur="4.38">the results because they&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="1223.85" dur="5.25">engineered our court system into</text>
  <text start="1226.94" dur="4.86">becoming broker-dealers for these</text>
  <text start="1229.1" dur="5.75">securities you&amp;#39;re not talking to a judge</text>
  <text start="1231.8" dur="7.23">or a court it&amp;#39;s a broker-dealer system</text>
  <text start="1234.85" dur="5.86">and we&amp;#39;re surrounded by this in my</text>
  <text start="1239.03" dur="3.72">opinion and I think you agree Kryptos</text>
  <text start="1240.71" dur="4.86">are the the best answer for that because</text>
  <text start="1242.75" dur="4.38">if you oh you you can choose to pay but</text>
  <text start="1245.57" dur="4.02">if you don&amp;#39;t and it&amp;#39;s an unfair system</text>
  <text start="1247.13" dur="4.95">no one can ever take you by force oh I</text>
  <text start="1249.59" dur="4.26">think what&amp;#39;s gonna happen is I think</text>
  <text start="1252.08" dur="3.87">cryptos are eating our money supply and</text>
  <text start="1253.85" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s gonna help us but I think Kryptos</text>
  <text start="1255.95" dur="4.32">are gonna find their place in consumer</text>
  <text start="1259.01" dur="3.87">lending when it comes to large</text>
  <text start="1260.27" dur="3.96">transactions and I also think that the</text>
  <text start="1262.88" dur="3.36">30-year mortgage is completely</text>
  <text start="1264.23" dur="3.99">unnecessary because it&amp;#39;s subsidizing the</text>
  <text start="1266.24" dur="4.56">price of real estate among other things</text>
  <text start="1268.22" dur="5.46">but the 30-year mortgage should not be</text>
  <text start="1270.8" dur="5.04">legal we should have no more than a</text>
  <text start="1273.68" dur="4.44">7-year mortgage and if you have a seven</text>
  <text start="1275.84" dur="4.95">year mortgage now you can bring Kryptos</text>
  <text start="1278.12" dur="5.28">in and you can have crowdfunding for</text>
  <text start="1280.79" dur="4.35">mortgage financing for consumers and I</text>
  <text start="1283.4" dur="3.42">think that&amp;#39;s going to be a fair deal and</text>
  <text start="1285.14" dur="4.71">I think we&amp;#39;re gonna see that and</text>
  <text start="1286.82" dur="4.53">probably as we approach the year 2022</text>
  <text start="1289.85" dur="3.48">probably in about four or five years</text>
  <text start="1291.35" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re gonna see that one so fast yeah</text>
  <text start="1293.33" dur="2.79">yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="1294.41" dur="2.7">I want to backtrack to the bankruptcy</text>
  <text start="1296.12" dur="2.85">thing you mentioned that is there</text>
  <text start="1297.11" dur="4.41">anything that these these young people</text>
  <text start="1298.97" dur="4.8">like whoo-hoo you know foolishly and and</text>
  <text start="1301.52" dur="4.74">you know we&amp;#39;re tricked into getting into</text>
  <text start="1303.77" dur="4.47">these unbanked able student loan debts</text>
  <text start="1306.26" dur="3.45">and they&amp;#39;re kind of just indentured</text>
  <text start="1308.24" dur="4.05">servants the rest of their lives is</text>
  <text start="1309.71" dur="4.68">there anything that they can do well I</text>
  <text start="1312.29" dur="4.05">always recommend okay there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="1314.39" dur="3.51">things one is pay right so how do you</text>
  <text start="1316.34" dur="4.05">pay well you can pay with unsecured</text>
  <text start="1317.9" dur="4.02">credit so you can build up unsecured</text>
  <text start="1320.39" dur="3.18">credit even with sniz loan debt and</text>
  <text start="1321.92" dur="2.85">shift it over and once you get an</text>
  <text start="1323.57" dur="3.24">unsecured credit it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1324.77" dur="3">uncollectible if you follow a couple of</text>
  <text start="1326.81" dur="3.09">strategies okay</text>
  <text start="1327.77" dur="3.9">brilliant yeah when it comes to do a</text>
  <text start="1329.9" dur="3.12">loans it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not totally</text>
  <text start="1331.67" dur="3.39">uncollectible but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1333.02" dur="3.75">nearly uncollectible if you understand a</text>
  <text start="1335.06" dur="3.03">few things like set up your banking</text>
  <text start="1336.77" dur="3.27">properly so they can&amp;#39;t levy your</text>
  <text start="1338.09" dur="4.35">accounts at some point you&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="1340.04" dur="5.46">to pay let&amp;#39;s say for example and then</text>
  <text start="1342.44" dur="4.74">the worst that you can have is where the</text>
  <text start="1345.5" dur="3.54">do e or student loan a guarantee you</text>
  <text start="1347.18" dur="4.68">student loan collection will levy</text>
  <text start="1349.04" dur="4.68">a fraction of your take-home pay I think</text>
  <text start="1351.86" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s 15 percent of your take-home pay in</text>
  <text start="1353.72" dur="4.74">most states so that&amp;#39;s your that&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="1356.45" dur="3.57">risk alright if you have if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1358.46" dur="2.94">understand about banking and you got a</text>
  <text start="1360.02" dur="3.33">personal account you put cash in there</text>
  <text start="1361.4" dur="3.57">you can lose all of it if you have</text>
  <text start="1363.35" dur="2.82">unpaid student loans but if you</text>
  <text start="1364.97" dur="3.03">understand how to set up the account</text>
  <text start="1366.17" dur="4.74">properly you can protect yourself in</text>
  <text start="1368" dur="4.56">that sense so try to offset try to move</text>
  <text start="1370.91" dur="3.93">your guarantees suit alone on to an</text>
  <text start="1372.56" dur="4.71">unsecured payment so use your credit</text>
  <text start="1374.84" dur="4.35">card to pay it basically really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1377.27" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t try to bring family in to get a</text>
  <text start="1379.19" dur="3.09">student loan if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="1380.78" dur="3.27">situation right now where you think like</text>
  <text start="1382.28" dur="4.23">your parents think I&amp;#39;ll cosign for you</text>
  <text start="1384.05" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;m gonna suit a loan you&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="1386.51" dur="4.35">limiting your ability to get financing</text>
  <text start="1388.04" dur="5.01">by having parents cosign and you&amp;#39;re then</text>
  <text start="1390.86" dur="3.9">bringing a family member to co-sign on a</text>
  <text start="1393.05" dur="5.16">debt that&amp;#39;s gonna be really nasty later</text>
  <text start="1394.76" dur="4.83">on so don&amp;#39;t do that so if you if you</text>
  <text start="1398.21" dur="2.88">separate yourself from your parents do</text>
  <text start="1399.59" dur="3.69">not have your parents cosign you&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="1401.09" dur="4.53">way more options for financing for a</text>
  <text start="1403.28" dur="4.44">school if that&amp;#39;s what you want to do it</text>
  <text start="1405.62" dur="3.81">what do you think I don&amp;#39;t know if a</text>
  <text start="1407.72" dur="3.42">single millennial you know my generation</text>
  <text start="1409.43" dur="4.17">will watch this but I hope that they</text>
  <text start="1411.14" dur="4.32">will and for those who are watching that</text>
  <text start="1413.6" dur="4.02">you know may have guaranteed for their</text>
  <text start="1415.46" dur="4.62">children or grandchildren you know keep</text>
  <text start="1417.62" dur="3.69">that in mind going forward you know</text>
  <text start="1420.08" dur="2.31">obviously if you&amp;#39;ve already signed on</text>
  <text start="1421.31" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re not going to let you out of it</text>
  <text start="1422.39" dur="5.31">but what you can do is mitigate that by</text>
  <text start="1424.97" dur="4.47">becoming collection proof managing</text>
  <text start="1427.7" dur="3.09">property and cash outside of your name I</text>
  <text start="1429.44" dur="3.45">do this for investors all the time I do</text>
  <text start="1430.79" dur="4.35">i do reorganizations for small</text>
  <text start="1432.89" dur="3.96">businesses and investors and people just</text>
  <text start="1435.14" dur="3.72">with a job you know that they want to</text>
  <text start="1436.85" dur="4.26">get out of a situation the only thing</text>
  <text start="1438.86" dur="4.2">that it doesn&amp;#39;t really work for of</text>
  <text start="1441.11" dur="3.99">course is going to be collateral right</text>
  <text start="1443.06" dur="4.38">so if you had a mortgage what you do on</text>
  <text start="1445.1" dur="4.47">that situation is you or you shut down</text>
  <text start="1447.44" dur="4.08">the mortgage foreclosure process for a</text>
  <text start="1449.57" dur="4.86">period of time so that you can use the</text>
  <text start="1451.52" dur="5.07">property without paying you don&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="1454.43" dur="3.6">mortgage you don&amp;#39;t pay property taxes</text>
  <text start="1456.59" dur="3.96">and you don&amp;#39;t pay the insurance on it</text>
  <text start="1458.03" dur="3.84">until you get your money back until you</text>
  <text start="1460.55" dur="2.79">live there long enough to have recovered</text>
  <text start="1461.87" dur="4.87">your money which is usually takes about</text>
  <text start="1463.34" dur="4.51">two years Wow yeah then you</text>
  <text start="1466.74" dur="2.64">then you go off and find something else</text>
  <text start="1467.85" dur="3.57">and a lot of people at that point are</text>
  <text start="1469.38" dur="4.41">kind of lost because they think well I</text>
  <text start="1471.42" dur="3.87">have a foreclosure on my credit I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1473.79" dur="3.66">gonna be able to find a property and as</text>
  <text start="1475.29" dur="4.11">I show them how to do that and you&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="1477.45" dur="4.08">surprised it&amp;#39;s more difficult to get a</text>
  <text start="1479.4" dur="5.19">cell phone contract with bad credit than</text>
  <text start="1481.53" dur="4.32">it is to buy a house Wow are they kind</text>
  <text start="1484.59" dur="3.12">of desperate to move them one thing I</text>

  <text start="1642.15" dur="5.22">you know in my life that there was the</text>
  <text start="1644.46" dur="5.13">situation with the mentor who cheated me</text>
  <text start="1647.37" dur="4.29">on it and didn&amp;#39;t even give me all the K</text>
  <text start="1649.59" dur="4.2">ones and stuff I needed to do my taxes</text>
  <text start="1651.66" dur="4.11">and that was a I&amp;#39;m working with a guy</text>
  <text start="1653.79" dur="4.08">named Dan pilla tax help online for that</text>
  <text start="1655.77" dur="3.9">and then at one point I got ran over and</text>
  <text start="1657.87" dur="3.24">I was basically like in bed crippled</text>
  <text start="1659.67" dur="4.11">free here and I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything and</text>
  <text start="1661.11" dur="3.75">you know all my and all my debts just</text>
  <text start="1663.78" dur="4.08">counted up on me</text>
  <text start="1664.86" dur="4.53">so you know this can happen to the best</text>
  <text start="1667.86" dur="3.21">of people who really have the best</text>
  <text start="1669.39" dur="6.42">intentions to pay things back and</text>
  <text start="1671.07" dur="7.29">everything right um what I know you</text>
  <text start="1675.81" dur="4.71">mentioned a bunch of other really cool</text>
  <text start="1678.36" dur="4.62">things like you have your own car</text>
  <text start="1680.52" dur="3.63">insurance like things like that you want</text>
  <text start="1682.98" dur="3.45">to go into some of those things like</text>
  <text start="1684.15" dur="4.05">tricks of the trade yeah I didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1686.43" dur="4.23">some insurance company telling me what</text>
  <text start="1688.2" dur="3.72">to do instead and penalizing me if I got</text>
  <text start="1690.66" dur="3.57">into a wreck or something and I feel</text>
  <text start="1691.92" dur="3.96">like I&amp;#39;m a safe driver I think everybody</text>
  <text start="1694.23" dur="3.84">feels like he&amp;#39;s a safe driver right but</text>
  <text start="1695.88" dur="6.3">I don&amp;#39;t have any collision history I</text>
  <text start="1698.07" dur="6.45">mean almost nothing so I decided that I</text>
  <text start="1702.18" dur="4.41">would do some research this is 15 years</text>
  <text start="1704.52" dur="3.42">ago and figure out what the legal</text>
  <text start="1706.59" dur="3.15">requirements were to carry insurance</text>
  <text start="1707.94" dur="3.72">assuming that you know we&amp;#39;re even</text>
  <text start="1709.74" dur="3.99">required to buy insurance I don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="1711.66" dur="4.32">with that but hey it&amp;#39;s a statute okay</text>
  <text start="1713.73" dur="5.49">fine I&amp;#39;m not going to fight that part of</text>
  <text start="1715.98" dur="6.33">the system so I realized that I could</text>
  <text start="1719.22" dur="4.67">actually set up my own company fund it</text>
  <text start="1722.31" dur="3.75">now you don&amp;#39;t have to be rich to do this</text>
  <text start="1723.89" dur="3.46">you find your own company I happen to</text>
  <text start="1726.06" dur="4.23">fund it with precious metals because I</text>
  <text start="1727.35" dur="4.96">use those as leverage to do other things</text>
  <text start="1730.29" dur="4.24">so I actually use my insurance company</text>
  <text start="1732.31" dur="4.05">money I would love so I paid to my own</text>
  <text start="1734.53" dur="4.86">company and then every year I print up</text>
  <text start="1736.36" dur="6.21">insurance cards for my cars and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1739.39" dur="4.71">what we use to cover and what happens is</text>
  <text start="1742.57" dur="2.73">let&amp;#39;s say the cops stopped me for</text>
  <text start="1744.1" dur="2.31">speeding and they want my proof of</text>
  <text start="1745.3" dur="3.21">insurance and all this sort of thing</text>
  <text start="1746.41" dur="4.2">all the police want to see is proof of</text>
  <text start="1748.51" dur="4.23">financial responsibility and for them</text>
  <text start="1750.61" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s just a card that shows what the</text>
  <text start="1752.74" dur="3.51">coverage is and who&amp;#39;s covered and when</text>
  <text start="1755.08" dur="3.48">it expires that&amp;#39;s all they care about</text>
  <text start="1756.25" dur="3.83">once you had that you&amp;#39;re good so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1758.56" dur="5.04">say if I get into a wreck or something</text>
  <text start="1760.08" dur="4.99">it&amp;#39;s my company right so hopefully I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1763.6" dur="3.03">betting on myself and it&amp;#39;s a good bet</text>
  <text start="1765.07" dur="3.72">and the other person&amp;#39;s gonna be liable</text>
  <text start="1766.63" dur="4.41">and have to pay through his insurance</text>
  <text start="1768.79" dur="3.87">and hopefully he&amp;#39;s covered it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1771.04" dur="2.58">cover me for catastrophic if I want to</text>
  <text start="1772.66" dur="2.37">do that I have to give a different</text>
  <text start="1773.62" dur="4.05">policy and I would get a real policy</text>
  <text start="1775.03" dur="4.17">that way it&amp;#39;s reinsured but this one is</text>
  <text start="1777.67" dur="3.63">not even reinsured it&amp;#39;s my own company</text>
  <text start="1779.2" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s what would be called a captive</text>
  <text start="1781.3" dur="4.23">insurance if anybody wants to research</text>
  <text start="1783.37" dur="3.42">it but captive insurance is really a</text>
  <text start="1785.53" dur="3.27">different animal than what I&amp;#39;m using</text>
  <text start="1786.79" dur="3.99">this is the best way to describe what</text>
  <text start="1788.8" dur="3.54">I&amp;#39;m doing though yeah I just carry my</text>
  <text start="1790.78" dur="4.08">own insurance I&amp;#39;m it&amp;#39;s helped me in some</text>
  <text start="1792.34" dur="4.98">situations where I mean if I got one</text>
  <text start="1794.86" dur="4.38">time I backed into a guy and I was gonna</text>
  <text start="1797.32" dur="3.12">split the cost with them because he was</text>
  <text start="1799.24" dur="3.15">at fault also it was a weird situation</text>
  <text start="1800.44" dur="3.3">and I was gonna split it with him and</text>
  <text start="1802.39" dur="3.54">know he had to bring in his insurance</text>
  <text start="1803.74" dur="3.36">company and make a police report and I</text>
  <text start="1805.93" dur="4.11">said fine you know if you want to do</text>
  <text start="1807.1" dur="5.12">that my offer ends now I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="1810.04" dur="3.66">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s my I&amp;#39;m pulling my</text>
  <text start="1812.22" dur="5.05">redacting my offer</text>
  <text start="1813.7" dur="5.46">and so basically he had to pay it and I</text>
  <text start="1817.27" dur="3.81">have the power to do that because I make</text>
  <text start="1819.16" dur="4.95">the rules you know in my own insurance</text>
  <text start="1821.08" dur="4.53">company it&amp;#39;s so cool yeah and if you</text>
  <text start="1824.11" dur="3.81">want to see my insurance company</text>
  <text start="1825.61" dur="5.49">maybe I&amp;#39;ll just dissolve it instead of a</text>
  <text start="1827.92" dur="6.48">new one yeah is that difficult to do</text>
  <text start="1831.1" dur="4.86">no it takes me about an hour well I mean</text>
  <text start="1834.4" dur="3.27">setting up the whole insurance to know</text>
  <text start="1835.96" dur="3.57">that I can set up the whole thing I mean</text>
  <text start="1837.67" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s a plan so you have to understand</text>
  <text start="1839.53" dur="3.96">what you&amp;#39;re doing that took me a few</text>
  <text start="1841.66" dur="3.12">weeks to actually plan it out and how</text>
  <text start="1843.49" dur="3">I&amp;#39;m gonna manage the balance sheet</text>
  <text start="1844.78" dur="3.21">because a company is just a piece of</text>
  <text start="1846.49" dur="3.48">paper so you want to have something</text>
  <text start="1847.99" dur="3.48">behind it right so I actually have a</text>
  <text start="1849.97" dur="4.26">balance sheet like here&amp;#39;s an example I</text>
  <text start="1851.47" dur="5.13">took my insurance company I took because</text>
  <text start="1854.23" dur="5.28">precious metals did well at some point</text>
  <text start="1856.6" dur="5.88">like 2008 or something I took a little</text>
  <text start="1859.51" dur="4.98">windfall out of my holdings and I bought</text>
  <text start="1862.48" dur="3.43">literally I bought a fleet of cars in</text>
  <text start="1864.49" dur="4.06">Europe</text>
  <text start="1865.91" dur="5.07">I bought a bunch of BMWs Mercedes were</text>
  <text start="1868.55" dur="3.69">knows a bunch of cars okay now I have</text>
  <text start="1870.98" dur="3.33">friends over there that did something</text>
  <text start="1872.24" dur="4.17">for me so I bought them through a dealer</text>
  <text start="1874.31" dur="3.66">in Europe I took my whole family on</text>
  <text start="1876.41" dur="3.33">vacation we went there of nine people</text>
  <text start="1877.97" dur="3.78">who went there for two months in Europe</text>
  <text start="1879.74" dur="3.99">we drove the cars all over the place and</text>
  <text start="1881.75" dur="3.81">we drove two or three of the cars the</text>
  <text start="1883.73" dur="5.82">rest of the cars were being sold by my</text>
  <text start="1885.56" dur="5.76">friend&amp;#39;s dealer who he has a lot so he</text>
  <text start="1889.55" dur="3.78">sold the cars and as he sold them he</text>
  <text start="1891.32" dur="4.17">went and bought more so they turned over</text>
  <text start="1893.33" dur="3.54">the cars a bunch of times and by the</text>
  <text start="1895.49" dur="3.09">time we finished our vacation we had</text>
  <text start="1896.87" dur="2.58">made our money back and when I went back</text>
  <text start="1898.58" dur="3.78">to the States</text>
  <text start="1899.45" dur="5.22">I went and replenished my funds and this</text>
  <text start="1902.36" dur="5.25">is as usual and had a free free vacation</text>
  <text start="1904.67" dur="4.17">in Europe for two months Wow that&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1907.61" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s just an example I mean that&amp;#39;s to</text>
  <text start="1908.84" dur="4.2">cover a living expense but you can also</text>
  <text start="1911.3" dur="3.6">do it for leverage you can you can buy</text>
  <text start="1913.04" dur="4.08">to an asset for it you know with it if</text>
  <text start="1914.9" dur="4.53">you want you can use it for whatever I</text>
  <text start="1917.12" dur="3.6">would love to learn like leveraging I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1919.43" dur="3.3">always wondered like how can you</text>
  <text start="1920.72" dur="4.08">leverage these rocks that have metal</text>
  <text start="1922.73" dur="5.22">that I just can&amp;#39;t do anything with like</text>
  <text start="1924.8" dur="5.28">except wait yeah you that I probably</text>
  <text start="1927.95" dur="3.66">wouldn&amp;#39;t go with a bank I mean they</text>
  <text start="1930.08" dur="3.69">probably come up with a way to steal it</text>
  <text start="1931.61" dur="3.87">you know but yeah you could I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="1933.77" dur="4.14">done it that way before normally what I</text>
  <text start="1935.48" dur="3.51">do is a joint venture like when I when I</text>
  <text start="1937.91" dur="3.36">get a person out of this debt situation</text>
  <text start="1938.99" dur="4.71">like you know I set up his business or I</text>
  <text start="1941.27" dur="4.98">get him on his personal debt stop is</text>
  <text start="1943.7" dur="5.01">foreclosure a lot of times people are</text>
  <text start="1946.25" dur="4.47">open to the idea of wanting to make more</text>
  <text start="1948.71" dur="3.75">money like some people don&amp;#39;t care they</text>
  <text start="1950.72" dur="2.82">just want to focus on their job and but</text>

  <text start="1956.12" dur="6.57">money and I specialize in bootstrapping</text>
  <text start="1959.17" dur="4.78">bootstrapping that is right just talking</text>

  <text start="1978.44" dur="3.09">in the front this guy&amp;#39;s yard and on the</text>
  <text start="1979.88" dur="2.97">back it has this little sign in there</text>
  <text start="1981.53" dur="3.75">that he&amp;#39;s has a long maintenance</text>
  <text start="1982.85" dur="3.57">business so I thought it&amp;#39;d be so easy to</text>
  <text start="1985.28" dur="3.03">go over there and I didn&amp;#39;t do this but</text>
  <text start="1986.42" dur="3.72">this is an example of how it works you</text>
  <text start="1988.31" dur="4.62">go knock on the door talk to the guy and</text>
  <text start="1990.14" dur="4.26">say hey um would you like to expand can</text>
  <text start="1992.93" dur="3.51">I bring you some more contracts can you</text>
  <text start="1994.4" dur="2.46">handle some more contracts and if you</text>
  <text start="1996.44" dur="2.22">can&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1999.47" dur="3.75">your business right this is a real</text>
  <text start="2000.97" dur="3.959">conversation you can do so what I would</text>
  <text start="2003.22" dur="3.48">do is I would go market his lawn</text>
  <text start="2004.929" dur="3.511">maintenance company through whatever</text>
  <text start="2006.7" dur="3.99">knowledge I have and that cost me a</text>
  <text start="2008.44" dur="3.21">little bit of money in time okay so what</text>
  <text start="2010.69" dur="2.43">I would do is not buy a standard</text>
  <text start="2011.65" dur="3.36">contract that I would get him to approve</text>
  <text start="2013.12" dur="4.049">and what I would do is sell the contract</text>
  <text start="2015.01" dur="3.72">to a customer and have him sign the</text>
  <text start="2017.169" dur="3.151">contract for let&amp;#39;s say a year or nine</text>
  <text start="2018.73" dur="4.17">months and then I would sell the</text>
  <text start="2020.32" dur="4.8">contract at a discount rate to the guy I</text>
  <text start="2022.9" dur="5.94">talked to the owner of the company so I</text>
  <text start="2025.12" dur="6.09">would take my cut upfront very cool or</text>
  <text start="2028.84" dur="4.02">on the back end or whatever so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2031.21" dur="3.42">an example of how you can like work with</text>
  <text start="2032.86" dur="3.6">a neighbor who might have his lawn truck</text>
  <text start="2034.63" dur="3.84">in your neighborhood and you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="2036.46" dur="4.11">because you know the guy you can do that</text>

  <text start="2198.07" dur="3.84">of the things I just came out with is a</text>
  <text start="2199.69" dur="5.3">little single board computer it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="2201.91" dur="5.73">maybe as big as palm of your hand and</text>
  <text start="2204.99" dur="4.09">you plug it into your monitor so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2207.64" dur="3.54">its own computer it&amp;#39;s its own desktop</text>
  <text start="2209.08" dur="5.58">the operating system is encrypted and</text>
  <text start="2211.18" dur="6.18">you can access all your your crypto</text>
  <text start="2214.66" dur="5.58">wallets online and when you&amp;#39;re done just</text>
  <text start="2217.36" dur="4.38">unplug it and it goes in your vault so</text>
  <text start="2220.24" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s a cold storage but it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="2221.74" dur="4.53">smart device and if anything happens to</text>
  <text start="2223.93" dur="4.44">it if it&amp;#39;s destroyed it&amp;#39;s your access to</text>
  <text start="2226.27" dur="4.83">those wallets that&amp;#39;s destroyed so you</text>

  <text start="2238.54" dur="4.35">handle yourself like you create that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2240.46" dur="4.68">producer yeah I I supply it right I</text>
  <text start="2242.89" dur="4.92">supply it I customize the desktop and</text>
  <text start="2245.14" dur="5.4">then ship it out and then people use it</text>
  <text start="2247.81" dur="4.38">for Kryptos microcomputers like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2250.54" dur="3.15">heard of the Raspberry Pi things like</text>
  <text start="2252.19" dur="3.3">that that&amp;#39;s fascinating stuff that is</text>
  <text start="2253.69" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s much like that yeah those things</text>
  <text start="2255.49" dur="3.42">are stronger now than the expensive</text>
  <text start="2257.38" dur="3.72">desktops I started playing video games</text>
  <text start="2258.91" dur="4.44">on as a kid oh yeah they are I know they</text>
  <text start="2261.1" dur="3.72">are pretty good yeah but this is perfect</text>
  <text start="2263.35" dur="2.759">for kryptos and it&amp;#39;s a little bit a</text>
  <text start="2264.82" dur="3.209">little bit better than the ledge</text>
  <text start="2266.109" dur="4.051">blue which is the most advanced ledger</text>
  <text start="2268.029" dur="4.56">because it&amp;#39;s actually a whole computer</text>
  <text start="2270.16" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s a whole desktop you know the dark</text>
  <text start="2272.589" dur="3.69">web with it which is not my niche right</text>
  <text start="2274.42" dur="4.71">now when my niche is the cryptos is</text>
  <text start="2276.279" dur="6.661">there like here&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m really worried</text>
  <text start="2279.13" dur="5.399">about you know hacking and viruses that</text>
  <text start="2282.94" dur="3.329">I can&amp;#39;t like keyloggers things that I</text>
  <text start="2284.529" dur="3.78">don&amp;#39;t know necessarily how to trace like</text>
  <text start="2286.269" dur="4.381">I&amp;#39;ve played video games through my teens</text>
  <text start="2288.309" dur="3.81">I can stop most viruses but in the age</text>
  <text start="2290.65" dur="3.419">of crypto is like how do you protect</text>
  <text start="2292.119" dur="5.22">yourself well use a virtual private</text>
  <text start="2294.069" dur="5.311">network number one and just don&amp;#39;t go to</text>
  <text start="2297.339" dur="4.081">all kinds of websites and download all</text>
  <text start="2299.38" dur="5.28">kinds of software on a computer that you</text>
  <text start="2301.42" dur="4.829">care about okay I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2304.66" dur="3.419">those are the two big things right there</text>
  <text start="2306.249" dur="4.141">I mean of course you can do the</text>
  <text start="2308.079" dur="4.02">best-equipped did use there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="2310.39" dur="4.379">operating systems like on my computer</text>
  <text start="2312.099" dur="6.631">right now the one that I&amp;#39;m using is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2314.769" dur="5.22">using Linux so I just had I have a</text>
  <text start="2318.73" dur="3.359">computer guy that does this for me so</text>
  <text start="2319.989" dur="4.05">what I was using Windows before that so</text>
  <text start="2322.089" dur="4.44">I didn&amp;#39;t want to it kept trying to force</text>
  <text start="2324.039" dur="3.871">me to Windows 10 and I shut that down</text>
  <text start="2326.529" dur="3.121">but that was like you know I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2327.91" dur="5.399">want to have Windows anymore I get just</text>
  <text start="2329.65" dur="5.159">annoying witness it&amp;#39;s a virus so I took</text>
  <text start="2333.309" dur="3.54">into my computer guy said give her to my</text>
  <text start="2334.809" dur="7.47">hard drive give me a solid state hard</text>
  <text start="2336.849" dur="6.841">drive and install was Linux okay so he</text>
  <text start="2342.279" dur="4.381">did all that for me now my hard drive</text>
  <text start="2343.69" dur="4.98">Isis fast and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all encrypted</text>
  <text start="2346.66" dur="3.81">not my desktop is encrypted is it</text>
  <text start="2348.67" dur="3.72">difficult to get into those like I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2350.47" dur="3.72">never got into Ubuntu and Linux and</text>
  <text start="2352.39" dur="4.05">stuff no works just like Windows I mean</text>
  <text start="2354.19" dur="4.139">there&amp;#39;s a couple nuances some of the</text>
  <text start="2356.44" dur="4.98">drivers are different so it just takes a</text>
  <text start="2358.329" dur="4.47">little time I mean I don&amp;#39;t like to get</text>
  <text start="2361.42" dur="3.389">into all the technical stuff that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="2362.799" dur="5.431">I have other people do it for me it was</text>
  <text start="2364.809" dur="5.641">easy for me to do it I&amp;#39;m gonna start</text>
  <text start="2368.23" dur="4.019">considering that then for myself that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2370.45" dur="4.02">very interesting yeah and the other</text>
  <text start="2372.249" dur="3.33">thing on this some when people you know</text>
  <text start="2374.47" dur="2.309">when people use coinbase and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2375.579" dur="3.361">kind of stuck because of the user</text>
  <text start="2376.779" dur="4.111">friendliness of it right so their</text>
  <text start="2378.94" dur="3.359">concern is taxes so a lot of the</text>
  <text start="2380.89" dur="3.33">questions I&amp;#39;ve been getting lately and I</text>
  <text start="2382.299" dur="4.71">set up accounts for people on this as I</text>
  <text start="2384.22" dur="5.519">set up a bank account it&amp;#39;s tax deferred</text>
  <text start="2387.009" dur="5.161">and then I make it so that when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2389.739" dur="4.681">trading the Kryptos let&amp;#39;s assume there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2392.17" dur="4.439">a gain from Bitcoin to litecoin let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2394.42" dur="5.49">say made a game right well I made it so</text>
  <text start="2396.609" dur="6.96">that in the in the account I&amp;#39;m setting</text>
  <text start="2399.91" dur="6.03">a trust is created because you&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="2403.569" dur="3.99">coinbase for example the trust is based</text>
  <text start="2405.94" dur="2.609">on the fact that using coin mates when</text>
  <text start="2407.559" dur="3.721">you&amp;#39;re not using coinbase</text>
  <text start="2408.549" dur="4.921">the trust doesn&amp;#39;t come into play so I</text>
  <text start="2411.28" dur="5.4">created a blockchain trust I called a</text>
  <text start="2413.47" dur="6.27">blockchain tax and unity trust I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2416.68" dur="6.06">running that yeah that trust goes inside</text>
  <text start="2419.74" dur="4.859">the operating agreement for that for the</text>
  <text start="2422.74" dur="4.23">account holder the account holder is a</text>
  <text start="2424.599" dur="5.101">company so now you get tax deferment</text>
  <text start="2426.97" dur="5.069">it&amp;#39;s a pass through and you get tax</text>
  <text start="2429.7" dur="4.379">immunity because of the way the trust is</text>
  <text start="2432.039" dur="4.861">structured in fact the trust is</text>
  <text start="2434.079" dur="5.901">recognized in the tax code as a thing</text>
  <text start="2436.9" dur="5.73">that can&amp;#39;t be taxed ironically yeah</text>
  <text start="2439.98" dur="4.03">that&amp;#39;s really cool but here in a certain</text>
  <text start="2442.63" dur="3.75">way it can&amp;#39;t be taxed</text>
  <text start="2444.01" dur="4.349">that&amp;#39;s very cool if using coinbase I</text>
  <text start="2446.38" dur="6.63">like to use like local bitcoins or</text>
  <text start="2448.359" dur="6.421">something more but what um you know you</text>
  <text start="2453.01" dur="3.75">mentioned VPN do you have a favorite</text>
  <text start="2454.78" dur="3.9">like I used Nord VPN because it&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="2456.76" dur="3.51">Panama it is actually I like that the</text>
  <text start="2458.68" dur="3.78">best okay perfect</text>
  <text start="2460.27" dur="4.11">no I&amp;#39;m not a complete fool on this all</text>
  <text start="2462.46" dur="3.72">right good ones I mean you can check</text>
  <text start="2464.38" dur="3.09">them out I mean I&amp;#39;m a layman when it</text>
  <text start="2466.18" dur="4.139">comes to figuring out which is the best</text>
  <text start="2467.47" dur="4.68">I gauge it on the privacy policy of the</text>
  <text start="2470.319" dur="3.901">company mm-hmm tell you a little bit</text>
  <text start="2472.15" dur="3.75">about you yeah and you want to pay</text>
  <text start="2474.22" dur="3.569">something like you don&amp;#39;t want to be free</text>
  <text start="2475.9" dur="3.75">but you probably wanna pay three to five</text>
  <text start="2477.789" dur="3.121">dollars a month if you&amp;#39;re paying fifteen</text>
  <text start="2479.65" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s probably overpriced</text>
  <text start="2480.91" dur="4.949">I am I do use it as an affiliate too so</text>
  <text start="2484" dur="3.39">people someone buys it I get a couple</text>
  <text start="2485.859" dur="3.45">bucks but it was a business account or</text>
  <text start="2487.39" dur="3.479">something yeah but I think Nord has one</text>
  <text start="2489.309" dur="4.831">for like five bucks a month I need to</text>
  <text start="2490.869" dur="4.861">look into that and but yeah that is cool</text>
  <text start="2494.14" dur="2.939">have we missed any of like the big</text>
  <text start="2495.73" dur="4.29">things I know you talked about like</text>
  <text start="2497.079" dur="4.801">spying a new technology like Wi-Fi and</text>
  <text start="2500.02" dur="4.019">smart or not Wi-Fi bit like smart meters</text>
  <text start="2501.88" dur="4.709">and cellphones and all of these house</text>
  <text start="2504.039" dur="4.681">appliances that are smart do you have a</text>
  <text start="2506.589" dur="4.23">way to block those well there&amp;#39;s a couple</text>
  <text start="2508.72" dur="4.559">things on that yeah what I do is okay on</text>
  <text start="2510.819" dur="4.26">my on my router I changed this over the</text>
  <text start="2513.279" dur="3.631">year this last year I started really</text>
  <text start="2515.079" dur="2.76">getting it over the year on the router</text>
  <text start="2516.91" dur="5.82">okay</text>
  <text start="2517.839" dur="7.23">I went from Wi-Fi to Wired so I&amp;#39;m using</text>
  <text start="2522.73" dur="3.599">ether cable connected to the Internet so</text>
  <text start="2525.069" dur="3.03">you have to wire the cable it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="2526.329" dur="3.121">bit inconvenient but you don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="2528.099" dur="3.571">broadcast as signal and you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2529.45" dur="4.02">all the EMF radiation in your house it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2531.67" dur="5.1">actually like running a microwave</text>
  <text start="2533.47" dur="9.45">your whole house have you have you heard</text>
  <text start="2536.77" dur="8.099">of shunga yeah that I get I got this as</text>
  <text start="2542.92" dur="3.689">like a gift oh yeah okay</text>
  <text start="2544.869" dur="3.931">they have these these different rocks I</text>
  <text start="2546.609" dur="3.331">wear a necklace it&amp;#39;s on the phone little</text>
  <text start="2548.8" dur="4.77">thing you can put on the phone with a</text>
  <text start="2549.94" dur="5.52">sticky and apparently it&amp;#39;s a rock but it</text>
  <text start="2553.57" dur="3.69">has this weird effect and you can go</text>
  <text start="2555.46" dur="3.99">like do a quick youtube search where</text>
  <text start="2557.26" dur="4.349">they use smart meter or EMF detectors</text>
  <text start="2559.45" dur="3.659">and stuff right waves and you put it</text>
  <text start="2561.609" dur="3.961">between the microwave and the detector</text>
  <text start="2563.109" dur="4.771">and it goes from PPP to nothing okay</text>
  <text start="2565.57" dur="3.779">this stuff attenuates this stuff and it</text>
  <text start="2567.88" dur="3.09">makes the EMF I guess just less</text>
  <text start="2569.349" dur="3.541">dangerous like it signals that whatever</text>
  <text start="2570.97" dur="3.81">thing yeah you should have that what I</text>
  <text start="2572.89" dur="5.31">what I did is called shun kite right</text>
  <text start="2574.78" dur="6">yeah so okay so in lieu of that what I</text>
  <text start="2578.2" dur="4.26">did is I got a cardboard box and I put a</text>
  <text start="2580.78" dur="3.06">metal you know the screens you have to</text>
  <text start="2582.46" dur="3.45">replace the screens in your house they</text>
  <text start="2583.84" dur="4.5">get torn so I just got a roll of that at</text>
  <text start="2585.91" dur="4.74">Home Depot and I cut out a rectangular</text>
  <text start="2588.34" dur="5.4">piece and I put it in the box and I put</text>
  <text start="2590.65" dur="5.07">my my router in that box under the TV in</text>
  <text start="2593.74" dur="4.71">the living room so that attenuates this</text>
  <text start="2595.72" dur="5.19">thing a little bit but if I&amp;#39;m on the</text>
  <text start="2598.45" dur="4.409">ether there&amp;#39;s no signal right and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2600.91" dur="5.01">insulated like ether six is your best</text>
  <text start="2602.859" dur="5.281">ether cable okay so that&amp;#39;s one thing so</text>
  <text start="2605.92" dur="4.02">my one of my concerns is EMF and the</text>
  <text start="2608.14" dur="2.91">other one is privacy so I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2609.94" dur="4.38">someone sitting out in front of my house</text>
  <text start="2611.05" dur="4.799">grabbing my signal so I have I want to</text>
  <text start="2614.32" dur="3.06">share an idea with you that I think I</text>
  <text start="2615.849" dur="3.691">came up with this I was the first so</text>
  <text start="2617.38" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s very exciting that it&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="2619.54" dur="3.569">invention because it&amp;#39;s I didn&amp;#39;t create</text>
  <text start="2621.339" dur="4.02">some guy but just like you were talking</text>
  <text start="2623.109" dur="3.811">about with that screen I was gonna take</text>
  <text start="2625.359" dur="3.631">just a piece of cardboard box like a</text>
  <text start="2626.92" dur="4.38">flattened large box like a furniture box</text>
  <text start="2628.99" dur="4.26">or something and and mix a little bit of</text>
  <text start="2631.3" dur="3.66">this ground-up shunga powder that you</text>
  <text start="2633.25" dur="3.81">can get real cheap and some Elmer&amp;#39;s glue</text>
  <text start="2634.96" dur="3.78">and there&amp;#39;s sandwich it in there put</text>
  <text start="2637.06" dur="3.72">that up on the wall right near my smart</text>
  <text start="2638.74" dur="4.05">meter and then cover it with something</text>
  <text start="2640.78" dur="3.51">like artistic it sounds like a lot of</text>
  <text start="2642.79" dur="4.14">work I mean I would test it to make sure</text>
  <text start="2644.29" dur="3.87">what I yeah I need to get I need to be</text>
  <text start="2646.93" dur="2.55">able to buy one of the little meters to</text>
  <text start="2648.16" dur="4.14">test it because I&amp;#39;m not sure about the</text>
  <text start="2649.48" dur="4.77">powder versus the full stone but what I</text>
  <text start="2652.3" dur="3.51">did is I bought like 20 bucks worth of</text>
  <text start="2654.25" dur="3.81">the powder and I mixed it with my paint</text>
  <text start="2655.81" dur="4.77">and I just painted my house so the work</text>
  <text start="2658.06" dur="4.5">as far as I know it has I haven&amp;#39;t gotten</text>
  <text start="2660.58" dur="4.56">a little neater to test it every single</text>
  <text start="2662.56" dur="4.25">video every single report on jean-guy</text>
  <text start="2665.14" dur="3.26">is is very positive in this</text>
  <text start="2666.81" dur="4.35">so if the powder works just like the</text>
  <text start="2668.4" dur="4.5">full-size stone okay you&amp;#39;re able to get</text>
  <text start="2671.16" dur="4.65">full protection from your entire house</text>
  <text start="2672.9" dur="4.38">yeah the UV windows treatments and then</text>
  <text start="2675.81" dur="4.35">use this and you have everything covered</text>
  <text start="2677.28" dur="5.85">that&amp;#39;ll work well okay so so I did that</text>
  <text start="2680.16" dur="6.15">for the modem for the router and then I</text>
  <text start="2683.13" dur="5.43">took the same screen and I cut an 18</text>
  <text start="2686.31" dur="4.32">inch by 18 inch square and I got a hose</text>
  <text start="2688.56" dur="3.96">clamp and I just put it over the face of</text>
  <text start="2690.63" dur="3.81">my smart meter and just slid it over</text>
  <text start="2692.52" dur="3.54">with the hose clamp and then clamped it</text>
  <text start="2694.44" dur="3.54">down and I got my neighbor to do it cuz</text>
  <text start="2696.06" dur="2.91">his meter was right behind mine so I</text>
  <text start="2697.98" dur="3.24">just went over to him he was in his</text>
  <text start="2698.97" dur="4.59">garage and I said hey because ya do it</text>
  <text start="2701.22" dur="4.05">so I put one on his so well that does is</text>
  <text start="2703.56" dur="4.08">kill the signal but the meter still</text>
  <text start="2705.27" dur="4.05">operates so I don&amp;#39;t know if it cuts off</text>
  <text start="2707.64" dur="6.21">the data flow but it does cut off the</text>
  <text start="2709.32" dur="6.77">EMF okay he wrote you that&amp;#39;s your router</text>
  <text start="2713.85" dur="5.22">you cut off your smart meter and then</text>
  <text start="2716.09" dur="5.83">like here&amp;#39;s what I did okay we had 5g</text>
  <text start="2719.07" dur="7.35">phones iPhones so I went back to 3G I</text>
  <text start="2721.92" dur="5.97">got a brand new Nokia 3310 they make</text>
  <text start="2726.42" dur="4.47">them brand new you don&amp;#39;t have to buy</text>
  <text start="2727.89" dur="5.22">used one so it has less it&amp;#39;s still a</text>
  <text start="2730.89" dur="4.53">smart phone but it has less radiation</text>
  <text start="2733.11" dur="4.68">and then when I&amp;#39;m not using it I turn it</text>
  <text start="2735.42" dur="4.74">off and I keep it in a tinfoil shoebox</text>
  <text start="2737.79" dur="4.71">in the microwave and I only use my</text>
  <text start="2740.16" dur="3.78">microwave as a Faraday cage I don&amp;#39;t ever</text>
  <text start="2742.5" dur="5.25">use it to cook anything ever and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2743.94" dur="6.12">not yeah that&amp;#39;s all I use it for so</text>
  <text start="2747.75" dur="4.56">those are the few things you know I mean</text>
  <text start="2750.06" dur="4.2">you could go far out and you can even</text>
  <text start="2752.31" dur="4.5">get drapes for your house and blinds</text>
  <text start="2754.26" dur="5.46">that are made of silver and you know you</text>
  <text start="2756.81" dur="4.62">know they&amp;#39;re just using those those UV</text>
  <text start="2759.72" dur="3.9">treatments for the windows the plastic</text>
  <text start="2761.43" dur="5.37">film you know I got good things about</text>
  <text start="2763.62" dur="3.45">that blocks at 100% yeah that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="2766.8" dur="1.8">cool</text>
  <text start="2767.07" dur="3.62">yeah and turn off things at night you</text>
  <text start="2768.6" dur="3.99">know don&amp;#39;t keep your router on at night</text>
  <text start="2770.69" dur="2.8">don&amp;#39;t keep electronics in your room</text>
  <text start="2772.59" dur="2.07">shouldn&amp;#39;t have a TV in your room</text>
  <text start="2773.49" dur="4.05">shouldn&amp;#39;t have your phone in your room</text>
  <text start="2774.66" dur="5.01">tablets iPads that stuff cooks you and</text>
  <text start="2777.54" dur="3.75">spies on you you know another thing is</text>
  <text start="2779.67" dur="3.78">because okay so I got two of these I got</text>
  <text start="2781.29" dur="5.01">one for the car okay so it has a</text>
  <text start="2783.45" dur="4.89">stripped out contact list all that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="2786.3" dur="5.31">there is triple-a and my other two</text>
  <text start="2788.34" dur="4.8">phones so I leave this phone here and</text>
  <text start="2791.61" dur="3.12">then if I need to call you know</text>
  <text start="2793.14" dur="3">obviously I got it&amp;#39;s in the glove box I</text>
  <text start="2794.73" dur="3.3">was going to charge it but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2796.14" dur="3.39">lose the charge easily especially if you</text>
  <text start="2798.03" dur="2.98">have an insulated while you&amp;#39;re driving</text>
  <text start="2799.53" dur="4.42">cuz when you&amp;#39;re driving</text>
  <text start="2801.01" dur="4.56">the signal is being called by all the in</text>
  <text start="2803.95" dur="3.47">at the intersections there are router</text>
  <text start="2805.57" dur="4.08">boxes that are calling your phone and</text>
  <text start="2807.42" dur="3.34">they&amp;#39;re able to grab your data as you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2809.65" dur="2.82">driving down the street it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2810.76" dur="3.09">calling calling calling calling so if</text>
  <text start="2812.47" dur="2.79">you leave your phone in your car in the</text>
  <text start="2813.85" dur="3.33">glovebox and you want to use it sometime</text>
  <text start="2815.26" dur="4.11">and you don&amp;#39;t charge it that much it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2817.18" dur="4.02">be dead because it&amp;#39;s always being called</text>
  <text start="2819.37" dur="3.99">or it&amp;#39;s always trying to reach a tower</text>
  <text start="2821.2" dur="4.38">so if you insulate it with like aluminum</text>
  <text start="2823.36" dur="4.59">foil or a screen or one of these EMF</text>
  <text start="2825.58" dur="3.87">shields you can by then it won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2827.95" dur="3.74">calling every time and they&amp;#39;ll preserve</text>
  <text start="2829.45" dur="5.1">the battery it&amp;#39;s fascinating</text>
  <text start="2831.69" dur="5.44">yeah have you heard about some of these</text>
  <text start="2834.55" dur="4.74">new attempts like in the crypto world</text>
  <text start="2837.13" dur="3.57">the one that comes to mind is sky coin</text>
  <text start="2839.29" dur="3.24">but there&amp;#39;s multiple ones where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2840.7" dur="4.62">trying to decentralize the internet make</text>
  <text start="2842.53" dur="5.28">you make your you your own ISP provider</text>
  <text start="2845.32" dur="3.78">yeah that&amp;#39;s coming that&amp;#39;s coming and you</text>
  <text start="2847.81" dur="2.72">can even do it as a business you can</text>
  <text start="2849.1" dur="3.57">even set up what&amp;#39;s called a mesh net</text>
  <text start="2850.53" dur="3.67">yeah you really should I mean it</text>
  <text start="2852.67" dur="3.06">wouldn&amp;#39;t take much and you could sell it</text>
  <text start="2854.2" dur="3.75">to your neighbors and they could pay way</text>
  <text start="2855.73" dur="4.5">less for internet and have all the I</text>
  <text start="2857.95" dur="4.29">live like in a small community that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2860.23" dur="3.75">pretty close but not quite it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2862.24" dur="4.47">cost them like 12 13 grand to get the</text>
  <text start="2863.98" dur="4.35">fiber up the hill not too far okay I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2866.71" dur="4.26">rather just tell them wait just a little</text>
  <text start="2868.33" dur="7.08">bit longer and usually well you could do</text>
  <text start="2870.97" dur="5.43">it with with telescoping uh dishes you</text>
  <text start="2875.41" dur="3.66">can have a couple satellite dishes</text>
  <text start="2876.4" dur="3.87">basically you can broadcast a signal to</text>
  <text start="2879.07" dur="3.87">where you need to you don&amp;#39;t have to run</text>
  <text start="2880.27" dur="4.44">the cable up so if you had a mesh net</text>
  <text start="2882.94" dur="4.05">you can actually hook it on like you can</text>
  <text start="2884.71" dur="3.93">even you need a dish you can put a film</text>
  <text start="2886.99" dur="3.66">in your window and you can broadcast</text>
  <text start="2888.64" dur="3.45">your internet signal and relay it and</text>
  <text start="2890.65" dur="3.84">you can have internet just from a film</text>
  <text start="2892.09" dur="3.6">in your window and everybody has one and</text>
  <text start="2894.49" dur="3.15">the whole signals going in your</text>
  <text start="2895.69" dur="4.08">neighborhood like this and then exits</text>
  <text start="2897.64" dur="3.93">your neighborhood into the into the</text>
  <text start="2899.77" dur="5.19">regular internet through the trunk lines</text>
  <text start="2901.57" dur="4.74">through your set up you know you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2904.96" dur="3.21">even need to have them connected if</text>
  <text start="2906.31" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s gonna cost you it</text>
  <text start="2908.17" dur="3.54">would cost you $3,000 to convert your</text>
  <text start="2910" dur="3.84">neighborhood and all you need is one</text>
  <text start="2911.71" dur="4.02">location that&amp;#39;s gonna handle the hub and</text>
  <text start="2913.84" dur="4.41">then everybody else just put something</text>
  <text start="2915.73" dur="3.99">to receive the signal and you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="2918.25" dur="2.91">yourself a mesh net what kind of like</text>
  <text start="2919.72" dur="4.08">reach with this half because I&amp;#39;m about</text>
  <text start="2921.16" dur="5.91">four or five miles from them here and I</text>
  <text start="2923.8" dur="4.86">have 50/50 speed you can as long as you</text>
  <text start="2927.07" dur="3.33">have the connection you&amp;#39;re broadcasting</text>
  <text start="2928.66" dur="3.9">the signal line of sight</text>
  <text start="2930.4" dur="4.47">you just have to broadcast of line of</text>
  <text start="2932.56" dur="5.07">sight so it&amp;#39;s a relay</text>
  <text start="2934.87" dur="5.61">from node to node from a house to house</text>
  <text start="2937.63" dur="5.04">yeah so you can broadcast as far as you</text>
  <text start="2940.48" dur="2.61">want you can go a thousand houses or 50</text>
  <text start="2942.67" dur="4.26">houses</text>
  <text start="2943.09" dur="5.84">what if okay so most of them are about</text>
  <text start="2946.93" dur="5.09">five miles away and I&amp;#39;m still in town</text>
  <text start="2948.93" dur="5.77">there is there a way to bridge that gap</text>
  <text start="2952.02" dur="5.65">the cheapest ways to go on the Internet</text>
  <text start="2954.7" dur="4.74">just just go right into the internet but</text>
  <text start="2957.67" dur="3.81">within a community just connect</text>
  <text start="2959.44" dur="3.9">everybody through the mesh net but if</text>
  <text start="2961.48" dur="5.04">you&amp;#39;re just way outside the group then</text>
  <text start="2963.34" dur="5.46">just connect in okay so what they they</text>
  <text start="2966.52" dur="3.75">have Wi-Fi currently you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2968.8" dur="3.75">kind of in a rural this is a very rural</text>
  <text start="2970.27" dur="3.78">area well then you may have the ability</text>
  <text start="2972.55" dur="5.88">to put up you&amp;#39;d have to have relay</text>
  <text start="2974.05" dur="6.54">stations like every mile or a mile I was</text>
  <text start="2978.43" dur="3.57">thinking all right and you might you</text>
  <text start="2980.59" dur="4.02">might have a pretty slow connection if</text>
  <text start="2982" dur="3.81">you&amp;#39;re doing that okay I don&amp;#39;t know and</text>
  <text start="2984.61" dur="4.2">then I wait a little bit longer for</text>
  <text start="2985.81" dur="4.41">these yeah really I mean I think but</text>
  <text start="2988.81" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re right I mean I think we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2990.22" dur="4.86">see decentralized everything I mean</text>
  <text start="2992.53" dur="3.36">really look at it this way we&amp;#39;re setting</text>
  <text start="2995.08" dur="2.4">up right now</text>
  <text start="2995.89" dur="3.18">we know we set up all these business</text>
  <text start="2997.48" dur="4.05">directors corporations all this stuff</text>
  <text start="2999.07" dur="3.3">all the privacy the banking and all that</text>
  <text start="3001.53" dur="5.37">but here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re really getting</text>
  <text start="3002.37" dur="7.68">into is setting up a business trust</text>
  <text start="3006.9" dur="5.43">structure that replaces a corporation so</text>
  <text start="3010.05" dur="4.89">were you today have an S corp or C</text>
  <text start="3012.33" dur="5.34">corporation in the future we can have an</text>
  <text start="3014.94" dur="4.62">a business trust which a corporation is</text>
  <text start="3017.67" dur="6.06">a trust actually but it&amp;#39;s a business</text>
  <text start="3019.56" dur="6.21">trust that&amp;#39;s run by software so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3023.73" dur="3.87">written not in legal language not in</text>
  <text start="3025.77" dur="3.87">statutory language but it&amp;#39;s written in</text>
  <text start="3027.6" dur="4.77">solidity a programming language for</text>
  <text start="3029.64" dur="5.34">aetherium crustless system yes a</text>
  <text start="3032.37" dur="4.11">crustless system right so basically when</text>
  <text start="3034.98" dur="4.05">you write this trust it&amp;#39;s a business</text>
  <text start="3036.48" dur="5.46">structure and it&amp;#39;s written in software</text>
  <text start="3039.03" dur="5.52">and it&amp;#39;s a smart contract based business</text>
  <text start="3041.94" dur="4.29">trust so that way the board of directors</text>
  <text start="3044.55" dur="4.14">a CEO and everybody who needs to use a</text>
  <text start="3046.23" dur="4.23">business has access or permissions to</text>
  <text start="3048.69" dur="4.98">the balance sheet because that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3050.46" dur="6.18">whole company right so only it has the</text>
  <text start="3053.67" dur="4.65">same structure as a regular company but</text>
  <text start="3056.64" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s no longer in the legal system and</text>
  <text start="3058.32" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s not chartered by the state and it</text>
  <text start="3061.56" dur="5.82">can&amp;#39;t be like broken necessary yeah be</text>
  <text start="3063.57" dur="4.74">broken and it&amp;#39;s private property private</text>
  <text start="3067.38" dur="2.67">property yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="3068.31" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s really where it&amp;#39;s gonna go so you</text>
  <text start="3070.05" dur="4.29">know these decentralized exchanges are</text>
  <text start="3071.85" dur="5.28">really the future so you&amp;#39;ll see it and</text>
  <text start="3074.34" dur="4.98">there&amp;#39;s a bit of a learning curve so but</text>
  <text start="3077.13" dur="4.89">right now I mean I still use old-school</text>
  <text start="3079.32" dur="3.45">low-tech stuff because I mean it&amp;#39;s easy</text>
  <text start="3082.02" dur="2.46">to handle</text>
  <text start="3082.77" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;m used to it I&amp;#39;ve been doing for 25</text>
  <text start="3084.48" dur="5.13">years and then as we get further on as</text>
  <text start="3087.81" dur="3.21">it becomes more mainstream more</text>
  <text start="3089.61" dur="3.51">mainstream people are gonna start</text>
  <text start="3091.02" dur="4.62">picking up Kryptos I mean there&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="3093.12" dur="4.38">now starting to learn about the Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="3095.64" dur="3.9">because I asked the cashier this at the</text>
  <text start="3097.5" dur="3.87">grocery store and they&amp;#39;re just now</text>
  <text start="3099.54" dur="3.18">starting to learn about it talk it up</text>
  <text start="3101.37" dur="4.95">every time I get a chance</text>
  <text start="3102.72" dur="6.36">yeah yeah a coin it&amp;#39;s worth way more</text>
  <text start="3106.32" dur="5.73">later than and and I salute people like</text>
  <text start="3109.08" dur="4.41">go go to your personal like top 10 items</text>
  <text start="3112.05" dur="2.94">that you buy and then compare the price</text>
  <text start="3113.49" dur="4.02">now to 10 years ago like that&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="3114.99" dur="4.74">inflation rate you know Bitcoin doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3117.51" dur="3.81">do that yeah well one thing I would</text>
  <text start="3119.73" dur="3.78">encourage your listeners to do to try</text>
  <text start="3121.32" dur="5.03">this one thing go to your bank and ask</text>
  <text start="3123.51" dur="5.67">about two-factor authentication</text>
  <text start="3126.35" dur="5.53">just just one simple free thing you can</text>
  <text start="3129.18" dur="4.29">do all right so that way any access to</text>
  <text start="3131.88" dur="4.02">your account would have to go through</text>
  <text start="3133.47" dur="4.02">two levels of permissions so it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3135.9" dur="3.42">less convenient it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="3137.49" dur="3.66">cool because like say if I write a check</text>
  <text start="3139.32" dur="4.35">and it gets to be cleared or something</text>
  <text start="3141.15" dur="4.74">or I issue funds somehow I get a request</text>
  <text start="3143.67" dur="3.39">on my phone for example do you want to</text>
  <text start="3145.89" dur="3.51">do this enter the code</text>
  <text start="3147.06" dur="4.56">I don&amp;#39;t know banks can do that okay</text>
  <text start="3149.4" dur="4.23">thanks can do that it&amp;#39;s not really</text>
  <text start="3151.62" dur="3.66">technical now you can go further but</text>
  <text start="3153.63" dur="3.57">basically if you want to try that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3155.28" dur="4.77">nice little experiment very cool yeah</text>
  <text start="3157.2" dur="4.59">and you you graciously offered a PDF</text>
  <text start="3160.05" dur="4.47">file for me to share with people as well</text>
  <text start="3161.79" dur="5.79">oh I&amp;#39;ll find a way to include that on my</text>
  <text start="3164.52" dur="4.89">site somehow is there is there any I</text>
  <text start="3167.58" dur="3">don&amp;#39;t want to take your time up too much</text>
  <text start="3169.41" dur="2.46">is there anything that you really want</text>
  <text start="3170.58" dur="2.96">to cover that we&amp;#39;ve missed that&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3171.87" dur="5.34">let&amp;#39;s tell let&amp;#39;s tell what&amp;#39;s in the PDF</text>
  <text start="3173.54" dur="6.64">yeah yeah what was the news everybody</text>
  <text start="3177.21" dur="5.13">asked me this I&amp;#39;ve got it on my desktop</text>
  <text start="3180.18" dur="7.17">here all right I don&amp;#39;t want to like miss</text>
  <text start="3182.34" dur="7.26">remember the name it is how to avoid I</text>
  <text start="3187.35" dur="5.19">think Le&amp;#39;Veon ghost your smartphone so</text>
  <text start="3189.6" dur="4.68">yeah how do I avoid Alevi which is kind</text>
  <text start="3192.54" dur="3.48">of like we&amp;#39;ve discussed earlier so you</text>
  <text start="3194.28" dur="3.93">open a bank account where you&amp;#39;re not the</text>
  <text start="3196.02" dur="4.23">exclusive owner of the money it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="3198.21" dur="4.8">way a personal debt that you</text>
  <text start="3200.25" dur="4.8">doesn&amp;#39;t attach to the account and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3203.01" dur="4.11">just as convenient as a regular personal</text>
  <text start="3205.05" dur="3.48">account with no risk because no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3207.12" dur="4.02">gonna sue the structure you created</text>
  <text start="3208.53" dur="4.26">because it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything and in</text>
  <text start="3211.14" dur="3.51">the difficulty basically is a little</text>
  <text start="3212.79" dur="3.27">paperwork and having us a signer right</text>
  <text start="3214.65" dur="3.06">that&amp;#39;s it you sign</text>
  <text start="3216.06" dur="3.45">you can sign just like you normally do</text>
  <text start="3217.71" dur="3.42">except now you&amp;#39;re signing as either the</text>
  <text start="3219.51" dur="4.41">vice-president or the trustee or</text>
  <text start="3221.13" dur="4.5">whatever that&amp;#39;s one thing that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3223.92" dur="3.48">as simple as it as it is right there I</text>
  <text start="3225.63" dur="3.24">mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s nuances but the</text>
  <text start="3227.4" dur="3.51">other thing is people say how do I get</text>
  <text start="3228.87" dur="4.02">encryption on my desktop so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3230.91" dur="4.29">couple of steps in there that tells you</text>
  <text start="3232.89" dur="4.65">in the article some open source software</text>
  <text start="3235.2" dur="3.78">you can download and there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3237.54" dur="3.15">open store there&amp;#39;s an application you</text>
  <text start="3238.98" dur="4.95">can download it gives you a phone number</text>
  <text start="3240.69" dur="5.04">and the phone number that you use allows</text>
  <text start="3243.93" dur="3">you to have complete encryption on your</text>
  <text start="3245.73" dur="3.92">communication so you can chat</text>
  <text start="3246.93" dur="5.22">videoconference and telephone people and</text>
  <text start="3249.65" dur="5.08">it becomes what&amp;#39;s called a black phone</text>
  <text start="3252.15" dur="4.92">right so nobody can even that even if</text>
  <text start="3254.73" dur="5.01">the NSA intercepts the signal for</text>
  <text start="3257.07" dur="5.84">example you can&amp;#39;t discern what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3259.74" dur="6.69">doing it has the signal but it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3262.91" dur="5.44">decrypt what you have okay that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="3266.43" dur="6.92">interesting I love the idea of having</text>
  <text start="3268.35" dur="8.19">that I know that took me that took me</text>
  <text start="3273.35" dur="6.4">thirty minutes from when I discovered it</text>
  <text start="3276.54" dur="4.74">from when I got it and yeah she&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3279.75" dur="3.24">that now on the flow and it tells you</text>
  <text start="3281.28" dur="3.69">step by step in the article how to</text>
  <text start="3282.99" dur="4.71">change over your desktop and why you</text>
  <text start="3284.97" dur="4.14">should and then on your phone I tell you</text>
  <text start="3287.7" dur="2.79">how to take you about 30 minutes to do</text>
  <text start="3289.11" dur="3.42">that you&amp;#39;re downloading free software</text>
  <text start="3290.49" dur="4.77">basically you got to do it in sequence</text>
  <text start="3292.53" dur="4.2">and so that then you&amp;#39;re taking another</text>
  <text start="3295.26" dur="4.32">step and so I found this whole process</text>
  <text start="3296.73" dur="5.52">of privacy is a really it takes a long</text>
  <text start="3299.58" dur="4.02">time it takes maybe a year year and a</text>
  <text start="3302.25" dur="3.3">half it depends on our urgently you need</text>
  <text start="3303.6" dur="5.16">it right like I can make one disappear</text>
  <text start="3305.55" dur="4.17">in seven days but what I did right so</text>
  <text start="3308.76" dur="2.52">then he has to spend the next year</text>
