  <text start="752.67" dur="3.63">know all the stuff that I had learned to</text>
  <text start="754.079" dur="4.2">try to help them I mean I even started a</text>
  <text start="756.3" dur="3.81">hundred chicken egg farm when I was</text>
  <text start="758.279" dur="4.651">fifteen I mean I was really serious</text>

  <text start="762.93" dur="2.31">the only one in the family that was</text>
  <text start="764.1" dur="2.76">serious about it and I learned a lot</text>

  <text start="766.86" dur="3.21">good time with it but you know it was</text>

  <text start="770.07" dur="5.91">trying to save people and you know after</text>
  <text start="773.07" dur="4.59">I started like 15 years old you know I</text>
  <text start="775.98" dur="3.69">started researching all this stuff and</text>
  <text start="777.66" dur="4.619">at the time it was very dark world for a</text>
  <text start="779.67" dur="4.26">teenager it was a lot of hope there was</text>
  <text start="782.279" dur="4.771">a lot of corruption there was a lot of</text>
  <text start="783.93" dur="3.81">misinformation started learning about</text>
  <text start="787.05" dur="3.69">the Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="787.74" dur="5.64">serve and how they yeah how they control</text>
  <text start="790.74" dur="4.73">us through wage slavery I learned about</text>
  <text start="793.38" dur="5.64">how rigged the game was I learned about</text>
  <text start="795.47" dur="5.32">customers rather than cures and I wanted</text>
  <text start="799.02" dur="2.9">to take that and do something for the</text>
  <text start="800.79" dur="4.74">world</text>
  <text start="801.92" dur="6.22">so because of my experiences and my</text>
  <text start="805.53" dur="4.71">natural stubbornness I kind of made it</text>
  <text start="808.14" dur="4.5">through public indoctrination where they</text>
  <text start="810.24" dur="3.93">teach you to to hate God they teach you</text>
  <text start="812.64" dur="3.75">to think that abortions normal they</text>
  <text start="814.17" dur="5.4">teach you that global warming is real</text>
  <text start="816.39" dur="5.22">and communism is the way you know that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="819.57" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s what he learned in school and I</text>
  <text start="821.61" dur="4.23">sort of reversed all of that after</text>
  <text start="823.35" dur="5.34">school and I did my own research and and</text>
  <text start="825.84" dur="6.09">that kind of brings us to the Q point Q</text>
  <text start="828.69" dur="5.25">is all about doing your own research but</text>
  <text start="831.93" dur="4.65">I came to a few realizations that were</text>
  <text start="833.94" dur="6.24">very important one is that Big Pharma is</text>
  <text start="836.58" dur="6.6">killing us fake news for number two is</text>
  <text start="840.18" dur="6.36">covering it up and three the Federal</text>
  <text start="843.18" dur="6.39">Reserve is enslaving us so I set out to</text>
  <text start="846.54" dur="5.13">learn everything that I could to protect</text>
  <text start="849.57" dur="3.96">my family protect myself but just</text>
  <text start="851.67" dur="4.95">protect people in general from some of</text>
  <text start="853.53" dur="5.07">these bullies out there I learned about</text>
  <text start="856.62" dur="4.19">the CDC whistleblower cover-ups I</text>
  <text start="858.6" dur="5.76">learned about the fake news lies and</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="4.33">about 9/11 and Iraq weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="864.36" dur="3.18">destruction</text>
  <text start="865.14" dur="5.19">those are lies more like weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="867.54" dur="4.83">distraction I learned about the fake new</text>
  <text start="870.33" dur="4.92">science that they&amp;#39;re using to as I said</text>
  <text start="872.37" dur="4.83">justify their tyranny and abuses and I</text>
  <text start="875.25" dur="4.62">didn&amp;#39;t want to end up that way I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="877.2" dur="5.46">when they end up working my whole life</text>
  <text start="879.87" dur="4.8">for this wage slave system only to have</text>
  <text start="882.66" dur="4.2">them push these immoral laws on me so I</text>
  <text start="884.67" dur="5.58">started to fight back at first it was</text>
  <text start="886.86" dur="6.45">just online I started to debate people</text>
  <text start="890.25" dur="5.34">you know leftist and Tifa types usually</text>
  <text start="893.31" dur="4.26">it wasn&amp;#39;t rewarding but I did learn a</text>
  <text start="895.59" dur="3.63">lot about debate and I learned the</text>
  <text start="897.57" dur="4.05">tactics that they use to manipulate</text>
  <text start="899.22" dur="4.59">people and this is you know even in the</text>
  <text start="901.62" dur="3.78">fake news media themselves they as you</text>
  <text start="903.81" dur="5.7">guys have seen will lie to you about</text>
  <text start="905.4" dur="6.33">right they will bring in false witnesses</text>
  <text start="909.51" dur="4.77">that pretend to be conservatives to bash</text>
  <text start="911.73" dur="4.71">our president they will go so far as to</text>
  <text start="914.28" dur="4.89">you know I would even argue Fox News</text>
  <text start="916.44" dur="4.17">itself for the most part are kind of</text>
  <text start="919.17" dur="2.22">playing for the enemy team they&amp;#39;re fake</text>
  <text start="920.61" dur="4.08">Magra</text>
  <text start="921.39" dur="5.31">in a sense and even President Trump he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="924.69" dur="5.04">brought this up many times where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="926.7" dur="5.34">talked about we need someone new but</text>
  <text start="929.73" dur="4.59">before we start really diving into cumin</text>
  <text start="932.04" dur="4.77">on in the digital Soldier thing I wanted</text>
  <text start="934.32" dur="5.34">to talk kind of before president Trump</text>
  <text start="936.81" dur="4.89">back when it was a dark world before</text>
  <text start="939.66" dur="7.92">most of us had hope if you were in the</text>
  <text start="941.7" dur="8.67">same boat as me I was a kind of a</text>
  <text start="947.58" dur="4.2">nihilistic guy I had given up I talked</text>
  <text start="950.37" dur="3.57">about this on my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="951.78" dur="3.63">I had given up thinking that I could</text>
  <text start="953.94" dur="4.71">change the world and I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="955.41" dur="6.06">survive it but after President Trump was</text>
  <text start="958.65" dur="6.3">elected you know like many of you I saw</text>
  <text start="961.47" dur="7.56">hope for the first time and I I felt</text>
  <text start="964.95" dur="7.26">relief it could have been her they never</text>
  <text start="969.03" dur="5.37">thought she would lose but then after q</text>
  <text start="972.21" dur="4.5">and on began posting I saw an</text>
  <text start="974.4" dur="5.37">opportunity to help spread small bread</text>
  <text start="976.71" dur="4.59">crumbs if you will to help red pill</text>
  <text start="979.77" dur="2.91">people about some of the truths that I</text>
  <text start="981.3" dur="6.63">had discovered you know in my own</text>
  <text start="982.68" dur="7.02">research and how to teach people to do</text>
  <text start="987.93" dur="4.08">their own homework instead of trusting</text>
  <text start="989.7" dur="4.05">the medium every time which is as I said</text>
  <text start="992.01" dur="3.21">what Q is all about is it&amp;#39;s doing your</text>
  <text start="993.75" dur="3.93">own homework it&amp;#39;s coming to these</text>
  <text start="995.22" dur="4.89">conclusions for yourself for the most</text>
  <text start="997.68" dur="4.41">part actually the queue anon movement is</text>
  <text start="1000.11" dur="3.63">the Socratic method it&amp;#39;s asking the</text>
  <text start="1002.09" dur="3.96">question let people find their own</text>
  <text start="1003.74" dur="3.86">answers learn for themselves and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1006.05" dur="3.75">very important because obviously that</text>
  <text start="1007.6" dur="4.56">the media wants you to believe that this</text>
  <text start="1009.8" dur="4.86">is a violent cult of crazy people that</text>
  <text start="1012.16" dur="4.39">don&amp;#39;t believe in nonsensical things but</text>
  <text start="1014.66" dur="4.08">in reality it&amp;#39;s just citizen journalists</text>
  <text start="1016.55" dur="5.94">doing homework doing research trying to</text>
  <text start="1018.74" dur="7.14">find the truth now I&amp;#39;ve kind of strayed</text>
  <text start="1022.49" dur="5.67">from my my speech a little bit my</text>
  <text start="1025.88" dur="5.579">channel grew at a pace of 1,200</text>
  <text start="1028.16" dur="5.039">subscribers per day it&amp;#39;s not anything to</text>
  <text start="1031.459" dur="3.541">do with me I&amp;#39;m convinced it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1033.199" dur="4.291">just the fact that people want to hear</text>
  <text start="1035" dur="3.87">the truth there&amp;#39;s a lot of demand out</text>
  <text start="1037.49" dur="3.63">there for the truth and anyone who</text>
  <text start="1038.87" dur="4.05">actually stands up and speaks it you</text>
  <text start="1041.12" dur="3.27">know you would have gotten a large</text>

  <text start="1066.83" dur="6">terms were I guess I was banned before</text>
  <text start="1069.17" dur="6.21">it was cool in a sense but you know I</text>
  <text start="1072.83" dur="5.28">saw it coming and I&amp;#39;ve seen massive</text>
  <text start="1075.38" dur="5.1">purges of conservative media and voices</text>
  <text start="1078.11" dur="4.47">that were independent I had seen many of</text>

  <text start="1082.58" dur="5.37">didn&amp;#39;t even try to monetize my channel I</text>
  <text start="1084.62" dur="4.29">knew that they would turn it off and you</text>
  <text start="1087.95" dur="3.75">know I&amp;#39;d seen people who had built</text>

  <text start="1097.06" dur="4.66">friends of mine broke down in tears when</text>
  <text start="1100.16" dur="2.52">this happened to them because they</text>
  <text start="1101.72" dur="4.47">didn&amp;#39;t know how they were gonna pay the</text>
  <text start="1102.68" dur="6.78">bills and YouTube pulled the plug the</text>
  <text start="1106.19" dur="6.12">algorithms the shadow banning on Twitter</text>
  <text start="1109.46" dur="4.71">the D boosting on Facebook these</text>

  <text start="1117.47" dur="3.78">isn&amp;#39;t popular isn&amp;#39;t cool no one cares</text>
  <text start="1120.44" dur="2.19">about him</text>
  <text start="1121.25" dur="3.63">same thing with queueing on by the way</text>
  <text start="1122.63" dur="5.16">to make it seem like we&amp;#39;re not popular</text>
  <text start="1124.88" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re just a fringe cult but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1127.79" dur="7.74">the case at all we already saw the power</text>
  <text start="1129.65" dur="8.07">of the silent majority in 2016 so after</text>
  <text start="1135.53" dur="4.68">I created the fake the channel to fight</text>
  <text start="1137.72" dur="5.06">fake news and I realized that the fake</text>
  <text start="1140.21" dur="6.33">news pundits could finally be beaten I</text>
  <text start="1142.78" dur="6.4">saw that we could as Q said break the</text>
  <text start="1146.54" dur="4.74">fake news that was a pretty big theme</text>
  <text start="1149.18" dur="3.9">early on and Q it&amp;#39;s one of the phrases</text>
  <text start="1151.28" dur="4.41">that he used often was break the media</text>
  <text start="1153.08" dur="4.62">break the MSM for a long time on my</text>
  <text start="1155.69" dur="3.36">channel that was what would pop up when</text>
  <text start="1157.7" dur="4.65">you first saw the channel it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1159.05" dur="6">break the fake news it was like a</text>
  <text start="1162.35" dur="5.31">mission for us and I feel like that was</text>
  <text start="1165.05" dur="6">originally what Q was about was creating</text>
  <text start="1167.66" dur="6.72">a citizen journalists army to go out and</text>
  <text start="1171.05" dur="6.21">fight fake media to fight fake news to</text>
  <text start="1174.38" dur="4.92">win back the narrative and I also feel</text>
  <text start="1177.26" dur="3.75">like we did that with the help of</text>
  <text start="1179.3" dur="3.93">President Trump constantly saying fake</text>
  <text start="1181.01" dur="4.41">news from Twitter and everywhere he</text>
  <text start="1183.23" dur="3.69">could get it in people started looking</text>
  <text start="1185.42" dur="3.15">for alternative facts they started</text>
  <text start="1186.92" dur="3.75">looking for alternative truths</text>
  <text start="1188.57" dur="3.63">they found alternative media and</text>
  <text start="1190.67" dur="5.27">everything else is history</text>
  <text start="1192.2" dur="6.15">we beat fake news and we beat them badly</text>
  <text start="1195.94" dur="3.34">everyone now knows the fake news it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1198.35" dur="2.82">not trustworthy</text>
  <text start="1199.28" dur="3.57">I think everyone&amp;#39;s heard about it I saw</text>
  <text start="1201.17" dur="3.9">a movie recently which I don&amp;#39;t watch</text>
  <text start="1202.85" dur="4.74">them often there&amp;#39;s so much propaganda</text>
  <text start="1205.07" dur="4.35">but in this movie a Hollywood movie a</text>
  <text start="1207.59" dur="3.51">spider-man movie I think they were</text>
  <text start="1209.42" dur="4.92">joking about how the media is always</text>
  <text start="1211.1" dur="5.7">trustworthy and never lie even they get</text>
  <text start="1214.34" dur="4.71">it spider-man movie so even the</text>
  <text start="1216.8" dur="3.96">propaganda is now coming our way so</text>
  <text start="1219.05" dur="4.53">everyone knows that they&amp;#39;re liars that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1220.76" dur="4.32">the power of the Overton Window the</text>
  <text start="1223.58" dur="4.62">president Trump shifted that Overton</text>
  <text start="1225.08" dur="6">Window with the word fake Magga yeah</text>
  <text start="1228.2" dur="4.47">with the word fake news and fake Magga I</text>
  <text start="1231.08" dur="2.61">would say as well as he&amp;#39;s that talked</text>
  <text start="1232.67" dur="4.8">about that is cute</text>
  <text start="1233.69" dur="6.15">but he&amp;#39;s also shifting the word traitor</text>
  <text start="1237.47" dur="5.37">he&amp;#39;s also shifting the word deep state</text>
  <text start="1239.84" dur="4.47">and he&amp;#39;s also shifting the word human</text>
  <text start="1242.84" dur="3.15">trafficker or the phrase human</text>

  <text start="1957.77" dur="3.36">were gonna try to control the narrative</text>
  <text start="1959.33" dur="2.25">so he had to get the truth out another</text>
  <text start="1961.13" dur="3.48">way</text>
  <text start="1961.58" dur="4.89">q and on is a way to do that without</text>

  <text start="1979.46" dur="4.59">that haven&amp;#39;t yet come out now this is an</text>
  <text start="1982.4" dur="3.6">interesting trick that q is used many</text>

  <text start="1994.28" dur="4.62">lot of sense like he actually predicted</text>
  <text start="1996.02" dur="5.28">for example the BD team Bangladeshi</text>

  <text start="2003.16" dur="4.74">multiple references to be eto Bangladesh</text>
  <text start="2005.26" dur="4.29">and then after we we found out about the</text>
  <text start="2007.9" dur="4.14">the terrorist attack so how did you know</text>
  <text start="2009.55" dur="4.08">about things like this he had inside</text>
  <text start="2012.04" dur="3.51">knowledge he just can&amp;#39;t come out and say</text>
  <text start="2013.63" dur="5.52">it because it violates national security</text>
