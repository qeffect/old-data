  <text start="218.67" dur="4.17">deserves the loyalty of the black</text>
  <text start="220.079" dur="4.891">community and with that I&amp;#39;m gonna switch</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="5.28">over to the Q non portion of the video</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="5.25">here we go guys with the Q non part of</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="5.25">the video now before I get into today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230.22" dur="7.47">posts I want to direct your attention</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="8.339">back to 1336 which was from yesterday in</text>
  <text start="237.69" dur="6.24">the 11th and it&amp;#39;s the post where Q</text>
  <text start="241.709" dur="4.221">basically links us to a reddit article</text>
  <text start="243.93" dur="5.1">where they&amp;#39;re talking about queuing on</text>
  <text start="245.93" dur="6.76">vs. Alex Jones and Corsi and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="7.709">going on with the info war basically</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="7.62">just an anti Alex Jones anti war z piece</text>
  <text start="256.739" dur="7.951">from Q so this this is a this is kind of</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="6.72">an attack no I don&amp;#39;t agree with Corsi</text>
  <text start="264.69" dur="4.92">claiming to have insider knowledge I</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="3.83">don&amp;#39;t agree with Alex Jones jumping on</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="5.059">the attack</text>
  <text start="270.86" dur="5.88">against cue and on with with just you</text>
  <text start="274.669" dur="3.93">know basically trying to make him seem</text>
  <text start="276.74" dur="3.329">more feminine and we can Dallas Jones</text>
  <text start="278.599" dur="4.5">just try and act all manly and stuff</text>
  <text start="280.069" dur="6.301">that&amp;#39;s not an argument but at the same</text>
  <text start="283.099" dur="4.891">time I&amp;#39;m trying to play neutral here I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="286.37" dur="4.68">trying to play devil&amp;#39;s advocate and look</text>
  <text start="287.99" dur="4.769">at this from both sides and Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="291.05" dur="3.81">has done a lot for the you know for the</text>
  <text start="292.759" dur="5.37">true through movement overall you know</text>
  <text start="294.86" dur="6.989">so he definitely has some street cred is</text>
  <text start="298.129" dur="5.641">he trying to you know destroy the</text>
  <text start="301.849" dur="4.801">movement to maintain profitability for</text>
  <text start="303.77" dur="5.399">his conspiracy theory Empire I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="306.65" dur="7.35">know it&amp;#39;s definitely a profit motive</text>
  <text start="309.169" dur="6.541">which you know everyone has one but Alex</text>
  <text start="314" dur="4.169">probably couldn&amp;#39;t do something else and</text>
  <text start="315.71" dur="3.319">make a lot of money he didn&amp;#39;t have to do</text>
  <text start="318.169" dur="6.3">what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="319.029" dur="6.73">so anyway I&amp;#39;m kind of on the fence right</text>
  <text start="324.469" dur="2.91">now I don&amp;#39;t really know what to think I</text>
  <text start="325.759" dur="5.551">still think alex is a good guy overall I</text>
  <text start="327.379" dur="7.47">think maybe Corsi and hem are impatient</text>
  <text start="331.31" dur="5.039">about the qa9 thing and maybe</text>
  <text start="334.849" dur="3.81">legitimately think Hugh has been</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="6.12">compromised so my perspective is to wait</text>
  <text start="338.659" dur="6.211">and see what Trump does okay we all we</text>
  <text start="342.469" dur="5.31">all still sort of you know I guess agree</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="4.68">that we support Trump so let&amp;#39;s see what</text>
  <text start="347.779" dur="3.331">Trump does if Trump does another one of</text>
  <text start="349.55" dur="3">those things where Q and him play that</text>
  <text start="351.11" dur="3.059">Twitter game and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="352.55" dur="4.829">building off each other</text>
  <text start="354.169" dur="5.191">balancing you know coincidences or Q</text>
  <text start="357.379" dur="4.951">incidences around as I start to call</text>
  <text start="359.36" dur="5.13">them now then we know that Trump is</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="4.709">still supporting Q enough to verify them</text>
  <text start="364.49" dur="4.56">and that means that this is all part of</text>
  <text start="367.039" dur="5.88">Trump&amp;#39;s plan and I&amp;#39;m cool with it</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="6.209">whatever if Trump does not do this for Q</text>
  <text start="372.919" dur="6.24">and another contender pops up and and</text>
  <text start="375.259" dur="5.91">Trump verifies them instead then we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="379.159" dur="4.711">know that this Q is compromised it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.169" dur="4.411">that simple we have to look to trump for</text>
  <text start="383.87" dur="4.349">the proof and this is what we&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="385.58" dur="4.23">done with q and on in the past if</text>
  <text start="388.219" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s been an issue with the trip code</text>
  <text start="389.81" dur="4.859">and he needs to prove himself to us we</text>
  <text start="392.449" dur="6.51">do we communicate with him something</text>
  <text start="394.669" dur="6.811">pops up you know like the ax or the the</text>
  <text start="398.959" dur="5.851">water bottle or whatever</text>
  <text start="401.48" dur="6.27">and trumple then do it to prove or</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="6.12">certain keyword things like that you</text>
  <text start="407.75" dur="6.9">know Goodwin Goodwin whatever so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.93" dur="6.12">where we&amp;#39;re at now I I caution to wait I</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="4.14">think they call it the smudge principle</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.94">or something wait 24 hours when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.79" dur="6">not sure about anything see what happens</text>
  <text start="421.99" dur="3.88">and then we&amp;#39;re gonna go up here where it</text>
  <text start="424.79" dur="5.43">really gets interesting</text>
  <text start="425.87" dur="6.39">- 1337 someone posted we&amp;#39;ve all been</text>
  <text start="430.22" dur="4.17">blinded for too long Alex Jones is not</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="6.27">all media he is a traitor makes us all</text>
  <text start="434.39" dur="7.47">look crazy fm-q says time to move on big</text>
  <text start="438.53" dur="6.69">week ahead now if that were it no big</text>
  <text start="441.86" dur="7.5">deal but then he posts this Alex Jones</text>
  <text start="445.22" dur="5.61">performance artist thing now I have been</text>
  <text start="449.36" dur="3.96">on the other like I&amp;#39;ve been defending</text>
  <text start="450.83" dur="3.96">Alex Jones over this argument for a long</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="3.96">time all right</text>
  <text start="454.79" dur="6.02">when Alex Jones dresses up in Joker face</text>
  <text start="457.28" dur="7.32">and does they&amp;#39;re a two minutes kit as a</text>
  <text start="460.81" dur="5.65">satirical humor comedy way of still</text>
  <text start="464.6" dur="3.51">communicating a truth so you know</text>
  <text start="466.46" dur="4.47">artists sometimes use lies to tell the</text>
  <text start="468.11" dur="4.59">truth well he dresses up like the devil</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="3.8">or he dresses up like Joker face or he</text>
  <text start="472.7" dur="3.87">dresses up like some something and</text>
  <text start="474.73" dur="3.76">pretends to want to give all the kids</text>
  <text start="476.57" dur="5.22">fluoride as a way to tell you about how</text>
  <text start="478.49" dur="5.07">bad fluoride is this is called satire</text>
  <text start="481.79" dur="5.01">this is called performance artists in</text>
  <text start="483.56" dur="4.26">court so yes Alex Jones does that and</text>
  <text start="486.8" dur="2.4">yes when he&amp;#39;s doing that he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="487.82" dur="3.69">performance artist that does not mean</text>
  <text start="489.2" dur="6.42">the other 99% of everything that he does</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="5.97">is is also satire and performance art so</text>
  <text start="495.62" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s one of those things that</text>
  <text start="497.48" dur="4.2">they try to the media tried to smear</text>
  <text start="499.19" dur="4.86">Jones with when in reality it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="501.68" dur="5.1">another big nothing burgers another big</text>
  <text start="504.05" dur="7.52">non argument so 2cq use this is really</text>
  <text start="506.78" dur="4.79">kind of troubling this is the most</text>
  <text start="511.599" dur="4.721">evident evidentiary thing that I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="514.339" dur="4.591">so far that that really makes me think</text>
  <text start="516.32" dur="4.08">maybe Q was compromised and if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="518.93" dur="3.65">the case I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;ll be long</text>
  <text start="520.4" dur="5.01">before the real Q reestablishes himself</text>
  <text start="522.58" dur="6.82">with the proof method that I mentioned</text>
  <text start="525.41" dur="7.05">before so why would you use a false</text>
  <text start="529.4" dur="3.58">argument a logical fallacy argument</text>
  <text start="532.46" dur="4.48">again</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="5.94">Alex Jones if you&amp;#39;re not trying to</text>
  <text start="536.94" dur="4.5">divide the movement but you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="538.92" dur="5.04">trying to weed out chills and profit</text>

  <text start="543.96" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;m not once again I&amp;#39;m not making a</text>
  <text start="545.85" dur="6.12">decision yet I&amp;#39;m taking this into</text>

  <text start="571.32" dur="9.27">really easy here is a really long post</text>
  <text start="575.96" dur="6.85">1339 so he says they attempted to</text>

  <text start="595.5" dur="4.23">established I I surmised earlier on that</text>
  <text start="598.02" dur="3.66">maybe Alex Jones just couldn&amp;#39;t risk his</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="3.93">reputation on something too unproven too</text>
  <text start="601.68" dur="4.71">new he waited a little while to get him</text>
  <text start="603.66" dur="5.34">and he let course he bring it to him</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="5.01">kind of officially and then he adopted</text>
  <text start="609" dur="6.6">it and he took it and made it even</text>
