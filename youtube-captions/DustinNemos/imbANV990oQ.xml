  <text start="10.71" dur="3.15">take it for granted</text>
  <text start="11.7" dur="6.06">Donald Trump has put out an interesting</text>
  <text start="13.86" dur="5.31">tweet now this is a kind of it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="17.76" dur="3.9">a headline you know this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="19.17" dur="5.13">this is breaking news so he actually</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="4.709">says on June 10th the US will impose a</text>
  <text start="24.3" dur="5.34">five percent tariff on all goods coming</text>
  <text start="26.369" dur="5.101">into our country from Mexico until such</text>
  <text start="29.64" dur="5.13">time as illegal migrants coming through</text>
  <text start="31.47" dur="5.01">Mexico and into our country stop the</text>
  <text start="34.77" dur="3.809">tariff will gradually increase until the</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="4.47">illegal immigration problem is remedied</text>
  <text start="38.579" dur="4.741">and then following he says at which time</text>
  <text start="40.95" dur="6.33">the tariffs will be removed details from</text>
  <text start="43.32" dur="7.11">the White House to follow so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="5.79">be real honest here I mean we&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="50.43" dur="4.379">we&amp;#39;re the US and that&amp;#39;s Mexico and the</text>
  <text start="53.07" dur="4.68">relationship and after everything else</text>
  <text start="54.809" dur="4.621">in the past has been very parasitic they</text>
  <text start="57.75" dur="3.239">are definitely making out just like</text>
  <text start="59.43" dur="4.14">China way better just like most people</text>
  <text start="60.989" dur="5.101">and everyone way better than we are on</text>
  <text start="63.57" dur="5.22">the trade deficit now I imagine that a</text>
  <text start="66.09" dur="4.56">five percent tariff on all of their</text>
  <text start="68.79" dur="4.079">goods coming in will probably at least</text>
  <text start="70.65" dur="5.73">be a 1 percent hit to their entire GDP I</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="6.601">don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s just a educated</text>
  <text start="76.38" dur="6.66">guess and I am NOT obviously an expert</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="5.25">on the Mexican GDP I&amp;#39;m I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="83.04" dur="3.3">consider myself an expert on</text>
  <text start="84.72" dur="2.91">International Economics but for some</text>
  <text start="86.34" dur="5.01">reason people keep listening to me about</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="5.16">the topic but you know at least gold</text>
  <text start="91.35" dur="4.019">silver or currency those kind of things</text>
  <text start="92.79" dur="4.74">the bigger picture Federal Reserve</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="3.811">central banking concepts historical</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="3.78">trends you know some of this stuff like</text>
  <text start="99.18" dur="4.68">yeah I&amp;#39;ve got some good mentors I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="101.31" dur="4.949">some good advice coming in but you know</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="4.53">I I&amp;#39;m just a guy who knows a lot of</text>
  <text start="106.259" dur="3.54">people I don&amp;#39;t want to kind of toot my</text>
  <text start="108.39" dur="4.619">own horn is any kind of an expert on</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="5.011">these things I&amp;#39;m sometimes as surprised</text>
  <text start="113.009" dur="4.29">as you got me you guys are on some of</text>
  <text start="114.81" dur="6.18">the outcomes but um this is a good move</text>
  <text start="117.299" dur="5.64">by Trump in a larger economic sense I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="3.39">still very worried I can&amp;#39;t just talk</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="3.841">about the economy without saying</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="4.73">everything bubble really loudly many</text>
  <text start="126.78" dur="4.89">times everything bubble everything level</text>
  <text start="129.11" dur="4.39">what Trump is doing is taking advantage</text>
  <text start="131.67" dur="4.35">of the system that they&amp;#39;ve always take</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="4.29">advantage of manipulating things behind</text>
  <text start="136.02" dur="5.9">the scenes to give a good economy and</text>
  <text start="137.79" dur="7.08">that is a Sharad it is a it is a</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="5.46">confidence game if you don&amp;#39;t believe me</text>
  <text start="144.87" dur="4.59">check out my friend Lynette zing or</text>
  <text start="147.38" dur="3.73">Gregg men arena or anywhere the others</text>
  <text start="149.46" dur="3.23">who are actually covering these issues</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="5.85">it is lutherie</text>
  <text start="152.69" dur="5.56">this this whole economy and I imagine</text>
  <text start="156.96" dur="4.08">that Trump can probably keep it going</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="4.32">until after election because I think</text>
  <text start="161.04" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s his plan is to deal with this</text>
  <text start="162.57" dur="8.91">issue later and try for now to deal with</text>
  <text start="165.39" dur="7.74">corruption and keep order but obviously</text>
  <text start="171.48" dur="3.63">the bad guys would want to tank the</text>
  <text start="173.13" dur="3.63">economy any way to give nationalism and</text>
  <text start="175.11" dur="3.3">Trump a bad name try to destroy him try</text>
  <text start="176.76" dur="6.24">to stop him try to hurt us try to punish</text>
  <text start="178.41" dur="6.48">us I mean just look it look at this new</text>
  <text start="183" dur="3.63">world they&amp;#39;ll film in many other</text>
  <text start="184.89" dur="2.97">countries where abortion is illegal even</text>
  <text start="186.63" dur="3">where gays will be killed because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="5.09">illegal but they won&amp;#39;t film in Georgia</text>
  <text start="189.63" dur="5.19">now because of the abortion ban so</text>
  <text start="192.95" dur="6.069">obviously there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a sellout</text>
  <text start="194.82" dur="8.46">problem as well on a globalist evil</text>
  <text start="199.019" dur="7.231">issue as well but just in terms of math</text>
  <text start="203.28" dur="4.739">just in terms of logic just in terms of</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="4.56">Reason just in terms of what you can go</text>
  <text start="208.019" dur="5.401">and prove for yourself right now</text>
  <text start="210.81" dur="4.53">you know just pay attention to some of</text>

  <text start="307.599" dur="5.25">like he was the good guy all of these</text>
  <text start="310.66" dur="5.64">things in history are tied to the</text>
  <text start="312.849" dur="6.681">philosophy and the economics and the</text>
  <text start="316.3" dur="4.38">history and the pies all together so Oh</text>

  <text start="326.74" dur="3.929">not talking stock market boring graphs</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;m talking pretty basic principles that</text>
  <text start="330.669" dur="3.541">you can navigate your life by and teach</text>
  <text start="332.44" dur="3.21">others to navigate their life by so they</text>

  <text start="335.65" dur="5.639">exploited financially by governments</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="3.63">especially all right these are the kind</text>
  <text start="341.289" dur="4.141">of freedom principles that you need to</text>
  <text start="342.94" dur="8.43">be armed this is philosophy and history</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="8.22">is your weaponry against evil and</text>
  <text start="351.37" dur="4.169">against tyranny because those issue--</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="5.31">things not only allowing you to have the</text>
  <text start="355.539" dur="5.071">weapons to take on that fight and to do</text>
  <text start="358.96" dur="2.639">so from a position of confidence but</text>
  <text start="360.61" dur="3.48">they allowing you to know who your</text>

  <text start="368.139" dur="3.991">for by this are they known right so</text>
  <text start="370.75" dur="3.24">there are psychopaths that can deceive</text>
  <text start="372.13" dur="3.42">and manipulate but for the most part</text>
  <text start="373.99" dur="3.06">that&amp;#39;s a cultural thing and you know</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="3.959">based on the culture what you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="377.05" dur="4.919">into if you understand cultures are</text>
  <text start="379.509" dur="5.851">different and that&amp;#39;s a beautiful thing I</text>
  <text start="381.969" dur="5.221">love variety right but you have to know</text>
  <text start="385.36" dur="3.33">your values you have to know your</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="3.59">philosophy you have to know these things</text>
  <text start="388.69" dur="4.5">and those of your friends and allies and</text>
  <text start="390.78" dur="5.059">if you know your friends you know your</text>
  <text start="393.19" dur="5.809">enemies you will not be surprised in 100</text>
  <text start="395.839" dur="5.26">so um that&amp;#39;s just kind of my fought on</text>
  <text start="398.999" dur="4.17">this and I I realized I got a little bit</text>
  <text start="401.099" dur="6">philosophical on that I&amp;#39;ll jump to the</text>
  <text start="403.169" dur="7.65">next video but you know it is really all</text>
  <text start="407.099" dur="6">connected everything and people they</text>
  <text start="410.819" dur="5.22">think economics are boring or too hard</text>
  <text start="413.099" dur="4.68">which it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be and they</text>
  <text start="416.039" dur="5.61">think you know fighting evil is too</text>
  <text start="417.779" dur="7.02">controversial or not cool not anymore</text>
  <text start="421.649" dur="5.94">they think no socialism is cool or</text>
  <text start="424.799" dur="6.63">whatever we&amp;#39;ll not if you understand 2+2</text>
  <text start="427.589" dur="5.7">is 4 and you know just basic mathematics</text>
  <text start="431.429" dur="4.681">can disprove socialism and the incentive</text>
  <text start="433.289" dur="3.3">structure or all off you know it sounds</text>
  <text start="436.11" dur="2.009">good</text>
  <text start="436.589" dur="3.03">to steal from people to help other</text>
  <text start="438.119" dur="3.06">people and and all that other stuff but</text>
  <text start="439.619" dur="6.29">it&amp;#39;s actually about incentive structure</text>
  <text start="441.179" dur="9.9">it creates tyranny and oligarchy so</text>
  <text start="445.909" dur="6.97">really as much as I love and support</text>
  <text start="451.079" dur="4.11">what Trump is doing with the tax thing</text>
  <text start="452.879" dur="6.6">here I think that we have greater issues</text>
  <text start="455.189" dur="6.21">to resolve I think that for example the</text>
  <text start="459.479" dur="3.6">welfare system as long as that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="461.399" dur="3.33">place there&amp;#39;s never gonna be a wall big</text>
  <text start="463.079" dur="3.51">enough there&amp;#39;s never gonna be a tariff</text>
  <text start="464.729" dur="4.62">big enough there&amp;#39;s never gonna be a</text>
  <text start="466.589" dur="4.98">Mexican military big enough to stop the</text>
  <text start="469.349" dur="3.75">flow of getting through Mexico they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="471.569" dur="3.9">swim if they have to they&amp;#39;ll take boats</text>
  <text start="473.099" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;ll fly they&amp;#39;ll bribe the lie though</text>
  <text start="475.469" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;ll cheat they&amp;#39;re still most of them</text>
  <text start="476.849" dur="5.22">just can&amp;#39;t flow might in any way they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="480.599" dur="2.7">do whatever it takes because there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="482.069" dur="3.66">welfare system that will take care of</text>
  <text start="483.299" dur="3.69">them ten times or a hundred times any</text>
  <text start="485.729" dur="3.81">kind of quality of life that they would</text>
  <text start="486.989" dur="3.93">have ever gotten back home because they</text>
  <text start="489.539" dur="5.04">live in holes in some cases and</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="5.79">because of socialism mostly and also</text>
  <text start="494.579" dur="3.21">like predatory you know crony capitalism</text>
  <text start="496.709" dur="2.58">which is an entirely different issue</text>
  <text start="497.789" dur="4.321">imperialism and all that other stuff but</text>
  <text start="499.289" dur="6.84">I digress</text>
