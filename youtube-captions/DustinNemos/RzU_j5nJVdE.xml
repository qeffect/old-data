  <text start="1.34" dur="8.469">welcome back my friends so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="6.72" dur="5.1">take just a quick few minutes to address</text>
  <text start="9.809" dur="4.851">some of the concerns that are being</text>
  <text start="11.82" dur="7.44">floated around about the discord chat</text>
  <text start="14.66" dur="7.93">program now discord is basically sort of</text>
  <text start="19.26" dur="5.48">a newer version of teamspeak or Ventrilo</text>
  <text start="22.59" dur="5.759">if you know what those are it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="24.74" dur="5.32">basically chat programs that gamers love</text>
  <text start="28.349" dur="3.571">to use because when you&amp;#39;re in the video</text>
  <text start="30.06" dur="4.23">games and you&amp;#39;re you know like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="31.92" dur="3.78">doing a big fight with them like a big</text>
  <text start="34.29" dur="2.73">monster or something or like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="35.7" dur="3.96">about to go kill a dragon with your</text>
  <text start="37.02" dur="4.289">teammates you need to be able to react</text>
  <text start="39.66" dur="3.149">quickly you need to be able to use voice</text>
  <text start="41.309" dur="4.351">to communicate with a large number of</text>
  <text start="42.809" dur="5.101">people or at least be able to type and</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="3.66">you know the programs and the features</text>
  <text start="47.91" dur="3.12">have just gotten better and better over</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="5.73">time discord is like the best I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="5.73">seen it is basically a room very</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="4.439">customizable with different rooms</text>
  <text start="56.76" dur="4.889">different settings privacy different</text>
  <text start="59.489" dur="3.48">roles different colors of names there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="61.649" dur="4.051">a lot you can do with it that are useful</text>
  <text start="62.969" dur="4.521">for organizing and such you can share a</text>
  <text start="65.7" dur="3.84">video links you can share images</text>
  <text start="67.49" dur="5.02">directly you don&amp;#39;t even have to host the</text>
  <text start="69.54" dur="5.1">images so for the purposes of research</text>
  <text start="72.51" dur="4.35">in queue and on communicating about this</text>
  <text start="74.64" dur="5.76">stuff staying up to date being able to</text>
  <text start="76.86" dur="6.299">discuss and learn discord is a wonderful</text>
  <text start="80.4" dur="5.13">wonderful tool now a lot of people keep</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="4.741">telling me that Natasha one of the other</text>
  <text start="85.53" dur="4.17">youtubers is it&amp;#39;s warning people about</text>
  <text start="87.9" dur="4.35">it and her video is called dangerous</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="6.69">toxic website of discord like a virus my</text>
  <text start="92.25" dur="5.43">advice to not sign on now I remember she</text>
  <text start="96.39" dur="3.63">actually sent me a message and told me</text>
  <text start="97.68" dur="5.13">she was getting off and this is nothing</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="4.559">against Natasha this is just a I think</text>
  <text start="102.81" dur="5.309">in my opinion this was a bad experience</text>
  <text start="104.579" dur="5.4">based off of someone who does not</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="4.5">understand how the program works okay</text>
  <text start="109.979" dur="4.35">now I did not watch her entire video I</text>
  <text start="112.619" dur="5.331">kind of got the gist of what she was</text>
  <text start="114.329" dur="6.091">going into with it very quickly on but</text>
  <text start="117.95" dur="3.97">she complained about the bells and the</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.199">beeps and the noises okay every time</text>
  <text start="121.92" dur="4.589">someone types a little thing happens</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="4.291">sometimes you hear it in my videos this</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="4.351">is as simple as hitting the little bell</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="4.71">icon in the top right corner of the chat</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="5.939">room and that particular chat room will</text>
  <text start="133.62" dur="4.74">Lord EMU now if there&amp;#39;s 20 chat rooms in</text>
  <text start="136.799" dur="3.351">there you will have to go through all 20</text>
  <text start="138.36" dur="4.17">of them if you want no dings at all</text>
  <text start="140.15" dur="3.85">there may actually be an option in the</text>
  <text start="142.53" dur="3.84">settings to just kill all of them at</text>
  <text start="144" dur="5.819">once or to lower the volume I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="5.22">haven&amp;#39;t done that I selectively edit it</text>
  <text start="149.819" dur="4.381">so that I can still hear my patrons when</text>
  <text start="151.59" dur="5.729">they deem me and on my private patreon</text>
  <text start="154.2" dur="4.44">chat and I don&amp;#39;t hear all of the</text>
  <text start="157.319" dur="3.301">thousands of things that are going</text>
  <text start="158.64" dur="7.469">through the public free Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="160.62" dur="6.869">chat now I don&amp;#39;t think she had actually</text>
  <text start="166.109" dur="3.421">muted her stuff I think she probably</text>
  <text start="167.489" dur="4.08">muted like the one chat and then still</text>
  <text start="169.53" dur="3.989">heard the other chats ok that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="171.569" dur="6.51">she&amp;#39;s complaining about noises things</text>
  <text start="173.519" dur="7.261">like that let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s be honest here</text>
  <text start="178.079" dur="4.951">let&amp;#39;s be clear there is a vast</text>
  <text start="180.78" dur="5.34">difference in understanding of how these</text>
  <text start="183.03" dur="5.429">these programs work between generations</text>
  <text start="186.12" dur="4.89">you know older generations do not catch</text>
  <text start="188.459" dur="4.89">on to these things very easily generally</text>
  <text start="191.01" dur="3.839">and younger generations just they</text>
  <text start="193.349" dur="3.901">already know it right they grew up on</text>
  <text start="194.849" dur="4.941">this stuff and that is just simply a</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="7.319">difference in time and experience right</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="6.37">so she describes it as nauseating and</text>
  <text start="204.569" dur="3.42">scary she makes a lot of assumptions</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="3.03">about how they&amp;#39;re spying on you or</text>
  <text start="207.989" dur="3.421">something like that there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="209.19" dur="4.829">of that that I&amp;#39;m aware of this is</text>
  <text start="211.41" dur="6.32">actually a very lightweight program it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.019" dur="7.711">not very bulky as far as file size and</text>
  <text start="217.73" dur="6.28">complexity you can actually use it from</text>
  <text start="221.73" dur="4.14">the webpage rather than downloading</text>
  <text start="224.01" dur="6.72">anything at all if you want you can use</text>
  <text start="225.87" dur="6.75">the discord web chat room I personally</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="5.879">use the app I downloaded it I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="232.62" dur="6.299">had any problems at all but so many</text>
  <text start="236.609" dur="4.38">people have said hate Natasha says it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.919" dur="4.801">bad don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t get it and I had to look</text>
  <text start="240.989" dur="4.741">into it finally I I just I don&amp;#39;t see any</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="3.87">merit to her argument right remember I</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="3.569">like to talk about the argument she</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="4.109">makes a lot of assumptions she uses</text>
  <text start="249.299" dur="4.41">scary words and she calls it things like</text>
  <text start="251.699" dur="4.47">a virus things like that I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.709" dur="4.62">I think that&amp;#39;s misleading you know</text>
  <text start="256.169" dur="4.201">nothing against Natasha obviously she</text>
  <text start="258.329" dur="4.481">had a bad experience but I definitely</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="5.919">think that&amp;#39;s misleading</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="6.389">now as far as deleting it closing it</text>
  <text start="266.289" dur="4.651">down apparently there may be like a wait</text>
  <text start="269.199" dur="4.231">time for your account to actually be</text>
  <text start="270.94" dur="4.17">shut down I don&amp;#39;t know about that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="273.43" dur="4.2">never shot mine down like that</text>
  <text start="275.11" dur="5.16">I never uninstalled it but that that is</text>
  <text start="277.63" dur="4.469">not proof that they&amp;#39;re spying on you or</text>
  <text start="280.27" dur="6.36">anything like that I don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="282.099" dur="7.41">she got that from maybe just so many</text>
  <text start="286.63" dur="5.969">companies these days do spy on you but</text>
  <text start="289.509" dur="4.56">as far as invasion of privacy um you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.599" dur="3.72">not you you shouldn&amp;#39;t use your real name</text>
  <text start="294.069" dur="6.541">on these things anyway you should</text>
  <text start="296.319" dur="6.63">probably pick a alias or a pin name or</text>
  <text start="300.61" dur="5.94">something pseudo identity you know</text>
  <text start="302.949" dur="6.051">people use use names like just to give</text>
  <text start="306.55" dur="7.08">you some examples Eureka Phi Manik</text>
  <text start="309" dur="6.46">Richard krill PC Lake pirate things like</text>
  <text start="313.63" dur="3.689">that these are the these are your</text>
  <text start="315.46" dur="3.42">handles that people will come to see you</text>
  <text start="317.319" dur="3.271">ass but don&amp;#39;t use your real name because</text>
  <text start="318.88" dur="3.029">you don&amp;#39;t you want to try to avoid doing</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="3.72">that anywhere on the Internet not</text>
  <text start="321.909" dur="4.111">because it&amp;#39;s particularly dangerous here</text>
  <text start="324.31" dur="2.789">we&amp;#39;re actually doing a pretty good job</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="3.57">at least in the great awakening</text>
  <text start="327.099" dur="5.04">community of keeping people that are</text>
  <text start="329.59" dur="4.59">trolls or something out because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="332.139" dur="4.051">assigned moderators to that and they can</text>
  <text start="334.18" dur="5.1">ban people we&amp;#39;ve only had to ban like</text>
  <text start="336.19" dur="6.719">five or six people so but we did it</text>
  <text start="339.28" dur="5.389">quickly now I even had the for your</text>
  <text start="342.909" dur="5.431">information I even had the guy that was</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="5.47">trying to he claims that he was the one</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="4.29">who had me banned from YouTube and</text>
  <text start="350.139" dur="4.02">GoFundMe he was bragging about it kept</text>
  <text start="352.63" dur="4.71">trying to tell me his name which I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="354.159" dur="5.04">even remember at this point because I</text>
  <text start="357.34" dur="3.419">mean someone that dishonest and that</text>
  <text start="359.199" dur="4.101">immoral wouldn&amp;#39;t probably give you their</text>
  <text start="360.759" dur="4.921">real name anyway I remember the guy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.3" dur="4">username from when he had been posting</text>
  <text start="365.68" dur="3.09">on my youtube comments and just saying a</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="3.179">bunch of negative stuff as well so I</text>
  <text start="368.77" dur="4.649">have a stalker and he found me on</text>
  <text start="370.479" dur="5.49">discord and then I banned him so not a</text>
  <text start="373.419" dur="4.981">big deal but I just wanted to clear this</text>
  <text start="375.969" dur="4.681">up because definitely um you know I run</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="4.259">I run cryptocurrency stuff on my</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="6">computer I don&amp;#39;t want any viruses that</text>
  <text start="382.659" dur="5.521">would steal my money I have grown up on</text>
  <text start="386.65" dur="3.84">the Internet I&amp;#39;m definitely not a tech</text>
  <text start="388.18" dur="4.289">expert but I&amp;#39;m usually pretty good about</text>
  <text start="390.49" dur="4.649">keeping viruses off my computer I run</text>
  <text start="392.469" dur="3.481">multiple programs including malwarebytes</text>
  <text start="395.139" dur="5.131">window</text>
  <text start="395.95" dur="8.43">security in on this computer I also have</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="5.88">McAfee cuz it came with it so I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t see any problems with it so please</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="5.55">don&amp;#39;t let one person&amp;#39;s bad experience</text>
  <text start="408.46" dur="5.88">and scary words dissuade you from</text>
  <text start="411.7" dur="4.62">joining us in this chatroom the Great</text>

  <text start="434.68" dur="3.57">and we&amp;#39;re all following what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="436.66" dur="4.2">with q and on but we all approach it</text>
  <text start="438.25" dur="5.91">from our own perspectives and and and</text>

  <text start="468.73" dur="4.5">bad about Natasha I haven&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="471.7" dur="3.6">watched a lot of her channel because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="473.23" dur="3.93">so busy just gathering the news every</text>
  <text start="475.3" dur="4.23">day and then managing the discord is</text>
  <text start="477.16" dur="3.84">taking up a lot of time as well so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="479.53" dur="4.32">doing a lot of delegating on there as</text>
  <text start="481" dur="5.55">well I&amp;#39;ve even got a team of people that</text>
  <text start="483.85" dur="5.61">have volunteered to help me spread links</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="5.55">and share my videos to various chat</text>
  <text start="489.46" dur="5.1">rooms each time I do a video that way I</text>
  <text start="492.1" dur="3.69">can reach potentially millions of people</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="3.78">if you&amp;#39;re interested in volunteering</text>
  <text start="495.79" dur="4.92">then you know come on down and let us</text>
  <text start="498.34" dur="4.5">know you want to help out we&amp;#39;ll find</text>
  <text start="500.71" dur="5.97">something for you to do a few minutes a</text>
  <text start="502.84" dur="5.31">day anyway that&amp;#39;s it hopefully we will</text>
  <text start="506.68" dur="4.41">see you guys in the Great Awakening</text>
  <text start="508.15" dur="5.03">community discord chat room you can find</text>
  <text start="511.09" dur="6.75">links to it in my descriptions on</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="6.58">YouTube Vimeo I don&amp;#39;t know if my bitch</text>
  <text start="517.84" dur="4.2">chute has the description set up yet but</text>
  <text start="519.76" dur="5.22">I know that my D Tube generally has it</text>
  <text start="522.04" dur="5.64">as well and I think I actually have it</text>
  <text start="524.98" dur="4.26">pinned to my Twitter so if you want to</text>
  <text start="527.68" dur="2.14">go to Twitter and just look at all my</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="2.8">links</text>
  <text start="529.82" dur="3.96">pinned a bunch of stuff at the top you</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="5.04">can go down to the discord chat room and</text>
  <text start="533.78" dur="4.77">copy paste that into your browser and be</text>
  <text start="537.08" dur="3.38">there with us in a few minutes you just</text>
  <text start="538.55" dur="6.5">have to set up like a username and stuff</text>
  <text start="540.46" dur="7.18">so that&amp;#39;s what this is it&amp;#39;s a program</text>
  <text start="545.05" dur="4.75">kind of designed around kids playing</text>
  <text start="547.64" dur="6.21">video games but it became very useful</text>
  <text start="549.8" dur="6.21">for us as well so it&amp;#39;s a wonderful way</text>
  <text start="553.85" dur="3.48">at least for now to communicate we</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="2.97">haven&amp;#39;t had any kind of like censorship</text>
  <text start="557.33" dur="4.44">problems or anything like that that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="558.98" dur="6.63">aware of you know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="561.77" dur="6">following queue use this I was not the</text>
  <text start="565.61" dur="6.05">first I was probably I don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="567.77" dur="6.36">second but you know the CBTs crowd use</text>
  <text start="571.66" dur="7.24">to coordinate on their research as well</text>
  <text start="574.13" dur="6.21">so either way just wanted to get this</text>
  <text start="578.9" dur="2.91">out there for those who are kind of</text>
  <text start="580.34" dur="2.37">afraid of it or on the fence or</text>
  <text start="581.81" dur="2.34">something because I don&amp;#39;t want people</text>
