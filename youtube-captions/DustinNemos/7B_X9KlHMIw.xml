  <text start="3.99" dur="2.46">emos</text>
  <text start="4.56" dur="4.35">and I have a pleasant surprise for you</text>
  <text start="6.45" dur="7.2">this evening there are two new queue</text>
  <text start="8.91" dur="6.389">posts some weird things are going on on</text>
  <text start="13.65" dur="4.26">my end here I can go to certain websites</text>
  <text start="15.299" dur="4.501">I can&amp;#39;t go to others so maybe that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="4.14">something on my end like Google YouTube</text>
  <text start="19.8" dur="6.26">work I can get the queue post but I</text>
  <text start="22.05" dur="4.01">can&amp;#39;t open the links for the queue posts</text>
  <text start="26.21" dur="5.29">however I&amp;#39;ll still read through and see</text>
  <text start="29.16" dur="3.509">what we can do with it I don&amp;#39;t it could</text>
  <text start="31.5" dur="2.55">just be that there are a lot of people</text>
  <text start="32.669" dur="3.241">checking those links and it crashed</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s web sites or something they are</text>
  <text start="35.91" dur="6.63">dot gov sites so they&amp;#39;re probably not</text>
  <text start="38.37" dur="5.939">that great anyway so 2380 to November</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="4.109">first and he hasn&amp;#39;t done anything since</text>
  <text start="44.309" dur="3.631">the 9th so it&amp;#39;s been quite a while and I</text>
  <text start="46.649" dur="2.941">know people have been very impatient</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ve had plenty to keep us busy</text>
  <text start="49.59" dur="4.469">I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;s what key was thinking as</text>
  <text start="51.87" dur="4.68">well or I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s an element of</text>
  <text start="54.059" dur="5.611">that in there we of course there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="56.55" dur="5.309">plan but he says do not let them divide</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="5.699">you together you were strong together</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="5.401">you win your vote in matters this is</text>
  <text start="65.369" dur="4.32">probably the first time any of us have</text>
  <text start="67.26" dur="4.02">ever actually heard that when it was</text>
  <text start="69.689" dur="2.301">real in the truth and usually they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="3.99">matter</text>
  <text start="71.99" dur="5.23">usually it&amp;#39;s all a rigged game because</text>
  <text start="75.27" dur="4.02">the corruption had seeped in so far</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="4.56">because the central bank had been able</text>
  <text start="79.29" dur="6.18">to control our money supply and use that</text>
  <text start="81.78" dur="6.93">to purchase all the power and all the</text>
  <text start="85.47" dur="4.62">people and all the things and we were</text>
  <text start="88.71" dur="3.81">just really seeing the late stages of</text>
  <text start="90.09" dur="5.52">that but now for the first time the vote</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="4.5">actually matters and as you guys may</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="4.799">know I&amp;#39;m a voluntary us</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.669">so coming from me that&amp;#39;s a lot I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="100.409" dur="4.35">like generally even believe in voting ok</text>
  <text start="102.689" dur="3.601">generally I believe that voting is a</text>
  <text start="104.759" dur="2.491">form of violence over other people</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="3.509">because at the end of the day you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="107.25" dur="4.35">kind of you&amp;#39;re sort of voting for people</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="3.96">to have authority to go and hurt people</text>
  <text start="111.6" dur="3.659">who don&amp;#39;t follow these rules you know</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="4.71">and I don&amp;#39;t agree with many of those</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="5.371">rules but in this case because of Trump</text>
  <text start="118.469" dur="5.61">because of what Q is doing we have seen</text>
  <text start="120.63" dur="5.61">things have changed a lot and in this</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="4.74">case there are really good guys in there</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="4.65">fighting for us fighting for freedom now</text>
  <text start="128.819" dur="4.791">he mentions to reread the drops about</text>
  <text start="130.89" dur="5.54">polls obviously</text>
  <text start="133.61" dur="5.28">he&amp;#39;s kind of bashed the the polls many</text>
  <text start="136.43" dur="5.82">times we all know the story though the</text>
  <text start="138.89" dur="6.03">whole Hillary&amp;#39;s got a 98% chance of</text>
  <text start="142.25" dur="5.64">winning or a 75 or an 80 or 90 or</text>
  <text start="144.92" dur="6.12">something like that Trump is like a 2%</text>
  <text start="147.89" dur="6.03">no way you know they were all so</text>
  <text start="151.04" dur="6.54">confident because they thought they had</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="6.14">it in the bag unfortunately it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="157.58" dur="4.62">different now but people don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="160.06" dur="3.28">especially people on the left they just</text>
  <text start="162.2" dur="3.3">seem to have forgotten all of those</text>
  <text start="163.34" dur="5.58">failed promises and false predictions</text>
  <text start="165.5" dur="4.89">now instead they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re playing the</text>
  <text start="168.92" dur="2.97">same game once again it&amp;#39;s their little</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="3.18">playbook that he was talked about in the</text>
  <text start="171.89" dur="4.83">past they have a they have a playbook</text>
  <text start="173.57" dur="4.41">and it&amp;#39;s not very big and they they kind</text>
  <text start="176.72" dur="3.75">of stick to it very well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="4.1">really used to having to think outside</text>
  <text start="180.47" dur="4.74">of that playbook or think defensively</text>
  <text start="182.08" dur="6.22">that&amp;#39;s what all of the craziness has</text>
  <text start="185.21" dur="4.53">been lately but he&amp;#39;s just bringing I</text>
  <text start="188.3" dur="2.88">guess attention back to the fact that</text>
  <text start="189.74" dur="3.51">these polls are completely inaccurate</text>
  <text start="191.18" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re over sampling Democrats</text>
  <text start="193.25" dur="3.84">dramatically according to many of these</text>
  <text start="194.84" dur="3.78">polls there&amp;#39;s only 25 percent of the</text>
  <text start="197.09" dur="3.72">people in the world are in the in the</text>
  <text start="198.62" dur="5.46">nation aren&amp;#39;t even Republican and yet we</text>
  <text start="200.81" dur="5.76">control everything so you know and I say</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="4.53">we because I do I consider myself part</text>
  <text start="206.57" dur="4.05">of that team I&amp;#39;m not a typical</text>
  <text start="208.61" dur="8.91">Republican I&amp;#39;m more of a conservative</text>
  <text start="210.62" dur="10.17">but continuing on 2383 so November 1st</text>
  <text start="217.52" dur="5.939">once again and this is an older post</text>
  <text start="220.79" dur="6.449">from July 29th and he&amp;#39;s posting an image</text>
  <text start="223.459" dur="6.381">of it 1751 and it was talking about a</text>
  <text start="227.239" dur="6.061">link from Real Clear Politics calm</text>
  <text start="229.84" dur="7.36">MSNBC&amp;#39;s Ali Velshi Apple and Google</text>
  <text start="233.3" dur="8.88">profiting from apps promoting I think</text>
  <text start="237.2" dur="7.11">that was about censorship I&amp;#39;m not sure</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="3.779">what that link was about they do not</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="3.12">want you asking questions they do not</text>
  <text start="245.959" dur="4.261">want you thinking for yourself they do</text>
  <text start="247.43" dur="5.25">not want you United they want you to</text>
  <text start="250.22" dur="5.31">live in fear and divided they want you</text>
  <text start="252.68" dur="6.32">asleep they want you blind the message</text>
  <text start="255.53" dur="6.42">must bypass the MSM it is the only way</text>
  <text start="259" dur="6.37">people United hold the power think</text>
  <text start="261.95" dur="4.71">election 2016 power shall be returned to</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="3.21">the people</text>
  <text start="266.66" dur="8.13">and then he had posted underneath that</text>
  <text start="268.58" dur="11.28">back in July every see blank a CIA slash</text>
  <text start="274.79" dur="7.17">Mossad MOS tactic of infiltration and</text>
  <text start="279.86" dur="5.3">internal disruption is being deployed on</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="5.64">this board central hub the world is here</text>
  <text start="285.16" dur="4.63">recognize this movement is bigger than</text>
  <text start="287.6" dur="5.7">anyone can possibly imagine peace their</text>
  <text start="289.79" dur="5.82">strength and then here he&amp;#39;s quoting it</text>
  <text start="293.3" dur="4.08">again today saying quote we have to</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="5.1">bypass the media in order to get this</text>
  <text start="297.38" dur="5.58">straight to the people quote we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="4.47">around them like no one in history has</text>
  <text start="302.96" dur="3.27">gone around them and this is from POTUS</text>
  <text start="305.18" dur="6.84">at tonight&amp;#39;s rally</text>
  <text start="306.23" dur="7.5">so of course Twitter comes to mind going</text>
  <text start="312.02" dur="4.35">around the msn that&amp;#39;s what many people</text>
  <text start="313.73" dur="5.37">will immediately default to but it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="316.37" dur="5.1">much more than that he&amp;#39;s also talking</text>
  <text start="319.1" dur="4.23">about queuing on I am fairly confident</text>
  <text start="321.47" dur="4.08">when I say that he&amp;#39;s also talking about</text>
  <text start="323.33" dur="3.69">queue because they that what they did is</text>
  <text start="325.55" dur="3.39">they disclosed a lot of information</text>
  <text start="327.02" dur="3.75">through queue through the Socratic</text>
  <text start="328.94" dur="2.88">method asking the right questions</text>
  <text start="330.77" dur="3.51">letting people piece it together</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="4.56">themselves with public data and publicly</text>
  <text start="334.28" dur="4.47">available information but piece it</text>
  <text start="336.38" dur="4.44">together nonetheless and now we have</text>
  <text start="338.75" dur="4.5">this amazing thing the citizen</text>
  <text start="340.82" dur="4.92">journalists combined with this massive</text>
  <text start="343.25" dur="6.09">think-tank of individuals out there as</text>
  <text start="345.74" dur="5.31">part of this group effort this volunteer</text>
  <text start="349.34" dur="4.02">coordinated effort to open-source</text>
  <text start="351.05" dur="5.18">investigate all of the deep states</text>
  <text start="353.36" dur="5.309">crimes and it has yielded such fruit</text>
  <text start="356.23" dur="4.24">that I would say that it&amp;#39;s probably a</text>
  <text start="358.669" dur="4.141">bigger deal than Twitter at this point a</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="4.74">lot bigger dill so yes there&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="362.81" dur="4.41">bit of him using Twitter to get around</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="4.77">the MSM but there&amp;#39;s a lot of him using</text>
  <text start="367.22" dur="4.41">queue to destroy the MSM credibility to</text>
  <text start="369.98" dur="4.62">organize a resistance and a push back</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="4.71">and everything else he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="374.6" dur="5.43">in these posts he finishes by saying</text>
  <text start="376.34" dur="6.3">think MSM attacks about hue we the</text>
  <text start="380.03" dur="5.4">people of course they&amp;#39;ve launched every</text>
  <text start="382.64" dur="6.06">attack about Q but there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="385.43" dur="4.739">talking about uniting people that is</text>
  <text start="388.7" dur="7.589">part of what&amp;#39;s necessary for this</text>
  <text start="390.169" dur="9.211">because you want a significant group to</text>
  <text start="396.289" dur="4.021">be very passionate and and active in</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="2.58">order to have the</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="5.07">kind of momentum politically that you</text>
  <text start="401.96" dur="5.04">need to enact great change that is true</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="4.2">of any leader throughout history ever</text>
  <text start="407" dur="6.63">it&amp;#39;s one of those just kind of rules</text>
  <text start="409.58" dur="5.91">that like gravity it&amp;#39;s difficult to</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="5.37">overturn an entrenched power base</text>
  <text start="415.49" dur="4.98">without power and the only thing they</text>
  <text start="419" dur="4.29">can really ultimately overthrow those</text>
  <text start="420.47" dur="4.47">entrenched systems other than a economic</text>
  <text start="423.29" dur="4.74">collapse and then someone else comes in</text>
  <text start="424.94" dur="6.68">and takes power in generally a strongman</text>
  <text start="428.03" dur="7.59">in those scenarios but rather than that</text>
  <text start="431.62" dur="5.89">you have this situation where someone</text>
  <text start="435.62" dur="4.2">like Trump a populist comes out of</text>
  <text start="437.51" dur="4.59">nowhere and gains great great great</text>
  <text start="439.82" dur="5.82">support among the people and he&amp;#39;s able</text>
  <text start="442.1" dur="6.27">to channel that energy into certain</text>
  <text start="445.64" dur="5.88">goals so that is what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="448.37" dur="6.27">seeing a majority of people maybe not</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="6.24">aware of Q but supporting Trump for a</text>
  <text start="454.64" dur="4.95">legitimate change and Q has a big part</text>
  <text start="457.76" dur="3.81">to play in that and those who have been</text>
  <text start="459.59" dur="4.92">part of this you know this group effort</text>
  <text start="461.57" dur="4.65">you know you guys are amazing and and</text>
  <text start="464.51" dur="3.06">what an exciting time to be alive and</text>
  <text start="466.22" dur="2.94">thank you</text>
  <text start="467.57" dur="3.12">but with that you guys have a wonderful</text>
  <text start="469.16" dur="4.44">evening stay tuned I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="470.69" dur="4.5">posting when it rains it pours with Q</text>
  <text start="473.6" dur="4.02">sometimes I don&amp;#39;t think these two posts</text>
  <text start="475.19" dur="3.75">will be the only thing we see of course</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="4.14">everything is going to get interesting</text>
  <text start="478.94" dur="4.32">now that the midterms are so close and I</text>
