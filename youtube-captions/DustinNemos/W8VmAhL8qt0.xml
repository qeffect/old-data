  <text start="49.05" dur="4.77">my head in the sand then I found out</text>
  <text start="51.21" dur="5.67">that power platers past lies for truth</text>
  <text start="53.82" dur="5.28">and truth for the lies especially in</text>
  <text start="56.88" dur="5.25">areas of life and hell I used to stay</text>
  <text start="59.1" dur="5.76">quiet and now I speak up a red pill my</text>

  <text start="75.179" dur="8.661">attacks on your health it&amp;#39;s red pill</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="6.35">living calm wake up stand up speak up</text>
  <text start="87.68" dur="5.799">alright so starting off this is already</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="4.95">pretty darn scary here I mean Obama has</text>
  <text start="93.479" dur="4.68">done so much damage to our to our</text>
  <text start="96.27" dur="4.639">nation&amp;#39;s fabric I mean he was basically</text>
  <text start="98.159" dur="5.64">a traitor Manchurian Candidate for</text>
  <text start="100.909" dur="6.28">possibly even the Iranian mullahs but it</text>
  <text start="103.799" dur="6">certainly some Islamic faction now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="107.189" dur="5.941">passed out billions of dollars through</text>
  <text start="109.799" dur="5.761">you know excuses like calling it a trade</text>
  <text start="113.13" dur="4.65">for some of our prisoners of war and</text>
  <text start="115.56" dur="4.53">captured fats and such but he made some</text>
  <text start="117.78" dur="5.549">very questionable trades in order to</text>
  <text start="120.09" dur="5.13">line the pockets of some very bad people</text>
  <text start="123.329" dur="4.32">and that would probably include himself</text>
  <text start="125.22" dur="4.14">you know he&amp;#39;s getting a percentage of</text>
  <text start="127.649" dur="5.31">this on the back end most likely and</text>
  <text start="129.36" dur="5.939">then he offers obama-biden all actually</text>
  <text start="132.959" dur="4.56">offers obama i supreme court nomination</text>
  <text start="135.299" dur="4.111">if he&amp;#39;d take it yes Wow</text>
  <text start="137.519" dur="4.351">so we&amp;#39;re gonna get this not a</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="5.969">constitutional expert supposedly</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="5.459">constitutional expert Barack Obama who</text>
  <text start="145.379" dur="4.95">has no respect for the US Constitution</text>
  <text start="147.329" dur="5.16">or people who&amp;#39;s secretly a Muslim and</text>
  <text start="150.329" dur="4.651">that&amp;#39;s been proven in the past where</text>
  <text start="152.489" dur="4.411">he&amp;#39;s even admitted it himself you know</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="3.629">you&amp;#39;ll see him slip up and say my my</text>
  <text start="156.9" dur="4.02">Muslim fate instead of his Christian</text>
  <text start="158.609" dur="4.801">faith you&amp;#39;ll slip up and say my Michael</text>
  <text start="160.92" dur="5.189">instead of Michelle he&amp;#39;s not actually</text>
  <text start="163.41" dur="5.669">that bright away from a teleprompter but</text>
  <text start="166.109" dur="4.891">he is very controlled even from birth he</text>
  <text start="169.079" dur="5.22">grew up in the clown you know the CIA</text>
  <text start="171" dur="5.28">world so definitely not a good situation</text>
  <text start="174.299" dur="3.75">for us to have him on the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="176.28" dur="3.959">by any means he would be the worst</text>
  <text start="178.049" dur="4.5">candidate he&amp;#39;d be as bad as Hillary but</text>
  <text start="180.239" dur="4.201">maybe this isn&amp;#39;t about really just</text>
  <text start="182.549" dur="4.351">getting him on the court perhaps it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="4.409">way to protect him from what they see as</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="4.169">justice coming his way</text>
  <text start="188.849" dur="3.961">be a little harder to arrest a Supreme</text>
  <text start="191.069" dur="4.441">Court justice than a private citizen</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="5.789">right so that&amp;#39;s what a biden is trying</text>
  <text start="195.51" dur="5.37">to do here is to try to find power and</text>
  <text start="198.599" dur="4.98">protection for some of his cronies if he</text>
  <text start="200.88" dur="4.68">wins but that will never happen we also</text>
  <text start="203.579" dur="3.63">have by the way you guys know that</text>
  <text start="205.56" dur="4.079">there&amp;#39;s quite a few thousands and</text>
  <text start="207.209" dur="3.9">thousands of daca recipients who are</text>
  <text start="209.639" dur="3.451">basically here calling themselves</text>
  <text start="211.109" dur="3.99">dreamers some of them are 30-plus old</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="4.829">felons and rapists and things of that</text>
  <text start="215.099" dur="4.741">nature so there are quite a few people</text>
  <text start="217.919" dur="2.941">in this category incredibly high rates</text>
  <text start="219.84" dur="3.06">of crime</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="4.32">and yet they have never been kicked out</text>
  <text start="222.9" dur="5.49">of the home that they violated and and</text>
  <text start="225.18" dur="5.91">came to so you know that&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="5.34">change the ice immigrations and customs</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="5.19">enforcement people are now beginning the</text>
  <text start="233.73" dur="5.16">process of deporting daca recipients</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="5.52">this is nationwide and they&amp;#39;re starting</text>
  <text start="238.89" dur="5.19">to undo some of the and I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="241.8" dur="3.84">called legislative holds but the courts</text>
  <text start="244.08" dur="3.54">basically put on some of these daca</text>
  <text start="245.64" dur="3.96">recipients because the judges knew that</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="3.81">you know they had been given a temporary</text>
  <text start="249.6" dur="3.66">reprieve and there was no point trying</text>
  <text start="251.43" dur="4.23">the case but that is a temporary</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="4.289">situation and now those old cases are</text>
  <text start="255.66" dur="3.93">going to be tried doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="257.549" dur="3.66">be you know deported immediately but</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="3.15">they will have to have a fair trial and</text>
  <text start="261.209" dur="3.511">a fair hearing and the merits of the</text>
  <text start="262.74" dur="3.12">case will have to be on their side you</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="2.16">know and I imagine there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="265.86" dur="2.55">quite a few of them that have been</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="4.68">nothing but trouble who were going to be</text>
  <text start="268.41" dur="4.95">going now now that&amp;#39;s so interesting and</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="3.63">and very powerful step you didn&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="273.36" dur="4.14">much about most likely while all the</text>
  <text start="275.19" dur="5.64">other drama was happening we also have</text>
  <text start="277.5" dur="5.43">US forces arrive in the in at the</text>
  <text start="280.83" dur="4.44">Embassy in Baghdad to stop the attack</text>
  <text start="282.93" dur="5.46">and this as Trump is threatening not</text>
  <text start="285.27" dur="4.77">Iraq but Iran the Iranian mullahs I</text>
  <text start="288.39" dur="3.6">think actually even responded saying</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;re you you can&amp;#39;t do anything or</text>
  <text start="291.99" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s nothing you can do or something</text>
  <text start="293.37" dur="4.68">like that and you know president Trump</text>
  <text start="296.07" dur="3.81">basically said I don&amp;#39;t remember the</text>
  <text start="298.05" dur="4.44">exact quote actually you know it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="299.88" dur="5.52">right here this is not a warning it is a</text>
  <text start="302.49" dur="6.15">threat you know Iran will pay a very big</text>
  <text start="305.4" dur="5.76">price for embassy attack so this is the</text>
  <text start="308.64" dur="3.69">kind of thing that a real leader would</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="4.95">have done he would have responded</text>
  <text start="312.33" dur="6.93">quickly to protect American citizens not</text>
  <text start="316.11" dur="5.34">like Obama and Hillary did so not a</text>
  <text start="319.26" dur="4.29">Benghazi moment in fact it&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="321.45" dur="4.17">chance for President Trump to shine and</text>
  <text start="323.55" dur="4.89">to in the support of military who know</text>
  <text start="325.62" dur="4.65">he has their back now we also have newly</text>
  <text start="328.44" dur="4.11">released FOIA documents revealing that</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="4.97">former FBI chief Andrew McCabe you guys</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="4.56">remember old Andy McCabe lied to the FBI</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="5.44">investigators on his leaking to the</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="5.07">media so he was the one leaking</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="4.13">information to the Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="342.18" dur="6.92">in the final weeks of the 2016 election</text>
  <text start="344.81" dur="6.79">this liar right here he&amp;#39;s in trouble so</text>
  <text start="349.1" dur="4.22">potential criminal prosecution for</text>
  <text start="351.6" dur="5.92">changing this story</text>
  <text start="353.32" dur="5.67">let&amp;#39;s see the quote here quote The Daily</text>

  <text start="358.99" dur="3.87">Andrew McCabe faced scorching criticism</text>
  <text start="361.18" dur="3.81">and potential criminal prosecution for</text>
  <text start="362.86" dur="4.44">changing his story about a conversation</text>
  <text start="364.99" dur="4.89">he had with a Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="367.3" dur="4.08">reporter now newly released interview</text>
  <text start="369.88" dur="3.69">transcripts show McCabe expressed</text>
  <text start="371.38" dur="4.19">remorse to internal FBI investigators</text>
  <text start="373.57" dur="4.65">when they pressed him on the about-face</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="4.75">the FBI released the documents in</text>
  <text start="378.22" dur="5.22">response to a Freedom of Information Act</text>

  <text start="391.39" dur="2.7">the Journal</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="4.74">McCabe&amp;#39;s role in it and the reaction of</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="4.47">agents who investigated it in the final</text>
  <text start="396.7" dur="4.44">weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign</text>
  <text start="398.56" dur="5.64">the journal broke news about an FBI</text>

  <text start="404.2" dur="4.35">Hillary Clinton describing internal</text>
  <text start="406.45" dur="4.71">discussions among senior FBI officials</text>
  <text start="408.55" dur="4.41">the apparently drew scrutiny from the</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="4.77">bureau&amp;#39;s internal investigation team</text>
  <text start="412.96" dur="6.03">which interviewed McCabe on May 9th 2017</text>
  <text start="415.93" dur="5.97">the day President Trump fired James</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="4.59">Comey from his post as FBI director the</text>
  <text start="421.9" dur="3.54">agents interviewed him as part of an</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="3.57">investigation regarding a different</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="4.35">media leak to the online publication</text>
  <text start="427.15" dur="5.07">circa and also asked him about the</text>
  <text start="429.79" dur="4.23">journal story in that interview McCabe</text>
  <text start="432.22" dur="4.68">said he did not know how the journal</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="4.77">Cain story came to be but a few months</text>
  <text start="436.9" dur="4.95">later his story changed after he</text>
  <text start="438.79" dur="4.41">interviewed or he reviewed his answer so</text>
  <text start="441.85" dur="3.48">that&amp;#39;s very interesting he knowingly</text>
  <text start="443.2" dur="4.59">lied about his role in leaking documents</text>
  <text start="445.33" dur="4.35">to The Wall Street Journal and as they</text>
  <text start="447.79" dur="3.69">point out here Roger stone is looking at</text>
  <text start="449.68" dur="5.75">the rest of his life in prison for less</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="7.17">than this now many people are fleeing</text>
  <text start="455.43" dur="4.66">California as a state and we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="458.65" dur="3.81">about this before as well many people</text>
  <text start="460.09" dur="4.68">are heading out for various reasons you</text>
  <text start="462.46" dur="4.08">know the economy the the culture the the</text>
  <text start="464.77" dur="5.34">tyranny the corruption the forced</text>
  <text start="466.54" dur="7.53">vaccines you know the the just the the</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="5.73">border basically being an open sieve</text>
  <text start="474.07" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s just leaking constantly into</text>
  <text start="475.84" dur="4.47">their into their state from Mexico and</text>
  <text start="478.12" dur="3.6">South America so you know we&amp;#39;re seeing a</text>
  <text start="480.31" dur="2.85">lot of people and a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="481.72" dur="2.88">illegal immigrants as well by the way</text>
  <text start="483.16" dur="2.979">but a lot of them are just leaving</text>
  <text start="484.6" dur="3.689">California for greener pastures</text>
  <text start="486.139" dur="4.71">trying to find somewhere better and</text>
  <text start="488.289" dur="4.06">California itself which has been taking</text>
  <text start="490.849" dur="3.301">advantage of these illegal immigrant</text>
  <text start="492.349" dur="3.991">numbers to swell their own ranks in</text>
  <text start="494.15" dur="4.41">Congress and get more seats are now</text>
  <text start="496.34" dur="4.139">looking at the opposite effect it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="498.56" dur="4.109">gonna be very interesting because in New</text>
  <text start="500.479" dur="4.65">York and California they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="502.669" dur="4.921">looking at losing seats as they read</text>
  <text start="505.129" dur="3.75">istrict and as people are of course</text>
  <text start="507.59" dur="3.12">moving away from them they&amp;#39;re losing</text>
  <text start="508.879" dur="4.47">numbers and head counts or a big part of</text>
  <text start="510.71" dur="5.34">how you get some of those seats because</text>
  <text start="513.349" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s how our Constitution works it&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="516.05" dur="3.299">don&amp;#39;t know the exact rule but it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="517.339" dur="3.81">portioned based off the the census and</text>
  <text start="519.349" dur="3.841">the population and the head counts so</text>
  <text start="521.149" dur="5.281">you know larger cities do have more</text>
  <text start="523.19" dur="5.88">voices than smaller states even so that</text>
  <text start="526.43" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s important to understand at least</text>
  <text start="529.07" dur="3.269">that that&amp;#39;s an an idea you know</text>
  <text start="530.72" dur="3.15">somewhere like in New York is gonna have</text>
  <text start="532.339" dur="6.69">more of a voting poll than somewhere</text>
  <text start="533.87" dur="7.469">like in Idaho now continuing on ello and</text>
  <text start="539.029" dur="4.461">by the way a OC is on that list who she</text>
  <text start="541.339" dur="6.031">may lose her seat as they redistricting</text>
  <text start="543.49" dur="7.599">kind of funny digenova says come--and</text>
  <text start="547.37" dur="7.62">britain with who leaders wow that is</text>
  <text start="551.089" dur="5.521">important quote coup leaders so of</text>
  <text start="554.99" dur="2.94">course call me and mccabe were kind of</text>
  <text start="556.61" dur="3.06">my first guess for the ones that would</text>
  <text start="557.93" dur="3.63">be arrested first but Brennan is on that</text>
  <text start="559.67" dur="4.169">list you know he&amp;#39;s not too far behind to</text>
  <text start="561.56" dur="4.5">call me different heads of different</text>
  <text start="563.839" dur="4.651">branches but both involved and the CIA</text>
  <text start="566.06" dur="4.5">way worse than the FBI ever thought</text>
  <text start="568.49" dur="3.57">about being we&amp;#39;re only starting to hear</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="3.899">about what the FBI are doing to Tromp</text>
  <text start="572.06" dur="3.779">right that doesn&amp;#39;t even include what the</text>

  <text start="732.59" dur="3.63">well they&amp;#39;ve certainly had mass layoffs</text>
  <text start="734.12" dur="5.52">already at places like BuzzFeed</text>
  <text start="736.22" dur="6.84">20:19 saw nearly 8,000 layoffs which is</text>
  <text start="739.64" dur="4.74">almost double for the fake news so this</text>
  <text start="743.06" dur="3.3">is very interesting and I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="744.38" dur="3.06">winning the war they&amp;#39;re having massive</text>
  <text start="746.36" dur="2.7">layoffs because they&amp;#39;re losing millions</text>

  <text start="751.52" dur="3.599">big tack and fake news means that</text>
  <text start="753.529" dur="3.87">with censorship we can&amp;#39;t even earn a</text>

  <text start="759.109" dur="3.72">makes a lot more money than any of us I</text>
  <text start="761.269" dur="3.66">think I make point zero zero eight</text>

  <text start="764.929" dur="4.8">a good year right and and I do the same</text>
  <text start="767.959" dur="4.14">job basically as he does and I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="769.729" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t lie to you the way he does so I</text>
  <text start="772.099" dur="4.68">think that kind of the corruption is not</text>
  <text start="774.859" dur="3.63">paying as much as it used to clearly</text>
  <text start="776.779" dur="4.26">with the Clinton Foundation&amp;#39;s income</text>

  <text start="784.509" dur="4.36">usefulness and utility are fading</text>
  <text start="787.22" dur="4.289">because their words their propaganda and</text>
  <text start="788.869" dur="5.52">their lies are fading so tyrants will be</text>
  <text start="791.509" dur="4.97">looking to other other things as well</text>
  <text start="794.389" dur="4.29">kind of like going back over here to</text>
  <text start="796.479" dur="5.32">disarmament I mean that&amp;#39;s pretty insane</text>

  <text start="803.749" dur="4.471">you&amp;#39;re seeing Orthodox Jews actually</text>

  <text start="815.119" dur="6.24">Muslims probably voting Democrat or</text>
  <text start="818.119" dur="5.04">attacking Jewish people with machetes</text>
  <text start="821.359" dur="3.361">and stuff and you know they&amp;#39;ll break</text>
  <text start="823.159" dur="5.34">into churches and try to attack</text>
  <text start="824.72" dur="9.029">Christians as well but there&amp;#39;s a a anti</text>

  <text start="833.749" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s a big part maybe the biggest part</text>
  <text start="835.759" dur="5.43">of our terrorist attacks is these you</text>
  <text start="837.829" dur="5.37">know this cultural aggressiveness Sharia</text>

  <text start="843.199" dur="3.78">reallyl &amp;#39;m you know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="845.389" dur="2.88">basically there to invade you there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="846.979" dur="3.36">the house of war there&amp;#39;s the house of</text>
  <text start="848.269" dur="3.24">Islam you get to pick one which are you</text>
  <text start="850.339" dur="3.99">going to be and if you&amp;#39;re in the house</text>
  <text start="851.509" dur="4.62">of war you&amp;#39;re meant to be enslaved and</text>
  <text start="854.329" dur="4.32">destroyed because you&amp;#39;re not a Muslim</text>
  <text start="856.129" dur="4.471">right so that&amp;#39;s how it works</text>
  <text start="858.649" dur="3.81">unfortunately and that&amp;#39;s you know kind</text>
  <text start="860.6" dur="4.169">of where we need to see Islam reformed</text>
  <text start="862.459" dur="4.44">so you&amp;#39;re starting to see you know it</text>
  <text start="864.769" dur="4.74">divided between the Jew and these and</text>
  <text start="866.899" dur="5.01">the Muslim for the Left Party the</text>
  <text start="869.509" dur="4.25">Democrats and that is a very big deal</text>
  <text start="871.909" dur="4.58">you know that&amp;#39;s a big deal for their</text>
  <text start="873.759" dur="5.2">ability to go forward I do think that</text>
  <text start="876.489" dur="4.03">Democrats will be a regional party or</text>
  <text start="878.959" dur="5.63">many I think it&amp;#39;s called a municipal</text>
  <text start="880.519" dur="6.421">party soon rather than a national party</text>
  <text start="884.589" dur="4.841">speaking of guns</text>
  <text start="886.94" dur="4.29">Communist China is not happy about gun</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="5.34">ownership thinks it&amp;#39;s a serious problem</text>
  <text start="891.23" dur="5.76">that must change in the United States in</text>
  <text start="894.77" dur="3.51">fact they&amp;#39;re very upset about it</text>
  <text start="896.99" dur="4.08">probably because they could easily</text>
  <text start="898.28" dur="5.28">invade with the numbers that they have</text>
  <text start="901.07" dur="3.75">at the United States they&amp;#39;d love to take</text>
  <text start="903.56" dur="2.94">it over and take our land everything</text>
  <text start="904.82" dur="3.63">else but there&amp;#39;s no way in hell that</text>
  <text start="906.5" dur="4.68">would work just like the Japanese</text>
  <text start="908.45" dur="5.19">general told the Emperor of Japan before</text>
  <text start="911.18" dur="4.35">they invaded you should not invade the</text>
  <text start="913.64" dur="3.44">u.s. there would be a gun hiding behind</text>
  <text start="915.53" dur="3.72">every blade of grass</text>
  <text start="917.08" dur="4.39">there&amp;#39;s my little one she&amp;#39;s awake and</text>
  <text start="919.25" dur="3.96">yeah I mean he was absolutely right</text>
  <text start="921.47" dur="3.93">there would be a gun hiding behind every</text>
  <text start="923.21" dur="3.78">blade of grass if China invaded I would</text>
  <text start="925.4" dur="3.6">be behind quite a few blades of grass</text>
  <text start="926.99" dur="3.99">myself just like everyone else here that</text>
  <text start="929" dur="4.26">has the ability to go out and defend</text>
  <text start="930.98" dur="5.55">their their nation we don&amp;#39;t need a</text>
  <text start="933.26" dur="4.98">military to do that and in fact folks I</text>
  <text start="936.53" dur="4.44">not many people out here know this but</text>
  <text start="938.24" dur="5.58">if you&amp;#39;ve researched tactics and you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="940.97" dur="4.59">researched military strategy there is</text>
  <text start="943.82" dur="4.55">actually an aspect to this that would</text>
  <text start="945.56" dur="5.25">make it almost impossible to take over a</text>
  <text start="948.37" dur="5.59">decentralized people that were armed and</text>
  <text start="950.81" dur="5.46">resisting no military can really do that</text>
  <text start="953.96" dur="4.05">very well it&amp;#39;s too expensive it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="956.27" dur="4.68">make sense long term and eventually</text>
  <text start="958.01" dur="8.52">you&amp;#39;ll have breakdowns so you know you</text>
  <text start="960.95" dur="8.55">can&amp;#39;t occupy a resistant population for</text>
  <text start="966.53" dur="3.96">an unlimited amount of time even if</text>
  <text start="969.5" dur="2.34">you&amp;#39;re going through all the worst</text>
  <text start="970.49" dur="4.38">hearings and stuff eventually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="971.84" dur="5.34">gonna beat that army so what you want to</text>
  <text start="974.87" dur="3.84">do is have a government in place with</text>
  <text start="977.18" dur="2.79">like a president that you can take over</text>
  <text start="978.71" dur="3.18">and say here&amp;#39;s what you do from now on</text>
  <text start="979.97" dur="4.65">and the government enforces it on it the</text>
  <text start="981.89" dur="4.5">people but if there were a situation</text>
  <text start="984.62" dur="3.69">where there was no government like they</text>
  <text start="986.39" dur="3.72">had invaded and beaten our military or</text>
  <text start="988.31" dur="4.38">something but the people themselves</text>
  <text start="990.11" dur="5.43">still had guns we would eventually beat</text>
  <text start="992.69" dur="5.7">the military most of the time so barring</text>
  <text start="995.54" dur="4.56">something extraordinary happening the it</text>
  <text start="998.39" dur="5.16">would be much more difficult to take out</text>
  <text start="1000.1" dur="5.04">or to take over a armed population which</text>
  <text start="1003.55" dur="5.85">of course the founding fathers knew this</text>
  <text start="1005.14" dur="5.79">it was a it was a it was put into place</text>
  <text start="1009.4" dur="3.9">a second amendment to protect us not</text>
  <text start="1010.93" dur="4.23">only from foreign enemies of course that</text>
  <text start="1013.3" dur="4.26">was the key word foreign enemies but</text>
  <text start="1015.16" dur="5.16">also domestic because having weapons</text>
  <text start="1017.56" dur="4.38">protect you from people</text>
  <text start="1020.32" dur="3.54">and the left just does not understand</text>
  <text start="1021.94" dur="4.53">this even though we we keep having</text>
  <text start="1023.86" dur="4.44">incidents we&amp;#39;re good guys with guns stop</text>
