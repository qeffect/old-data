  <text start="179.64" dur="5.19">did no there&amp;#39;s the appeal that was</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="4.71">pending there&amp;#39;s the fact that he some</text>
  <text start="184.83" dur="5.34">people pointed out he did not look like</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="6.6">he had been strangled at all through</text>
  <text start="190.17" dur="4.349">through hanging one reporter even had</text>

  <text start="198.75" dur="5.4">at all or purplish and you know from</text>
  <text start="201.08" dur="4.24">asphyxiation or whatever so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="204.15" dur="1.77">lot of things that just doesn&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="205.32" dur="2.31">sense</text>
  <text start="205.92" dur="5.64">some people say witness protection</text>
  <text start="207.63" dur="5.37">program sure but you know sb2 also told</text>
  <text start="211.56" dur="7.41">us that chemtrails were stopped and I</text>
  <text start="213" dur="8.489">don&amp;#39;t really see that yet you know we</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t I see it as a negative</text>
  <text start="221.489" dur="4.53">his whether he&amp;#39;s in witness protection</text>
  <text start="223.53" dur="5.519">program for some mysterious reason may</text>
  <text start="226.019" dur="5.071">be trying to keep him alive which may be</text>
  <text start="229.049" dur="3.751">but you you pay a heavy price because</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="3.31">you let down a lot of people that think</text>
  <text start="232.8" dur="3.909">wow we almost had a time</text>
  <text start="234.4" dur="3.66">a chance for justice here and now people</text>
  <text start="236.709" dur="2.731">are going to basically say in their</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="3.36">minds you know the truth or is going to</text>
  <text start="239.44" dur="5.84">think we can&amp;#39;t even keep witnesses alive</text>
  <text start="241.42" dur="3.86">how we ever get justice</text>
  <text start="276.18" dur="4.84">anyway I was just kind of droning on</text>
  <text start="278.92" dur="5.21">about how I was very impressed with</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="5.1">President Trump on the retweeting of</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="3.91">some of the things that he&amp;#39;s done lately</text>
  <text start="286.12" dur="4.59">like of course a while back he put out</text>
  <text start="288.04" dur="4.29">the the meme of the Idol theme shared it</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="3.51">directly but he Reshard someone who</text>
  <text start="292.33" dur="4.44">shared it the meme of some of the deep</text>
  <text start="294.22" dur="4.56">state conspirators behind bars you know</text>
  <text start="296.77" dur="3.42">and he&amp;#39;s used words like trait traitor</text>
  <text start="298.78" dur="3.42">and treason in the past and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.19" dur="4.56">starting to kind of build and now he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.2" dur="4.77">even putting out or again re sharing</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="3.87">other people who did social media</text>
  <text start="306.97" dur="3.66">influencers who did so that they can</text>
  <text start="308.62" dur="4.23">kind of tell the full truth and he just</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="5.58">reshares it but britain clinton crime</text>
  <text start="312.85" dur="4.56">family you know there was another one on</text>
  <text start="316.21" dur="6.42">there can&amp;#39;t remember all the time I had</text>
  <text start="317.41" dur="8.88">but Clinton body count and Clinton crime</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="5.79">family that was the two and from that</text>
  <text start="326.29" dur="5.52">that from the President of the US I mean</text>
  <text start="328.42" dur="8.13">I was on his tweet that&amp;#39;s a big red pill</text>
  <text start="331.81" dur="7.05">right so yeah my my thing on Epstein is</text>
  <text start="336.55" dur="4.56">still it looks like we can&amp;#39;t keep victim</text>
  <text start="338.86" dur="6.03">well not victims but witnesses alive</text>
  <text start="341.11" dur="6.12">long enough to actually testifying which</text>
  <text start="344.89" dur="8.4">doesn&amp;#39;t look good I think it&amp;#39;s a bad</text>
  <text start="347.23" dur="11.13">morale thing either way but I love his</text>
  <text start="353.29" dur="9.75">response and you know red flag laws I do</text>
  <text start="358.36" dur="7.38">not support them I mean the idea sounds</text>
  <text start="363.04" dur="6.27">great let&amp;#39;s not let crazy people get</text>
  <text start="365.74" dur="5.31">guns what happens when someone say for</text>
  <text start="369.31" dur="3.78">example a left-leaning bureaucratic</text>
  <text start="371.05" dur="5.43">government employee decides that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="373.09" dur="5.76">crazy because you support Trump right</text>
  <text start="376.48" dur="5.28">like it&amp;#39;s all subjective and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="378.85" dur="4.23">basically kind of like that old famous</text>
  <text start="381.76" dur="5.01">quote I can&amp;#39;t remember who it was that</text>
  <text start="383.08" dur="5.31">said crazy has always been what popular</text>
  <text start="386.77" dur="4.02">culture and those in power have deemed</text>
  <text start="388.39" dur="4.5">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s true or not so</text>
  <text start="390.79" dur="4.95">ice on the you know the the</text>
  <text start="392.89" dur="6">truth-telling side of things get hurt</text>
  <text start="395.74" dur="6.63">the hardest with laws like that</text>
  <text start="398.89" dur="5.16">there&amp;#39;s also abuse for like you know for</text>
  <text start="402.37" dur="3.51">example your ex-girlfriend wants to get</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="4.23">back at you and says you&amp;#39;re crazy and</text>
  <text start="405.88" dur="5.7">you&amp;#39;re violent crazy with a gun</text>
  <text start="408.28" dur="4.89">or some lefty wants to punish you for</text>
  <text start="411.58" dur="3.36">being a gun owner because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="413.17" dur="3.33">believe that you should own it so they</text>
  <text start="414.94" dur="3.36">master flag you the way that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="416.5" dur="5.13">been doing you know on our posts and</text>
  <text start="418.3" dur="4.98">stuff that&amp;#39;s what they do so a red flag</text>
  <text start="421.63" dur="3.03">law could never work it just gives the</text>
  <text start="423.28" dur="6.29">government more power that they would</text>
  <text start="424.66" dur="8.43">then inevitably abuse an hour later a</text>
  <text start="429.57" dur="6.37">Chan is still down to be fair I have</text>
  <text start="433.09" dur="5.91">offered a solution Roy it&amp;#39;s good to see</text>
  <text start="435.94" dur="6.27">you all can a Turkish EU I have offered</text>
  <text start="439" dur="4.8">a solution to code monkey they know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="442.21" dur="2.43">sure that they have it all in hand I</text>
  <text start="443.8" dur="2.16">don&amp;#39;t know how long it takes to</text>
  <text start="444.64" dur="3.54">implement because I&amp;#39;m not a tech person</text>
  <text start="445.96" dur="3.84">but I put them in touch with the right</text>
  <text start="448.18" dur="5.55">people to get a replacement for</text>
  <text start="449.8" dur="5.16">CloudFlare so we&amp;#39;ll see I even offered</text>
  <text start="453.73" dur="3.51">to try to help fund it I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="454.96" dur="3.66">have anything left but you know if they</text>
  <text start="457.24" dur="11.25">need funds I&amp;#39;m sure we could do a</text>
  <text start="458.62" dur="11.25">crowdfunding from the community yeah</text>
  <text start="468.49" dur="5.6">that some states have them already and</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="4.22">those states are already seeing abuses</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="3.73">unfortunately and some people have died</text>
  <text start="477.19" dur="6.56">remember this some people have actually</text>
  <text start="478.66" dur="5.09">died defending their right from this</text>
  <text start="483.85" dur="3.18">from this unconstitutional gun grab</text>
  <text start="485.92" dur="2.52">which is kind of what it is I mean</text>
  <text start="487.03" dur="3.15">really if you&amp;#39;re a if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="488.44" dur="4.64">constitutionalist and a purist this is</text>
  <text start="490.18" dur="6.84">this is a this is the line in the sand</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="6.34">for a small population or a small</text>
  <text start="497.02" dur="4.4">section of the population right they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="499.42" dur="4.11">just gonna go down with their gun rights</text>
  <text start="501.42" dur="4.18">they&amp;#39;re not gonna decide to just give up</text>
  <text start="503.53" dur="3.57">their guns for some arbitrary you know</text>
  <text start="505.6" dur="4.23">arbitrary reasons someone decided that</text>
  <text start="507.1" dur="4.77">they didn&amp;#39;t like them that day or they</text>
  <text start="509.83" dur="3.63">struck someone as rude or something or</text>
  <text start="511.87" dur="4.47">they were in the wrong political group</text>
  <text start="513.46" dur="5.49">or something that day and what that does</text>
  <text start="516.34" dur="4.62">is it marginalizes otherwise law-abiding</text>
  <text start="518.95" dur="4.8">citizens that are good constitutionalist</text>
  <text start="520.96" dur="5.1">people and it turns the rest of the</text>
  <text start="523.75" dur="7.5">country against good people in a small</text>
  <text start="526.06" dur="8.49">group and then it also actually will of</text>
  <text start="531.25" dur="4.86">course over time dilute your group</text>
  <text start="534.55" dur="3.71">because you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re just ganging up on</text>
  <text start="536.11" dur="4.35">the the most pure part of it each time</text>
  <text start="538.26" dur="5.83">so it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re eating your elders</text>
  <text start="540.46" dur="8.01">almost in a sense and that&amp;#39;s a problem</text>
  <text start="544.09" dur="9.48">so we have to actually start pushing</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="8.7">back for gun rights instead of giving up</text>
  <text start="553.57" dur="6.24">ground each time on everything just no</text>
  <text start="557.17" dur="5.69">matter how obnoxious it is if you want</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="6.84">to have the right to have a tank shaped</text>
  <text start="562.86" dur="6.51">mailbox that fires fireworks on the</text>
  <text start="566.65" dur="6.32">fourth of July you should have the right</text>
