  <text start="122.689" dur="6.661">over this tweet that has apparently been</text>
  <text start="126.259" dur="5.191">ripped apart completely by the media and</text>
  <text start="129.35" dur="5.73">totally mischaracterized in my opinion</text>
  <text start="131.45" dur="6.81">so not only are elected officials</text>
  <text start="135.08" dur="5.19">claiming that this is racist but the</text>
  <text start="138.26" dur="4.65">media is taking off with that idea and</text>
  <text start="140.27" dur="6.96">they&amp;#39;re perpetuating that so normally I</text>
  <text start="142.91" dur="6.81">don&amp;#39;t really talk about the he-said</text>

  <text start="160.84" dur="7.03">nonsense but I really wanted to</text>
  <text start="164.42" dur="7.289">demonstrate here how much they twist</text>
  <text start="167.87" dur="8.27">these words and how ignorant they really</text>
  <text start="171.709" dur="9.841">are in interpreting what is being said</text>
  <text start="176.14" dur="6.64">so this is the actual tweet and I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="243.62" dur="7.95">really is sarcasm this entire thing was</text>
  <text start="248.78" dur="4.11">meant to be sarcastic and a lot of times</text>
  <text start="251.57" dur="4.639">when you&amp;#39;re being sarcastic</text>
  <text start="252.89" dur="9">you don&amp;#39;t necessarily name the person</text>
  <text start="256.209" dur="8.321">who you are talking about and usually in</text>

  <text start="271.13" dur="5.88">really it&amp;#39;s not you&amp;#39;re not able to</text>
  <text start="275.21" dur="4.32">really single out who you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="277.01" dur="3.24">about however the person who you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="279.53" dur="3.34">talking about</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="4.27">in this sarcastic statement</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="4.92">usually when you&amp;#39;re making a sarcastic</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="5.79">statement the person only the person who</text>
  <text start="287.79" dur="4.37">is being talked about they&amp;#39;re the ones</text>
  <text start="290.31" dur="4.46">who know that you&amp;#39;re talking about them</text>
  <text start="292.16" dur="5.08">they know that you&amp;#39;re talking about that</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="7.62">you don&amp;#39;t even have to say their name</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="10.98">they know it so really this tweet is not</text>
  <text start="302.39" dur="11.71">directed at Alexandria Acacio Cortes or</text>
  <text start="308.22" dur="11.58">what she did the lead or Ayane it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="314.1" dur="7.49">it&amp;#39;s directed at Ilhan Omar he knows</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="5.55">where these people came from</text>
  <text start="321.59" dur="5.83">Ilhan Omar is the only one out of those</text>
  <text start="325.35" dur="3.9">four who came from a different country</text>
  <text start="327.42" dur="7.55">she literally came from another country</text>
  <text start="329.25" dur="8.88">and by the way she was able to stay by</text>
  <text start="334.97" dur="5.2">really cheating the immigration system</text>
  <text start="338.13" dur="5.25">but we&amp;#39;re not going to get into that</text>
  <text start="340.17" dur="5.1">right now but the fact of the matter is</text>
  <text start="343.38" dur="3.57">is he&amp;#39;s not talking about those other</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="4.56">ones but of course they like to lump</text>
  <text start="346.95" dur="5.22">themselves in together as a kind of unit</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="6.15">and then so they&amp;#39;re trying to say that</text>
  <text start="352.17" dur="7.26">this tweet is completely racist it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="355.98" dur="11.25">racist because it&amp;#39;s not against all four</text>
  <text start="359.43" dur="10.83">of them it&amp;#39;s not okay he mentioned</text>
  <text start="367.23" dur="5.87">things that were very specific that</text>
  <text start="370.26" dur="10.2">could only be attributed to Ilhan Omar</text>
  <text start="373.1" dur="10.93">because she she&amp;#39;s Somalian okay she did</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="7.02">come from somewhere that is completely a</text>
  <text start="384.03" dur="6.6">disaster so he&amp;#39;s saying here is that you</text>
  <text start="387.48" dur="5.91">know while she trashes the US the United</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="7.41">States the country where she came from</text>

  <text start="530.13" dur="7.25">from</text>
  <text start="531.589" dur="5.791">so this just demonstrates the complete</text>
  <text start="537.41" dur="5.08">mischaracterization of anything that he</text>
  <text start="540.329" dur="4.261">says they always want to turn it around</text>
  <text start="542.49" dur="5.07">and make it seem like it&amp;#39;s about race</text>
  <text start="544.59" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s about racism it&amp;#39;s about sexism it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="559.11" dur="8.79">to be that way and here is this constant</text>
  <text start="563.91" dur="7.11">push for racism it does not exist</text>
  <text start="567.9" dur="5.939">in the way that you&amp;#39;re claiming it does</text>
  <text start="571.02" dur="5.46">you know he is not racist and this</text>
  <text start="573.839" dur="4.231">statement is not racist okay enough of</text>
  <text start="576.48" dur="3.09">that I just wanted to point that out</text>
  <text start="578.07" dur="4.62">tell me what you guys think about that</text>
  <text start="579.57" dur="5.85">whole thing but really my opinion is is</text>
  <text start="582.69" dur="7.28">that this was a completely sarcastic</text>
  <text start="585.42" dur="7.29">statement directed at one person</text>
  <text start="589.97" dur="5.17">all right so yesterday they did carry</text>
  <text start="592.71" dur="5.16">out the ice raids and in this article</text>
  <text start="595.14" dur="4.53">coming out of ABC News they&amp;#39;re claiming</text>
  <text start="597.87" dur="3.45">that it falls short of what they</text>
  <text start="599.67" dur="5.94">initially thought it was going to be so</text>
  <text start="601.32" dur="7.41">you know they are claiming that they</text>
  <text start="605.61" dur="5.729">expected it to be this huge massive</text>
  <text start="608.73" dur="4.83">sweep where ice comes in and just you</text>
  <text start="611.339" dur="4.321">know takes out everyone women men</text>

  <text start="615.66" dur="4.14">removes them violently from the cities</text>
  <text start="617.85" dur="5.16">but of course that didn&amp;#39;t happen you</text>
  <text start="619.8" dur="6.63">know they came in they removed people</text>
  <text start="623.01" dur="5.43">who were already ordered out of the</text>
  <text start="626.43" dur="5.04">country that was the point of this whole</text>
  <text start="628.44" dur="5.7">thing the focus really of this raid was</text>
  <text start="631.47" dur="5.4">to remove those who have already been</text>
  <text start="634.14" dur="6.24">through the process and they have been</text>
  <text start="636.87" dur="8.13">court-ordered to leave this country and</text>
  <text start="640.38" dur="7.14">so by then staying here they are defying</text>
  <text start="645" dur="5.28">that court order and so of course by law</text>
  <text start="647.52" dur="6.18">then you know they have to be removed so</text>
  <text start="650.28" dur="5.28">of course I sing come in and sweep out</text>
  <text start="653.7" dur="3.57">everybody now eventually at some point</text>
  <text start="655.56" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s gonna come down to</text>
  <text start="657.27" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;re going to get rid of anyone who</text>
  <text start="659.88" dur="6.42">is here illegally okay if you want to be</text>

  <text start="706.85" dur="5.38">really the language you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="708.93" dur="5.49">speak here is English Americans we speak</text>
  <text start="712.23" dur="4.5">English you know I mean there are those</text>
  <text start="714.42" dur="3.69">of us who have you know second languages</text>
  <text start="716.73" dur="3.09">they&amp;#39;re languages both languages or</text>
  <text start="718.11" dur="2.13">whatever but it&amp;#39;s supposed to be English</text>
  <text start="719.82" dur="2.4">right</text>
  <text start="720.24" dur="3.9">so it should be a requirement that if</text>
  <text start="722.22" dur="3.66">you come here you got to learn English</text>
  <text start="724.14" dur="4.23">just like if I wanted to go to China or</text>
  <text start="725.88" dur="4.35">wherever you know I would have to learn</text>
  <text start="728.37" dur="3.09">that language if I want to get by I mean</text>
  <text start="730.23" dur="2.97">what am I gonna do if I can&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="731.46" dur="3.54">Chinese and I go somewhere and I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="733.2" dur="3.06">communicate with people it just makes</text>
  <text start="735" dur="3.09">sense if you&amp;#39;re going somewhere else</text>
  <text start="736.26" dur="4.11">where they speak a different language</text>
  <text start="738.09" dur="6.9">you have to learn that language you know</text>
  <text start="740.37" dur="6.66">but there is the exception here where</text>
  <text start="744.99" dur="4.55">certain people don&amp;#39;t have to learn</text>
  <text start="747.03" dur="5.67">English in order to become a citizen and</text>
  <text start="749.54" dur="5.65">of course again you know there are</text>
  <text start="752.7" dur="6.45">agencies that will help you through the</text>
  <text start="755.19" dur="6.03">process to become a citizen and I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="759.15" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s even if you&amp;#39;re you know</text>
  <text start="761.22" dur="3.6">financially strapped where you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="763.23" dur="3.33">have the money I&amp;#39;m sure there are</text>
  <text start="764.82" dur="5.37">scholarships and things like that there</text>
  <text start="766.56" dur="5.13">are so many ways we could just become a</text>
  <text start="770.19" dur="5.1">legal citizen if you want to be here</text>
  <text start="771.69" dur="6.51">otherwise then get out and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="775.29" dur="4.77">ice is gonna do ice isn&amp;#39;t going to go</text>
  <text start="778.2" dur="6.84">through the process of trying to remove</text>
  <text start="780.06" dur="6.71">people who are not here legally and who</text>
  <text start="785.04" dur="8.82">are not even trying to be here legally</text>
  <text start="786.77" dur="11.5">so also I think that if they are going</text>
  <text start="793.86" dur="7.74">to do more right now beyond just those</text>
  <text start="798.27" dur="5.34">who you know work or ordered out they</text>
  <text start="801.6" dur="3.45">were obviously not going to do it on the</text>
  <text start="803.61" dur="2.85">same day that they had made this huge</text>
  <text start="805.05" dur="3.32">announcement where they were going to be</text>
  <text start="806.46" dur="5.419">massive rates</text>
  <text start="808.37" dur="5.519">you don&amp;#39;t give away your moves because</text>
  <text start="811.879" dur="4.411">you know when you make these types of</text>
  <text start="813.889" dur="4.56">announcements then it can you know it</text>
  <text start="816.29" dur="3.959">allows the people who you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="818.449" dur="6.151">target they can then come up with a plan</text>
  <text start="820.249" dur="7.65">to avoid your plan right so I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="824.6" dur="5.909">sure that these other raids are going to</text>
  <text start="827.899" dur="7.11">take place really unannounced and</text>
  <text start="830.509" dur="6.481">unexpected so of course you know these</text>
  <text start="835.009" dur="5.07">cities are saying that you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="836.99" dur="5.339">in high alert still and the president is</text>
  <text start="840.079" dur="6.57">operating the country in fear no you</text>
  <text start="842.329" dur="7.021">know he he is doing his job he is the</text>
  <text start="846.649" dur="6.36">leader of this country and he is</text>
  <text start="849.35" dur="5.399">protecting his people okay so if you</text>
  <text start="853.009" dur="5.94">don&amp;#39;t belong here then you have to get</text>
  <text start="854.749" dur="6.481">out in other news Guantanamo detainee</text>
  <text start="858.949" dur="5.31">trials could be broadcast online thanks</text>
  <text start="861.23" dur="5.969">to a house measure so an amendment that</text>
  <text start="864.259" dur="6.031">was added to the National Defense</text>
  <text start="867.199" dur="8.01">Authorization Act for 2020 by Adam</text>

  <text start="875.209" dur="9.271">allow remote viewing of trials within</text>
  <text start="882.17" dur="4.74">Guantanamo Bay and of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="884.48" dur="6.779">saying that this is to allow for more</text>
  <text start="886.91" dur="7.289">transparency and really this is going to</text>
  <text start="891.259" dur="5.7">be very interesting because you know</text>
  <text start="894.199" dur="5.7">right now we do know that they have been</text>
  <text start="896.959" dur="5.04">prepping Guantanamo Bay for something</text>
  <text start="899.899" dur="5.88">for quite a while they&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="901.999" dur="7.851">some major expansions on it and they</text>
  <text start="905.779" dur="7.65">have you know also been sending more</text>
  <text start="909.85" dur="6.52">personnel there so what are they doing</text>
  <text start="913.429" dur="5.551">what are they preparing for it there are</text>
  <text start="916.37" dur="6.6">those of us including myself who think</text>
  <text start="918.98" dur="6.419">that this has to do with the military</text>
  <text start="922.97" dur="4.229">tribunals and that you know this is</text>
  <text start="925.399" dur="3.36">where one of the places anyway because</text>
  <text start="927.199" dur="2.871">there are a couple of other places that</text>
  <text start="928.759" dur="5.021">they are preparing as</text>
  <text start="930.07" dur="5.97">but this is going to be one of the major</text>
  <text start="933.78" dur="5.68">facilities that they are going to have</text>
  <text start="936.04" dur="7.59">these military tribunals for those who</text>
  <text start="939.46" dur="6.72">have committed treason so you know</text>
  <text start="943.63" dur="7.02">ultimately hopefully this will include</text>
  <text start="946.18" dur="8.93">people like Carrie I would hope he is on</text>
  <text start="950.65" dur="4.46">the list he&amp;#39;s a definite shoo-in for</text>
  <text start="955.56" dur="7.66">treason because of the Logan Act also</text>
  <text start="959.86" dur="6.87">people like Brennan and also Obama</text>
  <text start="963.22" dur="8.04">hopefully so we will see but you know</text>
  <text start="966.73" dur="8.31">this is a good thing so we will be able</text>
  <text start="971.26" dur="6">to see these military tribunals the</text>
  <text start="975.04" dur="4.41">public will be able to view it and they</text>
  <text start="977.26" dur="4.2">will be able to see for themselves the</text>
  <text start="979.45" dur="5.97">crimes that these people have committed</text>
  <text start="981.46" dur="8.37">because right now interestingly there is</text>
  <text start="985.42" dur="9.96">the existence of two alternate realities</text>
  <text start="989.83" dur="7.71">so and one reality there is a set of</text>
  <text start="995.38" dur="4.77">people that really believe President</text>
  <text start="997.54" dur="6.63">Trump is evil and that he colluded with</text>
  <text start="1000.15" dur="6.21">Russia and that Obama and Hillary they</text>
  <text start="1004.17" dur="5.79">are Saints and that they can do no wrong</text>
  <text start="1006.36" dur="8.01">and on the other hand there is another</text>
  <text start="1009.96" dur="7.02">reality the true reality that president</text>
  <text start="1014.37" dur="6.18">Truong while not perfect is doing</text>
  <text start="1016.98" dur="8.24">everything he can to restore this</text>
  <text start="1020.55" dur="10.789">country and to work for its people and</text>
  <text start="1025.22" dur="11.05">also the fact that Obama and Hillary are</text>
  <text start="1031.339" dur="8.231">not good people and that they have done</text>
  <text start="1036.27" dur="6.51">a lot of really heinous things including</text>
  <text start="1039.57" dur="10.41">betray this country including abused</text>
  <text start="1042.78" dur="13.56">children including other crimes that</text>
  <text start="1049.98" dur="9.26">have harmed people they have done</text>
  <text start="1056.34" dur="5.809">everything to</text>
  <text start="1059.24" dur="7.919">forward their own agendas and line their</text>
  <text start="1062.149" dur="11.041">own pockets everything including run</text>
  <text start="1067.159" dur="9.931">over others sacrifice others Benghazi is</text>
  <text start="1073.19" dur="5.82">one example of that and hopefully</text>
  <text start="1077.09" dur="5.6">Benghazi will be exposed because</text>
  <text start="1079.01" dur="7.08">Benghazi really was about they</text>
  <text start="1082.69" dur="5.77">sacrificed our own people in order to</text>
  <text start="1086.09" dur="6.689">hide their own crimes in order to hide</text>
  <text start="1088.46" dur="5.969">their own treason so there are two</text>
  <text start="1092.779" dur="4.14">separate realities here you know so a</text>
  <text start="1094.429" dur="5.49">lot of times I feel sorry for these</text>
  <text start="1096.919" dur="5.161">people who are so crazed with Trump</text>
  <text start="1099.919" dur="5.971">derangement Center because they really</text>
  <text start="1102.08" dur="6.75">believe really within their souls they</text>
  <text start="1105.89" dur="5.909">are so deceived that they believe these</text>
  <text start="1108.83" dur="5.19">people are good people they believe that</text>
  <text start="1111.799" dur="5.941">Obama was the greatest present on earth</text>
  <text start="1114.02" dur="8.22">they believe that Trump is evil this is</text>

  <text start="1372.95" dur="7.68">they are they&amp;#39;re dangerous okay</text>
  <text start="1377.54" dur="7.07">in other news so when I got on Twitter</text>
  <text start="1380.63" dur="8.04">today I noticed you know this trending</text>
  <text start="1384.61" dur="6.51">hashtag rip at Bianca now typically I</text>
  <text start="1388.67" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t look at the trends that much</text>
  <text start="1391.12" dur="4.09">especially because a lot of times the</text>
  <text start="1393.74" dur="3.06">things that are trending are not</text>
  <text start="1395.21" dur="3.72">necessarily things that are important</text>
  <text start="1396.8" dur="5.1">however I have been watching it a little</text>
  <text start="1398.93" dur="6.6">bit just because you know we are kind of</text>
  <text start="1401.9" dur="5.94">expecting an uptick of deaths and</text>
  <text start="1405.53" dur="5.34">perhaps maybe suicides because of the</text>
  <text start="1407.84" dur="5.16">Epstein trial that is going to be coming</text>
  <text start="1410.87" dur="6.99">up so of course you know Epstein is</text>
  <text start="1413" dur="9.23">being held right now so there is this</text>
  <text start="1417.86" dur="8.28">idea that people are going to start</text>
  <text start="1422.23" dur="7.42">disappearing or dying in order to cover</text>
  <text start="1426.14" dur="4.17">themselves so I looked at this rip</text>
  <text start="1429.65" dur="3.78">beocca</text>
  <text start="1430.31" dur="6.42">and it is so disturbing it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1433.43" dur="5.55">really bad and here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s the worst</text>
  <text start="1436.73" dur="5.37">part about it the worst part about it is</text>
  <text start="1438.98" dur="5.91">that it was left on social media so</text>
  <text start="1442.1" dur="5.82">while social media Giants try to claim</text>
  <text start="1444.89" dur="5.1">that they want to censor certain things</text>
  <text start="1447.92" dur="5.31">in order to protect people from</text>
  <text start="1449.99" dur="5.23">dangerous tweets and and dangerous posts</text>
  <text start="1453.23" dur="4.21">and all of that</text>

  <text start="1573.3" dur="6.96">not flag this post at all they just left</text>
  <text start="1576.9" dur="9">it there until it was viral this post</text>
  <text start="1580.26" dur="8.67">went viral so really this censorship is</text>
  <text start="1585.9" dur="4.95">not about protecting people from hates</text>
  <text start="1588.93" dur="5.4">protecting people from disturbing and</text>
  <text start="1590.85" dur="6.27">threatening images you know it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1594.33" dur="5.16">about them silencing voices they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1597.12" dur="5.55">like and yet there at the same time</text>
  <text start="1599.49" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;re exposing these types of</text>
  <text start="1602.67" dur="5.19">disturbing images this was a poor young</text>
  <text start="1605.43" dur="5.9">girl and of course these pictures were</text>
  <text start="1607.86" dur="6.51">plastered all over Instagram and discord</text>
  <text start="1611.33" dur="9.51">this poor girl who was murdered and</text>
  <text start="1614.37" dur="9.18">decapitated not okay this is not okay so</text>
  <text start="1620.84" dur="5.14">anyway I just wanted to touch on that a</text>
  <text start="1623.55" dur="5.97">little bit because I just found it</text>
  <text start="1625.98" dur="5.34">really disgusting that they would even</text>
  <text start="1629.52" dur="4.02">let this go viral and at the same time</text>
  <text start="1631.32" dur="3.75">you know they they censor everyone else</text>
  <text start="1633.54" dur="6.45">that they don&amp;#39;t like but yet they allow</text>
  <text start="1635.07" dur="7.5">this in other news this is an update on</text>
  <text start="1639.99" dur="4.95">the Epstein case New Mexico authorities</text>
  <text start="1642.57" dur="3.27">are probing his Zorro ranch over abuse</text>
  <text start="1644.94" dur="3.78">allegations</text>
  <text start="1645.84" dur="5.97">so now victims have said that they were</text>
  <text start="1648.72" dur="5.48">abused at the Zorro ranch as well and so</text>
  <text start="1651.81" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re looking into that and he had</text>
  <text start="1654.2" dur="3.97">several properties across the globe and</text>
  <text start="1656.91" dur="3.3">they should be combing through every</text>
  <text start="1658.17" dur="7.04">single one of them for evidence which</text>
  <text start="1660.21" dur="8.49">they probably are at this point also</text>
  <text start="1665.21" dur="6.46">when it comes to the place where Epstein</text>
  <text start="1668.7" dur="7.02">is being held it&amp;#39;s not exactly the cozy</text>
  <text start="1671.67" dur="7.86">experience he had before so he&amp;#39;s it was</text>
  <text start="1675.72" dur="6.3">hinted that he was housed with El Chapo</text>
  <text start="1679.53" dur="4.47">so where is El Chapo being held well</text>
  <text start="1682.02" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s apparently a place that&amp;#39;s worse</text>
  <text start="1684" dur="5.28">than Kwan&amp;#39;s Hana MoBay now apparently</text>
  <text start="1686.4" dur="5.73">the conditions here are really not</text>
  <text start="1689.28" dur="7.56">pleasant at all most of them are held in</text>
  <text start="1692.13" dur="8.58">solitary confinement where it&amp;#39;s said</text>
  <text start="1696.84" dur="6.18">that it can really drive a person crazy</text>
  <text start="1700.71" dur="5.55">because the only sounds that you hear</text>
  <text start="1703.02" dur="6.9">whatsoever are the banging of the metal</text>
  <text start="1706.26" dur="6.33">on the doors and that&amp;#39;s it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1709.92" dur="5.43">get recreation time they don&amp;#39;t get to go</text>
  <text start="1712.59" dur="5.13">out and play basketball they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1715.35" dur="4.98">to go out and watch TV they&amp;#39;re held in</text>
  <text start="1717.72" dur="3.65">solitary confinement now this is good</text>
  <text start="1720.33" dur="4.46">for a couple of reasons</text>
  <text start="1721.37" dur="5.1">one because we really don&amp;#39;t want Epstein</text>
  <text start="1724.79" dur="3.69">to have any kind of a pleasant</text>
  <text start="1726.47" dur="4.59">experience whatsoever especially since</text>
  <text start="1728.48" dur="7.23">the with the sweetheart deal that he had</text>
  <text start="1731.06" dur="7.11">before he wasn&amp;#39;t even he wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1735.71" dur="5.79">forced to stay in his cell most of the</text>
  <text start="1738.17" dur="6.72">time he was let go for business or</text>
  <text start="1741.5" dur="7.95">whatever so you know he didn&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1744.89" dur="7.53">stay and also when he was in his cell it</text>
  <text start="1749.45" dur="5.01">was a very cozy solitary cell he had</text>
  <text start="1752.42" dur="5.88">lots of amenities and all of that I mean</text>
  <text start="1754.46" dur="7.08">it was almost like a hotel experience it</text>
  <text start="1758.3" dur="6.21">was not a punishment whatsoever so the</text>
  <text start="1761.54" dur="4.83">fact that this place is so terribly</text>
  <text start="1764.51" dur="3.9">unpleasant that it is described as a</text>
  <text start="1766.37" dur="4.02">place that can simply drive you mad that</text>
  <text start="1768.41" dur="5.94">is a good thing we want this guy to</text>
  <text start="1770.39" dur="8.34">suffer because he made so many young</text>
  <text start="1774.35" dur="7.14">girls suffer at his hands also the other</text>
  <text start="1778.73" dur="5.46">thing is the reason why it&amp;#39;s good is</text>
  <text start="1781.49" dur="6.39">because these prisoners are held in</text>
  <text start="1784.19" dur="5.85">solitary confinement he needs to be held</text>
  <text start="1787.88" dur="7.71">at solitary confinement because they</text>
  <text start="1790.04" dur="11.43">need to protect him from probably an</text>
  <text start="1795.59" dur="9.15">impending death so we know that he is</text>
  <text start="1801.47" dur="7.05">the key a lot of people are gonna fall</text>
  <text start="1804.74" dur="6.03">because of this guy and so a lot of</text>
  <text start="1808.52" dur="6.03">powerful people probably want him dead</text>
  <text start="1810.77" dur="6.3">before their names are given up before</text>
  <text start="1814.55" dur="5.61">he can give over any information that</text>
  <text start="1817.07" dur="5.16">might incriminate them so just because</text>
  <text start="1820.16" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re in jail doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re safe</text>
  <text start="1822.23" dur="5.25">from those people who want you dead you</text>
  <text start="1824.66" dur="5.13">know in jails prisons it&amp;#39;s very common</text>
  <text start="1827.48" dur="5.01">for let&amp;#39;s say someone wants someone dead</text>
  <text start="1829.79" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s in jail they you know pay someone</text>
  <text start="1832.49" dur="8.22">on the inside they get someone on the</text>
  <text start="1834.17" dur="9.45">inside to make the kill but if he&amp;#39;s held</text>
  <text start="1840.71" dur="6.69">in solitary confinement then no one can</text>
  <text start="1843.62" dur="6.27">reach him so that&amp;#39;s good so it&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="1847.4" dur="4.38">for two reasons one so he can suffer -</text>
  <text start="1849.89" dur="4.42">so he can stay a lot alive long enough</text>
  <text start="1851.78" dur="5.77">in order to bury others</text>
  <text start="1854.31" dur="6.01">all right so that&amp;#39;s all I have for today</text>
