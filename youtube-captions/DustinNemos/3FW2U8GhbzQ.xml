  <text start="417.3" dur="4.56">would do if I were president I would</text>
  <text start="419.28" dur="4.68">agree with you on that John obviously a</text>
  <text start="421.86" dur="4.44">lot of people are looking at at Donald</text>

  <text start="438.27" dur="3.959">Trump&amp;#39;s first term in office and where</text>
  <text start="440.34" dur="4.889">we might be headed I feel a lot like</text>

  <text start="466.979" dur="6.151">about America how America is run and Jim</text>
  <text start="470.099" dur="4.981">Garrison said it in 1981 when I</text>
  <text start="473.13" dur="3.93">interviewed him for three hours in New</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="3.66">Orleans I asked that the president the</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="4.44">United States runs the country and he</text>
  <text start="478.74" dur="5.549">says no after they murdered John Kennedy</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="4.68">no president will ever run the United</text>

  <text start="486.18" dur="4.68">problems of Donald Trump is facing now</text>

  <text start="510.01" dur="6.3">corporations are people corporations are</text>
  <text start="512.89" dur="6.99">not people and until that is remedy we</text>
