  <text start="1133.139" dur="5.4">a big year I mean it seems like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1135.99" dur="4.439">pretty well into the start of the attack</text>
  <text start="1138.539" dur="3.661">phase right like he was talking about it</text>
  <text start="1140.429" dur="3.69">for a very long time we saw it coming</text>
  <text start="1142.2" dur="4.049">for a very long time there was the</text>
  <text start="1144.119" dur="4.89">build-up there was the the tearing down</text>
  <text start="1146.249" dur="5.91">of the old credibility of the MSM queue</text>
  <text start="1149.009" dur="5.37">said break the MSM right that was my my</text>
  <text start="1152.159" dur="4.561">slogan for a long time and we did we</text>
  <text start="1154.379" dur="5.971">broke them Digital soldiers United to</text>
  <text start="1156.72" dur="5.339">break them and then it was kind of</text>
  <text start="1160.35" dur="3.51">waiting for the judicial branch to be</text>
  <text start="1162.059" dur="4.771">sort of restocked with conservative and</text>
  <text start="1163.86" dur="5.22">honest constitutional judges that</text>
  <text start="1166.83" dur="4.65">happened in a big big big way including</text>
  <text start="1169.08" dur="4.229">and sort of culminating in Kavanagh</text>
  <text start="1171.48" dur="4.139">right where they had sort of this peak</text>
  <text start="1173.309" dur="4.2">crazy moment and ever since then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1175.619" dur="5.701">just been downhill from them in massive</text>
  <text start="1177.509" dur="5.941">ways so it seems like now we now that</text>
  <text start="1181.32" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;ve gotten the Mueller blockade out of</text>
  <text start="1183.45" dur="5.459">the way like he was talking about now it</text>
  <text start="1186.69" dur="4.229">looks like Flynn&amp;#39;s cuffs are off where</text>
  <text start="1188.909" dur="3.63">he had you know Q had said a father will</text>
  <text start="1190.919" dur="4.11">do anything for his children right I</text>
  <text start="1192.539" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t remember the exact words but I</text>
  <text start="1195.029" dur="5.73">think a Father&amp;#39;s love knows no bounds or</text>
  <text start="1197.789" dur="4.71">something like that so now Flint and</text>
  <text start="1200.759" dur="4.05">Tufts seem to be off and now he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1202.499" dur="4.65">from defense it seems to offense it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="1204.809" dur="3.631">words not theirs you know I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="1207.149" dur="4.591">careful not to put words in their mouths</text>
  <text start="1208.44" dur="7.199">but the Flynn family but it seems to be</text>
  <text start="1211.74" dur="5.669">the offense side of things you know and</text>
  <text start="1215.639" dur="3.301">I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m leaving some things out but</text>
  <text start="1217.409" dur="4.35">you see that we&amp;#39;ve established this</text>
  <text start="1218.94" dur="4.41">pattern of just ramping up the damage</text>
  <text start="1221.759" dur="3.331">that we&amp;#39;re doing to their narrative and</text>
  <text start="1223.35" dur="6.769">to their control and it seems to be just</text>
  <text start="1225.09" dur="5.029">getting almost to the point of arrests</text>
  <text start="1233.149" dur="6.311">and look how many people are being</text>
  <text start="1236.85" dur="5.22">killed how many are we up to four or</text>
  <text start="1239.46" dur="3.87">five police in New York City now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1242.07" dur="3.03">sure they didn&amp;#39;t have anything to do</text>
  <text start="1243.33" dur="5.819">with the laptop from Anthony Weiner</text>
  <text start="1245.1" dur="7.01">right sure just a coincidence how many</text>
  <text start="1249.149" dur="5.071">people just this year have to die before</text>
  <text start="1252.11" dur="3.939">testifying against the Clintons how many</text>

  <text start="1256.049" dur="5.73">against the Clintons just this year you</text>
  <text start="1260.549" dur="4.651">know they so these are these are very</text>
  <text start="1261.779" dur="5.041">interesting questions to answer and then</text>
  <text start="1265.2" dur="4.28">of course political figures back</text>
  <text start="1266.82" dur="5.79">senators are dying</text>
  <text start="1269.48" dur="10.96">suicides I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s been a depressing</text>
  <text start="1272.61" dur="9.36">year I guess for some people right I do</text>
  <text start="1280.44" dur="4.349">not believe that Mueller is a gray hat I</text>
  <text start="1281.97" dur="5.339">think Mueller did his best to bring</text>
  <text start="1284.789" dur="5.281">POTUS down and I think that he failed</text>
  <text start="1287.309" dur="4.74">and I really realizes as soon as Barr</text>
  <text start="1290.07" dur="3.209">came in look and Bars the buddy of his</text>
  <text start="1292.049" dur="2.49">right I think they were friends on the</text>
  <text start="1293.279" dur="2.64">backend went to each other&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1294.539" dur="4.89">weddings and all these other things</text>
  <text start="1295.919" dur="5.541">right so they were friends they brought</text>
  <text start="1299.429" dur="4.681">him in and sat him down and said look</text>
  <text start="1301.46" dur="4.03">you&amp;#39;ve got nothing if you try this it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1304.11" dur="7.02">just show you and you&amp;#39;ll probably go to</text>
  <text start="1305.49" dur="6.659">prison and you know beyond that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1311.13" dur="3.06">still gonna do everything he can to</text>
  <text start="1312.149" dur="4.231">bring the POTUS down you know he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1314.19" dur="4.199">still go out there do his his spiel and</text>
  <text start="1316.38" dur="3.69">he&amp;#39;ll rot there and and try to twist the</text>
  <text start="1318.389" dur="4.201">narrative again but he&amp;#39;s not gonna lie</text>
  <text start="1320.07" dur="5.52">on the record not not intentionally and</text>
  <text start="1322.59" dur="4.939">get in trouble himself he&amp;#39;ll push it as</text>
  <text start="1325.59" dur="4.199">far as you can without personal risk</text>
  <text start="1327.529" dur="3.61">what else you gonna do and if he goes</text>
  <text start="1329.789" dur="2.01">beyond that you know they&amp;#39;re gonna kill</text>
  <text start="1331.139" dur="2.701">him otherwise</text>
  <text start="1331.799" dur="4.651">cuz why else would you go beyond that</text>
