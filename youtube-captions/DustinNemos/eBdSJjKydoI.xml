  <text start="176.3" dur="4.59">before it was much more of a moral case</text>
  <text start="178.22" dur="4.02">you know it was a clear-cut moral case</text>
  <text start="180.89" dur="3.12">that were being censored but now we</text>
  <text start="182.24" dur="4.35">really have to think in terms of Lee</text>
  <text start="184.01" dur="5.43">believes in strategy and tactics in that</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="7.08">sense not my area of strength that&amp;#39;s why</text>

  <text start="201.38" dur="5.42">clouds pretty crazy it&amp;#39;s a beautiful</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="7.2">sunset a minute ago and then I&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="206.8" dur="5.26">get a I guess like a nonprofit set up</text>
  <text start="210.74" dur="2.67">I&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and pay him to get it</text>
  <text start="212.06" dur="4.34">started but I&amp;#39;m gonna set up some sort</text>
  <text start="213.41" dur="5.28">of a non-profit so that we can actually</text>
  <text start="216.4" dur="3.58">do donations and stuff because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="2.79">gonna cost like two hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="4.34">dollars you warranty this thing going</text>
  <text start="221.48" dur="2.84">with four bills</text>
  <text start="225.26" dur="5.309">but it&amp;#39;s all moving along we&amp;#39;ve got to</text>
  <text start="228.8" dur="3.24">do some more strategy conversations I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="230.569" dur="3.571">got to bring on some other people to get</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="4.89">this nonprofit thing involved there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.14" dur="4.679">there&amp;#39;s stuff to be done it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="236.93" dur="5.43">time thing and now that I&amp;#39;m back it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="238.819" dur="5.971">primary focus obviously so autism one</text>
  <text start="242.36" dur="4.95">just happened and this is the Florida</text>
  <text start="244.79" dur="3.93">clouds here so autism one just happened</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="5.58">all you guys have a few how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.72" dur="6.71">talking it&amp;#39;s probably gonna be pretty</text>
  <text start="252.89" dur="5.189">hard on the like the data uploading but</text>
  <text start="255.43" dur="6.19">autism what happened and it was great</text>
  <text start="258.079" dur="5.971">guys I went there with the goal of</text>
  <text start="261.62" dur="4.53">winning over the hearts and minds of the</text>
  <text start="264.05" dur="4.59">thought leaders of that community with</text>
  <text start="266.15" dur="5.04">some of the logical you know approaches</text>
  <text start="268.64" dur="6.51">to the tactical approaches I would say</text>
  <text start="271.19" dur="5.34">to kind of fighting evil you know sort</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="4.11">of some of the phases I&amp;#39;ve talked about</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="5.1">kind of my plan to stop evil and phase</text>
  <text start="279.26" dur="3.92">one of course being censorship that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.63" dur="5.16">something that they care very much about</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="5.65">obviously they are obviously being</text>
  <text start="286.79" dur="3.99">censored but in my experience there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="288.83" dur="3.96">nothing being censored more actually</text>
  <text start="290.78" dur="4.119">than the vaccine community the anti</text>
  <text start="292.79" dur="4.669">vaccine community</text>
  <text start="294.899" dur="4.81">they are really going hard against</text>
  <text start="297.459" dur="4.14">anyone that puts out any kind of truly</text>
  <text start="299.709" dur="4.68">healing information like Carrie Rivera&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.599" dur="4.71">book was banned so you know and she</text>
  <text start="304.389" dur="4.83">wasn&amp;#39;t even if she&amp;#39;s obviously against</text>
  <text start="306.309" dur="5.07">vaccines but she was more approaching</text>
  <text start="309.219" dur="3.9">just the autism itself and it ways to</text>
  <text start="311.379" dur="4.65">address it so so they don&amp;#39;t want you to</text>
  <text start="313.119" dur="5.01">get help if you&amp;#39;ve been damaged you know</text>
  <text start="316.029" dur="5.4">they want you to be sick and miserable</text>
  <text start="318.129" dur="5.66">and dependent on them so this community</text>
  <text start="321.429" dur="7.5">is on board they loved it they are</text>
  <text start="323.789" dur="10.18">completely you know they are ready to</text>
  <text start="328.929" dur="7.98">see a path they need hope I mean they</text>
  <text start="333.969" dur="5.4">that community is so passionate and they</text>
  <text start="336.909" dur="4.86">are so driven and they are so optimistic</text>
  <text start="339.369" dur="5.19">now because it&amp;#39;s time I mean they really</text>
  <text start="341.769" dur="4.08">have walked the gauntlet and been</text>
  <text start="344.559" dur="3.69">through the fire and everything I mean</text>
  <text start="345.849" dur="5.22">Andrew Wakefield Dell big tree all of</text>
  <text start="348.249" dur="5.97">these leaders they have been through</text>
  <text start="351.069" dur="4.53">some stuff guys and you know I think</text>
  <text start="354.219" dur="3.03">that I might have to go through some of</text>
  <text start="355.599" dur="3.72">that stuff in the future and I hope I</text>
  <text start="357.249" dur="5.4">pray I can be half the people that they</text>
  <text start="359.319" dur="4.92">are but they have been through some</text>
  <text start="362.649" dur="2.681">stuff for this cause and for these</text>
  <text start="364.239" dur="4.061">children</text>
  <text start="365.33" dur="4.41">and you know I want to help them and I</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="3">want to bring them into the Free Speech</text>
  <text start="369.74" dur="3.06">Movement at the same time the Free</text>
  <text start="371.3" dur="4.23">Speech Movement that we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="372.8" dur="5.73">addressing and talking about more as the</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="4.71">lawsuit progresses because they&amp;#39;re the</text>
  <text start="378.53" dur="3.27">same thing and I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m not reading</text>
  <text start="380.24" dur="3.959">right now I&amp;#39;ll get to their questions in</text>
  <text start="381.8" dur="4.109">a second they&amp;#39;re the same thing</text>
  <text start="384.199" dur="4.53">this lawsuit and this free speech</text>
  <text start="385.909" dur="4.23">movement because it&amp;#39;s not just about the</text>
  <text start="388.729" dur="3.06">lawsuit it&amp;#39;s not just about this one</text>
  <text start="390.139" dur="3.541">lawsuit it&amp;#39;s not just about what if they</text>
  <text start="391.789" dur="4.47">they win this or lose this or whatever</text>
  <text start="393.68" dur="5.1">kind of court advantages they might pull</text>
  <text start="396.259" dur="4.051">out or judges they may control or bribe</text>
  <text start="398.78" dur="4.71">or whatever they may play this is a</text>
  <text start="400.31" dur="6.06">movement it&amp;#39;s a revolution peaceful and</text>
  <text start="403.49" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s not stopping and we&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="406.37" dur="6.359">go backward obviously so this movement</text>
  <text start="408.5" dur="7.11">is the true goal is the true power sorry</text>
  <text start="412.729" dur="4.711">if the bounciness it&amp;#39;s the true power of</text>
  <text start="415.61" dur="3.66">what we&amp;#39;re about to do the lawsuit guys</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="3.21">in my opinion is ten percent of this I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="419.27" dur="3.03">going to give it my everything and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="420.65" dur="3.359">going to fight design think that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="422.3" dur="3.239">we&amp;#39;re gonna get a lot of attention a lot</text>
  <text start="424.009" dur="5.31">of them laments on a lot of the energy</text>
  <text start="425.539" dur="5.611">and a lot of the victories but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="429.319" dur="4.141">think that&amp;#39;s the biggest victory at all</text>
  <text start="431.15" dur="5.31">I think that the group the goal is that</text>
  <text start="433.46" dur="5.489">the where we go on we go all we are</text>
  <text start="436.46" dur="4.389">building a philosophical army and</text>

  <text start="445.8" dur="5.25">various different interests obviously</text>
  <text start="448.529" dur="3.991">you know this community is more focused</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="3.329">on healing children and protecting</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="4.53">children and alternative health and</text>
  <text start="454.379" dur="5.31">stopping these poisons and that&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="457.05" dur="4.589">priority of mine as well my focus is on</text>
