  <text start="26.3" dur="2.059">you</text>
  <text start="33.1" dur="4.75">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="35.93" dur="4.199">most of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="37.85" dur="3.69">joined again by Todd McMurtry here and</text>
  <text start="40.129" dur="4.32">he is going to help us kind of</text>
  <text start="41.54" dur="5.089">understand first of all I invited him on</text>
  <text start="44.449" dur="4.801">to discuss Laurel in pursuit she&amp;#39;s suing</text>
  <text start="46.629" dur="5.351">big tech for billions of dollars three</text>
  <text start="49.25" dur="4.47">billion is a huge number I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="51.98" dur="3.599">how likely that is or how you know it</text>
  <text start="53.72" dur="4.5">maybe it&amp;#39;s a PR theme or whatever but</text>
  <text start="55.579" dur="4.08">you know it was worth commenting on it</text>
  <text start="58.22" dur="4.2">seems like there&amp;#39;s a lot of lawsuits</text>
  <text start="59.659" dur="4.411">lately and many of them seem to be PR</text>
  <text start="62.42" dur="3.21">stunts or maybe you know I won&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="64.07" dur="3.51">designed to fail but maybe poorly</text>
  <text start="65.63" dur="3.81">thought out in some cases and I just</text>
  <text start="67.58" dur="3.179">want to talk about effective strategy</text>
  <text start="69.44" dur="4.41">and what kind of odds are actually there</text>
  <text start="70.759" dur="5.64">- maybe she has a chance maybe she</text>
  <text start="73.85" dur="5.34">doesn&amp;#39;t and then beyond that who could</text>
  <text start="76.399" dur="4.651">have a chance what what could win Todd</text>
  <text start="79.19" dur="2.58">thank you so much for taking the time to</text>
  <text start="81.05" dur="2.55">join us this morning</text>
  <text start="81.77" dur="3.989">yeah thanks Dustin it&amp;#39;s good to be with</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="3.96">you you know you raised a good good</text>
  <text start="85.759" dur="4.021">question I&amp;#39;ll start with talking about</text>
  <text start="87.56" dur="4.86">the Laura Loomer lawsuit you know her</text>
  <text start="89.78" dur="5.19">lawsuit just the big number is the three</text>
  <text start="92.42" dur="5.07">billion dollar lawsuit she seeks damages</text>
  <text start="94.97" dur="4.71">of thirty five million dollars and maybe</text>
  <text start="97.49" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s the value that she attaches to</text>
  <text start="99.68" dur="3.84">her social media and network and</text>
  <text start="102.11" dur="3.39">everything that she was doing before as</text>
  <text start="103.52" dur="3.779">an influencer so I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="105.5" dur="3.329">to comment on that I will say though</text>
  <text start="107.299" dur="4.14">that the three billion is based upon a</text>
  <text start="108.829" dur="4.771">percentage of the value of Facebook so</text>
  <text start="111.439" dur="6.261">assuming she got through all the hurdles</text>
  <text start="113.6" dur="6.93">which I&amp;#39;ll talk about constitutionally</text>
  <text start="117.7" dur="4.9">you can only get damages of about ten</text>
  <text start="120.53" dur="4.65">times your what they call you know your</text>
  <text start="122.6" dur="5.1">actual damages so if she hit a grand</text>
  <text start="125.18" dur="4.439">slam home run the highest value of the</text>
  <text start="127.7" dur="3.629">lawsuit would probably be about you know</text>
  <text start="129.619" dur="3.361">under four hundred million dollars so</text>
  <text start="131.329" dur="4.44">the three billion dollars is kind of a</text>
  <text start="132.98" dur="3.96">throw away and in my view and probably</text>
  <text start="135.769" dur="3.511">not something that&amp;#39;s ultimately</text>
  <text start="136.94" dur="5.16">recoverable and we saw that up you know</text>
  <text start="139.28" dur="4.56">like Ohio for example put caps on</text>
  <text start="142.1" dur="3.75">punitive damages and we saw that in the</text>
  <text start="143.84" dur="4.709">in the bakery case up in Ohio where the</text>
  <text start="145.85" dur="5.49">the the college and the bakery had the</text>
  <text start="148.549" dur="4.741">lawsuit there was a large judgment but</text>
  <text start="151.34" dur="4.5">the trial court reduced the total amount</text>
  <text start="153.29" dur="4.8">of the punitive damages to meet Ohio law</text>
  <text start="155.84" dur="4.32">so you know there are limitations on</text>
  <text start="158.09" dur="3.57">punitive damages but you know Laurel</text>
  <text start="160.16" dur="5.43">Umar&amp;#39;s lawsuit is interesting for</text>
  <text start="161.66" dur="5.13">another reason and that it had money</text>
  <text start="165.59" dur="3.149">yeah yeah I mean you know she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.79" dur="5.01">challenging the Communications Decency</text>
  <text start="168.739" dur="5.101">Act she&amp;#39;s challenging you know social</text>
  <text start="171.8" dur="4.32">media companies primarily Facebook and</text>
  <text start="173.84" dur="6.24">what what the social media companies</text>
  <text start="176.12" dur="5.36">have said to her is you know when you in</text>
  <text start="180.08" dur="5.879">particular when you criticize</text>
  <text start="181.48" dur="6.94">representative Ilan Omar for being a and</text>
  <text start="185.959" dur="4.741">you know a follower of Sharia law and</text>
  <text start="188.42" dur="4.19">then highlighting some of the some of</text>
  <text start="190.7" dur="4.619">the tenants of Sharia law which she</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="6.04">included to be anti-semitism</text>
  <text start="195.319" dur="6.631">you know homophobia kind of lack of</text>
  <text start="198.65" dur="5.49">equality between men and women which I</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="4.68">think are likely truthful statements I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="4.56">not an expert on Islam Isis oh oh sure</text>
  <text start="206.63" dur="2.639">yeah but those are likely truthful</text>
  <text start="208.7" dur="4.44">statements</text>
  <text start="209.269" dur="5.601">so basically Facebook&amp;#39;s policy against</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="4.67">what you know hate speech in general</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="8.259">suggests that such comments are are</text>
  <text start="217.81" dur="6.7">improper and but legally those comments</text>
  <text start="223.129" dur="3.511">are certainly protected by the First</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="4.68">Amendment and proper assuming they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="226.64" dur="4.08">true which I believe them to be so but</text>
  <text start="229.19" dur="5.1">when you go onto a social media platform</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="5.73">then that changes and even though true</text>
  <text start="234.29" dur="4.199">you don&amp;#39;t gain all your First Amendment</text>
  <text start="236.45" dur="4.17">protections which is a real problem so</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="4.411">she can&amp;#39;t speak the truth on social</text>
  <text start="240.62" dur="4.229">media if somebody at Facebook considers</text>
  <text start="242.9" dur="5.369">that to be potentially an insult to</text>
  <text start="244.849" dur="5.131">Islam or Sharia law and so then they</text>
  <text start="248.269" dur="4.8">would designate that in essence as hate</text>
  <text start="249.98" dur="4.619">speech and that&amp;#39;s why she&amp;#39;s saying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="253.069" dur="3.45">defamatory what they&amp;#39;ve done to her it</text>
  <text start="254.599" dur="4.14">kind of as I understand it makes sense</text>
  <text start="256.519" dur="4.141">as though like there&amp;#39;s a bar on the</text>
  <text start="258.739" dur="3.511">corner of a street and you go into the</text>
  <text start="260.66" dur="3">bar and they don&amp;#39;t want to hear you they</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="3.389">kick you out that&amp;#39;s not really a</text>
  <text start="263.66" dur="4.77">violation of your free speech but when</text>
  <text start="265.639" dur="5.041">the bar owns the entire city there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="268.43" dur="3.989">more of a question right right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.68" dur="4.32">exactly right and there are there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="272.419" dur="5.191">older cases that would suggest that</text>
  <text start="275" dur="4.169">under that circumstance that if you want</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="3.45">to say stand out in front of that bar</text>
  <text start="279.169" dur="3.93">and pass out a leaflet which says that</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="4.859">you know Jesus Christ is my Lord and</text>
  <text start="283.099" dur="4.5">Savior repent and follow him that</text>
  <text start="285.919" dur="6.12">certainly protected speech and it would</text>
  <text start="287.599" dur="7.591">be improper for the town to then prevent</text>
  <text start="292.039" dur="4.981">you from having that free speech so kind</text>
  <text start="295.19" dur="4.259">of like a company town kind of like a</text>
  <text start="297.02" dur="4.799">public square you know</text>
  <text start="299.449" dur="6.75">our arguments out there that that are</text>
  <text start="301.819" dur="6.331">viable to say that Facebook and other</text>
  <text start="306.199" dur="3.601">social media platforms cannot prevent</text>
  <text start="308.15" dur="5.129">you from exercising your First Amendment</text>
  <text start="309.8" dur="5.13">rights on their platform and you know</text>
  <text start="313.279" dur="3.06">that&amp;#39;s ideally what would be great</text>
  <text start="314.93" dur="2.459">because all of us would like to be able</text>
  <text start="316.339" dur="4.741">to speak freely</text>
  <text start="317.389" dur="6.2">you know appropriately freely to speak</text>
  <text start="321.08" dur="7.139">the truth and not be censored for that</text>
  <text start="323.589" dur="6.13">certainly I know I would I want to</text>
  <text start="328.219" dur="3">switch it a little bit because this is</text>
  <text start="329.719" dur="3.331">one that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to come up as much</text>
  <text start="331.219" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;ve seen it raised I haven&amp;#39;t seen it</text>
  <text start="333.05" dur="3.6">raised recently that&amp;#39;s just the issue of</text>
  <text start="334.939" dur="4.47">discrimination you have any kind of</text>
  <text start="336.65" dur="5.91">thoughts on you know maybe this is for</text>
  <text start="339.409" dur="5.16">example you know the bus and someone</text>
  <text start="342.56" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s black or in this case</text>
  <text start="344.569" dur="4.65">conservative or republican has to go to</text>
  <text start="347.15" dur="3.84">the back of the bus I mean even even in</text>
  <text start="349.219" dur="3.211">a private bus scenario that would not be</text>
  <text start="350.99" dur="5.429">a moral thing at least I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="352.43" dur="6.84">about yeah I mean you know I think a</text>
  <text start="356.419" dur="4.59">better example than you know your</text>
  <text start="359.27" dur="3.75">examples fine but today we have</text>
  <text start="361.009" dur="7.291">modern-day examples where people and in</text>
  <text start="363.02" dur="8.04">the in the workplace are are lose their</text>
  <text start="368.3" dur="4.829">jobs over expressing religious views or</text>
  <text start="371.06" dur="4.56">over expressing opinions that are not</text>
  <text start="373.129" dur="4.891">appropriate you know in general though</text>
  <text start="375.62" dur="5.46">an employer has a right to fire somebody</text>
  <text start="378.02" dur="5.759">if they express some view you know that</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="6">is inappropriate for the employer except</text>
  <text start="383.779" dur="5.64">that you cannot fire somebody in many</text>
  <text start="387.08" dur="4.019">states will just use Ohio for example</text>
  <text start="389.419" dur="2.941">where I&amp;#39;m licensed to practice law there</text>
  <text start="391.099" dur="3.57">in Ohio</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="4.649">you can&amp;#39;t fire somebody for expressing a</text>
  <text start="394.669" dur="3.78">religious viewpoint say at a company</text>
  <text start="397.009" dur="3.12">meeting like I don&amp;#39;t think we should do</text>
  <text start="398.449" dur="2.31">that it&amp;#39;s against the tenets of my</text>
  <text start="400.129" dur="2.81">religion</text>
  <text start="400.759" dur="4.801">you can&amp;#39;t fire somebody for doing that</text>
  <text start="402.939" dur="5.23">and then as well you can&amp;#39;t fire somebody</text>
  <text start="405.56" dur="3.629">if they if they wear their you know I</text>
  <text start="408.169" dur="2.58">don&amp;#39;t think you could fire somebody if</text>
  <text start="409.189" dur="5.07">they were their make America great again</text>
  <text start="410.749" dur="5.91">had to work or warp in that said</text>
  <text start="414.259" dur="4.351">Republican Party or Democrat party or</text>
  <text start="416.659" dur="3.421">whatever it is you couldn&amp;#39;t fire them</text>
  <text start="418.61" dur="4.979">over that in most states that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.08" dur="4.739">certainly true in Ohio so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="423.589" dur="3.39">protection but that doesn&amp;#39;t get you</text>
  <text start="424.819" dur="4.71">around the Communications Decency Act</text>
  <text start="426.979" dur="4.69">which gives social media platforms</text>
  <text start="429.529" dur="4.991">absolutely broad describe</text>
  <text start="431.669" dur="4.62">to do what they want to do and limit the</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="3.03">speech in any manner that they want so</text>
  <text start="436.289" dur="4.171">they really do have this kind of</text>
  <text start="437.55" dur="5.31">Orwellian control over what we say they</text>
  <text start="440.46" dur="4.289">can they can dictate speech and they can</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="3.6">change the rules and and ultimately you</text>
  <text start="444.749" dur="3.121">know as you and I talked a little bit</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="3.63">before we got on this interview there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.87" dur="3.419">the top-down approach which would be</text>
  <text start="450.09" dur="3.569">legislation and then there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="451.289" dur="4.261">bottom-up approach which would be you</text>
  <text start="453.659" dur="4.44">know people like you or people that are</text>
  <text start="455.55" dur="4.769">in the best situation to bring a suit</text>
  <text start="458.099" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s certainly what Laurel Umar&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.319" dur="3">tried to do because you know I think</text>
  <text start="461.879" dur="3.9">she&amp;#39;s the most being human being there</text>
  <text start="463.319" dur="5.13">is is my understanding one of them yeah</text>
  <text start="465.779" dur="4.771">I&amp;#39;m not low on that rank myself it seems</text>
  <text start="468.449" dur="3.541">and yeah I would like to even while</text>
  <text start="470.55" dur="3.089">we&amp;#39;re talking about this you you brought</text>
  <text start="471.99" dur="3.449">up an interesting point someone who has</text>
  <text start="473.639" dur="3.541">a case it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be my case I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="475.439" dur="4.021">willing to try to back someone else&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="477.18" dur="4.38">case who has a stronger case because</text>
  <text start="479.46" dur="5.069">there are folks out there who have been</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="5.34">censored and it&amp;#39;s a better winning case</text>
  <text start="484.529" dur="4.17">than just some random journalist on on</text>
  <text start="486.9" dur="4.5">YouTube like myself you know people like</text>
  <text start="488.699" dur="5.611">for example Candice Owens I mean she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="4.919">got people at Facebook leaking evidence</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="4.68">to her that they&amp;#39;re outright censoring</text>
  <text start="496.319" dur="4.62">her and trying to segregate her from the</text>
  <text start="498.99" dur="3.57">rest of the Facebook people so things</text>
  <text start="500.939" dur="3.361">like this I think would be stronger</text>
  <text start="502.56" dur="4.56">cases than even myself with the goal</text>
  <text start="504.3" dur="5.31">being of course to actually win yeah</text>
  <text start="507.12" dur="5.579">yeah you know and I think can zones is a</text>
  <text start="509.61" dur="4.169">great example because you know with what</text>
  <text start="512.699" dur="3.15">we&amp;#39;re doing there is you&amp;#39;re targeting</text>
  <text start="513.779" dur="4.32">somebody and and that&amp;#39;s an intentional</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="4.62">act so that might be a way to get around</text>
  <text start="518.099" dur="3.901">the restriction the strictures or the</text>
  <text start="520.469" dur="4.201">restrictions of the Communications</text>
  <text start="522" dur="5.49">Decency Act and so you know people who</text>
  <text start="524.67" dur="6.63">are specifically targeted where they</text>
  <text start="527.49" dur="5.73">didn&amp;#39;t violate any of the policies you</text>
  <text start="531.3" dur="3.539">know they just want to find some</text>
  <text start="533.22" dur="3.27">technical violation you know that that</text>
  <text start="534.839" dur="3.69">certainly would change the equation</text>
  <text start="536.49" dur="4.529">that&amp;#39;s something Laura Loomer may want</text>
  <text start="538.529" dur="4.261">to develop it if her lawsuit gets past</text>
  <text start="541.019" dur="4.471">the early stages is to see to what</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="5.07">extent she was targeted and what extent</text>
  <text start="545.49" dur="5.01">the social media platform or in this</text>
  <text start="547.86" dur="4.95">case I don&amp;#39;t have she&amp;#39;s suing Facebook</text>
  <text start="550.5" dur="4.079">to the extent Facebook kind of made</text>
  <text start="552.81" dur="3.839">stuff up to get rid of her because that</text>
  <text start="554.579" dur="3.601">was their separate agenda that seems to</text>
  <text start="556.649" dur="3.3">be it be a bad faith violation of the</text>
  <text start="558.18" dur="4.2">law and might provide additional</text>
  <text start="559.949" dur="4.231">protections for people and I you know</text>
  <text start="562.38" dur="3.09">it&amp;#39;s hard to believe they seem to have</text>
  <text start="564.18" dur="3.72">codified the ability</text>
  <text start="565.47" dur="4.17">to actually discriminate but on the</text>
  <text start="567.9" dur="3.57">other hand I know of other leaders like</text>
