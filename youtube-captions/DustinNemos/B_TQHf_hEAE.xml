  <text start="122.44" dur="4.41">comes out of town hall reports say James</text>
  <text start="124.869" dur="4.681">Comey is torched in the Department of</text>
  <text start="126.85" dur="6.03">Justice&amp;#39;s AG report on Obama era FISA</text>
  <text start="129.55" dur="5.43">abuses so recently it has been revealed</text>
  <text start="132.88" dur="5.76">that the Department of Justice will not</text>
  <text start="134.98" dur="5.729">be charging James Comey with leaking of</text>
  <text start="138.64" dur="5.7">information because of course he had</text>
  <text start="140.709" dur="6.931">leaked this classified Intel to a friend</text>
  <text start="144.34" dur="4.979">who then leaked it to the media however</text>
  <text start="147.64" dur="5.1">he will not be charged with that now</text>
  <text start="149.319" dur="6.511">this article talks about how even though</text>
  <text start="152.74" dur="5.699">he&amp;#39;s not charged in that he will be</text>
  <text start="155.83" dur="5.519">under quite a bit of fire in the IG</text>
  <text start="158.439" dur="5.681">report that is set to come out soon</text>
  <text start="161.349" dur="7.211">however I would argue that that is not</text>
  <text start="164.12" dur="8.339">the real threat to James Comey so the IG</text>
  <text start="168.56" dur="6.379">report will be revealing but in the</text>
  <text start="172.459" dur="5.161">background there&amp;#39;s also the durham</text>
  <text start="174.939" dur="5.11">investigation going on Hoover is also</text>
  <text start="177.62" dur="4.91">investigating Hoover Durham and William</text>
  <text start="180.049" dur="6.78">Barr are all working together and so</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="7.9">they&amp;#39;re working on looking into the FISA</text>
  <text start="186.829" dur="7.77">abuse that started the whole Russian</text>
  <text start="190.43" dur="6.179">investigation hoax James Comey had a</text>
  <text start="194.599" dur="5.191">major role to play in that he was the</text>
  <text start="196.609" dur="5.96">head of the FBI during this time and he</text>
  <text start="199.79" dur="5.49">had already admitted a while ago that</text>
  <text start="202.569" dur="5.021">the dossier that they used was</text>
  <text start="205.28" dur="6.829">unverified and yet they used it anyway</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="7.769">to move forward so when it comes to that</text>
  <text start="212.109" dur="8.291">he will be in a lot of trouble because</text>
  <text start="215.359" dur="9.871">that is a crime especially since there</text>
  <text start="220.4" dur="8.989">is a lot of evidence to show that this</text>
  <text start="225.23" dur="9">investigation was maliciously operated</text>
  <text start="229.389" dur="7.331">the whole purpose of it was to make it</text>
  <text start="234.23" dur="4.56">appear that President Donald Trump was</text>
  <text start="236.72" dur="3.329">colluding with Russia they wanted to</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="5.159">find something anything</text>
  <text start="240.049" dur="5.55">so they initiated a spy campaign to dig</text>
  <text start="243.949" dur="3.72">up any kind of dirt they could on</text>
  <text start="245.599" dur="4.32">President Trump to prevent him number</text>
  <text start="247.669" dur="5.81">one from becoming president and then</text>
  <text start="249.919" dur="8.511">number two as part of a coup d&amp;#39;etat</text>
  <text start="253.479" dur="9.731">so while James Comey did not get charged</text>
  <text start="258.43" dur="7.39">and convicted with leaking it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="263.21" dur="6.42">Barr says that there wasn&amp;#39;t enough</text>
  <text start="265.82" dur="6.089">evidence to show criminal intent and so</text>
  <text start="269.63" dur="4.14">they didn&amp;#39;t want to bring weak charges</text>
  <text start="271.909" dur="4.801">they want to make sure that when they</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="6.42">bring charges it it does not appear to</text>
  <text start="276.71" dur="6.81">be malicious or politically motivated in</text>
  <text start="280.19" dur="7.229">any kind of way because it&amp;#39;s weak it</text>
  <text start="283.52" dur="7.769">doesn&amp;#39;t have enough evidence behind it</text>
  <text start="287.419" dur="6.541">so it&amp;#39;s likely that even though he</text>
  <text start="291.289" dur="3.811">hasn&amp;#39;t been charged with leaking there</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="4.38">are more</text>
  <text start="295.1" dur="5.25">serious charges around the bend so he is</text>
  <text start="298.34" dur="6.48">not out of the woods just yet and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="300.35" dur="6.51">be following this very closely related</text>
  <text start="304.82" dur="4.35">to that coming out of the Gateway</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="4.68">Punnett breaking Durham investigators</text>
  <text start="309.17" dur="3.77">have obtained an audiotape deposition of</text>
  <text start="311.54" dur="5.79">Joseph Mifsud</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="7.24">so we&amp;#39;ve been told recently that a lot</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="4.95">of the material evidence will be rolled</text>
  <text start="320.18" dur="5.13">out very soon and that they&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="322.28" dur="6.03">available for the public so one of these</text>
  <text start="325.31" dur="5.82">things now apparently is the audio tape</text>
  <text start="328.31" dur="5.4">deposition is now in the hands of Durham</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="5.16">and of course now that is going to be</text>
  <text start="333.71" dur="4.8">added in with all of the evidence to</text>
  <text start="336.29" dur="3.39">show the origins of this Russian</text>
  <text start="338.51" dur="3.89">investigation hoax</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="6.69">Joseph Mifsud he is this mysterious</text>
  <text start="342.4" dur="6.55">professor who could be at the root of</text>
  <text start="346.37" dur="4.23">this whole thing he was the source of</text>
  <text start="348.95" dur="5.52">the information were charged by</text>
  <text start="350.6" dur="6.09">Papadopoulos had been told that the</text>
  <text start="354.47" dur="3.17">Russians had dirt on the Hillary</text>
  <text start="356.69" dur="8.16">campaign</text>
  <text start="357.64" dur="10.09">so this Joseph Mifsud was interviewed by</text>
  <text start="364.85" dur="5.61">Muller and was found to have lied and</text>
  <text start="367.73" dur="5.79">yet he was not charged and so Jim Jordan</text>
  <text start="370.46" dur="8.31">had grilled Muller during his testimony</text>
  <text start="373.52" dur="8.04">last week about why he did not charge</text>
  <text start="378.77" dur="6.21">Joseph Mifsud with a crime because there</text>
  <text start="381.56" dur="6.27">were so many others who were charged</text>
  <text start="384.98" dur="6.78">with lying even ones who hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="387.83" dur="7.65">including general Flint so why wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="391.76" dur="5.64">this guy charged with a crime because he</text>
  <text start="395.48" dur="6.33">was found to have lied at least three</text>
  <text start="397.4" dur="6.57">times according to the report so now</text>
  <text start="401.81" dur="4.35">this deposition is in the hands of</text>
  <text start="403.97" dur="5.91">Durham who is running the criminal</text>
  <text start="406.16" dur="9.6">investigation not the IG report not the</text>
  <text start="409.88" dur="7.82">review but the criminal investigation so</text>
  <text start="415.76" dur="5.16">this should be interesting</text>
  <text start="417.7" dur="6.55">all right next up also coming out of the</text>
  <text start="420.92" dur="5.19">Gateway Punnett Trump is in the middle</text>
  <text start="424.25" dur="4.11">of talks with the Taliban trying to</text>
  <text start="426.11" dur="5.309">negotiate with them he is work</text>
  <text start="428.36" dur="4.44">on bringing back at least half of the</text>
  <text start="431.419" dur="4.71">troops that are over there right now</text>
  <text start="432.8" dur="5.28">right now in Afghanistan we have 14,000</text>
  <text start="436.129" dur="4.29">troops he wants to bring back 8,000 of</text>
  <text start="438.08" dur="4.679">those at least so he is in the middle of</text>
  <text start="440.419" dur="4.381">toxis is a developing story so we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="442.759" dur="5.25">have any further details right now now</text>
  <text start="444.8" dur="5.85">of course there are those who will</text>
  <text start="448.009" dur="4.141">probably say that negotiating with the</text>
  <text start="450.65" dur="4.199">Taliban is a bad thing</text>
  <text start="452.15" dur="4.71">so most notably it&amp;#39;s likely the</text>
  <text start="454.849" dur="4.62">Democrats who will say this these are</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="6.239">the same people of course who say that</text>
  <text start="459.469" dur="7.861">they don&amp;#39;t want war that they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="463.099" dur="6.66">us to have troops everywhere and that we</text>
  <text start="467.33" dur="4.5">should bring them back but yet at the</text>
  <text start="469.759" dur="4.38">same time they will oppose President</text>
  <text start="471.83" dur="8.149">Trump when he tries to pull back our</text>
  <text start="474.139" dur="8.631">troops so which is it which do you want</text>
  <text start="479.979" dur="5.56">so President Trump has always been</text>
  <text start="482.77" dur="6.429">rather against the interventionist</text>
  <text start="485.539" dur="5.461">policy so he feels that we need to bring</text>
  <text start="489.199" dur="4.44">back the troops which is true we have</text>
  <text start="491" dur="4.77">had our boots on the ground in places</text>
  <text start="493.639" dur="5.761">that we don&amp;#39;t belong for too long now</text>
  <text start="495.77" dur="6.03">and we need to bring them back so now he</text>
  <text start="499.4" dur="7.109">is making moves towards ensuring that</text>
  <text start="501.8" dur="6.899">those people can come back all right</text>
  <text start="506.509" dur="4.77">next up this one is coming out of the</text>
  <text start="508.699" dur="4.47">griot two mothers who advocated against</text>
  <text start="511.279" dur="4.17">gun violence slain and drive-by shooting</text>
  <text start="513.169" dur="6.78">of course this is in the south side of</text>
  <text start="515.449" dur="7.851">Chicago Chicago is one of the most</text>
  <text start="519.949" dur="9.111">dangerous places in the entire country</text>
  <text start="523.3" dur="10.42">so while groups like black lives matter</text>
  <text start="529.06" dur="8.95">like to hold protests actually more not</text>
  <text start="533.72" dur="7.77">protests they are really rioting against</text>
  <text start="538.01" dur="6.09">their own cities screaming about police</text>
  <text start="541.49" dur="6.08">brutality when they don&amp;#39;t want to talk</text>
  <text start="544.1" dur="8.669">about black-on-black crime and</text>
  <text start="547.57" dur="9.22">especially not in Chicago in Chicago it</text>
  <text start="552.769" dur="8.07">is such a common place there was a time</text>
  <text start="556.79" dur="4.859">when there were gun crimes at the rate</text>
  <text start="560.839" dur="4.8">of</text>
  <text start="561.649" dur="8.451">seventy-five in one weekend seventy-five</text>
  <text start="565.639" dur="10.471">gun deaths in a weekend that is an</text>
  <text start="570.1" dur="7.899">incredible number why they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="3.99">talking about this why it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="577.999" dur="4.62">plastered all over mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="580.1" dur="4.26">beyond me actually it&amp;#39;s not the reason</text>
  <text start="582.619" dur="7.351">why it&amp;#39;s not is because it doesn&amp;#39;t fit</text>
  <text start="584.36" dur="8.37">their narrative they only want people to</text>
  <text start="589.97" dur="5.07">focus on police brutality because the</text>
  <text start="592.73" dur="5.669">way they can spin it is that it somehow</text>
  <text start="595.04" dur="6.69">has something to do with race and racial</text>
  <text start="598.399" dur="5.61">division that is the narrative they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="601.73" dur="4.44">trying to push they don&amp;#39;t care really</text>
  <text start="604.009" dur="6.33">about gun violence because if they did</text>
  <text start="606.17" dur="8.55">they would focus on real gun violence</text>
  <text start="610.339" dur="8.22">which happens in these inner cities like</text>
  <text start="614.72" dur="6.27">Chicago like Baltimore in fact there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="618.559" dur="5.37">another report that says a study shows</text>
  <text start="620.99" dur="5.819">that Baltimore you are more likely to be</text>
  <text start="623.929" dur="8.16">murdered in Baltimore than you are in</text>
  <text start="626.809" dur="7.14">Central America it has been known for</text>
  <text start="632.089" dur="5.761">years that Baltimore is a dangerous</text>
  <text start="633.949" dur="6.33">place but yet as soon as President Trump</text>
  <text start="637.85" dur="8.599">says something about how dangerous it is</text>
  <text start="640.279" dur="6.17">and how corrupt it is they scream race</text>
  <text start="647.17" dur="4.479">that is the car they pull when they</text>
  <text start="649.37" dur="6.42">don&amp;#39;t want the public to really look at</text>
  <text start="651.649" dur="5.94">reality so these two women the mothers</text>
  <text start="655.79" dur="5.489">who died in this drive-by shooting</text>
  <text start="657.589" dur="7.73">they have been working against gun</text>
  <text start="661.279" dur="4.04">violence in their community for years</text>
  <text start="665.949" dur="6.671">for years so they were actually</text>
  <text start="669.049" dur="6.061">ironically killed on the very block that</text>
  <text start="672.62" dur="6.54">they have been protesting on this whole</text>
  <text start="675.11" dur="7.019">time working against gun violence and</text>
  <text start="679.16" dur="4.44">yet they died at the hands of a gun</text>
  <text start="682.129" dur="3.721">drive-by shooting they didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="683.6" dur="7.31">apprehend a suspect they have no suspect</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="5.06">because gun violence is so common</text>
  <text start="691.769" dur="7.81">this is a problem and it needs to be</text>
  <text start="694.449" dur="9.33">looked at all right next up speaking of</text>
  <text start="699.579" dur="7.98">violence in brutality so right now there</text>
  <text start="703.779" dur="5.67">is a gentleman by the name of Johnny Wu</text>
  <text start="707.559" dur="5.78">or at least that&amp;#39;s how he&amp;#39;s known on</text>
  <text start="709.449" dur="10.2">Facebook he says that he was attacked</text>
  <text start="713.339" dur="10.84">for wearing a mag aha now the story</text>
  <text start="719.649" dur="6.39">doesn&amp;#39;t really add up to me I will say</text>
  <text start="724.179" dur="6.09">this before I even comment on this</text>
  <text start="726.039" dur="9.36">article whatsoever there is plenty of</text>
  <text start="730.269" dur="11.87">evidence out there that there is a lot</text>
  <text start="735.399" dur="10.62">of violence against Trump supporters and</text>
  <text start="742.139" dur="7.45">this violence is really justified by the</text>
  <text start="746.019" dur="8.85">left and this is really evident by the</text>
  <text start="749.589" dur="12.36">fact that they fail to condemn groups</text>
  <text start="754.869" dur="11.76">like antiva who are very open about</text>
  <text start="761.949" dur="7.08">their intent to harm those who disagree</text>
  <text start="766.629" dur="8.88">with them which for the most part are</text>
  <text start="769.029" dur="11.88">conservatives we see people attacked for</text>
  <text start="775.509" dur="11.73">wearing hats at restaurants at stores in</text>
  <text start="780.909" dur="11.57">the middle of the street at rallies this</text>
  <text start="787.239" dur="11.34">does happen so I will say that I</text>
  <text start="792.479" dur="10.09">recognize this is a problem that there</text>
  <text start="798.579" dur="9.84">is violence against Trump supporters</text>
  <text start="802.569" dur="11.66">simply for supporting Trump this is a</text>
  <text start="808.419" dur="5.81">real thing it is a real problem however</text>
  <text start="815.159" dur="6.6">to me with this story there seems to be</text>
  <text start="821.91" dur="6.95">some red flags going up for me I really</text>
  <text start="825.36" dur="5.459">don&amp;#39;t know if this story is legitimate</text>
  <text start="828.86" dur="4.27">you can tell me what you think in the</text>
  <text start="830.819" dur="7.981">comments below but just let me state my</text>
  <text start="833.13" dur="7.8">case so this man he says that he was</text>
  <text start="838.8" dur="4.229">attacked by a mob of 15 teenagers</text>
  <text start="840.93" dur="5.45">shouting F Trump for wearing a Maggie</text>
  <text start="843.029" dur="6.331">hat in Manhattan now he also says that</text>
  <text start="846.38" dur="6.31">he bought the Hat at Trump Tower and</text>
  <text start="849.36" dur="6.24">almost didn&amp;#39;t wear it because he knew</text>
  <text start="852.69" dur="5.25">that it was dangerous to wear it</text>
  <text start="855.6" dur="8.789">something like that in the middle of</text>
  <text start="857.94" dur="8.43">Manhattan so why did he wear it then was</text>
  <text start="864.389" dur="4.89">he asking for trouble because he</text>
  <text start="866.37" dur="4.199">obviously had a feeling that that might</text>
  <text start="869.279" dur="5.79">happen or at least that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="870.569" dur="7.44">saying also at the same time when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="875.069" dur="5.19">talking about what they were saying he</text>
  <text start="878.009" dur="8.19">said that they were chanting F Trump and</text>
  <text start="880.259" dur="7.651">quote some other anti Trump stuff that</text>
  <text start="886.199" dur="4.591">could be anything so you don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="887.91" dur="5.58">what they were saying also which is</text>
  <text start="890.79" dur="6.359">possible but I&amp;#39;m taking all of these</text>
  <text start="893.49" dur="6.51">things together also he says that when</text>
  <text start="897.149" dur="4.651">the authorities arrived the kids were</text>
  <text start="900" dur="5.399">still there and they were still chanting</text>
  <text start="901.8" dur="9.959">all of this stuff yet all of that is</text>
  <text start="905.399" dur="9.24">absent from the police report why now</text>
  <text start="911.759" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;ll tell you my final point why I think</text>
  <text start="914.639" dur="4.591">that there might be something a little</text>
  <text start="916.889" dur="8.491">bit fishy about this whole thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="919.23" dur="11.279">the timing so right now we have the</text>
  <text start="925.38" dur="7.519">smollett case really ongoing so even</text>
  <text start="930.509" dur="7.231">though all 16 charges were dropped</text>
  <text start="932.899" dur="8.17">against Jessie Smollett they are now in</text>
  <text start="937.74" dur="6.3">they have now enlisted a special</text>
  <text start="941.069" dur="6.33">prosecutor to investigate Kim Fox who</text>
  <text start="944.04" dur="6.21">dropped those charges then at the same</text>
  <text start="947.399" dur="6.121">time that would allow them to reopen the</text>
  <text start="950.25" dur="7.3">case against Jessie Smollett</text>
  <text start="953.52" dur="6.76">they tried to appeal this they tried to</text>
  <text start="957.55" dur="5.94">have the special prosecutor not</text>
  <text start="960.28" dur="5.55">appointed but it did not work so now</text>
  <text start="963.49" dur="4.71">they&amp;#39;re moving forward with this special</text>
  <text start="965.83" dur="6.48">prosecutor which really spells trouble</text>
  <text start="968.2" dur="7.86">for Kim Fox and Jesse Smollett now Jesse</text>
  <text start="972.31" dur="7.86">Smollett he had staged a hate crime</text>
  <text start="976.06" dur="7.32">against himself and now he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="980.17" dur="6.39">exposed and now that also brings to</text>
  <text start="983.38" dur="11.46">question some of these other alleged</text>
  <text start="986.56" dur="13.89">attacks of hate so this could possibly</text>
  <text start="994.84" dur="10.56">be set up so that they can later come</text>
  <text start="1000.45" dur="10.29">back and discredit any claim that Trump</text>
  <text start="1005.4" dur="8.19">supporters are being attacked because if</text>
  <text start="1010.74" dur="5.52">if I&amp;#39;m right and this is not really a</text>
  <text start="1013.59" dur="8.88">legitimate thing then they can come back</text>
  <text start="1016.26" dur="10.35">and say this was a false crime a false</text>
  <text start="1022.47" dur="12.96">claim this guy lied and he made up the</text>
  <text start="1026.61" dur="12.78">whole thing then that looks bad on Trump</text>
  <text start="1035.43" dur="7.32">supporters so they&amp;#39;re trying to this</text>
  <text start="1039.39" dur="8.189">could be an angle to try to turn the</text>
  <text start="1042.75" dur="7.26">tables so tell me what you think about</text>
  <text start="1047.579" dur="4.741">that that&amp;#39;s just my analysis of the</text>
  <text start="1050.01" dur="4.41">situation so I will be following this</text>
  <text start="1052.32" dur="3.24">story to see where it goes but let me</text>
  <text start="1054.42" dur="6.42">know what you think in the comments</text>
  <text start="1055.56" dur="7.89">below all right next up the feds just</text>
  <text start="1060.84" dur="5.4">arrested Isis most-wanted human</text>
  <text start="1063.45" dur="5.1">trafficking suspect 50 year-old Derrick</text>
  <text start="1066.24" dur="5.37">Bell was arrested on Wednesday at an</text>
  <text start="1068.55" dur="6.45">Econo Lodge in Detroit he was found with</text>
  <text start="1071.61" dur="5.55">cocaine $12,000 in cash and a young</text>
  <text start="1075" dur="4.95">woman was also with him who was also</text>
  <text start="1077.16" dur="5.18">apprehended now he is being charged with</text>
  <text start="1079.95" dur="4.68">five others with nine different</text>
  <text start="1082.34" dur="3.43">indictments including a money laundering</text>
  <text start="1084.63" dur="3">drug trafficking</text>
  <text start="1085.77" dur="5.31">human trafficking extortion and</text>
  <text start="1087.63" dur="5.34">conspiracy as well as others now he had</text>
  <text start="1091.08" dur="4.35">been running the operation out of a</text>
  <text start="1092.97" dur="4.14">Detroit hotel and he allegedly had been</text>
  <text start="1095.43" dur="3.54">drugging women and then forcing them</text>
  <text start="1097.11" dur="5.22">into commercial sex acts through</text>
  <text start="1098.97" dur="5.79">coercion threats and isolation so he has</text>
  <text start="1102.33" dur="6.54">been on the run since January 2017 and</text>
  <text start="1104.76" dur="6.6">he was on Isis most-wanted list so this</text>
  <text start="1108.87" dur="5.82">is a big-time bust right here and we are</text>
  <text start="1111.36" dur="10.29">glad that he is off the street all right</text>
  <text start="1114.69" dur="10.62">next up Rashida Talib she is under fire</text>
  <text start="1121.65" dur="8.16">once again so now she apparently</text>
  <text start="1125.31" dur="10.41">received donations from a man who had</text>
  <text start="1129.81" dur="7.77">died 10 years prior now this isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="1135.72" dur="5.25">first time she is coming under</text>
  <text start="1137.58" dur="6.84">accusations of fraud but of course her</text>
  <text start="1140.97" dur="5.7">communications director is saying that</text>
  <text start="1144.42" dur="4.77">the reason why she received this</text>
  <text start="1146.67" dur="7.05">donation was because it actually came</text>
  <text start="1149.19" dur="7.53">from the man&amp;#39;s Widow well why didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1153.72" dur="5.97">that why wasn&amp;#39;t that donation made under</text>
  <text start="1156.72" dur="8.58">her name then it could have easily went</text>
  <text start="1159.69" dur="12.54">under her name well I&amp;#39;m wondering if</text>
  <text start="1165.3" dur="10.38">it&amp;#39;s because she needed unique donors to</text>
  <text start="1172.23" dur="4.83">run and I&amp;#39;ll have to look into this a</text>
  <text start="1175.68" dur="3.36">little bit further but I know for</text>
  <text start="1177.06" dur="8.49">presidential candidates you need a</text>
  <text start="1179.04" dur="9.51">certain number of unique donors so why</text>
  <text start="1185.55" dur="5.64">would the widow not just donate the</text>
  <text start="1188.55" dur="5.76">money under her own name perhaps she</text>
  <text start="1191.19" dur="5.43">donated money under her name then she</text>
  <text start="1194.31" dur="4.5">donated money under his name so that</text>
  <text start="1196.62" dur="4.96">that way they could have two unique</text>
  <text start="1198.81" dur="5.3">donors instead of one</text>
  <text start="1201.58" dur="6.4">so they&amp;#39;ll be looking into this a lot</text>
  <text start="1204.11" dur="7.26">more hopefully because this corruption</text>
  <text start="1207.98" dur="9.78">has to stop there is plenty of evidence</text>
  <text start="1211.37" dur="9.66">at this point that she has engaged in</text>
  <text start="1217.76" dur="8.43">fraud and criminal activity in order to</text>
  <text start="1221.03" dur="9.48">gain her position so she should vacate</text>
  <text start="1226.19" dur="7.17">that position immediately speaking of</text>
  <text start="1230.51" dur="5.39">corruption tulsi gabbard actually called</text>
  <text start="1233.36" dur="5.97">out Kamala Harris at Wednesday night&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1235.9" dur="7.42">debates really highlighting the fact</text>
  <text start="1239.33" dur="7.08">that Kamala Harris during her time as</text>
  <text start="1243.32" dur="6.12">state prosecutor had abused her power</text>
  <text start="1246.41" dur="5.85">there that she had blocked evidence that</text>
  <text start="1249.44" dur="5.63">could be used to free people who were on</text>
  <text start="1252.26" dur="6">death row who were possibly innocent and</text>
  <text start="1255.07" dur="5.05">she blocked the evidence until she was</text>
  <text start="1258.26" dur="6.09">forced to hand it over</text>
  <text start="1260.12" dur="7.89">also she had kept people in prison</text>
  <text start="1264.35" dur="9.69">beyond their term in order to really</text>
  <text start="1268.01" dur="7.86">benefit from the cheaper labor so Tulsi</text>
  <text start="1274.04" dur="5.85">Gabbard called out a number of things</text>
  <text start="1275.87" dur="7.2">and really that was a major hit on</text>
  <text start="1279.89" dur="5.64">Kamala Harris and now of course they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1283.07" dur="6.21">coming out saying that it&amp;#39;s the Russians</text>
  <text start="1285.53" dur="7.5">the Russians are behind Tulsi Gabbard</text>
  <text start="1289.28" dur="6.69">now because she said the truth she told</text>
  <text start="1293.03" dur="6">the truth she called out Kamala Harris</text>
  <text start="1295.97" dur="5.55">for corruption and now they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1299.03" dur="5.82">that the Russians are behind it because</text>
  <text start="1301.52" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s always the go-to response because</text>
  <text start="1304.85" dur="6.38">when Hillary Clinton was being exposed</text>
  <text start="1306.95" dur="6.599">during her campaign in 2016 they also</text>
  <text start="1311.23" dur="4.569">said that it was the Russians it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1313.549" dur="7.141">always the Russians when conservatives</text>
  <text start="1315.799" dur="9.361">go on social media and post facts they</text>
  <text start="1320.69" dur="7.83">are called Russian BOTS we are not</text>
  <text start="1325.16" dur="7.44">Russian BOTS we&amp;#39;re here to keep a</text>
  <text start="1328.52" dur="7.34">spotlight on your corruption until you</text>
  <text start="1332.6" dur="3.26">leave office</text>
  <text start="1335.89" dur="6.64">that is really what is happening not</text>
  <text start="1339.49" dur="7.65">some conspiracy where Russians are</text>
  <text start="1342.53" dur="10.89">constantly always behind the exposure of</text>
  <text start="1347.14" dur="8.44">corruption so this is rather interesting</text>
  <text start="1353.42" dur="4.259">and now they&amp;#39;re going to say that tulsi</text>
  <text start="1355.58" dur="5.04">gabbard is being pushed by the russians</text>
  <text start="1357.679" dur="5.13">now that&amp;#39;s the new narrative okay next</text>
  <text start="1360.62" dur="5.13">up in corruption Baltimore home of</text>
  <text start="1362.809" dur="5.071">Elijah Cummings was broken into so of</text>
  <text start="1365.75" dur="4.23">course you know there&amp;#39;s this battle</text>
  <text start="1367.88" dur="3.929">going on between Elijah Cummings and</text>
  <text start="1369.98" dur="5.04">president Trump over president Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1371.809" dur="7.191">statements regarding Baltimore which is</text>
  <text start="1375.02" dur="7.02">Elijah Cummings district so Trump had</text>
  <text start="1379" dur="6.46">said what everybody else is aware of</text>
  <text start="1382.04" dur="5.31">that Baltimore is a horrible place and</text>
  <text start="1385.46" dur="3.9">that most people don&amp;#39;t want to live</text>
  <text start="1387.35" dur="4.05">there this is true it&amp;#39;s a dangerous</text>
  <text start="1389.36" dur="4.68">place to live there&amp;#39;s a lot of crime</text>
  <text start="1391.4" dur="6.39">there well right before the Twitter</text>
  <text start="1394.04" dur="7.139">storm Elijah Cummings his home was</text>
  <text start="1397.79" dur="7.35">actually broken into that previous</text>
  <text start="1401.179" dur="6.12">weekend now they say that it&amp;#39;s unclear</text>
  <text start="1405.14" dur="3.779">whether or not Elijah Cummings was home</text>
  <text start="1407.299" dur="6.541">when this happened even though it</text>
  <text start="1408.919" dur="8.211">occurred at 3:40 in the morning most</text>
  <text start="1413.84" dur="7.32">people are home at 3:40 in the morning</text>
  <text start="1417.13" dur="7.59">so why wouldn&amp;#39;t you be there what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1421.16" dur="7.009">interesting about this is the fact that</text>
  <text start="1424.72" dur="7.24">Elijah Cummings and his wife are</text>
  <text start="1428.169" dur="7.931">currently being looked at for their</text>
  <text start="1431.96" dur="8.25">involvement possibly in some very</text>
  <text start="1436.1" dur="7.53">sketchy financial dealings between his</text>
  <text start="1440.21" dur="8.76">wife&amp;#39;s nonprofit organization and her</text>
  <text start="1443.63" dur="8.34">private company and of course donors to</text>
  <text start="1448.97" dur="10.77">that company actually have interests</text>
  <text start="1451.97" dur="9.87">before Elijah Cummings so there is some</text>
  <text start="1459.74" dur="4.57">very suspicious activity going on there</text>
  <text start="1461.84" dur="6.67">and it&amp;#39;s being investigated right</text>
  <text start="1464.31" dur="6.21">so what was taken from the home when it</text>
  <text start="1468.51" dur="8.88">was allegedly broken into was it</text>
  <text start="1470.52" dur="8.51">evidence possibly the timing is rather</text>
  <text start="1477.39" dur="4.74">convenient</text>
  <text start="1479.03" dur="4.96">all right last up Robert F Kennedy</text>
  <text start="1482.13" dur="4.86">granddaughter reportedly dies at</text>
  <text start="1483.99" dur="6.24">compound in Massachusetts so the</text>
  <text start="1486.99" dur="5.91">granddaughter of robber F Kennedy who is</text>
  <text start="1490.23" dur="6.36">22 years old was found dead of an</text>
  <text start="1492.9" dur="6.03">apparent overdose at the Kennedy</text>
  <text start="1496.59" dur="4.98">compound in Massachusetts now of course</text>
  <text start="1498.93" dur="5.61">this compound was considered the summer</text>
  <text start="1501.57" dur="10.02">White House during the time of john f</text>
  <text start="1504.54" dur="10.74">kennedy&amp;#39;s presidency now i don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1511.59" dur="6.65">whether or not there&amp;#39;s foul play here</text>
  <text start="1515.28" dur="9.66">because there&amp;#39;s not enough evidence</text>
  <text start="1518.24" dur="12.81">although i would say that if there was</text>
  <text start="1524.94" dur="6.11">any kind of evidence against the CIA</text>
  <text start="1531.77" dur="4.78">especially during the time of John F</text>
  <text start="1534.03" dur="9.24">Kennedy I would assume there might be</text>
  <text start="1536.55" dur="8.49">some at that compound so I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="1543.27" dur="4.71">say anything further about this right</text>
  <text start="1545.04" dur="5.55">now I will be following this story very</text>
  <text start="1547.98" dur="4.92">close to see where it goes because they</text>
  <text start="1550.59" dur="3.63">are investigating it right now even</text>
  <text start="1552.9" dur="3.06">though they have already come out and</text>
  <text start="1554.22" dur="3.9">say that it&amp;#39;s at a parent overdose they</text>
