  <text start="371.199" dur="3.931">it&amp;#39;s easy to hide weapons out in the</text>

  <text start="394.449" dur="3.09">very accurate and modern technology you</text>
  <text start="396.13" dur="3.029">can make your own by just ordering the</text>
  <text start="397.539" dur="2.801">lowers and doing the drilling which is</text>
  <text start="399.159" dur="4.451">fairly easy there&amp;#39;s a bunch of D</text>
  <text start="400.34" dur="5.28">videos even using a knife on police to</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="3.75">take their guns which is very simple -</text>
  <text start="405.62" dur="3.21">no one ever expects you to just walk up</text>
  <text start="407.36" dur="3.33">smiling at them and put a knife in their</text>
  <text start="408.83" dur="4.86">ribs but that is easy to do for a</text>

  <text start="1087.53" dur="3.18">uses that the other side would then use</text>
  <text start="1088.789" dur="3.091">it but all that really happens at that</text>
  <text start="1090.71" dur="2.73">point is people just can&amp;#39;t hurt each</text>
  <text start="1091.88" dur="3.51">other I mean if you throw a bomb into a</text>
  <text start="1093.44" dur="4.65">crowd of somebody wearing a triple wall</text>
  <text start="1095.39" dur="4.68">polycarbonate armor suit they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1098.09" dur="4.02">probably not gonna get hurt</text>
  <text start="1100.07" dur="6.03">concussion ear damage that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="1102.11" dur="5.52">possibly but if you throw rocks at</text>
  <text start="1106.1" dur="3.36">someone hit their motorcycle helmet</text>
  <text start="1107.63" dur="5.1">probably won&amp;#39;t hurt them same with this</text>
  <text start="1109.46" dur="6.15">armor if you I mean if you were doing</text>
  <text start="1112.73" dur="5.16">knife knife work in a crowd you could go</text>
  <text start="1115.61" dur="4.319">in in two seams and armpits and stuff</text>
  <text start="1117.89" dur="7.289">with the armor may not protect but for</text>
  <text start="1119.929" dur="7.11">most things bullets you know poles</text>
  <text start="1125.179" dur="3.661">painted as as plastic when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1127.039" dur="3.571">really metal or wouldn&amp;#39;t the kind of</text>
  <text start="1128.84" dur="3.3">stuff that anti felt likes to do you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1130.61" dur="4.08">basically be immune to that I mean this</text>
  <text start="1132.14" dur="4.019">stuff I think would do a very good job</text>
  <text start="1134.69" dur="4.2">in a very light weight body armor and</text>
  <text start="1136.159" dur="4.801">very affordable so that&amp;#39;s one idea I</text>
  <text start="1138.89" dur="3.6">mentioned it in a video I did earlier if</text>
  <text start="1140.96" dur="3.27">people liked that idea I would really</text>
  <text start="1142.49" dur="3.059">appreciate it if you could spread it</text>
  <text start="1144.23" dur="3.689">among the people who actually go to</text>
  <text start="1145.549" dur="3.781">these events you know I&amp;#39;ve got friends</text>
  <text start="1147.919" dur="3.211">that do that I will share it with them</text>
  <text start="1149.33" dur="3.18">as well because those are the people</text>
  <text start="1151.13" dur="3.06">that will be most interested in this of</text>
  <text start="1152.51" dur="3.12">course it would be fun to have a suit at</text>
  <text start="1154.19" dur="4.92">home as well just in case you ever need</text>
  <text start="1155.63" dur="5.49">to protect yourself but this is the kind</text>
  <text start="1159.11" dur="3.449">of more advanced technology thanks to</text>
  <text start="1161.12" dur="4.11">these new plastics I mean this stuff&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1162.559" dur="6.36">like a hundred or possibly a thousand</text>
  <text start="1165.23" dur="5.04">times stronger than tempered glass it</text>
  <text start="1168.919" dur="3.99">can stop bullets you can look at videos</text>
  <text start="1170.27" dur="4.11">of polycarbonate you know making it</text>
  <text start="1172.909" dur="3.921">pretty might be another thing but making</text>
  <text start="1174.38" dur="6">it effective I think would would be easy</text>
  <text start="1176.83" dur="5.2">and beyond that people could do it at</text>
  <text start="1180.38" dur="3.57">home for themselves I also wanted to</text>
  <text start="1182.03" dur="9.48">talk a little bit about the debate I</text>
  <text start="1183.95" dur="9.359">proposed that we use Titus Frost&amp;#39;s as my</text>
  <text start="1191.51" dur="2.36">first proposal I think was Jordan and</text>
  <text start="1193.309" dur="1.791">they didn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1193.87" dur="3.9">because they thought he was Pro accused</text>
  <text start="1195.1" dur="5.43">so I suggested Titus Frost who is a very</text>
  <text start="1197.77" dur="4.5">much anti Q I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="1200.53" dur="4.32">really matters too much because a mods</text>
  <text start="1202.27" dur="3.539">job is basically to count like are you</text>
  <text start="1204.85" dur="2.76">have three minutes you have three</text>
  <text start="1205.809" dur="3.271">minutes to rebut you have three minutes</text>
  <text start="1207.61" dur="3.27">to make your your point and then you</text>
  <text start="1209.08" dur="5.19">have three minutes to respond that kind</text>
  <text start="1210.88" dur="4.56">of thing and maybe keep crosstalk downs</text>
  <text start="1214.27" dur="2.88">like they are not allowed to interrupt</text>
  <text start="1215.44" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;re allowed to say your piece and</text>
  <text start="1217.15" dur="5.76">maybe just call out obvious BS like</text>
  <text start="1220.42" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t use insults stick to what</text>
  <text start="1222.91" dur="3.93">your proof is that kind of stuff and I</text>
  <text start="1224.86" dur="3.69">think you can do that as a biased person</text>
  <text start="1226.84" dur="4.41">and I think Titus is honest and would do</text>
  <text start="1228.55" dur="4.53">so so you know I don&amp;#39;t know him that</text>
  <text start="1231.25" dur="4.23">well maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong but I think that he</text>
  <text start="1233.08" dur="4.26">would so you know given him the benefit</text>
  <text start="1235.48" dur="3.72">of the doubt and frankly if the three of</text>
  <text start="1237.34" dur="4.29">them turn on me I&amp;#39;m not any more worried</text>
  <text start="1239.2" dur="3.78">than then if the two of them were</text>
  <text start="1241.63" dur="3.57">turning on me because I still have</text>
  <text start="1242.98" dur="4.02">evidence and I still have proof and I</text>
  <text start="1245.2" dur="3.81">still have the argument and that is all</text>
  <text start="1247" dur="3.179">that matters to me and that&amp;#39;s all that</text>
  <text start="1249.01" dur="3.06">should matter to people who are</text>
  <text start="1250.179" dur="4.231">intellectually honest and not doing this</text>
  <text start="1252.07" dur="4.32">to lie and be a show as some people who</text>
  <text start="1254.41" dur="4.11">are obviously lying about things that</text>
  <text start="1256.39" dur="3.18">they know better such as the painter guv</text>
  <text start="1258.52" dur="5.07">and the existence of the civil</text>
