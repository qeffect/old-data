  <text start="128.25" dur="3.959">House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="5.13">says Comey and McCabe will face criminal</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="4.821">charges for attempted coup now this is</text>
  <text start="134.94" dur="5.61">very interesting because at this point</text>
  <text start="137.03" dur="6.19">it&amp;#39;s known at least by the general</text>
  <text start="140.55" dur="5.64">public that McCabe is facing charges but</text>
  <text start="143.22" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s for his role in leaking out</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="4.95">information regarding the Hillary email</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="4.95">case but the rest of us know that he had</text>
  <text start="151.14" dur="6.48">a very significant role in this whole</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="7.289">spy gate scandal where FISA warrants</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="5.52">were illegally obtained in order to spy</text>
  <text start="160.379" dur="5.791">on American citizens so that they could</text>
  <text start="163.14" dur="4.98">a false narrative that then-candidate</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="4.35">Trump now president Trump and his</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="7.35">campaign team had colluded with Russians</text>
  <text start="170.52" dur="7.71">in order to alter the election which</text>
  <text start="175.47" dur="10.71">wasn&amp;#39;t the case and in fact the opposite</text>
  <text start="178.23" dur="10.38">is true so this is a big deal and when</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;re talking about a coup this is</text>
  <text start="188.61" dur="4.5">treason</text>
  <text start="189.33" dur="9.84">and the consequence for that is very</text>
  <text start="193.11" dur="11.24">serious now we just had the preliminary</text>
  <text start="199.17" dur="9.21">the draft of the IG report come out so</text>
  <text start="204.35" dur="6.31">they are pretty much wrapping up this</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="5.15">case at this point so and again like I</text>
  <text start="210.66" dur="6.99">had said before the IG report itself is</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="8.08">really just supplementary material but</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="7.8">at the same time we have Durham and his</text>
  <text start="221.61" dur="6.39">team they are conducting an</text>
  <text start="225.45" dur="7.53">investigation as well into the origins</text>
  <text start="228" dur="9.14">of the whole Russian investigation which</text>
  <text start="232.98" dur="7.979">involves how they obtained the FISA and</text>
  <text start="237.14" dur="9.069">the FBI had a very significant role in</text>
  <text start="240.959" dur="9.361">all of this so these people should be</text>
  <text start="246.209" dur="8.191">getting very very nervous because the</text>
  <text start="250.32" dur="6.63">evidence is going to show that those</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="5.91">FISA warrants were obtained illegally</text>
  <text start="256.95" dur="5.969">this was an attempted coup didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="4.02">wasn&amp;#39;t successful they don&amp;#39;t have a very</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="4.651">good track record they couldn&amp;#39;t succeed</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="7.22">in getting him out of office and also</text>
  <text start="267.57" dur="3.98">they couldn&amp;#39;t even win a rigged election</text>
  <text start="272.69" dur="12.55">now what I find interesting is that trey</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="9.78">Gowdy is now cowering away from the</text>
  <text start="285.24" dur="6.39">whole idea of people being held</text>
  <text start="287.55" dur="6.989">accountable for this attempted coup so</text>
  <text start="291.63" dur="4.099">trey gowdy had showed up on sean hannity</text>
  <text start="294.539" dur="3.231">show</text>
  <text start="295.729" dur="4.261">and Hannity had pressed him about this</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="4.259">issue and then trey gowdy was more or</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="4.019">less aying well you know there might be</text>
  <text start="302.029" dur="4.081">other consequences maybe you might lose</text>
  <text start="304.009" dur="4.861">your license and things like that so he</text>
  <text start="306.11" dur="5.399">was really kind of backing off of the</text>
  <text start="308.87" dur="4.789">idea of prison time for these folks so</text>
  <text start="311.509" dur="4.74">let&amp;#39;s take a listen to what he said</text>
  <text start="313.659" dur="4.48">tonight&amp;#39;s big breaking news that the</text>
  <text start="316.249" dur="4.53">Inspector General horowitz has submitted</text>
  <text start="318.139" dur="5.28">his Pfizer report for classification</text>
  <text start="320.779" dur="4.5">review to the DOJ Fox News contributor</text>
  <text start="323.419" dur="5.131">former Republican congressman trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="325.279" dur="8.22">you first said and I&amp;#39;ll get to this in a</text>
  <text start="328.55" dur="7.799">second that the idea that now mccabe</text>
  <text start="333.499" dur="5.04">they passed on any oh special treatment</text>
  <text start="336.349" dur="4.5">but it was a while ago that report</text>
  <text start="338.539" dur="4.8">identified the Inspector General report</text>
  <text start="340.849" dur="4.8">identified him as a liar and a leaker</text>
  <text start="343.339" dur="4.41">and you said it&amp;#39;s a celebration of our</text>
  <text start="345.649" dur="4.8">justice system now we had the second</text>
  <text start="347.749" dur="6.03">minor report that was call me lacking</text>
  <text start="350.449" dur="5.131">candor but that didn&amp;#39;t result in well it</text>
  <text start="353.779" dur="3.991">did result in a referral but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="355.58" dur="3.72">seem like they&amp;#39;re moving forward why is</text>
  <text start="357.77" dur="3.54">this taking so long</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="3.329">and we&amp;#39;ll get to FISA neck because I</text>
  <text start="361.31" dur="4.919">have some concerns about what the</text>
  <text start="362.629" dur="6.81">outcome will be you know Sean there was</text>
  <text start="366.229" dur="5.67">a trial in DC what last week and former</text>
  <text start="369.439" dur="4.59">White House Counsel Greg Craig was found</text>
  <text start="371.899" dur="5.31">not guilty and what was a really quick</text>
  <text start="374.029" dur="5.581">jury verdict these are tough cases it is</text>
  <text start="377.209" dur="4.74">harder than it might appear to convince</text>
  <text start="379.61" dur="4.289">12 people of anything I used to have to</text>
  <text start="381.949" dur="4.321">do it for a living it&amp;#39;s tough so you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="383.899" dur="5.13">got a dot every I and cross every T and</text>
  <text start="386.27" dur="6.09">quite candidly it is more difficult if</text>
  <text start="389.029" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s a high-profile defendant so if they</text>
  <text start="392.36" dur="5.369">go forward with McCabe you can rest</text>
  <text start="395.209" dur="4.08">assured that&amp;#39;s going to be a tough trial</text>
  <text start="397.729" dur="4.44">we don&amp;#39;t want the United States</text>
  <text start="399.289" dur="5.041">government going to trial and losing on</text>
  <text start="402.169" dur="4.23">a regular basis they lost the Greg Craig</text>
  <text start="404.33" dur="5.369">that&amp;#39;s not good so if you&amp;#39;re going to go</text>
  <text start="406.399" dur="5.19">to the trial you need to win you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="409.699" dur="3.69">never lost the case as a prosecutor</text>
  <text start="411.589" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s why you know you&amp;#39;re so good at</text>
  <text start="413.389" dur="5.25">what you do here&amp;#39;s my question so we now</text>
  <text start="416.599" dur="4.05">know I can give you as the relates to</text>
  <text start="418.639" dur="5.58">FISA and the FISA inspector general</text>
  <text start="420.649" dur="5.61">report we I know of three separate times</text>
  <text start="424.219" dur="4.62">including by the way the UK memo warning</text>
  <text start="426.259" dur="3.27">warning about steals credibility but we</text>
  <text start="428.839" dur="2.67">know three</text>
  <text start="429.529" dur="3.96">spurred instances before the first FISA</text>
  <text start="431.509" dur="4.26">application was signed the bulk of</text>
  <text start="433.489" dur="5.16">information we now know was the</text>
  <text start="435.769" dur="4.56">unverified dirty Russian dossier likely</text>
  <text start="438.649" dur="4.14">Russian disinformation according to the</text>
  <text start="440.329" dur="4.5">New York Times from the get-go but they</text>
  <text start="442.789" dur="4.62">were warned about Steele&amp;#39;s credibility</text>
  <text start="444.829" dur="5.19">before they signed the first FISA they</text>
  <text start="447.409" dur="4.08">were warned by Bruce Doran the UK was</text>
  <text start="450.019" dur="2.7">warning about his credibility that</text>
  <text start="451.489" dur="3.69">Steele had an agenda</text>
  <text start="452.719" dur="3.51">it wasn&amp;#39;t verified and Hillary paid for</text>
  <text start="455.179" dur="3.09">it now</text>
  <text start="456.229" dur="4.44">they used it anyway now we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.269" dur="4.65">unverifiable because field never stood</text>
  <text start="460.669" dur="4.83">by his own dossier and under oath said I</text>
  <text start="462.919" dur="5.91">have no idea of any of its true now to</text>
  <text start="465.499" dur="5.1">me that seems like premeditated fraud on</text>
  <text start="468.829" dur="3.6">a FISA Court and when you couple that</text>
  <text start="470.599" dur="3.99">with Andrew McCabe the deputy at-bat</text>
  <text start="472.429" dur="4.86">director saying well no dossier no FISA</text>
  <text start="474.589" dur="4.47">warrant that makes me think they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="477.289" dur="4.35">care about what they were presenting to</text>
  <text start="479.059" dur="4.74">the court and that was a fraud and they</text>
  <text start="481.639" dur="6.9">knew was a fraud but they said it was</text>
  <text start="483.799" dur="6.57">verified and it wasn&amp;#39;t let&amp;#39;s assume for</text>
  <text start="488.539" dur="6.15">the sake of argument that everything you</text>
  <text start="490.369" dur="7.35">said was true let&amp;#39;s do that you still</text>
  <text start="494.689" dur="5.1">have to find a criminal statute if your</text>
  <text start="497.719" dur="4.38">objective is indictment which is why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="499.789" dur="4.5">really clear every time y&amp;#39;all are good</text>
  <text start="502.099" dur="4.98">enough to have me on we cannot live in a</text>
  <text start="504.289" dur="5.19">society where indictment is the only</text>
  <text start="507.079" dur="4.77">thing that carries with it any stigma I</text>
  <text start="509.479" dur="4.86">mean most of the names involved with the</text>
  <text start="511.849" dur="5.13">FISA approval process in 2016 if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.339" dur="4.62">been fired or they&amp;#39;ve been publicly</text>
  <text start="516.979" dur="4.08">called to task keep in mind Jim Comey</text>
  <text start="518.959" dur="5.01">twice now the Inspector General had said</text>
  <text start="521.059" dur="5.311">you did not meet our expectations but</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="4.41">you failed to follow policy you violated</text>
  <text start="526.37" dur="5.1">your employment agreement all of that</text>
  <text start="528.379" dur="4.77">has to be significant look I used to</text>
  <text start="531.47" dur="3.599">make representations in front of a court</text>
  <text start="533.149" dur="3.901">and I tried really hard to be honest and</text>
  <text start="535.069" dur="4.171">fair about that but let&amp;#39;s assume that I</text>
  <text start="537.05" dur="3.99">didn&amp;#39;t tell the court something the</text>
  <text start="539.24" dur="3.899">remedy for me is not indictment the</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="3.81">remedy is I may lose my law license let</text>
  <text start="543.139" dur="4.711">me put it in a way that may all be in</text>
  <text start="544.85" dur="5.399">contempt here&amp;#39;s the thing if I am warned</text>
  <text start="547.85" dur="5.76">that something that I&amp;#39;m about to present</text>
  <text start="550.249" dur="5.041">in court is false and at the top of an</text>
  <text start="553.61" dur="4.319">application I&amp;#39;m making to the court it</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="5.25">says verified and I test that I sign it</text>
  <text start="557.929" dur="4.5">say that it&amp;#39;s verified but I was warned</text>
  <text start="560.54" dur="2.61">that it isn&amp;#39;t and I don&amp;#39;t do the job of</text>
  <text start="562.429" dur="2.731">verify</text>
  <text start="563.15" dur="4.14">because it&amp;#39;s unverifiable we know now</text>
  <text start="565.16" dur="4.35">when the FBI finally got into you know</text>
  <text start="567.29" dur="4.17">their spreadsheet they discovered 90</text>
  <text start="569.51" dur="3.54">plus percent of not all of the dirty</text>
  <text start="571.46" dur="5.13">dossier was untrue</text>
  <text start="573.05" dur="7.23">so that was later though so if I&amp;#39;m if I</text>
  <text start="576.59" dur="5.73">know if I know it&amp;#39;s not verified and I</text>
  <text start="580.28" dur="5.01">present it as verified and its</text>
  <text start="582.32" dur="5.49">unverifiable that would seem like Sean</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="5.94">Hannity went to the court and committed</text>
  <text start="587.81" dur="5.19">a fraud on the court consciously for the</text>
  <text start="591.23" dur="4.05">purpose of achieving a political agenda</text>
  <text start="593" dur="4.11">why do I think Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s great an</text>
  <text start="595.28" dur="6.15">attorney as you are never lost the case</text>
  <text start="597.11" dur="7.2">as a prosecutor that I&amp;#39;d go to jail well</text>
  <text start="601.43" dur="4.59">it depends if you&amp;#39;re a lawyer you would</text>
  <text start="604.31" dur="2.91">lose your law license and the court can</text>
  <text start="606.02" dur="3.48">hold you in contempt</text>
  <text start="607.22" dur="6.33">remember David and I wrote the final I</text>
  <text start="609.5" dur="6.84">before a judge we thought about lying</text>
  <text start="613.55" dur="7.05">before a judge you&amp;#39;ll be hella why be</text>
  <text start="616.34" dur="7.11">held in contempt of court that&amp;#39;s so I</text>
  <text start="620.6" dur="4.47">agree with what daddy was saying in the</text>
  <text start="623.45" dur="3.54">beginning when he was responding to why</text>
  <text start="625.07" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s taking so long because it has been</text>
  <text start="626.99" dur="3.96">taking a long time and I know people are</text>
  <text start="629.09" dur="3.84">getting a little bit impatient at how</text>
  <text start="630.95" dur="3.66">long it&amp;#39;s taking but what they haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="632.93" dur="5.1">understand is exactly what he was saying</text>
  <text start="634.61" dur="6.24">is that we have to cross all the T&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="638.03" dur="4.35">dot all the i&amp;#39;s if we want to catch the</text>
  <text start="640.85" dur="3.72">bad guy in this case especially when the</text>
  <text start="642.38" dur="4.65">bad guy is a very high-profile</text>
  <text start="644.57" dur="4.26">individual and the reason for that is is</text>
  <text start="647.03" dur="4.83">because these high-profile individuals</text>
  <text start="648.83" dur="9.03">these high status powerful people they</text>

  <text start="657.86" dur="4.08">of county accountability at their</text>
  <text start="660.17" dur="3.57">disposal and that&amp;#39;s why you see a lot of</text>
  <text start="661.94" dur="4.41">these people who are very powerful they</text>
  <text start="663.74" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t serve that amount of time that</text>
  <text start="666.35" dur="5.16">they should be serving for certain cases</text>
  <text start="668.24" dur="5.09">for example Jeffrey Epstein also a lot</text>
  <text start="671.51" dur="7.16">of times they&amp;#39;re not found guilty of</text>
  <text start="673.33" dur="7.99">crimes that they definitely committed</text>
  <text start="678.67" dur="5.32">because they were able to pay a lawyer</text>
  <text start="681.32" dur="4.53">long enough in order to dig up one iota</text>
  <text start="683.99" dur="3.81">of doubt</text>
  <text start="685.85" dur="5.18">that they could use in court to get out</text>
  <text start="687.8" dur="6.93">of it to be acquitted</text>
  <text start="691.03" dur="10.02">for example the glove does not fit you</text>
  <text start="694.73" dur="12.96">must acquit right so I agree with that</text>
  <text start="701.05" dur="9.67">but then he started really implying that</text>
  <text start="707.69" dur="4.77">when it comes to McCabe and Kony and all</text>
  <text start="710.72" dur="7.17">of these folks who were involved in this</text>
  <text start="712.46" dur="11.55">whole FISA abuse scandal this Spygate</text>
  <text start="717.89" dur="10.08">scandal all of those folks may not</text>
  <text start="724.01" dur="7.17">really be eligible for prison time that</text>
  <text start="727.97" dur="8.4">oh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s likely enough that they</text>
  <text start="731.18" dur="7.86">were fired no it&amp;#39;s not it is not okay it</text>
  <text start="736.37" dur="6.12">is not enough for these people to be</text>
  <text start="739.04" dur="5.46">fired from their jobs what they did was</text>
  <text start="742.49" dur="5.94">a crime and everything that Sean Hannity</text>
  <text start="744.5" dur="6.35">just said and he talked about all the</text>
  <text start="748.43" dur="4.59">different things all of these items that</text>
  <text start="750.85" dur="5.65">demonstrate that this was a coup</text>
  <text start="753.02" dur="6.06">including this steel dossier that was</text>
  <text start="756.5" dur="4.74">unverifiable not that it was unverified</text>
  <text start="759.08" dur="4.47">it was unverifiable because the whole</text>
  <text start="761.24" dur="5.61">thing was fake it was made up even even</text>
  <text start="763.55" dur="6.75">Christopher steel admitted to that it</text>
  <text start="766.85" dur="9.75">was paid for by the DNC and the Hillary</text>
  <text start="770.3" dur="9.09">campaign for the purposes of preventing</text>
  <text start="776.6" dur="6.66">President Trump from well then candidate</text>
  <text start="779.39" dur="6.06">Trump from being elected and then when</text>
  <text start="783.26" dur="5.09">he was elected they used it as a weapon</text>
  <text start="785.45" dur="7.29">in order to try to get him out an</text>
  <text start="788.35" dur="6.61">attempted coup that&amp;#39;s treason in my book</text>
  <text start="792.74" dur="3.84">and correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="794.96" dur="5.25">pretty sure that treason is a very</text>
  <text start="796.58" dur="7.38">serious crime and very serious crimes</text>
  <text start="800.21" dur="7.17">deserved very serious consequences if</text>
  <text start="803.96" dur="5.88">you commit treason it is not enough for</text>
  <text start="807.38" dur="4.27">you it is not enough for you to lose</text>
  <text start="809.84" dur="5.2">your job</text>
  <text start="811.65" dur="10.17">oh you committed treason is okay</text>
  <text start="815.04" dur="14.36">you&amp;#39;re fired no no you go to prison for</text>
  <text start="821.82" dur="7.58">a long time that is not equal justice</text>
  <text start="829.64" dur="6.34">treason deserves a very serious</text>
  <text start="832.74" dur="5.099">consequence and trey gowdy I am very</text>
  <text start="835.98" dur="4.08">disappointed that you would even come on</text>
  <text start="837.839" dur="8.341">television and even make statements as</text>
  <text start="840.06" dur="10.219">ridiculous as that and certainly it</text>
  <text start="846.18" dur="12.3">makes me a little bit suspicious about</text>
  <text start="850.279" dur="10.141">your motives I don&amp;#39;t know it seems</text>
  <text start="858.48" dur="5.52">rather strange to me that trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="860.42" dur="5.74">would say something like this because it</text>
  <text start="864" dur="5.37">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense alright enough</text>
  <text start="866.16" dur="5.07">about that so hopefully we will see</text>
  <text start="869.37" dur="3.84">prison time for these folks I know</text>
  <text start="871.23" dur="3.69">McCarthy certainly thinks that that is</text>
  <text start="873.21" dur="3.45">going to be the case I think that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.92" dur="4.47">going to be the case so we&amp;#39;ll see what</text>
  <text start="876.66" dur="5.22">happens when Durham and his team wrap up</text>
  <text start="879.39" dur="4.38">this case so we should be seeing</text>
  <text start="881.88" dur="6.18">something I would think probably within</text>
  <text start="883.77" dur="5.9">the next month or so hopefully so I will</text>
  <text start="888.06" dur="5.34">be giving updates on that</text>
  <text start="889.67" dur="6.73">okay in other news Brett Kavanaugh</text>
  <text start="893.4" dur="6.36">justice Cavanaugh is back in the news</text>
  <text start="896.4" dur="6.21">cycle once again somewhere around the</text>
  <text start="899.76" dur="4.74">one-year anniversary of his confirmation</text>
  <text start="902.61" dur="4.979">hearings and of course that was a whole</text>
  <text start="904.5" dur="8.43">fiasco where people were just coming in</text>
  <text start="907.589" dur="8.791">and just saying anything really they</text>
  <text start="912.93" dur="6.9">tried to smear him so hard because they</text>
  <text start="916.38" dur="6.06">did not want him to be on the Supreme</text>
  <text start="919.83" dur="6.24">Court and recently has actually come out</text>
  <text start="922.44" dur="5.88">that Christine Blasi Ford&amp;#39;s lawyer she</text>
  <text start="926.07" dur="5.34">had admitted to the fact that they their</text>
  <text start="928.32" dur="7.83">motive was to protect roe versus wade</text>
  <text start="931.41" dur="8.429">and because he&amp;#39;s a conservative justice</text>
  <text start="936.15" dur="6.48">than if he is on the Supreme Court then</text>
  <text start="939.839" dur="4.801">that means there are more conservative</text>
  <text start="942.63" dur="6.18">justices than liberal</text>
  <text start="944.64" dur="9.18">and so then Roe versus Wade is in danger</text>
  <text start="948.81" dur="6.42">of being turned over so that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="953.82" dur="2.94">wanted to keep him out so bad and they</text>
  <text start="955.23" dur="3.3">were willing to destroy him and his</text>
  <text start="956.76" dur="5.31">family in order to keep him out as</text>
  <text start="958.53" dur="5.87">dangerous so now they supposedly have</text>
  <text start="962.07" dur="7.41">these new allegations that have come out</text>
  <text start="964.4" dur="7.33">where someone says that they saw him at</text>
  <text start="969.48" dur="4.56">a party once now this whole story</text>
  <text start="971.73" dur="3.87">doesn&amp;#39;t add up to me if you picture it</text>
  <text start="974.04" dur="3.39">in your mind and I try not to actually</text>
  <text start="975.6" dur="4.02">especially when it comes to things like</text>
  <text start="977.43" dur="3.93">this but I&amp;#39;m a very visual person so a</text>
  <text start="979.62" dur="4.38">lot of times when I&amp;#39;m reading something</text>
  <text start="981.36" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll have a a picture in my</text>
  <text start="984" dur="3.18">mind of what it looks like</text>
  <text start="985.11" dur="4.47">not that I want to in this case but</text>
  <text start="987.18" dur="6.48">anyway so saying too much all right so</text>
  <text start="989.58" dur="7.14">in this case they&amp;#39;re saying that justice</text>
  <text start="993.66" dur="6.63">Cavanaugh had his pants down and then</text>
  <text start="996.72" dur="8.97">his friends had pushed his penis into</text>
  <text start="1000.29" dur="8.28">the hands of a girl how does that even</text>
  <text start="1005.69" dur="5.21">work that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="1008.57" dur="4.56">whatsoever</text>
  <text start="1010.9" dur="5.74">it seems like it would be a very awkward</text>
  <text start="1013.13" dur="7.44">situation like how how would that even</text>
  <text start="1016.64" dur="7.32">happen that makes that whole story makes</text>
  <text start="1020.57" dur="7.019">no sense oh and also by the way the</text>
  <text start="1023.96" dur="6.45">person who is saying this is a guy who</text>
  <text start="1027.589" dur="6.031">is the head of some research</text>
  <text start="1030.41" dur="10.38">philanthropy group no surprise there</text>
  <text start="1033.62" dur="8.76">right so now he&amp;#39;s saying this a year</text>
  <text start="1040.79" dur="2.88">after the confirmation hearing when</text>
  <text start="1042.38" dur="3.42">everybody else was coming out with the</text>
  <text start="1043.67" dur="4.02">stories why you couldn&amp;#39;t come out back</text>
  <text start="1045.8" dur="7.08">then you&amp;#39;re just now all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1047.69" dur="8.43">remembering this now now in addition to</text>
  <text start="1052.88" dur="5.07">that one then we have another lady who</text>
  <text start="1056.12" dur="5.25">had has come out and she said that she</text>
  <text start="1057.95" dur="5.22">was also sexually assaulted at a party</text>
  <text start="1061.37" dur="3.87">but she can&amp;#39;t really remember parts of</text>
  <text start="1063.17" dur="6.33">it because she was drunk and it was a</text>
  <text start="1065.24" dur="5.34">long time ago now the interesting thing</text>
  <text start="1069.5" dur="4.35">about this story is that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1070.58" dur="7.17">recycling it now even though her story</text>
  <text start="1073.85" dur="7.99">was already debunked a year ago</text>
  <text start="1077.75" dur="8.02">the FBI had already said that her story</text>
  <text start="1081.84" dur="6.12">had no credibility whatsoever but yet</text>
  <text start="1085.77" dur="4.88">the media is pushing this one through</text>
  <text start="1087.96" dur="2.69">the cycle now too</text>
  <text start="1091.97" dur="8.79">now also we have senator Kamala Harris</text>
  <text start="1098.309" dur="5.641">and she is leading the pack right now</text>
  <text start="1100.76" dur="5.49">attacking justice Cavanaugh claiming</text>

  <text start="1110.85" dur="5.04">justice Cavanaugh that he should be</text>
  <text start="1112.86" dur="5.04">impeached now I&amp;#39;ll tell you in a minute</text>
  <text start="1115.89" dur="3.69">about why this is so interesting and why</text>
  <text start="1117.9" dur="4.11">it does not surprise me that Kamala</text>
  <text start="1119.58" dur="6.06">Harris would be leading the pack on this</text>
  <text start="1122.01" dur="5.43">so I will tell you about that in a</text>
  <text start="1125.64" dur="3.51">minute but anyway let&amp;#39;s go over some of</text>
  <text start="1127.44" dur="3.9">the things that they&amp;#39;re saying so Kamala</text>
  <text start="1129.15" dur="3.96">Harris had tweeted this out she says I</text>

  <text start="1459.67" dur="3.59">your ak-47</text>
  <text start="1466.45" dur="13.14">so he&amp;#39;s trying to make the claim that</text>
  <text start="1472.36" dur="11.319">this applies to ar-15s and ak-47s</text>
  <text start="1479.59" dur="6.79">exclusively almost but in his own</text>
  <text start="1483.679" dur="8.97">statement what he&amp;#39;s describing really is</text>
  <text start="1486.38" dur="12.06">any gun so he says any weapon designed</text>
  <text start="1492.649" dur="9.301">to kill people if you shoot someone with</text>
  <text start="1498.44" dur="5.219">a gun any gun you are maybe going to</text>
  <text start="1501.95" dur="4.49">kill that person especially if you hit</text>
  <text start="1503.659" dur="2.781">them in the right place</text>
  <text start="1507.639" dur="6.04">that&amp;#39;s what bullets do even if you get</text>
  <text start="1511.82" dur="5.88">shot with one bullet if you get it a</text>
  <text start="1513.679" dur="10.11">bullet to the heart to the head to the</text>
  <text start="1517.7" dur="9.9">gut you will be dead this is a fact and</text>
  <text start="1523.789" dur="7.171">then he&amp;#39;s describing the bullet going</text>
  <text start="1527.6" dur="7.11">through the body and he&amp;#39;s trying to make</text>
  <text start="1530.96" dur="6.63">it seem like this is exclusive to a k47</text>
  <text start="1534.71" dur="6.39">to ar-15s and he says as the bullet</text>
  <text start="1537.59" dur="7.829">shreds through your body and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1541.1" dur="11.569">a bullet does when a bullet enters your</text>

  <text start="1555.529" dur="12.961">the other side I mean what specifically</text>
  <text start="1564.5" dur="6.12">about an ak-47 or an ar-15</text>
  <text start="1568.49" dur="9.779">what makes this bullets different than</text>
  <text start="1570.62" dur="10.009">any other bullet really because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1578.269" dur="7.11">going to do the same thing they are all</text>
  <text start="1580.629" dur="13.02">designed to kill if you shoot someone in</text>
  <text start="1585.379" dur="8.27">the right place that is a fact</text>
  <text start="1594.72" dur="5.98">so your definition how you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1598.24" dur="6.36">describe the damage that these weapons</text>
  <text start="1600.7" dur="15.18">cause you&amp;#39;re really just describing any</text>
  <text start="1604.6" dur="12.69">weapon any gun and then if you really</text>
  <text start="1615.88" dur="3.51">just stop at the statement where you</text>
  <text start="1617.29" dur="5.16">said any weapon designed to kill people</text>
  <text start="1619.39" dur="6.3">well a lot of things can be used to kill</text>
  <text start="1622.45" dur="4.5">people cars can kill people knives can</text>
  <text start="1625.69" dur="6.93">kill people they just had a mass</text>
  <text start="1626.95" dur="7.91">stabbing are you going to ban knives are</text>
  <text start="1632.62" dur="11.46">you going to confiscate knives</text>
  <text start="1634.86" dur="10.72">compensate confiscate cars by using the</text>
  <text start="1644.08" dur="4.53">language that you are using in that</text>
  <text start="1645.58" dur="8.49">debate you&amp;#39;re really just trying to</text>
  <text start="1648.61" dur="8.16">appeal to people&amp;#39;s emotions trying to</text>
  <text start="1654.07" dur="4.95">get the public fired up about getting</text>
  <text start="1656.77" dur="4.56">rid of the guns because that is going to</text>
  <text start="1659.02" dur="4.23">solve our mass shooting problem that is</text>
  <text start="1661.33" dur="7.35">not going to solve the mass shooting</text>
  <text start="1663.25" dur="7.95">problem and also when you say make the</text>
  <text start="1668.68" dur="4.65">claim that you&amp;#39;ve talked to gun owners</text>
  <text start="1671.2" dur="4.2">at gun shows and and they&amp;#39;ve told you</text>
  <text start="1673.33" dur="5.22">that they would rather turn over their</text>
  <text start="1675.4" dur="5.25">guns to you because it&amp;#39;s safer that</text>
  <text start="1678.55" dur="4.95">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense if you were a</text>
  <text start="1680.65" dur="10.07">law-abiding citizen your weapon is not</text>
  <text start="1683.5" dur="7.22">dangerous in your hands it&amp;#39;s just not</text>
  <text start="1692.22" dur="7.33">it&amp;#39;s like that guy who handed over he</text>
  <text start="1696.34" dur="6.42">turned in his weapon because he said it</text>
  <text start="1699.55" dur="5.7">was too dangerous to own you&amp;#39;re the one</text>
  <text start="1702.76" dur="4.86">who owns that weapon that weapon will</text>
  <text start="1705.25" dur="9.21">not do anything without you pulling the</text>
  <text start="1707.62" dur="9.63">trigger there&amp;#39;s nothing dangerous about</text>
  <text start="1714.46" dur="5.22">a weapon that is owned by a law-abiding</text>
  <text start="1717.25" dur="4.32">citizen that weapon owned by a</text>
  <text start="1719.68" dur="4.67">law-abiding citizen is not going to be</text>
  <text start="1721.57" dur="2.78">used in a mass shooting</text>
  <text start="1724.95" dur="13.11">really now also baito has now claimed</text>
  <text start="1733" dur="8.52">that his gun confiscation plan it is</text>
  <text start="1738.06" dur="8.14">constitutionally sound this is what he</text>
  <text start="1741.52" dur="6.9">claims through the Commerce Clause so</text>
  <text start="1746.2" dur="5.76">this is what he had to say about that he</text>
  <text start="1748.42" dur="7.26">says quotes let&amp;#39;s see let me see if I</text>
  <text start="1751.96" dur="6.36">could find it again okay here is he says</text>
  <text start="1755.68" dur="4.5">quote this is something that we&amp;#39;re able</text>
  <text start="1758.32" dur="3.48">to do through the Commerce Clause and</text>
  <text start="1760.18" dur="3.66">this is something that is not prevented</text>
  <text start="1761.8" dur="3.81">from wouldn&amp;#39;t prevent the United States</text>
  <text start="1763.84" dur="5.27">from doing by the Second Amendment so</text>
  <text start="1765.61" dur="6.18">this is constitutionally sound this is</text>
  <text start="1769.11" dur="8.02">absolutely necessary if we care about</text>
  <text start="1771.79" dur="11.52">the lives of our fellow Americans what</text>
  <text start="1777.13" dur="9.57">are you talking about do you know what</text>
  <text start="1783.31" dur="7.08">the Commerce Clause is so the Commerce</text>
  <text start="1786.7" dur="5.67">Clause states that the United States</text>
  <text start="1790.39" dur="3.6">Congress shall have power quote to</text>
  <text start="1792.37" dur="4.17">regulate commerce with foreign nations</text>
  <text start="1793.99" dur="5.45">and among the several states and with</text>
  <text start="1796.54" dur="7.38">the Indian tribes end quote</text>
  <text start="1799.44" dur="8.41">and it is also not supposed to affect</text>
  <text start="1803.92" dur="8.07">private property so how on earth X</text>
  <text start="1807.85" dur="5.94">please explain this to us explain how</text>
  <text start="1811.99" dur="7.52">you are going to use the Commerce Clause</text>
  <text start="1813.79" dur="5.72">to confiscate guns private property</text>
  <text start="1821.85" dur="8.77">Commerce has to do with sales the</text>
  <text start="1827.35" dur="5.52">regulation of sales if a gun is already</text>
  <text start="1830.62" dur="4.8">owned by someone how are you going to</text>
  <text start="1832.87" dur="7.37">use the Commerce Clause in order to take</text>
  <text start="1835.42" dur="9.77">that gun it is unconstitutional and</text>
  <text start="1840.24" dur="7.63">really anything that infringes on a</text>
  <text start="1845.19" dur="4.77">person&amp;#39;s second Amendment rights their</text>
  <text start="1847.87" dur="4.7">right to own a gun</text>
  <text start="1849.96" dur="5.789">is not constitutionally sound because</text>
  <text start="1852.57" dur="6.39">the Second Amendment states that it</text>
  <text start="1855.749" dur="8.581">shall not be infringed shall not be</text>
  <text start="1858.96" dur="10.049">infringed and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that gun</text>
  <text start="1864.33" dur="9.679">confiscation is really a lot more than</text>
  <text start="1869.009" dur="11.221">just infringing on you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1874.009" dur="7.571">taking away someone&amp;#39;s gun by force by</text>
  <text start="1880.23" dur="4.529">your own admission because you were</text>
  <text start="1881.58" dur="6.479">asked about this and what you would do</text>
  <text start="1884.759" dur="4.8">in the case that a person who owns a gun</text>
  <text start="1888.059" dur="3.84">does not turn in their weapon and then</text>
  <text start="1889.559" dur="4.771">you had said that you would utilize law</text>
  <text start="1891.899" dur="4.801">enforcement so you&amp;#39;re gonna send guys</text>
  <text start="1894.33" dur="3.87">with guns to the door of every single</text>
  <text start="1896.7" dur="3.39">person that does not turn in their gun</text>
  <text start="1898.2" dur="7.679">and you&amp;#39;re going to force them to turn</text>
  <text start="1900.09" dur="10.669">in their gun but luckily for us you bet</text>
  <text start="1905.879" dur="4.88">- or work will not ever be president</text>
  <text start="1911.84" dur="11.559">you&amp;#39;re just not so and it&amp;#39;s a good thing</text>
  <text start="1915.09" dur="12.059">- because you cannot take our guns all</text>
  <text start="1923.399" dur="6.74">right so a little homework for you go</text>
  <text start="1927.149" dur="6.51">home and review the Constitution also</text>
  <text start="1930.139" dur="8.341">you should really focus on the Second</text>
  <text start="1933.659" dur="8.51">Amendment and also the Commerce Clause</text>
  <text start="1938.48" dur="3.689">that is your homework</text>
  <text start="1942.95" dur="5.49">okay so now for the big story of the day</text>
  <text start="1945.799" dur="5.161">this is one I&amp;#39;ve been covering for a few</text>
  <text start="1948.44" dur="4.739">days now I had actually just learned</text>
  <text start="1950.96" dur="4.319">about this a few days ago so I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1953.179" dur="4.171">really focusing on this and covering it</text>
  <text start="1955.279" dur="5.28">because it deserves the coverage now</text>
  <text start="1957.35" dur="5.069">this is a story that&amp;#39;s not really in the</text>
  <text start="1960.559" dur="4.2">mainstream media and in fact it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="1962.419" dur="5.97">not really uh naltar &amp;#39;native media I</text>
  <text start="1964.759" dur="6.091">actually had to find this story on sites</text>
  <text start="1968.389" dur="5.581">that I don&amp;#39;t normally look to for</text>
  <text start="1970.85" dur="5.909">stories so this is something that is</text>
  <text start="1973.97" dur="4.409">really under the radar but it&amp;#39;s huge</text>
  <text start="1976.759" dur="4.26">and there&amp;#39;s a few different reasons why</text>
  <text start="1978.379" dur="5.311">but the basic overview of the story for</text>
  <text start="1981.019" dur="4.26">those of you who may not have seen my</text>
  <text start="1983.69" dur="3.059">other videos maybe you&amp;#39;re hearing about</text>
  <text start="1985.279" dur="4.77">this for the first time I&amp;#39;ll just give a</text>
  <text start="1986.749" dur="6.27">brief overview but two investigative</text>
  <text start="1990.049" dur="5.69">journalists let me see if I can find</text>
  <text start="1993.019" dur="6.99">bring up their names really quick here</text>
  <text start="1995.739" dur="6.82">David daleiden and Sandra Mary&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="2000.009" dur="6.78">these two investigative journalists they</text>
  <text start="2002.559" dur="7.771">are currently facing 15 felony charges</text>
  <text start="2006.789" dur="7.681">for violation of privacy because they</text>
  <text start="2010.33" dur="5.699">had went undercover in order to expose</text>
  <text start="2014.47" dur="6.539">Planned Parenthood and other abortion</text>
  <text start="2016.029" dur="7.98">industry agencies crimes now I want to</text>
  <text start="2021.009" dur="4.561">make a quick correction here I always</text>
  <text start="2024.009" dur="3.811">want to correct if I find that I made a</text>
  <text start="2025.57" dur="4.079">mistake and also for those of you</text>
  <text start="2027.82" dur="3.87">listening out there if you catch me in a</text>
  <text start="2029.649" dur="3.421">mistake please let me know so then I can</text>
  <text start="2031.69" dur="3.329">correct it because I&amp;#39;m not always right</text>
  <text start="2033.07" dur="6.15">you know sometimes I do make mistakes so</text>
  <text start="2035.019" dur="8.73">in this case when I first heard about</text>
  <text start="2039.22" dur="6.809">this story I had said that these</text>
  <text start="2043.749" dur="4.64">investigative journalists had worked for</text>
  <text start="2046.029" dur="6.84">several months undercover maybe a year</text>
  <text start="2048.389" dur="8.341">to expose Planned Parenthood actually</text>
  <text start="2052.869" dur="7.5">they went undercover for three years</text>
  <text start="2056.73" dur="7.569">they went to great lengths to expose</text>
  <text start="2060.369" dur="10.5">Planned Parenthood so the result of that</text>
  <text start="2064.299" dur="10.651">is that they were able to obtain a slew</text>
  <text start="2070.869" dur="6.151">of evidence of crimes over 15 videos now</text>
  <text start="2074.95" dur="4.35">actually there are more videos but</text>
  <text start="2077.02" dur="5.369">the ones that have been made public so</text>
  <text start="2079.3" dur="6.99">far are there are 15 of them which is</text>
  <text start="2082.389" dur="6.901">why they&amp;#39;re facing 15 felony charges now</text>
  <text start="2086.29" dur="7.29">the way that they did that was they</text>
  <text start="2089.29" dur="6.45">created a false company a false fetal</text>
  <text start="2093.58" dur="4.65">tissue procurement company by the name</text>
  <text start="2095.74" dur="4.32">of bio max they created this so that</text>
  <text start="2098.23" dur="3.87">that way they could get into these</text>
  <text start="2100.06" dur="4.41">different conventions they could meet</text>
  <text start="2102.1" dur="4.65">with various CEOs medical directors and</text>
  <text start="2104.47" dur="6.48">all of that they needed to be able to</text>
  <text start="2106.75" dur="7.95">get this information so they posed as</text>
  <text start="2110.95" dur="7.95">the enemy in order to do this they posed</text>
  <text start="2114.7" dur="10.2">as potential customers potential buyers</text>
  <text start="2118.9" dur="8.31">of fetal tissue and the information that</text>
  <text start="2124.9" dur="5.1">they gathered from from doing this is</text>
  <text start="2127.21" dur="5.13">astounding and I&amp;#39;ve actually seen the</text>
  <text start="2130" dur="4.38">videos I&amp;#39;ll have to dig them up and</text>
  <text start="2132.34" dur="4.29">probably in the next video that I make</text>
  <text start="2134.38" dur="5.34">the next report that I do on this I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2136.63" dur="6.06">post that I know I posted it on the very</text>
  <text start="2139.72" dur="4.95">first video that I did where I included</text>
  <text start="2142.69" dur="6.81">this so I&amp;#39;ll have to go back and look</text>
  <text start="2144.67" dur="10.67">for that but anyway I&amp;#39;ve seen some of</text>
  <text start="2149.5" dur="12.359">these videos and really it is appalling</text>
  <text start="2155.34" dur="9.519">what they are doing now the problem is</text>
  <text start="2161.859" dur="5.341">is that right now they&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="2164.859" dur="5.191">preliminary hearing and throughout this</text>
  <text start="2167.2" dur="5.22">preliminary hearing they have gotten</text>
  <text start="2170.05" dur="4.44">these people who they&amp;#39;re not naming</text>
  <text start="2172.42" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re trying to make sure that they</text>
  <text start="2174.49" dur="4.89">protect these individuals finding naming</text>
  <text start="2177.52" dur="3.99">them doe number one Dona Moore to</text>
  <text start="2179.38" dur="6.47">whoever but these are people who work</text>

  <text start="2193.57" dur="8.22">hearing they have admitted to doing</text>
  <text start="2198.22" dur="5.91">these things in fact in one of these</text>
  <text start="2201.79" dur="6.02">preliminary hearings they had even</text>
  <text start="2204.13" dur="3.68">admitted to selling</text>
  <text start="2208.79" dur="11.55">hearts that are still beating things</text>
  <text start="2212.31" dur="10.76">like that like live hearts this is</text>
  <text start="2220.34" dur="5.92">disturbing</text>
  <text start="2223.07" dur="6.45">so in the case of the live hearts for</text>
  <text start="2226.26" dur="5.43">example they would use the heart for</text>
  <text start="2229.52" dur="10.42">experimentation that is really designed</text>
  <text start="2231.69" dur="11.79">for non human experiments now another</text>
  <text start="2239.94" dur="7.23">example is that they would change the</text>
  <text start="2243.48" dur="5.76">position of the fetus in order to ensure</text>
  <text start="2247.17" dur="3.81">that they get the most intact specimen</text>
  <text start="2249.24" dur="4.02">because they can get more money for it</text>
  <text start="2250.98" dur="5.31">and they admitted this in their videos</text>
  <text start="2253.26" dur="6.54">as well as during the hearing so this is</text>
  <text start="2256.29" dur="5.97">hugely illegal it&amp;#39;s very unethical it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2259.8" dur="5.61">very dangerous to the patient in fact to</text>
  <text start="2262.26" dur="5.13">do that because even for example when</text>
  <text start="2265.41" dur="4.65">you think about it if a woman is</text>
  <text start="2267.39" dur="5.28">pregnant and she&amp;#39;s you know wanting to</text>
  <text start="2270.06" dur="5.1">deliver her baby and they always track</text>
  <text start="2272.67" dur="5.04">where the baby is and if they find that</text>
  <text start="2275.16" dur="4.68">during an ultrasound that the baby is in</text>
  <text start="2277.71" dur="5.76">breech position for example where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2279.84" dur="6.75">feets first they will work to maneuver</text>
  <text start="2283.47" dur="6.09">to change the position because if the</text>
  <text start="2286.59" dur="8.01">baby is delivered breech then that runs</text>
  <text start="2289.56" dur="7.049">the risk of tearing the cervix of the</text>
  <text start="2294.6" dur="4.2">mother where she will not it&amp;#39;s likely</text>
  <text start="2296.609" dur="5.731">she may not be able to carry full-term</text>
  <text start="2298.8" dur="7.01">later on so it can cause damage well in</text>
  <text start="2302.34" dur="6.12">this case they say that they admit to</text>
  <text start="2305.81" dur="5.08">changing the position of the fetus in</text>
  <text start="2308.46" dur="6.03">order to make it breech so that that way</text>
  <text start="2310.89" dur="8.37">they can preserve a quote full cranial</text>
  <text start="2314.49" dur="6.66">specimen and they&amp;#39;ll do that without the</text>
  <text start="2319.26" dur="5.46">patient&amp;#39;s consent without their</text>
  <text start="2321.15" dur="6.18">knowledge anything they can do to get</text>
  <text start="2324.72" dur="8.36">the most intact specimen possible</text>
  <text start="2327.33" dur="10.89">because that is where the money is and</text>
  <text start="2333.08" dur="6.67">so this is really a big deal and this is</text>
  <text start="2338.22" dur="2.1">what they should be talking about in the</text>
  <text start="2339.75" dur="3.33">media</text>
  <text start="2340.32" dur="6.18">that this company that cleans to be so</text>
  <text start="2343.08" dur="11.49">benevolent that they&amp;#39;re pumping full of</text>
  <text start="2346.5" dur="13.53">money so many donors also taxpayers pay</text>
  <text start="2354.57" dur="8.37">for Planned Parenthood it&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="2360.03" dur="4.83">biggest money machines and they try to</text>
  <text start="2362.94" dur="4.5">claim that it is a benevolent</text>
  <text start="2364.86" dur="7.31">organization that really works to</text>
  <text start="2367.44" dur="4.73">protect women&amp;#39;s reproductive rights and</text>
  <text start="2373.52" dur="8.98">promotes women&amp;#39;s reproductive health no</text>
  <text start="2376.95" dur="11.07">it doesn&amp;#39;t and so this case should be</text>
  <text start="2382.5" dur="8.04">exposing that because what is being</text>
  <text start="2388.02" dur="6.12">exposed in these hearings is horrific if</text>
  <text start="2390.54" dur="5.7">you saw these videos they are horrific</text>
  <text start="2394.14" dur="3.99">and in fact it should be noted that</text>
  <text start="2396.24" dur="5.19">they&amp;#39;ve already put those videos through</text>
  <text start="2398.13" dur="5.37">an independent forensic investigation</text>
  <text start="2401.43" dur="4.5">and it&amp;#39;s been found that those videos</text>
  <text start="2403.5" dur="4.68">were not altered even though in the</text>
  <text start="2405.93" dur="6.05">media they try to claim that those</text>
  <text start="2408.18" dur="3.8">videos were altered but they were not</text>
  <text start="2413.78" dur="8.23">they were not so while they should be</text>
  <text start="2417.99" dur="6.57">talking about all of these horrific</text>
  <text start="2422.01" dur="4.74">crimes that the abortion industry</text>
  <text start="2424.56" dur="7.41">including with Planned Parenthood at the</text>
  <text start="2426.75" dur="8.16">head of it that they are guilty of these</text>
  <text start="2431.97" dur="4.59">things by their own admission no one is</text>
  <text start="2434.91" dur="6.45">talking about that really and in fact</text>
  <text start="2436.56" dur="8.07">this whole case is really an attempt to</text>
  <text start="2441.36" dur="10.2">prosecute these journalists for exposing</text>
  <text start="2444.63" dur="14.67">that information they are facing up to</text>
  <text start="2451.56" dur="9.96">ten years for each count now this</text>
  <text start="2459.3" dur="4.74">article right here is talking about one</text>
  <text start="2461.52" dur="6.12">of the updates from last Friday where</text>
  <text start="2464.04" dur="9.18">they were seeking to have the search</text>
  <text start="2467.64" dur="7.709">warrant found to be invalid so</text>
  <text start="2473.22" dur="3.45">then if that happens then some of the</text>
  <text start="2475.349" dur="3.841">charges will be dropped</text>
  <text start="2476.67" dur="4.83">not all of them there it will not cover</text>
  <text start="2479.19" dur="5.28">all of the charges but it will cover</text>
  <text start="2481.5" dur="6.95">some of them now here&amp;#39;s the interesting</text>
  <text start="2484.47" dur="8.16">thing about that is that apparently</text>
  <text start="2488.45" dur="8.169">Kamala Harris was the one who had</text>
  <text start="2492.63" dur="6.57">ordered that raid on their apartment to</text>
  <text start="2496.619" dur="5.761">get those videotapes and so they</text>
  <text start="2499.2" dur="4.919">confiscated all of the video evidence</text>
  <text start="2502.38" dur="4.83">that they had now fortunately they had</text>
  <text start="2504.119" dur="6.291">backups in other places so they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2507.21" dur="8.09">able to obtain all of the video evidence</text>
  <text start="2510.41" dur="8.909">but apparently the lead ins lawyers have</text>
  <text start="2515.3" dur="7.36">evidence of communications via email</text>
  <text start="2519.319" dur="5.651">between Planned Parenthood and Kamala</text>
  <text start="2522.66" dur="6.03">Harris and of course mind you Planned</text>
  <text start="2524.97" dur="8.22">Parenthood had recently donated $15,000</text>
  <text start="2528.69" dur="7.35">to Kamala Harris&amp;#39;s campaign and so in</text>
  <text start="2533.19" dur="4.59">one of the email exchanges between</text>
  <text start="2536.04" dur="3.69">Planned Parenthood and Kamala Harris</text>
  <text start="2537.78" dur="3.99">Planned Parenthood had actually said</text>
  <text start="2539.73" dur="4.26">this to Kamala they said quote we need</text>
  <text start="2541.77" dur="3.72">you to seize those unreleased tapes so</text>
  <text start="2543.99" dur="1.95">that they can never be released to the</text>
  <text start="2545.49" dur="2.52">public</text>
  <text start="2545.94" dur="6.02">take them away from delete and make sure</text>
  <text start="2548.01" dur="3.95">he doesn&amp;#39;t have them end quote</text>
  <text start="2552.619" dur="8.071">you don&amp;#39;t get any more obvious than that</text>
  <text start="2555.869" dur="4.821">you don&amp;#39;t get any more corrupt than that</text>
  <text start="2561.619" dur="9.551">they know that those videos expose them</text>
  <text start="2565.98" dur="8.01">for their crimes and so they cannot</text>
  <text start="2571.17" dur="5.429">allow the public to see so what do they</text>
  <text start="2573.99" dur="7.5">do they reach out to bought and paid for</text>
  <text start="2576.599" dur="7.081">Kamala Harris now also what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2581.49" dur="5.94">unfortunate about this whole thing too</text>
  <text start="2583.68" dur="6.149">is that the current prosecution is</text>
  <text start="2587.43" dur="3.899">trying to issue a gag order after this</text>
  <text start="2589.829" dur="4.561">information came out one of the</text>
  <text start="2591.329" dur="3.571">preliminary hearings is said that the</text>
  <text start="2594.39" dur="2.16">lead-ins</text>
  <text start="2594.9" dur="3.6">attorney told the court that stem</text>
  <text start="2596.55" dur="3.84">Express was mentioned regarding the</text>
  <text start="2598.5" dur="5.01">Stanford University study in which the</text>
  <text start="2600.39" dur="5.969">language oft perfusion was used when Joe</text>
  <text start="2603.51" dur="3.33">12 the CEO of stem express whose name is</text>
  <text start="2606.359" dur="2.971">being</text>
  <text start="2606.84" dur="4.62">tected was asked on the stand if stem</text>
  <text start="2609.33" dur="5.28">express supplied fetal hearts to</text>
  <text start="2611.46" dur="5.07">Stanford she hesitated to reply judge</text>
  <text start="2614.61" dur="4.68">height pressed her and she admitted that</text>
  <text start="2616.53" dur="8.58">stem Express has quote provided heart</text>
  <text start="2619.29" dur="7.37">tissue to Stanford and quote so as soon</text>
  <text start="2625.11" dur="6.84">as they were talking about harvesting</text>
  <text start="2626.66" dur="7.81">heart tissue and brains then they decide</text>
  <text start="2631.95" dur="4.71">they want to issue a gag order they also</text>
  <text start="2634.47" dur="10.2">don&amp;#39;t want to include this into the</text>
  <text start="2636.66" dur="13.29">evidence so they&amp;#39;re working to make this</text>
  <text start="2644.67" dur="11.33">case as difficult as possible for</text>
  <text start="2649.95" dur="9.27">deleting also unfortunately in this case</text>
  <text start="2656" dur="6.07">the judge will be overseeing it he</text>
  <text start="2659.22" dur="7.83">apparently has connections with Planned</text>
  <text start="2662.07" dur="7.32">Parenthood I don&amp;#39;t really understand why</text>
  <text start="2667.05" dur="4.05">then he is the one who is overseeing</text>
  <text start="2669.39" dur="4.17">this case other than the fact that the</text>
  <text start="2671.1" dur="4.62">justice system is corrupt anyway but</text>
  <text start="2673.56" dur="6.93">this judge who has ties to Planned</text>
  <text start="2675.72" dur="7.68">Parenthood will be overseeing the jury</text>
  <text start="2680.49" dur="14.15">pick he will be handpicking the jury</text>
  <text start="2683.4" dur="14.51">himself for October 2nd so this tells me</text>
  <text start="2694.64" dur="8.86">that it&amp;#39;s likely the judge will pick</text>
  <text start="2697.91" dur="11.59">those who he thinks will not necessarily</text>
  <text start="2703.5" dur="9.65">rule and delete in its favor this whole</text>
  <text start="2709.5" dur="3.65">case is corrupt from top to bottom</text>
  <text start="2713.99" dur="7.53">the implications of this there are a</text>
  <text start="2717.09" dur="7.14">couple of things one is that</text>
  <text start="2721.52" dur="5.1">investigative journalists need to be</text>
  <text start="2724.23" dur="5.34">able to do their jobs</text>
  <text start="2726.62" dur="7.87">that is what investigative journalism is</text>
  <text start="2729.57" dur="6.75">you work to expose truth expose crimes</text>
  <text start="2734.49" dur="4.23">if there&amp;#39;s criminal activity going on</text>
  <text start="2736.32" dur="3.39">and an investigative journalist can do</text>
  <text start="2738.72" dur="3.42">the legwork to</text>
  <text start="2739.71" dur="9.33">suppose it by all means they should be</text>
  <text start="2742.14" dur="8.76">able to do that but instead the message</text>
  <text start="2749.04" dur="5.4">that they&amp;#39;re sending with this case is</text>
  <text start="2750.9" dur="7.709">that if you work to investigate the</text>
  <text start="2754.44" dur="14.01">crimes of powerful organizations you</text>
  <text start="2758.609" dur="12.211">will lose and on top of that all of the</text>
  <text start="2768.45" dur="7.139">work that you&amp;#39;ve just done now means</text>
  <text start="2770.82" dur="7.289">nothing because they&amp;#39;re not even</text>
  <text start="2775.589" dur="9.301">focusing on that they admitted in court</text>
  <text start="2778.109" dur="8.461">that they did these things which is no</text>
  <text start="2784.89" dur="3.93">surprise because when you look at the</text>
  <text start="2786.57" dur="6">videos that it is very hard to refute</text>
  <text start="2788.82" dur="5.22">that you cannot refute that they tried</text>
  <text start="2792.57" dur="3.84">to claim that they were altered but then</text>
  <text start="2794.04" dur="5.1">of course an investigation revealed that</text>
  <text start="2796.41" dur="7.65">they were not altered so why are these</text>
  <text start="2799.14" dur="7.05">journalists on trial so number one this</text>
  <text start="2804.06" dur="9.18">is a threats of course to the First</text>
  <text start="2806.19" dur="9.99">Amendment and number two abortion</text>
  <text start="2813.24" dur="9.65">industry agencies including Planned</text>
  <text start="2816.18" dur="6.71">Parenthood they need to be shut down</text>
  <text start="2825.14" dur="12.76">this is not okay right now there is a</text>
  <text start="2834.81" dur="9.66">huge amount of support for Planned</text>
  <text start="2837.9" dur="14.28">Parenthood from the left and a lot of</text>
  <text start="2844.47" dur="10.649">everyday folks are completely fooled by</text>
  <text start="2852.18" dur="7.62">this organization thinking that they are</text>
  <text start="2855.119" dur="8.281">doing good work that they&amp;#39;re concerned</text>
  <text start="2859.8" dur="10.44">for reproductive health and concern for</text>
  <text start="2863.4" dur="9.03">women&amp;#39;s rights no they are not they are</text>
  <text start="2870.24" dur="11.28">committing evil on a grain</text>
  <text start="2872.43" dur="12.27">and scale for profits this means to be</text>
  <text start="2881.52" dur="6.66">plastered everywhere this needs to be</text>
  <text start="2884.7" dur="11.7">shown to everybody everybody needs to</text>
  <text start="2888.18" dur="12.15">know about this this should not they</text>
  <text start="2896.4" dur="16.65">should not be allowed to operate any</text>
  <text start="2900.33" dur="18.48">longer this has to end now and really we</text>
  <text start="2913.05" dur="7.68">should be using this case to expose them</text>
  <text start="2918.81" dur="6.72">for who they really are</text>
  <text start="2920.73" dur="8.24">this should not be a smear campaign</text>
  <text start="2925.53" dur="6.66">against these journalists these</text>
  <text start="2928.97" dur="8.59">journalists should not be on trial</text>
  <text start="2932.19" dur="8.79">Planned Parenthood should be in any</text>
  <text start="2937.56" dur="6.27">other agency like stem express that was</text>
  <text start="2940.98" dur="12.66">exposed in this whole investigative</text>
  <text start="2943.83" dur="11.73">report people need to know about this so</text>
  <text start="2953.64" dur="6.06">I&amp;#39;ll be following this story very very</text>
