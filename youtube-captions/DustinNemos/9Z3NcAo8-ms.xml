  <text start="186.57" dur="7.92">country well um almost without exception</text>
  <text start="190.98" dur="4.67">every foreign leader in South America is</text>
  <text start="194.49" dur="4.62">corrupt to the bone</text>
  <text start="195.65" dur="4.78">Maduro is no different I believe the guy</text>
  <text start="199.11" dur="4.32">that they&amp;#39;re trying to put in his place</text>
  <text start="200.43" dur="4.92">works for the CIA he&amp;#39;s bought and paid</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="4.98">for just like no Diego and Panama was</text>
  <text start="205.35" dur="4.89">bought and paid for by the CIA um I</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t think we should be doing this I</text>
  <text start="210.24" dur="5.22">think it&amp;#39;s very very bad I believe the</text>
  <text start="213.09" dur="4.32">president is either doing it to keep the</text>
  <text start="215.46" dur="4.8">Zionists distracted and the neo-cons</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="6.39">distracted or he&amp;#39;s been lied to</text>

  <text start="223.8" dur="6.06">Maduro is running drugs big time so</text>
  <text start="226.65" dur="5.94">where George HW Bush Bill Clinton Barack</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="4.8">Obama okay this whole idea of</text>
  <text start="232.59" dur="3.75">sovereignty and not interfering in the</text>
  <text start="234.66" dur="4.11">sovereign affairs or the internal</text>
  <text start="236.34" dur="4.05">affairs of other nations is a very very</text>
  <text start="238.77" dur="4.61">important principle in international</text>
  <text start="240.39" dur="5.82">relations so I lean toward the president</text>

  <text start="248.31" dur="4.71">people a chance to hang themselves and I</text>
  <text start="250.95" dur="5.07">was very pleased with my article which</text>
  <text start="253.02" dur="4.77">which had a fake news headline that said</text>
  <text start="256.02" dur="4.02">that with Trump setting the precedent</text>
  <text start="257.79" dur="4.56">China Iran Russia and Turkey all</text>

  <text start="272.71" dur="6.179">very humorous but but eerie predictor of</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="2.76">what what really could happen one day we</text>

  <text start="888.24" dur="3.96">Bolton is not someone I fully understand</text>
  <text start="890.55" dur="5.91">his history but I know he&amp;#39;s obviously a</text>

  <text start="936.75" dur="4.47">they&amp;#39;re mine and then just what an</text>
  <text start="938.55" dur="4.95">example made so that it stops well I I</text>
  <text start="941.22" dur="4.26">think you know I really thought about</text>
  <text start="943.5" dur="4.08">this a lot and I happen to know the top</text>
  <text start="945.48" dur="5.97">and Tara Gator colonel in the United</text>
  <text start="947.58" dur="5.82">States of America and the bottom line</text>
  <text start="951.45" dur="4.32">here is people give up more information</text>
  <text start="953.4" dur="5.97">if they&amp;#39;re not terrified of just being</text>
  <text start="955.77" dur="6.39">put to death truth and reconciliation is</text>
  <text start="959.37" dur="6.089">an intelligent solicitation strategy</text>
  <text start="962.16" dur="6">that is huge dividends and so if you do</text>
  <text start="965.459" dur="5.641">truth conciliation with the bottom 90 to</text>
  <text start="968.16" dur="6.96">95 percent you end up being able to hang</text>
  <text start="971.1" dur="8.37">the top 5% okay so it&amp;#39;s a very very</text>
  <text start="975.12" dur="6.93">clearly understood strategy um and so</text>
  <text start="979.47" dur="4.229">when people push back at me I look I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="982.05" dur="3.539">trying to clean the place up I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="983.699" dur="3.541">not trying to forgive everybody well I</text>
  <text start="985.589" dur="3.511">think we&amp;#39;re in the same boat here I mean</text>
  <text start="987.24" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s the top 5% really a bit matter</text>
  <text start="989.1" dur="4.02">like I said examples but well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="991.38" dur="3.629">let&amp;#39;s take Congress as an example</text>
  <text start="993.12" dur="4.199">they&amp;#39;re all being bribed in blackmailed</text>
  <text start="995.009" dur="6.031">okay with the possible exception of Rand</text>
  <text start="997.319" dur="5.671">Paul and so what you do and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1001.04" dur="4.109">suggested this multiple times the</text>
  <text start="1002.99" dur="4.38">president creates a presidential</text>
  <text start="1005.149" dur="4.591">counterintelligence task force staffed</text>
  <text start="1007.37" dur="4.019">by both retired military brought back on</text>
  <text start="1009.74" dur="4.709">an active duty military because the FBI</text>
  <text start="1011.389" dur="4.081">is out to lunch well the FBI is not an</text>
  <text start="1014.449" dur="4.531">effective counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1015.47" dur="5.22">counterterrorism force and so you you do</text>
  <text start="1018.98" dur="3.799">that you create that and then you go to</text>
  <text start="1020.69" dur="4.859">every member of Congress and you say</text>
  <text start="1022.779" dur="4.691">we&amp;#39;re going to debrief you if you give</text>

  <text start="1031.189" dur="6.15">you get an instant presidential pardon</text>
  <text start="1033.949" dur="6.21">and we take out the blackmailers and the</text>
  <text start="1037.339" dur="5.671">bribers okay this is how I work but this</text>
  <text start="1040.159" dur="5.28">is not how the president has been taught</text>
  <text start="1043.01" dur="3.63">to think in terms of this kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="1045.439" dur="3.24">and he doesn&amp;#39;t have a staff that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1046.64" dur="4.47">willing to tell him this doesn&amp;#39;t he have</text>
  <text start="1048.679" dur="6.48">his own like shadow quasi intelligence</text>
  <text start="1051.11" dur="6.42">like private staff he did something with</text>
  <text start="1055.159" dur="3.75">Flynn and there&amp;#39;s some Israeli outfits</text>
  <text start="1057.53" dur="4.019">that are trying to tell him that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1058.909" dur="4.291">the answer to his dreams and my bottom</text>
  <text start="1061.549" dur="4.201">line is I think the president is being</text>
  <text start="1063.2" dur="5.459">lied to 80% of the time and the other</text>
  <text start="1065.75" dur="4.74">20% he&amp;#39;s getting I&amp;#39;ll remind people</text>
  <text start="1068.659" dur="3.75">that general Tony&amp;#39;s any when he was</text>
  <text start="1070.49" dur="4.59">commanding general of CENTCOM said that</text>
  <text start="1072.409" dur="4.201">at best he got four percent of what he</text>

  <text start="1076.61" dur="4.35">community okay these people don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1079.25" dur="3.419">most of the threats they don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1080.96" dur="3.48">policies they don&amp;#39;t do compare and</text>
  <text start="1082.669" dur="3.571">contrast they don&amp;#39;t do true cost</text>
  <text start="1084.44" dur="4.8">economics I mean a McDonald&amp;#39;s quarter</text>
  <text start="1086.24" dur="4.74">pounders $250 if you add up all the</text>

  <text start="1229.8" dur="5.6">so I&amp;#39;m gonna review it the bottom line</text>
  <text start="1232.38" dur="5.7">on this book is that Jared Kushner</text>
  <text start="1235.4" dur="6.7">totally screwed his father-in-law</text>
  <text start="1238.08" dur="6.42">um Kristy had a beautiful transition he</text>
  <text start="1242.1" dur="4.29">had it all set up Donald Trump would</text>
  <text start="1244.5" dur="4.83">have hit the ground running Jared</text>
  <text start="1246.39" dur="5.13">Kushner killed that because Jared</text>
  <text start="1249.33" dur="3.99">Kushner is a spoiled little kid who has</text>
  <text start="1251.52" dur="3.75">no business being in the White House and</text>
  <text start="1253.32" dur="4.77">he&amp;#39;s angry over Christie putting his</text>
  <text start="1255.27" dur="5.19">father in jail for reasons that</text>
  <text start="1258.09" dur="5.07">obviously a jury saw fit to put the</text>
  <text start="1260.46" dur="4.38">father in jail for so Kushner destroyed</text>
  <text start="1263.16" dur="5.31">Donald Trump&amp;#39;s first year that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1264.84" dur="5.76">bottom line on that book um the other</text>
  <text start="1268.47" dur="3.66">thing there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s kind of a sequel</text>
  <text start="1270.6" dur="4.44">to that&amp;#39;s kind of a finger that people</text>
  <text start="1272.13" dur="5.67">have really both sides hate and love</text>
  <text start="1275.04" dur="4.86">with Kushner for sure I will say that</text>
  <text start="1277.8" dur="4.23">while I have no direct knowledge I am</text>
  <text start="1279.9" dur="4.59">being told by a senior London person</text>
  <text start="1282.03" dur="4.8">that mi6 is saying that Kushner is</text>
  <text start="1284.49" dur="4.95">sexually and financially compromised by</text>
  <text start="1286.83" dur="3.42">at least one Zionist sugar daddy living</text>
  <text start="1289.44" dur="4.17">in New York City</text>
  <text start="1290.25" dur="6.06">I have no direct knowledge but it tracks</text>
  <text start="1293.61" dur="4.8">with me it makes complete sense with</text>
  <text start="1296.31" dur="5.52">what was done to George Bush jr. and</text>
  <text start="1298.41" dur="6.96">several others um I think Jared Kushner</text>
  <text start="1301.83" dur="7.47">is toxic for Donald Trump and Trump is</text>
  <text start="1305.37" dur="6.12">blinded by this because Ivanka his first</text>
  <text start="1309.3" dur="4.29">daughter who should be out across the</text>
  <text start="1311.49" dur="4.11">country cutting ribbons not screwing</text>
  <text start="1313.59" dur="4.08">with staff in the White House she makes</text>
  <text start="1315.6" dur="3.75">him blind to that I think Jared Kushner</text>
  <text start="1317.67" dur="6.03">who by the way should not have</text>
  <text start="1319.35" dur="7.05">clearances two of my CIA colleagues got</text>
  <text start="1323.7" dur="4.47">it right they denied clearances for</text>
  <text start="1326.4" dur="4.59">Jared Kushner because he was a known</text>
  <text start="1328.17" dur="5.55">agent of a foreign power compromised in</text>
  <text start="1330.99" dur="5.37">multiple ways and a political hack and</text>
  <text start="1333.72" dur="4.95">the White House overturned that and gave</text>
  <text start="1336.36" dur="4.17">Kushner clearances that&amp;#39;s gonna blow up</text>
  <text start="1338.67" dur="4.11">in the president&amp;#39;s face it&amp;#39;s um well to</text>
  <text start="1340.53" dur="5.43">be fair I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not just a</text>
  <text start="1342.78" dur="5.1">Kushner issue that&amp;#39;s you know Israel has</text>
  <text start="1345.96" dur="4.71">a lot of influence in our politics oh I</text>
  <text start="1347.88" dur="5.61">agree I mean 10% of the senior executive</text>
  <text start="1350.67" dur="4.8">core is a dual u.s. u.s. u.s. Israeli</text>
  <text start="1353.49" dur="4.05">citizen but let me just finish off this</text>
  <text start="1355.47" dur="3.48">Christy when Christy&amp;#39;s the core point in</text>
  <text start="1357.54" dur="3.87">Christy&amp;#39;s book is a Jared Kushner</text>
  <text start="1358.95" dur="4.32">screwed the president for the first year</text>
  <text start="1361.41" dur="4.41">and I think Christie is right</text>
  <text start="1363.27" dur="5.49">oh but the second point is that because</text>
  <text start="1365.82" dur="4.68">the president came in unprepared he lost</text>
  <text start="1368.76" dur="5.19">control of the office of presidential</text>
  <text start="1370.5" dur="5.91">personnel the GOP establishment was able</text>
  <text start="1373.95" dur="6">to hijack it and then they started</text>
  <text start="1376.41" dur="5.07">putting in GOP people RNC people</text>
  <text start="1379.95" dur="4.14">Republican National Committee people</text>
  <text start="1381.48" dur="6.21">everywhere and as a result the</text>
  <text start="1384.09" dur="6.39">president&amp;#39;s first two years have been a</text>
  <text start="1387.69" dur="4.59">third of what they could have been had</text>
  <text start="1390.48" dur="4.2">he allowed Christie to do his job and</text>
  <text start="1392.28" dur="5.85">not allow Jared Kushner to undermine him</text>
  <text start="1394.68" dur="5.55">so so that&amp;#39;s look I believe it I also</text>
  <text start="1398.13" dur="4.5">think that the president&amp;#39;s a big guy and</text>
  <text start="1400.23" dur="5.58">I believe Christie will come back into</text>
  <text start="1402.63" dur="5.07">the US government um I was hoping you</text>
  <text start="1405.81" dur="3.51">would replace Jefferson sessions that</text>
  <text start="1407.7" dur="4.02">would be my thoughts why would why would</text>
  <text start="1409.32" dur="3.87">Trump not just call that out and look I</text>
  <text start="1411.72" dur="3.18">need to hire the people I want not</text>
  <text start="1413.19" dur="2.16">worried why is the GOP running this</text>
  <text start="1414.9" dur="4.14">thing</text>
  <text start="1415.35" dur="7.35">I don&amp;#39;t think Donald Trump expected to</text>
  <text start="1419.04" dur="5.37">wing um he in Christy&amp;#39;s book he says</text>
  <text start="1422.7" dur="3.84">Trump was violently opposed to the</text>
  <text start="1424.41" dur="7.56">transition and Karen Kushner played to</text>
  <text start="1426.54" dur="8.07">that um but he also I think I cannot</text>
  <text start="1431.97" dur="5.31">begin to conceptualize the the degree of</text>
  <text start="1434.61" dur="5.01">detail and and angst that the president</text>
  <text start="1437.28" dur="3.42">faces every minute of every day I mean</text>
  <text start="1439.62" dur="3.3">you&amp;#39;re the most powerful guy in the</text>
  <text start="1440.7" dur="5.07">planet and everybody wants a piece of</text>
  <text start="1442.92" dur="4.8">your time uh it&amp;#39;s not easy but let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1445.77" dur="4.53">take that two team of vipers because</text>
  <text start="1447.72" dur="4.28">this book the guy is being sued by the</text>
  <text start="1450.3" dur="4.98">president for violating his</text>
  <text start="1452" dur="5.38">confidentiality agreement this book I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1455.28" dur="4.71">just finished reading and I have one</text>
  <text start="1457.38" dur="4.2">word for this book never mind that the</text>
  <text start="1459.99" dur="3.18">guy violated his agreement should</text>
  <text start="1461.58" dur="4.17">probably go to jail or at least have</text>
  <text start="1463.17" dur="6.15">faced civil fines this book is authentic</text>
  <text start="1465.75" dur="5.67">and what this book does is it destroys</text>
  <text start="1469.32" dur="5.76">Steve Bannon and it destroys Kellyanne</text>
  <text start="1471.42" dur="5.58">Conway it&amp;#39;s actually much more favorable</text>
  <text start="1475.08" dur="3.84">to the president than people realize and</text>
  <text start="1477" dur="3.6">I believe that if the president were to</text>
  <text start="1478.92" dur="4.2">read it which he doesn&amp;#39;t he doesn&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="1480.6" dur="4.89">books if the president were to read it</text>
  <text start="1483.12" dur="5.76">he would say to himself you know what</text>
  <text start="1485.49" dur="7.38">this guy gets me this guy supports me</text>
  <text start="1488.88" dur="7.26">this guy wants to see me succeed without</text>
  <text start="1492.87" dur="4.3">having without having read it myself</text>
  <text start="1496.14" dur="4.09">then you</text>
  <text start="1497.17" dur="5.34">in that it kind of paints some of the</text>
  <text start="1500.23" dur="4.47">the leakers as unexpected figures you</text>
  <text start="1502.51" dur="4.44">know like Kellyanne Conway herself as a</text>
  <text start="1504.7" dur="4.62">leaker there&amp;#39;s a section in this book</text>
  <text start="1506.95" dur="4.8">where Kelly and Conway asks him to to</text>
  <text start="1509.32" dur="4.44">write some stuff on her computer and</text>
  <text start="1511.75" dur="3.69">she&amp;#39;s got this messaging stuff that</text>
  <text start="1513.76" dur="4.17">shows up on her computer and her phone</text>
  <text start="1515.44" dur="4.98">and he says as he&amp;#39;s typing this memo for</text>
  <text start="1517.93" dur="5.28">Kelly he&amp;#39;s seeing her carrying on over</text>
  <text start="1520.42" dur="5.55">15 different conversations in which</text>
  <text start="1523.21" dur="5.28">she&amp;#39;s bad-mouthing the president with</text>
  <text start="1525.97" dur="4.32">different journalists outside I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1528.49" dur="3.66">know if that&amp;#39;s true or not but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1530.29" dur="4.14">inclined to believe it I&amp;#39;m inclined to</text>
  <text start="1532.15" dur="5.12">believe that almost everybody in the</text>
  <text start="1534.43" dur="5.28">White House is playing the system and</text>
  <text start="1537.27" dur="4.3">they&amp;#39;re telling Trump one thing to his</text>
  <text start="1539.71" dur="4.26">face and they&amp;#39;re telling other people</text>
  <text start="1541.57" dur="4.11">different things I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1543.97" dur="4.62">anybody around Trump that he can trust</text>
  <text start="1545.68" dur="4.17">and I it bothers me for example that two</text>
  <text start="1548.59" dur="4.41">of the people he could trust</text>
  <text start="1549.85" dur="5.94">Keith his his his security guy and hope</text>
  <text start="1553" dur="4.62">is his kind of final word on press stuff</text>
  <text start="1555.79" dur="4.35">they were all pushed out in the White</text>
  <text start="1557.62" dur="3.72">House it&amp;#39;s as if the the Chiefs of Staff</text>
  <text start="1560.14" dur="3.33">of the White House have been</text>
  <text start="1561.34" dur="3.71">systematically trying to strip Donald</text>
  <text start="1563.47" dur="3.84">Trump with people he trusts and</text>
  <text start="1565.05" dur="4.63">unfortunately the only two that are left</text>
  <text start="1567.31" dur="4.47">are Jared Kushner Ivanka Trump but I</text>
  <text start="1569.68" dur="4.86">will tell you right now the president</text>
  <text start="1571.78" dur="4.74">while he will be reelected will not be</text>
  <text start="1574.54" dur="4.53">the greatest president ever unless he</text>
  <text start="1576.52" dur="4.83">gets Kushner and Bolton out of the White</text>
  <text start="1579.07" dur="3.9">House and the easiest way to do that is</text>
  <text start="1581.35" dur="3.23">for Ivanka to get pregnant they need to</text>
  <text start="1582.97" dur="4.41">go home and take care of the baby um</text>
  <text start="1584.58" dur="4.42">because this White House is a mess as</text>
  <text start="1587.38" dur="4.04">long as Kushner and Bolton are in there</text>
  <text start="1589" dur="5.04">yeah fair enough</text>
  <text start="1591.42" dur="4.03">Wow so we&amp;#39;ve covered a lot of ground</text>
  <text start="1594.04" dur="3.57">here that&amp;#39;s very interesting</text>
  <text start="1595.45" dur="5.07">of course it the appropriate way to look</text>
  <text start="1597.61" dur="6.33">at people is not on/off loyal not loyal</text>
  <text start="1600.52" dur="5.07">but as a as a different collection of</text>
  <text start="1603.94" dur="3.45">varied interests and everyone has their</text>
  <text start="1605.59" dur="3.81">own personal interests and that in</text>
  <text start="1607.39" dur="3.75">interacts with their personal loyalties</text>
  <text start="1609.4" dur="5.22">and everything else there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1611.14" dur="4.98">things that go into this yeah you know</text>
  <text start="1614.62" dur="4.4">you you make an interesting point let me</text>
  <text start="1616.12" dur="5.63">tell you what&amp;#39;s not in all of this</text>
  <text start="1619.02" dur="6.12">nobody in the White House is doing</text>
  <text start="1621.75" dur="5.86">strategy in a grand strategy sense</text>

  <text start="1636.27" dur="4.019">they&amp;#39;re literally the white house as</text>
  <text start="1637.77" dur="7.35">best I can tell is plain to the daily</text>
  <text start="1640.289" dur="6.63">headline okay they&amp;#39;re not strategic even</text>
  <text start="1645.12" dur="4.89">though the president has had a number of</text>

  <text start="1742.799" dur="3.99">yeah she&amp;#39;s hurt what was her big fence</text>
  <text start="1745.26" dur="2.88">idea I don&amp;#39;t remember the name of it but</text>
  <text start="1746.789" dur="4.651">is basically something you can walk</text>
  <text start="1748.14" dur="6.96">through you&amp;#39;ll see Pelosi is playing</text>
  <text start="1751.44" dur="6.209">Trump and and not as well as she could</text>
  <text start="1755.1" dur="5.28">but anyway so bottom line here is if</text>
  <text start="1757.649" dur="5.941">Trump creates the election Reform Act</text>
  <text start="1760.38" dur="4.26">then here&amp;#39;s what happens in 2020 one</text>
  <text start="1763.59" dur="2.82">third of Congress</text>
  <text start="1764.64" dur="4.62">would be independent and small party</text>
  <text start="1766.41" dur="4.47">yeah one-third would be democratic one</text>
  <text start="1769.26" dur="3.39">third would be Republican what does this</text>
  <text start="1770.88" dur="5.04">mean it means that neither one of the</text>
  <text start="1772.65" dur="5.01">two parties can control Congress and at</text>
  <text start="1775.92" dur="4.47">that point you have an evidence base</text>
  <text start="1777.66" dur="5.49">Congress and now the president can work</text>
  <text start="1780.39" dur="4.92">with his charisma getting everybody</text>
  <text start="1783.15" dur="4.47">across America to listen to him and he</text>
  <text start="1785.31" dur="3.96">can educate America and at the same time</text>
  <text start="1787.62" dur="3.72">he can go to Congress and say these are</text>
  <text start="1789.27" dur="3.51">the facts these are the costs this is</text>
  <text start="1791.34" dur="3.57">why I want to do this and this and this</text>
  <text start="1792.78" dur="4.59">and let&amp;#39;s start by closing all of our</text>
  <text start="1794.91" dur="4.14">military bases overseas bring all of our</text>
  <text start="1797.37" dur="3.96">troops their families their wallets and</text>
  <text start="1799.05" dur="4.92">all of our equipment all let&amp;#39;s build the</text>
  <text start="1801.33" dur="4.98">wall and let&amp;#39;s reach wrench I mean these</text>
  <text start="1803.97" dur="5.67">are basic ideas that everyone wants for</text>
  <text start="1806.31" dur="5.67">the most part I also wanted to ask you</text>
  <text start="1809.64" dur="4.38">last time we had you on you know there</text>
  <text start="1811.98" dur="5.06">was a lot of comments some good some bad</text>
  <text start="1814.02" dur="5.25">you know because CIA thing really</text>
  <text start="1817.04" dur="4.81">certain people will just assume certain</text>
  <text start="1819.27" dur="3.78">things about you because of that and you</text>
  <text start="1821.85" dur="3.06">explained it to me that there are</text>
  <text start="1823.05" dur="4.13">different factions even within the CIA</text>
  <text start="1824.91" dur="4.56">and that would make sense</text>
  <text start="1827.18" dur="6.13">how do you normally explain that to</text>
  <text start="1829.47" dur="5.58">people like I mean let me let me start</text>
  <text start="1833.31" dur="5.01">by addressing the morons to think I</text>
  <text start="1835.05" dur="5.67">still work for CIA and and I finally got</text>
  <text start="1838.32" dur="4.35">my Wikipedia page burned to the ground</text>
  <text start="1840.72" dur="4.26">but there&amp;#39;s still a little left over</text>
  <text start="1842.67" dur="4.41">here and some moron and Wikipedia keeps</text>
  <text start="1844.98" dur="4.29">inserting Central Intelligence Agency is</text>
  <text start="1847.08" dur="6.26">my employer I stopped working for</text>
  <text start="1849.27" dur="7.83">Central Intelligence on the 15th of June</text>
  <text start="1853.34" dur="5.77">1988 okay I have eight books on</text>
  <text start="1857.1" dur="5.13">intelligence reform two with four words</text>
  <text start="1859.11" dur="7.76">by US senators all of which say CIA is</text>
  <text start="1862.23" dur="7.71"> okay now if you&amp;#39;re too stupid to</text>
  <text start="1866.87" dur="5.74">read those books and understand that no</text>
  <text start="1869.94" dur="4.86">I am not working for CIA then god help</text>
  <text start="1872.61" dur="5.19">you and last but not least I have behind</text>
  <text start="1874.8" dur="4.62">me a fireplace that fireplace is there</text>
  <text start="1877.8" dur="6.21">for the morons that think I&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="1879.42" dur="8.13">backdrop okay so having said that let me</text>
  <text start="1884.01" dur="5.55">say there at least seven CIA&amp;#39;s and I</text>
  <text start="1887.55" dur="4.2">would say that 90% of the people that</text>
  <text start="1889.56" dur="5.64">work at CIA are good people trapped in a</text>
  <text start="1891.75" dur="5.85">bad system the real evil is done by 10%</text>
  <text start="1895.2" dur="3.33">so there&amp;#39;s the kind of legal legitimate</text>
  <text start="1897.6" dur="4.35">CI</text>
  <text start="1898.53" dur="6.21">that that has analysts and scientists</text>
  <text start="1901.95" dur="5.46">and technology and logisticians admin</text>
  <text start="1904.74" dur="5.58">and case officers on the street who are</text>
  <text start="1907.41" dur="4.26">working under official cover let me tell</text>
  <text start="1910.32" dur="3.24">you right now with the exception of</text>
  <text start="1911.67" dur="3.51">Moscow Beijing and New Delhi if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1913.56" dur="4.56">working under official cover you are</text>
  <text start="1915.18" dur="5.91">known to local liaison you&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="1918.12" dur="5.13">a spy okay especially today with all the</text>
  <text start="1921.09" dur="5.07">cell phone tracking and GPS stuff and</text>
  <text start="1923.25" dur="4.56">all of that so CIA the nice legal</text>
  <text start="1926.16" dur="4.8">ethical case officers they&amp;#39;re just going</text>
  <text start="1927.81" dur="5.73">through the motions on then you have the</text>
  <text start="1930.96" dur="4.68">White House CIA which is the dirty trick</text>
  <text start="1933.54" dur="3.84">CIA those are the people that break into</text>
  <text start="1935.64" dur="3.63">the Watergate and by the way the</text>
  <text start="1937.38" dur="6.93">Watergate was all about getting the</text>
  <text start="1939.27" dur="6.78">Democratic Peter I heard that name yes</text>
  <text start="1944.31" dur="6.89">he wanted the book that listed all the</text>
  <text start="1946.05" dur="7.53">demographic pedo files okay um now the</text>
  <text start="1951.2" dur="5.38">so you have the White House CIA then you</text>
  <text start="1953.58" dur="6.9">have the Wall Street CIA ah Dustin I</text>
  <text start="1956.58" dur="5.67">can&amp;#39;t see you does it matter uh well I</text>

  <text start="1965.4" dur="5.01">yeah you&amp;#39;re back okay so let&amp;#39;s start</text>
  <text start="1967.59" dur="5.37">over so basically seven CIA so you have</text>
  <text start="1970.41" dur="5.43">a White House CIA that will do dirty</text>
  <text start="1972.96" dur="4.74">tricks for the President and that&amp;#39;s if</text>
  <text start="1975.84" dur="4.11">they like the president if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1977.7" dur="3.96">like president they might not then you</text>
  <text start="1979.95" dur="6.54">have the wall street CIA there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1981.66" dur="7.11">wonderful book by Talbott um I forget</text>
  <text start="1986.49" dur="5.07">what the title is but it&amp;#39;s it says the</text>
  <text start="1988.77" dur="6.45">devil in it and it basically talks about</text>
  <text start="1991.56" dur="6.45">how CIA was created by Wall Street it</text>
  <text start="1995.22" dur="5.31">was put over on Truman and CIA was</text>
  <text start="1998.01" dur="5.07">created as Wall Street secret entity</text>
  <text start="2000.53" dur="6.84">inside the US government able to do</text>
  <text start="2003.08" dur="6.87">things like smuggle drugs guns cash gold</text>
  <text start="2007.37" dur="3.96">and small children and that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="2009.95" dur="3.84">reasons I want to close all our military</text>
  <text start="2011.33" dur="6.3">bases overseas because they are lilypads</text>
  <text start="2013.79" dur="5.91">for CIA and dinah core and portions of</text>
  <text start="2017.63" dur="5.34">the military that have gone rogue to</text>
  <text start="2019.7" dur="5.46">smuggle drugs guns gold cash and small</text>
  <text start="2022.97" dur="5.49">children and we don&amp;#39;t want to be paying</text>
  <text start="2025.16" dur="5.58">for these spaces are not about national</text>
  <text start="2028.46" dur="3.569">defense these bases are about smuggling</text>
  <text start="2030.74" dur="3.659">and spent</text>
  <text start="2032.029" dur="5.551">money and bribing dictators and so forth</text>
  <text start="2034.399" dur="6.691">so you have the Wall Street CIA then you</text>
  <text start="2037.58" dur="6.089">have the Zionists CIA this is the</text>
  <text start="2041.09" dur="6.059">portion of the CIA that enables Zionist</text>
  <text start="2043.669" dur="6.21">atrocities worldwide it&amp;#39;s a support</text>
  <text start="2047.149" dur="4.861">element and it also works with the FBI</text>
  <text start="2049.879" dur="2.91">to give the Zionists a free pass here in</text>
  <text start="2052.01" dur="3.539">the USA</text>
  <text start="2052.789" dur="5.07">we have Mossad officers with FBI</text>

  <text start="2065.21" dur="5.699">get away with it um then you have the</text>
  <text start="2067.819" dur="5.941">drone assassination CIA that&amp;#39;s the CIA</text>
  <text start="2070.909" dur="6.02">that is killing people worldwide and CIA</text>
  <text start="2073.76" dur="5.639">has no business being in the armed drone</text>
  <text start="2076.929" dur="4.21">business okay this is insane</text>
  <text start="2079.399" dur="2.97">if I were director the CIA that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2081.139" dur="2.91">first thing that would be transferred to</text>
  <text start="2082.369" dur="3.81">the Pentagon and then you have the</text>
  <text start="2084.049" dur="5.25">rendition and torture CIA which we call</text>
  <text start="2086.179" dur="5.551">the Saudi or Safari Club CIA that&amp;#39;s paid</text>
