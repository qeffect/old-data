  <text start="306.479" dur="3.301">still could have gotten the line and I</text>
  <text start="308.46" dur="3.209">could have fought it out I fought a lot</text>
  <text start="309.78" dur="4.229">of things in my life and I fought hard</text>
  <text start="311.669" dur="5.011">to be where I am but it made me think</text>
  <text start="314.009" dur="5.91">for all the years that I&amp;#39;ve worked so</text>
  <text start="316.68" dur="6.45">hard and tried to give so much not only</text>
  <text start="319.919" dur="4.93">to the party but to everybody the things</text>
  <text start="323.13" dur="3.369">that we&amp;#39;ve done and I will go</text>
  <text start="324.849" dur="4.74">to them but many many infrastructure</text>
  <text start="326.499" dur="4.831">projects and helping people and all the</text>
  <text start="329.589" dur="4.651">services that we try to give people in</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="6.03">our offices and it all boils down to one</text>
  <text start="334.24" dur="5.639">vote that I may have my own individual</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="4.289">opinion on one vote and that&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="339.879" dur="4.32">to be allowed I&amp;#39;m going to be punished</text>
  <text start="341.649" dur="5.19">for that and that&amp;#39;s when I knew I had</text>
  <text start="344.199" dur="4.381">been thinking about it for a while and I</text>
  <text start="346.839" dur="3.931">said and you know I was speaking to my</text>
  <text start="348.58" dur="3.839">chief of staff about this and and I said</text>
  <text start="350.77" dur="5.459">to her I said you know there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="5.881">been in my career and over time</text>
  <text start="356.229" dur="4.261">something that happens that lets you</text>
  <text start="358.3" dur="4.259">know that it is time to make a change</text>
  <text start="360.49" dur="4.349">and this was it you know that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="362.559" dur="5.19">interesting so you were uncomfortable</text>
  <text start="364.839" dur="5.31">with the shaming and you know the the</text>
  <text start="367.749" dur="4.77">pushback that you couldn&amp;#39;t do what you</text>

  <text start="723.61" dur="2.419">article</text>
  <text start="726.4" dur="4.51">Trump not backing down an effort to</text>
  <text start="729.02" dur="4.35">count citizens amid census fight</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="6.21">announces executive order this from July</text>
  <text start="733.37" dur="5.01">11th of this year now of course the only</text>
  <text start="737.12" dur="3.21">questions that they&amp;#39;re really allowed to</text>
  <text start="738.38" dur="4.19">ask you on the census is how many people</text>
  <text start="740.33" dur="3.6">in the household and are you a citizen</text>
  <text start="742.57" dur="3.1">that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="743.93" dur="3.95">the rest of the questions are as I</text>
  <text start="745.67" dur="4.77">understand it optional and not</text>
  <text start="747.88" dur="5.49">constitutionally required now those two</text>
  <text start="750.44" dur="6.33">questions are constitutionally required</text>
  <text start="753.37" dur="5.62">hew says and of course why would you</text>
  <text start="756.77" dur="4.14">block the two things in the census from</text>
  <text start="758.99" dur="3">being asked that are the constitutional</text>
  <text start="760.91" dur="3.54">requirements unless you have something</text>
  <text start="761.99" dur="4.11">to hide you says why are Democrats</text>
  <text start="764.45" dur="5.31">attempting to block the counting of</text>
  <text start="766.1" dur="4.89">illegal immigrants 2 plus 2 is 4 so</text>
  <text start="769.76" dur="2.79">therefore it&amp;#39;s rue this is really</text>
  <text start="770.99" dur="3.02">obvious right they&amp;#39;re just trying to</text>
  <text start="772.55" dur="4.26">flood the country to change the vote</text>
  <text start="774.01" dur="6.31">what is the total number of illegal</text>
  <text start="776.81" dur="5.01">immigrants currently in the US I think</text>
  <text start="780.32" dur="4.23">the official numbers are an 11 million</text>
  <text start="781.82" dur="6.21">or something and it&amp;#39;s very telling that</text>
  <text start="784.55" dur="6.75">whereas we used to import German Irish</text>
  <text start="788.03" dur="4.89">European Western capitalist societies</text>
  <text start="791.3" dur="3.84">that largely had the same kind of</text>
  <text start="792.92" dur="4.53">beliefs and culture that we did and</text>
  <text start="795.14" dur="4.47">least a lot of similarities now we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="797.45" dur="5.15">shifted to South Americans which are</text>
  <text start="799.61" dur="6.24">obviously almost entirely socialist and</text>
  <text start="802.6" dur="5.77">therefore going to vote about 70%</text>
  <text start="805.85" dur="5.52">Democrat although Trump is making a lot</text>
  <text start="808.37" dur="4.56">of progress and changing that he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="811.37" dur="4.92">a lot of things for the Latino and South</text>
  <text start="812.93" dur="5.37">American community even the South</text>
  <text start="816.29" dur="4.41">American community in the United States</text>
  <text start="818.3" dur="5.1">because he&amp;#39;s doing the right things for</text>
  <text start="820.7" dur="4.83">the people and therefore a lot of the</text>

  <text start="854.45" dur="4.14">number of illegal immigrants currently</text>
  <text start="855.71" dur="5.1">in the US I think it&amp;#39;s around 26 million</text>
  <text start="858.59" dur="3.87">or so or more I think Trump while back</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="4.77">actually tweeted out around 25 and a</text>
  <text start="862.46" dur="4.65">half or something as an estimate now he</text>
