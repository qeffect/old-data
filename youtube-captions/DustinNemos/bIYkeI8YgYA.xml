  <text start="174.88" dur="5.82">Ponzi scheme known as Social Security</text>
  <text start="177.72" dur="7.84">all right let me let me emphasize this</text>
  <text start="180.7" dur="8.13">is not the solution is not to continue</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="6.6">to victimize new people in the same damn</text>
  <text start="188.83" dur="5.07">Ponzi scheme all right now this has</text>

  <text start="199.62" dur="3.129">[Music]</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="4">that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me right I</text>

  <text start="209.04" dur="5.64">be stolen from I would rather put my</text>
  <text start="210.9" dur="8.729">money into my child&amp;#39;s future not into</text>
  <text start="214.68" dur="7.08">strangers that that need help you know</text>

  <text start="225.18" dur="5.76">matter how noble the cause is still</text>
  <text start="228.12" dur="6.869">wrong to steal money from Jack to give</text>
  <text start="230.94" dur="7.32">to Jill or whatever right so socialism</text>

  <text start="241.739" dur="5.551">I just cannot afford to pay for it even</text>
  <text start="244.709" dur="4.5">if I wanted to and even if you know all</text>
  <text start="247.29" dur="3.75">Millennials wanted to most Millennials</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="5.131">are assholes anyway but even if all</text>
  <text start="251.04" dur="7.53">Millennials wanted to and conservatives</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="6.119">are the most generous by far and most</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="3.71">Molly hills are not conservatives and so</text>
  <text start="260.459" dur="4.621">they&amp;#39;re probably not going to want to</text>
  <text start="262.28" dur="5.98">there wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough of us to do it</text>
  <text start="265.08" dur="6.48">okay we cannot fix this dying system</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="4.89">right the what&amp;#39;s called the entitlements</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="4.02">right and this is a word that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="4.56">offensive to some older people it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="3.99">that I&amp;#39;m using this word intentionally</text>
  <text start="277.71" dur="3.99">to hurt you this is the word that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.57" dur="4.14">being used because the money that was</text>
  <text start="281.7" dur="4.41">there that you paid in and was promised</text>
  <text start="283.71" dur="6.24">was looted and stolen by the government</text>
  <text start="286.11" dur="6.929">and now you are entitled to this money</text>
  <text start="289.95" dur="4.35">but they don&amp;#39;t have it right and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.039" dur="4.741">why it&amp;#39;s being lumped into the</text>
  <text start="294.3" dur="5.07">entitlement category all right and the</text>
  <text start="297.78" dur="2.94">only thing that they can do is to steal</text>
  <text start="299.37" dur="2.79">money from the rest of us to try to come</text>
  <text start="300.72" dur="3.87">up with more money to pay it and and</text>
  <text start="302.16" dur="5.069">it&amp;#39;s just not gonna work folks you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="304.59" dur="4.949">keep taxing people it&amp;#39;s gone too far we</text>
  <text start="307.229" dur="6">can&amp;#39;t strain any more blood out of the</text>
  <text start="309.539" dur="7.44">turnips okay what Trump is doing is good</text>
  <text start="313.229" dur="5.341">for the economy but still Millennials do</text>
  <text start="316.979" dur="4.12">not have it as easy as you think</text>
  <text start="318.57" dur="5.14">you guys you know</text>
  <text start="321.099" dur="4.71">with with all respect you know the older</text>
  <text start="323.71" dur="5.25">people will say you know when I was your</text>
  <text start="325.809" dur="4.98">age I I did this this and this and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="328.96" dur="3.569">already you know owned a car and blah</text>
  <text start="330.789" dur="3.69">blah well you know when you were our age</text>
  <text start="332.529" dur="6.36">you know you started off and you could</text>
  <text start="334.479" dur="6.39">you could work one man could work put</text>
  <text start="338.889" dur="4.71">himself through school raise a family of</text>
  <text start="340.869" dur="4.32">one year&amp;#39;s salary go to college come out</text>
  <text start="343.599" dur="3.63">debt-free with everything else you know</text>
  <text start="345.189" dur="5.1">my generation goes into this thing in</text>
  <text start="347.229" dur="5.19">debt and never gets out of it okay</text>
  <text start="350.289" dur="3.99">we never even we never even get off the</text>
  <text start="352.419" dur="3.631">launch pad there&amp;#39;s no way we can take</text>
  <text start="354.279" dur="4.17">care of you and then raise families and</text>
  <text start="356.05" dur="6.169">everything else so what we&amp;#39;ll be facing</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="6.06">is a system where the young will just</text>
  <text start="362.219" dur="4.151">it&amp;#39;ll be like Japan the young will be so</text>
  <text start="364.509" dur="3.96">overtaxed that the they will no longer</text>
  <text start="366.37" dur="3.9">have children take trying to take care</text>
  <text start="368.469" dur="3.271">of the older people and the whole</text>
  <text start="370.27" dur="3.66">species will die off where it&amp;#39;s all race</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="3.599">the whole country whatever nation tries</text>
  <text start="373.93" dur="4.17">to do something like that this is kind</text>
  <text start="375.339" dur="4.651">of a Western problem overall I think</text>
  <text start="378.1" dur="4.5">so I wanted to put this out there to</text>
  <text start="379.99" dur="5.52">clarify not to apologize because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="382.6" dur="3.42">think I said I said anything I said</text>
  <text start="385.51" dur="2.64">anything wrong</text>
  <text start="386.02" dur="3.66">obviously even some of my viewers there</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="4.77">this is a touchy subject people get</text>
  <text start="389.68" dur="4.98">offended pretty easily and you know</text>
  <text start="392.92" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s a lot of emotions around this if</text>
  <text start="394.66" dur="3.15">you&amp;#39;ve been stolen from for 30 years on</text>
  <text start="396.67" dur="2.94">a promise that you&amp;#39;re gonna get some of</text>
  <text start="397.81" dur="5.25">it back and you didn&amp;#39;t fight it you know</text>
  <text start="399.61" dur="5.76">30 years later hey by the way there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="403.06" dur="6.45">money you got scammed that would piss</text>
  <text start="405.37" dur="6.81">anyone off right so we can definitely</text>
  <text start="409.51" dur="5.79">think of other solutions you know at the</text>
  <text start="412.18" dur="4.95">end of the day I think I&amp;#39;m a free-market</text>
  <text start="415.3" dur="3.69">capitalist kind of guy I think the</text>
  <text start="417.13" dur="4.56">market will give us the best solutions</text>
  <text start="418.99" dur="4.41">maybe get rid of all these taxes and we</text>
  <text start="421.69" dur="4.89">can all make a lot more money to then</text>
  <text start="423.4" dur="5.52">take care of ourselves in retirement but</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="3.81">by no means do I support theft okay no</text>
  <text start="428.92" dur="3.99">matter how good the cause is I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="430.39" dur="5.31">care if you&amp;#39;re trying to take care of</text>
  <text start="432.91" dur="4.32">old people or feed starving babies if</text>
  <text start="435.7" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;re stealing from people with the</text>
  <text start="437.23" dur="3.24">government is wrong okay and whatever</text>
  <text start="439.66" dur="2.7">you&amp;#39;re gonna do</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="4.08">starving babies for example okay what</text>
  <text start="442.36" dur="4.53">happens with starving babies government</text>
  <text start="444.55" dur="4.89">sends ton of food to Africa saves the</text>
  <text start="446.89" dur="4.35">starving babies went one generation</text>
  <text start="449.44" dur="5.79">later there&amp;#39;s ten times as many starving</text>
  <text start="451.24" dur="5.79">babies okay and you have to keep doing</text>
  <text start="455.23" dur="4.05">it and then it gets worse and worse and</text>
  <text start="457.03" dur="4.92">worse until you pay the price we are</text>
  <text start="459.28" dur="4.62">paying the price in the next decade this</text>
  <text start="461.95" dur="5.43">price has to be paid it&amp;#39;s here we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="463.9" dur="5.7">doing it and that&amp;#39;s not me that&amp;#39;s just</text>
