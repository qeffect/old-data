  <text start="130.259" dur="3.691">Q&amp;#39;s been saying and some of the things</text>
  <text start="132.39" dur="3.78">that that I had the conversation with</text>

  <text start="141.72" dur="4.739">length of time you know this has been my</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="4.92">primary focus with the Q movement since</text>
  <text start="146.459" dur="4.321">the beginning where we go when we do all</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="4.529">not only as a philosophy but more</text>
  <text start="150.78" dur="6.239">recently also as a tactic we pioneered</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="5.191">this with the Q book a phenomenon a red</text>
  <text start="157.019" dur="3.541">pill book for the Matt</text>
  <text start="158.4" dur="5.64">is sort of an art of war for the digital</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="5.039">era but we did that as a team and we</text>
  <text start="164.04" dur="4.38">broke through with just a few of us that</text>
  <text start="165.599" dur="5.101">proof of concept now lends itself to</text>
  <text start="168.42" dur="3.899">everything that we do as a team and if</text>
  <text start="170.7" dur="3.69">12 of us could do that what can a</text>
  <text start="172.319" dur="4.861">hundred of us do against Google what can</text>
  <text start="174.39" dur="5.819">a thousand of us do if we pull together</text>
  <text start="177.18" dur="5.46">and unite and we don&amp;#39;t have to agree on</text>
  <text start="180.209" dur="4.92">everything but we can certainly agree on</text>
  <text start="182.64" dur="5.099">the fact that people should be allowed</text>
  <text start="185.129" dur="4.681">to speak people should have the right to</text>
  <text start="187.739" dur="4.201">say their piece they should have the</text>
  <text start="189.81" dur="4.769">right to make their argument they should</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="4.65">not be censored they should not be cut</text>
  <text start="194.579" dur="4.171">out they should not be punished for</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="4.92">exercising therefore the right to an</text>
  <text start="198.75" dur="4.56">opinion that is what free will and free</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="5.009">speech and the First Amendment of this</text>
  <text start="203.31" dur="5.64">country was all about now together we</text>
  <text start="206.519" dur="7.261">are strong and he says join me</text>
