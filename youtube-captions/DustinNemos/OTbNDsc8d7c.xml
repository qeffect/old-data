  <text start="9.78" dur="6.029">about something scammy something that</text>
  <text start="13.019" dur="5.461">didn&amp;#39;t quite make me feel very</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="5.431">comfortable within the c60 industry</text>
  <text start="18.48" dur="6.93">obviously there&amp;#39;s a huge demand for this</text>
  <text start="21.24" dur="7.109">a very exciting new material the supply</text>
  <text start="25.41" dur="6">has not even begun to catch up and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="28.349" dur="4.62">basically out until December the raw</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="6.87">material everyone that&amp;#39;s making it is</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="8.331">virtually sold out the the excitement</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="5.4">around this has also created a lot of</text>
  <text start="41.3" dur="4.81">scammy things going on people are</text>
  <text start="43.68" dur="4.68">selling wood ash and activated charcoal</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="5.4">at c60 prices pretending that it&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="48.36" dur="4.56">sort of natural natural source of c60</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="4.319">and there&amp;#39;s no evidence to support that</text>
  <text start="52.92" dur="4.92">that I&amp;#39;ve seen and I&amp;#39;ve looked but</text>
  <text start="55.829" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re doing it anyway and I could I</text>
  <text start="57.84" dur="3.899">could almost forgive you know ignorant</text>
  <text start="60.239" dur="3.691">lis marketing something like that</text>
  <text start="61.739" dur="5.191">thinking it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the like the organic</text>
  <text start="63.93" dur="5.88">option or something like that but if</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="6.09">they at least believe it right something</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="5.94">crossed my desk today that is disturbing</text>
  <text start="73.02" dur="5.88">all right and and there are other people</text>
  <text start="75.75" dur="4.49">maybe that you know that first batch</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;re the people selling those things</text>
  <text start="80.24" dur="3.94">okay maybe they believe it but this</text>
  <text start="82.259" dur="4.5">batch these are the people that are</text>
  <text start="84.18" dur="5.7">selling just oil it doesn&amp;#39;t even have</text>
  <text start="86.759" dur="5.881">c60 in it I&amp;#39;ve come across a company</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="5.22">called nano shell in the UK that sold me</text>
  <text start="92.64" dur="4.86">something that was not c60 and I I had</text>
  <text start="95.1" dur="3.93">to dump out litres of oil and I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="2.79">waiting to get a refund on this stuff</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="2.85">don&amp;#39;t even know if they&amp;#39;re gonna give me</text>
  <text start="100.29" dur="5.039">a refund</text>
  <text start="101.88" dur="5.82">I would definitely avoid purchasing you</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="6.481">know c60 powder from nano shell and the</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="6">UK and and when I asked them about you</text>
  <text start="111.81" dur="5.82">know please quit lying to me about these</text>
  <text start="113.7" dur="6.419">things because just a dozen lies they</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="5.309">can&amp;#39;t snarky with me and we&amp;#39;re very rude</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="5">and condescending so customer service</text>
  <text start="122.939" dur="4.951">was not their strong point either but</text>
  <text start="125.119" dur="4.36">there are different folks out there who</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="3.63">are actually taking advantage of people</text>
  <text start="129.479" dur="3.331">and scamming and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="1.84">for the industry that&amp;#39;s not good for the</text>
  <text start="132.81" dur="2.82">customer</text>
  <text start="133.36" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s not good for anyone out there so</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="5.77">you know I have a unique position in</text>
  <text start="138.04" dur="5.61">that I am not only a producer c60 but</text>
  <text start="141.4" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;m also in the alt media so I can I can</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="3.78">call attention to things like this that</text>
  <text start="145.21" dur="5.28">need attention brought to them so people</text>
  <text start="147.43" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t get taken advantage of today I had</text>
  <text start="150.49" dur="3.27">somebody contact me I&amp;#39;m gonna read you a</text>
  <text start="152.05" dur="3.69">little bit of email I&amp;#39;m not gonna name</text>
  <text start="153.76" dur="4.05">the company but I&amp;#39;m gonna give you the</text>
  <text start="155.74" dur="6.27">tools that you need to spot this</text>
  <text start="157.81" dur="7.35">particular in my opinion scam so they</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="4.949">reached out to me and said base they had</text>
  <text start="165.16" dur="4.65">heard that I was looking for c60 somehow</text>
  <text start="166.959" dur="5.371">and and they wanted to tell me about</text>
  <text start="169.81" dur="5.16">their product and they said quote I have</text>
  <text start="172.33" dur="6.09">super fullerene far greater an order of</text>
  <text start="174.97" dur="6.239">magnitude more absorbable than c63 50</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="6.39">gram check out our sales site blah blah</text>
  <text start="181.209" dur="5.401">blah and you know they say manga and</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="4.26">everything else okay maybe they&amp;#39;re pro</text>
  <text start="186.61" dur="4.92">matter I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m not gonna give</text>
  <text start="189.07" dur="4.56">out their name but I&amp;#39;m gonna give you my</text>
  <text start="191.53" dur="5.04">opinion as to what is going on here</text>
  <text start="193.63" dur="5.25">and why a super fullerene is is made-up</text>
  <text start="196.57" dur="6.419">malarkey</text>
  <text start="198.88" dur="8.82">they tell me they have you know 50</text>
  <text start="202.989" dur="6">gallons ready to go they give me their</text>
  <text start="207.7" dur="8.43">personal experience I&amp;#39;ve been taking</text>
  <text start="208.989" dur="9.421">this for two years it&amp;#39;s great they let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.13" dur="3.93">see I asked basically for evidence to</text>
  <text start="218.41" dur="3.24">support the claim I say looking at your</text>
  <text start="220.06" dur="5.1">page you act as if your product is</text>
  <text start="221.65" dur="5.52">different from carbon 60 and yet the</text>
  <text start="225.16" dur="4.67">studies that you cite our carbon 60 so</text>
  <text start="227.17" dur="5.37">they cite the longevity study for rats</text>
  <text start="229.83" dur="5.65">for their product which they&amp;#39;re clearly</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="4.919">saying is far superior and completely</text>
  <text start="235.48" dur="3.539">different than carbon 60 which was a</text>
  <text start="237.459" dur="3.78">little bit weird for me anyway and I</text>
  <text start="239.019" dur="4.261">asked them about that and they said we</text>
  <text start="241.239" dur="3.511">only mentioned C 60 because it is the</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="3.33">material with which the consumer</text>
  <text start="244.75" dur="3.75">marketplace is familiar as you know</text>
  <text start="246.61" dur="3.3">carbon fullerenes and olive oil are a</text>
  <text start="248.5" dur="3.63">relatively new product to the</text>
  <text start="249.91" dur="4.38">marketplace over the past over the last</text>
  <text start="252.13" dur="4.65">three to five years it is a niche</text>
  <text start="254.29" dur="4.47">product load up for about three days and</text>
  <text start="256.78" dur="3.299">you will be amazed I have known the</text>
  <text start="258.76" dur="2.969">manufacturing principles from</text>
  <text start="260.079" dur="3.451">professional relationships over the last</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="4.351">30 years I trust their manufacturing</text>
  <text start="263.53" dur="3.72">processes and procedures universities</text>
  <text start="266.08" dur="3.93">are using our</text>
  <text start="267.25" dur="5.97">to protect in myocardial infarction</text>
  <text start="270.01" dur="4.98">studies an atrial fibrillation stem cell</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="3.72">and other research studies I am not at</text>
  <text start="274.99" dur="3.24">liberty to Rivet reveal the universities</text>
  <text start="276.94" dur="2.82">but I assure you everyone at the</text>
  <text start="278.23" dur="5.16">university level is looking for ways to</text>
  <text start="279.76" dur="5.1">step up on our patents the evidence is</text>
  <text start="283.39" dur="3.69">in the patents and in the product you</text>
  <text start="284.86" dur="5.67">have to try it to compare you will see</text>
  <text start="287.08" dur="5.49">there is no comparison okay so one</text>
  <text start="290.53" dur="5.79">carbon sixty is not to my knowledge</text>
  <text start="292.57" dur="5.82">patented - there there again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.32" dur="3.98">citing studies for C 60 and saying that</text>
  <text start="298.39" dur="4.08">they have something different from C 60</text>
  <text start="300.3" dur="3.79">I&amp;#39;ve never heard of anything called a</text>
  <text start="302.47" dur="3.6">super fullerene before I mean I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="304.09" dur="3.78">of C 70 and there&amp;#39;s even there&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="306.07" dur="4.65">higher levels up there in the 300s or</text>
  <text start="307.87" dur="6.03">400s that are fascinating but incredibly</text>
  <text start="310.72" dur="4.77">expensive to make and of course by so I</text>
  <text start="313.9" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t even I don&amp;#39;t even mess with as</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="4.679">some people will also sell C 70 and</text>
  <text start="317.41" dur="4.17">there&amp;#39;s less research behind it it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="320.169" dur="3.211">little bit more effective and possibly</text>
  <text start="321.58" dur="4.53">kind of an energy boost on top of what C</text>
  <text start="323.38" dur="4.05">60 does but it&amp;#39;s the markets not quite</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="5.16">there yet we need more research in that</text>
  <text start="327.43" dur="5.85">area I think and you know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="331.27" dur="3.59">reading over their website they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="333.28" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re gonna have this really sleep</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="3.82">beautiful website by the way really</text>
  <text start="337.03" dur="4.01">slick marketing page as to why their</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="4.53">product is different or better than C 60</text>
  <text start="341.04" dur="4.57">but when I asked for evidence when I</text>
  <text start="343.21" dur="5.1">asked for sources and on their website</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="5.07">itself it has just a rat study for C 60</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="3.51">which if you&amp;#39;re not selling C 60 you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="350.68" dur="4.28">selling something better than why are</text>
  <text start="351.82" dur="6.21">you citing the study for C 60 however</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="5.23">the universities are a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="358.03" dur="3.6">like you know publicly funded public</text>
  <text start="360.19" dur="3.9">information kind of stuff I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not an expert here but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="364.09" dur="4.65">know why he would not be at liberty to</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="5.16">reveal universities my first instinct</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="3.81">here is this stinks you&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="370.81" dur="3.87">telling me I have to try it to see to</text>
  <text start="372.55" dur="5.07">believe it it&amp;#39;s way better than what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.68" dur="4.92">out there which is C 60 the only</text>
  <text start="377.62" dur="5.52">evidence that you have is a citation of</text>
  <text start="379.6" dur="5.16">a study for C 60 and you know everyone</text>
  <text start="383.14" dur="3.839">loves it everybody is using it but I</text>
  <text start="384.76" dur="7.469">can&amp;#39;t tell you who they are</text>
  <text start="386.979" dur="8.281">this feels slimy to me I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="392.229" dur="5.341">could be off the mark here I&amp;#39;m open to</text>
  <text start="395.26" dur="3.33">being proven wrong about this but I just</text>
  <text start="397.57" dur="4.03">don&amp;#39;t want to see people taking</text>
  <text start="398.59" dur="5.53">advantage of by some slick marketing</text>
  <text start="401.6" dur="3.99">I basically responded and said the</text>
  <text start="404.12" dur="3.45">evidence is in the documents and the</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="3.69">studies tank your scam elsewhere don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="407.57" dur="4.08">give me C 6 D passed us something</text>
  <text start="409.28" dur="4.44">different and site C 60 studies to</text>
  <text start="411.65" dur="3.93">justify something that isn&amp;#39;t C 60 and</text>
  <text start="413.72" dur="3.93">then tell me everyone loves it but I</text>
  <text start="415.58" dur="4.98">can&amp;#39;t tell you who they are people</text>
  <text start="417.65" dur="7.28">actually buy this scam anyway that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="420.56" dur="4.37">that&amp;#39;s it was really weird</text>
  <text start="425.11" dur="4.87">they&amp;#39;re basically just adding the word</text>
  <text start="427.31" dur="6.87">super to it and then and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.98" dur="6.09">it so you know the price is high but the</text>
  <text start="434.18" dur="4.53">price of all the C 60 is gonna go up I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="436.07" dur="4.35">not really against that because right</text>
  <text start="438.71" dur="3.72">now you can&amp;#39;t even get it you know so</text>
  <text start="440.42" dur="5.58">having it expensive is better than not</text>
  <text start="442.43" dur="5.55">having it at all I guess but you know</text>
  <text start="446" dur="6.23">maybe they have some in stock but on the</text>
  <text start="447.98" dur="8.13">other hand this just screams you know</text>
  <text start="452.23" dur="6.31">sly or I don&amp;#39;t know I didn&amp;#39;t get a good</text>
  <text start="456.11" dur="4.05">impression from this obviously I asked</text>
  <text start="458.54" dur="3.09">for studies I asked for citations I</text>
  <text start="460.16" dur="4.26">didn&amp;#39;t get any patent links all I got</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="6.39">was this one link on their website to</text>
  <text start="464.42" dur="5.91">the rat study beautiful website like I</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="4.59">said if you come across this you come</text>
  <text start="470.33" dur="4.11">across the term super fullerenes just</text>
  <text start="472.61" dur="4.64">make sure you do your homework I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="474.44" dur="5.13">little bit worried about this because</text>
  <text start="477.25" dur="4.81">when people start getting scamming out</text>
  <text start="479.57" dur="4.56">there it makes the whole industry look</text>
  <text start="482.06" dur="5.1">bad and obviously as somebody else who</text>
  <text start="484.13" dur="5.49">produces c60 I don&amp;#39;t like it but I just</text>
  <text start="487.16" dur="3.9">want to let you guys know everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="489.62" dur="4.01">looking for it so if you&amp;#39;re out there</text>
  <text start="491.06" dur="5.85">hunting and you&amp;#39;re trying to find it</text>
  <text start="493.63" dur="4.75">beware because most of us who have it</text>
  <text start="496.91" dur="4.23">are selling out at least of the grams</text>
  <text start="498.38" dur="3.99">and the palate or the raw material you</text>
  <text start="501.14" dur="4.11">know some of us still have some a little</text>
  <text start="502.37" dur="5.37">stock I have some oil stock still it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="508.94" dur="5.25">much other people have stocked but I</text>
  <text start="510.8" dur="4.83">will say that this kind of thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="514.19" dur="4.83">not gonna help the industry it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="4.95">probably end up with people getting a</text>
  <text start="519.02" dur="4.59">bad impression things like that if</text>
  <text start="520.58" dur="5.37">people are selling activated charcoal</text>
  <text start="523.61" dur="5.07">you can buy that if you can actually see</text>

  <text start="547.18" dur="2.88">burnt wood you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="4.529">be paying it for ash either actually is</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="4.41">great for other things but it&amp;#39;s not C 60</text>
  <text start="553.149" dur="4.081">you&amp;#39;re not gonna get the kind of effects</text>
  <text start="554.47" dur="5.94">C 60 the research shows that it can do</text>
