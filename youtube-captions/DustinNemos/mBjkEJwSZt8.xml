  <text start="10.43" dur="5.96">back by the most powerful force</text>
  <text start="29.11" dur="5.199">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="31.82" dur="4.919">Emo&amp;#39;s of the nemo&amp;#39;s news network and</text>
  <text start="34.309" dur="4.231">before we dive into the news I just want</text>
  <text start="36.739" dur="4.411">to briefly kind of recap the rally I</text>
  <text start="38.54" dur="4.44">just got home late last night kind of</text>
  <text start="41.15" dur="4.979">honestly went to bed early after the</text>
  <text start="42.98" dur="5.13">live chat it was a long long trip it was</text>
  <text start="46.129" dur="3.811">a great trip I mean it had I had</text>
  <text start="48.11" dur="3.24">personally some mixed feelings because I</text>
  <text start="49.94" dur="3.84">stopped in North Carolina to see some</text>
  <text start="51.35" dur="5.22">family and and my family is not doing so</text>
  <text start="53.78" dur="5.31">well but beyond that the trip itself was</text>
  <text start="56.57" dur="4.5">great and at least I got to see them and</text>
  <text start="59.09" dur="4.379">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really cool too so the</text>
  <text start="61.07" dur="3.9">trip itself was I would say very</text>
  <text start="63.469" dur="3.721">productive of course the mainstream</text>
  <text start="64.97" dur="3.72">media showed up to attack it sorry I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="67.19" dur="3.179">white with my screen off they they</text>
  <text start="68.69" dur="3.87">showed up to attack it and they tried to</text>
  <text start="70.369" dur="4.201">demonize it they tried to make us look</text>
  <text start="72.56" dur="4.35">like crazy violent lunatics they tried</text>
  <text start="74.57" dur="3.57">to attack you know just the usual games</text>
  <text start="76.91" dur="3.81">that they play of sophistry</text>
  <text start="78.14" dur="5.339">we even had Jeb Bush chime in and call</text>
  <text start="80.72" dur="4.289">Dylan disgusting because we were talking</text>
  <text start="83.479" dur="5.25">about some 9/11 truth at this rally</text>
  <text start="85.009" dur="5.191">because hey it was on 9/11 and we were</text>
  <text start="88.729" dur="3.451">parked right in front</text>
  <text start="90.2" dur="4.65">direct line of you to the White House</text>
  <text start="92.18" dur="4.68">itself so it was a great rally it was</text>
  <text start="94.85" dur="6.03">really good it was hot there was no</text>
  <text start="96.86" dur="6.06">shade whatsoever and it was a lesson</text>
  <text start="100.88" dur="4.68">learned but I take comfort in the fact</text>
  <text start="102.92" dur="4.08">that you know all of those will Sumner</text>
  <text start="105.56" dur="2.849">types out there that we&amp;#39;re sort of</text>
  <text start="107" dur="3.42">trying to make us look bad we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="108.409" dur="5.401">sweating to death just like the rest of</text>
  <text start="110.42" dur="5.82">us anyway so without you know too much</text>

  <text start="205.56" dur="5.13">all right so let&amp;#39;s dive right in so here</text>
  <text start="209.88" dur="4.92">we go</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="6.299">I want to cover this this is where</text>
  <text start="214.8" dur="5.4">general Flynn is finally kind of taken</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="4.921">back or taken the offensive we know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="220.2" dur="4.5">the general Flynn Defense Fund and it is</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="5.46">defense but you know after all this time</text>
  <text start="224.7" dur="5.37">of waiting around for justice to be</text>
  <text start="227.37" dur="4.56">served finally it seems like the</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="3.87">strategy is unveiling itself you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="3.809">mess with general Flynn</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="4.44">and now he finally is gonna go on the</text>
  <text start="235.739" dur="4.921">offensive or or you know counter-attack</text>
  <text start="238.38" dur="4.169">if you will so that&amp;#39;s why I jokingly</text>
  <text start="240.66" dur="4.25">sometimes call it the the general Flynn</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="4.531">offense fund which I think would be</text>
  <text start="244.91" dur="3.88">really cool I think they would link</text>
  <text start="247.08" dur="4.409">triple their donations if they if they</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="5.85">called it that because people love</text>
  <text start="251.489" dur="6.12">general Fleming he&amp;#39;s a national hero but</text>
  <text start="254.64" dur="5.46">they&amp;#39;re so tired of defending and</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="4.711">defending and defending and they want to</text>
  <text start="260.1" dur="4.47">see some attacking and and that means</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="4.11">justice that means you know let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="264.57" dur="3.93">some of these guys like McKay he brought</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="4.049">to the courts let&amp;#39;s see them on the hot</text>
  <text start="268.5" dur="4.11">seat for potential time behind bars</text>
  <text start="270.479" dur="3.241">let&amp;#39;s see them up there for the crimes</text>
  <text start="272.61" dur="2.97">that they&amp;#39;ve committed but they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="273.72" dur="4.68">on the Left right that&amp;#39;s not how it</text>
  <text start="275.58" dur="5.94">works so we have Flynn attorney Sidney</text>
  <text start="278.4" dur="5.79">Powell who&amp;#39;s like a big-shot celebrity</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="4.11">in her own right actually I already knew</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="3.9">who she was before I&amp;#39;d ever heard of</text>
  <text start="285.63" dur="4.499">general Flynn let&amp;#39;s put it that way she</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="3.299">requests the Brady material to prove</text>
  <text start="290.129" dur="3.391">that the feds are withholding evidence</text>
  <text start="291.389" dur="4.29">she&amp;#39;s basically saying you guys are not</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="4.019">only withholding evidence that proves</text>
  <text start="295.679" dur="4.98">that what you&amp;#39;re doing is is a lie in</text>
  <text start="297.539" dur="6.21">false but you&amp;#39;re targeting a national</text>
  <text start="300.659" dur="4.77">hero a patriot a general of the United</text>
  <text start="303.749" dur="2.79">States to do so you&amp;#39;re trying to bring</text>
  <text start="305.429" dur="3.42">him down so that you can get to</text>
  <text start="306.539" dur="4.23">President Trump and that&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="308.849" dur="3.36">happen that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re saying here</text>
  <text start="310.769" dur="3.87">and there they&amp;#39;re basically standing up</text>
  <text start="312.209" dur="4.02">and it&amp;#39;s a big fight and they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="314.639" dur="3.33">to avoid giving these documents the</text>
  <text start="316.229" dur="3.09">courts already ruled so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.969" dur="3.331">getting there</text>
  <text start="319.319" dur="3.93">and I&amp;#39;ll read a little bit of it here</text>
  <text start="321.3" dur="4.199">retired Army General Flint a Michael</text>
  <text start="323.249" dur="4.02">Flynn is picking up where Republicans</text>
  <text start="325.499" dur="4.59">left off last year&amp;#39;s he tries to turn</text>
  <text start="327.269" dur="6.21">the FBI inside out to find new evidence</text>
  <text start="330.089" dur="5.34">the House GOP in 2017 and 18 launched an</text>
  <text start="333.479" dur="4.5">aggressive investigation into decisions</text>
  <text start="335.429" dur="4.5">by the Barack Obama administration to</text>
  <text start="337.979" dur="4.14">put the FBI&amp;#39;s Russia probe squarely on</text>
  <text start="339.929" dur="4.02">President Trump and his colleagues we</text>
  <text start="342.119" dur="3.21">know what really happened there had</text>
  <text start="343.949" dur="3.72">nothing to do with President Trump the</text>
  <text start="345.329" dur="5.16">actual Kalu ters were of course Hillary</text>
  <text start="347.669" dur="4.2">Clinton but and we actually have her</text>
  <text start="350.489" dur="3.6">working with Russian oligarchs to get</text>
  <text start="351.869" dur="5.28">this evidence and into evidence I call</text>
  <text start="354.089" dur="5.1">it you know very very usually I use the</text>
  <text start="357.149" dur="4.47">term very loosely in this in this</text>
  <text start="359.189" dur="4.801">instance but they worked to create this</text>
  <text start="361.619" dur="5.55">evidence on everything from Russian</text>
  <text start="363.99" dur="5.729">hookers and PPK to the fact that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="367.169" dur="4.71">trying to link him to Russia with like</text>
  <text start="369.719" dur="4.32">business deals and the Trump Tower in</text>
  <text start="371.879" dur="5.43">Russia which never happened and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.039" dur="5.43">just it&amp;#39;s nonsensical it really is but</text>
  <text start="377.309" dur="4.41">they were desperate and why were they so</text>
  <text start="379.469" dur="4.141">desperate why did they pull out this</text>
  <text start="381.719" dur="4.68">like big lie theory to try to go after</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="4.559">not only Trump but everyone around him</text>
  <text start="386.399" dur="3.72">including general flown who&amp;#39;s now in</text>
  <text start="388.169" dur="5.64">this situation where he&amp;#39;s either got it</text>
  <text start="390.119" dur="7.41">like go down for Trump or take out Trump</text>
  <text start="393.809" dur="5.67">with him or fight and win and I think</text>
  <text start="397.529" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s exactly the path that he plans to</text>
  <text start="399.479" dur="4.23">take so we&amp;#39;re getting very close now</text>
  <text start="401.879" dur="3.45">Flint&amp;#39;s new attorney Sydney Powell has</text>
  <text start="403.709" dur="4.71">filed court motions to try to unearth</text>
  <text start="405.329" dur="4.83">documents on how the FBI pursued not</text>
  <text start="408.419" dur="3.87">just the former general but the Trump</text>

  <text start="519.26" dur="4.01">on the educational system it was a great</text>
  <text start="520.909" dur="5.191">conversation was very enlightening</text>
