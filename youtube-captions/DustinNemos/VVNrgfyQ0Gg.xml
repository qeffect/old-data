  <text start="2.639" dur="5.01">change welcome back my friends this is</text>
  <text start="5.22" dur="5.28">destiny most of destiny most calm and</text>
  <text start="7.649" dur="4.711">this is going to be one of my favorite</text>
  <text start="10.5" dur="3.9">topics to talk about because I actually</text>
  <text start="12.36" dur="5.04">really enjoy triggering people about</text>
  <text start="14.4" dur="5.1">this topic I&amp;#39;m so tired of people who</text>
  <text start="17.4" dur="4.74">are trying to push the climate alarmism</text>
  <text start="19.5" dur="5.1">on me and push this idea that we have to</text>
  <text start="22.14" dur="4.62">make all of these insane sacrifices to</text>
  <text start="24.6" dur="5.22">our standards of living and give up so</text>
  <text start="26.76" dur="13.17">much power to evil tyrants all in the</text>
  <text start="29.82" dur="12.09">name of that&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="39.93" dur="3.93">that happens a lot lately actually I</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="3.989">don&amp;#39;t get it I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="43.86" dur="5.01">on with that printer but anyway I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="45.899" dur="5.011">like printers so they&amp;#39;re always trying</text>
  <text start="48.87" dur="3.66">to like just push this down our throats</text>
  <text start="50.91" dur="3.629">and try to steal more money from us and</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="3.57">tax more of us and they just want to</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="3.54">make us feel like crap and like complete</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="4.77">jerks and even get us fired from our</text>
  <text start="58.079" dur="5.011">jobs or or or attack us physically if we</text>
  <text start="60.87" dur="3.99">disagree with them about this issue but</text>
  <text start="63.09" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s just like all of the other crazy</text>
  <text start="64.86" dur="4.86">issues that that the left believes in in</text>
  <text start="67.17" dur="3.6">today&amp;#39;s world and to be very clear let</text>
  <text start="69.72" dur="5.1">me go through some of them</text>
  <text start="70.77" dur="6.389">one infanticide to 70% marginal tax</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="5.76">rates three open borders for sanctuary</text>
  <text start="77.159" dur="6.21">cities five capitalism is irredeemable</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="6.57">or just evil in some way and six</text>
  <text start="83.369" dur="5.941">slashing our military budget so this is</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="5.609">kind of the modern laughs now that is</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="6.93">where we are in terms of this now what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="6.601">happened recently very interestingly is</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="5.82">that Trump has put together a panel to</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="5.7">reinvestigate the issue and he&amp;#39;s brought</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="5.879">together some pretty big names that are</text>
  <text start="105.06" dur="5.519">kind of scaring the whole you know</text>
  <text start="107.939" dur="5.521">global alarmism the global the global</text>
  <text start="110.579" dur="4.5">climate chaos Brigade you know those</text>
  <text start="113.46" dur="4.019">folks that just won&amp;#39;t stop talking about</text>
  <text start="115.079" dur="4.86">how it&amp;#39;s the end of the world in 12 days</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="4.5">if we don&amp;#39;t 12 years or whatever if we</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="4.981">don&amp;#39;t do something now and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="121.979" dur="5.51">saying it for four decades global</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="6.149">cooling global freezing global warming</text>
  <text start="127.489" dur="5.201">just get off our backs and quit actually</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="4.381">destroying the environment</text>
  <text start="132.69" dur="4.41">in the name of government debt because</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re actually dealing with some serious</text>
  <text start="137.1" dur="4.8">environmental issues but not global</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="5.52">warming that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s actually not one</text>
  <text start="141.9" dur="7.65">of them so one of the scientists is name</text>
  <text start="145.89" dur="5.55">is dr. William hopper and Princeton</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="3.62">University physicist and national</text>
  <text start="151.44" dur="5.25">security adviser so that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="153.17" dur="5.86">he was selected to lead the Commission</text>
  <text start="156.69" dur="4.65">and they&amp;#39;re going to go and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="3.63">gonna dig back into this but frankly I</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="3.09">already know what they&amp;#39;re gonna find the</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="3.93">science is already you know well</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="5.46">established that co2 is actually great</text>
  <text start="166.59" dur="5.04">for the planet and as he as he also says</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="3.57">he says co2 will be good for the earth</text>
  <text start="171.63" dur="5.7">and this is what he told the new</text>
  <text start="173.46" dur="5.64">American magazine at a 2016 climate</text>
  <text start="177.33" dur="3.63">conference in Phoenix Arizona that</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="4.68">brought together leading scientists and</text>
  <text start="180.96" dur="4.29">experts in various fields to expose the</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="6.18">lies and alarmism</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="6.51">so you know the research is is quite</text>
  <text start="189.96" dur="3.69">strong in this area there&amp;#39;s no such</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="4.26">thing as settled science that no matter</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="4.26">what they ask you to believe no they do</text>
  <text start="196.02" dur="4.65">not have a majority of scientists and</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="4.71">consensus on this issue that was in PR</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="3.9">and marketing gambit and it worked on</text>
  <text start="202.62" dur="5.25">the dull the dull and the people who</text>
  <text start="204.57" dur="4.71">didn&amp;#39;t research it but that&amp;#39;s it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="3.3">no actual research to back it up</text>
  <text start="209.28" dur="3.69">although billionaires have been made on</text>
  <text start="211.17" dur="4.02">it and governments certainly have</text>
  <text start="212.97" dur="4.71">incentive to go along with it so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="6.87">kind of where we are at the moment and I</text>
  <text start="217.68" dur="6.63">also wanted to to bring this up carbon</text>
  <text start="222.06" dur="4.17">dioxide is the real Green Deal says</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="4.08">climate expert because yeah basically</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="4.229">what it leads to is a greener richer</text>
  <text start="228.39" dur="5.19">earth with more plant life and therefore</text>
  <text start="230.459" dur="6.181">more oxygen and good things for us and</text>
  <text start="233.58" dur="6.24">more food and just a more lush planet in</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="6.27">general more abundance for all so that</text>
  <text start="239.82" dur="4.949">would not be a bad thing I mean most of</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.54">the planet is unbearably like you know a</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="3.961">large part of the planet is unbearably</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="4.17">cold so you know we would open up a lot</text>
  <text start="248.73" dur="4.259">of real estate as well for people maybe</text>
  <text start="250.62" dur="4.38">ease some of the pressure who knows if</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="4.081">it actually got warmer but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="255" dur="4.62">actually getting warmer it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="3.96">getting cooler and mankind doesn&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="259.62" dur="4.84">to have much to do with it at all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.03" dur="6.699">more the Sun and the sun&amp;#39;s natural just</text>
  <text start="264.46" dur="4.98">in general you know fluctuations that it</text>
  <text start="267.729" dur="4.171">does about every 30 years or so it goes</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="5.52">through cycles we&amp;#39;re in a particularly</text>
  <text start="271.9" dur="4.41">cool spot the planet is cooling but very</text>
  <text start="274.96" dur="3.03">slowly not a big deal</text>
  <text start="276.31" dur="2.82">it&amp;#39;s gonna warm up again the next time</text>
  <text start="277.99" dur="2.82">the Sun does it and they&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="279.13" dur="4.65">gonna try to scream it again on the next</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="6.96">generation but for now I think we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="6.5">this stupid idea beat and it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="287.77" dur="4.649">matter of time and many screeching</text>
  <text start="290.28" dur="4.479">liberals that they have to we have to</text>
  <text start="292.419" dur="4.68">pry them off this idea and their fingers</text>
  <text start="294.759" dur="4.561">around our wallets and throats</text>
  <text start="297.099" dur="5.721">Dustin Deimos out and I hope you guys</text>
  <text start="299.32" dur="3.5">enjoy get your popcorn ready</text>
