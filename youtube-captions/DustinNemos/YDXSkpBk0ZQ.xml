  <text start="367.44" dur="7.28">I was in high school and trust me I over</text>
  <text start="369.69" dur="8.75">that pretty quickly I was old man by 24</text>
  <text start="374.72" dur="6.34">but basically I spent my entire life</text>
  <text start="378.44" dur="4.87">digging into these rabbit holes digging</text>
  <text start="381.06" dur="3.81">into these topics I&amp;#39;ve been down almost</text>
  <text start="383.31" dur="3.3">every single one of them there&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="384.87" dur="3.54">nothing out there that I haven&amp;#39;t at</text>
  <text start="386.61" dur="6.63">least encountered in some form or</text>

  <text start="403.06" dur="5.55">you know folklore mythology that kind of</text>
  <text start="405.4" dur="4.739">stuff involved so for me it was a schism</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="4.589">right I was just trying to escape from</text>
  <text start="410.139" dur="6">the pain of this nihilus life that I was</text>
  <text start="413.199" dur="4.171">living because I saw all that stuff and</text>
  <text start="416.139" dur="3.721">I was a young kid I didn&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="417.37" dur="4.769">deal with that that set me on a very</text>
  <text start="419.86" dur="5.309">dark journey for most of my life I mean</text>
  <text start="422.139" dur="5.761">I had to go very introspective I had to</text>
  <text start="425.169" dur="5.881">overcome depression and nihilism and</text>
  <text start="427.9" dur="4.98">then and escapism and hedonism and all</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="4.35">of these things that that I was led down</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="4.469">that path because of these these very</text>
  <text start="435.4" dur="6.47">deep and complicated issues that fake</text>
  <text start="437.349" dur="7.171">society in a very undeveloped mind I</text>
