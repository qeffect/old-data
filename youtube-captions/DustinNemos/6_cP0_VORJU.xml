  <text start="571.77" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s where most Christians operate and</text>
  <text start="573.66" dur="4.08">in patriots getting the government a</text>
  <text start="575.13" dur="4.65">little bit a lot more than this if</text>
  <text start="577.74" dur="4.38">non-christian Patriots right do a lot in</text>
  <text start="579.78" dur="4.11">government but the top bottom three is</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="4.11">where they took over the culture it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="583.89" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s academia so they control the</text>
  <text start="586.23" dur="5.37">mind through going on schools and then</text>
  <text start="588.33" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s the arts and entertainment yeah</text>
  <text start="591.6" dur="6.57">world right and then obviously the media</text>
  <text start="593.97" dur="5.76">right so so did I say that twice dad</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="3.42">can&amp;#39;t memorize that but if you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="599.73" dur="4.86">them yeah no I know I didn&amp;#39;t so media</text>
  <text start="601.59" dur="5.31">arts the media yeah yeah so they reason</text>
  <text start="604.59" dur="4.53">I use the mountain it&amp;#39;s not anything to</text>
  <text start="606.9" dur="4.8">do with Dominion theology or the 7em</text>
  <text start="609.12" dur="3.9">movement that some people believe in</text>
  <text start="611.7" dur="2.67">some people don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not I just use it</text>
  <text start="613.02" dur="2.55">for cat organization because what they</text>
  <text start="614.37" dur="4.86">did is they just went and took over the</text>
  <text start="615.57" dur="6.03">top three percent and a good example is</text>
  <text start="619.23" dur="3.96">they took over all like JP Morgan and</text>
  <text start="621.6" dur="4.17">the media just went and got the 25 top</text>
  <text start="623.19" dur="3.66">newspapers the top three to five percent</text>
  <text start="625.77" dur="2.61">of newspapers right</text>
  <text start="626.85" dur="3.66">and then he they ended up being able to</text>
  <text start="628.38" dur="4.86">dominate all of the media Mountain and</text>
  <text start="630.51" dur="4.17">then you see what they did in arts and</text>
  <text start="633.24" dur="4.16">entertainment they went and got all the</text>
  <text start="634.68" dur="6.87">elites sport athletes and all the elite</text>
  <text start="637.4" dur="6.43">the popular of the popular stars on the</text>
  <text start="641.55" dur="5.01">movies and then boom they owned the</text>
  <text start="643.83" dur="4.77">whole mountain and then you look at the</text>
  <text start="646.56" dur="4.86">same with the progressives that own all</text>
  <text start="648.6" dur="4.56">the tenured positions and colleges they</text>
  <text start="651.42" dur="4.92">get those top people and they all listen</text>
  <text start="653.16" dur="5.34">old akka date all really quickly sorry</text>
  <text start="656.34" dur="4.53">we had a interruption from some sort of</text>
  <text start="658.5" dur="4.05">an audio bug on my end but yeah we were</text>
  <text start="660.87" dur="3.75">talking about stop at burning and and</text>
  <text start="662.55" dur="4.59">yeah censorship has become a serious</text>
  <text start="664.62" dur="3.93">issue and and you&amp;#39;re right we have all</text>
  <text start="667.14" dur="3.05">these mountains that we do need to climb</text>
  <text start="668.55" dur="3.78">certainly and it makes absolute sense</text>
  <text start="670.19" dur="2.59">every one of those issues has to be</text>
  <text start="672.33" dur="2.61">addressed</text>
  <text start="672.78" dur="3.42">simultaneously yeah it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="3.24">interesting if you look at some of the</text>
  <text start="676.2" dur="5.27">studies on the latest uh D I saw about</text>
  <text start="678.18" dur="7.32">belief in God ninety three percent of</text>
  <text start="681.47" dur="6.76">Americans believe in God right but seven</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="5.72">percent that top seven percent controls</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="4.52">ninety eight percent of the media that</text>
  <text start="691.22" dur="3.69">top cell</text>
  <text start="692.75" dur="3.8">percent I mean I only only two percent</text>
  <text start="694.91" dur="4.83">of the media actually believe in God</text>
  <text start="696.55" dur="6.54">that seven percent controls fifty</text>
  <text start="699.74" dur="6.99">percent of government that seven percent</text>
  <text start="703.09" dur="6.04">controls 97 percent of arts and</text>
  <text start="706.73" dur="4.26">entertainment and if you look at and at</text>
  <text start="709.13" dur="3.21">this but he didn&amp;#39;t show academia but if</text>
  <text start="710.99" dur="2.61">you showed upper schools of academia</text>
  <text start="712.34" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;d be real similar to arts</text>
  <text start="713.6" dur="4.32">entertainment so we&amp;#39;ve given up as</text>
  <text start="715.94" dur="4.65">Christian Patriots those mountains and</text>
  <text start="717.92" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;ve got to go take him back sure and</text>
  <text start="720.59" dur="3">I&amp;#39;ve been saying this actually for a</text>
  <text start="721.85" dur="3.81">long time that the best chance we have</text>
  <text start="723.59" dur="2.73">of winning the culture war is to wake up</text>
  <text start="725.66" dur="3.65">the Christians</text>
  <text start="726.32" dur="5.46">I mean largely kind of sleeping giant</text>
  <text start="729.31" dur="4.87">exactly right we just can&amp;#39;t be God bam</text>
  <text start="731.78" dur="3.78">football anymore we have to we have to</text>
  <text start="734.18" dur="3.87">fight all areas because they&amp;#39;ve taken</text>
  <text start="735.56" dur="3.87">over all seven mountains now and that</text>
  <text start="738.05" dur="3">and I take it over that top three</text>
  <text start="739.43" dur="3.18">percent of the mountain again not Eminem</text>
  <text start="741.05" dur="4.56">not dominion theology just a way to</text>
  <text start="742.61" dur="4.41">categorize and understand that to think</text>
  <text start="745.61" dur="2.82">big there&amp;#39;s gonna be a lot of free</text>
  <text start="747.02" dur="3.54">things you can do like Mark Taylor talks</text>

  <text start="820.55" dur="3.39">thing it&amp;#39;s kind of the idea at least in</text>

  <text start="832.92" dur="6.69">killed and called bond High School right</text>
  <text start="835.08" dur="6.96">back in back in 1994 I think it was but</text>

  <text start="842.04" dur="4.32">where she got killed because she had six</text>
  <text start="843.839" dur="5.791">Diaries and she had one picture of her</text>
  <text start="846.36" dur="6.81">hands and she wrote in there one day</text>

  <text start="861.57" dur="4.38">Rachel&amp;#39;s Challenge one of her challenges</text>
  <text start="863.399" dur="4.711">was be kind to each other</text>

  <text start="869.88" dur="3.51">incredible message in these Diaries all</text>
  <text start="871.649" dur="3.901">these inspirational quotes on these</text>
  <text start="873.39" dur="4.17">Diaries and he pulled him in to a</text>
  <text start="875.55" dur="3.87">mechanism or went and spoke to schools</text>
  <text start="877.56" dur="4.98">and he started having an amazing effect</text>
  <text start="879.42" dur="5.63">on schools but he could only get to 20</text>
  <text start="882.54" dur="5.489">you know a year type thing to really</text>
  <text start="885.05" dur="4.99">deliver this and then and then it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="888.029" dur="3.541">just going in from the school it was</text>
  <text start="890.04" dur="3.359">like training them how to change their</text>
  <text start="891.57" dur="4.17">culture in the school and Rachel&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.399" dur="4.831">Challenge become a huge success but he</text>
  <text start="895.74" dur="4.909">couldn&amp;#39;t scale it he used a lot of the</text>
  <text start="898.23" dur="6.33">concepts I&amp;#39;ll be teaching and he and</text>
  <text start="900.649" dur="7.211">growing his team and now he has 50</text>
  <text start="904.56" dur="6.93">speakers that go to over a thousand</text>
  <text start="907.86" dur="8.039">school every year and so now Rachael&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="911.49" dur="5.339">vision came true her hands you know</text>
  <text start="915.899" dur="3.75">which are part of all that of course</text>
  <text start="916.829" dur="5.791">Matt I never did that twice in the video</text>

  <text start="929.399" dur="6.531">like four point seven million students</text>
  <text start="932.55" dur="6.029">have been affected by Rachel&amp;#39;s hands</text>
  <text start="935.93" dur="4.599">scenes can grow into great things and</text>
  <text start="938.579" dur="4.171">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s obviously the academia</text>
  <text start="940.529" dur="3.391">mountain so he&amp;#39;s making huge Colt you</text>
  <text start="942.75" dur="2.459">see you see how that&amp;#39;s um so much</text>
  <text start="943.92" dur="4.08">different than just volunteering your</text>
  <text start="945.209" dur="4.951">time and create an organization that was</text>
  <text start="948" dur="4.5">adding value to schools that the schools</text>
  <text start="950.16" dur="4.799">are paying his speakers to come in and</text>
  <text start="952.5" dur="5.04">to train them so he expanded to multiple</text>
  <text start="954.959" dur="3.261">offerings he got revenue coming in as a</text>
  <text start="957.54" dur="3.2">business</text>
  <text start="958.22" dur="4.92">and he&amp;#39;s doing amazing things in a</text>
  <text start="960.74" dur="4.59">scaled way that&amp;#39;s how you&amp;#39;ve Soros back</text>
  <text start="963.14" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s not by just volunteering your time</text>
  <text start="965.33" dur="4.38">yeah starting businesses and you know</text>
  <text start="967.7" dur="3.15">doing things not only with your time but</text>
  <text start="969.71" dur="4.26">with your talents that help the world</text>
  <text start="970.85" dur="4.05">and and can be scaled and you know are</text>
  <text start="973.97" dur="3.9">sustainable</text>
  <text start="974.9" dur="5.19">you know sometimes requires funding yeah</text>
  <text start="977.87" dur="4.32">exactly right and so so the way the</text>
  <text start="980.09" dur="3.87">system works is pretty simple I mean the</text>
  <text start="982.19" dur="2.94">first week of a five-week class like I</text>
  <text start="983.96" dur="3.33">take people through a five-week course</text>
  <text start="985.13" dur="6.33">that starts on Monday and and that</text>
  <text start="987.29" dur="5.49">five-week course teaches you these three</text>
  <text start="991.46" dur="3">major things number one is it just</text>
  <text start="992.78" dur="4.47">helped me helps confirm your passion</text>
  <text start="994.46" dur="5.58">area we&amp;#39;re gonna take assessments take</text>
  <text start="997.25" dur="4.53">take some questionnaires go through my</text>
  <text start="1000.04" dur="2.85">training and then at the end of that</text>
  <text start="1001.78" dur="2.55">you&amp;#39;re gonna really understand which of</text>
  <text start="1002.89" dur="3.09">the seven mountains should you focus on</text>
  <text start="1004.33" dur="2.76">in the short term you can change that</text>
  <text start="1005.98" dur="2.04">later but that&amp;#39;s the first thing the</text>
  <text start="1007.09" dur="3.12">second thing is this really</text>
  <text start="1008.02" dur="3.54">understanding what your giftings are so</text>
  <text start="1010.21" dur="3.33">I can get balanced teams and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1011.56" dur="3.6">understand personality type and social</text>
  <text start="1013.54" dur="4.5">style as well as your spiritual gifts</text>
  <text start="1015.16" dur="4.11">and I call that the team gifting and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1018.04" dur="3.42">gonna form teams and then they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1019.27" dur="4.44">practice what I have done all my whole</text>
  <text start="1021.46" dur="4.11">career and for large consulting</text>
  <text start="1023.71" dur="4.14">companies and that has helped that team</text>
  <text start="1025.57" dur="3.78">be incredibly effective using setting</text>
  <text start="1027.85" dur="3.15">outcomes that are not small outcomes</text>
  <text start="1029.35" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s these big outcome zanpakutou and</text>
  <text start="1031" dur="3.87">then how to use agile techniques to</text>
  <text start="1033.07" dur="5.55">actually achieve results every few weeks</text>
  <text start="1034.87" dur="5.13">and so that way we can out execute Soros</text>
  <text start="1038.62" dur="3.6">because we&amp;#39;re argue they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1040" dur="3.69">effective and they&amp;#39;re gonna have big</text>
  <text start="1042.22" dur="3.33">outcomes that we&amp;#39;re gonna go achieve</text>
  <text start="1043.69" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re gonna practice that in weeks three</text>
  <text start="1045.55" dur="3.69">through five and then we&amp;#39;ll go into a</text>
  <text start="1047.41" dur="3.11">community that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m spending so</text>
