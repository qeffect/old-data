  <text start="103.86" dur="4.619">history of journalism and exactly where</text>
  <text start="105.54" dur="5.399">it should be as opposed to this corrupt</text>
  <text start="108.479" dur="5.041">big corporate media monster where we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="4.89">ended up so this is an amazing thing to</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="6.029">see it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a great time to be</text>
  <text start="115.829" dur="6.631">alive I also want to mention John McAfee</text>
  <text start="119.549" dur="4.53">here so look you guys know I&amp;#39;m a fan of</text>
  <text start="122.46" dur="3">his he&amp;#39;s such a crazy character I love</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="4.831">to watch his Twitter account and just</text>
  <text start="125.46" dur="6.72">all the funny things he does but now</text>
  <text start="128.91" dur="3.92">he&amp;#39;s talking about and this is an email</text>
  <text start="132.18" dur="4.46">that he</text>
  <text start="132.83" dur="5.13">sent to Robert David Steele and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.64" dur="3.03">basically threatening the government</text>
  <text start="137.96" dur="3.96">he&amp;#39;s saying mr. Steele I&amp;#39;m no longer in</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="4.5">the shadows I have kept my peace and</text>
  <text start="141.92" dur="4.89">taken no action against pretended friend</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="5.07">and outright foe alike but I have</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="5.13">strapped on my buried guns and whoa it</text>
  <text start="149.24" dur="4.8">be or woe be it to anyone who stands in</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="4.23">my way there is not a single scrap of</text>
  <text start="154.04" dur="4.8">information riding in this corrupt world</text>
  <text start="156.17" dur="4.86">that I cannot uncover the US government</text>
  <text start="158.84" dur="5.46">has never faced a foe like me before and</text>
  <text start="161.03" dur="5.1">I am a most reluctant foe I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="164.3" dur="5.01">everything within my power to keep the</text>
  <text start="166.13" dur="5.31">peace but as resilient as I have tried</text>
  <text start="169.31" dur="5.64">to be I will suffer this onslaught and</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="6.81">no longer those who have awoken me will</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="6">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where it goes but our</text>
  <text start="178.25" dur="4.8">here this will soon see their error I</text>
  <text start="180.95" dur="6.15">remained your friend for as long as you</text>
  <text start="183.05" dur="6">can take the reflective heat and Robert</text>
  <text start="187.1" dur="3.54">had said burn his ass take photos I will</text>
  <text start="189.05" dur="3.74">post them probably not a real case</text>
  <text start="190.64" dur="5.79">officer just a lightweight paramilitary</text>
  <text start="192.79" dur="6.34">so anyway basically what the context of</text>
  <text start="196.43" dur="7.11">this is is that John McAfee like super</text>
  <text start="199.13" dur="6.81">hacker you know antivirus legend is</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="5.46">declaring war on the deep state corrupt</text>
  <text start="205.94" dur="5.94">intelligence cabal saying I got dirt on</text>
  <text start="209" dur="4.83">all of you I&amp;#39;m John effin McAfee and</text>
  <text start="211.88" dur="3.45">this you know this is what I do and</text>
  <text start="213.83" dur="3.93">that&amp;#39;s kind of his attitude I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="215.33" dur="4.77">respected kind of you know he&amp;#39;s cocky</text>
  <text start="217.76" dur="5.58">he&amp;#39;s brash he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a braggart and and</text>
  <text start="220.1" dur="5.79">look I respect humility and I warn often</text>
  <text start="223.34" dur="4.17">about the the threat of the ego he make</text>
  <text start="225.89" dur="4.17">mistakes when your ego gets ahead of you</text>
  <text start="227.51" dur="4.949">but he is a funny guy he got his you</text>
  <text start="230.06" dur="4.98">gotta admit and I&amp;#39;m very interested to</text>
  <text start="232.459" dur="5.25">see what he can do I mean this is not an</text>
  <text start="235.04" dur="5.79">idle threat this is coming from one of</text>
  <text start="237.709" dur="6.181">the powerhouses of information in the</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="5.79">world I believe him when he says nothing</text>
  <text start="243.89" dur="5.67">in this world is secret from him a lot</text>
  <text start="246.62" dur="4.679">of it probably is not so continuing on</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="3.63">and he&amp;#39;s made he&amp;#39;s made other threats</text>
  <text start="251.299" dur="5.491">since then remember he&amp;#39;s on the run from</text>
  <text start="253.19" dur="5.4">the IRS he&amp;#39;s on a buddy of his who owns</text>
  <text start="256.79" dur="3.449">a bunch of Bitcoin had a yacht so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="3.54">out there like in Venezuela and other</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="4.561">places just kind of living it up and on</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="4.5">the run from the IRS cuz he decided to</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="4.34">just not I guess pay taxes and</text>
  <text start="266.63" dur="4.47">talk about it openly and brag about it</text>
  <text start="269.14" dur="3.79">which is funny because there&amp;#39;s all these</text>
  <text start="271.1" dur="3.51">legal ways to not pay taxes that you</text>
  <text start="272.93" dur="6">should probably learn like the puerto</text>
  <text start="274.61" dur="5.79">rico thing but people they you know he</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="5.22">went about it the wrong way he</text>
  <text start="280.4" dur="5.76">challenged the IRS me monster and you</text>
  <text start="284.15" dur="4.65">know they always try to make examples so</text>
  <text start="286.16" dur="4.17">of course we also have my cross child</text>
  <text start="288.8" dur="4.71">again not a real lost child they would</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="4.65">probably kick him out if he was a long</text>
  <text start="293.51" dur="4.08">thread he&amp;#39;s too much of an embarrassment</text>
  <text start="294.98" dur="4.59">i guess oh he says a long thread of</text>
  <text start="297.59" dur="4.26">conspiracy theory q and on raving ends</text>
  <text start="299.57" dur="4.65">with we should want to do it ourselves</text>
  <text start="301.85" dur="4.65">it might be the only way and then he</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="5.1">says non-violent and of course my</text>
  <text start="306.5" dur="5.7">response was just a link to the</text>
  <text start="309.32" dur="4.56">Breitbart thing about over 600 acts of</text>
  <text start="312.2" dur="4.38">media approved violence and harassment</text>
  <text start="313.88" dur="4.65">from the left so you know and i say you</text>
  <text start="316.58" dur="4.08">were saying it&amp;#39;s a very simple point if</text>
  <text start="318.53" dur="3.93">you won&amp;#39;t take responsibility for your</text>
  <text start="320.66" dur="3.44">six seven hundred crazies that we know</text>
  <text start="322.46" dur="4.53">about we&amp;#39;re how can it take</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="5.98">responsibility for someone we&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="326.99" dur="4.83">heard about right so they keep trying to</text>
  <text start="330.08" dur="3.84">pull out these fringe characters not</text>
  <text start="331.82" dur="5.01">leaders and they try to plant them as</text>
  <text start="333.92" dur="5.13">leaders you know just like alex jones</text>
  <text start="336.83" dur="4.14">did when he when he interviewed captain</text>
  <text start="339.05" dur="3.54">roy who&amp;#39;s told me himself you know i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="340.97" dur="3.42">not trying to become a leader or</text>
  <text start="342.59" dur="3.18">anything else i do my articles that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.39" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s kind of the extent of it i want</text>
  <text start="345.77" dur="3.9">to write a book I&amp;#39;ll talk about the flu</text>
  <text start="347.72" dur="3.84">but you know he doesn&amp;#39;t even want to</text>
  <text start="349.67" dur="4.08">necessarily be out there in front of the</text>
  <text start="351.56" dur="4.77">spotlights other than his foot and then</text>
  <text start="353.75" dur="4.56">Alex Jones calls him in and makes the</text>
  <text start="356.33" dur="3.9">video like he&amp;#39;s interviewing queueing on</text>
  <text start="358.31" dur="4.62">himself right this is the games they</text>
  <text start="360.23" dur="4.98">play they can&amp;#39;t take the real heat from</text>
  <text start="362.93" dur="4.56">the leaders of the Q&amp;amp;R movement or the</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="5.22">Free Speech Movement or the mainstream</text>
  <text start="367.49" dur="4.86">media movement or the alternative to the</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="5.1">mainstream media movement you know the</text>
  <text start="372.35" dur="4.83">the new media right they seem to be able</text>
  <text start="375.53" dur="3.54">to pick on the little guy don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="377.18" dur="2.34">and that&amp;#39;s kind of where it&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="379.07" dur="2.79">been</text>
  <text start="379.52" dur="4.38">and that&amp;#39;s deflection from and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="381.86" dur="3.69">tactic that&amp;#39;s a you know that&amp;#39;s a straw</text>
  <text start="383.9" dur="3.66">man is what it&amp;#39;s called and debate</text>
  <text start="385.55" dur="4.08">terminology and people really need to</text>
  <text start="387.56" dur="4.05">learn that term cuz once you&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="389.63" dur="3.6">I think I learned it at fifteen or</text>
  <text start="391.61" dur="3.3">sixteen years old and once I learned it</text>
  <text start="393.23" dur="4.86">I couldn&amp;#39;t watch TV anymore because I</text>
  <text start="394.91" dur="4.47">saw so many logical fallacies in every</text>
  <text start="398.09" dur="3.09">TV show</text>
  <text start="399.38" dur="3.99">and I saw them trying to manipulate me</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="4.5">and I just it irritates me now so I</text>
  <text start="403.37" dur="8.51">can&amp;#39;t watch TV and even the movies is</text>

  <text start="462.44" dur="2.88">and autism and things of that nature</text>
  <text start="463.43" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s so much good we could do in the</text>

  <text start="1355.63" dur="4.92">Wow right we we have a false accusation</text>

  <text start="1367.24" dur="3.689">here either</text>
  <text start="1368.23" dur="5.91">we look into how the president reacted</text>

  <text start="1380.41" dur="5.19">apart now to me it seems like a far more</text>
  <text start="1382.78" dur="4.62">relevant inquiry to figure out why the</text>
  <text start="1385.6" dur="4.05">FISA Court was lied to something that</text>
  <text start="1387.4" dur="5.13">you have spoken a great deal about mr.</text>

  <text start="1398.14" dur="4.41">before the FISA Court none of that we</text>
  <text start="1400.24" dur="4.2">also would love to know why the FBI</text>
  <text start="1402.55" dur="3.45">turned from an organization that was</text>

  <text start="1410.14" dur="4.2">regime of leadership lying and leaking</text>
  <text start="1412.96" dur="2.64">and the reason they were doing it is</text>
  <text start="1414.34" dur="3.33">because they didn&amp;#39;t really think that</text>
  <text start="1415.6" dur="4.079">the job of the FBI was to investigate</text>
  <text start="1417.67" dur="3.75">and prize and bring cases for</text>

  <text start="1423.22" dur="3.54">and that&amp;#39;s really why we&amp;#39;re here and</text>
  <text start="1425.26" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s what I really think all Americans</text>
  <text start="1426.76" dur="3.96">ought to have an interest in stopping</text>
  <text start="1428.59" dur="3.99">and you held these views you wrote them</text>
  <text start="1430.72" dur="4.38">down you said that illegal surveillance</text>
  <text start="1432.58" dur="4.08">was one of the worst things that we</text>

  <text start="1805.99" dur="5.73">committees fair to investigate how the</text>
  <text start="1808.84" dur="4.23">whole Trump Russia thing started this is</text>

  <text start="1813.07" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re supposed how this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1815.68" dur="3.84">began and I said this a few weeks ago</text>
  <text start="1817.87" dur="2.94">but I want to remind this committee what</text>
  <text start="1819.52" dur="4.47">the Attorney General the United States</text>
  <text start="1820.81" dur="5.91">said eight weeks ago when he testified</text>

  <text start="1845.62" dur="6.42">basis for his concern about the spying</text>
  <text start="1848.11" dur="6.09">that took place and he used two terms</text>
  <text start="1852.04" dur="3.69">that again I think this committee should</text>
  <text start="1854.2" dur="4.68">find frightening it should be looking</text>
  <text start="1855.73" dur="7.11">into unauthorized surveillance and</text>
  <text start="1858.88" dur="5.22">political surveillance scary terms so</text>
  <text start="1862.84" dur="3.36">the good news is even though this</text>
  <text start="1864.1" dur="4.14">Congress has memorandums of</text>
  <text start="1866.2" dur="3.21">understanding between the key committee</text>

  <text start="1888.07" dur="4.8">news is mr. Durham&amp;#39;s doing that but this</text>
  <text start="1890.86" dur="4.02">is this is the part I think that</text>
  <text start="1892.87" dur="3.33">frustrates so many mr. chairman I would</text>
  <text start="1894.88" dur="3.03">hope the Judiciary Committee in that</text>
  <text start="1896.2" dur="3.36">history this committee has for</text>
  <text start="1897.91" dur="4.14">protecting fundamental liberties would</text>
  <text start="1899.56" dur="4.44">begin to look into those key issues the</text>

  <text start="1924.19" dur="3.84">country that should be what this</text>
  <text start="1926.17" dur="4.8">committee most safeguards and most</text>
  <text start="1928.03" dur="4.95">protects and instead we got memorandums</text>
  <text start="1930.97" dur="4.02">of understanding between the chairman we</text>
  <text start="1932.98" dur="3.84">got Michael Cohen testifying for seven</text>
