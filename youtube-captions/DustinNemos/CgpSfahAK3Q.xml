  <text start="890.38" dur="4.38">kind of I guess engage you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="892.93" dur="3.72">more fun than a soap opera or TV show</text>

  <text start="913.71" dur="8.29">just kind of moving on from that oops</text>
  <text start="920.23" dur="4.29">alright my little one the room with some</text>
  <text start="922" dur="4.41">toys and stuff okay so kind of back to</text>
  <text start="924.52" dur="4.89">focus here I was just kind of going into</text>
  <text start="926.41" dur="5.43">why people enjoy the cue movement it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="929.41" dur="5.55">fun but beyond that we get information</text>
  <text start="931.84" dur="6.24">sometimes years ahead years ahead of</text>
  <text start="934.96" dur="4.44">everyone else so that is also oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="938.08" dur="3">important to understand at least take</text>
  <text start="939.4" dur="3.09">into account even if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="941.08" dur="4.14">necessarily believe in the cue</text>
  <text start="942.49" dur="4.77">movement the information is often very</text>
  <text start="945.22" dur="3.42">very good and it is you know the</text>
  <text start="947.26" dur="2.88">Socratic method so it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="948.64" dur="3.6">matter who is asking it could be some</text>

  <text start="959.05" dur="2.729">do some research and you answer that</text>
  <text start="960.43" dur="2.76">question and then you come up with oh my</text>

  <text start="963.19" dur="4.29">and we need to expose it you start</text>

  <text start="967.48" dur="4.77">sort of seeing the map for it for its</text>

  <text start="982.839" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s a big big deal especially when</text>
  <text start="986.41" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;re working together and we already</text>
  <text start="988.029" dur="5.37">knew that the influence was massive</text>
  <text start="989.77" dur="4.28">now we also and remember exponential</text>
  <text start="993.399" dur="3.121">growth</text>
  <text start="994.05" dur="4.599">remember they cut down the reddit board</text>
  <text start="996.52" dur="4.2">because when they actually posted the</text>

  <text start="1000.72" dur="3.36">movement growth it went from like a</text>
  <text start="1001.98" dur="3.6">couple I think I don&amp;#39;t remember I showed</text>
  <text start="1004.08" dur="3.569">in the time but it was like a thousand</text>
  <text start="1005.58" dur="4.62">in 2000 then like four thousand and then</text>
  <text start="1007.649" dur="4.711">rotates that almost exponential growth</text>
  <text start="1010.2" dur="4.61">it almost doubled every time in some</text>
  <text start="1012.36" dur="4.53">cases more than government now we also</text>
  <text start="1014.81" dur="3.16">right then that&amp;#39;s why they had to get</text>
  <text start="1016.89" dur="2.91">rid of it they didn&amp;#39;t want you to see</text>
  <text start="1017.97" dur="4.859">the human that growing into the millions</text>
  <text start="1019.8" dur="7.139">and then of course the DNC chairman</text>

  <text start="1026.939" dur="8.461">is what makes capitalism work it makes</text>
  <text start="1032.339" dur="5.48">my brain hurt just a little bit I think</text>
  <text start="1035.4" dur="8.549">my brain is actually crying right now</text>
  <text start="1037.819" dur="8.26">and why well that makes no sense it</text>
  <text start="1043.949" dur="5.581">makes no sense at all in fact they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1046.079" dur="7.111">complete opposites socialism is based on</text>
  <text start="1049.53" dur="6.99">force and theft and mob rule and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1053.19" dur="5.88">not it&amp;#39;s people like to say socialism or</text>
  <text start="1056.52" dur="4.71">communism versus fascism right but in</text>
  <text start="1059.07" dur="4.71">fact they&amp;#39;re virtually the same thing</text>
  <text start="1061.23" dur="5.76">and let me qualify this people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1063.78" dur="5.79">understand this and and frankly it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1066.99" dur="4.47">simplification and I understand that but</text>
  <text start="1069.57" dur="3.93">a little bit of background on myself I</text>
  <text start="1071.46" dur="4.419">spent over a year debating philosophy on</text>
  <text start="1073.5" dur="6.009">Facebook groups where</text>
  <text start="1075.879" dur="5.28">is actually pretty damn fiery okay a lot</text>
  <text start="1079.509" dur="3.48">of antiva times in there because they</text>
  <text start="1081.159" dur="3.9">pretend to be anarchists and they like</text>
  <text start="1082.989" dur="3.84">to debate philosophy and they like to go</text>
  <text start="1085.059" dur="3.81">in there and advocate for socialism</text>
  <text start="1086.829" dur="3.51">communism because there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1088.869" dur="4.2">basically just keyboard keyboard</text>
  <text start="1090.339" dur="4.11">warriors and that&amp;#39;s what they do that</text>
  <text start="1093.069" dur="3">all they do is whine and bitch and</text>
  <text start="1094.449" dur="4.17">complain on the internet all the time so</text>
  <text start="1096.069" dur="4.5">I cut my teeth on philosophy by debating</text>
  <text start="1098.619" dur="3.42">people like that all the time and then</text>
  <text start="1100.569" dur="3.63">of course I got into some of the finer</text>

  <text start="1106.569" dur="4.11">socialism communism and fascism in there</text>
  <text start="1108.489" dur="3.77">right these isms have to be explained</text>
  <text start="1110.679" dur="4.23">and from a philosophical standpoint</text>

  <text start="1650.1" dur="7.56">transphobia they have a bunch of them</text>
  <text start="1652.58" dur="7.59">why because communism seeks power why</text>
  <text start="1657.66" dur="5.67">does it seek power because it wants</text>

  <text start="1675.45" dur="6.63">in fact in many cases it&amp;#39;s been shown so</text>
  <text start="1678.47" dur="5.47">is that because you have more social</text>
