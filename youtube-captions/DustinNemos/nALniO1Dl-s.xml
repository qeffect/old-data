  <text start="165" dur="5.76">has been put in jail just for asking a</text>
  <text start="168.48" dur="5.25">protest on on Facebook this is a</text>
  <text start="170.76" dur="5.88">breaking news like like we can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="6">now share information on Facebook or we</text>
  <text start="176.64" dur="5.159">could be jailed for that like and this</text>
  <text start="179.73" dur="4.259">is just getting completely out of</text>
  <text start="181.799" dur="4.02">control I think that this may be an</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="4.86">interesting point to use but anti-fur</text>
  <text start="185.819" dur="4.111">actually created their own app you may</text>
  <text start="188.849" dur="3.45">be able to use it against them I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="3.96">know it&amp;#39;s an idea well okay they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.299" dur="4.171">coordinating with these apps on the</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="4.98">phone now just technology sometimes</text>
  <text start="196.47" dur="3.72">gives us an edge but what&amp;#39;s happening</text>
  <text start="198.87" dur="2.94">what you&amp;#39;re describing and I know</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="5.43">children are being hurt - I mean this is</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="7.259">brutality brutality we have hundreds of</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="5.479">hours of videos showing cops being of</text>
  <text start="209.069" dur="5.341">peaceful citizens including</text>
  <text start="211.099" dur="7.51">grandfather&amp;#39;s like aged people young</text>
  <text start="214.41" dur="5.759">people who moon like everyone they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="218.609" dur="4.821">distinguish anything they receive orders</text>
  <text start="220.169" dur="6.391">and and it just apply orders which is</text>
  <text start="223.43" dur="5.83">really shameful but that&amp;#39;s the way it is</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="3.989">so yeah I just wanted people to</text>
  <text start="229.26" dur="5.159">understand that what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="230.549" dur="7.761">insurance is really abnormal we are</text>
  <text start="234.419" dur="6.9">considering raising a child and again</text>
  <text start="238.31" dur="8.22">attacking the president macron and the</text>
  <text start="241.319" dur="8.401">prime minister in the tribunal of LA for</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="6.76">crime against humanity because what has</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="6.299">happened is going way beyond normal and</text>
  <text start="253.29" dur="5.159">friends isn&amp;#39;t just a dictator would</text>
  <text start="256.019" dur="8.001">dictate you mean not going to let our</text>
  <text start="258.449" dur="8.4">country twelve down in that direction or</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="3.91">another thing that happened as well is</text>
  <text start="266.849" dur="4.941">that last</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="7.14">the Parliament voted a law that was</text>
  <text start="271.79" dur="6.37">criminalizing the protest this is the</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="6.629">breaking news as well it hasn&amp;#39;t happened</text>
  <text start="278.16" dur="7.11">for for the until this the second world</text>
  <text start="281.699" dur="7.521">war like it didn&amp;#39;t and that his people</text>
  <text start="285.27" dur="7.8">could face criminal</text>
  <text start="289.22" dur="5.77">sting for us it actually mean that the</text>
  <text start="293.07" dur="5.49">Parliament and the people in power are</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="5.7">really afraid and they&amp;#39;re really feeling</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="4.65">the stress about the situation and that</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="6.42">they are behaving in a most stupid way</text>
  <text start="303.21" dur="5.9">because like the the representant is the</text>
  <text start="307.11" dur="4.98">person that is present on our behalf</text>
  <text start="309.11" dur="6.52">he&amp;#39;s not a master he&amp;#39;s first and there</text>
  <text start="312.09" dur="5.639">is representing representing present at</text>
  <text start="315.63" dur="5.819">the on our behalf and when the</text>
  <text start="317.729" dur="7.231">representant is telling us which is the</text>
  <text start="321.449" dur="6.481">power what to do what to think this is</text>
  <text start="324.96" dur="6.72">where they start to exist as as power</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="5.609">they basically return again the source</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="5.25">of their of their power and suddenly</text>
  <text start="333.539" dur="6.63">their own power disappear so you know</text>
  <text start="336.93" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;ve got to add to this France in the</text>
  <text start="340.169" dur="3.421">u.s. we go way back together like you</text>
  <text start="342.06" dur="3.87">guys helped us out when we declared</text>
  <text start="343.59" dur="4.74">independence and our Revolutionary War</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="4.44">know that we may not have been able to</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="3.119">successfully break away from England</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="3.299">without your help</text>
  <text start="351.449" dur="3.811">and you know I&amp;#39;ve always felt kind of</text>
  <text start="353.669" dur="3.901">like France is one of those cultural</text>
  <text start="355.26" dur="4.86">centers that was closely aligned with us</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="5.339">and had compatible values and that sort</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="4.65">of thing you know one of the famous</text>
  <text start="362.909" dur="3.51">expressions that that came out of all of</text>
  <text start="364.77" dur="5.28">this freedom movement that we have is</text>
  <text start="366.419" dur="5.31">that the the tree of liberty must be</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="3.989">watered from time to time with the blood</text>
  <text start="371.729" dur="4.44">of patriots and tyrants alike and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="374.039" dur="4.291">something that I think you guys are I</text>
  <text start="376.169" dur="3.451">mean you&amp;#39;re shedding the blood and I</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="3.059">really appreciate that you&amp;#39;re doing that</text>
  <text start="379.62" dur="3.019">not just for France but you know for the</text>
  <text start="381.389" dur="3.78">world this is setting a great example</text>
  <text start="382.639" dur="4.181">you know a nonviolent example you guys</text>
  <text start="385.169" dur="3.75">are basically just taking these hits and</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="3.75">such and anything I can do like I said</text>
  <text start="388.919" dur="4.171">any time to help you get these updates</text>
  <text start="390.57" dur="3.08">out or you know spread word just let me</text>
  <text start="393.09" dur="3.78">know</text>
  <text start="393.65" dur="4.84">yeah sure like the advice that you give</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="4.68">us last time to protect ourselves has</text>
  <text start="398.49" dur="3.33">been removed by the the police because</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="3.15">we</text>
  <text start="401.82" dur="5.97">we go to protests we are checked and we</text>
  <text start="404.7" dur="6.36">can&amp;#39;t wear anything even to protect us</text>
  <text start="407.79" dur="6.83">even a mask a cask has to be removed</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="6.6">because they could be used as a weapon</text>
  <text start="414.62" dur="5.37">so we can&amp;#39;t even protect ourselves which</text>
  <text start="417.66" dur="6.57">is again going again going against</text>
  <text start="419.99" dur="6.7">international genève laws for war like</text>
  <text start="424.23" dur="4.29">the right to protect yourself even</text>
  <text start="426.69" dur="4.05">civilian do not have the right to</text>
  <text start="428.52" dur="6.21">protect themselves if you&amp;#39;re wearing a</text>
  <text start="430.74" dur="6.63">scarf to protect your your lungs from</text>
  <text start="434.73" dur="4.56">tear gas and poison gas</text>
  <text start="437.37" dur="3.6">they will attack you saying that you try</text>
  <text start="439.29" dur="3.72">to protect your face or try to hide your</text>
  <text start="440.97" dur="2.22">identity and it could arrest you for</text>
  <text start="443.01" dur="3.63">that</text>
  <text start="443.19" dur="7.26">so even wearing a scarf is now forbidden</text>
  <text start="446.64" dur="6.63">to to that law so you&amp;#39;re starting to see</text>
  <text start="450.45" dur="4.29">that this is getting very very weak I</text>
  <text start="453.27" dur="5.25">think we&amp;#39;re getting closer to the end</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="5.91">because when such a dramatic action are</text>
  <text start="458.52" dur="5.85">taking off it seems that there would be</text>
  <text start="460.65" dur="6.45">no way the way out gonna be them against</text>
  <text start="464.37" dur="5.4">us and we are 65 million</text>
  <text start="467.1" dur="6.78">they have maximum a hundred thousand</text>
  <text start="469.77" dur="6.96">cops so no matter how much they are like</text>
  <text start="473.88" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s impossible I honestly admire</text>
  <text start="476.73" dur="4.08">greatly you not just you know not just</text>
  <text start="478.95" dur="3.18">in France with you guys but here with</text>
  <text start="480.81" dur="2.76">the magnet movement as well like</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="3.69">Patriots from every nation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="483.57" dur="3.81">standing up to globalism they&amp;#39;re holding</text>
  <text start="485.82" dur="3.75">back from doing a lot of this violence</text>
  <text start="487.38" dur="4.41">like 400 cases of violence against</text>
  <text start="489.57" dur="4.56">Patriots here in the last couple of</text>
  <text start="491.79" dur="4.05">years maybe one or two cases of violence</text>
  <text start="494.13" dur="3.75">the other way like our side is very</text>
  <text start="495.84" dur="4.89">restrained on violence we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="497.88" dur="3.99">hurt people but they keep doing this and</text>
  <text start="500.73" dur="3.18">they keep pushing and they keep pushing</text>
  <text start="501.87" dur="4.08">the the next obvious thing that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="503.91" dur="3.36">to happen someone is going to get hurt</text>
  <text start="505.95" dur="3.24">someone&amp;#39;s going to get angry they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="507.27" dur="3.81">going to push back and it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="509.19" dur="4.95">turn into violence on both sides and</text>
  <text start="511.08" dur="6.839">it&amp;#39;s fun but it&amp;#39;s really upsetting</text>
  <text start="514.14" dur="5.55">because we always hear on the TV on the</text>
  <text start="517.919" dur="3.901">mainstream media the violence against</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="4.289">the cops but whether people forgive or</text>
  <text start="521.82" dur="4.5">forget too is that the cops are heavily</text>
  <text start="523.979" dur="4.171">protected like we call them Robocop&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="526.32" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s not just by coincidence there have</text>
  <text start="528.15" dur="4.74">an armor on them so when we&amp;#39;re said well</text>
  <text start="530.91" dur="4.05">throwing it to there like some like</text>
  <text start="532.89" dur="2.94">stones or whatever they are heavily</text>
  <text start="534.96" dur="2.61">protected</text>
  <text start="535.83" dur="3.93">shield they have protection they have</text>
  <text start="537.57" dur="4.8">casted everything in front of them the</text>
  <text start="539.76" dur="5.94">people are naked in shield yeah entirely</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="6.33">naked okay so like no matter how</text>
  <text start="545.7" dur="7.95">efficient the machine they have like to</text>
  <text start="548.7" dur="7.59">generate 396 badly injured is huge a lot</text>
  <text start="553.65" dur="6.08">of people heard about Jill Merida gasps</text>
  <text start="556.29" dur="7.89">Roger gasps which is a popular figure</text>
  <text start="559.73" dur="7.3">yes but for one guy who had a chance to</text>
  <text start="564.18" dur="5.22">be exposed we had probably another 20</text>
  <text start="567.03" dur="4.92">people who lost an eye and hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="569.4" dur="4.59">exposed that at all we talk about women</text>
  <text start="571.95" dur="3.56">we talk about children we talk about</text>
  <text start="573.99" dur="6.51">people who has been badly injured and</text>
  <text start="575.51" dur="7.84">the blackout is outstanding heard the</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="7.35">expression that power comes from the end</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="6.57">of a gun or rifle I think it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="587.85" dur="4.56">expression not attributed to Chairman</text>
  <text start="589.92" dur="4.65">Mao of Communist China but in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="592.41" dur="3.69">world it&amp;#39;s kind of been morphed and it</text>
  <text start="594.57" dur="4.23">really in today&amp;#39;s world power comes from</text>
  <text start="596.1" dur="4.2">the end of a camera you know and is</text>
  <text start="598.8" dur="4.35">mightier than the sword kind of in</text>
  <text start="600.3" dur="4.8">modern terms but yeah and we have so</text>
  <text start="603.15" dur="5.78">many videos showing Cubs destroying</text>
  <text start="605.1" dur="7.65">cameras beating up journalists it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="608.93" dur="6.88">impressive and I&amp;#39;m so surprised to hear</text>
  <text start="612.75" dur="5.04">the total blackout in I&amp;#39;ve never seen a</text>
  <text start="615.81" dur="4.47">protester try to destroy a policeman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.79" dur="4.74">camera before to cover up evidence yeah</text>
  <text start="620.28" dur="5.85">yeah we have so many evidence showing</text>
  <text start="622.53" dur="6.93">that we even have people ask asked on</text>
  <text start="626.13" dur="6.57">the camera to erase pictures like me</text>

  <text start="742.81" dur="6.66">Saudis in a way and the last piece of</text>
  <text start="746.14" dur="5.79">evidence that we receive is that they</text>
  <text start="749.47" dur="5.55">media part had access to a recording of</text>
  <text start="751.93" dur="5.55">him basically saying that some</text>
