  <text start="0.29" dur="5.83">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="3.06" dur="5.52">most of destiny most calm and this is a</text>
  <text start="6.12" dur="5.21">big boom and those booms just keep on</text>
  <text start="8.58" dur="5.28">comin don&amp;#39;t they not only do we have bar</text>
  <text start="11.33" dur="4.9">exonerating Trump once again I mean how</text>
  <text start="13.86" dur="4.38">many times does that have to happen but</text>
  <text start="16.23" dur="4.68">now we have an axiom linked to the</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="5.94">Clintons very interesting so let&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="20.91" dur="6.209">of get the the overview here as reading</text>
  <text start="24.18" dur="5.669">through this kind of the the the primary</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="5.28">overarching theme that I got was back</text>
  <text start="29.849" dur="4.651">you know eight some of the nexium folks</text>
  <text start="32.399" dur="5.031">possibly you know like the Bronfman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="34.5" dur="5.969">were involved in helping to push</text>
  <text start="37.43" dur="5.649">campaign donations to the Clintons by</text>
  <text start="40.469" dur="5.311">forcing employees to donate probably the</text>
  <text start="43.079" dur="4.89">maximum amount and then paying them back</text>
  <text start="45.78" dur="5.189">sort of probably I guess sort of an</text>
  <text start="47.969" dur="5.461">elite workaround of probably a legal</text>
  <text start="50.969" dur="5.191">system you know thing that was in place</text>
  <text start="53.43" dur="5.399">to prevent that clearly why else do it</text>
  <text start="56.16" dur="4.32">so there are you know maximums and such</text>
  <text start="58.829" dur="3.361">and it&amp;#39;s a very confusing system</text>
  <text start="60.48" dur="3.12">honestly there should just be maximum</text>
  <text start="62.19" dur="2.939">transparency and then do whatever you</text>
  <text start="63.6" dur="4.62">want as long as it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="65.129" dur="4.681">hurt anyone but you know when there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="3.36">things done in secret it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="69.81" dur="3.26">what rules you make obviously people are</text>
  <text start="71.58" dur="5.219">going to find a way to gain the system</text>
  <text start="73.07" dur="8.26">just like this so we have a clear link</text>
  <text start="76.799" dur="7.801">between the Clintons and and nexium over</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="7.32">political influence so this ties sex</text>
  <text start="84.6" dur="6.479">trafficking to politics the boom and I</text>
  <text start="88.65" dur="3.57">want to be very clear about this this is</text>
  <text start="91.079" dur="2.881">the kind of article that gets</text>
  <text start="92.22" dur="4.469">disappeared usually pretty quickly so</text>
  <text start="93.96" dur="4.44">this is one of those bigger links we</text>
  <text start="96.689" dur="4.771">really don&amp;#39;t want it to disappear so</text>
  <text start="98.4" dur="5.21">make sure that you&amp;#39;re you know you can</text>
  <text start="101.46" dur="5.1">actually go to the website for example</text>
  <text start="103.61" dur="5.469">save right click it and go to save page</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="3.93">as and you can put it anywhere on your</text>
  <text start="109.079" dur="2.641">like your desktop or something is</text>
  <text start="110.49" dur="3.87">easiest place to find it if you&amp;#39;re on a</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="5.64">Windows at least I don&amp;#39;t know about max</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="4.23">and the other ones I hear good stuff</text>
  <text start="117.36" dur="2.7">about some of the open source ones</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="4.11">though I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ve never used them yet</text>
  <text start="120.06" dur="4.89">anyway you can actually save the the</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="3.93">webpage itself including like the</text>
  <text start="124.95" dur="4.199">pictures and all of the other stuff and</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="4.409">like all the little HTML mark marketing</text>
  <text start="129.149" dur="3.991">and ads and stuff I think it pulls it</text>
  <text start="131.039" dur="4.561">all and then it</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="4.77">actually puts a couple different files</text>
  <text start="135.6" dur="3.66">like a folder ana file and and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="137.91" dur="3.299">couple different things in there but you</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="4.32">keep that together as sort of one unit</text>
  <text start="141.209" dur="5.161">and then you have access to that page in</text>
  <text start="143.58" dur="5.58">theory you could if they ever censor it</text>
  <text start="146.37" dur="5.55">get it back out there so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="149.16" dur="4.049">new useful way to do that so um and</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="3.69">maybe you just make a folder for it</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="4.171">usually pages are not very big on</text>
  <text start="155.61" dur="5.22">computer space but you can check the</text>
  <text start="157.38" dur="5.67">size as you go so this is a big deal</text>
  <text start="160.83" dur="4.95">the clintons involved with you know</text>
  <text start="163.05" dur="6.18">nexium campaign contributions political</text>
