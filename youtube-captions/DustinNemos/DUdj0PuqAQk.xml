  <text start="4.58" dur="5.85">the majority home country that believes</text>
  <text start="7.76" dur="8.63">in freedom to Liberty are being held</text>
  <text start="10.43" dur="5.96">back by the most powerful force</text>
  <text start="29.41" dur="5.23">these big conservatives encouraging you</text>
  <text start="32.18" dur="4.29">to play the victim and blame the fact</text>
  <text start="34.64" dur="4.59">that you&amp;#39;re a conservative for any</text>
  <text start="36.47" dur="5.269">difficulties are lying to you because</text>
  <text start="39.23" dur="4.74">they only care about fame and money</text>
  <text start="41.739" dur="5.381">welcome back my friends this is destiny</text>
  <text start="43.97" dur="5.19">most of the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network komm</text>
  <text start="47.12" dur="4.619">anyway I wanted to bring you guys</text>
  <text start="49.16" dur="5.82">attention to a recent video by a guy on</text>
  <text start="51.739" dur="6.391">YouTube called hunter Avallone now he is</text>
  <text start="54.98" dur="4.56">a bit of a snarky guy claims to be a</text>
  <text start="58.13" dur="4.23">conservative and I&amp;#39;m not necessarily</text>
  <text start="59.54" dur="5.939">disputing that but he&amp;#39;s also come out</text>
  <text start="62.36" dur="5.009">recently with a talk at Penn State and</text>
  <text start="65.479" dur="4.25">here&amp;#39;s the video called I spoke at Penn</text>
  <text start="67.369" dur="5.28">State University and got protested and</text>
  <text start="69.729" dur="5.051">he made a lot of comments about</text>
  <text start="72.649" dur="4.741">censorship that just weren&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="74.78" dur="4.199">true and you know people felt and and</text>
  <text start="77.39" dur="3.18">had suggested to me that I should make</text>
  <text start="78.979" dur="3.06">some sort of a rebuttal video to that</text>
  <text start="80.57" dur="3.75">and I wanted to kind of take some of his</text>
  <text start="82.039" dur="3.181">arguments as I saw them in the video I</text>
  <text start="84.32" dur="3.45">watched the whole thing</text>
  <text start="85.22" dur="3.99">and some of his follow up stuff so I</text>
  <text start="87.77" dur="3.51">wanted to take some of those arguments</text>
  <text start="89.21" dur="4.38">and give context and explain why</text>
  <text start="91.28" dur="4.409">although probably well-meaning hunter</text>
  <text start="93.59" dur="4.26">Avallone was dead wrong on a lot of this</text>
  <text start="95.689" dur="4.68">and that censorship is actually quite</text>
  <text start="97.85" dur="4.44">real not fake it all and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="100.369" dur="5.101">happening especially on platforms like</text>
  <text start="102.29" dur="4.41">YouTube so I hope you guys enjoy let me</text>
  <text start="105.47" dur="3.12">know what you think in the comments and</text>
  <text start="106.7" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;ll dive through all the arguments of</text>
  <text start="108.59" dur="4.139">Hunter Avallone that censorship is not</text>
  <text start="110.9" dur="3.84">happening to conservatives on the</text>
  <text start="112.729" dur="5.331">Internet the way that people portray it</text>
  <text start="114.74" dur="6.21">so whatever that means so let&amp;#39;s dive in</text>
  <text start="118.06" dur="4.629">argument number one private companies</text>
  <text start="120.95" dur="2.84">are not subject to free speech</text>
  <text start="122.689" dur="3.841">protections</text>
  <text start="123.79" dur="4.93">I&amp;#39;m the discussion about big tech</text>
  <text start="126.53" dur="5.22">censorship arises you&amp;#39;re quick to hear</text>
  <text start="128.72" dur="5.94">right-wing pundits invoke freedom of</text>
  <text start="131.75" dur="5.76">speech but big tech censorship is not a</text>
  <text start="134.66" dur="5.669">free speech issue even if all claims of</text>
  <text start="137.51" dur="5.49">censorship are 100% true this would</text>
  <text start="140.329" dur="3.931">still not be a free speech issue the</text>
  <text start="143" dur="3.15">First Amendment protects us from</text>
  <text start="144.26" dur="4.289">government infringing on our freedom of</text>
  <text start="146.15" dur="4.38">speech Facebook along with all the other</text>
  <text start="148.549" dur="4.651">social media platforms are free to ban</text>
  <text start="150.53" dur="3.87">people as it&amp;#39;s a private company so I</text>
  <text start="153.2" dur="3.58">reached out to attorney</text>
  <text start="154.4" dur="5.26">Todd McMurtry who&amp;#39;s representing</text>
  <text start="156.78" dur="4.59">bit burning calm a campaign to end</text>
  <text start="159.66" dur="3.63">digital book burning or online</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="4.17">censorship and I asked him for a</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="5.85">response to this argument that private</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="6.9">companies are immune to our rights let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="169.14" dur="5.58">see what he said under the law as it</text>
  <text start="172.44" dur="4.14">currently stands social media platforms</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="3.78">are not subject to the First Amendment&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="176.58" dur="3.48">guarantee that government not infringe</text>
  <text start="178.5" dur="4.41">on a person&amp;#39;s rights to freedom of</text>
  <text start="180.06" dur="5.07">speech arguably as private companies</text>
  <text start="182.91" dur="5.34">these arguments do not apply to social</text>
  <text start="185.13" dur="4.89">media companies and platforms but there</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="3.69">are currently a number of substantive</text>
  <text start="190.02" dur="3.63">lawsuits against social media companies</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="5.1">that seek to have a course to clear them</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="5.52">state actors the argument is that in</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="4.44">certain narrow instances a private</text>
  <text start="199.17" dur="5.01">company can be delegated a governing</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="5.25">authority or can grow into the role and</text>
  <text start="204.18" dur="3.84">in those instances the private company</text>
  <text start="206.73" dur="4.02">will be required to adhere to</text>
  <text start="208.02" dur="4.62">constitutional standards the question is</text>
  <text start="210.75" dur="5.489">whether or not a platform has become a</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="7.29">state actor ultimately I suspect the US</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="5.521">Supreme Court will decide this issue so</text>
  <text start="219.93" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s always other arguments to be</text>
  <text start="221.76" dur="4.229">made as well including tortious</text>
  <text start="223.89" dur="4.14">interference antitrust or</text>
  <text start="225.989" dur="5.041">anti-competitive monopolistic practices</text>
  <text start="228.03" dur="5.25">and it goes on I mean it could even be a</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="3.51">discrimination case for example many</text>
  <text start="233.28" dur="3.12">states have made it illegal to</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="4.38">discriminate against employees for</text>
  <text start="236.4" dur="4.47">example based on who they voted for or</text>
  <text start="238.92" dur="4.47">their political ideology especially</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="4.649">known now in the time of Trump and all</text>
  <text start="243.39" dur="4.14">this political division so these issues</text>
  <text start="245.519" dur="3.78">are being explored now in a way that</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="3.929">they weren&amp;#39;t before and I think that we</text>
  <text start="249.299" dur="3.391">can finally see some relief from the</text>
  <text start="251.459" dur="2.731">course which is something that we should</text>
  <text start="252.69" dur="4.229">all hope for and maybe some</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="4.59">clarification for society as a whole of</text>
  <text start="256.919" dur="4.531">course there&amp;#39;s also one other thing we</text>
  <text start="258.78" dur="4.139">should mention and that is if indeed</text>
  <text start="261.45" dur="4.8">we&amp;#39;re going for this state actors</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="5.011">approach as Todd McMurtry said what</text>
  <text start="266.25" dur="4.38">evidence might we have that these are</text>
  <text start="267.93" dur="4.29">state actors and one example and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="4.99">remember the case off the top of my head</text>
  <text start="272.22" dur="5.05">was a company talent scenario where</text>
  <text start="275.62" dur="3.03">than he owns the entire town it was like</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="4.95">a coal town or something back in the day</text>
  <text start="278.65" dur="5.25">and unfortunately for the town there was</text>
  <text start="282.22" dur="5.16">a lone creature that stood outside the</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="6.15">bar and spoke his religion his message</text>
  <text start="287.38" dur="5.28">trying to I guess save some Souls at the</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="5.07">bar now despite it being a company town</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="7.44">and company streets company bar company</text>
  <text start="295.12" dur="8.28">beer the right of this preacher to speak</text>
  <text start="300.1" dur="4.89">his message was upheld because in that</text>
  <text start="303.4" dur="4.32">instance it was declared to be a state</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="3.99">actor one could also make the argument</text>
  <text start="307.72" dur="3">that many of these companies are</text>
  <text start="308.98" dur="3.81">becoming state actors simply by the</text>
  <text start="310.72" dur="4.86">virtue of being monopolistic practices</text>
  <text start="312.79" dur="5.55">that are in bed with our government for</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="6.24">funding even a case in point being</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="7.05">project life log and in February 4th Oh</text>
  <text start="321.82" dur="6.69">for the day that Facebook started let me</text>
  <text start="325.39" dur="5.28">describe project life log for you run by</text>
  <text start="328.51" dur="5.01">DARPA the Defense Department&amp;#39;s research</text>
  <text start="330.67" dur="4.35">arm life log aimed to gather in a single</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="4.38">place just about everything an</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="5.79">individual says sees or does the phone</text>
  <text start="337.9" dur="5.43">calls made the TV shows watched the</text>
  <text start="340.81" dur="5.31">magazine&amp;#39;s read the plane tickets bought</text>
  <text start="343.33" dur="4.49">the email sent and received out of this</text>
  <text start="346.12" dur="3.54">seemingly endless ocean of information</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="3.7">computer scientists would plot</text>
  <text start="349.66" dur="3.9">distinctive routes in the data mapping</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="6.36">relationships memories events and</text>
  <text start="353.56" dur="7.14">experiences now DARPA shut down project</text>
  <text start="357.88" dur="4.56">life log but isn&amp;#39;t that exactly what</text>
  <text start="360.7" dur="3.03">Facebook is doing now I mean they</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="3.36">tracked him even if you&amp;#39;ve never had an</text>
  <text start="363.73" dur="3.99">account and they&amp;#39;ve been busted many</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="4.17">times selling out our information and</text>
  <text start="367.72" dur="5.9">everything else so corruption of bounds</text>
  <text start="369.97" dur="3.65">and these questions deserve answers</text>
  <text start="374.01" dur="5.32">argument number two conservatives are</text>
  <text start="377.23" dur="3.9">more edgy they break the rules more</text>
  <text start="379.33" dur="5.19">often and therefore deserve to be</text>
  <text start="381.13" dur="5.55">censored for those who have been around</text>
  <text start="384.52" dur="4.53">on social media for the last few years</text>
  <text start="386.68" dur="3.87">this may ring a little hollow after all</text>
  <text start="389.05" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;ve seen the censorship you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="390.55" dur="3.78">probably experienced it yourself if</text>
  <text start="392.59" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;ve spoken out on any political issue</text>
  <text start="394.33" dur="7.66">that doesn&amp;#39;t lean toward the mainstream</text>
  <text start="397.3" dur="7.48">official right think version now some</text>
  <text start="401.99" dur="5.79">examples for one are Mitch McConnell</text>
  <text start="404.78" dur="6.39">being banned or censored temporarily</text>
  <text start="407.78" dur="5.91">from Twitter his account frozen where he</text>
  <text start="411.17" dur="6.15">was unable to continue to communicate</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="5.1">with people and why well he was told it</text>
  <text start="417.32" dur="4.2">was because he had posted violent</text>
  <text start="418.79" dur="7.14">rhetoric and in reality let&amp;#39;s see what</text>
  <text start="421.52" dur="7.05">really happened Twitter had allowed the</text>
  <text start="425.93" dur="5.67">hashtag massacre Mitch to trend over the</text>
  <text start="428.57" dur="5.93">weekend but quote locked our accounts</text>
  <text start="431.6" dur="7.5">for posting actual threats against us</text>
  <text start="434.5" dur="6.67">and quote now this was in response to</text>
  <text start="439.1" dur="5.58">people throwing up</text>
  <text start="441.17" dur="5.07">let&amp;#39;s kill Mitch kind of party I guess</text>
  <text start="444.68" dur="2.96">if you will in the streets outside of</text>
  <text start="446.24" dur="4.68">his home where they were using</text>
  <text start="447.64" dur="5.44">threatening rhetoric and stabbing voodoo</text>
  <text start="450.92" dur="4.29">dolls and things of that nature and</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="5.25">there does seem to be a double standard</text>
  <text start="455.21" dur="5.31">occurring for example Twitter didn&amp;#39;t ban</text>
  <text start="458.33" dur="6.69">aunty Fez account even after making</text>
  <text start="460.52" dur="8.28">threats against Ted Cruz interesting and</text>
  <text start="465.02" dur="7.05">of course the examples go on and on and</text>
  <text start="468.8" dur="5.01">on including the verified hate that</text>
  <text start="472.07" dur="4.47">comes out of Twitter where there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="473.81" dur="5.64">non-stop stream of anti white anti-trump</text>
  <text start="476.54" dur="6.14">anti conservative hate that just never</text>
  <text start="479.45" dur="3.23">seems to get the banhammer</text>
  <text start="483.37" dur="5.38">frankly it feels like being conservative</text>
  <text start="486.14" dur="4.35">is the opposite of being more edgy we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="488.75" dur="3.45">trying to conserve things we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="490.49" dur="4.38">trying to necessarily push the</text>
  <text start="492.2" dur="4.68">boundaries we&amp;#39;re trying to push back but</text>
  <text start="494.87" dur="5.22">fair point that I guess that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="496.88" dur="4.56">political opinion however certainly the</text>
  <text start="500.09" dur="2.76">mainstream media would have you believe</text>
  <text start="501.44" dur="3.63">in big tech would have you believe that</text>
  <text start="502.85" dur="4.92">conservatives are far more violent right</text>
  <text start="505.07" dur="4.59">not really there&amp;#39;s almost no reported</text>
  <text start="507.77" dur="4.769">incidents of actual Trump supporters</text>
  <text start="509.66" dur="4.439">doing violence and it seems like when</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="3.361">there is there&amp;#39;s always some sort of</text>
  <text start="514.099" dur="3.201">like mysterious thing that happened that</text>
  <text start="515.9" dur="3.9">doesn&amp;#39;t quite make sense for example</text>
  <text start="517.3" dur="4.45">someone goes and shoots up a school and</text>
  <text start="519.8" dur="4.26">then later on upload something on HN</text>
  <text start="521.75" dur="4.16">where it didn&amp;#39;t really make sense</text>
  <text start="524.06" dur="4.46">especially because it happened</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="5.13">the fact examples like that so always</text>
  <text start="528.52" dur="4.23">look for context but without giving you</text>
  <text start="531.04" dur="3.87">too much context because it would take</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="4.29">forever literally with all the leftist</text>
  <text start="534.91" dur="4.95">violence going on check this out</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="5.19">this is a rap sheet on Breitbart calm</text>
  <text start="539.86" dur="5.06">where they actually track violence from</text>
  <text start="542.23" dur="5.64">leftist against Trump supporters and</text>
  <text start="544.92" dur="4.84">usually it&amp;#39;s somewhat media approved</text>
  <text start="547.87" dur="4.83">remember hashtag hunt Republicans</text>
  <text start="549.76" dur="4.14">remember Rand Paul Steve Scalise and</text>
  <text start="552.7" dur="3.71">many others who&amp;#39;ve been either</text>
  <text start="553.9" dur="6.33">threatened intimidated or hurt</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="5.98">physically if not almost killed Rand</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="4.05">Paul had to go through lung surgery if I</text>
  <text start="562.39" dur="4.43">believe in Steve Scalise of course was</text>
  <text start="564.28" dur="5.28">shot numerous times and barely survived</text>
  <text start="566.82" dur="6.67">these big tech censorship happening to</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="6.48">conservatives at all yes but not in the</text>
  <text start="573.49" dur="4.02">way that you&amp;#39;ve been told I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="576.04" dur="4.2">there&amp;#39;s conservative censorship on</text>
  <text start="577.51" dur="4.8">YouTube specifically but I do think at</text>
  <text start="580.24" dur="4.2">the very least bias against</text>
  <text start="582.31" dur="4.53">conservatives exists on Facebook and</text>
  <text start="584.44" dur="3.93">certainly on Twitter although there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="586.84" dur="4.08">way to test the validity of these claims</text>
  <text start="588.37" dur="5.46">a former Facebook insider who was</text>
  <text start="590.92" dur="4.68">interviewed by Project Veritas said the</text>
  <text start="593.83" dur="4.14">social media giant has allegedly</text>
  <text start="595.6" dur="4.44">developed an entire set of tools that it</text>
  <text start="597.97" dur="4.29">frequently uses to suppress conservative</text>
  <text start="600.04" dur="5.04">voices and target outspoken right</text>
  <text start="602.26" dur="4.5">leaning users I do believe these claims</text>
  <text start="605.08" dur="3.57">are a bit sketchy</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="4.53">especially according to the data I</text>
  <text start="608.65" dur="4.77">previously cited on right-leaning</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="4.92">Facebook pages outperforming left-wing</text>

  <text start="625.09" dur="3.24">a little later on when we address the</text>

  <text start="1269.69" dur="2.22">of all of them is the worst because</text>
  <text start="1271.22" dur="3.24">Twitter</text>
  <text start="1271.91" dur="5.88">I mean Twitter is ridiculous all right I</text>
  <text start="1274.46" dur="5.67">think that that concern if anywhere</text>
  <text start="1277.79" dur="5.43">conservative bias exists it&amp;#39;s on Twitter</text>
  <text start="1280.13" dur="6.27">but not on YouTube argument number six</text>
  <text start="1283.22" dur="5.82">not in YouTube&amp;#39;s best interest to censor</text>
  <text start="1286.4" dur="5.29">conservatives</text>
  <text start="1289.04" dur="4.3">now I have somewhat addressed this</text>
  <text start="1291.69" dur="3.15">article because Google is clearly</text>
  <text start="1293.34" dur="3.48">willing to lose quite a bit of money to</text>
  <text start="1294.84" dur="3.9">enforce this new algorithm change that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1296.82" dur="4.34">made them a lot less popular on YouTube</text>
  <text start="1298.74" dur="4.95">even seventy billion dollars in a day</text>
  <text start="1301.16" dur="5.23">but there&amp;#39;s also another route that I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1303.69" dur="5.07">like to explore and explain and that is</text>
  <text start="1306.39" dur="4.74">perhaps it&amp;#39;s not in their best economic</text>
  <text start="1308.76" dur="5.31">interests in that there is logic to that</text>
  <text start="1311.13" dur="4.77">because they lose money however it is I</text>
  <text start="1314.07" dur="3.54">would argue in their best political</text>
  <text start="1315.9" dur="4.11">interest and companies donate billions</text>
  <text start="1317.61" dur="4.199">of dollars to politics it&amp;#39;s nothing new</text>
  <text start="1320.01" dur="3.39">so I think this is a very important</text>
  <text start="1321.809" dur="4.201">Avenue that people should explore</text>
  <text start="1323.4" dur="7.05">clearly some people hate Trump enough to</text>
  <text start="1326.01" dur="7.71">spend money oh and I nearly forgot to</text>

  <text start="1338.37" dur="3.66">actually have nonpartisan influencers</text>
  <text start="1340.44" dur="2.76">from both sides of the aisle standing</text>
  <text start="1342.03" dur="3.33">against censorship because they</text>
  <text start="1343.2" dur="4.65">personally have been affected it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1345.36" dur="4.199">just conservatives it&amp;#39;s independence and</text>
  <text start="1347.85" dur="4.29">that means anyone who stands against the</text>
  <text start="1349.559" dur="5.401">system and their official thought and</text>
  <text start="1352.14" dur="4.32">their official dogma and that means</text>
  <text start="1354.96" dur="4.11">people from both sides of the aisle</text>

  <text start="1422.96" dur="5.59">Media Matters a left-leaning</text>
  <text start="1425.07" dur="5.91">organization tracked 463 Facebook pages</text>

  <text start="1470.79" dur="4.11">I would argue were as bad as CNN if not</text>
  <text start="1473.01" dur="4.53">worse in terms of being fake news media</text>

  <text start="1484.62" dur="3.87">I understand that many people say</text>
  <text start="1486.27" dur="4.05">conservatives are being censored but</text>
  <text start="1488.49" dur="3.9">it&amp;#39;s more nuanced than that it&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="1490.32" dur="3.78">on both sides of the aisle primarily</text>
  <text start="1492.39" dur="3.66">conservatives because there&amp;#39;s more of us</text>
