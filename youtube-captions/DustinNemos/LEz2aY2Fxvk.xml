  <text start="84.03" dur="3.06">guys already know there&amp;#39;s been a witch</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="2.79">hunt for multiple years now we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="87.09" dur="3.18">the whole Trump rush in collusion</text>
  <text start="88.229" dur="4.261">delusion Pelosi has been sort of a</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="4.26">leading figure within that whole you</text>
  <text start="92.49" dur="4.35">know realm the whole time but just</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="4.11">recently just a few things that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="96.84" dur="4.199">done in recent time in this whole</text>
  <text start="98.64" dur="4.38">Ukraine whistleblower witch hunt that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.039" dur="3.571">just as false not even a real</text>
  <text start="103.02" dur="3.629">whistleblower and they had to change the</text>
  <text start="104.61" dur="4.77">rules we&amp;#39;re gonna dive into that too but</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="6.061">basically the idea here is that Pelosi</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="4.849">is setting herself up for treasonous you</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="3.749">know charges I mean she&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="114.229" dur="4.271">changing the rules to try to impeach</text>
  <text start="116.459" dur="4.291">falsely a sitting president what else is</text>
  <text start="118.5" dur="4.2">that if not treason so we have here</text>
  <text start="120.75" dur="4.649">Pelosi and Schiff and probably not just</text>
  <text start="122.7" dur="4.529">them updated the house impeachment</text>
  <text start="125.399" dur="3.301">process they actually changed the rules</text>
  <text start="127.229" dur="3.45">so that it&amp;#39;d be easier to go after</text>
  <text start="128.7" dur="3.899">someone unfairly obviously or they</text>
  <text start="130.679" dur="3.78">wouldn&amp;#39;t have to change the rules like</text>
  <text start="132.599" dur="4.11">President Trump so this was on August</text>
  <text start="134.459" dur="4.081">12th 2019 the same day that the</text>
  <text start="136.709" dur="4.261">whistleblower supposedly whistleblower</text>
  <text start="138.54" dur="4.83">complaint was received I prefer the word</text>
  <text start="140.97" dur="5.37">spy because that&amp;#39;s what he really is not</text>
  <text start="143.37" dur="4.679">truly a whistleblower at all now at the</text>
  <text start="146.34" dur="3.81">same time we also have the Intel</text>
  <text start="148.049" dur="5.041">community inspector general stonewalling</text>
  <text start="150.15" dur="4.53">Congress and refuses to explain why he</text>
  <text start="153.09" dur="4.56">backdated secret changes to the</text>
  <text start="154.68" dur="5.01">whistleblower form and also we have</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="4.77">President Trump saying hey she&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="5.73">traitor says that she may be guilty of</text>
  <text start="162.42" dur="4.92">treason so Nancy Pelosi knew of all of</text>
  <text start="165.42" dur="4.23">the many shifty Adam Schiff lies and</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="4.38">massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress</text>
  <text start="169.65" dur="3.839">and the American people Trump said on</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="4.739">Twitter referring of course to Adam</text>
  <text start="173.489" dur="5.941">Schiff he also said a little further</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="5.4">down this makes nervous Nancy every bit</text>
  <text start="179.43" dur="6.33">as guilty as little Adam Schiff for high</text>
  <text start="181.859" dur="4.71">crimes and misdemeanors even treason so</text>
  <text start="185.76" dur="2.19">there we go</text>
  <text start="186.569" dur="4.29">I just wanted Eve you guys a quick</text>
  <text start="187.95" dur="4.95">update on Pelosi herself the queen of</text>
  <text start="190.859" dur="4.35">mean over there with the Democrats and</text>
  <text start="192.9" dur="5.429">on the way out it seems in terms of</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="5.041">power you know a little context from the</text>
  <text start="198.329" dur="3.621">cult q and on and last couple of years</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="4.139">movement the Magra movement itself</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="4.33">Pelosi was left in power by Trump</text>
  <text start="204.389" dur="3.96">intentionally on purpose because she was</text>
  <text start="206.28" dur="3.69">a weak leader he actually got her the</text>
  <text start="208.349" dur="3.141">votes that she needed or promised to do</text>
  <text start="209.97" dur="2.93">so if she needed them</text>
  <text start="211.49" dur="4.47">from the house in order to make sure</text>
  <text start="212.9" dur="5.79">that she kept power why is that</text>
  <text start="215.96" dur="4.74">of course because she&amp;#39;s a useful</text>
  <text start="218.69" dur="3.99">opponent she&amp;#39;s a fool and she&amp;#39;s weak and</text>
  <text start="220.7" dur="3.63">Trump knew that that&amp;#39;s exactly the</text>
  <text start="222.68" dur="3.48">person that you want running the enemy</text>
  <text start="224.33" dur="4.62">camp the enemy forces</text>
  <text start="226.16" dur="4.41">so Pelosi was not their best general not</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="3.93">their best choice but Trump wanted her</text>
  <text start="230.57" dur="4.08">to stay there because he knew that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="232.88" dur="3.66">predictable and he knew that he could</text>
  <text start="234.65" dur="4.38">beat her because of all the dirt all the</text>
  <text start="236.54" dur="4.2">corruption all the evil going on so this</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="3.36">is an interesting turnabout we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="240.74" dur="3.72">finally starting to see that witch-hunt</text>
  <text start="242.39" dur="4.65">go the other way which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="244.46" dur="3.75">fair they&amp;#39;ve spent years illegally doing</text>
  <text start="247.04" dur="3">everything that they could to try to</text>
  <text start="248.21" dur="3.72">destroy this president this man in this</text>
  <text start="250.04" dur="3.27">country now we&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="251.93" dur="3.12">exploring the other side of the argument</text>
  <text start="253.31" dur="3.27">we&amp;#39;re gonna start investigating the</text>
  <text start="255.05" dur="4.2">investigators and we&amp;#39;re gonna get to the</text>
  <text start="256.58" dur="4.23">bottom of this and some people will be</text>
  <text start="259.25" dur="3.42">held accountable they will be held</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="3.87">responsible through the legal justice</text>
  <text start="262.67" dur="2.61">system and they will be found as</text>
  <text start="264.68" dur="2.55">traitors</text>
  <text start="265.28" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m thinking that&amp;#39;s where</text>
  <text start="267.23" dur="3.57">the the trends seem to be heading that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="269.3" dur="3.84">the cue non-movement warning of the</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="4.02">justice phase I mean all of these things</text>
  <text start="273.14" dur="3.12">and even if you don&amp;#39;t believe in cue or</text>
  <text start="274.82" dur="3.24">even if you don&amp;#39;t like Trump you should</text>
  <text start="276.26" dur="3.45">be able to see the patterns here there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="278.06" dur="4.32">a lot of historical precedents where</text>
  <text start="279.71" dur="4.77">leaders were able to actually change</text>
  <text start="282.38" dur="4.98">things around and throw off a create a</text>
  <text start="284.48" dur="4.41">revolution in this case a non-violent</text>
  <text start="287.36" dur="3.15">revolution for the most part obviously</text>
  <text start="288.89" dur="3.81">and there has been a lot of antiva</text>
  <text start="290.51" dur="3.6">violence on conservatives but for the</text>
  <text start="292.7" dur="3.96">most part this has been a digital</text>
  <text start="294.11" dur="4.62">revolution of war of digital soldiers if</text>
  <text start="296.66" dur="3.45">you will communicating the truth not</text>
  <text start="298.73" dur="3.09">having to take the kind of risks that</text>
  <text start="300.11" dur="3">our forefathers took to save this</text>
  <text start="301.82" dur="3.24">country from the British where they</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="4.08">would go out and and live in misery and</text>
  <text start="305.06" dur="4.14">swamps and hopefully not starve to death</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="4.71">or die of disease with a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="309.2" dur="4.98">other guys that were trying to fight for</text>
