  <text start="38.76" dur="2.97">this is gonna be our news brief for this</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="1.889">morning there are a few things to go</text>
  <text start="41.73" dur="2.97">over</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="6.511">one is the pushback from prosecutors</text>
  <text start="44.7" dur="7.05">over anti-abortion laws also the Mexico</text>
  <text start="48.75" dur="5.579">tariffs have been hereby suspended</text>
  <text start="51.75" dur="5.91">indefinitely as a result of Mexico</text>
  <text start="54.329" dur="5.601">foldings president Trump also a former</text>
  <text start="57.66" dur="5.6">narcotic agent has been charged with</text>
  <text start="59.93" dur="7.17">money laundering of drug proceeds and</text>
  <text start="63.26" dur="6.76">Ilhan Omar is being accused of tax fraud</text>
  <text start="67.1" dur="4.6">so let&amp;#39;s get into this this first one</text>
  <text start="70.02" dur="4.2">here is from msn.com</text>
  <text start="71.7" dur="6.059">this is over 40 prosecutors refused to</text>
  <text start="74.22" dur="5.25">enforce new anti-abortion laws dozens of</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="3.841">state and local prosecutors released a</text>
  <text start="79.47" dur="3.87">statement Friday vowing not to enforce</text>
  <text start="81.6" dur="3.65">extreme anti-abortion restrictions</text>
  <text start="83.34" dur="4.08">recently passed in their states as</text>
  <text start="85.25" dur="4.06">elected prosecutors with charging</text>
  <text start="87.42" dur="3.9">discretion we choose not to prosecute</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="4.019">individuals pursuant to these deeply</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="4.409">concerning laws reads the statement</text>
  <text start="93.329" dur="4.83">issued by fair and just prosecution an</text>
  <text start="95.729" dur="5.191">advocacy group whose members include</text>
  <text start="98.159" dur="5.701">local prosecutors statement is signed by</text>
  <text start="100.92" dur="5.07">42 elected officials including 12 state</text>
  <text start="103.86" dur="4.469">attorneys general the signers represent</text>
  <text start="105.99" dur="5.699">jurisdictions in 24 states including</text>
  <text start="108.329" dur="5.011">Georgia Alabama Texas and Ohio which are</text>
  <text start="111.689" dur="3.991">among those that have recently passed a</text>
  <text start="113.34" dur="4.919">proposed laws sharply restricting or</text>
  <text start="115.68" dur="4.619">outright banning abortion they said</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="4.29">quote to fulfill our obligations as</text>
  <text start="120.299" dur="3.991">prosecutors and ministers of justice to</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="4.021">preserve the integrity of the system and</text>
  <text start="124.29" dur="3.93">keep our communities safe and healthy it</text>
  <text start="126.57" dur="3.809">is imperative that we use our discretion</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="4.53">to decline to prosecute personal health</text>
  <text start="130.379" dur="4.021">care choices criminalized under such</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="6.45">laws and</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="8.5">so this is really important because</text>
  <text start="139.2" dur="7.27">lawmakers prosecute everyone in the</text>
  <text start="142.9" dur="8.399">justice system really has to be on the</text>
  <text start="146.47" dur="7.65">same page because if there are those who</text>
  <text start="151.299" dur="7.321">are not enforcing laws that have been</text>
  <text start="154.12" dur="7.259">created then nobody really has to follow</text>
  <text start="158.62" dur="6.149">that and then you just have a lawless</text>
  <text start="161.379" dur="7.14">society so it may not look that way</text>
  <text start="164.769" dur="6.481">right now but this is kind of where it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.519" dur="5.28">headed if you leave it this way you have</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="4.739">to have everyone on the same page</text>
  <text start="173.799" dur="4.44">you have to enforce laws even if you</text>
  <text start="175.989" dur="5.551">don&amp;#39;t like it even if you don&amp;#39;t agree</text>
  <text start="178.239" dur="6.83">with that law you have if it&amp;#39;s your job</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="7.259">to enforce a law or to prosecute someone</text>
  <text start="185.069" dur="5.741">it in regards to that law that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="188.799" dur="6.33">your job is that&amp;#39;s what you have to do</text>
  <text start="190.81" dur="7.41">because you are the standard and if you</text>
  <text start="195.129" dur="8.19">are not enforcing a law or prosecuting</text>
  <text start="198.22" dur="9.51">over a law or you know just in line with</text>
  <text start="203.319" dur="8.151">that justice system then no one else has</text>
  <text start="207.73" dur="6">to be it&amp;#39;s just like you know when a</text>
  <text start="211.47" dur="3.549">parent does something and they tell</text>
  <text start="213.73" dur="3.96">their kid that they&amp;#39;re not supposed to</text>
  <text start="215.019" dur="4.711">do it and the kid is like well you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.69" dur="4.799">doing it so why can&amp;#39;t I do it there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="219.73" dur="5.119">standard there you know everyone has to</text>
  <text start="222.489" dur="5.22">be on the same page with this now</text>
  <text start="224.849" dur="5.11">granted we have gone through some major</text>
  <text start="227.709" dur="6.301">changes over the last couple of years</text>
  <text start="229.959" dur="8.761">I&amp;#39;m a very very drastic quick rapid</text>
  <text start="234.01" dur="7.259">changes because up until now I think</text>
  <text start="238.72" dur="7.729">that most people have really thought</text>
  <text start="241.269" dur="8.4">that when it came to abortion any</text>
  <text start="246.449" dur="6.88">possibility of passing laws that would</text>
  <text start="249.669" dur="5.671">ban abortion were just fantasy up until</text>
  <text start="253.329" dur="4.171">recently most people thought that this</text>
  <text start="255.34" dur="8.329">wasn&amp;#39;t going to happen I mean Roe vs.</text>
  <text start="257.5" dur="9.54">Wade really protected a woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263.669" dur="5.381">quote/unquote right to kill her child</text>
  <text start="267.04" dur="4.35">and most people upheld that and they</text>
  <text start="269.05" dur="5.4">supported that but now we&amp;#39;re seeing this</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="6.3">shift so especially with the new</text>
  <text start="274.45" dur="4.8">administration and now lawmakers are now</text>
  <text start="277.69" dur="3.48">getting more bold and they&amp;#39;re saying you</text>
  <text start="279.25" dur="3.87">know what I want to stand up for what I</text>
  <text start="281.17" dur="4.05">really believe in which is I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="283.12" dur="4.95">believe we should be killing babies so a</text>
  <text start="285.22" dur="5.91">lot of people are making moves on this</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="6.84">and so there is some pushback at this</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="6">point now when I see something like this</text>
  <text start="294.91" dur="4.05">like I said before you know you have to</text>
  <text start="297.13" dur="5.16">be on the same page and if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="298.96" dur="6.75">you create a lawless Society so this</text>
  <text start="302.29" dur="8.39">something like this really could lead to</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="9.9">a cold if not an outright Civil War</text>
  <text start="310.68" dur="7.66">because you have lawmakers and</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="7.44">prosecutors that are not in line with</text>
  <text start="318.34" dur="9.54">each other okay and so this is going to</text>
  <text start="323.05" dur="8.07">create a major rift in the society so at</text>
  <text start="327.88" dur="6">the very least this could lead to a cold</text>
  <text start="331.12" dur="6.89">civil war which I believe actually we</text>
  <text start="333.88" dur="8.31">may already be in so this is a major</text>
  <text start="338.01" dur="7.84">major thing this is a crisis we cannot</text>
  <text start="342.19" dur="8.18">have prosecutors were refusing to</text>
  <text start="345.85" dur="9.51">enforce laws it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not right</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="8.71">all right so the next one here okay so</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="5.55">this one is also from msn.com mrs. Trump</text>
  <text start="359.08" dur="6.72">calls off tariffs on Mexico after deal</text>
  <text start="360.91" dur="7.5">on migration u.s. president Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="365.8" dur="4.14">said on Friday that Mexico&amp;#39;s government</text>
  <text start="368.41" dur="3.27">had reached a deal with the u.s. to</text>
  <text start="369.94" dur="3.84">avert a tariff or by pledging to take</text>
  <text start="371.68" dur="4.05">strong measures to contain the migration</text>
  <text start="373.78" dur="3.99">of mostly Central Americans crossing the</text>
  <text start="375.73" dur="4.98">southern US border he had threatened to</text>
  <text start="377.77" dur="5.4">impose 5% import tariffs on all Mexican</text>
  <text start="380.71" dur="3.99">goods from Monday if Mexico did not</text>
  <text start="383.17" dur="3.87">agree to his demands to tighten its</text>
  <text start="384.7" dur="4.77">borders his announcement of a deal came</text>
  <text start="387.04" dur="5.28">after three days of Mexico us</text>
  <text start="389.47" dur="4.62">negotiations in Washington he said quote</text>
  <text start="392.32" dur="4.11">the tariff scheduled to be implemented</text>
  <text start="394.09" dur="4.68">by the US on Monday against Mexico are</text>
  <text start="396.43" dur="6.64">hereby indefinitely suspended</text>
  <text start="398.77" dur="5.83">in Mexico intern has agreed to take</text>
  <text start="403.07" dur="3.93">strong measures to stem the tide of</text>
  <text start="404.6" dur="4.35">migration through Mexico and to our</text>
  <text start="407" dur="3.93">southern border this is being done to</text>
  <text start="408.95" dur="4.14">greatly reduce or eliminate illegal</text>
  <text start="410.93" dur="7.74">immigration coming from Mexico and into</text>
  <text start="413.09" dur="8.4">the u.s. so he had announced recently on</text>
  <text start="418.67" dur="5.7">Monday that he was going to impose five</text>
  <text start="421.49" dur="7.01">percent tariffs and not only that but it</text>
  <text start="424.37" dur="7.47">was going to increase incrementally</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="8.05">until it reached up to twenty five</text>
  <text start="431.84" dur="6.84">percent so at that point I think Mexico</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="5.67">decided that it wasn&amp;#39;t gonna be able to</text>
  <text start="438.68" dur="5.4">take a twenty five percent tariff and so</text>
  <text start="442.22" dur="4.86">they just decided they needed to go</text>
  <text start="444.08" dur="5.7">along with what President Trump was</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="5.49">saying so which actually again but it</text>
  <text start="449.78" dur="6.68">benefits them too because like I was</text>
  <text start="452.57" dur="6.81">saying yesterday a president Trump is</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="6.16">refusing to let these illegals into our</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="6.9">country and so then what happens is that</text>
  <text start="462.62" dur="6.15">you have all of these migrants who are</text>
  <text start="466.28" dur="5.76">stuck on the border and they&amp;#39;re stuck on</text>
  <text start="468.77" dur="5.88">the Mexico side so you would think that</text>
  <text start="472.04" dur="4.41">Mexico would want these people not to</text>
  <text start="474.65" dur="5.22">come into the country in the first place</text>
  <text start="476.45" dur="5.31">because now they&amp;#39;re stuck there in their</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="3.21">country they have all of these people</text>
  <text start="481.76" dur="3.6">and they don&amp;#39;t have the resources to</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="3.87">take care of them because we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="485.36" dur="4.67">sending the resources to take care of</text>
  <text start="486.95" dur="5.34">them as long as they&amp;#39;re on that side so</text>
  <text start="490.03" dur="4.96">you know you would think it would be in</text>
  <text start="492.29" dur="4.41">their interest anyway to not have these</text>
  <text start="494.99" dur="3.179">people across the border because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.7" dur="4.23">not gonna make it over here</text>
  <text start="498.169" dur="6.031">although a few have made it over here</text>
  <text start="500.93" dur="7.62">for the most part president Trump has</text>
  <text start="504.2" dur="7.35">done a lot to make sure that that influx</text>
  <text start="508.55" dur="6.72">doesn&amp;#39;t flood into our country so that</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="6">is a good thing so now Mexico is saying</text>
  <text start="515.27" dur="4.56">okay we&amp;#39;re ready to work with you</text>
  <text start="517.55" dur="5.039">because we don&amp;#39;t want to feel the</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="5.16">economic pinch of these huge tariffs</text>
  <text start="522.589" dur="4.921">that you know he&amp;#39;s definitely going to</text>
  <text start="524.99" dur="5.399">impose cuz the thing is when it comes to</text>
  <text start="527.51" dur="4.53">President Trump he means what he says</text>
  <text start="530.389" dur="3.24">when he says he&amp;#39;s going to do something</text>
  <text start="532.04" dur="3.63">he will do it it&amp;#39;s not like you know</text>
  <text start="533.629" dur="5.99">years ago when President President Obama</text>
  <text start="535.67" dur="7.56">I even hate saying that sir but Obama</text>
  <text start="539.619" dur="6.101">had drawn the red line he said this is</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="6.859">the red line with Syria and then when</text>
  <text start="545.72" dur="8.549">they crossed it he did nothing that was</text>
  <text start="550.089" dur="9.37">really bad for our country really bad</text>
  <text start="554.269" dur="12.06">because then the other countries really</text>
  <text start="559.459" dur="9.24">saw how weak he was and how he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="566.329" dur="3.36">fall through with his threats that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="568.699" dur="2.73">they were they were thought they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.689" dur="5.87">even promises they were it was a threat</text>
  <text start="571.429" dur="6.78">it was a bluff and so but with Trump</text>
  <text start="575.559" dur="4.99">that&amp;#39;s not the case when he says</text>
  <text start="578.209" dur="6.211">something he means it and so Mexico</text>
  <text start="580.549" dur="6.84">knows this they&amp;#39;re not willing to have</text>
  <text start="584.42" dur="5.099">an economic downturn due to these</text>
  <text start="587.389" dur="4.11">tariffs so they are now going to</text>
  <text start="589.519" dur="6.75">cooperate on immigration so that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="591.499" dur="8.28">good thing okay also in immigration we</text>
  <text start="596.269" dur="6.72">have Venezuelans there are millions of</text>
  <text start="599.779" dur="6.18">refugees from Venezuela and this of</text>
  <text start="602.989" dur="7.56">course is because Venezuela is a</text>
  <text start="605.959" dur="7.141">disaster this country is a disaster this</text>
  <text start="610.549" dur="5.58">is the perfect example of why socialism</text>
  <text start="613.1" dur="7.56">does not work Venezuela was one of the</text>
  <text start="616.129" dur="8.7">richest countries and then they imposed</text>
  <text start="620.66" dur="6.45">all of these socialist policies and then</text>
  <text start="624.829" dur="5.19">they ran out of money you cannot give</text>
  <text start="627.11" dur="4.11">out all kinds of free stuff and think</text>
  <text start="630.019" dur="2.88">that you&amp;#39;re gonna support yourself</text>
  <text start="631.22" dur="5.19">you&amp;#39;re not going to you&amp;#39;re gonna end up</text>
  <text start="632.899" dur="7.44">with empty pockets so that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="636.41" dur="5.459">happened here Venezuela cannot feed its</text>
  <text start="640.339" dur="5.011">own people</text>
  <text start="641.869" dur="6.421">they can&amp;#39;t even refine their own wheel</text>
  <text start="645.35" dur="4.589">they are sitting on the big the head of</text>
  <text start="648.29" dur="3.539">the most oil but they can&amp;#39;t refine it</text>
  <text start="649.939" dur="2.37">because they don&amp;#39;t have the resources to</text>
  <text start="651.829" dur="2.7">do so</text>
  <text start="652.309" dur="4.65">that is how poor they are they are</text>
  <text start="654.529" dur="5.131">really poor and this is why you know</text>
  <text start="656.959" dur="5.16">people should be really afraid of any</text>
  <text start="659.66" dur="3.46">president who wants to impose socialist</text>
  <text start="662.119" dur="4.421">policies</text>
  <text start="663.12" dur="5.61">Bernie Sanders anyway so this one is</text>

  <text start="898.69" dur="4.17">facing upheaval but speaking to</text>
  <text start="901" dur="4.35">reporters later Tuesday he poured cold</text>
  <text start="902.86" dur="4.02">water on the idea of Japan opening his</text>
  <text start="905.35" dur="3.78">doors to this play and he said quote I</text>
  <text start="906.88" dur="4.41">would say that before accepting</text>
  <text start="909.13" dur="4.44">immigrants or refugees we need to have</text>
  <text start="911.29" dur="4.5">more activities by women by elderly</text>
  <text start="913.57" dur="4.23">people and he must raise the birthrate</text>
  <text start="915.79" dur="4.5">there are many things that we should do</text>
  <text start="917.8" dur="4.74">before accepting immigrants he added</text>
  <text start="920.29" dur="3.9">that Japan would discharge their own</text>
  <text start="922.54" dur="3.66">responsibilities in addressing the</text>
  <text start="924.19" dur="3.55">refugee crisis which he described as</text>
  <text start="926.2" dur="4.39">helping to improve</text>
  <text start="927.74" dur="4.65">that caused the Exodus he earlier told</text>
  <text start="930.59" dur="4.44">the world body that Japan would provide</text>
  <text start="932.39" dur="4.41">810 million this year former agency</text>
  <text start="935.03" dur="4.52">assistance of refugees and internally</text>
  <text start="936.8" dur="6.3">displaced persons from Syria and Iraq</text>
  <text start="939.55" dur="6.24">triple what he gave last year they pride</text>
  <text start="943.1" dur="5.04">themselves on being good global citizens</text>
  <text start="945.79" dur="5.74">Japan is one of the largest aid donors</text>
  <text start="948.14" dur="7.17">in the world and last year they gave 181</text>
  <text start="951.53" dur="7.44">million dollars to the UNHCR making it</text>
  <text start="955.31" dur="5.78">second only to the US and generosity but</text>
  <text start="958.97" dur="4.5">it has offered very few if any</text>
  <text start="961.09" dur="7.81">resettlement places for refugees from</text>
  <text start="963.47" dur="8.31">civil war in Syria so okay so what is</text>
  <text start="968.9" dur="7.13">saying here is that you know Prime</text>
  <text start="971.78" dur="10.56">Minister Abe is offering a lot of money</text>
  <text start="976.03" dur="8.29">to help assist in these places where</text>
  <text start="982.34" dur="4.62">people are being displaced and to help</text>
  <text start="984.32" dur="5.7">the cause but he&amp;#39;s not willing to take</text>
  <text start="986.96" dur="7.28">on refugees in his own country right so</text>
  <text start="990.02" dur="8.82">he&amp;#39;s willing that to help financially</text>
  <text start="994.24" dur="7.69">from abroad but not give them space in</text>
  <text start="998.84" dur="6.12">his country and that makes sense he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1001.93" dur="4.38">saying you know that they have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1004.96" dur="5.84">things that they need to do with their</text>
  <text start="1006.31" dur="9.87">own citizens which you know is very</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="8.8">practical it&amp;#39;s very noble because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1016.18" dur="5.82">the leader of a country and they have</text>
  <text start="1019.6" dur="4.44">problems within that country and so they</text>
  <text start="1022" dur="4.56">need to handle those first it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1024.04" dur="6">like here you know in the u.s. we have a</text>
  <text start="1026.56" dur="6.21">huge homeless population issue you know</text>
  <text start="1030.04" dur="6.84">and most of those homeless are veterans</text>
  <text start="1032.77" dur="6.75">or mentally ill and you know while we</text>
  <text start="1036.88" dur="5.79">still have hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="1039.52" dur="8.37">these veterans and mentally ill on the</text>
  <text start="1042.67" dur="8.1">streets left mostly to die we have been</text>
  <text start="1047.89" dur="4.47">opening our arms to these people coming</text>
  <text start="1050.77" dur="4.92">in from other countries to take up space</text>
  <text start="1052.36" dur="4.61">that we could use for those people you</text>
  <text start="1055.69" dur="4.52">know we</text>
  <text start="1056.97" dur="5.19">to be handling ourselves before we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1060.21" dur="4.17">ever reaching out to other people to</text>
  <text start="1062.16" dur="4.38">help them you cannot help others if you</text>
  <text start="1064.38" dur="6.99">don&amp;#39;t help yourself first and you know</text>
  <text start="1066.54" dur="8.67">that is just common sense it really is</text>
  <text start="1071.37" dur="7.05">and you&amp;#39;re gonna end up making your</text>
  <text start="1075.21" dur="5.04">citizens really upset when they notice</text>
  <text start="1078.42" dur="4.59">that you are helping others before</text>
  <text start="1080.25" dur="5.28">you&amp;#39;re helping them you know that other</text>
  <text start="1083.01" dur="5.49">people from other countries take</text>
  <text start="1085.53" dur="5.01">priority over your own citizens so Japan</text>
  <text start="1088.5" dur="4.17">here is saying you know hey I&amp;#39;m willing</text>
  <text start="1090.54" dur="3.75">to give you money but I&amp;#39;m not willing to</text>
  <text start="1092.67" dur="3.54">give you space because we have things to</text>
  <text start="1094.29" dur="5.34">do here we have to handle our business</text>
  <text start="1096.21" dur="5.64">first and hey you know props to him for</text>
  <text start="1099.63" dur="4.2">saying that and they can&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1101.85" dur="4.62">criticize him for that you know because</text>
  <text start="1103.83" dur="5.07">he is giving a lot to the cause it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1106.47" dur="5.85">just that he&amp;#39;s giving it in a different</text>
  <text start="1108.9" dur="5.91">way and really it makes sense to try to</text>
  <text start="1112.32" dur="5.16">tackle the issue at the country&amp;#39;s first</text>
  <text start="1114.81" dur="4.56">and of course you know we have been</text>
  <text start="1117.48" dur="4.29">trying to help other countries like</text>
  <text start="1119.37" dur="4.59">Venezuela for example but the leaders</text>
  <text start="1121.77" dur="4.98">there have misappropriated those funds</text>
  <text start="1123.96" dur="5.13">they have abused those funds and so the</text>
  <text start="1126.75" dur="4.23">citizens there don&amp;#39;t need to be angry at</text>
  <text start="1129.09" dur="4.41">the US because we don&amp;#39;t want to take in</text>
  <text start="1130.98" dur="4.62">all of these huge amounts of people but</text>
  <text start="1133.5" dur="4.05">they need to be angry at their leaders</text>
  <text start="1135.6" dur="4.35">because they have been misusing the</text>
  <text start="1137.55" dur="4.38">funds that could that could benefit them</text>
  <text start="1139.95" dur="3.81">that could be used to rebuild their</text>
  <text start="1141.93" dur="6.06">country to make it better to where they</text>
  <text start="1143.76" dur="8.19">don&amp;#39;t have to leave you know perpetual</text>
  <text start="1147.99" dur="6.38">Wars don&amp;#39;t help either so you know these</text>
  <text start="1151.95" dur="5.25">things need to be resolved in their own</text>
  <text start="1154.37" dur="5.14">spaces so then that way the people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1157.2" dur="6.3">have to leave they can just stay you</text>
  <text start="1159.51" dur="6.57">know but good for Japan Japan is not</text>
  <text start="1163.5" dur="7.08">going to take anyone because they have</text>
  <text start="1166.08" dur="7.68">to look after their own first alright so</text>
  <text start="1170.58" dur="5.28">then also in other news we have a former</text>
  <text start="1173.76" dur="4.68">narcotics agent in co-conspirator</text>
  <text start="1175.86" dur="6.41">sentenced in drug proceeds money</text>
  <text start="1178.44" dur="7.65">laundering case so this isn&amp;#39;t surprising</text>
  <text start="1182.27" dur="5.889">we have known for a long time now</text>
  <text start="1186.09" dur="6.329">that there is a ton of corruption</text>
  <text start="1188.159" dur="6.601">especially within the DEA and even more</text>
  <text start="1192.419" dur="6.091">than that so like for example the CIA</text>
  <text start="1194.76" dur="8.97">was involved in iran-contra and they</text>
  <text start="1198.51" dur="9.93">allowed the trafficking of drugs in</text>
  <text start="1203.73" dur="6.75">order to benefit financially from that</text>
  <text start="1208.44" dur="5.88">so they took the funds from that and</text>
  <text start="1210.48" dur="6">they gave it to the Nicaraguans and also</text>
  <text start="1214.32" dur="3.93">lined their own pockets as well with</text>
  <text start="1216.48" dur="3.09">that so this has been going on for a</text>
  <text start="1218.25" dur="3.149">really long time where we have people</text>
  <text start="1219.57" dur="6.709">who were supposed to be enforcing the</text>
  <text start="1221.399" dur="7.321">law and they&amp;#39;re not they are</text>
  <text start="1226.279" dur="5.831">manipulating situations in order to</text>
  <text start="1228.72" dur="6.809">benefit themselves so it&amp;#39;s good to see</text>
  <text start="1232.11" dur="5.03">that people are finally being held</text>
  <text start="1235.529" dur="4.351">accountable for these types of things</text>

  <text start="1467.23" dur="4.71">supports if not proves Omar married her</text>

  <text start="1475.78" dur="4.5">University shortly before Omar was first</text>
  <text start="1478.36" dur="5.13">elected to stay so I think that this is</text>
  <text start="1480.28" dur="7.379">the biggest thing here it&amp;#39;s not that you</text>
  <text start="1483.49" dur="6.059">know she filed legal tax returns which</text>
  <text start="1487.659" dur="4.561">of course that&amp;#39;s bad too you can&amp;#39;t file</text>
  <text start="1489.549" dur="4.26">fraudulent tax returns and oh by the way</text>
  <text start="1492.22" dur="4.199">you know these are the same people who</text>
  <text start="1493.809" dur="5.721">have been screaming about president</text>
  <text start="1496.419" dur="5.49">Trump&amp;#39;s tax returns but you know</text>
  <text start="1499.53" dur="4.66">typically when you&amp;#39;re pointing the</text>
  <text start="1501.909" dur="4.051">finger you have four pointing straight</text>
  <text start="1504.19" dur="4.71">back at cute and in this case that is</text>
  <text start="1505.96" dur="6.42">definitely true so but to me the biggest</text>
  <text start="1508.9" dur="8.279">thing is the immigration fraud here okay</text>
  <text start="1512.38" dur="8.1">because she married her brother in order</text>
  <text start="1517.179" dur="6.331">for him to come here so instead of doing</text>
  <text start="1520.48" dur="7.5">things the legal way the the proper way</text>
  <text start="1523.51" dur="6.419">the legitimate way she decided to work</text>
  <text start="1527.98" dur="5.88">the system in a way that would benefit</text>
  <text start="1529.929" dur="6.48">her so that I think is the biggest thing</text>
  <text start="1533.86" dur="5.58">that she you know committed immigration</text>
  <text start="1536.409" dur="5.341">fraud and frankly I think that she</text>
  <text start="1539.44" dur="4.349">should not be in office because this</text>
  <text start="1541.75" dur="5.25">isn&amp;#39;t the first time so we have</text>
  <text start="1543.789" dur="5.071">immigration fraud we have tax fraud what</text>
  <text start="1547" dur="4.53">more do we need to get this lady out of</text>
  <text start="1548.86" dur="6.6">office you know not to mention the fact</text>
  <text start="1551.53" dur="10.139">that she&amp;#39;s made several comments that</text>
  <text start="1555.46" dur="9.48">are hugely concerning regarding you know</text>
  <text start="1561.669" dur="6.421">terrorist groups and how she takes that</text>
  <text start="1564.94" dur="6.989">very lightly and also her you know</text>
  <text start="1568.09" dur="6.42">anti-israel and she&amp;#39;s Semite comments</text>
  <text start="1571.929" dur="4.771">that she has made and yet she&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="1574.51" dur="3.2">you know Committee for Foreign Affairs</text>
  <text start="1576.7" dur="4.25">like this does</text>
  <text start="1577.71" dur="8.51">make any sense this lady needs to be</text>
  <text start="1580.95" dur="8.13">removed from her position point-blank so</text>
  <text start="1586.22" dur="4.6">hopefully at some point soon they will</text>
  <text start="1589.08" dur="5.64">realize that they need to get her out of</text>
  <text start="1590.82" dur="7.44">office because she has been even if</text>
  <text start="1594.72" dur="4.26">she&amp;#39;s been accused of this this is not</text>
  <text start="1598.26" dur="2.88">good</text>
  <text start="1598.98" dur="4.02">okay this is not good and obviously</text>
  <text start="1601.14" dur="4.159">there&amp;#39;s evidence here that she has done</text>
  <text start="1603" dur="5.789">this so why haven&amp;#39;t they done anything</text>
  <text start="1605.299" dur="5.531">but of course by now we realize that</text>
  <text start="1608.789" dur="6.12">there is different standards when it</text>
  <text start="1610.83" dur="5.76">comes to your affiliated party so if</text>
  <text start="1614.909" dur="3.331">you&amp;#39;re a Republican you have one</text>
  <text start="1616.59" dur="4.02">standard and if you&amp;#39;re a Democrat you</text>
  <text start="1618.24" dur="5.159">have another standard but actually I</text>
  <text start="1620.61" dur="5.36">shouldn&amp;#39;t even say that because you know</text>
  <text start="1623.399" dur="5.91">it&amp;#39;s not even really about party</text>
  <text start="1625.97" dur="6.01">affiliation so much it&amp;#39;s about what team</text>
  <text start="1629.309" dur="6.451">you&amp;#39;re on so you know we have</text>
  <text start="1631.98" dur="8.189">Republicans who are actually you know</text>
  <text start="1635.76" dur="9.63">part of this deep state we call them</text>
  <text start="1640.169" dur="7.26">rhinos or whatever but it has less to do</text>
  <text start="1645.39" dur="5.82">with your party affiliation and more to</text>
  <text start="1647.429" dur="6.511">do with what side of the agenda you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1651.21" dur="4.41">on so because she&amp;#39;s on their side of the</text>
  <text start="1653.94" dur="4.369">agenda she&amp;#39;s gonna get away with all of</text>
  <text start="1655.62" dur="5.929">this and she gets to keep her position</text>
  <text start="1658.309" dur="6.131">hopefully that will change soon</text>
  <text start="1661.549" dur="5.801">speaking of double standards we have</text>
  <text start="1664.44" dur="5.099">this piece from the gateway pundit his</text>
  <text start="1667.35" dur="6.09">FBI Doc&amp;#39;s show Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s lawyer</text>

  <text start="1765.22" dur="6.329">it&amp;#39;s just like with Peter struck and his</text>

  <text start="1789.269" dur="3.461">obviously they&amp;#39;re not going to give you</text>
  <text start="1791.139" dur="2.88">the evidence that is gonna incriminate</text>

  <text start="1794.019" dur="4.65">stupid especially if you if you have the</text>

  <text start="1814.389" dur="4.951">double standard I mean they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1816.34" dur="4.98">about you know Trump obstructed justice</text>
  <text start="1819.34" dur="3.78">he didn&amp;#39;t obstruct anything because</text>
  <text start="1821.32" dur="3.63">there was no crime there</text>
  <text start="1823.12" dur="4.38">you can&amp;#39;t obstruct a crime that you</text>

  <text start="1827.5" dur="4.799">nobody is saying anything there&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1843.409" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s a very obvious obstruction of</text>

  <text start="1859.25" dur="4.74">just really blatant but again like I was</text>
  <text start="1862.07" dur="4.319">just saying is that gonna go there are</text>
