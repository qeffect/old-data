  <text start="8.889" dur="22.65">held back by the most powerful welcome</text>
  <text start="29.349" dur="5.251">back my friends this is destiny most of</text>
  <text start="31.539" dur="4.77">the Nemo&amp;#39;s news network and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="34.6" dur="3">interesting isn&amp;#39;t it this Epstein thing</text>
  <text start="36.309" dur="4.411">just keeps going and going and going</text>
  <text start="37.6" dur="6.54">gets weirder and weirder and weirder of</text>
  <text start="40.72" dur="4.95">course check out nog assurance calm for</text>
  <text start="44.14" dur="3.39">your health insurance needs I want to go</text>
  <text start="45.67" dur="4.83">ahead and plug real fast but let&amp;#39;s live</text>
  <text start="47.53" dur="4.14">it in this I&amp;#39;ve seen stuff because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="50.5" dur="3.03">very strange</text>
  <text start="51.67" dur="3.449">how they they thought that they could</text>
  <text start="53.53" dur="3.48">sort of just get away with this in the</text>
  <text start="55.119" dur="3.481">in the optics or I guess they were just</text>
  <text start="57.01" dur="3.5">so desperate at this point right who</text>
  <text start="58.6" dur="4.769">ever you know orchestrated this</text>
  <text start="60.51" dur="4.719">ultimately because we know he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="63.369" dur="4.351">kill himself and that doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text>
  <text start="65.229" dur="4.621">sense at all so what&amp;#39;s what else is</text>
  <text start="67.72" dur="6.09">coming out we also know now that he kept</text>
  <text start="69.85" dur="6.24">meticulous Diaries ok so he courted the</text>
  <text start="73.81" dur="4.95">rich and powerful so that he can have</text>
  <text start="76.09" dur="4.53">protection apparently and he kept</text>
  <text start="78.76" dur="3.9">Diaries in case he ever needed it so</text>
  <text start="80.62" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s not just courting richer power if</text>
  <text start="82.66" dur="3.29">we had dirt on many of them doing things</text>
  <text start="84.43" dur="6.75">with children things like that on his</text>
  <text start="85.95" dur="7.209">weird temple cult pedo island also</text>
  <text start="91.18" dur="4.14">remember them there was a three story at</text>
  <text start="93.159" dur="4.711">least structure underneath there like a</text>
  <text start="95.32" dur="5.16">dungeon what was going on under there</text>
  <text start="97.87" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s insane so prison employee</text>
  <text start="100.48" dur="5.25">guarding Epstein was not even a</text>
  <text start="102.79" dur="4.32">correctional officer I wonder if we can</text>
  <text start="105.73" dur="4.17">get that person for a manslaughter</text>
  <text start="107.11" dur="5.369">because his actions or whoever did this</text>
  <text start="109.9" dur="4.92">that they could hold culpable probably</text>
  <text start="112.479" dur="4.051">was paid off anyway and manslaughter</text>
  <text start="114.82" dur="4.32">seems pretty appropriate at this point I</text>
  <text start="116.53" dur="4.53">mean accidental you know whatever but</text>
  <text start="119.14" dur="6.93">it&amp;#39;s still your actions led to someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.06" dur="8.28">death directly so we also have dr. mark</text>
  <text start="126.07" dur="4.979">Segal odd that autopsy delayed have</text>
  <text start="129.34" dur="4.35">never seen anyone taken off suicide</text>
  <text start="131.049" dur="5.181">watch in two weeks isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="5.76">interesting</text>
  <text start="136.23" dur="6.22">other conditions like in that Manhattan</text>
  <text start="139.45" dur="4.89">Correctional Center where he died Fox</text>
  <text start="142.45" dur="5.22">medical contributor mark Segal has</text>
  <text start="144.34" dur="6.39">answers to both those questions and more</text>
  <text start="147.67" dur="7.38">let&amp;#39;s just start with this autopsy</text>
  <text start="150.73" dur="6.78">doctor is it unusual for the autopsy to</text>
  <text start="155.05" dur="4.68">be delayed the results of it to be</text>
  <text start="157.51" dur="5.1">delayed as they have been yes it is</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="5.19">unusual and it makes me wonder now the</text>
  <text start="162.61" dur="4.47">medical examiner has reportedly said</text>
  <text start="164.92" dur="5.61">that the cause of death as trace just</text>
  <text start="167.08" dur="6.03">said is hanging but they still have to</text>
  <text start="170.53" dur="4.29">determine exactly how that occurred and</text>
  <text start="173.11" dur="3.06">whether he actually hung himself that</text>
  <text start="174.82" dur="4.5">would be one thing on my mind</text>
  <text start="176.17" dur="4.8">the other thing is suicide is very very</text>
  <text start="179.32" dur="3.45">common in prisons it&amp;#39;s actually the</text>
  <text start="180.97" dur="3.54">number one cause of death in prisons one</text>
  <text start="182.77" dur="3.56">out of three deaths in prisons are</text>
  <text start="184.51" dur="4.92">suicide but this particular facility</text>
  <text start="186.33" dur="4.99">hasn&amp;#39;t had has only had one suicide over</text>
  <text start="189.43" dur="4.2">the past forty years now I&amp;#39;ve been there</text>
  <text start="191.32" dur="3.27">the Metropolitan Correctional Center is</text>
  <text start="193.63" dur="3.09">full of squalor</text>
  <text start="194.59" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s full of vermin it&amp;#39;s a disgusting</text>
  <text start="196.72" dur="5.58">place it is not a pretty place at all</text>
  <text start="199.3" dur="5.13">but the other question that&amp;#39;s come up is</text>
  <text start="202.3" dur="4.59">where were the cameras he was but he was</text>
  <text start="204.43" dur="4.68">moved to special housing where where was</text>
  <text start="206.89" dur="4.47">the observation why wasn&amp;#39;t he being</text>
  <text start="209.11" dur="4.02">observed I can tell you that someone</text>
  <text start="211.36" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s supposedly been on suicide watch</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="5.04">me as a physician no psychiatrist would</text>
  <text start="215.98" dur="4.71">take a person off of suicide watch in</text>
  <text start="218.17" dur="8.1">this kind of condition this sex offender</text>
  <text start="220.69" dur="7.35">I&amp;#39;d watch and then just he&amp;#39;s fine he</text>
  <text start="226.27" dur="4.25">says he&amp;#39;s fine that&amp;#39;s not how a</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="3.9">psychiatrist were basically six-step</text>
  <text start="230.52" dur="4.12">absolutely not</text>
  <text start="231.94" dur="5.1">that makes no sense at all does it he</text>
  <text start="234.64" dur="5.58">was also by the way six foot apparently</text>
  <text start="237.04" dur="6.24">so him hanging from his bed in a prison</text>
  <text start="240.22" dur="5.28">sheet apparently what they&amp;#39;re going with</text>
  <text start="243.28" dur="4.56">just doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense those</text>
  <text start="245.5" dur="4.41">beds aren&amp;#39;t usually very big anyway I</text>
  <text start="247.84" dur="6.03">don&amp;#39;t think so he his feet would be</text>
  <text start="249.91" dur="5.64">tangling as it is who has the willpower</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="3.989">to just sit there and go through that</text>
  <text start="255.55" dur="7.56">and die especially when they have an</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="7.591">appeal coming so now they are</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="5.01">investigating the island a dozen FBI</text>
  <text start="265.45" dur="4.83">agents raid I&amp;#39;ve seen orgies Eileen</text>
  <text start="268.12" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;ve seen orgy Island on Monday after</text>
  <text start="270.28" dur="4.05">his death and remember you know some of</text>
  <text start="272.71" dur="3.3">this evidence has probably been scrubbed</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="3.809">you know we have reason to believe he</text>
  <text start="276.01" dur="5.61">filled in the tunnels with with cement</text>
  <text start="278.139" dur="5.131">and stuff like that but even so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="3.21">probably some stuff there they took some</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="3.93">things out in boxes or they were</text>
  <text start="284.83" dur="5.64">covering things up who knows right I</text>
  <text start="287.2" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t trust the FBI at all and of course</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="4.83">neither does AG bar that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.12" dur="5.69">having them Co investigate with the IG</text>
  <text start="295.3" dur="5.07">so it&amp;#39;s getting very interesting but</text>

  <text start="300.37" dur="3.69">there with drones of course trying to</text>
