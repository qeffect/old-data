  <text start="170.389" dur="4.8">appeal to ridicule like you&amp;#39;ve seen it</text>
  <text start="173.18" dur="3.509">before you know about this so they just</text>
  <text start="175.189" dur="3.77">use insults instead of arguments they</text>
  <text start="176.689" dur="6.33">try to make you look stupid they try to</text>
  <text start="178.959" dur="6.551">make you fear being ridiculed and then</text>

  <text start="191.75" dur="3.84">then we&amp;#39;re gonna go through a couple of</text>
  <text start="192.829" dur="4.86">things one this quote is from Martin</text>
  <text start="195.59" dur="4.5">gets on Twitter or Gettys I don&amp;#39;t how to</text>
  <text start="197.689" dur="3.901">pronounce it the use of conspiracy</text>
  <text start="200.09" dur="3.69">theory to shut down your critical</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="4.229">thinking by making you fear ridicule is</text>
  <text start="203.78" dur="4.5">a technique of mind control not</text>
  <text start="205.819" dur="5.07">journalism the pretense to expert</text>
  <text start="208.28" dur="4.169">Authority to fact-check for you suggests</text>
  <text start="210.889" dur="2.731">you cannot think for yourself that need</text>
  <text start="212.449" dur="3.391">to be fed what to believe</text>
  <text start="213.62" dur="5.429">alright now I really want to get this</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="6.119">out there because there are just so much</text>
  <text start="219.049" dur="4.62">drama going on right now it is important</text>
  <text start="221.959" dur="3.03">before we go into the midterms before we</text>
  <text start="223.669" dur="3.361">go into the arrest before we go into</text>
  <text start="224.989" dur="5.49">everything he was talked and promised</text>
  <text start="227.03" dur="6.84">okay we have to be we have to purify our</text>
  <text start="230.479" dur="4.951">movement and this is going to expose a</text>
  <text start="233.87" dur="3.349">lot of folks that some of us considered</text>
  <text start="235.43" dur="4.229">heroes one of mine Jack Paar so Burke</text>
  <text start="237.219" dur="3.91">he&amp;#39;s flip-flopped on pizza gate he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.659" dur="3.45">done a lot of bad things in fact even</text>
  <text start="241.129" dur="3.991">Liz called email Jack Pacific called</text>
  <text start="243.109" dur="4.41">pizza gate fake they called John McCain</text>
  <text start="245.12" dur="4.769">a hero and cue a LARP not to mention</text>
  <text start="247.519" dur="4.411">he&amp;#39;s flip-flopped on pizza gate and cue</text>
  <text start="249.889" dur="4.201">and he has zero credibility this is from</text>
  <text start="251.93" dur="7.369">Liz croakin like the foremost expert and</text>
  <text start="254.09" dur="5.209">and voice on pizza gate all right so</text>
  <text start="260.239" dur="5.171">it&amp;#39;s very easy to spot these folks they</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="3.69">will they will try to use insults they</text>
  <text start="265.41" dur="3.9">will try to attack they will never</text>
  <text start="267.15" dur="5.04">engage in honest dialogue they will</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="4.68">never engage in honest debate all right</text>
  <text start="272.19" dur="3.15">that&amp;#39;s the difference now we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="2.7">win a lot of people over with this</text>
  <text start="275.34" dur="3.75">because we&amp;#39;re going mainstream but at</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="4.77">the same point we&amp;#39;re going to shed some</text>
  <text start="279.09" dur="4.74">of our loose or some of our our baggage</text>
  <text start="281.46" dur="4.38">on this some of our some of our our</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="4.41">weaker link some of our our shill some</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="4.8">of our infiltrator some of the folks who</text>
  <text start="288.24" dur="3.66">are there to pretend to be Magga until</text>
  <text start="290.64" dur="4.35">the time when we need them and then</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="6.24">they&amp;#39;re going to toe the MSM line all</text>
  <text start="294.99" dur="6.9">right so a couple of examples just with</text>
  <text start="298.14" dur="5.64">my debate with Lee I did a five-hour Q</text>
  <text start="301.89" dur="4.86">anon debate which he avoided queueing on</text>
  <text start="303.78" dur="4.98">for five hours on he switched over to</text>

  <text start="331.71" dur="3.48">useless debate you can practice on the</text>
  <text start="333.66" dur="3.45">useful useless debates when it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="335.19" dur="3.66">you and that person that you know you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="393.06" dur="5.7">he&amp;#39;ll to ridicule that counters an</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="4.71">appeal to ridicule if that makes any</text>
  <text start="398.76" dur="4.5">sense for you so yeah I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="401.7" dur="3.78">engage in a pill to ridicule generally I</text>

  <text start="414.87" dur="4.11">appropriate time to make it look stupid</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="4.29">okay that&amp;#39;s where the useful debate</text>
  <text start="418.98" dur="4.77">comes in when there&amp;#39;s an audience and</text>
  <text start="421.23" dur="4.65">you can calmly politely make them look</text>
  <text start="423.75" dur="4.74">stupid point out what they&amp;#39;re doing as</text>
  <text start="425.88" dur="4.86">as deceptive and manipulative and just</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="3.72">point that out all right you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="430.74" dur="2.97">to win the argument you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="432.21" dur="2.94">prove Q at this point all you have to do</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="2.91">is prove that they are being deceptive</text>
  <text start="435.15" dur="4.8">and that they are lying to their</text>
  <text start="436.62" dur="4.32">audience okay you point that out or if</text>
  <text start="439.95" dur="2.07">they don&amp;#39;t have an audience maybe</text>
  <text start="440.94" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re not a figure maybe they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="442.02" dur="4.14">like another small person who doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="444.33" dur="3.839">have like a YouTube channel or a large</text>
  <text start="446.16" dur="4.2">reach but maybe they&amp;#39;re out there doing</text>
  <text start="448.169" dur="3.81">their part and you want to push back at</text>
  <text start="450.36" dur="3.09">that if there&amp;#39;s five or six people</text>
  <text start="451.979" dur="3.631">watching that&amp;#39;s fine too</text>
  <text start="453.45" dur="3.9">the people on the fence have no ego</text>
  <text start="455.61" dur="3.39">involved they&amp;#39;re not they&amp;#39;re anonymous</text>
  <text start="457.35" dur="5.79">no one knows that they&amp;#39;re watching okay</text>
  <text start="459" dur="5.61">but you can convince them you don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="463.14" dur="3.6">have to prove Q it&amp;#39;s the beauty of the</text>
  <text start="464.61" dur="3.929">whole thing all you have to do is and</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="3.21">let that person be shown as what they</text>
  <text start="468.539" dur="4.891">really are which is deceptive</text>
  <text start="469.95" dur="6.36">manipulative and dishonest and then then</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="5.76">you can start dropping the Q proofs calm</text>
  <text start="476.31" dur="4.62">and the evidence for Q because then you</text>
  <text start="479.19" dur="3.69">will have shown that you are the logical</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="3.15">reasonable person and you&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="482.88" dur="2.759">get you&amp;#39;re not gonna get everyone</text>
  <text start="484.08" dur="4.29">because not everyone understands reason</text>
  <text start="485.639" dur="5.881">and logic but you maximize your chance</text>
  <text start="488.37" dur="4.5">with those anonymous no ego people there</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="3.959">their egos not involved they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="492.87" dur="3.87">gonna be proven wrong in public like the</text>

  <text start="504.6" dur="5.31">ability to reason by taking their ego</text>
  <text start="506.46" dur="5.37">out you&amp;#39;re doing them a favor by tearing</text>
  <text start="509.91" dur="5.369">this this person up making them look</text>
