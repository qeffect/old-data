  <text start="187.61" dur="6.81">had a government sourcing in the very</text>
  <text start="190.88" dur="5.1">beginning at all I think they added that</text>

  <text start="195.98" dur="4.319">turns out and it of course it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="197.6" dur="5.1">gonna stick we&amp;#39;re journalists they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="200.299" dur="5.601">just declare us talking about something</text>
  <text start="202.7" dur="3.2">to be terrorist activities</text>
  <text start="209.37" dur="4.38">I did see Beto laughing Jules yeah we</text>

  <text start="228.9" dur="3.74">moment so I have to do some of the</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="2.45">focusing</text>
  <text start="241.4" dur="2.91">John thank you for saying that I</text>
  <text start="243.42" dur="3.03">appreciate it man</text>
  <text start="244.31" dur="4.06">stop that burning is starting to get</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="3.6">some interest and I got an update from</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="4.67">the attorney today who&amp;#39;s taking a</text>
  <text start="250.05" dur="12.57">much-needed short vacation himself</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="12.03">caffeine addict good to see you caffeine</text>
  <text start="262.62" dur="2.45">that&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="269.83" dur="4.38">so I think Beto is a sick sick sick</text>
  <text start="271.96" dur="5.88">person that&amp;#39;s just conjecture and</text>
  <text start="274.21" dur="5.1">speculation but I think that he actually</text>
  <text start="277.84" dur="3.78">is probably one of those full</text>
  <text start="279.31" dur="5.22">psychopathic people who just doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="5.609">care enough to even sometimes keep up</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="3.99">the act you know like he just lets it</text>
  <text start="287.229" dur="3.211">slip that he doesn&amp;#39;t care and he laughs</text>
  <text start="288.52" dur="5.91">and sometimes in the face of you know</text>
  <text start="290.44" dur="11.219">dead people or fantasizes about running</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="9.51">over children that kind of stuff but</text>
  <text start="301.659" dur="4.051">yeah so I mean you know I&amp;#39;m just I want</text>
  <text start="303.94" dur="4.56">to always get ahead of these things when</text>
  <text start="305.71" dur="4.709">they start trying to have a violence is</text>
  <text start="308.5" dur="3.12">cue and I&amp;#39;m sort of rally you know</text>
  <text start="310.419" dur="4.351">that&amp;#39;s what they do every once in a</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="4.5">while this FBI thing was one part of it</text>
  <text start="314.77" dur="2.519">that these shootings may have been</text>
  <text start="316.12" dur="4.47">another part of it obviously they</text>
  <text start="317.289" dur="6.201">attempt to link it to Q is a part of it</text>
  <text start="320.59" dur="5.6">that&amp;#39;s what they always seem to do but</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="6.25">these seem to be a little bit more</text>
  <text start="326.19" dur="6.31">closely spaced this seems to be a bit of</text>
  <text start="329.74" dur="5.19">an organized push to try to link our</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="5.06">president to Q to violence to two</text>
  <text start="334.93" dur="2.63">nonsense</text>
  <text start="338.319" dur="4.44">DT says has the Sandman versus</text>
  <text start="340.87" dur="4.47">Washington Post Burak change for legal</text>
  <text start="342.759" dur="3.991">strategy no it&amp;#39;s a different case and</text>
  <text start="345.34" dur="3.03">there&amp;#39;s that you know that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="2.88">that that case is over either you know</text>
  <text start="348.37" dur="3.81">they&amp;#39;re not giving up that fight that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.63" dur="4.259">gonna get appealed I&amp;#39;m sure but that</text>
  <text start="352.18" dur="3.51">just is a different kind of case after</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="4.051">all I mean he&amp;#39;s a private citizen and</text>
  <text start="355.69" dur="5.279">he&amp;#39;s not a minor and it was it more of a</text>
  <text start="357.94" dur="4.62">defamation and slander kind of thing you</text>
  <text start="360.969" dur="3.781">know the mainstream media has slandered</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="4.05">and defamed me and cost me like tons of</text>
  <text start="364.75" dur="3.84">money with the you know slandering of</text>
  <text start="366.61" dur="3.899">the book and stuff there&amp;#39;s no way I</text>
  <text start="368.59" dur="3.449">would probably win an illegal action</text>
  <text start="370.509" dur="4.41">against them for slander because I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="372.039" dur="6">adult and a public figure so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="374.919" dur="4.981">different case generally speaking like</text>
  <text start="378.039" dur="3.211">you don&amp;#39;t really get to win a slander</text>
  <text start="379.9" dur="2.759">case it&amp;#39;s very difficult you have to</text>
  <text start="381.25" dur="5.61">prove like intention all this other</text>
  <text start="382.659" dur="5.671">stuff but then again I&amp;#39;m not the expert</text>
  <text start="386.86" dur="3.059">on these things you know I&amp;#39;m not the</text>
  <text start="388.33" dur="4.41">legal expert by any means that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="389.919" dur="8.37">hired a super lawyer to help us out at</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="8.75">stopped at Burning calm Dominic yes I</text>
  <text start="398.289" dur="7.341">did sad admit</text>
  <text start="401.49" dur="5.549">I haven&amp;#39;t already thing new out of it</text>
  <text start="405.63" dur="4.14">lately though what is there anything new</text>
  <text start="407.039" dur="4.35">matter John McGann I mean of course it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.77" dur="3.39">linked you know these things are often</text>
  <text start="411.389" dur="3">linked and there were links between some</text>
  <text start="413.16" dur="3.15">of the child traffickers there and I</text>
  <text start="414.389" dur="5.611">think and some of the the other networks</text>
  <text start="416.31" dur="5.31">out there but there always seems to be a</text>
  <text start="420" dur="6.569">mini Clinton Foundation it seems to have</text>
  <text start="421.62" dur="6.99">a finger and most of them and yeah there</text>
  <text start="426.569" dur="3.301">are photos circulating I don&amp;#39;t have one</text>
  <text start="428.61" dur="3.899">unfortunately with our photos</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="6.419">circulating of the one of the killer&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="437.43" dur="4.26">psychic psychiatrist or a therapist or</text>
  <text start="439.59" dur="3.81">something and he had a lot of weird</text>
  <text start="441.69" dur="4.02">symbolism in his background and he</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="7.41">seemed to be the right profile at least</text>
  <text start="445.71" dur="10.679">I mean oftentimes these these therapists</text>
  <text start="450.81" dur="7.229">are their handlers and and and the look</text>
  <text start="456.389" dur="5.34">that they have I mean that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="524.85" dur="5.729">was writing about a Call of Duty fantasy</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="4.979">right that&amp;#39;s disgusting I mean and I</text>
  <text start="530.579" dur="3.031">love video games don&amp;#39;t get me wrong and</text>
  <text start="532.079" dur="3.211">I don&amp;#39;t think that video games leads to</text>
  <text start="533.61" dur="3.78">violence if anything</text>
  <text start="535.29" dur="5.7">you know having a competitive edge or</text>
  <text start="537.39" dur="7.05">having a competitive outlet is a good</text>
  <text start="540.99" dur="5.13">thing for young men especially but you</text>
  <text start="544.44" dur="3.12">know maybe it does desensitize a little</text>
  <text start="546.12" dur="4.35">bit to gun violence or something but</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="7.05">they basically this is a low-hanging</text>
