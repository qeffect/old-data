  <text start="1.129" dur="5.201">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="3.629" dur="4.8">Nemo&amp;#39;s of Destiny Mouse calm this is</text>
  <text start="6.33" dur="4.38">gonna be a very brief talk about the</text>
  <text start="8.429" dur="5.851">word unity a word we see thrown around</text>
  <text start="10.71" dur="7.2">quite often lately a word that has a lot</text>
  <text start="14.28" dur="5.82">of weight behind it but also a word that</text>
  <text start="17.91" dur="4.8">is a little bit confusing in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="8.31">context let me explain what I mean by</text>
  <text start="22.71" dur="7.469">that there are people within movements</text>
  <text start="28.41" dur="3.42">and and I don&amp;#39;t have to necessarily</text>
  <text start="30.179" dur="3.361">speak about the magum movement or the</text>
  <text start="31.83" dur="3.93">cue movement or the conservative</text>
  <text start="33.54" dur="3.81">movement or whatever but just it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="35.76" dur="3.959">strategy right it&amp;#39;s like a chess move</text>
  <text start="37.35" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a strategy to to divide and</text>
  <text start="39.719" dur="6.32">conquer let&amp;#39;s use for example one</text>
  <text start="43.2" dur="5.49">example I like to use is the Tea Party</text>
  <text start="46.039" dur="5.2">started out with a lot of energy a lot</text>
  <text start="48.69" dur="4.68">of grassroots organization but</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="5.55">eventually it was co-opted at the higher</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="6.779">levels and what I mean is that people</text>
  <text start="56.789" dur="5.07">were put into position who served a</text>
  <text start="60.149" dur="3.721">certain agenda certain narrative but</text>
  <text start="61.859" dur="4.171">openly they they said the right things</text>
  <text start="63.87" dur="3.48">they they earn the trust of the movement</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="2.55">and then they became leaders within the</text>
  <text start="67.35" dur="3.9">movement and then they sort of derailed</text>
  <text start="68.58" dur="4.289">the movement now that&amp;#39;s not one</text>
  <text start="71.25" dur="4.08">particular agenda that&amp;#39;s many different</text>
  <text start="72.869" dur="3.601">things okay and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the Delian</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="3.57">dialectic you&amp;#39;ve heard this term</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="4.2">probably you know you control both sides</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="7.109">of the debate and then you can control</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="9.269">the outcome so when when we speak about</text>
  <text start="86.009" dur="5.461">unity unity is like a it&amp;#39;s like a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="89.939" dur="3.121">word like puppies it&amp;#39;s like a word</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="4.439">that&amp;#39;s just generally considered to be a</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="4.53">good thing you know on the left they</text>
  <text start="95.909" dur="4.651">would say multiculturalism is a good</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="5.569">thing across all spectrums but in many</text>
  <text start="100.56" dur="6.39">cases incompatible cultures for example</text>
  <text start="103.159" dur="5.53">in close proximity or just conflict so</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="4.709">it&amp;#39;s not a good thing multiculturalism</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="6.451">is not a strength for example okay not</text>
  <text start="111.659" dur="5.731">necessarily by default at least you know</text>
  <text start="115.14" dur="4.769">Islam culture and Western civilization</text>
  <text start="117.39" dur="5.85">they&amp;#39;re not compatible cultures they</text>
  <text start="119.909" dur="5.1">create conflict so when we talk about</text>
  <text start="123.24" dur="4.05">unity it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of an emotional</text>
  <text start="125.009" dur="4.59">word and it&amp;#39;s a word that we sort of</text>
  <text start="127.29" dur="4.86">want to we want to be within union with</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="4.081">the people around us we want to to be on</text>
  <text start="132.15" dur="5.039">good terms with the people around us</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="5.009">and and I&amp;#39;m not against that at all but</text>
  <text start="137.189" dur="2.821">I&amp;#39;m getting a lot of people in the</text>
  <text start="138.689" dur="2.61">comments so I may as well make a video</text>
  <text start="140.01" dur="3.24">and not try to address the thousand</text>
  <text start="141.299" dur="4.94">comments a day but it may be just a</text>
  <text start="143.25" dur="6.569">video to talk about unity for a moment</text>
  <text start="146.239" dur="6.67">in the manga movement it is my position</text>
  <text start="149.819" dur="7.101">that there are people who are controlled</text>
  <text start="152.909" dur="8.791">opposition I won&amp;#39;t name names but</text>
  <text start="156.92" dur="6.459">disinformation people who befriended the</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="4.77">movement who came in said the right</text>
  <text start="163.379" dur="5.431">things became you know leaders or or had</text>
  <text start="166.47" dur="6.9">positions of influence and then use that</text>
  <text start="168.81" dur="8.61">influence to sort of divide now this is</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="6.75">an insidious form of disunity and then</text>
  <text start="177.42" dur="5.039">when when someone exposes that for</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="4.86">example I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve taken the cue mission</text>
  <text start="182.459" dur="4.56">to you know as I understand it I I</text>
  <text start="184.98" dur="3.899">interpreted the cue post to say that we</text>
  <text start="187.019" dur="3.09">need to expose the fake news originally</text>
  <text start="188.879" dur="3.48">and I did that for a while you know I</text>
  <text start="190.109" dur="3.72">was talking about fake news but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.359" dur="1.951">well done they&amp;#39;re cooked no one trusts</text>
  <text start="193.829" dur="2.97">them anymore</text>
  <text start="194.31" dur="5.37">and more recently I&amp;#39;ve taken the cue</text>
  <text start="196.799" dur="5.101">post to mean we have to expose the fake</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="4.619">Magus which are fake news embedded</text>
  <text start="201.9" dur="4.47">within our own ranks traitors in our</text>
  <text start="204.299" dur="3.991">midst you might say and this is not</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="4.229">something where I&amp;#39;m calling for disunity</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="5.759">with with people out there Patriots out</text>
  <text start="210.599" dur="6.03">there this is a few specific people who</text>
  <text start="214.049" dur="3.601">are creating a lot of chaos you know and</text>
  <text start="216.629" dur="2.94">when I talked about the lighthouse</text>
  <text start="217.65" dur="5.759">metaphor we have to be the lighthouse</text>
  <text start="219.569" dur="5.551">these are the rocks now there&amp;#39;s the big</text>
  <text start="223.409" dur="4.8">rocks that you can kind of spot they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="4.679">easy to see those are the fake news but</text>
  <text start="228.209" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s also the rocks that you can</text>
  <text start="229.799" dur="5.43">barely see that you can crash your ship</text>
  <text start="231.599" dur="6.151">upon okay those are the fake Magus</text>
  <text start="235.229" dur="4.081">they&amp;#39;re within our ranks we can&amp;#39;t spot</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="5.639">them necessarily because they&amp;#39;re cloaked</text>
  <text start="239.31" dur="6.72">in a maggot but what if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="243.389" dur="4.56">really Magra what if they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="246.03" dur="4.26">pro-trump what if they&amp;#39;re anti-trump</text>
  <text start="247.949" dur="5.82">pretending to be pro-trump to insert</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="5.43">division to create disunity am i</text>
  <text start="253.769" dur="4.65">creating disunity by exposing them or am</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="5.46">i helping to purify the movement to</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="5.37">create greater unity after after it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.18" dur="3.56">all said and done because if they&amp;#39;re out</text>
  <text start="263.789" dur="3.031">there spreading disinformation</text>
  <text start="264.74" dur="4.15">narratives and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="5.84">mixing in lies with truth and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="268.89" dur="3.77">there pissing in the pool</text>
  <text start="273.41" dur="5.2">shouldn&amp;#39;t we expose now I think Hugh has</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="3.69">tasked us to expose it but beyond what</text>
  <text start="278.61" dur="3.45">he was asked us to do wouldn&amp;#39;t it be</text>
  <text start="280.56" dur="4.59">better for the movement if we knew who</text>
  <text start="282.06" dur="7.98">we could trust if we expose liars on</text>
  <text start="285.15" dur="8.43">both sides otherwise you know it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="5.31">gonna make us look bad anyway so I am a</text>
  <text start="293.58" dur="4.11">position that I want unity for the mag</text>
  <text start="295.35" dur="4.5">of movement but I don&amp;#39;t have unity with</text>
  <text start="297.69" dur="2.7">liars and I don&amp;#39;t think that you should</text>
  <text start="299.85" dur="4.5">either</text>
  <text start="300.39" dur="6.45">I want unity with people who are truly</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="3.78">for Trump and I don&amp;#39;t care if you&amp;#39;re for</text>
  <text start="306.84" dur="3.21">Q or not that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="308.13" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;m not here to convince you to be about</text>
  <text start="310.05" dur="4.86">Q at that part is that part of my show</text>
  <text start="312.75" dur="5.46">is done I no longer feel the need to</text>
  <text start="314.91" dur="4.8">convince anyone about you you either see</text>
  <text start="318.21" dur="3.75">it or you don&amp;#39;t at this point and if you</text>
  <text start="319.71" dur="4.38">care to look I think you&amp;#39;ll see it but</text>
  <text start="321.96" dur="4.14">does it matter if you believe in Q write</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="3.66">it the information that he brings out is</text>
  <text start="326.1" dur="3.09">still doing good in the world whether</text>
  <text start="327.75" dur="4.47">you think he&amp;#39;s a fake or a LARP or</text>
  <text start="329.19" dur="6.15">whatever but the people out there who</text>
  <text start="332.22" dur="6.72">are spreading disinformation I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="335.34" dur="6.36">keep exposing them because they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="338.94" dur="4.47">real harm they&amp;#39;re confusing a lot of</text>
  <text start="341.7" dur="4.11">people who mean well and don&amp;#39;t know any</text>
  <text start="343.41" dur="5.19">better and maybe trust them and maybe</text>
  <text start="345.81" dur="5.73">shouldn&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ve trusted them before</text>
  <text start="348.6" dur="7.65">myself some of these fake magaz were</text>
  <text start="351.54" dur="8.73">people that I looked up to so you know</text>
  <text start="356.25" dur="7.65">in the nature of unity good can&amp;#39;t mix</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="6.6">with evil truth cannot have unity with</text>
  <text start="363.9" dur="5.07">deception and therefore I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="366.87" dur="4.83">that we should seek unity for the sake</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="5.37">of unity I think we should seek truth</text>
  <text start="371.7" dur="5.88">and find unity with those who seek truth</text>
  <text start="374.34" dur="6.98">and I think in the end will be stronger</text>
  <text start="377.58" dur="6.3">for it that&amp;#39;s my position on unity and</text>
  <text start="381.32" dur="3.97">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of that flying</text>
  <text start="383.88" dur="3.75">around of the keywords it&amp;#39;s sort of the</text>
  <text start="385.29" dur="4.49">big accusation it&amp;#39;s the well you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="387.63" dur="7.11">creating disunity by exposing this guy</text>
  <text start="389.78" dur="8.09">well not an argument okay if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.74" dur="5.41">lying they&amp;#39;re gonna harm our movement</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="3.63">when I saw faulty cue proofs there were</text>
  <text start="400.15" dur="3.239">some bad ones mixed in with the good</text>
  <text start="401.5" dur="3.3">ones they&amp;#39;re just a few but I I said we</text>
  <text start="403.389" dur="4.59">should take those out those are not good</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;ll make us look bad when I see</text>
  <text start="407.979" dur="4.171">people lying I say hey we need to expose</text>
  <text start="410.38" dur="4.289">those people because they make us look</text>
  <text start="412.15" dur="4.92">bad one example would be Richard Spencer</text>
  <text start="414.669" dur="4.651">and his fake Nazis this guy was a former</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="4.349">Obama supporter but the day that Trump</text>
  <text start="419.32" dur="6.09">was elected he turned into a white</text>
  <text start="421.419" dur="4.671">nationalist white supremacist Nazi Yeah</text>
  <text start="425.41" dur="4.17">right</text>
  <text start="426.09" dur="7.12">that&amp;#39;s what I mean by disinformation</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="6.03">agents creating problems do you want</text>
  <text start="433.21" dur="5.01">unity just because he&amp;#39;s on the right and</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="6.119">whereas a mega hot do you seek unity</text>
  <text start="438.22" dur="5.43">with these fake Nazis probably not and</text>
  <text start="441.729" dur="3.211">I&amp;#39;m not saying that you do but I am</text>
  <text start="443.65" dur="4.95">gonna use that as an example because</text>
  <text start="444.94" dur="6.979">it&amp;#39;s pretty clear-cut water and oil</text>
  <text start="448.6" dur="6.21">don&amp;#39;t mix truth and lies don&amp;#39;t mix</text>
  <text start="451.919" dur="6.131">honest Patriots should not seek unity</text>
  <text start="454.81" dur="4.8">with Liars in the movement and just</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="3.149">because they we got the fake news</text>
  <text start="459.61" dur="4.17">everybody knows about that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="461.199" dur="5.22">that the mission is over there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="463.78" dur="5.18">fake news in our own side they had it on</text>
  <text start="466.419" dur="7.861">both sides that&amp;#39;s what they do</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="7.09">this is chess not checkers so this is my</text>
  <text start="474.28" dur="4.67">position this is my argument let me know</text>
