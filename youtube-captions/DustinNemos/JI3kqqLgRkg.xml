  <text start="238.319" dur="7.831">right back over and he says hunters have</text>
  <text start="241.769" dur="6.631">become the hunted Sinnott was the target</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="3.839">and you can see why so that they could</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="4.559">begin to investigate all of these</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="5.461">financial crimes oh man and of course</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="4.171">others just like Al Capone I guess</text>
  <text start="255.45" dur="3.659">they&amp;#39;re gonna bring these guys down with</text>
  <text start="257.13" dur="8.159">with financial crimes because the true</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="8.49">crimes would create a surge a mob an</text>
  <text start="265.289" dur="4.111">angry mob demanding their heads if the</text>
  <text start="267.599" dur="3.54">true stuff really came out in the full</text>
  <text start="269.4" dur="4.009">depth and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve seen in the</text>
  <text start="271.139" dur="5.611">past where Q is mentioned you know 60%</text>
  <text start="273.409" dur="6.091">public 40% private and then later he</text>
  <text start="276.75" dur="5.4">changed it and and at least at least</text>
  <text start="279.5" dur="5.95">somewhat agreed in principle that 80%</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="6">public 20% private and of course you</text>
  <text start="285.45" dur="4.8">know people like me you know III</text>
  <text start="288.15" dur="3.99">friendly in a friendly way I disagree</text>
  <text start="290.25" dur="3.78">with cute right I I&amp;#39;m a truth will out</text>
  <text start="292.14" dur="4.23">though the heavens may fall kind of guy</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="3.509">I want the full truth out there and</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="3.72">whoever gets their feelings hurt</text>
  <text start="297.539" dur="3.481">whatever happens that&amp;#39;s the price we pay</text>
  <text start="300.09" dur="4.05">to be free</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="4.44">however Hugh thinks that at least I</text>
  <text start="304.14" dur="4.38">assume he thinks we would end up in a</text>
  <text start="305.46" dur="4.92">war if this information came out and in</text>
  <text start="308.52" dur="3.149">that case look I understand it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310.38" dur="3.27">trying to save as many people as</text>
  <text start="311.669" dur="3.901">possible it&amp;#39;s a burden that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="313.65" dur="4.74">fortunately don&amp;#39;t have to make that</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="4.469">decision that this is obviously a</text>
  <text start="318.39" dur="4.14">decision that trumping you have have</text>
  <text start="320.039" dur="4.291">kind of come together with that it can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="322.53" dur="5.61">all come out a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="324.33" dur="7.35">disclosure and that is unfortunate so</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="6.75">we&amp;#39;re heading up to 36 26 I flip over</text>
  <text start="331.68" dur="6.71">here and it says general Flint okay so</text>
  <text start="334.89" dur="9.69">this is a Twitter from general Flint and</text>
  <text start="338.39" dur="8.98">I will switch back over this is in</text>
  <text start="344.58" dur="5.79">regard to spirit cooking and this is</text>
  <text start="347.37" dur="4.95">from back in 2016 now I wonder why they</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="4.83">had to target him so much I wonder why</text>
  <text start="352.32" dur="4.649">he was such a threat and I wonder why</text>
  <text start="355.2" dur="4.14">they came down on him as hard as they</text>
  <text start="356.969" dur="5.25">did well this might explain it he was</text>
  <text start="359.34" dur="5.31">calling attention to the Weiner laptop</text>
  <text start="362.219" dur="5.25">case and Hillary Clinton and talking</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="4.98">about draining the swamp in 2016 talking</text>
  <text start="367.469" dur="4.111">about spirit cooking in some of the the</text>
  <text start="369.63" dur="3.539">dark pedophilic stuff that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="371.58" dur="3.6">behind the scenes at the hall at the</text>
  <text start="373.169" dur="4.711">heights and halls of power including</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="5.19">with the Heights and halls of power in</text>
  <text start="377.88" dur="4.77">Hollywood and entertainment and Disney</text>
  <text start="380.37" dur="4.08">and of course all of these things</text>
  <text start="382.65" dur="6.3">connected to Epstein and then of course</text>
  <text start="384.45" dur="8.55">the swamp itself that disgusting old</text>
  <text start="388.95" dur="11.87">cesspit of corruption now continuing</text>
  <text start="393" dur="9.899">back to the Q post here switch back over</text>
  <text start="400.82" dur="3.909">hopefully it&amp;#39;s worth the trouble because</text>
  <text start="402.899" dur="4.051">you guys can read it better right let me</text>
  <text start="404.729" dur="4.321">know what you think we can always switch</text>
  <text start="406.95" dur="4.44">back if it doesn&amp;#39;t help so general Flynn</text>
  <text start="409.05" dur="5.55">was targeted because he knew too much</text>
  <text start="411.39" dur="9.33">and Hugh says targeted and silenced for</text>
  <text start="414.6" dur="8.04">a reason pain coming 36:27 what happens</text>
  <text start="420.72" dur="3.6">if General Flint starts once he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="422.64" dur="3.48">vindicated comes out and starts really</text>
  <text start="424.32" dur="4.17">dropping some truth bombs and disclosure</text>
  <text start="426.12" dur="5.07">on that topic people would believe him</text>
  <text start="428.49" dur="5.43">people would start to really wake up to</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="5.49">this in a way that no one has before I</text>
  <text start="433.92" dur="6.66">mean he&amp;#39;s been martyred just like Trump</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="6.33">has in the last couple years hard to go</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="6.69">against a martyr just ask the people</text>
  <text start="443.01" dur="8.21">going against Trump 36:27 so we have</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="3.95">this one that says let me switch over</text>
  <text start="451.88" dur="8.5">this is future trip code re-verify now</text>
  <text start="458.88" dur="3.15">you guys do remember I&amp;#39;ve been talked</text>
  <text start="460.38" dur="4.38">about this for a while because we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="462.03" dur="4.8">a new board and because they&amp;#39;re also</text>
  <text start="464.76" dur="4.11">making some new updates and changes in</text>
  <text start="466.83" dur="3.63">the back end of this board and this is</text>
  <text start="468.87" dur="5.1">of course eight Coon instead of eight</text>
  <text start="470.46" dur="6.96">chan this cue in theory could be a fake</text>
  <text start="473.97" dur="5.04">now shouldn&amp;#39;t because the trip codes the</text>
  <text start="477.42" dur="3.99">same and it was just a copy of the old</text>
  <text start="479.01" dur="4.68">database as I understand it but just in</text>
  <text start="481.41" dur="5.52">in principle it&amp;#39;s good to know for sure</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="6.15">so he&amp;#39;s expecting and he&amp;#39;s promising</text>
  <text start="486.93" dur="5.73">here another verification soon involving</text>
  <text start="489.84" dur="4.71">the presidential notebook pen watch and</text>
  <text start="492.66" dur="4.38">desk so we&amp;#39;ve seen pictures in the past</text>
  <text start="494.55" dur="4.14">where someone who wasn&amp;#39;t Hugh who didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="497.04" dur="3.78">have access to the White House could not</text>
  <text start="498.69" dur="3.99">have gotten all of these original images</text>
  <text start="500.82" dur="3.18">and frankly you can search images</text>
  <text start="502.68" dur="3.21">through different functions on the</text>
  <text start="504" dur="4.44">internet where you can determine that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="4.35">never been online before that&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="508.44" dur="3.81">original image from off the internet you</text>
  <text start="510.24" dur="4.35">know so about the only way to do that</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="5.04">anymore is to take your own new images</text>
  <text start="514.59" dur="4.59">or to find something from like the 1500s</text>
  <text start="517.29" dur="4.05">that hasn&amp;#39;t yet been translated and</text>
  <text start="519.18" dur="5.13">copied online but that&amp;#39;s pretty hard to</text>
  <text start="521.34" dur="5.25">do as well although as I understand it</text>
  <text start="524.31" dur="4.56">most of the older texts have never been</text>
  <text start="526.59" dur="5.88">translated from Sanskrit or anything and</text>
  <text start="528.87" dur="5.22">and turned into digital works so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.47" dur="5.1">who knows what kind of knowledge has</text>
  <text start="534.09" dur="5.79">been lost there so he also promises that</text>
  <text start="537.57" dur="3.6">a non interaction is coming soon so</text>
  <text start="539.88" dur="3.51">maybe he&amp;#39;ll be back on the queue</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="3.99">research board answering questions or or</text>
  <text start="543.39" dur="4.08">maybe we&amp;#39;ll get another Q&amp;amp;A</text>
  <text start="545.16" dur="3.75">right because some of those last Q&amp;amp;A</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="3.83">sessions were very interesting we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="6.299">addressed some big points for example</text>
  <text start="551.3" dur="5.979">JFK jr. he&amp;#39;s not alive I&amp;#39;m sorry the</text>
  <text start="555.209" dur="4.831">gold standard gold will destroy the Fed</text>
  <text start="557.279" dur="5.25">so maybe we can actually expect the gold</text>
  <text start="560.04" dur="5.21">standard to return to America and that</text>
  <text start="562.529" dur="4.92">would create with it a golden era and</text>
  <text start="565.25" dur="3.579">even better than the gold Stan and</text>
  <text start="567.449" dur="3.091">frankly folks</text>
  <text start="568.829" dur="4.74">he said gold will destroy the Fed let me</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="5.25">clarify here a gold standard is crap and</text>
  <text start="573.569" dur="3.991">Mike Maloney made this point recently in</text>
  <text start="575.79" dur="4.38">a video he put out and I really respect</text>
  <text start="577.56" dur="3.959">his viewpoints on this but the gold</text>
  <text start="580.17" dur="3.45">standard is crap</text>
  <text start="581.519" dur="4.231">it&amp;#39;s just another way for them to</text>
  <text start="583.62" dur="4.8">eventually take gold and turn it into</text>
  <text start="585.75" dur="4.199">fiat if you think about it gold and</text>
  <text start="588.42" dur="3.599">silver are the real money</text>
  <text start="589.949" dur="3.69">maybe cryptos look I&amp;#39;m not against those</text>
  <text start="592.019" dur="4.591">I think they&amp;#39;re very convenient and very</text>
  <text start="593.639" dur="5.401">secure digital currency in some cases</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="4.5">the technology has a long way to go but</text>
  <text start="599.04" dur="5.849">with gold and silver it&amp;#39;s good money</text>
  <text start="601.11" dur="5.579">coin metal coins like the Constitution&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="604.889" dur="4.291">constitutional money in fact it was what</text>
  <text start="606.689" dur="5.791">we&amp;#39;re supposed to be creating for money</text>
  <text start="609.18" dur="5.969">in the Constitution whereas a backed a</text>
  <text start="612.48" dur="5.52">gold backed or a gold standard currency</text>
  <text start="615.149" dur="4.651">is still paper and eventually they</text>
  <text start="618" dur="3.449">always get diluted more and more just</text>
  <text start="619.8" dur="4.589">like the fiat currencies gold standard</text>
  <text start="621.449" dur="4.83">currency is just a slippery slope into</text>
  <text start="624.389" dur="3.39">fiat currency where the gold standard</text>
  <text start="626.279" dur="3.75">gets a little bit less and less and less</text>
  <text start="627.779" dur="4.05">this happened to Roman it destroyed Rome</text>
  <text start="630.029" dur="4.591">this is happening to us and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="631.829" dur="5.49">destroying us and it&amp;#39;s happened to every</text>
  <text start="634.62" dur="6.18">country that&amp;#39;s ever tried to go from</text>
  <text start="637.319" dur="4.681">anything that has a real scarcity factor</text>
  <text start="640.8" dur="4.139">and it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be gold and</text>
  <text start="642" dur="4.68">silver in fact the kind of a quick</text>
  <text start="644.939" dur="3.931">ending of this copy because we&amp;#39;re all a</text>
  <text start="646.68" dur="3.57">little bit tally sticks were the</text>
  <text start="648.87" dur="1.92">longest-running currency in the history</text>
