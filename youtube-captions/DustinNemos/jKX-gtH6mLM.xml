  <text start="44.309" dur="4.711">don&amp;#39;t want people to know who you are</text>
  <text start="45.629" dur="5.791">for your own protection but kind of let</text>

  <text start="54.21" dur="2.64">lot of existing powers we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="55.53" dur="3.93">challenge we&amp;#39;re gonna take out people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="4.56">profit away we&amp;#39;re gonna sort of go after</text>
  <text start="59.46" dur="3.779">some of the bad guys and the wallet you</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="4.139">know where it really hurts</text>
  <text start="63.239" dur="4.861">and we&amp;#39;re gonna do this by leveraging</text>
  <text start="65.549" dur="4.5">your existing skill set your existing</text>
  <text start="68.1" dur="4.14">business your existing infrastructure</text>
  <text start="70.049" dur="5.371">and licenses and regulations and your</text>

  <text start="75.42" dur="5.46">just help Patriots right so I want to</text>
  <text start="79.2" dur="3.239">kind of I&amp;#39;ve been sort of hinting at it</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="4.11">for a while I&amp;#39;m very excited I want to</text>
  <text start="82.439" dur="4.711">unveil the plan to people but basically</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="4.71">things that you&amp;#39;re already buying you</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t have to buy from them if you buy</text>
  <text start="89.7" dur="3.87">from the good guys like the white hat</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="4.82">companies like Maggie sheron&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="93.57" dur="4.799">you&amp;#39;re able to actually fund good causes</text>
  <text start="96.14" dur="4.33">effectively by draining it from the bad</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="3.811">guys you can help the good guys even</text>
  <text start="100.47" dur="4.07">with the same products like in this case</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="4.619">what I would say hopefully one day</text>
  <text start="104.54" dur="4.119">unnecessary products you know health</text>
  <text start="106.799" dur="3.271">insurance probably never gonna be</text>
  <text start="108.659" dur="3.451">unnecessary that&amp;#39;s a good quality thing</text>
  <text start="110.07" dur="3.689">to have we are also going to sell</text>
  <text start="112.11" dur="3.6">prescription drugs and maybe anything</text>
  <text start="113.759" dur="4.11">else that that big pharma sells down the</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="4.74">road if we can to just take it away from</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="6.75">them and and I am going to generate a</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="5.76">lot of funds from sort of my equity of</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="4.041">that and I&amp;#39;m gonna put all of us</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="4.32">proceeds back after costs into</text>
  <text start="128.66" dur="3.85">alternative health things things like</text>
  <text start="130.53" dur="3.36">that now and Kathryn of course is</text>
  <text start="132.51" dur="3.54">generously</text>
  <text start="133.89" dur="3.929">to help me and she&amp;#39;s a for-profit</text>
  <text start="136.05" dur="4.08">company she keeps her parts there just</text>
  <text start="137.819" dur="5.971">to be really transparent with people</text>
  <text start="140.13" dur="6.27">what about what my plan is Katherine I</text>
  <text start="143.79" dur="4.98">want to kind of let people learn about</text>
  <text start="146.4" dur="3.84">you learn about your you know your</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="3.93">credibility in this field your</text>
  <text start="150.24" dur="4.56">experience in this field and kind of</text>
  <text start="152.7" dur="6.8">your story why you want to be part of</text>
  <text start="154.8" dur="7.89">this you know absolutely well I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="159.5" dur="8.08">part of the patriot movement if you will</text>
  <text start="162.69" dur="10.019">just to kind of couch all this for since</text>
  <text start="167.58" dur="12.65">the early 90s and lots of research lots</text>
  <text start="172.709" dur="9.931">of giving talks etc etc but that all had</text>
  <text start="180.23" dur="5.65">consequences to it back then we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.64" dur="9.92">have Trump in office so we didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="6.68">the the type of the judiciary and and</text>
  <text start="194.959" dur="7.901">judges in place that were going to rule</text>
  <text start="199.29" dur="7.59">if from a conservative standpoint that</text>
  <text start="202.86" dur="6.24">being said I eventually kind of walked</text>
  <text start="206.88" dur="5.76">away from that because I felt like I was</text>
  <text start="209.1" dur="5.28">chasing windmills now it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a whole</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="4.62">entirely different story</text>
  <text start="214.38" dur="4.74">but in the interim well over a decade</text>
  <text start="217.26" dur="7.86">ago I got into the insurance business</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="9.929">and I took my desire to help people and</text>
  <text start="225.12" dur="7.459">help them navigate the alien language</text>
  <text start="229.049" dur="6.541">that is insurance and help them to make</text>
  <text start="232.579" dur="6.461">informed choices because a lot of people</text>
  <text start="235.59" dur="6.899">just go online and and kind of it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.04" dur="6.63">a crapshoot if you don&amp;#39;t have a trusted</text>
  <text start="242.489" dur="5.071">advisor to help you navigate all of that</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="4.53">languaging and make sure that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="6.69">getting into a plan that&amp;#39;s a good fit</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="6.9">for you that was my my impetus for</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="6.2">wanting to get into this and here like I</text>
  <text start="257.1" dur="8.01">said over a decade later Medicaid</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="7.24">Medicare health insurance dental vision</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="7.68">travel life insurance</text>
  <text start="267.69" dur="8.12">all of the above in one company and and</text>
  <text start="272.79" dur="5.79">when I met you Dustin and we we kind of</text>
  <text start="275.81" dur="5.23">came together on the alternative health</text>
  <text start="278.58" dur="5.1">side which I had a passion for for over</text>
  <text start="281.04" dur="4.65">thirty years and done a lot of</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="6.06">experimenting on myself over the years</text>
  <text start="285.69" dur="8.6">and you know it&amp;#39;s all good me too</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="8.03">but yeah any way that I can help to</text>
  <text start="294.29" dur="8.02">transfer some of those funds into</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="6.899">helping people get the word out you know</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="5.43">people that that are talking truth</text>
  <text start="304.669" dur="6.28">people that are wanting to educate</text>
  <text start="307.74" dur="5.549">others as to you know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="310.949" dur="4.741">and not just in the world of politics</text>
  <text start="313.289" dur="3.901">but also in the world of health most</text>
  <text start="315.69" dur="3.27">especially in the world of health</text>
  <text start="317.19" dur="4.229">because if you don&amp;#39;t have your health</text>
  <text start="318.96" dur="4.5">you don&amp;#39;t have anything really you you</text>
  <text start="321.419" dur="4.5">want to go through and make a make a</text>
  <text start="323.46" dur="3.87">difference in the world that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="325.919" dur="3.961">where I&amp;#39;m all about and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="6.059">part of this and thank you for for</text>
  <text start="329.88" dur="4.68">inviting me in sure and I mean I&amp;#39;m glad</text>
  <text start="333.389" dur="3.571">that we were able to come together on</text>
  <text start="334.56" dur="4.919">this in fact I want to bring as many</text>
  <text start="336.96" dur="4.079">good guy companies together like Patriot</text>
  <text start="339.479" dur="4.171">owned businesses as I can at least</text>
  <text start="341.039" dur="4.531">things that I can influence where</text>
  <text start="343.65" dur="4.41">there&amp;#39;s like an online presence I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="4.319">help you sell auto repair on your local</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="3.63">level or anything like that but but we</text>
  <text start="349.889" dur="3.691">have real reach on the Internet we</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="4.02">actually have in some cases all mediums</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="3.869">bigger reach than than many of the MSM</text>
  <text start="355.71" dur="3.42">companies I mean we can sell things</text>
  <text start="357.449" dur="4.111">Patriots we can sell things to those</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="3.87">companies so in our audience are loyal</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="3.359">and they really want to fight back</text>
  <text start="363" dur="4.08">against evil and and they love to shop</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="3.87">and buy things so you know we can do so</text>
  <text start="367.08" dur="4.019">many when when things it&amp;#39;s not just this</text>
  <text start="368.789" dur="4.591">model but this is sort of you know I</text>
  <text start="371.099" dur="5.221">sort of called this book my where we go</text>
  <text start="373.38" dur="4.89">when we go all like phase zero proof of</text>
  <text start="376.32" dur="4.469">concept because it&amp;#39;s really just twelve</text>
  <text start="378.27" dur="4.92">people coming together to show what we</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="4.021">can do we throw our weight around and it</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="3.63">was a really cool overnight bestseller</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="4.44">things like that but it was just proof</text>
  <text start="386.82" dur="4.98">of the of the concept of coming together</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="4.59">as a team where we go one we go all kind</text>
  <text start="391.8" dur="3.88">of a JFK reference for unity and</text>
  <text start="393.84" dur="4.27">patriotism and national</text>
  <text start="395.68" dur="4.5">and very very much what what our</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="3.869">president now echoes which I can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="5.489">say his name anyone youtuber will get D</text>
  <text start="401.979" dur="5.28">boosted so what what a shame that is but</text>
  <text start="405.669" dur="3.39">but we you know my favorite thing about</text>
  <text start="407.259" dur="4.08">this you know kind of like you said is</text>
  <text start="409.059" dur="4.771">redirecting already existing revenue</text>
  <text start="411.339" dur="3.991">like and and what that means is you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="413.83" dur="3.359">already buying health insurance you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="415.33" dur="3.63">already buying prescription drugs in</text>
  <text start="417.189" dur="3.9">many cases hopefully not but if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.96" dur="3.479">on them like maybe you don&amp;#39;t want to get</text>
  <text start="421.089" dur="3">off him you can&amp;#39;t get off maybe you</text>
  <text start="422.439" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t believe in alternative health</text>
  <text start="424.089" dur="3.901">maybe you trust your doctor maybe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.159" dur="4.23">too late whatever if you&amp;#39;re still having</text>
  <text start="427.99" dur="4.109">to use them maybe you could just spend</text>
  <text start="430.389" dur="3">that same money maybe get a discount I</text>
  <text start="432.099" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m gonna try to give as big</text>
  <text start="433.389" dur="4.291">a value as possible Patriots but spend</text>
  <text start="435.819" dur="3.87">that same money with a good guy instead</text>
  <text start="437.68" dur="3.9">with a white hat company one that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.689" dur="3.72">gonna actually take those funds and put</text>
  <text start="441.58" dur="3.299">them back against big pharma was just</text>
  <text start="443.409" dur="4.951">killing us you know I would say they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="444.879" dur="5.76">actually poisoning us you know my vigil</text>
  <text start="448.36" dur="3.69">plan was to do it as a nonprofit I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.639" dur="3.03">think I can sell health insurance is a</text>
  <text start="452.05" dur="3.839">non-profit unfortunately a little bit</text>
  <text start="453.669" dur="4.86">too much idealism there so I had to</text>
  <text start="455.889" dur="5.13">redirect into a proceeds to model which</text>
  <text start="458.529" dur="4.771">is effectively the same thing I mean I</text>
  <text start="461.019" dur="3.57">cover my cost of doing business if I</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="3.209">spend money obviously there was some</text>
  <text start="464.589" dur="3.48">startup capital involved to help you</text>
  <text start="466.509" dur="3.541">know make sure everything was done with</text>
  <text start="468.069" dur="4.58">with the new businesses and everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.05" dur="5.009">you know tight with the regulations but</text>
  <text start="472.649" dur="5.11">you know I want to be able to do this</text>
  <text start="475.059" dur="4.32">where I don&amp;#39;t get a penny for for myself</text>
  <text start="477.759" dur="4.231">in terms of profit I really want to just</text>
  <text start="479.379" dur="5.85">do this in terms of of giving back to to</text>
  <text start="481.99" dur="6.289">fight big pharma and in so doing help</text>
  <text start="485.229" dur="5.31">Patriots have a weapon for themselves</text>

  <text start="533.8" dur="7.2">going to take away from Big Pharma I I</text>
  <text start="537.82" dur="6.45">don&amp;#39;t believe in drugs and and yet I</text>
  <text start="541" dur="5.7">sell prescription drug plans for people</text>
  <text start="544.27" dur="5.03">that need them and and at this point I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="558.4" dur="5.28">advice to people and I&amp;#39;m not a doctor</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="6.16">but I have a good lay person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.68" dur="5.1">understanding of of what works and what</text>
  <text start="566.47" dur="5.79">doesn&amp;#39;t like I said I&amp;#39;ve experimented on</text>
  <text start="568.78" dur="5.94">myself I&amp;#39;ve you know kind of suggest</text>

  <text start="586.21" dur="5.28">that&amp;#39;s huge for me I agree and I almost</text>
  <text start="589.63" dur="3.93">want to use like a slogan or something</text>
  <text start="591.49" dur="2.7">where our goal is to put ourself out of</text>
  <text start="593.56" dur="3.84">business</text>
  <text start="594.19" dur="5.22">something like that I mean it&amp;#39;s true to</text>
  <text start="597.4" dur="4.62">a sense if we can do that by stopping</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="5.73">Big Pharma entirely in its tracks</text>
  <text start="602.02" dur="5.31">what a what-if victory for the world it</text>
  <text start="605.14" dur="6.15">would be totally worth it but I also</text>
  <text start="607.33" dur="10.8">wanted to ask you about Obamacare yeah</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="12.63">so Obamacare on the exchange well what</text>
  <text start="618.13" dur="11.01">happened was back in 20 2014 there were</text>
  <text start="623.92" dur="7.98">still where I&amp;#39;m at at least a certain</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="5.01">amount of carriers that were open to the</text>
  <text start="631.9" dur="4.89">broker community and they were allowing</text>
  <text start="634.15" dur="6.27">us to sell the same plans that they had</text>
  <text start="636.79" dur="6.21">available on the marketplace as time</text>
  <text start="640.42" dur="5.61">went on those were taken away from the</text>
  <text start="643" dur="5.49">brokerage community and just put on the</text>
  <text start="646.03" dur="5.55">exchange and and as time went on as</text>
  <text start="648.49" dur="6.12">people can attest to those premiums went</text>
  <text start="651.58" dur="7.77">up and those deductibles went up and the</text>
  <text start="654.61" dur="8.399">coverage went down so I have some</text>
  <text start="659.35" dur="8.039">alternatives to Obamacare</text>
  <text start="663.009" dur="9.05">that I can offer people that are less</text>
  <text start="667.389" dur="7.651">expensive they&amp;#39;ve got great coverage</text>
  <text start="672.059" dur="5.111">they you know you you of course have to</text>
  <text start="675.04" dur="4.32">adhere to a provider network as you</text>
  <text start="677.17" dur="4.889">would with with any of the things off</text>
  <text start="679.36" dur="5.099">the exchange but it&amp;#39;s a much more</text>
  <text start="682.059" dur="6.12">especially for people that are you know</text>
  <text start="684.459" dur="7.11">within that 10-year period between you</text>
  <text start="688.179" dur="6.09">know their 50 mid 50s and mid 60s before</text>
  <text start="691.569" dur="6.601">they become eligible for Medicare my god</text>
  <text start="694.269" dur="6.57">yeah the premiums are just through the</text>
  <text start="698.17" dur="4.289">roof and get ripped off yeah totally and</text>
  <text start="700.839" dur="3.54">if you have a family</text>
  <text start="702.459" dur="5.19">same thing you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re just like ouch</text>
  <text start="704.379" dur="5.911">and you&amp;#39;re by the time you you pay the</text>
  <text start="707.649" dur="4.651">deductible and the super high premiums</text>
  <text start="710.29" dur="3.779">that you&amp;#39;ve been paying all year it you</text>
  <text start="712.3" dur="5.849">know it&amp;#39;s November December maybe you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="714.069" dur="6.36">your deductible times two or more for</text>
  <text start="718.149" dur="6.271">the family has been met and you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="720.429" dur="6.75">you know a month to run to the doctor</text>
  <text start="724.42" dur="4.339">and just pay co-pays it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="727.179" dur="3.45">ridiculous it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it was</text>
  <text start="728.759" dur="5.74">unsustainable from the beginning I knew</text>
  <text start="730.629" dur="7.65">that I said my little warnings and then</text>
  <text start="734.499" dur="6.121">I kept my mouth shut because I just did</text>
  <text start="738.279" dur="4.321">anyway so it is it is a heartbreaking</text>
  <text start="740.62" dur="3.569">situation we&amp;#39;re in and as a millennial</text>
  <text start="742.6" dur="3.089">I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and say on the other end</text>
  <text start="744.189" dur="3.24">of this like we don&amp;#39;t even get health</text>
  <text start="745.689" dur="4.26">insurance we don&amp;#39;t even try most of the</text>
  <text start="747.429" dur="4.59">time unless it&amp;#39;s through an employer as</text>
  <text start="749.949" dur="3.87">a self-employed entrepreneurial person</text>
  <text start="752.019" dur="4.62">I&amp;#39;ve never had health insurance</text>
  <text start="753.819" dur="5.101">I mean maybe catastrophic something I</text>
  <text start="756.639" dur="4.351">would like something like that but for</text>
  <text start="758.92" dur="4.169">us it&amp;#39;s not even usually in the cards to</text>
  <text start="760.99" dur="3.93">get and and for those who want to get it</text>
  <text start="763.089" dur="5.04">obviously Obamacare was really messing</text>
  <text start="764.92" dur="4.68">it up for people and you&amp;#39;re there on the</text>
  <text start="768.129" dur="2.88">other side of that like if they had</text>
  <text start="769.6" dur="3.209">allowed you in the free market to where</text>
  <text start="771.009" dur="6.89">costs would have been down quality would</text>
  <text start="772.809" dur="7.5">have gone up yes and you know I keep</text>
  <text start="777.899" dur="5.771">what I what we have to offer right now</text>
  <text start="780.309" dur="8.041">is more of an indemnity plan with with a</text>
  <text start="783.67" dur="6.599">certain amount of fixed PCP visits</text>
  <text start="788.35" dur="4.199">embedded within them throughout the year</text>
  <text start="790.269" dur="6.591">to help keep the cost down and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="792.549" dur="7.171">not quote-unquote ACA compliant which</text>
  <text start="796.86" dur="4.75">really the only the only thing that</text>
  <text start="799.72" dur="6.45">doesn&amp;#39;t make them ACA compliant is</text>
  <text start="801.61" dur="6.15">there&amp;#39;s no maternity so you know a lot</text>
  <text start="806.17" dur="4.039">of people really don&amp;#39;t care about that</text>
  <text start="807.76" dur="4.829">especially if you&amp;#39;re older like myself</text>
  <text start="810.209" dur="4.601">I&amp;#39;m not gonna be popping out any kids</text>
  <text start="812.589" dur="5.071">again any time soon so</text>
  <text start="814.81" dur="4.469">and there&amp;#39;s the the 63 different things</text>
  <text start="817.66" dur="5.13">that could be addressed during the</text>
  <text start="819.279" dur="6.601">course of an annual exam I have been</text>
  <text start="822.79" dur="5.52">shortened it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a smaller list of</text>
  <text start="825.88" dur="4.59">things but it&amp;#39;s still fairly robust the</text>
  <text start="828.31" dur="3.87">most common things that people want to</text>
  <text start="830.47" dur="4.38">have checked during their annual exam</text>
  <text start="832.18" dur="5.099">are covered so you get a higher value</text>
  <text start="834.85" dur="6">because you trim some of the useless fat</text>
  <text start="837.279" dur="6.151">correct and the the other thing is the</text>
  <text start="840.85" dur="5.91">prescription drug coverage it&amp;#39;s strictly</text>
  <text start="843.43" dur="8.19">a reimbursement for generic and brand</text>
  <text start="846.76" dur="7.23">drugs so again I tell people good rx is</text>
  <text start="851.62" dur="5.94">a wonderful thing to go online and use</text>
  <text start="853.99" dur="6.209">their coupons there&amp;#39;s other alternative</text>
  <text start="857.56" dur="5.579">sites that people can go to for free and</text>
  <text start="860.199" dur="6.211">get discount cards to help with their</text>
  <text start="863.139" dur="7.771">drug costs I&amp;#39;m all about you know</text>
  <text start="866.41" dur="8.97">whatever works to help people trim trim</text>
  <text start="870.91" dur="6">down their financial exposure very cool</text>
  <text start="875.38" dur="3.84">yeah and I want to bring as much value</text>
  <text start="876.91" dur="3.869">as possible that&amp;#39;s kind of my motto in</text>
  <text start="879.22" dur="3.66">life just to help people as much as I</text>
  <text start="880.779" dur="3.93">can and and everything else works itself</text>
  <text start="882.88" dur="3.84">out with capitalism and and when when</text>
  <text start="884.709" dur="3.75">and and just voluntary interaction but</text>
  <text start="886.72" dur="3.72">you know I&amp;#39;m just so excited to be part</text>
  <text start="888.459" dur="3.421">of this because I think that with the</text>
  <text start="890.44" dur="3.48">with the where we go when we go all</text>
  <text start="891.88" dur="4.319">movement and and the the all you know</text>
  <text start="893.92" dur="4.349">the alternative health movement and and</text>
  <text start="896.199" dur="4.801">some of the Patriots out there that are</text>
  <text start="898.269" dur="4.38">just so fed up and angry I think that</text>
  <text start="901" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re gonna choose to act on this I</text>
  <text start="902.649" dur="2.911">think that many of them are gonna choose</text>
  <text start="904.06" dur="3.839">to support this with their dollars and</text>
  <text start="905.56" dur="4.29">then kind of I realize it&amp;#39;s probably a</text>
  <text start="907.899" dur="4.62">headache to switcher your provider over</text>
  <text start="909.85" dur="4.65">but man if they go through us like I</text>
  <text start="912.519" dur="4.201">can&amp;#39;t wait to call up like Andy</text>
  <text start="914.5" dur="5.22">Wakefield or or bill big tree or someone</text>
  <text start="916.72" dur="5.07">and say hey guys funding is here you</text>
  <text start="919.72" dur="4.95">know I can&amp;#39;t wait do something or or</text>
  <text start="921.79" dur="4.77">maybe go to dr. Burzynski down in Texas</text>
  <text start="924.67" dur="4.169">and say buddy look you&amp;#39;ve got that</text>
  <text start="926.56" dur="3.42">cancer cure that&amp;#39;s already through the</text>
  <text start="928.839" dur="2.551">FDA approved trials</text>
  <text start="929.98" dur="2.64">even trying to crush you for 30 years</text>
  <text start="931.39" dur="2.64">would you like to get that through the</text>
  <text start="932.62" dur="3.96">trials do you like a couple million</text>
  <text start="934.03" dur="4.83">dollars to get that funded that is now</text>
  <text start="936.58" dur="3.84">doable we could have cancer cure on the</text>
  <text start="938.86" dur="3.9">market this year things like that could</text>
  <text start="940.42" dur="3.72">be done or or however long it takes them</text>
  <text start="942.76" dur="3.48">to go through the trials movie this year</text>
  <text start="944.14" dur="3.87">I imagine but you know we could at least</text>
  <text start="946.24" dur="4.14">get the ball rolling this year because</text>
  <text start="948.01" dur="4.2">millions of patriots times a little bit</text>
  <text start="950.38" dur="5.07">of money here for things are already</text>
  <text start="952.21" dur="5.25">buying is this any problem including</text>
  <text start="955.45" dur="3.74">like you said people that are being</text>
  <text start="957.46" dur="3.9">demonetised like journalists like myself</text>
  <text start="959.19" dur="3.97">like if there was an affiliate program</text>
  <text start="961.36" dur="3.12">where our audience could buy things like</text>
  <text start="963.16" dur="3.24">this through it if they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="964.48" dur="3.87">buying maybe save some money or at least</text>
  <text start="966.4" dur="4.74">get a good value product from a patriot</text>
  <text start="968.35" dur="5">that would change the game for all of us</text>
  <text start="971.14" dur="5.54">I mean most people are out there selling</text>
  <text start="973.35" dur="5.8">low value 500 watt flashlights or</text>
  <text start="976.68" dur="4.06">collectible coins or VPNs that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="979.15" dur="3.84">work things like that that&amp;#39;s my usual</text>
  <text start="980.74" dur="3.86">go-to examples but there&amp;#39;s a variety of</text>
  <text start="982.99" dur="4.11">things that they&amp;#39;re selling it could be</text>
  <text start="984.6" dur="6.13">capturing everything that their their</text>
  <text start="987.1" dur="6">audience is is buying from Amazon or</text>
  <text start="990.73" dur="4.14">something right now and channeling it to</text>
  <text start="993.1" dur="3.48">a good cause or at least to channel it</text>
  <text start="994.87" dur="4.26">to the good guys of course the good guys</text>
  <text start="996.58" dur="5.01">you know the white hat knowing that a</text>
  <text start="999.13" dur="7.62">portion of the I mean people are buying</text>
  <text start="1001.59" dur="7.98">insurance anyway health insurance so why</text>
  <text start="1006.75" dur="6.48">not go to a place where they they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1009.57" dur="5.55">going to pay get a get a decent plan and</text>
  <text start="1013.23" dur="4.2">know that a portion of that proceeds is</text>
  <text start="1015.12" dur="5.76">going to help further the conservative</text>
  <text start="1017.43" dur="5.25">cause I think that&amp;#39;s amazing that that</text>
  <text start="1020.88" dur="4.38">just makes my heart sing</text>
  <text start="1022.68" dur="6.75">I&amp;#39;ve got I&amp;#39;ve got a daughter I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1025.26" dur="8.16">grandchildren I I want to see this world</text>
