  <text start="0.979" dur="5.441">let&amp;#39;s redo that entire video because it</text>
  <text start="3.75" dur="4.319">didn&amp;#39;t record all right here we go again</text>
  <text start="6.42" dur="2.759">something for some reason if you know</text>
  <text start="8.069" dur="4.501">how to fix this please let me know my</text>
  <text start="9.179" dur="4.651">camera a screen if I minimize it it</text>
  <text start="12.57" dur="3.78">quits recording I don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="13.83" dur="3.81">it didn&amp;#39;t used to do that so let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="16.35" dur="3.03">what do we have to go through a couple</text>
  <text start="17.64" dur="5.25">of days worth of stuff I want to cover</text>
  <text start="19.38" dur="6">briefly we have the interstate 80 arson</text>
  <text start="22.89" dur="6.11">where a lefty attorney was caught</text>
  <text start="25.38" dur="6.54">basically starting some of these fires</text>
  <text start="29" dur="4.75">we have the queuing on conspiracy</text>
  <text start="31.92" dur="4.319">theorists who was arrested which makes</text>
  <text start="33.75" dur="4.37">no sense for starting fires like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="36.239" dur="3.57">calling it the holy fire or whatever but</text>
  <text start="38.12" dur="3.34">first of all let&amp;#39;s go through the</text>
  <text start="39.809" dur="3.84">reasoning of this why would aq non</text>
  <text start="41.46" dur="4.86">person who&amp;#39;s probably a trump supporter</text>
  <text start="43.649" dur="4.291">obviously why would he burn out people</text>
  <text start="46.32" dur="3.93">in rural areas which are probably Trump</text>
  <text start="47.94" dur="5.009">supporters as well it makes no sense and</text>
  <text start="50.25" dur="4.289">and really it&amp;#39;s an easy thing to counter</text>
  <text start="52.949" dur="4.971">if you hear someone using this argument</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="5.881">be like look you show me we&amp;#39;re cueing on</text>
  <text start="57.92" dur="4.15">encourages or advocates or says to or</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="3.629">commands or whatever for people to go</text>
  <text start="62.07" dur="4.11">commit arson and I will help you resist</text>
  <text start="64.049" dur="4.021">cue and on they can&amp;#39;t do it so don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="4.2">hold your breath that&amp;#39;s the appropriate</text>
  <text start="68.07" dur="4.47">response to that and if they keep going</text>
  <text start="70.38" dur="3.63">you know you can you can just use a</text>
  <text start="72.54" dur="5.34">little bit of a pill to ridicule memes</text>
  <text start="74.01" dur="8.399">in a polite way we also have mystery</text>
  <text start="77.88" dur="7.62">deepens as the DOJ to round trips in the</text>
  <text start="82.409" dur="4.561">48 okay so this is about the the 757 in</text>
  <text start="85.5" dur="5.189">Little Rock Arkansas you may not have</text>
  <text start="86.97" dur="6.359">heard that there was a second trip okay</text>
  <text start="90.689" dur="4.351">so basically smart money is that this</text>
  <text start="93.329" dur="3.691">was rounding up a whole bunch of Clinton</text>
  <text start="95.04" dur="4.59">investigation documents okay this is a</text>
  <text start="97.02" dur="5.55">big deal as well and I don&amp;#39;t trust the</text>
  <text start="99.63" dur="5.25">FBI as far as I can throw a boulder but</text>
  <text start="102.57" dur="3.869">at the same point maybe they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="104.88" dur="2.91">quite as bad out in the rural area here</text>
  <text start="106.439" dur="2.941">I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know we&amp;#39;ll see maybe</text>
  <text start="107.79" dur="3.149">Trump had something on it but they had a</text>
  <text start="109.38" dur="3.51">lot of documents come forward will</text>
  <text start="110.939" dur="4.86">hopefully get to see some of those in</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="5.82">the future now let&amp;#39;s see where are we we</text>
  <text start="115.799" dur="4.68">also have Jeff Sessions the DOJ will not</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="3.54">partner with groups that unfairly defame</text>
  <text start="120.479" dur="3.901">Americans like the Southern Poverty Law</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="4.439">Center basically just a hate they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="3.51">really defending poor people in the</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="2.94">south or anything they&amp;#39;re just a hate</text>
  <text start="127.89" dur="4.38">group trying to create racial division</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="3.871">and and and basically label everyone as</text>
  <text start="132.27" dur="3.36">hate speech so that they can say</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="3.3">with them this is the justification a</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="4.17">lot of these big tech companies are</text>
  <text start="136.8" dur="5.73">using so calling SPLC outs a big deal</text>
