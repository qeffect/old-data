  <text start="89.13" dur="6.48">of goes back really have to go back to</text>
  <text start="90.72" dur="6.99">about what 1990 96 97 ish there was a</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="5.28">rather forward-thinking doctor by the</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="5.369">name of Bruce Halsted and he wanted to</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="4.56">he was working in the Dominican Republic</text>
  <text start="103.079" dur="3.75">he was actually really good he&amp;#39;s he went</text>
  <text start="105.45" dur="4.199">all over the world he was it was all</text>
  <text start="106.829" dur="4.411">over the third-world Africa South</text>
  <text start="109.649" dur="3.72">America anyway he was he was down in the</text>
  <text start="111.24" dur="4.65">Dominican Republic and he came across a</text>
  <text start="113.369" dur="4.35">lot of children who were who had high</text>
  <text start="115.89" dur="5.07">that they were next to a battery factory</text>
  <text start="117.719" dur="6.991">live near a battery factory and they had</text>
  <text start="120.96" dur="7.37">a lot of lead toxicity so he was as a</text>
  <text start="124.71" dur="6.24">doctor he was aware of chelation therapy</text>
  <text start="128.33" dur="6.129">but chelation therapy up until that</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="5.429">point really was limited to</text>
  <text start="134.459" dur="3.39">intravenous therapy it was something</text>
  <text start="136.379" dur="3.571">that you know intravenous means that</text>
  <text start="137.849" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s invasive you have to hook</text>
  <text start="139.95" dur="7.02">somebody up to it to an IV you get a you</text>
  <text start="143.819" dur="7.801">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s time-consuming it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="6.989">it&amp;#39;s expensive in in just in our world</text>
  <text start="151.62" dur="6.81">right now an average therapy is about a</text>
  <text start="153.959" dur="7.17">hundred $150 and it&amp;#39;s about you know</text>
  <text start="158.43" dur="5.97">three to four hours of time to sit there</text>
  <text start="161.129" dur="6.871">in a recliner while while the medication</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="6.419">drips into your body but you don&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="168" dur="4.95">do one you need like 30 in order to get</text>
  <text start="170.819" dur="3.45">a full complement so you know you have</text>
  <text start="172.95" dur="3.509">to do that you know twice a week for</text>
  <text start="174.269" dur="4.08">however long it takes you to do 30 and</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="5.67">if it&amp;#39;s you know if it&amp;#39;s $100 zzmatt</text>
  <text start="178.349" dur="6.841">100 times 30 is $3,000 so it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.129" dur="4.11">expensive it&amp;#39;s time-consuming people a</text>
  <text start="185.19" dur="2.579">lot of people just don&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="186.239" dur="6.901">unless they&amp;#39;re actually acutely led</text>
  <text start="187.769" dur="7.291">toxic he wanted to do the chelation</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="5.189">therapy with these children but he</text>
  <text start="195.06" dur="4.62">wanted to do it in a suppository so he</text>
  <text start="198.329" dur="2.97">came to my dad he knew he was a</text>
  <text start="199.68" dur="3.27">compounding pharmacist he came to him</text>
  <text start="201.299" dur="3.181">and he&amp;#39;s like hey could we can we do</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="5.09">this and how long did it take you but</text>
  <text start="204.48" dur="6.089">two years we were kind of just making</text>
  <text start="208.04" dur="6.309">suppositories over and over and over a</text>
  <text start="210.569" dur="5.64">lot of them and you know what can I say</text>
  <text start="214.349" dur="3.57">we just made a lot of suppositories for</text>
  <text start="216.209" dur="3.75">these kids I think but it took it took</text>
  <text start="217.919" dur="5.641">about two years though to perfected if</text>
  <text start="219.959" dur="6.331">memory serves correctly and then once</text>
  <text start="223.56" dur="4.769">they got well once I got perfected we</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="3.96">took it down and tried it on these kids</text>
  <text start="228.329" dur="4.56">and they actually did a study a peer</text>
  <text start="230.25" dur="4.29">review study on it and they they took to</text>
  <text start="232.889" dur="5.22">it like fish to heart when it went</text>
  <text start="234.54" dur="4.349">really really well that&amp;#39;s kind of where</text>
  <text start="238.109" dur="3.78">we started</text>
  <text start="238.889" dur="6.061">I was I was involved in a couple of</text>
  <text start="241.889" dur="9.78">suppository projects early in in the</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="8.61">2000s that kind of wound down but I</text>
  <text start="251.669" dur="4.051">wanted to bring this I wanted to I</text>
  <text start="253.56" dur="5.37">wanted to bring something really solid</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="5.729">to market and during the time that we</text>
  <text start="258.93" dur="5.88">were doing this and the early to the mid</text>
  <text start="261.449" dur="6.341">2000s we wanted to do a cream but it</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="4.51">just it took a while to get it to get to</text>
  <text start="267.79" dur="2.76">perfected they get the crane perfected</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="4.53">it was a long and arduous process</text>
  <text start="270.55" dur="8.63">finally I don&amp;#39;t even know what it really</text>
  <text start="273.85" dur="5.33">came from I was about 2015</text>
  <text start="280.24" dur="4.53">I got a hold of the manufacturer</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="4.05">actually the manufacturer got a hold of</text>
  <text start="284.77" dur="4.77">me and there was somebody who had been</text>
  <text start="287.38" dur="4.23">who&amp;#39;ve been using it and he&amp;#39;s like hey I</text>
  <text start="289.54" dur="4.77">want to you have any interest in this</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="5.76">and I said yeah actually I do so we</text>
  <text start="294.31" dur="6.27">brought it back out and we called it</text>
  <text start="297.37" dur="7.77">teal green for chelation cream obviously</text>
  <text start="300.58" dur="8.31">and it&amp;#39;s a really really good product</text>
  <text start="305.14" dur="6.3">especially now with all of the all of</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="4.35">the press coming out there for lead</text>
  <text start="311.44" dur="3.96">toxicity everywhere right now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.24" dur="3.78">there&amp;#39;s the Flint Michigan crisis and</text>
  <text start="315.4" dur="3.21">then people don&amp;#39;t realize that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="317.02" dur="5.73">just one that got the attention there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="318.61" dur="6.3">actually Atlanta Georgia comes to mind</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="3.93">recently within the next couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="324.91" dur="3.81">or a month or so it was the Chicago I</text>
  <text start="326.68" dur="4.74">think talked about all out the the lead</text>
  <text start="328.72" dur="4.62">toxicity and the pipes in Chicago and</text>
  <text start="331.42" dur="6.3">and then you know there&amp;#39;s a there was a</text>
  <text start="333.34" dur="6.75">study that came out by The Lancet in but</text>
  <text start="337.72" dur="4.17">this time last year where they talk</text>
  <text start="340.09" dur="3.6">about they attributed almost 400,000</text>
  <text start="341.89" dur="4.8">deaths annually in the United States to</text>
  <text start="343.69" dur="4.56">lead to lead toxicity and the two to</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="3.6">three weeks ago was an article in the on</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="4.41">NBC not that I trust and we see very</text>
  <text start="350.29" dur="5.07">much on the health side I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="352.66" dur="4.02">they can really get it wrong but when</text>
  <text start="355.36" dur="2.06">this bad news they&amp;#39;re usually pretty</text>
  <text start="356.68" dur="6.48">good about it</text>
  <text start="357.42" dur="9.34">exactly the but NBC talked about how the</text>
  <text start="363.16" dur="4.8">lead lead is the is silent or is is a</text>
  <text start="366.76" dur="4.77">big contributing factor to</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="6">cardiovascular disease hypertension so</text>
  <text start="371.53" dur="3.87">and we know that just because what what</text>
  <text start="373.96" dur="3.15">the lead does is when it gets into the</text>
  <text start="375.4" dur="5.07">into the arteries it basically</text>
  <text start="377.11" dur="5.91">constricts the vessels on the artery so</text>
  <text start="380.47" dur="4.68">if you know it it&amp;#39;s kind of like I was</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="3.54">using the example of a straw you have</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="4.74">you ever you ever blown through one of</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="4.86">those tiny little stirring straws of</text>
  <text start="389.89" dur="3.6">coffee stirring straws and your cheeks</text>
  <text start="391.42" dur="5.82">your cheeks hurt you know talking about</text>
  <text start="393.49" dur="5.82">yeah it&amp;#39;s the one your Bloods pumping</text>
  <text start="397.24" dur="3.48">when your heart&amp;#39;s pumping your blood</text>
  <text start="399.31" dur="2.219">it&amp;#39;s your blood is going through that</text>
  <text start="400.72" dur="2.609">straw</text>
  <text start="401.529" dur="3.87">if you blow through a boba straw it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.329" dur="3.87">easy because there&amp;#39;s no pressure on your</text>
  <text start="405.399" dur="4.02">cheeks but when you blow into that tiny</text>
  <text start="407.199" dur="3.72">little straw the stirring straw it puts</text>
  <text start="409.419" dur="2.85">pressure on your cheeks and that&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="410.919" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s the best way I can articulate</text>
  <text start="412.269" dur="5.61">that the you your your heart is your</text>
  <text start="415.539" dur="4.65">cheeks and the harder it works to push</text>
  <text start="417.879" dur="4.2">through the through that tiny little to</text>
  <text start="420.189" dur="3.6">that straw though the less the less</text>
  <text start="422.079" dur="3.66">stress on your cheeks is less stress on</text>
  <text start="423.789" dur="5.16">your heart so you want to have big</text>
  <text start="425.739" dur="5.7">wide-open blood vessels and so I guess</text>
  <text start="428.949" dur="4.59">and that the in computer terms its</text>
  <text start="431.439" dur="5.07">bandwidth you know you would bandwidth</text>
  <text start="433.539" dur="6.23">you have lower back you have the the</text>
  <text start="436.509" dur="7.35">better it is on the computer and so for</text>
  <text start="439.769" dur="5.38">for people who are not necessarily into</text>
  <text start="443.859" dur="2.73">the old health movement maybe they</text>
  <text start="445.149" dur="3.87">haven&amp;#39;t really heard about all of this</text>
  <text start="446.589" dur="3.6">in the past there&amp;#39;s various heavy metals</text>
  <text start="449.019" dur="2.91">out there that cause a lot of damage</text>
  <text start="450.189" dur="4.65">lead is kind of the one we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="451.929" dur="4.44">about but you know mercury I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="454.839" dur="5.6">if aluminum is considered a heavy metal</text>
  <text start="456.369" dur="6.78">but it is aluminum cadmium nickel boron</text>
  <text start="460.439" dur="5.11">you know there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of them</text>
  <text start="463.149" dur="5.67">out there you know people who cadmium is</text>
  <text start="465.549" dur="5.19">a is a lesser-known one but people who</text>
  <text start="468.819" dur="5.13">generally live within about a mile</text>
  <text start="470.739" dur="6.15">radius of a freeway can expect to have</text>
  <text start="473.949" dur="6.15">higher cadmium levels than others just</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="5.7">by virtue of the of the auto dust yeah</text>
  <text start="480.099" dur="4.02">okay so these heavy metals do a lot of</text>
  <text start="482.589" dur="3.69">damage in the body has a really hard</text>
  <text start="484.119" dur="4.08">time dealing with them correct there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.279" dur="3.3">only a few things that our body can do</text>
  <text start="488.199" dur="4.41">when it comes to heavy metals and</text>
  <text start="489.579" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s really no quick fix for that</text>
  <text start="492.609" dur="5.79">damage it&amp;#39;s difficult to get the body to</text>
  <text start="495.069" dur="5.52">chelate them out or move them out the</text>
  <text start="498.399" dur="6.09">body doesn&amp;#39;t the the body really does</text>
  <text start="500.589" dur="6.15">not have a natural mechanism to get rid</text>
  <text start="504.489" dur="4.89">of heavy metals on its own there is a</text>
  <text start="506.739" dur="5.311">mechanism but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like one step</text>
  <text start="509.379" dur="6.44">forward 20 steps back it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="512.05" dur="6.269">cannot keep up with the daily deluge of</text>
  <text start="515.819" dur="3.791">of heavy metals that were exposed to I</text>
  <text start="518.319" dur="3.21">mean we&amp;#39;re exposed to them from the</text>
  <text start="519.61" dur="6.24">water from from the water we drink the</text>
  <text start="521.529" dur="7.47">food we eat the water that&amp;#39;s used to you</text>
  <text start="525.85" dur="6.12">know to grow the food that we eat you</text>
  <text start="528.999" dur="4.59">know it&amp;#39;s in the air there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="531.97" dur="3.78">tiny little particles of lead and</text>
  <text start="533.589" dur="4.801">mercury in and all the</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="5.46">that we read so you know we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="538.39" dur="5.43">bombarded daily with with these heavy</text>
  <text start="541.21" dur="4.02">metals and the body just doesn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="543.82" dur="2.61">way to get rid of them and with it if it</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="4.32">doesn&amp;#39;t get rid of them then they just</text>
  <text start="546.43" dur="7.08">accumulate so you know for guys and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="7.11">I&amp;#39;ll be 50 next year and when we get</text>
  <text start="553.51" dur="6.15">older you know I&amp;#39;ve got 50 years of</text>
  <text start="556.66" dur="5.1">accumulation time of heavy metals so I</text>
  <text start="559.66" dur="4.2">mean I feel pretty good about my heavy</text>
  <text start="561.76" dur="3.75">metals where I am heavy metal just</text>
  <text start="563.86" dur="3.48">because I&amp;#39;m doing the chelation all the</text>
  <text start="565.51" dur="4.08">time I basically do it every day</text>
  <text start="567.34" dur="3.57">I almost suggest that this is so this is</text>
  <text start="569.59" dur="3.3">almost as important as brushing your</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="4.65">teeth when we brush or we brush our</text>
  <text start="572.89" dur="4.65">teeth to get rid of of you know the</text>
  <text start="575.56" dur="3.39">bacteria in our mouth well what about a</text>
  <text start="577.54" dur="3.39">heavy metals that are accumulating that</text>
  <text start="578.95" dur="3.21">we can&amp;#39;t get rid of we know this is</text>
  <text start="580.93" dur="3.06">almost as important as brushing your</text>
  <text start="582.16" dur="4.44">teeth at least from you know from as</text>

  <text start="690.67" dur="3.87">will add you know some people they have</text>

  <text start="833.27" dur="7.509">but you know we believe that this idea</text>
  <text start="837.12" dur="6.63">of using a cream is convenient it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="840.779" dur="4.68">something that people can do you know</text>
  <text start="843.75" dur="4.589">the seminars and things I&amp;#39;ve gone to in</text>
  <text start="845.459" dur="5.551">my lifetime you end up on Monday morning</text>
  <text start="848.339" dur="5.041">when you get back to your job you end up</text>
  <text start="851.01" dur="4.53">saying to yourself okay what am I gonna</text>

  <text start="859.17" dur="3.81">something they can do is it something</text>
  <text start="860.61" dur="5.27">they want to do so this is simple to do</text>
  <text start="862.98" dur="5.4">I talked about this being something</text>
  <text start="865.88" dur="4.72">usually the mothers in the family are</text>
  <text start="868.38" dur="4.56">the doctors maybe in your situation is</text>
  <text start="870.6" dur="4.56">different but most of the time the moms</text>
  <text start="872.94" dur="4.35">are the ones that are out there you know</text>
  <text start="875.16" dur="4.049">get the kids to the doctor and getting</text>
  <text start="877.29" dur="4.799">their medicines and all those types of</text>
  <text start="879.209" dur="5.37">things so I envision this something that</text>
  <text start="882.089" dur="4.831">a mom is getting the kids ready for bed</text>
  <text start="884.579" dur="4.531">and they could put a little cream on a</text>
  <text start="886.92" dur="5.13">bedtime that sort of things something</text>
  <text start="889.11" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s convenient effective and something</text>
  <text start="892.05" dur="4.38">they can do you know you you know people</text>

  <text start="1272.78" dur="4.56">is a lot of those kids are so damaged</text>

  <text start="1277.34" dur="5.33">they&amp;#39;ve been exposed to I just go ahead</text>
  <text start="1279.91" dur="6.55">you know that&amp;#39;s our the other thing that</text>
  <text start="1282.67" dur="5.53">we believe is that people should take</text>
  <text start="1286.46" dur="4.23">responsibility for their health and</text>
  <text start="1288.2" dur="3.93">hopefully the people that are you know</text>

  <text start="1292.13" dur="3.39">say oh wow that might be something I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1293.66" dur="5.16">be interested in those are the people</text>
  <text start="1295.52" dur="6.54">that realize that you know the doctor</text>
  <text start="1298.82" dur="5.28">ain&amp;#39;t going to it get he the system it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1302.06" dur="4.43">not the doctor so much as it is the</text>
  <text start="1304.1" dur="4.68">system you know I know many Doc&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="1306.49" dur="4.14">this is different than it was when I</text>
  <text start="1308.78" dur="5.37">first started practicing pharmacy in</text>
  <text start="1310.63" dur="6.1">1966 it&amp;#39;s a different it&amp;#39;s hard on them</text>
  <text start="1314.15" dur="4.86">they they work in a system that&amp;#39;s closed</text>
  <text start="1316.73" dur="4.98">they have to do certain things and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1319.01" dur="4.71">that way all up and down the line people</text>
  <text start="1321.71" dur="4.59">realize that the doctors can&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="1323.72" dur="5.37">so we&amp;#39;re hoping to educate people we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1326.3" dur="5.37">hoping to raise their awareness of this</text>
  <text start="1329.09" dur="4.32">if if you know you watching this little</text>
  <text start="1331.67" dur="3.28">video and you&amp;#39;re out there thinking well</text>
  <text start="1333.41" dur="3.7">I never heard of that again well</text>
  <text start="1334.95" dur="3.63">they start looking around look at the at</text>
  <text start="1337.11" dur="3.54">the places you can get some information</text>
  <text start="1338.58" dur="4.32">and then kind of make a determination</text>
  <text start="1340.65" dur="4.32">well I wonder how that&amp;#39;s impacting me</text>
  <text start="1342.9" dur="4.86">and my husband and my kids and my mom</text>
  <text start="1344.97" dur="5.94">and dad and the people around me because</text>
  <text start="1347.76" dur="6.18">moms can have a real of just a huge</text>
  <text start="1350.91" dur="4.65">effect on their families so anyway we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1353.94" dur="4.05">looking for people that are looking I</text>
  <text start="1355.56" dur="5.73">guess that&amp;#39;s the best way to put it yeah</text>
  <text start="1357.99" dur="5.16">and you know I don&amp;#39;t want to give</text>
  <text start="1361.29" dur="4.65">anybody you know unrealistic</text>
  <text start="1363.15" dur="4.17">expectations or anything but getting</text>
  <text start="1365.94" dur="3.81">getting the heavy metals out it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1367.32" dur="6.03">gonna hurt it so it&amp;#39;s only it&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="1369.75" dur="4.98">gonna help you know and and I&amp;#39;m often</text>
  <text start="1373.35" dur="4.31">asked well what am I going to feel when</text>
  <text start="1374.73" dur="7.08">I take the cream what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="1377.66" dur="6.43">initially you might get a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1381.81" dur="4.32">I get a little headache maybe a little</text>
  <text start="1384.09" dur="3.87">feeling of kind of just general malaise</text>
  <text start="1386.13" dur="5.87">or whatever but I mean that that is a</text>
  <text start="1387.96" dur="6.99">transient effect of the detoxification</text>
  <text start="1392" dur="5.62">process and you&amp;#39;ll feel it maybe just</text>
  <text start="1394.95" dur="4.8">initially but it will last maybe a day</text>
  <text start="1397.62" dur="4.95">and maybe a little bit longer but</text>
  <text start="1399.75" dur="4.83">unlikely and it goes away and then</text>
  <text start="1402.57" dur="4.53">outside of that you&amp;#39;re not really gonna</text>
  <text start="1404.58" dur="4.11">know that it&amp;#39;s doing anything you just</text>
  <text start="1407.1" dur="3.42">have to have faith that what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1408.69" dur="4.98">putting on there is helping your body</text>
  <text start="1410.52" dur="6.77">get rid of of the garbage that&amp;#39;s on the</text>
  <text start="1413.67" dur="7.14">inside just the other thing that I as a</text>
  <text start="1417.29" dur="6.12">nutritionist once that to convey to</text>
  <text start="1420.81" dur="5.28">people is that they need to keep the</text>
  <text start="1423.41" dur="6.79">pathways in the body that are used to</text>
  <text start="1426.09" dur="6.51">excreting things clean and functioning</text>
  <text start="1430.2" dur="5.04">properly so that means the liver that</text>
  <text start="1432.6" dur="4.92">means the kidneys you can do that a</text>
  <text start="1435.24" dur="4.26">couple of ways but number one you want</text>
  <text start="1437.52" dur="3.24">to be sure when you&amp;#39;re using this well</text>
  <text start="1439.5" dur="2.85">all the time but you want to be sure</text>
  <text start="1440.76" dur="4.95">you&amp;#39;re drinking a lot of water to keep</text>
  <text start="1442.35" dur="7.01">your body flushed and and you know water</text>
  <text start="1445.71" dur="6.45">is what I call a volume diuretic a</text>
  <text start="1449.36" dur="4.12">volume diuretic yeah you know people</text>
  <text start="1452.16" dur="2.82">drink a lot of one of this and I think a</text>
  <text start="1453.48" dur="3.57">lot of water I drink a gallon a date</text>
  <text start="1454.98" dur="3.69">well if you drink a gallon a day of</text>
  <text start="1457.05" dur="3.81">water you&amp;#39;re going to pee out more than</text>
  <text start="1458.67" dur="4.17">a doubt because water is a volume</text>
  <text start="1460.86" dur="4.62">diuretic so you can get things out of</text>
  <text start="1462.84" dur="4.43">your body just by using a lot of water</text>
  <text start="1465.48" dur="3.42">and then you can take some supplements</text>
  <text start="1467.27" dur="4.83">you know</text>
  <text start="1468.9" dur="6.96">there are so many things that we could</text>
  <text start="1472.1" dur="6.55">convey that would help the liver get rid</text>
  <text start="1475.86" dur="5.13">of whatever toxin is dealing with but I</text>
  <text start="1478.65" dur="4.14">kind of make it easy for people go out</text>
  <text start="1480.99" dur="2.7">there and find yourselves a really</text>
  <text start="1482.79" dur="3.36">high-quality</text>
  <text start="1483.69" dur="6.63">in fact the most expensive one you can</text>
  <text start="1486.15" dur="6.9">buy broccoli extract so forth BAM</text>
  <text start="1490.32" dur="4.71">broccoli extra and use that all the time</text>
  <text start="1493.05" dur="3.99">use it all the time all the time because</text>
  <text start="1495.03" dur="4.26">that helps with what because they phase</text>
  <text start="1497.04" dur="4.29">two detoxification systems in the liver</text>
  <text start="1499.29" dur="5.52">and that&amp;#39;s going to help your liver move</text>
  <text start="1501.33" dur="5.16">things out but it will help not only you</text>
  <text start="1504.81" dur="5.01">know the toxic heavy metals it&amp;#39;ll help</text>
  <text start="1506.49" dur="5.37">other things that glyphosate yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1509.82" dur="3.48">in the body so you never you know we got</text>
  <text start="1511.86" dur="3.78">a lot of things to deal with we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1513.3" dur="4.17">the pesticides the herbicides all the</text>
  <text start="1515.64" dur="3.78">phthalates we you know we have so many</text>
  <text start="1517.47" dur="4.83">things to deal with and those things</text>
  <text start="1519.42" dur="5.64">will have an imposing impact on your</text>
  <text start="1522.3" dur="5.24">body getting rid of that besides the the</text>
  <text start="1525.06" dur="5.88">excretion pathways that water will help</text>
  <text start="1527.54" dur="6.37">kind of speed up I use something called</text>
  <text start="1530.94" dur="4.68">Chong cathedra or also known as</text>
  <text start="1533.91" dur="4.35">Stonebreaker it&amp;#39;s an herb that helps</text>
  <text start="1535.62" dur="5.07">with the diuretics and increasing urine</text>
  <text start="1538.26" dur="4.29">flow to to flush out kidneys and stuff</text>
  <text start="1540.69" dur="5.16">so there&amp;#39;s so many good options like you</text>
  <text start="1542.55" dur="7.89">said with the broccoli extract so one</text>
  <text start="1545.85" dur="6.99">question that comes to mind is obviously</text>
  <text start="1550.44" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s different kinds of chelation the</text>
  <text start="1552.84" dur="3.21">first thing that I ever learned about</text>
  <text start="1554.13" dur="4.32">for detoxing heavy metals was just eat</text>
  <text start="1556.05" dur="5.34">chlorella for 20 years and it slowly</text>
  <text start="1558.45" dur="4.71">slowly slowly you know how long does the</text>
  <text start="1561.39" dur="3.39">usual and obviously it&amp;#39;s going to take a</text>
  <text start="1563.16" dur="3.99">while because it takes a lot of time</text>
  <text start="1564.78" dur="4.62">than about heavy metals but how long</text>
  <text start="1567.15" dur="5.31">does it usually take with this kind of</text>
  <text start="1569.4" dur="5.28">product and also is there a way to</text>
  <text start="1572.46" dur="4.35">measure the results as you go maybe</text>
  <text start="1574.68" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;ve got more your excreting in your</text>
  <text start="1576.81" dur="4.08">urine or something like that is that</text>
  <text start="1578.31" dur="5.43">something is easy to test you know what</text>
  <text start="1580.89" dur="5.25">yes or no or yes and maybe not necessary</text>
  <text start="1583.74" dur="4.08">the amount you&amp;#39;re going to excrete is</text>
  <text start="1586.14" dur="3.93">going to depend on the amount that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1587.82" dur="4.08">the body so if you have a lot to get out</text>
  <text start="1590.07" dur="3.75">and you&amp;#39;re using it then you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1591.9" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;re going to excrete more than the</text>
  <text start="1593.82" dur="4.38">person it doesn&amp;#39;t have so much so some</text>
  <text start="1595.83" dur="6.449">of it depends on what you have in the</text>
  <text start="1598.2" dur="6.689">body and</text>
  <text start="1602.279" dur="5.49">the other thing is you have to look at</text>
  <text start="1604.889" dur="4.86">this is a long-term thing you&amp;#39;d have to</text>
  <text start="1607.769" dur="4.431">say you know I know what I&amp;#39;m doing is</text>
  <text start="1609.749" dur="6.29">right see we know toxic heavy metals</text>
  <text start="1612.2" dur="6.819">have a direct impact on the mitochondria</text>
  <text start="1616.039" dur="5.94">Auto cond Rhea are the energy producing</text>
  <text start="1619.019" dur="5.551">parts of your of your body therein</text>
  <text start="1621.979" dur="5.02">there&amp;#39;s large amounts of mitochondria in</text>
  <text start="1624.57" dur="4.859">the most active parts of the body like</text>
  <text start="1626.999" dur="4.92">the heart the heart has about 5,000</text>
  <text start="1629.429" dur="5.82">mitochondria per cell you get to the fat</text>
  <text start="1631.919" dur="5.88">tissue there&amp;#39;s 200 so the cells that</text>
  <text start="1635.249" dur="4.97">need a lot of injury energy are the ones</text>
  <text start="1637.799" dur="5.07">that have a lot of mitochondria the</text>
  <text start="1640.219" dur="5.71">toxic heavy metals affect the enzyme</text>
  <text start="1642.869" dur="4.35">systems in the mitochondria not only the</text>
  <text start="1645.929" dur="4.29">in the mitochondria but all over the</text>
  <text start="1647.219" dur="6.601">body you know it&amp;#39;s very toxic to the</text>
  <text start="1650.219" dur="6.15">brain it impacts the mitochondrial</text>
  <text start="1653.82" dur="4.26">membranes it can interfere with those</text>
  <text start="1656.369" dur="3.51">and the membranes don&amp;#39;t work very well</text>
  <text start="1658.08" dur="6.929">and then when the mitochondria don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1659.879" dur="7.23">work well then the cell figure tee and</text>
  <text start="1665.009" dur="4.76">literally could die so you want to do</text>
  <text start="1667.109" dur="4.95">the things that are the most helpful</text>
  <text start="1669.769" dur="6.45">again the toxic heavy metals have a</text>
  <text start="1672.059" dur="7.5">really met just a huge negative on</text>
  <text start="1676.219" dur="6.31">membranes of the mitochondria big deal</text>
  <text start="1679.559" dur="5.04">in a Krebs cycle it affects the electron</text>
  <text start="1682.529" dur="5.431">transport chain it does so many things</text>
  <text start="1684.599" dur="5.88">in the body that are that are that are</text>
  <text start="1687.96" dur="4.349">not good one of the things that you</text>
  <text start="1690.479" dur="4.231">learn when you&amp;#39;re reading a lab test and</text>
  <text start="1692.309" dur="4.651">you come across somebody who seems to</text>
  <text start="1694.71" dur="4.23">have everything all together it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1696.96" dur="3.629">look like there&amp;#39;s too much going on but</text>
  <text start="1698.94" dur="4.829">maybe there&amp;#39;d be you in love well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1700.589" dur="5.07">a measure of how well the kidneys are</text>
  <text start="1703.769" dur="4.59">working you look at the being being you</text>
  <text start="1705.659" dur="4.23">in level and I was told by this person</text>
  <text start="1708.359" dur="3.27">who was teaching me this when that</text>
  <text start="1709.889" dur="3.96">happens you&amp;#39;re on your first thing you</text>
  <text start="1711.629" dur="4.441">should think about is there&amp;#39;s some toxic</text>
  <text start="1713.849" dur="3.841">heavy metals in the kidneys that can</text>
  <text start="1716.07" dur="2.969">affect that be you in when it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1717.69" dur="3.989">look like there&amp;#39;s much of anything else</text>
  <text start="1719.039" dur="4.23">going on so we all are so the first</text>
  <text start="1721.679" dur="3.3">thing you want the first thing but the</text>
  <text start="1723.269" dur="4.23">thing you think about is toxic heavy</text>
  <text start="1724.979" dur="6.091">metals can have a negative impact on the</text>
  <text start="1727.499" dur="5.461">functioning of my kidney yeah of course</text>
  <text start="1731.07" dur="4.62">for kids it&amp;#39;s worse and and going back</text>
  <text start="1732.96" dur="5.01">to what you were saying around jr. is</text>
  <text start="1735.69" dur="3.5">mother&amp;#39;s passing it to their children I</text>
  <text start="1737.97" dur="4.77">once heard a study where they had</text>
  <text start="1739.19" dur="5.469">dissected some of the umbilical cords</text>
  <text start="1742.74" dur="3.779">and they were finding an average woman</text>
  <text start="1744.659" dur="3.661">has over 200 chemicals they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1746.519" dur="6.301">supposed to be there right asking it to</text>
  <text start="1748.32" dur="6.51">the baby so you know you said yes or no</text>
  <text start="1752.82" dur="4.319">is it okay to assume that if they had a</text>
  <text start="1754.83" dur="3.929">good baseline before like they did a</text>
  <text start="1757.139" dur="5.601">test of how much they&amp;#39;re getting rid of</text>
  <text start="1758.759" dur="6.931">first and then compares what I know is</text>
  <text start="1762.74" dur="5.23">you know I look at somebody and this</text>
  <text start="1765.69" dur="3.9">person says well you know I I think I</text>
  <text start="1767.97" dur="3.059">have just like you just said you know I</text>
  <text start="1769.59" dur="4.89">have these mercury amount in them I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1771.029" dur="5.37">out for 40 years and and so my thought</text>
  <text start="1774.48" dur="3.299">is well busting you could have that</text>
  <text start="1776.399" dur="3.091">checked if you want you you can pay to</text>
  <text start="1777.779" dur="3.99">have that done you can have the test out</text>
  <text start="1779.49" dur="4.5">or you can just use your common sense</text>
  <text start="1781.769" dur="5.551">and say what do you think you think I</text>
  <text start="1783.99" dur="5.429">might have some mercury toxicity yes so</text>
  <text start="1787.32" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;m not a big one for testing when we</text>
  <text start="1789.419" dur="5.581">when we feel like it&amp;#39;s absolutely no</text>
  <text start="1792.48" dur="4.409">other way around it i I just think okay</text>
  <text start="1795" dur="4.139">you can test if you want but I&amp;#39;m against</text>
  <text start="1796.889" dur="4.321">spending money on doing that because I</text>
  <text start="1799.139" dur="4.53">want to spend money you spend some money</text>
  <text start="1801.21" dur="4.5">on something occurring and and we know</text>
  <text start="1803.669" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;ll help you again they&amp;#39;re testing</text>
  <text start="1805.71" dur="3.39">it now when you go to a doctor they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1807.389" dur="3.12">gonna test you they&amp;#39;re gonna do the best</text>
  <text start="1809.1" dur="4.77">they can do whether they were however</text>
  <text start="1810.509" dur="5.581">they&amp;#39;re going to test you but they can</text>
  <text start="1813.87" dur="5.1">do a provocation and do a urine test and</text>
  <text start="1816.09" dur="7.11">say okay you got so much out that&amp;#39;s cool</text>
  <text start="1818.97" dur="6.51">I&amp;#39;m just saying you know if you</text>
  <text start="1823.2" dur="3.599">we know you get some mercury amalgams we</text>
  <text start="1825.48" dur="4.14">know you&amp;#39;ve probably got some mercury in</text>
  <text start="1826.799" dur="4.531">your brain so how long does it typically</text>
  <text start="1829.62" dur="3.48">take for someone who would have like a</text>
  <text start="1831.33" dur="4.829">heavy exposure you know they have a</text>
  <text start="1833.1" dur="5.4">heavy burden to do this to get to a</text>
  <text start="1836.159" dur="5.041">baseline that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="1838.5" dur="4.83">question and you know every every person</text>
  <text start="1841.2" dur="4.53">is different you know the the standard</text>
  <text start="1843.33" dur="5.189">course of IV therapy is where I really</text>
  <text start="1845.73" dur="5.13">draw my baseline from and that you know</text>
  <text start="1848.519" dur="6.331">the standard course of IV is is 30</text>
  <text start="1850.86" dur="6.659">treatments over you know a three month</text>
  <text start="1854.85" dur="5.37">period so I&amp;#39;m sorry over about a six</text>
  <text start="1857.519" dur="5.221">month period so you know if you did two</text>
  <text start="1860.22" dur="5.49">treatments a week or just one treatment</text>
  <text start="1862.74" dur="6.419">a week for you know for one trimming a</text>
  <text start="1865.71" dur="6.449">week and for 30 that&amp;#39;s 30 weeks so</text>
  <text start="1869.159" dur="5.34">you know that is a that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1872.159" dur="5.161">use is to in terms of in terms of the</text>
  <text start="1874.499" dur="5.221">baseline to draw now if you go through</text>
  <text start="1877.32" dur="4.65">one full course and you mean you you</text>
  <text start="1879.72" dur="5.97">test your levels again and you&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="1881.97" dur="5.909">high then then you know then do another</text>
  <text start="1885.69" dur="4.02">ten and test it or it test it again you</text>
  <text start="1887.879" dur="3.36">know you just you want to just you want</text>
  <text start="1889.71" dur="5.25">to do that until your levels are at a</text>
  <text start="1891.239" dur="5.49">point where you&amp;#39;re comfortable but you</text>
  <text start="1894.96" dur="5.069">just got to recognize that when you stop</text>
  <text start="1896.729" dur="7.02">if you stop using any form of chelation</text>
  <text start="1900.029" dur="5.85">what will happen is is is that you now</text>
  <text start="1903.749" dur="4.68">you now start to accumulate again</text>
  <text start="1905.879" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s there will never</text>
  <text start="1908.429" dur="7.891">come a point in time when you stop</text>
  <text start="1912.779" dur="5.46">accumulating unless you&amp;#39;re unless you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1916.32" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re slowing the accumulation or</text>
  <text start="1918.239" dur="5.79">getting ahead of it with with doing some</text>
  <text start="1920.97" dur="4.74">form of chelation now I want to I want</text>
  <text start="1924.029" dur="4.35">to go back a second my dad talked about</text>
  <text start="1925.71" dur="5.969">a provocation test because there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1928.379" dur="5.13">of people have the the I believe that if</text>
  <text start="1931.679" dur="3.72">they just test themselves you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1933.509" dur="3.15">gonna do a test and see what&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="1935.399" dur="5.16">out of my urine or see what&amp;#39;s in my</text>
  <text start="1936.659" dur="5.1">blood yes and no you that may not</text>
  <text start="1940.559" dur="3.99">necessarily be an accurate</text>
  <text start="1941.759" dur="4.86">representation of what you have you need</text>
  <text start="1944.549" dur="5.46">to do what&amp;#39;s called a provoked or a</text>
  <text start="1946.619" dur="5.94">provocation test if you did the cream</text>
  <text start="1950.009" dur="6.181">you know use it you use like two doses</text>
  <text start="1952.559" dur="6.031">of cream and then urinate or or because</text>
  <text start="1956.19" dur="3.929">what you want to do is is heavy metal as</text>
  <text start="1958.59" dur="3.659">they get into the deep tissues of the</text>
  <text start="1960.119" dur="4.831">body and they stay there so you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1962.249" dur="4.56">your blood as much right so what you</text>
  <text start="1964.95" dur="4.14">want to do is you want to put in so you</text>
  <text start="1966.809" dur="4.8">want to put a chelating agent into the</text>
  <text start="1969.09" dur="4.769">body and as it&amp;#39;s passing through the</text>
  <text start="1971.609" dur="4.05">body it will it has it has an</text>
  <text start="1973.859" dur="3.24">electromagnetic charge the EDT has</text>
  <text start="1975.659" dur="3.681">electromagnetic charge what it will do</text>
  <text start="1977.099" dur="5.64">is it&amp;#39;ll reach out and it&amp;#39;ll grab onto</text>
  <text start="1979.34" dur="5.469">it&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;ll spot a heavy metal ion in</text>
  <text start="1982.739" dur="3.54">the body someplace and it will bring it</text>
  <text start="1984.809" dur="3.75">out it&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;ll bring it out from its</text>
  <text start="1986.279" dur="3.661">from its you know surface from it from</text>
  <text start="1988.559" dur="3.36">the surface of where it&amp;#39;s being stored</text>
  <text start="1989.94" dur="5.219">it&amp;#39;ll bring it out into the into the</text>
  <text start="1991.919" dur="5.781">bloodstream and when that happens when</text>
  <text start="1995.159" dur="4.861">that happens you that</text>
  <text start="1997.7" dur="4.96">without that you&amp;#39;re not going to be able</text>
  <text start="2000.02" dur="4.5">to with without you pulling that into</text>
  <text start="2002.66" dur="3.57">the into the body or pulling into the</text>
  <text start="2004.52" dur="3.36">bloodstream you&amp;#39;re not really gonna be</text>
  <text start="2006.23" dur="6.27">able to know if it&amp;#39;s there or not</text>
  <text start="2007.88" dur="6.39">so in terms of it has this effect</text>
  <text start="2012.5" dur="3.69">obviously in the in the body where it</text>
  <text start="2014.27" dur="4.47">grabs and moves how long does that</text>
  <text start="2016.19" dur="4.47">effects they active can you can you go</text>
  <text start="2018.74" dur="3.75">too long and then just move it and drop</text>
  <text start="2020.66" dur="4.38">it off somewhere else and now it&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="2022.49" dur="4.11">damage again do you have to keep on it</text>
  <text start="2025.04" dur="3.06">Dustin that&amp;#39;s why you need to be sure</text>
  <text start="2026.6" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;re drinking a lot of fluids and</text>
  <text start="2028.1" dur="2.22">things to keep things moving that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2029.78" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="2030.32" dur="5.609">yeah and and yeah don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t give up</text>
  <text start="2033.41" dur="5.399">that well the body has a natural desire</text>
  <text start="2035.929" dur="5.581">to get rid of EDTA that it has a natural</text>
  <text start="2038.809" dur="4.261">desire to do that but you know I&amp;#39;m not I</text>
  <text start="2041.51" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t know how much you know about the</text>
  <text start="2043.07" dur="5.87">about chelation but chelation</text>
  <text start="2045.38" dur="6.239">essentially is it&amp;#39;s like a claw</text>
  <text start="2048.94" dur="5.32">basically it&amp;#39;s like the the chelating</text>
  <text start="2051.619" dur="4.471">agent is like a claw and what it does is</text>
  <text start="2054.26" dur="3.389">your your body if you have this molecule</text>
  <text start="2056.09" dur="4.68">right here that your body doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2057.649" dur="7.291">how to get rid of this EDTA or the</text>
  <text start="2060.77" dur="5.909">chelating agent it molecule yeah that is</text>
  <text start="2064.94" dur="4.11">actually that&amp;#39;s the molecule so what</text>
  <text start="2066.679" dur="4.051">happens is it is it&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;ll find that</text>
  <text start="2069.05" dur="4.29">molecule it&amp;#39;ll grab onto it and it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2070.73" dur="4.02">basically encapsulate it now the body</text>
  <text start="2073.34" dur="2.67">doesn&amp;#39;t know how to get rid of the lead</text>
  <text start="2074.75" dur="3.72">but it doesn&amp;#39;t how to get rid of the</text>
  <text start="2076.01" dur="4.23">EDTA it gets her to the EDTA with the</text>
  <text start="2078.47" dur="3.24">encapsulated lead particle in it and it</text>
  <text start="2080.24" dur="3.84">flows right through the body flows right</text>
  <text start="2081.71" dur="3.899">out that&amp;#39;s the whole point of chelation</text>
  <text start="2084.08" dur="3.029">because your body doesn&amp;#39;t know what to</text>
  <text start="2085.609" dur="3.331">do with the lead but it does know what</text>
  <text start="2087.109" dur="6.57">to do with the with the positively</text>
  <text start="2088.94" dur="7.229">charged EDTA molecule so how often of a</text>
  <text start="2093.679" dur="5.611">dose would you recommend for for keeping</text>
  <text start="2096.169" dur="3.541">the blood level having some of this in</text>
  <text start="2099.29" dur="3.56">there</text>
  <text start="2099.71" dur="5.88">I do maintenance maintenance I do daily</text>
  <text start="2102.85" dur="5.41">okay do it every day I do I do it every</text>
  <text start="2105.59" dur="5.88">day I do it a couple of times a day</text>
  <text start="2108.26" dur="5.67">honestly what I recommend people to do</text>
  <text start="2111.47" dur="5.37">is when you are going to set aside the</text>
  <text start="2113.93" dur="5.01">time to do it you know you the the</text>
  <text start="2116.84" dur="4.83">standard dose on the cream is a teaspoon</text>
  <text start="2118.94" dur="4.38">and a half when you take out a teaspoon</text>
  <text start="2121.67" dur="3.48">and a half it&amp;#39;s gonna look like a little</text>
  <text start="2123.32" dur="3.84">bit it&amp;#39;s gonna look like a lot but what</text>
  <text start="2125.15" dur="4.05">you do is you take that out and then you</text>
  <text start="2127.16" dur="3.79">just take a little bit of that rub it in</text>
  <text start="2129.2" dur="3.37">until it goes clear and then</text>
  <text start="2130.95" dur="3.54">taking them take a little bit more and</text>
  <text start="2132.57" dur="3.21">rub that in till it goes clear I don&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="2134.49" dur="2.879">don&amp;#39;t tell people to rub the entire</text>
  <text start="2135.78" dur="4.319">amount in all at once because that</text>
  <text start="2137.369" dur="5.851">that&amp;#39;s almost gets to be it could be</text>
  <text start="2140.099" dur="4.381">it&amp;#39;s to be too much work the rubber for</text>
  <text start="2143.22" dur="3.48">five minutes this stuff is not going</text>
  <text start="2144.48" dur="5.22">clear I do that the first time in my PJs</text>
  <text start="2146.7" dur="5.04">stuck to my legs so so you want to just</text>
  <text start="2149.7" dur="5.01">do a little bit you know start off with</text>
  <text start="2151.74" dur="4.98">a little bit and and just gradually rub</text>
  <text start="2154.71" dur="3.96">it in till it goes clear the smaller</text>
  <text start="2156.72" dur="4.47">amount that you use the the faster it</text>
  <text start="2158.67" dur="5.07">will go clear and you know the faster</text>
  <text start="2161.19" dur="6.48">you can get it in Destin you know what</text>
  <text start="2163.74" dur="5.82">in in this whole business of health in</text>
  <text start="2167.67" dur="5.82">the elf you might say the alternative</text>
  <text start="2169.56" dur="6.57">type thing everybody is looking for the</text>
  <text start="2173.49" dur="6.33">secret you know oh this is the secret</text>
  <text start="2176.13" dur="6.75">well my contention is the secret is</text>
  <text start="2179.82" dur="6.06">there is no secret the secret is it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2182.88" dur="4.5">lot of things and if people are taking</text>
  <text start="2185.88" dur="3.959">responsibility for what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2187.38" dur="5.04">and they&amp;#39;re educating themselves there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2189.839" dur="4.681">a lot of thing places out there that</text>
  <text start="2192.42" dur="4.26">will do that I always tell this story</text>
  <text start="2194.52" dur="3.72">because somebody will say to me well Ron</text>
  <text start="2196.68" dur="4.8">how did you get involved in this what</text>
  <text start="2198.24" dur="5.25">was going on I stir well I realized when</text>
  <text start="2201.48" dur="4.589">I started compounding hormones for men</text>
  <text start="2203.49" dur="4.5">and women and I realized it took me</text>
  <text start="2206.069" dur="4.5">about three months to find out and</text>
  <text start="2207.99" dur="4.56">realize that the doctors did not know</text>
  <text start="2210.569" dur="3.691">how to balance these hormones I would do</text>
  <text start="2212.55" dur="3.75">the hormones for the for the ladies and</text>
  <text start="2214.26" dur="3.39">the guys and they take it for about two</text>
  <text start="2216.3" dur="3.33">or three months and then call me up and</text>
  <text start="2217.65" dur="4.23">say well this isn&amp;#39;t working I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="2219.63" dur="4.26">this or I&amp;#39;m doing that what do I do now</text>
  <text start="2221.88" dur="5.28">and frankly I didn&amp;#39;t know what to tell</text>
  <text start="2223.89" dur="5.82">him I didn&amp;#39;t know but I realized after</text>
  <text start="2227.16" dur="5.61">that very soon I had to know nutrition</text>
  <text start="2229.71" dur="5.639">in order to be able to balance the</text>
  <text start="2232.77" dur="4.98">hormones so over a course of time I</text>
  <text start="2235.349" dur="4.951">became a nutritionist and then I reused</text>
  <text start="2237.75" dur="5.28">to go to a local book store the desert</text>
  <text start="2240.3" dur="5.4">here and I would go in and say okay I</text>
  <text start="2243.03" dur="5.91">need to be knowledgeable so I would go</text>
  <text start="2245.7" dur="5.909">in and buy about ten books take those</text>
  <text start="2248.94" dur="5.33">home read them go back and buy ten more</text>
  <text start="2251.609" dur="6.96">and I&amp;#39;m I did I did that for a long time</text>
  <text start="2254.27" dur="6.79">to try and find out what I could do for</text>

  <text start="2643.94" dur="6.919">you know Dustin you really hit something</text>
  <text start="2646.309" dur="8.371">there because many many many of our</text>
  <text start="2650.859" dur="6.13">natural type of metals if you call it</text>
  <text start="2654.68" dur="4.919">like magnesium a zinc and those kinds of</text>
  <text start="2656.989" dur="5.191">things a copper and iron those are what</text>
  <text start="2659.599" dur="4.95">we call cofactors for enzyme systems in</text>
  <text start="2662.18" dur="3.87">the body and the enzyme systems make</text>
  <text start="2664.549" dur="4.531">make the</text>
  <text start="2666.05" dur="5.22">chemic chemical reaction go but if you</text>
  <text start="2669.08" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t have the enzymes and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2671.27" dur="6.06">have the cofactors if you need magnesium</text>
  <text start="2674.24" dur="5.629">or zinc and you have they led there that</text>
  <text start="2677.33" dur="5.58">doesn&amp;#39;t go very well and so you need</text>
  <text start="2679.869" dur="6.971">those good enzymes the other thing is</text>
  <text start="2682.91" dur="6.03">that the toxic heavy metals can attack</text>
  <text start="2686.84" dur="4.65">the enzyme systems that themselves not</text>
  <text start="2688.94" dur="4.98">just the cofactor but the enzyme systems</text>
  <text start="2691.49" dur="4.83">themselves so you know you could have</text>
  <text start="2693.92" dur="5.04">some brain fog I I can&amp;#39;t tell you how</text>

  <text start="2701.84" dur="5.61">brain fog I&amp;#39;m tired and I have brain fog</text>
  <text start="2704.3" dur="6.42">so whenever we have a lot of toxic heavy</text>
