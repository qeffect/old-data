  <text start="14.219" dur="4.89">warmer now I wanted to talk a little bit</text>
  <text start="16.619" dur="3.931">about something that caught my eye for</text>
  <text start="19.109" dur="3.901">those who were you know in the know</text>
  <text start="20.55" dur="4.08">kim.com is a smart guy and it&amp;#39;s good to</text>
  <text start="23.01" dur="3.89">follow him he usually knows what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="24.63" dur="4.559">talking about sometimes he gets it wrong</text>
  <text start="26.9" dur="4.119">especially you know when it comes to</text>
  <text start="29.189" dur="4.981">some of the nuances of American politics</text>

  <text start="35.76" dur="4.08">that in general so I like the guy a lot</text>
  <text start="37.55" dur="5.259">and of course he&amp;#39;s been a victim of the</text>
  <text start="39.84" dur="5.34">the big state with his website I think</text>
  <text start="42.809" dur="5.191">it was megaupload or whatever they came</text>
  <text start="45.18" dur="6.059">down on him hard for no reason at all</text>
  <text start="48" dur="5.16">now he is saying must read New Zealand</text>

  <text start="72.15" dur="5.06">of their own right now and concerning</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="5.94">corruption now I know that&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="77.21" dur="4.33">reputed to be a hot spot of like some of</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="3.96">the elite like going out to places like</text>
  <text start="81.54" dur="4.46">Australia New Zealand and buying up the</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="5.07">big mansions and kind of taken over</text>

  <text start="96" dur="4.86">know what their their big agenda is but</text>
  <text start="98.42" dur="3.85">these five eyes countries this is</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="3.27">something that a few years ago no one</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="4.52">had ever heard of at least no one</text>
  <text start="104.13" dur="5.37">outside of certain circles right and now</text>
  <text start="106.79" dur="4.27">it&amp;#39;s becoming a household term once</text>
  <text start="109.5" dur="3.27">again we&amp;#39;re moving that Overton Window</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="4.769">like I like to talk about it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="112.77" dur="5.19">like a I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s sort of like a</text>
  <text start="115.829" dur="4.411">lighthouse or a flashlight you have to</text>
  <text start="117.96" dur="4.83">sort of slowly turn it though and then</text>
  <text start="120.24" dur="4.589">you get to the truth of a topic and you</text>
  <text start="122.79" dur="3.179">can start to discuss that topic and</text>
  <text start="124.829" dur="2.461">you&amp;#39;re not too far out of the mainstream</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="3.991">at that point you know</text>
  <text start="127.29" dur="4.8">it becomes more difficult to just smear</text>
  <text start="129.96" dur="4.92">you and get away with it that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="132.09" dur="5.22">Overton Window does for folks now he is</text>
  <text start="134.88" dur="3.9">discussing this because of course like I</text>
  <text start="137.31" dur="3.57">said New Zealand was one of the five</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.35">eyes there involved in this country&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="140.88" dur="3.96">you know spying on each other and</text>
  <text start="143.13" dur="3.78">trading data back and forth and creating</text>
  <text start="144.84" dur="6.03">this big in SA spy grid</text>
  <text start="146.91" dur="6.51">it really is global it really is bad and</text>
  <text start="150.87" dur="4.92">really is worldwide it really is deep</text>
  <text start="153.42" dur="5.61">deep level of corruption and the power</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="5.85">that this concentrates is amazing it is</text>
  <text start="159.03" dur="3.99">too much power for any anyone to be able</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="2.94">to wield or any people to be able to</text>
  <text start="163.02" dur="4.32">wield even as a group whatever I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="164.58" dur="4.65">care it&amp;#39;s too much power at the end of</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="4.59">the day though I wanted to bring this up</text>
  <text start="169.23" dur="4.38">because not only is this now you know</text>
  <text start="171.93" dur="3.59">starting to come out because of all of</text>
  <text start="173.61" dur="5.49">the corruption investigations and such</text>
  <text start="175.52" dur="6.85">and the article is called they spy with</text>
  <text start="179.1" dur="4.68">their little eye consortium news.com but</text>
  <text start="182.37" dur="3.06">I also wanted to bring you to the first</text>
  <text start="183.78" dur="5.07">time Hugh mentioned it back in March</text>
  <text start="185.43" dur="5.07">10th of 2018 he says five eyes is very</text>
  <text start="188.85" dur="3.66">important in response to in an on</text>
  <text start="190.5" dur="3.72">talking about the Australia is part of</text>
  <text start="192.51" dur="3.87">five eyes now it had already been in the</text>
  <text start="194.22" dur="4.019">discussion I think at this point but you</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="4.829">know Hugh brought it up officially and</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s now on the posts way before the MSM</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="5.81">or the mainstream gets ahold of it that</text>
  <text start="204.239" dur="5.31">is a perfect example of what Q is for us</text>
  <text start="207.019" dur="4.331">oftentimes it&amp;#39;s just a peek behind the</text>
  <text start="209.549" dur="3.241">curtain a little bit through the keyhole</text>
  <text start="211.35" dur="4.35">you can kind of see a little bit of</text>
  <text start="212.79" dur="4.35">what&amp;#39;s coming and it just it&amp;#39;s fun you</text>
  <text start="215.7" dur="3.509">know it really is interesting because it</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="4.17">keeps you on your toes in it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.209" dur="5.521">like a big Sudoku game it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="221.31" dur="5.67">complex puzzle and it makes you sharp so</text>
  <text start="224.73" dur="4.229">I always welcome everyone to to join us</text>
  <text start="226.98" dur="3.75">on the whole Q train but you know you</text>
  <text start="228.959" dur="4.081">don&amp;#39;t have to is find to be just Nagas</text>
  <text start="230.73" dur="4.17">and in pro Trump and pro happiness and</text>
  <text start="233.04" dur="4.02">pro freedom and pro life and all of</text>
  <text start="234.9" dur="3.39">these things it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if people</text>
  <text start="237.06" dur="2.399">believe in you or not to me I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="3.6">really particularly care at this point</text>
  <text start="239.459" dur="5.791">anymore I don&amp;#39;t think it matters because</text>
  <text start="241.89" dur="6.96">Q it at this point is more a source of</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="5.88">information like like a search engine or</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="3.6">something rather than you know a person</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="3.18">that they can just smear or something</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="3.49">and that the information seems to be</text>
  <text start="254.31" dur="3.459">generally pretty good</text>
  <text start="255.94" dur="4.53">pretty high odds of predicting the</text>
  <text start="257.769" dur="4.231">future as well and also obviously the</text>
  <text start="260.47" dur="3.27">collusion with Trump where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="262" dur="4.29">playing these back-and-forth games on</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="5.64">Twitter and then you know tippy-top and</text>
  <text start="266.29" dur="4.71">things like that so you know many people</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="3.69">aren&amp;#39;t even yet aware that these things</text>
  <text start="271" dur="4.29">are going on can you believe it I was on</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="4.11">an interview recently and they had not</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="3.42">even heard other than like one or two</text>
  <text start="277.18" dur="3.6">examples where that kind of back and</text>
  <text start="278.71" dur="4.29">forth on Twitter happened and it happens</text>
  <text start="280.78" dur="3.63">weekly usually I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it seems</text>
  <text start="283" dur="4.29">to be at least weekly I mean it is it</text>
  <text start="284.41" dur="4.35">monthly at the very least so we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="287.29" dur="2.76">over a hundred different examples of</text>
  <text start="288.76" dur="3.99">things like this where it&amp;#39;s just too</text>
  <text start="290.05" dur="4.29">much to believe is a coincidence it is</text>
  <text start="292.75" dur="4.98">it strains credulity it is</text>
  <text start="294.34" dur="5.91">mathematically impossible and Q often</text>
  <text start="297.73" dur="4.17">points out how much and I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="3.99">how he phrases it but how much</text>
  <text start="301.9" dur="4.829">coincidence is too much how many</text>
  <text start="304.24" dur="4.38">coincidences is it before you start to</text>
  <text start="306.729" dur="3.361">realize what&amp;#39;s really going on here if</text>
  <text start="308.62" dur="2.91">you&amp;#39;re paying attention and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="310.09" dur="4.049">doing it with an open mind and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.53" dur="5.4">not scoffing and and insulting and</text>
  <text start="314.139" dur="4.291">smearing or deceiving about I like some</text>
  <text start="316.93" dur="3.18">of the fake not gonna do so I just</text>
  <text start="318.43" dur="4.86">wanted to put this video out there and</text>
  <text start="320.11" dur="4.77">let folks know five eyes is almost fair</text>
  <text start="323.29" dur="4.77">game now we&amp;#39;re starting to get to that</text>
  <text start="324.88" dur="4.98">point and this is going to lead back to</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="5.49">the heart of the Deep States corruption</text>
  <text start="329.86" dur="4.95">and spy grid I think and combined with</text>
  <text start="333.55" dur="2.94">the other things Trump is doing right</text>
  <text start="334.81" dur="3.06">now potentially he&amp;#39;s about to wipe out a</text>
  <text start="336.49" dur="3.81">big chunk of the federal government and</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="4.56">employment roster and save us all a lot</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="3.6">of money and being groped by the TSA and</text>
  <text start="342.43" dur="3.18">things like that</text>
  <text start="343.9" dur="5.16">as someone who&amp;#39;s about to travel Thank</text>
  <text start="345.61" dur="4.74">You Trump these were just many many</text>
  <text start="349.06" dur="3.06">things that he&amp;#39;s doing in if he if he</text>
  <text start="350.35" dur="3.27">pulls it all off in cohesion we will</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="4.919">have it rolled unlike you can imagine</text>
  <text start="353.62" dur="5.88">within 20 years now everyone I hope</text>
  <text start="357.039" dur="4.891">everything stays well in your world stay</text>
  <text start="359.5" dur="4.14">tuned more coming of course I I should</text>
  <text start="361.93" dur="4.049">point out I&amp;#39;m launching something called</text>
  <text start="363.64" dur="3.75">because you know the the D monetization</text>
  <text start="365.979" dur="4.351">the censorship and all of that it is</text>
  <text start="367.39" dur="4.649">just so annoying at this point so I</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="3.03">talked to my wife a little bit about it</text>
  <text start="372.039" dur="4.201">and we decided to launch something</text>
  <text start="373.36" dur="4.26">called Club Nemo&amp;#39;s and you may see it</text>
  <text start="376.24" dur="2.76">spelled with a Q or something cuz I like</text>
  <text start="377.62" dur="3.48">to have fun with things but either way</text>
  <text start="379" dur="5.13">you can read about it on my website at</text>
  <text start="381.1" dur="3.85">the top bar there 417 a month you get a</text>
  <text start="384.13" dur="2.68">whole host</text>
  <text start="384.95" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s many of which pay for themselves</text>
  <text start="386.81" dur="4.29">in the first month so it&amp;#39;s definitely I</text>
  <text start="389.39" dur="4.17">think worth it I hope to always try to</text>
  <text start="391.1" dur="4.83">solve problems with a win-win capitalist</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="5.19">Outlook rather than you know ask for</text>
  <text start="395.93" dur="5.46">handouts or anything like that and to</text>
  <text start="398.75" dur="3.9">that extent I think that&amp;#39;s it for the</text>
