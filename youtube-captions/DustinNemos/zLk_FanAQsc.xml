  <text start="105.659" dur="7.861">their support for us so there&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="110.28" dur="6.42">common theory that says former President</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="5.16">Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama was a</text>
  <text start="116.7" dur="4.23">Manchurian Candidate now while he does</text>
  <text start="118.68" dur="4.95">fit the bill for being a Manchurian</text>
  <text start="120.93" dur="4.829">Candidate I really believe that Bernie</text>
  <text start="123.63" dur="4.199">Sanders might actually be a mentoring</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="4.59">candidate right now and has been for a</text>
  <text start="127.829" dur="4.291">while I&amp;#39;m going to explain why I think</text>
  <text start="130.349" dur="2.141">that is and then you can tell me what</text>
  <text start="132.12" dur="2.5">you</text>
  <text start="132.49" dur="4.41">in a little bit but first I want to give</text>
  <text start="134.62" dur="4.92">some updates on some other important</text>
  <text start="136.9" dur="4.65">news pieces for the day okay so the</text>
  <text start="139.54" dur="4.11">first update I want to give is on the</text>
  <text start="141.55" dur="5.01">multi-state human trafficking</text>
  <text start="143.65" dur="5.34">investigation that is ongoing now this</text>
  <text start="146.56" dur="5.12">article that I&amp;#39;m showing right now this</text>
  <text start="148.99" dur="6.03">one here is actually sort of old however</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="5.47">it flew under the radar and I believe</text>
  <text start="155.02" dur="4.8">that this one is rather relevant because</text>
  <text start="157.15" dur="5.55">it has information in this article that</text>
  <text start="159.82" dur="5.97">really wasn&amp;#39;t revealed in any of the</text>
  <text start="162.7" dur="9.75">mainstream articles that I found on this</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="10.71">case so this case is really huge and I</text>
  <text start="172.45" dur="6.66">believe it&amp;#39;s probably at some point</text>
  <text start="176.5" dur="3.75">going to be shut down because at some</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="4.14">point they&amp;#39;re gonna find that this is</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="8.81">connected to very prominent individuals</text>
  <text start="183.25" dur="8.73">right now it&amp;#39;s circling the news as a</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="7.45">multi-state human trafficking operation</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="7.38">and it&amp;#39;s classified as a major human</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="4.5">trafficking operation because the person</text>
  <text start="199.36" dur="5.01">who they claim is at the head of it</text>
  <text start="201.01" dur="5.82">right now David Williams he&amp;#39;s a rather</text>
  <text start="204.37" dur="4.53">obscure person I have never heard of him</text>
  <text start="206.83" dur="5.25">before in my entire life ever and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="208.9" dur="4.92">sure most of you haven&amp;#39;t either unless</text>
  <text start="212.08" dur="6.02">you know this man personally you</text>
  <text start="213.82" dur="8.85">probably have never heard of him so this</text>
  <text start="218.1" dur="8.05">man is based in Florida in Florida is a</text>
  <text start="222.67" dur="6.54">major hub for human trafficking Robert</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="6.06">Kraft had made headlines when he was</text>
  <text start="229.21" dur="5.21">involved in a human trafficking sting</text>
  <text start="232.21" dur="4.26">back in the beginning of this year</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="4.39">initially they had said that it was an</text>
  <text start="236.47" dur="4.29">international human trafficking</text>
  <text start="238.81" dur="5.13">operation which is exactly what it was</text>
  <text start="240.76" dur="5.52">however at that time the only reason why</text>
  <text start="243.94" dur="4.44">they were talking about it in that way</text>
  <text start="246.28" dur="4.44">was because they were hoping that</text>
  <text start="248.38" dur="4.2">somehow they were going to be able to</text>
  <text start="250.72" dur="5.1">bring Donald Trump into it because</text>
  <text start="252.58" dur="5.79">Robert Kraft was loosely associated with</text>
  <text start="255.82" dur="5.13">Donald Trump so of course they will try</text>
  <text start="258.37" dur="4.799">anything they will do anything to try to</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="4.44">take Donald Trump down even if that</text>
  <text start="263.169" dur="3.231">means they cut off their own nose to</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="2.809">spite their face</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="5.01">this is what they do they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="268.199" dur="5.97">predictable as soon as that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="271.41" dur="6.21">happen what happened that investigation</text>
  <text start="274.169" dur="5.671">got watered down to the point where it</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="3.99">was classified as a prostitution sting</text>
  <text start="279.84" dur="3.96">even though in the very beginning they</text>
  <text start="281.61" dur="4.92">indicated all the pieces of evidence</text>
  <text start="283.8" dur="7.11">that strongly demonstrate it was a</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="6.449">trafficking operation but then all of</text>
  <text start="290.91" dur="5.069">that evidence went away and then they</text>
  <text start="292.979" dur="6.331">were able to make sure that the videos</text>
  <text start="295.979" dur="7.5">weren&amp;#39;t able to be viewed in the case by</text>
  <text start="299.31" dur="6.51">the jury right and that is because</text>
  <text start="303.479" dur="3.781">Robert Kraft in his own right is a very</text>
  <text start="305.82" dur="3.81">powerful individual and then there were</text>
  <text start="307.26" dur="5.189">other powerful individuals who were</text>
  <text start="309.63" dur="4.159">involved in that sting but we don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="312.449" dur="5.401">anything about it anymore</text>
  <text start="313.789" dur="7.271">at all it just went away like these</text>
  <text start="317.85" dur="6.569">types of cases always do now this one</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="6.3">has been in the news for a significant</text>
  <text start="324.419" dur="4.411">amount of time and I&amp;#39;ve been following</text>
  <text start="327.36" dur="5.16">it for a little while now so this has</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="7.37">been ongoing for a few months in this</text>
  <text start="332.52" dur="8.7">article that came out apparently when</text>
  <text start="336.2" dur="8.469">this first was initiated when this</text>
  <text start="341.22" dur="6.509">investigation was started this here is</text>
  <text start="344.669" dur="5.701">saying it says some pretty curious</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="7.071">things number one actually is that what</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="8.79">initiated this was report that some of</text>
  <text start="354.8" dur="7.619">the girls who were giving these massages</text>
  <text start="359.16" dur="6.509">that were actually sexual acts for money</text>
  <text start="362.419" dur="6.701">they were minors they were underage</text>
  <text start="365.669" dur="7.31">girls that&amp;#39;s what started this so number</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="7.049">one they&amp;#39;re underage number two</text>
  <text start="372.979" dur="5.321">multi-state so there were four states at</text>
  <text start="376.169" dur="3.841">least involved in this now I think that</text>
  <text start="378.3" dur="5.64">they&amp;#39;re going to find that there are</text>
  <text start="380.01" dur="6.93">other states connected as well but I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="383.94" dur="5.31">get into that in a minute now the other</text>
  <text start="386.94" dur="4.44">thing that was interesting about this is</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="7.59">because the documents related to this</text>
  <text start="391.38" dur="7.49">case are sealed they&amp;#39;re sealed so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="396.84" dur="4.4">interesting</text>
  <text start="398.87" dur="10.53">now the other thing that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="12.209">about this case is that apparently the</text>
  <text start="409.4" dur="6.69">women and girls who are part of this</text>
  <text start="413.449" dur="5.041">human trafficking operation who are</text>
  <text start="416.09" dur="5.63">victims they&amp;#39;re being trafficked they</text>
  <text start="418.49" dur="6.63">are being trafficked largely through</text>
  <text start="421.72" dur="4.87">Flushing New York and I know anyone who</text>
  <text start="425.12" dur="4.41">is listening to this channel and listen</text>
  <text start="426.59" dur="6.96">to me they know you guys know that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="429.53" dur="6.359">mentioned Flushing New York so much this</text>
  <text start="433.55" dur="6.66">is a major hub for human trafficking</text>
  <text start="435.889" dur="6.84">especially when it comes to human</text>
  <text start="440.21" dur="6.12">trafficking victims who are coming from</text>
  <text start="442.729" dur="10.261">the Golden Triangle and surrounding</text>
  <text start="446.33" dur="10.35">areas so in this case one of the reasons</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="6.84">why they&amp;#39;re not releasing david williams</text>
  <text start="456.68" dur="4.95">prior to trial because the preliminary</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="4.559">hearing hasn&amp;#39;t started yet that starts</text>
  <text start="461.63" dur="5.4">November 12th I believe and then the</text>
  <text start="464.389" dur="5.851">actual jury trial begins on December 2nd</text>
  <text start="467.03" dur="5.85">now they&amp;#39;re holding him because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="4.32">saying he has demonstrated that he has</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="5.55">the ability to flee he&amp;#39;s a flight risk</text>
  <text start="474.56" dur="7.14">and one of the things they talk about is</text>
  <text start="478.43" dur="9.75">how he has made several flights to China</text>
  <text start="481.7" dur="10.11">to Vietnam these are areas where women</text>
  <text start="488.18" dur="11.84">and girls have been trafficked from</text>
  <text start="491.81" dur="10.71">for decades and when you talk about</text>
  <text start="500.02" dur="4.119">China and the Golden Triangle and some</text>
  <text start="502.52" dur="5.34">people would say oh the Golden Triangle</text>
  <text start="504.139" dur="6.631">is not China okay technically it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="507.86" dur="6.179">China but it really is China the Golden</text>
  <text start="510.77" dur="8.73">Triangle is a de facto territory of</text>
  <text start="514.039" dur="7.56">China where China owns that area really</text>
  <text start="519.5" dur="3.93">they do most of the people who do</text>
  <text start="521.599" dur="5.431">business there who own businesses are</text>
  <text start="523.43" dur="6.83">Chinese nationals also they deal in</text>
  <text start="527.03" dur="3.23">Chinese currency</text>
  <text start="530.699" dur="9.94">and Vietnam is right there in the Golden</text>
  <text start="536.32" dur="6.629">Triangle so this man apparently has</text>
  <text start="540.639" dur="6.991">flown back and forth to this area</text>
  <text start="542.949" dur="10.26">he has massage parlors all across the</text>
  <text start="547.63" dur="10.579">East Coast multi states and apparently</text>
  <text start="553.209" dur="11.521">he has paid for the tickets of several</text>
  <text start="558.209" dur="9.791">girls from China to New York okay and</text>
  <text start="564.73" dur="8.07">then those girls are flown to different</text>
  <text start="568" dur="9.87">locations across the East Coast to the</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="7.589">massage parlors that he owns so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="577.87" dur="5.519">brought from China from Vietnam from</text>
  <text start="580.389" dur="5.281">those areas over here to the United</text>
  <text start="583.389" dur="7.741">States they don&amp;#39;t have any documentation</text>
  <text start="585.67" dur="8.76">they&amp;#39;re here illegally then they come</text>
  <text start="591.13" dur="6.6">through New York once they make it to</text>
  <text start="594.43" dur="6.48">New York then from Flushing New York</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="7.039">that&amp;#39;s where they are distributed from</text>
  <text start="600.91" dur="3.859">to all these different places</text>
  <text start="605.459" dur="5.831">there should be a huge spotlight on</text>
  <text start="608.949" dur="5.341">Flushing New York right now really and</text>
  <text start="611.29" dur="5.76">I&amp;#39;ve talked this is something that has</text>
  <text start="614.29" dur="5.45">been going on for decades and I remember</text>
  <text start="617.05" dur="5.67">I talked about and I even had included</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="5.86">the correspondence it was from WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="622.72" dur="4.799">and it was from the 70s which means it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="625.6" dur="5.609">rather old but it&amp;#39;s relevant because it</text>
  <text start="627.519" dur="6.06">talks about how there was a system that</text>
  <text start="631.209" dur="5.101">was in place where the even the State</text>
  <text start="633.579" dur="7.671">Department was involved where they had</text>
  <text start="636.31" dur="8.94">brought refugees quote-unquote</text>
  <text start="641.25" dur="6.639">Vietnamese refugees to of the United</text>
  <text start="645.25" dur="5.94">States specifically to the United States</text>
  <text start="647.889" dur="5.481">to a contact they had in New York then</text>
  <text start="651.19" dur="5.61">what happens to them</text>
  <text start="653.37" dur="6.04">wow we seem to have a lot of women and</text>
  <text start="656.8" dur="4.32">girls who are trafficked all over the</text>
  <text start="659.41" dur="3.13">country and they seem to be coming from</text>
  <text start="661.12" dur="3.31">Flushing New York</text>
  <text start="662.54" dur="4.62">and that&amp;#39;s what this articles talking</text>
  <text start="664.43" dur="6.02">about so I really hope this gained some</text>
  <text start="667.16" dur="6.78">traction and I hope that at some point</text>
  <text start="670.45" dur="9.28">this case does not go away like every</text>
  <text start="673.94" dur="11.73">other case has I was not surprised when</text>
  <text start="679.73" dur="10.47">the Kraft case fell apart so this case</text>
  <text start="685.67" dur="7.86">is ongoing right now I doubt that mr.</text>
  <text start="690.2" dur="8.52">Williams is at the head of this I doubt</text>
  <text start="693.53" dur="8.52">that he has very powerful connections</text>
  <text start="698.72" dur="8.04">and it&amp;#39;s likely that there are others</text>
  <text start="702.05" dur="8.22">who are even above him but he would be a</text>
  <text start="706.76" dur="6.06">very good person to use to run these</text>
  <text start="710.27" dur="5.91">different parlors because his name is</text>
  <text start="712.82" dur="8.79">obscure nobody knows him so he would be</text>
  <text start="716.18" dur="8.31">perfect for that so I&amp;#39;ll be following</text>
  <text start="721.61" dur="5.3">this case of course as usual and I will</text>
  <text start="724.49" dur="6.12">give you more updates as they come up</text>
  <text start="726.91" dur="7.51">but it looks like they are getting</text>
  <text start="730.61" dur="7.89">closer to realizing that this is an</text>
  <text start="734.42" dur="5.97">international sex trafficking ring that</text>
  <text start="738.5" dur="6.44">originates actually in the Golden</text>
  <text start="740.39" dur="7.38">Triangle and I really want to actually</text>
  <text start="744.94" dur="4.78">do a special on the Golden Triangle at</text>
  <text start="747.77" dur="4.14">some point just focus on the Golden</text>
  <text start="749.72" dur="6.57">Triangle just that because there is a</text>
  <text start="751.91" dur="11.69">lot to be said about that China is the</text>
  <text start="756.29" dur="10.29">real threat not Russia it&amp;#39;s China ok</text>
  <text start="763.6" dur="5.05">another update I want to give this is on</text>
  <text start="766.58" dur="3.96">the David daleiden Sondra Mara case I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="768.65" dur="6.87">been following this very closely as well</text>
  <text start="770.54" dur="7.02">now the odds are really against David</text>
  <text start="775.52" dur="6.39">daleiden in Samara and their associates</text>
  <text start="777.56" dur="6.51">because the judge in this case is hugely</text>
  <text start="781.91" dur="5.34">biased should have recused himself but</text>
  <text start="784.07" dur="6.51">refused to do so he is affiliated with</text>
  <text start="787.25" dur="7.74">Planned Parenthood definitely because he</text>
  <text start="790.58" dur="8.64">himself funded the opening of a clinic</text>
  <text start="794.99" dur="8.78">an abortion clinic in a Family Resource</text>
  <text start="799.22" dur="7.83">Center that he is a board member of</text>
  <text start="803.77" dur="5.8">hugely compromised here this is a</text>
  <text start="807.05" dur="4.61">conflict of interest he should step</text>
  <text start="809.57" dur="5.269">aside but he refused</text>
  <text start="811.66" dur="6.64">he&amp;#39;s also the same judge that oversaw a</text>
  <text start="814.839" dur="8.561">related case against the Leiden back in</text>
  <text start="818.3" dur="8.21">2016 of which of course they lost so the</text>
  <text start="823.4" dur="6.3">plan is that they lose again</text>
  <text start="826.51" dur="4.99">Planned Parenthood is trying to crush</text>
  <text start="829.7" dur="5.07">these individuals and make an example</text>
  <text start="831.5" dur="5.73">out of them so that no one wants to</text>
  <text start="834.77" dur="5.67">oppose them ever again or even try to</text>
  <text start="837.23" dur="6.03">expose them because David daleiden is</text>
  <text start="840.44" dur="5.07">under merit they did a great job of</text>
  <text start="843.26" dur="4.92">exposing them through their human</text>
  <text start="845.51" dur="6.05">capital project it was a series of 15</text>
  <text start="848.18" dur="6.99">videos where they went undercover and</text>
  <text start="851.56" dur="5.98">they were able to gather up several</text>
  <text start="855.17" dur="4.44">pieces of evidence where Planned</text>
  <text start="857.54" dur="3.6">Parenthood and others within the</text>
  <text start="859.61" dur="4.62">abortion industry had really</text>
  <text start="861.14" dur="5.73">incriminating themselves they were out</text>
  <text start="864.23" dur="5.31">in full view unfortunately the general</text>
  <text start="866.87" dur="6.15">public they are not aware of this still</text>
  <text start="869.54" dur="5.34">so we should share this information as</text>
  <text start="873.02" dur="4.74">much as we possibly can especially to</text>
  <text start="874.88" dur="5.52">those people who are not aware we need</text>
  <text start="877.76" dur="6.66">to really bring awareness to this but</text>
  <text start="880.4" dur="7.26">anyway so the judge is biased he</text>
  <text start="884.42" dur="5.01">hand-picked the jury himself this is</text>
  <text start="887.66" dur="4.799">something I&amp;#39;ve never heard of I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="889.43" dur="7.44">think this happens but the judge</text>
  <text start="892.459" dur="7.831">hand-picked the jury then initially</text>
  <text start="896.87" dur="5.01">during the preliminary hearings because</text>
  <text start="900.29" dur="5.81">certain pieces of information were</text>
  <text start="901.88" dur="8.579">coming out during testimony at that time</text>
  <text start="906.1" dur="10">they said okay we cannot allow the</text>
  <text start="910.459" dur="12.121">videos to be viewed in the trial which</text>
  <text start="916.1" dur="9.18">really is a huge disadvantage for David</text>
  <text start="922.58" dur="4.77">daleiden and Sandra Merritt because this</text>
  <text start="925.28" dur="4.65">case in particular</text>
  <text start="927.35" dur="6.12">the case against them the charges are</text>
  <text start="929.93" dur="9.15">that they had committed Reiko that they</text>
  <text start="933.47" dur="7.56">had videotaped confidential private</text>
  <text start="939.08" dur="6.39">conversations it was a violation of</text>
  <text start="941.03" dur="7.65">privacy but the videos if they&amp;#39;re viewed</text>
  <text start="945.47" dur="7.8">the videos show that these conversations</text>
  <text start="948.68" dur="6.42">were not private or confidential some of</text>
  <text start="953.27" dur="3.93">them a lot of them actually were at a</text>
  <text start="955.1" dur="4.11">restaurant where waiters different</text>
  <text start="957.2" dur="5.28">people were walking by and so you can</text>
  <text start="959.21" dur="6.36">see that so while these conversations</text>
  <text start="962.48" dur="4.79">are occurring anyone can hear them so</text>
  <text start="965.57" dur="4.86">that means it&amp;#39;s not private</text>
  <text start="967.27" dur="6.03">of course then when it came to the</text>
  <text start="970.43" dur="6.02">videos where they were at a conference</text>
  <text start="973.3" dur="7.24">planned parenthood&amp;#39;s argument is that</text>
  <text start="976.45" dur="6.31">it&amp;#39;s private because all of the people</text>
  <text start="980.54" dur="3.03">there were like-minded they were of the</text>
  <text start="982.76" dur="2.97">same mindset</text>
  <text start="983.57" dur="8.64">so therefore the information was</text>
  <text start="985.73" dur="10.29">confidential now recently what happened</text>
  <text start="992.21" dur="6.99">is that the defense attorney was able to</text>
  <text start="996.02" dur="5.43">show they were able to argue that they</text>
  <text start="999.2" dur="5.94">needed to show this video in order to</text>
  <text start="1001.45" dur="8.88">prove that this was not a private</text>
  <text start="1005.14" dur="7.65">conversation and so they were able to</text>
  <text start="1010.33" dur="5.22">show one of the videos and only four</text>
  <text start="1012.79" dur="7.25">minutes of that video this was</text>
  <text start="1015.55" dur="8.899">groundbreaking because in that video</text>
  <text start="1020.04" dur="7.53">Planned Parenthood was talking about</text>
  <text start="1024.449" dur="5.471">what they would do in order to obtain</text>
  <text start="1027.57" dur="5.98">organs the organs that they wanted and</text>
  <text start="1029.92" dur="6.24">how they would change procedures so on</text>
  <text start="1033.55" dur="4.98">the one hand when it came to actually</text>
  <text start="1036.16" dur="4.41">aborting a baby they would they were</text>
  <text start="1038.53" dur="4.409">talking about how they would quote crush</text>
  <text start="1040.57" dur="6.84">above and crush below in order to obtain</text>
  <text start="1042.939" dur="7.321">the thorax and the lungs the heart so</text>
  <text start="1047.41" dur="7.74">those pieces could be intact so they</text>
  <text start="1050.26" dur="7.25">could obviously sell them later because</text>
  <text start="1055.15" dur="3.67">those pieces were in high demand</text>
  <text start="1057.51" dur="4.22">additional</text>
  <text start="1058.82" dur="5.76">when you talk about the head they were</text>
  <text start="1061.73" dur="5.939">talking about how they would change the</text>
  <text start="1064.58" dur="6.39">presentation of the baby now this of</text>
  <text start="1067.669" dur="4.97">course not only is this unethical</text>
  <text start="1070.97" dur="3.78">because of course that means they are</text>
  <text start="1072.639" dur="4.961">harvest they are doing this for the</text>
  <text start="1074.75" dur="4.5">purpose of harvesting the head so they</text>
  <text start="1077.6" dur="4.829">can get the brain and sell that for more</text>
  <text start="1079.25" dur="6.24">profit not only that but also when it</text>
  <text start="1082.429" dur="6.21">comes to the patient right this is</text>
  <text start="1085.49" dur="6.149">dangerous you don&amp;#39;t typically you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1088.639" dur="6.12">going to do breach breach presentation</text>
  <text start="1091.639" dur="5.16">is something that if you are a pregnant</text>
  <text start="1094.759" dur="4.711">woman in your going for prenatal care</text>
  <text start="1096.799" dur="7.74">there always check to see how the baby</text>
  <text start="1099.47" dur="9.9">is presented because if the baby is born</text>
  <text start="1104.539" dur="8.701">feet-first that can damage that can</text>
  <text start="1109.37" dur="6.889">damage the woman to a point where she</text>
  <text start="1113.24" dur="8.13">may not be able to carry another baby</text>
  <text start="1116.259" dur="8.441">that is a risk so they&amp;#39;re changing this</text>
  <text start="1121.37" dur="9.87">presentation to breach to a presentation</text>
  <text start="1124.7" dur="9.209">that is not really allowed okay they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1131.24" dur="4.769">changing it without the consent of the</text>
  <text start="1133.909" dur="7.441">patient or the knowledge of the patient</text>
  <text start="1136.009" dur="7.41">has no idea this is occurring so they</text>
  <text start="1141.35" dur="4.559">are risking her reproductive help they</text>
  <text start="1143.419" dur="4.651">talked about being all about women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1145.909" dur="4.801">reproductive rights yet they&amp;#39;re risking</text>
  <text start="1148.07" dur="4.68">her permanent reproductive health by</text>
  <text start="1150.71" dur="5.49">doing this so that they can harvest a</text>
  <text start="1152.75" dur="6.179">baby part to make more money so all of</text>
  <text start="1156.2" dur="6.449">this information was heard in a four</text>
  <text start="1158.929" dur="5.671">minute clip by the jury so hopefully</text>
  <text start="1162.649" dur="5.12">this will weigh in their favor and this</text>
  <text start="1164.6" dur="6.48">was really a huge breakthrough because</text>
  <text start="1167.769" dur="7.75">without these videos being able to be</text>
  <text start="1171.08" dur="7.729">viewed they cannot really defend</text>
  <text start="1175.519" dur="6.74">themselves because then it becomes</text>
  <text start="1178.809" dur="7.08">Planned Parenthood&amp;#39;s word against theirs</text>
  <text start="1182.259" dur="6.13">because the evidence is in the videos</text>
  <text start="1185.889" dur="4.24">all right so I&amp;#39;ll be following this case</text>
  <text start="1188.389" dur="4.461">of course as usual and giving you</text>
  <text start="1190.129" dur="2.721">updates on that</text>

  <text start="1344.26" dur="3.02">that this whole thing is fake right</text>
  <text start="1346.33" dur="7.2">there</text>
  <text start="1347.28" dur="8.86">very simple either it&amp;#39;s a sham or they</text>
  <text start="1353.53" dur="4.08">have no idea what they&amp;#39;re doing and they</text>

  <text start="1357.61" dur="4.83">they really have no idea what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1359.14" dur="5.61">doing now when it comes to Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="1362.44" dur="3.54">of course tonight they&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="1364.75" dur="4.28">vote on whether or not they should</text>
  <text start="1365.98" dur="5.25">censor Adam Schiff and of course</text>
  <text start="1369.03" dur="3.58">President Trump also tweeted about this</text>
  <text start="1371.23" dur="3.42">and he said at the very least they</text>
  <text start="1372.61" dur="4.049">should censor him and I think that is</text>
  <text start="1374.65" dur="3.6">the very least they should do in fact</text>
  <text start="1376.659" dur="3.39">they shouldn&amp;#39;t just do that they need to</text>
  <text start="1378.25" dur="4.74">get him out of office he doesn&amp;#39;t belong</text>
  <text start="1380.049" dur="6.63">there he has gotten in front of Congress</text>
  <text start="1382.99" dur="10.59">in front of the American people and told</text>
  <text start="1386.679" dur="10.441">lies about a crime that&amp;#39;s a crime</text>
  <text start="1393.58" dur="7.62">he cannot be a criminal and still be in</text>
  <text start="1397.12" dur="6.33">office you can&amp;#39;t do that if he is going</text>
  <text start="1401.2" dur="4.95">to break the law he cannot be a lawmaker</text>
  <text start="1403.45" dur="7.14">so at the very least he should be</text>
  <text start="1406.15" dur="7.71">censored that is the least of what they</text>
  <text start="1410.59" dur="5.99">should do but really they need to remove</text>
  <text start="1413.86" dur="7.98">him he needs to be removed right now</text>
  <text start="1416.58" dur="6.4">because he&amp;#39;s a proven liar this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1421.84" dur="4.38">the first time he&amp;#39;s done this</text>
  <text start="1422.98" dur="5.79">he said initially that he had absolute</text>
  <text start="1426.22" dur="4.53">concrete evidence that President Trump</text>
  <text start="1428.77" dur="4.98">was colluding with Russia where was it</text>
  <text start="1430.75" dur="7.46">it was nowhere and now he got up in</text>
  <text start="1433.75" dur="7.409">front of the Congress and the people and</text>
  <text start="1438.21" dur="4.54">told lies about what President Trump had</text>
  <text start="1441.159" dur="3.27">said in order to make it look like</text>
  <text start="1442.75" dur="3.78">President Rama had committed a crime</text>
  <text start="1444.429" dur="3.571">which wasn&amp;#39;t true and then he tried to</text>
  <text start="1446.53" dur="7.29">laugh it off and say it was a parody</text>
  <text start="1448" dur="7.02">because he was caught No you joke about</text>
  <text start="1453.82" dur="3.989">that</text>
  <text start="1455.02" dur="5.64">that is not okay we&amp;#39;re talking about a</text>
  <text start="1457.809" dur="5.521">serious allegation here you don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="1460.66" dur="4.47">jokes about that so you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1463.33" dur="4.41">escape this just because you were caught</text>
  <text start="1465.13" dur="5.15">in a lie you can&amp;#39;t just dodge around it</text>
  <text start="1467.74" dur="5.1">and say oh I was just making fun</text>
  <text start="1470.28" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re a lawmaker you don&amp;#39;t make fun</text>
  <text start="1472.84" dur="5.57">though not when it comes to this</text>
  <text start="1474.33" dur="4.08">definitely not when it comes to this and</text>
  <text start="1478.65" dur="7.84">of course Adam Schiff is in even more</text>
  <text start="1483.13" dur="7.31">trouble because apparently he was</text>
  <text start="1486.49" dur="7.98">actually colluding with Ukraine as well</text>
  <text start="1490.44" dur="5.71">so let&amp;#39;s take a listen to this US</text>
  <text start="1494.47" dur="3.209">intelligence chairman Adam Schiff is</text>
  <text start="1496.15" dur="3.51">pushing back against calls for his</text>

  <text start="1786.5" dur="4.17">makes sense because what really is the</text>

  <text start="1802.37" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re still the same person right so</text>
  <text start="1805.61" dur="4.83">they shouldn&amp;#39;t need a separate license</text>

  <text start="1830.96" dur="6.21">be following this to see what happens</text>
  <text start="1832.49" dur="6.84">with it okay in other odd news and of</text>
  <text start="1837.17" dur="4.55">course we&amp;#39;re following these Democrat</text>

  <text start="1859.58" dur="5.26">policies such as gun confiscation but of</text>

  <text start="1886.17" dur="5.37">president which he won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1887.04" dur="7.56">and then once off the stage he was</text>
  <text start="1891.54" dur="4.44">questioned by someone who wanted to know</text>
  <text start="1894.6" dur="4.01">if he was really going to do that and he</text>
  <text start="1895.98" dur="5.28">said no we&amp;#39;re not going to confiscate</text>

  <text start="1901.26" dur="6.69">we expect from a politician they say</text>

  <text start="2146.989" dur="5.01">President Trump from thirty years ago</text>
  <text start="2149.329" dur="5.881">he&amp;#39;s saying the same exact things then</text>
  <text start="2151.999" dur="7.981">that he&amp;#39;s saying now hasn&amp;#39;t skipped a</text>
  <text start="2155.21" dur="7.559">beat except on a few things and I think</text>
  <text start="2159.98" dur="6.66">that comes with knowledge gaining new</text>
  <text start="2162.769" dur="6">information so for example the issue on</text>
  <text start="2166.64" dur="4.949">abortion so some people want to say he</text>
  <text start="2168.769" dur="5.701">flip-flopped on that issue where he was</text>
  <text start="2171.589" dur="5.851">pro-choice and now he&amp;#39;s pro-life well</text>
  <text start="2174.47" dur="4.559">that comes with information gaining new</text>
  <text start="2177.44" dur="2.94">information when you are presented with</text>
  <text start="2179.029" dur="3.33">new information then you take that</text>
  <text start="2180.38" dur="6.54">information and say you know what now I</text>
  <text start="2182.359" dur="8.72">changed my mind because of this so with</text>
  <text start="2186.92" dur="8.069">that the Center for medical progress</text>
  <text start="2191.079" dur="7.51">when they produce their human capital</text>
  <text start="2194.989" dur="7.01">project the series of 15 videos they had</text>
  <text start="2198.589" dur="3.41">actually made that</text>
  <text start="2202.009" dur="9.69">noticeable to Congress and to the</text>
  <text start="2204.749" dur="14.52">president that was back in 2015-2016</text>
  <text start="2211.699" dur="10.51">actually so let&amp;#39;s say I&amp;#39;m a person who</text>
  <text start="2219.269" dur="6.21">doesn&amp;#39;t understand what the abortion</text>
  <text start="2222.209" dur="5.49">industry is and then all of a sudden I</text>
  <text start="2225.479" dur="3.69">gain this new information that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2227.699" dur="2.701">an evil organization that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2229.169" dur="5.55">this that they&amp;#39;re not really about</text>
  <text start="2230.4" dur="7.669">reproductive rights that pro-choice is</text>
  <text start="2234.719" dur="8.4">not really about reproductive rights</text>
  <text start="2238.069" dur="6.73">it&amp;#39;s about profit if that came to my</text>
  <text start="2243.119" dur="3.66">attention I would definitely then change</text>
  <text start="2244.799" dur="5.4">my mind because I&amp;#39;m telling you years</text>
  <text start="2246.779" dur="5.851">ago several years ago I was also</text>
  <text start="2250.199" dur="5.07">pro-choice I would never in a million</text>
  <text start="2252.63" dur="4.739">years get an abortion myself but I</text>
  <text start="2255.269" dur="3.96">thought you know maybe there are some</text>
  <text start="2257.369" dur="3.72">cases where people you know they just</text>
  <text start="2259.229" dur="3.18">have to have an abortion</text>
  <text start="2261.089" dur="2.76">maybe the woman&amp;#39;s life is in danger</text>
  <text start="2262.409" dur="3.75">maybe and I thought of all these</text>
  <text start="2263.849" dur="4.47">different things because this is the</text>
  <text start="2266.159" dur="5.34">propaganda they were pushing but then</text>
  <text start="2268.319" dur="5.94">the more research I did the more</text>
  <text start="2271.499" dur="4.04">information I learned about then I</text>
  <text start="2274.259" dur="9.51">changed my mind</text>
  <text start="2275.539" dur="10.66">now I&amp;#39;m solidly pro-life I am definitely</text>
  <text start="2283.769" dur="5.22">against the abortion industry because of</text>
  <text start="2286.199" dur="5.37">the information so in that regard</text>
  <text start="2288.989" dur="4.23">someone like President Trump most of his</text>
  <text start="2291.569" dur="4.17">principles have been solid but then</text>
  <text start="2293.219" dur="5.22">there are few I think have been changed</text>
  <text start="2295.739" dur="7.58">due to new information coming tulsi</text>
  <text start="2298.439" dur="9.93">gabbard a flip-flopper historically a</text>

  <text start="2327.599" dur="6.921">her with this guy Evan Duke and she</text>
  <text start="2331.469" dur="5.331">actually had really talked very high</text>
  <text start="2334.52" dur="8.22">the of him well who is this person he is</text>
  <text start="2336.8" dur="10.11">the guy who is he&amp;#39;s an tyfa member who</text>

  <text start="2372.74" dur="13.53">Tulsi Gabbard this picture alone speaks</text>
  <text start="2377.36" dur="11.82">volumes Tulsi Gabbard is not someone who</text>
  <text start="2386.27" dur="8.13">we should support because the purpose of</text>
  <text start="2389.18" dur="7.89">her likely would be to pull those voters</text>
  <text start="2394.4" dur="6.209">who are on the fence away from President</text>

  <text start="2408.59" dur="7.56">do is pull boats away from President</text>
  <text start="2410.63" dur="8.15">Trump it&amp;#39;s a tactic it&amp;#39;s a tactic but</text>
  <text start="2416.15" dur="6.65">we&amp;#39;re too smart for that</text>
  <text start="2418.78" dur="8.8">okay next up I really want to talk about</text>
  <text start="2422.8" dur="6.88">the move toward socialism so this blog</text>
  <text start="2427.58" dur="4.05">was sent to me thank you Scott again</text>
  <text start="2429.68" dur="5.25">Scott always sends the best stuff he</text>
  <text start="2431.63" dur="6.15">really does so the extinction rebellion</text>
  <text start="2434.93" dur="7.64">I had started talking about that and had</text>
  <text start="2437.78" dur="8.79">mentioned how really this whole</text>
  <text start="2442.57" dur="9.01">organized worldwide protest was likely</text>
  <text start="2446.57" dur="8.49">backed by elite globalists as part of</text>
  <text start="2451.58" dur="10.2">the push towards agenda 2030 that is the</text>
  <text start="2455.06" dur="9.84">goal we all focus on our own elections</text>
  <text start="2461.78" dur="6">we focus on you know the midterms from</text>
  <text start="2464.9" dur="3.57">2018 and now we have the upcoming 2020</text>
  <text start="2467.78" dur="2.94">election who</text>
  <text start="2468.47" dur="5.28">you know trying to vote president Trump</text>
  <text start="2470.72" dur="6.06">into op keep him in office but it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="2473.75" dur="6.109">much bigger than that because the thing</text>
  <text start="2476.78" dur="5.88">is and I mention this yesterday we have</text>
  <text start="2479.859" dur="6.941">two separate governments we have of</text>
  <text start="2482.66" dur="6.08">course the up front out in the public</text>
  <text start="2486.8" dur="4.11">view government the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="2488.74" dur="4.06">but then you have this shadow government</text>
  <text start="2490.91" dur="5.61">which has really been in control all</text>
  <text start="2492.8" dur="5.789">along and that shadow government is in</text>
  <text start="2496.52" dur="4.2">league with the globalists the elite</text>
  <text start="2498.589" dur="4.441">globalist right the Rockefellers the</text>
  <text start="2500.72" dur="5.3">Soros those people okay</text>
  <text start="2503.03" dur="5.069">those people who are really behind</text>
  <text start="2506.02" dur="5.47">everything that is happening in the</text>
  <text start="2508.099" dur="9.091">world because they are playing it like</text>
  <text start="2511.49" dur="11.52">moving chess pieces they have had a plan</text>
  <text start="2517.19" dur="8.46">for decades for decades they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2523.01" dur="5.099">trying to push forward because when you</text>
  <text start="2525.65" dur="4.5">have a goal you have to go through these</text>
  <text start="2528.109" dur="4.951">different steps in order to achieve that</text>
  <text start="2530.15" dur="4.77">ultimate goal especially when we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2533.06" dur="5.4">talking about the current goal the</text>
  <text start="2534.92" dur="5.85">current goal is very radical very</text>
  <text start="2538.46" dur="9.389">radical you&amp;#39;re talking a one-world</text>
  <text start="2540.77" dur="9.569">government that is a radical idea to</text>
  <text start="2547.849" dur="5.401">pull it off they will have to be very</text>
  <text start="2550.339" dur="6.411">smart and move very slowly and rather</text>
  <text start="2553.25" dur="7.38">under the radar without us knowing</text>
  <text start="2556.75" dur="4.869">the extinction rebellion seems to it</text>
  <text start="2560.63" dur="3.78">popped up out of nowhere</text>
  <text start="2561.619" dur="3.421">Greta Thornburg seemed to pop up out of</text>
  <text start="2564.41" dur="2.85">nowhere</text>
  <text start="2565.04" dur="4.5">but where&amp;#39;s this young girl coming from</text>
  <text start="2567.26" dur="5.16">now she&amp;#39;s flitting all over the world</text>
  <text start="2569.54" dur="4.77">speaking about climate change climate</text>
  <text start="2572.42" dur="4.23">change it&amp;#39;s not about climate change and</text>
  <text start="2574.31" dur="4.74">even in this blog they had mentioned</text>
  <text start="2576.65" dur="5.73">that the co-founder of this movement had</text>
  <text start="2579.05" dur="7.039">even said in his own article that this</text>
  <text start="2582.38" dur="10.32">was not about climate change it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="2586.089" dur="10.181">changing society destroying the European</text>
  <text start="2592.7" dur="5.129">society as we know it but really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2596.27" dur="3.69">not just about destroying Europeans</text>
  <text start="2597.829" dur="3.49">aside it&amp;#39;s about destroying all of</text>
  <text start="2599.96" dur="3.909">societies you have to break</text>
  <text start="2601.319" dur="6.47">anything down so you can build what you</text>
  <text start="2603.869" dur="9.48">want on top of the crumbled foundation</text>
  <text start="2607.789" dur="11.77">that&amp;#39;s what they want they&amp;#39;re destroying</text>
  <text start="2613.349" dur="11.25">cultures and this whole climate change</text>
  <text start="2619.559" dur="9.361">hysteria movement is really pushing for</text>
  <text start="2624.599" dur="7.62">radical change but what they&amp;#39;re calling</text>
  <text start="2628.92" dur="8.97">for it&amp;#39;s not about the climate it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2632.219" dur="10.32">about handing over control to these</text>
  <text start="2637.89" dur="6.78">elite in the name of sustainable</text>

  <text start="2644.67" dur="5.189">our precious climate which it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2646.589" dur="9.42">about the climate but that&amp;#39;s really just</text>
  <text start="2649.859" dur="10.98">the cover for it so in this blog article</text>
  <text start="2656.009" dur="6.651">they&amp;#39;re talking about how really this is</text>
  <text start="2660.839" dur="6.331">all a setup</text>
  <text start="2662.66" dur="6.159">and how strange it is that for example</text>
  <text start="2667.17" dur="3.569">in this photograph</text>
  <text start="2668.819" dur="5.04">they had mentioned that for these</text>
  <text start="2670.739" dur="4.86">protests the police had contacted the</text>
  <text start="2673.859" dur="5.01">media before they even went to make the</text>
  <text start="2675.599" dur="7.801">arrest so the media was conveniently</text>
  <text start="2678.869" dur="8.58">there to cover this because they want</text>
  <text start="2683.4" dur="6.51">the world to see it because as the</text>
  <text start="2687.449" dur="4.59">saying goes if a tree falls in the</text>
  <text start="2689.91" dur="5.429">rainforest and no one is around to hear</text>
  <text start="2692.039" dur="6.391">it does it really happen same thing with</text>
  <text start="2695.339" dur="5.88">this they want the public to be aware</text>
  <text start="2698.43" dur="4.71">that it&amp;#39;s going on they want to garner</text>
  <text start="2701.219" dur="4.14">that support they want people to be</text>
  <text start="2703.14" dur="4.29">brainwashed into thinking oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="2705.359" dur="3.9">there must really be a crisis going on</text>
  <text start="2707.43" dur="4.23">right now look at all these people</text>
  <text start="2709.259" dur="5.07">protesting all across the world and the</text>
  <text start="2711.66" dur="6.78">police they&amp;#39;re so brutal they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2714.329" dur="6.9">harassing these these protesters that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2718.44" dur="4.589">what they want and then of course in</text>
  <text start="2721.229" dur="5.22">this picture and I find this to be</text>
  <text start="2723.029" dur="5.58">rather interesting again it looks like</text>
  <text start="2726.449" dur="7.271">they&amp;#39;re here there are posing for this</text>
  <text start="2728.609" dur="9.731">picture the police they&amp;#39;re all in on it</text>
  <text start="2733.72" dur="8.01">and that&amp;#39;s why there was actually</text>
  <text start="2738.34" dur="7.92">another demonstration at the end of last</text>
  <text start="2741.73" dur="7.08">week I believe it was somewhere in the</text>
  <text start="2746.26" dur="5.07">UK I can&amp;#39;t remember at this very second</text>
  <text start="2748.81" dur="4.95">if I remember it I&amp;#39;ll let you know where</text>

  <text start="2753.76" dur="5.34">remember you can pop it in the comments</text>
  <text start="2755.77" dur="6.45">below but there was a demonstration</text>
  <text start="2759.1" dur="6.47">where these protesters from the Asia</text>
  <text start="2762.22" dur="6.96">rebellion had shut down an intersection</text>
  <text start="2765.57" dur="8.32">they had built up some structure some</text>

  <text start="2804.22" dur="8.01">working together now also another</text>
  <text start="2809.59" dur="6.3">article that&amp;#39;s not really about climate</text>
  <text start="2812.23" dur="9.12">but it is also a part of this push</text>
  <text start="2815.89" dur="9.09">towards socialism so in this article</text>

  <text start="3187.5" dur="7.19">increasing the wage from two to three</text>
  <text start="3189.45" dur="7.71">bucks an hour to 15 bucks that is a lot</text>
  <text start="3194.69" dur="8.95">that is a big difference and it will</text>
  <text start="3197.16" dur="10.56">cripple that business because that is a</text>
  <text start="3203.64" dur="5.16">huge jump in the budget especially when</text>
  <text start="3207.72" dur="2.61">it comes to labor so what will they have</text>
  <text start="3208.8" dur="3.33">to do they&amp;#39;ll have to cut the labor or</text>
  <text start="3210.33" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ll have to raise their prices and</text>
  <text start="3212.13" dur="4.26">then of course customers are not gonna</text>
  <text start="3213.81" dur="3.68">like that so they&amp;#39;re gonna go somewhere</text>
  <text start="3216.39" dur="5.79">else</text>
  <text start="3217.49" dur="7.39">that&amp;#39;s why currently in cities where</text>

  <text start="3224.88" dur="4.38">these restaurants businesses they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3226.5" dur="7.29">closing so actually they&amp;#39;re talking</text>

  <text start="3233.79" dur="5.16">class it&amp;#39;s not going to do that because</text>
  <text start="3236.22" dur="5.4">all of the mom-and-pop shops they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3238.95" dur="4.359">going to be able to afford this increase</text>

  <text start="3692.69" dur="7.44">Hillary because they stole it from him</text>
  <text start="3694.75" dur="7.119">before his candidacy though I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3700.13" dur="4.01">think I ever really heard people talk</text>
  <text start="3701.869" dur="6.24">about democratic socialism before now</text>
  <text start="3704.14" dur="6.13">Obama apparently was really a Democratic</text>
  <text start="3708.109" dur="5.461">Socialist he was pushing us toward</text>
  <text start="3710.27" dur="5.75">socialism but he wasn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="3713.57" dur="5.43">forthcoming about that why because</text>
  <text start="3716.02" dur="5.349">historically socialism communism we know</text>
  <text start="3719" dur="4.71">these are bad they have bad connotations</text>
  <text start="3721.369" dur="4.171">so they can&amp;#39;t just say oh yeah we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3723.71" dur="3.78">gonna move toward socialism now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3725.54" dur="6.9">supporting socialism no no no no</text>
  <text start="3727.49" dur="8.04">although socialism communism this really</text>
  <text start="3732.44" dur="7.11">has to be the system in place for one</text>
  <text start="3735.53" dur="6.24">world government to work right all</text>
  <text start="3739.55" dur="6.45">across the globe that they have to be in</text>
  <text start="3741.77" dur="11.16">this system but of course they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3746" dur="8.88">just try to force feed us socialism they</text>
  <text start="3752.93" dur="3.79">can&amp;#39;t just all of a sudden say okay</text>
  <text start="3754.88" dur="7.39">socialism is good now</text>
  <text start="3756.72" dur="10.139">they have to trick us so think about</text>
  <text start="3762.27" dur="7.86">this when Bernie Sanders came out during</text>
  <text start="3766.859" dur="6.271">his original run and he garnered so much</text>
  <text start="3770.13" dur="5.459">support so much support on his</text>
  <text start="3773.13" dur="4.56">medicare-for-all and oh yeah a free</text>
  <text start="3775.589" dur="4.891">college all of a sudden people were</text>
  <text start="3777.69" dur="6.179">paying attention like oh yeah free</text>
  <text start="3780.48" dur="8.46">college free health care free stuff oh</text>
  <text start="3783.869" dur="8.311">yeah I&amp;#39;m into that so he built this army</text>
  <text start="3788.94" dur="5.37">of supporters and that&amp;#39;s how really he</text>
  <text start="3792.18" dur="4.47">was supposed to win the primaries he had</text>
  <text start="3794.31" dur="5.7">the popular vote above Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="3796.65" dur="9.179">we forget that but they stole it from</text>
  <text start="3800.01" dur="9.78">him so now here we are 2019 and we just</text>
  <text start="3805.829" dur="6.78">had in Atlanta Georgia a democratic</text>
  <text start="3809.79" dur="6.51">socialist convention these people are</text>
  <text start="3812.609" dur="6.121">serious and virtually every single</text>
  <text start="3816.3" dur="4.44">candidate is talking about Medicare for</text>
  <text start="3818.73" dur="3.48">all they own they don&amp;#39;t want to tell us</text>
  <text start="3820.74" dur="2.7">how we&amp;#39;re gonna pay for that because</text>
  <text start="3822.21" dur="5.25">they know they&amp;#39;re gonna have to increase</text>
  <text start="3823.44" dur="5.58">taxes through the roof but they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="3827.46" dur="4.02">supporting it they&amp;#39;re saying Oh free</text>
  <text start="3829.02" dur="4.049">health care free college for everything</text>
  <text start="3831.48" dur="8.96">they&amp;#39;re supporting all of these</text>
  <text start="3833.069" dur="11.51">socialist ideas so now people are</text>
  <text start="3840.44" dur="10.84">supporting socialism all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="3844.579" dur="11.441">this is the planet so Bernie Sanders</text>
  <text start="3851.28" dur="8.52">rally had 26 or 27 thousand people at</text>
  <text start="3856.02" dur="4.29">that one rally this should not be taken</text>
  <text start="3859.8" dur="3.66">lightly</text>
  <text start="3860.31" dur="5.759">yeah Trump has a lot of people at his</text>
  <text start="3863.46" dur="5.399">rallies President Trump is very popular</text>
  <text start="3866.069" dur="5.01">but we have forgotten that Bernie</text>
  <text start="3868.859" dur="4.171">Sanders is also very popular of course</text>
  <text start="3871.079" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;re really talking about Biden being</text>
  <text start="3873.03" dur="4.02">a front-runner and Warren being a</text>
  <text start="3874.92" dur="7.23">front-runner Biden he&amp;#39;s not gonna win</text>
  <text start="3877.05" dur="7.38">they know it Warren is only legitimate</text>
  <text start="3882.15" dur="4.399">right now because she&amp;#39;s connected to</text>
  <text start="3884.43" dur="4.829">Planned Parenthood</text>
  <text start="3886.549" dur="6.31">but bernie sanders has a legitimate</text>
  <text start="3889.259" dur="6.151">following he&amp;#39;s the one who is really</text>
  <text start="3892.859" dur="7.26">championing this whole democratic</text>
  <text start="3895.41" dur="11.099">socialist system he&amp;#39;s changing the minds</text>
  <text start="3900.119" dur="7.561">of the people he&amp;#39;s programming them we</text>
  <text start="3906.509" dur="6.35">have to be paying attention to this</text>
  <text start="3907.68" dur="7.74">because even if he does not win in 2020</text>
  <text start="3912.859" dur="7.391">pray to God that President Trump wins</text>
  <text start="3915.42" dur="9.08">another term even if he does not win he</text>
  <text start="3920.25" dur="7.799">has now planted the seed for socialism</text>
  <text start="3924.5" dur="7.029">then in 2024 guess who&amp;#39;s gonna be voting</text>
  <text start="3928.049" dur="7.28">the next generation the ones who&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="3931.529" dur="7.101">indoctrinated into this socialist system</text>
  <text start="3935.329" dur="5.861">we have to be paying attention to this</text>
  <text start="3938.63" dur="7.78">because it&amp;#39;s not just about this</text>
  <text start="3941.19" dur="9.03">election this is a plan a plot that has</text>
  <text start="3946.41" dur="6.72">been in place for decades so when I</text>
  <text start="3950.22" dur="9.47">think about Bernie Sanders current</text>
  <text start="3953.13" dur="12.179">movement I think about the current plan</text>
  <text start="3959.69" dur="9.339">which is agenda 2030 and how they want</text>
  <text start="3965.309" dur="6.631">to roll that out we&amp;#39;re approaching that</text>
  <text start="3969.029" dur="4.8">pretty quickly it may seem far away but</text>
  <text start="3971.94" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s not one day if we&amp;#39;re not paying</text>
  <text start="3973.829" dur="4.98">attention and we don&amp;#39;t do anything and</text>
  <text start="3975.93" dur="6.06">we don&amp;#39;t really start really trying to</text>
  <text start="3978.809" dur="4.98">oppose these socialist policies we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3981.99" dur="2.609">gonna wake up one day and say man how</text>
  <text start="3983.789" dur="7.07">did we get here</text>
  <text start="3984.599" dur="6.26">oh my god we&amp;#39;re in a socialist society</text>
  <text start="3991.579" dur="9.401">socialism is destructive it rips away</text>
  <text start="3996.75" dur="7.259">freedoms now another thing I want to</text>
  <text start="4000.98" dur="9.599">really throw in here is the fact that</text>
  <text start="4004.009" dur="12.631">amazon has now made a deal with the</text>
  <text start="4010.579" dur="7.941">Department of Defense for six hundred</text>
  <text start="4016.64" dur="5.91">million dollars</text>
  <text start="4018.52" dur="5.41">that&amp;#39;s a lot of money and also in</text>
  <text start="4022.55" dur="3.3">addition to that the government is</text>
  <text start="4023.93" dur="9.47">paying Jeff Bezos</text>
  <text start="4025.85" dur="7.55">ten billion dollars to store data</text>
  <text start="4035.32" dur="7.73">imagine</text>
  <text start="4037.79" dur="9.25">Amazon having control within the</text>
  <text start="4043.05" dur="8.49">Department of Defense also they want to</text>
  <text start="4047.04" dur="9.3">evolve this into a program where they</text>
  <text start="4051.54" dur="11.19">also are linked up with law enforcement</text>
  <text start="4056.34" dur="9.66">and security and of course this is only</text>
  <text start="4062.73" dur="6.06">a precursor to them really having</text>
  <text start="4066" dur="12.39">control over an entire government cloud</text>
  <text start="4068.79" dur="12.93">a real-life Big Brother so if any of you</text>
  <text start="4078.39" dur="4.47">have read 1984 you know what I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="4081.72" dur="5.79">about because this is the first thing</text>
  <text start="4082.86" dur="10.56">when I found out that Amazon this huge</text>
  <text start="4087.51" dur="8.19">tech monopoly is now connecting with the</text>
  <text start="4093.42" dur="6.54">Department of Defense as a precursor to</text>
  <text start="4095.7" dur="7.65">a government cloud they&amp;#39;re going to have</text>
  <text start="4099.96" dur="7.35">access to all of this data criminal</text>
  <text start="4103.35" dur="5.82">records tax records everything and not</text>
  <text start="4107.31" dur="4.44">to mention the fact that they have</text>
  <text start="4109.17" dur="6.839">drones which of course drones can go</text>
  <text start="4111.75" dur="6.81">anywhere and spy on you they will have</text>
  <text start="4116.009" dur="5.181">eyes on you at all the time at the same</text>
  <text start="4118.56" dur="8.61">time they have facial recognition</text>
  <text start="4121.19" dur="7.99">programming technology of which local</text>
  <text start="4127.17" dur="6.29">law enforcement some law enforcement are</text>
  <text start="4129.18" dur="8.34">already using and this technology can</text>
  <text start="4133.46" dur="7.2">recognize facial features and determine</text>
  <text start="4137.52" dur="6.69">your gender your age and even your</text>
  <text start="4140.66" dur="6.04">emotion certain emotions can be detected</text>
  <text start="4144.21" dur="4.109">by this technology this really is</text>
  <text start="4146.7" dur="6.329">dangerous especially when you think</text>
  <text start="4148.319" dur="7.891">about this other program is other harpa</text>
  <text start="4153.029" dur="6.48">I&amp;#39;ve talked about it before so harpa is</text>
  <text start="4156.21" dur="7.74">sort of like DARPA but the program</text>
  <text start="4159.509" dur="7.42">itself is meant to or at least they say</text>
  <text start="4163.95" dur="10.24">they say it&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="4166.929" dur="11.64">detect an individual&amp;#39;s mental stability</text>
  <text start="4174.19" dur="8.85">at any point in time so it monitors</text>
  <text start="4178.569" dur="8.471">individuals and can detect mental</text>
  <text start="4183.04" dur="6.099">statuses at any point in time and then</text>
  <text start="4187.04" dur="3.869">the government will need to take action</text>
  <text start="4189.139" dur="6.531">if they determined that that person is</text>
  <text start="4190.909" dur="4.761">mentally unstable at any point in time</text>
  <text start="4195.969" dur="6.011">so imagine if they took this facial</text>
  <text start="4199.219" dur="8.46">recognition technology and connected it</text>
  <text start="4201.98" dur="8.58">with harpa which is a program that will</text>
  <text start="4207.679" dur="4.531">monitor individuals to determine whether</text>
  <text start="4210.56" dur="5.94">or not they&amp;#39;re mentally stable at that</text>
  <text start="4212.21" dur="8.909">time and then the government will be</text>
  <text start="4216.5" dur="6.989">required to take action and I&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="4221.119" dur="8.941">asked this question before but what kind</text>
  <text start="4223.489" dur="8.871">of action are you talking about Big</text>
  <text start="4230.06" dur="2.3">Brother</text>
  <text start="4235.719" dur="5.52">this is something we should be paying</text>
  <text start="4237.61" dur="7.08">attention to because all of these things</text>
  <text start="4241.239" dur="8.091">that seem to be separate are really not</text>
  <text start="4244.69" dur="8.16">so we have the push for climate change</text>
  <text start="4249.33" dur="6.31">and of course Alexandria car suit Cortez</text>
  <text start="4252.85" dur="6.05">had talked about this at the rally and</text>
  <text start="4255.64" dur="5.46">then Bernie Sanders had really</text>
  <text start="4258.9" dur="7.42">congratulated her on being the first</text>
  <text start="4261.1" dur="8.16">person to really talk about the green</text>
  <text start="4266.32" dur="4.74">New Deal really but she wasn&amp;#39;t this was</text>
  <text start="4269.26" dur="3.93">a concept that was thought up well</text>
  <text start="4271.06" dur="4.32">before Alexandria co-hosted Court has</text>
  <text start="4273.19" dur="6.12">ever said anything about it but they</text>
  <text start="4275.38" dur="7.319">don&amp;#39;t want you to know that so climate</text>
  <text start="4279.31" dur="7.26">change hysteria extinction rebellion all</text>
  <text start="4282.699" dur="8.221">across the world just so happens to be a</text>
  <text start="4286.57" dur="8.78">worldwide protest then we have Amazon</text>
  <text start="4290.92" dur="8.94">the technology monopoly that is now</text>
  <text start="4295.35" dur="10.389">linking up to the military soon the</text>
  <text start="4299.86" dur="11.79">entire government this should be really</text>
  <text start="4305.739" dur="10.921">concerning and this whole movement with</text>
  <text start="4311.65" dur="7.86">Bernie Sanders it is not about whether</text>
  <text start="4316.66" dur="6.21">or not Bernie Sanders wins in 2020 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4319.51" dur="5.25">not about that that is too short term we</text>
  <text start="4322.87" dur="4.829">have to think about the effect that this</text>
  <text start="4324.76" dur="4.89">is having because we forget that he had</text>
  <text start="4327.699" dur="5.311">the popular vote for the Democrat</text>
  <text start="4329.65" dur="7.11">primary that means he had a huge amount</text>
  <text start="4333.01" dur="6.6">of support and it&amp;#39;s likely that support</text>
  <text start="4336.76" dur="5.729">has built up since then they have a</text>
  <text start="4339.61" dur="6.33">momentum going now they&amp;#39;re openly</text>
  <text start="4342.489" dur="8.701">Democratic Socialist so we have this</text>
  <text start="4345.94" dur="12.81">push towards socialism this goes beyond</text>
  <text start="4351.19" dur="12.95">2020 this is not just about 2020 we</text>
  <text start="4358.75" dur="5.39">cannot allow this to manifest</text>
  <text start="4365.93" dur="8.5">we cannot allow this because if</text>
  <text start="4371.09" dur="5.2">socialism creeps up without us paying</text>
  <text start="4374.43" dur="2.37">attention we will lose all of our</text>
  <text start="4376.29" dur="7.83">freedoms</text>
