  <text start="301.49" dur="3.06">gym</text>
  <text start="302.15" dur="3.87">are they workout rooms above the gym and</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="3.57">you could look over the side and hear</text>
  <text start="306.02" dur="5.28">the sound that you heard in the video</text>
  <text start="308.12" dur="4.68">and it was just like wow several weeks</text>
  <text start="311.3" dur="3.2">of that and I finally got the nerve to</text>
  <text start="312.8" dur="5.85">go downstairs and ask him what it was</text>
  <text start="314.5" dur="6.52">they invited me in I played my first you</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="4.98">know day of two hours without stopping</text>
  <text start="321.02" dur="5.09">and when I got home I couldn&amp;#39;t hardly</text>
  <text start="323.63" dur="6.3">get out of the car my joints were</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="7.27">screaming at me I was so sore and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="329.93" dur="5.46">had to Tundra to torn rotator cuffs for</text>
  <text start="333.38" dur="6">over 25 years</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="6.06">I two days before surgery I i watched</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="4.2">something on the internet about how poor</text>
  <text start="341.45" dur="3.96">that surgery outcomes were and i said</text>
  <text start="343.58" dur="2.55">forget it I&amp;#39;ll learn how to bowl and</text>
  <text start="345.41" dur="3.3">play golf</text>
  <text start="346.13" dur="5.34">kind of with my arms tied beneath with</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="5.88">you spying yeah yeah it was like okay</text>
  <text start="351.47" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;ll accommodate but boy when you start</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="4.17">to do an overhead smash like you see in</text>
  <text start="357.17" dur="3.41">that you don&amp;#39;t get very many of those</text>
  <text start="358.76" dur="5.37">before you can&amp;#39;t lift your arms anymore</text>
  <text start="360.58" dur="5.4">so I looked into the various treatments</text>
  <text start="364.13" dur="4.53">I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna go back for surgery and</text>
  <text start="365.98" dur="6.25">my chiropractor told me about something</text>
  <text start="368.66" dur="7.23">in Texas where I live before a called</text>
  <text start="372.23" dur="5.82">PRP which is platelet-rich plasma a lot</text>
  <text start="375.89" dur="5.06">of the sports teams use it basically</text>
  <text start="378.05" dur="5.25">they draw blood out of your your arm and</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="4.51">put some vitamins in it they&amp;#39;ll spin it</text>
  <text start="383.3" dur="4.77">out and put some painkiller and shove it</text>
  <text start="385.46" dur="5.64">back in but they they irritate the bone</text>
  <text start="388.07" dur="4.92">around the tendons so that you know your</text>
  <text start="391.1" dur="5.76">body&amp;#39;s defenses will come in and try to</text>
  <text start="392.99" dur="5.49">to help you repair that and I went</text>
  <text start="396.86" dur="7.26">through that for almost three years and</text>
  <text start="398.48" dur="8.13">I got a lot of mobility back but I just</text>
  <text start="404.12" dur="4.04">wasn&amp;#39;t quite there with with my</text>
  <text start="406.61" dur="3.99">shoulders and everything I decided</text>
  <text start="408.16" dur="5.38">during that same time I saw</text>
  <text start="410.6" dur="7.59">cliff high interviewed on Sara Westall</text>
  <text start="413.54" dur="6.87">show mention c60 yeah I am a sucker for</text>
  <text start="418.19" dur="5.49">anything new I mean my wife and I will</text>
  <text start="420.41" dur="7.5">try anything once and so we bought it</text>
  <text start="423.68" dur="7.38">and at the same time I was thinking</text>
  <text start="427.91" dur="7.08">about this stem-cell therapy and so I</text>
  <text start="431.06" dur="10.89">had been on c64 at least a year various</text>
  <text start="434.99" dur="9.39">brands and I I went in for the treatment</text>
  <text start="441.95" dur="5.12">this past August and as you see in the</text>
  <text start="444.38" dur="5.67">video they literally had pictures of</text>
  <text start="447.07" dur="5.38">yeah is the excellent those are the stem</text>
  <text start="450.05" dur="5.1">cells those are those are the stem cells</text>
  <text start="452.45" dur="5.22">in your body and they they had told a</text>
  <text start="455.15" dur="5.97">friend of mine about this and I play</text>
  <text start="457.67" dur="8.1">pickleball with Islam was 94 years old</text>
  <text start="461.12" dur="7.77">and she was a dancer on Broadway and in</text>
  <text start="465.77" dur="5.61">fact was the model for for Pall Mall or</text>
  <text start="468.89" dur="4.89">old gold cigarettes that was her you</text>
  <text start="471.38" dur="5.25">know well now she&amp;#39;s get had all that</text>
  <text start="473.78" dur="5.64">abuse and so he took her to this doctor</text>
  <text start="476.63" dur="4.89">up in in north side of Indianapolis and</text>
  <text start="479.42" dur="4.11">he told me about it and when they</text>
  <text start="481.52" dur="4.41">measure her they said you know we get</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="4.92">six million cells you know we can do the</text>
  <text start="485.93" dur="4.23">procedure if not you know we&amp;#39;ll just we</text>
  <text start="488.45" dur="3.57">won&amp;#39;t charge anything for draw on it but</text>
  <text start="490.16" dur="5.31">you know send her on her way well she</text>
  <text start="492.02" dur="6.75">had like 12 or 13 million and it gave</text>
  <text start="495.47" dur="8.94">her a you know a lot more time without</text>
  <text start="498.77" dur="7.68">paint and so it didn&amp;#39;t repair her her</text>
  <text start="504.41" dur="4.35">hip joint which was gone but everything</text>
  <text start="506.45" dur="6.63">else she had these these great results</text>
  <text start="508.76" dur="6.83">so I thought stem cell not from like</text>
  <text start="513.08" dur="5.19">fetus some people still think it&amp;#39;s over</text>
  <text start="515.59" dur="5.53">you don&amp;#39;t these are your own stem cells</text>
  <text start="518.27" dur="7.23">from your fat tissue right right and</text>
  <text start="521.12" dur="8.19">this particular procedure is because</text>
  <text start="525.5" dur="7.23">they take your own your own cells they</text>
  <text start="529.31" dur="5.15">do it in a closed loop so basically they</text>
  <text start="532.73" dur="3.99">can give you back your own stem cells</text>
  <text start="534.46" dur="4.45">which is probably a lot healthier I</text>
  <text start="536.72" dur="3.75">think like when you when you get the way</text>
  <text start="538.91" dur="3.27">they were talking about doing it the old</text>
  <text start="540.47" dur="3.37">way with babies and such now and get a</text>
  <text start="542.18" dur="3.1">baby soul which wants to turn into a</text>
  <text start="543.84" dur="6.26">organs that&amp;#39;s not appropriate for an</text>
  <text start="545.28" dur="7.95">adult anyway or they can give you a</text>
  <text start="550.1" dur="6.31">simple which is adult stem cell it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.23" dur="7.08">really the mother that you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="556.41" dur="8.73">somebody else&amp;#39;s and I was gonna do that</text>
  <text start="560.31" dur="7.11">until I read this book yeah really or</text>
  <text start="565.14" dur="4.14">freezing their their uterine cords and</text>
  <text start="567.42" dur="3.99">such you know the umbilical cords now</text>
  <text start="569.28" dur="6.78">Wow there&amp;#39;s a storm that a woman would</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="6.3">sign when she has has a c-section that</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="4.32">says you know you can keep it or you can</text>
  <text start="577.71" dur="5.16">donate and it&amp;#39;s actually quite viable or</text>
  <text start="580.38" dur="4.59">valuable and you know this starts</text>
  <text start="582.87" dur="3.84">getting into the area where you start</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="5.1">wondering about these stories you hear</text>
  <text start="586.71" dur="5.85">today about adrenochrome and all that</text>
  <text start="590.07" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re talking about our own stories</text>
  <text start="592.56" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;ve heard some bad stories about</text>
  <text start="593.79" dur="4.32">hospitals and babies for sure yeah</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s why I always try to like preface</text>
  <text start="598.11" dur="3.87">everything like this is talking about</text>
  <text start="599.76" dur="4.26">the good part of science that yes your</text>
  <text start="601.98" dur="4.35">own stem cells from your own fat tissues</text>
  <text start="604.02" dur="4.83">whereas there are people out there doing</text>
  <text start="606.33" dur="5.19">bad things that are within the same area</text>
  <text start="608.85" dur="4.01">and give it a bad name which is you know</text>
  <text start="611.52" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s unfortunate</text>
  <text start="612.86" dur="7.75">right and I prove I can provide you with</text>
  <text start="617.19" dur="5.79">a PDF of the book I read before I did</text>
  <text start="620.61" dur="4.38">this that explains the difference and if</text>
  <text start="622.98" dur="3.63">you if your readers want that they can</text>
  <text start="624.99" dur="4.44">they certainly can download it for your</text>
  <text start="626.61" dur="5.49">charge from from the link and in this</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="6.39">video so I&amp;#39;ll be glad to send that to</text>
  <text start="632.1" dur="8.16">you awesome yeah so we did see 60 come</text>
  <text start="635.82" dur="6.98">in for you um well the funny thing was</text>
  <text start="640.26" dur="5.94">is that the day that I had the surgery</text>
  <text start="642.8" dur="7.24">or the procedure it&amp;#39;s not really surgery</text>
  <text start="646.2" dur="5.93">it&amp;#39;s a procedure I&amp;#39;d received a video</text>
  <text start="650.04" dur="2.09">from</text>
  <text start="653.79" dur="6.15">one of the c60 providers out there and</text>
  <text start="656.31" dur="5.31">in the video and I was listening to it</text>
  <text start="659.94" dur="3.57">during the procedure because it takes it</text>
  <text start="661.62" dur="4.709">takes a couple hours to draw draw the</text>
  <text start="663.51" dur="5.579">fat and and all that and it&amp;#39;s just like</text>
  <text start="666.329" dur="5.781">it&amp;#39;s a mini liposuction is what it is so</text>
  <text start="669.089" dur="5.131">they&amp;#39;ve been doing that for 30 years</text>
  <text start="672.11" dur="4.839">lose weight and that&amp;#39;s where your stem</text>
  <text start="674.22" dur="5.179">cells are are stored so they took it out</text>
  <text start="676.949" dur="5.401">of my belly so I&amp;#39;m laying on this table</text>
  <text start="679.399" dur="4.99">and I got my ear pods in and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="682.35" dur="4.2">listening to this video and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="684.389" dur="4.711">the time that this guy is pumping on my</text>
  <text start="686.55" dur="4.02">belly getting the fat out I&amp;#39;m hearing</text>
  <text start="689.1" dur="4.2">him talk about you know one of the side</text>
  <text start="690.57" dur="5.759">things that has been reported has been</text>
  <text start="693.3" dur="7.56">stem cells have increased for some of</text>
  <text start="696.329" dur="6.57">people taking c60 and and I&amp;#39;m like what</text>
  <text start="700.86" dur="4.83">are the odds of me laying here on the</text>
  <text start="702.899" dur="4.891">table having this done but right before</text>
  <text start="705.69" dur="6.36">they count him I wonder how many I will</text>
  <text start="707.79" dur="6.419">have and so so you&amp;#39;re already taking it</text>
  <text start="712.05" dur="5.849">at this point I&amp;#39;d been taking it for a</text>
  <text start="714.209" dur="6.961">year so I&amp;#39;ve had a year of c60 at least</text>
  <text start="717.899" dur="7.5">before I went in but I didn&amp;#39;t do that on</text>
  <text start="721.17" dur="5.7">purpose just the timing I was just it</text>
  <text start="725.399" dur="3.451">was quite a coincidence that you heard</text>
  <text start="726.87" dur="5.25">that rather than getting it done so yeah</text>
  <text start="728.85" dur="5.94">grazie yeah so I got we have to they</text>
  <text start="732.12" dur="5.399">what they do is they put an enzyme in in</text>
  <text start="734.79" dur="5.63">the fat and it causes the fact is all</text>
  <text start="737.519" dur="7.5">the way and all you&amp;#39;re left with is the</text>
  <text start="740.42" dur="7.539">the the red or pinky slick looks like</text>
  <text start="745.019" dur="7.471">blood that&amp;#39;s in those syringes it was in</text>
  <text start="747.959" dur="5.971">the video and so we go to lunch while</text>
  <text start="752.49" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re getting you&amp;#39;re doing that and</text>
  <text start="753.93" dur="5.37">then come back and I&amp;#39;m gonna I did my</text>
  <text start="756.18" dur="6">knee and I did both shoulders and so</text>
  <text start="759.3" dur="7.43">they come into the room and they give me</text>
  <text start="762.18" dur="7.5">a painkiller and I knee and they leave</text>
  <text start="766.73" dur="5.049">they put oh they also put me on a I got</text>
  <text start="769.68" dur="5.399">to have some of the stem cells back into</text>
  <text start="771.779" dur="4.74">my bloodstream which is only they can</text>

  <text start="798.389" dur="5.7">guys the orthopedic surgeon I had and</text>
  <text start="800.579" dur="6.06">another physician came rushing into the</text>
  <text start="804.089" dur="4.891">room both ardently dude what are you</text>
  <text start="806.639" dur="5.461">doing I&amp;#39;m just like what do you anyone</text>
  <text start="808.98" dur="5.609">might doing what your stem cell count is</text>
  <text start="812.1" dur="6.63">out of sight you had 73 million total</text>
  <text start="814.589" dur="5.94">stem cells and you know that&amp;#39;s the stem</text>
  <text start="818.73" dur="4.02">that&amp;#39;s this counter of a twenty-year-old</text>
  <text start="820.529" dur="5.881">what what are you doing yeah and I said</text>
  <text start="822.75" dur="4.98">well I&amp;#39;m taking c60 and they said well</text>
  <text start="826.41" dur="2.52">we don&amp;#39;t know anything about that but</text>
  <text start="827.73" dur="3.57">whatever you doing keep doing it because</text>
  <text start="828.93" dur="4.95">that is amazing and this and they were</text>
  <text start="831.3" dur="7.32">holding this up this is liquid gold for</text>
  <text start="833.88" dur="6.449">you know I was that&amp;#39;s impressive and man</text>
  <text start="838.62" dur="3.209">I don&amp;#39;t know like kind of the average</text>
  <text start="840.329" dur="3.93">did they give you any kind of numbers to</text>
  <text start="841.829" dur="5.13">to base that off all of this frame of</text>
  <text start="844.259" dur="4.921">reference he didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="846.959" dur="5.221">see any kind of a sliding scale of what</text>
  <text start="849.18" dur="7.56">a twenty-year-old have but is now that</text>
  <text start="852.18" dur="8.04">the in in the video you you saw that</text>
  <text start="856.74" dur="6.36">there is a percentage of stem cells what</text>
  <text start="860.22" dur="5.849">they call viable count so you you have</text>
  <text start="863.1" dur="6.299">so many stem cells in your body and as</text>
  <text start="866.069" dur="5.221">as those telomeres shorten and shorten</text>
  <text start="869.399" dur="3.721">and shorten at they when they get down</text>
  <text start="871.29" dur="4.669">to nothing in them they become what are</text>
  <text start="873.12" dur="6.42">called zombie cells or senescent cells</text>
  <text start="875.959" dur="7.12">and so they&amp;#39;re just there as part of the</text>
  <text start="879.54" dur="5.159">count so the next thing is to figure out</text>
  <text start="883.079" dur="4.591">you know how do you get rid of those</text>
  <text start="884.699" dur="5.82">those zombie cells and make more room so</text>
  <text start="887.67" dur="5.13">you know the fact that I had that many</text>
  <text start="890.519" dur="6.661">cells and they&amp;#39;d never seen that before</text>
  <text start="892.8" dur="5.969">and tells me that yeah it could be 18</text>
  <text start="897.18" dur="6.36">years of organic food but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>

  <text start="950.279" dur="3.961">part of the c60 but I&amp;#39;ve heard many</text>
  <text start="951.839" dur="4.081">people say faster recovery times and</text>
  <text start="954.24" dur="5.099">easier workouts that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="955.92" dur="5.19">Rommels yeah that is exciting so thing</text>
  <text start="959.339" dur="3.87">is something that you know I only</text>

  <text start="968.009" dur="4.531">benefits but this stem cell thing is</text>
  <text start="969.72" dur="5.88">just one more to add in the pilot I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="972.54" dur="5.52">excited about this material honestly all</text>
  <text start="975.6" dur="6.659">of us that are taking this and are part</text>
  <text start="978.06" dur="7.469">of a grand experiment and one of the</text>
  <text start="982.259" dur="6.991">things that I had found at my age of</text>
  <text start="985.529" dur="5.701">thinking is like you know the the</text>
  <text start="989.25" dur="3.809">Bible&amp;#39;s talks about you know every man&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="993.059" dur="7.2">seventy years I&amp;#39;m on I&amp;#39;m on borrowed</text>
  <text start="994.889" dur="9">time now and infused if you accept the</text>
  <text start="1000.259" dur="8.18">limitations that you think those are the</text>
  <text start="1003.889" dur="6.99">limitations you&amp;#39;ll have and and so</text>
  <text start="1008.439" dur="4.811">understanding what c60 is doing with</text>
  <text start="1010.879" dur="6.39">stem cells and learning about telomeres</text>
  <text start="1013.25" dur="6.93">all of a sudden you think no I think</text>
  <text start="1017.269" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;ll choose the 120 year plan let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1020.18" dur="1.769">see how we keep long we can keep this</text>
  <text start="1021.559" dur="2.85">going</text>

  <text start="1035.12" dur="5.13">runner a guy who ran and you know</text>
  <text start="1038.27" dur="4.83">somebody asked him about why he did it</text>
  <text start="1040.25" dur="7.949">just because it&amp;#39;s because I feel God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1043.1" dur="9.75">pleasure when I run I feel that when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1048.199" dur="6.761">able to play at a potential that is way</text>
  <text start="1052.85" dur="4.24">above where my age group</text>
  <text start="1054.96" dur="6.57">would normally be thought of this</text>
  <text start="1057.09" dur="7.02">playing and and it&amp;#39;s just it is it just</text>
