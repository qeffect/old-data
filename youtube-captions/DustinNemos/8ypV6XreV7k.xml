  <text start="71.39" dur="4.17">crazy day I mean dozens of Congress</text>
  <text start="73.58" dur="3.66">people as house representatives going on</text>
  <text start="75.56" dur="3.24">the floor speaking their mind basically</text>
  <text start="77.24" dur="3.21">the left repeating the same talking</text>
  <text start="78.8" dur="3.69">points over and over and over and over</text>
  <text start="80.45" dur="4.589">with no real argument to back them off</text>
  <text start="82.49" dur="5.31">no evidence just emotional you know</text>

  <text start="92.649" dur="4.841">emotional perspective I mean he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="95.42" dur="3.36">it with conviction deep conviction but</text>
  <text start="97.49" dur="4.199">they have no facts behind and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="98.78" dur="5.04">just psychopathic liars and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="101.689" dur="3.961">using their weasel words and snake fork</text>
  <text start="103.82" dur="4.14">to snake tongues to lie about our</text>
  <text start="105.65" dur="4.62">president now of course the Republicans</text>
  <text start="107.96" dur="5.31">did a great job defending but the house</text>
  <text start="110.27" dur="4.77">numbers were against us so CNN</text>
  <text start="113.27" dur="4.739">impeachment poll has bad news for</text>
  <text start="115.04" dur="4.41">Democrats however even on CNN the polls</text>
  <text start="118.009" dur="5.22">are saying that support among Democrats</text>
  <text start="119.45" dur="6.18">has dropped by double digits that is a</text>
  <text start="123.229" dur="5.28">pretty big deal in and of itself we also</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="4.949">have in 1998 Nadler took the position</text>
  <text start="128.509" dur="4.501">that impeachment without bipartisan</text>
  <text start="130.579" dur="4.951">support was wrong and would tear the</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="3.93">country apart for years to come if it</text>
  <text start="135.53" dur="3.33">weren&amp;#39;t for double standards they have</text>

  <text start="140.9" dur="5.22">this one</text>
  <text start="142.989" dur="4.991">Vence The effect of impeachment is to</text>
  <text start="146.12" dur="4.229">overturn the popular will of the voters</text>
  <text start="147.98" dur="4.83">we must not overturn an election and</text>
  <text start="150.349" dur="4.081">remove a president from office except to</text>
  <text start="152.81" dur="3.87">defend our system of government or our</text>
  <text start="154.43" dur="4.529">constitutional liberties against the</text>
  <text start="156.68" dur="4.02">dire threat and we must not do so</text>
  <text start="158.959" dur="4.5">without an overwhelming consensus of the</text>
  <text start="160.7" dur="5.16">American people there must never be a</text>
  <text start="163.459" dur="3.841">narrowly voted impeachment or an</text>
  <text start="165.86" dur="3.659">impeachment supported by one of our</text>
  <text start="167.3" dur="4.35">major political parties and opposed by</text>
  <text start="169.519" dur="3.75">the other such an impeachment will</text>
  <text start="171.65" dur="3.69">produce the device of this and</text>
  <text start="173.269" dur="4.111">bitterness in our politics for years to</text>
  <text start="175.34" dur="3.99">come and will call into question the</text>
  <text start="177.38" dur="4.439">very legitimacy of our political</text>
  <text start="179.33" dur="3.84">institutions the American people have</text>
  <text start="181.819" dur="3.39">heard the allegations against the</text>
  <text start="183.17" dur="5.34">president and they overwhelmingly oppose</text>
  <text start="185.209" dur="5.64">impeaching him bench if that&amp;#39;s not for</text>
  <text start="188.51" dur="4.319">that one so here you have it even in</text>
  <text start="190.849" dur="4.681">Adler&amp;#39;s own words he&amp;#39;s a hypocrite he</text>
  <text start="192.829" dur="4.141">had a good argument at the time but he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.53" dur="3.539">changed his mind because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="196.97" dur="4.17">polemic politically expedient for him</text>
  <text start="199.069" dur="3.151">now he kind of looks like that guy from</text>

  <text start="204.29" dur="3.77">lost a lot of weight and that takes</text>
  <text start="205.76" dur="4.44">willpower and it takes consistency and</text>
  <text start="208.06" dur="3.85">congratulations to you you know I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="3.75">want to see anyone suffer on health but</text>

  <text start="213.95" dur="3.509">liar you know you&amp;#39;re probably gonna go</text>
  <text start="215.63" dur="3.63">to get Moe for treason so you&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="217.459" dur="3.991">plenty of time to get some exercise in</text>

  <text start="256.31" dur="4.709">just called it sick didn&amp;#39;t really even</text>
  <text start="258.169" dur="6.951">respond to it but kind of did I guess</text>
  <text start="261.019" dur="5.941">just insulting it however rather than</text>
  <text start="265.12" dur="3.37">trying to think that he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="266.96" dur="4.32">convince her or change her mind or</text>
  <text start="268.49" dur="4.56">anything this is more of a kind of</text>
  <text start="271.28" dur="3.42">on-the-record thing like if you&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="273.05" dur="3.06">legal dispute something like that</text>

  <text start="289.96" dur="5.44">president Trump&amp;#39;s letter to Pelosi but</text>
  <text start="293.87" dur="2.61">basically he was saying that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="295.4" dur="3.57">think you&amp;#39;re gonna change your mind I</text>
  <text start="296.48" dur="5.39">just want my words on the record you</text>

  <text start="330.38" dur="3.63">the Senate unless they bow to her demand</text>
  <text start="332.09" dur="3.39">so if they don&amp;#39;t get what they want the</text>

  <text start="345.71" dur="3.32">investigation in perpetuity forever</text>
  <text start="347.36" dur="3.99">because that&amp;#39;s what the house is doing</text>
  <text start="349.03" dur="5.35">investigate investigate forever to try</text>

  <text start="361.88" dur="4.44">definitely have an eyelash in my eye so</text>
  <text start="364.61" dur="5.28">forgive me here something is definitely</text>
