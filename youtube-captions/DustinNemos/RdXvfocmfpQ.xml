  <text start="8.37" dur="4.889">about getting the news video out late</text>
  <text start="10.019" dur="5.341">but we had more Q and I did a live chat</text>
  <text start="13.259" dur="3.511">discussion for a while where we talked</text>
  <text start="15.36" dur="4.65">about some news we talked a lot about</text>
  <text start="16.77" dur="4.98">Alex Jones we talked about Q and Q or</text>
  <text start="20.01" dur="4.23">Alex Jones is kind of a choice now you</text>
  <text start="21.75" dur="4.59">can&amp;#39;t really be for both anymore it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="24.24" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s it really has come down to one of</text>
  <text start="26.34" dur="4.349">the other if you trust Hugh then and</text>
  <text start="28.71" dur="5.099">Alex Jones a Mossad agent disinformation</text>
  <text start="30.689" dur="5.191">guy and and if you trust Alex Jones well</text>
  <text start="33.809" dur="4.051">he talked to Q and Q&amp;#39;s fake so it&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="35.88" dur="4.98">to you make up your own mind do your</text>
  <text start="37.86" dur="4.68">homework please check out my arguments</text>
  <text start="40.86" dur="4.17">if you&amp;#39;re interested in them about why</text>
  <text start="42.54" dur="6.72">I&amp;#39;ve chosen to trust Q and not Alex</text>
  <text start="45.03" dur="6.99">Jones but let&amp;#39;s jump into the news for</text>
  <text start="49.26" dur="4.95">those of you who know vixx we&amp;#39;re he is</text>
  <text start="52.02" dur="4.679">an interesting figure especially in like</text>
  <text start="54.21" dur="4.71">precious metals and cryptocurrency area</text>
  <text start="56.699" dur="5.281">but he&amp;#39;s reporting that the US Mint is</text>
  <text start="58.92" dur="5.97">now illegally cutting off silver eagles</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="4.679">sales soon which makes no sense because</text>
  <text start="64.89" dur="3.45">why would they be running out of silver</text>
  <text start="66.659" dur="3.811">if the price is so down right now like</text>
  <text start="68.34" dur="3.75">it wasn&amp;#39;t nobody mourning silver you</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="3.509">know just piece of junk nobody wants</text>
  <text start="72.09" dur="3.93">that stuff because if you looked at the</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="6.541">price 19 13 levels I mean it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="6.09">insane I think the it may be soon that</text>
  <text start="80.52" dur="2.91">the manipulation comes to an end and</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="3.03">those who have been holding on the</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="3.24">silver and gold their whole the whole</text>
  <text start="85.14" dur="3.21">lives waiting for this to happen you</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="3.239">know it&amp;#39;s been a while with ETF</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="2.479">manipulation going on I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="89.909" dur="4.32">coming to an end</text>
  <text start="90.829" dur="5.921">apparently JP Morgan is closing out a</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="5.1">massive silver short position as well so</text>
  <text start="96.75" dur="4.049">you know so a short position is is</text>
  <text start="99.329" dur="4.65">basically a bet that silver is going to</text>
  <text start="100.799" dur="5.491">go down in price and this is yet another</text>
  <text start="103.979" dur="4.261">kind of sign of that line of thinking</text>
  <text start="106.29" dur="2.82">that maybe maybe the manipulation is</text>
  <text start="108.24" dur="2.669">coming to an end</text>
  <text start="109.11" dur="5.549">maybe people are gonna go long or</text>
  <text start="110.909" dur="7.35">betting that it goes up we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="114.659" dur="4.981">US Attorney Joe digenova or did you know</text>
  <text start="118.259" dur="3.781">if I don&amp;#39;t know how to say that</text>

  <text start="162.03" dur="3.3">this is for personal interest as well</text>

  <text start="174.45" dur="3.72">and I hope that I get to be part of that</text>
  <text start="176.34" dur="3.81">I don&amp;#39;t exactly know how class-action</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="3.72">work from the from the perspective of</text>
  <text start="180.15" dur="3.87">joining one and being part of it but I</text>
  <text start="181.89" dur="4.98">think I qualify and I think that I have</text>
  <text start="184.02" dur="4.5">monetary losses you know I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve my</text>
  <text start="186.87" dur="3.42">finances were definitely affected when</text>
  <text start="188.52" dur="3.66">they censored my channel for no reason</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="4.68">except telling the truth and being a</text>
  <text start="192.18" dur="4.47">reporter and doing my job and you know</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="6.06">all the censorship ever since then</text>
  <text start="196.65" dur="7.47">well I&amp;#39;m documenting Zero Hedge is</text>
  <text start="201.03" dur="6.15">reporting that social media companies</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="5.13">may be hurting competition and stifling</text>

  <text start="219.33" dur="7.53">Kasich actually he actually Kasich is it</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="6.42">Kasich Kasich I think he actually said</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="5.07">McCain was put to death instead of put</text>
  <text start="230.04" dur="3.45">to rest or whatever it is that others</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="3.9">are trying to say they&amp;#39;re trying to say</text>
  <text start="233.49" dur="3.9">he made a slip but I think it might have</text>
  <text start="235.83" dur="4.53">been a Freudian slip because put to</text>
  <text start="237.39" dur="4.83">death that&amp;#39;s pretty darn that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="240.36" dur="3.45">change you know he didn&amp;#39;t double take he</text>
  <text start="242.22" dur="4.14">didn&amp;#39;t correct himself as far as I know</text>
  <text start="243.81" dur="6.179">he just had put to death you know during</text>
  <text start="246.36" dur="7.05">a discussion so that&amp;#39;s interesting now</text>
  <text start="249.989" dur="4.951">you know to intelligence officials have</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="5.009">come forward and they&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="254.94" dur="5.37">building a compilation data site for for</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="4.111">Spygate you know all of the stuff going</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="3.96">on with Trump is for everyone to use and</text>
  <text start="262.53" dur="2.1">see but they&amp;#39;re kind of building it for</text>
  <text start="264.27" dur="2.7">the Trump</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="3.96">team to use I think and this is a there</text>
  <text start="266.97" dur="3.39">is generating a lot of buzz a lot of</text>
  <text start="268.59" dur="3.51">excitement so this project is going to</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="3.18">be something that I will definitely be</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="3.57">talking about in the future we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="273.54" dur="4.44">what happens with it I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.67" dur="5.94">supposed to start tomorrow so we&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="277.98" dur="5.27">what happens with that and Cory Booker</text>
  <text start="281.61" dur="4.17">came out saying that he was gonna</text>
  <text start="283.25" dur="4.21">willfully violate House Rules and even</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="4.86">if they kicked him out and just bring it</text>
  <text start="287.46" dur="6.57">all this stuff saying he he had chosen</text>
  <text start="290.64" dur="5.73">to expose some confidential emails from</text>
  <text start="294.03" dur="6.51">Cavanaugh discussing racial profiling in</text>
  <text start="296.37" dur="6.72">a shortly after 9/11 situation the</text>
  <text start="300.54" dur="4.38">fascinating thing is that one it later</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="3.6">came out that Cory Booker was lying his</text>
  <text start="304.92" dur="3.84">ass off these were these weren&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="306.69" dur="3.72">confidential emails by the time he did</text>
  <text start="308.76" dur="3.36">it they were already he was given</text>
  <text start="310.41" dur="3.18">approval that morning and then he did it</text>
  <text start="312.12" dur="4.34">that night saying look at me I&amp;#39;m like a</text>
  <text start="313.59" dur="5.04">Spartacus moment I&amp;#39;m a badass look at me</text>
  <text start="316.46" dur="3.67">because I&amp;#39;m breaking the rules to get</text>
  <text start="318.63" dur="3.42">this out he wasn&amp;#39;t breaking the rules</text>
  <text start="320.13" dur="3.36">he&amp;#39;s just trying to he literally made a</text>
  <text start="322.05" dur="4.64">statement about how he felt like he was</text>
  <text start="323.49" dur="6.42">in Spartacus I&amp;#39;m not lying</text>
  <text start="326.69" dur="5.32">these people&amp;#39;s ego and then low IQ I</text>
  <text start="329.91" dur="3.42">swear but the interesting thing about</text>
  <text start="332.01" dur="3.03">the documents actually show that</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="4.2">Cavanaugh was discussing security</text>
  <text start="335.04" dur="5.64">concerns but he wanted to be race</text>
  <text start="337.53" dur="4.86">neutral so the whole point of the email</text>
  <text start="340.68" dur="4.65">was to somehow paint him as racist and</text>
  <text start="342.39" dur="5.13">then once again it just doesn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s no argument there&amp;#39;s no evidence</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="3.57">for it of course they&amp;#39;ll run with it</text>
  <text start="349.2" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ll call him racist and and and they</text>
  <text start="351.09" dur="3.81">know the left won&amp;#39;t bother to read any</text>
  <text start="353.58" dur="5.87">of these emails they won&amp;#39;t bother to</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="8.19">verify and according to recent research</text>
  <text start="359.45" dur="5.43">THC that&amp;#39;s cannabis marijuana might be</text>
  <text start="363.09" dur="5.22">useful for treating people with dementia</text>
  <text start="364.88" dur="5.8">because of its beneficial effects on the</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="3.99">aging brain now I&amp;#39;ve talked about it</text>
  <text start="370.68" dur="3.33">before but the brain has cannabinoid</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="4.86">receptors in humans and I also I think</text>
  <text start="374.01" dur="4.83">in dogs I&amp;#39;m not sure about cats so our</text>
  <text start="377.16" dur="3.87">brains are actually designed to have</text>
  <text start="378.84" dur="5.46">this reception of cannabinoids</text>
  <text start="381.03" dur="5.28">okay so cannabinoids from cannabis or</text>
  <text start="384.3" dur="3.86">marijuana that the name that they gave</text>
  <text start="386.31" dur="4.35">it to demonize it make it sound like</text>
  <text start="388.16" dur="4.24">some sort of I don&amp;#39;t know evil Mexican</text>
  <text start="390.66" dur="3.6">weed or something I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="392.4" dur="3.269">why they called it marijuana but you</text>
  <text start="394.26" dur="3.7">know if you if you follow the history of</text>
  <text start="395.669" dur="5.5">this plant this this medical or</text>
  <text start="397.96" dur="4.829">it has fascinating history you could you</text>
  <text start="401.169" dur="3.15">used to be able use it to pay your taxes</text>
  <text start="402.789" dur="3.391">with in fact we were importing it</text>
  <text start="404.319" dur="3.151">because we made it illegal so we</text>
  <text start="406.18" dur="4.25">couldn&amp;#39;t grow it anymore so then I</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="6.3">started to import it for government use</text>
  <text start="410.43" dur="6.01">but it actually is a wonder plant in</text>
  <text start="413.77" dur="5.07">terms of its medical abilities and its</text>
  <text start="416.44" dur="6.18">industrial abilities we could we could</text>
  <text start="418.84" dur="5.639">eliminate deforestation and you know we</text>
  <text start="422.62" dur="3.21">could make paper out of it I mean</text>
  <text start="424.479" dur="3.651">there&amp;#39;s a million uses for this stuff</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="5.04">not even including its medical benefits</text>
  <text start="428.13" dur="6.94">but cannabinoid receptors are basically</text>
  <text start="430.87" dur="5.82">designed to to receive this stuff and it</text>
  <text start="435.07" dur="3.21">has sort of a lubrication effect on the</text>
  <text start="436.69" dur="4.56">brain it&amp;#39;s like will for your car it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.28" dur="5.3">pretty good for you but this is yet</text>
  <text start="441.25" dur="4.919">another study and the research there and</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="4.66">and that is interesting I think I like</text>
  <text start="446.169" dur="3.331">to share this stuff for people every</text>
  <text start="448.24" dur="3.87">once in a while I know I get some</text>
  <text start="449.5" dur="4.86">pushback when I talk about marijuana but</text>
  <text start="452.11" dur="5.399">you know I&amp;#39;m a holistic guy I like</text>
  <text start="454.36" dur="6.929">natural plants and I&amp;#39;ve been through not</text>
  <text start="457.509" dur="6.061">only massive pain and having to deal</text>
  <text start="461.289" dur="4.651">with that pain by prescription opioid</text>
  <text start="463.57" dur="6.569">drugs you know when I got ran over and</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="6.18">I&amp;#39;ve also had my entire family my entire</text>
  <text start="470.139" dur="3.77">immediate family except my dad I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="8.4">talking mother brother sister and aunt</text>
  <text start="473.909" dur="8.56">all destroyed by opioid use so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="4.11">no harm in this plant it&amp;#39;s never killed</text>
  <text start="482.469" dur="4.861">anyone it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt people you know</text>
  <text start="484.63" dur="5.879">people who say it&amp;#39;s bad they&amp;#39;re still of</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="4.86">that that opinion like the government</text>
  <text start="490.509" dur="2.94">did a good job at demonizing this stuff</text>
  <text start="492.19" dur="2.64">they took it to all the schools they</text>
  <text start="493.449" dur="3.06">made this documentary called reefer</text>
  <text start="494.83" dur="3.63">madness back in the day they took it to</text>
  <text start="496.509" dur="3.361">all the the parent-teacher meetings and</text>
  <text start="498.46" dur="3.179">they just sort of pushed the idea that</text>
  <text start="499.87" dur="3.299">this stuff would make your kids crazy</text>
  <text start="501.639" dur="3.511">make them drop out of school they can</text>
  <text start="503.169" dur="3.691">become prostitutes and murderers and</text>
  <text start="505.15" dur="4.949">crazy drug addicts and everything else</text>
  <text start="506.86" dur="5.929">and it&amp;#39;s not the case it just isn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="510.099" dur="4.921">case it does make some people lazy but</text>
  <text start="512.789" dur="5.29">one could argue that people who are</text>
  <text start="515.02" dur="4.98">content and happy are less motivated you</text>
  <text start="518.079" dur="4.051">know when you&amp;#39;re hungry you&amp;#39;re motivated</text>
  <text start="520" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;ve been both hungry and sated in my</text>
  <text start="522.13" dur="5.28">life and when I was hungry I had more</text>
  <text start="525.25" dur="5.61">motivation and when I was content and</text>
  <text start="527.41" dur="5.4">happy I had less motivation so you</text>
  <text start="530.86" dur="3.96">ever since q it&amp;#39;s been kind of a unique</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="3.78">combination of both I&amp;#39;ve never been more</text>
  <text start="534.82" dur="3.75">motivated but I&amp;#39;ve also never been</text>
  <text start="536.59" dur="4.29">happier and maybe that&amp;#39;s part of that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="538.57" dur="4.14">got to do with being a new dad but um</text>
  <text start="540.88" dur="3.12">you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not necessarily</text>
  <text start="542.71" dur="4.02">typical generally when you&amp;#39;re happy</text>
  <text start="544" dur="5.43">you&amp;#39;re not that driven to go out and</text>
  <text start="546.73" dur="4.59">seek right so maybe that&amp;#39;s just why you</text>
