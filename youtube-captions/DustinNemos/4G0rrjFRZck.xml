  <text start="17.26" dur="4.03">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="19.67" dur="4.53">Deimos and this is your daily maggot</text>
  <text start="21.29" dur="6.78">update so I&amp;#39;m gonna start off with</text>
  <text start="24.2" dur="7.44">culture and Candice Owens so Candice</text>
  <text start="28.07" dur="5.88">Owens is the red pill black youtuber who</text>
  <text start="31.64" dur="5.419">Kanye just made famous when he tweeted</text>
  <text start="33.95" dur="6.18">out how he liked the way she thinks and</text>
  <text start="37.059" dur="5.831">she has now gone on to say that she</text>
  <text start="40.13" dur="7.17">blames Obama for the race relations</text>
  <text start="42.89" dur="6.06">damage so this is gonna send Titanic</text>
  <text start="47.3" dur="3.81">shockwaves through the black community</text>
  <text start="48.95" dur="5.04">who kind of still idolize Obama in many</text>
  <text start="51.11" dur="5.46">ways this is a big deal it&amp;#39;s a cultural</text>
  <text start="53.99" dur="6.42">victory just worth mentioning</text>
  <text start="56.57" dur="5.25">and speaking of cultural victories polls</text>
  <text start="60.41" dur="3.63">are actually showing a decline in</text>
  <text start="61.82" dur="5.49">support for Mueller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="64.04" dur="5.49">among the normies since last summer as</text>
  <text start="67.31" dur="5.489">well the culture war is advancing and we</text>
  <text start="69.53" dur="8.55">are gaining ground and in the deep state</text>
  <text start="72.799" dur="7.411">and political arena one Hilary is</text>
  <text start="78.08" dur="4.02">wearing a back brace you can actually</text>
  <text start="80.21" dur="4.62">clearly see it in a picture that came</text>
  <text start="82.1" dur="5.91">out it&amp;#39;s basically the back kind of</text>
  <text start="84.83" dur="5.43">sticking out like three inches or so and</text>
  <text start="88.01" dur="3.99">she&amp;#39;s very boxy looking and we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="90.26" dur="4.43">video recently where it looked like she</text>
  <text start="92" dur="6.15">was kind of being held up by something</text>
  <text start="94.69" dur="8.65">so definitely a pattern I mean she has a</text>
  <text start="98.15" dur="6.719">clear clear pattern of health issues not</text>
  <text start="103.34" dur="3.959">only from the falling down and the</text>
  <text start="104.869" dur="5.911">broken toes and the broken ankles broken</text>
  <text start="107.299" dur="5.881">or feet and the broken wrists or</text>
  <text start="110.78" dur="5.46">sprained wrist or whatever she&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="113.18" dur="6.33">falling down I think the reason that</text>
  <text start="116.24" dur="6.09">she&amp;#39;s so evil here&amp;#39;s my theory and seems</text>
  <text start="119.51" dur="5.91">to have no fear of what&amp;#39;s going on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.33" dur="5.13">because she&amp;#39;s really dying and McCain is</text>
  <text start="125.42" dur="4.17">kind of similar I mean these are two of</text>
  <text start="127.46" dur="3.69">the loudest voices against Trump but</text>
  <text start="129.59" dur="3.63">they have nothing to lose what can Trump</text>
  <text start="131.15" dur="3.78">really do to them they&amp;#39;re gonna die soon</text>
  <text start="133.22" dur="6.06">anyway so Gitmo doesn&amp;#39;t really scare</text>
  <text start="134.93" dur="5.49">them just my theory completely</text>
  <text start="139.28" dur="3.5">subjective</text>
  <text start="140.42" dur="6.89">you know take it with a grain of salt</text>
  <text start="142.78" dur="6.36">and Trump tweeted out quote the 13 angry</text>
  <text start="147.31" dur="3.78">Democrats in charge of the Russian</text>
  <text start="149.14" dur="4.59">witch-hunt are starting to find out that</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="4.74">there is a court system in place that</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="5.01">actually protects people from injustice</text>
  <text start="155.83" dur="5.37">and just wait till the courts get to see</text>
  <text start="158.74" dur="6.3">your unrevealed conflicts of interest</text>
  <text start="161.2" dur="8.7">end quote so this is kind of a direct</text>
  <text start="165.04" dur="8.97">threat from Trump to Mueller&amp;#39;s anti</text>
  <text start="169.9" dur="6.059">Trump team of 13 and in a kind of</text>
  <text start="174.01" dur="6.54">available way obviously it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="175.959" dur="6.661">not a very overt threat but reveal your</text>
  <text start="180.55" dur="4.92">conflicts of interest so obviously he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.62" dur="4.95">mentioning that he&amp;#39;s gonna he&amp;#39;s gonna go</text>
  <text start="185.47" dur="5.6">there and this is kind of a sign of</text>
  <text start="187.57" dur="8.28">gloves coming off that kind of thing and</text>
  <text start="191.07" dur="9.16">the Gateway Ponton article that came out</text>
  <text start="195.85" dur="6.57">is a perfect almost near-perfect summary</text>
  <text start="200.23" dur="3.99">of that team of 13 and I&amp;#39;m gonna include</text>
  <text start="202.42" dur="4.08">that link below I won&amp;#39;t read it all for</text>
  <text start="204.22" dur="4.19">you guys because it&amp;#39;s a little lengthy</text>
  <text start="206.5" dur="7.019">but it goes through each of them and and</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="7.109">shows the conflict of interest and that</text>
  <text start="213.519" dur="5.671">will be in the links below</text>
  <text start="215.519" dur="6.521">POTUS Trump calls out lovebirds Strock</text>
  <text start="219.19" dur="6.03">and Paige also he&amp;#39;s also kind of tweet</text>
  <text start="222.04" dur="5.52">punching men and he asked why is Peter</text>
  <text start="225.22" dur="5.25">strong still working at the FBI and this</text>
  <text start="227.56" dur="6.649">is right after stronk and the other guy</text>
  <text start="230.47" dur="6.93">just quit but really got fired as well</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="7.271">so not struck at least a page and the</text>
  <text start="237.4" dur="6.29">other guy got fired or according to the</text>
  <text start="241.48" dur="5.88">MSM resigned of course not</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="7.299">according to Q fired and testimony taken</text>
  <text start="247.36" dur="6.09">and being watched and the freedom caucus</text>
  <text start="250.989" dur="4.921">chairman mark meadows okay this is a</text>
  <text start="253.45" dur="4.95">this is interesting he is joining Nunez</text>
  <text start="255.91" dur="3.72">calling for the DOJ officials to be held</text>
  <text start="258.4" dur="5.22">in contempt of Congress this would</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="6.599">include sessions so this is a big voice</text>
  <text start="263.62" dur="4.92">calling for sessions to be held in</text>
  <text start="266.229" dur="6.151">contempt basically and to actually see</text>
  <text start="268.54" dur="5.999">some sort of contempt charges joining</text>
  <text start="272.38" dur="3.28">with Nunez this is two powerful voices</text>
  <text start="274.539" dur="6.251">so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.66" dur="8.46">that&amp;#39;s a great development Trump is</text>
  <text start="280.79" dur="5.73">quote committed to regime change</text>
  <text start="284.12" dur="5.81">end quote in Iran and this is from</text>
  <text start="286.52" dur="8.07">Giuliani he&amp;#39;s basically saying that</text>
  <text start="289.93" dur="6.04">Trump it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s Giuliani&amp;#39;s personal</text>
  <text start="294.59" dur="4.26">opinion that there won&amp;#39;t be any peace</text>
  <text start="295.97" dur="4.2">until the regime has changed in Iran no</text>
  <text start="298.85" dur="4.71">matter what happens between Israel and</text>
  <text start="300.17" dur="6.54">Palestine and I guess he&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="303.56" dur="7.29">implying Trump&amp;#39;s goals and ideas their</text>
  <text start="306.71" dur="6.72">line up with his which has some merit I</text>
  <text start="310.85" dur="4.95">guess and Trump is also planning to</text>
  <text start="313.43" dur="7.62">announce a decision on the Iran deal by</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="8.07">2:00 p.m. Tuesday so tomorrow and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="321.05" dur="4.92">gonna be a big big step toward war war</text>
  <text start="323.87" dur="5.13">maybe or not war or or three I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="325.97" dur="4.62">know we&amp;#39;ll see how it plays out I think</text>
  <text start="329" dur="4.35">he&amp;#39;ll do another North Korea on them</text>
  <text start="330.59" dur="6.63">though just kind of neuter them and</text>
  <text start="333.35" dur="6.36">Israel is threatening Assad president of</text>
  <text start="337.22" dur="4.83">Syria and he&amp;#39;s and they&amp;#39;re saying quote</text>
  <text start="339.71" dur="4.26">if you continue allowing Iran to operate</text>
  <text start="342.05" dur="3.96">out of Syria it will be your end</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="3.72">end quote they&amp;#39;ve also been quoted</text>
  <text start="346.01" dur="4.95">somebody in Israel has been quoted as</text>
  <text start="347.69" dur="5.96">saying we will liquidate him something</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="5.04">along those lines I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing but</text>
  <text start="353.65" dur="4.03">interesting choice it word liquidate</text>
  <text start="356" dur="4.47">kind of makes you wonder what technology</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="7.55">they&amp;#39;re gonna use on him anyway this is</text>
  <text start="360.47" dur="7.71">basically in a threat to assassinate and</text>
  <text start="365.23" dur="5.23">sessions announces a big crackdown on</text>
  <text start="368.18" dur="4.47">illegal immigration there was a big</text>
  <text start="370.46" dur="5.94">speech he basically said he&amp;#39;s doubling</text>
  <text start="372.65" dur="5.82">the capacity of judges to deal with just</text>
  <text start="376.4" dur="3.87">this issue he just assigned like</text>
  <text start="378.47" dur="3.3">30-something new judges that have no</text>
  <text start="380.27" dur="3.48">workloads they&amp;#39;re gonna be full time</text>
  <text start="381.77" dur="4.02">dealing with this issue we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="383.75" dur="4.11">have caravans or anybody else breaking</text>
  <text start="385.79" dur="4.7">our laws coming across the border it was</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="5.7">a good speech there were some hecklers</text>
  <text start="390.49" dur="7.57">but sessions is still sessions so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="393.56" dur="8.52">see a lot is hinging on this this guy</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="6">I have to say that and the assistant</text>
  <text start="402.08" dur="5.49">director of the FBI counterintelligence</text>

  <text start="407.57" dur="3.42">cooperating with the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="409.01" dur="4.11">according to the house permanent Select</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="6.179">Committee on Intelligence member Chris</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="7.019">Stewart and nexium let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="417.169" dur="7.891">nexium nexium come out that the leader</text>
  <text start="420.139" dur="8.25">approves of incest if the victim has an</text>
  <text start="425.06" dur="7.05">orgasm or sexual arousal and gang rape</text>
  <text start="428.389" dur="6.901">if the victim has an orgasm and also</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="7.47">Alison Mac is a Satanist so I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="435.29" dur="7.53">show you an image of Baphomet which was</text>
  <text start="439.58" dur="5.7">zoomed in on from her earrings once that</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="5.61">she wore to some event I don&amp;#39;t know but</text>
  <text start="445.28" dur="4.889">somebody had done them the the program</text>
  <text start="448.43" dur="4.44">worked to just zoom in and get a good</text>
  <text start="450.169" dur="4.921">close image of what her earrings had on</text>
  <text start="452.87" dur="4.859">them so you should be seeing that at</text>
  <text start="455.09" dur="4.02">this point and that&amp;#39;s about it for the</text>
  <text start="457.729" dur="4.771">day there&amp;#39;s a couple things I want to</text>
  <text start="459.11" dur="4.95">mention one remember that although Trump</text>
  <text start="462.5" dur="3.56">has a lot of good stuff with the economy</text>
  <text start="464.06" dur="4.59">we are still in an everything bubble and</text>
  <text start="466.06" dur="5.77">we are still about to deal with some</text>
  <text start="468.65" dur="4.74">major major economic shake ups and Trump</text>
  <text start="471.83" dur="5.27">this is not really gonna be able to stop</text>
  <text start="473.39" dur="7.529">it I think in my opinion so be prepared</text>
  <text start="477.1" dur="5.98">to the SEC is gonna rule if aetherium is</text>
  <text start="480.919" dur="4.951">a security this is a big big deal to</text>
  <text start="483.08" dur="4.92">aetherium coin which is the second</text>
  <text start="485.87" dur="8.1">runner right behind Bitcoin in terms of</text>
  <text start="488" dur="8.13">price and popularity I guess really and</text>
  <text start="493.97" dur="5.069">and in my opinion it&amp;#39;s far superior to</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="6.69">Bitcoin because it&amp;#39;s more useful and</text>
  <text start="499.039" dur="5.401">works better there&amp;#39;s different features</text>
  <text start="502.82" dur="2.94">to these different coins and some of</text>
  <text start="504.44" dur="3.599">them are faster some of them are more</text>
  <text start="505.76" dur="7.17">secure some of the more private things</text>
  <text start="508.039" dur="6.361">like that so aetherium also has many</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="3.349">additional features that are better but</text>
  <text start="514.4" dur="4.889">one of the main ones is smart contracts</text>
  <text start="516.279" dur="6.64">and that allows for an entirely</text>
  <text start="519.289" dur="5.181">different field of useful utility to</text>
  <text start="522.919" dur="5.181">business</text>
  <text start="524.47" dur="5.82">to be allowed which is Bitcoin is just a</text>
  <text start="528.1" dur="7.98">currency basically just you just trade</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="8.82">it that&amp;#39;s it that is it I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="536.08" dur="4.68">that the SEC should be able to rule that</text>
  <text start="539.11" dur="3.56">it says security because security is</text>
  <text start="540.76" dur="5.76">like ownership of a business this is not</text>
  <text start="542.67" dur="5.85">but I think that&amp;#39;s it for the news today</text>
  <text start="546.52" dur="4.59">and I will see you guys around tomorrow</text>
  <text start="548.52" dur="5.32">I&amp;#39;m still working on my furniture but</text>
  <text start="551.11" dur="4.32">hopefully soon I will have something to</text>
  <text start="553.84" dur="4.86">show you guys it&amp;#39;ll be it&amp;#39;ll be pretty</text>
