  <text start="0.39" dur="5.67">good afternoon everyone this is Sydney</text>
  <text start="3.179" dur="4.231">aka the bass southern belle and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6.06" dur="3.18">something very interesting that just</text>
  <text start="7.41" dur="3.39">popped up in the news recently that I</text>
  <text start="9.24" dur="4.319">feel that needs to be discussed because</text>
  <text start="10.8" dur="5.1">this is absolutely monumental in terms</text>
  <text start="13.559" dur="4.861">of something that the right wing needs</text>
  <text start="15.9" dur="4.77">to celebrate and that is that Senator</text>
  <text start="18.42" dur="4.32">Ted Cruz actually sent a letter to the</text>
  <text start="20.67" dur="5.279">Attorney General and to the director of</text>
  <text start="22.74" dur="5.73">the FBI to urge them to investigate an</text>
  <text start="25.949" dur="4.381">Tifa as a domestic terrorist</text>
  <text start="28.47" dur="4.289">organization which is absolutely</text>
  <text start="30.33" dur="5.46">incredible to me that it&amp;#39;s taken this</text>
  <text start="32.759" dur="4.501">long for someone to address this but but</text>
  <text start="35.79" dur="3.78">Ted Cruz actually sent this letter</text>
  <text start="37.26" dur="4.229">urging them to address the issues of</text>
  <text start="39.57" dur="3.509">domestic terrorism and violence in this</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="3.241">country that is being perpetuated in the</text>
  <text start="43.079" dur="3.721">name of social justice and combating</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="4.62">fascism and racism and bigotry and all</text>
  <text start="46.8" dur="4.41">these other asinine terms that the left</text>
  <text start="49.35" dur="3.209">loves to use against conservatives and</text>
  <text start="51.21" dur="3.39">against the right wing in general to</text>
  <text start="52.559" dur="3.541">demonize them simply for expressing</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="3.81">political views that they do not agree</text>
  <text start="56.1" dur="3.63">with this is incredibly significant for</text>
  <text start="58.41" dur="3.51">those of you who have ever attended</text>
  <text start="59.73" dur="4.259">rallies or political events as I have</text>
  <text start="61.92" dur="3.569">and been subject to instances of</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="3.99">domestic terrorism physical intimidation</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="4.981">violence vandalism or anything else at</text>
  <text start="67.979" dur="3.781">the hands of an Tifa black lives matter</text>
  <text start="70.47" dur="4.079">and these other terrorist organizations</text>
  <text start="71.76" dur="5.73">that love to act in the name of this</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="5.07">radicalized ideology of communism in an</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="3.84">attempt to shut down free speech to</text>
  <text start="79.619" dur="3.57">strangle political discourse and the</text>
  <text start="81.33" dur="3.87">silence anyone who disagrees with them</text>
  <text start="83.189" dur="4.141">so this is quite significant because</text>
  <text start="85.2" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s gotten to the point now where we</text>
  <text start="87.33" dur="3.63">have actual governmental officials</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="3">acknowledging this as a problem as it</text>
  <text start="90.96" dur="3.39">should be because these individuals</text>
  <text start="92.07" dur="4.92">claiming to be fighting totalitarianism</text>
  <text start="94.35" dur="4.11">fighting fascism and to be standing in</text>
  <text start="96.99" dur="3.03">the name of social justice and tolerance</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="3.78">and all these other incredibly ironic</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="3.72">terms that they love to use to describe</text>
  <text start="102.24" dur="3.839">their ideology which are not in the</text>
  <text start="103.74" dur="4.05">least accurate because they are the most</text>
  <text start="106.079" dur="3.93">absolutely hateful people imaginable</text>
  <text start="107.79" dur="6.03">this is just incredibly significant</text>
  <text start="110.009" dur="6.871">because we&amp;#39;ve seen so many instances of</text>
  <text start="113.82" dur="4.95">hypocrisy on behalf of antia and the far</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="3.3">left to attempt to justify the use of</text>
  <text start="118.77" dur="2.97">physical intimidation and violence</text>
  <text start="120.18" dur="3.78">against anyone who disagrees with them</text>
  <text start="121.74" dur="3.78">and they accomplish this of course by</text>
  <text start="123.96" dur="3.99">demonizing anyone who disagrees with</text>
  <text start="125.52" dur="5.43">them as a Nazi a bigot a racist of</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="5.64">fascist totalitarian</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="4.86">someone who is intolerant towards others</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="4.56">and yet they engage in such egregious</text>
  <text start="135.81" dur="4.289">actions of domestic terrorism and</text>
  <text start="138.15" dur="3.69">violence against anyone who disagrees</text>
  <text start="140.099" dur="3.991">with them irrespective of what political</text>
  <text start="141.84" dur="4.17">ideology they might pertain to it</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="3.6">doesn&amp;#39;t matter because anyone who</text>
  <text start="146.01" dur="3.69">disagrees with these people will be</text>
  <text start="147.69" dur="4.2">demonized by them and could very well be</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="5.73">attacked by them as we so tragically saw</text>
  <text start="151.89" dur="6.36">last month when a renowned conservative</text>
  <text start="155.43" dur="4.559">under the name of an Dino was viciously</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="3.87">assaulted an attack that ended up in the</text>
  <text start="159.989" dur="3.571">hospital with a potential brain bleed as</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="3.6">a result of being assaulted and attacked</text>
  <text start="163.56" dur="4.17">by an Tifa now the interesting thing</text>
  <text start="165.72" dur="4.44">about this is that an Dino is actually</text>
  <text start="167.73" dur="4.14">not only considered a racial minority in</text>
  <text start="170.16" dur="3.72">terms of him being Asian but he&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="4.229">homosexual these are two demographics</text>
  <text start="173.88" dur="4.05">that the left loves to pretend that they</text>
  <text start="176.099" dur="3.271">want to protect and that are being</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="3.51">systematically oppressed by the right</text>
  <text start="179.37" dur="3.63">wing under the insistence that the right</text>
  <text start="181.44" dur="3">wing and that the conservative and the</text>
  <text start="183" dur="3.06">Republican Party in general are</text>
  <text start="184.44" dur="3.57">intolerant towards those particular</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="4.739">people which is of course an absolute</text>
  <text start="188.01" dur="4.71">lie the interesting thing is that even</text>
  <text start="190.799" dur="3.961">if you pertain to one of those</text>
  <text start="192.72" dur="4.38">demographics the left claims to want to</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="5.43">protect they will in fact treat you just</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="5.4">as intolerant and hatefully as possible</text>
  <text start="200.19" dur="4.5">if you dare deviate from their political</text>
  <text start="202.5" dur="4.53">ideology and frankly it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="204.69" dur="5.22">disgusting to me that an Asian</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="4.56">homosexual was so viciously beaten by</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="3.54">these people upon the basis of a</text>
  <text start="211.59" dur="3.929">political disagreement and yet no one is</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="3.84">really calling out this hypocrisy except</text>
  <text start="215.519" dur="4.021">for those few who are willing to be</text>
  <text start="217.29" dur="4.229">banned for it from social media so this</text>
  <text start="219.54" dur="3.779">is just one of many instances and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="3.451">seen this time and time and time again</text>
  <text start="223.319" dur="3.601">we saw it in Charlottesville in which</text>
  <text start="224.97" dur="3.45">the left instigated a violence and</text>
  <text start="226.92" dur="4.62">terrorism against the right wing and</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="5.25">subsequently got off on that violence</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="4.169">without any legal repercussions to their</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="4.08">actions whatsoever we saw it in Portland</text>
  <text start="235.709" dur="4.711">last month when the actual mayor</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="4.319">defended the actions of an Tifa we see</text>
  <text start="240.42" dur="2.969">it continually when we see these</text>
  <text start="242.069" dur="3.181">congresswoman that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="243.389" dur="4.261">recently criticizing refused to denounce</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="4.53">not only an Tifa but other branches of</text>
  <text start="247.65" dur="4.26">domestic terrorism or foreign terrorism</text>
  <text start="249.78" dur="4.17">like al-qaeda or Isis this is a</text>
  <text start="251.91" dur="4.29">continual problem on the left that they</text>
  <text start="253.95" dur="3.96">not only refused to denounce actions of</text>
  <text start="256.2" dur="4.789">domestic terrorism or organizations</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="6.24">committing those actions but overall</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="3.681">facilitate the capacity for these people</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="2.56">to</text>
  <text start="264.67" dur="4.08">violently attack anyone who disagrees</text>
  <text start="266.71" dur="5.55">with them now of course it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="5.34">matter what ideology you pertain to or</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="5.55">what you believe in necessarily but if</text>
  <text start="274.09" dur="6.36">you dare have the audacity to disagree</text>
  <text start="277.81" dur="4.92">with these people you will inevitably be</text>
  <text start="280.45" dur="4.08">called a fascist and demonized as a</text>
  <text start="282.73" dur="3.81">racist and bigoted and homophobic</text>
  <text start="284.53" dur="3.96">transphobic individual or what other</text>
  <text start="286.54" dur="3.11">terms they can throw at you it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="288.49" dur="3.12">really matter</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="4.36">irrespective of this the fact that this</text>
  <text start="291.61" dur="4.08">is being acknowledged by the federal</text>
  <text start="294.01" dur="2.94">government is incredibly incredibly</text>
  <text start="295.69" dur="2.88">important and I&amp;#39;m very much looking</text>
  <text start="296.95" dur="3.6">forward to seeing how this particular</text>
  <text start="298.57" dur="3.51">story progresses and of course this is</text>
  <text start="300.55" dur="3.39">also why we do what we do in the name of</text>
  <text start="302.08" dur="4.26">free speech because we understand that</text>
  <text start="303.94" dur="4.95">ultimately we must possess the passion</text>
  <text start="306.34" dur="4.08">to defend what we believe in that being</text>
  <text start="308.89" dur="4.32">of course the free exchange of ideas</text>
  <text start="310.42" dur="5.07">civil discourse political conversations</text>
  <text start="313.21" dur="3.75">that should be able to be carried out</text>
  <text start="315.49" dur="5.49">and expressed in a way that does not</text>
  <text start="316.96" dur="7.08">consist of fear in the fears of being</text>
  <text start="320.98" dur="5.1">physically assaulted or subject to</text>
  <text start="324.04" dur="3.33">instances of domestic terrorism on</text>
  <text start="326.08" dur="2.82">behalf of these people simply for</text>
  <text start="327.37" dur="2.91">disagree with them we believe in a free</text>
  <text start="328.9" dur="3.33">country and they don&amp;#39;t and the</text>
  <text start="330.28" dur="4.23">differences they refuse to acknowledge</text>
  <text start="332.23" dur="4.17">the rights that we possess inherently as</text>
  <text start="334.51" dur="3.35">Americans to live in a free country with</text>
  <text start="336.4" dur="4.14">the free exchange of ideas because</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="4">accordingly one possesses the right to</text>
  <text start="340.54" dur="3.98">disagree with them and we simply can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="5.19">have that if they&amp;#39;re trying to establish</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="4.72">communism which is precisely the end</text>
  <text start="347.05" dur="4.11">game of ante feh and these other leftist</text>
  <text start="349.24" dur="3.6">organizations that are pretending to act</text>
  <text start="351.16" dur="3.51">in the name of benevolence of social</text>
  <text start="352.84" dur="5.67">justice and of equality which is nothing</text>
  <text start="354.67" dur="5.4">but a devious lie so we will see how the</text>
  <text start="358.51" dur="3.21">story progresses but this is going to be</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="3.3">quite interesting to see how the federal</text>
  <text start="361.72" dur="3.45">government tackles this issue and</text>
  <text start="363.37" dur="5.93">hopefully indeed we will see something</text>
  <text start="365.17" dur="4.13">come of this in the near future</text>
