  <text start="254.959" dur="3.951">again to clean it up that&amp;#39;s wrong</text>
  <text start="256.58" dur="5.97">I&amp;#39;ve served in combat two tours in Iraq</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="5.92">two thousand four or five and then limit</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="4.86">that Iraq in 2006 seven during these</text>
  <text start="264.83" dur="6.78">surge and then deployed again to</text>
  <text start="267.41" dur="6.36">Afghanistan in 2011-12 so let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="271.61" dur="3.54">about the the IEDs what they what they</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="3.959">are and how they&amp;#39;ve affected our</text>
  <text start="275.15" dur="5.85">soldiers abroad IEDs what we call it an</text>
  <text start="277.729" dur="6.541">improvised the nisshin were used by the</text>
  <text start="281" dur="5.7">insurgents as a guerrilla warfare tactic</text>
  <text start="284.27" dur="5.85">the insurgents in Afghanistan both Iraq</text>
  <text start="286.7" dur="6.9">would use IEDs as a way to demoralize</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="5.49">soldiers their way of fighting the US</text>
  <text start="293.6" dur="4.26">forces the IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="295.61" dur="5.22">were a little different in Iraq these</text>
  <text start="297.86" dur="6.48">IDs were catastrophic meaning we would</text>
  <text start="300.83" dur="4.8">find 200 300 pound IEDs that would</text>
  <text start="304.34" dur="3.96">destroy a military</text>
  <text start="305.63" dur="6.24">vehicle case in point hey Bradley that</text>
  <text start="308.3" dur="6.65">weighs 40 to 50 tons will be demolished</text>
  <text start="311.87" dur="6.24">and by hit by an idea in Afghanistan</text>
  <text start="314.95" dur="4.81">because they don&amp;#39;t have paved roads like</text>
  <text start="318.11" dur="4.91">they have in Iraq the terrain in</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="6.96">Afghanistan are very mountainous and a</text>
  <text start="323.02" dur="6.19">lot of dirt dirt roads so they will use</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="4.5">small IEDs but there might be small but</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="4.56">there won&amp;#39;t be effective because they</text>
  <text start="331.22" dur="6.51">would take legs and limbs of soldiers</text>
  <text start="333.77" dur="8.63">and it was very psychologically</text>
  <text start="337.73" dur="8.07">demoralizing to see a fellow comrade</text>
  <text start="342.4" dur="5.38">minimum patrol step on an AED and hear</text>
  <text start="345.8" dur="3.45">them cry hear them yelling for health</text>
  <text start="347.78" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ve done so many things to try to</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="5.61">intervene this including a robotics that</text>
  <text start="352.28" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re deployed and they may be used</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="3.96">canines yeah right but but then</text>
  <text start="357.2" dur="3.81">Afghanistan they were being smart they</text>
  <text start="358.82" dur="5.91">were using pressure plate ie 20-pound</text>
  <text start="361.01" dur="6.54">pressure it it infuse the IEDs so what</text>
  <text start="364.73" dur="5.58">they did is they change the from IEDs</text>
  <text start="367.55" dur="4.41">made would Ron you can&amp;#39;t dictate them</text>
  <text start="370.31" dur="4.14">with metal detector and as hard on</text>
  <text start="371.96" dur="4.35">system out right we had problems with</text>
  <text start="374.45" dur="3.36">the aluminum parts of the Humvees they</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="2.64">were trying to update those quickly or</text>
  <text start="377.81" dur="2.82">get up to speed and I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="378.95" dur="4.32">much these are homemade weapons cost but</text>
  <text start="380.63" dur="3.99">we were spending beams trying to figure</text>
  <text start="383.27" dur="3.39">out how to combat this isn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="384.62" dur="3.63">correct yes and so they went from you</text>
  <text start="386.66" dur="4.17">know up-armored Humvees to will be</text>
  <text start="388.25" dur="5.07">coming em ramps but by that time the war</text>
  <text start="390.83" dur="4.44">in Iraq was coming to close and whose</text>
  <text start="393.32" dur="6.78">vehicles came a little too late</text>
  <text start="395.27" dur="6.99">in 2004 runs field comes in to Iraq talk</text>
  <text start="400.1" dur="3.87">to soldiers and soldiers were getting</text>
  <text start="402.26" dur="5.37">hit by IEDs they were build their own</text>

  <text start="409.85" dur="4.32">soldier is run fell okay what can you</text>
  <text start="412.19" dur="2.89">provide this protection for us why do we</text>
  <text start="414.17" dur="3.219">soldiers</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="4.589">have to dig through local landfills for</text>
  <text start="417.389" dur="3.84">pieces of scrap metal and compromise</text>
  <text start="419.669" dur="3.12">ballistic glass to up-armored our</text>

  <text start="422.789" dur="10.741">resources readily available to us and</text>
  <text start="431.4" dur="4.229">what was his answer I missed the first</text>
  <text start="433.53" dur="3.87">part of your question our soldiers have</text>
  <text start="435.629" dur="4.711">been fighting in Iraq for coming up on</text>
