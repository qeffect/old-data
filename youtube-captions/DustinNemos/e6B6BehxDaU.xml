  <text start="53.96" dur="4.89">time when I had my head in the sand then</text>
  <text start="56.479" dur="5.091">I found out that power platers past lies</text>
  <text start="58.85" dur="5.22">for truth and truth for the lies</text>

  <text start="93.55" dur="5.56">so working through some of the headlines</text>
  <text start="96.71" dur="4.8">today it seems that Nadler made a</text>
  <text start="99.11" dur="4.44">slip-up now of course we already know</text>
  <text start="101.51" dur="4.56">he&amp;#39;s an anti-trump er and he&amp;#39;s in on the</text>
  <text start="103.55" dur="4.86">impeachment coup but he he basically</text>
  <text start="106.07" dur="4.86">came right out and said why and that is</text>
  <text start="108.41" dur="4.83">a like kind of his AOC moment where he</text>
  <text start="110.93" dur="4.53">sort of had a Freudian slip or something</text>
  <text start="113.24" dur="4.47">in and seems to have admitted that it</text>
  <text start="115.46" dur="4.17">really is about trying to cheat the</text>
  <text start="117.71" dur="4.2">twenty20 election rather than about</text>
  <text start="119.63" dur="3.6">illegitimate impeachment because he says</text>
  <text start="121.91" dur="3.6">something along the lines if the</text>
  <text start="123.23" dur="5.15">president poses a threat to our election</text>
  <text start="125.51" dur="2.87">let&amp;#39;s watch</text>
  <text start="129.289" dur="2.251">I asked you this if he&amp;#39;s acquitted do</text>
  <text start="130.7" dur="5.789">you believe we&amp;#39;ll have a fair election</text>
  <text start="131.54" dur="6.479">in 2020 I don&amp;#39;t know the president based</text>
  <text start="136.489" dur="3.151">on with his past performance will do</text>
  <text start="138.019" dur="3.481">everything he can to make it not a fair</text>
  <text start="139.64" dur="4.29">election and that is part of what gives</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="4.2">us the urgency to proceed with this</text>
  <text start="143.93" dur="3.21">impeachment chairman adler i&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="4.879">leave it there thank you for coming on</text>
  <text start="147.14" dur="3.439">and sharing your views i appreciate you</text>
  <text start="150.58" dur="6.66">so here we have Nadler refusing GOP</text>
  <text start="154.93" dur="5.31">lawmakers right to hold minority hearing</text>
  <text start="157.24" dur="5.82">day now remember that is part of the</text>
  <text start="160.24" dur="4.23">rules that and they even miss changing</text>
  <text start="163.06" dur="4.53">that when they were kind of wrecking the</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="4.83">game against President Trump it&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="3.66">of the rules that the minority party</text>
  <text start="169.3" dur="4.89">still has a day to call their own</text>
  <text start="171.25" dur="4.98">witnesses now this has been refused so</text>
  <text start="174.19" dur="4.2">far and of course they&amp;#39;re playing their</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="4.65">their kind of dirty tricks and and</text>
  <text start="178.39" dur="4.62">that&amp;#39;s why I named this video after the</text>
  <text start="180.88" dur="3.93">game of Thrones because it in a very</text>
  <text start="183.01" dur="6.75">real sense that&amp;#39;s exactly what this is</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="7.02">so let me show you the video here Thank</text>

  <text start="206.17" dur="6.03">and to schedule it at a reasonable time</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="5.31">not after articles have been drawn not</text>

  <text start="244.48" dur="4.05">minority a hearing that point of order</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="4.65">would be timely at a meeting where we</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="4.8">can do such articles it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="251.44" dur="3.96">purpose of today&amp;#39;s hearing and the point</text>

  <text start="470.3" dur="5.61">requirement that the president be a good</text>
  <text start="472.22" dur="5.52">person but that is the hope and it is</text>

  <text start="707.91" dur="6.299">do this questioning pursuant to rule 666</text>
  <text start="711.72" dur="4.979">the House Resolution 661 of the rules of</text>

  <text start="722.179" dur="4.93">unfortunately but not surprisingly</text>
  <text start="724.559" dur="5.01">Lindsey Graham is backtracking on</text>
  <text start="727.109" dur="5.67">previous promises to actually call in</text>
  <text start="729.569" dur="6.18">Schiff as a witness and he says that we</text>
  <text start="732.779" dur="5.06">may not call in witnesses and he wants</text>
  <text start="735.749" dur="4.68">to actually end it as soon as possible</text>
  <text start="737.839" dur="4.631">rather than bringing in witnesses and</text>
  <text start="740.429" dur="4.2">even President Trump I think isn&amp;#39;t kind</text>
  <text start="742.47" dur="3.779">of jokingly made comments that he would</text>
  <text start="744.629" dur="4.56">like to see it happen so that he could</text>
  <text start="746.249" dur="5.971">bring in witnesses and of course Schiff</text>
  <text start="749.189" dur="4.471">himself would be and and the Biden&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="752.22" dur="4.979">would be right up on the chopping block</text>
  <text start="753.66" dur="5.399">there but it&amp;#39;s not really a shock coming</text>
  <text start="757.199" dur="5.31">from Lindsey Graham because of course as</text>
  <text start="759.059" dur="5.58">everybody knows he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s a friend of</text>
  <text start="762.509" dur="4.711">McCain&amp;#39;s former and then you know he&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="764.639" dur="6.65">bit of a traitor himself I would say</text>
  <text start="767.22" dur="7.049">based on his recent actions and and</text>
  <text start="771.289" dur="3.91">maybe he started acting better and acted</text>
  <text start="774.269" dur="3.12">more pro-trump</text>
  <text start="775.199" dur="4.2">after what happened to McCain where</text>
  <text start="777.389" dur="3.66">maybe he was put to death maybe he</text>
  <text start="779.399" dur="3.87">wasn&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t really know the full</text>
  <text start="781.049" dur="4.47">story there you know it was a closed</text>
  <text start="783.269" dur="2.731">casket very confusing funeral it was a</text>
  <text start="785.519" dur="3.511">lot of to</text>
  <text start="786" dur="7.14">tractions going on and and then of</text>
  <text start="789.03" dur="5.67">course they live on CNN they ain&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="793.14" dur="4.29">slipped up and said flip to death about</text>
  <text start="794.7" dur="4.44">him so and then again recently his</text>
  <text start="797.43" dur="4.53">daughter slipped up and said put to</text>
  <text start="799.14" dur="4.56">death or or something similar you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="801.96" dur="4.32">kill my father again something like that</text>
  <text start="803.7" dur="4.14">so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot to it and we</text>
  <text start="806.28" dur="3.96">don&amp;#39;t know where Lindsey Graham&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="807.84" dur="4.95">loyalty lies but we do know that when</text>
  <text start="810.24" dur="6.72">the going gets tough he is really great</text>
  <text start="812.79" dur="6.72">at the talk but he is not that great at</text>
  <text start="816.96" dur="5.82">the action and it makes you wonder how</text>
  <text start="819.51" dur="6.15">many of these treasonous corrupt types</text>
  <text start="822.78" dur="5.22">are his friends right how many of them</text>
  <text start="825.66" dur="4.65">are his former colleagues in corruption</text>
  <text start="828" dur="5.99">he was there with McCain getting the</text>
  <text start="830.31" dur="7.65">order of Ukraine medal who knows right</text>
  <text start="833.99" dur="5.71">so also from the Epoch Times quote if</text>
  <text start="837.96" dur="3.78">you&amp;#39;re a House member and you</text>
  <text start="839.7" dur="4.65">participated you&amp;#39;re not above the law</text>
  <text start="841.74" dur="5.85">but we&amp;#39;re not going to turn the Senate</text>
  <text start="844.35" dur="7.11">into a circus this is from Lindsey</text>
  <text start="847.59" dur="8.76">Graham in reference to trying to call</text>
  <text start="851.46" dur="6.99">Adam Schiff as a witness now that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="856.35" dur="5.21">of it for tonight this is basically the</text>
  <text start="858.45" dur="5.88">the summary of what happened in today&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="861.56" dur="5.74">impeachment fiasco clown show there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="864.33" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s really not much of a difference</text>
  <text start="867.3" dur="4.55">between today and everything else that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="868.98" dur="6.78">happened in the past with these recent</text>

  <text start="887.28" dur="5.309">lifetimes now I think it will fail and</text>
  <text start="891.089" dur="6.411">hopefully it will set a good precedent</text>
  <text start="892.589" dur="7.051">to in you know scare future potential</text>

  <text start="907.05" dur="6.72">they win we are in trouble I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="911.88" dur="4.44">that they will win I&amp;#39;m very positive and</text>
