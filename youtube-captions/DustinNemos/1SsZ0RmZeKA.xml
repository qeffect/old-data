  <text start="333.61" dur="5.91">go one we go wall but with tactical</text>
  <text start="337.38" dur="4.09">decisions you know instead of waiting on</text>

  <text start="362.83" dur="5.48">things to try to help and we can win now</text>

  <text start="423.55" dur="3.179">people are ready for it</text>
  <text start="424.69" dur="3.63">but I think it&amp;#39;s probably gonna wait a</text>
  <text start="426.729" dur="5.031">little bit longer until more of this</text>

  <text start="436.63" dur="3.719">time to digest and be repeated you know</text>
  <text start="438.52" dur="4.17">for a month or so that&amp;#39;s how it works</text>

  <text start="455.289" dur="4.56">obvious when you&amp;#39;re you know kind of</text>
  <text start="458.05" dur="3.989">watching for these things from a trend</text>
  <text start="459.849" dur="3.961">perspective but you know sometimes</text>

  <text start="736.21" dur="5.88">paced it seems but it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="740.65" dur="3.36">interesting topic I don&amp;#39;t know if I</text>
  <text start="742.09" dur="3.45">believe in the Fallen Angels but I know</text>
  <text start="744.01" dur="3.06">that there are people that do believe in</text>
  <text start="745.54" dur="3.78">the Fallen Angels and probably believe</text>
  <text start="747.07" dur="5.73">that they&amp;#39;re descended from them some of</text>
  <text start="749.32" dur="6.98">those folks have established cult-like</text>
  <text start="752.8" dur="5.9">you know secret societies over the ages</text>
  <text start="756.3" dur="4.54">some of them are still in power</text>
  <text start="758.7" dur="3.76">we never did hear anything else about</text>

  <text start="762.46" dur="5.07">found in regards to the Feist abuses and</text>
  <text start="765.04" dur="6.87">you know the FBI talking about secret</text>
  <text start="767.53" dur="6.46">societies and all that did we yeah and</text>
  <text start="771.91" dur="4.66">in McAlester does a great job dig in</text>
  <text start="773.99" dur="5.55">those topics we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve had a couple of</text>
  <text start="776.57" dur="4.44">discussions about that I I love going</text>
  <text start="779.54" dur="4.92">into things like the Book of Enoch it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="781.01" dur="5.25">really fascinating anything that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="784.46" dur="3.09">taken out of something and they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="786.26" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;re not supposed to see this</text>
  <text start="787.55" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;s where I go that&amp;#39;s what I want to</text>
  <text start="790.1" dur="6.63">know why why can&amp;#39;t we see this who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="792.29" dur="12.18">telling us we can&amp;#39;t see it hey you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="796.73" dur="11.94">always good to see you let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="804.47" dur="6.12">I&amp;#39;ll check the queue just a second yeah</text>
  <text start="808.67" dur="3.33">we always want to we always want to just</text>
  <text start="810.59" dur="5.49">my little one we always want to</text>
  <text start="812" dur="6.51">differentiate between Jews and Zionists</text>
  <text start="816.08" dur="5.34">there are anti Zionist Jews and there</text>
  <text start="818.51" dur="5.13">are non-jews I honest and things like</text>
  <text start="821.42" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very confusing issue</text>
  <text start="823.64" dur="4.38">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of factionalism going</text>
  <text start="825.17" dur="9.42">on there what are your thoughts on</text>
  <text start="828.02" dur="9.6">crypto it is a very controlled market</text>
  <text start="834.59" dur="6.54">for the moment and and my my best</text>
  <text start="837.62" dur="6.24">educated guess right now is that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="841.13" dur="6.03">a hotlink faction just waiting until the</text>
  <text start="843.86" dur="5.52">control grid breaks down and when</text>
  <text start="847.16" dur="3.71">there&amp;#39;s a pretty popular atomic swap</text>
  <text start="849.38" dur="4.89">decentralized correct</text>
  <text start="850.87" dur="4.96">exchange option that&amp;#39;ll happen so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="854.27" dur="6.08">not that far away and I think that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="855.83" dur="7.32">governments are scrambling now the Libra</text>
  <text start="860.35" dur="5.28">Facebook&amp;#39;s mention of the Libra the fact</text>
  <text start="863.15" dur="5.55">that the government just shut it down</text>
  <text start="865.63" dur="5.68">shows why you know things like Bitcoin</text>
  <text start="868.7" dur="4.8">are needed because if there&amp;#39;s an Jeff</text>
  <text start="871.31" dur="4.77">Berwick&amp;#39;s may at this point if there are</text>
  <text start="873.5" dur="4.47">offices they will send SWAT teams if</text>
  <text start="876.08" dur="2.43">there are CEOs they will arrest them and</text>
  <text start="877.97" dur="2.82">things like that</text>
  <text start="878.51" dur="6.17">so you can&amp;#39;t actually challenge</text>
  <text start="880.79" dur="6.78">government authority and and monopoly</text>
  <text start="884.68" dur="4.69">which is enforced by violence on a</text>
  <text start="887.57" dur="4.89">currency which is how they control the</text>
  <text start="889.37" dur="4.77">world without decentralization you</text>
  <text start="892.46" dur="3.33">either need black markets with silver</text>
  <text start="894.14" dur="4.74">and gold or you need crypto currencies</text>
  <text start="895.79" dur="4.92">that are honest and trust us based on</text>
  <text start="898.88" dur="2.37">mathematics that everyone can see at all</text>
  <text start="900.71" dur="4.23">times</text>
  <text start="901.25" dur="5.52">so you know I think kryptos are the</text>
  <text start="904.94" dur="2.48">future especially the blockchain I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="906.77" dur="2.66">know</text>
  <text start="907.42" dur="3.5">which of the three thousand-plus cryptos</text>
  <text start="909.43" dur="3.81">are worth it</text>
  <text start="910.92" dur="4.6">bitcoins getting a little bit dated and</text>
  <text start="913.24" dur="4.41">some of the newer stuff is a little bit</text>
  <text start="915.52" dur="6.98">smaller and more vulnerable to attack</text>
  <text start="917.65" dur="6.12">a lot of these things are dishonest</text>
  <text start="922.5" dur="5.41">centralized</text>
  <text start="923.77" dur="6.06">and untrustworthy and some of them are</text>
  <text start="927.91" dur="3.96">not even real crypto currencies they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="929.83" dur="3.71">just digital currencies which is exactly</text>
  <text start="931.87" dur="4.35">what the government would want you on</text>
  <text start="933.54" dur="4.8">which are things you know like the bank</text>
  <text start="936.22" dur="5.58">stir coin reform things of that nature</text>
  <text start="938.34" dur="13.41">so you know I support Kryptos as much</text>
  <text start="941.8" dur="13.53">time as I&amp;#39;m legally allowed to write in</text>
  <text start="951.75" dur="5.62">theory it&amp;#39;s the end of central banks</text>
  <text start="955.33" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s just a little bit of lime kindness</text>
  <text start="957.37" dur="4.68">between the the technology and the</text>
  <text start="959.98" dur="4.92">adoption and all of that and and getting</text>
  <text start="962.05" dur="5.91">to that point unfortunately we have to</text>
  <text start="964.9" dur="5.85">also remember governments are gonna</text>
  <text start="967.96" dur="7.02">fight it to the nail but they&amp;#39;re already</text>
  <text start="970.75" dur="8.01">reacting now I&amp;#39;m still a big gold and</text>
  <text start="974.98" dur="6.78">silver person myself but you know III</text>
  <text start="978.76" dur="5.04">learned my lesson when I when I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="981.76" dur="3.66">buy Bitcoin and I bought a couple ounces</text>
  <text start="983.8" dur="8.91">of silver instead and it was still a few</text>
  <text start="985.42" dur="9.09">pennies each back then all right let me</text>
  <text start="992.71" dur="4.76">get to the queue for a second hang on</text>

  <text start="1034.47" dur="3.66">burning earlier and that&amp;#39;s not anything</text>
  <text start="1036.12" dur="7.319">to do with Bitcoin you know they&amp;#39;re both</text>
  <text start="1038.13" dur="7.38">digital information I guess but you know</text>
  <text start="1043.439" dur="3.87">I&amp;#39;m a fan of the concept of Bitcoin I do</text>
  <text start="1045.51" dur="3.84">think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s largely been</text>

  <text start="2486.45" dur="7.56">can fund a lot of things yeah</text>
  <text start="2491.94" dur="3.51">term limits will term limits are great</text>
  <text start="2494.01" dur="3.09">but they have weaknesses you know that</text>
  <text start="2495.45" dur="7.59">that opens weaknesses as well</text>
  <text start="2497.1" dur="7.53">term limits create problems also yet you</text>
  <text start="2503.04" dur="3.6">get to people in there for too long they</text>
  <text start="2504.63" dur="3.63">become more corrupt to people in they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2506.64" dur="4.86">too short and therefore their focus is</text>
  <text start="2508.26" dur="4.98">more on on short term things they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2511.5" dur="3.87">have the long game at mind and then</text>
  <text start="2513.24" dur="3.81">other people like imposition paying for</text>

  <text start="2520.59" dur="10.77">running circles around us so I think</text>
  <text start="2527.52" dur="6.35">that&amp;#39;s it for the Q there&amp;#39;s a few other</text>
  <text start="2531.36" dur="6.48">things we could definitely talk about</text>

  <text start="2550.53" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t feel bad if you say no I won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2552.3" dur="4.08">offended I don&amp;#39;t make any money either</text>
  <text start="2554.1" dur="3.96">way but how many of you guys would if</text>
  <text start="2556.38" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;re gonna buy health insurance shot</text>
  <text start="2558.06" dur="5.7">through magus rents calm instead of</text>
  <text start="2560.73" dur="5.43">where you&amp;#39;re going now and you can do</text>
  <text start="2563.76" dur="6.56">that for like yeah businesses and things</text>
  <text start="2566.16" dur="4.16">as well or group plans and things</text>
  <text start="2580.63" dur="6.45">and for international stuff you know</text>
  <text start="2582.61" dur="6.42">other things are coming as well I want</text>
  <text start="2587.08" dur="3.21">to get maggot surance rolling out where</text>
  <text start="2589.03" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s actually creating a little bit of</text>
  <text start="2590.29" dur="4.14">funding and then I can take that to</text>
  <text start="2592.33" dur="4.05">people like dr. Andrew Pierzynski and</text>
  <text start="2594.43" dur="3.72">others and I can say look we&amp;#39;re now</text>
  <text start="2596.38" dur="3.75">successful we have some funds coming in</text>
  <text start="2598.15" dur="6.89">where do we go to make this help where</text>
  <text start="2600.13" dur="7.32">do we go to take down pharma with that</text>
  <text start="2605.04" dur="5.17">something with with strong bit burning I</text>
  <text start="2607.45" dur="4.38">think we could do like I said the</text>
  <text start="2610.21" dur="3.69">official white hat for example for stop</text>
  <text start="2611.83" dur="4.56">it burning calm wouldn&amp;#39;t it be cool if</text>
  <text start="2613.9" dur="5.52">we could get like a white hat movement</text>
  <text start="2616.39" dur="5.31">hat kind of a where we go on we go all</text>
  <text start="2619.42" dur="4.05">hats but not queue but just more free</text>
  <text start="2621.7" dur="4.8">speech something everybody can can get</text>
  <text start="2623.47" dur="5.76">behind and agree on it but still where</text>
  <text start="2626.5" dur="5.31">we go one legal wall philosophy behind</text>
  <text start="2629.23" dur="4.38">it what if we can get the white hat</text>
  <text start="2631.81" dur="3.42">everywhere and then they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="2633.61" dur="3.75">make us take it off because I&amp;#39;m like the</text>
  <text start="2635.23" dur="4.41">queue stuff you know it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not Q</text>
  <text start="2637.36" dur="3.93">so we could actually get our white hats</text>
  <text start="2639.64" dur="3.9">into the the rallies and stuff maybe</text>
  <text start="2641.29" dur="3.81">even more than the red hats you know</text>
  <text start="2643.54" dur="2.91">this has happened where we&amp;#39;re even Trump</text>
  <text start="2645.1" dur="5.16">has said there&amp;#39;s a lot of white hats out</text>
  <text start="2646.45" dur="6.3">there you guys remember that if we could</text>
  <text start="2650.26" dur="7.23">do a movement like that and really get</text>
  <text start="2652.75" dur="6.27">eyes on the issue and we could we could</text>
  <text start="2657.49" dur="3.57">maybe take them on not just with a</text>
  <text start="2659.02" dur="5.37">lawsuit but with millions of Patriots</text>
  <text start="2661.06" dur="5.1">behind it that means even if you lose</text>
  <text start="2664.39" dur="2.58">the lawsuit like something else you win</text>
  <text start="2666.16" dur="2.52">down the road</text>
  <text start="2666.97" dur="5.4">one or the other you&amp;#39;re eventually gonna</text>
  <text start="2668.68" dur="8.73">win when you have that much energy</text>
  <text start="2672.37" dur="6.33">behind it so if you guys are here and</text>
  <text start="2677.41" dur="5.09">people get arrested you&amp;#39;ve got to give</text>
  <text start="2678.7" dur="3.8">us some sauce on that like some evidence</text>
  <text start="2687.43" dur="5.99">yeah truth responder says get rid of big</text>
  <text start="2689.74" dur="3.68">pharma lobbyists that would help sure</text>

  <text start="2762.46" dur="5">or do you think it&amp;#39;s purely for money I</text>

  <text start="2767.46" dur="3.22">probably the money and then they would</text>
  <text start="2769.39" dur="5.49">target the areas where there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2770.68" dur="4.62">conservatives just to be dicks because</text>
  <text start="2774.88" dur="2.07">why not</text>
  <text start="2775.3" dur="4.07">two birds with one stone right makes</text>

  <text start="2789.51" dur="4.5">so that that&amp;#39;s cool I appreciate you</text>
  <text start="2791.67" dur="4.53">guys giving me the feedback so my</text>
  <text start="2794.01" dur="3.42">business model with trying to do some of</text>
  <text start="2796.2" dur="2.97">these things like for example the</text>
  <text start="2797.43" dur="3.9">lawsuit since there&amp;#39;s no way I can fund</text>
  <text start="2799.17" dur="4.49">a lawsuit that&amp;#39;s expected to be two</text>
  <text start="2801.33" dur="6.12">hundred thousand dollars before appeals</text>
  <text start="2803.66" dur="6.09">what I was planning to do is bring in</text>
  <text start="2807.45" dur="5.31">Patriot businesses combine that with</text>
  <text start="2809.75" dur="6.16">Patriot audits audiences and Patriot</text>
  <text start="2812.76" dur="5.34">influencers or or truth media whatever</text>
  <text start="2815.91" dur="5.04">you want to call us and those three</text>
  <text start="2818.1" dur="4.44">things together we can fund anything you</text>
  <text start="2820.95" dur="3.87">know we can sell things clearly we have</text>
  <text start="2822.54" dur="4.05">large audiences you know the book was a</text>
  <text start="2824.82" dur="4.289">best-seller you know we can sell things</text>
  <text start="2826.59" dur="5.67">tour we want we don&amp;#39;t want to sell Big</text>
  <text start="2829.109" dur="5.521">Pharma drugs certainly but we can sell</text>
  <text start="2832.26" dur="3.84">pretty much anything so we need to bring</text>
  <text start="2834.63" dur="3.66">in Patriot businesses that will work</text>
  <text start="2836.1" dur="7.14">with us and we can advertise for things</text>
  <text start="2838.29" dur="6.9">like that as far as who if you&amp;#39;re asking</text>
  <text start="2843.24" dur="6.48">about me and I when you&amp;#39;re saying who is</text>
  <text start="2845.19" dur="6.57">he trying to file a lawsuit against it</text>
  <text start="2849.72" dur="4.32">depends my best claim is probably</text>
  <text start="2851.76" dur="4.74">against Google in YouTube because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2854.04" dur="4.319">not as active on Facebook and I&amp;#39;ve only</text>
  <text start="2856.5" dur="5.97">been recently more active on Twitter and</text>
  <text start="2858.359" dur="6.451">things like that but you know there are</text>
  <text start="2862.47" dur="4.47">opportunities for class actions there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2864.81" dur="4.32">opportunities for other people&amp;#39;s cases</text>
  <text start="2866.94" dur="4.2">maybe to be reinforced instead of mine</text>
  <text start="2869.13" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;m willing to do that I would pay for</text>
  <text start="2871.14" dur="6.18">for example maybe a candice owens or a</text>
  <text start="2873.9" dur="5.3">mini AOC or someone like that or maybe</text>
  <text start="2877.32" dur="4.86">like a christian business has been</text>
  <text start="2879.2" dur="4.81">denied marketing for the word christian</text>
  <text start="2882.18" dur="7.56">what muslims not denied things like that</text>
  <text start="2884.01" dur="8.25">so um you know these kind of things</text>
  <text start="2889.74" dur="5.7">could be a stronger case than whatever i</text>
  <text start="2892.26" dur="5.97">have yeah I&amp;#39;m a journalist I&amp;#39;m an author</text>
  <text start="2895.44" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;ve been centered from day one yes I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2898.23" dur="3.54">lost probably hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="2899.94" dur="3.12">dollars of money that I would have been</text>
  <text start="2901.77" dur="3.69">you know rolling in the dough or</text>
  <text start="2903.06" dur="5.549">whatever but they&amp;#39;ve just never paid</text>
  <text start="2905.46" dur="4.68">people and I got in it right as they</text>
  <text start="2908.609" dur="3.51">were d monetizing people anyway so</text>
  <text start="2910.14" dur="4.38">remember for a long time I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="2912.119" dur="4.351">try to monetize I just I figured they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2914.52" dur="4.589">just D monetize me when I started and</text>
  <text start="2916.47" dur="4.559">then I started and like 90% of it was D</text>
  <text start="2919.109" dur="3.9">monetized I could still get</text>
  <text start="2921.029" dur="3.96">a little bit of it sometimes and I would</text>
  <text start="2923.009" dur="3.891">have to for a long time they play the</text>
  <text start="2924.989" dur="4.44">game where everything&amp;#39;s automatically</text>
  <text start="2926.9" dur="4.359">set to D monetize but you have to appeal</text>
  <text start="2929.429" dur="3.78">it and then you have to wait for like a</text>
  <text start="2931.259" dur="4.85">day and then everything&amp;#39;s old and people</text>
  <text start="2933.209" dur="5.191">have already watched it but you know</text>
  <text start="2936.109" dur="3.46">these are the games that they play which</text>
  <text start="2938.4" dur="3.299">is why we have to create other</text>
  <text start="2939.569" dur="4.89">businesses and have sponsors and things</text>
  <text start="2941.699" dur="6.35">like that you know shadow banning D</text>
  <text start="2944.459" dur="13.2">boosting all of that algorithm changes</text>
  <text start="2948.049" dur="10.51">all of it if drugs legalized would you</text>
  <text start="2957.659" dur="3.36">sell it</text>
  <text start="2958.559" dur="5.31">probably not Roberto I just think it&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2961.019" dur="4.53">be bad for branding but I actually in</text>
  <text start="2963.869" dur="2.79">and I say this system buddy whose family</text>
  <text start="2965.549" dur="2.88">was destroyed by drugs</text>
  <text start="2966.659" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m all for them to be legalized because</text>
  <text start="2968.429" dur="3.48">it will destroy the entire profit</text>
  <text start="2970.049" dur="4.17">centers it will destroy the cartels and</text>
  <text start="2971.909" dur="4.2">it will destroy that&amp;#39;s that sort of</text>
  <text start="2974.219" dur="5.25">taboo thing that makes it cool for kids</text>
  <text start="2976.109" dur="5.1">to get into it and we&amp;#39;ve seen some some</text>
  <text start="2979.469" dur="4.23">evidence that societies that legalize</text>
  <text start="2981.209" dur="3.72">actually go down in use so I&amp;#39;m for that</text>
  <text start="2983.699" dur="5.13">because I think that would get us the</text>
