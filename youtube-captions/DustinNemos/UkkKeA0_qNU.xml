  <text start="201.07" dur="4.11">audience and and I feel like there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="4.14">chance to have a useful debate where the</text>
  <text start="205.18" dur="3.69">audience can then be educated and I can</text>
  <text start="207.43" dur="2.85">get through to some of them then I will</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="5.429">do a debate because I feel like it would</text>
  <text start="210.28" dur="6.06">be useful but at this point it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="214.299" dur="4.081">five or six them you know they all say</text>
