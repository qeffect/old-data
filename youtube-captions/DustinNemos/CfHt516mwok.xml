  <text start="8.25" dur="7.559">talk about why I am still for queuing on</text>
  <text start="11.82" dur="6.299">despite the fallout between the qa9 half</text>
  <text start="15.809" dur="4.291">of the or portion or whatever amount of</text>
  <text start="18.119" dur="8.58">the truth community and the alex jones</text>
  <text start="20.1" dur="7.89">Infowars from foresee portion so i said</text>
  <text start="26.699" dur="3">from the beginning i was gonna kind of</text>
  <text start="27.99" dur="3.209">wait with the smudge principle or</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="3.331">whatever the fog principle whatever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="3.511">called in and just wait and see what</text>
  <text start="33.03" dur="3.9">happens before i made a decision i</text>
  <text start="34.71" dur="4.169">wanted to see if cue was going to</text>
  <text start="36.93" dur="4.89">somehow verifying himself with trump</text>
  <text start="38.879" dur="7.231">again in a relatively strong way in a</text>
  <text start="41.82" dur="7.98">short time frame as i expected of course</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="5.49">he was wrong so of course he was wrong</text>
  <text start="49.8" dur="3.39">cue has been verified multiple times</text>
  <text start="51.6" dur="4.979">since then by Trump there&amp;#39;s the fire</text>
  <text start="53.19" dur="5.79">truck situation things like that so all</text>
  <text start="56.579" dur="4.381">of the coincidences the queue incidents</text>
  <text start="58.98" dur="4.739">is something like that while all of that</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="5.19">is still in play</text>
  <text start="63.719" dur="4.501">q and on is no more compromise than</text>
  <text start="66.15" dur="4.68">anything else but he&amp;#39;s calling people</text>
  <text start="68.22" dur="5.009">out they may be they may not be I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="70.83" dur="5.539">know I don&amp;#39;t agree with the way he did</text>
  <text start="73.229" dur="6.271">it necessarily because he mentioned the</text>
  <text start="76.369" dur="5.68">performance artist thing as a jab at</text>
  <text start="79.5" dur="4.17">Alex Jones which you know I&amp;#39;ve debunked</text>
  <text start="82.049" dur="5.011">the performance artists argument over</text>
  <text start="83.67" dur="5.82">and over again you know using satire in</text>
  <text start="87.06" dur="9.18">your show does not then make you act or</text>
  <text start="89.49" dur="8.309">your entire show basically so with that</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="3.69">said the evidence still being very</text>
  <text start="97.799" dur="4.471">strong in Q favor you know I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="4.56">longtime fan of Alex Jones you know 15</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="4.8">years now I&amp;#39;m basically you know a big</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="6.85">portion of my truth</text>
  <text start="107.07" dur="5.98">education came from Alex Jones and you</text>
  <text start="111.34" dur="3.57">know the reason I didn&amp;#39;t do fluoride the</text>
  <text start="113.05" dur="4.23">reason I didn&amp;#39;t do vaccines all kinds of</text>
  <text start="114.91" dur="3.78">stuff came from them so Alex has done</text>
  <text start="117.28" dur="4.14">has been a force for good in the world</text>
  <text start="118.69" dur="4.14">whether or not he&amp;#39;s a shill or a disinfo</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="4.59">agent or whatever he&amp;#39;s been a force for</text>
  <text start="122.83" dur="5.19">good so he has some some respect and</text>
  <text start="126.01" dur="4.62">credibility I do think he&amp;#39;s lying about</text>
  <text start="128.02" dur="5.28">having spoken to Q though okay cuz I</text>
  <text start="130.63" dur="7.59">trust Trump the most out of everybody</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="6.439">and Trump is obviously with gusto that</text>
  <text start="138.22" dur="5.61">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that Trump hates Jones</text>
  <text start="139.739" dur="6.101">whatever but it means that we got a job</text>
  <text start="143.83" dur="5.46">to do and we can&amp;#39;t have people taking</text>
  <text start="145.84" dur="5.16">over the message that&amp;#39;s how I see it</text>
  <text start="149.29" dur="5.16">I don&amp;#39;t always agree with everything</text>
  <text start="151" dur="5.04">that Alex Jo Jones does he&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="3.87">out of way of saying it that rubs some</text>
  <text start="156.04" dur="2.79">people wrong but overall I still think</text>
  <text start="158.32" dur="4.11">he&amp;#39;s a good guy</text>
  <text start="158.83" dur="7.14">I just AM on Team Trump not team and</text>
  <text start="162.43" dur="6.54">force in this particular situation so</text>
  <text start="165.97" dur="4.71">that said that&amp;#39;s my take on it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="4.019">obviously a lot of hatred coming in and</text>
  <text start="170.68" dur="4.11">I mentioned this before but you know we</text>
  <text start="172.989" dur="3.901">should still all have sort of the same</text>
  <text start="174.79" dur="4.229">values and principles and everything we</text>
  <text start="176.89" dur="4.58">still all want to see pedo gate justice</text>
  <text start="179.019" dur="6.211">we still all support Trump we still all</text>
  <text start="181.47" dur="5.769">or more or less conservative you know we</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="5.88">have all this in common there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="187.239" dur="6">anger and hatred and ridicule directed</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="3.77">at people for Q right now and that just</text>
  <text start="193.239" dur="3.451">seems to be something more than</text>
  <text start="194.88" dur="4.27">disagreements from within the community</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="5.34">about you know Alex Jones versus Q and</text>
  <text start="199.15" dur="4.699">on so just my opinions take it with a</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="3.86">grain of salt</text>
