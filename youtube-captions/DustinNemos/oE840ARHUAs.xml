  <text start="14.429" dur="2.85">I&amp;#39;m a little bit behind on the economy</text>
  <text start="15.929" dur="3.751">but I know that things are getting</text>
  <text start="17.279" dur="4.051">really tense I know that trends are kind</text>
  <text start="19.68" dur="4.17">of coming to fruition we&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="21.33" dur="5.93">about Bitcoin gold silver everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="23.85" dur="5.429">going weird I know brexit is sort of</text>
  <text start="27.26" dur="4.179">culminating and there&amp;#39;s a lot of big</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="3.751">political uh people everything with</text>
  <text start="31.439" dur="3.96">Trump in the US I mean there&amp;#39;s so much</text>

  <text start="40.16" dur="4.66">absolutely and you know I&amp;#39;m gonna this</text>
  <text start="43.11" dur="4.44">morning I was listening to an interview</text>
  <text start="44.82" dur="8.85">of Christine Lagarde the head of the IMF</text>
  <text start="47.55" dur="8.37">on CNBC and she made quite a few points</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="5.9">how seventy percent of the global</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="8.099">economy is slowing including the u.s.</text>
  <text start="59.57" dur="6.82">seventy percent then the next segment</text>
  <text start="64.019" dur="4.621">not Christine Lagarde but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="4.92">talking to Larry Kudlow and about</text>
  <text start="68.64" dur="5.07">President Trump how strong the economy</text>
  <text start="71.31" dur="4.98">is how much the global economy is</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="5.67">growing but the truth of the matter is</text>
  <text start="76.29" dur="5.939">is what they&amp;#39;re doing is just covering</text>
  <text start="79.38" dur="4.559">up the problems and what people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="82.229" dur="5.661">like to hear but it&amp;#39;s simply the truth</text>
  <text start="83.939" dur="7.051">is they can do it until they can&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="87.89" dur="5.26">the economy on a global basis and I</text>
  <text start="90.99" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t care really where you look I mean</text>
  <text start="93.15" dur="6.21">look that China&amp;#39;s bond market is now</text>
  <text start="96" dur="6.75">entering a new ETS yes right not going</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="5.73">to do pardon it&amp;#39;s all bad yeah great and</text>
  <text start="102.75" dur="5.369">that&amp;#39;s just about supporting that market</text>
  <text start="105.09" dur="6.27">and making it appear that everything is</text>
  <text start="108.119" dur="6.091">okay and nobody&amp;#39;s talking about the</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="6.93">looming shift on the I Boers</text>
  <text start="114.21" dur="8.04">but brexit particularly look the</text>
  <text start="118.29" dur="9.63">population voted in 2016 they postponed</text>
  <text start="122.25" dur="10.43">it for two years they put in a patch for</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="9.14">a year so that the central counterparty</text>
  <text start="132.68" dur="9">so the small group of entities that</text>
  <text start="137.06" dur="8.549">actually stand between the market buyers</text>
  <text start="141.68" dur="6.029">and sellers most of those transactions</text>
  <text start="145.609" dur="4.981">the derivative bet transactions are done</text>
  <text start="147.709" dur="7.68">through the City of London I mean by a</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="7.86">wide margin and with a hard brexit</text>
  <text start="155.389" dur="6.651">meaning that the Great Britain is going</text>
  <text start="158.45" dur="6.83">to leave the European Union without a</text>
  <text start="162.04" dur="6.64">reciprocal financial agreement</text>
  <text start="165.28" dur="7.319">threatened hundreds of trillions of</text>
  <text start="168.68" dur="6.66">dollars worth of derivative transactions</text>
  <text start="172.599" dur="4.78">so of course they wrote in the right of</text>
  <text start="175.34" dur="4.47">the white knight what do they do it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="177.379" dur="4.92">not that they ever change behavior and</text>
  <text start="179.81" dur="5.399">all of that counterparty risk what they</text>
  <text start="182.299" dur="7.83">do is they change the rules they put a</text>
  <text start="185.209" dur="7.411">patch over it so over okay they were</text>
  <text start="190.129" dur="6.39">supposed to leave on March 29th and that</text>
  <text start="192.62" dur="6.449">now got postponed until April 12th and</text>
  <text start="196.519" dur="3.93">it looks like there&amp;#39;s going to be a hard</text>
  <text start="199.069" dur="3.211">brexit which means they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="200.449" dur="6.771">leave the European Union without those</text>
  <text start="202.28" dur="11.28">agreements except that both the US and</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="10.469">the EU agreed with the City of London to</text>
  <text start="213.56" dur="7.98">enable those central counterparties to</text>
  <text start="217.689" dur="7.63">to manage the derivative transactions</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="7.949">like they have been right now for one</text>
  <text start="225.319" dur="8.04">year presuming that that would give them</text>
  <text start="229.489" dur="6.36">enough time to create those or make the</text>
  <text start="233.359" dur="6.12">changes that they need to to Europe and</text>
  <text start="235.849" dur="7.95">keep this whole game going but let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="239.479" dur="7.53">this is in 2019 and what do we have</text>
  <text start="243.799" dur="6.451">coming up I mean the countdown clock is</text>
  <text start="247.009" dur="8.54">ticking to all of those contracts</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="8.459">needing to be that mature after 2021</text>
  <text start="255.549" dur="6.851">needing to be reset the derivative</text>
  <text start="258.709" dur="6.661">contracts are no different and just</text>
  <text start="262.4" dur="3.59">because they put that patch in doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="2.96">mean</text>
  <text start="265.99" dur="6.929">to say that there might not be some</text>
  <text start="268.33" dur="9.059">unintended consequences of all of their</text>
  <text start="272.919" dur="9.331">behavior so and not only that all that</text>
  <text start="277.389" dur="7.56">does is possibly create a patch over the</text>
  <text start="282.25" dur="5.4">financial system well what about the</text>
  <text start="284.949" dur="5.071">rest of the economy and what about the</text>
  <text start="287.65" dur="5.19">population that is living through this</text>
  <text start="290.02" dur="6">nightmare whose standard of living has</text>
  <text start="292.84" dur="6.03">been severely impacted by it so the</text>
  <text start="296.02" dur="4.41">bank&amp;#39;s again skate well we don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="298.87" dur="5.46">know that yet we&amp;#39;ll know better after</text>
  <text start="300.43" dur="7.169">April 12th but but presumably the bank&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="304.33" dur="6.3">skate and the public again eats it on</text>
  <text start="307.599" dur="3.891">the chin and that&amp;#39;s really to that</text>
  <text start="310.63" dur="3.12">movement</text>
  <text start="311.49" dur="3.519">we actually wanted to elaborate on that</text>
  <text start="313.75" dur="3.24">a little bit just for those who aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="315.009" dur="3.75">really aware of what this you know this</text>
  <text start="316.99" dur="4.709">bubble means when this thing really</text>
  <text start="318.759" dur="4.351">shifts and you&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="321.699" dur="3.12">this for a while like they have certain</text>
  <text start="323.11" dur="3.059">plans it&amp;#39;s never been tested before in</text>
  <text start="324.819" dur="3">history there&amp;#39;s no precedents it</text>
  <text start="326.169" dur="3.961">probably won&amp;#39;t work and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="327.819" dur="3.961">incompetent and corrupt so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="330.13" dur="4.319">of things against us if they did try a</text>
  <text start="331.78" dur="4.83">shift and you know you say patch but</text>
  <text start="334.449" dur="2.97">what comes to mind is band-aid and</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="3.96">bullet wound</text>
  <text start="337.419" dur="5.071">I don&amp;#39;t know me all right so tell me</text>
  <text start="340.57" dur="4.05">just let everybody know just kind of for</text>
  <text start="342.49" dur="4.38">the for the layperson what something</text>
  <text start="344.62" dur="5.13">like that would do immediately to to</text>
  <text start="346.87" dur="6.15">their up standard of living well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="349.75" dur="5.15">kind of back up for just a second to</text>
  <text start="353.02" dur="5.16">because I think it&amp;#39;s good to clarify it</text>
  <text start="354.9" dur="5.009">you know the population 52% of the</text>
  <text start="358.18" dur="4.919">population in Great Britain</text>
  <text start="359.909" dur="5.98">voted for Great Britain to leave the</text>
  <text start="363.099" dur="5.69">European Union now they didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="365.889" dur="6.361">same currency they never used the Euro</text>
  <text start="368.789" dur="7.18">however all of the governance and the</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="6.979">ability to easily travel back and forth</text>
  <text start="375.969" dur="6.45">and for corporations multinational</text>
  <text start="379.229" dur="6.34">corporations to do business in different</text>
  <text start="382.419" dur="6.661">countries means that if you were part of</text>
  <text start="385.569" dur="6.121">that block that was pretty easy to do</text>
  <text start="389.08" dur="4.23">you you there were minimum requirements</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="3.96">that had to be met once you got the</text>
  <text start="393.31" dur="3.419">authorisation one place you had the</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="3.72">authorization</text>
  <text start="396.729" dur="4.951">in 27 countries so for</text>
  <text start="399.37" dur="5.85">corporations especially those that were</text>
  <text start="401.68" dur="7.29">part of Great Britain or or their main</text>
  <text start="405.22" dur="7.29">offices or they&amp;#39;re saved them a lot of</text>
  <text start="408.97" dur="5.37">money but since they since it looks like</text>
  <text start="412.51" dur="5.79">they&amp;#39;re not coming to conclusion on that</text>
  <text start="414.34" dur="6.75">and creating that agreement then what</text>
  <text start="418.3" dur="4.83">that means is that if that&amp;#39;s called pass</text>
  <text start="421.09" dur="4.74">porting the ability to move easily</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="5.55">between those countries well that means</text>
  <text start="425.83" dur="6.51">that particularly anybody in the</text>
  <text start="428.68" dur="7.26">manufacturing sector that imports and a</text>
  <text start="432.34" dur="5.13">lot of the goods are imported from</text>
  <text start="435.94" dur="3.42">Europe well they don&amp;#39;t have those</text>
  <text start="437.47" dur="6.449">agreements anymore so that is like a</text>
  <text start="439.36" dur="8.46">complete disruption now how many of them</text>
  <text start="443.919" dur="7.141">actually moved operations over to the EU</text>
  <text start="447.82" dur="6.96">to avoid that a lot of financial firms</text>
  <text start="451.06" dur="5.82">did up to Ernst &amp;amp; Young pardon</text>
  <text start="454.78" dur="5.91">I imagine they should have if they were</text>
  <text start="456.88" dur="7.5">exactly right 52 percent according to</text>
  <text start="460.69" dur="6.21">Ernst and Young have at least discuss</text>
  <text start="464.38" dur="4.2">moving part of their operations I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="466.9" dur="4.949">it&amp;#39;s much higher than that was in</text>
  <text start="468.58" dur="7.38">January that that number came on and</text>
  <text start="471.849" dur="6.231">they&amp;#39;ve had you know three votes to not</text>
  <text start="475.96" dur="4.98">accept the terms and the withdrawal</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="4.57">agreements so I&amp;#39;m sure that that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="480.94" dur="6.42">right that number is going to be a whole</text>
  <text start="482.65" dur="7.47">lot higher but the problem is they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="487.36" dur="5.76">been stockpiling grocery stores</text>
  <text start="490.12" dur="5.01">governments have been stockpiling food</text>
  <text start="493.12" dur="3.96">because most of the food is imported</text>
  <text start="495.13" dur="4.56">from Europe that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="497.08" dur="5.94">disruptive they&amp;#39;ve been stockpiling</text>
  <text start="499.69" dur="6.509">medicine but we also know that the real</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="7.11">estate market in England is on the</text>
  <text start="506.199" dur="5.97">downside and you know a lot of jobs even</text>
  <text start="510.13" dur="5.039">with all of those firms that are moving</text>
  <text start="512.169" dur="5.351">to the EU well they&amp;#39;re taking all those</text>
  <text start="515.169" dur="4.661">jobs with</text>
  <text start="517.52" dur="5.25">those jobs are coming back so easy yeah</text>
  <text start="519.83" dur="4.95">yeah I&amp;#39;m even actually on I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="522.77" dur="4.02">start a couple of side things that are</text>
  <text start="524.78" dur="3.78">like low startup is insisted in case</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="3.66">they ban mean and censor me and</text>
  <text start="528.56" dur="4.8">completely shut us down as journalists</text>
  <text start="530.45" dur="4.86">on YouTube and I&amp;#39;m looking into robotics</text>
  <text start="533.36" dur="3.78">and it&amp;#39;s actually you can get a robotic</text>
  <text start="535.31" dur="3.6">arm and do work and actually replace the</text>
  <text start="537.14" dur="3.57">employee in some cases very affordably</text>
  <text start="538.91" dur="4.44">now like it&amp;#39;s just going to happen</text>
  <text start="540.71" dur="6.3">because it makes sense right well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="543.35" dur="5.55">why they anticipate that and with it I</text>
  <text start="547.01" dur="5.13">think it&amp;#39;s within 10 years or something</text>
  <text start="548.9" dur="6.03">like that 50 the robotics will take over</text>
  <text start="552.14" dur="6.06">50 percent of the current workforce I</text>
  <text start="554.93" dur="6.27">think felt we&amp;#39;re like $4,000 I can</text>
  <text start="558.2" dur="6.06">replace my wife full-time job with a</text>
  <text start="561.2" dur="6.36">robot think about that so that means</text>
  <text start="564.26" dur="5.16">that shoes that have that job unless she</text>
  <text start="567.56" dur="2.88">cut and she you got to be creative I</text>
  <text start="569.42" dur="3.06">mean you&amp;#39;ve got to look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.44" dur="6.03">happening so that you can develop the</text>
  <text start="572.48" dur="6.84">skill sets for the future which i think</text>
  <text start="576.47" dur="5.76">is much harder you know in your age</text>
  <text start="579.32" dur="5.34">group in my age group you know I&amp;#39;m 64</text>
  <text start="582.23" dur="4.05">already doesn&amp;#39;t matter that much</text>
  <text start="584.66" dur="5">although lord knows I&amp;#39;ve reinvented</text>
  <text start="586.28" dur="6.72">myself a whole bunch of times but today</text>
  <text start="589.66" dur="5.2">you have to be able to have you have to</text>
  <text start="593" dur="3.81">reinvent yourself I think I read</text>
  <text start="594.86" dur="6.87">somewhere don&amp;#39;t hold me to this wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="596.81" dur="7.38">18 new jobs or it&amp;#39;s already economy yeah</text>
  <text start="601.73" dur="4.08">every day people my age are supposedly</text>
  <text start="604.19" dur="3.84">supposed to have like five or six</text>
  <text start="605.81" dur="3.78">different different gigs that that way</text>
  <text start="608.03" dur="5.19">they can bring in and honest full time</text>
  <text start="609.59" dur="6.24">sort of self employment income and and</text>
  <text start="613.22" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;ve been through that I&amp;#39;m sort of more</text>
  <text start="615.83" dur="4.74">focused on one or two now and I&amp;#39;m kind</text>
  <text start="618.38" dur="3.96">of pursuing passions more than anything</text>
  <text start="620.57" dur="5.91">and that that&amp;#39;s kind of been my business</text>
  <text start="622.34" dur="6">model but sorry but no no that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="626.48" dur="6.17">because the point that you&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="628.34" dur="8.46">making is that we all have to take more</text>
  <text start="632.65" dur="7.48">responsibility for ourselves and our</text>
  <text start="636.8" dur="5.91">income because if we&amp;#39;re counting on the</text>
  <text start="640.13" dur="5.79">government or the corporations to do it</text>
  <text start="642.71" dur="5.94">then we are going to starve I mean quite</text>
  <text start="645.92" dur="4.78">honestly that&amp;#39;s why they want the</text>
  <text start="648.65" dur="6.15">sharing economy and the gig</text>
  <text start="650.7" dur="8.43">economy but who&amp;#39;s owning the robotic arm</text>
  <text start="654.8" dur="5.86">okay and then not an individual that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="659.13" dur="4.53">counting on somebody to give them a job</text>
  <text start="660.66" dur="5.7">and not everybody is entrepreneurial not</text>
  <text start="663.66" dur="8.22">everybody has that kind of mindset to</text>
  <text start="666.36" dur="6.9">see gee pardon sorry it&amp;#39;s so hard to</text>
  <text start="671.88" dur="4.53">find those people that you mentioned</text>
  <text start="673.26" dur="4.86">entrepreneurial people yeah well and you</text>
  <text start="676.41" dur="2.28">know a lot of what&amp;#39;s happening right now</text>
  <text start="678.12" dur="4.41">too</text>

  <text start="814.56" dur="5.04">end of the day this is a con game it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.26" dur="6.33">all about confidence and confidence in</text>

  <text start="855.26" dur="4.69">that&amp;#39;s maybe you&amp;#39;re having that issue as</text>
  <text start="857.97" dur="4.23">well who do you think as far as the</text>
  <text start="859.95" dur="3.54">economic sense you know they have some</text>
  <text start="862.2" dur="3.12">of the right as far as I understand the</text>
  <text start="863.49" dur="3.39">passions in the right place and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="865.32" dur="3.06">sorry to jump topics but you brought</text>
  <text start="866.88" dur="3.12">that to mind and the yellow vests just</text>
  <text start="868.38" dur="3.24">stood out to me immediately because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="870" dur="4.11">heard some of the arguments and it seems</text>
  <text start="871.62" dur="3.96">to be the sentiments right but they</text>
  <text start="874.11" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t have a lot of the economic</text>
  <text start="875.58" dur="6.27">foundation that and that&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="878.82" dur="7.29">and that&amp;#39;s and that&amp;#39;s why at least at</text>
  <text start="881.85" dur="8.07">this point they can continue to remain</text>
  <text start="886.11" dur="6.48">in power the elite but they are quaking</text>
  <text start="889.92" dur="4.95">in their boots because this next crisis</text>
  <text start="892.59" dur="4.41">guess what everybody&amp;#39;s going to know how</text>
  <text start="894.87" dur="3.96">everything was false and there and</text>
  <text start="897" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s not that much confidence out</text>
  <text start="898.83" dur="6.18">there I mean there is ridiculous</text>
  <text start="901.29" dur="5.49">consumer confidence okay because they</text>
  <text start="905.01" dur="4.86">got a little raise which still isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="906.78" dur="6.66">keeping pace with inflation but hey it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="909.87" dur="6.33">better than nothing yeah but at this</text>
  <text start="913.44" dur="3.99">point you&amp;#39;re throwing scraps and people</text>
  <text start="916.2" dur="2.51">are still hungry because there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="917.43" dur="4.14">enough me</text>
  <text start="918.71" dur="5.47">you mentioned hungry and meat so I know</text>
  <text start="921.57" dur="4.17">another sort of pet passion of yours is</text>
  <text start="924.18" dur="3.84">raising your own food and being</text>
  <text start="925.74" dur="4.32">sustainable and having a sense of</text>
  <text start="928.02" dur="3.96">community and such I don&amp;#39;t want to jump</text>
  <text start="930.06" dur="3.63">off of the economics actually want to go</text>
  <text start="931.98" dur="3.03">and talk about like the alternative to</text>
  <text start="933.69" dur="2.28">Swift that&amp;#39;s coming and some of the</text>
  <text start="935.01" dur="3">other things that are happening right</text>
  <text start="935.97" dur="4.35">now as well if you don&amp;#39;t mind but you</text>
  <text start="938.01" dur="3.66">know how are things going with your your</text>
  <text start="940.32" dur="3.24">food raising and then what do you have</text>
  <text start="941.67" dur="4.32">for people that are curious about</text>
  <text start="943.56" dur="6.15">getting into it maybe don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="945.99" dur="6.3">maybe they&amp;#39;re nervous well first of all</text>
  <text start="949.71" dur="4.5">don&amp;#39;t be nervous because you gotta kiss</text>
  <text start="952.29" dur="4.11">a lot of frogs before you find a prince</text>
  <text start="954.21" dur="5.31">meaning that you&amp;#39;re gonna kill a lot of</text>
  <text start="956.4" dur="5.22">plants before you figure it out so but</text>
  <text start="959.52" dur="3.84">anything that you put attention to</text>
  <text start="961.62" dur="5.01">really thrives</text>
  <text start="963.36" dur="6.57">so if I needed to I would say honestly</text>
  <text start="966.63" dur="6.57">at this point 90% of my food comes from</text>
  <text start="969.93" dur="5.46">my farm but it would be pretty easy for</text>
  <text start="973.2" dur="5.79">me to do a hundred percent if I needed</text>
  <text start="975.39" dur="6.33">to and I&amp;#39;m really producing a lot of</text>
  <text start="978.99" dur="5.97">food right now finally it&amp;#39;s taken I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="981.72" dur="5.46">been working on it since 2010 and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="984.96" dur="4.95">taken this long I&amp;#39;ve killed a lot of</text>
  <text start="987.18" dur="6.36">plants a lot little a lot of trees you</text>
  <text start="989.91" dur="5.94">know along the way but I&amp;#39;m now I I</text>
  <text start="993.54" dur="6.51">believe that the farm is now at a point</text>
  <text start="995.85" dur="6.27">where we can really share a lot more of</text>
  <text start="1000.05" dur="3.87">the food with the community we make a</text>
  <text start="1002.12" dur="3.18">ton of friends and stuff and have like</text>
  <text start="1003.92" dur="3.27">all these cool events and you could</text>
  <text start="1005.3" dur="5.43">probably have like harvest dinners and</text>
  <text start="1007.19" dur="8.01">things I could but I&amp;#39;m really actually</text>
  <text start="1010.73" dur="6.57">looking to along with that kind of thing</text>
  <text start="1015.2" dur="4.14">I just recently did the intent canto</text>
  <text start="1017.3" dur="2.94">tour we had like 2,000 people come</text>
  <text start="1019.34" dur="5.57">through is crazy</text>
  <text start="1020.24" dur="8.76">Wow but you know I also would like to</text>
  <text start="1024.91" dur="8.92">attach and I&amp;#39;m looking to attach to a</text>
  <text start="1029" dur="7.709">local something to do with kids because</text>
  <text start="1033.83" dur="5.04">I really don&amp;#39;t like it I&amp;#39;ll ever go to</text>
  <text start="1036.709" dur="4.861">bed hungry period end of discussion</text>
  <text start="1038.87" dur="5.58">this rude young man oh man that&amp;#39;d be so</text>
  <text start="1041.57" dur="4.71">cool I&amp;#39;ve got some dreams I want to do</text>
  <text start="1044.45" dur="3.9">in that area as well more I was thinking</text>
  <text start="1046.28" dur="3.96">more educational trying to help children</text>
  <text start="1048.35" dur="3.89">kind of break out of the looking the</text>
  <text start="1050.24" dur="4.89">marks this mind control but</text>
  <text start="1052.24" dur="5.2">absolutely no this is all part of it</text>
  <text start="1055.13" dur="4.56">right I mean I didn&amp;#39;t I was not a</text>
  <text start="1057.44" dur="5.58">gardener when I started the urban farm</text>
  <text start="1059.69" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;m telling you if I needed to garden a</text>
  <text start="1063.02" dur="4.05">little bit I&amp;#39;d go to my sister who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1064.88" dur="5.13">master gardener and I&amp;#39;d help her out you</text>
  <text start="1067.07" dur="5.04">know I was not a gardener I really</text>
  <text start="1070.01" dur="4.71">didn&amp;#39;t know anything at all</text>
  <text start="1072.11" dur="4.95">but you always no matter what need to be</text>
  <text start="1074.72" dur="4.89">as sustainable as possible so going into</text>
  <text start="1077.06" dur="5.13">schools of course I&amp;#39;ve got my grin my</text>
  <text start="1079.61" dur="4.77">grandchildren and my grandson is in</text>
  <text start="1082.19" dur="3.72">kindergarten so I recently did this</text>
  <text start="1084.38" dur="3.72">thing with all the different eggs that</text>
  <text start="1085.91" dur="5.31">we produce the duck eggs the quail eggs</text>
  <text start="1088.1" dur="5.94">the different color chicken eggs so</text>
  <text start="1091.22" dur="5.7">you&amp;#39;re right education is really</text>
  <text start="1094.04" dur="6">critical what I love is how much more</text>
  <text start="1096.92" dur="7.23">attention is being paid to the quality</text>
  <text start="1100.04" dur="5.91">of the food you know instead of all of</text>
  <text start="1104.15" dur="4.91">the additives but you&amp;#39;re right it is</text>
  <text start="1105.95" dur="7.17">education but it&amp;#39;s all about being as</text>
  <text start="1109.06" dur="7.96">independent and self-sufficient as you</text>
  <text start="1113.12" dur="4.2">can and then sharing whatever that may</text>
  <text start="1117.02" dur="3.15">be</text>
  <text start="1117.32" dur="4.77">whether you&amp;#39;re financially savvy like we</text>
  <text start="1120.17" dur="3.96">were talking about and understanding the</text>
  <text start="1122.09" dur="4.8">economy which is why did the farm to</text>
  <text start="1124.13" dur="3.81">begin with I think that&amp;#39;s the same thing</text>
  <text start="1126.89" dur="3.09">you&amp;#39;re doing there I give out free</text>
  <text start="1127.94" dur="4.05">trials of my carbon 60 product to people</text>
  <text start="1129.98" dur="3.9">that are sick and I&amp;#39;m only able to do</text>
  <text start="1131.99" dur="3.33">that as expensive I have thousands of</text>
  <text start="1133.88" dur="3.15">dollars worth of free trials come in</text>
  <text start="1135.32" dur="3.27">this month I can only do that because of</text>
  <text start="1137.03" dur="3.21">people supporting and then paying for</text>
  <text start="1138.59" dur="4.17">products and such as capitalism it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1140.24" dur="3.36">win-win it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a dirty thing that</text>
  <text start="1142.76" dur="3.42">they make it out to be</text>
  <text start="1143.6" dur="4.71">do you mind if I shift over and ask</text>
  <text start="1146.18" dur="3.72">about like I know Russia and others are</text>
  <text start="1148.31" dur="3">setting up the alternative to the Swift</text>
  <text start="1149.9" dur="4.14">system I don&amp;#39;t know where we are on that</text>
  <text start="1151.31" dur="5.58">I know kind of everybody&amp;#39;s jumping off</text>
  <text start="1154.04" dur="4.5">of the dollar train the petro dollar and</text>
  <text start="1156.89" dur="2.67">that&amp;#39;s that has huge implications we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1158.54" dur="3.03">talked about that a little bit before</text>
  <text start="1159.56" dur="5.67">but maybe you could give us an update on</text>
  <text start="1161.57" dur="6.24">those issues well I would really have to</text>
  <text start="1165.23" dur="5.49">look what what we see is that Russia and</text>
  <text start="1167.81" dur="6.03">China and actually globally the central</text>
  <text start="1170.72" dur="5.13">banks gobbling up a lot of gold to put</text>
  <text start="1173.84" dur="3.93">in their reserves because they know the</text>
  <text start="1175.85" dur="4.53">other garbage that they&amp;#39;re buying and</text>
  <text start="1177.77" dur="7.02">their reserves they know what that is</text>
  <text start="1180.38" dur="8.27">yeah but I can also I can also tell you</text>
  <text start="1184.79" dur="7.65">that there&amp;#39;s so much debt globally</text>
  <text start="1188.65" dur="8.29">denominated in u.s. dollars that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1192.44" dur="8.16">seeing this major rally in the dollar</text>
  <text start="1196.94" dur="6.36">versus the other currencies the problem</text>
  <text start="1200.6" dur="5.22">with that because of the demand so every</text>
  <text start="1203.3" dur="4.77">time the dollar starts to pull back we</text>
  <text start="1205.82" dur="5.22">see a rally in it not because it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="1208.07" dur="5.64">wonderful but because these foreign</text>
  <text start="1211.04" dur="6.93">these foreign entities that do not earn</text>
  <text start="1213.71" dur="7.5">dollars but issued debt in terms of</text>
  <text start="1217.97" dur="6.96">dollars mean those dollars to pay that</text>
  <text start="1221.21" dur="5.82">debt having said that the higher the</text>
  <text start="1224.93" dur="6.72">dollar is in relation to their currency</text>
  <text start="1227.03" dur="7.38">the more expensive that is which puts us</text>
  <text start="1231.65" dur="4.46">all in jeopardy of a massive debt</text>
  <text start="1234.41" dur="4.68">default Lobley</text>
  <text start="1236.11" dur="6.25">including China which is now their bond</text>
  <text start="1239.09" dur="5.88">market which is now you know entered</text>
  <text start="1242.36" dur="4.59">into a brand-new whenever they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1244.97" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;ve done with it an index a new</text>
  <text start="1246.95" dur="7.83">index sure to support it this is part of</text>
  <text start="1251.15" dur="5.19">the patch so while on the one hand the</text>

  <text start="1261.68" dur="8.85">flight from the dollar what makes it</text>
  <text start="1266.03" dur="8.16">what covers it up and hides that is the</text>
  <text start="1270.53" dur="6.84">global meeting of those dollars to pay</text>
  <text start="1274.19" dur="6.39">the debt that they issued in terms of</text>
  <text start="1277.37" dur="6.6">dollars which puts another layer of risk</text>
  <text start="1280.58" dur="5.46">on the whole thing so are they do they</text>
  <text start="1283.97" dur="4.23">want that alternative and is there</text>
  <text start="1286.04" dur="5.4">already an alternative to the petro</text>

  <text start="1387.5" dur="6.72">the rest of the confidence where are we</text>

  <text start="1394.22" dur="5.73">silver market we&amp;#39;re building out that</text>
  <text start="1396.71" dur="5.939">cup formation which is an accumulation</text>
  <text start="1399.95" dur="6.839">pattern and an indication that the smart</text>

  <text start="1408.919" dur="5.37">to know about it yeah so it does have a</text>
  <text start="1411.74" dur="6.63">ways to come to conclusion on the cup</text>
  <text start="1414.289" dur="6.451">but I would bet in silver and gold&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1418.37" dur="4.73">case that we will definitely see that</text>
  <text start="1420.74" dur="6.12">this year that we could probably</text>
  <text start="1423.1" dur="5.409">possibly even see it by the second or</text>
  <text start="1426.86" dur="4.679">third quarter and we&amp;#39;re just entering</text>
  <text start="1428.509" dur="5.13">you know the the second quarter so I</text>
  <text start="1431.539" dur="6.6">think that we&amp;#39;re very very close in that</text>
  <text start="1433.639" dur="7.62">because what we&amp;#39;re also witnessing even</text>
  <text start="1438.139" dur="6.24">as the stock markets are probably about</text>
  <text start="1441.259" dur="6.931">to make new highs because of all of the</text>
  <text start="1444.379" dur="5.911">easy money policy we&amp;#39;re also seeing this</text>
  <text start="1448.19" dur="6.99">rush of</text>
  <text start="1450.29" dur="9.12">you stock issues the unicorns are coming</text>
  <text start="1455.18" dur="6.6">to roost and wait it&amp;#39;s more than 85% of</text>

  <text start="1461.78" dur="5.91">a credible means to show when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1464.81" dur="4.71">gonna be profitable which is kind of</text>
  <text start="1467.69" dur="6.17">interesting to me when you look at these</text>
  <text start="1469.52" dur="7.11">businesses know like less hype edges</text>
  <text start="1473.86" dur="4.45">yeah they&amp;#39;re doing really badly yeah and</text>
  <text start="1476.63" dur="3.36">it&amp;#39;s all hype it&amp;#39;s all hype in many</text>
  <text start="1478.31" dur="2.64">cases like they don&amp;#39;t have to even have</text>
  <text start="1479.99" dur="4.46">cash flow at all</text>
  <text start="1480.95" dur="8.1">right because every investor that</text>
  <text start="1484.45" dur="7.93">investor every gambler that comes in and</text>
  <text start="1489.05" dur="6">buy shares pays a higher price puts a</text>
  <text start="1492.38" dur="5.67">bunch of money in it and that is how</text>
  <text start="1495.05" dur="5.34">they determine what the valuation is and</text>
  <text start="1498.05" dur="4.8">then when it comes out look at all those</text>
  <text start="1500.39" dur="4.71">people that now had access to the</text>
  <text start="1502.85" dur="5.01">markets and you had what a 30 percent</text>
  <text start="1505.1" dur="4.56">pop on the stock of the first day of</text>
  <text start="1507.86" dur="3.84">issue something like that 20 or 30</text>
  <text start="1509.66" dur="4.95">percent something like that always good</text>
  <text start="1511.7" dur="5.19">to consider the fundamentals before you</text>
  <text start="1514.61" dur="3.69">know yeah at least at the very least</text>
  <text start="1516.89" dur="3.3">because they&amp;#39;ll always tell you stuff</text>
  <text start="1518.3" dur="5.55">like this so you don&amp;#39;t make too bad at</text>
  <text start="1520.19" dur="5.76">home estate yeah I ask like is there a</text>
  <text start="1523.85" dur="3.87">way and I have some good tech friends is</text>
  <text start="1525.95" dur="4.68">there a way that we could track in real</text>
  <text start="1527.72" dur="4.95">time with like an automated system all</text>
  <text start="1530.63" dur="4.26">of the data about silver and kind of</text>
  <text start="1532.67" dur="5.22">where it said on total supply and where</text>
  <text start="1534.89" dur="4.2">that is in terms of who&amp;#39;s supporting how</text>
  <text start="1537.89" dur="3.48">much is warded how much is still</text>
  <text start="1539.09" dur="4.05">available maybe we could kind of figure</text>
  <text start="1541.37" dur="3.96">out a supply demand and see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1543.14" dur="3.84">available above I know I know we&amp;#39;re sort</text>
  <text start="1545.33" dur="5.04">of I think we&amp;#39;re using a fashion line it</text>
  <text start="1546.98" dur="5.01">right now right I&amp;#39;m sorry what I said I</text>
  <text start="1550.37" dur="4.77">think we&amp;#39;re using it faster than we can</text>
  <text start="1551.99" dur="6.18">mine it at the moment not only are we</text>
  <text start="1555.14" dur="6.51">using it faster than we combined it but</text>
  <text start="1558.17" dur="6.18">they&amp;#39;re selling future production I</text>
  <text start="1561.65" dur="3.99">think the last time I saw it so correct</text>
  <text start="1564.35" dur="3.21">me if I&amp;#39;m wrong because I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1565.64" dur="3.78">where it is right at this moment but I</text>
  <text start="1567.56" dur="5.04">think wasn&amp;#39;t it they had sold something</text>
  <text start="1569.42" dur="6.78">like two hundred and fifty three days</text>
  <text start="1572.6" dur="6.29">worth of production forward right so</text>
  <text start="1576.2" dur="5.97">this is silver that still has to be mom</text>
  <text start="1578.89" dur="5.5">right and with energy costs going up now</text>
  <text start="1582.17" dur="5.94">silver happens to be a byproduct</text>
  <text start="1584.39" dur="5.879">so it&amp;#39;s not quite the same issue around</text>
  <text start="1588.11" dur="4.83">the energy prices going up but quite</text>
  <text start="1590.269" dur="5.431">honestly that has an impact on it and</text>
  <text start="1592.94" dur="5.28">you&amp;#39;re getting to the point where the</text>
  <text start="1595.7" dur="4.68">price is suppressed below the cost of</text>
  <text start="1598.22" dur="5.189">mining guess what they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1600.38" dur="5.639">sell I gotta sell you silver that costs</text>
  <text start="1603.409" dur="6.421">them more to produce to people out of</text>
  <text start="1606.019" dur="4.38">the ground and to refine then it cost</text>
  <text start="1609.83" dur="2.939">them</text>
  <text start="1610.399" dur="3.481">you&amp;#39;re gonna lose silver supply when I</text>
  <text start="1612.769" dur="2.671">was younger I used to dream about</text>
  <text start="1613.88" dur="3.179">instead of like how can I get the most</text>
  <text start="1615.44" dur="3.839">silver for the best deal and I was</text>
  <text start="1617.059" dur="4.62">thinking maybe if I just bought land</text>
  <text start="1619.279" dur="4.38">that is known to have silver and I just</text>
  <text start="1621.679" dur="3.96">sit on it for a hundred years build like</text>
  <text start="1623.659" dur="4.201">a homestead and raise some kids and</text>
  <text start="1625.639" dur="4.591">animals and stuff by then it may be</text>
  <text start="1627.86" dur="6.12">worth it to start mining but I would own</text>
  <text start="1630.23" dur="6.27">it might be interesting well you know it</text>
  <text start="1633.98" dur="5.34">is very interesting because what you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1636.5" dur="6.33">actually brought up is one of the legs</text>
  <text start="1639.32" dur="5.729">of the stool of dynastic wealth now</text>
  <text start="1642.83" dur="5.189">dynastic wealth is wealth at last some</text>
  <text start="1645.049" dur="7.97">families at least 300 years and it has</text>
  <text start="1648.019" dur="7.29">three legs it has real estate rare</text>
  <text start="1653.019" dur="4.27">collectibles not because the Franklin</text>
  <text start="1655.309" dur="6.691">Mint says it but because the world says</text>
  <text start="1657.289" dur="8.041">it and both okay gold you could actually</text>
  <text start="1662" dur="5.7">do all three of them in there so if you</text>
  <text start="1665.33" dur="5.37">did a metals mine whether it&amp;#39;s silver or</text>
  <text start="1667.7" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s gold that is one of the legs of</text>
  <text start="1670.7" dur="5.099">dynastic wealth you talk about holding</text>
  <text start="1673.22" dur="4.079">on to it for a hundred years well yeah</text>
  <text start="1675.799" dur="4.38">dynastic wealth you&amp;#39;re going to pass</text>
  <text start="1677.299" dur="5.97">down from generation to generation and</text>
  <text start="1680.179" dur="7.71">it&amp;#39;s the kind of wealth that survives</text>
  <text start="1683.269" dur="9.27">regime shifts currency crisis wars all</text>
  <text start="1687.889" dur="6.721">of that that&amp;#39;s true dynastic wealth so</text>
  <text start="1692.539" dur="4.951">when you look at the Queen of England</text>
  <text start="1694.61" dur="7.22">that&amp;#39;s dynastic wealth and we have that</text>
  <text start="1697.49" dur="7.74">opportunity coming up to actually build</text>
  <text start="1701.83" dur="6.52">that kind of wealth because if that</text>
  <text start="1705.23" dur="7.26">silver mine is owned on land that is</text>
  <text start="1708.35" dur="6.569">leveraged or they have not prepared for</text>
  <text start="1712.49" dur="5.6">the property taxes that are going to</text>
  <text start="1714.919" dur="6.311">ensue when we hit hyperinflation</text>
  <text start="1718.09" dur="6.83">guess what&amp;#39;s coming back on the market</text>
  <text start="1721.23" dur="6.88">and what happens is all that fiat money</text>
  <text start="1724.92" dur="5.89">inflation gets burned out of it it goes</text>
  <text start="1728.11" dur="4.98">down to its fundamental value it&amp;#39;ll most</text>
  <text start="1730.81" dur="4.05">likely go below that because that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1733.09" dur="4.56">always what happened it&amp;#39;s always an</text>
  <text start="1734.86" dur="5.54">overreaction and if you understand the</text>
  <text start="1737.65" dur="8.04">fundamentals as you pointed out earlier</text>
  <text start="1740.4" dur="7.18">and you see that cup formation where you</text>
  <text start="1745.69" dur="5.97">now know the smartest guys in the room</text>
  <text start="1747.58" dur="6.57">are actually accumulating even if you</text>
  <text start="1751.66" dur="5.79">don&amp;#39;t understand anything else but you</text>
  <text start="1754.15" dur="5.58">learn to recognize those patterns you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1757.45" dur="4.23">in a much better position to make an</text>
  <text start="1759.73" dur="6.18">educated choice that&amp;#39;s going to benefit</text>
  <text start="1761.68" dur="6.36">you and build that dynastic wealth for</text>
  <text start="1765.91" dur="4.29">now it&amp;#39;s still a dream but one day I</text>
  <text start="1768.04" dur="4.2">figured I would basically raise animals</text>
  <text start="1770.2" dur="3.9">or something anything I want I try to</text>
  <text start="1772.24" dur="4.62">make it pay for itself so I do kind of</text>
  <text start="1774.1" dur="4.86">like a gig or small business and I want</text>
  <text start="1776.86" dur="5.28">to have you know like grass-fed organic</text>
  <text start="1778.96" dur="4.74">happy beef towels and various animals I</text>
  <text start="1782.14" dur="3.09">want to be sustainable and have all of</text>
  <text start="1783.7" dur="3.42">that stuff in case things do get really</text>
  <text start="1785.23" dur="4.2">bad and now we just had a million acres</text>
  <text start="1787.12" dur="3.99">that wiped out with a flood so the price</text>
  <text start="1789.43" dur="4.83">of beef was about to skyrocket</text>
  <text start="1791.11" dur="4.77">I&amp;#39;m sure nationwide and I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1794.26" dur="5.37">having some similar issues with food and</text>
  <text start="1795.88" dur="5.4">you mentioned with the UK and so</text>
  <text start="1799.63" dur="3.21">worldwide and food prices are probably</text>
  <text start="1801.28" dur="3.33">going to be going up as well that seems</text>
  <text start="1802.84" dur="4.02">like a place to be in terms of business</text>
  <text start="1804.61" dur="4.22">I&amp;#39;d love to lock down some land and</text>
  <text start="1806.86" dur="4.32">start a farm business that&amp;#39;d be so fun</text>
  <text start="1808.83" dur="4.72">well the real estate market has</text>
  <text start="1811.18" dur="5.76">definitely peaked and it&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="1813.55" dur="6.75">over that peak so with a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1816.94" dur="6.17">patience I&amp;#39;m pretty sure you&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="1820.3" dur="6.05">able to do that now having said that</text>
  <text start="1823.11" dur="5.62">because I get this question a lot anyway</text>
  <text start="1826.35" dur="4.93">people that that want to buy real estate</text>
  <text start="1828.73" dur="6.09">well you have to have a place to make</text>
  <text start="1831.28" dur="6.69">your last stand and so you make that</text>
  <text start="1834.82" dur="5.76">choice even if you know that at the this</text>
  <text start="1837.97" dur="7.26">juncture you would be overpaying for it</text>
  <text start="1840.58" dur="6.03">if you need a place to live then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1845.23" dur="2.91">not really overpaying because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1846.61" dur="4.09">going to create your food and your</text>
  <text start="1848.14" dur="5.289">energy and your security and</text>
  <text start="1850.7" dur="4.53">and your barter ability from this</text>
  <text start="1853.429" dur="5.641">property yeah you can use property to</text>
  <text start="1855.23" dur="7.019">make wealth for sure exactly but having</text>
  <text start="1859.07" dur="6.469">said that property taxes even if you own</text>
  <text start="1862.249" dur="6.331">it outright is one of the biggest issues</text>
  <text start="1865.539" dur="7.57">about real estate and that a lot is</text>
  <text start="1868.58" dur="6.719">where the gold comes in right because</text>
  <text start="1873.109" dur="4.2">we&amp;#39;ve what we&amp;#39;ve seen and it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="1875.299" dur="5.88">happens all the time so this is just a</text>
  <text start="1877.309" dur="7.23">fact that overtime gold will keep pace</text>
  <text start="1881.179" dur="7.86">with those property taxes so that you</text>
  <text start="1884.539" dur="6.151">can always pay them yeah yeah okay if</text>
  <text start="1889.039" dur="3.39">you can&amp;#39;t your goal or any other living</text>
  <text start="1890.69" dur="2.459">expense really big is also gonna</text>
  <text start="1892.429" dur="3.33">skyrocket</text>
  <text start="1893.149" dur="5.551">basically it&amp;#39;s yes and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1895.759" dur="4.951">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really for me that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1898.7" dur="5.299">really what silver is about I mean it</text>
  <text start="1900.71" dur="6.179">depends on what I&amp;#39;m looking at but</text>
  <text start="1903.999" dur="5.591">absolutely you need a combination of the</text>
  <text start="1906.889" dur="3.331">two I like depends on what I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="1909.59" dur="2.429">accomplish</text>
  <text start="1910.22" dur="5.519">guys silver bar right in front of me</text>
  <text start="1912.019" dur="6.84">well know you&amp;#39;ve probably got a cool</text>
  <text start="1915.739" dur="8">silver or two around oh I have one or</text>
  <text start="1918.859" dur="7.95">two yeah so I need to say this because I</text>
  <text start="1923.739" dur="5.861">hold them in a private vault yes of</text>
  <text start="1926.809" dur="3.75">course I do not hold them as close to me</text>
  <text start="1929.6" dur="3.899">as I once did</text>
  <text start="1930.559" dur="4.98">if anybody and this is funny because I</text>
  <text start="1933.499" dur="3.81">used actually and this is a little scary</text>
  <text start="1935.539" dur="3.57">I use this more for packaging and stuff</text>
  <text start="1937.309" dur="4.921">but I had so many death threats I carry</text>
  <text start="1939.109" dur="5.07">this on me and all that and if you want</text>
  <text start="1942.23" dur="3.419">to rob me for this there&amp;#39;s this in front</text>
  <text start="1944.179" dur="3.36">of it but there&amp;#39;s really not that much</text>
  <text start="1945.649" dur="5.49">silver in my house either so although I</text>
  <text start="1947.539" dur="5.52">don&amp;#39;t have a private vault well I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1951.139" dur="4.41">own the vault yeah yeah of course you</text>
  <text start="1953.059" dur="5.46">know but in the vault</text>
  <text start="1955.549" dur="4.921">are you walking distance for me are you</text>
  <text start="1958.519" dur="4.081">ever concerned and that&amp;#39;s cool if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1960.47" dur="4.559">in walking distance but everybody has me</text>
  <text start="1962.6" dur="3.959">if things get really bad that it would</text>
  <text start="1965.029" dur="4.26">be the vault guards that get your money</text>
  <text start="1966.559" dur="5.791">and not not you know it&amp;#39;s kind of an</text>
  <text start="1969.289" dur="5.52">argument himself sometimes you know</text>
  <text start="1972.35" dur="4.23">actually in a private vault if it was a</text>
  <text start="1974.809" dur="5.401">bank vault the answer would be yes for</text>
  <text start="1976.58" dur="5.909">sure if the private vault especially the</text>
  <text start="1980.21" dur="4.13">one here I&amp;#39;m in Phoenix so there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="1982.489" dur="4.941">different private vaults that I know</text>
  <text start="1984.34" dur="4.59">of the answer&amp;#39;s no because they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1987.43" dur="4.47">really know what&amp;#39;s in there it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1988.93" dur="5.34">really about that and you have there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1991.9" dur="4.35">really limited access and I think they</text>
  <text start="1994.27" dur="4.08">need both keys they can&amp;#39;t get in without</text>
  <text start="1996.25" dur="4.17">both keys if people if people could use</text>
  <text start="1998.35" dur="3.51">their gold as a debit card I think we</text>
  <text start="2000.42" dur="3.06">would solve a lot of problems right</text>
  <text start="2001.86" dur="4.79">there make it convenient for people and</text>
  <text start="2003.48" dur="6">easy I think that&amp;#39;s the biggest thing</text>
  <text start="2006.65" dur="5.56">well you know the function of gold is to</text>
  <text start="2009.48" dur="4.41">hold its value and hold the the value of</text>
  <text start="2012.21" dur="5.06">your work because that&amp;#39;s what you</text>
  <text start="2013.89" dur="7.08">convert into money to live on overtime</text>
  <text start="2017.27" dur="5.86">so you know I definitely do think that</text>
  <text start="2020.97" dur="3.78">gold needs to be you need to become your</text>
  <text start="2023.13" dur="6.15">own banker and you need to be your own</text>
  <text start="2024.75" dur="7.38">central banker but for me that&amp;#39;s more of</text>
  <text start="2029.28" dur="5.97">a long-term hold a debit card is a</text>
  <text start="2032.13" dur="5.88">day-to-day purchase I&amp;#39;m considering how</text>
  <text start="2035.25" dur="8.13">much manipulation the central banks do</text>
  <text start="2038.01" dur="5.97">on it with gold because obviously gold</text>
  <text start="2043.38" dur="3.42">is money</text>
  <text start="2043.98" dur="4.83">the Fiat is the other side a rising gold</text>
  <text start="2046.8" dur="3.87">price is an indication of a failing</text>
  <text start="2048.81" dur="4.8">currency I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="2050.67" dur="6.09">and the noise that&amp;#39;s not done that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2053.61" dur="8.31">okay but until they&amp;#39;re ready for the</text>
  <text start="2056.76" dur="6.99">full reset so so after that then yes</text>
  <text start="2061.92" dur="3.87">that would make a whole lot of sense and</text>
  <text start="2063.75" dur="4.02">and you probably will see that and you</text>
  <text start="2065.79" dur="4.41">are seeing some of that now in the</text>
  <text start="2067.77" dur="4.52">crypto currencies I think thoughts I</text>
  <text start="2070.2" dur="4.38">know we differ on this I kind of do see</text>
  <text start="2072.29" dur="4.15">the thing with crypto is is so many</text>
  <text start="2074.58" dur="4.44">scams out there and there&amp;#39;s so many like</text>
  <text start="2076.44" dur="4.29">there&amp;#39;s so much and and even the</text>
  <text start="2079.02" dur="3.24">exchanges and such but if you get the</text>
  <text start="2080.73" dur="3.93">right one I feel like it really could be</text>
  <text start="2082.26" dur="5.15">a free market alternative to online</text>
  <text start="2084.66" dur="5.49">commerce I still think gold and silver</text>
  <text start="2087.41" dur="4.42">particularly Silver&amp;#39;s is better for for</text>
  <text start="2090.15" dur="4.68">sort of long-term storage I like to be</text>
  <text start="2091.83" dur="5.37">able to bury something but you know</text>
  <text start="2094.83" dur="4.56">we&amp;#39;re not really that far off on that</text>
  <text start="2097.2" dur="3.69">and it&amp;#39;s okay if we don&amp;#39;t agree on a</text>
  <text start="2099.39" dur="3.66">hundred percent of anything anyway</text>
  <text start="2100.89" dur="4.59">because that&amp;#39;s what we need to hear they</text>
  <text start="2103.05" dur="6.24">need to hear that discussion and I</text>
  <text start="2105.48" dur="5.79">definitely see a place for crypto</text>
  <text start="2109.29" dur="4.77">currencies because boy you can make</text>
  <text start="2111.27" dur="5.16">transactions like that with the physical</text>
  <text start="2114.06" dur="3.69">metals you still have to liquidate it</text>
  <text start="2116.43" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s easy</text>
  <text start="2117.75" dur="5.78">enough to do but it takes time maybe</text>
  <text start="2119.85" dur="7.17">have to ship it etc so for the barnable</text>
  <text start="2123.53" dur="7.03">transactions yes I can absolutely see a</text>
  <text start="2127.02" dur="5.4">place for it I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="2130.56" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s as invisible as a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2132.42" dur="4.74">think it is and obviously we&amp;#39;re there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2135.3" dur="4.41">talk about all the manipulation and the</text>
  <text start="2137.16" dur="6.21">price of Bitcoin and blah blah blah</text>
  <text start="2139.71" dur="7.5">so there&amp;#39;s a lot of bugs that have to be</text>
  <text start="2143.37" dur="8.13">worked out and kinks but if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2147.21" dur="6.45">intangible short-term I&amp;#39;m good long-term</text>
  <text start="2151.5" dur="5.85">I&amp;#39;ll trust it because if you don&amp;#39;t hold</text>
  <text start="2153.66" dur="5.43">it you don&amp;#39;t own it agreed for sure I</text>
  <text start="2157.35" dur="3.33">mean a homeowner party risk is too much</text>
  <text start="2159.09" dur="3.39">for me all right well thank you so much</text>
  <text start="2160.68" dur="3.42">lean that is have we covered everything</text>
  <text start="2162.48" dur="3.36">that&amp;#39;s like the major stuff right now I</text>
  <text start="2164.1" dur="6.15">think we hit everything that was on my</text>
  <text start="2165.84" dur="8.25">list there&amp;#39;s so much going on right now</text>
  <text start="2170.25" dur="6.72">that it&amp;#39;s a very interesting time to be</text>
  <text start="2174.09" dur="5.22">in these you know paying attention to</text>
  <text start="2176.97" dur="4.23">these markets and history we are living</text>
  <text start="2179.31" dur="4.08">through history yeah we truly are</text>
  <text start="2181.2" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s so cool to know you and thank you</text>
  <text start="2183.39" dur="2.4">once again for your time and I</text>

  <text start="2190.83" dur="3.36">want them to make sure they can find</text>
  <text start="2192.15" dur="4.44">UiTM trading on YouTube at 19 trading</text>
  <text start="2194.19" dur="6.33">comm right yes and what we really</text>
  <text start="2196.59" dur="8.22">specialize in is the physical monetary</text>
  <text start="2200.52" dur="7.5">metals so both silver and gold but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2204.81" dur="5.91">been studying currencies since 1987 and</text>
  <text start="2208.02" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;m all about patterns then her people</text>
  <text start="2210.72" dur="3.66">okay which is probably earlier than you</text>
  <text start="2212.58" dur="4.92">were born I was more than 87 actually</text>
  <text start="2214.38" dur="7.77">perfectly so I&amp;#39;m not in a few days I</text>
  <text start="2217.5" dur="8.04">will be 32 oh happy birthday but you</text>
  <text start="2222.15" dur="5.58">know I mean what I saw were repeatable</text>
  <text start="2225.54" dur="4.35">patterns and I just did a piece and</text>
  <text start="2227.73" dur="4.71">maybe Megan I&amp;#39;ll send you the link on it</text>
  <text start="2229.89" dur="5.67">on currency pegs and that breaking down</text>
  <text start="2232.44" dur="6.06">and the currency life cycle because what</text>
  <text start="2235.56" dur="6.45">we&amp;#39;re really experiencing is the same</text>
  <text start="2238.5" dur="6.69">thing that we&amp;#39;ve experienced over 4800</text>
  <text start="2242.01" dur="6.33">times historically and what we&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="2245.19" dur="6.32">what I did was create a strategy for</text>
  <text start="2248.34" dur="6.08">myself based upon those repeat</text>
  <text start="2251.51" dur="7.02">patterns that has actually become the</text>
  <text start="2254.42" dur="6.57">blueprint for what we do here at i-10 so</text>
  <text start="2258.53" dur="6.5">what we like to do is to work with</text>
  <text start="2260.99" dur="7.08">people based on their goals and</text>
  <text start="2265.03" dur="6.19">developing a portfolio that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="2268.07" dur="5.22">help them you know thrive through this</text>
  <text start="2271.22" dur="5.01">not just survive it but certainly that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2273.29" dur="5.069">a big key but also thrive through this</text>
  <text start="2276.23" dur="5.7">so the other side of this mess you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2278.359" dur="5.341">actually better off than you were when</text>
  <text start="2281.93" dur="4.49">you started the mess yeah I think</text>
  <text start="2283.7" dur="5.85">there&amp;#39;s a lot to be made here for sure</text>
  <text start="2286.42" dur="5.23">tremendous and it&amp;#39;s always in buying low</text>
  <text start="2289.55" dur="4.59">and selling high so you got to know how</text>
  <text start="2291.65" dur="4.89">to recognize that undervalued asset and</text>
  <text start="2294.14" dur="4.53">you have to have the patience for the</text>
  <text start="2296.54" dur="4.95">rest of the market - or in the case of</text>
  <text start="2298.67" dur="5.79">gold for the central bankers to be ready</text>
  <text start="2301.49" dur="5.46">to reset the currencies and this is</text>
  <text start="2304.46" dur="4.409">global so this is going to be bigger</text>
  <text start="2306.95" dur="4.05">than anything we&amp;#39;ve ever seen in our</text>
  <text start="2308.869" dur="4.771">lifetime and and our children definitely</text>
  <text start="2311" dur="6">I don&amp;#39;t know how many generations down</text>
  <text start="2313.64" dur="6.9">the road before they see this again but</text>
  <text start="2317" dur="6.33">this is our opportunity to put the</text>
  <text start="2320.54" dur="6.87">generations ahead of us like my children</text>
  <text start="2323.33" dur="6.63">my grandchildren their children in much</text>
  <text start="2327.41" dur="5.64">in this big economy in this Sharri</text>
  <text start="2329.96" dur="5.88">economy let them be here so that they</text>
  <text start="2333.05" dur="4.95">have choices exactly that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2335.84" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s all about for us it&amp;#39;s the privilege</text>
