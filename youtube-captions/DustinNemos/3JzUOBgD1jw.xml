  <text start="1.1" dur="5.32">welcome back my friends this is Dustin</text>
  <text start="4.17" dur="4.29">an Athena Nemo&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s joining me again</text>
  <text start="6.42" dur="4.32">today because she got fussy in the swing</text>
  <text start="8.46" dur="4.29">and I just want to go through a couple</text>
  <text start="10.74" dur="4.68">things in the news today one</text>
  <text start="12.75" dur="5.55">interestingly the House passes a bill</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="4.83">allowing reciprocity with a concealed</text>
  <text start="18.3" dur="3.72">carry so that means you would be able to</text>
  <text start="20.25" dur="3.75">take it across state lines you&amp;#39;d be able</text>
  <text start="22.02" dur="3.749">to use your concealed carry anywhere in</text>
  <text start="24" dur="4.199">the country that would be really</text>
  <text start="25.769" dur="4.111">interesting maybe it even has a chance</text>
  <text start="28.199" dur="3.361">of passing this has been something that</text>
  <text start="29.88" dur="3.39">the NRA has been pushing for a long time</text>
  <text start="31.56" dur="4.38">and I mean they&amp;#39;re they have more</text>
  <text start="33.27" dur="4.65">support now than ever before so hey that</text>
  <text start="35.94" dur="3.81">wouldn&amp;#39;t that be awesome I mean imagine</text>
  <text start="37.92" dur="4.2">having a concealed carry gun in New York</text>
  <text start="39.75" dur="4.2">I mean you actually goes in places</text>
  <text start="42.12" dur="3.99">they&amp;#39;re otherwise quite dangerous to go</text>
  <text start="43.95" dur="5.609">like Chicago and New York and have your</text>
  <text start="46.11" dur="5.4">weapon protect yourself an armed society</text>
  <text start="49.559" dur="4.111">is a polite society just look at the</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="3.389">anti-shah versus patriot videos and then</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="5.909">look at the ones where the Patriots</text>
  <text start="54.899" dur="7.531">bring the runs a lot less violence now I</text>
  <text start="59.579" dur="5.91">want to talk about the 69 a massive</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="5.04">earthquakes in the last 72 hours or so I</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="5.67">think it&amp;#39;s actually higher than that now</text>
  <text start="67.47" dur="6.149">but this is pretty frightening and you</text>
  <text start="71.159" dur="3.96">know with that with that missile that</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="3.061">was supposedly you know I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="75.119" dur="5.221">what a nuclear powered missile is you</text>
  <text start="76.68" dur="5.729">know but whatever that is if that was</text>
  <text start="80.34" dur="3.63">lost at sea and then exploded in the sea</text>
  <text start="82.409" dur="3.331">with I don&amp;#39;t know if that would cause</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="4.11">any of this I&amp;#39;m by no means like an</text>
  <text start="85.74" dur="4.62">expert on this kind of stuff but it</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="3.57">definitely you know we&amp;#39;re seeing more</text>
  <text start="90.36" dur="5.969">and more activity around the Ring of</text>
  <text start="91.65" dur="7.71">Fire that is disturbing if I&amp;#39;m hey if a</text>
  <text start="96.329" dur="6.33">missile were to go off and cause a lot</text>
  <text start="99.36" dur="4.799">of you know tectonic activity then it</text>
  <text start="102.659" dur="4.291">could explain definitely some of these</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="4.021">earthquakes I don&amp;#39;t know I that kind of</text>
  <text start="106.95" dur="5.61">makes me worry about what would happen</text>
  <text start="108.18" dur="8.64">to the planet but hey the ran slumps</text>
  <text start="112.56" dur="6.659">Trump questions South Africa so Trump is</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="6.78">actually calling out what&amp;#39;s going on a</text>
  <text start="119.219" dur="6.421">little bit in South Africa with the the</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="4.529">basically the wholesale slaughter of</text>
  <text start="125.64" dur="4.17">farmers they they&amp;#39;re just killing the</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="3.481">white farmers there and now the South</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="3.59">African government has decided to just</text>
  <text start="131.61" dur="4.76">change the constitution to take</text>
  <text start="133.4" dur="5.64">the land by force some of the things</text>
  <text start="136.37" dur="6.179">that have happened recently just as an</text>
  <text start="139.04" dur="5.699">example one woman for the second time in</text>
  <text start="142.549" dur="3.78">a seven-month period was raped by five</text>
  <text start="144.739" dur="5.03">men violently in front of her young</text>
  <text start="146.329" dur="6.03">child you know people are getting killed</text>
  <text start="149.769" dur="4.33">people who have invested and went into</text>
  <text start="152.359" dur="5.16">debt and spent their whole lives working</text>
  <text start="154.099" dur="7.53">6 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the fields or losing</text>
  <text start="157.519" dur="5.94">their land and as I said before what the</text>
  <text start="161.629" dur="3.811">ultimate results of this will be there</text>
  <text start="163.459" dur="4.17">will be a huge humanitarian crisis</text>
  <text start="165.44" dur="6.03">obviously we&amp;#39;re gonna see some problems</text>
  <text start="167.629" dur="6.39">in terms of relocation and and slaughter</text>
  <text start="171.47" dur="4.26">of these people I mean Russia&amp;#39;s offered</text>
  <text start="174.019" dur="4.411">to take the men now Trump is making some</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="5.58">sort of efforts to call it out at least</text>
  <text start="178.43" dur="5.369">and May and draw attention to it some of</text>
  <text start="181.31" dur="3.78">the foremost media figures that are</text>
  <text start="183.799" dur="3.241">covering this would be like Lauren</text>
  <text start="185.09" dur="3.45">southern or something she&amp;#39;s actually got</text>
  <text start="187.04" dur="4.259">a documentary out there I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.54" dur="3.99">called um grasslands or something like</text>
  <text start="191.299" dur="3.121">that I don&amp;#39;t remember the name of it off</text>
  <text start="192.53" dur="3.98">the top of my head i watch her videos</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="5.01">but I don&amp;#39;t remember the documentary and</text>
  <text start="196.51" dur="6.039">it&amp;#39;s just really bad it&amp;#39;s so bad there</text>
  <text start="199.43" dur="4.769">and they&amp;#39;re actually they&amp;#39;re all but</text>
  <text start="202.549" dur="3.571">calling they just kill whitey and</text>
  <text start="204.199" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re having marches about kill the</text>
  <text start="206.12" dur="3.449">blower and all that other stuff and you</text>
  <text start="208.459" dur="3">know what what&amp;#39;s the what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="209.569" dur="3.54">consequences the consequences are when</text>
  <text start="211.459" dur="4.231">you kill all the expert farmers and try</text>
  <text start="213.109" dur="5.371">to take their land mass starvation is</text>
  <text start="215.69" dur="4.979">coming and I for one will not be sending</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="4.02">any food or or charity aid to these</text>
  <text start="220.669" dur="3.63">people in South Africa who are then</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="5.099">going to be suffering the consequences</text>
  <text start="224.299" dur="4.86">of their actions yes there are some good</text>
  <text start="227.599" dur="6.48">ones down there but you know they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="229.159" dur="6.151">where they now now continuing on I I do</text>
  <text start="234.079" dur="3.511">have a little bit of a tough-love</text>
  <text start="235.31" dur="4.049">approach to things folks and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="237.59" dur="4.139">that&amp;#39;s just part of who I am I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.359" dur="4.8">want to have any flak in the comments</text>
  <text start="241.729" dur="3.84">about this you know people have to you</text>
  <text start="244.159" dur="3.631">know accept the consequences of their</text>
  <text start="245.569" dur="3.81">actions sometimes and when you kill off</text>
  <text start="247.79" dur="4.47">your farmers and still their land and</text>
  <text start="249.379" dur="5.22">run them off and rape and kill then you</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="4.02">kind of deserve the starvation in my</text>
  <text start="254.599" dur="3.901">opinion maybe that&amp;#39;s just me maybe</text>
  <text start="256.28" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s hard-hearted I know I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="258.5" dur="5.52">perfect now let&amp;#39;s talk about Cohen and</text>
  <text start="262.01" dur="4.26">this Lanny Davis fellow so Lanny Davis</text>
  <text start="264.02" dur="5.25">is basically a Clinton friend</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="6.09">Clinton attorney for some reason Cohen</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="5.13">hired him to represent him even Lanny</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="3.839">Davis admits that Cohen has no evidence</text>
  <text start="274.4" dur="4.049">that Trump directed him to pay stormy</text>
  <text start="276.199" dur="5.071">and that it would come down possibly to</text>
  <text start="278.449" dur="5.641">Cohen&amp;#39;s word versus Trump&amp;#39;s so nothing</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="5.369">they have nothing and even Clinton&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="5.19">buddy admitted they have nothing now</text>
  <text start="286.639" dur="5.191">Lanny Davis is also a registered foreign</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="4.62">agent for a pro Russian oligarch the</text>
  <text start="291.83" dur="5.88">same one wanted by the US government and</text>
  <text start="293.9" dur="5.609">linked to Putin now WikiLeaks also a</text>
  <text start="297.71" dur="4.139">while back had had dropped some of the</text>
  <text start="299.509" dur="5.19">emails and Lanny Davis had actually</text>
  <text start="301.849" dur="5.13">basically volunteered to Podesta in one</text>
  <text start="304.699" dur="5.431">of those emails to to run damage control</text>
  <text start="306.979" dur="4.891">for Hillary&amp;#39;s email situation and also</text>
  <text start="310.13" dur="4.08">we in another one he basically kissed</text>
  <text start="311.87" dur="3.359">Podesta SAS and an all but called him</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="3.179">his favorite person</text>
  <text start="315.229" dur="4.111">I mean after my friends and or after my</text>
  <text start="317.389" dur="3.571">immediate family and my children you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="319.34" dur="6.75">my favorite person is basically what he</text>
  <text start="320.96" dur="8.16">said also and this is kind of a biggie</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="5.04">because this this actually from Lanny</text>
  <text start="329.12" dur="5.25">Davis Clinton&amp;#39;s fix her attorney</text>
  <text start="331.13" dur="5.069">actually contradicts from something that</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="4.97">was a big deal from the steel dossier</text>
  <text start="336.199" dur="5.611">which is that Cohen never went to Prague</text>
  <text start="339.34" dur="3.819">okay so the still dossier claims he went</text>
  <text start="341.81" dur="2.699">to Prague alright they were trying to</text>
  <text start="343.159" dur="4.37">set him up as some sort of like</text>
  <text start="344.509" dur="6.121">connection to Russia or something</text>
  <text start="347.529" dur="5.651">yeah and in other news we are also</text>
  <text start="350.63" dur="4.86">hearing that Mueller is gonna be</text>
  <text start="353.18" dur="5.039">indicted Ahnold Trump jr. okay Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="355.49" dur="7.169">son for the that whole Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="358.219" dur="7.44">Russian lawyer meeting and that that was</text>
  <text start="362.659" dur="7.051">a setup to begin with and really nothing</text>
  <text start="365.659" dur="6">illegal have in there but anyway that</text>
  <text start="369.71" dur="4.889">that is going to be a interesting</text>
  <text start="371.659" dur="4.651">situation and an interesting moment for</text>
  <text start="374.599" dur="4.35">though for the nation like that&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="376.31" dur="5.19">be a deciding moment for the nation I</text>
  <text start="378.949" dur="3.931">think because this is Trump&amp;#39;s family all</text>
  <text start="381.5" dur="5.699">right if they&amp;#39;re gonna try to go after</text>
  <text start="382.88" dur="6.33">Trump&amp;#39;s own son well we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="387.199" dur="3.571">seeing all of the rhetoric heat up</text>
  <text start="389.21" dur="3.75">lately we&amp;#39;re seeing Trump call off the</text>
  <text start="390.77" dur="3.899">censorship more than ever he&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="392.96" dur="3.78">going at that hard we&amp;#39;re seeing him call</text>
  <text start="394.669" dur="4.441">out sessions more than ever we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="396.74" dur="3.419">the left try to shout and stamp and</text>
  <text start="399.11" dur="3.989">scream for impeach</text>
  <text start="400.159" dur="5.611">even though they have nothing everything</text>
  <text start="403.099" dur="4.74">is building to a beautiful crescendo and</text>
  <text start="405.77" dur="5.489">I think it&amp;#39;s gonna smash down on their</text>
  <text start="407.839" dur="4.98">heads very soon just my opinion but as</text>
  <text start="411.259" dur="3.601">I&amp;#39;ve been saying for months now the</text>
  <text start="412.819" dur="3.75">midterms are here or are the midterms</text>

  <text start="416.569" dur="4.05">and everything is about to come out all</text>
  <text start="418.819" dur="4.53">the cards are gonna be played and I</text>
  <text start="420.619" dur="4.11">think that we are gonna find some of</text>
  <text start="423.349" dur="4.52">these people on the Left have been</text>
  <text start="424.729" dur="4.8">bluffing and Trump has a full house so</text>

  <text start="437.3" dur="3.569">are gonna be just fine I am very</text>
  <text start="439.099" dur="4.44">confident I&amp;#39;m very optimistic about the</text>
  <text start="440.869" dur="5.63">censorship thing as well I&amp;#39;m just I</text>
  <text start="443.539" dur="5.011">cannot wait to see when things are</text>
  <text start="446.499" dur="4.06">evened out a bit and the playing ground</text>
  <text start="448.55" dur="3.869">is a little bit more even in terms of</text>
  <text start="450.559" dur="5.25">censorship versus the old media and the</text>
  <text start="452.419" dur="5.67">fake news what is gonna happen I bet you</text>
  <text start="455.809" dur="4.59">that we are going to run the greatest</text>

  <text start="465.289" dur="5.46">open it up to the free market of ideas</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="5.469">and it&amp;#39;s all you know truth vs. lies and</text>
  <text start="470.749" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s no censorship and there&amp;#39;s none</text>
