  <text start="158.86" dur="5.97">my life they were things that I had</text>
  <text start="161.13" dur="5.859">avoided things that I kind of ignored</text>
  <text start="164.83" dur="5.129">things and I didn&amp;#39;t take on I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="166.989" dur="7.731">tackle them because when I was younger</text>
  <text start="169.959" dur="12.571">it seemed like avoiding these issues</text>
  <text start="174.72" dur="10.57">conflicts obstacles problems was just</text>
  <text start="182.53" dur="5.52">the easiest way to get through that time</text>
  <text start="185.29" dur="4.949">in my life just just avoid the problem</text>
  <text start="188.05" dur="7.35">don&amp;#39;t deal with it don&amp;#39;t confront the</text>
  <text start="190.239" dur="7.381">person don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t engage right and for</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="10.23">much of my life have been a person yeah</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="13.679">I&amp;#39;m an I&amp;#39;m an ESTJ actually I think sit</text>

  <text start="214.75" dur="6.72">calls the Guardian provider and I</text>
  <text start="218.769" dur="7.381">generally try to avoid conflict if</text>
  <text start="221.47" dur="6.15">possible I try to engage in things that</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="3.75">are helpful some things that are</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="4.29">productive and if I sense if something</text>
  <text start="229.9" dur="6.33">is not helpful or not productive I tend</text>
  <text start="231.91" dur="8.43">to avoid it and that&amp;#39;s why I avoid</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="5.64">ignore trolls block trolls ignore people</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="3.84">on social media who don&amp;#39;t have anything</text>
  <text start="241.87" dur="3.929">constructive to contribute that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.18" dur="4.05">something that I learned earlier or</text>
  <text start="245.799" dur="6.091">later in life so anyway in this dream I</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="5.819">was looking at a this is an abstract set</text>
  <text start="251.89" dur="5.159">of ideas so it&amp;#39;s not like I actually saw</text>
  <text start="254.049" dur="5.28">things in the natural that I had</text>
  <text start="257.049" dur="4.68">actually avoided or people I had avoided</text>
  <text start="259.329" dur="4.411">or situations I had avoided this is just</text>
  <text start="261.729" dur="3.661">an abstract set of ideas in the dream I</text>
  <text start="263.74" dur="3.03">knew they were things that I had just</text>
  <text start="265.39" dur="7.47">not dealt with</text>
  <text start="266.77" dur="8.13">throughout my life now as I&amp;#39;m sitting</text>
  <text start="272.86" dur="7.649">there in the dream I&amp;#39;m looking at these</text>
  <text start="274.9" dur="8.91">things and I realize my avoidance my</text>
  <text start="280.509" dur="3.601">decisions not to address not to tackle</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="5.31">them</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="9.08">not to take them on did not help me it</text>
  <text start="289.12" dur="7.1">actually it actually stunted my</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="5.979">potential growth if I would have</text>
  <text start="296.22" dur="5.8">addressed those things tackled them face</text>
  <text start="299.169" dur="4.53">them at the time I would be I would have</text>
  <text start="302.02" dur="5.899">been much farther ahead in life at that</text>
  <text start="303.699" dur="9.65">point but I avoided them all right</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="8.68">so in the dream I saw myself engaging</text>
  <text start="313.349" dur="7.35">these issues tackling the problems</text>
  <text start="316.599" dur="6.181">confronting these people in situations</text>
  <text start="320.699" dur="7.361">and at the end of the dream I was a much</text>
  <text start="322.78" dur="7.05">better person because of it and you know</text>
  <text start="328.06" dur="6.949">sometimes I have these dreams that are</text>
  <text start="329.83" dur="8.489">just like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a common sense but</text>
  <text start="335.009" dur="7.09">God often puts his finger on issues for</text>
  <text start="338.319" dur="5.91">us that we kind of know intellectually</text>
  <text start="342.099" dur="5.211">but we don&amp;#39;t really know down and deep</text>
  <text start="344.229" dur="9">inside of us things that God wants us to</text>
  <text start="347.31" dur="8.979">confront tackle address I&amp;#39;ve had a lot</text>
  <text start="353.229" dur="4.53">of personal dreams lately that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="356.289" dur="3.72">haven&amp;#39;t been posting all of them on</text>
  <text start="357.759" dur="5.011">Twitter if I have a relevant dream that</text>
  <text start="360.009" dur="4.831">I think will help other people yeah</text>
  <text start="362.77" dur="3.959">peeling the onion I&amp;#39;ll sometimes post</text>
  <text start="364.84" dur="4.259">them on Twitter some of the personal</text>
  <text start="366.729" dur="4.381">dreams are just for me and I don&amp;#39;t post</text>
  <text start="369.099" dur="3.63">those dreams this one I put up on</text>
  <text start="371.11" dur="8.13">Twitter because I thought it would be</text>
  <text start="372.729" dur="10.53">helpful and look the Bible says the</text>
  <text start="379.24" dur="7.2">Bible calls us overcomers he God has</text>
  <text start="383.259" dur="7.41">made us overcomers how are we how do we</text>
  <text start="386.44" dur="9.18">overcome by the blood of the Lamb by the</text>
  <text start="390.669" dur="9.051">word of our testimony and we we overcome</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="9.32">in a lot of ways we overcome things</text>
  <text start="399.72" dur="9.12">by tackling them by going after them I</text>
  <text start="404.94" dur="6.15">confronting them Jill I see that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="408.84" dur="6.56">on here I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;re listening</text>
  <text start="411.09" dur="7.62">Europe might be it might be at work but</text>
  <text start="415.4" dur="12.97">Jill came out here to Arizona last week</text>
  <text start="418.71" dur="11.31">and she she had back pain and we were</text>
  <text start="428.37" dur="3.27">sitting here in the kitchen talking and</text>
  <text start="430.02" dur="7.05">I said well let&amp;#39;s get you healing by the</text>
  <text start="431.64" dur="7.68">back pain she&amp;#39;d back in neck pain and it</text>
  <text start="437.07" dur="5.31">turns out what I found out is a lot of</text>
  <text start="439.32" dur="5.34">people have physical symptoms of chronic</text>
  <text start="442.38" dur="5.07">pain and illness it&amp;#39;s actually related</text>
  <text start="444.66" dur="6.09">to emotional trauma and the emotional</text>
  <text start="447.45" dur="4.95">trauma is generally connected to events</text>
  <text start="450.75" dur="6.72">and things from our past that we have</text>
  <text start="452.4" dur="8.28">not dealt with properly so I walked Jill</text>
  <text start="457.47" dur="5.49">through a little process where we dealt</text>
  <text start="460.68" dur="6.78">with this emotional trauma and boom her</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="8.24">back pain neck pain was gone in what I</text>
  <text start="467.46" dur="6.63">found in getting people healed is</text>
  <text start="471.2" dur="5.56">sometimes you can get people healed v of</text>
  <text start="474.09" dur="5.61">physical symptoms an illness just by</text>
  <text start="476.76" dur="7.17">releasing power sometimes by exercising</text>
  <text start="479.7" dur="7.23">Authority but many times the healing</text>
  <text start="483.93" dur="6.21">comes in dealing with past issues that</text>
  <text start="486.93" dur="4.65">we have not properly dealt with healing</text>
  <text start="490.14" dur="4.95">emotional wounds</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="5.16">sometimes forgiveness sometimes getting</text>
  <text start="495.09" dur="3.66">a different perspective on that past</text>
  <text start="496.74" dur="3.45">situation and sometimes confronting and</text>
  <text start="498.75" dur="1.8">dealing with those issues in a different</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="3.63">way</text>
  <text start="500.55" dur="8.61">a lot of times it&amp;#39;s letting go of things</text>
  <text start="503.82" dur="7.77">like anger or giving up feelings of</text>
  <text start="509.16" dur="3.98">shame and guilt giving those to God</text>
  <text start="511.59" dur="6.54">letting him take those things from me</text>
  <text start="513.14" dur="8.89">that is that is a very very important</text>
  <text start="518.13" dur="6.24">process in in being healed physically</text>
  <text start="522.03" dur="6.33">healed and emotionally human and what I</text>
  <text start="524.37" dur="8.44">what I have learned is any condition can</text>
  <text start="528.36" dur="8.08">be healed any illness any mental illness</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="5.61">condition can be healed if you are</text>
  <text start="536.44" dur="6.93">willing to submit yourself to the</text>
  <text start="538.42" dur="8.63">process god has a process that he can</text>
  <text start="543.37" dur="6.69">use to heal anything and what I found is</text>
  <text start="547.05" dur="5.62">many times we&amp;#39;re not healed because we</text>
  <text start="550.06" dur="5.73">will not submit to the process that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="552.67" dur="5.28">and look I have my own junk from my past</text>
  <text start="555.79" dur="3.48">that I hate some of which I&amp;#39;ve dealt</text>
  <text start="557.95" dur="5.01">with some of it I have not dealt with</text>
  <text start="559.27" dur="7.2">and I am NOT walking in full freedom and</text>
  <text start="562.96" dur="5.16">full Kingdom identity because I have not</text>
