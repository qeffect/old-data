  <text start="0.03" dur="6.539">welcome to supernatural Saturday we are</text>
  <text start="4.02" dur="7.17">continuing a study through my book</text>
  <text start="6.569" dur="10.681">divine healing made simple and today we</text>
  <text start="11.19" dur="8.88">are in chapter 13 which is a subject</text>
  <text start="17.25" dur="5.58">that I get more questions about than</text>
  <text start="20.07" dur="5.31">just about anything else I should have</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="2.97">done a video on this subject a long time</text>
  <text start="25.38" dur="1.8">ago</text>
  <text start="25.8" dur="5.34">it would have saved people a lot of</text>
  <text start="27.18" dur="6.57">trouble and a lot of questions people</text>
  <text start="31.14" dur="7.2">still have this misunderstanding about</text>
  <text start="33.75" dur="7.77">healing and the idea that healing is a</text>
  <text start="38.34" dur="5.37">gift and only certain people have it and</text>
  <text start="41.52" dur="4.859">it&amp;#39;s not something that everyone can</text>
  <text start="43.71" dur="5.4">have it&amp;#39;s only reserved for special</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="4.11">people I get more emails and more</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="2.039">questions on this and just about</text>
  <text start="50.489" dur="2.791">anything else</text>
  <text start="51.149" dur="5.131">and no matter how much I teach on it</text>
  <text start="53.28" dur="5.4">people still don&amp;#39;t seem to get it so I</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="6.329">am NOT going to stop preaching this</text>
  <text start="58.68" dur="7.35">message I am going to get people to</text>
  <text start="62.609" dur="5.881">understand anyone can heal the sick</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="5.33">anyone can raise the dead anyone can</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="6.69">cast out demons it is not a gift</text>
  <text start="71.36" dur="6.189">although there is a mention of healing</text>
  <text start="75.18" dur="6.03">as a spiritual gift in the Bible and</text>
  <text start="77.549" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re going to talk today about what the</text>
  <text start="81.21" dur="5.28">spiritual gift of healing and the</text>
  <text start="83.909" dur="5.67">spiritual gift of miracles is and how</text>
  <text start="86.49" dur="5.01">that is different from the power and</text>
  <text start="89.579" dur="4.11">authority for healing that all believers</text>
  <text start="91.5" dur="3.869">have it is completely different</text>
  <text start="93.689" dur="3.57">different operation for different</text>
  <text start="95.369" dur="7.471">purposes and that&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re going to cover</text>
  <text start="97.259" dur="8.18">today so I&amp;#39;m going to begin in one of my</text>
  <text start="102.84" dur="8.13">favorite chapters Matthew chapter 10 and</text>
  <text start="105.439" dur="9.851">the parallel chapter Luke chapter 9 I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="6.719">on Facebook under David Joseph my page</text>
  <text start="115.29" dur="5.1">is called praying medic my private</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="4.86">profile is David Joseph and I do my</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="4.17">video broadcast on Saturdays on my</text>
  <text start="122.549" dur="7.201">private profile and then I share them</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="8.55">over on my page all right so Matthew</text>
  <text start="129.75" dur="6.69">chapter 10 Jesus chose</text>
  <text start="133.11" dur="5.81">twelve disciples and the first thing he</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="9.62">did after he chose the twelve disciples</text>
  <text start="138.92" dur="9.91">was he told them to go to the cities</text>
  <text start="146.06" dur="7.39">surrounding the area is Israel</text>
  <text start="148.83" dur="8.73">and I said as you go preach saying the</text>
  <text start="153.45" dur="8.19">kingdom of heaven is at hand that is the</text>
  <text start="157.56" dur="5.97">message he gave the disciples the</text>
  <text start="161.64" dur="5.4">kingdom of heaven is at hand which is</text>
  <text start="163.53" dur="6.54">what Jesus told the people when he went</text>
  <text start="167.04" dur="6.72">What did he say repent for the kingdom</text>
  <text start="170.07" dur="8.55">of heaven is at hand and repent of</text>
  <text start="173.76" dur="8.04">course means change your thinking it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="6.63">Greek Greek word Metta Noah meta means</text>
  <text start="181.8" dur="6.15">changer beyond Noah means mind if his</text>
  <text start="185.25" dur="4.83">message was change your thinking change</text>
  <text start="187.95" dur="5.22">your way of seeing God of seeing</text>
  <text start="190.08" dur="5.79">yourself change your thinking because</text>
  <text start="193.17" dur="4.379">the Kingdom of Heaven or the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="3.6">God is at hand that was his message</text>
  <text start="197.549" dur="6.361">that&amp;#39;s the message he gave to his</text>
  <text start="199.47" dur="7.56">disciples to preach and verse 8 heal the</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="6.21">sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="3.44">cast out demons freely received freely</text>
  <text start="210.12" dur="4.619">give</text>
  <text start="210.47" dur="8.65">so the first Commission Jesus gave His</text>
  <text start="214.739" dur="6.481">disciples was to preach the kingdom heal</text>
  <text start="219.12" dur="5.369">the sick raise the dead cast out demons</text>
  <text start="221.22" dur="6.18">now how were they able to do that did</text>
  <text start="224.489" dur="5.191">they have a gift did Jesus give them the</text>
  <text start="227.4" dur="3.809">gift of healing that they all just did</text>
  <text start="229.68" dur="3.24">he just picked the ones who were gifted</text>
  <text start="231.209" dur="5.871">that he know the ones who had the</text>
  <text start="232.92" dur="7.56">ability the gift - no no he gave them</text>
  <text start="237.08" dur="5.5">power and authority okay so let&amp;#39;s go to</text>
  <text start="240.48" dur="4.59">Luke chapter 9 verse 1 this is the</text>
  <text start="242.58" dur="4.409">parallel passage then he called his</text>
  <text start="245.07" dur="6.03">twelve disciples together and he gave</text>
  <text start="246.989" dur="11.131">them power and authority over demons and</text>
  <text start="251.1" dur="9.84">to cure diseases because authority gives</text>
  <text start="258.12" dur="5.91">us the ability to cast out demons power</text>
  <text start="260.94" dur="4.979">gives us the ability to cure diseases</text>
  <text start="264.03" dur="2.99">they&amp;#39;re two different operations and</text>
  <text start="265.919" dur="4.22">we&amp;#39;ve talked about that</text>
  <text start="267.02" dur="4.56">in my previous messages how power and</text>
  <text start="270.139" dur="4.62">authority works slightly differently but</text>
  <text start="271.58" dur="6.63">this is something he gave his disciples</text>
  <text start="274.759" dur="6.06">okay not a gift it&amp;#39;s not like they were</text>
  <text start="278.21" dur="5.34">born with it he their disciples he gave</text>
  <text start="280.819" dur="6.331">them power he gave them authority okay</text>
  <text start="283.55" dur="6.209">that&amp;#39;s how it works and let me just say</text>
  <text start="287.15" dur="5.88">this let me give you an analogy to maybe</text>
  <text start="289.759" dur="6.78">help understand how this works if you</text>
  <text start="293.03" dur="8.43">were imagine yourself being a child who</text>
  <text start="296.539" dur="8.13">is one year old and you&amp;#39;re in a nursery</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="7.079">and a daycare with a bunch of other</text>
  <text start="304.669" dur="7.291">one-year-old children yeah Luke 9 verse</text>
  <text start="308.539" dur="5.041">1 now you are a one-year-old child and</text>
  <text start="311.96" dur="4.38">you&amp;#39;re in a nursery with a bunch of</text>
  <text start="313.58" dur="7.019">other 1 year olds and most of the 1 year</text>
  <text start="316.34" dur="6.24">olds in that nursery cannot walk but</text>
  <text start="320.599" dur="4.891">there&amp;#39;s one child in that nursery who</text>
  <text start="322.58" dur="4.709">has developed the ability to walk so</text>
  <text start="325.49" dur="4.29">while everybody else is crawling around</text>
  <text start="327.289" dur="6.6">on the floor this one child is up</text>
  <text start="329.78" dur="7.97">walking around like an adult and then a</text>
  <text start="333.889" dur="9">couple of weeks later this one child is</text>
  <text start="337.75" dur="6.88">running now do you imagine that the</text>
  <text start="342.889" dur="5.46">children in that nursery are going to</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="6.509">say wow that that kid over there really</text>
  <text start="348.349" dur="5.761">has a gift of walking because we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="351.139" dur="5.161">do that we can&amp;#39;t walk that child must be</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="5.33">gifted they must have something we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="356.3" dur="5.79">have they must have some god-given</text>
  <text start="359.44" dur="4.62">talent or gift that nobody else has</text>
  <text start="362.09" dur="6.96">because nobody else is doing it</text>
  <text start="364.06" dur="7.599">so when we see people do miracles and</text>
  <text start="369.05" dur="5.64">raising the dead and healing if we are</text>
  <text start="371.659" dur="6.331">not doing it ourselves it&amp;#39;s easy for us</text>
  <text start="374.69" dur="5.789">to think oh they must be gifted they</text>
  <text start="377.99" dur="6.78">must have a gift I don&amp;#39;t have that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="380.479" dur="8.401">they&amp;#39;re doing it and I&amp;#39;m not in fact we</text>
  <text start="384.77" dur="6.989">know that child is walking at 1 year old</text>
  <text start="388.88" dur="5.7">simply because that child has gotten up</text>
  <text start="391.759" dur="5.731">on hands and knees and started to walk</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="4.98">and fell got up again walked a little</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="3.21">more fell again walked a little more</text>
  <text start="399.56" dur="4.05">elegant</text>
  <text start="400.7" dur="5.88">that child is developing a natural</text>
  <text start="403.61" dur="11.46">ability that they were born with not a</text>
  <text start="406.58" dur="12.3">gift we are made in the image of God God</text>
  <text start="415.07" dur="10.53">is a spirit we are made in the image of</text>
  <text start="418.88" dur="10.62">God the nature of God is to heal as God</text>
  <text start="425.6" dur="8.07">revealed himself to Moses he one of his</text>
  <text start="429.5" dur="9.39">name&amp;#39;s is Jehovah Rapha I am the Lord</text>
  <text start="433.67" dur="9.48">who heals you if it is God&amp;#39;s nature to</text>
  <text start="438.89" dur="6.81">heal then it is our nature to be healers</text>
  <text start="443.15" dur="5.58">and all Jesus was doing with his</text>
  <text start="445.7" dur="4.89">disciples was opening their eyes and</text>
  <text start="448.73" dur="4.35">their mind and giving them understanding</text>
  <text start="450.59" dur="5.61">that they had god-given power and</text>
  <text start="453.08" dur="8.79">authority to heal not that they were</text>
  <text start="456.2" dur="10.32">born with a gift Healing is an ability</text>
  <text start="461.87" dur="7.05">that needs to be developed it is a</text>
  <text start="466.52" dur="5.67">god-given ability every one of us have I</text>
  <text start="468.92" dur="5.64">can take you if you have never seen</text>
  <text start="472.19" dur="5.1">anyone healed if you&amp;#39;ve never seen a</text>
  <text start="474.56" dur="5.07">miracle I can take to you in one hour</text>
  <text start="477.29" dur="5.25">and teach you and train you and through</text>
  <text start="479.63" dur="4.95">some demonstrations I can have you</text>
  <text start="482.54" dur="5.91">healing the sick in an hour I&amp;#39;ve done it</text>
  <text start="484.58" dur="5.46">I&amp;#39;ve shown people how to operate and</text>
  <text start="488.45" dur="4.56">healing who&amp;#39;ve never done it before and</text>
  <text start="490.04" dur="6.09">it&amp;#39;s not because I discovered that they</text>
  <text start="493.01" dur="5.82">have a gift it&amp;#39;s because I explain to</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="4.65">them their identity I help them</text>
  <text start="498.83" dur="4.11">understand the power that they have the</text>
  <text start="500.78" dur="4.44">power of God that lives inside of them I</text>
  <text start="502.94" dur="4.89">help them understand their authority and</text>
  <text start="505.22" dur="3.84">then we did some demonstration and some</text>
  <text start="507.83" dur="5.1">practice and pretty soon they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="509.06" dur="5.49">people healed actually that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="512.93" dur="5.25">what I do in my healing class I have an</text>
  <text start="514.55" dur="7.679">online class and it&amp;#39;s fairly intense and</text>
  <text start="518.18" dur="9.27">it&amp;#39;s pretty structured but I love</text>
  <text start="522.229" dur="8.431">teaching people how to learn to develop</text>
  <text start="527.45" dur="6.24">this ability that we all have it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="530.66" dur="5.71">ability it&amp;#39;s not a gift</text>
  <text start="533.69" dur="6.25">let me give you one more scripture this</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="8.31">is first Corinthians 2 verses 4 and 5</text>
  <text start="539.94" dur="7.8">the Apostle Paul said my speech and my</text>
  <text start="544.68" dur="6.81">preaching were not with persuasive words</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="6.57">of human wisdom but in demonstration of</text>
  <text start="551.49" dur="5.7">the Spirit and of power that your faith</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="6.24">would not be in the wisdom of men but in</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="5.28">the power of God so the Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="560.55" dur="6.75">recognized that when we preach the</text>
  <text start="562.47" dur="8.19">gospel merely preaching words is not</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="5.25">enough we need to demonstrate the power</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="4.29">of God we need to demonstrate the</text>
  <text start="572.55" dur="4.47">reality of God&amp;#39;s kingdom demonstrate his</text>
  <text start="574.95" dur="5.46">love for people by getting them healed</text>
  <text start="577.02" dur="5.27">that is what the you don&amp;#39;t really fully</text>
  <text start="580.41" dur="4.5">preach the gospel if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="582.29" dur="6.52">demonstrate the miraculous that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="584.91" dur="6.51">Jesus said in in Matthew 10 he said</text>
  <text start="588.81" dur="5.339">proclaim the kingdom heal the sick raise</text>
  <text start="591.42" dur="4.56">the dead cast out demons they go</text>
  <text start="594.149" dur="5.221">together you preach the message and you</text>
  <text start="595.98" dur="8.97">demonstrate the supernatural that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="599.37" dur="10.29">it&amp;#39;s supposed to work now there is a</text>
  <text start="604.95" dur="8.43">gift of healing but because people look</text>
  <text start="609.66" dur="6.36">in the scriptures and they think oh gift</text>
  <text start="613.38" dur="4.11">of healing Oh a gift oh that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="616.02" dur="5.45">that some people have and something that</text>
  <text start="617.49" dur="9.599">I don&amp;#39;t have no that is not how it is</text>
  <text start="621.47" dur="6.85">alright so let me read to you from 1st</text>
  <text start="627.089" dur="5.011">Corinthians 12</text>
  <text start="628.32" dur="6">on the spiritual gifts but the</text>
  <text start="632.1" dur="6.45">manifestation of the Spirit is given to</text>
  <text start="634.32" dur="6.95">each to each to everyone who&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="638.55" dur="6.029">believer right so if you&amp;#39;re a believer</text>
  <text start="641.27" dur="5.259">the manifestations of the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="644.579" dur="4.831">are given to you and me and your friends</text>
  <text start="646.529" dur="5.31">and oh the manifestations of the Holy</text>
  <text start="649.41" dur="7.56">Spirit the gifts of the Spirit are given</text>
  <text start="651.839" dur="8.701">to each one for the profit of all the</text>
  <text start="656.97" dur="5.79">gifts are given to all of us so that all</text>
  <text start="660.54" dur="5.43">of us the entire body of Christ can</text>
  <text start="662.76" dur="4.26">benefit for to one is given the word of</text>
  <text start="665.97" dur="3.6">wisdom through this</text>
  <text start="667.02" dur="5.13">to another the word of knowledge to be</text>
  <text start="669.57" dur="5.84">the same spirit to another faith by the</text>
  <text start="672.15" dur="7.47">same spirit to another gifts of healings</text>
  <text start="675.41" dur="7.93">plural by the same spirit to another the</text>
  <text start="679.62" dur="6.36">working of miracles plural by the same</text>
  <text start="683.34" dur="4.77">spirit to another prophecy to another</text>
  <text start="685.98" dur="5.01">discerning of spirits to another</text>
  <text start="688.11" dur="5.16">different kinds of tongues to another</text>
  <text start="690.99" dur="4.05">the interpretation of tongues but one in</text>
  <text start="693.27" dur="4.38">the same spirit works all these things</text>
  <text start="695.04" dur="7.11">distributing to each one individually as</text>
  <text start="697.65" dur="7.83">he wills for as the body is not one but</text>
  <text start="702.15" dur="7.62">has many members but all the members of</text>
  <text start="705.48" dur="8.13">that one body being many are one body so</text>
  <text start="709.77" dur="7.53">also is Christ for by one spirit we were</text>
  <text start="713.61" dur="6.96">baptized into one body whether Jew or</text>
  <text start="717.3" dur="5.33">Greek or their slave or free and all</text>
  <text start="720.57" dur="5.07">have been made to drink into one spirit</text>
  <text start="722.63" dur="7.65">for in fact the body is not one member</text>
  <text start="725.64" dur="8.1">but many so Paul is teaching here that</text>
  <text start="730.28" dur="6.34">believers make up a body and that is</text>
  <text start="733.74" dur="6.9">called the church the ecclesia it is the</text>
  <text start="736.62" dur="7.8">body of believers so Paul was teaching</text>
  <text start="740.64" dur="6.48">that the manifestations of the Holy</text>
  <text start="744.42" dur="7.64">Spirit the gifts of the Spirit are given</text>
  <text start="747.12" dur="7.5">to each of us for the benefit of all now</text>
  <text start="752.06" dur="5.08">here is the thing you need to understand</text>
  <text start="754.62" dur="7.38">about the spiritual gifts they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="757.14" dur="6.9">given for evangelism of the world we</text>
  <text start="762" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t use the spiritual gifts to</text>

  <text start="916.629" dur="6.57">operations they&amp;#39;re very similar but they</text>
  <text start="919.18" dur="6.659">have a different purpose and all of us</text>
  <text start="923.199" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;re believers have power and authority</text>
