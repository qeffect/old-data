  <text start="49.899" dur="3.3">mainstream media were saying Trump</text>
  <text start="51.729" dur="4.68">really knocked out of the parts none of</text>
  <text start="53.199" dur="5.331">the presidential did a great job CNN had</text>

  <text start="98.53" dur="5.46">and Senate are dragging everything out</text>
  <text start="101.92" dur="5.34">as long as I can this is part of their</text>
  <text start="103.99" dur="5.309">strategy Arthur strategy is to drag the</text>
  <text start="107.26" dur="4.59">process out as long as it can so the</text>
  <text start="109.299" dur="4.651">president is playing without a full team</text>
  <text start="111.85" dur="5.18">he doesn&amp;#39;t have his full cabinet and</text>
  <text start="113.95" dur="6.959">here&amp;#39;s the interesting historical fact</text>
  <text start="117.03" dur="7.35">no president since George Washington has</text>
  <text start="120.909" dur="7.051">gone this long without his cabinet being</text>
  <text start="124.38" dur="6.04">confirmed George Washington the first</text>
  <text start="127.96" dur="4.949">president had his cabinet confirmed long</text>
  <text start="130.42" dur="5.34">before this and they are dragging out</text>
  <text start="132.909" dur="4.97">the confirmation of the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.76" dur="4.35">cabinet as long as they can and</text>
  <text start="137.879" dur="5.231">unfortunately this is what we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="140.11" dur="5.7">to see for the next four years possibly</text>
  <text start="143.11" dur="4.559">eight years the Democratic Party has</text>
  <text start="145.81" dur="4.89">they&amp;#39;re in a difficult they&amp;#39;re in a</text>
  <text start="147.669" dur="4.441">difficult situation Republicans control</text>
  <text start="150.7" dur="3.3">the house</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="4.05">and the Senate and the White House and</text>
  <text start="154" dur="5.1">soon they will control the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="156.16" dur="5.46">and that we ensure but you&amp;#39;re the party</text>
  <text start="159.1" dur="4.77">that&amp;#39;s out of power that&amp;#39;s difficult but</text>
  <text start="161.62" dur="4.5">there but the Democratic Party is trying</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="3.81">to obstruct everything that president</text>
  <text start="166.12" dur="3.99">Trump is trying to do and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.68" dur="4.83">getting help from some Republicans like</text>
  <text start="170.11" dur="4.47">McCain and Lindsey Graham who don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="172.51" dur="5.37">president Trump and are going to try to</text>
  <text start="174.58" dur="5.31">help the Democrats sabotage everything</text>
  <text start="177.88" dur="3.81">from the beginning so that that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="179.89" dur="4.83">going on there are many unfortunately</text>
  <text start="181.69" dur="6.21">many Republicans on key committees who</text>
  <text start="184.72" dur="5.73">are in collusion with the Democrats to</text>
  <text start="187.9" dur="5.7">try to sabotage what the president is</text>
  <text start="190.45" dur="6.509">doing the president has a difficult road</text>
  <text start="193.6" dur="6.27">right now now I want talk about jeff</text>
  <text start="196.959" dur="4.651">Sessions so they tried through</text>
  <text start="199.87" dur="4.05">everything they could at jeff sessions</text>
  <text start="201.61" dur="5.61">during his confirmation hearing to try</text>
  <text start="203.92" dur="5.84">to be legitimized him as attorney</text>
  <text start="207.22" dur="6.57">general didn&amp;#39;t work he got confirmed</text>
  <text start="209.76" dur="6.82">they&amp;#39;re not through with their attempts</text>
  <text start="213.79" dur="5.43">to try to deal ajith amide him in the</text>
  <text start="216.58" dur="4.2">same way that is up his opponents have</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="4.14">been trying to deal ajith amide his</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="5.31">presidency through the russian hacking</text>
  <text start="223.36" dur="4.379">through all the other things they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="226.09" dur="4.35">thrown all the protests and everything</text>
  <text start="227.739" dur="4.801">else they&amp;#39;ve been trying to deal ajith</text>
  <text start="230.44" dur="3.9">amide his presidency even though he was</text>
  <text start="232.54" dur="3.06">elected we&amp;#39;re going to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="3.42">with jeff Sessions they&amp;#39;ll do the same</text>
  <text start="235.6" dur="4.199">thing with ben Carson they did it with</text>
  <text start="237.76" dur="3.93">Flynn and they got Flynn out of the out</text>
  <text start="239.799" dur="5.131">of the cabinet here&amp;#39;s what happened with</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="7.17">Flynn general Flynn as national security</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="8.07">advisor has ambassadors and diplomats</text>
  <text start="248.86" dur="7.05">all of the world who act as you know</text>
  <text start="253" dur="4.169">counterpart to what Jeff Linda sir so he</text>
  <text start="255.91" dur="2.73">has these conversations with these</text>
  <text start="257.169" dur="3.031">people all the time nothing illegal</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="3.779">right we talked about this before the</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="3.45">FBI looked at it everybody in the</text>
  <text start="262.419" dur="3.511">intelligence community said there was</text>
  <text start="263.65" dur="5.67">nothing that general Flynn did that was</text>
  <text start="265.93" dur="6.33">criminal or wrong or illegal the problem</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="6.72">with general Flynn was he gave a</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="6.12">briefing to Mike Pence and didn&amp;#39;t tell</text>
  <text start="276.04" dur="7.23">him all of the details of the</text>
  <text start="278.38" dur="5.13">conversation so Mike Pence goes on face</text>
  <text start="283.27" dur="4.98">it</text>
  <text start="283.51" dur="7.77">nation and talked about what general</text>
  <text start="288.25" dur="6">Flynn conversation was about not knowing</text>
  <text start="291.28" dur="6.48">all the details later it comes out that</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="8.58">Flynn had other conversations and Mike</text>
  <text start="297.76" dur="6.24">Pence felt like he got set up he felt</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="4.44">like he didn&amp;#39;t get all the information</text>
  <text start="304" dur="4.5">and he felt like he should have had all</text>
  <text start="307.27" dur="5.67">the information because he got in a</text>
  <text start="308.5" dur="5.76">difficult spot so unfortunately and I</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="5.73">personally think this is the wrong move</text>
  <text start="314.26" dur="6.75">they cut general Flynn lose out of the</text>
  <text start="318.67" dur="6.48">administration basically because the</text>
  <text start="321.01" dur="6.66">mainstream media demanded it and the</text>
  <text start="325.15" dur="5.22">mainstream media got their scalp they</text>
  <text start="327.67" dur="6.27">got general Flynn removed from the</text>
  <text start="330.37" dur="5.25">cabinet it was what they wanted and now</text>
  <text start="333.94" dur="4.95">that the mainstream media and the</text>
  <text start="335.62" dur="5.46">Democrats got one scalp they saw the</text>
  <text start="338.89" dur="5.49">Trump was willing to get rid of one of</text>
  <text start="341.08" dur="5.42">his own people when there was a big</text>
  <text start="344.38" dur="4.41">screaming hissy fit over what happened</text>
  <text start="346.5" dur="4.66">so they&amp;#39;re going to bring up everything</text>
  <text start="348.79" dur="5.97">and anything that can to try to get the</text>
  <text start="351.16" dur="6.66">President to take out his own cabinet</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="6.02">now unfortunately the situation with</text>
  <text start="357.82" dur="6.33">general Flynn I think it was a bad idea</text>
  <text start="360.78" dur="5.17">only because it gave the mainstream</text>
  <text start="364.15" dur="4.53">media exactly what they wanted they</text>
  <text start="365.95" dur="4.82">wanted a body and they got a body and</text>
  <text start="368.68" dur="6.87">now they&amp;#39;re going to be looking for more</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="9.1">jeff Sessions has been a sitting member</text>
  <text start="375.55" dur="8.91">of Congress for years he serves on many</text>

  <text start="2496.08" dur="4.53">periscope and Facebook live video at the</text>
  <text start="2498.72" dur="7.47">same time but I only have one smartphone</text>
  <text start="2500.61" dur="6.51">so what I did was I downloaded a program</text>
  <text start="2506.19" dur="5">on</text>
  <text start="2507.12" dur="8.03">my laptop that is a an android emulator</text>
  <text start="2511.19" dur="6.22">so it emulates and it simulates the</text>
  <text start="2515.15" dur="4.75">Android operating system of your mobile</text>
  <text start="2517.41" dur="6">phone and you can install all the mobile</text>
  <text start="2519.9" dur="7.56">apps on it and run them so on my laptop</text>
  <text start="2523.41" dur="7.05">here you can see that this is my android</text>
  <text start="2527.46" dur="6.36">emulator right here and down here I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2530.46" dur="7.44">got my periscope and my facebook apps</text>

  <text start="2537.9" dur="6.12">periscope or facebook broadcast I can do</text>
  <text start="2541.71" dur="4.86">it from a laptop on the Android system</text>
  <text start="2544.02" dur="5.16">emulator it just opens a little window</text>
  <text start="2546.57" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s like a smartphone I&amp;#39;m you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="2549.18" dur="6.9">your laptop so what I can do with that</text>
  <text start="2552" dur="7.2">is I can periscope from that facebook</text>
  <text start="2556.08" dur="5.01">from this and youtube for my webcam I</text>
  <text start="2559.2" dur="3.75">can do three I could be broadcasting on</text>
  <text start="2561.09" dur="4.7">three different networks the same time</text>
  <text start="2562.95" dur="5.91">and I will probably start doing that</text>
  <text start="2565.79" dur="6.04">here&amp;#39;s the deal we have to think outside</text>
  <text start="2568.86" dur="7.26">the box we have to get outside the box</text>
  <text start="2571.83" dur="7.14">we have to start looking at different</text>
  <text start="2576.12" dur="5.46">ways to an impact and effect our culture</text>
  <text start="2578.97" dur="5.34">to teach them to mentor to train and</text>
  <text start="2581.58" dur="5.01">disciple our culture and our culture is</text>
  <text start="2584.31" dur="4.02">moving more and more toward video look</text>
  <text start="2586.59" dur="4.02">you know we&amp;#39;re going to be dinosaurs</text>
  <text start="2588.33" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;re going to be dinosaurs if we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2590.61" dur="6.69">learn how to use video I love writing</text>
  <text start="2594.18" dur="5.55">I&amp;#39;m a writer but I have decided and the</text>
  <text start="2597.3" dur="5.01">Lord has shown me I need to learn how to</text>
  <text start="2599.73" dur="5.01">use video better more effectively made</text>
  <text start="2602.31" dur="5.52">to reach more people there are many</text>
  <text start="2604.74" dur="5.07">different ways that people access</text>
  <text start="2607.83" dur="4.65">information one of the reasons why i</text>
  <text start="2609.81" dur="4.98">started taking my podcast and putting</text>
  <text start="2612.48" dur="5.28">them over on youtube as i had people</text>
  <text start="2614.79" dur="5.7">asking me I&amp;#39;m deaf I can&amp;#39;t hear your</text>
  <text start="2617.76" dur="6.72">podcast can you take your podcast and</text>
  <text start="2620.49" dur="7.95">translate them so I can read them and</text>
  <text start="2624.48" dur="8.73">I&amp;#39;m like just a lot of work but when you</text>
  <text start="2628.44" dur="7.13">upload a YouTube video Google&amp;#39;s software</text>
  <text start="2633.21" dur="6.33">it will create a transcript of your</text>
  <text start="2635.57" dur="5.12">video if it&amp;#39;s able to hear the audio it</text>
  <text start="2639.54" dur="3.67">will create a written</text>
  <text start="2640.69" dur="6.179">in script so what I found out is with my</text>
  <text start="2643.21" dur="5.399">podcast I take the podcast I put it in</text>
  <text start="2646.869" dur="4.861">my little program here I turn into a</text>
  <text start="2648.609" dur="4.921">video I just have a splash screen with</text>
  <text start="2651.73" dur="4.379">the pragmatic thing on there it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2653.53" dur="5.49">really just audio but it&amp;#39;s on a video</text>
  <text start="2656.109" dur="5.371">format I upload it to youtube and within</text>
  <text start="2659.02" dur="4.62">a couple of hours they have a transcript</text>
  <text start="2661.48" dur="4.83">a written transcript of the entire show</text>
  <text start="2663.64" dur="5.16">that people who are deaf can go there</text>
  <text start="2666.31" dur="4.769">and read what it is I&amp;#39;m talking about on</text>
  <text start="2668.8" dur="3.93">my podcast there are going to be some</text>
  <text start="2671.079" dur="3.811">errors you can kind of it&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="2672.73" dur="3.54">like ninety ninety percent ninety-five</text>
  <text start="2674.89" dur="3.9">percent accurate there are some errors</text>
  <text start="2676.27" dur="4.43">but it&amp;#39;s better than nothing it&amp;#39;s you</text>
  <text start="2678.79" dur="4.829">know if you can take a two hour podcast</text>
  <text start="2680.7" dur="5.619">put it up on YouTube and have a person</text>
  <text start="2683.619" dur="5.46">read the entire thing and most of it be</text>
  <text start="2686.319" dur="5.341">accurate that&amp;#39;s pretty cool to me that</text>
  <text start="2689.079" dur="4.651">significant these are the kind of things</text>
  <text start="2691.66" dur="4.05">you need to be thinking about how do you</text>
  <text start="2693.73" dur="3.96">reach people who are deaf how do you</text>
  <text start="2695.71" dur="5.01">reach the blind how do you reach people</text>
  <text start="2697.69" dur="5.07">who only have time to listen to an audio</text>
  <text start="2700.72" dur="5.52">but not a video we need to become</text>
  <text start="2702.76" dur="5.88">multimedia Kingdom people we need to be</text>
  <text start="2706.24" dur="5.579">able to reach people in whatever format</text>
  <text start="2708.64" dur="6.06">whatever platform there on I would love</text>
  <text start="2711.819" dur="6.151">to do audiobooks I have had people</text>
  <text start="2714.7" dur="6">request would you please do an audiobook</text>
  <text start="2717.97" dur="4.71">and don&amp;#39;t hire somebody do it in your</text>
  <text start="2720.7" dur="7.669">own voice you have to record the audio</text>
  <text start="2722.68" dur="9.12">files all right that takes time and</text>
  <text start="2728.369" dur="6.041">here&amp;#39;s the thing when i looked at amazon</text>
  <text start="2731.8" dur="7.41">of book sales and it looked at the</text>
  <text start="2734.41" dur="7.8">breakdown of paperback vs kindle versus</text>
  <text start="2739.21" dur="6.119">audiobooks only ten percent of all book</text>
  <text start="2742.21" dur="5.609">sales and Amazon are audio that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2745.329" dur="4.051">relatively small number of books there</text>
  <text start="2747.819" dur="4.831">aren&amp;#39;t that many people that are</text>
  <text start="2749.38" dur="6.27">listening to audiobooks now here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2752.65" dur="6.09">problem again some people will only</text>
  <text start="2755.65" dur="5.219">listen to audiobooks you won&amp;#39;t read a</text>
  <text start="2758.74" dur="5.609">book they won&amp;#39;t buy an e-book they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2760.869" dur="6.781">only going to buy the audio version so I</text>
  <text start="2764.349" dur="6.541">have to sit down and think how much time</text>
  <text start="2767.65" dur="4.83">is going to take me to read the script</text>
  <text start="2770.89" dur="3.719">for all of my books</text>
  <text start="2772.48" dur="4.17">and then edit the audio file and then</text>
  <text start="2774.609" dur="4.651">upload them and how many people have</text>
  <text start="2776.65" dur="4.83">actually Richard it takes me it takes me</text>
  <text start="2779.26" dur="4.38">three days to read through a book and</text>
  <text start="2781.48" dur="4.139">then do the editing of the audio file</text>
  <text start="2783.64" dur="4.59">and upload it and then there&amp;#39;s a cost</text>
  <text start="2785.619" dur="5.011">for all of that I have to weigh how</text>
  <text start="2788.23" dur="3.33">what&amp;#39;s the cost versus the benefit how</text>
  <text start="2790.63" dur="2.88">many people are actually going to</text>
  <text start="2791.56" dur="3.69">download the book and how much time is</text>
  <text start="2793.51" dur="4.109">going to take out of my day when I could</text>
  <text start="2795.25" dur="5.01">be doing something else like video I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2797.619" dur="7.951">weighing all of that I have had some</text>
  <text start="2800.26" dur="9.75">very wonderful people who really really</text>
  <text start="2805.57" dur="6.299">want me to do the audio project I and I</text>

  <text start="3164.96" dur="5.46">and blood it&amp;#39;s not actual people there</text>
  <text start="3167.6" dur="5.13">are spirits behind</text>
  <text start="3170.42" dur="4.28">this deception and the water were</text>
  <text start="3172.73" dur="5.16">fighting so we need to be when we pray</text>
  <text start="3174.7" dur="5.159">we&amp;#39;re praying to disempower the evil</text>
  <text start="3177.89" dur="5.52">spirits that are bringing this agenda I</text>
  <text start="3179.859" dur="6.281">want to finish up with suggestion for</text>
  <text start="3183.41" dur="8.09">prayer I have I have a good friend who</text>
  <text start="3186.14" dur="8.82">had some dreams about the president and</text>
  <text start="3191.5" dur="6.49">he had a he actually had he was</text>
  <text start="3194.96" dur="4.71">translocated to the White House and he</text>
  <text start="3197.99" dur="3.059">was privy to some things that were going</text>
  <text start="3199.67" dur="4.199">on there I can&amp;#39;t tell you what that was</text>
  <text start="3201.049" dur="7.431">about but I can tell you this in the</text>
  <text start="3203.869" dur="8.46">dreams he was shown two important things</text>
  <text start="3208.48" dur="5.859">one was about us believers the body of</text>
  <text start="3212.329" dur="5.641">Christ and the other was about the White</text>
  <text start="3214.339" dur="6.27">House staff this if you don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="3217.97" dur="5.94">anything else in this video listen to</text>
  <text start="3220.609" dur="5.581">this and consider this in the dream in</text>
  <text start="3223.91" dur="6.06">the first stream that my friend had the</text>
  <text start="3226.19" dur="6.179">Holy Spirit was showing him the body of</text>
  <text start="3229.97" dur="5.31">Christ particularly people who support</text>
  <text start="3232.369" dur="4.911">the president and what the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="3235.28" dur="5.059">said is there supporting the president</text>
  <text start="3237.28" dur="5.89">but they do not have the mind of Christ</text>
  <text start="3240.339" dur="5.291">they do not yet understand what my</text>
  <text start="3243.17" dur="6.51">purpose is what I&amp;#39;m trying to accomplish</text>
  <text start="3245.63" dur="10.169">and what my heart is for this nation and</text>
  <text start="3249.68" dur="9.929">for the presidency and until we get the</text>
  <text start="3255.799" dur="6.841">mind of Christ until we get the Lord&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3259.609" dur="5.22">perspective on all of this we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3262.64" dur="6.03">really help we can try to help the</text>
  <text start="3264.829" dur="6.631">president but we need to be in alignment</text>
  <text start="3268.67" dur="5.37">and we need to understand what the Holy</text>
  <text start="3271.46" dur="7.23">Spirit is saying what God is trying to</text>
  <text start="3274.04" dur="7.98">accomplish and not support things that</text>
  <text start="3278.69" dur="4.919">are not the will of God we okay so</text>
  <text start="3282.02" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s the first thing we have to</text>
  <text start="3283.609" dur="3.931">understand is we have to get the mind of</text>
  <text start="3286.19" dur="4.369">Christ we have to get the lower tart</text>
  <text start="3287.54" dur="7.65">about the situation so your assignment</text>
  <text start="3290.559" dur="7.81">for tonight and tomorrow is seek the</text>
  <text start="3295.19" dur="6.69">Lord ask for dreams as for visions ask</text>
  <text start="3298.369" dur="5.101">for revelation ask the Lord to show you</text>
  <text start="3301.88" dur="5.1">tell you person</text>
  <text start="3303.47" dur="6.81">only what he wants to accomplish in the</text>
  <text start="3306.98" dur="5.61">next four years once you understand what</text>
  <text start="3310.28" dur="4.79">he&amp;#39;s trying to accomplish then partner</text>
  <text start="3312.59" dur="6.96">with him and pray into those things if</text>
  <text start="3315.07" dur="6.52">you are a throne room intercessor go</text>
  <text start="3319.55" dur="4.68">into the throne room and do your</text>
  <text start="3321.59" dur="7.29">intercession go and do what you gotta do</text>
  <text start="3324.23" dur="8.91">okay the other thing that he saw in this</text>
  <text start="3328.88" dur="7.26">dream and second scene was there is a</text>
  <text start="3333.14" dur="6.53">message that the Holy Spirit wants to</text>
  <text start="3336.14" dur="6.09">give the president and his staff and</text>
  <text start="3339.67" dur="6.67">they&amp;#39;re having a hard time receiving</text>
  <text start="3342.23" dur="8.369">that message the president staff is up</text>
  <text start="3346.34" dur="7.769">against a situation that they do not</text>
  <text start="3350.599" dur="5.371">fully understand they know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3354.109" dur="3.061">an enemy but they don&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="3355.97" dur="3.42">nature of the enemy they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3357.17" dur="5.67">understand the strategic plans of the</text>
  <text start="3359.39" dur="6.6">enemy they need with them president</text>
  <text start="3362.84" dur="7.56">Trump&amp;#39;s staff and cabinet they need</text>
  <text start="3365.99" dur="7.32">wisdom I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure how we can</text>
  <text start="3370.4" dur="4.8">facilitate that but we have to have</text>
  <text start="3373.31" dur="5.19">wisdom we have to have gods are</text>
  <text start="3375.2" dur="5.1">considered a okay if they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="3378.5" dur="2.88">God&amp;#39;s heart if they don&amp;#39;t have his mind</text>
  <text start="3380.3" dur="2.22">and if they don&amp;#39;t understand what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3381.38" dur="3.719">trying to accomplish short they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3382.52" dur="5.46">understand the nature of the opposition</text>
  <text start="3385.099" dur="5.431">that&amp;#39;s coming against them they they can</text>
  <text start="3387.98" dur="5.97">they can work out of their flesh they</text>
  <text start="3390.53" dur="6.089">can wore out of their their natural</text>
  <text start="3393.95" dur="4.23">understanding of how things look but</text>
  <text start="3396.619" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s not going to accomplish what God</text>
  <text start="3398.18" dur="5.79">wants to get done I would suggest that</text>
  <text start="3401.869" dur="6.771">we start praying if you&amp;#39;re not already</text>
  <text start="3403.97" dur="7.86">that leave Bannon Kellyanne dr. Carson</text>
  <text start="3408.64" dur="7.03">rights previous the president that they</text>
  <text start="3411.83" dur="6.33">would all have an encounter with the</text>
  <text start="3415.67" dur="4.74">Holy Spirit but they would all start to</text>
  <text start="3418.16" dur="6.92">hear his voice more clearly that they</text>
  <text start="3420.41" dur="7.199">would be the lead by the Lord through</text>
  <text start="3425.08" dur="6.13">angelic revelation so you&amp;#39;re hearing his</text>
  <text start="3427.609" dur="6.081">voice through visitations whatever that</text>
  <text start="3431.21" dur="5.85">takes I think we really need to</text>
  <text start="3433.69" dur="5.98">intercede for the White House staff</text>
  <text start="3437.06" dur="5.07">so that they will understand what the</text>
  <text start="3439.67" dur="5.16">nature is of the opposition and the</text>

  <text start="3444.83" dur="3.66">the kingdom they need a revelation they</text>
