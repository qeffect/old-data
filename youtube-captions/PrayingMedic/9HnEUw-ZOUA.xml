  <text start="156.54" dur="6.12">of things I&amp;#39;d like to teach this morning</text>
  <text start="158.57" dur="6.97">Matthew chapter 10 Jesus chooses the</text>
  <text start="162.66" dur="5.48">twelve disciples what&amp;#39;s the first thing</text>
  <text start="165.54" dur="5.01">he does after he chooses the disciples</text>
  <text start="168.14" dur="4.33">he took him into a school of</text>
  <text start="170.55" dur="3.36">supernatural ministry for six weeks and</text>
  <text start="172.47" dur="6.36">taught them about healing and miracles</text>
  <text start="173.91" dur="8">right no he said go out and heal the</text>
  <text start="178.83" dur="6.14">sick raise the dead cast out demons</text>
  <text start="181.91" dur="5.89">cleanse the lepers proclaim the kingdom</text>
  <text start="184.97" dur="5.76">so those are the things that he told the</text>
  <text start="187.8" dur="6.06">disciples to do and guess what they did</text>
  <text start="190.73" dur="5.83">they went out and they raised the dead</text>
  <text start="193.86" dur="3.18">healed people cast out demons cleanse</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="2.45">lepers</text>
  <text start="197.04" dur="4.14">they went out and just did the miracles</text>
  <text start="199.01" dur="4.42">without a whole lot of Education</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="5.34">actually he said I&amp;#39;m sending you out to</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="7.65">the cities before me the cities that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="206.52" dur="9.469">going to you are going before me they</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="4.909">were forerunners they had no training</text>
  <text start="217.25" dur="6.459">they came back and reported the miracles</text>
  <text start="221.1" dur="5.699">and that Lord even demons are subject to</text>
  <text start="223.709" dur="4.801">us in your name we saw many miracles all</text>
  <text start="226.799" dur="3.271">these great things and Lord said do not</text>
  <text start="228.51" dur="2.729">rejoice that the demons are subject to</text>
  <text start="230.07" dur="5.09">you rejoice your names are written in</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="6.991">heaven right okay it was such a popular</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="5.98">model of ministry he sent out seventy</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="5.46">Luke chapter 10 so he sends out the</text>
  <text start="241.14" dur="6.27">seventy same thing go out heal the sick</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="6.92">cast out demons that&amp;#39;s kind of the model</text>
  <text start="247.41" dur="7.41">that the church is supposed to be at</text>
  <text start="250.61" dur="9.189">least in the Gospels we haven&amp;#39;t turned</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="7.5">it into something else we have I mean</text>
  <text start="259.799" dur="4.171">you know we&amp;#39;re gathering in buildings on</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="3.69">there every weekend and do people go out</text>
  <text start="263.97" dur="5.91">and get healed and get delivered of</text>
  <text start="266.01" dur="5.61">demons and we&amp;#39;re changing that this</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="3.27">school is training and equipping you</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="4.35">guys to go and do that stuff that Jesus</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="4.26">told you to do right in this class</text>
  <text start="275.97" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re going to learn</text>
  <text start="277.41" dur="4.5">how to heal a sick how to cast out</text>
  <text start="279.69" dur="4.53">demons you will hopefully learn how to</text>
  <text start="281.91" dur="4.05">do emotional healing next semester if</text>
  <text start="284.22" dur="4.26">you don&amp;#39;t know much about that you look</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="8.76">you will learn I will probably be coming</text>
  <text start="288.48" dur="8.73">back to do emotional that&amp;#39;s physical</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="4.98">healing is great but what I&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="297.21" dur="5.49">over the last few years is many times</text>
  <text start="299.7" dur="4.65">what we think it requires a physical</text>
  <text start="302.7" dur="5.16">healing issue it&amp;#39;s actually an emotional</text>
  <text start="304.35" dur="6.18">healing issue and when you get the</text>
  <text start="307.86" dur="4.92">emotional trauma healed the neck pain</text>
  <text start="310.53" dur="5.94">and the back pain magically disappears</text>
  <text start="312.78" dur="7.22">I&amp;#39;ve seen that a bunch of times so here</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="6.6">is here&amp;#39;s the big question if Jesus said</text>
  <text start="320" dur="5.67">those who believe in me will do the</text>
  <text start="323.07" dur="5.79">works that I do and greater works</text>
  <text start="325.67" dur="6.16">because I go to my father why aren&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="5.9">doing the greater works what are we</text>
  <text start="331.83" dur="5.7">missing well here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re missing</text>
  <text start="334.76" dur="4.96">even in the charismatic and Pentecostal</text>
  <text start="337.53" dur="3.6">church where we believe in the gifts of</text>
  <text start="339.72" dur="3.11">the Spirit and we believe in healing and</text>
  <text start="341.13" dur="6.87">miracles and we believe in deliverance</text>
  <text start="342.83" dur="7.66">we have segmented our ministry into well</text>
  <text start="348" dur="4.29">she is a deliverance minister and she</text>
  <text start="350.49" dur="3.96">has an anointing for in her healing and</text>
  <text start="352.29" dur="4.68">she&amp;#39;s really got a back pain anointing</text>
  <text start="354.45" dur="4.08">and this person over here is really good</text>
  <text start="356.97" dur="4.2">with words of knowledge everybody has a</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="6.9">specialty it&amp;#39;s not how it&amp;#39;s supposed to</text>
  <text start="361.17" dur="6.72">be everyone should know how to cast out</text>
  <text start="365.43" dur="5.34">demons everyone should know how to do</text>
  <text start="367.89" dur="5.25">physical healing everyone should have a</text>
  <text start="370.77" dur="4.26">10-minute program for emotional healing</text>
  <text start="373.14" dur="3.15">I have one I can teach it to you in 10</text>
  <text start="375.03" dur="3.51">minutes and you can teach it to your</text>
  <text start="376.29" dur="4.77">neighbor tomorrow you don&amp;#39;t have to take</text>
  <text start="378.54" dur="5.96">a ten week class on emotional healing</text>
  <text start="381.06" dur="3.44">very simple</text>
  <text start="384.509" dur="4.951">the Lord showed it to me and I use it in</text>
  <text start="386.699" dur="4.261">the ambulance and I have 15 minutes on</text>
  <text start="389.46" dur="3.15">the way to the hospital in addition to</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="3.62">vitals and starting an IV and I can get</text>
  <text start="392.61" dur="5.639">people emotionally healed in ten minutes</text>
  <text start="394.58" dur="9.699">there is no reason why y&amp;#39;all shouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="398.249" dur="8.97">be doing all of this stuff okay that the</text>
  <text start="404.279" dur="6.06">problem is the Lord has given us this</text>
  <text start="407.219" dur="5.85">workshop full of tools we have walked</text>
  <text start="410.339" dur="5.371">over found a hammer and thought I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="413.069" dur="4.38">really good with this hammer I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="415.71" dur="3.6">need the screwdriver the plier the drill</text>
  <text start="417.449" dur="4.53">the band side I got my hammer and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="419.31" dur="4.65">all I mean I&amp;#39;m a hammer specialist and a</text>
  <text start="421.979" dur="5.78">hammer everything and if your only tool</text>
  <text start="423.96" dur="8.789">is a hammer everything looks like a nail</text>
  <text start="427.759" dur="6.94">so when people need healing and to be</text>
  <text start="432.749" dur="4.44">set free if your only tool is</text>
  <text start="434.699" dur="5.28">deliverance you are going to cast a</text>
  <text start="437.189" dur="4.98">demon out of every person every cat</text>
  <text start="439.979" dur="3.631">every brick and every piece of pizza</text>
  <text start="442.169" dur="3.75">that you eat there&amp;#39;s demons and</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="5.549">everything I&amp;#39;m not saying demons aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="445.919" dur="4.73">an issue but if deliverance is the only</text>
  <text start="449.159" dur="5.51">thing you know how to do you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="450.649" dur="7.121">not see a lot of people set free if</text>
  <text start="454.669" dur="6.49">physical healing is the only thing you</text>
  <text start="457.77" dur="3.78">really know how to do you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="461.159" dur="3.66">struggle</text>
  <text start="461.55" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;ll get 40 50 60 % of the people</text>
  <text start="464.819" dur="3.27">healed and the other ones aren&amp;#39;t going</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="2.669">to get healed because they need</text>
  <text start="468.089" dur="5.341">deliverance they need emotional healing</text>
  <text start="469.439" dur="7.53">they need other things what I hope you</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="6.959">learn in this school is to have a tool</text>
  <text start="476.969" dur="7.771">belt that has all kinds of tools on it</text>
  <text start="480.389" dur="7.89">and you learn the tool that&amp;#39;s best for</text>
  <text start="484.74" dur="7.5">that particular situation when Jesus</text>
  <text start="488.279" dur="6.06">went around healing people he said the</text>
  <text start="492.24" dur="8.25">Sun only does what he sees the father</text>
  <text start="494.339" dur="10.021">doing the son of man who is in heaven so</text>
  <text start="500.49" dur="6.719">he was on earth and in heaven he was in</text>
  <text start="504.36" dur="6.869">communication with the father at all</text>
  <text start="507.209" dur="7.2">times one with a father and when he came</text>
  <text start="511.229" dur="4.72">upon a blind man he said father what are</text>
  <text start="514.409" dur="3.31">we going to do with this blind man</text>
  <text start="515.949" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re having the conversation up there</text>
  <text start="517.719" dur="7.05">and the father says take some spit make</text>
  <text start="520.809" dur="5.911">some mud put it in his eye and the son</text>
  <text start="524.769" dur="3.63">says it&amp;#39;s not what we did last time and</text>
  <text start="526.72" dur="9.289">the father says that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="528.399" dur="9.9">this time next time it&amp;#39;ll be different</text>
  <text start="536.009" dur="4.81">next time it&amp;#39;ll be go washing the pool</text>
  <text start="538.299" dur="4.37">time after that&amp;#39;ll be go to the temple</text>
  <text start="540.819" dur="5.49">and show yourself to the priest</text>
  <text start="542.669" dur="6.061">different every time because Jesus was</text>
  <text start="546.309" dur="4.68">constantly in contact with the father</text>
  <text start="548.73" dur="4.859">knew the mind of the Father and knew</text>
  <text start="550.989" dur="8.491">specifically what to do in each case</text>
  <text start="553.589" dur="8.8">which requires revelatory gifts words of</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="4.709">knowledge so we&amp;#39;re in worship and the</text>
  <text start="562.389" dur="4.021">Lord shows me a picture of her and he</text>
  <text start="564.189" dur="5.58">shows me a word in my mind that says</text>
  <text start="566.41" dur="6.449">neck pain it&amp;#39;s that simple he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="569.769" dur="7.26">show me how to get her healed yet</text>

  <text start="582.16" dur="3.719">a minute if I could so everyone can see</text>
  <text start="583.54" dur="7.919">a little bit better actually what I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="585.879" dur="8.76">do is if it&amp;#39;s all right do these yeah go</text>
  <text start="591.459" dur="6.41">I&amp;#39;m gonna have you sit here so we know</text>

  <text start="607.269" dur="7.62">word that I saw so the Lord showed me</text>
  <text start="612.04" dur="6.239">neck pain and then I saw the word</text>
  <text start="614.889" dur="5.37">fibromyalgia look anyone can do this</text>

  <text start="620.259" dur="6.151">closed and the Lord shows me just this</text>
  <text start="622.72" dur="5.819">image of her with the little tinted hair</text>
  <text start="626.41" dur="3.69">and everything and the red shirt and</text>

  <text start="634.779" dur="6.77">going to get her healed there are</text>
  <text start="637.35" dur="7.209">multiple ways that you can do this but</text>
  <text start="641.549" dur="6.01">it generally requires some very specific</text>
  <text start="644.559" dur="4.311">things let me talk about power real</text>
  <text start="647.559" dur="6.15">quick</text>
  <text start="648.87" dur="7.6">power is energy you grab onto a</text>
  <text start="653.709" dur="3.87">high-voltage power line and you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="656.47" dur="3.929">to feel a whole lot of energy going</text>
  <text start="657.579" dur="6.391">through you lots of voltage and lots of</text>
  <text start="660.399" dur="9">amperage power is energy energy is power</text>
  <text start="663.97" dur="13.919">and we use power to heal sickness and</text>
  <text start="669.399" dur="12.69">disease okay so do Reiki healers okay</text>
  <text start="677.889" dur="6.95">energy workers here&amp;#39;s the thing power</text>
  <text start="682.089" dur="5.97">and energy throughout our universe</text>
  <text start="684.839" dur="7.99">everyone has access to it not just</text>
  <text start="688.059" dur="7.291">Christians so how do when jesus said</text>
  <text start="692.829" dur="6.24">they will do with lying signs and</text>
  <text start="695.35" dur="8.07">wonders how do people do lying signs and</text>
  <text start="699.069" dur="6.87">wonders they&amp;#39;re using power to show</text>
  <text start="703.42" dur="4.969">miracles signs and wonders but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="705.939" dur="4.44">doing it for the kingdom of darkness</text>
  <text start="708.389" dur="6.61">because the kingdom of darkness has</text>
  <text start="710.379" dur="8.55">access to power so do we so jesus said</text>
  <text start="714.999" dur="5.94">Acts chapter 1 after he was resurrected</text>
  <text start="718.929" dur="5.611">ready to go ascended to heaven he said</text>

  <text start="1080.799" dur="5.46">primary thing that the Lord wanted me to</text>
  <text start="1082.749" dur="8.67">do was to introduce them to his presence</text>

  <text start="1091.419" dur="5.61">bring your presence let them feel your</text>

  <text start="1408.42" dur="6.48">some of you</text>
  <text start="1409.11" dur="8.37">in 2010 I had a dream and in the dream I</text>
  <text start="1414.9" dur="5.63">was with two of my very good friends and</text>
  <text start="1417.48" dur="5.67">we were being picked up physically and</text>
  <text start="1420.53" dur="6.43">translocated to different places around</text>
  <text start="1423.15" dur="6.15">the United States we would go there we</text>
  <text start="1426.96" dur="4.32">would be told things and experience</text>
  <text start="1429.3" dur="4.59">things and then we would get together</text>
  <text start="1431.28" dur="4.29">and compare and like notes about what we</text>
  <text start="1433.89" dur="3.45">were told and what happened and then we</text>
  <text start="1435.57" dur="4.38">would be picked up as a group and move</text>
  <text start="1437.34" dur="3.96">someplace else and then we&amp;#39;d have our</text>
  <text start="1439.95" dur="3.45">little experience and be picked up and</text>
  <text start="1441.3" dur="3.96">move someplace else one of the places I</text>
  <text start="1443.4" dur="4.909">went was Boston I actually went to</text>
  <text start="1445.26" dur="10.799">Fenway Park to watch a baseball game</text>
  <text start="1448.309" dur="10.091">sorry that was my first revelation about</text>
  <text start="1456.059" dur="3.991">traveling in the spirit I had no</text>
  <text start="1458.4" dur="4.32">understanding of traveling the spirit up</text>
  <text start="1460.05" dur="5.04">until 2010 the Lord gave me that dream</text>
  <text start="1462.72" dur="5.91">then I was like what in the world does</text>
  <text start="1465.09" dur="5.19">this mean so then I started connecting</text>
  <text start="1468.63" dur="4.049">with people who have actually done this</text>
  <text start="1470.28" dur="4.26">stuff and there&amp;#39;s a lot more of them</text>
  <text start="1472.679" dur="3.481">than you might imagine and most of you</text>
  <text start="1474.54" dur="4.11">have probably traveled in the spirit and</text>
  <text start="1476.16" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t know it at least during dreams or</text>
  <text start="1478.65" dur="3.68">envisions or in worship if you&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="1480.48" dur="4.74">seen the throne room of God</text>
  <text start="1482.33" dur="5.47">you&amp;#39;ve traveled in the spirit you may</text>
  <text start="1485.22" dur="5.04">think it&amp;#39;s just something I saw in my</text>

  <text start="1781.11" dur="5.88">want to talk to you about but first I</text>
  <text start="1784.38" dur="4.799">would like to talk about traveling in</text>
  <text start="1786.99" dur="4.2">the spirit because in order to use the</text>
  <text start="1789.179" dur="3.181">next tool which is a court of heaven you</text>
  <text start="1791.19" dur="4.44">have to understand a little bit about</text>
  <text start="1792.36" dur="5.699">traveling in the spirit if I was making</text>
  <text start="1795.63" dur="3.99">no progress with her the next thing I</text>
  <text start="1798.059" dur="3.181">would do is I would go to the court of</text>
  <text start="1799.62" dur="4.14">heaven and find out if there was an</text>
  <text start="1801.24" dur="5.85">accuser there that had something against</text>
  <text start="1803.76" dur="4.71">her that was causing this to remain talk</text>
  <text start="1807.09" dur="3.719">about that in a minute let me let me</text>
  <text start="1808.47" dur="5.43">just give you some biblical background</text>
  <text start="1810.809" dur="7.021">of where we&amp;#39;re going with this the Bible</text>
  <text start="1813.9" dur="5.58">says in Ephesians those in Christ have</text>
  <text start="1817.83" dur="3.14">been blessed with all spiritual</text>
  <text start="1819.48" dur="8.1">blessings in the heavenly places</text>
  <text start="1820.97" dur="9.43">Ephesians 1:3 God made us alive together</text>
  <text start="1827.58" dur="7.729">with Christ and has seated us in</text>
  <text start="1830.4" dur="9.149">heavenly places Ephesians 2:5 through 6</text>
  <text start="1835.309" dur="7.721">the wisdom of God is manifested by us</text>
  <text start="1839.549" dur="6.421">the church to the principalities and</text>
  <text start="1843.03" dur="8.01">powers of darkness in the heavenly</text>
  <text start="1845.97" dur="6.69">places and we wage war against all the</text>
  <text start="1851.04" dur="2.34">various powers of darkness in the</text>
  <text start="1852.66" dur="3.69">heavenly places</text>
  <text start="1853.38" dur="6.27">confusion 6:12 the whole book of</text>
  <text start="1856.35" dur="6.44">Ephesians is like a strategy manual for</text>
  <text start="1859.65" dur="5.19">spiritual warfare it&amp;#39;s a lot of good</text>
  <text start="1862.79" dur="4.53">revelation about spiritual warfare but</text>
  <text start="1864.84" dur="5.79">which I&amp;#39;ve noticed is a lot of this</text>
  <text start="1867.32" dur="6.7">refers to doing warfare in the heavenly</text>
  <text start="1870.63" dur="7.71">places for years we&amp;#39;ve been down here on</text>
  <text start="1874.02" dur="6.51">earth aiming our guns up into the</text>
  <text start="1878.34" dur="3.959">atmosphere above us trying to shoot that</text>
  <text start="1880.53" dur="6.96">at the principalities and powers of</text>
  <text start="1882.299" dur="9.391">darkness and they&amp;#39;re above us probably a</text>
  <text start="1887.49" dur="6">better strategy is for us to go into the</text>
  <text start="1891.69" dur="4.68">throne room for us to go into the</text>
  <text start="1893.49" dur="6.48">heavenly realms and do our warfare from</text>
  <text start="1896.37" dur="7.95">there or we&amp;#39;re above them where we are</text>
  <text start="1899.97" dur="6.959">seated with Christ in heavenly places to</text>
  <text start="1904.32" dur="5.04">give you an example of that many times</text>
  <text start="1906.929" dur="6.061">when I&amp;#39;m praying for someone</text>
  <text start="1909.36" dur="6.6">to be healed of cancer and I rarely see</text>
  <text start="1912.99" dur="6.03">this with anything except cancer and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1915.96" dur="5.22">not teaching this as a doctrine this is</text>
  <text start="1919.02" dur="5.55">something the Lord showed me he may show</text>
  <text start="1921.18" dur="6.18">you something else many times that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1924.57" dur="3.48">praying for cancer when I have my eyes</text>
  <text start="1927.36" dur="5.85">closed</text>
  <text start="1928.05" dur="7.14">I&amp;#39;ll see in my mind a throne and the</text>
  <text start="1933.21" dur="4.89">first time I saw it I thought well what</text>
  <text start="1935.19" dur="5.6">does that mean and he said you&amp;#39;re seated</text>
  <text start="1938.1" dur="9.86">with me in heavenly places on a throne</text>
  <text start="1940.79" dur="7.17">so he said act like a king or an emperor</text>
  <text start="1948.02" dur="6.04">because an emperor is a king of kings</text>
  <text start="1950.25" dur="7.77">and Jesus is an emperor he is the king</text>
  <text start="1954.06" dur="9.42">of kings lord of lords right he is the</text>
  <text start="1958.02" dur="8.78">Emperor but we can operate and function</text>
  <text start="1963.48" dur="6.09">in the same things that he functions in</text>
  <text start="1966.8" dur="7.03">so if you look in the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="1969.57" dur="7.02">you&amp;#39;ll learn that Kings would take their</text>
  <text start="1973.83" dur="6">troops and go out to battle in the</text>
  <text start="1976.59" dur="5.07">spring and do fight wars but if you know</text>
  <text start="1979.83" dur="4.35">anything about emperors emperors don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1981.66" dur="6.72">go and do battle Emperor&amp;#39;s stay on their</text>
  <text start="1984.18" dur="6.57">throne and they make decrees and those</text>
  <text start="1988.38" dur="3.63">who serve the Emperor&amp;#39;s make their</text>
  <text start="1990.75" dur="3.48">decrees come to pass</text>
  <text start="1992.01" dur="4.77">Emperor&amp;#39;s don&amp;#39;t engage the enemy they</text>
  <text start="1994.23" dur="5.52">stay on their throne so the Lord showed</text>
  <text start="1996.78" dur="6.27">me was when I show you a throne I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1999.75" dur="5.54">want you engaging in warfare or even</text>
  <text start="2003.05" dur="5.64">engage it using releasing power are</text>
  <text start="2005.29" dur="8.25">using Authority I want you to simply</text>
  <text start="2008.69" dur="8.31">make a decree and let it go nothing else</text>
  <text start="2013.54" dur="7.12">so I started doing that when I would see</text>
  <text start="2017" dur="6.78">a throne typically when I was praying</text>
  <text start="2020.66" dur="4.83">for cancer I would simply declare when</text>
  <text start="2023.78" dur="3.69">this person goes to the doctor and has</text>
  <text start="2025.49" dur="6.36">your neck skin they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="2027.47" dur="6.15">healed that&amp;#39;s it done most of the people</text>
  <text start="2031.85" dur="5.88">that I prayed for that way have cancer</text>
  <text start="2033.62" dur="7.29">have been healed it&amp;#39;s very similar to</text>
  <text start="2037.73" dur="4.56">when Jesus told the paralytic pick up</text>
  <text start="2040.91" dur="6.54">your mat and walk</text>
  <text start="2042.29" dur="10">did he touch him did he release power</text>
  <text start="2047.45" dur="8.86">did he cast out a demon he gave him a</text>
  <text start="2052.29" dur="9.089">command which he could not obey unless</text>
  <text start="2056.31" dur="8.97">he was healed okay so he simply said</text>
  <text start="2061.379" dur="7.081">pick up your mat and walk and in order</text>
  <text start="2065.28" dur="6.599">for that command to happen he had to be</text>
  <text start="2068.46" dur="6.78">healed so he got healed picks up his mat</text>
  <text start="2071.879" dur="5.401">and starts walking it&amp;#39;s making a</text>
  <text start="2075.24" dur="5.73">declaration about what is going to</text>
  <text start="2077.28" dur="8.31">happen crawl into things which are not</text>
  <text start="2080.97" dur="7.169">as if they&amp;#39;re when I do that and I see</text>
  <text start="2085.59" dur="4.86">the throat I believe my spirit is</text>
  <text start="2088.139" dur="5.941">actually on that throne making a</text>
  <text start="2090.45" dur="4.469">declaration traveling in the spirit even</text>
  <text start="2094.08" dur="3.9">though I&amp;#39;m just sitting at my computer</text>
  <text start="2094.919" dur="6.391">desk and I don&amp;#39;t sense like my spirit is</text>
  <text start="2097.98" dur="5.31">left my body what I&amp;#39;ve come to learn is</text>
  <text start="2101.31" dur="5.28">something there&amp;#39;s a dynamic there where</text>
  <text start="2103.29" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;m actually operating from my seat in</text>
  <text start="2106.59" dur="4.58">heaven that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m operating from</text>
  <text start="2108.33" dur="5.61">in that situation all right</text>
  <text start="2111.17" dur="4.6">biblical basis for traveling in the</text>
  <text start="2113.94" dur="3.06">spirit I&amp;#39;m going to give you we&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="2115.77" dur="3.54">going to go through some Old Testament</text>
  <text start="2117" dur="8">and some New Testament Scriptures first</text>
  <text start="2119.31" dur="10.29">Kings eighteen eleven and twelve</text>
  <text start="2125" dur="9.37">interesting story here so Elijah meets</text>

  <text start="2328.49" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s a traitor or a spy so he asked</text>

  <text start="2428.93" dur="5.85">chapter 6 I&amp;#39;m just no backstory I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="2432.41" dur="6.75">going to read it other than to tell you</text>
  <text start="2434.78" dur="7.23">the Sea of Galilee is 9 miles across now</text>
  <text start="2439.16" dur="4.74">when evening came the disciples went</text>
  <text start="2442.01" dur="3.96">down to the sea into the boat and it</text>
  <text start="2443.9" dur="3.93">went over the sea toward Capernaum and</text>
  <text start="2445.97" dur="4.68">it was already dark and Jesus had not</text>
  <text start="2447.83" dur="4.95">yet come to them when the seat then the</text>
  <text start="2450.65" dur="4.2">sea arose and a great wind was blowing</text>
  <text start="2452.78" dur="4.89">so when they had rowed about three or</text>
  <text start="2454.85" dur="4.8">four miles they saw Jesus walking on the</text>
  <text start="2457.67" dur="3.84">sea and drawing near the boat and they</text>
  <text start="2459.65" dur="5.31">were afraid but he said to them do not</text>
  <text start="2461.51" dur="5.57">be afraid it is I so they gladly</text>
  <text start="2464.96" dur="5.22">received him into the boat and</text>
  <text start="2467.08" dur="8.23">immediately the boat was at land where</text>
  <text start="2470.18" dur="7.26">they were going they rowed three or four</text>
  <text start="2475.31" dur="6.06">miles so there in the middle of the sea</text>
  <text start="2477.44" dur="5.49">he gets in the boat and immediately the</text>
  <text start="2481.37" dur="6.09">whole group of disciples were</text>
  <text start="2482.93" dur="6.81">translocated supernaturally 5 6 miles</text>
  <text start="2487.46" dur="4.77">which is interesting because the very</text>
  <text start="2489.74" dur="4.5">first dream I had about spiritual travel</text>
  <text start="2492.23" dur="6.24">me and my friends were traveling as a</text>
  <text start="2494.24" dur="8.73">group really well-known verse Acts</text>
  <text start="2498.47" dur="7.86">chapter 8 verses 38 through 40 there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2502.97" dur="4.83">this Ethiopian eunuch and he&amp;#39;s in a</text>
  <text start="2506.33" dur="4.65">chariot and he&amp;#39;s reading the scroll of</text>
  <text start="2507.8" dur="5.4">Isaiah and the Lord says to him go catch</text>
  <text start="2510.98" dur="5.07">up to the eunuch and join yourself with</text>
  <text start="2513.2" dur="5.04">him so he does and Philip says to the</text>
  <text start="2516.05" dur="4.14">eunuch do you understand who you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2518.24" dur="4.23">reading about and he says no I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2520.19" dur="5.28">understand Who am I who is speaking of</text>
  <text start="2522.47" dur="6.51">and so Philip says he&amp;#39;s speaking about</text>
  <text start="2525.47" dur="5.64">the Messiah who has already come and the</text>
  <text start="2528.98" dur="5.58">eunuch becomes a believer and says hey</text>
  <text start="2531.11" dur="5.7">can I be baptized so so he commanded the</text>
  <text start="2534.56" dur="3.769">chariot to stand still both Philip and</text>
  <text start="2536.81" dur="3.889">the eunuch went down in the water</text>
  <text start="2538.329" dur="3.75">he baptized him and when they came up</text>
  <text start="2540.699" dur="3.78">out of the water the Spirit of the Lord</text>
  <text start="2542.079" dur="4.86">caught Philip away so that the eunuch</text>
  <text start="2544.479" dur="5.64">saw him no more but he went on his way</text>
  <text start="2546.939" dur="5.82">rejoicing and Philip was found at Zota</text>
  <text start="2550.119" dur="3.93">s&amp;#39; passing through he preached at all</text>
  <text start="2552.759" dur="3.93">the cities until they came to Caesarea</text>
  <text start="2554.049" dur="5.52">so Philip supernaturally transported</text>
  <text start="2556.689" dur="7.38">dropped off which brings us to the book</text>

  <text start="2575.559" dur="3.24">to the churches of Asia and you could</text>
  <text start="2577.089" dur="3.39">argue that those were also revelation</text>
  <text start="2578.799" dur="3.93">that John received in the spiritual</text>

  <text start="3440.849" dur="4.331">then it says the court was seated and</text>
  <text start="3443.859" dur="4.26">the books were opened</text>
  <text start="3445.18" dur="4.04">that&amp;#39;s an illustration of what what</text>
  <text start="3448.119" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about here</text>
  <text start="3449.22" dur="7.27">when I had this fever and I saw in my</text>
  <text start="3453.339" dur="4.44">mind what looked like a courtroom I had</text>
  <text start="3456.49" dur="2.549">I had a little bit of information</text>
  <text start="3457.779" dur="4.111">because I had been listening to some</text>
  <text start="3459.039" dur="4.921">messages and I knew if you&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="3461.89" dur="4.919">court you need to have your accuser you</text>
  <text start="3463.96" dur="5.34">need to hear what the accusation is so I</text>
  <text start="3466.809" dur="3.991">asked for my accuser to be present</text>
  <text start="3469.3" dur="3.39">and I saw something that literally</text>
  <text start="3470.8" dur="4.41">looked like a like a rolling ball of</text>
  <text start="3472.69" dur="4.41">dirt this swirling ball of dirt came up</text>
  <text start="3475.21" dur="4.77">and appeared next to me to the right and</text>
  <text start="3477.1" dur="5.07">as I looked at it in my mind it was to</text>
  <text start="3479.98" dur="6.48">the right of me I saw all these</text>
  <text start="3482.17" dur="5.55">accusations murderer adulterer liar so</text>
  <text start="3486.46" dur="4.08">what do you do when you&amp;#39;re being accused</text>
  <text start="3487.72" dur="4.89">in the court heaven well Joshua didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3490.54" dur="8.54">dispute and didn&amp;#39;t argue with his</text>
  <text start="3492.61" dur="10.17">accuser right Matthew 5 verse 26 says</text>
  <text start="3499.08" dur="6.4">agree with your adversary quickly while</text>
  <text start="3502.78" dur="5.31">you are on the way with him lest he turn</text>
  <text start="3505.48" dur="4.62">you over to the judge who hands you over</text>
  <text start="3508.09" dur="2.69">to the bailiff and you be thrown in</text>
  <text start="3510.1" dur="3.78">prison</text>
  <text start="3510.78" dur="6.16">so what Jesus was teaching there is</text>
  <text start="3513.88" dur="7.98">don&amp;#39;t disabuse your adversary or your</text>
  <text start="3516.94" dur="8.85">accuser I agree with them so I saw the</text>
  <text start="3521.86" dur="5.64">accusations and you know I thought I</text>
  <text start="3525.79" dur="6.66">haven&amp;#39;t actually murdered anybody this</text>
  <text start="3527.5" dur="6.54">week but jesus said if you hate someone</text>
  <text start="3532.45" dur="3.32">in your heart you&amp;#39;ve marked you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3534.04" dur="5.22">guilty of murder right</text>
  <text start="3535.77" dur="6.22">so the accusations are generally true in</text>
  <text start="3539.26" dur="5.88">some sense so it&amp;#39;s not even worth it to</text>
  <text start="3541.99" dur="5.19">dispute or try to argue against them so</text>
  <text start="3545.14" dur="6.9">I said ok your honor I&amp;#39;m guilty as</text>
  <text start="3547.18" dur="7.29">charged but the blood of a lamb slain</text>
  <text start="3552.04" dur="4.14">before the foundation of the world has</text>
  <text start="3554.47" dur="6.21">cleanse me of all unrighteousness</text>
  <text start="3556.18" dur="5.49">removed my sin I know that I know a</text>
  <text start="3560.68" dur="3.24">little bit of the Bible</text>
  <text start="3561.67" dur="3.81">I remember grahamcooke going to the</text>
  <text start="3563.92" dur="3.6">court of heaven the first time and he</text>
  <text start="3565.48" dur="4.77">didn&amp;#39;t know what to do he was standing</text>
  <text start="3567.52" dur="4.08">there in front of this table and he was</text>
  <text start="3570.25" dur="3.6">like Jesus I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3571.6" dur="5.04">supposed to do and an angel comes up to</text>

  <text start="3599.59" dur="3.25">usually is a bunch of accusations</text>
  <text start="3602.29" dur="2.38">against</text>
  <text start="3602.84" dur="4.47">you don&amp;#39;t necessarily have to have the</text>
  <text start="3604.67" dur="5.31">book there sometimes when you appear</text>
  <text start="3607.31" dur="4.53">there the book will already be there so</text>
  <text start="3609.98" dur="4.26">you can ask for it to come if you want</text>
  <text start="3611.84" dur="4.38">all it is doing is it&amp;#39;s going to reveal</text>
  <text start="3614.24" dur="5.9">the accusations against you that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="3616.22" dur="7.23">it is many people when they go there a</text>

  <text start="3632.99" dur="5.15">and she saw a bunch of Klansmen wearing</text>
  <text start="3635.99" dur="4.74">white hoods and they were doing some</text>
  <text start="3638.14" dur="5.17">hideous things and she saw this in her</text>
  <text start="3640.73" dur="5.79">mind in a vision a couple nights ago</text>
  <text start="3643.31" dur="6.36">we&amp;#39;re doing with a woman she saw witches</text>
  <text start="3646.52" dur="4.26">wearing all kinds of crazy garb and they</text>
  <text start="3649.67" dur="4.11">were in this courtroom</text>

  <text start="3661.25" dur="6.3">that the enemy was using against her</text>
  <text start="3662.99" dur="8.91">both of them one woman said she saw a</text>
  <text start="3667.55" dur="6.78">bus like a school bus and it was packed</text>
  <text start="3671.9" dur="4.95">with demons and they were all screaming</text>
  <text start="3674.33" dur="5.43">and accusing her Jesus was standing</text>
  <text start="3676.85" dur="7.17">outside slam the door shut and the bus</text>
  <text start="3679.76" dur="6.84">took off so you may see anything but</text>
  <text start="3684.02" dur="4.02">normally most people will see a demon or</text>
  <text start="3686.6" dur="4.11">two or three or four and they&amp;#39;ll be over</text>
  <text start="3688.04" dur="5.9">there accusing and you know saying bad</text>

  <text start="3698.6" dur="5.52">hear it you may not even see anything</text>
  <text start="3700.15" dur="7.54">but it appears different for everybody</text>
  <text start="3704.12" dur="5.31">but generally speaking you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3707.69" dur="5.58">have someone some things they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3709.43" dur="7.05">accusing you just realize they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="3713.27" dur="4.98">to have accusations if you want you can</text>
  <text start="3716.48" dur="4.32">write them down because there may be</text>
  <text start="3718.25" dur="3.96">things in there you need to repent of so</text>
  <text start="3720.8" dur="3">if you hear the accusation and it</text>
  <text start="3722.21" dur="4.94">involves something like witchcraft or</text>
  <text start="3723.8" dur="5.78">Freemasonry repent of it renounce</text>

  <text start="3734.29" dur="6.6">forgive them okay all that stuff is</text>
  <text start="3737.02" dur="6.96">helpful in my case I saw the book and</text>
  <text start="3740.89" dur="5.37">when I asked when I said I the blood of</text>

  <text start="3746.26" dur="6.06">and makes me it wipes away my sin what</text>
  <text start="3749.92" dur="5.64">happened was I saw I saw the book there</text>

  <text start="3762.25" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ve literally seen blood being poured</text>
  <text start="3764.23" dur="4.53">on it and then the words were erased I</text>
  <text start="3766.81" dur="3.87">talked to a woman who I was doing</text>
  <text start="3768.76" dur="4.29">deliverance this is kind of interesting</text>
  <text start="3770.68" dur="4.89">she knew nothing about the courts of</text>

  <text start="3777.31" dur="6.21">this demon that was manifesting on her</text>
  <text start="3779.56" dur="5.91">and nothing was working so I thought</text>

  <text start="3785.47" dur="6.21">saw the this demon there she saw Jesus</text>

  <text start="3807.88" dur="5.34">and it had accusations against me in</text>
  <text start="3810.49" dur="6.09">this book there was five accusations and</text>
  <text start="3813.22" dur="5.79">I saw them all so in the court of heaven</text>
  <text start="3816.58" dur="6.27">she sees the same book with the same</text>
  <text start="3819.01" dur="6.66">accusations and she agreed with the</text>
  <text start="3822.85" dur="4.56">accuser allowed the blood of Jesus to</text>
  <text start="3825.67" dur="4.35">beard offense and she said what I saw</text>
  <text start="3827.41" dur="4.95">was Jesus walked over he had blood on</text>

  <text start="4705.9" dur="6">Joshua I will give you authority to walk</text>
  <text start="4709.02" dur="6.3">in my courts among those who are here in</text>
  <text start="4711.9" dur="8.49">the heavens many heavenly courts and as</text>
  <text start="4715.32" dur="8.01">we learn become familiar with the courts</text>
  <text start="4720.39" dur="4.5">we gain authority and responsibility and</text>
  <text start="4723.33" dur="3.81">will eventually do higher and greater</text>
  <text start="4724.89" dur="5.579">things we start walking in governmental</text>
  <text start="4727.14" dur="4.62">authority working in judicial actions</text>
  <text start="4730.469" dur="3.391">and the court of heavens that effect</text>
  <text start="4731.76" dur="4.05">things on earth bringing heaven&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="4733.86" dur="7.91">to earth that&amp;#39;s where all of this is</text>
  <text start="4735.81" dur="5.96">going questions yes ma&amp;#39;am</text>
  <text start="4753.18" dur="4.75">there are different theories on that so</text>
  <text start="4755.83" dur="4.47">Robert Henderson wrote a book operating</text>
  <text start="4757.93" dur="4.77">in the courts heaven Henderson is of the</text>
  <text start="4760.3" dur="5.64">opinion that we should always go to the</text>
  <text start="4762.7" dur="6.54">courts of heaven in every case get</text>
  <text start="4765.94" dur="6.15">heavens view get the legal things</text>
  <text start="4769.24" dur="4.83">precedent set in place and the documents</text>
  <text start="4772.09" dur="5.49">all good to go and then go into our</text>
  <text start="4774.07" dur="5.07">warfare so he has a view that we should</text>
  <text start="4777.58" dur="3.21">always go to the courts of heaven and</text>
  <text start="4779.14" dur="4.32">get the legal issue straightened out and</text>
  <text start="4780.79" dur="4.5">get God&amp;#39;s seal of approval on what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4783.46" dur="5.19">doing I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s practical</text>
  <text start="4785.29" dur="4.92">for me I pray for a lot of people and 70</text>
  <text start="4788.65" dur="4.2">80 % of the time just the releasing</text>
  <text start="4790.21" dur="4.29">power will heal them so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="4792.85" dur="3.93">that it&amp;#39;s always necessary to go to the</text>
  <text start="4794.5" dur="4.98">courts I just have a different view I I</text>
  <text start="4796.78" dur="5.55">tend to use the courts when something</text>
  <text start="4799.48" dur="5.28">else isn&amp;#39;t working try this try that try</text>
  <text start="4802.33" dur="4.64">that try that and then go to this yes</text>
  <text start="4804.76" dur="2.21">ma&amp;#39;am</text>
  <text start="4812.21" dur="15.69">I I&amp;#39;m going to be honest when it comes</text>
  <text start="4824.93" dur="4.92">to families and generational lines I do</text>
  <text start="4827.9" dur="4.02">not have a lot of revelation on that</text>
  <text start="4829.85" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s just not something the Lord has</text>
  <text start="4831.92" dur="4.68">given me much information on I have a</text>
  <text start="4834.08" dur="4.92">lot of friends who are very big into</text>
  <text start="4836.6" dur="4.83">cleansing bloodlines generational curses</text>
  <text start="4839" dur="3.989">removing all that stuff that&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="4841.43" dur="3.3">they have much more experience and</text>
  <text start="4842.989" dur="4.381">knowledge I don&amp;#39;t know much about that I</text>
  <text start="4844.73" dur="4.65">very seldom to operate and that sort of</text>
  <text start="4847.37" dur="3.96">thing because the Lord just doesn&amp;#39;t very</text>
  <text start="4849.38" dur="3.99">often have me doing that he has me doing</text>
  <text start="4851.33" dur="15.659">other things so I unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4853.37" dur="14.4">know sorry we are part of but not all of</text>
  <text start="4866.989" dur="3.271">them are saved</text>
  <text start="4867.77" dur="6.09">I you know what I would like to know how</text>
  <text start="4870.26" dur="10.53">to pray in a general sense for the</text>
  <text start="4873.86" dur="13.98">nation can we ok I didn&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="4880.79" dur="11.37">this but there are many courts and</text>
  <text start="4887.84" dur="8.73">councils in heaven one of them is what</text>
  <text start="4892.16" dur="6.75">we call the divine council you can see</text>
  <text start="4896.57" dur="5.88">it in the Sanhedrin Council the</text>
  <text start="4898.91" dur="8.07">Sanhedrin Council is modeled after the</text>
  <text start="4902.45" dur="9.24">divine council in heaven it&amp;#39;s a court of</text>
  <text start="4906.98" dur="5.91">elders Saints angels the Lord it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="4911.69" dur="5.73">place where people go and do</text>
  <text start="4912.89" dur="7.95">deliberations you can see it in various</text>
  <text start="4917.42" dur="8.52">places in the scriptures it&amp;#39;s in Psalm</text>
  <text start="4920.84" dur="7.379">82 if you are familiar with when Ahab</text>
  <text start="4925.94" dur="5.72">was going to a talk attack ramoth-gilead</text>
  <text start="4928.219" dur="9.541">and there&amp;#39;s that weird passage where</text>
  <text start="4931.66" dur="9.52">Makia says to a hab I saw this council</text>
  <text start="4937.76" dur="5.82">and the Lord asked his those who are</text>
  <text start="4941.18" dur="4.539">surrounding him who will go and entice a</text>
  <text start="4943.58" dur="4.15">hab to fall at ramoth-gilead</text>
  <text start="4945.719" dur="4.98">and one said this another said that and</text>
  <text start="4947.73" dur="4.8">a lying spirit said I will go and I will</text>
  <text start="4950.699" dur="3.75">entice him and the Lord said how are you</text>
  <text start="4952.53" dur="3.93">going to do it he said I will go and be</text>
  <text start="4954.449" dur="5.941">a lying spirit in the mouth of all of</text>
  <text start="4956.46" dur="4.95">his prophets okay that passage that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4960.39" dur="4.14">the divine counsel</text>
  <text start="4961.41" dur="5.07">so there&amp;#39;s deliberations going on about</text>
  <text start="4964.53" dur="4.32">how things are going to happen now I I</text>
  <text start="4966.48" dur="4.77">got it I received a testimony from a guy</text>
  <text start="4968.85" dur="4.29">in New Zealand he sent it to me through</text>
  <text start="4971.25" dur="3.12">my website and he didn&amp;#39;t know I was</text>
  <text start="4973.14" dur="5.07">writing a book on travelling in the</text>
  <text start="4974.37" dur="7.14">spirit his testimony is all about going</text>
  <text start="4978.21" dur="6.42">to the divine council first to be an</text>
  <text start="4981.51" dur="5.34">observer and then his angel said you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4984.63" dur="3.93">going to observe and you&amp;#39;re in three</text>
  <text start="4986.85" dur="2.82">days I&amp;#39;m going to come back take you to</text>
  <text start="4988.56" dur="4.23">the divine council and you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="4989.67" dur="5.1">submit a petition on behalf of two</text>
  <text start="4992.79" dur="3.9">nations there&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="4994.77" dur="3.36">deliberations and discussions and then</text>
  <text start="4996.69" dur="5.27">the Lord is going to make a ruling on it</text>
  <text start="4998.13" dur="6.06">if you want to be involved in</text>
  <text start="5001.96" dur="4.33">intercession and work for your nations</text>
  <text start="5004.19" dur="4.23">that is taken care of in the divine</text>
  <text start="5006.29" dur="4.8">council that&amp;#39;s my understanding and that</text>
  <text start="5008.42" dur="6.42">is something that we can be invited to</text>
  <text start="5011.09" dur="8.79">go to but most people are not quite</text>
  <text start="5014.84" dur="7.05">ready for that there is an entire</text>
  <text start="5019.88" dur="6.12">chapter in my book on the divine council</text>
  <text start="5021.89" dur="5.97">does that help because the court of</text>
  <text start="5026" dur="3.449">accusation this what I&amp;#39;ve been talking</text>
  <text start="5027.86" dur="4.53">about is the court of accusation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5029.449" dur="5.461">really a very low-level Court and is</text>
  <text start="5032.39" dur="4.079">specific to personal individuals and</text>
  <text start="5034.91" dur="3.48">accusations against them it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5036.469" dur="5.791">really deal with bigger things yes sir</text>
  <text start="5038.39" dur="5.19">all right so as a Christian and go</text>
  <text start="5042.26" dur="2.97">before the Lord on a regular basis</text>
  <text start="5043.58" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;ve asked for forgiveness for things</text>
  <text start="5045.23" dur="5.12">that your world it&amp;#39;s okay but then you</text>
  <text start="5047.9" dur="5.67">get dissemination and not move and so</text>
  <text start="5050.35" dur="6.16">access court of accusation my question</text>
  <text start="5053.57" dur="5.25">is because I agree with all this I use</text>
  <text start="5056.51" dur="3.84">it on a regular basis but my question is</text>
  <text start="5058.82" dur="3.69">how is it that after you&amp;#39;ve asked for</text>
  <text start="5060.35" dur="5.31">forgiveness and that you&amp;#39;re walking in a</text>
  <text start="5062.51" dur="6.57">modality of repentance how is it that</text>
  <text start="5065.66" dur="9.03">the enemy is still there still</text>
  <text start="5069.08" dur="10.139">I don&amp;#39;t know yeah that&amp;#39;s a good question</text>
  <text start="5074.69" dur="7.74">so as far as you know you&amp;#39;re walking in</text>
  <text start="5079.219" dur="5.731">it walking in the spirit in love you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5082.43" dur="4.559">not offending people you&amp;#39;re and the</text>
  <text start="5084.95" dur="6.96">enemy is still coming after your own</text>
  <text start="5086.989" dur="6.181">right my guess is there&amp;#39;s something in</text>
  <text start="5091.91" dur="5.52">your blind spot that you&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="5093.17" dur="6.27">seeing probably if the enemy has some</text>
  <text start="5097.43" dur="4.26">legal grounds against you there is</text>
  <text start="5099.44" dur="4.65">something that you don&amp;#39;t know about this</text>
  <text start="5101.69" dur="4.71">these two women that I won we talked to</text>
  <text start="5104.09" dur="4.74">last night she had no idea that she had</text>
  <text start="5106.4" dur="4.05">a family history of people who are</text>
  <text start="5108.83" dur="3.15">involved in the Ku Klux Klan it had</text>
  <text start="5110.45" dur="4.14">never been talked about in her family</text>
  <text start="5111.98" dur="4.59">and game it just showed up in the court</text>
  <text start="5114.59" dur="3.99">of heaven so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="5116.57" dur="3.96">guessing this probably something you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5118.58" dur="2.67">not aware of and if you go there you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="5120.53" dur="13.14">find out what it is</text>
  <text start="5121.25" dur="16.02">I would I would go to Lourdes on that</text>
