  <text start="8.809" dur="5.29">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="4.88">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="2.571">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="17.3" dur="9.67">how is everyone doing today we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="23.25" dur="8.25">talking about power for healing now we</text>
  <text start="26.97" dur="7.44">are in chapter 8 in my book divine</text>
  <text start="31.5" dur="4.89">healing made simple and chapter 8 is</text>
  <text start="34.41" dur="5.039">power and authority for healing but</text>
  <text start="36.39" dur="5.309">since I wrote the book I have learned so</text>
  <text start="39.449" dur="4.68">much about power and authority I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="41.699" dur="4.171">actually looking at writing a second</text>
  <text start="44.129" dur="3.901">book called power and authority made</text>
  <text start="45.87" dur="5.16">simple I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot about what</text>
  <text start="48.03" dur="4.619">power is and what authority is and how</text>
  <text start="51.03" dur="2.34">they are different and what they can</text>
  <text start="52.649" dur="4.14">accomplish</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="6.18">and what they can&amp;#39;t accomplish so in</text>
  <text start="56.789" dur="5.191">this week&amp;#39;s message I&amp;#39;m just going to</text>
  <text start="59.55" dur="4.829">cover the subject of power for healing</text>
  <text start="61.98" dur="4.71">next week on Saturday I&amp;#39;ll cover the</text>
  <text start="64.379" dur="4.081">subject of authority Freeling in</text>
  <text start="66.69" dur="5.22">miracles and we&amp;#39;ll talk about the</text>
  <text start="68.46" dur="7.909">differences so one of the problems that</text>
  <text start="71.91" dur="6.93">exists in the church among believers is</text>
  <text start="76.369" dur="4.661">there is a there&amp;#39;s a terrible</text>
  <text start="78.84" dur="6.029">misunderstanding about the difference</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="6.72">between power and authority even people</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="4.89">who operate in healing and miracles even</text>
  <text start="87.75" dur="4.05">many of them don&amp;#39;t understand what power</text>
  <text start="89.759" dur="3.571">and authority really are and I&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="91.8" dur="4.44">you an example I got an email this</text>
  <text start="93.33" dur="6.569">morning from a woman who received one of</text>
  <text start="96.24" dur="6.18">my messages I send out updates to people</text>
  <text start="99.899" dur="4.621">who subscribe to my email list and she</text>
  <text start="102.42" dur="5.67">wrote back to me saying hey I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="6.84">been healed I have been proclaiming the</text>
  <text start="108.09" dur="6.479">scriptures and I have been praying in</text>
  <text start="111.36" dur="6.539">tongues what else should I do to receive</text>
  <text start="114.569" dur="5.22">healing so this woman is under the</text>
  <text start="117.899" dur="4.97">impression that speaking the scriptures</text>
  <text start="119.789" dur="6.72">over herself and praying in tongues is</text>
  <text start="122.869" dur="5.59">what she needs to do to be healed I have</text>
  <text start="126.509" dur="3.901">no idea where she got that teaching from</text>
  <text start="128.459" dur="4.681">but there are a lot of messages out</text>
  <text start="130.41" dur="5.49">there on healing where people have just</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="5.849">strange ideas about how you get people</text>
  <text start="135.9" dur="6.6">healed and I take all of my instruction</text>
  <text start="138.989" dur="6.271">either from one of two sources from the</text>
  <text start="142.5" dur="5.46">New Testament mostly because there is</text>
  <text start="145.26" dur="4.72">some good teaching on healing in the Old</text>
  <text start="147.96" dur="4.809">Testament a little bit you can see some</text>
  <text start="149.98" dur="4.679">shadows and types in Sim illustrations</text>
  <text start="152.769" dur="3.091">there&amp;#39;s actually some good illustrations</text>
  <text start="154.659" dur="4.921">of raising the dead in the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="155.86" dur="5.849">but most of the good teaching on healing</text>
  <text start="159.58" dur="4.23">miracles deliverance raising the dead is</text>
  <text start="161.709" dur="4.381">in the New Testament in the Gospels and</text>
  <text start="163.81" dur="5.64">you really have to just focus in on what</text>
  <text start="166.09" dur="5.85">did Jesus do and if you look at what</text>
  <text start="169.45" dur="4.89">Jesus did and you do the things he did</text>
  <text start="171.94" dur="5.04">and you understand what he was doing and</text>
  <text start="174.34" dur="4.229">how he was doing it and and just emulate</text>
  <text start="176.98" dur="4.649">what he was doing you&amp;#39;re gonna have good</text>
  <text start="178.569" dur="5.821">success now in the Gospels I never see</text>
  <text start="181.629" dur="5.881">Jesus speaking in tongues to get someone</text>
  <text start="184.39" dur="5.64">healed I never see him proclaiming the</text>
  <text start="187.51" dur="5.43">the word or reciting scripture verses</text>
  <text start="190.03" dur="7.289">over people who are healed he usually</text>
  <text start="192.94" dur="6.84">either rebuked a spirit touch somebody</text>
  <text start="197.319" dur="4.92">and release power or he gave them a</text>
  <text start="199.78" dur="4.709">command to follow those are the most</text>
  <text start="202.239" dur="4.47">common ways in which jesus healed people</text>
  <text start="204.489" dur="3.72">and that is what has worked for me I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="206.709" dur="3.931">tried a lot of different things over the</text>
  <text start="208.209" dur="4.351">years to get people healed and the</text>
  <text start="210.64" dur="3.36">things that Jesus did are actually the</text>
  <text start="212.56" dur="6.899">things that work really well for me I</text>
  <text start="214" dur="8.25">know that&amp;#39;s gonna shock you but the long</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="5.25">and the short of it is if you want to</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="6.63">see healing in miracles do what Jesus</text>
  <text start="224.709" dur="7.411">did okay so power and authority are</text>
  <text start="228.88" dur="5.1">different they are different concepts</text>
  <text start="232.12" dur="3.989">they work different and they&amp;#39;re useful</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="5.52">for different conditions and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="236.109" dur="8.1">to explain in the next two weeks how</text>
  <text start="239.5" dur="8.639">power and authority differ so what is</text>
  <text start="244.209" dur="5.911">power essentially power is energy if you</text>
  <text start="248.139" dur="4.38">want to think of it that way the easiest</text>
  <text start="250.12" dur="5.6">way to think of power for healing is</text>
  <text start="252.519" dur="6.601">thinking of energy the human body is</text>
  <text start="255.72" dur="6.129">essentially a very complex series of</text>
  <text start="259.12" dur="5.28">electrical systems in your heart the</text>
  <text start="261.849" dur="5.161">reason why your heart beats is there is</text>
  <text start="264.4" dur="3.87">an electrical conduction system pathway</text>
  <text start="267.01" dur="3.48">pathway of nerves that go through your</text>
  <text start="268.27" dur="5.55">heart they carry an electrical current</text>
  <text start="270.49" dur="6.78">that paces your heart and makes the</text>
  <text start="273.82" dur="6.21">muscle contract at a certain rate it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.27" dur="5.04">all electricity electricity is a form of</text>
  <text start="280.03" dur="5.58">power so</text>
  <text start="282.31" dur="7.04">in the mitochondria of the cells the</text>
  <text start="285.61" dur="6.3">mitochondria is the powerhouse of cells</text>
  <text start="289.35" dur="6.49">mitochondria produce adenosine</text>
  <text start="291.91" dur="8.45">triphosphate ATP and ATP is what the</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="8.88">body uses for energy if you put a</text>
  <text start="300.36" dur="8.47">diagnostic device on living cells you</text>
  <text start="304.72" dur="6.63">will see that they all operate at a</text>
  <text start="308.83" dur="4.11">certain electrical frequency there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="311.35" dur="3.93">electromagnetic frequency that&amp;#39;s given</text>
  <text start="312.94" dur="4.65">off by all living tissue that</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="6.35">electromagnetic frequency can be</text>
  <text start="317.59" dur="6.12">measured and healthy tissue has a higher</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="4.54">electromagnetic frequency than diseased</text>
  <text start="323.71" dur="4.71">tissue for example the average human</text>
  <text start="326.17" dur="4.92">body if you just kind of measure the</text>
  <text start="328.42" dur="6.36">frequency of a human body usually around</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="7.05">68 Hertz tumors and cancer typically</text>
  <text start="334.78" dur="5.28">measure out at around 50 Hertz diseased</text>
  <text start="338.14" dur="6.98">tissue operates at a lower frequency</text>
  <text start="340.06" dur="9.87">than healthy tissue so the human body is</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="7.12">a complex series of cells and tissues</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="4.11">and nerves and muscles that are all</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="6">carry electrical current through them</text>
  <text start="354.04" dur="7.38">okay electricity is power now many times</text>
  <text start="358.24" dur="5.1">when a person has a disease process they</text>
  <text start="361.42" dur="7.23">are suffering a lack of power a lack of</text>
  <text start="363.34" dur="8.82">energy and a release of power will cure</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="5.73">the disease process let me ask you this</text>
  <text start="372.16" dur="5.19">you have a car and you have a battery</text>
  <text start="374.38" dur="5.1">that you used to start the car if the</text>
  <text start="377.35" dur="4.23">battery for the car was in the trunk and</text>
  <text start="379.48" dur="4.14">it wasn&amp;#39;t connected to the battery</text>
  <text start="381.58" dur="7.95">cables you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to start it</text>
  <text start="383.62" dur="8.34">why because the source of power has to</text>
  <text start="389.53" dur="4.26">be connected to the battery cables and</text>
  <text start="391.96" dur="5.75">the ignition system and the electronics</text>
  <text start="393.79" dur="6.18">to make the car run power has to be</text>
  <text start="397.71" dur="5.74">connected to something and it flows</text>
  <text start="399.97" dur="6.18">through contact it flows through nervous</text>
  <text start="403.45" dur="5.73">system tissue flows through nerves cells</text>
  <text start="406.15" dur="5.07">axons dendrites nerve cells it flows</text>
  <text start="409.18" dur="3.99">through the body in the same way that</text>
  <text start="411.22" dur="3.86">electricity flows from a battery into</text>
  <text start="413.17" dur="5.66">your car&amp;#39;s ignition</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="6.63">in lighting system so in order for your</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="4.41">body to work correctly the wiring all</text>
  <text start="421.71" dur="4.709">the electronics have to be working</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="5.639">correctly that is a kind of a</text>
  <text start="426.419" dur="5.34">description of power now one of the</text>
  <text start="428.879" dur="6.211">reasons why people misunderstand what</text>
  <text start="431.759" dur="6.241">power is is that many translations of</text>
  <text start="435.09" dur="5.879">the Bible actually miss translate the</text>
  <text start="438" dur="3.96">word power in the scriptures all right</text>
  <text start="440.969" dur="5.22">I&amp;#39;m gonna give you an example</text>
  <text start="441.96" dur="6.359">so in Luke 10:19 let me give you a</text>
  <text start="446.189" dur="5.401">little bit of history on this and Luke</text>
  <text start="448.319" dur="5.94">10 is where Jesus Commission&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="451.59" dur="6.09">seventy to go out and heal the sick in</text>
  <text start="454.259" dur="5.34">Matthew chapter 10 and Luke nine he</text>
  <text start="457.68" dur="3.84">Commission&amp;#39;s the twelve we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="459.599" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a minute but in</text>
  <text start="461.52" dur="4.44">Luke chapter ten after the twelve come</text>
  <text start="464.039" dur="3.84">back the disciples come back Jesus</text>
  <text start="465.96" dur="3.509">Commission&amp;#39;s is seventy and sends them</text>
  <text start="467.879" dur="4.891">out and this is Luke chapter 10 verse</text>
  <text start="469.469" dur="6.391">nineteen King James Version behold I</text>
  <text start="472.77" dur="5.22">give unto you power to tread on serpents</text>
  <text start="475.86" dur="4.049">and scorpions and over all the power of</text>
  <text start="477.99" dur="5.37">the enemy and nothing shall by any means</text>
  <text start="479.909" dur="7.47">harm you now in the King James this</text>
  <text start="483.36" dur="6.209">verse uses the word power twice I give</text>
  <text start="487.379" dur="5.1">you power to tread on serpents and</text>
  <text start="489.569" dur="5.19">scorpions and over all the power of the</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="4.951">enemy okay if you go to the Greek</text>
  <text start="494.759" dur="6.181">concordance and look this verse up it</text>
  <text start="497.43" dur="7.109">actually the first word this translated</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="6.21">power is not the normal word for power</text>
  <text start="504.539" dur="4.321">it&amp;#39;s the word for authority there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="507.15" dur="4.59">different Greek words that we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="5.789">about here power the Greek word is</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="4.049">Dunamis it&amp;#39;s the root of the word</text>
  <text start="514.649" dur="5.13">dynamite</text>
  <text start="515.789" dur="5.461">it literally means energy what happens</text>
  <text start="519.779" dur="2.401">when you blow up a stick of dynamite it</text>
  <text start="521.25" dur="4.709">releases energy</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="7.38">so Dunamis is the New Testament word for</text>
  <text start="525.959" dur="7.081">power ik suzy a&amp;#39; is a new testament word</text>
  <text start="529.56" dur="5.85">for authority excision is the typical</text>
  <text start="533.04" dur="6.57">kind of authority it&amp;#39;s the authority</text>
  <text start="535.41" dur="7.41">that people are given to operate in</text>
  <text start="539.61" dur="5.669">realms of government it is authority</text>
  <text start="542.82" dur="4.829">that is granted by one person to another</text>
  <text start="545.279" dur="3.241">person to operate on their behalf that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="547.649" dur="4.141">authority</text>
  <text start="548.52" dur="6.69">soozee Oh whenever Jesus got rid of an</text>
  <text start="551.79" dur="6.06">evil spirit he exercised authority to</text>
  <text start="555.21" dur="6.09">remove the evil spirit when he released</text>
  <text start="557.85" dur="6.39">power he released energy so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="561.3" dur="4.47">completely different dynamic now like I</text>
  <text start="564.24" dur="7.98">said in this message we&amp;#39;re gonna focus</text>
  <text start="565.77" dur="9.03">on power so and Luke 9 it says Jesus</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="5.64">called his twelve disciples together and</text>
  <text start="574.8" dur="7.65">gave them power and authority over</text>
  <text start="577.86" dur="9.3">devils and to cure diseases take note of</text>
  <text start="582.45" dur="7.5">this verse this is Luke 9 verse 1 call</text>
  <text start="587.16" dur="5.73">his disciples together the twelve he</text>
  <text start="589.95" dur="6.66">gave them power and authority to cast</text>
  <text start="592.89" dur="6.78">out devils and to cure diseases so he</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="6.54">gives them two tools to do two different</text>
  <text start="599.67" dur="5.4">things he gives them power to cure</text>
  <text start="603.15" dur="6.69">diseases he gives them authority to cast</text>
  <text start="605.07" dur="9.9">out devils that is the difference power</text>
  <text start="609.84" dur="7.35">is used to work miracles Authority is</text>
  <text start="614.97" dur="3.78">used to do healing and deliverance and</text>
  <text start="617.19" dur="5.97">miracles and healing are two different</text>
  <text start="618.75" dur="7.46">things typically in the church it is</text>
  <text start="623.16" dur="7.65">taught that the difference between a</text>
  <text start="626.21" dur="8.44">miracle and healing is time most people</text>
  <text start="630.81" dur="5.94">who operate in healing have taught that</text>
  <text start="634.65" dur="4.53">the difference between a miracle and a</text>
  <text start="636.75" dur="5.16">healing is time if something happens</text>
  <text start="639.18" dur="5.28">instantly it is a miracle and if</text>
  <text start="641.91" dur="5.07">something happens over time it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="644.46" dur="5.61">healing well you&amp;#39;re free to think that</text>
  <text start="646.98" dur="6">if you want but that is not what I see</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="7.32">when I read the New Testament I see two</text>
  <text start="652.98" dur="8.19">different operations for healing and</text>
  <text start="657.39" dur="5.31">miracles the healing is the removal of</text>
  <text start="661.17" dur="4.71">something that&amp;#39;s not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="662.7" dur="5.1">there a miracle is the creation of</text>
  <text start="665.88" dur="6.36">something that isn&amp;#39;t there but is</text>
  <text start="667.8" dur="7.47">supposed to be miracles are creative if</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="4.29">a person doesn&amp;#39;t have an eye or if they</text>
  <text start="675.27" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t have an eardrum or if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="676.53" dur="5.55">missing a kidney and you want to create</text>
  <text start="679.47" dur="4.679">one you release power</text>
  <text start="682.08" dur="6.379">which creates something that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="684.149" dur="7.681">exist that&amp;#39;s power and that is a miracle</text>
  <text start="688.459" dur="6.581">when God created the earth to use power</text>
  <text start="691.83" dur="6.77">to create something that didn&amp;#39;t exist in</text>
  <text start="695.04" dur="6.33">the spiritual world in a spiritual realm</text>
  <text start="698.6" dur="5.919">you have the ability to create things</text>
  <text start="701.37" dur="5.219">that don&amp;#39;t exist people who operate in</text>
  <text start="704.519" dur="5.671">inner healing emotional healing ministry</text>
  <text start="706.589" dur="5.551">and deliverance they know very well that</text>
  <text start="710.19" dur="4.32">when when they are operating in the</text>

  <text start="879.65" dur="4.41">this and he does it okay we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="881.81" dur="3.96">about authority here and the centurion</text>
  <text start="884.06" dur="3.18">understood how authority worked he said</text>
  <text start="885.77" dur="3.69">you don&amp;#39;t have to come to my house just</text>
  <text start="887.24" dur="3.78">say a word Jesus heard it and he</text>
  <text start="889.46" dur="3.48">marveled and he said to those who</text>
  <text start="891.02" dur="4.77">followed I say to you I have not found</text>
  <text start="892.94" dur="4.98">such great faith in all of Israel then</text>
  <text start="895.79" dur="5.76">jesus said to the Centurion go your way</text>
  <text start="897.92" dur="5.55">as you have believed so let it be done</text>
  <text start="901.55" dur="5.1">for you and his servant was healed at</text>
  <text start="903.47" dur="7.2">that same hour okay so Jesus in the</text>
  <text start="906.65" dur="7.83">first case he touched the leper released</text>
  <text start="910.67" dur="7.11">power and his skin was healed in the</text>
  <text start="914.48" dur="6.02">second case he spoke a word over a great</text>

  <text start="927.71" dur="4.53">or releasing a word so in here you see</text>
  <text start="931.22" dur="3.36">the difference between power and</text>
  <text start="932.24" dur="7.53">authority so where does the power come</text>
  <text start="934.58" dur="8.25">from to heal well in Luke chapter 9 it</text>

  <text start="1412.15" dur="7.26">for a few years now it does take</text>
  <text start="1414.28" dur="8.82">practice but releasing power is really</text>

  <text start="1423.1" dur="6.329">in God&amp;#39;s ability and willingness to heal</text>

  <text start="1435.22" dur="3.57">all about you know in the Bible when it</text>
  <text start="1436.63" dur="3.48">says people are healed by the laying on</text>

  <text start="1440.11" dur="4.14">about they&amp;#39;re laying out of hands is</text>

  <text start="1445.9" dur="5.85">that&amp;#39;s what it is I wanted to discuss</text>
  <text start="1449.23" dur="8.819">one last thing if that&amp;#39;s okay and that</text>
  <text start="1451.75" dur="9.679">is angels because power is most</text>
  <text start="1458.049" dur="6.241">effectively released through contact or</text>
  <text start="1461.429" dur="4.091">proximity now here&amp;#39;s the thing it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1464.29" dur="3.42">my experience that you don&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="1465.52" dur="5.49">have to be in direct contact with the</text>
  <text start="1467.71" dur="4.68">person who needs a miracle if you</text>
  <text start="1471.01" dur="4.89">release power but you have to be</text>
  <text start="1472.39" dur="6.3">somewhat close to them the power for</text>
  <text start="1475.9" dur="5.85">releasing miracles will flow a certain</text>
  <text start="1478.69" dur="4.29">distance but it seems to be limited I</text>
  <text start="1481.75" dur="5.79">don&amp;#39;t know what the limit</text>
  <text start="1482.98" dur="8.91">kids are but authority does not have any</text>
  <text start="1487.54" dur="7.83">distance so when jesus healed the</text>
  <text start="1491.89" dur="5.25">Centurions servant he spoke a word and</text>
  <text start="1495.37" dur="2.82">regardless of where that servant was he</text>
  <text start="1497.14" dur="5.039">could be on the other side of the world</text>
  <text start="1498.19" dur="6.3">that authority healed his servant</text>
  <text start="1502.179" dur="4.651">regardless of where he was and I have</text>
  <text start="1504.49" dur="4.71">found that authority is not proximal it</text>
  <text start="1506.83" dur="4.77">doesn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not an issue of being in</text>
  <text start="1509.2" dur="4.26">contact with someone I can exercise</text>
  <text start="1511.6" dur="4.11">authority around the world that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1513.46" dur="5.339">really matter where the person is the</text>
  <text start="1515.71" dur="4.98">exercise of authority is an issue of the</text>

  <text start="1526.33" dur="5.39">have to be with the person who needs</text>
  <text start="1528.78" dur="6.49">healing when I exercise authority</text>
  <text start="1531.72" dur="8.67">however releasing power is a different</text>
  <text start="1535.27" dur="7.8">issue because my experience is that</text>
  <text start="1540.39" dur="6.4">releasing power actually is an issue of</text>
  <text start="1543.07" dur="8.7">proximity and closeness and how I have</text>
  <text start="1546.79" dur="7.11">gotten around that is angels I know that</text>
  <text start="1551.77" dur="4.59">there are angels around me who know how</text>

  <text start="1566.95" dur="6.66">other people do so in I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="1570.94" dur="6.27">read for you a short passage from the</text>
  <text start="1573.61" dur="5.88">Gospel of John this is John 5 verses 1</text>
  <text start="1577.21" dur="4.29">through 9 after this there was a feast</text>
  <text start="1579.49" dur="5.01">of the Jews and Jesus went up to</text>
  <text start="1581.5" dur="5.22">Jerusalem now in Jerusalem by the Sheep</text>
  <text start="1584.5" dur="5.19">gate there was a pool which is called in</text>
  <text start="1586.72" dur="6">Hebrew Bethesda having five porches and</text>
  <text start="1589.69" dur="6.09">in these pools lay a great multitude of</text>
  <text start="1592.72" dur="5.339">sick people blind lamed paralyzed</text>
  <text start="1595.78" dur="5.7">waiting for the moving of the water for</text>
  <text start="1598.059" dur="5.851">an angel went down from time to time and</text>
  <text start="1601.48" dur="4.23">stirred the water now whoever stepped in</text>
  <text start="1603.91" dur="3.75">first after the stirring of the water</text>
  <text start="1605.71" dur="4.41">was made well of whatever disease they</text>
  <text start="1607.66" dur="4.86">had now a certain man was there who had</text>
  <text start="1610.12" dur="3.809">an infirmity for thirty-eight years okay</text>
  <text start="1612.52" dur="2.779">so we know how the rest of this passage</text>
  <text start="1613.929" dur="3.98">goes geez</text>
  <text start="1615.299" dur="4.23">said do you want to be made well he said</text>
  <text start="1617.909" dur="3.061">he&amp;#39;s kind of made an excuse no one ever</text>
  <text start="1619.529" dur="5.191">puts me in the water if somebody gets in</text>
  <text start="1620.97" dur="6.99">first and then jesus healed him but the</text>
  <text start="1624.72" dur="5.459">point of this particular verse is there</text>
  <text start="1627.96" dur="4.289">is an angel who came down and stirred</text>
  <text start="1630.179" dur="3.96">the water and when the angel stirred the</text>
  <text start="1632.249" dur="5.941">water whoever got in first was healed</text>
  <text start="1634.139" dur="5.701">well how does that work well I am NOT</text>
  <text start="1638.19" dur="4.319">gonna be dogmatic about this but it</text>
  <text start="1639.84" dur="5.189">seems to me as if the angel released</text>
  <text start="1642.509" dur="5.88">healing power into the water and whoever</text>
  <text start="1645.029" dur="5.58">came in contact with the water that had</text>

  <text start="1729.989" dur="5.611">command things to be healed and did this</text>
  <text start="1733.44" dur="3.599">for like ten minutes and then I kind of</text>

  <text start="1828.3" dur="5.76">after I went home I was laying in bed</text>
  <text start="1831.09" dur="5.7">getting ready to go to sleep and I saw</text>
  <text start="1834.06" dur="5.13">an angel standing next to me at my bed</text>
  <text start="1836.79" dur="6.12">and he had this big container and he</text>
  <text start="1839.19" dur="6.27">dumped this oil on me and she says I had</text>
  <text start="1842.91" dur="5.46">been feeling great this entire time and</text>
  <text start="1845.46" dur="5.49">now it has been a couple of months since</text>
