  <text start="39.82" dur="7.05">things recording some videos getting</text>

  <text start="46.87" dur="5.369">ready for our conference but I have been</text>
  <text start="50.44" dur="4.83">following the news I&amp;#39;ve been up on</text>
  <text start="52.239" dur="6.531">what&amp;#39;s going on and I have three things</text>
  <text start="55.27" dur="7.86">I&amp;#39;d like to talk about today</text>
  <text start="58.77" dur="8.98">they are health care or what I&amp;#39;m calling</text>
  <text start="63.13" dur="9.75">health scares President Trump and his</text>
  <text start="67.75" dur="7.89">undignified tweets and an interesting</text>
  <text start="72.88" dur="8.19">tweet from Eric Holder that came out</text>
  <text start="75.64" dur="7.05">about 12:30 this morning so those are</text>
  <text start="81.07" dur="5.93">the issues I want to talk about this</text>
  <text start="82.69" dur="6.78">morning so there is this continuing</text>
  <text start="87" dur="5.32">drama going on with the Senate and the</text>
  <text start="89.47" dur="6.649">health care bill and I can&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="92.32" dur="6.15">votes and what are they going to do and</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="3.521">Democrats are kind of you know saying</text>
  <text start="98.47" dur="3.36">well we need single-payer health care</text>
  <text start="99.64" dur="5.04">and a lot of debates and discussion</text>
  <text start="101.83" dur="7.109">going on Rand Paul had a very</text>
  <text start="104.68" dur="7.59">interesting proposition seeing that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="108.939" dur="7.171">hard to get the majority and all of the</text>
  <text start="112.27" dur="6.54">Republicans to vote on one bill for</text>
  <text start="116.11" dur="5.25">health care he came up with the</text>
  <text start="118.81" dur="3.96">brilliant idea the other day and and</text>
  <text start="121.36" dur="5.1">he&amp;#39;s actually had this idea for a while</text>
  <text start="122.77" dur="5.19">his Rand Paul being a libertarian once</text>
  <text start="126.46" dur="3.059">the government out of health care as</text>
  <text start="127.96" dur="3.54">much as possible he just doesn&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="129.519" dur="3.481">that government should be in health care</text>
  <text start="131.5" dur="3.72">at all it&amp;#39;s not in the Constitution</text>
  <text start="133" dur="3.959">there&amp;#39;s nothing in the Constitution that</text>
  <text start="135.22" dur="7.9">says government should be providing</text>
  <text start="136.959" dur="8.741">health care a single payer has a option</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="5.64">or for health insurance health not</text>
  <text start="145.7" dur="5.52">health care itself insurance anyone in</text>
  <text start="148.76" dur="4.949">this country can go to an hospital and</text>
  <text start="151.22" dur="3.39">get treated for our condition okay you</text>
  <text start="153.709" dur="2.731">don&amp;#39;t need insurance</text>
  <text start="154.61" dur="3.87">you don&amp;#39;t need coverage you can get</text>
  <text start="156.44" dur="6.42">health care without having health</text>
  <text start="158.48" dur="6">insurance the the hype and hysteria that</text>
  <text start="162.86" dur="4.23">people are going to die because they</text>
  <text start="164.48" dur="5.61">don&amp;#39;t have health care it&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="167.09" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s hype and hysteria I have been doing</text>
  <text start="170.09" dur="5.22">EMS for 35 years Transporter zillion</text>
  <text start="174.2" dur="3.72">people to the hospital</text>
  <text start="175.31" dur="5.1">and out of the hospital into nursing</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="5.909">homes and rehabs in different places and</text>
  <text start="180.41" dur="6.18">a lot of them didn&amp;#39;t have insurance they</text>
  <text start="183.829" dur="5.22">still get health care this is not an</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="5.28">issue of health care it&amp;#39;s an issue of</text>
  <text start="189.049" dur="5.66">health insurance it&amp;#39;s who&amp;#39;s going to pay</text>
  <text start="191.87" dur="6.36">for it if that&amp;#39;s the real question so</text>
  <text start="194.709" dur="5.351">when I have unfortunately those Canadian</text>
  <text start="198.23" dur="3.21">friends who think oh there are people</text>
  <text start="200.06" dur="3.86">dying in America because they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="201.44" dur="4.829">access to health care that is not true</text>
  <text start="203.92" dur="5.17">anyone in America has access to health</text>
  <text start="206.269" dur="4.951">care now you may not be able to go to a</text>
  <text start="209.09" dur="3.75">specific primary care physician or a</text>
  <text start="211.22" dur="3.18">doctor or whatever because you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="2.79">have the right insurance it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="214.4" dur="2.97">different issue that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you</text>
  <text start="215.63" dur="3.419">don&amp;#39;t have access to health care it</text>
  <text start="217.37" dur="4.739">means you&amp;#39;re limited in your ability to</text>
  <text start="219.049" dur="6.78">have a primary care provider but if you</text>
  <text start="222.109" dur="6.541">need if you have a ruptured appendix if</text>
  <text start="225.829" dur="5.19">you have a stroke if you have a sudden</text>
  <text start="228.65" dur="4.29">problem with asthma you can go to the</text>
  <text start="231.019" dur="3.03">hospital to get treated and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="232.94" dur="2.79">going to treat you in the emergency</text>
  <text start="234.049" dur="3.66">department if you need to go to the ICU</text>
  <text start="235.73" dur="3.24">they&amp;#39;ll send you there you&amp;#39;ll be taken</text>
  <text start="237.709" dur="2.64">care of they&amp;#39;re not going to let you die</text>
  <text start="238.97" dur="4.799">because you don&amp;#39;t have insurance now you</text>
  <text start="240.349" dur="8.491">will get a bill but it&amp;#39;s been my</text>
  <text start="243.769" dur="6.12">experience and my family we have we have</text>
  <text start="248.84" dur="3.45">people in our family who did not have</text>
  <text start="249.889" dur="5.25">insurance and they ran up some huge</text>
  <text start="252.29" dur="4.289">hospital bills and all they did was</text>
  <text start="255.139" dur="3.09">write to the hospital and say I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="256.579" dur="3.84">indigent I don&amp;#39;t have insurance I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="258.229" dur="3.57">have any money and the hospital has done</text>
  <text start="260.419" dur="3.801">one of two things they have either</text>
  <text start="261.799" dur="4.291">completely wrote off the entire</text>
  <text start="264.22" dur="4.15">hospitalization bill and just wrote it</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="3.81">off as a loss because the hospital can</text>
  <text start="268.37" dur="3.049">take a tax break on anything they write</text>
  <text start="269.9" dur="4.47">off</text>
  <text start="271.419" dur="5.59">when Denise went in and she had a kidney</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="5.249">infection her emergency department</text>
  <text start="277.009" dur="5.641">was three or four thousand dollars for</text>
  <text start="279.619" dur="4.741">being in the ER for like two hours they</text>
  <text start="282.65" dur="3.539">put us on a payment plan and they said</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="4.35">how much do you want to pay a month and</text>
  <text start="286.189" dur="4.111">she said what&amp;#39;d he mean and the hospital</text>
  <text start="288.71" dur="3.509">said just tell us however much you want</text>
  <text start="290.3" dur="4.44">to pay and she said so if I want to pay</text>
  <text start="292.219" dur="4.081">$10 a month you&amp;#39;ll take $10 a month and</text>
  <text start="294.74" dur="2.729">they said yeah we just need to know that</text>
  <text start="296.3" dur="3.359">you&amp;#39;re going to be making payments just</text>
  <text start="297.469" dur="5.521">pay it off as slower as fast as you want</text>
  <text start="299.659" dur="4.71">so so it&amp;#39;s not like you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="302.99" dur="5.489">access to health care if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="304.369" dur="7.711">insurance so that the Senate will come</text>
  <text start="308.479" dur="5.58">up with a bill it&amp;#39;s not a question of</text>
  <text start="312.08" dur="4.44">are they going to have a health care</text>
  <text start="314.059" dur="4.29">model they are it&amp;#39;s only a question of</text>
  <text start="316.52" dur="4.289">what is it going to look like and when</text>
  <text start="318.349" dur="3.93">will they have it voted on and then did</text>
  <text start="320.809" dur="3.66">they go to the house and do a</text>
  <text start="322.279" dur="3.331">reconciliation iron out the differences</text>
  <text start="324.469" dur="2.88">between the House and the Senate</text>
  <text start="325.61" dur="4.829">versions and then they&amp;#39;ll have a bill</text>
  <text start="327.349" dur="4.32">now what Rand Paul came up with and he</text>
  <text start="330.439" dur="2.82">proposed this to the president the</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="4.351">president was like that&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="333.259" dur="8.011">pretty good idea split it into two bills</text>
  <text start="336.02" dur="8.16">okay and what Rand Paul is suggesting is</text>
  <text start="341.27" dur="5.489">that we because there are because</text>
  <text start="344.18" dur="5.25">Republicans tend to be more on the side</text>
  <text start="346.759" dur="4.111">of let&amp;#39;s repeal Obamacare and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="349.43" dur="4.68">having more problems with what are we</text>
  <text start="350.87" dur="5.339">going to pay for and fund Democrats are</text>
  <text start="354.11" dur="4.44">more on the issue of hey let&amp;#39;s pay for</text>
  <text start="356.209" dur="4.02">and fund everything let&amp;#39;s just throw</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="4.409">money at this problem and hopefully that</text>
  <text start="360.229" dur="5.641">will fix it so what Rand Paul is saying</text>
  <text start="362.959" dur="6.36">is let&amp;#39;s get the Republicans to vote on</text>
  <text start="365.87" dur="6.569">repealing the regulations and the taxes</text>
  <text start="369.319" dur="6.57">that are in Obamacare and and then do a</text>
  <text start="372.439" dur="4.95">separate bill that would fund the health</text>
  <text start="375.889" dur="3.96">care system that needs to be in place</text>
  <text start="377.389" dur="5.58">and we&amp;#39;d be more likely to get Democrats</text>
  <text start="379.849" dur="6.231">to vote in on that I think I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.969" dur="5.91">a it&amp;#39;s a really interesting idea I think</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="4.839">the president is interested in it he is</text>
  <text start="388.879" dur="3.33">that if this current measure that</text>
  <text start="390.919" dur="3.381">they&amp;#39;re working on falls apart and I</text>
  <text start="392.209" dur="4.411">can&amp;#39;t get the votes maybe they go to</text>
  <text start="394.3" dur="5.769">situation where they split it into two</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="7.109">bills I don&amp;#39;t know there will be a</text>
  <text start="400.069" dur="5.46">resolution on this health care bill it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.729" dur="5.16">nothing to be afraid of</text>
  <text start="405.529" dur="5.181">when when you hear the terms full repeal</text>
  <text start="408.889" dur="4.221">of Obamacare and is now</text>
  <text start="410.71" dur="6.27">going to happen that is what Rand Paul</text>
  <text start="413.11" dur="6.09">wants Rand Paul wants a full tongue</text>
  <text start="416.98" dur="7.71">repeal of Obamacare that is not going to</text>
  <text start="419.2" dur="7.38">happen not going to happen the first</text>
  <text start="424.69" dur="5.04">measure that the Senate came out with</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="7.83">had a whole bunch of provisions that</text>
  <text start="429.73" dur="6">would repeal taxes that Obamacare put in</text>
  <text start="434.41" dur="3.09">place on different people for different</text>
  <text start="435.73" dur="4.17">things that&amp;#39;s how they paid for this</text>
  <text start="437.5" dur="5.67">very expensive program with all these</text>
  <text start="439.9" dur="5.46">taxes so what is going to happen</text>
  <text start="443.17" dur="5.94">probably if they go down either way</text>
  <text start="445.36" dur="5.52">whatever however this ends up the Senate</text>
  <text start="449.11" dur="4.08">and the house will vote on a bill that</text>
  <text start="450.88" dur="4.74">will repeal and get rid of a lot of</text>
  <text start="453.19" dur="4.2">these taxes for different things</text>
  <text start="455.62" dur="5.67">there&amp;#39;s taxes on prescriptions there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="457.39" dur="5.13">taxes on everything and the regulations</text>
  <text start="461.29" dur="3.06">the regulations are another the other</text>
  <text start="462.52" dur="3.39">part of it that needs to be repealed</text>
  <text start="464.35" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s just there&amp;#39;s too much regulatory</text>
  <text start="465.91" dur="8.31">red tape in all of this so regardless of</text>
  <text start="469.99" dur="6.18">whether they do a 2-part repeal and then</text>
  <text start="474.22" dur="3.42">fund or whether they do it all in one</text>
  <text start="476.17" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re going to have to break</text>
  <text start="477.64" dur="3.78">provisions and that will remove the</text>
  <text start="479.62" dur="5.37">taxes remove the regulation and then</text>
  <text start="481.42" dur="5.28">fund some other things now don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="484.99" dur="4.29">concerned it&amp;#39;s not going to be a full</text>
  <text start="486.7" dur="6.36">repeal and and when the new legislation</text>
  <text start="489.28" dur="6.9">goes into place first it has to be it</text>
  <text start="493.06" dur="5.34">has to go through the Senate House voted</text>
  <text start="496.18" dur="3.66">on signed by the president that it has</text>
  <text start="498.4" dur="3.96">to take place it&amp;#39;s not going to take</text>
  <text start="499.84" dur="4.14">place immediately Obamacare if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="502.36" dur="3.69">Obamacare is not going to go away</text>
  <text start="503.98" dur="3">immediately there&amp;#39;s a provision where</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="2.85">it&amp;#39;s going to take a certain amount of</text>
  <text start="506.98" dur="3.51">time for the new system to come into</text>
  <text start="508.9" dur="4.14">place and for people on the old system</text>
  <text start="510.49" dur="4.56">to find something else so it&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="513.04" dur="5.28">to be hopefully if they get this thing</text>
  <text start="515.05" dur="6.66">done soon they&amp;#39;ll get it done before all</text>
  <text start="518.32" dur="5.04">of the insurance carriers in different</text>
  <text start="521.71" dur="3.39">states pull out of the Obamacare</text>
  <text start="523.36" dur="3.93">exchanges and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening I</text>
  <text start="525.1" dur="3.42">mean that&amp;#39;s the scary thing is there are</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="2.82">a lot of states not only have one</text>
  <text start="528.52" dur="3.06">carrier and there&amp;#39;s some a lot of</text>
  <text start="530.11" dur="2.67">counties that have no carriers they</text>
  <text start="531.58" dur="2.76">carry out Obamacare and it&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="532.78" dur="4.26">option you don&amp;#39;t have any insurance</text>
  <text start="534.34" dur="5.13">carriers so they hopefully look at this</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="4.98">done soon I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything</text>
  <text start="539.47" dur="4.26">to be afraid of there the president is</text>
  <text start="542.02" dur="5.34">not going to sign a bill</text>
  <text start="543.73" dur="5.28">that is going to screw people over if it</text>
  <text start="547.36" dur="4.14">does not take care of pre-existing</text>
  <text start="549.01" dur="4.68">conditions and if it does not take care</text>
  <text start="551.5" dur="4.079">of people who need good coverage I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="553.69" dur="4.649">think the president will sign it he just</text>
  <text start="555.579" dur="6.301">won&amp;#39;t and I think the Senate and House</text>
  <text start="558.339" dur="5.911">know that and I am happy that the</text>
  <text start="561.88" dur="4.709">president got really involved in the</text>
  <text start="564.25" dur="4.079">House bill and he&amp;#39;s really involved in</text>
  <text start="566.589" dur="3.93">the Senate bill when the Senate takes a</text>
  <text start="568.329" dur="4.471">vote nope can&amp;#39;t get the votes or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.519" dur="3.231">ready getting ready to do a vote and</text>
  <text start="572.8" dur="3.51">they don&amp;#39;t have the votes</text>
  <text start="573.75" dur="4.12">Trump sends buses over to the Senate</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="3.24">puts them on the bus come over to the</text>
  <text start="577.87" dur="4.7">White House let&amp;#39;s talk let&amp;#39;s iron out</text>
  <text start="579.55" dur="5.75">some differences if we can come to a</text>
  <text start="582.57" dur="5.68">consensus and what we&amp;#39;re doing here so I</text>
  <text start="585.3" dur="4.33">am happy to see that the president is</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="3.75">intimately involved in the process</text>
  <text start="589.63" dur="3.84">ultimately it&amp;#39;s up to the House and</text>
  <text start="592" dur="4.1">Senate to decide what this is going to</text>
  <text start="593.47" dur="4.859">look like but the president is very</text>

  <text start="1675.299" dur="7.651">I&amp;#39;m going to simplify this for you if I</text>
  <text start="1678.239" dur="8.64">could and Adam has pointed this out</text>
  <text start="1682.95" dur="7.26">repeatedly Comey is the guy who has</text>
  <text start="1686.879" dur="6.75">access to everyone Comey as head of FBI</text>
  <text start="1690.21" dur="6.839">has access to who was unmasked how it</text>
  <text start="1693.629" dur="6.6">was done who it was leaked to he has</text>
  <text start="1697.049" dur="5.01">access he knows who in the National</text>
  <text start="1700.229" dur="6.03">Security Council was doing what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1702.059" dur="7.2">asking he knows all he has intelligence</text>
  <text start="1706.259" dur="6.02">firm ation on everybody he knows who is</text>
  <text start="1709.259" dur="8.64">in the DOJ who was leaking information</text>
  <text start="1712.279" dur="10.38">probably he knows anyone in the NSA who</text>
  <text start="1717.899" dur="13.13">has been having some sketchy behavior</text>
  <text start="1722.659" dur="11.411">Comey knows everything and Comey is</text>
  <text start="1731.029" dur="5.83">probably able to be charged with some</text>
  <text start="1734.07" dur="5.73">criminal with some felonies leaking and</text>
  <text start="1736.859" dur="5.491">some other things if Comey is</text>
  <text start="1739.8" dur="12">in danger of being charged and sent to</text>
  <text start="1742.35" dur="12.36">prison what if I work if I were Jeff</text>
  <text start="1751.8" dur="4.71">Sessions I would put pressure on Comey</text>
  <text start="1754.71" dur="4.08">and say look you know how this works</text>
  <text start="1756.51" dur="5.54">you&amp;#39;re the director of the FBI you tell</text>
  <text start="1758.79" dur="5.55">us what you know we&amp;#39;ll give you immunity</text>
  <text start="1762.05" dur="3.79">you don&amp;#39;t tell us what you know and</text>
  <text start="1764.34" dur="3.15">we&amp;#39;re going to prosecute you to the</text>
  <text start="1765.84" dur="3.33">fullest extent of the law and you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1767.49" dur="7.07">in jail until you&amp;#39;re probably 75 years</text>
  <text start="1769.17" dur="6.63">old so there&amp;#39;s this question now if</text>
  <text start="1774.56" dur="4.93">Comey</text>
  <text start="1775.8" dur="6.6">flips and if Comey asks for an immunity</text>
  <text start="1779.49" dur="5.52">deal he then has to in order for him to</text>
  <text start="1782.4" dur="5.43">get immunity he has to agree to</text>
  <text start="1785.01" dur="5.46">cooperate with all investigations he has</text>
  <text start="1787.83" dur="4.35">to agree to tell the truth in every</text>
  <text start="1790.47" dur="3.99">question that he&amp;#39;s asked he has to be</text>
  <text start="1792.18" dur="5.04">honest and truthful as soon as he lies</text>
  <text start="1794.46" dur="5.67">or refuses to answer a question his</text>
  <text start="1797.22" dur="6.71">immunity is gone when they give you</text>
  <text start="1800.13" dur="6.72">immunity it is based on cooperation and</text>
  <text start="1803.93" dur="4.57">honesty if you do not cooperate and if</text>
  <text start="1806.85" dur="6.54">you are not honest through immunity is</text>
  <text start="1808.5" dur="7.77">gone and you can be charged and all the</text>
  <text start="1813.39" dur="4.11">people who were investigated and they</text>
  <text start="1816.27" dur="3.32">weren&amp;#39;t even really investigated during</text>
  <text start="1817.5" dur="4.26">the Hillary Clinton email at</text>
  <text start="1819.59" dur="5.86">investigation if you want to call it</text>
  <text start="1821.76" dur="7.53">that so the FBI gave immunity to a lot</text>
  <text start="1825.45" dur="4.89">of people and told them you&amp;#39;re not in</text>
  <text start="1829.29" dur="2.55">danger you didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong</text>
  <text start="1830.34" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re not going to charge you we just</text>
  <text start="1831.84" dur="4.64">need to get some statements right so the</text>
  <text start="1833.85" dur="7.2">people who got immunity from the FBI</text>
  <text start="1836.48" dur="7.87">under Comey for the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="1841.05" dur="5.87">investigation are not under immunity for</text>
  <text start="1844.35" dur="5.93">anything that has to do with unmasking</text>
  <text start="1846.92" dur="7.42">leaking anything of that nature</text>
  <text start="1850.28" dur="5.67">even for any conflict of interest if</text>
  <text start="1854.34" dur="3.96">they had a position in government and</text>
  <text start="1855.95" dur="3.97">they should have recused himself from</text>
  <text start="1858.3" dur="4.26">something and they didn&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1859.92" dur="5.46">they don&amp;#39;t have immunity from that so</text>
  <text start="1862.56" dur="7.29">they&amp;#39;re the people in the Department of</text>
  <text start="1865.38" dur="7.18">Justice and FBI the black hats who are</text>
  <text start="1869.85" dur="7.37">trying to</text>
  <text start="1872.56" dur="7.9">take down the Trump administration they</text>
  <text start="1877.22" dur="6.6">are all at risk of being exposed</text>
  <text start="1880.46" dur="5.61">if Comey flips if Comey does get</text>
  <text start="1883.82" dur="4.8">immunity and he&amp;#39;s not going to get it</text>
  <text start="1886.07" dur="3.75">from Muller okay that&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="1888.62" dur="3.39">happen that&amp;#39;s not how it works</text>
  <text start="1889.82" dur="6.57">the only person is going to give Comey</text>
  <text start="1892.01" dur="7.14">immunity is Jeff Sessions and if they</text>
  <text start="1896.39" dur="5.4">put the screws to Comey and if he flips</text>
  <text start="1899.15" dur="6.96">he has to tell them everything about</text>
  <text start="1901.79" dur="7.86">everybody in the DOJ and FBI and Obama</text>
  <text start="1906.11" dur="5.25">administration and there that is a long</text>
  <text start="1909.65" dur="6.96">list of people who are involved in some</text>
  <text start="1911.36" dur="7.71">very sketchy activity so Lynch is under</text>
  <text start="1916.61" dur="4.29">investigation Comey is under</text>
  <text start="1919.07" dur="3.09">investigation and your McCain is under</text>
  <text start="1920.9" dur="3.57">investigation you have an attorney</text>
