  <text start="278.789" dur="4.831">months but then it came back yeah and</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s been an on-again off-again kind of</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="4.07">a struggle so</text>
  <text start="284.91" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;d I tell people look it&amp;#39;s a battle</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="4.42">you&amp;#39;re gonna win some battles and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="290.04" dur="3.15">gonna lose some and the enemy&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="2.43">push back and you have to keep pushing</text>
  <text start="293.19" dur="3.48">against the enemy and keep gaining</text>
  <text start="294.54" dur="4.5">ground you know as much as we all want</text>
  <text start="296.67" dur="4.17">to have this Lord if you want to heal me</text>
  <text start="299.04" dur="3.69">just heal me of everything I want to be</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="4.2">done with this stuff seldom does it</text>
  <text start="302.73" dur="4.44">actually work that way it&amp;#39;s more of a</text>
  <text start="305.04" dur="4.47">process than anything else and because</text>
  <text start="307.17" dur="3.45">even if you get healed of one thing two</text>
  <text start="309.51" dur="2.94">years later going to have something else</text>
  <text start="310.62" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re going to have to be going after</text>
  <text start="312.45" dur="5.85">that so yeah yeah I mean we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="5.91">going at this now for eight years with</text>
  <text start="318.3" dur="4.38">my health and it&amp;#39;s probably been the the</text>
  <text start="321.18" dur="3.81">second half of those eight years and</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="5.07">then really the most recent like just</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="6.45">this last year or two where we&amp;#39;ve really</text>
  <text start="327.75" dur="6.78">just gone after Jesus for healing in a</text>
  <text start="331.44" dur="4.74">major way even though I&amp;#39;m still dealing</text>
  <text start="334.53" dur="2.82">with him battling it like you just</text>
  <text start="336.18" dur="3.06">mentioned your wife changing her</text>
  <text start="337.35" dur="3.54">thinking you know about some of her</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="3.3">stuff that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve really been</text>
  <text start="340.89" dur="4.44">doing to just changing the way we think</text>
  <text start="342.54" dur="5.79">about it and not identifying ourselves</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="4.41">with it great don&amp;#39;t let it become your</text>
  <text start="348.33" dur="3.12">identity and not let me become our</text>
  <text start="349.74" dur="4.77">identity and because because the truth</text>
  <text start="351.45" dur="4.77">is no matter what our experience is</text>
  <text start="354.51" dur="4.11">showing us right now the truth of the</text>
  <text start="356.22" dur="6.03">Bible is that it doesn&amp;#39;t belong in my</text>
  <text start="358.62" dur="6.33">body because i&amp;#39;m under Jesus right and</text>
  <text start="362.25" dur="5.88">who knows how how long we will be</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="5.16">dealing with this thing but that kind of</text>
  <text start="368.13" dur="4.23">thinking is what I want to keep living</text>
  <text start="370.11" dur="4.98">in you know and the thinking that he is</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="4.98">stronger he is he&amp;#39;s more true than what</text>
  <text start="375.09" dur="5.37">my body might feel on this given day and</text>

  <text start="463.259" dur="5.641">working with a bunch of writers on a</text>
  <text start="465.539" dur="6.361">collaborative project and I thought</text>
  <text start="468.9" dur="5.04">that&amp;#39;s a brilliant idea why not write a</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="4.38">book with a bunch of different authors</text>
  <text start="473.94" dur="5.069">I&amp;#39;m the same subject we can all compare</text>
  <text start="476.28" dur="4.109">our own revelation our own experiences</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="4.491">and share it all and people can learn</text>
  <text start="480.389" dur="5.93">that way yeah yeah so right now i think</text>
  <text start="483.5" dur="6.639">i&amp;#39;ve probably got over 30 different</text>

  <text start="499.62" dur="5.34">outside the box when it comes to you</text>
  <text start="502.169" dur="6.15">know church and we&amp;#39;re gonna religion and</text>
  <text start="504.96" dur="4.65">some people are pretty conventional and</text>

  <text start="612.66" dur="4.739">different directions and just as one I</text>
  <text start="614.13" dur="5.399">say how do I keep it focused yeah well</text>
  <text start="617.399" dur="3.841">my contribution is going to be just a</text>
  <text start="619.529" dur="3.961">short excerpt from a book I&amp;#39;m writing on</text>
  <text start="621.24" dur="4.05">here in God&amp;#39;s voice and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="623.49" dur="3.39">several of us are approaching this</text>
  <text start="625.29" dur="3.87">Jessie berkey is writing a book and</text>
  <text start="626.88" dur="4.14">hearing God&amp;#39;s voice mark virkler has a</text>
  <text start="629.16" dur="3.72">book on hearing God&amp;#39;s voice and they</text>
  <text start="631.02" dur="5.009">both submitted excerpts from their books</text>
  <text start="632.88" dur="4.62">so for some people this is an excerpt of</text>
  <text start="636.029" dur="3.541">a larger book that I have and for other</text>
  <text start="637.5" dur="5.43">people this is a blog post that I wrote</text>
  <text start="639.57" dur="5.43">or two it can be whatever people want it</text>
  <text start="642.93" dur="3.57">to be yeah I think the book is gonna</text>
  <text start="645" dur="3.24">really going to knock people&amp;#39;s socks off</text>
  <text start="646.5" dur="4.41">and I think it&amp;#39;s going to help clarify</text>
  <text start="648.24" dur="4.469">for a lot of people what Karen God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.91" dur="3.36">voice really is all about I think</text>
  <text start="652.709" dur="3.271">there&amp;#39;s probably three or four people</text>
  <text start="654.27" dur="4.53">who are going to contribute who are</text>
  <text start="655.98" dur="6.9">prophetic feelers from an experience</text>
  <text start="658.8" dur="7.68">they primarily sense revelation from God</text>
  <text start="662.88" dur="6.51">through their senses okay not site right</text>
  <text start="666.48" dur="6.299">and not hearing but through emotions and</text>
  <text start="669.39" dur="5.189">feeling things in their body right and a</text>
  <text start="672.779" dur="3.691">lot of them end up being intercessors</text>
  <text start="674.579" dur="5.25">because i&amp;#39;ll drive through a city and</text>
  <text start="676.47" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;ll feel this oppressive emotion</text>
  <text start="679.829" dur="3.301">that just comes over them when they</text>
  <text start="681.39" dur="4.32">drive through the city a lot of them</text>
  <text start="683.13" dur="4.14">have learned that there&amp;#39;s spirit</text>
  <text start="685.71" dur="4.31">they sensitive to what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="687.27" dur="5.64">that city so they&amp;#39;ll stop and do some</text>
  <text start="690.02" dur="4.48">prayer and sometimes spiritual warfare</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="5.13">and intercession and when they do</text>
  <text start="694.5" dur="5.19">usually those feelings leave yeah so the</text>
  <text start="698.04" dur="3.06">Lord gives them like a prophetic burden</text>
  <text start="699.69" dur="3.33">that they feel in their emotions and</text>
  <text start="701.1" dur="3.3">senses and stuff of that nature so I</text>
  <text start="703.02" dur="3.18">have a number people are going writing</text>
  <text start="704.4" dur="4.43">from that perspective interesting sounds</text>
  <text start="706.2" dur="5.28">like witches and stuff the New Zealand</text>
  <text start="708.83" dur="4.96">yeah a lot of these people are women</text>
  <text start="711.48" dur="4.44">almost all of them actually they say</text>
  <text start="713.79" dur="5.61">that women are intuitive women&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="715.92" dur="5.85">intuition yeah well a lot of these women</text>
  <text start="719.4" dur="5.16">have this spiritual intuition where they</text>
  <text start="721.77" dur="4.23">just know what&amp;#39;s going on in there know</text>
  <text start="724.56" dur="3.84">where they just know things and they</text>
  <text start="726" dur="4.26">feel things and they go with those gut</text>
  <text start="728.4" dur="3.69">feelings and that&amp;#39;s actually the leading</text>
  <text start="730.26" dur="5.1">of the Holy Spirit showing them what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="732.09" dur="5.87">going on so it is pretty interesting I</text>
  <text start="735.36" dur="5.46">think there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that have</text>
  <text start="737.96" dur="5.35">mistaken those feelings that they felt</text>
  <text start="740.82" dur="5.63">for their whole life as feelings of</text>
  <text start="743.31" dur="6">depression yeah and feelings of</text>
  <text start="746.45" dur="5.26">hopelessness and despair that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="749.31" dur="4.92">from them right and not realize it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="751.71" dur="4.2">actually God speaking to them and that</text>
  <text start="754.23" dur="5.31">he&amp;#39;s given them a burden to pray for</text>
  <text start="755.91" dur="5.37">right so it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting and I</text>
  <text start="759.54" dur="5.25">think there&amp;#39;s shift in thinking to</text>
  <text start="761.28" dur="5.04">actually step out and say I&amp;#39;m gonna just</text>
  <text start="764.79" dur="4.02">choose to believe this actually is from</text>
  <text start="766.32" dur="4.83">God and act on it that way you know cuz</text>
  <text start="768.81" dur="3.87">you gotta overcome the heart of love no</text>
  <text start="771.15" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s probably just me and I was making</text>
  <text start="772.68" dur="5.82">it up and yeah reason it&amp;#39;s well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="775.68" dur="4.41">very similar in in some ways to get</text>
  <text start="778.5" dur="4.02">receiving a word of knowledge for pain</text>
  <text start="780.09" dur="3.48">for somebody else yeah like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="782.52" dur="2.16">sitting there in a meeting and all the</text>
  <text start="783.57" dur="4.17">sudden your knee starts hurting like</text>
  <text start="784.68" dur="5.34">crazy like something really bad happened</text>
  <text start="787.74" dur="4.05">to your knee and you could think wow I</text>
  <text start="790.02" dur="3.57">injured by me or you could realize wait</text>
  <text start="791.79" dur="3.57">a minute this is probably the Lord</text>
  <text start="793.59" dur="3.54">telling me something for somebody else</text>
  <text start="795.36" dur="3.39">right well if you understand that</text>
  <text start="797.13" dur="3.42">concept that the Lord will give you a</text>
  <text start="798.75" dur="5.13">feeling in your body that&amp;#39;s for somebody</text>
  <text start="800.55" dur="5.1">else that prophetic feeling and the way</text>
  <text start="803.88" dur="3.66">people sense guide emotionally is very</text>
  <text start="805.65" dur="4.11">similar to that I think I have a</text>
  <text start="807.54" dur="5.82">question for you I was looking at your</text>
  <text start="809.76" dur="6.12">email and you look like you are in</text>
  <text start="813.36" dur="4.74">business for yourself what kind of</text>
  <text start="815.88" dur="3.649">service do you provide for people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="818.1" dur="3.32">like academic tutoring</text>
  <text start="819.529" dur="5.631">usually I work with middle school or</text>
  <text start="821.42" dur="8.01">high schoolers and I help them with</text>
  <text start="825.16" dur="6.76">anything from math to English to honing</text>
  <text start="829.43" dur="4.62">their writing skills okay and then also</text>
  <text start="831.92" dur="4.859">I focus a lot of college entrance stuff</text>
  <text start="834.05" dur="5.399">like the s80 test and writing college</text>
  <text start="836.779" dur="6.091">essays for the applications and all of</text>
  <text start="839.449" dur="6.781">that so well that&amp;#39;s cool yeah I think</text>
  <text start="842.87" dur="6.42">you&amp;#39;re really gonna like Lydia yeah she</text>
  <text start="846.23" dur="5.609">was a composition tutor all the way</text>

  <text start="862.129" dur="3.18">composition in English all the way</text>
  <text start="863.569" dur="3.301">through college and that&amp;#39;s why she</text>
  <text start="865.309" dur="4.171">wanted to become a writer when she got</text>
  <text start="866.87" dur="4.5">out of college she tried being a</text>
  <text start="869.48" dur="4.68">counselor and using her psychology green</text>
  <text start="871.37" dur="4.699">realized this was a big mistake I really</text>
  <text start="874.16" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t have what it takes but she loves</text>
  <text start="876.069" dur="4.601">encouraging and tutoring people in</text>

  <text start="885.74" dur="5.25">what I do is I get to be involved in</text>
  <text start="888.529" dur="5.011">these students lives and the writing or</text>
  <text start="890.99" dur="6.24">the school is like just the doorway in</text>
  <text start="893.54" dur="5.519">you know right now that&amp;#39;s actually a</text>
  <text start="897.23" dur="4.289">really good way to view it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.059" dur="5.64">how I look at my own ministry the</text>
  <text start="901.519" dur="4.771">ambulance is merely a doorway into the</text>
  <text start="904.699" dur="3.901">life of somebody who probably needs</text>
  <text start="906.29" dur="4.649">prayer for something all right right you</text>
