  <text start="70.56" dur="4.47">Muller&amp;#39;s investigation is moving in the</text>
  <text start="73.26" dur="4.62">direction of obstruction of justice and</text>
  <text start="75.03" dur="5.519">that&amp;#39;s actually what andrew mccarthy has</text>

  <text start="92.909" dur="5.311">into potentially prosecuting Trump it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="96.119" dur="5.551">going in the direction of obstruction of</text>
  <text start="98.22" dur="6.109">justice this is a fairly significant</text>
  <text start="101.67" dur="4.979">article I don&amp;#39;t want to make light of it</text>

  <text start="106.649" dur="4.351">article and give you some observations</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="3.57">and we&amp;#39;re going to talk a little bit</text>
  <text start="111" dur="5.46">about some things that we&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="112.35" dur="5.22">discussed on my previous messages so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="116.46" dur="4.049">just gonna read it like the first</text>
  <text start="117.57" dur="4.77">paragraph special counsel robert muller</text>
  <text start="120.509" dur="4.621">is trying to piece together what</text>
  <text start="122.34" dur="6.21">happened inside the White House over a</text>
  <text start="125.13" dur="6.18">critical 18 day period that began when</text>
  <text start="128.55" dur="4.68">senior officials were told that National</text>
  <text start="131.31" dur="2.97">Security Advisor Mike Flynn was</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="4.11">susceptible to black</text>
  <text start="134.28" dur="6.98">male by Russia according to multiple</text>
  <text start="137.34" dur="3.92">people familiar with the matter</text>
  <text start="141.71" dur="10.12">so NBC&amp;#39;s story is based on anonymous</text>
  <text start="147.63" dur="7.26">sources who are leaking information</text>
  <text start="151.83" dur="6.42">about Robert Muller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="154.89" dur="6.06">which is not supposed to be privy to</text>
  <text start="158.25" dur="5.01">anyone it&amp;#39;s supposed to be a closed up</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="3.9">airtight environment and there are</text>
  <text start="163.26" dur="5.31">people leaking information about</text>
  <text start="164.85" dur="6.02">Muller&amp;#39;s investigation to NBC have we</text>
  <text start="168.57" dur="6.36">seen this before</text>
  <text start="170.87" dur="7.42">alright not put this in the back of your</text>
  <text start="174.93" dur="5.91">mind have we seen any recent stories</text>
  <text start="178.29" dur="4.14">where somebody leaked information who</text>
  <text start="180.84" dur="3.42">was on Muller&amp;#39;s team about the</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="4.83">investigation and what happened to them</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="5.729">so here&amp;#39;s some things for you to think</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="5.28">about critical thinking and analysis of</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="6.211">news I&amp;#39;m going to give you some things</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="7.31">to just tuck away when you&amp;#39;re reading</text>
  <text start="196.2" dur="9.33">news stories you&amp;#39;re reading reports okay</text>
  <text start="199.85" dur="8.29">we know that Peter Strock was a member a</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="6.9">high member on Muller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="7.8">team and although the official story is</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="6.119">its truck and his girlfriend Paige were</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="4.92">removed from Muller&amp;#39;s team because they</text>
  <text start="218.549" dur="6.831">were texting back and forth anti-trump</text>
  <text start="220.86" dur="9.3">stuff in fact what happened was struck</text>
  <text start="225.38" dur="7.419">leaked information about the raid on</text>
  <text start="230.16" dur="5.37">manna Ford&amp;#39;s house to the Washington</text>
  <text start="232.799" dur="4.051">Post there was classified information</text>
  <text start="235.53" dur="3.15">that was leaked to The Washington Post</text>
  <text start="236.85" dur="4.02">and struck was the one who did it and</text>
  <text start="238.68" dur="7.2">struck was removed from Muller&amp;#39;s team in</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="7.5">August so here&amp;#39;s the thing the first</text>
  <text start="245.88" dur="6.419">thing to think about is people who have</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="6.42">leaked on Muller&amp;#39;s team information</text>
  <text start="252.299" dur="5.731">about what they&amp;#39;re doing have been</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="6.419">entered in the disciplinary process okay</text>
  <text start="258.03" dur="7.08">and this is something that the</text>
  <text start="261.209" dur="6.371">mainstream media is completely oblivious</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="5.26">to they don&amp;#39;t care</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="4.89">they never report on the consequences of</text>
  <text start="270.37" dur="3.63">what happens to these liquors these</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="3.87">anonymous sources who are licking stuff</text>
  <text start="274" dur="4.439">to the press they never report on what</text>
  <text start="276.34" dur="4.289">happens to these people all they care</text>
  <text start="278.439" dur="4.95">about is getting their juicy details and</text>
  <text start="280.629" dur="4.081">we&amp;#39;re gonna get Trump we got another</text>
  <text start="283.389" dur="6">thing we&amp;#39;re gonna get Trump and they</text>
  <text start="284.71" dur="5.519">don&amp;#39;t realize that these Lakers are in</text>
  <text start="289.389" dur="2.881">big trouble</text>
  <text start="290.229" dur="5.551">they they&amp;#39;re missing the bigger picture</text>
  <text start="292.27" dur="6">so when you look at news articles one</text>
  <text start="295.78" dur="4.949">thing to consider obviously is political</text>
  <text start="298.27" dur="5.489">bias what is the political bias of the</text>
  <text start="300.729" dur="7.41">reporter what is the political bias of</text>
  <text start="303.759" dur="6.21">the you know is it NBC ABC Fox what is</text>
  <text start="308.139" dur="5.4">what is their political bias how far</text>
  <text start="309.969" dur="7.831">left how far right are they do they tend</text>
  <text start="313.539" dur="6.391">to hype things up do they tend to go</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="3.959">down conspiracy roads a lot do they go</text>
  <text start="319.93" dur="3.84">down rabbit trails a lot something else</text>
  <text start="321.759" dur="5.991">to consider how reliable is their</text>
  <text start="323.77" dur="7.949">information how reliable is their past</text>
  <text start="327.75" dur="9.069">reporting on that subject so when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="331.719" dur="6.961">looking at news sources I when somebody</text>
  <text start="336.819" dur="3.21">is reporting on a subject I want to know</text>
  <text start="338.68" dur="5.909">what their track record is on that</text>
  <text start="340.029" dur="6.661">subject when I look at reports on</text>
  <text start="344.589" dur="5.461">uranium 1 and what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="346.69" dur="6.149">uranium 1 I look at people like Sarah</text>
  <text start="350.05" dur="7.289">Carter and John Solomon Sarah Carter and</text>
  <text start="352.839" dur="6.871">John Solomon have a really good track</text>
  <text start="357.339" dur="4.621">record for reporting on uranium 1 why is</text>
  <text start="359.71" dur="4.139">that they&amp;#39;re being fed information from</text>
  <text start="361.96" dur="3.329">the Trump administration Trump&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="363.849" dur="4.35">in his intelligence community are</text>
  <text start="365.289" dur="4.74">feeding the information about uranium 1</text>
  <text start="368.199" dur="3.241">to Sarah Carter and John Solomon they</text>
  <text start="370.029" dur="3.121">have an unfair advantage over everyone</text>
  <text start="371.44" dur="5.969">else so they&amp;#39;re reporting on that</text>
  <text start="373.15" dur="6.54">subject is always good Thomas Paine with</text>
  <text start="377.409" dur="5.1">true pundit has really good sources</text>
  <text start="379.69" dur="6.39">inside the FBI I don&amp;#39;t read a whole lot</text>
  <text start="382.509" dur="5.52">of it articles from Thomas Paine and</text>
  <text start="386.08" dur="4.5">true pundit unless they have to do with</text>
  <text start="388.029" dur="3.901">the FBI when it comes to the FBI I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="390.58" dur="3.809">think there&amp;#39;s anyone who has better</text>
  <text start="391.93" dur="6.06">reporting the Thomas Paine he has good</text>
  <text start="394.389" dur="6.751">sources ok when it comes to</text>
  <text start="397.99" dur="5.61">taxes and what&amp;#39;s going on with tax</text>
  <text start="401.14" dur="5.07">reform there&amp;#39;s two people I rely on for</text>
  <text start="403.6" dur="5.73">my information and Vander Steele and our</text>
  <text start="406.21" dur="4.95">buddy James real person politics those</text>
  <text start="409.33" dur="4.95">two people have really good information</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="5.91">on taxes and business and how the</text>
  <text start="414.28" dur="5.79">government is dealing with taxes so when</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="6.9">I am reading a story one of the things I</text>
  <text start="420.07" dur="6.42">ask myself is is this person a reliable</text>
  <text start="423.97" dur="5.19">source on the subject when I want to</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="5.4">know the ins and outs and the details of</text>
  <text start="429.16" dur="5.22">FISA warrants and the Department of</text>
  <text start="431.89" dur="5.16">Justice and how things work in the DOJ I</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="5.43">go read Andrew McCarthy McCarthy was a</text>
  <text start="437.05" dur="5.46">prosecuting attorney for the DOJ he has</text>
  <text start="439.81" dur="7.14">probably better information on that</text>
  <text start="442.51" dur="7.32">stuff than anybody out there so one</text>
  <text start="446.95" dur="5.79">thing just just to help you be a good</text>
  <text start="449.83" dur="5.37">consumer of news and information is to</text>
  <text start="452.74" dur="4.98">try to find reliable sources don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="455.2" dur="6.33">always go to the same source and believe</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="6.27">and and rely on stories from one source</text>
  <text start="461.53" dur="4.89">because depending on what the subject is</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="5.49">that source may or may not be a reliable</text>
  <text start="466.42" dur="4.02">source of information right so I have a</text>
  <text start="469.48" dur="3.15">lot of different sources</text>
  <text start="470.44" dur="7.77">now one of the things that I&amp;#39;ve noticed</text>
  <text start="472.63" dur="8.37">about NBC ABC CBS and a lot of the</text>
  <text start="478.21" dur="4.38">mainstream liberal media is they have</text>
  <text start="481" dur="4.77">really missed the boat and they have</text>
  <text start="482.59" dur="6.81">done some bad reporting on this Muller</text>
  <text start="485.77" dur="6.48">investigation they have these juicy</text>
  <text start="489.4" dur="5.07">salacious headlines that seem like</text>
  <text start="492.25" dur="5.37">they&amp;#39;re going to bear fruit and then</text>
  <text start="494.47" dur="6.18">inevitably at some point they&amp;#39;re either</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="6.54">proven wrong they have the sources are</text>
  <text start="500.65" dur="6.39">proven wrong or the story gets retracted</text>
  <text start="504.16" dur="5.66">or when you&amp;#39;re looking for good</text>
  <text start="507.04" dur="6.54">information find good sources all right</text>
  <text start="509.82" dur="9.07">so the other thing is anonymous sources</text>
  <text start="513.58" dur="6.84">right the problem with ABC CBS NBC and a</text>
  <text start="518.89" dur="4.38">lot of these mainstream media outlets is</text>
  <text start="520.42" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re using they had these anonymous</text>
  <text start="523.27" dur="5.34">sources right it&amp;#39;s people familiar with</text>
  <text start="526.78" dur="4.69">the matter people familiar with the</text>
  <text start="528.61" dur="4.48">investigation anonymous sources</text>
  <text start="531.47" dur="3.3">that&amp;#39;s one of the big problems of the</text>
  <text start="533.09" dur="5.04">mainstream media is they&amp;#39;re relying</text>
  <text start="534.77" dur="7.8">heavily on unnamed sources and when</text>
  <text start="538.13" dur="6.39">you&amp;#39;re an unnamed source it you are not</text>
  <text start="542.57" dur="4.38">held accountable if your information is</text>
  <text start="544.52" dur="4.17">wrong there is no accountability and</text>
  <text start="546.95" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re finding that out now all these</text>
  <text start="548.69" dur="9.18">news agencies that reported on this</text>
  <text start="551.12" dur="8.76">email about Don jr. and his supposed you</text>
  <text start="557.87" dur="5.55">know that WikiLeaks sent him an email</text>
  <text start="559.88" dur="5.82">giving him inside information ten days</text>
  <text start="563.42" dur="5.19">before everyone else got it turned out</text>
  <text start="565.7" dur="5.31">to be wrong even though three news</text>
  <text start="568.61" dur="5.73">sources reported it and all three of</text>
  <text start="571.01" dur="5.61">them had unnamed sources they all</text>
  <text start="574.34" dur="7.35">misread or they read the date correctly</text>
  <text start="576.62" dur="9.09">but had bad information the media</text>
  <text start="581.69" dur="6.57">outlets are refusing to say who their</text>
  <text start="585.71" dur="5.46">source was so the sources are never held</text>
  <text start="588.26" dur="4.83">accountable by the media now if it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="591.17" dur="4.38">inside source in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="593.09" dur="7.02">community and if that inside source was</text>
  <text start="595.55" dur="9.27">given tainted poisoned incorrect</text>
  <text start="600.11" dur="7.65">information with the intent of exposing</text>
  <text start="604.82" dur="4.5">them as a leaker then they have some</text>
  <text start="607.76" dur="4.56">problems and I think that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="609.32" dur="5.64">on I think the mainstream media has yet</text>
  <text start="612.32" dur="5.1">to figure out that they&amp;#39;re being played</text>
  <text start="614.96" dur="5.37">the media is being played and store</text>
  <text start="617.42" dur="5.37">their sources the sources are being</text>
  <text start="620.33" dur="5.01">given bad information by the</text>
  <text start="622.79" dur="4.11">intelligence community so knowing that</text>
  <text start="625.34" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re gonna take it to the press and</text>
  <text start="626.9" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s going to be proven wrong and then</text>
  <text start="629.48" dur="5.97">the news outlet and the source are both</text>
  <text start="633.08" dur="4.68">exposed sessions has warned them about</text>
  <text start="635.45" dur="5.97">the leaks that is true sessions has set</text>
  <text start="637.76" dur="6">up a task force specifically designed to</text>
  <text start="641.42" dur="5.94">take care of and prosecute and identify</text>
  <text start="643.76" dur="5.07">leakers and I don&amp;#39;t quite understand why</text>
  <text start="647.36" dur="4.14">these people think that they can leak</text>
  <text start="648.83" dur="4.83">and not face prosecution and not face</text>
  <text start="651.5" dur="6">consequences they are going to face</text>
  <text start="653.66" dur="5.46">consequences there&amp;#39;s you can already see</text>
  <text start="657.5" dur="4.29">just the people on Muller&amp;#39;s team are</text>
  <text start="659.12" dur="5.07">facing consequences for leaking so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="661.79" dur="3.53">gonna go on to paragraph two the</text>
  <text start="664.19" dur="3.89">questions</text>
  <text start="665.32" dur="4.53">this is talking about Muller&amp;#39;s team of</text>
  <text start="668.08" dur="6.09">investigators and what they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="669.85" dur="8.58">asking about the questions about what</text>
  <text start="674.17" dur="7.62">happened with respect to Flynn between</text>
  <text start="678.43" dur="6.38">January 26th and Flint&amp;#39;s firing on</text>
  <text start="681.79" dur="5.43">February 13th that 18 day window</text>

  <text start="867.46" dur="6.41">what did Trump know and when did he know</text>
  <text start="870.43" dur="8.7">it and that&amp;#39;s the obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="873.87" dur="7.12">question could hinge on when Trump knew</text>
  <text start="879.13" dur="3.81">about the content of Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="898.66" dur="7.41">the contents of Flynn&amp;#39;s conversation</text>
  <text start="902.02" dur="9.09">with kiss lacquer and did Trump try to</text>
  <text start="906.07" dur="11.01">cover up the lie that when Flynn lied to</text>
  <text start="911.11" dur="8.9">the FBI it&amp;#39;s actually interesting</text>
  <text start="917.08" dur="5.64">because two days after Flynn had his</text>
  <text start="920.01" dur="7.05">dude I think a day or a day or two after</text>
  <text start="922.72" dur="7.02">Flynn was took officially took office as</text>
  <text start="927.06" dur="4.93">national security adviser the next day</text>
  <text start="929.74" dur="2.759">or the day after was when he was</text>

  <text start="932.499" dur="7.53">the FBI now here is where it gets</text>
  <text start="936.039" dur="6.6">interesting okay so there this is where</text>
  <text start="940.029" dur="5.64">the road forks and it diverts and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="942.639" dur="6.36">going in two different directions one</text>
  <text start="945.669" dur="6.18">fork on this road is going to go in the</text>
  <text start="948.999" dur="7.14">direction of oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="951.849" dur="6.57">Trump covered this up oh maybe he lied</text>
  <text start="956.139" dur="3.54">about what maybe he knew Flynn lied and</text>
  <text start="958.419" dur="4.77">didn&amp;#39;t tell anybody who was covering it</text>
  <text start="959.679" dur="4.89">up oh maybe he fired Comey because he</text>
  <text start="963.189" dur="7.7">was covering up all this stuff right</text>
  <text start="964.569" dur="10.38">that&amp;#39;s one road the other road is okay</text>
  <text start="970.889" dur="10.27">we have a problem with this entire</text>
  <text start="974.949" dur="7.92">scenario because when Sally Yates went</text>
  <text start="981.159" dur="5.07">screaming - Don Magan who&amp;#39;s the White</text>
  <text start="982.869" dur="6.75">House Counsel and said Flynn can be</text>
  <text start="986.229" dur="9.15">blackmailed because he lied to the FBI</text>
  <text start="989.619" dur="10.5">and he lied to pence and she is taking</text>
  <text start="995.379" dur="6.78">Flynn statements Flint lied to pence</text>
  <text start="1000.119" dur="4.17">Flint lied to the FBI</text>
  <text start="1002.159" dur="6.45">Flynn&amp;#39;s a liar Flynn can be blackmailed</text>
  <text start="1004.289" dur="8.58">by the Russians Flynn is a liability</text>
  <text start="1008.609" dur="6.66">Trump needs to fire him we can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1012.869" dur="3.39">Flynn as national security adviser he</text>
  <text start="1015.269" dur="2.85">needs to be fired</text>
  <text start="1016.259" dur="5.04">he could be blackmailed by the Russians</text>
  <text start="1018.119" dur="5.88">because he lied okay the entire plot</text>
  <text start="1021.299" dur="5.701">from the very beginning was to get rid</text>
  <text start="1023.999" dur="5.04">of Flynn that&amp;#39;s what the deep state and</text>
  <text start="1027" dur="4.11">Obama administration they wanted to get</text>
  <text start="1029.039" dur="5.55">rid of Flint they didn&amp;#39;t like him they</text>
  <text start="1031.11" dur="7.289">didn&amp;#39;t trust him they knew that he could</text>
  <text start="1034.589" dur="5.04">out all of them so the plan was to get</text>
  <text start="1038.399" dur="5.461">rid of Clinton how are they going to do</text>
  <text start="1039.629" dur="6.3">that the FBI and the DOJ get ahold of</text>
  <text start="1043.86" dur="7.5">their friend over friends over at fusion</text>
  <text start="1045.929" dur="8.671">GPS and they had this dossier this file</text>
  <text start="1051.36" dur="5.399">with information about Trump having</text>
  <text start="1054.6" dur="5.819">Russian hookers peeing on him on a bed</text>
  <text start="1056.759" dur="7.321">that Barack Obama slept in and oh there</text>
  <text start="1060.419" dur="5.041">is this Russian bank that was pinging</text>
  <text start="1064.08" dur="3.39">Trump Tower and his communication</text>
  <text start="1065.46" dur="6.61">between</text>
  <text start="1067.47" dur="7.36">so they go to FISA Court with a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1072.07" dur="4.2">information that suggests that Trump and</text>
  <text start="1074.83" dur="6.66">his whole team are a bunch of Russian</text>

  <text start="1081.49" dur="7.049">the Trump team and the Russian</text>
  <text start="1084.22" dur="6.51">ambassador and they are surveilling</text>
  <text start="1088.539" dur="4.14">Flynn and when Flynn makes a call to</text>
  <text start="1090.73" dur="3.29">kiss Lee Act they get his information</text>
  <text start="1092.679" dur="5.461">they take the data</text>
  <text start="1094.02" dur="5.95">his name is illegally unmasked and the</text>
  <text start="1098.14" dur="3.899">data is given to Sally Yates and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1099.97" dur="5.13">given to everyone else and that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="1102.039" dur="5.25">its daily eighths knows what Flynn said</text>
  <text start="1105.1" dur="3.75">to who and when because it was all being</text>

  <text start="1108.85" dur="5.28">people in the Obama administration now</text>
  <text start="1110.649" dur="5.851">here&amp;#39;s the problem with that there is a</text>

  <text start="1195.97" dur="5.1">it can&amp;#39;t be presented in a trial</text>

  <text start="1201.07" dur="4.71">mainstream media is completely missing</text>
  <text start="1203.56" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s like look you can&amp;#39;t do illegal</text>
  <text start="1205.78" dur="4.32">surveillance on somebody and then think</text>
  <text start="1207.7" dur="4.14">that the evidence you get from that</text>
  <text start="1210.1" dur="3.51">surveillance is going to be admissible</text>
  <text start="1211.84" dur="3.51">in court because any good defense</text>
  <text start="1213.61" dur="3.63">attorneys gonna say look you&amp;#39;ve got this</text>

  <text start="1222.43" dur="6.27">they&amp;#39;re all listening I&amp;#39;m like look none</text>

  <text start="1381.76" dur="6">this innuendo and there&amp;#39;s all these</text>
  <text start="1384.25" dur="7.02">unnamed sources that that know that this</text>
  <text start="1387.76" dur="6.659">investigation is moving toward nailing</text>
  <text start="1391.27" dur="4.14">Trump for obstructing justice because he</text>
  <text start="1394.419" dur="6.211">fired Comey</text>
  <text start="1395.41" dur="8.19">because Comey was going to take Trump</text>
  <text start="1400.63" dur="3.419">down even though Comey has said three</text>
  <text start="1403.6" dur="3.09">times</text>
  <text start="1404.049" dur="8.071">I remember Trump was never under</text>
  <text start="1406.69" dur="8.51">investigation by the FBI and so what was</text>
  <text start="1412.12" dur="5.91">what a what obstruction of justice if</text>
  <text start="1415.2" dur="7">the president wasn&amp;#39;t under investigation</text>
  <text start="1418.03" dur="5.76">and he fired the FBI director then how</text>
  <text start="1422.2" dur="3.359">do you say he obstructed justice</text>
  <text start="1423.79" dur="3.18">well because Jean interfered an</text>
  <text start="1425.559" dur="4.351">investigation there was no investigation</text>
  <text start="1426.97" dur="4.98">he wasn&amp;#39;t under investigation what was</text>
  <text start="1429.91" dur="5.94">under investigation was not the</text>
  <text start="1431.95" dur="6.92">president Mahler&amp;#39;s investigation is not</text>
  <text start="1435.85" dur="4.98">an investigation of the president I</text>
  <text start="1438.87" dur="4.809">don&amp;#39;t know how many times you can say</text>
  <text start="1440.83" dur="5.719">this but that investigation that Muller</text>
  <text start="1443.679" dur="5.611">is doing is it is an election</text>
  <text start="1446.549" dur="5.681">investigation it is an investigation</text>
  <text start="1449.29" dur="6.6">that is looking into whether or not</text>
  <text start="1452.23" dur="5.939">Russia interfered with the election it</text>
  <text start="1455.89" dur="4.2">is not a Trump investigation it is</text>
  <text start="1458.169" dur="3.691">looking at whether on Hillary</text>
  <text start="1460.09" dur="5.37">side or Trump&amp;#39;s side somebody interfered</text>
  <text start="1461.86" dur="7.38">with the investigation and it could be</text>
  <text start="1465.46" dur="8.91">on either side now I will say this this</text>
  <text start="1469.24" dur="7.35">is something that if you&amp;#39;re if you are</text>
  <text start="1474.37" dur="5.25">of the opinion that Muller is a black</text>
  <text start="1476.59" dur="6.689">hat and Muller is representing the</text>
  <text start="1479.62" dur="6">interests of the deep state then you are</text>
  <text start="1483.279" dur="4.5">likely to believe that this</text>
  <text start="1485.62" dur="4.5">investigation is trying to nail Trump</text>
  <text start="1487.779" dur="4.441">and that they will eventually charge him</text>
  <text start="1490.12" dur="3.689">with obstruction of justice that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="1492.22" dur="4.17">of the path that you&amp;#39;re going down if</text>
  <text start="1493.809" dur="4.441">you think Muller is a black hat then</text>
  <text start="1496.39" dur="3.12">eventually he&amp;#39;s gonna want to charge</text>
  <text start="1498.25" dur="6.12">Trump with something like probably</text>
  <text start="1499.51" dur="7.68">obstruction if you believe that Muller</text>
  <text start="1504.37" dur="7.65">is either neutral or Muller is a white</text>
  <text start="1507.19" dur="7.67">hat then you&amp;#39;re likely to believe that</text>
  <text start="1512.02" dur="6.75">the people who are actually more guilty</text>
  <text start="1514.86" dur="5.439">are the Obama administration because</text>
  <text start="1518.77" dur="7.289">they were illegally unmasking they</text>
  <text start="1520.299" dur="9.151">probably used illegal evidence for as a</text>
  <text start="1526.059" dur="7.35">basis for the FISA warrant this is</text>
  <text start="1529.45" dur="8.25">interesting to me if if this report that</text>
  <text start="1533.409" dur="5.971">NBC has is true and if these people who</text>
  <text start="1537.7" dur="3.99">are reporting this information are</text>
  <text start="1539.38" dur="5.669">actually on Mahler&amp;#39;s team and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1541.69" dur="5.67">actually correct about the fact that</text>
  <text start="1545.049" dur="6.681">Muller is looking into that 18 day</text>
  <text start="1547.36" dur="6.569">window of what happened when Flynn was</text>
  <text start="1551.73" dur="4.09">sworn in and what happened when Flynn</text>
  <text start="1553.929" dur="3.451">had his conversation with kis lyac and</text>
  <text start="1555.82" dur="2.82">then at the time what all happened</text>
  <text start="1557.38" dur="3.539">before he was fired</text>
  <text start="1558.64" dur="6.3">if Muller is looking into that time</text>
  <text start="1560.919" dur="7.281">frame it&amp;#39;s possible that he is actually</text>
  <text start="1564.94" dur="9.859">looking to find out what was going on</text>
  <text start="1568.2" dur="10.209">with Obama&amp;#39;s National Security Council</text>
  <text start="1574.799" dur="8.321">what were Susan Rice and Ben Rhodes and</text>
  <text start="1578.409" dur="7.291">clapper and Brennan doing who had they</text>
  <text start="1583.12" dur="6.179">unmasked what information had they</text>
  <text start="1585.7" dur="5.19">shared with the press see there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="1589.299" dur="4.281">ways this could go Muller could be</text>
  <text start="1590.89" dur="4.98">investigating Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1593.58" dur="5.35">National Security Council and his staff</text>
  <text start="1595.87" dur="6.15">or Muller could be investigating Trump</text>
  <text start="1598.93" dur="7.65">and Flynn and hence death we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1602.02" dur="7.14">we don&amp;#39;t know so there&amp;#39;s two possible</text>
  <text start="1606.58" dur="4.98">ways this could go if this information</text>
  <text start="1609.16" dur="5.1">is correct if that is what Muller&amp;#39;s team</text>
  <text start="1611.56" dur="5.01">is focusing on he could either be</text>
  <text start="1614.26" dur="3.84">looking at a nailing some people in the</text>
  <text start="1616.57" dur="3.66">Obama administration or he could be</text>
  <text start="1618.1" dur="6.26">looking at nailing Trump we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1620.23" dur="6.36">at this point do we but you have these</text>
  <text start="1624.36" dur="4.27">unnamed sources who are giving this</text>
  <text start="1626.59" dur="5.85">information they think they know where</text>
  <text start="1628.63" dur="5.01">what Muller&amp;#39;s team is doing I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1632.44" dur="3.18">going to be very interesting to see</text>
  <text start="1633.64" dur="7.11">where this all goes I don&amp;#39;t know where</text>
  <text start="1635.62" dur="6.66">it&amp;#39;s gonna go there there are gonna be</text>
  <text start="1640.75" dur="5.49">some people that are gonna take a fall</text>
  <text start="1642.28" dur="7.02">I&amp;#39;ll say that if Muller closes up his</text>
  <text start="1646.24" dur="5.58">investigation and doesn&amp;#39;t charge Trump</text>
  <text start="1649.3" dur="5.07">and doesn&amp;#39;t charge any Obama</text>
  <text start="1651.82" dur="3.12">administration he just closes up and</text>
  <text start="1654.37" dur="4.02">he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="1654.94" dur="5.31">I suspect that Chris Rea and sessions</text>
  <text start="1658.39" dur="3.3">will go after the other people and</text>
  <text start="1660.25" dur="3.72">they&amp;#39;ll sort it all out and it&amp;#39;ll be a</text>
  <text start="1661.69" dur="6.15">bunch of people indicted more than</text>
  <text start="1663.97" dur="6.3">likely it&amp;#39;s gonna be interesting to see</text>
  <text start="1667.84" dur="5.4">how this all plays out and the thing is</text>
  <text start="1670.27" dur="6.33">you know it&amp;#39;s going to be very difficult</text>
  <text start="1673.24" dur="6.09">to charge the president with obstruction</text>
  <text start="1676.6" dur="6.72">Alan Dershowitz and Andrew McCarthy and</text>
  <text start="1679.33" dur="5.87">some very sound legal minds have said it</text>
  <text start="1683.32" dur="3.78">is going to be almost impossible to</text>
  <text start="1685.2" dur="4.03">prosecute the president or charge him</text>
  <text start="1687.1" dur="3.72">with obstruction because you know first</text>
  <text start="1689.23" dur="3.66">of all it&amp;#39;s perfectly within his rights</text>
  <text start="1690.82" dur="4.64">as president to fire anybody that he</text>
  <text start="1692.89" dur="5.51">wants to that is on the executive branch</text>
  <text start="1695.46" dur="6.76">side of things and that&amp;#39;s DOJ and FBI</text>
  <text start="1698.4" dur="5.32">right he has he can fire FBI director he</text>
  <text start="1702.22" dur="5.61">can fire the Attorney General for no</text>
  <text start="1703.72" dur="7.59">reason at all and there the case for</text>
  <text start="1707.83" dur="5.58">obstruction is really weak I know one</text>
  <text start="1711.31" dur="4.7">that I know who who has a legal</text>
  <text start="1713.41" dur="5.76">expertise is taking that seriously</text>
  <text start="1716.01" dur="8.49">so yeah waste of time and money probably</text>
  <text start="1719.17" dur="7.639">true probably true all righty</text>
  <text start="1724.5" dur="5.549">no more questions</text>
  <text start="1726.809" dur="6.09">I&amp;#39;m gonna head out I&amp;#39;ll keep doing my</text>
  <text start="1730.049" dur="6.09">research oh by the way if you like this</text>
