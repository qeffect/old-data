  <text start="78.15" dur="5.399">interesting that the Full Gospel</text>
  <text start="80.329" dur="6.97">businessmen&amp;#39;s Association is essentially</text>
  <text start="83.549" dur="5.191">a layman&amp;#39;s Association and it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="87.299" dur="5.18">appropriate I think for me to be</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="8.76">speaking to laymen because I am one I</text>
  <text start="92.479" dur="8.111">want to dispel some misconceptions</text>
  <text start="97.5" dur="5.789">people have about me I hate it when</text>
  <text start="100.59" dur="4.889">people call me the man of God I feel</text>
  <text start="103.289" dur="4.801">like I&amp;#39;m just like everybody else just</text>
  <text start="105.479" dur="6.03">an average guy I work an average job I</text>

  <text start="126.719" dur="6.751">College I&amp;#39;ve only spoken publicly a few</text>
  <text start="129.539" dur="7.471">times I am in every way a layperson very</text>
  <text start="133.47" dur="6.96">much in the way that CS Lewis was a lay</text>
  <text start="137.01" dur="6.27">person so if you go on Wikipedia and you</text>
  <text start="140.43" dur="6.38">look up CS Lewis you will see that they</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="7.84">actually qualify him as a lay theologian</text>
  <text start="146.81" dur="7.52">his contemporaries a a alan wiglesworth</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="4.58">and all the men of God who were going</text>
  <text start="154.33" dur="4.73">and doing the signs and wonders and</text>
  <text start="155.7" dur="8.17">filling stadiums and going overseas they</text>
  <text start="159.06" dur="7.539">brought an amazing work of God in the</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="5.78">way that they were called to do it but</text>
  <text start="166.599" dur="7.381">Louis knew his calling was different</text>
  <text start="169.65" dur="6.72">because Louis never graduated Babel</text>
  <text start="173.98" dur="6.6">college was never ordained as a minister</text>
  <text start="176.37" dur="6.85">never went on missions overseas did not</text>
  <text start="180.58" dur="5.58">fill stadiums did not go to meetings and</text>
  <text start="183.22" dur="6.84">see people heal and delivered he taught</text>
  <text start="186.16" dur="6.81">literature at Oxford and Cambridge he</text>
  <text start="190.06" dur="5.34">had a regular job went to work taught</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="7.109">literature and wrote some very amazing</text>
  <text start="195.4" dur="7.83">books and in his own unique way he</text>
  <text start="200.079" dur="6.69">influenced a generation powerfully the</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="6.66">Lord spoke to me in in through actually</text>
  <text start="206.769" dur="5.911">through a dream that my wife had where</text>
  <text start="209.89" dur="5.939">he essentially said that he&amp;#39;s giving me</text>
  <text start="212.68" dur="6">something like that he intends to use me</text>
  <text start="215.829" dur="6.541">as a layman I have no intention of going</text>
  <text start="218.68" dur="6.96">to Bible College or seminary the Holy</text>
  <text start="222.37" dur="6.9">Spirit is a very very good teacher</text>
  <text start="225.64" dur="6.24">he can teach you things that will blow</text>
  <text start="229.27" dur="6.57">your mind and he is the best teacher</text>
  <text start="231.88" dur="5.85">that there is nothing wrong with men of</text>
  <text start="235.84" dur="3.51">God who teach but the Holy Spirit can</text>
  <text start="237.73" dur="5.16">teach you everything you need to know</text>
  <text start="239.35" dur="9.2">and he can untie to stuff you don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="8.43">to know which brings me to my testimony</text>
  <text start="248.55" dur="5.86">and I brought I said all of that because</text>
  <text start="251.32" dur="5.19">what I&amp;#39;m going to talk about you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="254.41" dur="5.79">going to think oh my gosh he&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="256.51" dur="8.1">amazing anointed gifted man of God no</text>
  <text start="260.2" dur="9.51">he&amp;#39;s not I am NOT I am an average normal</text>
  <text start="264.61" dur="9.24">person I actually grew up in a large</text>
  <text start="269.71" dur="8.6">Midwestern family in Wisconsin we were</text>
  <text start="273.85" dur="7.97">Catholic and at the age of about 12 I</text>
  <text start="278.31" dur="5.65">pretty much had my fill of religion I</text>
  <text start="281.82" dur="5.26">told my parents I wasn&amp;#39;t going to mass</text>
  <text start="283.96" dur="5.16">anymore I had no interest in religion I</text>
  <text start="287.08" dur="4.38">had no interest in God didn&amp;#39;t it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="289.12" dur="4.14">interested in church and I essentially</text>
  <text start="291.46" dur="4.59">told my parents I am NOT going to mass</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="5.76">anymore and you cannot make me and I</text>
  <text start="296.05" dur="5.67">turned my back on the church and I never</text>
  <text start="299.02" dur="8.01">thought about it again until the age of</text>
  <text start="301.72" dur="6.87">38 now when I got into high school and</text>
  <text start="307.03" dur="3.949">then later college I became very</text>
  <text start="308.59" dur="7.05">interested in science biology chemistry</text>
  <text start="310.979" dur="7.151">and I realized that there was a theory</text>
  <text start="315.64" dur="5.85">called evolution which was proposed by</text>
  <text start="318.13" dur="7.41">Darwin and my professors were very big</text>
  <text start="321.49" dur="6.51">on Darwinism and so was I so I became a</text>
  <text start="325.54" dur="5.64">Darwinist and I became a very convinced</text>
  <text start="328" dur="5.7">Darwinist I was very convinced evolution</text>
  <text start="331.18" dur="6.359">was true and I was absolutely convinced</text>
  <text start="333.7" dur="5.82">there was no God I lived most of my</text>
  <text start="337.539" dur="6.601">adult life as an atheist and I was very</text>
  <text start="339.52" dur="5.97">happy not believing in God not only did</text>
  <text start="344.14" dur="5.55">I not believe in God</text>
  <text start="345.49" dur="6.12">I was very hostile to Christians I hated</text>
  <text start="349.69" dur="5.909">Christians and I hated Jesus with a</text>
  <text start="351.61" dur="5.11">passion even I couldn&amp;#39;t even say the</text>
  <text start="355.599" dur="3.701">name of Jesus</text>
  <text start="356.72" dur="6.6">without having this feeling of disgust</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="8.03">and loathing that&amp;#39;s how far from God I</text>
  <text start="363.32" dur="14.1">was and I lived that way until I was 38</text>
  <text start="367.33" dur="12.82">which wasn&amp;#39;t that long ago just saying I</text>
  <text start="377.42" dur="6.93">was working at a fire department in the</text>
  <text start="380.15" dur="9.15">northwest near Olympia Washington and I</text>
  <text start="384.35" dur="8.22">had promised myself when I took a job as</text>
  <text start="389.3" dur="7.5">a firefighter paramedic that I was not</text>
  <text start="392.57" dur="6.6">going to become a Paragon so Paragon is</text>
  <text start="396.8" dur="5.1">a paramedic who has an ego the size of</text>
  <text start="399.17" dur="3.51">this building it thinks he can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="401.9" dur="2.91">anything wrong</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="6.39">he&amp;#39;s always right makes all the right</text>
  <text start="404.81" dur="6.75">calls that was everything and in about</text>
  <text start="409.07" dur="4.14">five years I became a very arrogant</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="5.78">Paragon who thought he knew everything</text>
  <text start="413.21" dur="11.34">he was never wrong always had everything</text>
  <text start="417.34" dur="8.56">in a running well my pride caused me to</text>
  <text start="424.55" dur="3.869">start having problems with my paramedic</text>
  <text start="425.9" dur="5.85">partner that I was working with and we</text>
  <text start="428.419" dur="5.701">started to have some serious personality</text>
  <text start="431.75" dur="4.8">problems to the point where we were best</text>
  <text start="434.12" dur="6.57">friends for a while and then we became</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="8.31">worst enemies and this went on for a</text>
  <text start="440.69" dur="8.16">while and one day I decided that it had</text>
  <text start="444.86" dur="6.57">to end so I apologized for being a proud</text>
  <text start="448.85" dur="5.16">and arrogant person I admitted to him</text>
  <text start="451.43" dur="5.43">that I was wrong he was right and I</text>
  <text start="454.01" dur="7.469">asked for his forgiveness and when I did</text>
  <text start="456.86" dur="9.24">that something inside of me changed and</text>
  <text start="461.479" dur="8.25">I broke down in tears and I just wept</text>
  <text start="466.1" dur="6.02">for quite a long time and that was the</text>
  <text start="469.729" dur="6.361">beginning of something different</text>

  <text start="627.81" dur="4.23">like a really bad guy in his own mind</text>
  <text start="629.61" dur="4.8">you know he wasn&amp;#39;t like an axe murderer</text>

  <text start="664.83" dur="7.62">gospel of God&amp;#39;s grace and love was woven</text>
  <text start="668.4" dur="5.01">into this story and now growing up in</text>
  <text start="672.45" dur="2.79">the Catholic Church</text>
  <text start="673.41" dur="3.36">I knew all about Jesus I knew about his</text>
  <text start="675.24" dur="4.83">death I knew about his resurrection I</text>
  <text start="676.77" dur="4.38">knew about the fact that he died to</text>
  <text start="680.07" dur="3.78">forgive the sins in the world</text>
  <text start="681.15" dur="4.05">I knew that intellectually I just had</text>
  <text start="683.85" dur="4.71">rejected at my whole life it had never</text>
  <text start="685.2" dur="8.19">been something personal for me a reading</text>
  <text start="688.56" dur="7.5">this book the Holy Spirit came into the</text>
  <text start="693.39" dur="5.34">fire station into my bunk room and</text>
  <text start="696.06" dur="7.2">started speaking to this to me as a</text>
  <text start="698.73" dur="8.52">personal message for me so for the first</text>
  <text start="703.26" dur="8.79">time the death of Jesus became something</text>
  <text start="707.25" dur="7.35">that was relevant to me and I I</text>
  <text start="712.05" dur="6.15">struggled with that and I kept reading</text>
  <text start="714.6" dur="5.64">the book and as I did the Lord started</text>
  <text start="718.2" dur="5.04">to bring up all the junk from my past</text>
  <text start="720.24" dur="4.86">all the lies all the sins he drank got</text>
  <text start="723.24" dur="3.51">all my skeletons on a closet just threw</text>
  <text start="725.1" dur="3.18">him on the floor he said okay now you</text>
  <text start="726.75" dur="7.35">think you&amp;#39;re a good person what about</text>

  <text start="1557.07" dur="4.979">white was a drug addict and he did not</text>
  <text start="1559.98" dur="5.579">believe in God he had so much unbelief</text>
  <text start="1562.049" dur="5.671">and skepticism it took a while for him</text>
  <text start="1565.559" dur="5.131">to build faith for healing for the</text>
  <text start="1567.72" dur="6">miraculous but once he got it he got it</text>
  <text start="1570.69" dur="5.579">Pete Cabrera same deal Pete prayed for</text>
  <text start="1573.72" dur="6.829">hundreds of people never saw anybody</text>

  <text start="1580.549" dur="7.33">he had so much skepticism doubt unbelief</text>
  <text start="1584.509" dur="5.29">he had to get his mind renewed to the</text>
  <text start="1587.879" dur="4.68">fact that God wanted to heal people and</text>
  <text start="1589.799" dur="5.671">it takes time for that to happen me I</text>
  <text start="1592.559" dur="5.761">was an atheist I didn&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="1595.47" dur="5.61">miracles and God said I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="1598.32" dur="5.699">miracles it took me a period of about</text>
  <text start="1601.08" dur="5.4">six months for my mind to get renewed</text>
  <text start="1604.019" dur="3.931">and for me to develop faith</text>
  <text start="1606.48" dur="6.18">to where people were start to get healed</text>
  <text start="1607.95" dur="6.63">now I have a friend Matt Evans who has</text>
  <text start="1612.66" dur="4.17">been a a believer pretty much his whole</text>
  <text start="1614.58" dur="5.69">life he&amp;#39;s raised in the church went to</text>
  <text start="1616.83" dur="7.31">Bethel when he was 19 came out of their</text>
  <text start="1620.27" dur="5.08">first few people he prayed for miracles</text>
  <text start="1624.14" dur="3.1">deliverance</text>
  <text start="1625.35" dur="4.11">he&amp;#39;s prayed for bald people and seen</text>
  <text start="1627.24" dur="5.189">hair grow out on their head he has seen</text>
  <text start="1629.46" dur="4.709">so much cool stuff never had that period</text>
  <text start="1632.429" dur="3.931">where he was praying and nobody got</text>
  <text start="1634.169" dur="4.351">healed because he didn&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="1636.36" dur="4.949">skepticism and unbelief that the rest of</text>
  <text start="1638.52" dur="6.09">us had if you&amp;#39;re starting from a place</text>
  <text start="1641.309" dur="5.25">where you have faith and you believe in</text>
  <text start="1644.61" dur="4.26">the supernatural you are not going to</text>
  <text start="1646.559" dur="5.691">have to go through hundreds of people to</text>
  <text start="1648.87" dur="8.1">get them healed you should start off</text>
  <text start="1652.25" dur="6.309">seeing miracles relatively quickly it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1656.97" dur="3.57">the rest of us knuckleheads that have to</text>
  <text start="1658.559" dur="4.021">suffer through hundreds and hundreds of</text>
  <text start="1660.54" dur="6.87">people not being healed that&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="1662.58" dur="6.479">way it is so once I saw my first well my</text>
  <text start="1667.41" dur="3.99">first miracle I think was a migraine</text>
  <text start="1669.059" dur="4.651">headache I was at a grocery store it was</text>
  <text start="1671.4" dur="8.399">a really hot day and I wanted to get</text>
  <text start="1673.71" dur="7.26">some Gatorade and there was a lady at</text>
  <text start="1679.799" dur="3.661">the checkout stand</text>
  <text start="1680.97" dur="4.68">and for some reason I looked down and I</text>
  <text start="1683.46" dur="5.01">close my eyes and I saw it in my mind&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1685.65" dur="5.73">eye an image of her and the word</text>
  <text start="1688.47" dur="4.589">headaches and now I&amp;#39;m not the smartest</text>
  <text start="1691.38" dur="2.73">person in the world but I kind of</text>
  <text start="1693.059" dur="6.181">figured that might be a word of</text>
  <text start="1694.11" dur="6.689">knowledge well she was actually an</text>
  <text start="1699.24" dur="3.51">employee at the store she worked in the</text>
  <text start="1700.799" dur="3.421">bakery she was getting something she</text>

  <text start="1729.48" dur="4.189">asked the Lord when are you going to</text>
  <text start="1731.309" dur="2.36">heal me</text>
  <text start="1735.63" dur="7.45">that&amp;#39;s why she was crying so I said yeah</text>
  <text start="1739.84" dur="4.07">let&amp;#39;s just pray so put my hand in her</text>

  <text start="1746.17" dur="7.77">said how do you feel she goes headaches</text>
  <text start="1749.86" dur="9.42">gone completely like that was gone first</text>
  <text start="1753.94" dur="9.36">miracle God can take people who are very</text>
  <text start="1759.28" dur="7.47">unhip &amp;#39;td untalented full of skepticism</text>
  <text start="1763.3" dur="6.33">and doubt untrained and he can do</text>
  <text start="1766.75" dur="5.28">miracles to them if they simply believe</text>
  <text start="1769.63" dur="6.15">he&amp;#39;s going to do what he said he was</text>
  <text start="1772.03" dur="6.72">going to do at that point I was reaching</text>
  <text start="1775.78" dur="5.19">a transition in my faith whereas</text>
  <text start="1778.75" dur="6.66">actually starting to think God is going</text>
  <text start="1780.97" dur="7.74">to eventually heal someone and with this</text>
  <text start="1785.41" dur="6.45">lady the word of knowledge jacked up my</text>
  <text start="1788.71" dur="4.59">faith I was like oh he is definitely</text>
  <text start="1791.86" dur="3.96">gonna heal her I got a word of knowledge</text>
  <text start="1793.3" dur="4.65">I was like one of my first ones I was</text>

  <text start="1797.95" dur="6.41">go lay my hands that he is gonna heal</text>
  <text start="1799.39" dur="11.69">her see for me faith is almost</text>
  <text start="1804.36" dur="8.56">synonymous with confidence at one point</text>
  <text start="1811.08" dur="4.72">Denise and I were going out to</text>
  <text start="1812.92" dur="5.49">restaurants and grocery stores and we</text>
  <text start="1815.8" dur="4.38">were praying for people who were had</text>
  <text start="1818.41" dur="4.14">crutches and immobilizers and</text>
  <text start="1820.18" dur="4.17">wheelchairs and stuff and walk up to</text>
  <text start="1822.55" dur="3.63">people who had a sling on their shoulder</text>
  <text start="1824.35" dur="3.74">and I would ask him if they had a</text>
  <text start="1826.18" dur="5.94">shoulder problem and they&amp;#39;re like yeah</text>
  <text start="1828.09" dur="7.48">frozen shoulder torn rotator cuff I&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="1832.12" dur="5.28">like okay can I pray for you and I would</text>
  <text start="1835.57" dur="4.32">say yeah so I put my hand up there</text>
  <text start="1837.4" dur="4.2">command the ligaments and the tendons</text>
  <text start="1839.89" dur="4.19">and the rotator cuff and the cartilage</text>
  <text start="1841.6" dur="6.09">to be healing and they could healed and</text>
  <text start="1844.08" dur="6.7">I saw like three of those people healed</text>
  <text start="1847.69" dur="4.41">in a row and then I thought it was 10</text>
  <text start="1850.78" dur="3.96">feet tall and bulletproof I was like</text>
  <text start="1852.1" dur="5.1">okay I had the shoulder he anointing</text>
  <text start="1854.74" dur="5.81">whatever I was like I had so much</text>
  <text start="1857.2" dur="7.41">confidence like migraines not so much</text>
  <text start="1860.55" dur="5.83">blown out knees not yet but I felt like</text>
  <text start="1864.61" dur="2.9">if I had somebody with a shoulder injury</text>
  <text start="1866.38" dur="3.4">I</text>
  <text start="1867.51" dur="5.43">God is gonna heal them I knew it and</text>
  <text start="1869.78" dur="5.5">literally I would see like 13 or 14</text>
  <text start="1872.94" dur="4.14">people in a row with frozen shoulders</text>
  <text start="1875.28" dur="3.89">and torn rotator cuffs healed every</text>
  <text start="1877.08" dur="6.9">single one of them Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam</text>
  <text start="1879.17" dur="8.64">because I had prayed for a few of them</text>
  <text start="1883.98" dur="8.64">got to a point where my faith my</text>
  <text start="1887.81" dur="7.3">confidence in God was so strong no doubt</text>
  <text start="1892.62" dur="3.84">no skepticism nothing I was like I know</text>
  <text start="1895.11" dur="4.47">if you let me pray for you you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1896.46" dur="5.46">getting healed if it was a shoulder now</text>
  <text start="1899.58" dur="4.83">something else not so much but then but</text>
  <text start="1901.92" dur="5.85">then I started praying for a lot of</text>
  <text start="1904.41" dur="6.11">knees torn meniscus torn ligaments in</text>
  <text start="1907.77" dur="5.55">the knees and the same thing happened I</text>
  <text start="1910.52" dur="5.98">started seeing one person after another</text>
  <text start="1913.32" dur="5.25">healed and then I got this confidence</text>
  <text start="1916.5" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m like holy moly there&amp;#39;s another knee</text>

  <text start="1932.4" dur="5.94">expectation of things not see you know</text>
  <text start="1935.99" dur="5.56">that&amp;#39;s a thing it&amp;#39;s a confident</text>
  <text start="1938.34" dur="7.38">expectation that when you pray for</text>
  <text start="1941.55" dur="7.56">someone God is going to heal without</text>

  <text start="1958.32" dur="5.76">miraculous it&amp;#39;s getting a couple of</text>
  <text start="1960.81" dur="6.6">victories and then realizing God really</text>
  <text start="1964.08" dur="5.12">wants to do this stuff it&amp;#39;s not like he</text>
  <text start="1967.41" dur="3.72">is sitting up there shaking the dice</text>

  <text start="2186.18" dur="3.78">thought okay time to take it out for a</text>
  <text start="2187.92" dur="5.13">test drive so took it down to the stop</text>
  <text start="2189.96" dur="6.149">sign and just drove it around and it ran</text>
  <text start="2193.05" dur="4.65">great it would always hesitate then</text>
  <text start="2196.109" dur="4.111">sometimes stall going through</text>
  <text start="2197.7" dur="5.1">intersections when I would decelerate</text>

  <text start="2569.39" dur="3.78">feel like I had enough revelation to</text>
  <text start="2571.46" dur="2.94">write up book and seeing this Burt and</text>
  <text start="2573.17" dur="5.31">Michael had already written a really</text>
  <text start="2574.4" dur="6.69">good book but the larvas like no you</text>
  <text start="2578.48" dur="4.71">have unique revelation and a way of</text>
  <text start="2581.09" dur="4.47">explaining this stuff that people can</text>
  <text start="2583.19" dur="6.57">understand who may not be able to</text>
  <text start="2585.56" dur="9.39">understand his book so it&amp;#39;s like okay so</text>
  <text start="2589.76" dur="8.25">that day I sat down at work and we&amp;#39;re oh</text>
  <text start="2594.95" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s answered your question I do a lot</text>
  <text start="2598.01" dur="3.48">of writing at work between calls so when</text>
  <text start="2600.14" dur="4.11">I have quiet days or there&amp;#39;s not a lot</text>
  <text start="2601.49" dur="4.38">of calls going on I&amp;#39;m writing writing</text>
  <text start="2604.25" dur="5.39">writing writing I take my laptop with me</text>
  <text start="2605.87" dur="6.57">everywhere I go and and if I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2609.64" dur="4.24">engaged with somebody I&amp;#39;m often writing</text>
  <text start="2612.44" dur="2.52">in the ambulance I&amp;#39;ll be tooling down</text>
  <text start="2613.88" dur="2.97">the freeway we&amp;#39;re going between</text>
  <text start="2614.96" dur="3.69">hospitals and I&amp;#39;m on my computer just</text>
  <text start="2616.85" dur="5.04">writing writing reading as I get</text>
  <text start="2618.65" dur="5.67">inspired to write stuff I just get it</text>
  <text start="2621.89" dur="4.98">all down on the computer so that day I</text>
  <text start="2624.32" dur="5.16">started writing basically I would sit</text>
  <text start="2626.87" dur="4.56">down for about a half hour and I was</text>
  <text start="2629.48" dur="6.05">asking the Lord okay seeing the spirit</text>
  <text start="2631.43" dur="7.05">how does this work what do I need to</text>
  <text start="2635.53" dur="6.97">write to help people understand how this</text>
  <text start="2638.48" dur="5.55">works the mechanics the practical rubber</text>
  <text start="2642.5" dur="3.36">meets the road how does this work</text>
  <text start="2644.03" dur="3.51">and so the Holy Spirit would just</text>
  <text start="2645.86" dur="4.29">basically give me these thought</text>
  <text start="2647.54" dur="4.34">impressions and I would dictate what he</text>
  <text start="2650.15" dur="4.08">was saying I would just type it all out</text>
  <text start="2651.88" dur="4.39">that would last for 20 minutes - half</text>
  <text start="2654.23" dur="3.99">hour and then I would run dry I just</text>
  <text start="2656.27" dur="4.11">wouldn&amp;#39;t have any more revelation so I</text>
  <text start="2658.22" dur="4.78">go walk around the station for a while</text>
  <text start="2660.38" dur="4.72">and take a break</text>
  <text start="2663" dur="4.29">and then I&amp;#39;d come back to it about an</text>
  <text start="2665.1" dur="4.89">hour later I don&amp;#39;t have more revelation</text>
  <text start="2667.29" dur="6.75">now this is how the Holy Spirit works</text>
  <text start="2669.99" dur="7.77">with me many times when I sit down at</text>
  <text start="2674.04" dur="6.3">the computer I just steal my soul I get</text>
  <text start="2677.76" dur="5.28">quiet and a silent spirit okay</text>
  <text start="2680.34" dur="6.06">teach me and what do you teaches me what</text>
  <text start="2683.04" dur="6.12">I hear in my spirit I just write out its</text>
  <text start="2686.4" dur="4.35">writing under the anointing it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="2689.16" dur="4.2">similar to doing ministry where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2690.75" dur="5.46">praying for people and your ask Lord for</text>

  <text start="3455.049" dur="4.621">one</text>
  <text start="3455.73" dur="5.77">that night I have a dream or some kind</text>
  <text start="3459.67" dur="4.17">of experience where I see a man standing</text>
  <text start="3461.5" dur="6.23">in front of me and he has a surgical</text>
  <text start="3463.84" dur="7.26">incision in his right below his rib cage</text>
  <text start="3467.73" dur="6.82">about eight inches long and it&amp;#39;s open</text>
  <text start="3471.1" dur="7.98">and I walk over to him and I know in the</text>
  <text start="3474.55" dur="6.69">dream he needs a new kidney so I walk</text>
  <text start="3479.08" dur="4.71">over to him and I shove my hand inside</text>
  <text start="3481.24" dur="5.04">of his body and I can feel his internal</text>
  <text start="3483.79" dur="6.21">organs and I think I&amp;#39;m looking for his</text>
  <text start="3486.28" dur="6.3">kidney and I&amp;#39;m kind of messing around</text>
  <text start="3490" dur="6.69">there for a while and I pull my hand out</text>
  <text start="3492.58" dur="6.3">in the dream ends Denise and I wake up</text>
  <text start="3496.69" dur="5.85">in the morning and I was thinking what</text>
  <text start="3498.88" dur="5.85">is this dream about at first I thought</text>
  <text start="3502.54" dur="4.38">the Lord was saying something like what</text>
  <text start="3504.73" dur="4.77">he said to Thomas you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="3506.92" dur="4.83">believe me until you put your hand in my</text>
  <text start="3509.5" dur="4.82">side that&amp;#39;s actually how I interpreted</text>
  <text start="3511.75" dur="5.37">that dream like the Lord was saying</text>
  <text start="3514.32" dur="4.27">you&amp;#39;re full of unbelief but if you put</text>
  <text start="3517.12" dur="3.81">your head in my side then you&amp;#39;ll believe</text>
  <text start="3518.59" dur="5.91">me that is how I took that dream at</text>
  <text start="3520.93" dur="6.69">first because I had forgotten about the</text>
  <text start="3524.5" dur="5.76">pastor who needed a new kidney so later</text>
  <text start="3527.62" dur="6.72">on that day I go on Facebook and this</text>
  <text start="3530.26" dur="6">friend says hey got a praise report they</text>
  <text start="3534.34" dur="8.7">tested my pastors kidney and his kidney</text>
  <text start="3536.26" dur="9.72">function is 100% normal so evidently I</text>
  <text start="3543.04" dur="6.42">did kidney surgery in a dream how that</text>
  <text start="3545.98" dur="6.78">works I don&amp;#39;t know most of you are</text>
  <text start="3549.46" dur="7.25">learning about healing learn what you</text>
  <text start="3552.76" dur="8.7">can from everybody that you can do not</text>
  <text start="3556.71" dur="9.34">narrow your focus on one person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3561.46" dur="7.4">teaching as much as these anointed men</text>
  <text start="3566.05" dur="6.51">of God and women of God have some great</text>
  <text start="3568.86" dur="6.34">testimonies as great success I guarantee</text>
  <text start="3572.56" dur="6.12">you they have things that they have not</text>
  <text start="3575.2" dur="6.96">seen healed go to somebody else and they</text>
  <text start="3578.68" dur="5.55">will have testimonies of those people</text>
  <text start="3582.16" dur="4.89">who are healed Steve Hartman is a good</text>
  <text start="3584.23" dur="3.83">example Steve&amp;#39;s a buddy of mine Facebook</text>
  <text start="3587.05" dur="2.24">friend</text>
  <text start="3588.06" dur="3.21">if you&amp;#39;re interested in really cool</text>
  <text start="3589.29" dur="5.58">stuff look him up on Facebook he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="3591.27" dur="6.39">got a page Steven I talk a lot Steve is</text>
  <text start="3594.87" dur="5.55">one of the guys who he went to Bible</text>
  <text start="3597.66" dur="4.29">College he didn&amp;#39;t want to go but the</text>
  <text start="3600.42" dur="6.57">Lord made him go</text>
  <text start="3601.95" dur="9.33">and Steve&amp;#39;s ministry is he is reaching</text>
  <text start="3606.99" dur="11.94">Christians for Jesus that is his calling</text>
  <text start="3611.28" dur="12.66">he is called to show Christians the real</text>
  <text start="3618.93" dur="8.79">Jesus that Jesus who loves people the</text>
  <text start="3623.94" dur="6.63">Jesus who wants to heal everybody the</text>
  <text start="3627.72" dur="5.85">Jesus who loves the gays love is the</text>
  <text start="3630.57" dur="6.51">drug addicts loves the homeless Steve</text>
  <text start="3633.57" dur="5.76">has a gift of the supernatural hug he</text>
  <text start="3637.08" dur="3.99">can wrap you in a hug and you will go</text>
  <text start="3639.33" dur="3.6">through emotional healing physical</text>
  <text start="3641.07" dur="4.38">healing the father will show stuff to</text>
  <text start="3642.93" dur="7.17">you when he hugs you you will experience</text>
  <text start="3645.45" dur="6.48">something very cool Steve isn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="3650.1" dur="3.75">truly outside the box kind of a guy and</text>
  <text start="3651.93" dur="6.81">I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot from him because</text>
  <text start="3653.85" dur="6.56">Steve has taken revelation and books and</text>
  <text start="3658.74" dur="4.38">training from a lot of different people</text>
  <text start="3660.41" dur="4.9">put it all together let the Lord sort it</text>
  <text start="3663.12" dur="4.77">out and then the Lord adds stuff to all</text>
  <text start="3665.31" dur="5.55">that so what happens is when people go</text>
  <text start="3667.89" dur="5.97">to all these other ministries and</text>
  <text start="3670.86" dur="5.55">everyone from David Hogan to Curie Blake</text>
  <text start="3673.86" dur="5.16">to Cal piers to Bill Johnson to all the</text>
  <text start="3676.41" dur="4.35">big-name healing ministries people go</text>
  <text start="3679.02" dur="3.9">there and they can&amp;#39;t get healed people</text>
  <text start="3680.76" dur="4.8">go to Steve they wear it Steve works in</text>
  <text start="3682.92" dur="4.14">for six months and they get healed he is</text>
  <text start="3685.56" dur="4.29">getting the worst of the worst cases</text>
  <text start="3687.06" dur="6.09">that nobody else can get healed and the</text>
  <text start="3689.85" dur="7.02">reason he&amp;#39;s having success is because he</text>
  <text start="3693.15" dur="6.15">is allowing Jesus and the Holy Spirit to</text>
  <text start="3696.87" dur="4.68">give him specific information about how</text>
  <text start="3699.3" dur="6.3">to deal with each person and he comes</text>
  <text start="3701.55" dur="6.48">with no preset agenda he&amp;#39;s like I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3705.6" dur="5.64">have a formula for this I don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="3708.03" dur="4.2">expectations I expect that Jesus is</text>
  <text start="3711.24" dur="3.57">going to show up</text>
  <text start="3712.23" dur="5.76">and many times he will physically appear</text>
  <text start="3714.81" dur="5.07">in the room with them and lead them</text>
  <text start="3717.99" dur="5.76">through the encounter to</text>
  <text start="3719.88" dur="6.689">the person yielded that&amp;#39;s kind of my</text>
  <text start="3723.75" dur="7.259">approach to healing and the miraculous</text>
  <text start="3726.569" dur="7.111">is in the last year too the Lord has</text>
  <text start="3731.009" dur="6.32">really been emphasizing for me emotional</text>
  <text start="3733.68" dur="7.22">healing we have seen people who have</text>
  <text start="3737.329" dur="5.68">severe back pain from car accidents</text>
  <text start="3740.9" dur="4.26">received a lot of Prayer can&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="3743.009" dur="4.891">healed took them through a little</text>
  <text start="3745.16" dur="6.34">emotional healing process to get healed</text>
  <text start="3747.9" dur="7.409">of emotional trauma from abuse from</text>
  <text start="3751.5" dur="7.529">husbands and fathers and mothers sexual</text>
  <text start="3755.309" dur="7.111">abuse physical abuse verbal abuse causes</text>
  <text start="3759.029" dur="5.131">emotional trauma and the enemy uses it</text>
  <text start="3762.42" dur="5.31">against this and can cause physical</text>
  <text start="3764.16" dur="6.81">symptoms of illness and pain that can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3767.73" dur="6.389">be healed through using Authority and</text>
  <text start="3770.97" dur="6">power it just doesn&amp;#39;t work you have to</text>
  <text start="3774.119" dur="5.16">heal the wounds in the soul to get those</text>
  <text start="3776.97" dur="5.97">people healed and we have seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="3779.279" dur="6.54">success with getting people in fact</text>
  <text start="3782.94" dur="4.079">nowadays if I pray for someone most of</text>
  <text start="3785.819" dur="3.121">the time I&amp;#39;m gonna take them through a</text>
  <text start="3787.019" dur="6.02">very brief short emotional healing</text>
  <text start="3788.94" dur="9.599">prayer to get them healed of rejection</text>
  <text start="3793.039" dur="8.77">shame guilt anger all those emotional</text>
  <text start="3798.539" dur="7.891">wounds because those things make your</text>
  <text start="3801.809" dur="6.931">life hell and they also allow physical</text>
  <text start="3806.43" dur="4.8">infirmities to continue made this one</text>
  <text start="3808.74" dur="4.349">woman we prayed for she had been in for</text>
  <text start="3811.23" dur="3.41">car accidents and had horrible neck and</text>
  <text start="3813.089" dur="3.45">back pain and nobody could get healed</text>
  <text start="3814.64" dur="3.82">took her through the emotional healing</text>
  <text start="3816.539" dur="3.361">process got her healed of the shame and</text>
  <text start="3818.46" dur="3.93">the anger and the guilt and the</text>
  <text start="3819.9" dur="3.959">rejection simple prayer over her back</text>
  <text start="3822.39" dur="4.409">all the pains have been completely gone</text>
  <text start="3823.859" dur="6.271">it didn&amp;#39;t come back the Lord has a lot</text>
  <text start="3826.799" dur="6.81">of tools he wants to give us but if your</text>
  <text start="3830.13" dur="5.899">only tool is a hammer everything looks</text>
  <text start="3833.609" dur="2.42">like a nail</text>
  <text start="3836.46" dur="6.07">and we tend to approach healing as I</text>
  <text start="3840.97" dur="3.33">only have a hammer</text>
  <text start="3842.53" dur="3.69">I&amp;#39;m in a hammer and hammer and hammer</text>
  <text start="3844.3" dur="3.39">and hammer I got Authority I got</text>
  <text start="3846.22" dur="3.15">authority I&amp;#39;m gonna use my authority</text>
  <text start="3847.69" dur="3.72">well sometimes Authority is not what you</text>
  <text start="3849.37" dur="7.29">need to work with sometimes there&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="3851.41" dur="6.42">angel standing next to you saying and</text>

  <text start="3862.12" dur="5.79">you&amp;#39;re not listening the Lord has a lot</text>
  <text start="3866.02" dur="5.34">of different ways we can get people</text>
  <text start="3867.91" dur="6.39">healed and set free the toolbox is</text>
  <text start="3871.36" dur="4.95">enormous it&amp;#39;s like a shop full of all</text>
  <text start="3874.3" dur="4.65">different kinds of tools and many of us</text>

  <text start="3890.05" dur="7.35">us all the tools in the shop and every</text>
  <text start="3893.64" dur="5.86">tool has a specific purpose in a way he</text>
  <text start="3897.4" dur="5.16">wants us to use it so we need to be</text>
  <text start="3899.5" dur="5.4">trained just like a carpenter you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3902.56" dur="4.35">use a bandsaw for every woodworking</text>
  <text start="3904.9" dur="3.66">project sometimes you need a table saw</text>

  <text start="3912.46" dur="4.05">purposes Healing is the same way there</text>
  <text start="3915.58" dur="3.75">are a lot of different things that we</text>
  <text start="3916.51" dur="7.17">can use to get people healed but we have</text>
  <text start="3919.33" dur="7.47">to resist the temptation to put God in</text>
  <text start="3923.68" dur="4.44">the little box it is a very big box in</text>
