  <text start="143.65" dur="3.99">of discussion about the big secret we</text>
  <text start="145.629" dur="4.901">were keeping all summer long about your</text>

  <text start="152.15" dur="4.05">that yeah sure yeah</text>
  <text start="154.58" dur="3.57">man it&amp;#39;s been it&amp;#39;s been quite the</text>
  <text start="156.2" dur="4.59">interesting journey and it all kind of</text>
  <text start="158.15" dur="4.29">just happened from the vision that</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="6.09">Johnny Clarke had for the documentary</text>
  <text start="162.44" dur="9.69">called dead razor and so that premiered</text>
  <text start="166.88" dur="8.22">in 2014 and in this I&amp;#39;m sorry 2013 and</text>
  <text start="172.13" dur="4.62">in the summer of 2014 a production</text>
  <text start="175.1" dur="3.72">company called screaming flee out of</text>
  <text start="176.75" dur="3.84">Seattle they loved the documentary to</text>
  <text start="178.82" dur="3.51">love the the people in it they love the</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="3.119">story they love the vision and so they</text>
  <text start="182.33" dur="4.35">wanted to turn it into a reality show</text>
  <text start="183.709" dur="4.351">and I remember when that kind of came</text>
  <text start="186.68" dur="3.21">across Carrie and I just kind of looked</text>
  <text start="188.06" dur="3">at each other and said is this really</text>
  <text start="189.89" dur="2.91">something that we want to be a part of</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="4.05">because you know we were we were nervous</text>
  <text start="192.8" dur="3">and and we didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect we</text>
  <text start="195.11" dur="2.61">didn&amp;#39;t know what we were getting</text>
  <text start="195.8" dur="3.93">ourselves into but we just spent a lot</text>
  <text start="197.72" dur="3.12">of time just talking to the Lord just</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="3.3">spending a lot of time in prayer and</text>
  <text start="200.84" dur="4.02">just trying to discern the best way to</text>
  <text start="203.03" dur="3.57">move forward and we just felt like God</text>
  <text start="204.86" dur="4.05">was saying go ahead and walk through</text>
  <text start="206.6" dur="5.06">this door that&amp;#39;s open and so we said yes</text>
  <text start="208.91" dur="5.85">and in March of 2015 March of this year</text>
  <text start="211.66" dur="6.19">we began production for a new series</text>
  <text start="214.76" dur="5.789">called project afterlife and the series</text>
  <text start="217.85" dur="4.62">is based on three criteria for people</text>
  <text start="220.549" dur="4.201">they had to have been clinically dead</text>
  <text start="222.47" dur="4.829">they had to have an other side</text>
  <text start="224.75" dur="4.98">experience and they had to have somebody</text>
  <text start="227.299" dur="5.881">praying for them to come back to life</text>
  <text start="229.73" dur="5.28">and so man it&amp;#39;s been so exciting getting</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="4.47">to uncover the details of these</text>
  <text start="235.01" dur="4.17">different cases and and I mean some</text>
  <text start="237.65" dur="3.119">details have blown my mind is blown</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="3.899">other people&amp;#39;s minds but it&amp;#39;s just all</text>
  <text start="240.769" dur="3.78">so good and and I&amp;#39;ve just been loving</text>
  <text start="243.079" dur="3.72">every part of it it&amp;#39;s been a new</text>
  <text start="244.549" dur="4.051">discovery every time I go out yeah I</text>
  <text start="246.799" dur="3.901">love the show too I&amp;#39;ve been a big</text>
  <text start="248.6" dur="5.52">follower of near-death experiences and</text>
  <text start="250.7" dur="5.4">resurrection testimonies on my blog I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="254.12" dur="3.869">probably posted well over 30 or 35</text>
  <text start="256.1" dur="4.109">resurrection testimonies over the years</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="4.831">because I just find the story so</text>
  <text start="260.209" dur="5.011">fascinating it&amp;#39;s so compelling and you</text>
  <text start="262.82" dur="3.45">know it does blow your mind because you</text>
  <text start="265.22" dur="3.69">know you and I were talking earlier</text>
  <text start="266.27" dur="5.12">today if you want to investigate the</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="5.069">afterlife and afterlife experiences</text>
  <text start="271.39" dur="4.27">honestly and objectively you kind of</text>
  <text start="273.979" dur="3.721">have to put some of your preconceptions</text>
  <text start="275.66" dur="3.42">on hold because what you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="4.11">find out is going to blow your</text>
  <text start="279.08" dur="4.11">preconceptions out of the water</text>
  <text start="281.81" dur="3.12">I mean it&amp;#39;s happened to me you know</text>
  <text start="283.19" dur="4.5">going to talking to these people I grew</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="4.35">up in a traditional belief of what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="4.35">supposed to happen when we die and we go</text>
  <text start="289.28" dur="5.25">to heaven and all that and and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="292.04" dur="4.89">you know you know every single case that</text>
  <text start="294.53" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re uncovering the details are they</text>
  <text start="296.93" dur="2.64">may be a little dark in the beginning</text>
  <text start="298.1" dur="2.97">and then they change to I mean Jesus</text>
  <text start="299.57" dur="3.84">comes in and pours in his light or they</text>
  <text start="301.07" dur="3.78">may just be nothing but joy in the</text>
  <text start="303.41" dur="3.78">beginning as we enter into the presence</text>
  <text start="304.85" dur="3.63">of Christ but different details that</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ve uncovered have stretched my own</text>
  <text start="308.48" dur="4.86">understanding and I don&amp;#39;t know that I</text>
  <text start="310.67" dur="5.22">expected to be impacted or changed this</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="3.63">much by being a part of this show I mean</text>
  <text start="315.89" dur="2.61">there&amp;#39;s just things in that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="316.97" dur="4.44">stretched my heart stretched my faith</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="5.52">stretch my understanding and that is</text>
  <text start="321.41" dur="4.77">really uncomfortable for people and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.02" dur="3.54">possible for me too I mean we have to</text>
  <text start="326.18" dur="3.42">wrestle with this stuff and I&amp;#39;ve had to</text>
  <text start="327.56" dur="3.69">wrestle with some things that people</text>
  <text start="329.6" dur="2.94">have said they&amp;#39;ve experienced and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="331.25" dur="3.33">just kind of had to say well I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="332.54" dur="3.45">gonna not gonna pick and choose what</text>
  <text start="334.58" dur="3.57">parts of their experience I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="335.99" dur="4.92">believe and then call them liars on the</text>
  <text start="338.15" dur="4.68">other part I got a I got a take in the</text>
  <text start="340.91" dur="3.66">whole experience and wrestle with it and</text>
  <text start="342.83" dur="3.36">just take it to God and say you know</text>
  <text start="344.57" dur="2.61">what do you what do you want me to learn</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="2.22">through this and what do you want show</text>
  <text start="347.18" dur="3.33">me through this it&amp;#39;s just been really</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="4.05">fascinating yeah I think one of the</text>
  <text start="350.51" dur="3.27">things that a lot of people find</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="4.2">uncomfortable about talking about</text>
  <text start="353.78" dur="6.93">afterlife experiences is like you said</text>
  <text start="356.66" dur="5.64">we tend to have this neat tidy theology</text>
  <text start="360.71" dur="3.18">and eschatology and all of our little</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="3.63">ducks in a row and we think we</text>
  <text start="363.89" dur="3.84">understand how it all works and you know</text>
  <text start="365.93" dur="2.88">if you&amp;#39;re believer and you die you go</text>
  <text start="367.73" dur="3.99">right to heaven and nothing in between</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="5.73">but the problem is I I&amp;#39;ve interviewed</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="5.1">well over you know probably 75 maybe a</text>
  <text start="374.54" dur="5.79">hundred people over the years in the</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="5.34">ambulance in my job who have had cardiac</text>
  <text start="380.33" dur="5.16">arrest and have had afterlife</text>
  <text start="382.16" dur="6.18">experiences and the stories that I hear</text>
  <text start="385.49" dur="5.04">I&amp;#39;m just like wow that is crazy the</text>
  <text start="388.34" dur="4.68">things that people experience and see</text>
  <text start="390.53" dur="3.75">and do and the places they go and you</text>
  <text start="393.02" dur="3.06">know the interesting thing is a lot of</text>
  <text start="394.28" dur="4.47">people do not go right to heaven</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="5.73">immediately when they die in fact the</text>
  <text start="398.75" dur="6.84">first six stories you guys did four of</text>
  <text start="401.81" dur="6.12">them were not believers all right and so</text>
  <text start="405.59" dur="3.96">you know they didn&amp;#39;t go right to heaven</text>
  <text start="407.93" dur="2.22">immediately they had some other stuff</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="2.37">going on</text>
  <text start="410.15" dur="4.47">one of the interesting things I find a</text>
  <text start="411.92" dur="4.74">lot is when people go into cardiac</text>
  <text start="414.62" dur="3.74">arrest</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="5.13">they either remain in the room</text>
  <text start="418.36" dur="6.1">relatively you know for about a minute</text>
  <text start="421.79" dur="4.11">or two and then they start kind of</text>
  <text start="424.46" dur="2.91">wandering around the earth plane they</text>
  <text start="425.9" dur="4.29">start going to different places visiting</text>
  <text start="427.37" dur="5.15">people and going to hospitals and they</text>
  <text start="430.19" dur="4.65">just start kind of wandering around and</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="3.82">sometimes they go down into the</text>
  <text start="434.84" dur="4.65">underworld sometimes they go into heaven</text>
  <text start="436.34" dur="6.18">after a little while but it&amp;#39;s really to</text>
  <text start="439.49" dur="5.61">me it&amp;#39;s really fascinating oh go ahead</text>
  <text start="442.52" dur="5.01">we had we had two cases in particular</text>
  <text start="445.1" dur="4.77">and in the second episode we had Rick</text>
  <text start="447.53" dur="3.69">Madison who it had his out-of-body</text>
  <text start="449.87" dur="3.84">experience and he started walking</text>
  <text start="451.22" dur="5.07">through the hospital and a chapel and</text>
  <text start="453.71" dur="3.72">saw his mother praying and then he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="456.29" dur="2.19">like you were talking about people</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="2.82">coming out of their bodies and walking</text>
  <text start="458.48" dur="3.81">around he experienced that and then we</text>
  <text start="460.25" dur="5.31">had Arthur veal in the third episode</text>
  <text start="462.29" dur="6.21">went to what we can only assume is she</text>
  <text start="465.56" dur="5.28">all at this point right you have these</text>
  <text start="468.5" dur="3.78">different experiences and you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="470.84" dur="3.42">like I said we&amp;#39;re left to wrestle with</text>
  <text start="472.28" dur="4.44">with some of that and just to try to</text>
  <text start="474.26" dur="5.37">wrap our minds around it you know yeah I</text>
  <text start="476.72" dur="5.4">liked the first episode and the third</text>
  <text start="479.63" dur="5.61">episode but the second episode really</text>
  <text start="482.12" dur="5.7">hooked me Denise was crying throughout</text>
  <text start="485.24" dur="3.96">the entire show most of it began and I</text>
  <text start="487.82" dur="3.45">know part of the reason why she was</text>
  <text start="489.2" dur="4.53">crying was she was really envisioning</text>
  <text start="491.27" dur="5.25">what would happen to me if I ever went</text>
  <text start="493.73" dur="4.89">into cardiac arrest and I died would she</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="4.71">have the faith to pray to bring me back</text>
  <text start="498.62" dur="4.02">from death and she was wrestling with a</text>
  <text start="501.23" dur="3.48">lot of these issues and we talked about</text>
  <text start="502.64" dur="4.79">it afterwards it really impacted her in</text>
  <text start="504.71" dur="5.85">a big way it is on destination America</text>

  <text start="592.889" dur="3.75">books I wrote were nonfiction so we we</text>
  <text start="595.11" dur="5.669">published a marriage what&amp;#39;s the point in</text>
  <text start="596.639" dur="5.961">2010 life resurrected came in 2012 and</text>
  <text start="600.779" dur="4.8">that actually has a handful of</text>
  <text start="602.6" dur="5.71">Resurrection testimonies in it that I</text>
  <text start="605.579" dur="5.88">would I had the chance to see and play a</text>
  <text start="608.31" dur="5.16">role in and then and then I was spending</text>
  <text start="611.459" dur="3.24">some time with the Lord one morning and</text>
  <text start="613.47" dur="3.63">I was just kind of sit in my chair just</text>
  <text start="614.699" dur="5.311">like hey god what&amp;#39;s going on and and he</text>
  <text start="617.1" dur="5.13">just began to download into my heart and</text>
  <text start="620.01" dur="4.639">just began to explain to me that the the</text>
  <text start="622.23" dur="4.469">problem for the vast majority of people</text>
  <text start="624.649" dur="4.06">regarding a relationship with him and</text>
  <text start="626.699" dur="5.161">just inner healing and freedom isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="628.709" dur="5.101">that isn&amp;#39;t our ability to to love him</text>
  <text start="631.86" dur="4.95">you know I feel like he was saying that</text>
  <text start="633.81" dur="5.16">he believes that we love him as much as</text>
  <text start="636.81" dur="3.389">we can it&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re saying God we</text>
  <text start="638.97" dur="4.71">love you he&amp;#39;s saying no you&amp;#39;re a liar</text>
  <text start="640.199" dur="8.101">the issue is in our ability to truly</text>
  <text start="643.68" dur="6.899">believe that he loves us back yeah the</text>
  <text start="648.3" dur="4.2">ability for us to rest in his love and</text>
  <text start="650.579" dur="4.38">to truly see ourselves the way that he</text>
  <text start="652.5" dur="3.75">sees us and so I just kind of let that</text>
  <text start="654.959" dur="3.421">simmer for a while it seemed like it was</text>
  <text start="656.25" dur="4.889">so much of a bigger thing than than a</text>
  <text start="658.38" dur="3.87">blog post or or something like that I</text>
  <text start="661.139" dur="2.491">said Lord what do you want me to do do</text>
  <text start="662.25" dur="3.779">you want me to write another non-fiction</text>
  <text start="663.63" dur="4.53">book and you said no so what do you want</text>
  <text start="666.029" dur="5.971">me to do and he said I want you to tell</text>
  <text start="668.16" dur="6.78">that through a story and I said god I</text>
  <text start="672" dur="4.709">don&amp;#39;t know how to write fiction and he</text>
  <text start="674.94" dur="3.42">said is it that&amp;#39;s okay we&amp;#39;ll walk</text>
  <text start="676.709" dur="6.031">through it and I&amp;#39;ll teach you how so</text>
  <text start="678.36" dur="6.18">three years later very long I mean the</text>
  <text start="682.74" dur="3.93">journey to to writing this book has been</text>
  <text start="684.54" dur="3.87">really eye-opening and it&amp;#39;s been really</text>
  <text start="686.67" dur="3.87">amazing I&amp;#39;ve had a great time doing it</text>
  <text start="688.41" dur="3.869">I&amp;#39;ve found that I love telling stories</text>
  <text start="690.54" dur="3.959">which is something I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if I</text>
  <text start="692.279" dur="3.45">could do or not and so</text>
  <text start="694.499" dur="3.21">learning all the technical skills</text>
  <text start="695.729" dur="5.55">writing it but it&amp;#39;s called finding home</text>
  <text start="697.709" dur="6.17">and in it we have John who is really</text>
  <text start="701.279" dur="6.15">kind of a pillar in in his town and</text>
  <text start="703.879" dur="5.74">experiences just a horrific tragedy in</text>
  <text start="707.429" dur="4.8">his life and the circumstances of that</text>
  <text start="709.619" dur="5.19">just just make him turn all the blame</text>
  <text start="712.229" dur="5.19">onto God and so he walks away he moves</text>
  <text start="714.809" dur="3.69">out of town you know it takes it leaves</text>
  <text start="717.419" dur="3.48">everything behind that he could be</text>
  <text start="718.499" dur="6">recognized by and sets out the life that</text>
  <text start="720.899" dur="5.37">is really just in booze and and women</text>
  <text start="724.499" dur="4.86">and gambling and just a real dark time</text>
  <text start="726.269" dur="4.44">in his life and so he wants to stay that</text>
  <text start="729.359" dur="3">way and he&amp;#39;s staying that way until he</text>
  <text start="730.709" dur="3.84">meets a mystical stranger who because I</text>
  <text start="732.359" dur="4.29">challenge him on that and he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="734.549" dur="4.29">really find - can&amp;#39;t really stay in that</text>
  <text start="736.649" dur="4.11">state anymore because of the challenge</text>
  <text start="738.839" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s being provided for him and then</text>
  <text start="740.759" dur="6.6">on the other side we have a young woman</text>
  <text start="743.099" dur="7.02">named Alice and she has just come off of</text>
  <text start="747.359" dur="5.94">the streets of life of prostitution and</text>
  <text start="750.119" dur="7.02">the sex trade and she has found a home</text>
  <text start="753.299" dur="5.73">for to speak in Redwood New York and so</text>
  <text start="757.139" dur="4.65">she found a family there and so her</text>
  <text start="759.029" dur="4.59">journey is discovering even more of who</text>
  <text start="761.789" dur="3.87">she is in the Lord and coming free from</text>
  <text start="763.619" dur="3.87">from a life that entangled her and the</text>
  <text start="765.659" dur="4.95">bond is that entangled her and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="767.489" dur="5.09">beautiful out then these two stories are</text>
  <text start="770.609" dur="4.5">just weaved together and just the the</text>
  <text start="772.579" dur="4.9">redemption of God and the restoration of</text>
  <text start="775.109" dur="5.01">God and and I just had an awesome time</text>
  <text start="777.479" dur="4.65">writing it and I think it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="780.119" dur="4.29">powerful and the story and just the way</text>
  <text start="782.129" dur="3.87">that that God moves in it and so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="784.409" dur="4.2">really excited for it I&amp;#39;m really I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="785.999" dur="4.89">happy about it so well you&amp;#39;ve learned a</text>
  <text start="788.609" dur="4.77">lot about the writing process in doing</text>
  <text start="790.889" dur="4.26">this book I mean I was privy to the kind</text>
  <text start="793.379" dur="4.11">of the inside of it because you and I</text>
  <text start="795.149" dur="3.72">use the same editor and so Lydia was</text>
  <text start="797.489" dur="2.88">talking to me about what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="798.869" dur="2.97">you and she&amp;#39;s editing your book while</text>
  <text start="800.369" dur="3.78">she&amp;#39;s editing one of my books and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="801.839" dur="4.2">talking and we you and I are boxing each</text>
  <text start="804.149" dur="4.23">other and stuff and you were generous</text>
  <text start="806.039" dur="4.14">enough to let me have a beta copy of the</text>
  <text start="808.379" dur="5.4">book so I read it before it published</text>
  <text start="810.179" dur="7.74">and I&amp;#39;ll tell you you said it perfectly</text>
  <text start="813.779" dur="7.5">the way that these two lives are played</text>
  <text start="817.919" dur="6.48">out and the way that God redeems their</text>
  <text start="821.279" dur="6.21">past and gives them a fresh perspective</text>
  <text start="824.399" dur="3.631">on life and hidden in his love and who</text>
  <text start="827.489" dur="2.491">they are</text>
  <text start="828.03" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s just really powerful I just love</text>

  <text start="865.83" dur="5.64">eyebrows scrunching shoulder shrugging</text>
  <text start="868.53" dur="4.38">well and you know the thing is like I</text>
  <text start="871.47" dur="4.04">said you learned a lot in the process of</text>
  <text start="872.91" dur="5.13">writing this book and yeah yeah you know</text>
  <text start="875.51" dur="5.71">we all learn in the process of writing</text>

  <text start="894.24" dur="4.11">gonna be writing some fiction books as</text>
  <text start="895.65" dur="4.74">well but yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna write an e-book</text>
  <text start="898.35" dur="4.44">and I have to get this thing off my</text>
  <text start="900.39" dur="4.199">plate because about four months ago the</text>
  <text start="902.79" dur="4.89">Lord gave me this dream he gave me an</text>
  <text start="904.589" dur="6.661">entire story in a dream and I could read</text>
  <text start="907.68" dur="5.04">the text of the dream or the text of the</text>
  <text start="911.25" dur="3.63">story it was something like about a five</text>
  <text start="912.72" dur="5.34">thousand word essay it was just a story</text>
  <text start="914.88" dur="5.76">about the goodness of God and it was the</text>
  <text start="918.06" dur="4.92">craziest dream because the Lord was just</text>
  <text start="920.64" dur="4.74">telling me this story and I could read</text>
  <text start="922.98" dur="4.859">all the words and when I woke up I was</text>
  <text start="925.38" dur="5.43">like how do I remember like a five</text>
  <text start="927.839" dur="6.121">thousand word story which was just a</text>
  <text start="930.81" dur="5.61">spiritual image that I saw it was crazy</text>
  <text start="933.96" dur="4.62">I don&amp;#39;t actually remember the entire</text>
  <text start="936.42" dur="4.2">story but I remember the concepts of the</text>
  <text start="938.58" dur="3.27">story so I think what the Lord is</text>
  <text start="940.62" dur="4.02">telling me is he wants me to write a</text>
  <text start="941.85" dur="5.58">story that displays the goodness of God</text>

  <text start="1759.279" dur="4.95">things I mean we&amp;#39;re both praying for</text>
  <text start="1761.32" dur="5.279">people on the job I read a live your</text>
  <text start="1764.229" dur="4.471">stories on your website and it seems to</text>
  <text start="1766.599" dur="4.08">me like God uses you more in the</text>
  <text start="1768.7" dur="4.679">prophetic more so than he does in</text>
  <text start="1770.679" dur="4.86">healing because you seem to be always</text>
  <text start="1773.379" dur="4.02">writing stories where God is giving you</text>
  <text start="1775.539" dur="4.74">like encouraging words for people and</text>
  <text start="1777.399" dur="5.99">for me it&amp;#39;s a lot of oh wow that you got</text>
  <text start="1780.279" dur="3.11">back pain here let&amp;#39;s get that healed</text>
  <text start="1783.57" dur="5.019">yeah you know the prophetic is really</text>
  <text start="1786.489" dur="4.5">weird you know I grew up the first gift</text>
  <text start="1788.589" dur="4.08">that I did I asked to receive was the</text>
  <text start="1790.989" dur="4.11">gift of the prophetic I just felt</text>
  <text start="1792.669" dur="4.501">something stir in response to that and</text>
  <text start="1795.099" dur="4.801">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of where my my comfort</text>
  <text start="1797.17" dur="4.65">and and to be able to pray for somebody</text>
  <text start="1799.9" dur="4.35">to be healed or raise from the bed is is</text>
  <text start="1801.82" dur="4.29">more of a step outside of my comfort</text>
  <text start="1804.25" dur="3.83">zone as far as a spiritual gifts go I</text>
  <text start="1806.11" dur="4.65">mean those are things like the prophetic</text>
  <text start="1808.08" dur="4">is the ease comes to me the easiest but</text>
  <text start="1810.76" dur="2.37">praying for somebody to be healed or</text>
  <text start="1812.08" dur="2.82">praying for somebody that can be raised</text>
  <text start="1813.13" dur="4.2">from the dead is something that takes</text>
  <text start="1814.9" dur="4.74">more of an effort for me to do that</text>
  <text start="1817.33" dur="3.75">makes sense at all I mean that is so</text>
  <text start="1819.64" dur="2.88">interesting too because you know we all</text>
  <text start="1821.08" dur="3.72">have our different comfort zone I mean</text>
  <text start="1822.52" dur="3.93">if you are you know a believer and you</text>
  <text start="1824.8" dur="4.47">understand the gifts of the Spirit I</text>
  <text start="1826.45" dur="4.35">think everybody has a particular gift</text>
  <text start="1829.27" dur="4.17">that they feel really comfortable with</text>
  <text start="1830.8" dur="4.5">like for me it&amp;#39;s healing you know God</text>
  <text start="1833.44" dur="3.87">has spoken to me more about healing and</text>
  <text start="1835.3" dur="4.53">has demonstrated healing through me more</text>
  <text start="1837.31" dur="6.33">than anything else for me prophecy is a</text>
  <text start="1839.83" dur="7.35">stretch I don&amp;#39;t very often give people</text>
  <text start="1843.64" dur="5.1">prophetic words I would get like people</text>
  <text start="1847.18" dur="3.63">asking me on social media hey can you</text>
  <text start="1848.74" dur="3.54">give me a word and I&amp;#39;m like you probably</text>
  <text start="1850.81" dur="5.97">got the wrong guy you want to go talk to</text>
  <text start="1852.28" dur="6.6">Jesse or somebody else but I have just</text>
  <text start="1856.78" dur="4.02">tons of faith for healing you know like</text>
  <text start="1858.88" dur="4.23">I will just go after anything that has</text>
  <text start="1860.8" dur="3.48">to do with healing and and I mean I will</text>
  <text start="1863.11" dur="3.9">give prophetic words and I&amp;#39;ve given</text>
  <text start="1864.28" dur="4.92">people some you know some messages from</text>
  <text start="1867.01" dur="3.81">God but it is interesting that everybody</text>
  <text start="1869.2" dur="5.61">seems to have a little different comfort</text>
  <text start="1870.82" dur="5.79">zone with regard to spiritual gifts yeah</text>
  <text start="1874.81" dur="3.93">you know it just seems like when when</text>
  <text start="1876.61" dur="5.88">the Lord leaves me in front of somebody</text>
  <text start="1878.74" dur="5.4">he just he reveals their their hog it -</text>
  <text start="1882.49" dur="4.2">I get to catch a glimpse of their heart</text>
  <text start="1884.14" dur="4.62">and maybe not even the the heart that</text>
  <text start="1886.69" dur="4.65">they are wearing on the outside but</text>
  <text start="1888.76" dur="4.83">what&amp;#39;s deeper on the inside there was a</text>
  <text start="1891.34" dur="4.32">gentleman that we transported we ended</text>
  <text start="1893.59" dur="4.02">up putting him out in triage and he was</text>
  <text start="1895.66" dur="4.8">suffering from a few debilitating</text>
  <text start="1897.61" dur="4.65">illnesses and just a heaviness that I</text>
  <text start="1900.46" dur="3">saw on his shoulders just that the Lord</text>
  <text start="1902.26" dur="3.36">allowed me to sing on his shoulders I</text>
  <text start="1903.46" dur="3.96">was pushing him down it was almost as if</text>
  <text start="1905.62" dur="4.59">he it wasn&amp;#39;t even impossible for him to</text>
  <text start="1907.42" dur="5.55">sit up straight and so I just waited</text>
  <text start="1910.21" dur="4.23">told my partner had left and was putting</text>
  <text start="1912.97" dur="3.51">the stretcher back together and the</text>
  <text start="1914.44" dur="3.99">nurse the triage nurse had gone on to do</text>
  <text start="1916.48" dur="4.29">her thing and I just sat next to him in</text>
  <text start="1918.43" dur="4.47">and I just asked him if he would be okay</text>
  <text start="1920.77" dur="3.3">if I prayed for him and he just looked</text>
  <text start="1922.9" dur="4.56">at me with hope and he said yes</text>
  <text start="1924.07" dur="5.04">absolutely and and I just asked the Holy</text>
  <text start="1927.46" dur="2.79">Spirit&amp;#39;s begin to speak to me and and I</text>
  <text start="1929.11" dur="4.11">saw these</text>
  <text start="1930.25" dur="5.64">these banners come across his forehead</text>
  <text start="1933.22" dur="4.77">and on each one of the banners was where</text>
  <text start="1935.89" dur="5.52">they were written things like worthless</text>
  <text start="1937.99" dur="5.22">and unlovable and failure and all of</text>
  <text start="1941.41" dur="3.18">these different horrible accusations</text>
  <text start="1943.21" dur="2.73">that had been brought against him his</text>
  <text start="1944.59" dur="3.84">entire life the things that the enemy</text>
  <text start="1945.94" dur="5.91">had written on the the tablets of his</text>
  <text start="1948.43" dur="5.97">heart that had become his identity and</text>
  <text start="1951.85" dur="5.7">the Lord just showed me he said I want</text>
  <text start="1954.4" dur="4.74">you to remove all of those negative</text>
  <text start="1957.55" dur="3.09">banners that have it spoken over his</text>
  <text start="1959.14" dur="3.45">life and I want you to put new ones on</text>
  <text start="1960.64" dur="3.39">there and so I just I prayed that out</text>

  <text start="1964.03" dur="3.45">know what this is what I see you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1966.07" dur="2.4">like a veil that&amp;#39;s covering your face I</text>
  <text start="1967.48" dur="2.43">mean there&amp;#39;s like banners across</text>
  <text start="1968.47" dur="3.87">beforehand I always want to rip those</text>
  <text start="1969.91" dur="4.83">off right now you are I&amp;#39;m ripping off</text>
  <text start="1972.34" dur="4.74">the the title of unlovable I&amp;#39;m ripping</text>
  <text start="1974.74" dur="4.25">off the title of insignificance and not</text>
  <text start="1977.08" dur="5.19">valuable and not loved and and</text>
  <text start="1978.99" dur="5.47">unaccepted and rejected and abandoned</text>
  <text start="1982.27" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;m ripping all those things off and in</text>
  <text start="1984.46" dur="6.09">the name of Jesus I just I just redefine</text>

  <text start="1994.45" dur="4.68">came to me to you to my heart in that</text>
  <text start="1996.58" dur="4.98">moment and his countenance began to lift</text>
  <text start="1999.13" dur="5.01">up and it&amp;#39;s you know like he&amp;#39;d never</text>
  <text start="2001.56" dur="4.53">heard those things before about him and</text>
  <text start="2004.14" dur="3.63">that the hope that that was actually for</text>
  <text start="2006.09" dur="3.6">him that that somebody could be saying</text>
  <text start="2007.77" dur="3.78">those things to him someday was reaching</text>
  <text start="2009.69" dur="3.93">out and grasping onto those words and</text>
  <text start="2011.55" dur="4.17">and was he was being drawn into the</text>
  <text start="2013.62" dur="4.95">embrace of of the loving arms of Jesus</text>
  <text start="2015.72" dur="4.71">in that moment and I mean see it in his</text>

  <text start="2100.2" dur="5.43">have a question for you hypothetical</text>
  <text start="2102.3" dur="5.96">question you have a magic wand that can</text>
  <text start="2105.63" dur="5.61">magically erase any teaching about God</text>
  <text start="2108.26" dur="7.3">what is the one teaching about God that</text>
  <text start="2111.24" dur="7.29">you would get rid of that everything man</text>
  <text start="2115.56" dur="5.25">that came quick that was knows fast</text>
  <text start="2118.53" dur="5.04">yeah that was really bad so God is in</text>
  <text start="2120.81" dur="5.31">control the one thing I would get rid of</text>
  <text start="2123.57" dur="3.6">is is that God is in ultimate control of</text>
  <text start="2126.12" dur="2.58">everything that happens on the earth</text>
  <text start="2127.17" dur="4.23">because that means that you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2128.7" dur="4.8">responsible for the evil terrible</text>
  <text start="2131.4" dur="5.19">disgusting things that happen and so</text>
  <text start="2133.5" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s the one I&amp;#39;ve removed I would not</text>
  <text start="2136.59" dur="4.98">disagree with you I think I have seen</text>
  <text start="2138.63" dur="5.31">more people&amp;#39;s faith shipwrecked and more</text>
  <text start="2141.57" dur="5.22">people&amp;#39;s lives ruined simply by the</text>
  <text start="2143.94" dur="5.82">belief that God is ultimately in control</text>
  <text start="2146.79" dur="5.01">of everything and that everything that</text>
  <text start="2149.76" dur="4.92">happens is his will because then you&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="2160.83" dur="3.96">your brain all day long trying to figure</text>
  <text start="2162.27" dur="5.4">out why would he want it this way yeah</text>
  <text start="2164.79" dur="4.77">you know and Jesus came - you know I I</text>
  <text start="2167.67" dur="4.05">believe that Jesus came to undo that</text>
  <text start="2169.56" dur="4.53">image of God Jesus came to destroy the</text>
  <text start="2171.72" dur="5.25">works of the devil the biggest some of</text>

  <text start="2183.15" dur="4.67">cross God would rather die than kill God</text>
  <text start="2186.39" dur="3.51">would rather healed and cause any</text>
  <text start="2187.82" dur="4.39">disease or anything like that you know</text>
  <text start="2189.9" dur="3.99">God is not the author of pain he&amp;#39;s loved</text>

  <text start="2199.33" dur="3.51">okay well thank you for answering that</text>
  <text start="2201.74" dur="3.8">question</text>
  <text start="2202.84" dur="5.86">because yeah I agree with you totally</text>
  <text start="2205.54" dur="4.03">you know if God is in control man does</text>

  <text start="2213.77" dur="5.79">to do and you know the the the theology</text>
  <text start="2217.52" dur="4.38">the teaching that God is ultimately in</text>
  <text start="2219.56" dur="3.99">control of everything really is much</text>
  <text start="2221.9" dur="6.78">more dangerous than people realize I</text>
  <text start="2223.55" dur="6.69">think yeah yeah I think that a lot of</text>
  <text start="2228.68" dur="5.04">conversations that I have with people</text>
