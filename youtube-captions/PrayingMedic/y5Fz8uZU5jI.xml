  <text start="27.5" dur="6.269">generals and you listen to the news</text>

  <text start="40.58" dur="5.61">options are ugly where you know no</text>
  <text start="43.489" dur="4.681">matter what we do whether we do a</text>
  <text start="46.19" dur="5.13">preemptive strike not a good option</text>
  <text start="48.17" dur="5.309">whether we let Kim jong-un continue to</text>
  <text start="51.32" dur="4.169">build up this nuclear arsenal not a good</text>
  <text start="53.479" dur="4.741">option if we do this not a good option</text>
  <text start="55.489" dur="4.681">if we do that it&amp;#39;s a bad option like one</text>
  <text start="58.22" dur="3.42">of the I think he&amp;#39;s the commander of the</text>
  <text start="60.17" dur="2.879">Joint Chiefs literally said all of our</text>
  <text start="61.64" dur="5.94">options are crappy right now we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="63.049" dur="7.291">have any good options so if you listen</text>

  <text start="76.1" dur="5.31">going to be good all right most of you</text>
  <text start="78.799" dur="6.391">know that the reason we follow Adam</text>
  <text start="81.41" dur="7.08">Gingrich on periscope is because he has</text>
  <text start="85.19" dur="6.32">good sources inside Washington he can</text>
  <text start="88.49" dur="6.18">give us information that is reliable</text>
  <text start="91.51" dur="6.88">that can kind of calm our nerves and put</text>
  <text start="94.67" dur="6.38">us at ease so gives good sources on the</text>
  <text start="98.39" dur="6.06">political spectrum all right</text>
  <text start="101.05" dur="4.81">there are other perspectives there are</text>
  <text start="104.45" dur="6.24">other perspectives we need to look at</text>
  <text start="105.86" dur="9.72">and one of them is the perfect</text>
  <text start="110.69" dur="10.02">perspective what is god saying about all</text>
  <text start="115.58" dur="7.579">of this I happen to be connected to a</text>
  <text start="120.71" dur="6.57">lot of people who are very prophetic</text>
  <text start="123.159" dur="7.511">they have visions they have angelic</text>
  <text start="127.28" dur="4.98">encounters they have perfect dreams</text>
  <text start="130.67" dur="3.179">about what&amp;#39;s going to happen I have some</text>
  <text start="132.26" dur="4.68">of them and I&amp;#39;ve connected to a lot of</text>
  <text start="133.849" dur="6.631">people who have good insight into what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="136.94" dur="6.21">going on spiritually so I have been</text>
  <text start="140.48" dur="5.339">asking my sources people that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="143.15" dur="5.309">connected to if they have been having</text>
  <text start="145.819" dur="3.221">dreams or visions or angelic encounters</text>
  <text start="148.459" dur="4.12">or anything</text>
  <text start="149.04" dur="5.839">that concern North Korea and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="152.579" dur="4.53">interesting what I&amp;#39;ve been finding out I</text>
  <text start="154.879" dur="4.661">have been I&amp;#39;ve had my ear to the ground</text>
  <text start="157.109" dur="5.19">now for a few months on this North Korea</text>
  <text start="159.54" dur="4.86">thing and I&amp;#39;m telling you I&amp;#39;ve looked</text>
  <text start="162.299" dur="4.05">back at the experiences and the</text>
  <text start="164.4" dur="6.6">revelation people have had over the last</text>
  <text start="166.349" dur="8.331">five years I can&amp;#39;t see anything negative</text>
  <text start="171" dur="6.12">that has to do with North Korea</text>
  <text start="174.68" dur="5.339">everything that I have seen and heard</text>
  <text start="177.12" dur="5.339">and I mean everything all of the sources</text>
  <text start="180.019" dur="6.22">well-respected trusted people some</text>
  <text start="182.459" dur="6.36">unknown people have all said a God is</text>
  <text start="186.239" dur="7.17">going to do something really really cool</text>
  <text start="188.819" dur="8.25">in North Korea some of the people have</text>
  <text start="193.409" dur="6.091">heard that God is going to unite North</text>
  <text start="197.069" dur="4.741">and South Korea that that is his plan</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="5.37">and that he is going to bring North</text>
  <text start="201.81" dur="6.149">Korea and South Korea into unity as one</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="5.61">nation that is what God wants to do and</text>
  <text start="207.959" dur="3.75">I personally believe that is what God is</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="1.589">going to do I think it&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
  <text start="211.709" dur="3.06">to pass</text>
  <text start="212.069" dur="5.431">Kim Clemente prophesied that few years</text>
  <text start="214.769" dur="5.101">ago I just got a message from a friend</text>
  <text start="217.5" dur="4.769">this morning just just a few minutes ago</text>
  <text start="219.87" dur="5.28">really just send me a message he said</text>
  <text start="222.269" dur="6.09">hey I was I was praying and in the</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="5.64">spirit I saw this massive angel standing</text>
  <text start="228.359" dur="4.77">with one foot on sole and one foot was</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="4.77">on a volcanic Mountain in North Korea</text>
  <text start="233.129" dur="4.741">and I heard this angel speaking and I</text>
  <text start="235.56" dur="5.37">heard the voice of God speaking and he</text>
  <text start="237.87" dur="6.899">said that it is a key time and he is</text>
  <text start="240.93" dur="6.6">going to bring together these two</text>
  <text start="244.769" dur="5.491">nations North and South Korea and that</text>
  <text start="247.53" dur="5.01">the he is going to bring freedom to the</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="3.839">people of North Korea so if you know</text>
  <text start="252.54" dur="3.65">anything at all about North Korea you</text>
  <text start="254.099" dur="6.75">know that the people there live in</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="6.729">absolute poverty they are under intense</text>
  <text start="260.849" dur="4.081">political oppression and tyranny there</text>
  <text start="262.919" dur="4.111">is probably no place on earth where</text>
  <text start="264.93" dur="4.859">there&amp;#39;s more intense political</text>
  <text start="267.03" dur="3.3">oppression and tyranny than in North</text>
  <text start="269.789" dur="3.271">Korea</text>
  <text start="270.33" dur="4.74">no these people died there of starvation</text>
  <text start="273.06" dur="5.43">and abuse and neglect</text>
  <text start="275.07" dur="5.92">it&amp;#39;s terrible place to live obviously it</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="4.21">is not God&amp;#39;s desire that</text>
  <text start="280.99" dur="6.45">people in North Korea would be</text>
  <text start="282.7" dur="10.41">persecuted and starved and pressed God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.44" dur="9.12">will his desire is for them to prosper</text>
  <text start="293.11" dur="6">to be healthy to live in freedom okay we</text>
  <text start="296.56" dur="5.31">know that that is God&amp;#39;s will for North</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="7.08">Korea for the people of North Korea he</text>
  <text start="301.87" dur="7.41">wants them to live in freedom and he</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="6.66">wants them to to prosper and to be</text>
  <text start="309.28" dur="6.84">blessed now the question is how is that</text>
  <text start="312.85" dur="6.93">going to happen right now under Kim</text>
  <text start="316.12" dur="6.63">jong-un and under this tyranny it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="319.78" dur="4.83">difficult for for anyone to help them</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="4.05">because Kim jong-un has set up a</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="3.72">situation where no one can really go</text>
  <text start="326.8" dur="4.35">into North Korea and help them</text>
  <text start="328.33" dur="3.87">I mean people from the West churches are</text>
  <text start="331.15" dur="3.87">sending trying to send missionaries</text>
  <text start="332.2" dur="4.74">there to help feed and clothe and take</text>
  <text start="335.02" dur="3.42">care of these people but it&amp;#39;s very hard</text>
  <text start="336.94" dur="6.78">to do that it is such an oppressive</text>
  <text start="338.44" dur="9.81">regime so God wants to change the</text>
  <text start="343.72" dur="9.45">situation of Korea and I believe that he</text>
  <text start="348.25" dur="7.77">has raised up Donald Trump as a way to</text>
  <text start="353.17" dur="5.97">bring freedom to North Korea you may not</text>
  <text start="356.02" dur="5.69">see it that way and a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="359.14" dur="4.77">are even Trump supporters may not</text>
  <text start="361.71" dur="5.02">understand that that&amp;#39;s one of God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="363.91" dur="5.97">plans with Donald Trump but I believe</text>
  <text start="366.73" dur="4.92">after listening to the dreams and the</text>
  <text start="369.88" dur="4.38">visions and revelation that my friends</text>
  <text start="371.65" dur="6.23">have had I believe that God has brought</text>
  <text start="374.26" dur="9.06">President Trump to this time in history</text>
  <text start="377.88" dur="7.84">because during his presidency Donald</text>
  <text start="383.32" dur="5.91">Trump is going to have an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="385.72" dur="6.66">bring freedom to North Korea where Obama</text>
  <text start="389.23" dur="6.42">and the bushes and Clinton and Reagan</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="6.24">everybody else has failed to do it for</text>
  <text start="395.65" dur="5.7">whatever reason various reasons some had</text>
  <text start="398.62" dur="5.49">noble intentions good intentions but</text>
  <text start="401.35" dur="5.39">they failed there&amp;#39;s been a lack of</text>
  <text start="404.11" dur="7.59">willingness to engage and take risks a</text>
  <text start="406.74" dur="6.58">lack of willingness to take risks and if</text>
  <text start="411.7" dur="2.67">there&amp;#39;s one thing you know about Donald</text>
  <text start="413.32" dur="3.3">Trump you</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="4.26">that he is not afraid to take risks all</text>
  <text start="416.62" dur="3.84">right he&amp;#39;s a billionaire real estate</text>
  <text start="418.63" dur="3.78">mogul how do you get to be a billionaire</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="6.9">real estate mogul you take risks you</text>
  <text start="422.41" dur="9.5">invest you build you use strategic</text>
  <text start="427.36" dur="7.41">timing to bring up things to pass that</text>
  <text start="431.91" dur="7">most people wouldn&amp;#39;t have the guts to do</text>
  <text start="434.77" dur="7.14">and Trump is a risk-taker and it may</text>
  <text start="438.91" dur="6">seem like his strategies right now are</text>
  <text start="441.91" dur="4.83">highly risky and some people look at</text>
  <text start="444.91" dur="6">them and say that&amp;#39;s foolish idiotic what</text>
  <text start="446.74" dur="6.239">is he doing the people that I know who</text>
  <text start="450.91" dur="4.229">are getting this revelation from God</text>
  <text start="452.979" dur="4.981">they&amp;#39;re seeing nothing but good things</text>
  <text start="455.139" dur="5.731">in all of this they are seeing the</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="4.95">people of North Korea set free a lot of</text>
  <text start="460.87" dur="4.169">them leaving the country they&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="462.91" dur="6.27">North and South Korea being united as</text>
  <text start="465.039" dur="6.991">one country they are seeing God&amp;#39;s grace</text>
  <text start="469.18" dur="4.95">and mercy poured out on Korea they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="472.03" dur="4.56">seeing a lot of people are actually</text>
  <text start="474.13" dur="4.64">having dreams and visions where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="476.59" dur="5.91">seeing the destruction of Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.77" dur="5.05">circle of power I I do not think Kim</text>
  <text start="482.5" dur="3.599">Jong moon is going to be in power much</text>
  <text start="483.82" dur="6.09">longer he is a paper tiger</text>
  <text start="486.099" dur="6.181">I suspect that his generals want him</text>
  <text start="489.91" dur="6.3">gone but they&amp;#39;re waiting for the right</text>
  <text start="492.28" dur="5.58">opportunity to take to help maybe have a</text>
  <text start="496.21" dur="5.01">political coup or they just get rid of</text>
  <text start="497.86" dur="5.82">him I suspect that in the next in the</text>
  <text start="501.22" dur="5.129">very short term we&amp;#39;re going to see Kim</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="6.63">Jong Un&amp;#39;s little dictatorship collapse</text>
  <text start="506.349" dur="6.781">and there will be a power vacuum and at</text>
  <text start="510.31" dur="5.31">that point if the leaders of the</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="5.909">military are smart they will realize</text>
  <text start="515.62" dur="6.18">this is an opportunity to step into a</text>
  <text start="519.039" dur="5.851">new type of government for North Korea</text>
  <text start="521.8" dur="5.58">that can bring freedom to them and where</text>
  <text start="524.89" dur="4.53">they can move into a kind of government</text>
  <text start="527.38" dur="4.35">that is more in keeping with the rest of</text>
  <text start="529.42" dur="4.5">the rest of the world it&amp;#39;s just I mean</text>
  <text start="531.73" dur="4.979">North Korea is so out of step with every</text>
  <text start="533.92" dur="7.02">other nation in the world I think this</text>
  <text start="536.709" dur="5.401">is a is an amazing opportunity for God</text>
  <text start="540.94" dur="4.589">to move</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="5.43">sensibly in North Korea this is a great</text>
  <text start="545.529" dur="5.401">opportunity for God to show himself</text>
  <text start="547.54" dur="7.109">strong through a president like Donald</text>
  <text start="550.93" dur="5.58">Trump where he can if Trump plays his</text>
  <text start="554.649" dur="5.581">cards right I think he will</text>
  <text start="556.51" dur="5.67">he is use diplomacy and negotiation we</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="4.08">know Trump as a negotiator but like you</text>
  <text start="562.18" dur="4.339">said in that video that was from 18</text>
  <text start="564.31" dur="6.45">years ago his whole thing was look at</text>
  <text start="566.519" dur="6.19">some point you have to disarm and used</text>
  <text start="570.76" dur="4.5">to take out the strength of your</text>
  <text start="572.709" dur="4.891">opponent and it&amp;#39;s better to do it sooner</text>
  <text start="575.26" dur="5.579">than to do it later after he&amp;#39;s had a</text>
  <text start="577.6" dur="6.6">chance to use it against you so I think</text>
  <text start="580.839" dur="5.19">Trump is going to act quickly decisively</text>
  <text start="584.2" dur="3">this is not going to drag out very long</text>
  <text start="586.029" dur="5.161">I didn&amp;#39;t this is going to be over</text>
  <text start="587.2" dur="7.319">quickly the president is escalating the</text>
  <text start="591.19" dur="6.6">situation because he wants to force Kim</text>
  <text start="594.519" dur="7.291">jong-un and China we know that North</text>
  <text start="597.79" dur="6.27">Korea is a proxy for China and he wants</text>
  <text start="601.81" dur="5.16">to get president G of China and kim</text>
  <text start="604.06" dur="5.87">jeong-hoon to he wants to put them in a</text>
  <text start="606.97" dur="6.54">position where they&amp;#39;re forced to make a</text>
  <text start="609.93" dur="5.26">very bold radical move that&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="613.51" dur="4.53">show what they&amp;#39;re going to what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="615.19" dur="4.41">going to do and the president does not</text>
  <text start="618.04" dur="3.84">want this dragged this is dragged out</text>
  <text start="619.6" dur="2.729">for decades already it needs to come to</text>
  <text start="621.88" dur="4.079">an end</text>
  <text start="622.329" dur="6.241">it needs we need a sudden shift and that</text>
  <text start="625.959" dur="4.021">is what is going to happen I think Trump</text>
  <text start="628.57" dur="5.04">is not going to let this thing Fester</text>
  <text start="629.98" dur="6.87">it&amp;#39;s going to happen quickly and I do</text>
  <text start="633.61" dur="6.83">not believe that it&amp;#39;s going to end in</text>
  <text start="636.85" dur="5.91">nuclear war so the fears of nuclear war</text>
  <text start="640.44" dur="4.18">put that out of your mind and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="642.76" dur="3.81">see that happening I don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="644.62" dur="4.17">going to happen the prophetic people</text>
  <text start="646.57" dur="3.959">that I know who are having revelation</text>
  <text start="648.79" dur="4.08">from God about this none of them have</text>
  <text start="650.529" dur="5.041">seen nuclear war none of them have seen</text>
  <text start="652.87" dur="5.31">the end of the world or any widespread</text>
  <text start="655.57" dur="5.699">destruction I think we can I think we</text>
  <text start="658.18" dur="4.68">can probably number one I don&amp;#39;t think we</text>
  <text start="661.269" dur="4.531">need to worry too much about that number</text>
  <text start="662.86" dur="7.11">two we can certainly pray that that does</text>
  <text start="665.8" dur="7.289">not happen and I I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="669.97" dur="6">this as happening as look into some big</text>
  <text start="673.089" dur="7.021">nuclear exchange I think</text>
  <text start="675.97" dur="7.02">that Kim jong-un is a lot of talk and I</text>
  <text start="680.11" dur="5.49">think his talking days are numbered</text>
  <text start="682.99" dur="4.409">just like the hands that appeared on the</text>

  <text start="1105.53" dur="5.279">not my realm but I think from a</text>

  <text start="1110.809" dur="4.831">pastor&amp;#39;s that are surrounding Trump are</text>
  <text start="1112.73" dur="5.94">giving him good prophetic good godly</text>
  <text start="1115.64" dur="6.15">wisdom and insights into how he needs to</text>

  <text start="1121.79" dur="4.47">him you know even if he doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1123.98" dur="5.55">everything else going and he is he does</text>
  <text start="1126.26" dur="5.19">have great instincts he reads people he</text>
  <text start="1129.53" dur="6.33">makes good decisions he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1131.45" dur="6">instinctual like Sebastian Gorka said</text>
  <text start="1135.86" dur="2.49">he&amp;#39;s the most instinctive man I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
