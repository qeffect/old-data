  <text start="133.83" dur="5.1">made simple yeah you know I heard a</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="4.62">pastor years ago say that the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="138.93" dur="4.35">God is the most difficult concept in the</text>
  <text start="141" dur="5.97">Bible to understand because it&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="6.24">very mysterious kind of symbolic kingdom</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="5.1">that Jesus spoke about in parables and</text>
  <text start="149.52" dur="5.58">so a lot of people believe the kingdom</text>
  <text start="152.07" dur="5.52">of God is this great mystery that you</text>
  <text start="155.1" dur="3.63">just can&amp;#39;t understand and there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="157.59" dur="5.49">truth to that</text>
  <text start="158.73" dur="6.78">but I think if you draw close to the</text>
  <text start="163.08" dur="4.26">Lord he will explain and reveal his</text>
  <text start="165.51" dur="3.45">kingdom to you so that&amp;#39;s what I do my</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="2.07">books in the series kingdom of God made</text>
  <text start="168.96" dur="2.49">simple</text>
  <text start="169.41" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s divine healing made simple</text>
  <text start="171.45" dur="3.3">hearing God&amp;#39;s voice made simple seeing</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="2.729">in the spirit made simple</text>
  <text start="174.75" dur="4.86">now there&amp;#39;s traveling in the spirit made</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="5.071">simple and probably the next book to</text>
  <text start="179.61" dur="3.69">come out in the series will be power and</text>
  <text start="181.53" dur="3.54">authority made simple I&amp;#39;ve got a few</text>
  <text start="183.3" dur="4.05">more books planned after that I think</text>
  <text start="185.07" dur="3.96">probably going to be seven or eight</text>
  <text start="187.35" dur="4.2">maybe nine books in this series all</text>
  <text start="189.03" dur="6.33">together so yeah traveling the spirit</text>
  <text start="191.55" dur="6.33">just an insanely cool book the most</text>
  <text start="195.36" dur="4.92">difficult book I&amp;#39;ve written so far it</text>
  <text start="197.88" dur="4.56">was like pushing a meal up a ladder</text>
  <text start="200.28" dur="4.59">getting that book written that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="202.44" dur="4.62">because there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s really no</text>
  <text start="204.87" dur="4.589">reference I mean if you think about it</text>
  <text start="207.06" dur="4.17">like much tougher look some of the other</text>
  <text start="209.459" dur="3.421">books you know he only made simple</text>
  <text start="211.23" dur="3.27">seeing in the spirit you know there have</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="3.54">been other people who have wrote books</text>
  <text start="214.5" dur="5.07">about seeing so you can kind of draw</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="5.91">bits in pieces yeah and simplify it and</text>
  <text start="219.57" dur="4.98">you know even with things like healing</text>
  <text start="222.33" dur="3.93">and singing the spirit and hearing God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.55" dur="3.33">voice so there&amp;#39;s tons of people teaching</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="4.53">on it even if they haven&amp;#39;t written books</text>
  <text start="227.88" dur="5.01">you know Sean bolts and Chris Balaton</text>
  <text start="230.79" dur="3.63">and always guys are really great</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="4.11">teachers and so I learned a lot from</text>
  <text start="234.42" dur="4.38">from other people I&amp;#39;m healing singing</text>
  <text start="237" dur="4.44">the spirit but there aren&amp;#39;t a lot of</text>
  <text start="238.8" dur="5.07">people teaching or writing I&amp;#39;m traveling</text>
  <text start="241.44" dur="4.56">in the spirit so it really came down a</text>
  <text start="243.87" dur="3.51">lot to studying the scriptures and once</text>
  <text start="246" dur="3.42">I got this kind of the biblical</text>
  <text start="247.38" dur="3.3">foundation down I was like okay I got</text>
  <text start="249.42" dur="3.75">that part done I did a lot of</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="4.32">crowdsourcing and asking for testimonies</text>
  <text start="253.17" dur="3.51">which you provided one of the coolest</text>
  <text start="255" dur="3.57">testimonies in the book well thank you</text>
  <text start="256.68" dur="4.619">so much and it was so funny</text>
  <text start="258.57" dur="5.94">because I completely forgot that I</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="4.891">shared an experience which I know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="2.909">hard to talk do not know that your</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="3.93">testimony was going to show up</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="4.381">no I had no idea I had absolutely no</text>
  <text start="270.12" dur="3.18">idea I was excited about the book being</text>
  <text start="271.8" dur="3.06">released because I wanted to read about</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="4.35">it I wanted to see what the heck was</text>
  <text start="274.86" dur="4.739">going on but there there&amp;#39;s their stuff</text>
  <text start="277.65" dur="4.5">that I didn&amp;#39;t share with you that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="279.599" dur="4.65">going to share and I&amp;#39;ve saved for when I</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="4.049">hear that I&amp;#39;ve been asking these</text>
  <text start="284.249" dur="4.371">discussion questions on Facebook for</text>
  <text start="286.199" dur="5.55">years now just collecting testimonies</text>
  <text start="288.62" dur="4.72">answering questions and kind of group</text>
  <text start="291.749" dur="2.341">discussion type things and I&amp;#39;ve learned</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="3.78">a lot from it</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="6.71">but your testimony was very interesting</text>
  <text start="297.12" dur="7.079">to me because it was it was the odd duck</text>
  <text start="300.8" dur="5.26">yeah that&amp;#39;s amazing it stood out from</text>
  <text start="304.199" dur="4.261">all the rest of the testimonies because</text>
  <text start="306.06" dur="4.71">you experienced some things that some</text>
  <text start="308.46" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s that are similar to things people</text>
  <text start="310.77" dur="5.94">experienced when the astral project yes</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="5.43">not the same but similar and so you know</text>
  <text start="316.71" dur="3.75">that was one of the big questions I had</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="3.989">to answer in the book was because I get</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="3.72">this from so many people I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="322.319" dur="4.051">what I write articles I&amp;#39;m traveling the</text>
  <text start="324.18" dur="5.34">spirit the trolls come out of the</text>
  <text start="326.37" dur="5.789">woodwork to bash me and say this is just</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="5.28">astral projection it&amp;#39;s just my age it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="332.159" dur="4.68">all witchcraft though I came to this</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="4.229">point where I had to ask myself honestly</text>
  <text start="336.839" dur="4.44">is this astral projection or not you</text>
  <text start="339.029" dur="4.41">know I didn&amp;#39;t know and I mean I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="341.279" dur="3.841">think it was but the problem is I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.439" dur="4.23">know a lot of people in astral project</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="3.949">I&amp;#39;ve never read any books on it and if</text>
  <text start="347.669" dur="4.081">you don&amp;#39;t know much about that subject</text>
  <text start="349.069" dur="5.291">it&amp;#39;s easy for you to come to the</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="4.349">assumption that maybe it is astral</text>
  <text start="354.36" dur="4.529">projection I mean how do you really know</text>
  <text start="356.099" dur="4.861">so I knew that was one of the questions</text>
  <text start="358.889" dur="5.51">I had to answer interestingly enough</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="7.319">your testimony gave me a really good</text>
  <text start="364.399" dur="5.351">story that I could use to compare the</text>
  <text start="368.279" dur="4.021">things that people experience when they</text>
  <text start="369.75" dur="4.889">asked your project well and I just went</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="3.66">side by side and you know you can see</text>
  <text start="374.639" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s some similarities but you can</text>
  <text start="375.96" dur="4.829">also see the differences it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="378.509" dur="4.231">interesting because I just went to</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="3.99">women&amp;#39;s conference and at this woman&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="382.74" dur="5.099">conference I ran into this pastor friend</text>
  <text start="384.779" dur="4.89">of mine and I was so excited to tell her</text>
  <text start="387.839" dur="3.81">about your book and I couldn&amp;#39;t I was</text>
  <text start="389.669" dur="4.05">like wondering Lord why am I telling her</text>
  <text start="391.649" dur="4.2">about this book and I said it was so</text>
  <text start="393.719" dur="4.081">funny I six I&amp;#39;m in this book too and I</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="5.431">said and he really does a comparison</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="4.83">about astral projection and like what I</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="4.92">and since she goes oh I used to ask your</text>
  <text start="402.63" dur="8.64">project and it just completely oh sudden</text>
  <text start="406.2" dur="8.01">it was like the bracelet Oh what wait a</text>
  <text start="411.27" dur="4.92">second here so I shared that with me and</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="5.16">she said that she only did it once in it</text>
  <text start="416.19" dur="5.46">no the time that she did it was so scary</text>
  <text start="419.37" dur="4.38">it was ridiculously scary she never did</text>
  <text start="421.65" dur="4.29">it again but that was when she was</text>
  <text start="423.75" dur="3.9">tapping into some New Age stuff this is</text>
  <text start="425.94" dur="4.32">before she became a Christian now she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="4.71">a pastor and she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s a she&amp;#39;s a seer</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="3.45">and she&amp;#39;s a prophet and so she&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="432.36" dur="4.32">all this really cool stuff but she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="433.71" dur="5.79">doing it with God but I I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="4.17">very interesting that that people have</text>
  <text start="439.5" dur="3.81">been fascinated I&amp;#39;ve never been</text>
  <text start="440.85" dur="4.02">fascinated with it okay so this is the</text>
  <text start="443.31" dur="3.72">first thing that I did not share with</text>
  <text start="444.87" dur="4.59">you one of the first times that I can</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="5.31">remember where my spirit left my body</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="4.2">was when I was at this church I was at</text>
  <text start="452.34" dur="3.2">this church in Florida that I was</text>
  <text start="453.66" dur="5.43">attending and it was a Southern Baptist</text>
  <text start="455.54" dur="6.4">Church like it&amp;#39;s not the worship that</text>
  <text start="459.09" dur="5.67">you see nowadays okay this is like old</text>
  <text start="461.94" dur="4.38">time hymns but the thing about worship</text>
  <text start="464.76" dur="4.89">is worship is an act and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="466.32" dur="6.03">understand it then but I I do kind of</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="4.56">understand it now so your whole body can</text>
  <text start="472.35" dur="3.54">participate in worship and there were</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="4.41">times that when I would be worshipping</text>
  <text start="475.89" dur="5.73">and singing that I actually would feel</text>
  <text start="478.62" dur="5.94">my spirit floating above the entire</text>
  <text start="481.62" dur="4.35">congregation and I was so afraid I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="484.56" dur="3.15">like I&amp;#39;m not going to open my eyes</text>
  <text start="485.97" dur="3.33">because if I look down and I see people</text>
  <text start="487.71" dur="4.53">sitting in the chairs I&amp;#39;m gonna really</text>
  <text start="489.3" dur="3.989">freak out so but I would be hovering up</text>
  <text start="492.24" dur="2.97">in the ceiling</text>
  <text start="493.289" dur="4.111">and I found myself up there and it</text>
  <text start="495.21" dur="4.14">happened not every single time but it</text>
  <text start="497.4" dur="4.2">happened on more than one occasion but I</text>
  <text start="499.35" dur="5.64">never ever understood it so apparently</text>
  <text start="501.6" dur="7.56">my spirit always was very free to I</text>
  <text start="504.99" dur="5.85">guess leave the vessel I guess yeah I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="509.16" dur="3.39">heard some of your stories and you said</text>
  <text start="510.84" dur="4.499">that you it happens to you a lot at</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="4.83">night yeah a lot but fairly often when</text>
  <text start="515.339" dur="5.7">you get sucked hoovered up out of your</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="6.12">body yeah well that was a very unique</text>
  <text start="521.039" dur="4.201">experience because usually look let me</text>
  <text start="523.5" dur="3.27">just give you guys a backstory just so</text>
  <text start="525.24" dur="4.29">you understand what we&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="526.77" dur="4.8">there was a day I wasn&amp;#39;t feeling good my</text>
  <text start="529.53" dur="3.66">husband said to me three times once you</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="3.27">could take a nap so I did and I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="533.19" dur="4.11">half half away</text>
  <text start="534.84" dur="5.58">kappa sleep when all of a sudden I feel</text>
  <text start="537.3" dur="6.06">this hump and it&amp;#39;s like a vibration now</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="5.46">this has happened to me before while</text>
  <text start="543.36" dur="5.1">I&amp;#39;ve been sleeping I feel this hum and</text>
  <text start="545.88" dur="4.07">at first I was thinking and this is</text>
  <text start="548.46" dur="4.68">after I got filled with the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="5.08">so at first I thought oh my gosh I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="553.14" dur="4.77">being abducted by aliens because this</text>
  <text start="555.03" dur="4.35">was the only thing this is the only</text>
  <text start="557.91" dur="3.63">thing I could equate I&amp;#39;m like oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="4.35">you must be aliens here because I feel</text>
  <text start="561.54" dur="5.91">this hum and and all of a sudden I would</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="5.48">feel my spirits leave my body I know the</text>
  <text start="567.45" dur="4.74">kind of hover and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="569.21" dur="6.64">sucked and there was one time that I</text>
  <text start="572.19" dur="6.06">actually could feel myself I would come</text>
  <text start="575.85" dur="4.62">in come out come in come out and it was</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="4.44">almost like my spirit weld on top of my</text>
  <text start="580.47" dur="5.37">body and it happened like many many</text>
  <text start="582.69" dur="5.49">times and I still I&amp;#39;m like I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="4.23">afraid but I really couldn&amp;#39;t move</text>
  <text start="588.18" dur="3.63">so I was like well if it&amp;#39;s an alien</text>
  <text start="590.07" dur="3.33">saying I can&amp;#39;t really do anything anyway</text>
  <text start="591.81" dur="3.72">because I can&amp;#39;t move but I wasn&amp;#39;t afraid</text>
  <text start="593.4" dur="3.36">so I think that&amp;#39;s really important but</text>
  <text start="595.53" dur="3.48">this one particular time that I was</text>
  <text start="596.76" dur="4.92">taking this nap again I heard this</text>
  <text start="599.01" dur="4.14">humming I felt my body I felt my spirit</text>
  <text start="601.68" dur="4.71">come out of my body and then all of a</text>
  <text start="603.15" dur="5.73">sudden boom I was gone but this is the</text>
  <text start="606.39" dur="5.34">key thing I actually went someplace and</text>
  <text start="608.88" dur="4.71">I saw it and what I saw I was in it</text>
  <text start="611.73" dur="4.71">looked like I was in some sort of a bath</text>
  <text start="613.59" dur="4.71">house so I I could see the wall and I</text>

  <text start="1260.82" dur="5.13">around when Israel is at war with Syria</text>
  <text start="1263.34" dur="5.73">the Syrian King was getting irritated</text>
  <text start="1265.95" dur="4.709">because Israel always seemed to know</text>
  <text start="1269.07" dur="3.929">their battle plans always knew their</text>
  <text start="1270.659" dur="4.171">troop placements so the king said who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1272.999" dur="3.741">the traitor has got a good traitor in</text>
  <text start="1274.83" dur="5.069">the camp someone is giving Israel</text>

  <text start="1287.249" dur="6.3">Israel right prophets are going into the</text>
  <text start="1290.82" dur="4.77">Syrian Kings quarters he was dropping</text>
  <text start="1293.549" dur="3.181">listening in on this in the spirit and</text>
  <text start="1295.59" dur="2.85">then going back and telling the King</text>
  <text start="1296.73" dur="3.569">what&amp;#39;s going on and this is all</text>
  <text start="1298.44" dur="4.319">throughout the Old Testament so you know</text>
  <text start="1300.299" dur="3.09">when when people ask me where is that in</text>
  <text start="1302.759" dur="3.691">the Bible</text>
  <text start="1303.389" dur="5.821">well it&amp;#39;s there just go look for it in</text>
  <text start="1306.45" dur="5.01">New Testament it happens to know I had</text>
  <text start="1309.21" dur="3.87">this guy on a facebook thread I was</text>
  <text start="1311.46" dur="3.51">talking about traveling the spirit and</text>
  <text start="1313.08" dur="4.11">this guy knew better than to say</text>
  <text start="1314.97" dur="4.86">traveling the spirit isn&amp;#39;t in the Bible</text>
  <text start="1317.19" dur="5.52">he knew it was so what he said was none</text>
  <text start="1319.83" dur="4.799">of the disciples of Jesus had a regular</text>
  <text start="1322.71" dur="3.24">practice of traveling in spirit you know</text>
  <text start="1324.629" dur="3.691">it would be okay if you could</text>
  <text start="1325.95" dur="3.99">demonstrate that any of the disciples of</text>
  <text start="1328.32" dur="3.39">Jesus were doing this on a regular basis</text>
  <text start="1329.94" dur="3.989">not that it was just happening once or</text>
  <text start="1331.71" dur="4.319">twice because he knew that Paul got</text>
  <text start="1333.929" dur="2.34">taken up into the heavens so I said have</text>
  <text start="1336.029" dur="3.06">you</text>
  <text start="1336.269" dur="6.09">the book of Revelation and no answer</text>
  <text start="1339.089" dur="6.3">yeah I was like right so the entire book</text>
  <text start="1342.359" dur="5.19">of Revelation is essentially the</text>
  <text start="1345.389" dur="5.76">revelation given to John while he was</text>
  <text start="1347.549" dur="5.7">traveling in the spirit my book and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1351.149" dur="4.56">likely I think that John was was one of</text>
  <text start="1353.249" dur="4.321">those mystic people who had learned to</text>
  <text start="1355.709" dur="4.47">travel in the spirit and learn to engage</text>
  <text start="1357.57" dur="4.319">God and engage the realms of heaven and</text>
  <text start="1360.179" dur="3.96">the book of Revelation is just one of</text>
  <text start="1361.889" dur="4.4">those experiences that he had I think</text>
  <text start="1364.139" dur="4.38">that John probably did have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1366.289" dur="3.85">mystical traveling the spirit</text>
  <text start="1368.519" dur="3.69">experiences I can&amp;#39;t say it for a fact</text>
  <text start="1370.139" dur="4.051">but I suspect he probably did well I</text>
  <text start="1372.209" dur="4.56">think a lot of them did I mean they</text>
  <text start="1374.19" dur="4.859">definitely they saw things in the spirit</text>
  <text start="1376.769" dur="5.4">and I think that&amp;#39;s another thing too if</text>
  <text start="1379.049" dur="4.23">you if you haven&amp;#39;t gotten your spiritual</text>
  <text start="1382.169" dur="2.7">eyes open because that&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="1383.279" dur="4.83">first things that you mentioned in your</text>
  <text start="1384.869" dur="5.701">book is that you really need to see</text>
  <text start="1388.109" dur="5.341">things in a spiritual level to make that</text>
  <text start="1390.57" dur="4.979">experience much more memorable alluring</text>
  <text start="1393.45" dur="3.839">great it is helpful if you have an</text>
  <text start="1395.549" dur="4.23">ability to see in the spirit to see</text>
  <text start="1397.289" dur="5.49">angels and demons and to see the realms</text>
  <text start="1399.779" dur="4.74">of glory it&amp;#39;s not necessary mm-hmm I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1402.779" dur="4.47">been taking people to the courts of</text>
  <text start="1404.519" dur="5.34">heaven a little bit more so glad Rock</text>
  <text start="1407.249" dur="4.11">this up because I know how can you how</text>
  <text start="1409.859" dur="2.88">can you talk about traveling the spirit</text>
  <text start="1411.359" dur="4.05">and really not talk about the court</text>
  <text start="1412.739" dur="4.8">seven right well that that and also</text>
  <text start="1415.409" dur="4.35">being in the throne room of heaven like</text>
  <text start="1417.539" dur="4.38">and I think that&amp;#39;s the the biggest thing</text>
  <text start="1419.759" dur="4.05">is that okay guys I&amp;#39;m just going to say</text>
  <text start="1421.919" dur="4.38">this if you are a son or daughter of God</text>
  <text start="1423.809" dur="4.98">guess what you actually have a</text>
  <text start="1426.299" dur="4.44">birthright to go so if you ever</text>
  <text start="1428.789" dur="2.49">questioned can I go to heaven before I</text>
  <text start="1430.739" dur="3.09">die</text>
  <text start="1431.279" dur="4.71">heck yeah you have a birthright it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1435.989" dur="3.81">where your daddy is okay continues yeah</text>
  <text start="1437.82" dur="4.319">one of the really significant passages</text>
  <text start="1439.799" dur="4.141">that opened the door for me was the</text>
  <text start="1442.139" dur="5.03">passage where Jesus is talked about</text>
  <text start="1443.94" dur="6.029">being the door the door to the Father</text>
  <text start="1447.169" dur="5.08">he&amp;#39;s having a discussion with Thomas he</text>
  <text start="1449.969" dur="4.351">says I&amp;#39;m going to leave and where I go</text>
  <text start="1452.249" dur="4.441">you know and the way you know and Thomas</text>
  <text start="1454.32" dur="3.719">says Lord we do not know the way we do</text>
  <text start="1456.69" dur="4.349">know where you&amp;#39;re going how can we know</text>
  <text start="1458.039" dur="5.64">and Jesus explains to him but I am the</text>
  <text start="1461.039" dur="5.161">door I am the way I am the truth and the</text>
  <text start="1463.679" dur="4.29">light he I am your access to the Father</text>
  <text start="1466.2" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;m your access to heaven and he said</text>
  <text start="1467.969" dur="5.181">I&amp;#39;m going to prepare a place</text>
  <text start="1470.13" dur="5.25">or you that where I am you may be also</text>
  <text start="1473.15" dur="3.7">so where was he going he was going to</text>
  <text start="1475.38" dur="2.13">heaven what was he going to do prepare a</text>
  <text start="1476.85" dur="2.699">place for them</text>
  <text start="1477.51" dur="4.32">when did he want them to go pretty darn</text>
  <text start="1479.549" dur="4.111">quick I mean if you look at the way that</text>
  <text start="1481.83" dur="3.719">whole conversation is constructed in the</text>
  <text start="1483.66" dur="4.17">Greek this wasn&amp;#39;t something that Jesus</text>
  <text start="1485.549" dur="5.01">was saying when you die and your body</text>
  <text start="1487.83" dur="4.68">goes back into the crowd right you can</text>
  <text start="1490.559" dur="3.721">then go into heaven no no what he was</text>
  <text start="1492.51" dur="3.299">telling Thomas and the disciples is</text>
  <text start="1494.28" dur="4.08">here&amp;#39;s the plan</text>
  <text start="1495.809" dur="5.071">heaven has had restricted access up</text>
  <text start="1498.36" dur="4.679">until now but when I go to the cross</text>
  <text start="1500.88" dur="3.96">when I die and I&amp;#39;m resurrected I&amp;#39;m going</text>

  <text start="1516.059" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;ve kind of lost that over the years</text>
  <text start="1518.1" dur="5.309">when we understand what the importance</text>
  <text start="1520.559" dur="5.581">of being able to access heaven I think</text>
  <text start="1523.409" dur="4.5">that people will say wait a second there</text>

  <text start="1831.5" dur="4.74">render the judgment against the spirit</text>
  <text start="1833.96" dur="3.38">very quick but I tell you a couple of</text>
  <text start="1836.24" dur="4.289">things that happened with her that were</text>
  <text start="1837.34" dur="5.469">interesting one is the demon was</text>
  <text start="1840.529" dur="4.831">manifesting in her like crazy while we</text>
  <text start="1842.809" dur="4.891">were doing this now the demon did not</text>
  <text start="1845.36" dur="4.429">manifest much at all and I was on the</text>
  <text start="1847.7" dur="5.01">Skype with her for about an hour and</text>
  <text start="1849.789" dur="4.601">until we went to court and then it</text>
  <text start="1852.71" dur="3.75">started manifesting like crazy I think</text>
  <text start="1854.39" dur="4.769">did not want to go to court the entire</text>
  <text start="1856.46" dur="4.02">time that she&amp;#39;s trying to see and hear</text>
  <text start="1859.159" dur="3.541">what&amp;#39;s going on a court the demon is</text>
  <text start="1860.48" dur="3.9">manifesting and the demon is yelling and</text>
  <text start="1862.7" dur="4.099">screaming things and tried to block her</text>
  <text start="1864.38" dur="5.97">vision so she can&amp;#39;t see what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1866.799" dur="4.781">because the demon knew if I go to court</text>
  <text start="1870.35" dur="2.82">it&amp;#39;s not good</text>
  <text start="1871.58" dur="3.48">so I&amp;#39;m going to try to throw all the</text>
  <text start="1873.17" dur="3.56">things I can to distract her from</text>
  <text start="1875.06" dur="4.83">getting getting in front of the court</text>
  <text start="1876.73" dur="5.08">didn&amp;#39;t work although she was having</text>
  <text start="1879.89" dur="3.39">difficulty some difficulty hearing</text>
  <text start="1881.81" dur="2.4">because the demon was screaming and</text>
  <text start="1883.28" dur="2.97">yelling to her all the time</text>
  <text start="1884.21" dur="3.78">and her face was contorting and</text>
  <text start="1886.25" dur="4.35">twitching and her arm was making</text>
  <text start="1887.99" dur="5.01">involuntary movements and the demon was</text>
  <text start="1890.6" dur="5.25">hissing and screaming and like meowing</text>
  <text start="1893" dur="6.33">like a cat hope you&amp;#39;re doing this it was</text>
  <text start="1895.85" dur="6.33">just was a bit distracting but the cool</text>
  <text start="1899.33" dur="5.82">thing was she was able to for the first</text>
  <text start="1902.18" dur="5.64">time go into the court understand what</text>
  <text start="1905.15" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s about and get a verdict and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1907.82" dur="3.39">been doing this more with people who</text>

  <text start="2369.29" dur="5.01">but I think it was I I think that in</text>
  <text start="2372.29" dur="4.74">that moment the Lord wanted to show me</text>
  <text start="2374.3" dur="6.12">that I wasn&amp;#39;t being punished by him but</text>
  <text start="2377.03" dur="5.88">that this is something see the devil it</text>

  <text start="2874.31" dur="3.9">exactly what happens I mean it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2876.23" dur="5.31">vicious cycle what the enemy does is</text>
  <text start="2878.21" dur="6.659">yeah the enemy finds people and finds</text>
  <text start="2881.54" dur="7.77">ways to provoke you yes to committing</text>
  <text start="2884.869" dur="6.031">sin and then when you do it takes you to</text>
  <text start="2889.31" dur="4.14">court he goes to the court of accusation</text>

  <text start="2899.69" dur="3.69">live in such a way that you&amp;#39;re not being</text>
  <text start="2901.31" dur="4.289">offended that you&amp;#39;re not lashing out not</text>
  <text start="2903.38" dur="3.84">reacting to people don&amp;#39;t give the enemy</text>
  <text start="2905.599" dur="2.97">a whole bunch of ammunition they can use</text>
  <text start="2907.22" dur="3.48">against you in court but you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="2908.569" dur="5.101">about the the contempt of court things</text>
  <text start="2910.7" dur="4.95">is big because if you get a decree of</text>
  <text start="2913.67" dur="4.14">divorce against an evil spirit that</text>
  <text start="2915.65" dur="3.6">doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean that spirit is</text>
  <text start="2917.81" dur="4.049">never going to come around and harass</text>
  <text start="2919.25" dur="5.579">you again right the wager that the</text>
  <text start="2921.859" dur="4.831">Spirit is going to make is that he can</text>
  <text start="2924.829" dur="3.26">come back and continue to harass you and</text>
  <text start="2926.69" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re not going to do anything about it</text>
  <text start="2928.089" dur="4.451">you&amp;#39;re going to fall right back into the</text>
  <text start="2930.38" dur="3.78">behavior and the enemy is going to have</text>
  <text start="2932.54" dur="4.829">to get to play you again like you did</text>
  <text start="2934.16" dur="6.209">before the way to end that cycle is in</text>
  <text start="2937.369" dur="4.081">restraining order no you already have</text>

  <text start="3514.079" dur="5.44">funny thing is a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="3516.819" dur="4.23">never seen Jesus until they go to the</text>
  <text start="3519.519" dur="3.451">court of accusation and they&amp;#39;re like wow</text>
  <text start="3521.049" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s Jesus standing there yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="3524.289" dur="4.891">first time they thought well and and</text>
  <text start="3526.99" dur="5.309">that I think is the other thing too like</text>
  <text start="3529.18" dur="5.939">we we can see Jesus and it&amp;#39;s funny the</text>
  <text start="3532.299" dur="4.621">first Pearl never forget this a good</text>
  <text start="3535.119" dur="3.75">friend of ours Jeremy bhangra Sheen was</text>
  <text start="3536.92" dur="3.689">talking about how he went to India and</text>
  <text start="3538.869" dur="4.081">how he prayed for this woman and this</text>
  <text start="3540.609" dur="5.851">woman saw Jesus and I thought Laura that</text>
  <text start="3542.95" dur="5.609">is so so cool well not too long after</text>
  <text start="3546.46" dur="5.19">that I actually prayed over this woman</text>
  <text start="3548.559" dur="5.611">who was suffering with anorexia and so</text>
  <text start="3551.65" dur="4.919">the Lord said bring her to the mirror so</text>
  <text start="3554.17" dur="3.899">that she could see herself so I and I</text>
  <text start="3556.569" dur="3.181">was thinking because one of the things</text>
  <text start="3558.069" dur="3.931">about anorexia is they don&amp;#39;t like to</text>
  <text start="3559.75" dur="4.559">look at themselves it&amp;#39;s like a big thing</text>
  <text start="3562" dur="4.769">where you see yourself as fat exactly</text>
  <text start="3564.309" dur="4.111">anymore right so I bring her over to the</text>
  <text start="3566.769" dur="3.51">mirror thinking okay God&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="3568.42" dur="3.75">something really cool and let her see</text>
  <text start="3570.279" dur="3.33">herself in a different light so I said</text>
  <text start="3572.17" dur="4.05">what do you see and she&amp;#39;s telling me how</text>
  <text start="3573.609" dur="4.531">she sees the sad person and how ugly and</text>
  <text start="3576.22" dur="3.569">this and that so I put my hands on her</text>
  <text start="3578.14" dur="3.139">and I pray and I said okay now what do</text>
  <text start="3579.789" dur="6.451">you say and then all of a sudden just I</text>
  <text start="3581.279" dur="7.721">see him I&amp;#39;m like who I don&amp;#39;t like wait</text>
  <text start="3586.24" dur="4.859">who do you see she says I I see him and</text>

  <text start="3596.5" dur="4.5">trying to wrap my head around this and</text>
  <text start="3598.75" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m thinking to myself and the Lord said</text>
  <text start="3601" dur="4.289">now I&amp;#39;m smiling at her and I and I said</text>
  <text start="3602.89" dur="4.8">what is he doing she was he&amp;#39;s smiling at</text>

  <text start="3664.49" dur="4.74">says you know if I look in the mirror</text>
  <text start="3666.02" dur="5.67">long she says he shows up it&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="3669.23" dur="4.889">it&amp;#39;s quite annoying and I and so the</text>
  <text start="3671.69" dur="4.05">Lord said to me he goes I&amp;#39;m giving her a</text>
  <text start="3674.119" dur="5.25">longer and longer gap so she has to look</text>
  <text start="3675.74" dur="6.599">in the mirror longer before I appear so</text>
  <text start="3679.369" dur="7.021">it&amp;#39;s making her stare oh yeah those to</text>
  <text start="3682.339" dur="6.391">me is it he Jehovah sneaky but see</text>
  <text start="3686.39" dur="4.229">that&amp;#39;s the thing now she is she was a</text>

  <text start="5196.82" dur="3.87">talk about the courts and I was saying</text>
  <text start="5198.32" dur="4.32">multiple just kind of dabble no we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5200.69" dur="4.8">going to talk about the courts because I</text>

  <text start="5205.49" dur="7.23">for his kids to to come and visit but</text>
  <text start="5209.57" dur="4.47">more importantly to get strategies so</text>
  <text start="5212.72" dur="3.72">that they could become much</text>
  <text start="5214.04" dur="5.01">more effective and efficient here on</text>
  <text start="5216.44" dur="4.11">earth Saudi men that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really</text>

  <text start="5226.58" dur="5.28">game because he&amp;#39;s so awesome but there</text>
  <text start="5228.98" dur="6.39">is there is something that is so much</text>
  <text start="5231.86" dur="5.94">more strategic in what he&amp;#39;s doing and I</text>
  <text start="5235.37" dur="4.98">think that because we are the generation</text>
  <text start="5237.8" dur="4.08">that understands that that understands</text>
  <text start="5240.35" dur="3.99">about we&amp;#39;ve seen these movies about</text>
