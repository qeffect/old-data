  <text start="170.75" dur="4.32">start doing them yourself</text>
  <text start="171.89" dur="4.47">that&amp;#39;s is this how it is you get around</text>
  <text start="175.07" dur="3.66">people that are interested in politics</text>
  <text start="176.36" dur="5.46">you&amp;#39;ll start learning about politics and</text>
  <text start="178.73" dur="8.96">being more politically minded so this is</text>
  <text start="181.82" dur="8.73">the dream that my friend had his name on</text>
  <text start="187.69" dur="5.44">facebook is Al Mac it&amp;#39;s not his real</text>
  <text start="190.55" dur="4.8">name he goes by Northwest prophetic he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="193.13" dur="4.2">got a blog that he writes had an</text>
  <text start="195.35" dur="4.11">interesting dream last night Donald</text>
  <text start="197.33" dur="3.78">Trump and I were walking back to his car</text>
  <text start="199.46" dur="4.26">from the restaurant where we had lunch</text>
  <text start="201.11" dur="5.25">together we were talking about personal</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="4.77">things not political things we never</text>
  <text start="206.36" dur="4.32">made eye contact but the conversation</text>
  <text start="208.49" dur="4.38">was friendly and he was engaged and</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="6.18">polite we were surrounded at a distance</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="6.54">by polite Secret Service agents it was</text>
  <text start="216.86" dur="4.68">not long walk we came to his car the</text>
  <text start="219.41" dur="4.44">armored presidential limousine and I</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="5.31">stepped back so that they could insert</text>
  <text start="223.85" dur="5.22">him into the car he apparently changed</text>
  <text start="226.85" dur="4.59">his mind at the last minute when I</text>
  <text start="229.07" dur="5.12">turned around he was walking off down</text>
  <text start="231.44" dur="5.88">the street wearing a white suit</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="6.1">surrounded by very confused Secret</text>
  <text start="237.32" dur="4.949">Service agents I&amp;#39;m putting this out</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="3.63">there for discussion let&amp;#39;s assume the</text>
  <text start="242.269" dur="5.011">dream is saying something the question</text>
  <text start="243.92" dur="5.849">that becomes what is it saying so I gave</text>
  <text start="247.28" dur="4.08">my interpretation of the dream on his</text>
  <text start="249.769" dur="5.911">facebook thread I&amp;#39;m gonna share it with</text>
  <text start="251.36" dur="5.76">you to me this is very typical the types</text>
  <text start="255.68" dur="5.309">of dreams people are having about the</text>
  <text start="257.12" dur="7.44">president in these dreams people tend to</text>
  <text start="260.989" dur="5.93">be in a very low-key atmosphere with the</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="4.35">president usually at a restaurant or</text>
  <text start="266.919" dur="4.321">talking or they&amp;#39;re at their house and</text>
  <text start="268.91" dur="4.92">they&amp;#39;re discussing things the president</text>
  <text start="271.24" dur="6.37">usually seems very down-to-earth very</text>
  <text start="273.83" dur="5.64">casual like a regular guy and that I</text>
  <text start="277.61" dur="3.84">mean that&amp;#39;s not how all the dreams tend</text>
  <text start="279.47" dur="4.41">to be but in many dreams he&amp;#39;s portrayed</text>
  <text start="281.45" dur="4.86">as very down-to-earth</text>
  <text start="283.88" dur="4.41">easygoing kind of person you could talk</text>
  <text start="286.31" dur="5.82">to that&amp;#39;s the first thing in the dream</text>
  <text start="288.29" dur="7.05">that to me is simply a message from God</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="6.57">saying that the president is a is an</text>
  <text start="295.34" dur="6.99">average guy he&amp;#39;s relatable in ways that</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="6.93">many of us don&amp;#39;t understand he relates</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="6.72">to us as average people he does not see</text>
  <text start="305.63" dur="6.27">himself as higher or better than anyone</text>
  <text start="309.05" dur="5.1">else he kind of sees us as his peers as</text>
  <text start="311.9" dur="3.38">his equals that&amp;#39;s how he is often</text>
  <text start="314.15" dur="4.77">portrayed in dreams</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="7.15">that&amp;#39;s why his language seems to be</text>
  <text start="318.92" dur="6.81">crude and unmeasured and unskilled to</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="6.87">some people there used to really gifted</text>
  <text start="325.73" dur="7.05">orator and people who use 25-dollar</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="6.06">words and whose language is not common</text>
  <text start="332.78" dur="5.01">but the president is a common person</text>
  <text start="335.36" dur="4.86">just like the rest of us and that throws</text>
  <text start="337.79" dur="6.3">a lot of people off but that is how he</text>
  <text start="340.22" dur="6.75">is often portrayed in dreams the second</text>
  <text start="344.09" dur="6.65">part of the dream he&amp;#39;s surrounded by</text>
  <text start="346.97" dur="7.11">Secret Service agents to me that</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="5.26">symbolizes the first thing I thought of</text>
  <text start="354.08" dur="5.73">when I read that was all the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="356" dur="6.69">men he&amp;#39;s surrounded by people advisers</text>
  <text start="359.81" dur="7.28">people who are giving him counsel people</text>
  <text start="362.69" dur="8.61">like Bannon Kushner Sebastian Gorka</text>
  <text start="367.09" dur="7.41">Ivanka people who are his advisers his</text>
  <text start="371.3" dur="6.93">family his friends and his staff and</text>
  <text start="374.5" dur="6.07">what we see in the White House is a</text>
  <text start="378.23" dur="3.51">president who is being advised by all</text>
  <text start="380.57" dur="3.99">these different people he&amp;#39;s surrounded</text>
  <text start="381.74" dur="5.31">by his staff and they&amp;#39;re giving him</text>
  <text start="384.56" dur="4.74">advice and what are a lot of people</text>
  <text start="387.05" dur="4.74">worried about right now they saw Steve</text>
  <text start="389.3" dur="4.32">Bannon resign they saw Sebastian Gorka</text>
  <text start="391.79" dur="4.55">resigned there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="393.62" dur="4.77">think that the president is being</text>
  <text start="396.34" dur="5.14">negatively influenced and he&amp;#39;s getting</text>
  <text start="398.39" dur="5.85">rid of good people because he is being</text>
  <text start="401.48" dur="4.95">influenced by globalists and there is</text>
  <text start="404.24" dur="3.9">this fear and suspicion that the</text>
  <text start="406.43" dur="4.44">president is going down the wrong path</text>
  <text start="408.14" dur="4.32">so a lot of people who were on the Trump</text>
  <text start="410.87" dur="4.68">train are now getting off the Trump</text>
  <text start="412.46" dur="4.98">train because they think that the</text>
  <text start="415.55" dur="4.59">president&amp;#39;s agenda has been severe</text>
  <text start="417.44" dur="5.58">by the deep state or by other you know</text>
  <text start="420.14" dur="4.71">actors whoever they would be when went</text>
  <text start="423.02" dur="4.65">on the face of it when I just look at</text>
  <text start="424.85" dur="7.26">that I think do you understand who</text>
  <text start="427.67" dur="8.16">Donald Trump is he is a 70 year old guy</text>
  <text start="432.11" dur="6.63">who has made a fortune as a real estate</text>
  <text start="435.83" dur="6.42">mogul by making his own decisions using</text>
  <text start="438.74" dur="7.17">his own instincts by moving his own</text>
  <text start="442.25" dur="6.15">agenda forward and he is his own man</text>
  <text start="445.91" dur="5.4">do you honestly think that he is going</text>
  <text start="448.4" dur="4.65">to be moved in the area of foreign</text>
  <text start="451.31" dur="5.34">policy domestic policy or anything else</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="6.18">by the wishes of his son-in-law or his</text>
  <text start="456.65" dur="5.31">daughter I hate to break it to you but</text>
  <text start="459.23" dur="4.89">men like President Trump are not</text>
  <text start="461.96" dur="4.85">motivated by those types of things they</text>
  <text start="464.12" dur="6.09">just aren&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re not influenced as</text>
  <text start="466.81" dur="5.8">much by other people&amp;#39;s ideas as we think</text>
  <text start="470.21" dur="6">they are Trump will listen to other</text>
  <text start="472.61" dur="6.15">people and he will take their advice</text>
  <text start="476.21" dur="5.459">their suggestions he&amp;#39;ll hear them out he</text>
  <text start="478.76" dur="5.34">is a good listener but ultimately at the</text>
  <text start="481.669" dur="6.451">end of the day Trump is going to do what</text>
  <text start="484.1" dur="7.41">Trump wants to do he is his own man he</text>
  <text start="488.12" dur="5.19">is not subject to being manipulated by</text>
  <text start="491.51" dur="4.77">other people&amp;#39;s ideas and thoughts the</text>
  <text start="493.31" dur="4.8">way we think he is so even though he may</text>
  <text start="496.28" dur="3.99">have some globalists and he may have</text>
  <text start="498.11" dur="4.62">some liberals and he may have some you</text>
  <text start="500.27" dur="4.5">know other people with agendas that you</text>
  <text start="502.73" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t agree with in his staff in his</text>
  <text start="504.77" dur="3.72">cabinet it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that those</text>
  <text start="506.39" dur="5.25">people are influencing him it just means</text>
  <text start="508.49" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re filling a position and as you</text>
  <text start="511.64" dur="5.16">look at the president&amp;#39;s business as a</text>
  <text start="514.07" dur="5.88">CEO he&amp;#39;s always been a results person as</text>
  <text start="516.8" dur="5.01">a CEO of his company he&amp;#39;s always looking</text>
  <text start="519.95" dur="3.93">for people who can do the job and can do</text>
  <text start="521.81" dur="4.23">it well and do it efficiently if these</text>
  <text start="523.88" dur="3.75">people don&amp;#39;t do the job don&amp;#39;t do it well</text>
  <text start="526.04" dur="3.48">and aren&amp;#39;t efficient he will get rid of</text>
  <text start="527.63" dur="4.14">them you&amp;#39;re fired</text>
  <text start="529.52" dur="4.92">I&amp;#39;m gonna find somebody else who can do</text>
  <text start="531.77" dur="5.76">it better or he gives people the</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="5.85">opportunity to resign in politics if</text>
  <text start="537.53" dur="4.59">things aren&amp;#39;t working out you go to the</text>
  <text start="540.29" dur="3.99">person and say you know what things</text>
  <text start="542.12" dur="5.15">aren&amp;#39;t working out maybe you should</text>
  <text start="544.28" dur="5.49">consider looking elsewhere and that is a</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="3.52">sign that you need to turn in your</text>
  <text start="549.77" dur="3.3">resignation before</text>
  <text start="550.79" dur="4.05">fire so a lot of people in Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="553.07" dur="3.78">administration end up resigning because</text>
  <text start="554.84" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re not a good fit they&amp;#39;re just not</text>
  <text start="556.85" dur="5.61">a good fit where they are Bannon was not</text>
  <text start="559.43" dur="5.31">a good fit in his position Sebastien</text>
  <text start="562.46" dur="4.38">Gorka never could get his security</text>
  <text start="564.74" dur="4.26">clearance issues straightened out he</text>
  <text start="566.84" dur="3.57">really didn&amp;#39;t like the way the national</text>
  <text start="569" dur="3.69">security council was running things they</text>
  <text start="570.41" dur="5.85">didn&amp;#39;t really care for him Gorka is a</text>
  <text start="572.69" dur="6.06">much better person on the outside when</text>
  <text start="576.26" dur="5.6">you listen to Gorga on Fox and CNN and</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="5.73">MSNBC and he&amp;#39;s going out there</text>
  <text start="581.86" dur="4.24">establishing and arguing in favor of the</text>
  <text start="584.48" dur="4.44">president&amp;#39;s policies he&amp;#39;s a much more</text>
  <text start="586.1" dur="5.58">effective person outside the White House</text>
  <text start="588.92" dur="6.57">on camera so for people who are</text>
  <text start="591.68" dur="6.12">concerned that all these key people like</text>
  <text start="595.49" dur="3.78">Bannon and Gorka leaving if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="597.8" dur="4.89">concerned that that is going to be a</text>
  <text start="599.27" dur="5.1">negative or it&amp;#39;s going to have a bad</text>
  <text start="602.69" dur="4.41">effect on the White House don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="604.37" dur="3.99">concerned it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a plan Trump</text>
  <text start="607.1" dur="4.44">knows what he&amp;#39;s doing he&amp;#39;s a strategist</text>
  <text start="608.36" dur="5.28">and just don&amp;#39;t freak out don&amp;#39;t jump off</text>
  <text start="611.54" dur="4.05">the Trump train and don&amp;#39;t listen to</text>
  <text start="613.64" dur="3.42">these people who are you know running</text>
  <text start="615.59" dur="4.56">their conspiracy theories past you</text>
  <text start="617.06" dur="5.79">because all they&amp;#39;re trying to do is to</text>
  <text start="620.15" dur="4.71">stir up concern and worry and fear for</text>
  <text start="622.85" dur="5.7">no reason all right going back to the</text>
  <text start="624.86" dur="6.57">dream as the president is about to get</text>

  <text start="674.36" dur="5.87">it&amp;#39;s driving or flying and its behavior</text>

  <text start="680.23" dur="7.75">represents how you are functioning spear</text>
  <text start="684.08" dur="5.94">actually so in this dream the president</text>
  <text start="687.98" dur="5.22">is getting going to get into a limousine</text>
  <text start="690.02" dur="5.67">with a bunch of his advisers and then</text>
  <text start="693.2" dur="4.44">decides no I&amp;#39;m going down the road I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="695.69" dur="4.53">going to my own direction I&amp;#39;m leaving my</text>

  <text start="701.63" dur="5.28">I&amp;#39;m not going the direction they want me</text>
  <text start="704.03" dur="6.33">to go and that is the big thing about</text>
  <text start="706.91" dur="7.92">this dream that I see rather than going</text>
  <text start="710.36" dur="6.27">into a vehicle with his advisers and his</text>
  <text start="714.83" dur="4.29">people that surround him and the Secret</text>
  <text start="716.63" dur="5.46">Service he&amp;#39;s going his own way he has a</text>
  <text start="719.12" dur="5.31">sudden epiphany if you will a change of</text>
  <text start="722.09" dur="4.23">heart and he&amp;#39;s walking down the road in</text>
  <text start="724.43" dur="5.42">a different direction and he&amp;#39;s wearing a</text>
  <text start="726.32" dur="6.98">white suit in the scriptures white</text>
  <text start="729.85" dur="7.24">typically represents divinity in</text>
  <text start="733.3" dur="5.98">Revelation when the Apostle John is</text>

  <text start="742.73" dur="5.82">white robe with a golden sash white and</text>
  <text start="746" dur="5.43">dreams typically represents something</text>
  <text start="748.55" dur="5.28">that is heavenly or divine so Trump is</text>
  <text start="751.43" dur="5.79">wearing a white suit what does that mean</text>
  <text start="753.83" dur="6.15">to me that means that he is hearing the</text>
  <text start="757.22" dur="4.41">call of God he is following the divine</text>
  <text start="759.98" dur="4.74">direction that God has put in front of</text>
  <text start="761.63" dur="5.85">him it is found God&amp;#39;s path and then he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="764.72" dur="5.63">gonna follow that path and not go down</text>
  <text start="767.48" dur="7.61">the path that his advisors want him to</text>
  <text start="770.35" dur="7.39">that to me is what I see in this dream I</text>
  <text start="775.09" dur="4.63">have been having a lot of dreams about</text>
  <text start="777.74" dur="4.5">the president I&amp;#39;ve been studying dream</text>
  <text start="779.72" dur="5.16">interpretation for a long time I think</text>
  <text start="782.24" dur="5.16">the dream is significant I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="784.88" dur="4.62">relevant I think it comes at a key time</text>
  <text start="787.4" dur="3.6">when a lot of people are concerned and</text>
  <text start="789.5" dur="3.51">worried about what direction the</text>
  <text start="791" dur="2.97">president is going and they&amp;#39;re concerned</text>
  <text start="793.01" dur="6.06">about the people that are surrounding</text>
  <text start="793.97" dur="7.95">him I think this dream is a confirmation</text>
  <text start="799.07" dur="4.35">to us letting us know we do not have to</text>
  <text start="801.92" dur="3.24">worry about the people that are</text>
  <text start="803.42" dur="3.18">surrounding the president they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="805.16" dur="5.22">influencing the way we think they are</text>
  <text start="806.6" dur="5.66">that the president is making his own</text>
  <text start="810.38" dur="4.05">decisions and that he is actually</text>
  <text start="812.26" dur="5.36">walking in the direction that God wants</text>
  <text start="814.43" dur="5.77">him to walk and it may also porch</text>
  <text start="817.62" dur="4.77">in the future a sudden change of course</text>
  <text start="820.2" dur="4.92">if Trump makes a sudden change of course</text>
  <text start="822.39" dur="4.32">in the near future you&amp;#39;ll know that it</text>
  <text start="825.12" dur="2.58">is a change for the good and not a</text>
  <text start="826.71" dur="3.3">change for the bad</text>
  <text start="827.7" dur="4.17">I trust Trump because I trusted he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="830.01" dur="4.71">following God I trust that he is hearing</text>
  <text start="831.87" dur="5.13">God that he is following the path of</text>
  <text start="834.72" dur="3.96">God&amp;#39;s but before him I trust God and I</text>
  <text start="837" dur="3.24">trust the president and so I don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="838.68" dur="2.94">about this stuff I hope me and my</text>
  <text start="840.24" dur="3.63">friends had dreams about the president</text>
  <text start="841.62" dur="3.78">all the time and when everyone else is</text>
  <text start="843.87" dur="1.92">freaking out and jumping off the Trump</text>
  <text start="845.4" dur="2.879">train</text>
  <text start="845.79" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;re like if you had the dreams that we</text>
  <text start="848.279" dur="4.021">had if you knew what we knew and if you</text>
  <text start="849.72" dur="4.59">just saw the revelation that God was</text>
  <text start="852.3" dur="4.17">showing us you wouldn&amp;#39;t be concerned</text>
  <text start="854.31" dur="4.529">about the president I mean it&amp;#39;s good to</text>
  <text start="856.47" dur="4.71">pray for him and sometimes he does come</text>
  <text start="858.839" dur="4.351">up against some difficult decisions and</text>
  <text start="861.18" dur="5.19">occasionally he might stumble through</text>
  <text start="863.19" dur="5.43">some some of the weeds but overall I</text>
  <text start="866.37" dur="3.21">think there is I really don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="868.62" dur="3.81">there&amp;#39;s much to worry about</text>
  <text start="869.58" dur="5.699">he marches to his own tune marches to</text>
  <text start="872.43" dur="5.64">the beat of his own drum he is not as</text>
  <text start="875.279" dur="5.551">susceptible to the deep state influence</text>
  <text start="878.07" dur="4.08">like people say that he is so not a</text>
  <text start="880.83" dur="6.259">whole lot to worry about I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="882.15" dur="4.939">all right now that we have that done</text>
  <text start="887.779" dur="5.5">when I think about God&amp;#39;s will for</text>
  <text start="891" dur="4.41">healing you can kind of look at some key</text>
  <text start="893.279" dur="5.371">passages in the Old Testament and you</text>
  <text start="895.41" dur="6.03">can see how God was revealing his nature</text>
  <text start="898.65" dur="5.28">to the Israelites and a really good</text>
  <text start="901.44" dur="5.97">example of this is found in the book of</text>
  <text start="903.93" dur="6.06">Exodus where serpents had come into the</text>
  <text start="907.41" dur="6.78">camp of the Israelites and they were</text>
  <text start="909.99" dur="6.81">being stung bitten by serpents and Moses</text>
  <text start="914.19" dur="4.44">went to the Lord and said hey we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="916.8" dur="3.57">all these serpents in the camp they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="918.63" dur="4.05">biting people they&amp;#39;re dying hey what am</text>
  <text start="920.37" dur="6.719">I gonna do about this and the Lord says</text>
  <text start="922.68" dur="6.18">to Moses make a bronze serpent put it on</text>
  <text start="927.089" dur="4.231">a pole and raise it up in the middle of</text>
  <text start="928.86" dur="6.06">the camp and anyone who looks at the</text>
  <text start="931.32" dur="7.55">serpent will be healed for I am Jehovah</text>
  <text start="934.92" dur="6.48">Rapha I am the Lord who heals you in</text>
  <text start="938.87" dur="6.219">that event</text>
  <text start="941.4" dur="5.7">God revealed to the Israelites something</text>
  <text start="945.089" dur="5.151">they didn&amp;#39;t know about him they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="947.1" dur="4.57">know that their God was a healer so</text>
  <text start="950.24" dur="3.14">anyone</text>
  <text start="951.67" dur="4.88">who looked at the bronze serpent on the</text>
  <text start="953.38" dur="6.72">pole was healed of the snake bites</text>
  <text start="956.55" dur="5.8">anyone didn&amp;#39;t matter how bad they were</text>
  <text start="960.1" dur="3.93">how evil how wicked what a sinner they</text>
  <text start="962.35" dur="2.94">were none of that stuff matters didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="964.03" dur="4.2">matter if they were alcoholic or a drug</text>
  <text start="965.29" dur="4.85">addict or a prostitute if they looked at</text>
  <text start="968.23" dur="4.35">the serpent on the pole they were healed</text>
  <text start="970.14" dur="6.72">period all you have to do is look at the</text>
  <text start="972.58" dur="7.14">serpent okay and God revealed to them I</text>
  <text start="976.86" dur="7.02">am Jehovah Rapha</text>
  <text start="979.72" dur="9.33">I am your healer and what that means is</text>
  <text start="983.88" dur="9.04">God&amp;#39;s nature is to heal people that is</text>
  <text start="989.05" dur="6.87">his nature if you get around God and you</text>
  <text start="992.92" dur="5.85">need healing he is he wants to heal you</text>
  <text start="995.92" dur="9.18">he wants to release his healing to you</text>
  <text start="998.77" dur="9.5">that&amp;#39;s who he is so if a dog came to</text>
  <text start="1005.1" dur="6.18">your door outside and started barking</text>
  <text start="1008.27" dur="6.09">are you going to go and tell that dog to</text>
  <text start="1011.28" dur="8.55">stop barking because dogs shouldn&amp;#39;t bark</text>
  <text start="1014.36" dur="8.92">no because it is the nature of dogs to</text>
  <text start="1019.83" dur="6.96">bark it&amp;#39;s what they do right you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1023.28" dur="6.21">tell a dog to stop barking do you teach</text>
  <text start="1026.79" dur="5.039">a dog how to meow like a cat no it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1029.49" dur="4.92">nature of a dog to bark it&amp;#39;s the nature</text>
  <text start="1031.829" dur="5.911">of a cat - miaow it is a nature of God</text>
  <text start="1034.41" dur="6.32">to heal he can&amp;#39;t become a God who</text>
  <text start="1037.74" dur="5.849">doesn&amp;#39;t heal because it&amp;#39;s not his nature</text>
  <text start="1040.73" dur="3.34">trying to just get this through into</text>
  <text start="1043.589" dur="4.951">your mind</text>
  <text start="1044.07" dur="7.71">it is God&amp;#39;s nature to heal us and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1048.54" dur="7.17">an interesting related passage when</text>
  <text start="1051.78" dur="7.95">Jesus came and was speaking before he</text>
  <text start="1055.71" dur="6.75">was crucified he said this this is from</text>
  <text start="1059.73" dur="6.39">John chapter three verses 14 through 17</text>
  <text start="1062.46" dur="6.96">as Moses lifted up the serpent in the</text>
  <text start="1066.12" dur="6.27">wilderness so even so must the Son of</text>
  <text start="1069.42" dur="5.19">Man be lifted up that whoever believes</text>
  <text start="1072.39" dur="4.71">in Him should not perish but have</text>
  <text start="1074.61" dur="4.74">eternal life for God so loved the world</text>
  <text start="1077.1" dur="4.08">that He gave His only Son that whoever</text>
  <text start="1079.35" dur="5.13">believes in Him should not perish but</text>
  <text start="1081.18" dur="5.82">have everlasting life for God did not</text>
  <text start="1084.48" dur="5.189">and his son into the world to condemn it</text>
  <text start="1087" dur="6.419">but that the world through him might be</text>
  <text start="1089.669" dur="6.241">saved so Jesus was taking this event in</text>
  <text start="1093.419" dur="5.491">Exodus and he said in the same way that</text>
  <text start="1095.91" dur="4.59">God revealed his healing nature through</text>
  <text start="1098.91" dur="4.2">the Serpent and the wilderness where</text>
  <text start="1100.5" dur="6.21">people could be healed Moses lifted up</text>
  <text start="1103.11" dur="8.01">the serpent on the pole I will be lifted</text>
  <text start="1106.71" dur="7.469">up on a pole so that whoever believes in</text>
  <text start="1111.12" dur="3.929">me can be healed and can have</text>
  <text start="1114.179" dur="4.561">everlasting life</text>
  <text start="1115.049" dur="7.081">his crucifixion is a display of God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1118.74" dur="7.41">love and mercy and grace to all mankind</text>
  <text start="1122.13" dur="6.15">the entire world everybody when Jesus</text>

  <text start="1147.15" dur="4.01">and he this is what he said about it an</text>
  <text start="1149.07" dur="5.099">event that had not yet happened in time</text>
  <text start="1151.16" dur="5.53">surely he has borne our griefs and</text>

  <text start="1293.97" dur="3.9">does Jesus think he is telling this guy</text>
  <text start="1295.47" dur="4.5">his sins are forgiven so he says which</text>
  <text start="1297.87" dur="4.83">is easier to say to him take up your mat</text>
  <text start="1299.97" dur="4.8">and walk or your sins are forgiven but</text>
  <text start="1302.7" dur="4.979">so that you may know that the Son of man</text>
  <text start="1304.77" dur="6.029">has power on earth to forgive sins he</text>
  <text start="1307.679" dur="5.48">said to the paralytic I say to you take</text>
  <text start="1310.799" dur="4.23">up your mat and walk</text>
  <text start="1313.159" dur="4.9">interesting a little conundrum here</text>
  <text start="1315.029" dur="5.52">first of all the the paralytic gets up</text>
  <text start="1318.059" dur="6.301">picks up his bed that they lowered him</text>
  <text start="1320.549" dur="6.061">down on and he walks and now you have a</text>
  <text start="1324.36" dur="5.1">little issue here first of all Jesus</text>
  <text start="1326.61" dur="4.71">forgave his sins and secondly he healed</text>
  <text start="1329.46" dur="4.65">him physically and he didn&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="1331.32" dur="5.479">touch him didn&amp;#39;t put mud on him he just</text>
  <text start="1334.11" dur="5.549">told him pick up your mat and walk I</text>
  <text start="1336.799" dur="5.26">have come to an understanding about</text>
  <text start="1339.659" dur="3.811">healing that there are many different</text>
  <text start="1342.059" dur="4.381">ways in which people can be healed</text>
  <text start="1343.47" dur="4.76">you can release power you can exercise</text>
  <text start="1346.44" dur="3.93">authority and command things to leave</text>
  <text start="1348.23" dur="3.79">you can also make a prophetic</text>
  <text start="1350.37" dur="3.42">declaration</text>
  <text start="1352.02" dur="3.51">and that&amp;#39;s what Jesus did in that to get</text>
  <text start="1353.79" dur="4.41">this guy healed he just told the guy</text>
  <text start="1355.53" dur="5.1">look pick up your mat and walk</text>
  <text start="1358.2" dur="6.6">when he was telling him is do a</text>
  <text start="1360.63" dur="6.06">prophetic act in faith believing that</text>
  <text start="1364.8" dur="6.92">you can do something that you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1366.69" dur="7.77">and the guy had to exercise his will and</text>
  <text start="1371.72" dur="4.45">straighten out his arms and straighten</text>
  <text start="1374.46" dur="4.68">out his legs and tried to get up and</text>
  <text start="1376.17" dur="7.44">walk if he would not have exercised</text>
  <text start="1379.14" dur="7.02">faith and tried to get up and walk he</text>
  <text start="1383.61" dur="4.5">wouldn&amp;#39;t have been healed I have</text>
  <text start="1386.16" dur="3.54">actually I know of many testimonies of</text>
  <text start="1388.11" dur="3.66">people who have been paralytics and</text>
  <text start="1389.7" dur="5.34">wheelchairs where the person came to</text>
  <text start="1391.77" dur="5.37">them and pranked for them and said I</text>
  <text start="1395.04" dur="4.23">believe the Lord wants you to try to get</text>
  <text start="1397.14" dur="4.95">up out of this wheelchair and walk and I</text>
  <text start="1399.27" dur="5.34">have seen video of people of one woman</text>
  <text start="1402.09" dur="4.17">had multiple sclerosis for 30 years she</text>
  <text start="1404.61" dur="4.44">was in a wheelchair they were praying</text>
  <text start="1406.26" dur="4.23">over her and she it took her a while of</text>
  <text start="1409.05" dur="3.33">struggling but she got up out of her</text>
  <text start="1410.49" dur="6.93">wheelchair and she walked across a</text>
  <text start="1412.38" dur="7.74">platform and that was her healing so one</text>
  <text start="1417.42" dur="4.71">way in which God can heal people or</text>
  <text start="1420.12" dur="6.33">people can be healed is to exercise</text>
  <text start="1422.13" dur="7.35">faith by obeying the command of God and</text>
  <text start="1426.45" dur="6.96">that&amp;#39;s what this paralytic did he was</text>
  <text start="1429.48" dur="7.98">told by Jesus get up and walk and he</text>
  <text start="1433.41" dur="8.25">exercised faith and that faith healed</text>
  <text start="1437.46" dur="7.68">him now it does not mean that you have</text>
  <text start="1441.66" dur="6.899">to have faith in order to be healed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1445.14" dur="5.52">only one of many ways to be healed do</text>
  <text start="1448.559" dur="3.471">not think that because you haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="1450.66" dur="5.01">healed it doesn&amp;#39;t mean you have faith</text>
  <text start="1452.03" dur="5.14">not going down that road many of the</text>
  <text start="1455.67" dur="3.15">people that I have prayed with that have</text>
  <text start="1457.17" dur="4.5">been healed did not have faith they were</text>
  <text start="1458.82" dur="4.92">still healed I have at times prayed for</text>
  <text start="1461.67" dur="5.16">people out of total unbelief and doubt</text>
  <text start="1463.74" dur="5.819">and they got healed anyway so don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="1466.83" dur="4.68">bad if you haven&amp;#39;t been healed don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1469.559" dur="3.961">think oh gosh I don&amp;#39;t have enough faith</text>
  <text start="1471.51" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s my fault no don&amp;#39;t think that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1473.52" dur="6.57">just using this as an illustration it</text>
  <text start="1477.51" dur="5.07">shows one of the ways in which God heals</text>
  <text start="1480.09" dur="3.12">people but not all of them there&amp;#39;s many</text>
  <text start="1482.58" dur="3.27">different ways</text>
  <text start="1483.21" dur="5.04">if you look through Matthew chapter 8</text>
  <text start="1485.85" dur="7.82">Matthew chapter 9 in Matthew chapter 10</text>
  <text start="1488.25" dur="8.4">that those three chapters are a super</text>
  <text start="1493.67" dur="5.77">descriptive lesson on healing the many</text>
  <text start="1496.65" dur="4.32">ways God heals you&amp;#39;ll see healing</text>
  <text start="1499.44" dur="4.26">through through exercise of authority</text>
  <text start="1500.97" dur="7.35">the release of faith you&amp;#39;ll see healing</text>
  <text start="1503.7" dur="5.82">by touch power Jesus putting mud in a</text>
  <text start="1508.32" dur="3.33">blind man&amp;#39;s eye you&amp;#39;ll see many</text>
  <text start="1509.52" dur="5.04">different types of healing casting out</text>
  <text start="1511.65" dur="4.98">demons all different times those three</text>
  <text start="1514.56" dur="3.6">chapters Matthew 8 9 and 10 are really</text>
  <text start="1516.63" dur="3.18">really good if you if you want to learn</text>
  <text start="1518.16" dur="4.62">about healing study those three chapters</text>
  <text start="1519.81" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s it will open your eyes as to how</text>
  <text start="1522.78" dur="4.17">God actually heals people there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1524.4" dur="4.92">of different ways he does it you if you</text>
  <text start="1526.95" dur="4.56">start to exercise that faith if you</text>
  <text start="1529.32" dur="3">start to step out if you cross that</text>
  <text start="1531.51" dur="2.76">chicken line</text>
  <text start="1532.32" dur="4.65">and you start laying hands on people</text>
  <text start="1534.27" dur="5.19">expecting them to be healed you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1536.97" dur="4.92">to see people healed I&amp;#39;m telling you the</text>
  <text start="1539.46" dur="5.43">only way it&amp;#39;s ever gonna happen is if</text>
  <text start="1541.89" dur="5.94">you step out and just exercise a little</text>
  <text start="1544.89" dur="4.62">bit of faith and take a chance and lay</text>
  <text start="1547.83" dur="3.45">some hands on people and try to get them</text>
  <text start="1549.51" dur="7.61">healed you will eventually see them</text>
  <text start="1551.28" dur="10.73">healed alright so what a key passage to</text>
  <text start="1557.12" dur="10.65">think about in the realm of healing is</text>
  <text start="1562.01" dur="8.38">John 10:10 in that passage Jesus said</text>
  <text start="1567.77" dur="5.17">the thief comes to steal kill and</text>
  <text start="1570.39" dur="4.4">destroy I have come that you might have</text>
  <text start="1572.94" dur="5.52">life and that more abundantly</text>
  <text start="1574.79" dur="4.45">so Jesus Illustrated the reality of two</text>
  <text start="1578.46" dur="2.49">different kingdoms</text>
  <text start="1579.24" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s the kingdom of darkness than</text>
  <text start="1580.95" dur="5.37">this kingdom of light and what does the</text>
  <text start="1583.14" dur="6.83">kingdom of darkness do it is all about</text>
  <text start="1586.32" dur="6.72">stealing killing and destroying if</text>
  <text start="1589.97" dur="5.35">someone has had their stuff stolen if</text>
  <text start="1593.04" dur="5.25">someone has died has been made sick it</text>
  <text start="1595.32" dur="5.28">is the work of the kingdom of darkness</text>
  <text start="1598.29" dur="5.76">it is the work of Satan it is the work</text>
  <text start="1600.6" dur="5.79">of demons and fallen angels all of that</text>
  <text start="1604.05" dur="5.67">stuff falls under the category of the</text>
  <text start="1606.39" dur="6.63">works of the king of darkness all right</text>
  <text start="1609.72" dur="8.1">jesus said I have come that you might</text>
  <text start="1613.02" dur="6.379">have life in John chapter 3 he said the</text>
  <text start="1617.82" dur="6.26">son has not come into the</text>
  <text start="1619.399" dur="7.801">world to condemn it but to save it so</text>
  <text start="1624.08" dur="6.599">Jesus is here not to condemn but to save</text>
  <text start="1627.2" dur="6.899">to give life and to bring healing in the</text>
  <text start="1630.679" dur="6.36">Gospels every time anyone wanted to be</text>
  <text start="1634.099" dur="7.56">healed and they came to Jesus He healed</text>
  <text start="1637.039" dur="6.27">them no exceptions at all everyone who</text>
  <text start="1641.659" dur="4.531">wanted to be healed got healed all who</text>
  <text start="1643.309" dur="5.55">were afflicted with demons were set free</text>
  <text start="1646.19" dur="6.569">everyone without exception Jesus never</text>
  <text start="1648.859" dur="5.971">told anyone it&amp;#39;s the Father&amp;#39;s will that</text>
  <text start="1652.759" dur="3.84">you are not healed because he&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="1654.83" dur="3.329">out something in your life because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1656.599" dur="4.2">building your character because he needs</text>
  <text start="1658.159" dur="5.85">you to suffer he&amp;#39;s trying to do some</text>
  <text start="1660.799" dur="5.911">divine work in your life Jesus never</text>
  <text start="1664.009" dur="5.49">told anyone that they couldn&amp;#39;t be healed</text>
  <text start="1666.71" dur="6.87">or that they shouldn&amp;#39;t be healed it says</text>
  <text start="1669.499" dur="8.821">that he healed entire villages now if it</text>
  <text start="1673.58" dur="8.219">is God&amp;#39;s will for us to be sick to teach</text>
  <text start="1678.32" dur="5.399">us lessons to build character then no</text>
  <text start="1681.799" dur="5.401">one in history frustrated the will of</text>
  <text start="1683.719" dur="5.31">God more than Jesus because jesus healed</text>
  <text start="1687.2" dur="3.929">entire villages of people of all</text>
  <text start="1689.029" dur="5.911">sickness all disease and cast out all</text>
  <text start="1691.129" dur="7.77">their demons that demonstrates the will</text>
  <text start="1694.94" dur="6.63">of God He healed everyone Jesus is the</text>
  <text start="1698.899" dur="4.5">exact representation of the Father Jesus</text>
  <text start="1701.57" dur="4.5">said if you have seen me you have seen</text>
  <text start="1703.399" dur="4.77">the father right you&amp;#39;re gonna know what</text>
  <text start="1706.07" dur="3.569">the father looks like look at me the</text>

  <text start="1716.479" dur="5.971">and Jesus loves you and wants to heal</text>
  <text start="1718.7" dur="7.409">you know Jesus represents the</text>
  <text start="1722.45" dur="7.589">personality and the will of the Father I</text>
  <text start="1726.109" dur="7.2">have a friend named Ken Nicholls ken has</text>
  <text start="1730.039" dur="4.531">been used to do healing for a long time</text>
  <text start="1733.309" dur="4.651">you know I have been friends on Facebook</text>
  <text start="1734.57" dur="5.669">for four years ken has had some amazing</text>
  <text start="1737.96" dur="5.339">dreams where God has given him</text>
  <text start="1740.239" dur="5.88">revelation about healing ken had been</text>
  <text start="1743.299" dur="5.28">wrestling with this question about did</text>
  <text start="1746.119" dur="4.77">Jesus have blanket authority to heal</text>
  <text start="1748.579" dur="4.21">anyone he wanted to or did he have</text>
  <text start="1750.889" dur="4.54">specific authority from the</text>
  <text start="1752.789" dur="5.19">to heal only certain people and then he</text>
  <text start="1755.429" dur="5.37">kind of extrapolated that question into</text>
  <text start="1757.979" dur="5.31">his own life and his question was do I</text>
  <text start="1760.799" dur="5.01">have authority from God to heal anyone I</text>
  <text start="1763.289" dur="6.12">want to or do I only have specific</text>
  <text start="1765.809" dur="4.83">authority to heal certain people so one</text>
  <text start="1769.409" dur="4.11">night he had this dream I&amp;#39;m gonna read</text>
  <text start="1770.639" dur="4.801">it to you in the dream I was sitting in</text>
  <text start="1773.519" dur="4.561">an empty room on a chair and I was</text>
  <text start="1775.44" dur="5.189">praying and asking Jesus about this</text>
  <text start="1778.08" dur="4.799">question in the room there were couches</text>
  <text start="1780.629" dur="4.14">and other chairs around the table I had</text>
  <text start="1782.879" dur="4.35">my head slightly down and facing</text>
  <text start="1784.769" dur="4.83">straight ahead as I was praying and</text>
  <text start="1787.229" dur="4.8">asking for clarity Jesus walked into the</text>
  <text start="1789.599" dur="5.46">room off to my side I felt his presence</text>
  <text start="1792.029" dur="5.94">I heard his voice and the atmosphere</text>
  <text start="1795.059" dur="6.48">shifted he physically walked in not like</text>
  <text start="1797.969" dur="6.78">some spiritual eyes visitation he said I</text>
  <text start="1801.539" dur="6">hereby give you specific authority to</text>
  <text start="1804.749" dur="6.571">heal all the sick the infirm and the</text>
  <text start="1807.539" dur="5.94">hurting that clears that up I want all</text>
  <text start="1811.32" dur="4.469">of them healed but you will never be</text>
  <text start="1813.479" dur="5.67">able to reach all of them so whoever you</text>
  <text start="1815.789" dur="5.88">choose to minister to I not only want</text>
  <text start="1819.149" dur="6.12">them healed I expect them to be healed</text>
  <text start="1821.669" dur="6.3">I&amp;#39;ll be there and watching you what you</text>
  <text start="1825.269" dur="5.431">do and how determined you are to see</text>
  <text start="1827.969" dur="5.16">them made well once you decide to</text>
  <text start="1830.7" dur="4.259">minister to this one or that one you</text>
  <text start="1833.129" dur="4.941">have the responsibility to their healing</text>
  <text start="1834.959" dur="5.94">unless they choose to walk away from it</text>
  <text start="1838.07" dur="4.63">what came to me in my mind in the dream</text>
  <text start="1840.899" dur="4.47">was similar to what John G Lake said in</text>
  <text start="1842.7" dur="4.559">his divine healing technicians to do for</text>
  <text start="1845.369" dur="3.99">before they graduate from his training</text>
  <text start="1847.259" dur="3.96">he gave them a name of someone in the</text>
  <text start="1849.359" dur="3.75">community typically terminally ill or</text>
  <text start="1851.219" dur="3.93">incurable he told them to go out and</text>
  <text start="1853.109" dur="3.3">heal them and come back and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1855.149" dur="3.78">heal them don&amp;#39;t come back</text>
  <text start="1856.409" dur="4.59">Jesus then said to me this is still in</text>
  <text start="1858.929" dur="4.29">the dream you now have specific</text>
  <text start="1860.999" dur="5.16">authority right for me and you never</text>
  <text start="1863.219" dur="5.46">have to wonder a question again but it</text>
  <text start="1866.159" dur="4.83">comes with responsibilities as well if</text>
  <text start="1868.679" dur="4.05">you give up and if you try and fail I</text>
  <text start="1870.989" dur="4.38">want you to come back here and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1872.729" dur="6.68">talk I want all of them healed remember</text>
  <text start="1875.369" dur="6.39">that then the dream ended I have had</text>
  <text start="1879.409" dur="5.44">hundreds of dreams over the last eight</text>
  <text start="1881.759" dur="4.681">or nine years where I&amp;#39;ve seen myself</text>
  <text start="1884.849" dur="5.43">praying for people in the ambulance</text>
  <text start="1886.44" dur="7.109">to be healed oftentimes at the end of a</text>
  <text start="1890.279" dur="5.821">day or a week where I prayed for 10 12</text>
  <text start="1893.549" dur="3.33">15 people and nobody was healed and I</text>
  <text start="1896.1" dur="3.24">doubt it</text>
  <text start="1896.879" dur="5.25">and I questioned does God really want</text>
  <text start="1899.34" dur="4.26">these people healed and what I found was</text>
  <text start="1902.129" dur="3.42">whenever I was about ready to give up</text>
  <text start="1903.6" dur="4.799">and quit I&amp;#39;d have a dream and I would</text>
  <text start="1905.549" dur="5.281">see myself in the ambulance praying for</text>
  <text start="1908.399" dur="5.28">someone to be healed so I kept going and</text>
  <text start="1910.83" dur="4.11">I kept going and I kept going even</text>
  <text start="1913.679" dur="3.87">though the first few hundred people I</text>
  <text start="1914.94" dur="5.939">prayed for were not healed I kept going</text>
  <text start="1917.549" dur="5.791">because God kept on urging me and</text>
  <text start="1920.879" dur="4.77">pushing me forward to develop faith and</text>
  <text start="1923.34" dur="4.799">to learn more about healing the things</text>

  <text start="1945.57" dur="4.349">really does keep on praying one of the</text>
  <text start="1948.419" dur="4.26">most difficult things about learning to</text>
  <text start="1949.919" dur="4.89">operate and healing is persistence it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1952.679" dur="3.24">great when miracles happen but sometimes</text>
  <text start="1954.809" dur="3.87">you have to keep going and keep going</text>
  <text start="1955.919" dur="5.191">and keep going I&amp;#39;ve had some really good</text>
  <text start="1958.679" dur="5.811">testimonies from people who I prayed</text>

  <text start="2139.849" dur="4.2">healing miracles praying for someone to</text>
  <text start="2142.069" dur="4.651">be healed is a little bit like walking</text>

  <text start="2167.6" dur="5.54">how long it&amp;#39;s going to take and healing</text>
  <text start="2170.77" dur="5.2">involves a lot of different factors</text>
