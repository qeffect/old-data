  <text start="0.979" dur="6.61">alright another so while back I was with</text>
  <text start="4.89" dur="4.169">some friends of bill and may agreement</text>
  <text start="7.589" dur="2.941">and I was at their house and we were</text>
  <text start="9.059" dur="5.04">having a meeting with a group of people</text>
  <text start="10.53" dur="5.46">and in this meeting I was waiting on the</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="3.721">Lord and just asking the Lord we were</text>
  <text start="15.99" dur="4.53">praying for one guy he had just left the</text>
  <text start="17.82" dur="4.98">ministry and he was trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="20.52" dur="5.249">what he was going to do and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="22.8" dur="5.43">waiting and I really don&amp;#39;t like talking</text>
  <text start="25.769" dur="4.291">to people about their finances not</text>
  <text start="28.23" dur="4.23">because I think money is evil it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="30.06" dur="3.99">because for so many years have been so</text>
  <text start="32.46" dur="3.3">bad with money I feel like I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="3.33">any way of talking to anybody by the way</text>
  <text start="35.76" dur="3.51">if you guys ever realized that we</text>
  <text start="37.38" dur="4.109">discount ourselves to hear God in arena</text>
  <text start="39.27" dur="3.93">because we&amp;#39;re so we&amp;#39;re so not</text>
  <text start="41.489" dur="3.031">functioning very well in that arena so</text>
  <text start="43.2" dur="3.929">we think why can&amp;#39;t talk to people</text>
  <text start="44.52" dur="5.19">alright so I see this vision where the</text>
  <text start="47.129" dur="5.461">Lord comes with a big bag of money and</text>
  <text start="49.71" dur="4.739">throws it at his doorstep and I thought</text>
  <text start="52.59" dur="3.66">you know that can&amp;#39;t be the lord I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="54.449" dur="3.811">know if you guys ever do this Jesus</text>
  <text start="56.25" dur="4.649">doesn&amp;#39;t care about money all Jesus&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="58.26" dur="4.26">into is to be spiritual it&amp;#39;s to be</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="4.521">poverty-stricken all these other things</text>
  <text start="62.52" dur="5.279">that I had were wrong worldviews and</text>
  <text start="65.42" dur="3.58">this guy I said Jenna I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="67.799" dur="2.881">this is the Lord or not but I saw the</text>

  <text start="151.53" dur="5.04">time I was a junior no sophomore in high</text>

  <text start="177.54" dur="6.54">a desperate place in your life you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="180.12" dur="5.28">wet ready to listen to god&amp;#39;s wisdom so</text>
  <text start="184.08" dur="3.15">when you assume that you have everything</text>
  <text start="185.4" dur="3.87">figured out you&amp;#39;re not ready to talk to</text>
  <text start="187.23" dur="3.57">the word about anything right so I</text>
  <text start="189.27" dur="4.08">remember standing before the Lord going</text>
  <text start="190.8" dur="4.14">I do not know how to reach my do not</text>
  <text start="193.35" dur="3.06">know how to love my kids I just don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="196.41" dur="3.39">lord just said Brian that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="198.3" dur="6.81">been waiting for you to say I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="199.8" dur="6.659">show you how to father your children let</text>
  <text start="205.11" dur="5.67">me give you an example of this and then</text>
  <text start="206.459" dur="5.731">we&amp;#39;ll move on with the teaching so again</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="2.7">bill and Meg they had a parenting</text>
  <text start="212.19" dur="2.519">seminar and they talked about what you</text>
  <text start="213.48" dur="3.18">need to date your kids and I thought</text>
  <text start="214.709" dur="4.951">date my kids how do you do that and so I</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="5.25">i sat down at that time I was carrying</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="3.81">around a Franklin planner you guys know</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="3.51">what that is and I had a really big one</text>
  <text start="223.47" dur="3.3">and so I put out the monthly calendar</text>
  <text start="225.42" dur="3.39">and I was just sitting before the Lord</text>
  <text start="226.77" dur="3.12">and I said now all right I need to date</text>
  <text start="228.81" dur="3.27">my kids what you want me to do and you</text>
  <text start="229.89" dur="5.22">said just take a pin mark through every</text>
  <text start="232.08" dur="4.56">wednesday and those are your special day</text>
  <text start="235.11" dur="2.879">with each one of your children you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="3.93">going to take every week and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="237.989" dur="4.47">going to date an individual child now</text>
  <text start="240.57" dur="4.23">what I thought that meant was I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="3.991">to take my Bible with my kids on the day</text>
  <text start="244.8" dur="2.76">and we&amp;#39;re going to pull out Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="3.72">and i&amp;#39;m going to say now let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="247.56" dur="4.74">about the sacrifices for a moment now</text>
  <text start="250.17" dur="3.69">what does this mean now there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="252.3" dur="3">wrong talking of the Bible with your</text>
  <text start="253.86" dur="3.54">children but they&amp;#39;re not ready for</text>
  <text start="255.3" dur="3.659">theology in fact the Lord had to tell me</text>
  <text start="257.4" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re not to take your Bible on the</text>
  <text start="258.959" dur="4.291">date he said I want you to walk up to</text>
  <text start="261.72" dur="4.17">and my daughter was four years old when</text>
  <text start="263.25" dur="3.51">we started this she&amp;#39;s 20 and I walked up</text>
  <text start="265.89" dur="3.36">to her and I said</text>
  <text start="266.76" dur="4.32">and I got down on my knees I said Amanda</text>
  <text start="269.25" dur="3.9">I would like to take you on a date where</text>
  <text start="271.08" dur="3.87">would you like to go and at that time</text>
  <text start="273.15" dur="3.3">the little mermaid was out and she goes</text>
  <text start="274.95" dur="3.39">I want to go see the little mermaid I</text>
  <text start="276.45" dur="3.06">thought but this has nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="278.34" dur="2.16">the Bible and so I thought well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="279.51" dur="2.85">going to sit in the audience and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="280.5" dur="4.38">going to try to give scriptural</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="4.17">principles to the little mermaid and and</text>
  <text start="284.88" dur="3.24">the Lord had to actually confront me and</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="5.82">say Brian you&amp;#39;re actually supposed to</text>
  <text start="288.12" dur="5.94">have fun now I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys</text>
  <text start="292.35" dur="3.84">realize this but there are several</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="4.32">people that live on this planet there so</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="4.49">intense for like revival and stuff like</text>
  <text start="298.38" dur="4.56">that that they can&amp;#39;t enjoy anything</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="4.39">until a revival comes well I&amp;#39;m one of</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="4.83">those kind of people I am waiting for a</text>
  <text start="305.07" dur="4.14">revival and has to come and so this is</text>
  <text start="307.77" dur="3.21">all I ever talk about and God had to</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="5.28">tell me in fact here&amp;#39;s what he also told</text>
  <text start="310.98" dur="5.88">me he said Brian you&amp;#39;re boring now that</text>
  <text start="314.49" dur="3.6">was a lot of fun I actually didn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="316.86" dur="3.18">that was the Lord when he first told it</text>
  <text start="318.09" dur="3.36">to me I thought how could I be boring he</text>
  <text start="320.04" dur="3.09">says you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re so focused in</text>
  <text start="321.45" dur="3.18">one arena you&amp;#39;re missing a lot of things</text>
  <text start="323.13" dur="4.77">that I&amp;#39;ve given you your children or a</text>
  <text start="324.63" dur="5.64">gift so I take my daughter on a date I</text>

  <text start="333.48" dur="4.05">she gets the big thing of popcorn and</text>
  <text start="334.8" dur="6.18">then we get like the 64 ounce thing of</text>
  <text start="337.53" dur="5.39">soda okay so we eat all that we drank</text>
  <text start="340.98" dur="4.71">all that and I was violently sick and</text>
  <text start="342.92" dur="4.9">and she was just having a blast right</text>
  <text start="345.69" dur="3.36">and we&amp;#39;re on our way home and I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="3.15">trying to keep I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="349.05" dur="3.75">if I need to pull over and be sick on</text>
  <text start="350.97" dur="4.17">the side of the road and she&amp;#39;s she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="5.07">happy and she&amp;#39;s singing all of Ariel</text>
  <text start="355.14" dur="4.53">songs and all this other stuff and she</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="3.54">turns me and she says hey Dad I have a</text>
  <text start="359.67" dur="4.59">question for you and I said yeah manda</text>
  <text start="361.41" dur="6">what is it she goes how do you know you</text>
  <text start="364.26" dur="4.92">hear the voice of the Lord and you talk</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="5.36">about our neighbors not going to heaven</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="8.64">what do you mean by that now get this</text>
  <text start="372.77" dur="7.69">God has keys to your family all right if</text>
  <text start="377.82" dur="5.94">you ask him for the keys he&amp;#39;ll give you</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="5.67">a strategy to unlock their hearts and</text>
  <text start="383.76" dur="4.2">come into the kingdom if you try to do</text>
  <text start="386.13" dur="5.46">it by some program you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="387.96" dur="5.67">offend them only God knows the key to</text>
  <text start="391.59" dur="3.84">that person&amp;#39;s heart God is the only one</text>
  <text start="393.63" dur="3.81">knows the strategy to unlock that heart</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="5.75">we have got to become people that ask</text>
  <text start="397.44" dur="8.19">for his voice and that such</text>
  <text start="401.18" dur="7.24">okay another one is this there&amp;#39;s a there</text>
  <text start="405.63" dur="4.92">is a theology out there I&amp;#39;ve run into it</text>
  <text start="408.42" dur="3.98">periodically where we don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="410.55" dur="5.52">this idea that God wants to bless people</text>
  <text start="412.4" dur="5.68">okay when we minister to people out of</text>
  <text start="416.07" dur="4.38">Revelation please understand whether it</text>
  <text start="418.08" dur="6.78">has warnings behind it or whatever it is</text>
  <text start="420.45" dur="6.99">always finished off with I want to bless</text>
  <text start="424.86" dur="5.49">you I want to reveal my mercy to you and</text>
  <text start="427.44" dur="5.52">I am for you okay and so part of us</text>
  <text start="430.35" dur="4.23">hearing from the Lord is understanding</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="4.38">that the kingdom of God has to do with</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="4.32">the blessing of God okay and so when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="437.34" dur="3.12">before the Lord and God&amp;#39;s wanting to</text>
  <text start="438.9" dur="2.91">minister physical or emotional healing</text>
  <text start="440.46" dur="3.33">or he&amp;#39;s wanting to talk to him about</text>
  <text start="441.81" dur="4.17">their destiny I also stopped and I go</text>
  <text start="443.79" dur="4.95">now God how do you want to bless this</text>
  <text start="445.98" dur="6.57">person and God is willing to come and</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="6">speak a blessing a present blessing and</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="4.11">also let&amp;#39;s move that on to a future</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="5.31">blessing God wants to talk to people</text>
  <text start="456.66" dur="5.31">about their futures okay all right now</text>
  <text start="460.05" dur="3.9">let&amp;#39;s talk about flowing and revelation</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="4.5">turn with me to Matthew 7 7 and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.95" dur="5.49">look at this learning to flow and</text>
  <text start="466.47" dur="6.12">revelation now what I&amp;#39;m going to do is</text>
  <text start="469.44" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;m going to present this to you I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="472.59" dur="2.97">going to bring someone up out of the</text>
  <text start="473.88" dur="3.27">audience I&amp;#39;m going to pray for them show</text>
  <text start="475.56" dur="3.84">you how to do this and then you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="477.15" dur="4.41">to do it okay there&amp;#39;s nothing more</text>
  <text start="479.4" dur="3.93">boring to me than just listening to</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="3.42">someone talk for 20 hours at a time</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="3.36">giving you all this information and have</text>
  <text start="484.98" dur="4.98">nowhere to apply it are you guys in</text>
  <text start="486.69" dur="4.86">agreement with me on that and so this is</text>
  <text start="489.96" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re getting a you&amp;#39;re getting a crash</text>
  <text start="491.55" dur="3.84">course right now so i&amp;#39;m going to show</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="2.85">you talk to you about it i&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="495.39" dur="4.95">show you how to do it and then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="496.83" dur="6.54">going to do it okay all right matthew 7</text>
  <text start="500.34" dur="7.05">7 says this now remember the word ask</text>
  <text start="503.37" dur="5.91">seek and knock our continual verbs in</text>
  <text start="507.39" dur="3.42">the original language which means you</text>
  <text start="509.28" dur="2.79">don&amp;#39;t just ask once and if it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="510.81" dur="6.39">get answered that wasn&amp;#39;t God&amp;#39;s well the</text>
  <text start="512.07" dur="7.98">idea is not asking seeking knocking okay</text>
  <text start="517.2" dur="4.589">continually until God responds so it</text>
  <text start="520.05" dur="5.01">says as ask and it will be given to you</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="5.281">seek and you will find knock and the</text>
