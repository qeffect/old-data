  <text start="105.19" dur="4.65">you want to</text>
  <text start="105.79" dur="6">it goes like this I received a question</text>
  <text start="109.84" dur="3.96">from a friend who wanted to know how she</text>
  <text start="111.79" dur="4.56">could know for certain that what she was</text>
  <text start="113.8" dur="3.84">seeing or hearing was from God so here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="116.35" dur="3.48">my answer to this question</text>
  <text start="117.64" dur="3.51">no one should allow themselves to be</text>
  <text start="119.83" dur="3.48">tricked into thinking they&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="121.15" dur="3.51">from God when they&amp;#39;re not we need to</text>
  <text start="123.31" dur="3.66">know that we aren&amp;#39;t just imagining</text>
  <text start="124.66" dur="4.32">things well I think it&amp;#39;s impossible to</text>
  <text start="126.97" dur="3.6">know with 100% certainty that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="128.98" dur="3.69">hearing from God and not yourself I</text>
  <text start="130.57" dur="5.07">think we can achieve a high level of</text>
  <text start="132.67" dur="4.47">certainty part of what we deal with when</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="3.63">we doubt that we&amp;#39;re hearing from God is</text>
  <text start="137.14" dur="4.83">a bias in our mind that has been placed</text>
  <text start="139.27" dur="4.41">there by our educational system unless</text>
  <text start="141.97" dur="3.75">you attended a Christian school system</text>
  <text start="143.68" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s likely that your default way of</text>
  <text start="145.72" dur="4.32">thinking has been biased toward a</text>
  <text start="147.25" dur="4.53">philosophy of naturalism that is to say</text>
  <text start="150.04" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;ve been taught to think that God if</text>
  <text start="151.78" dur="4.89">he even exists rarely involves himself</text>
  <text start="154.15" dur="4.44">in the affairs of men he rarely speaks</text>
  <text start="156.67" dur="4.2">to us and if he does it&amp;#39;s with a loud</text>
  <text start="158.59" dur="5.04">booming voice that is so obvious it</text>
  <text start="160.87" dur="4.26">can&amp;#39;t be mistaken for anything else this</text>
  <text start="163.63" dur="4.32">is the way I was taught to think about</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="4.59">God this philosophy creates doubt in our</text>
  <text start="167.95" dur="4.2">mind that we can actually hear from a</text>
  <text start="169.72" dur="4.23">God the truth of the matter is quite</text>
  <text start="172.15" dur="3.75">different from this in the very</text>
  <text start="173.95" dur="3.66">beginning of time when God first spoken</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="4.05">to the emptiness and the creation came</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="4.62">forth the voice of God has never stopped</text>
  <text start="179.95" dur="3.96">speaking although some people find it</text>
  <text start="182.23" dur="4.17">hard to recognize God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="183.91" dur="5.22">he is always eternally speaking to his</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="4.89">creation the problem isn&amp;#39;t that God</text>
  <text start="189.13" dur="3.84">isn&amp;#39;t saying anything the problem is</text>
  <text start="191.29" dur="3.33">that our minds have been trained to</text>
  <text start="192.97" dur="4.53">misinterpret his voice as our own</text>
  <text start="194.62" dur="4.14">thoughts God communicates in a variety</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="3">of ways</text>
  <text start="198.76" dur="3.809">among other modes of communication he</text>
  <text start="200.5" dur="3.569">speaks to us through visions dreams and</text>
  <text start="202.569" dur="3.87">faint thought impressions they carry</text>
  <text start="204.069" dur="4.681">messages these things are at first</text>
  <text start="206.439" dur="4.711">difficult to discern it&amp;#39;s easy to</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="3.78">attribute them to our own minds but</text>
  <text start="211.15" dur="3.479">here&amp;#39;s the thing I noticed about God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="212.53" dur="5.25">visions and thoughts that allows me to</text>
  <text start="214.629" dur="4.591">distinguish them from my own I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="217.78" dur="3.78">travelling around the Sun for half a</text>
  <text start="219.22" dur="4.739">century and that time I&amp;#39;ve come to know</text>
  <text start="221.56" dur="4.289">my own way of thinking pretty well when</text>
  <text start="223.959" dur="4.11">someone quotes me on Facebook and I see</text>
  <text start="225.849" dur="4.711">it I recognize where the thought came</text>
  <text start="228.069" dur="4.26">from if someone copied and pasted one of</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="4.049">my articles on their Facebook page and I</text>
  <text start="232.329" dur="4.621">read it I would immediately recognize it</text>
  <text start="234.609" dur="4.141">his mind if someone posted one of my</text>
  <text start="236.95" dur="3.5">pencil drawings on their page I would</text>
  <text start="238.75" dur="3.81">spot it and know that it was mine I</text>
  <text start="240.45" dur="4.869">recognize my own thoughts when I hear</text>
  <text start="242.56" dur="4.789">them I recognize the creative visual</text>
  <text start="245.319" dur="4.29">material of my own mind when I see it</text>
  <text start="247.349" dur="5.521">when I hear a thought that is unfamiliar</text>
  <text start="249.609" dur="5.761">I also recognize it as not being from me</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="4.209">when I see a visual image that is</text>
  <text start="255.37" dur="5.76">foreign to my own creativity</text>
  <text start="257.079" dur="5.791">I recognize it as not mine God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="4.08">thoughts are much more sublime than my</text>
  <text start="262.87" dur="4.71">own thoughts they&amp;#39;re full of love full</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="4.92">of life full of wisdom full of</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="4.08">compassion and full of mercy my own</text>
  <text start="270.13" dur="3.84">thoughts do not have these qualities</text>
  <text start="271.66" dur="4.56">when I have a thought that oozes those</text>
  <text start="273.97" dur="4.919">qualities I know it did not come from me</text>
  <text start="276.22" dur="4.069">I know that every good and perfect thing</text>
  <text start="278.889" dur="5.28">comes down from the Father of lights</text>
  <text start="280.289" dur="6.581">James 1:17 so I know its source</text>
  <text start="284.169" dur="4.951">immediately the same is true for visual</text>
  <text start="286.87" dur="4.5">images God&amp;#39;s images are full of</text>
  <text start="289.12" dur="4.919">beautiful inexpressible colors textures</text>
  <text start="291.37" dur="5.519">patterns and light they are often very</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="5.551">unearthly in appearance not always but</text>
  <text start="296.889" dur="5.31">most of the time my mind doesn&amp;#39;t conjure</text>
  <text start="299.59" dur="6.18">up such images so again when I see these</text>
  <text start="302.199" dur="8.19">I know the source must I know the source</text>
  <text start="305.77" dur="6.03">can&amp;#39;t be me so it must be God half the</text>
  <text start="310.389" dur="3.721">Battle of knowing that what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="311.8" dur="4.26">seeing or hearing is from God is simply</text>
  <text start="314.11" dur="4.38">a matter of knowing that it isn&amp;#39;t from</text>
  <text start="316.06" dur="4.71">you the other part of the equation is</text>
  <text start="318.49" dur="4.47">faith well it would be great to know</text>
  <text start="320.77" dur="3.84">with absolute certainty that what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="322.96" dur="3.81">seeing or hearing is from God his</text>
  <text start="324.61" dur="4.89">kingdom doesn&amp;#39;t work that way everything</text>
  <text start="326.77" dur="5.3">we do in the kingdom is done by faith we</text>
  <text start="329.5" dur="5.36">prophesy by faith we heal by faith</text>
  <text start="332.07" dur="4.35">we raise the dead by faith faith is</text>
  <text start="334.86" dur="3.84">trusting that the revelation we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="336.42" dur="4.23">receiving is from God not knowing for</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="2.67">sure it&amp;#39;s from him but trusting that</text>
  <text start="340.65" dur="2.73">it&amp;#39;s from him</text>
  <text start="341.37" dur="4.41">the more you prophesied the more your</text>
  <text start="343.38" dur="4.02">faith for prophecy grows the more you</text>
  <text start="345.78" dur="4.38">heal the more your faith for healing</text>
  <text start="347.4" dur="4.29">grows the more you walk on water the</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="4.8">more your faith for walking on water</text>
  <text start="351.69" dur="4.74">grows the confirmation that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="354.96" dur="3.69">hearing God accurately is when you</text>
  <text start="356.43" dur="4.05">examine the fruit of it you get an</text>
  <text start="358.65" dur="3.66">impression that a stranger has back pain</text>
  <text start="360.48" dur="4.17">and you ask them about it and they</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="4.26">confirm that they do have back pain the</text>
  <text start="364.65" dur="4.53">revelation is confirmed you&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="4.05">from God you might get an impression</text>
  <text start="369.18" dur="2.76">that you should enter a store and speak</text>
  <text start="370.62" dur="4.53">to the person working behind the counter</text>
  <text start="371.94" dur="5.04">about a death in their family if you go</text>
  <text start="375.15" dur="3.24">in and talk with them and learn that</text>
  <text start="376.98" dur="3.69">their mother just passed away and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="378.39" dur="5.55">able to comfort them the revelation is</text>
  <text start="380.67" dur="5.19">confirmed you&amp;#39;re hearing from God as we</text>
  <text start="383.94" dur="3.9">obeyed the revelation we receive and it</text>
  <text start="385.86" dur="4.23">produces fruit we grow in confidence</text>
