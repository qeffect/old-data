  <text start="188.26" dur="5.61">from February 22nd actually this is a</text>
  <text start="190.42" dur="5.28">post that I missed in my last update and</text>
  <text start="193.87" dur="5.24">somebody sent me an email about it</text>
  <text start="195.7" dur="5.46">wanted to know what my take on it was</text>
  <text start="199.11" dur="3.939">this particular post I&amp;#39;m just going to</text>
  <text start="201.16" dur="5.43">read it for you they want you divided</text>
  <text start="203.049" dur="8.19">how can some be so blind help them wake</text>
  <text start="206.59" dur="5.07">up estimated 20 mm reached question</text>
  <text start="211.239" dur="3.421">everything</text>
  <text start="211.66" dur="5.46">keep talking stand up fight fight fight</text>
  <text start="214.66" dur="4.109">how do they control children what</text>
  <text start="217.12" dur="6.03">prevents a child from revealing the</text>
  <text start="218.769" dur="6.631">truth so pretty self-explanatory Q has</text>
  <text start="223.15" dur="3.99">often said that the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="225.4" dur="3.48">the puppet masters want us divided</text>
  <text start="227.14" dur="5.099">that&amp;#39;s why they create these false Flags</text>
  <text start="228.88" dur="6.3">they get us split up and arguing about</text>
  <text start="232.239" dur="4.861">different things Q I think is saying</text>
  <text start="235.18" dur="4.79">that they&amp;#39;ve estimate they&amp;#39;ve reached 20</text>
  <text start="237.1" dur="5.79">million people with the message so far</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="3.91">with what we know about the CIA and</text>
  <text start="242.89" dur="2.4">their involvement we&amp;#39;re going to find</text>
  <text start="243.88" dur="3.51">out a lot more about that here in just a</text>
  <text start="245.29" dur="5.97">few minutes we need to start questioning</text>
  <text start="247.39" dur="6.48">what we&amp;#39;ve been told how do they control</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="6.21">children well one way to control</text>
  <text start="253.87" dur="5.7">children is fear what prevents a child</text>
  <text start="257.47" dur="4.89">from revealing the truth well they have</text>
  <text start="259.57" dur="4.99">courage and if they boldness and if they</text>
  <text start="262.36" dur="5.35">know the truth they can tell the truth</text>
  <text start="264.56" dur="5.25">I think that is going to become a more</text>
  <text start="267.71" dur="5.28">important issue here in the next few</text>
  <text start="269.81" dur="6.39">weeks so I&amp;#39;ll move on to and like I said</text>

  <text start="304.07" dur="5.09">from the post that I missed last week</text>

  <text start="1003.99" dur="7.23">would like I follow this account on</text>

  <text start="1039" dur="11.96">flag this is a Wikipedia link and this</text>
  <text start="1048.06" dur="5.97">is the first part of the Wikipedia entry</text>
  <text start="1050.96" dur="4.84">so a false flag refers to covert</text>
  <text start="1054.03" dur="4.32">operations that are designed to deceive</text>
  <text start="1055.8" dur="4.69">the deception creates the appearance of</text>

  <text start="1060.49" dur="4.47">being responsible for some activity</text>
  <text start="1062.799" dur="5.731">disguising the actual source of</text>

  <text start="1090.539" dur="4.87">my answer is false flags are intended to</text>
  <text start="1094.39" dur="4.019">change a news cycle</text>

  <text start="1897.12" dur="4.47">information he sent me this link which</text>
  <text start="1899.61" dur="4.76">takes you to a website and describes the</text>
  <text start="1901.59" dur="7.05">organizational structure inside the NSA</text>
  <text start="1904.37" dur="7.24">which for years was kept secret NSA and</text>
  <text start="1908.64" dur="4.59">a lot of these agencies they exist for a</text>
  <text start="1911.61" dur="3.12">long time before anyone officially</text>
  <text start="1913.23" dur="3.03">acknowledges them before Congress</text>
  <text start="1914.73" dur="4.71">acknowledges them before we know they</text>
  <text start="1916.26" dur="5.22">even exist and I&amp;#39;ll tell you more about</text>
  <text start="1919.44" dur="6.27">that in a few minutes but let me go to</text>
  <text start="1921.48" dur="7.949">this website and we are going to look</text>
  <text start="1925.71" dur="9.23">around a little bit this is electro</text>
  <text start="1929.429" dur="10.261">spaces net and this particular page is</text>
  <text start="1934.94" dur="7.359">NSA&amp;#39;s organizational designations so</text>
  <text start="1939.69" dur="4.229">it&amp;#39;s broken down into sections or</text>
  <text start="1942.299" dur="3.991">directorates if you want signals</text>
  <text start="1943.919" dur="6.931">intelligence communications security top</text>
  <text start="1946.29" dur="8.42">level communications and down here there</text>
  <text start="1950.85" dur="8.79">is the Directorate designated by letters</text>
  <text start="1954.71" dur="9.099">so the letter D corresponds to the</text>
  <text start="1959.64" dur="7.83">office of the director of the NSA the</text>
  <text start="1963.809" dur="5.821">letter e corresponds to the education</text>
  <text start="1967.47" dur="5.55">sector of the NSA that is if you click</text>
  <text start="1969.63" dur="6.27">on that it takes you down here so</text>
  <text start="1973.02" dur="8.58">there&amp;#39;s an F which is the field sites</text>
  <text start="1975.9" dur="7.74">there is a there&amp;#39;s an AI which is</text>
  <text start="1981.6" dur="5.1">information assurance Directorate</text>
  <text start="1983.64" dur="5.94">all right so each Directorate in the NSA</text>
  <text start="1986.7" dur="5.4">has a letter and the directory that</text>
  <text start="1989.58" dur="5.4">corresponds to it and there is a queue</text>
  <text start="1992.1" dur="5.43">so if you click on the queue it takes</text>
  <text start="1994.98" dur="5.19">you to the Associate Director for</text>
  <text start="1997.53" dur="7.35">security and counterintelligence or the</text>
  <text start="2000.17" dur="8.67">80s and see I asked you zero is staff</text>
  <text start="2004.88" dur="9.42">and then if you there is a hierarchy</text>
  <text start="2008.84" dur="8.94">here so q0 v security ops center zero</text>
  <text start="2014.3" dur="5.76">seven zero nine q1 and then their office</text>
  <text start="2017.78" dur="5.01">of physical security q one two three</text>
  <text start="2020.06" dur="7.17">so you see this hierarchy just goes down</text>
  <text start="2022.79" dur="6.78">and this office the Directorate for</text>
  <text start="2027.23" dur="6.5">security and counterintelligence is the</text>
  <text start="2029.57" dur="7.43">NSA&amp;#39;s police force they have their own</text>
  <text start="2033.73" dur="5.71">law enforcement agency that does</text>
  <text start="2037" dur="4.54">investigations and prosecutes or</text>
  <text start="2039.44" dur="5.81">recommends prosecution of criminal</text>
  <text start="2041.54" dur="10.26">activity this is the Q Directorate</text>
  <text start="2045.25" dur="8.2">inside the NSA and I am wondering after</text>
  <text start="2051.8" dur="5.58">I saw this and a bunch of us are</text>
  <text start="2053.45" dur="6.42">wondering is Q actually a member of the</text>
  <text start="2057.38" dur="5.31">Q Directorate because a lot of the stuff</text>
  <text start="2059.87" dur="5.73">that Q posts seems to come out of the</text>
  <text start="2062.69" dur="7.11">NSA and I&amp;#39;ll give you some more</text>
  <text start="2065.6" dur="8.58">information on that go back here so this</text>
  <text start="2069.8" dur="7.47">is an article and it is about the Q</text>
  <text start="2074.18" dur="5.13">group and the Directorate of the NSA</text>
  <text start="2077.27" dur="3.69">that is hunting down Edward Snowden and</text>
  <text start="2079.31" dur="7.53">we click on this link and we&amp;#39;ll take you</text>
  <text start="2080.96" dur="10.97">to the article so yes this article is</text>
  <text start="2086.84" dur="13.08">actually from 2000 it&amp;#39;s by Eli Lake and</text>
  <text start="2091.93" dur="12.04">it&amp;#39;s the timeline is 1244 june 10th of</text>
  <text start="2099.92" dur="7.29">2013 this is when the NSA was looking</text>
  <text start="2103.97" dur="5.7">for Edward Snowden and if you read this</text>
  <text start="2107.21" dur="5.37">article it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting but it</text>
  <text start="2109.67" dur="8">talks about this Directorate inside the</text>
  <text start="2112.58" dur="7.88">NSA that is called the Q Group</text>
  <text start="2117.67" dur="4.98">and they have been tracking Snowden and</text>
  <text start="2120.46" dur="3.78">trying to get him and then from Hong</text>
  <text start="2122.65" dur="7.379">Kong and all the places gone to in</text>
  <text start="2124.24" dur="8.43">Russia so there is evidently aq group</text>
  <text start="2130.029" dur="7.02">inside the NSA that is going after</text>
  <text start="2132.67" dur="8.129">Snowden and since so much of what Q</text>
  <text start="2137.049" dur="6.78">posts about is about Snowden that gives</text>
  <text start="2140.799" dur="6.77">me further reason to wonder if Q isn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="2143.829" dur="6.361">part of the Q Directorate at the NSA so</text>
  <text start="2147.569" dur="6.28">for those of you who are asking who I</text>
  <text start="2150.19" dur="6.359">think Q is if it was if I had to you</text>
  <text start="2153.849" dur="4.77">know make a bet I would say Q is in that</text>
  <text start="2156.549" dur="4.831">group and let me just give you a couple</text>
  <text start="2158.619" dur="8.49">of things to think about here this was a</text>
  <text start="2161.38" dur="8.1">post from February 16th and it involves</text>
  <text start="2167.109" dur="5.581">you know Q is saying hey in the UK stay</text>
  <text start="2169.48" dur="7.47">alert and this is a picture it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2172.69" dur="7.379">street cam but notice the tag up here is</text>
  <text start="2176.95" dur="5.76">NSA traffic cam and I&amp;#39;ve noticed that</text>
  <text start="2180.069" dur="5.46">quite a few of Q&amp;#39;s posts seemed to come</text>
  <text start="2182.71" dur="4.559">from NSA sources that is another reason</text>
  <text start="2185.529" dur="5.121">why I suspect that you know if I had to</text>
  <text start="2187.269" dur="9.26">go and try to say who Q is I would say</text>
  <text start="2190.65" dur="9.879">it might be somebody in the NSA alright</text>
  <text start="2196.529" dur="6.73">and again let me make this clear I am</text>
  <text start="2200.529" dur="4.951">NOT saying that we&amp;#39;ve discovered where Q</text>
  <text start="2203.259" dur="5.03">works and his team works or who Q is I</text>
  <text start="2205.48" dur="5.549">just find this stuff kind of interesting</text>
  <text start="2208.289" dur="6.04">my focus is not on trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="2211.029" dur="6.84">who Q is my focus is on taking the</text>

  <text start="2320.9" dur="4.38">at least in the last month you really</text>
  <text start="2323.36" dur="5.67">have to understand what Snowden&amp;#39;s part</text>
  <text start="2325.28" dur="4.5">is and all of this so first part of the</text>
  <text start="2329.03" dur="3.62">CIA</text>
  <text start="2329.78" dur="8.55">Snowden&amp;#39;s operation consisted of one</text>

  <text start="2348.23" dur="3.09">all of this if you&amp;#39;re a I would</text>

  <text start="2361.33" dur="8.92">is actually it&amp;#39;s an excerpt from a book</text>
  <text start="2363.95" dur="8.61">and the author is Luke Harding he wrote</text>
  <text start="2370.25" dur="3.96">a book on Snowden and this article is</text>
  <text start="2372.56" dur="5.13">titled how Edward Snowden went from a</text>

  <text start="2377.69" dur="4.08">you want to understand what happened</text>
  <text start="2379.16" dur="3.82">with Snowden read this article it is</text>
  <text start="2381.77" dur="5.319">very good</text>
  <text start="2382.98" dur="7.56">it explains you know what Snowden did as</text>
  <text start="2387.089" dur="6.51">a teenager how he was online geeking out</text>
  <text start="2390.54" dur="7.069">on different internet chat boards as the</text>
  <text start="2393.599" dur="7.02">true hoo-hah his life in the early 20s</text>
  <text start="2397.609" dur="4.181">his when he got into the military why he</text>
  <text start="2400.619" dur="6.691">got out of the military and when he got</text>
  <text start="2401.79" dur="8.24">injured his conservative views some of</text>
  <text start="2407.31" dur="5.76">his boasting and different things and</text>
  <text start="2410.03" dur="6.25">then you know going to Maryland</text>
  <text start="2413.07" dur="7.71">getting a job an IT working for the CIA</text>
  <text start="2416.28" dur="8.49">and then transferring over to the NSA it</text>
  <text start="2420.78" dur="7.5">talks about his first job at NSA as a in</text>
  <text start="2424.77" dur="5.76">the cryptological Center in Hawaii he</text>
  <text start="2428.28" dur="5.819">also worked overseas I think</text>
  <text start="2430.53" dur="6.839">and I remember if it was Japan that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2434.099" dur="5.371">right he left Japan in 2012 so this</text>
  <text start="2437.369" dur="5.941">article gives a really good timeline of</text>
  <text start="2439.47" dur="9.96">where he went what he did the the big</text>
  <text start="2443.31" dur="10.74">deal was Snowden was when he moved to a</text>
  <text start="2449.43" dur="6.659">different job inside the NSA and let me</text>
  <text start="2454.05" dur="5.13">zoom this in you can see a little bit</text>
  <text start="2456.089" dur="5.161">better we don&amp;#39;t know exactly how he</text>
  <text start="2459.18" dur="3.96">harvested the material but it appears</text>
  <text start="2461.25" dur="4.859">Snowden downloaded NSA documents onto</text>
  <text start="2463.14" dur="5.76">thumbnail drives thumb drives are</text>
  <text start="2466.109" dur="5.311">forbidden to mos def but a sis at men</text>
  <text start="2468.9" dur="4.65">system administrator could argue that he</text>
  <text start="2471.42" dur="5.28">or she was repairing a corrupted user</text>
  <text start="2473.55" dur="5.19">file and needed to a backup so sitting</text>
  <text start="2476.7" dur="4.919">in Hawaii Snowden could remove remotely</text>
  <text start="2478.74" dur="4.47">reach into the NSA&amp;#39;s servers most staff</text>
  <text start="2481.619" dur="4.671">had already gone home for the night</text>
  <text start="2483.21" dur="6.119">before he logged on six time zones away</text>
  <text start="2486.29" dur="5.2">after four weeks in his new job Snowden</text>
  <text start="2489.329" dur="4.351">told his bosses at Booz Allen that he</text>
  <text start="2491.49" dur="4.41">was unwell he wanted some time off</text>
  <text start="2493.68" dur="5.13">requested unpaid leave when they checked</text>
  <text start="2495.9" dur="7.62">back with them he said he had epilepsy</text>
  <text start="2498.81" dur="7.68">so he gained access to the NSA&amp;#39;s servers</text>
  <text start="2503.52" dur="5.52">and was able to use a thumb drive to</text>
  <text start="2506.49" dur="5.129">download files which is really strictly</text>
  <text start="2509.04" dur="5.16">forbidden but in his position he was</text>
  <text start="2511.619" dur="5.671">able to justify it and that is how he</text>
  <text start="2514.2" dur="5.67">gained access so when Q says</text>
  <text start="2517.29" dur="3.27">centralize gain access without being</text>
  <text start="2519.87" dur="2.67">detected</text>
  <text start="2520.56" dur="4.68">he was able to get in there get access</text>
  <text start="2522.54" dur="5.37">to files download them and and as assist</text>
  <text start="2525.24" dur="5.64">admin there&amp;#39;s really no way to track who</text>
  <text start="2527.91" dur="4.68">it was it did that so that&amp;#39;s how he got</text>
  <text start="2530.88" dur="4.37">through the system got the information</text>
  <text start="2532.59" dur="8.31">out without being detected</text>
  <text start="2535.25" dur="8.41">all right so Hugh posted the next thing</text>
  <text start="2540.9" dur="5.25">in this long chain was date Snowden</text>
  <text start="2543.66" dur="6.84">first made contact with Glenn Greenwald</text>
  <text start="2546.15" dur="5.97">and Laura Poitras in April of 2013 he</text>
  <text start="2550.5" dur="4.47">gave them sample documents that he had</text>
  <text start="2552.12" dur="4.62">downloaded just to prove his identity</text>
  <text start="2554.97" dur="2.43">and who he was they didn&amp;#39;t know who he</text>
  <text start="2556.74" dur="3.51">was</text>
  <text start="2557.4" dur="5.88">Snowden actually portrayed himself as a</text>
  <text start="2560.25" dur="5.52">senior analyst to the NSA so they were</text>
  <text start="2563.28" dur="5.79">expecting some guy in you know 40s or</text>
  <text start="2565.77" dur="4.08">50s probably who had been in the agency</text>
  <text start="2569.07" dur="3.74">a long time</text>
  <text start="2569.85" dur="5.37">they chatted via secure Channel Snowden</text>
  <text start="2572.81" dur="5.89">invited them to go to Hong Kong and the</text>
  <text start="2575.22" dur="6.12">article says that Greenwald had a</text>
  <text start="2578.7" dur="6.72">meeting with the Guardians staff on the</text>
  <text start="2581.34" dur="7.65">May 31st they talked about it he got the</text>
  <text start="2585.42" dur="5.55">green light from his higher-ups and then</text>
  <text start="2588.99" dur="5.85">they flew there the next day so far as I</text>
  <text start="2590.97" dur="8.4">know they floated on June 1st Business</text>
  <text start="2594.84" dur="7.59">Insider has a timeline of all of the</text>
  <text start="2599.37" dur="4.77">known Snowden leaks concerning the NSA</text>
  <text start="2602.43" dur="4.29">and actually a lot of the information</text>
  <text start="2604.14" dur="6.77">has to do with British intelligence</text>
  <text start="2606.72" dur="7.02">GCHQ this is an excellent article I</text>
  <text start="2610.91" dur="6.43">would definitely recommend checking it</text>
  <text start="2613.74" dur="6.51">out if you don&amp;#39;t know much about Snowden</text>
  <text start="2617.34" dur="5.34">and his leaks there&amp;#39;s some good</text>
  <text start="2620.25" dur="4.41">background information here and then it</text>

  <text start="3002.28" dur="3.99">there are a couple of things that I</text>
  <text start="3003.66" dur="5.22">think are worth noting and let me show</text>
  <text start="3006.27" dur="6.63">you what they&amp;#39;re so here&amp;#39;s an excerpt</text>
  <text start="3008.88" dur="5.61">from the article and it may be what he</text>
  <text start="3012.9" dur="4.74">was referring to as a presidential</text>
  <text start="3014.49" dur="5.28">directive President Obama went through</text>
  <text start="3017.64" dur="3.929">and talked about the issues with</text>
  <text start="3019.77" dur="6.18">security and problems that had come up</text>
  <text start="3021.569" dur="5.73">and now he&amp;#39;s proposing his Corrections</text>
  <text start="3025.95" dur="2.78">he outlines I think four different</text>
  <text start="3027.299" dur="4.711">things he&amp;#39;s gonna make it</text>
  <text start="3028.73" dur="6.819">propose to correct the problems and</text>
  <text start="3032.01" dur="5.18">deficiencies were found first I have</text>
  <text start="3035.549" dur="4.26">approved a new presidential directive</text>
  <text start="3037.19" dur="4.69">for signals intelligence activities both</text>
  <text start="3039.809" dur="3.661">at home and abroad this guidance will</text>
  <text start="3041.88" dur="3.959">strengthen an executive branch oversight</text>
  <text start="3043.47" dur="4.259">of our intelligence activities</text>
  <text start="3045.839" dur="3.811">it will ensure that we make take into</text>
  <text start="3047.729" dur="4.201">account our security requirements but</text>
  <text start="3049.65" dur="4.29">also our alliances our trade and</text>
  <text start="3051.93" dur="4.289">investment relationships including the</text>
  <text start="3053.94" dur="3.779">concerns of American companies and our</text>
  <text start="3056.219" dur="3.54">commitment to privacy and basic</text>
  <text start="3057.719" dur="3.421">liberties and we will review decisions</text>
  <text start="3059.759" dur="3.72">about intelligence priorities and</text>
  <text start="3061.14" dur="4.139">sensitive targets on an annual basis so</text>
  <text start="3063.479" dur="4.62">that our actions are regularly</text>
  <text start="3065.279" dur="8.101">scrutinized by my senior national</text>
  <text start="3068.099" dur="7.98">security team so that is a presidential</text>
  <text start="3073.38" dur="5.239">directive which is one of the things in</text>
  <text start="3076.079" dur="5">u.s. is to look for and the date was</text>
  <text start="3078.619" dur="5.291">January 17 2014</text>
  <text start="3081.079" dur="4.03">so again you know I said you can read</text>
  <text start="3083.91" dur="3.53">this article gives you a lot of</text>
  <text start="3085.109" dur="5.15">information just hitting highlights here</text>
  <text start="3087.44" dur="5.289">President Obama created a review group</text>
  <text start="3090.259" dur="7.09">probably some of his friends and</text>
  <text start="3092.729" dur="7.08">insiders who determined that well the</text>
  <text start="3097.349" dur="5.67">review group turned up no indication</text>
  <text start="3099.809" dur="5.371">that the NSA database had been</text>
  <text start="3103.019" dur="4.47">intentionally abused and I believe it is</text>
  <text start="3105.18" dur="5.21">important that the capability that this</text>
  <text start="3107.489" dur="6.901">program is designed to meet is preserved</text>
  <text start="3110.39" dur="7.3">so Obama in this speech is trying to</text>
  <text start="3114.39" dur="5.49">reassure people that there is no abuse</text>
  <text start="3117.69" dur="3.539">of the NSA database that everything is</text>
  <text start="3119.88" dur="7.32">hunky-dory we have nothing to worry</text>
  <text start="3121.229" dur="8.671">about except things like this so if</text>
  <text start="3127.2" dur="4.68">you&amp;#39;ve been following conservative</text>
  <text start="3129.9" dur="5.369">Treehouse Sundance you&amp;#39;re familiar with</text>
  <text start="3131.88" dur="6.78">this document probably this is one of</text>
  <text start="3135.269" dur="6.57">the documents that came out of the FISA</text>
  <text start="3138.66" dur="8.419">Court ruling a couple years ago it was</text>
  <text start="3141.839" dur="10.14">actually this document came out in 2016</text>
  <text start="3147.079" dur="9">it was Declassified in 2017 and it talks</text>
  <text start="3151.979" dur="7.08">about the FBI allowing private</text>
  <text start="3156.079" dur="8.071">contractors to access raw FISA</text>
  <text start="3159.059" dur="5.091">information on FBI storage systems</text>
  <text start="3164.239" dur="8.08">without having proper clearance or using</text>
  <text start="3170.099" dur="6.061">minimization procedures and training and</text>
  <text start="3172.319" dur="5.271">the NSA found sorry the FISA Court found</text>
  <text start="3176.16" dur="4.67">that this</text>
  <text start="3177.59" dur="4.59">had been going on for multiple years and</text>
  <text start="3180.83" dur="6.26">this is not something that just popped</text>
  <text start="3182.18" dur="7.44">up on the radar and that&amp;#39;s what the big</text>
  <text start="3187.09" dur="8.2">controversy was about with renew all of</text>
  <text start="3189.62" dur="8.22">FISA 702 this year so third President</text>
  <text start="3195.29" dur="4.32">Obama says and it&amp;#39;s gonna read this</text>
  <text start="3197.84" dur="3.42">third we will provide additional</text>
  <text start="3199.61" dur="5.91">protections for activities conducted</text>
  <text start="3201.26" dur="5.49">under section 702 of FISA which allows</text>
  <text start="3205.52" dur="3">the government to intercept the</text>
  <text start="3206.75" dur="3.99">communications of foreign targets</text>
  <text start="3208.52" dur="3.92">overseas who have information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3210.74" dur="3.54">important for our national security</text>
  <text start="3212.44" dur="3.34">specifically I&amp;#39;m asking the Attorney</text>
  <text start="3214.28" dur="4.05">General and Director of National</text>
  <text start="3215.78" dur="4.11">Intelligence to institute reforms that</text>
  <text start="3218.33" dur="3.69">place additional restrictions on</text>
  <text start="3219.89" dur="4.95">government&amp;#39;s ability to retain search</text>
  <text start="3222.02" dur="4.52">and use in criminal cases communications</text>
  <text start="3224.84" dur="4.65">between American and foreign citizens</text>
  <text start="3226.54" dur="6.1">incidentally collected under 702</text>
  <text start="3229.49" dur="5.84">so here Obama is telling us that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3232.64" dur="6.75">going to place further restrictions on</text>
  <text start="3235.33" dur="6.97">702 so it can&amp;#39;t be abused and what</text>
  <text start="3239.39" dur="6.87">happens in the following two or three</text>
  <text start="3242.3" dur="6.27">years we have been learning that Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3246.26" dur="7.73">senior staff Security Council people</text>

  <text start="5607.6" dur="8.91">going probably somewhere in China and</text>

  <text start="5658.82" dur="4.14">confusion about net neutrality it sounds</text>
  <text start="5661.4" dur="2.88">like a great thing it sounds like</text>
  <text start="5662.96" dur="3.39">something we should do everyone should</text>
  <text start="5664.28" dur="4.65">be in favor of net neutrality right well</text>
  <text start="5666.35" dur="5.4">the problem with net neutrality is that</text>
  <text start="5668.93" dur="4.98">this is actually kind of a misnomer what</text>
  <text start="5671.75" dur="4.47">it is really is government control of</text>
  <text start="5673.91" dur="5.97">the Internet the government through a</text>
  <text start="5676.22" dur="6.86">net neutrality took control of the</text>
  <text start="5679.88" dur="5.52">internet and tried to regulate it and</text>
  <text start="5683.08" dur="4.87">the argument that government makes is</text>
  <text start="5685.4" dur="3.9">well you know internet providers can</text>
  <text start="5687.95" dur="2.19">throttle people and cut back their</text>
  <text start="5689.3" dur="3.06">internet speeds</text>
  <text start="5690.14" dur="5.97">you know unfairly and so we need to</text>
  <text start="5692.36" dur="6.5">control that well what it really is is</text>
  <text start="5696.11" dur="5.43">about giving more power and control to</text>
  <text start="5698.86" dur="8.02">bureaucrats corporatists and lobbyists</text>
  <text start="5701.54" dur="7.5">and it is it&amp;#39;s my belief that the free</text>
  <text start="5706.88" dur="4.38">market should control the internet that</text>
  <text start="5709.04" dur="4.92">if you know and we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the</text>
  <text start="5711.26" dur="5.73">past we&amp;#39;ve seen how the internet will</text>
  <text start="5713.96" dur="5.06">control itself and police itself the</text>
  <text start="5716.99" dur="6.78">free market system works</text>
  <text start="5719.02" dur="6.94">that I used previously is when cellphone</text>
  <text start="5723.77" dur="4.98">providers started getting competitive</text>
  <text start="5725.96" dur="7.35">with their rate plans and their data</text>
  <text start="5728.75" dur="7.95">plans my company t-mobile</text>
  <text start="5733.31" dur="5.49">was I think fourth of all the American</text>
  <text start="5736.7" dur="4.77">internet providers or cell phone</text>
  <text start="5738.8" dur="4.59">providers and when they got rid of their</text>
  <text start="5741.47" dur="4.65">two-year mandatory two-year contracts</text>
  <text start="5743.39" dur="5.82">and came out with a flat rate $50 a</text>
  <text start="5746.12" dur="7.23">month unlimited data unlimited text it</text>
  <text start="5749.21" dur="6.75">gave them a leg up and they leapfrog and</text>
  <text start="5753.35" dur="5.91">took over third place in the market for</text>
  <text start="5755.96" dur="5.45">cell phone providers and it was because</text>
  <text start="5759.26" dur="6.69">of competition and they forced other</text>
  <text start="5761.41" dur="7.21">cell phone providers to drop their rates</text>
  <text start="5765.95" dur="4.8">- some of them get rid of contracts and</text>
  <text start="5768.62" dur="5.25">it made it more competitive and the</text>
  <text start="5770.75" dur="7.58">providers actually had gave consumers</text>
  <text start="5773.87" dur="7.73">more data better service for less money</text>
  <text start="5778.33" dur="6.69">and to me those are the kind of forces</text>
  <text start="5781.6" dur="4.71">market forces actually work in creating</text>
  <text start="5785.02" dur="2.88">a level playing field its</text>
  <text start="5786.31" dur="6.93">competitiveness we don&amp;#39;t need government</text>
  <text start="5787.9" dur="7.71">to regulate that and Q has been warning</text>
  <text start="5793.24" dur="4.44">us that net neutrality is not what</text>
  <text start="5795.61" dur="3.96">people think it is and that an internet</text>
  <text start="5797.68" dur="4.23">bill of rights is what we really need so</text>

  <text start="5922.91" dur="4.83">from someone and I believe he had help</text>
  <text start="5924.35" dur="6.33">from the CIA he stopped in Hong Kong</text>
  <text start="5927.74" dur="6.81">because Hong Kong the People&amp;#39;s Republic</text>
  <text start="5930.68" dur="6.63">of China is probably sympathetic or</text>
  <text start="5934.55" dur="4.56">maybe they had some CIA assets in the</text>
  <text start="5937.31" dur="3.24">area who protected him</text>
  <text start="5939.11" dur="5.43">the interesting thing again about</text>
  <text start="5940.55" dur="6.93">Snowden is he stopped in Hong Kong use</text>
  <text start="5944.54" dur="4.35">his own name to get his hotel room used</text>
