  <text start="190.31" dur="3.84">the New York Times last night on their</text>
  <text start="191.75" dur="5.25">business page so China is now a little</text>
  <text start="194.15" dur="4.86">worried we had news yesterday that Apple</text>
  <text start="197" dur="4.05">is going to repatriate 200 billion</text>
  <text start="199.01" dur="3.509">dollars they&amp;#39;re bringing it back from</text>

  <text start="202.519" dur="6.411">into circulation here in the States</text>
  <text start="205.13" dur="6.03">at a low Inc tax rate well China is now</text>
  <text start="208.93" dur="4.12">realizing oh gosh we could lose a whole</text>
  <text start="211.16" dur="3.9">bunch of money they could go back to the</text>
  <text start="213.05" dur="3.99">States so China is not trying to change</text>
  <text start="215.06" dur="5.88">it&amp;#39;s a temporary thing where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="217.04" dur="6.44">going to allow you to avoid paying taxes</text>
  <text start="220.94" dur="6.99">on it temporarily if you leave it there</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="7.33">so the tax reform thing is is big it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.93" dur="5.43">having an effect around the world the UN</text>
  <text start="230.81" dur="5.25">is having an emergency Security Council</text>
  <text start="233.36" dur="5.49">meeting right now and I was just on</text>
  <text start="236.06" dur="5.97">Twitter I saw Nicola nikki Haley made a</text>
  <text start="238.85" dur="6">statement in front of the UN and this is</text>
  <text start="242.03" dur="5.19">what she&amp;#39;s saying and the Security</text>
  <text start="244.85" dur="3.54">Council meeting is to try to figure out</text>
  <text start="247.22" dur="4.799">what they&amp;#39;re gonna do about the Iranian</text>
  <text start="248.39" dur="6.21">protests 22 people have died so far a</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="4.171">thousand people have been arrested so</text>
  <text start="254.6" dur="4.139">this is what nikki Haley said and this</text>
  <text start="256.19" dur="3.75">is consistent with what she and the</text>
  <text start="258.739" dur="3.99">president and vice president have said</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="4.86">she said in the end the Iranian people</text>
  <text start="262.729" dur="4.261">will determine their own destiny let</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="4.86">there be no doubt the US stands</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="5.07">ethically with those in Iran who seek</text>
  <text start="269.66" dur="4.14">freedom for themselves prosperity for</text>

  <text start="273.8" dur="6">nation we will not be silent</text>
  <text start="275.9" dur="5.579">so nikki Haley is going to bat and I</text>
  <text start="279.8" dur="4.26">really like the job that nikki Haley is</text>
  <text start="281.479" dur="5.431">doing in the UN she represents us well a</text>
  <text start="284.06" dur="4.8">lot of people were skeptical of nikki</text>
  <text start="286.91" dur="4.83">Haley when she got appointed as UN</text>
  <text start="288.86" dur="7.95">Ambassador but she has proved to be a</text>
  <text start="291.74" dur="7.25">gem switching to news in the US the</text>
  <text start="296.81" dur="4.8">Department of Justice has announced and</text>

  <text start="303.699" dur="4.481">over pay-for-play</text>

  <text start="444.439" dur="7.59">him to be there this is a breaking news</text>
  <text start="448.879" dur="6.391">story and it is an unconfirmed news</text>
  <text start="452.029" dur="5.121">story and I&amp;#39;m not reporting this as a</text>
  <text start="455.27" dur="4.56">scoop</text>
  <text start="457.15" dur="5.379">Ellen Nakashima who is a national</text>
  <text start="459.83" dur="5.549">security porter with the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="462.529" dur="4.711">has an unconfirmed report that Admiral</text>
  <text start="465.379" dur="5.25">Rogers will be stepping down this spring</text>
  <text start="467.24" dur="8.01">from his role as a head of national</text>
  <text start="470.629" dur="6.69">security agency and I say now like I</text>

  <text start="483.319" dur="5.16">that he is going to be stepping down</text>
  <text start="485.449" dur="5.49">this spring and that he expects Trump to</text>
  <text start="488.479" dur="6.541">appoint a successor who will be</text>
  <text start="490.939" dur="6.48">confirmed by the Senate as soon as</text>
  <text start="495.02" dur="4.829">possible before you get excited about</text>
  <text start="497.419" dur="5.37">saying that general Flynn may be the</text>
  <text start="499.849" dur="4.41">next head of NSA it is very doubtful</text>
  <text start="502.789" dur="4.771">that general Flynn would make it through</text>
  <text start="504.259" dur="5.041">Senate confirmation so again this is</text>
  <text start="507.56" dur="5.13">unconcerned don&amp;#39;t know this to be true</text>
  <text start="509.3" dur="6.419">it is it is it is Washington Post and it</text>

  <text start="533.54" dur="7.59">is this is a big story and it is being</text>
  <text start="539.87" dur="5.99">overlooked by the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="541.13" dur="8.6">however I am going to focus on this so</text>
  <text start="545.86" dur="9.45">Attorney General Jeff Sessions is</text>
  <text start="549.73" dur="8.349">launching a review of a docket practice</text>

  <text start="742.79" dur="8.969">breaking news story broke this morning</text>
  <text start="746.439" dur="9.13">that Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck</text>
  <text start="751.759" dur="7.26">Grassley and ranking member Lindsey</text>
  <text start="755.569" dur="7.5">Graham have made a recommendation to the</text>
  <text start="759.019" dur="8.07">Department of Justice that Christopher</text>
  <text start="763.069" dur="9.06">Steele the author of the now famous</text>
  <text start="767.089" dur="10.47">Trump dossier should be charged with</text>
  <text start="772.129" dur="10.17">criminal charges and prosecuted and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="777.559" dur="8.851">going to Sundance&amp;#39;s recent thread on</text>
  <text start="782.299" dur="7.14">that issue to give you a deeper analysis</text>
  <text start="786.41" dur="5.089">of that situation because Sundance says</text>
  <text start="789.439" dur="5.85">this is not what it appears to be all</text>
  <text start="791.499" dur="5.83">right and one of the more recent dreams</text>
  <text start="795.289" dur="5.61">I had was about Sundance and Sundance</text>
  <text start="797.329" dur="6.42">was pulling out some really</text>
  <text start="800.899" dur="5.67">excellent information on some stories in</text>

  <text start="810.67" dur="6.639">deeper unspoken things that Sundance</text>
  <text start="815.869" dur="3.421">believes are going on in this kit and I</text>
  <text start="817.309" dur="5.25">think I think Sundance is probably right</text>
  <text start="819.29" dur="4.979">so Sundance starts to thread to</text>
  <text start="822.559" dur="3.9">understand this breaking news you have</text>
  <text start="824.269" dur="4.951">to understand it&amp;#39;s not about Christopher</text>
  <text start="826.459" dur="6.81">steel it&amp;#39;s not about the author of the</text>
  <text start="829.22" dur="6.059">dossier so he has a letter pasted in</text>
  <text start="833.269" dur="5.81">here which is the letter from Lindsey</text>

  <text start="891.98" dur="4.769">chairman Grassley and Lindsey Graham</text>
  <text start="894.139" dur="5.971">okay so it seems kind of straightforward</text>
  <text start="896.749" dur="6.96">but all right senators Graham and</text>

  <text start="949.31" dur="3.86">getting there</text>
  <text start="949.85" dur="6.08">Grassley and Graham are contrasting</text>

  <text start="955.93" dur="7.149">against FBI statements made in</text>
  <text start="959.66" dur="5.789">combination about those documents there</text>
  <text start="963.079" dur="6.901">is a discrepancy between the documents</text>
  <text start="965.449" dur="6.181">which were provided by the FBI that</text>

  <text start="974.569" dur="7.621">from the FBI officials who talked to</text>
  <text start="977.839" dur="7.951">Grassley and Graham what Grassley and</text>
  <text start="982.19" dur="7.8">Graham are getting at is that the FBI</text>
  <text start="985.79" dur="6.27">statements attributing information to</text>
  <text start="989.99" dur="6.51">Christopher Steele is not consistent</text>
  <text start="992.06" dur="8.279">with the underlying evidence that has</text>
  <text start="996.5" dur="7.41">been provided either Steele is lying to</text>
  <text start="1000.339" dur="6.211">the FBI or the representations that the</text>
  <text start="1003.91" dur="7.44">FBI has made to Senator Graham and</text>
  <text start="1006.55" dur="6.349">Grassley our false based on the</text>
  <text start="1011.35" dur="5.25">documents and based on the evidence</text>
  <text start="1012.899" dur="7.3">someone is lying Graham and Grassley</text>
  <text start="1016.6" dur="6.06">believe they know who is lying and it</text>
  <text start="1020.199" dur="5.13">isn&amp;#39;t Christopher Steele who has no</text>
  <text start="1022.66" dur="6.659">reason to lie in this case in front of</text>
  <text start="1025.329" dur="6.33">the FBI the fibbers are the ones who</text>
  <text start="1029.319" dur="4.38">hold the motive to lie and that would be</text>
  <text start="1031.659" dur="5.581">the FBI officials who are trying to hide</text>
  <text start="1033.699" dur="6.541">their 2016 use of the Steele dossier in</text>
  <text start="1037.24" dur="9.03">their counterintelligence operation to</text>
  <text start="1040.24" dur="9.929">get a FISA warrant so instead of calling</text>
  <text start="1046.27" dur="6.96">the FBI Liars Graham and Grassley are</text>
  <text start="1050.169" dur="5.791">filing a criminal referral requesting</text>
  <text start="1053.23" dur="3.86">the DOJ prosecute Christopher Steele as</text>
  <text start="1055.96" dur="3.839">a liar</text>
  <text start="1057.09" dur="5.709">Graham and Grassley know that the end</text>
  <text start="1059.799" dur="5.401">result of the DOJ following their</text>
  <text start="1062.799" dur="4.561">request would be to discover it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1065.2" dur="3.58">actually the FBI that is not telling the</text>
  <text start="1067.36" dur="4.79">truth</text>
  <text start="1068.78" dur="5.32">because if Grassley and Lindsay Graham</text>
  <text start="1072.15" dur="3.69">tell the DOJ you should prosecute</text>
  <text start="1074.1" dur="4.11">Christopher Steele because state</text>
  <text start="1075.84" dur="4.53">statements we&amp;#39;ve gotten from FBI agents</text>
  <text start="1078.21" dur="4.04">do not jive with the statements that are</text>
  <text start="1080.37" dur="6.179">written by Christopher Steele</text>
  <text start="1082.25" dur="9.64">Christopher Steele must be lying unless</text>
  <text start="1086.549" dur="7.171">the FBI is lying so by telling the DOJ</text>
  <text start="1091.89" dur="4.11">prosecute Christopher Steele because</text>
  <text start="1093.72" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;s lying but they&amp;#39;re really doing is</text>
  <text start="1096" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;re telling the DOJ look you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="1098.37" dur="4.169">some crooked FBI agents you need to find</text>
  <text start="1100.11" dur="5.78">out why they&amp;#39;re lying and you need to</text>
  <text start="1102.539" dur="3.351">bring them to justice</text>
  <text start="1107.669" dur="7.551">that is what Sundance thinks is really</text>
  <text start="1111.99" dur="7.11">going on and this would come back to</text>
  <text start="1115.22" dur="6.31">Peter struck Andrew McCabe and the inner</text>
  <text start="1119.1" dur="5.64">circle of people that are involved in</text>
  <text start="1121.53" dur="5.639">taking that steel dossier taking it to</text>
  <text start="1124.74" dur="5.37">FISA Court getting a warrant to surveil</text>
  <text start="1127.169" dur="7.561">the Trump team the noose is closing and</text>
  <text start="1130.11" dur="6.66">this is just another way for Grassley</text>
  <text start="1134.73" dur="3.87">because Grassley knows that these FBI</text>
  <text start="1136.77" dur="3.93">people have been lying to him forever he</text>
  <text start="1138.6" dur="4.11">has been all over their case asking for</text>
  <text start="1140.7" dur="3.719">information they&amp;#39;ve stonewalled they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1142.71" dur="4.5">slow walked everything they have lied to</text>
  <text start="1144.419" dur="3.39">him Grassley knows darn well the FBI is</text>
  <text start="1147.21" dur="3.449">lying</text>
  <text start="1147.809" dur="7.951">so this Sundance is saying this is his</text>
  <text start="1150.659" dur="9.561">way of forcing the DOJ to take action</text>
  <text start="1155.76" dur="6.899">against the liars in the FBI I think</text>
  <text start="1160.22" dur="6.79">that is an insightful way to approach it</text>
  <text start="1162.659" dur="7.351">and that is all I have for today for the</text>
  <text start="1167.01" dur="5.97">news it&amp;#39;s Friday I&amp;#39;m gonna let you out</text>
