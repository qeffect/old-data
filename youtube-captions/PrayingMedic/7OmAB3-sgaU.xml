  <text start="175.56" dur="5.789">friends with fellow by the name of mr.</text>
  <text start="177.93" dur="8.91">Miyagi and mr. Miyagi starts teaching</text>

  <text start="209.31" dur="5.91">I&amp;#39;m not learning anything about karate</text>
  <text start="210.72" dur="6.03">well Daniel was actually learning quite</text>
  <text start="215.22" dur="5.31">a bit about karate he just didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="6.06">it and in a few other scenes you mr.</text>
  <text start="220.53" dur="5.28">Miyagi explains to him that he was</text>
  <text start="222.81" dur="5.639">teaching him movements which are of</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="5.31">course important disciplines to learn in</text>
  <text start="228.449" dur="4.981">self-defense so Daniel was learning</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="4.229">about self-defense in a very covert</text>
  <text start="233.43" dur="4.019">sneaky way and he didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="235.349" dur="5.881">understand what&amp;#39;s going on in the same</text>
  <text start="237.449" dur="6.061">way that Daniel&amp;#39;s path to learning</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="4.86">self-defense and having victory over his</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="6.21">enemies seemed ineffective and foolish</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="5.819">the president&amp;#39;s path to victory over his</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="5.909">enemies has left many people scratching</text>
  <text start="251.909" dur="5.311">their heads a lot of political pundits</text>
  <text start="255.629" dur="3.841">out there commentators who do not</text>
  <text start="257.22" dur="4.169">believe the president is winning they</text>
  <text start="259.47" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t see it it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to</text>
  <text start="261.389" dur="3.781">them they just see the deep state in</text>
  <text start="263.46" dur="5.67">control and the president is</text>
  <text start="265.17" dur="6.96">losing ground every day well I don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="269.13" dur="4.98">it that way and of course all these</text>
  <text start="272.13" dur="6.9">political commentators have been saying</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="7.41">for years Trump is going to be impeached</text>
  <text start="279.03" dur="4.62">he is going to be forced to resign the</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="4.65">walls are closing in we&amp;#39;re at a tipping</text>
  <text start="283.65" dur="5.55">point every day another headline another</text>
  <text start="286.17" dur="6.27">bombshell bad news for the president and</text>
  <text start="289.2" dur="5.49">those who are pushing this pessimistic</text>
  <text start="292.44" dur="4.08">view I feel bad for them and I feel bad</text>
  <text start="294.69" dur="5.31">for anyone who&amp;#39;s been listening to it</text>
  <text start="296.52" dur="5.76">because you have to look beyond what you</text>
  <text start="300" dur="6.8">see in the natural and look at what is</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="8.04">going on in the spiritual and you know</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="5.47">one of the things that I have encouraged</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="7.02">people who are following my me on social</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="8.37">media to do is to develop discernment</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="5.01">you know what we tend to do and what the</text>
  <text start="320.64" dur="4.55">mainstream media has taught us to do is</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="6.33">to trust a brand or to trust a person</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="5.22">cnn&amp;#39;s tagline is the most trusted name</text>
  <text start="328.68" dur="5.04">in news</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="5.95">CNN uses that tagline because they want</text>
  <text start="333.72" dur="6.63">you to trust their brand they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="5.58">you to do anything but listen to what</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="3.27">they say and believe it they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="341.94" dur="3.33">you to research for yourself they want</text>
  <text start="343.62" dur="3.42">you to trust everything they tell you</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="4.77">right and a lot of political</text>
  <text start="347.04" dur="5.52">commentators are the same way they want</text>
  <text start="350.04" dur="4.2">you to trust everything they say news</text>
  <text start="352.56" dur="3.24">anchors political commentators they</text>
  <text start="354.24" dur="4.23">never want you to question what they say</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="4.86">and I have a lot of friends who ask me</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="5.28">well who should I trust I say you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="5.49">trust anybody rather than trusting a</text>
  <text start="363.75" dur="5.01">person or trusting a network or trusting</text>
  <text start="366.15" dur="4.44">an individual you need to learn to</text>
  <text start="368.76" dur="4.02">develop discernment so that you can</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="4.35">listen to any news broadcast by any</text>
  <text start="372.78" dur="5.04">person giving any information you can</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="3.36">discern truth from error right from</text>
  <text start="377.82" dur="2.22">wrong</text>
  <text start="378.3" dur="5.04">you can discern when you&amp;#39;re being lied</text>
  <text start="380.04" dur="3.48">to or when something doesn&amp;#39;t doesn&amp;#39;t add</text>
  <text start="383.34" dur="2">up</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="6.03">if someone&amp;#39;s pushing a narrative</text>
  <text start="385.34" dur="6.28">developing this sermon is huge and for</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="4.71">the people who have developed or have</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="4.83">had discernment they could see things</text>
  <text start="394.26" dur="3.85">are going on behind the scenes things on</text>
  <text start="396.45" dur="2.68">the face didn&amp;#39;t add up</text>
  <text start="398.11" dur="3.89">there were things going on behind the</text>
  <text start="399.13" dur="5.28">scenes that were not obvious to everyone</text>
  <text start="402" dur="4.71">so we have this cue post I go back to</text>
  <text start="404.41" dur="7.08">this quite often it&amp;#39;s acute post from</text>
  <text start="406.71" dur="10.6">November 14th and this was this was the</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="8.73">day after Stephen Boyd who is a deputy</text>
  <text start="417.31" dur="4.44">US Attorney General sent a letter to Bob</text>
  <text start="420.22" dur="5.16">Goodlatte trey Gowdy and members of</text>

  <text start="425.38" dur="5.33">appointed a special not a special</text>
  <text start="428.02" dur="6.72">prosecutor but a US Attorney to</text>
  <text start="430.71" dur="5.59">investigate the allegations of criminal</text>
  <text start="434.74" dur="3.87">activity they had brought to their</text>
  <text start="436.3" dur="4.47">attention so Q wrote this how do you</text>
  <text start="438.61" dur="4.62">capture a very dangerous animal deep</text>
  <text start="440.77" dur="4.05">state how do you attack it from the</text>
  <text start="443.23" dur="4.02">front do you walk through the front door</text>
  <text start="444.82" dur="4.86">do you signal ahead of time you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="4.23">be attacking how do you distinguish</text>
  <text start="449.68" dur="5.34">between good and bad</text>
  <text start="451.48" dur="4.98">discernment right so do you if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="455.02" dur="2.7">going to be taking down the deep state</text>
  <text start="456.46" dur="3.5">do you let them know ahead of time so</text>
  <text start="457.72" dur="7.02">they can make a plan of it</text>
  <text start="459.96" dur="7.78">to defend against your prosecution no</text>
  <text start="464.74" dur="4.62">you do not let a dangerous animal like</text>
  <text start="467.74" dur="3.87">the deep state know that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="469.36" dur="4.44">investigating them you have to do this</text>
  <text start="471.61" dur="5.25">in a very covert sneaky way so they</text>
  <text start="473.8" dur="4.37">don&amp;#39;t suspect anything is going on how</text>
  <text start="476.86" dur="3.93">do you still doing good in bed</text>
  <text start="478.17" dur="4.51">discernment you have to discern who is</text>
  <text start="480.79" dur="6">good and who&amp;#39;s bad who do you trust to</text>
  <text start="482.68" dur="8.1">keep secrets military intelligence</text>
  <text start="486.79" dur="6.78">mostly nothing is as it appears what</text>
  <text start="490.78" dur="5.25">show is being put on by Attorney General</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="4.68">sessions since his confirmation what</text>
  <text start="496.03" dur="5.57">show is being put on by POTUS since</text>
  <text start="498.25" dur="6.48">sessions confirmation right so</text>
  <text start="501.6" dur="6.34">president&amp;#39;s been tweeting and venting</text>
  <text start="504.73" dur="6.9">anger at Jeff Sessions the entire first</text>
  <text start="507.94" dur="5.34">year or so that he was in office because</text>
  <text start="511.63" dur="5.04">he recused himself a lot of other things</text>
  <text start="513.28" dur="5.37">but it was a show nothing is as it</text>
  <text start="516.67" dur="5.61">appears what was the DC vote break down</text>
  <text start="518.65" dur="6.36">between Trump and Clinton I think DC</text>
  <text start="522.28" dur="3.87">went more than 90 percent for Hillary a</text>
  <text start="525.01" dur="4.67">2016 election</text>
  <text start="526.15" dur="5.689">what is the nickname for DC the swamp</text>
  <text start="529.68" dur="5.04">why would sealed indictments be outside</text>
  <text start="531.839" dur="6.271">of DC jurisdiction because they would</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="6.989">not be able to impanel fair and</text>
  <text start="538.11" dur="7.979">impartial juries grand juries in the DC</text>
  <text start="541.709" dur="5.91">area they know that so the reason I mean</text>
  <text start="546.089" dur="2.821">you have all these people in Congress</text>
  <text start="547.619" dur="3.51">who when screaming for a second special</text>
  <text start="548.91" dur="4.32">counsel a second special counsel would</text>
  <text start="551.129" dur="4.2">be operating out of Washington DC they</text>
  <text start="553.23" dur="6.359">would be in paneling grand juries in the</text>
  <text start="555.329" dur="6.12">swamp sessions and Trump knew that and</text>
  <text start="559.589" dur="4.68">if they&amp;#39;re going to get these people</text>
  <text start="561.449" dur="5.851">arrested and convicted they would need</text>
  <text start="564.269" dur="6.391">to impanel grand juries outside of DC so</text>
  <text start="567.3" dur="5.81">that&amp;#39;s why they tapped Huber to do the</text>
  <text start="570.66" dur="6.599">investigations of corruption</text>
  <text start="573.11" dur="8.05">that&amp;#39;s a purpose this would serve so we</text>
  <text start="577.259" dur="6.69">are seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing some very</text>
  <text start="581.16" dur="5.789">interesting things as Q said think up</text>
  <text start="583.949" dur="4.651">here you are witnessing the systematic</text>
  <text start="586.949" dur="3.51">destruction of the old guard</text>
  <text start="588.6" dur="4.169">whether you realize it or not whether it</text>
  <text start="590.459" dur="4.831">is obvious to you or not we are watching</text>
  <text start="592.769" dur="5.401">the old guard being destroyed being the</text>
  <text start="595.29" dur="6.269">media the deep state political heads why</text>
  <text start="598.17" dur="5.849">do you think Democrats in Senate and the</text>
  <text start="601.559" dur="4.26">house are freaking out about Attorney</text>
