  <text start="1.52" dur="6.999">good morning Patriots this is pragmatic</text>
  <text start="5.1" dur="6.24">it is Saturday November 23rd and this is</text>
  <text start="8.519" dur="6.29">a special update I&amp;#39;ve got for you</text>
  <text start="11.34" dur="7.56">I made some remarks in my last broadcast</text>
  <text start="14.809" dur="8.261">about Lindsey Graham being flipped in</text>
  <text start="18.9" dur="6.299">April of 2018 and I figured I should</text>
  <text start="23.07" dur="4.86">just do a thread and do a broadcast on</text>
  <text start="25.199" dur="5.701">that and explain what I meant in this</text>
  <text start="27.93" dur="5.66">broadcast I&amp;#39;m going to explain why I</text>
  <text start="30.9" dur="5.48">believe Lindsey Graham may prove to be a</text>
  <text start="33.59" dur="9.039">stealth bomber for the president Trump</text>
  <text start="36.38" dur="8.35">okay I fully acknowledge up front that</text>
  <text start="42.629" dur="4.651">this is going to sound preposterous to a</text>
  <text start="44.73" dur="5.04">lot of people and that&amp;#39;s fine but I</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="5.4">believe Lindsey Graham who seems to be a</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="5.28">feckless worthless do-nothing senator is</text>
  <text start="52.68" dur="5.039">going to prove to be one of the key</text>
  <text start="55.05" dur="7.29">players in Trump&amp;#39;s plan to expose public</text>
  <text start="57.719" dur="7.201">corruption and prosecute the swamp now</text>
  <text start="62.34" dur="4.47">there is abundant evidence to convict</text>
  <text start="64.92" dur="5.6">Lindsey Graham or everything he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="66.81" dur="6.33">accused of being inept and effective</text>
  <text start="70.52" dur="4.3">likes to go on TV shows and be in the</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="4.29">spotlight but doesn&amp;#39;t ever seem to do</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="6.21">anything he was definitely a never Trump</text>
  <text start="77.43" dur="6.689">er at least he was some time ago but I</text>
  <text start="81.03" dur="6.12">think something else is going on that we</text>
  <text start="84.119" dur="6.75">need to pay attention to we are in a war</text>
  <text start="87.15" dur="5.73">where spies and politicians and business</text>
  <text start="90.869" dur="4.351">tycoons and intelligence gurus are</text>
  <text start="92.88" dur="6">calling the shots and because of that</text>
  <text start="95.22" dur="7.17">nothing is as it seems if we believe</text>
  <text start="98.88" dur="5.19">that Trump is a good strategist he has</text>
  <text start="102.39" dur="4.5">to have a plan that during the swamp and</text>
  <text start="104.07" dur="6.96">that plan probably isn&amp;#39;t obvious to</text>
  <text start="106.89" dur="7.11">everyone just as important as draining</text>
  <text start="111.03" dur="4.549">the swamp is making the public aware of</text>
  <text start="114" dur="4.59">the severity of corruption in government</text>
  <text start="115.579" dur="5.411">so there&amp;#39;s two terms that I use one is</text>
  <text start="118.59" dur="4.47">the storm which is a prosecution of</text>
  <text start="120.99" dur="3.9">corruption the other is the Great</text>
  <text start="123.06" dur="6.03">Awakening where we make the public aware</text>
  <text start="124.89" dur="6.45">of how bad the corruption is Trump has</text>
  <text start="129.09" dur="4.74">to have a plan to present to the public</text>
  <text start="131.34" dur="5.1">the documents and expert testimony</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="6.63">that prove objectively and conclusively</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="5.61">just how bad corruption has become for</text>
  <text start="140.46" dur="4.62">the first three years of his presidency</text>
  <text start="142.05" dur="6.24">Trump has been on defense</text>
  <text start="145.08" dur="5.15">he&amp;#39;s been fending off attacks from the</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="4.64">swamp</text>
  <text start="150.23" dur="5.56">Adams shifts impeachment inquiry is</text>
  <text start="152.93" dur="5.62">their last opportunity to remove him</text>
  <text start="155.79" dur="5.7">from office if they fail and they will</text>
  <text start="158.55" dur="5.64">fail Trump is going to take over and</text>
  <text start="161.49" dur="5.79">he&amp;#39;s going to run his offense which</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="7.58">involves exposing corruption of the</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="7.35">swamp and prosecuting these bad actors</text>
  <text start="171.77" dur="5.59">the American political system uses open</text>
  <text start="174.63" dur="4.44">televised public hearings to expose to</text>
  <text start="177.36" dur="3.96">the public the problems that are found</text>
  <text start="179.07" dur="3.93">in government in the hearings that Adam</text>
  <text start="181.32" dur="5.07">Schiff has conducted over the last few</text>
  <text start="183" dur="5.52">weeks they have tried to use private</text>
  <text start="186.39" dur="4.56">hearings to gather evidence and public</text>
  <text start="188.52" dur="5.81">hearings to make voters aware of the</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="6.54">information that they&amp;#39;ve found now</text>
  <text start="194.33" dur="5.65">Pelosi and Schiff succeeded in making</text>
  <text start="197.49" dur="4.17">the public aware of certain facts but</text>
  <text start="199.98" dur="3.45">whether they achieved their goal or not</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="3.57">has yet to be determined I would</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="3.66">actually argue that their hearings</text>
  <text start="205.23" dur="4.8">probably helped Trump more than they</text>
  <text start="207.09" dur="5.64">hurt him Democrats have been able to</text>
  <text start="210.03" dur="5.37">mount an offensive because they gained</text>
  <text start="212.73" dur="4.65">control the house in 2018 they had not</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="3.89">gained control of the house in 2018 they</text>
  <text start="217.38" dur="4.579">wouldn&amp;#39;t even be having these hearings</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="5.11">Republicans lost control of the house</text>
  <text start="221.959" dur="4.991">but they gained a larger majority in the</text>
  <text start="224.4" dur="4.53">Senate they lost never Trump errs like</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="4.2">Jeff Flake bob corker and John McCain</text>
  <text start="228.93" dur="4.55">who died before his term was up and I do</text>
  <text start="231.15" dur="6.42">realize we also still have issues like</text>
  <text start="233.48" dur="7.93">Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski and other</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="6.69">people who are not on board with the</text>
  <text start="241.41" dur="4.44">Trump plan but I think those the effect</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="5.61">of those people have is going to be</text>
  <text start="245.85" dur="6.359">neutralized I also know that Lindsey</text>
  <text start="249.87" dur="4.5">Graham and John McCain were longtime</text>
  <text start="252.209" dur="6.481">friends and they were both never Trump</text>
  <text start="254.37" dur="6.929">pers however on April 30th of 2018</text>
  <text start="258.69" dur="4.95">something significant happened that was</text>
  <text start="261.299" dur="3.331">when McCain announced he was not going</text>
  <text start="263.64" dur="3.72">to run for re-election</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="5.879">that same day April 30th</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="6.63">Lindsey Graham J had a sudden change of</text>
  <text start="270.509" dur="5.731">heart he tweeted this out james comey I</text>
  <text start="273.99" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t trust him I think he was part of</text>
  <text start="276.24" dur="4.29">an effort at the FBI to give Clinton to</text>
  <text start="278.28" dur="4.439">pass the way they conducted the</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="4.949">investigation was a joke thumb was on</text>
  <text start="282.719" dur="6.66">the scale the head investigator by the</text>
  <text start="285.479" dur="7.051">FBI hated Trump and liked Clinton okay</text>
  <text start="289.379" dur="5.731">that same day he posted a link to</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="3.659">Lindsey Graham&amp;#39;s tweet and said no name</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="3.359">out now</text>
  <text start="296.189" dur="4.021">so that&amp;#39;s a reference to no name is John</text>
  <text start="298.469" dur="5.401">McCain the fact that he was not going to</text>
  <text start="300.21" dur="5.88">run for re-election we have the link to</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="6.389">Lindsey Graham&amp;#39;s tweet Q wrote we love</text>
  <text start="306.09" dur="6.06">good singers so when someone sings they</text>
  <text start="310.259" dur="3.541">have flipped they&amp;#39;re cooperating with</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="3.479">the good guys in a criminal</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="3.209">investigation they are providing</text>
  <text start="315.629" dur="4.38">information on other people</text>
  <text start="317.009" dur="5.13">so April 30th Lindsey went from being a</text>
  <text start="320.009" dur="4.731">never Trumper to a trump supporter and</text>
  <text start="322.139" dur="6">he&amp;#39;s been a trump supporter ever since</text>
  <text start="324.74" dur="6.519">now the Senate</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="5.071">so people were understandably upset when</text>
  <text start="331.259" dur="5.011">Republicans lost control of the house</text>
  <text start="333.21" dur="7.049">but Q posted this the day after the</text>
  <text start="336.27" dur="7.53">election this is November 7th 2018 while</text>
  <text start="340.259" dur="6.27">the focus was on the house for them our</text>
  <text start="343.8" dur="5.1">underlying focus was adding pro-trump</text>
  <text start="346.529" dur="5.281">members to the Senate and safely</text>
  <text start="348.9" dur="4.739">securing a pro-trump majority the Senate</text>
  <text start="351.81" dur="3.63">is worth so much more the Senate</text>
  <text start="353.639" dur="4.89">controls judges and cabinet positions</text>
  <text start="355.44" dur="5.909">without House approval how many judges</text>
  <text start="358.529" dur="5.25">has the Senate approved that Trump is</text>
  <text start="361.349" dur="4.591">nominated I think we&amp;#39;re around a hundred</text>
  <text start="363.779" dur="4.5">and seventy right now Senate Judiciary</text>
  <text start="365.94" dur="5.99">Committee has direct oversight over the</text>
  <text start="368.279" dur="6.181">FBI and DOJ more power than the house</text>
  <text start="371.93" dur="4.93">while we had a Senate majority on paper</text>
  <text start="374.46" dur="4.65">in reality whenever did nor could we</text>
  <text start="376.86" dur="3.929">count on bringing investigations to that</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="4.019">body until it was safely in our full</text>
  <text start="380.789" dur="2.94">control the Senate was always a primary</text>
  <text start="383.129" dur="3.69">objective</text>
  <text start="383.729" dur="5.821">so lately Q has been posting the Senate</text>
  <text start="386.819" dur="5.16">was a target what he&amp;#39;s telling us is</text>
  <text start="389.55" dur="6.989">that during 2018 Trump&amp;#39;s people were</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="6.331">trying to gain a larger consent so they</text>
  <text start="396.539" dur="3.661">could bring investigations into the</text>
  <text start="398.31" dur="4.01">Senate and</text>
  <text start="400.2" dur="4.98">run Trump&amp;#39;s plan to expose corruption</text>
  <text start="402.32" dur="5.26">all right in a couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="4.38">Department of Justice Inspector General</text>
  <text start="407.58" dur="4.35">report on FISA abuse is going to be made</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="4.23">public average people are going to have</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="3.84">an opportunity to see for themselves the</text>
  <text start="413.79" dur="6.54">kind of criminal activity at the Obama</text>
  <text start="415.77" dur="6.93">administration engaged in when the IG</text>
  <text start="420.33" dur="4.44">report is made public and when Inspector</text>
  <text start="422.7" dur="4.32">General Horowitz testifies before Senate</text>
  <text start="424.77" dur="4.38">Judiciary I think that is going to mark</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="5.49">the beginning of the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.15" dur="5.31">offensive plan now people have accused</text>
  <text start="432.51" dur="4.25">Lindsay Graham of being a worthless</text>
  <text start="434.46" dur="6.3">senator he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to do anything</text>
  <text start="436.76" dur="6.85">but I think it&amp;#39;s only because his time</text>
  <text start="440.76" dur="5.37">has not yet arrived Graham&amp;#39;s greatest</text>
  <text start="443.61" dur="5.28">value to Trump is his position as chair</text>
  <text start="446.13" dur="4.53">of Senate Judiciary Committee which as Q</text>
  <text start="448.89" dur="3.38">mentioned conducts oversight over the</text>
  <text start="450.66" dur="3.9">DOJ and FBI</text>
  <text start="452.27" dur="6.34">although corruption is widespread</text>
  <text start="454.56" dur="5.94">through government what is known right</text>
  <text start="458.61" dur="4.08">now and what can be made available to</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="5.04">the public is a corruption in the FBI</text>
  <text start="462.69" dur="5.58">and DOJ now corruption in CIA State</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="5.28">Department and in White House and other</text>
  <text start="468.27" dur="4.73">agencies that&amp;#39;s going to come but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="470.82" dur="4.62">going to start with the FBI and DOJ</text>
  <text start="473" dur="4.75">Lindsey Graham&amp;#39;s role is going to be</text>
  <text start="475.44" dur="4.71">making the public aware of corruption</text>
  <text start="477.75" dur="3.99">through the testimony of the witnesses</text>
  <text start="480.15" dur="5.3">that he calls and the production of</text>
  <text start="481.74" dur="5.91">documents to his committee I believe</text>
  <text start="485.45" dur="4.84">Lindsey Graham has been biding his time</text>
  <text start="487.65" dur="4.59">waiting for his turn to be in the</text>
  <text start="490.29" dur="4.44">limelight that&amp;#39;s going to happen on</text>
  <text start="492.24" dur="6.72">December 11th when Horowitz testifies</text>
  <text start="494.73" dur="6.45">and again don&amp;#39;t forget D class so we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="498.96" dur="3.93">got thousands of documents are going to</text>
  <text start="501.18" dur="4.23">be Declassified by Attorney General bar</text>
  <text start="502.89" dur="4.47">some of those will end up in various</text>
  <text start="505.41" dur="3.84">committees Devon unions probably already</text>
  <text start="507.36" dur="5.82">has some Lindsey Graham is going to get</text>
  <text start="509.25" dur="8.849">some again more documents for the public</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="7.14">to have awareness of the IG report and D</text>
  <text start="518.099" dur="3.421">class are helpful to people who are</text>
  <text start="520.32" dur="3.42">willing to plow through a bunch of</text>
  <text start="521.52" dur="5.94">documents but the average person isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="523.74" dur="6.81">going to read them they may watch Senate</text>
  <text start="527.46" dur="5.19">hearings like they have over the last</text>
  <text start="530.55" dur="3.42">couple of weeks with Adam Schiff doing</text>
  <text start="532.65" dur="3.52">his impeachment hearings</text>
  <text start="533.97" dur="4.809">but they&amp;#39;re definitely going to watch</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="6.12">the news reports that provide summaries</text>
  <text start="538.779" dur="6.93">of the hearings on Capitol Hill right</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="5.669">and now in addition to what Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="545.709" dur="5.101">has been doing we&amp;#39;re going to be seeing</text>
  <text start="547.959" dur="5.31">news reports about the hearings in</text>
  <text start="550.81" dur="5.1">Senate Judiciary chaired by Graham</text>
  <text start="553.269" dur="4.551">they&amp;#39;d have to do with FISA abuse and</text>
  <text start="555.91" dur="5.27">corruption the FBI Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="557.82" dur="5.92">Graham during his hearings can subpoena</text>
  <text start="561.18" dur="5.409">former Obama officials he can subpoena</text>
  <text start="563.74" dur="4.77">Joe and Hunter Biden and talk about what</text>

  <text start="570.85" dur="5.46">corruption regarding ukraine grams</text>

  <text start="576.31" dur="6.51">the nuclear bomb that decimates the</text>
  <text start="578.05" dur="7.8">swamp now if Lindsey Graham does not</text>
