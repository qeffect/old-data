  <text start="74.06" dur="7.02">releasing revelation releasing whatever</text>
  <text start="76.52" dur="8.519">it is God&amp;#39;s put on your heart I think</text>
  <text start="81.08" dur="7.829">it&amp;#39;s something that people develop over</text>
  <text start="85.039" dur="5.43">time it&amp;#39;s also something that a lot of</text>
  <text start="88.909" dur="4.92">people could use to develop</text>
  <text start="90.469" dur="6.11">understanding of it&amp;#39;s something that I</text>
  <text start="93.829" dur="5.22">struggled with early on I had always</text>
  <text start="96.579" dur="6.07">replay messages that heard from people</text>
  <text start="99.049" dur="6.96">who were very inspiring to me I&amp;#39;d replay</text>
  <text start="102.649" dur="5.4">those messages in my mind mentally and I</text>
  <text start="106.009" dur="3.78">would sort of like try to act like them</text>
  <text start="108.049" dur="3.691">try to sound like them try to imitate</text>
  <text start="109.789" dur="4.83">you know there&amp;#39;s style their message</text>
  <text start="111.74" dur="6.059">whatever and then and it never came off</text>
  <text start="114.619" dur="4.801">very well I always kind of had this</text>
  <text start="117.799" dur="5.161">feeling like well that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="119.42" dur="6.54">really who I am it&amp;#39;s not my message it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.96" dur="7.2">not really my style so I struggled for a</text>
  <text start="125.96" dur="9.15">long time trying to find my own voice my</text>
  <text start="130.16" dur="9.06">own message and it it was a process for</text>
  <text start="135.11" dur="7.62">me it took me a long time to shed all of</text>
  <text start="139.22" dur="5.76">the ideas I had about how I should write</text>
  <text start="142.73" dur="6">her how I should speak but I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="144.98" dur="6.25">what once you hone in on your unique</text>
  <text start="148.73" dur="5.619">message your unique style of delivery</text>
  <text start="151.23" dur="5.819">me for whatever the message is man it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="154.349" dur="4.801">it&amp;#39;s awesome it&amp;#39;s so good i love seeing</text>
  <text start="157.049" dur="3.511">people hit their stride and really</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="6.63">develop their own voice in their own</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="7.649">message I&amp;#39;m drawn to people who are who</text>
  <text start="165.78" dur="5.13">know who they are and I believe that</text>
  <text start="168.209" dur="4.831">most people are some people are just</text>
  <text start="170.91" dur="5.4">more aware of it than others I tend to</text>
  <text start="173.04" dur="6.779">connect with people just generally that</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="6.66">are who they are regardless of what that</text>
  <text start="179.819" dur="7.441">is so if you&amp;#39;re a geeky person that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="6.42">fine I love geeky but just be who you</text>
  <text start="187.26" dur="4.589">are if you&amp;#39;re yet being authentic geek</text>
  <text start="189.39" dur="4.739">don&amp;#39;t be you wanna yeah exactly exactly</text>
  <text start="191.849" dur="4.98">if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re a jock if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="194.129" dur="6.211">genius if you&amp;#39;re you know whatever</text>
  <text start="196.829" dur="7.231">category that you know that people would</text>
  <text start="200.34" dur="5.789">put you in I I don&amp;#39;t care I really</text>
  <text start="204.06" dur="3.81">really don&amp;#39;t care in fact I enjoy that</text>
  <text start="206.129" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s certain endearing qualities</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="6.149">about different kinds of people really</text>
  <text start="209.849" dur="7.051">for me the key is is are you in touch</text>
  <text start="214.019" dur="5.041">with yourself and are you being real</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="4.8">with me because if you&amp;#39;re putting off a</text>
  <text start="219.06" dur="7.89">facade I don&amp;#39;t want a facade that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="221.7" dur="7.619">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s unattractive and I think</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="5.52">that same approach is very very</text>
  <text start="229.319" dur="5.311">important with if you&amp;#39;re developing a</text>
  <text start="232.47" dur="4.71">voice if you&amp;#39;re developing a platform if</text>
  <text start="234.63" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;re trying to figure out how to</text>
  <text start="237.18" dur="3.72">release the message that God&amp;#39;s given you</text>
  <text start="238.95" dur="4.56">or get in touch with what it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="5.55">very important that you be okay with</text>
  <text start="243.51" dur="5.52">yourself and don&amp;#39;t put forth a facade</text>
  <text start="246.45" dur="4.8">because people smell that whether they</text>
  <text start="249.03" dur="4.65">realize it or not they it&amp;#39;s like a dog</text>
  <text start="251.25" dur="4.23">with an instinct and they sniff it and</text>
  <text start="253.68" dur="5.609">they say I just I don&amp;#39;t like that it</text>
  <text start="255.48" dur="5.249">feels weird in and the church is a</text>
  <text start="259.289" dur="3.841">little bit behind the times on that</text>
  <text start="260.729" dur="4.321">unfortunately but i think it&amp;#39;s changing</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="3.93">rapidly i think people are finally</text>
  <text start="265.05" dur="4.92">starting to realize that you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="5.729">to sound like your favorite preacher you</text>
  <text start="269.97" dur="6.479">don&amp;#39;t have to you know do the same song</text>
  <text start="272.789" dur="6.151">and dance or performance or whatever do</text>
  <text start="276.449" dur="5.46">what&amp;#39;s natural to you do what feels</text>
  <text start="278.94" dur="4.38">right and you&amp;#39;ll know it&amp;#39;s funny because</text>
  <text start="281.909" dur="2.681">i think people have an innate sense</text>
  <text start="283.32" dur="3.58">within them</text>
  <text start="284.59" dur="3.87">what feels natural and what doesn&amp;#39;t yeah</text>
  <text start="286.9" dur="3.6">if you find yourself doing something</text>
  <text start="288.46" dur="6.48">that just doesn&amp;#39;t feel like you then</text>
  <text start="290.5" dur="5.49">don&amp;#39;t do it it kind of like you and I</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="4.73">were having that conversation the other</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="6.39">day about writing and blogging and I</text>
  <text start="299.67" dur="5.47">understand there are some things that it</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="5.73">would benefit me to do and I am doing</text>
  <text start="305.14" dur="5.88">more of those things but I&amp;#39;ll test it</text>
  <text start="308.11" dur="5.58">out to some extent and see if it feels</text>
  <text start="311.02" dur="4.62">natural if it doesn&amp;#39;t feel natural and</text>
  <text start="313.69" dur="4.38">if I can&amp;#39;t get into the flow and if it</text>
  <text start="315.64" dur="6.12">doesn&amp;#39;t feel right I&amp;#39;ll chop it off very</text>
  <text start="318.07" dur="6.87">quickly that again speaks to everybody</text>
  <text start="321.76" dur="4.83">unique way of delivering their message</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="3.21">their unique way of communicating with</text>
  <text start="326.59" dur="4.29">people your way is not going to be my</text>
  <text start="328.15" dur="5.58">way there there are certain things i do</text>
  <text start="330.88" dur="4.2">that will help you to do but there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="333.73" dur="3.6">way that I do them is not going to be</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="4.8">how you&amp;#39;re going to do them it goes full</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="4.41">circle back to the to the writing a book</text>
  <text start="339.88" dur="5.58">thing it&amp;#39;sit&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s this there&amp;#39;s this</text>

  <text start="347.65" dur="4.92">that one more time I&amp;#39;m going to throw up</text>
  <text start="348.85" dur="6.24">and here&amp;#39;s why here&amp;#39;s why because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="352.57" dur="5.28">true everybody does have a book in them</text>
  <text start="355.09" dur="8.09">everybody&amp;#39;s got far more than a book in</text>

  <text start="363.18" dur="6.61">streams of living water flowing from</text>
  <text start="365.65" dur="5.58">within them and have a lot to say but it</text>
  <text start="369.79" dur="3.93">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you have to write a</text>
  <text start="371.23" dur="5.24">book if you want to write a book write a</text>
  <text start="373.72" dur="4.95">book write several books be empowered</text>

  <text start="380.62" dur="4.29">do that more than I mean literally just</text>
  <text start="383.14" dur="4.92">before we got on here someone emailed me</text>
  <text start="384.91" dur="5.3">about writing a book and asking some</text>
  <text start="388.06" dur="5.51">questions and it was fun because I said</text>

  <text start="404.02" dur="4.8">really enjoy connecting with people I</text>
  <text start="406.03" dur="8.16">feel like writing sometimes limits me</text>
  <text start="408.82" dur="6.84">because I like to flow and I think video</text>
  <text start="414.19" dur="3.51">is going to end up being a pretty good</text>
  <text start="415.66" dur="2.76">medium for me to do that i&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="417.7" dur="4.41">start exploring</text>

  <text start="666.279" dur="3.98">Jeremy was really good at drawing and</text>
  <text start="668.139" dur="6.72">would draw things all day every day and</text>
  <text start="670.259" dur="8.2">would explore creativity and make cool</text>
  <text start="674.859" dur="7.02">things and I was tapping into this gift</text>
  <text start="678.459" dur="5.58">that I had it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I can I can</text>
  <text start="681.879" dur="3.811">see something and I can look at it and I</text>
  <text start="684.039" dur="3.961">can take a pencil or pen in my</text>
  <text start="685.69" dur="6.45">and I can make it look like that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="688" dur="6.42">know how I just do and so I utilized</text>
  <text start="692.14" dur="6.23">that at a young age and it was fun and I</text>
  <text start="694.42" dur="8.16">and I&amp;#39;d love to do it then I got into</text>
  <text start="698.37" dur="5.83">high school and I became recognized a</text>
  <text start="702.58" dur="3.42">lot for my art why should I got</text>
  <text start="704.2" dur="4.8">recognized a lot growing up but it</text>
  <text start="706" dur="6.18">really started to get more so in high</text>
  <text start="709" dur="5.73">school when I would create pieces and</text>
  <text start="712.18" dur="6.2">they would be entered into art shows and</text>
  <text start="714.73" dur="7.11">win awards and things like that and it</text>
  <text start="718.38" dur="5.82">stopped being fun for me because I put</text>
  <text start="721.84" dur="6.57">these expectations and I think</text>
  <text start="724.2" dur="7.09">perfectionism is married is bedfellows</text>
  <text start="728.41" dur="4.86">with expectations right you get this</text>
  <text start="731.29" dur="5.16">idea of what something has to be in your</text>
  <text start="733.27" dur="7.05">mind and then you hold yourself hostage</text>
  <text start="736.45" dur="7.2">to the fact that it has to be perfectly</text>
  <text start="740.32" dur="5.07">like that and really since i told i told</text>
  <text start="743.65" dur="3.72">you earlier that i see myself as an</text>
  <text start="745.39" dur="4.53">artist in life like I see everything I</text>
  <text start="747.37" dur="5.7">do as art it&amp;#39;s I see this creation I see</text>
  <text start="749.92" dur="5.37">it as even if it&amp;#39;s with people I feel</text>
  <text start="753.07" dur="5.49">like connecting with a person is art</text>
  <text start="755.29" dur="5.22">more than a science and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="758.56" dur="3.27">relational art it&amp;#39;s a relational art and</text>
  <text start="760.51" dur="3.57">everything that you&amp;#39;re creating your</text>
  <text start="761.83" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re pulling things and you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="764.08" dur="4.26">things you&amp;#39;re pulling things into</text>
  <text start="765.43" dur="4.68">existence so for me I would put these</text>
  <text start="768.34" dur="5.13">standards on myself that we&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="770.11" dur="6.63">stupid I mean they made I everything had</text>
  <text start="773.47" dur="4.74">to be perfect and you being a creator</text>
  <text start="776.74" dur="3.42">yourself you&amp;#39;re doing a book project</text>
  <text start="778.21" dur="3.9">really at the end of the day your books</text>
  <text start="780.16" dur="3.78">never gonna be perfect at some point you</text>
  <text start="782.11" dur="4.71">at some point you just have to walk away</text>
  <text start="783.94" dur="5.13">and say I&amp;#39;m done I&amp;#39;m done yeah just you</text>
  <text start="786.82" dur="4.17">know I think somebody once said about</text>
  <text start="789.07" dur="3.6">writing the process of writing and</text>
  <text start="790.99" dur="3.3">editing and writing and editing and</text>
  <text start="792.67" dur="3.6">editing and try to make it perfect and</text>
  <text start="794.29" dur="3.48">they said at some point you just have to</text>
  <text start="796.27" dur="4.41">fling the beast out there and let people</text>
  <text start="797.77" dur="5.31">you know have it because you can edit</text>
  <text start="800.68" dur="4.98">and and I went through this process with</text>
  <text start="803.08" dur="4.65">my first two books you could edit a book</text>
  <text start="805.66" dur="3.69">forever and no matter how many times you</text>
  <text start="807.73" dur="4.68">edit no matter how many sets of eyes</text>
  <text start="809.35" dur="4.98">look at the manuscript if you go through</text>
  <text start="812.41" dur="3.929">it again you&amp;#39;ll find more typos you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="814.33" dur="3.72">find some things that you could reword</text>
  <text start="816.339" dur="2.791">and change this sentence and move this</text>
  <text start="818.05" dur="3.06">around or add that too</text>
  <text start="819.13" dur="4.5">but you could be continually forever</text>
  <text start="821.11" dur="3.93">editing and improving and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="823.63" dur="3.3">whole perfectionism that&amp;#39;s at voice</text>
  <text start="825.04" dur="4.46">telling you it&amp;#39;s not good enough that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="826.93" dur="5.25">right that&amp;#39;s right and when really</text>
  <text start="829.5" dur="5.26">anything you create is never fully</text>
  <text start="832.18" dur="5.1">finished right there there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="834.76" dur="4.38">no finishing point and exactly you know</text>
  <text start="837.28" dur="3.84">what really helped me here here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="839.14" dur="5.64">kind of a mind bender it&amp;#39;s that I</text>
  <text start="841.12" dur="5.52">started a view life especially as a</text>
  <text start="844.78" dur="3.99">series of projects whether it&amp;#39;s a book</text>
  <text start="846.64" dur="4.22">whether it&amp;#39;s a you know a ministry or</text>
  <text start="848.77" dur="5.46">business or whatever as a series of</text>
  <text start="850.86" dur="6.76">pieces a series and so I think sometimes</text>
  <text start="854.23" dur="6.24">we have our life and and we even look at</text>
  <text start="857.62" dur="5.6">our life and perfectionism like we we we</text>
  <text start="860.47" dur="5.61">head down this path and we see that</text>
  <text start="863.22" dur="4.72">we&amp;#39;re headed towards this picture of</text>
  <text start="866.08" dur="3.54">perfection and we have to put everything</text>
  <text start="867.94" dur="2.97">in place perfectly we can&amp;#39;t make a</text>
  <text start="869.62" dur="3.42">mistake because you&amp;#39;ll ruin the</text>
  <text start="870.91" dur="4.56">masterpiece well it doesn&amp;#39;t work that</text>
  <text start="873.04" dur="4.62">way it wouldn&amp;#39;t how it works is you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="875.47" dur="4.59">creating a bunch of little projects in</text>
  <text start="877.66" dur="4.44">life whether it&amp;#39;s relationships whether</text>
  <text start="880.06" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s a family whether it&amp;#39;s projects like</text>
  <text start="882.1" dur="4.98">books or whatever you do and they all</text>
  <text start="885.22" dur="3.78">come together and make one giant</text>
  <text start="887.08" dur="4.53">masterpiece that&amp;#39;s perfect because of</text>
  <text start="889" dur="3.93">what it is and that&amp;#39;s kind of like you</text>
  <text start="891.61" dur="3.81">know that&amp;#39;s the big picture of</text>
  <text start="892.93" dur="4.74">perfectionism I think and then but it</text>
  <text start="895.42" dur="5.4">also narrows down into little projects</text>
  <text start="897.67" dur="5.43">that you do and and so that&amp;#39;s the way I</text>
  <text start="900.82" dur="5.43">look at things now is is that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="903.1" dur="5.79">creating one big piece of art which is</text>
  <text start="906.25" dur="4.92">my life that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a really good way</text>
  <text start="908.89" dur="3.81">of looking at it you know the Holy</text>
  <text start="911.17" dur="4.89">Spirit started speaking to me a few</text>
  <text start="912.7" dur="5.04">years ago and I started to really give</text>
  <text start="916.06" dur="4.83">me an understanding of how this works in</text>
  <text start="917.74" dur="6.45">the last few months there is this thing</text>
  <text start="920.89" dur="6.24">about expectations the only way you can</text>
  <text start="924.19" dur="6.06">ever be disappointed is if you have an</text>
  <text start="927.13" dur="5.61">expectation that&amp;#39;s right and what he was</text>
  <text start="930.25" dur="5.19">starting to tell me was if you will not</text>
  <text start="932.74" dur="5.7">put expectations on other people or even</text>
  <text start="935.44" dur="7.47">on yourself you will not be disappointed</text>
  <text start="938.44" dur="7.47">yeah which doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you should</text>
  <text start="942.91" dur="5.31">never aspire to do things because having</text>
  <text start="945.91" dur="4.47">aspirations and having expectations are</text>
  <text start="948.22" dur="4.679">totally different things I aspire to do</text>
  <text start="950.38" dur="6.709">a lot of different things but I</text>
  <text start="952.899" dur="6.6">at the end of the day I can&amp;#39;t put too</text>
  <text start="957.089" dur="3.61">strict of expectations on how that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="959.499" dur="3.721">going to look or what it&amp;#39;s going to you</text>
  <text start="960.699" dur="4.56">know be when it&amp;#39;s done because that if</text>
  <text start="963.22" dur="5.609">you do that you you stifle the</text>
  <text start="965.259" dur="5.19">creativity process you kind of confined</text>
  <text start="968.829" dur="3.901">the Holy Spirit as to what he can and</text>
  <text start="970.449" dur="4.711">can&amp;#39;t do with you if you start putting</text>
  <text start="972.73" dur="4.139">your expectations on something it has to</text>
  <text start="975.16" dur="3.51">meet those expectations if it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="976.869" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s a failure it&amp;#39;s not good enough it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="978.67" dur="5.25">not what you really wanted to not much</text>
  <text start="979.929" dur="6.75">you envisioned and you know God can do</text>
  <text start="983.92" dur="5.699">so much more with us and through us if</text>
  <text start="986.679" dur="6.061">we take our expectations off and allow</text>
  <text start="989.619" dur="5.57">him to basically bring his dreams for us</text>
  <text start="992.74" dur="7.349">to fruition through us that&amp;#39;s right</text>
  <text start="995.189" dur="7.63">that&amp;#39;s exactly right my amazing friend</text>
  <text start="1000.089" dur="5.22">and guy a good India with his name&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1002.819" dur="4.591">Dave he says it like this he says don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1005.309" dur="5.13">be limited to the confines of your own</text>
  <text start="1007.41" dur="6.75">expectations right and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text>
  <text start="1010.439" dur="5.281">what you said it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s we get this</text>
  <text start="1014.16" dur="5.39">picture in our head and we get ourselves</text>
  <text start="1015.72" dur="7.77">built built up and i think somewhere we</text>
  <text start="1019.55" dur="7.44">having vision is a must i believe we</text>
  <text start="1023.49" dur="7.289">need to have vision but vision is</text>
  <text start="1026.99" dur="6.579">different than maybe formula and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1030.779" dur="4.38">different it&amp;#39;s funny I was watching</text>
  <text start="1033.569" dur="5.551">actually a documentary last night on</text>
  <text start="1035.159" dur="5.91">Silicon Valley and this guy who venture</text>
  <text start="1039.12" dur="4.919">capitalists who created some gigantic</text>
  <text start="1041.069" dur="5.821">company that you know created these</text>
  <text start="1044.039" dur="4.321">inventions years ago that we now use in</text>
  <text start="1046.89" dur="3.659">everyday life that make the world turn</text>
  <text start="1048.36" dur="4.47">basically right and he see made a</text>
  <text start="1050.549" dur="7.291">statement he said you know companies</text>
  <text start="1052.83" dur="6.449">very rarely do anything that they say in</text>
  <text start="1057.84" dur="5.79">the business plan and he&amp;#39;s talking about</text>
  <text start="1059.279" dur="6.451">startup company right you know and to me</text>
  <text start="1063.63" dur="4.649">that&amp;#39;s I find so much peace in that</text>
  <text start="1065.73" dur="5.1">because sd&amp;#39;s got these are these big</text>
  <text start="1068.279" dur="5.431">dreaming guys that create things that</text>
  <text start="1070.83" dur="5.219">like like personal crafts that you can</text>
  <text start="1073.71" dur="3.689">go to space in right people that are</text>
  <text start="1076.049" dur="3">doing that kind of stuff I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1077.399" dur="3.421">that&amp;#39;s kind of realm I want to think in</text>
  <text start="1079.049" dur="3.901">that&amp;#39;s the kind of that&amp;#39;s the kind of</text>
  <text start="1080.82" dur="5.459">big thinking that I want to operate in</text>
  <text start="1082.95" dur="3.63">and so I think there&amp;#39;s something to be</text>
  <text start="1086.279" dur="3.181">said</text>
  <text start="1086.58" dur="4.86">for you know having an outline having</text>
  <text start="1089.46" dur="3.9">vision and even having a plan but just</text>
  <text start="1091.44" dur="3.989">know that your plan is going to get</text>
  <text start="1093.36" dur="4.559">messed up you&amp;#39;re going to do things that</text>
  <text start="1095.429" dur="4.411">you had you didn&amp;#39;t account for and you</text>
  <text start="1097.919" dur="3.23">just got to be okay with that and I</text>
  <text start="1099.84" dur="6.3">think that&amp;#39;s hard sometimes for people</text>
  <text start="1101.149" dur="6.64">because if you can&amp;#39;t flow then you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1106.14" dur="3.899">going to be frustrated and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1107.789" dur="4.38">walking with God to you know the other</text>
  <text start="1110.039" dur="4.11">day the other day he was he gives me</text>
  <text start="1112.169" dur="7.64">little teaching examples all the time</text>
  <text start="1114.149" dur="9.211">and I was sitting on my sofa and he said</text>
  <text start="1119.809" dur="5.321">what did he say he said draw five points</text>
  <text start="1123.36" dur="2.97">on your hand and connect them because I</text>
  <text start="1125.13" dur="3.84">didn&amp;#39;t have anything else to write on</text>
  <text start="1126.33" dur="5.479">and so I drew i drew five points when I</text>
  <text start="1128.97" dur="5.13">connected them and I made a pattern and</text>
  <text start="1131.809" dur="3.61">he just kind of chuckled he&amp;#39;s like I</text>
  <text start="1134.1" dur="3.87">wanted to see what you would make</text>
  <text start="1135.419" dur="5.1">because I didn&amp;#39;t tell you how unique I</text>
  <text start="1137.97" dur="4.169">told you that one of five points but I</text>
  <text start="1140.519" dur="3.78">didn&amp;#39;t tell you exactly how to do it</text>
  <text start="1142.139" dur="4.5">right and I think that&amp;#39;s in his nature</text>
  <text start="1144.299" dur="5.641">so often really like he might put</text>
  <text start="1146.639" dur="6.571">something you might say write a book or</text>
  <text start="1149.94" dur="8.55">do this or do that and you have so much</text>
  <text start="1153.21" dur="6.689">freedom in and in the variables of where</text>
  <text start="1158.49" dur="3.87">it could go and what it could look like</text>

  <text start="1248.66" dur="5.01">conclusion that that God has given him</text>
  <text start="1251.21" dur="5.55">the passions and the desires and some</text>
  <text start="1253.67" dur="5.28">talent and some gifts and has inspired</text>
  <text start="1256.76" dur="4.59">him to do things but has really left it</text>
  <text start="1258.95" dur="4.98">up to him as to how he works that out in</text>
  <text start="1261.35" dur="3.81">his life as to where he chooses to do it</text>
  <text start="1263.93" dur="3.36">whether it&amp;#39;s at a fire department or</text>
  <text start="1265.16" dur="4.65">some other place or being a movie star</text>
  <text start="1267.29" dur="6.03">or you know being an author or all of</text>
  <text start="1269.81" dur="7.35">the above now and I&amp;#39;m this I&amp;#39;m on the</text>
  <text start="1273.32" dur="5.16">same page you know God has given me and</text>
  <text start="1277.16" dur="3.9">you and all of us different gifts</text>
  <text start="1278.48" dur="5.19">talents abilities dreams aspirations and</text>
  <text start="1281.06" dur="4.05">then he says look there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="1283.67" dur="4.26">of open doors over there go pick one</text>
  <text start="1285.11" dur="5">which what do you want to do how do you</text>
  <text start="1287.93" dur="4.59">want this to work you know God doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1290.11" dur="5.53">really sit down and tell me how I have</text>
  <text start="1292.52" dur="6.9">to publish a book that right now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1295.64" dur="5.67">thinking about possibly taking the sum</text>
  <text start="1299.42" dur="3.39">of the InDesign work away from my wife</text>
  <text start="1301.31" dur="3.03">and giving it to somebody else because</text>
  <text start="1302.81" dur="2.73">it takes up a lot of her time and she</text>
  <text start="1304.34" dur="2.61">could be doing other things with the</text>
  <text start="1305.54" dur="3.81">time and she doesn&amp;#39;t really enjoy doing</text>
  <text start="1306.95" dur="4.62">it that much I may try to steal it from</text>
  <text start="1309.35" dur="4.29">her and do the InDesign work myself if</text>
  <text start="1311.57" dur="4.89">she can teach me how to do it I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="1313.64" dur="5.48">some of it but not a lot of it um how we</text>
  <text start="1316.46" dur="5.64">do something how we actually work out</text>
  <text start="1319.12" dur="5.14">the things that God wants us to do is I</text>
  <text start="1322.1" dur="3.81">think is really completely up to us he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1324.26" dur="4.8">not a control freak not as much as</text>
  <text start="1325.91" dur="7.29">people think he is yeah I&amp;#39;m with you one</text>
  <text start="1329.06" dur="5.82">hundred and twenty percent and you know</text>
  <text start="1333.2" dur="5.22">my third book that I&amp;#39;m working on right</text>
  <text start="1334.88" dur="5.34">now is actually this whole thing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1338.42" dur="3.48">about the perfectionism it&amp;#39;s about I</text>
  <text start="1340.22" dur="2.76">have a working title right now and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1341.9" dur="2.67">probably going to call it something else</text>
  <text start="1342.98" dur="3.57">but I had it&amp;#39;s called the other side of</text>
  <text start="1344.57" dur="3.57">freedom what the heck do you do once you</text>
  <text start="1346.55" dur="2.97">realize you&amp;#39;re free like what does it</text>
  <text start="1348.14" dur="3.09">look like walk in that kind of freedom</text>
  <text start="1349.52" dur="4.2">because as far as I&amp;#39;m concerned there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1351.23" dur="4.32">not a whole lot of teaching as far as</text>
  <text start="1353.72" dur="4.28">how to handle this freedom and I really</text>
  <text start="1355.55" dur="5.48">really want to help people with that and</text>
  <text start="1358" dur="5.47">I&amp;#39;m with you and I&amp;#39;m with Jesse and</text>
  <text start="1361.03" dur="4.78">that&amp;#39;s my understanding that&amp;#39;s the way</text>
  <text start="1363.47" dur="5.55">God&amp;#39;s handled me but it&amp;#39;s almost the</text>
  <text start="1365.81" dur="5.55">both and situation because I think we</text>
  <text start="1369.02" dur="4.29">look for one or the other is it right as</text>
  <text start="1371.36" dur="4.26">does God just let us make all these</text>
  <text start="1373.31" dur="4.95">decisions I want to know is a black or</text>
  <text start="1375.62" dur="6.09">white or does God micromanage us which</text>
  <text start="1378.26" dur="5.85">one is it and I hear people teaching the</text>
  <text start="1381.71" dur="4.08">the freedom one in the micromanaging and</text>
  <text start="1384.11" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re like which is it and I say both</text>
  <text start="1385.79" dur="5.58">and and and here&amp;#39;s why when I first</text>
  <text start="1389.33" dur="4.8">awakened was awakened by the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="1391.37" dur="5.43">it got to know him he was very hands-on</text>
  <text start="1394.13" dur="5.55">with me he would do he would say go left</text>
  <text start="1396.8" dur="6.41">go right to this do that he treated me</text>
  <text start="1399.68" dur="8.06">almost as if I were a child as he should</text>
  <text start="1403.21" dur="8.59">because I was a little baby spiritually</text>
  <text start="1407.74" dur="6.4">he was maturing me and he was helping me</text>
  <text start="1411.8" dur="4.02">he was teaching me dependence on him he</text>
  <text start="1414.14" dur="4.02">is teaching me how to walk in intimacy</text>
  <text start="1415.82" dur="5.69">with him it&amp;#39;s right but but like any</text>
  <text start="1418.16" dur="6.78">good father I believe God wants us to</text>
  <text start="1421.51" dur="6.19">develop into the person to where we can</text>
  <text start="1424.94" dur="6.84">he can say things like what do you want</text>
  <text start="1427.7" dur="7.05">to do son make a decision I will back</text>
  <text start="1431.78" dur="4.5">you I will back you do what you want to</text>
  <text start="1434.75" dur="3.51">do or not do what you want to do but</text>
  <text start="1436.28" dur="3.96">like he&amp;#39;ll ask you questions like that</text>
  <text start="1438.26" dur="4.83">and lead you into coming up with the</text>
  <text start="1440.24" dur="4.35">answers and that&amp;#39;s why I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1443.09" dur="4.92">important to kind of go through the</text>
  <text start="1444.59" dur="6.63">funnel of intimacy with God I think if</text>
  <text start="1448.01" dur="4.62">we throw ever throw the teaching at</text>
  <text start="1451.22" dur="3.54">everyone that you&amp;#39;re just free and you</text>
  <text start="1452.63" dur="4.4">can do whatever you want there&amp;#39;s truth</text>
  <text start="1454.76" dur="4.68">to that like legally you totally can</text>
  <text start="1457.03" dur="5.47">there&amp;#39;s no condemnation God&amp;#39;s not going</text>
  <text start="1459.44" dur="6.54">to be mad at you but you might stumble a</text>
  <text start="1462.5" dur="5.85">lot more so I think if there was kind of</text>
  <text start="1465.98" dur="3.69">like a foundation built in people to</text>
  <text start="1468.35" dur="2.94">where they really get to know their</text>
  <text start="1469.67" dur="4.35">voice they get to know the voice of God</text>
  <text start="1471.29" dur="4.95">they find out who they are they learn</text>
  <text start="1474.02" dur="4.61">the basics of the ways of God and all</text>
  <text start="1476.24" dur="7.35">this stuff and then God will tutor them</text>
  <text start="1478.63" dur="8.5">into a training program of coming into</text>
  <text start="1483.59" dur="4.11">this freedom otherwise you might just</text>
  <text start="1487.13" dur="2.759">have the</text>
  <text start="1487.7" dur="4.199">galatea freedom in your mind but really</text>
  <text start="1489.889" dur="6.181">you&amp;#39;re still a slave is an eccentric</text>
  <text start="1491.899" dur="7.351">yeah so i 100% in with with you guys in</text>
  <text start="1496.07" dur="4.53">that and god that&amp;#39;s where God has me but</text>
  <text start="1499.25" dur="2.549">I see other people I&amp;#39;m like they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1500.6" dur="3.39">ready for that kind of freedom they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1501.799" dur="4.081">kill themself right know exactly and I</text>
  <text start="1503.99" dur="4.529">think I think it is a process and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1505.88" dur="5.19">all on a continuum where we start out</text>
  <text start="1508.519" dur="4.351">needing him to guide us every single</text>
  <text start="1511.07" dur="6.329">step and teach us and show us and all</text>
  <text start="1512.87" dur="8.519">but then as you mature there&amp;#39;s the how</text>
  <text start="1517.399" dur="5.581">freedom is outworked changes and so you</text>
  <text start="1521.389" dur="5.221">just brought up two subjects that I</text>
  <text start="1522.98" dur="5.88">wanted to ask you about one is uh this</text>
  <text start="1526.61" dur="3.36">teaching that you just talked about so</text>
  <text start="1528.86" dur="4.279">here&amp;#39;s my question if there&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1529.97" dur="6.419">teaching or concept about God that is</text>
  <text start="1533.139" dur="5.111">common in the world and you could wave a</text>
  <text start="1536.389" dur="6.471">magic wand and make it disappear what</text>
  <text start="1538.25" dur="8.549">would it be that is a great question I</text>
  <text start="1542.86" dur="6.64">don&amp;#39;t know and here&amp;#39;s the thing i don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1546.799" dur="6.12">think in those terms i really really</text>
  <text start="1549.5" dur="5.25">don&amp;#39;t um all right let me let me</text>
  <text start="1552.919" dur="4.86">rephrase the question have you ever been</text>
  <text start="1554.75" dur="4.529">in like listening to a message oh I got</text>
  <text start="1557.779" dur="3.931">it I got you heard somebody say</text>
  <text start="1559.279" dur="4.441">something that just so aggravated or</text>
  <text start="1561.71" dur="3.839">irritated you at your core of who you</text>
  <text start="1563.72" dur="4.38">are just like I really wish people would</text>
  <text start="1565.549" dur="5.401">stop saying that okay yes yes yes lemme</text>
  <text start="1568.1" dur="7.53">revert backwards there is one teaching</text>
  <text start="1570.95" dur="7.02">and I hate it with a passion okay okay</text>
  <text start="1575.63" dur="4.86">what is that I&amp;#39;m a very blunt person I</text>
  <text start="1577.97" dur="5.939">don&amp;#39;t have soft words for it it is the</text>
  <text start="1580.49" dur="5.429">dark night of the soul I absolutely hate</text>
  <text start="1583.909" dur="4.14">that teaching sorry people if that</text>
  <text start="1585.919" dur="3.301">offends you I we can still be friends if</text>
  <text start="1588.049" dur="4.38">you want to have a dark night of the</text>
  <text start="1589.22" dur="5.069">soul I still love you people tried to</text>
  <text start="1592.429" dur="4.081">install that in me when I first got to</text>
  <text start="1594.289" dur="4.441">know the Lord and I just wasn&amp;#39;t having</text>
  <text start="1596.51" dur="3.6">it because I&amp;#39;m like way too you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1598.73" dur="2.88">pull the wool over my eyes with this</text>
  <text start="1600.11" dur="4.679">kind of stuff because I know this guy</text>
  <text start="1601.61" dur="6.51">this guy will never go silent on me he</text>
  <text start="1604.789" dur="5.49">never hides himself from me period and</text>
  <text start="1608.12" dur="5.549">that&amp;#39;s the cool thing about knowing God</text>
  <text start="1610.279" dur="5.221">is that for me like I got to know God</text>
  <text start="1613.669" dur="4.38">before I learned a lot of the teachings</text>
  <text start="1615.5" dur="5.039">that I hold steadfast in right now I</text>
  <text start="1618.049" dur="3.531">call it backwards revelation pretty much</text>
  <text start="1620.539" dur="3.291">anything that I live</text>
  <text start="1621.58" dur="4.71">by now and this is hard for a lot of</text>
  <text start="1623.83" dur="5.43">Christians because I mean really you</text>
  <text start="1626.29" dur="4.62">could throw the the Bible legal rule</text>
  <text start="1629.26" dur="4.85">book at me and convict me and throw me</text>
  <text start="1630.91" dur="7.74">in spiritual prison if you wanted to but</text>
  <text start="1634.11" dur="7.11">I&amp;#39;m not going there no I&amp;#39;m not wearing</text>
  <text start="1638.65" dur="5.04">that kind of condemnation but God always</text>
  <text start="1641.22" dur="4.21">teaches me things and shows me things or</text>
  <text start="1643.69" dur="3.27">lets me experience things before i get</text>
  <text start="1645.43" dur="3.24">the understanding for what they are I</text>
  <text start="1646.96" dur="3.09">don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s for everybody but</text>
  <text start="1648.67" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s the way he works with me well I</text>
  <text start="1650.05" dur="6.15">got to know this god of grace I got to</text>
  <text start="1652.99" dur="6.21">know this god of intimacy before I</text>
  <text start="1656.2" dur="5.88">understood necessarily the scriptural</text>
  <text start="1659.2" dur="4.26">backing behind the teaching but so when</text>
  <text start="1662.08" dur="3.9">I heard the teachings I&amp;#39;m just like okay</text>
  <text start="1663.46" dur="5.91">that&amp;#39;s great that makes sense okay yeah</text>
  <text start="1665.98" dur="6.18">okay I&amp;#39;m with you yeah I think I like</text>
  <text start="1669.37" dur="4.11">what Chris balaton said if you ever run</text>
  <text start="1672.16" dur="3.93">into a point your life where you think</text>
  <text start="1673.48" dur="4.59">God&amp;#39;s not speaking to you anymore tune</text>
  <text start="1676.09" dur="4.26">in to a different frequency because he</text>
  <text start="1678.07" dur="4.83">has not stopped speaking you have</text>
  <text start="1680.35" dur="4.2">stopped hearing him in the language and</text>
  <text start="1682.9" dur="3.24">the frequency he&amp;#39;s trying to speak to</text>
  <text start="1684.55" dur="3.18">you in Sam&amp;#39;s trying to stretch you and</text>
  <text start="1686.14" dur="4.44">get you to hear him in a different way</text>
  <text start="1687.73" dur="4.44">that&amp;#39;s exactly right that&amp;#39;s it if you</text>
  <text start="1690.58" dur="3.39">want to believe that you have a dark</text>
  <text start="1692.17" dur="6.12">night of the soul then you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1693.97" dur="6.57">have one most of the people that I know</text>
  <text start="1698.29" dur="3.69">and it&amp;#39;s really just a couple that that</text>
  <text start="1700.54" dur="2.97">that kind of wanted and still that</text>
  <text start="1701.98" dur="2.88">teaching in people there&amp;#39;s some of the</text>
  <text start="1703.51" dur="3.39">most depressed people I&amp;#39;ve ever met in</text>
  <text start="1704.86" dur="5.91">my life and they&amp;#39;ve struggled with</text>
  <text start="1706.9" dur="5.76">actual depression like non-stop it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2032.92" dur="4.8">can be very frustrating because some</text>
  <text start="2035.98" dur="4.05">people will go right back into religion</text>
  <text start="2037.72" dur="3.84">once you know they get a taste of</text>
  <text start="2040.03" dur="4.26">freedom and they think wow this is kind</text>
  <text start="2041.56" dur="5.07">of scary isn&amp;#39;t there are some people who</text>
  <text start="2044.29" dur="4.2">have a real hard time actually where the</text>
  <text start="2046.63" dur="4.23">rubber meets the road taking off and</text>
  <text start="2048.49" dur="3.87">making this stuff happen and actually</text>
  <text start="2050.86" dur="4.53">doing the things you&amp;#39;re supposed to be</text>
  <text start="2052.36" dur="5.4">doing but you can see in somebody the</text>
  <text start="2055.39" dur="4.26">talents and the gifts and the dreams</text>
  <text start="2057.76" dur="5.669">that God has given them and you can</text>

  <text start="2065.32" dur="5.22">doing and yet they&amp;#39;ll sit there and do</text>
  <text start="2067.66" dur="4.86">and won&amp;#39;t do anything to make go forward</text>
  <text start="2070.54" dur="4.08">they won&amp;#39;t take any steps they&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="2131.71" dur="2.85">get around people who are actually</text>
  <text start="2132.88" dur="4.08">interested and are actually starting to</text>
  <text start="2134.56" dur="4.56">successfully do this it&amp;#39;s amazing and</text>
  <text start="2136.96" dur="4.2">now I&amp;#39;m getting to the place where you</text>
  <text start="2139.12" dur="4.2">are like wow man I mean with this group</text>
  <text start="2141.16" dur="4.35">of people who are just they get it they</text>
  <text start="2143.32" dur="3.87">totally get it and they&amp;#39;re doing it and</text>
  <text start="2145.51" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re growing and yeah they make some</text>
  <text start="2147.19" dur="5.7">mistakes and they fall down but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2149.74" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s so awesome to be finally connected</text>
  <text start="2152.89" dur="3.6">to some people who are consistently just</text>
  <text start="2155.29" dur="3.48">nailing it</text>
  <text start="2156.49" dur="4.26">on a daily basis and those are the</text>
  <text start="2158.77" dur="4.74">people I really i love encouraging them</text>
  <text start="2160.75" dur="7.55">and helping them out yeah have you ever</text>
  <text start="2163.51" dur="7.1">heard the saying you are the some of the</text>
  <text start="2168.3" dur="8.47">five people you spend the most time with</text>
  <text start="2170.61" dur="8.2">no well that&amp;#39;s true there&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="2176.77" dur="8.04">some truth to it though there really is</text>
  <text start="2178.81" dur="9.72">and you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s tough because the</text>
  <text start="2184.81" dur="7.11">whole loving like Jesus the whole caring</text>
  <text start="2188.53" dur="5.58">for people we do homeless outreach and</text>
  <text start="2191.92" dur="5.91">things like that here in New Orleans we</text>
  <text start="2194.11" dur="6.24">we spend time with people that maybe</text>
  <text start="2197.83" dur="5.55">aren&amp;#39;t anywhere close to walking with</text>
  <text start="2200.35" dur="5.37">God or to being actively engaged in</text>
  <text start="2203.38" dur="6.6">their spiritual development and growth</text>
  <text start="2205.72" dur="6.24">and things like that so you never ever</text>
  <text start="2209.98" dur="5.75">ever want to turn your back on people</text>
  <text start="2211.96" dur="7.79">that aren&amp;#39;t growing and walking with God</text>
  <text start="2215.73" dur="6.37">but there&amp;#39;s so much to be said about</text>
  <text start="2219.75" dur="4.15">aligning yourself with people that are</text>
  <text start="2222.1" dur="6.03">moving forward if you&amp;#39;re a person that</text>
  <text start="2223.9" dur="6.06">wants to move forward and it&amp;#39;s okay if</text>
  <text start="2228.13" dur="4.41">people aren&amp;#39;t ready for that it&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="2229.96" dur="4.95">if they want to be stagnant in life but</text>
  <text start="2232.54" dur="5.16">here&amp;#39;s the thing with me personally I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2234.91" dur="5.49">not a stagnant person I&amp;#39;m never going to</text>
  <text start="2237.7" dur="4.68">be a stagnant person fortunately I have</text>
  <text start="2240.4" dur="4.83">an amazing wife who feels the same way</text>
  <text start="2242.38" dur="4.29">and you know we never hinder each other</text>
  <text start="2245.23" dur="5.49">and we&amp;#39;re always moving forward together</text>
  <text start="2246.67" dur="6.09">and it&amp;#39;s really fun to connect and align</text>
  <text start="2250.72" dur="4.53">yourself with people who not only want</text>
  <text start="2252.76" dur="4.89">to do the same but don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="2255.25" dur="4.5">want to hold you back because a lot of</text>
  <text start="2257.65" dur="3.69">people and I don&amp;#39;t know whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2259.75" dur="3.42">just in general or whether it&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="2261.34" dur="4.89">church or whatever when they see someone</text>
  <text start="2263.17" dur="5.4">developing it they&amp;#39;re so comfortable</text>
  <text start="2266.23" dur="5.61">with that person being who they were and</text>
  <text start="2268.57" dur="6.24">they don&amp;#39;t realize it but maybe they</text>
  <text start="2271.84" dur="5.31">enter their progress yeah went when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2274.81" dur="4.5">the crab bucket mentality all that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2560.349" dur="6.51">that gets a lot of traffic I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2563.89" dur="5.399">the same mentality yeah and and I think</text>
  <text start="2566.859" dur="4.23">we over spiritualize it and I don&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="2569.289" dur="3.421">to take away take credit away from over</text>
  <text start="2571.089" dur="5.671">spirits you know from the spiritual life</text>
  <text start="2572.71" dur="7.01">but excuses are excuses and there are</text>
  <text start="2576.76" dur="6.269">people people with mental blocks and and</text>
  <text start="2579.72" dur="4.93">limited thinking is what it is it&amp;#39;s yeah</text>
  <text start="2583.029" dur="4.231">all the reasons why you can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="2584.65" dur="5.639">something when really almost none of</text>
  <text start="2587.26" dur="4.799">those reasons are really reality it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2592.059" dur="7.171">take head-on in my next book on seeing</text>
  <text start="2595.24" dur="7.14">in the spirit is is to destroy some</text>
  <text start="2599.23" dur="6.54">mindsets and some religious beliefs that</text>
  <text start="2602.38" dur="5.55">only certain people have the gift of</text>

  <text start="2612.549" dur="3.961">only certain people get absolutely do</text>
  <text start="2614.98" dur="4.079">not believe that&amp;#39;s true I think it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2622.809" dur="3.451">misconceptions people have about that</text>
  <text start="2624.46" dur="3.27">that particular thing because I really</text>
  <text start="2626.26" dur="3.809">do believe that anyone can see in the</text>
  <text start="2627.73" dur="4.5">spirit because i never saw visions and</text>
  <text start="2630.069" dur="4.05">neither did my wife until recently we</text>
  <text start="2632.23" dur="4.65">went through this process where we</text>
  <text start="2634.119" dur="5.881">developed in our spiritual eyes and i</text>
  <text start="2636.88" dur="4.8">think anyone could do it but there you</text>
  <text start="2640" dur="3.109">said people tend to over spiritualize</text>
  <text start="2641.68" dur="4.26">this I think it&amp;#39;s true I think people</text>
  <text start="2643.109" dur="5.381">want to because they can&amp;#39;t or they</text>
  <text start="2645.94" dur="6.179">because they aren&amp;#39;t seeing something</text>
  <text start="2648.49" dur="5.789">happen they have to come up with a</text>
  <text start="2652.119" dur="5.041">reason why it&amp;#39;s not happening right well</text>
  <text start="2654.279" dur="4.381">I don&amp;#39;t have the gift or you know I</text>
  <text start="2657.16" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t have the anointing or whatever</text>
  <text start="2658.66" dur="6">there&amp;#39;s these reasons in there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2661" dur="6.299">not true right if you persist and if you</text>
  <text start="2664.66" dur="6.36">go after these things that you will see</text>

  <text start="2736.18" dur="6">together getting to know one another</text>
  <text start="2737.5" dur="6.72">talking and we we realized that I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="2744.22" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s a lot of physical attraction</text>
  <text start="2746.14" dur="7.29">she&amp;#39;s gorgeous that&amp;#39;s a given but we</text>
  <text start="2749.68" dur="6.899">connected on a deeper level because of</text>
  <text start="2753.43" dur="5.97">that we found that we&amp;#39;re really really</text>
  <text start="2756.579" dur="5.881">good friends and even now to this day my</text>
  <text start="2759.4" dur="4.56">favorite thing to do is to go on dates</text>

  <text start="2763.96" dur="4.98">talking connecting find out what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2766.48" dur="4.74">on with her share what&amp;#39;s going on with</text>
  <text start="2768.94" dur="3.84">me whatever just just spend time</text>
  <text start="2771.22" dur="6.18">together even if it&amp;#39;s just going to get</text>
  <text start="2772.78" dur="7.65">coffee going to dinner whatever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2777.4" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s not a duty I don&amp;#39;t ever feel like I</text>
  <text start="2780.43" dur="5.52">I always look forward to being with her</text>
  <text start="2783.67" dur="4.59">always I look forward to coming home at</text>
  <text start="2785.95" dur="8.159">the end of the day to her and my boys</text>
  <text start="2788.26" dur="9.859">and it I credit her for most of that I</text>
  <text start="2794.109" dur="7.551">mean it&amp;#39;s she she&amp;#39;s an amazing woman who</text>
  <text start="2798.119" dur="8.411">hears her peers her magic elixir ready</text>
  <text start="2801.66" dur="7.9">she knows who she is and she&amp;#39;s secure</text>
  <text start="2806.53" dur="4.68">and herself more so than any other</text>
  <text start="2809.56" dur="4.65">person I&amp;#39;ve seen walk the planet earth</text>
  <text start="2811.21" dur="5.07">and its profound and it gives her the</text>
  <text start="2814.21" dur="4.95">ability to love me and our family and</text>
  <text start="2816.28" dur="4.829">other people with zero agenda I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="2819.16" dur="3.689">seen anything like it and anybody who</text>
  <text start="2821.109" dur="3.271">knows her would say the same thing</text>
  <text start="2822.849" dur="5.071">there&amp;#39;s nobody that would say any</text>
  <text start="2824.38" dur="5.79">and otherwise and I think because of</text>
  <text start="2827.92" dur="4.08">that we&amp;#39;re just a good team and I credit</text>
  <text start="2830.17" dur="5.79">her for all that really I mean I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="2832" dur="6.69">kind of along for the ride no I mean I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2835.96" dur="4.77">joking about that but we were completely</text>
  <text start="2838.69" dur="3.659">different and we&amp;#39;re okay with that we</text>
  <text start="2840.73" dur="3.089">appreciate one another so I think</text>
  <text start="2842.349" dur="4.71">because that were a team we work to our</text>
  <text start="2843.819" dur="5.641">strengths so she&amp;#39;s very organized and</text>
  <text start="2847.059" dur="4.46">detailed I&amp;#39;m you put me in charge of</text>
  <text start="2849.46" dur="5.369">details we&amp;#39;re going to be in big trouble</text>
  <text start="2851.519" dur="6.01">so just things like that and here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2854.829" dur="4.321">one key here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the biggest key</text>
  <text start="2857.529" dur="4.141">that when anybody asks for marriage</text>
  <text start="2859.15" dur="6.359">advice I don&amp;#39;t claim to have any advice</text>
  <text start="2861.67" dur="7.53">to give but this is the one thing that I</text>
  <text start="2865.509" dur="5.221">give that works for us because we hear I</text>
  <text start="2869.2" dur="6.26">hear that the main things that couples</text>
  <text start="2870.73" dur="8.52">fight over our sex money and in-laws I</text>
  <text start="2875.46" dur="6.94">think two of those well really all three</text>
  <text start="2879.25" dur="6.569">I feel like are taken care of with this</text>
  <text start="2882.4" dur="4.889">it&amp;#39;s that with her and I we discovered</text>
  <text start="2885.819" dur="3.811">somewhere along the way that we had an</text>
  <text start="2887.289" dur="5.04">unspoken rule that we never put in place</text>
  <text start="2889.63" dur="5.79">but we both just kind of operated by and</text>
  <text start="2892.329" dur="5.851">it was so awesome because it kept us</text>
  <text start="2895.42" dur="5.429">from fighting over the stupidest little</text>
  <text start="2898.18" dur="4.619">things and that is we take each other in</text>
  <text start="2900.849" dur="4.26">the consideration on the smallest things</text>
  <text start="2902.799" dur="4.381">and the biggest things so whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2905.109" dur="4.68">like let&amp;#39;s say money for example whether</text>
  <text start="2907.18" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s spending ten dollars or ten</text>
  <text start="2909.789" dur="3.961">thousand dollars which I don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="2911.65" dur="5.25">ability to spend that by the way that&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2913.75" dur="7.109">be awesome the first thought in my mind</text>
  <text start="2916.9" dur="6.869">is with Shannon be okay with this what</text>
  <text start="2920.859" dur="4.891">how would it affect her I usually I ask</text>
  <text start="2923.769" dur="4.59">and just bag and cool with this yeah I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2925.75" dur="5.279">cool with this and but but it&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="2928.359" dur="4.861">just the mindset of saying how does this</text>
  <text start="2931.029" dur="5.52">affect the other person and then here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2933.22" dur="5.01">here&amp;#39;s the key if we can&amp;#39;t agree on it</text>
  <text start="2936.549" dur="5.101">if we can&amp;#39;t agree on something it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2938.23" dur="5.73">worth it right so like if I bring</text>
  <text start="2941.65" dur="4.199">something to her and she&amp;#39;s so awesome</text>
  <text start="2943.96" dur="3.809">usually she was like yeah go ahead you</text>
  <text start="2945.849" dur="4.621">know because we just had this built in</text>
  <text start="2947.769" dur="4.141">the first key takes care of the second</text>
  <text start="2950.47" dur="2.849">one because by the time you even bring</text>
  <text start="2951.91" dur="4.139">it to the person you&amp;#39;ve already run it</text>
  <text start="2953.319" dur="4.53">through your filter of how would they</text>
  <text start="2956.049" dur="2.191">feel about it so if you actually bring</text>
  <text start="2957.849" dur="3.421">it to</text>
  <text start="2958.24" dur="5.75">then it&amp;#39;s usually a passable request</text>
  <text start="2961.27" dur="4.83">anyways you understand I&amp;#39;m saying so yep</text>
  <text start="2963.99" dur="3.67">but if for some reason the other ones</text>
  <text start="2966.1" dur="3.36">like no you know for some reason that</text>
  <text start="2967.66" dur="3.209">just doesn&amp;#39;t feel right you know I feel</text>
  <text start="2969.46" dur="3.18">like the Lord saying something different</text>

  <text start="2981.22" dur="6.93">interesting you probably don&amp;#39;t know this</text>
  <text start="2982.56" dur="8.59">that concept when my wife and i first</text>
  <text start="2988.15" dur="5.04">got married we read a lot of books on</text>
  <text start="2991.15" dur="5.64">marriage because we had both screwed up</text>
  <text start="2993.19" dur="5.31">our marriages previously so we read some</text>

  <text start="3026.19" dur="7.26">that a person does they&amp;#39;re either know</text>
  <text start="3030.18" dur="6.11">or suspect that their spouse would</text>
  <text start="3033.45" dur="5.4">disapprove of and yet they do it anyways</text>
  <text start="3036.29" dur="7.06">the danger with this independent</text>
  <text start="3038.85" dur="7.62">behavior is if you look at marriage the</text>
  <text start="3043.35" dur="7.23">way Jesus looks at marriage we&amp;#39;re not</text>

  <text start="3068.1" dur="5.64">glory is so that we might be one well I</text>
  <text start="3070.58" dur="5.74">don&amp;#39;t think we really take this whole</text>
  <text start="3073.74" dur="6.03">the two shall become one thing seriously</text>
  <text start="3076.32" dur="9.9">enough because when you become one as a</text>
  <text start="3079.77" dur="8.52">couple you really can&amp;#39;t engage in</text>
  <text start="3086.22" dur="3.36">independent behavior anymore and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3088.29" dur="3.09">the one thing that a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="3089.58" dur="2.7">a hard time with it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s like</text>

  <text start="3116.28" dur="5.13">different emotional needs people have</text>
  <text start="3117.9" dur="4.92">and most men have a strong need to do</text>
  <text start="3121.41" dur="4.74">things with their spouse from</text>
  <text start="3122.82" dur="5.97">recreational activity with spouse it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3126.15" dur="5.28">really big thing for men and a lot of</text>
  <text start="3128.79" dur="3.81">the reasons why men want to engage in</text>
  <text start="3131.43" dur="2.97">these recreational activities are</text>
  <text start="3132.6" dur="3.27">hunting or bowling or going out to</text>
  <text start="3134.4" dur="5.28">sports bars watching football without</text>
  <text start="3135.87" dur="5.34">their wives is what they really want the</text>
  <text start="3139.68" dur="2.55">if they could get their wife to go along</text>
  <text start="3141.21" dur="3.69">with them they would probably prefer</text>
  <text start="3142.23" dur="3.78">that but a lot of wives won&amp;#39;t do it and</text>
  <text start="3144.9" dur="2.49">then why is getting involved in doing</text>
  <text start="3146.01" dur="2.82">things without their husbands and then</text>
  <text start="3147.39" dur="3.27">you get into this whole thing where</text>
  <text start="3148.83" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;re spending all this time away from</text>
  <text start="3150.66" dur="5.19">each other doing recreational activities</text>
  <text start="3153" dur="5.67">and then you end up meeting men or women</text>
  <text start="3155.85" dur="4.59">who like the same activities and then</text>
  <text start="3158.67" dur="5.75">you have you know extramarital affairs</text>
  <text start="3160.44" dur="7.23">and stuff like that whole concept of</text>
  <text start="3164.42" dur="7.03">independent behavior is that it puts you</text>
  <text start="3167.67" dur="6.06">at risk of eventually separating from</text>
  <text start="3171.45" dur="4.92">your spouse and one of the things that</text>
  <text start="3173.73" dur="5.34">my wife and I do is the same thing you</text>
  <text start="3176.37" dur="4.23">and Shannon do whenever I want to spend</text>
  <text start="3179.07" dur="3.93">money on something or do something go</text>
  <text start="3180.6" dur="4.02">somewhere I always think you know is</text>
  <text start="3183" dur="3.81">this something that she would approve of</text>
  <text start="3184.62" dur="4.05">a lot of times I&amp;#39;ll text or call her and</text>
  <text start="3186.81" dur="3.78">say hey I&amp;#39;m thinking about getting this</text>
  <text start="3188.67" dur="4.32">or thinking about doing that so what do</text>
  <text start="3190.59" dur="5.13">you think what do you think and if she</text>
  <text start="3192.99" dur="4.47">she always has the right of refusal she</text>
  <text start="3195.72" dur="4.2">can say nope I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a good</text>
  <text start="3197.46" dur="5.28">idea and it&amp;#39;s done I don&amp;#39;t do it won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3199.92" dur="5.61">buy it it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a done deal</text>
  <text start="3202.74" dur="4.74">we just do not engage an independent</text>
  <text start="3205.53" dur="3.69">behavior and some people will say you</text>
  <text start="3207.48" dur="3.18">know well you know your wife wears the</text>
  <text start="3209.22" dur="2.91">pants in the family she has you wrapped</text>
  <text start="3210.66" dur="4.52">around her fingers you can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="3212.13" dur="5.46">without her permission well the thing is</text>
  <text start="3215.18" dur="3.79">she does the same thing for me she</text>
  <text start="3217.59" dur="3.42">doesn&amp;#39;t go out and buy stuff she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3218.97" dur="4.55">go out go places and you know things</text>
  <text start="3221.01" dur="5.22">without consulting me and asking me or</text>
  <text start="3223.52" dur="4.99">considering you know how I feel about it</text>
  <text start="3226.23" dur="5.52">because if the two really do become one</text>
  <text start="3228.51" dur="5.97">you think is one you act as one you love</text>
  <text start="3231.75" dur="5.72">is one you spend money as one and that</text>
  <text start="3234.48" dur="5.49">really builds an amazing marriage</text>
  <text start="3237.47" dur="4.33">hundred percent that&amp;#39;s cool it&amp;#39;s cool to</text>
  <text start="3239.97" dur="3.75">hear they all operate that way because I</text>
  <text start="3241.8" dur="5.43">mean that&amp;#39;s basically our kind of modus</text>
  <text start="3243.72" dur="7.53">operandi it&amp;#39;s funny because that leads</text>
  <text start="3247.23" dur="6.51">to another rabbit trail but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3251.25" dur="4.89">attached oh and real fast before I say</text>
  <text start="3253.74" dur="5.31">that another thing that that we do that</text>
  <text start="3256.14" dur="5.85">I that I don&amp;#39;t necessarily say everyone</text>
  <text start="3259.05" dur="4.68">should do but it&amp;#39;s benefited us we go to</text>
  <text start="3261.99" dur="3.81">bed at the same time every single night</text>
  <text start="3263.73" dur="4.02">we go to bed together that&amp;#39;s slightly I</text>
  <text start="3265.8" dur="3.18">love it it&amp;#39;s just I don&amp;#39;t know what it</text>
  <text start="3267.75" dur="5.43">is about it it&amp;#39;s just been very</text>
  <text start="3268.98" dur="7.5">beneficial for us and I am NOT a small</text>
  <text start="3273.18" dur="5.25">dude I roll over every night and pin her</text>
  <text start="3276.48" dur="7.35">down with my arm and she&amp;#39;s trapped and I</text>
  <text start="3278.43" dur="6.54">fall asleep in 15 she can&amp;#39;t escape no</text>
  <text start="3283.83" dur="4.02">Bert but you mentioned about the</text>
  <text start="3284.97" dur="6.33">independent behavior so her and I had</text>
  <text start="3287.85" dur="7.73">this discussion because I think as we</text>
  <text start="3291.3" dur="7.95">develop and in our marriage um I think</text>
  <text start="3295.58" dur="6.7">we were more solidified and our oneness</text>
  <text start="3299.25" dur="4.68">together as a team so we so we I think</text>
  <text start="3302.28" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re doing a really good job of taking</text>
  <text start="3303.93" dur="4.65">each other into consideration and things</text>
  <text start="3307.05" dur="3.75">like that but at the same time we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3308.58" dur="5.69">developing interests that are outside of</text>
  <text start="3310.8" dur="7.49">each other and so like Shannon does a</text>
  <text start="3314.27" dur="7.36">book club once a month she does a</text>
  <text start="3318.29" dur="5.77">women&amp;#39;s gathering me she does a lot of</text>
  <text start="3321.63" dur="6.15">stuff with women and she&amp;#39;s the leader</text>
  <text start="3324.06" dur="5.76">cuz she&amp;#39;s a very strong leader and so I</text>
  <text start="3327.78" dur="5.31">love seeing her do that that has nothing</text>
  <text start="3329.82" dur="5.58">to do with me my job with all that is to</text>
  <text start="3333.09" dur="4.8">watch the our boys right don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="3335.4" dur="3.81">support her ability to do that yes so so</text>
  <text start="3337.89" dur="2.729">therefore that&amp;#39;s not I guess you would</text>
  <text start="3339.21" dur="5.06">say that&amp;#39;s not independent behavior</text>
  <text start="3340.619" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s teamwork right I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3344.27" dur="4.48">actually okay yeah I&amp;#39;m with you yeah</text>
  <text start="3347.369" dur="4.321">it&amp;#39;s not that you don&amp;#39;t do things</text>
  <text start="3348.75" dur="5.16">together it&amp;#39;s that you&amp;#39;re lying you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3351.69" dur="4.919">approving of and supporting what she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3353.91" dur="5.04">doing right and she&amp;#39;s approved Evan</text>
  <text start="3356.609" dur="3.45">supports what you&amp;#39;re doing I mean my</text>
  <text start="3358.95" dur="2.759">wife and I are the same way she</text>
  <text start="3360.059" dur="2.91">has interests and hobbies that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3361.709" dur="4.05">actually i&amp;#39;m not actually actively</text>
  <text start="3362.969" dur="4.35">involved in but i&amp;#39;m doing things in the</text>
  <text start="3365.759" dur="4.08">background to support what she&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="3367.319" dur="4.2">correct and you know and you know that</text>
  <text start="3369.839" dur="3.66">in your heart where if there was any</text>
  <text start="3371.519" dur="5.82">sort of resentment about the activities</text>
  <text start="3373.499" dur="7.23">i&amp;#39;ll just cut it off yeah yes and our</text>
  <text start="3377.339" dur="6.77">favorite thing to do is date night once</text>

  <text start="3757.01" dur="2.82">thing that we have to wrap our minds</text>
  <text start="3758.21" dur="3.54">around as God is not going to do stuff</text>
