  <text start="8.84" dur="5.259">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="4.91">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="2.601">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="18.03" dur="3.82">hey everybody this is praying medic how</text>
  <text start="20.86" dur="3.54">are you doing I hope you&amp;#39;re having a</text>
  <text start="21.85" dur="5.61">good day I want to talk to you today</text>
  <text start="24.4" dur="4.98">about a couple of things actually the</text>
  <text start="27.46" dur="5.19">first thing I&amp;#39;d like to talk to you</text>
  <text start="29.38" dur="5.4">about is a question I received from</text>
  <text start="32.65" dur="6.15">someone who&amp;#39;s been following my website</text>
  <text start="34.78" dur="7.38">for a while and they asked me to talk a</text>
  <text start="38.8" dur="5.52">little bit about what my daily devotion</text>
  <text start="42.16" dur="4.26">looks like what my time with God looks</text>
  <text start="44.32" dur="3.51">like the fellow asks you know when you</text>
  <text start="46.42" dur="2.91">spend time alone with God what does that</text>
  <text start="47.83" dur="3.42">look like how do you connect with God</text>
  <text start="49.33" dur="4.14">how do you hear his voice how do you</text>
  <text start="51.25" dur="4.14">fellowship with God but I thought as</text>
  <text start="53.47" dur="3.18">long as I&amp;#39;m on the subject I might as</text>
  <text start="55.39" dur="3.839">well talk about a couple of related</text>
  <text start="56.65" dur="6.24">topics the other thing I want to talk</text>
  <text start="59.229" dur="6.601">about is church attendance and the third</text>
  <text start="62.89" dur="6.06">thing I&amp;#39;d like to talk about is my idea</text>
  <text start="65.83" dur="5.64">of what it means to worship God I am</text>
  <text start="68.95" dur="4.59">going to warn you I have some views that</text>
  <text start="71.47" dur="4.079">are a little non-traditional</text>
  <text start="73.54" dur="3.95">I wouldn&amp;#39;t say they&amp;#39;re controversial but</text>
  <text start="75.549" dur="4.201">they might be and I don&amp;#39;t hold</text>
  <text start="77.49" dur="4.39">controversial views just because I like</text>
  <text start="79.75" dur="4.56">to be a rebel like everyone else my</text>
  <text start="81.88" dur="5.04">views and practices came out of my past</text>
  <text start="84.31" dur="5.339">experiences and they&amp;#39;re unique to me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="86.92" dur="6.059">not endorsing them as the right way to</text>
  <text start="89.649" dur="5.43">do things I&amp;#39;m not suggesting that this</text>
  <text start="92.979" dur="4.95">is how you should do it but people</text>
  <text start="95.079" dur="4.411">wanted to know so I&amp;#39;m gonna share some</text>
  <text start="97.929" dur="4.98">of my ideas today but when you first</text>
  <text start="99.49" dur="5.76">meet somebody a stranger and you start</text>
  <text start="102.909" dur="4.831">talking about God and they find out oh</text>
  <text start="105.25" dur="5.34">hey you&amp;#39;re a believer too what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="107.74" dur="5.519">first question they ask what church do</text>
  <text start="110.59" dur="4.139">you go to right for some people you</text>
  <text start="113.259" dur="2.82">might as well ask them if they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="114.729" dur="5.46">stopped beating their wife</text>
  <text start="116.079" dur="7.441">what church a person goes to is not as</text>
  <text start="120.189" dur="7.761">easy a question to answer as you might</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="8.4">think our Western culture has made it a</text>
  <text start="127.95" dur="6.43">practice and a standard that you have to</text>
  <text start="131.92" dur="4.44">live up to in a sense that if you are a</text>
  <text start="134.38" dur="2.73">believer you have to go to church</text>
  <text start="136.36" dur="2.459">regularly</text>
  <text start="137.11" dur="3.48">when believers meet each other for the</text>
  <text start="138.819" dur="3.301">first time one of the things they always</text>
  <text start="140.59" dur="4.229">ask is hey what church you go to</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="5.58">I have around 3,000 friends on Facebook</text>
  <text start="144.819" dur="6.271">and another 5,000 were following me and</text>
  <text start="147.7" dur="6.149">I would say probably 75 person</text>
  <text start="151.09" dur="5.46">of the people who are connected with me</text>
  <text start="153.849" dur="3.991">on Facebook do not attend church</text>
  <text start="156.55" dur="3.39">services regularly</text>
  <text start="157.84" dur="4.259">I call them church dropouts that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="159.94" dur="5.519">actually what I call myself and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="162.099" dur="6.811">that we have walked away from God lost</text>
  <text start="165.459" dur="6.771">our interest in God for many of us what</text>
  <text start="168.91" dur="6.57">we found is that being in a church</text>
  <text start="172.23" dur="5.38">traditional church experience going into</text>
  <text start="175.48" dur="4.05">a building you know one day a week or</text>
  <text start="177.61" dur="5.159">two days a week devoting our time to</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="5.7">that has not strengthened our</text>
  <text start="182.769" dur="6.121">relationship with God it hasn&amp;#39;t advanced</text>
  <text start="185.23" dur="5.49">the kingdom in a significant way and for</text>
  <text start="188.89" dur="3.39">many of us we&amp;#39;ve done it for a while we</text>
  <text start="190.72" dur="3.329">grew to a certain point and then there</text>
  <text start="192.28" dur="4.56">was nothing there for us that would</text>
  <text start="194.049" dur="5.671">continue the growth process so we were</text>
  <text start="196.84" dur="5.67">led to fellowship and hang out with</text>
  <text start="199.72" dur="5.01">people in other venues and many of us</text>
  <text start="202.51" dur="4.8">are not attending regular church</text>
  <text start="204.73" dur="4.08">services and that is a hard thing for a</text>
  <text start="207.31" dur="4.47">lot of people to wrap their mind around</text>
  <text start="208.81" dur="5.759">I have a lot of friends who do go to</text>
  <text start="211.78" dur="5.82">church services every week and they love</text>
  <text start="214.569" dur="4.531">it and it&amp;#39;s great actually my wife says</text>
  <text start="217.6" dur="4.139">the one thing that she does miss about</text>
  <text start="219.1" dur="3.24">going to weekly church services is the</text>
  <text start="221.739" dur="3.511">corporate worship</text>
  <text start="222.34" dur="4.25">she misses that and it is something that</text>
  <text start="225.25" dur="4.44">she would like to put back in her life</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="4.36">about seven or eight years ago after I</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="4.379">got kicked out of the church I was</text>
  <text start="230.95" dur="5.22">attending the Lord gave me a series of</text>
  <text start="234.069" dur="5.221">dreams that were very powerful and very</text>
  <text start="236.17" dur="6.78">instructive and he made it very clear to</text>
  <text start="239.29" dur="7.259">me that he intended to use me outside of</text>
  <text start="242.95" dur="6.75">the regular Sunday church services now I</text>
  <text start="246.549" dur="5.401">had a hard time with that at first and I</text>
  <text start="249.7" dur="4.68">was disobedient we looked for another</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="4.89">church we went to another church we</text>
  <text start="254.38" dur="4.889">attended several churches actually at</text>
  <text start="256.84" dur="5.97">the time in Washington and found some</text>
  <text start="259.269" dur="5.731">great churches learned a lot connected</text>
  <text start="262.81" dur="5.669">with a lot of people but the Lord kept</text>
  <text start="265" dur="6.57">speaking to me letting me know in very</text>
  <text start="268.479" dur="4.831">clear terms his plan was to use me</text>
  <text start="271.57" dur="3.9">outside of the building the sunday</text>
  <text start="273.31" dur="3.81">meetings I struggled for a few years to</text>
  <text start="275.47" dur="3.72">understand what that looked like and</text>
  <text start="277.12" dur="6.54">then when Denise and I moved to Arizona</text>
  <text start="279.19" dur="6.84">five years ago since we&amp;#39;ve moved here</text>
  <text start="283.66" dur="5.88">we have not found a regular church to</text>
  <text start="286.03" dur="4.95">attend and I stopped looking a couple of</text>
  <text start="289.54" dur="3.87">months ago I was able to teach at that</text>
  <text start="290.98" dur="4.83">Southwest School of Supernatural and I</text>
  <text start="293.41" dur="5.7">did run into a church near where I live</text>
  <text start="295.81" dur="5.43">that seems really cool the leadership I</text>
  <text start="299.11" dur="3.84">got to meet them it seemed like really</text>
  <text start="301.24" dur="4.14">nice people without a lot of control</text>
  <text start="302.95" dur="6.06">issues they invited us to come there and</text>
  <text start="305.38" dur="5.88">teach the worship was pretty awesome we</text>
  <text start="309.01" dur="4.29">could feel God&amp;#39;s presence there it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="311.26" dur="4.62">possible we may end up attending there</text>
  <text start="313.3" dur="4.98">in the future but for now the Lord is</text>
  <text start="315.88" dur="4.53">still indicating that he plans to use me</text>
  <text start="318.28" dur="4.41">mostly outside of the regular church</text>
  <text start="320.41" dur="3.69">meetings when people ask me you know</text>
  <text start="322.69" dur="2.64">well you don&amp;#39;t go to church how do you</text>
  <text start="324.1" dur="2.58">fellowship with people you know the</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="3.6">Bible says you&amp;#39;re supposed to fellowship</text>
  <text start="326.68" dur="4.53">with people what some people don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="328.93" dur="4.74">is I get more fellowship with other</text>
  <text start="331.21" dur="5.76">believers than most of the full-time</text>
  <text start="333.67" dur="5.64">pastors that I know over the last seven</text>
  <text start="336.97" dur="4.89">years I&amp;#39;ve probably spent an average of</text>
  <text start="339.31" dur="5.04">between 40 and 60 hours a week</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="4.86">connecting with believers on Facebook</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="5.64">and some other social media platforms as</text>
  <text start="346.72" dur="5.52">well but mostly through Facebook I&amp;#39;m the</text>
  <text start="349.99" dur="4.08">administrator of probably half a dozen</text>
  <text start="352.24" dur="4.83">different groups on Facebook prayer</text>
  <text start="354.07" dur="4.59">groups prophetic groups training and</text>
  <text start="357.07" dur="5.13">equipping I&amp;#39;m always putting out</text>
  <text start="358.66" dur="5.67">information for people on healing and</text>
  <text start="362.2" dur="4.14">prophecy and hearing God&amp;#39;s voice I</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="4.5">receive a lot of prayer requests to</text>
  <text start="366.34" dur="4.74">private messages a lot of questions that</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="4.56">people have it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m not around</text>
  <text start="371.08" dur="5.91">other believers in being built up I have</text>
  <text start="373.39" dur="5.31">a strong group of friends and we stay</text>
  <text start="376.99" dur="4.44">connected we talk about the Lord we</text>
  <text start="378.7" dur="7.41">learn and grow together it is every bit</text>
  <text start="381.43" dur="7.71">as vibrant fellowship for me as anything</text>
  <text start="386.11" dur="6.15">else it&amp;#39;s out there and it is the main</text>
  <text start="389.14" dur="6.18">way in which I connect with the people</text>
  <text start="392.26" dur="4.62">of God I don&amp;#39;t know what God has planned</text>
  <text start="395.32" dur="5.19">for me in the future but for right now</text>
  <text start="396.88" dur="6.03">and for the last few years he has really</text>
  <text start="400.51" dur="4.62">done some amazing work through me and in</text>
  <text start="402.91" dur="5.46">our circle of friends on social media</text>
  <text start="405.13" dur="5.73">and like I said I&amp;#39;m not criticizing</text>
  <text start="408.37" dur="6">people who attend regular worship</text>
  <text start="410.86" dur="5.04">services on the weekends if that is what</text>
  <text start="414.37" dur="3.15">builds you up if that&amp;#39;s what strengthens</text>
  <text start="415.9" dur="4.199">you if you get trained and equipped</text>
  <text start="417.52" dur="4.38">doing that you should keep doing it but</text>
  <text start="420.099" dur="4.35">you know the Lord has a different plan</text>
  <text start="421.9" dur="3.69">for some of us so be kind and be</text>
  <text start="424.449" dur="4.021">considerate when you talk to other</text>
  <text start="425.59" dur="4.41">believers who are maybe not attending</text>
  <text start="428.47" dur="3.33">church services there are some good</text>
  <text start="430" dur="4.53">reasons why people stop attending</text>
  <text start="431.8" dur="4.2">regular church services the second thing</text>
  <text start="434.53" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;d like to talk about today is my</text>
  <text start="436" dur="4.8">spiritual routine my daily walk with God</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="4.049">what that looks like I was listening to</text>
  <text start="440.8" dur="4.13">a Mike Parsons message a couple nights</text>
  <text start="443.169" dur="5.071">ago and when I listened to Mike talk</text>
  <text start="444.93" dur="7.6">sometimes it makes me feel a little bit</text>
  <text start="448.24" dur="7.53">embarrassed because Mike has an</text>
  <text start="452.53" dur="6.66">incredible walk with God he is a rather</text>
  <text start="455.77" dur="5.429">disciplined person he has certain</text>
  <text start="459.19" dur="3.87">devotional times that he sets aside</text>
  <text start="461.199" dur="5.19">every day gets up early in the morning</text>
  <text start="463.06" dur="6.03">bends time with God he does what he</text>
  <text start="466.389" dur="5.551">calls he opens his first love gate which</text>
  <text start="469.09" dur="6.02">is a way that he deepens his connection</text>
  <text start="471.94" dur="6.42">with God and he spends time focusing on</text>
  <text start="475.11" dur="5.89">what he&amp;#39;s going to do that day what what</text>
  <text start="478.36" dur="3.869">the Lord and him are going to colabor</text>
  <text start="481" dur="3.509">and what they&amp;#39;re going to accomplish</text>
  <text start="482.229" dur="4.861">each day and does this every day I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="484.509" dur="5.431">sure how much time he spends doing that</text>
  <text start="487.09" dur="5.639">and many people have daily routines</text>
  <text start="489.94" dur="4.62">where they&amp;#39;ll get up in the morning or</text>
  <text start="492.729" dur="3.961">you know if you work nights you might</text>
  <text start="494.56" dur="4.109">get up in the afternoon spend some time</text>
  <text start="496.69" dur="4.469">with the Lord maybe play some worship</text>
  <text start="498.669" dur="5.521">music come into his presence try to</text>
  <text start="501.159" dur="5.551">sense what he is saying what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="504.19" dur="5.43">for a lot of people they&amp;#39;ll spend time</text>
  <text start="506.71" dur="6.269">in worship put on some music and I have</text>
  <text start="509.62" dur="5.849">a friend William Waring who asked me a</text>
  <text start="512.979" dur="5.761">while back what kind of music do you</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="7.86">like to soak to and I wrote back I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="518.74" dur="7.17">soak I used to but I don&amp;#39;t anymore and</text>
  <text start="523.329" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;m not even sure why there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="525.91" dur="4.169">wrong with playing soaking music and</text>
  <text start="527.709" dur="5.13">spending time in the Lord&amp;#39;s presence and</text>
  <text start="530.079" dur="4.351">I think it&amp;#39;s great you take trips into</text>
  <text start="532.839" dur="3.99">the heavens and you meet with angels and</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="3.36">you can travel around the world and pray</text>
  <text start="536.829" dur="2.971">for people to be healed</text>
  <text start="537.79" dur="5.25">I think soaking is is a good practice</text>
  <text start="539.8" dur="5.46">put on some great music and get lost in</text>
  <text start="543.04" dur="5.58">the spiritual world I think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="545.26" dur="5.22">great thing to do it&amp;#39;s probably a good</text>
  <text start="548.62" dur="2.79">discipline it&amp;#39;s not something I do</text>
  <text start="550.48" dur="5.789">myself</text>
  <text start="551.41" dur="8.549">my routine my spiritual walk with God is</text>
  <text start="556.269" dur="6.18">actually fairly boring and mundane and</text>
  <text start="559.959" dur="4.89">I&amp;#39;m not saying that to be humble or</text>
  <text start="562.449" dur="5.16">anything I&amp;#39;m just being real if he</text>
  <text start="564.849" dur="4.621">followed me around an average 24 hour a</text>
  <text start="567.609" dur="3.78">day you wouldn&amp;#39;t find anything in my</text>
  <text start="569.47" dur="5.429">life it&amp;#39;s exceptionally spiritual</text>
  <text start="571.389" dur="5.37">looking I spend my days very much like</text>
  <text start="574.899" dur="3.42">an unbeliever does probably if you</text>
  <text start="576.759" dur="3.63">looked at someone who doesn&amp;#39;t know God</text>
  <text start="578.319" dur="3.84">and he looked at what I do you probably</text>
  <text start="580.389" dur="4.26">wouldn&amp;#39;t see much difference between our</text>
  <text start="582.159" dur="4.38">lifestyles I get up in the morning now</text>
  <text start="584.649" dur="6.24">that I&amp;#39;m not working on the ambulance</text>
  <text start="586.539" dur="6">I&amp;#39;m a full-time writer my wife is made</text>
  <text start="590.889" dur="3.15">sure to let me know that I am NOT</text>
  <text start="592.539" dur="3">retired I&amp;#39;m still working</text>
  <text start="594.039" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;m just not working on the ambulance</text>
  <text start="595.539" dur="5.55">anymore so I get up in the morning and</text>
  <text start="598.299" dur="5.671">that could be anywhere from 3 o&amp;#39;clock in</text>
  <text start="601.089" dur="6.36">the morning if I&amp;#39;ve had a dream or 3:30</text>
  <text start="603.97" dur="7.589">or 4 usually I will write down my dreams</text>
  <text start="607.449" dur="6.33">and sometimes I spend way too much time</text>

  <text start="842.209" dur="4.591">doing what they&amp;#39;re hearing from God</text>
  <text start="843.589" dur="5.131">really my way to know what God is</text>
  <text start="846.8" dur="4.8">talking about what he&amp;#39;s doing in a large</text>
  <text start="848.72" dur="3.239">part comes by reading the websites and</text>
  <text start="851.6" dur="3.87">blogs</text>
  <text start="851.959" dur="6.271">of my friends for me that&amp;#39;s a big way to</text>
  <text start="855.47" dur="5.01">know what God is saying nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="858.23" dur="4.38">with spending time alone listening to</text>
  <text start="860.48" dur="5.49">God but I have a lot of prophetic</text>
  <text start="862.61" dur="5.519">friends and when I have a dream or a</text>
  <text start="865.97" dur="3.96">series of dreams about a certain subject</text>
  <text start="868.129" dur="3.75">many times I want to know is God</text>
  <text start="869.93" dur="4.889">speaking about this to anyone else and</text>
  <text start="871.879" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s surprising how often - I will start</text>
  <text start="874.819" dur="3.39">reading the websites of my friends and</text>
  <text start="876.529" dur="4.471">see the same subject being written about</text>
  <text start="878.209" dur="4.38">by somebody and then a few days later</text>
  <text start="881" dur="3.99">somebody else writes a particle on the</text>
  <text start="882.589" dur="4.23">same subject and then when I do that I</text>
  <text start="884.99" dur="5.13">start to realize okay God is definitely</text>
  <text start="886.819" dur="6.111">talking about this subject so I think</text>
  <text start="890.12" dur="5.339">it&amp;#39;s valuable to spend time not just</text>
  <text start="892.93" dur="4.209">trying to discern what God is saying to</text>
  <text start="895.459" dur="4.86">you but what is he saying to other</text>
  <text start="897.139" dur="4.92">people so I&amp;#39;ll do that for a while in</text>
  <text start="900.319" dur="4.591">the morning go get some more coffee make</text>
  <text start="902.059" dur="5.13">some breakfast and unlike a lot of</text>

  <text start="919.129" dur="3.9">a lot of times there&amp;#39;s birds flying</text>

  <text start="923.029" dur="4.55">birds and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a pretty relaxing</text>
  <text start="925.639" dur="4.14">atmosphere in our house in the morning</text>
  <text start="927.579" dur="4.45">Denise will get up and she&amp;#39;ll start</text>
  <text start="929.779" dur="3.75">doing her stuff and now this morning I</text>
  <text start="932.029" dur="4.441">was kind of surprised</text>
  <text start="933.529" dur="4.5">right after we had coffee she grabbed</text>

  <text start="974.819" dur="7.38">God commences I found some time ago that</text>
  <text start="979.259" dur="6.45">God speaks to people in different ways</text>
  <text start="982.199" dur="6.63">God inspires and speaks to Denise</text>
  <text start="985.709" dur="5.31">while she&amp;#39;s painting she is a creative</text>
  <text start="988.829" dur="6.12">person God created her to be an artist</text>
  <text start="991.019" dur="7.591">has given her artistic talent and she</text>
  <text start="994.949" dur="6.06">paints and God speaks to her and gives</text>

  <text start="1030.709" dur="4.95">Spirit it&amp;#39;s an unspoken discussion but I</text>
  <text start="1033.37" dur="4.569">just direct my thoughts towards the Lord</text>
  <text start="1035.659" dur="3.63">and I say okay Lord I want to come up</text>
  <text start="1037.939" dur="3.571">with an outline for this book what is</text>
  <text start="1039.289" dur="4.91">what is it going to look like so I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1041.51" dur="4.889">have this thought and I&amp;#39;ll write it down</text>

  <text start="1063.95" dur="5.729">bullet points that he wants me to cover</text>
  <text start="1066.47" dur="5.61">in a book so he might say look first</text>
  <text start="1069.679" dur="3.901">let&amp;#39;s cover the biblical basis for this</text>
  <text start="1072.08" dur="3.39">idea because the first thing people are</text>
  <text start="1073.58" dur="3.87">gonna wanna know is is this in the Bible</text>
  <text start="1075.47" dur="4.14">so I&amp;#39;ll write that down as bullet point</text>
  <text start="1077.45" dur="4.14">number one then he&amp;#39;ll say well you have</text>
  <text start="1079.61" dur="4.77">some testimonies so put that down as a</text>
  <text start="1081.59" dur="4.92">bullet point so testimonies come in</text>
  <text start="1084.38" dur="3.6">and then he&amp;#39;ll say well you remember</text>
  <text start="1086.51" dur="2.159">those dreams that I gave you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1087.98" dur="2.49">forget those</text>
  <text start="1088.669" dur="4.5">so there&amp;#39;s another bullet point okay</text>
  <text start="1090.47" dur="6.3">talk about my dreams so this is how the</text>
  <text start="1093.169" dur="5.521">Lord gives me revelation about how to</text>
  <text start="1096.77" dur="3.8">write a book how to outline it like I</text>
  <text start="1098.69" dur="5.45">said as I sit down on my computer I</text>
  <text start="1100.57" dur="7.15">start writing and I turn my thoughts</text>
  <text start="1104.14" dur="6.97">toward what I want to do and the Lord</text>
  <text start="1107.72" dur="5.79">just starts speaking to me through my</text>
  <text start="1111.11" dur="5.37">thoughts through my conscience through</text>
  <text start="1113.51" dur="6.72">visions that I see in my mind that is</text>
  <text start="1116.48" dur="5.34">how I connect with God if you know a</text>

  <text start="1127.46" dur="7.44">write and he has found that and and this</text>
  <text start="1131.39" dur="6.51">goes to the third question which is how</text>
  <text start="1134.9" dur="6.18">do we worship God I know there are a lot</text>
  <text start="1137.9" dur="7.23">of people who feel like worshipping God</text>
  <text start="1141.08" dur="6.44">is equivalent to singing songs of praise</text>
  <text start="1145.13" dur="5.25">and worship to God and that is</text>
  <text start="1147.52" dur="5.17">worshiping God but it&amp;#39;s not the only way</text>
  <text start="1150.38" dur="3.87">to worship God there I think there are</text>
  <text start="1152.69" dur="5.43">many different ways we can worship God</text>
  <text start="1154.25" dur="6.9">and I think the way a particular person</text>
  <text start="1158.12" dur="5.28">worships God is unique to them like I</text>

  <text start="1292.769" dur="5.731">most frequent complaints I received from</text>
  <text start="1295.559" dur="5.941">people is that they don&amp;#39;t know their</text>
  <text start="1298.5" dur="6.059">destiny they don&amp;#39;t know really what God</text>
  <text start="1301.5" dur="5.82">has created them to do and that is a</text>
  <text start="1304.559" dur="6.6">very frustrating thing but I have found</text>
  <text start="1307.32" dur="7.189">that the things that God has created us</text>
  <text start="1311.159" dur="7.051">to do are not usually as mysterious as</text>
  <text start="1314.509" dur="5.441">we think they&amp;#39;re sometimes they are in</text>

  <text start="1319.95" dur="4.559">writing it&amp;#39;s not a terribly exciting</text>
  <text start="1322.289" dur="3.75">thing for a lot of people but I enjoy</text>
  <text start="1324.509" dur="4.591">doing it I&amp;#39;ve always enjoyed doing it I</text>
  <text start="1326.039" dur="5.52">never knew that it was part of my divine</text>
  <text start="1329.1" dur="5.039">destiny until a few years ago when my</text>
  <text start="1331.559" dur="4.801">wife confronted me and said don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1334.139" dur="3.75">realize God made you to be a writer and</text>
  <text start="1336.36" dur="1.919">I thought that&amp;#39;s the dumbest thing I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1337.889" dur="3.42">ever heard</text>
  <text start="1338.279" dur="5.671">but when I started to look at back at my</text>
  <text start="1341.309" dur="4.47">life I realized I always have enjoyed</text>
  <text start="1343.95" dur="3.719">writing just never thought I could make</text>
  <text start="1345.779" dur="3.63">a career out of it or never thought that</text>
  <text start="1347.669" dur="3.501">I would write in a way that would</text>
  <text start="1349.409" dur="5.991">inspire and bless other people</text>
  <text start="1351.17" dur="6.69">and as I started to obey that as I</text>
  <text start="1355.4" dur="7.13">started to ask God okay what does that</text>
  <text start="1357.86" dur="8.34">look like he started to show me what my</text>
  <text start="1362.53" dur="5.5">destiny has a writer looks like and I</text>
  <text start="1366.2" dur="3.81">think the same thing is true for a lot</text>
  <text start="1368.03" dur="4.17">of you you probably already doing</text>
  <text start="1370.01" dur="4.59">something that you really enjoy doing or</text>
  <text start="1372.2" dur="4.01">in the past you have enjoyed doing</text>
  <text start="1374.6" dur="3.75">something and then gave it up because</text>
  <text start="1376.21" dur="4.36">someone told you you couldn&amp;#39;t make a</text>
  <text start="1378.35" dur="3.96">living doing it or it wasn&amp;#39;t your</text>
  <text start="1380.57" dur="3.87">calling or you were destined to do</text>
  <text start="1382.31" dur="5.28">something else but you still have that</text>
  <text start="1384.44" dur="6.6">passion to do that thing whatever your</text>
  <text start="1387.59" dur="5.67">passion in life is when you do something</text>
  <text start="1391.04" dur="4.98">that brings you great joy great pleasure</text>
  <text start="1393.26" dur="4.62">great satisfaction it&amp;#39;s very likely that</text>
  <text start="1396.02" dur="4.19">the thing that you&amp;#39;re doing that gives</text>
  <text start="1397.88" dur="5.61">you great joy pleasure and satisfaction</text>
  <text start="1400.21" dur="6.31">also gives God joy pleasure and</text>
  <text start="1403.49" dur="5.58">satisfaction when you do it when you tap</text>
  <text start="1406.52" dur="5.28">into the thing that God has created you</text>
  <text start="1409.07" dur="4.92">to do so with my friend Ginny Wilcox</text>
  <text start="1411.8" dur="4.23">she loves to bake and she&amp;#39;s really good</text>
  <text start="1413.99" dur="3.96">at it and she has an Etsy shop called</text>
  <text start="1416.03" dur="4.79">Gigi&amp;#39;s table she doesn&amp;#39;t just baked</text>
  <text start="1417.95" dur="5.04">goodies and send them out to people she</text>
  <text start="1420.82" dur="4.66">corresponds with the people that she</text>
  <text start="1422.99" dur="4.38">sells the bakery - and she ministers to</text>
  <text start="1425.48" dur="3.87">them and she prays for them and she</text>
  <text start="1427.37" dur="3.87">encourages them that is part of her</text>
  <text start="1429.35" dur="4.14">ministry that is what she&amp;#39;s called and</text>
  <text start="1431.24" dur="4.2">destined to do now you wouldn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1433.49" dur="5.07">that someone&amp;#39;s you know divine destiny</text>
  <text start="1435.44" dur="5.01">could be baking cookies and crescents</text>
  <text start="1438.56" dur="3.81">and sending them out to people across</text>
  <text start="1440.45" dur="3.87">the country but I think that actually is</text>
  <text start="1442.37" dur="2.64">part of her destiny and calling it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1444.32" dur="2.52">it&amp;#39;s her gift</text>
  <text start="1445.01" dur="3.6">it may seem very mundane it may seem</text>
  <text start="1446.84" dur="4.08">weird it&amp;#39;s not standing on a platform</text>
  <text start="1448.61" dur="4.5">with a microphone and preaching two</text>
  <text start="1450.92" dur="4.26">hundred thousand people but she loves</text>
  <text start="1453.11" dur="4.23">doing it she&amp;#39;s very good at it and she</text>
  <text start="1455.18" dur="3.75">finally figured out that that is what</text>
  <text start="1457.34" dur="4.88">God has called her to do so she&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="1458.93" dur="5.94">it and I think for a lot of us we</text>
  <text start="1462.22" dur="4.81">probably overlook the everyday things</text>
  <text start="1464.87" dur="4.65">that that the Lord can take great</text>
  <text start="1467.03" dur="4.8">pleasure and joy and watching us do I</text>
  <text start="1469.52" dur="4.17">know that when I&amp;#39;m writing it gives the</text>
  <text start="1471.83" dur="4.56">Lord a lot of pleasure it gives him joy</text>
  <text start="1473.69" dur="5.31">to watch me doing what he created me to</text>
  <text start="1476.39" dur="5.37">do there is nothing gives the Lord</text>
  <text start="1479" dur="5.7">greater joy and greater pleasure than</text>
  <text start="1481.76" dur="5.37">watching his kids do the things</text>
  <text start="1484.7" dur="4.89">they were created to do when we find our</text>
  <text start="1487.13" dur="4.74">destiny when we find our true calling</text>
  <text start="1489.59" dur="4.02">when we understand what it is we were</text>
  <text start="1491.87" dur="5.19">created to do and we start doing it</text>
  <text start="1493.61" dur="6.39">it gives him great pleasure it gives us</text>
  <text start="1497.06" dur="4.41">pleasure and to me that is the most</text>
  <text start="1500" dur="3.72">sincere form of worship</text>
  <text start="1501.47" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s simply doing the things God created</text>
