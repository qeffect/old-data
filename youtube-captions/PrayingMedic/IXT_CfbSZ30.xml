  <text start="4.049" dur="6.8">medic and this is my cue and on</text>
  <text start="6.029" dur="7.171">broadcast for Sunday November 3rd 2019</text>
  <text start="10.849" dur="4.87">those of you who are following along at</text>
  <text start="13.2" dur="5.04">home you can find Q posts on a number of</text>
  <text start="15.719" dur="5.251">different websites including Q map that</text>
  <text start="18.24" dur="5.52">pub and Q and on pub if you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="20.97" dur="5.85">for an Android app there are a couple of</text>
  <text start="23.76" dur="6.75">options Q map as one Q alerts is a</text>
  <text start="26.82" dur="7.25">second option if you have iOS and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="30.51" dur="6.69">looking for an app there you can still</text>
  <text start="34.07" dur="7.509">use the get pushed app and then search</text>
  <text start="37.2" dur="7.17">for the Qi on updates option that page</text>
  <text start="41.579" dur="6.991">however has not pulled the latest Q</text>
  <text start="44.37" dur="6.75">posts that were posted yesterday so</text>
  <text start="48.57" dur="5.489">eventually they will but not all the</text>
  <text start="51.12" dur="6.75">websites have have the current Q post</text>
  <text start="54.059" dur="6.75">showing my theme for this broadcast is</text>
  <text start="57.87" dur="6.569">ring for red and we&amp;#39;ll explain that in</text>
  <text start="60.809" dur="6.961">just a few minutes so Q has not posted</text>
  <text start="64.439" dur="6">since August 1st primarily because a</text>
  <text start="67.77" dur="6.599">chan has been offline since August 5th</text>
  <text start="70.439" dur="6.75">and that is where Q posted after they</text>
  <text start="74.369" dur="5.401">lost their tech support from CloudFlare</text>
  <text start="77.189" dur="4.921">the owner of H and Jim Watkins and code</text>
  <text start="79.77" dur="5.01">monkey developed a new platform called</text>
  <text start="82.11" dur="4.56">eight tune which they believe once they</text>
  <text start="84.78" dur="3.3">get all the software install the</text>
  <text start="86.67" dur="5.37">hardware installed and everything ready</text>
  <text start="88.08" dur="8.429">to go will be less susceptible to being</text>
  <text start="92.04" dur="7.41">taken offline and attacked so a coon</text>
  <text start="96.509" dur="5.851">went live yesterday morning and a few</text>
  <text start="99.45" dur="6.3">hours after went live I was monitoring</text>
  <text start="102.36" dur="7.43">it all day yesterday someone posted on</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="6.96">the Q research board using Q&amp;#39;s trip code</text>
  <text start="109.79" dur="5.32">naturally there is some concern over how</text>
  <text start="112.71" dur="5.159">we would know for certain that&amp;#39;s someone</text>
  <text start="115.11" dur="8.07">posting on a coon claiming to be Q is</text>
  <text start="117.869" dur="7.921">actually Q I am not 100% sure but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="123.18" dur="5.669">reasonably confident that the person who</text>
  <text start="125.79" dur="5.01">posted on 8q yesterday is actually Q and</text>
  <text start="128.849" dur="3.601">that&amp;#39;s partly based on the trip code</text>
  <text start="130.8" dur="2.15">they used partly based on some other</text>
  <text start="132.45" dur="3.83">things</text>
  <text start="132.95" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;ll talk about for those of you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="136.28" dur="6.72">know a trip code is a kind of password</text>
  <text start="138.83" dur="6.78">it can secure an online identity and it</text>
  <text start="143" dur="4.47">can identify an individual user but</text>
  <text start="145.61" dur="5.25">because it&amp;#39;s a hashed password</text>
  <text start="147.47" dur="5.13">it keeps the user anonymous so you have</text>
  <text start="150.86" dur="4.08">some identity some idea of who this</text>
  <text start="152.6" dur="4.139">person is at least it&amp;#39;s the consistent</text>
  <text start="154.94" dur="4.26">person as long as they don&amp;#39;t give their</text>
  <text start="156.739" dur="8.011">password to somebody else but it keeps</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="9.27">set entity anonymous right because the</text>
  <text start="164.75" dur="5.64">new Aitken website is not much more than</text>
  <text start="168.47" dur="4.739">just a new domain to host the boards</text>
  <text start="170.39" dur="5.22">that were previously hosted on HN a trip</text>
  <text start="173.209" dur="8.011">code that was created on HN will also</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="7.709">work on each coon so if we were</text>
  <text start="181.22" dur="5.7">reasonably confident of Q&amp;#39;s identity on</text>
  <text start="183.319" dur="6.931">HN because of the trip code then it</text>
  <text start="186.92" dur="5.399">seems logical we can be confident of Q&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.25" dur="5.48">identity or the identity of the person</text>
  <text start="192.319" dur="5.521">posting using Q&amp;#39;s trip code on a coon</text>
  <text start="195.73" dur="4.42">although I think it&amp;#39;s a good idea to</text>
  <text start="197.84" dur="4.23">evaluate other data to increase our</text>
  <text start="200.15" dur="4.589">confidence and I&amp;#39;ll give you some</text>
  <text start="202.07" dur="5.22">information that I&amp;#39;ve looked at that has</text>
  <text start="204.739" dur="7.831">given me more confidence that this is</text>
  <text start="207.29" dur="8.16">actually Q ok code monkey has been</text>
  <text start="212.57" dur="5.34">migrating boards from 8chan to eight</text>
  <text start="215.45" dur="5.099">Coon when he receives permission from</text>
  <text start="217.91" dur="5.76">the board owner fast Jack who is a board</text>
  <text start="220.549" dur="5.671">owner of Q research where Q has been</text>
  <text start="223.67" dur="5.01">posting gave permission for that board</text>
  <text start="226.22" dur="5.88">to be migrated so code monkey migrated</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="7.619">over and then this is a tweet from fast</text>
  <text start="232.1" dur="6.75">Jack eight Coon dotnet /q research is</text>
  <text start="236.299" dur="3.991">online and loading sit tight while code</text>
  <text start="238.85" dur="3.66">monkey and Jim get the massive amount of</text>
  <text start="240.29" dur="4.259">traffic under control in the meantime</text>
  <text start="242.51" dur="4.349">get the word out researchers Baker&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.549" dur="4.41">meme makers and other anons can start</text>
  <text start="246.859" dur="7.981">making the return home I&amp;#39;ll wait for new</text>
  <text start="248.959" dur="7.59">Q posts ok so a lot of people have been</text>
  <text start="254.84" dur="4.35">unable to find the Q research board on</text>
  <text start="256.549" dur="5.821">ate Coon that&amp;#39;s because the board is not</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="5.039">listed in the directory it is there but</text>
  <text start="262.37" dur="3.87">you need to know how to find it if</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="2.251">you&amp;#39;re in a non you probably won&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="266.24" dur="1.41">to</text>
  <text start="266.48" dur="2.91">much trouble finding it I have been</text>
  <text start="267.65" dur="5.43">noticing that morons are making it over</text>
  <text start="269.39" dur="5.85">there and posting I&amp;#39;m assuming that Q</text>
  <text start="273.08" dur="4.41">research is being hidden from the</text>
  <text start="275.24" dur="5.01">directory for a reason so I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="277.49" dur="4.35">to provide a link to it to the regular</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="7.01">location through normal browsers</text>
  <text start="281.84" dur="9.93">although code monkey has made the Tor</text>
  <text start="287.26" dur="6.34">link available below the regular web</text>
  <text start="291.77" dur="4.35">version of a coon has been really hard</text>
  <text start="293.6" dur="5.85">to access through normal browsers mostly</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="5.25">due to massive traffic load if you use</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="3.3">the tor browser which is easy enough to</text>
  <text start="301.37" dur="4.71">use you just download the tor browser</text>
  <text start="302.75" dur="6.03">and then put in the link and you&amp;#39;re good</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="6.93">to go I found it very easy to use it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="5.82">very stable and although I was trying to</text>
  <text start="313.01" dur="4.02">post last night from the tor browser I</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="5.16">wasn&amp;#39;t able to and what imagine at some</text>
  <text start="317.03" dur="4.35">point they&amp;#39;ll enable people using the</text>
  <text start="319.76" dur="4.98">tor browser to post but right now there</text>
  <text start="321.38" dur="6.99">they&amp;#39;re not it&amp;#39;s read-only so here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="324.74" dur="5.88">link and if you need more information on</text>
  <text start="328.37" dur="3.93">that you can go to code monkeys Twitter</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="4.77">page he&amp;#39;s got tons of information on</text>
  <text start="332.3" dur="5.82">other options for accessing it Coon if</text>
  <text start="335.39" dur="5.28">you need to access it can if you have</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="5.52">not used HN previously there probably</text>
  <text start="340.67" dur="5.94">isn&amp;#39;t a reason why you need to access a</text>
  <text start="343.64" dur="4.77">coon now Q&amp;#39;s posts are being displayed</text>
  <text start="346.61" dur="4.35">on most of the usual websites and mobile</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="5.01">apps and the additional traffic to a</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="5.49">coon is going to make it difficult for</text>
  <text start="353.42" dur="6.09">anyone to reach the website they they</text>
  <text start="356.45" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s been offline most of the day today</text>
  <text start="359.51" dur="5.64">and a good part of yesterday because of</text>
  <text start="361.94" dur="4.53">the heavy traffic so they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="365.15" dur="3.99">deal with the traffic and a lot of other</text>
  <text start="366.47" dur="5.64">issues in the additional traffic going</text>
  <text start="369.14" dur="5.1">to the website isn&amp;#39;t helping alright if</text>
  <text start="372.11" dur="4.26">you are like I said if you&amp;#39;re tech-savvy</text>
  <text start="374.24" dur="4.74">and you want further information you can</text>
  <text start="376.37" dur="5.55">get a go to code monkeys page is he&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="378.98" dur="4.98">code monkeys z on twitter go check him</text>
  <text start="381.92" dur="5.19">out all right people have been asking</text>
  <text start="383.96" dur="6.09">about Q&amp;#39;s Borg Patriots fight it has not</text>
  <text start="387.11" dur="4.98">been migrated to a cocoon yet because</text>
  <text start="390.05" dur="5.88">code monkey has not received from</text>
  <text start="392.09" dur="6.87">permission from Q he plans to do that</text>
  <text start="395.93" dur="7.26">publicly on the research board</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="6.03">and this is was his explanation here for</text>
  <text start="403.19" dur="3.9">everybody asking why Patriots fight</text>
  <text start="404.99" dur="4.17">wasn&amp;#39;t migrated it&amp;#39;s because the board</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="3.57">owner never emailed to ask for it to be</text>
  <text start="409.16" dur="3.18">migrated in this case I&amp;#39;ll make an</text>
  <text start="410.66" dur="3.84">exception and migrate it at the request</text>
  <text start="412.34" dur="4.32">of the board owner if you request it</text>
  <text start="414.5" dur="3.569">publicly on this board please be patient</text>
  <text start="416.66" dur="3.36">as we fix bugs and networking</text>
  <text start="418.069" dur="4.761">connectivity issues it might take us a</text>
  <text start="420.02" dur="7.53">couple days to be fully stable again</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="6.25">they&amp;#39;re also working on the issue that a</text>
  <text start="427.55" dur="5.489">lot of people who are posting are</text>
  <text start="429.08" dur="5.959">getting this same user IDs he&amp;#39;s working</text>
  <text start="433.039" dur="4.41">on that there&amp;#39;s a number of bugs and</text>
  <text start="435.039" dur="4.931">it&amp;#39;s just gonna take time to work out</text>
  <text start="437.449" dur="6.84">all the glitches but that problem does</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="7.5">not affect trip codes okay yesterday in</text>
  <text start="444.289" dur="6.241">a non posted a test message on a khun</text>
  <text start="447.47" dur="6.66">kaew research I think this may have</text>
  <text start="450.53" dur="8.52">actually been the first post by the user</text>
  <text start="454.13" dur="7.8">who is using cue strip code because this</text>
  <text start="459.05" dur="7.649">was at nineteen thirty five and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="461.93" dur="7.65">know what time zone that was in but it</text>
  <text start="466.699" dur="5.731">could have been my time zone I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="469.58" dur="5.07">sure about the time zones on eight kun</text>
  <text start="472.43" dur="5.34">yet and there&amp;#39;s also a couple of</text>
  <text start="474.65" dur="4.44">different locations I think it looks</text>
  <text start="477.77" dur="4.079">like there&amp;#39;s a German site and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.09" dur="5.669">also a UK site I&amp;#39;m not sure what the</text>
  <text start="481.849" dur="6.451">times time zones are all about so but</text>
  <text start="484.759" dur="7.34">this post came out forward slash bas</text>
  <text start="488.3" dur="7.04">underscore test slash one and then</text>
  <text start="492.099" dur="7.44">twelve minutes later there was this post</text>
  <text start="495.34" dur="7.87">forward slash bas underscore test / -</text>
  <text start="499.539" dur="6.551">this one had Q strip code this one did</text>
  <text start="503.21" dur="6.959">not however those posts are identical</text>
  <text start="506.09" dur="8.43">other than test1 and test2 so this may</text>
  <text start="510.169" dur="6.381">have been the same user posting before</text>
  <text start="514.52" dur="8.97">they logged in under the trip code</text>
  <text start="516.55" dur="12.13">alright just to give you a comparison</text>
  <text start="523.49" dur="8.76">here the last post that Q dropped on a</text>
  <text start="528.68" dur="6.719">chan on August 1st this was that post</text>
  <text start="532.25" dur="6.6">here&amp;#39;s the trip code - exclamation marks</text>
  <text start="535.399" dur="9.11">lowercase M uppercase g7v</text>
  <text start="538.85" dur="10.71">J lowercase Z Z n CI same trip code here</text>
  <text start="544.509" dur="10.781">identical this was the test to bas test</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="7.889">to post same trip code and if this user</text>
  <text start="555.29" dur="6.2">is using Q strip code and if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="557.449" dur="6.961">password secured I think that gives us</text>
  <text start="561.49" dur="7.48">reasonable belief that this is probably</text>
  <text start="564.41" dur="7.109">Q alright the next post it was another</text>
  <text start="568.97" dur="9.419">test a little more information on this</text>

  <text start="603.649" dur="6.3">somewhat similar to a previous post and</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="6.979">this one was from February 21st of 2018</text>
  <text start="609.949" dur="5.911">I noticed and you look at these testing</text>
