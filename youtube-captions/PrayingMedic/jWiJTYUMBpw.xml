  <text start="94.02" dur="5.94">determine a topic for us to talk about</text>
  <text start="96.45" dur="5.73">and that every time I was thinking</text>
  <text start="99.96" dur="4.53">through what we were going to discuss I</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="3.78">would get this picture of just the two</text>
  <text start="104.49" dur="3.57">of us having a conversation amongst</text>

  <text start="140.4" dur="7.74">be blessed by it and I just want you to</text>
  <text start="143.64" dur="6.26">listen in and enjoy praying medic he has</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="5.299">been a paramedic for over 30</text>
  <text start="149.9" dur="5.19">years he was a former atheist he is a</text>
  <text start="153.439" dur="4.89">former atheist he gave his life to the</text>
  <text start="155.09" dur="6.239">Lord in the year 2000 and he has a</text>
  <text start="158.329" dur="5.671">number of excellent books my craziest</text>
  <text start="161.329" dur="5.341">adventures with God divine healing made</text>
  <text start="164" dur="3.959">simple and his latest one is seeing and</text>
  <text start="166.67" dur="3.33">the spirit made simple which I just</text>

  <text start="170" dur="4.739">blessed by what shared in the</text>

  <text start="174.739" dur="4.86">me tell you something so I was reading</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="18.179">seeing of the spirit made simple right</text>
  <text start="179.599" dur="18.961">and I got stuck just in the first the</text>
  <text start="196.069" dur="5.31">first was I have actually pulling it up</text>
  <text start="198.56" dur="4.56">next I wanted to make sure I said it</text>
  <text start="201.379" dur="4.11">right you were basically talking about</text>
  <text start="203.12" dur="4.38">how it&amp;#39;s - yeah it&amp;#39;s tempting to think</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="4.021">that God is the one who sets the stage</text>
  <text start="207.5" dur="4.5">for our relationship but it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="209.51" dur="5.009">our personal view of him that dictates</text>
  <text start="212" dur="3.989">the experiences that we have and if we</text>
  <text start="214.519" dur="2.821">permit ourselves the liberty of seeing</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="3">him as a friend we&amp;#39;ll have the kind of</text>
  <text start="217.34" dur="3.75">experiences that friends have and if we</text>
  <text start="218.989" dur="3.511">see him as too busy to be bothered we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="4.739">never feel worthy of being in his</text>
  <text start="222.5" dur="5.43">presence and that was so good it was</text>
  <text start="225.829" dur="4.77">good you like it yeah I love it</text>
  <text start="227.93" dur="6.66">you know this whole idea cuz I know I</text>
  <text start="230.599" dur="7.651">think I spent so many years kind of in</text>
  <text start="234.59" dur="8.549">that place of just you know God is God</text>
  <text start="238.25" dur="18.959">and he you know he loves me he&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="243.139" dur="15.75">busy - that didn&amp;#39;t change for me</text>
  <text start="257.209" dur="9.27">I mean I grew up in the church you know</text>
  <text start="258.889" dur="9.331">I you know I gave my life to the Lord it</text>
  <text start="266.479" dur="3.72">was like I just know there&amp;#39;s more I know</text>
  <text start="268.22" dur="3.18">there&amp;#39;s more there&amp;#39;s more I want to know</text>
  <text start="270.199" dur="3.931">more and that&amp;#39;s when everything changed</text>
  <text start="271.4" dur="5.579">for me but I was in my thirties that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="5.88">you know and obviously for me being an</text>
  <text start="276.979" dur="5.851">atheist that was a radical place that I</text>
  <text start="280.01" dur="3.78">had had come to I see our relationship</text>
  <text start="282.83" dur="3.24">with God</text>
  <text start="283.79" dur="4.08">if you go through the Scriptures</text>
  <text start="286.07" dur="5.13">especially if you look at the parables</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="5.07">there&amp;#39;s so much richness in the parables</text>
  <text start="291.2" dur="4.92">that Jesus told and people tend to kind</text>
  <text start="292.94" dur="6.63">of overlook them but the parables speak</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="6.6">great depths of wisdom to those who are</text>
  <text start="299.57" dur="5.31">looking for greater revelation about the</text>
  <text start="302.72" dur="5.16">nature of God if you look to the</text>
  <text start="304.88" dur="5.79">parables you&amp;#39;ll see Jesus illustrating</text>
  <text start="307.88" dur="4.83">our relationships with the father in a</text>
  <text start="310.67" dur="3.8">number of different ways so there&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="312.71" dur="4.46">parable of the prodigal and the father</text>
  <text start="314.47" dur="7.09">so some people have that relationship</text>
  <text start="317.17" dur="7.51">for a season and then you see him</text>
  <text start="321.56" dur="6.56">talking about parables of servants who</text>
  <text start="324.68" dur="6.75">serve a master and then there are</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="5.02">parables about the bride so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="331.43" dur="4.68">their marriage relationship of the bride</text>
  <text start="333.14" dur="4.98">and the husband and there&amp;#39;s all these</text>
  <text start="336.11" dur="5.1">different parables that describe the</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="5.1">relationships we can have most people</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="4.62">start out with a relationship with God</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="5.28">that is something like the servant and</text>
  <text start="345.83" dur="5.31">they will couch it in the terms you know</text>
  <text start="348.5" dur="5.19">I&amp;#39;m just serving God and they literally</text>
  <text start="351.14" dur="7.8">see themselves as a person who&amp;#39;s hired</text>
  <text start="353.69" dur="8.34">on to work for God hopefully I think the</text>
  <text start="358.94" dur="5.72">goal of our of our experiences with God</text>
  <text start="362.03" dur="4.98">is to push us into a deeper relationship</text>
  <text start="364.66" dur="5.89">you know when Jesus told the disciples</text>
  <text start="367.01" dur="6.3">you&amp;#39;ve called me master but now I call</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="4.77">you friend because a servant does not</text>
  <text start="373.31" dur="4.14">know his master&amp;#39;s business but I have</text>
  <text start="375.32" dur="4.68">revealed to you all things and Jesus was</text>
  <text start="377.45" dur="5.28">always drawing people into a closer</text>
  <text start="380" dur="4.71">deeper more intimate relationship they</text>
  <text start="382.73" dur="4.5">saw him as a teacher they saw him as a</text>
  <text start="384.71" dur="4.47">master but he said look I&amp;#39;m opening the</text>
  <text start="387.23" dur="4.2">door I want you to be my friend I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="389.18" dur="4.35">going to reveal to you the mysteries of</text>
  <text start="391.43" dur="4.2">my father&amp;#39;s kingdom I&amp;#39;m going to reveal</text>
  <text start="393.53" dur="4.62">to you great things that you can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="395.63" dur="6.42">imagine for me it&amp;#39;s so exciting to see</text>
  <text start="398.15" dur="6.6">people stepping into that intimacy that</text>
  <text start="402.05" dur="4.98">friendship with God and seeing</text>
  <text start="404.75" dur="4.65">themselves as a more significant part of</text>
  <text start="407.03" dur="4.74">God&amp;#39;s plan and his kingdom it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="409.4" dur="3.72">great to experience it myself and then</text>
  <text start="411.77" dur="3.86">to share it with others and see people</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="2.51">walking in it</text>
  <text start="417.16" dur="5.67">like it was in 2012 in September 2012</text>
  <text start="421.24" dur="4.65">and I was at this conference I was at a</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="5.1">women&amp;#39;s conference and we were in</text>

  <text start="431.08" dur="4.11">evening of the conference and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.28" dur="5.85">one of the pastors there was talking</text>

  <text start="444.25" dur="6.87">she asked everyone to close her eyes and</text>
  <text start="446.19" dur="8.29">and she prayed over us and she asked she</text>
  <text start="451.12" dur="5.67">says if you&amp;#39;re hearing if you&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="454.48" dur="5.58">something from the Lord you know stand</text>
  <text start="456.79" dur="6.93">up and I am presumably people were</text>
  <text start="460.06" dur="5.85">standing up and she said if people if</text>
  <text start="463.72" dur="4.8">you have seen something you know from</text>
  <text start="465.91" dur="4.59">the Lord stand up so folks are standing</text>
  <text start="468.52" dur="3.9">up I didn&amp;#39;t see anything I didn&amp;#39;t hear</text>

  <text start="557.58" dur="4.24">first time I ever had a vision and it</text>
  <text start="560.11" dur="2.729">was the first of many after that but he</text>
  <text start="561.82" dur="4.2">had showed me a vision me on a</text>
  <text start="562.839" dur="5.041">playground as a kid playing that trust</text>

  <text start="572.02" dur="5.4">was showing me that I would go backwards</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="5.189">I go backwards but at the last minute I</text>
  <text start="577.42" dur="9.63">put my arm back and I braced myself for</text>
  <text start="580.209" dur="8.671">the fall out you know but he didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="587.05" dur="6.99">it wasn&amp;#39;t condemning it was just what</text>
  <text start="588.88" dur="9.45">you do to me and I was like do you know</text>
  <text start="594.04" dur="6.359">why you do that and I&amp;#39;m like no I do</text>

  <text start="600.399" dur="4.201">absolutely no idea how much I love you</text>
  <text start="602.5" dur="4.56">and that was like and that was it and</text>

  <text start="607.06" dur="5.88">was like wow you know that that was like</text>
  <text start="610.63" dur="5.07">such that was like my turning point in</text>

  <text start="631.93" dur="5.159">it would yeah I lived in a season of my</text>
  <text start="635.26" dur="4.59">life for about seven years where I</text>
  <text start="637.089" dur="6.06">gathered a lot of head knowledge about</text>
  <text start="639.85" dur="8.19">God you know we all know you know John</text>
  <text start="643.149" dur="7.951">3:16 this I know for the Bible tells me</text>
  <text start="648.04" dur="5.489">so and we gather all this knowledge in</text>
  <text start="651.1" dur="4.17">our mind about God but a lot of that</text>
  <text start="653.529" dur="4.201">knowledge it just kind of stays up in</text>
  <text start="655.27" dur="3.87">our in our brain and it never moves down</text>
  <text start="657.73" dur="3.81">into our heart and it never becomes</text>
  <text start="659.14" dur="5.31">something that we we live out and it</text>
  <text start="661.54" dur="4.859">never becomes the operating system for</text>
  <text start="664.45" dur="4.53">our life that it&amp;#39;s supposed to be and a</text>
  <text start="666.399" dur="5.761">lot of that has to do with trust I think</text>
  <text start="668.98" dur="6.69">it&amp;#39;s very difficult if you have been</text>
  <text start="672.16" dur="5.46">raised in a family culture where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="675.67" dur="4.14">basically told it&amp;#39;s all about what you</text>
  <text start="677.62" dur="5.4">make for yourself and you know making</text>
  <text start="679.81" dur="4.83">the best of your opportunities and doing</text>
  <text start="683.02" dur="1.81">well in school and it&amp;#39;s all about what</text>
  <text start="684.64" dur="2.379">you</text>
  <text start="684.83" dur="4.89">yeah if it&amp;#39;s gonna be it&amp;#39;s up to me I</text>
  <text start="687.019" dur="5.82">think a lot of people have that</text>
  <text start="689.72" dur="4.98">viewpoint so ingrained into the fiber of</text>
  <text start="692.839" dur="3.541">who they are that even when they become</text>
  <text start="694.7" dur="3.75">Christians and even when they go to</text>
  <text start="696.38" dur="4.05">Bible College and even when they you</text>
  <text start="698.45" dur="4.35">know study and go to prayer services and</text>
  <text start="700.43" dur="5.25">worship services they gather more</text>
  <text start="702.8" dur="5.49">information about God but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="705.68" dur="5.58">something that blocks it from getting</text>
  <text start="708.29" dur="5.729">down into their heart and becoming a</text>
  <text start="711.26" dur="7.05">reality that I didn&amp;#39;t live from and I</text>
  <text start="714.019" dur="6.901">see so many people who really doubt that</text>
  <text start="718.31" dur="4.56">God really truly cicely does love them</text>
  <text start="720.92" dur="4.32">and is for them they might even say you</text>
  <text start="722.87" dur="5.7">know God I know God loves me I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="725.24" dur="5.82">not sure he likes me you know or I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="728.57" dur="4.32">sure that he wants me to be healed or I</text>
  <text start="731.06" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t really think he wants me to have a</text>
  <text start="732.89" dur="3.93">good job they can express these</text>
  <text start="735.23" dur="3.69">theological ideas that you learn in the</text>
  <text start="736.82" dur="4.29">Bible within the everything they say</text>
  <text start="738.92" dur="5.7">after that shows that they&amp;#39;ve got some</text>
  <text start="741.11" dur="6.57">trust issues some wrong ideas about his</text>
  <text start="744.62" dur="6.209">character or his plan one of my goals is</text>
  <text start="747.68" dur="5.88">to share some of the observations that</text>
  <text start="750.829" dur="6.121">I&amp;#39;ve seen and I&amp;#39;ve lived out in my own</text>
  <text start="753.56" dur="6.96">life where he has really pushed me to</text>
  <text start="756.95" dur="6.99">trust him in greater ways and to receive</text>
  <text start="760.52" dur="14.009">his love in bigger ways and things like</text>
  <text start="763.94" dur="16.56">like you talked about my wife&amp;#39;s dream</text>
  <text start="774.529" dur="13.201">yes I was near tears when I read that</text>
  <text start="780.5" dur="13.709">and for the benefit you can read it if</text>
  <text start="787.73" dur="7.979">you want okay can I read that I think it</text>
  <text start="794.209" dur="7.921">would probably make a lot of people cry</text>
  <text start="795.709" dur="6.721">it made me cry when I think okay here we</text>
  <text start="802.13" dur="2.19">go</text>
  <text start="802.43" dur="3.99">my wife had been struggling with the</text>
  <text start="804.32" dur="4.199">burden of deciding what steps to take in</text>
  <text start="806.42" dur="4.349">her career she is trained as a painter</text>
  <text start="808.519" dur="4.231">and her heart&amp;#39;s desire is to paint the</text>
  <text start="810.769" dur="4.201">pictures that flow from her imagination</text>
  <text start="812.75" dur="3.87">but the stereotype she learned in art</text>
  <text start="814.97" dur="3.09">school about starving artists always</text>
  <text start="816.62" dur="2.01">prevented her from believing she could</text>
  <text start="818.06" dur="3.06">make a live</text>
  <text start="818.63" dur="3.93">as a painter so for the last 15 years</text>
  <text start="821.12" dur="3.69">she&amp;#39;s worked as a graphic designer</text>
  <text start="822.56" dur="4.02">because it pays the bills the work</text>
  <text start="824.81" dur="3.57">doesn&amp;#39;t inspire her and it often leaves</text>
  <text start="826.58" dur="3.51">her with neck pain and a headache at the</text>
  <text start="828.38" dur="3.33">end of the day but she&amp;#39;s been afraid of</text>
  <text start="830.09" dur="3.87">making the changes that would allow her</text>
  <text start="831.71" dur="3.84">to become a full-time painter the real</text>
  <text start="833.96" dur="4.29">struggle is that she wasn&amp;#39;t certain that</text>
  <text start="835.55" dur="4.98">God wanted her she wasn&amp;#39;t certain what</text>
  <text start="838.25" dur="4.08">God wanted her to do she felt that she</text>
  <text start="840.53" dur="4.14">made the wrong choice she might</text>
  <text start="842.33" dur="3.78">disappoint God never sell any paintings</text>
  <text start="844.67" dur="3.81">and leave us in a difficult place</text>
  <text start="846.11" dur="4.47">financially one night she had a dream</text>
  <text start="848.48" dur="3.99">where Jesus paid her a visit in the</text>
  <text start="850.58" dur="3.72">dream he came to her rather excitedly</text>
  <text start="852.47" dur="3.3">and handed her a piece of paper the</text>
  <text start="854.3" dur="3.42">paper was blank except for the</text>
  <text start="855.77" dur="4.5">letterhead at the top that appeared in a</text>
  <text start="857.72" dur="6.63">beautiful pink font which read super</text>
  <text start="860.27" dur="5.67">praying medics wife after handing her</text>
  <text start="864.35" dur="4.62">the blank piece of paper he looks</text>
  <text start="865.94" dur="6.15">excitedly into her eyes and asked what</text>
  <text start="868.97" dur="4.83">are you going to be this dream</text>
  <text start="872.09" dur="3.42">profoundly changed the way in which my</text>
  <text start="873.8" dur="3.66">wife saw her relationship with Jesus</text>
  <text start="875.51" dur="4.2">rather than thinking she had to somehow</text>
  <text start="877.46" dur="4.47">know what he wanted her to do and suffer</text>
  <text start="879.71" dur="4.14">the consequences if she was wrong she</text>
  <text start="881.93" dur="3.72">realized that he was actually her</text>
  <text start="883.85" dur="3.69">biggest fan and regardless of which</text>
  <text start="885.65" dur="4.41">choice she made he supported her</text>
  <text start="887.54" dur="6.12">decision and was excited to see how it</text>
  <text start="890.06" dur="16.35">would turn out now that is not theology</text>
  <text start="893.66" dur="15.78">they teach you in church that story is</text>
  <text start="906.41" dur="8.6">so rich and you know it had me thinking</text>
  <text start="909.44" dur="10.88">about a couple of things one is in Psalm</text>
  <text start="915.01" dur="7.57">37 37 5 and I was looking at it and the</text>
  <text start="920.32" dur="3.7">amplified actually right before I hopped</text>
  <text start="922.58" dur="3.3">on with you excited just the kind of</text>
  <text start="924.02" dur="3.15">whenever I find something that like</text>
  <text start="925.88" dur="5.25">speaks I want to read it in every</text>
  <text start="927.17" dur="7.29">translation you know and and 37 no 37</text>
  <text start="931.13" dur="4.92">for you no delight yourself also in the</text>
  <text start="934.46" dur="4.86">Lord and He will give you the desires</text>
  <text start="936.05" dur="5.91">and secret petitions of your heart right</text>
  <text start="939.32" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s more context around that but</text>
  <text start="941.96" dur="7.62">it&amp;#39;s so funny this whole thing about</text>
  <text start="946.22" dur="4.95">delighting ourselves in him him giving</text>
  <text start="949.58" dur="3.78">us the desires and this</text>
  <text start="951.17" dur="4.979">secret petitions like that was just so</text>
  <text start="953.36" dur="5.279">good and the secret petitions of our</text>
  <text start="956.149" dur="4.62">heart and that&amp;#39;s what that dream that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="958.639" dur="4.921">the the dream with your wife reminded me</text>
  <text start="960.769" dur="5.581">so much of that that scripture and just</text>
  <text start="963.56" dur="6.089">two weeks ago just two weeks ago I got a</text>
  <text start="966.35" dur="4.679">phone call from a friend the Lord had</text>

  <text start="1037.36" dur="5.699">that I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with so I started</text>
  <text start="1040.12" dur="5.459">a new job back in February and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1043.059" dur="4.89">new company new startup there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1045.579" dur="3.72">opportunities for growth and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1047.949" dur="3.6">opportunities for promotion in this</text>
  <text start="1049.299" dur="4.291">company we started out with a very small</text>
  <text start="1051.549" dur="4.561">group of people but the first people on</text>
  <text start="1053.59" dur="4.469">the door it was made very clear that</text>
  <text start="1056.11" dur="4.26">they would have opportunities to do</text>
  <text start="1058.059" dur="3.721">training and to do supervision and you</text>
  <text start="1060.37" dur="4.439">know marketing and whatever they wanted</text>
  <text start="1061.78" dur="4.5">to do so at that time the Lord was</text>
  <text start="1064.809" dur="4.561">giving me a lot of different dreams</text>
  <text start="1066.28" dur="5.43">about things like marketing and training</text>
  <text start="1069.37" dur="4.32">and supervision and night after night</text>
  <text start="1071.71" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m having these dreams and then we were</text>
  <text start="1073.69" dur="4.38">getting ready to publish the book</text>
  <text start="1074.95" dur="5.82">singing in the spirit and I was feeling</text>
  <text start="1078.07" dur="4.65">a lot of juice on reading more books and</text>
  <text start="1080.77" dur="4.2">publishing because that&amp;#39;s really my</text>
  <text start="1082.72" dur="3.72">passion I was getting</text>
  <text start="1084.97" dur="3.93">excited to work for this new company</text>
  <text start="1086.44" dur="4.05">because the company I had been working</text>
  <text start="1088.9" dur="3.57">for the for the previous three and a</text>
  <text start="1090.49" dur="3.059">half years was a very very difficult</text>
  <text start="1092.47" dur="3.27">place to work at</text>
  <text start="1093.549" dur="4.351">and I&amp;#39;m not going to go into the details</text>
  <text start="1095.74" dur="4.14">it was just hard to work there and so I</text>
  <text start="1097.9" dur="4.009">was rejoicing when God gave me a new</text>
  <text start="1099.88" dur="3.99">opportunity to work for a new employer</text>
  <text start="1101.909" dur="4.601">it was it&amp;#39;s just been a great</text>
  <text start="1103.87" dur="5.039">opportunity but the thing is right in</text>
  <text start="1106.51" dur="5.01">this time of my life I&amp;#39;m having so many</text>
  <text start="1108.909" dur="5.281">opportunities and I can&amp;#39;t choose all of</text>
  <text start="1111.52" dur="6.18">them and I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about</text>
  <text start="1114.19" dur="7.38">actually retiring for medicine and just</text>
  <text start="1117.7" dur="6.209">writing books but it&amp;#39;s a big step</text>
  <text start="1121.57" dur="4.979">because walking away from my steady</text>
  <text start="1123.909" dur="5.161">paycheck and my career you take a chance</text>
  <text start="1126.549" dur="5.88">on writing books is a big step it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1129.07" dur="5.01">big leap of faith so you know the Lord</text>
  <text start="1132.429" dur="4.201">is giving me all these dreams that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1134.08" dur="9.329">like oh just stop already I have so many</text>
  <text start="1136.63" dur="9.63">choices so this friend of mine Andrea</text>
  <text start="1143.409" dur="5.911">Walker she lives in the UK she sends me</text>
  <text start="1146.26" dur="5.34">a private message and she says hey PM I</text>
  <text start="1149.32" dur="5.489">had a dream about you and I wanted to</text>
  <text start="1151.6" dur="4.98">share with you so she explains the dream</text>
  <text start="1154.809" dur="5.071">she says I could see you standing in</text>
  <text start="1156.58" dur="4.95">this hallway and there were doors on the</text>
  <text start="1159.88" dur="2.97">left-hand side of the hallway and there</text>
  <text start="1161.53" dur="3.45">were doors on the right-hand side and</text>
  <text start="1162.85" dur="5.16">there are all these different doors and</text>
  <text start="1164.98" dur="6.3">I had a very strong sense that you were</text>
  <text start="1168.01" dur="5.46">waiting for God to show you which door</text>
  <text start="1171.28" dur="5.009">you were supposed to walk through and</text>
  <text start="1173.47" dur="4.53">the Lord was sitting there waiting and</text>
  <text start="1176.289" dur="4.291">he said I&amp;#39;m not gonna tell you which one</text>
  <text start="1178" dur="3.84">to open it&amp;#39;s your choice and I was and</text>
  <text start="1180.58" dur="2.88">she said in the dream you were getting</text>
  <text start="1181.84" dur="3.99">angry because he wasn&amp;#39;t going to show</text>
  <text start="1183.46" dur="5.01">you which door and you know you were</text>
  <text start="1185.83" dur="4.2">having with discussion and he said no</text>
  <text start="1188.47" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m not gonna show you a choice</text>
  <text start="1190.03" dur="7.8">and I&amp;#39;m like but Lord you need to choose</text>
  <text start="1191.71" dur="9.57">for me I want to do your will and so she</text>
  <text start="1197.83" dur="6.9">said finally this light came on behind</text>
  <text start="1201.28" dur="5.54">me and the light cast a shadow and the</text>
  <text start="1204.73" dur="4.26">shadow pointed to one of the doors and</text>
  <text start="1206.82" dur="5.17">she said I walked over to the door and</text>
  <text start="1208.99" dur="4.919">opened it and the Lord said you knew</text>
  <text start="1211.99" dur="5.909">which was the right door all along you</text>
  <text start="1213.909" dur="4.9">just didn&amp;#39;t want to miss it so like you</text>
  <text start="1217.899" dur="3.451">I&amp;#39;ve been thinking</text>
  <text start="1218.809" dur="6.57">of that dream for a long time ever since</text>
  <text start="1221.35" dur="7.209">she gave it to because what the Lord</text>
  <text start="1225.379" dur="6.12">told me about this whole situation is he</text>
  <text start="1228.559" dur="6.511">said once you have walked with me long</text>
  <text start="1231.499" dur="6.18">enough and you know my heart yes and you</text>
  <text start="1235.07" dur="3.78">know my plants and you understand what</text>
  <text start="1237.679" dur="2.911">your destiny is and you kind of</text>
  <text start="1238.85" dur="4.799">understand your gifting and your calling</text>
  <text start="1240.59" dur="4.38">and your you are connected to the people</text>
  <text start="1243.649" dur="3.091">that you&amp;#39;re supposed to be in</text>
  <text start="1244.97" dur="3.179">relationship with and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1246.74" dur="3.149">alignment with your assignment and</text>
  <text start="1248.149" dur="4.441">you&amp;#39;re doing those things what he said</text>
  <text start="1249.889" dur="4.081">is you get to this point where when</text>
  <text start="1252.59" dur="3.179">you&amp;#39;re a new believer there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1253.97" dur="4.47">doors you could go through that are not</text>
  <text start="1255.769" dur="5.701">good for you there&amp;#39;s opportunities that</text>
  <text start="1258.44" dur="5.67">are probably not advantageous to you the</text>
  <text start="1261.47" dur="5.189">longer you walk with God the more you</text>

  <text start="1269.6" dur="4.47">surrounded with opportunities none of</text>
  <text start="1271.82" dur="4.5">which are bad opportunities they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1274.07" dur="4.41">good opportunities it&amp;#39;s just an issue of</text>
  <text start="1276.32" dur="16.199">you choosing what you want to do and</text>
  <text start="1278.48" dur="15.75">that is powerful as we&amp;#39;re growing in</text>
  <text start="1292.519" dur="4.23">relationship with him like I said I felt</text>
  <text start="1294.23" dur="5.309">like a big I felt like a baby in Christ</text>
  <text start="1296.749" dur="5.221">I mean I had a lot of head knowledge a</text>
  <text start="1299.539" dur="4.02">lot I go to a word church I miss a</text>
  <text start="1301.97" dur="4.319">spirit-filled Church and it&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="1303.559" dur="4.32">word churches all of that but I just my</text>
  <text start="1306.289" dur="5.161">experience was just kind of just</text>
  <text start="1307.879" dur="5.76">observing and just soaking it all in you</text>
  <text start="1311.45" dur="5.339">know and so and so that shift happened</text>
  <text start="1313.639" dur="6.211">for me it&amp;#39;s like even though that was</text>
  <text start="1316.789" dur="5.071">only a few years ago the fact that there</text>
  <text start="1319.85" dur="4.23">was a lot of solid foundation and just a</text>
  <text start="1321.86" dur="5.25">few lights that were just turned on is</text>
  <text start="1324.08" dur="5.76">in my heart have just completely like</text>
  <text start="1327.11" dur="4.909">the last three years it&amp;#39;s like you</text>
  <text start="1329.84" dur="5.309">restore a time like he excited just</text>
  <text start="1332.019" dur="7.961">accelerated things you know yes there is</text>
  <text start="1335.149" dur="7.591">a great acceleration it&amp;#39;s crazy yeah</text>
  <text start="1339.98" dur="4.199">people are learning more in a year than</text>
  <text start="1342.74" dur="7.2">they&amp;#39;ve learned in the previous ten</text>
  <text start="1344.179" dur="8.931">years yes think about you were an</text>
  <text start="1349.94" dur="3.17">atheist I</text>
  <text start="1359.03" dur="11.89">well yeah that was in 2000 the thing is</text>
  <text start="1367.44" dur="6.72">you can read books and you can gain head</text>
  <text start="1370.92" dur="6.9">knowledge but you limit yourself to a</text>
  <text start="1374.16" dur="6.75">pace of learning that is rather slow but</text>
  <text start="1377.82" dur="5.76">when you step into the kingdom and you</text>
  <text start="1380.91" dur="4.74">step into the spiritual realm you know</text>
  <text start="1383.58" dur="4.26">here&amp;#39;s something that that people can</text>
  <text start="1385.65" dur="4.59">maybe think about when you step into the</text>
  <text start="1387.84" dur="5.34">spiritual world and you have like a</text>
  <text start="1390.24" dur="6.57">vision or you have a dream you can</text>
  <text start="1393.18" dur="5.52">receive the revelation and experiences</text>
  <text start="1396.81" dur="4.68">of a thousand years of history in an</text>
  <text start="1398.7" dur="4.14">instant and the spiritual world I think</text>
  <text start="1401.49" dur="4.91">the acceleration that people are</text>
  <text start="1402.84" dur="6">experiencing is they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="1406.4" dur="4.81">apprehending the truths of the kingdom</text>
  <text start="1408.84" dur="28.34">instead of the knowledge of religion</text>
  <text start="1411.21" dur="28.11">yeah absolutely God and part of that</text>
  <text start="1437.18" dur="4.3">experience has got to be getting away</text>
  <text start="1439.32" dur="3.66">from a certain kind of minds that we</text>
  <text start="1441.48" dur="4.08">have about this whole thing around gifts</text>
  <text start="1442.98" dur="4.14">and abilities so yeah and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1445.56" dur="3.78">running into this more and more over the</text>
  <text start="1447.12" dur="4.53">last week oddly enough I&amp;#39;ve been having</text>
  <text start="1449.34" dur="5.28">people sending me messages saying you</text>
  <text start="1451.65" dur="5.85">know I had this really nice guy and he</text>
  <text start="1454.62" dur="5.01">sent me a message and he said hey but</text>
  <text start="1457.5" dur="2.49">it&amp;#39;d be possible for you to lay hands on</text>
  <text start="1459.63" dur="3.21">me</text>
  <text start="1459.99" dur="5.24">so that could receive an impartation or</text>
  <text start="1462.84" dur="6.71">you know a gift of healing from you and</text>
  <text start="1465.23" dur="4.32">I was like oh here we go</text>
  <text start="1471.5" dur="6.28">so he read my book I&amp;#39;m healing and I was</text>
  <text start="1475.23" dur="5.16">thinking to myself okay so you read the</text>
  <text start="1477.78" dur="4.56">book what part of you have the Holy</text>
  <text start="1480.39" dur="3.84">Spirit in you you don&amp;#39;t need anything</text>
  <text start="1482.34" dur="4.079">else what part of that don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="1484.23" dur="4.86">understand he was</text>
  <text start="1486.419" dur="4.5">he was just very sincere and I actually</text>
  <text start="1489.09" dur="4.26">sent him a voice message I&amp;#39;m on a social</text>
  <text start="1490.919" dur="4.74">network me we that allows you to send</text>
  <text start="1493.35" dur="4.949">record voice messages and send him back</text>
  <text start="1495.659" dur="5.551">and forth okay I was talking to this guy</text>
  <text start="1498.299" dur="5.271">and I said look you really don&amp;#39;t need an</text>
  <text start="1501.21" dur="6.299">impartation from anybody you don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="1503.57" dur="6.64">to receive the gift of healing you have</text>
  <text start="1507.509" dur="4.26">the Holy Spirit in you Jesus has given</text>
  <text start="1510.21" dur="3.87">you all the authority you&amp;#39;re ever gonna</text>
  <text start="1511.769" dur="4.47">need to heal the Holy Spirit is the</text>
  <text start="1514.08" dur="3.689">power within you that gives you all the</text>
  <text start="1516.239" dur="3.39">power you&amp;#39;re gonna need to heal anything</text>
  <text start="1517.769" dur="4.29">from Lou Gehrig&amp;#39;s disease to a migraine</text>
  <text start="1519.629" dur="4.68">headache there isn&amp;#39;t anything that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1522.059" dur="6.421">going to give you that you don&amp;#39;t already</text>
  <text start="1524.309" dur="7.381">have now I do believe because the Bible</text>
  <text start="1528.48" dur="4.74">says Paul said I pray that I&amp;#39;ll be able</text>
  <text start="1531.69" dur="3.15">to come to you and impart some spiritual</text>
  <text start="1533.22" dur="3.51">gifts by the laying on of hands I do</text>
  <text start="1534.84" dur="3.209">believe in impartation to the laying on</text>
  <text start="1536.73" dur="4.23">of hands that you can impart spiritual</text>
  <text start="1538.049" dur="7.2">gifts so I&amp;#39;m not questioning that but</text>
  <text start="1540.96" dur="8.25">the issue of healing healing operates in</text>
  <text start="1545.249" dur="7.951">two ways there is the power of the Holy</text>
  <text start="1549.21" dur="6.649">Spirit resident in us and the authority</text>
  <text start="1553.2" dur="5.609">that Jesus has given us that is</text>
  <text start="1555.859" dur="6.461">effectual for the work of healing that</text>
  <text start="1558.809" dur="5.43">requires nothing else the power of the</text>
  <text start="1562.32" dur="4.979">Holy Spirit and the authority Jesus gave</text>
  <text start="1564.239" dur="6.12">the disciples is for the general work of</text>
  <text start="1567.299" dur="4.891">healing and deliverance and that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1570.359" dur="2.19">function like a gift it&amp;#39;s just you have</text>
  <text start="1572.19" dur="3.299">it</text>
  <text start="1572.549" dur="5.37">let your faith grow go lay hands on</text>
  <text start="1575.489" dur="5.9">people in the charismatic church we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1577.919" dur="6.33">kind of created some sacred cows that</text>
  <text start="1581.389" dur="5.29">don&amp;#39;t really serve our purposes all that</text>
  <text start="1584.249" dur="4.02">well and a lot of people are running</text>
  <text start="1586.679" dur="3.271">around well I need someone to lay hands</text>
  <text start="1588.269" dur="3.63">on me oh yeah I need an impartation</text>
  <text start="1589.95" dur="4.74">I need a you know whatever from some</text>
  <text start="1591.899" dur="5.49">anointed leader and I really think that</text>
  <text start="1594.69" dur="5.719">there&amp;#39;s less truth to that than we</text>
  <text start="1597.389" dur="5.581">believe and I think we would do well to</text>
  <text start="1600.409" dur="6.46">have an understanding that God has given</text>
  <text start="1602.97" dur="5.549">us most of what we need to go and do the</text>
  <text start="1606.869" dur="3.78">works of ministry without getting</text>
  <text start="1608.519" dur="4.59">impartation without running after people</text>
  <text start="1610.649" dur="4.561">and please pray over me and give me this</text>
  <text start="1613.109" dur="3.45">gift well you know I can&amp;#39;t I can pray</text>
  <text start="1615.21" dur="3.51">over people I can lay hands on them but</text>
  <text start="1616.559" dur="3.811">I have no control over what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1618.72" dur="3.51">gonna receive for me</text>
  <text start="1620.37" dur="3.33">I don&amp;#39;t have the ability to say I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1622.23" dur="2.43">gonna give you the gift of the word of</text>
  <text start="1623.7" dur="3.45">knowledge or something like that I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1624.66" dur="4.59">I don&amp;#39;t believe that I can do that and</text>
  <text start="1627.15" dur="5.22">I&amp;#39;ll tell you what I think is behind all</text>
  <text start="1629.25" dur="5.46">of this when I went to Australia to</text>
  <text start="1632.37" dur="4.95">teach on healing and deliverance we went</text>
  <text start="1634.71" dur="4.53">to this meeting and I gave a short</text>
  <text start="1637.32" dur="3.33">message and we were praying over people</text>
  <text start="1639.24" dur="4.02">and people were getting healed and stuff</text>
  <text start="1640.65" dur="7.2">and this young man comes to me and he</text>
  <text start="1643.26" dur="8.49">says hey hey mate can you that was in</text>
  <text start="1647.85" dur="6.66">Australia so I can so he asked me if I</text>
  <text start="1651.75" dur="5.82">could lay hands on him to impart a gift</text>
  <text start="1654.51" dur="6.93">of healing on him and I was talking to</text>
  <text start="1657.57" dur="6.229">my buddy Peter Coco he looks at me and</text>
  <text start="1661.44" dur="6.51">he goes you want to tell him or should I</text>
  <text start="1663.799" dur="7.451">and I said you can tell him you guys ok</text>
  <text start="1667.95" dur="6.12">so he says look they said you already</text>
  <text start="1671.25" dur="6.6">have all that you need you have the Holy</text>
  <text start="1674.07" dur="5.88">Spirit you have the authority what</text>
  <text start="1677.85" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;re really asking this guy to do is</text>
  <text start="1679.95" dur="5.64">to give you a shortcut that will</text>
  <text start="1682.26" dur="5.22">accelerate the process of you being able</text>
  <text start="1685.59" dur="6.03">to heal people he said there are no</text>
  <text start="1687.48" dur="7.25">shortcuts you are going to have to</text>
  <text start="1691.62" dur="6.48">develop your own history with God and</text>
  <text start="1694.73" dur="6.22">you cannot impart to you his history</text>
  <text start="1698.1" dur="5.91">with God see that&amp;#39;s the thing is I have</text>
  <text start="1700.95" dur="5.82">gone through the process of praying over</text>
  <text start="1704.01" dur="4.529">hundreds of people thousands now and</text>
  <text start="1706.77" dur="4.83">some good healed and some don&amp;#39;t but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1708.539" dur="5.311">in the process and learning the ways of</text>
  <text start="1711.6" dur="4.86">God I&amp;#39;m learning to hear his voice I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1713.85" dur="4.59">learning to see the things he wants to</text>
  <text start="1716.46" dur="5.43">show me and trying to cooperate with him</text>
  <text start="1718.44" dur="4.77">in doing I have to learn obedience and I</text>
  <text start="1721.89" dur="3.21">have to learn to cooperate with all the</text>
  <text start="1723.21" dur="4.89">spirit and I have to learn how to follow</text>
  <text start="1725.1" dur="6.569">him and everyone has to do it on their</text>
  <text start="1728.1" dur="4.949">own there is no shortcut there is no hey</text>
  <text start="1731.669" dur="3.481">just lay hands on me and then I&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="1733.049" dur="4.441">you 90% of the people healed it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1735.15" dur="4.8">work that way it does not work that way</text>
  <text start="1737.49" dur="4.83">you are gonna have to start at square</text>
  <text start="1739.95" dur="4.17">one like everyone else you&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="1742.32" dur="3.06">to go out there and lay hands on some</text>
  <text start="1744.12" dur="3.299">people who are not going to get healed</text>
  <text start="1745.38" dur="5.88">and you&amp;#39;re gonna have to come back and</text>
  <text start="1747.419" dur="6.24">go okay Jesus obviously the more things</text>
