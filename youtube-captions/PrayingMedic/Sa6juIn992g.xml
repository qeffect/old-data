  <text start="0.709" dur="4.961">alright so when it comes to sharpening a</text>
  <text start="3.449" dur="3.66">prophetic word there&amp;#39;s actually a call I</text>
  <text start="5.67" dur="3.27">don&amp;#39;t know if you guys have ever since</text>
  <text start="7.109" dur="4.381">this but there&amp;#39;s a call that the grace</text>
  <text start="8.94" dur="5.04">of God invites us into there&amp;#39;s a season</text>
  <text start="11.49" dur="5.369">where we we discover that speaking to us</text>
  <text start="13.98" dur="6.09">and then after we discover that season</text>
  <text start="16.859" dur="5.821">we start realizing that God calls us to</text>
  <text start="20.07" dur="5.82">what I would term the knowledge of the</text>
  <text start="22.68" dur="5.189">Lord and what I mean by that is now that</text>
  <text start="25.89" dur="5.16">God starts getting us familiar with his</text>
  <text start="27.869" dur="7.171">voice he calls us into a place to learn</text>
  <text start="31.05" dur="6.029">to become accurate and giving words for</text>
  <text start="35.04" dur="3.089">a purpose what so now what&amp;#39;s the reason</text>
  <text start="37.079" dur="2.91">you know when I first started</text>
  <text start="38.129" dur="4.86">prophesying to people or praying for</text>
  <text start="39.989" dur="5.671">people I would pray things like well you</text>
  <text start="42.989" dur="5.101">know I see a light over you and it looks</text>
  <text start="45.66" dur="5.82">like jello and it&amp;#39;s just kind of falling</text>
  <text start="48.09" dur="6.149">on you and you feel happy musings in</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="4.29">your soul and that doesn&amp;#39;t sound too</text>
  <text start="54.239" dur="3.031">great does it and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="55.77" dur="2.969">thought well thank God at least it&amp;#39;s God</text>
  <text start="57.27" dur="3.12">is saying something but for a lot of</text>
  <text start="58.739" dur="2.851">people you can&amp;#39;t really tie that to</text>
  <text start="60.39" dur="3.9">Scripture can you have you ever seen</text>
  <text start="61.59" dur="4.44">like jello and scripture and and you</text>
  <text start="64.29" dur="4.2">have an oozing inside your soul so that</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="3.81">doesn&amp;#39;t work right but we have to start</text>
  <text start="68.49" dur="3.96">somewhere around there hopefully you</text>
  <text start="69.84" dur="4.76">guys didn&amp;#39;t do it like I did but then I</text>
  <text start="72.45" dur="5.279">started realizing that God calls us to</text>
  <text start="74.6" dur="6.49">the knowledge of the Lord where we learn</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="4.651">to become accurate and precise so that</text>
  <text start="81.09" dur="3.599">it will edify the person we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="82.38" dur="4.529">ministering to remember the goal of</text>
  <text start="84.689" dur="5.311">Revelation is not only personal for us</text>
  <text start="86.909" dur="4.92">but it&amp;#39;s also to strengthen and empower</text>
  <text start="90" dur="4.32">other people so they can get on with</text>
  <text start="91.829" dur="4.261">their destiny in God and so we have to</text>
  <text start="94.32" dur="4.049">realize that God wants us to become</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="5.19">accurate and how we minister to people</text>
  <text start="98.369" dur="4.351">okay now this thing again a lot of</text>
  <text start="101.28" dur="3.69">people think well this is something that</text>
  <text start="102.72" dur="3.929">only if you can do and I&amp;#39;m here to just</text>
  <text start="104.97" dur="3.81">kind of work with you on this this</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="3.9">morning that&amp;#39;s a lie if you believe that</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="3.9">the enemy is convinced you of something</text>
  <text start="110.549" dur="5.07">that is not for you you can grow in</text>
  <text start="112.68" dur="4.079">accuracy and hopefully as we get through</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="3.96">this i&amp;#39;m going to show you just how</text>
  <text start="116.759" dur="4.831">normal disciples grew an accuracy before</text>
  <text start="119.579" dur="4.981">the lord is based on what he&amp;#39;s wanting</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="5.52">to accomplish not some special ability</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="3.929">that we have to have okay and so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.11" dur="3.75">look at how the Lord does this first</text>
  <text start="128.489" dur="5.111">thing we want to talk about is learning</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="7.29">to develop the steps of interpretation</text>
  <text start="133.6" dur="6.66">okay turn with me to Psalms 4610</text>
  <text start="138.15" dur="4.99">learning to learning the steps of</text>
  <text start="140.26" dur="5.07">interpretation now why is this so</text>
  <text start="143.14" dur="4.74">important because as we start walking</text>
  <text start="145.33" dur="5.22">with God we start realizing that God is</text>
  <text start="147.88" dur="4.08">speaking to us in fact when I go around</text>
  <text start="150.55" dur="2.85">the country and I talk with students</text>
  <text start="151.96" dur="2.94">about this I really try to point out to</text>
  <text start="153.4" dur="3.39">him look you don&amp;#39;t have to do anything</text>
  <text start="154.9" dur="3.69">to get God to speak teen speak to you</text>
  <text start="156.79" dur="3.84">scripture clearly tells you that God is</text>
  <text start="158.59" dur="4.68">speaking to you all the time the problem</text>
  <text start="160.63" dur="4.5">is not God the problem is we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="163.27" dur="3.93">paying attention we&amp;#39;re not aware of it</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="4.71">and we&amp;#39;ve not been trained to recognize</text>
  <text start="167.2" dur="4.59">his voice so the problem isn&amp;#39;t that God</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="6.23">isn&amp;#39;t speaking in fact we find in Romans</text>
  <text start="171.79" dur="7.53">1 that God is even right in the face of</text>
  <text start="176.07" dur="5.5">unbelievers and they&amp;#39;re suppressing the</text>
  <text start="179.32" dur="3.99">truth and unrighteousness okay so when</text>
  <text start="181.57" dur="4.29">people say I&amp;#39;ve never heard the voice of</text>
  <text start="183.31" dur="3.81">the Lord they&amp;#39;re just playing at the</text>
  <text start="185.86" dur="3.21">black would call it they&amp;#39;re playing a</text>
  <text start="187.12" dur="4.26">game with themselves their self</text>
  <text start="189.07" dur="4.59">deceiving themselves on purpose they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="191.38" dur="4.59">deceiving that God is relating to them</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="5.37">okay so there isn&amp;#39;t a problem that God</text>
  <text start="195.97" dur="5.4">is speaking the problem is recognizing</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="4.08">it learning how to walk with God and</text>
  <text start="201.37" dur="3.03">doing what he&amp;#39;s called us to do and so</text>
  <text start="203.11" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re going to talk about the steps of</text>
  <text start="204.4" dur="4.8">this in Psalms 4610 again everything</text>
  <text start="207.76" dur="3.75">that we do we have to realize that we</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="4.41">have to lay a biblical foundation and</text>
  <text start="211.51" dur="5.49">start building from that so in Psalms</text>
  <text start="213.61" dur="6.51">4610 it says this be still and know that</text>
  <text start="217" dur="6.48">I am God I will be exalted among the</text>
  <text start="220.12" dur="6.03">nations I will be exalted in the earth</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="5.49">now if you&amp;#39;ve had any basic training on</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="4.23">prophetic or devotional prayer or</text>
  <text start="228.97" dur="4.8">hearing the voice of the Lord this is a</text>
  <text start="230.38" dur="5.07">scripture is quoted quite often but the</text>
  <text start="233.77" dur="3.81">reason why it&amp;#39;s quoted is because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.45" dur="4.65">what we would call an eternal principle</text>
  <text start="237.58" dur="4.32">that we have to gain knowledge on this</text>
  <text start="240.1" dur="4.29">scripture is given for every generation</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="5.64">to understand the presence of the Lord</text>
  <text start="244.39" dur="4.89">in to hear his voice okay so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="247.54" dur="5.07">look at it just remote be still and know</text>
  <text start="249.28" dur="5.25">the word no here is very interesting so</text>
  <text start="252.61" dur="5.28">let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s talk about knowledge just</text>
  <text start="254.53" dur="5.1">for a minute okay the scripture uses</text>
  <text start="257.89" dur="4.2">three types of knowledge you need to be</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="4.14">aware of them if you&amp;#39;re not catching the</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="3.42">inference and the type of knowledge</text>
  <text start="263.77" dur="2.97">that&amp;#39;s talked about in the scripture you</text>
  <text start="265.51" dur="1.89">will miss what God is trying to</text>
  <text start="266.74" dur="2.64">communicate</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="3.81">to you so let me kind of just lay this</text>
  <text start="269.38" dur="2.94">out to you we have what we would call</text>
  <text start="271.21" dur="3.89">again I just talked about this a little</text>
  <text start="272.32" dur="4.92">bit last night what we would call</text>
  <text start="275.1" dur="4.539">propositional knowledge where God makes</text>
  <text start="277.24" dur="3.959">truth statements based out of revelation</text>
  <text start="279.639" dur="3.271">he wants you to understand it because</text>
  <text start="281.199" dur="4.051">you&amp;#39;re created in His image you can see</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="4.44">it so where God says things like I&amp;#39;m the</text>
  <text start="285.25" dur="4.47">way the truth and the life I mean he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="287.35" dur="4.8">just he&amp;#39;s making a statement of truth to</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="4.71">you he wants you to acknowledge it and</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="4.079">come into it when we read scripture we</text>
  <text start="294.43" dur="4.07">understand doctrine we are coming into</text>
  <text start="296.229" dur="4.111">the knowledge of the Lord it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="298.5" dur="3.039">proposition okay now everyone in our</text>
  <text start="300.34" dur="5.87">culture doesn&amp;#39;t have a problem with that</text>
  <text start="301.539" dur="8.491">because culturally we worship the mind</text>
  <text start="306.21" dur="6.82">okay then we have another null which is</text>
  <text start="310.03" dur="4.919">called the knowledge for skill so now</text>
  <text start="313.03" dur="3.3">look you can read a bunch of things and</text>
  <text start="314.949" dur="3.121">not know how to do anything with it</text>
  <text start="316.33" dur="4.5">right how many of us go to college get</text>
  <text start="318.07" dur="4.44">phd&amp;#39;s behind our names when we get out</text>
  <text start="320.83" dur="3.18">we don&amp;#39;t know how to empty oil out of</text>
  <text start="322.51" dur="3.089">our car we don&amp;#39;t know how to make things</text>
  <text start="324.01" dur="4.26">to sustain life we can&amp;#39;t balance a</text>
  <text start="325.599" dur="5.481">checkbook okay so we can have one form</text>
  <text start="328.27" dur="4.98">of knowledge it&amp;#39;s just truth information</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="3.58">then there&amp;#39;s another type of knowledge</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="4.229">that the Bible talks about it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="334.66" dur="3.96">knowledge for skill now this is an arena</text>
  <text start="337.479" dur="4.801">of scripture where they talk about</text>
  <text start="338.62" dur="5.49">principles okay so there are passages in</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="3.96">scripture where it says now this is what</text>
  <text start="344.11" dur="4.35">God is like he&amp;#39;s holy an infinite</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="3.929">absolute being he has all wisdom all</text>
  <text start="348.46" dur="4.079">knowledge right now what do you do with</text>
  <text start="350.169" dur="4.74">that its information so you can</text>
  <text start="352.539" dur="3.721">comprehend the universe you live in and</text>
  <text start="354.909" dur="3.721">live in the world that God has given you</text>
  <text start="356.26" dur="3.899">but then there are scriptures a that</text>
  <text start="358.63" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ve been hearing this weekend where</text>
  <text start="360.159" dur="6.121">God says things like now look you go and</text>
  <text start="363.49" dur="7.5">heal the sick so that&amp;#39;s knowledge but it</text>
  <text start="366.28" dur="7.05">becomes a skill all right now so we</text>
  <text start="370.99" dur="5.58">realize that knowledge is also a skill</text>
  <text start="373.33" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s information that God gives us that</text>
  <text start="376.57" dur="3.99">we can walk out principles in our life</text>
  <text start="378.4" dur="4.799">and Sarah life&amp;#39;s be blessed and that we</text>
  <text start="380.56" dur="5.25">come into right order of righteousness</text>
  <text start="383.199" dur="6">in the planet that we live in okay now</text>
  <text start="385.81" dur="6.539">our American Christianity understands</text>
  <text start="389.199" dur="5.491">those two really well really well in</text>
  <text start="392.349" dur="4.111">fact most of our sermons are based on</text>
  <text start="394.69" dur="3.51">that most of our teachings are now</text>
  <text start="396.46" dur="2.97">here&amp;#39;s the knowledge of God let&amp;#39;s learn</text>
  <text start="398.2" dur="2.55">to go serve the poor here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="399.43" dur="2.79">knowledge of God let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="400.75" dur="3">do this you guys realize you hear most</text>
  <text start="402.22" dur="3.69">of your sermons are based on knowledge</text>
  <text start="403.75" dur="3.15">okay and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that</text>
  <text start="405.91" dur="2.94">you&amp;#39;re supposed to have the knowledge of</text>
  <text start="406.9" dur="3.99">the Lord but the third form of knowledge</text>
  <text start="408.85" dur="4.56">here is the one that&amp;#39;s missed most of</text>
  <text start="410.89" dur="4.2">time in our culture and Asia doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="413.41" dur="3.48">have a problem with this Mexico doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="415.09" dur="3.42">have a problem with this Africa doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="416.89" dur="3.57">have a problem with this this doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="418.51" dur="4.49">have a problem with it it&amp;#39;s only Europe</text>
  <text start="420.46" dur="5.31">and America that struggle with this and</text>
  <text start="423" dur="7.06">this knowledge is called experience</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="8.76">knowledge okay now the Bible says that</text>
  <text start="430.06" dur="7.25">for you to know fully something you have</text>
  <text start="434.53" dur="5.04">to understand the truth with your mind</text>
  <text start="437.31" dur="4.93">you have to be able to apply it into</text>
  <text start="439.57" dur="5.91">your life and you have to experience it</text>
  <text start="442.24" dur="6.42">for it to become a complete package of</text>
  <text start="445.48" dur="5.28">knowledge of the Lord okay so when the</text>
  <text start="448.66" dur="3.81">Bible says God is love they&amp;#39;re not just</text>
  <text start="450.76" dur="3.15">making a statement of truth I mean it is</text>
  <text start="452.47" dur="3.24">a statement of truth but they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="453.91" dur="4.92">something more to this how do we know</text>
  <text start="455.71" dur="5.85">God is a God of love we&amp;#39;ve experienced</text>
  <text start="458.83" dur="5.64">his love so that we can actually tell</text>
  <text start="461.56" dur="4.68">you about it and so the scripture has</text>
  <text start="464.47" dur="3.57">all three aspects of knowledge we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="466.24" dur="4.65">supposed to exalt one over the other</text>
  <text start="468.04" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re supposed to balance all three okay</text>
  <text start="470.89" dur="4.5">now in this passage right here where it</text>
  <text start="472.57" dur="5.31">says be still and know that I am God it</text>
  <text start="475.39" dur="5.21">is saying the third level of knowledge</text>
  <text start="477.88" dur="7.02">God wants you to understand be still</text>
  <text start="480.6" dur="7.27">experience him from experiencing him you</text>
  <text start="484.9" dur="6.12">learn moves you learn his heart he</text>
  <text start="487.87" dur="5.01">speaks to you he trained you he gives</text>
  <text start="491.02" dur="4.05">you principles and knowledge of his</text>
  <text start="492.88" dur="4.38">character and how to apply it in your</text>
  <text start="495.07" dur="4.02">life and so in my Christian experience</text>
  <text start="497.26" dur="5.52">in your Christian experience I am to</text>
  <text start="499.09" dur="5.97">know God through experiences this whole</text>
  <text start="502.78" dur="4.11">aspect of Christianity just amazes me</text>
  <text start="505.06" dur="3.39">where we&amp;#39;re telling everybody like you</text>
  <text start="506.89" dur="2.82">don&amp;#39;t need to have experiences in God</text>
  <text start="508.45" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s only enough that we talk about</text>
  <text start="509.71" dur="5.639">someone else&amp;#39;s experience 700 years ago</text>
  <text start="512.44" dur="6.57">I don&amp;#39;t know about you but that sounds</text>
  <text start="515.349" dur="5.49">really boring now not as it not only is</text>
  <text start="519.01" dur="6.39">it really boring it&amp;#39;s incredibly</text>
  <text start="520.839" dur="6.331">unscriptural okay so let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="525.4" dur="4.92">this learning discern the moving of the</text>
  <text start="527.17" dur="5.64">Lord all right now a lot of people know</text>
  <text start="530.32" dur="4.47">these people but some people I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="532.81" dur="3.24">running the people that have not</text>
  <text start="534.79" dur="3.45">this and so I need to make give you some</text>
  <text start="536.05" dur="3.96">references that you guys need to come</text>
  <text start="538.24" dur="3.45">into one of them is a gentleman named</text>
  <text start="540.01" dur="4.59">brother Lawrence how many of you have</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="4.65">heard this individual I I so appreciate</text>
  <text start="544.6" dur="3.45">him I gotta got in touch with him when I</text>
  <text start="546.34" dur="4.41">was in Bible College and he talks about</text>
  <text start="548.05" dur="5.1">learning to practice the presence of the</text>

  <text start="568.93" dur="6.72">easily entertain me in our culture get</text>
  <text start="572.44" dur="5.67">away from those things and rest in the</text>

  <text start="619.42" dur="6.03">at worship differently alright for me</text>
  <text start="623.13" dur="4.12">when I was trying to really connect with</text>
  <text start="625.45" dur="5.1">the spirit of the lord I was reading</text>
  <text start="627.25" dur="4.89">Ecclesiastes and it talks about young</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="3.3">men like when you come into the temple</text>
  <text start="632.14" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t say a lot because God really</text>
  <text start="633.85" dur="6.9">doesn&amp;#39;t need your knowledge learn to be</text>
  <text start="636.55" dur="5.67">quiet before the Lord now different</text>
  <text start="640.75" dur="2.76">people read that and depending on what</text>
  <text start="642.22" dur="3.45">the Lord is trying to produce in their</text>
  <text start="643.51" dur="4.2">life God really speaks to him in certain</text>
  <text start="645.67" dur="4.89">ways for me God told me the height the</text>
  <text start="647.71" dur="6.75">worship for me was to be still before</text>

  <text start="654.46" dur="4.17">idea that Jesus was talking about I can</text>
  <text start="656.11" dur="4.62">sense where the wind is blowing and what</text>
  <text start="658.63" dur="4.74">the Spirit is doing and where he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="660.73" dur="4.77">and so in my worship is nothing wrong</text>
  <text start="663.37" dur="5.07">with outward worship obviously but for</text>
  <text start="665.5" dur="6.26">me behind the worship for me is to</text>
  <text start="668.44" dur="5.64">be still before him and I become</text>
  <text start="671.76" dur="4.99">overwhelmed with his glory and his</text>
  <text start="674.08" dur="6.75">majesty and I&amp;#39;m able to behold it in a</text>
