  <text start="0" dur="4.529">hi there this is pragmatic thank you for</text>
  <text start="1.77" dur="6.48">tuning in this is my update for Saturday</text>
  <text start="4.529" dur="6.301">December 16th and we are going to</text>
  <text start="8.25" dur="5.099">continue our discussion about white hats</text>
  <text start="10.83" dur="4.59">or good people inside the department of</text>
  <text start="13.349" dur="5.1">justice and intelligence community who</text>
  <text start="15.42" dur="7.41">seemed to be leaking information to us</text>
  <text start="18.449" dur="7.441">through congressional hearings so I have</text>
  <text start="22.83" dur="5.64">a short message today much shorter than</text>
  <text start="25.89" dur="8.99">my previous messages it&amp;#39;s just a little</text>
  <text start="28.47" dur="10.679">update the latest wrinkles in the</text>
  <text start="34.88" dur="6.339">Department of Justice the FBI the Office</text>
  <text start="39.149" dur="4.021">of Inspector General how they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="41.219" dur="4.77">investigating what&amp;#39;s going on inside the</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="4.59">FBI the top levels Bruce or in the</text>
  <text start="45.989" dur="3.331">Department of Justice and these</text>
  <text start="47.76" dur="4.65">congressional hearings that are coming</text>
  <text start="49.32" dur="5.219">out where it has been my theory my</text>
  <text start="52.41" dur="4.53">belief and I get this from Sundance</text>
  <text start="54.539" dur="6.301">the last refuge on conservative tree</text>
  <text start="56.94" dur="7.259">house that the there are people there</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="5.7">are white hats good people inside and</text>
  <text start="64.199" dur="4.771">they have information and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="66.54" dur="5.34">leaking it to us through these</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="5.73">congressional hearings and so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="71.88" dur="4.16">get you caught up on what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="74.7" dur="3.57">the last 24 hours</text>
  <text start="76.04" dur="5.8">so if you&amp;#39;re following my Twitter</text>
  <text start="78.27" dur="6.389">timeline you&amp;#39;ll see me posting links to</text>
  <text start="81.84" dur="5.849">a lot of different things yeah so kind</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="7.861">of a little overview is that Sundance</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="8.331">and others on Twitter are working on</text>
  <text start="92.52" dur="7.86">this theory that Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="96.02" dur="6.69">Office of Inspector General we know that</text>
  <text start="100.38" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re currently investigating</text>
  <text start="102.71" dur="5.5">corruption in Department of Justice and</text>
  <text start="105.18" dur="5.88">FBI and we just got confirmation that</text>
  <text start="108.21" dur="7.439">the Inspector General&amp;#39;s report is due</text>
  <text start="111.06" dur="6.93">out probably March or April so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="115.649" dur="5.07">good news we now have probably a</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="4.019">timeline that we can look at for the</text>
  <text start="120.719" dur="2.76">inspector general&amp;#39;s report to come out</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="4.201">the inspector general&amp;#39;s report will</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.441">likely go to Jeff Sessions he will</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="3.48">receive the recommendation he and Rosen</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="3.36">Stein will look at the recommendations</text>
  <text start="129.69" dur="3.9">that come from the inspector general&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="131.28" dur="4.83">report and then</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="5.13">whatever disciplinary procedures or</text>
  <text start="136.11" dur="3.3">prosecution needs to happen they&amp;#39;ll make</text>
  <text start="138.72" dur="3.27">that happen</text>
  <text start="139.41" dur="4.35">so we&amp;#39;re looking at March or April as a</text>
  <text start="141.99" dur="5.46">timeline for the inspector general&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.76" dur="8.16">report to come out so that&amp;#39;s one thing</text>
  <text start="147.45" dur="8.009">to take in mind the other thing to</text>
  <text start="151.92" dur="8.06">consider that popped up in the last 24</text>
  <text start="155.459" dur="9.601">hours is after the text messages were</text>
  <text start="159.98" dur="7.539">released to members of Congress for the</text>
  <text start="165.06" dur="6.66">hearings with rod Rosenstein and Chris</text>
  <text start="167.519" dur="6.811">Rea some Democrat members of the House</text>
  <text start="171.72" dur="5.489">Judiciary Committee flipped out and they</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="5.22">went to the DOJ and demanded to know why</text>
  <text start="177.209" dur="7.891">those text messages were released who</text>
  <text start="179.55" dur="6.87">authorized it who were they reviewed to</text>
  <text start="185.1" dur="3.96">make sure they wouldn&amp;#39;t compromise a</text>
  <text start="186.42" dur="5.819">potential grand jury so there&amp;#39;s all this</text>
  <text start="189.06" dur="5.67">heartburn now on the Democrat side about</text>
  <text start="192.239" dur="3.03">why were these text messages released to</text>
  <text start="194.73" dur="3.45">the press</text>
  <text start="195.269" dur="5.19">and to Congress so there have been some</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="5.149">messages going back and forth between</text>
  <text start="200.459" dur="5.761">the Department of Justice the FBI and</text>
  <text start="203.329" dur="4.361">the Office of Inspector General and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="206.22" dur="6.6">going to just give you a quick summary</text>
  <text start="207.69" dur="8.43">so Rosen Stein was asked about the text</text>
  <text start="212.82" dur="10.139">messages being released and he said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="11.3">not with the let&amp;#39;s see he kind of punted</text>
  <text start="222.959" dur="7.471">it to another Department inside the DOJ</text>
  <text start="227.42" dur="6.099">public relations so the public relations</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="6.24">arm of the DOJ got involved and the</text>
  <text start="233.519" dur="6.75">public relations gal sent back a message</text>
  <text start="236.67" dur="7.31">a letter to the Democratic members of</text>
  <text start="240.269" dur="6.601">Congress saying that they have received</text>
  <text start="243.98" dur="6.099">permission from the Office of Inspector</text>
  <text start="246.87" dur="8.399">General to release these these text</text>
  <text start="250.079" dur="6.63">messages so at what the what the wording</text>
  <text start="255.269" dur="3.631">was the Office of Inspector General</text>
  <text start="256.709" dur="5.071">actually testified in November before</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="5.91">Congress and said we have I have no</text>
  <text start="261.78" dur="5.49">objection if you want to release this</text>
  <text start="264.81" dur="5.28">information to Congress or to the press</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="4.619">we don&amp;#39;t have any objection the Office</text>
  <text start="270.09" dur="2.549">of Inspector General said it&amp;#39;s not our</text>
  <text start="271.889" dur="2.34">not our issue</text>
  <text start="272.639" dur="4.381">you&amp;#39;re the Department of Justice you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="274.229" dur="5.641">the one that has these messages the text</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="7.17">messages were actually given to the</text>
  <text start="279.87" dur="7.139">Office of Inspector General by the DOJ</text>
  <text start="284.19" dur="4.44">and they were requested but from the FBI</text>
  <text start="287.009" dur="4.44">but FBI wouldn&amp;#39;t give them to him</text>
  <text start="288.63" dur="4.439">so because the FBI wouldn&amp;#39;t surrender</text>
  <text start="291.449" dur="4.5">the text messages the Department of</text>
  <text start="293.069" dur="4.41">Justice did they gave them to the Office</text>
  <text start="295.949" dur="3.481">of Inspector General to help them with</text>
  <text start="297.479" dur="3.69">their investigation and the Office of</text>
  <text start="299.43" dur="3.9">Inspector General said hey there your</text>
  <text start="301.169" dur="5.611">text messages what you do with them is</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="6.42">up to you it&amp;#39;s your discretion so there</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="4.68">has been some heartache going on about</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="3.539">around that issue the Office of</text>
  <text start="311.46" dur="10.97">Inspector General has said hey not our</text>
  <text start="313.289" dur="12.72">issue it&amp;#39;s your issue so the so the DOJ</text>
  <text start="322.43" dur="5.53">decided to release the text messages to</text>
  <text start="326.009" dur="4.981">members of the intelligence committees</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="7.709">Judiciary Committee and to the press so</text>
  <text start="330.99" dur="7.169">this is creating some anger among</text>
  <text start="335.669" dur="10.111">Democrats but it is what it is</text>
  <text start="338.159" dur="14.76">so our what what we&amp;#39;re assuming are</text>
  <text start="345.78" dur="11.91">operating hypothesis is that people like</text>
  <text start="352.919" dur="7.581">perhaps maybe Adam Schiff and other</text>
  <text start="357.69" dur="8.58">people on these congressional committees</text>
  <text start="360.5" dur="11.409">our leaking information to the press to</text>
  <text start="366.27" dur="9.75">try to sabotage Trump and and his what</text>
  <text start="371.909" dur="5.701">he&amp;#39;s trying to accomplish and the Office</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="6.679">of Inspector General and people in the</text>
  <text start="377.61" dur="10.77">DOJ are essentially linking information</text>
  <text start="382.699" dur="8.02">to Congress in these hearings and the</text>
  <text start="388.38" dur="4.289">Congress if it&amp;#39;s an open hearing we get</text>
  <text start="390.719" dur="5.13">to sit in and we get to listen to people</text>
  <text start="392.669" dur="5.55">like Ratcliffe Jim Jordan trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="4.861">they get to question all of these</text>
  <text start="398.219" dur="4.741">witnesses they get to question</text>
  <text start="400.71" dur="4.829">the and what they&amp;#39;ve been who they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="402.96" dur="4.76">been questioning so far is people like</text>
  <text start="405.539" dur="4.951">Chris Rea head of the FBI sessions</text>
  <text start="407.72" dur="4">Rosenstein and other people now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="410.49" dur="4.95">working their way down the chain of</text>
  <text start="411.72" dur="6.509">command and there they have other people</text>
  <text start="415.44" dur="4.77">scheduled to who they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="418.229" dur="7.141">question and the theory is that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.21" dur="9.87">working on is bring these people in</text>
  <text start="425.37" dur="7.799">front of Congress feed the congressional</text>
  <text start="430.08" dur="6.119">leaders information that will help them</text>
  <text start="433.169" dur="5.161">ask the right questions so that we can</text>
  <text start="436.199" dur="3.601">listen into the questioning and we can</text>
  <text start="438.33" dur="7.769">put two and two together and figure out</text>
  <text start="439.8" dur="9.66">where this is all going alright so we</text>
  <text start="446.099" dur="7.651">have I think we have confirmation that</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="8.84">that is the correct theory and and here</text>
  <text start="453.75" dur="11.699">is why I say that I say that because</text>
  <text start="458.3" dur="12.01">this is gets representative gets who</text>
  <text start="465.449" dur="7.981">appeared on Varney and company I think</text>
  <text start="470.31" dur="5.28">yesterday so I&amp;#39;m gonna play this video</text>
  <text start="473.43" dur="5.22">for you just really short where Varney</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="7.35">asks gets a question and he answers it</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="5.67">and his answer verifies our theory why</text>
  <text start="482.94" dur="4.14">are we going are we going to have a new</text>
  <text start="484.32" dur="4.469">investigation of the investigation what</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="4.32">what do we what tell me where are we</text>
  <text start="488.789" dur="4.47">going with this well we have thousands</text>
  <text start="491.4" dur="3.509">of dedicated and professional agents at</text>
  <text start="493.259" dur="3.9">the FBI and Department of Justice and</text>
  <text start="494.909" dur="4.98">they don&amp;#39;t deserve the stain that this</text>
  <text start="497.159" dur="4.201">investigation is brought to the FBI into</text>
  <text start="499.889" dur="3.421">the Department of Justice and that&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="501.36" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s important to get to the bottom of</text>
  <text start="503.31" dur="4.199">the corruption and the collusion that</text>
  <text start="505.38" dur="3.39">existed and that the FBI may have</text>
  <text start="507.509" dur="3.84">allowed to exist through their own</text>
  <text start="508.77" dur="4.559">personnel we are going to be doing</text>
  <text start="511.349" dur="4.141">subpoenas and interviews in the coming</text>
  <text start="513.329" dur="4.561">weeks and the Judiciary Committee expect</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="3.929">that Peter struck and his mistress we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="4.079">both be called in for sworn testimony</text>
  <text start="519.419" dur="4.74">also Bruce or one of the top officials</text>
  <text start="521.969" dur="4.74">at the Department of Justice his wife</text>
  <text start="524.159" dur="4.861">Nellie or was one of a very small number</text>
  <text start="526.709" dur="5.581">of employees at the fusion GPS company</text>
  <text start="529.02" dur="5.01">that actually gave money from the DNC to</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="3.18">Russians to dig up</text>
  <text start="534.03" dur="3.42">dirt on the president that was proven to</text>
  <text start="535.47" dur="4.17">be untrue and so when you have got the</text>
  <text start="537.45" dur="4.92">spouse of a senior Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="539.64" dur="4.56">official specifically hired to</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="3.84">facilitate this relationship between the</text>
  <text start="544.2" dur="3.63">DNC and the Russians it is a real</text>
  <text start="546.21" dur="2.97">problem we&amp;#39;re gonna be putting people</text>
  <text start="547.83" dur="3.24">under oath we&amp;#39;re gonna be getting</text>
  <text start="549.18" dur="3.78">answers and we will restore the</text>
  <text start="551.07" dur="5.51">credibility of the FBI in the Department</text>
  <text start="552.96" dur="9.93">of Justice Matt okay so this is</text>
  <text start="556.58" dur="9.76">representative Goetz and he said we are</text>
  <text start="562.89" dur="6.15">going to be putting Bruce or who is a</text>
  <text start="566.34" dur="5.37">associate attorney general who is</text>
  <text start="569.04" dur="6.6">connected to the fusion GPS dossier and</text>
  <text start="571.71" dur="6.18">his wife and potentially Bill pre step</text>
  <text start="575.64" dur="3.84">who is director of the</text>
  <text start="577.89" dur="4.26">counterintelligence division of FBI all</text>
  <text start="579.48" dur="4.41">of these people are going to be going in</text>
  <text start="582.15" dur="3.54">front of Congress they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="583.89" dur="3.51">question them they&amp;#39;re going to get them</text>
  <text start="585.69" dur="5.19">under oath and they&amp;#39;re gonna get their</text>
  <text start="587.4" dur="4.86">testimony and the questions that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="590.88" dur="3.75">going to ask in these congressional</text>
  <text start="592.26" dur="4.92">hearings is going to be based on</text>
  <text start="594.63" dur="5.64">information that comes from the DOJ or</text>
  <text start="597.18" dur="5.58">the Office of Inspector General so all</text>
  <text start="600.27" dur="7.26">of these players who are involved in</text>
  <text start="602.76" dur="7.68">this collusion in the FBI to make sure</text>
  <text start="607.53" dur="6.78">president Trump would never get elected</text>
  <text start="610.44" dur="6.11">and how he was smeared with diffusion</text>
  <text start="614.31" dur="4.77">GPS dossier and how the DOJ and FBI</text>
  <text start="616.55" dur="4.96">funded it and helped put it together</text>
  <text start="619.08" dur="4.59">that&amp;#39;s all going to be exposed in</text>
  <text start="621.51" dur="6.18">congressional hearings over the next few</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="8.73">weeks and this confirms our theory our</text>
  <text start="627.69" dur="7.59">hypothesis that people in the House</text>
  <text start="632.4" dur="5.39">Intelligence Judiciary Committees are</text>
  <text start="635.28" dur="4.86">going to get these people under oath and</text>
  <text start="637.79" dur="4.69">once you get their testimony and once</text>
  <text start="640.14" dur="3.96">you ask the right questions you can then</text>
  <text start="642.48" dur="4.05">refer them to the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="644.1" dur="4.77">for prosecution or for disciplinary</text>
  <text start="646.53" dur="5.15">action or whatever is necessary quired</text>
  <text start="648.87" dur="6.39">but that looks like that&amp;#39;s the game plan</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="5.8">moving forward is to take the</text>
  <text start="655.26" dur="4.29">information get these people under oath</text>
  <text start="657.48" dur="4.01">put them in front of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="659.55" dur="6.21">committees and find out what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="661.49" dur="5.66">so I think our working hypothesis has</text>
  <text start="665.76" dur="5.62">kind of been proven</text>
  <text start="667.15" dur="6.06">by representative Getz&amp;#39;s testimony so</text>
  <text start="671.38" dur="2.78">it&amp;#39;s all good</text>
  <text start="673.21" dur="3.51">we&amp;#39;re moving in the right direction</text>
  <text start="674.16" dur="5.38">we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re I&amp;#39;m just going to keep on</text>
  <text start="676.72" dur="4.71">following Sundance has a hot hand right</text>
  <text start="679.54" dur="4.2">now and I&amp;#39;ve been following a</text>
  <text start="681.43" dur="5.4">conservative tree house last refuge and</text>
  <text start="683.74" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;m going to continue following this</text>
  <text start="686.83" dur="3.27">line of reasoning as I come up with more</text>
  <text start="688.48" dur="3.57">information as Sundance gets more</text>
  <text start="690.1" dur="4.62">information I&amp;#39;ll continue to update</text>
  <text start="692.05" dur="4.289">everybody on what I find out but know</text>
  <text start="694.72" dur="3.71">that these congressional hearings are</text>
  <text start="696.339" dur="5.881">not a waste of time they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
