  <text start="8.809" dur="5.29">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.849" dur="4.851">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="2.601">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="29.32" dur="5.68">hi I&amp;#39;d like to welcome you to our show</text>
  <text start="31.64" dur="5.309">I&amp;#39;m your host brain medic we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="35" dur="3.96">about life as a child of God and all</text>
  <text start="36.949" dur="4.53">things related to his kingdom thanks for</text>
  <text start="38.96" dur="3">joining us if you&amp;#39;re a new listener to</text>
  <text start="41.479" dur="2.01">the show</text>
  <text start="41.96" dur="4.82">you can find articles and books and</text>
  <text start="43.489" dur="3.291">other resources on my website</text>
  <text start="63.519" dur="3">www.house.gov/paul</text>
  <text start="75.02" dur="6.12">and we talked about some things without</text>
  <text start="78.38" dur="5.84">really explaining and getting into the</text>
  <text start="81.14" dur="7.019">details of what we were talking about so</text>
  <text start="84.22" dur="6.759">I wanted to take this time to share a</text>
  <text start="88.159" dur="5.611">little bit of insight I received quite a</text>
  <text start="90.979" dur="6">few questions from people following last</text>
  <text start="93.77" dur="5.79">Monday&amp;#39;s podcast about what are altars</text>
  <text start="96.979" dur="4.621">and what are fragments that&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="99.56" dur="5.159">first of about two or three questions I</text>
  <text start="101.6" dur="6.24">want to address the terms altars and</text>
  <text start="104.719" dur="6.241">fragments are terms that are used by</text>
  <text start="107.84" dur="5.849">people who work in the ministry of inner</text>
  <text start="110.96" dur="5.85">healing and deliverance and the best way</text>
  <text start="113.689" dur="6.661">that I can explain it is that the soul</text>
  <text start="116.81" dur="7.53">the human soul has been created in such</text>
  <text start="120.35" dur="7.53">a way that it can actually be divided</text>
  <text start="124.34" dur="7.619">into compartments if you will these</text>
  <text start="127.88" dur="7.62">compartments are areas of the soul that</text>
  <text start="131.959" dur="5.461">hold on to emotions and memories now you</text>
  <text start="135.5" dur="3.93">have to think about what the soul is</text>
  <text start="137.42" dur="5.43">created for most people believe that the</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="7.44">soul is the seat of the mind the will</text>
  <text start="142.85" dur="6.979">and the emotions the emotions that</text>
  <text start="146.87" dur="4.11">people feel can be very traumatic</text>
  <text start="149.829" dur="3.821">especially</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="5.009">if those emotions are associated with</text>
  <text start="153.65" dur="6.479">things like assault and abuse and</text>
  <text start="155.989" dur="7.47">neglect and one of the things that could</text>
  <text start="160.129" dur="6.231">possibly happen to a person who suffers</text>
  <text start="163.459" dur="6.481">severe assault or neglect or abuse is</text>
  <text start="166.36" dur="6.879">the emotions that they experience can</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="5.67">dramatically impact the soul to the</text>
  <text start="173.239" dur="5.401">point where those emotions can actually</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="5.939">destroy you God has created the soul in</text>
  <text start="178.64" dur="5.25">such a way that the damage to the soul</text>
  <text start="181.549" dur="4.651">can be somewhat minimized</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="5.04">and localized to one area of the soul</text>
  <text start="186.2" dur="5.909">and this is usually what we call a</text>
  <text start="188.93" dur="7.169">fragment or an altar so essentially the</text>
  <text start="192.109" dur="6.901">soul has the ability to be separated</text>
  <text start="196.099" dur="5.931">into different sections what happens is</text>
  <text start="199.01" dur="6.66">when a person suffers emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="7.45">there is a part of the soul that takes</text>
  <text start="205.67" dur="6.569">that emotional insult and if it is</text>
  <text start="209.48" dur="5.22">severe enough that part of the soul will</text>
  <text start="212.239" dur="5.761">actually develop a separate personality</text>
  <text start="214.7" dur="6.119">that is different from the rest of the</text>
  <text start="218" dur="5.489">core of the personality and this part of</text>
  <text start="220.819" dur="5.491">the soul is either referred to or as an</text>
  <text start="223.489" dur="7.741">altar or a fragment generally speaking</text>
  <text start="226.31" dur="7.259">an altar is a part of the soul its that</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="5.819">has a distinct personality a distinct</text>
  <text start="233.569" dur="7.2">identity distinct and different feelings</text>
  <text start="237.049" dur="5.94">emotions views of the self alters can</text>
  <text start="240.769" dur="4.261">actually have their own disorders they</text>
  <text start="242.989" dur="6.06">can have their own reactions to</text>
  <text start="245.03" dur="7.41">medications altars are very well formed</text>
  <text start="249.049" dur="6.181">well-developed sub personalities of the</text>
  <text start="252.44" dur="5.159">main core of the personality and altars</text>
  <text start="255.23" dur="5.46">some of them have names some of them do</text>
  <text start="257.599" dur="5.25">not but an altar is really a sub</text>
  <text start="260.69" dur="5.49">personality that has been created by</text>
  <text start="262.849" dur="6.031">emotional trauma so when we talk about a</text>
  <text start="266.18" dur="5.669">fragment we&amp;#39;re usually talking about a</text>
  <text start="268.88" dur="6.39">much less well-developed part of the</text>
  <text start="271.849" dur="6.451">soul fragments oftentimes are only</text>
  <text start="275.27" dur="5.579">responsible for compartmentalizing and</text>
  <text start="278.3" dur="5.47">hanging on to one memory one event</text>
  <text start="280.849" dur="4.841">sometimes they only perform one task</text>
  <text start="283.77" dur="5.519">and fragments are not as well developed</text>
  <text start="285.69" dur="6.06">as altars are so when Steve and I were</text>
  <text start="289.289" dur="6.301">talking about altars and fragments we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="291.75" dur="5.49">basically talking about individual parts</text>
  <text start="295.59" dur="4.68">of the personality parts of the soul</text>
  <text start="297.24" dur="5.519">that had been created as a result of</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="5.03">emotional trauma and we&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="302.759" dur="5.31">ministering to those parts of the soul</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s what the entire ministry of inner</text>
  <text start="308.069" dur="5.401">healing is about it&amp;#39;s about identifying</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="4.54">different parts of the soul that have</text>
  <text start="313.47" dur="3.689">been fragmented whether you call them</text>
  <text start="315.72" dur="3.96">fragments or altars doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="317.159" dur="4.771">matter all that much essentially in the</text>
  <text start="319.68" dur="4.829">ministry of inner healing or trying to</text>
  <text start="321.93" dur="5.07">do is we&amp;#39;re trying to identify the</text>
  <text start="324.509" dur="4.65">altars and fragments that have been</text>
  <text start="327" dur="5.55">formed in people through emotional</text>
  <text start="329.159" dur="6.991">trauma we try to evoke a response that</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="6.6">gets them to come up and respond to us</text>
  <text start="336.15" dur="5.88">we generally introduce them to Jesus and</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="5.419">have Jesus heal them ministered to them</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="4.979">or whatever he wants to do with them I</text>
  <text start="344.569" dur="5.261">also received several questions from</text>
  <text start="347.009" dur="6.451">people by email about Steve&amp;#39;s reference</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="5.79">to claiming your healing and discussion</text>
  <text start="353.46" dur="5.07">about the Word of Faith Movement and how</text>
  <text start="355.62" dur="4.71">he was kind of you know saying that this</text>
  <text start="358.53" dur="3.66">is a problem that we have where we</text>
  <text start="360.33" dur="4.23">continue to say that we&amp;#39;re healed and</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="4.62">claiming our healing and not seeing the</text>
  <text start="364.56" dur="5.039">kind of fruit from this experience that</text>
  <text start="366.81" dur="4.53">we probably should so there was quite a</text>
  <text start="369.599" dur="3.211">bit of misunderstanding that people had</text>
  <text start="371.34" dur="3.329">over this and I&amp;#39;d like to explain that a</text>
  <text start="372.81" dur="4.889">little bit if I could I think what Steve</text>
  <text start="374.669" dur="7.711">was actually getting at is the idea that</text>
  <text start="377.699" dur="6.481">we some of us have been trained to claim</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="4.17">our healing to stand in our healing to</text>
  <text start="384.18" dur="4.41">believe that we&amp;#39;re healed and like you</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="4.79">said you know he goes look I understand</text>
  <text start="388.59" dur="5.639">what you&amp;#39;re doing how you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="391.34" dur="5.5">deny the enemy access and you&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="394.229" dur="4.981">to believe that you&amp;#39;re healed before you</text>
  <text start="396.84" dur="5.31">see it manifest and I&amp;#39;ve actually done</text>
  <text start="399.21" dur="5.97">this myself and my wife has done it but</text>
  <text start="402.15" dur="5.97">I think what Steve is getting at is we</text>
  <text start="405.18" dur="5.76">have to be certain that what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="408.12" dur="6.57">anything that we do that has to do with</text>
  <text start="410.94" dur="5.749">healing is not simply us acting like a</text>
  <text start="414.69" dur="5.149">parrot repeating thing</text>
  <text start="416.689" dur="5.34">that people have told us to say that if</text>
  <text start="419.839" dur="4.11">we&amp;#39;re actually going to be standing on</text>
  <text start="422.029" dur="4.02">our healing or declaring our healing</text>
  <text start="423.949" dur="4.77">that it is actually something the Holy</text>
  <text start="426.049" dur="5.64">Spirit has asked us to do or has</text>
  <text start="428.719" dur="5.1">directed us to do and this is where I</text>
  <text start="431.689" dur="4.171">think Steve was kind of trying to</text>
  <text start="433.819" dur="6.06">illustrate a point is there is a huge</text>
  <text start="435.86" dur="7.349">difference between sincerely believing</text>
  <text start="439.879" dur="5.46">in your heart that you are really healed</text>
  <text start="443.209" dur="5.87">and refusing to believe that the enemy</text>
  <text start="445.339" dur="6">has anything on you and the act of</text>
  <text start="449.079" dur="4.781">saying something that you&amp;#39;ve heard other</text>
  <text start="451.339" dur="3.03">people say just because they told you to</text>
  <text start="453.86" dur="3.269">say it</text>
  <text start="454.369" dur="5.431">we don&amp;#39;t actually apprehend healing by</text>
  <text start="457.129" dur="5.52">what we say we apprehend healing by what</text>
  <text start="459.8" dur="5.119">we believe and sometimes what we believe</text>
  <text start="462.649" dur="5.01">and what we say are two different things</text>
  <text start="464.919" dur="5.23">we might be saying with our mouth that</text>
  <text start="467.659" dur="5.1">we&amp;#39;re healed and by His stripes were</text>
  <text start="470.149" dur="5.04">healed but we can also be believing in</text>
  <text start="472.759" dur="4.92">our heart at the same time that were not</text>
  <text start="475.189" dur="5.31">really healed and if that&amp;#39;s the case and</text>
  <text start="477.679" dur="4.82">our words are simply us just repeating</text>
  <text start="480.499" dur="4.62">phrases that we&amp;#39;ve been told to say</text>
  <text start="482.499" dur="6.301">simply repeating phrases that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="485.119" dur="6.78">been taught to say is not enough to</text>
  <text start="488.8" dur="5.169">bring healing to someone you actually</text>
  <text start="491.899" dur="4.98">have to believe it in your heart and you</text>
  <text start="493.969" dur="4.831">have to apprehend it by faith otherwise</text>
  <text start="496.879" dur="3.06">if you&amp;#39;re saying it all you&amp;#39;re doing is</text>
  <text start="498.8" dur="3.119">repeating a phrase that you&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="499.939" dur="3.93">somebody else say and that&amp;#39;s what Steve</text>
  <text start="501.919" dur="4.5">was referring to is we can get into a</text>
  <text start="503.869" dur="4.29">mindset where we are just repeating</text>
  <text start="506.419" dur="3.39">phrases repeating things we&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="508.159" dur="5.581">people say and we don&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="509.809" dur="5.61">understand in the spirit what is going</text>
  <text start="513.74" dur="3.419">on what the dynamic is and sometimes the</text>
  <text start="515.419" dur="2.191">Holy Spirit hasn&amp;#39;t actually asked us to</text>
  <text start="517.159" dur="2.67">do that</text>
  <text start="517.61" dur="4.079">I mean I&amp;#39;m guilty of this I have a</text>
  <text start="519.829" dur="4.11">pattern of prayer that I use when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="521.689" dur="4.2">praying for people to be healed and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.939" dur="4.861">easy for me to fall into this pattern</text>
  <text start="525.889" dur="7.591">but the most effective way that I pray</text>
  <text start="528.8" dur="7.56">is when I close my eyes let my soul kind</text>
  <text start="533.48" dur="6.06">of relax and listen to what the Holy</text>
  <text start="536.36" dur="5.82">Spirit is telling me and see what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="539.54" dur="5.19">showing me and and when I pray from what</text>
  <text start="542.18" dur="4.95">the Holy Spirit is revealing I have much</text>
  <text start="544.73" dur="4.26">better success at getting people healed</text>
  <text start="547.13" dur="3.84">or getting myself filled</text>
  <text start="548.99" dur="3.96">so that&amp;#39;s the relational aspect of</text>
  <text start="550.97" dur="4.26">healing and I think really what Steve</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="4.62">was getting at is we really need to be</text>
  <text start="555.23" dur="4.98">relational in our Ministry of</text>
  <text start="557.57" dur="5">deliverance and healing and not fall</text>
  <text start="560.21" dur="5.4">into these mindsets and habits of</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="5.05">repeating phrases just because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="565.61" dur="6.78">what we&amp;#39;ve been taught to say I received</text>
  <text start="567.62" dur="7.98">another question from a woman who wanted</text>
  <text start="572.39" dur="5.94">to know more about the sexual spirits</text>
  <text start="575.6" dur="4.17">Incubus and succubus apparently she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="578.33" dur="3.63">been having some some of these attacks</text>
  <text start="579.77" dur="5.3">and didn&amp;#39;t understand what was coming</text>
  <text start="581.96" dur="7.38">from first of all we have to understand</text>
  <text start="585.07" dur="6.61">that Christians can have demons and this</text>
  <text start="589.34" dur="5.13">is a really controversial subject and</text>
  <text start="591.68" dur="7.11">I&amp;#39;m not going to go into all the details</text>
  <text start="594.47" dur="5.67">and defending my views of whether</text>
  <text start="598.79" dur="2.97">Christians going to have demons or not</text>
  <text start="600.14" dur="4.38">not in this message anyway I might do</text>
  <text start="601.76" dur="5.07">that at some point in the future but for</text>
  <text start="604.52" dur="4.38">today I would just like to say I do</text>
  <text start="606.83" dur="3.66">believe Christians can have demons I</text>
  <text start="608.9" dur="4.11">believe Christians going to have demons</text>
  <text start="610.49" dur="4.44">of every different sort and I really</text>
  <text start="613.01" dur="5.25">believe this mostly because that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="614.93" dur="6.09">my experience it&amp;#39;s extremely rare when I</text>
  <text start="618.26" dur="5.46">pray with someone that I don&amp;#39;t see some</text>
  <text start="621.02" dur="4.86">kind of DeMuth either seeing it in the</text>
  <text start="623.72" dur="5.34">spirit or the Holy Spirit reveals</text>
  <text start="625.88" dur="5.88">something about a spiritual being that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="629.06" dur="4.98">there it&amp;#39;s very common it&amp;#39;s nothing to</text>
  <text start="631.76" dur="5.7">be freaked out about all of us are</text>
  <text start="634.04" dur="7.2">subject to having demonic beings</text>
  <text start="637.46" dur="6.9">attached to us or harass us or whatever</text>
  <text start="641.24" dur="5.79">so with the sexual spirit these are</text>
  <text start="644.36" dur="4.83">actually fairly common and it&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="647.03" dur="5.25">belief that most if not all the spirits</text>
  <text start="649.19" dur="5.67">that we encounter that forms some kind</text>
  <text start="652.28" dur="5.31">of attachment to us come into our life</text>
  <text start="654.86" dur="5.61">because we have some kind of a door open</text>
  <text start="657.59" dur="5.76">in our soul that allows them to come in</text>
  <text start="660.47" dur="6.24">and there is something going on in our</text>
  <text start="663.35" dur="6.84">soul that is creating an opportunity for</text>
  <text start="666.71" dur="6.36">that spirit to be there with a sexual</text>
  <text start="670.19" dur="6.03">spirit for example there&amp;#39;s usually some</text>
  <text start="673.07" dur="5.54">it could be an emotional wound in our</text>
  <text start="676.22" dur="5.01">soul that has something to do with</text>
  <text start="678.61" dur="3.76">sexual assault or abuse from our</text>
  <text start="681.23" dur="3.02">childhood</text>
  <text start="682.37" dur="5.31">and if we&amp;#39;ve never been healed of that</text>
  <text start="684.25" dur="4.63">what happens is you have a fragment or</text>
  <text start="687.68" dur="3.75">an altar that&amp;#39;s far</text>
  <text start="688.88" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s the fragment or the altar the part</text>
  <text start="691.43" dur="4.2">of our soul that actually is the place</text>
  <text start="693.86" dur="3.66">where the demon is doing the work and</text>
  <text start="695.63" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s my belief that if we have the</text>
