  <text start="31.32" dur="6.96">26 in the book today and it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="35.309" dur="4.741">recording the testimony which is a very</text>
  <text start="38.28" dur="3.42">interesting subject it may seem boring</text>
  <text start="40.05" dur="3.779">to a lot of people but it is actually a</text>
  <text start="41.7" dur="4.62">very interesting subject I&amp;#39;m gonna have</text>
  <text start="43.829" dur="7.8">to give you a history my own history of</text>
  <text start="46.32" dur="9.6">sharing testimonies so I began praying</text>
  <text start="51.629" dur="7.59">for people to be healed in 2008 after I</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="5.909">had a dream and in the dream I met God</text>
  <text start="59.219" dur="4.051">and he told me I want you to start</text>
  <text start="61.829" dur="3.451">praying for your patients I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="63.27" dur="3.779">show you what is wrong with them and I</text>
  <text start="65.28" dur="5.4">want you to pray with them and when you</text>
  <text start="67.049" dur="6.68">do all heal him right and up until that</text>
  <text start="70.68" dur="5.79">point I did not believe in healing I</text>
  <text start="73.729" dur="4.451">started praying for people prayed for a</text>
  <text start="76.47" dur="5.399">lot of people never saw anybody healed</text>
  <text start="78.18" dur="6.66">for a long time for months even though I</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="4.831">wasn&amp;#39;t seeing anyone healed God was</text>
  <text start="84.84" dur="3.75">giving me a lot of dreams where I saw</text>
  <text start="86.7" dur="3.57">people healed in the dreams as I was</text>
  <text start="88.59" dur="5.19">praying for them in the ambulance I saw</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="5.34">them being healed so I was getting and</text>
  <text start="93.78" dur="4.14">this is I had just started having dreams</text>
  <text start="95.61" dur="5.25">- I hadn&amp;#39;t had dreams in 25 years</text>
  <text start="97.92" dur="6.239">so dreams were new to me healing was new</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="5.399">to me the miraculous was new to me and I</text>
  <text start="104.159" dur="4.621">was like a fish out of water I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="106.259" dur="5.881">know which way end was up I was just</text>
  <text start="108.78" dur="7.769">doing my best to try to obey God and I</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="6.72">kind of felt like people were going to</text>
  <text start="116.549" dur="6.21">be healed eventually if I just stuck</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="5.88">with it so I started her blog a Google</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="4.801">blog called a mobile intensive prayer</text>
  <text start="124.74" dur="4.139">unit and I was telling the stories of</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="3.72">people that I prayed with even though I</text>
  <text start="128.879" dur="3.901">wasn&amp;#39;t seeing anybody healed I was still</text>
  <text start="131.28" dur="2.22">running news stories because I thought</text>
  <text start="132.78" dur="2.97">it would be</text>
  <text start="133.5" dur="4.95">urging to other people in healthcare if</text>
  <text start="135.75" dur="4.05">they could hear about somebody who is in</text>
  <text start="138.45" dur="5.37">healthcare who is praying for their</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="6.87">patients HIPPA laws being what they are</text>
  <text start="143.82" dur="4.44">you are very restricted as to the</text>
  <text start="146.67" dur="5.43">information you can provide on your</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="5.34">patients so I blog anonymously under the</text>
  <text start="152.1" dur="3.84">name praying medic that&amp;#39;s why I chose</text>
  <text start="153.6" dur="5.28">the name praying medic because I I had</text>
  <text start="155.94" dur="4.29">to blog anonymously and I anonymize my</text>
  <text start="158.88" dur="3.99">patients and it didn&amp;#39;t give their names</text>
  <text start="160.23" dur="5.509">out any personal information because Oh</text>
  <text start="162.87" dur="7.74">HIPAA laws don&amp;#39;t want to violate those</text>
  <text start="165.739" dur="6.431">so I was writing and writing and nobody</text>
  <text start="170.61" dur="4.44">was getting healed and I was praying for</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="5.039">people and nobody was gonna heal and I</text>
  <text start="175.05" dur="3.659">just I just like I said I just knew that</text>
  <text start="177.209" dur="8.491">eventually people would get healed if I</text>
  <text start="178.709" dur="10.411">kept doing it so then people started</text>
  <text start="185.7" dur="4.98">getting healed 2009 I started seeing</text>
  <text start="189.12" dur="4.53">some miracles I started seeing some</text>
  <text start="190.68" dur="4.74">people healed in the ambulance and then</text>
  <text start="193.65" dur="3.72">nursing homes and hospitals people in at</text>
  <text start="195.42" dur="4.74">grade 4 and then Denise and I would go</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="5.22">out to grocery stores hardware stores</text>
  <text start="200.16" dur="4.049">restaurants we pray for people out in</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="3.36">the public we saw started seeing more</text>
  <text start="204.209" dur="3.951">people healed and I was running their</text>
  <text start="205.95" dur="6.89">stories and I kept blogging kept writing</text>
  <text start="208.16" dur="9.7">it was very it was very comforting to me</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="8.23">to finally see some people healed but</text>
  <text start="217.86" dur="10.7">then that is true I came upon this issue</text>
  <text start="221.07" dur="10.62">and the issue is pride in my former life</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="5.41">not like past life but in before I</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="5.94">became a believer I was a very proud and</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="7.1">arrogant person very proud and very</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="6.15">arrogant and I didn&amp;#39;t I didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="241.07" dur="7.419">these stories that I was sharing on my</text>
  <text start="243.78" dur="7.049">blog to be a source or a tool that the</text>
  <text start="248.489" dur="3.81">enemy could use to get me filled with</text>
  <text start="250.829" dur="5.13">pride because I was finally saying</text>
  <text start="252.299" dur="7.111">people heal so I kind of wrestled with</text>
  <text start="255.959" dur="6.631">this issue for several weeks and I began</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="5.34">waking up in the morning at 4:20 like</text>
  <text start="262.59" dur="3.99">every morning I would wake up look over</text>
  <text start="264.75" dur="3.72">at the clock it&amp;#39;s 4:20 in the morning</text>
  <text start="266.58" dur="4.14">I was like well what does that mean I</text>
  <text start="268.47" dur="5.759">wake up the next day look at the clock</text>
  <text start="270.72" dur="5.729">for 20 I wake up the next morning look</text>
  <text start="274.229" dur="4.731">at the clock for 20 no was not God</text>
  <text start="276.449" dur="4.911">didn&amp;#39;t want me to go smoke a doobie</text>
  <text start="278.96" dur="4.449">[Laughter]</text>
  <text start="281.36" dur="4.029">sometimes God will wake you up at a</text>
  <text start="283.409" dur="3.991">certain time and highlight the time</text>
  <text start="285.389" dur="3.68">because there&amp;#39;s a message he wants you</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="7.049">to go look through the scriptures and</text>
  <text start="289.069" dur="9.011">find the message well there was indeed a</text>
  <text start="294.449" dur="7.231">message in 420 so I started going</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="6.72">through the Bible and I came to Acts</text>
  <text start="301.68" dur="8.01">chapter 4 verse 20 you&amp;#39;re gonna know</text>
  <text start="304.8" dur="7.56">what it says alright for we cannot but</text>
  <text start="309.69" dur="8.879">Speak the things that we have seen and</text>
  <text start="312.36" dur="9.39">heard this was the Apostle Peter when</text>
  <text start="318.569" dur="6.181">the Sanhedrin the religious leaders were</text>
  <text start="321.75" dur="5.58">threatening to imprison the disciples</text>
  <text start="324.75" dur="4.56">for talking about Jesus and for talking</text>
  <text start="327.33" dur="2.97">about the healing and the miracles and</text>
  <text start="329.31" dur="1.44">the people that were being raised from</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="2.28">the dead</text>
  <text start="330.75" dur="2.849">they threatened them with beating and</text>
  <text start="332.58" dur="4.019">they threatened him with imprisonment</text>
  <text start="333.599" dur="5.37">and Peter said whether it is right to</text>
  <text start="336.599" dur="5.641">obey God or obey man</text>
  <text start="338.969" dur="4.861">you decide we must obey God for we</text>
  <text start="342.24" dur="5.25">cannot but Speak the things that we have</text>
  <text start="343.83" dur="7.38">seen and heard that was the answer to my</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="6.899">question so God was basically telling me</text>
  <text start="351.21" dur="5.699">through this experience I need you to</text>
  <text start="354.389" dur="5.791">testify of the things you have seen and</text>
  <text start="356.909" dur="9.66">heard and do it without being prideful</text>
  <text start="360.18" dur="8.669">and arrogant alright so getting getting</text>
  <text start="366.569" dur="4.021">the testimonies written down recording</text>
  <text start="368.849" dur="5.25">the testimonies people being healed is a</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="5.009">very important part of what we do you</text>
  <text start="374.099" dur="4.401">know if you look back through the Old</text>
  <text start="375.599" dur="6.511">Testament and you study the patriarchs</text>
  <text start="378.5" dur="6.88">you study Abraham and Isaac and Jacob</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="5.369">and the patriarchs of Israel whenever</text>
  <text start="385.38" dur="5.58">God did something amazing for them</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="5.521">whenever he came through they would take</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="3.629">a pile of stones they take stones and</text>
  <text start="393" dur="2.5">make a pile of stones and it would be</text>
  <text start="394.589" dur="4.091">over</text>
  <text start="395.5" dur="5.61">the stones would be a remembrance to</text>
  <text start="398.68" dur="5.7">future generations of something that God</text>
  <text start="401.11" dur="9.78">had done that was miraculous they</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="8.94">understood that having a testimony was</text>
  <text start="410.89" dur="3.96">important in fact the ark the Ark of the</text>
  <text start="413.32" dur="4.71">Covenant is also called the Ark of the</text>
  <text start="414.85" dur="5.16">testimony what was in the ark that they</text>
  <text start="418.03" dur="6.45">carried around that they Israelites</text>
  <text start="420.01" dur="8.7">carried around the staff of Moses a jar</text>
  <text start="424.48" dur="6.09">of manna and Aaron&amp;#39;s rod but Aaron&amp;#39;s rod</text>
  <text start="428.71" dur="5.49">even though it was cut off from a tree</text>
  <text start="430.57" dur="9.03">continued to sprout buds the jar of</text>
  <text start="434.2" dur="7.17">manna was a evidence of God&amp;#39;s ability to</text>
  <text start="439.6" dur="3.11">provide food for them supernaturally in</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="6.299">the wilderness for four years and</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="8.23">Aaron&amp;#39;s staff was a symbolic relic of</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="6.451">how he set them free from eat captivity</text>
  <text start="450.94" dur="7.38">in Egypt crossing the Red Sea the Ark of</text>
  <text start="454.12" dur="6.63">the testimony was a visible reminder to</text>
  <text start="458.32" dur="6.84">them who their God was and what he had</text>
  <text start="460.75" dur="7.89">done for them preserving the testimony</text>
  <text start="465.16" dur="5.37">is very important to God in fact I might</text>
  <text start="468.64" dur="4.97">say about a dream that I had all right</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="6.48">so in this dream and this is probably</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="6.27">2010 I think I had this dream where I</text>
  <text start="477.01" dur="6.03">was going around to various people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="7.75">houses and apartments and I was</text>
  <text start="483.04" dur="6.54">recording their testimonies of something</text>
  <text start="487.63" dur="4.17">miraculous that God had done for them in</text>
  <text start="489.58" dur="5.339">some cases it was financial miracles in</text>
  <text start="491.8" dur="6.21">other cases it was healing but I was</text>
  <text start="494.919" dur="6.06">recording their testimonies right and I</text>
  <text start="498.01" dur="4.86">had to get down all the details and I</text>
  <text start="500.979" dur="4.741">knew in the dream this was extremely</text>
  <text start="502.87" dur="4.62">important to God he wanted their</text>
  <text start="505.72" dur="3.29">testimonies preserved and the</text>
  <text start="507.49" dur="3.96">interesting thing about the dream was</text>
  <text start="509.01" dur="6.85">some of these testimonies that I was</text>
  <text start="511.45" dur="6.389">writing down were copies of testimonies</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="5.22">that had previously been recorded but</text>
  <text start="517.839" dur="6.361">had been lost and God did not want any</text>
  <text start="521.08" dur="5.73">of these testimonies to be lost it was</text>
  <text start="524.2" dur="3.37">very important to him to have these</text>
  <text start="526.81" dur="7.63">testimony</text>
  <text start="527.57" dur="12.15">preserved so you know it is it is very</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="7.38">important to God that we preserve and we</text>
  <text start="539.72" dur="4.95">share the testimonies of what God has</text>
  <text start="541.82" dur="5.34">done it is incumbent upon us it is I</text>
  <text start="544.67" dur="4.5">can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t stress how important is if</text>
  <text start="547.16" dur="4.41">God has done something miraculous for</text>
  <text start="549.17" dur="5.07">you God has done something amazing if he</text>
  <text start="551.57" dur="4.74">has shown you some revelation about life</text>
  <text start="554.24" dur="4.83">he has given you some wisdom if he has</text>
  <text start="556.31" dur="6.26">healed you if he is taking care of a</text>
  <text start="559.07" dur="6.03">financial disaster you know unexpectedly</text>
  <text start="562.57" dur="4.45">came up with something that helped you</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="3.81">out it is incredibly important for you</text>
  <text start="567.02" dur="4.41">not to just to remember what he has done</text>
  <text start="568.91" dur="8.13">but to share that testimony with other</text>
  <text start="571.43" dur="9">people it is it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s our good pleasure</text>
  <text start="577.04" dur="6.3">as children of God to share with the</text>
  <text start="580.43" dur="6.69">world the things that he does why is</text>
  <text start="583.34" dur="7.56">there why is there unbelief in the world</text>
  <text start="587.12" dur="5.73">about God I think a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="590.9" dur="3.81">skeptical about the existence of God or</text>
  <text start="592.85" dur="3.63">the goodness of God because people like</text>
  <text start="594.71" dur="10.59">us for not sharing the testimonies of</text>
  <text start="596.48" dur="11.61">the things that he does and yes oh just</text>
  <text start="605.3" dur="6.87">a coincidence you know probably you know</text>
  <text start="608.09" dur="7.71">just wishful thinking maybe the placebo</text>
  <text start="612.17" dur="5.76">effect yeah maybe not maybe God is</text>
  <text start="615.8" dur="6.74">actually it actually does miraculous</text>
  <text start="617.93" dur="13.59">works like it says he does in the Bible</text>
  <text start="622.54" dur="13.35">alright so if if you become stuck in</text>
  <text start="631.52" dur="8.4">pride while sharing the testimonies</text>
  <text start="635.89" dur="8.38">that&amp;#39;s your problem right and I actually</text>
  <text start="639.92" dur="10.89">share this story I&amp;#39;ve I have learned</text>
  <text start="644.27" dur="8.37">healing mostly by following the watching</text>
  <text start="650.81" dur="4.05">the testimonies of people who are</text>
