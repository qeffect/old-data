  <text start="14.28" dur="3.57">such an awesome story</text>
  <text start="15.48" dur="7.86">and one of the reasons I remembered it</text>
  <text start="17.85" dur="7.259">is I had never heard of this that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="23.34" dur="3.75">happened is in her story is the only</text>
  <text start="25.109" dur="4.621">person I could think laymen I know where</text>
  <text start="27.09" dur="4.769">that and and John Paul actually came out</text>
  <text start="29.73" dur="4.32">of you know in Protestant and we&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="31.859" dur="3.54">been around five hundred years but the</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="4.079">Church of Jesus Christ is much older</text>
  <text start="35.399" dur="4.611">than that yeah and and particularly</text>
  <text start="38.129" dur="5.011">within Protestant with it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="40.01" dur="9.61">historic cessationism it&amp;#39;s had a very</text>
  <text start="43.14" dur="8.37">relatively short time with a weather</text>
  <text start="49.62" dur="4.38">more the church was open to the gifts of</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="5.22">the Spirit and everything but it was</text>
  <text start="54" dur="6.149">about being transported and Bible cache</text>
  <text start="56.73" dur="6.059">and by location and I I started reading</text>
  <text start="60.149" dur="4.65">about three years ago a lot of mystical</text>
  <text start="62.789" dur="4.351">theology from the Roman Catholic Church</text>
  <text start="64.799" dur="4.081">and I came across things at Weymouth</text>

  <text start="373.01" dur="3.689">through me I want I want to feel the</text>
  <text start="374.99" dur="3.72">weight of his hand I want to feel the</text>

  <text start="391.34" dur="5.53">healed so he lays his hands on my hand</text>
  <text start="394.4" dur="5.44">and the best way I can describe it is</text>
  <text start="396.87" dur="5.97">this liquid thick substance like honey</text>
  <text start="399.84" dur="5.07">hot honey that&amp;#39;s how thick it was I</text>
  <text start="402.84" dur="4.53">didn&amp;#39;t see it but that&amp;#39;s it felt the</text>
  <text start="404.91" dur="4.53">thickness of honey it it went through my</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="4.92">hands it went through my belly it</text>
  <text start="409.44" dur="5.07">entered in the meal and like a scroll it</text>
  <text start="412.29" dur="5.37">began to slowly unroll down my waist and</text>
  <text start="414.51" dur="5.939">slowly unroll up my chest just slowly</text>
  <text start="417.66" dur="5.94">and as it did I could I could literally</text>
  <text start="420.449" dur="5.701">feel it rolling inside of me and as it</text>
  <text start="423.6" dur="4.83">did the behind the scroll was was no</text>
  <text start="426.15" dur="5.04">pain and part of the scroll was great</text>
  <text start="428.43" dur="4.86">pain and swelling</text>
  <text start="431.19" dur="4.53">it eventually rolled out the bottom of</text>
  <text start="433.29" dur="5.189">my feet it rolled out the top of my head</text>
  <text start="435.72" dur="4.86">and I was instantly healed just just</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="4.141">instantly healed and I&amp;#39;m looking at the</text>
  <text start="440.58" dur="4.89">man he&amp;#39;s smiling at me</text>
  <text start="442.62" dur="4.53">I&amp;#39;m smiling in him I didn&amp;#39;t take my eyes</text>
  <text start="445.47" dur="4.14">off of him he was pretty much the focus</text>
  <text start="447.15" dur="5.67">of my attention at that moment and right</text>
  <text start="449.61" dur="7.38">in front of my eyes Randy he disappeared</text>
  <text start="452.82" dur="6.93">he just he just disappeared and I jumped</text>
  <text start="456.99" dur="4.35">out of my bed and I said lord thank you</text>
  <text start="459.75" dur="3.06">for sending your angel to heal me thank</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="3.27">you for sending your angel the healing</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;m going to the conference I&amp;#39;m healed</text>
  <text start="464.61" dur="4.35">and I hear the audible voice of God</text>
  <text start="467.07" dur="6.45">Randy I heard the audible voice of God</text>
  <text start="468.96" dur="8.25">and he says I didn&amp;#39;t send an angel I was</text>
  <text start="473.52" dur="6.869">shocked I literally fell to the floor</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="5.639">and I thought the devil healed me God</text>
  <text start="480.389" dur="5.551">not begin to pray Lord the the devil</text>
  <text start="482.849" dur="4.861">healed you let the devil heal me why did</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="2.37">you do that I wasn&amp;#39;t complaining that</text>

  <text start="494.94" dur="3.63">better do and you let the devil human</text>
  <text start="497.22" dur="3.6">you could have stopped him and you</text>
  <text start="498.57" dur="6.21">didn&amp;#39;t him now I&amp;#39;m gonna die I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="500.82" dur="8.19">die I&amp;#39;m gonna die and so I wake up the</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="6.54">floor complaining aching they widened</text>

  <text start="511.32" dur="4.529">stealer destroyer now he&amp;#39;s done</text>
  <text start="513.63" dur="5.159">destroyed me and you let him do it and</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="4.591">then I hear the voice almost at the</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="4.17">voice of the Lord I mean he was laughing</text>
  <text start="520.44" dur="7.2">but it was like humor in this tone and</text>
  <text start="522.959" dur="6.721">he said it wasn&amp;#39;t him just out of me so</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="7.53">clearly it wasn&amp;#39;t him</text>
