  <text start="8.78" dur="5.29">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.849" dur="4.79">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.07" dur="2.569">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="17.41" dur="4.27">are there any news stories that have</text>
  <text start="19.88" dur="3.17">kind of perked you guys&amp;#39; ears over the</text>
  <text start="21.68" dur="4.17">last few days that we want to talk about</text>
  <text start="23.05" dur="7.78">thing that I&amp;#39;ve been focusing mostly on</text>
  <text start="25.85" dur="9.69">myself is this sea state war against the</text>
  <text start="30.83" dur="7.29">president and the daily volleys back and</text>
  <text start="35.54" dur="4.65">forth and Edinson such as the deep</text>
  <text start="38.12" dur="4.05">stated the media mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="40.19" dur="3.63">going after the president very</text>
  <text start="42.17" dur="2.76">interesting watching the New York Times</text>
  <text start="43.82" dur="3.96">in Washington Post</text>
  <text start="44.93" dur="6.74">leaking stories from inside the</text>
  <text start="47.78" dur="6.869">investigation at the FBI in the DOJ and</text>
  <text start="51.67" dur="5.53">how they&amp;#39;ve been kind of systematically</text>
  <text start="54.649" dur="5.16">trying to pin down Trump and his</text>
  <text start="57.2" dur="4.65">administration with these stories</text>
  <text start="59.809" dur="4.441">how many administration&amp;#39;s fighting back</text>
  <text start="61.85" dur="5.58">to me it&amp;#39;s been a fascinating thing to</text>
  <text start="64.25" dur="5.85">watch it has knitting and I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="67.43" dur="4.53">one of the reasons why I actually voted</text>
  <text start="70.1" dur="3.629">for Trump not because I liked him</text>
  <text start="71.96" dur="4.409">because I was kind of scared of him but</text>
  <text start="73.729" dur="4.861">one of the reasons why I voted for him</text>
  <text start="76.369" dur="5.701">it was first off I hated gary johnson</text>
  <text start="78.59" dur="5.34">and bill weld and as a libertarian they</text>
  <text start="82.07" dur="4.47">weren&amp;#39;t very libertarian and I just</text>
  <text start="83.93" dur="5.93">could not bring myself to vote for them</text>
  <text start="86.54" dur="6.45">so I ended up voting for the</text>
  <text start="89.86" dur="4.689">authoritarian I guess you could say but</text>
  <text start="92.99" dur="3.54">it is kind of interesting to watch</text>
  <text start="94.549" dur="4.14">because he is basically bringing</text>
  <text start="96.53" dur="4.199">Washington to its knees and that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="98.689" dur="4.081">of what I was hoping for yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="100.729" dur="4.171">what my friends who are libertarian a</text>
  <text start="102.77" dur="3.989">lot of them ended up voting for Trump</text>
  <text start="104.9" dur="3.96">because they just didn&amp;#39;t like Hillary</text>
  <text start="106.759" dur="5.22">didn&amp;#39;t trust her and they thought okay</text>
  <text start="108.86" dur="6.829">Trump has been talking about decreasing</text>
  <text start="111.979" dur="6.421">the federal budget reining in all the</text>
  <text start="115.689" dur="4.831">excess of expense and regulation and</text>
  <text start="118.4" dur="4.029">that</text>
  <text start="120.52" dur="4.379">- good - a lot of libertarians and</text>
  <text start="122.429" dur="5.561">mostly one that I know who voted for him</text>
  <text start="124.899" dur="4.681">are pretty happy I mean Trump can come</text>
  <text start="127.99" dur="5.31">up and looking like an authoritarian</text>
  <text start="129.58" dur="7.019">which kind of scares libertarians but</text>
  <text start="133.3" dur="4.71">his fiscal policy has been really I</text>
  <text start="136.599" dur="4.011">think well-received by a lot of</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="6.119">libertarians he&amp;#39;s cutting a lot of</text>
  <text start="140.61" dur="5.2">departments and the budgets and state</text>
  <text start="144.129" dur="6.061">departments and a lot of other ones that</text>
  <text start="145.81" dur="7.769">are probably with a lot of waste so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.19" dur="4.769">keeping those campaign promises to you</text>
  <text start="153.579" dur="3.99">know shrink government which i think is</text>
  <text start="154.959" dur="4.771">great and he&amp;#39;s also pulled out of the Oh</text>
  <text start="157.569" dur="5.941">was the Paris Accords or the Paris</text>
  <text start="159.73" dur="5.729">treaty or whatever that oh basically</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;d have to pay to clean up everybody</text>
  <text start="165.459" dur="6.39">else&amp;#39;s Minister some yeah change like</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="4.829">that but yeah a lot of obviously a lot</text>
  <text start="171.849" dur="3.511">of environmentalists are pretty unhappy</text>
  <text start="173.799" dur="3.75">about that but if you actually look at</text>
  <text start="175.36" dur="4.92">what the Paris Accord the wording of it</text>
  <text start="177.549" dur="4.591">it was it was a bad deal it allowed a</text>
  <text start="180.28" dur="5.73">lot of nations to continue to increase</text>
  <text start="182.14" dur="6.629">pollution and it thought it would cost</text>
  <text start="186.01" dur="3.78">us a lot of money if he actually ended</text>
  <text start="188.769" dur="3.391">up paying the money that we were</text>
  <text start="189.79" dur="4.41">supposed to pay so it was kind of</text>
  <text start="192.16" dur="4.53">pointless and I&amp;#39;m glad he got us out of</text>
  <text start="194.2" dur="4.439">it well I&amp;#39;m glad that he pulled us out</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="3.96">of the Paris Accords honestly because I</text>
  <text start="198.639" dur="3.781">thought the Paris Accords were a waste</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="4.739">of time and it&amp;#39;s not necessarily that</text>
  <text start="202.42" dur="5.099">I&amp;#39;m a climate change denier but a kind</text>
  <text start="205.389" dur="4.35">of an because I don&amp;#39;t think Humanity is</text>
  <text start="207.519" dur="5.431">big enough to have such a big massive</text>
  <text start="209.739" dur="5.58">impact on the environment in the way</text>
  <text start="212.95" dur="5.58">that they&amp;#39;re trying to make it sound so</text>
  <text start="215.319" dur="7.29">in my opinion I think it was a wasted</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="6.87">bad deal it was very expensive and I</text>
  <text start="222.609" dur="6.331">have a few friends of mine that were you</text>
  <text start="225.4" dur="5.489">know I guess you could say kind of Peter</text>
  <text start="228.94" dur="3.78">the line between libertarian and Barry</text>
  <text start="230.889" dur="5.341">Sanders which I have no idea how you</text>
  <text start="232.72" dur="5.129">Peter that line but they were pretty</text>
  <text start="236.23" dur="5.909">upset about it I&amp;#39;ve got a friend of mine</text>
  <text start="237.849" dur="7.621">who is like a big Tesla SpaceX nerd and</text>
  <text start="242.139" dur="5.311">he basically was just like outraged over</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="3.6">the fact that we pulled out of it when</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="3.539">in fact all it was doing was it was</text>
  <text start="249.07" dur="3.87">forcing us to decrease our pollution</text>
  <text start="250.989" dur="2.441">while allowing places like China and</text>
  <text start="252.94" dur="3.729">India</text>
  <text start="253.43" dur="4.829">to allow their pollution to continue</text>
  <text start="256.669" dur="3.63">climbing because they&amp;#39;re technically</text>
  <text start="258.259" dur="4.651">considered a growing Society although</text>
  <text start="260.299" dur="4.021">China is massive by comparison to the</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="4.08">United States so I don&amp;#39;t understand how</text>
  <text start="264.32" dur="5.4">they got that well not only that their</text>
  <text start="266.99" dur="5.399">pollution is you know our pollution is</text>
  <text start="269.72" dur="4.41">minuscule compared to China&amp;#39;s at least I</text>
  <text start="272.389" dur="4.081">can walk outside and breathe my air</text>
  <text start="274.13" dur="4.94">without you know having a covered over</text>
  <text start="276.47" dur="7.86">the face master something because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="279.07" dur="8.95">24/7 smog um but I I echo what you said</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="5.399">about the bottle being a not a climate</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="4.649">change denier but a man-made climate</text>
  <text start="289.729" dur="4.891">change denier climate of the common</text>
  <text start="292.669" dur="5.581">around the world has changed since the</text>
  <text start="294.62" dur="5.37">beginning of time and if you think that</text>
  <text start="298.25" dur="3.15">we have anything to do with it you need</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="5.1">to go outside and look at the Sun</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="5.609">because that&amp;#39;s essentially blaming an</text>
  <text start="305.09" dur="5.699">anthill for the magnifying glasses</text>
  <text start="307.009" dur="6.991">burning the place up but we we honestly</text>
  <text start="310.789" dur="6.181">don&amp;#39;t have anything in a significant</text>
  <text start="314" dur="4.83">impact to do with the climate change so</text>
  <text start="316.97" dur="4.79">I think we&amp;#39;ve found our title for this</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="6">episode something I don&amp;#39;t anthill</text>
  <text start="321.76" dur="4.33">arguing with a magnifying glass okay</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="4.5">very good</text>
  <text start="326.09" dur="5.79">my thoughts on on climate change are a</text>
  <text start="329.33" dur="5.49">little bit more along that yeah we need</text>
  <text start="331.88" dur="5.789">to be better stewards of everything we</text>
  <text start="334.82" dur="6.569">have our hands on but I don&amp;#39;t think like</text>
  <text start="337.669" dur="5.551">you know were the ones causing the</text>
  <text start="341.389" dur="4.891">so-called climate change like as much as</text>
  <text start="343.22" dur="5.879">as you know some of the people who are</text>
  <text start="346.28" dur="4.889">advocates of it claim like that we need</text>
  <text start="349.099" dur="5.13">to have these Paris Accords we have to</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="5.191">have these carbon taxes and stuff but</text>
  <text start="354.229" dur="4.44">one thing I&amp;#39;d love if anyone listening</text>
  <text start="356.36" dur="6.63">to this it applies to them is if we</text>
  <text start="358.669" dur="9.72">stopped using it was cold where I live</text>
  <text start="362.99" dur="7.44">today as for not believing in the</text>
  <text start="368.389" dur="4.731">climate you know is there some coal</text>
  <text start="370.43" dur="6.39">today in the middle of January in like</text>
  <text start="373.12" dur="6.549">Montana and so we post our memes about</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="6.089">how climate change is fake like to me</text>
  <text start="379.669" dur="6.211">that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not the best defense</text>
  <text start="382.909" dur="4.051">you know because I could say you know</text>
  <text start="385.88" dur="2.97">the opposite</text>
  <text start="386.96" dur="4.44">where I am down here in South America</text>
  <text start="388.85" dur="4.74">where we have like extremely hot days</text>
  <text start="391.4" dur="4.22">but anyway that&amp;#39;s just my little pet</text>
  <text start="393.59" dur="5.49">peeve when I see the topic to come up</text>
  <text start="395.62" dur="5.949">well my mind really is just the fact</text>
  <text start="399.08" dur="4.86">that you know when I was much younger in</text>
  <text start="401.569" dur="4.35">Steven Steven are about the same age I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="403.94" dur="4.68">not really sure how much how old David</text>
  <text start="405.919" dur="5.071">is but uh when I was a kid they were</text>
  <text start="408.62" dur="5.37">talking about we were going to be going</text>
  <text start="410.99" dur="6.78">through an ice age in 30 to 50 years and</text>
  <text start="413.99" dur="6.149">we were reading it in our books that a</text>
  <text start="417.77" dur="4.98">mini ice age was coming and they made</text>
  <text start="420.139" dur="4.59">movies that were fear-mongering about</text>
  <text start="422.75" dur="3.87">that then all of a sudden the 90s it</text>
  <text start="424.729" dur="4.171">became about global warming and of</text>
  <text start="426.62" dur="4.41">course Al Gore got ahold of it and I</text>
  <text start="428.9" dur="5.01">think he released an inconvenient truth</text>
  <text start="431.03" dur="6.81">in what 2001 2002 and then it just got</text>
  <text start="433.91" dur="5.55">kind of exploded from there and it</text>
  <text start="437.84" dur="3.69">became about y&amp;#39;all know the world&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.46" dur="3.78">going to end because the the ice caps</text>
  <text start="441.53" dur="3.359">are going to melt and the glaciers are</text>
  <text start="443.24" dur="3.84">going to melt and all that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="444.889" dur="4.861">and then all of a sudden well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="4.44">become not very well proven because a</text>
  <text start="449.75" dur="2.849">lot of the climate stations were</text>
  <text start="451.52" dur="3.51">actually sitting in the middle of</text>
  <text start="452.599" dur="4.831">asphalt parking lots and that&amp;#39;s why they</text>
  <text start="455.03" dur="4.379">were actually like picking up increases</text>
  <text start="457.43" dur="4.859">in temperature so then they changed it</text>
  <text start="459.409" dur="5.221">to climate change because they can&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="462.289" dur="4.801">know tell whether or not it&amp;#39;s going one</text>
  <text start="464.63" dur="5.46">way or the other and they&amp;#39;re blaming it</text>
  <text start="467.09" dur="5.549">all on humanity you know honestly if you</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="5.73">go out to a field of cows they release</text>
  <text start="472.639" dur="6.03">more methane and and carbon dioxide than</text>
  <text start="475.82" dur="4.7">a human can in a lifetime you know so I</text>
  <text start="478.669" dur="4.68">just don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s really a</text>
  <text start="480.52" dur="5.32">something that we are in control of</text>
  <text start="483.349" dur="5.04">personally yeah if you look back</text>
  <text start="485.84" dur="5.16">historically at about just the volcanic</text>
  <text start="488.389" dur="4.56">activity in the earth over the last</text>
  <text start="491" dur="4.949">probably a couple thousand years there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="492.949" dur="5.4">been a lot more co2 and greenhouse gases</text>
  <text start="495.949" dur="6.541">released just from volcanoes than</text>
  <text start="498.349" dur="6.81">anything man has ever done to put co2</text>
  <text start="502.49" dur="5.729">into the air but the issues that I have</text>
  <text start="505.159" dur="6.181">with climate change number one I have a</text>
  <text start="508.219" dur="4.32">solar hot water heater and if I get to a</text>
  <text start="511.34" dur="3.42">place where have enough money I would</text>
  <text start="512.539" dur="3.99">like to buy enough solar panels where I</text>
  <text start="514.76" dur="4.57">could run my entire house off the grid</text>
  <text start="516.529" dur="5.26">and just run on solar I&amp;#39;m totally about</text>
  <text start="519.33" dur="5.37">solar and a game of in Phoenix so we had</text>
  <text start="521.789" dur="3.931">like 95% sunshine all year long thing</text>
  <text start="524.7" dur="5.46">that I have the biggest concern about</text>
  <text start="525.72" dur="7.26">with people who are pushing the things</text>
  <text start="530.16" dur="5.19">like the Paris Accord is they fail to</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="5.16">look at all of the things that are going</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="6.479">out of this and one of the big things</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="6.21">that concerns me is the carbon taxes are</text>
  <text start="541.829" dur="5.25">essentially a kind of a market that has</text>
  <text start="544.35" dur="6.21">been set up where a group of people are</text>
  <text start="547.079" dur="6.811">able to charge money to utilities and</text>
  <text start="550.56" dur="5.459">states and nations for how much co2</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re putting into the air and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="556.019" dur="5.341">a profit incentive Al Gore and his</text>
  <text start="559.14" dur="4.56">buddies have set this system up where</text>
  <text start="561.36" dur="4.77">they all get to profit off of the</text>
  <text start="563.7" dur="5.37">pollution that is being put out there I</text>
  <text start="566.13" dur="5.49">have friends who live in Canada who</text>
  <text start="569.07" dur="4.65">their electric bills are skyrocketing</text>
  <text start="571.62" dur="4.44">over the last couple of years because of</text>
  <text start="573.72" dur="4.739">the carbon tax that Canadians are being</text>
  <text start="576.06" dur="3.93">charged there is this profit motive</text>
  <text start="578.459" dur="3.69">behind this whole thing that really</text>
  <text start="579.99" dur="5.969">bothers me anytime there&amp;#39;s a profit</text>
  <text start="582.149" dur="6.301">motive for something I&amp;#39;m suspect and you</text>
  <text start="585.959" dur="5.37">know I know the argument that you know</text>
  <text start="588.45" dur="5.43">95 percent of scientists agree it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="591.329" dur="5.041">man-made climate change is real well a</text>
  <text start="593.88" dur="5.1">lot of that research is an astroturf</text>
  <text start="596.37" dur="4.26">this is the same thing whether you talk</text>
  <text start="598.98" dur="4.74">about climate change whether you talk</text>
  <text start="600.63" dur="6.06">about evolution and paleontology or</text>
  <text start="603.72" dur="5.88">biology or genetics there are people who</text>
  <text start="606.69" dur="5.91">work in colleges and universities to do</text>
  <text start="609.6" dur="5.25">research and the only way that you can</text>
  <text start="612.6" dur="3.69">get paid to do your research is if you</text>
  <text start="614.85" dur="5.46">have a theory that you&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="616.29" dur="5.039">prove these universities rely on grants</text>
  <text start="620.31" dur="3.779">from the government and other agencies</text>
  <text start="621.329" dur="4.141">to do this research and what they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="645.12" dur="6.03">discussion that suggests that those</text>

  <text start="651.15" dur="4.1">their grasp it would lose their research</text>
  <text start="653.16" dur="4.65">funding they would be out of work and</text>
  <text start="655.25" dur="5.1">all the people who are doing research on</text>
  <text start="657.81" dur="5.61">these subjects have a vested interest in</text>
  <text start="660.35" dur="6.22">promoting that merited because it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="663.42" dur="5.4">bread and butter it is their income so</text>
  <text start="666.57" dur="4.05">when you look at research and look at</text>
  <text start="668.82" dur="3.18">science it&amp;#39;s tough you have to look at</text>
  <text start="670.62" dur="3.45">all of it and you have to ask yourself</text>
  <text start="672" dur="4.74">do these people have a vested interest</text>
  <text start="674.07" dur="4.83">what&amp;#39;s their end game their end game is</text>
  <text start="676.74" dur="5.28">to put food on the table lately they do</text>
  <text start="678.9" dur="5.82">that by doing this research and they</text>
  <text start="682.02" dur="5.22">count on that research to continue so</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s just a lot of things about this</text>
  <text start="687.24" dur="4.32">whole discussion that I am a little bit</text>
  <text start="689.52" dur="3.84">suspicious about well there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="691.56" dur="6.029">things that are controlled by those two</text>
  <text start="693.36" dur="7.62">very very very powerful things in in our</text>
  <text start="697.589" dur="5.641">society and that is money and power you</text>
  <text start="700.98" dur="5.01">know so you have the politicians who are</text>
  <text start="703.23" dur="5.76">pushing the narrative not because they</text>
  <text start="705.99" dur="6.09">necessarily want the money they want the</text>
  <text start="708.99" dur="4.469">power to control people&amp;#39;s lives and then</text>
  <text start="712.08" dur="3.78">you have the researchers and the</text>
  <text start="713.459" dur="4.231">scientists who rely on the grants and</text>
  <text start="715.86" dur="3.69">the financing from the government and</text>
  <text start="717.69" dur="4.44">private organizations and things like</text>
  <text start="719.55" dur="4.2">that that will not fund it unless it is</text>
  <text start="722.13" dur="4.25">actually like trying to prove the</text>
  <text start="723.75" dur="5.25">narrative that they believe so you know</text>
  <text start="726.38" dur="5.17">anytime I&amp;#39;ve brought that up with some</text>
  <text start="729" dur="4.65">of my environmentalist liberal friends</text>
  <text start="731.55" dur="4.92">they usually get upset and they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="733.65" dur="5.309">will explain to me why a poor scientist</text>
  <text start="736.47" dur="4.02">needs money well that&amp;#39;s exactly why they</text>
  <text start="738.959" dur="3.961">need the money to continue financing</text>
  <text start="740.49" dur="4.61">their research and those that are</text>
  <text start="742.92" dur="5.039">actually researching things that are not</text>
  <text start="745.1" dur="6.01">global warming or evolution or whatever</text>
  <text start="747.959" dur="4.231">are not even actually being financed and</text>
  <text start="751.11" dur="4.19">that&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why you have</text>
  <text start="752.19" dur="6">that 95 97 percent of people that agree</text>
  <text start="755.3" dur="6.31">that global warming or climate change is</text>
  <text start="758.19" dur="5.43">real the scientists out there that are</text>
  <text start="761.61" dur="4.62">actually investigating other causes or</text>
  <text start="763.62" dur="4.35">other issues aren&amp;#39;t actually included in</text>
  <text start="766.23" dur="4.59">that because they&amp;#39;re not considered</text>
  <text start="767.97" dur="4.52">scientist by our government because</text>
  <text start="770.82" dur="5.99">they&amp;#39;re not actually getting financing</text>
  <text start="772.49" dur="7.69">and grants if that makes sense</text>
  <text start="776.81" dur="5.29">that and also the quote-unquote climate</text>
  <text start="780.18" dur="4.56">change deniers are being pushed out of</text>
  <text start="782.1" dur="5.31">the Institute right now by those no</text>
  <text start="784.74" dur="5.91">coming no bring go and bring data that</text>
  <text start="787.41" dur="5.46">doesn&amp;#39;t meet the agenda and essentially</text>
  <text start="790.65" dur="5.22">they get they get pushed out like it has</text>
  <text start="792.87" dur="4.98">made tenure so yet fired her they get</text>
  <text start="795.87" dur="4.65">bullied out of office of how when I used</text>
  <text start="797.85" dur="5.429">to listen to a lot of talk radio I heard</text>
  <text start="800.52" dur="4.68">taunts and stories about that but also</text>
  <text start="803.279" dur="4.621">you have to think of the agenda behind a</text>
  <text start="805.2" dur="6.36">lot of politicians care so much about</text>
  <text start="807.9" dur="5.31">climate change why are they forcing so</text>
  <text start="811.56" dur="4.92">much money into the Institute&amp;#39;s to prove</text>
  <text start="813.21" dur="6.3">climate change is real and and well</text>
  <text start="816.48" dur="4.83">what&amp;#39;s the endgame basically and I heard</text>
  <text start="819.51" dur="4.019">someone put it like this one time if</text>
  <text start="821.31" dur="4.83">they can convince you that you are the</text>
  <text start="823.529" dur="5.421">problem you can that they can get you to</text>
  <text start="826.14" dur="5.67">do anything they want you to do anything</text>
  <text start="828.95" dur="4.27">so they&amp;#39;re convincing humans that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="831.81" dur="4.29">the problem that we&amp;#39;re causing the</text>
  <text start="833.22" dur="4.559">climate change and thus they can make us</text>
  <text start="836.1" dur="5.1">basically do whatever they want us to do</text>
  <text start="837.779" dur="6.211">well you know as libertarians that the</text>
  <text start="841.2" dur="7.05">whole issue with governments and larger</text>
  <text start="843.99" dur="7.05">more expensive government is they want</text>
  <text start="848.25" dur="4.65">to take our tax money and make a big</text>
  <text start="851.04" dur="3.69">living off of it and bring their friends</text>
  <text start="852.9" dur="3.66">in and have them live off the tax money</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="4.14">and the only way government can really</text>
  <text start="856.56" dur="6.029">do that is to create problems and then</text>
  <text start="858.87" dur="7.17">create solutions and that&amp;#39;s the issue</text>
  <text start="862.589" dur="6.661">with socialism is it creates all these</text>
  <text start="866.04" dur="5.549">problems or points to problems or</text>
  <text start="869.25" dur="4.8">illustrates problems and then suggests</text>
  <text start="871.589" dur="5.041">that if we have these people these</text>
  <text start="874.05" dur="4.83">organizations agencies we will come up</text>
  <text start="876.63" dur="4.05">with a solution and it isn&amp;#39;t it is in</text>
  <text start="878.88" dur="3.57">the government&amp;#39;s best interest to come</text>
  <text start="880.68" dur="4.32">up with as many problems and as many</text>
  <text start="882.45" dur="5.4">solutions as possible even if it means</text>
  <text start="885" dur="5.49">manufacturing the problem so that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="887.85" dur="4.62">of the issue in history is that people</text>
  <text start="890.49" dur="5.13">try to make up narratives so that they</text>
  <text start="892.47" dur="4.559">can fill the need with something it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.62" dur="3.6">like for example you know we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="897.029" dur="4.68">about this in the past and you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="899.22" dur="4.86">a red-blooded southern boy and so as</text>
  <text start="901.709" dur="4.261">Travis here we&amp;#39;ve talked a little bit</text>
  <text start="904.08" dur="4.8">about the civil war in the past and how</text>
  <text start="905.97" dur="3.78">you know when you actually go back to</text>
  <text start="908.88" dur="4.68">the history</text>
  <text start="909.75" dur="5.67">of the Civil War era you actually had a</text>
  <text start="913.56" dur="4.05">war that was fought over tariffs and</text>
  <text start="915.42" dur="4.23">taxation but about midway through the</text>
  <text start="917.61" dur="4.35">war when the North was losing they</text>
  <text start="919.65" dur="4.52">converted it to a war about slavery so</text>
  <text start="921.96" dur="6">that they would get the humanitarian I</text>
  <text start="924.17" dur="6.15">guess you could say push for victory and</text>
  <text start="927.96" dur="7.14">so now the history of the war is</text>
  <text start="930.32" dur="7.18">remembered as a war of slavery the the</text>
  <text start="935.1" dur="4.35">calls was manufactured in the history as</text>
  <text start="937.5" dur="5.94">a result is manufactured and they filled</text>
  <text start="939.45" dur="4.68">a need by manufacturing that if that</text>
  <text start="943.44" dur="3.99">makes sense</text>
  <text start="944.13" dur="5.37">and now the South will ever be branded</text>
  <text start="947.43" dur="6.03">as a racist because of that propaganda</text>
  <text start="949.5" dur="5.16">that was viewed and as whether it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="953.46" dur="4.34">of hilarious because when you look at</text>
  <text start="954.66" dur="5.46">Trump you know Trump is about is not</text>
  <text start="957.8" dur="7.9">racist as they come</text>
  <text start="960.12" dur="7.77">honestly I mean he&amp;#39;s not not no one ever</text>
  <text start="965.7" dur="4.77">accused Trump of being a racist until if</text>
  <text start="967.89" dur="4.98">you&amp;#39;re definitely and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s funny</text>
  <text start="970.47" dur="5.19">you know because like all of this stuff</text>
  <text start="972.87" dur="3.99">that we have on television now like for</text>
  <text start="975.66" dur="2.61">example one of the shows and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="976.86" dur="3.78">watching right now and if you have not</text>
  <text start="978.27" dur="5.1">watched it it is phenomenal it is</text>
  <text start="980.64" dur="6.06">fantastic it&amp;#39;s on Hulu it&amp;#39;s called The</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="6.39">Handmaid&amp;#39;s Tale it is really really</text>
  <text start="986.7" dur="6.51">really good however that that story</text>
  <text start="989.76" dur="5.25">would not have been written or made if</text>
  <text start="993.21" dur="3.87">it was not for Trump being president</text>
  <text start="995.01" dur="4.62">because it&amp;#39;s all about a patriarchal</text>
  <text start="997.08" dur="5.67">society and all the women are slaves and</text>
  <text start="999.63" dur="6.06">all this kind of stuff and it&amp;#39;s a really</text>
  <text start="1002.75" dur="6.87">interesting story and it&amp;#39;s kind of a de</text>
  <text start="1005.69" dur="6.75">stop ik future and it&amp;#39;s just a really</text>
  <text start="1009.62" dur="4.35">interesting kind of story but a lot of</text>
  <text start="1012.44" dur="4.47">that stuff wouldn&amp;#39;t have existed if</text>
  <text start="1013.97" dur="3.51">Trump was not made president if that</text>
  <text start="1016.91" dur="2.73">makes sense</text>
  <text start="1017.48" dur="5.16">oh yeah well I mean you look at</text>
  <text start="1019.64" dur="6.51">Hollywood and section the parts of</text>
  <text start="1022.64" dur="6.87">society that have political ideologies</text>
  <text start="1026.15" dur="6.09">and Hollywood is big-time liberal</text>
  <text start="1029.51" dur="5.9">ideology right so the movies the TV</text>
  <text start="1032.24" dur="5.07">shows and the speeches at the Grammys</text>
  <text start="1035.41" dur="4.56">everything coming out of Hollywood</text>
  <text start="1037.31" dur="5.499">is painting Trump as a misogynist</text>
  <text start="1039.97" dur="4.969">homophobic Islamophobic</text>
  <text start="1042.809" dur="5.49">you name it every bad word in the book</text>
  <text start="1044.939" dur="6.6">and it&amp;#39;s any art in the theater in movie</text>
  <text start="1048.299" dur="5.431">and which is why on I mean I cut the</text>
  <text start="1051.539" dur="4.86">cable a long time ago I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1053.73" dur="5.069">watch TV or movies and stuff but the</text>
  <text start="1056.399" dur="4.171">little bit that I had seen it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1058.799" dur="5.01">crazy how these narratives are being</text>
  <text start="1060.57" dur="5.91">brought forward to paint Trump&amp;#39;s as</text>
  <text start="1063.809" dur="6.12">being some kind of monsters and speaking</text>
  <text start="1066.48" dur="6.929">of monster we had a massive shooting</text>

  <text start="1281.25" dur="3.69">there are a lot more gun owners now and</text>
  <text start="1283.5" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re a lot more registered concealed</text>

  <text start="1292.86" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s this correlation between more</text>
  <text start="1294.42" dur="3.78">gun owners and more violence it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1296.31" dur="4.2">actually going to out stretches well</text>
  <text start="1298.2" dur="2.49">Obama is the best gun sales person after</text>

  <text start="1300.69" dur="6.84">and I thought my whole because of him to</text>
  <text start="1304.08" dur="6.12">be honest right I&amp;#39;m a bit of an anomaly</text>
  <text start="1307.53" dur="3.99">amongst all the Canadians I know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1310.2" dur="3.93">that there&amp;#39;s usually this kind of</text>
  <text start="1311.52" dur="4.47">sanctimonious like well you know all</text>
  <text start="1314.13" dur="3.39">that gun violence down there in the</text>
  <text start="1315.99" dur="3.9">States because Americans have to have</text>
  <text start="1317.52" dur="4.35">guns and I&amp;#39;ve you know lived with</text>
  <text start="1319.89" dur="4.26">Americans I&amp;#39;ve sides you know seeing</text>
  <text start="1321.87" dur="4.14">things and learned points of view and</text>
  <text start="1324.15" dur="5.34">just even you know more recent years</text>
  <text start="1326.01" dur="8.37">done my research and even yesterday I</text>
  <text start="1329.49" dur="8.19">saw some video explaining things like</text>
  <text start="1334.38" dur="6.93">how many how many Americans per capita</text>
  <text start="1337.68" dur="7.32">own guns and compared with you know how</text>
  <text start="1341.31" dur="6.2">many you know the murder rate in in you</text>
  <text start="1345" dur="6.09">know per capita and that basically</text>
  <text start="1347.51" dur="5.29">places like I think the video I was</text>
  <text start="1351.09" dur="5.13">watching the guy said like Plano Texas</text>
  <text start="1352.8" dur="7.77">is like you know the most gun ownership</text>
  <text start="1356.22" dur="8.61">in the world in that city and the the</text>
  <text start="1360.57" dur="6.72">murder rate is like 0.4 people murdered</text>
  <text start="1364.83" dur="7.65">for every 100,000 or something because</text>
  <text start="1367.29" dur="7.23">okay less than Canada yes and so you</text>
  <text start="1372.48" dur="3.81">know I hear all the time like well the</text>
  <text start="1374.52" dur="3.84">problem is you know you can just get</text>
  <text start="1376.29" dur="3.18">your hands on guns so easily but then</text>
  <text start="1378.36" dur="3.57">when you start looking at like the</text>
  <text start="1379.47" dur="4.2">actual statistics of things like what</text>
  <text start="1381.93" dur="5.52">the murder rate is in some area where</text>
  <text start="1383.67" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s like conceal and carry laws or</text>
  <text start="1387.45" dur="3.15">the you know you know these shootings</text>
  <text start="1389.43" dur="5.34">and things that happen in places that</text>
  <text start="1390.6" dur="6.24">are you know don&amp;#39;t have the you know the</text>
  <text start="1394.77" dur="5.4">look conceal and carry laws and stuff</text>
  <text start="1396.84" dur="8.61">like for me it&amp;#39;s something where I can I</text>
  <text start="1400.17" dur="7.44">can see and appreciate having a way to</text>
  <text start="1405.45" dur="4.35">defend myself if need be like I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1407.61" dur="3.93">own a gun or anything but the</text>
  <text start="1409.8" dur="3.87">convenience store we go to a few blocks</text>
  <text start="1411.54" dur="4.59">from our house you know they get robbed</text>
  <text start="1413.67" dur="5.58">every so often and one time maybe two or</text>
  <text start="1416.13" dur="5.58">three years ago it was a brutal robbery</text>
  <text start="1419.25" dur="4.35">and be the owner was shot and spent</text>
  <text start="1421.71" dur="4.83">weeks in a hospital and stuff and so you</text>
  <text start="1423.6" dur="5.4">better believe he&amp;#39;s got a he&amp;#39;s got a you</text>
  <text start="1426.54" dur="4.89">know like a handgun now and I&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="1429" dur="5.73">at least three occasions since where</text>
  <text start="1431.43" dur="5.91">he&amp;#39;s supported robberies but by clicking</text>
  <text start="1434.73" dur="4.62">his gun and you know having having these</text>
  <text start="1437.34" dur="5.1">guys scram and part of me things like</text>
  <text start="1439.35" dur="4.87">well I&amp;#39;m so glad he he has that you know</text>
  <text start="1442.44" dur="4.3">I mean like my logic doesn&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1444.22" dur="4.319">well if if you know so many people</text>
  <text start="1446.74" dur="3.659">didn&amp;#39;t have guns then we wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1448.539" dur="3.691">this problem like no that&amp;#39;s not how it</text>
  <text start="1450.399" dur="4.801">works you know the fact of the matter is</text>
  <text start="1452.23" dur="5.46">is that people who don&amp;#39;t follow the law</text>
  <text start="1455.2" dur="4.859">are not going to follow the law and get</text>
  <text start="1457.69" dur="4.65">a gun anyway so you can make the laws</text>
  <text start="1460.059" dur="4.681">all you want to about preventing gun</text>
  <text start="1462.34" dur="4.919">violence but all you&amp;#39;re going to do is</text>
  <text start="1464.74" dur="4.62">make it harder for people who are you</text>
  <text start="1467.259" dur="5.37">know responsible gun owners people who</text>
  <text start="1469.36" dur="5.549">want to own one legally to get one</text>
  <text start="1472.629" dur="4.5">harder I mean I live in a pretty gun</text>
  <text start="1474.909" dur="6.6">friendly area and when I bought my</text>
  <text start="1477.129" dur="5.4">pistol a few years ago it honestly I was</text>
  <text start="1481.509" dur="4.321">able to go to the sheriff&amp;#39;s department</text>
  <text start="1482.529" dur="5.52">get my pistol permanent and everything</text>
  <text start="1485.83" dur="5.969">my purchase permit within a few hours</text>
  <text start="1488.049" dur="5.911">and was able to get a gun that night but</text>
  <text start="1491.799" dur="3.451">it&amp;#39;s not as easy as what everyone makes</text>
  <text start="1493.96" dur="2.91">it out to be him you got to go through</text>
  <text start="1495.25" dur="2.85">like background checks and all that kind</text>
  <text start="1496.87" dur="4.769">of stuff and I&amp;#39;m not saying they</text>
  <text start="1498.1" dur="8.01">shouldn&amp;#39;t have that but the fact of the</text>
  <text start="1501.639" dur="7.081">matter is because of these liberal</text>
  <text start="1506.11" dur="5.039">tactics now it would take me about a</text>
  <text start="1508.72" dur="4.949">week and a half to get a pistol and I</text>
  <text start="1511.149" dur="4.38">live in a very gun gun friendly</text>
  <text start="1513.669" dur="3.6">environment so if I wanted to go buy</text>
  <text start="1515.529" dur="3.421">another pistol I have to go to the</text>
  <text start="1517.269" dur="3.24">sheriff&amp;#39;s department I&amp;#39;d fill out the</text>
  <text start="1518.95" dur="3.809">paperwork and I have to wait a week and</text>
  <text start="1520.509" dur="4.26">a half to get approved go pick up my</text>
  <text start="1522.759" dur="4.77">permit then go buy a pistol which is</text>
  <text start="1524.769" dur="5.37">kind of ridiculous I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="1527.529" dur="4.951">you&amp;#39;re talking about mine if guns are</text>
  <text start="1530.139" dur="5.04">illegal nobody could do fricking</text>
  <text start="1532.48" dur="5.939">marijuana is illegal and ain&amp;#39;t nobody</text>
  <text start="1535.179" dur="5.941">get it I mean your logic is just all</text>
  <text start="1538.419" dur="6.901">over the board but no no no I totally</text>
  <text start="1541.12" dur="7.169">echo what you&amp;#39;re saying and it takes you</text>
  <text start="1545.32" dur="5.76">a week to get a pistol er it did for me</text>
  <text start="1548.289" dur="6.09">uh my wife when I live in Arizona and</text>
  <text start="1551.08" dur="5.79">you know there&amp;#39;s all this misinformation</text>
  <text start="1554.379" dur="4.591">about you know gun show loopholes that</text>
  <text start="1556.87" dur="3.57">you can go to a gun show and buy a gun</text>
  <text start="1558.97" dur="5.429">without doing the background check that</text>
  <text start="1560.44" dur="7.17">is absolutely not true my wife we went</text>
  <text start="1564.399" dur="5.311">to a gun show here and she bought a 357</text>
  <text start="1567.61" dur="3.99">and she had to go through the background</text>
  <text start="1569.71" dur="3.75">check and have a concealed permit and</text>
  <text start="1571.6" dur="4.319">then she could not pick it up for five</text>
  <text start="1573.46" dur="4.38">days if people think that you can get</text>
  <text start="1575.919" dur="3.951">guns easily</text>
  <text start="1577.84" dur="5.31">in a state like Arizona where we have</text>
  <text start="1579.87" dur="5.32">concealed carry without a permit it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1583.15" dur="5.46">still you have to go through all the</text>
  <text start="1585.19" dur="5.37">hoops to get a gun to buy one legally</text>
  <text start="1588.61" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s not as easy as people think it is</text>
  <text start="1590.56" dur="4.14">you know North German is about to go to</text>
  <text start="1592.96" dur="3.63">the hole concealed carry without a</text>
  <text start="1594.7" dur="3.15">permit kind of thing which I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="1596.59" dur="4.11">excited about that I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1597.85" dur="4.56">awesome but it will still take a week</text>
  <text start="1600.7" dur="3.99">and a half two weeks to get one just</text>
  <text start="1602.41" dur="3.63">because you have to go through the the</text>
  <text start="1604.69" dur="3">background checks and you have to wait</text>
  <text start="1606.04" dur="3.36">till it gets approved and all that kind</text>
  <text start="1607.69" dur="4.47">of stuff now if I wanted to go buy a</text>
  <text start="1609.4" dur="5.31">rifle I could easily go get a rifle and</text>
  <text start="1612.16" dur="4.17">have one of the few hours not a problem</text>
  <text start="1614.71" dur="4.14">they don&amp;#39;t regulate those like they do</text>
  <text start="1616.33" dur="3.9">pistols but it&amp;#39;s funny because you know</text>
  <text start="1618.85" dur="2.85">all the major shootings that have</text>
  <text start="1620.23" dur="4.53">happened in the last few years are</text>
  <text start="1621.7" dur="4.92">typically done by pistols but yet</text>
  <text start="1624.76" dur="4.98">everybody goes after the scary-looking</text>
  <text start="1626.62" dur="4.23">assault rifle guns even though those</text>
  <text start="1629.74" dur="5.34">aren&amp;#39;t the ones that were actually</text>
  <text start="1630.85" dur="6.12">perpetrators yet you know in that same</text>
  <text start="1635.08" dur="5.4">vein I&amp;#39;ve got to make a little rant</text>
  <text start="1636.97" dur="7.8">right here my state legislators have</text>
  <text start="1640.48" dur="5.7">royally ticked me the crap off the you</text>
  <text start="1644.77" dur="4.53">know you know the Sheriff&amp;#39;s Department</text>
  <text start="1646.18" dur="4.56">they get kickback from from our</text>
  <text start="1649.3" dur="3.15">concealed carry permits it takes about</text>
  <text start="1650.74" dur="4.47">15 minutes you know it&amp;#39;s pretty cheap</text>
  <text start="1652.45" dur="5.82">whatever but we had constitutional carry</text>
  <text start="1655.21" dur="5.67">on the table in the house and these eggs</text>
  <text start="1658.27" dur="4.05">law enforcement officers said no no I</text>
  <text start="1660.88" dur="3.42">ought to make it too dangerous and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1662.32" dur="7.08">like I thought y&amp;#39;all swore to uphold the</text>
  <text start="1664.3" dur="8.91">Constitution er now I mean anyway said</text>
  <text start="1669.4" dur="5.19">take me off yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s um definitely</text>
  <text start="1673.21" dur="4.71">easier than what y&amp;#39;all described in</text>
  <text start="1674.59" dur="6.96">Alabama to get a ticket a pistol it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1677.92" dur="5.61">about five minutes in the store well you</text>
  <text start="1681.55" dur="4.53">know I have a kind of strange view of</text>
  <text start="1683.53" dur="4.35">the whole right to bear arms thing I</text>
  <text start="1686.08" dur="3.96">honestly think you know there are a lot</text>

  <text start="1690.04" dur="3.9">[Music]</text>
  <text start="1691.2" dur="5.89">normal citizens to own but my opinion I</text>
  <text start="1693.94" dur="5.28">think the right to bear arms means that</text>
  <text start="1697.09" dur="3.66">we should be able to have the same arms</text>
  <text start="1699.22" dur="3.39">that our military has you know</text>
  <text start="1700.75" dur="4.02">absolutely yeah I don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="1702.61" dur="3.51">think that we need to have nuclear bombs</text>
  <text start="1704.77" dur="5">or anything like that I think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1706.12" dur="3.65">little crazy but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1710.59" dur="3.73">I&amp;#39;m just like to necessarily think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1713.419" dur="2.941">a great idea</text>
  <text start="1714.32" dur="4.26">you know because of some idiot down the</text>
  <text start="1716.36" dur="4.23">street had one you know because of the</text>
  <text start="1718.58" dur="3.719">the Second Amendment and it actually</text>
  <text start="1720.59" dur="6.709">went off that would kill a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1722.299" dur="8.641">people but I get that point I would say</text>
  <text start="1727.299" dur="7.841">that I still think that it&amp;#39;s I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1730.94" dur="5.91">know why it has to be illegal to to buy</text>
  <text start="1735.14" dur="4.08">fully automatic and things like that</text>
  <text start="1736.85" dur="4.319">because a fully automatic versus a semi</text>
  <text start="1739.22" dur="4.439">automatic is not really that much</text>
  <text start="1741.169" dur="3.811">different to be honest with you and you</text>
  <text start="1743.659" dur="3.421">can still get them as long as you get</text>
  <text start="1744.98" dur="4.829">the class permits the class a permits</text>
  <text start="1747.08" dur="6.3">and all that kind of stuff but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1749.809" dur="5.311">difficult to get those but I just think</text>
  <text start="1753.38" dur="3.509">that as a private citizen we should have</text>
  <text start="1755.12" dur="5.549">the right to get whatever kind of weapon</text>
  <text start="1756.889" dur="5.28">that we want if it&amp;#39;s necessary to</text>
  <text start="1760.669" dur="3.811">protect ourselves because if our</text>
  <text start="1762.169" dur="4.35">government does become a tyranny then</text>
  <text start="1764.48" dur="5.069">we&amp;#39;re going to have to defend ourselves</text>
  <text start="1766.519" dur="4.38">with semi automatics against fully</text>

  <text start="1791.35" dur="5.439">well and you&amp;#39;re right I mean nobody</text>
  <text start="1794.149" dur="5.091">really wants to think of their neighbor</text>

  <text start="1840.57" dur="3.48">could even argue that the government</text>
  <text start="1842.49" dur="6.45">doesn&amp;#39;t actually have a constitutional</text>
  <text start="1844.05" dur="9.71">right to have a an army and an airforce</text>
  <text start="1848.94" dur="8.37">like we have the Constitution sanction a</text>
  <text start="1853.76" dur="6.7">regulated militia really probably state</text>
  <text start="1857.31" dur="5.97">militias made up of average citizen not</text>
  <text start="1860.46" dur="5.31">a professional army the Constitution</text>
  <text start="1863.28" dur="4.25">actually probably would give us more or</text>
  <text start="1865.77" dur="5.28">something like what Switzerland has</text>
  <text start="1867.53" dur="5.86">where the government allows and provides</text>
  <text start="1871.05" dur="6.33">for shooting ranges ammunition and</text>
  <text start="1873.39" dur="6.3">weapon for citizens the citizens are</text>
  <text start="1877.38" dur="5.04">expected to know how to use guns and</text>
  <text start="1879.69" dur="4.47">they don&amp;#39;t have a standing army they</text>
  <text start="1882.42" dur="5.6">rely on their citizens and well armed</text>
  <text start="1884.16" dur="6.54">citizenry we take care of those issues</text>
  <text start="1888.02" dur="4.18">so what we&amp;#39;ve got in the States right</text>
  <text start="1890.7" dur="4.38">now is not really I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="1892.2" dur="5.19">they feathers of the Constitution one I</text>
  <text start="1895.08" dur="4.02">mean now that tracks back to you know</text>
  <text start="1897.39" dur="3.84">and I mentioned it earlier you know</text>
  <text start="1899.1" dur="4.05">because I&amp;#39;m a civil war fanatic but a</text>
  <text start="1901.23" dur="4.17">lot of that tracks back to the Civil War</text>
  <text start="1903.15" dur="4.62">to be honest you know because back then</text>
  <text start="1905.4" dur="4.47">it was a citizen militia there was a</text>
  <text start="1907.77" dur="4.98">standing army but the army was very very</text>
  <text start="1909.87" dur="5.85">small the Civil War battalions and the</text>
  <text start="1912.75" dur="6.18">actual state militias were made up of</text>
  <text start="1915.72" dur="5.07">private citizens that were pulled on and</text>
  <text start="1918.93" dur="5.79">in the time that their country in their</text>
  <text start="1920.79" dur="6.36">state needed them and quite frankly you</text>
  <text start="1924.72" dur="5.31">know back then the army was just a</text>
  <text start="1927.15" dur="4.86">really really really small force you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1930.03" dur="5.37">in the Army was really the best of the</text>
  <text start="1932.01" dur="5.67">best of the best but it wasn&amp;#39;t meant to</text>
  <text start="1935.4" dur="4.56">send people overseas to fight other</text>
  <text start="1937.68" dur="4.44">people&amp;#39;s Wars it was meant to protect</text>
  <text start="1939.96" dur="6.21">our homeland and to protect our states</text>
  <text start="1942.12" dur="7.14">and thus it of the citizens or the I</text>
  <text start="1946.17" dur="4.65">guess you could say the civilians should</text>
  <text start="1949.26" dur="3.96">have a working knowledge of how to</text>
  <text start="1950.82" dur="4.83">actually handle guns and handle all this</text>
  <text start="1953.22" dur="4.44">kind of stuff but all of that goes back</text>
  <text start="1955.65" dur="3.6">to that history a lot of our politics</text>
  <text start="1957.66" dur="4.17">and a lot of our things that have</text>
  <text start="1959.25" dur="5.61">actually taken place over the last 150</text>
  <text start="1961.83" dur="5.43">200 years is a result of Abraham Lincoln</text>
  <text start="1964.86" dur="5.1">and the Civil War you know a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1967.26" dur="3.62">politics that we have today is all based</text>
  <text start="1969.96" dur="2.39">on that</text>
  <text start="1970.88" dur="3.06">now I know what makes me sound kind of</text>
  <text start="1972.35" dur="2.85">crazy but I really believe that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1973.94" dur="4.29">the case and if you look in the history</text>
  <text start="1975.2" dur="5.61">you would see what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1978.23" dur="5.73">Lincoln was kind of a tyrant in a lot of</text>
  <text start="1980.81" dur="5.79">respects he went after the press and he</text>
  <text start="1983.96" dur="4.74">went after a lot of people he was living</text>
  <text start="1986.6" dur="4.32">in a very difficult time and I think the</text>
  <text start="1988.7" dur="5.46">time that we&amp;#39;re living in right now is</text>
  <text start="1990.92" dur="6.06">not all that different from the time</text>
  <text start="1994.16" dur="4.2">that led up to the Civil War I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="1996.98" dur="5.73">it is that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m concerned about</text>
  <text start="1998.36" dur="8.67">I&amp;#39;m very concerned that this movement to</text>
  <text start="2002.71" dur="6.75">try to unseat impeach or kill a duly</text>
  <text start="2007.03" dur="5.13">elected president is going to lead to</text>
  <text start="2009.46" dur="5.97">civil unrest and possibilities of a war</text>
  <text start="2012.16" dur="5.61">if Trump gets assassinated it is going</text>
  <text start="2015.43" dur="5.82">to be a we&amp;#39;re going to be living in a</text>
  <text start="2017.77" dur="5.79">very very ugly time and less that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="2021.25" dur="4.11">biggest concern right now so wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2023.56" dur="3.78">there more legitimate threats against</text>
  <text start="2025.36" dur="6.42">Obama and nothing actually ever came of</text>
  <text start="2027.34" dur="7.08">it like no really no no and the reason I</text>
  <text start="2031.78" dur="6.63">say that is it&amp;#39;s who is doing the</text>
  <text start="2034.42" dur="6.48">talking okay the learning well right</text>
  <text start="2038.41" dur="5.01">exactly what and here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="2040.9" dur="4.68">people have said oh you know people were</text>
  <text start="2043.42" dur="4.86">burning Obama in effigy and they were</text>
  <text start="2045.58" dur="4.17">hanging Obama in effigy and there were</text>
  <text start="2048.28" dur="4.29">all these other things going on during</text>
  <text start="2049.75" dur="4.68">Obama&amp;#39;s time in office that&amp;#39;s all true</text>
  <text start="2052.57" dur="3.48">that all happened I have friends who</text>
  <text start="2054.43" dur="4.74">send the images collections of images</text>
  <text start="2056.05" dur="4.83">that portrayed violence against</text>
  <text start="2059.17" dur="5.04">President Obama that&amp;#39;s all true that</text>
  <text start="2060.88" dur="5.94">happened the difference is the people</text>
  <text start="2064.21" dur="5.91">who were doing that were people who were</text>
  <text start="2066.82" dur="7.32">hiding in the corners of conservativism</text>
  <text start="2070.12" dur="6.36">and libertarians online communities they</text>
  <text start="2074.14" dur="5.25">were not mainstream they were not</text>
  <text start="2076.48" dur="6.45">well-known people and when that stuff</text>
  <text start="2079.39" dur="5.49">was brought to light leaders libertarian</text>
  <text start="2082.93" dur="4.77">and conservative leaders condemned it</text>
  <text start="2084.88" dur="5.37">and said it&amp;#39;s inappropriate that is not</text>
  <text start="2087.7" dur="5.76">us that&amp;#39;s not who we are so there was</text>
  <text start="2090.25" dur="5.82">some anti-obama sentiment during his</text>
  <text start="2093.46" dur="5.88">term no no argument about that</text>
  <text start="2096.07" dur="5.97">but it wasn&amp;#39;t mainstream it was fringe</text>
  <text start="2099.34" dur="6.09">and the problem with the anti-trump</text>
  <text start="2102.04" dur="7.29">rhetoric now is it&amp;#39;s mainstream it is</text>
  <text start="2105.43" dur="6.54">being propagated by CNN New York Times</text>
  <text start="2109.33" dur="4.14">Washington Post it&amp;#39;s been propagated by</text>
  <text start="2111.97" dur="4.56">the news anchors it&amp;#39;s being propagated</text>
  <text start="2113.47" dur="4.86">by Hollywood as you can&amp;#39;t listen to</text>
  <text start="2116.53" dur="3.99">anybody from Hollywood talk about Trump</text>
  <text start="2118.33" dur="4.95">without them hinting is suggesting he</text>
  <text start="2120.52" dur="5.07">needs to be assassinated that he was not</text>
  <text start="2123.28" dur="3.87">legitimately elected that he needs to be</text>
  <text start="2125.59" dur="6.17">overthrown that he needs to be gotten</text>
  <text start="2127.15" dur="7.56">away with and this is mainstream in the</text>
  <text start="2131.76" dur="5.35">liberal it&amp;#39;s not in the corner he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="2134.71" dur="4.95">in the fringes this is in our face</text>
  <text start="2137.11" dur="4.11">because a day on social media well I</text>
  <text start="2139.66" dur="6.24">totally agree with you I mean the whole</text>
  <text start="2141.22" dur="8.55">Caesar play where it depicted a Trump</text>
  <text start="2145.9" dur="5.73">being fabbed stabbed and people were</text>
  <text start="2149.77" dur="4.38">cheering it and getting all excited</text>
  <text start="2151.63" dur="5.22">about it and then you&amp;#39;ve got it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2154.15" dur="5.16">kind of a gripping for the for the last</text>
  <text start="2156.85" dur="6.42">eight years we&amp;#39;ve dealt with the left</text>
  <text start="2159.31" dur="6.3">kind of lecturing the right about being</text>

  <text start="2170.89" dur="5.16">all of this jazz and and now we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="2173.55" dur="5.59">somebody that they did not like get</text>
  <text start="2176.05" dur="4.41">elected and all they do now is they talk</text>
  <text start="2179.14" dur="3.84">about different ways that he could</text>
  <text start="2180.46" dur="7.35">potentially die what would happen if he</text>
  <text start="2182.98" dur="7.26">died if you turn on CNN or MSNBC for any</text>
  <text start="2187.81" dur="5.34">stretch of time they literally devote</text>
  <text start="2190.24" dur="5.94">about you know 80 to 90 percent of the</text>
  <text start="2193.15" dur="5.13">time that they&amp;#39;re televised talking</text>
  <text start="2196.18" dur="4.29">about different things about Trump and</text>
  <text start="2198.28" dur="4.83">how bad he is and all this kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="2200.47" dur="4.29">and in granted like I said I before the</text>
  <text start="2203.11" dur="4.2">whole election thing I was kind of</text>
  <text start="2204.76" dur="4.29">terrified of Trump and I voted for him</text>
  <text start="2207.31" dur="3.78">only because I just wanted to see the</text>
  <text start="2209.05" dur="5.27">destruction of the political parties</text>
  <text start="2211.09" dur="5.97">that we have out and I know that crazy</text>
  <text start="2214.32" dur="4.27">but it&amp;#39;s true I mean I honestly just</text>
  <text start="2217.06" dur="4.29">wanted to see the Republican and the</text>
  <text start="2218.59" dur="4.86">Democrat Party die so that we&amp;#39;d actually</text>
  <text start="2221.35" dur="3.9">have multiple political parties rise in</text>
  <text start="2223.45" dur="3.09">their place and actually go back to the</text>
  <text start="2225.25" dur="3.18">constitutional republic that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2226.54" dur="3.23">supposed to be because that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="2228.43" dur="4.65">we are</text>
  <text start="2229.77" dur="6.94">and that&amp;#39;s ultimately what my objective</text>
  <text start="2233.08" dur="6.3">was but being an outsider watching you</text>
  <text start="2236.71" dur="7.35">know looking at all of this stuff I</text>
  <text start="2239.38" dur="7.83">think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s terrifying to to think</text>
  <text start="2244.06" dur="6.36">that this mainstream kind of cult of</text>
  <text start="2247.21" dur="6.6">personality attacking a sitting</text>

  <text start="2253.81" dur="8.34">can rile and I guess you could say</text>
  <text start="2257.62" dur="7.44">militarize people who are not quite all</text>
  <text start="2262.15" dur="5.31">there to go and attempt to make law make</text>

  <text start="2275.19" dur="5.83">Republicans at a baseball practice I</text>
  <text start="2277.92" dur="5.53">think honestly that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a kind of a</text>
  <text start="2281.02" dur="5.51">dangerous precedent or we&amp;#39;re setting my</text>
  <text start="2283.45" dur="6.83">concern is that the mainstream media is</text>
  <text start="2286.53" dur="5.77">trying to normalize violence against</text>
  <text start="2290.28" dur="4.12">conservatives and that&amp;#39;s a harsh</text>
  <text start="2292.3" dur="3.51">statement but if you look back at what</text>
  <text start="2294.4" dur="3.81">has been going on in the mainstream</text>

  <text start="2304" dur="6.57">it is a slow creeping they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>

  <text start="2580.4" dur="6.51">throws kerosene on the fire but at some</text>
  <text start="2584.33" dur="5.58">point conservatives need to push back</text>

  <text start="2589.91" dur="5.13">too far people have been shot are you</text>
  <text start="2593.66" dur="3.9">are you what are you going to stop how</text>
  <text start="2595.04" dur="5.49">many people are going to die before this</text>
  <text start="2597.56" dur="4.56">anteye conservative movement goes back</text>
  <text start="2600.53" dur="3.21">in the other direction it has to stop</text>
  <text start="2602.12" dur="3.69">and conservatives are not doing anything</text>
  <text start="2603.74" dur="3.6">for the most part they&amp;#39;re sucking it up</text>
  <text start="2605.81" dur="4.59">and they&amp;#39;re taking it they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="2607.34" dur="4.83">pushing back and that frustrates me and</text>
  <text start="2610.4" dur="3.75">I don&amp;#39;t know what the answer is but</text>
  <text start="2612.17" dur="4.53">except last night</text>
  <text start="2614.15" dur="5.19">I kind of came up with an answer what</text>
  <text start="2616.7" dur="4.17">God has been showing me through a lot of</text>
  <text start="2619.34" dur="5.63">the drains I&amp;#39;ve had in the last six</text>
  <text start="2620.87" dur="7.59">months is that as the banner and</text>
  <text start="2624.97" dur="5.56">president Trump correctly said the media</text>
  <text start="2628.46" dur="6.12">is the enemy of the American people and</text>
  <text start="2630.53" dur="7.32">and the reason why they say that is the</text>
  <text start="2634.58" dur="5.19">mainstream media is an outlet that is</text>
  <text start="2637.85" dur="5.01">controlled for political purposes and</text>
  <text start="2639.77" dur="4.59">has an agenda and it is brainwashing the</text>
  <text start="2642.86" dur="3.75">American people as they&amp;#39;re thinking that</text>
  <text start="2644.36" dur="5.79">violence is okay get violence easy</text>
  <text start="2646.61" dur="6.06">solution that hey we&amp;#39;re facing Nazis so</text>
  <text start="2650.15" dur="4.83">violence is a is it normal is it in an</text>
  <text start="2652.67" dur="4.98">acceptable response that&amp;#39;s being pushed</text>
  <text start="2654.98" dur="5.4">by the media the media is brainwashing</text>
  <text start="2657.65" dur="5.96">people so what God has been showing me</text>
  <text start="2660.38" dur="6.21">is he is raising up an alternative media</text>
  <text start="2663.61" dur="5.59">people like you and I who are doing</text>
  <text start="2666.59" dur="5.55">podcasts we&amp;#39;re doing periscope we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2669.2" dur="5.22">doing Facebook live video God is raising</text>
  <text start="2672.14" dur="6.84">up an army of people who are providing</text>
  <text start="2674.42" dur="6.72">an alternate narrative to what MSNBC and</text>

  <text start="2746.38" dur="3.81">the mainstream media narrative people</text>
  <text start="2748.18" dur="3.92">are going to eventually turn off CNN and</text>
  <text start="2750.19" dur="4.29">and even Fox is becoming kind of</text>
  <text start="2752.1" dur="4.57">ridiculous at the way that there is</text>
  <text start="2754.48" dur="3.72">presenting a lot of pressure what the</text>
  <text start="2756.67" dur="3.81">Lord has shown me is that there is this</text>
  <text start="2758.2" dur="4.26">war going on between the mainstream</text>
  <text start="2760.48" dur="4.29">media and the Trump administration I</text>
  <text start="2762.46" dur="2.88">think the president is going to win this</text>
  <text start="2764.77" dur="2.61">war</text>
  <text start="2765.34" dur="4.26">I think the mainstream media is going to</text>
  <text start="2767.38" dur="4.38">look like absolutely fools when this is</text>
  <text start="2769.6" dur="4.05">all over with their credibility is going</text>
  <text start="2771.76" dur="4.65">to be shot if you look at what happens</text>
  <text start="2773.65" dur="4.79">during the coma hearing and all of the</text>
  <text start="2776.41" dur="5.25">mainstream media outlets were all</text>
  <text start="2778.44" dur="6.34">sitting on edge waiting for James Comey</text>
  <text start="2781.66" dur="5.13">to nail trunk to just put the nail in</text>
  <text start="2784.78" dur="5.07">the coffin and all come he did was in</text>
  <text start="2786.79" dur="5.01">Beck himself and it looks kind of a</text>
  <text start="2789.85" dur="3.59">bitter taste in the mouth we find out</text>
  <text start="2791.8" dur="3.84">that Trump wasn&amp;#39;t under investigation</text>
  <text start="2793.44" dur="3.73">even though the mainstream media has</text>
  <text start="2795.64" dur="2.7">been telling everybody for about the</text>
  <text start="2797.17" dur="2.76">last year that Trump is under</text>
  <text start="2798.34" dur="4.4">investigation what we learned that</text>
  <text start="2799.93" dur="5.52">hearing was he never was under this and</text>
  <text start="2802.74" dur="4.42">because the mainstream media has all</text>
  <text start="2805.45" dur="3.36">these false narratives that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2807.16" dur="2.79">pushing the more we have these public</text>
  <text start="2808.81" dur="3.03">hearings the more people are going to</text>
  <text start="2809.95" dur="4.05">realize wow this guy&amp;#39;s been lying to us</text>
  <text start="2811.84" dur="4.38">the whole time if people are willing to</text>
  <text start="2814" dur="4.109">go out there and do podcasts and live</text>
  <text start="2816.22" dur="4.77">streaming videos and tell the truth</text>
  <text start="2818.109" dur="3.821">about what&amp;#39;s happening mr. and mrs. John</text>
  <text start="2820.99" dur="3.43">Q public</text>
  <text start="2821.93" dur="4.77">well tune in and listen to you right</text>
  <text start="2824.42" dur="4.08">well even just this is chimed in in a</text>
  <text start="2826.7" dur="4.59">more esoteric kind of way and not the</text>
  <text start="2828.5" dur="5.13">specifics of what you said my mom was</text>
  <text start="2831.29" dur="4.16">just visiting us and we watched like</text>
  <text start="2833.63" dur="5.31">Netflix every night and there was some</text>
  <text start="2835.45" dur="5.8">Michael Keaton movie about the the</text>
  <text start="2838.94" dur="4.95">priest scandal I forget what that movie</text>
  <text start="2841.25" dur="5.25">was called the Boston Globe or whatever</text>
  <text start="2843.89" dur="5.34">that broke the story about the all these</text>
  <text start="2846.5" dur="4.95">priests in in that area that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2849.23" dur="3.42">abusing children and whatnot and there</text>
  <text start="2851.45" dur="2.91">was a line somewhere towards the</text>
  <text start="2852.65" dur="2.88">beginning of the movie where you know</text>
  <text start="2854.36" dur="3.56">someone was talking to the other and</text>
  <text start="2855.53" dur="6.36">said like there used to be a time where</text>
  <text start="2857.92" dur="7.24">journalism wasn&amp;#39;t profitable it was this</text>
  <text start="2861.89" dur="4.91">honorable thing you know Dec you know</text>
  <text start="2865.16" dur="4.11">decades earlier whatever that people</text>
  <text start="2866.8" dur="4.75">they felt it was their their moral</text>
  <text start="2869.27" dur="5.46">obligation their their you know as an</text>
  <text start="2871.55" dur="7.35">honorable thing to let the public know</text>
  <text start="2874.73" dur="6.96">the truth you know and I remember that</text>
  <text start="2878.9" dur="5.1">line or that dialogue whatever whatever</text>
  <text start="2881.69" dur="4.32">the exact thing was jumping out at me</text>
  <text start="2884" dur="5.82">because you you really couldn&amp;#39;t say that</text>
  <text start="2886.01" dur="7.26">now and if you do then it doesn&amp;#39;t apply</text>
  <text start="2889.82" dur="5.97">to like the news channels on TV and then</text>
  <text start="2893.27" dur="7.23">even big web sites and stuff but a lot</text>
  <text start="2895.79" dur="7.44">more to you know lone Ranger&amp;#39;s or these</text>
  <text start="2900.5" dur="5.37">people who you know they make what</text>
  <text start="2903.23" dur="3.81">videos on the internet they do you know</text>
  <text start="2905.87" dur="5.13">their their blogs and stuff</text>
  <text start="2907.04" dur="5.4">it applies more to that and so I guess</text>
  <text start="2911" dur="5.97">from that I sort of have a question for</text>
  <text start="2912.44" dur="6.87">you David what do you say to someone who</text>
  <text start="2916.97" dur="5.04">says so like well who are you</text>
  <text start="2919.31" dur="5.79">amongst the you know the many faces in</text>
  <text start="2922.01" dur="6.78">the crowd who it just has a as a video</text>
  <text start="2925.1" dur="6.24">as a webcam as a keyboard you know why</text>
  <text start="2928.79" dur="4.56">why I believe what you say is the truth</text>
  <text start="2931.34" dur="4.95">or the research you say you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2933.35" dur="4.5">doing like how do you answer I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="2936.29" dur="3.74">you get questions like that so how do</text>
  <text start="2937.85" dur="5.04">you I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2940.03" dur="6.28">you don&amp;#39;t answer evoke it ask no I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2942.89" dur="5.87">get asked much home um okay I really</text>
  <text start="2946.31" dur="7.41">don&amp;#39;t because when I do my broadcast on</text>
  <text start="2948.76" dur="7.43">periscope I do my broadcast a little bit</text>
  <text start="2953.72" dur="6.22">like the way I write my books</text>
  <text start="2956.19" dur="5.07">I&amp;#39;m taking complex ideas like who are</text>
  <text start="2959.94" dur="3.06">all these people in the Senate Judiciary</text>
  <text start="2961.26" dur="2.79">Committee who are these people on the</text>
  <text start="2963" dur="2.7">Senate Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="2964.05" dur="3.51">and how are they connected to the</text>
  <text start="2965.7" dur="4.02">Department of Justice and the FBI who</text>
  <text start="2967.56" dur="5.519">has oversight and now how do you think</text>
  <text start="2969.72" dur="6.27">all right so a lot of concepts that</text>
  <text start="2973.079" dur="5.311">people are not familiar with what I do</text>
  <text start="2975.99" dur="4.829">is I explain to them who these people</text>
  <text start="2978.39" dur="4.86">are what their relationship is to</text>
  <text start="2980.819" dur="4.53">departments is there an oversight what</text>
  <text start="2983.25" dur="4.38">rules did we followed what could we can</text>
  <text start="2985.349" dur="3.901">expect I give them a little bit of you</text>
  <text start="2987.63" dur="3.75">know if I have had a dream about it I</text>
  <text start="2989.25" dur="6.45">explain what that is show me and dreams</text>
  <text start="2991.38" dur="6.66">and because I&amp;#39;m blaming things to them</text>
  <text start="2995.7" dur="4.5">in layman&amp;#39;s terms and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2998.04" dur="5.91">something they get from CNN if you hear</text>
  <text start="3000.2" dur="5.879">times at MSNBC and a lot of these people</text>
  <text start="3003.95" dur="4.889">have been following me on facebook or on</text>
  <text start="3006.079" dur="4.381">my blog for five or six years I&amp;#39;ve</text>

  <text start="3010.46" dur="5.43">trust with them or for some of them they</text>
  <text start="3014.3" dur="3.569">the trust is already there because</text>
  <text start="3015.89" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;ve read my book so they read my</text>
  <text start="3017.869" dur="5.131">articles or some of them if they&amp;#39;re new</text>
  <text start="3020.869" dur="4.381">and they&amp;#39;re listening to what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="3023" dur="4.38">and they&amp;#39;re like yeah that makes sense I</text>
  <text start="3025.25" dur="3.99">totally get that that that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="3594.15" dur="4.02">because of a post anything serious I get</text>
  <text start="3596.49" dur="6.66">you know all attacked and crass and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3598.17" dur="6.9">lamb Donal is bull yes well one thing</text>
  <text start="3603.15" dur="3.75">you said just a minute ago David was you</text>
  <text start="3605.07" dur="3.72">were talking about how you believe that</text>
  <text start="3606.9" dur="4.17">God wants to use the government to</text>
  <text start="3608.79" dur="4.74">govern kind of from God&amp;#39;s kingdom</text>
  <text start="3611.07" dur="6.75">perspective and and I do believe that</text>
  <text start="3613.53" dur="7.56">there is no one in authority less they</text>
  <text start="3617.82" dur="7.65">are put there by God I don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="3621.09" dur="6.06">think that that God&amp;#39;s kingdom is based</text>
  <text start="3625.47" dur="3.54">on the American government or the</text>
  <text start="3627.15" dur="3.69">American governor&amp;#39;s totally based on</text>
  <text start="3629.01" dur="4.95">that I think honestly I would have a</text>
  <text start="3630.84" dur="6.06">problem with government being based on</text>
  <text start="3633.96" dur="8.46">Christian ideals because man is</text>
  <text start="3636.9" dur="7.53">imperfect and man miss interprets things</text>
  <text start="3642.42" dur="4.98">and it can get out of hand when they</text>
  <text start="3644.43" dur="4.77">interpret things so I do believe that</text>
  <text start="3647.4" dur="3.57">God wants us to be subject to our</text>
  <text start="3649.2" dur="6.33">governmental authorities and and follow</text>
  <text start="3650.97" dur="8.46">the laws according to our conscience so</text>
  <text start="3655.53" dur="5.19">to speak you know obviously we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3659.43" dur="3.39">supposed to do that that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="3660.72" dur="4.77">Bible tells us to but I do have a</text>
  <text start="3662.82" dur="4.86">problem with you know I guess you could</text>
  <text start="3665.49" dur="5.4">say the government being a Christian or</text>
  <text start="3667.68" dur="6.03">a an entity controlled by the church</text>
  <text start="3670.89" dur="5.1">especially with so much in the way of</text>
  <text start="3673.71" dur="3.96">like Freemasonry involved and all of</text>
  <text start="3675.99" dur="3.72">that kind of stuff that&amp;#39;s involved in</text>
  <text start="3677.67" dur="4.23">the upper echelon of our of our</text>
  <text start="3679.71" dur="4.8">government and I get kind of nervous</text>
  <text start="3681.9" dur="5.79">with that kind of stuff yeah and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3684.51" dur="5.28">that&amp;#39;s understandable and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3687.69" dur="3.69">believe that the government United</text>
  <text start="3689.79" dur="4.17">States is supposed to be a Christian</text>
  <text start="3691.38" dur="5.76">institution that we should be enforcing</text>
  <text start="3693.96" dur="5.25">a biblical worldview on the people of</text>
  <text start="3697.14" dur="5.28">our nation but that&amp;#39;s not at all what I</text>
  <text start="3699.21" dur="4.09">would be suggesting I tend to view my</text>
  <text start="3702.42" dur="3.07">face</text>
  <text start="3703.3" dur="5.25">more from a kingdom viewpoint and not a</text>
  <text start="3705.49" dur="5.58">church viewpoint so I don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="3708.55" dur="5.96">the true manifestation of God&amp;#39;s nature</text>
  <text start="3711.07" dur="5.43">and character in will in the earth is</text>
  <text start="3714.51" dur="4.54">necessarily through what at the</text>
  <text start="3716.5" dur="4.52">institution we call the church I believe</text>
  <text start="3719.05" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s supposed to be instituted through</text>
  <text start="3721.02" dur="5.83">patatas which is a completely different</text>
  <text start="3723.28" dur="7.8">concept and you know the Reformers I</text>
  <text start="3726.85" dur="6.42">think and throughout the history we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3731.08" dur="5.1">kind of taken Christianity and made it</text>
  <text start="3733.27" dur="5.22">this institution with denominations I</text>
  <text start="3736.18" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t think that was God&amp;#39;s plan Jesus</text>
  <text start="3738.49" dur="5.07">all throughout the Gospels talked about</text>
  <text start="3740.92" dur="5.13">his kingdom he never really talked about</text>
  <text start="3743.56" dur="7.53">the church that the way we talked about</text>
  <text start="3746.05" dur="9.02">it and I guess what I&amp;#39;m what I would say</text>
  <text start="3751.09" dur="9.21">is that our government if it is why</text>
  <text start="3755.07" dur="9.84">govern justly govern fairly governs with</text>
  <text start="3760.3" dur="9.03">equity toward all without malice without</text>
  <text start="3764.91" dur="7.53">corruption without ill intent toward</text>
  <text start="3769.33" dur="7.16">anyone that it is it&amp;#39;s really just</text>
  <text start="3772.44" dur="7.98">expressing the nature of God which is</text>
  <text start="3776.49" dur="8.32">justice equity fairness benevolence and</text>
  <text start="3780.42" dur="7.27">if our leaders would govern with</text>
  <text start="3784.81" dur="5.46">benevolence and fairness and justice and</text>
  <text start="3787.69" dur="5.25">goodwill toward the people that their</text>
  <text start="3790.27" dur="4.86">governing things would go very well that</text>
  <text start="3792.94" dur="4.8">those are the precepts that our judges</text>
  <text start="3795.13" dur="4.439">and as senators and congressmen had in</text>
  <text start="3797.74" dur="3.65">their heart now</text>
  <text start="3799.569" dur="5.101">together so whether you were Muslim or</text>
  <text start="3801.39" dur="5.53">Christian or atheist you would trust</text>
  <text start="3804.67" dur="4.169">your government because they would be</text>
  <text start="3806.92" dur="3.48">governing with fairness and equity and</text>
  <text start="3808.839" dur="3.75">justice toward you you wouldn&amp;#39;t care if</text>
  <text start="3810.4" dur="5.129">they you know we&amp;#39;re Christian that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3812.589" dur="5.67">that&amp;#39;s what I see the ideal government</text>
  <text start="3815.529" dur="4.58">is being is one that is benevolent and</text>
  <text start="3818.259" dur="4.44">good and not evil and corrupt and</text>
  <text start="3820.109" dur="2.86">self-serving well I totally agree with</text>
  <text start="3822.699" dur="2.88">that</text>
  <text start="3822.969" dur="4.5">David ayah I just misunderstood what you</text>
  <text start="3825.579" dur="5.4">were saying I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think</text>
  <text start="3827.469" dur="7.05">that it should be a whether they call it</text>
  <text start="3830.979" dur="6.3">a PD honesty not a fee a koala theocracy</text>
  <text start="3834.519" dur="5.46">is where God is sort of the govern is</text>
  <text start="3837.279" dur="4.08">the king like Israel was back in the</text>
  <text start="3839.979" dur="3">days of Moses they were supposed to be</text>
  <text start="3841.359" dur="3.75">at the opposite they were led by God</text>
  <text start="3842.979" dur="5.13">yeah I don&amp;#39;t necessarily agree with us</text>
  <text start="3845.109" dur="6.15">needing to be a theocracy I just in my</text>
  <text start="3848.109" dur="5.37">opinion I think it is just like what you</text>
  <text start="3851.259" dur="5.131">said that the government governs fair</text>
  <text start="3853.479" dur="6.03">and equitably across the board and that</text>
  <text start="3856.39" dur="6.419">they don&amp;#39;t play favorites with one over</text>
  <text start="3859.509" dur="5.641">another and that everyone has equal</text>
  <text start="3862.809" dur="5.72">justice under the law whether you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3865.15" dur="8.159">white black purple green yellow whatever</text>
  <text start="3868.529" dur="7.121">and that you are you get the same</text>
  <text start="3873.309" dur="4.29">recognition under that law as what</text>
  <text start="3875.65" dur="4.549">everybody else would get even if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3877.599" dur="4.98">Christian Muslim or whatever I&amp;#39;ve said</text>
  <text start="3880.199" dur="5.8">this time and time again on the podcast</text>
  <text start="3882.579" dur="5.04">that I think you know like for example</text>
  <text start="3885.999" dur="3.96">government should not be involved in</text>
  <text start="3887.619" dur="4.86">marriage which that&amp;#39;s a whole can of</text>
  <text start="3889.959" dur="3.81">worms right there I don&amp;#39;t believe they</text>
  <text start="3892.479" dur="2.911">should be involved in marriage I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3893.769" dur="3.72">believe that they should be involved and</text>
  <text start="3895.39" dur="4.079">a lot of things that they stick their</text>
  <text start="3897.489" dur="3.661">hands in and as a result of them</text>
  <text start="3899.469" dur="4.89">sticking their hands in it it&amp;#39;s caused</text>
  <text start="3901.15" dur="4.53">them to play favorites which going back</text>
  <text start="3904.359" dur="4.89">to a topic we talked about earlier</text>
  <text start="3905.68" dur="5.399">climate change they&amp;#39;ve picked favorites</text>
  <text start="3909.249" dur="4.05">because that&amp;#39;s their favorite narrative</text>
  <text start="3911.079" dur="4.49">and that&amp;#39;s the problem that I have I</text>
  <text start="3913.299" dur="7.41">guess you could say with the government</text>
  <text start="3915.569" dur="6.311">amen yeah well I mean and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="3920.709" dur="3.63">everybody wants out of a government</text>
  <text start="3921.88" dur="4.649">right and really unless you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="3924.339" dur="4.351">jihadist in which case you probably want</text>
  <text start="3926.529" dur="5.611">the government to be something like what</text>
  <text start="3928.69" dur="6.629">they have in in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="3932.14" dur="5.969">those people aside most people want a</text>
  <text start="3935.319" dur="4.831">government that is fair and equitable</text>
  <text start="3938.109" dur="3.63">treats everyone you know with equal</text>
  <text start="3940.15" dur="5.609">dignity and respect under the law there</text>
  <text start="3941.739" dur="5.671">that no one is favored and that the</text>
  <text start="3945.759" dur="4.411">government isn&amp;#39;t corrupt that it does</text>
  <text start="3947.41" dur="7.49">the right thing I think that&amp;#39;s what most</text>
  <text start="3950.17" dur="4.73">people want except for communists oh</text>
  <text start="3956.94" dur="5.289">there&amp;#39;s not really a place in civilized</text>
  <text start="3959.38" dur="4.349">society for them and speaking the whole</text>
  <text start="3962.229" dur="3.33">antifa thing that you were mentioning</text>
  <text start="3963.729" dur="3.901">earlier there Travis I decided to</text>
  <text start="3965.559" dur="3.72">actually do a Google search for antifa</text>
  <text start="3967.63" dur="4.709">because I wasn&amp;#39;t quite sure exactly what</text>
  <text start="3969.279" dur="4.59">it was I&amp;#39;ve heard it but I didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="3972.339" dur="3.801">actually do a lot of research on it and</text>
  <text start="3973.869" dur="5.4">the imagery that&amp;#39;s around that</text>
  <text start="3976.14" dur="6.309">organization is pretty crazy there</text>
  <text start="3979.269" dur="5.371">commies well there there&amp;#39;s no qualms</text>
  <text start="3982.449" dur="5.451">about it you know what the real funny</text>
  <text start="3984.64" dur="7.469">thing is about anything feh so there</text>
  <text start="3987.9" dur="7.119">they take their name from anti fascist</text>
  <text start="3992.109" dur="5.88">right so they claim to be against</text>
  <text start="3995.019" dur="5.22">fascism and then you look at what you</text>
  <text start="3997.989" dur="4.38">look at what they&amp;#39;re doing we look at</text>
  <text start="4000.239" dur="7.83">their behavior you look at how they show</text>
  <text start="4002.369" dur="8.58">up and they create violent protests</text>
  <text start="4008.069" dur="6.42">where really what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="4010.949" dur="6.36">now in this last six months they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4014.489" dur="5.61">trying to shut down people like Milo you</text>
  <text start="4017.309" dur="4.621">know Phyllis and Ann Coulter coup and</text>

  <text start="4021.93" dur="4.679">she&amp;#39;s not even a conservative and you</text>
  <text start="4024.719" dur="3.99">can tell that by the way end culture</text>
  <text start="4026.609" dur="4.89">gets hot and cold on Trump</text>
  <text start="4028.709" dur="4.89">whenever Trump is embracing something</text>
  <text start="4031.499" dur="4.29">that is a distinctly libertarian</text>
  <text start="4033.599" dur="4.321">viewpoint and culprit is totally behind</text>
  <text start="4035.789" dur="3.871">president when he is doing something</text>
  <text start="4037.92" dur="2.49">that is not in the interest of most</text>

  <text start="4046.229" dur="5.04">mainly concerned with is shutting down</text>
  <text start="4048.869" dur="6.391">these speakers who want to go to places</text>

  <text start="4101.43" dur="4.59">what are you doing well there I think</text>
  <text start="4103.65" dur="5.399">just like deal with the Bolsheviks over</text>
  <text start="4106.02" dur="6.029">and over know Russia went over to the</text>

  <text start="4116.27" dur="4.96">right out of the Communist playbook</text>
  <text start="4118.95" dur="5.519">which is exactly why they do not belong</text>
  <text start="4121.23" dur="5.91">in a civilized society so I agree with</text>
  <text start="4124.469" dur="5.941">you want to be here fascism doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4127.14" dur="5.929">involve doesn&amp;#39;t belong in a civilized</text>

  <text start="4133.069" dur="6.701">unfortunately both sides of the coin are</text>
  <text start="4136.2" dur="5.67">equally bad I don&amp;#39;t know why they put</text>
  <text start="4139.77" dur="5.37">fascism on the far right it&amp;#39;s more of an</text>
  <text start="4141.87" dur="6.27">authoritarian kind of thing well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4145.14" dur="4.889">for fascism the authoritarian is all if</text>
  <text start="4148.14" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;ve seen the other political spectrum</text>

  <text start="4176.77" dur="4.83">isn&amp;#39;t that bad of a concept because it</text>

  <text start="4220.78" dur="5.88">because of the way we&amp;#39;re acting to sense</text>
  <text start="4223.78" dur="7.17">it is interesting I watched the video of</text>

  <text start="4230.95" dur="6.87">of homosexuality and his concern is that</text>
  <text start="4234.76" dur="5.46">as you normalized homosexuality you run</text>
  <text start="4237.82" dur="5.94">the risk of coming to a zero population</text>

  <text start="4284.26" dur="6.84">lie he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s pretty dank right now</text>
  <text start="4286.81" dur="6.75">I mean he&amp;#39;s definitely a lot better than</text>
  <text start="4291.1" dur="4.86">the last leader that we had you know</text>
  <text start="4293.56" dur="4.94">well and and you know he&amp;#39;s done some</text>
  <text start="4295.96" dur="5.4">crazy things and he is extremely creepy</text>
  <text start="4298.5" dur="5.32">you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of creepiness</text>
  <text start="4301.36" dur="5.82">around him any time I see him on TV like</text>
  <text start="4303.82" dur="6.71">I&amp;#39;d literally see like my creep meter</text>
  <text start="4307.18" dur="5.51">goes up pretty high but with his attacks</text>
  <text start="4310.53" dur="6.18">Isis and things like that you know I I</text>
  <text start="4312.69" dur="6.12">actually even though I&amp;#39;m anti-war I</text>
  <text start="4316.71" dur="4.98">would love to destroy the the</text>
  <text start="4318.81" dur="5.91">cockroaches that is out there like</text>
  <text start="4321.69" dur="5.13">causing terror in the world but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4324.72" dur="3.69">necessarily want more war I wish there</text>
  <text start="4326.82" dur="2.91">was a better way to actually handle that</text>
  <text start="4328.41" dur="3.09">kind of thing which brings me to the</text>
  <text start="4329.73" dur="6.42">next topic and then we&amp;#39;re going to wrap</text>
  <text start="4331.5" dur="8.61">up apparently how Baghdad II was killed</text>
  <text start="4336.15" dur="7.38">yesterday in an airstrike presumed to be</text>
  <text start="4340.11" dur="5.09">killed of course we all know that what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4343.53" dur="3.81">ultimately going to happen is that</text>
  <text start="4345.2" dur="4.33">somebody&amp;#39;s going to rise up to power</text>
  <text start="4347.34" dur="5.85">that&amp;#39;s probably going to be even worse</text>
  <text start="4349.53" dur="6.96">than now Baghdad II but the fact is is</text>
  <text start="4353.19" dur="5.58">that a US military strike was actually</text>
  <text start="4356.49" dur="6.45">responsible for taking the guy out what</text>
  <text start="4358.77" dur="5.85">were your thoughts on that um good I</text>
  <text start="4362.94" dur="3.87">mean granted I don&amp;#39;t want to be involved</text>
  <text start="4364.62" dur="4.17">over there anyways but here&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="4366.81" dur="4.38">question why are we going to fund Isis</text>
  <text start="4368.79" dur="3.57">and then kill Isis shouldn&amp;#39;t we just not</text>
  <text start="4371.19" dur="6">fund them then we want to kill them</text>
  <text start="4372.36" dur="7.14">later I think that&amp;#39;s the plan I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4377.19" dur="4.68">believe we&amp;#39;re funding Isis right now we</text>
  <text start="4379.5" dur="4.89">were I mean virtually yes we definitely</text>
  <text start="4381.87" dur="4.56">were on it every time like if you look</text>
  <text start="4384.39" dur="7.5">at all these all these things that we</text>
  <text start="4386.43" dur="7.68">funded al Qaeda Isis Hamas it&amp;#39;s all came</text>
  <text start="4391.89" dur="5.37">back to bite us in the rear end well if</text>
  <text start="4394.11" dur="5.07">we not our funding we are funding Isis</text>
  <text start="4397.26" dur="3.78">because we&amp;#39;re giving we&amp;#39;re selling a</text>
  <text start="4399.18" dur="4.02">bunch of weapons to Saudi Arabia and</text>
  <text start="4401.04" dur="5.43">they&amp;#39;re a big ally so to speak but</text>
  <text start="4403.2" dur="5.88">they&amp;#39;re also a big funder of terrorism</text>
  <text start="4406.47" dur="6.45">in the Middle East we&amp;#39;ve also given</text>
  <text start="4409.08" dur="6.41">money to I think it what is our Qatar</text>
  <text start="4412.92" dur="5.28">yeah and they are a big financier of</text>
  <text start="4415.49" dur="4.33">terrorism and all of that stuff is</text>
  <text start="4418.2" dur="4.35">getting back into the hands of these</text>
  <text start="4419.82" dur="5.46">morons that are actually attacking our</text>
  <text start="4422.55" dur="6.54">people and spreading out and murdering</text>
  <text start="4425.28" dur="6.3">Christians and and you know peaceful</text>
  <text start="4429.09" dur="6.2">Muslims and and people in general just</text>
  <text start="4431.58" dur="6.33">for not agreeing with their crazy</text>
  <text start="4435.29" dur="5.2">ideology but the fact of the matter is</text>
  <text start="4437.91" dur="5.22">is we are financing them and we need to</text>
  <text start="4440.49" dur="3.51">stop it and Trump is actually continuing</text>
  <text start="4443.13" dur="3.6">in that same</text>
  <text start="4444" dur="4.41">pattern by giving more weapons to the</text>
  <text start="4446.73" dur="4.29">Middle East when we should be stopping</text>
  <text start="4448.41" dur="5.43">that all together I mean here you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4451.02" dur="6.35">right we had been funding terrorism for</text>
  <text start="4453.84" dur="8.19">a long time so when you go back to oh</text>
  <text start="4457.37" dur="6.25">gosh Bush 41 and then you could argue</text>
  <text start="4462.03" dur="4.29">during the Reagan administration</text>
  <text start="4463.62" dur="5.64">okay the Beach State took over and as</text>
  <text start="4466.32" dur="8.16">West&amp;#39;s General Wesley Clark pointed out</text>
  <text start="4469.26" dur="7.23">during the early 90s the beach state put</text>
  <text start="4474.48" dur="5.67">in place a policy coupe of foreign</text>
  <text start="4476.49" dur="6.27">policy to where the Defense Department</text>
  <text start="4480.15" dur="4.53">and the State Department and the</text>
  <text start="4482.76" dur="4.76">intelligence community essentially</text>
  <text start="4484.68" dur="6.75">co-opted the federal government and</text>
  <text start="4487.52" dur="7.39">decided that our foreign policy was</text>
  <text start="4491.43" dur="5.91">going to be reading change in Africa in</text>
  <text start="4494.91" dur="4.53">the Middle East and they outlined they</text>
  <text start="4497.34" dur="3.42">identified seven countries that they</text>
  <text start="4499.44" dur="4.71">were going to take over in five years</text>
  <text start="4500.76" dur="5.4">and so we went over and for the next I</text>
  <text start="4504.15" dur="7.2">don&amp;#39;t know ever since the early 90s you</text>
  <text start="4506.16" dur="8.73">know 25 years or so we have been in the</text>
  <text start="4511.35" dur="6.54">Middle East in Libya in Syria in North</text>
  <text start="4514.89" dur="8.57">Africa and the Middle East we our policy</text>
  <text start="4517.89" dur="8.24">has been to topple dictators</text>
  <text start="4523.46" dur="4.89">and it was all based on Russia okay it</text>
  <text start="4526.13" dur="7.56">was it was after the fall of the Berlin</text>
  <text start="4528.35" dur="8.67">Wall and for what 30 40 years foreign</text>
  <text start="4533.69" dur="6.69">policy all of our foreign policy was</text>
  <text start="4537.02" dur="6.54">focused on taking down the Soviet Union</text>
  <text start="4540.38" dur="5.31">and after the fall of the Berlin Wall</text>
  <text start="4543.56" dur="3.69">and Soviet Union was dismantled the</text>
  <text start="4545.69" dur="3.72">State Department and they ended the</text>
  <text start="4547.25" dur="4.2">festival we didn&amp;#39;t know what to do they</text>
  <text start="4549.41" dur="4.26">didn&amp;#39;t know what our foreign policy has</text>
  <text start="4551.45" dur="6.66">been foreign policy we didn&amp;#39;t have one</text>
  <text start="4553.67" dur="7.11">so what they decided in the in the</text>
  <text start="4558.11" dur="5.04">defence the State Department decided we</text>
  <text start="4560.78" dur="3.84">are going to make sure that those</text>
  <text start="4563.15" dur="4.44">nations in the Middle East and North</text>
  <text start="4564.62" dur="5.91">Africa that has any possibility of being</text>
  <text start="4567.59" dur="5.25">having any allegiance to the former</text>
  <text start="4570.53" dur="4.65">Soviet Union mostly Russia they were</text>
  <text start="4572.84" dur="4.8">going to make sure that that didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4575.18" dur="6.09">happen and they were going to topple</text>
  <text start="4577.64" dur="6.09">every King and leader and dictator that</text>
  <text start="4581.27" dur="5.16">had any allegiance to Russia and put in</text>
  <text start="4583.73" dur="5.75">puppet so who would build an allegiance</text>
  <text start="4586.43" dur="6.15">to United States our interest so that is</text>
  <text start="4589.48" dur="5.17">the foreign policy that has been going</text>
  <text start="4592.58" dur="5.159">on in Middle East and Africa for the</text>
  <text start="4594.65" dur="5.97">last 25 years well as a result of that</text>
  <text start="4597.739" dur="6.081">we&amp;#39;ve put in office Gaddafi who was a</text>
  <text start="4600.62" dur="6.54">dictator right put him in office we put</text>
  <text start="4603.82" dur="10.51">what&amp;#39;s-his-face Bashir in office in</text>
  <text start="4607.16" dur="10.11">Syria we put Saddam Hussein in Iraq we</text>
  <text start="4614.33" dur="5.61">elevated basically even though we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4617.27" dur="5.33">have direct influence on it it was our</text>
  <text start="4619.94" dur="5.79">fault and as to why Iran became</text>
  <text start="4622.6" dur="5.02">radicalized we created all the problems</text>
  <text start="4625.73" dur="3.989">in the Middle East we created it and</text>
  <text start="4627.62" dur="5.01">we&amp;#39;re continuing to create more and more</text>
  <text start="4629.719" dur="4.231">problems I always I disagree with the</text>
  <text start="4632.63" dur="3.15">fact that we&amp;#39;re creating more problems I</text>
  <text start="4633.95" dur="5.789">don&amp;#39;t think they are and here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4635.78" dur="5.7">where I take exception to the narrative</text>
  <text start="4639.739" dur="5.581">that Trump is just following the deep</text>
  <text start="4641.48" dur="5.61">state policy the the toppling dictators</text>
  <text start="4645.32" dur="4.32">think that that is not at all what Trump</text>
  <text start="4647.09" dur="4.43">is trying to accomplish if you have to</text>
  <text start="4649.64" dur="4.51">listen to what he&amp;#39;s been talking about</text>
  <text start="4651.52" dur="6.53">when he</text>
  <text start="4654.15" dur="6.089">was campaigning he campaigned on we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4658.05" dur="3.689">going to bomb the hell out of Isis we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4660.239" dur="3.351">going to take out Isis we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="4661.739" dur="3">get rid of Isis and we&amp;#39;re going to end</text>
  <text start="4663.59" dur="4.45">terrible</text>
  <text start="4664.739" dur="6.241">okay so that and you have to remember</text>
  <text start="4668.04" dur="4.74">Trump is not a politician he wasn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="4670.98" dur="3.989">saying this to get elected Trump has</text>
  <text start="4672.78" dur="3.209">done everything so far that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4674.969" dur="2.671">promised to do</text>
  <text start="4675.989" dur="3.121">he&amp;#39;s a getting he&amp;#39;s been following</text>
  <text start="4677.64" dur="5.039">through on every one of his campaign</text>
  <text start="4679.11" dur="6.02">promises one of his big ones was bomb</text>
  <text start="4682.679" dur="5.73">the hell out of Isis get rid of Isis</text>
  <text start="4685.13" dur="5.22">cooperate with any nation that is</text>
  <text start="4688.409" dur="7.371">interested in helping us get rid of Isis</text>
  <text start="4690.35" dur="9.34">okay which means that Trump is trying to</text>
  <text start="4695.78" dur="7.439">make a coalition of nations that has the</text>
  <text start="4699.69" dur="7.35">sole focus of getting rid of Isis and</text>
  <text start="4703.219" dur="6.851">Hezbollah and Hamas and any other</text>
  <text start="4707.04" dur="5.94">Islamic terrorist that is out to kill</text>
  <text start="4710.07" dur="6.24">people and when he went over to the</text>
  <text start="4712.98" dur="6.14">Saudi Arabia and did his talks and he</text>
  <text start="4716.31" dur="6.119">talks to the nations of 50 different</text>
  <text start="4719.12" dur="7.15">Arab nations he told them to their face</text>
  <text start="4722.429" dur="6.241">look this violence has to end this</text>
  <text start="4726.27" dur="5.159">terrorism has to end it is not</text>
  <text start="4728.67" dur="5.19">acceptable it cannot continue and we</text>

  <text start="4742.62" dur="6.539">going to have to put an end to it and</text>
  <text start="4745.88" dur="6.73">what happened a week after Trump went to</text>
  <text start="4749.159" dur="7.221">Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia immediately</text>
  <text start="4752.61" dur="7.92">labeled Muslim Brotherhood al-nusrah and</text>
  <text start="4756.38" dur="6.79">an Isis in as terrorist organization</text>
  <text start="4760.53" dur="4.14">they told all of their Saudi nationals</text>
  <text start="4763.17" dur="4.08">if you&amp;#39;re fighting with any of these</text>
  <text start="4764.67" dur="4.11">organizations you have 15 days to come</text>
  <text start="4767.25" dur="2.239">back into the country and were closing</text>
  <text start="4768.78" dur="4.05">our borders</text>
  <text start="4769.489" dur="6.46">next thing that Saudi Arabia did was</text>
  <text start="4772.83" dur="4.47">they cut off diplomatic relations with</text>
  <text start="4775.949" dur="4.741">Qatar</text>
  <text start="4777.3" dur="5.549">because Qatar is heavily involved in</text>
  <text start="4780.69" dur="6">funding terrorism now I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="4782.849" dur="6.691">say I that Saudi Arabia has in funded</text>
  <text start="4786.69" dur="4.969">terrorism they have they definitely have</text>
  <text start="4789.54" dur="5.48">they had been spending a lot of money</text>
  <text start="4791.659" dur="6.071">funding terrorist organization but</text>
  <text start="4795.02" dur="6.34">within the last month that has changed</text>
  <text start="4797.73" dur="6.36">and studies have taken a complete 180</text>
  <text start="4801.36" dur="5.069">position from how they used to look at</text>
  <text start="4804.09" dur="4.89">terrorism because look this is what</text>
  <text start="4806.429" dur="4.5">Trump told them he said what is going to</text>
  <text start="4808.98" dur="4.17">happen if you continue supporting Isis</text>
  <text start="4810.929" dur="5.101">and and all these other terrorist</text>
  <text start="4813.15" dur="4.739">organizations after they kill the people</text>

  <text start="4951.01" dur="4.709">probably what&amp;#39;s going to happen but the</text>
  <text start="4953.26" dur="4.199">issue with the Qataris Qatar is still</text>
  <text start="4955.719" dur="4.081">the largest exporter of natural gas in</text>
  <text start="4957.459" dur="5.071">the world and they had this huge gas</text>
  <text start="4959.8" dur="6.869">field and half of it is owned by Iran</text>
  <text start="4962.53" dur="6.149">and Iran and Qatar have a lot of</text>
  <text start="4966.669" dur="6.05">diplomatic relations and political</text>
  <text start="4968.679" dur="6.99">relations and and Qatar if they break</text>
  <text start="4972.719" dur="6.581">relations with Iran and side with Saudi</text>
  <text start="4975.669" dur="5.97">Arabia their risk of suffering some</text>
  <text start="4979.3" dur="4.619">negative consequences from Iran so Qatar</text>
  <text start="4981.639" dur="5.04">is in a very difficult spot they have</text>
  <text start="4983.919" dur="4.02">reasons to be friendly with Iran and</text>
  <text start="4986.679" dur="3.15">they have other reasons to be friendly</text>
  <text start="4987.939" dur="3.99">with Saudi Arabia and so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="4989.829" dur="5.64">there&amp;#39;s this tug of war going on right</text>
  <text start="4991.929" dur="6.84">now over what can happen with guitar but</text>
  <text start="4995.469" dur="5.61">but I think I think what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="4998.769" dur="4.14">happen is Trump is going to put enough</text>
  <text start="5001.079" dur="4.65">pressure on those Middle Eastern nations</text>
  <text start="5002.909" dur="6.93">to stop funding terrorist organizations</text>
  <text start="5005.729" dur="6.581">to help get rid of them and eventually</text>
  <text start="5009.839" dur="4.781">what I would like to see happen is you</text>
  <text start="5012.31" dur="4.68">have something like NATO but in the</text>
  <text start="5014.62" dur="4.79">Middle East they all contribute to a</text>
  <text start="5016.99" dur="5.01">mutual defense fund that will help</text>
  <text start="5019.41" dur="5.05">stabilize the Middle East and here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="5022" dur="5.78">interesting thing with Israel Israel is</text>
  <text start="5024.46" dur="7.02">now exciting with Saudi Arabia because</text>
  <text start="5027.78" dur="4.69">Saudi is taking a strong anti Iranian</text>
  <text start="5031.48" dur="5.18">view</text>
  <text start="5032.47" dur="7.43">so if Israel cooperates with Saudi and</text>
  <text start="5036.66" dur="8.05">Qatar and United Arab Emirates and Egypt</text>
  <text start="5039.9" dur="7.54">against Iran that could create a very</text>
  <text start="5044.71" dur="4.89">strong military political influence that</text>
  <text start="5047.44" dur="4.68">would weaken Iran and cripple them and</text>
  <text start="5049.6" dur="5.13">Trump just a couple days ago is now</text>
  <text start="5052.12" dur="4.71">putting more sanctions on Iran you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5054.73" dur="4.29">going to see Iran weaken and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5056.83" dur="4.74">going to see Saudi Arabia become</text>
  <text start="5059.02" dur="4.67">stronger but in order for and/or if</text>
  <text start="5061.57" dur="4.2">Saudi is going to become stronger</text>
  <text start="5063.69" dur="4.42">they&amp;#39;re going to have to play along with</text>
  <text start="5065.77" dur="6.63">Trump and Trump is going to force them</text>
  <text start="5068.11" dur="6.39">to stop on intelligence and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="5072.4" dur="3.63">I see going on yes they have been</text>
  <text start="5074.5" dur="4.32">funding terrorism for a long time I</text>
  <text start="5076.03" dur="4.95">think they&amp;#39;re going to see that end so</text>
  <text start="5078.82" dur="2.88">here&amp;#39;s my question if we&amp;#39;re fighting</text>
  <text start="5080.98" dur="2.46">terrorists</text>
  <text start="5081.7" dur="4.56">the reason that we have terrorists that</text>
  <text start="5083.44" dur="5.97">hate the United States is because we</text>
  <text start="5086.26" dur="5.15">kill people and obviously if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5089.41" dur="3.9">trying to kill terrorists but</text>
  <text start="5091.41" dur="7.18">essentially one&amp;#39;s home out here is</text>
  <text start="5093.31" dur="9.06">blowback um Ron Paul says Ron Paul you</text>
  <text start="5098.59" dur="7.62">know he oh he brought this up in a lot</text>
  <text start="5102.37" dur="6.36">of a lot of the Congress hearings aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5106.21" dur="4.44">we afraid of blowback creating more</text>
  <text start="5108.73" dur="5.55">tears by bombing more people I mean</text>
  <text start="5110.65" dur="4.77">wouldn&amp;#39;t if we we as United States left</text>
  <text start="5114.28" dur="4.02">the crap alone</text>
  <text start="5115.42" dur="4.86">and let the people over there sort it</text>
  <text start="5118.3" dur="7.08">out wouldn&amp;#39;t that be a better a better</text>
  <text start="5120.28" dur="8.16">solution well and this is where you have</text>
  <text start="5125.38" dur="5.52">some significant ideological differences</text>
  <text start="5128.44" dur="5.51">between Rand Paul and Ron Paul the</text>
  <text start="5130.9" dur="5.73">classic libertarian viewpoint of</text>
  <text start="5133.95" dur="4.57">non-expansion non-military involvement</text>
  <text start="5136.63" dur="4.74">we just need to take care of our own</text>
  <text start="5138.52" dur="4.56">stuff and let other nations fight their</text>
  <text start="5141.37" dur="2.91">own Wars and we need to remain detached</text>
  <text start="5143.08" dur="2.94">for that</text>
  <text start="5144.28" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s one perspective next one that</text>
  <text start="5146.02" dur="5.01">tells a lot of libertarians and when</text>
  <text start="5148.09" dur="5.46">they see the president finding weapons</text>
  <text start="5151.03" dur="3.99">deals with Middle Eastern nations they</text>
  <text start="5153.55" dur="3.18">get freaked out about that because they</text>
  <text start="5155.02" dur="3.27">just think oh well you know here we are</text>
  <text start="5156.73" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;re going to be keeping ourselves</text>
  <text start="5158.29" dur="3.9">involved in Middle Eastern wars that we</text>
  <text start="5160.06" dur="4.83">have no business being it explained to</text>
  <text start="5162.19" dur="5.46">me why we signed a deal with Qatar if</text>
  <text start="5164.89" dur="5.37">guitar is also a financier of terror</text>
  <text start="5167.65" dur="4.23">that one I do not understand that came</text>
  <text start="5170.26" dur="4.71">out of Lucky Ilan we just signed a</text>
  <text start="5171.88" dur="7.08">fifteen billion dollars agreement or it</text>
  <text start="5174.97" dur="6.42">was desired to buy FFP and and the thing</text>
  <text start="5178.96" dur="6.41">is I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know if Trump</text>
  <text start="5181.39" dur="8.91">has gotten the commitments in Qatar to</text>
  <text start="5185.37" dur="6.49">stop funding Isis and al-nusra I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5190.3" dur="5.07">know what that&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="5191.86" dur="5.94">I haven&amp;#39;t really looked into that that</text>
  <text start="5195.37" dur="3.93">it that one that one I can&amp;#39;t explain yet</text>
  <text start="5197.8" dur="3.69">I have to do some more research on it</text>
  <text start="5199.3" dur="3.84">you had a question that you wanted to</text>
  <text start="5201.49" dur="4.68">ask you about Isis what was that buddy</text>
  <text start="5203.14" dur="5.55">well no just going back to yeah how you</text>
  <text start="5206.17" dur="6.59">started this particular part of the</text>
  <text start="5208.69" dur="7.94">conversation about that Isis leader who</text>
  <text start="5212.76" dur="7.27">you know Russia is claiming they killed</text>
  <text start="5216.63" dur="6.43">does it even matter like what what I do</text>
  <text start="5220.03" dur="4.92">i that is right tom you know like okay</text>
  <text start="5223.06" dur="3.36">they killed one leader won&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="5224.95" dur="3.9">somebody else just kind of take his</text>
  <text start="5226.42" dur="6.18">place or you know isn&amp;#39;t this stuff kind</text>
  <text start="5228.85" dur="6.36">of more ideological than it is like an</text>
  <text start="5232.6" dur="4.2">actual organization in the sense that</text>
  <text start="5235.21" dur="5.73">like okay you could take out its head</text>
  <text start="5236.8" dur="6.18">and there&amp;#39;s still other cells in the</text>
  <text start="5240.94" dur="6.66">world there&amp;#39;s other you know people</text>
  <text start="5242.98" dur="6.06">ready to to commit attacks and things</text>
  <text start="5247.6" dur="4.95">like this so in a sense it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="5249.04" dur="6.09">like you know over the last 10 years or</text>
  <text start="5252.55" dur="4.2">so I&amp;#39;ve heard many times such a</text>
  <text start="5255.13" dur="5.43">leader of al-qaeda such an such a leader</text>
  <text start="5256.75" dur="5.43">of whatever has been killed but it it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5260.56" dur="4.4">almost like a false sense of security</text>
  <text start="5262.18" dur="5.01">like okay now everything will be better</text>
  <text start="5264.96" dur="5.14">so so my question is like does it</text>
  <text start="5267.19" dur="5">doesn&amp;#39;t matter if they killed this head</text>
  <text start="5270.1" dur="6.76">Isis guy</text>
  <text start="5272.19" dur="8.15">it could matter Julie to look at the</text>
  <text start="5276.86" dur="6.64">death of a military or political leader</text>
  <text start="5280.34" dur="6.55">one is it&amp;#39;s just another soldier right</text>
  <text start="5283.5" dur="5.489">so Isis has how many thousands of people</text>
  <text start="5286.89" dur="4.47">fighting the war you&amp;#39;d kill one okay</text>
  <text start="5288.989" dur="4.111">great well yes others there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="5291.36" dur="4.43">lieutenants and generals are going to</text>
  <text start="5293.1" dur="5.55">take step up and we left the rank and</text>
  <text start="5295.79" dur="4.42">you&amp;#39;re just killing one leader that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5298.65" dur="4.29">one way to look at it the other way to</text>
  <text start="5300.21" dur="5.22">look at it as leaders are leaders</text>
  <text start="5302.94" dur="6">because they have abilities and talents</text>
  <text start="5305.43" dur="9.11">that are not common to all the soldiers</text>
  <text start="5308.94" dur="10.2">in the war so al-baghdadi was I believe</text>
  <text start="5314.54" dur="6.28">recognized as a great strategist and if</text>
  <text start="5319.14" dur="4.74">you take out someone who is a chief</text>
  <text start="5320.82" dur="4.56">strategist for an organization we kind</text>
  <text start="5323.88" dur="4.17">of crippled the ability for that</text>
  <text start="5325.38" dur="5.55">organization to come up with good</text>
  <text start="5328.05" dur="6.09">strategic plans to move their operation</text>
  <text start="5330.93" dur="6.75">forward would be like taking out the CEO</text>
  <text start="5334.14" dur="5.97">of a company what happened when Steve</text>
  <text start="5337.68" dur="4.83">Jobs was no longer had an apple Apple</text>
  <text start="5340.11" dur="5.1">has suffered since Steve Jobs</text>
  <text start="5342.51" dur="6.209">you know is no longer the CEO and the</text>
  <text start="5345.21" dur="5.279">owner you can look at it that way you</text>
  <text start="5348.719" dur="7.051">can look at it and picking out the head</text>
  <text start="5350.489" dur="8.46">is it does disrupt the district strategy</text>
  <text start="5355.77" dur="5.28">and the planning and it could be</text>
  <text start="5358.949" dur="4.441">demoralizing to the truth it could be</text>
  <text start="5361.05" dur="3.739">loyal to him yes I&amp;#39;m no specific place</text>
  <text start="5363.39" dur="3.049">but</text>
  <text start="5364.789" dur="3.66">it could be seen that way and you know</text>
  <text start="5366.439" dur="6.14">at the end of the day</text>
  <text start="5368.449" dur="9.42">Isis is on borrowed time maddis is</text>
  <text start="5372.579" dur="8.56">bombing and there is heavy heavy losses</text>
  <text start="5377.869" dur="6.33">every day with Isis they are becoming</text>
  <text start="5381.139" dur="5.31">extinct we&amp;#39;ve got a coalition they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="5384.199" dur="4.47">got them surrounded it&amp;#39;s only going to</text>
  <text start="5386.449" dur="4.82">be a matter of a few more weeks from may</text>
  <text start="5388.669" dur="5.79">be months before Isis is pretty much</text>
  <text start="5391.269" dur="4.45">effectively eliminated David what do you</text>
  <text start="5394.459" dur="4.14">what do you think about the</text>
  <text start="5395.719" dur="5.94">cryptocurrency craze I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5398.599" dur="6.74">interesting I don&amp;#39;t have any revelation</text>
  <text start="5401.659" dur="6.121">from God on cryptocurrency you know I</text>
  <text start="5405.339" dur="4.99">like you I know a lot of people who are</text>
  <text start="5407.78" dur="4.5">interested in it I think it&amp;#39;s great up</text>
  <text start="5410.329" dur="3.75">and coming it&amp;#39;s going to reach some</text>
  <text start="5412.28" dur="5.459">people would go so far to fix and</text>
  <text start="5414.079" dur="8.42">replace conventional currency I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="5417.739" dur="7.11">some research on it I&amp;#39;m not convinced</text>
  <text start="5422.499" dur="5.14">I&amp;#39;m always a little bit leery about fads</text>
  <text start="5424.849" dur="7.411">and crazy one of my concerns is that</text>
  <text start="5427.639" dur="7.02">it&amp;#39;s a digital courtesy and you really</text>
