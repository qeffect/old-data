  <text start="205.829" dur="2.61">it happens the first time like I have a</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="3.36">number of people that I&amp;#39;ve kind of</text>

  <text start="238.59" dur="5.429">looking at this going what is this all</text>
  <text start="241.169" dur="4.261">about what did you tell him I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="244.019" dur="2.731">remember what I said to him but I mean I</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="2.79">think I saw Lee said something really</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="2.76">simple like that it&amp;#39;s a gem it came from</text>
  <text start="248.22" dur="2.639">heaven go on it side because there&amp;#39;s a</text>

  <text start="253.229" dur="5.82">on that night by text message the five</text>
  <text start="256.349" dur="4.32">gemstones that he found and his story</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="4.261">was I was sitting on the couch I was</text>
  <text start="260.669" dur="5.161">looking at the floor and I was staring</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="4.59">at this one spot and I glanced away for</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="3.54">a split second and then looked back and</text>
  <text start="267.9" dur="3.54">boom there was a gemstone right there</text>
  <text start="269.37" dur="3.39">right he had just been looking yeah they</text>
  <text start="271.44" dur="2.699">don&amp;#39;t look here like that I mean</text>
  <text start="272.76" dur="2.76">literally you can be looking at a spot</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="3.121">you look away you look back and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="3.119">a stone there and then you pick it up</text>
  <text start="277.26" dur="3">and you look away and you look back and</text>
  <text start="278.639" dur="3.511">there&amp;#39;s another stone there and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.26" dur="2.33">like okay I know the first one wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="282.15" dur="2.09">there</text>
  <text start="282.59" dur="3.51">but after I picked the first one up I</text>
  <text start="284.24" dur="4.5">know for a fact that the second one</text>
  <text start="286.1" dur="5.16">wasn&amp;#39;t there so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s sort of one of</text>
  <text start="288.74" dur="4.35">those ways I think God sort of</text>
  <text start="291.26" dur="3.63">encourages our faith and gives us these</text>
  <text start="293.09" dur="4.56">moments where okay this really is</text>
  <text start="294.89" dur="4.8">outside of my box and experience but he</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="3.78">almost gives us confirming circumstances</text>
  <text start="299.69" dur="3.9">when this happens so we really know that</text>
  <text start="301.43" dur="3.54">we know that we know that it wasn&amp;#39;t just</text>
  <text start="303.59" dur="3.27">something that we were making up or</text>
  <text start="304.97" dur="3.24">somebody else put there I know what a</text>
  <text start="306.86" dur="2.61">lot of people are gonna be wondering you</text>
  <text start="308.21" dur="4.43">know well why would God do something</text>
  <text start="309.47" dur="6.42">like this and I&amp;#39;ll give you one</text>
  <text start="312.64" dur="6.73">experience from my son that I think</text>
  <text start="315.89" dur="6.12">speaks to why he does this so after he</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="4.86">went home from the party he sent me this</text>
  <text start="322.01" dur="3.98">message and he showed me you know the</text>
  <text start="324.23" dur="5.07">picture of the stones he took home and</text>
  <text start="325.99" dur="5.56">he was a junior in college and like a</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="4.8">lot of people who are in college his</text>
  <text start="331.55" dur="5.16">faith in his relationship with God was</text>
  <text start="334.1" dur="5.01">kind of getting a little bit lukewarm</text>
  <text start="336.71" dur="3.93">you know he was really getting into his</text>
  <text start="339.11" dur="3.51">studies and unfortunately he didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="340.64" dur="3.06">into a lot of party you know he was in</text>
  <text start="342.62" dur="2.79">the Coast Guard Reserve and he was</text>
  <text start="343.7" dur="4.71">taking it&amp;#39;s trying to get two degrees</text>
  <text start="345.41" dur="5.07">finished but he didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="3.45">time to spend developing his</text>
  <text start="350.48" dur="3.84">relationship with God there so he</text>
  <text start="351.86" dur="4.71">thought but when he came home after the</text>
  <text start="354.32" dur="4.47">gemstone party and he started to think</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="4.2">about these gemstones and what God was</text>
  <text start="358.79" dur="3.87">saying through them he really did kind</text>
  <text start="360.77" dur="3.78">of change his perspective on the</text>
  <text start="362.66" dur="3.63">goodness of God because he thought well</text>
  <text start="364.55" dur="4.56">if God gives us these kind of things</text>
  <text start="366.29" dur="4.62">just randomly he must be really a lot</text>
  <text start="369.11" dur="3.99">better than I imagined him I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="370.91" dur="5.99">exactly what he was thinking God was all</text>
  <text start="373.1" dur="7.98">about but that experience drew him into</text>
  <text start="376.9" dur="6.52">God&amp;#39;s presence a little more and from</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="4.41">that point on during his college career</text>
  <text start="383.42" dur="5.01">as he went into his senior year he</text>
  <text start="385.49" dur="5.01">became a lot more interested in learning</text>
  <text start="388.43" dur="3.84">more about God we started talking on</text>
  <text start="390.5" dur="3.84">every Friday morning he would call me we</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="3.87">have discussions about the Bible and</text>
  <text start="394.34" dur="3.84">discussions about what God had been</text>
  <text start="396.14" dur="5.34">doing and he&amp;#39;d start having more God</text>
  <text start="398.18" dur="7.05">dreams and I think the gemstone party</text>
  <text start="401.48" dur="6.75">was kind of a high-water mark for him</text>
  <text start="405.23" dur="5.07">where God became a lot more tangible and</text>
  <text start="408.23" dur="4.26">real and he became a lot more interested</text>
  <text start="410.3" dur="3.27">in knowing what God was all about that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.49" dur="2.12">pretty cool I&amp;#39;ve never heard that before</text>
  <text start="413.57" dur="2.119">I mean I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="2.609">but he&amp;#39;s never told me about that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="415.689" dur="2.7">pretty neat one of the things that I</text>
  <text start="417.219" dur="3.151">think that God&amp;#39;s doing with the</text>
  <text start="418.389" dur="4.201">gemstones is exactly what you said like</text>
  <text start="420.37" dur="4.28">there&amp;#39;s this invisible God that we know</text>
  <text start="422.59" dur="4.949">lives out there somewhere and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="424.65" dur="5.019">supposed to care about us but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="427.539" dur="4.711">really hard to make that invisible non</text>
  <text start="429.669" dur="4.231">tangible being visible and tangible and</text>
  <text start="432.25" dur="3.509">when you have these gems show up and and</text>
  <text start="433.9" dur="3.9">when I say they show up I mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="435.759" dur="3.451">they&amp;#39;re cut stones there are all sorts</text>
  <text start="437.8" dur="4.049">of shapes and sizes there all sorts of</text>
  <text start="439.21" dur="5.489">colors and they don&amp;#39;t disappear at liter</text>
  <text start="441.849" dur="5.521">so our oldest stones cut or some of them</text>
  <text start="444.699" dur="5.101">work I think I and I&amp;#39;ve seen probably</text>
  <text start="447.37" dur="5.909">tens of thousands of stones at this</text>
  <text start="449.8" dur="5.76">point I&amp;#39;ve seen one that wasn&amp;#39;t cut okay</text>
  <text start="453.279" dur="4.89">and sometimes they show up second sober</text>
  <text start="455.56" dur="5.069">and jazzy I mean some what settings</text>
  <text start="458.169" dur="4.171">there was one that showed up in there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="460.629" dur="4.56">only one that I know of that showed up</text>
  <text start="462.34" dur="4.949">at my house in a setting and it was this</text>
  <text start="465.189" dur="3.931">big like almost when I say it was like</text>
  <text start="467.289" dur="5.31">amethyst quartz or something like that</text>
  <text start="469.12" dur="5.549">but it should have been actually had a</text>
  <text start="472.599" dur="4.231">hole in the top of it was a big teardrop</text>
  <text start="474.669" dur="5.22">hole on the top of it with a little</text>
  <text start="476.83" dur="4.739">silver ring around it that&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="479.889" dur="4.62">and I mean I&amp;#39;ve seen some other ones</text>
  <text start="481.569" dur="5.581">that had one that&amp;#39;s a like a crescent</text>
  <text start="484.509" dur="4.02">moon and a silver looking setting I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="487.15" dur="3.06">just all sorts of really different</text>
  <text start="488.529" dur="4.741">pretty stuff I&amp;#39;ve seen one that the</text>
  <text start="490.21" dur="4.949">setting was I&amp;#39;m actually a leaf and it</text>
  <text start="493.27" dur="3.6">was just pierced through the top of the</text>
  <text start="495.159" dur="4.021">stone and it&amp;#39;s a pendant again that you</text>
  <text start="496.87" dur="5.609">can stick a chain through wow that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="6.989">cool so you got together with them and</text>
  <text start="502.479" dur="6.451">you got introduced to what kind of</text>
  <text start="506.169" dur="5.041">certain with gemstones and then you</text>
  <text start="508.93" dur="4.62">invited them over to your place to have</text>
  <text start="511.21" dur="3.93">some get-togethers where other people</text>
  <text start="513.55" dur="3.659">would show up and can you talk a little</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="5.009">bit about what happened there yes so</text>
  <text start="517.209" dur="5.64">about a year after we experienced this</text>
  <text start="520.149" dur="5.071">and had met this couple I just really</text>
  <text start="522.849" dur="5.281">had it on my heart that I wanted people</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="4.979">to have more experiences with God that</text>
  <text start="528.13" dur="4.41">and the supernatural as a whole I really</text>
  <text start="530.199" dur="4.561">value miracles and I have a high value</text>
  <text start="532.54" dur="5.039">for the supernatural because I believe</text>
  <text start="534.76" dur="5.66">that the miraculous and the things that</text>
  <text start="537.579" dur="5.461">take us outside of our normal routine</text>
  <text start="540.42" dur="4.149">those are the things that help transform</text>
  <text start="543.04" dur="4.109">our understanding and transform our</text>
  <text start="544.569" dur="4.021">belief systems so that when God says all</text>
  <text start="547.149" dur="3.151">things are possible</text>
  <text start="548.59" dur="3.9">we really don&amp;#39;t most of the time believe</text>
  <text start="550.3" dur="3.72">all things are possible so so we I want</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="4.11">to believe that the things we&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="554.02" dur="4.26">experiences with already or possible and</text>
  <text start="556.6" dur="3.21">maybes we haven&amp;#39;t experienced or</text>
  <text start="558.28" dur="3.27">probably not possible mostly they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="559.81" dur="3.21">possible and a lot of things will tell</text>
  <text start="561.55" dur="3.51">you aren&amp;#39;t possible even though the</text>
  <text start="563.02" dur="4.17">Bible says with God all things are</text>
  <text start="565.06" dur="3.66">possible we just assume all means a very</text>
  <text start="567.19" dur="3.72">limited view have you ever looked up</text>
  <text start="568.72" dur="3.9">what all means in the Greek I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="3.51">but I&amp;#39;ve had other people who haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="572.62" dur="6.87">I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that they told me it</text>
  <text start="574.42" dur="7.95">means all so when God says all things</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="4.32">are possible I just and I really feel we</text>
  <text start="582.37" dur="2.94">need to open up our understanding what</text>
  <text start="583.81" dur="3.51">that looks like so I wanted to have jump</text>
  <text start="585.31" dur="4.56">parties which was I mean that was the</text>
  <text start="587.32" dur="5.28">title I came up with for them because we</text>
  <text start="589.87" dur="4.59">didn&amp;#39;t have some deep spiritual plan of</text>
  <text start="592.6" dur="3.12">what we were doing it wasn&amp;#39;t like a</text>
  <text start="594.46" dur="2.73">church service it was just to get</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="3.33">together our house we had people you</text>
  <text start="597.19" dur="4.29">know common fellowship hang out bring</text>
  <text start="599.05" dur="5.67">bring food or don&amp;#39;t bring food we love</text>
  <text start="601.48" dur="4.98">you either way just come and literally I</text>
  <text start="604.72" dur="4.23">mean we spend like 12 hours for the day</text>
  <text start="606.46" dur="3.6">like from like 10 the morning didn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="608.95" dur="3.75">on the evening or something we had like</text>
  <text start="610.06" dur="5.16">a good long period Tyler just hey come</text>
  <text start="612.7" dur="4.65">over hang out get gemstones get blessed</text>
  <text start="615.22" dur="4.05">by God and the first one we did I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="617.35" dur="3.51">really know how it was gonna go people</text>
  <text start="619.27" dur="3.18">and we had probably almost 30 people</text>
  <text start="620.86" dur="4.74">show up and of course the entire day</text>
  <text start="622.45" dur="4.95">which doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a lot except</text>
  <text start="625.6" dur="3.99">that they stayed for like four and five</text>
  <text start="627.4" dur="3.36">hours at a time so you get a house for</text>
  <text start="629.59" dur="3.12">people you know a house full of people</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="3.63">and it was really cool because I think</text>
  <text start="632.71" dur="5.4">the one overarching thing that I think</text>
  <text start="634.39" dur="5.61">everybody really left feeling at the end</text>
  <text start="638.11" dur="4.32">of the day they just felt incredibly</text>
  <text start="640" dur="4.8">loved which I mean I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="642.43" dur="5.04">people expect they should feel at the</text>
  <text start="644.8" dur="4.44">end of something like that but they just</text>
  <text start="647.47" dur="3.99">people felt incredibly loved because you</text>
  <text start="649.24" dur="5.4">have this invisible God out there</text>
  <text start="651.46" dur="5.19">somewhere who cares enough about you to</text>
  <text start="654.64" dur="4.29">hand you these physical tangible things</text>
  <text start="656.65" dur="4.74">that you can take home you can put them</text>
  <text start="658.93" dur="3.75">in jewelry you can just sit and stare at</text>
  <text start="661.39" dur="3.93">them but I mean it&amp;#39;s something that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="662.68" dur="3.69">tactile you can hold it you can taste it</text>
  <text start="665.32" dur="2.37">if you really want to although they</text>
  <text start="666.37" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t really taste like anything but you</text>
  <text start="667.69" dur="4.23">can touch it you can feel it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="669.91" dur="4.11">this tangible reminder of this</text>
  <text start="671.92" dur="4.47">intangible God it&amp;#39;s no longer just this</text>
  <text start="674.02" dur="5.85">theoretical thing out there it&amp;#39;s now</text>
  <text start="676.39" dur="5.05">become like really real right so you had</text>
  <text start="679.87" dur="3.94">more than one</text>
  <text start="681.44" dur="3.839">yeah we had antenna gathering like every</text>
  <text start="683.81" dur="4.469">two to three months for the over the</text>
  <text start="685.279" dur="5.49">course of about a year and you continue</text>
  <text start="688.279" dur="4.591">to see a lot of gemstones show up at</text>
  <text start="690.769" dur="4.291">these gatherings yeah I know how many</text>
  <text start="692.87" dur="4.05">gemstones were showing up each time the</text>
  <text start="695.06" dur="4.079">first one and it&amp;#39;s kind of hard to</text>
  <text start="696.92" dur="4.709">estimate the the first God party we had</text>
  <text start="699.139" dur="4.861">um party we had at least 4,000 stones</text>
  <text start="701.629" dur="4.861">show up a new basis on the fact that</text>
  <text start="704" dur="4.949">there were 20 to 30 people there each of</text>
  <text start="706.49" dur="3.899">them took home a bag full of stones full</text>
  <text start="708.949" dur="3.421">of stones and when I say a bag full of</text>
  <text start="710.389" dur="4.111">stones I mean the stones I personally</text>
  <text start="712.37" dur="4.38">came away with was more than 50 just</text>
  <text start="714.5" dur="4.709">that particular day and I was handing</text>
  <text start="716.75" dur="3.75">stones to other people because I want to</text>
  <text start="719.209" dur="5.851">make sure everybody else did I know</text>
  <text start="720.5" dur="7.079">there was one one teenager he he had</text>
  <text start="725.06" dur="3.99">over a hundred stones when he left and</text>
  <text start="727.579" dur="3.06">then I have again there was like eight</text>
  <text start="729.05" dur="3.329">people in my extended family who were</text>
  <text start="730.639" dur="3.601">there there&amp;#39;s a couple of other friends</text>
  <text start="732.379" dur="4.591">who I asked him and I know that each had</text>
  <text start="734.24" dur="4.62">like 50 to 100 stones each so when I</text>
  <text start="736.97" dur="4.83">just added up the total number of people</text>
  <text start="738.86" dur="5.07">it was literally it was around 4,000 or</text>
  <text start="741.8" dur="4.979">more that&amp;#39;s pretty cool</text>
  <text start="743.93" dur="6.57">and that continued so you were having</text>
  <text start="746.779" dur="6.331">these gemstone meetings every 3-4 months</text>
  <text start="750.5" dur="5.009">people would come over more stones</text>
  <text start="753.11" dur="4.2">dropping mm-hmm no sometimes they would</text>
  <text start="755.509" dur="3.45">literally drop out of the air and hit</text>
  <text start="757.31" dur="4.35">the floor people would hear them land</text>
  <text start="758.959" dur="5.521">yeah other times that you&amp;#39;d have a</text>
  <text start="761.66" dur="4.679">coffee cup sitting on the table a stone</text>
  <text start="764.48" dur="3.57">would appear by the coffee cup and then</text>
  <text start="766.339" dur="2.701">they&amp;#39;d pick it up and the company</text>
  <text start="768.05" dur="3.06">decided to be another one they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="769.04" dur="3.599">exactly where sometimes there was one</text>
  <text start="771.11" dur="3.81">time that was pretty cool we actually</text>
  <text start="772.639" dur="4.62">but put a gemstone for one of my</text>
  <text start="774.92" dur="2.909">granddaughter&amp;#39;s in like a little cigar</text>
  <text start="777.259" dur="2.401">box</text>
  <text start="777.829" dur="3.661">well we open the box like five minutes</text>
  <text start="779.66" dur="3.39">later and it was a second smaller</text>
  <text start="781.49" dur="3.51">version of the same stone sitting right</text>
  <text start="783.05" dur="4.349">axes and there is some really cool</text>
  <text start="785" dur="3.899">stories about how and when and why some</text>
  <text start="787.399" dur="3.331">of these stones have shown up which</text>
  <text start="788.899" dur="4.321">we&amp;#39;ll talk about a little bit so the</text>
  <text start="790.73" dur="4.5">parties continue are the parties so the</text>
  <text start="793.22" dur="5.13">gatherings are continuing their parties</text>
  <text start="795.23" dur="5.969">me party I call them just parties okay</text>
  <text start="798.35" dur="5.31">Jim parties there and people are</text>
  <text start="801.199" dur="3.99">continuing to get stones now what is</text>
  <text start="803.66" dur="4.08">going through your mind at this point</text>
  <text start="805.189" dur="4.26">well I mean there&amp;#39;s a couple things one</text>
  <text start="807.74" dur="5.19">it was doing exactly what I wanted it to</text>
  <text start="809.449" dur="5.431">do it was giving people experiences that</text>
  <text start="812.93" dur="2.409">were outside of their previous realm of</text>
  <text start="814.88" dur="2.11">extreme</text>
  <text start="815.339" dur="4.23">and when it comes to miracles and the</text>
  <text start="816.99" dur="4.349">supernatural we&amp;#39;ve always learned in</text>
  <text start="819.569" dur="3.241">life based on our experiences a lot of</text>
  <text start="821.339" dur="3.271">things we believe if we&amp;#39;re honest with</text>
  <text start="822.81" dur="3.269">ourselves we believe not based on what</text>
  <text start="824.61" dur="2.849">we say well the Bible says this so I</text>
  <text start="826.079" dur="2.67">believe it we really believe it because</text>
  <text start="827.459" dur="3.781">that&amp;#39;s what our life experience has</text>
  <text start="828.749" dur="3.661">taught us so one of the things that was</text>
  <text start="831.24" dur="4.529">happening was people were learning</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="6.869">something new about God through a new</text>
  <text start="835.769" dur="5.221">experience but in addition of that I was</text>
  <text start="839.279" dur="3.6">actually starting to get used to it so</text>
  <text start="840.99" dur="3.36">but I don&amp;#39;t feel like that was a bad</text>
  <text start="842.879" dur="3.15">thing I felt like it just meant I was</text>
  <text start="844.35" dur="4.469">getting more comfortable so I&amp;#39;m starting</text>
  <text start="846.029" dur="4.56">to expect it more so my faith level for</text>
  <text start="848.819" dur="3.721">gemstones was definitely going up</text>
  <text start="850.589" dur="3.511">because it was something that was</text>
  <text start="852.54" dur="4.289">becoming more common in my life</text>
  <text start="854.1" dur="5.789">experience right but still the gemstones</text>
  <text start="856.829" dur="5.13">were only appearing when they came over</text>
  <text start="859.889" dur="5.13">they weren&amp;#39;t showing up at your house</text>
  <text start="861.959" dur="4.081">yet except when they were there and it</text>
  <text start="865.019" dur="2.88">would actually when they were there I</text>
  <text start="866.04" dur="3.45">mean they might show up a day before</text>
  <text start="867.899" dur="3.511">they were there they might show up a</text>
  <text start="869.49" dur="3.029">couple days or a week or two after they</text>
  <text start="871.41" dur="2.969">were there but that it was always</text>
  <text start="872.519" dur="3.12">connected or surrounding their credit</text>
  <text start="874.379" dur="4.111">their presence in their business somehow</text>
  <text start="875.639" dur="5.49">do you have a theory yet on why they had</text>
  <text start="878.49" dur="3.329">this manifestation and other people</text>
  <text start="881.129" dur="2.19">don&amp;#39;t yeah</text>
  <text start="881.819" dur="3.96">so I think there&amp;#39;s a couple things I</text>
  <text start="883.319" dur="5.01">think one believe he has a gift of</text>
  <text start="885.779" dur="6.211">miracles for gemstones in 1st</text>
  <text start="888.329" dur="5.161">Corinthians 12 it talks about gifts of</text>
  <text start="891.99" dur="3.24">miraculous powers and it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="893.49" dur="2.909">plural it&amp;#39;s not a single gift of</text>
  <text start="895.23" dur="4.229">miracles it&amp;#39;s reckless</text>
  <text start="896.399" dur="6.511">powers formal so I believe that he has a</text>
  <text start="899.459" dur="5.82">gift of miraculous powers for the</text>
  <text start="902.91" dur="6.21">appearance of gemstones so some of that</text>
  <text start="905.279" dur="6.24">could look like manna or oil or gold</text>
  <text start="909.12" dur="5.969">dust feathers feathery synthetic</text>
  <text start="911.519" dur="5.37">gemstones various miraculous signs but</text>
  <text start="915.089" dur="4.86">you think his is specific to gemstones</text>
  <text start="916.889" dur="4.44">yes and no I mean he I&amp;#39;ve seen him had</text>
  <text start="919.949" dur="3.601">feathers show up I mean I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="921.329" dur="3.6">feathers show up even before we met him</text>
  <text start="923.55" dur="3.18">but he did I just never seen the</text>
  <text start="924.929" dur="4.08">magnitude he hasn&amp;#39;t appear you have a</text>
  <text start="926.73" dur="4.199">pretty decent gift for gold dust I know</text>
  <text start="929.009" dur="4.111">that can animate it appear on my fingers</text>
  <text start="930.929" dur="4.53">and yours well yeah I mean as some of</text>
  <text start="933.12" dur="4.079">that is I think a faith thing for me to</text>
  <text start="935.459" dur="3.331">is literally if I look at my fingers</text>
  <text start="937.199" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;ll usually start to see them start to</text>
  <text start="938.79" dur="4.889">sparkle like yeah I&amp;#39;m doing it now and</text>
  <text start="941.699" dur="3.661">they&amp;#39;re starting sparkles and it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="943.679" dur="4.711">it&amp;#39;s summer that&amp;#39;s a faith thing I mean</text>
  <text start="945.36" dur="5.67">my stepdaughter has she has times</text>
  <text start="948.39" dur="4.8">I mean it&amp;#39;s like somebody painted her</text>
  <text start="951.03" dur="4.35">face with glitter because there was so</text>
  <text start="953.19" dur="5.34">much of it I literally I could wipe my</text>
  <text start="955.38" dur="5.25">hand on her like her arm or her cheek or</text>
  <text start="958.53" dur="3.93">wherever it is and wipe it on something</text>
  <text start="960.63" dur="3.54">and these something will start sparkling</text>
  <text start="962.46" dur="3.72">if I do that when I&amp;#39;m just looking at my</text>
  <text start="964.17" dur="3.84">finger it&amp;#39;s just kind of expecting it I</text>
  <text start="966.18" dur="3.93">wipe it on anything and nothing happens</text>
  <text start="968.01" dur="3.6">right but there&amp;#39;s just so much of it</text>
  <text start="970.11" dur="3.84">coming off of her at that point in time</text>
  <text start="971.61" dur="4.17">that it&amp;#39;s just prolific it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="973.95" dur="4.02">really a mess pretty spectacular I do</text>
  <text start="975.78" dur="3.06">think it is a gift and I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="977.97" dur="3.03">like I said there&amp;#39;s different these</text>
  <text start="978.84" dur="4.35">supernatural manifestations I think in</text>
  <text start="981" dur="4.26">some ways they start out by being a gift</text>
  <text start="983.19" dur="4.56">but I think there&amp;#39;s another element and</text>
  <text start="985.26" dur="4.47">that has to do with angelic present so</text>
  <text start="987.75" dur="5.1">one of the things that we definitely</text>
  <text start="989.73" dur="5.16">noticed happen is some friends and I</text>
  <text start="992.85" dur="3.96">will also sense angels somewhere in the</text>
  <text start="994.89" dur="3.84">room and then gems will show up over</text>
  <text start="996.81" dur="4.02">there so we can tell there&amp;#39;s an angel</text>
  <text start="998.73" dur="3.93">over there and then gems appear and it</text>
  <text start="1000.83" dur="5.16">seems like the angels may be bringing</text>
  <text start="1002.66" dur="4.83">the gems as well right so it&amp;#39;s not just</text>
  <text start="1005.99" dur="3.69">connected to a gift but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="1007.49" dur="3.93">connected to angelic presence so yeah</text>
  <text start="1009.68" dur="4.71">that doesn&amp;#39;t surprise me which would</text>
  <text start="1011.42" dur="4.86">also explain how you know the the gem</text>
  <text start="1014.39" dur="4.26">can show up two weeks after these people</text>
  <text start="1016.28" dur="5.4">no longer at our house because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1018.65" dur="6">connected to their visit but the angel</text>
  <text start="1021.68" dur="4.62">may still be there or may have come back</text>
  <text start="1024.65" dur="3.87">two weeks later I mean I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1026.3" dur="3.69">the angels are doing specifically but it</text>
  <text start="1028.52" dur="3.03">would explain why they&amp;#39;re showing up</text>
  <text start="1029.99" dur="3.51">when they&amp;#39;re still now three hours north</text>
  <text start="1031.55" dur="3.72">and they&amp;#39;re not at my house to have a</text>
  <text start="1033.5" dur="2.97">gemstone there&amp;#39;s a lot of possible</text>
  <text start="1035.27" dur="4.29">explanations for it I mean if you</text>
  <text start="1036.47" dur="5.79">believe in portals it could be that they</text>
  <text start="1039.56" dur="5.13">come and they open a portal that is a</text>
  <text start="1042.26" dur="3.9">gateway to heaven and then the</text>
  <text start="1044.69" dur="2.94">manifestations come through the portal</text>
  <text start="1046.16" dur="2.79">appearance in the Angels there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1047.63" dur="3.3">of different ways you can explain it I</text>
  <text start="1048.95" dur="4.62">don&amp;#39;t know that there&amp;#39;s one explanation</text>
  <text start="1050.93" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s right or wrong as they were</text>
  <text start="1053.57" dur="4.65">showing up and you&amp;#39;re having these</text>
  <text start="1055.46" dur="5.31">parties you started to think you know</text>
  <text start="1058.22" dur="4.62">the Lord would really be cool if I could</text>
  <text start="1060.77" dur="4.41">have these manifests and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1062.84" dur="4.5">here yeah I mean who wouldn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1065.18" dur="3.63">manifest running around you instead of</text>
  <text start="1067.34" dur="3.9">waiting for somebody yeah so how did</text>
  <text start="1068.81" dur="6.75">that evolve so that actually was a bit</text>
  <text start="1071.24" dur="5.55">longer of a process for about actually</text>
  <text start="1075.56" dur="2.88">the first time I met that I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1076.79" dur="3.64">back up a little bit but the first time</text>
  <text start="1078.44" dur="3.31">we met them after we met them</text>
  <text start="1080.43" dur="3.45">you know we&amp;#39;re experienced it for the</text>
  <text start="1081.75" dur="5.01">first time like I said my mind was blown</text>
  <text start="1083.88" dur="5.49">so I started praying to have that happen</text>
  <text start="1086.76" dur="5.58">to and God told me not to pray for it</text>
  <text start="1089.37" dur="5.25">which is uncommon for me it&amp;#39;s honestly</text>
  <text start="1092.34" dur="3.78">pretty uncommon for me because I pretty</text>
  <text start="1094.62" dur="4.17">much believe that we&amp;#39;re allowed to have</text>
  <text start="1096.12" dur="5.31">whatever we want and God usually doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1098.79" dur="4.35">disagree with me because I think he</text>
  <text start="1101.43" dur="4.56">agrees but he actually told me not to</text>
  <text start="1103.14" dur="4.74">pray about this and a year later we</text>
  <text start="1105.99" dur="3.48">ended up having these gym parties so I</text>
  <text start="1107.88" dur="3.09">could kind of see okay God saying don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1109.47" dur="3">pray about this because I&amp;#39;ve already got</text>
  <text start="1110.97" dur="4.02">it worked out so don&amp;#39;t waste your time</text>
  <text start="1112.47" dur="4.65">focus on other things but then after we</text>
  <text start="1114.99" dur="4.35">kind of stop having to jump parties I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1117.12" dur="3.96">still like it was actually waited at the</text>
  <text start="1119.34" dur="3.57">end of last year I was kind of like we</text>
  <text start="1121.08" dur="4.47">really hadn&amp;#39;t had gems showing up except</text>
  <text start="1122.91" dur="4.83">one maybe every four to six months very</text>
  <text start="1125.55" dur="3.93">rare and I was just like god I really</text>
  <text start="1127.74" dur="4.069">would like to see this happen</text>
  <text start="1129.48" dur="4.53">well sometime early January this year</text>
  <text start="1131.809" dur="4.811">God told me that the gems were gonna</text>
  <text start="1134.01" dur="5.58">start to show up and I think so it was</text>
  <text start="1136.62" dur="4.98">just in response to me asking and just</text>
  <text start="1139.59" dur="4.23">saying you know God like it bothers me</text>
  <text start="1141.6" dur="3.27">that you know your word says you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1143.82" dur="3.27">you&amp;#39;re not a respecter of persons you</text>
  <text start="1144.87" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t pick and choose between people but</text>
  <text start="1147.09" dur="4.23">in spite of that you know I&amp;#39;m not seeing</text>
  <text start="1149.22" dur="3.959">this thing which I waste like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1151.32" dur="4.14">picking you choosing dies I mean I have</text>
  <text start="1153.179" dur="3.541">a fairly high faith love word because of</text>
  <text start="1155.46" dur="3.09">the things I&amp;#39;ve experienced I&amp;#39;d say</text>
  <text start="1156.72" dur="3.93">compared to most people so I&amp;#39;m like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1158.55" dur="4.14">not understanding why I&amp;#39;m not seeing</text>
  <text start="1160.65" dur="4.92">what I would be expecting to be seeing</text>
  <text start="1162.69" dur="4.44">right um well I I deal with the same</text>
  <text start="1165.57" dur="3.989">thing in the realm of healing yeah or</text>
  <text start="1167.13" dur="4.5">dreams or whatever people come to me and</text>
  <text start="1169.559" dur="4.051">say well how come I can&amp;#39;t see people</text>
  <text start="1171.63" dur="3.35">healed you know what do you have that I</text>
  <text start="1173.61" dur="3.9">don&amp;#39;t and I&amp;#39;m like you have anything</text>
  <text start="1174.98" dur="4.42">other than I&amp;#39;ve probably prayed for</text>
  <text start="1177.51" dur="3.57">20,000 people are you haven&amp;#39;t you know</text>
  <text start="1179.4" dur="2.96">there is something to experience and I</text>
  <text start="1181.08" dur="3.84">think that does make a difference</text>
  <text start="1182.36" dur="5.92">because our own faith and belief really</text>
  <text start="1184.92" dur="5.25">it does it does alter the circumstances</text>
  <text start="1188.28" dur="4.649">surrounding it and I think it can create</text>
  <text start="1190.17" dur="4.77">an atmosphere that&amp;#39;s more open for</text>
  <text start="1192.929" dur="3.781">healing or miracles or whatever it is I</text>
  <text start="1194.94" dur="3.66">think it can create a greater openness</text>
  <text start="1196.71" dur="4.59">for that to happen but it doesn&amp;#39;t in and</text>
  <text start="1198.6" dur="4.32">of itself force it to happen okay I want</text>
  <text start="1201.3" dur="4.53">to take a little segue here have you</text>
  <text start="1202.92" dur="5.34">ever asked them how the gemstones</text>
  <text start="1205.83" dur="6.09">started to manifest in their lives yes</text>
  <text start="1208.26" dur="4.62">so they went and spoke to some people</text>
  <text start="1211.92" dur="4.8">over</text>
  <text start="1212.88" dur="6.12">I hope back in I say this the early</text>
  <text start="1216.72" dur="5.21">2000s when this was really breaking out</text>
  <text start="1219" dur="5.55">at this one Church in Coeur d&amp;#39;Alene so</text>
  <text start="1221.93" dur="4.12">they went and talked to this couple who</text>
  <text start="1224.55" dur="3.54">had these gemstones that were literally</text>
  <text start="1226.05" dur="3.42">appearing in their front yard and these</text>
  <text start="1228.09" dur="3.9">were like big stones I mean they were</text>
  <text start="1229.47" dur="4.56">like half-dollar sized so the heavy</text>
  <text start="1231.99" dur="3.99">stones appearing well I guess these</text>
  <text start="1234.03" dur="3.57">people either shook hands I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1235.98" dur="4.2">remember exactly how it happened but</text>
  <text start="1237.6" dur="4.38">basically he got knocked out in the</text>
  <text start="1240.18" dur="4.62">spirit and it was like laying on his</text>
  <text start="1241.98" dur="3.99">front lawn for some period of time and</text>
  <text start="1244.8" dur="2.37">basically from that point of time they</text>
  <text start="1245.97" dur="2.97">didn&amp;#39;t ask for anything super special</text>
  <text start="1247.17" dur="3.75">they didn&amp;#39;t pray some special magical</text>
  <text start="1248.94" dur="4.71">prayer it was literally just like God</text>
  <text start="1250.92" dur="4.56">just made it happen so he went to this</text>
  <text start="1253.65" dur="3.9">church he shook hands with the guy who</text>
  <text start="1255.48" dur="4.59">was having the gemstones manifest he</text>
  <text start="1257.55" dur="4.53">gets knocked out in the spirit and then</text>
  <text start="1260.07" dur="4.23">from that point forward he starts having</text>
  <text start="1262.08" dur="3.81">gemstones manifest basically yeah I mean</text>
  <text start="1264.3" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a little more detail to that but</text>
  <text start="1265.89" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s the short version is yeah it just</text>
  <text start="1268.02" dur="3.57">kind of happened there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="1269.43" dur="3.57">thing I&amp;#39;ve observed with a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1271.59" dur="2.88">that there&amp;#39;s a lot of times that things</text>
  <text start="1273" dur="3.09">are I&amp;#39;m gonna stay caught more than</text>
  <text start="1274.47" dur="3.3">talked it&amp;#39;s not something that you</text>
  <text start="1276.09" dur="3.36">necessarily learn and got this mental</text>
  <text start="1277.77" dur="4.14">understanding for it&amp;#39;s literally</text>
  <text start="1279.45" dur="4.95">something that rubs off on you right I</text>
  <text start="1281.91" dur="4.44">mean the term we tend to use impartation</text>
  <text start="1284.4" dur="3.75">but basically something that somebody</text>
  <text start="1286.35" dur="4.62">else had happening in their life</text>
  <text start="1288.15" dur="5.13">basically just rubbed off on you and now</text>
  <text start="1290.97" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;ve got it - earlier this year the</text>
  <text start="1293.28" dur="4.26">Lord starts telling you that gemstones</text>
  <text start="1295.56" dur="3.78">are going to start the period what were</text>
  <text start="1297.54" dur="3.87">you thinking at that time I was thinking</text>
  <text start="1299.34" dur="3.45">that degrees because I mean pretty much</text>
  <text start="1301.41" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s what I had been asking for so I</text>
  <text start="1302.79" dur="4.68">mean when God says to me gemstones like</text>
  <text start="1304.92" dur="4.38">we start appearing I&amp;#39;ll be honest I was</text>
  <text start="1307.47" dur="3.69">actually thinking okay based on the way</text>
  <text start="1309.3" dur="4.71">God says and does things that most</text>
  <text start="1311.16" dur="5.31">likely means sometime in September you</text>
  <text start="1314.01" dur="5.19">know we&amp;#39;ll start to find a gemstone or</text>
  <text start="1316.47" dur="4.2">two and it will literally start sometime</text>
  <text start="1319.2" dur="1.86">this year well that&amp;#39;s not exactly what</text>
  <text start="1320.67" dur="2.19">happened</text>
  <text start="1321.06" dur="3.74">I was I was a bit surprised at what did</text>
  <text start="1322.86" dur="4.98">happen we thin about a week and a half I</text>
  <text start="1324.8" dur="4.81">found the first gemstone on my</text>
  <text start="1327.84" dur="3.27">granddaughter&amp;#39;s bed it was like midnight</text>
  <text start="1329.61" dur="4.26">I was carrying her downstairs because</text>
  <text start="1331.11" dur="4.11">she had fallen asleep in our bed and I</text>
  <text start="1333.87" dur="2.82">put her on her bed but as I&amp;#39;m walking</text>
  <text start="1335.22" dur="2.91">towards the bed I see there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1336.69" dur="3.9">sitting on the edge of her bed and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1338.13" dur="4.68">thinking to myself that looks like what</text>
  <text start="1340.59" dur="3.57">I think it looks like but until I pick</text>
  <text start="1342.81" dur="3.57">it up I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1344.16" dur="5.73">think it is but it was this</text>
  <text start="1346.38" dur="5.22">brilliantly beautiful clear stone yeah</text>
  <text start="1349.89" dur="3.06">so I mean she kind of woke up at that</text>
  <text start="1351.6" dur="3.57">point in time when I&amp;#39;m like oh my god I</text>
  <text start="1352.95" dur="4.02">just been a Gentile and then my wife my</text>
  <text start="1355.17" dur="3.3">wife is absolutely adorable she squeals</text>
  <text start="1356.97" dur="3.39">she&amp;#39;s the cutest thing she like runs</text>
  <text start="1358.47" dur="4.65">around and like celebrates every single</text>
  <text start="1360.36" dur="4.11">time we find a gemstone and she&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1363.12" dur="3.6">fun I was look at when she finds them</text>
  <text start="1364.47" dur="2.67">she gets really excited about him it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1366.72" dur="2.94">cool</text>
  <text start="1367.14" dur="5.31">so you find one stone and then what</text>
  <text start="1369.66" dur="6.03">happened so I want to say I might have</text>
  <text start="1372.45" dur="5.13">found another stone like a month or so</text>
  <text start="1375.69" dur="3.24">later kind of randomly when we were</text>
  <text start="1377.58" dur="3.15">cleaning something out it was like in</text>
  <text start="1378.93" dur="2.76">the bottom bottom of a basket or</text>
  <text start="1380.73" dur="2.31">something like it was completely</text>
  <text start="1381.69" dur="3.21">unexpected we&amp;#39;re cleaning things to know</text>
  <text start="1383.04" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s a stone well again we&amp;#39;re used to</text>
  <text start="1384.9" dur="8.1">finding stones so the next time I found</text>
  <text start="1388.35" dur="7.34">one was during my stepdaughters wedding</text>
  <text start="1393" dur="4.98">ceremony actually was on our back patio</text>
  <text start="1395.69" dur="5.32">just in the morning earlier in the day</text>
  <text start="1397.98" dur="4.32">and there&amp;#39;s another clear stone so I</text>
  <text start="1401.01" dur="2.73">mean I gave it to her because I assumed</text>
  <text start="1402.3" dur="1.86">it was kind of from God to her on our</text>
  <text start="1403.74" dur="1.86">wedding day</text>
  <text start="1404.16" dur="3.33">wedding present I would I thought was</text>
  <text start="1405.6" dur="4.38">the coolest thing you know God cares God</text>
  <text start="1407.49" dur="4.71">cares about really meaningful stuff to</text>
  <text start="1409.98" dur="4.5">us yeah I mean some of the stones that</text>
  <text start="1412.2" dur="4.92">have appeared when you&amp;#39;ve told me of</text>
  <text start="1414.48" dur="4.89">their stories to me there&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="1417.12" dur="5.13">significance to the timing and the color</text>
  <text start="1419.37" dur="5.49">of the stone sometimes yeah so so</text>
  <text start="1422.25" dur="4.79">fast-forward we had we were because</text>
  <text start="1424.86" dur="4.77">we&amp;#39;re putting down flooring in our</text>
  <text start="1427.04" dur="4.18">dining room and again I mean this is I</text>
  <text start="1429.63" dur="2.73">mean I&amp;#39;ve had people ask me before who</text>
  <text start="1431.22" dur="2.55">what were you doing when you worshiping</text>
  <text start="1432.36" dur="4.08">a praying or fasting or what were you</text>
  <text start="1433.77" dur="5.16">doing no I was laying down flooring and</text>
  <text start="1436.44" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s not supposed to work that way yeah</text>
  <text start="1438.93" dur="4.56">well you know God&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s okay with</text>
  <text start="1442.11" dur="4.23">breaking her idea what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1443.49" dur="4.95">allowable but yeah I mean we were laying</text>
  <text start="1446.34" dur="3.6">down flooring and because we had had</text>
  <text start="1448.44" dur="3.72">these gym parties we&amp;#39;re also pulling up</text>
  <text start="1449.94" dur="4.53">carpeting to lay down flooring so I had</text>
  <text start="1452.16" dur="4.02">said early in the day hey I&amp;#39;m running</text>
  <text start="1454.47" dur="2.61">out to the store but you guys keep an</text>
  <text start="1456.18" dur="2.43">eye out while you&amp;#39;re pulling up</text>
  <text start="1457.08" dur="3.27">carpeting see if there are any gemstones</text>
  <text start="1458.61" dur="3.81">come through the carpet because you know</text>
  <text start="1460.35" dur="3.69">I like to think pretty creatively I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1462.42" dur="3.36">thinking of gemstones can appear above</text>
  <text start="1464.04" dur="3.03">the carpet on the carpet maybe there</text>
  <text start="1465.78" dur="2.88">will be some we just never caught from</text>
  <text start="1467.07" dur="3">two years ago that are under the carpet</text>
  <text start="1468.66" dur="2.79">I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="1470.07" dur="3.18">would like to sweep this under the rug</text>
  <text start="1471.45" dur="2.82">what are you telling me that God would</text>
  <text start="1473.25" dur="3.09">actually sweep them under the carpet</text>
  <text start="1474.27" dur="3.54">they did they did actually find one</text>
  <text start="1476.34" dur="2.31">while I was out at the store they found</text>
  <text start="1477.81" dur="3.57">one</text>
  <text start="1478.65" dur="5.91">we&amp;#39;re underneath the carpet because we</text>
  <text start="1481.38" dur="4.89">kind of started expecting them and so</text>
  <text start="1484.56" dur="3.45">they started appearing by one coffee cup</text>
  <text start="1486.27" dur="3.93">we&amp;#39;d set the coffee cup back down and</text>
  <text start="1488.01" dur="3.42">then they&amp;#39;d appear again and then we</text>
  <text start="1490.2" dur="2.73">started just finding them then we</text>
  <text start="1491.43" dur="3.72">started hearing them fall on the new</text>
  <text start="1492.93" dur="4.98">flooring we had just laid it took us two</text>
  <text start="1495.15" dur="5.61">days to lay one day&amp;#39;s worth of flooring</text>
  <text start="1497.91" dur="5.4">because we were having so much fun with</text>
  <text start="1500.76" dur="3.27">all these jokes showing them one of one</text>
  <text start="1503.31" dur="2.79">of the things you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="1504.03" dur="3.39">significant colors and things when I got</text>
  <text start="1506.1" dur="3">married there was sort of something</text>
  <text start="1507.42" dur="4.29">prophetically significant with my wife</text>
  <text start="1509.1" dur="3.9">and I thought blue sapphires like I said</text>
  <text start="1511.71" dur="3.84">in the over thousands gems that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1513" dur="5.19">seen show up I have never seen a blue</text>
  <text start="1515.55" dur="3.84">sapphire appear and you wonder why oh my</text>
  <text start="1518.19" dur="3.57">goodness I wanted one really badly I</text>
  <text start="1519.39" dur="5.01">actually was asking God to give me a</text>
  <text start="1521.76" dur="5.49">pair of rings with blue sapphires in</text>
  <text start="1524.4" dur="4.47">them I&amp;#39;m still asking for that by the</text>
  <text start="1527.25" dur="3.42">way I have a number of other rings and</text>
  <text start="1528.87" dur="5.19">things I want to but ask any show</text>
  <text start="1530.67" dur="6.69">receive but seek under the carpet usual</text>
  <text start="1534.06" dur="4.92">fun okay we still have two thirds of the</text>
  <text start="1537.36" dur="3.3">floor left to put down so there&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="1538.98" dur="4.08">time not to give a report on what you</text>
  <text start="1540.66" dur="4.17">find the guy actually found a blue</text>
  <text start="1543.06" dur="3.27">sapphire stone and there was a number of</text>
  <text start="1544.83" dur="3.66">other blue sapphires that showed up that</text>
  <text start="1546.33" dur="4.08">weekend it was impressive to me partly</text>
  <text start="1548.49" dur="4.38">because it was significant to me</text>
  <text start="1550.41" dur="5.88">personally and it wasn&amp;#39;t something that</text>
  <text start="1552.87" dur="4.68">had started with this other couple</text>
  <text start="1556.29" dur="4.11">I mean God bless the other couple will</text>
  <text start="1557.55" dur="4.8">be there wonderful I love them but it</text>
  <text start="1560.4" dur="4.38">was still significant to me that he</text>
  <text start="1562.35" dur="4.82">didn&amp;#39;t that particular stone for us</text>
  <text start="1564.78" dur="5.43">didn&amp;#39;t start with them you got a unique</text>
  <text start="1567.17" dur="6.01">manifestation yeah and it was something</text>
  <text start="1570.21" dur="11.1">that God gave you that was the answer to</text>
  <text start="1573.18" dur="9.45">probably unspoken prayer but I mean but</text>
  <text start="1581.31" dur="3.12">it wasn&amp;#39;t just that it was this book in</text>
  <text start="1582.63" dur="3.87">prayer or something - it was also that</text>
  <text start="1584.43" dur="5.52">it was it was particularly meaningful to</text>
  <text start="1586.5" dur="5.7">sunshine and I the color of and the type</text>
  <text start="1589.95" dur="3.78">of stone that was so I mean that was</text>
  <text start="1592.2" dur="3.36">just one of those ways in which God is</text>
  <text start="1593.73" dur="3.54">saying you know I love you I care about</text>
  <text start="1595.56" dur="3.27">you the things that are important to you</text>
  <text start="1597.27" dur="2.97">are important to me I know I was telling</text>
  <text start="1598.83" dur="4.95">you last night about my granddaughter</text>
  <text start="1600.24" dur="5.82">she again she&amp;#39;s seen thousands of these</text>
  <text start="1603.78" dur="4.38">things appear and she was like god I</text>
  <text start="1606.06" dur="3.63">want a big rainbow colored stone and she</text>
  <text start="1608.16" dur="3.749">was actually kind of upset because she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1609.69" dur="3.599">like I don&amp;#39;t understand why and she said</text>
  <text start="1611.909" dur="3">she&amp;#39;s gonna understand why God won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1613.289" dur="3.09">give me a rainbow-colored don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1614.909" dur="4.05">them asking like I&amp;#39;m she was in tears</text>
  <text start="1616.379" dur="5.01">practically no I have to ask you</text>
  <text start="1618.959" dur="4.5">something now you talk about a rainbow</text>
  <text start="1621.389" dur="3.06">colored stone and I was asking you about</text>
  <text start="1623.459" dur="2.85">this last night</text>
  <text start="1624.449" dur="4.35">miss it are you talking about a stone</text>
  <text start="1626.309" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s actually different colors in the</text>
  <text start="1628.799" dur="4.25">same stone and you said that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1631.619" dur="4.35">actually had stones show they&amp;#39;re like</text>
  <text start="1633.049" dur="4.33">blue and they have like vine to me</text>
  <text start="1635.969" dur="2.82">milady there&amp;#39;s four different ways that</text>
  <text start="1637.379" dur="4.11">they can show up that there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1638.789" dur="4.71">different lines in stone that are</text>
  <text start="1641.489" dur="3.42">different colors and these are usually</text>
  <text start="1643.499" dur="3.3">bigger stones so you can actually pretty</text>
  <text start="1644.909" dur="4.32">clearly see the different colors right</text>
  <text start="1646.799" dur="3.72">there is a kind of stone a mystic fire</text>
  <text start="1649.229" dur="2.91">topaz I actually have the earring you</text>
  <text start="1650.519" dur="2.88">see has like three different colors</text>
  <text start="1652.139" dur="3.45">inside the stone that kind of all mixed</text>
  <text start="1653.399" dur="3.99">together okay so there are some stones</text>
  <text start="1655.589" dur="4.08">that will appear that that naturally</text>
  <text start="1657.389" dur="3.45">appear that way too but these particular</text>
  <text start="1659.669" dur="2.73">ones that are multicolored different</text>
  <text start="1660.839" dur="2.49">lines I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1662.399" dur="3.48">happen in nature</text>
  <text start="1663.329" dur="3.9">and if there are they have to they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1665.879" dur="3.78">really rare because you have to have</text>
  <text start="1667.229" dur="4.38">like very specific mineral deposits that</text>
  <text start="1669.659" dur="4.41">are like right next to each other not</text>
  <text start="1671.609" dur="3.99">mix with each other we&amp;#39;ve had a couple a</text>
  <text start="1674.069" dur="2.79">couple different stones and I think they</text>
  <text start="1675.599" dur="2.82">might have been opals or something show</text>
  <text start="1676.859" dur="3.48">up before the head streaks ago they</text>
  <text start="1678.419" dur="3.36">almost looked like pieces of straw in</text>
  <text start="1680.339" dur="3.45">the side the stone yeah but they have</text>
  <text start="1681.779" dur="3.96">speaks he called them - yeah so your</text>
  <text start="1683.789" dur="4.41">granddaughter is whining about not</text>
  <text start="1685.739" dur="4.951">having the rainbow colored stone yeah at</text>
  <text start="1688.199" dur="4.08">anything it sounds I know that probably</text>
  <text start="1690.69" dur="5.069">the listeners or whatever that sounds</text>
  <text start="1692.279" dur="4.95">really picky or disingenuous or social</text>
  <text start="1695.759" dur="3.09">in the seven-year-old well she&amp;#39;s seven</text>
  <text start="1697.229" dur="4.08">but again you have to understand she has</text>
  <text start="1698.849" dur="5.31">seen big stones I mean we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1701.309" dur="6.87">like a nickel or larger that are just</text>
  <text start="1704.159" dur="6.39">really neat shapes sizes colors appeared</text>
  <text start="1708.179" dur="5.22">in settings I mean she&amp;#39;s seen a really</text>
  <text start="1710.549" dur="4.35">broad range of really unique stones all</text>
  <text start="1713.399" dur="3.78">of which have appeared from heaven so</text>
  <text start="1714.899" dur="3.96">when she&amp;#39;s saying I don&amp;#39;t understand why</text>
  <text start="1717.179" dur="3.87">God won&amp;#39;t give me if she&amp;#39;s thinking God</text>
  <text start="1718.859" dur="4.081">can do anything he wants why doesn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="1721.049" dur="4.38">do this for me cuz I want it and he</text>
  <text start="1722.94" dur="3.839">likes me right you know so I actually</text>
  <text start="1725.429" dur="2.82">just a down with her for a little while</text>
  <text start="1726.779" dur="4.14">and just kind of talk to her and kind of</text>
  <text start="1728.249" dur="4.23">get her to refocus and just focus more</text>
  <text start="1730.919" dur="3.33">on being grateful for what God is doing</text>
  <text start="1732.479" dur="3.42">and explain that I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1734.249" dur="3.75">understand why God doesn&amp;#39;t always do the</text>
  <text start="1735.899" dur="4.77">things that we don&amp;#39;t I mean that we ask</text>
  <text start="1737.999" dur="5.371">him but that doesn&amp;#39;t change that he</text>
  <text start="1740.669" dur="4.711">likes us and loves us and that is</text>
  <text start="1743.37" dur="3.99">change that we can still be thankful for</text>
  <text start="1745.38" dur="3.21">the things he is doing well okay so 20</text>
  <text start="1747.36" dur="3.33">minutes after I had this conversation</text>
  <text start="1748.59" dur="5.4">with her she comes running out of her</text>
  <text start="1750.69" dur="6.09">room she is holding this large clear</text>
  <text start="1753.99" dur="5.13">stone and she&amp;#39;s like God gave me a big</text>
  <text start="1756.78" dur="4.14">lot she was like thrilled so I hold it</text>
  <text start="1759.12" dur="3.39">up to the sunlight and it&amp;#39;s shooting</text>
  <text start="1760.92" dur="4.53">rainbows on the wall so it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="1762.51" dur="4.62">prison basically so I mean God didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1765.45" dur="3.57">give her a one that was rainbow colored</text>
  <text start="1767.13" dur="3.66">but it made rainbow colors so he</text>
  <text start="1769.02" dur="4.59">basically gave her what she wanted which</text>
  <text start="1770.79" dur="3.66">is a large rainbows don&amp;#39;t break right</text>
  <text start="1773.61" dur="2.79">that&amp;#39;s cool</text>
  <text start="1774.45" dur="4.41">once again evidence that God doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1776.4" dur="4.5">necessarily answer your prayers what you</text>
  <text start="1778.86" dur="5.1">think he&amp;#39;s going to but he will answer</text>
  <text start="1780.9" dur="5.64">them according to his way that he feels</text>
  <text start="1783.96" dur="4.17">you should have your appearance yet and</text>
  <text start="1786.54" dur="3.269">so what to is I mean but the fact he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1788.13" dur="3.44">happy to answer in prayers like that I</text>
  <text start="1789.809" dur="5.221">mean I don&amp;#39;t know what it was that</text>
  <text start="1791.57" dur="5.44">caused him to send a stone after we</text>
  <text start="1795.03" dur="3.6">talked as compared to before we talked</text>
  <text start="1797.01" dur="3.36">me he was just something he wanted her</text>
  <text start="1798.63" dur="4.5">to have a perspective shift before I</text>
  <text start="1800.37" dur="5.58">have no idea I think he wanted you to</text>
  <text start="1803.13" dur="4.53">correct her theology and correct her</text>
  <text start="1805.95" dur="3.57">understanding and maybe point out look</text>
  <text start="1807.66" dur="3.48">this is an issue of gratitude</text>
  <text start="1809.52" dur="3.69">I&amp;#39;ll being thankful for what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1811.14" dur="4.44">already done and not being a spoiled</text>
  <text start="1813.21" dur="3.36">brat and you know how do you temper</text>
  <text start="1815.58" dur="3.21">casual because you don&amp;#39;t get what you</text>
  <text start="1816.57" dur="3.359">want yeah yeah I mean I honestly think</text>
  <text start="1818.79" dur="2.4">that could easily be part of it and</text>
  <text start="1819.929" dur="2.791">that&amp;#39;s kind of a lesson for all of us</text>
  <text start="1821.19" dur="3.9">because I mean I&amp;#39;ve had times like that</text>
  <text start="1822.72" dur="5.7">to where I&amp;#39;ve had to say okay God like</text>
  <text start="1825.09" dur="5.28">I&amp;#39;m upset because but at the same time I</text>
  <text start="1828.42" dur="3.99">really need to remind myself you know</text>
  <text start="1830.37" dur="4.32">what like there&amp;#39;s lots of people who</text>
  <text start="1832.41" dur="3.899">would love to have this happen and I</text>
  <text start="1834.69" dur="3.6">really need to be in a position of being</text>
  <text start="1836.309" dur="3.691">thankful for what God&amp;#39;s doing and not</text>
  <text start="1838.29" dur="2.76">just upset about what he&amp;#39;s not doing cuz</text>
  <text start="1840" dur="3.12">really let&amp;#39;s be honest with ourselves</text>
  <text start="1841.05" dur="4.05">where they&amp;#39;re talking about gems healing</text>
  <text start="1843.12" dur="4.16">doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference of what the</text>
  <text start="1845.1" dur="4.17">subject is simple answered prayers</text>
  <text start="1847.28" dur="3.76">spending your time upset about what God</text>
  <text start="1849.27" dur="3.09">isn&amp;#39;t doing I don&amp;#39;t think has ever been</text>
  <text start="1851.04" dur="2.49">real effective in getting your prayer</text>
  <text start="1852.36" dur="2.67">answered no probably not</text>
  <text start="1853.53" dur="3.06">so I want to get into some of the</text>
  <text start="1855.03" dur="3.72">questions that people are obviously</text>
  <text start="1856.59" dur="4.44">going to want to ask you about these</text>
  <text start="1858.75" dur="7.74">gemstones have you ever had any of them</text>
  <text start="1861.03" dur="6.779">analyzed by a gemologist to discern what</text>
  <text start="1866.49" dur="1.86">they&amp;#39;re actually made of what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1867.809" dur="3.691">worth</text>
  <text start="1868.35" dur="4.68">so I haven&amp;#39;t personally and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1871.5" dur="4.27">reasons behind that one being that it</text>
  <text start="1873.03" dur="4.12">can be really expensive to do that and I</text>
  <text start="1875.77" dur="3.18">seen them up here so for me I almost</text>
  <text start="1877.15" dur="3.33">don&amp;#39;t care what they&amp;#39;re made of and</text>
  <text start="1878.95" dur="3.18">different people have different views on</text>
  <text start="1880.48" dur="3.24">that I mean I just it doesn&amp;#39;t matter to</text>
  <text start="1882.13" dur="4.02">me what they&amp;#39;re made of because I</text>
  <text start="1883.72" dur="3.66">watched them appear out of heaven like I</text>
  <text start="1886.15" dur="2.19">just I know they&amp;#39;re from God so who</text>
  <text start="1887.38" dur="2.79">cares what they&amp;#39;re made out of they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1888.34" dur="4.95">really pretty and they&amp;#39;re really sparkly</text>
  <text start="1890.17" dur="5.46">and I like them but but I do know other</text>
  <text start="1893.29" dur="5.13">people who have had and analyzed what</text>
  <text start="1895.63" dur="4.5">they find totally varies sometimes</text>
  <text start="1898.42" dur="3.6">they&amp;#39;ll find hey I can&amp;#39;t tell you what</text>
  <text start="1900.13" dur="4.62">this is made of it&amp;#39;s not a substance</text>
  <text start="1902.02" dur="4.35">that I were familiar with other times</text>
  <text start="1904.75" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;ve had things like oh this is glass</text>
  <text start="1906.37" dur="7.25">this is plastic and to the point where</text>
  <text start="1909.01" dur="7.08">sometimes it seems like what the person</text>
  <text start="1913.62" dur="4.96">analyzes the stone as being like is</text>
  <text start="1916.09" dur="5.22">dependent on what the person who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1918.58" dur="6.33">bringing the stone in believes about the</text>
  <text start="1921.31" dur="6.63">stone - people brought the same stone to</text>
  <text start="1924.91" dur="5.43">the same jeweler gemologist person and</text>
  <text start="1927.94" dur="3.75">analyzed the same stone without knowing</text>
  <text start="1930.34" dur="3.27">it was the same stone it came up with</text>
  <text start="1931.69" dur="4.11">two completely different substances that</text>
  <text start="1933.61" dur="5.31">it was made out of you know how Jesus</text>
  <text start="1935.8" dur="5.25">said to people be it with you according</text>
  <text start="1938.92" dur="4.2">to your faith yeah he would go up to the</text>
  <text start="1941.05" dur="4.8">blind person and say what do you want</text>
  <text start="1943.12" dur="4.53">for me now if I was the blind person I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1945.85" dur="5.25">be thinking well I&amp;#39;m blind what do you</text>
  <text start="1947.65" dur="5.52">think I want I want to see but Jesus</text>
  <text start="1951.1" dur="5.42">would frequently ask people what do you</text>
  <text start="1953.17" dur="6.12">want and he would require them to</text>
  <text start="1956.52" dur="4.69">articulate what they expected what they</text>
  <text start="1959.29" dur="4.05">wanted what they desired and he would</text>
  <text start="1961.21" dur="4.89">meet their expectations their desires</text>
  <text start="1963.34" dur="4.92">and get to them according to what they</text>
  <text start="1966.1" dur="4.47">expected or desired not usually a lot</text>
  <text start="1968.26" dur="4.86">more and certainly nothing less but I</text>
  <text start="1970.57" dur="4.83">think that principle runs through a lot</text>
  <text start="1973.12" dur="4.59">of things in the kingdom a lot of times</text>
  <text start="1975.4" dur="4.71">what manifests in our life is a result</text>
  <text start="1977.71" dur="4.08">of what we expect what we believe for</text>
  <text start="1980.11" dur="4.05">and what we&amp;#39;re anticipating that God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1981.79" dur="4.98">going to do so if you expect or believe</text>
  <text start="1984.16" dur="4.53">and you may be doubting and skeptical of</text>
  <text start="1986.77" dur="3.33">these are actually worth anything you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1988.69" dur="2.91">going to the gemologist and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1990.1" dur="3.06">gonna say well these have you made of</text>
  <text start="1991.6" dur="3.21">glass pretty much they&amp;#39;re not worth</text>
  <text start="1993.16" dur="3.27">anything congratulations what they say</text>
  <text start="1994.81" dur="4.14">right but the same person goes in and</text>
  <text start="1996.43" dur="4.2">says they&amp;#39;re having this expectation in</text>
  <text start="1998.95" dur="4.47">their heart that God has given them a</text>
  <text start="2000.63" dur="3.21">truly valuable sapphire or diamond to</text>
  <text start="2003.42" dur="1.86">Ruby</text>
  <text start="2003.84" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;re gonna go in it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="2005.28" dur="3.15">inspecting they&amp;#39;re saying well this is</text>
  <text start="2007.05" dur="2.58">actually a really high quality stone</text>
  <text start="2008.43" dur="2.94">it&amp;#39;s worth like money</text>
  <text start="2009.63" dur="3.51">yeah and that and that it can happen</text>
  <text start="2011.37" dur="3.39">like I said I&amp;#39;ve not had them tested I</text>
  <text start="2013.14" dur="3.66">bought a diamond tester a couple months</text>
  <text start="2014.76" dur="3.9">back and most of the clear stones we</text>
  <text start="2016.8" dur="3.57">have don&amp;#39;t test his diamonds and it</text>
  <text start="2018.66" dur="4.53">literally tests diamond not diamond</text>
  <text start="2020.37" dur="4.5">which tells me they&amp;#39;re probably topaz or</text>
  <text start="2023.19" dur="3.81">some other stone it doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2024.87" dur="3.66">not valuable it just means that at this</text>
  <text start="2027" dur="2.76">point in time I&amp;#39;m not really willing to</text>
  <text start="2028.53" dur="3.12">try and put the effort and energy to</text>
  <text start="2029.76" dur="4.8">figure out what they&amp;#39;re worth and I</text>
  <text start="2031.65" dur="4.98">think that in order to try and do</text>
  <text start="2034.56" dur="5.1">something like selling them you have to</text>
  <text start="2036.63" dur="4.38">either have easy access to 72 gemologist</text>
  <text start="2039.66" dur="5.49">have a lot of money are willing to spend</text>
  <text start="2041.01" dur="5.67">on it or know somebody who basically can</text>
  <text start="2045.15" dur="4.11">kind of simplify that process for you</text>
  <text start="2046.68" dur="3.989">but I mean I think I think if if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2049.26" dur="3.27">got stones that God&amp;#39;s given you and you</text>
  <text start="2050.669" dur="4.381">want to try and sell them I mean go for</text>

  <text start="2056.94" dur="5.939">like the open account works so the issue</text>
  <text start="2059.28" dur="5.34">of selling stones now I can see a whole</text>
  <text start="2062.879" dur="4.411">bunch of red flags being thrown out</text>
  <text start="2064.62" dur="5.37">there in Christianity land people are</text>
  <text start="2067.29" dur="3.869">gonna say wait a minute first of all I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2069.99" dur="2.28">not sure I even believe in these stones</text>
  <text start="2071.159" dur="2.071">but are you telling me people are</text>
  <text start="2072.27" dur="3.48">actually thinking about selling</text>
  <text start="2073.23" dur="3.99">something that God gave them from a</text>
  <text start="2075.75" dur="2.73">stone from heaven how could you ever</text>
  <text start="2077.22" dur="2.52">think about selling what well I mean</text>
  <text start="2078.48" dur="3.06">let&amp;#39;s be honest this is like I said I</text>
  <text start="2079.74" dur="4.919">mean I have had probably I&amp;#39;ve probably</text>
  <text start="2081.54" dur="5.31">given away more stones of ones that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2084.659" dur="4.711">personally picked up then I actually</text>

  <text start="2089.37" dur="4.2">them I mean at some point in time what</text>
  <text start="2091.35" dur="3.84">do you do with all of them so I mean</text>
  <text start="2093.57" dur="3.51">I&amp;#39;ve given a lot of stones away to a lot</text>
  <text start="2095.19" dur="3.27">of different people and it&amp;#39;s not any</text>
  <text start="2097.08" dur="2.94">different if I sell them and make money</text>
  <text start="2098.46" dur="3">off of them and can do something</text>
  <text start="2100.02" dur="2.7">functional and useful with it versus</text>
  <text start="2101.46" dur="2.88">give it away if they&amp;#39;re still not</text>
  <text start="2102.72" dur="3.99">keeping the gift that God gave me so</text>
  <text start="2104.34" dur="4.02">anyway you swing it I&amp;#39;m not keeping the</text>
  <text start="2106.71" dur="4.38">gift I mean I have a lot of them that I</text>
  <text start="2108.36" dur="4.68">have kept but at the same time - I mean</text>
  <text start="2111.09" dur="5.4">you were you were telling me in this</text>

  <text start="2116.49" dur="5.46">was like hey Jesus we got to go pay this</text>
  <text start="2119.07" dur="3.33">temple tax he&amp;#39;s like okay so go down to</text>

  <text start="2126.12" dur="3.51">mouth take the coin I mean can you</text>
  <text start="2127.86" dur="3.68">matter imagine Peter coming back and</text>
  <text start="2129.63" dur="5.1">being like hey Jesus I found this coin</text>
  <text start="2131.54" dur="4.81">I&amp;#39;m gonna hold on to it and memorialize</text>
  <text start="2134.73" dur="3.96">it I&amp;#39;m gonna laminate it and I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>

  <text start="2140.22" dur="5.91">forehead okay facepalm time or haste</text>
  <text start="2142.09" dur="6.6">like Peter could you go pay the tax now</text>
  <text start="2146.13" dur="4.51">so some people have this idea of God</text>
  <text start="2148.69" dur="3.51">that God is not practical the guy</text>
  <text start="2150.64" dur="3.72">doesn&amp;#39;t care about our finances the guy</text>
  <text start="2152.2" dur="4.26">doesn&amp;#39;t care about taking heavenly gifts</text>
  <text start="2154.36" dur="4.05">and converting them to cash and paying</text>
  <text start="2156.46" dur="3.18">our bills or paying our taxes I mean</text>
  <text start="2158.41" dur="3.12">something don&amp;#39;t have a grid of</text>
  <text start="2159.64" dur="4.53">understanding for that that&amp;#39;s incredibly</text>
  <text start="2161.53" dur="3.93">practical I I think he is incredibly</text>
  <text start="2164.17" dur="3.87">sentimental he&amp;#39;s the biggest</text>
  <text start="2165.46" dur="4.8">sentimentalist in the universe he&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="2168.04" dur="4.61">the most practical being in the universe</text>
  <text start="2170.26" dur="4.59">he cares about our practical needs I</text>
  <text start="2172.65" dur="4.6">understand the idea that if you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="2174.85" dur="4.53">one of those people who is so in love so</text>
  <text start="2177.25" dur="4.17">enraptured the awesome love of the</text>
  <text start="2179.38" dur="4.68">father and you could never think about</text>
  <text start="2181.42" dur="4.92">selling a gemstone or anything that</text>
  <text start="2184.06" dur="4.35">appeared from heaven supernaturally I</text>
  <text start="2186.34" dur="4.35">get that that&amp;#39;s cool don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t sell</text>
  <text start="2188.41" dur="4.71">anything but when I went to the Healing</text>
  <text start="2190.69" dur="5.97">Rooms annual spiritual hunger conference</text>
  <text start="2193.12" dur="6.18">in 2009 one of the keynote speakers was</text>
  <text start="2196.66" dur="5.01">a pastor from Tennessee who the Lord</text>
  <text start="2199.3" dur="3.81">said I want you to come to the</text>
  <text start="2201.67" dur="3.51">conference and I want you to testify</text>
  <text start="2203.11" dur="3.93">about what I&amp;#39;ve been doing in your life</text>
  <text start="2205.18" dur="3.36">and the pastor said well Lord I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2207.04" dur="4.11">have any money I can&amp;#39;t even buy the</text>
  <text start="2208.54" dur="4.89">plane ticket to go to Spokane so the</text>
  <text start="2211.15" dur="5.55">Lord sent an angel who appeared in his</text>
  <text start="2213.43" dur="6.51">bedroom dropped a gold coin his floor</text>
  <text start="2216.7" dur="5.04">and said take that gold coin go cash it</text>
  <text start="2219.94" dur="3.36">in and buy your plane ticket well this</text>
  <text start="2221.74" dur="3.81">the same kind of thing I mean it God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2223.3" dur="4.29">really practical you know gold I think</text>
  <text start="2225.55" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s going for what like 11 or two</text>
  <text start="2227.59" dur="3.06">hundred dollars in 30 okay yes you have</text>
  <text start="2229.39" dur="4.53">like twelve fifteen hundred dollars now</text>
  <text start="2230.65" dur="4.77">so I mean so an ounce of gold will take</text>
  <text start="2233.92" dur="4.02">care of that plane ticket quite easily</text>
  <text start="2235.42" dur="4.56">hey boys all the company on his food and</text>
  <text start="2237.94" dur="4.8">see that&amp;#39;s the thing some people would</text>
  <text start="2239.98" dur="4.98">say if it angel appeared or didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2242.74" dur="3.62">appear but the gold coin showed up a lot</text>
  <text start="2244.96" dur="3.96">of people would be tempted to say oh</text>
  <text start="2246.36" dur="4.9">that&amp;#39;s really cool I&amp;#39;m just gonna hang</text>
  <text start="2248.92" dur="4.56">onto that gold coin forever and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2251.26" dur="5.1">great memorial to testimony God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2253.48" dur="4.92">goodness other stuff great but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2256.36" dur="5.04">think the person who goes and sells that</text>
  <text start="2258.4" dur="4.5">coin to pay for a plane ticket to go to</text>
  <text start="2261.4" dur="3.72">a conference where they can testify but</text>
  <text start="2262.9" dur="4.5">the goodness of God should be criticized</text>
  <text start="2265.12" dur="5.04">and I think this issue with the</text>
  <text start="2267.4" dur="5.52">gemstones is I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think</text>
  <text start="2270.16" dur="4.89">it&amp;#39;s a bad idea to sell these stones if</text>
  <text start="2272.92" dur="2.699">you can and if you have a need and a</text>
  <text start="2275.05" dur="3.179">special</text>
  <text start="2275.619" dur="4.71">if God tells you look I gave you this</text>
  <text start="2278.229" dur="4.02">stone because you&amp;#39;ve been praying to me</text>
  <text start="2280.329" dur="3.18">for six months you don&amp;#39;t have a job and</text>
  <text start="2282.249" dur="2.07">you can&amp;#39;t pay your bills and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2283.509" dur="2.28">gonna get evicted</text>
  <text start="2284.319" dur="2.73">now I&amp;#39;m rating gemstones in your house</text>
  <text start="2285.789" dur="3.27">why don&amp;#39;t you take some of those stones</text>
  <text start="2287.049" dur="5.101">and go pay your bills yeah I mean it</text>
  <text start="2289.059" dur="4.861">seems extremely practical to me again as</text>
  <text start="2292.15" dur="4.139">long as you can make those other things</text>
  <text start="2293.92" dur="4.049">work out hey and I mean I&amp;#39;ve looked into</text>
  <text start="2296.289" dur="4.8">it which is you know obviously how I</text>
  <text start="2297.969" dur="5.971">know it is definitely possible to do and</text>
  <text start="2301.089" dur="4.14">I don&amp;#39;t see a reason not to again it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2303.94" dur="3.45">personal conviction thing though there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2305.229" dur="3.661">no right or wrong answer and I think</text>
  <text start="2307.39" dur="3.81">that&amp;#39;s what people need to remember is</text>
  <text start="2308.89" dur="4.379">that there really is no right or wrong</text>
  <text start="2311.2" dur="4.23">answer as far as stuff like that goes it</text>
  <text start="2313.269" dur="4.74">literally comes down to what you have in</text>
  <text start="2315.43" dur="4.47">your own heart it is possible for</text>
  <text start="2318.009" dur="4.86">somebody to get so incredibly greedy</text>
  <text start="2319.9" dur="6.54">that they basically turn the idea of</text>
  <text start="2322.869" dur="5.37">gemstones into a I know I&amp;#39;ll get around</text>
  <text start="2326.44" dur="3.21">people who have gemstones so I can make</text>
  <text start="2328.239" dur="3.27">tons of money and get rich well that</text>
  <text start="2329.65" dur="3.03">might not be the best hard attitude that</text>
  <text start="2331.509" dur="3.06">doesn&amp;#39;t mean God won&amp;#39;t give you</text>
  <text start="2332.68" dur="3.869">gemstones but I would suggest to you</text>
  <text start="2334.569" dur="4.831">that you still need to get your heart</text>
  <text start="2336.549" dur="4.02">attitude change but you can still be</text>
  <text start="2339.4" dur="2.969">appreciative and say you know what wow</text>
  <text start="2340.569" dur="3.091">I&amp;#39;ve got probably hundreds and thousands</text>
  <text start="2342.369" dur="3.031">of dollars worth of gemstones here I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2343.66" dur="3.659">feeling really blessed and thankful like</text>
  <text start="2345.4" dur="5.369">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that I turn</text>
  <text start="2347.319" dur="5.641">one stone into a pendant for my wife I</text>
  <text start="2350.769" dur="4.05">have one that I wear as a necklace</text>

  <text start="2365.92" dur="4.649">and all of the above and whatever it is</text>
  <text start="2368.17" dur="6.299">you choose to do is your right and it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2501.25" dur="3.51">well since I handed her a gemstone I</text>
  <text start="2503.17" dur="3.63">mean like Jesus we could have been</text>
  <text start="2504.76" dur="4.02">ordered to go that seems unrelated on</text>
  <text start="2506.8" dur="3.51">the one hand but she&amp;#39;s making a</text>
  <text start="2508.78" dur="3.21">correlation whether it&amp;#39;s related or not</text>
  <text start="2510.31" dur="3.51">so I mean I don&amp;#39;t care whether giving</text>
  <text start="2511.99" dur="3.63">the stone had that effect or not but</text>
  <text start="2513.82" dur="3.09">she&amp;#39;s making that correlation and is</text>
  <text start="2515.62" dur="3.72">seeing the love of God in and through</text>
  <text start="2516.91" dur="4.89">that and that&amp;#39;s cool and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2519.34" dur="6.51">every manifestation is about whether</text>
  <text start="2521.8" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s healing or prophecy or gemstones</text>
  <text start="2525.85" dur="4.86">everything is always pointing people to</text>
  <text start="2528.25" dur="5.34">the love of the father yeah I mean I</text>
  <text start="2530.71" dur="5.88">think it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s very difficult to live</text>
  <text start="2533.59" dur="3.96">a spiritual life and enjoy your life</text>
  <text start="2536.59" dur="3.27">without</text>
  <text start="2537.55" dur="4.26">having a perspective of God loving and</text>
  <text start="2539.86" dur="3.51">being in love with you there&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="2541.81" dur="3.6">different perspectives about who this</text>
  <text start="2543.37" dur="4.29">God in the Bible is like and I think any</text>
  <text start="2545.41" dur="3.63">one of them and it doesn&amp;#39;t include God</text>
  <text start="2547.66" dur="3.21">is the most loving being in the world</text>
  <text start="2549.04" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re really missing something yeah</text>
  <text start="2550.87" dur="4.62">because why else would God choose to</text>
  <text start="2553.15" dur="4.29">create beings to love other than to love</text>
  <text start="2555.49" dur="6.09">them really God created us out of a</text>
  <text start="2557.44" dur="5.64">desire for love to love us and for us to</text>
  <text start="2561.58" dur="3.21">love him back so I mean it&amp;#39;s really just</text>
  <text start="2563.08" dur="3.51">a and that&amp;#39;s really what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="2564.79" dur="4.92">so anything that God&amp;#39;s doing in our</text>
  <text start="2566.59" dur="5.85">lives whether it&amp;#39;s something like gems</text>
  <text start="2569.71" dur="4.71">or oil or feathers or whatever a healing</text>
  <text start="2572.44" dur="4.47">healing is possibly one of the biggest</text>
  <text start="2574.42" dur="5.1">physical manifestations of God&amp;#39;s love</text>
  <text start="2576.91" dur="5.07">that I&amp;#39;ve ever seen I which is why I</text>
  <text start="2579.52" dur="4.65">hammer the sub-q field yes are often is</text>
  <text start="2581.98" dur="4.35">because there&amp;#39;s so many sick people who</text>
  <text start="2584.17" dur="4.53">are hurting when you release healing</text>
  <text start="2586.33" dur="5.64">into that person&amp;#39;s life it is an</text>
  <text start="2588.7" dur="6.06">absolutely tangible unmistakable</text>
  <text start="2591.97" dur="6.21">personal testimony that they have that</text>
  <text start="2594.76" dur="4.89">says forever God loves me yeah it&amp;#39;s true</text>
  <text start="2598.18" dur="5.37">I mean so and I think it all comes down</text>
  <text start="2599.65" dur="5.1">to gems or manifestations love foil is a</text>
  <text start="2603.55" dur="3.09">manifestation of love and jelly</text>
  <text start="2604.75" dur="4.2">visitations prophetic words healing</text>
  <text start="2606.64" dur="4.68">their manifestations of God&amp;#39;s love first</text>
  <text start="2608.95" dur="3.87">and so I think even outside of some of</text>
  <text start="2611.32" dur="3.33">the questions about gems</text>
  <text start="2612.82" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;ve been broaden that out about what</text>
  <text start="2614.65" dur="2.73">is God saying and doing there&amp;#39;s a number</text>
  <text start="2616.3" dur="2.94">of different things he&amp;#39;s saying and</text>
  <text start="2617.38" dur="3.6">doing and I&amp;#39;m gonna cover that more in</text>
  <text start="2619.24" dur="3.51">the book but if you had to break it down</text>
  <text start="2620.98" dur="3.78">into a single word it definitely comes</text>
  <text start="2622.75" dur="3.66">down to love that&amp;#39;s cool well I think</text>
