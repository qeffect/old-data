  <text start="173.1" dur="8.04">book that I published back in he</text>
  <text start="176.07" dur="8.79">actually publishes at the end of 2012</text>
  <text start="181.14" dur="8.099">and we didn&amp;#39;t actually start selling it</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="8.82">until 2013 January 2013 it is the first</text>
  <text start="189.239" dur="7.351">of 12 books that I&amp;#39;ve published and it</text>
  <text start="193.68" dur="5.339">is probably arguably the most popular</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="3.81">books in it that we published people</text>
  <text start="199.019" dur="3.091">really seem to like the book they enjoy</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="5.13">a lot and a lot of really amazing</text>
  <text start="202.11" dur="5.07">testimonies from people who have learned</text>
  <text start="205.53" dur="2.97">a lot from the book learn about God</text>
  <text start="207.18" dur="5.779">learned about the kingdom learned about</text>
  <text start="208.5" dur="9.269">healing and I go in in depth in the book</text>
  <text start="212.959" dur="6.701">into the the basics of healing the</text>
  <text start="217.769" dur="4.741">identity of God the identity of</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="4.77">believers things like power and</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="4.05">authority and how you release power and</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="4.71">how you exercise authority to get people</text>
  <text start="226.56" dur="4.53">healed we talk about deliverance I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="229.14" dur="4.11">covered all these chapters we&amp;#39;re now in</text>
  <text start="231.09" dur="7.17">chapter 27 which is the second last</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="9.209">chapter in the book and we are now</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="6.75">getting to a place where we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="8.131">talk about the future of healing alright</text>
  <text start="245.01" dur="7.71">now I have had hundreds and prep that</text>
  <text start="250.59" dur="8.07">probably honestly probably over 400 or</text>
  <text start="252.72" dur="8.759">500 dreams about healing since 2008 God</text>
  <text start="258.66" dur="5.14">talks to me a lot through dreams and he</text>
  <text start="261.479" dur="4.481">has had a lot to say about healing</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="5.16">I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot about healing because</text>
  <text start="265.96" dur="4.799">well I used to be an atheist and did not</text>
  <text start="268.96" dur="2.519">not only did I not know about healing I</text>
  <text start="270.759" dur="2.331">didn&amp;#39;t know anything about the</text>
  <text start="271.479" dur="5.131">supernatural and I didn&amp;#39;t believe in God</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="6.579">so he had to teach me quite a bit need</text>
  <text start="276.61" dur="4.32">to teach me everything and it is good</text>
  <text start="279.669" dur="3.84">you can learn a lot from the Scriptures</text>
  <text start="280.93" dur="5.639">but there is nothing like learning from</text>
  <text start="283.509" dur="4.801">the Holy Spirit he can personalize a</text>
  <text start="286.569" dur="3.901">lesson for you and teach you</text>
  <text start="288.31" dur="5.13">specifically things that you need to</text>
  <text start="290.47" dur="5.37">know so I have been a student in the</text>
  <text start="293.44" dur="8.159">Holy Spirit high school hey Susan</text>
  <text start="295.84" dur="8.28">Melanie storm is on here hey Susan the</text>
  <text start="301.599" dur="5.581">novel is coming out soon that I think</text>
  <text start="304.12" dur="4.259">you may be interested in reading we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="307.18" dur="5.579">talk about that at the end of the</text>
  <text start="308.379" dur="7.771">broadcast all right</text>
  <text start="312.759" dur="5.13">so God speaks to me a lot through dreams</text>
  <text start="316.15" dur="4.47">and he&amp;#39;s give me a lot of revelation</text>
  <text start="317.889" dur="5.671">about healing and deliverance and</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="4.74">emotional healing we&amp;#39;ve covered those in</text>
  <text start="323.56" dur="3.599">previous chapters in previous broadcast</text>
  <text start="325.36" dur="7.739">so now we&amp;#39;re going to talk about the</text>
  <text start="327.159" dur="7.35">future feeling and in this broadcast I</text>
  <text start="333.099" dur="2.671">want to talk about two dreams that I had</text>
  <text start="334.509" dur="3.301">and they&amp;#39;re there but I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="3.899">read one of the dreams right from the</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="4.889">book because I don&amp;#39;t want to make a</text>
  <text start="339.669" dur="8.641">mistake in this court myself I&amp;#39;m June</text>
  <text start="342.699" dur="9.301">8th 2010 all right so 9 years ago I had</text>
  <text start="348.31" dur="6.03">a dream that contained two scenes in the</text>
  <text start="352" dur="6.449">first scene I watched a presentation in</text>
  <text start="354.34" dur="8.46">which a new kind of airplane module was</text>
  <text start="358.449" dur="7.141">being demonstrated in which a new kind</text>
  <text start="362.8" dur="5.85">of that&amp;#39;s alright and it was built the</text>
  <text start="365.59" dur="6.12">module was built using advanced</text>
  <text start="368.65" dur="7.919">technology the module was designed to</text>
  <text start="371.71" dur="7.799">withstand any type of crash it was it</text>
  <text start="376.569" dur="5.34">held a small crew of no more than five</text>
  <text start="379.509" dur="5.041">people the crew that would occupy the</text>
  <text start="381.909" dur="6.12">module receive diverse and specialized</text>
  <text start="384.55" dur="8.039">training but their primary function was</text>
  <text start="388.029" dur="8.901">as a medical team they were given</text>
  <text start="392.589" dur="6.8">advanced equipment to use</text>
  <text start="396.93" dur="5.37">for their mission the module was going</text>
  <text start="399.389" dur="7.981">to be retrofitted unto all passenger</text>
  <text start="402.3" dur="8.459">airlines in the dream it was known was a</text>
  <text start="407.37" dur="5.01">well-known fact that airliners would be</text>
  <text start="410.759" dur="6.211">crashing in the future</text>
  <text start="412.38" dur="6.87">the retrofit of the module was done to</text>
  <text start="416.97" dur="6.9">ensure the survival of a handful of</text>
  <text start="419.25" dur="7.05">people when the airplanes crashed once</text>
  <text start="423.87" dur="5.16">an airplane crashed the module would</text>
  <text start="426.3" dur="5.339">separate from it from the fuselage that</text>
  <text start="429.03" dur="4.74">would open the crew would be unharmed by</text>
  <text start="431.639" dur="4.051">the impact and they would get out of the</text>
  <text start="433.77" dur="4.8">module and they would survive wherever</text>
  <text start="435.69" dur="5.759">they were part of the demonstration that</text>
  <text start="438.57" dur="4.8">I watched was in the dream explained the</text>
  <text start="441.449" dur="4.771">training that the crew went through</text>
  <text start="443.37" dur="5.37">which allowed them to survive even in</text>
  <text start="446.22" dur="4.169">the most hostile environment it was</text>
  <text start="448.74" dur="6.929">known to everyone that the airplanes</text>
  <text start="450.389" dur="6.541">would crash in hostile territory this</text>
  <text start="455.669" dur="4.56">was the end of the first part of the</text>
  <text start="456.93" dur="5.37">dream in the second part I watched the</text>
  <text start="460.229" dur="3.961">technology for the new module being</text>
  <text start="462.3" dur="3.839">developed it was a very technical dream</text>
  <text start="464.19" dur="3.21">and it was kind of a conceptual dream</text>
  <text start="466.139" dur="4.101">and I don&amp;#39;t really remember the details</text>
  <text start="467.4" dur="6.72">of it and that was the end of that tree</text>
  <text start="470.24" dur="5.049">so commercial airliners in dreams that</text>
  <text start="474.12" dur="2.519">when you&amp;#39;re going to interpret a dream</text>
  <text start="475.289" dur="2.91">the first thing you need to do is</text>
  <text start="476.639" dur="5.071">interpret whether it is literal or</text>
  <text start="478.199" dur="6.631">symbolic and I have a lot of literal</text>
  <text start="481.71" dur="5.76">dreams but I also have quite a few</text>
  <text start="484.83" dur="4.35">symbolic dreams in this one what I look</text>
  <text start="487.47" dur="4.05">at to determine if it&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="489.18" dur="5.64">literal or symbolic is if there is</text>
  <text start="491.52" dur="6.36">anything in the dream that cannot be</text>
  <text start="494.82" dur="5.37">taken literally the entire dream is</text>
  <text start="497.88" dur="5.819">probably symbolic and this is a</text>
  <text start="500.19" dur="5.18">principle that I&amp;#39;ve learned from reading</text>
  <text start="503.699" dur="6.511">books on dream interpretation</text>
  <text start="505.37" dur="6.87">particularly oh honey what&amp;#39;s that guy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="510.21" dur="2.03">name</text>
  <text start="513.68" dur="5.08">our Milligan&amp;#39;s book understanding that</text>
  <text start="516.839" dur="4.021">dreams you dream he talks quite a bit</text>
  <text start="518.76" dur="4.62">about how to interpret dreams literal</text>
  <text start="520.86" dur="7.919">versus symbolic so this is obviously</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="8.819">symbolic dream not a literal one and</text>
  <text start="528.779" dur="6.571">so airplanes and airliners commercial</text>
  <text start="532.199" dur="7.531">airliners tend to represent large groups</text>
  <text start="535.35" dur="6.33">of people in society sometimes a large</text>
  <text start="539.73" dur="4.32">airliner will represent the church the</text>
  <text start="541.68" dur="3.75">body of church believers all right now</text>
  <text start="544.05" dur="4.38">you can interpret the dream one of two</text>
  <text start="545.43" dur="5.069">ways you can interpret it as speaking to</text>
  <text start="548.43" dur="3.149">society at large or the church at large</text>
  <text start="550.499" dur="7.38">either either one</text>
  <text start="551.579" dur="10.081">maybe both but crashes tend to happen</text>
  <text start="557.879" dur="7.95">suddenly and they talk about sudden</text>
  <text start="561.66" dur="5.489">changes now in this dream we knew that</text>
  <text start="565.829" dur="5.641">all the airliners were going to be</text>
  <text start="567.149" dur="6.63">crashing in the future and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="571.47" dur="4.049">all crash at the same time they crashed</text>
  <text start="573.779" dur="5.16">they were going to be crashing over a</text>
  <text start="575.519" dur="6.601">period of time they would be crashing in</text>
  <text start="578.939" dur="5.671">hostile locations and there would be a</text>
  <text start="582.12" dur="7.43">crew that was trained and equipped and</text>
  <text start="584.61" dur="7.079">prepared to survive impact right so</text>
  <text start="589.55" dur="7.509">symbolically working away through the</text>
  <text start="591.689" dur="10.351">dream it seems to portray a future event</text>
  <text start="597.059" dur="7.02">where there going to be some significant</text>
  <text start="602.04" dur="7.26">changes to either the church or society</text>
  <text start="604.079" dur="9.69">at large where a number of people will</text>
  <text start="609.3" dur="7.17">be hurt or damaged or their ability to</text>
  <text start="613.769" dur="4.231">survive will be compromised but some</text>
  <text start="616.47" dur="7.2">people will be trained it in advance</text>
  <text start="618" dur="8.639">ready to deal with that situation and in</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="6.81">the dream although they had a diversity</text>
  <text start="626.639" dur="7.14">of training their primary goal was the</text>
  <text start="630.48" dur="4.979">study of medicine now again if the dream</text>
  <text start="633.779" dur="3.6">is symbolic and I have a lot of dreams</text>
  <text start="635.459" dur="3.391">about healing I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s likely</text>
  <text start="637.379" dur="4.171">that the dream is literally talking</text>
  <text start="638.85" dur="5.149">about medicine medicine symbolically</text>
  <text start="641.55" dur="8.399">speaks of healing divine healing right</text>
  <text start="643.999" dur="10.291">so this dream I think was a portrayal of</text>
  <text start="649.949" dur="7.44">a coming event or a series of events</text>
  <text start="654.29" dur="4.75">after which it would be coming very</text>
  <text start="657.389" dur="3.75">important for us to learn about healing</text>
  <text start="659.04" dur="3.13">now I don&amp;#39;t know if this speaks about a</text>
  <text start="661.139" dur="4.57">collapse of the health</text>
  <text start="662.17" dur="6.08">system or a collapse of society I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="665.709" dur="5.551">know I don&amp;#39;t know what event would</text>
  <text start="668.25" dur="6.13">happen that would cause divine healing</text>
  <text start="671.26" dur="5.31">to become a very important issue but</text>
  <text start="674.38" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s kind of how I interpret that</text>
  <text start="676.57" dur="6.87">dream now I want to talk about a</text>
  <text start="679.3" dur="8.339">secondary this dream I had on July 4th</text>
  <text start="683.44" dur="9.839">and this dream was July 4th 2010 the</text>
  <text start="687.639" dur="7.5">same year in that dream it took place I</text>
  <text start="693.279" dur="5.55">knew that this dream took place in the</text>
  <text start="695.139" dur="6.421">far distant future in the dream divine</text>
  <text start="698.829" dur="5.491">healing was seen as a scientific and</text>
  <text start="701.56" dur="9.54">highly organised field of study and</text>
  <text start="704.32" dur="8.579">practice all right so healing divine</text>
  <text start="711.1" dur="4.56">healing at that point was not seen as</text>
  <text start="712.899" dur="6.111">some kind of woowoo magical weird</text>
  <text start="715.66" dur="9.619">bizarre thing it was a highly organized</text>
  <text start="719.01" dur="9.25">respected and field of study all right I</text>
  <text start="725.279" dur="6.041">was a specialist in one type of healing</text>
  <text start="728.26" dur="5.88">that involved seeing the medical</text>
  <text start="731.32" dur="5.49">condition of a patient and praying for</text>
  <text start="734.14" dur="5.1">their healing out of what I saw now I</text>
  <text start="736.81" dur="6.24">want to stop here because when I was my</text>
  <text start="739.24" dur="8.4">very first experience with God they had</text>
  <text start="743.05" dur="7.07">to do with healing I had a dream and in</text>
  <text start="747.64" dur="5.43">the dream I met God and he told me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="750.12" dur="6.25">going to show you what is wrong with</text>
  <text start="753.07" dur="6.12">your patients and I want you to pray for</text>
  <text start="756.37" dur="6.149">them and when you do I&amp;#39;ll heal them but</text>
  <text start="759.19" dur="7.259">I often kind of overlook the fact that</text>
  <text start="762.519" dur="7.05">God told me he&amp;#39;s going to show me what</text>

  <text start="876.22" dur="9.21">was completely healed that was the end</text>
  <text start="880" dur="7.019">of the dream now just again looking at</text>
  <text start="885.43" dur="4.139">this prophetically and interpreting it</text>
  <text start="887.019" dur="5.79">for by the way that the drain was on</text>
  <text start="889.569" dur="4.591">July 4th and in the dream there were</text>
  <text start="892.809" dur="3.111">four different types of people who</text>
  <text start="894.16" dur="4.89">prayed in four different ways</text>

  <text start="922.07" dur="6.39">in the future in this dream I would pray</text>
  <text start="926.48" dur="4.47">for somebody out of what I saw and then</text>
  <text start="928.46" dur="5.73">they would my prayer would become part</text>
  <text start="930.95" dur="4.86">of their record their video file their</text>
  <text start="934.19" dur="4.44">record would then go on to somebody else</text>
  <text start="935.81" dur="4.17">who would pray in a different way that</text>

  <text start="962.18" dur="5.58">healing healing is not first of all</text>
  <text start="965.69" dur="4.02">healing is not a question of begging God</text>
  <text start="967.76" dur="6.42">to heal somebody that&amp;#39;s not how healing</text>
  <text start="969.71" dur="8.84">works healing has a lot of components</text>
  <text start="974.18" dur="8.79">part of healing involves releasing power</text>
  <text start="978.55" dur="6.16">we are conduits we are vessels the Holy</text>
  <text start="982.97" dur="4.02">Spirit lives inside of us and when we</text>
