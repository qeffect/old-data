  <text start="8.809" dur="5.29">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="4.88">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="2.571">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="17.42" dur="5.11">so mr. Michel it&amp;#39;s been a while since</text>
  <text start="20.37" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;ve done a podcast yes it has and do</text>
  <text start="22.53" dur="4.589">you have a new book out I do called</text>
  <text start="25.02" dur="3.57">faith to raise the dead I&amp;#39;m pretty</text>
  <text start="27.119" dur="3.031">excited about it this is a little</text>
  <text start="28.59" dur="3.21">interesting because now you&amp;#39;ve written</text>
  <text start="30.15" dur="3.54">two books on raising the dead and I</text>
  <text start="31.8" dur="3.21">haven&amp;#39;t written any and you&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="33.69" dur="4.11">me to shame and you&amp;#39;re making me feel</text>
  <text start="35.01" dur="5.22">insecure and inadequate so what the heck</text>
  <text start="37.8" dur="4.53">is up with you writing two books on</text>
  <text start="40.23" dur="4.56">raising the dead before I get a chance</text>
  <text start="42.33" dur="8.13">to write one if it makes you feel better</text>
  <text start="44.79" dur="8.58">your book so better than mine dude so</text>
  <text start="50.46" dur="4.32">you wrote and published practical keys</text>
  <text start="53.37" dur="5.219">to raising the dead that was a couple</text>
  <text start="54.78" dur="5.55">months ago October November I forget</text>
  <text start="58.589" dur="4.68">exactly that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s a short book</text>
  <text start="60.33" dur="4.92">yes it&amp;#39;s essentially just kind of down</text>
  <text start="63.269" dur="4.681">and dirty here are some practical tips</text>
  <text start="65.25" dur="4.92">and keys to raising the dead not a lot</text>
  <text start="67.95" dur="4.83">of theology not a lot of in-depth</text>
  <text start="70.17" dur="4.62">teaching I&amp;#39;m guessing it&amp;#39;s meant to be</text>
  <text start="72.78" dur="3.39">something that hopefully unless you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="74.79" dur="4.08">super slow reader you could read in 30</text>
  <text start="76.17" dur="5.73">minutes or less and the goal is because</text>
  <text start="78.87" dur="5.1">especially to like let&amp;#39;s say somebody</text>
  <text start="81.9" dur="4.2">dies you weren&amp;#39;t expecting it what do</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="3.72">you do well if you hop on Kindle you can</text>
  <text start="86.1" dur="4.38">find it read the book in less than 30</text>
  <text start="87.69" dur="6.12">minutes and all of a sudden you now know</text>
  <text start="90.48" dur="6.21">what to do and so I mean I wrote that</text>
  <text start="93.81" dur="5.22">specifically geared towards I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="96.69" dur="4.86">months to redevelop a theological belief</text>
  <text start="99.03" dur="5.61">system and whatever else I need to know</text>
  <text start="101.55" dur="6.66">what to do right now right where is</text>
  <text start="104.64" dur="6.24">faith to raise the dead it&amp;#39;s 290 pages</text>
  <text start="108.21" dur="4.8">long basically it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s much more of a</text>
  <text start="110.88" dur="5.37">I&amp;#39;ve got time to look at this sit with</text>
  <text start="113.01" dur="5.52">it study read and and really start</text>
  <text start="116.25" dur="4.17">delving into the situation and kind of</text>
  <text start="118.53" dur="3.33">be prepared in advance so I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="120.42" dur="4.14">your reports two different things</text>
  <text start="121.86" dur="4.35">and I will say to the practical Keys all</text>
  <text start="124.56" dur="3.539">of the stuff contained and practical</text>
  <text start="126.21" dur="4.829">keys to raise the dead is in faith raise</text>
  <text start="128.099" dur="6.301">the dead so faith to raise the dead is a</text>
  <text start="131.039" dur="5.791">longer work and what kind of topics do</text>
  <text start="134.4" dur="4.5">you cover in that book so we cover a lot</text>
  <text start="136.83" dur="3.93">of stuff the the book split into two</text>
  <text start="138.9" dur="3.75">parts the first part the theology of</text>
  <text start="140.76" dur="4.89">Resurrection has to do with altering our</text>
  <text start="142.65" dur="4.95">belief systems in ways that the</text>
  <text start="145.65" dur="3.96">basically help promote faith and help us</text>
  <text start="147.6" dur="3.39">engage spiritual principles to be</text>
  <text start="149.61" dur="4.11">successful</text>
  <text start="150.99" dur="5.07">based on changing the way we view God</text>
  <text start="153.72" dur="3.9">changing the way we view our Authority</text>
  <text start="156.06" dur="4.59">kind of changing our perspectives as a</text>
  <text start="157.62" dur="4.59">whole and and then the second cat the</text>
  <text start="160.65" dur="3.21">second part of the book is geared more</text>
  <text start="162.21" dur="4.98">towards okay what do I actually do now</text>
  <text start="163.86" dur="5.19">so the first part is changing our belief</text>
  <text start="167.19" dur="4.62">systems changing our understanding of</text>
  <text start="169.05" dur="5.07">God changing the way we view death and</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="5.7">resurrection and eternal life and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="4.83">guessing that it&amp;#39;s your view that a lot</text>
  <text start="177.51" dur="4.47">of us are not raising the dead</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="6.57">because we have faulty belief systems</text>
  <text start="181.98" dur="6.24">that inform us of things that are not</text>
  <text start="185.52" dur="4.14">actually God&amp;#39;s heart for death and</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="2.52">resurrection I think that&amp;#39;s probably a</text>
  <text start="189.66" dur="2.1">good way of putting it I mean I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="190.74" dur="2.85">know that I would have said it that way</text>
  <text start="191.76" dur="3.78">but I mean I think that&amp;#39;s basically it</text>
  <text start="193.59" dur="3.54">yeah I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of factors</text>
  <text start="195.54" dur="4.56">that influence whether we raise the dead</text>
  <text start="197.13" dur="5.67">but I think the the main one is that we</text>
  <text start="200.1" dur="4.41">have what I call a death culture we we</text>
  <text start="202.8" dur="4.11">believe and expect people to die and</text>
  <text start="204.51" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s not just in the church in the</text>
  <text start="206.91" dur="3.72">body that&amp;#39;s of Christ that&amp;#39;s I mean</text>
  <text start="208.8" dur="5.19">that&amp;#39;s worldwide we expect people to die</text>
  <text start="210.63" dur="6.12">we have involved the rituals of how</text>
  <text start="213.99" dur="4.14">people die what to do when they die so</text>
  <text start="216.75" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;ve got really deeply entrenched</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="4.26">beliefs surrounding an expectation of</text>
  <text start="220.47" dur="3.84">death and so what we have to start doing</text>
  <text start="222.39" dur="4.28">is we have to start changing kind of a</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="5.55">corporate consciousness if you will or a</text>
  <text start="226.67" dur="6.1">world consciousness surrounding death</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="4.89">and life because until we start</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="4.04">transforming our beliefs it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="234.75" dur="5.73">hard to expect to get different results</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="5.65">right because your practices are going</text>
  <text start="240.48" dur="4.47">to be an outworking of what you believe</text>
  <text start="242.46" dur="4.08">to be true exactly you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="244.95" dur="3.12">pray for people to be healed if you</text>
  <text start="246.54" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t believe in healing you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="4.38">going to have faith to raise the dead if</text>
  <text start="250.68" dur="4.44">you don&amp;#39;t believe that God wants people</text>
  <text start="252.45" dur="4.59">resurrected the thing is to like there</text>
  <text start="255.12" dur="5.31">there are times where people generally</text>
  <text start="257.04" dur="5.94">believe that God wants to to raise</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="4.44">people in general but the question is</text>
  <text start="262.98" dur="3.39">does God want to raise this specific</text>
  <text start="264.87" dur="3.48">person in front of me and you actually</text>
  <text start="266.37" dur="4.74">talk about it in divine healing made</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="4.23">simple you talk about on your one of the</text>
  <text start="271.11" dur="3.15">chapters you write about faith you talk</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="4.11">about general faith and you talk about</text>
  <text start="274.26" dur="4.11">specific faith and how people grow in</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="4.5">general faith for things that God</text>
  <text start="278.37" dur="4.799">generally wants to heal people but that</text>
  <text start="281.19" dur="3.779">on some level we also need to grow in</text>
  <text start="283.169" dur="3.66">specific faith for specific</text>
  <text start="284.969" dur="3.66">things and this is kind of one of those</text>
  <text start="286.829" dur="3.39">things it&amp;#39;s like yeah we generally</text>
  <text start="288.629" dur="5.28">believe oh God wants to raise somebody</text>
  <text start="290.219" dur="6.48">somewhere but we need to transform to</text>
  <text start="293.909" dur="5.52">understand when and who God specifically</text>
  <text start="296.699" dur="3.84">wants to raise because that&amp;#39;s where they</text>
  <text start="299.429" dur="2.73">really where the rubber meets the road</text>
  <text start="300.539" dur="4.77">when you&amp;#39;re in front of a dead body and</text>
  <text start="302.159" dur="4.86">you need to say okay is it God&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="305.309" dur="4.5">for this person come back how do I know</text>
  <text start="307.019" dur="4.95">that so how can I pray in faith to</text>
  <text start="309.809" dur="3.12">believe that this is what God wants and</text>
  <text start="311.969" dur="2.58">the only way you can do that</text>
  <text start="312.929" dur="4.53">successfully is if you already know</text>
  <text start="314.549" dur="5.22">God&amp;#39;s will so Christians understand okay</text>
  <text start="317.459" dur="3.45">Jesus raised people from the dead</text>
  <text start="319.769" dur="3.18">the disciples raised people from the</text>
  <text start="320.909" dur="4.44">dead Elijah raised people from the dead</text>
  <text start="322.949" dur="4.83">so we as a culture we understand the</text>
  <text start="325.349" dur="3.99">concept that yes God every once in a</text>
  <text start="327.779" dur="3.54">while will raise somebody from the dead</text>
  <text start="329.339" dur="3.9">but we haven&amp;#39;t yet gotten to this point</text>
  <text start="331.319" dur="4.71">where we think that it should be natural</text>
  <text start="333.239" dur="5.49">or expected I mean I worked as a medic</text>
  <text start="336.029" dur="4.41">you work as a nurse we see people die</text>
  <text start="338.729" dur="3.87">all the time and I have prayed for</text>
  <text start="340.439" dur="5.01">people to come back from the dead I</text>
  <text start="342.599" dur="5.52">haven&amp;#39;t had that great of success yet</text>
  <text start="345.449" dur="4.44">but you know I&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="348.119" dur="4.77">miraculous and I&amp;#39;ve seen healing and</text>
  <text start="349.889" dur="5.49">I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of supernatural things</text>
  <text start="352.889" dur="4.77">happen I don&amp;#39;t think my faith has gotten</text>
  <text start="355.379" dur="5.43">to the place yet for resurrection where</text>
  <text start="357.659" dur="5.34">I&amp;#39;m really truly expecting people to get</text>
  <text start="360.809" dur="4.77">up from the dead without dumping a bunch</text>
  <text start="362.999" dur="3.24">of epinephrine and I shocking them a few</text>
  <text start="365.579" dur="4.14">times</text>
  <text start="366.239" dur="6.27">little atropine yes exactly you know I</text>
  <text start="369.719" dur="5.19">know stories I mean I talked to Jesse</text>
  <text start="372.509" dur="3.96">Berkey and he&amp;#39;s seen a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="374.909" dur="3.74">raise from the dead in his ambulance</text>
  <text start="376.469" dur="5.04">just through faith without</text>
  <text start="378.649" dur="6.07">defibrillation no intubation no</text>
  <text start="381.509" dur="5.64">epinephrine he has demonstrated amazing</text>
  <text start="384.719" dur="4.77">faith for raising a debt and I point to</text>
  <text start="387.149" dur="4.14">people like him as forerunners like</text>
  <text start="389.489" dur="2.94">here&amp;#39;s a guy who&amp;#39;s doing it he&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="3.27">there he is</text>
  <text start="392.429" dur="4.71">he&amp;#39;s got faith he&amp;#39;s seen people raised</text>
  <text start="394.559" dur="5.88">from the dead I know that it happens and</text>
  <text start="397.139" dur="5.54">I&amp;#39;m trying to wrap my mind around how do</text>
  <text start="400.439" dur="4.41">I get to that next place where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="402.679" dur="2.86">expecting people to be resurrected when</text>
  <text start="404.849" dur="2.64">I pray for them</text>
  <text start="405.539" dur="7.8">well easy you read my book no more</text>
  <text start="407.489" dur="7.68">serious I think some of it is like I</text>
  <text start="413.339" dur="3.81">said I really do think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="415.169" dur="3.661">a mindset shift but some of it is that</text>
  <text start="417.149" dur="3.631">we kind of get some</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="4.05">time&amp;#39;s what we expect and if if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="4.35">not used to expecting to raise people</text>
  <text start="422.88" dur="3.87">from the dead then when all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="425.13" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re in a situation where it needs to</text>
  <text start="426.75" dur="3.84">happen and I say needs to happen in</text>
  <text start="428.76" dur="3.41">every situation where somebody dies it</text>
  <text start="430.59" dur="3.96">basically needs to happen is my opinion</text>
  <text start="432.17" dur="3.88">when we&amp;#39;re in a situation we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="434.55" dur="3.27">really know if we quote/unquote have</text>
  <text start="436.05" dur="3.15">enough faith and that&amp;#39;s where we just</text>
  <text start="437.82" dur="3.51">have to step out and assume we do</text>
  <text start="439.2" dur="3.66">because there&amp;#39;s no convenient faith</text>
  <text start="441.33" dur="2.91">measure or tool and it would be really</text>
  <text start="442.86" dur="3.75">nice if there was like I actually</text>
  <text start="444.24" dur="5.52">mentioned in the book and it&amp;#39;s fun to me</text>
  <text start="446.61" dur="5.37">but like in the cartoon animation Ball Z</text>
  <text start="449.76" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;ve got these like power level</text>
  <text start="451.98" dur="3.57">measures where it&amp;#39;s like this Bluetooth</text>
  <text start="454.14" dur="3.72">thing that&amp;#39;s it you are on your I almost</text>
  <text start="455.55" dur="3.81">that it can measure how much power</text>
  <text start="457.86" dur="3.3">somebody&amp;#39;s got well if we had a</text>
  <text start="459.36" dur="3.57">convenient little faith measure that we</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="4.38">could just pop on and measure it that</text>
  <text start="462.93" dur="4.26">would be really nice but lacking that on</text>
  <text start="465.54" dur="3.39">some level we just have to assume that</text>
  <text start="467.19" dur="3.72">God&amp;#39;s equipped us with what we need in</text>
  <text start="468.93" dur="4.47">that moment and just step out and</text>
  <text start="470.91" dur="4.95">sometimes that&amp;#39;s how miracles happen is</text>
  <text start="473.4" dur="3.99">at least the first time you just step</text>
  <text start="475.86" dur="3.45">out with kind of a wing and a prayer if</text>
  <text start="477.39" dur="4.02">you will and say you know what God this</text>
  <text start="479.31" dur="3.81">is what your word says so I&amp;#39;m gonna put</text>
  <text start="481.41" dur="4.44">action to it and we&amp;#39;ll see what happens</text>
  <text start="483.12" dur="5.16">and whether it happens or not I think as</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="4.41">we go we start to realize more and more</text>
  <text start="488.28" dur="3.33">that there&amp;#39;s a need and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.26" dur="3.3">kind of where the it&amp;#39;s a gradual</text>
  <text start="491.61" dur="3.9">transformation process and so I think</text>
  <text start="493.56" dur="3.27">sometimes it&amp;#39;s not necessarily oh do I</text>
  <text start="495.51" dur="3.03">have enough faith for that I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="496.83" dur="4.29">faith for healing do I have faith for</text>
  <text start="498.54" dur="4.41">resurrection well it&amp;#39;s all based in the</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="5.01">abundant life of Jesus Christ and I</text>
  <text start="502.95" dur="4.65">think I think sometimes we we bought we</text>
  <text start="506.13" dur="4.2">separate things that we chopped them up</text>
  <text start="507.6" dur="4.29">a little too much and and when we say</text>
  <text start="510.33" dur="3.72">well I&amp;#39;ve got faith for healing for</text>
  <text start="511.89" dur="4.23">lungs but not for eyes and I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="514.05" dur="3.84">faith well I mean we do and we and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.12" dur="5.19">all guilty of it on some level you know</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="5.37">but because and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s human</text>
  <text start="521.31" dur="3.69">experience too because we&amp;#39;re used to</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="2.97">what we&amp;#39;ve experienced and so we get</text>
  <text start="525" dur="3.84">comfortable with that I&amp;#39;m great with</text>
  <text start="526.23" dur="3.69">headaches I&amp;#39;m great with I mean there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="528.84" dur="2.31">different stuff that I&amp;#39;m really good</text>
  <text start="529.92" dur="2.79">with when it comes to healing and</text>
  <text start="531.15" dur="3.3">there&amp;#39;s other stuff I just don&amp;#39;t get as</text>
  <text start="532.71" dur="4.47">good results in why is that</text>
  <text start="534.45" dur="4.53">who knows doesn&amp;#39;t really matter but the</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="4.32">fact is if I can see results in some</text>
  <text start="538.98" dur="5.25">area then I&amp;#39;m seeing the life of Christ</text>
  <text start="541.5" dur="4.32">released into that condition well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.23" dur="3.33">the same life of Christ it&amp;#39;s gonna raise</text>
  <text start="545.82" dur="3.33">the dead it&amp;#39;s the same way that life of</text>
  <text start="547.56" dur="3.63">Christ it&amp;#39;s gonna you know solve</text>
  <text start="549.15" dur="3.51">financial problems it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the same</text>
  <text start="551.19" dur="4.29">Jesus and it&amp;#39;s the same power</text>
  <text start="552.66" dur="4.95">so sometimes like I said I think we</text>
  <text start="555.48" dur="4.53">complicate things too much by setting</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="5.01">things into these these divided you know</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="4.5">mental boxes I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s hard for</text>
  <text start="562.62" dur="4.2">me not to do that you know I look at</text>
  <text start="564.51" dur="4.98">people like you and the people you hang</text>
  <text start="566.82" dur="5.49">around with and a lot of them see</text>
  <text start="569.49" dur="6.54">gemstones manifest I have never seen a</text>
  <text start="572.31" dur="5.07">gemstone manifest not that many yes no</text>
  <text start="576.03" dur="3">but I mean you know what I&amp;#39;m saying</text>
  <text start="577.38" dur="3.33">you have a gemstone collection you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="579.03" dur="4.53">had gemstone parties you&amp;#39;ve had people</text>
  <text start="580.71" dur="5.07">there when gemstones have fallen you</text>
  <text start="583.56" dur="5.28">have a history with that I don&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="585.78" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;m envious or jealous for</text>
  <text start="588.84" dur="4.53">me and for a lot of people it&amp;#39;s common</text>
  <text start="591.39" dur="4.14">for us to look at these experiences and</text>
  <text start="593.37" dur="4.29">go ok why does this guy have gemstones</text>
  <text start="595.53" dur="4.86">manifest I have this friend on Facebook</text>
  <text start="597.66" dur="4.38">named Cherie she has seen dozens and</text>
  <text start="600.39" dur="4.29">dozens possibly hundreds of dental</text>
  <text start="602.04" dur="4.89">miracles she has what I would say great</text>
  <text start="604.68" dur="4.41">faith for dental miracles I wouldn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="606.93" dur="4.35">she hasn&amp;#39;t anointing for dental miracles</text>
  <text start="609.09" dur="4.53">but when she prays for someone who needs</text>
  <text start="611.28" dur="4.8">a root canal when she prays for someone</text>
  <text start="613.62" dur="4.71">who&amp;#39;s got chipped teeth she expects that</text>
  <text start="616.08" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re going to receive a miracle and</text>
  <text start="618.33" dur="3.63">many times they do I don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="620.46" dur="2.61">I&amp;#39;ve seen more than one or two dental</text>
  <text start="621.96" dur="2.88">miracles and all the time I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="623.07" dur="5.31">praying for people I&amp;#39;m not like a super</text>
  <text start="624.84" dur="4.23">analytic person but I do like to yeah</text>
  <text start="628.38" dur="3.12">you are</text>
  <text start="629.07" dur="5.4">I like to I like to look at situations</text>
  <text start="631.5" dur="5.82">and go ok what is that person doing what</text>
  <text start="634.47" dur="4.74">are they what do they have where is</text>
  <text start="637.32" dur="4.41">their faith that why are they seeing</text>
  <text start="639.21" dur="4.11">this manifest and I&amp;#39;m not or why am I</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="3.63">saying something manifest and another</text>
  <text start="643.32" dur="4.44">person isn&amp;#39;t why do I have crazy dreams</text>
  <text start="645.36" dur="5.64">and other people don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m always trying</text>
  <text start="647.76" dur="5.28">to understand is it just a gift is it a</text>
  <text start="651" dur="4.56">higher level of faith what is it that</text>
  <text start="653.04" dur="4.65">makes these things common for some</text>
  <text start="655.56" dur="3.42">people but not for others yeah I think</text>
  <text start="657.69" dur="4.11">that I mean that&amp;#39;s one of the things</text>
  <text start="658.98" dur="4.56">that I mean you and I both do and and I</text>
  <text start="661.8" dur="3.39">would say that you are a fairly analytic</text>
  <text start="663.54" dur="3.96">person in that regard because we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="665.19" dur="4.44">always trying to we&amp;#39;re always trying to</text>
  <text start="667.5" dur="4.17">break down and understand kind of the</text>
  <text start="669.63" dur="4.8">functional parts behind why things work</text>
  <text start="671.67" dur="4.38">as opposed to like there are some people</text>
  <text start="674.43" dur="3.15">that it&amp;#39;s like oh great</text>
  <text start="676.05" dur="3.18">you know God said and I believe it that</text>
  <text start="677.58" dur="3.27">settles it and I&amp;#39;m like well God said it</text>
  <text start="679.23" dur="3.75">I believe it but I mean like I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="680.85" dur="3.87">understand why it works how it works and</text>
  <text start="682.98" dur="3.51">how I can increase the frequency of it</text>
  <text start="684.72" dur="3.45">working and I mean you&amp;#39;re the same way</text>
  <text start="686.49" dur="3.21">like you said you know you want to</text>
  <text start="688.17" dur="3.27">understand so what is it about Sherrie</text>
  <text start="689.7" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s getting Dental miracles that that</text>
  <text start="691.44" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re not I mean when I say like I think</text>
  <text start="693.93" dur="4.38">we break things up too much there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="695.85" dur="4.5">measure to which yes we do break things</text>
  <text start="698.31" dur="3.87">up for a reason it&amp;#39;s because we see that</text>
  <text start="700.35" dur="3.69">people consistently have results in one</text>
  <text start="702.18" dur="3.75">area and not another and so if you want</text>
  <text start="704.04" dur="3.54">a dental miracle go to Sherry not me</text>
  <text start="705.93" dur="3.06">not because you couldn&amp;#39;t maybe get a</text>
  <text start="707.58" dur="3.03">result if I pray for you because I do</text>
  <text start="708.99" dur="4.05">believe in divine healing and I do get</text>
  <text start="710.61" dur="3.66">results with things it&amp;#39;s just I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="713.04" dur="3.21">know that I&amp;#39;ve ever seen a dental</text>
  <text start="714.27" dur="3.81">miracle and she&amp;#39;s obviously getting good</text>
  <text start="716.25" dur="4.17">results ago where the results are you</text>
  <text start="718.08" dur="3.33">know at the same time I&amp;#39;m just saying I</text>
  <text start="720.42" dur="3.32">think there&amp;#39;s a measure to which</text>
  <text start="721.41" dur="4.5">sometimes we also can simultaneously</text>
  <text start="723.74" dur="4">overcomplicate which is that I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="725.91" dur="3.6">seen it before and therefore I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="727.74" dur="4.44">have any likelihood of seeing it now or</text>
  <text start="729.51" dur="4.71">in the future right and that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="3.66">how I&amp;#39;ve approached this in the past</text>
  <text start="734.22" dur="4.2">like when someone comes to me and says</text>
  <text start="735.84" dur="4.26">hey you got some cracked teeth I&amp;#39;ll tell</text>
  <text start="738.42" dur="3.21">them okay well I&amp;#39;ll pray for you and by</text>
  <text start="740.1" dur="3.39">the way you should send a message to</text>
  <text start="741.63" dur="3.84">this friend of mine who has a really</text>
  <text start="743.49" dur="3.96">good record for dental miracles because</text>
  <text start="745.47" dur="4.2">she just he just seems to have that but</text>
  <text start="747.45" dur="3.57">when it comes to raising the dead I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="749.67" dur="4.53">heard a lot of testimonies of people who</text>
  <text start="751.02" dur="5.1">have seen the dead raised and many times</text>
  <text start="754.2" dur="3.36">they&amp;#39;ll get some prophetic revelation</text>
  <text start="756.12" dur="3.39">about something they&amp;#39;re supposed to do</text>
  <text start="757.56" dur="3.78">to make that happen and the person does</text>
  <text start="759.51" dur="3.06">get raised from the dead yeah well I</text>
  <text start="761.34" dur="4.44">think sometimes it&amp;#39;s the difference</text>
  <text start="762.57" dur="5.25">between a protocol you know acting out</text>
  <text start="765.78" dur="3.84">of a protocol versus being spirit-led</text>
  <text start="767.82" dur="4.11">and I&amp;#39;m a fan of both I mean I know you</text>
  <text start="769.62" dur="5.01">are - you&amp;#39;re a fan of both like let&amp;#39;s do</text>
  <text start="771.93" dur="4.44">both I mean I don&amp;#39;t have to wonder can I</text>
  <text start="774.63" dur="3.96">go address this situation the answer&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="776.37" dur="3.15">yes and I&amp;#39;ll start with protocol and for</text>
  <text start="778.59" dur="3.09">those who don&amp;#39;t know what that means</text>
  <text start="779.52" dur="5.04">that basically means in the in the</text>
  <text start="781.68" dur="5.31">medical field we have we have certain</text>
  <text start="784.56" dur="4.71">things that we in our were allowed to do</text>
  <text start="786.99" dur="3.9">because a physician somewhere has signed</text>
  <text start="789.27" dur="3.66">a piece of paper in advance that says</text>
  <text start="790.89" dur="4.02">when these types of things happen you</text>
  <text start="792.93" dur="4.32">are allowed to do these sets of things</text>
  <text start="794.91" dur="4.11">if it goes outside of that set of</text>
  <text start="797.25" dur="3.36">circumstances then we&amp;#39;re not allowed to</text>
  <text start="799.02" dur="3.54">do it we have to get spec we have to get</text>
  <text start="800.61" dur="4.71">immediate permission first spiritually</text>
  <text start="802.56" dur="4.65">speaking a protocol is where we can go</text>
  <text start="805.32" dur="3.42">take care of situations you know pray</text>
  <text start="807.21" dur="3.54">for the sick or whatever it is without</text>
  <text start="808.74" dur="4.29">having to see guidance specifically from</text>
  <text start="810.75" dur="5.46">God on God am I allowed to do this what</text>
  <text start="813.03" dur="5.01">do I do it&amp;#39;s essentially a formula yeah</text>
  <text start="816.21" dur="4.1">essentially but I mean it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="818.04" dur="3.59">formula based on a</text>
  <text start="820.31" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s not like legalistic and that you</text>
  <text start="821.63" dur="4.44">have to do it this way it&amp;#39;s more that</text>
  <text start="823.61" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s permissive in the sense of we know</text>
  <text start="826.07" dur="3.81">that because we have Authority as</text>
  <text start="827.45" dur="4.53">children of God that we can take care of</text>
  <text start="829.88" dur="4.86">these things and we figured out ways</text>
  <text start="831.98" dur="3.48">that tend to be effective so we just</text>
  <text start="834.74" dur="2.67">start with that</text>
  <text start="835.46" dur="4.11">but then like you&amp;#39;re saying from there</text>
  <text start="837.41" dur="5.04">you have to be led by the spirit and</text>
  <text start="839.57" dur="5.04">adjust as you go with the revelation</text>
  <text start="842.45" dur="4.38">that God&amp;#39;s giving us my my protocol for</text>
  <text start="844.61" dur="4.05">physical healing I have a protocol I</text>
  <text start="846.83" dur="3.6">have a formula when you talk about</text>
  <text start="848.66" dur="3">healing everyone says Howard you know</text>
  <text start="850.43" dur="6.69">you don&amp;#39;t ever use the formula for</text>
  <text start="851.66" dur="7.83">yelling well actually I have some steps</text>
  <text start="857.12" dur="4.31">that I routinely do every time I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="859.49" dur="7.53">praying for someone to be healed I</text>
  <text start="861.43" dur="8.62">release power I exercise authority I ask</text>
  <text start="867.02" dur="6.36">God to bring his presence alright I have</text>
  <text start="870.05" dur="5.94">these steps that I routinely use because</text>
  <text start="873.38" dur="5.13">I know that they work and the thing is I</text>
  <text start="875.99" dur="4.349">don&amp;#39;t know in each case is it going to</text>
  <text start="878.51" dur="4.65">be a release of power or is it going to</text>
  <text start="880.339" dur="4.441">be exercising Authority or is it going</text>
  <text start="883.16" dur="3.45">to be Oh need to go to the court of</text>
  <text start="884.78" dur="3.42">heaven or is it oh they just got healed</text>
  <text start="886.61" dur="3.479">and casting out a demon God&amp;#39;s glory oh</text>
  <text start="888.2" dur="3.87">hello there&amp;#39;s a demon there right</text>
  <text start="890.089" dur="4.621">so I&amp;#39;m command spirits of pain to leave</text>
  <text start="892.07" dur="3.39">I have like five or six steps that I use</text>
  <text start="894.71" dur="2.61">routinely</text>
  <text start="895.46" dur="4.44">when I&amp;#39;m trying to do healing because I</text>
  <text start="897.32" dur="4.83">don&amp;#39;t know which one is going to be the</text>
  <text start="899.9" dur="4.439">one that works so I use all of them</text>
  <text start="902.15" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s kind of my protocol for Yuling I</text>
  <text start="904.339" dur="3.871">do the same thing I usually start just</text>
  <text start="906.56" dur="3.3">by commanding and or you know power and</text>
  <text start="908.21" dur="3.33">authority I&amp;#39;ll command and I&amp;#39;ll pray and</text>
  <text start="909.86" dur="3.09">I usually have them check if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="911.54" dur="3.299">something that like pain or something</text>
  <text start="912.95" dur="3.57">they can test out just to see did that</text>
  <text start="914.839" dur="2.791">take care of it if not from there I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="916.52" dur="3">usually just go immediately to</text>
  <text start="917.63" dur="3.42">commanding demon who I describe as a</text>
  <text start="919.52" dur="3.21">supernaturally empowered natural problem</text>
  <text start="921.05" dur="2.76">so I just assume instantly if you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="922.73" dur="3.54">a problem there&amp;#39;s a demonic</text>
  <text start="923.81" dur="4.11">manifestation somewhere involved so if</text>
  <text start="926.27" dur="3.99">it didn&amp;#39;t get fixed first off command</text>
  <text start="927.92" dur="4.23">the demon off oftentimes their pain will</text>
  <text start="930.26" dur="3.6">instantly decrease or they&amp;#39;ll have a</text>
  <text start="932.15" dur="3.21">weird sensation sometimes the pain will</text>
  <text start="933.86" dur="4.02">get worse so I mean I deal with that and</text>
  <text start="935.36" dur="3.9">then from there if I&amp;#39;m praying a couple</text>
  <text start="937.88" dur="3.41">times then nothing&amp;#39;s happening from</text>
  <text start="939.26" dur="4.65">there I go into emotional healing</text>
  <text start="941.29" dur="4.29">exactly I&amp;#39;ve actually put emotional</text>
  <text start="943.91" dur="3.57">healing higher up on the protocol</text>
  <text start="945.58" dur="4.509">especially with people who have received</text>
  <text start="947.48" dur="5.49">a lot of prayer and they haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="950.089" dur="3.991">healed yeah if they have gone to</text>
  <text start="952.97" dur="2.67">churches and gone to</text>
  <text start="954.08" dur="3.6">places that have a good track record for</text>
  <text start="955.64" dur="5.28">healing and it&amp;#39;s been a long time and</text>
  <text start="957.68" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re still not healed I kind of start</text>
  <text start="960.92" dur="4.17">with emotional healing at that point</text>
  <text start="962.33" dur="4.26">because is they power people have</text>
  <text start="965.09" dur="3.3">released power people have tried a</text>
  <text start="966.59" dur="2.82">thoroughly they tried she&amp;#39;s been through</text>
  <text start="968.39" dur="3.12">deliverance they&amp;#39;ve been through this</text>
  <text start="969.41" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;ve been through that and what I found</text>
  <text start="971.51" dur="3.6">is a lot of people haven&amp;#39;t been through</text>
  <text start="973.01" dur="5.25">the emotional healing process that I use</text>
  <text start="975.11" dur="5.58">so I kind of move that up the protocol</text>
  <text start="978.26" dur="4.38">and I use that a lot more often now and</text>
  <text start="980.69" dur="3.69">I&amp;#39;m seeing pretty good results with it</text>
  <text start="982.64" dur="3.33">actually well that&amp;#39;s because it works</text>
  <text start="984.38" dur="2.91">and I think that&amp;#39;s the key is I mean</text>
  <text start="985.97" dur="2.46">there are times that I talk to people</text>
  <text start="987.29" dur="2.7">that like oh you have to be like that</text>
  <text start="988.43" dur="3.45">spirit I&amp;#39;m not saying don&amp;#39;t be led by</text>
  <text start="989.99" dur="4.68">the spirit I&amp;#39;m just saying that the Holy</text>
  <text start="991.88" dur="4.23">Spirit&amp;#39;s given us wisdom and insight you</text>
  <text start="994.67" dur="2.97">know as we&amp;#39;ve analyzed and looked at</text>
  <text start="996.11" dur="3.15">these things we know some of what works</text>
  <text start="997.64" dur="3.06">we know some of what doesn&amp;#39;t work so</text>
  <text start="999.26" dur="3.48">instead of trying a bunch of stuff that</text>
  <text start="1000.7" dur="3.54">probably won&amp;#39;t work we start with the</text>
  <text start="1002.74" dur="3.3">things that tend to be effective and</text>
  <text start="1004.24" dur="4.95">they take care of 50% or more of the</text>
  <text start="1006.04" dur="4.74">problems when we do it this way and I</text>

  <text start="1010.78" dur="3.9">like to say that it&amp;#39;s the same way in</text>
  <text start="1012.25" dur="5.01">that oh if you do these things you know</text>
  <text start="1014.68" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;ll get raised fifty percent of the</text>

  <text start="1019.33" dur="6.24">true otherwise that have a track record</text>
  <text start="1022.12" dur="5.73">at 50 percent instead of zero but and</text>
  <text start="1025.57" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ve tried on close to twenty people</text>
  <text start="1027.85" dur="3.93">animals whatever I mean I&amp;#39;ve tried it</text>
  <text start="1030.13" dur="3.18">with enough people that trust me if it</text>
  <text start="1031.78" dur="3.45">was batting close to fifty percent I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1033.31" dur="3.69">be aware of it but but there are still</text>
  <text start="1035.23" dur="3.57">protocols I think of things that we can</text>
  <text start="1037" dur="4.92">do there are spiritual principles that</text>
  <text start="1038.8" dur="6.09">they work because they work and so just</text>
  <text start="1041.92" dur="5.25">continue to work them unless God brings</text>
  <text start="1044.89" dur="5.13">something more clear and specific along</text>
  <text start="1047.17" dur="4.56">in the situation right because sometimes</text>
  <text start="1050.02" dur="3.42">you&amp;#39;re not going to get divine</text>
  <text start="1051.73" dur="4.38">revelation and if you&amp;#39;re not getting</text>
  <text start="1053.44" dur="4.98">divine revelation you need to go through</text>
  <text start="1056.11" dur="3.9">the protocols and you start with this</text>
  <text start="1058.42" dur="3.72">and you try this and you try that and</text>
  <text start="1060.01" dur="4.62">you try that and then if you are getting</text>
  <text start="1062.14" dur="4.44">divine revelation then you can throw the</text>
  <text start="1064.63" dur="4.11">protocol book out and go this is what</text>
  <text start="1066.58" dur="4.32">the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s sake let&amp;#39;s do this and</text>
  <text start="1068.74" dur="3.09">let&amp;#39;s do that and sometimes what is in</text>
  <text start="1070.9" dur="2.34">the protocol</text>
  <text start="1071.83" dur="3.72">well like should be with all the spirits</text>
  <text start="1073.24" dur="4.47">telling you to do he&amp;#39;ll just tell you go</text>
  <text start="1075.55" dur="3.6">to step five and forget the other four</text>
  <text start="1077.71" dur="4.23">steps because this is what they need in</text>
  <text start="1079.15" dur="5.97">any situation I think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s key to</text>
  <text start="1081.94" dur="4.86">listen to what God&amp;#39;s saying but God also</text>
  <text start="1085.12" dur="2.82">wants to train and teach us and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1086.8" dur="3.45">and that&amp;#39;s kind of some of</text>
  <text start="1087.94" dur="3.989">my heart with this subject is that we</text>
  <text start="1090.25" dur="3.919">have a lot of really good teaching about</text>
  <text start="1091.929" dur="4.62">healing we&amp;#39;ve got a lot of good teaching</text>
  <text start="1094.169" dur="4.51">about emotional healing it&amp;#39;s just a lot</text>
  <text start="1096.549" dur="3.36">of people haven&amp;#39;t necessarily run into</text>
  <text start="1098.679" dur="3.811">that teaching but there&amp;#39;s a lot of good</text>
  <text start="1099.909" dur="4.321">teaching on the subject there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1102.49" dur="3.75">good teaching out there but I think</text>
  <text start="1104.23" dur="4.26">really the church has been in a really</text>
  <text start="1106.24" dur="3.6">unhealthy place in regards to our</text>
  <text start="1108.49" dur="3.87">understanding about Resurrection and</text>
  <text start="1109.84" dur="4.23">abundant life and and it shows in the</text>
  <text start="1112.36" dur="4.439">results we get really I mean if you</text>
  <text start="1114.07" dur="4.65">think about it if we really understood</text>
  <text start="1116.799" dur="5.34">the depths of the abundant life that God</text>
  <text start="1118.72" dur="4.86">has for us then the health of people in</text>
  <text start="1122.139" dur="3.15">the church would be drastically</text>
  <text start="1123.58" dur="3.78">different than the health of people who</text>
  <text start="1125.289" dur="4.081">aren&amp;#39;t followers of Jesus a lot of</text>
  <text start="1127.36" dur="3.539">leaders talked about what great faith</text>
  <text start="1129.37" dur="3.899">they have or what great teaching they</text>
  <text start="1130.899" dur="5.791">have or what great programs they have</text>
  <text start="1133.269" dur="5.931">but if you look at the fruit that those</text>
  <text start="1136.69" dur="4.739">ministries are bearing the fruit says</text>
  <text start="1139.2" dur="4">what they&amp;#39;re doing isn&amp;#39;t all that good</text>
  <text start="1141.429" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;ve got a lot of really sick people</text>
  <text start="1143.2" dur="4.349">you&amp;#39;ve got a lot of people who die too</text>
  <text start="1145.149" dur="4.711">young you have people that are</text>
  <text start="1147.549" dur="4.651">relatively powerless and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1149.86" dur="4.949">understand their authority and you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1152.2" dur="7.53">got a it&amp;#39;s kind of a mess in in the body</text>
  <text start="1154.809" dur="8.191">of Christ if we were walking in a true</text>
  <text start="1159.73" dur="7.079">knowledge of our identity and who we are</text>
  <text start="1163" dur="6.21">as sons of God the fruit that we would</text>
  <text start="1166.809" dur="4.381">be bearing would be a lot different I</text>
  <text start="1169.21" dur="4.949">think most of us are just still in the</text>
  <text start="1171.19" dur="4.949">shallow end of the pool and I would</text>
  <text start="1174.159" dur="3.48">probably put myself in there too look I</text>
  <text start="1176.139" dur="3.03">I&amp;#39;m not seeing a lot of people raised</text>
  <text start="1177.639" dur="3.63">from the dead right now I&amp;#39;m not seeing</text>
  <text start="1179.169" dur="5.311">gemstones manifest you know it will I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1181.269" dur="5.28">not seeing oil and gold dust all over</text>
  <text start="1184.48" dur="4.559">the place and I&amp;#39;m not just this walking</text>
  <text start="1186.549" dur="5.701">signs and wonders guy like I could be</text>
  <text start="1189.039" dur="5.401">and I think a lot of that comes around</text>
  <text start="1192.25" dur="5.1">to the fact that I still need to get my</text>
  <text start="1194.44" dur="6.3">mind renewed and my spirit renewed and I</text>
  <text start="1197.35" dur="5.76">need a better understanding of what</text>
  <text start="1200.74" dur="4.74">God&amp;#39;s heart really is for the abundant</text>
  <text start="1203.11" dur="4.169">life I mean I feel the same way I feel</text>
  <text start="1205.48" dur="3.029">like I mean I kind of really the church</text>
  <text start="1207.279" dur="1.441">as a whole is in the shallow end of the</text>
  <text start="1208.509" dur="1.321">pool</text>
  <text start="1208.72" dur="2.459">I mean I&amp;#39;ve written two books on</text>
  <text start="1209.83" dur="4.439">different signs and wonders already and</text>
  <text start="1211.179" dur="4.71">I mean I sure I see feathers and stuff I</text>
  <text start="1214.269" dur="3.691">mean I had one show up yesterday or the</text>
  <text start="1215.889" dur="3.48">day before while I was having an</text>
  <text start="1217.96" dur="2.699">argument with my wife and typing</text>
  <text start="1219.369" dur="2.381">something on the computer and I felt</text>
  <text start="1220.659" dur="5.621">like it was God just</text>
  <text start="1221.75" dur="6.96">of helping me shift where I was at</text>
  <text start="1226.28" dur="3.78">but but I mean as a general hole I mean</text>
  <text start="1228.71" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s not like every time I turn around</text>
  <text start="1230.06" dur="7.08">wow there&amp;#39;s just like some manifestation</text>
  <text start="1232.82" dur="6.15">of glory like there was you know I wish</text>
  <text start="1237.14" dur="3.96">I wish it was that way but I believe</text>
  <text start="1238.97" dur="5.55">that God is collectively taking the body</text>
  <text start="1241.1" dur="5.1">forward and I think we&amp;#39;re all on the</text>
  <text start="1244.52" dur="4.71">shadow unto the pole I mean let&amp;#39;s take a</text>
  <text start="1246.2" dur="4.59">simple simple example is obesity okay</text>
  <text start="1249.23" dur="4.68">obesity in the United States as I&amp;#39;m sure</text>
  <text start="1250.79" dur="6.2">you know is huge it is one of the major</text>
  <text start="1253.91" dur="5.88">problems and if you look at all of the</text>
  <text start="1256.99" dur="4.51">death related issues that obesity is</text>
  <text start="1259.79" dur="5.49">linked to you&amp;#39;ve got hypertension heart</text>
  <text start="1261.5" dur="5.67">disease diabetes neuropathy so like for</text>
  <text start="1265.28" dur="3.24">people that is about basically your</text>
  <text start="1267.17" dur="2.79">nerves stop working right in your</text>
  <text start="1268.52" dur="2.7">extremities so you get a bunch of pain</text>
  <text start="1269.96" dur="3.48">in your feet in your hands they stop</text>
  <text start="1271.22" dur="3.96">working right if you&amp;#39;re diabetic like</text>
  <text start="1273.44" dur="4.31">your feet basically get ulcers and then</text>
  <text start="1275.18" dur="5.94">fall off once you get into the diabetes</text>
  <text start="1277.75" dur="5.35">it is circling the drain with worse and</text>
  <text start="1281.12" dur="3.93">worse illnesses you get into kidney</text>
  <text start="1283.1" dur="4.41">failure you get into glaucoma you get</text>
  <text start="1285.05" dur="5.52">into peripheral vascular disease heart</text>
  <text start="1287.51" dur="5.28">failure but all of that stems from too</text>
  <text start="1290.57" dur="4.26">much weight I mean if you had to take a</text>
  <text start="1292.79" dur="5.07">lot of that back to its primary issue</text>
  <text start="1294.83" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s from being overweight and not to</text>
  <text start="1297.86" dur="4.26">harp on people being overweight because</text>
  <text start="1299.48" dur="4.05">I have a lot of compassion for for</text>
  <text start="1302.12" dur="5.13">people that have difficulty losing</text>
  <text start="1303.53" dur="5.28">weight it can be very hard but the point</text>
  <text start="1307.25" dur="4.23">remains that even when we have people</text>
  <text start="1308.81" dur="3.99">preaching about divine health if you</text>
  <text start="1311.48" dur="2.88">look at a lot of the people who are</text>
  <text start="1312.8" dur="4.38">preaching and teaching on divine health</text>
  <text start="1314.36" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re not exactly thin themselves and</text>
  <text start="1317.18" dur="5.07">the reason I say that is is not to poke</text>
  <text start="1320.57" dur="3.63">fun at anybody it&amp;#39;s that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1322.25" dur="3.66">something we&amp;#39;re missing in the</text>
  <text start="1324.2" dur="3.6">manifestation of the life of Christ in</text>
  <text start="1325.91" dur="3.99">our lives because if we were walking it</text>
  <text start="1327.8" dur="5.52">out and living it out to the extent that</text>
  <text start="1329.9" dur="5.13">I think we could then I believe that it</text>
  <text start="1333.32" dur="3.81">would be manifesting in our own bodies</text>
  <text start="1335.03" dur="3.87">at a higher level and and the reason I</text>
  <text start="1337.13" dur="3.84">pickle bisa T is because it&amp;#39;s visible</text>
  <text start="1338.9" dur="4.74">from the outside like it&amp;#39;s not something</text>
  <text start="1340.97" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not very subjective it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="1343.64" dur="2.73">of an objective thing that you could</text>
  <text start="1344.93" dur="4.23">just see by looking at people that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1346.37" dur="5.67">that makes sense and it&amp;#39;s so connected</text>
  <text start="1349.16" dur="4.35">with health problems and so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1352.04" dur="3.03">think it&amp;#39;s just I mean yeah there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1353.51" dur="2.22">measure okay maybe we need some diet</text>
  <text start="1355.07" dur="2.25">change or so</text>
  <text start="1355.73" dur="3.54">thing or exercise but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1357.32" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s all of it because those are all</text>
  <text start="1359.27" dur="4.68">natural solutions to a natural problem</text>
  <text start="1361.55" dur="4.68">and we&amp;#39;re talking about a supernatural</text>
  <text start="1363.95" dur="3.84">God who supernaturally gives us abundant</text>
  <text start="1366.23" dur="4.2">life so I believe there have to be a</text>
  <text start="1367.79" dur="5.31">supernatural manifestation that keeps us</text>
  <text start="1370.43" dur="4.95">healthy regardless of whether we have</text>
  <text start="1373.1" dur="4.71">access to the healthiest raw fresh vegan</text>
  <text start="1375.38" dur="4.89">organic food or not you know what I mean</text>
  <text start="1377.81" dur="4.35">yep I agree with you well and this is</text>
  <text start="1380.27" dur="4.4">where you start getting into things that</text>
  <text start="1382.16" dur="5.25">people don&amp;#39;t talk much about in</text>
  <text start="1384.67" dur="6.1">especially in mainline churches things</text>
  <text start="1387.41" dur="5.64">like healing DNA I had a dream not too</text>
  <text start="1390.77" dur="6.42">long ago where the Lord told me that</text>
  <text start="1393.05" dur="7.35">Denise needs healing of her DNA to get</text>
  <text start="1397.19" dur="6.81">healed of gluten intolerance Adam came</text>
  <text start="1400.4" dur="6.93">into the earth with intact perfect DNA</text>
  <text start="1404" dur="5.73">from the father and ever since then the</text>
  <text start="1407.33" dur="4.59">enemy has been corrupting our DNA</text>
  <text start="1409.73" dur="4.65">corrupting the seed and every generation</text>
  <text start="1411.92" dur="5.64">that comes out farther from Adam is a</text>
  <text start="1414.38" dur="5.76">one more level of magnitude off on our</text>
  <text start="1417.56" dur="4.68">DNA so we&amp;#39;re developing more and more</text>
  <text start="1420.14" dur="3.78">health problems because our DNA is</text>
  <text start="1422.24" dur="3.57">getting more screwed up as time goes on</text>
  <text start="1423.92" dur="3.87">and I think that&amp;#39;s one of the things</text>
  <text start="1425.81" dur="4.02">that in the realm of healing and</text>
  <text start="1427.79" dur="3.48">miracles in the next few years I think</text>
  <text start="1429.83" dur="2.67">there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot more</text>
  <text start="1431.27" dur="3.66">understanding that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1432.5" dur="4.71">receive on healing things like</text>
  <text start="1434.93" dur="3.81">generational issues and DNA problems and</text>
  <text start="1437.21" dur="3.42">hopefully that will take care of some of</text>
  <text start="1438.74" dur="4.17">the things like obesity and hereditary</text>
  <text start="1440.63" dur="4.83">problems oh and I think it will I mean</text>
  <text start="1442.91" dur="4.47">because the thing is even with some of</text>
  <text start="1445.46" dur="3.48">the the toxins and just things in our</text>
  <text start="1447.38" dur="4.32">environment and atmosphere you know</text>
  <text start="1448.94" dur="4.23">sauce from cars plastic and food just</text>
  <text start="1451.7" dur="5.58">all of that stuff it&amp;#39;s all there</text>
  <text start="1453.17" dur="6.69">whatever but our bodies you know are</text>
  <text start="1457.28" dur="4.35">amazingly created by God to heal and to</text>
  <text start="1459.86" dur="4.17">fix that kind of stuff so it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1461.63" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re saying once we get the the things</text>
  <text start="1464.03" dur="2.28">in place that are supposed to fix</text>
  <text start="1465.71" dur="2.76">everything</text>
  <text start="1466.31" dur="4.5">once they&amp;#39;re working right once the DNA</text>
  <text start="1468.47" dur="4.89">is telling our bodies what to do</text>
  <text start="1470.81" dur="4.02">properly our bodies are able to fix</text>
  <text start="1473.36" dur="3.63">those things and compensate and adjust</text>
  <text start="1474.83" dur="3.99">for them better than they are right now</text>
  <text start="1476.99" dur="3.93">if you think about it that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1478.82" dur="5.7">issue that sin causes as a whole like in</text>
  <text start="1480.92" dur="6.63">Romans 3:23 it says that the wages of</text>
  <text start="1484.52" dur="4.869">sin is death well the whole issue is</text>
  <text start="1487.55" dur="3.129">that sin causes death</text>
  <text start="1489.389" dur="3.15">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s kind of this</text>
  <text start="1490.679" dur="4.17">manifestation over time that we&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1492.539" dur="5.52">is it&amp;#39;s not like sin causes immediate</text>
  <text start="1494.849" dur="5.55">and instantaneous death John G Lake</text>
  <text start="1498.059" dur="4.05">talked about how sickness he said his</text>
  <text start="1500.399" dur="3.301">incipient death incipient means</text>
  <text start="1502.109" dur="4.92">gradually leading up to</text>
  <text start="1503.7" dur="5.759">so basically sickness is death that is</text>
  <text start="1507.029" dur="4.02">in the process of manifesting fully that</text>
  <text start="1509.459" dur="3.3">just hasn&amp;#39;t completely come to fruition</text>
  <text start="1511.049" dur="4.2">yet so it&amp;#39;s almost like you plant the</text>
  <text start="1512.759" dur="5.04">seed of death and then it&amp;#39;s growing into</text>
  <text start="1515.249" dur="4.77">a tree that tree blossoms and then bears</text>
  <text start="1517.799" dur="4.5">fruit and then you die but but the</text>
  <text start="1520.019" dur="4.171">problem with sickness is sickness is the</text>
  <text start="1522.299" dur="3.12">part where the the trees about a foot</text>

  <text start="1533.369" dur="3.96">because of because of your lifestyle or</text>
  <text start="1536.009" dur="3.27">because that&amp;#39;s part of the problem</text>
  <text start="1537.329" dur="4.38">though is because we&amp;#39;ve gotten used to</text>
  <text start="1539.279" dur="4.171">this incipient death I mean that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1541.709" dur="3.361">normal in our minds you know that&amp;#39;s why</text>

  <text start="1561.119" dur="3.331">me well enough to know that that I</text>
  <text start="1562.589" dur="4.29">believe that the end goal is actually</text>
  <text start="1564.45" dur="4.939">never dying so for me resurrection is</text>
  <text start="1566.879" dur="6.09">even kind of a step in in a road that</text>
  <text start="1569.389" dur="5.17">goes on even further than that but if we</text>
  <text start="1572.969" dur="3.75">believe that God wants us to live an</text>
  <text start="1574.559" dur="3.42">abundant life jesus said in John 10:10</text>
  <text start="1576.719" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;ve come that you might have life and</text>
  <text start="1577.979" dur="3.961">have it more abundantly then it has to</text>
  <text start="1579.989" dur="3.42">look like something which means when</text>
  <text start="1581.94" dur="4.26">people are getting old getting frail</text>
  <text start="1583.409" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;re dying there has to be a solution</text>
  <text start="1586.2" dur="4.259">for that problem because no part of</text>
  <text start="1587.94" dur="5.01">death is abundant life the Bible says</text>
  <text start="1590.459" dur="4.62">that the last enemy to be destroyed is</text>
  <text start="1592.95" dur="4.379">death so in the same sentence we have a</text>
  <text start="1595.079" dur="4.2">death equals enemy Jesus is coming till</text>
  <text start="1597.329" dur="3.39">he places everything under his feet well</text>
  <text start="1599.279" dur="3.39">death is a thing therefore it&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="1600.719" dur="4.26">placed under his feet he came to destroy</text>
  <text start="1602.669" dur="3.96">he took over the power of death Helen</text>
  <text start="1604.979" dur="4.77">the grave so Jesus took dominion over</text>
  <text start="1606.629" dur="4.95">those things now Jesus came to seek and</text>
  <text start="1609.749" dur="4.201">save that which was lost well what is</text>
  <text start="1611.579" dur="5.491">the very first thing we lost in the</text>
  <text start="1613.95" dur="4.769">Garden of Eden exactly right yeah and if</text>
  <text start="1617.07" dur="3.029">you eat of this he&amp;#39;ll die it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1618.719" dur="3.651">sorry if you just look through the</text>
  <text start="1620.099" dur="5.451">Gospels and look at the</text>
  <text start="1622.37" dur="7.25">way Jesus viewed life and death and</text>
  <text start="1625.55" dur="6.57">don&amp;#39;t frame it in in the context of what</text>
  <text start="1629.62" dur="5.68">mainline Christianity teaches but just</text>
  <text start="1632.12" dur="5.73">take Jesus at literally at his word how</text>
  <text start="1635.3" dur="4.89">he says anyone who believes in Me shall</text>
  <text start="1637.85" dur="4.05">not die they&amp;#39;ll have eternal life okay</text>
  <text start="1640.19" dur="3.06">what does that mean literally that</text>
  <text start="1641.9" dur="5.55">literally means you&amp;#39;re never going to</text>
  <text start="1643.25" dur="6.57">die yeah and we say you know we say no</text>
  <text start="1647.45" dur="4.59">no he&amp;#39;s talking about spiritual life not</text>
  <text start="1649.82" dur="5.07">physical life oh heavens no we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="1652.04" dur="4.26">gonna die physically but if you look at</text>
  <text start="1654.89" dur="4.83">what he says over and over again</text>
  <text start="1656.3" dur="5.82">he doesn&amp;#39;t say spiritual life he just</text>
  <text start="1659.72" dur="4.43">says you will never die it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1662.12" dur="5.58">difficult people don&amp;#39;t understand how</text>
  <text start="1664.15" dur="6.63">difficult it is to say that Jesus did</text>
  <text start="1667.7" dur="6.81">not teach that we should live forever</text>
  <text start="1670.78" dur="6.85">that he came to destroy death that he</text>
  <text start="1674.51" dur="5.549">came to defeat death that life is our</text>
  <text start="1677.63" dur="7.049">inheritance and we just have kind of</text>
  <text start="1680.059" dur="6.721">accepted death as inevitable and Jesus</text>
  <text start="1684.679" dur="5.071">all throughout the Bible teaches that</text>
  <text start="1686.78" dur="5.85">death is not inevitable that&amp;#39;s the enemy</text>
  <text start="1689.75" dur="5.58">and I&amp;#39;ve defeated it so I we have these</text>
  <text start="1692.63" dur="4.29">discussions and you are a lot farther</text>
  <text start="1695.33" dur="3.72">down the road than I am I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="1696.92" dur="3.87">wrestling with the whole yeah but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1699.05" dur="3.93">never met anybody who&amp;#39;s 500 years old</text>
  <text start="1700.79" dur="4.8">you know that&amp;#39;s the thing that I</text>
  <text start="1702.98" dur="4.02">struggle with but my thought is and this</text>
  <text start="1705.59" dur="3.45">is this is kind of where I go with that</text>
  <text start="1707" dur="4.38">is have you met anybody who has had</text>
  <text start="1709.04" dur="3.36">leaves of the tree of life appeared to</text>
  <text start="1711.38" dur="2.85">them and they&amp;#39;ve eaten them and gotten</text>
  <text start="1712.4" dur="7.05">healed of something oh sure throw that</text>
  <text start="1714.23" dur="7.35">in my face no no no no I think I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1719.45" dur="4.68">giving you a bad time on it that kind of</text>
  <text start="1721.58" dur="6.66">thing is what I would expect if God is</text>
  <text start="1724.13" dur="5.91">going to give us a key to eternal life I</text>
  <text start="1728.24" dur="3.75">would expect him to do that I would</text>
  <text start="1730.04" dur="4.769">expect him to say to me in a dream one</text>
  <text start="1731.99" dur="4.77">time hey so you know that tree that when</text>
  <text start="1734.809" dur="4.081">you eat the leaves of it it is for the</text>
  <text start="1736.76" dur="4.14">healing of the nations and yeah so I</text>
  <text start="1738.89" dur="3.84">want you to eat some of the leaves from</text>
  <text start="1740.9" dur="4.02">this tree because I want you to live</text>
  <text start="1742.73" dur="4.14">forever that&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that I</text>
  <text start="1744.92" dur="5.1">would almost expect God to teach me</text>
  <text start="1746.87" dur="5.49">about in this discovery of eternal life</text>
  <text start="1750.02" dur="5.37">and immortality I haven&amp;#39;t run across the</text>
  <text start="1752.36" dur="3.75">head though yeah I have I have had some</text>
  <text start="1755.39" dur="2.73">very interest</text>
  <text start="1756.11" dur="4.29">dreams that speak on that subject I just</text>
  <text start="1758.12" dur="10.29">have kind of filed them away because</text>
  <text start="1760.4" dur="10.74">they make me uncomfortable but I mean</text>
  <text start="1768.41" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s one of those things and I think the</text>
  <text start="1771.14" dur="3.3">thing that gets me and it&amp;#39;s around the</text>
  <text start="1773.12" dur="3.689">whole subject of life and death and</text>
  <text start="1774.44" dur="3.51">immortality I was taught you know my</text>
  <text start="1776.809" dur="3.031">dad&amp;#39;s an Episcopal priest</text>
  <text start="1777.95" dur="4.74">and I was always taught you know heaven</text>
  <text start="1779.84" dur="5.85">when you die and I&amp;#39;m not anti heaven but</text>
  <text start="1782.69" dur="5.76">the problem is death is not a form of</text>
  <text start="1785.69" dur="5.1">healing and and that is one of the most</text>
  <text start="1788.45" dur="3.75">irritating heresies to me and I call it</text>
  <text start="1790.79" dur="3.06">a heresy because that&amp;#39;s what it is death</text>
  <text start="1792.2" dur="4.95">is not a form of healing your body has</text>
  <text start="1793.85" dur="4.05">to fail everything has to break down for</text>
  <text start="1797.15" dur="2.22">you to die</text>
  <text start="1797.9" dur="4.11">you can&amp;#39;t die if you&amp;#39;re healthy it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1799.37" dur="3.45">physically impossible you don&amp;#39;t healthy</text>
  <text start="1802.01" dur="2.31">people do not die</text>
  <text start="1802.82" dur="2.91">oh well good they got hit by a car well</text>
  <text start="1804.32" dur="3.39">right at that moment they got hit by a</text>
  <text start="1805.73" dur="3.36">car they stopped being healthy like</text>
  <text start="1807.71" dur="3.24">right they went into a multi-system</text>
  <text start="1809.09" dur="4.68">organ failure in the next two minutes</text>
  <text start="1810.95" dur="4.77">which is why they died exactly like like</text>
  <text start="1813.77" dur="4.62">their brain got smashed in four seconds</text>
  <text start="1815.72" dur="4.5">like whatever it is they died because in</text>
  <text start="1818.39" dur="3.72">that moment they instantaneously through</text>
  <text start="1820.22" dur="3.99">a traumatic event became unhealthy you</text>
  <text start="1822.11" dur="4.83">can&amp;#39;t be healthy and die they are</text>
  <text start="1824.21" dur="4.469">mutually exclusive you Jesus Jesus was</text>
  <text start="1826.94" dur="4.229">very clear he actually said you know I</text>
  <text start="1828.679" dur="4.471">am the door I am the gate you know they</text>
  <text start="1831.169" dur="3.931">said in John 14 you know Lord we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1833.15" dur="4.2">know how to get to where you&amp;#39;re going he</text>
  <text start="1835.1" dur="3.6">said you come with me he said follow me</text>
  <text start="1837.35" dur="2.67">to the where I&amp;#39;m going is there like</text>
  <text start="1838.7" dur="3.09">Lord we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t know the way</text>
  <text start="1840.02" dur="4.409">you&amp;#39;re going he said I am the way</text>
  <text start="1841.79" dur="4.379">alright in John 10 or 11 he goes on to</text>
  <text start="1844.429" dur="4.081">say I am the door I am the gate for the</text>
  <text start="1846.169" dur="4.38">Sheep well you can either have death be</text>
  <text start="1848.51" dur="4.5">the door or you can have Jesus be your</text>
  <text start="1850.549" dur="5.191">door but you can&amp;#39;t have both so you have</text>
  <text start="1853.01" dur="4.409">to pick between Jesus and death as to</text>
  <text start="1855.74" dur="4.2">which one&amp;#39;s going to be your door we</text>
  <text start="1857.419" dur="5.281">have examples of Enoch and Elijah who</text>
  <text start="1859.94" dur="5.82">chose Jesus as the door and everybody</text>
  <text start="1862.7" dur="5.79">else just dies well if Jesus is</text>
  <text start="1865.76" dur="4.68">anti-death death is an enemy then he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1868.49" dur="4.439">already shown us in Scripture that there</text>
  <text start="1870.44" dur="3.84">is another way then that&amp;#39;s the way we</text>
  <text start="1872.929" dur="2.911">need to be going I&amp;#39;m not saying we can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1874.28" dur="3.899">go to heaven I&amp;#39;m just saying you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1875.84" dur="3.66">die to go to heaven well I think the</text>
  <text start="1878.179" dur="4.411">point is we should be going to heaven</text>
  <text start="1879.5" dur="7.26">right now that - right but you know</text>
  <text start="1882.59" dur="5.52">every day we are but I mean I&amp;#39;m even</text>
  <text start="1886.76" dur="2.73">saying for people who are like oh well</text>
  <text start="1888.11" dur="2.64">I&amp;#39;d like to be in heaven or not the</text>
  <text start="1889.49" dur="3">the earth anymore that&amp;#39;s fine live a</text>
  <text start="1890.75" dur="3.87">couple hundred years and then pop off to</text>
  <text start="1892.49" dur="3.51">heaven like Enoch and Elijah but but the</text>
  <text start="1894.62" dur="3.27">thing is you can&amp;#39;t you&amp;#39;re not allowed to</text>
  <text start="1896" dur="5.13">die to do it according to the Scriptures</text>
  <text start="1897.89" dur="5.07">according to God because because even</text>
  <text start="1901.13" dur="3.45">the thing that God came to prevent he</text>
  <text start="1902.96" dur="3.99">came to Jesus came to seek and save that</text>
  <text start="1904.58" dur="4.08">which was lost and that&amp;#39;s why Jesus went</text>
  <text start="1906.95" dur="2.91">around doing good healing all who were</text>
  <text start="1908.66" dur="2.7">oppressed to the devil he went around</text>
  <text start="1909.86" dur="4.17">raising the dead he commanded his</text>
  <text start="1911.36" dur="4.98">disciples in Matthew 10 verse 8 to do</text>
  <text start="1914.03" dur="4.14">the same because he&amp;#39;s anti death he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1916.34" dur="3.8">against destruction he&amp;#39;s against death</text>
  <text start="1918.17" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s against all of the things that are</text>
  <text start="1920.14" dur="6.64">opposed to his will the thing is when</text>
  <text start="1924.11" dur="7.05">you see what is happening in the garden</text>
  <text start="1926.78" dur="7.68">it was obvious that God&amp;#39;s plans for</text>
  <text start="1931.16" dur="6.12">mankind did not include death death was</text>
  <text start="1934.46" dur="5.219">a plan that the enemy brought in it</text>
  <text start="1937.28" dur="4.14">wasn&amp;#39;t part of God&amp;#39;s plan in order for</text>
  <text start="1939.679" dur="5.161">you to arrive at some kind of a theology</text>
  <text start="1941.42" dur="6.33">that says that God&amp;#39;s plan for us is to</text>
  <text start="1944.84" dur="4.98">physically die you have to go down some</text>
  <text start="1947.75" dur="4.98">pretty strange roads because that it</text>
  <text start="1949.82" dur="4.739">really has never been God&amp;#39;s plan for us</text>
  <text start="1952.73" dur="3.329">to die physically but one of the</text>
  <text start="1954.559" dur="3.211">problems and this is where we&amp;#39;re I</text>
  <text start="1956.059" dur="4.651">believe mind renewal is so key in this</text>
  <text start="1957.77" dur="4.62">is we have developed a very keen</text>
  <text start="1960.71" dur="3.75">theology that tells us that not only</text>
  <text start="1962.39" dur="3.63">does God want us to die but that he</text>
  <text start="1964.46" dur="3.41">kills certain people at certain times</text>
  <text start="1966.02" dur="4.49">certain places and in certain ways and</text>
  <text start="1967.87" dur="5.02">the reason that&amp;#39;s an issue is because</text>
  <text start="1970.51" dur="4.419">the moment you start believing that God</text>
  <text start="1972.89" dur="4.32">kills people it&amp;#39;s really hard to know</text>
  <text start="1974.929" dur="3.931">when you&amp;#39;re in front of a dead body does</text>
  <text start="1977.21" dur="3.75">God want this person dead like did he</text>
  <text start="1978.86" dur="3.9">kill this one or am I supposed to bring</text>
  <text start="1980.96" dur="3.57">him back because you know if if they</text>
  <text start="1982.76" dur="3.33">died and I&amp;#39;m supposed to bring them back</text>
  <text start="1984.53" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s fine we want to pray into God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1986.09" dur="4.44">will but if God took them home</text>
  <text start="1988.37" dur="3.66">ie if God killed them like let&amp;#39;s take</text>
  <text start="1990.53" dur="2.88">the pretty flowery language out of it</text>
  <text start="1992.03" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s really what you&amp;#39;re saying so</text>
  <text start="1993.41" dur="4.89">either God kills people and you</text>
  <text start="1996.08" dur="3.54">shouldn&amp;#39;t raise them and then you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1998.3" dur="2.73">operate out of protocol because you</text>
  <text start="1999.62" dur="4.14">don&amp;#39;t know what God wants because there</text>
  <text start="2001.03" dur="5.55">is no protocol in the situation or you</text>
  <text start="2003.76" dur="4.83">can because God doesn&amp;#39;t kill people but</text>
  <text start="2006.58" dur="4.38">the Old Testament has tons of references</text>
  <text start="2008.59" dur="5.25">where it seems like God kills people and</text>
  <text start="2010.96" dur="5.31">that&amp;#39;s what trips people up obviously</text>
  <text start="2013.84" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s true because if you look at at</text>
  <text start="2016.27" dur="3.99">the Old Testament where God seemed to be</text>
  <text start="2018.97" dur="4.05">smiting just about everybody who got</text>
  <text start="2020.26" dur="3.12">near him and then you know Jesus shows</text>
  <text start="2023.02" dur="1.68">up</text>
  <text start="2023.38" dur="2.58">the scene in the Gospels and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2024.7" dur="3.09">raising all these people from the dead</text>
  <text start="2025.96" dur="5.01">and healing everyone you know like okay</text>
  <text start="2027.79" dur="5.28">wait a minute what&amp;#39;s going on here and</text>
  <text start="2030.97" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s just it is we have to reinterpret</text>
  <text start="2033.07" dur="5.1">like I believe the Bible we need to</text>
  <text start="2035.65" dur="3.9">start reading it with Jesus and</text>
  <text start="2038.17" dur="3.81">everything else</text>
  <text start="2039.55" dur="5.34">forward and backward around that becomes</text>
  <text start="2041.98" dur="5.1">subservient and secondary to the perfect</text>
  <text start="2044.89" dur="4.44">revelation of Jesus Christ and how he</text>
  <text start="2047.08" dur="3.9">reveals the Father and that&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="2049.33" dur="3.66">sketchy for some people to hear and to</text>
  <text start="2050.98" dur="3.54">say because yes I am prioritizing some</text>
  <text start="2052.99" dur="4.02">of the Bible over other parts of the</text>
  <text start="2054.52" dur="4.139">Bible I believe that Jesus is the exact</text>
  <text start="2057.01" dur="3.18">representation of God&amp;#39;s glory Hebrews</text>
  <text start="2058.659" dur="4.141">1:3 sustains all things by his powerful</text>
  <text start="2060.19" dur="4.709">word he and the father are exactly the</text>
  <text start="2062.8" dur="3.66">same they&amp;#39;re you know he&amp;#39;s in the image</text>
  <text start="2064.899" dur="3.601">of the father what that means is he&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="2066.46" dur="5.04">exact copy he&amp;#39;s alike they are the same</text>
  <text start="2068.5" dur="6.57">Jesus himself said in John 17 I and the</text>
  <text start="2071.5" dur="3.929">father are one that means one it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2075.07" dur="2.46">mean</text>
  <text start="2075.429" dur="4.95">two people will like it means they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2077.53" dur="4.77">literally one so if Jesus and the father</text>
  <text start="2080.379" dur="4.141">are the same then you can&amp;#39;t have Jesus</text>
  <text start="2082.3" dur="3.96">being this nice lovey guy who raised his</text>
  <text start="2084.52" dur="3.57">people from the dead and God being this</text>
  <text start="2086.26" dur="3.21">Zeus like figure he&amp;#39;s about to smite you</text>
  <text start="2088.09" dur="3.39">with the lightning bolt if you step out</text>
  <text start="2089.47" dur="5.31">wrong like Ananias and Sapphira will</text>
  <text start="2091.48" dur="4.949">Ananias lied death to you okay so does</text>
  <text start="2094.78" dur="4.14">everybody who lies deserve to die like</text>
  <text start="2096.429" dur="4.201">how&amp;#39;s that work and that&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="2098.92" dur="4.83">thing is we have this schizophrenic view</text>
  <text start="2100.63" dur="5.7">of God because we have really</text>
  <text start="2103.75" dur="4.59">schizophrenic view of the Bible and I</text>
  <text start="2106.33" dur="4.59">would suggest that because we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2108.34" dur="4.44">understand some kind of key important</text>
  <text start="2110.92" dur="5.49">details about how the Bible was written</text>
  <text start="2112.78" dur="5.04">and who was writing it and their</text>
  <text start="2116.41" dur="4.83">perspective as they wrote it that it</text>
  <text start="2117.82" dur="5.52">totally changes the way we we read when</text>
  <text start="2121.24" dur="3.45">we read they got killed people well let</text>
  <text start="2123.34" dur="4.77">me kind of interject something here</text>
  <text start="2124.69" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with emphasizing</text>
  <text start="2128.11" dur="4.65">some parts of the scriptures over others</text>
  <text start="2129.97" dur="6.69">some parts of the Bible are more</text>
  <text start="2132.76" dur="7.2">important than others jesus said and</text>
  <text start="2136.66" dur="5.07">this is in matthew 23:23 he said to the</text>
  <text start="2139.96" dur="4.53">scribes and Pharisees when he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2141.73" dur="5.4">basically reaming them out woe to you</text>
  <text start="2144.49" dur="5.27">scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you</text>
  <text start="2147.13" dur="7.11">pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin</text>
  <text start="2149.76" dur="7.36">but have neglected the weightier the</text>
  <text start="2154.24" dur="5.43">weightier the heavier the more poor</text>
  <text start="2157.12" dur="4.98">matters of the law which our justice and</text>
  <text start="2159.67" dur="3.84">mercy and faith these you should have</text>
  <text start="2162.1" dur="3.48">done without leaving the other things</text>
  <text start="2163.51" dur="3.48">undone so what the Pharisees inscribes</text>
  <text start="2165.58" dur="2.76">are doing was they were picking out the</text>
  <text start="2166.99" dur="3.84">little parts of the Scriptures that they</text>
  <text start="2168.34" dur="4.41">wanted to obey and ignoring the more</text>
  <text start="2170.83" dur="4.56">important the more serious the way to</text>
  <text start="2172.75" dur="3.27">your matters and Jesus kind of nails</text>
  <text start="2175.39" dur="2.16">them on it</text>
  <text start="2176.02" dur="4.68">there are things in the scriptures that</text>
  <text start="2177.55" dur="5.1">I think are more significant and more</text>
  <text start="2180.7" dur="3.84">important and things that are less</text>
  <text start="2182.65" dur="3.33">significant and less important again</text>
  <text start="2184.54" dur="3.99">when you look through the Gospels and</text>
  <text start="2185.98" dur="4.05">you look at what Jesus is doing healing</text>
  <text start="2188.53" dur="2.01">the sick raising the dead casting out</text>
  <text start="2190.03" dur="3.38">demons</text>
  <text start="2190.54" dur="6.57">those become the weightier matters and</text>
  <text start="2193.41" dur="7.72">other things like tithing become not</text>
  <text start="2197.11" dur="6.03">quite so important right I think it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="2201.13" dur="3.66">true and I mean it comes down it really</text>
  <text start="2203.14" dur="3.45">does come down to a redefinition of God</text>
  <text start="2204.79" dur="3.51">and it&amp;#39;s not a redefinition of God in a</text>
  <text start="2206.59" dur="3.21">sense of oh we&amp;#39;re gonna create a brand</text>
  <text start="2208.3" dur="3.93">new God in our own image we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2209.8" dur="5.13">just throw out certain scriptures all of</text>
  <text start="2212.23" dur="4.71">the scriptures can stay fine but some of</text>
  <text start="2214.93" dur="4.29">them are translated poorly that&amp;#39;s a fact</text>
  <text start="2216.94" dur="4.8">some of them could be translated</text>
  <text start="2219.22" dur="6.06">multiple ways and because translation is</text>
  <text start="2221.74" dur="5.73">not it&amp;#39;s not a science it&amp;#39;s an art the</text>
  <text start="2225.28" dur="5.04">translator whoever is translating it has</text>
  <text start="2227.47" dur="4.68">to make critical choices depending on</text>
  <text start="2230.32" dur="5.04">the words of translating I speak to and</text>
  <text start="2232.15" dur="4.65">a little bit of third language so like I</text>
  <text start="2235.36" dur="3.78">understand depending on when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2236.8" dur="3.87">translating something you know from one</text>
  <text start="2239.14" dur="3.24">language to another there&amp;#39;s not always a</text>
  <text start="2240.67" dur="3.78">good way to say one word and so I have</text>
  <text start="2242.38" dur="4.68">to use multiple words to say that same</text>
  <text start="2244.45" dur="5.19">concept or object or whatever in a</text>
  <text start="2247.06" dur="4.53">different language so sometimes you have</text>
  <text start="2249.64" dur="3.72">to communicate something differently</text>
  <text start="2251.59" dur="3.18">because the language just doesn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="2253.36" dur="2.76">doesn&amp;#39;t have the right way to say it</text>
  <text start="2254.77" dur="3.99">when you put it from one language to</text>
  <text start="2256.12" dur="7.08">another so there are a lot of phrases</text>
  <text start="2258.76" dur="6.15">and ideas and idioms in the Greek that</text>
  <text start="2263.2" dur="3.72">we do not have an ink in English</text>
  <text start="2264.91" dur="4.74">equivalent for there are a lot of ideas</text>
  <text start="2266.92" dur="5.22">in French and German and other languages</text>
  <text start="2269.65" dur="4.95">that do not translate into English and</text>
  <text start="2272.14" dur="5.67">the same is true in Chinese and Japanese</text>
  <text start="2274.6" dur="5.25">there are some concepts that just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2277.81" dur="4.98">translate into other languages very well</text>
  <text start="2279.85" dur="4.92">all you get as a close approximation and</text>
  <text start="2282.79" dur="3.78">it doesn&amp;#39;t really capture the idea yeah</text>
  <text start="2284.77" dur="3.9">well like in Spanish an easy example is</text>
  <text start="2286.57" dur="4.049">el mundo es una pañuelo it means the</text>
  <text start="2288.67" dur="4.889">world is handkerchief it basically me</text>
  <text start="2290.619" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s a small world but it&amp;#39;s a small</text>
  <text start="2293.559" dur="3.931">world is an English term the worlds as a</text>
  <text start="2295.809" dur="4.02">handkerchief it&amp;#39;s a small item but</text>
  <text start="2297.49" dur="3.779">that&amp;#39;s a phrase and in Spanish well but</text>
  <text start="2299.829" dur="2.581">I mean it doesn&amp;#39;t translate well what do</text>
  <text start="2301.269" dur="2.82">you mean the world&amp;#39;s a handkerchief like</text>
  <text start="2302.41" dur="3.689">is that some metaphor like yes it is a</text>
  <text start="2304.089" dur="2.91">metaphor but if you don&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="2306.099" dur="2.851">saying it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="2306.999" dur="10.76">whatsoever right and we always remember</text>
  <text start="2308.95" dur="8.809">a metaphor is like a simile it&amp;#39;s amazing</text>
  <text start="2324.119" dur="5.591">I mean that&amp;#39;s the reason that&amp;#39;s key is</text>
  <text start="2327.49" dur="5.64">because when we look at scriptures that</text>
  <text start="2329.71" dur="4.799">we say this means this well sometimes it</text>
  <text start="2333.13" dur="3.389">means that except when it doesn&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="2334.509" dur="3.84">the only way you can know that is when</text>
  <text start="2336.519" dur="5.961">you go back like I like blue letter</text>
  <text start="2338.349" dur="7.47">Bible dot-org is my friend I love</text>
  <text start="2342.48" dur="5.079">because you can look up the exact actual</text>
  <text start="2345.819" dur="3.631">words and Greek and Hebrew see what they</text>
  <text start="2347.559" dur="4.23">mean it gives you like lists of the</text>
  <text start="2349.45" dur="4.47">varying like meanings it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="2351.789" dur="4.95">reading into the Amplified Bible except</text>
  <text start="2353.92" dur="5.52">you can see where the Amplified Bible</text>
  <text start="2356.739" dur="4.8">got the pregnant meaning it has like</text>
  <text start="2359.44" dur="3.899">it&amp;#39;s much more clear than just reading a</text>
  <text start="2361.539" dur="3.3">verse in the amplified and the reason I</text>
  <text start="2363.339" dur="3.121">like reading is because it tells me when</text>
  <text start="2364.839" dur="3.24">I I I feel like God&amp;#39;s giving you a</text>
  <text start="2366.46" dur="3.629">revelation about something in scripture</text>
  <text start="2368.079" dur="3.72">I&amp;#39;ll go back and check it in a blue</text>
  <text start="2370.089" dur="5.25">letter Bible check out the Greek and say</text>
  <text start="2371.799" dur="5.55">does it really say or can it really say</text>
  <text start="2375.339" dur="4.5">I should say what what the Lord&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2377.349" dur="4.381">showing me and usually it does I mean</text>
  <text start="2379.839" dur="3.571">usually it is it can be interpreted one</text>
  <text start="2381.73" dur="3.629">of multiple ways the interpreter chose</text>
  <text start="2383.41" dur="4.23">it one way and what the Lord is telling</text>
  <text start="2385.359" dur="3.75">me is basically look this can be</text>
  <text start="2387.64" dur="3.599">correctly and accurately read a</text>
  <text start="2389.109" dur="4.531">different way and when you do read it a</text>
  <text start="2391.239" dur="4.53">different way it totally changes the</text>
  <text start="2393.64" dur="3.99">view you get of God when you read that</text>
  <text start="2395.769" dur="3.48">same verse because it says something</text>
  <text start="2397.63" dur="3.54">different like you have to actually</text>
  <text start="2399.249" dur="4.83">change words but you can change them</text>
  <text start="2401.17" dur="4.8">because it&amp;#39;s still correct to do that so</text>
  <text start="2404.079" dur="3.96">when you have God you know smiting</text>
  <text start="2405.97" dur="4.289">somebody in a situation you&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="2408.039" dur="4.83">situation where God actually isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2410.259" dur="5.1">smiting somebody you&amp;#39;ve got the devil</text>
  <text start="2412.869" dur="4.49">smiting somebody because the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="2415.359" dur="5.341">belief is that the devil worked for God</text>
  <text start="2417.359" dur="7.061">so you know in a situation where you</text>
  <text start="2420.7" dur="5.339">believe Satan&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s employee then</text>
  <text start="2424.42" dur="2.669">everything gets attributed to God</text>
  <text start="2426.039" dur="3.54">because God&amp;#39;s the owner of the company</text>
  <text start="2427.089" dur="6.301">right well and that&amp;#39;s part of the</text>
  <text start="2429.579" dur="6">problem with taking too much of your</text>
  <text start="2433.39" dur="4.199">theology from the Old Testament and the</text>
  <text start="2435.579" dur="5.401">problem there is Moses and the prophets</text>
  <text start="2437.589" dur="4.861">didn&amp;#39;t understand Satan and the kingdom</text>
  <text start="2440.98" dur="4.26">of darkness they didn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="2442.45" dur="5.3">demons they didn&amp;#39;t really have much of</text>
  <text start="2445.24" dur="4.95">understanding of how that all worked so</text>
  <text start="2447.75" dur="6.309">most of the Old Testament writers</text>
  <text start="2450.19" dur="6.78">attributed both death and life to God -</text>
  <text start="2454.059" dur="5.76">usually and Jesus comes along in John</text>
  <text start="2456.97" dur="5.43">10:10 and says hang on a minute guys I</text>
  <text start="2459.819" dur="5.851">have come that you may have life and</text>
  <text start="2462.4" dur="7.53">that more abundantly the enemy comes to</text>
  <text start="2465.67" dur="5.58">steal kill and destroy so he&amp;#39;s telling</text>
  <text start="2469.93" dur="1.83">people wait a minute there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="2471.25" dur="2.789">kingdoms</text>
  <text start="2471.76" dur="5.7">there&amp;#39;s the kingdom of darkness death</text>
  <text start="2474.039" dur="5.58">destruction sickness disease all right</text>
  <text start="2477.46" dur="5.069">there&amp;#39;s a kingdom of light that is life</text>
  <text start="2479.619" dur="4.95">and that more abundantly and that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2482.529" dur="4.83">representatives of one kingdom or the</text>
  <text start="2484.569" dur="5.341">other and so he goes and casts out</text>
  <text start="2487.359" dur="4.591">demons and heals the sick and raises the</text>
  <text start="2489.91" dur="5.31">dead to show his power and authority</text>
  <text start="2491.95" dur="4.74">over the kingdom of darkness and that</text>
  <text start="2495.22" dur="3.27">kind of messed up the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="2496.69" dur="3.389">theology for people who thought well God</text>
  <text start="2498.49" dur="3.75">was just into killing everybody hey you</text>
  <text start="2500.079" dur="4.29">live you die it&amp;#39;s all in God&amp;#39;s hands and</text>
  <text start="2502.24" dur="3.96">God kills some people for some reasons</text>
  <text start="2504.369" dur="3.39">and lets other people live and Jesus</text>
  <text start="2506.2" dur="3.119">really flipped that understanding upside</text>
  <text start="2507.759" dur="3.901">down he didn&amp;#39;t kill anybody</text>
  <text start="2509.319" dur="4.381">he went to funerals he raised people</text>
  <text start="2511.66" dur="3.54">from the dead and healed a lot of sick</text>
  <text start="2513.7" dur="4.859">people and cast out a lot of demons and</text>
  <text start="2515.2" dur="4.74">I think a lot of us still are struggling</text>
  <text start="2518.559" dur="5.97">to come up with a proper understanding</text>
  <text start="2519.94" dur="6.419">of the nature of God and his his kingdom</text>
  <text start="2524.529" dur="3.54">in the nature of the kingdom of darkness</text>
  <text start="2526.359" dur="3.841">for sure and it&amp;#39;s difficult because</text>
  <text start="2528.069" dur="3.661">we&amp;#39;ve all been taught a certain way and</text>
  <text start="2530.2" dur="2.849">we&amp;#39;re discovering more and more that the</text>
  <text start="2531.73" dur="3.599">way we&amp;#39;ve been taught just isn&amp;#39;t how it</text>
  <text start="2533.049" dur="4.171">is I mean that&amp;#39;s not a condemnation on</text>
  <text start="2535.329" dur="3.661">anybody because we&amp;#39;ve I think most of us</text>
  <text start="2537.22" dur="3.299">have learned it quote/unquote wrong and</text>

  <text start="2542.349" dur="5.071">advanced from where we started if you</text>
  <text start="2544.509" dur="5.701">think about Moses when Moses said to God</text>
