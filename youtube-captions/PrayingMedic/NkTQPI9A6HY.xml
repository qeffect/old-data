  <text start="194.51" dur="6.14">was the thing was messed up from from</text>
  <text start="196.16" dur="7.56">beginning to end it was obvious that</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="7.36">Menendez&amp;#39;s attorneys were trying to mess</text>
  <text start="203.72" dur="6.57">up the process they kept putting out</text>
  <text start="208.01" dur="6.449">these motions that the judge kept</text>
  <text start="210.29" dur="5.789">denying and the the attorneys had no</text>
  <text start="214.459" dur="3.891">other option and to try to get a</text>
  <text start="216.079" dur="8.791">mistrial and they were succeeded in it</text>
  <text start="218.35" dur="8.229">so so if you saw the congressional</text>
  <text start="224.87" dur="3.66">testimony this morning of Christopher</text>
  <text start="226.579" dur="4.38">Rea I didn&amp;#39;t find it terribly</text>
  <text start="228.53" dur="5.97">interesting I read his 13 page report</text>
  <text start="230.959" dur="4.891">that he sent to Congress yesterday it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="234.5" dur="2.85">on my Twitter timeline it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="235.85" dur="4.68">boring stuff it&amp;#39;s about all the</text>
  <text start="237.35" dur="6.479">different departments and programs in</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="6.48">the FBI and and what his philosophy is</text>
  <text start="243.829" dur="5.371">about you know structure and strategies</text>
  <text start="247.01" dur="3.93">and changes and challenges and all that</text>
  <text start="249.2" dur="5.159">stuff and it&amp;#39;s really I think it was</text>
  <text start="250.94" dur="5.22">really just kind of a status that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="254.359" dur="4.201">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on right now is</text>
  <text start="256.16" dur="5.1">these directors of the department&amp;#39;s have</text>
  <text start="258.56" dur="4.71">to go in to Congress once a year and</text>
  <text start="261.26" dur="3.85">give them kind of a State of the Union</text>
  <text start="263.27" dur="4.06">address well this is a state</text>
  <text start="265.11" dur="4.529">Department address sessions had to do it</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="3.69">Chris Wright had to do it all those</text>
  <text start="269.639" dur="3.481">other department heads they have to go</text>
  <text start="271.02" dur="4.5">into the congressional committees that</text>
  <text start="273.12" dur="4.139">do oversight and they have to give an</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="3.899">end-of-the-year report on what the</text>
  <text start="277.259" dur="4.53">department&amp;#39;s all about it just happens</text>
  <text start="279.419" dur="3.081">to be a place where if you are a</text>
  <text start="281.789" dur="2.85">politician</text>
  <text start="282.5" dur="4.289">yeah Neville Johnston&amp;#39;s had some</text>
  <text start="284.639" dur="4.861">interesting prophetic words too</text>
  <text start="286.789" dur="4.65">yeah so a lot of people now are aware</text>
  <text start="289.5" dur="3.84">that there is an inspector general oh</text>
  <text start="291.439" dur="4.211">wait a minute there&amp;#39;s an inspector</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="4.229">general as a person who&amp;#39;s actually you</text>
  <text start="295.65" dur="4.34">know kind of outside the department who</text>
  <text start="297.569" dur="5.25">comes in and does investigations and</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="5.59">we&amp;#39;ve I&amp;#39;ve been talking about that on my</text>
  <text start="302.819" dur="4.681">last three periscopes we talked about</text>
  <text start="305.58" dur="4.139">the Inspector General report that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="6.3">coming out quick most of the questions</text>
  <text start="309.719" dur="5.85">that went to Chris Rea he deferred to</text>
  <text start="313.8" dur="4.649">this inspector general report he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="315.569" dur="5.521">look I can&amp;#39;t tell you what is going on</text>
  <text start="318.449" dur="4.68">with Comey and Hillary and the</text>
  <text start="321.09" dur="3.47">investigation on stuff that&amp;#39;s all going</text>
  <text start="323.129" dur="6.78">to be in the inspector general&amp;#39;s report</text>
  <text start="324.56" dur="6.669">so you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of emotion and</text>
  <text start="329.909" dur="4.581">a lot of people really want to get</text>
  <text start="331.229" dur="6.69">information but you know Chris Rea</text>
  <text start="334.49" dur="4.929">wisely deferred all that to look the</text>
  <text start="337.919" dur="3.36">Inspector General&amp;#39;s report is coming out</text>
  <text start="339.419" dur="2.97">you&amp;#39;re gonna have to wait for it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="341.279" dur="4.021">gonna have to wait for it let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="342.389" dur="4.83">wait and see what comes out and you know</text>
  <text start="345.3" dur="5.66">I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not getting my hopes up</text>
  <text start="347.219" dur="7.44">about the Inspector General report but</text>
  <text start="350.96" dur="8.41">once that report comes out will at least</text>
  <text start="354.659" dur="7.19">know a couple more things will know that</text>
  <text start="359.37" dur="5.25">the Inspector General looked into these</text>
  <text start="361.849" dur="5.5">incidents if everything is swept under</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="4.469">the carpet and no charges and no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.349" dur="3.57">arrested and there&amp;#39;s no disciplinary</text>
  <text start="369.089" dur="4.2">action then we know that the Inspector</text>
  <text start="370.919" dur="5.61">General is probably not trustworthy and</text>
  <text start="373.289" dur="5.731">then Congress can go after the Inspector</text>
  <text start="376.529" dur="4.92">General or you know whatever happens</text>
  <text start="379.02" dur="7.38">next so a lot of that is gonna have to</text>
  <text start="381.449" dur="9.571">wait until the IG report comes up but</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="5.53">look bad news is coming out every day</text>

  <text start="678.93" dur="6.11">modus operandi it&amp;#39;s not a one-off event</text>

  <text start="685.04" dur="5.98">this report is sort of confirms that</text>

  <text start="728.73" dur="5.82">last point yeah sorry about that so</text>
  <text start="731.76" dur="5.88">number three the FBI routinely pays</text>
  <text start="734.55" dur="6.45">third party private Intel firms to</text>
  <text start="737.64" dur="6.51">gather evidence used to secure federal</text>
  <text start="741" dur="7.47">search warrants arrest warrants and FISA</text>
  <text start="744.15" dur="6.15">Court warrants okay now yesterday I told</text>
  <text start="748.47" dur="5.13">you that I was listening to some George</text>
  <text start="750.3" dur="7.53">Webb videos and he suspected that the</text>
  <text start="753.6" dur="6.39">FBI actually this creation of the Selah</text>
  <text start="757.83" dur="5.31">dossier with a bunch of true information</text>
  <text start="759.99" dur="5.79">and fake information he says is not a</text>
  <text start="763.14" dur="5.28">one-off thing it is their modus operandi</text>
  <text start="765.78" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s how they operate it&amp;#39;s their normal</text>
  <text start="768.42" dur="7.17">way of doing things and this these this</text>
  <text start="772.89" dur="5.16">information confirms that&amp;#39;s exactly what</text>
  <text start="775.59" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re doing that they have private</text>
  <text start="778.05" dur="4.23">companies a contract with who compiled</text>
  <text start="780.45" dur="3.24">all this information whenever they need</text>
  <text start="782.28" dur="3.179">a warrant they go get the information</text>
  <text start="783.69" dur="3.03">they take it to the judge they get</text>
  <text start="785.459" dur="2.79">the more or they get the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="786.72" dur="8.309">warrant and they go do what they have to</text>
  <text start="788.249" dur="11.94">do so this is all right I&amp;#39;m gonna read</text>
  <text start="795.029" dur="7.23">number four okay FBI does not vet</text>
  <text start="800.189" dur="4.56">privately commissioned investigators</text>
  <text start="802.259" dur="3.81">like fusion GPS who work off the books</text>
  <text start="804.749" dur="3.9">for the bureau</text>
  <text start="806.069" dur="4.401">they don&amp;#39;t vet them they just if you can</text>
  <text start="808.649" dur="4.98">give them information they&amp;#39;ll take it</text>
  <text start="810.47" dur="4.899">the FBI pays these contractors from a</text>
  <text start="813.629" dur="4.38">budget that is not part of its public</text>
  <text start="815.369" dur="5.76">expenditures so it&amp;#39;s not on the public</text>
  <text start="818.009" dur="4.88">record transactions are confidential</text>
  <text start="821.129" dur="5.221">therefore Freedom of Information</text>
  <text start="822.889" dur="6.401">requests on such transactions are easily</text>
  <text start="826.35" dur="5.549">and legally denied so if you want</text>
  <text start="829.29" dur="4.769">information through FOIA and what the</text>
  <text start="831.899" dur="3.69">FBI is doing you&amp;#39;re not gonna get it</text>
  <text start="834.059" dur="5.03">because they don&amp;#39;t have to give it to</text>
  <text start="835.589" dur="7.821">you it&amp;#39;s not a matter of public record</text>
  <text start="839.089" dur="6.79">the last bullet point is that the steel</text>
  <text start="843.41" dur="4.539">Christopher steel and the firm fusion</text>
  <text start="845.879" dur="4.32">GPS may have performed additional</text>
  <text start="847.949" dur="4.26">privately commissioned intelligence work</text>
  <text start="850.199" dur="5.58">for the FBI so that wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise</text>
  <text start="852.209" dur="5.73">anyone the steel dossier and Trump has</text>
  <text start="855.779" dur="6.331">since been proven to be chock full of</text>
  <text start="857.939" dur="7.31">wild and unproven accusations the more</text>
  <text start="862.11" dur="5.969">disturbing revelations however is that</text>
  <text start="865.249" dur="5.56">Republican US senator from the same</text>
  <text start="868.079" dur="5.49">party is trump likely assisted the FBI</text>
  <text start="870.809" dur="4.47">to perform a bogus investigation of a</text>
  <text start="873.569" dur="3.48">presidential candidate during the</text>
  <text start="875.279" dur="4.261">election the results of which were</text>
  <text start="877.049" dur="4.861">leaked to the news media in an attempt</text>
  <text start="879.54" dur="5.25">to boost Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s chances of</text>
  <text start="881.91" dur="5.7">winning the presidency also it now</text>
  <text start="884.79" dur="5.099">appears that the FBI has a definitive</text>
  <text start="887.61" dur="4.439">role in digging up dirt on presidential</text>
  <text start="889.889" dur="5.521">candidates with the likely intent of</text>
  <text start="892.049" dur="5.46">swaying elections it&amp;#39;s a little wonder</text>
  <text start="895.41" dur="3.989">that the FBI has blocked efforts to turn</text>
  <text start="897.509" dur="5.07">over records on its relationship with</text>
  <text start="899.399" dur="4.61">steel fusion GPS and McCain&amp;#39;s role in</text>
  <text start="902.579" dur="4.23">putting the two entities together and</text>
  <text start="904.009" dur="5.01">this is what has come to me in the last</text>
  <text start="906.809" dur="7.731">couple of days</text>
  <text start="909.019" dur="7.811">Devin Nunez who is head of the the House</text>
  <text start="914.54" dur="6.28">Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="916.83" dur="7.23">he went inside that skit he was taken</text>
  <text start="920.82" dur="6.81">inside there by Ezra Cohen watt Nick and</text>
  <text start="924.06" dur="5.07">he saw the people that were their names</text>
  <text start="927.63" dur="3.47">are being unmasked he saw the</text>
  <text start="929.13" dur="4.83">intelligence he saw the raw data and</text>
  <text start="931.1" dur="4.81">when Devin Nunez came out of that skiff</text>
  <text start="933.96" dur="6.9">he looked like he had just swallowed a</text>
  <text start="935.91" dur="7.82">cat and he had a press conference that</text>
  <text start="940.86" dur="5.67">he held where he was obviously very</text>
  <text start="943.73" dur="6.79">disturbed and uncomfortable about what</text>
  <text start="946.53" dur="7.83">he saw he was like I can&amp;#39;t believe I</text>
  <text start="950.52" dur="6.8">just saw what I actually saw and so he</text>
  <text start="954.36" dur="6.3">has been pushing and pushing and pushing</text>
  <text start="957.32" dur="5.53">for the FBI in the DOJ to release</text>
  <text start="960.66" dur="5.01">information on the steel dossier and</text>
  <text start="962.85" dur="6.09">fusion GPS and he has been stalled at</text>
  <text start="965.67" dur="4.86">every single way they have refused to</text>
  <text start="968.94" dur="3.87">give the information refused to give the</text>
  <text start="970.53" dur="4.56">bank account information wouldn&amp;#39;t give</text>
  <text start="972.81" dur="4.14">any information to them at the risk of</text>
  <text start="975.09" dur="5.7">being held in contempt of Congress and</text>
  <text start="976.95" dur="7.02">like I said yesterday if the DOJ and the</text>
  <text start="980.79" dur="7.32">FBI do not want that information given</text>
  <text start="983.97" dur="6.36">to Congress there is something very very</text>
  <text start="988.11" dur="5.85">crooked going on and they don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="990.33" dur="6.51">that exposed so today Sarah Carter</text>
  <text start="993.96" dur="4.89">reported that Nunez is going to he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="996.84" dur="4.77">subpoena and he&amp;#39;s going to get this</text>
  <text start="998.85" dur="5.25">information because look Nunez has been</text>
  <text start="1001.61" dur="4.77">in the tie that gift and he knows what</text>
  <text start="1004.1" dur="5.7">is going on he knows what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1006.38" dur="3.96">and it&amp;#39;s not like Nunez doesn&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="1009.8" dur="3.78">facts</text>
  <text start="1010.34" dur="6.81">he knows effects he wants to get the FBI</text>
  <text start="1013.58" dur="6.6">to publicly disclose what is what he</text>
  <text start="1017.15" dur="5.19">knows is going on that is what that is</text>
  <text start="1020.18" dur="3.72">what word eminence knows what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1022.34" dur="4.53">Adam Schiff knows what&amp;#39;s going on to</text>
  <text start="1023.9" dur="4.86">ship went inside the skiff to ship</text>
  <text start="1026.87" dur="3.54">although his eyes are normally a little</text>
  <text start="1028.76" dur="3.42">bigger than normal his eyes were like</text>
  <text start="1030.41" dur="5.52">saucers when he came out of that skiff</text>
  <text start="1032.18" dur="6.39">so Nunez and shift Botha know what is</text>
  <text start="1035.93" dur="4.89">going on with the DOJ and the FBI the</text>
  <text start="1038.57" dur="7.32">FISA Court warrants and the 702 they</text>
  <text start="1040.82" dur="9.18">know and and Nunez is trying to get that</text>
  <text start="1045.89" dur="4.65">information out and he and when it when</text>
  <text start="1050" dur="3.99">it comes</text>
  <text start="1050.54" dur="5.67">the FBI is going to it is not gonna go</text>

  <text start="1063.95" dur="3.57">essentially just had a speech nice</text>
  <text start="1065.75" dur="3.18">speech and everything but the people who</text>
  <text start="1067.52" dur="4.2">are asking legitimate questions</text>
  <text start="1068.93" dur="6.42">Ratcliffe and Andy Biggs I saw for sure</text>
  <text start="1071.72" dur="7.05">they know something is up with the FISA</text>
  <text start="1075.35" dur="5.7">Court and the warrants and the dossiers</text>

  <text start="1093.35" dur="5.16">kind of know what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1095.56" dur="4.38">unfortunately these hearings are not a</text>
  <text start="1098.51" dur="3.96">good way to get at that information</text>
  <text start="1099.94" dur="4.84">Chris rate is not going to publicly</text>
  <text start="1102.47" dur="5.75">disclose any of that information they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1104.78" dur="6.48">just telling us they&amp;#39;re signaling to us</text>

  <text start="1129.08" dur="3.12">and a congressional hearing these</text>

  <text start="1133.58" dur="5.94">anything other than they can defund and</text>
  <text start="1135.95" dur="4.77">they can write or get rid of legislation</text>
