  <text start="84.95" dur="4.519">interested in the healing frequencies I</text>
  <text start="86.929" dur="5.73">started talking to me about 4:32</text>
  <text start="89.469" dur="7">frequencies ha years ago when I was</text>
  <text start="92.659" dur="6.06">writing the book on healing and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="96.469" dur="4.65">know anything about this stuff I was</text>
  <text start="98.719" dur="5.28">like oh gosh it sounded so far out there</text>
  <text start="101.119" dur="4.86">but you know I&amp;#39;ve been getting to know</text>
  <text start="103.999" dur="4.591">people a little more who have had some</text>
  <text start="105.979" dur="5.85">interesting experiences with different</text>

  <text start="129.47" dur="4.2">because he he&amp;#39;s quite the fellow and</text>
  <text start="131.569" dur="4.651">he&amp;#39;s got some he&amp;#39;s got some really</text>
  <text start="133.67" dur="5.85">interesting revelation on music in</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="5.58">general yeah I really enjoyed it I when</text>
  <text start="139.52" dur="3.48">I listened to his the podcast you did</text>
  <text start="141.8" dur="4.65">with him I&amp;#39;m sitting there thinking okay</text>
  <text start="143" dur="4.95">this makes sense because was weird cuz I</text>
  <text start="146.45" dur="3.99">was you know worshiping the other day</text>
  <text start="147.95" dur="3.03">and I had a drum and one of the Native</text>
  <text start="150.44" dur="3.48">American</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="5.1">drumset I just made and I felt led to</text>
  <text start="153.92" dur="3.929">just sit there and beat the thing and I</text>
  <text start="156.08" dur="3.81">could feel the vibrations completely</text>
  <text start="157.849" dur="4.741">going into my body and I did it on my</text>
  <text start="159.89" dur="4.769">head I did it especially in my gut area</text>
  <text start="162.59" dur="3.959">and I&amp;#39;m like I know it&amp;#39;s doing something</text>
  <text start="164.659" dur="3.36">but I don&amp;#39;t necessarily know but you</text>
  <text start="166.549" dur="3.69">could feel the vibrations just soaking</text>
  <text start="168.019" dur="3.901">through that&amp;#39;s cool I mean I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="170.239" dur="4.381">understand that stuff but I know that</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="5.25">something is happening right when people</text>
  <text start="174.62" dur="5.339">play music as I think they&amp;#39;re led by the</text>
  <text start="177.17" dur="4.26">Holy Spirit you don&amp;#39;t understand why it</text>
  <text start="179.959" dur="3.541">doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="181.43" dur="6.41">spiritual and spiritual stuff doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="4.34">really always resonate with our mind</text>
  <text start="188.92" dur="5.61">this whole thing for me that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.5" dur="5.04">been like all the way from the beginning</text>
  <text start="194.53" dur="6.16">and I was sharing with someone yesterday</text>
  <text start="197.54" dur="7.949">I have a classical musician I like the</text>
  <text start="200.69" dur="7.919">little black dot right I&amp;#39;m happy and</text>
  <text start="205.489" dur="5.701">then to do something like this you have</text>
  <text start="208.609" dur="4.861">to completely let all that go and just</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="4.65">sit there and play and I was talking to</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="5.01">someone earlier today and the free</text>
  <text start="215.84" dur="5.25">download called beloved friend that is</text>
  <text start="218.48" dur="5.31">on my website when I was doing that in</text>
  <text start="221.09" dur="5.429">the studio I&amp;#39;m sitting there playing and</text>
  <text start="223.79" dur="4.949">next thing I know I&amp;#39;m there&amp;#39;s him what</text>
  <text start="226.519" dur="4.741">what him am i playing I didn&amp;#39;t realize I</text>
  <text start="228.739" dur="4.291">was doing it so you were doing something</text>
  <text start="231.26" dur="4.74">that you weren&amp;#39;t consciously aware of</text>
  <text start="233.03" dur="5.19">what it was right and then when I when I</text>
  <text start="236" dur="5.099">got done the recording engineer goes</text>
  <text start="238.22" dur="5.22">that to him he goes it&amp;#39;s Sebelius&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="241.099" dur="4.831">Finlandia I&amp;#39;m like oh that&amp;#39;s what it was</text>
  <text start="243.44" dur="4.35">and I had decided before we did the</text>
  <text start="245.93" dur="3.929">recording that I was going to call it</text>
  <text start="247.79" dur="4.77">beloved friend because the word Dave</text>
  <text start="249.859" dur="4.801">means beloved friend and after the</text>
  <text start="252.56" dur="4.169">recording he looked it up the words the</text>
  <text start="254.66" dur="8.4">first verse talks about Jesus being our</text>
  <text start="256.729" dur="8.611">beloved friend now alright I have to get</text>
  <text start="263.06" dur="5.49">the backstory you are trained as a</text>
  <text start="265.34" dur="5.1">classical musician yes and how long have</text>
  <text start="268.55" dur="4.56">you been doing playing classical music</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="5.13">40 years I started out in the band</text>
  <text start="273.11" dur="5.03">program and where I live in Moscow Idaho</text>
  <text start="275.57" dur="4.98">and when all the way got into college</text>
  <text start="278.14" dur="6.27">did my bachelor&amp;#39;s here at University of</text>
  <text start="280.55" dur="6.05">Idaho and I was going to be a</text>
  <text start="284.41" dur="4.32">in Symphony Orchestra&amp;#39;s what I thought I</text>
  <text start="286.6" dur="4.35">wanted to do so I then went to Yale</text>
  <text start="288.73" dur="4.2">because I was really wanting to be</text>
  <text start="290.95" dur="3.6">top-notch and then after that I said</text>
  <text start="292.93" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s what I want</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="4.38">did the band director thing for a while</text>
  <text start="296.29" dur="5.52">and finally finished my doctorate wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="298.93" dur="4.95">until 2004 and so I just mostly been</text>
  <text start="301.81" dur="4.47">teaching in college and stuff but then I</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="4.38">have always played in praise teams in</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="4.47">churches my main instruments clarinet</text>
  <text start="308.26" dur="4.86">but I do play the piano I started out</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="3.48">mostly accompanying all of my students</text>
  <text start="313.12" dur="3.03">so they&amp;#39;d have someone who could play</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="4.32">their piano parts so that in a nutshell</text>
  <text start="316.15" dur="5.01">I noticed you play a quite a bit of</text>
  <text start="318.55" dur="5.1">synthesizer well you have to in order to</text>
  <text start="321.16" dur="4.89">tune it to 432 because you can&amp;#39;t do in a</text>
  <text start="323.65" dur="4.83">regular piano down that far right so it</text>
  <text start="326.05" dur="4.95">has to be electronically tuned right so</text>
  <text start="328.48" dur="5.61">I use different sounds depending on what</text>
  <text start="331" dur="4.77">I feel at the moment how did you get</text>
  <text start="334.09" dur="5.52">interested and how did this whole</text>
  <text start="335.77" dur="5.459">evolved about tuning down to 432 and can</text>
  <text start="339.61" dur="3.69">you explain a little bit about what</text>
  <text start="341.229" dur="4.951">happened what God was showing you as a</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="4.86">music history professor teach music</text>
  <text start="346.18" dur="5.34">history classes I do a lot of research</text>
  <text start="348.16" dur="5.43">on tunings and ran across some videos by</text>
  <text start="351.52" dur="4.08">this guy named Howard Goodall who goes</text>
  <text start="353.59" dur="4.74">into the history of tuning in the</text>
  <text start="355.6" dur="4.8">history of equal temperament and how our</text>
  <text start="358.33" dur="4.11">modern scale came about and I&amp;#39;m sitting</text>
  <text start="360.4" dur="3.81">there thinking and then the soulful</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="3.69">frequencies came up and I&amp;#39;m like okay</text>
  <text start="364.21" dur="4.5">what are these and so I go look at them</text>
  <text start="366.13" dur="5.039">and it was trying to pay attention and</text>
  <text start="368.71" dur="5.25">then I realized that the 432 concert</text>
  <text start="371.169" dur="4.951">pitch fits more with in the the tuning</text>
  <text start="373.96" dur="3.9">of the earth because the Schumann</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="4.29">resonances are seven point eight three</text>
  <text start="377.86" dur="4.05">and that&amp;#39;s the fundamental so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="380.41" dur="2.64">talking about pitch there&amp;#39;s one main</text>
  <text start="381.91" dur="3.3">pitch and then you have all these</text>
  <text start="383.05" dur="4.71">sympathetic pitches that come afterwards</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="4.44">that you can feel but not necessarily</text>
  <text start="387.76" dur="3.27">hear right those are all part of the</text>
  <text start="389.65" dur="3.21">different what they call the harmonic</text>
  <text start="391.03" dur="3.99">series so I just started doing some</text>
  <text start="392.86" dur="4.35">research on that and I think that the</text>
  <text start="395.02" dur="4.2">clincher was last spring sitting in my</text>
  <text start="397.21" dur="4.05">office and I&amp;#39;d watched some videos</text>
  <text start="399.22" dur="4.83">online about someone saying that people</text>
  <text start="401.26" dur="5.34">sing naturally in the 432 concert pitch</text>
  <text start="404.05" dur="4.38">and like okay yeah right so I go on</text>
  <text start="406.6" dur="4.98">YouTube and I find all these videos of</text>
  <text start="408.43" dur="6.32">these people singing I tried to find not</text>
  <text start="411.58" dur="5.579">Western musicians like African tribes</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="4.779">Aboriginal stuff Aboriginal</text>
  <text start="417.159" dur="3.54">and then I would hold up my tuner and I</text>
  <text start="419.529" dur="3.87">have a kind of tuner that will tell you</text>
  <text start="420.699" dur="5.101">the frequency and so whenever they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="423.399" dur="4.56">reached the home note the main note if</text>
  <text start="425.8" dur="3.959">it wouldn&amp;#39;t register it I&amp;#39;d hum the note</text>
  <text start="427.959" dur="3.33">they were singing into the tuner and</text>
  <text start="429.759" dur="4.98">then I write all the pitches down I did</text>
  <text start="431.289" dur="6.27">30 of those videos and 27 out of the 30</text>
  <text start="434.739" dur="5.76">were in like nailing the 432 concert</text>
  <text start="437.559" dur="5.43">pitch and the three that weren&amp;#39;t were it</text>
  <text start="440.499" dur="5.1">for around 4:30 I think they were even</text>
  <text start="442.989" dur="5.22">lower they were slightly lower I mean</text>
  <text start="445.599" dur="5.52">traditionally concert pitch before we</text>
  <text start="448.209" dur="5.97">started having instruments that measured</text>
  <text start="451.119" dur="6.29">specifics it hovered around 432 anyway</text>
  <text start="454.179" dur="6.78">do you think that the innate ingrained</text>
  <text start="457.409" dur="6.31">natural frequency is 432 when we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="460.959" dur="5.25">trained to play music at a different</text>
  <text start="463.719" dur="4.771">frequency well I think it&amp;#39;s even the</text>
  <text start="466.209" dur="3.69">train because I found some videos of</text>
  <text start="468.49" dur="4.379">train singers that do the same thing</text>
  <text start="469.899" dur="5.37">when you just sit and sing naturally the</text>
  <text start="472.869" dur="3.57">tendency is always seeing low I mean I</text>
  <text start="475.269" dur="3.99">don&amp;#39;t know if you did you ever sing in</text>
  <text start="476.439" dur="5.16">choir in school at all I didn&amp;#39;t but my</text>
  <text start="479.259" dur="4.41">wife had a short career as a singer</text>
  <text start="481.599" dur="4.65">she&amp;#39;s sang in a couple of bands and she</text>
  <text start="483.669" dur="4.8">has a very low voice for a woman she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.249" dur="4.92">actually a tenor yeah me too I always</text>
  <text start="488.469" dur="5.04">say I think as long as it&amp;#39;s below middle</text>
  <text start="491.169" dur="4.8">C level so I say all I think below sea</text>
  <text start="493.509" dur="5.01">level everybody was singing with Michael</text>
  <text start="495.969" dur="4.44">Buble and Frank Sinatra and the couny</text>
  <text start="498.519" dur="4.14">because they all sing in that in that</text>
  <text start="500.409" dur="4.68">range choirs when they&amp;#39;re singing</text>
  <text start="502.659" dur="4.8">acapella well a lot of times walk up and</text>
  <text start="505.089" dur="3.36">play a note on the piano and then choir</text>
  <text start="507.459" dur="2.79">director will come up when they&amp;#39;re done</text>
  <text start="508.449" dur="3.87">singing and play the note oh man you</text>
  <text start="510.249" dur="5.22">guys went flat and of course everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.319" dur="3.69">like oh but in reality their voice just</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="2.97">tense</text>
  <text start="516.009" dur="3.93">I call it entrainment I&amp;#39;ve been doing a</text>
  <text start="518.439" dur="3.66">bunch of research on the Trainmen and so</text>
  <text start="519.939" dur="5.281">it&amp;#39;s like when you have two o&amp;#39;clock and</text>
  <text start="522.099" dur="5.821">they start out of sync eventually they</text>
  <text start="525.22" dur="5.01">will sync together and they call that</text>
  <text start="527.92" dur="4.56">entrainment so that whatever the weaker</text>
  <text start="530.23" dur="4.32">frequency will in train to the stronger</text>
  <text start="532.48" dur="4.65">frequency which is I think what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.55" dur="5.55">happening when we sing because if the</text>
  <text start="537.13" dur="4.8">432 concert pitch spectrum that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="540.1" dur="4.799">the notes that fit within that tuning</text>
  <text start="541.93" dur="4.56">are closer to the Schumann resonances</text>
  <text start="544.899" dur="4.021">and other frequencies in the earth</text>
  <text start="546.49" dur="4.14">that&amp;#39;s a stronger frequent they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="548.92" dur="2.04">to they&amp;#39;re going to tune to it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="2.34">going to</text>
  <text start="550.96" dur="5.04">so I think that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening with</text>
  <text start="552.97" dur="5.25">our voices so so interesting and that</text>
  <text start="556" dur="4.32">would explain a lot of things like why</text>
  <text start="558.22" dur="5.34">you said like why people sometimes sing</text>
  <text start="560.32" dur="5.7">off-key maybe they&amp;#39;re not really singing</text>
  <text start="563.56" dur="5.01">off-key they&amp;#39;re singing out of the key</text>
  <text start="566.02" dur="4.92">that the director wants to be singing</text>
  <text start="568.57" dur="5.519">but they&amp;#39;re singing in the natural</text>
  <text start="570.94" dur="5.61">frequency maybe interesting stuff when I</text>
  <text start="574.089" dur="4.291">sing naturally with that going up to the</text>
  <text start="576.55" dur="3.72">piano and getting a starting pitch and I</text>
  <text start="578.38" dur="4.23">just start singing as long as there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="580.27" dur="5.28">music in the background then I tend to</text>
  <text start="582.61" dur="5.7">be closer to 432 interesting I know that</text>
  <text start="585.55" dur="4.71">my appliance is matched for 32 tunings</text>
  <text start="588.31" dur="4.17">because I think that they two are going</text>
  <text start="590.26" dur="4.079">to entrain to the frequencies in the</text>
  <text start="592.48" dur="4.919">earth I wrote down my espresso machine</text>

  <text start="868.9" dur="4.53">gonna know that until I come out of the</text>
  <text start="870.37" dur="4.2">studio I go in and I just say okay God</text>
  <text start="873.43" dur="3.27">what do you want to do with this music</text>
  <text start="874.57" dur="4.53">today and what&amp;#39;s really cool is the</text>
  <text start="876.7" dur="4.37">engineer is a Christian and the</text>

  <text start="883.33" dur="3.99">and so I just get the elevator and go up</text>
  <text start="885.43" dur="4.35">to the fourth floor all my keyboard up</text>
  <text start="887.32" dur="4.95">however all my percussion instruments</text>
  <text start="889.78" dur="4.5">that lay it all out and we always pray</text>
  <text start="892.27" dur="4.23">into the music when we&amp;#39;re recording it</text>
  <text start="894.28" dur="4.71">then once you&amp;#39;ve mixed everything then</text>
  <text start="896.5" dur="5.1">you have to do with the final record to</text>
  <text start="898.99" dur="4.98">put the two together and so it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="901.6" dur="5.91">not until after I get done that I really</text>
  <text start="903.97" dur="6.45">know what its gonna do and again for me</text>
  <text start="907.51" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s really strange because the</text>
  <text start="910.42" dur="3.42">classical musicians we go into a</text>
  <text start="911.89" dur="3.9">practice room and we spent hours and</text>
  <text start="913.84" dur="4.44">hours and hours and hours practicing a</text>
  <text start="915.79" dur="6.81">piece of music to perform on a recital</text>
  <text start="918.28" dur="6.57">here I go in and I just sit down and I</text>
  <text start="922.6" dur="4.71">just let the Holy Spirit speak through</text>
  <text start="924.85" dur="3.87">me and someone said to me today well</text>
  <text start="927.31" dur="2.64">what do you do if you make mistakes can</text>
  <text start="928.72" dur="3.27">you go back and change him I&amp;#39;m like I</text>
  <text start="929.95" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t change anything because everything</text>
  <text start="931.99" dur="4.26">I play it I believe was intended by the</text>
  <text start="934.15" dur="4.29">Holy Spirit and there&amp;#39;s a couple places</text>
  <text start="936.25" dur="3.72">where there are some mistakes but I turn</text>
  <text start="938.44" dur="5.82">the mistakes into something happy</text>
  <text start="939.97" dur="7.11">accidents yeah so you go into the</text>
  <text start="944.26" dur="4.68">recording studio so Wazzu and then do</text>
  <text start="947.08" dur="3.99">you lay down percussion track first or</text>
  <text start="948.94" dur="2.519">do you lay down do the synthesizer first</text>
  <text start="951.07" dur="1.98">or do</text>
  <text start="951.459" dur="4.021">just whatever comes to you you start</text>
  <text start="953.05" dur="5.039">doing it well I used to lay down the</text>
  <text start="955.48" dur="4.529">keyboard part but I with my new keyboard</text>
  <text start="958.089" dur="4.081">which I&amp;#39;ve only had since July I can</text>
  <text start="960.009" dur="4.291">actually put it into the keyboard before</text>
  <text start="962.17" dur="3.209">going to the studio which is a lot</text>
  <text start="964.3" dur="3.149">easier it was always a little bit</text>
  <text start="965.379" dur="4.95">nerve-wracking doing that part in the</text>
  <text start="967.449" dur="6.75">studio and so what I&amp;#39;ve been doing is</text>
  <text start="970.329" dur="5.55">inviting people to at my house and then</text>
  <text start="974.199" dur="3.42">I we actually have a live worship</text>
  <text start="975.879" dur="4.95">session which I record into the keyboard</text>
  <text start="977.619" dur="4.981">and then turn that into the actual so</text>
  <text start="980.829" dur="3.51">you record that digitally and then give</text>
  <text start="982.6" dur="3.239">that to your friend who&amp;#39;s the engineer</text>
  <text start="984.339" dur="4.831">and he mixes that into the final</text>
  <text start="985.839" dur="6">recording well what he does is this week</text>
  <text start="989.17" dur="4.8">gonna win he plays that and then while</text>
  <text start="991.839" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s playing I do the same thing with</text>
  <text start="993.97" dur="1.679">the percussion that I did with the</text>
  <text start="995.259" dur="2.82">keyboard</text>
  <text start="995.649" dur="4.8">you never know what I&amp;#39;m gonna do until I</text>
  <text start="998.079" dur="4.891">hear it at the moment you know I</text>
  <text start="1000.449" dur="4.591">understand that process better than you</text>
  <text start="1002.97" dur="4.83">would think because I do the same thing</text>
  <text start="1005.04" dur="5.159">when I&amp;#39;m writing books ah I literally</text>
  <text start="1007.8" dur="5.339">when I sit down to write I sit down at</text>

  <text start="1014.699" dur="5.7">I never really know people ask me why</text>
  <text start="1017.549" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;m so a DD when it comes to books</text>
  <text start="1020.399" dur="3.66">because I&amp;#39;m literally working on six or</text>
  <text start="1022.199" dur="4.681">seven or eight different books at any</text>
  <text start="1024.059" dur="4.801">given time it&amp;#39;s because on any day that</text>
  <text start="1026.88" dur="4.829">I wake up I never know what the Holy</text>
  <text start="1028.86" dur="4.679">Spirit wants to teach me so I sit down</text>
  <text start="1031.709" dur="4.08">on a day when I want to write and I say</text>
  <text start="1033.539" dur="3.63">okay what are we gonna write about is it</text>

  <text start="1058.02" dur="5.009">know from time to time what its gonna be</text>
  <text start="1059.669" dur="5.101">for me it&amp;#39;s really cool to let the Holy</text>
  <text start="1063.029" dur="4.231">Spirit speak and then just record</text>
  <text start="1064.77" dur="3.6">whatever he gives you and like you said</text>

  <text start="1162.21" dur="6.06">creatively whether you&amp;#39;re a painter or a</text>

  <text start="1232.5" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;d say well I&amp;#39;m gonna play this and</text>
  <text start="1235.05" dur="3.03">play this but they couldn&amp;#39;t tell me what</text>

  <text start="1247.89" dur="3.93">if you play a C I know you&amp;#39;re playing a</text>
  <text start="1249.39" dur="4.71">C so I just write all the notes and then</text>
  <text start="1251.82" dur="3.75">I go home and say okay how does this</text>
  <text start="1254.1" dur="4.32">make sense and I was trying to do it</text>
  <text start="1255.57" dur="5.01">with my mind and I just said okay God</text>
  <text start="1258.42" dur="4.23">how am i because I&amp;#39;ve asked people how</text>
  <text start="1260.58" dur="5.94">do you learn to play in the spirit and I</text>
  <text start="1262.65" dur="7.26">think a lot of it started once I put</text>
  <text start="1266.52" dur="6.54">myself in a position to just sit be</text>
  <text start="1269.91" dur="5.58">quiet and learn to hear from God and</text>
  <text start="1273.06" dur="4.5">listen to his voice because I always</text>
  <text start="1275.49" dur="4.59">said I know God speaking to me I just</text>

  <text start="1286.08" dur="5.01">three four hours a day sometimes and</text>
  <text start="1288.12" dur="5.76">that puts me in a place to be able to</text>
  <text start="1291.09" dur="5.43">hear where your spirit can receive</text>
  <text start="1293.88" dur="4.47">revelation much more easily you know</text>

  <text start="1414.169" dur="5.611">when patricia goes and does conferences</text>
  <text start="1416.38" dur="5.32">caleb would do the flag worship and he</text>
  <text start="1419.78" dur="4.74">taught a flight worship workshop that i</text>
  <text start="1421.7" dur="7.01">happened to go to one time years ago it</text>
  <text start="1424.52" dur="7.26">was amazing and he explained how he</text>
  <text start="1428.71" dur="4.87">chooses the colors of the flags when</text>
  <text start="1431.78" dur="3.99">he&amp;#39;s doing worship i never really</text>
  <text start="1433.58" dur="5.4">thought about this but he said what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1435.77" dur="6.42">doing is during worship my eyes are</text>
  <text start="1438.98" dur="6.54">focused on heaven and I see colors in</text>
  <text start="1442.19" dur="5.55">the heavens I will see purple I will see</text>
  <text start="1445.52" dur="6.42">gold I will see red I&amp;#39;ll see different</text>
  <text start="1447.74" dur="6.179">colors and the colors signify to me what</text>
  <text start="1451.94" dur="4.92">heaven is doing at that time</text>
  <text start="1453.919" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s a revelatory color and it</text>
  <text start="1456.86" dur="5.22">symbolizes something of whether it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1459.679" dur="4.471">frequency or whatever he says I will</text>
  <text start="1462.08" dur="5.01">change flags the colors of flags</text>
  <text start="1464.15" dur="6.029">depending on what I&amp;#39;m seeing in heaven</text>
  <text start="1467.09" dur="5.1">and while I was doing this participate</text>
  <text start="1470.179" dur="5.161">in this workshop he gave he would did</text>
  <text start="1472.19" dur="6.45">some exercises and that is exactly what</text>
  <text start="1475.34" dur="4.829">I saw as I focused my mind on heaven I</text>
  <text start="1478.64" dur="3.75">saw all these colors changing and I</text>
  <text start="1480.169" dur="5.821">would see sometimes I would see like the</text>
  <text start="1482.39" dur="6.3">lion walking across this stage like</text>
  <text start="1485.99" dur="4.56">had a red velvet background where I</text>
  <text start="1488.69" dur="5.13">would see a lot of gold or I would see</text>
  <text start="1490.55" dur="5.31">deep blues and purples and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1493.82" dur="4.41">amazing when you start to tune into the</text>
  <text start="1495.86" dur="6">spiritual world what God will show you</text>
  <text start="1498.23" dur="5.16">and how you can convey that to other</text>
  <text start="1501.86" dur="3.54">people because that&amp;#39;s as flagging is</text>
  <text start="1503.39" dur="3.51">really about it&amp;#39;s kind of conveying what</text>
  <text start="1505.4" dur="4.17">is heaven saying what is heaven doing</text>
  <text start="1506.9" dur="4.17">getting in tune with heaven yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1509.57" dur="3.54">the same thing I do the same thing</text>
  <text start="1511.07" dur="4.53">because sometimes what I&amp;#39;ll do is I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1513.11" dur="3.92">record something into the keyboard then</text>
  <text start="1515.6" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;ll turn around and play it back</text>
  <text start="1517.03" dur="4">because you know they can loop it and</text>
  <text start="1519.23" dur="3.6">then it&amp;#39;ll come out and I&amp;#39;ll join them</text>
  <text start="1521.03" dur="4.2">on percussion and that&amp;#39;s usually when I</text>
  <text start="1522.83" dur="3.63">get off the flags and and do things with</text>
  <text start="1525.23" dur="2.88">the flags or get out of percussion</text>
  <text start="1526.46" dur="3.45">instrument sometimes I&amp;#39;ll put something</text>
  <text start="1528.11" dur="4.53">on my legs and stomp around and make a</text>
  <text start="1529.91" dur="4.86">sound and and I&amp;#39;m doing the same thing</text>
  <text start="1532.64" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;m okay I really feel I&amp;#39;m supposed to</text>
  <text start="1534.77" dur="6.96">be waving the purple flags right now and</text>
  <text start="1536.66" dur="6.87">I&amp;#39;ve named it my flags you know I made</text>

  <text start="1669.17" dur="4.32">I don&amp;#39;t visions I don&amp;#39;t seem to have the</text>
  <text start="1672.05" dur="5.1">kind of revelation that other people get</text>
  <text start="1673.49" dur="7.26">and my position more and more is</text>
  <text start="1677.15" dur="6.12">becoming if you will practice if you</text>
  <text start="1680.75" dur="4.92">will set time aside to give yourself</text>
  <text start="1683.27" dur="5.43">time to see visions to hear God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="1685.67" dur="4.71">to have those experiences the more you</text>
  <text start="1688.7" dur="3.84">practice the better you&amp;#39;ll get at it</text>
  <text start="1690.38" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s just like anything else and I I</text>
  <text start="1692.54" dur="4.68">think that that&amp;#39;s really clicking in for</text>
  <text start="1695.39" dur="4.04">me because I understand practice you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1697.22" dur="4.68">a musician you have to understand right</text>

  <text start="1728.09" dur="3.57">you pick up that piece of music ten</text>
  <text start="1729.59" dur="3.9">years later your hands are still gonna</text>
  <text start="1731.66" dur="3.48">remember how to do it and it&amp;#39;s not gonna</text>
  <text start="1733.49" dur="3.84">take us long to learn it the second time</text>

  <text start="1957.17" dur="3.57">there&amp;#39;s plenty of time to do things and</text>

  <text start="1960.74" dur="4.53">this then I told Finnick about it we</text>
  <text start="1963.23" dur="4.92">talked about it she goes well go back go</text>
  <text start="1965.27" dur="3.24">ask more questions hang on hang on hang</text>
  <text start="1968.15" dur="4.31">on</text>
  <text start="1968.51" dur="3.95">you did this while you were driving yeah</text>
  <text start="1973.24" dur="6.4">you&amp;#39;re tooling down whatever highway it</text>
  <text start="1976.31" dur="5.88">is you&amp;#39;re like in your mind yeah you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1984.17" dur="6.06">awesome Seneca says go back go back so</text>
  <text start="1988.91" dur="4.65">the next night I went back and that was</text>
  <text start="1990.23" dur="4.5">when I saw the woman sitting in the room</text>
  <text start="1993.56" dur="3.84">with nothing around her and I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="1994.73" dur="4.53">okay am I in the right place and then</text>
  <text start="1997.4" dur="3.15">the next morning got the revelation well</text>
  <text start="1999.26" dur="3.09">if we&amp;#39;re trying to do things on our own</text>
  <text start="2000.55" dur="4.53">strength we have zero resources to help</text>
  <text start="2002.35" dur="7.71">us it&amp;#39;s basically like ah I&amp;#39;m clue full</text>
  <text start="2005.08" dur="6.69">now and so I think the next one was on a</text>
  <text start="2010.06" dur="3.45">Sunday and it was a Sunday because I had</text>
  <text start="2011.77" dur="4.41">to go to Whitworth to hear one of my</text>
  <text start="2013.51" dur="5.04">students give a his junior recital so</text>
  <text start="2016.18" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s why they were so close because I</text>
  <text start="2018.55" dur="3.509">had to go up twice that week</text>
  <text start="2020.47" dur="4.26">and that&amp;#39;s what I have the big one where</text>
  <text start="2022.059" dur="5.161">I go up and saw these lines of people</text>
  <text start="2024.73" dur="4.14">and you go get in the lines and as soon</text>
  <text start="2027.22" dur="4.74">as you received it that just became a</text>
  <text start="2028.87" dur="6.15">part of you that was so interesting and</text>
  <text start="2031.96" dur="5.28">that is how heaven is it&amp;#39;s like when you</text>
  <text start="2035.02" dur="4.56">experience something it becomes a part</text>
  <text start="2037.24" dur="3.929">of you yeah it should not like hanging</text>
  <text start="2039.58" dur="3.99">off of you or you&amp;#39;re carrying it around</text>
  <text start="2041.169" dur="4.38">no it&amp;#39;s part of you well just imagine</text>
  <text start="2043.57" dur="4.38">when I&amp;#39;m standing in the line with the</text>
  <text start="2045.549" dur="6.63">dude with the paintbrush painting the</text>
  <text start="2047.95" dur="6.33">colors and it goes in the paintbrush was</text>
  <text start="2052.179" dur="4.621">in me too and it dip in it and there was</text>
  <text start="2054.28" dur="4.23">more painting and and I&amp;#39;m like looking</text>
  <text start="2056.8" dur="3.66">at my and like oh this is way cool man</text>
  <text start="2058.51" dur="5.82">like rock on dudes</text>
  <text start="2060.46" dur="6.3">and so that was interesting and then the</text>
  <text start="2064.33" dur="6.539">one with a musical instrument at a</text>
  <text start="2066.76" dur="5.52">retreat last fall I was laying there and</text>
  <text start="2070.869" dur="3.151">then someone in the room think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2072.28" dur="3.75">an angel putting a musical instrument I</text>
  <text start="2074.02" dur="5.339">can&amp;#39;t even explain what it is into you</text>
  <text start="2076.03" dur="4.649">right now and and so there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="2079.359" dur="3.03">different occasions where musical</text>
  <text start="2080.679" dur="3.93">instruments have been put inside of me</text>
  <text start="2082.389" dur="4.831">and you don&amp;#39;t necessarily understand</text>
  <text start="2084.609" dur="4.861">right away what&amp;#39;s going on so I think</text>
  <text start="2087.22" dur="4.919">that some of the revelation of this will</text>
  <text start="2089.47" dur="5.1">be forthcoming one of the lines I stood</text>
  <text start="2092.139" dur="3.631">in there was I called them being since I</text>
  <text start="2094.57" dur="3.9">wasn&amp;#39;t paying attention to what they</text>
  <text start="2095.77" dur="6.24">were that had this light just emanating</text>
  <text start="2098.47" dur="5.7">all around it you know and I go stand in</text>
  <text start="2102.01" dur="4.05">the line and I just became light so</text>
  <text start="2104.17" dur="5.04">anyone who had passed through this line</text>
  <text start="2106.06" dur="6.299">became light and then I think it was the</text>
  <text start="2109.21" dur="9.3">next morning Kim was still here and she</text>
  <text start="2112.359" dur="8.821">goes you&amp;#39;re glowing that is how the</text>
  <text start="2118.51" dur="7.32">understanding comes later when you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2125.83" dur="3.18">so I just</text>
  <text start="2127.21" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;ve had several but that&amp;#39;s the one</text>
  <text start="2129.01" dur="5.37">that&amp;#39;s most now hang on because this is</text>
  <text start="2132.46" dur="4.29">where we&amp;#39;re gonna inspect the fruit okay</text>

  <text start="2269.09" dur="5.19">systems have kind of perverted them and</text>
  <text start="2270.77" dur="5.16">Satan has kind of distorted them and use</text>
  <text start="2274.28" dur="3.24">them for something else other than what</text>
  <text start="2275.93" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re originally created for right</text>
  <text start="2277.52" dur="5.28">which is interesting and I believe that</text>
  <text start="2280.79" dur="3.45">if the Holy Spirit wants you to create</text>
  <text start="2282.8" dur="3.06">this music and put on this guy&amp;#39;s website</text>

  <text start="2292.88" dur="3.959">it&amp;#39;s like sneaking into the enemy camp</text>
  <text start="2294.619" dur="4.921">and just lobbing a bomb in there that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2407.78" dur="3.839">there&amp;#39;s one of the reasons I&amp;#39;ve kind of</text>
  <text start="2408.92" dur="5.1">kept the language kind of neutral on the</text>
  <text start="2411.619" dur="3.811">website because I&amp;#39;m just doing what the</text>

  <text start="2422.09" dur="5.13">knowing about these things very wisely</text>
  <text start="2423.47" dur="6.27">and she is trying to tone down the</text>
  <text start="2427.22" dur="4.86">religious jargon right because a lot of</text>
  <text start="2429.74" dur="4.83">people that are in that group yeah</text>
  <text start="2432.08" dur="4.77">they&amp;#39;re their assignment is to reach new</text>
  <text start="2434.57" dur="4.98">agers and Wiccans and other people and</text>
  <text start="2436.85" dur="5.07">atheists and agnostics who really get</text>
  <text start="2439.55" dur="4.8">turned off by religious nonsense and I</text>
  <text start="2441.92" dur="4.26">think that God is doing some really</text>
  <text start="2444.35" dur="5.43">amazing stuff through people who are</text>
  <text start="2446.18" dur="6.39">willing to do things in a way that is</text>
  <text start="2449.78" dur="4.65">not going to be offensive to people that</text>
  <text start="2452.57" dur="3.99">are seeking seeking the light of God</text>
  <text start="2454.43" dur="4.44">really I&amp;#39;m having the same issue with</text>
  <text start="2456.56" dur="4.59">this latest book hearing God&amp;#39;s voice I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2458.87" dur="4.64">intentionally writing the book in such a</text>
  <text start="2461.15" dur="6.39">way that it won&amp;#39;t be offensive to</text>
  <text start="2463.51" dur="5.77">agnostics and atheists because I think</text>
  <text start="2467.54" dur="3.48">this of all the books that I&amp;#39;ll write</text>

  <text start="2495.02" dur="5.97">important for us to speak in a way that</text>
  <text start="2498.77" dur="4.32">is plain that is easy for anyone to</text>
  <text start="2500.99" dur="4.35">understand and even if the people don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="2513.83" dur="7.02">thing you know I&amp;#39;m going in ways that I</text>
  <text start="2517.43" dur="4.65">never thought I&amp;#39;d go a year ago if you</text>
  <text start="2520.85" dur="4.17">would have asked me about this I would</text>
  <text start="2522.08" dur="5.13">have said huh I was working on my my</text>

  <text start="2529.04" dur="4.68">that book you know I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="2531.35" dur="3.81">delved into that part of stuff but</text>
  <text start="2533.72" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s where I thought my focus was</text>
  <text start="2535.16" dur="3.75">going was toward that you know helping</text>
  <text start="2537.32" dur="3.72">women who&amp;#39;ve been in a verbally abusive</text>
  <text start="2538.91" dur="3.48">relationships get out of that and then</text>
  <text start="2541.04" dur="3.99">all of a sudden this comes out of</text>
  <text start="2542.39" dur="5.28">nowhere but this is yeah I first ran</text>
  <text start="2545.03" dur="6.51">into you when you were writing about the</text>
  <text start="2547.67" dur="8.04">verbal abuse actually and that wasn&amp;#39;t on</text>
  <text start="2551.54" dur="4.559">my radar so much but when I realized you</text>
  <text start="2555.71" dur="3.809">were</text>
  <text start="2556.099" dur="5.46">talking about frequencies and healing</text>
  <text start="2559.519" dur="4.56">and tuning and all this stuff I was like</text>
  <text start="2561.559" dur="4.68">that resonates and I need to find out</text>
  <text start="2564.079" dur="4.051">more about this so I&amp;#39;ll leave I put a</text>
  <text start="2566.239" dur="3.451">link to that book it&amp;#39;s called but words</text>
  <text start="2568.13" dur="4.469">will never hurt me and it&amp;#39;s basically</text>
  <text start="2569.69" dur="4.109">just a story because when I was going</text>
  <text start="2572.599" dur="3.99">through it myself</text>
  <text start="2573.799" dur="4.56">I wanted to read stories of real people</text>
  <text start="2576.589" dur="4.53">but all I could find was stuff about</text>
  <text start="2578.359" dur="4.021">counselors and so in writing my book and</text>
  <text start="2581.119" dur="3.39">what people are going through the same</text>
  <text start="2582.38" dur="4.469">thing oh I recognize that I recognize</text>
  <text start="2584.509" dur="4.32">that you know and and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2586.849" dur="3.571">I&amp;#39;m getting feedback on saying that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2588.829" dur="4.92">really ministered to them</text>
  <text start="2590.42" dur="5.25">because they saw me who I really was and</text>
  <text start="2593.749" dur="4.411">how I actually worked through things and</text>
  <text start="2595.67" dur="6.569">and came out victorious at the end</text>
  <text start="2598.16" dur="6.149">people loved transparency oh it&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="2602.239" dur="3.24">darn transparent which is I almost</text>
  <text start="2604.309" dur="2.31">didn&amp;#39;t put it out there for a while</text>
  <text start="2605.479" dur="3.57">because there&amp;#39;s some embarrassing stuff</text>
  <text start="2606.619" dur="4.5">in there but you know I have</text>
  <text start="2609.049" dur="4.71">embarrassing stuff in my in my books too</text>
  <text start="2611.119" dur="4.68">but people really respect and they love</text>
  <text start="2613.759" dur="4.681">transparency as an author it gives you</text>
  <text start="2615.799" dur="4.111">credibility it makes you a real person</text>
  <text start="2618.44" dur="2.72">that they can identify with because they</text>
  <text start="2619.91" dur="3.419">struggle with a lot of the same stuff</text>
  <text start="2621.16" dur="4.359">you thought that was going to be your</text>
  <text start="2623.329" dur="4.351">thing though yeah but it turned out to</text>
  <text start="2625.519" dur="4.53">be not really the main thing you think</text>
  <text start="2627.68" dur="11.159">the music is really the main thing I do</text>
  <text start="2630.049" dur="11.851">I do I do I mean right now today other</text>
  <text start="2638.839" dur="4.62">thing is not going away I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2641.9" dur="3.449">probably what&amp;#39;s going to happen is other</text>
  <text start="2643.459" dur="4.56">people are gonna come along aside and</text>
  <text start="2645.349" dur="6.45">help with that because there really is a</text>
  <text start="2648.019" dur="4.921">need for people in verbal really abusive</text>
  <text start="2651.799" dur="3.75">relationships to be able to have a</text>
  <text start="2652.94" dur="4.799">community to talk and deal with things</text>
  <text start="2655.549" dur="3.81">in a private setting people in an</text>
  <text start="2657.739" dur="2.88">abusive relationships don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="2659.359" dur="2.821">share with the world what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="2660.619" dur="3.9">especially if they&amp;#39;re in a dangerous</text>
  <text start="2662.18" dur="5.189">situation well there has to be some</text>
  <text start="2664.519" dur="4.861">privacy right well you know I think your</text>
  <text start="2667.369" dur="4.47">book is probably gonna do the same thing</text>
  <text start="2669.38" dur="3.479">that some of my books are doing back in</text>
  <text start="2671.839" dur="2.851">2012</text>
  <text start="2672.859" dur="4.38">I thought the main thing for me was</text>
  <text start="2674.69" dur="4.649">healing I really get need to get this</text>
  <text start="2677.239" dur="5.01">book out get this divine healing book</text>
  <text start="2679.339" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s gonna be a game changer and and</text>
  <text start="2682.249" dur="4.32">maybe my life is gonna be all about</text>
  <text start="2683.779" dur="3.411">teaching on healing well that was only</text>
  <text start="2686.569" dur="3.451">the beginning</text>
  <text start="2687.19" dur="5.2">that was literally the doorstep</text>
  <text start="2690.02" dur="5.3">because once the door opened I realized</text>
  <text start="2692.39" dur="5.49">oh there&amp;#39;s a lot more in this room than</text>
  <text start="2695.32" dur="3.79">theirs seeing in the spirit of theirs</text>
  <text start="2697.88" dur="2.49">traveling in the spirit and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2699.11" dur="2.4">deliverance and inner healing and</text>
  <text start="2700.37" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s all these other things I want to</text>
  <text start="2701.51" dur="5.85">write about so the cool thing about that</text>
  <text start="2704.42" dur="3.9">book is it&amp;#39;s not the really the main</text>
  <text start="2707.36" dur="3.75">thing for me anymore</text>
  <text start="2708.32" dur="5.4">but it has opened the discussion for a</text>
  <text start="2711.11" dur="4.41">lot of people it has explained things</text>
  <text start="2713.72" dur="4.91">about healing in a way that people can</text>
  <text start="2715.52" dur="5.07">relate to and it&amp;#39;s helped with a</text>
  <text start="2718.63" dur="3.88">community people who are trying to</text>
  <text start="2720.59" dur="4.68">understand healing in a more complete</text>

  <text start="2744.47" dur="5.01">response is really good sorry I decided</text>
  <text start="2746.66" dur="4.14">to write a novel it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="2749.48" dur="2.79">a heavy-duty novel it&amp;#39;s going to talk a</text>
  <text start="2750.8" dur="3.3">lot about traveling in the spirit going</text>
  <text start="2752.27" dur="5.64">into the heavens operating from the</text>
  <text start="2754.1" dur="6.84">heavenly realms but also I&amp;#39;m stealing a</text>
  <text start="2757.91" dur="6.8">page from CS Lewis&amp;#39;s playbook okay and</text>
  <text start="2760.94" dur="6.27">I&amp;#39;m going to have dialogue between a</text>
  <text start="2764.71" dur="4.42">junior demon and an elder demon and</text>

  <text start="2784.36" dur="4.57">but I do an audiobook I&amp;#39;m gonna need</text>
  <text start="2786.62" dur="4.89">some characters but I&amp;#39;m looking forward</text>
  <text start="2788.93" dur="4.47">to doing fiction because the writing</text>
  <text start="2791.51" dur="4.38">nonfiction it can be really structured</text>
  <text start="2793.4" dur="4.23">but writing fiction I find is very</text>
  <text start="2795.89" dur="3.87">unstructured it&amp;#39;s very creative and</text>
  <text start="2797.63" dur="4.68">again I&amp;#39;m dictating the Holy Spirit I</text>
  <text start="2799.76" dur="4.47">see these scenes in my mind of these</text>
  <text start="2802.31" dur="3.33">people talking to each other and I can</text>
  <text start="2804.23" dur="3.96">hear what they&amp;#39;re saying so I just</text>
  <text start="2805.64" dur="4.29">dictate all that stuff but the thing the</text>
  <text start="2808.19" dur="4.23">cool thing is like right now you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2809.93" dur="3.48">doing the music who knows a year or two</text>
  <text start="2812.42" dur="1.8">from now you may be doing something</text>
  <text start="2813.41" dur="3.03">completely different</text>
  <text start="2814.22" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re a forerunner and so are a lot of</text>
  <text start="2816.44" dur="4.02">us you get some breakthrough in a</text>
  <text start="2819.14" dur="3.6">certain area you get some really cool</text>
  <text start="2820.46" dur="3.33">revelation you show people what it looks</text>
  <text start="2822.74" dur="3.57">like you</text>
  <text start="2823.79" dur="5.49">demonstrate it you teach on it and then</text>
  <text start="2826.31" dur="6.51">the Lord says okay that&amp;#39;s cool but I got</text>
  <text start="2829.28" dur="4.92">something else I want to show you then</text>
  <text start="2832.82" dur="5.07">you&amp;#39;re moving on to something else</text>
  <text start="2834.2" dur="4.47">and people are like oh but that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2837.89" dur="3.63">he does</text>
  <text start="2838.67" dur="4.41">I mean your future is going to be there</text>
  <text start="2841.52" dur="5.31">will be other things that&amp;#39;ll come along</text>
  <text start="2843.08" dur="5.16">yeah I&amp;#39;m sure but I think the key is</text>
  <text start="2846.83" dur="4.26">like I said when I first started this</text>
  <text start="2848.24" dur="4.26">out is listen to the Holy Spirit and do</text>
  <text start="2851.09" dur="2.46">what he tells you to do even if you</text>
  <text start="2852.5" dur="2.97">don&amp;#39;t understand it</text>
  <text start="2853.55" dur="4.14">you know a lot of people ask me about my</text>
  <text start="2855.47" dur="5.55">music I&amp;#39;m like dude I&amp;#39;m clueless I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2857.69" dur="6.3">clueless in Moscow I just do what the</text>
  <text start="2861.02" dur="6.63">Holy Spirit told me to do but you know I</text>
  <text start="2863.99" dur="6.6">think that the magnitude of it is the</text>
  <text start="2867.65" dur="4.5">fact that having gone from being a</text>
  <text start="2870.59" dur="3.72">classical musician to looking at the</text>
  <text start="2872.15" dur="4.35">cute little black dots to just</text>
  <text start="2874.31" dur="3.54">completely letting myself go and letting</text>
  <text start="2876.5" dur="5.1">the whole spirit speak through me that</text>
  <text start="2877.85" dur="5.61">is a huge step for me it is a huge step</text>
  <text start="2881.6" dur="4.56">because most people who are creatives</text>
  <text start="2883.46" dur="5.91">but probably more so in music and</text>
  <text start="2886.16" dur="5.13">writing want to know what is the end</text>
  <text start="2889.37" dur="4.8">game what are we trying to accomplish</text>
  <text start="2891.29" dur="4.68">here how does this thing fit into the</text>
  <text start="2894.17" dur="4.44">puzzle and you&amp;#39;re sitting here really</text>
  <text start="2895.97" dur="4.8">going I don&amp;#39;t really know I just know</text>
  <text start="2898.61" dur="5.19">that it&amp;#39;s what he wanted me to do and</text>
  <text start="2900.77" dur="5.55">the thing is to again for me to be able</text>
  <text start="2903.8" dur="4.32">to tell other people if someone said to</text>
  <text start="2906.32" dur="3.81">me she because I don&amp;#39;t know a lot of</text>
  <text start="2908.12" dur="4.47">people who listen to their own music and</text>
  <text start="2910.13" dur="5.55">I enjoy listening to this music and</text>
  <text start="2912.59" dur="4.62">every time I listen to the same song in</text>
  <text start="2915.68" dur="3.63">6 or 7 different times</text>
  <text start="2917.21" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;ll do something totally the opposite</text>
  <text start="2919.31" dur="2.76">is what it did before</text>
  <text start="2920.75" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s what the Holy Spirit is speaking</text>
  <text start="2922.07" dur="6.78">through that song at that moment well</text>
  <text start="2924.77" dur="5.22">which I was expecting either you</text>
  <text start="2928.85" dur="7.02">probably don&amp;#39;t get that from Peter</text>
  <text start="2929.99" dur="7.92">Frampton I don&amp;#39;t think yeah and you know</text>
  <text start="2935.87" dur="4.02">my classical music friends don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="2937.91" dur="4.05">I haven&amp;#39;t really talked a lot about it</text>
  <text start="2939.89" dur="5.01">to those people because it&amp;#39;s out of</text>
  <text start="2941.96" dur="5.04">their realm of understanding and outside</text>
  <text start="2944.9" dur="4.02">the box outside the box and the people</text>
  <text start="2947" dur="4.68">in the church are looking at me because</text>
  <text start="2948.92" dur="6.06">when when you worship you&amp;#39;re used to</text>
  <text start="2951.68" dur="6.06">having some dude or dudette standing up</text>
  <text start="2954.98" dur="5.07">on the stage you know the band started</text>
  <text start="2957.74" dur="3.87">Dermer starts playing some personal</text>
  <text start="2960.05" dur="2.85">there starts flagging and they sing and</text>
  <text start="2961.61" dur="4.74">they leave the congregation and worship</text>
  <text start="2962.9" dur="5.04">I don&amp;#39;t do it that way right and my</text>
  <text start="2966.35" dur="3.53">favorite worship music in fact it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2967.94" dur="3.69">really hard for me to listen to</text>
  <text start="2969.88" dur="6.88">traditional praise and worship music</text>
  <text start="2971.63" dur="6.96">anymore after I heard Todd and Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="2976.76" dur="4.26">do their worship their prophetic worship</text>
  <text start="2978.59" dur="5.82">which really there&amp;#39;s no lyrics</text>
  <text start="2981.02" dur="5.43">there&amp;#39;s no you you either understand</text>
  <text start="2984.41" dur="4.2">what the Spirit is doing and taking and</text>
  <text start="2986.45" dur="4.46">you can kind of go along with it but</text>
  <text start="2988.61" dur="4.41">most of it is just kind of spontaneous</text>
  <text start="2990.91" dur="4.95">after I started listening to that music</text>
  <text start="2993.02" dur="7.44">it spoiled me for anything else the</text>
  <text start="2995.86" dur="7.74">inspired impromptu music of the Spirit</text>
  <text start="3000.46" dur="9.03">will ruin you for anything else</text>
  <text start="3003.6" dur="7.72">I think it is I think it is but you know</text>
  <text start="3009.49" dur="3.93">if you&amp;#39;re in that mindset where you just</text>
  <text start="3011.32" dur="3.27">have to have the sheet music and</text>
  <text start="3013.42" dur="4.05">everything&amp;#39;s arranged</text>
  <text start="3014.59" dur="6.09">you probably can&amp;#39;t understand real well</text>
  <text start="3017.47" dur="5.46">this prophetic inspired music but once</text>
  <text start="3020.68" dur="3.75">you get it you don&amp;#39;t really want to go</text>
  <text start="3022.93" dur="3.72">back to the other way I don&amp;#39;t think at</text>
  <text start="3024.43" dur="5.34">least I don&amp;#39;t the other thing that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3026.65" dur="5.25">finding is my knowledge of music theory</text>
  <text start="3029.77" dur="4.47">and you know having three degrees in</text>
  <text start="3031.9" dur="4.8">music you know I think oh we have to</text>
  <text start="3034.24" dur="4.68">throw that away no God is using that</text>
  <text start="3036.7" dur="4.95">because then I can turn around and later</text>
  <text start="3038.92" dur="5.22">on say okay that particular chord that</text>
  <text start="3041.65" dur="3.81">particular interval that&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="3044.14" dur="3.63">that that&amp;#39;s starting to mean something</text>
  <text start="3045.46" dur="3.84">right you know for the longest time I</text>
  <text start="3047.77" dur="3.78">couldn&amp;#39;t listen to classical music</text>
  <text start="3049.3" dur="3.93">because I taught music theory and sit</text>
  <text start="3051.55" dur="3.87">there oh there&amp;#39;s a Frenchman at sixth</text>
  <text start="3053.23" dur="4.26">chord leading to you know this said oh I</text>
  <text start="3055.42" dur="4.71">smell any a pulse in sixth chord you</text>
  <text start="3057.49" dur="4.71">know like ah don&amp;#39;t analyze the music</text>
  <text start="3060.13" dur="4.68">when you&amp;#39;re listening to it and so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3062.2" dur="5.669">too easy to do that but at the same</text>
  <text start="3064.81" dur="5.49">point we have this stuff because God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3067.869" dur="3.811">gonna use that somehow in our lives</text>
  <text start="3070.3" dur="3.72">I don&amp;#39;t know any other classical</text>
  <text start="3071.68" dur="4.97">musicians he&amp;#39;s doing anything like this</text>
  <text start="3074.02" dur="4.95">I don&amp;#39;t know very many Christian</text>
  <text start="3076.65" dur="3.91">classical musicians who&amp;#39;ve gone into the</text>
  <text start="3078.97" dur="3.51">realm of the spiritual stuff so I</text>
  <text start="3080.56" dur="5.82">haven&amp;#39;t had anybody to help me learn</text>
  <text start="3082.48" dur="7.379">this stuff well you are on a grand</text>
  <text start="3086.38" dur="5.19">adventure yeah and you are a forerunner</text>
  <text start="3089.859" dur="4.261">that&amp;#39;s what forerunners do they go</text>
  <text start="3091.57" dur="4.17">on the place where nobody&amp;#39;s broken trail</text>
  <text start="3094.12" dur="3.9">ahead of them and they start breaking</text>
  <text start="3095.74" dur="4.71">trail and doing experimenting and trying</text>
  <text start="3098.02" dur="3.69">new things and I just felt like this is</text>
  <text start="3100.45" dur="4.14">what God told me to do I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="3101.71" dur="5.01">get it and yeah I mean I love that about</text>
  <text start="3104.59" dur="4.71">the four runners that are friends of</text>
  <text start="3106.72" dur="3.81">mine because they don&amp;#39;t always</text>
  <text start="3109.3" dur="2.43">understand what they&amp;#39;re doing they just</text>
  <text start="3110.53" dur="3.66">know that this is what God wants me to</text>
  <text start="3111.73" dur="4.14">do and he has a reason for it so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3114.19" dur="4.26">going to do it then other people say</text>
  <text start="3115.87" dur="4.35">well what are you doing this for I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3118.45" dur="3.03">know and then I think there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="3120.22" dur="6.09">wrong with you but that&amp;#39;s where you have</text>
  <text start="3121.48" dur="7.65">to say this we don&amp;#39;t always have to have</text>
  <text start="3126.31" dur="4.68">a reason for everything right away yeah</text>
  <text start="3129.13" dur="3.81">the reason is because this is what the</text>
  <text start="3130.99" dur="5.16">Holy Spirit wants me to do I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3132.94" dur="4.65">understand it beyond that so and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3136.15" dur="3.78">tell you what there&amp;#39;s a lot of religious</text>
  <text start="3137.59" dur="4.41">people who if you don&amp;#39;t understand the</text>
  <text start="3139.93" dur="5.04">reason why you&amp;#39;re doing something it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3142" dur="5.01">probably of the devil yeah and you know</text>
  <text start="3144.97" dur="4.62">I have people even saying oh you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3147.01" dur="5.16">gonna do you know have this music used</text>
  <text start="3149.59" dur="4.29">for massage you&amp;#39;re gonna record the</text>
  <text start="3152.17" dur="3.09">chakra frequencies oh I don&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="3153.88" dur="3.39">any part of that and people have said</text>
  <text start="3155.26" dur="7.65">that to me I&amp;#39;m like well I&amp;#39;m sure they</text>
  <text start="3157.27" dur="8.04">have get out of your box dude I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3162.91" dur="5.37">know I&amp;#39;m just excited to see what God is</text>
  <text start="3165.31" dur="5.61">doing in all of this I&amp;#39;m excited too I</text>
  <text start="3168.28" dur="4.2">think that there&amp;#39;s I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3170.92" dur="4.68">probably going to be an avalanche that</text>
  <text start="3172.48" dur="5.79">you&amp;#39;re gonna set off it&amp;#39;s gonna come in</text>
  <text start="3175.6" dur="5.34">your wake of people who are gonna get it</text>
  <text start="3178.27" dur="4.38">and they&amp;#39;re gonna realize God really is</text>
  <text start="3180.94" dur="3.9">doing something new with music and we</text>
  <text start="3182.65" dur="4.83">need to get on board with it not that we</text>
  <text start="3184.84" dur="6.42">jettison all of the old stuff right like</text>
  <text start="3187.48" dur="7.83">that we incorporate some new stuff into</text>
  <text start="3191.26" dur="6.6">it and we have to be willing to say am i</text>
  <text start="3195.31" dur="4.71">get a step over here not knowing what</text>
  <text start="3197.86" dur="4.83">that is because a lot of things don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3200.02" dur="4.58">open up to you until you actually make</text>
  <text start="3202.69" dur="5.31">that step that&amp;#39;s where faith comes in</text>
  <text start="3204.6" dur="5.08">God didn&amp;#39;t ask you to understand what he</text>
  <text start="3208" dur="4.98">was telling you to do he asked you to</text>
  <text start="3209.68" dur="6.72">believe and obey and do it which is</text>
  <text start="3212.98" dur="5.61">where I&amp;#39;m at right now yep I love it</text>
  <text start="3216.4" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s it is exciting and you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3218.59" dur="3.6">like I said I&amp;#39;m not getting rid of all</text>
  <text start="3220.45" dur="4.17">the classical stuff because I still love</text>
  <text start="3222.19" dur="3.27">it I mean give me a bronze clarinets nod</text>
  <text start="3224.62" dur="2.43">I&amp;#39;ll play that</text>
  <text start="3225.46" dur="4.77">because I&amp;#39;m just passionate about</text>
  <text start="3227.05" dur="5.64">certain pieces and when my students play</text>
  <text start="3230.23" dur="5.16">them I sit there and I&amp;#39;m like I conduct</text>
  <text start="3232.69" dur="4.35">with my arms you know because I I was</text>
  <text start="3235.39" dur="3.39">thinking about this when this student</text>
  <text start="3237.04" dur="4.41">who&amp;#39;s playing a the Brahms a flat</text>
  <text start="3238.78" dur="4.23">clarinet sonata in his recital and I</text>
  <text start="3241.45" dur="3.24">would stand there in the recital hall</text>
  <text start="3243.01" dur="4.41">with his pianist over there and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3244.69" dur="4.32">using my hands to direct the music and</text>
  <text start="3247.42" dur="3.54">I&amp;#39;m sitting here and then the holy</text>
  <text start="3249.01" dur="3.87">spirit quickened to me you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3250.96" dur="5.37">doing something in the spirit with those</text>
  <text start="3252.88" dur="5.37">motions and it it changed the way he</text>
  <text start="3256.33" dur="3.539">played because why can&amp;#39;t you be standing</text>
  <text start="3258.25" dur="11.04">next to me in the recital I still get it</text>
  <text start="3259.869" dur="11.73">when you do that so I know that motion</text>
  <text start="3269.29" dur="5.16">you know it all creates frequency so</text>
  <text start="3271.599" dur="4.711">when we&amp;#39;re in worship services and we</text>
  <text start="3274.45" dur="4.05">see someone flagging or someone doing a</text>
  <text start="3276.31" dur="3.99">little dance or something we got to get</text>
  <text start="3278.5" dur="4.05">out of our religious minds and think</text>
  <text start="3280.3" dur="3.539">okay the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s obviously doing</text>
  <text start="3282.55" dur="3.33">something and it&amp;#39;s not us to judge</text>
  <text start="3283.839" dur="3.27">whether that&amp;#39;s right or wrong yeah we</text>
  <text start="3285.88" dur="2.969">need to get out of the mindset that we</text>
