  <text start="140.37" dur="9.51">that the united nations has its general</text>
  <text start="145.98" dur="7.62">counsel at a vote to condemn the actions</text>
  <text start="149.88" dur="6.75">of the president to decide to declare I</text>
  <text start="153.6" dur="5.7">recognize Jerusalem as a capital and</text>
  <text start="156.63" dur="6.9">move our embassy a lot of nations voted</text>

  <text start="196.29" dur="5.94">president and America so not a whole lot</text>

  <text start="202.23" dur="8.18">little bit of a you know some bad PR but</text>

  <text start="239.07" dur="5.69">actually Anthony Edwards was one of the</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="4.83">child actors who accused him of</text>
  <text start="244.76" dur="6.97">basically sexually abusing him when he</text>
  <text start="247.26" dur="8.55">was a teenager so you know Hollywood&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.73" dur="7.11">getting some more bad PR and look if</text>

  <text start="285.5" dur="7.699">being exposed it&amp;#39;s coming out so we need</text>
  <text start="288.56" dur="9.99">to keep praying into that jeff sessions</text>
  <text start="293.199" dur="8.081">announced that he is directing his</text>
  <text start="298.55" dur="5.66">attorneys in the attorney general&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.28" dur="5.669">office in Department of Justice to</text>
  <text start="304.21" dur="7.86">interview people in the FBI about</text>
  <text start="306.949" dur="8.94">uranium 1 now we know I think it was a</text>
  <text start="312.07" dur="6.219">month ago November 11th I think he wrote</text>
  <text start="315.889" dur="4.71">a letter to Congress letting them know</text>
  <text start="318.289" dur="5.821">that they were going to reopen a lot of</text>
  <text start="320.599" dur="5.611">cold cases and try to determine if</text>
  <text start="324.11" dur="4.529">further investigation was required if</text>
  <text start="326.21" dur="4.53">any of them needed special counsel if</text>
  <text start="328.639" dur="4.231">any of them needed more resources</text>
  <text start="330.74" dur="6.47">included in that is the investigation</text>
  <text start="332.87" dur="8.63">into the Clinton Foundation uranium one</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="7.03">let&amp;#39;s see commis handling of the email</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="4.81">investigation a lot of those issues that</text>
  <text start="344.24" dur="4.44">people are concerned about sessions</text>
  <text start="346.31" dur="5.94">notified Congress they&amp;#39;re reopening and</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="6.209">looking into all of that so the</text>
  <text start="352.25" dur="5.49">interesting news and now the mainstream</text>
  <text start="354.889" dur="5.641">media has sat on this news for about a</text>
  <text start="357.74" dur="4.59">month and they haven&amp;#39;t really wanted to</text>
  <text start="360.53" dur="3.81">report it I mean Fox News reported and</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="3.24">Sarah Carter John Solomon have reported</text>
  <text start="364.34" dur="3.66">it there hasn&amp;#39;t really been a whole lot</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="4.92">more coverage other than that and now</text>
  <text start="368" dur="5.849">today the mainstream media is finally</text>
  <text start="370.49" dur="6.899">talking about uranium one that you might</text>
  <text start="373.849" dur="5.91">ask yourself the question why is the</text>
  <text start="377.389" dur="5.491">mainstream media now reporting on</text>
  <text start="379.759" dur="5.9">uranium one when this is a story that</text>
  <text start="382.88" dur="9.65">broke five weeks ago</text>
  <text start="385.659" dur="9.73">why why now well it could be that they</text>
  <text start="392.53" dur="7.24">know that there are going to be arrests</text>
  <text start="395.389" dur="7.411">and indictments soon and what happens to</text>
  <text start="399.77" dur="8.94">the base of support the people who</text>
  <text start="402.8" dur="8.04">follow CNN NBC ABC and CBS what happens</text>
  <text start="408.71" dur="5.07">if they get completely caught off guard</text>
  <text start="410.84" dur="4.71">and they don&amp;#39;t realize why these people</text>
  <text start="413.78" dur="4.139">are being arrested because the media has</text>
  <text start="415.55" dur="4.5">never told them that this uranium one</text>
  <text start="417.919" dur="4.261">thing was a big deal so I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="3.48">in a position now whether we&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="422.18" dur="4.47">going to see indictments and arrests</text>
  <text start="423.53" dur="6.6">coming soon I think the the liberal</text>
  <text start="426.65" dur="6.6">media doesn&amp;#39;t have any choice now they</text>
  <text start="430.13" dur="5.25">have to report it they don&amp;#39;t want to but</text>
  <text start="433.25" dur="7.319">they have to because the arrests are</text>
  <text start="435.38" dur="6.96">coming so that is something to think</text>
  <text start="440.569" dur="5.791">about another thing that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="442.34" dur="9.329">interesting about this is a timing issue</text>
  <text start="446.36" dur="7.44">I&amp;#39;m always looking at timing and the</text>
  <text start="451.669" dur="3.961">timing of this to me is interesting</text>
  <text start="453.8" dur="5.58">because Robert Muller&amp;#39;s investigation is</text>
  <text start="455.63" dur="5.49">probably wrapping up and Robert Muller</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="6.56">is one of the players who could</text>
  <text start="461.12" dur="7.049">potentially be hit with some fire in</text>
  <text start="465.94" dur="5.08">relation to this uranium one thing</text>
  <text start="468.169" dur="7.201">because Muller was head of the FBI when</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="8.07">the uranium one scandal went down when</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="6.419">uranium 1 was transferred to the Russian</text>
  <text start="479.09" dur="7.35">company Raza Tom Muller was head of the</text>
  <text start="481.789" dur="8.341">FBI rod Rosenstein was US Attorney in</text>
  <text start="486.44" dur="6.69">Maryland where the prosecution there was</text>
  <text start="490.13" dur="5.31">a Russian guy who is prosecuted for</text>
  <text start="493.13" dur="4.49">bribery kickbacks and extortion that</text>
  <text start="495.44" dur="5.52">happened in rod Rosen Stein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.62" dur="4.93">jurisdiction in Maryland and there is</text>
  <text start="500.96" dur="3.269">this question in the minds of a lot of</text>
  <text start="502.55" dur="4.44">people is Rosen Stein going to be</text>
  <text start="504.229" dur="6">implicated because there should have</text>
  <text start="506.99" dur="8.15">been more people prosecuted probably and</text>
  <text start="510.229" dur="7.56">there weren&amp;#39;t so Rosenstein and Muller</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="5.939">both could potentially face some</text>
  <text start="517.789" dur="6">exposure to questioning at least and</text>
  <text start="521.079" dur="4.901">maybe criminal investigation and this is</text>
  <text start="523.789" dur="4.281">very bad very bad timing for Muller as</text>
  <text start="525.98" dur="5.01">his investigation is coming to a close</text>
  <text start="528.07" dur="4.459">now the spotlight is on uranium 1 and</text>
  <text start="530.99" dur="5.25">people are going to be questioning what</text>
  <text start="532.529" dur="6.18">Muller play in this uranium one thing</text>
  <text start="536.24" dur="5.019">the timing couldn&amp;#39;t be worse for Muller</text>
  <text start="538.709" dur="4.141">his and his team is being exposed his</text>
  <text start="541.259" dur="4.32">investigation is kind of falling apart</text>
  <text start="542.85" dur="6.87">and now he has to deal with uranium one</text>
  <text start="545.579" dur="6.99">hitting the newspapers again so I find</text>
  <text start="549.72" dur="5.58">the timing very interesting and the</text>
  <text start="552.569" dur="6.57">other issue is Rosenstein I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="555.3" dur="7.019">what what degree Rosenstein may or may</text>
  <text start="559.139" dur="6.3">not be involved in any wrongdoing but if</text>
  <text start="562.319" dur="6.87">frozen Stein has some dirt that he needs</text>
  <text start="565.439" dur="4.95">to cover this this is gonna could</text>
  <text start="569.189" dur="3.06">potentially be an issue people are gonna</text>
  <text start="570.389" dur="5.791">ask questions about what his role was so</text>
  <text start="572.249" dur="7.95">two people to keep in mind as things</text>
  <text start="576.18" dur="7.17">move forward and one of the other things</text>
  <text start="580.199" dur="6.69">that is good to know about I was reading</text>
  <text start="583.35" dur="5.07">the I think it was the NBC let me double</text>
  <text start="586.889" dur="5.091">check and I wanna I don&amp;#39;t want to lie</text>
  <text start="588.42" dur="6.359">about this I think it was the NBC report</text>
  <text start="591.98" dur="7.51">that was talking about uranium 1:00 this</text>
  <text start="594.779" dur="7.8">morning yeah I was NBC and of course</text>
  <text start="599.49" dur="6.209">being who they are they have their one</text>
  <text start="602.579" dur="4.591">of their arguments and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="605.699" dur="2.43">quoted Hillary Hillary said this whole</text>
  <text start="607.17" dur="3.18">thing has been debunked</text>
  <text start="608.129" dur="4.801">it&amp;#39;s an old investigation it&amp;#39;s over</text>
  <text start="610.35" dur="4.02">there is no scandal you know her thing</text>
  <text start="612.93" dur="4.56">is it&amp;#39;s all been debunked nothing to</text>
  <text start="614.37" dur="4.8">worry about one of the objections that</text>
  <text start="617.49" dur="4.68">people have raised about this uranium</text>
  <text start="619.17" dur="7.219">one thing is that uranium one did not</text>
  <text start="622.17" dur="8.19">have a license to export uranium</text>
  <text start="626.389" dur="7">therefore how could anyone accuse them</text>
  <text start="630.36" dur="5.039">of transferring uranium to Russia or any</text>
  <text start="633.389" dur="5.88">other country outside of the US because</text>
  <text start="635.399" dur="6.201">uranium one never was given a permit by</text>
  <text start="639.269" dur="6.211">the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to</text>
  <text start="641.6" dur="5.919">export uranium well it&amp;#39;s true that</text>
  <text start="645.48" dur="4.919">uranium one didn&amp;#39;t have an export</text>
  <text start="647.519" dur="6.81">license but one of their vendors did</text>
  <text start="650.399" dur="7.41">they subcontracted with transport</text>
  <text start="654.329" dur="9">logistics and transport logistics has a</text>
  <text start="657.809" dur="7.95">license to export uranium so it is very</text>
  <text start="663.329" dur="2.821">likely that uranium was being exported</text>
  <text start="665.759" dur="3.481">out</text>
  <text start="666.15" dur="6.09">the country under this arrangement and</text>
  <text start="669.24" dur="7.98">they kind of hid the paperwork it took</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="8.64">some very detailed investigative work to</text>
  <text start="677.22" dur="8.28">find that out but anyway that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="680.88" dur="7.83">information that&amp;#39;s good to know so</text>
  <text start="685.5" dur="4.98">moving along to the question of why is</text>
  <text start="688.71" dur="4.41">Congress having all these closed</text>
  <text start="690.48" dur="6.39">hearings why don&amp;#39;t they have open</text>
  <text start="693.12" dur="5.7">hearings the House Intelligence and</text>
  <text start="696.87" dur="4.14">Judiciary Committee&amp;#39;s when they go and</text>
  <text start="698.82" dur="5.16">they bring in these witnesses Andrew</text>
  <text start="701.01" dur="6.87">McCabe and Bruce or and all these other</text>
  <text start="703.98" dur="6.21">people people are frustrated and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="707.88" dur="3.69">kind of angry because they don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="710.19" dur="3.48">the government they don&amp;#39;t trust Congress</text>
  <text start="711.57" dur="3.78">and they think look if you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="713.67" dur="4.73">anything to hide why not have open</text>
  <text start="715.35" dur="8.07">hearings why do they have to be closed</text>
  <text start="718.4" dur="8.2">well I I have a reason why I think they</text>
  <text start="723.42" dur="5.28">do that part of it is because there is</text>
  <text start="726.6" dur="7.38">classified information being discussed</text>
  <text start="728.7" dur="9.09">you are correct members of Congress</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="6.5">don&amp;#39;t actually have security clearances</text>
  <text start="737.79" dur="5.88">they don&amp;#39;t need security clearance</text>
  <text start="740.48" dur="4.96">members of the Defense Intelligence</text>
  <text start="743.67" dur="5.01">Agency the National Security Council</text>
  <text start="745.44" dur="5.82">people who work in CIA and FBI they need</text>
  <text start="748.68" dur="5.61">security clearances members of Congress</text>
  <text start="751.26" dur="4.38">don&amp;#39;t get security clearances if you are</text>
  <text start="754.29" dur="4.71">on a committee and intelligence</text>
  <text start="755.64" dur="4.74">committee whatever you are assumed to</text>
  <text start="759" dur="4.05">have a right to know</text>
  <text start="760.38" dur="4.11">so whatever classified information and</text>
  <text start="763.05" dur="3.02">need to present these hearings they can</text>
  <text start="764.49" dur="4.65">do that you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about a</text>
  <text start="766.07" dur="4.75">security clearance but there is</text>
  <text start="769.14" dur="3.57">information that they talk about in</text>
  <text start="770.82" dur="3.21">these hearings it is classified so the</text>
  <text start="772.71" dur="3.21">if they&amp;#39;re going to talk about</text>
  <text start="774.03" dur="3.69">classified information they have to go</text>
  <text start="775.92" dur="3.96">to closed session because we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="777.72" dur="6.27">a right to know that stuff that&amp;#39;s number</text>
  <text start="779.88" dur="8.16">one but more importantly this is an</text>
  <text start="783.99" dur="5.58">investigation okay they the</text>
  <text start="788.04" dur="6.09">congressional committees are</text>
  <text start="789.57" dur="8.22">investigating potential crime the people</text>
  <text start="794.13" dur="5.94">who testify are witnesses and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="797.79" dur="6.239">potentially targets and suspects</text>
  <text start="800.07" dur="5.43">now let me ask you this if you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="804.029" dur="8.911">an investigation a criminal</text>
  <text start="805.5" dur="11.1">investigation and you have 10 suspects</text>
  <text start="812.94" dur="5.67">who are all involved in a scheme maybe</text>
  <text start="816.6" dur="4.56">you know that involves bribery kickbacks</text>
  <text start="818.61" dur="4.8">extortion who knows is a scheme and you</text>
  <text start="821.16" dur="3.599">have ten different suspects and you need</text>
  <text start="823.41" dur="4.77">to interview all of them and get</text>
  <text start="824.759" dur="5.06">statements from all of them do you put</text>
  <text start="828.18" dur="3.81">them all in the same room and</text>
  <text start="829.819" dur="5.32">interrogate them all at the same time</text>
  <text start="831.99" dur="8.969">and let all of them hear the testimony</text>
  <text start="835.139" dur="8.01">of the other suspects no you don&amp;#39;t why</text>
  <text start="840.959" dur="3.951">do you not interrogate all of your</text>
  <text start="843.149" dur="6.391">suspects together in the same room</text>
  <text start="844.91" dur="8.679">because you want them each individual to</text>
  <text start="849.54" dur="7.32">testify privately get their story ask</text>
  <text start="853.589" dur="6.3">them questions and then interrogate</text>
  <text start="856.86" dur="5.52">another suspect and you match up their</text>
  <text start="859.889" dur="3.841">testimonies and you see if any of them</text>
  <text start="862.38" dur="4.889">are lying or if they&amp;#39;re telling the</text>
  <text start="863.73" dur="5.31">truth you take another suspect and you</text>
  <text start="867.269" dur="3.211">interrogate them privately you take</text>
  <text start="869.04" dur="4.109">another suspect interrogate them</text>
  <text start="870.48" dur="5.099">privately that is how you determine if</text>
  <text start="873.149" dur="5.031">they&amp;#39;re lying if all of their stories</text>
  <text start="875.579" dur="5.06">match up or if all of the stories are</text>
  <text start="878.18" dur="4.83">inconsistent that is how you determine</text>
  <text start="880.639" dur="6.07">whether they&amp;#39;re telling you the truth</text>
  <text start="883.01" dur="6.569">now think about this if Andrew McCabe&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="886.709" dur="6.601">hearings over the last two days and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="889.579" dur="7.891">he was testifying today was test was</text>
  <text start="893.31" dur="10.469">public publicly available Jim Comey</text>
  <text start="897.47" dur="7.27">Susan Rice Eric Holder pre step and all</text>
  <text start="903.779" dur="2.55">the other people they could all be</text>
  <text start="904.74" dur="3.36">watching in and listening to the</text>
  <text start="906.329" dur="3.541">questions they could hear his answers</text>
  <text start="908.1" dur="5.37">they if all of these hearings were</text>
  <text start="909.87" dur="6.3">public they would know the other people</text>
  <text start="913.47" dur="4.229">would know the other witnesses would</text>
  <text start="916.17" dur="3.18">know exactly what McCabe said and they</text>
  <text start="917.699" dur="4.711">would all line up their stories so</text>
  <text start="919.35" dur="7.969">everyone&amp;#39;s on the same page you get them</text>
  <text start="922.41" dur="9.21">in a closed hearing because you need to</text>
  <text start="927.319" dur="6.521">interview them individually so that they</text>
  <text start="931.62" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t have an opportunity to tell</text>
  <text start="933.84" dur="6.84">each other and get on the same page that</text>
  <text start="937.26" dur="4.86">way through sequential hearings you find</text>
  <text start="940.68" dur="5.64">out who&amp;#39;s lying and who&amp;#39;s telling the</text>
  <text start="942.12" dur="5.82">truth and about what issues now here is</text>
  <text start="946.32" dur="4.26">where it takes a very interesting</text>
  <text start="947.94" dur="5.16">wrinkle so there are different</text>
  <text start="950.58" dur="4.17">congressional committees there is the</text>
  <text start="953.1" dur="3.42">House Intelligence there is Senate</text>
  <text start="954.75" dur="4.74">Intelligence there is House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="956.52" dur="5.07">there is Senate Judiciary Judiciary and</text>
  <text start="959.49" dur="3.57">House Intelligence both are involved</text>
  <text start="961.59" dur="3.66">with oversight of the Department of</text>
  <text start="963.06" dur="4.89">Justice and FBI okay</text>
  <text start="965.25" dur="5.16">you have different committees with</text>
  <text start="967.95" dur="5.31">different people and you can have those</text>
  <text start="970.41" dur="7.05">witnesses testify at multiple hearings</text>
  <text start="973.26" dur="6.9">with multiple panels that are asking</text>
  <text start="977.46" dur="5.79">different questions this makes it very</text>
  <text start="980.16" dur="4.89">difficult to lie if you are being asked</text>
  <text start="983.25" dur="4.23">questions by different committees at</text>
  <text start="985.05" dur="6.15">different times and you&amp;#39;re lying it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="987.48" dur="6.03">hard to lie consistently so putting</text>
  <text start="991.2" dur="4.74">these witnesses or targets if you want</text>
  <text start="993.51" dur="4.41">to call them in different hearings with</text>
  <text start="995.94" dur="4.7">different groups of people asking</text>
  <text start="997.92" dur="6.6">different lines of questioning is a</text>
  <text start="1000.64" dur="9.43">really good way to determine what the</text>
  <text start="1004.52" dur="7.05">truth is and what the lies are and here</text>
  <text start="1010.07" dur="5.01">is the last thing I&amp;#39;m going to share</text>
  <text start="1011.57" dur="6.48">with you it was just announced yesterday</text>
  <text start="1015.08" dur="7.89">that Devin Nunez who is chair of the</text>
  <text start="1018.05" dur="8.85">House Intelligence Committee is running</text>
  <text start="1022.97" dur="7.79">his own parallel investigation into the</text>
  <text start="1026.9" dur="6.18">FBI and DOJ that doesn&amp;#39;t allow any</text>
  <text start="1030.76" dur="5.29">Democrats to be involved in</text>
  <text start="1033.08" dur="8.129">investigation it&amp;#39;s a very interesting</text>
  <text start="1036.05" dur="8.55">revelation why would Devin Nunez who is</text>
  <text start="1041.209" dur="5.431">the Republican set up a parallel</text>
  <text start="1044.6" dur="4.59">investigation into the FBI and DOJ that</text>
  <text start="1046.64" dur="11.22">doesn&amp;#39;t have any Democrats involved in</text>
  <text start="1049.19" dur="10.8">the process why because he knows that</text>
  <text start="1057.86" dur="5.19">people like Adam Schiff who is the</text>
  <text start="1059.99" dur="6.45">ranking minority member on his committee</text>
  <text start="1063.05" dur="4.24">is leaking to the press well he suspects</text>
  <text start="1066.44" dur="3.04">it</text>
  <text start="1067.29" dur="4.44">that Adam Schiff and potentially other</text>
  <text start="1069.48" dur="4.71">people are leaking the information in</text>
  <text start="1071.73" dur="4.5">their hearings to the press so if you</text>
  <text start="1074.19" dur="4.14">are Devon Eunice and you want an</text>
  <text start="1076.23" dur="2.82">investigation that is not going to be</text>
  <text start="1078.33" dur="3.96">leaked to the press</text>
  <text start="1079.05" dur="4.83">you get the leakers out of the system so</text>
  <text start="1082.29" dur="3.96">Nunez is running his own investigation</text>
  <text start="1083.88" dur="4.59">and he&amp;#39;s trying to make sure the leakers</text>
  <text start="1086.25" dur="7.29">don&amp;#39;t get in so the information they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1088.47" dur="7.98">trying to get is not being leaked I just</text>
  <text start="1093.54" dur="5.58">find this incredibly interesting that</text>
  <text start="1096.45" dur="4.74">you know there&amp;#39;s all this deception and</text>
  <text start="1099.12" dur="5.67">palace intrigue and there&amp;#39;s leaking and</text>
  <text start="1101.19" dur="7.1">there&amp;#39;s deception and it&amp;#39;s just to me</text>
  <text start="1104.79" dur="7.56">it&amp;#39;s just really I find it fascinating</text>
  <text start="1108.29" dur="6.58">and it shows you how smart these people</text>
  <text start="1112.35" dur="4.8">are these these people are running these</text>
  <text start="1114.87" dur="4.05">committees they have thought this out</text>
  <text start="1117.15" dur="4.02">and they&amp;#39;ve planned it and its strategic</text>
  <text start="1118.92" dur="4.11">the reason why there&amp;#39;s multiple</text>
  <text start="1121.17" dur="4.92">committees multiple investigations is</text>
  <text start="1123.03" dur="5.16">because they need the people in the FBI</text>
  <text start="1126.09" dur="3.69">and the DOJ who are being investigated</text>
  <text start="1128.19" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re very smart</text>
  <text start="1129.78" dur="5.52">they&amp;#39;re very wily crafty people and if</text>
  <text start="1133.5" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re going to get to the truth you</text>
  <text start="1135.3" dur="7.35">have to very methodically put this</text>
  <text start="1138.51" dur="6.39">investigation together so that is that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1142.65" dur="3.99">my analysis of why these hearings are</text>
  <text start="1144.9" dur="4.08">going down the way they are I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1146.64" dur="4.83">think that they&amp;#39;re pointless I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1148.98" dur="4.47">think that they are a waste of time and</text>
  <text start="1151.47" dur="6.3">money they&amp;#39;re doing some very important</text>
  <text start="1153.45" dur="7.56">work it is a long arduous process we</text>
  <text start="1157.77" dur="7.02">wish it was all over but you know it is</text>
  <text start="1161.01" dur="6.6">what it is yes we need to keep praying</text>
  <text start="1164.79" dur="4.47">we need to keep praying that the truth</text>
  <text start="1167.61" dur="5.07">would be exposed the truth would come</text>
  <text start="1169.26" dur="7.2">out darkness exposed that criminals</text>
  <text start="1172.68" dur="8.19">would be prosecuted and that the</text>
  <text start="1176.46" dur="9.78">righteous will prevail and Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="1180.87" dur="10.32">is not sleeping Jeff Sessions has never</text>
  <text start="1186.24" dur="7.31">been sleeping that is Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="1191.19" dur="7.08">operating like a b-2 stealth bomber</text>
  <text start="1193.55" dur="5.77">supposed to go quiet undetected and you</text>
  <text start="1198.27" dur="1.61">don&amp;#39;t want to draw any attention to</text>
  <text start="1199.32" dur="2.01">yourself</text>
  <text start="1199.88" dur="3.76">especially in a</text>
  <text start="1201.33" dur="4.11">highly politicized environment you want</text>
  <text start="1203.64" dur="3.48">everyone to think you are not paying</text>
  <text start="1205.44" dur="3.78">attention at all that&amp;#39;s what you want</text>
  <text start="1207.12" dur="6.48">and sessions has been playing his hand</text>
  <text start="1209.22" dur="5.88">pretty well so all right that is all I</text>
  <text start="1213.6" dur="3.87">have for you today oh wait hang on a</text>
