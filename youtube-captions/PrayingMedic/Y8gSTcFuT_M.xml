  <text start="493.76" dur="6.82">he became a very generous man he just</text>
  <text start="498.03" dur="6.15">gave his money away he gave his money</text>
  <text start="500.58" dur="5.52">away freely and he did that because he</text>
  <text start="504.18" dur="4.53">had a different understanding of the</text>
  <text start="506.1" dur="4.65">reality of God&amp;#39;s kingdom and God&amp;#39;s heart</text>
  <text start="508.71" dur="4.56">and that is there is no lack you don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="514.589" dur="4.801">he will his his kingdom is abundant and</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="3.299">this man began to give out of the</text>
  <text start="519.39" dur="3.99">abundance that he had out of a</text>
  <text start="520.919" dur="4.741">realization in his mind that God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="6.72">kingdom and God&amp;#39;s heart is one of</text>

  <text start="538.26" dur="9.48">who the one thing I had always wanted</text>
  <text start="541.71" dur="8.4">was acceptance by others in fact the the</text>
  <text start="547.74" dur="4.26">virtual mental construct I have lived</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="6.75">with most of my life until I met Denise</text>
  <text start="552" dur="7.62">I lived with the lie that no one will</text>
  <text start="556.86" dur="5.37">ever understand me and when you live</text>
  <text start="559.62" dur="5.88">your entire life believing no one will</text>
  <text start="562.23" dur="5.79">ever understand you it is a very</text>
  <text start="565.5" dur="9.09">frustrating thing eventually you give up</text>
  <text start="568.02" dur="10.74">and you stop trying to be understood so</text>
  <text start="574.59" dur="6.09">in this dream in the world what I wanted</text>
  <text start="578.76" dur="5.55">was acceptance understanding that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="580.68" dur="8.04">I wanted and I I did a lot of the things</text>
  <text start="584.31" dur="7.89">that I did the jokes and the sarcasm and</text>
  <text start="588.72" dur="10.17">the things that I everyday things to be</text>
  <text start="592.2" dur="9.75">accepted right so I was I behaved a</text>
  <text start="598.89" dur="5.01">certain way because I wanted others to</text>
  <text start="601.95" dur="8.31">perceive me a certain way I want to be</text>
  <text start="603.9" dur="11.01">accepted I met God the Father and I</text>
  <text start="610.26" dur="7.65">realized he knew everything about me all</text>
  <text start="614.91" dur="5.16">my weaknesses all my flaws my faults all</text>
  <text start="617.91" dur="4.26">the stupid things that I did all my</text>

  <text start="622.17" dur="6.72">everything about me and he thought I was</text>
  <text start="626.49" dur="5.73">the bee&amp;#39;s knees he laughed at all my</text>
  <text start="628.89" dur="6.72">stupid jokes he he treated me like a</text>
  <text start="632.22" dur="5.25">friend he I could tell he loved me I</text>
  <text start="635.61" dur="5.75">could tell he was incredibly proud of me</text>
  <text start="637.47" dur="8.18">I could tell he accepted me completely</text>
  <text start="641.36" dur="7.9">almost as if he didn&amp;#39;t even know about</text>
  <text start="645.65" dur="4.12">my faults and my weaknesses he accepted</text>
  <text start="649.26" dur="3.87">me completely</text>

  <text start="655.43" dur="6.25">he just thought it was like the most</text>
  <text start="657.57" dur="6.48">awesome person in the world and I came</text>
  <text start="661.68" dur="8.909">out of that experience</text>
  <text start="664.05" dur="7.769">in the dream and I no longer lived for</text>
  <text start="670.589" dur="6.66">the acceptance of others</text>
  <text start="671.819" dur="7.851">I lived knowing that the God who created</text>
  <text start="677.249" dur="4.56">the universe thought I was okay and once</text>
  <text start="679.67" dur="2.62">the god of the universe thinks you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="737.61" dur="6.719">you to regularly think on the fact that</text>
  <text start="742.499" dur="2.45">God absolutely loves you and thinks</text>
  <text start="744.329" dur="3.781">you&amp;#39;re amazing</text>

  <text start="748.11" dur="1.979">your life</text>
  <text start="748.589" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;ll change the way you perceive</text>
  <text start="750.089" dur="3.631">yourself it&amp;#39;ll change the way your you</text>
  <text start="752.429" dur="6.9">perceive others then it&amp;#39;ll change the</text>
  <text start="753.72" dur="9.839">way you interact with others and look I</text>
  <text start="759.329" dur="5.521">I learned a long time ago partially from</text>
  <text start="763.559" dur="5">teaching from good men but also</text>
  <text start="764.85" dur="9.229">partially from experience that it is a</text>
  <text start="768.559" dur="8.5">waste of time to try to please people</text>
  <text start="774.079" dur="6.06">who cannot be pleased no matter what you</text>
  <text start="777.059" dur="9.12">do for them people-pleasing is as a trap</text>
  <text start="780.139" dur="10.901">it is also a waste of time to try to</text>
  <text start="786.179" dur="7.2">convince people about your what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="791.04" dur="5.54">all about when those people are</text>
  <text start="793.379" dur="5.371">determined to misunderstand you</text>
  <text start="796.58" dur="5.11">there are a lot of people in the world</text>
  <text start="798.75" dur="4.68">who have no interest in understanding</text>
  <text start="801.69" dur="4.11">you and they don&amp;#39;t want to understand me</text>
  <text start="803.43" dur="3.96">they take a look at one or two things</text>
  <text start="805.8" dur="3.72">that we say or do and they make a</text>
  <text start="807.39" dur="4.14">judgment about us and they have no</text>
  <text start="809.52" dur="6.84">intention and no desire to understand us</text>
  <text start="811.53" dur="6.69">and it is a very freeing thing when you</text>
  <text start="816.36" dur="5.58">stop trying to be understood by people</text>
  <text start="818.22" dur="7.26">and realize that the god of the heavens</text>
  <text start="821.94" dur="4.68">accepts you just the way you are God if</text>
  <text start="825.48" dur="2.52">it heavens accepts you the way you are</text>
  <text start="826.62" dur="6.41">it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what everybody</text>
  <text start="828" dur="10.58">else thinks that will bring you freedom</text>
  <text start="833.03" dur="8.38">and that is my story for today alright</text>

  <text start="846.51" dur="5.55">and the team being in some kind of like</text>
  <text start="848.58" dur="6.15">a spiritual battle I can&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="852.06" dur="5.16">specifically what is going on other than</text>
  <text start="854.73" dur="5.25">to say if you&amp;#39;re a cue follower even if</text>
  <text start="857.22" dur="6.03">you&amp;#39;re not I think we need to keep</text>
  <text start="859.98" dur="4.86">cueing the team in extra prayer I think</text>

  <text start="872.19" dur="3.9">the president in prayer every day until</text>
