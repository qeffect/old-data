  <text start="230.62" dur="5.37">Intelligence Committee whom you</text>
  <text start="232.03" dur="6.57">represent it is I believe unconscionable</text>
  <text start="235.99" dur="4.38">that some of these men and women and in</text>

  <text start="248.95" dur="5.16">shutdown this is no way to run a country</text>
  <text start="251.55" dur="4.78">we count on the intelligence and law</text>
  <text start="254.11" dur="5.64">enforcement professionals to protect us</text>
  <text start="256.33" dur="6.21">we cannot ask them to do so with no pay</text>
  <text start="259.75" dur="4.55">and facing threats of eviction or losing</text>
  <text start="262.54" dur="4.05">their health insurance</text>
  <text start="264.3" dur="4.899">the method of running government via</text>

  <text start="295.81" dur="5.46">those allies unquote I think that is a</text>
  <text start="298.84" dur="3.9">lesson we all need to take the heart of</text>
  <text start="301.27" dur="4.709">the multiple threats we face</text>
  <text start="302.74" dur="7.26">I would height like to that I hope we</text>
  <text start="305.979" dur="6">can especially dive into first Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="310" dur="4.62">use of social media to amplify the</text>
  <text start="311.979" dur="5.94">divisions in our society and to</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="5.609">influence our democratic process this is</text>
  <text start="317.919" dur="4.56">an area that I know was highlighted in</text>
  <text start="320.229" dur="5.461">our worldwide threat hearing last year</text>
  <text start="322.479" dur="4.831">and the concern that we and the IC that</text>
  <text start="325.69" dur="4.83">Russia would continue its malign</text>
  <text start="327.31" dur="6.18">activities to try to influence the 2018</text>
  <text start="330.52" dur="5.1">elections well we did see Russia</text>
  <text start="333.49" dur="5.64">continue to try to divide Americans on</text>
  <text start="335.62" dur="6.09">social media and we saw cyber activities</text>
  <text start="339.13" dur="5.039">by unknown actors targeting our election</text>
  <text start="341.71" dur="5.699">infrastructure in 20 and 18 the good</text>
  <text start="344.169" dur="5.881">news is General Michael sunny I commend</text>
  <text start="347.409" dur="4.801">you I think we did a much better job the</text>
  <text start="350.05" dur="5.22">question though is how do we prepare</text>
  <text start="352.21" dur="4.47">ourselves for 2020 how do we make sure</text>
  <text start="355.27" dur="4.35">that we&amp;#39;re fully organized</text>
  <text start="356.68" dur="6.15">what is the icees role in fighting this</text>
  <text start="359.62" dur="5.97">disinformation threat and how can we</text>
  <text start="362.83" dur="6">build upon public/private partnerships</text>
  <text start="365.59" dur="6.18">with online social media companies in a</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="5.19">way that works for both sides this is a</text>
  <text start="371.77" dur="4.35">problem as the Chairman&amp;#39;s mentioned with</text>
  <text start="374.02" dur="4.649">the question around deep fakes and other</text>
  <text start="376.12" dur="6.06">areas that technology is only to make</text>
  <text start="378.669" dur="6.271">more difficult the second issue I&amp;#39;d hope</text>
  <text start="382.18" dur="4.38">to you at all dress today is the threat</text>
  <text start="384.94" dur="3.81">from China particularly in the fields of</text>
  <text start="386.56" dur="3.539">technology I think we all saw the</text>
  <text start="388.75" dur="3.96">Justice Department announcement</text>
  <text start="390.099" dur="3.87">yesterday about wall way I have to say</text>
  <text start="392.71" dur="4.41">is a former entrepreneur and venture</text>
  <text start="393.969" dur="5.761">capitalist I long held the view that</text>
  <text start="397.12" dur="4.26">economically advanced China would</text>
  <text start="399.73" dur="3.9">eventually become a responsible global</text>
  <text start="401.38" dur="4.62">citizen that would join the world trade</text>
  <text start="403.63" dur="5.31">agreement organization and whose system</text>
  <text start="406" dur="6.06">would ultimately be liberalized by</text>
  <text start="408.94" dur="5.039">market-based economies unfortunately</text>
  <text start="412.06" dur="4.77">what we&amp;#39;ve seen particularly in the last</text>
  <text start="413.979" dur="5.071">two or three years is the opposite with</text>
  <text start="416.83" dur="4.71">the consolidation of power by the</text>
  <text start="419.05" dur="5.97">Communist Chinese party and with</text>
  <text start="421.54" dur="5.659">President Xi emphasizing nationalistic</text>
  <text start="425.02" dur="4.5">tendencies and an aggressive posture</text>
  <text start="427.199" dur="5.44">towards those nations on China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="6.3">periphery and an economic policy that</text>
  <text start="432.639" dur="5.211">seeks by hook or by crook to catch up</text>
  <text start="435.82" dur="5.25">and to surpass the United States</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="5.89">economically especially in the areas of</text>
  <text start="441.07" dur="6.77">technology like AI machine learning</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="7.17">biotech 5g and other related areas</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="5.23">especially concerning have been the</text>
  <text start="450.91" dur="4.2">efforts of big Chinese tech companies</text>
  <text start="453.07" dur="4.5">which will beholden to the Communist</text>
  <text start="455.11" dur="6.059">Chinese party to acquire sensitive</text>

  <text start="1904.08" dur="4.98">we have about protecting data from</text>
  <text start="1906.96" dur="3.93">foreign adversaries I&amp;#39;ll probably turn</text>
  <text start="1909.06" dur="5.79">to director ray and the gentleman Tony</text>
  <text start="1910.89" dur="7.77">on this again well I think it&amp;#39;s a great</text>
  <text start="1914.85" dur="9">concern certainly we see strong interest</text>
  <text start="1918.66" dur="7.02">from a computer intrusion dimension both</text>
  <text start="1923.85" dur="4.17">from nation-states but also from</text>
  <text start="1925.68" dur="4.41">criminal hackers and increasingly the</text>
  <text start="1928.02" dur="4.59">two in a blended threat way so we see</text>
  <text start="1930.09" dur="5.31">nation-states enlisting the help of</text>
  <text start="1932.61" dur="4.86">criminal hackers which just is a form of</text>
  <text start="1935.4" dur="4.35">outsourcing that makes it even more of a</text>
  <text start="1937.47" dur="3.81">menace so it&amp;#39;s something that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1939.75" dur="5.25">extremely focused on and should be a</text>
  <text start="1941.28" dur="6.3">high priority general mr. chairman I</text>
  <text start="1945" dur="4.83">concur with with the importance of data</text>
  <text start="1947.58" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the coin of the realm today if</text>
  <text start="1949.83" dur="5.85">you think the power of data not only for</text>
  <text start="1952.56" dur="4.59">information that it can provide us but</text>
  <text start="1955.68" dur="4.35">also as you indicated the weaponization</text>
  <text start="1957.15" dur="5.01">of it we see our adversaries very</text>
  <text start="1960.03" dur="5.37">interested in being able to procure data</text>
  <text start="1962.16" dur="4.5">and obviously as director ray mentioned</text>
  <text start="1965.4" dur="2.52">this is something that we&amp;#39;re very very</text>
  <text start="1966.66" dur="3">focused on as well as the National</text>

  <text start="1974.7" dur="8.76">today well certain certainly China has</text>
  <text start="1981.06" dur="5.31">the capacity and the resources to be</text>
  <text start="1983.46" dur="5.1">able to do a lot but that has not</text>
  <text start="1986.37" dur="5.04">deterred other major nations like Russia</text>

  <text start="1991.41" dur="4.89">this you have identified this as a</text>
  <text start="1993.8" dur="4.87">significant threat we are awash in data</text>
  <text start="1996.3" dur="4.71">we have to understand how our</text>

  <text start="2011.12" dur="4.86">influence efforts are being thrown at</text>
  <text start="2013.49" dur="5.25">the United States set so that is why we</text>
  <text start="2015.98" dur="4.14">are as a whole is a very very high</text>
  <text start="2018.74" dur="4.14">priority as you mentioned in your</text>
  <text start="2020.12" dur="5.43">opening statement in terms of how we</text>
  <text start="2022.88" dur="4.68">resource our community intelligence</text>
  <text start="2025.55" dur="4.79">community with the kind of tools and</text>
  <text start="2027.56" dur="5.7">weapons needed to address this issue</text>
  <text start="2030.34" dur="5.2">director I was just going to add that as</text>
  <text start="2033.26" dur="6.09">the challenges of encryption become</text>
  <text start="2035.54" dur="6.9">bigger and bigger on the SIGINT side</text>
  <text start="2039.35" dur="5.61">were more and more dependent on human</text>
  <text start="2042.44" dur="4.8">sources and the more a big data can be</text>
  <text start="2044.96" dur="5.16">exploited by our adversaries the harder</text>
  <text start="2047.24" dur="5.13">it is to recruit and retain human source</text>
  <text start="2050.12" dur="5">system suspect director hospital may</text>
  <text start="2052.37" dur="7.17">have a view on that as well</text>
  <text start="2055.12" dur="6.85">I think director director ray captured</text>
  <text start="2059.54" dur="6.359">that exactly and I would just add from</text>
  <text start="2061.97" dur="7.199">the CIA perspective that a big focus for</text>
  <text start="2065.899" dur="5.49">us is finding out how our adversaries</text>
  <text start="2069.169" dur="5.181">are using big data against us and</text>
  <text start="2071.389" dur="5.461">sharing that with our partners I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="2074.35" dur="3.97">exercise the chair for just a second for</text>
  <text start="2076.85" dur="6.63">one last question and this is your</text>
  <text start="2078.32" dur="6.96">opportunity to recruit your agencies to</text>
  <text start="2083.48" dur="4.5">do cutting-edge research on every</text>
  <text start="2085.28" dur="5.79">technology you could imagine from</text>
  <text start="2087.98" dur="5.159">classic spy craft like disguising to</text>
  <text start="2091.07" dur="6.03">communications technology that would</text>
  <text start="2093.139" dur="6.331">blow James Bond and Q branch away what</text>
  <text start="2097.1" dur="6.17">pitch would you make to those in school</text>
  <text start="2099.47" dur="6.84">now or perhaps those working in tech and</text>
  <text start="2103.27" dur="5.5">looking to serve a greater purpose that</text>
  <text start="2106.31" dur="5.28">they should come apply their engineering</text>
  <text start="2108.77" dur="7.32">degrees coding skills and creativity and</text>
  <text start="2111.59" dur="6.39">work in the icy records I would say</text>
  <text start="2116.09" dur="5.31">there is nothing more rewarding than</text>
  <text start="2117.98" dur="5.64">protecting the American people and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2121.4" dur="3.96">seen with some of our smartest high-tech</text>
  <text start="2123.62" dur="3.36">folks I can think of one office in</text>

  <text start="2126.98" dur="5.19">of our brightest stars with great talent</text>
  <text start="2129.859" dur="3.961">briefly left for what they thought would</text>
  <text start="2132.17" dur="3.75">be greener pastures in the private</text>
  <text start="2133.82" dur="4.77">sector and I was very pleased to see</text>
  <text start="2135.92" dur="4.02">them both independently come back only</text>
  <text start="2138.59" dur="5.01">about eight months later when they</text>
  <text start="2139.94" dur="5.1">realized the grass was browner if I</text>
  <text start="2143.6" dur="4.68">could mr. chairman I would have probably</text>
  <text start="2145.04" dur="5.94">asked you for a to release the tape of</text>
  <text start="2148.28" dur="5.1">what you just said in terms of really</text>
  <text start="2150.98" dur="4.56">how innovative and how creative and the</text>
  <text start="2153.38" dur="3.95">opportunities that the folks in the I</text>
  <text start="2155.54" dur="4.14">see didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to engage in</text>
  <text start="2157.33" dur="4.51">farce trip anything that you see in a</text>
  <text start="2159.68" dur="3.6">Hollywood movie and the other thing I</text>
  <text start="2161.84" dur="3.81">would add to that is imagine when you</text>
  <text start="2163.28" dur="4.41">get up every morning that your task your</text>
  <text start="2165.65" dur="4.74">responsibility is to defend the hopes</text>
  <text start="2167.69" dur="4.23">and dreams of 320 million Americans and</text>
  <text start="2170.39" dur="2.79">that&amp;#39;s something that we relish the</text>
  <text start="2171.92" dur="4.13">opportunity to do that every single day</text>
  <text start="2173.18" dur="6.09">and people would want to join that team</text>
  <text start="2176.05" dur="4.54">mr. chairman our mission sells itself</text>
  <text start="2179.27" dur="3.48">when we talk to our people</text>
  <text start="2180.59" dur="4.11">I would offer as as we talk to young</text>
  <text start="2182.75" dur="4.8">people at the National Security Agency I</text>
  <text start="2184.7" dur="4.409">saw a big data artificial intelligence</text>
  <text start="2187.55" dur="4.2">machine learning cloud computing in</text>
  <text start="2189.109" dur="4.531">places like Baghdad and Kabul in support</text>
  <text start="2191.75" dur="4.83">of our forces long before we ever called</text>
  <text start="2193.64" dur="5.46">it that that&amp;#39;s the selling point that we</text>
  <text start="2196.58" dur="4.02">emphasize to our people because if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2199.1" dur="4.41">cutting edge we will be doing at the</text>
  <text start="2200.6" dur="5.82">National Security Agency Robert mr.</text>
  <text start="2203.51" dur="4.68">chairman we&amp;#39;re proud of the bill our</text>
  <text start="2206.42" dur="4.74">ability to recruit some of the talent</text>
  <text start="2208.19" dur="5.88">you just described we don&amp;#39;t do it often</text>
  <text start="2211.16" dur="4.949">on fiscal terms we do it on psychic</text>
  <text start="2214.07" dur="5.549">terms and so serving something greater</text>
  <text start="2216.109" dur="5.971">than oneself for a cause to protect the</text>
  <text start="2219.619" dur="4.681">nation and our interests is one that</text>
  <text start="2222.08" dur="3.66">both the tracks and retains the</text>
  <text start="2224.3" dur="4.29">lifeblood of our agency which is our</text>
  <text start="2225.74" dur="4.98">people director Haskell you want to take</text>
  <text start="2228.59" dur="5.85">a shot at selling something that not</text>
  <text start="2230.72" dur="6.81">many people know about well like my</text>
  <text start="2234.44" dur="4.919">colleague CIA officers come to Langley</text>
  <text start="2237.53" dur="4.05">for the mission and they stay because of</text>
  <text start="2239.359" dur="4.051">the mission and it&amp;#39;s really about being</text>
  <text start="2241.58" dur="4.23">something part of something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2243.41" dur="4.59">bigger than yourself and in terms of</text>
  <text start="2245.81" dur="3.48">advanced technologies it&amp;#39;s a chance to</text>
  <text start="2248" dur="4.02">be on the cutting edge and make a</text>
  <text start="2249.29" dur="5.88">difference let me just conclude by</text>
  <text start="2252.02" dur="4.92">saying the disciplines that come out of</text>
  <text start="2255.17" dur="4.17">higher education and</text>
  <text start="2256.94" dur="5.22">and community colleges today all of</text>
  <text start="2259.34" dur="5.25">those disciplines are applicable to the</text>
  <text start="2262.16" dur="4.65">agencies that sit before us today and</text>
  <text start="2264.59" dur="4.86">there should be no student that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2266.81" dur="4.05">look at this as a way to apply what</text>
  <text start="2269.45" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ve learned or the degree that they</text>
  <text start="2270.86" dur="4.29">have that didn&amp;#39;t used to be the case it</text>
  <text start="2273.5" dur="2.94">was all specialized but now it applies</text>
  <text start="2275.15" dur="2.94">to everything directly well miss</text>
  <text start="2276.44" dur="4.23">chairman is as somewhat of an older</text>
  <text start="2278.09" dur="6.27">generation here who has to turn to his</text>
  <text start="2280.67" dur="7.68">grandson to get the TV on the right</text>
  <text start="2284.36" dur="6.51">channel I&amp;#39;m continually amazed as I get</text>
  <text start="2288.35" dur="5.25">around the country talking to colleges</text>
  <text start="2290.87" dur="5.7">and graduates and people that are in</text>
  <text start="2293.6" dur="7.08">these stem positions and studying of</text>
  <text start="2296.57" dur="8.67">their incredible talent they bring those</text>
  <text start="2300.68" dur="7.55">kind of talents and skills to our</text>
  <text start="2305.24" dur="5.64">agencies as you have heard and it is</text>
  <text start="2308.23" dur="4.42">extremely rewarding to see the young</text>
  <text start="2310.88" dur="4.2">people who know they could have a better</text>
  <text start="2312.65" dur="6.63">financial deal or settled lifestyle</text>
  <text start="2315.08" dur="8.4">easier and so forth and so on they want</text>
  <text start="2319.28" dur="6.84">to serve this country and they see this</text>
  <text start="2323.48" dur="5.31">as meaningful and it exceeds what</text>
  <text start="2326.12" dur="5.49">financial gains they could get on the</text>
  <text start="2328.79" dur="5.46">outside and plus they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re able to</text>
  <text start="2331.61" dur="4.08">do some really cool stuff in all of</text>
  <text start="2334.25" dur="3.99">these agencies which we can&amp;#39;t talk about</text>
  <text start="2335.69" dur="4.65">here but it is it is attractive to it</text>
  <text start="2338.24" dur="4.95">but their commitment to the country and</text>
  <text start="2340.34" dur="5.76">commitment to the mission as has been</text>
  <text start="2343.19" dur="4.56">demonstrated here is pretty as awfully</text>
  <text start="2346.1" dur="3.9">rewarding when you go out and see what</text>
  <text start="2347.75" dur="4.17">these young people have and what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2350" dur="4.35">willing to do for the country I thank</text>
  <text start="2351.92" dur="7.89">all of you vice chairman well thank you</text>
  <text start="2354.35" dur="8.67">mr. chairman and I agree that the people</text>
  <text start="2359.81" dur="5.79">who work with all of you are</text>
  <text start="2363.02" dur="6.5">extraordinarily special Americans and</text>
  <text start="2365.6" dur="9.03">the mission is critically important I</text>
  <text start="2369.52" dur="6.16">would personally add one other item that</text>
  <text start="2374.63" dur="2.24">they work for the United States</text>
  <text start="2375.68" dur="3.62">government</text>
  <text start="2376.87" dur="7.86">they actually ought to be paid on time</text>
  <text start="2379.3" dur="9.16">and I question I&amp;#39;ve seen the number of</text>
  <text start="2384.73" dur="5.47">federal employees who&amp;#39;ve gone five weeks</text>
  <text start="2388.46" dur="3.329">plus without pay</text>
  <text start="2390.2" dur="4.069">I&amp;#39;m not sure many folks in the private</text>
  <text start="2391.789" dur="5.76">sector would show up five weeks plus</text>
  <text start="2394.269" dur="6.1">without pay on an ongoing basis and</text>
  <text start="2397.549" dur="5.52">while I&amp;#39;m appreciate of the fact that</text>
  <text start="2400.369" dur="5.791">particularly the FBI that your agents</text>
  <text start="2403.069" dur="5.901">will be reimbursed I do worry the FBI</text>
  <text start="2406.16" dur="5.85">has a number of contractors under our</text>
  <text start="2408.97" dur="6.549">current setting they will come out of</text>
  <text start="2412.01" dur="7.41">this five week plus 35 days shutdown</text>
  <text start="2415.519" dur="6.33">with nothing to show and if we cannot</text>
  <text start="2419.42" dur="4.949">guarantee that people that work for</text>
  <text start="2421.849" dur="7.02">United States government are going to be</text>
  <text start="2424.369" dur="6.121">not used as hostages for either side of</text>
  <text start="2428.869" dur="3.24">the political debate then I think our</text>
  <text start="2430.49" dur="4.23">ability to recruit and retain it go down</text>
  <text start="2432.109" dur="3.841">dramatically I don&amp;#39;t know director ray</text>
  <text start="2434.72" dur="3.869">if you want to make any comment on that</text>
  <text start="2435.95" dur="5.339">or maybe just punt but it is something</text>
  <text start="2438.589" dur="5.101">I&amp;#39;ve I saw FBI agents I saw homeland</text>
  <text start="2441.289" dur="4.141">security agents I saw air traffic</text>
  <text start="2443.69" dur="4.349">controllers working double shifts and</text>
  <text start="2445.43" dur="3.659">then going and driving an uber I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2448.039" dur="3.81">sure I want somebody showing up</text>
  <text start="2449.089" dur="8.361">maintaining the safety of our of our</text>
  <text start="2451.849" dur="9.27">Airways with the four hours of sleep Oh</text>
  <text start="2457.45" dur="6.01">mr. vice chairman needless to say we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2461.119" dur="5.16">still assessing the overall operational</text>
  <text start="2463.46" dur="4.589">impact of the shutdown but what&amp;#39;s quite</text>
  <text start="2466.279" dur="5.31">clear is that it was incredibly negative</text>
  <text start="2468.049" dur="6.3">and painful for the 37,000 men and women</text>
  <text start="2471.589" dur="4.831">of the FBI and their families but I will</text>
  <text start="2474.349" dur="4.281">also say that I could not be more proud</text>
  <text start="2476.42" dur="5.49">of their professionalism and their</text>
  <text start="2478.63" dur="6.01">dedication to not let balls drop but to</text>
  <text start="2481.91" dur="4.82">keep charging ahead across all of our</text>
  <text start="2484.64" dur="3.479">various program areas during that time</text>
  <text start="2486.73" dur="3.67">certainly when you talk about</text>
  <text start="2488.119" dur="4.771">contractors we are very dependent just</text>
  <text start="2490.4" dur="4.08">like every government agency on</text>
  <text start="2492.89" dur="5.129">contractors for a whole range of</text>
  <text start="2494.48" dur="5.22">services and you know we would want to</text>
  <text start="2498.019" dur="4.411">make sure that that aspect of our</text>
  <text start="2499.7" dur="4.829">operations doesn&amp;#39;t get disrupted and my</text>
  <text start="2502.43" dur="5.49">hope would be that folks on both sides</text>
  <text start="2504.529" dur="5.52">the aisle will look at how we might make</text>
  <text start="2507.92" dur="3.78">sure pretty soon those low-price</text>
  <text start="2510.049" dur="3.201">contractors oftentimes the folks who</text>
  <text start="2511.7" dur="4.02">clean the bathrooms or serve the food</text>
  <text start="2513.25" dur="4.869">don&amp;#39;t have to come out of this 35 days</text>
  <text start="2515.72" dur="6.059">shutdown with absolutely no compensation</text>

  <text start="2521.779" dur="3.951">director ranger after coach</text>
  <text start="2523.09" dur="5.04">and this is the Chairman&amp;#39;s alluded to it</text>
  <text start="2525.73" dur="4.23">we&amp;#39;ve all talked about it this emerging</text>
  <text start="2528.13" dur="4.86">challenge around social media</text>
  <text start="2529.96" dur="5.55">particularly the fact whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2532.99" dur="6.39">Russians or other foreign entities that</text>
  <text start="2535.51" dur="6.99">try to masquerade as Americans they</text>
  <text start="2539.38" dur="5.1">build large followings create fake</text>
  <text start="2542.5" dur="3.66">accounts I think this problem isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2544.48" dur="5.73">going to get exponentially harder as we</text>
  <text start="2546.16" dur="7.26">move into deep fake technology a lot of</text>
  <text start="2550.21" dur="4.74">policy implications how do we sort</text>
  <text start="2553.42" dur="5.21">through that how do we work with our</text>
  <text start="2554.95" dur="8.19">social media company partners to put</text>
  <text start="2558.63" dur="8.32">Americans on alert about the the volume</text>
  <text start="2563.14" dur="6.69">of foreign based activities BOTS and</text>
  <text start="2566.95" dur="5.67">others who are masquerading as Americans</text>
  <text start="2569.83" dur="5.19">going forward so they are not able to</text>
  <text start="2572.62" dur="4.47">further manipulate not just our election</text>
  <text start="2575.02" dur="5.58">process but actually do build social</text>
  <text start="2577.09" dur="6.63">divisions well mr. vice chairman this is</text>
  <text start="2580.6" dur="6.29">a particularly vexing and challenging</text>
  <text start="2583.72" dur="6.03">problem I think it&amp;#39;s going to require a</text>
  <text start="2586.89" dur="5.08">holistic response certainly at the FBI</text>
  <text start="2589.75" dur="5.85">through the foreign influence task force</text>
  <text start="2591.97" dur="6.69">and all of our field offices we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2595.6" dur="4.65">trying to work much more closely not</text>
  <text start="2598.66" dur="4.95">just with our intelligence community</text>
  <text start="2600.25" dur="6.6">partners especially general Nakasone II</text>
  <text start="2603.61" dur="5.34">and the NSA but also as you say with the</text>
  <text start="2606.85" dur="5.94">private sector and I will say that one</text>
  <text start="2608.95" dur="6.9">of the bright spots between 2016 and</text>
  <text start="2612.79" dur="4.86">2018 is how much more cooperatively</text>
  <text start="2615.85" dur="4.26">we&amp;#39;re working with the social media</text>
  <text start="2617.65" dur="4.71">companies because there&amp;#39;s an awful lot</text>
  <text start="2620.11" dur="3.78">that really has to be done by them in</text>
  <text start="2622.36" dur="4.32">this space and there were a number of</text>
  <text start="2623.89" dur="5.31">success stories only some of which we</text>
  <text start="2626.68" dur="5.01">could really ever share where the social</text>
  <text start="2629.2" dur="5.43">media companies based on tips that we</text>
  <text start="2631.69" dur="6">provided we&amp;#39;re able to take action much</text>
  <text start="2634.63" dur="5.82">more effectively much more quickly to</text>

  <text start="2640.45" dur="4.05">information warfare that the Russians</text>
  <text start="2642.49" dur="3.69">were engaged in and I think we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2644.5" dur="4.2">to need to see more and more of that but</text>
  <text start="2646.18" dur="3.99">now that we&amp;#39;ve got some momentum we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2648.7" dur="4.26">looking forward to growing that</text>
  <text start="2650.17" dur="4.59">partnership and I think you would agree</text>
  <text start="2652.96" dur="3.81">some companies have</text>
  <text start="2654.76" dur="3.78">done well some have not done as well I</text>
  <text start="2656.77" dur="5.01">think we&amp;#39;re gonna need to continue to</text>
  <text start="2658.54" dur="5.46">explore this and and just basic notional</text>

  <text start="2793.089" dur="2.52">with we&amp;#39;re certainly only going to</text>
  <text start="2794.349" dur="3.211">scratch the surface here today but I</text>
  <text start="2795.609" dur="4.801">want to I want to focus on something</text>
  <text start="2797.56" dur="5.4">that doesn&amp;#39;t get as much focus as I</text>
  <text start="2800.41" dur="4.709">think it should we we seen these days</text>
  <text start="2802.96" dur="3.84">every time we pick up media or turn on</text>
  <text start="2805.119" dur="5.46">TV they&amp;#39;re talking about Russia and</text>

  <text start="2810.579" dur="5.311">things in the world and certainly it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2812.89" dur="5.689">concern but in my judgment and I think</text>
  <text start="2815.89" dur="5.1">many others the real concerns China</text>
  <text start="2818.579" dur="4.931">we&amp;#39;re approaching the end of the first</text>
  <text start="2820.99" dur="7.02">fifth of the 21st century and if we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2823.51" dur="8.309">learned anything it&amp;#39;s the the last few</text>
  <text start="2828.01" dur="5.67">decades have convinced us that China in</text>
  <text start="2831.819" dur="4.681">the 21st century as we proceed through</text>
  <text start="2833.68" dur="5.24">it is going to be a major competitor of</text>
  <text start="2836.5" dur="6.14">ours in in every way that there is</text>
  <text start="2838.92" dur="6.36">obviously economically militarily</text>
  <text start="2842.64" dur="6.37">culturally and in every other way and</text>
  <text start="2845.28" dur="5.53">look this is going to happen we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2849.01" dur="3.839">living in the 21st century that</text>
  <text start="2850.81" dur="3.87">communications and transportation are so</text>
  <text start="2852.849" dur="3.031">different than what they were and we as</text>
  <text start="2854.68" dur="2.7">the United States are going to wind up</text>
  <text start="2855.88" dur="6.03">having to compete like we never have</text>
  <text start="2857.38" dur="6.57">before with a gorilla that&amp;#39;s starting to</text>
  <text start="2861.91" dur="5.01">get to be about the same size we are and</text>
  <text start="2863.95" dur="5.61">as a result of that we&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="2866.92" dur="4.83">learn to deal with that the thing I</text>
  <text start="2869.56" dur="4.769">really want to focus on is how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2871.75" dur="5.13">going to deal with that we were</text>
  <text start="2874.329" dur="4.681">Americans we&amp;#39;ve always competed we can</text>
  <text start="2876.88" dur="4.62">compete we innovate we create we</text>
  <text start="2879.01" dur="6">manufacture we do the great things we do</text>
  <text start="2881.5" dur="5.28">that have really led the world but we</text>
  <text start="2885.01" dur="5.13">can only do it if we&amp;#39;re operating under</text>
  <text start="2886.78" dur="5.25">a rule of law and and that is something</text>
  <text start="2890.14" dur="4.85">that is greatly missing at the present</text>
  <text start="2892.03" dur="6.059">time as China tries to compete with us</text>
  <text start="2894.99" dur="4.51">the poster child for me is a local</text>
  <text start="2898.089" dur="3.631">company we have an Idaho micron</text>
  <text start="2899.5" dur="6.03">technology most you&amp;#39;ve heard of them the</text>
  <text start="2901.72" dur="6.629">second largest manufacturer of memory</text>
  <text start="2905.53" dur="6.15">and in the world and they have had a</text>
  <text start="2908.349" dur="6.631">recent case where Chinese nationals</text>
  <text start="2911.68" dur="5.55">stoled intellectual property and</text>

  <text start="2927.43" dur="4.34">can&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2929.109" dur="5.46">I had a spirited discussion with the</text>
  <text start="2931.77" dur="5.579">Chinese ambassador about this as he</text>
  <text start="2934.569" dur="7.621">attempted to defend the undefendable and</text>
  <text start="2937.349" dur="6.49">his suggestion was that well things</text>
  <text start="2942.19" dur="4.56">aren&amp;#39;t as advanced in China as they are</text>
  <text start="2943.839" dur="6.121">here well I get that they are they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2946.75" dur="6.21">come a long long long ways in in a few</text>
  <text start="2949.96" dur="5.85">decades but if we&amp;#39;re gonna if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2952.96" dur="7.139">gonna do this and keep the world order</text>
  <text start="2955.81" dur="6.539">in right side up China is going to have</text>
  <text start="2960.099" dur="3.931">to develop their rule of law and live by</text>
  <text start="2962.349" dur="3.831">it much better than what they have</text>
  <text start="2964.03" dur="5.49">recently we just saw again the the</text>
  <text start="2966.18" dur="6.429">indictments against the Huawei official</text>

  <text start="2979.329" dur="4.53">the question I have for you is after</text>
  <text start="2981.79" dur="5.52">listening to the Chinese ambassador</text>
  <text start="2983.859" dur="5.671">I&amp;#39;m not wholly convinced that their</text>

  <text start="2991.78" dur="3.27">up when it comes to the rule of law and</text>
  <text start="2993.819" dur="4.441">what I&amp;#39;m talking about the rule of law I</text>
  <text start="2995.05" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t mean just covert theft but I mean</text>
  <text start="2998.26" dur="4.95">the what I call over theft and that is</text>
  <text start="3000.96" dur="5.28">where they require businesses as we all</text>
  <text start="3003.21" dur="5.07">know to divulge their information before</text>
  <text start="3006.24" dur="3.42">they can do business in China and then</text>
  <text start="3008.28" dur="3.23">having the kind of restrictions they</text>
  <text start="3009.66" dur="4.56">have on them in China and all of this</text>
  <text start="3011.51" dur="4.839">causes us real difficulty as we as we</text>
  <text start="3014.22" dur="3.72">attempt to compete director Coates I</text>

  <text start="3126.42" dur="7.349">can talk about that we have alerted our</text>
  <text start="3130.109" dur="6.871">allies they are now second-guessing in</text>
  <text start="3133.769" dur="4.83">questioning their initial responses to</text>
  <text start="3136.98" dur="4.349">China oh it&amp;#39;s a great market we need to</text>
  <text start="3138.599" dur="5.16">get over there don&amp;#39;t worry about</text>
  <text start="3141.329" dur="4.41">anything else except selling our product</text>
  <text start="3143.759" dur="5.431">they&amp;#39;re now finding that their product</text>
  <text start="3145.739" dur="4.83">has been duplicated by the Chinese and</text>
  <text start="3149.19" dur="3.599">sold for half the price because then</text>
  <text start="3150.569" dur="6.99">have to spend as much money on research</text>
  <text start="3152.789" dur="6.691">and development so it is we are working</text>
  <text start="3157.559" dur="4.321">with the Chairman the vice chairman and</text>
  <text start="3159.48" dur="4.379">with the committee actually to try to be</text>
  <text start="3161.88" dur="5.82">as transparent as possible with our</text>
  <text start="3163.859" dur="5.75">company heads we&amp;#39;ve been traveling</text>
  <text start="3167.7" dur="6.299">around the United States meeting with</text>
  <text start="3169.609" dur="8.74">CEOs and others we&amp;#39;re dialing up a</text>
  <text start="3173.999" dur="6.03">program with the I think I ought to stop</text>
  <text start="3178.349" dur="4.011">right there and and the rest of this</text>
  <text start="3180.029" dur="4.851">ought to go into a secure</text>
  <text start="3182.36" dur="4.32">setting in terms of how we&amp;#39;re dealing</text>
  <text start="3184.88" dur="4.68">with this but I&amp;#39;d love to turn to</text>
  <text start="3186.68" dur="7.02">director ray relative to what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3189.56" dur="7.47">doing senator I completely share your</text>
  <text start="3193.7" dur="4.83">observations and I would just say that</text>
  <text start="3197.03" dur="3.78">one of the things that the American</text>
  <text start="3198.53" dur="4.44">people I think are now sort of waking up</text>
  <text start="3200.81" dur="4.74">to understand is that the Chinese</text>
  <text start="3202.97" dur="4.41">government the lines between the Chinese</text>
  <text start="3205.55" dur="3.72">government the Chinese Communist Party</text>
  <text start="3207.38" dur="3.66">are blurred if not totally erased the</text>
  <text start="3209.27" dur="4.5">lines between the Chinese government and</text>
  <text start="3211.04" dur="5.04">Chinese state-owned enterprises the same</text>
  <text start="3213.77" dur="4.38">the giant line between the Chinese</text>
  <text start="3216.08" dur="3.93">government and ostensibly private</text>
  <text start="3218.15" dur="3.57">companies for all the reasons you</text>
  <text start="3220.01" dur="4.53">described and especially the line</text>
  <text start="3221.72" dur="5.49">between lawful behavior and fair</text>
  <text start="3224.54" dur="5.37">competition and lying and hacking and</text>
  <text start="3227.21" dur="4.14">cheating and stealing and one of the</text>
  <text start="3229.91" dur="4.44">things that I&amp;#39;ve been most encouraged</text>
  <text start="3231.35" dur="5.19">about in an otherwise bleak landscape is</text>
  <text start="3234.35" dur="5.16">the degree to which as director Coates</text>
  <text start="3236.54" dur="5.16">was alluding to American companies are</text>
  <text start="3239.51" dur="5.04">waking up American universities are</text>
  <text start="3241.7" dur="5.94">waking up our foreign partners are</text>
  <text start="3244.55" dur="5.13">waking up and it&amp;#39;s one of the few issues</text>
  <text start="3247.64" dur="6.3">that I find when I engage in the</text>
  <text start="3249.68" dur="5.76">interagency and up on the hill covering</text>
  <text start="3253.94" dur="3.51">from one end of the spectrum to the</text>
  <text start="3255.44" dur="5.01">other there seems to be actually more</text>
  <text start="3257.45" dur="4.53">consensus than I&amp;#39;ve ever seen before in</text>
  <text start="3260.45" dur="4.41">my career and I think that&amp;#39;s a positive</text>
  <text start="3261.98" dur="7.41">and we need to build on that do either</text>
  <text start="3264.86" dur="7.53">the generals have yes sir sir you laid</text>
  <text start="3269.39" dur="4.53">out the problem set very well and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3272.39" dur="3.72">been highlighted this isn&amp;#39;t just a u.s.</text>
  <text start="3273.92" dur="3.63">issue this is a global issue when you</text>
  <text start="3276.11" dur="2.97">think about the Internet of Things when</text>
  <text start="3277.55" dur="4.89">you think about the nature of global</text>
  <text start="3279.08" dur="7.08">business and how corporations are</text>
  <text start="3282.44" dur="5.64">integrated and if it touches a company</text>
  <text start="3286.16" dur="3.72">in Australia who may have a relationship</text>
  <text start="3288.08" dur="3.96">with a company in the u.s. then we</text>
  <text start="3289.88" dur="3.45">become connected from a military</text>
  <text start="3292.04" dur="3">standpoint when you look at major</text>
  <text start="3293.33" dur="4.05">acquisition from the Defense</text>
  <text start="3295.04" dur="4.38">Intelligence Agency one of the things we</text>
  <text start="3297.38" dur="4.41">put against this is supply chain risk</text>
  <text start="3299.42" dur="4.47">management threat analysis Center so</text>
  <text start="3301.79" dur="4.65">what do D looks for major acquisition we</text>
  <text start="3303.89" dur="5.31">do the due diligence and research again</text>
  <text start="3306.44" dur="4.11">those against those companies but that</text>
  <text start="3309.2" dur="2.94">challenge is getting more and more</text>
  <text start="3310.55" dur="3.54">complicated because you think you they</text>
  <text start="3312.14" dur="3.15">either buy it they steal it or they can</text>
  <text start="3314.09" dur="2.61">build it</text>
  <text start="3315.29" dur="2.94">but the nature of that business you have</text>
  <text start="3316.7" dur="3.42">things like white labeling where you</text>
  <text start="3318.23" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t necessarily have to disclose the</text>
  <text start="3320.12" dur="4.68">relationship or you could sell a</text>
  <text start="3322.4" dur="5.01">semiconductor a chip a piece of software</text>
  <text start="3324.8" dur="3.84">and ostensibly it is from your company</text>
  <text start="3327.41" dur="3.63">when in fact it may have been</text>
  <text start="3328.64" dur="4.02">manufactured by a Chinese company so</text>
  <text start="3331.04" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s the due diligence that we have to</text>
  <text start="3332.66" dur="5.31">apply to look at the supply chain across</text>
  <text start="3335.15" dur="4.14">all acquisition and we got to bring all</text>
  <text start="3337.97" dur="3.03">our partners in and illuminate the</text>
  <text start="3339.29" dur="3.15">challenge and make sure they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="3341" dur="3.18">the same due diligence whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3342.44" dur="5.87">through sophia&amp;#39;s or other other</text>
  <text start="3344.18" dur="7.32">protocols sooner</text>
  <text start="3348.31" dur="5.92">thank you chairman director coats in</text>
  <text start="3351.5" dur="5.61">this hearing last year you testified</text>
  <text start="3354.23" dur="5.22">that you would recommend minimal access</text>
  <text start="3357.11" dur="4.38">to classified documents to anyone</text>
  <text start="3359.45" dur="4.41">without a permanent security clearance</text>
  <text start="3361.49" dur="5.1">you made that statement with regard to</text>
  <text start="3363.86" dur="4.47">reports of multiple holders of interim</text>
  <text start="3366.59" dur="4.65">security clearances in the white house</text>
  <text start="3368.33" dur="4.89">and now we are seeing published reports</text>
  <text start="3371.24" dur="5.16">that dozens of times the White House has</text>
  <text start="3373.22" dur="5.58">overruled the career FBI experts</text>
  <text start="3376.4" dur="4.5">responsible for adjudicating security</text>
  <text start="3378.8" dur="3.87">clearances granting top-secret</text>
  <text start="3380.9" dur="4.53">clearances to White House officials</text>
  <text start="3382.67" dur="4.89">would you still recommend minimal access</text>
  <text start="3385.43" dur="4.38">to classified documents to those White</text>
  <text start="3387.56" dur="4.26">House officials since FBI experts</text>
  <text start="3389.81" dur="8.22">recommended that they not be given those</text>
  <text start="3391.82" dur="8.13">top-secret clearances I do support the</text>
  <text start="3398.03" dur="5.82">providing all the information necessary</text>
  <text start="3399.95" dur="6.21">for not only the White House but for all</text>
  <text start="3403.85" dur="4.14">of our branches relative to providing</text>
  <text start="3406.16" dur="4.71">security clearance they have those a</text>
  <text start="3407.99" dur="5.76">thought authority to do that we issue</text>
  <text start="3410.87" dur="5.7">guidelines in terms of what I understand</text>
  <text start="3413.75" dur="6.27">that already I hear - I want to know do</text>
  <text start="3416.57" dur="6.3">you think that that the White House</text>
  <text start="3420.02" dur="6.15">should take seriously the</text>
  <text start="3422.87" dur="5.46">recommendations of those FBI experts to</text>
  <text start="3426.17" dur="4.95">my knowledge they do take seriously is</text>
  <text start="3428.33" dur="4.35">their decision based on a whole number</text>
  <text start="3431.12" dur="7.11">of factors we&amp;#39;ve seen every</text>
  <text start="3432.68" dur="8.7">administration issue clearances based on</text>
  <text start="3438.23" dur="4.86">how they assess what is provided our job</text>
  <text start="3441.38" dur="5.64">is to provide them the best information</text>
  <text start="3443.09" dur="5.91">we have relative to security clearance</text>
  <text start="3447.02" dur="3.48">processes so that they have the full</text>
  <text start="3449" dur="3.71">in front of them but when they make that</text>
  <text start="3450.5" dur="5.91">decision speaking of the full picture</text>
  <text start="3452.71" dur="5.95">last year we passed the secret act as</text>
  <text start="3456.41" dur="3.96">the Director of National Intelligence do</text>
  <text start="3458.66" dur="4.62">you think it&amp;#39;s problematic that the</text>
  <text start="3460.37" dur="4.86">administration has not complied with the</text>
  <text start="3463.28" dur="4.65">portion of that law requiring the White</text>
  <text start="3465.23" dur="4.05">House to report on its process for</text>
  <text start="3467.93" dur="5.82">conducting security clearance</text>
  <text start="3469.28" dur="6.39">investigations I&amp;#39;m not aware that that</text>
  <text start="3473.75" dur="5.04">has happened I&amp;#39;d be happy to look into</text>
  <text start="3475.67" dur="5.79">that I would appreciate that director</text>
  <text start="3478.79" dur="4.56">ray as I mentioned we&amp;#39;re seeing public</text>
  <text start="3481.46" dur="4.4">published reports that numerous times</text>
  <text start="3483.35" dur="5.67">the White House&amp;#39;s simply overruled</text>
  <text start="3485.86" dur="5.95">career FBI experts responsible for</text>
  <text start="3489.02" dur="4.83">adjudicating those clearances in your</text>
  <text start="3491.81" dur="4.59">view were there valid reasons given for</text>
  <text start="3493.85" dur="6.15">why the FBI&amp;#39;s expert advice was</text>
  <text start="3496.4" dur="5.82">overruled so many times senator I think</text>
  <text start="3500" dur="5.3">there may be some confusion about the</text>
  <text start="3502.22" dur="7.23">way the process actually works</text>
  <text start="3505.3" dur="5.92">the FBI is in the context of providing</text>
  <text start="3509.45" dur="4.74">background investigations for people</text>
  <text start="3511.22" dur="5.1">other than its own employees is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3514.19" dur="4.02">called an isp or the investigative</text>
  <text start="3516.32" dur="4.29">serves provider so we essentially do it</text>
  <text start="3518.21" dur="4.89">at the request of whoever the requesting</text>
  <text start="3520.61" dur="4.32">entity is in this instance it would be</text>
  <text start="3523.1" dur="3.78">the White House and I think where the</text>
  <text start="3524.93" dur="3.72">confusion is is what we do is we</text>
  <text start="3526.88" dur="3.9">assemble the information we provide the</text>
  <text start="3528.65" dur="4.83">factual information we do not actually</text>
  <text start="3530.78" dur="3.99">make recommendations one way or the</text>
  <text start="3533.48" dur="3.81">other or about the clearances the</text>
  <text start="3534.77" dur="5.19">decision about what to do based on those</text>
  <text start="3537.29" dur="5.58">facts is entrusted by long-standing</text>
  <text start="3539.96" dur="4.59">process to the requesting entity so we</text>
  <text start="3542.87" dur="3.89">provide the information but then they</text>
  <text start="3544.55" dur="4.2">make the call thank you director</text>
  <text start="3546.76" dur="4.42">director Coates I want to come back to</text>
  <text start="3548.75" dur="4.89">you for a moment your your office issued</text>
  <text start="3551.18" dur="3.84">a statement recently announcing that you</text>
  <text start="3553.64" dur="3.69">had submitted the intelligence</text>
  <text start="3555.02" dur="5.31">community&amp;#39;s report assessing threats to</text>
  <text start="3557.33" dur="5.37">the 2018 midterm elections to the</text>

  <text start="3562.7" dur="4.8">agencies our committee has not seen this</text>
  <text start="3565.01" dur="4.71">report and despite committee requests</text>
  <text start="3567.5" dur="4.2">following the election that the odni</text>
  <text start="3569.72" dur="2.7">breached the committee on any identified</text>
  <text start="3571.7" dur="4.23">threats</text>
  <text start="3572.42" dur="5.64">it took odni two months for us to get a</text>
  <text start="3575.93" dur="4.89">simple oral briefing and no written</text>
  <text start="3578.06" dur="4.58">assessment has yet to be provided can</text>
  <text start="3580.82" dur="4.669">you explain to me</text>
  <text start="3582.64" dur="4.59">we haven&amp;#39;t been kept more fully and</text>
  <text start="3585.489" dur="4.02">currently informed about those Russian</text>
  <text start="3587.23" dur="4.889">activities in the 28 dose before you</text>
  <text start="3589.509" dur="4.471">respond let me just acknowledge to the</text>
  <text start="3592.119" dur="5.271">members that the vice-chairman and I</text>
  <text start="3593.98" dur="5.849">have both been briefed on the report and</text>
  <text start="3597.39" dur="5.379">it&amp;#39;s my understanding that the report at</text>
  <text start="3599.829" dur="4.74">some point will be available yeah the</text>
  <text start="3602.769" dur="5.941">process that we&amp;#39;re going through or two</text>
  <text start="3604.569" dur="7.381">45 day periods one for the IC to assess</text>
  <text start="3608.71" dur="4.859">whether there was anything that resulted</text>
  <text start="3611.95" dur="4.26">in a change of the vote or tampering</text>
  <text start="3613.569" dur="4.92">with machines what the influenced</text>
  <text start="3616.21" dur="3.75">efforts were and so forth so we we</text>
  <text start="3618.489" dur="4.35">collected all of that and then the</text>
  <text start="3619.96" dur="4.799">second 45 days which we then provided to</text>
  <text start="3622.839" dur="5.371">the chairman and vice-chairman and the</text>
  <text start="3624.759" dur="6.03">second 45 days now is with DHS looking</text>
  <text start="3628.21" dur="6.27">in DOJ looking at whether there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3630.789" dur="5.371">information enough there to take what to</text>
  <text start="3634.48" dur="3.45">determine what kind of response that</text>
  <text start="3636.16" dur="4.8">they might take we&amp;#39;re waiting for that</text>
  <text start="3637.93" dur="5.069">final through the rest of information to</text>
  <text start="3640.96" dur="3.359">come in so that we&amp;#39;ll be reading Gumby</text>
  <text start="3642.999" dur="4.59">restiveness can look forward to reading</text>
  <text start="3644.319" dur="4.891">that report I think we will be informing</text>
  <text start="3647.589" dur="4.141">the chairman and the vice chairman of</text>
  <text start="3649.21" dur="5.099">that yes are there decisions that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3651.73" dur="4.349">what I asked well the rest of the</text>
  <text start="3654.309" dur="5.48">committee have access to that report mr.</text>
  <text start="3656.079" dur="6.091">chairman chairman burr</text>
  <text start="3659.789" dur="4">well let me say the members were sort of</text>
  <text start="3662.17" dur="3.839">in our in Charter ground but I make the</text>
  <text start="3663.789" dur="4.02">same commitment I always do that</text>
  <text start="3666.009" dur="4.26">anything that the vice chairman and and</text>
  <text start="3667.809" dur="4.5">and myself were exposed to will make</text>
  <text start="3670.269" dur="3.54">every request to open the aperture so</text>
  <text start="3672.309" dur="3.091">that all members can see it I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3673.809" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s vitally important especially on</text>
  <text start="3675.4" dur="6.089">this one we&amp;#39;re not to a point where</text>
  <text start="3678.849" dur="5.551">we&amp;#39;ve been denied or we&amp;#39;re not to a</text>
  <text start="3681.489" dur="5.82">point that negotiations need to start so</text>
  <text start="3684.4" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s my hope that once the final 45-day</text>
  <text start="3687.309" dur="4.26">window is up that is a report that will</text>
  <text start="3689.68" dur="4.53">be made it made available probably to</text>
  <text start="3691.569" dur="6.3">members only that would be my hope as</text>
  <text start="3694.21" dur="5.849">well senator Rubio thank you director a</text>
  <text start="3697.869" dur="3.72">but as we keep talking about China and</text>
  <text start="3700.059" dur="4.44">this takes off on what Senator Risch has</text>
  <text start="3701.589" dur="5.51">already asked at the app using the</text>
  <text start="3704.499" dur="5.07">academic community and the universities</text>
  <text start="3707.099" dur="4">commercial espionage the force transfer</text>

  <text start="3712.509" dur="3.8">supply chain</text>
  <text start="3714.21" dur="3.69">obviously the traditional</text>
  <text start="3716.309" dur="3.99">counterintelligence work that they do</text>

  <text start="4026.93" dur="3.569">how to address that obviously is a</text>

  <text start="4100.04" dur="4.02">have a lot of support from a lot of our</text>

  <text start="4115.52" dur="5.7">general Ashley here the influence of the</text>

  <text start="4123.23" dur="6">probably is a key to what direction we</text>
  <text start="4126.92" dur="3.84">might go in so I would say that</text>
  <text start="4129.23" dur="2.85">everything you laid out is correct we</text>
  <text start="4130.76" dur="3.21">expect to see another two million</text>

  <text start="4169.13" dur="3.36">out of China as well but there is</text>
  <text start="4171.02" dur="3.569">relationship there from a military</text>

  <text start="4257.219" dur="5.55">principle on why way it seems to me they</text>

  <text start="4507.4" dur="5.13">my question if in the next two years and</text>

  <text start="4526.66" dur="3.24">concern is it&amp;#39;s one thing for the</text>
  <text start="4528.4" dur="3.93">Intelligence Committee to know that this</text>
  <text start="4529.9" dur="4.44">is happening but if they don&amp;#39;t inform</text>
  <text start="4532.33" dur="5.07">the people who are being victimized who</text>
  <text start="4534.34" dur="5.25">are being attacked in this way I think</text>
  <text start="4537.4" dur="3.54">that really blunts the effectiveness of</text>
  <text start="4539.59" dur="6.42">the of the availability of the</text>

  <text start="4549.85" dur="5.88">not we have information that is reliable</text>
  <text start="4553.06" dur="5.64">enough and immediate and enough and</text>
  <text start="4555.73" dur="4.44">actionable enough to be able to notify a</text>
  <text start="4558.7" dur="3.03">victim the Department of Justice has a</text>
  <text start="4560.17" dur="5.7">set of guidelines that goes through that</text>
  <text start="4561.73" dur="6.54">they&amp;#39;ve recently been expanded to</text>

  <text start="4574.06" dur="3.99">of and we would expect to follow that</text>
  <text start="4576.25" dur="4.71">process I hope you&amp;#39;ll review that</text>

  <text start="5039.03" dur="5.25">to say what a privilege it is to</text>
  <text start="5041.31" dur="5.91">your testimony this morning and to know</text>

  <text start="5072.21" dur="4.44">watching this at home and in that spirit</text>
  <text start="5074.73" dur="3.24">actually director Coates I wanted to</text>
  <text start="5076.65" dur="4.86">start with something that you ended with</text>
  <text start="5077.97" dur="6.03">which was in observation about concerns</text>
  <text start="5081.51" dur="5.19">that the IC has about political</text>
  <text start="5084" dur="6.09">uncertainty in Europe and the ability</text>
  <text start="5086.7" dur="5.19">for European democracies to push back on</text>
  <text start="5090.09" dur="4.02">what you described as autocratic</text>
  <text start="5091.89" dur="6.75">tendencies can you say a little bit more</text>
  <text start="5094.11" dur="10.19">about that clearly Europe has seen</text>
  <text start="5098.64" dur="5.66">Russian aggression in hybrid ways</text>
  <text start="5104.66" dur="8.74">significant cyber incidents in trying to</text>
  <text start="5110.07" dur="6.03">influence not only their their view of</text>
  <text start="5113.4" dur="6.06">our alliance but their own view of their</text>
  <text start="5116.1" dur="7.89">their own alliance within Europe seeking</text>
  <text start="5119.46" dur="8.1">to sow divisions between countries and</text>
  <text start="5123.99" dur="9.5">between Europe in the United States it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5127.56" dur="8.97">interesting that some time ago at a at a</text>
  <text start="5133.49" dur="5.5">meeting with NATO intelligence officials</text>
  <text start="5136.53" dur="5.19">the question was raised by the director</text>
  <text start="5138.99" dur="5.52">did any of the 29 countries of Europe</text>
  <text start="5141.72" dur="4.29">not see Russian influence in their</text>
  <text start="5144.51" dur="3.24">countries and particularly in the</text>
  <text start="5146.01" dur="3.93">political processes of those countries</text>
  <text start="5147.75" dur="4.98">not one person raised their hand and</text>
  <text start="5149.94" dur="4.56">said I have not seen that all 29 have</text>
  <text start="5152.73" dur="3.69">seen some type of influence from the</text>
  <text start="5154.5" dur="5.82">Russia&amp;#39;s so it&amp;#39;s a persistent threat and</text>
  <text start="5156.42" dur="8.16">a pervasive threat that the EU needs to</text>
  <text start="5160.32" dur="11.3">address and we address with them through</text>
  <text start="5164.58" dur="7.04">our NATO coordination but</text>
  <text start="5171.81" dur="7.26">I think the warning is there I think the</text>
  <text start="5174.78" dur="11.94">the nations are aware of the threat we</text>
  <text start="5179.07" dur="9.96">see some some it issues that threaten</text>
  <text start="5186.72" dur="6.9">some of the some of the Alliance</text>
  <text start="5189.03" dur="7.41">coalition turkey is a member of the</text>
  <text start="5193.62" dur="4.83">might of NATO and yet we&amp;#39;re having some</text>
  <text start="5196.44" dur="4.83">issues with Turkey there in a very geo</text>
  <text start="5198.45" dur="4.5">strategic point in the world and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="5201.27" dur="3.48">been happy to have them with NATO so</text>
  <text start="5202.95" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;d like to keep them there I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5204.75" dur="4.71">know if I&amp;#39;m directly answering yes I</text>
  <text start="5206.73" dur="5.46">said what URI what about within the</text>
  <text start="5209.46" dur="5.16">domestic politics of those countries the</text>
  <text start="5212.19" dur="4.17">autocratic impulses you know whether</text>
  <text start="5214.62" dur="4.2">aligned with Russia are not aligned with</text>
  <text start="5216.36" dur="3.84">Russia well I I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="5218.82" dur="3.69">wariness about aligning with Russia</text>
  <text start="5220.2" dur="6.54">whether you&amp;#39;re your author terian</text>
  <text start="5222.51" dur="8.16">leadership or not we have seen some some</text>
  <text start="5226.74" dur="8.22">countries leaning in that direction</text>
  <text start="5230.67" dur="6.81">raising issues as to the strength of of</text>
  <text start="5234.96" dur="7.77">the Alliance a lot of that is related to</text>
  <text start="5237.48" dur="7.92">the economy to trade matters to a number</text>
  <text start="5242.73" dur="7.44">of issues beyond just just the just the</text>
  <text start="5245.4" dur="7.2">military in a minute I have left it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5250.17" dur="4.53">okay I want to switch to potential of</text>
  <text start="5252.6" dur="5.61">dual use capabilities that China may</text>
  <text start="5254.7" dur="5.61">attain through its one Road and one belt</text>
  <text start="5258.21" dur="4.02">and Road initiative recently there were</text>
  <text start="5260.31" dur="5.64">reports that China may press Pakistan</text>
  <text start="5262.23" dur="5.34">for military access as Pakistan Falls</text>
  <text start="5265.95" dur="4.65">more and more into China&amp;#39;s debt I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="5267.57" dur="4.62">concerned about data access China may</text>
  <text start="5270.6" dur="3.06">control through digital infrastructure</text>
  <text start="5272.19" dur="4.14">projects in countries around the world</text>
  <text start="5273.66" dur="5.28">what is the eye sees assessment of</text>
  <text start="5276.33" dur="3.84">potential dual use aspects of China&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5278.94" dur="3.54">belt and road initiative and what</text>
  <text start="5280.17" dur="5.13">threats do they pose to US interests</text>
  <text start="5282.48" dur="5.4">well I&amp;#39;d like to also Ken where I&amp;#39;d say</text>
  <text start="5285.3" dur="4.38">well you can look at the globe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5287.88" dur="4.29">called one belt one road in its global</text>
  <text start="5289.68" dur="4.41">and you can look at the map and see a</text>
  <text start="5292.17" dur="7.41">lot of strategic places where China has</text>
  <text start="5294.09" dur="7.86">a real interest in perhaps a dual effort</text>
  <text start="5299.58" dur="5.3">to not only provide infrastructure</text>
  <text start="5301.95" dur="6.11">support loan support for ports</text>
  <text start="5304.88" dur="6.48">airports of roads a lot of</text>
  <text start="5308.06" dur="6.15">infrastructure loans for to help with</text>
  <text start="5311.36" dur="6.51">their economy but also interests in</text>
  <text start="5314.21" dur="7.44">placing strategic military positions</text>
  <text start="5317.87" dur="6">we&amp;#39;ve seen that take place off the Horn</text>
  <text start="5321.65" dur="3.9">of Africa we&amp;#39;ve seen China looking at</text>
  <text start="5323.87" dur="3.74">different and if you look at the spots</text>
  <text start="5325.55" dur="4.74">where they&amp;#39;re where they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5327.61" dur="7.36">engaging and you see some geopolitical</text>
  <text start="5330.29" dur="6.3">and military aspects and with that so it</text>
  <text start="5334.97" dur="3.06">is it is dual and I&amp;#39;d like to turn a</text>
  <text start="5336.59" dur="4.94">general Ashleigh to give you a better</text>
  <text start="5338.03" dur="6.78">detail of what that looks like</text>
  <text start="5341.53" dur="4.54">so we can talk at a classified session</text>
  <text start="5344.81" dur="2.67">about the nature of the relationship</text>
  <text start="5346.07" dur="3.51">with Pakistan and I think we can</text>
  <text start="5347.48" dur="4.14">eliminate what you&amp;#39;re seeking there in</text>
  <text start="5349.58" dur="3.39">terms of dual use technologies there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="5351.62" dur="2.76">multitude of things out there and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5352.97" dur="3.09">not necessarily germane to the belt and</text>
  <text start="5354.38" dur="3.51">Road initiative it&amp;#39;s where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5356.06" dur="4.17">investing and part of that investment is</text>
  <text start="5357.89" dur="5.69">how they&amp;#39;re garnering intellectual</text>
  <text start="5360.23" dur="5.85">capital globally but think about quantum</text>
  <text start="5363.58" dur="4.57">from a communication standpoint from a</text>
  <text start="5366.08" dur="3.78">computing standpoint from a sensing</text>
  <text start="5368.15" dur="4.1">standpoint what those advanced sensors</text>
  <text start="5369.86" dur="5.01">could do if you look at genetics</text>
  <text start="5372.25" dur="5.29">bioengineering so there&amp;#39;s a multitude of</text>
  <text start="5374.87" dur="4.98">things whether it gets into human</text>
  <text start="5377.54" dur="4.02">engineering it gets into how do you cure</text>
  <text start="5379.85" dur="3.57">diseases but at the same time there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5381.56" dur="3.75">kind of the flipside nefarious aspect of</text>
  <text start="5383.42" dur="3.06">that and so there is a plus and a</text>
  <text start="5385.31" dur="2.97">negative side to the risk and the</text>
  <text start="5386.48" dur="4.05">medical there&amp;#39;s a agricultural aspect to</text>
  <text start="5388.28" dur="3.66">that which are very positive but could</text>
  <text start="5390.53" dur="2.85">have a negative impact as well so</text>
  <text start="5391.94" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s a number of things in terms of</text>
  <text start="5393.38" dur="4.05">advanced technologies where they are</text>
  <text start="5395.48" dur="4.2">investing that have dual use</text>
  <text start="5397.43" dur="3.92">capabilities that will really mature</text>
  <text start="5399.68" dur="6.03">over the course of the next decade</text>
  <text start="5401.35" dur="6.01">senator blunt thank you chairman thanks</text>

  <text start="5433.39" dur="9.82">director Cardillo in the</text>
  <text start="5437.989" dur="10.141">actually I saw the 60 Minutes over the</text>
  <text start="5443.21" dur="7.98">weekend talked about small satellite</text>
  <text start="5448.13" dur="6.54">data about all the commercial imagery</text>

  <text start="5466.969" dur="4.831">advantage of what&amp;#39;s out there that we</text>
  <text start="5468.8" dur="6.21">don&amp;#39;t have to produce ourselves but as</text>
  <text start="5471.8" dur="6.99">we do that what concerns do you have</text>
  <text start="5475.01" dur="6.72">about cyber activity that might in some</text>
  <text start="5478.79" dur="5.91">way impact that data or the data that we</text>
  <text start="5481.73" dur="6.27">get in other places what how would you</text>
  <text start="5484.7" dur="5.19">describe your concerns about cyber as it</text>
  <text start="5488" dur="5.33">relates to commercial data that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="5489.89" dur="5.34">made great steps in using and the other</text>
  <text start="5493.33" dur="4.96">geospatial that we produce ourselves</text>
  <text start="5495.23" dur="4.95">that may be disrupted before it gets</text>
  <text start="5498.29" dur="4.71">analyzed with information that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="5500.18" dur="5.61">really there thanks senator for the</text>
  <text start="5503" dur="4.83">question I don&amp;#39;t think there is a more</text>
  <text start="5505.79" dur="4.02">important issue on my desk or I would</text>
  <text start="5507.83" dur="4.86">offer the desk of my colleagues here and</text>
  <text start="5509.81" dur="8.6">that is at the heart of our profession</text>
  <text start="5512.69" dur="7.83">is integrity and credibility reliability</text>
  <text start="5518.41" dur="3.97">that&amp;#39;s how we get invited to meetings</text>
  <text start="5520.52" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s how we get invited back to</text>
  <text start="5522.38" dur="3.6">meetings to provide a sense of</text>
  <text start="5524.3" dur="3.81">confidence to those that we serve to</text>
  <text start="5525.98" dur="4.14">help them make decisions what you just</text>
  <text start="5528.11" dur="3.54">described is both an opportunity that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5530.12" dur="4.86">the connection with new partners</text>
  <text start="5531.65" dur="6.48">non-traditional sources small and large</text>
  <text start="5534.98" dur="5.4">companies and universities etc every one</text>
  <text start="5538.13" dur="5.93">of those connections is also a threat or</text>
  <text start="5540.38" dur="7.17">a risk because if if I&amp;#39;m now plugged in</text>
  <text start="5544.06" dur="5.58">to this new source to gain benefit</text>
  <text start="5547.55" dur="6.56">understanding coherence I&amp;#39;m also</text>
  <text start="5549.64" dur="7.329">plugging into every aspect of</text>
  <text start="5554.11" dur="5.08">vulnerability that they have so we work</text>
  <text start="5556.969" dur="5.191">on this very very hard I obviously count</text>
  <text start="5559.19" dur="4.529">on the experts at NSA and FBI on the on</text>
  <text start="5562.16" dur="4.23">the digital domain and the hygiene</text>
  <text start="5563.719" dur="4.711">that&amp;#39;s necessary I will also say because</text>
  <text start="5566.39" dur="4.6">it was brought up before this issue of</text>
  <text start="5568.43" dur="5.38">deep fake</text>
  <text start="5570.99" dur="6.69">as that technology in advances and it</text>
  <text start="5573.81" dur="5.7">will I do worry about as a community</text>
  <text start="5577.68" dur="4.47">that needs to seek the truth and then</text>
  <text start="5579.51" dur="7.32">speak the truth in a world in which we</text>
  <text start="5582.15" dur="7.83">can&amp;#39;t agree on what&amp;#39;s true our job</text>
  <text start="5586.83" dur="4.56">becomes much more difficult and so go</text>
  <text start="5589.98" dur="4.47">back to your question we have to do a</text>
  <text start="5591.39" dur="4.53">better job at protecting what we do so</text>
  <text start="5594.45" dur="2.64">that when we do show up you have the</text>
  <text start="5595.92" dur="3.33">confidence you know where it came from</text>
  <text start="5597.09" dur="4.47">you know how we handled it you know who</text>
  <text start="5599.25" dur="5.25">did or didn&amp;#39;t affect or manipulate it</text>
  <text start="5601.56" dur="4.95">and so again it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an issue</text>
  <text start="5604.5" dur="6.96">that&amp;#39;s in the center of my desk and and</text>
  <text start="5606.51" dur="7.26">all of our concerns in in your plans one</text>
  <text start="5611.46" dur="7.65">more question for you director in your</text>

  <text start="5658.32" dur="4.86">no I&amp;#39;ll expand so some four years ago</text>
  <text start="5661.62" dur="3.93">when I stepped into this privileged</text>
  <text start="5663.18" dur="5.04">position I challenged our team to think</text>
  <text start="5665.55" dur="4.68">differently about our value proposition</text>
  <text start="5668.22" dur="4.17">in a world that is much more open now in</text>
  <text start="5670.23" dur="3.69">which there&amp;#39;s many more sources of</text>
  <text start="5672.39" dur="4.32">information some good and some not so</text>
  <text start="5673.92" dur="6.36">good and so I coined a phrase we need to</text>
  <text start="5676.71" dur="5.13">succeed in the open I modified that a</text>
  <text start="5680.28" dur="3">few months later with some help of my</text>
  <text start="5681.84" dur="4.02">teammates I said what we really need to</text>
  <text start="5683.28" dur="4.77">succeed with the open and to your point</text>
  <text start="5685.86" dur="4.17">about our new campus in st. Louis which</text>
  <text start="5688.05" dur="3.63">we couldn&amp;#39;t be more excited about by the</text>
  <text start="5690.03" dur="4.92">way the infrastructure is closer to 100</text>
  <text start="5691.68" dur="5.55">years old but this is much more than an</text>
  <text start="5694.95" dur="3.81">infrastructure project I think of this</text>
  <text start="5697.23" dur="4.26">is a new canvas it&amp;#39;s almost a hundred</text>
  <text start="5698.76" dur="4.56">acres we can reimagine our profession on</text>
  <text start="5701.49" dur="2.85">that campus part of that reimagine ation</text>
  <text start="5703.32" dur="3.629">needs to be engaged</text>
  <text start="5704.34" dur="4.379">with that open community in a way that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5706.949" dur="4.141">protected and that&amp;#39;s knowing about who</text>
  <text start="5708.719" dur="3.75">and what we&amp;#39;re plugging into so we</text>
  <text start="5711.09" dur="3.6">couldn&amp;#39;t be more excited about the</text>
  <text start="5712.469" dur="5.341">ability to take the opportunity that we</text>
  <text start="5714.69" dur="4.92">have in st. Louis now to redefine that</text>
  <text start="5717.81" dur="3.659">value proposition in a more open world</text>
  <text start="5719.61" dur="4.319">in a more connected world in a world in</text>
  <text start="5721.469" dur="4.71">which we&amp;#39;re taking on sources that we</text>
  <text start="5723.929" dur="5.281">know when sources that we need to double</text>
  <text start="5726.179" dur="5.581">and triple-check and so the 40% you rep</text>
  <text start="5729.21" dur="5.009">you you referenced is just an estimate</text>
  <text start="5731.76" dur="4.439">that we have now but we just want to</text>
  <text start="5734.219" dur="3.48">build into that infrastructure knowing</text>
  <text start="5736.199" dur="3.931">that we&amp;#39;re going to have to work not</text>
  <text start="5737.699" dur="3.871">just in but with the open and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5740.13" dur="3.66">why we&amp;#39;ve laid out that marker at the</text>
  <text start="5741.57" dur="4.41">beginning in general Nexxus oni how does</text>
  <text start="5743.79" dur="8.55">this fit into what you do the whole idea</text>
  <text start="5745.98" dur="7.98">of gon of individual personal geography</text>
  <text start="5752.34" dur="3.75">all the things that we didn&amp;#39;t use to</text>
  <text start="5753.96" dur="5.25">have access to that we have access to</text>
  <text start="5756.09" dur="7.83">now and only using it but using it with</text>
  <text start="5759.21" dur="6.15">confidence so I think your initial</text>
  <text start="5763.92" dur="3">question with regards to the data</text>
  <text start="5765.36" dur="3.18">security is a very important one in the</text>

  <text start="5844.29" dur="4.44">taken and often with great sacrifice</text>
  <text start="5846.21" dur="4.26">so thank them please from all of us this</text>
  <text start="5848.73" dur="3.33">question is for directors Haspel coats</text>
  <text start="5850.47" dur="4.38">in general Ashley and it&amp;#39;s about North</text>
  <text start="5852.06" dur="4.44">Korea what would you say is the current</text>
  <text start="5854.85" dur="3.93">state of this threat from North Korea</text>
  <text start="5856.5" dur="5.64">and perhaps we can start with director</text>
  <text start="5858.78" dur="5.19">Haskell well briefly of course the</text>
  <text start="5862.14" dur="5.31">regime is committed to developing a</text>
  <text start="5863.97" dur="5.82">long-range nuclear or missile that would</text>
  <text start="5867.45" dur="5.58">pose a direct threat to the United</text>
  <text start="5869.79" dur="5.93">States it is positive that we have</text>
  <text start="5873.03" dur="5.4">managed to engage them in a dialogue</text>
  <text start="5875.72" dur="6.34">they have taken some voluntary measures</text>
  <text start="5878.43" dur="6.9">to close a site dismantle a site but</text>
  <text start="5882.06" dur="5.4">ultimately the objective is to lessen</text>
  <text start="5885.33" dur="3.62">that threat by getting them to declare</text>
  <text start="5887.46" dur="4.17">their program and then ultimately</text>
  <text start="5888.95" dur="7.47">dismantle the program I think others can</text>
  <text start="5891.63" dur="8.4">probably add to that dr. Coates</text>
  <text start="5896.42" dur="8.98">well I affirm what director Haspel has</text>
  <text start="5900.03" dur="8.43">just just said I think we we continue to</text>
  <text start="5905.4" dur="6.57">go into this situation eyes wide open we</text>
  <text start="5908.46" dur="5.34">want to employ the best assets we can to</text>
  <text start="5911.97" dur="3.87">understand what the Koreans are thinking</text>
  <text start="5913.8" dur="3.3">North Koreans are thinking and what</text>
  <text start="5915.84" dur="4.2">they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="5917.1" dur="5.46">we have capabilities which we can talk</text>
  <text start="5920.04" dur="5.76">about in a in a secure session in terms</text>
  <text start="5922.56" dur="5.4">of how we gather that information and</text>
  <text start="5925.8" dur="4.44">how we assess that to give to our</text>
  <text start="5927.96" dur="6.15">policymakers and to give to the</text>
  <text start="5930.24" dur="8.22">negotiating partners relative to where</text>
  <text start="5934.11" dur="8.03">we&amp;#39;re going with North Korea we be hold</text>
  <text start="5938.46" dur="8.22">to the stated premise that</text>
  <text start="5942.14" dur="7.18">denuclearization is is the goal which</text>
  <text start="5946.68" dur="5.76">has to be achieved but I will at that</text>
  <text start="5949.32" dur="5.31">point just say I want to ensure the</text>
  <text start="5952.44" dur="5.22">American people and ensure everybody</text>
  <text start="5954.63" dur="6.36">listening here that we are fully engaged</text>
  <text start="5957.66" dur="6.26">in in providing the essential</text>
  <text start="5960.99" dur="5.109">intelligence needed relative to the</text>
  <text start="5963.92" dur="4.52">negotiations that are going on</text>
  <text start="5966.099" dur="3.991">and in this setting can you say at least</text>
  <text start="5968.44" dur="4.139">since you&amp;#39;ve been in the position you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="5970.09" dur="3.69">been in that there threat in terms of</text>
  <text start="5972.579" dur="3">their ability to strike the United</text>
  <text start="5973.78" dur="5.399">States is diminished in any way</text>
  <text start="5975.579" dur="6.75">I think the assessments we&amp;#39;ve made up to</text>
  <text start="5979.179" dur="6.681">this particular point hold obviously as</text>
  <text start="5982.329" dur="6.421">I mentioned in my opening statement that</text>
  <text start="5985.86" dur="6.969">over this past year we have not seen any</text>
  <text start="5988.75" dur="6.869">evidence they have not done missile seen</text>
  <text start="5992.829" dur="5.011">a nuclear missile testing or launching</text>
  <text start="5995.619" dur="7.171">so that&amp;#39;s the position we&amp;#39;re in right</text>
  <text start="5997.84" dur="8.87">now but again we we keep an open eyes</text>
  <text start="6002.79" dur="6.949">and open ears to exactly what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="6006.71" dur="5.529">the technology that they demonstrated</text>
  <text start="6009.739" dur="4.98">from a technical standpoint there showed</text>
  <text start="6012.239" dur="5.041">a capability to have an ICBM function</text>
  <text start="6014.719" dur="4.9">still exists there still is a</text>
  <text start="6017.28" dur="4.98">substantial military capacity that Kim</text>
  <text start="6019.619" dur="4.23">jong-eun wields seventy percent of his</text>
  <text start="6022.26" dur="4.05">forces are along the DMZ</text>
  <text start="6023.849" dur="7.58">so the capabilities and threat that</text>
  <text start="6026.31" dur="7.289">existed here ago are still there and</text>
  <text start="6031.429" dur="3.94">director has and Thank You general</text>
  <text start="6033.599" dur="3.241">director Haspel North Korea has</text>
  <text start="6035.369" dur="4.29">obviously a terrible record of human</text>
  <text start="6036.84" dur="3.96">rights and they&amp;#39;re deeply isolated</text>
  <text start="6039.659" dur="5.21">obviously from the international</text>
  <text start="6040.8" dur="8.25">community and this is the result of many</text>
  <text start="6044.869" dur="6.221">policies intentional probably mostly do</text>
  <text start="6049.05" dur="3.839">you believe that North Korea values the</text>
  <text start="6051.09" dur="4.29">legitimacy that comes with direct</text>
  <text start="6052.889" dur="8.401">diplomatic engagement with the United</text>
  <text start="6055.38" dur="9.66">States yes I think our analysts would</text>
  <text start="6061.29" dur="6.51">assess that they value the dialogue with</text>
  <text start="6065.04" dur="6.78">the United States and we do we do see</text>
  <text start="6067.8" dur="8.97">indications that Kim jong-un is trying</text>
  <text start="6071.82" dur="6.72">to navigate a path toward some kind of</text>
  <text start="6076.77" dur="5.49">better future for the North Korean</text>
  <text start="6078.54" dur="7.199">people are you aware of any intelligence</text>
  <text start="6082.26" dur="5.76">suggesting that his behaviors and their</text>
  <text start="6085.739" dur="4.17">human rights record has improved in any</text>
  <text start="6088.02" dur="7.349">substantial way over the last couple of</text>
  <text start="6089.909" dur="8.071">years it&amp;#39;s obviously something we</text>
  <text start="6095.369" dur="5.051">monitor to the degree possible</text>
  <text start="6097.98" dur="4.75">I do think that</text>
  <text start="6100.42" dur="4.529">a vision for North Korea that further</text>
  <text start="6102.73" dur="4.949">brings them into the community of</text>
  <text start="6104.949" dur="4.801">nations would have a positive effect on</text>
  <text start="6107.679" dur="4.71">our ability to influence them on</text>
  <text start="6109.75" dur="4.11">important things like human rights but</text>
  <text start="6112.389" dur="4.201">over the last couple of years have you</text>
  <text start="6113.86" dur="4.29">seen any change in their behaviors I I</text>
  <text start="6116.59" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t think I can point to any specific</text>
  <text start="6118.15" dur="3.48">changes over the last couple of years</text>
  <text start="6120.1" dur="3.329">thank you</text>
  <text start="6121.63" dur="3.39">and then director coats changing the</text>
  <text start="6123.429" dur="5.011">subject and I&amp;#39;d like to talk with you a</text>
  <text start="6125.02" dur="6.179">bit about social media and can you tell</text>
  <text start="6128.44" dur="4.71">us has the I see do we have a written</text>
  <text start="6131.199" dur="4.321">strategy for how we&amp;#39;re going to counter</text>
  <text start="6133.15" dur="5.819">the influence operations that target</text>
  <text start="6135.52" dur="6.57">social media in the United States we are</text>
  <text start="6138.969" dur="6.21">fully engaged in that issue we have</text>

  <text start="6145.179" dur="5.761">sectors of the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="6147.489" dur="6.031">and much of that is shared both verbally</text>
  <text start="6150.94" dur="5.279">and in written form so there is a</text>
  <text start="6153.52" dur="5.219">written strategy not a written single</text>
  <text start="6156.219" dur="5.4">strategy but we&amp;#39;re always looking at how</text>
  <text start="6158.739" dur="6.271">we can best address this it&amp;#39;s a fluid</text>
  <text start="6161.619" dur="5.79">situation we had an earlier discussion</text>
  <text start="6165.01" dur="4.709">relative to our engagement with private</text>
  <text start="6167.409" dur="4.23">sector social media companies thank you</text>
  <text start="6169.719" dur="5.761">my time is running out can you tell us</text>
  <text start="6171.639" dur="6.631">do you have any intention of having a</text>
  <text start="6175.48" dur="5.639">written strategy that will be agreed to</text>
  <text start="6178.27" dur="5.07">and understood by all members of the IC</text>

  <text start="6194.29" dur="5.97">situation we are making significant</text>
  <text start="6196.63" dur="7.5">progress on that in terms of one</text>
  <text start="6200.26" dur="6.3">specific specific written strategy</text>
  <text start="6204.13" dur="7.58">something that has to will have to be</text>
  <text start="6206.56" dur="10.909">looked at in a continuum of change so</text>
  <text start="6211.71" dur="9.19">I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure why a written</text>
  <text start="6217.469" dur="5.891">strategy would give us anything more a</text>
  <text start="6220.9" dur="7.44">single strategy that would complete have</text>
  <text start="6223.36" dur="6.839">to be modified daily but but you can you</text>
  <text start="6228.34" dur="4.54">can be assured that it is a top priority</text>
  <text start="6230.199" dur="4.63">as we&amp;#39;ve talked about before</text>
  <text start="6232.88" dur="3.989">it is something that we are working on</text>
  <text start="6234.829" dur="4.04">and we&amp;#39;ve seen very significant progress</text>
  <text start="6236.869" dur="3.781">and so you go back and read the</text>
  <text start="6238.869" dur="3.401">transcript of what we talked about</text>
  <text start="6240.65" dur="3.929">before you all understand it I actually</text>
  <text start="6242.27" dur="4.26">have the transcript from February 13th</text>

  <text start="6410.61" dur="5.39">number in this forum I&amp;#39;ll say that they</text>
  <text start="6413.13" dur="5.79">they have hundreds of foreign fighters</text>
  <text start="6416" dur="4.96">the IC as a whole was working very very</text>
  <text start="6418.92" dur="4.679">hard to make sure we know who those are</text>
  <text start="6420.96" dur="8.009">return people to their country of origin</text>
  <text start="6423.599" dur="7.261">and to make sure that even as Isis as we</text>

  <text start="6437.28" dur="4.319">specific this afternoon in terms of the</text>
  <text start="6439.5" dur="4.889">exactly could you speak broadly about</text>
  <text start="6441.599" dur="4.111">the types of detainees are we talking</text>

  <text start="6450.96" dur="4.5">sort of thing all of the above senator</text>
  <text start="6453.36" dur="4.41">so it would be very bad for our nation</text>
  <text start="6455.46" dur="4.44">if those detainees were released I think</text>
  <text start="6457.77" dur="4.469">it would be very bad and the IC has</text>
  <text start="6459.9" dur="3.39">taken great pains to categorize and make</text>
  <text start="6462.239" dur="3.42">sure who we know who these individuals</text>
  <text start="6463.29" dur="4.77">are and we of course are working very</text>

  <text start="6470.04" dur="2.97">like to stay with you turn our attention</text>
  <text start="6471.57" dur="4.41">to Russia since I know you have a lot of</text>

  <text start="6475.98" dur="4.679">Putin has publicly stated that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="6477.96" dur="4.25">working on novel nuclear weapon systems</text>
  <text start="6480.659" dur="4.141">like a nuclear-powered cruise missile</text>
  <text start="6482.21" dur="4.9">hypersonic glide vehicles and underwater</text>
  <text start="6484.8" dur="3.81">nuclear-powered torpedo and just last</text>

  <text start="6488.61" dur="4.83">test of a hypersonic glide vehicle which</text>
  <text start="6491.73" dur="4.71">he called a new intercontinental</text>
  <text start="6493.44" dur="4.619">strategic system is it the case that</text>
  <text start="6496.44" dur="3.12">some of these systems are being designed</text>
  <text start="6498.059" dur="3.331">to explicitly</text>
  <text start="6499.56" dur="7.77">evade the constraints of the New START</text>
  <text start="6501.39" dur="8.76">treaty senator I believe and and I can</text>
  <text start="6507.33" dur="4.77">go into more detail this afternoon and</text>
  <text start="6510.15" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;m sure general Ashley would like to</text>
  <text start="6512.1" dur="4.92">add but I believe some of these systems</text>
  <text start="6514.5" dur="5.1">have in fact been in development long</text>
  <text start="6517.02" dur="5.13">before New START treaty you know Ashley</text>
  <text start="6519.6" dur="3.78">do you have anything to add actually if</text>
  <text start="6522.15" dur="3.78">I could get back real quick to your wall</text>
  <text start="6523.38" dur="4.08">way then I&amp;#39;ll come back to that one when</text>
  <text start="6525.93" dur="3.32">you look at the technology stuff and I</text>
  <text start="6527.46" dur="4.71">think Huawei and ZTE are great examples</text>
  <text start="6529.25" dur="4.36">but I think the other complexity is the</text>
  <text start="6532.17" dur="3.36">question really is do you know what&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="6533.61" dur="5.07">your phone not just is it a wall way or</text>
  <text start="6535.53" dur="4.53">ZT phone do you know who provided the</text>
  <text start="6538.68" dur="2.64">chips the software everything goes on</text>
  <text start="6540.06" dur="4.02">your phone</text>
  <text start="6541.32" dur="4.53">we&amp;#39;re tracking everything that that you</text>
  <text start="6544.08" dur="4.92">just address in terms of Putin I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="6545.85" dur="4.95">sure if that violates the New START</text>
  <text start="6549" dur="3.51">treaty because right now I know that the</text>
  <text start="6550.8" dur="4.86">Russians are in compliance and what news</text>
  <text start="6552.51" dur="5.01">as you know New START lays out for the</text>
  <text start="6555.66" dur="4.11">for the systems that can deliver it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6557.52" dur="5.19">about 700 they can have 15 50 in the</text>
  <text start="6559.77" dur="5.31">number of warheads and they can have 800</text>
  <text start="6562.71" dur="5.76">in the latter category in terms of other</text>
  <text start="6565.08" dur="5.01">systems I&amp;#39;m not aware that this violates</text>
  <text start="6568.47" dur="3.27">and let me I&amp;#39;ll take that one for a</text>
  <text start="6570.09" dur="3.21">little research as well and we may be</text>
  <text start="6571.74" dur="2.82">able to get that to you in the closed</text>
  <text start="6573.3" dur="3.09">session this afternoon thank you</text>
  <text start="6574.56" dur="4.35">director has for one final follow-up</text>
  <text start="6576.39" dur="4.65">questions so even if these systems don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="6578.91" dur="3.78">violate the New START treaty I believe</text>
  <text start="6581.04" dur="3.96">that both this and the past</text>

  <text start="6605.37" dur="3.15">obviously would have a different</text>
  <text start="6606.93" dur="3.75">interpretation but I do believe that</text>

  <text start="6885.469" dur="7.141">let me ask one other question for you</text>
  <text start="6889.73" dur="6.239">director Haspel and director Coates to</text>
  <text start="6892.61" dur="5.1">change the subject to Russia and</text>

  <text start="6910.94" dur="3.84">Coates</text>
  <text start="6911.42" dur="6.08">would this put you in a disadvantaged</text>
  <text start="6914.78" dur="6">position in terms of understanding</text>
  <text start="6917.5" dur="5.77">Russia&amp;#39;s efforts to advance its agenda</text>

  <text start="6932.66" dur="2.7">issue and it&amp;#39;s an issue but we ought to</text>
  <text start="6934.16" dur="5.7">talk about this afternoon</text>
  <text start="6935.36" dur="9.51">I look forward to discussing that in a</text>
  <text start="6939.86" dur="7.2">closed session mr. chairman my my time</text>
  <text start="6944.87" dur="6.75">is up to me from an intelligence</text>
  <text start="6947.06" dur="6.659">perspective it&amp;#39;s just Intel 101 that it</text>
  <text start="6951.62" dur="3.81">would help our country to know what</text>
  <text start="6953.719" dur="3.091">Vladimir Putin discussed with Donald</text>
  <text start="6955.43" dur="5.12">Trump and I want to respect the rules</text>
  <text start="6956.81" dur="6.69">thank you mister turn the corner when I</text>
  <text start="6960.55" dur="4.96">reflect on the number of people who lost</text>
  <text start="6963.5" dur="4.35">their lives as a result of man-made</text>
  <text start="6965.51" dur="4.709">causes of World War two by some</text>

  <text start="6970.219" dur="7.381">when we introduced the atomic bomb in</text>
  <text start="6973.76" dur="6.78">Nagasaki and Hiroshima and think about</text>
  <text start="6977.6" dur="4.55">how much more efficient we&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>
  <text start="6980.54" dur="5.85">when it comes to killing one another</text>
  <text start="6982.15" dur="6.22">potentially and I wanted to ask you</text>
  <text start="6986.39" dur="5.88">about weapons of mass destruction and</text>
  <text start="6988.37" dur="6.27">counter proliferation if the theory</text>
  <text start="6992.27" dur="5.55">behind mutually assured destruction and</text>
  <text start="6994.64" dur="6.78">deterrence is that none of the so-called</text>
  <text start="6997.82" dur="8.31">rational actors let&amp;#39;s say Russia China</text>
  <text start="7001.42" dur="6.59">for example would use nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="7006.13" dur="5.22">because they realize what that</text>
  <text start="7008.01" dur="6.16">consequences that would be we know we</text>
  <text start="7011.35" dur="5.67">have less than rational actors that are</text>
  <text start="7014.17" dur="6.89">either have acquired nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="7017.02" dur="7.14">thinking about North Korea certainly</text>
  <text start="7021.06" dur="5.44">Pakistan and India are staring a staring</text>
  <text start="7024.16" dur="4.4">at each other both of whom have nuclear</text>
  <text start="7026.5" dur="2.06">weapons</text>
  <text start="7028.88" dur="6.81">I worry that we we are not spending as</text>
  <text start="7033.11" dur="10.4">much time as we need to be focusing on</text>
  <text start="7035.69" dur="11.19">what is the most lethal threat to our</text>
  <text start="7043.51" dur="5.53">nation and also to the world I just let</text>
  <text start="7046.88" dur="3.57">me ask you specifically about Russia we</text>
  <text start="7049.04" dur="2.91">know Russia continues to be in a</text>
  <text start="7050.45" dur="4.46">material breach of the terms of the</text>
  <text start="7051.95" dur="6.18">intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty</text>
  <text start="7054.91" dur="4.99">most recently our NATO allies have</text>
  <text start="7058.13" dur="4.88">concluded that Russia&amp;#39;s in the process</text>
  <text start="7059.9" dur="5.94">of developing a ground-launched cruise</text>
  <text start="7063.01" dur="6.55">missile that&amp;#39;s a direct threat to</text>
  <text start="7065.84" dur="5.67">euro-atlantic security I personally</text>
  <text start="7069.56" dur="4.32">think it&amp;#39;s important for us to</text>
  <text start="7071.51" dur="4.44">adequately fund nuclear modernization</text>
  <text start="7073.88" dur="4.76">programs including the development of a</text>
  <text start="7075.95" dur="4.92">low-yield warhead and enhance the</text>
  <text start="7078.64" dur="4.83">capabilities of critical missile defense</text>
  <text start="7080.87" dur="6.12">systems I would also point out that</text>
  <text start="7083.47" dur="5.65">China is not bound by the standards</text>
  <text start="7086.99" dur="4.47">imposed by the INF treaty further</text>
  <text start="7089.12" dur="3.03">putting the u.s. in a compromising</text>
  <text start="7091.46" dur="6.27">position</text>
  <text start="7092.15" dur="7.11">director Coates does the intelligence</text>
  <text start="7097.73" dur="4.71">community assess that a complete</text>
  <text start="7099.26" dur="5.52">withdrawal from us of the u.s. from the</text>
  <text start="7102.44" dur="5.28">INF treaty would would pose a</text>
  <text start="7104.78" dur="5.42">significant national security risk to</text>
  <text start="7107.72" dur="2.48">the United States</text>
  <text start="7110.89" dur="7">well that risk is there whether we are</text>
  <text start="7114.46" dur="6.52">within we see Russia within the bounds</text>
  <text start="7117.89" dur="4.68">of the restraints on that or whether we</text>
  <text start="7120.98" dur="5.97">don&amp;#39;t because we know Russia has</text>
  <text start="7122.57" dur="7.2">violated the terms of that treaty and</text>
  <text start="7126.95" dur="5.37">has that capability and China so whether</text>
  <text start="7129.77" dur="4.52">we withdraw or not they&amp;#39;re still going</text>
  <text start="7132.32" dur="5.01">to have that capability that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="7134.29" dur="6.22">and director Haspel perhaps this would</text>
  <text start="7137.33" dur="4.95">be a question for you if the u.s.</text>
  <text start="7140.51" dur="4.17">withdraws from the INF treaty and I</text>
  <text start="7142.28" dur="4.77">welcome anybody&amp;#39;s comment on the panel</text>
  <text start="7144.68" dur="4.64">if the u.s. withdraws from the INF</text>
  <text start="7147.05" dur="5.85">treaty does the IC assess that Russia</text>
  <text start="7149.32" dur="6.31">will place INF range missiles in Cuba or</text>
  <text start="7152.9" dur="5.6">will they attempt to exert pressure in</text>
  <text start="7155.63" dur="2.87">some other way</text>
  <text start="7164.69" dur="4.39">senator what I can say and perhaps we</text>
  <text start="7167.219" dur="3.361">can go into more detail this afternoon</text>
  <text start="7169.08" dur="3.98">is we do see that Russia is very</text>
  <text start="7170.58" dur="5.94">concerned about our decision to withdraw</text>
  <text start="7173.06" dur="5.47">we do see also consideration of ways</text>
  <text start="7176.52" dur="4.949">they can push back due to their own</text>
  <text start="7178.53" dur="6.84">concerns about our forward posture in</text>
  <text start="7181.469" dur="6.151">Eastern Europe I think I&amp;#39;ll leave it</text>
  <text start="7185.37" dur="3.9">there for now and we can elaborate this</text>
  <text start="7187.62" dur="4.68">afternoon I&amp;#39;ll ask if general actually</text>
  <text start="7189.27" dur="5.04">would like to add something yeah I would</text>
  <text start="7192.3" dur="6.33">say that and we can get us more details</text>
  <text start="7194.31" dur="5.37">this afternoon that their their actions</text>
  <text start="7198.63" dur="2.1">are not consistent with the</text>
  <text start="7199.68" dur="3.03">ground-launched cruise mode so that you</text>
  <text start="7200.73" dur="4.259">already spoke about it has already been</text>
  <text start="7202.71" dur="6.06">filled it operationally so it is in it</text>
  <text start="7204.989" dur="5.191">is in utilization and available there</text>
  <text start="7208.77" dur="4.83">are actions and what they would do I</text>
  <text start="7210.18" dur="6.87">think would be symmetric to anything we</text>
  <text start="7213.6" dur="5.82">did to move additional capabilities</text>
  <text start="7217.05" dur="4.08">forward and then those particulars</text>
  <text start="7219.42" dur="5.04">symmetric actions we can talk about in</text>
  <text start="7221.13" dur="5.19">our closed session would anybody on the</text>
  <text start="7224.46" dur="3.81">panel care to talk about the live</text>
  <text start="7226.32" dur="6.5">statement with regard to put it</text>
  <text start="7228.27" dur="4.55">production of at low yield warhead</text>
  <text start="7233.12" dur="5.74">maybe general ashley i don&amp;#39;t know who</text>
  <text start="7236.28" dur="3.6">would be the appropriate person the</text>
  <text start="7238.86" dur="3.09">comment of whether we should be</text>
  <text start="7239.88" dur="3.24">developing correct yeah</text>
  <text start="7241.95" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;ll have to leave that to the</text>
  <text start="7243.12" dur="7.26">policymakers what were you alluded to is</text>
  <text start="7245.19" dur="7.47">our ability to kill and some of the</text>
  <text start="7250.38" dur="5.339">weapons that we&amp;#39;ve developed and then</text>
  <text start="7252.66" dur="4.02">the utilization and a strategy that</text>
  <text start="7255.719" dur="3.511">we&amp;#39;ve heard in the past from the</text>
  <text start="7256.68" dur="4.38">Russians of non strategic nuclear</text>
  <text start="7259.23" dur="3.9">weapons and whether or not a rational</text>
  <text start="7261.06" dur="3.99">actor would use those kinds of weapons</text>
  <text start="7263.13" dur="4.8">in the field we know that the Russians</text>
  <text start="7265.05" dur="4.29">have a first use policy the threshold</text>
  <text start="7267.93" dur="3.99">where they think that the Kremlin would</text>
  <text start="7269.34" dur="5.19">be at risk is probably what would drive</text>
  <text start="7271.92" dur="5.37">that first use whether that see that as</text>
  <text start="7274.53" dur="6.33">an escalatory control measure that they</text>
  <text start="7277.29" dur="6">would put into place I&amp;#39;ll leave it to</text>
  <text start="7280.86" dur="4.68">the parties policy approaches to</text>
  <text start="7283.29" dur="4.44">determine you know the utilization of</text>
  <text start="7285.54" dur="3.12">one of those weapons when we talked</text>
  <text start="7287.73" dur="3.42">about the use of nuclear weapons</text>
  <text start="7288.66" dur="3.66">specifically one of the things that you</text>
  <text start="7291.15" dur="1.92">know the threshold is pretty high on</text>
  <text start="7292.32" dur="2.52">there</text>
  <text start="7293.07" dur="4.169">which is why we see the manifestations</text>
  <text start="7294.84" dur="5.31">of things like hybrid war and if you</text>
  <text start="7297.239" dur="4.831">look at great power conflict it kind of</text>
  <text start="7300.15" dur="3.33">flatlined after World War Two and things</text>
  <text start="7302.07" dur="4.29">that have taken place in the world order</text>
  <text start="7303.48" dur="5.099">there&amp;#39;s been kind of the outgrowth of</text>
  <text start="7306.36" dur="4.56">Bretton Woods that the other thing that</text>
  <text start="7308.579" dur="5.25">has come to bear on keeping great power</text>
  <text start="7310.92" dur="8.219">conflict at bay has been the development</text>
  <text start="7313.829" dur="7.441">of nuclear weapons last but not least</text>
  <text start="7319.139" dur="3.661">Versailles Thank You mr. chairman</text>
  <text start="7321.27" dur="3.78">thank you to all six of you for being</text>
  <text start="7322.8" dur="3.66">here thanks to your officers and to your</text>
  <text start="7325.05" dur="4.41">to their families</text>
  <text start="7326.46" dur="4.83">you lead in represent a community of</text>
  <text start="7329.46" dur="3.36">folks who often have family disruptions</text>
  <text start="7331.29" dur="3.539">and there aren&amp;#39;t folks who know to thank</text>
  <text start="7332.82" dur="4.23">them so on behalf of this committee and</text>
  <text start="7334.829" dur="3.81">the American people Thank You general</text>
  <text start="7337.05" dur="3.96">naka Soni when you were confirmed before</text>
  <text start="7338.639" dur="3.571">the Armed Services Committee I asked you</text>
  <text start="7341.01" dur="3.99">a question about whether or not Russia</text>
  <text start="7342.21" dur="5.79">or China had ever suffered a sufficient</text>
  <text start="7345" dur="5.04">response to their cyber aggressions to a</text>
  <text start="7348" dur="5.19">warrant behavior change on their behalf</text>
  <text start="7350.04" dur="4.889">and you said no they had not at this</text>
  <text start="7353.19" dur="4.17">point in a classified setting how would</text>
  <text start="7354.929" dur="5.841">you answer in a non classified setting</text>
  <text start="7357.36" dur="6.629">how would you answer that question today</text>
  <text start="7360.77" dur="5.349">so senator I think the way that I answer</text>
  <text start="7363.989" dur="5.491">the question is first of all what has</text>
  <text start="7366.119" dur="6.511">changed since you and I talked last year</text>
  <text start="7369.48" dur="5.099">is the fact that I think that from our</text>
  <text start="7372.63" dur="4.5">work collectively across the interagency</text>
  <text start="7374.579" dur="6.091">in the government we have been able to</text>
  <text start="7377.13" dur="5.009">show effectiveness against primarily in</text>
  <text start="7380.67" dur="3.6">this case the Russians as we take a look</text>
  <text start="7382.139" dur="4.951">at our midterm elections whether or not</text>
  <text start="7384.27" dur="5.309">that spawns long term behavior change I</text>
  <text start="7387.09" dur="3.69">think that&amp;#39;s still to be determined but</text>
  <text start="7389.579" dur="2.701">starting this afternoon we can talk a</text>
  <text start="7390.78" dur="4.5">little bit more about some of the things</text>
  <text start="7392.28" dur="4.049">we have seen thank you for your work on</text>
  <text start="7395.28" dur="2.549">that and your success and I know</text>
  <text start="7396.329" dur="3.031">director Coates you&amp;#39;re gonna give us</text>
  <text start="7397.829" dur="3.481">some briefing on that this afternoon as</text>
  <text start="7399.36" dur="3.359">well I know that a number of people on</text>
  <text start="7401.31" dur="3.599">the committee have been anxious to get a</text>
  <text start="7402.719" dur="4.471">more fulsome report of some of the</text>
  <text start="7404.909" dur="4.351">successes of the IC from early November</text>
  <text start="7407.19" dur="3.63">and I would just like to publicly say</text>
  <text start="7409.26" dur="3.39">whatever portion of that that we can</text>
  <text start="7410.82" dur="4.109">Declassified for the American people to</text>
  <text start="7412.65" dur="4.44">know the successes of the US government</text>
  <text start="7414.929" dur="4.111">and Avira community I would urge that</text>
  <text start="7417.09" dur="4.92">kind of declassification or possible</text>
  <text start="7419.04" dur="4.74">director ray can you you have many</text>
  <text start="7422.01" dur="4.25">priorities at the bureau but can you</text>
  <text start="7423.78" dur="5.6">talk about threats we face with the</text>
  <text start="7426.26" dur="5.55">term tech war tech race maybe against</text>
  <text start="7429.38" dur="4.44">China and domestically when you think</text>
  <text start="7431.81" dur="4.44">about Bureau priorities looking at</text>
  <text start="7433.82" dur="4.14">different Chinese actions inside the</text>
  <text start="7436.25" dur="5.94">United States how do you rank those</text>
  <text start="7437.96" dur="6.48">priorities well first I would say that</text>
  <text start="7442.19" dur="4.86">the as I said earlier that I think China</text>
  <text start="7444.44" dur="5.82">writ large is the most significant</text>
  <text start="7447.05" dur="5.7">counterintelligence threat we face we</text>
  <text start="7450.26" dur="4.32">have economic espionage investigations</text>
  <text start="7452.75" dur="4.86">for example that&amp;#39;s just one piece of it</text>
  <text start="7454.58" dur="5.55">in virtually every one of our 56 field</text>
  <text start="7457.61" dur="6.42">offices and the number of those has</text>
  <text start="7460.13" dur="6.87">probably doubled over the last three or</text>
  <text start="7464.03" dur="4.38">four years and almost all of them not</text>
  <text start="7467" dur="4.92">all of them but almost all of them lead</text>
  <text start="7468.41" dur="5.37">back to China in addition to go anywhere</text>
  <text start="7471.92" dur="3.75">near sufficient resources for all those</text>
  <text start="7473.78" dur="4.53">investigations many of us used to ask</text>
  <text start="7475.67" dur="4.38">director Comey about jihadi threats</text>
  <text start="7478.31" dur="3.929">against the United States and we would</text>
  <text start="7480.05" dur="3.87">regularly say is the bureau sufficiently</text>
  <text start="7482.239" dur="4.461">resourced and we were told that as long</text>
  <text start="7483.92" dur="5.31">as the US was active killing jihadis or</text>
  <text start="7486.7" dur="4.39">partnering with allies in Syria to kill</text>
  <text start="7489.23" dur="3.21">what is jihadis who were sucked there he</text>
  <text start="7491.09" dur="2.58">thought there were sufficient domestic</text>
  <text start="7492.44" dur="3.57">resources in the bureau for</text>
  <text start="7493.67" dur="4.62">counterintelligence and for corporate</text>
  <text start="7496.01" dur="6">espionage purposes are you sufficiently</text>
  <text start="7498.29" dur="6">resourced well I would say this if the</text>

  <text start="7732.38" dur="2.73">quick just go back to our opening</text>
  <text start="7733.58" dur="2.88">question from the chairman where you</text>
  <text start="7735.11" dur="3.93">said are you concerned about our</text>
  <text start="7736.46" dur="4.88">protection of data so how do you get</text>
  <text start="7739.04" dur="5.46">deep fakes that are really really good</text>
  <text start="7741.34" dur="5.56">lots of data that&amp;#39;s how you train your</text>
  <text start="7744.5" dur="3.87">algorithms so it goes back to kind of</text>
  <text start="7746.9" dur="3.33">where we started the ability to protect</text>
  <text start="7748.37" dur="3.57">that information to preclude the</text>
  <text start="7750.23" dur="4.32">training of those algorithms to a degree</text>
  <text start="7751.94" dur="5.31">where you cannot tell the difference and</text>
  <text start="7754.55" dur="4.379">again our challenge is how do you build</text>
  <text start="7757.25" dur="5.28">the algorithm to identify the anomaly</text>
  <text start="7758.929" dur="9.091">because every deep fake has a flaw at</text>
  <text start="7762.53" dur="7.74">least now they do thanks general Thank</text>

  <text start="7783.14" dur="4.11">have worked on this very hard we</text>
  <text start="7785.42" dur="4.92">appreciate the progress you&amp;#39;ve that had</text>
  <text start="7787.25" dur="5.159">been made I hope is we can I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="7790.34" dur="4.649">about down to about 500,000 I think that</text>
  <text start="7792.409" dur="5.491">still we can do much much better and my</text>
  <text start="7794.989" dur="5.821">hope would be that particularly any</text>
  <text start="7797.9" dur="5.43">federal employee that might have had</text>
  <text start="7800.81" dur="6.53">some level of a credit dinging due to</text>
  <text start="7803.33" dur="6.93">the shutdown would not be penalized</text>
  <text start="7807.34" dur="6.01">through that sort of security clearance</text>
  <text start="7810.26" dur="6.3">process from again actions quite frankly</text>
  <text start="7813.35" dur="7.789">that they had no ability to meet and to</text>
  <text start="7816.56" dur="7.53">remediate it was our responsibility we</text>

  <text start="7830.559" dur="8.25">enough shut down deferred some tasks</text>
  <text start="7836.05" dur="6.6">that we could have accomplished if if</text>
  <text start="7838.809" dur="7.071">the process was was opened and hopefully</text>
  <text start="7842.65" dur="3.23">we won&amp;#39;t have to go through that again</text>
  <text start="7854.039" dur="3.93">let&amp;#39;s try it over here and I thank the</text>
