  <text start="91.78" dur="4.229">Catholic Church large Midwestern</text>
  <text start="93.1" dur="5.79">Catholic family we had 10 kids went to</text>
  <text start="96.009" dur="4.411">church every Sunday and you know I did</text>

  <text start="106.229" dur="4.691">abuse in the church when I was a kid</text>
  <text start="108.97" dur="5.849">that just wasn&amp;#39;t something that happened</text>
  <text start="110.92" dur="6.42">in the area where we lived but when I</text>
  <text start="114.819" dur="3.901">got to be 12 or 13 I I just got fed up</text>
  <text start="117.34" dur="4.29">with church I didn&amp;#39;t want to go anymore</text>
  <text start="118.72" dur="6">I saw a lot of hypocrisy in the church</text>
  <text start="121.63" dur="6.39">and if you&amp;#39;re a Catholic please don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="124.72" dur="6.75">send me an angry message or email saying</text>
  <text start="128.02" dur="5.7">that you know what I experience is not</text>
  <text start="131.47" dur="4.17">typical of every church I know that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="133.72" dur="3.269">been in a lot of churches Protestant</text>
  <text start="135.64" dur="3.45">churches and a lot of different ones and</text>
  <text start="136.989" dur="5.131">I&amp;#39;ve gone to all kinds of charismatic</text>
  <text start="139.09" dur="5.88">churches and and Methodists and all</text>
  <text start="142.12" dur="4.89">kinds and I know that there is hypocrisy</text>
  <text start="144.97" dur="3.39">in some and all churches I get that you</text>
  <text start="147.01" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t have to message me all angry</text>
  <text start="148.36" dur="4.2">because I walked away from the Catholic</text>
  <text start="151.54" dur="4.11">Church just relax</text>
  <text start="152.56" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s cool that this this is not about</text>
  <text start="155.65" dur="7.919">church this is about God all right so I</text>
  <text start="158.92" dur="6.12">lived as I got older as a teenager I got</text>
  <text start="163.569" dur="4.021">very interested in science and biology</text>
  <text start="165.04" dur="5.699">got into college took some biology</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="8.929">classes it was very interested in</text>
  <text start="170.739" dur="8.731">chemistry biology so the sciences and I</text>
  <text start="176.519" dur="7.081">became very interested in Darwinism and</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="9.78">evolution and I became convinced that</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="7.3">the earth was created by natural forces</text>
  <text start="189.25" dur="5.03">I was a Darwinist I was a hardcore</text>
  <text start="190.9" dur="5.49">Darwinist and I hated religious people I</text>
  <text start="194.28" dur="4.51">especially hated born-again Christians</text>
  <text start="196.39" dur="5.67">and I hated people who claim they heard</text>
  <text start="198.79" dur="5.61">God&amp;#39;s voice in my mind people who</text>
  <text start="202.06" dur="7.23">claimed that they heard God&amp;#39;s voice were</text>
  <text start="204.4" dur="7.89">probably psychotic or or whatever</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="4.199">hearing voices I did not believe anyone</text>
  <text start="212.29" dur="5.58">heard God&amp;#39;s voice because I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="213.489" dur="11.581">believe God existed right and then when</text>
  <text start="217.87" dur="10.11">I was about 38 years old I had a series</text>
  <text start="225.07" dur="5.12">of life events and I&amp;#39;m not going to go</text>
  <text start="227.98" dur="5.94">into the long story it&amp;#39;s a long story</text>
  <text start="230.19" dur="6.82">but I kind of burned some bridges at</text>
  <text start="233.92" dur="8.219">work I had a friend who&amp;#39;s a paramedic</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="7.14">partner and my arrogance and pride had</text>
  <text start="242.139" dur="3.421">destroyed our friendship we were very</text>
  <text start="244.15" dur="4.85">very good friends we were very tight</text>
  <text start="245.56" dur="6.179">very close and my arrogance and pride</text>
  <text start="249" dur="4.72">destroyed a friendship and I was</text>
  <text start="251.739" dur="6.571">miserable I was a miserable person for</text>
  <text start="253.72" dur="6.72">that whole year it caused a lot of</text>
  <text start="258.31" dur="8.579">problems at work caused a lot of</text>
  <text start="260.44" dur="9.96">problems with relationships and in at</text>
  <text start="266.889" dur="7.051">that time I got in touch with a picked</text>
  <text start="270.4" dur="4.95">up a book called Left Behind and I</text>
  <text start="273.94" dur="7.26">actually read the entire Left Behind</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="7.98">series and the first book in the Left</text>
  <text start="281.2" dur="4.86">Behind series there was a character</text>
  <text start="283.33" dur="3.33">named Rayford Steele who&amp;#39;s an airline</text>
  <text start="286.06" dur="3.39">pilot</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="5.82">and I identified pretty strongly with</text>
  <text start="289.45" dur="6.51">this character he was a lot like me he</text>
  <text start="292.48" dur="4.83">he thought it was a good person I mean</text>
  <text start="295.96" dur="4.53">he didn&amp;#39;t go to church he wasn&amp;#39;t very</text>
  <text start="297.31" dur="5.48">religious but he he helped other people</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="4.56">and he thought he was a good person and</text>
  <text start="302.79" dur="3.85">and I thought I was a good person and</text>
  <text start="305.05" dur="4.95">even though I didn&amp;#39;t believe in God I</text>
  <text start="306.64" dur="5.34">did believe that if God existed and if</text>
  <text start="310" dur="4.95">Heaven existed I would certainly get</text>
  <text start="311.98" dur="5.34">into heaven when I died because I was a</text>
  <text start="314.95" dur="5.13">good person I was a paramedic I saved</text>
  <text start="317.32" dur="4.68">people&amp;#39;s lives I you know did all kinds</text>

  <text start="346.6" dur="6.09">of eternity is woven into the story and</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="4.45">Rayford Steele comes to the awareness</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="5.3">that he wasn&amp;#39;t such a good person he&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="724.6" dur="7.56">could still hear the voice but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="729.3" dur="4.57">God&amp;#39;s voice and this is the thing that</text>
  <text start="732.16" dur="4.53">if you take nothing else away from this</text>
  <text start="733.87" dur="5.79">conversation God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="736.69" dur="7.04">generally speaking the way we perceive</text>
  <text start="739.66" dur="6.93">God&amp;#39;s voice is through our thoughts and</text>
  <text start="743.73" dur="6.49">a lot of people think they don&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="746.59" dur="4.97">God&amp;#39;s voice when in fact they are</text>
  <text start="750.22" dur="4.35">hearing God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="751.56" dur="7.15">they just don&amp;#39;t recognize what it sounds</text>
  <text start="754.57" dur="5.67">like a lot of people have been told if</text>
  <text start="758.71" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re hearing God&amp;#39;s voice you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="760.24" dur="3.6">to hear an audible voice that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="762.04" dur="5.58">was I was hearing something like an</text>
  <text start="763.84" dur="7.11">audible voice and in later chapters in</text>
  <text start="767.62" dur="5.37">this book in future messages we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="770.95" dur="4.17">to talk about the audible voice of God</text>
  <text start="772.99" dur="4.62">and what that actually means what it</text>
  <text start="775.12" dur="4.53">sounds like and there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="777.61" dur="5.52">misinformation about the audible voice</text>
  <text start="779.65" dur="6">of God but I&amp;#39;ll just say this at that</text>
  <text start="783.13" dur="5.67">time when I first became born-again</text>
  <text start="785.65" dur="6.54">I heard what seemed to me like an</text>
  <text start="788.8" dur="5.97">audible voice of course it wasn&amp;#39;t an</text>
  <text start="792.19" dur="4.76">actual audible voice because if it was</text>
  <text start="794.77" dur="3.99">an audible voice making a sound</text>
  <text start="796.95" dur="3.76">everybody around me would hear it and</text>
  <text start="798.76" dur="4.53">they weren&amp;#39;t not hearing what I was</text>
  <text start="800.71" dur="5.19">hearing it was an internal voice it</text>
  <text start="803.29" dur="4.23">sounded like an audible voice to me but</text>
  <text start="805.9" dur="6.44">it was actually an internal voice</text>
  <text start="807.52" dur="7.56">because nobody else could hear it okay</text>
  <text start="812.34" dur="5.08">that&amp;#39;s the thing that most people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="815.08" dur="4.66">understand about hearing God&amp;#39;s voice do</text>
  <text start="817.42" dur="6.58">you think loud booming you know</text>
  <text start="819.74" dur="6.15">Moses up on top of the mountain hearing</text>
  <text start="824" dur="2.46">God talking to him loud audible voice</text>
  <text start="825.89" dur="5.58">right</text>
  <text start="826.46" dur="7.26">well no not most of the time most of the</text>
  <text start="831.47" dur="6.69">time when you hear God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="833.72" dur="8.9">it is not a loud audible voice it God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="838.16" dur="6.78">speaking to us sounds like our thoughts</text>
  <text start="842.62" dur="6.43">the way that you know that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="844.94" dur="6.75">hearing God&amp;#39;s voice is the content the</text>
  <text start="849.05" dur="5.07">thoughts that you hear are not your own</text>
  <text start="851.69" dur="4.74">thoughts now when I heard this other</text>
  <text start="854.12" dur="4.29">voice talking to me I was like well</text>
  <text start="856.43" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s not me that&amp;#39;s not those aren&amp;#39;t my</text>
  <text start="858.41" dur="3.9">thoughts that&amp;#39;s not the way I think and</text>
  <text start="860.81" dur="5.82">that&amp;#39;s not the kind of things that I</text>
  <text start="862.31" dur="9.75">would say this voice was internal but it</text>
  <text start="866.63" dur="9.96">was not me okay so a lot of people hear</text>
  <text start="872.06" dur="7.89">demonic voices a lot of people who end</text>
  <text start="876.59" dur="5.31">up you know shooting dozens of people</text>
  <text start="879.95" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re hearing demonic voices they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="881.9" dur="8.04">hearing voices in their head they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="884.48" dur="8.07">hanging other voices right so there are</text>
  <text start="889.94" dur="5.22">a lot of voices out there in the</text>
  <text start="892.55" dur="4.83">spiritual world that can talk to you you</text>

  <text start="898.97" dur="5.37">voice of the Holy Spirit and you can and</text>
  <text start="900.5" dur="6.57">then there&amp;#39;s your own thoughts the key</text>
  <text start="904.34" dur="5.1">to learning to hear God&amp;#39;s voice is</text>
  <text start="907.07" dur="5.25">learning to distinguish the difference</text>
  <text start="909.44" dur="4.47">between demonic voices and gellick</text>
  <text start="912.32" dur="4.11">voices and the voice of the Holy Spirit</text>

  <text start="955.069" dur="6.21">ways God speaks to us and the key is the</text>
  <text start="959.569" dur="4.411">key isn&amp;#39;t learning to discern the</text>
  <text start="961.279" dur="5.941">different ways in which God speaks and</text>
