  <text start="27.39" dur="7.59">is a real contrast to yesterday because</text>
  <text start="31.82" dur="5.8">yesterday was the slowest news day I can</text>
  <text start="34.98" dur="7.8">ever remember in fact the biggest news</text>
  <text start="37.62" dur="7.56">story ended up being fake news but this</text>
  <text start="42.78" dur="7.2">story that broke and it ended up being</text>
  <text start="45.18" dur="8.519">well not so true so today different</text>

  <text start="53.699" dur="2.941">go down my Twitter timeline and just</text>
  <text start="55.289" dur="3.59">read out some of the news stories that</text>
  <text start="56.64" dur="6.71">I&amp;#39;ve caught a so first big news</text>
  <text start="58.879" dur="9.251">president Trump recognizes Jerusalem as</text>
  <text start="63.35" dur="6.19">the official capital of Israel not a big</text>
  <text start="68.13" dur="4.38">surprise he promised that he would do</text>
  <text start="69.54" dur="6.36">that and there are plans to move the</text>
  <text start="72.51" dur="7.23">embassy to Jerusalem and the interesting</text>

  <text start="92.88" dur="6.059">their embassies to Jerusalem so Trump is</text>
  <text start="96.42" dur="3.51">leading the charge on this and I think</text>

  <text start="109.049" dur="4.86">mean that the Palestinian people won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="6.33">have their own state it just means that</text>
  <text start="113.909" dur="5.791">it&amp;#39;s that Trump is following through on</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="6.471">what Congress said they were going to do</text>

  <text start="233.38" dur="6.09">hurt me or kill me this story is still</text>
  <text start="235.27" dur="6.18">going to publish the big story is he has</text>
  <text start="239.47" dur="4.8">been doing research in the FBI Thomas</text>
  <text start="241.45" dur="5.28">Paine is former cop he has a lot of well</text>
  <text start="244.27" dur="4.53">true pundit is actually run by former</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="6.89">law enforcement officers they have a lot</text>
  <text start="248.8" dur="7.53">of connections in the FBI and whenever</text>
  <text start="253.62" dur="5.02">true pundit publishes something about</text>
  <text start="256.33" dur="4.8">the FBI I pay attention to it because</text>
  <text start="258.64" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s usually very good information he</text>
  <text start="261.13" dur="3.52">has good sources and he published an</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="4.21">article today</text>
  <text start="264.65" dur="6.39">saying that there are many female and</text>
  <text start="268.1" dur="7.11">male agents in the FBI who have</text>
  <text start="271.04" dur="7.77">complained filed reports about sexual</text>
  <text start="275.21" dur="6.06">harassment sexual abuse from co-workers</text>
  <text start="278.81" dur="5.85">and supervisors and a lot of that has</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="5.07">been buried cover-up ignored and people</text>
  <text start="284.66" dur="3.81">have been actually blackmailed and</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="5.16">extortion has been used against them to</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="6.99">get them to be quiet so that story is</text>
  <text start="291.5" dur="6.24">out there we&amp;#39;ll see where that goes</text>
  <text start="295.46" dur="4.44">Christopher Rea who is head of the FBI</text>
  <text start="297.74" dur="8.179">has a big job in front of him to clean</text>
  <text start="299.9" dur="9.45">that department up let&amp;#39;s see the</text>
  <text start="305.919" dur="7.421">concealed carry national reciprocity</text>
  <text start="309.35" dur="5.61">bill passed the House and it is going on</text>
  <text start="313.34" dur="3.75">to the Senate that was another thing</text>
  <text start="314.96" dur="4.679">that the president promised he said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="317.09" dur="6">going to support a national reciprocity</text>
  <text start="319.639" dur="6.06">for concealed carry and that is going on</text>
  <text start="323.09" dur="6.21">to the house if that passes that will be</text>
  <text start="325.699" dur="5.161">I think I think very good I think if you</text>
  <text start="329.3" dur="3.96">can figure out that if the country is</text>
  <text start="330.86" dur="5.67">going to allow you to conceal carry a</text>
  <text start="333.26" dur="5.61">handgun it should be anywhere in the</text>
  <text start="336.53" dur="3.75">country or it shouldn&amp;#39;t be at all and</text>
  <text start="338.87" dur="3.66">the Constitution guarantees is that</text>
  <text start="340.28" dur="5.34">right and government overreach has</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="5.79">restricted our ability to carry and and</text>
  <text start="345.62" dur="5.57">it&amp;#39;s unconstitutional so I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="348.32" dur="2.87">that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="352.539" dur="13.091">let&amp;#39;s see going down here News News News</text>
  <text start="360.22" dur="9.699">Oh interesting thing not very heavily</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="6.87">reported but yesterday there was an</text>
  <text start="369.919" dur="9.18">impromptu press conference that was held</text>
  <text start="372.5" dur="9.15">by get Jim Jordan Mark Meadows Andy</text>
  <text start="379.099" dur="4.32">Biggs a lot of the freedom caucus they</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="4.019">got together and they filmed a little</text>
  <text start="383.419" dur="4.191">seven-minute YouTube video where they</text>
  <text start="385.669" dur="4.881">essentially called out Jeff Sessions and</text>
  <text start="387.61" dur="6.25">told him that they are demanding that</text>
  <text start="390.55" dur="6.07">the Department of Justice look into</text>
  <text start="393.86" dur="5.46">Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="396.62" dur="4.23">that they&amp;#39;re not fit in this anymore and</text>
  <text start="399.32" dur="3.24">again this is on the assumption that</text>
  <text start="400.85" dur="5.46">nothing is going on in the Department of</text>
  <text start="402.56" dur="7.079">Justice with respect to Hillary and you</text>
  <text start="406.31" dur="4.859">know my take on that is still you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="409.639" dur="4.621">you don&amp;#39;t really know what is going on</text>
  <text start="411.169" dur="4.831">inside the DOJ unless they tell you if</text>
  <text start="414.26" dur="3.6">they don&amp;#39;t come out with a report that</text>
  <text start="416" dur="3.449">says here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re investigating you</text>
  <text start="417.86" dur="4.05">never know what they&amp;#39;re investigating so</text>
  <text start="419.449" dur="4.621">a lot of people could be very angry and</text>
  <text start="421.91" dur="4.89">upset and mad because they think there</text>
  <text start="424.07" dur="4.8">was no investigation going on when in</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="5.76">fact there may be an investigation going</text>
  <text start="428.87" dur="5.88">on we don&amp;#39;t really know that right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="432.56" dur="3.99">hard to know because they don&amp;#39;t confirm</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="6.3">or deny the existence of investigations</text>
  <text start="436.55" dur="7.05">so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s difficult to know but they</text>
  <text start="441.05" dur="3.69">they held a little press conference and</text>
  <text start="443.6" dur="1.53">demanded that something be done about</text>
  <text start="444.74" dur="11.25">that</text>
  <text start="445.13" dur="14.099">oh let&amp;#39;s see what else is going on just</text>
  <text start="455.99" dur="6.95">looking over might my timeline here that</text>
  <text start="459.229" dur="3.711">is kind of the biggest breaking news</text>
  <text start="463.03" dur="4.3">Chuck Grassley just called out a Senate</text>
  <text start="465.41" dur="3.05">and and look here&amp;#39;s something to think</text>
  <text start="467.33" dur="7.74">about</text>
  <text start="468.46" dur="10.63">last month the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="475.07" dur="7.529">wrote a letter to the Judiciary</text>
  <text start="479.09" dur="6.09">Committee telling them that they were at</text>
  <text start="482.599" dur="5.54">the request of many different</text>
  <text start="485.18" dur="5.79">intelligence committees and the and the</text>
  <text start="488.139" dur="8.021">Judiciary Committee that they were going</text>
  <text start="490.97" dur="10.65">to read open and look into issues such</text>
  <text start="496.16" dur="8.009">as the Clinton Foundation James commis</text>
  <text start="501.62" dur="4.979">handling of the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="504.169" dur="5.701">investigation the way that that was</text>
  <text start="506.599" dur="4.771">handled they&amp;#39;re looking into Andrew</text>
  <text start="509.87" dur="4.049">McCabe who is the Deputy Director</text>
  <text start="511.37" dur="5.25">they&amp;#39;re looking into his decision not to</text>
  <text start="513.919" dur="4.56">recuse himself from having oversight of</text>
  <text start="516.62" dur="4.71">the email investigation they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="518.479" dur="6.571">into all these things DOJ has told</text>
  <text start="521.33" dur="5.43">Congress we&amp;#39;re looking into anything</text>
  <text start="525.05" dur="4.23">that needs more resources more</text>
  <text start="526.76" dur="3.72">investigators we&amp;#39;re evaluating whether</text>
  <text start="529.28" dur="4.29">any of that needs a special</text>
  <text start="530.48" dur="4.979">prosecutor so I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t quite</text>
  <text start="533.57" dur="5.069">understand why people are having all</text>
  <text start="535.459" dur="4.531">this heartache over the this idea that</text>
  <text start="538.639" dur="2.82">Department of Justice isn&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="539.99" dur="4.26">anything they said a month ago they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="541.459" dur="4.49">looking into all of us so I don&amp;#39;t know</text>

  <text start="698.13" dur="4.35">not news and that&amp;#39;s why a lot of people</text>
  <text start="700.38" dur="5.43">thought and still think that Muller is a</text>
  <text start="702.48" dur="4.29">bad guy well so now we&amp;#39;re getting text</text>
  <text start="705.81" dur="3.18">messages or we&amp;#39;re getting information</text>

  <text start="731.88" dur="9.15">we&amp;#39;ve known this forever so again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="737.67" dur="5.61">easy to look at those things and get</text>
  <text start="741.03" dur="4.25">distracted from what&amp;#39;s going on behind</text>
  <text start="743.28" dur="4.92">the scenes that is I think is much more</text>
  <text start="745.28" dur="5.35">important and I&amp;#39;m going to talk for the</text>
  <text start="748.2" dur="5.46">rest of this message about the things</text>
  <text start="750.63" dur="6.96">that I think are much more important all</text>
  <text start="753.66" dur="6.99">that stuff too in my mind is distraction</text>
  <text start="757.59" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s just distraction it&amp;#39;s people</text>
  <text start="760.65" dur="3.63">wanting you to click on their articles</text>
  <text start="762.81" dur="2.73">click on their websites and all this</text>
  <text start="764.28" dur="3.65">other stuff in it to me it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="765.54" dur="4.8">distraction it&amp;#39;s just getting people</text>
  <text start="767.93" dur="4.3">wrapped up and getting them all angry</text>
  <text start="770.34" dur="2.49">over stuff this stuff that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="772.23" dur="3.96">really matter</text>
  <text start="772.83" dur="4.58">and so let&amp;#39;s talk about some things that</text>
  <text start="776.19" dur="5.36">do matter and let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="777.41" dur="7.42">speaking of Muller&amp;#39;s investigation okay</text>
  <text start="781.55" dur="7.12">Kennedy probably is acting all right you</text>
  <text start="784.83" dur="6">have to realize Kennedy is trying to get</text>
  <text start="788.67" dur="3.99">ratings he&amp;#39;s trying to sell he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="790.83" dur="5.34">to promote things he&amp;#39;s trying to get the</text>
  <text start="792.66" dur="6.27">Fox brand to get people to tune in</text>
  <text start="796.17" dur="3.78">all of that hysteria there&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="798.93" dur="4.08">bit of theater involved in that</text>
  <text start="799.95" dur="5.879">hopefully you know that all right but to</text>
  <text start="803.01" dur="5.22">me I find theater annoying if it&amp;#39;s bad</text>
  <text start="805.829" dur="4.711">theater look if it&amp;#39;s good acting and</text>
  <text start="808.23" dur="4.049">it&amp;#39;s well-written and its scripted well</text>
  <text start="810.54" dur="4.409">there&amp;#39;s good directing hey sign me up</text>
  <text start="812.279" dur="5.581">for if it&amp;#39;s bad acting and if it&amp;#39;s bad</text>
  <text start="814.949" dur="6.63">scripting I have a hard time sitting</text>
  <text start="817.86" dur="6.599">through it I especially don&amp;#39;t like a bad</text>
  <text start="821.579" dur="5.07">script I don&amp;#39;t like a screenplay that</text>
  <text start="824.459" dur="3.87">isn&amp;#39;t written very well one of the</text>
  <text start="826.649" dur="3.63">biggest complaints if you go to to a</text>
  <text start="828.329" dur="4.141">theater with me and watch a movie if</text>
  <text start="830.279" dur="4.381">there is a bad screenplay I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="832.47" dur="2.609">be on their case about it that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="834.66" dur="5.03">how I am</text>
  <text start="835.079" dur="8.671">I don&amp;#39;t like poorly written screenplays</text>
  <text start="839.69" dur="8.37">so let&amp;#39;s go back to Muller and his team</text>
  <text start="843.75" dur="4.31">and the fact that they&amp;#39;re being outed as</text>
  <text start="848.089" dur="7.081">Clinton supporters and biased now now we</text>
  <text start="851.49" dur="7.649">knew that but what&amp;#39;s interesting is</text>
  <text start="855.17" dur="6.43">there&amp;#39;s two layers to this onion there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="859.139" dur="4.89">the first layer which says they are</text>
  <text start="861.6" dur="3.66">biased and they&amp;#39;re partisan and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="864.029" dur="3.781">not objective and how can they</text>
  <text start="865.26" dur="5.009">investigate fairly okay that&amp;#39;s the first</text>
  <text start="867.81" dur="6.48">layer this second layer which is the one</text>
  <text start="870.269" dur="8.911">I&amp;#39;m interested in says where did the</text>
  <text start="874.29" dur="7.89">information come from who is picking up</text>
  <text start="879.18" dur="6.269">the phone calls the text messages and</text>
  <text start="882.18" dur="6.33">the emails between these people where is</text>
  <text start="885.449" dur="6.591">that information coming from so when I</text>
  <text start="888.51" dur="7.68">see this kind of information coming up I</text>
  <text start="892.04" dur="5.44">think okay who&amp;#39;s leaking how did they</text>
  <text start="896.19" dur="1.589">get the information where did it come</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="2.28">from</text>
  <text start="897.779" dur="3.571">and what&amp;#39;s their agenda that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="899.76" dur="8.85">looking at I&amp;#39;m looking at the deeper</text>
  <text start="901.35" dur="9.84">layer of the onion so who has who had</text>
  <text start="908.61" dur="6.029">this information text messages phone</text>
  <text start="911.19" dur="5.25">calls and email is raw information it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="914.639" dur="5.81">raw data that is collected by the</text>
  <text start="916.44" dur="6.75">National Security Agency NSA okay</text>
  <text start="920.449" dur="6.37">they&amp;#39;re the ones who scooped up all of</text>
  <text start="923.19" dur="5.95">your data and compiled it on these super</text>
  <text start="926.819" dur="9.551">computers okay</text>
  <text start="929.14" dur="9.18">so I start to ask exactly the president</text>
  <text start="936.37" dur="3.839">is the one who has access to this</text>
  <text start="938.32" dur="3.57">information because the President and</text>
  <text start="940.209" dur="3.301">Mike Rogers well you know they probably</text>
  <text start="941.89" dur="4.77">have copied together once in a while</text>
  <text start="943.51" dur="6.389">unlike the president and Jeff Sessions</text>
  <text start="946.66" dur="5.64">who are not allowed to have coffee Mike</text>
  <text start="949.899" dur="3.63">Rogers NSA and Trump they can have</text>
  <text start="952.3" dur="3.51">coffee all they want and they can talk</text>
  <text start="953.529" dur="5">about stuff they can go into a skip and</text>
  <text start="955.81" dur="6.48">Mike Rogers can show Trump all kinds of</text>
  <text start="958.529" dur="5.441">classified raw data phone calls emails</text>
  <text start="962.29" dur="3.12">Rogers has the ability to do that if you</text>
  <text start="963.97" dur="4.049">did not see my scope</text>
  <text start="965.41" dur="3.869">yesterday I&amp;#39;m the day before I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="968.019" dur="2.961">through this I think this is a third</text>
  <text start="969.279" dur="5.041">scope in a day I&amp;#39;ve been talking about</text>
  <text start="970.98" dur="6.729">Mike Rogers the NSA the data and what</text>
  <text start="974.32" dur="5.13">are they doing with it okay and Pompeyo</text>
  <text start="977.709" dur="4.411">encourages it Pompeo came out and said</text>
  <text start="979.45" dur="4.4">you know what no one like Trump tweeting</text>
  <text start="982.12" dur="4.86">at first but we&amp;#39;re actually learning</text>
  <text start="983.85" dur="5.08">about our about other nations in their</text>
  <text start="986.98" dur="5.4">agendas by how they respond to Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="988.93" dur="7.74">tweets so Trump&amp;#39;s tweets are helping the</text>
  <text start="992.38" dur="7.44">CIA in a sense because Trump has the</text>
  <text start="996.67" dur="4.859">ability to get reactions from people and</text>
  <text start="999.82" dur="4.379">you can look at their reactions and</text>
  <text start="1001.529" dur="4.411">figure out what their allegiances are</text>
  <text start="1004.199" dur="4.971">what their belief systems are and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1005.94" dur="3.23">helpful for the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="1009.35" dur="9.87">so sunbeds let&amp;#39;s go yes the Sun Dance</text>
  <text start="1015.839" dur="6.301">scope this scope I&amp;#39;m going to focus on a</text>
  <text start="1019.22" dur="6.609">thread that was started by Thomas Victor</text>

  <text start="1040.679" dur="8.731">it so you&amp;#39;re gonna learn a little bit</text>
  <text start="1044.49" dur="6.33">about intelligence now here is I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1049.41" dur="2.55">gonna start off with something for you</text>

  <text start="1101.37" dur="4.89">not find out about it until the day</text>
  <text start="1103.38" dur="5.3">after Flynn signed his agreement with</text>
  <text start="1106.26" dur="2.42">the FBI</text>
  <text start="1109.46" dur="10.77">why the delay why was a fairly high</text>
  <text start="1115.35" dur="8.97">level guy in the FBI okay who</text>
  <text start="1120.23" dur="6.46">interviewed Flynn who interviewed Cheryl</text>
  <text start="1124.32" dur="3.95">Mills who interviewed a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1126.69" dur="6.51">players in the Clinton administration</text>
  <text start="1128.27" dur="8.91">who interviewed Hillary who had his</text>
  <text start="1133.2" dur="6.9">fingers in all of these things Strock</text>
  <text start="1137.18" dur="6.67">was the one who received the steel</text>
  <text start="1140.1" dur="6.99">dossier and potentially paid for it and</text>
  <text start="1143.85" dur="5.37">by the way the steel dossier let me talk</text>
  <text start="1147.09" dur="3.87">about that that&amp;#39;s a rabbit trail I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1149.22" dur="6.45">been looking at what George Webb has</text>
  <text start="1150.96" dur="8.01">been saying and learning about fusion</text>
  <text start="1155.67" dur="5.31">GPS is the which is the company that</text>
  <text start="1158.97" dur="4.17">came up with the steel dossier yeah this</text>
  <text start="1160.98" dur="4.41">is gonna be bonus information I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="1163.14" dur="3.78">you don&amp;#39;t even have to pay extra for and</text>
  <text start="1165.39" dur="4.71">if you don&amp;#39;t like it I&amp;#39;ll give you your</text>
  <text start="1166.92" dur="6.39">money back but George Webb has been</text>
  <text start="1170.1" dur="6.24">digging into fusion GPS and what they do</text>
  <text start="1173.31" dur="6.6">and and I&amp;#39;ve George believes and I think</text>
  <text start="1176.34" dur="9.6">he&amp;#39;s right that fusion GPS is actually</text>
  <text start="1179.91" dur="10.34">an FBI operation in the same way that</text>
  <text start="1185.94" dur="6.66">the CIA and the FBI have many operations</text>
  <text start="1190.25" dur="4.99">to do different things to accomplish</text>
  <text start="1192.6" dur="5.49">different goals I suspect</text>
  <text start="1195.24" dur="6.21">we&amp;#39;re going to learn that fusion GPS is</text>
  <text start="1198.09" dur="6.15">a FBI operation it isn&amp;#39;t it&amp;#39;s not an</text>
  <text start="1201.45" dur="5.13">in-house FBI operation they are like a</text>
  <text start="1204.24" dur="6.65">contractor a private contractor with the</text>
  <text start="1206.58" dur="9">FBI and what they do is they compile</text>
  <text start="1210.89" dur="9.779">dossiers on potential trouble causing</text>
  <text start="1215.58" dur="13.16">problematic people that the FBI needs to</text>
  <text start="1220.669" dur="13.931">neutralize or slander or incriminate and</text>
  <text start="1228.74" dur="8.95">I&amp;#39;ll give you an example so George Webb</text>
  <text start="1234.6" dur="4.47">has been digging into what Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="1237.69" dur="4.8">has been doing for the last couple of</text>
  <text start="1239.07" dur="6.3">years George Webb and Andrew McCabe had</text>
  <text start="1242.49" dur="5.309">a run in years ago on a case involving</text>
  <text start="1245.37" dur="6">this Muslim kid in Portland and ever</text>
  <text start="1247.799" dur="6.391">since then George Webb enander Makeda</text>
  <text start="1251.37" dur="6.659">that have been have had this problem</text>
  <text start="1254.19" dur="5.43">this difference of opinion and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1258.029" dur="3.741">know how Andrew McCabe feels about</text>
  <text start="1259.62" dur="5.1">George Webb that George Webb has been</text>
  <text start="1261.77" dur="7.81">investigating the FBI like crazy he has</text>
  <text start="1264.72" dur="12.209">a lawsuit against in them so George Webb</text>
  <text start="1269.58" dur="11.969">has theorized that fusion GPS has people</text>
  <text start="1276.929" dur="8.341">who compiled dirt compiled information</text>
  <text start="1281.549" dur="6">data names times dates where they live</text>
  <text start="1285.27" dur="4.139">who they had an affair with what they</text>
  <text start="1287.549" dur="3.901">were fired for all this information some</text>
  <text start="1289.409" dur="4.441">of it&amp;#39;s true some it&amp;#39;s not they compiled</text>
  <text start="1291.45" dur="5.55">a dossier on a lot of different people</text>
  <text start="1293.85" dur="7.079">and they hang on to that data and then</text>
  <text start="1297" dur="6.539">when the FBI needs it they have the</text>
  <text start="1300.929" dur="5.97">information available in a dossier they</text>
  <text start="1303.539" dur="6.981">give it to the FBI and the FBI uses it</text>
  <text start="1306.899" dur="9.03">in its case and there&amp;#39;s an interesting</text>
  <text start="1310.52" dur="9.629">okay let me go into Peter struck and and</text>
  <text start="1315.929" dur="8.341">his girlfriend Paige think her name is</text>
  <text start="1320.149" dur="6.88">they work very closely together they</text>
  <text start="1324.27" dur="4.74">both work under Andrew McCabe they are</text>
  <text start="1327.029" dur="3.811">in his little tiny inner circle and they</text>
  <text start="1329.01" dur="4.17">seemed to be involved in all of the</text>
  <text start="1330.84" dur="3.69">dirty work that mccabe has to do the</text>
  <text start="1333.18" dur="2.7">kate doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily want to get his</text>
  <text start="1334.53" dur="3.12">hands dirty he doesn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1335.88" dur="4.83">incriminate himself so he has other</text>
  <text start="1337.65" dur="5.64">people doing his dirty work and they</text>
  <text start="1340.71" dur="5.04">they are two of the people and they seem</text>
  <text start="1343.29" dur="4.47">to be joined at the hip when you when</text>
  <text start="1345.75" dur="4.86">George Webb has been following their</text>
  <text start="1347.76" dur="5.73">activities are always together so what</text>
  <text start="1350.61" dur="6.12">George Webb has theorized is this when</text>
  <text start="1353.49" dur="4.92">they go and they have to get some</text>
  <text start="1356.73" dur="4.32">information from someone or they have</text>
  <text start="1358.41" dur="6.32">their they&amp;#39;re working on a case they go</text>
  <text start="1361.05" dur="6.6">in and they interrogate people they will</text>
  <text start="1364.73" dur="5.86">go and get evidence they&amp;#39;ll go do</text>
  <text start="1367.65" dur="4.62">whatever they have to do they don&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="1370.59" dur="5.43">they don&amp;#39;t necessarily always get a</text>
  <text start="1372.27" dur="8.1">warrant in advance they go and do their</text>
  <text start="1376.02" dur="7.26">work they find out what they need to get</text>
  <text start="1380.37" dur="7.61">as far as the information goes and then</text>
  <text start="1383.28" dur="7.68">they go to a judge and get a warrant</text>
  <text start="1387.98" dur="6.4">retro actively dated before the event</text>
  <text start="1390.96" dur="5.31">and they use the dossier information</text>
  <text start="1394.38" dur="5.28">from a dossier that they get from Fusion</text>
  <text start="1396.27" dur="8.97">GPS to go to the judge who is probably</text>
  <text start="1399.66" dur="8.61">bribed they get a warrant post-dated are</text>
  <text start="1405.24" dur="4.44">predated and that covers their tracks so</text>
  <text start="1408.27" dur="5.34">that way when they go have to go to</text>
  <text start="1409.68" dur="6.9">court they have a warrant that is signed</text>
  <text start="1413.61" dur="4.35">by a judge before the fact although it</text>
  <text start="1416.58" dur="3.18">was actually signed after the fact and</text>
  <text start="1417.96" dur="4.8">they have information in the dossier</text>
  <text start="1419.76" dur="5.19">that supports the warrant and George</text>
  <text start="1422.76" dur="3.18">Webb theorizes this is an allegation and</text>
  <text start="1424.95" dur="3.45">we don&amp;#39;t know anything about this</text>
  <text start="1425.94" dur="6.6">whether it&amp;#39;s true or not but Webb</text>
  <text start="1428.4" dur="6.72">theorizes that fusion GPS is actually an</text>
  <text start="1432.54" dur="6">operation that does this for the FBI</text>
  <text start="1435.12" dur="6.54">that they create dossiers that they</text>
  <text start="1438.54" dur="5.43">create a database that agents can then</text>
  <text start="1441.66" dur="5.07">use to get warrants and to do whatever</text>
  <text start="1443.97" dur="6.18">they need to do so it&amp;#39;s an interesting</text>
  <text start="1446.73" dur="5.25">theory it&amp;#39;s an allegation I have no idea</text>
  <text start="1450.15" dur="3.99">if it&amp;#39;s true or not it but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1451.98" dur="3.51">interesting it wouldn&amp;#39;t knowing what</text>
  <text start="1454.14" dur="3.24">we&amp;#39;re fighting would is coming out about</text>
  <text start="1455.49" dur="6.27">the FBI it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me if that</text>
  <text start="1457.38" dur="5.48">was true it&amp;#39;s away from lazy agent to do</text>
  <text start="1461.76" dur="4.82">the things that</text>
  <text start="1462.86" dur="7.8">do and then get permission afterward is</text>
  <text start="1466.58" dur="7.77">it legal heck no it&amp;#39;s not legal and and</text>
  <text start="1470.66" dur="9.269">look look what is all the heartache</text>
  <text start="1474.35" dur="7.53">right now between the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="1479.929" dur="4.111">Committee did you diss your committee</text>
  <text start="1481.88" dur="6.51">and the FBI what is all the heartache</text>
  <text start="1484.04" dur="7.44">over it&amp;#39;s over fusion GPS the the DOJ</text>
  <text start="1488.39" dur="5.37">and the FBI do not want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1491.48" dur="3.63">fusion GPS they do not want to give</text>
  <text start="1493.76" dur="2.64">records they don&amp;#39;t want to give any</text>
  <text start="1495.11" dur="3.75">information they don&amp;#39;t want to talk</text>
  <text start="1496.4" dur="5.61">about it and they&amp;#39;re even risking being</text>
  <text start="1498.86" dur="4.8">held in contempt so that they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1502.01" dur="2.789">to give up that information if they do</text>
  <text start="1503.66" dur="4.5">not want to give up that information</text>
  <text start="1504.799" dur="5.851">about fusion GPS there is something very</text>
  <text start="1508.16" dur="6.69">very crooked going on with fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="1510.65" dur="9.029">and I suspect that George Webb is on to</text>
  <text start="1514.85" dur="6.6">something okay there&amp;#39;s a reason why they</text>
  <text start="1519.679" dur="10.441">don&amp;#39;t want anyone to know about fusion</text>
  <text start="1521.45" dur="10.8">GPS so it really is all about the</text>
  <text start="1530.12" dur="3.6">information it&amp;#39;s about who has the</text>
  <text start="1532.25" dur="7.14">information and what are they doing with</text>
  <text start="1533.72" dur="8.04">it so right fusion GPS has those</text>
  <text start="1539.39" dur="4.02">information and they can smear and they</text>
  <text start="1541.76" dur="3.15">can create scandals they can leak</text>
  <text start="1543.41" dur="2.639">information to which they have been</text>
  <text start="1544.91" dur="2.519">right</text>
  <text start="1546.049" dur="2.88">what was the steal dosti it was</text>
  <text start="1547.429" dur="4.291">information about Trump that was leaked</text>
  <text start="1548.929" dur="6.541">to the press and it was intended to</text>
  <text start="1551.72" dur="6.329">smear and defame the president and his</text>
  <text start="1555.47" dur="5.67">transition team that is what okay if the</text>
  <text start="1558.049" dur="5.611">FBI is doing this if the FBI is get</text>
  <text start="1561.14" dur="4.44">taking information paying a company to</text>
  <text start="1563.66" dur="3.509">compile this information and then they</text>
  <text start="1565.58" dur="3.54">can leak it out to the Washington Post</text>
  <text start="1567.169" dur="5.101">in New York Times so that they can smear</text>
  <text start="1569.12" dur="5.189">whoever they want to that is pretty</text>
  <text start="1572.27" dur="4.159">creepy nefarious activity and it looks</text>
  <text start="1574.309" dur="5.61">like that may be what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1576.429" dur="5.081">so yeah and a lot of it&amp;#39;s fake a lot of</text>
  <text start="1579.919" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s fake so much you have to put in</text>
  <text start="1581.51" dur="5.97">some truth in some error and people say</text>
  <text start="1585.679" dur="3.421">oh look this is true this is true are</text>
  <text start="1587.48" dur="4.71">the rest of it must be true and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1589.1" dur="4.65">it isn&amp;#39;t true so again just a theory</text>
  <text start="1592.19" dur="3.1">this is what George Webb thinks is going</text>
  <text start="1593.75" dur="9.559">on</text>
  <text start="1595.29" dur="11.259">so back to Muller&amp;#39;s team why if struck</text>

  <text start="1636.27" dur="5.35">don&amp;#39;t buy that I don&amp;#39;t buy that because</text>
  <text start="1640.36" dur="3">everyone knew they were Clinton</text>
  <text start="1641.62" dur="2.82">sympathizers why would you remove</text>

  <text start="1644.44" dur="4.979">they&amp;#39;re putting sympathizers that does</text>
  <text start="1647.049" dur="3.75">not make sense to me that doesn&amp;#39;t pass</text>
  <text start="1649.419" dur="3.211">the sniff test there&amp;#39;s something else</text>
  <text start="1650.799" dur="2.01">going on would you like to know what it</text>

  <text start="1652.809" dur="7.281">and you probably know this already all</text>
  <text start="1656.59" dur="4.89">right what would you say if I told you</text>
  <text start="1660.09" dur="4.69">that</text>
  <text start="1661.48" dur="5.13">Peter Strock was removed from Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1664.78" dur="5.81">team because he leaked classified</text>
  <text start="1666.61" dur="6.72">information about the mana fort</text>
  <text start="1670.59" dur="6.66">take down a man affords house to the</text>
  <text start="1673.33" dur="3.92">Washington Post before they did it</text>
  <text start="1678.179" dur="9.611">because that is what happened struck</text>
  <text start="1684" dur="6.25">leaked information the morning that they</text>
  <text start="1687.79" dur="3.9">renew the raid on metaphores house Drock</text>
  <text start="1690.25" dur="5.13">leaked that information to walk to the</text>
  <text start="1691.69" dur="8.4">waffle that is why he was removed from</text>
  <text start="1695.38" dur="7.049">Mulder&amp;#39;s team because he leaked</text>
  <text start="1700.09" dur="3.719">classified information there was</text>
  <text start="1702.429" dur="3.481">information in The Washington Post</text>
  <text start="1703.809" dur="8.071">article that was classified it was in a</text>
  <text start="1705.91" dur="8.61">sealed it was filled the that they were</text>
  <text start="1711.88" dur="4.44">gonna do the raid and somehow it got out</text>
  <text start="1714.52" dur="2.1">to waffle and struck was one who leaked</text>
  <text start="1716.32" dur="4.5">it</text>
  <text start="1716.62" dur="6.09">and I would imagine that&amp;#39;s really why he</text>
  <text start="1720.82" dur="5.489">was removed from Wohlers team because he</text>
  <text start="1722.71" dur="5.06">was a licker which now goes on to ask</text>
  <text start="1726.309" dur="6.601">the question</text>
  <text start="1727.77" dur="8.8">why is mmm Muller&amp;#39;s team leaks out</text>
  <text start="1732.91" dur="6.41">information about metaphors indictment</text>
  <text start="1736.57" dur="7.56">the Friday before he appears in court</text>
  <text start="1739.32" dur="6.16">and that&amp;#39;s okay but when they leak out</text>
  <text start="1744.13" dur="3.33">the information about the fact that</text>
  <text start="1745.48" dur="4.65">they&amp;#39;re going to break into or not break</text>
  <text start="1747.46" dur="5.25">in but do a search and seizure in his</text>
  <text start="1750.13" dur="4.92">house and that is leaked one of the team</text>
  <text start="1752.71" dur="4.08">members is booted apparently some</text>
  <text start="1755.05" dur="4.17">linking is okay and some leaking isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1756.79" dur="4.89">unless there was retribution or</text>
  <text start="1759.22" dur="5.19">punishment for the leaker who leaked the</text>
  <text start="1761.68" dur="8.18">grand jury information and we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1764.41" dur="11.55">that but it it is all about the leaking</text>
  <text start="1769.86" dur="12.79">hang on I&amp;#39;m gonna play a clip for you to</text>
  <text start="1775.96" dur="14.82">get this going listen up someone you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1782.65" dur="13.17">remember frankly speaking the people on</text>
  <text start="1790.78" dur="7.26">the hill frankly speaking the people on</text>
  <text start="1795.82" dur="4.32">the hill it was more actually aimed</text>
  <text start="1798.04" dur="3.75">aimed at telling the hill people get as</text>
  <text start="1800.14" dur="3.18">much as the information as you can get</text>
  <text start="1801.79" dur="2.97">as much intelligence as you can before</text>
  <text start="1803.32" dur="3.9">President Obama leaves the</text>
  <text start="1804.76" dur="4.29">administration because I had a fear that</text>
  <text start="1807.22" dur="4.35">somehow that information would disappear</text>
  <text start="1809.05" dur="4.67">with the senior people who left so it</text>
  <text start="1811.57" dur="5.52">would be hidden away in the bureaucracy</text>
  <text start="1813.72" dur="7.36">that the Trump folks if they found out</text>
  <text start="1817.09" dur="6.03">how we knew what we knew remembers the</text>
  <text start="1821.08" dur="3.78">staff the Trump staffs dealing with</text>
  <text start="1823.12" dur="3.48">Russians that they would try to</text>
  <text start="1824.86" dur="3.63">compromise those sources and methods</text>
  <text start="1826.6" dur="4.26">meaning we would no longer have access</text>
  <text start="1828.49" dur="4.65">to that intelligence so I became very</text>
  <text start="1830.86" dur="3.93">worried because not enough was coming</text>
  <text start="1833.14" dur="3.63">out into the open and I knew that there</text>
  <text start="1834.79" dur="4.83">was more we have very good intelligence</text>
  <text start="1836.77" dur="4.29">on Russia so then I had talked to</text>
  <text start="1839.62" dur="3.12">something like former colleagues and I</text>
  <text start="1841.06" dur="4.68">knew that they were trying to also help</text>
  <text start="1842.74" dur="5.04">get information to the hill a lot going</text>
  <text start="1845.74" dur="6.44">on today yeah that&amp;#39;s why you of the</text>
  <text start="1847.78" dur="6.24">leaking that&amp;#39;s why you have the leaking</text>
  <text start="1852.18" dur="5.32">because the people in the Obama</text>
  <text start="1854.02" dur="5.18">administration wanted all this</text>
  <text start="1857.5" dur="3.75">information to get out to the press</text>
  <text start="1859.2" dur="4.09">because they knew and trumped</text>
  <text start="1861.25" dur="5.04">/ that information might not be</text>
  <text start="1863.29" dur="8.55">available anymore from the beginning it</text>
  <text start="1866.29" dur="8.4">has all been about the leaking the</text>
  <text start="1871.84" dur="5.07">unmasking everything it&amp;#39;s all about the</text>
  <text start="1874.69" dur="6.18">linking and it&amp;#39;s interesting because</text>
  <text start="1876.91" dur="8.15">these two different sides are playing</text>
  <text start="1880.87" dur="6.69">two different games the Obama</text>
  <text start="1885.06" dur="5.95">administration and their supporters in</text>
  <text start="1887.56" dur="6.06">the press are playing the game</text>
  <text start="1891.01" dur="7.91">let&amp;#39;s leak all the dirt we can about</text>
  <text start="1893.62" dur="9.54">Trump and his team Trump and Flynn and</text>
  <text start="1898.92" dur="6.51">McMaster and and everyone on Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1903.16" dur="5.34">team they have taken a different course</text>
  <text start="1905.43" dur="8.05">they are all about finding the leakers</text>
  <text start="1908.5" dur="6.6">and prosecuting them and so this is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1913.48" dur="8.43">gonna transition here in just a second</text>
  <text start="1915.1" dur="9">we&amp;#39;re going toward the leakers so it is</text>
  <text start="1921.91" dur="6.57">but it is interesting as Thomas winter</text>
  <text start="1924.1" dur="9.33">notes the information being leaked to</text>
  <text start="1928.48" dur="5.46">the press by people inside the deep</text>
  <text start="1933.43" dur="3.24">State</text>
  <text start="1933.94" dur="7.56">so Defense Department State Department</text>
  <text start="1936.67" dur="6.93">of National Security Council CIA right</text>
  <text start="1941.5" dur="6.18">the information being leaked to the</text>
  <text start="1943.6" dur="6.57">press is not raw intelligence it is</text>
  <text start="1947.68" dur="4.98">reports so the two kinds of intelligence</text>
  <text start="1950.17" dur="6.68">there&amp;#39;s raw intelligence phone calls</text>
  <text start="1952.66" dur="6.48">text messages emails there is processed</text>

  <text start="1959.14" dur="5.43">everything that&amp;#39;s going out to the press</text>
  <text start="1960.97" dur="7.74">is reports it is wicker finds it very</text>
  <text start="1964.57" dur="6.99">interesting that unlike Bush who got</text>
  <text start="1968.71" dur="4.74">hammered by many different countries and</text>
  <text start="1971.56" dur="4.59">different places because he was always</text>

  <text start="1991.36" dur="7.79">going to Trump&amp;#39;s enemies and Victor says</text>
  <text start="1994.78" dur="7.83">that that&amp;#39;s because Mike Rogers and</text>

  <text start="3207.109" dur="7.631">columns and I&amp;#39;ll play this clip for you</text>
  <text start="3210.69" dur="6.629">here there was a lot of controversy when</text>
  <text start="3214.74" dur="5.19">Trump visited the CIA because because</text>
  <text start="3217.319" dur="5.01">the perception in his ta was Trump was</text>
  <text start="3219.93" dur="5.639">hostile to the CIA to the intelligence</text>
  <text start="3222.329" dur="5.28">community and so he goes into Langley</text>
  <text start="3225.569" dur="7.74">and he goes into the CIA building right</text>
  <text start="3227.609" dur="9">and all right he talked about columns</text>
  <text start="3233.309" dur="7.201">the and for those of you don&amp;#39;t know the</text>
  <text start="3236.609" dur="6.541">fifth column is a is any group of people</text>

  <text start="3245.609" dur="4.411">group or nation so the fifth column is</text>
  <text start="3248.43" dur="3.21">always considered to be kind of a</text>
  <text start="3250.02" dur="4.86">nefarious group of people who are</text>
  <text start="3251.64" dur="8.64">undermining the group the larger groups</text>
  <text start="3254.88" dur="7.35">goal and the CIA was kind of perceived</text>

  <text start="3262.23" dur="5.25">community that was had the goal of</text>
  <text start="3264.18" dur="5.189">undermining the Trump administration so</text>
  <text start="3267.48" dur="7.859">Trump goes into Langley into the CIA</text>
  <text start="3269.369" dur="9.151">headquarters and this is what he says</text>
  <text start="3275.339" dur="4.71">and he takes Flynn with him now it&amp;#39;s not</text>

  <text start="3723.87" dur="7.02">he changes his story slightly all right</text>
  <text start="3727.109" dur="6.811">On February 13 four days later Glenn</text>

  <text start="3733.92" dur="5.129">pence in the FBI okay but the damage has</text>
  <text start="3738.39" dur="3.54">been done</text>
  <text start="3739.049" dur="4.921">because when already has his people on</text>

  <text start="3761.579" dur="4.23">stage right</text>
  <text start="3762.299" dur="5.581">so he resigns and the people who have</text>

  <text start="3767.88" dur="4.469">they have them for 12 months you have to</text>

  <text start="3776.64" dur="8.159">people who were asking so why is this</text>
  <text start="3780.63" dur="8.52">timeline important because January by</text>
  <text start="3784.799" dur="9.931">January 24th we know that Flynn knew</text>
  <text start="3789.15" dur="7.879">three things for certain he knew his</text>

  <text start="3814.759" dur="7.3">by members of the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="3818.269" dur="5.77">okay now it&amp;#39;s entirely possible Flynn</text>
  <text start="3822.059" dur="4.53">knowingly lied to the FBI about</text>
  <text start="3824.039" dur="5.28">something he knew that they already knew</text>
  <text start="3826.589" dur="5.101">was a lie because he didn&amp;#39;t trust the</text>

  <text start="3831.69" dur="3.889">possibility but there&amp;#39;s another</text>

  <text start="3839.099" dur="6.6">had he answered yes and the FBI leaked</text>
  <text start="3842.579" dur="5.73">it in the environment at that time which</text>
  <text start="3845.699" dur="4.62">is even worse than it was now the news</text>
  <text start="3848.309" dur="3.96">would have sunk Trump&amp;#39;s administration</text>
  <text start="3850.319" dur="3.69">in a Russian scandal to the point they</text>
  <text start="3852.269" dur="4.5">may have not had been able to recover</text>

  <text start="3863.64" dur="5.129">honestly about a conversation he knew</text>
  <text start="3865.739" dur="3.87">was in no way illegal or treasonous with</text>
  <text start="3868.769" dur="3">that in mind</text>
  <text start="3869.609" dur="4.291">Flynn being a patriot fell on a sword to</text>
  <text start="3871.769" dur="4.44">protect the administration from an undue</text>
  <text start="3873.9" dur="5.309">and unfair scrutiny he protected pence</text>
  <text start="3876.209" dur="4.83">and so he basically says yeah I lied</text>
  <text start="3879.209" dur="3.6">about the stuff and he can you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3881.039" dur="5.07">have to lie but he he knew that if he</text>

  <text start="3886.109" dur="6.93">FBI leaked it Pence and Trump both end</text>
  <text start="3891.509" dur="4.31">up with a egg on their face and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3893.039" dur="5.22">a big scandal and it gets much worse so</text>
  <text start="3895.819" dur="4.361">Flynn lies doesn&amp;#39;t tell the FBI what</text>
  <text start="3898.259" dur="3.181">actually happened falls on the sword and</text>
  <text start="3900.18" dur="7.109">then he exits but he&amp;#39;s already got his</text>

  <text start="4453.409" dur="2.601">right now</text>

  <text start="4495.29" dur="4.02">disclosure of the defendants appearance</text>

  <text start="4501.409" dur="3.211">cooperator I mean let me translate that</text>
  <text start="4504.02" dur="5.13">for you</text>
  <text start="4504.62" dur="8.22">Muller was arguing that if the public</text>
  <text start="4509.15" dur="5.73">knew that Papadopoulos had been indicted</text>
  <text start="4512.84" dur="3.359">and was cooperating with Mulder&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4514.88" dur="4.739">investigation it</text>
  <text start="4516.199" dur="6.3">hampered Papadopoulos from giving them</text>
  <text start="4519.619" dur="5.641">information because Papadopoulos flipped</text>
  <text start="4522.499" dur="6.24">he replied to a nothing charge of lying</text>
  <text start="4525.26" dur="8.27">to the FBI because he was giving them</text>
  <text start="4528.739" dur="7.47">information Papadopoulos wasn&amp;#39;t formally</text>
  <text start="4533.53" dur="5.23">indicted until october because they did</text>
  <text start="4536.209" dur="4.5">not want to expose the world that he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="4538.76" dur="4.35">been caught up in and ruined his ability</text>
  <text start="4540.709" dur="5.611">to gather more intelligence for the</text>
  <text start="4543.11" dur="5.609">investigation so why didn&amp;#39;t the news of</text>
  <text start="4546.32" dur="5.399">struts reassignment leak until after</text>
  <text start="4548.719" dur="6.541">Flynn signed his plea could it be</text>
  <text start="4551.719" dur="5.57">because Strock texts were given to</text>
  <text start="4555.26" dur="4.35">Muller by Flynn&amp;#39;s leaked hunters and</text>
  <text start="4557.289" dur="5.68">announcing that they had them in July</text>
  <text start="4559.61" dur="7.619">would have cut exposed Flynn&amp;#39;s network</text>
  <text start="4562.969" dur="6.57">and network run by men like capper if</text>
  <text start="4567.229" dur="5.191">that&amp;#39;s it it is possible and he says if</text>
  <text start="4569.539" dur="3.631">it&amp;#39;s true now that Flynn has come in</text>
  <text start="4572.42" dur="3.69">from the cold</text>
  <text start="4573.17" dur="6.599">it could mean that struck is just the</text>
  <text start="4576.11" dur="6.719">beginning that we&amp;#39;re perhaps about to</text>
  <text start="4579.769" dur="5.7">see the results of plums Network being</text>
  <text start="4582.829" dur="4.611">deployed before he resigned so let me</text>
  <text start="4585.469" dur="9.44">break that down for you and translate</text>
  <text start="4587.44" dur="7.469">what he&amp;#39;s saying is if Papadopoulos and</text>
  <text start="4595.449" dur="9.61">metaphor and Flynn and Strock we&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="4602.389" dur="6.6">caught up in things earlier in the year</text>
  <text start="4605.059" dur="9.591">and we&amp;#39;re only hearing about them now it</text>
  <text start="4608.989" dur="10.201">is likely that Flynn&amp;#39;s work and</text>
  <text start="4614.65" dur="7.63">Papadopoulos work and stocks work in</text>
  <text start="4619.19" dur="4.5">cooperating and helping Muller stir all</text>
  <text start="4622.28" dur="3.39">the stuff out that&amp;#39;s coming to an end</text>
  <text start="4623.69" dur="7.139">and the reason why Flynn signed the plea</text>
  <text start="4625.67" dur="8.75">deal this last week is that now that the</text>
  <text start="4630.829" dur="8.25">work and the investigation and the</text>
  <text start="4634.42" dur="6.819">interrogation of witnesses is over now</text>
  <text start="4639.079" dur="5.761">it&amp;#39;s time to let people know that Flynn</text>
  <text start="4641.239" dur="5.76">is copping to a plea and that Strock has</text>
  <text start="4644.84" dur="4.049">been reassigned and that all these other</text>
  <text start="4646.999" dur="2.821">people are going are there we&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="4648.889" dur="3.811">a determination on them</text>
  <text start="4649.82" dur="5.94">because the investigative work has</text>
  <text start="4652.7" dur="5.16">already been done and now making this</text>
  <text start="4655.76" dur="6.05">information public isn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="4657.86" dur="7.46">compromise the investigation just like</text>
  <text start="4661.81" dur="5.92">interesting okay so the OIG Inspector</text>
  <text start="4665.32" dur="6.55">Office of Inspector General Partner of</text>
  <text start="4667.73" dur="6.45">Justice on December 2nd issued a</text>
  <text start="4671.87" dur="6.23">statement saying that they will be</text>
  <text start="4674.18" dur="7.77">coming forth with the determination of</text>
  <text start="4678.1" dur="7">their investigation of Comey Andrew</text>
  <text start="4681.95" dur="4.8">McCabe and all these other people in the</text>
  <text start="4685.1" dur="6.57">FBI who have been under investigation</text>
  <text start="4686.75" dur="7.38">this whole year December 2nd the Office</text>
  <text start="4691.67" dur="4.49">of Inspector General suddenly throws out</text>
  <text start="4694.13" dur="5.22">this announcement that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="4696.16" dur="6.61">bring out the findings why would they do</text>
  <text start="4699.35" dur="6.42">that unless sir unless the investigation</text>
  <text start="4702.77" dur="8.25">had concluded why would we learn about</text>
  <text start="4705.77" dur="6.75">struck by would plan Flynn plea and all</text>
  <text start="4711.02" dur="3.3">of this is happening the first week of</text>
  <text start="4712.52" dur="3.72">December unless all of that stuff is</text>
  <text start="4714.32" dur="3.93">already done investigations done</text>
  <text start="4716.24" dur="3.66">witnesses have testified they&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="4718.25" dur="6.87">their interrogations and they&amp;#39;re ready</text>
  <text start="4719.9" dur="7.58">to wrap it all up so the to me what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4725.12" dur="6.36">seeing here if I&amp;#39;m looking at this</text>
  <text start="4727.48" dur="6.7">critically objectively is it looks to me</text>
  <text start="4731.48" dur="5.52">like a lot of these players have already</text>
  <text start="4734.18" dur="4.53">cooperated they&amp;#39;ve testified and now</text>
  <text start="4737" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re playing and now we&amp;#39;re learning</text>
  <text start="4738.71" dur="5.61">about what&amp;#39;s going on so I think in the</text>
  <text start="4742.58" dur="5.28">next few weeks we&amp;#39;re gonna learn a lot</text>
  <text start="4744.32" dur="6.54">more let me go down through his thread</text>
  <text start="4747.86" dur="5.13">and see if there&amp;#39;s anything else this</text>
  <text start="4750.86" dur="4.83">might explain the timing of Strock</text>
  <text start="4752.99" dur="6.47">revelation he probably flipped on others</text>
  <text start="4755.69" dur="6.09">inside the FBI who were also corrupt and</text>
  <text start="4759.46" dur="4.18">it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me to find out that</text>
  <text start="4761.78" dur="4.68">Flynn&amp;#39;s network had something to do with</text>
  <text start="4763.64" dur="4.86">it because Flynn has all these people</text>
  <text start="4766.46" dur="3.12">right and they all have high clearance</text>
  <text start="4768.5" dur="4.97">and they&amp;#39;re all getting text messages</text>
  <text start="4769.58" dur="7.38">and emails like I said in the last goat</text>
  <text start="4773.47" dur="4.99">Rodgers has everybody&amp;#39;s emails text</text>
  <text start="4776.96" dur="3.81">messages and phone calls and he can give</text>
  <text start="4778.46" dur="3.42">it to anybody who has a need to know and</text>
  <text start="4780.77" dur="4.32">the security clearance</text>
  <text start="4781.88" dur="4.62">and they all the need to know is simply</text>
  <text start="4785.09" dur="3.51">you&amp;#39;re part of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="4786.5" dur="4.679">community you&amp;#39;re trying to rat out these</text>
  <text start="4788.6" dur="3.599">leakers and they security clearance when</text>
  <text start="4791.179" dur="8.431">make sure that they got the security</text>
  <text start="4792.199" dur="10.111">clearance they needed oh and the light</text>
  <text start="4799.61" dur="6.14">that red felt actually puts in a link to</text>
  <text start="4802.31" dur="7.71">the Office of Inspector General notice</text>
  <text start="4805.75" dur="5.92">saying that after 11 months of</text>
  <text start="4810.02" dur="4.139">investigation they&amp;#39;re about to announce</text>
  <text start="4811.67" dur="7.35">their findings and that at the end of</text>
  <text start="4814.159" dur="5.52">the thread so I hope you found this</text>
  <text start="4819.02" dur="4.59">helpful</text>
  <text start="4819.679" dur="6.421">and I hope that when you read these news</text>
  <text start="4823.61" dur="4.77">articles in the future you see these</text>
  <text start="4826.1" dur="3.9">leaked information coming out and</text>
  <text start="4828.38" dur="4.62">Washington Post in New York Times and</text>
  <text start="4830" dur="6.449">all these other places consider the fact</text>
  <text start="4833" dur="5.699">that although people who are leaking the</text>
  <text start="4836.449" dur="6.261">information think they&amp;#39;re getting the</text>

  <text start="4842.71" dur="5.59">helping out their team most of them many</text>

  <text start="4848.3" dur="4.589">going to get prosecuted and so I always</text>
  <text start="4850.76" dur="4.53">look at where did the information come</text>
  <text start="4852.889" dur="4.621">from where did they you know who leaked</text>
  <text start="4855.29" dur="3.9">it what&amp;#39;s their agenda and what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4857.51" dur="3.689">going to happen to that leaker because</text>
  <text start="4859.19" dur="3.33">if you think that these leakers are just</text>
  <text start="4861.199" dur="3.841">getting away with all that stuff</text>
  <text start="4862.52" dur="4.949">I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re I think Trump has</text>
