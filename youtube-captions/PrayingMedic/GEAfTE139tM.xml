  <text start="508.4" dur="6.939">hit Co me by surprise he did not expect</text>
  <text start="511.289" dur="7.231">that question without using his name</text>
  <text start="515.339" dur="4.911">James Comey said it was because the head</text>
  <text start="518.52" dur="7.68">of the counterintelligence division</text>
  <text start="520.25" dur="9.68">Belpre staff told him not to advise the</text>
  <text start="526.2" dur="8.12">intelligence Oversight people</text>
  <text start="529.93" dur="6.4">right oversight protocol requires the</text>
  <text start="534.32" dur="4.85">FBI director to tell congressional</text>

  <text start="541.46" dur="3.84">required to report on it</text>
  <text start="542.72" dur="4.35">in fact this gal who asked this question</text>
  <text start="545.3" dur="4.38">said when do you normally report on</text>
  <text start="547.07" dur="4.02">these operations said well we do</text>
  <text start="549.68" dur="3.27">quarterly reports and then we do other</text>
  <text start="551.09" dur="3.18">reports and if we have a kind of</text>
  <text start="552.95" dur="3.09">intelligence operation we would give</text>
  <text start="554.27" dur="3.78">information to House Oversight on that</text>
  <text start="556.04" dur="3.75">and then the gal asked why didn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="558.05" dur="7.5">tell congressional oversight</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="6.98">he was like because the head of</text>

  <text start="1228.57" dur="3.99">the other people in the in the gang of</text>

  <text start="1232.56" dur="8.16">piece it all together individually okay</text>
  <text start="1235.86" dur="7.47">this is why Devin Nunez who is a gang of</text>
  <text start="1240.72" dur="7.38">eight member had to request why he has</text>
  <text start="1243.33" dur="9.63">to request intelligence from each</text>
  <text start="1248.1" dur="6.51">department NSA DOJ FBI in order to share</text>

  <text start="1254.61" dur="8.7">he is the chair Nunez can review the</text>
  <text start="1258" dur="7.59">executive skiff products he can Nunez</text>
  <text start="1263.31" dur="4.38">because he&amp;#39;s a chair that house Intel he</text>
  <text start="1265.59" dur="3.69">can go to the presidential ticket he can</text>
  <text start="1267.69" dur="3.57">look at the presidential daily briefing</text>
  <text start="1269.28" dur="4.47">he can&amp;#39;t share with anyone he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1271.26" dur="4.44">share with his committee if he sees</text>
  <text start="1273.75" dur="4.14">anything in the presidential daily</text>
  <text start="1275.7" dur="4.56">briefing that gives him concerned he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="1277.89" dur="4.23">have to go to the agency that gave that</text>
  <text start="1280.26" dur="3.84">particular information and get it from</text>
  <text start="1282.12" dur="3.6">them and get it from all of them pull it</text>
  <text start="1284.1" dur="5.42">together and then he could share it with</text>
  <text start="1285.72" dur="5.64">his committee so this is what</text>
  <text start="1289.52" dur="5.11">compartmentalization of intelligence</text>
  <text start="1291.36" dur="10.37">does it makes it very hard to get access</text>
  <text start="1294.63" dur="9.57">to information the congressionals gift</text>
  <text start="1301.73" dur="4.99">holds the compartment and information</text>
  <text start="1304.2" dur="4.68">for committee members to review the</text>
  <text start="1306.72" dur="3.96">intelligence is then removed or deleted</text>
  <text start="1308.88" dur="9.87">after committee members have looked at</text>
  <text start="1310.68" dur="12.35">it Sundance&amp;#39;s research suggests that in</text>
  <text start="1318.75" dur="7.32">February and March of 2017</text>
  <text start="1323.03" dur="5.5">Devin Nunez the gang of eight member</text>

  <text start="1340.05" dur="8.58">skip the intelligence would have been</text>
  <text start="1344.76" dur="7.59">delivered to that gift for his review</text>
  <text start="1348.63" dur="7.44">most likely by either Director of</text>

  <text start="1356.07" dur="5.46">had mike rogers one of those two people</text>
  <text start="1358.71" dur="5.1">probably assembled that presidential</text>

  <text start="1363.81" dur="3.72">the skip in the united as an hour</text>
  <text start="1365.25" dur="5.61">building and then unions went there and</text>
  <text start="1367.53" dur="5.16">looked at it computed that is what</text>
  <text start="1370.86" dur="3.45">sundance is kind of putting pieces</text>
  <text start="1372.69" dur="8.73">together this is kind of what it looks</text>
  <text start="1374.31" dur="11.7">like after Nunez reviewed the</text>
  <text start="1381.42" dur="6.6">information March 22nd 2017 he held a</text>

  <text start="2211.95" dur="5.07">said it was in July of 2016</text>
  <text start="2214.11" dur="4.26">Comey has already admitted that the</text>
  <text start="2217.02" dur="2.43">problem is they didn&amp;#39;t have a warrant</text>
  <text start="2218.37" dur="5.66">for any of that information until</text>
  <text start="2219.45" dur="9.42">October and that&amp;#39;s all on public record</text>
  <text start="2224.03" dur="7.39">it&amp;#39;s not even in question on November</text>

  <text start="2277.95" dur="5.73">likely that Rogers went there to tell</text>
  <text start="2280.92" dur="4.26">them look I got some bad news for you</text>
  <text start="2283.68" dur="4.14">you guys have been under surveillance by</text>
  <text start="2285.18" dur="3.36">the FBI for a long time Obama knows all</text>

  <text start="2306.57" dur="6.06">trump National Golf Course in Bedminster</text>
  <text start="2309.42" dur="5.19">New Jersey where they interviewed and</text>
  <text start="2312.63" dur="4.02">discussed the most sensitive positions</text>
  <text start="2314.61" dur="5.13">they needed to fill Department of</text>
  <text start="2316.65" dur="5.55">Defense CIA State Department Director of</text>
  <text start="2319.74" dur="4.47">National Intelligence since they knew</text>

  <text start="2327.81" dur="5.07">transition team dumped some people who</text>
  <text start="2330.27" dur="5.27">Rogers probably told them were not good</text>
  <text start="2332.88" dur="2.66">people to have around</text>
  <text start="2336.35" dur="6.64">it appears that clapper among others is</text>
  <text start="2340.4" dur="5.2">up to his eyeballs in all of this</text>
  <text start="2342.99" dur="5.97">although he has denied participation in</text>
  <text start="2345.6" dur="8.37">this the FBI counterintelligence unit</text>
  <text start="2348.96" dur="9.18">and the Department of Justice nasha</text>

  <text start="2362.46" dur="7.53">gather surveillance without oversight</text>
  <text start="2365.87" dur="7.66">that&amp;#39;s what this comes down to FBI and</text>
  <text start="2369.99" dur="5.94">DOJ really wanted to surveil whoever</text>
  <text start="2373.53" dur="6.77">they wanted to and not be accountable to</text>
  <text start="2375.93" dur="4.37">the people and to anyone for oversight</text>
  <text start="2380.93" dur="6.61">the Trump team members who were found in</text>
  <text start="2384.51" dur="5.79">the FBI intercepts is what Devin Nunez</text>
  <text start="2387.54" dur="3.63">likely discovered when he looked at the</text>

  <text start="2391.17" dur="5.909">requests in that Eisenhower building</text>
  <text start="2393.27" dur="7.039">skip and March that is why he&amp;#39;s pushing</text>
  <text start="2397.079" dur="6.451">so hard to get the FBI and the DOJ</text>
  <text start="2400.309" dur="4.721">people under oath to get the documents</text>
  <text start="2403.53" dur="6.029">you&amp;#39;ve seen this over the last two weeks</text>
