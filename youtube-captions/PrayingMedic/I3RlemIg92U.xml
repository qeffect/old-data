  <text start="92.579" dur="5.911">believe you said that</text>
  <text start="93.6" dur="8.58">I can&amp;#39;t believe she said that</text>
  <text start="98.49" dur="8.489">look I remember last year when we got</text>
  <text start="102.18" dur="7.5">the IG report on the FBI&amp;#39;s handling of</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="5.911">the Hillary Clinton email investigation</text>
  <text start="109.68" dur="5.579">and we had first started hearing rumors</text>
  <text start="112.89" dur="4.89">that it was going to come out in April</text>
  <text start="115.259" dur="4.171">and May of last year and people were</text>

  <text start="124.74" dur="5.4">of weeks didn&amp;#39;t come out it was a good</text>
  <text start="127.86" dur="4.379">two months after they had said it was</text>
  <text start="130.14" dur="3">gonna come out that we finally saw last</text>
  <text start="132.239" dur="5.431">year&amp;#39;s ID</text>
  <text start="133.14" dur="6.66">report so based on that I have been</text>
  <text start="137.67" dur="5.31">keeping my powder dry on expectations</text>
  <text start="139.8" dur="4.88">about seeing this report because every</text>
  <text start="142.98" dur="4.32">time someone says it&amp;#39;s going to come out</text>
  <text start="144.68" dur="4.72">on such-and-such a date it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="5.1">happen and that&amp;#39;s just how the</text>
  <text start="149.4" dur="6.6">department justice works it is a slow</text>
  <text start="152.4" dur="7.74">laborious bureaucracy where things seem</text>
  <text start="156" dur="6.03">to take forever and we got a little</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="5.099">taste of this again this year when the</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="5.49">Comey report came out Joe did Geneva</text>
  <text start="165.239" dur="3.661">went on the air and said Oh in a couple</text>
  <text start="167.52" dur="4.56">of weeks he was gonna be at Great</text>
  <text start="168.9" dur="4.47">Portland James Comey and everyone was</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="3.72">waiting for that reports that come out a</text>
  <text start="173.37" dur="5.369">couple of weeks didn&amp;#39;t happen I think it</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="4.95">was six weeks after did Jen of us said</text>
  <text start="178.739" dur="5.731">that report was gonna be out that it</text>
  <text start="180.75" dur="6.3">finally dropped and Joey did Jennifer</text>
  <text start="184.47" dur="4.2">got a lot of crap for telling people</text>
  <text start="187.05" dur="3.36">this report was going to come out and</text>
  <text start="188.67" dur="6.539">then it didn&amp;#39;t come out for six weeks</text>
  <text start="190.41" dur="7.829">later so we have been hearing that the</text>
  <text start="195.209" dur="4.971">IG report on FISA abuse was I think the</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="3.961">first time people started reporting me</text>
  <text start="200.18" dur="5.08">we&amp;#39;re expecting it to come out with an</text>
  <text start="202.2" dur="4.349">actually an April of this year and in</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="3.84">May we were hearing it&amp;#39;s going to come</text>
  <text start="206.549" dur="4.111">out and June it was supposed to come out</text>
  <text start="209.1" dur="2.82">and then they said oh wait a minute they</text>
  <text start="210.66" dur="3.87">had to go an interview Christopher</text>
  <text start="211.92" dur="4.5">Steele and I had to fly to the UK and</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="3.09">they interviewed him for two days and</text>
  <text start="216.42" dur="4.53">they flew back and then they had to</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="4.95">reinterviews air testimony changed based</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="3.599">on what Christopher steel had said and</text>
  <text start="222.57" dur="5.16">then that delayed the whole thing for</text>
  <text start="224.549" dur="5.341">like another month or two so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="227.73" dur="4.65">been delay delay delay delay and when</text>
  <text start="229.89" dur="5.129">Maria Bartiromo got on to her show last</text>
  <text start="232.38" dur="5.73">week and said oh yeah it&amp;#39;s coming out of</text>
  <text start="235.019" dur="6.301">the 18th I was like no it&amp;#39;s not I told</text>
  <text start="238.11" dur="5.61">the bees yesterday morning I said you</text>
  <text start="241.32" dur="4.38">know I&amp;#39;m I really hope people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="3.72">getting your expectations up and their</text>
  <text start="245.7" dur="3.15">hopes up on this report coming out on</text>
  <text start="247.44" dur="4.53">the 18th because I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="248.85" dur="5.009">going to as soon as someone picks a date</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="4.139">you can just write that on the calendar</text>
  <text start="253.859" dur="4.321">as a date it&amp;#39;s not going to happen so</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="4.291">you know yesterday afternoon and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="258.18" dur="3.779">like okay yeah well I got word that the</text>
  <text start="260.4" dur="3.21">IG reports not going to be out on the</text>
  <text start="261.959" dur="4.171">18th this kind of look for it at the end</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="3.48">of the month and I was like yeah we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="266.13" dur="3.81">be lucky to see it</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="6.66">sometime in November probably all right</text>
  <text start="269.94" dur="7.44">so I just want to give people just kind</text>
  <text start="273.75" dur="8.37">of a general encouragement don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="277.38" dur="6.99">be just just kind of a warning manage</text>
  <text start="282.12" dur="3.66">your expectations don&amp;#39;t expect that when</text>
  <text start="284.37" dur="2.91">someone says the reports going to come</text>
  <text start="285.78" dur="4.05">out from the Department of Justice on</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="3.15">such-and-such a date take it with a</text>
  <text start="289.83" dur="3.63">grain of salt</text>
  <text start="290.43" dur="6.48">because the Department of Justice and</text>
  <text start="293.46" dur="5.52">the FBI move very slowly and they they</text>
  <text start="296.91" dur="5.46">only have one chance to do this and they</text>
  <text start="298.98" dur="6.15">have to do it right and and the other</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="4.59">thing that that I found interesting is</text>
  <text start="305.13" dur="4.77">we know if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re a cue</text>
  <text start="306.96" dur="5.25">follower you know that Q has given us an</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="5.79">order of operation of how these things</text>
  <text start="312.21" dur="6.709">are going to progress the reason why we</text>
  <text start="315.69" dur="7.86">haven&amp;#39;t seen anyone any of the big names</text>
  <text start="318.919" dur="7.75">prosecuted arrested indicted so far</text>
  <text start="323.55" dur="6.48">although there are 124 thousand sealed</text>
  <text start="326.669" dur="5.071">cases on the pacer gov website you can</text>
  <text start="330.03" dur="3.36">just imagine who might be indicted</text>
  <text start="331.74" dur="6.21">there&amp;#39;s a hundred and twenty four</text>
  <text start="333.39" dur="8.88">thousand cases of sealed cases on the in</text>
  <text start="337.95" dur="5.7">the federal court dockets so the reason</text>
  <text start="342.27" dur="5.1">we haven&amp;#39;t seen any arrests yet</text>
  <text start="343.65" dur="5.99">is there still cleaning out the courts</text>
  <text start="347.37" dur="4.98">Trump is still appointing new judges</text>
  <text start="349.64" dur="5.74">they&amp;#39;re still cleaning people out of the</text>
  <text start="352.35" dur="5.4">FBI Department of Justice to get the</text>
  <text start="355.38" dur="5.099">justice system where it can prosecute</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="5.58">people and have a reasonable expectation</text>
  <text start="360.479" dur="5.131">that high-ranking corrupt people are</text>
  <text start="363.33" dur="5.58">going to be prosecuted successfully and</text>
  <text start="365.61" dur="5.429">convicted you know I I always tell</text>
  <text start="368.91" dur="3.69">people who are like oh there&amp;#39;s no arrest</text>
  <text start="371.039" dur="3.901">no one&amp;#39;s been arrested no one&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="372.6" dur="6.3">held accountable where I&amp;#39;m like you know</text>
  <text start="374.94" dur="5.789">what if all Trump wanted was just to</text>
  <text start="378.9" dur="3.06">arrest a bunch of corrupt people they</text>
  <text start="380.729" dur="4.531">could he could have done that today</text>
  <text start="381.96" dur="5.55">after he got in the White House he could</text>
  <text start="385.26" dur="3.36">have run it up Hillary and Comey and</text>
  <text start="387.51" dur="3.18">clapper and Brennan he could had</text>
  <text start="388.62" dur="4.41">arrested them all the week that he got</text>
  <text start="390.69" dur="4.74">after he got inaugurated every one of</text>
  <text start="393.03" dur="4.77">them would have escaped justice every</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="5.459">one of them the prosecutors would have</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="4.649">bungled the prosecution or the FBI</text>
  <text start="400.889" dur="4.171">would have bungled the investigation and</text>
  <text start="402.449" dur="4.351">they would have walked because that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="405.06" dur="4.71">the system that Trump inherited he</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="5.1">inherited a corrupt justice system</text>
  <text start="409.77" dur="4.44">two-tiered system of justice that let</text>
  <text start="411.9" dur="5.069">corrupt people walk they&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="4.59">prosecute anyone until they are</text>
  <text start="416.969" dur="5.401">absolutely certain that those people are</text>
  <text start="418.8" dur="7.799">going to be convicted and that means Bar</text>
  <text start="422.37" dur="7.74">is in the process of continuing the</text>
  <text start="426.599" dur="6.261">clean-out of the DOJ and we know that</text>
  <text start="430.11" dur="4.919">Bar and US Attorney John Durham are</text>
  <text start="432.86" dur="5.619">personally overseeing the investigation</text>
  <text start="435.029" dur="5.79">of these corrupt people why because Bart</text>
  <text start="438.479" dur="6.171">probably doesn&amp;#39;t trust anyone to do it</text>
  <text start="440.819" dur="7.861">but himself this is such an important</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="6.91">task for bar and Trump that bar is</text>
  <text start="448.68" dur="7.789">personally overseeing this investigation</text>
  <text start="451.56" dur="9.509">of Brennan clapper Comey Loretta Lynch</text>
  <text start="456.469" dur="7.331">Sally AIT&amp;#39;s Susan Rice Obama high-level</text>
  <text start="461.069" dur="5.551">people I can from what we&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="4.53">Barr is personally overseeing the</text>
  <text start="466.62" dur="3.12">investigation of these people because</text>
  <text start="468.33" dur="5.869">probably because he doesn&amp;#39;t trust anyone</text>
  <text start="469.74" dur="6.959">to do it but himself him and Durham so</text>
  <text start="474.199" dur="4.45">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re taking their time and</text>
  <text start="476.699" dur="4.59">they&amp;#39;re gonna do this right because they</text>
  <text start="478.649" dur="4.92">only get it one chance to do this and if</text>
  <text start="481.289" dur="4.5">they screw it up those people walk they</text>
  <text start="483.569" dur="5.791">cannot afford to pull the trigger early</text>
  <text start="485.789" dur="9.271">they have to get a t&amp;#39;s crossed and the</text>
  <text start="489.36" dur="10.2">I&amp;#39;s dotted otherwise these people are</text>
  <text start="495.06" dur="8.06">not going to see justice so one of the</text>
  <text start="499.56" dur="5.849">things that I noticed in Hugh&amp;#39;s post is</text>
  <text start="503.12" dur="6.279">we&amp;#39;ve been given an order of operations</text>
  <text start="505.409" dur="5.611">so first the Department of Justice has</text>
  <text start="509.399" dur="3.87">to be cleaned out because they prosecute</text>
  <text start="511.02" dur="4.47">the FBI has to be cleaned up because FBI</text>
  <text start="513.269" dur="6.18">does investigations the courts have to</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="5.459">be I suspect that one of the reasons why</text>
  <text start="519.449" dur="4.77">Trump is appointing so many judges is</text>
  <text start="520.949" dur="6.621">they want to try these cases in courts</text>
  <text start="524.219" dur="7.11">where they have judges that are not</text>
  <text start="527.57" dur="5.079">corrupt who are not going to find some</text>
  <text start="531.329" dur="3.331">kind of legal way to let these people</text>
  <text start="532.649" dur="5.651">walk</text>
  <text start="534.66" dur="6.91">once the justice system has been cleaned</text>
  <text start="538.3" dur="5.7">out then they can start the prosecution</text>
  <text start="541.57" dur="5.25">now the order of operations that Q gave</text>
  <text start="544" dur="5.28">us is first we needed to get through the</text>
  <text start="546.82" dur="5.16">Muller witch-hunt well our witch-hunt is</text>
  <text start="549.28" dur="3.06">done the next thing that was supposed to</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="3.75">happen</text>
  <text start="552.34" dur="6.03">according to Q is declassification of</text>
  <text start="555.73" dur="8.67">all these documents related to Spygate</text>
  <text start="558.37" dur="7.02">so we have a kind of a partial laundry</text>
  <text start="564.4" dur="3.69">list of things that are gonna be</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="5.69">declassified the gang of eight</text>
