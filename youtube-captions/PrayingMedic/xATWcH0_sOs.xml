  <text start="72.8" dur="8.55">revelation how&amp;#39;s it going it&amp;#39;s going</text>

  <text start="92.57" dur="4.799">of you know feel like I&amp;#39;m getting caught</text>
  <text start="94.28" dur="4.159">up barely i&amp;#39;m really interested right</text>
  <text start="97.369" dur="3.21">the fact that you&amp;#39;re writing about</text>
  <text start="98.439" dur="5.261">progressive revelation do you know</text>
  <text start="100.579" dur="5.82">Richard Murray I do not Richard is an</text>
  <text start="103.7" dur="5.43">attorney and he is a really amazing</text>
  <text start="106.399" dur="4.68">theologian as well as a really</text>
  <text start="109.13" dur="4.409">out-of-the-box thinker and he writes</text>
  <text start="111.079" dur="3.981">about a lot of the concepts at you and I</text>
  <text start="113.539" dur="4.801">were talking about the other night on</text>
  <text start="115.06" dur="6.129">progressive revelation yeah where you</text>
  <text start="118.34" dur="4.559">take the Old Testament writings and you</text>
  <text start="121.189" dur="3.96">have to sort of look at them through New</text>
  <text start="122.899" dur="5.01">Testament eyes and realize that God is</text>
  <text start="125.149" dur="5.31">unfolding a plant he&amp;#39;s unfolding sure</text>
  <text start="127.909" dur="5.191">evolution of himself his kingdom and if</text>
  <text start="130.459" dur="4.741">you lean too heavily on some of the</text>
  <text start="133.1" dur="4.08">earlier writings you&amp;#39;re going to miss</text>
  <text start="135.2" dur="4.23">some of the fullness of what he revealed</text>
  <text start="137.18" dur="3.809">later on if you don&amp;#39;t mesh the two of</text>
  <text start="139.43" dur="3.66">them together this is a fascinating</text>
  <text start="140.989" dur="4.71">conversation and I kind of caught that</text>
  <text start="143.09" dur="4.14">you really like that theme and you know</text>
  <text start="145.699" dur="4.051">this is a wrestling match for made it</text>
  <text start="147.23" dur="2.74">probably maybe more so for me that it</text>
  <text start="149.75" dur="2.29">might</text>
  <text start="149.97" dur="4.35">be for you and others and you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="152.04" dur="4.95">like that post that you responded very</text>
  <text start="154.32" dur="5.37">well to is is me really wrestling out</text>
  <text start="156.99" dur="4.41">some very current questions and dynamics</text>
  <text start="159.69" dur="4.38">and things got speaking to me about it</text>
  <text start="161.4" dur="5.34">that quite honestly I don&amp;#39;t think you</text>
  <text start="164.07" dur="4.89">know a lot of people in the established</text>
  <text start="166.74" dur="3.69">Christian community are comfortable with</text>
  <text start="168.96" dur="2.91">the idea one things I was trying to</text>
  <text start="170.43" dur="4.47">write about in that post and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="171.87" dur="5.07">know how well I did is dealing with you</text>
  <text start="174.9" dur="4.89">might say the the mystery or the</text>
  <text start="176.94" dur="5.7">challenge of the fact that God did and</text>
  <text start="179.79" dur="4.5">has moved through the older forms but</text>
  <text start="182.64" dur="3.39">he&amp;#39;s more than those forms i think</text>
  <text start="184.29" dur="3.09">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the challenge i don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="186.03" dur="3.27">really know how to articulate that as</text>
  <text start="187.38" dur="3.72">well as i&amp;#39;d like I mean because I think</text>
  <text start="189.3" dur="4.74">sometimes those who want to embrace a</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="5.28">progressive revelation idea end up</text>
  <text start="194.04" dur="4.95">coming up with a conclusion that really</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="5.28">we would refute or reject anything prior</text>
  <text start="198.99" dur="5.219">to the fullest expression in a the</text>
  <text start="201.66" dur="5.88">difficulty is somehow God has moved in</text>
  <text start="204.209" dur="5.371">those past depictions and yet he&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="207.54" dur="3.75">than those depictions and I do feel like</text>
  <text start="209.58" dur="3.18">some are ready to write off you know</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="4.77">Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="5.31">Deuteronomy you almost presented as if</text>
  <text start="216.06" dur="4.56">that there&amp;#39;s not value in that at all</text>
  <text start="218.07" dur="5.61">and I don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s healthy to</text>
  <text start="220.62" dur="6.42">say that any revelation of Scripture is</text>
  <text start="223.68" dur="5.309">is negative or bad I do think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.04" dur="4.729">something to be said about saying that</text>
  <text start="228.989" dur="4.951">that the later revelation has full</text>
  <text start="231.769" dur="4.121">dimension and we need to interpret in</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="3.99">light of that I do believe in</text>
  <text start="235.89" dur="4.65">progressive revelation but it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="4.71">God is positioning new revelation</text>
  <text start="240.54" dur="5.009">against old I think they&amp;#39;re sort of both</text>
  <text start="242.64" dur="6.03">true I say it this way I think it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="6.451">of like Microsoft DOS program on</text>
  <text start="248.67" dur="6.21">computers doss maybe could be like it</text>
  <text start="252" dur="5.549">into Old Covenant realities and</text>
  <text start="254.88" dur="5.49">obviously what is better is built on to</text>
  <text start="257.549" dur="6.151">that and it&amp;#39;s so much more dynamic but</text>
  <text start="260.37" dur="6.51">to to position like Windows versus das</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="5.61">is probably not a fair characterization</text>
  <text start="266.88" dur="4.32">because it&amp;#39;s not either it&amp;#39;s not one</text>
  <text start="269.31" dur="4.7">against the other as much as one is a</text>
  <text start="271.2" dur="7.26">greater expression thing that really</text>
  <text start="274.01" dur="6.55">interests me about this subject is you</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="5.37">are talking about how God manifested</text>
  <text start="280.56" dur="7.05">himself to polytheistic</text>
  <text start="283.83" dur="5.43">cultures yes okay so that&amp;#39;s where you</text>
  <text start="287.61" dur="4.56">really have to start and you have to</text>
  <text start="289.26" dur="5.76">think okay what were these cultures like</text>
  <text start="292.17" dur="7.08">and what were their existing views of</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="6.99">the gods you&amp;#39;ve hidden God had to in a</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="5.43">way he had to couch his reality in his</text>
  <text start="302.01" dur="5.19">revelation in a way that these people</text>
  <text start="304.68" dur="5.04">could relate to exactly and they had a</text>
  <text start="307.2" dur="4.32">limited ability to understand who he was</text>
  <text start="309.72" dur="3.81">and what his plan was and what the</text>
  <text start="311.52" dur="3.78">kingdom of darkness is like and what the</text>
  <text start="313.53" dur="3.84">spiritual world is like hackling they</text>
  <text start="315.3" dur="5.04">had a very very limited ability to</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="5.31">appreciate that stuff so he had to sort</text>
  <text start="320.34" dur="5.67">of dumb down if you will yeah I agree</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="5.4">his reality of who he is because in the</text>
  <text start="326.01" dur="4.73">fullness of times he would be able to</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="4.95">give them a fuller more complex more</text>
  <text start="330.74" dur="4.63">enlightened revelation yeah I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="333.03" dur="4.08">convinced that&amp;#39;s true it really helps</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="3.33">like you and I both have had experience</text>
  <text start="337.11" dur="2.88">of praying for people and you know</text>
  <text start="338.7" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s no question that it&amp;#39;s the father</text>
  <text start="339.99" dur="3.54">is hard to heal yeah that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="342.03" dur="3.45">revelation we understand we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="343.53" dur="3.75">necessarily see that as clearly and some</text>
  <text start="345.48" dur="3.33">of the earlier passes the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="3.15">but I don&amp;#39;t really believe God changed</text>
  <text start="348.81" dur="3.72">its character nature along the way</text>
  <text start="350.43" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s a passage I&amp;#39;m kind of I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="6.03">have in front of me but I I believe its</text>
  <text start="354.39" dur="7.65">1st Samuel the text says that the anger</text>
  <text start="358.56" dur="5.67">of the Lord stirred David to do a census</text>
  <text start="362.04" dur="3.81">and to count the men and and the text</text>
  <text start="364.23" dur="4.14">suggests obviously this is something</text>
  <text start="365.85" dur="5.01">Lord is displeased with however 500</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="5.13">years later approximately 1st chronicles</text>
  <text start="370.86" dur="6.15">I believe that says that it was actually</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="5.25">Satan who incited David to count them in</text>
  <text start="377.01" dur="3.54">and so you hear you have one text</text>
  <text start="378.75" dur="3.36">suggesting it&amp;#39;s the Lord or the anger</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="4.89">the Lord doing and another text is</text>
  <text start="382.11" dur="5.22">suggesting that it is a Satan and I</text>
  <text start="385.44" dur="4.14">think that what we see is that a later</text>
  <text start="387.33" dur="3.63">revelation because you know the verses</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="3.69">that chronicles are some of the newest</text>
  <text start="390.96" dur="3.72">of the Old Testament books and I you</text>
  <text start="393.27" dur="3.09">know there&amp;#39;s a greater revelation that</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="3.69">it&amp;#39;s not in fact God that did this at</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="4.07">all and that maybe God wasn&amp;#39;t causing</text>
  <text start="398.37" dur="4.23">all the trouble that we think he was</text>
  <text start="400.43" dur="5.08">yeah it&amp;#39;s interesting because when you</text>
  <text start="402.6" dur="5.43">read the writings of Moses Moses really</text>
  <text start="405.51" dur="5.01">doesn&amp;#39;t write anything about Satan and</text>
  <text start="408.03" dur="6.66">the kind of darkness it was almost like</text>
  <text start="410.52" dur="6.3">an unknown entity to him sure and yet</text>
  <text start="414.69" dur="2.82">Jesus comes along and Paul comes along</text>
  <text start="416.82" dur="2.88">and they have</text>
  <text start="417.51" dur="4.68">all this revelation about the schemes of</text>
  <text start="419.7" dur="5.04">Satan and realms of darkness and demonic</text>
  <text start="422.19" dur="4.62">agendas which the Old Testament writers</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="4.26">didn&amp;#39;t have yeah to me it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="426.81" dur="4.02">valuable to look at the scriptures and</text>
  <text start="429" dur="3.93">like I&amp;#39;m sure you would agree with this</text>
  <text start="430.83" dur="3.54">there are people who tend to throw the</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="2.85">baby out with the bathwater and think</text>
  <text start="434.37" dur="4.29">the Old Testaments of no value at all</text>
  <text start="435.78" dur="6.15">which is not true and then there are</text>
  <text start="438.66" dur="5.22">people who are kind of a little stuck on</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="4.14">the Old Testament and they have not</text>
  <text start="443.88" dur="4.74">really gotten that revelation of the New</text>
  <text start="446.07" dur="4.2">Covenant and what it means I agree it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="448.62" dur="3.81">driving between the ditches you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="450.27" dur="3.9">want to end up because you gotta cook on</text>
  <text start="452.43" dur="3.24">the middle of the road it is you know I</text>
  <text start="454.17" dur="3.48">wrestled this because I you know I</text>
  <text start="455.67" dur="4.08">fellowship on a variety of levels of the</text>
  <text start="457.65" dur="3.69">variety of people I&amp;#39;m part of a</text>
  <text start="459.75" dur="4.44">particular group that kind of has more</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="5.79">of an optimistic in time view and that</text>
  <text start="464.19" dur="5.4">means covenant guys and love these guys</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="4.65">and you know I&amp;#39;m probably more where</text>
  <text start="469.59" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;re at honestly but but you know</text>
  <text start="471.78" dur="4.92">sometimes what they&amp;#39;re saying might not</text>
  <text start="474.9" dur="3.66">be received well by some of the other</text>
  <text start="476.7" dur="4.14">more conservative actually church worker</text>
  <text start="478.56" dur="4.02">guys that I work with on another not got</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="4.95">love both of these people and don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="5.31">war between confidence but what I do see</text>
  <text start="485.79" dur="3.66">is that they&amp;#39;re traditionalists that</text>
  <text start="487.89" dur="3.57">need to really understand the glory the</text>
  <text start="489.45" dur="3.87">goodness and the power of who the Lord</text>
  <text start="491.46" dur="3.24">really is and in through Jesus you know</text>
  <text start="493.32" dur="3.75">that we&amp;#39;re not still dealing with some</text>
  <text start="494.7" dur="3.78">kind of retributive reality and the</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="4.05">question is whether God in fact ever</text>
  <text start="498.48" dur="3.75">really was fully that way anyway getting</text>
  <text start="501.12" dur="3.63">back to kind of our whole conversation</text>
  <text start="502.23" dur="5.07">in general you know we believe as</text>
  <text start="504.75" dur="5.37">Christians that God stepped in the time</text>
  <text start="507.3" dur="5.28">and history in order to bring revelation</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="4.89">to bring salvation it&amp;#39;s a very pivotal</text>
  <text start="512.58" dur="4.74">part of our faith that may be different</text>
  <text start="515.01" dur="4.65">than most other world religion i mean we</text>
  <text start="517.32" dur="4.98">believe that God enter time but in doing</text>
  <text start="519.66" dur="5.55">that you have to in a sense move into</text>
  <text start="522.3" dur="4.8">the time realm history culture of that</text>
  <text start="525.21" dur="4.11">time or you can&amp;#39;t in fact move within</text>
  <text start="527.1" dur="4.17">time in history and so I think the core</text>
  <text start="529.32" dur="4.74">of our conversation here that God was</text>
  <text start="531.27" dur="4.74">willing to do that and maybe convey the</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="4.95">reality of who he is within the</text>
  <text start="536.01" dur="6">retributive language within the the very</text>
  <text start="539.01" dur="5.61">judicial motifs because those do convey</text>
  <text start="542.01" dur="4.83">aspects of who he is but the intent was</text>
  <text start="544.62" dur="5.49">all along to bring them ultimately</text>
  <text start="546.84" dur="3.7">through time culture and history to a</text>
  <text start="550.11" dur="1.87">great</text>
  <text start="550.54" dur="3.99">revelation which of course would be in</text>
  <text start="551.98" dur="5.79">Jesus ultimately and the thing is those</text>
  <text start="554.53" dur="6.03">revelations at that time they did convey</text>
  <text start="557.77" dur="6.45">a partial reality of who God is Miss</text>
  <text start="560.56" dur="6.87">full reality of who he is they conveyed</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="5.79">shadows and types and sort of incomplete</text>
  <text start="567.43" dur="4.5">glimpses of who God is in his glory and</text>
  <text start="570.01" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s interesting to me when I think</text>
  <text start="571.93" dur="3.72">about how God has revealed himself to me</text>
  <text start="573.73" dur="4.68">personally years ago when I started</text>
  <text start="575.65" dur="4.89">having dreams most of the language of my</text>
  <text start="578.41" dur="4.74">dreams is very simplistic because I</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="5.64">didn&amp;#39;t have a great spiritual awareness</text>
  <text start="583.15" dur="6">yeah of who God was and so God kind of</text>
  <text start="586.18" dur="4.29">dumb down his conversations with me to a</text>
  <text start="589.15" dur="2.94">level where I could understand what he</text>
  <text start="590.47" dur="5.52">was talking about I where I&amp;#39;m at right</text>
  <text start="592.09" dur="5.67">now yeah but the interesting thing and</text>
  <text start="595.99" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;ve noticed as I&amp;#39;ve looked at my dream</text>
  <text start="597.76" dur="5.72">journal over the last year I&amp;#39;m having a</text>
  <text start="600.58" dur="6.69">lot more what I call conceptual dreams</text>
  <text start="603.48" dur="6.49">where he doesn&amp;#39;t speak to me in clear</text>
  <text start="607.27" dur="4.8">symbolic imagery or scenes where I see</text>
  <text start="609.97" dur="5.16">myself acting out something in a dream</text>
  <text start="612.07" dur="5.22">years ago I would often see myself in a</text>
  <text start="615.13" dur="3.9">dream with my wife with people I knew</text>
  <text start="617.29" dur="3.39">and we&amp;#39;re doing things that was very</text>
  <text start="619.03" dur="5.43">typical of the dreams that used to have</text>
  <text start="620.68" dur="5.94">the dreams i have now are very gosh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="624.46" dur="4.05">so hard to describe some of them because</text>
  <text start="626.62" dur="4.32">what he&amp;#39;s really doing is conveying</text>
  <text start="628.51" dur="4.29">these deep spiritual principles from</text>
  <text start="630.94" dur="4.41">thought to thought life&amp;#39;s like the Holy</text>
  <text start="632.8" dur="5.67">Spirit is speaking to my spirit in</text>
  <text start="635.35" dur="6.15">spiritual language yes and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="638.47" dur="5.01">difficult to articulate in words much</text>
  <text start="641.5" dur="4.26">less describing pictures what is being</text>
  <text start="643.48" dur="4.2">revealed there is this spirit to spirit</text>
  <text start="645.76" dur="4.5">communication it&amp;#39;s almost like tongues</text>
  <text start="647.68" dur="4.74">if you were attractive tongues it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="650.26" dur="4.23">really difficult to do and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="652.42" dur="3.81">kind of Revelation he&amp;#39;s giving me a lot</text>
  <text start="654.49" dur="4.8">in last year and that&amp;#39;s because as I</text>
  <text start="656.23" dur="6.06">walked with him through time his</text>
  <text start="659.29" dur="4.74">revelation to me is getting deeper and a</text>
  <text start="662.29" dur="3.69">little bit more mysterious but</text>
  <text start="664.03" dur="4.17">definitely it&amp;#39;s a full of revelation of</text>
  <text start="665.98" dur="3.72">him this kingdom and I see that same</text>
  <text start="668.2" dur="4.26">concept being worked out through the</text>
  <text start="669.7" dur="4.44">scriptures yes with some basic building</text>
  <text start="672.46" dur="3.99">blocks that most people can understand</text>
  <text start="674.14" dur="3.51">this is what you have a grid for this is</text>
  <text start="676.45" dur="3.24">what I&amp;#39;m going to reveal to you today</text>
  <text start="677.65" dur="4.08">but realize that&amp;#39;s not the fullness of</text>
  <text start="679.69" dur="3.94">what I want to reveal to you if it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="681.73" dur="3.88">partial revelation of</text>
  <text start="683.63" dur="3.93">what I want you to know there&amp;#39;s more</text>
  <text start="685.61" dur="4.17">coming when you mature when you grow up</text>
  <text start="687.56" dur="4.95">and as things progress and you get this</text>
  <text start="689.78" dur="4.86">we&amp;#39;ll have more conversations about how</text>
  <text start="692.51" dur="4.29">this looks in the fullness that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="694.64" dur="4.2">see going on yeah I have an agreement</text>
  <text start="696.8" dur="4.26">with you you know these are incredible</text>
  <text start="698.84" dur="4.17">wrestling matches you know but you know</text>
  <text start="701.06" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s a culture of people you might</text>
  <text start="703.01" dur="5.13">say pressing into God you know trying to</text>
  <text start="706.01" dur="4.56">you know maybe get things right with God</text>
  <text start="708.14" dur="4.68">sometimes when this is a preach some</text>
  <text start="710.57" dur="3.96">people have an attitude often that</text>
  <text start="712.82" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;re always not quite right with God</text>
  <text start="714.53" dur="4.74">and so it wouldn&amp;#39;t be unusual one of our</text>
  <text start="716.99" dur="4.59">meetings for somebody maybe they&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="719.27" dur="4.08">a bad week or two maybe they&amp;#39;ve missed</text>
  <text start="721.58" dur="3.15">that they&amp;#39;ve blown it and they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="723.35" dur="3.12">gonna press in they might do something</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="3.39">like run for and scrape their nose</text>
  <text start="726.47" dur="3.48">across the carpet not not to hurt</text>
  <text start="728.12" dur="3.99">themselves but just crying out to God</text>
  <text start="729.95" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s a good thing I mean I want to be</text>
  <text start="732.11" dur="4.59">negative toward that but what God&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="734.45" dur="4.32">showing me is this that the person</text>
  <text start="736.7" dur="3.99">didn&amp;#39;t necessarily have to scrape across</text>
  <text start="738.77" dur="4.02">the carpet or didn&amp;#39;t have to do penance</text>
  <text start="740.69" dur="4.5">a person doesn&amp;#39;t have to jump through</text>
  <text start="742.79" dur="6.09">all these hoops but at the same time God</text>
  <text start="745.19" dur="6">will use those things and you know bring</text>
  <text start="748.88" dur="4.41">good out of it God doesn&amp;#39;t have to use</text>
  <text start="751.19" dur="4.53">so many of the forms that we used you</text>
  <text start="753.29" dur="4.68">know he would accept us or receive us if</text>
  <text start="755.72" dur="4.95">we just came to me you know connect with</text>
  <text start="757.97" dur="5.28">him love him serve him without any kind</text>
  <text start="760.67" dur="6.06">of external however for most of us that</text>
  <text start="763.25" dur="5.88">just doesn&amp;#39;t work so he uses you might</text>
  <text start="766.73" dur="6.27">say our religion he uses our sacrifices</text>
  <text start="769.13" dur="6.36">he uses our our agonizing prayer he uses</text>
  <text start="773" dur="3.69">our wailing and I want to say this and</text>
  <text start="775.49" dur="2.91">this is something I want maybe the new</text>
  <text start="776.69" dur="5.37">covenant people to understand that the</text>
  <text start="778.4" dur="6.6">God does use that and and that there can</text>
  <text start="782.06" dur="5.43">be some good out of that but he would</text>
  <text start="785" dur="3.81">say you don&amp;#39;t have to do all that I you</text>
  <text start="787.49" dur="3.21">know I&amp;#39;m not a God up here you know</text>
  <text start="788.81" dur="3.81">trying to make sure i get my just</text>
  <text start="790.7" dur="3.63">penalty before I you know I come near</text>
  <text start="792.62" dur="3.99">you or whatever that&amp;#39;s a really good way</text>
  <text start="794.33" dur="4.59">of looking at it too because like you I</text>
  <text start="796.61" dur="7.08">know people who have some very to me</text>
  <text start="798.92" dur="7.65">very odd behavior before God so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="803.69" dur="4.98">very self-effacing and they&amp;#39;re feel like</text>
  <text start="806.57" dur="4.47">they need to put themselves through all</text>
  <text start="808.67" dur="5.22">this torment and agony and repentance</text>
  <text start="811.04" dur="4.59">and you know self-denial and confession</text>
  <text start="813.89" dur="3.43">of sins and also stuff and like you said</text>
  <text start="815.63" dur="3.76">if we choose</text>
  <text start="817.32" dur="3.9">to come to God that way he&amp;#39;ll accept</text>
  <text start="819.39" dur="4.08">this that way but that is not the way</text>
  <text start="821.22" dur="4.11">all of us have to come to God and Jack</text>
  <text start="823.47" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s probably not the preferred way for</text>
  <text start="825.33" dur="4.53">us to come the gun I have a lot of</text>
  <text start="827.19" dur="5.25">conversations with Jeremy machine and I</text>
  <text start="829.86" dur="4.47">really like his relationship with God</text>
  <text start="832.44" dur="5.22">because what he does is he has this</text>
  <text start="834.33" dur="5.7">place in his soul where he knows how</text>
  <text start="837.66" dur="4.53">much he is loved by the father and he</text>
  <text start="840.03" dur="4.47">knows that he and the father are cool</text>
  <text start="842.19" dur="3.66">like God is really cool with him and he</text>
  <text start="844.5" dur="4.26">doesn&amp;#39;t feel like he has to go through</text>
  <text start="845.85" dur="5.94">all those gymnastics to please God or to</text>
  <text start="848.76" dur="5.46">appease gun he knows that he knows that</text>
  <text start="851.79" dur="4.29">God is okay with who he is and Jeremy</text>
  <text start="854.22" dur="3.9">operates from a place of rest where he</text>
  <text start="856.08" dur="4.38">accomplishes a lot gets a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="858.12" dur="4.89">done but it&amp;#39;s not done from striving in</text>
  <text start="860.46" dur="5.79">order to try to make God happy yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="863.01" dur="6.48">done from a place where he is partnering</text>
  <text start="866.25" dur="4.95">with God and only this and it&amp;#39;s all from</text>
  <text start="869.49" dur="3.93">rest and it&amp;#39;s all from this confident</text>
  <text start="871.2" dur="4.59">knowing that he&amp;#39;s okay with God and</text>
  <text start="873.42" dur="4.65">God&amp;#39;s okay with him yeah and I think if</text>
  <text start="875.79" dur="4.35">you get to that place that&amp;#39;s probably a</text>
  <text start="878.07" dur="4.59">preferred place I think God prefers that</text>
  <text start="880.14" dur="3.96">yeah well i agree with you i mean i&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="882.66" dur="3.12">been learning bad i mean i come like I</text>
  <text start="884.1" dur="2.97">said I come from a classical Pentecostal</text>
  <text start="885.78" dur="3.33">background or if you don&amp;#39;t feel bad</text>
  <text start="887.07" dur="4.35">enough about yourself you probably</text>
  <text start="889.11" dur="4.17">missing God somehow you know the church</text>
  <text start="891.42" dur="4.29">is about feeling bad about yourself and</text>
  <text start="893.28" dur="4.59">right you know I&amp;#39;ve had some amazing</text>
  <text start="895.71" dur="3.96">breakthroughs and what you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="897.87" dur="3.93">about and you know just that glory and</text>
  <text start="899.67" dur="3.99">goodness and love of the Father you know</text>
  <text start="901.8" dur="3.81">that sometimes the issue at hand is more</text>
  <text start="903.66" dur="3.6">relational breakdown anything else you</text>
  <text start="905.61" dur="4.05">know that God God just wants to you know</text>
  <text start="907.26" dur="4.23">bring us back into a right connection</text>
  <text start="909.66" dur="3.36">relationally with him and I mean I think</text>
  <text start="911.49" dur="3.96">even as we&amp;#39;re getting this in</text>
  <text start="913.02" dur="4.62">understanding this you know for better</text>
  <text start="915.45" dur="3.9">or worse you know I think you know some</text>
  <text start="917.64" dur="3.57">people there in a stage where they need</text>
  <text start="919.35" dur="3.3">some of the other I mean they think and</text>
  <text start="921.21" dur="4.62">I don&amp;#39;t think it necessarily always</text>
  <text start="922.65" dur="5.91">serves us well to overly critique that</text>
  <text start="925.83" dur="4.62">in the sense that they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="928.56" dur="3.75">sincerely before the father that way and</text>
  <text start="930.45" dur="3.63">I guess that&amp;#39;s the revelation I&amp;#39;m kind</text>
  <text start="932.31" dur="3.78">of trying to say that God uses our</text>
  <text start="934.08" dur="4.44">religion it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="936.09" dur="5.13">necessarily good or bad in fact I think</text>
  <text start="938.52" dur="4.95">that&amp;#39;s the thing he&amp;#39;s so big and so good</text>
  <text start="941.22" dur="4.65">like it almost doesn&amp;#39;t bother him yeah</text>
  <text start="943.47" dur="4.71">well I think what he does is he uses our</text>
  <text start="945.87" dur="4.68">religion to get us into place where he</text>
  <text start="948.18" dur="2.97">really wants us he doesn&amp;#39;t want us to</text>
  <text start="950.55" dur="2.76">stay</text>
  <text start="951.15" dur="4.17">those religious postures of our heart he</text>
  <text start="953.31" dur="3.54">will acknowledge the fact that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="955.32" dur="3.18">there but he wants to move us to</text>
  <text start="956.85" dur="3.99">somewhere else a really good</text>
  <text start="958.5" dur="5.13">illustration of this is in the book</text>
  <text start="960.84" dur="4.68">placebo that was written by I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="963.63" dur="5.01">think of his name he was a Baptist</text>
  <text start="965.52" dur="4.86">preacher who died and went to heaven and</text>
  <text start="968.64" dur="4.02">he had this near-death experience</text>
  <text start="970.38" dur="4.47">testimony that is really amazing he has</text>
  <text start="972.66" dur="4.53">taken before the throne of the Father</text>
  <text start="974.85" dur="4.56">and because he was a Baptist preacher</text>
  <text start="977.19" dur="3.42">and he was a little bit self-righteous</text>
  <text start="979.41" dur="4.26">because he thought he was doing a whole</text>
  <text start="980.61" dur="4.74">lot of really cool stuff for God he to</text>
  <text start="983.67" dur="3.51">the throne of God with a little bit of</text>
  <text start="985.35" dur="5.4">pride and arrogance about what he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="987.18" dur="6.96">accomplished and he was met by God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="990.75" dur="5.93">anger and rebuke and he left the throne</text>
  <text start="994.14" dur="4.68">of god in his experience sorrowful and</text>
  <text start="996.68" dur="4.27">disappointed and really kind of loathing</text>
  <text start="998.82" dur="4.62">himself for his arrogance and</text>
  <text start="1000.95" dur="3.96">presumption so the angels take him lead</text>
  <text start="1003.44" dur="3.75">him away from the throne of god and he</text>
  <text start="1004.91" dur="4.05">goes to this experience where the angels</text>
  <text start="1007.19" dur="4.08">are teaching them about the realms of</text>
  <text start="1008.96" dur="4.8">heaven and demons and he keeps asking</text>
  <text start="1011.27" dur="4.35">the Angels if he can go back and visit</text>
  <text start="1013.76" dur="4.68">God again at the throat because he wants</text>
  <text start="1015.62" dur="4.92">to go see him again and ask for mercy he</text>
  <text start="1018.44" dur="4.47">has this change of heart in this</text>
  <text start="1020.54" dur="3.9">experience yes and the Angels allowed</text>
  <text start="1022.91" dur="3.9">him to go back to the throne of God a</text>
  <text start="1024.44" dur="5.34">second time but this time he is much</text>
  <text start="1026.81" dur="6.54">more humble he&amp;#39;s much more real about</text>
  <text start="1029.78" dur="5.49">his own his own worthlessness and when</text>
  <text start="1033.35" dur="3.989">he to the throne of God he meets his</text>
  <text start="1035.27" dur="4.92">father who wraps him in this</text>
  <text start="1037.339" dur="4.921">all-consuming love yeah and he feels</text>
  <text start="1040.19" dur="5.97">this embrace and this warmth and his</text>
  <text start="1042.26" dur="5.91">love and that particular encounter was</text>
  <text start="1046.16" dur="3.62">really well described in the boat but</text>
  <text start="1048.17" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s interesting to me because I think</text>
  <text start="1049.78" dur="5.77">some people sense their worthlessness</text>
  <text start="1053.48" dur="4.38">and there and the fact that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1055.55" dur="4.68">right with God and when they come to</text>
  <text start="1057.86" dur="4.74">meet God they see this a steer</text>
  <text start="1060.23" dur="3.75">judgmental deity standing in front of</text>
  <text start="1062.6" dur="3.99">them they&amp;#39;re like oh my gosh you know I</text>
  <text start="1063.98" dur="6.69">have a horrible wicked center but then</text>
  <text start="1066.59" dur="6.84">that encounter changes us yes and when</text>
  <text start="1070.67" dur="4.68">we get real about who we are and we get</text>
  <text start="1073.43" dur="4.08">real about our works and our</text>
  <text start="1075.35" dur="3.39">righteousness and and we get real the</text>
  <text start="1077.51" dur="3.54">fact that we&amp;#39;re not all that and a bag</text>
  <text start="1078.74" dur="4.71">of chips that puts us in a place where</text>
  <text start="1081.05" dur="3.509">we can go back to God and say okay so</text>
  <text start="1083.45" dur="3.24">yeah</text>
  <text start="1084.559" dur="3.96">which not all that great so what can you</text>
  <text start="1086.69" dur="3.689">do for me when we approached him with</text>
  <text start="1088.519" dur="4.801">the right heart we find this loving</text>
  <text start="1090.379" dur="4.41">father who now the apple of his eye we</text>
  <text start="1093.32" dur="3.479">can&amp;#39;t do anything wrong everything&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1094.789" dur="5.431">great everything&amp;#39;s cool it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1096.799" dur="6.181">amazing how God can use a religion and</text>
  <text start="1100.22" dur="4.709">use those experiences to bring us to the</text>
  <text start="1102.98" dur="4.59">place where he really wants us to be</text>
  <text start="1104.929" dur="5.82">which is seeing ourselves as if beloved</text>
  <text start="1107.57" dur="5.429">child yeah you&amp;#39;re right on I&amp;#39;m so with</text>
  <text start="1110.749" dur="3.871">you on really being transformed by they</text>
  <text start="1112.999" dur="3.361">love and live and really understanding</text>
  <text start="1114.62" dur="2.909">the relational nature the father I mean</text>
  <text start="1116.36" dur="2.759">those are the things I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1117.529" dur="4.051">experienced over the last couple years</text>
  <text start="1119.119" dur="4.231">that has been amazing and well Moses</text>
  <text start="1121.58" dur="3.809">would be certainly conveyed pretty</text>
  <text start="1123.35" dur="4.949">judicially but you know when Israel hit</text>
  <text start="1125.389" dur="4.98">problems he fell down you know face down</text>
  <text start="1128.299" dur="4.47">before the father who gave him the idea</text>
  <text start="1130.369" dur="4.56">that he could petition of God to change</text>
  <text start="1132.769" dur="4.321">a situation or circumstance I mean</text>
  <text start="1134.929" dur="4.38">particularly if God is just purely you</text>
  <text start="1137.09" dur="4.23">know a retributive God you know who gave</text>
  <text start="1139.309" dur="4.97">him the idea that he could stand before</text>
  <text start="1141.32" dur="5.01">him and say hey you know would you</text>
  <text start="1144.279" dur="5.441">relentless knew something about the</text>
  <text start="1146.33" dur="5.01">father I think that we know as well you</text>
  <text start="1149.72" dur="2.939">look at Moises you look at Abraham some</text>
  <text start="1151.34" dur="3.27">of these key figures that seemed to have</text>
  <text start="1152.659" dur="4.26">a more intimate relationship David of</text>
  <text start="1154.61" dur="4.919">course they saw the father much more</text>
  <text start="1156.919" dur="4.921">kindly and Minh Evelyn Lee than maybe</text>
  <text start="1159.529" dur="3.78">others did and so again I you know I</text>
  <text start="1161.84" dur="3.089">think you know we&amp;#39;re trying to kind of</text>
  <text start="1163.309" dur="3.75">create a discontinuity between old new</text>
  <text start="1164.929" dur="4.38">test and I think the answer is to try to</text>
  <text start="1167.059" dur="4.23">find a better continuity here easy to</text>
  <text start="1169.309" dur="3.661">set up a false dichotomy and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1171.289" dur="2.791">think it&amp;#39;s helpful I think I&amp;#39;m an</text>
  <text start="1172.97" dur="3.39">agreement with you I don&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="1174.08" dur="4.62">helps to ignore the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="1176.36" dur="5.759">certainly doesn&amp;#39;t help to keep your eyes</text>
  <text start="1178.7" dur="6.209">shut to the amazing promises and of the</text>
  <text start="1182.119" dur="4.471">new covenant but I think your goal and</text>
  <text start="1184.909" dur="5.22">my goal are the same get encouraged our</text>
  <text start="1186.59" dur="5.549">friends to not be may be so one-sided in</text>
  <text start="1190.129" dur="4.8">the end of discussion yeah exactly</text>
  <text start="1192.139" dur="4.681">exactly it&amp;#39;s kind of hard as I do feel</text>
  <text start="1194.929" dur="3.271">like I&amp;#39;m kind of in a middle spot but I</text>
  <text start="1196.82" dur="3.329">don&amp;#39;t know the grooming people are in</text>
  <text start="1198.2" dur="4.109">maybe maybe you are with me there I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1200.149" dur="5.941">coming probably for more of a harsh</text>
  <text start="1202.309" dur="5.94">judicial side to the other I&amp;#39;m Way over</text>
  <text start="1206.09" dur="4.529">the other love of the Father experiences</text>
  <text start="1208.249" dur="5.071">that goodness enjoy I mean now I&amp;#39;m there</text>
  <text start="1210.619" dur="4.831">like give it to me like I read my blog</text>
  <text start="1213.32" dur="3.56">post so you know where my heart is yes I</text>
  <text start="1215.45" dur="3.35">feel like you have come from</text>
  <text start="1216.88" dur="3.57">you know the other side of the tracks in</text>
  <text start="1218.8" dur="3.42">a you know not work with a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1220.45" dur="3.21">i think probably almost a weekly basis</text>
  <text start="1222.22" dur="3.09">I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;m around a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1223.66" dur="4.41">that you are coming from a very rigid</text>
  <text start="1225.31" dur="4.47">harsh and I want to I want to transform</text>
  <text start="1228.07" dur="4.05">their lives I want to touch them i want</text>
  <text start="1229.78" dur="3.42">to encourage them and and if you beat</text>
  <text start="1232.12" dur="2.61">them down and tell them that their</text>
  <text start="1233.2" dur="4.29">theology is all screwed up you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1234.73" dur="4.08">going to help them absolutely not this</text>
  <text start="1237.49" dur="3">this idea we&amp;#39;re talking about how God</text>
  <text start="1238.81" dur="3.06">uses our religion you know this has been</text>
  <text start="1240.49" dur="3.12">something real encouraging for me</text>
  <text start="1241.87" dur="3.42">because it again shows you how big he</text>
  <text start="1243.61" dur="3.96">really is it&amp;#39;s like okay i&amp;#39;ll use that</text>
  <text start="1245.29" dur="4.71">up i&amp;#39;ll bring some good out of that i&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1247.57" dur="3.63">take somebody&amp;#39;s assumptions and go ahead</text>
  <text start="1250" dur="2.64">and run with them and take them to</text>
  <text start="1251.2" dur="4.08">another place or take them somewhere</text>
  <text start="1252.64" dur="4.92">deeper and ya mean you have to think</text>
  <text start="1255.28" dur="4.17">about how does God connect with people</text>
  <text start="1257.56" dur="3.96">who don&amp;#39;t have Bibles both through</text>
  <text start="1259.45" dur="3.57">history before the scriptures were</text>
  <text start="1261.52" dur="3.33">widely available and even today that in</text>
  <text start="1263.02" dur="4.08">a lot of countries are not it arab</text>
  <text start="1264.85" dur="5.28">nations where the bible is basically</text>
  <text start="1267.1" dur="4.71">outlawed how jesus speaking through to</text>
  <text start="1270.13" dur="3.69">muslims through all their dreams yeah</text>
  <text start="1271.81" dur="4.08">and it&amp;#39;s a lot of it has to do with</text>
  <text start="1273.82" dur="4.71">cultural norms and cultural relevance</text>
  <text start="1275.89" dur="5.37">arab cultures very highly value their</text>
  <text start="1278.53" dur="4.35">dreams yeah which is probably a lot of</text>
  <text start="1281.26" dur="3.72">the reason why jesus is appearing to so</text>
  <text start="1282.88" dur="4.68">many Muslims through dreams yeah because</text>
  <text start="1284.98" dur="4.74">they value dreams that God is using</text>
  <text start="1287.56" dur="3.48">something they value to speak to them</text>
  <text start="1289.72" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s a language they&amp;#39;re familiar with</text>
  <text start="1291.04" dur="4.68">yeah the herbs are also having these</text>
  <text start="1293.89" dur="3.9">credible dreams and actually you know</text>
  <text start="1295.72" dur="4.26">coming to fade sometimes even outside</text>
  <text start="1297.79" dur="4.05">the scriptures and right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1299.98" dur="3.51">blowing some people&amp;#39;s mom I&amp;#39;m okay with</text>
  <text start="1301.84" dur="4.26">that because I got a lot of friends and</text>
  <text start="1303.49" dur="5.37">colleagues that are not like saying you</text>
  <text start="1306.1" dur="6.57">know happy I&amp;#39;ve had some myself and I</text>
  <text start="1308.86" dur="5.64">feel it it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s amazing this whole</text>
  <text start="1312.67" dur="4.53">conversation we&amp;#39;re having obviously it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1314.5" dur="4.8">relevant in into the terms of healing is</text>
  <text start="1317.2" dur="4.62">God really a truly good and healing god</text>
  <text start="1319.3" dur="4.53">is he busy desire to restore the bodies</text>
  <text start="1321.82" dur="4.2">restore people&amp;#39;s lives and and you know</text>
  <text start="1323.83" dur="3.96">I think all the way from old Anu we can</text>
  <text start="1326.02" dur="3">say he is and even what we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1327.79" dur="2.97">understand is we looked at the Old</text>
  <text start="1329.02" dur="3.66">Testament I think comes into greater</text>
  <text start="1330.76" dur="4.56">clarity through progressive revelation</text>
  <text start="1332.68" dur="4.38">at the heart of the father is to touch</text>
  <text start="1335.32" dur="4.44">people&amp;#39;s lives to bring healing that</text>
  <text start="1337.06" dur="4.68">open and I would tell people that you</text>
  <text start="1339.76" dur="4.62">know who don&amp;#39;t know this that there is a</text>
  <text start="1341.74" dur="4.83">lot of the grace of God and the goodness</text>
  <text start="1344.38" dur="3.87">of God revealed in the Old Testament you</text>
  <text start="1346.57" dur="3.96">know God was raising people from the</text>
  <text start="1348.25" dur="3.96">dead and performing healing miracles</text>
  <text start="1350.53" dur="4.17">all kinds of other really cool stuff in</text>
  <text start="1352.21" dur="4.77">the Old Testament all throughout yeah I</text>
  <text start="1354.7" dur="5.4">think it&amp;#39;s really valuable to go back</text>
  <text start="1356.98" dur="4.59">and look it&amp;#39;s not as obvious there as it</text>
  <text start="1360.1" dur="4.62">is in the New Testament but it&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="1361.57" dur="4.8">if you look yeah it is there&amp;#39;s a concept</text>
  <text start="1364.72" dur="5.4">mule test was been very powerful to me</text>
  <text start="1366.37" dur="5.19">it&amp;#39;s Hebrew term has said but I think</text>
  <text start="1370.12" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;d be translated a lot in English is</text>
  <text start="1371.56" dur="4.2">loving faithfulness and there&amp;#39;s a number</text>
  <text start="1373.78" dur="3.93">of passages and talk about how God has</text>
  <text start="1375.76" dur="3.96">this has said for his people you know</text>
  <text start="1377.71" dur="4.35">this will keep us coming of love for a</text>
  <text start="1379.72" dur="4.92">thousand generations yeah it&amp;#39;s these</text>
  <text start="1382.06" dur="4.49">powerful revelations maybe snapshots if</text>
  <text start="1384.64" dur="5.04">you will but they speak of who he is and</text>
  <text start="1386.55" dur="6.49">incredible love is just you know it just</text>
  <text start="1389.68" dur="6.15">touches and changes and pursues and you</text>
  <text start="1393.04" dur="4.59">know it really I think one of the things</text>
  <text start="1395.83" dur="4.08">I want to maybe suggest that some people</text>
  <text start="1397.63" dur="4.35">who are of the more you know the New</text>
  <text start="1399.91" dur="3.42">Covenant perspective at all you know we</text>
  <text start="1401.98" dur="3.36">want to continue to wrestle with what</text>
  <text start="1403.33" dur="3.39">covenant really means it&amp;#39;s about you</text>
  <text start="1405.34" dur="2.73">know it&amp;#39;s about shared identity it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1406.72" dur="4.32">about family it&amp;#39;s about a relationship</text>
  <text start="1408.07" dur="4.92">it&amp;#39;s about all these incredible ideas</text>
  <text start="1411.04" dur="3.96">and even as we&amp;#39;re moving toward a</text>
  <text start="1412.99" dur="4.32">fresher more dynamic reality we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1415" dur="4.53">want to miss the value of what you know</text>
  <text start="1417.31" dur="3.57">we could find the Old Testament I know</text>
