  <text start="159.25" dur="4.2">prophesy in my life I didn&amp;#39;t know people</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="4.38">were still doing stuff like that</text>
  <text start="163.45" dur="11.43">I about Fela in fact I think I did fall</text>
  <text start="166.24" dur="11.28">on the floor yeah well the funny thing</text>
  <text start="174.88" dur="4.829">is after you came and visited our church</text>
  <text start="177.52" dur="4.11">and you were just prophesying over</text>
  <text start="179.709" dur="5.101">everybody and you prophesied over pastor</text>
  <text start="181.63" dur="6.359">George I&amp;#39;d literally crawled on the</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="9.11">floor and I said Lord if this is real I</text>
  <text start="187.989" dur="9.441">want it you really did inspire me to</text>
  <text start="193.92" dur="7.48">think outside the box and to think about</text>
  <text start="197.43" dur="6.4">the life as a believer in a much bigger</text>
  <text start="201.4" dur="4.29">way than I ever anticipated and then</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="6.239">right after that God started giving me</text>
  <text start="205.69" dur="6.69">dreams about prophecy and dreams about</text>
  <text start="210.069" dur="3.841">healing and dreams about deliverance and</text>
  <text start="212.38" dur="4.47">all this other stuff it wasn&amp;#39;t until</text>
  <text start="213.91" dur="6.18">after we met you and Denise went to your</text>
  <text start="216.85" dur="5.31">dream workshop in Spanaway I think right</text>
  <text start="220.09" dur="3.869">and you&amp;#39;re having a workshop and she</text>
  <text start="222.16" dur="3">went there and you said hey I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="223.959" dur="2.911">give you some homework go home and have</text>
  <text start="225.16" dur="4.829">a dream oh yeah and if you know somebody</text>
  <text start="226.87" dur="5.61">who isn&amp;#39;t having dreams pray over them</text>
  <text start="229.989" dur="5.101">and they&amp;#39;ll have dreams so Denise comes</text>
  <text start="232.48" dur="4.86">home from the workshop prays over me and</text>
  <text start="235.09" dur="5.1">that night I had my first dream in 25</text>
  <text start="237.34" dur="5.13">years and God appears to me in the dream</text>
  <text start="240.19" dur="5.48">and says I want you to pray for your</text>
  <text start="242.47" dur="6.78">patients and if you do I&amp;#39;ll heal them so</text>
  <text start="245.67" dur="6.28">that was quite a raucous beginning for</text>
  <text start="249.25" dur="4.5">you for you and I and we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve kept</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="3.659">in touch over the years but you&amp;#39;ve moved</text>
  <text start="253.75" dur="6.329">from Texas and now you&amp;#39;re living up in</text>
  <text start="255.609" dur="6.18">Tacoma you have been all over the place</text>
  <text start="260.079" dur="9.361">you are an itinerant prophet if there</text>
  <text start="261.789" dur="10.081">ever was one so a lot of people think</text>
  <text start="269.44" dur="3.75">dreams come from eating pizza or from</text>
  <text start="271.87" dur="3.48">what you&amp;#39;re thinking about before you go</text>
  <text start="273.19" dur="6.93">to bed where do you think dreams come</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="8.43">from that can be true reality in my mind</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="6.54">is that it comes from three basic places</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="4.49">being solo impressions which is that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.66" dur="4.26">your processing that&amp;#39;s what a</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="4.15">psychiatrist or psychologist was going</text>
  <text start="290.92" dur="3.57">to tell you of it you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="292.42" dur="6.3">processing and we do that we absolutely</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="6.36">do that but and some of the things that</text>
  <text start="298.72" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re processing through are connected</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="4.8">to woundings and other issues that are</text>
  <text start="303.37" dur="4.83">opposition that try to keep us from</text>
  <text start="305.65" dur="5.1">going forward in our life so I call that</text>
  <text start="308.2" dur="4.98">so impression but then there are tax</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="3.9">from the enemy which is that opposition</text>
  <text start="313.18" dur="2.91">that I&amp;#39;m talking about you know</text>
  <text start="314.65" dur="2.79">sometimes the enemy knows a lot more</text>
  <text start="316.09" dur="5.58">about who we are</text>
  <text start="317.44" dur="6.45">then really ourselves he he gets that</text>
  <text start="321.67" dur="4.59">better understanding sometimes as a DNA</text>
  <text start="323.89" dur="5.52">that gots placed with us within us and</text>
  <text start="326.26" dur="5.22">he&amp;#39;s fine as long as we don&amp;#39;t know who</text>
  <text start="329.41" dur="4.11">we are but as soon as we do know who we</text>
  <text start="331.48" dur="4.59">are that he knows can it get his teeth</text>
  <text start="333.52" dur="3.99">kicked in so finna get worried and in</text>
  <text start="336.07" dur="5.01">the third place that I think we</text>
  <text start="337.51" dur="5.79">obviously hear from is God that God is</text>
  <text start="341.08" dur="4.83">speaking all the time and he&amp;#39;s speaking</text>
  <text start="343.3" dur="7.44">through your dreams because that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="345.91" dur="14.16">place you&amp;#39;re not but you&amp;#39;re also not</text>
  <text start="350.74" dur="11.76">always going to understand the dream is</text>
  <text start="360.07" dur="4.26">a different language and that was what</text>
  <text start="362.5" dur="3.93">you know that&amp;#39;s what blew me away</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="3.86">is you know I hadn&amp;#39;t had dreams for a</text>
  <text start="366.43" dur="6.24">long time when I started having them I</text>
  <text start="368.19" dur="7.72">realized that this symbolic imagery that</text>
  <text start="372.67" dur="4.71">I was seeing in my dreams was sort of</text>
  <text start="375.91" dur="3.51">unique to me because I would talk to</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="3.78">other people who had dreams and they had</text>
  <text start="379.42" dur="3.29">dreams about different things like when</text>
  <text start="381.16" dur="3.96">denise is working as a graphic designer</text>
  <text start="382.71" dur="5.68">she would have a lot of dreams involving</text>
  <text start="385.12" dur="4.86">computers and software and things of</text>
  <text start="388.39" dur="4.65">that nature I had a lot of dreams</text>
  <text start="389.98" dur="5.31">involving ambulances and hospitals sure</text>
  <text start="393.04" dur="3.99">and isn&amp;#39;t a person&amp;#39;s dream language sort</text>
  <text start="395.29" dur="3.44">of unique to - they&amp;#39;re setting their</text>
  <text start="397.03" dur="5.37">life things that they&amp;#39;re familiar with</text>
  <text start="398.73" dur="6.58">you know is really good about I mean he</text>
  <text start="402.4" dur="5.01">does help you out and back he will use</text>
  <text start="405.31" dur="4.29">your colloquialism I mean he will he</text>
  <text start="407.41" dur="5.01">will use things that are in your</text>
  <text start="409.6" dur="5.19">reservoir you know he speaks like you</text>
  <text start="412.42" dur="5.01">speak sometimes but there are other</text>
  <text start="414.79" dur="4.71">times that because he has to hide things</text>
  <text start="417.43" dur="5.01">he wants you to sneak them out you know</text>
  <text start="419.5" dur="5.01">you have to you have to interact with</text>
  <text start="422.44" dur="4.14">him to seek those things out because</text>
  <text start="424.51" dur="4.26">he&amp;#39;s really the only one who knows right</text>
  <text start="426.58" dur="4.47">he&amp;#39;s the only one who knows the message</text>
  <text start="428.77" dur="4.68">knows the interpretation and knows what</text>
  <text start="431.05" dur="4.65">he&amp;#39;s saying so he likes for you to come</text>
  <text start="433.45" dur="5.67">and seek him looking for that that</text>
  <text start="435.7" dur="9.08">treasure he is not trying to hide from</text>
  <text start="439.12" dur="5.66">us he is trying to draw us closer to him</text>
  <text start="445.17" dur="40.05">in the good time to me you know I feel</text>
  <text start="481.78" dur="5.55">very fortunate because in a way I think</text>
  <text start="485.22" dur="4.54">God probably thinks I&amp;#39;m a little bit</text>
  <text start="487.33" dur="4.83">thick-headed and dumb because I get a</text>
  <text start="489.76" dur="5.49">lot of literal dreams I don&amp;#39;t have a lot</text>
  <text start="492.16" dur="4.05">of symbolic dreams compared to compared</text>
  <text start="495.25" dur="4.08">to a lot of people I mean you&amp;#39;ve heard</text>
  <text start="496.21" dur="5.49">some of my dreams and I get a lot of</text>
  <text start="499.33" dur="3.69">very literal dreams where what I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="501.7" dur="4.56">in the dream is what exactly what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="503.02" dur="5.43">supposed to be doing you know but those</text>
  <text start="506.26" dur="5.97">symbolic dreams are really interesting</text>
  <text start="508.45" dur="7.41">like and here&amp;#39;s an example I have had a</text>
  <text start="512.23" dur="6.66">lot of dreams involving warfare over the</text>
  <text start="515.86" dur="5.7">last five years in one dream I was being</text>
  <text start="518.89" dur="5.91">stalked by a sniper in another dream I</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="5.07">was with a group of soldiers and we are</text>
  <text start="524.8" dur="3.78">wearing like battle dress uniforms and</text>
  <text start="526.63" dur="4.29">and I&amp;#39;ve been in I&amp;#39;ve had dreams where</text>
  <text start="528.58" dur="3.3">I&amp;#39;ve been overseas on secret operations</text>
  <text start="530.92" dur="3.24">where I&amp;#39;m trying to hide from the enemy</text>
  <text start="531.88" dur="4.89">and set up like intelligence equipment</text>
  <text start="534.16" dur="5.88">behind enemy lines and the interesting</text>
  <text start="536.77" dur="7.38">thing is I really was not understanding</text>
  <text start="540.04" dur="7.8">those dreams very well until I saw the</text>
  <text start="544.15" dur="6.72">movie American sniper and when I saw</text>
  <text start="547.84" dur="5.49">that movie what happened was the whole</text>
  <text start="550.87" dur="5.01">spirit started to connect all these</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="5.43">dreams to scenes I had seen in the movie</text>
  <text start="555.88" dur="4.92">and he was showing me symbolically</text>
  <text start="558.76" dur="3.84">what these dreams were about and I</text>
  <text start="560.8" dur="3.75">started to understand what God was</text>
  <text start="562.6" dur="4.14">telling me about the enemy&amp;#39;s plans and</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="4.77">all that stuff and at that point I</text>
  <text start="566.74" dur="4.62">started to the revelation just sort of</text>
  <text start="569.32" dur="3.959">coming and coming and flowing and for</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="3.93">weeks I was getting revelation and</text>
  <text start="573.279" dur="3.961">understanding about these dreams that I</text>
  <text start="575.29" dur="4.98">did not understand up until that point</text>
  <text start="577.24" dur="5.49">and I actually wrote a book my latest</text>
  <text start="580.27" dur="4.259">book American sniper lessons in</text>
  <text start="582.73" dur="4.89">spiritual warfare is based off of a</text>
  <text start="584.529" dur="4.771">whole bunch of dreams ahead and how they</text>
  <text start="587.62" dur="3.81">tie into the scenes from the movie so</text>
  <text start="589.3" dur="5.13">kind of interesting how that all came</text>
  <text start="591.43" dur="5.31">together yeah and the right guy you know</text>
  <text start="594.43" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s a summation of these two you know</text>
  <text start="596.74" dur="5.7">I love that you know the matrix is such</text>
  <text start="599.5" dur="5.4">a good movie that oh my gosh right is</text>
  <text start="602.44" dur="4.29">where that cat walks by you know and</text>
  <text start="604.9" dur="4.86">it&amp;#39;s like a glitch in the program and</text>
  <text start="606.73" dur="5.46">and all of the group saying what did the</text>
  <text start="609.76" dur="5.49">cat walk by me walk by again exactly</text>
  <text start="612.19" dur="4.56">yeah why because that will happen even</text>
  <text start="615.25" dur="7.02">in your dream sometime and you&amp;#39;re like</text>

  <text start="760.13" dur="6.33">people they have night terrors before</text>
  <text start="762.89" dur="5.55">they have anything else right and it is</text>
  <text start="766.46" dur="4.59">interesting isn&amp;#39;t it how the enemy will</text>
  <text start="768.44" dur="4.11">come in and try to attack people and try</text>
  <text start="771.05" dur="3.06">to get them to shut down their dream</text>
  <text start="772.55" dur="5.19">life and not pay attention to their</text>
  <text start="774.11" dur="5.25">dreams in advance of God giving them</text>
  <text start="777.74" dur="5.19">destiny dreams and warning</text>
  <text start="779.36" dur="5.61">and strategic dreams it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="782.93" dur="4.649">the enemy&amp;#39;s trying to make a preemptive</text>
  <text start="784.97" dur="5.34">strike to get us to sort of shut down</text>
  <text start="787.579" dur="5.431">our ability to receive you know dreams</text>
  <text start="790.31" dur="4.92">from God right you&amp;#39;re absolutely right</text>
  <text start="793.01" dur="5.79">p.m. what he&amp;#39;s doing is he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="795.23" dur="5.58">get you to shut your eyes shut your eyes</text>
  <text start="798.8" dur="5.25">in your spiritual life so that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="800.81" dur="6.149">see where you&amp;#39;re going and who you are</text>
  <text start="804.05" dur="5.849">and if you can get you blinded where</text>
  <text start="806.959" dur="9">you&amp;#39;re intimidated and you&amp;#39;re afraid to</text>
  <text start="809.899" dur="8.641">look at your call because you show up</text>
  <text start="815.959" dur="15.601">and you do what you&amp;#39;re called to do then</text>
  <text start="818.54" dur="18.39">he can keep your shut down the power and</text>
  <text start="831.56" dur="8.31">the grace and the enabling to be able to</text>
  <text start="836.93" dur="4.83">fulfill what he&amp;#39;s told us to and the</text>
  <text start="839.87" dur="4.5">enemy is just telling us that so that he</text>
  <text start="841.76" dur="6.99">can just see this and shut us down right</text>
  <text start="844.37" dur="7.32">so got a question for you I I take a lot</text>
  <text start="848.75" dur="6.029">of requests from people through private</text>
  <text start="851.69" dur="5.69">messages to interpret dreams and one of</text>
  <text start="854.779" dur="5.87">the most common things that I see a</text>
  <text start="857.38" dur="5.62">symbolic element in a dream is a house</text>
  <text start="860.649" dur="4.601">people are living in different types of</text>
  <text start="863" dur="3.63">houses they go and they into the</text>
  <text start="865.25" dur="3.3">basement and they find something in the</text>
  <text start="866.63" dur="4.98">basement my son had a very interesting</text>
  <text start="868.55" dur="4.95">dream a couple of weeks ago where he was</text>
  <text start="871.61" dur="3.3">in his new apartment that he just rented</text>
  <text start="873.5" dur="3.779">it&amp;#39;s the actual apartment that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="874.91" dur="5.94">living in but there was a secret room</text>
  <text start="877.279" dur="5.341">off on the side and he was actually he</text>
  <text start="880.85" dur="4.02">said I felt like Jesus was there with me</text>
  <text start="882.62" dur="6.12">and he showed me this secret room and it</text>
  <text start="884.87" dur="5.76">was like a spa some people some people</text>
  <text start="888.74" dur="4.32">had dreams where they go up into hidden</text>
  <text start="890.63" dur="5.1">floors above the main level that they</text>
  <text start="893.06" dur="4.44">don&amp;#39;t know that we&amp;#39;re there so what</text>
  <text start="895.73" dur="4.38">generally speaking when people have</text>
  <text start="897.5" dur="4.23">these dreams about houses what is God</text>
  <text start="900.11" dur="10.55">talking about when he gives them these</text>
  <text start="901.73" dur="8.93">dreams well I don&amp;#39;t forget that</text>
  <text start="912.74" dur="6.45">there&amp;#39;s something also the house that</text>
  <text start="915.17" dur="6.6">you may currently live in then you would</text>
  <text start="919.19" dur="5.1">know this but but basically what God is</text>
  <text start="921.77" dur="6.21">doing is he&amp;#39;s inviting you into another</text>
  <text start="924.29" dur="6.75">realm another dimension something that</text>
  <text start="927.98" dur="4.89">you can&amp;#39;t see right right so the house</text>
  <text start="931.04" dur="4.32">but the house in a dream</text>
  <text start="932.87" dur="4.62">can&amp;#39;t get to basically depend you know</text>
  <text start="935.36" dur="4.919">there&amp;#39;s one thing about God and that is</text>
  <text start="937.49" dur="4.56">there is no methodology or formulas ever</text>
  <text start="940.279" dur="4.56">going to work right nothing is like</text>
  <text start="942.05" dur="4.86">written in stone it&amp;#39;s in concrete it</text>
  <text start="944.839" dur="2.611">sometimes it means this but sometimes it</text>
  <text start="946.91" dur="10.7">doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="947.45" dur="13.53">right right probably represent your</text>
  <text start="957.61" dur="5.65">generational issues and family life your</text>
  <text start="960.98" dur="5.43">bloodline in other words and God</text>
  <text start="963.26" dur="7.44">considers that property your bloodline</text>
  <text start="966.41" dur="11.16">he metaphorically would think of that</text>
  <text start="970.7" dur="9.99">like it&amp;#39;s land you know David the house</text>
  <text start="977.57" dur="4.829">of you know whatever the family is if</text>
  <text start="980.69" dur="3.66">it&amp;#39;s a house that you currently live in</text>
  <text start="982.399" dur="5.791">it&amp;#39;s going to relate to a structure</text>
  <text start="984.35" dur="6.75">sometimes or a covering that in your</text>
  <text start="988.19" dur="6.42">life that you&amp;#39;re dealing with and</text>
  <text start="991.1" dur="5.67">interfacing with today in this moment so</text>
  <text start="994.61" dur="4.349">it&amp;#39;s basically saying we&amp;#39;re in this</text>
  <text start="996.77" dur="5.67">moment that I&amp;#39;m showing you this message</text>
  <text start="998.959" dur="4.411">this message is not for what was not for</text>
  <text start="1002.44" dur="4.17">what&amp;#39;s to come</text>
  <text start="1003.37" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s for today it&amp;#39;s like a following one</text>
  <text start="1006.61" dur="4.86">what I call an information call saying</text>
  <text start="1009.16" dur="6.06">this is for now this is where you are</text>
  <text start="1011.47" dur="6.059">exactly if the house is non relative to</text>
  <text start="1015.22" dur="5.64">your current life and it&amp;#39;s not one that</text>
  <text start="1017.529" dur="8.011">you&amp;#39;ve ever lived in then it might be</text>
  <text start="1020.86" dur="7.38">about what you your your your whole life</text>
  <text start="1025.54" dur="5.25">in other words how you built that is</text>
  <text start="1028.24" dur="4.65">that something that&amp;#39;s been built with a</text>
  <text start="1030.79" dur="4.769">good foundation it&amp;#39;s healthy its</text>
  <text start="1032.89" dur="4.5">flourishing structure or is it one</text>
  <text start="1035.559" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s in disrepair and it&amp;#39;s falling</text>
  <text start="1037.39" dur="5.61">down that&amp;#39;s kind of that&amp;#39;s kind of the</text>
  <text start="1040.059" dur="5.191">way it worked so a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="1043" dur="3.43">dreams where they&amp;#39;re driving a car</text>
  <text start="1045.25" dur="4.21">Quorra</text>
  <text start="1046.43" dur="5.58">truck or they&amp;#39;re flying an airplane or</text>
  <text start="1049.46" dur="9.54">they&amp;#39;re in some kind of vehicle right</text>
  <text start="1052.01" dur="43.74">what do vehicles tend to recover driving</text>
  <text start="1059" dur="40.56">a vehicle we are specifically in say a</text>
  <text start="1095.75" dur="6.99">voluntary operation or you&amp;#39;re engaging</text>
  <text start="1099.56" dur="4.62">in some type of service in your church</text>
  <text start="1102.74" dur="3.66">for the elderly</text>
  <text start="1104.18" dur="4.86">you see Sunday school or you teach</text>
  <text start="1106.4" dur="5.79">school it could be about your occupation</text>
  <text start="1109.04" dur="5.96">it could be about your bent and wife or</text>
  <text start="1112.19" dur="5.6">it could be about you know what you do</text>
  <text start="1115" dur="5.53">you&amp;#39;ve read IRA Milligan&amp;#39;s book</text>
  <text start="1117.79" dur="4.57">understanding the dreams you dream yeah</text>
  <text start="1120.53" dur="3.66">one of the things I really liked about</text>
  <text start="1122.36" dur="4.05">that book and if you&amp;#39;re listening to</text>
  <text start="1124.19" dur="4.83">this on a podcast I&amp;#39;ll put links to the</text>
  <text start="1126.41" dur="5.94">resources that we recommend below the</text>
  <text start="1129.02" dur="6.18">podcast notes IRA Milligan&amp;#39;s book was</text>
  <text start="1132.35" dur="4.77">really interesting in that he suggested</text>
  <text start="1135.2" dur="3.84">that the structure of a dream if you</text>
  <text start="1137.12" dur="4.95">have let&amp;#39;s say a dream that has three</text>
  <text start="1139.04" dur="5.73">scenes that usually not all the time</text>
  <text start="1142.07" dur="4.68">usually the first scene of the dream</text>
  <text start="1144.77" dur="4.61">gives you the subject matter of the</text>
  <text start="1146.75" dur="6.18">dream the general overall subject and</text>
  <text start="1149.38" dur="5.8">the next two scenes will give you the</text>
  <text start="1152.93" dur="4.83">revelation that relates to that subject</text>
  <text start="1155.18" dur="5.4">do you find that to be generally a</text>
  <text start="1157.76" dur="4.95">pretty accurate way to look at dreams</text>
  <text start="1160.58" dur="3.72">and we&amp;#39;re gonna be going to break your</text>
  <text start="1162.71" dur="2.82">melody in just a minute so you can you</text>
  <text start="1164.3" dur="7.02">can give a short answer and then we can</text>
  <text start="1165.53" dur="9">pick up after the break okay that way</text>
  <text start="1171.32" dur="6.69">for me however the thing is usually in</text>
  <text start="1174.53" dur="5.67">that first paragraph or two yeah and</text>
  <text start="1178.01" dur="5.159">that&amp;#39;s been my experience normally if</text>
  <text start="1180.2" dur="6.299">if there&amp;#39;s a three scene dream for me</text>
  <text start="1183.169" dur="5.61">the first scene tends to speak of gods</text>
  <text start="1186.499" dur="4.591">this subject that he wants me to talk he</text>
  <text start="1188.779" dur="4.171">wants to speak to me about and then the</text>
  <text start="1191.09" dur="3.539">second dream gives it a little more or</text>
  <text start="1192.95" dur="3.829">the second dream or scene because a</text>
  <text start="1194.629" dur="5.25">little more revelation about a third one</text>
  <text start="1196.779" dur="8.801">puts a summary on the dream</text>
  <text start="1199.879" dur="7.351">it&amp;#39;s the resolution exactly yet it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1205.58" dur="3.229">it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s almost like a song how</text>
  <text start="1207.23" dur="4.23">you try to resolve the song at the end</text>
  <text start="1208.809" dur="5.141">it&amp;#39;s very interesting to me I love</text>

  <text start="1244.909" dur="42.09">is 602 277 5827 to you so I like to pray</text>
  <text start="1284.96" dur="4.829">every night before I go to sleep thank</text>
  <text start="1286.999" dur="6.3">to find my mind body soul and spirit and</text>
  <text start="1289.789" dur="5.671">ask him thanks by my imagination and to</text>
  <text start="1293.299" dur="4.38">bring my dreams and visions and night</text>
  <text start="1295.46" dur="4.74">experiences into alignment with his</text>
  <text start="1297.679" dur="5.61">purposes and I have come to release</text>
  <text start="1300.2" dur="5.729">things that are going to be strategy</text>
  <text start="1303.289" dur="6.12">that I need that are connected to my DNA</text>
  <text start="1305.929" dur="8.071">and what he&amp;#39;s basically created created</text>
  <text start="1309.409" dur="7.321">before and when we will always respond</text>
  <text start="1314" dur="5.13">he&amp;#39;s always listening yeah that&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1316.73" dur="4.68">my experience too I have found that you</text>
  <text start="1319.13" dur="7.67">know when I developed a nightly routine</text>
  <text start="1321.41" dur="9.6">of asking for dreams writing them down</text>
  <text start="1326.8" dur="6.97">journaling it does take a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1331.01" dur="4.44">discipline and I have found and I know</text>
  <text start="1333.77" dur="4.77">other people who have had the same issue</text>
  <text start="1335.45" dur="5.4">if you don&amp;#39;t journal your dreams and if</text>
  <text start="1338.54" dur="5.01">you don&amp;#39;t take them seriously it seems</text>
  <text start="1340.85" dur="5.49">like your dreams start to kind of drop</text>
  <text start="1343.55" dur="4.11">off but if your journaling them and if</text>
  <text start="1346.34" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re praying about them and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1347.66" dur="6.09">really seeking to understand them yeah</text>
  <text start="1350.33" dur="5.75">it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s to me it&amp;#39;s almost</text>
  <text start="1353.75" dur="5.22">like the concept of stewardship</text>
  <text start="1356.08" dur="5.74">Revelation is God asses to steward the</text>
  <text start="1358.97" dur="4.8">revelation he gives us and if you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1361.82" dur="12.42">good steward of what he gives you he</text>
  <text start="1363.77" dur="12.93">gives you more a very wonderful gift and</text>
  <text start="1374.24" dur="13.74">it&amp;#39;s a great way to hear from him</text>
  <text start="1376.7" dur="18.63">because it&amp;#39;s a very pure way future and</text>
  <text start="1387.98" dur="8.81">destiny into our spirits and yeah you</text>
  <text start="1395.33" dur="4.59">know it&amp;#39;s an interesting thing that</text>
  <text start="1396.79" dur="6.22">helped me relax a little bit about my</text>
  <text start="1399.92" dur="6.6">dreams because quite frankly I have some</text>
  <text start="1403.01" dur="6.24">bizarre dreams that I have no idea even</text>
  <text start="1406.52" dur="5.22">what was in the dream I&amp;#39;ve had these</text>
  <text start="1409.25" dur="5.22">dreams where I literally the only way I</text>
  <text start="1411.74" dur="5.7">can explain it is all night long my</text>
  <text start="1414.47" dur="4.62">spirit was receiving revelation from the</text>
  <text start="1417.44" dur="4.41">Holy Spirit it was like I was in the</text>
  <text start="1419.09" dur="5.85">Holy Spirit high school all night long I</text>
  <text start="1421.85" dur="7.17">had the spiritual downloads into my</text>
  <text start="1424.94" dur="5.7">spirit when I woke up I knew that I had</text>
  <text start="1429.02" dur="3.96">been receiving revelation all night long</text>
  <text start="1430.64" dur="4.95">I could not tell you a single thing that</text>
  <text start="1432.98" dur="5.22">I received it was just all locked up in</text>
  <text start="1435.59" dur="4.14">spiritual language I couldn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="1438.2" dur="3.75">it made no sense if it couldn&amp;#39;t tell you</text>
  <text start="1439.73" dur="3.72">what any of it was it&amp;#39;s easy to think</text>
  <text start="1441.95" dur="3.21">when you have those dreams I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1443.45" dur="4.35">remember anything about the dream I</text>
  <text start="1445.16" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t recall but but</text>
  <text start="1447.8" dur="6.09">dreams are purely for our spirit to be</text>
  <text start="1450.8" dur="5.73">edified and they&amp;#39;re not really for our</text>
  <text start="1453.89" dur="5.31">natural mind to understand mm-hmm it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1456.53" dur="7.35">my experience anyway so I&amp;#39;m gonna open</text>

  <text start="1695.239" dur="6.54">the revelation of but in the natural</text>
  <text start="1698.769" dur="4.63">would have been his future you know</text>
  <text start="1701.779" dur="4.98">could have connected to where he was</text>
  <text start="1703.399" dur="7.41">going but is probably connected to in</text>
  <text start="1706.759" dur="4.89">the spirit what he has experienced does</text>
  <text start="1710.809" dur="4.621">that make sense</text>

  <text start="1725.21" dur="3.349">French on the back of the photograph</text>

  <text start="1805.56" dur="4.77">and having visitations I have had a</text>
  <text start="1807.72" dur="3.33">number of visitations from people in</text>
  <text start="1810.33" dur="3.3">dreams</text>
  <text start="1811.05" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;ve had several visitations from Jesus</text>
  <text start="1813.63" dur="5.58">I had CS Lewis visit me in a dream not</text>
  <text start="1816.18" dur="4.74">too long ago oh my gosh it was so</text>
  <text start="1819.21" dur="4.02">amazing I think I need to tell people</text>
  <text start="1820.92" dur="3.66">about this dream so first of all you</text>
  <text start="1823.23" dur="3.63">have to understand that the book of</text>
  <text start="1824.58" dur="4.29">Hebrews says that we are surrounded by a</text>
  <text start="1826.86" dur="3.72">cloud of witnesses and some people</text>
  <text start="1828.87" dur="3.62">believe and I believe that the cloud of</text>
  <text start="1830.58" dur="4.71">witnesses is essentially an open</text>
  <text start="1832.49" dur="4.78">gathering of the saints who have</text>
  <text start="1835.29" dur="3.36">departed their physical bodies but</text>
  <text start="1837.27" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re still around in the in the</text>
  <text start="1838.65" dur="4.98">spiritual world and they are still able</text>
  <text start="1841.02" dur="5.67">to interact with people especially if</text>
  <text start="1843.63" dur="5.37">they you are someone who is walking in a</text>
  <text start="1846.69" dur="5.1">calling or a gifting similar to theirs</text>
  <text start="1849" dur="4.59">so I had this dream one night where CS</text>
  <text start="1851.79" dur="3.84">Lewis paid me a visit and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1853.59" dur="3.9">physically see him and I didn&amp;#39;t hear him</text>
  <text start="1855.63" dur="3.21">speaking it was spirit to spirit</text>
  <text start="1857.49" dur="3.57">communication so it was just the</text>
  <text start="1858.84" dur="3.87">transmission of thoughts he was telling</text>
  <text start="1861.06" dur="4.74">me that when he was alive he had some</text>
  <text start="1862.71" dur="5.94">problems with choices of words that he</text>
  <text start="1865.8" dur="5.43">used in his books and he was suggesting</text>
  <text start="1868.65" dur="5.22">to me that I should be very very careful</text>
  <text start="1871.23" dur="4.86">to pick the exact word to convey a</text>
  <text start="1873.87" dur="4.05">certain meaning because the choice of</text>
  <text start="1876.09" dur="4.26">one word or another makes a huge</text>
  <text start="1877.92" dur="4.44">difference in how readers perceive what</text>
  <text start="1880.35" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re trying to tell them and he gave</text>
  <text start="1882.36" dur="4.68">me some illustrations from his life ever</text>
  <text start="1884.4" dur="5.82">since I had that dream I have become</text>
  <text start="1887.04" dur="5.34">much more conscientious and I spend a</text>
  <text start="1890.22" dur="3.87">lot more time picking the correct words</text>
  <text start="1892.38" dur="4.59">when I&amp;#39;m writing a blog post or writing</text>
  <text start="1894.09" dur="5.37">a book it was just a very very amazing</text>
  <text start="1896.97" dur="4.98">instructive dream for me have you had</text>
  <text start="1899.46" dur="6.96">dreams like that that&amp;#39;s incredible yeah</text>
  <text start="1901.95" dur="8.16">I have what I love about that dream is</text>
  <text start="1906.42" dur="5.58">you know even in in dream interpretation</text>
  <text start="1910.11" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s the same way and the Lord has</text>
  <text start="1912" dur="4.62">spoken to me about that in your</text>
  <text start="1914.34" dur="5.939">interpretation the words that you used</text>
  <text start="1916.62" dur="5.97">are very important in conveying the</text>
  <text start="1920.279" dur="4.171">message that he&amp;#39;s giving which is why we</text>
  <text start="1922.59" dur="4.559">have to seek him about the message</text>
  <text start="1924.45" dur="5.579">rather than be talking out of our heads</text>
  <text start="1927.149" dur="5.551">and our knowledge so yeah that is a</text>
  <text start="1930.029" dur="4.981">great dream I have I&amp;#39;ve had dreams where</text>
  <text start="1932.7" dur="4.589">I&amp;#39;ve had lots of dreams where I&amp;#39;ve had</text>

  <text start="2091.55" dur="6.42">can wave that magic wand and make one</text>
  <text start="2094.369" dur="7.081">teaching about God disappear what one</text>
  <text start="2097.97" dur="6.96">teaching do you get rid of because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2101.45" dur="6.629">really a teaching I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2104.93" dur="6.24">almost like a teaching or a statement of</text>
  <text start="2108.079" dur="5.76">omission instead of direct statements</text>
  <text start="2111.17" dur="3.33">about God in other words where I came</text>
  <text start="2113.839" dur="4.381">from</text>
  <text start="2114.5" dur="7.829">the omission of speaking of God&amp;#39;s love</text>
  <text start="2118.22" dur="9.75">caused us to believe that God was more</text>
  <text start="2122.329" dur="8.28">interested in our needs and in</text>
  <text start="2127.97" dur="4.77">relationship with us that&amp;#39;s the thing I</text>
  <text start="2130.609" dur="6.201">wish I had been taught I wish I&amp;#39;d been</text>
  <text start="2132.74" dur="4.07">taught I was talking about relationship</text>
  <text start="2142.39" dur="5.05">yeah so was I which is why I became an</text>
  <text start="2145.55" dur="4.17">atheist because I thought well you know</text>
  <text start="2147.44" dur="10.11">who really needs a grumpy angry god I</text>
  <text start="2149.72" dur="9.119">mean I don&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s enough people in</text>
  <text start="2157.55" dur="3.09">the world that are having a bad day I</text>
  <text start="2158.839" dur="16.051">don&amp;#39;t need a god who&amp;#39;s having a bad day</text>
  <text start="2160.64" dur="16.77">I mean for pete&amp;#39;s sake you know a huge</text>
  <text start="2174.89" dur="8.91">heart he does it&amp;#39;s full</text>
  <text start="2177.41" dur="9.66">love for all of us he is a good daddy</text>
  <text start="2183.8" dur="5.73">oh man oh man and he loves good he loves</text>
  <text start="2187.07" dur="3.03">talking to us and he&amp;#39;ll do it any way he</text>
  <text start="2189.53" dur="2.79">can</text>
  <text start="2190.1" dur="4.68">so speaking of talking to us what do you</text>
  <text start="2192.32" dur="4.08">think is the one thing that kind of</text>
  <text start="2194.78" dur="14.52">hinders people from hearing God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="2196.4" dur="16.1">more clearly too busy yeah to busy to be</text>
  <text start="2209.3" dur="5.91">interested and to be speaking intimately</text>
  <text start="2212.5" dur="4.57">do you think that comes from how people</text>
  <text start="2215.21" dur="4.17">are treated by their relatives and</text>
  <text start="2217.07" dur="4.86">friends like if you assume that your</text>
  <text start="2219.38" dur="4.02">parents are too busy to be intimately</text>
  <text start="2221.93" dur="8.22">involved in your life maybe you assume</text>
  <text start="2223.4" dur="8.4">God&amp;#39;s the same way and you know how you</text>
  <text start="2230.15" dur="4.05">know by nature like we&amp;#39;re afraid to</text>
  <text start="2231.8" dur="13.71">trust it&amp;#39;s the same way with God it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2234.2" dur="15.03">like a personal experience with him in</text>
  <text start="2245.51" dur="5.43">relationship that we we hinder that and</text>
  <text start="2249.23" dur="6.9">we shut that down and we don&amp;#39;t get that</text>
  <text start="2250.94" dur="10.59">experience because we&amp;#39;re afraid that he</text>
  <text start="2256.13" dur="7.5">would be that harsh guard you know</text>
  <text start="2261.53" dur="10.77">because that&amp;#39;s the way my father was</text>
  <text start="2263.63" dur="10.56">sort of flesh he was kind of loud and do</text>
  <text start="2272.3" dur="4.77">you think a lot of people like</text>
  <text start="2274.19" dur="4.38">Christians are okay with Jesus and may</text>
  <text start="2277.07" dur="3.42">be okay with the Holy Spirit but that</text>
  <text start="2278.57" dur="3.93">father figure I&amp;#39;m not so sure about him</text>
  <text start="2280.49" dur="3.39">because if he&amp;#39;s anything like my earthly</text>
  <text start="2282.5" dur="6.09">father I don&amp;#39;t want anything to do with</text>
  <text start="2283.88" dur="8.75">him the orphan spirit essentially yeah</text>
  <text start="2288.59" dur="4.04">yeah it&amp;#39;s a huge it&amp;#39;s a huge issue</text>
  <text start="2296.92" dur="6.1">missing that infinite fellowship with</text>
  <text start="2300.28" dur="5.05">especially Holy Spirit because Jesus is</text>
  <text start="2303.02" dur="4.2">more you know accepted you know we hear</text>
  <text start="2305.33" dur="4.41">about Jesus we&amp;#39;re taught one of that</text>
  <text start="2307.22" dur="4.11">Jesus we know what Jesus did for us when</text>
