  <text start="23.82" dur="6.09">ever gonna return getting a lot of</text>
  <text start="26.609" dur="5.991">questions from people I&amp;#39;ve been doing a</text>
  <text start="29.91" dur="5.91">lot of research doing a lot of digging</text>
  <text start="32.6" dur="5.26">doing a lot of threads on Twitter trying</text>
  <text start="35.82" dur="3.3">to explain and kind of walk people</text>
  <text start="37.86" dur="4.379">through some of the stuff that&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="39.12" dur="5.34">on right now wanted to go back a little</text>
  <text start="42.239" dur="4.951">bit and cover something I have not</text>
  <text start="44.46" dur="10.05">covered yet on youtube or on the podcast</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="11.25">and that is this this reported memo that</text>
  <text start="54.51" dur="7.5">came out by the FBI supposedly from the</text>
  <text start="58.44" dur="7.59">Phoenix field office claiming that the</text>
  <text start="62.01" dur="9.71">FBI has categorized conspiracy theorists</text>
  <text start="66.03" dur="10.11">as a new category of domestic terrorism</text>
  <text start="71.72" dur="7.21">I did a ton of research on this subject</text>
  <text start="76.14" dur="4.83">a lot of digging this story was</text>
  <text start="78.93" dur="5.52">originally published by Yahoo News it</text>
  <text start="80.97" dur="4.8">then went out to ABC NBC CBS Wall Street</text>
  <text start="84.45" dur="3.51">Journal New York Times everybody</text>
  <text start="85.77" dur="4.77">published a story based on the story</text>
  <text start="87.96" dur="6.839">that was published by Yahoo Jenna winter</text>
  <text start="90.54" dur="7.17">is the writer of the article she also</text>
  <text start="94.799" dur="5.221">credited and Michael Isikoff for coming</text>
  <text start="97.71" dur="4.35">up with the lead on the story misuk off</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="7.559">of course was one of the first people</text>
  <text start="102.06" dur="7.89">who put out the steel dossier anyway I</text>
  <text start="107.579" dur="3.871">wanted to just bring people up to speed</text>
  <text start="109.95" dur="4.5">on what I found about that I contacted</text>
  <text start="111.45" dur="6.239">Jenna winter and I was concerned about</text>
  <text start="114.45" dur="7.769">this bulletin from the FBI supposedly</text>
  <text start="117.689" dur="6.54">from the FBI because they linked it to a</text>
  <text start="122.219" dur="6.63">Scribd account of a private individual</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="6.39">they did not link to a an FBI vault site</text>
  <text start="128.849" dur="4.081">or any government site</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="4.831">they had this document they said it was</text>
  <text start="132.93" dur="6.18">from the FBI</text>
  <text start="135.45" dur="8.64">they provided no evidence to suggest it</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="7.44">was an actual true FBI document and you</text>
  <text start="144.09" dur="4.2">know we we know that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="4.56">media has been doing everything they can</text>
  <text start="148.29" dur="4.559">to try to discredit Q&amp;amp;Q followers so</text>
  <text start="151.11" dur="3.599">that was a little bit suspicious of the</text>
  <text start="152.849" dur="4.351">story contacted Jenna winter through</text>
  <text start="154.709" dur="4.53">Twitter asked her she would give me a</text>
  <text start="157.2" dur="4.319">link to a government website or any</text>
  <text start="159.239" dur="3.961">evidence to corroborate her claim that</text>
  <text start="161.519" dur="3.571">this is a legitimate FBI document and</text>
  <text start="163.2" dur="6.599">she never responded to me that was</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="7.26">probably ten days ago so I did this</text>
  <text start="169.799" dur="5.19">thread I tagged Jenna winter I tagged</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="3.96">Isikoff none of them have responded to</text>
  <text start="174.989" dur="3.181">this they haven&amp;#39;t messaged me they</text>
  <text start="176.31" dur="4.98">haven&amp;#39;t responded on the thread and they</text>
  <text start="178.17" dur="6.06">haven&amp;#39;t written any articles responding</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="6.93">to my conclusions which I&amp;#39;ll share with</text>
  <text start="184.23" dur="5.759">you in just a few minutes so just wanted</text>
  <text start="188.22" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s a long thread I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="189.989" dur="5.881">go through everything in here it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="192.66" dur="4.77">a lot of videos in here videos of people</text>
  <text start="195.87" dur="4.53">from the FBI Department of Justice and</text>
  <text start="197.43" dur="5.61">Homeland Security talking about how they</text>
  <text start="200.4" dur="6.149">identify and how they classify domestic</text>
  <text start="203.04" dur="6.63">terror threats so the the relevant</text>
  <text start="206.549" dur="4.741">things are like I said I did a lot of</text>
  <text start="209.67" dur="4.379">research Jordan say there kind of did a</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="4.59">threat on this that it was actually what</text>
  <text start="214.049" dur="2.851">got me going he looked at the document</text>
  <text start="215.88" dur="5.16">and saw some things that were a little</text>
  <text start="216.9" dur="5.52">bit sketchy I also looked at it and saw</text>
  <text start="221.04" dur="3.029">some things that were sketchy this is</text>
  <text start="222.42" dur="6.27">the Scribd account where the document</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="7.531">was posted so and one thing I would</text>
  <text start="228.69" dur="4.199">point out is that when organizations</text>
  <text start="231.6" dur="3.65">like the American Center for Law and</text>
  <text start="232.889" dur="4.591">Justice and Judicial Watch they do</text>
  <text start="235.25" dur="4.12">investigative reporting when they</text>
  <text start="237.48" dur="3.539">provide intelligence products or</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="5.07">declassified government documents they</text>
  <text start="241.019" dur="7.261">always provide details on FOIA requests</text>
  <text start="244.44" dur="6.09">or any other means that they use to</text>
  <text start="248.28" dur="3.329">obtain non-public documents it&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="250.53" dur="4.639">the things that concerns me about this</text>
  <text start="251.609" dur="6.301">document is there isn&amp;#39;t and was no</text>
  <text start="255.169" dur="4.481">corroboration other than hey this thing</text>
  <text start="257.91" dur="4.04">is hosted on somebody&amp;#39;s private Scribd</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="2.3">account</text>
  <text start="262.32" dur="8.46">so I went to the FOIA website and when</text>
  <text start="268.26" dur="3.84">you are going to make a FOIA request the</text>
  <text start="270.78" dur="3.75">government asks you to do a search of</text>
  <text start="272.1" dur="3.45">its database for previously released</text>
  <text start="274.53" dur="3.96">documents</text>
  <text start="275.55" dur="5.52">through FOIA so I did a search and I</text>
  <text start="278.49" dur="4.1">used the first seven words in the title</text>
  <text start="281.07" dur="3.48">of this intelligence bulletin</text>
  <text start="282.59" dur="4.09">anti-government title of it is</text>
  <text start="284.55" dur="4.32">anti-government identity-based</text>
  <text start="286.68" dur="4.44">and fringe political conspiracy theories</text>
  <text start="288.87" dur="4.44">very likely motivate some domestic</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="5.07">extremists to commit criminal sometimes</text>
  <text start="293.31" dur="5.94">violent activity I took the first seven</text>
  <text start="296.19" dur="5.64">words and I used those in the FOIA</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="7.08">search and I came up with nothing there</text>
  <text start="301.83" dur="6.24">was no result on the FOIA search I tried</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="3.63">some other search terms things that were</text>
  <text start="308.07" dur="4.71">in the document I came up with nothing</text>
  <text start="309.96" dur="4.71">didn&amp;#39;t find anything I&amp;#39;ve also sent a</text>
  <text start="312.78" dur="4.74">FOIA request and I have gotten nothing</text>
  <text start="314.67" dur="5.43">back yet on the FOIA request and that</text>
  <text start="317.52" dur="6.09">was on August 2nd as when I sent out the</text>
  <text start="320.1" dur="5.64">FOIA request all right so you know you</text>
  <text start="323.61" dur="3.96">would think that an FBI intelligence</text>
  <text start="325.74" dur="3.18">bulletin if it had been obtained through</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="5.01">FOIA would probably show up in the</text>
  <text start="328.92" dur="6.36">database but it didn&amp;#39;t but that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.58" dur="4.17">mean it was not obtained through FOIA it</text>
  <text start="335.28" dur="5.91">just means that I was not able to find</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="7.38">it I contacted the Phoenix FBI field</text>
  <text start="341.19" dur="5.52">office and they referred me to their</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="5.79">national press office in DC or actually</text>
  <text start="346.71" dur="5.31">I guess it&amp;#39;s in probably lying Li anyway</text>
  <text start="349.92" dur="6.57">now this is a letter the email that was</text>
  <text start="352.02" dur="5.55">I was sent from Kelsey Pietra</text>
  <text start="356.49" dur="3.87">non-theatrical</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="4.23">Tenten how&amp;#39;re you say his name who was</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="3.48">from the FBI</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="4.77">he said that they didn&amp;#39;t they can</text>
  <text start="363.84" dur="5.94">neither confirm nor deny the legitimacy</text>
  <text start="366.57" dur="7.47">of that bulletin but he did send me</text>
  <text start="369.78" dur="9.69">links to four different things three of</text>
  <text start="374.04" dur="9.66">these links are two video testimony the</text>
  <text start="379.47" dur="6.36">first one is direct FBI director Chris</text>
  <text start="383.7" dur="4.86">Ray&amp;#39;s Senate Judiciary Oversight</text>
  <text start="385.83" dur="4.98">testimony on July 3rd 23rd so it was not</text>
  <text start="388.56" dur="4.17">that long ago and I found that to be</text>
  <text start="390.81" dur="3.819">very interesting there is also a</text>
  <text start="392.73" dur="4.269">counterterrorism division</text>
  <text start="394.629" dur="5.97">House Oversight meeting with Mike</text>
  <text start="396.999" dur="5.37">McGarrity he attended he is division</text>
  <text start="400.599" dur="5.421">assistant director of counterterrorism</text>
  <text start="402.369" dur="8.94">and then there was a third video</text>
  <text start="406.02" dur="9.009">McGarrity and a guy from DOJ he was</text>
  <text start="411.309" dur="6.06">national security to division Deputy</text>
  <text start="415.029" dur="4.23">Attorney General will get his name in a</text>
  <text start="417.369" dur="3.45">minute and then another guy from</text>
  <text start="419.259" dur="3.78">Homeland Security they all testified at</text>
  <text start="420.819" dur="4.62">this Homeland Security hearing then</text>
  <text start="423.039" dur="6.65">there was a fourth link that he sent me</text>
  <text start="425.439" dur="6.87">which was to a an official FBI website</text>
  <text start="429.689" dur="4.361">statement on the rise of domestic</text>
  <text start="432.309" dur="4.13">terrorism and how they categorize and</text>
  <text start="434.05" dur="7.519">classify domestic and foreign terrorism</text>
  <text start="436.439" dur="7.03">so the FBI few national press office</text>
  <text start="441.569" dur="5.25">again</text>
  <text start="443.469" dur="5.67">they said they do sometimes put out</text>
  <text start="446.819" dur="3.761">bulletins and notices for their law</text>
  <text start="449.139" dur="4.11">enforcement partners but they could not</text>
  <text start="450.58" dur="7.979">confirm or deny the authenticity of this</text>
  <text start="453.249" dur="8.52">bulletin so I did some I did some</text>
  <text start="458.559" dur="5.431">digging and the first video it was just</text>
  <text start="461.769" dur="5.1">kind of general interest Chris Rea well</text>
  <text start="463.99" dur="5.75">I was talking about the way that the FBI</text>
  <text start="466.869" dur="7.8">has changed since he came in as the</text>
  <text start="469.74" dur="7.599">director of the FBI in the second video</text>
  <text start="474.669" dur="4.52">that I posted ray responded to a</text>
  <text start="477.339" dur="6.901">question by dick Durbin who was</text>
  <text start="479.189" dur="9.01">expressing his concern about white</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="7.009">supremacist violence and you know I can</text>
  <text start="488.199" dur="5.28">probably get the one turned up here</text>
  <text start="491.249" dur="4.301">might be helpful to listen to this you</text>
  <text start="493.479" dur="4.68">talked about homegrown violent</text>
  <text start="495.55" dur="4.409">extremists and I talked about domestic</text>
  <text start="498.159" dur="5.76">violent extremists are we talking about</text>
  <text start="499.959" dur="6.57">the same thing no so we used the term</text>
  <text start="503.919" dur="4.58">homegrown violent extremism to refer to</text>
  <text start="506.529" dur="5.01">people already here in the United States</text>
  <text start="508.499" dur="5.14">who are inspired by different parts of</text>
  <text start="511.539" dur="5.31">the global jihadist movement to commit</text>
  <text start="513.639" dur="8.25">terrorist acts okay domestic terrorism</text>
  <text start="516.849" dur="8.751">to refer to a broader array of threats</text>
  <text start="521.889" dur="5.991">ranging from anarchist extremism</text>
  <text start="525.6" dur="4.89">two different kinds of racially</text>
  <text start="527.88" dur="4.56">motivated by extreme ism two different</text>
  <text start="530.49" dur="6.019">kinds of environmental my extreme</text>
  <text start="532.44" dur="6.69">assuming all right so in that discussion</text>
  <text start="536.509" dur="5.89">Chris ray described three of the four</text>
  <text start="539.13" dur="6.42">categories that the FBI now uses to</text>
  <text start="542.399" dur="8.841">categorize domestic violent extremism</text>
  <text start="545.55" dur="8.61">they only have four they categorize all</text>
  <text start="551.24" dur="5.95">racially motivated violent extremism</text>
  <text start="554.16" dur="7.02">together whether it&amp;#39;s and in this</text>
  <text start="557.19" dur="6.149">threaded I go into a and legitimate FBI</text>
  <text start="561.18" dur="5.19">bulletin that came out that identified</text>
  <text start="563.339" dur="5.821">black identity violence extremism this</text>
  <text start="566.37" dur="4.49">is a couple of years ago based on four</text>
  <text start="569.16" dur="4.02">shootings of law enforcement officers</text>
  <text start="570.86" dur="4.93">whether it&amp;#39;s white supremacists whether</text>
  <text start="573.18" dur="5.13">whatever anti-semitic it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="575.79" dur="4.409">if it&amp;#39;s racially motivated</text>
  <text start="578.31" dur="4.529">all of those are looked into one</text>
  <text start="580.199" dur="3.241">category racially motivated violent</text>
  <text start="582.839" dur="4.62">extremism</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="6.449">the second category they use is they</text>
  <text start="587.459" dur="4.291">have an abortion violent extremism</text>
  <text start="589.889" dur="5.82">believe it or not they have an</text>
  <text start="591.75" dur="10.29">environmental violent extremism and they</text>
  <text start="595.709" dur="9.331">have a anti-government and violent</text>
  <text start="602.04" dur="5.789">extremism and those are the only four</text>
  <text start="605.04" dur="5.099">categories that the FBI has to</text>
  <text start="607.829" dur="6.331">categorize domestic violent extremism</text>
  <text start="610.139" dur="7.31">they do not and through all these videos</text>
  <text start="614.16" dur="12.349">that I I posted they do not identify</text>
  <text start="617.449" dur="11.56">what this one bulletin claims which is</text>
  <text start="626.509" dur="6.611">anti-government identity based French</text>
  <text start="629.009" dur="10.401">political conspiracy extremism they have</text>
  <text start="633.12" dur="9.719">an anti government I think it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="639.41" dur="8.08">anarchist violent extremism but they do</text>
  <text start="642.839" dur="6.631">not identify a anti-government identity</text>
  <text start="647.49" dur="4.68">based French political conspiracy theory</text>
  <text start="649.47" dur="3.809">extremism not officially not on their</text>
  <text start="652.17" dur="3.96">website and I&amp;#39;ll show you that in just a</text>
  <text start="653.279" dur="4.941">second so I went through a lot of these</text>
  <text start="656.13" dur="5.15">videos and ray talks about</text>
  <text start="658.22" dur="5.34">in this this is a good example of</text>
  <text start="661.28" dur="8.7">something that Ray said here new</text>
  <text start="663.56" dur="12.75">philosophy by the FBI on elected</text>
  <text start="669.98" dur="7.92">officials and white supremacy belief I</text>
  <text start="676.31" dur="5.61">think it would be a version of that</text>
  <text start="677.9" dur="6.36">certainly we are focus when you asked</text>
  <text start="681.92" dur="5.22">about the categorization our focus is on</text>
  <text start="684.26" dur="5.58">the violence we don&amp;#39;t leave the FBI</text>
  <text start="687.14" dur="7.04">don&amp;#39;t investigate ideology no matter how</text>
  <text start="689.84" dur="7.83">repugnant we investigate violence and</text>
  <text start="694.18" dur="5.68">and I heard this repeatedly over and</text>
  <text start="697.67" dur="4.83">over and over again from Chris ray and</text>
  <text start="699.86" dur="4.17">from the people from the department of</text>
  <text start="702.5" dur="3.48">justice and homeland security they all</text>
  <text start="704.03" dur="3.99">said the same thing they do not</text>
  <text start="705.98" dur="4.95">investigate violence I&amp;#39;m sorry they</text>
  <text start="708.02" dur="4.77">don&amp;#39;t investigate ideology DOJ guy said</text>
  <text start="710.93" dur="5.82">they don&amp;#39;t prosecute ideology they</text>
  <text start="712.79" dur="5.4">prosecute violence and they are the FBI</text>
  <text start="716.75" dur="5.15">and Department of Justice really aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="718.19" dur="6.54">into identifying specific types of</text>
  <text start="721.9" dur="5.53">ideologies this is again talking about</text>
  <text start="724.73" dur="4.86">black identity extremism Cory Booker had</text>
  <text start="727.43" dur="3.99">some questions for Chris ray ray</text>
  <text start="729.59" dur="5.22">informed him look we don&amp;#39;t use black</text>
  <text start="731.42" dur="7.79">identity extremism anymore we categorize</text>
  <text start="734.81" dur="7.62">all of that into racially motivated</text>
  <text start="739.21" dur="8.76">violent extremism so this was a document</text>
  <text start="742.43" dur="8.28">that I found the FBI vault website I</text>
  <text start="747.97" dur="6.94">said it was a it was a Bolton that they</text>
  <text start="750.71" dur="6.72">put out two years ago 2017 based on four</text>
  <text start="754.91" dur="4.35">shootings on law enforcement that was</text>
  <text start="757.43" dur="4.77">they felt was motivated by black</text>
  <text start="759.26" dur="4.76">identity extremists right so the</text>
  <text start="762.2" dur="5.4">interesting thing about this document is</text>
  <text start="764.02" dur="6.96">it bears a lot of similarity to the</text>
  <text start="767.6" dur="6.33">document that Yahoo has reported on in</text>
  <text start="770.98" dur="8.07">fact it has some markings on it</text>
  <text start="773.93" dur="8.55">that are really difficult to explain</text>
  <text start="779.05" dur="7.41">where they would have come from so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="782.48" dur="7.06">see if I can get to DOJ and this is a</text>
  <text start="786.46" dur="6.95">fellow by the name of Wegman</text>
  <text start="789.54" dur="6.599">who was being asked about how does the</text>
  <text start="793.41" dur="4.95">DOJ prosecute violent crimes and how do</text>
  <text start="796.139" dur="7.01">they protect civil liberties and he</text>
  <text start="798.36" dur="8.49">talked about yeah there&amp;#39;s a the DOJ is</text>
  <text start="803.149" dur="5.981">up against a lot of restrictions because</text>
  <text start="806.85" dur="4.71">they have to guarantee the First</text>
  <text start="809.13" dur="3.99">Amendment right of people to speak to</text>
  <text start="811.56" dur="3.99">assemble and to have their own</text>
  <text start="813.12" dur="6.149">ideologies and DOJ does not interfere on</text>
  <text start="815.55" dur="7.38">that so that was a question that came</text>
  <text start="819.269" dur="4.921">out this gentleman representative McCall</text>
  <text start="822.93" dur="3.54">asked a good question</text>
  <text start="824.19" dur="4.11">former prosecutors said there are no</text>
  <text start="826.47" dur="3.69">criminal domestic terrorism charges</text>
  <text start="828.3" dur="4.019">currently that the DOJ can apply to a</text>
  <text start="830.16" dur="4.979">terrorist act and actually there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="832.319" dur="5.76">of discussion now in light of these</text>
  <text start="835.139" dur="7.731">shootings last weekend where people want</text>
  <text start="838.079" dur="7.95">to create domestic terrorism legislation</text>
  <text start="842.87" dur="8.019">the DOJ guy explained I think very</text>
  <text start="846.029" dur="8.391">interesting this hearing I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="850.889" dur="6.661">curious what your thoughts would be on</text>
  <text start="854.42" dur="15.039">Congress enacting a domestic terrorism</text>
  <text start="857.55" dur="15.69">charge and doing that take that</text>
  <text start="869.459" dur="15.481">so we we&amp;#39;re always looking to improve</text>
  <text start="873.24" dur="14.099">our authorities I think about exactly</text>
  <text start="884.94" dur="4.5">what issue you&amp;#39;re trying to fix as I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="887.339" dur="3.631">talked about in my opening testimony we</text>
  <text start="889.44" dur="4.11">do have a number of statutes that we use</text>
  <text start="890.97" dur="4.77">in these domestic terrorism cases so the</text>
  <text start="893.55" dur="4.769">question is what what gap would it fill</text>
  <text start="895.74" dur="3.719">exactly we probably would not want the</text>
  <text start="898.319" dur="3.27">one thing I would say something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="899.459" dur="3.721">similar to what we have on the</text>
  <text start="901.589" dur="3.961">international side which is designating</text>
  <text start="903.18" dur="3.839">foreign terrorist organizations we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="905.55" dur="3.149">not gonna want to for good policy</text>
  <text start="907.019" dur="3.51">reasons I think the Committee on both</text>
  <text start="908.699" dur="4.2">sides of the aisle will share more</text>
  <text start="910.529" dur="4.381">designating domestic groups as domestic</text>
  <text start="912.899" dur="2.761">terrorist organizations and picking out</text>
  <text start="914.91" dur="1.92">a particular group</text>
  <text start="915.66" dur="2.43">that you say you disagree with their</text>
  <text start="916.83" dur="3.18">views and so forth there&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="918.09" dur="3.78">highly problematic in a way that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="920.01" dur="2.79">when you&amp;#39;re designated al Qaeda or Isis</text>
  <text start="921.87" dur="4.47">or an international terrorist</text>
  <text start="922.8" dur="5.79">organization so so Brad what</text>
  <text start="926.34" dur="4.23">Wegman here pointed out that the</text>
  <text start="928.59" dur="5.13">difficulty with creating national</text>
  <text start="930.57" dur="5.52">domestic terrorism laws is that you have</text>
  <text start="933.72" dur="6.02">to identify certain groups certain</text>
  <text start="936.09" dur="6.15">ideologies that would be singled out</text>
  <text start="939.74" dur="5.56">identified as terrorist groups and then</text>
  <text start="942.24" dur="4.77">they would be prosecuted well no one is</text>
  <text start="945.3" dur="3.21">going to want their pet organization to</text>
  <text start="947.01" dur="3.48">be identified as a domestic terror</text>
  <text start="948.51" dur="4.83">organization which is why an Tifa has</text>
  <text start="950.49" dur="4.59">not been classified as a domestic terror</text>
  <text start="953.34" dur="5.85">organization because there aren&amp;#39;t any</text>
  <text start="955.08" dur="6.06">domestic terrorism laws in the same way</text>
  <text start="959.19" dur="6.75">that there are foreign terrorism laws</text>
  <text start="961.14" dur="8.07">the government can designate al-qaeda or</text>
  <text start="965.94" dur="5.79">Isis or other organizations as foreign</text>
  <text start="969.21" dur="5.13">domestic or sorry foreign terrorist</text>
  <text start="971.73" dur="4.86">organizations they can then apply</text>
  <text start="974.34" dur="6.39">economic sanctions they can prosecute</text>
  <text start="976.59" dur="5.55">them they use certain tools in the</text>
  <text start="980.73" dur="4.35">Justice Department that are not</text>
  <text start="982.14" dur="5.85">available for domestic terrorism because</text>
  <text start="985.08" dur="5.45">they they categorize them differently</text>
  <text start="987.99" dur="6.54">and they have different tools available</text>
  <text start="990.53" dur="5.41">all right so there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="994.53" dur="3.21">interesting discussion I was gonna see</text>
  <text start="995.94" dur="3.6">if I can find something that on this</text>
  <text start="997.74" dur="4.44">thread no I&amp;#39;m gonna go to the next</text>
  <text start="999.54" dur="2.94">threat they broke my thread in half all</text>
  <text start="1002.18" dur="3.57">right</text>
  <text start="1002.48" dur="5.67">so continuing along with this bulletin I</text>
  <text start="1005.75" dur="6.6">did a deep dive into the FBI</text>
  <text start="1008.15" dur="9.54">intelligence bulletin and I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="1012.35" dur="7.77">to state conclusively what I think about</text>
  <text start="1017.69" dur="6.81">this FBI bulletin that they published</text>
  <text start="1020.12" dur="6.68">however I will say this it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1024.5" dur="2.3">strange</text>
  <text start="1027.79" dur="7">first of all there&amp;#39;s a fact that the</text>
  <text start="1031.52" dur="5.01">bulletin was not hosted on a government</text>
  <text start="1034.79" dur="6.75">website it was hosted on someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1036.53" dur="8">private Scribd account the other thing</text>
  <text start="1041.54" dur="2.99">is that</text>
  <text start="1045.99" dur="9.1">let&amp;#39;s see well look at this in</text>
  <text start="1052.38" dur="4.54">declassified documents and this is an</text>
  <text start="1055.09" dur="5.76">example if you look at this and this is</text>
  <text start="1056.92" dur="8.91">a document that Q linked to this the</text>
  <text start="1060.85" dur="7.05">classified NSA document what I notice</text>
  <text start="1065.83" dur="5.64">and you can&amp;#39;t see that picture I guess</text>
  <text start="1067.9" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;ve got it but wherever there is a for</text>
  <text start="1071.47" dur="4.47">your eyes only</text>
  <text start="1072.4" dur="5.91">or a restriction to the public they</text>
  <text start="1075.94" dur="4.62">strike those up they do they put strike</text>
  <text start="1078.31" dur="5.28">throughs on them and you know maybe I</text>
  <text start="1080.56" dur="7.07">can bring this down so you can see it</text>
  <text start="1083.59" dur="7.65">you can see it they&amp;#39;re like secret</text>
  <text start="1087.63" dur="5.38">related to USA five eyes right strike</text>
  <text start="1091.24" dur="3.84">through for your eyes only strike</text>
  <text start="1093.01" dur="3.69">through anywhere in a document where</text>
  <text start="1095.08" dur="3.87">there are restrictions if it is a</text>
  <text start="1096.7" dur="4.37">legitimate government document they</text>
  <text start="1098.95" dur="4.2">usually do strike through whatever</text>
  <text start="1101.07" dur="5.8">classifying indicators are on the</text>
  <text start="1103.15" dur="5.37">document that is a good way to know that</text>
  <text start="1106.87" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;re looking at a legitimate</text>
  <text start="1108.52" dur="6.06">government document the document that</text>
  <text start="1111.76" dur="6.48">was provided by Yahoo has no strike</text>
  <text start="1114.58" dur="5.25">throughs on it now this is a it was an</text>
  <text start="1118.24" dur="3.36">FBI intelligence assessment was</text>
  <text start="1119.83" dur="4.62">published in 2017 I&amp;#39;m black at net</text>
  <text start="1121.6" dur="4.26">extremist you&amp;#39;ll notice it was four lon</text>
  <text start="1124.45" dur="3.36">it was law enforcement sensitive because</text>
  <text start="1125.86" dur="5.66">it was published for their law</text>

  <text start="1150.4" dur="3.03">here&amp;#39;s another page and that same</text>
  <text start="1151.93" dur="3.81">document you can see strike through law</text>

  <text start="1160.98" dur="4.99">let&amp;#39;s see go down here all right some of</text>
  <text start="1165.01" dur="4.86">the things that I just found I found</text>
  <text start="1165.97" dur="8.85">very interesting and I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="1169.87" dur="7.45">belabor this point too much on the FBI</text>
  <text start="1174.82" dur="4.75">bulletin about</text>
  <text start="1177.32" dur="3.96">black identity extremism I found</text>
  <text start="1179.57" dur="4.56">something interesting at the bottom of</text>
  <text start="1181.28" dur="5.37">the document there is a there was a</text>
  <text start="1184.13" dur="5.46">customer service satisfaction survey</text>
  <text start="1186.65" dur="6.39">right and this is it and what I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1189.59" dur="6.33">noticed is that the box is to check the</text>
  <text start="1193.04" dur="4.95">make your selection overlap the words by</text>
  <text start="1195.92" dur="4.5">one or two letters this is integrate</text>
  <text start="1197.99" dur="4.65">this is incorporate and you can see the</text>
  <text start="1200.42" dur="4.38">other words below the second line down</text>
  <text start="1202.64" dur="4.32">on the left is share contents that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1204.8" dur="5.22">below that is share with my organization</text>
  <text start="1206.96" dur="4.62">below that is improve a situational</text>
  <text start="1210.02" dur="4.14">awareness and there&amp;#39;s a letter or two</text>
  <text start="1211.58" dur="6.15">that are obscured by the selection boxes</text>
  <text start="1214.16" dur="7.14">on all of these selections right you can</text>
  <text start="1217.73" dur="6.66">see on both columns there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1221.3" dur="5.82">obscured partially obscured why is it</text>
  <text start="1224.39" dur="4.86">relevant well here&amp;#39;s another thing I</text>
  <text start="1227.12" dur="3.96">noticed if you take this is again from</text>
  <text start="1229.25" dur="4.02">the black identity extremism bulletin</text>
  <text start="1231.08" dur="4.86">you take a vertical line and strike it</text>
  <text start="1233.27" dur="3.9">all the way through the document and put</text>
  <text start="1235.94" dur="2.94">it through the center of the number one</text>
  <text start="1237.17" dur="4.83">the number two and number three sections</text>
  <text start="1238.88" dur="6.12">on the customer satisfaction survey you</text>

  <text start="1247.88" dur="4.65">left of the plumb line and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1249.26" dur="5.7">actually off the page the numbers are so</text>
  <text start="1252.53" dur="6.12">this document when it was scanned</text>
  <text start="1254.96" dur="5.88">I&amp;#39;m guessing got somewhat there was some</text>
  <text start="1258.65" dur="3.96">scanner artifact that caused these</text>
  <text start="1260.84" dur="5.58">numbers to be sectioned we moved over</text>
  <text start="1262.61" dur="7.68">and caused these boxes to be to overlap</text>
  <text start="1266.42" dur="7.26">these words okay again I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="1270.29" dur="4.8">analyzing this and that it looks like</text>
  <text start="1273.68" dur="3.18">when they scan this document there were</text>
  <text start="1275.09" dur="3.99">some irregularities there&amp;#39;s no way this</text>
  <text start="1276.86" dur="4.95">document would have been made with these</text>
  <text start="1279.08" dur="6.02">boxes overlapping half of these words I</text>
  <text start="1281.81" dur="3.29">mean it just doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="1285.89" dur="6.57">interesting also on this black identity</text>
  <text start="1287.84" dur="9.05">extremism document at the bottom Rev dot</text>
  <text start="1292.46" dur="9.15">28 August 2013 product serial number is</text>

  <text start="1309.41" dur="4.68">the intelligence bulletin that</text>
  <text start="1311.12" dur="4.59">provided by Yahoo one of the things I</text>
  <text start="1314.09" dur="4.02">noticed said that where it says law</text>
  <text start="1315.71" dur="4.59">enforcement sensitive for official use</text>
  <text start="1318.11" dur="4.699">only none of those have strike throughs</text>
  <text start="1320.3" dur="5.91">on them not any of them and that is</text>
  <text start="1322.809" dur="5.971">problematic if this document has was</text>
  <text start="1326.21" dur="6.42">originally designed for law enforcement</text>

  <text start="1335.98" dur="5.92">that&amp;#39;s a problem and again it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1340.4" dur="3.24">prove anything that these are not don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1341.9" dur="4.47">have strike throughs but it&amp;#39;s concerning</text>

  <text start="1354.64" dur="7.03">let&amp;#39;s see the I&amp;#39;m gonna get down to</text>
  <text start="1359.9" dur="4.8">something that I think all right so this</text>
  <text start="1361.67" dur="5.79">is the customer satisfaction survey on</text>
  <text start="1364.7" dur="6.51">the bottom of the document that yahoo</text>

  <text start="1396.2" dur="11.04">I found that highly interesting let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1547.769" dur="7.07">problems I&amp;#39;m just gonna put this out of</text>
  <text start="1550.469" dur="7.26">before I go if you go to the FBI news</text>
  <text start="1554.839" dur="5.19">where they&amp;#39;ve got different documents on</text>
  <text start="1557.729" dur="5.221">the FBI website this particular page</text>
  <text start="1560.029" dur="4.48">describes how the FBI classifies</text>
  <text start="1562.95" dur="3.75">domestic terrorism threats they have</text>
  <text start="1564.509" dur="4.83">four categories and listen to all these</text>
  <text start="1566.7" dur="4.319">videos over and over and over again FBI</text>
  <text start="1569.339" dur="4.08">Department of Justice Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="1571.019" dur="4.62">all use the same four categories all</text>
  <text start="1573.419" dur="4.221">said they don&amp;#39;t investigate or prosecute</text>
  <text start="1575.639" dur="4.891">ideology</text>
  <text start="1577.64" dur="5.17">they identify racially-motivated violent</text>
  <text start="1580.53" dur="4.53">extremism anti-government anti-authority</text>
  <text start="1582.81" dur="3.99">extremism animal rights environmental</text>
  <text start="1585.06" dur="3.02">extremism and abortion extremism those</text>
  <text start="1586.8" dur="5.1">are the only four categories they have</text>
  <text start="1588.08" dur="7.9">for domestic violent extremism they do</text>
  <text start="1591.9" dur="7.92">not identify political conspiracy fringe</text>
  <text start="1595.98" dur="5.46">political conspiracy extremism that is</text>
  <text start="1599.82" dur="4.86">not one of their categories so the fact</text>
  <text start="1601.44" dur="7.05">that this document creates a new</text>
  <text start="1604.68" dur="6.66">category that the FBI has not officially</text>
  <text start="1608.49" dur="5.79">identified is another red flag for me I</text>
  <text start="1611.34" dur="6.45">just doesn&amp;#39;t pass the sniff test so</text>
  <text start="1614.28" dur="5.73">anyway that is my dot deep dive on that</text>
  <text start="1617.79" dur="6.6">FBI document that Yahoo put out there</text>
  <text start="1620.01" dur="8.43">moving along a lot of people have been</text>
  <text start="1624.39" dur="6.78">asking if Q&amp;#39;s absence and the removal of</text>
  <text start="1628.44" dur="5.37">8chan from the internet is the ten days</text>
  <text start="1631.17" dur="7.77">of darkness that Q has referred to I do</text>
  <text start="1633.81" dur="8.37">not think that is the case the reason I</text>
  <text start="1638.94" dur="6.66">do not think that is a case is because</text>
  <text start="1642.18" dur="5.01">the ten days of darkness obviously was Q</text>
  <text start="1645.6" dur="4.35">predicting something that was about to</text>
  <text start="1647.19" dur="5.07">happen and in the question and answer</text>
  <text start="1649.95" dur="4.14">session from December of last year one</text>
  <text start="1652.26" dur="7.1">of the anons asked you how do you know</text>
  <text start="1654.09" dur="8.04">the future Hugh said ctrl Q is able to</text>
  <text start="1659.36" dur="5.2">correctly predict some future events</text>
  <text start="1662.13" dur="5.22">because Q and the president and their</text>
  <text start="1664.56" dur="4.68">team they control the timing of things</text>
  <text start="1667.35" dur="3.93">like military operations and the release</text>
  <text start="1669.24" dur="3.63">of executive orders you can accurately</text>
  <text start="1671.28" dur="4.26">predict the release of an executive</text>
  <text start="1672.87" dur="4.32">order if you know the President and you</text>
  <text start="1675.54" dur="4.17">know when he&amp;#39;s going to release it right</text>
  <text start="1677.19" dur="4.77">so they have control over certain things</text>
  <text start="1679.71" dur="6.51">which is how they can predict those</text>
  <text start="1681.96" dur="6.21">events but Q does not generally predict</text>
  <text start="1686.22" dur="6.74">things which they don&amp;#39;t have control of</text>
  <text start="1688.17" dur="4.79">all right</text>
  <text start="1693.47" dur="5.26">so I think a more likely interpretation</text>
  <text start="1696.81" dur="4.2">of the ten days of darkness would be a</text>
  <text start="1698.73" dur="5.52">period of time when Q was not going to</text>
  <text start="1701.01" dur="5.19">post for 10 days and Q knew there was</text>
  <text start="1704.25" dur="3.66">going to be a 10 day period when he</text>
  <text start="1706.2" dur="3.57">would not post and he would have direct</text>
  <text start="1707.91" dur="3.87">control over that and actually that</text>
  <text start="1709.77" dur="6.45">period of 10 days happened between</text>
  <text start="1711.78" dur="7.53">December 25th in January 4th there were</text>
  <text start="1716.22" dur="4.89">10 days there or there weren&amp;#39;t any posts</text>
  <text start="1719.31" dur="5.16">on the tenth day Q came back in January</text>
  <text start="1721.11" dur="6.75">4th if you count the last post on the</text>
  <text start="1724.47" dur="7.38">25th 26 27 28 just count forward you get</text>
  <text start="1727.86" dur="7.02">10 days interesting on December 25th Q</text>
  <text start="1731.85" dur="7.74">posted this post this was the last post</text>
  <text start="1734.88" dur="7.95">before going silent 10 10 9 what follows</text>
  <text start="1739.59" dur="6.63">9 8 7 6 5 4 I think it was a countdown</text>
  <text start="1742.83" dur="5.88">and I think Q was telling us the 10 day</text>
  <text start="1746.22" dur="5.13">countdown was going to start on 25th and</text>
  <text start="1748.71" dur="3.54">then ten days later Q came back on</text>
  <text start="1751.35" dur="2.64">January 4th</text>
  <text start="1752.25" dur="5.49">I think that was actually the 10 days of</text>
  <text start="1753.99" dur="5.97">darkness and there may have been a</text>
  <text start="1757.74" dur="4.35">second 10 days of darkness in December</text>
  <text start="1759.96" dur="3.42">if you go back and look at the post from</text>
  <text start="1762.09" dur="3.69">December you&amp;#39;ll find some very</text>
  <text start="1763.38" dur="9.5">interesting things anyway not going to</text>
  <text start="1765.78" dur="7.1">belabor that point I will say this</text>
  <text start="1772.97" dur="8.41">moving over to the next one let&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1777.57" dur="5.19">talk about this real quick so people</text>
  <text start="1781.38" dur="3.93">have been wondering what the heck is</text>
  <text start="1782.76" dur="10.22">happening to a Qian and what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="1785.31" dur="11.34">with with Q net posting so 8chan lost</text>
  <text start="1792.98" dur="5.05">the support from several of the tech</text>
  <text start="1796.65" dur="4.35">companies that were providing them</text>
  <text start="1798.03" dur="6.81">support because of political pressure</text>

  <text start="1818.13" dur="3.12">support them anymore they got another</text>
  <text start="1819.45" dur="5.31">company and that company got a platform</text>
  <text start="1821.25" dur="5.07">so there&amp;#39;s been this ongoing war trying</text>
  <text start="1824.76" dur="6.72">to take out HN</text>
  <text start="1826.32" dur="7.47">I think mostly because ki was supposed</text>

  <text start="1837.9" dur="4.17">screaming and hollering to get 4chan do</text>
  <text start="1840.3" dur="5.43">platform - it&amp;#39;s all about taking down HN</text>

  <text start="1874.98" dur="8.51">testify 8chan is working on getting the</text>
  <text start="1880.13" dur="7.95">HN website back online</text>
  <text start="1883.49" dur="7.39">I believe that when HN gets back online</text>
  <text start="1888.08" dur="3.99">he will start posting again they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1890.88" dur="4.71">working on it right now</text>

  <text start="1945.39" dur="6.93">I believe Q will start posting in they</text>
  <text start="1948.24" dur="6.27">need to figure out how to basically</text>
  <text start="1952.32" dur="5.85">create a system that is not going to be</text>
  <text start="1954.51" dur="8.1">subject to these attacks in the future</text>
  <text start="1958.17" dur="6.75">one thing to notice is people have been</text>
  <text start="1962.61" dur="5.34">saying that HN was set up on zero net</text>
  <text start="1964.92" dur="8.22">and code monkey wanted everyone to know</text>
  <text start="1967.95" dur="7.77">they did not set up that network on zero</text>
  <text start="1973.14" dur="4.23">net and he has advised just gonna advise</text>
  <text start="1975.72" dur="3.3">people to stay away from it until we</text>
  <text start="1977.37" dur="4.5">figure out and till we get official word</text>
  <text start="1979.02" dur="7.05">from 8chan or from code monkey I would</text>
  <text start="1981.87" dur="6.99">not try to access a Chan on any platform</text>
  <text start="1986.07" dur="5.04">that they&amp;#39;re working on it and like I</text>
  <text start="1988.86" dur="4.95">said I think when they get this all</text>
  <text start="1991.11" dur="9.56">worked out Q will be back so nothing to</text>
  <text start="1993.81" dur="11.16">freak out about okay now let&amp;#39;s do this</text>
  <text start="2000.67" dur="9.82">so Jeffrey Epstein was reported to be</text>
  <text start="2004.97" dur="7.83">found dead this morning and people are</text>
  <text start="2010.49" dur="4.32">kind of a little bit concerned what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2012.8" dur="4.83">going on what happened is he really dead</text>
  <text start="2014.81" dur="5.04">did they sneak him out suicide isn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="2019.85" dur="3.93">whole lot I will give you the</text>
  <text start="2021.17" dur="5.82">information that I&amp;#39;ve got one thing I</text>
  <text start="2023.78" dur="6.54">think that&amp;#39;s worth looking at is let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2026.99" dur="8.31">see I wanted to Attorney General William</text>
  <text start="2030.32" dur="6.48">bar has launched two investigations he</text>
  <text start="2035.3" dur="3.9">is launching an investigation into the</text>
  <text start="2036.8" dur="4.83">death of Epstein he has also asked the</text>
  <text start="2039.2" dur="5.07">inspector general to look into Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2041.63" dur="3.96">death to find out what happened because</text>
  <text start="2044.27" dur="4.5">he was supposed to be on suicide watch</text>
  <text start="2045.59" dur="5.63">right so their investigations going also</text>
  <text start="2048.77" dur="5.52">there&amp;#39;s a statement this morning from</text>

  <text start="2064.99" dur="6.4">they&amp;#39;re going to continue researching</text>
  <text start="2067.25" dur="10.649">now the last thing I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="2071.39" dur="10.2">is does what does it mean that Epstein</text>
  <text start="2077.899" dur="5.221">is no longer available to testify well I</text>
  <text start="2081.59" dur="3.24">would like to suggest that it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2083.12" dur="5.85">mean really anything at all to the case</text>
  <text start="2084.83" dur="5.4">probably and the reason I say that is Q</text>

  <text start="2342.14" dur="3.36">important note that after Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2343.4" dur="3.72">death no one else would have standing to</text>
  <text start="2345.5" dur="3.48">challenge the search warrant on his</text>
  <text start="2347.12" dur="3.75">house everything will be admissible</text>

  <text start="2350.87" dur="4.62">possibility of a motion to suppress</text>
  <text start="2352.67" dur="6.73">so maybe prosecutors will actually have</text>
  <text start="2355.49" dur="6.309">an easier time getting that evidence at</text>
  <text start="2359.4" dur="4.82">mitad into this case now that Epstein</text>
  <text start="2361.799" dur="5.371">can&amp;#39;t his attorneys can object anything</text>
