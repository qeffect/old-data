  <text start="826.71" dur="0.76">did you</text>
  <text start="827.47" dur="4.17">is to let him challenger soul in quit
compromising</text>
  <text start="831.64" dur="3">to white guy can do because what people
have told you</text>
  <text start="836.21" dur="4.02">I we&amp;#39;re gonna look at one other example
term with me to Matthew chapter 17</text>
  <text start="841.81" dur="3.279">this is why I called the contrast models</text>
  <text start="845.089" dur="3.101">ministry without revelation contrast</text>
  <text start="848.19" dur="3.12">models a ministry without revelation
where we&amp;#39;re going to do is like an</text>
  <text start="851.31" dur="1.66">example love it here</text>
  <text start="852.97" dur="3.13">I wanna why my building towards this
direction because</text>
  <text start="856.1" dur="3.83">on there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a thing that I
talked about when I started</text>
  <text start="859.93" dur="4.19">that i were really wanna kinda hit the
nail on the head this time with</text>
  <text start="864.779" dur="3.241">very important and we understand this
you and I</text>
  <text start="868.02" dur="3.69">God has what we would call a learning a
training dynamic</text>
  <text start="871.71" dur="4.33">his presence that he teaches you some
have you got it from Pentecostalism so</text>
  <text start="876.04" dur="0.87">many you got it from</text>
  <text start="876.91" dur="4.22">charismatic moment I I got it from the
vineyard movement or the third wave</text>
  <text start="881.13" dur="3.67">so all a lot of us have had teachers in
front of a showing us how to do ministry</text>
  <text start="884.8" dur="1.36">this is how the Lord comes</text>
  <text start="886.16" dur="3">this is what it looks like and weak we
develop a model</text>
  <text start="889.91" dur="3.88">alright now with that being said let&amp;#39;s
look at the store and i wanna show you</text>
  <text start="893.79" dur="2.14">how Jesus trying to deal with this</text>
  <text start="895.93" dur="3.8">have you heard mickey&amp;#39;s message last
night he talked about the</text>
  <text start="899.73" dur="1">Transfiguration</text>
  <text start="900.73" dur="3.02">over can actually pick up right after
the Transfiguration</text>
  <text start="903.75" dur="4.399">in going to this this teaching so let&amp;#39;s
look at Matthew chapter 17 first 14 to</text>
  <text start="908.149" dur="1.831">21</text>
  <text start="909.98" dur="3.01">does this I&amp;#39;m and when they it calm</text>
  <text start="912.99" dur="3.909">a I&amp;#39;m sorry I think I&amp;#39;m going okay
suggests is talking to her about</text>
  <text start="917.95" dur="3.78">Elijah and him coming and I&amp;#39;m not
understanding it many says this</text>
  <text start="921.73" dur="3.91">and when they had camped to the
multitudes a man man came to him now</text>
  <text start="925.64" dur="3.24">before him saying Lord have mercy on my
son for his</text>
  <text start="928.88" dur="3.76">epileptic answer for severely any of it
falls into the fire</text>
  <text start="932.64" dur="3.44">and often in the water so I brought into
your disciples but they could not</text>
  <text start="936.08" dur="3.84">sure him jesus answered and said to them</text>
  <text start="939.92" dur="4.609">all faithless and perverse generation
how long shall I be with you on how long</text>
  <text start="944.529" dur="1.531">show I bear with you</text>
  <text start="946.06" dur="4.05">bring him here to me Jesus rebuked the
demand it came out when the child was</text>
  <text start="950.11" dur="1.94">cured from that very hour</text>
  <text start="952.05" dur="4.03">then the disciples came to Jesus priming
said what why can&amp;#39;t we cast a doubt not</text>
  <text start="956.08" dur="3.379">you guys ever run into this experience</text>
  <text start="959.459" dur="3">you&amp;#39;re trained to do ministry and
nothing happens</text>
  <text start="963.36" dur="3">okay let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s keep going on</text>
  <text start="967.029" dur="3">so Jesus said to them has a beer
unbelief</text>
  <text start="971.37" dur="4.08">for a surely I say to you if your faith
is as a mustard seed you say to this</text>
  <text start="975.45" dur="2.15">mountain move from here to there</text>
  <text start="977.6" dur="3">and it will move and nothing will be
impossible for you however</text>
  <text start="981.24" dur="3.56">this kind does not come out without
prayer and fasting</text>
  <text start="985.39" dur="3.389">RN um loose translation it just says by
prayer</text>
  <text start="989.86" dur="3.039">okay now lets developers</text>
  <text start="992.899" dur="3.401">right so these three guys are coming
down the mountain side they they</text>
  <text start="996.3" dur="3">as make you say last night wanted to
build three churches</text>
  <text start="1000.19" dur="3.83">the calm down the mountainside I find it
fascinating that as are coming down the</text>
  <text start="1004.02" dur="3.28">mountain side they do not understand
scriptures a Jesus is explained in</text>
  <text start="1007.3" dur="1.659">Scripture the interpreter wrong</text>
  <text start="1008.959" dur="3.94">so is helping him to interpret it
correctly they come to the disciples the</text>
  <text start="1012.899" dur="1.201">ciphers are struggling</text>
  <text start="1014.1" dur="3.239">nine of them trying to cast demand out a
kid</text>
  <text start="1018.61" dur="3.83">now what is going on in the passage that
we need to look at a couple things</text>
  <text start="1023.23" dur="3.309">how long the disciples been with Jesus
up to this point about a year</text>
  <text start="1026.539" dur="3.25">it already learned how to preach the
gospel heal the sick cast out demons</text>
  <text start="1029.789" dur="1.35">raise the dead and do</text>
  <text start="1031.139" dur="3.331">claims leopards so why can they not cast
the demand on the kid</text>
  <text start="1035.679" dur="4.15">I used to read a passage in think
four-year you&amp;#39;re really intense here or</text>
  <text start="1039.829" dur="3.5">wire you review can these people that
are trying to cast out demons by the way</text>
  <text start="1043.329" dur="3.12">when he said all unbelieving and
perverse generation he was not talking</text>
  <text start="1046.449" dur="1.87">to the crowd</text>
  <text start="1048.319" dur="3.381">who&amp;#39;s talking to the disciples I would
you guys like to have a</text>
  <text start="1051.7" dur="4.059">military experience for the word comes
and says hey you unbelieving traversed</text>
  <text start="1055.759" dur="2.701">disciple when their vehicle</text>
  <text start="1058.46" dur="3.839">now the word perverse here does not mean
sexual perversion</text>
  <text start="1062.989" dur="3.57">the word per first means twisted from
the norm</text>
  <text start="1068.33" dur="3.01">it so they were unbelieving and twisted
from the norm</text>
  <text start="1072.489" dur="3.451">okay not that that&amp;#39;s the problem K so
Jesus</text>
  <text start="1075.94" dur="3.91">into cast at the demon in the country
nickel why couldn&amp;#39;t we do it</text>
  <text start="1080.82" dur="4.309">I get this why can&amp;#39;t they do it how many
times have I pray for someone and</text>
  <text start="1085.129" dur="3.61">and I feel the presence of the Lord
there and then when I pray for nothing</text>
  <text start="1088.739" dur="3.29">happens and I&amp;#39;m wife at the Warren go
why I could I not</text>
  <text start="1092.029" dur="3.15">do it and let&amp;#39;s look and see how he
talks to me about</text>
  <text start="1095.179" dur="5.291">first thing we want to look a Jesus
connects it with a reality that you and</text>
  <text start="1100.47" dur="1.689">i have to understand from his</text>
  <text start="1102.159" dur="3.97">his perspective K first one is the sea</text>
  <text start="1106.129" dur="3.221">he says ur I&amp;#39;m believing so let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s
look at that we&amp;#39;re just for a moment</text>
  <text start="1110.049" dur="3">everyone always thinks I&amp;#39;m believing me
something I have to produce</text>
  <text start="1113.889" dur="3.27">K I&amp;#39;m unbelieving that&amp;#39;s what the words
nailing me on</text>
  <text start="1117.159" dur="3.061">so are they I&amp;#39;m believing they don&amp;#39;t
believe there&amp;#39;s a god no</text>
  <text start="1120.22" dur="3.63">they&amp;#39;re not talking about that by the
way I guess I need a kind introduces to</text>
  <text start="1123.85" dur="0.709">you</text>
  <text start="1124.559" dur="3.49">there are three types a face that are
talked about in Scripture first type</text>
  <text start="1128.049" dur="0.25">with</text>
  <text start="1128.299" dur="3.61">faith which we see from the Epistles is
what we would call propositional faith</text>
  <text start="1131.909" dur="1.661">forgot just kinda give statements</text>
  <text start="1133.57" dur="3.179">truth your special line your thinking
and your thoughts with that</text>
  <text start="1136.749" dur="3.29">K and there&amp;#39;s another another type of
faith</text>
  <text start="1140.039" dur="3.311">has to do with your character for the
Spirit is faithful</text>
  <text start="1143.989" dur="4.19">knots special hyper faces something
worse was understand with her mind</text>
  <text start="1148.179" dur="2.11">because our mind was created in the
image of God</text>
  <text start="1150.289" dur="3.51">we think rationally we think logically
response to think his thoughts after him</text>
  <text start="1155.039" dur="4.74">the next type is my soul my soul gets
dynamically change by the power of the</text>
  <text start="1159.779" dur="2.301">Holy Spirit the third type a face is
what we call the</text>
  <text start="1162.08" dur="3.549">gift to pay case a Jesus is not sane</text>
  <text start="1165.629" dur="2.77">you don&amp;#39;t understand that there&amp;#39;s a God
he&amp;#39;s not saying you do not believe</text>
  <text start="1168.399" dur="2.181">there&amp;#39;s a god he&amp;#39;s not dealing with that</text>
  <text start="1170.58" dur="3.219">realm of pay how many do you think
that&amp;#39;s the problem when you pray for</text>
  <text start="1173.799" dur="2.051">people have to work something up</text>
  <text start="1175.85" dur="3.209">to get something to happen you&amp;#39;re
thinking in the wrong arena</text>
  <text start="1180.169" dur="3.25">he&amp;#39;s not talking to him about character
dynamic either</text>
  <text start="1183.419" dur="3.301">is not saying you can cast out the demon
cuz you&amp;#39;re not writes this is not</text>
  <text start="1186.72" dur="0.48">because</text>
  <text start="1187.2" dur="4.449">if you guys realized if that&amp;#39;s the
estimation doing americorps anything our</text>
  <text start="1191.649" dur="0.37">life</text>
  <text start="1192.019" dur="4.181">even though never do it our character
will never be good enough so God gives</text>
  <text start="1196.2" dur="2.959">us his righteousness</text>
  <text start="1199.159" dur="3.311">right she&amp;#39;s not talking about that so

ministry of the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="1300.34" dur="3.12">and so he says if you have faith as
