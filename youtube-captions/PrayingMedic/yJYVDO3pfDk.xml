  <text start="6.66" dur="7.74">daily news update thanks for joining me</text>
  <text start="9.83" dur="8.65">I&amp;#39;m going to start off with a little</text>
  <text start="14.4" dur="7.2">story that was tweeted out by Sundance</text>
  <text start="18.48" dur="8.73">of the last refuge this has to do with</text>
  <text start="21.6" dur="7.8">the fisa 702 debate that is going on in</text>
  <text start="27.21" dur="5.369">the Senate right now it looks like the</text>
  <text start="29.4" dur="6.69">FISA 702 is going to be renewed this is</text>
  <text start="32.579" dur="6.471">this allows the FBI access to the NSA</text>
  <text start="36.09" dur="5.84">database to look at information</text>
  <text start="39.05" dur="5.02">ostensibly to stop terrorists</text>
  <text start="41.93" dur="4.12">unfortunately it has been abused by</text>
  <text start="44.07" dur="5.16">people in the intelligence community and</text>
  <text start="46.05" dur="5.91">they have illegally surveilled people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="49.23" dur="6.18">private citizens and gathered their</text>
  <text start="51.96" dur="6.68">information so there&amp;#39;s some debate over</text>
  <text start="55.41" dur="5.489">that interesting thing is it Bruce or</text>
  <text start="58.64" dur="5.549">who is the deputy assistant attorney</text>
  <text start="60.899" dur="6.031">general who&amp;#39;s mixed up in this whole</text>
  <text start="64.189" dur="5.561">steel dossier thing he was supposed to</text>
  <text start="66.93" dur="6.78">testify and they have pushed back his</text>
  <text start="69.75" dur="7.56">testimony to mid-february not surprising</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="5.37">because if or we&amp;#39;re going to testify he</text>
  <text start="77.31" dur="3.57">was going to talk about the FISA 702</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="4.35">abuse nobody asked him about about that</text>
  <text start="80.88" dur="3.9">and then somebody would have to report</text>
  <text start="83.43" dur="3.57">on that and there would be reports</text>
  <text start="84.78" dur="4.379">coming out in the news about the abuse</text>
  <text start="87" dur="4.619">of FISA 702 at the same time they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="89.159" dur="4.231">trying to get this thing renewed so</text>
  <text start="91.619" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;re pushing it back because they</text>
  <text start="93.39" dur="4.86">want to get FISA 702 reauthorized and</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="4.109">then they&amp;#39;re going to tell us how badly</text>
  <text start="98.25" dur="6.18">was abused</text>
  <text start="100.079" dur="7.171">Devon Nunez who is chair of the House</text>
  <text start="104.43" dur="5.189">Intelligence Committee said later this</text>
  <text start="107.25" dur="4.799">month after the FISA 702 debate has</text>
  <text start="109.619" dur="5.43">calmed down he is going to tell the full</text>
  <text start="112.049" dur="5.581">House of Representatives about the abuse</text>
  <text start="115.049" dur="5.721">that he has seen there are people that</text>
  <text start="117.63" dur="6.529">are requesting all of the documents be</text>
  <text start="120.77" dur="5.98">declassified and unredacted so that</text>
  <text start="124.159" dur="5.231">people can understand how this</text>
  <text start="126.75" dur="3.81">intelligence system was abused so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="129.39" dur="3.48">going to be kind of a big deal you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="130.56" dur="2.63">see more information on that and then</text>
  <text start="132.87" dur="6.2">coming</text>
  <text start="133.19" dur="9.33">weeks just just a heads up let&amp;#39;s see the</text>
  <text start="139.07" dur="7.71">president and his physical today and the</text>
  <text start="142.52" dur="6.87">president requested a cognitive exam one</text>
  <text start="146.78" dur="5.16">of the most difficult cognitive exams it</text>
  <text start="149.39" dur="6.63">is used to determine things like</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="6.71">Parkinson&amp;#39;s and Alzheimer&amp;#39;s and it tests</text>
  <text start="156.02" dur="4.8">your ability to to think and process and</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="4.72">he scored a perfect score on his</text>
  <text start="160.82" dur="4.56">cognitive exam today physical exam like</text>
  <text start="163.37" dur="3.24">great doc said you&amp;#39;re about 15 pounds</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="4.08">overweight</text>
  <text start="166.61" dur="5.82">other than that you look great so looks</text>
  <text start="169.46" dur="6.99">like the president is in good shape he</text>
  <text start="172.43" dur="5.55">is in good health and we all knew if you</text>
  <text start="176.45" dur="5.73">follow the president you follow my</text>
  <text start="177.98" dur="6.72">broadcast he is a stable genius and now</text>
  <text start="182.18" dur="7.01">we have a doctor&amp;#39;s assessment that he is</text>
  <text start="184.7" dur="7.35">a stable genius so we have that too</text>
  <text start="189.19" dur="5.2">and I&amp;#39;m sure the media is not happy</text>
  <text start="192.05" dur="8.67">about that either they were really</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="8.31">trying to work that narrative that from</text>
  <text start="200.72" dur="5.28">the book that Trump you know is</text>
  <text start="202.7" dur="4.71">forgetful and he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s not doing all</text>
  <text start="206" dur="3.45">that not all that mentally sharpened</text>
  <text start="207.41" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s just a false narrative we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="209.45" dur="5.789">talk about false narratives tonight by</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="5.22">the way interesting story from the</text>
  <text start="215.239" dur="3.871">Washington Post</text>
  <text start="216.41" dur="5.52">nearly all of the members of the</text>
  <text start="219.11" dur="8.159">National Park Service advisory panel</text>
  <text start="221.93" dur="8.88">resigned in frustration this evidently</text>
  <text start="227.269" dur="5.701">over the last week or so this is an</text>
  <text start="230.81" dur="4.58">advisory panel it&amp;#39;s not actual National</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="5.519">Park workers it&amp;#39;s an advisory panel and</text>
  <text start="235.39" dur="4.78">their frustration is it Ryan Zinke wants</text>
  <text start="238.489" dur="6.441">to give back a lot of federal land to</text>
  <text start="240.17" dur="7.86">the states and to private landowners and</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="5.17">these are bureaucrats who feel like the</text>
  <text start="248.03" dur="5.01">federal government should be taking more</text>
  <text start="250.1" dur="4.47">land and zenki is like no we&amp;#39;re given</text>
  <text start="253.04" dur="3.71">I&amp;#39;m gonna give land back to the states</text>
  <text start="254.57" dur="5.88">I&amp;#39;m gonna get federal land back to the</text>
  <text start="256.75" dur="6.36">people who should have it and so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="260.45" dur="6.41">a little clash of ideologies going on</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="5.339">in the Department of Interior so that</text>
  <text start="266.86" dur="8.19">you might be interested in hearing about</text>
  <text start="268.449" dur="9.601">that there was a article from Financial</text>
  <text start="275.05" dur="6.179">Times and this is related to a story I</text>
  <text start="278.05" dur="7.23">reported a couple days ago that Germany</text>
  <text start="281.229" dur="6.84">has decided to get out of the their deal</text>
  <text start="285.28" dur="4.05">on carbon emissions and reducing</text>
  <text start="288.069" dur="6.481">greenhouse gases because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="7.139">going to meet their their goals for 2020</text>
  <text start="294.55" dur="4.739">and now there&amp;#39;s an announcement that the</text>
  <text start="296.469" dur="4.651">UK is also announced that they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="299.289" dur="5.16">going to meet their goals for carbon</text>
  <text start="301.12" dur="5.34">emissions for 2020 or probably for 2030</text>
  <text start="304.449" dur="5.851">so they&amp;#39;re looking at backing out of</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="6.389">their deal there their commitments to</text>
  <text start="310.3" dur="5.82">reducing greenhouse gases because they</text>
  <text start="312.849" dur="5.011">were really I think unrealistic goals in</text>
  <text start="316.12" dur="4.799">the first place and it&amp;#39;s just ironic</text>
  <text start="317.86" dur="5.429">that the president got us out of these</text>
  <text start="320.919" dur="4.411">deals of the Paris climate Accord and</text>
  <text start="323.289" dur="3.93">the nations who were criticizing and</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="3.929">screaming at us because we decided to</text>
  <text start="327.219" dur="3.781">get out of them they those nations</text>
  <text start="329.259" dur="5.46">themselves are not going to meet their</text>
  <text start="331" dur="7.169">their you know their goals so what I</text>
  <text start="334.719" dur="6.57">don&amp;#39;t understand why people are so I</text>
  <text start="338.169" dur="5.55">think why they can&amp;#39;t see that this is</text>
  <text start="341.289" dur="5.071">just a it&amp;#39;s a false narrative and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.719" dur="5.721">about taking our money and giving</text>
  <text start="346.36" dur="10.979">putting us in an economic disadvantage</text>
  <text start="349.44" dur="10.599">hypocrites correct this is something I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="357.339" dur="5.101">going to throw out there and you won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="360.039" dur="2.91">necessarily be able to make sense of it</text>
  <text start="362.44" dur="5.21">right now</text>
  <text start="362.949" dur="10.801">but Michael Cohen who is Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="9.989">personal attorney has been wrapped up in</text>
  <text start="373.75" dur="6.9">this Russia collusion investigation and</text>
  <text start="377.639" dur="5.68">the reason why Michael Cohen and his</text>
  <text start="380.65" dur="5.629">name appeared in in the dossier that was</text>
  <text start="383.319" dur="8.371">used it was created by diffusion GPS</text>
  <text start="386.279" dur="9.07">well they put him in the dossier because</text>
  <text start="391.69" dur="4.62">they had some intelligence that he had</text>
  <text start="395.349" dur="4.761">gone to</text>
  <text start="396.31" dur="6.81">and I think the Czech Republic and</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="6.16">unfortunately for them the intelligence</text>
  <text start="403.12" dur="4.35">they got was bad it wasn&amp;#39;t the Michael</text>
  <text start="406.27" dur="3.66">Cohen whose Trump&amp;#39;s attorney it was a</text>
  <text start="407.47" dur="6.18">different Michael Cohen and now Michael</text>
  <text start="409.93" dur="7.74">Cohen is suing fusion GPS for libel and</text>
  <text start="413.65" dur="5.61">slander and they probably deserve that</text>
  <text start="417.67" dur="3.27">because number one they got the</text>
  <text start="419.26" dur="3.3">intelligence illegally in number two</text>
  <text start="420.94" dur="3.96">they weren&amp;#39;t very careful about putting</text>
  <text start="422.56" dur="4.26">it together so you&amp;#39;re going to see this</text>
  <text start="424.9" dur="3.69">become a little bit bigger story down</text>
  <text start="426.82" dur="3.57">the road I&amp;#39;m just giving you this to</text>
  <text start="428.59" dur="3.66">kind of make you aware that that is a</text>
  <text start="430.39" dur="4.8">thing that it&amp;#39;s going to become a bigger</text>
  <text start="432.25" dur="5.85">thing because when his case goes to</text>
  <text start="435.19" dur="6.18">court they&amp;#39;re going to ask him where did</text>
  <text start="438.1" dur="5.64">the intelligence come from that made you</text>
  <text start="441.37" dur="5.31">think this guy went to Russia and then</text>
  <text start="443.74" dur="5.43">fusion GPS will have to admit well we</text>
  <text start="446.68" dur="5.88">kind of had illegal access to the FISA</text>
  <text start="449.17" dur="5.52">702 database that the FBI let us get in</text>
  <text start="452.56" dur="3.42">there and we got information and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="454.69" dur="5.34">information we weren&amp;#39;t supposed to have</text>
  <text start="455.98" dur="5.88">it and we kind of came up with the wrong</text>
  <text start="460.03" dur="3.27">information it&amp;#39;s going to be very</text>
  <text start="461.86" dur="3.12">embarrassing when they have to explain</text>
  <text start="463.3" dur="4.85">where they got this information from</text>
  <text start="464.98" dur="6.99">because it&amp;#39;s looking like they did</text>
  <text start="468.15" dur="7.6">illegally access the FISA database with</text>
  <text start="471.97" dur="6.03">the permission of the FBI and if you see</text>
  <text start="475.75" dur="3.57">me tweeting about that now you know what</text>
  <text start="478" dur="3.03">I&amp;#39;m tweeting about and if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="479.32" dur="4.86">following my broadcasts you kind of you</text>
  <text start="481.03" dur="5.52">should be up on that house intelligence</text>
  <text start="484.18" dur="4.2">committee interviewed Steve Bannon today</text>
  <text start="486.55" dur="3.24">been and refused to answer some</text>
  <text start="488.38" dur="3.75">questions so they&amp;#39;re gonna issue a</text>
  <text start="489.79" dur="3.81">subpoena or I think he may be under a</text>
  <text start="492.13" dur="9.09">subpoena already and he has refused to</text>
  <text start="493.6" dur="8.1">answer with Gregory really I did I did</text>
  <text start="501.22" dur="4.88">know that</text>
  <text start="501.7" dur="7.47">Denis is saying that that Bannon</text>
  <text start="506.1" dur="10.05">testified before a grand jury okay I</text>
  <text start="509.17" dur="12.56">didn&amp;#39;t know that okay</text>
  <text start="516.15" dur="8.53">going to daca and the budget issue so</text>
  <text start="521.73" dur="6.1">the president has been tweeting over the</text>
  <text start="524.68" dur="5.61">last four days that he believes</text>
  <text start="527.83" dur="4.83">Democrats are not sincere about</text>
  <text start="530.29" dur="4.71">negotiating a DAC I dream and that daca</text>
  <text start="532.66" dur="5.94">is essentially dead</text>
  <text start="535" dur="4.74">I noticed that Speaker Mitch McConnell</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="3.51">tweeted out tonight</text>
  <text start="539.74" dur="4.709">he believes that daca is pretty much</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="5.07">dead for that for this negotiation</text>
  <text start="544.449" dur="4.671">they&amp;#39;re negotiating it it looks like</text>
  <text start="547.18" dur="3.959">they&amp;#39;re gonna do another 30-day</text>
  <text start="549.12" dur="3.73">continuing resolution we&amp;#39;re gonna fund</text>
  <text start="551.139" dur="3.171">the government for another 30 days and</text>
  <text start="552.85" dur="5.429">we&amp;#39;re gonna be back here in February</text>
  <text start="554.31" dur="5.92">going at another try to get a one-year</text>
  <text start="558.279" dur="3.48">budget they just keep on doing a 30-day</text>
  <text start="560.23" dur="6.21">continuing resolution which is kind of</text>
  <text start="561.759" dur="6.541">frustrating but McConnell has said that</text>
  <text start="566.44" dur="3.98">it doesn&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re not going to put daca</text>
  <text start="568.3" dur="5.039">on this there isn&amp;#39;t an organized effort</text>
  <text start="570.42" dur="4.3">to negotiate daca so they&amp;#39;re going to do</text>
  <text start="573.339" dur="4.05">it looks like going to do a continuing</text>
  <text start="574.72" dur="5">resolution with no daca just to let you</text>
  <text start="577.389" dur="5.401">know where that&amp;#39;s at and Chuck Schumer</text>
  <text start="579.72" dur="6.64">has been screaming at the president that</text>
  <text start="582.79" dur="6.51">he needs to get on board and get a daca</text>
  <text start="586.36" dur="4.61">deal done before it&amp;#39;s too late and I</text>
