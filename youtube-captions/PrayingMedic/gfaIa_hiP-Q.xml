  <text start="14.509" dur="3">talking about them well they were</text>
  <text start="15.799" dur="3.54">pursuing their destiny they were</text>
  <text start="17.509" dur="4.08">pursuing the power to make a difference</text>
  <text start="19.339" dur="6.121">through a role for statesmen that was</text>
  <text start="21.589" dur="6.901">the plan of God and so to me the first</text>
  <text start="25.46" dur="5.61">step is be congruent honest about your</text>
  <text start="28.49" dur="4.56">passion and where I where I go is I take</text>
  <text start="31.07" dur="3.57">people into a state the key is state get</text>
  <text start="33.05" dur="3.509">into a PTA get into a state where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="34.64" dur="3.45">feeling fairly empowered and optimistic</text>
  <text start="36.559" dur="3.721">and juiced I don&amp;#39;t know put on your best</text>
  <text start="38.09" dur="4.019">music get a Starbucks don&amp;#39;t let anyone</text>
  <text start="40.28" dur="3.329">bug you get in a moment when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="42.109" dur="3.27">asked when you&amp;#39;re accessing what it</text>
  <text start="43.609" dur="3.961">feels like to be at the top of your game</text>
  <text start="45.379" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s important because you&amp;#39;re opening</text>
  <text start="47.57" dur="4.41">up all the synapses to to what you</text>
  <text start="49.489" dur="3.84">really are all designed to be at that</text>
  <text start="51.98" dur="4.23">moment I tell people just to a free</text>
  <text start="53.329" dur="5.041">consciousness flow just say god help me</text>
  <text start="56.21" dur="5.579">to get in touch with what I&amp;#39;m really all</text>
  <text start="58.37" dur="7.14">about because the the DNA of the oak</text>
  <text start="61.789" dur="5.251">tree is already in the Acorn so your</text>
  <text start="65.51" dur="3.42">full destiny and its glorious</text>
  <text start="67.04" dur="4.98">fulfillment is already in the microcosm</text>
  <text start="68.93" dur="4.5">of your heart when soul but first king</text>
  <text start="72.02" dur="4.44">of Israel came to Samuel the great</text>
  <text start="73.43" dur="4.77">prophet Samuel the Prophet said I need</text>
  <text start="76.46" dur="2.82">to talk to you because I&amp;#39;m going to tell</text>
  <text start="78.2" dur="3.51">you about everything that&amp;#39;s in your</text>
  <text start="79.28" dur="4.34">heart the reason why Saul was looking</text>
  <text start="81.71" dur="4.35">for the prophet is because he lost his</text>
  <text start="83.62" dur="5.47">all of the donkeys for the farm which</text>
  <text start="86.06" dur="4.65">meant his means of economic survival was</text>
  <text start="89.09" dur="3.27">in jeopardy so he was going from what he</text>
  <text start="90.71" dur="3.57">considered to be you know the prophet or</text>
  <text start="92.36" dur="3.57">the today be like a psychic where</text>
  <text start="94.28" dur="4.14">where&amp;#39;s my loss you know tractors and</text>
  <text start="95.93" dur="4.08">the Prophet basically said yeah it said</text>
  <text start="98.42" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re looking for your tractors don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="100.01" dur="3.42">worry about that they&amp;#39;re already found</text>
  <text start="101.66" dur="4.35">the reason you really came to me is</text>
  <text start="103.43" dur="4.38">because there&amp;#39;s a destiny and so God</text>
  <text start="106.01" dur="2.91">manipulated your problem to bring you to</text>
  <text start="107.81" dur="2.76">this moment I wonder how many people</text>
  <text start="108.92" dur="3.84">have problems that are manipulated by</text>
  <text start="110.57" dur="4.5">heaven to bring up to this moment what</text>
  <text start="112.76" dur="5.31">am I really supposed to do in my life so</text>
  <text start="115.07" dur="5.31">all he says to him in your heart is a</text>
  <text start="118.07" dur="5.04">king we&amp;#39;re gonna talk tomorrow about</text>
  <text start="120.38" dur="4.71">your call as a King Saul I had no idea</text>
  <text start="123.11" dur="3.93">was a king but the Prophet could see it</text>
  <text start="125.09" dur="3.629">so getting in touch with your heart is</text>
  <text start="127.04" dur="3.96">the first thing you&amp;#39;ve got something in</text>
  <text start="128.719" dur="4.291">you that&amp;#39;s bigger than your living and</text>
  <text start="131" dur="2.96">and that gap between what&amp;#39;s in you and</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="2.48">what you&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="133.96" dur="5.04">is where the tension comes the midlife</text>
  <text start="135.49" dur="5.82">crisis so the first step is write down</text>
  <text start="139" dur="3.72">the top 15-20 things you want to be in</text>
  <text start="141.31" dur="3.21">your life that you&amp;#39;ve never been write</text>
  <text start="142.72" dur="3.33">down the top 20 30 things you want to do</text>
  <text start="144.52" dur="3.06">that you&amp;#39;ve never done write down the</text>
  <text start="146.05" dur="2.58">top 20 things you want to experience</text>
  <text start="147.58" dur="2.22">you&amp;#39;ve never experienced learn that</text>
  <text start="148.63" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;ve never learned see that you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="149.8" dur="4.08">never seen and when you get done with</text>
  <text start="152.53" dur="2.55">that list of what you want to see what</text>
  <text start="153.88" dur="4.29">you want experience what you want to be</text>
  <text start="155.08" dur="5.01">what you want to do or know take that</text>
  <text start="158.17" dur="5.07">list and then then then ferociously</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="5.7">would look down to your top 10 always</text>
  <text start="163.24" dur="4.41">asking yourself over and over again what</text>
  <text start="165.79" dur="3.81">gives me the most juice because what</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="3.39">people unconsciously do the more the</text>
  <text start="169.6" dur="3">more spiritual and religious they are</text>
  <text start="171.04" dur="3.18">the more they mess this up</text>
  <text start="172.6" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s amazing if I can get someone who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="174.22" dur="3.33">totally a secular individual I can work</text>
  <text start="176.14" dur="3">fast if I&amp;#39;m working with a really nice</text>
  <text start="177.55" dur="3.81">missionary person it takes me longer</text>
  <text start="179.14" dur="3.9">because what but what people were the</text>
  <text start="181.36" dur="3.48">clear what sensitive conscious to is</text>
  <text start="183.04" dur="4.53">they embed what they think they ought to</text>
  <text start="184.84" dur="4.38">want into what they want so they say I</text>
  <text start="187.57" dur="3">want to help the poor I want to you know</text>
  <text start="189.22" dur="3.63">funny to do anything they&amp;#39;re putting oh</text>
  <text start="190.57" dur="4.59">come on worship it&amp;#39;s like well no no</text>
  <text start="192.85" dur="4.38">take all that out unpack it for a second</text>
  <text start="195.16" dur="4.71">I want to just I want you to tell me</text>
  <text start="197.23" dur="4.65">what is your passion in terms of what</text>
  <text start="199.87" dur="3.54">you want to do experience be and if that</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="3.96">really is it well put it in the top 10</text>
  <text start="203.41" dur="4.26">but many times I got to shake the tree</text>
  <text start="205.84" dur="3.03">so that they could say I want to make a</text>
  <text start="207.67" dur="2.46">lot of money and travel and make an</text>
  <text start="208.87" dur="3.18">impact and hang out with professionals</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;ve had this happen where once people</text>
  <text start="212.05" dur="5.37">get clear on it it&amp;#39;s like whoa you feel</text>
  <text start="213.97" dur="4.92">the juice so we get the top ten once you</text>
  <text start="217.42" dur="3.48">get the top ten I work them down to the</text>
  <text start="218.89" dur="3.72">top three the reason we do does like a</text>
  <text start="220.9" dur="3.48">horse race it&amp;#39;s in a comparing one to</text>
  <text start="222.61" dur="5.1">the other is once I get the top three or</text>
  <text start="224.38" dur="5.76">four or five or six I really know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="227.71" dur="5.37">in their heart now God is going to do a</text>
  <text start="230.14" dur="6">job of refining it but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="233.08" dur="5.37">essentially work true north is that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.14" dur="4.83">their passion if I could get you to</text>
  <text start="238.45" dur="5.61">articulate your passion and say it</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="5.13">without guilt or without unbelief I can</text>
  <text start="244.06" dur="4.77">create the attraction factor for favor</text>
  <text start="246.1" dur="5.16">because once you start to say who you</text>
  <text start="248.83" dur="4.8">are and what you&amp;#39;re all about you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="251.26" dur="4.44">resonating harmonically with the design</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="4.2">of this of heaven for you and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="255.7" dur="3.93">certain seat every voice has a signature</text>
  <text start="257.83" dur="4.02">sound every voice is like a thumbprint</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="3.71">different and when your voice goes out</text>
  <text start="261.85" dur="3.98">resonating with your does</text>
  <text start="263.34" dur="4.799">and purpose and destiny even though you</text>
  <text start="265.83" dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t fully comprehend it and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="268.139" dur="4.5">as pure this final form once you speak</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="3.75">what you&amp;#39;re all about you attract to you</text>
  <text start="272.639" dur="4.021">the resources you need to manifest it</text>
  <text start="274.38" dur="3.39">you&amp;#39;re on the way to becoming connected</text>
  <text start="276.66" dur="4.2">to who you really are and what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="277.77" dur="5.91">called to do that&amp;#39;s the step the real</text>
  <text start="280.86" dur="5.279">spiritual part answer is I would I would</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="5.97">always add this caveat I would add add</text>
  <text start="286.139" dur="6.391">this God show me it&amp;#39;s just a prayer</text>
  <text start="289.65" dur="5.97">show me what talents gifts an ability to</text>
  <text start="292.53" dur="4.859">given me so that I can I can leverage my</text>
  <text start="295.62" dur="4.5">life to the greatest stewardship of</text>
  <text start="297.389" dur="5.131">influence for the sake of others start</text>
  <text start="300.12" dur="5.13">off with that kind of focused so that</text>
  <text start="302.52" dur="4.02">you get you open up to the idea that you</text>
  <text start="305.25" dur="3.96">might have talents and gifts and other</text>
  <text start="306.54" dur="4.62">people impacted and add that nuance to</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="3.99">it but you could end up at the same</text>
  <text start="311.16" dur="3.569">intersection either way whether you pray</text>
  <text start="313.2" dur="3">with more focus of what he just kind of</text>
  <text start="314.729" dur="3.601">throw it up in the air if I can get</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="3.57">people clear on passion I could get them</text>
  <text start="318.33" dur="3.059">in the step towards where favor will</text>
  <text start="319.77" dur="4.59">start to work once favor starts to work</text>
  <text start="321.389" dur="4.681">the law of attraction takes over you</text>
  <text start="324.36" dur="4.25">know the average person is thinking 1500</text>
  <text start="326.07" dur="4.409">words a minute this is amazing to me</text>
  <text start="328.61" dur="4.48">1,500 words meant that&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="330.479" dur="4.291">traffic so when those words are going on</text>
  <text start="333.09" dur="4.77">1,500 words a minute there&amp;#39;s tremendous</text>
  <text start="334.77" dur="4.44">capacity for distraction when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="337.86" dur="2.489">working with clients and I&amp;#39;m teaching</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="4.95">them how to operate with the spirit</text>
  <text start="340.349" dur="6.271">realm I say you need to start looking at</text>
  <text start="344.16" dur="4.95">this the way Jesus taught as a rabbi</text>
  <text start="346.62" dur="5.79">taught his disciples he said when you go</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="6.69">into the territory that you want to</text>
  <text start="352.41" dur="5.67">influence release your peace upon it so</text>
  <text start="355.8" dur="5.1">one of the great mysteries is your state</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="4.41">if it&amp;#39;s one of peace if you are peace</text>
  <text start="360.9" dur="4.019">with God and peace with yourself and</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="4.98">others you carry that capacity to</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="4.051">influence the sphere around you so that</text>
  <text start="367.47" dur="3.18">when you go into that environment you</text>
  <text start="368.97" dur="4.319">can release peace upon the environment</text>
  <text start="370.65" dur="6.84">now 1500 words a minute of internal</text>
  <text start="373.289" dur="6.391">dialogue dials down and people will say</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="3.78">things when you&amp;#39;re in an environment</text>
  <text start="379.68" dur="3.6">where you&amp;#39;re spiritually kind of in</text>
  <text start="381.27" dur="5.88">control because you released peace and</text>
  <text start="383.28" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;ll say things like you know we</text>
  <text start="387.15" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t normally do this but and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="389.19" dur="4.8">the best that&amp;#39;s the preamble to a change</text>
  <text start="392.01" dur="3.24">in policy something they never done</text>
  <text start="393.99" dur="2.489">before and I don&amp;#39;t want to hear that I</text>
  <text start="395.25" dur="3.77">always know that&amp;#39;s favor</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="4.5">working with the authority of peace and</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="4.149">the two of those things flow together</text>
  <text start="400.979" dur="4.02">when you&amp;#39;re in your passion because your</text>
  <text start="403.169" dur="4.14">passion will move you into the spheres</text>
  <text start="404.999" dur="5.461">of influence that accomplish your desire</text>
  <text start="407.309" dur="5.461">and then you release your peace 1,500</text>
  <text start="410.46" dur="5.16">words a minute and one nation I went</text>
  <text start="412.77" dur="5.22">into the interior ministry had a had a</text>
  <text start="415.62" dur="5.819">almost like that a disorder like Monk</text>

  <text start="421.439" dur="4.32">obsessive-compulsive and he&amp;#39;s a high</text>

  <text start="425.759" dur="2.37">in to meet with us we&amp;#39;re thermoforming</text>

  <text start="434.219" dur="3.45">neurotic ritual</text>
  <text start="435.3" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re horrified because you know we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="437.669" dur="3.33">down talking about reform because we</text>

  <text start="444.87" dur="5.19">disastrous we forgot to do the spiritual</text>
