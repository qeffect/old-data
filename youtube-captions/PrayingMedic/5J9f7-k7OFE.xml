  <text start="45" dur="4.95">about power taught you about Authority</text>
  <text start="47.76" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;ve taught you about emotional healing</text>
  <text start="49.95" dur="4.41">a little bit we&amp;#39;ve talked about God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="52.11" dur="4.35">presence talked about all these concepts</text>
  <text start="54.36" dur="5.01">and we have a lot more to cover</text>
  <text start="56.46" dur="6.239">there are 28 chapters in the book so</text>
  <text start="59.37" dur="5.34">we&amp;#39;re only halfway through a lot more</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="5.161">information to cover but now it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="64.71" dur="5.63">to give you some practical this is where</text>
  <text start="67.86" dur="6.21">the rubber meets the road Jesus</text>
  <text start="70.34" dur="7.419">commissioned his disciples Matthew</text>
  <text start="74.07" dur="5.089">chapter 10 chose the twelve disciples as</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="4.231">soon as he chose to be commissioned them</text>
  <text start="79.159" dur="6.401">sent them out and he said heal the sick</text>
  <text start="81.99" dur="6.18">cleanse the lepers cast out demons raise</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="4.32">the dead preach the kingdom this is the</text>
  <text start="88.17" dur="4.5">five things that Jesus commissioned his</text>
  <text start="89.88" dur="5.449">disciples to do he sent out the twelve</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="6.18">and they did that they came back and</text>
  <text start="95.329" dur="5.441">they reported on what they saw Lord even</text>
  <text start="98.85" dur="5.46">the demons are subject to us in your</text>
  <text start="100.77" dur="5.61">name he said do not marvel that the</text>
  <text start="104.31" dur="5.43">demons obey you marvel that your names</text>
  <text start="106.38" dur="6.21">are written in the book of life and then</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="6.03">he sent out the seventy and he gave them</text>
  <text start="112.59" dur="4.889">the same Commission heal the sick cast</text>
  <text start="115.77" dur="5.61">out demons cleanse the lepers raise the</text>
  <text start="117.479" dur="6.361">dead proclaim the kingdom this was the</text>
  <text start="121.38" dur="6.18">only model for ministry that Jesus ever</text>
  <text start="123.84" dur="7.59">gave his disciples he gave them this</text>
  <text start="127.56" dur="6.27">commission and he taught them and that</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="4.95">was what the kingdom of God</text>
  <text start="133.83" dur="3.99">was all about healing miracles casting</text>
  <text start="136.38" dur="3.96">out demons setting people free of</text>
  <text start="137.82" dur="5.91">oppression that was the model for the</text>
  <text start="140.34" dur="4.83">church that Jesus established now for</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="2.85">those of you who go to church on a</text>
  <text start="145.17" dur="3.84">regular basis when you go to church</text>
  <text start="146.58" dur="3.81">tomorrow are you going to be in a</text>
  <text start="149.01" dur="3.42">service where they&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="150.39" dur="4.71">teaching and demonstrating healing</text>
  <text start="152.43" dur="7.23">miracles casting out demons and raising</text>
  <text start="155.1" dur="7.98">the dead if not you should ask yourself</text>
  <text start="159.66" dur="8.49">why how did the church get so far off of</text>
  <text start="163.08" dur="8.94">the Commission that Jesus gave them over</text>
  <text start="168.15" dur="7.02">the last 2,000 years why is the church</text>
  <text start="172.02" dur="4.62">not out there at Walmart at restaurants</text>
  <text start="175.17" dur="4.32">and grocery stores getting people healed</text>
  <text start="176.64" dur="5.16">because that&amp;#39;s what the disciples did in</text>
  <text start="179.49" dur="5.37">the first century how did we get so far</text>
  <text start="181.8" dur="6.03">off of that how did our gospel our good</text>
  <text start="184.86" dur="6.09">news get so far removed from what Jesus</text>
  <text start="187.83" dur="4.56">taught his disciples to do there are a</text>
  <text start="190.95" dur="3.81">number of different ways in which you</text>
  <text start="192.39" dur="5.28">can find people to pray for who need</text>
  <text start="194.76" dur="5.19">healing one of the ways is revelation</text>
  <text start="197.67" dur="4.319">sometimes God will give me dreams about</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="4.14">people that he wants me to pray for for</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="4.801">healing and then I will run into those</text>
  <text start="204.09" dur="5.25">people in the next day or two sometimes</text>
  <text start="206.79" dur="4.979">God will show you specific people but</text>
  <text start="209.34" dur="8.07">the other thing is you can go around to</text>
  <text start="211.769" dur="9.031">your town and you can find places where</text>
  <text start="217.41" dur="5.76">sick people hang out at hospitals</text>
  <text start="220.8" dur="4.98">nursing homes right we know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="223.17" dur="4.94">gonna be sick people there jesus knew</text>
  <text start="225.78" dur="6.63">that he could go to the Pool of Bethesda</text>
  <text start="228.11" dur="6.25">and find people who needed to be healed</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="3.81">because an angel would come stir the</text>
  <text start="234.36" dur="3.93">water the sick and infirmed were there</text>
  <text start="236.22" dur="3.75">first one to get in would be healed so</text>
  <text start="238.29" dur="3.78">jesus knew there were places he could go</text>
  <text start="239.97" dur="3.299">where he could find the sick and the</text>
  <text start="242.07" dur="3.33">blind and the lame and the lepers he</text>
  <text start="243.269" dur="4.801">could go to leper colonies right Mary</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="4.11">Grace words of knowledge God will give</text>
  <text start="248.07" dur="4.71">you words of knowledge about people he</text>
  <text start="249.51" dur="5.039">wants healed in the first video I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="252.78" dur="3.75">going to show you the Lord gives me</text>
  <text start="254.549" dur="7.261">several words of knowledge and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="256.53" dur="7.889">see how that works but you can go just</text>
  <text start="261.81" dur="5.46">about anywhere and find people who need</text>
  <text start="264.419" dur="4.921">healing today there is</text>
  <text start="267.27" dur="3.78">a place that is somewhat analogous to</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="4.59">the Pool of Bethesda and it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="271.05" dur="5.94">is Walmart when I started out healing</text>
  <text start="273.93" dur="5.28">about eight years ago me and my friends</text>
  <text start="276.99" dur="4.169">would go to Walmart because we noticed</text>
  <text start="279.21" dur="5.179">there is an ignorant number of people</text>
  <text start="281.159" dur="6.72">who were in wheelchairs they had cast</text>
  <text start="284.389" dur="5.74">crutches canes neck braces immobilizers</text>
  <text start="287.879" dur="3.811">we would go through Walmart and we would</text>
  <text start="290.129" dur="4.891">find all kinds of people who needed to</text>
  <text start="291.69" dur="5.25">be healed and many of us kind of built</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="4.23">our ministry around Walmart miracles</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="6.39">we&amp;#39;d go to Walmart pray for people and</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="6.539">see him get healed I have a number of</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="5.579">friends who have done that and you can</text>
  <text start="305.789" dur="4.861">do that at any place the grocery stores</text>
  <text start="308.909" dur="4.171">or hardware stores I&amp;#39;ve done that over</text>
  <text start="310.65" dur="5.22">the years a lot of the people that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="4.739">seen healed I have seen healed an</text>
  <text start="315.87" dur="3.75">ambulance nursing homes in hospitals</text>
  <text start="317.819" dur="3.811">because that&amp;#39;s where I worked but you</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="3.72">know if you work at someplace else</text>
  <text start="321.63" dur="3.539">there&amp;#39;s no reason you can&amp;#39;t pray for</text>
  <text start="323.34" dur="5.009">people to be healed there I have a good</text>
  <text start="325.169" dur="5.761">friend who works at Home Depot he sends</text>
  <text start="328.349" dur="5.04">me text messages every day about people</text>
  <text start="330.93" dur="4.229">that he prays for at Home Depot he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="333.389" dur="4.08">just asking people hey do you have a</text>
  <text start="335.159" dur="4.5">sore hand hey do you have sore back do</text>
  <text start="337.469" dur="3.781">you have knee pain and you know the Lord</text>
  <text start="339.659" dur="3.241">will give him words of knowledge he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="4.38">walk up to them asked him if they wanted</text>
  <text start="342.9" dur="4.829">prayer sometimes they say yes sometimes</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="4.439">they say no he&amp;#39;ll walk up he&amp;#39;ll release</text>
  <text start="347.729" dur="5.28">power or command a demon to leave and</text>
  <text start="350.069" dur="7.19">they&amp;#39;ll be healed and he sees this all</text>
  <text start="353.009" dur="7.111">the time yes Todd white is it was an</text>
  <text start="357.259" dur="4.871">exact excellent example of a guy who</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="3.93">goes out on the streets and does healing</text>
  <text start="362.13" dur="4.17">I learned a lot from Todd white when I</text>
  <text start="364.05" dur="4.35">first started learning about the</text>
  <text start="366.3" dur="5.79">miraculous I watched a lot of Todd white</text>
  <text start="368.4" dur="5.1">videos Todd really inspired me to go</text>
  <text start="372.09" dur="7.41">after it and go out and get people</text>
  <text start="373.5" dur="9.75">healed so there&amp;#39;s no reason why you</text>
  <text start="379.5" dur="5.639">can&amp;#39;t do that and there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="383.25" dur="3.87">people who do this I mean Randy Clark</text>
  <text start="385.139" dur="3.601">teaches on it Bill Johnson teaches on it</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="3.299">Bethel Church is really good they have a</text>
  <text start="388.74" dur="3.39">ministry where they teach people to go</text>
  <text start="390.419" dur="5.791">out onto the into the streets and malls</text>
  <text start="392.13" dur="6.569">and get people healed so there are some</text>
  <text start="396.21" dur="4.44">people teaching in this but it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="398.699" dur="4.56">few yes</text>
  <text start="400.65" dur="5.01">is amazing Todd&amp;#39;s heart for people and</text>
  <text start="403.259" dur="5.611">Todd&amp;#39;s understanding of God his ISM is</text>
  <text start="405.66" dur="4.14">incredible Todd is a true role model but</text>
  <text start="408.87" dur="5.43">you know there&amp;#39;s something else to</text>
  <text start="409.8" dur="6.45">consider in most major cities there is a</text>
  <text start="414.3" dur="3.54">school for the blind I&amp;#39;m sorry not a</text>
  <text start="416.25" dur="3.93">school for the blind a library for the</text>
  <text start="417.84" dur="5.97">blind where they have books that are in</text>
  <text start="420.18" dur="5.37">Braille for blind people to go and check</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="6.66">out books and read them now think about</text>
  <text start="425.55" dur="6.89">this if you learned to operate in the</text>
  <text start="430.47" dur="5.94">power of God for healing and miracles</text>
  <text start="432.44" dur="6.22">you could go to the local library for</text>
  <text start="436.41" dur="4.44">the blind sit outside that library and</text>
  <text start="438.66" dur="8.61">you could get people healed all day long</text>
  <text start="440.85" dur="9.629">if you wanted to if you wanted to that</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="6.079">is an option that is in front of all of</text>
  <text start="450.479" dur="6.271">us all right</text>
  <text start="453.349" dur="7.57">so Jesus sent His disciples out two by</text>
  <text start="456.75" dur="5.84">two and have you ever asked yourself why</text>
  <text start="460.919" dur="4.651">did he sent out his disciples two by two</text>
  <text start="462.59" dur="5.41">well there are some practical reasons</text>
  <text start="465.57" dur="7.08">why he may have done that one of which</text>
  <text start="468" dur="6.57">is pride if you see a lot of miracles if</text>
  <text start="472.65" dur="4.079">you see people healed and you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="474.57" dur="3.599">it all yourself it&amp;#39;s easy to get lifted</text>
  <text start="476.729" dur="4.111">up when pride and think it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="478.169" dur="4.53">me I&amp;#39;m the one who&amp;#39;s doing it but if you</text>
  <text start="480.84" dur="4.139">are going out and doing ministry with a</text>
  <text start="482.699" dur="6.361">partner like your wife or your husband</text>
  <text start="484.979" dur="7.171">or a friend and you&amp;#39;re both laying hands</text>
  <text start="489.06" dur="4.65">on someone and that person gets healed</text>
  <text start="492.15" dur="5.54">you don&amp;#39;t really know if it was you or</text>
  <text start="493.71" dur="7.489">if it was them your friend two by two</text>
  <text start="497.69" dur="6.4">kind of splits up the responsibility and</text>
  <text start="501.199" dur="4.991">the glory and really the the glory goes</text>
  <text start="504.09" dur="3.93">to God but it is easy to think after</text>
  <text start="506.19" dur="6.149">you&amp;#39;ve seen some miracles that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="508.02" dur="7.259">the one who is the top dog so going out</text>
  <text start="512.339" dur="6.211">two by two in groups of people can help</text>
  <text start="515.279" dur="5.361">deal with the pride issue the other</text>
  <text start="518.55" dur="5.489">thing is obedience</text>
  <text start="520.64" dur="5.56">sometimes when you&amp;#39;re supposed to go out</text>
  <text start="524.039" dur="3.781">and heal somebody you may struggle with</text>
  <text start="526.2" dur="3.06">obedience now I don&amp;#39;t really want to</text>
  <text start="527.82" dur="3.75">pray for this person I don&amp;#39;t really want</text>
  <text start="529.26" dur="3.449">to do this I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m not in the mood I</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="2.46">don&amp;#39;t feel like praying for that person</text>
  <text start="532.709" dur="3.961">but if you&amp;#39;re with a</text>
  <text start="534.03" dur="11.22">that partner kind of becomes like a</text>
  <text start="536.67" dur="10.17">responsibility or a a person who holds</text>
  <text start="545.25" dur="4.77">you accountable sorry accountability</text>
  <text start="546.84" dur="4.68">partner who you&amp;#39;re accountable to if you</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="3.99">are supposed to go out with them and</text>
  <text start="551.52" dur="5.31">they know that you can release healing</text>
  <text start="554.01" dur="4.77">you can&amp;#39;t is easily kind of weasel out</text>
  <text start="556.83" dur="5.46">of praying for somebody if you have an</text>
  <text start="558.78" dur="7.32">accountability partner so it also helps</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="5.94">obedience and it helps consistency there</text>
  <text start="566.1" dur="3.81">are days when you&amp;#39;re gonna be out</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="4.44">praying for people and you&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="569.91" dur="4.8">have the faith that you did had</text>
  <text start="572.67" dur="5.61">yesterday for whatever reason your faith</text>
  <text start="574.71" dur="6.18">may lapse you may be full of doubt and</text>
  <text start="578.28" dur="5.73">unbelief but if you have a person who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="580.89" dur="6.06">with you or two or three people that are</text>
  <text start="584.01" dur="5.07">with you even if one person is kind of</text>
  <text start="586.95" dur="4.34">lacking faith there&amp;#39;s a good chance that</text>
  <text start="589.08" dur="5.1">the other person or the other people</text>
  <text start="591.29" dur="6.01">will be filled with faith and they will</text>
  <text start="594.18" dur="5.52">be able to release the power and to</text>
  <text start="597.3" dur="5.7">exercise authority so you&amp;#39;ll also have</text>
  <text start="599.7" dur="7.02">better consistency if you go out with a</text>
  <text start="603" dur="6.35">group of people and to that point Bethel</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="5.61">Church in California came up with a</text>
  <text start="609.35" dur="5.53">program they called treasure hunts where</text>
  <text start="612.33" dur="5.4">you get a group of people and you sit</text>
  <text start="614.88" dur="4.68">down and you pray and you ask the Lord</text>
  <text start="617.73" dur="4.11">to give you words of knowledge about</text>
  <text start="619.56" dur="5.91">specific people places to go people to</text>
  <text start="621.84" dur="7.38">find and as a group you go find those</text>
  <text start="625.47" dur="5.22">people in your community you walk up to</text>
  <text start="629.22" dur="3.57">them ask if you can pray for them</text>
  <text start="630.69" dur="3.99">introduce yourself hey you know we&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="632.79" dur="4.44">bunch of students from this church we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="634.68" dur="4.47">out practicing how to heal we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="637.23" dur="5.19">learning to hear God&amp;#39;s voice we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="639.15" dur="5.36">learning to release power and you pray</text>
  <text start="642.42" dur="4.74">for people when watch them get healed</text>
  <text start="644.51" dur="5.29">working with a group of people like this</text>
  <text start="647.16" dur="6.15">doing what they call treasure hunts is a</text>
  <text start="649.8" dur="5.91">good way for inexperienced people to</text>
