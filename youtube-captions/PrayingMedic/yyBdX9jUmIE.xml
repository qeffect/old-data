  <text start="198.25" dur="5.89">difficulties at work and our personal</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="4.53">lives and we were becoming very hostile</text>
  <text start="204.14" dur="3.84">towards each other and it was primarily</text>
  <text start="206.48" dur="3.6">due to the fact that i was becoming a</text>
  <text start="207.98" dur="4.89">really proud arrogant what was called</text>
  <text start="210.08" dur="3.93">paragon a person who thinks they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="212.87" dur="5.25">do anything wrong and they&amp;#39;re always</text>

  <text start="230.18" dur="6.15">probably check it out it&amp;#39;s called left</text>
  <text start="232.459" dur="4.981">behind and I didn&amp;#39;t know anything about</text>
  <text start="236.33" dur="2.67">the book and I told him I didn&amp;#39;t read</text>
  <text start="237.44" dur="2.94">fiction books but he said you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239" dur="2.61">a really interesting book it talks a lot</text>
  <text start="240.38" dur="2.1">about current events that are going out</text>
  <text start="241.61" dur="2.849">of the world you might find it</text>
  <text start="242.48" dur="4.83">interesting so I thought you know</text>
  <text start="244.459" dur="6.961">whatever i&amp;#39;m not going to read it so a</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="7.62">couple of weeks later I was I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="251.42" dur="4.89">scheduled to work a 48 hour shift and at</text>
  <text start="254.93" dur="4.14">the time I was working on the busiest</text>
  <text start="256.31" dur="4.44">medic unit in the county and I was</text>
  <text start="259.07" dur="3.06">working with moral day weekend 48 hour</text>
  <text start="260.75" dur="4.38">shift which is one of the busiest</text>
  <text start="262.13" dur="5.75">weekend&amp;#39;s of the year so I was expecting</text>
  <text start="265.13" dur="6.51">to be very busy running a lot of calls</text>
  <text start="267.88" dur="5.08">but before I went in for shift I thought</text>
  <text start="271.64" dur="5.16">on the off chance that it might be a</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="6.42">slow day I would pick up well let me</text>
  <text start="276.8" dur="5.16">back up a second so my lieutenant a</text>
  <text start="279.38" dur="4.8">couple of days before I worked this this</text>
  <text start="281.96" dur="2.4">forty eight-hour shift told me that he</text>
  <text start="284.18" dur="2.07">was</text>
  <text start="284.36" dur="3.239">reading a really interesting book that</text>

  <text start="292.969" dur="4.32">of cool stuff in it I thought one of the</text>
  <text start="295.31" dur="5.579">odds at two different people would talk</text>
  <text start="297.289" dur="5.1">to me about the same book so I again I</text>

  <text start="302.389" dur="7.141">fiction books and not interested so I</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="4.359">kind of blew it off but then the day</text>

  <text start="499.09" dur="5.28">kind of evangelical Bible teaching</text>
  <text start="501.669" dur="6.931">church for about seven years I learned</text>
  <text start="504.37" dur="7.88">the word really well and but God had a</text>
  <text start="508.6" dur="6.689">plan for me that involved some</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="4.479">interesting turns along the way one of</text>
  <text start="515.289" dur="6.541">which was me getting kicked out of the</text>
  <text start="516.729" dur="6.81">church that was going to uh through an</text>
  <text start="521.83" dur="6.36">interesting set of circumstances which</text>
  <text start="523.539" dur="8.521">it could be for another podcast and then</text>
  <text start="528.19" dur="6.27">I try to get back into the you know the</text>
  <text start="532.06" dur="4.2">four walled institutional Church kind of</text>
  <text start="534.46" dur="4.08">setting because I just felt like it</text>

  <text start="542.38" dur="4.53">where I couldn&amp;#39;t go like right now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="544.72" dur="3.75">working on the weekends and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="546.91" dur="4.47">hard for me to go to church services so</text>
  <text start="548.47" dur="3.45">he started teaching me through dreams</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="3.3">well</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="5.94">in 2008 I had the first dream that I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="554.68" dur="7.17">had in probably 25 years I just never</text>
  <text start="557.86" dur="9.27">had dreams as an adult and on august</text>
  <text start="561.85" dur="8.52">eighth of 2008 so 880 a new beginnings</text>
  <text start="567.13" dur="5.759">exactly I actually had some kind of</text>
  <text start="570.37" dur="4.5">prophetic understanding a couple of</text>
  <text start="572.889" dur="4.5">weeks prior to that date that something</text>
  <text start="574.87" dur="5.339">was going to happen on 8808 I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="577.389" dur="4.411">know what it was but I knew in my no er</text>
  <text start="580.209" dur="4.801">I knew that something was going to</text>
  <text start="581.8" dur="4.229">happen I just had this kind of strange</text>
  <text start="585.01" dur="5.16">sense that something was going to happen</text>
  <text start="586.029" dur="7.351">well I&amp;#39;m that night on 8808 God appeared</text>
  <text start="590.17" dur="5.159">to me in a dream for the first is the</text>
  <text start="593.38" dur="3.42">first dream I had in 25 years and was</text>
  <text start="595.329" dur="4.95">very similar to how he appeared to</text>
  <text start="596.8" dur="4.38">Solomon where he basically appeared to</text>
  <text start="600.279" dur="4.74">him in a dream and had a conversation</text>
  <text start="601.18" dur="5.49">with him so what he said to me was I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="605.019" dur="3.18">going to show you what&amp;#39;s wrong with your</text>
  <text start="606.67" dur="5.31">patients and I want you to pray with</text>
  <text start="608.199" dur="5.76">them and if you do I&amp;#39;ll heal them now</text>
  <text start="611.98" dur="4.14">this is a guy who did not believe in</text>
  <text start="613.959" dur="4.62">healing and miracles so even though I</text>
  <text start="616.12" dur="4.469">had been studying the Bible I had been</text>
  <text start="618.579" dur="4.231">in kind of a church mindset where</text>
  <text start="620.589" dur="4.141">healing and miracles ceased that was</text>
  <text start="622.81" dur="3.389">only during the first century there were</text>

  <text start="626.199" dur="4.83">anybody healed I&amp;#39;d never read of</text>
  <text start="628.54" dur="4.89">legitimate testimony of a miracle I was</text>
  <text start="631.029" dur="4.231">very very skeptical and even though I</text>
  <text start="633.43" dur="5.399">was a believer I was an unbelieving</text>
  <text start="635.26" dur="5.46">believer really so I didn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="638.829" dur="3.63">God was had planned he said he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="640.72" dur="3.84">to show me what&amp;#39;s wrong with my patients</text>
  <text start="642.459" dur="3.331">and I was thinking how dear exactly are</text>
  <text start="644.56" dur="3.51">you going to show me what&amp;#39;s wrong with</text>
  <text start="645.79" dur="5.93">my patients because I&amp;#39;ve never had a</text>
  <text start="648.07" dur="7.17">vision before either so over the next</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="5.59">six months to a year I went through an</text>
  <text start="655.24" dur="5.849">intense training course from the Holy</text>
  <text start="657.31" dur="6.66">Spirit on how to see visions and how to</text>
  <text start="661.089" dur="6.841">cooperate with him in words of knowledge</text>
  <text start="663.97" dur="6.96">and how to release the power of the Holy</text>
  <text start="667.93" dur="6">Spirit to young people and it involved</text>
  <text start="670.93" dur="5.399">me reluctantly starting to pray for my</text>
  <text start="673.93" dur="5.909">patients for the first month or two I</text>
  <text start="676.329" dur="4.861">did it quietly secretly no one could</text>
  <text start="679.839" dur="3.06">hear me I didn&amp;#39;t ask the patient&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="681.19" dur="3.42">just you know kind of whispered lara</text>
  <text start="682.899" dur="4.021">fits your well please</text>

  <text start="686.92" dur="5.97">prayers you know never got anybody</text>
  <text start="688.87" dur="6.18">healed I prayed that way I made a deal</text>
  <text start="692.89" dur="5.73">with God I said look I&amp;#39;ll pray with</text>
  <text start="695.05" dur="5.06">every patient you know this month or</text>
  <text start="698.62" dur="4.05">I&amp;#39;ll pray I shouldn&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;ll pray for</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="4.479">every patient for a month but i want i</text>
  <text start="702.67" dur="4.409">want to see somebody healed so I prayed</text>
  <text start="704.589" dur="3.99">for like probably two or three patients</text>
  <text start="707.079" dur="3.601">a day every day for a month and nobody</text>
  <text start="708.579" dur="3.721">was healed so I thought okay god I got</text>
  <text start="710.68" dur="3.3">you where I want you you said if I</text>
  <text start="712.3" dur="3.3">prayed for people you&amp;#39;d heal them and</text>
  <text start="713.98" dur="5.25">nobody got healed so I am out of this</text>
  <text start="715.6" dur="5.88">deal you just broke the contract I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="719.23" dur="4.32">gonna go back out about my life well it</text>
  <text start="721.48" dur="5.13">wasn&amp;#39;t that easy because at the time he</text>
  <text start="723.55" dur="5.07">was giving me all these dreams so I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="726.61" dur="4.289">come home frustrated one day from work</text>
  <text start="728.62" dur="3.45">not seeing anybody healed and he&amp;#39;d give</text>
  <text start="730.899" dur="2.731">me a dream where I was praying for</text>
  <text start="732.07" dur="6.06">somebody in the ambulance and they were</text>
  <text start="733.63" dur="7.38">getting healed and then I&amp;#39;d be like okay</text>
  <text start="738.13" dur="4.649">great this is awesome so I&amp;#39;m i go back</text>
  <text start="741.01" dur="3.35">to work i pray for some more people</text>
  <text start="742.779" dur="3.511">quietly and nobody would get healed and</text>
  <text start="744.36" dur="4.479">this went on for a while but then i</text>
  <text start="746.29" dur="4.44">actually started reading some books i</text>
  <text start="748.839" dur="3.601">read a book called power healing by john</text>
  <text start="750.73" dur="5.099">limber which was really inspiring and</text>
  <text start="752.44" dur="5.73">john we got the big revelation that God</text>
  <text start="755.829" dur="4.141">said look you need to command people to</text>
  <text start="758.17" dur="3.39">be healed don&amp;#39;t beg me to heal anyone</text>
  <text start="759.97" dur="3.84">just you need to use the authority and</text>
  <text start="761.56" dur="3.99">the power I&amp;#39;ve given you step out and</text>
  <text start="763.81" dur="4.35">command that sickness to leave in</text>
  <text start="765.55" dur="4.44">command those joints to be healed so</text>
  <text start="768.16" dur="3.45">that was a radical idea for John Weber</text>
  <text start="769.99" dur="3.69">and when I started reading that stuff I</text>
  <text start="771.61" dur="6.089">thought wow really commanding healing</text>
  <text start="773.68" dur="6.149">how does that work so um I reluctantly</text>
  <text start="777.699" dur="5.88">started following this new way of doing</text>
  <text start="779.829" dur="5.281">and I was commanding joints to leave our</text>
  <text start="783.579" dur="3.45">joints to be healed and spirits of pain</text>
  <text start="785.11" dur="3.78">to leave and started commanding migraine</text>
  <text start="787.029" dur="3.93">headaches to leave and strangely enough</text>
  <text start="788.89" dur="5.52">it worked I started saying a lot of</text>
  <text start="790.959" dur="5.731">equity and then it took me a while to</text>
  <text start="794.41" dur="6.119">understand this idea of power and</text>
  <text start="796.69" dur="5.339">authority that God has given us so then</text>
  <text start="800.529" dur="4.081">of course I had all these fears about</text>
  <text start="802.029" dur="4.021">okay I&amp;#39;m going to lose my job someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="804.61" dur="3.81">going to complain about me praying with</text>
  <text start="806.05" dur="4.68">people and having to get fired because I</text>
  <text start="808.42" dur="4.95">was I started then openly just asking</text>
  <text start="810.73" dur="4.38">people in the ambulance hey you know I</text>
  <text start="813.37" dur="4.709">believe God wants you to be healed can I</text>
  <text start="815.11" dur="3.389">pray for you and I would pray for people</text>
  <text start="818.079" dur="2.01">and</text>
  <text start="818.499" dur="5.4">a lot of them started to get healed</text>
  <text start="820.089" dur="7.68">probably had after doing this for about</text>
  <text start="823.899" dur="7.17">a couple of years I started seeing 75 to</text>
  <text start="827.769" dur="5.28">80 percent of people being healed it</text>
  <text start="831.069" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a learning curve to it but you</text>
  <text start="833.049" dur="4.41">can get a pretty decent success rate</text>
  <text start="834.789" dur="4.11">once you kind of start to understand</text>
  <text start="837.459" dur="4.47">what cooperating with the Holy Spirit is</text>
  <text start="838.899" dur="5.91">like but they eventually I did get a</text>
  <text start="841.929" dur="4.26">complaint from someone and it wasn&amp;#39;t one</text>
  <text start="844.809" dur="4.26">of my patients it was actually a nurse</text>
  <text start="846.189" dur="5.94">in the ER at one of the hospitals i was</text>
  <text start="849.069" dur="5.25">in she complained to her manager that I</text>
  <text start="852.129" dur="4.23">was trying to proselytize one of the my</text>
  <text start="854.319" dur="3.32">patients she saw me praying with the guy</text>
  <text start="856.359" dur="4.44">she thought I was trying to you know</text>
  <text start="857.639" dur="5.59">lead him Jesus or something in the ER so</text>
  <text start="860.799" dur="4.8">I got a call to go into my boss&amp;#39;s office</text>
  <text start="863.229" dur="4.86">and he said so I got a complaint it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="865.599" dur="5.16">you know from a nurse says you&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="868.089" dur="5.99">to proselytize your patients what&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="870.759" dur="5.43">all about and so I had to explain to him</text>
  <text start="874.079" dur="6.07">and I was very honest with him i said</text>
  <text start="876.189" dur="6.51">look Scott I said here&amp;#39;s the deal I had</text>
  <text start="880.149" dur="4.59">a conversation with God and no I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="882.699" dur="4.2">crazy and he said he wants me to pray</text>
  <text start="884.739" dur="4.56">with people and see city&amp;#39;s going to heal</text>
  <text start="886.899" dur="5.67">them and and I have seen a lot of people</text>
  <text start="889.299" dur="5.37">healed everybody that I&amp;#39;ve prayed for</text>
  <text start="892.569" dur="4.47">has been very grateful even the two or</text>
  <text start="894.669" dur="3.75">three people who said no and this is</text>
  <text start="897.039" dur="3.84">something that&amp;#39;s was really interesting</text>
  <text start="898.419" dur="4.44">to me I&amp;#39;ve probably prayed for in the</text>
  <text start="900.879" dur="3.33">neighborhood of I don&amp;#39;t know two or</text>
  <text start="902.859" dur="4.62">three thousand people in the ambulance</text>
  <text start="904.209" dur="5.67">in the last two years I&amp;#39;ve had probably</text>
  <text start="907.479" dur="4.23">three people say no no thank you and</text>
  <text start="909.879" dur="5.1">they were very polite about it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="911.709" dur="5.31">very nice nobody complained but almost</text>
  <text start="914.979" dur="4.08">ninety nine probably ninety nine percent</text>
  <text start="917.019" dur="4.53">of the people I ask if they want me to</text>
  <text start="919.059" dur="4.32">pray with them say yes which was very</text>
  <text start="921.549" dur="5.97">surprising i expected most people to say</text>
  <text start="923.379" dur="5.49">no right uh I almost have to stop you</text>
  <text start="927.519" dur="2.85">because there&amp;#39;s so many things that are</text>
  <text start="928.869" dur="6.69">going in my head as you&amp;#39;re telling that</text>
  <text start="930.369" dur="6.65">story yeah well all the questions that I</text>
  <text start="935.559" dur="3.24">know that you&amp;#39;re that you&amp;#39;re wondering</text>
  <text start="937.019" dur="3.39">people have asked me over the years</text>
  <text start="938.799" dur="4.35">you&amp;#39;re like wait a minute wait a minute</text>
  <text start="940.409" dur="5.77">continue honestly like actually they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="943.149" dur="5.97">like recoup how effort what are the</text>
  <text start="946.179" dur="4.74">ethical guidelines how do you like these</text>
  <text start="949.119" dur="3.21">arguments with people about their faith</text>
  <text start="950.919" dur="3.84">their beliefs in your beliefs</text>
  <text start="952.329" dur="4.38">some and stuff like that I mean because</text>
  <text start="954.759" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s the concern that everybody has</text>
  <text start="956.709" dur="5.61">who wants to you know like use the power</text>
  <text start="960.489" dur="3.27">of the holy spirit and to be Jesus to</text>
  <text start="962.319" dur="3.81">their customers and their clients and</text>
  <text start="963.759" dur="4.74">their patients they think well you know</text>
  <text start="966.129" dur="3.81">this is has to be confined you know to</text>
  <text start="968.499" dur="4.08">like ministry times or at church</text>
  <text start="969.939" dur="6.36">meetings or whatever and I have learned</text>
  <text start="972.579" dur="6.57">no it does not you know it&amp;#39;s especially</text>
  <text start="976.299" dur="4.2">true in health care because this is and</text>
  <text start="979.149" dur="3.78">this is what God showed me he said look</text>
  <text start="980.499" dur="4.68">I don&amp;#39;t want you to evangelize people</text>
  <text start="982.929" dur="4.95">you&amp;#39;re not an evangelist you&amp;#39;re a healer</text>
  <text start="985.179" dur="4.741">so just get he look you&amp;#39;re in a setting</text>

  <text start="993.069" dur="3.36">people I want you to take away their</text>
  <text start="994.569" dur="5.161">pain and sickness and disease that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="996.429" dur="6.541">I want you to do and and I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="999.73" dur="4.709">several dreams where I&amp;#39;ll tell you about</text>
  <text start="1002.97" dur="3.269">this one dream I was in an emergency</text>
  <text start="1004.439" dur="5.13">department and I was praying for</text>
  <text start="1006.239" dur="6.241">patients in the ER and I was praying for</text>
  <text start="1009.569" dur="4.89">a doctor a child and somebody else and</text>
  <text start="1012.48" dur="3.569">the doctor had like some kind of tennis</text>
  <text start="1014.459" dur="3.09">elbow or bursitis in his elbow or</text>
  <text start="1016.049" dur="2.82">something and I was praying for him and</text>
  <text start="1017.549" dur="3.48">there was a child who was sick and I was</text>
  <text start="1018.869" dur="6.15">praying for the child in the dream I</text>
  <text start="1021.029" dur="6.78">knew that healing was a secondary goal</text>
  <text start="1025.019" dur="5.491">of what I was doing the primary goal is</text>
  <text start="1027.809" dur="7.47">that I was supposed to introduce them to</text>
  <text start="1030.51" dur="7.289">God&amp;#39;s presence so that&amp;#39;s what I do a lot</text>
  <text start="1035.279" dur="4.65">of is actually whenever I pray for</text>
  <text start="1037.799" dur="5.071">someone the first thing I tell them or</text>
  <text start="1039.929" dur="5.85">at first thing I do is I say holy spirit</text>
  <text start="1042.87" dur="4.23">bring your presence and and I have</text>
  <text start="1045.779" dur="3.87">learned how to cooperate with the Holy</text>
  <text start="1047.1" dur="4.59">Spirit to where his presence will come</text>
  <text start="1049.649" dur="4.321">into the ambulance and they&amp;#39;ll feel his</text>
  <text start="1051.69" dur="4.859">presence they either feel tingling all</text>
  <text start="1053.97" dur="6.089">over their body or they feel joy or they</text>
  <text start="1056.549" dur="5.76">feel overwhelming sense of peace that</text>
  <text start="1060.059" dur="5.311">they usually feel something different</text>
  <text start="1062.309" dur="5.1">and when they start to feel that I get</text>
  <text start="1065.37" dur="3.809">to tell them like well that&amp;#39;s God he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1067.409" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s here in the ambulance with you and</text>
  <text start="1069.179" dur="4.261">he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s bringing his presence because</text>
  <text start="1071.159" dur="5.191">he wants to I pray for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1073.44" dur="5.79">with depression and who are suicidal and</text>
  <text start="1076.35" dur="4.86">the one thing they almost always feel</text>
  <text start="1079.23" dur="4.5">right away is this overwhelming sense of</text>
  <text start="1081.21" dur="4.23">peace the fear and anxiety leave and</text>
  <text start="1083.73" dur="2.79">then I tell them well you know Jesus is</text>
  <text start="1085.44" dur="2.97">the Prince of Peace</text>
  <text start="1086.52" dur="3.15">and he&amp;#39;s here right now he&amp;#39;s with you</text>

  <text start="1092.55" dur="5.73">people to to the Lord in a way that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1096.51" dur="3.66">tangible where they can feel that he&amp;#39;s</text>
