  <text start="137.38" dur="6.93">good so we had the French election today</text>
  <text start="141.61" dur="4.35">and marine lepen was a longshot and a</text>
  <text start="144.31" dur="5.1">lot of us conservatives were kind of</text>
  <text start="145.96" dur="5.07">hoping that lepen would get in because</text>
  <text start="149.41" dur="6.66">we see her kind of as a female Donald</text>
  <text start="151.03" dur="8.13">Trump she&amp;#39;s a patriot some people would</text>
  <text start="156.07" dur="6.12">call her a nationalist and some people</text>
  <text start="159.16" dur="4.68">would call her a Nazi or uh you know</text>
  <text start="162.19" dur="5.84">whatever</text>
  <text start="163.84" dur="6.78">I don&amp;#39;t even though marine lepen father</text>
  <text start="168.03" dur="7.87">was definitely a white nationalist</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="9.45">racist I don&amp;#39;t see that in lepen I see</text>
  <text start="175.9" dur="6.95">her as more of a a populist and more of</text>
  <text start="180.07" dur="5.49">a just a patriot who loves her country</text>
  <text start="182.85" dur="5.08">lesser country loves the culture love</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="4.37">was what it stands for and hates to see</text>
  <text start="187.93" dur="6.48">what is happening to it being destroyed</text>
  <text start="189.93" dur="8.77">so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a sin to hate</text>
  <text start="194.41" dur="8.43">watching your country destroyed that</text>
  <text start="198.7" dur="5.88">that makes you a patriot all right what</text>
  <text start="202.84" dur="3.27">did the prophets of the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="204.58" dur="4.71">what did the prophets of the Old</text>
  <text start="206.11" dur="7.41">Testament do they were Patriots they</text>
  <text start="209.29" dur="6.87">wanted to see Israel blessed and being</text>
  <text start="213.52" dur="6.86">prosperous and walking in righteousness</text>
  <text start="216.16" dur="7.32">and following God&amp;#39;s commands were worthy</text>
  <text start="220.38" dur="5.609">were the patriarchs the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="223.48" dur="8.61">prophets were they racist</text>
  <text start="225.989" dur="8.291">were they Nazis no they were Patriots</text>
  <text start="232.09" dur="3.66">they loved Israel and they want and they</text>
  <text start="234.28" dur="4.92">knew that God loved Israel and they</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="5.55">wanted to see Israel blessed and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.2" dur="6.63">that&amp;#39;s patriotism if you get that you</text>
  <text start="241.3" dur="8.85">get that if you don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t so I see</text>
  <text start="245.83" dur="9.21">I see loo marine lepen as a patriot okay</text>

  <text start="366.22" dur="7.949">of american politics there is a pendulum</text>
  <text start="370.12" dur="7.26">of public consensus in politics it</text>
  <text start="374.169" dur="5.881">swings back and forth from left to right</text>
  <text start="377.38" dur="6.03">from conservative to liberal it&amp;#39;s back</text>
  <text start="380.05" dur="5.67">and for you like this shirt that&amp;#39;s hey</text>
  <text start="383.41" dur="5.789">come on I&amp;#39;m in Phoenix it&amp;#39;s almost</text>

  <text start="403.03" dur="10.72">what&amp;#39;s going on Leslie hey my neighbor</text>
  <text start="405.95" dur="11.1">Leslie is on Facebook so pendulum swings</text>
  <text start="413.75" dur="4.56">back and forth from left to right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.05" dur="4.29">kind of funny before</text>
  <text start="418.31" dur="6.09">our elections this fall I had a Facebook</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="6.5">friend who predicted we would never</text>
  <text start="424.4" dur="8.12">again have a conservative Republican</text>
  <text start="427.84" dur="7.06">president he honestly thought that the</text>
  <text start="432.52" dur="5.59">Republicans would never again hold</text>
  <text start="434.9" dur="6.18">presidential office and I was thinking</text>
  <text start="438.11" dur="4.95">wow dude you don&amp;#39;t know how I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="441.08" dur="4.32">how old the guy was but I&amp;#39;m like you</text>
  <text start="443.06" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t understand that like you have</text>
  <text start="445.4" dur="3.27">conservatives in office for a while and</text>
  <text start="447.08" dur="3.42">then people get tired of that and then</text>
  <text start="448.67" dur="2.7">they want to have liberals they get</text>
  <text start="450.5" dur="2.49">tired of that and I want to have</text>
  <text start="451.37" dur="4.38">conservatives and it goes back and forth</text>
  <text start="452.99" dur="5.79">that&amp;#39;s how history is that is how the</text>
  <text start="455.75" dur="4.11">cycle of politics goes if you get tired</text>
  <text start="458.78" dur="5.4">of what they have and they want</text>
  <text start="459.86" dur="7.83">something else so so we have to</text>
  <text start="464.18" dur="11.9">understand that look at American history</text>
  <text start="467.69" dur="12.51">in the last 50 years in the 60s we had a</text>
  <text start="476.08" dur="11.1">flip-flop of conservative and liberal</text>
  <text start="480.2" dur="9.66">presidents John Kennedy LBJ Nixon Carter</text>
  <text start="487.18" dur="5.53">Nixon conservative Carter very liberal</text>
  <text start="489.86" dur="6.66">Reagan very conservative okay</text>
  <text start="492.71" dur="6.39">Oh Clinton very liberal so you had this</text>
  <text start="496.52" dur="4.83">continual going back and forth from</text>
  <text start="499.1" dur="4.07">conservative to liberal when you look at</text>
  <text start="501.35" dur="5.37">political cycles that&amp;#39;s what you see</text>
  <text start="503.17" dur="5.68">that is what you get in politics you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="506.72" dur="4.97">have either</text>
  <text start="508.85" dur="5.97">you&amp;#39;ll have conservatives and liberals</text>
  <text start="511.69" dur="4.779">switching control because the people get</text>
  <text start="514.82" dur="3">tired of what they have it works for a</text>
  <text start="516.469" dur="6.091">while and then it doesn&amp;#39;t work and then</text>
  <text start="517.82" dur="8.16">they switch back so the only question is</text>
  <text start="522.56" dur="5.55">how long does it take the switch to</text>
  <text start="525.98" dur="3.81">happen how long does it take the</text>
  <text start="528.11" dur="4.49">pendulum to swing in from one direction</text>
  <text start="529.79" dur="7.099">and go back to the other</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="6.929">that is what determines if a president</text>
  <text start="536.889" dur="9.68">gets reelected or has a long term in</text>
  <text start="539.529" dur="10.92">office or a short term in office okay so</text>
  <text start="546.569" dur="5.291">when you us as Americans most of us look</text>
  <text start="550.449" dur="3.841">at what&amp;#39;s happening in Europe and think</text>
  <text start="551.86" dur="6.589">what are these people thinking they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="9.33">their continent is getting destroyed</text>
  <text start="558.449" dur="6.76">rioting murder rape it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s out</text>
  <text start="563.62" dur="4.199">of control and then you throw in the</text>
  <text start="565.209" dur="4.351">economic problems their economy is</text>
  <text start="567.819" dur="3.781">crashed it&amp;#39;s toast</text>
  <text start="569.56" dur="3.48">a European Central Bank is on the verge</text>
  <text start="571.6" dur="3.09">of collapse</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="5.549">they have no economic growth they have</text>
  <text start="574.69" dur="5.25">massive debt and you were as Americans</text>
  <text start="578.589" dur="4.8">or sitting or thinking what are you</text>
  <text start="579.94" dur="7.41">people thinking well here is what we</text>
  <text start="583.389" dur="6.62">have to remember okay the pendulum is</text>
  <text start="587.35" dur="8.7">swinging in one direction or the other</text>
  <text start="590.009" dur="8.291">okay as long as the the liberals the</text>
  <text start="596.05" dur="4.789">Socialists are in control in Europe</text>
  <text start="598.3" dur="6.45">they&amp;#39;re going to be for open borders and</text>
  <text start="600.839" dur="7.661">socialism and let the let the government</text>
  <text start="604.75" dur="6.029">tax people to death take that tax money</text>
  <text start="608.5" dur="7.62">give them health care give them whatever</text>
  <text start="610.779" dur="7.201">and eventually socialism always destroys</text>
  <text start="616.12" dur="3">itself it will always destroy a society</text>
  <text start="617.98" dur="7.44">wherever it goes</text>
  <text start="619.12" dur="9.48">that&amp;#39;s just how socialism works hey</text>
  <text start="625.42" dur="4.469">Merrick Margaret Thatcher socialism is</text>
  <text start="628.6" dur="3.839">great until you run out of other</text>
  <text start="629.889" dur="5.01">people&amp;#39;s money okay</text>
  <text start="632.439" dur="4.59">the secret to socialism is somebody else</text>
  <text start="634.899" dur="4.231">is always paying for what you&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="637.029" dur="3.66">when you run out of money and there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="639.13" dur="4.5">one else to pay for it socialism</text>
  <text start="640.689" dur="4.911">collapses society collapses and you see</text>
  <text start="643.63" dur="4.68">what&amp;#39;s going on in Venezuela right now</text>
  <text start="645.6" dur="6.729">socialism works great for a while and</text>
  <text start="648.31" dur="6.149">then it becomes a death spiral look at</text>
  <text start="652.329" dur="3.271">the Soviet Union look at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="654.459" dur="4.791">happening in Europe and look at</text>
  <text start="655.6" dur="3.65">Venezuela okay</text>
  <text start="659.66" dur="6.36">socialism is a is a nice fluffy idea</text>
  <text start="663.14" dur="4.41">that everybody gets evenly and nobody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="666.02" dur="5.1">going to get taken advantage of</text>
  <text start="667.55" dur="4.88">nice idea in theory doesn&amp;#39;t work out in</text>
  <text start="671.12" dur="7.89">actual practice</text>
  <text start="672.43" dur="9.82">okay that is why China is become a</text>
  <text start="679.01" dur="5.7">free-market capitalist society that is</text>
  <text start="682.25" dur="4.23">why Russia is now has been moving toward</text>
  <text start="684.71" dur="7.23">capitalism because they realized</text>
  <text start="686.48" dur="7.38">socialism isn&amp;#39;t working so what we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="691.94" dur="3.54">got is a we&amp;#39;ve got A&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="693.86" dur="13.14">political pendulum swinging from one</text>
  <text start="695.48" dur="13.44">direction to the other all right and you</text>
  <text start="707" dur="4.2">have to ask yourself which direction is</text>
  <text start="708.92" dur="3.39">going in Europe right now what happened</text>
  <text start="711.2" dur="5.58">with geert wilders</text>

  <text start="741.98" dur="5.58">moving away from the left away from</text>
  <text start="745.34" dur="5.88">socialism they&amp;#39;re moving in the</text>
  <text start="747.56" dur="5.85">direction of conservatism but a pendulum</text>
  <text start="751.22" dur="4.98">is in progress it&amp;#39;s swinging and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="753.41" dur="4.65">slow process but it&amp;#39;s swinging in the</text>
  <text start="756.2" dur="4.08">direction of its swinging to the right</text>
  <text start="758.06" dur="4.71">it&amp;#39;s swinging towards conservatism it</text>
  <text start="760.28" dur="5.25">hasn&amp;#39;t made it there yet it has there</text>
  <text start="762.77" dur="9.99">hasn&amp;#39;t been enough destruction and</text>

  <text start="2032.5" dur="6.11">election there was an interview with</text>
  <text start="2034.809" dur="8.161">helmet nor pause with Bill Mitchell</text>
  <text start="2038.61" dur="7.449">helmet is a statistician and a political</text>
  <text start="2042.97" dur="5.73">analyst and he has correctly predicted</text>
  <text start="2046.059" dur="6.84">every presidential election going back</text>
  <text start="2048.7" dur="7.229">to the fifties sixties all right they</text>
  <text start="2052.899" dur="5.97">used his formula retrograde and it</text>
  <text start="2055.929" dur="4.47">predicted elections going back for</text>
  <text start="2058.869" dur="3.571">almost a hundred years over a hundred</text>

  <text start="2062.44" dur="5.28">is helmet nor paws have made the</text>
  <text start="2065.109" dur="5.131">observation about political momentum</text>
  <text start="2067.72" dur="5.82">that the pendulum swings back and forth</text>
  <text start="2070.24" dur="5.849">and you can look at voter turnout you</text>

  <text start="2076.089" dur="3.99">at primaries and know ahead of time what</text>
  <text start="2078.639" dur="3.78">the election results are going to be and</text>

  <text start="2090.46" dur="7.74">victory this year and he predicted it</text>
  <text start="2093.369" dur="10.021">because of the political momentum he saw</text>
  <text start="2098.2" dur="7.76">that Obama got elected and had a smaller</text>

  <text start="2114.64" dur="5.82">elected and then his reelection numbers</text>

  <text start="2122.47" dur="6.869">in 2012 when Obama got reelected the</text>

  <text start="2662.47" dur="6.51">living with a hostile media that is</text>
  <text start="2665.17" dur="6.87">trying to take him out if you do not</text>
  <text start="2668.98" dur="6.99">understand by now that the mainstream</text>
  <text start="2672.04" dur="5.46">media job one is to destroy Trump and to</text>
  <text start="2675.97" dur="3.629">try to get him out of office and make</text>
  <text start="2677.5" dur="3.93">him look like an idiot you have not been</text>

  <text start="2684.73" dur="6.78">anything else they want Trump gone all</text>
  <text start="2687.849" dur="7.051">right so in the dream that I had last</text>
  <text start="2691.51" dur="6.3">night the media was going after the</text>
  <text start="2694.9" dur="4.5">president and they were criticizing what</text>
  <text start="2697.81" dur="3.45">he was saying and they were trying to</text>
  <text start="2699.4" dur="4.5">make him look like a fool and they were</text>
  <text start="2701.26" dur="9.059">trying to prove him wrong right</text>
  <text start="2703.9" dur="8.87">in the dream every time someone would</text>
  <text start="2710.319" dur="7.981">criticize something that Trump said he</text>
  <text start="2712.77" dur="8.11">would give three names the names of</text>
  <text start="2718.3" dur="6.21">three people who could verify the</text>
  <text start="2720.88" dur="7.17">accuracy of what he had just said and as</text>
  <text start="2724.51" dur="5.01">I woke up this morning I thought let</text>
  <text start="2728.05" dur="5.25">every word be established by the mouth</text>
  <text start="2729.52" dur="5.7">of two or three witnesses right as if</text>
  <text start="2733.3" dur="3.809">Jesus said that was kind of the Hebrew</text>
  <text start="2735.22" dur="4.02">tradition if you wanted to know the</text>
  <text start="2737.109" dur="4.891">truth of a matter if someone was accused</text>
  <text start="2739.24" dur="5.579">of doing something wrong you had to have</text>
  <text start="2742" dur="6">witnesses who could bear witness to the</text>
  <text start="2744.819" dur="5.27">truth or falsity of what you said and in</text>
  <text start="2748" dur="4.89">the dream Trump had three witnesses</text>
  <text start="2750.089" dur="6.28">three people that he gave names of who</text>
  <text start="2752.89" dur="4.01">would verify everything he said all</text>
  <text start="2756.369" dur="5.15">right</text>
  <text start="2756.9" dur="7.639">so I think this is something we can pray</text>
  <text start="2761.519" dur="5.461">into and here&amp;#39;s what we need to pray for</text>
  <text start="2764.539" dur="4.661">Trump is going to continue to be</text>
  <text start="2766.98" dur="4.289">assailed by the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2769.2" dur="8.069">going to continue to come after him they</text>
  <text start="2771.269" dur="7.59">think that their ace is criticizing him</text>
  <text start="2777.269" dur="2.401">and making him look stupid and making</text>
  <text start="2778.859" dur="4.89">him look like a fool</text>
  <text start="2779.67" dur="8.04">and I think what Trump has realized is</text>
  <text start="2783.749" dur="8.34">that&amp;#39;s actually a trap that he can set</text>
  <text start="2787.71" dur="9.359">to try to defeat the media look make no</text>
  <text start="2792.089" dur="7.381">mistake this is war Trump wants the</text>
  <text start="2797.069" dur="3.421">mainstream media gone as much as they</text>
  <text start="2799.47" dur="5.22">want him gone</text>

  <text start="4168.25" dur="6.69">rational personality type for a rational</text>
  <text start="4171.78" dur="6.16">everything has to make sense they get</text>
  <text start="4174.94" dur="6.32">rattled and angry when things don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="4177.94" dur="7.56">sense they&amp;#39;re rational they think in</text>
  <text start="4181.26" dur="6.13">terms of logic and they like to they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4185.5" dur="7.02">people who like to understand systems</text>
  <text start="4187.39" dur="7.29">and for them the bottom line is it needs</text>
  <text start="4192.52" dur="4.08">to make sense and here&amp;#39;s where here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4194.68" dur="5.34">where rational personality types and</text>
  <text start="4196.6" dur="7.8">Guardians clash because with Guardian</text>
  <text start="4200.02" dur="8.31">personality types they want customs</text>
  <text start="4204.4" dur="8.49">traditions and laws to be followed first</text>
  <text start="4208.33" dur="6.99">and whether or not it makes sense is a</text>
  <text start="4212.89" dur="4.89">secondary consideration for the rational</text>
  <text start="4215.32" dur="6.59">personality type it has to make sense</text>
  <text start="4217.78" dur="8.96">first and whether it&amp;#39;s legal moral</text>
  <text start="4221.91" dur="6.9">or ethical is secondary okay</text>
  <text start="4226.74" dur="6.09">and this is why people have</text>
  <text start="4228.81" dur="6.54">disagreements a person who is running a</text>
  <text start="4232.83" dur="3.33">business they say well I understand what</text>
  <text start="4235.35" dur="2.73">the law says</text>
  <text start="4236.16" dur="5.97">but that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="4238.08" dur="5.85">arbitrary law it&amp;#39;s illogical this is</text>
  <text start="4242.13" dur="4.56">what I&amp;#39;m going to do regardless of what</text>
  <text start="4243.93" dur="4.86">the statute or the regulation says that</text>
  <text start="4246.69" dur="4.2">is how a rational personality thinks</text>
  <text start="4248.79" dur="4.68">rationals have a difficult time doing</text>
  <text start="4250.89" dur="4.8">anything that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense it</text>
  <text start="4253.47" dur="6.27">isn&amp;#39;t logical even if it&amp;#39;s the law</text>
  <text start="4255.69" dur="6.3">or the customs or the society&amp;#39;s norms or</text>
  <text start="4259.74" dur="4.62">the way it&amp;#39;s always been done rationals</text>
  <text start="4261.99" dur="4.77">do not like to think in terms of the way</text>
  <text start="4264.36" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s always been done they want to do</text>
  <text start="4266.76" dur="5.67">things that make sense that&amp;#39;s a rational</text>
  <text start="4269.43" dur="5.4">personality type Guardians are always</text>
  <text start="4272.43" dur="4.47">worried about is it legal is it ethical</text>
  <text start="4274.83" dur="5.04">and is it moral whether or not it makes</text>
  <text start="4276.9" dur="5.07">sense you know look let&amp;#39;s just follow</text>
  <text start="4279.87" dur="4.71">the lot let&amp;#39;s just follow the way that</text>
  <text start="4281.97" dur="7.14">the book says let&amp;#39;s just do it that way</text>
  <text start="4284.58" dur="6.99">and so I find the study of personality</text>
  <text start="4289.11" dur="4.68">types very interesting because it</text>
  <text start="4291.57" dur="4.04">explains a lot of the wars and</text>
  <text start="4293.79" dur="4.5">disagreements that are going on on on</text>
  <text start="4295.61" dur="4.48">periscope but on Facebook people have</text>
  <text start="4298.29" dur="3.45">all these arguments why are you all</text>
  <text start="4300.09" dur="3.9">arguing why do you why can&amp;#39;t you see</text>
  <text start="4301.74" dur="5.04">things the same way because we all have</text>
  <text start="4303.99" dur="4.59">a different personality type and we view</text>
  <text start="4306.78" dur="3.66">the world differently and we view</text>
  <text start="4308.58" dur="4.62">ourselves differently we view our role</text>
