  <text start="199.62" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s got a little snippet of it and it</text>
  <text start="201.45" dur="4.8">looks really good from what I&amp;#39;ve read so</text>
  <text start="203.34" dur="4.979">far and I like storytelling and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="206.25" dur="3.629">gonna be putting out a fiction book here</text>
  <text start="208.319" dur="3.691">eventually if I ever get time to get</text>
  <text start="209.879" dur="4.76">working on it I finished up a book</text>
  <text start="212.01" dur="5.22">manuscript last night I&amp;#39;m so happy</text>
  <text start="214.639" dur="4.18">yeah this thing has been on my plate</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="3.36">forever and I finally finally got it</text>
  <text start="218.819" dur="5.25">done it&amp;#39;s actually the second book this</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="5.549">week I finished second I assume you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="224.069" dur="5.31">had them both on the go for a while yeah</text>
  <text start="226.139" dur="5.46">I had kind of an interesting surprise</text>
  <text start="229.379" dur="5">that the Holy Spirit laid on me a couple</text>
  <text start="231.599" dur="4.53">weeks ago I had written this paper on</text>
  <text start="234.379" dur="4.33">finance and economics</text>
  <text start="236.129" dur="5.341">I wrote it probably two years ago I</text>
  <text start="238.709" dur="4.5">think and I never intended to publish it</text>
  <text start="241.47" dur="4.439">as a book it was kind of an</text>
  <text start="243.209" dur="4.411">informational paper on finance and</text>
  <text start="245.909" dur="3.811">economics and the likelihood of economic</text>
  <text start="247.62" dur="4.109">collapse it&amp;#39;s for various countries of</text>
  <text start="249.72" dur="5.04">the world because I started having these</text>
  <text start="251.729" dur="3.51">dreams a few years ago about economic</text>
  <text start="254.76" dur="3.629">collapse</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="6.271">Denise was like okay if we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="258.389" dur="4.921">have something serious happen I think I</text>
  <text start="261.51" dur="3.21">can get through it okay with the right</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="4.05">attitude as long as I know what to</text>
  <text start="264.72" dur="4.71">expect so I went on kind of a self-study</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="4.89">thing I started you know searching</text>
  <text start="269.43" dur="4.35">Wikipedia investopedia and some of the</text>
  <text start="272.25" dur="3.69">business journals Wall Street Journal</text>
  <text start="273.78" dur="3.78">and different places just gathering a</text>
  <text start="275.94" dur="4.409">lot of information doing some</text>
  <text start="277.56" dur="6.419">fact-finding about what causes economic</text>
  <text start="280.349" dur="4.441">collapse what factors have done caused</text>
  <text start="283.979" dur="3.361">it his story</text>
  <text start="284.79" dur="4.23">ugly and then looking at you know the</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="3.96">likelihood of those things happening</text>
  <text start="289.02" dur="5.1">again in the future so I wrote this</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="4.56">paper I actually posted on Facebook as a</text>
  <text start="294.12" dur="3.84">note a couple of years ago I think maybe</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="3.81">I remember reading it yeah yeah it was</text>
  <text start="297.96" dur="3.78">called a no hype look at economic</text>
  <text start="299.67" dur="4.2">collapse is that the same thing that</text>
  <text start="301.74" dur="3.96">comes to mind when I when I think of</text>
  <text start="303.87" dur="5.4">this that you basically explained like</text>
  <text start="305.7" dur="5.67">cycles yet an economic collapse of like</text>
  <text start="309.27" dur="4.56">say the dollar doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s the end</text>
  <text start="311.37" dur="4.83">of the world right exactly that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="313.83" dur="6.18">yeah there&amp;#39;s a relevant so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="316.2" dur="5.61">of cases in in the last century of a lot</text>
  <text start="320.01" dur="3.15">of countries suffering economic collapse</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="3.6">and it wasn&amp;#39;t the end of the world for</text>
  <text start="323.16" dur="4.2">anybody you know life goes on you reap</text>
  <text start="325.41" dur="3.72">egg your your currency you get your</text>
  <text start="327.36" dur="5.19">economy going and you know life goes on</text>
  <text start="329.13" dur="5.61">I kind of wrote the note and ran it by</text>
  <text start="332.55" dur="3.81">some of my friends who are in the</text>
  <text start="334.74" dur="3.06">finance and banking industry and they</text>
  <text start="336.36" dur="4.14">all said if the facts were actually</text>
  <text start="337.8" dur="5.13">really well presented and then of a</text>
  <text start="340.5" dur="4.02">couple of weeks ago when I was sitting</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="3.87">around at home thinking about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="4.8">going on in Greece and with the European</text>
  <text start="346.8" dur="3.36">Union and they&amp;#39;re trying to decide what</text>
  <text start="349.32" dur="3.42">they&amp;#39;re going to do with Greece and</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="4.68">their sovereign debt crisis I felt like</text>
  <text start="352.74" dur="5.25">the Holy Spirit said you know if you</text>
  <text start="354.84" dur="4.95">wanted to publish this paper this would</text>
  <text start="357.99" dur="4.5">be a good time this would be a good time</text>
  <text start="359.79" dur="5.52">to do it so what I did was I took a</text>
  <text start="362.49" dur="5.91">bunch of my dreams from the last five</text>
  <text start="365.31" dur="5.01">years that speak about some very</text>
  <text start="368.4" dur="4.65">specific things that I believe are going</text>
  <text start="370.32" dur="5.7">to happen after some changes in the</text>
  <text start="373.05" dur="8.76">economic systems of the world and I</text>
  <text start="376.02" dur="9.3">wrote a little rant kind of a long blog</text>
  <text start="381.81" dur="5.94">post about my belief that if we were in</text>
  <text start="385.32" dur="3.72">fact to see something like an economic</text>
  <text start="387.75" dur="3.87">collapse or some any kind of global</text>
  <text start="389.04" dur="5.43">catastrophe that it wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="391.62" dur="5.43">be a world ending event it might not</text>
  <text start="394.47" dur="5.79">coincide with the rapture there may be a</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="6.24">whole lot of us left afterwards and if</text>
  <text start="400.26" dur="6.87">the church&amp;#39;s leadership is not preparing</text>
  <text start="403.29" dur="5.7">us for such an event how are we going to</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="3.93">rebuild in the aftermath of something</text>
  <text start="408.99" dur="3.54">like that I mean if the church</text>
  <text start="411.06" dur="3.15">leadership is really kind of setting</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="2.85">this up for Jesus is going to come and</text>
  <text start="414.21" dur="3.09">take us all away so we don&amp;#39;t need to</text>
  <text start="415.38" dur="3.27">worry about it then</text>
  <text start="417.3" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re at a huge</text>
  <text start="418.65" dur="4.079">each disadvantage strategically if we</text>
  <text start="420.93" dur="3.87">are not anticipating something like this</text>
  <text start="422.729" dur="4.291">happening and in a number of the dreams</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.41">that have had the Lord actually showed</text>
  <text start="427.02" dur="4.29">me things what would life would be like</text>
  <text start="429.21" dur="5.37">after the collapse and how things would</text>
  <text start="431.31" dur="5.19">be rebuilt and so that&amp;#39;s what this book</text>
  <text start="434.58" dur="3.6">is about I just threw it together in the</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="4.41">last couple of weeks some of the</text>
  <text start="438.18" dur="5.22">prophetic revelation a blog post length</text>
  <text start="440.91" dur="3.99">discussion on the idea that maybe we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="3.87">not going to be removed before this</text>
  <text start="444.9" dur="4.62">happens and what life might be like in</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="3.78">the aftermath that&amp;#39;s going to be a book</text>
  <text start="449.52" dur="3.45">that I&amp;#39;ll be putting out hopefully in</text>
  <text start="451.05" dur="4.739">the next week or two well don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="452.97" dur="5.19">think that not just with regard to</text>
  <text start="455.789" dur="4.141">finances but there&amp;#39;s all sorts of other</text>
  <text start="458.16" dur="4.65">ways that if we&amp;#39;re not if we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="6.48">ready that we&amp;#39;re at a huge disadvantage</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="6.27">oh yeah anything bad that happens in the</text>
  <text start="466.41" dur="4.229">culture if you know I checked my</text>
  <text start="469.08" dur="4.53">newsfeed I see people posting it as</text>
  <text start="470.639" dur="4.65">evidence Jesus return isn&amp;#39;t here and you</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="5.04">know not just what the economic collapse</text>
  <text start="475.289" dur="6.271">or things like that but it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="478.65" dur="5.1">and I&amp;#39;m not trying to kind of pretend I</text>
  <text start="481.56" dur="4.77">understand economics that&amp;#39;s what you do</text>
  <text start="483.75" dur="4.32">right but it&amp;#39;s almost as if if people</text>
  <text start="486.33" dur="4.23">are talking about it it is a negative</text>
  <text start="488.07" dur="4.409">doom and gloom type of thing and what I</text>
  <text start="490.56" dur="4.32">remember your article right because you</text>
  <text start="492.479" dur="5.131">said it&amp;#39;s a couple years old oh yeah I</text>
  <text start="494.88" dur="5.099">read it like these things happen there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="4.38">cycles throughout the course of decades</text>
  <text start="499.979" dur="4.081">and centuries you know when it comes to</text>
  <text start="501.99" dur="5.52">currencies and things and we might just</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="6.27">be near the end of this currencies cycle</text>
  <text start="507.51" dur="5.88">you know right so and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="510.33" dur="4.8">these things are cyclical they&amp;#39;re fairly</text>
  <text start="513.39" dur="4.709">predictable actually you know if you</text>
  <text start="515.13" dur="5.399">look historically at the models economic</text>
  <text start="518.099" dur="5.94">cycles are very predictable and with</text>
  <text start="520.529" dur="5.43">pretty good reliability if a nation does</text>
  <text start="524.039" dur="4.081">two or three things all at the same time</text>
  <text start="525.959" dur="4.051">you can almost guarantee they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="528.12" dur="4.38">to have a currency collapse and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="530.01" dur="4.59">very simple if like if you look at the</text>
  <text start="532.5" dur="4.529">Weimar Republic of Germany and if you</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="5.16">look at Zimbabwe you know recent</text>
  <text start="537.029" dur="5.281">examples like that usually it&amp;#39;s war or</text>
  <text start="539.76" dur="6.269">revolution that causes those things to</text>
  <text start="542.31" dur="6.66">happen and if you get stuck having to</text>
  <text start="546.029" dur="4.8">pay a lot of reparations after a war and</text>
  <text start="548.97" dur="3.36">your economic infrastructure has been</text>
  <text start="550.829" dur="3.331">devastated during the war</text>
  <text start="552.33" dur="4.62">number one you don&amp;#39;t have any economic</text>
  <text start="554.16" dur="4.8">productivity and number two you have</text>
  <text start="556.95" dur="4.68">huge debts you have to pay to other</text>
  <text start="558.96" dur="5.34">nations and no way to make that money so</text>
  <text start="561.63" dur="5.46">they start printing money to try to pay</text>
  <text start="564.3" dur="4.44">back their debt and money printing and a</text>
  <text start="567.09" dur="4.32">collapsed economy are two things that</text>
  <text start="568.74" dur="5.13">cause really really bad currency</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="5.58">collapse and economic disaster those</text>
  <text start="573.87" dur="5.37">things are the typical examples of</text>
  <text start="576.99" dur="3.51">predictors of currency collapse but</text>
  <text start="579.24" dur="4.74">there are other things that cause it to</text>
  <text start="580.5" dur="5.64">so yeah so the paper looks at the</text>
  <text start="583.98" dur="4.47">factors that typically cause economic</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="4.35">collapse and I can look at some of the</text>
  <text start="588.45" dur="4.53">nations of the world where those things</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="5.73">are actively happening right now where</text>
  <text start="592.98" dur="6.32">nations are printing money and where</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="5.1">they are having economic slowdown and</text>
  <text start="599.3" dur="3.64">identify some nations that are probably</text>
  <text start="601.32" dur="3.63">at risk for that happening again it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="602.94" dur="4.98">be interesting to see how people respond</text>
  <text start="604.95" dur="4.38">to this book because it wasn&amp;#39;t done by</text>
  <text start="607.92" dur="4.2">radar three weeks ago</text>
  <text start="609.33" dur="4.89">well is it long like your other books</text>
  <text start="612.12" dur="4.71">have been so far like 200-page mary</text>
  <text start="614.22" dur="4.8">short no gotcha this is going to be very</text>
  <text start="616.83" dur="4.8">short well so you don&amp;#39;t write 50,000</text>
  <text start="619.02" dur="4.89">word books in two weeks three weeks no</text>
  <text start="621.63" dur="4.19">you&amp;#39;re saying no I don&amp;#39;t the entire</text>
  <text start="623.91" dur="5.3">length of the message right now is</text>
  <text start="625.82" dur="8.5">18,000 words which is fairly short book</text>
  <text start="629.21" dur="7.63">probably it&amp;#39;s evenly two hours tops if</text>
  <text start="634.32" dur="5.7">you&amp;#39;re a slow reader I think right um</text>
  <text start="636.84" dur="5.19">well really it&amp;#39;s only on tops yeah tops</text>

  <text start="643.71" dur="4.41">couple bathroom breaks yeah well the</text>
  <text start="645.75" dur="4.47">thing is though it is really a book</text>
  <text start="648.12" dur="3.72">about economics and finance and that the</text>
  <text start="650.22" dur="3.99">thing that might scare some people away</text>
  <text start="651.84" dur="5.19">the thing that I really try to do though</text>
  <text start="654.21" dur="5.37">with all my books is I dumbed down a lot</text>
  <text start="657.03" dur="3.96">of this information to a level where the</text>
  <text start="659.58" dur="3.12">average person who doesn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="660.99" dur="3">background in finance and economics can</text>
  <text start="662.7" dur="3.78">understand what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="663.99" dur="4.65">X Y Z even ATZ it&amp;#39;s kind of a pattern</text>
  <text start="666.48" dur="4.98">your book titles follow yeah exactly</text>
  <text start="668.64" dur="5.67">I sent the manuscript to Northwest</text>
  <text start="671.46" dur="5.19">prophetic Al Mac as some people know him</text>
  <text start="674.31" dur="4.44">and he said you know this this first</text>
  <text start="676.65" dur="4.5">section could be called global economics</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="5.16">made simple that&amp;#39;s really that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="681.15" dur="4.98">a simple yeah yeah easy simple yeah so</text>
  <text start="683.91" dur="5.13">that&amp;#39;s one of the books I</text>
  <text start="686.13" dur="4.17">going on and then the second book I had</text>
  <text start="689.04" dur="3.39">been going back and forth with this</text>
  <text start="690.3" dur="4.38">manuscript for a while if my wife it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="692.43" dur="5.28">my craziest adventures with God volume 2</text>
  <text start="694.68" dur="5.58">so it&amp;#39;s the next two years of crazy</text>
  <text start="697.71" dur="3.66">stories of miracles financial miracles</text>

  <text start="701.37" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;ve seen got that manuscript finished</text>
  <text start="703.47" dur="5.76">last night sent it off to Lydia my</text>
  <text start="705.81" dur="6.12">editor this morning so I&amp;#39;m hoping we can</text>
  <text start="709.23" dur="5.52">have that book finished in about a month</text>
  <text start="711.93" dur="5.01">and get a cover design for it and we can</text>
  <text start="714.75" dur="5.87">have it to have it available maybe in</text>
  <text start="716.94" dur="7.95">July great well I want to ask you I</text>
  <text start="720.62" dur="6.19">don&amp;#39;t fit yeah so um if you if you wrote</text>
  <text start="724.89" dur="5.25">a fiction book would it come easy to you</text>
  <text start="726.81" dur="5.76">or is it just like an idea well that is</text>
  <text start="730.14" dur="5.37">a really good question and I had never</text>
  <text start="732.57" dur="6.63">thought about writing a fictional work</text>
  <text start="735.51" dur="6.15">until let&amp;#39;s see this is 2015 it was</text>
  <text start="739.2" dur="4.65">probably late 2013 when I started</text>
  <text start="741.66" dur="4.68">writing the bogan stories on Facebook</text>
  <text start="743.85" dur="3.96">okay now did you get in on any of that</text>
  <text start="746.34" dur="3.21">or not it doesn&amp;#39;t ring a bell</text>
  <text start="747.81" dur="4.35">doesn&amp;#39;t ring up to me right now right</text>
  <text start="749.55" dur="6.33">yeah so gosh this is such a strange</text>
  <text start="752.16" dur="7.02">story so Steve Harmon was on Facebook</text>
  <text start="755.88" dur="7.29">and he was teaching people about some</text>
  <text start="759.18" dur="7.68">fairly graduate level concepts involved</text>
  <text start="763.17" dur="4.86">in healing and deliverance and a lot of</text>
  <text start="766.86" dur="5.13">people were scratching their heads going</text>
  <text start="768.03" dur="6.42">what is this crazy man talking about so</text>
  <text start="771.99" dur="5.6">I thought you know what we need to do is</text>
  <text start="774.45" dur="5.79">we need someone to write an allegory</text>
  <text start="777.59" dur="4.69">basically a fictional story to</text>
  <text start="780.24" dur="5.16">illustrate the principles that Steve is</text>
  <text start="782.28" dur="6.09">talking about because when it comes to</text>
  <text start="785.4" dur="4.44">some of this outside the box process of</text>
  <text start="788.37" dur="3.51">inner healing emotional healing and</text>
  <text start="789.84" dur="3.57">stuff you have all these people who are</text>
  <text start="791.88" dur="2.82">like show me that in the Bible that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="793.41" dur="3.24">not in the Bible that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="794.7" dur="2.28">biblical that&amp;#39;s not God would never do</text>
  <text start="796.65" dur="2.58">that</text>
  <text start="796.98" dur="4.89">what I found is it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to</text>
  <text start="799.23" dur="5.49">train and equip and teach people who</text>
  <text start="801.87" dur="6.24">have these mental roadblocks if you</text>
  <text start="804.72" dur="7.29">teach them through parables and eligor</text>
  <text start="808.11" dur="5.91">II so I wrote four stories based around</text>
  <text start="812.01" dur="4.2">a woman who is depressed and suicidal</text>
  <text start="814.02" dur="4.29">she ends up committing suicide and then</text>
  <text start="816.21" dur="3.7">she goes into the heavens and she meets</text>
  <text start="818.31" dur="3.88">Jesus meets the five</text>
  <text start="819.91" dur="5.04">there she meets her personal angel his</text>
  <text start="822.19" dur="4.53">name is Gloria and they start to</text>
  <text start="824.95" dur="3.84">introduce her to the kingdom and how it</text>
  <text start="826.72" dur="4.41">works how power works how authority</text>
  <text start="828.79" dur="5.58">works and how demons work she gets us</text>
  <text start="831.13" dur="6.15">behind the scenes tutorial on the</text>
  <text start="834.37" dur="4.38">spiritual world well I wrote about four</text>
  <text start="837.28" dur="3.63">or five of these short installments</text>
  <text start="838.75" dur="3.45">there were probably five to six hundred</text>
  <text start="840.91" dur="3">words I think the longest one was</text>
  <text start="842.2" dur="4.17">probably a thousand words and I posted</text>
  <text start="843.91" dur="5.31">him on Facebook as notes and the</text>
  <text start="846.37" dur="4.89">response to them was huge everyone</text>
  <text start="849.22" dur="4.47">wanted to read say he got to write</text>
  <text start="851.26" dur="4.65">another story keep this going and after</text>
  <text start="853.69" dur="3.54">writing about five or six of them I was</text>
  <text start="855.91" dur="2.79">kind of telling people look I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="857.23" dur="4.05">planning on turning this into a novel</text>
  <text start="858.7" dur="4.71">this is just a series of short stories</text>
  <text start="861.28" dur="5.4">to illustrate some spiritual principles</text>
  <text start="863.41" dur="5.94">and the more I wrote the more people</text>
  <text start="866.68" dur="4.08">wanted me to keep writing and then there</text>
  <text start="869.35" dur="3.24">was this pressure it&amp;#39;s for me to write a</text>
  <text start="870.76" dur="4.95">novel and and I had not thought about</text>
  <text start="872.59" dur="6.06">doing that but the problem was I found</text>
  <text start="875.71" dur="4.83">writing fiction really easy it was very</text>
  <text start="878.65" dur="6.12">simple for me to do it I would basically</text>
  <text start="880.54" dur="7.86">sit down at the computer and I would see</text>
  <text start="884.77" dur="6.12">in my imagination these scenes being</text>
  <text start="888.4" dur="4.23">played out in my mind and I could in my</text>
  <text start="890.89" dur="3.99">mind I could hear this internal dialogue</text>
  <text start="892.63" dur="3.81">between the characters so I just started</text>
  <text start="894.88" dur="5.4">dictating what I was seeing and hearing</text>
  <text start="896.44" dur="6.27">I believe that a lot of my process of</text>
  <text start="900.28" dur="3.63">writing is I&amp;#39;m basically dictating</text>
  <text start="902.71" dur="3.6">whatever the Holy Spirit is showing me</text>
  <text start="903.91" dur="4.59">so when I sit down to write a book like</text>
  <text start="906.31" dur="4.68">seeing in the spirit was the same thing</text>
  <text start="908.5" dur="5.16">I took a vacation from work for about</text>
  <text start="910.99" dur="5.58">ten days and five of the days I sat down</text>
  <text start="913.66" dur="5.31">at my computer at sunrise with my cup of</text>
  <text start="916.57" dur="5.4">coffee and I just started hammering away</text>
  <text start="918.97" dur="5.13">on the computer writing four to five</text>
  <text start="921.97" dur="3.87">thousand words a day day after day after</text>
  <text start="924.1" dur="4.32">day from sunup till sundown that&amp;#39;s all I</text>
  <text start="925.84" dur="4.65">did was write for five days I got into</text>
  <text start="928.42" dur="4.83">this flow where I could just sense what</text>
  <text start="930.49" dur="4.44">the Holy Spirit was revealing and I was</text>
  <text start="933.25" dur="4.8">recalling some dreams and recalling some</text>
  <text start="934.93" dur="5.7">experiences and I would just dictate and</text>
  <text start="938.05" dur="5.43">write and get in this flow and before</text>
  <text start="940.63" dur="5.61">long I had 20,000 words written so that</text>
  <text start="943.48" dur="5.49">is part of my writing process and the</text>
  <text start="946.24" dur="5.01">fiction work is interesting because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="948.97" dur="4.53">torn between you know a lot of fiction</text>
  <text start="951.25" dur="4.53">writers will write out a plot</text>
  <text start="953.5" dur="4.2">right out they&amp;#39;ll develop the characters</text>
  <text start="955.78" dur="3.24">and they&amp;#39;ll develop storyline and</text>
  <text start="957.7" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;ll develop subplots and they have</text>
  <text start="959.02" dur="3.6">it all graphed out ahead of time I am</text>
  <text start="960.91" dur="3.71">going to write a fictional book I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="962.62" dur="4.65">going to try to write a trilogy actually</text>
  <text start="964.62" dur="4.75">but I don&amp;#39;t know that I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="967.27" dur="5.43">develop the plotline ahead of time I</text>
  <text start="969.37" dur="5.58">really like the process of dictating</text>
  <text start="972.7" dur="4.47">what the Holy Spirit is showing me and</text>
  <text start="974.95" dur="5.31">letting him be in control of the action</text>
  <text start="977.17" dur="4.59">I mean it&amp;#39;s a step of faith right it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="980.26" dur="3.72">been working really well so far</text>
  <text start="981.76" dur="3.36">everything you just said except for the</text>
  <text start="983.98" dur="4.98">part about the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="985.12" dur="6.72">that&amp;#39;s how Stephen King says he writes</text>
  <text start="988.96" dur="5.28">in his in his novel that book I reviewed</text>
  <text start="991.84" dur="4.5">and you commented on he refers to it</text>
  <text start="994.24" dur="4.44">like like a the way an archaeologist</text>
  <text start="996.34" dur="4.41">finds like you know this piece of bone</text>
  <text start="998.68" dur="4.23">sticking out of the ground and that for</text>
  <text start="1000.75" dur="4.98">him writing is like okay here&amp;#39;s the bone</text>
  <text start="1002.91" dur="5.34">and now we&amp;#39;ll well you know get some</text>
  <text start="1005.73" dur="4.95">some dust off of it and dig around it</text>
  <text start="1008.25" dur="5.46">and see what it is and and pull it out</text>
  <text start="1010.68" dur="7.02">of the ground or whatever and that he</text>
  <text start="1013.71" dur="6.27">begins writing that way he doesn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="1017.7" dur="5.55">never has a plot figured out in his mind</text>
  <text start="1019.98" dur="4.8">and that he just basically comes up with</text>
  <text start="1023.25" dur="4.29">like he says he comes up with a</text>
  <text start="1024.78" dur="4.38">situation or some characters or what</text>
  <text start="1027.54" dur="3.95">would happen if you put a bunch of</text>
  <text start="1029.16" dur="4.65">characters in this circumstance like</text>
  <text start="1031.49" dur="4.3">under the dome or something you know</text>
  <text start="1033.81" dur="4.41">that TV show that&amp;#39;s out now that he</text>
  <text start="1035.79" dur="3.81">begins with with that and then he just</text>
  <text start="1038.22" dur="4.26">sits down and writes it sees where it</text>
  <text start="1039.6" dur="5.88">takes him when I read that I thought</text>
  <text start="1042.48" dur="5.88">well then if that&amp;#39;s how he does it then</text>
  <text start="1045.48" dur="5.04">if I were to sit down and try it I might</text>
  <text start="1048.36" dur="4.65">do that I might go that route for me</text>
  <text start="1050.52" dur="3.84">fiction writing is hard it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1053.01" dur="2.88">something that comes natural to me so I</text>
  <text start="1054.36" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t necessarily see myself</text>
  <text start="1055.89" dur="7.23">doing much of it but when I when I read</text>
  <text start="1059.43" dur="4.98">that from an expert I thought to myself</text>
  <text start="1063.12" dur="3.93">you know if I were under the anointing</text>
  <text start="1064.41" dur="4.26">and the Lord were giving me something to</text>
  <text start="1067.05" dur="3.78">write about some kind of fiction story</text>
  <text start="1068.67" dur="2.94">or something then oh my goodness I would</text>
  <text start="1070.83" dur="2.82">totally do that</text>
  <text start="1071.61" dur="4.62">I don&amp;#39;t think I would have a plot</text>
  <text start="1073.65" dur="4.83">outline that I&amp;#39;m trying to fill in the</text>
  <text start="1076.23" dur="4.86">spaces I did come to the table with an</text>
  <text start="1078.48" dur="5.34">agenda I had some spiritual principles</text>
  <text start="1081.09" dur="6.81">that I wanted to illustrate I wanted to</text>
  <text start="1083.82" dur="6.81">give people a better look at how demons</text>
  <text start="1087.9" dur="5.76">manipulate people and how they influence</text>
  <text start="1090.63" dur="4.89">people and how they speak to people in</text>
  <text start="1093.66" dur="3.63">the spiritual world and how they whisper</text>
  <text start="1095.52" dur="3.84">in your ear about killing yourself and</text>
  <text start="1097.29" dur="4.32">things of that nature so that was my</text>
  <text start="1099.36" dur="5.13">agenda I wanted to illustrate and</text>
  <text start="1101.61" dur="4.53">portray some very specific things but</text>
  <text start="1104.49" dur="3.69">how that was going to play out with the</text>
  <text start="1106.14" dur="4.95">characters I had no idea when I started</text>
  <text start="1108.18" dur="5.129">and some of the things that I got I was</text>
  <text start="1111.09" dur="3.81">literally minute by minute the Holy</text>
  <text start="1113.309" dur="3.331">Spirit was giving me revelation about</text>
  <text start="1114.9" dur="3.38">how things work that I had no</text>
  <text start="1116.64" dur="6.51">understanding of five minutes earlier</text>
  <text start="1118.28" dur="7.6">how did you write your first book the</text>
  <text start="1123.15" dur="5.49">long story made short is okay it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1125.88" dur="4.11">the first book I published was a Kindle</text>
  <text start="1128.64" dur="2.669">you know the Kindle book at first the</text>
  <text start="1129.99" dur="4.35">first one I published was six lies</text>
  <text start="1131.309" dur="5.461">people believe about divine healing that</text>
  <text start="1134.34" dur="4.32">was really repurposing a lot of old blog</text>
  <text start="1136.77" dur="4.92">content that was about healing and</text>
  <text start="1138.66" dur="8.46">piecing things together into a book back</text>
  <text start="1141.69" dur="8.13">in 2010 I remember when Mike dr. Michael</text>
  <text start="1147.12" dur="4.74">Brown was down here in Peru and at a</text>
  <text start="1149.82" dur="4.32">dinner table conversation I got to ask</text>
  <text start="1151.86" dur="5.94">him how did you know you were ready to</text>
  <text start="1154.14" dur="6.419">write your first book and he was 33</text>
  <text start="1157.8" dur="6.12">which now I am when he published his</text>
  <text start="1160.559" dur="4.711">first book and as a blogger I realized</text>
  <text start="1163.92" dur="4.08">like I&amp;#39;m getting to a point where I</text>
  <text start="1165.27" dur="4.35">could write books but I&amp;#39;m not sure if I</text>
  <text start="1168" dur="4.77">should yet you know I&amp;#39;ve heard people</text>
  <text start="1169.62" dur="4.68">say don&amp;#39;t write until you&amp;#39;re 40 or</text>
  <text start="1172.77" dur="3.75">things like that was right by all it</text>
  <text start="1174.3" dur="6.48">wasn&amp;#39;t it yep who wrote books before he</text>
  <text start="1176.52" dur="5.88">was 30 incidentally enough but anyway no</text>
  <text start="1180.78" dur="2.79">but there was this balance between like</text>
  <text start="1182.4" dur="4.65">you know I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to hear like a</text>

  <text start="1219.41" dur="4.73">but</text>
  <text start="1221.35" dur="6.42">I had enough wherewithal to know that is</text>

  <text start="1231.309" dur="4.61">like get some experience learn from it</text>
  <text start="1233.47" dur="5.339">by doing a healing book first so I</text>
  <text start="1235.919" dur="5.081">really just repurposed a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1238.809" dur="4.831">content I originally was blogging about</text>
  <text start="1241" dur="4.65">in the early 2000s and then updating the</text>
  <text start="1243.64" dur="4.35">book and maybe modifying some things I</text>
  <text start="1245.65" dur="4.86">would say differently now it was kind of</text>
  <text start="1247.99" dur="4.98">longer and and had more of the faith</text>
  <text start="1250.51" dur="5.399">stuff in it and then in the end I</text>
  <text start="1252.97" dur="4.68">decided well Kindle books there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1255.909" dur="3.661">like a minimum length they need to be</text>
  <text start="1257.65" dur="5.279">because I felt like the two things</text>
  <text start="1259.57" dur="6.39">flowed together but it wasn&amp;#39;t making a</text>
  <text start="1262.929" dur="5.25">very good book like it I felt better off</text>
  <text start="1265.96" dur="4.07">splitting them into and so I went with</text>
  <text start="1268.179" dur="5.161">like a short hundred some-odd page</text>
  <text start="1270.03" dur="4.96">healing book and then about a month or</text>
  <text start="1273.34" dur="3.3">two later put out the faith book and</text>
  <text start="1274.99" dur="4.319">they&amp;#39;re meant to kind of complement each</text>
  <text start="1276.64" dur="5.279">other because at first they were kind of</text>
  <text start="1279.309" dur="4.561">like one manuscript and I felt like they</text>
  <text start="1281.919" dur="3.301">didn&amp;#39;t fit together very well as one</text>
  <text start="1283.87" dur="2.85">book but they complement each other</text>
  <text start="1285.22" dur="2.13">better as separate that&amp;#39;s how that came</text>
  <text start="1286.72" dur="2.88">about</text>
  <text start="1287.35" dur="4.65">and this is gonna be an interesting</text>
  <text start="1289.6" dur="5.79">discussion for people who want to write</text>
  <text start="1292" dur="6.6">books okay so if you are a person who is</text>
  <text start="1295.39" dur="6.029">a aspiring author you definitely need to</text>
  <text start="1298.6" dur="5.52">listen up here I did the same thing when</text>
  <text start="1301.419" dur="5.37">I wrote my first book I had written 20</text>
  <text start="1304.12" dur="4.32">or 30 blog posts on healing and people</text>
  <text start="1306.789" dur="4.651">started bugging me hey you need to write</text>
  <text start="1308.44" dur="5.67">a book I was like that I want to write a</text>
  <text start="1311.44" dur="4.89">book it&amp;#39;s too much work and after I had</text>
  <text start="1314.11" dur="4.83">enough blog posts out there where I had</text>
  <text start="1316.33" dur="4.89">fleshed out enough the ideas and had</text>
  <text start="1318.94" dur="4.38">received a lot of input and I was</text>
  <text start="1321.22" dur="4.02">getting into a place where I had a</text>
  <text start="1323.32" dur="4.62">pretty comprehensive knowledge of the</text>
  <text start="1325.24" dur="4.77">aspects of healing it was at that point</text>
  <text start="1327.94" dur="4.32">where I think I developed some</text>
  <text start="1330.01" dur="4.919">credibility with an audience there were</text>
  <text start="1332.26" dur="4.68">you know hundreds or maybe thousands of</text>
  <text start="1334.929" dur="3.391">people who had heard about me they knew</text>

  <text start="1340.99" dur="5.58">out there in the internet that Google</text>
  <text start="1343.9" dur="4.95">was nice enough to aggregate and</text>
  <text start="1346.57" dur="4.08">categorize so when people started</text>
  <text start="1348.85" dur="4.14">looking for articles on healing or</text>
  <text start="1350.65" dur="4.649">miracles or resurrections a lot of them</text>

  <text start="1387.639" dur="5.28">the process of writing a book and I</text>
  <text start="1390.57" dur="4.51">recommend to them the process that I</text>
  <text start="1392.919" dur="5.1">found accidentally so you talk about</text>
  <text start="1395.08" dur="5.099">repurposing blog posts and I did the</text>
  <text start="1398.019" dur="3.72">same thing but I didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1400.179" dur="4.291">understand the process I was going</text>
  <text start="1401.739" dur="5.19">through now looking back on it years</text>
  <text start="1404.47" dur="3.899">later I can real I see that a lot of</text>
  <text start="1406.929" dur="3.81">very successful authors have done the</text>
  <text start="1408.369" dur="6.63">very same thing I think David Kiyosaki</text>
  <text start="1410.739" dur="5.971">does that they put out content on the</text>
  <text start="1414.999" dur="3.451">internet on their personal websites or</text>
  <text start="1416.71" dur="3.899">blogs the ax search engines pick it up</text>
  <text start="1418.45" dur="4.709">they aggregate it they start bringing an</text>
  <text start="1420.609" dur="4.92">audience to your website based on the</text>
  <text start="1423.159" dur="3.571">content you&amp;#39;re sharing and then after</text>
  <text start="1425.529" dur="3.301">you&amp;#39;ve been doing that for a few years</text>
  <text start="1426.73" dur="5.1">you should just take all that content</text>
  <text start="1428.83" dur="4.319">and repackage it as a book because</text>
  <text start="1431.83" dur="4.529">you&amp;#39;ve got an audience that wants to</text>
  <text start="1433.149" dur="5.22">read it you have the content already</text>
  <text start="1436.359" dur="3.601">more or less flushed out for the most</text>
  <text start="1438.369" dur="4.05">part except for some basic editing and</text>
  <text start="1439.96" dur="4.529">then you just turn it into an e-book or</text>
  <text start="1442.419" dur="4.44">a print book if you want to both write</text>
  <text start="1444.489" dur="4.951">well I&amp;#39;m doing a mix of that like the</text>
  <text start="1446.859" dur="5.16">healing book was a lot of repurposing</text>
  <text start="1449.44" dur="4.559">but you know one thing that slipped my</text>
  <text start="1452.019" dur="5.671">mind as I listen to you share about</text>
  <text start="1453.999" dur="6.03">yours is I decided not to make some big</text>
  <text start="1457.69" dur="4.199">huge comprehensive book because I wanted</text>
  <text start="1460.029" dur="2.97">to write other ones you know what I mean</text>
  <text start="1461.889" dur="3.72">so I didn&amp;#39;t want to get like sick</text>
  <text start="1462.999" dur="4.231">writing that yeah and when you think of</text>
  <text start="1465.609" dur="4.41">healing there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no shortage of</text>
  <text start="1467.23" dur="4.409">books right now there are somatic so I</text>
  <text start="1470.019" dur="5.49">was like well what am I going to do that</text>
  <text start="1471.639" dur="5.76">makes mine stand out but yet you listen</text>
  <text start="1475.509" dur="4.441">to the title or you look at the cover</text>
  <text start="1477.399" dur="3.96">page and not only do you know how it</text>
  <text start="1479.95" dur="3.27">stands up but you know what you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1481.359" dur="4.381">to get out of it so that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1483.22" dur="6">why I went with specifically like the</text>
  <text start="1485.74" dur="5.13">deconstructionism angle of like you know</text>
  <text start="1489.22" dur="5.1">I grew up in a in a Plymouth Brethren</text>
  <text start="1490.87" dur="5.64">Church and my mom was was healed at the</text>
  <text start="1494.32" dur="4.8">the crazy charismatic church outside</text>
  <text start="1496.51" dur="5.58">town that you don&amp;#39;t admit you&amp;#39;ve gone to</text>
  <text start="1499.12" dur="5.1">let alone that you got healed at you</text>
  <text start="1502.09" dur="4.38">know what I mean and so and so I&amp;#39;d hear</text>
  <text start="1504.22" dur="4.68">these things over the years like you</text>
  <text start="1506.47" dur="5.22">know many times and and so I try to hone</text>
  <text start="1508.9" dur="4.59">in on the chapters being like lies</text>
  <text start="1511.69" dur="3.15">people believe so this is what people</text>
  <text start="1513.49" dur="2.7">believe this is what the truth is you</text>
  <text start="1514.84" dur="4.469">know like Jesus and his parable saying</text>
  <text start="1516.19" dur="5.369">you&amp;#39;ve heard it said but I tell you you</text>
  <text start="1519.309" dur="4.74">know in size going for that style of</text>
  <text start="1521.559" dur="4.891">right telling debug little lies</text>
  <text start="1524.049" dur="4.62">yeah and Mythbusters or something and</text>
  <text start="1526.45" dur="4.2">right the the faith stuff I felt like</text>
  <text start="1528.669" dur="4.521">didn&amp;#39;t work so much that way if I wanted</text>
  <text start="1530.65" dur="5.19">in this same book to deconstruct and</text>
  <text start="1533.19" dur="4.3">encourage people I felt like the faith</text>
  <text start="1535.84" dur="4.469">stuff was just kind of like tacked on</text>
  <text start="1537.49" dur="5.73">and so that&amp;#39;s how it became its separate</text>
  <text start="1540.309" dur="5.551">book and both of those were repurposed</text>
  <text start="1543.22" dur="5.25">blog content and I&amp;#39;ve written some other</text>
  <text start="1545.86" dur="4.86">little you know short kindle bite-size</text>
  <text start="1548.47" dur="4.35">type of books but the speaking in</text>
  <text start="1550.72" dur="4.17">tongues book is where is kind of like</text>
  <text start="1552.82" dur="4.41">really going with this like if I if I</text>
  <text start="1554.89" dur="4.86">could write a book this is what I&amp;#39;d want</text>
  <text start="1557.23" dur="4.439">it to be but I want to test the waters</text>
  <text start="1559.75" dur="4.82">with these other things first like the</text>
  <text start="1561.669" dur="6.211">healing another popular subject matter</text>
  <text start="1564.57" dur="5.89">but with the speaking in tongues book it</text>
  <text start="1567.88" dur="4.2">was a lot more writing stuff but never</text>
  <text start="1570.46" dur="3.92">taken time to sit down and write before</text>
  <text start="1572.08" dur="5.16">so it was maybe like 20 or 30 percent</text>
  <text start="1574.38" dur="5.65">repurposing blog content and then the</text>
  <text start="1577.24" dur="5.58">rest coming up with it afresh and</text>
  <text start="1580.03" dur="4.59">actually tint to kind of answer your</text>
  <text start="1582.82" dur="4.05">question further about how did the first</text>
  <text start="1584.62" dur="4.439">book come up because in some way this is</text>
  <text start="1586.87" dur="4.02">kind of like my first book The Nine</text>
  <text start="1589.059" dur="4.021">Lives people believe about speaking in</text>
  <text start="1590.89" dur="5.159">tongues the same thing what kind of</text>
  <text start="1593.08" dur="5.7">nonsense do I hear people cling to that</text>
  <text start="1596.049" dur="4.141">really holds them back in this area and</text>
  <text start="1598.78" dur="3.33">you know I could keep on following this</text>
  <text start="1600.19" dur="3.78">template for like other books right but</text>
  <text start="1602.11" dur="3.96">when it comes to speaking in tongues</text>
  <text start="1603.97" dur="4.829">there&amp;#39;s oh there&amp;#39;s a lot and then</text>
  <text start="1606.07" dur="5.849">coupled with how I know there&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="1608.799" dur="4.62">lot of very good books out there and</text>
  <text start="1611.919" dur="4.921">then there&amp;#39;s a few that are you know</text>
  <text start="1613.419" dur="7.14">stellar and like you said about Google a</text>
  <text start="1616.84" dur="5.97">couple blog posts of mine that they get</text>
  <text start="1620.559" dur="5.551">the most search engine traffic are</text>
  <text start="1622.81" dur="5.94">speaking in tongues and the search terms</text>
  <text start="1626.11" dur="6.05">are anything from what if I don&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="1628.75" dur="5.49">in tongues we&amp;#39;re in the Bible is</text>
  <text start="1632.16" dur="5.2">speaking in tongues least of the gifts</text>
  <text start="1634.24" dur="6.3">least of the gifts verse you know stuff</text>
  <text start="1637.36" dur="5.61">like that so I knew okay if I tackle</text>
  <text start="1640.54" dur="3.96">speaking in tongues is not the least of</text>
  <text start="1642.97" dur="3.45">the gifts there&amp;#39;s no verse that says</text>
  <text start="1644.5" dur="4.44">that it&amp;#39;s just some kind of weird thing</text>
  <text start="1646.42" dur="4.53">people you know and that blog post gets</text>
  <text start="1648.94" dur="5.1">you know it just drives traffic to my</text>
  <text start="1650.95" dur="5.1">site every day so I knew I&amp;#39;m onto</text>
  <text start="1654.04" dur="4.17">something if I take stuff like this and</text>
  <text start="1656.05" dur="4.74">make it into a book and and in this case</text>
  <text start="1658.21" dur="5.25">it was a lot more fresh content and and</text>
  <text start="1660.79" dur="5.16">one of the complaints you know it&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="1663.46" dur="3.99">a lot of positive opinion and feedback</text>
  <text start="1665.95" dur="2.73">from people about the healing book but</text>
  <text start="1667.45" dur="3.21">the main complaint was like I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1668.68" dur="3.99">have too many testimonies in it and</text>
  <text start="1670.66" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s kind of like reflective of how I</text>
  <text start="1672.67" dur="3.45">block I&amp;#39;m trying to create you of</text>
  <text start="1674.74" dur="3.18">something instead of right kind of go oh</text>
  <text start="1676.12" dur="4.14">yeah yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I like</text>
  <text start="1677.92" dur="5.07">about you know you&amp;#39;re made simple style</text>
  <text start="1680.26" dur="4.98">is it&amp;#39;s like yeah I can go do this and</text>
  <text start="1682.99" dur="4.11">so with the tongues book like I took</text>
  <text start="1685.24" dur="3.39">more time to actually kind of include</text>
  <text start="1687.1" dur="3.09">myself in the narrative or share</text>
  <text start="1688.63" dur="3.63">examples of what I&amp;#39;m talking about or</text>
  <text start="1690.19" dur="5.31">and so it kind of became longer and</text>
  <text start="1692.26" dur="5.82">became like an actual book right though</text>
  <text start="1695.5" dur="4.29">that pool of books is kind of how how</text>
  <text start="1698.08" dur="4.1">they came about they each kind of have a</text>
  <text start="1699.79" dur="3.84">different way they came into existence</text>
  <text start="1702.18" dur="4.66">so well</text>
  <text start="1703.63" dur="5.46">this brings us to another question and</text>
  <text start="1706.84" dur="6.18">it&amp;#39;s really kind of an interesting</text>
  <text start="1709.09" dur="6.3">dynamic because there are some books it</text>
  <text start="1713.02" dur="5.01">seems that you can write the books fill</text>
  <text start="1715.39" dur="4.59">a niche where there&amp;#39;s a demand for some</text>
  <text start="1718.03" dur="6.11">information and content that no one has</text>
  <text start="1719.98" dur="8.01">provided yet so I think your book on</text>
  <text start="1724.14" dur="6.7">speaking in tongues was probably a book</text>
  <text start="1727.99" dur="5.34">that hit that niche that there was where</text>
  <text start="1730.84" dur="4.05">there was a vacuum and it&amp;#39;s one of those</text>
  <text start="1733.33" dur="4.56">subjects where if you write a decent</text>
  <text start="1734.89" dur="4.29">book on that subject gentes are you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1737.89" dur="2.91">going to get a fair amount of traffic</text>
  <text start="1739.18" dur="4.08">because there just aren&amp;#39;t a lot of good</text>
  <text start="1740.8" dur="4.56">books on that subject at least that</text>
  <text start="1743.26" dur="3.39">organizationís type that&amp;#39;s dead aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1745.36" dur="3.09">cessationists type of books and why</text>
  <text start="1746.65" dur="4.05">recitation is writing about tongues I</text>
  <text start="1748.45" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t know I mean what&amp;#39;s the point of</text>
  <text start="1750.7" dur="5.13">even writing about that but yeah you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1752.53" dur="3.96">right and so your book fills a void that</text>
  <text start="1755.83" dur="1.979">we&amp;#39;re P</text>
  <text start="1756.49" dur="3.18">have all these questions and they have</text>
  <text start="1757.809" dur="3.031">they are curious and it&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="1759.67" dur="3.63">things that there&amp;#39;s just a lot of</text>
  <text start="1760.84" dur="4.77">curiosity out there even people who go</text>
  <text start="1763.3" dur="3.84">to cessationist churches they still they</text>
  <text start="1765.61" dur="3.39">have friends who are speaking in tongues</text>
  <text start="1767.14" dur="3.96">and they&amp;#39;re like well is this demonic</text>
  <text start="1769" dur="3.87">like my pastor saying or is this legit I</text>
  <text start="1771.1" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t know I wish somebody would write a</text>
  <text start="1772.87" dur="4.2">book on this so I think your book does a</text>
  <text start="1774.79" dur="3.93">really good job of providing some good</text>
  <text start="1777.07" dur="4.28">solid information for people who are</text>
  <text start="1778.72" dur="5.24">curious and want to know the other</text>
  <text start="1781.35" dur="5.92">aspect of your book writing though is</text>
  <text start="1783.96" dur="6.61">you published a book on healing probably</text>
  <text start="1787.27" dur="5.31">because you knew this is a subject it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1790.57" dur="4.8">of great interest there&amp;#39;s a lot of books</text>
  <text start="1792.58" dur="5.19">out there it&amp;#39;s a hot topic sure right</text>
  <text start="1795.37" dur="4.08">yeah so I published my book I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="1797.77" dur="4.71">in the spirit partly because I knew it</text>
  <text start="1799.45" dur="5.01">was a hot topic not necessarily to fill</text>
  <text start="1802.48" dur="3.51">the void of a niche because there&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1804.46" dur="4.26">a million books written on seeing in the</text>
  <text start="1805.99" dur="4.74">spirit in the last five years but</text>
  <text start="1808.72" dur="4.35">because I saw Michael Van Wyman&amp;#39;s book</text>
  <text start="1810.73" dur="5.699">you know how to see in the spirit was</text>
  <text start="1813.07" dur="5.07">just continually selling really really</text>
  <text start="1816.429" dur="3.961">well whether he had it on sale or was</text>
  <text start="1818.14" dur="4.47">giving it away for free or not that book</text>
  <text start="1820.39" dur="5.1">was a really really strong seller in the</text>
  <text start="1822.61" dur="6.3">charismatic Pentecostal the categories</text>
  <text start="1825.49" dur="6.24">on Kindle because it was a subject of</text>
  <text start="1828.91" dur="5.7">huge interest to a lot of people in this</text>
  <text start="1831.73" dur="4.71">current day and age and I think that if</text>
  <text start="1834.61" dur="3.39">anyone writes a decent book on that</text>
  <text start="1836.44" dur="3.84">subject they&amp;#39;ll probably sell pretty</text>
  <text start="1838" dur="4.29">well with it I know Jeremy mangosteen is</text>
  <text start="1840.28" dur="4.11">looking at writing a book on singing in</text>
  <text start="1842.29" dur="3.96">the spirit and my book has sold really</text>
  <text start="1844.39" dur="4.65">well from the get-go because it&amp;#39;s it is</text>
  <text start="1846.25" dur="5.37">a very very hot topic right and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1849.04" dur="5.1">I don&amp;#39;t know that it is even that</text>
  <text start="1851.62" dur="4.98">popular of a topic I don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="1854.14" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s a lot of books on it but it is</text>
  <text start="1856.6" dur="5.13">like you say a hot topic so it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1859.09" dur="5.16">like in a way it does fill a void that</text>
  <text start="1861.73" dur="4.47">maybe maybe in a few years it won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="1864.25" dur="4.53">like a void anymore because more people</text>
  <text start="1866.2" dur="3.93">are touching that&amp;#39;s subject right yeah</text>
  <text start="1868.78" dur="3.96">and there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a lotta there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1870.13" dur="4.49">continuum so like unhealing there&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1872.74" dur="4.23">a million books out there right on</text>
  <text start="1874.62" dur="5.82">seeing in the spirit there&amp;#39;s probably a</text>
  <text start="1876.97" dur="6.36">couple of dozen on tongues not so many</text>
  <text start="1880.44" dur="4.84">yeah and then the ones there are looks</text>
  <text start="1883.33" dur="3.39">on tongues no I mean yeah there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1885.28" dur="3.21">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of tongues but</text>
  <text start="1886.72" dur="2.85">there&amp;#39;s a lot of anti tongues book</text>
  <text start="1888.49" dur="4.06">exactly</text>
  <text start="1889.57" dur="4.75">books that actually teach you the</text>
  <text start="1892.55" dur="4.26">importance of tongues there&amp;#39;s very few</text>
  <text start="1894.32" dur="4.2">and this and it&amp;#39;s another subject that</text>
  <text start="1896.81" dur="4.05">if somebody wrote a decent book on</text>
  <text start="1898.52" dur="4.14">tongues it would probably sell pretty</text>
  <text start="1900.86" dur="3.69">well simply because there isn&amp;#39;t a whole</text>
  <text start="1902.66" dur="4.59">lot out there that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s good on the</text>
  <text start="1904.55" dur="5.31">subject so one of the things for authors</text>
  <text start="1907.25" dur="4.86">to think about is I get these questions</text>
  <text start="1909.86" dur="4.32">from friends well how do I go about</text>
  <text start="1912.11" dur="4.71">writing a book and it&amp;#39;s probably not a</text>
  <text start="1914.18" dur="6.06">bad idea to analyze the market and look</text>
  <text start="1916.82" dur="6.15">at what is already out there what has</text>
  <text start="1920.24" dur="5.88">been written how has it been received by</text>
  <text start="1922.97" dur="4.86">the public how have the reviews been of</text>
  <text start="1926.12" dur="3.93">the current existing books that are out</text>
  <text start="1927.83" dur="4.98">there one of my next books is going to</text>
  <text start="1930.05" dur="4.32">be on hearing God&amp;#39;s voice the reason why</text>
  <text start="1932.81" dur="4.26">I want to publish that book is because</text>
  <text start="1934.37" dur="3.93">there are very very few books on hearing</text>
  <text start="1937.07" dur="3.09">God&amp;#39;s voice out there</text>
  <text start="1938.3" dur="4.08">mark burglar has one and it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1940.16" dur="4.65">pretty well reviewed but other than that</text>
  <text start="1942.38" dur="5.43">there aren&amp;#39;t very many books out there</text>
  <text start="1944.81" dur="4.71">on out of your God&amp;#39;s voice it&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1947.81" dur="4.35">subject where I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1949.52" dur="4.44">interest but there is a vacuum there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1952.16" dur="3.18">this void where there haven&amp;#39;t been a lot</text>
  <text start="1953.96" dur="2.37">of good books written on the subject</text>
  <text start="1955.34" dur="3">yeah I agree</text>
  <text start="1956.33" dur="5.84">and and to touch on that thing you said</text>
  <text start="1958.34" dur="6.96">about like looking at the market I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1962.17" dur="5.29">kind of the opposite and kind of yeah</text>
  <text start="1965.3" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I do like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1967.46" dur="3.24">part of me that&amp;#39;s like no this is the</text>
  <text start="1969.2" dur="3.84">book burning in me and I want to write</text>
  <text start="1970.7" dur="4.41">it and if only if only five people read</text>
  <text start="1973.04" dur="3.54">it that&amp;#39;s fine obviously I&amp;#39;d rather have</text>
  <text start="1975.11" dur="4.2">like five thousand or something than</text>
  <text start="1976.58" dur="5.19">five but like at the same time with the</text>
  <text start="1979.31" dur="6.06">top like speaking in tongues for example</text>
  <text start="1981.77" dur="5.85">it&amp;#39;s like okay that&amp;#39;s a topic I am ready</text>
  <text start="1985.37" dur="4.83">to burst with like more like dr. Brown&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1987.62" dur="4.68">advice so what do I do about it how do I</text>
  <text start="1990.2" dur="4.83">go about it and I looks at how the lies</text>
  <text start="1992.3" dur="5.22">people believe template works with the</text>
  <text start="1995.03" dur="4.98">healing book because it tells the lit</text>
  <text start="1997.52" dur="4.53">the the reader whether they&amp;#39;re against</text>
  <text start="2000.01" dur="2.58">or for it it tells them exactly what</text>
  <text start="2002.05" dur="2.88">they&amp;#39;re in for</text>
  <text start="2002.59" dur="5.43">a title like that you know right and so</text>
  <text start="2004.93" dur="5.07">tongues is like already it already has</text>
  <text start="2008.02" dur="4.05">built in that like it&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2010" dur="3.39">deconstruct something you know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2012.07" dur="4.5">called lies people believe about</text>
  <text start="2013.39" dur="5.1">speaking tongues and so I don&amp;#39;t pay my</text>
  <text start="2016.57" dur="3.72">rent or anything with the status of this</text>
  <text start="2018.49" dur="3.059">book I mean it sells but it&amp;#39;s not like</text>

  <text start="2021.549" dur="6.09">I bought my first yacht no that&amp;#39;s not I</text>
  <text start="2026.11" dur="3.449">don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know what people</text>
  <text start="2027.639" dur="4.41">think about like when and they they hear</text>
  <text start="2029.559" dur="3.72">about a book being successful that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2032.049" dur="3.33">that&amp;#39;s one thing I want to make sure</text>
  <text start="2033.279" dur="4.02">people know after this discussion is it</text>
  <text start="2035.379" dur="4.41">doesn&amp;#39;t mean like an author is is is</text>
  <text start="2037.299" dur="5.07">making a lot of Bank or living high on</text>
  <text start="2039.789" dur="7.08">the hog now you know like I had a tie to</text>
  <text start="2042.369" dur="5.611">supporters in 2013 in in their letter</text>
  <text start="2046.869" dur="2.43">explaining why they were stopping</text>
  <text start="2047.98" dur="3.75">they&amp;#39;re like well now that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2049.299" dur="4.441">need it it&amp;#39;s like you know it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="2051.73" dur="3.569">what do you mean now that I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="2053.74" dur="3.419">self-published author now that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2055.299" dur="3.54">the self-published rich author who&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2065.74" dur="4.74">it in my doing no but you get the point</text>
  <text start="2067.69" dur="4.919">right but with regard to like analyzing</text>
  <text start="2070.48" dur="4.56">the market and stuff the other downside</text>
  <text start="2072.609" dur="4.831">of that is people writing because they</text>
  <text start="2075.04" dur="4.98">want to make money and writing like</text>
  <text start="2077.44" dur="4.439">books fill voids but they aren&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="2080.02" dur="3.389">aren&amp;#39;t very good and so I think there</text>
  <text start="2081.879" dur="5.76">needs to be kind of like a combination</text>
  <text start="2083.409" dur="7.41">of your passion as a writer mixing with</text>
  <text start="2087.639" dur="4.95">what void do I see that this can fill</text>
  <text start="2090.819" dur="2.941">but you know I mean because because we</text>
  <text start="2092.589" dur="4.381">probably get some of the same emails I</text>
  <text start="2093.76" dur="5.7">do from people about like Kindle spy and</text>
  <text start="2096.97" dur="4.619">Kindle you know how to find what books</text>
  <text start="2099.46" dur="4.109">to write about and outsource and all</text>
  <text start="2101.589" dur="4.77">these things and my wife and I took some</text>
  <text start="2103.569" dur="5.221">online classes to learn how to target</text>
  <text start="2106.359" dur="4.621">certain sectors of the market how to</text>
  <text start="2108.79" dur="4.019">find a weak area in the market that</text>
  <text start="2110.98" dur="3.78">needs another book to be written yeah I</text>
  <text start="2112.809" dur="5.341">mean we learned all that stuff a lot of</text>
  <text start="2114.76" dur="6.24">that information I don&amp;#39;t use right but</text>
  <text start="2118.15" dur="5.13">my conscience doesn&amp;#39;t let me it&amp;#39;s a hard</text>
  <text start="2121" dur="4.349">thing to pin down because like you had</text>
  <text start="2123.28" dur="4.65">this really strong passion to write this</text>
  <text start="2125.349" dur="5.25">book on tongues it was burning and</text>
  <text start="2127.93" dur="4.619">inside of you it was bursting to get out</text>
  <text start="2130.599" dur="4.291">and I have some books like that in me</text>
  <text start="2132.549" dur="4.351">but actually the fictional book is</text>
  <text start="2134.89" dur="4.14">burning inside of me to get out I really</text>
  <text start="2136.9" dur="3.36">want to write that book the problem is I</text>
  <text start="2139.03" dur="3.66">know it&amp;#39;s going to take me about six</text>
  <text start="2140.26" dur="3.87">months of hardcore sitting down every</text>
  <text start="2142.69" dur="3">day and writing to get that book out and</text>
  <text start="2144.13" dur="3.8">I just have to set the time aside to do</text>
  <text start="2145.69" dur="4.919">it I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of wisdom in</text>
  <text start="2147.93" dur="4.35">tapping into your passion what is the</text>
  <text start="2150.609" dur="4.801">subject that you&amp;#39;re passionate about and</text>
  <text start="2152.28" dur="5.98">start with that and write with that and</text>
  <text start="2155.41" dur="5.28">a really good manuscript and don&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2158.26" dur="4.17">afraid to edit the snot out of it keep</text>
  <text start="2160.69" dur="4.32">you know revising the manuscript and</text>
  <text start="2162.43" dur="4.35">refining it because you and I both know</text>
  <text start="2165.01" dur="3.529">there&amp;#39;s a lot of really mediocre books</text>
  <text start="2166.78" dur="4.529">out there by self-published authors that</text>
  <text start="2168.539" dur="5.111">could be done a lot better if the person</text>
  <text start="2171.309" dur="3.48">sat down and thought through the process</text>
  <text start="2173.65" dur="4.199">a little more and spent a little more</text>
  <text start="2174.789" dur="5.04">time reworking the manuscript I think</text>
  <text start="2177.849" dur="5.19">one of the weaknesses of self-published</text>
  <text start="2179.829" dur="5.071">authors is when you submit a book to a</text>
  <text start="2183.039" dur="3.661">traditional publisher they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="2184.9" dur="3.63">an editor who&amp;#39;s going to go over it and</text>
  <text start="2186.7" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to give you back the</text>
  <text start="2188.53" dur="4.95">manuscript and say fix these things so</text>
  <text start="2191.44" dur="4.44">having an editor kind of forces you to a</text>
  <text start="2193.48" dur="3.78">little higher level of writing and can I</text>
  <text start="2195.88" dur="2.82">can I take you back on that</text>
  <text start="2197.26" dur="4.049">yeah jump it because because if we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2198.7" dur="5.7">going to talk about ranking oh it would</text>
  <text start="2201.309" dur="4.8">behoove us to cover editing - you and I</text>
  <text start="2204.4" dur="4.86">both have followed Frank viola for a</text>
  <text start="2206.109" dur="6.301">while Frank&amp;#39;s advice to you know writers</text>
  <text start="2209.26" dur="5.339">is you should have an editor you should</text>
  <text start="2212.41" dur="4.77">let your editor do their job don&amp;#39;t make</text>
  <text start="2214.599" dur="4.861">a head a writer and don&amp;#39;t try to</text>
  <text start="2217.18" dur="5.49">short-circuit the process of thinking</text>
  <text start="2219.46" dur="5.01">you don&amp;#39;t need one and I yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2222.67" dur="4.949">what amazes me is how many people I know</text>
  <text start="2224.47" dur="5.099">just refuse to do that I don&amp;#39;t wanna use</text>
  <text start="2227.619" dur="2.49">the word refuse but like reserves you</text>
  <text start="2229.569" dur="2.76">can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2230.109" dur="4.771">yeah you can&amp;#39;t persuade them of the</text>
  <text start="2232.329" dur="4.621">value of that I&amp;#39;ve got friends who&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2234.88" dur="4.89">self-published books and and what they</text>
  <text start="2236.95" dur="4.53">have to share is good and then you see</text>

  <text start="2810.51" dur="4.32">grammatical errors and punctuation</text>
  <text start="2812.49" dur="4.83">problems and the flow of thought is</text>
  <text start="2814.83" dur="3.69">completely disjointed if those are their</text>
  <text start="2817.32" dur="4.44">complaints then they have a legitimate</text>
  <text start="2818.52" dur="5.28">beef right and when I started working</text>
  <text start="2821.76" dur="3.84">with Lydia I remember we were on</text>
  <text start="2823.8" dur="5.52">on the healing book and we got to like</text>
  <text start="2825.6" dur="7.89">chapter 12 and she basically said okay</text>
  <text start="2829.32" dur="5.73">look this chapter has huge problems you</text>
  <text start="2833.49" dur="5.04">may end up rewriting the whole check</text>
  <text start="2835.05" dur="7.23">freak app and she said you know in the</text>
  <text start="2838.53" dur="6.63">last chapters your thought process was</text>
  <text start="2842.28" dur="4.74">very consistent you gave some scriptures</text>
  <text start="2845.16" dur="4.11">you gave some illustrations you gave a</text>
  <text start="2847.02" dur="4.53">couple of testimonies and everything</text>
  <text start="2849.27" dur="4.02">flowed really well in this chapter it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2851.55" dur="3.69">all disjointed you don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="2853.29" dur="4.38">illustrations at all there&amp;#39;s just no</text>
  <text start="2855.24" dur="4.35">consistency from chapter to chapter so</text>
  <text start="2857.67" dur="3.54">she pretty much took me to task and she</text>
  <text start="2859.59" dur="3.96">said you need to provide some</text>
  <text start="2861.21" dur="4.17">illustrations you need to write this</text>
  <text start="2863.55" dur="3.42">chapter like you wrote the last two so</text>
  <text start="2865.38" dur="4.44">go back to work the drawing board and</text>
  <text start="2866.97" dur="5.55">rewrite this chapter and I realized she</text>
  <text start="2869.82" dur="4.92">was right I had pretty much gotten tired</text>
  <text start="2872.52" dur="5.37">of writing for that particular chapter</text>
  <text start="2874.74" dur="5.67">and I turned in a c-minus paper right</text>
  <text start="2877.89" dur="4.56">she said look this is not gonna fly you</text>
  <text start="2880.41" dur="4.47">have to do better than this and so I</text>
  <text start="2882.45" dur="4.68">added a whole lot more content and I</text>
  <text start="2884.88" dur="3.48">refloat everything and it turned out to</text>
  <text start="2887.13" dur="3.3">be a much better chapter when it was</text>
  <text start="2888.36" dur="4.14">done but you have to be willing to do</text>
  <text start="2890.43" dur="4.11">that work with an editor because a good</text>
  <text start="2892.5" dur="5.85">editor well says you&amp;#39;re out of you the</text>
  <text start="2894.54" dur="6.42">best writing is possible right yeah and</text>

  <text start="3251.869" dur="5.461">it some more umph so so I went did that</text>
  <text start="3255.02" dur="5.01">and there&amp;#39;s one book II recommended in</text>
  <text start="3257.33" dur="4.8">particular it was not a commentary but</text>
  <text start="3260.03" dur="5.339">it was some kind of work about Luke and</text>
  <text start="3262.13" dur="5.43">acts and there were some points in there</text>
  <text start="3265.369" dur="4.681">that I&amp;#39;m like oh my goodness I&amp;#39;m so glad</text>
  <text start="3267.56" dur="5.01">I read this first that I was already</text>
  <text start="3270.05" dur="5.64">kind of saying but like okay being able</text>
  <text start="3272.57" dur="5.549">to quote and reference this really not</text>
  <text start="3275.69" dur="4.2">wrapped it up a few notches and so</text>
  <text start="3278.119" dur="6.631">because he knew that&amp;#39;s what I was going</text>
  <text start="3279.89" dur="6.69">for I valued his input at that stage so</text>
  <text start="3284.75" dur="3.869">you know Christmas holidays that year</text>

  <text start="3294.8" dur="3.84">then with that being said it was</text>
  <text start="3297.26" dur="3.48">probably four or five thousand words</text>
  <text start="3298.64" dur="5.01">longer than it would have been you know</text>
  <text start="3300.74" dur="4.8">mostly from from references and adding a</text>
  <text start="3303.65" dur="4.38">few extra paragraphs after reading some</text>
  <text start="3305.54" dur="4.38">of those those books but I look at it</text>
