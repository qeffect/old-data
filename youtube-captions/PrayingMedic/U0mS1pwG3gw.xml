  <text start="76.92" dur="4.08">there what their capabilities are he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="79.08" dur="5.579">trolling Kim jong-eun because he knows</text>
  <text start="81" dur="7.47">Kim Jong you can&amp;#39;t do anything you know</text>
  <text start="84.659" dur="8.401">our intelligence is really good it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="7.289">very likely that we could mess up any</text>
  <text start="93.06" dur="7.11">missile launch that they have at anytime</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="6.211">we want so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s okay for Trump to</text>
  <text start="100.17" dur="4.62">troll Kim jong-un kiss Trump is in a</text>
  <text start="101.97" dur="4.679">position of greater power so may not be</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="8.64">professional people may not like it but</text>
  <text start="106.649" dur="9.301">it is what it is so in all the drama the</text>
  <text start="113.43" dur="4.71">wash up last night North Korea and South</text>
  <text start="115.95" dur="5.37">Korea there are some changes there was a</text>
  <text start="118.14" dur="6">actually a hotline kind of like the red</text>
  <text start="121.32" dur="5.64">phone that Reagan used to have to</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="4.8">Gorbachev in the the Kremlin there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="126.96" dur="4.23">red phone as a hotline between South</text>
  <text start="128.94" dur="4.29">Korea and North Korea that hotline got</text>
  <text start="131.19" dur="4.409">cut a couple years ago they just</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="5.55">got rid of it North Korea didn&amp;#39;t want it</text>
  <text start="135.599" dur="4.321">and last night North Korea is real said</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.23">they&amp;#39;re going to re-establish that</text>
  <text start="139.92" dur="5.67">hotline of communication between North</text>
  <text start="143.01" dur="5.52">and South Korea and there&amp;#39;s been a lot</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="5.91">of discussions about re-establishing</text>
  <text start="148.53" dur="4.47">communication having negotiations over</text>
  <text start="151.5" dur="5.58">the Olympics and some other things too</text>
  <text start="153" dur="6.51">so I think what we&amp;#39;re seeing as far as</text>
  <text start="157.08" dur="5.129">diplomacy goes from North Korea towards</text>
  <text start="159.51" dur="6.42">South Korea is good they seem to be</text>
  <text start="162.209" dur="6.03">warming up to diplomatic relations read</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="3.96">a story that and actually this these</text>
  <text start="168.239" dur="4.171">have been several stories if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="169.89" dur="5.52">Twitter and you don&amp;#39;t follow this</text>
  <text start="172.41" dur="6.87">account called noon in Korea you might</text>
  <text start="175.41" dur="5.4">want to follow them I like them they the</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="5.28">person who is in charge of that account</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="5.819">used to live in North Korea they publish</text>
  <text start="184.56" dur="5.069">regular news updates and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="186.629" dur="5.19">just on current events political events</text>
  <text start="189.629" dur="4.621">and the military in North and South</text>
  <text start="191.819" dur="4.95">Korea in that whole area and they</text>
  <text start="194.25" dur="4.709">publish it both in Korean and English so</text>
  <text start="196.769" dur="5.22">you can read the updates there I like</text>
  <text start="198.959" dur="4.71">getting their updates it helps me keep</text>
  <text start="201.989" dur="4.411">my finger on the pulse of what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="203.669" dur="6.121">on over there in North and South Korea</text>
  <text start="206.4" dur="4.89">so just throwing that out there they had</text>
  <text start="209.79" dur="2.97">been reporting that soldiers have been</text>
  <text start="211.29" dur="4.49">defecting over the last couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="212.76" dur="6.69">and interestingly usually when a soldier</text>
  <text start="215.78" dur="5.679">or anyone defects from North Korea to</text>
  <text start="219.45" dur="4.71">South Korea across the Demilitarized</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="5.851">Zone they don&amp;#39;t usually survive they get</text>
  <text start="224.16" dur="5.189">shot to be a defector from North Korea</text>
  <text start="227.31" dur="3.929">is pretty much a death sentence well</text>
  <text start="229.349" dur="3.901">lately they haven&amp;#39;t been shooting at</text>
  <text start="231.239" dur="4.231">people who are defecting they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="233.25" dur="4.079">letting them go across the border that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.47" dur="3.71">one of the reports that I read and</text>
  <text start="237.329" dur="4.711">that&amp;#39;s been for a couple of weeks now</text>
  <text start="239.18" dur="4.929">there are also new reports coming out</text>
  <text start="242.04" dur="5.069">that North Korea is allowing their</text>
  <text start="244.109" dur="5.46">soldiers temporary leave to go out into</text>
  <text start="247.109" dur="3.63">the country and look for food because if</text>
  <text start="249.569" dur="2.64">you know much about North Korea there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="250.739" dur="6.78">not a lot of food and it&amp;#39;s winter right</text>
  <text start="252.209" dur="6.9">now and so there are some reports coming</text>
  <text start="257.519" dur="3.541">out that North Korea is allowing their</text>
  <text start="259.109" dur="4.411">soldiers several weeks of leave to go</text>
  <text start="261.06" dur="3.78">and find food so there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="3.119">interesting things going on in North</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="3.81">Korea and I think</text>
  <text start="266.639" dur="5.731">mostly what I&amp;#39;m seeing is I&amp;#39;m optimistic</text>
  <text start="268.65" dur="6.599">about there are people who are talking</text>
  <text start="272.37" dur="4.47">about World War three and nullus threat</text>
  <text start="275.249" dur="4.38">of nuclear war I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="276.84" dur="5.819">realistic threat right now not in the</text>
  <text start="279.629" dur="6.81">immediate future no one that I I follow</text>
  <text start="282.659" dur="5.611">a lot of different intelligence sources</text>
  <text start="286.439" dur="3.961">and no one that I&amp;#39;m listening to and</text>
  <text start="288.27" dur="5.07">seeing is concerned about eminent threat</text>
  <text start="290.4" dur="6.06">of nuclear war so I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.34" dur="6.479">something we need to worry about going</text>
  <text start="296.46" dur="5.579">to Iran the protests are continuing the</text>
  <text start="299.819" dur="4.5">Islamic Revolutionary Guard has gotten</text>
  <text start="302.039" dur="4.711">involved in trying to put down the</text>
  <text start="304.319" dur="5.31">protesters it&amp;#39;s turned more violent</text>
  <text start="306.75" dur="4.379">people are getting killed that is just a</text>
  <text start="309.629" dur="3.481">situation that&amp;#39;s developing we need to</text>
  <text start="311.129" dur="4.141">keep those people in prayer and keep our</text>
  <text start="313.11" dur="6.39">leaders in prayer Mike Pence has been</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="8.1">focusing a lot on the situation in Iran</text>
  <text start="319.5" dur="6.08">and he actually had a trip to the Middle</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="5.4">East plan before Christmas that was</text>
  <text start="325.58" dur="5.109">cancelled because of the tax vote he had</text>
  <text start="328.77" dur="4.079">to be there too in case he needed to</text>
  <text start="330.689" dur="3.78">break the tie well they were going to</text>
  <text start="332.849" dur="3.18">reschedule his trip to the Middle East</text>
  <text start="334.469" dur="4.35">and now it&amp;#39;s been postponed indefinitely</text>
  <text start="336.029" dur="5.31">so we don&amp;#39;t know when pence is going to</text>
  <text start="338.819" dur="5.46">be going to the Middle East and the</text>
  <text start="341.339" dur="9.51">situation in Iran just popped up so they</text>
  <text start="344.279" dur="7.831">may want to include a stop possibly for</text>
  <text start="350.849" dur="4.32">the vice president when that situation</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="5.91">comes a little bit more into focus</text>
  <text start="355.169" dur="5.101">that&amp;#39;s its situation as influx may just</text>
  <text start="358.02" dur="8.819">keep keep the president vice president</text>
  <text start="360.27" dur="8.069">prayer turning to the u.s. news oh you</text>
  <text start="366.839" dur="4.35">know I can throw this out there I&amp;#39;ve</text>
