  <text start="385.039" dur="3.361">you just can&amp;#39;t absorb the information</text>
  <text start="386.689" dur="4.171">enough like there&amp;#39;s things that you</text>
  <text start="388.4" dur="4.62">could go back and then you missed before</text>

  <text start="393.02" dur="5.97">attention to yeah did you finish reading</text>
  <text start="395.389" dur="5.071">Michael Van Diemen&amp;#39;s book yes if you go</text>

  <text start="400.46" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;ll probably be some things that</text>
  <text start="402.439" dur="4.621">will connect that you didn&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="404.029" dur="5.85">first time because I wrote my book after</text>
  <text start="407.06" dur="4.259">I read Michael&amp;#39;s book make a list kind</text>
  <text start="409.879" dur="4.35">of the inspiration for me to write my</text>
  <text start="411.319" dur="5.96">book when I read his book I was like yes</text>
  <text start="414.229" dur="5.12">exactly everyone can see in the spirit</text>
  <text start="417.279" dur="3.21">and he touched on some points there</text>
  <text start="419.349" dur="3.72">about the imagination</text>
  <text start="420.489" dur="4.92">and I thought I want to learn to write a</text>
  <text start="423.069" dur="4.35">book that elaborated a little bit more</text>
  <text start="425.409" dur="4.62">on those same points and kind of flesh</text>
  <text start="427.419" dur="4.77">that out and gave some exercises so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="430.029" dur="6.05">glad that you&amp;#39;ve enjoyed this book yeah</text>
  <text start="432.189" dur="7.17">yeah I am that so many people are</text>
  <text start="436.079" dur="5.5">discounting their imagination like</text>
  <text start="439.359" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re discounting their mind&amp;#39;s eye</text>
  <text start="441.579" dur="5.1">because they think oh that&amp;#39;s just me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="444.309" dur="4.68">just thinking that right and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="446.679" dur="5.431">constantly when I&amp;#39;m in that what I would</text>
  <text start="448.989" dur="6.45">consider soaking time I&amp;#39;m constantly</text>
  <text start="452.11" dur="5.969">submitting my mind to the Lord and the</text>
  <text start="455.439" dur="4.88">Holy Spirit - and I try to just focus</text>
  <text start="458.079" dur="4.89">until he takes over and that is</text>
  <text start="460.319" dur="6.76">absolutely it&amp;#39;s like change my life</text>
  <text start="462.969" dur="7.02">we&amp;#39;re not very good waiters we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="467.079" dur="5.31">don&amp;#39;t do well wait and listen is that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="469.989" dur="3.84">not what I had been doing and that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="472.389" dur="4.56">thing that a lot of people struggle with</text>
  <text start="473.829" dur="4.35">is and I try to point this out in the</text>
  <text start="476.949" dur="3.63">book especially the book on seeing in</text>
  <text start="478.179" dur="4.71">the spirit there is a significant amount</text>
  <text start="480.579" dur="4.26">of time where you have to be very quiet</text>
  <text start="482.889" dur="5.221">and you have to learn how to steal your</text>
  <text start="484.839" dur="5.04">soul and be quiet and to not everything</text>
  <text start="488.11" dur="3.929">you know not listen to the radio and the</text>
  <text start="489.879" dur="4.83">TV and people talking in the background</text>
  <text start="492.039" dur="4.53">you have to really be still and know</text>
  <text start="494.709" dur="4.35">that I am God I mean that&amp;#39;s really the</text>
  <text start="496.569" dur="5.01">big key to hearing God&amp;#39;s voice and sing</text>
  <text start="499.059" dur="4.47">in the spirit is that waiting time and</text>
  <text start="501.579" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s not an issue that God isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="503.529" dur="4.65">speaking and isn&amp;#39;t giving us revelation</text>
  <text start="505.509" dur="6.18">he is it just takes a while for our soul</text>
  <text start="508.179" dur="7.14">and our spirit to receive it and process</text>
  <text start="511.689" dur="5.22">it and a lot of that comes with having</text>
  <text start="515.319" dur="2.791">our spiritual eyes trained I know that</text>
  <text start="516.909" dur="4.23">my wife and I have been talking a lot</text>
  <text start="518.11" dur="5.609">it&amp;#39;s really funny ever since she read</text>
  <text start="521.139" dur="4.2">Michael Van vitamines book she started</text>
  <text start="523.719" dur="4.68">doing some of the exercises he had in</text>
  <text start="525.339" dur="5.761">his book and very gradually over the</text>
  <text start="528.399" dur="4.891">course of I would say probably four or</text>
  <text start="531.1" dur="3.87">five months she started to see a little</text>
  <text start="533.29" dur="3.45">bit more in the spirit she never really</text>
  <text start="534.97" dur="3.75">saw anything I would say honey just</text>
  <text start="536.74" dur="4.139">close your eyes and she&amp;#39;d say every time</text>
  <text start="538.72" dur="3.719">I close my eyes I just see black but the</text>
  <text start="540.879" dur="5.4">funny thing is as she spent more time</text>
  <text start="542.439" dur="5.971">with her eyes closed with her soul being</text>
  <text start="546.279" dur="4.951">still and waiting upon the Lord to show</text>
  <text start="548.41" dur="5.97">her things she has gradually seen</text>
  <text start="551.23" dur="4.86">more and I think she&amp;#39;s to a point now</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="4.89">where most of the time when she closes</text>
  <text start="556.09" dur="4.98">her eyes there are visions that she sees</text>
  <text start="559.27" dur="4.53">in the spiritual world that are there</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="4.47">almost all the time yeah and she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="563.8" dur="3.87">seeing a lot of horses and she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="565.54" dur="4.2">know exactly what that means I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="567.67" dur="3.21">know what it means either you see horses</text>
  <text start="569.74" dur="4.02">I see</text>
  <text start="570.88" dur="7.68">yeah in America one of the first things</text>
  <text start="573.76" dur="8.97">that he showed me was a white horse on</text>
  <text start="578.56" dur="7.89">the beach and actually I wasn&amp;#39;t on it we</text>
  <text start="582.73" dur="5.37">were walking with it and then that was</text>
  <text start="586.45" dur="3.44">that was a vision that he showed me it</text>
  <text start="588.1" dur="5.31">was very peaceful but then fast forward</text>
  <text start="589.89" dur="5.83">probably a week later he showed me a</text>
  <text start="593.41" dur="5.15">brown horse a black horse and a white</text>
  <text start="595.72" dur="7.05">horse that were all in a fenced in area</text>
  <text start="598.56" dur="6.82">but the white horse was the was the one</text>
  <text start="602.77" dur="4.98">that was up like close to us that were</text>
  <text start="605.38" dur="5.25">what you consider interacting when the</text>
  <text start="607.75" dur="5.94">other two were just sort of walking</text>
  <text start="610.63" dur="4.65">around yeah interesting and Michael</text>
  <text start="613.69" dur="3.78">asked me you know or what does that mean</text>
  <text start="615.28" dur="6.06">I don&amp;#39;t really know what it means I do</text>
  <text start="617.47" dur="6.33">know that for most people when they get</text>
  <text start="621.34" dur="4.29">in that time period where their</text>
  <text start="623.8" dur="3.98">spiritual eyes are being trained the</text>
  <text start="625.63" dur="4.68">Lord will show them different images</text>
  <text start="627.78" dur="5.62">some of which have some relevance to</text>
  <text start="630.31" dur="4.62">them like my wife really likes horses so</text>
  <text start="633.4" dur="4.41">the Lord is just showing her I think</text>
  <text start="634.93" dur="4.98">subjects that she&amp;#39;s interested in to</text>
  <text start="637.81" dur="4.47">captivate her to get her interest</text>
  <text start="639.91" dur="5.93">so she&amp;#39;s focusing on what he&amp;#39;s showing</text>
  <text start="642.28" dur="7.65">her and it&amp;#39;s just part of her training</text>
  <text start="645.84" dur="6.91">as she focuses more and learns to see</text>
  <text start="649.93" dur="4.43">with more clarity because a lot of the</text>
  <text start="652.75" dur="4.77">images that she sees are either</text>
  <text start="654.36" dur="5.95">black-and-white gray tones or they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="657.52" dur="4.8">not real sharp and focus but I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="660.31" dur="5.58">noticed and this happens with most</text>
  <text start="662.32" dur="6.65">people the longer you focus and wait on</text>
  <text start="665.89" dur="5.91">the Lord the more those images come into</text>
  <text start="668.97" dur="5.29">sharper focus you see more color more</text>
  <text start="671.8" dur="5.1">detail and as time goes on everything</text>
  <text start="674.26" dur="5.73">just gets more more vivid and it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="676.9" dur="4.08">of cool I&amp;#39;ve noticed and it&amp;#39;s like as a</text>
  <text start="679.99" dur="4.8">matter of fact I just want to do it all</text>
  <text start="680.98" dur="5.76">the time well yeah I mean it once</text>

  <text start="884.89" dur="5.58">okay I will say this you&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="888.58" dur="5.79">listen to about three or four videos and</text>
  <text start="890.47" dur="6.9">get the lingo down if you&amp;#39;re not used to</text>
  <text start="894.37" dur="4.89">people talking about experiences in the</text>
  <text start="897.37" dur="3.36">heavenly realms you&amp;#39;ll have to bear with</text>
  <text start="899.26" dur="4.68">them until you get the lingo down</text>
  <text start="900.73" dur="7.26">because the heavens are very very</text>
  <text start="903.94" dur="6.75">complex so when I talk about going to</text>
  <text start="907.99" dur="5.1">the court of heaven there&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="910.69" dur="3.54">many courts in heaven then there are</text>
  <text start="913.09" dur="2.91">there are many different courts for</text>
  <text start="914.23" dur="4.92">different purposes just like there are</text>
  <text start="916" dur="5.19">in the world like we have municipal</text>
  <text start="919.15" dur="4.23">courts we have county courts we have</text>
  <text start="921.19" dur="3.63">state court supreme courts different</text>
  <text start="923.38" dur="3.66">levels of Courts for different purposes</text>
  <text start="924.82" dur="3.42">heaven has the same thing heaven has a</text>
  <text start="927.04" dur="4.049">lot of different courts for different</text>
  <text start="928.24" dur="5.16">purposes so Mike talks about the</text>
  <text start="931.089" dur="3.691">different types of courts and the other</text>
  <text start="933.4" dur="3.81">thing that one of the things that Mike</text>
  <text start="934.78" dur="3.75">talks a lot about is mountains a lot of</text>
  <text start="937.21" dur="2.79">people aren&amp;#39;t aware of this but if you</text>
  <text start="938.53" dur="5.73">look at how often Jesus spoke about</text>
  <text start="940" dur="7.86">mountains in the Gospels in a sense who</text>
  <text start="944.26" dur="6.27">is using allegory but in a real sense</text>
  <text start="947.86" dur="3.97">there are mountains in the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="950.53" dur="2.89">heaven</text>
  <text start="951.83" dur="3.9">and the mountains are the places that we</text>
  <text start="953.42" dur="4.58">rule from so I mic talks a lot about</text>
  <text start="955.73" dur="4.47">mountains he talks a lot about Scrolls</text>
  <text start="958" dur="5.89">when you go into the heavens you can get</text>
  <text start="960.2" dur="7.41">scrolls and Men dates from heaven I have</text>
  <text start="963.89" dur="8.76">received a number of scrolls sometimes I</text>
  <text start="967.61" dur="6.69">put them in dreams sometimes I when I go</text>
  <text start="972.65" dur="5.64">to a the court of heavens and I</text>
  <text start="974.3" dur="6.81">represent people usually I will ask for</text>
  <text start="978.29" dur="4.26">a scroll to be given to me and whenever</text>
  <text start="981.11" dur="4.08">you go to the court if you get a</text>
  <text start="982.55" dur="4.74">judgment against an adversary you should</text>
  <text start="985.19" dur="3.45">ask for a scroll and the judge will</text>
  <text start="987.29" dur="3.12">usually have a scroll written out and</text>
  <text start="988.64" dur="3.27">give it to you you can hang on to it</text>
  <text start="990.41" dur="3.77">when the enemy comes to harass you can</text>
  <text start="991.91" dur="7.14">go I got a scroll leave me alone</text>
  <text start="994.18" dur="6.22">get out of here so if you&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="999.05" dur="4.74">interested in growing and being</text>
  <text start="1000.4" dur="7.44">stretched that stuff will really</text>
  <text start="1003.79" dur="7.26">challenge you so um shifting gears here</text>
  <text start="1007.84" dur="5.46">you know a lot of people take the view</text>
  <text start="1011.05" dur="3.99">that the world is getting worse and</text>
  <text start="1013.3" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re sliding towards darkness and</text>
  <text start="1015.04" dur="5.7">everything&amp;#39;s getting more evil and in a</text>
  <text start="1017.47" dur="5.52">sense that&amp;#39;s true if you&amp;#39;re over fifty</text>
  <text start="1020.74" dur="4.95">years old for example and I am you can</text>
  <text start="1022.99" dur="4.83">look back during the 1950s or 60s and</text>
  <text start="1025.69" dur="4.23">see a lifestyle it was very simple it</text>
  <text start="1027.82" dur="6.3">seemed like society was more civilized</text>
  <text start="1029.92" dur="7.529">it seemed like sin if it was as common</text>
  <text start="1034.12" dur="5.31">wasn&amp;#39;t as open and talked about a lot of</text>
  <text start="1037.449" dur="4.291">people just say look at how society is</text>
  <text start="1039.43" dur="4.59">today looking at was 3040 years ago</text>
  <text start="1041.74" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s a huge change and it&amp;#39;s gotten</text>
  <text start="1044.02" dur="8.01">worse well that may be true but the cool</text>
  <text start="1048.64" dur="6.6">thing is this thirty years ago you would</text>
  <text start="1052.03" dur="5.04">never have seen groups of people going</text>
  <text start="1055.24" dur="3.75">out to shopping malls and laying hands</text>
  <text start="1057.07" dur="4.67">on people and doing street healing and</text>
  <text start="1058.99" dur="5.97">deliverance right that did not happen</text>
  <text start="1061.74" dur="6.91">people going out and giving prophetic</text>
  <text start="1064.96" dur="6.03">words and street healing is just an</text>
  <text start="1068.65" dur="5.58">example a small example of a ways in</text>
  <text start="1070.99" dur="5.34">which God is addressing the increasing</text>
  <text start="1074.23" dur="5.19">darkness in the world I have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1076.33" dur="5.76">friends who are finally going into</text>
  <text start="1079.42" dur="4.53">heavens and they&amp;#39;re figuring out what it</text>
  <text start="1082.09" dur="2.95">is that God has actually called them to</text>
  <text start="1083.95" dur="3.07">do</text>
  <text start="1085.04" dur="4.02">getting a handle on their mandates their</text>
  <text start="1087.02" dur="3.9">heavenly mandates they&amp;#39;re learning how</text>
  <text start="1089.06" dur="3.81">to cooperate with angels they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1090.92" dur="5.82">learning how to rule and reign with</text>
  <text start="1092.87" dur="5.79">Jesus in the kingdom on their mountains</text>
  <text start="1096.74" dur="5.46">and they&amp;#39;re learning to extend their</text>
  <text start="1098.66" dur="5.91">sphere of influence in the world and as</text>
  <text start="1102.2" dur="5.28">much as the world is kind of growing</text>
  <text start="1104.57" dur="4.82">darker in a way some of the saints are</text>
  <text start="1107.48" dur="4.23">really starting to shine their light</text>
  <text start="1109.39" dur="6.1">well if you think about it when the</text>
  <text start="1111.71" dur="7.32">kingdom of God is advancing there&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="1115.49" dur="7.08">aware of what is going on so therefore</text>
  <text start="1119.03" dur="6.48">he&amp;#39;s ramping up is that the Lord has</text>
  <text start="1122.57" dur="5.94">seen the encouragement of evil and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1125.51" dur="5.13">training his Saints to address it yeah I</text>
  <text start="1128.51" dur="4.53">believe that I mean I believe it I I</text>
  <text start="1130.64" dur="4.44">know that we could possibly you know</text>
  <text start="1133.04" dur="5.4">come up against something you know</text>
  <text start="1135.08" dur="7.89">that&amp;#39;s challenging but I also know that</text>
  <text start="1138.44" dur="6.87">I feel very peaceful about us like</text>
  <text start="1142.97" dur="4.86">meaning that he is going to protect his</text>
  <text start="1145.31" dur="4.5">people I think so too I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1147.83" dur="5.67">going to some very difficult challenges</text>
  <text start="1149.81" dur="5.55">ahead but I think that the Lord has seen</text>
  <text start="1153.5" dur="5.82">those challenges far enough in advance</text>
  <text start="1155.36" dur="6.12">and he has put his people into action to</text>
  <text start="1159.32" dur="3.99">get people trained and equipped so that</text>
  <text start="1161.48" dur="4.86">when those difficulties come we&amp;#39;re ready</text>
  <text start="1163.31" dur="4.29">for them and he&amp;#39;s going to protect us he</text>
  <text start="1166.34" dur="4.05">is training and equipping us right now</text>
  <text start="1167.6" dur="4.41">to deal with him we have not even we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1170.39" dur="3.21">not even touched the surface with signs</text>
  <text start="1172.01" dur="5.49">and wonders that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m excited</text>
  <text start="1173.6" dur="6.54">although I&amp;#39;m so excited about that he he</text>
  <text start="1177.5" dur="5.16">gave me it was a dream that was so like</text>
  <text start="1180.14" dur="3.96">wow that was such a God dream like a</text>
  <text start="1182.66" dur="3.75">truly when you talk about going to the</text>
  <text start="1184.1" dur="5.7">heaven I did I wasn&amp;#39;t there very long</text>
  <text start="1186.41" dur="7.29">but it was more of the situation of</text>
  <text start="1189.8" dur="6.17">where I was with Christian friends by</text>
  <text start="1193.7" dur="6.09">the way here better my friends in like a</text>
  <text start="1195.97" dur="5.77">very wide-open room and a glass big huge</text>
  <text start="1199.79" dur="3.45">window that looked out into the ocean</text>
  <text start="1201.74" dur="4.41">and all the sudden there was this</text>
  <text start="1203.24" dur="5.91">horrible storm like just dark clouds</text>
  <text start="1206.15" dur="5.22">came as gray all centers you can tell</text>
  <text start="1209.15" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s almost like a wow just a hurricane</text>
  <text start="1211.37" dur="4.83">or what you know this is pretty bad and</text>
  <text start="1213.29" dur="3.85">I looked I kind of was I was talking but</text>
  <text start="1216.2" dur="3.25">I looked and I</text>
  <text start="1217.14" dur="5.039">we don&amp;#39;t have to have this and I</text>
  <text start="1219.45" dur="6.15">literally threw my hands out like I lay</text>
  <text start="1222.179" dur="6.421">hands on the situation I was totally</text>
  <text start="1225.6" dur="5.52">taken up to heaven right when I did that</text>
  <text start="1228.6" dur="5.55">and it happened so fast that was so fast</text>
  <text start="1231.12" dur="5.25">and I went should I thought done just</text>
  <text start="1234.15" dur="5.55">for a second I went I did I do something</text>
  <text start="1236.37" dur="6.059">wrong I go up to the heavens there are</text>
  <text start="1239.7" dur="4.26">all I knew is these were Kings that out</text>
  <text start="1242.429" dur="4.201">that was looking at in the clouds they</text>
  <text start="1243.96" dur="5.13">were all kings and then they didn&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1925.09" dur="4.289">in that way you know it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1926.86" dur="3.899">interesting is several of the people who</text>
  <text start="1929.379" dur="3.961">are going to be contributing to this</text>
  <text start="1930.759" dur="6.181">book and hearing God&amp;#39;s voice that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1933.34" dur="6.719">their mojo they are prophetic feelers</text>

  <text start="1954.61" dur="3.149">going to right from that perspective</text>
  <text start="1955.629" dur="3.93">it&amp;#39;s not just going to be at you know</text>
  <text start="1957.759" dur="4.76">hearing the still small voice there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1959.559" dur="5.37">going to be a lot of different types of</text>
  <text start="1962.519" dur="3.85">perspectives on how God speaks to us and</text>
  <text start="1964.929" dur="3.061">I think some people are going to be very</text>
  <text start="1966.369" dur="3.841">surprised at what they&amp;#39;re going to find</text>
  <text start="1967.99" dur="4.23">in this book yes I can see if you go</text>
  <text start="1970.21" dur="4.14">like if you actually have prophecy given</text>
  <text start="1972.22" dur="4.77">to you then you still like otherwise I</text>
  <text start="1974.35" dur="4.679">guess they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re able to just</text>
  <text start="1976.99" dur="5.34">start talking get this download from God</text>
  <text start="1979.029" dur="6.36">and you just start to speak over the</text>
  <text start="1982.33" dur="6.209">person like meaning prophesying but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1985.389" dur="5.13">like you&amp;#39;re getting the verbal - like</text>
  <text start="1988.539" dur="4.14">sticky I I don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s not how he at</text>
  <text start="1990.519" dur="3.9">least he&amp;#39;s used me if I&amp;#39;ve actually</text>
  <text start="1992.679" dur="4.141">depended on the undal you&amp;#39;ll give me</text>
  <text start="1994.419" dur="5.521">pictures I&amp;#39;ll get images and then I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1996.82" dur="5.52">going off the images yeah most of the</text>
  <text start="1999.94" dur="5.55">time when i prophesy i get the images</text>
  <text start="2002.34" dur="6.049">and i interpret the images and then</text>
  <text start="2005.49" dur="4.799">speak to them from the images I see</text>
  <text start="2008.389" dur="3.88">sometimes I&amp;#39;ve noticed what the load</text>
  <text start="2010.289" dur="4.921">will do is he&amp;#39;ll give me one or two</text>
  <text start="2012.269" dur="6.331">images to start and I&amp;#39;ll start to speak</text>
  <text start="2015.21" dur="5.579">from the images and as I get going then</text>
  <text start="2018.6" dur="4.29">inspires me he gives me thoughts and</text>
  <text start="2020.789" dur="5.13">downloads and then he starts to speak</text>
  <text start="2022.89" dur="5.539">through me as I&amp;#39;m talking anyone can do</text>
  <text start="2025.919" dur="7.081">that it takes a little bit of practice</text>
  <text start="2028.429" dur="6.431">some people yes some people they just</text>
  <text start="2033" dur="3.72">get those thought impressions and they</text>
  <text start="2034.86" dur="3.929">start to speak and then the load takes</text>
  <text start="2036.72" dur="3.589">over and just start speaking through</text>
  <text start="2038.789" dur="3.661">them and they get that inspiration</text>
  <text start="2040.309" dur="4.75">there&amp;#39;s a lot of different ways you know</text>
  <text start="2042.45" dur="4.5">prophecy works yeah and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2045.059" dur="3.721">so many more people would really</text>
  <text start="2046.95" dur="5.13">understand they&amp;#39;re actually hearing from</text>
  <text start="2048.78" dur="7.02">God if they if they really realized how</text>
  <text start="2052.08" dur="6.15">many different ways yeah well no the</text>
  <text start="2055.8" dur="5.099">funny thing is with the singing spirit</text>
  <text start="2058.23" dur="6.389">book the most common feedback I got from</text>
  <text start="2060.899" dur="6.27">people who read the book was oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="2064.619" dur="4.591">I think I&amp;#39;ve been seeing visions for a</text>
  <text start="2067.169" dur="4.47">long time and I didn&amp;#39;t know what was</text>
