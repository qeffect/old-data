  <text start="95.09" dur="6.449">wanted to go a little bit more into the</text>
  <text start="97.03" dur="6.46">process of publishing books we both are</text>
  <text start="101.539" dur="4.531">seeing some interesting trends in</text>
  <text start="103.49" dur="6.019">publishing the advent of digital print</text>
  <text start="106.07" dur="5.13">on demand and ebooks I think Amazon is</text>
  <text start="109.509" dur="4.691">predicting that they&amp;#39;re going to be more</text>
  <text start="111.2" dur="4.949">ebooks sold in 2016 than print books for</text>
  <text start="114.2" dur="3.779">the first time in history really I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="116.149" dur="4.08">heard that already before I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="117.979" dur="3.93">really I don&amp;#39;t know I I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="120.229" dur="4.441">you know what I hear is correct or not</text>
  <text start="121.909" dur="4.17">yeah i think the crossover is either</text>
  <text start="124.67" dur="3.69">going to happen late this year or early</text>
  <text start="126.079" dur="4.801">next year but there&amp;#39;s definitely more</text>
  <text start="128.36" dur="5.33">demand for e-books lately and i had a</text>
  <text start="130.88" dur="5.37">dream about a month ago where i was</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="4.21">publishing a lot more ebooks what do you</text>
  <text start="136.25" dur="4.59">think about the value of eBook</text>
  <text start="137.9" dur="5.27">publishing the way I look at it is when</text>
  <text start="140.84" dur="5.64">I&amp;#39;m writing a book I&amp;#39;m writing an e-book</text>
  <text start="143.17" dur="5.98">you know easily ninety-five percent of</text>
  <text start="146.48" dur="5.1">my my sales our ebooks as opposed to</text>
  <text start="149.15" dur="4.68">printed books but at the same time</text>
  <text start="151.58" dur="4.77">because I do print on demand like like</text>
  <text start="153.83" dur="5.37">create space the only way somebody can</text>
  <text start="156.35" dur="6.9">buy my print version of my books so far</text>
  <text start="159.2" dur="6.99">is if they&amp;#39;re on Amazon anyway so i</text>
  <text start="163.25" dur="5.13">right with the idea in mind that is</text>
  <text start="166.19" dur="4.29">basically an e-book well you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="168.38" dur="4.68">basically targeting the e-book reader</text>
  <text start="170.48" dur="4.47">from the get-go yeah mostly because like</text>
  <text start="173.06" dur="4.95">I said like the vast majority of my</text>
  <text start="174.95" dur="4.44">books are ebooks not the print books so</text>
  <text start="178.01" dur="3.75">that being said it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m keeping in</text>
  <text start="179.39" dur="4.92">mind the formatting issues at the way I</text>
  <text start="181.76" dur="4.56">write things is primarily going to be</text>
  <text start="184.31" dur="4.8">seen on someones you know kindle or</text>
  <text start="186.32" dur="5.4">their digital reader a phone app</text>
  <text start="189.11" dur="4.08">whatever the case may be if my book is</text>
  <text start="191.72" dur="4.17">like long enough it&amp;#39;s not just some</text>
  <text start="193.19" dur="5.519">bite-sized thing then I bet I do make a</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="5.7">print-on-demand version of it the way I</text>
  <text start="198.709" dur="6.121">read is predominantly kindle I go and I</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="5.07">buy it it&amp;#39;s on my Kindle in a moment not</text>
  <text start="204.83" dur="3">this you know wait a day or two for it</text>
  <text start="206.66" dur="3.93">to come in the mail and stuff anymore</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="5.52">but the reason I want to have printed</text>
  <text start="210.59" dur="5.46">books available is because if I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="213.35" dur="3.93">if I give a gift to somebody you know</text>
  <text start="216.05" dur="3.15">it&amp;#39;s like if I&amp;#39;m going to give someone a</text>
  <text start="217.28" dur="5.34">copy of my book I want to give them a</text>
  <text start="219.2" dur="5.31">tangible copy of the book you know I but</text>
  <text start="222.62" dur="4.47">as far as my reading habits go I pretty</text>
  <text start="224.51" dur="4.05">much read everything on my my kindle and</text>
  <text start="227.09" dur="3.63">someone says hey I bought you this book</text>
  <text start="228.56" dur="4.41">where can I stand it or whatever i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="230.72" dur="4.41">like so that means it&amp;#39;s gonna be a while</text>
  <text start="232.97" dur="4.29">before is that all right you know i mean</text>
  <text start="235.13" dur="3.78">like i can look at my calendar see where</text>
  <text start="237.26" dur="3.06">i&amp;#39;m going to be then or it&amp;#39;s like well</text>
  <text start="238.91" dur="3.27">you know what don&amp;#39;t send it to peru send</text>
  <text start="240.32" dur="3.03">it to Canada or I&amp;#39;ve got a friend in the</text>
  <text start="242.18" dur="3.66">States coming send it to this address</text>
  <text start="243.35" dur="4.5">and they&amp;#39;ll bring it with them you know</text>
  <text start="245.84" dur="4.77">so for me it just there&amp;#39;s so many ways</text>
  <text start="247.85" dur="6.06">kindle or digital is my my preference</text>
  <text start="250.61" dur="5.099">and both as a reader in as a writer what</text>
  <text start="253.91" dur="5.609">are the headaches and pitfalls and the</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="6.15">advantages of actually formatting a book</text>
  <text start="259.519" dur="4.371">for ebook publishing things you like</text>
  <text start="261.859" dur="5.191">things you don&amp;#39;t like about the process</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="5.38">well like I said I&amp;#39;ve formatted a lot of</text>
  <text start="267.05" dur="5.31">people&amp;#39;s books for them and one headache</text>
  <text start="269.27" dur="5.01">is when they have a specific font or a</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="4.98">layout or something in the print version</text>
  <text start="274.28" dur="5.31">and they want it to carry over into the</text>
  <text start="277.34" dur="4.59">kindle version and it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="279.59" dur="5.55">going to happen not only will the font</text>
  <text start="281.93" dur="3.54">not work but when when a reader uses</text>
  <text start="285.14" dur="2.88">there</text>
  <text start="285.47" dur="4.53">their smartphone or their tablet it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="288.02" dur="4.65">the font will automatically change to</text>
  <text start="290" dur="4.95">whatever the default font settings are</text>
  <text start="292.67" dur="5.4">on that person&amp;#39;s device so there&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="294.95" dur="5.67">of like I like and I hate I like it for</text>
  <text start="298.07" dur="5.16">myself that I don&amp;#39;t need to worry about</text>
  <text start="300.62" dur="3.93">certain formatting issues because kindle</text>
  <text start="303.23" dur="3.39">takes care of some of these things for</text>
  <text start="304.55" dur="4.5">you unless you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re doing a very</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="4.56">image based book then that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="309.05" dur="5.16">like you you really have to figure out</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="4.56">how you want it to work in kindle but</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="3.63">when I&amp;#39;m formatting books for other</text>
  <text start="315.74" dur="3.3">people that that&amp;#39;s a headache if they if</text>
  <text start="317.84" dur="5.22">they have a preference for how they</text>
  <text start="319.04" dur="5.55">wanted to turn out chapter headings and</text>
  <text start="323.06" dur="3.66">things like that that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fine you</text>
  <text start="324.59" dur="4.41">can kind of work around that I was</text>
  <text start="326.72" dur="5.73">reading a book recently and it&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="329" dur="5.55">image heavy book and it&amp;#39;s like you you</text>
  <text start="332.45" dur="4.26">get to the end of text and if the</text>
  <text start="334.55" dur="3.54">picture didn&amp;#39;t fit on your screen you</text>
  <text start="336.71" dur="3.24">have to kind of hit the swipe and go to</text>
  <text start="338.09" dur="3.75">the next page and then you see the</text>
  <text start="339.95" dur="4.86">picture and there&amp;#39;s so many ways that</text>
  <text start="341.84" dur="5.01">this particular book is just ugly in the</text>
  <text start="344.81" dur="3.48">kindle version you know no media but</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s the way i have to settle for it</text>
  <text start="348.29" dur="4.71">if i&amp;#39;m gonna read it and so so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.77" dur="2.46">that kind of stuff like depending on</text>
  <text start="353" dur="5.4">what kind of formatting you want to do</text>
  <text start="354.23" dur="5.85">is reading martin short&amp;#39;s biography came</text>
  <text start="358.4" dur="4.579">out around Christmas so it was something</text>
  <text start="360.08" dur="5.49">i read I mean I enjoyed it he&amp;#39;s from</text>
  <text start="362.979" dur="4.841">Hamilton which is like i was born in</text>
  <text start="365.57" dur="4.05">Brantford which is like the city over so</text>
  <text start="367.82" dur="3.39">there&amp;#39;s so many ways that like you know</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="3.72">oh he&amp;#39;s got a biography I want to read</text>
  <text start="371.21" dur="5.37">about this but he&amp;#39;s a famous Hollywood</text>
  <text start="373.34" dur="4.38">comedian now and I&amp;#39;m reading and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="376.58" dur="2.28">got all these pictures at the back I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="377.72" dur="2.34">like well that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s really how you</text>
  <text start="378.86" dur="2.79">should do it then you know instead of</text>
  <text start="380.06" dur="3.81">trying to insert pictures all the time</text>
  <text start="381.65" dur="3.99">in your text there there&amp;#39;s a whole bunch</text>
  <text start="383.87" dur="4.049">of them at the back with their captions</text>
  <text start="385.64" dur="4.44">and stuff so like on a kindle version I</text>
  <text start="387.919" dur="4.531">don&amp;#39;t know how he did it at the print</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="4.44">copy but the kindle version there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.45" dur="3.9">certain challenge is if you want your</text>
  <text start="394.52" dur="3.72">book to look a certain way you just</text>
  <text start="396.35" dur="3.6">can&amp;#39;t really if you&amp;#39;re just writing and</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="3.06">all you&amp;#39;re doing is communicating then</text>
  <text start="399.95" dur="2.82">that doesn&amp;#39;t matter you just you know</text>
  <text start="401.3" dur="3.36">get your point across and worry about</text>
  <text start="402.77" dur="3.959">that kind of stuff that was one of the</text>
  <text start="404.66" dur="5.04">things that I learned very quickly when</text>
  <text start="406.729" dur="5.401">I started taking my education and kindle</text>
  <text start="409.7" dur="5.19">publishing is that images do not</text>
  <text start="412.13" dur="5.099">translate really well to kindle box they</text>
  <text start="414.89" dur="4.33">just don&amp;#39;t essentially when you publish</text>
  <text start="417.229" dur="4.391">a kindle book your publishing a web page</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="5.58">and that&amp;#39;s how its formatted it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="421.62" dur="5.31">formatted as an HTML page and it does</text>
  <text start="424.8" dur="4.74">weird things with images and if you try</text>
  <text start="426.93" dur="4.59">to put in formatting and spacing and</text>
  <text start="429.54" dur="3.87">line breaks and paragraph breaks and all</text>
  <text start="431.52" dur="3.99">these other things which you can do very</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="5.1">easily in a print book they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="435.51" dur="6.69">difficult to pull off in an e-book I my</text>
  <text start="438.51" dur="6.21">Kindle cookbook my Peruvian cookbook we</text>
  <text start="442.2" dur="6.96">decided we want each recipe to have</text>
  <text start="444.72" dur="6.36">pictures but I made the book you know</text>
  <text start="449.16" dur="5.07">like I constantly was plugging in my</text>
  <text start="451.08" dur="5.19">Kindle by USB and going to the kindle to</text>
  <text start="454.23" dur="4.26">see how it worked see how it looked so</text>
  <text start="456.27" dur="3.96">having large pictures was useless but</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="3.87">having them in such a way where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="460.23" dur="4.2">small enough that the formatting is the</text>
  <text start="462.36" dur="4.35">big deal but yet you can look at the</text>
  <text start="464.43" dur="5.22">picture and get an idea of how to</text>
  <text start="466.71" dur="5.81">compare it to if you&amp;#39;re cooking the</text>
  <text start="469.65" dur="5.22">recipe I knew going in the challenges of</text>
  <text start="472.52" dur="3.94">pictures but the other reason I wanted</text>
  <text start="474.87" dur="4.23">pictures in my book is because a lot of</text>
  <text start="476.46" dur="4.98">like cookbooks that I&amp;#39;ve get on the</text>
  <text start="479.1" dur="4.77">Kindle don&amp;#39;t have pictures another</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="5.85">there&amp;#39;s another aspect about the file</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="5.46">that you upload to Amazon is um if you</text>
  <text start="487.29" dur="3.72">enroll it in kin k I don&amp;#39;t know if you</text>
  <text start="489.33" dur="5.04">realize this or you probably probably do</text>
  <text start="491.01" dur="7.26">but if you enroll it in KDP select right</text>
  <text start="494.37" dur="6.24">the larger your book file is Amazon</text>
  <text start="498.27" dur="3.81">starts to kind of talk a little bit you</text>
  <text start="500.61" dur="3.3">know you pay a few cents or whatever for</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="5.7">every download and so the large of the</text>
  <text start="503.91" dur="7.83">file is the more money you lose and so I</text>
  <text start="507.78" dur="5.939">get why a lot of cookbook authors don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="511.74" dur="4.109">or haven&amp;#39;t put a lot of pictures or any</text>
  <text start="513.719" dur="5.07">pictures in their books because then it</text>
  <text start="515.849" dur="4.651">becomes so large of a file that is not</text>
  <text start="518.789" dur="4.471">worth it to do that especially if you</text>
  <text start="520.5" dur="4.92">enroll in KDP select and they dock off</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="4.35">you know a part of your earnings for how</text>
  <text start="525.42" dur="3.87">large the file is so I mean I would have</text>
  <text start="527.61" dur="5.19">to shrink on my files so that they were</text>
  <text start="529.29" dur="5.49">tiny but yet still visible and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="532.8" dur="4.38">like it&amp;#39;s a long cookbook it&amp;#39;s got 40</text>
  <text start="534.78" dur="3.69">recipes in it but making that was a bit</text>
  <text start="537.18" dur="3.36">of a headache and they don&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="538.47" dur="4.44">amazing on your kindle or on your tablet</text>
  <text start="540.54" dur="4.62">but at least it was like I made it</text>
  <text start="542.91" dur="5.34">knowing ahead of time how it looks now</text>
  <text start="545.16" dur="4.86">it turns out in kindle you know i&amp;#39;ll bet</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="4.31">you learned a lot about formatting in</text>
  <text start="550.02" dur="2.54">the process</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="5.07">quite the education yeah I knew that</text>
  <text start="555.12" dur="4.68">Kendall took off some of your royalties</text>
  <text start="557.67" dur="3.899">based on the size of your data file I</text>
  <text start="559.8" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t know that it was just for the</text>
  <text start="561.569" dur="4.71">unlimited that&amp;#39;s interesting because my</text>
  <text start="564.12" dur="5.01">book that i have on economic collapse</text>
  <text start="566.279" dur="6.451">has a bunch of charts in it not a lot a</text>

  <text start="718.239" dur="6.121">and when you start to think about being</text>
  <text start="721.819" dur="4.92">an actual professional writer who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="724.36" dur="5.56">trying to maybe run a business oh</text>
  <text start="726.739" dur="5.611">because that&amp;#39;s how I you know a lot of</text>

  <text start="739.339" dur="6.3">just both for me I mean I realized that</text>
  <text start="743.269" dur="5.85">it because it&amp;#39;s a spiritual production</text>
  <text start="745.639" dur="7.081">it is a ministry you know in a size but</text>
  <text start="749.119" dur="7.53">we don&amp;#39;t my wife and I don&amp;#39;t run it as a</text>
  <text start="752.72" dur="6">non-profit so we don&amp;#39;t have a 501c3 we</text>
  <text start="756.649" dur="5.4">have an LLC we have a business license</text>
  <text start="758.72" dur="6.029">we pay taxes and we run it as a</text>
  <text start="762.049" dur="4.111">traditional business so because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="764.749" dur="4.471">looking at things from that perspective</text>
  <text start="766.16" dur="4.709">I realize it as a business person there</text>
  <text start="769.22" dur="3.63">are just certain tools that you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="770.869" dur="5.13">to have to have if you&amp;#39;re going to run a</text>
  <text start="772.85" dur="4.829">business successfully and it was kind of</text>
  <text start="775.999" dur="3.9">funny because we got a tax professional</text>
  <text start="777.679" dur="5.46">who has been helping us do our business</text>
  <text start="779.899" dur="5.88">taxes and we came to him at the end of</text>
  <text start="783.139" dur="4.05">the year the taxpayer this year showed</text>
  <text start="785.779" dur="2.66">him all of our information he goes out</text>
  <text start="787.189" dur="6.541">you actually made some money this year</text>
  <text start="788.439" dur="6.94">good we said was unusual he goes oh yeah</text>
  <text start="793.73" dur="2.639">he goes it&amp;#39;s very unusual he said</text>
  <text start="795.379" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people and have these</text>
  <text start="796.369" dur="3.87">you know an LLC and they technically</text>
  <text start="798.919" dur="3.241">have a business but none of them make</text>
  <text start="800.239" dur="3.121">any money right because you guys</text>
  <text start="802.16" dur="2.609">actually made some money so you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="803.36" dur="3.719">have to pay in some taxes here we</text>
  <text start="804.769" dur="4.591">actually ended up paying a lot more</text>
  <text start="807.079" dur="4.021">taxes and we anticipated because we had</text>
  <text start="809.36" dur="4.589">made actually made some revenue last</text>
  <text start="811.1" dur="4.26">year right and that&amp;#39;s one of the things</text>
  <text start="813.949" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s been difficult for me because</text>
  <text start="815.36" dur="4.89">I&amp;#39;ve never wanted to run my own business</text>
  <text start="817.639" dur="5.031">I never wanted to have I never wanted to</text>
  <text start="820.25" dur="4.17">book I never saw myself as a writer</text>
  <text start="822.67" dur="4.06">certainly didn&amp;#39;t want to be</text>
  <text start="824.42" dur="3.99">self-employed I had always envisioned</text>
  <text start="826.73" dur="4.44">myself working for somebody else letting</text>
  <text start="828.41" dur="5.34">them collect the money pay the taxes</text>
  <text start="831.17" dur="4.14">here&amp;#39;s your paycheck in our 30 weeks I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="833.75" dur="4.74">always kind of see myself as that type</text>
  <text start="835.31" dur="6">of person but my wife has encouraged me</text>
  <text start="838.49" dur="4.68">to step out of that mindset and into</text>
  <text start="841.31" dur="3.78">more of an entrepreneurial business</text>
  <text start="843.17" dur="3.9">person mindset which is difficult</text>
  <text start="845.09" dur="4.86">because that&amp;#39;s not who I&amp;#39;ve always been</text>
  <text start="847.07" dur="5.28">so I&amp;#39;m learning and picking up tools</text>
  <text start="849.95" dur="4.05">like Scribner is part of the process one</text>
  <text start="852.35" dur="3.9">of the things that I ran across with</text>
  <text start="854" dur="5.01">publishing ebooks is we had purchased</text>
  <text start="856.25" dur="4.5">some software that we use to publish our</text>
  <text start="859.01" dur="4.14">first two books as ebooks and it worked</text>
  <text start="860.75" dur="4.29">great but when I went to publish my last</text>
  <text start="863.15" dur="4.5">book seeing in the spirit it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="865.04" dur="5.79">work we could not get the formatting it</text>
  <text start="867.65" dur="5.36">would export a zip file we would upload</text>
  <text start="870.83" dur="5.73">it to Kindle and it would say</text>
  <text start="873.01" dur="5.83">unrecognized file format so we had to</text>
  <text start="876.56" dur="5.52">find some other way to export an e-book</text>
  <text start="878.84" dur="7.17">and I ended up using the smashwords</text>
  <text start="882.08" dur="7.259">process okay which is such a headache if</text>
  <text start="886.01" dur="5.37">to create an art a rich text file strip</text>
  <text start="889.339" dur="3.901">out all the formatting create a</text>
  <text start="891.38" dur="3.3">bare-bones document and then put the</text>
  <text start="893.24" dur="4.23">formatting back in just minimal</text>
  <text start="894.68" dur="4.59">formatting which creates a pretty good</text>
  <text start="897.47" dur="3.72">ebook but it&amp;#39;s a long process because</text>
  <text start="899.27" dur="3.69">you have to go back and put in italics</text>
  <text start="901.19" dur="3.78">and bold and bullets and everything else</text>
  <text start="902.96" dur="3.93">manually into the document well then</text>
  <text start="904.97" dur="6.06">i&amp;#39;ll definitely not be using smashwords</text>
  <text start="906.89" dur="6.78">ever oh gosh but you know you know gates</text>
  <text start="911.03" dur="5.43">it creates a really good looking ebook</text>
  <text start="913.67" dur="5.22">that flows well on a multitude of</text>
  <text start="916.46" dur="4.59">different formats but it is it is kind</text>
  <text start="918.89" dur="4.65">of a headache to do it because you like</text>
  <text start="921.05" dur="5.789">I took my document that I got back from</text>
  <text start="923.54" dur="6.06">Lydia a word document and then I had to</text>
  <text start="926.839" dur="5.791">remove all of the formatting but Dutch</text>
  <text start="929.6" dur="6.9">doesn&amp;#39;t smashwords accept epub files</text>
  <text start="932.63" dur="6.3">they do because then in Scrivener you</text>
  <text start="936.5" dur="4.65">can write and export as an epub and send</text>
  <text start="938.93" dur="4.32">that to them I would assume right but</text>
  <text start="941.15" dur="3.66">before I had Scrivener right you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="943.25" dur="4.32">know it yet I was still hammering away</text>
  <text start="944.81" dur="4.2">with my chisel in my rock I have to get</text>
  <text start="947.57" dur="3.33">things done the old fashioned now you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="949.01" dur="5.03">got the jackhammer now I&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="950.9" dur="5.689">jackhammer I stand a book baby</text>
  <text start="954.04" dur="5.34">calm since I&amp;#39;ve since deciding on</text>
  <text start="956.589" dur="4.981">putting my books into other places</text>
  <text start="959.38" dur="5.399">besides amazon they charge twenty</text>
  <text start="961.57" dur="5.04">dollars a book and then it&amp;#39;d take like</text>
  <text start="964.779" dur="4.531">ten or fifteen percent of your your</text>
  <text start="966.61" dur="4.14">profit which is you know economically</text>
  <text start="969.31" dur="4.589">that&amp;#39;s how I needed to do it instead of</text>
  <text start="970.75" dur="8.16">the 300 or whatever dollar packages they</text>
  <text start="973.899" dur="10.021">had so they take epub but what made life</text>
  <text start="978.91" dur="8.159">difficult for me is you can&amp;#39;t put links</text>
  <text start="983.92" dur="5.669">to like compete competing locations so</text>
  <text start="987.069" dur="4.89">like so typically my no affiliate links</text>
  <text start="989.589" dur="4.5">not that I have very many of them but I</text>
  <text start="991.959" dur="3.57">couldn&amp;#39;t like if I say like I&amp;#39;m also the</text>
  <text start="994.089" dur="3.721">author of this book this book in this</text>
  <text start="995.529" dur="4.711">book and they have like amazon links</text>
  <text start="997.81" dur="4.139">well then they were they if you submit</text>
  <text start="1000.24" dur="3.48">it to like a website like that i don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1001.949" dur="5.19">know how smashwords is there the same</text>
  <text start="1003.72" dur="6.51">way no links so you basically it has to</text>
  <text start="1007.139" dur="6.031">be the bare-bones thing right and I</text>
  <text start="1010.23" dur="5.969">don&amp;#39;t sell a buttload of copies outside</text>
  <text start="1013.17" dur="5.01">of Amazon like I sell more digital</text>
  <text start="1016.199" dur="5.76">versions of my books in the other stores</text>
  <text start="1018.18" dur="5.749">than I do print even but for the most</text>
  <text start="1021.959" dur="4.651">part amazon is where they&amp;#39;re selling and</text>
  <text start="1023.929" dur="5.341">you know I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed scrivener for this</text>
  <text start="1026.61" dur="4.62">reason where I can export the epub and</text>
  <text start="1029.27" dur="4.51">you know that I&amp;#39;m saying it for the</text>
  <text start="1031.23" dur="5.689">listeners mobi is pretty much amazon and</text>
  <text start="1033.78" dur="6.149">then epub is like any and everybody else</text>
  <text start="1036.919" dur="4.75">so you kind of torn because so long as</text>
  <text start="1039.929" dur="3.9">you can make it look in epub and i think</text>
  <text start="1041.669" dur="4.801">i think it&amp;#39;s an accepted format if you</text>
  <text start="1043.829" dur="5.401">upload an epub to amazon though yeah</text>
  <text start="1046.47" dur="4.74">they convert it to a movie file yep but</text>
  <text start="1049.23" dur="3.329">it doesn&amp;#39;t end tear up a lot of your</text>
  <text start="1051.21" dur="4.11">formatting or anything like that if you</text>
  <text start="1052.559" dur="4.051">go from epub to mobi in that process but</text>
  <text start="1055.32" dur="3.359">it&amp;#39;s you know you still have to double</text>
  <text start="1056.61" dur="4.68">check but you know again like that&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="1058.679" dur="4.471">you know not to be you know Scrivener</text>
  <text start="1061.29" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;ve got a link on my site and yeah I</text>
  <text start="1063.15" dur="3.81">get a small Commission if he if you buy</text>
  <text start="1064.89" dur="4.409">it from my link and stuff but like</text>
  <text start="1066.96" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s not why I&amp;#39;m extolling them you</text>
  <text start="1069.299" dur="4.26">know it&amp;#39;s like I just as a writer and</text>
  <text start="1071.01" dur="4.169">how I use it and you know and I think of</text>
  <text start="1073.559" dur="4.831">the process for uploading my first book</text>
  <text start="1075.179" dur="5.641">at amazon and you know undoubtedly the</text>
  <text start="1078.39" dur="4.08">first time you do something is you know</text>
  <text start="1080.82" dur="3.89">it takes you longer than it will</text>
  <text start="1082.47" dur="4.949">afterwards I think of all the ways</text>
  <text start="1084.71" dur="3.14">Scrivener and exporting how that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="1087.419" dur="2.651">of</text>
  <text start="1087.85" dur="4.8">green lined a lot of the process for me</text>
  <text start="1090.07" dur="5.4">with it just eliminates a few steps in</text>
  <text start="1092.65" dur="6.659">the process so I&amp;#39;m not uploading a word</text>
  <text start="1095.47" dur="6.06">document to Amazon and then seeing if it</text>
  <text start="1099.309" dur="4.74">worked because even if you go to these</text>
  <text start="1101.53" dur="4.649">websites and they have for example like</text>
  <text start="1104.049" dur="4.651">Amazon and you&amp;#39;re logging in and you</text>
  <text start="1106.179" dur="5.61">upload your file you still don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1108.7" dur="5.729">see how the book truly looks on your</text>
  <text start="1111.789" dur="4.741">device when you&amp;#39;re using their they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1114.429" dur="3.931">fake reader there on the page you know I</text>
  <text start="1116.53" dur="4.019">mean it might look a certain way on that</text>
  <text start="1118.36" dur="4.59">but it&amp;#39;s still not even really giving</text>
  <text start="1120.549" dur="4.291">you the hundred percent idea until you</text>
  <text start="1122.95" dur="3.839">you know I don&amp;#39;t know about you but I</text>
  <text start="1124.84" dur="3.839">don&amp;#39;t buy my own books you know just so</text>
  <text start="1126.789" dur="4.051">I can see them you know that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1128.679" dur="4.291">make in the mopey file works you know</text>
  <text start="1130.84" dur="3.87">there&amp;#39;s so many wait like if if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1132.97" dur="5.579">like me and you have a kindle device</text>
  <text start="1134.71" dur="6.959">then you can write in Scrivener hook up</text>
  <text start="1138.549" dur="5.221">your USB to your computer and then save</text>
  <text start="1141.669" dur="3.691">your file to your kindle and then double</text>
  <text start="1143.77" dur="3.45">check and make sure it&amp;#39;s how you want it</text>
  <text start="1145.36" dur="3.51">to look you know I&amp;#39;ve got a kindle fire</text>

  <text start="1286" dur="5.1">they&amp;#39;re now publishing one of your books</text>
  <text start="1288.3" dur="5.17">right have you signed a contract with</text>
  <text start="1291.1" dur="7.23">them is it&amp;#39;s just a one-book deal what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1293.47" dur="7.35">your situation with destiny right well</text>
  <text start="1298.33" dur="5.19">one thing that the contract did say is</text>
  <text start="1300.82" dur="5.609">that i&amp;#39;m not supposed to like divulge</text>
  <text start="1303.52" dur="5.34">details of it don&amp;#39;t but i&amp;#39;m sorry it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1306.429" dur="5.521">okay so so it&amp;#39;s like a five-page</text>
  <text start="1308.86" dur="6.83">contracts and it&amp;#39;s pretty standard and</text>
  <text start="1311.95" dur="7.35">it is a multi book deal I show them it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1315.69" dur="7.48">called no right of right of first</text>
  <text start="1319.3" dur="6.509">refusal so long as something I write is</text>
  <text start="1323.17" dur="4.95">more than 40,000 words I have to show it</text>
  <text start="1325.809" dur="3.661">to them and you know they can say now we</text>
  <text start="1328.12" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t want that we don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1329.47" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;ll sell and I have to do that with my</text>
  <text start="1331.3" dur="5.7">next three book it&amp;#39;s interesting because</text>
  <text start="1334.21" dur="5.67">I talked to you early in the process</text>
  <text start="1337" dur="4.89">when they approached my friend Brad</text>
  <text start="1339.88" dur="5.79">Herman I think you&amp;#39;re acquainted with</text>
  <text start="1341.89" dur="5.669">him too I suppose he he reached out to</text>
  <text start="1345.67" dur="5.04">me saying I now I now work for destiny</text>
  <text start="1347.559" dur="4.86">image and I knew him from a mutual</text>
  <text start="1350.71" dur="2.86">friend who got me in touch with him on</text>
  <text start="1352.419" dur="3.881">facebook</text>
  <text start="1353.57" dur="4.89">and I knew from talking to before that</text>
  <text start="1356.3" dur="4.41">he he owns a bookstore and you know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1358.46" dur="3.78">well versed in the stuff and had it had</text>
  <text start="1360.71" dur="3.15">encouraged me about my tongue&amp;#39;s book</text>
  <text start="1362.24" dur="4.23">that it was something he thought could</text>
  <text start="1363.86" dur="4.8">sell well and and so he he writes me a</text>
  <text start="1366.47" dur="4.29">message saying he showed it to his boss</text>
  <text start="1368.66" dur="4.14">in his department or whatever like</text>
  <text start="1370.76" dur="5.37">acquisitions he works for the</text>
  <text start="1372.8" dur="5.64">acquisitions and he said his boss liked</text>
  <text start="1376.13" dur="4.92">it and to you know reach out to me and</text>
  <text start="1378.44" dur="6.45">and I said no without even thinking</text>
  <text start="1381.05" dur="7.05">about it because destiny image is well</text>
  <text start="1384.89" dur="6.03">known over the years for making the</text>
  <text start="1388.1" dur="4.59">author pay for half of the cost right so</text>
  <text start="1390.92" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s kind is kind of like a you know a</text>
  <text start="1392.69" dur="5.67">mix of vanity and traditional publisher</text>
  <text start="1396.5" dur="3.9">like the author pays half the cost and</text>
  <text start="1398.36" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;m like I you know we&amp;#39;re barely getting</text>
  <text start="1400.4" dur="4.38">by as it is with books and support and</text>
  <text start="1402.74" dur="3.6">stuff we can&amp;#39;t afford to pay like</text>
  <text start="1404.78" dur="4.02">fifteen thousand dollars to print</text>
  <text start="1406.34" dur="4.23">thousands of books and I and I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1408.8" dur="4.32">like a you know wasn&amp;#39;t a false sense of</text>
  <text start="1410.57" dur="5.34">humility but it was like I&amp;#39;m not big</text>
  <text start="1413.12" dur="5.67">enough that&amp;#39;s the reality of where your</text>
  <text start="1415.91" dur="4.77">what your situation is exactly like I</text>
  <text start="1418.79" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t know very many authors who could</text>
  <text start="1420.68" dur="4.98">plunk down 12 to 15 grand to have their</text>
  <text start="1422.99" dur="4.89">first book published right and so I said</text>
  <text start="1425.66" dur="3.57">I said no right away I didn&amp;#39;t even pray</text>
  <text start="1427.88" dur="5.79">about I didn&amp;#39;t even think about it I</text>
  <text start="1429.23" dur="7.44">just said hey Lily a publisher made it</text>
  <text start="1433.67" dur="4.71">but I had to say no I made it no but</text>
  <text start="1436.67" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s like on the one hand it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1438.38" dur="4.92">validating like a publisher okay like</text>
  <text start="1441.17" dur="3.75">for the listeners benefit if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1443.3" dur="4.2">already know something like this at a</text>
  <text start="1444.92" dur="4.65">typical publisher get thousands of</text>
  <text start="1447.5" dur="4.71">manuscripts you know every so many</text>
  <text start="1449.57" dur="7.2">months and only will publish like less</text>
  <text start="1452.21" dur="7.65">than five of them and so this idea that</text>
  <text start="1456.77" dur="5.82">someone was saying hey your book is is</text>
  <text start="1459.86" dur="4.92">of such a quality wheat we think we want</text>
  <text start="1462.59" dur="4.44">it you know and we think it can make</text>
  <text start="1464.78" dur="3.72">both of us money you know that was</text>
  <text start="1467.03" dur="3.33">validating but i&amp;#39;m like i can&amp;#39;t i can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1468.5" dur="3.9">go down this path where i know you guys</text>
  <text start="1470.36" dur="3.51">want me to pay have it and so Brian</text>
  <text start="1472.4" dur="4.08">wrote me back and said no we don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="1473.87" dur="5.91">that anymore it&amp;#39;s like okay well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1476.48" dur="4.98">listening then look you were one of the</text>
  <text start="1479.78" dur="3.26">people I reached out to because when i</text>
  <text start="1481.46" dur="5.32">was talking to Brad he told me they had</text>
  <text start="1483.04" dur="7.07">contacted you and you said no you know</text>
  <text start="1486.78" dur="5.82">and so I wanted to say no I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1490.11" dur="5.94">selling the volume of copies that you</text>
  <text start="1492.6" dur="5.72">are so it is true that with traditional</text>
  <text start="1496.05" dur="4.47">publishing you get a much smaller</text>
  <text start="1498.32" dur="4.69">royalty than you do when your self</text>
  <text start="1500.52" dur="5.16">publishing you know like Amazon you get</text>
  <text start="1503.01" dur="4.49">seventy percent of what you sell and you</text>
  <text start="1505.68" dur="4.56">know a traditional for an e-book</text>
  <text start="1507.5" dur="5.86">Amazon&amp;#39;s print royalty is thirty-five</text>
  <text start="1510.24" dur="4.8">percent right it&amp;#39;s always like that and</text>
  <text start="1513.36" dur="4.86">so the traditional publisher could be</text>
  <text start="1515.04" dur="4.56">anywhere between 10 15 depending on the</text>
  <text start="1518.22" dur="4.23">company depending on the contract you</text>
  <text start="1519.6" dur="5.58">sign but it&amp;#39;s smaller that&amp;#39;s the point</text>
  <text start="1522.45" dur="4.98">is smaller so there was a lot of pros</text>
  <text start="1525.18" dur="4.59">and cons and I didn&amp;#39;t really make a</text>
  <text start="1527.43" dur="5.91">decision or sign a contract until I</text>
  <text start="1529.77" dur="5.16">think it was februari or march um he</text>
  <text start="1533.34" dur="4.08">took it like Brad told me around</text>
  <text start="1534.93" dur="4.65">December okay you know it went through</text>
  <text start="1537.42" dur="4.11">all their channels and and so here that</text>
  <text start="1539.58" dur="4.17">we&amp;#39;re gonna send you a contract and then</text>
  <text start="1541.53" dur="6.72">I never heard anything ever again for</text>
  <text start="1543.75" dur="6.39">like 25 so I assumed it must not be</text>
  <text start="1548.25" dur="3.51">happening then and then when he did get</text>
  <text start="1550.14" dur="4.38">back back in touch with me yeah there</text>
  <text start="1551.76" dur="4.59">was a contract sent to me but by that</text>
  <text start="1554.52" dur="4.47">time I you know talked to a lot of</text>
  <text start="1556.35" dur="4.95">people and there&amp;#39;s pros and cons you</text>
  <text start="1558.99" dur="4.29">know as you know and you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1561.3" dur="5.28">free to jump in with with other other</text>
  <text start="1563.28" dur="5.64">cons or prose but like for example like</text>
  <text start="1566.58" dur="4.8">I I know what you told me when we were</text>
  <text start="1568.92" dur="6.09">chatting but like why why did you say no</text>
  <text start="1571.38" dur="8.1">for example well I am in a very unique</text>
  <text start="1575.01" dur="6.84">situation and I am strongly biased and I</text>
  <text start="1579.48" dur="5.52">feel that there&amp;#39;s a trend in publishing</text>
  <text start="1581.85" dur="5.25">that I am really championing I wished</text>
  <text start="1585" dur="4.89">that more authors would seriously</text>
  <text start="1587.1" dur="5.04">consider taking self publishing as a</text>
  <text start="1589.89" dur="4.38">good way to go most authors have</text>
  <text start="1592.14" dur="3.66">traditionally felt like they&amp;#39;re only</text>
  <text start="1594.27" dur="3.51">validation in the world comes from</text>
  <text start="1595.8" dur="4.32">having a publisher accept their</text>
  <text start="1597.78" dur="3.6">manuscript you know often the contract</text>
  <text start="1600.12" dur="4.26">and then they feel like they&amp;#39;ve made it</text>
  <text start="1601.38" dur="5.16">and I think that is a very old world</text>
  <text start="1604.38" dur="5.01">view of looking at publishing and and</text>
  <text start="1606.54" dur="5.4">writing I think that the game has</text>
  <text start="1609.39" dur="5.4">changed so dramatically in the last 15</text>
  <text start="1611.94" dur="6.06">years I really think traditional</text>
  <text start="1614.79" dur="5.16">publishers and vanity publishers are on</text>
  <text start="1618" dur="2.64">the ropes I think they&amp;#39;re a little bit</text>
  <text start="1619.95" dur="2.1">desperate to</text>
  <text start="1620.64" dur="5.45">to get authors and I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1622.05" dur="5.91">willing to I think they have to make the</text>
  <text start="1626.09" dur="3.49">enticements to come over and sign a</text>
  <text start="1627.96" dur="3.24">little bit sweeter because they know</text>
  <text start="1629.58" dur="3.93">that self-publishing is a lot easier</text>
  <text start="1631.2" dur="5.67">than it used to be right twenty years</text>
  <text start="1633.51" dur="7.35">ago nobody self-published right and I</text>
  <text start="1636.87" dur="6.42">agree I agree with you mostly like for</text>
  <text start="1640.86" dur="4.95">me my that I&amp;#39;m kind of joking about the</text>
  <text start="1643.29" dur="5.04">validation I have friends who they have</text>
  <text start="1645.81" dur="5.19">books and they have novels and they are</text>
  <text start="1648.33" dur="4.98">desperately waiting for a publisher to</text>
  <text start="1651" dur="3.69">come along and accept their manuscript</text>
  <text start="1653.31" dur="3.63">because they just believe that is the</text>
  <text start="1654.69" dur="4.11">validation that they&amp;#39;re looking for and</text>
  <text start="1656.94" dur="3.36">I think well I respect that because</text>
  <text start="1658.8" dur="3.84">that&amp;#39;s how things are traditionally been</text>
  <text start="1660.3" dur="5.13">if you want to be a serious writer I</text>
  <text start="1662.64" dur="4.95">think that that is a waste of time to</text>
  <text start="1665.43" dur="5.91">hold on for that right and I agree with</text>
  <text start="1667.59" dur="6.39">you about waiting and waiting for it to</text>
  <text start="1671.34" dur="5.97">happen because like like you know I i</text>
  <text start="1673.98" dur="4.77">self-published and I mean I can answer</text>
  <text start="1677.31" dur="4.35">and explain the reasons I decided to</text>
  <text start="1678.75" dur="5.16">sign the contract um but one you know</text>
  <text start="1681.66" dur="4.71">like a SJ he&amp;#39;ll he&amp;#39;s a published author</text>
  <text start="1683.91" dur="5.22">he you know he said to me you know what</text>
  <text start="1686.37" dur="5.46">Steve if I were you I would just give it</text>
  <text start="1689.13" dur="5.19">to them because you&amp;#39;re like 33 and</text>
  <text start="1691.83" dur="5.28">you&amp;#39;ve written something that a</text>
  <text start="1694.32" dur="6.42">publisher wants they must see a reason</text>
  <text start="1697.11" dur="6.51">like why they want this book and I know</text>
  <text start="1700.74" dur="4.65">other guys who are like in their 50 60 s</text>
  <text start="1703.62" dur="4.5">and they&amp;#39;ve shopped around their</text>

  <text start="1708.12" dur="3.21">nobody wants it and then here you are</text>
  <text start="1710.04" dur="5.91">they&amp;#39;re just coming to you and they want</text>
  <text start="1711.33" dur="6">it don&amp;#39;t be stupid and I&amp;#39;m like but you</text>
  <text start="1715.95" dur="3.39">sign over your rights that&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1717.33" dur="4.38">ethicon or a pro depending on how you</text>
  <text start="1719.34" dur="3.93">look at it but it&amp;#39;s kind of a con you</text>
  <text start="1721.71" dur="3.36">sign over your rights to the book and it</text>
  <text start="1723.27" dur="4.59">belongs to the publisher it&amp;#39;s not yours</text>
  <text start="1725.07" dur="7.08">anymore and I&amp;#39;m like this was that book</text>
  <text start="1727.86" dur="6.63">that was ready to burst out of me so do</text>
  <text start="1732.15" dur="4.17">I want to hand this over and and you</text>
  <text start="1734.49" dur="3.87">know I had other people they&amp;#39;re like no</text>
  <text start="1736.32" dur="4.95">don&amp;#39;t do it it was your baby you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1738.36" dur="5.4">talking about here exactly and I</text>
  <text start="1741.27" dur="5.52">ultimately went with the idea that this</text>
  <text start="1743.76" dur="5.82">can be a door opener and the contract</text>
  <text start="1746.79" dur="4.56">stipulates my so like I can&amp;#39;t self</text>
  <text start="1749.58" dur="4.83">publish a book that&amp;#39;s more than 40,000</text>
  <text start="1751.35" dur="4.59">words but I can keep on self publishing</text>
  <text start="1754.41" dur="4.71">without giving them first right of</text>
  <text start="1755.94" dur="5.76">refusal exactly so it&amp;#39;s kind of like and</text>
  <text start="1759.12" dur="5.16">then other things I asked for in the</text>
  <text start="1761.7" dur="5.31">contract they gave me without arguing</text>
  <text start="1764.28" dur="5.1">and um so think things like with the</text>
  <text start="1767.01" dur="4.62">audiobook things like translating it</text>
  <text start="1769.38" dur="4.2">into Spanish things that were imported</text>
  <text start="1771.63" dur="3.66">like if I&amp;#39;m signing this over because</text>
  <text start="1773.58" dur="3">you know what I guess Jay told me he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1775.29" dur="3.75">you know he&amp;#39;s even he&amp;#39;s been published</text>
  <text start="1776.58" dur="5.28">with other author other publishers is um</text>
  <text start="1779.04" dur="4.08">you know there&amp;#39;s a book of his the</text>
  <text start="1781.86" dur="5.58">publishing company went out of business</text>
  <text start="1783.12" dur="6.9">and then the one that acquired it isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1787.44" dur="6.45">printing it anymore and so he was like</text>
  <text start="1790.02" dur="6.12">make sure to LIKE negotiate that if they</text>
  <text start="1793.89" dur="4.62">stop selling the book or printing it</text>
  <text start="1796.14" dur="5.01">that it somehow reverts the rights</text>
  <text start="1798.51" dur="6.03">revert back to you so like I had people</text>
  <text start="1801.15" dur="5.43">like him and dr. Crosby other people who</text>
  <text start="1804.54" dur="4.59">were season two authors self and</text>
  <text start="1806.58" dur="4.38">traditionally published and you know I</text>
  <text start="1809.13" dur="4.26">was getting like 5050 good and bad</text>
  <text start="1810.96" dur="4.26">advice and the bad advice was things</text>
  <text start="1813.39" dur="3.39">like you know Steve don&amp;#39;t take this the</text>
  <text start="1815.22" dur="4.86">wrong way but you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re kind of a</text>
  <text start="1816.78" dur="6.36">nobody author and so you&amp;#39;ll go into debt</text>
  <text start="1820.08" dur="5.16">unnecessarily and have boxes of your</text>
  <text start="1823.14" dur="4.83">book in your basement in the next 20</text>
  <text start="1825.24" dur="6.35">years and an open one author I talk to</text>
  <text start="1827.97" dur="7.8">published with him in 1999 and is a</text>
  <text start="1831.59" dur="6.85">decently known author and in or an</text>
  <text start="1835.77" dur="4.32">international speaker and he told me you</text>
  <text start="1838.44" dur="3.78">know Steve I still to this day have</text>
  <text start="1840.09" dur="4.38">about a thousand copies left we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1842.22" dur="4.71">talking about may may not be the same</text>
  <text start="1844.47" dur="4.17">guy but that is a risk if you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1846.93" dur="3.93">with a vanity publisher and they say</text>
  <text start="1848.64" dur="4.23">look we&amp;#39;re gonna require you to buy 12</text>
  <text start="1850.86" dur="4.32">or 15 thousand dollars worth of books</text>
  <text start="1852.87" dur="4.95">upfront said no but then he told me</text>
  <text start="1855.18" dur="6.03">there&amp;#39;s no minimum purchase required but</text>
  <text start="1857.82" dur="7.38">I only get like sixty percent off or</text>
  <text start="1861.21" dur="5.54">something for the copies that i buy like</text>
  <text start="1865.2" dur="4.83">I forget what it is but I get a discount</text>
  <text start="1866.75" dur="5.5">but there&amp;#39;s no minimum copies you know</text>
  <text start="1870.03" dur="3.51">that no minimum amount required I mean</text>
  <text start="1872.25" dur="2.88">there&amp;#39;s so many details i don&amp;#39;t i don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1873.54" dur="3.75">know that i&amp;#39;m allowed to talk about</text>
  <text start="1875.13" dur="3.51">asking i don&amp;#39;t want you to die like yeah</text>
  <text start="1877.29" dur="3.21">i don&amp;#39;t want you to violate the terms of</text>
  <text start="1878.64" dur="5.16">the contract by talking about it but i</text>
  <text start="1880.5" dur="4.98">was unpleasantly surprised because of</text>
  <text start="1883.8" dur="3.63">all the horror stories other people told</text>
  <text start="1885.48" dur="3.72">me of what happened to them when they</text>
  <text start="1887.43" dur="4.56">a you know not with destiny image but</text>
  <text start="1889.2" dur="4.89">like with in general publishing losing</text>
  <text start="1891.99" dur="3.42">the rights to their books you know and</text>
  <text start="1894.09" dur="3.69">then they can&amp;#39;t get the book published</text>
  <text start="1895.41" dur="4.41">anymore and you know I showed the</text>
  <text start="1897.78" dur="5.16">contract to a few people before I signed</text>
  <text start="1899.82" dur="4.62">it and everybody was like wow I wish you</text>
  <text start="1902.94" dur="4.62">know when I signed something it was like</text>
  <text start="1904.44" dur="5.19">this or so like you know there&amp;#39;s pros</text>
  <text start="1907.56" dur="4.38">and cons and remember talking to jeremy</text>
  <text start="1909.63" dur="4.95">about this and you know the con is the</text>
  <text start="1911.94" dur="5.01">royalty there&amp;#39;s cons like when you go</text>
  <text start="1914.58" dur="5.01">traditional publishing you make less per</text>
  <text start="1916.95" dur="4.29">copy but the same time like i told you</text>
  <text start="1919.59" dur="2.88">nobody&amp;#39;s buying the print version of</text>
  <text start="1921.24" dur="3.33">this yeah it&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="1922.47" dur="4.38">every thousand dollars a month off of</text>
  <text start="1924.57" dur="4.11">royalties so what are you really losing</text>
  <text start="1926.85" dur="4.8">if you don&amp;#39;t got smaller cut in</text>
  <text start="1928.68" dur="5.82">royalties right and and and even if it</text>
  <text start="1931.65" dur="4.44">sells modestly III don&amp;#39;t know that they</text>
  <text start="1934.5" dur="4.08">print like a thousand copies anymore I</text>
  <text start="1936.09" dur="4.59">think they I think but I don&amp;#39;t know they</text>
  <text start="1938.58" dur="4.95">do a print on demand type of business</text>
  <text start="1940.68" dur="5.07">model but say that they they put it in a</text>
  <text start="1943.53" dur="4.5">bunch of bookstores then that&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="1945.75" dur="3.72">gained compared to how it does now</text>
  <text start="1948.03" dur="3">because the only place people can buy</text>
  <text start="1949.47" dur="4.29">the print version of my book is on</text>
  <text start="1951.03" dur="4.83">Amazon it is through create space right</text>
  <text start="1953.76" dur="5.07">right so even if it&amp;#39;s like kind of a</text>
  <text start="1955.86" dur="5.46">flop or whatever it&amp;#39;s more successful</text>
  <text start="1958.83" dur="5.01">than I am right now with the print</text>
  <text start="1961.32" dur="5.22">version so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s give and take</text>
  <text start="1963.84" dur="4.83">but you know what um what Brad told me</text>
  <text start="1966.54" dur="4.02">that time was that he mentioned you was</text>
  <text start="1968.67" dur="3.42">like you know he&amp;#39;s making it happen you</text>
  <text start="1970.56" dur="3.71">know praying medic is making it happen</text>
  <text start="1972.09" dur="4.19">so like I didn&amp;#39;t see why he wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1974.27" dur="4.48">write and I have a different situation</text>
  <text start="1976.28" dur="4.75">exactly yeah my situation is very</text>
  <text start="1978.75" dur="4.05">different you know as much as I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="1981.03" dur="4.38">to see people go the route of</text>
  <text start="1982.8" dur="5.79">self-publishing because I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="1985.41" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s as difficult as it was a few years</text>
  <text start="1988.59" dur="5.61">ago and I think that because you do</text>
  <text start="1991.68" dur="4.74">sacrifice certain things like and those</text>
  <text start="1994.2" dur="4.02">sacrifices may or may not at the end of</text>
  <text start="1996.42" dur="3.9">the day mean anything because if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1998.22" dur="4.95">writing traditional straightforward</text>
  <text start="2000.32" dur="4.98">content that isn&amp;#39;t too controversial the</text>
  <text start="2003.17" dur="3.84">loss of editorial control may not be a</text>
  <text start="2005.3" dur="3.54">big deal to you but if you&amp;#39;re writing</text>
  <text start="2007.01" dur="4.38">stuff that&amp;#39;s really edgy and kind of out</text>
  <text start="2008.84" dur="5.01">of the box and controversial and the</text>
  <text start="2011.39" dur="4.26">editor comes down stars backing out big</text>
  <text start="2013.85" dur="3.63">chunks of your manuscript that may</text>
  <text start="2015.65" dur="3.87">become a big issue it just depends on</text>
  <text start="2017.48" dur="3.69">what it is that you&amp;#39;re writing and that</text>
  <text start="2019.52" dur="4.44">has happened to</text>
  <text start="2021.17" dur="6.24">one friend of mine the other issue is</text>
  <text start="2023.96" dur="5.28">yeah you do sacrifice royalties when you</text>
  <text start="2027.41" dur="3.57">go with a vendor your traditional</text>
  <text start="2029.24" dur="3.99">publisher but you&amp;#39;re not making a lot of</text>
  <text start="2030.98" dur="5.64">money on royalties anyways what are you</text>
  <text start="2033.23" dur="6.39">really sacrificing exactly for example</text>
  <text start="2036.62" dur="5.1">if I mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s no guarantee</text>
  <text start="2039.62" dur="5.76">with a publisher that your book will</text>
  <text start="2041.72" dur="6.03">sell you know a lot of people assume to</text>
  <text start="2045.38" dur="4.049">my surprise most people don&amp;#39;t care you</text>
  <text start="2047.75" dur="3.419">know when I finally announced or let</text>
  <text start="2049.429" dur="4.561">people know that we&amp;#39;re with a publisher</text>
  <text start="2051.169" dur="5.131">I got like no feedback nobody cared</text>
  <text start="2053.99" dur="5.31">nobody I mean like it&amp;#39;s it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2056.3" dur="4.8">matter to people I don&amp;#39;t say that in a</text>
  <text start="2059.3" dur="3.35">self-deprecating way I say it like at</text>
  <text start="2061.1" dur="4.62">first we were keeping that to ourselves</text>
  <text start="2062.65" dur="5.35">because like we&amp;#39;re trying to go to</text>
  <text start="2065.72" dur="4.65">Canada this year we&amp;#39;ve been crowdfunding</text>
  <text start="2068" dur="3.84">to raise the money for it and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2070.37" dur="3.809">want people to think oh you&amp;#39;re an author</text>
  <text start="2071.84" dur="4.02">now don&amp;#39;t they they give like big huge</text>
  <text start="2074.179" dur="3.661">advances why do you need money or</text>
  <text start="2075.86" dur="4.53">whatever misconceptions people have</text>
  <text start="2077.84" dur="4.32">about about publishing about authors so</text>
  <text start="2080.39" dur="4.23">we hesitated to let people know at first</text>
  <text start="2082.16" dur="4.65">for a while now and then when the cat</text>
  <text start="2084.62" dur="6.39">was kind of out of the bag I i sent a</text>

  <text start="2100.55" dur="5.19">one book or a few books or you know but</text>
  <text start="2103.7" dur="3.84">people think like you&amp;#39;re rich if you</text>
  <text start="2105.74" dur="3.6">written a book and it&amp;#39;s always worried</text>
  <text start="2107.54" dur="4.68">about that being in my position as a</text>
  <text start="2109.34" dur="4.92">missionary and kind of blending support</text>
  <text start="2112.22" dur="4.47">with royalties and and other freelancing</text>
  <text start="2114.26" dur="5.43">things I do the last thing I wanted to</text>
  <text start="2116.69" dur="5.49">do is make people think we still didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2119.69" dur="4.62">need support or help or whatever okay so</text>
  <text start="2122.18" dur="5.88">we were keeping that to ourselves at</text>
  <text start="2124.31" dur="5.82">first but yeah and I understand that you</text>
  <text start="2128.06" dur="4.92">know like i said i&amp;#39;m in a very different</text>
  <text start="2130.13" dur="6.93">situation than you are i have been very</text>
  <text start="2132.98" dur="6.75">blessed by God with a team that allows</text>
  <text start="2137.06" dur="5.52">me to self-publish in a very cost</text>

  <text start="2435.91" dur="5.07">something in Amazon and that was the</text>
  <text start="2437.89" dur="5.55">highest like it peaked and then the day</text>
  <text start="2440.98" dur="4.59">that gospel ebooks randa thing it was</text>
  <text start="2443.44" dur="4.44">the same thing like I kept it at 499 for</text>
  <text start="2445.57" dur="5.61">like a week or two and then raised the</text>
  <text start="2447.88" dur="5.91">price to 999 again for those weeks it</text>
  <text start="2451.18" dur="5.16">kept doing good like it got a good good</text>
  <text start="2453.79" dur="5.01">exposure from that promotion it through</text>
  <text start="2456.34" dur="5.91">no amount of foresight on my part that</text>
  <text start="2458.8" dur="6.21">was when Kindle unlimited came out right</text>
  <text start="2462.25" dur="5.67">and so now so now I started getting a</text>
  <text start="2465.01" dur="6">buttload of borrows you don&amp;#39;t look at</text>
  <text start="2467.92" dur="4.77">your book for free yeah and now like a</text>
  <text start="2471.01" dur="3.33">seventy percent royalty when you sell it</text>
  <text start="2472.69" dur="5.28">like a ten-dollar book you know seven</text>
  <text start="2474.34" dur="6.12">dollars per copy is much better than the</text>
  <text start="2477.97" dur="5.1">two points something you get from a</text>
  <text start="2480.46" dur="5.73">borrow as a reader the idea of Kindle</text>
  <text start="2483.07" dur="5.97">unlimited is amazing as an author it is</text>
  <text start="2486.19" dur="4.98">crap if you want to get exposure than I</text>
  <text start="2489.04" dur="4.83">guess it&amp;#39;s good but if you want to make</text>
  <text start="2491.17" dur="5.58">a decent royalty off it not so good so I</text>
  <text start="2493.87" dur="6.24">guess if you&amp;#39;ve got like a three or four</text>
  <text start="2496.75" dur="5.85">or five dollar book in KDP select it</text>
  <text start="2500.11" dur="3.69">shows up in Kindle unlimited then you</text>
  <text start="2502.6" dur="3.03">know there you go it&amp;#39;s the amount of</text>
  <text start="2503.8" dur="3.66">royalty you&amp;#39;d get on it when someone</text>
  <text start="2505.63" dur="4.65">buys it is the same as what you&amp;#39;d get if</text>
  <text start="2507.46" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s in Kindle unlimited power to you so</text>
  <text start="2510.28" dur="4.86">this book stayed at the top of its</text>
  <text start="2513.19" dur="3.6">charts you know the top of pentecostal</text>
  <text start="2515.14" dur="6.48">books of stuff for basically the</text>
  <text start="2516.79" dur="8.82">remainder of my 90-day period basically</text>
  <text start="2521.62" dur="6">thanks to Kindle unlimited but because</text>
  <text start="2525.61" dur="4.14">you only get like and it&amp;#39;s different</text>
  <text start="2527.62" dur="4.62">every month right I get 22 points</text>
  <text start="2529.75" dur="6.05">something dollars if somebody borrows it</text>
  <text start="2532.24" dur="6.57">in recent past ten percent so borrow is</text>
  <text start="2535.8" dur="5.68">ranked the same way as a sale on Amazon</text>
  <text start="2538.81" dur="4.35">so my book is continuing to stay like at</text>
  <text start="2541.48" dur="5.04">the top of the charts but then I</text>
  <text start="2543.16" dur="5.76">basically removed it kept it at 999 and</text>
  <text start="2546.52" dur="4.35">I went to book baby where I published it</text>
  <text start="2548.92" dur="4.26">to all of the platforms and it basically</text>
  <text start="2550.87" dur="3.85">tanked and went back to selling about</text>
  <text start="2553.18" dur="4.33">how it did before</text>
  <text start="2554.72" dur="4.44">it was in Kindle unlimited so it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="2557.51" dur="4.349">of like a double-edged sword you know</text>
  <text start="2559.16" dur="4.41">and I&amp;#39;ve seen other books of mine in</text>
  <text start="2561.859" dur="4.26">Kindle unlimited and nothing different</text>
  <text start="2563.57" dur="5.34">happens but with the tongues book</text>
  <text start="2566.119" dur="5.821">because it&amp;#39;s like a ten-dollar broke 999</text>
  <text start="2568.91" dur="6.15">bucket over um maybe it&amp;#39;s viewed as more</text>
  <text start="2571.94" dur="5.58">of a deal to borrow it when the monthly</text>
  <text start="2575.06" dur="4.65">costs of Kindle unlimited is that price</text>
  <text start="2577.52" dur="4.23">and it&amp;#39;s one of the books you can get</text>
  <text start="2579.71" dur="5.52">for free but as an author it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="2581.75" dur="5.099">like yeah but it&amp;#39;s not really it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2585.23" dur="3.36">really worth it it&amp;#39;s about it&amp;#39;s about</text>
  <text start="2586.849" dur="3.661">the same as traditional publishing</text>
  <text start="2588.59" dur="5.73">royalty he said that I hadn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="2590.51" dur="6.24">similar thing going on when Amazon</text>
  <text start="2594.32" dur="4.89">decided to launch their Kindle unlimited</text>
  <text start="2596.75" dur="5.34">program I was actually in the middle of</text>
  <text start="2599.21" dur="4.29">a paid advertisement period I remember</text>

  <text start="2667.19" dur="4.74">way to compete with other sales and</text>
  <text start="2670.04" dur="3.21">marketing promotions that companies are</text>
  <text start="2671.93" dur="3.75">doing where they were enrolling people</text>

  <text start="2943.33" dur="3.57">not even not even just like in the</text>
  <text start="2945.4" dur="4.92">Christian kind of way of looking at it</text>

  <text start="2959.599" dur="3.541">something for free so they wouldn&amp;#39;t but</text>
  <text start="2961.7" dur="3.21">then you know I&amp;#39;m not saying that</text>
  <text start="2963.14" dur="4.32">somebody says it&amp;#39;s because they want</text>
  <text start="2964.91" dur="4.35">your book for free but I think you were</text>
  <text start="2967.46" dur="3.78">in that discussion where I posted</text>
  <text start="2969.26" dur="3.45">something on Facebook that like asking</text>
  <text start="2971.24" dur="4.8">an author when their book is going to be</text>
  <text start="2972.71" dur="6.27">free it&amp;#39;s like asking an artist to</text>

  <text start="2981.05" dur="4.529">don&amp;#39;t do that and I and I was surprised</text>
  <text start="2983.599" dur="4.951">how many people came in to defend that</text>
  <text start="2985.579" dur="4.831">type of thing well Keith Green gave his</text>
  <text start="2988.55" dur="4.74">music away for free and then somebody</text>
  <text start="2990.41" dur="4.59">else said no actually he didn&amp;#39;t he would</text>
  <text start="2993.29" dur="3.269">let people who couldn&amp;#39;t afford it he</text>
  <text start="2995" dur="4.079">would you know he would give his music</text>
  <text start="2996.559" dur="4.141">away free to them just stuff like that</text>
  <text start="2999.079" dur="4.831">does this in tight is an entitlement</text>
  <text start="3000.7" dur="5.7">mentality and I wish I could say that</text>
  <text start="3003.91" dur="5.07">what I&amp;#39;m about to say is not true but it</text>
  <text start="3006.4" dur="4.98">seems like we were really guilty of that</text>
  <text start="3008.98" dur="4.53">in the Christian kind of in the church</text>
  <text start="3011.38" dur="3.689">more than it&amp;#39;s a cultural thing that</text>
  <text start="3013.51" dur="4.109">we&amp;#39;ve all been in had ingrained in our</text>
  <text start="3015.069" dur="4.26">mind I had to have my wife kind of go</text>
  <text start="3017.619" dur="3.48">through some psychotherapy with me to</text>
  <text start="3019.329" dur="5.311">get that out of my brain because I could</text>
  <text start="3021.099" dur="5.791">not see the value of you know artists</text>
  <text start="3024.64" dur="5.429">and creative people like painters and</text>
  <text start="3026.89" dur="5.04">writers and musicians do they really</text>
  <text start="3030.069" dur="2.881">have a right to charge for what it is</text>
  <text start="3031.93" dur="2.429">that they&amp;#39;re producing well you know</text>
  <text start="3032.95" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re using their talents they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="3043.15" dur="7.169">and price good quality pastels they are</text>
  <text start="3047.02" dur="5.24">insanely expensive and canvases there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3050.319" dur="4.411">a lot of money that goes into producing</text>
  <text start="3052.26" dur="3.91">painting and she&amp;#39;s hoping to start</text>
  <text start="3054.73" dur="3.24">selling her paintings but there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="3056.17" dur="3.72">of money that goes into that and yet</text>
  <text start="3057.97" dur="4.26">there is still this mentality out there</text>
  <text start="3059.89" dur="4.89">that people would essentially expect her</text>
  <text start="3062.23" dur="5.49">to be giving it away for free hey I</text>
  <text start="3064.78" dur="5.309">think we have a ways to go in educating</text>
  <text start="3067.72" dur="4.23">ourselves about the value of our time</text>
  <text start="3070.089" dur="3.841">and our efforts and our talents it</text>
  <text start="3071.95" dur="5.159">hopefully the discussion will will move</text>
  <text start="3073.93" dur="5.159">forward I think because candle is doing</text>
  <text start="3077.109" dur="4.681">their Kindle unlimited business model</text>
  <text start="3079.089" dur="6.091">they&amp;#39;re taking after things like Spotify</text>

  <text start="3090.05" dur="6.81">listen to for free and then the the end</text>
  <text start="3092.99" dur="5.97">result is in the case of music artists</text>
  <text start="3096.86" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t make almost anything I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3098.96" dur="3.72">if you saw in the news whatever how</text>
  <text start="3100.34" dur="5.4">Taylor Swift remove yourself from</text>
  <text start="3102.68" dur="5.31">Spotify because it&amp;#39;s like she makes</text>
  <text start="3105.74" dur="4.86">nothing off of all these people</text>
  <text start="3107.99" dur="4.35">listening to her music and Spotify tried</text>
  <text start="3110.6" dur="4.17">to do the whole no no no no no no no no</text>
  <text start="3112.34" dur="6.45">no come back but then just a few weeks</text>
  <text start="3114.77" dur="6.599">ago I saw that they tripled their losses</text>
  <text start="3118.79" dur="4.5">in the last year like with all the</text>
  <text start="3121.369" dur="4.111">licensing and payouts and things they</text>
  <text start="3123.29" dur="5.01">have to do they&amp;#39;re actually operating at</text>

  <text start="3128.3" dur="5.79">tripled their losses this year so I</text>
  <text start="3132.59" dur="3.24">don&amp;#39;t know how the business model that</text>
  <text start="3134.09" dur="5.49">they operate on will keep going forward</text>
  <text start="3135.83" dur="5.46">cuz and our amazon themselves how Jeff</text>
  <text start="3139.58" dur="3">Bezos is always coming out saying how</text>
  <text start="3141.29" dur="3.3">like well we&amp;#39;re not actually making</text>
  <text start="3142.58" dur="4.35">money or you know our shareholders</text>
  <text start="3144.59" dur="3.24">haven&amp;#39;t gotten their money back yet so</text>
  <text start="3146.93" dur="3.99">there&amp;#39;s all these things where it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="3147.83" dur="6.12">I wonder how long you know the camel can</text>
  <text start="3150.92" dur="5.13">keep carrying all those straws before</text>
  <text start="3153.95" dur="4.62">its back brakes and so I don&amp;#39;t know how</text>
  <text start="3156.05" dur="4.11">this whole unlimited model for books is</text>
  <text start="3158.57" dur="4.17">gonna work or if it&amp;#39;ll keep working in</text>
  <text start="3160.16" dur="4.5">the future well i watch netflix so i</text>
  <text start="3162.74" dur="3.18">don&amp;#39;t know but but i know they have all</text>

  <text start="3165.92" dur="4.8">worked out that they do profit in some</text>

  <text start="3367.09" dur="4.86">the people who say you know what me too</text>
  <text start="3369.04" dur="4.62">i want to do any stuff is that something</text>
  <text start="3371.95" dur="4.23">that you kind of wrestle with two um</text>
  <text start="3373.66" dur="5.91">well because my healing book wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="3376.18" dur="4.98">how-to manual it was more like a let me</text>
  <text start="3379.57" dur="3.21">let me convince you let me change your</text>
  <text start="3381.16" dur="3.45">mind let me let you know I view it as</text>
  <text start="3382.78" dur="3.93">like an entry-level booked into the</text>
  <text start="3384.61" dur="4.71">subjects your to essentially trying to</text>
  <text start="3386.71" dur="5.4">evangelize cessation to start you yes</text>
  <text start="3389.32" dur="6.03">and no because my background was in that</text>
  <text start="3392.11" dur="5.16">type of church and I heard all the yeah</text>
  <text start="3395.35" dur="3.6">arguments against any rumors of people</text>
  <text start="3397.27" dur="3.06">who allegedly are like that in the</text>
  <text start="3398.95" dur="3.21">charismatic church and stuff or they</text>
  <text start="3400.33" dur="4.34">don&amp;#39;t take medicine because they will</text>
  <text start="3402.16" dur="4.8">even faith healing I had this particular</text>
  <text start="3404.67" dur="3.91">appreciation for people who were</text>
  <text start="3406.96" dur="5.13">open-minded and in that kind of</text>
  <text start="3408.58" dur="5.45">situation and I think before I started</text>
  <text start="3412.09" dur="4.38">writing there was an experience I had in</text>
  <text start="3414.03" dur="4.72">Pensacola I went to fire school of</text>
  <text start="3416.47" dur="5.13">ministry in Pensacola fur and I went on</text>
  <text start="3418.75" dur="4.85">a mission trip north into North Carolina</text>
  <text start="3421.6" dur="5.25">we were doing some kind of door-to-door</text>
  <text start="3423.6" dur="5.38">not evangelism but like inviting people</text>
  <text start="3426.85" dur="4.95">to something I forget what it was and I</text>
  <text start="3428.98" dur="5.19">met a guy in his wife and they were</text>
  <text start="3431.8" dur="5.55">burnt and worn out with church and</text>
  <text start="3434.17" dur="5.13">somehow in the conversation I remember</text>
  <text start="3437.35" dur="4.29">they were from like an evangelical or</text>
  <text start="3439.3" dur="4.41">Baptist type of church and we were we</text>
  <text start="3441.64" dur="4.35">were chatting we were talking and when</text>
  <text start="3443.71" dur="3.87">all was said and done like we pray for</text>
  <text start="3445.99" dur="4.5">them to receive the baptism the Holy</text>
  <text start="3447.58" dur="5.37">Spirit so like a month or two later the</text>
  <text start="3450.49" dur="5.88">guy who was running the trip we went on</text>
  <text start="3452.95" dur="5.79">he contacted me and told me how that</text>
  <text start="3456.37" dur="4.17">couple came and they said they really</text>
  <text start="3458.74" dur="5.85">appreciated that that Canadian guy</text>
  <text start="3460.54" dur="5.37">because we have had people who they find</text>
  <text start="3464.59" dur="3.87">out we don&amp;#39;t speak in tongues or were</text>
  <text start="3465.91" dur="4.98">you know not charismatic and then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3468.46" dur="4.47">like were their project and this guy was</text>
  <text start="3470.89" dur="4.65">just chatting with us and made sense and</text>
  <text start="3472.93" dur="4.62">dismantled some of our ideas and and was</text>
  <text start="3475.54" dur="4.44">just not going for anything he was just</text>
  <text start="3477.55" dur="3.9">talking to us befriending us I remember</text>
  <text start="3479.98" dur="3.93">that always sticking out in my mind like</text>
  <text start="3481.45" dur="3.93">I want to be that guy I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="3483.91" dur="3.45">just try to convince you of something</text>
  <text start="3485.38" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;m saying but i would rather</text>
  <text start="3487.36" dur="3.93">you can go away and go okay well I</text>
  <text start="3489.94" dur="3.24">appreciate that he listened to mayor</text>
  <text start="3491.29" dur="4.44">took the time or whatever and so I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3493.18" dur="4.53">always tried to write that way or come</text>
  <text start="3495.73" dur="4.1">across that way if possible in writing</text>
  <text start="3497.71" dur="4.22">from having come out of like a</text>
  <text start="3499.83" dur="5.4">cessationist type of church background</text>
  <text start="3501.93" dur="5.32">getting filled in the Holy Spirit and</text>
  <text start="3505.23" dur="3.76">experiencing things that they would tell</text>
  <text start="3507.25" dur="3.75">you or not for today in whatever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3508.99" dur="4.71">like I feel like that has tempered my</text>
  <text start="3511" dur="5.67">zeal to have patience with people who</text>
  <text start="3513.7" dur="5.46">aren&amp;#39;t there yet and so so yeah that it</text>
  <text start="3516.67" dur="4.02">that does play a big role in my world</text>
  <text start="3519.16" dur="4.08">view of how I try to write these things</text>
  <text start="3520.69" dur="4.38">I feel like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m always coming at it</text>
  <text start="3523.24" dur="4.62">from that angle or that that it does</text>
  <text start="3525.07" dur="5.55">have a part in okay if somebody from</text>
  <text start="3527.86" dur="6.24">this church picks up this book I want</text>
  <text start="3530.62" dur="6.33">them to not be able to say just more</text>
  <text start="3534.1" dur="4.35">charismatic fluff and that incidentally</text>
  <text start="3536.95" dur="3.96">has happened like somebody wrote my</text>
  <text start="3538.45" dur="4.65">wrote like a one or two store review on</text>
  <text start="3540.91" dur="5.49">the healing book and and called me like</text>
  <text start="3543.1" dur="4.47">over the top as far as charismatic stuff</text>
  <text start="3546.4" dur="4.26">goes sounds like I&amp;#39;ve never been called</text>
  <text start="3547.57" dur="4.92">that before that&amp;#39;s cute and like that</text>
  <text start="3550.66" dur="3.78">was new okay so you know maybe that</text>
  <text start="3552.49" dur="3.51">person didn&amp;#39;t didn&amp;#39;t receive how I was</text>
  <text start="3554.44" dur="3.51">trying to right through that that</text>
  <text start="3556" dur="4.23">particular book but that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3557.95" dur="4.65">going for anyway that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="3560.23" dur="5.07">like if somebody is a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="3562.6" dur="5.7">against what I&amp;#39;m saying I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="3565.3" dur="4.74">them to feel I&amp;#39;m very combative when</text>
  <text start="3568.3" dur="4.26">they&amp;#39;re writing it is that make sense</text>
  <text start="3570.04" dur="5.49">yeah it does make sense and I think</text>
  <text start="3572.56" dur="6.09">there&amp;#39;s a lot of value in that as I grow</text>
  <text start="3575.53" dur="5.7">a little older I&amp;#39;m more inclined to</text>
  <text start="3578.65" dur="4.23">write from a perspective of if you are</text>
  <text start="3581.23" dur="4.35">one of those readers who has ears to</text>
  <text start="3582.88" dur="4.2">hear what I&amp;#39;m saying this is going to</text>
  <text start="3585.58" dur="2.55">bless you and challenge you and</text>
  <text start="3587.08" dur="3.09">encourage you if you&amp;#39;re not one of those</text>
  <text start="3588.13" dur="4.53">people that has ears to hear that&amp;#39;s okay</text>
  <text start="3590.17" dur="3.75">the message isn&amp;#39;t for you and I think</text>
  <text start="3592.66" dur="2.97">there&amp;#39;s a lot of wisdom and writing that</text>
  <text start="3593.92" dur="4.92">way I think a lot of times were too</text>
  <text start="3595.63" dur="5.16">combative in our theology we want to</text>
  <text start="3598.84" dur="3.84">just bash people into believing our way</text>
  <text start="3600.79" dur="3.57">is the right way and I I don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="3602.68" dur="4.32">there&amp;#39;s a lot of wisdom and doing that</text>
  <text start="3604.36" dur="5.1">right and so and if I can use the</text>
  <text start="3607" dur="4.65">tongues book as another example when I</text>
  <text start="3609.46" dur="4.68">had the proofreaders like that initial</text>
  <text start="3611.65" dur="4.56">phase of I just gotten this edited and</text>
  <text start="3614.14" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;m giving it to proofreaders the type</text>
  <text start="3616.21" dur="4.69">of feedback I got from people was that</text>
  <text start="3618.34" dur="4.75">you can put yourself in my shoes Oh</text>
  <text start="3620.9" dur="5.58">lot when you&amp;#39;re reading my stories in</text>
  <text start="3623.09" dur="5.94">this case like how many of us have had</text>
  <text start="3626.48" dur="4.5">really overzealous charismatic slapping</text>
  <text start="3629.03" dur="4.17">us around praying for us casting demons</text>
  <text start="3630.98" dur="4.65">out of us trying to get us filled and</text>
  <text start="3633.2" dur="4.77">just getting ticked off that we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3635.63" dur="4.62">speaking in tongues and so we we try to</text>
  <text start="3637.97" dur="3.72">fake it or we don&amp;#39;t fake it and that</text>
  <text start="3640.25" dur="3.15">just aggravates them and they they you</text>
  <text start="3641.69" dur="4.95">know they want you to confess sin or</text>
  <text start="3643.4" dur="4.62">like whatever silly nonsensical stuff is</text>
  <text start="3646.64" dur="5.07">hot like I remember my friend Charles</text>
  <text start="3648.02" dur="6.18">when we were teenagers he hated the</text>
  <text start="3651.71" dur="3.84">Pentecostals and there was some girl he</text>
  <text start="3654.2" dur="4.35">liked and he went to her church with her</text>
  <text start="3655.55" dur="5.04">and afterwards somebody encouraged him</text>
  <text start="3658.55" dur="3.99">or or shoved him forward it wasn&amp;#39;t an</text>
  <text start="3660.59" dur="3.96">altar call but it was like for people</text>
  <text start="3662.54" dur="4.23">who haven&amp;#39;t received the baptism the</text>
  <text start="3664.55" dur="3.63">Holy Spirit and want to speak and done</text>
  <text start="3666.77" dur="3.33">and he didn&amp;#39;t really want any of this</text>
  <text start="3668.18" dur="4.5">but like was just kind of like being</text>
  <text start="3670.1" dur="3.9">shoved forward and I remember him come</text>
  <text start="3672.68" dur="3.27">back on i&amp;#39;m never going to that church</text>
  <text start="3674" dur="4.47">again man they were like you know</text>
  <text start="3675.95" dur="4.74">spittin and yelling and then whatever</text>
  <text start="3678.47" dur="5.01">and then and just you know suffocating</text>
  <text start="3680.69" dur="4.77">me you know it was like and and one guy</text>
  <text start="3683.48" dur="3.48">was like just confess all your sins</text>
  <text start="3685.46" dur="3.6">boykin fin you know and he&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3686.96" dur="4.23">not a sinner I mean I&amp;#39;m saved I know</text>
  <text start="3689.06" dur="3.27">Jesus and remember him sharing the</text>
  <text start="3691.19" dur="3.75">stories like I&amp;#39;m never going there again</text>
  <text start="3692.33" dur="4.47">and you know years later he&amp;#39;s you know</text>
  <text start="3694.94" dur="3.99">involved in a charismatic church now but</text>
  <text start="3696.8" dur="4.83">you know and I remember those friends</text>
  <text start="3698.93" dur="4.77">who overzealously wanted to get me</text>
  <text start="3701.63" dur="3.93">filled and would get annoyed when it</text>
  <text start="3703.7" dur="3.72">wasn&amp;#39;t happening and and then you know</text>
  <text start="3705.56" dur="3.9">the things I learned for like ah well</text>
  <text start="3707.42" dur="4.62">this is not how you go about it and so I</text>
  <text start="3709.46" dur="4.74">just remember like that is how I came</text>
  <text start="3712.04" dur="3.69">about like writing this and Pete so</text>
  <text start="3714.2" dur="3.21">people who read it would say to me like</text>
  <text start="3715.73" dur="3.84">people who are proof reading it in that</text>
  <text start="3717.41" dur="3.66">initial phase said you know what what I</text>
  <text start="3719.57" dur="3.51">liked about this book more than your</text>
  <text start="3721.07" dur="3.81">other ones is how i can put myself in</text>
  <text start="3723.08" dur="3.6">your shoes because i&amp;#39;ve had almost the</text>
  <text start="3724.88" dur="4.2">exact same things happen there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="3726.68" dur="3.99">more humor like because let&amp;#39;s face it</text>
  <text start="3729.08" dur="5.91">speaking in tongues is a pretty funny</text>
  <text start="3730.67" dur="6.6">subjects you know yeah well that&amp;#39;s good</text>
  <text start="3734.99" dur="5.01">i mean we all have these perspectives</text>
  <text start="3737.27" dur="4.62">that we develop through experiences in</text>
  <text start="3740" dur="4.59">our lives that shape us into who we are</text>
  <text start="3741.89" dur="4.35">i have a couple more subjects i want to</text>
  <text start="3744.59" dur="5.15">talk about if you still have the time i</text>
  <text start="3746.24" dur="6.03">do why don&amp;#39;t we shift gears and go into</text>
  <text start="3749.74" dur="4.75">talking about content marketing and</text>
  <text start="3752.27" dur="4.68">email lists okay</text>
  <text start="3754.49" dur="5.39">how have your experience has been so far</text>
  <text start="3756.95" dur="5.46">with blogging and being a writer and</text>
  <text start="3759.88" dur="4.81">loaded question because i feel like i&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3762.41" dur="3.57">still learning I feel like I keep</text>
  <text start="3764.69" dur="5.64">throwing things at the wall to see what</text>
  <text start="3765.98" dur="7.23">sticks um email list I learned about</text>
  <text start="3770.33" dur="6.09">that a couple years ago and I am not</text>
  <text start="3773.21" dur="6.45">particularly impressed I don&amp;#39;t have as</text>
  <text start="3776.42" dur="5.67">large of a emailing list as I i thought</text>
  <text start="3779.66" dur="3.959">i would obtain by now you know every</text>
  <text start="3782.09" dur="3.48">time I write something I sent something</text>
  <text start="3783.619" dur="4.201">out I I will get two or three or four</text>
  <text start="3785.57" dur="4.62">responses i&amp;#39;ll get people who who write</text>
  <text start="3787.82" dur="4.44">me back and and i try to maintain that</text>
  <text start="3790.19" dur="4.56">communication like i&amp;#39;ve noticed this</text>
  <text start="3792.26" dur="5.75">every time I learned some new thing for</text>
  <text start="3794.75" dur="5.82">how to get email subscribers I try it</text>
  <text start="3798.01" dur="5.32">you know place the thing here or have a</text>
  <text start="3800.57" dur="5.52">pop-up or do whatever on your site it</text>
  <text start="3803.33" dur="4.289">always starts off good for like two or</text>
  <text start="3806.09" dur="4.07">three weeks and then it kind of dies</text>
  <text start="3807.619" dur="6">down I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s like add</text>
  <text start="3810.16" dur="6.4">blindness or whatever but everything</text>
  <text start="3813.619" dur="4.741">I&amp;#39;ve ever tried I feel like oh wow looks</text>
  <text start="3816.56" dur="3.99">like this will be the new way I I go</text>
  <text start="3818.36" dur="4.86">about doing that with a whip with list</text>
  <text start="3820.55" dur="6.27">building and then it it disappears like</text>
  <text start="3823.22" dur="4.889">for example in all of my books I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="3826.82" dur="3.539">putting a thing at the front where</text>
  <text start="3828.109" dur="4.081">people could get a free audiobook the</text>
  <text start="3830.359" dur="4.321">audio version of increase your faith</text>
  <text start="3832.19" dur="5.73">when they sign up for my newsletter list</text>
  <text start="3834.68" dur="6.03">and so every time I&amp;#39;ve done a free</text>
  <text start="3837.92" dur="4.26">promotion I would get new signups you</text>
  <text start="3840.71" dur="3.69">know because typically when i&amp;#39;m doing a</text>
  <text start="3842.18" dur="3.6">free giveaway that could be a few</text>
  <text start="3844.4" dur="3.75">thousand people who download the book</text>

  <text start="4666.28" dur="4.23">on my game with punctuation on this book</text>
  <text start="4668.47" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s something I need to do better on</text>

  <text start="4704.25" dur="3.39">know so i don&amp;#39;t know i think even when</text>
  <text start="4705.87" dur="4.41">people disagree at the book they tend to</text>
  <text start="4707.64" dur="5.34">still be generous that way and if they</text>

  <text start="4738.99" dur="5.13">people who&amp;#39;ve gotten it for free or</text>
  <text start="4740.91" dur="6.09">whatever the reason i ask is because the</text>
  <text start="4744.12" dur="5.91">the kind of tree star or negative</text>
  <text start="4747" dur="5.34">reviews i get for any of my books it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4750.03" dur="4.35">almost always like a week after having</text>

  <text start="4763.92" dur="4.62">writing okay well some more about that</text>
  <text start="4766.47" dur="5.01">would have been helpful I think through</text>
