  <text start="231.77" dur="5.73">in previous post Q has suggested that</text>
  <text start="234.05" dur="5.27">the master plan of the CIA at least for</text>
  <text start="237.5" dur="5.3">rogue states like North Korea and Iran</text>
  <text start="239.32" dur="6.88">is to perpetuate war give them weapons</text>
  <text start="242.8" dur="6.27">and then allow them these rogue nations</text>
  <text start="246.2" dur="5.31">to perpetuate war which gives the CIA</text>

  <text start="326.07" dur="4.68">contribute to this conversation I have a</text>
  <text start="327.9" dur="5.49">lot of Dreams from God I&amp;#39;ve been having</text>
  <text start="330.75" dur="3.42">them for a long time and on February</text>
  <text start="333.39" dur="4.95">13th</text>
  <text start="334.17" dur="7.32">I had the following dream in this dream</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="5.1">I was watching Q as he was posting there</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="3.75">were a lot of posts and all of them had</text>
  <text start="343.44" dur="4.38">to do with the Supreme Court judges and</text>
  <text start="345.24" dur="6.12">cases that they were involved in the</text>
  <text start="347.82" dur="5.97">post clearly indicated corruption and</text>
  <text start="351.36" dur="4.74">even possibly conflict of interest with</text>
  <text start="353.79" dur="5.46">these cases at the end of the dream the</text>
  <text start="356.1" dur="5.67">text turned yellow and what I saw was</text>
  <text start="359.25" dur="5.07">like almost like yellow text on a white</text>
  <text start="361.77" dur="5.13">page and that was the end of the dream</text>
  <text start="364.32" dur="4.8">my interpretation of the dream is that I</text>
  <text start="366.9" dur="5.13">believe Q is going to at some point</text>
  <text start="369.12" dur="5.49">tell us about or highlight corruption in</text>
  <text start="372.03" dur="8.28">the Supreme Court so we will get to wait</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="9.2">and see if that actually happens so Q</text>
  <text start="380.31" dur="6.69">brought this one up again and I&amp;#39;m glad</text>

  <text start="2208.579" dur="7.121">he also mentions that Clark was</text>
  <text start="2212.16" dur="7.379">anti-trump this is a an NBC News</text>
  <text start="2215.7" dur="6.03">interview where Clark basically says</text>
  <text start="2219.539" dur="3.901">that Trump is acting immature and</text>
  <text start="2221.73" dur="3.99">doesn&amp;#39;t really know what he&amp;#39;s doing with</text>
  <text start="2223.44" dur="4.889">respect to foreign policy this was</text>
  <text start="2225.72" dur="4.889">during the campaign before Trump was</text>
  <text start="2228.329" dur="6.601">elected this is a more recent article</text>
  <text start="2230.609" dur="5.021">that&amp;#39;s an interview with Clark and he</text>
  <text start="2234.93" dur="2.59">was</text>
  <text start="2235.63" dur="4.2">very impressed with Trump&amp;#39;s handling of</text>
  <text start="2237.52" dur="5.31">foreign policy during his trip to Poland</text>
  <text start="2239.83" dur="5.37">so Clark and enough Clark is totally on</text>
  <text start="2242.83" dur="4.11">board of Trump yet but just some</text>
  <text start="2245.2" dur="6.75">articles interviews you can look at if</text>
  <text start="2246.94" dur="7.76">you&amp;#39;re interested so the UNAM finishes</text>
  <text start="2251.95" dur="4.89">up with the observation that the key is</text>
  <text start="2254.7" dur="4.6">that the media is changing the narrative</text>
  <text start="2256.84" dur="4.41">using secure drop which is dictated</text>
  <text start="2259.3" dur="6.6">heavily by Snowden and the big question</text>
  <text start="2261.25" dur="7.11">is who controls Snowden if you&amp;#39;re if you</text>
  <text start="2265.9" dur="4.8">haven&amp;#39;t done much looking into secure</text>
  <text start="2268.36" dur="5.7">drop and freedom the press foundation</text>
  <text start="2270.7" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s worth looking into the media is</text>
  <text start="2274.06" dur="6.06">evidently using secure drop and using</text>
  <text start="2276.97" dur="4.5">tor browser to get information from</text>
  <text start="2280.12" dur="4.05">confidential sources inside the</text>
  <text start="2281.47" dur="3.96">government we all know that the FBI and</text>
  <text start="2284.17" dur="2.7">the Department of Justice and people in</text>
  <text start="2285.43" dur="4.86">the intelligence community have been</text>
  <text start="2286.87" dur="7.77">leaking classified information to</text>
  <text start="2290.29" dur="7.65">reporters for a long time but it really</text>
  <text start="2294.64" dur="5.7">got bad during the Trump administration</text>
  <text start="2297.94" dur="3.78">it&amp;#39;s tapered off a little bit because</text>
  <text start="2300.34" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;ve identified some leakers and</text>
  <text start="2301.72" dur="4.53">gotten rid of them but they do all this</text>
  <text start="2303.88" dur="4.35">through secure job and they have this</text>
  <text start="2306.25" dur="4.41">process where they use two laptop</text>
  <text start="2308.23" dur="4.41">computers they use flash drives one</text>
  <text start="2310.66" dur="4.65">computer is connected to the Internet</text>
  <text start="2312.64" dur="4.68">the other one isn&amp;#39;t and they use these</text>
  <text start="2315.31" dur="5.67">flash drives and they transfer files</text>
  <text start="2317.32" dur="7.38">between the whistleblower or the leaker</text>
  <text start="2320.98" dur="4.98">and the journalist and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2324.7" dur="4.17">interested in knowing more about that</text>
  <text start="2325.96" dur="4.59">process it&amp;#39;s worth looking into but the</text>
  <text start="2328.87" dur="3.96">big question is who controls Snowden I</text>
  <text start="2330.55" dur="8.31">think we&amp;#39;re seeing more and more exactly</text>
  <text start="2332.83" dur="9.45">who controls Snowden so Q responds James</text>
  <text start="2338.86" dur="5.7">Dolan dead suicide Swartz dead suicide</text>
  <text start="2342.28" dur="5.09">Kevin Paulson turned over secure drop to</text>
  <text start="2344.56" dur="9.54">freedom of the press John Perry Barlow</text>
  <text start="2347.37" dur="12.46">187 post name drop and then at Snowden</text>
  <text start="2354.1" dur="7.47">you are now liability so Hugh has</text>
  <text start="2359.83" dur="5.79">previously suggested that these guys</text>
  <text start="2361.57" dur="7.269">were not victims of suicide that they</text>
  <text start="2365.62" dur="7.599">were actually probably killed by the CIA</text>
  <text start="2368.839" dur="9.121">what I&amp;#39;m saying in all this is the idea</text>
  <text start="2373.219" dur="8.09">that the CIA needed to control the</text>
  <text start="2377.96" dur="5.25">narrative of the mainstream media and</text>
  <text start="2381.309" dur="4.69">how do you do that when you have people</text>
  <text start="2383.21" dur="6.119">who are all champions for freedom of the</text>
  <text start="2385.999" dur="5.431">press well what if you take over the</text>
  <text start="2389.329" dur="5.371">freedom of the press foundation get rid</text>
  <text start="2391.43" dur="6">of the founders who are hardcore freedom</text>
  <text start="2394.7" dur="5.909">of the press people put in patsies who</text>
  <text start="2397.43" dur="6.72">are sympathetic to your agenda or maybe</text>
  <text start="2400.609" dur="5.101">being blackmailed they take over secure</text>
  <text start="2404.15" dur="5.52">drop they take over freedom the press</text>
  <text start="2405.71" dur="6.299">foundation they allow the CIA to monitor</text>
  <text start="2409.67" dur="4.46">all the transfer of information and that</text>
  <text start="2412.009" dur="4.98">way the CIA can control the narrative</text>
  <text start="2414.13" dur="6.28">control the leaking control the</text>
  <text start="2416.989" dur="5.13">whistleblowers that is what I see being</text>
  <text start="2420.41" dur="9.859">played out here and Snowden is a part of</text>
  <text start="2422.119" dur="11.22">it and Q says you are now a liability so</text>
  <text start="2430.269" dur="8.02">we&amp;#39;re gonna go back to a post from</text>
  <text start="2433.339" dur="6.9">January 27 one of the nuns mentioned</text>
  <text start="2438.289" dur="3.33">Snowden would not have been able to get</text>

  <text start="2479.809" dur="5.93">sleeping pill thank you so like I said</text>
  <text start="2483.109" dur="4.94">we&amp;#39;re learning more and more that</text>
  <text start="2485.739" dur="6.911">Snowden has been working with the CIA</text>
  <text start="2488.049" dur="7.18">call along alright and and look there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2492.65" dur="8.88">a reason why we need to know this there</text>
  <text start="2495.229" dur="8.881">is this perception that Snowden is</text>
  <text start="2501.53" dur="7.44">a good guy Snowden is a hero he exposed</text>
  <text start="2504.11" dur="7.11">the spying of the NSA and it was good</text>
  <text start="2508.97" dur="3.9">for the American people to know that the</text>
  <text start="2511.22" dur="5.97">NSA was surveilling people I was</text>
  <text start="2512.87" dur="7.95">gathering all this data but what we</text>
  <text start="2517.19" dur="6.68">weren&amp;#39;t told is that the exposure of the</text>
  <text start="2520.82" dur="6.63">NSA and their spy program was probably</text>
  <text start="2523.87" dur="6.52">all done by the CIA because the CIA</text>
  <text start="2527.45" dur="5.1">wants to get rid of the NSA and take</text>
  <text start="2530.39" dur="6.36">over and become the predominant</text>
  <text start="2532.55" dur="8.04">Intelligence Agency and Snowden helped</text>
  <text start="2536.75" dur="7.29">do that so Assange is painted by the</text>
  <text start="2540.59" dur="5.49">mainstream media as a rapist and a</text>
  <text start="2544.04" dur="5.55">pedophile and all these you know</text>
  <text start="2546.08" dur="5.22">horrible things but the entire time it I</text>
  <text start="2549.59" dur="4.71">believe</text>
  <text start="2551.3" dur="5.61">Assange is a good person who is helping</text>
  <text start="2554.3" dur="10.38">the cause and Snowden is actually a</text>
  <text start="2556.91" dur="11.7">black hat all right this post Q is going</text>
  <text start="2564.68" dur="7.52">after Jack Dorsey again civilian puppet</text>

  <text start="2581.72" dur="9.93">controlling you t-minus 1234 all right</text>
  <text start="2586.37" dur="8.25">so Jack Dorsey is useful to the puppet</text>
  <text start="2591.65" dur="6.06">masters because he can suppress</text>
  <text start="2594.62" dur="7.83">conservative views on social media he</text>

  <text start="2768.64" dur="4.959">perhaps most disturbing of all is a fact</text>
  <text start="2771.349" dur="4.831">that the extent of experimentation on</text>
  <text start="2773.599" dur="4.02">human subjects was unknown the records</text>
  <text start="2776.18" dur="4.169">of all these activities were destroyed</text>

  <text start="2789.349" dur="4.801">no additional records or information</text>
  <text start="2791.03" dur="7.41">were forthcoming so they did not know</text>
  <text start="2794.15" dur="6.3">the extent of the experiments down here</text>
  <text start="2798.44" dur="3.72">the records reveal far more extensive</text>
  <text start="2800.45" dur="5.07">series of experiments than had</text>
  <text start="2802.16" dur="5.55">previously been thought 86 universities</text>
  <text start="2805.52" dur="4.47">or institutions were involved new</text>
  <text start="2807.71" dur="4.83">instances of unethical behavior were</text>
  <text start="2809.99" dur="4.71">revealed so from the original</text>
  <text start="2812.54" dur="5.76">investigations of the MKULTRA mind</text>
  <text start="2814.7" dur="5.13">control programs this is saying that the</text>

  <text start="2819.83" dur="6.539">50s did not fully cover all the</text>

  <text start="2826.369" dur="5.131">involved that the experiments were much</text>
  <text start="2829.01" dur="4.65">more there was involved a lot more</text>
  <text start="2831.5" dur="4.29">people a lot more universities and the</text>
  <text start="2833.66" dur="5.939">CIA was hiding a lot of what was</text>
  <text start="2835.79" dur="5.85">actually happening imagine that the CIA</text>
  <text start="2839.599" dur="6.391">doing covert ops and not telling</text>
  <text start="2841.64" dur="6.42">Congress the truth about it so Q is</text>
  <text start="2845.99" dur="10.95">bringing this to our attention</text>
  <text start="2848.06" dur="11.34">for a reason and this is the video all</text>
  <text start="2856.94" dur="4.409">right so I&amp;#39;m going to play this video</text>
  <text start="2859.4" dur="3.6">and don&amp;#39;t worry about the sound it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2861.349" dur="5.281">just there&amp;#39;s a lot of wind noise in the</text>
  <text start="2863" dur="7.77">camera this is a presidential motorcade</text>
  <text start="2866.63" dur="5.52">coming down the road and in just a</text>
  <text start="2870.77" dur="3.69">minute you&amp;#39;re going to see a car come</text>

  <text start="2879.92" dur="7.07">concrete ditch and can&amp;#39;t get past it and</text>
  <text start="2882.589" dur="4.401">then they&amp;#39;re stopped by police</text>

  <text start="2897.71" dur="7.639">out taking video of the presidential</text>

  <text start="2967.6" dur="5.88">brakes weren&amp;#39;t working well this car is</text>
  <text start="2971.17" dur="4.19">up in the woods it&amp;#39;s not that a driveway</text>

  <text start="2978.97" dur="10.26">president&amp;#39;s car so there&amp;#39;s a reason</text>
  <text start="2982.06" dur="10.01">again why Q posted that cart and Q says</text>
  <text start="2989.23" dur="8.46">here you know this stringer is</text>
  <text start="2992.07" dur="10.27">suggesting that the CIA is using some</text>

  <text start="3759.42" dur="7.47">turned into a killer through programming</text>
  <text start="3761.91" dur="7.109">so art imitates life and no you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3766.89" dur="4.469">just flip a switch and turn somebody</text>
  <text start="3769.019" dur="4.731">into a killer you have to spend quite a</text>

  <text start="3818.46" dur="5.399">doing the research but that would</text>
  <text start="3821.579" dur="6.27">probably be interesting to find out why</text>
  <text start="3823.859" dur="6.51">was it classified well because if people</text>
  <text start="3827.849" dur="5.19">found out that you could use regular</text>

  <text start="4627.55" dur="7.949">13 russians have been indicted for</text>

  <text start="4651.459" dur="6.39">really funny thing is this essentially</text>
  <text start="4654.76" dur="4.919">this is a troll farm where Russian</text>
  <text start="4657.849" dur="4.17">people are on social media and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4659.679" dur="5.55">trying to express their opinions and</text>
  <text start="4662.019" dur="5.45">views and ideas on the election which is</text>

  <text start="4677.579" dur="7.33">Mahler decided to indict 13 Russians for</text>
  <text start="4681.13" dur="6.839">trying to get on social media and change</text>
  <text start="4684.909" dur="5.13">but what Rosenstein said here is with</text>
  <text start="4687.969" dur="5.911">these 13 indictments this is the</text>
  <text start="4690.039" dur="8.611">important part there is no allegation in</text>
  <text start="4693.88" dur="6.63">this indictment that any American was a</text>
  <text start="4698.65" dur="5.819">knowing participant in this activity</text>
  <text start="4700.51" dur="6.39">that means nobody on the Trump team not</text>
  <text start="4704.469" dur="6.541">President Trump not anyone on his team</text>
  <text start="4706.9" dur="9.96">was involved in any illegal activity</text>
  <text start="4711.01" dur="10.29">with respect to the election so yes that</text>
  <text start="4716.86" dur="7.17">means that the Muller investigation has</text>
  <text start="4721.3" dur="6.489">concluded there is no collusion</text>
  <text start="4724.03" dur="6.459">no illegal activity and no guilt on any</text>
  <text start="4727.789" dur="5.52">on the part of any American citizens</text>
  <text start="4730.489" dur="5.61">so essentially Muller has cleared Trump</text>
  <text start="4733.309" dur="5.971">and his team of any collusion and that</text>
