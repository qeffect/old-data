  <text start="1572.14" dur="6.69">specifically said 20 about 20 people in</text>
  <text start="1574.51" dur="7.78">the NSA now there was a question about</text>
  <text start="1578.83" dur="5.56">Mike Flynn and his name</text>
  <text start="1582.29" dur="5.06">massed and they said if it&amp;#39;s gonna come</text>
  <text start="1584.39" dur="7.89">to a level of somebody who is at a high</text>
  <text start="1587.35" dur="6.4">position of you know high power or</text>
  <text start="1592.28" dur="3.99">authority in the government it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1593.75" dur="5.49">going to go to a very high level in the</text>
  <text start="1596.27" dur="4.38">NSA probably Rogers or some right below</text>
  <text start="1599.24" dur="4.34">him only those people have the</text>
  <text start="1600.65" dur="5.13">authorization to unmask the name of</text>
  <text start="1603.58" dur="4.81">somebody else in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1605.78" dur="5.43">community or a federal judge for example</text>
  <text start="1608.39" dur="5.25">or a congressman that information being</text>
  <text start="1611.21" dur="5.16">amassed can only happen at a very high</text>
  <text start="1613.64" dur="10.11">level I&amp;#39;m not trying to bore you to</text>
  <text start="1616.37" dur="12.33">death this is important yeah so so what</text>
  <text start="1623.75" dur="8.96">we learned from that hearing is that the</text>
  <text start="1628.7" dur="7.35">government although the government does</text>
  <text start="1632.71" dur="5.17">routinely in which are yeah I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1636.05" dur="4.5">try to educate you about some terms</text>
  <text start="1637.88" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re going to see in the news and I</text>
  <text start="1640.55" dur="3.81">wanted to know what these terms mean so</text>
  <text start="1642.62" dur="5.19">one of the things coming out of this</text>
  <text start="1644.36" dur="6.33">hearing was that there was incidental</text>
  <text start="1647.81" dur="5.46">gathering of information okay this is</text>
  <text start="1650.69" dur="4.59">what people are saying now in the news</text>
  <text start="1653.27" dur="5.37">so that you know the intelligence was</text>
  <text start="1655.28" dur="3.81">gathered inside a deal there what that</text>
  <text start="1658.64" dur="3.6">means</text>
  <text start="1659.09" dur="6.36">what incidental means is we were doing</text>
  <text start="1662.24" dur="5.01">surveillance on person a and we</text>
  <text start="1665.45" dur="4.41">incidentally collected information on</text>
  <text start="1667.25" dur="4.08">person B they had a conversation because</text>
  <text start="1669.86" dur="3.75">I had a conversation they were the</text>
  <text start="1671.33" dur="7.29">target was a the incidental collection</text>
  <text start="1673.61" dur="6.69">was on B now unless person B and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1678.62" dur="3.99">what they do they give them a letter</text>
  <text start="1680.3" dur="6.96">they say this is person a this is person</text>
  <text start="1682.61" dur="8.37">B to keep them anonymous all right the</text>
  <text start="1687.26" dur="6.39">only way you can you can intentionally</text>
  <text start="1690.98" dur="4.47">gather information on person B if</text>
  <text start="1693.65" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re not the target is if you</text>
  <text start="1695.45" dur="6.3">suddenly realize they&amp;#39;re involved in a</text>
  <text start="1698.33" dur="5.91">serious crime with a felony then you can</text>
  <text start="1701.75" dur="6.63">you have probable cause and you can</text>
  <text start="1704.24" dur="6.69">start doing surveillance on person B all</text>
  <text start="1708.38" dur="5.22">right that&amp;#39;s how the process works for</text>
  <text start="1710.93" dur="4.84">gathering intelligence there are very</text>
  <text start="1713.6" dur="4.18">very strict law</text>
  <text start="1715.77" dur="7.8">about gathering intelligence on US</text>
  <text start="1717.78" dur="10.56">citizens you cannot routinely gather and</text>
  <text start="1723.57" dur="7.68">collect and information idea citizen you</text>
  <text start="1728.34" dur="5.219">can&amp;#39;t collect it and turn it around to</text>
  <text start="1731.25" dur="4.16">the other agencies yeah you can&amp;#39;t spread</text>
  <text start="1733.559" dur="5.911">out to other agencies and you cannot</text>
  <text start="1735.41" dur="7.06">unmask the identities the identities of</text>
  <text start="1739.47" dur="7.8">the people that are in this information</text>
  <text start="1742.47" dur="6.42">okay so I&amp;#39;m saying all this because what</text>

  <text start="2149.04" dur="10.17">that it was hacked by Russians okay now</text>
  <text start="2154.62" dur="6.02">here&amp;#39;s the interesting thing the same</text>
  <text start="2159.21" dur="5.7">company CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="2160.64" dur="9.82">evaluated military hardware owned by the</text>
  <text start="2164.91" dur="7.35">Ukrainian military when the you when the</text>
  <text start="2170.46" dur="3.33">Ukrainian military suffered some</text>
  <text start="2172.26" dur="5.72">devastating losses in their war with</text>
  <text start="2173.79" dur="9.48">with Russia CrowdStrike evaluated a</text>
  <text start="2177.98" dur="7.06">mobile app on a field artillery and said</text>
  <text start="2183.27" dur="11.04">it had been hacked by the Russians</text>
  <text start="2185.04" dur="11.13">now the Ukrainian commander and a number</text>
  <text start="2194.31" dur="5.52">of people in the Ukrainian government</text>
  <text start="2196.17" dur="5.4">when they read the report by CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="2199.83" dur="3.87">saying that it was hacked by the</text>
  <text start="2201.57" dur="3.27">Russians they said there&amp;#39;s no way this</text>
  <text start="2203.7" dur="3.96">could have been hacked by the Russians</text>
  <text start="2204.84" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s this ridiculous and they</text>
  <text start="2207.66" dur="5.94">gave a lot of good reasons why they</text>
  <text start="2209.61" dur="7.02">thought this report was erroneous this</text>
  <text start="2213.6" dur="5.16">same company CrowdStrike has reported</text>
  <text start="2216.63" dur="8.67">that the DNC server was hacked by the</text>
  <text start="2218.76" dur="11.34">Russians okay and and all 17</text>
  <text start="2225.3" dur="7.29">intelligence agencies in the u.s. agreed</text>
  <text start="2230.1" dur="4.83">with CrowdStrike that it was Russian</text>
  <text start="2232.59" dur="4.92">hacking even though none of them</text>
  <text start="2234.93" dur="5.16">inspected the server yeah they took</text>
  <text start="2237.51" dur="4.65">crowds they took crowd strikes work for</text>
  <text start="2240.09" dur="4.5">it and none of them investigated or</text>
  <text start="2242.16" dur="2.83">interrogated the log server logs or</text>
  <text start="2244.59" dur="2.76">anything</text>
  <text start="2244.99" dur="4.53">just said oh it has to be the Russians</text>
  <text start="2247.35" dur="3.46">we&amp;#39;re coming back to the Russian</text>
  <text start="2249.52" dur="4.88">narrative again there&amp;#39;s also a</text>
  <text start="2250.81" dur="5.72">connection between CrowdStrike and</text>
  <text start="2254.4" dur="7.18">commis brother</text>
  <text start="2256.53" dur="7.99">coby&amp;#39;s brother is a founder of a company</text>
  <text start="2261.58" dur="5.13">that is that does some work with</text>
  <text start="2264.52" dur="5.61">CrowdStrike so there&amp;#39;s like two degrees</text>
  <text start="2266.71" dur="7.47">of separation all right well what you</text>
  <text start="2270.13" dur="7.17">what you need to understand is that this</text>
  <text start="2274.18" dur="7.2">okay all right one of the things that</text>
  <text start="2277.3" dur="7.86">came out in WikiLeaks vault seven is the</text>
  <text start="2281.38" dur="6.72">fact that our intelligence community has</text>
  <text start="2285.16" dur="6.99">the ability to create malware and</text>
  <text start="2288.1" dur="5.94">viruses that can infect and invade</text>
  <text start="2292.15" dur="7.32">virtually any computer system in the</text>
  <text start="2294.04" dur="8.85">world and and they have gotten so sneaky</text>
  <text start="2299.47" dur="6.54">what they can do is they can take code</text>
  <text start="2302.89" dur="7.53">computer code from China from North</text>
  <text start="2306.01" dur="8.76">Korea from Russia from any country some</text>
  <text start="2310.42" dur="6.57">computer codes have bits of code that</text>
  <text start="2314.77" dur="4.74">are almost like fingerprints that</text>
  <text start="2316.99" dur="6.66">identify the country of origin now</text>
  <text start="2319.51" dur="8.43">here&amp;#39;s something to consider the NSA is</text>
  <text start="2323.65" dur="7.88">so good at creating viruses and malware</text>
  <text start="2327.94" dur="7.169">and software that they can create</text>
  <text start="2331.53" dur="7.06">malware that leaves no fingerprint at</text>
  <text start="2335.109" dur="6.181">all as to where it came from our</text>
  <text start="2338.59" dur="7.92">government our Intelligence Agency can</text>
  <text start="2341.29" dur="8.19">create software that completely erases</text>
  <text start="2346.51" dur="6.03">any hint of where it came from so when</text>
  <text start="2349.48" dur="7.01">we did the Stuxnet virus that was</text>
  <text start="2352.54" dur="7.47">responsible for taken down the Iranian</text>
  <text start="2356.49" dur="6.28">nuclear nuclear programs the centrifuges</text>
  <text start="2360.01" dur="4.8">we created a virus that basically blew</text>
  <text start="2362.77" dur="4.71">up the Iranian nuclear centrifuges so</text>
  <text start="2364.81" dur="7.65">that which delayed their ability to</text>
  <text start="2367.48" dur="8.97">produce enriched uranium well the virus</text>
  <text start="2372.46" dur="5.07">that we created was designed in such a</text>
  <text start="2376.45" dur="3.75">way that</text>
  <text start="2377.53" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re the Iranians never ever would</text>
  <text start="2380.2" dur="3.72">have been able to figure out it was that</text>
  <text start="2382.09" dur="4.83">it was there or where it came from</text>
  <text start="2383.92" dur="7.56">the problem came in that we and were</text>
  <text start="2386.92" dur="7.92">involved with Israel and Israel tweaked</text>
  <text start="2391.48" dur="5.43">the code and they created they added</text>
  <text start="2394.84" dur="5.37">some software to it that fingered it</text>
  <text start="2396.91" dur="5.4">back to Israel and us anyway a little</text>
  <text start="2400.21" dur="4.74">bit of rabbit hole but yeah that&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="2402.31" dur="4.83">the movie zero that&amp;#39;s in the movie zero</text>
  <text start="2404.95" dur="4.56">days if you have not seen the movie zero</text>
  <text start="2407.14" dur="6.66">days make sure you see it it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2409.51" dur="9.51">going back to CrowdStrike and the server</text>
  <text start="2413.8" dur="7.44">in Trump Tower okay think about this our</text>
  <text start="2419.02" dur="6.36">intelligence community has developed the</text>
  <text start="2421.24" dur="8.49">ability to create malware and viruses</text>
  <text start="2425.38" dur="7.74">and software that can not only hide the</text>
  <text start="2429.73" dur="7.07">source of origin but mimic another</text>
  <text start="2433.12" dur="6.48">source of origin so we can create</text>
  <text start="2436.8" dur="5.56">malware and viruses and software</text>
  <text start="2439.6" dur="8.1">programs that make it appear as if they</text>
  <text start="2442.36" dur="6.99">came from Russia yeah yes so that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2447.7" dur="6.18">coming so now we&amp;#39;re doing now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2449.35" dur="7.71">doing for DHS okay because the NSA can</text>
  <text start="2453.88" dur="5.64">create a virus and plant it on a</text>
  <text start="2457.06" dur="5.76">computer network in Iran and make it</text>
  <text start="2459.52" dur="7.44">appear as if Russia did it now think</text>
  <text start="2462.82" dur="6.75">about that what has been happening with</text>
  <text start="2466.96" dur="5.99">the server in Trump&amp;#39;s Tower it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2469.57" dur="6.45">communicating with two banks in Russia</text>
  <text start="2472.95" dur="5.17">SV Bank and alpha bank two Russian banks</text>
  <text start="2476.02" dur="4.71">and it&amp;#39;s been communicating to a third</text>
  <text start="2478.12" dur="5.4">source which is a healthcare network in</text>
  <text start="2480.73" dur="6.42">Michigan those are the only Internet</text>
  <text start="2483.52" dur="6.69">traffic sources that had been that were</text>
  <text start="2487.15" dur="5.58">being pinged on this server at Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2490.21" dur="6.45">Tower were two banks in Russia and one</text>
  <text start="2492.73" dur="5.82">healthcare network in Michigan no other</text>
  <text start="2496.66" dur="5.73">Internet traffic at all on the server at</text>
  <text start="2498.55" dur="6.18">Trump Tower and now it comes out the</text>
  <text start="2502.39" dur="6.66">fact that our intelligence community has</text>
  <text start="2504.73" dur="6.48">the ability to fake internet traffic</text>
  <text start="2509.05" dur="6.84">fake the origin</text>
  <text start="2511.21" dur="7.56">malware to basically make it appear that</text>
  <text start="2515.89" dur="5.07">any country in the world is doing the</text>
  <text start="2518.77" dur="6.42">surveillance and the planting the</text>
  <text start="2520.96" dur="7.29">viruses our NSA our Tony RCA could</text>
  <text start="2525.19" dur="6.74">easily set up a program on this server</text>
  <text start="2528.25" dur="6.51">and make it appear as if Russia was</text>
  <text start="2531.93" dur="7.69">communicating with this server when they</text>
  <text start="2534.76" dur="6.69">actually weren&amp;#39;t and then our Department</text>
  <text start="2539.62" dur="5.13">of Justice could go to a federal judge</text>
  <text start="2541.45" dur="5.94">and say we have computer logs that say</text>
  <text start="2544.75" dur="4.56">there&amp;#39;s a server in Trump Tower that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2547.39" dur="4.77">communicating with banks in Russia we</text>
  <text start="2549.31" dur="6">want abhorrent to gather their mail</text>
  <text start="2552.16" dur="6.36">surveillance on that Tower and it could</text>
  <text start="2555.31" dur="5.76">be a total lie it could be that the CIA</text>
  <text start="2558.52" dur="3.99">or the NSA set it up to make it appear</text>
  <text start="2561.07" dur="4.26">as if Russia was communicating with</text>
  <text start="2562.51" dur="7.11">Trump Tower and it never were this is</text>
  <text start="2565.33" dur="6.39">the level of deception that we are at</text>
  <text start="2569.62" dur="3.33">now with our intelligence community the</text>
  <text start="2571.72" dur="4.98">intelligence community can make it</text>
  <text start="2572.95" dur="6.51">appear as if your computer is talking to</text>
  <text start="2576.7" dur="6.09">a bank in Russia and they can then it</text>
  <text start="2579.46" dur="6.09">get a warrant to surveil you and gather</text>
  <text start="2582.79" dur="3.84">all of your information and make it look</text>
  <text start="2585.55" dur="3.27">as if you&amp;#39;re communicating with Russia</text>
  <text start="2586.63" dur="4.11">even though you never are you know what</text>
  <text start="2588.82" dur="9.3">else they can do we&amp;#39;re about to find out</text>
  <text start="2590.74" dur="12.11">hang on yeah there&amp;#39;s more so huge so all</text>
  <text start="2598.12" dur="9.42">right so we talked about crown strange</text>
  <text start="2602.85" dur="6.88">now let&amp;#39;s talk about there there is</text>
  <text start="2607.54" dur="5.85">slower a whistleblower whistleblowers</text>
  <text start="2609.73" dur="4.94">okay so there are people who are</text>
  <text start="2613.39" dur="5.58">ex-military</text>
  <text start="2614.67" dur="6.64">they are former intelligence contractors</text>
  <text start="2618.97" dur="4.77">or they&amp;#39;ve worked for NSA they&amp;#39;ve worked</text>
  <text start="2621.31" dur="4.62">for CIA most people know about Snowden</text>
  <text start="2623.74" dur="6.75">so right you know most people know about</text>
  <text start="2625.93" dur="8.4">Eric Snowden that this is Eric snow I</text>
  <text start="2630.49" dur="7.8">think that&amp;#39;s his name anyway there is</text>
  <text start="2634.33" dur="6.66">there is a significant group of people</text>
  <text start="2638.29" dur="6.39">who are former intelligence operative</text>
  <text start="2640.99" dur="4.3">former military and they know what our</text>
  <text start="2644.68" dur="4.33">intelligence</text>
  <text start="2645.29" dur="7.74">he&amp;#39;s doing and they are fed up with it</text>
  <text start="2649.01" dur="6.81">okay in the same way in the same way</text>
  <text start="2653.03" dur="6.18">that an anonymous FBI agent went</text>
  <text start="2655.82" dur="6.11">unfortune and was talking to the</text>
  <text start="2659.21" dur="7.11">anonymous community and telling them</text>
  <text start="2661.93" dur="7.36">there is widespread pedophile activity</text>
  <text start="2666.32" dur="5.01">in the FBI the CIA and they want it</text>
  <text start="2669.29" dur="3.45">stopped and we&amp;#39;re gonna give you some</text>
  <text start="2671.33" dur="4.5">information and you guys need to go</text>
  <text start="2672.74" dur="5.91">after it in the same way that there was</text>
  <text start="2675.83" dur="6.93">an FBI agent who wanted this expose guys</text>
  <text start="2678.65" dur="7.26">yeah good guys in the FBI there are good</text>
  <text start="2682.76" dur="7.74">people in the intelligence community who</text>
  <text start="2685.91" dur="5.55">want to blow the whistle to tell the</text>
  <text start="2690.5" dur="3.21">truth about what our intelligence</text>
  <text start="2691.46" dur="4.44">community is doing one of them is named</text>
  <text start="2693.71" dur="3.78">Dennis Montgomery write the name down</text>
  <text start="2695.9" dur="3.3">you&amp;#39;re gonna be hearing a lot about</text>
  <text start="2697.49" dur="3.75">Dennis Montgomery in that in the coming</text>
  <text start="2699.2" dur="4.62">months and you&amp;#39;ll also see that they</text>
  <text start="2701.24" dur="5.19">tried to discredit him in the past</text>
  <text start="2703.82" dur="4.53">right so no it&amp;#39;s coming for the</text>
  <text start="2706.43" dur="4.23">government and then they ended up</text>
  <text start="2708.35" dur="7.77">rehiring him after they said he was a</text>
  <text start="2710.66" dur="7.31">crook Montgomery has a colorful past yes</text>
  <text start="2716.12" dur="4.35">I&amp;#39;ll explain it we&amp;#39;re gonna be redundant</text>

  <text start="2720.47" dur="10.29">Montgomery Dennis Montgomery is a former</text>
  <text start="2727.37" dur="8.43">employee with National Security Agency</text>

  <text start="2807" dur="8.46">are already good at it right so when</text>
  <text start="2810.51" dur="8.73">this CIA finds you hacking a bank and</text>
  <text start="2815.46" dur="5.58">hacking into a computer network and</text>

  <text start="2895.23" dur="11.64">asked to create a computer system that</text>
  <text start="2900.33" dur="9.06">could get past passwords and firewalls</text>
  <text start="2906.87" dur="5.73">well they wanted to get in to catch</text>
  <text start="2909.39" dur="5.31">terrorists plotting things right</text>
  <text start="2912.6" dur="4.8">this is during a PCS during the Bush</text>
  <text start="2914.7" dur="5.55">Wars right and they thought you know if</text>
  <text start="2917.4" dur="7.08">we could get the emails and if we could</text>
  <text start="2920.25" dur="7.65">get into the websites of al Qaeda that</text>
  <text start="2924.48" dur="5.79">would be really helpful so they so</text>
  <text start="2927.9" dur="3">Montgomery said I can do that I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2930.27" dur="2.88">totally do that</text>
  <text start="2930.9" dur="6.63">so Montgomery wrote some programs that</text>
  <text start="2933.15" dur="6.57">would allow the CIA to hack into the</text>
  <text start="2937.53" dur="4.28">email accounts and the websites of al</text>
  <text start="2939.72" dur="5.06">Qaeda operatives and they were able to</text>
  <text start="2941.81" dur="4.78">kind of take down their websites and</text>
  <text start="2944.78" dur="3.61">infiltrate and figure out what they were</text>
  <text start="2946.59" dur="4.68">doing and get all their emails all right</text>
  <text start="2948.39" dur="4.43">all of the stuff always starts out with</text>
  <text start="2951.27" dur="6.03">a nobel-winning</text>
  <text start="2952.82" dur="6.85">objective and then it gets perverted so</text>
  <text start="2957.3" dur="4.8">they started out and that was that one</text>
  <text start="2959.67" dur="7.41">called dragnet no dragon was a giant</text>
  <text start="2962.1" dur="7.64">dragon is is later on yeah so they they</text>
  <text start="2967.08" dur="8.99">realized that they had the ability to</text>
  <text start="2969.74" dur="10.09">get past passwords and firewalls and</text>
  <text start="2976.07" dur="5.38">ways the security measures that people</text>
  <text start="2979.83" dur="3.72">put up to prevent you from getting into</text>
  <text start="2981.45" dur="6.54">websites and emails and that was that</text>
  <text start="2983.55" dur="7.08">system of just trying to root for its a</text>
  <text start="2987.99" dur="5.37">brute force yeah what they did was they</text>
  <text start="2990.63" dur="6.56">created these computers that could do</text>
  <text start="2993.36" dur="6.54">right on the order of like a million</text>
  <text start="2997.19" dur="4.93">possible password combinations in an</text>
  <text start="2999.9" dur="4.11">hour and they just tried millions of</text>
  <text start="3002.12" dur="5.25">combinations and eventually they would</text>
  <text start="3004.01" dur="5.64">by brute force just doing random numbers</text>
  <text start="3007.37" dur="5.04">they would get past your password and</text>
  <text start="3009.65" dur="12.39">get into your system okay brute force</text>
  <text start="3012.41" dur="12.48">attack well Montgomery was then asked by</text>
  <text start="3022.04" dur="9.57">all right Montgomery has kind of a kind</text>
  <text start="3024.89" dur="10.16">of a sketchy past he has been well I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3031.61" dur="7.98">say I&amp;#39;ll say that for later so</text>
  <text start="3035.05" dur="6.28">Montgomery is asked by clapper all right</text>
  <text start="3039.59" dur="4.71">now here&amp;#39;s the thing clapper and Bennett</text>
  <text start="3041.33" dur="3.98">so this years later now we&amp;#39;re into the</text>
  <text start="3044.3" dur="3.14">Obama administration</text>
  <text start="3045.31" dur="4.34">and there is a program developed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3047.44" dur="5.36">called dragnet all right</text>
  <text start="3049.65" dur="8.83">operation dragnet is a</text>
  <text start="3052.8" dur="8.65">intelligence-gathering program that is a</text>
  <text start="3058.48" dur="6.09">mass surveillance information gathering</text>
  <text start="3061.45" dur="6">program that just grabs information for</text>
  <text start="3064.57" dur="4.23">millions of people all right it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="3067.45" dur="4.71">around for a long time that&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="3068.8" dur="5.43">well known it&amp;#39;s not a big secret but</text>
  <text start="3072.16" dur="6.65">operation dragnet was sort of the</text>
  <text start="3074.23" dur="4.58">beginning of this surveillance program</text>
  <text start="3079.05" dur="8.86">they asked Montgomery if he could get in</text>
  <text start="3083.83" dur="5.97">they had a they had a criminal that they</text>
  <text start="3087.91" dur="6.69">were trying to prosecute and they wanted</text>
  <text start="3089.8" dur="7.26">his bank records and you know forget if</text>
  <text start="3094.6" dur="4.41">it was clapper or Brennan asked</text>
  <text start="3097.06" dur="4.77">Montgomery could you get into this Bank</text>
  <text start="3099.01" dur="3.75">I don&amp;#39;t know if it was a Bank of America</text>
  <text start="3101.83" dur="3.51">or some Bank</text>
  <text start="3102.76" dur="6.15">Citibank oh is Citibank that&amp;#39;s right I</text>
  <text start="3105.34" dur="5.64">know because I have a credit card and</text>
  <text start="3108.91" dur="2.28">Montgomery says yeah yeah well I&amp;#39;ll do</text>
  <text start="3110.98" dur="4.68">that</text>
  <text start="3111.19" dur="7.35">so Montgomery writes a program because</text>
  <text start="3115.66" dur="5.1">because initially they wanted to catch</text>
  <text start="3118.54" dur="4.17">the money that was going around yeah it</text>
  <text start="3120.76" dur="4.44">was it was money well terrorist it was</text>
  <text start="3122.71" dur="4.5">it was money laundering between</text>
  <text start="3125.2" dur="4.23">terrorists initially they were</text>
  <text start="3127.21" dur="3.63">terrorists they were taking money they</text>
  <text start="3129.43" dur="2.97">were doing money laundering and they</text>
  <text start="3130.84" dur="5">wanted to get the bank account</text>
  <text start="3132.4" dur="4.92">information to get proof that they were</text>
  <text start="3135.84" dur="4.54">laundering money</text>
  <text start="3137.32" dur="5.31">okay so Montgomery goes yeah we can do</text>
  <text start="3140.38" dur="6.45">that so he creates a program that hacks</text>
  <text start="3142.63" dur="6.48">into the database of a bank and they</text>
  <text start="3146.83" dur="6.99">download all the information they do it</text>
  <text start="3149.11" dur="6.84">so there undetected right what he did I</text>
  <text start="3153.82" dur="4.11">was going shut down in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="3155.95" dur="4.7">night he shut in the middle of the night</text>
  <text start="3157.93" dur="4.52">they hacked into the database of</text>
  <text start="3160.65" dur="5.32">Citibank</text>
  <text start="3162.45" dur="5.02">disabled the alarms and alerts that</text>
  <text start="3165.97" dur="6.06">would let them know there was a break-in</text>
  <text start="3167.47" dur="5.85">a security breach they were in there for</text>
  <text start="3172.03" dur="3.03">an hour they downloaded a bunch of</text>
  <text start="3173.32" dur="3.42">information and got out and then</text>
  <text start="3175.06" dur="3.08">reactivated all the security stuff</text>
  <text start="3176.74" dur="3.23">Citibank never knew</text>
  <text start="3178.14" dur="4.459">their database got hacked so now they</text>
  <text start="3179.97" dur="5.67">have bank account numbers of everyone</text>
  <text start="3182.599" dur="4.901">well hang on what happened what happened</text>
  <text start="3185.64" dur="4.5">first was they got the information on</text>
  <text start="3187.5" dur="4.89">the terrorists they Brennan and clapper</text>
  <text start="3190.14" dur="5.49">estin could you go in and get us more</text>
  <text start="3192.39" dur="4.169">information and Montgomery was like look</text>
  <text start="3195.63" dur="3.419">there&amp;#39;s a chance we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="3196.559" dur="3.841">caught if we do this and they were like</text>
  <text start="3199.049" dur="3.331">okay let&amp;#39;s just take the chance</text>
  <text start="3200.4" dur="4.5">I&amp;#39;m the chance of getting caught let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3202.38" dur="4.83">see if you can hack in and get a lot of</text>
  <text start="3204.9" dur="4.23">information so they did they went in and</text>
  <text start="3207.21" dur="6.26">they downloaded information for an hour</text>
  <text start="3209.13" dur="9.6">and then got out and came up with</text>
  <text start="3213.47" dur="8.17">thousands of names account numbers pin</text>
  <text start="3218.73" dur="4.77">numbers passwords and all the bank</text>
  <text start="3221.64" dur="7.949">account information for random people</text>
  <text start="3223.5" dur="9.079">that were members of Citibank okay you</text>
  <text start="3229.589" dur="2.99">see where this is going</text>
  <text start="3232.76" dur="7.599">they now have a program that has all</text>
  <text start="3238.65" dur="5.04">right and they said look can you do this</text>
  <text start="3240.359" dur="5.131">to another Wells Fargo can you do it to</text>
  <text start="3243.69" dur="3.78">Bank of America can you do to this Bank</text>
  <text start="3245.49" dur="2.309">in that thing and he goes yeah we can do</text>
  <text start="3247.47" dur="2.819">that</text>
  <text start="3247.799" dur="6.03">so they started hacking into the</text>
  <text start="3250.289" dur="7.08">databases of all his different banks and</text>

  <text start="3269.19" dur="4.77">mind this is not just surveillance but</text>
  <text start="3271.2" dur="4.94">this is hacking this is not surveillance</text>
  <text start="3273.96" dur="6.059">and identity this is not anything</text>
  <text start="3276.14" dur="5.5">identity by theft its identity theft but</text>
  <text start="3280.019" dur="3.81">we don&amp;#39;t know what they did with us</text>
  <text start="3281.64" dur="3.959">information gets into the hands of</text>
  <text start="3283.829" dur="3.78">somebody if somebody hacks their</text>

  <text start="4814.07" dur="5.339">things that Nunez is kind of aggravated</text>
  <text start="4816.86" dur="8.78">about is two years of year and a half</text>
  <text start="4819.409" dur="10.201">ago the CIA was under a Senate oversight</text>
  <text start="4825.64" dur="6.16">for some illegal activities including</text>

  <text start="4845.14" dur="5.019">Senate Intelligence Committee there and</text>
  <text start="4847.489" dur="3.891">they backed onto the phone conversations</text>
  <text start="4850.159" dur="4.711">and they hacked into the database</text>
  <text start="4851.38" dur="4.69">illegally and when the Senate members of</text>
  <text start="4854.87" dur="4.65">the sent intelligence committee found</text>
  <text start="4856.07" dur="6.66">out that the CIA was surveilling them</text>

  <text start="4862.73" dur="4.679">off and they were never came in I mean</text>
  <text start="4865.64" dur="4.95">nothing yet nothing ever came of it but</text>
  <text start="4867.409" dur="5.671">there was this war between the CIA and</text>
  <text start="4870.59" dur="4.68">the Senate Intelligence Committee which</text>
  <text start="4873.08" dur="5.28">oversees them and is responsible for</text>
  <text start="4875.27" dur="5.55">funding them and authorizing everything</text>

  <text start="4880.82" dur="5.07">responsible for oversight and funding an</text>
  <text start="4884.36" dur="3.81">organization like the CIA that is</text>
  <text start="4885.89" dur="6.12">messing with everything that you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="4906.33" dur="3.69">already</text>
  <text start="4906.96" dur="5.46">he&amp;#39;s naive but obviously he found out</text>
  <text start="4910.02" dur="5.31">that he and other members of Congress</text>
  <text start="4912.42" dur="5.64">are having all of their phone records</text>

  <text start="5194.11" dur="4.71">created these very powerful tools to</text>
  <text start="5196.809" dur="5.43">stop terrorism but now they&amp;#39;re using it</text>
  <text start="5198.82" dur="5.549">against citizens yeah and now it seems</text>
  <text start="5202.239" dur="5.781">like this is all gonna have to come out</text>
  <text start="5204.369" dur="7.051">I&amp;#39;m sure that the media and the</text>
  <text start="5208.02" dur="10.3">Democrats will try to spin it as much as</text>
  <text start="5211.42" dur="10.429">they possibly can but well you know</text>

  <text start="5241.09" dur="3.719">gas right they have to you have to have</text>
  <text start="5243.13" dur="2.969">a copy of it somewhere in case the FBI</text>
  <text start="5244.809" dur="5.79">decides they&amp;#39;re not going to do anything</text>

  <text start="5277.289" dur="9.551">this is going to this is going to</text>
  <text start="5281.099" dur="8.83">implicate a lot of people because when</text>
  <text start="5286.84" dur="7.679">it comes to high-level US citizens like</text>

  <text start="5514.64" dur="6.68">things some kind of Russian connect</text>
  <text start="5516.2" dur="8.82">right so new FBI typically does not</text>

  <text start="5545.47" dur="6.85">Congress know that there was an ongoing</text>
  <text start="5548.57" dur="5.46">investigation on Donald Trump now the</text>
  <text start="5552.32" dur="4.2">interesting thing is he would not</text>
  <text start="5554.03" dur="3.84">confirm whether or not there was an</text>
  <text start="5556.52" dur="4.41">investigation into the</text>

  <text start="5565.07" dur="5.07">an investigation of Donald Trump and</text>
  <text start="5566.57" dur="6.41">when he was asked Comey was asked how</text>
  <text start="5570.14" dur="4.95">long is this investigation gonna go on</text>
  <text start="5572.98" dur="5.02">you say well you know we don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="5575.09" dur="5.61">know it&amp;#39;s hard to tell you know where it</text>
  <text start="5578" dur="4.17">goes Mike against yourself that well the</text>
  <text start="5580.7" dur="4.68">investigations been going on since at</text>
  <text start="5582.17" dur="5.73">least June we know that because he they</text>
  <text start="5585.38" dur="5.88">asked him where Dan 2000 and it began in</text>
  <text start="5587.9" dur="8.87">June of last year here&amp;#39;s the thing that</text>
  <text start="5591.26" dur="8.64">you need to remember about two weeks ago</text>
  <text start="5596.77" dur="7.9">Andrew McCabe who is the Deputy Director</text>
  <text start="5599.9" dur="7.82">of the FBI you&amp;#39;re under Comey went to</text>
  <text start="5604.67" dur="6.6">the White House and told Reince Priebus</text>
  <text start="5607.72" dur="6.45">there is we&amp;#39;ve been investigating Trump</text>
  <text start="5611.27" dur="6.47">and there is no evidence of Russian</text>
  <text start="5614.17" dur="8.71">collision okay</text>
  <text start="5617.74" dur="7.24">McCabe told the White House already we</text>
  <text start="5622.88" dur="4.62">know there is no evidence of collusion</text>
  <text start="5624.98" dur="4.14">and you know that if there was they</text>
  <text start="5627.5" dur="2.7">would have really showed us that</text>
  <text start="5629.12" dur="3.69">evidence by now</text>
  <text start="5630.2" dur="4.11">Oh started back in June and they wanted</text>
  <text start="5632.81" dur="3.72">to keep him from becoming princess</text>
  <text start="5634.31" dur="3.63">negation as we go now for nine months if</text>
  <text start="5636.53" dur="5.01">there was any collusion that would have</text>
  <text start="5637.94" dur="7.56">found it already so effectively the</text>
  <text start="5641.54" dur="7.11">FBI&amp;#39;s investigation is over Andrew</text>
  <text start="5645.5" dur="5.22">McCabe already told Reince Priebus they</text>
  <text start="5648.65" dur="3.66">told the White House there is no</text>
  <text start="5650.72" dur="3.69">evidence of collusion they wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="5652.31" dur="4.11">said that if the investigation was over</text>
  <text start="5654.41" dur="4.11">but they wouldn&amp;#39;t come out to the media</text>
  <text start="5656.42" dur="4.35">with for the course for the purposes of</text>
  <text start="5658.52" dur="4.17">the public hearing of course they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="5660.77" dur="4.05">going to say the investigations over but</text>
  <text start="5662.69" dur="4.59">effectively it is we know that already</text>
  <text start="5664.82" dur="6.3">because McCabe said we don&amp;#39;t we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5667.28" dur="5.13">find anything so company will continue</text>
  <text start="5671.12" dur="5.67">to play this game</text>
  <text start="5672.41" dur="6.9">as long as you can but they&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="6127.93" dur="5.32">the Democrats are in are out of power</text>
  <text start="6131.63" dur="4.44">they don&amp;#39;t have the votes to stop</text>
  <text start="6133.25" dur="6.51">anything you know the only reason why</text>
  <text start="6136.07" dur="8.04">the health care bill got pulled today so</text>
  <text start="6139.76" dur="7.02">Paul Ryan was going to take his health</text>

  <text start="6146.78" dur="3.99">have a vote on it and he pulled it and</text>
  <text start="6149.3" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re probably going to vote next week</text>
  <text start="6150.77" dur="5.07">on it because they didn&amp;#39;t have the votes</text>
  <text start="6153.83" dur="4.98">it doesn&amp;#39;t matter the Democrat votes</text>
  <text start="6155.84" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s Republican votes Republicans have a</text>
  <text start="6158.81" dur="3.87">majority in the House and Senate it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6160.85" dur="4.8">really only the Republican votes that</text>
  <text start="6162.68" dur="5.28">matter and in in on the health care bill</text>
  <text start="6165.65" dur="4.74">there is the freedom caucus and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6167.96" dur="4.17">different groups of Republicans and they</text>
  <text start="6170.39" dur="6.12">could not get enough votes from</text>
  <text start="6172.13" dur="7.23">Republicans to pass this bill so they</text>
  <text start="6176.51" dur="4.89">never brought it up for vote but because</text>
  <text start="6179.36" dur="3.77">the moderate Republicans want one thing</text>
  <text start="6181.4" dur="3.99">and they&amp;#39;re very conservative</text>
  <text start="6183.13" dur="4.18">Republicans well you know something else</text>
  <text start="6185.39" dur="7.44">you know we personally would like to see</text>
  <text start="6187.31" dur="8.28">them just get rid of Ryan&amp;#39;s bill and let</text>
  <text start="6192.83" dur="5.07">Rand Paul put put out his health care</text>
  <text start="6195.59" dur="5.34">bill it&amp;#39;s five pages that doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="6197.9" dur="5.16">now it doesn&amp;#39;t it doesn&amp;#39;t me do pass and</text>
  <text start="6200.93" dur="3.63">the other problem is Rand Paul is in the</text>
  <text start="6203.06" dur="5.28">Senate and this has to go to the house</text>
  <text start="6204.56" dur="5.7">and how do you get Rand Paul&amp;#39;s Senate</text>
  <text start="6208.34" dur="4.53">bill to be accepted in that house I</text>
  <text start="6210.26" dur="3.84">don&amp;#39;t know the health care bill is going</text>
  <text start="6212.87" dur="4.13">to be an issue but you have to</text>
  <text start="6214.1" dur="5.28">understand Republicans are in control</text>
  <text start="6217" dur="4.48">they control the house they control the</text>
  <text start="6219.38" dur="3.87">Senate and they control the White House</text>
  <text start="6221.48" dur="4.89">so Democrats all they can do is stall</text>
  <text start="6223.25" dur="6.239">they have no voice in what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="6226.37" dur="5.73">unfortunately for them and they&amp;#39;re there</text>

  <text start="6354.11" dur="5.49">your premiums had started out at $400 a</text>

  <text start="6362.27" dur="7.409">didn&amp;#39;t tell you that because Obamacare</text>
  <text start="6366.23" dur="8.699">was designed to become very expensive at</text>
  <text start="6369.679" dur="7.321">the end because in 2016 they expected</text>
  <text start="6374.929" dur="4.861">Hillary Clinton to be president and then</text>
  <text start="6377" dur="5.13">she would come in they plenteous koyama</text>
  <text start="6379.79" dur="5.79">payer government system they planned it</text>
  <text start="6382.13" dur="6.69">all out ten days before the election</text>
  <text start="6385.58" dur="4.11">they figured Hillary was going to be</text>
  <text start="6388.82" dur="4.14">elected</text>
  <text start="6389.69" dur="6.33">so they announced what the what the</text>
  <text start="6392.96" dur="5.969">premiums are going to be and when people</text>
  <text start="6396.02" dur="6.949">found out in Pennsylvania and Michigan</text>
  <text start="6398.929" dur="6.151">and Ohio and Florida that the Obamacare</text>
  <text start="6402.969" dur="5.411">increases increases are going to go</text>
  <text start="6405.08" dur="7.139">sky-high though do you not think that</text>
  <text start="6408.38" dur="8.16">that flipped a few votes they did not</text>
  <text start="6412.219" dur="6.75">anticipate that the announcement of</text>
  <text start="6416.54" dur="6.21">Obamacare insurance if premiums increase</text>
  <text start="6418.969" dur="4.891">was going to change votes and I suspect</text>
  <text start="6422.75" dur="3.179">that some people found out that</text>
  <text start="6423.86" dur="7.17">Obamacare was going to start to hammer</text>
  <text start="6425.929" dur="6.96">people all right say what and Trump was</text>
  <text start="6431.03" dur="5.04">saying we&amp;#39;re gonna repeal and replace</text>
  <text start="6432.889" dur="4.98">Obamacare in 2016 people really started</text>
  <text start="6436.07" dur="3.299">to figure out Obamacare was good it was</text>
  <text start="6437.869" dur="4.611">going to mess up a lot of people and</text>
  <text start="6439.369" dur="6.631">it&amp;#39;s only going to get worse if</text>
  <text start="6442.48" dur="6.219">Obamacare is not repealed the insurance</text>
  <text start="6446" dur="5.909">premiums continue to get worse higher</text>
  <text start="6448.699" dur="5.161">and higher and what&amp;#39;s happening is a lot</text>
  <text start="6451.909" dur="3.571">of like at an Arizona I think there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6453.86" dur="5.19">only one insurance company that&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="6455.48" dur="5.85">in Arizona on the exchanges so it was</text>
  <text start="6459.05" dur="5.819">designed to fail because they thought</text>
  <text start="6461.33" dur="5.309">Hillary would be elected in 2016</text>
  <text start="6464.869" dur="4.441">she would come in get rid of Obamacare</text>
  <text start="6466.639" dur="4.471">and make it a single-payer system which</text>
  <text start="6469.31" dur="3.39">is what they wanted from the beginning</text>
  <text start="6471.11" dur="3.56">by the government alright only right</text>
  <text start="6472.7" dur="6.27">over our insurance used to be around</text>
  <text start="6474.67" dur="7.15">$600 for the two of us now it&amp;#39;s 1151</text>
  <text start="6478.97" dur="4.68">dollars a month it&amp;#39;s not in the exchange</text>
  <text start="6481.82" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re not on a well macare that&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="6483.65" dur="6.92">private insurance we couldn&amp;#39;t get any</text>
  <text start="6485.39" dur="7.14">kind of subsidy anyway so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="6490.57" dur="4.66">unsustainable I don&amp;#39;t know how we can</text>
  <text start="6492.53" dur="5.7">keep insurance if they let this continue</text>
  <text start="6495.23" dur="5.93">but anyway somebody asked about the wiki</text>
  <text start="6498.23" dur="8.76">leaks today announcement from Assange</text>
  <text start="6501.16" dur="8.2">right very dark matter products that are</text>
  <text start="6506.99" dur="5.34">infected with right now we&amp;#39;re from well</text>
  <text start="6509.36" dur="7.05">what you have to know about vault 7 so</text>
  <text start="6512.33" dur="7.16">far part 1 and part 2 is that Julian</text>
  <text start="6516.41" dur="8.73">Assange and WikiLeaks they&amp;#39;re releasing</text>
  <text start="6519.49" dur="8.5">information to consumers letting them</text>
  <text start="6525.14" dur="5.34">know that there are vulnerabilities in</text>
  <text start="6527.99" dur="6.06">the software for your phones your</text>
  <text start="6530.48" dur="5.91">computer&amp;#39;s your laptop&amp;#39;s your TVs that</text>
  <text start="6534.05" dur="5.55">all the software that&amp;#39;s been created to</text>
  <text start="6536.39" dur="5.4">run those devices have vulnerabilities</text>
  <text start="6539.6" dur="6.84">in them that the government is</text>
  <text start="6541.79" dur="9.6">exploiting in fact when when Assange</text>
  <text start="6546.44" dur="7.62">released vault 7 part 1 Edward Snowden</text>
  <text start="6551.39" dur="4.68">started going through it reading all the</text>
  <text start="6554.06" dur="4.11">information that was in vault 7 and</text>
  <text start="6556.07" dur="4.91">Snowden said it looks like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6558.17" dur="6.11">evidence that the government has paid</text>
  <text start="6560.98" dur="5.2">software manufacturers to create</text>
  <text start="6564.28" dur="5.26">vulnerabilities that the government</text>
  <text start="6566.18" dur="6.9">could exploit I&amp;#39;m going to say that</text>
  <text start="6569.54" dur="6.95">again and word Snowden said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6573.08" dur="6.23">evidence that the government paid</text>
  <text start="6576.49" dur="4.95">software companies to create</text>
  <text start="6579.31" dur="6.91">vulnerabilities which they could exploit</text>
  <text start="6581.44" dur="7">so what vault 7 tells you is that all</text>
  <text start="6586.22" dur="4.65">the operating systems for your</text>
  <text start="6588.44" dur="5.3">computer&amp;#39;s your laptops desktops your</text>

  <text start="6595.7" dur="6.53">that the government and other hackers</text>
  <text start="6598.58" dur="6.47">from China and Iran</text>

  <text start="6612.67" dur="5.55">information you know Adam Adam Gingrich</text>
  <text start="6616.96" dur="3.78">actually made a really good point he</text>
  <text start="6618.22" dur="5.88">said you know it&amp;#39;s unfortunate that the</text>

  <text start="6653.35" dur="6.69">cyber security threat is China China is</text>
  <text start="6656.08" dur="7.77">a much more real threat to our security</text>
  <text start="6660.04" dur="6.57">than Russia is in many ways China</text>
  <text start="6663.85" dur="5.43">controls the South China Sea the</text>

  <text start="6733.52" dur="4.56">but it&amp;#39;s actually physical the missile</text>
  <text start="6736.67" dur="2.94">alright Bernadette you asked a really</text>
  <text start="6738.08" dur="3.81">good question what about the missile</text>
  <text start="6739.61" dur="4.32">from North Korea oh right this is</text>
  <text start="6741.89" dur="4.56">something that Adam talked about on one</text>
  <text start="6743.93" dur="5.25">of his periscopes gosh probably a month</text>
  <text start="6746.45" dur="4.8">ago I did not know this but see Adam</text>
  <text start="6749.18" dur="3.18">works in government right he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="6751.25" dur="3.24">politics he knows his stuff</text>
  <text start="6752.36" dur="4.83">he said look we did not have to worry</text>
  <text start="6754.49" dur="4.2">about North Korea hitting the west coast</text>
  <text start="6757.19" dur="3.62">of the United States with a missile it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6758.69" dur="4.98">not going to happen ever</text>
  <text start="6760.81" dur="6.55">all right if you live in Washington or</text>
  <text start="6763.67" dur="5.7">British Columbia or Oregon or California</text>
  <text start="6767.36" dur="5.04">you do not need to worry about kim</text>
  <text start="6769.37" dur="5.01">jeong-hoon hitting you with a missile</text>
  <text start="6772.4" dur="9.42">from North Korea you want to know why</text>
  <text start="6774.38" dur="12.66">because we have hacked the codes for all</text>
  <text start="6781.82" dur="9.24">North Korean missiles we have our people</text>
  <text start="6787.04" dur="7.92">in NSA and CIA are very smart people</text>
  <text start="6791.06" dur="6.42">they have the codes for all of the</text>
  <text start="6794.96" dur="5.85">software and all the programming on all</text>
  <text start="6797.48" dur="6.09">the missiles in North Korea alright so</text>
  <text start="6800.81" dur="5.19">we can&amp;#39;t say that out we&amp;#39;re not supposed</text>
  <text start="6803.57" dur="5.04">to say that so don&amp;#39;t tell anybody but we</text>
  <text start="6806" dur="4.86">have the we have the codes we we have</text>
  <text start="6808.61" dur="3.87">people in our intelligence community who</text>
  <text start="6810.86" dur="4.74">are monitoring North Korea&amp;#39;s missile</text>
  <text start="6812.48" dur="4.86">launches if North Korea ever decides to</text>
  <text start="6815.6" dur="4.34">launch an actual missile that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="6817.34" dur="6.33">dangerous somebody in Langley Virginia</text>
  <text start="6819.94" dur="5.83">is going to flip a little switch and</text>
  <text start="6823.67" dur="4.14">that missile is going to go into the sea</text>
  <text start="6825.77" dur="4.44">or explode as soon as it leaves a launch</text>
  <text start="6827.81" dur="3.69">pad that&amp;#39;s actually what happened with</text>
  <text start="6830.21" dur="3.33">the North Korean missile launch the</text>
  <text start="6831.5" dur="4.38">other night remember it said that a</text>
  <text start="6833.54" dur="5.34">missile exploded right after it left the</text>
  <text start="6835.88" dur="7.53">launch pad how did it just exploded well</text>
  <text start="6838.88" dur="6.66">how did that happen well Adam told us</text>
  <text start="6843.41" dur="5.04">that we have the ability to control so</text>
  <text start="6845.54" dur="4.62">does China China has China their</text>
  <text start="6848.45" dur="4.67">engineers are smart their software</text>
  <text start="6850.16" dur="7.53">people are smart they have the codes for</text>
  <text start="6853.12" dur="6.84">North Korea&amp;#39;s missiles too so China when</text>
  <text start="6857.69" dur="5.04">kim jeong-hoon launches a missile</text>
  <text start="6859.96" dur="4.27">somebody in China can divert that</text>
  <text start="6862.73" dur="3.339">missile and make sure it goes right into</text>
  <text start="6864.23" dur="3.819">the sea or explodes after him</text>
  <text start="6866.069" dur="6.23">after launches we can do the same thing</text>
  <text start="6868.049" dur="6.87">we have our look this is global and</text>
  <text start="6872.299" dur="5.38">security and intelligence on my iPhone</text>
  <text start="6874.919" dur="5.25">well they can just shut up this is</text>
  <text start="6877.679" dur="4.98">global security intelligence okay</text>
  <text start="6880.169" dur="5.1">when intercontinental ballistic missiles</text>
  <text start="6882.659" dur="5.39">became a reality our intelligence</text>
  <text start="6885.269" dur="6.21">community had to make sure we had</text>
  <text start="6888.049" dur="7.39">software and we had hacking programs and</text>
  <text start="6891.479" dur="6.21">we had access to other people&amp;#39;s ICBMs so</text>
  <text start="6895.439" dur="3.93">that if they try to launch something at</text>
  <text start="6897.689" dur="5.071">us we could destroy it before it got</text>
  <text start="6899.369" dur="5.88">here we have that technology we can</text>
  <text start="6902.76" dur="4.529">destroy the missiles of almost any</text>
  <text start="6905.249" dur="6.33">country if they come toward us</text>
  <text start="6907.289" dur="6.3">unless Russia parks a submarine off of</text>
  <text start="6911.579" dur="3.9">the coast and launches a missile you</text>
  <text start="6913.589" dur="3.06">know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the only way they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="6915.479" dur="2.61">gonna hit it they&amp;#39;re not gonna hit us</text>
  <text start="6916.649" dur="2.22">from a land-based missile launch it&amp;#39;s</text>
