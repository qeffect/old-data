  <text start="166.92" dur="6.12">research board Q research now when Q</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="5.19">posts a message on Q research that is an</text>
  <text start="173.04" dur="3.75">open board that anyone can go on they</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="5.19">can observe the post and they can also</text>
  <text start="176.79" dur="6.39">leave comments when Q posts on Patriots</text>
  <text start="180.39" dur="5.58">fight Patriots fight is a closed board</text>
  <text start="183.18" dur="9.96">as read-only you can&amp;#39;t respond to any of</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="11.73">Q&amp;#39;s posts on Patriots fight so just to</text>
  <text start="193.14" dur="7.71">clarify so Q can post on both boards the</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="5.52">websites that pull queues posts from</text>
  <text start="200.85" dur="5.73">those two boards on hm aggregate them</text>
  <text start="203.22" dur="6.36">onto a single website whether it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="206.58" dur="5.28">I said Q Anand pub or q map pub there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="209.58" dur="4.59">a lot of other sites I have five or six</text>
  <text start="211.86" dur="4.26">different sites that I use to track the</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="6.9">Q suppose they all pull the posts from</text>
  <text start="216.12" dur="9.15">the boards periodically okay so these</text>
  <text start="221.07" dur="6.84">posts Q put up on Patriots fight and</text>
  <text start="225.27" dur="6">then remove them q does periodically</text>
  <text start="227.91" dur="5.85">remove posts that&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="231.27" dur="6.06">unusual about that but what happened I</text>
  <text start="233.76" dur="5.61">think when I understand this is if you</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="5.76">have the Q map app or if you have Q</text>
  <text start="239.37" dur="7.05">Alerts these posts that were missing</text>
  <text start="243.09" dur="5.31">that didn&amp;#39;t get pulled when Q originally</text>
  <text start="246.42" dur="5.55">posted them somebody manually put them</text>
  <text start="248.4" dur="6.99">back on the website last night this post</text>
  <text start="251.97" dur="8.06">with the three and the DG and the 1-2 H</text>
  <text start="255.39" dur="8.25">was not there previously neither was</text>
  <text start="260.03" dur="6.4">this post here so I think people were</text>
  <text start="263.64" dur="3.9">getting notifications of new posts last</text>
  <text start="266.43" dur="3.15">night because these</text>
  <text start="267.54" dur="5.55">posts were being added in manually</text>
  <text start="269.58" dur="6.54">because cute posted him removed them</text>
  <text start="273.09" dur="5.84">didn&amp;#39;t get picked up and then somebody</text>
  <text start="276.12" dur="5.67">who is working with this website</text>
  <text start="278.93" dur="3.82">manually added those posts and I think</text>
  <text start="281.79" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s why people are getting</text>
  <text start="282.75" dur="3.78">notifications last night we got</text>
  <text start="284.73" dur="3.96">notifications on the queue app I think</text>
  <text start="286.53" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s because they were inserting putting</text>
  <text start="288.69" dur="5.46">these posts into the thread and people</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="2.46">were looking for notifications for new</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="5.96">posts and I didn&amp;#39;t find them because</text>
  <text start="295.2" dur="7.44">these are being added manually alright I</text>
  <text start="300.11" dur="4.24">just wanted to clear some of that up</text>
