  <text start="1369.88" dur="4.47">net worth is over 40 million and we know</text>
  <text start="1372.73" dur="3.24">Obama signed a book deal and according</text>
  <text start="1374.35" dur="4.53">to Breitbart they said that book deal</text>
  <text start="1375.97" dur="4.92">was estimated estimated to be worth 65</text>
  <text start="1378.88" dur="4.5">million dollars now this was a book deal</text>
  <text start="1380.89" dur="4.529">signed in 2017 right</text>
  <text start="1383.38" dur="4.44">Obama had previously written a book in</text>
  <text start="1385.419" dur="3.691">2009 and Michelle also wrote a book that</text>
  <text start="1387.82" dur="3.989">has been on the New York Times</text>
  <text start="1389.11" dur="4.38">bestseller I was wrong so Q has been</text>
  <text start="1391.809" dur="3.961">putting a laser pointer on this book</text>
  <text start="1393.49" dur="5.58">delish and this is July 8th right</text>
  <text start="1395.77" dur="5.22">Trump then a couple of days ago starts</text>
  <text start="1399.07" dur="5.01">talking about Obama&amp;#39;s book steal right</text>
  <text start="1400.99" dur="5.91">right so why was Q talking about Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1404.08" dur="4.349">book deal July 8th three weeks ago and</text>
  <text start="1406.9" dur="4.38">now all of a sudden Trump is hammering</text>
  <text start="1408.429" dur="5.101">the Obama book deals right and so this</text>
  <text start="1411.28" dur="4.05">is sort of what the the I think one of</text>
  <text start="1413.53" dur="3.66">the the more interesting and fun things</text>
  <text start="1415.33" dur="4.079">about the Q drops right because you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1417.19" dur="5.369">got the people to go they&amp;#39;re dismissive</text>
  <text start="1419.409" dur="5.52">of this information right but as you</text>
  <text start="1422.559" dur="5.011">mentioned the this isn&amp;#39;t the first time</text>
  <text start="1424.929" dur="4.891">this has happened a lot where the queue</text>
  <text start="1427.57" dur="4.29">drops will reference things that are</text>
  <text start="1429.82" dur="5.729">extremely relevant and very important</text>
  <text start="1431.86" dur="6.179">and they are dismissed by those that I</text>
  <text start="1435.549" dur="4.37">think are trying to keep a lid on it and</text>
  <text start="1438.039" dur="4.681">then President Trump will reference</text>
  <text start="1439.919" dur="4.481">information out of the blue that is in a</text>
  <text start="1442.72" dur="4.02">queue dropped from three weeks ago Q</text>
  <text start="1444.4" dur="5.43">first started suggesting that Dan Coates</text>
  <text start="1446.74" dur="4.46">was a black hat in February well there</text>
  <text start="1449.83" dur="3.839">you go</text>
  <text start="1451.2" dur="4.69">and we&amp;#39;ve had multiple posts since</text>
  <text start="1453.669" dur="4.441">February suggesting that Dan Coates is a</text>
  <text start="1455.89" dur="4.59">black hat and he is on his way out right</text>
  <text start="1458.11" dur="4.199">and this week we get news Oh Dan Coates</text>
  <text start="1460.48" dur="4.62">is a black hat musical evening right</text>
  <text start="1462.309" dur="4.711">right so you know if you follow the</text>
  <text start="1465.1" dur="3.569">queue drops sometimes you&amp;#39;ll get</text>
  <text start="1467.02" dur="3.06">information wait ahead of time before it</text>
  <text start="1468.669" dur="2.76">hits the news right well and that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="1470.08" dur="2.79">think the challenge too is with this</text>
  <text start="1471.429" dur="3.63">type of information because the way it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1472.87" dur="5.07">delivered you have to have a certain</text>
  <text start="1475.059" dur="4.771">level of patience with it because you</text>
  <text start="1477.94" dur="2.32">don&amp;#39;t know where in time this fits in</text>
  <text start="1479.83" dur="1.99">you</text>
  <text start="1480.26" dur="4.11">awaring time it fits into the narrative</text>
  <text start="1481.82" dur="3.63">or when you&amp;#39;re going to need it and I</text>
  <text start="1484.37" dur="4.26">think that&amp;#39;s one of the more interesting</text>
  <text start="1485.45" dur="5.04">aspects of it is that if there is it is</text>
  <text start="1488.63" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s like taking like this this</text>
  <text start="1490.49" dur="3.32">corruption is so massive right Dave like</text>
  <text start="1492.47" dur="4.08">we sat down if you and I did a show</text>
  <text start="1493.81" dur="4.21">every day for a year we still probably</text>
  <text start="1496.55" dur="4.26">wouldn&amp;#39;t cover all of it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1498.02" dur="5.28">got it&amp;#39;s that big in the pervasive</text>
  <text start="1500.81" dur="4.44">there&amp;#39;s over 3,500 posts on the board so</text>
  <text start="1503.3" dur="4.62">far and they cover hundreds and hundreds</text>
  <text start="1505.25" dur="5.79">languages and in that way what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1507.92" dur="6.66">saying is it&amp;#39;s a 60-hour a job right I</text>
  <text start="1511.04" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t know we for me to research right</text>
  <text start="1514.58" dur="3.99">aggregate all the drops compare</text>
  <text start="1516.71" dur="4.65">everything pull out the old ones look at</text>
  <text start="1518.57" dur="4.08">the new ones it&amp;#39;s a full-time job what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1521.36" dur="6.99">amazing about that though is to your</text>
  <text start="1522.65" dur="7.38">point 3,500 drops in it took 3,500 and</text>

  <text start="2337.46" dur="4.38">look the way I&amp;#39;m interpreting that is</text>

  <text start="2351.02" dur="4.05">kind of like we don&amp;#39;t see a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="2352.79" dur="3.75">evidence to suggest in a prove that</text>
  <text start="2355.07" dur="2.91">Chris Ray is deep state even though a</text>
  <text start="2356.54" dur="2.79">lot of people have been accusing him and</text>
  <text start="2357.98" dur="3.84">we do know we have some evidence that</text>
  <text start="2359.33" dur="4.05">he&amp;#39;s been doing his job at least in some</text>
  <text start="2361.82" dur="3.39">regards which is look at all the people</text>
  <text start="2363.38" dur="4.26">who all fired from the FBI fired a bunch</text>
  <text start="2365.21" dur="4.41">of corrupt people and implemented the</text>
  <text start="2367.64" dur="3.57">leaks clogging you know plugging all</text>
  <text start="2369.62" dur="3.84">those leaks he&amp;#39;s the one who changed the</text>
  <text start="2371.21" dur="3.75">the rules at the FBI for them going</text>
  <text start="2373.46" dur="3.24">after their own people easing their own</text>
  <text start="2374.96" dur="4.89">people regarding leaks to journalists</text>
  <text start="2376.7" dur="4.65">and stuff so he&amp;#39;s done work and Chris</text>
  <text start="2379.85" dur="4.29">raid to me feels a little bit like a</text>
  <text start="2381.35" dur="5.28">sessions figure where you may not know</text>
  <text start="2384.14" dur="4.11">or find out just exactly how much work</text>
  <text start="2386.63" dur="3">he&amp;#39;s done until he&amp;#39;s gone right I think</text>
  <text start="2388.25" dur="2.97">Jeff Sessions feels like that right now</text>
  <text start="2389.63" dur="3.63">when we see the investigations that are</text>
  <text start="2391.22" dur="4.86">coming out and you realize bars only</text>
  <text start="2393.26" dur="4.89">been in since February it goes back to</text>
  <text start="2396.08" dur="3.84">Jeff right when he first got to you know</text>
  <text start="2398.15" dur="2.58">into the administration and the work</text>
  <text start="2399.92" dur="3.09">that he was doing over at the Department</text>
  <text start="2400.73" dur="3.33">of Justice that nobody knew about but it</text>
  <text start="2403.01" dur="3.06">also could be that what you just said</text>
  <text start="2404.06" dur="2.64">which is is Christopher ray a sleeper</text>
  <text start="2406.07" dur="3.84">for the deeps</text>
  <text start="2406.7" dur="5.19">well here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s a thing the people</text>
  <text start="2409.91" dur="4.62">that have been fired from the FBI I have</text>
  <text start="2411.89" dur="4.89">been using as evidence that Chris ray is</text>
  <text start="2414.53" dur="3.66">is doing the thing the job that needs to</text>
  <text start="2416.78" dur="2.91">be done he&amp;#39;s getting rid of all this</text>
  <text start="2418.19" dur="5.79">corrupt people the problem with that</text>
  <text start="2419.69" dur="6.3">argument is that people in the</text>
  <text start="2423.98" dur="4.47">Department of Justice had already opened</text>
  <text start="2425.99" dur="6.81">these investigations into Lisa Paige</text>
  <text start="2428.45" dur="6.69">croc right rebecky into so the question</text>
  <text start="2432.8" dur="4.289">is firing them as a result of pressure</text>
  <text start="2435.14" dur="4.02">or because of heat he recognizes their</text>
  <text start="2437.089" dur="3.811">corruption right the if once you have an</text>
  <text start="2439.16" dur="4.11">investigation open into your own</text>
  <text start="2440.9" dur="4.26">employees in the FBI if they have been</text>
  <text start="2443.27" dur="3.48">found to be illegally leaking classified</text>
  <text start="2445.16" dur="4.59">information if they&amp;#39;ve been guilty of</text>
  <text start="2446.75" dur="4.859">corrupt acts as a FBI director you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2449.75" dur="4.23">have any choice right to get rid of them</text>
  <text start="2451.609" dur="4.351">Yeah right that&amp;#39;s the logical thing yeah</text>
  <text start="2453.98" dur="4.2">that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily prove that</text>
  <text start="2455.96" dur="5.639">Chris Rea is a white hat it&amp;#39;s true right</text>

  <text start="2732.44" dur="5.88">effect of it in all these election so I</text>
  <text start="2735.94" dur="4.69">lost I&amp;#39;m not convinced that Bennett is</text>

  <text start="2740.63" dur="3.84">well here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the real here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2742.25" dur="4.92">reality okay President Trump isn&amp;#39;t gonna</text>

  <text start="2747.17" dur="3.63">every problem with a hammer and just</text>
  <text start="2749.36" dur="2.88">started squashing it and those were they</text>
  <text start="2750.8" dur="3.81">in the form of either executive orders</text>

  <text start="2760.1" dur="6.15">in my opinion if you were gonna</text>
  <text start="2762.17" dur="5.85">influence foreign elections lawfully you</text>
  <text start="2766.25" dur="3.45">have to terminate and remove somebody</text>

  <text start="2864.92" dur="4.829">deep state from foreign nations has been</text>
  <text start="2867.38" dur="4.379">funding us and at some point I started</text>

  <text start="2946.769" dur="6.24">who actually need need the money if we</text>

  <text start="2999.839" dur="5.94">during the war like there wasn&amp;#39;t there</text>
  <text start="3002.509" dur="6.57">was a Newsweek article that said forty</text>

  <text start="3021.95" dur="4.319">of that war there is actually in that</text>
  <text start="3024.499" dur="3.481">this is a news I think it&amp;#39;s a Newsweek</text>
  <text start="3026.269" dur="4.98">article that interviewed one of the</text>
  <text start="3027.98" dur="4.799">people who was actually helping for the</text>
  <text start="3031.249" dur="3.54">Federal Reserve Bank in New York which</text>
  <text start="3032.779" dur="4.411">is where the cash from who said they</text>
  <text start="3034.789" dur="4.77">were ship loaded they were shipping four</text>
  <text start="3037.19" dur="4.02">to five billion dollars of shipment and</text>
  <text start="3039.559" dur="2.611">they couldn&amp;#39;t get it out fast enough</text>
  <text start="3041.21" dur="2.46">because they needed to get it all</text>
  <text start="3042.17" dur="3.359">delivered by the end of the war that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3043.67" dur="3.81">insane just flying it over their planes</text>
  <text start="3045.529" dur="3.75">and dropping it off and the money was</text>
  <text start="3047.48" dur="5.609">disappearing right right so the deep</text>
  <text start="3049.279" dur="5.431">state is literally high sting money said</text>
  <text start="3053.089" dur="3.27">the Federal Reserve taking it to Iraq</text>
  <text start="3054.71" dur="3.119">dropping it off in plane loads and then</text>
  <text start="3056.359" dur="3.9">they&amp;#39;re taking it all back into their</text>
  <text start="3057.829" dur="4.68">coffers so why does Dilli say these</text>
  <text start="3060.259" dur="3.931">can&amp;#39;t make America great again without</text>
  <text start="3062.509" dur="4.11">destroying the Federal Reserve this is</text>
  <text start="3064.19" dur="3.51">why because the Federal Reserve has the</text>
  <text start="3066.619" dur="4.051">green light to</text>
  <text start="3067.7" dur="6.45">as much funny money as humanly possible</text>
  <text start="3070.67" dur="5.49">and is necessary with zero oversight</text>
  <text start="3074.15" dur="4.62">okay and when you&amp;#39;ve got a currency that</text>
  <text start="3076.16" dur="5.04">is backed by actual tangible assets such</text>
  <text start="3078.77" dur="4.29">as gold you can&amp;#39;t pull this crap you can</text>
  <text start="3081.2" dur="4.02">only pull this when there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="3083.06" dur="3.72">backing your your money other than two</text>
  <text start="3085.22" dur="3.99">things there&amp;#39;s two things back in the US</text>
  <text start="3086.78" dur="4.65">currency right now confidence in the</text>
  <text start="3089.21" dur="3.659">military because that&amp;#39;s it as long as</text>
  <text start="3091.43" dur="2.909">the world believes our money is worth</text>
  <text start="3092.869" dur="2.791">something it&amp;#39;s worth something and as</text>
  <text start="3094.339" dur="3.691">long as we&amp;#39;ve got a military that can</text>
  <text start="3095.66" dur="4.74">stomp out everybody on planet Earth by</text>
  <text start="3098.03" dur="5.01">themselves you can&amp;#39;t do anything to</text>
  <text start="3100.4" dur="4.53">debase or hurt our currency so this is</text>
  <text start="3103.04" dur="4.95">this ties exactly into this it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="3104.93" dur="4.679">only failsafe against reckless printing</text>
  <text start="3107.99" dur="3.119">of money which as we all know the</text>
  <text start="3109.609" dur="3.571">reserve not in fact federal at all</text>
  <text start="3111.109" dur="4.26">private bank six different banks that</text>
  <text start="3113.18" dur="4.56">institutionally own it but they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="3115.369" dur="3.99">able to print with no regard for anybody</text>
  <text start="3117.74" dur="4.859">and what&amp;#39;s fascinating but what you just</text>
  <text start="3119.359" dur="5.401">said is I&amp;#39;ve always argued that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3122.599" dur="3.781">been using US taxpayer dollars to</text>
  <text start="3124.76" dur="4.68">subsidize the rest of the planet right</text>
  <text start="3126.38" dur="5.79">what I didn&amp;#39;t understand and until</text>
  <text start="3129.44" dur="4.649">recently is not only were we subsidizing</text>
  <text start="3132.17" dur="4.74">other people around the globe at an</text>
  <text start="3134.089" dur="5.341">insane rate they&amp;#39;re using those foreign</text>
  <text start="3136.91" dur="4.949">entities to funnel and launder the money</text>
  <text start="3139.43" dur="4.679">back into our politicians yep through</text>
  <text start="3141.859" dur="4.111">donations and political action committee</text>
  <text start="3144.109" dur="4.681">stuff and everything else right yeah so</text>
  <text start="3145.97" dur="4.2">one of the cue drops cue has has</text>
  <text start="3148.79" dur="5.13">actually brought this up several times</text>
  <text start="3150.17" dur="5.88">what slush fund did Jeff Sessions shut</text>
  <text start="3153.92" dur="4.649">down once he became Victoria knurl this</text>
  <text start="3156.05" dur="3.72">is a slush fund well it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3158.569" dur="3.901">settlement fund that the Department of</text>
  <text start="3159.77" dur="5.61">Justice has right so DOJ had set up</text>
  <text start="3162.47" dur="5.94">years ago a settlement fund where money</text>
  <text start="3165.38" dur="8.459">is taken out taxpayer money comes out of</text>
  <text start="3168.41" dur="7.169">this fund to settle lawsuits against the</text>
  <text start="3173.839" dur="7.01">government things that nature unright</text>
  <text start="3175.579" dur="7.53">pew has suggested that politicians and</text>
  <text start="3180.849" dur="3.911">people like George Soros they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3183.109" dur="3.99">actually taking money out of this</text>
  <text start="3184.76" dur="5.49">Justice Department settlement fund and</text>
  <text start="3187.099" dur="4.651">George Soros organizations share blue</text>
  <text start="3190.25" dur="3.119">right-wing watch</text>
  <text start="3191.75" dur="3.48">they&amp;#39;re taking that money their funding</text>
  <text start="3193.369" dur="3.691">and Tifa when cue said you don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="3195.23" dur="6.48">George Soros funds and chief</text>
  <text start="3197.06" dur="8.3">his own pocket do you know what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3201.71" dur="7.38">using our money prep on their issues</text>
  <text start="3205.36" dur="6.04">David Brock and all his Media Matters</text>
  <text start="3209.09" dur="4.2">yeah they were using taxpayer money</text>
  <text start="3211.4" dur="3.69">coming out of the Justice Department</text>
  <text start="3213.29" dur="4.14">settlement fund to fund all those</text>
  <text start="3215.09" dur="4.38">activities you and I are paying for it</text>

  <text start="3226.64" dur="2.13">money comes from where it goes who gets</text>
  <text start="3228.47" dur="2.34">it</text>
  <text start="3228.77" dur="4.23">no no accountability so it seems that</text>
  <text start="3230.81" dur="3.87">like the two deep state pockets that</text>
  <text start="3233" dur="4.41">tend to be the ones they like to use the</text>
  <text start="3234.68" dur="4.59">most are either the slush funds that are</text>
  <text start="3237.41" dur="3.39">the government stuff right or if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3239.27" dur="3.3">gonna be in the private sector it&amp;#39;s the</text>
