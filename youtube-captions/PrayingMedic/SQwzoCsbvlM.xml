  <text start="158.41" dur="3.99">but you&amp;#39;re not going to be doing graphic</text>
  <text start="159.88" dur="5.52">design for other people yeah I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="5.01">been a long and a lot of people are in</text>
  <text start="165.4" dur="5.4">the same boat that we are you know once</text>

  <text start="170.8" dur="4.92">even if you know like this is</text>
  <text start="172.06" dur="6.69">self-employment for me but it&amp;#39;s just not</text>

  <text start="178.75" dur="4.8">doing graphic design I I don&amp;#39;t feel like</text>
  <text start="181.6" dur="6.36">it&amp;#39;s what I want to do and it&amp;#39;s what God</text>
  <text start="183.55" dur="7.56">is calling me to do right now it was a</text>
  <text start="187.96" dur="5.46">way to make money that was pretty stable</text>
  <text start="191.11" dur="3.75">and that&amp;#39;s one of the things that a lot</text>
  <text start="193.42" dur="4.29">of us are wrestling with right now is</text>
  <text start="194.86" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;re in these jobs where we have the</text>
  <text start="197.71" dur="4.98">skill set we can do the work we&amp;#39;re good</text>
  <text start="200.65" dur="5.04">at it I&amp;#39;m a decent paramedic</text>
  <text start="202.69" dur="6.33">I don&amp;#39;t kill too many people but yet I</text>
  <text start="205.69" dur="5.27">feel like it&amp;#39;s holding me back that I</text>
  <text start="209.02" dur="5.43">can do some other things and more things</text>
  <text start="210.96" dur="4.42">but it&amp;#39;s gonna require me not working as</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="4.62">a paramedic anymore</text>
  <text start="215.38" dur="7.13">right there&amp;#39;s a time constraint now you</text>
  <text start="219.07" dur="5.69">spend a lot of your spare time</text>
  <text start="222.51" dur="5.1">connecting with people on Facebook</text>
  <text start="224.76" dur="5.8">writing your blog posts writing books</text>
  <text start="227.61" dur="5.62">writing writing writing and editing and</text>
  <text start="230.56" dur="6.06">doing podcasts now and that could be</text>
  <text start="233.23" dur="7.98">opened up so much more if you weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="7.35">working 48 plus hours as a medic and as</text>
  <text start="241.21" dur="5.09">much as you still you still like being a</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="6.3">medic it&amp;#39;s not like you hate it you</text>
  <text start="246.3" dur="5.32">still have some good experiences on the</text>
  <text start="250.27" dur="4.71">job and everything and you work with</text>
  <text start="251.62" dur="8.28">some good people yeah but it&amp;#39;s been 30</text>
  <text start="254.98" dur="7.74">years you know a long time yeah and I</text>
  <text start="259.9" dur="5.85">just feel like I guess I feel like</text>
  <text start="262.72" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s more things I can do that are</text>
  <text start="265.75" dur="5.85">more challenging that would give me the</text>
  <text start="268.03" dur="6.66">ability to reach more people and to</text>
  <text start="271.6" dur="6.72">impact a larger audience and to inspire</text>
  <text start="274.69" dur="6.9">people in some bigger ways if I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="278.32" dur="6.63">working as a paramedic the hours I put</text>
  <text start="281.59" dur="6.33">in on the job as a medic really restrict</text>
  <text start="284.95" dur="4.59">what I can do right now so for those of</text>
  <text start="287.92" dur="3.74">you who are a creative person and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="289.54" dur="5.4">whether you&amp;#39;re a writer a painter</text>
  <text start="291.66" dur="6.34">whether you draw charcoal or pencil</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="5.52">whether you&amp;#39;re a singer or dancer maybe</text>
  <text start="298" dur="4.11">you&amp;#39;re a drummer whatever it is that</text>
  <text start="300.46" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;re doing whatever it is that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="302.11" dur="5.84">gifted at whatever your expertise is if</text>
  <text start="305.08" dur="6.54">you&amp;#39;re a creative person this message is</text>
  <text start="307.95" dur="6.28">to encourage you to consider taking that</text>
  <text start="311.62" dur="5.94">creative ability and making it your</text>
  <text start="314.23" dur="7.65">full-time work your passion and your</text>
  <text start="317.56" dur="6.89">income mm-hmm and that&amp;#39;s where this gets</text>
  <text start="321.88" dur="6.78">a little tricky because people who are</text>
  <text start="324.45" dur="6.97">believers and who have ministry ideas</text>
  <text start="328.66" dur="4.8">with their creativity I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="331.42" dur="5.79">times they&amp;#39;re always afraid to earn</text>
  <text start="333.46" dur="6.84">money or to ask for money for what they</text>
  <text start="337.21" dur="5.34">do I was well you know how we still like</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="3.54">that book I was like that when you</text>
  <text start="342.55" dur="3.69">started talking to me about writing the</text>
  <text start="343.84" dur="4.82">book the first book I just couldn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="5.87">myself asking for money for the book</text>
  <text start="348.66" dur="7.75">right but the book was years of work</text>
  <text start="352.11" dur="7.84">years three years and then a whole lot</text>
  <text start="356.41" dur="5.1">of work to prepare it not just the</text>
  <text start="359.95" dur="4.32">writing and the revelation that you</text>
  <text start="361.51" dur="5.13">gained over three years and of healing</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="4.56">people and everything but then just us</text>
  <text start="366.64" dur="3.84">sitting down and saying okay how do we</text>
  <text start="368.83" dur="4.38">make this into a book and we had a lot</text>
  <text start="370.48" dur="4.44">of learning curve too even though you</text>
  <text start="373.21" dur="3.42">worked for a publisher there was still a</text>
  <text start="374.92" dur="4.53">huge learning curve for both of us to</text>
  <text start="376.63" dur="5.64">learn how to take the revelation put it</text>
  <text start="379.45" dur="5.13">into a book and then market it and get</text>
  <text start="382.27" dur="4.02">it into the hands of a lot of people so</text>
  <text start="384.58" dur="4.58">we&amp;#39;re gonna talk a little bit about that</text>
  <text start="386.29" dur="6.09">process and I&amp;#39;m gonna be quite honest</text>
  <text start="389.16" dur="6.7">myself like a lot of people who are</text>
  <text start="392.38" dur="6.41">believers we have a poverty mindset we</text>
  <text start="395.86" dur="5.97">had this mindset where we feel like</text>
  <text start="398.79" dur="6.49">we&amp;#39;re not entitled to live an abundant</text>
  <text start="401.83" dur="5.22">life we just feel like we need to get by</text>
  <text start="405.28" dur="4.11">and we&amp;#39;re just going to live paycheck to</text>
  <text start="407.05" dur="4.44">paycheck and God really isn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="409.39" dur="4.67">bless us financially you know because of</text>
  <text start="411.49" dur="5.34">the prosperity gospel quote/unquote</text>
  <text start="414.06" dur="4.42">that&amp;#39;s been out there for a few years a</text>
  <text start="416.83" dur="4.71">lot of people have had a negative</text>
  <text start="418.48" dur="5.73">reaction to that and it&amp;#39;s like you swing</text>
  <text start="421.54" dur="4.65">entirely the opposite direction and say</text>
  <text start="424.21" dur="4.77">well now I have to be poor you know</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="4.56">because I don&amp;#39;t like that hole yeah</text>
  <text start="428.98" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s like yeah it&amp;#39;s like either</text>
  <text start="430.75" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re out there to be driving a gold</text>
  <text start="433.48" dur="3.66">Mercedes Benz or you&amp;#39;re living</text>
  <text start="435.76" dur="3.09">paycheck-to-paycheck and there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="437.14" dur="3.6">in them driving a rusty car that breaks</text>
  <text start="438.85" dur="4.26">down all the time and you can&amp;#39;t get to</text>
  <text start="440.74" dur="4.56">your job or whatever I think there is</text>
  <text start="443.11" dur="6.09">some middle ground right I think there</text>
  <text start="445.3" dur="6.42">is - and my wife and I aren&amp;#39;t motivated</text>
  <text start="449.2" dur="5.28">to make a million dollars and live a</text>
  <text start="451.72" dur="3.96">lavish lifestyle we&amp;#39;re doing okay</text>
  <text start="454.48" dur="3.96">financially we&amp;#39;re doing pretty well</text>
  <text start="455.68" dur="4.98">especially in the last few months book</text>
  <text start="458.44" dur="5.4">sales have been doing really well and at</text>
  <text start="460.66" dur="6.6">this point I could probably quit my job</text>
  <text start="463.84" dur="6.27">as a paramedic if I wanted to we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="467.26" dur="4.5">making enough now off the books that I</text>
  <text start="470.11" dur="4.08">could quit my job</text>
  <text start="471.76" dur="5.7">but that might put us back into the</text>
  <text start="474.19" dur="5.19">struggling yeah so arena I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="477.46" dur="5.04">continue to work as a medic for a while</text>
  <text start="479.38" dur="5.07">and my sweetie here has made a deal with</text>
  <text start="482.5" dur="4.56">me that once we reach a plateau where</text>
  <text start="484.45" dur="4.89">our income is fairly consistently at a</text>
  <text start="487.06" dur="5.16">certain level and there&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="489.34" dur="6.93">danger of it dropping off dramatically</text>
  <text start="492.22" dur="6.78">then I will become a writer a full-time</text>
  <text start="496.27" dur="3.99">writer right I mean I&amp;#39;m looking forward</text>
  <text start="499" dur="4.65">to that because then we&amp;#39;ll be home</text>
  <text start="500.26" dur="5.55">together all day and we&amp;#39;ll be working in</text>
  <text start="503.65" dur="4.8">the home together and we enjoy being</text>
  <text start="505.81" dur="3.93">together so that&amp;#39;ll be pretty cool we do</text>
  <text start="508.45" dur="3.36">like being together I miss you like</text>
  <text start="509.74" dur="4.59">crazy when I&amp;#39;m at work yeah I miss you</text>
  <text start="511.81" dur="5.88">too I probably get more done when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="514.33" dur="6.87">not here - truth be told but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="5.37">know why that is because because I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.2" dur="4.5">have to be going in and checking on you</text>
  <text start="523.06" dur="4.23">and seeing how you&amp;#39;re doing but so it</text>
  <text start="525.7" dur="3.33">was about three years ago you and I</text>
  <text start="527.29" dur="4.53">started having our first conversations</text>
  <text start="529.03" dur="5.31">about me writing books and doing that</text>
  <text start="531.82" dur="4.56">full-time and I could not wrap my brain</text>
  <text start="534.34" dur="3.57">around it for the life of me I just</text>
  <text start="536.38" dur="4.38">thought no way I&amp;#39;m just gonna be a</text>
  <text start="537.91" dur="4.86">paramedic till I&amp;#39;m 65 collect my Social</text>
  <text start="540.76" dur="2.64">Security maybe I will vote out a pension</text>
  <text start="542.77" dur="3.06">maybe I will</text>
  <text start="543.4" dur="6.84">who knows and I had a poverty mindset</text>
  <text start="545.83" dur="5.73">and you spent a lot of time basically</text>
  <text start="550.24" dur="3.78">coaching me</text>
  <text start="551.56" dur="4.8">out of that poverty mindset into a</text>
  <text start="554.02" dur="5.97">mindset where I could see myself</text>
  <text start="556.36" dur="6.93">actually being successful as a writer</text>
  <text start="559.99" dur="4.85">and thank God you had a little bit of</text>
  <text start="563.29" dur="4.2">experience running your own business</text>
  <text start="564.84" dur="4.84">years ago I mean it wasn&amp;#39;t a huge</text>
  <text start="567.49" dur="2.82">business but you had already had your</text>
  <text start="569.68" dur="1.86">own business</text>
  <text start="570.31" dur="4.56">and you knew a little bit about what</text>
  <text start="571.54" dur="5.7">that was like right I have actually</text>
  <text start="574.87" dur="3.9">started several businesses and some of</text>
  <text start="577.24" dur="5.31">them just did terribly but that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="578.77" dur="5.64">usually successful people in in their</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="5.67">own business have failed a few times</text>
  <text start="584.41" dur="7.619">first actually James all teacher is a</text>
  <text start="588.22" dur="7.11">great role model we&amp;#39;ll put a link in the</text>
  <text start="592.029" dur="4.711">podcast notes to the current book by</text>
  <text start="595.33" dur="4.62">James that were reading which is called</text>
  <text start="596.74" dur="4.98">choose yourself choose yourself and to</text>
  <text start="599.95" dur="3.75">choose yourself guide to wealth there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="3.36">two books we&amp;#39;re reading the second one</text>
  <text start="603.7" dur="4.32">right now I probably should have read</text>
  <text start="605.08" dur="6.3">the first one first but you know choose</text>
  <text start="608.02" dur="6.33">yourself it&amp;#39;s about kind of like hiring</text>
  <text start="611.38" dur="8.43">yourself and trusting that you can do it</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="8.01">rather than relying on a company to hire</text>
  <text start="619.81" dur="4.08">you and and they could boot you out the</text>
  <text start="622.36" dur="3.36">door at any time or they could close</text>
  <text start="623.89" dur="5.25">they could be making bad decisions that</text>
  <text start="625.72" dur="5.91">affect your family whereas if you choose</text>
  <text start="629.14" dur="4.98">yourself and you are in business for</text>
  <text start="631.63" dur="5.01">yourself then you are at the helm and</text>
  <text start="634.12" dur="5.85">you get to make the decisions and they</text>
  <text start="636.64" dur="5.67">can be a little bit scary yeah but it is</text>
  <text start="639.97" dur="4.74">very very liberating once you wrap your</text>
  <text start="642.31" dur="5.12">brain around the idea that you can take</text>
  <text start="644.71" dur="5.46">your creative abilities and talents and</text>
  <text start="647.43" dur="5.47">build a network and make some</text>

  <text start="825.06" dur="5.46">says write it down he even uses what he</text>
  <text start="827.97" dur="4.44">uses is a little waitress pad you know</text>
  <text start="830.52" dur="4.23">like a little order pad from a</text>
  <text start="832.41" dur="4.95">restaurant he buys them by the hundreds</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="4.71">I think online and then he just writes</text>
  <text start="837.36" dur="4.59">his ten ideas on that and they can be</text>
  <text start="839.46" dur="3.81">crappy ideas to ya honey but you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="841.95" dur="3.84">eventually come up with some good ideas</text>
  <text start="843.27" dur="4.5">he said a lot of the ideas might not</text>
  <text start="845.79" dur="4.11">even be a product or something you can</text>
  <text start="847.77" dur="4.62">sell they&amp;#39;re just ideas you know of</text>
  <text start="849.9" dur="6.48">anything they could be stupid ideas for</text>

  <text start="856.38" dur="5.13">keep what he does is he keeps the good</text>
  <text start="858.63" dur="4.59">ones and then when he if something would</text>
  <text start="861.51" dur="4.89">fail in his business he would have this</text>
  <text start="863.22" dur="4.86">all these ideas saved up other ideas so</text>
  <text start="866.4" dur="3.54">you could switch gears and do something</text>

  <text start="869.94" dur="4.62">into the roadblock and they hit the wall</text>
  <text start="871.56" dur="4.98">because they run out of ideas something</text>

  <text start="890.7" dur="5.34">books one of the things that got me</text>
  <text start="894" dur="4.65">started or writing my first book on</text>
  <text start="896.04" dur="5.01">divine healing was I had people coming</text>
  <text start="898.65" dur="4.32">to me asking me questions mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="901.05" dur="4.77">because I had developed a little bit of</text>
  <text start="902.97" dur="5.16">expertise in healing and I had seen some</text>
  <text start="905.82" dur="4.23">people not healed and I saw some people</text>
  <text start="908.13" dur="4.02">who were healed and they lost their</text>
  <text start="910.05" dur="4.32">healing and I had a lot of discussions</text>
  <text start="912.15" dur="4.95">with people who had success in healing</text>
  <text start="914.37" dur="4.53">on Facebook I was having all these</text>
  <text start="917.1" dur="3.99">discussions with people from around the</text>
  <text start="918.9" dur="4.08">world who had a fair amount of success</text>
  <text start="921.09" dur="4.29">in healing we had a lot of question and</text>
  <text start="922.98" dur="5.4">answer sessions and I kind of gleaned a</text>
  <text start="925.38" dur="6.42">lot of the answers and wrote all that</text>
  <text start="928.38" dur="5.07">stuff down and people were always asking</text>
  <text start="931.8" dur="4.79">me these questions and I would send them</text>
  <text start="933.45" dur="5.4">you know a message on Facebook and</text>
  <text start="936.59" dur="3.67">inevitably somebody a week later would</text>
  <text start="938.85" dur="3.09">ask the same question and I&amp;#39;d have to</text>
  <text start="940.26" dur="4.17">write out the same answer again and send</text>
  <text start="941.94" dur="4.26">it to them so finally I realized man</text>
  <text start="944.43" dur="3.66">Peola same people all these people are</text>
  <text start="946.2" dur="4.02">asking the same questions maybe I need</text>
  <text start="948.09" dur="4.32">to just write it all out</text>
  <text start="950.22" dur="3.27">in a little document that I can copy and</text>
  <text start="952.41" dur="4.29">paste for all these people that are</text>
  <text start="953.49" dur="5.46">asking questions so I started doing that</text>
  <text start="956.7" dur="5.19">and I wrote out these little documents</text>
  <text start="958.95" dur="4.8">and saved him and after I had about</text>
  <text start="961.89" dur="3.57">twenty of these documents written that</text>
  <text start="963.75" dur="3.57">answered all these questions people</text>

  <text start="967.32" dur="5.73">that stuff and put it in a book and I</text>
  <text start="971.22" dur="6.27">thought no way I don&amp;#39;t want to do that</text>
  <text start="973.05" dur="7.53">but the reality of it is one of the key</text>
  <text start="977.49" dur="4.98">things about writing a book is being</text>
  <text start="980.58" dur="4.26">able to answer people&amp;#39;s questions or</text>

  <text start="1952.76" dur="4.54">painter I&amp;#39;ve been away from it for years</text>
  <text start="1955.68" dur="4.86">because I was doing graphic design so</text>

  <text start="1960.54" dur="5.94">abstract art which is a learning curve</text>

  <text start="1966.48" dur="5.22">right now with my art is actually paint</text>
  <text start="1968.52" dur="5.25">and learn and grow as an artist but she</text>

  <text start="1999.59" dur="7.17">hire people to work for me and manage</text>

  <text start="2080.839" dur="5.01">thing I want to see what I can do as a</text>
  <text start="2082.97" dur="5.369">painter so I eventually because they</text>
  <text start="2085.849" dur="4.26">they weren&amp;#39;t finding anyone to replace</text>
  <text start="2088.339" dur="4.861">me even though I was saying I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="2090.109" dur="5.97">looking I have I don&amp;#39;t think they were</text>
  <text start="2093.2" dur="5.19">looking so then they come to me and</text>
  <text start="2096.079" dur="3.841">they&amp;#39;re all in a panic saying we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2098.39" dur="4.8">know what to do because you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2099.92" dur="5.55">to do this anymore and what can we do to</text>
  <text start="2103.19" dur="4.649">keep you and I&amp;#39;m thinking oh I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2105.47" dur="6.03">want you to keep me I want to leave I</text>
  <text start="2107.839" dur="5.791">don&amp;#39;t want to do this anymore and so I</text>
  <text start="2111.5" dur="4.38">thought about it and I got back to them</text>
  <text start="2113.63" dur="3.959">and I said well if I&amp;#39;m gonna do any more</text>
  <text start="2115.88" dur="3.479">work for you from this point on I need</text>
  <text start="2117.589" dur="6.361">to double my rate because it makes more</text>
  <text start="2119.359" dur="8.43">sense for me to to do what I love to do</text>
  <text start="2123.95" dur="6.089">then for me to continue doing this you</text>
  <text start="2127.789" dur="4.83">know I sit at the computer too long I</text>
  <text start="2130.039" dur="4.111">get neck pain I don&amp;#39;t want to put that</text>
  <text start="2132.619" dur="4.71">strain on my body I want to get up and</text>
  <text start="2134.15" dur="5.34">move around and paint and so you doubled</text>
  <text start="2137.329" dur="4.751">your race so I doubled my rate and what</text>
  <text start="2139.49" dur="5.2">did they say and then they said oh okay</text>
  <text start="2142.08" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ll pay that that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="2144.69" dur="4.41">every else is charging anyways I should</text>
  <text start="2147.63" dur="3.15">have tripled my rate</text>
  <text start="2149.1" dur="3">you should have doubled your rate two</text>
  <text start="2150.78" dur="4.47">years ago and then he should have</text>
  <text start="2152.1" dur="5.94">tripled your rate exactly so charging</text>
  <text start="2155.25" dur="4.38">too little you were charging too little</text>
  <text start="2158.04" dur="4.14">like he was creative people they were</text>
  <text start="2159.63" dur="6.51">willing to pay twice and I&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="2162.18" dur="5.88">worked for some ministries where I sent</text>
  <text start="2166.14" dur="3.48">them a bill and I usually cut them a</text>
  <text start="2168.06" dur="3.93">break because I know it&amp;#39;s hard in</text>
  <text start="2169.62" dur="4.08">ministry but I would send them a bill</text>
  <text start="2171.99" dur="3.92">for my work and they would end up</text>
  <text start="2173.7" dur="4.65">sending me more money than I asked for</text>
  <text start="2175.91" dur="6.88">because they just felt there was value</text>
  <text start="2178.35" dur="9.9">there so I think a lot of us do not</text>
  <text start="2182.79" dur="7.32">value when your value our work yeah we</text>
  <text start="2188.25" dur="5.16">think that we won&amp;#39;t have any business if</text>
  <text start="2190.11" dur="5.34">we charge more right but the reality is</text>
  <text start="2193.41" dur="4.65">you will find the people who are willing</text>
  <text start="2195.45" dur="5.76">to pay more you know that&amp;#39;s the shocker</text>
  <text start="2198.06" dur="5.25">for me when I started publishing books I</text>
  <text start="2201.21" dur="3.84">found all these people who are like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2203.31" dur="4.23">happy to pay 10 bucks for your Kindle</text>
  <text start="2205.05" dur="4.41">book that&amp;#39;s an awesome book I learned so</text>
  <text start="2207.54" dur="3.81">much I&amp;#39;ve actually seen people healed</text>
  <text start="2209.46" dur="4.86">I&amp;#39;ve seen family members healed this is</text>
  <text start="2211.35" dur="4.89">a great value for me 10 bucks to get a</text>
  <text start="2214.32" dur="4.74">class on healing they thought it was a</text>
  <text start="2216.24" dur="4.8">great deal and I&amp;#39;m thinking sometimes</text>
  <text start="2219.06" dur="3.27">maybe I should just like make it $0.99</text>
  <text start="2221.04" dur="3.54">permanently because it&amp;#39;s not worth that</text>
  <text start="2222.33" dur="4.83">much and that&amp;#39;s how we creative people</text>
  <text start="2224.58" dur="4.02">are we always undervalue what it is that</text>
  <text start="2227.16" dur="4.92">we&amp;#39;re doing we never think it&amp;#39;s worth it</text>
  <text start="2228.6" dur="5.16">what we&amp;#39;re asking for it so going back</text>
  <text start="2232.08" dur="3.63">to the formula I had for writing a</text>
  <text start="2233.76" dur="5.43">best-selling book so number one is</text>
  <text start="2235.71" dur="7.97">become part of or start up a community</text>

  <text start="2328.68" dur="4.98">my coach Sam Bennett says marketing is</text>
  <text start="2331.83" dur="4.02">getting people to know you</text>

  <text start="2340.23" dur="3.18">to be in community with people for that</text>
  <text start="2341.82" dur="3.09">time and that&amp;#39;s the thing because if</text>

  <text start="2344.91" dur="4.98">know like and trust you then you&amp;#39;re on</text>
