  <text start="132.31" dur="8.34">so starting out tonight is the shooting</text>
  <text start="136.6" dur="6.9">in parkland Florida I just checked in</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="3.39">with the Broward County Sheriff&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.5" dur="5.37">Department</text>
  <text start="144.04" dur="7.44">and their update 17 dead so far from the</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="5.4">shooting at the high school Marjory</text>
  <text start="151.48" dur="5.58">Stoneman Douglas high school so</text>
  <text start="154.27" dur="8.4">obviously those people the the friends</text>
  <text start="157.06" dur="9.63">and family need our prayers if you are</text>
  <text start="162.67" dur="5.84">wondering if this was a false flag this</text>
  <text start="166.69" dur="4.04">is not the periscope you&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="168.51" dur="5.86">somebody else will periscope about that</text>
  <text start="170.73" dur="6.87">I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s worth our time</text>
  <text start="174.37" dur="8.04">my time to go down that road right now I</text>
  <text start="177.6" dur="8.59">tell you this this afternoon I took a</text>
  <text start="182.41" dur="5.94">nap and I had a very vivid dream and it</text>
  <text start="186.19" dur="6.03">had to do with putting events on a</text>
  <text start="188.35" dur="6.6">timeline and it was strange because when</text>
  <text start="192.22" dur="4.5">I woke up from the nap Traci beans was</text>
  <text start="194.95" dur="4.43">starting a live YouTube broadcast and</text>
  <text start="196.72" dur="5.43">she was starting a timeline of events</text>
  <text start="199.38" dur="5.919">regarding I think some kind of collusion</text>
  <text start="202.15" dur="5.49">with FBI and DOJ timelines are</text>
  <text start="205.299" dur="4.561">incredibly important and in the dream</text>
  <text start="207.64" dur="4.05">that I had this afternoon someone was</text>
  <text start="209.86" dur="6.87">putting events on a timeline so they</text>
  <text start="211.69" dur="8.579">could see the relationship of events</text>
  <text start="216.73" dur="5.4">that seem to be unrelated all right so</text>
  <text start="220.269" dur="4.231">what I will say about that is this I</text>
  <text start="222.13" dur="4.26">think if people are willing to sit down</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="3.9">and take events and put them on a</text>
  <text start="226.39" dur="3.27">timeline they may see connections you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="228.4" dur="5.79">not going to see the connections if you</text>
  <text start="229.66" dur="6.51">don&amp;#39;t do that do it that way so I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="234.19" dur="3.63">going to have a lot of commentary on the</text>
  <text start="236.17" dur="3.659">shooting at the high school this</text>
  <text start="237.82" dur="5.97">afternoon other than to say please pray</text>
  <text start="239.829" dur="8.91">for the friends and the family keep them</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="9.6">in your prayers on a related note this</text>
  <text start="248.739" dur="7.231">morning there was some gunfire and an</text>
  <text start="253.39" dur="5.58">incident at the NSA&amp;#39;s headquarters in</text>
  <text start="255.97" dur="4.98">Fort Meade Maryland this morning car</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="3.33">tried to crash through a gate it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="260.95" dur="3.04">clear if it was trying to get in or get</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="4.06">out of the NSA</text>
  <text start="263.99" dur="4.109">there was some gunfire exchange there</text>
  <text start="266.36" dur="2.309">are three people arrested no one was</text>
  <text start="268.099" dur="2.94">killed</text>
  <text start="268.669" dur="4.891">highly suspicious we don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.039" dur="6.69">going on there hey from New Jersey</text>
  <text start="273.56" dur="5.729">what&amp;#39;s going on I don&amp;#39;t know if that is</text>
  <text start="277.729" dur="4.431">related to the shooting in Florida I</text>
  <text start="279.289" dur="5.791">don&amp;#39;t necessarily see a connection but</text>
  <text start="282.16" dur="4.3">like I said sometimes things are</text>
  <text start="285.08" dur="8.73">connected and you don&amp;#39;t always see it</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="8.7">and so that is some more news I thought</text>
  <text start="293.81" dur="2.759">that would be the big news of the day</text>
  <text start="295.16" dur="8.689">and then the shooting in Florida</text>
  <text start="296.569" dur="12.6">happened there is some good news</text>
  <text start="303.849" dur="8.651">president Trump&amp;#39;s tax plan has already</text>
  <text start="309.169" dur="5.911">created some good news</text>
  <text start="312.5" dur="7.11">the Treasury Department put out a report</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="7.019">today and this is about tax revenue and</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="6.45">spending for the month of January of</text>
  <text start="322.099" dur="6.151">this year the Treasury brought in 361</text>
  <text start="326.06" dur="6.859">billion dollars in total tax revenue for</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="7.56">January and they only spent 311 billion</text>
  <text start="332.919" dur="4.691">which means the Treasury had a forty</text>
  <text start="335.81" dur="4.77">nine billion dollar surplus for the</text>
  <text start="337.61" dur="6.27">month of January after lowering the</text>
  <text start="340.58" dur="6.53">federal tax rate they&amp;#39;re taking in more</text>
  <text start="343.88" dur="7.56">taxes and spending less money all right</text>
  <text start="347.11" dur="7.6">Trump his tax plan is is working the</text>
  <text start="351.44" dur="6.21">plan was lower tax rates generate more</text>
  <text start="354.71" dur="4.679">business more revenue comes in more</text>
  <text start="357.65" dur="4.98">taxes even at the lower tax rate</text>
  <text start="359.389" dur="6">they&amp;#39;re bringing in fact the 361 billion</text>
  <text start="362.63" dur="5.4">that was brought in in taxes for January</text>
  <text start="365.389" dur="4.83">is the record that the Treasury has</text>
  <text start="368.03" dur="5.52">never brought in that much money in in</text>
  <text start="370.219" dur="7.111">the history in history in January as the</text>
  <text start="373.55" dur="6.179">record-setting month so it looks like</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="3.69">Trump&amp;#39;s tax plan which some of the</text>
  <text start="379.729" dur="5.421">Democrats that was gonna be Armageddon</text>
  <text start="381.02" dur="9.06">is turning out to be a pretty good deal</text>
  <text start="385.15" dur="7.18">I wanted to comment real quickly on the</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="4.05">Susan Rice email that she sent to</text>
  <text start="392.33" dur="3.389">herself which has been out there</text>
  <text start="394.13" dur="4.05">floating around they found out that</text>
  <text start="395.719" dur="4.351">Susan Rice sent an email to herself</text>
  <text start="398.18" dur="4.23">her last day in the White House on</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="4.95">January 20th before they turned over the</text>
  <text start="402.41" dur="4.59">keys to the Trump administration Susan</text>
  <text start="405.02" dur="4.17">Rice emailed herself this little email</text>
  <text start="407" dur="3.889">and a lot of people have been wondering</text>
  <text start="409.19" dur="3.78">what that was all about</text>
  <text start="410.889" dur="4.87">some people have suspect that she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="412.97" dur="5.22">trying to cover for some transgressions</text>
  <text start="415.759" dur="4.621">by the Obama administration</text>
  <text start="418.19" dur="4.41">Nick short actually wrote a very good</text>
  <text start="420.38" dur="6">article on it and he believes Susan Rice</text>
  <text start="422.6" dur="7.379">is trying to cover herself there is a</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="7.95">very awkward exchange when Susan Rice</text>
  <text start="429.979" dur="5.821">and and had to hand over information to</text>
  <text start="434.33" dur="4.67">her counterpart in the Trump</text>
  <text start="435.8" dur="7.2">administration which was general flynn</text>
  <text start="439" dur="7.63">and one paragraph from that letter from</text>
  <text start="443" dur="7.37">Susan Rice is very telling it says from</text>
  <text start="446.63" dur="7.17">a national security perspective however</text>
  <text start="450.37" dur="5.47">President Obama said he wants to be sure</text>
  <text start="453.8" dur="4.56">that as we engage with the incoming</text>
  <text start="455.84" dur="4.71">transition team were mindful to</text>
  <text start="458.36" dur="5.4">ascertain and if there&amp;#39;s any reason that</text>
  <text start="460.55" dur="5.28">we cannot share information fully as it</text>
  <text start="463.76" dur="3.68">relates to Russia so there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="465.83" dur="4.26">question in this paragraph</text>
  <text start="467.44" dur="5.17">President Obama said he wanted to be</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="4.74">sure that if we share information with</text>
  <text start="472.61" dur="5.13">the Trump administration if we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="4.89">fully transparent about Russia that</text>
  <text start="477.74" dur="4.08">there&amp;#39;s a legitimate reason for it so</text>
  <text start="479.72" dur="4.56">what what that is basically saying is if</text>
  <text start="481.82" dur="5.219">there&amp;#39;s anything that Susan Rice hid</text>
  <text start="484.28" dur="5.19">from general Flynn concerning Russia it</text>
  <text start="487.039" dur="6.151">was at the direction of President Obama</text>
  <text start="489.47" dur="5.46">it wasn&amp;#39;t Susan Rice&amp;#39;s decision so this</text>
  <text start="493.19" dur="3.81">letter may be throwing Obama under the</text>
  <text start="494.93" dur="3.93">bus and saving Susan Rice that&amp;#39;s why she</text>
  <text start="497" dur="3.539">wrote that letter and in the event that</text>
  <text start="498.86" dur="6.239">she needed it that&amp;#39;s what NIC short says</text>
  <text start="500.539" dur="7.47">and Nick is a good commentator so on a</text>
  <text start="505.099" dur="6.181">related note general Flynn general</text>
  <text start="508.009" dur="8.431">Flynn&amp;#39;s legal counsel today filed a</text>
  <text start="511.28" dur="7.11">motion for discovery and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="516.44" dur="4.639">fairly involved I will just break it</text>
  <text start="518.39" dur="6.24">down for a real simple this motion</text>
  <text start="521.079" dur="6.641">requests all documents all evidence all</text>
  <text start="524.63" dur="5.699">testimony that Robert Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="527.72" dur="3.47">investigative team has found in his case</text>
  <text start="530.329" dur="2.271">where the</text>
  <text start="531.19" dur="4.889">they&amp;#39;re charging him with lying with the</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="5.34">FBI when you file for discovery you want</text>
  <text start="536.079" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re asking for all the documents to</text>
  <text start="537.94" dur="3.87">be made for prosecution to be made</text>
  <text start="539.649" dur="4.5">available so that opposing counsel can</text>
  <text start="541.81" dur="3.42">look at those documents and see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="544.149" dur="4.141">being used as evidence</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="4.14">now Flynn has already pled guilty to</text>
  <text start="548.29" dur="3.18">lying to the FBI</text>
  <text start="549.37" dur="4.699">now his legal team is filing for</text>
  <text start="551.47" dur="4.95">discovery what that means to me is</text>
  <text start="554.069" dur="4.721">they&amp;#39;re going to challenge this and</text>
  <text start="556.42" dur="4.709">they&amp;#39;re going to look at the evidence</text>
  <text start="558.79" dur="4.919">and the testimony because I think they</text>
  <text start="561.129" dur="4.801">suspect that the agents who interviewed</text>
  <text start="563.709" dur="3.451">him may have lied and here&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="565.93" dur="1.8">that&amp;#39;s really interesting about this</text>
  <text start="567.16" dur="6.39">whole thing</text>
  <text start="567.73" dur="9.029">a couple of months after general Flynn</text>
  <text start="573.55" dur="5.7">was interviewed by the FBI Comey told</text>
  <text start="576.759" dur="5.161">Congress he did not believe that Flynn</text>
  <text start="579.25" dur="5.73">lied or said anything that was untrue to</text>
  <text start="581.92" dur="4.68">the to his agents and and then months</text>
  <text start="584.98" dur="3.419">later he&amp;#39;s charged with lying to the FBI</text>
  <text start="586.6" dur="4.56">when Comey had already said he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="588.399" dur="5.49">think that Flynn lied so there&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="591.16" dur="4.5">question about why did Comey tell</text>
  <text start="593.889" dur="4.171">Congress he didn&amp;#39;t think Flynn lied and</text>
  <text start="595.66" dur="6.27">then his agents Muller ends up charging</text>
  <text start="598.06" dur="8.1">Flynn was lying that my suspicion is</text>
  <text start="601.93" dur="6.779">that is that struck Peter straw</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="5.279">interviewed Flynn may have fudged his</text>
  <text start="608.709" dur="5.671">3:02 may have lied on his report which</text>
  <text start="611.439" dur="3.27">allowed Muller to charge Flynn with</text>
  <text start="614.38" dur="2.519">lying</text>
  <text start="614.709" dur="6.87">I suspect Lin is gonna walk on all this</text>
  <text start="616.899" dur="6.06">stuff probably but it&amp;#39;s interesting to</text>
  <text start="621.579" dur="3.331">note that Flynn&amp;#39;s attorneys are now</text>
  <text start="622.959" dur="7.61">filing for a motion for discovery so</text>
  <text start="624.91" dur="5.659">that is really interesting to me anyway</text>
  <text start="630.899" dur="3.821">I&amp;#39;m gonna scroll my Twitter timeline</text>
  <text start="633.04" dur="4.799">here real quick and see if there&amp;#39;s any</text>
  <text start="634.72" dur="6.419">other news before I jump into the main</text>
  <text start="637.839" dur="6.511">event oh you know what I had a dream I</text>
  <text start="641.139" dur="5.25">should tell you about some of you saw</text>
  <text start="644.35" dur="3.57">this on my Twitter timeline I woke up</text>
  <text start="646.389" dur="7.291">this morning about five o&amp;#39;clock from a</text>
  <text start="647.92" dur="8.399">dream about Q Q in the dream Q was</text>
  <text start="653.68" dur="7.259">posting information and I was watching</text>
  <text start="656.319" dur="6.45">all the things that Q was posting and it</text>
  <text start="660.939" dur="3.161">all had to do with Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="662.769" dur="3.49">justices</text>
  <text start="664.1" dur="5.909">and specific cases that they were</text>
  <text start="666.259" dur="7.02">involved in and the information queue</text>
  <text start="670.009" dur="6.841">posted was not good not good for the</text>
  <text start="673.279" dur="8.271">judges it looked like the judges were</text>
  <text start="676.85" dur="7.469">being kind of outed for some at minimum</text>
  <text start="681.55" dur="6.279">conflict of interest at possibly worst</text>
  <text start="684.319" dur="5.7">corruption and blackmail or whatever so</text>
  <text start="687.829" dur="3.87">that&amp;#39;s what I saw in the dream queue was</text>
  <text start="690.019" dur="3.63">posting information about Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="691.699" dur="6.87">justices and cases they were involved</text>
  <text start="693.649" dur="7.291">with at the end of the dream the text</text>
  <text start="698.569" dur="5.01">turned all I can say is it was like it</text>
  <text start="700.94" dur="5.73">was highlighted in yellow like like a</text>
  <text start="703.579" dur="5.49">yellow bright highlighter some of the</text>
  <text start="706.67" dur="4.919">text that I was watching Q post just was</text>
  <text start="709.069" dur="4.08">highlighted in yellow and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
