  <text start="132.86" dur="6.42">they have been the mainstream media has</text>
  <text start="135.95" dur="6.9">been trying to convince people that Q</text>

  <text start="157.48" dur="5.62">they have been trying to connect Q and</text>

  <text start="166.22" dur="4.5">from their platforms and if they can</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="4.68">connect Q and keep the Q movement to</text>
  <text start="170.72" dur="4.29">those people then they feel they have a</text>
  <text start="172.88" dur="5.01">legitimate reason to ban us from the</text>
  <text start="175.01" dur="6.33">platforms so Q has warned us that</text>
  <text start="177.89" dur="7.26">attacks are going to increase and Q has</text>
  <text start="181.34" dur="6.119">actually suggested that discussions of Q</text>
  <text start="185.15" dur="3.75">at some point in the future are going to</text>
  <text start="187.459" dur="3.601">be completely removed from all platforms</text>
  <text start="188.9" dur="7.649">all social media Facebook Twitter</text>
  <text start="191.06" dur="7.8">YouTube Q has suggested that all</text>
  <text start="196.549" dur="6.121">discussions of Q are going to be banned</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="7.92">from all social media platforms one Ian</text>
  <text start="202.67" dur="7.08">ons asked you why he had removed posts</text>
  <text start="206.78" dur="4.56">from the Patriots fight board and Q</text>
  <text start="209.75" dur="5.94">responded that Patriots fight was</text>
  <text start="211.34" dur="6.119">primarily for topics of general interest</text>
  <text start="215.69" dur="3.75">but that in the future</text>
  <text start="217.459" dur="4.861">Patriots fight would be used for</text>
  <text start="219.44" dur="5.04">discussions related to Q when those</text>
  <text start="222.32" dur="6.63">discussions had been removed from all</text>
  <text start="224.48" dur="7.05">social media platforms and I have been</text>
  <text start="228.95" dur="4.23">thinking about that post ever since that</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="5.28">came out and it&amp;#39;s been seven or eight</text>
  <text start="233.18" dur="5.85">months since Q posted that I&amp;#39;ve been you</text>
  <text start="236.81" dur="5.52">know kind of contemplating okay what do</text>
  <text start="239.03" dur="6.48">I do if YouTube shuts down my platform</text>
  <text start="242.33" dur="7.08">if they ban my channel if Vimeo bans my</text>
  <text start="245.51" dur="6.449">channel if Twitter kicks me off and if I</text>
  <text start="249.41" dur="4.32">lose my periscope account right what do</text>
  <text start="251.959" dur="3.75">i do then what&amp;#39;s my next move</text>
  <text start="253.73" dur="5.28">so I&amp;#39;ve been I&amp;#39;ve been planning for this</text>
  <text start="255.709" dur="7.921">and I&amp;#39;ve been uploading all of my videos</text>
  <text start="259.01" dur="6.839">to my Vimeo channel so right now I have</text>
  <text start="263.63" dur="6.24">about two months worth of videos I need</text>
  <text start="265.849" dur="6.241">to get caught up on I I will work this</text>
  <text start="269.87" dur="6.359">week to make sure all of my videos that</text>
  <text start="272.09" dur="8.07">are on YouTube are also on Vimeo so that</text>
  <text start="276.229" dur="5.821">if my youtube channel disappears you can</text>
  <text start="280.16" dur="5.52">at least go to Vimeo and find the videos</text>
  <text start="282.05" dur="5.73">there now when Alex Jones was D</text>
  <text start="285.68" dur="5.549">platformed they removed him from</text>
  <text start="287.78" dur="5.43">Facebook Twitter YouTube and Vimeo</text>
  <text start="291.229" dur="5.19">they took off without his Vimeo channel</text>
  <text start="293.21" dur="6.23">to I don&amp;#39;t know if Vimeo is going to</text>
  <text start="296.419" dur="6.691">allow me to stay around I hope they do</text>
  <text start="299.44" dur="6.01">but right now I have all of my videos</text>
  <text start="303.11" dur="4.29">that are here on YouTube they&amp;#39;re there</text>
  <text start="305.45" dur="3.57">over on Vimeo with exception of a few</text>
  <text start="307.4" dur="5.37">which I&amp;#39;ll upload the rest of them this</text>
  <text start="309.02" dur="5.399">week so Vimeo is a backup source of my</text>
  <text start="312.77" dur="5.91">videos in the event that my YouTube</text>
  <text start="314.419" dur="6.391">channel gets taken down my videos all of</text>
  <text start="318.68" dur="4.65">them are also available on my podcast</text>
  <text start="320.81" dur="6.359">channel so I have a podcast channel on</text>
  <text start="323.33" dur="7.29">pod bean and I&amp;#39;m do both audio and video</text>
  <text start="327.169" dur="5.541">versions of my Q decodes you can find</text>
  <text start="330.62" dur="6.51">them there they&amp;#39;re available on iTunes</text>
  <text start="332.71" dur="6.959">but at some point in the future my</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="5.34">channel may get yanked from iTunes I</text>
  <text start="339.669" dur="4.301">don&amp;#39;t know if pod bean is planning on</text>
  <text start="342.47" dur="3.41">taking any action against me I think</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="4.56">they probably won&amp;#39;t but who knows I</text>
  <text start="345.88" dur="4.33">could lose my pod bean account</text>
  <text start="348.53" dur="3.74">I could lose my iTunes account and they</text>
  <text start="350.21" dur="7.829">could shut me down on Vimeo so what then</text>
  <text start="352.27" dur="9.04">well I have a back-up plan I have a</text>
  <text start="358.039" dur="6.541">hosting service that I&amp;#39;m using to self</text>
  <text start="361.31" dur="6.78">host my website I also have a hosting</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="7.05">service that would allow me to host all</text>
  <text start="368.09" dur="8.97">of my videos on my own hosting service</text>
  <text start="371.63" dur="7.23">and I could do not only upload videos to</text>
  <text start="377.06" dur="5.609">my website but I could do live streaming</text>
  <text start="378.86" dur="5.97">to my website I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about</text>
