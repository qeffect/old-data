  <text start="120.28" dur="9.33">prayer session with a mother yeah woman</text>
  <text start="125.709" dur="6.451">who&amp;#39;s a mother of a friend who has some</text>
  <text start="129.61" dur="5.94">kind of neurological degenerative</text>
  <text start="132.16" dur="4.83">disease that is some kind of palsy of</text>
  <text start="135.55" dur="4.89">paralyzed muscles in her throat she</text>
  <text start="136.99" dur="6.81">can&amp;#39;t swallow so she has a feeding tube</text>
  <text start="140.44" dur="4.889">and she can&amp;#39;t speak so this friend</text>
  <text start="143.8" dur="3.54">contacted me asked me to come down to</text>
  <text start="145.329" dur="3.69">her house and pray with her mother and I</text>
  <text start="147.34" dur="2.7">spent a couple hours done that yesterday</text>
  <text start="149.019" dur="3.931">Francoeur</text>
  <text start="150.04" dur="5.69">it was very interesting because I felt</text>
  <text start="152.95" dur="6.869">like she needed some emotional healing</text>
  <text start="155.73" dur="6.13">in order to affect the physical healing</text>
  <text start="159.819" dur="4.081">good I prayed over her for physical</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="4.049">healing before about I don&amp;#39;t know ten</text>
  <text start="163.9" dur="4.22">minutes but there was no changes and</text>
  <text start="165.909" dur="4.47">after I prayed for her physical healing</text>
  <text start="168.12" dur="5.14">we got to talk for quite a while about</text>
  <text start="170.379" dur="5.61">emotional healing which was really good</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="4.77">I got to basically teach them a lot but</text>
  <text start="175.989" dur="4.681">when it came down to praying with her</text>
  <text start="178.03" dur="4.41">mother for the emotional healing it was</text>
  <text start="180.67" dur="4.89">really difficult to do because she</text>
  <text start="182.44" dur="5.73">couldn&amp;#39;t speak she was able to write so</text>
  <text start="185.56" dur="3.81">she was writing on a tablet and I would</text>
  <text start="188.17" dur="3.659">ask her questions and she would write</text>
  <text start="189.37" dur="5.07">the answers and I walked her through the</text>
  <text start="191.829" dur="5.671">usual protocol that I use for emotional</text>
  <text start="194.44" dur="5.639">healing the family was aware that she</text>
  <text start="197.5" dur="4.709">had been holding a lot of anger and</text>
  <text start="200.079" dur="4.77">unforgiveness towards one of the family</text>
  <text start="202.209" dur="6.991">members for something that had happened</text>
  <text start="204.849" dur="5.73">as a recurring incident so the best I</text>
  <text start="209.2" dur="4.409">could I explained to her what I needed</text>
  <text start="210.579" dur="6.421">to do basically let her have her let go</text>
  <text start="213.609" dur="4.651">of the anger and forgive this person and</text>
  <text start="217" dur="3.569">she had really it seemed like she was</text>
  <text start="218.26" dur="4.379">having a hard time doing it because when</text>
  <text start="220.569" dur="5.881">we would take her through the incident</text>
  <text start="222.639" dur="5.731">and never recall an event that caused</text>
  <text start="226.45" dur="4.159">the anger feelings of here to come up I</text>
  <text start="228.37" dur="4.83">would ask her to give it to Jesus</text>
  <text start="230.609" dur="4.75">receive his healing and then we&amp;#39;d go</text>
  <text start="233.2" dur="4.469">through the event again then she kept</text>
  <text start="235.359" dur="4.38">like coming up with anger which is</text>
  <text start="237.669" dur="4.47">really unusual I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever</text>
  <text start="239.739" dur="3.601">had that happened before usually the</text>
  <text start="242.139" dur="5.091">anger is gone but there&amp;#39;s some other</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="3.89">emotion that comes up that you can heal</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="5.98">right and eventually get the person free</text>
  <text start="250.63" dur="7.079">of all those negative emotions from that</text>
  <text start="253.48" dur="6.569">it&amp;#39;s been so it just seemed like she</text>
  <text start="257.709" dur="4.621">couldn&amp;#39;t let go of it yeah it just</text>
  <text start="260.049" dur="5.251">seemed like it was difficult to assess</text>
  <text start="262.33" dur="4.35">her because she couldn&amp;#39;t talk but so it</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="4.35">was all sort of secondhand information</text>
  <text start="266.68" dur="6">from her husband and her daughters but</text>
  <text start="269.65" dur="4.829">it seemed like she was having a problem</text>
  <text start="272.68" dur="3.6">letting go of the anger we tried for a</text>
  <text start="274.479" dur="5.49">while and we&amp;#39;re making any progress so</text>
  <text start="276.28" dur="5.34">eventually I just quit doing that and we</text>
  <text start="279.969" dur="3.211">talked about some other stuff so it was</text>
  <text start="281.62" dur="3.21">an interesting</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="3.739">experience I certainly learned a few</text>
  <text start="284.83" dur="4.14">things and you got to do some teaching</text>
  <text start="286.919" dur="4.601">yeah that was good</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="5.069">the husband the husband and the two</text>
  <text start="291.52" dur="5.399">daughters were there and the one</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="4.681">daughter has actually started reading my</text>
  <text start="296.919" dur="3.12">latest book singing in the spirit made</text>
  <text start="298.72" dur="2.97">simple what she really liked it and had</text>
  <text start="300.039" dur="3.6">some questions about it so I got to</text>
  <text start="301.69" dur="2.599">answer the questions which was kind of</text>
  <text start="303.639" dur="2.761">cool</text>
  <text start="304.289" dur="11.16">we were going to talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="306.4" dur="12.449">forgiveness one of the things I always</text>
  <text start="315.449" dur="7.181">tell people because I have my own</text>
  <text start="318.849" dur="10.011">experience with Oh with a violent crime</text>
  <text start="322.63" dur="9.509">against me and when I was 19 and I was</text>
  <text start="328.86" dur="8.88">kind of a victim of that you know</text>
  <text start="332.139" dur="8.28">emotional victim for 20-some years and</text>
  <text start="337.74" dur="5.98">could not recall that incident without</text>
  <text start="340.419" dur="6.511">crying and I really tried not to recall</text>
  <text start="343.72" dur="5.22">it you know I was just stuffing it a lot</text>
  <text start="346.93" dur="5.12">and you just do that you try to go on</text>
  <text start="348.94" dur="8.19">and things but you know I had</text>
  <text start="352.05" dur="6.64">justifiable hurt from that but the thing</text>
  <text start="357.13" dur="4.44">is it was hurting me</text>
  <text start="358.69" dur="4.949">it wasn&amp;#39;t hurting you know any kind of</text>
  <text start="361.57" dur="4.98">unforgiveness that I was holding against</text>
  <text start="363.639" dur="5.52">this person wasn&amp;#39;t hurting him at all</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="5.869">you know he was totally out of my life</text>
  <text start="369.159" dur="5.85">and you know he went to jail and</text>
  <text start="372.419" dur="5.051">everything so I had no contact with him</text>
  <text start="375.009" dur="5.28">anymore but it was hurting my life and</text>
  <text start="377.47" dur="8.15">hurting keeping me from moving forward</text>
  <text start="380.289" dur="8.821">so when I finally came to Christ and</text>
  <text start="385.62" dur="6.28">realized how Jesus forgave everything</text>
  <text start="389.11" dur="5.13">that I did and we all do things we all</text>
  <text start="391.9" dur="5.97">need forgiveness in some way or another</text>
  <text start="394.24" dur="6.959">I just had that sort of aha moment that</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="6.57">I have to forgive this person and free</text>
  <text start="401.199" dur="6.601">myself of this burden that I&amp;#39;m carrying</text>
  <text start="404.44" dur="6.69">you know so it&amp;#39;s really as much for</text>
  <text start="407.8" dur="4.56">yourself as it is for anyone else you</text>
  <text start="411.13" dur="1.79">know if you&amp;#39;re living with a family</text>
  <text start="412.36" dur="2.03">member</text>
  <text start="412.92" dur="4.32">or you&amp;#39;re in contact with a family</text>
  <text start="414.39" dur="5.19">member who is a repeat offender let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="417.24" dur="6">say they keep doing things that are</text>
  <text start="419.58" dur="6.87">wrong and you&amp;#39;re angry or whatever so</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s this passage in Matthew 18 and</text>
  <text start="426.45" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s the parable of the unforgiving</text>
  <text start="428.64" dur="6.24">servant where a servant is forgiven a</text>
  <text start="432.09" dur="5.76">lot of death videos by his master and</text>
  <text start="434.88" dur="4.71">then he turns around and refuses to</text>
  <text start="437.85" dur="3.69">forgive the death a very small death and</text>
  <text start="439.59" dur="4.08">so to him at the end</text>
  <text start="441.54" dur="4.08">in verse 32 it says then his master</text>
  <text start="443.67" dur="3.6">after he had called him said to him you</text>
  <text start="445.62" dur="4.26">wicked servant i forgave you all the</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="4.35">debt because you begged me should you</text>
  <text start="449.88" dur="3.21">not have also have had compassion on</text>
  <text start="451.62" dur="3.9">your fellow servant just as I had pity</text>
  <text start="453.09" dur="4.98">on you his master was angry delivered</text>
  <text start="455.52" dur="4.98">him to the torturers until he should pay</text>
  <text start="458.07" dur="4.2">all that it was to him then jesus said</text>
  <text start="460.5" dur="4.29">so my heavenly Father will also do to</text>
  <text start="462.27" dur="3.77">you each if from your heart you do not</text>
  <text start="464.79" dur="3.51">forgive your brother&amp;#39;s his trespasses</text>
  <text start="466.04" dur="5.71">this is a really interesting passage</text>
  <text start="468.3" dur="7.53">because it says that his master turned</text>
  <text start="471.75" dur="6.36">him over to the torturers Wow yeah so</text>
  <text start="475.83" dur="7.46">and I think what happens is you you</text>
  <text start="478.11" dur="5.18">actually kind of are tormented by the</text>
  <text start="485.09" dur="6.13">but the thing is everybody is messed up</text>
  <text start="489.33" dur="5.58">in some way you know we&amp;#39;ve all done</text>
  <text start="491.22" dur="6.51">things whether it&amp;#39;s gossip or you know</text>
  <text start="494.91" dur="5.22">speaking unkindly to people or about</text>
  <text start="497.73" dur="4.47">people you know all the way to there</text>
  <text start="500.13" dur="5.07">really what we think of is really</text>
  <text start="502.2" dur="5.94">horrible sins you know rape and murder</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="5.19">and things like that so we all need</text>
  <text start="508.14" dur="4.65">forgiveness and therefore are you saying</text>
  <text start="510.39" dur="8.73">it&amp;#39;s easy to utilize the importance of</text>
  <text start="512.79" dur="9.38">the way we said it kids that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="519.12" dur="6.09">gotten forgiveness by others and</text>
  <text start="522.17" dur="5.77">definitely by Jesus in our lives and</text>
  <text start="525.21" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s important for us to extend that to</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="3.42">other people I mean and I know sometimes</text>
  <text start="529.44" dur="4.77">you can&amp;#39;t do it right away it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="531.36" dur="6.48">hard to let go of something if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.21" dur="4.38">fresh but the sooner you do the better</text>
  <text start="537.84" dur="4.45">you&amp;#39;re gonna feel</text>
  <text start="538.59" dur="6.07">and and and you will not give</text>
  <text start="542.29" dur="4.979">enemy that foothold to come in and</text>
  <text start="544.66" dur="5.97">afflict you with some sort of physical</text>
  <text start="547.269" dur="5.76">thing great you know just try to keep in</text>
  <text start="550.63" dur="5.37">mind that the the person who is sitting</text>
  <text start="553.029" dur="5.73">against you is messing up and Jesus</text>
  <text start="556" dur="5.639">forgives them so kind of like who are</text>
  <text start="558.759" dur="6.601">you two to keep continue to hold that</text>
  <text start="561.639" dur="6.75">against them when he is not right I</text>
  <text start="565.36" dur="4.849">think it is helpful at least for me to</text>
  <text start="568.389" dur="4.981">remember that reason why people do</text>
  <text start="570.209" dur="4.961">things against us is because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="573.37" dur="3.75">wounded and messed up and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="575.17" dur="5.609">abused and they&amp;#39;ve been neglected so</text>
  <text start="577.12" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re reacting out of their are their</text>
  <text start="580.779" dur="4.17">own hurt and wood in this and if nothing</text>
  <text start="583.48" dur="4.44">else that&amp;#39;s a reason to be a little more</text>
  <text start="584.949" dur="6.12">compassionate towards people so you got</text>
  <text start="587.92" dur="6.719">into an interesting book yesterday yeah</text>
  <text start="591.069" dur="5.96">as we mentioned probably before I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="594.639" dur="6.87">going through this coaching program</text>
  <text start="597.029" dur="6.851">online and this book was recommended</text>
  <text start="601.509" dur="4.5">just started reading it we&amp;#39;ve made</text>
  <text start="603.88" dur="3.56">reference at a previous podcast to</text>
  <text start="606.009" dur="5.13">something called the inner mean girl</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="7.36">yeah and this book is about reforming</text>
  <text start="611.139" dur="6.031">your inner mean girl so the the idea is</text>
  <text start="614.8" dur="3.659">that we all have this critical voice</text>
  <text start="617.17" dur="3.75">inside of us</text>
  <text start="618.459" dur="5.911">that is saying you know you&amp;#39;re not good</text>
  <text start="620.92" dur="5.609">enough you&amp;#39;re ugly or that you&amp;#39;re not as</text>
  <text start="624.37" dur="2.61">good as so and so whenever nobody likes</text>
  <text start="626.529" dur="2.61">you</text>
  <text start="626.98" dur="5.039">nobody likes you hears about you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="629.139" dur="7.14">never get married you&amp;#39;ll never you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="632.019" dur="7.56">the man you&amp;#39;re phony yeah so we know we</text>
  <text start="636.279" dur="5.49">know we have these voices and of course</text>
  <text start="639.579" dur="5.13">in the Christian community we think of</text>
  <text start="641.769" dur="6.361">this and the voice of the enemy and it</text>
  <text start="644.709" dur="6.781">is what it is but some people you know</text>
  <text start="648.13" dur="7.59">this is sort of I would stay along the</text>
  <text start="651.49" dur="7.11">new-age line you know they just think of</text>
  <text start="655.72" dur="6.059">it as you&amp;#39;re an inner voice inside you</text>
  <text start="658.6" dur="7.049">that you can you can kind of transform</text>
  <text start="661.779" dur="6.18">and it really as well as we were reading</text>
  <text start="665.649" dur="5.94">this book I was reading it aloud at</text>
  <text start="667.959" dur="7.031">dinner time to my husband and let me</text>
  <text start="671.589" dur="5.791">make a disclaimer first</text>
  <text start="674.99" dur="6.77">the thing that you have to understand is</text>
  <text start="677.38" dur="6.97">we as believers do not have a monopoly</text>
  <text start="681.76" dur="5.23">or a corner on the market for wisdom</text>
  <text start="684.35" dur="5.25">we really don&amp;#39;t we would like to think</text>
  <text start="686.99" dur="5.4">that we do non-christians have actually</text>
  <text start="689.6" dur="6.21">figured out some stuff that we have yet</text>
  <text start="692.39" dur="5.15">to figure out and this book is a really</text>
  <text start="695.81" dur="5.61">really good example of how</text>
  <text start="697.54" dur="6.58">non-christians can are able to discern</text>
  <text start="701.42" dur="5.13">the truth of a situation and are able to</text>
  <text start="704.12" dur="4.83">pretty accurately assess what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="706.55" dur="6.27">and then even prescribe a treatment that</text>
  <text start="708.95" dur="8.13">is essentially what really talented</text>
  <text start="712.82" dur="8.73">Christian counselors are doing yeah it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="717.08" dur="6.8">the secular equivalent what you have to</text>
  <text start="721.55" dur="5.22">do in your read books like this is</text>
  <text start="723.88" dur="6.16">transpose some words so they use words</text>
  <text start="726.77" dur="4.86">like your inner wisdom and whenever you</text>

  <text start="738.47" dur="5.81">about you know either a demon or some</text>
  <text start="741.23" dur="5.7">other voice so the language of the book</text>
  <text start="744.28" dur="5.41">needs a little bit of translation but</text>
  <text start="746.93" dur="6.36">the concepts are amazing so us during</text>
  <text start="749.69" dur="5.55">the genesis of your inner mean girl as a</text>
  <text start="753.29" dur="4.56">woman you certainly weren&amp;#39;t born</text>
  <text start="755.24" dur="4.86">programmed to compare yourself judge</text>
  <text start="757.85" dur="4.62">yourself and feel guilty or inferior</text>
  <text start="760.1" dur="3.69">right it&amp;#39;s not like when you were a baby</text>
  <text start="762.47" dur="4.41">you laid around in your bassinet</text>
  <text start="763.79" dur="5.85">comparing your thighs to the babies next</text>
  <text start="766.88" dur="5.79">to you or as a toddler we&amp;#39;re concerned</text>
  <text start="769.64" dur="5.4">that your naps were a waste of time you</text>
  <text start="772.67" dur="5.25">are not born hardwired to be hard on</text>
  <text start="775.04" dur="5.16">yourself you were born pre-programmed to</text>
  <text start="777.92" dur="4.89">love yourself but along the way some</text>
  <text start="780.2" dur="5.34">wires got crossed your inner mean girl</text>
  <text start="782.81" dur="4.64">got formed and you got trapped in a</text>
  <text start="785.54" dur="4.74">cycle of thoughts habits and patterns</text>
  <text start="787.45" dur="6.43">that has been almost impossible to work</text>
  <text start="790.28" dur="5.7">yourself out of until now your inner</text>
  <text start="793.88" dur="5.04">mean girl is part of a human experience</text>
  <text start="795.98" dur="5.34">and she is also a part of you so you</text>
  <text start="798.92" dur="4.71">can&amp;#39;t kill her off even if you tried and</text>
  <text start="801.32" dur="5.34">we don&amp;#39;t want you to try and run from</text>
  <text start="803.63" dur="4.069">her either we want you to run straight</text>
  <text start="806.66" dur="3.289">toward her and</text>
  <text start="807.699" dur="4.32">love her because as it turns out your</text>
  <text start="809.949" dur="4.68">inner mean girl doesn&amp;#39;t mean to hurt you</text>
  <text start="812.019" dur="4.891">she actually wants to protect you</text>
  <text start="814.629" dur="6.36">so should we take a break here yeah go</text>
  <text start="816.91" dur="7.469">party so in this little beginning</text>
  <text start="820.989" dur="6.6">opening paragraph two they discuss the</text>
  <text start="824.379" dur="7.44">idea that the inner mean girl is a</text>
  <text start="827.589" dur="6.93">sensual part of you that she was formed</text>
  <text start="831.819" dur="7.8">at early age and she&amp;#39;s there to help</text>
  <text start="834.519" dur="10.23">protect you so this sounds like an altar</text>
  <text start="839.619" dur="7.65">yeah so in inner healing we know that</text>
  <text start="844.749" dur="4.71">when people suffer emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="847.269" dur="5.91">usually when they&amp;#39;re young they form</text>
  <text start="849.459" dur="7.05">altars and fragments altars are actually</text>
  <text start="853.179" dur="6.81">alternate personalities and we know that</text>
  <text start="856.509" dur="6.39">the reason why altars exist is to</text>
  <text start="859.989" dur="5.37">protect the core of the personality so</text>
  <text start="862.899" dur="5.13">these folks are actually right on track</text>
  <text start="865.359" dur="5.13">with the essential teachings of inner</text>
  <text start="868.029" dur="6.27">healing right you develop a wounded</text>
  <text start="870.489" dur="6.361">child inside you right and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="874.299" dur="6.301">protective mechanism it&amp;#39;s not like some</text>

  <text start="890.249" dur="5.77">overdoing under expressing and</text>
  <text start="892.899" dur="5.46">procrastinating in her mind serves one</text>
  <text start="896.019" dur="4.26">mission protecting you she actually</text>
  <text start="898.359" dur="4.47">loves you so much that she has devoted</text>

  <text start="909.579" dur="3.69">committed to keeping you from pain she</text>
  <text start="911.679" dur="3.02">is also the one who fills your head with</text>
  <text start="913.269" dur="3.48">thoughts that hurt you</text>
  <text start="914.699" dur="6.25">compelling you into actions that</text>
  <text start="916.749" dur="6.06">sabotage and sacrifice you well at some</text>

  <text start="1365.459" dur="5.85">you know puts on you and how it is</text>
  <text start="1368.759" dur="6.78">formed and then how you reformed right</text>
  <text start="1371.309" dur="5.85">first then it&amp;#39;s like step two is exposed</text>
  <text start="1375.539" dur="5.7">your inner Mean Girls tricks and</text>
  <text start="1377.159" dur="6.51">triggers triggers are triggers gosh</text>
  <text start="1381.239" dur="5.97">really no they use that same word that</text>
  <text start="1383.669" dur="5.521">we use what we try to do in inner</text>
  <text start="1387.209" dur="4.981">healing is we&amp;#39;re actually trying to</text>
  <text start="1389.19" dur="6.239">trigger the alter to come up or the</text>
  <text start="1392.19" dur="5.659">inner mean girl and there&amp;#39;s a chance</text>
  <text start="1395.429" dur="4.23">yeah there&amp;#39;s terminology varies</text>
  <text start="1397.849" dur="4.3">depending on what culture you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1399.659" dur="5.58">speaking in but what you try to do with</text>
  <text start="1402.149" dur="6.03">at least what I&amp;#39;ve had success with with</text>
  <text start="1405.239" dur="5.701">emotional healing is you bring up events</text>
  <text start="1408.179" dur="5.85">that trigger the inner mean girl or the</text>
  <text start="1410.94" dur="5.969">alter child is feeling to come up they</text>
  <text start="1414.029" dur="5.22">feel the emotions and temporarily in</text>
  <text start="1416.909" dur="4.47">that personality there the persona takes</text>
  <text start="1419.249" dur="4.71">over your body and your mind and your</text>
  <text start="1421.379" dur="5.64">soul in there the one thats talking so</text>
  <text start="1423.959" dur="4.741">you talk to them and there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="1427.019" dur="3">different ways you can go one of the</text>
  <text start="1428.7" dur="3.87">things that Steve Harmon found when he</text>
  <text start="1430.019" dur="5.82">was doing this if a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="1432.57" dur="6.679">to associate him identities or is he was</text>
  <text start="1435.839" dur="5.76">asking Jesus you know how do I get this</text>
  <text start="1439.249" dur="5.77">essentially how do I reform their inner</text>
  <text start="1441.599" dur="6.06">mean girl and Jesus said love them and</text>
  <text start="1445.019" dur="6.78">he found that loving just doing acts of</text>
  <text start="1447.659" dur="7.2">love for these alters and you know soul</text>
  <text start="1451.799" dur="5.13">fragments is the best way to get them to</text>
  <text start="1454.859" dur="4.56">mature and grow up and to reform them</text>
  <text start="1456.929" dur="4.371">really his love he&amp;#39;s essentially doing</text>
  <text start="1459.419" dur="3.501">discipleship</text>
  <text start="1461.3" dur="4.56">teaching them about God attention a lot</text>
  <text start="1462.92" dur="5.28">Jesus teaching them the truth and</text>
  <text start="1465.86" dur="5.25">replacing the lies because of the most</text>
  <text start="1468.2" dur="5.55">of these wounded soul fragments and</text>
  <text start="1471.11" dur="5.58">halters and children have been terribly</text>
  <text start="1473.75" dur="4.92">deceived by demonic lies and so they</text>
  <text start="1476.69" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t know the truth so part of the</text>
  <text start="1478.67" dur="4.17">process of reformation is lugging them</text>
  <text start="1480.95" dur="4.68">the other part is teaching them the</text>
  <text start="1482.84" dur="7.35">truth we should mention we have a friend</text>
  <text start="1485.63" dur="9.21">who calls it dissociative identity gift</text>
  <text start="1490.19" dur="7.41">race yes because it is a protective</text>
  <text start="1494.84" dur="4.35">mechanism and sometimes it&amp;#39;s the only</text>
  <text start="1497.6" dur="4.56">reason that the person is still alive</text>
  <text start="1499.19" dur="7.37">yeah that they have been able to</text>
  <text start="1502.16" dur="10.89">fragment and partition off the wounds</text>
  <text start="1506.56" dur="7.96">into other personalities so yeah you</text>
  <text start="1513.05" dur="3.36">know we don&amp;#39;t want to stigmatize or</text>
  <text start="1514.52" dur="6.12">anything like that it&amp;#39;s we believe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1516.41" dur="5.91">something that God gave us and I&amp;#39;ll go</text>
  <text start="1520.64" dur="3.66">out on a limb and say that I believe</text>
  <text start="1522.32" dur="5.27">every single person walk in the face of</text>
  <text start="1524.3" dur="7.2">the earth has some degree of either</text>
  <text start="1527.59" dur="6.85">fragmentation right or outright halters</text>
  <text start="1531.5" dur="6.21">right so I think it&amp;#39;s really hard to go</text>
  <text start="1534.44" dur="5.85">through life and not develop these</text>
  <text start="1537.71" dur="4.11">wounded parts of your soul that need to</text>
  <text start="1540.29" dur="3.6">be healed I think everybody has them</text>
  <text start="1541.82" dur="3.92">yeah it&amp;#39;s the one degree or not I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1543.89" dur="4.11">imagine anyone having such an awesome</text>
  <text start="1545.74" dur="3.88">beautiful blessed life that they never</text>
  <text start="1548" dur="6.78">run into any kind of emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="1549.62" dur="7.14">that and then there&amp;#39;s a step three</text>
  <text start="1554.78" dur="3.72">discover what motivates your inner mean</text>
  <text start="1556.76" dur="4.8">girl so I&amp;#39;m sure if you can figure that</text>
  <text start="1558.5" dur="6.93">out that can help in the process and</text>
  <text start="1561.56" dur="6.3">then spired action bring your inner mean</text>
  <text start="1565.43" dur="6.3">girl to life make your inner mean girl</text>
  <text start="1567.86" dur="6.15">expose and part two is meet your inner</text>
  <text start="1571.73" dur="5.55">wisdom so this is where you get to</text>
  <text start="1574.01" dur="5.94">listen to we believe God&amp;#39;s wisdom the</text>
  <text start="1577.28" dur="6.89">Holy Spirit and turn up the volume on</text>
  <text start="1579.95" dur="6.9">your inner wisdom so make that override</text>
  <text start="1584.17" dur="4.54">the critical it&amp;#39;s you choosing to walk</text>
  <text start="1586.85" dur="4.89">in the spirit instead of walking you</text>
  <text start="1588.71" dur="6.66">know from the flesh believing the truth</text>
  <text start="1591.74" dur="7.65">and not believing the lies make your</text>
  <text start="1595.37" dur="10.189">inner wisdom your most trusted Ally then</text>
  <text start="1599.39" dur="10.08">part 3 make shift happen miss shift yeah</text>
  <text start="1605.559" dur="6.131">give up himself bullying for good assign</text>
  <text start="1609.47" dur="3.99">your ear mean girl her new job so I</text>
  <text start="1611.69" dur="4.82">guess that&amp;#39;s the idea is you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1613.46" dur="5.31">kind of shift her into a new role</text>
  <text start="1616.51" dur="3.91">because she&amp;#39;s gonna remain there and</text>
  <text start="1618.77" dur="3.75">then there&amp;#39;s achievement junkie</text>
  <text start="1620.42" dur="4.83">comparison queen okay those are the list</text>
  <text start="1622.52" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s the list of people right sounds</text>
  <text start="1625.25" dur="4.5">interesting and I think it&amp;#39;ll help me</text>
  <text start="1626.87" dur="5.52">because I I am one of these people who</text>
  <text start="1629.75" dur="6.12">has this in inner voice that is telling</text>

  <text start="1753.89" dur="3.45">you were you were taking all it was</text>
  <text start="1755.78" dur="2.94">about disappointment getting over</text>
  <text start="1757.34" dur="5.42">discipline they&amp;#39;re bouncing back from</text>
  <text start="1758.72" dur="6.75">disappointment and you&amp;#39;re basically</text>
  <text start="1762.76" dur="5.71">taking all this all these emotions all</text>
  <text start="1765.47" dur="5.579">these feelings all this grudges you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1768.47" dur="4.56">holding or whatever is going on the need</text>
  <text start="1771.049" dur="3.931">to hold on to it in the future packaging</text>
  <text start="1773.03" dur="9">it all up in a scrapbook and handing it</text>
  <text start="1774.98" dur="8.939">over to a wise being handing it over to</text>
  <text start="1782.03" dur="3.99">a wise being and you&amp;#39;re saying here you</text>
  <text start="1783.919" dur="3.721">take this off of me I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1786.02" dur="4.92">carry this around anymore which is</text>
  <text start="1787.64" dur="4.919">exactly what I do in inner healing right</text>
  <text start="1790.94" dur="5.43">I ask people tell me the emotion you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1792.559" dur="7.98">feeling okay get wise loving give it to</text>
  <text start="1796.37" dur="6.36">this wise loving Jesus let him take it</text>
  <text start="1800.539" dur="3.061">away from you because and then tell him</text>
  <text start="1802.73" dur="2.819">you don&amp;#39;t want it anymore</text>
  <text start="1803.6" dur="4.47">and it&amp;#39;s really this actually the same</text>
  <text start="1805.549" dur="7.081">thing yeah you know it&amp;#39;s just different</text>
  <text start="1808.07" dur="7.05">words I mean you know Christians will</text>
  <text start="1812.63" dur="4.86">immediately see that it&amp;#39;s Jesus or that</text>
  <text start="1815.12" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;s God you know people who don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1817.49" dur="7.14">Jesus give them give him a replacement</text>
  <text start="1820.88" dur="5.64">you know name for him just so they can</text>
  <text start="1824.63" dur="4.65">do it you know so they can turn it over</text>
  <text start="1826.52" dur="4.8">and then actually in that exercise there</text>
  <text start="1829.28" dur="3.629">were people it was kind of a live</text>
  <text start="1831.32" dur="3.989">webinar so there were people who were</text>
  <text start="1832.909" dur="4.441">participating in it and there were</text>
  <text start="1835.309" dur="4.681">people who couldn&amp;#39;t let go they they</text>
  <text start="1837.35" dur="5.04">came on afterwards some of them said it</text>
  <text start="1839.99" dur="4.2">was wonderful experience I was able to</text>
  <text start="1842.39" dur="3.69">let go of all this stuff and I feel so</text>
  <text start="1844.19" dur="4.859">much better and there were a few people</text>
  <text start="1846.08" dur="3.3">who said I couldn&amp;#39;t do it I couldn&amp;#39;t let</text>
  <text start="1849.049" dur="2.791">it go</text>
  <text start="1849.38" dur="5.61">I started thinking who would I be if I</text>
  <text start="1851.84" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t have this anymore and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1854.99" dur="4.35">another whole issue</text>
  <text start="1857.21" dur="3.9">where people kind of hold on to their</text>
  <text start="1859.34" dur="4.65">junk because they don&amp;#39;t know who they</text>
  <text start="1861.11" dur="6.419">are without it right but it was very</text>
  <text start="1863.99" dur="5.76">interesting to see that now I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
