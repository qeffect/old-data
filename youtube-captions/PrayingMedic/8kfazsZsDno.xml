  <text start="112.92" dur="6.54">don&amp;#39;t want to mess this up the first 10</text>
  <text start="115.92" dur="6.989">verses of Luke chapter 5 describe what</text>
  <text start="119.46" dur="6.38">happened to Peter the Apostle when he</text>
  <text start="122.909" dur="8.041">allowed his workplace to be a platform</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="7.42">for the Ministry of Jesus after the Lord</text>
  <text start="130.95" dur="5.25">taught from Peters boat</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="7.05">so I&amp;#39;m gonna editorialize here a little</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="6.72">bit Jesus was on the Sea of Galilee and</text>
  <text start="140.31" dur="7.019">there was sort of a natural Coliseum</text>
  <text start="142.92" dur="7.17">near the shore thousands of people had</text>
  <text start="147.329" dur="6.151">gathered to hear Jesus teach and Jesus</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="5.1">said Peter let&amp;#39;s get in the boat and</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="3.66">let&amp;#39;s put out a little ways from the</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="4.65">shore so they did Jesus got in the boat</text>
  <text start="157.14" dur="4.05">he stood in the bow and Peter moved the</text>
  <text start="159.84" dur="3.06">boat out away from shore just a little</text>
  <text start="161.19" dur="4.139">bit so there&amp;#39;s a natural amphitheater</text>
  <text start="162.9" dur="8.009">and Jesus starts teaching so he teaches</text>
  <text start="165.329" dur="10.25">the audience from Peters boat what did</text>
  <text start="170.909" dur="7.11">Peter do for a living he was a fisherman</text>
  <text start="175.579" dur="4.69">Peter James and John had a fishing</text>
  <text start="178.019" dur="4.921">business that was their business that</text>
  <text start="180.269" dur="5.731">was their workplace right</text>
  <text start="182.94" dur="6.57">they allowed Jesus to use their boat to</text>
  <text start="186" dur="7.849">preach from now watch what happens so</text>
  <text start="189.51" dur="7.41">the Lord taught from Peters boat after</text>
  <text start="193.849" dur="5.881">telling Jesus that he had been fishing</text>
  <text start="196.92" dur="5.67">all night and had not caught anything</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="5.53">Jesus told him put out farther and drop</text>
  <text start="202.59" dur="4.769">your nuts now Peters a fisherman and</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="3.809">Jesus is at rabbi and Peter&amp;#39;s thinking</text>
  <text start="207.359" dur="2.821">what do you know about fishing you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="209.069" dur="2.461">rabbi you don&amp;#39;t know anything about</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="3.57">fishing we&amp;#39;ve been fishing all night</text>
  <text start="211.53" dur="7.47">we&amp;#39;re not going to catch anything Jesus</text>
  <text start="213.75" dur="7.319">said drop your nets he was astounded</text>
  <text start="219" dur="3.69">when the catch was so great that it</text>
  <text start="221.069" dur="3.6">began to sink the boat</text>
  <text start="222.69" dur="6.65">requiring help from the others to bring</text>
  <text start="224.669" dur="7.65">it in god blessed Peter James and John</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="4.75">with an immediate increase in their</text>
  <text start="232.319" dur="4.32">business when they allowed their</text>
  <text start="234.09" dur="6.179">occupation to be used by him for their</text>
  <text start="236.639" dur="6.66">ministry in the same way that Jesus</text>
  <text start="240.269" dur="5.461">blessed the fishermen God wants to bless</text>
  <text start="243.299" dur="5.84">us when we&amp;#39;re willing to be used by him</text>
  <text start="245.73" dur="10.08">where we work all right</text>
  <text start="249.139" dur="9.28">so God is interested in revealing</text>
  <text start="255.81" dur="5.609">himself to the world through us in the</text>
  <text start="258.419" dur="6.361">workplace and I have seen thousands of</text>
  <text start="261.419" dur="4.561">people healed in the last eight or nine</text>
  <text start="264.78" dur="3.57">years</text>
  <text start="265.98" dur="4.41">many of them healed in the workplace</text>
  <text start="268.35" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ve prayed for thousands of people in</text>
  <text start="270.39" dur="4.35">the ambulance patients that have</text>
  <text start="272.91" dur="4.56">transported I prayed for doctors and</text>
  <text start="274.74" dur="4.74">nurses and respiratory therapists and</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="3.93">co-workers and seen a lot of people</text>
  <text start="279.48" dur="6.48">healed I&amp;#39;m gonna give you a couple of</text>
  <text start="281.4" dur="8.04">testimonies so I was doing some training</text>
  <text start="285.96" dur="6.3">a few years ago it&amp;#39;s probably four years</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="5.28">ago I think I was at doing training we</text>
  <text start="292.26" dur="5.76">were training new EMTs who new hires and</text>
  <text start="294.72" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;re doing training ride and part of</text>
  <text start="298.02" dur="5.31">the way through the day our EMT trainee</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="4.26">was running around the ambulance wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="303.33" dur="4.56">paying attention and smashed his knee</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="4.47">into this big steel bumper of the</text>
  <text start="307.89" dur="4.05">ambulance and he was limping around the</text>
  <text start="309.75" dur="6.24">rest of the day had a lot of pain and</text>
  <text start="311.94" dur="6.33">some swelling in his knee and at the end</text>
  <text start="315.99" dur="4.26">of the day we had some time some</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="4.29">downtime between calls were hanging out</text>
  <text start="320.25" dur="3.96">talking and I started telling them about</text>
  <text start="322.56" dur="2.19">the people that had seen healed an</text>
  <text start="324.21" dur="3.87">ambulance</text>
  <text start="324.75" dur="4.41">and so this EMT is listening to me tell</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="4.62">all these stories about people getting</text>
  <text start="329.16" dur="5.91">healed and he said hey man what about me</text>
  <text start="332.7" dur="3.48">can I get healed my knee is like is my</text>
  <text start="335.07" dur="3.72">knee is killing me man</text>

  <text start="338.79" dur="6.33">yeah okay so we&amp;#39;ll get you healed so he</text>
  <text start="342.09" dur="6.42">sat on the bench seat next to me I put</text>
  <text start="345.12" dur="8.01">my hand on his knee and as I have taught</text>
  <text start="348.51" dur="8.28">in my previous messages I released power</text>
  <text start="353.13" dur="6.54">I just put my hand there and I believed</text>
  <text start="356.79" dur="5.55">that power the power of God is gonna</text>
  <text start="359.67" dur="4.95">flow through me out of me and into his</text>
  <text start="362.34" dur="5.45">knee so I put my hand there over his</text>
  <text start="364.62" dur="4.98">knee about an inch or two away and</text>
  <text start="367.79" dur="3.91">that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="369.6" dur="5.28">Jesus&amp;#39;s disciples were not teachers or</text>
  <text start="371.7" dur="4.68">rabbis or politicians or experts in</text>
  <text start="374.88" dur="4.32">anything they were just ordinary people</text>
  <text start="376.38" dur="6.81">and you do not have to go to ministry</text>
  <text start="379.2" dur="5.7">school or Bible College in order to work</text>
  <text start="383.19" dur="5.21">miracles and get people healed anyone</text>

  <text start="396.21" dur="3.6">in his knee commanded the ligaments and</text>

  <text start="401.58" dur="4.02">commanded the missus to be healed and a</text>
  <text start="404.28" dur="1.98">couple of minutes later he gets up and</text>

  <text start="748.16" dur="5.76">talked that I said well I&amp;#39;m a Christian</text>
  <text start="750.47" dur="6.15">and the Holy Spirit the Spirit of God</text>
  <text start="753.92" dur="4.38">lives inside of me and Jesus gave us</text>
  <text start="756.62" dur="4.17">power and authority to heal the sick and</text>
  <text start="758.3" dur="4.44">I released that power and I used that</text>

  <text start="783.62" dur="4.38">vision and she said it&amp;#39;s pretty bad so</text>
  <text start="785.63" dur="3.75">take your glasses off and we were</text>
  <text start="788" dur="3.42">sitting in the ambulance and I had her</text>
  <text start="789.38" dur="4.5">take her glasses off and so she could</text>
  <text start="791.42" dur="4.23">read a sign that was about fifty feet</text>
  <text start="793.88" dur="3.41">away from us in the parking lot she</text>
  <text start="795.65" dur="4.43">couldn&amp;#39;t read it it was all blurry</text>

  <text start="800.08" dur="7.41">my hand above her eyes right up here</text>
  <text start="803.71" dur="7.38">just put my hand there and I released</text>
  <text start="807.49" dur="6.15">power by faith that&amp;#39;s how we release</text>
  <text start="811.09" dur="5.49">power the power of God lives inside of</text>
  <text start="813.64" dur="5.64">us all the Spirit lives inside of us by</text>
  <text start="816.58" dur="5.43">faith we open up like something like a</text>
  <text start="819.28" dur="5.67">valve and the power of God flows out of</text>
  <text start="822.01" dur="6.18">us into them so I put my hand right by</text>
  <text start="824.95" dur="6">her eyes and I just believed that she</text>
  <text start="828.19" dur="4.59">was going to receive normal vision she</text>
  <text start="830.95" dur="4.74">said well that&amp;#39;s crazy my my eyelids are</text>
  <text start="832.78" dur="6.15">burning she said my eyelids feel really</text>
  <text start="835.69" dur="6.42">warm right so she could feel the power</text>
  <text start="838.93" dur="4.8">of God flowing out of me into her so I</text>
  <text start="842.11" dur="4.83">said okay just hang on a second let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="843.73" dur="5.1">keep doing this so I continue just</text>
  <text start="846.94" dur="4.41">release I said I command your eyes to be</text>
  <text start="848.83" dur="4.38">healed I command the lenses to be healed</text>
  <text start="851.35" dur="4.71">the corneas to be healed I command your</text>
  <text start="853.21" dur="6.54">eye to have normal shake spirit of</text>
  <text start="856.06" dur="5.87">blindness I command you to go a couple</text>
  <text start="859.75" dur="4.5">minutes later she takes off her glasses</text>
  <text start="861.93" dur="3.94">she looks at the sign of the parking lot</text>
  <text start="864.25" dur="3.27">goes oh my gosh are you kidding me I can</text>
  <text start="865.87" dur="3.06">read that sign perfectly now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="867.52" dur="4.29">even need my glasses anymore</text>
  <text start="868.93" dur="7.82">her eyes were healed like that all right</text>
  <text start="871.81" dur="8.91">this is how I have seen many many</text>
  <text start="876.75" dur="7.96">co-workers healed of everything you can</text>
  <text start="880.72" dur="6.87">think of migraine headaches vision</text>
  <text start="884.71" dur="6.87">problems back pain broken ankles you</text>
  <text start="887.59" dur="10.32">name it there is nothing that God will</text>
  <text start="891.58" dur="9.96">not heal so and this is all happening</text>
  <text start="897.91" dur="8.19">for me in the workplace where I work</text>
  <text start="901.54" dur="7.65">right so a lot of people want to share</text>
  <text start="906.1" dur="6.99">the truth and the reality of God with</text>
  <text start="909.19" dur="7.2">people that they work with but in the</text>
  <text start="913.09" dur="6.3">workplace generally speaking you know</text>
  <text start="916.39" dur="5.37">witnessing to people at work or telling</text>
  <text start="919.39" dur="4.44">people about Jesus or you know trying to</text>
  <text start="921.76" dur="6.42">proselytize people to your belief system</text>
  <text start="923.83" dur="7.92">whether it&amp;#39;s Islam or if you&amp;#39;re know if</text>

  <text start="931.75" dur="5.71">trying to get people to become a</text>
  <text start="935.39" dur="4.23">believer in your religious system is</text>
  <text start="937.46" dur="3.75">kind of frowned upon in the workplace</text>
  <text start="939.62" dur="7.86">people don&amp;#39;t usually like it all that</text>
  <text start="941.21" dur="9.45">much however I have found that rather</text>
  <text start="947.48" dur="5.58">than witnessing to people about Jesus I</text>
  <text start="950.66" dur="4.13">just ask people if they want to be</text>
  <text start="953.06" dur="4.53">healed when we talk about dreams</text>
  <text start="954.79" dur="4.99">although I have found that healing is a</text>
  <text start="957.59" dur="4.44">great way to open up a door of</text>
  <text start="959.78" dur="4.95">conversation about God you get somebody</text>
  <text start="962.03" dur="4.23">healed at work and it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="964.73" dur="3.81">different from sitting there and bashing</text>
  <text start="966.26" dur="4.2">them with the Bible for 10 minutes when</text>
  <text start="968.54" dur="4.35">I see people healed at work they want to</text>
  <text start="970.46" dur="4.5">know how did you do it who is this Jesus</text>
  <text start="972.89" dur="4.2">what&amp;#39;s the Holy Spirit will tell me</text>
  <text start="974.96" dur="3.39">about this power you know can I do this</text>
  <text start="977.09" dur="3.96">is this something you can teach me how</text>
  <text start="978.35" dur="5.91">to do when you get somebody healed at</text>
  <text start="981.05" dur="4.98">work it pretty much gives you the</text>
  <text start="984.26" dur="5.37">microphone and you can talk and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="986.03" dur="5.97">gonna ask you questions and and you get</text>
  <text start="989.63" dur="5.37">a couple three four or five people</text>
  <text start="992" dur="6.12">healed at work word is going to get</text>
  <text start="995" dur="5.76">around and people are gonna come to you</text>
  <text start="998.12" dur="6.3">and they&amp;#39;re going to ask you okay I</text>
  <text start="1000.76" dur="5.19">heard from Matt and Sue and Cheryl and</text>
  <text start="1004.42" dur="1.95">Jim they all said that you got them</text>
  <text start="1005.95" dur="2.94">healed</text>
  <text start="1006.37" dur="4.47">I need healing for something can you</text>
  <text start="1008.89" dur="3.99">pray for me so people are gonna come to</text>
  <text start="1010.84" dur="4.8">you for healing they&amp;#39;re gonna come to</text>
  <text start="1012.88" dur="4.83">you for prayer when word gets around and</text>
  <text start="1015.64" dur="4.41">all it takes is a couple of testimonies</text>
  <text start="1017.71" dur="4.47">from a few co-workers who&amp;#39;ve been healed</text>
  <text start="1020.05" dur="4.32">and people will start coming to you for</text>
  <text start="1022.18" dur="5.49">healing it&amp;#39;s happened to me I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="1024.37" dur="6.06">people message me text me and get a hold</text>
  <text start="1027.67" dur="7.14">of me at work because they knew that I</text>
  <text start="1030.43" dur="10.53">had gotten other people healed so there</text>
  <text start="1034.81" dur="8.1">is a great value to bringing healing to</text>
  <text start="1040.96" dur="5.87">the workplace now I&amp;#39;d like to talk a</text>
  <text start="1042.91" dur="3.92">little bit about the legalities of that</text>

  <text start="1078.29" dur="6">some employers have more or less been</text>
  <text start="1080.96" dur="5.82">forced to allow Muslims time of prayer</text>

  <text start="1744.28" dur="7.14">was above the scope of practice of the</text>
  <text start="1746.49" dur="6.25">facility that sent the patient so we had</text>
  <text start="1751.42" dur="6.3">a couple of nurses going with us</text>

  <text start="1770.08" dur="4.11">are open and they&amp;#39;re freaking out we</text>
  <text start="1772.45" dur="3.24">roll a patient into the elevator with</text>
  <text start="1774.19" dur="3.51">two nurses I&amp;#39;ve got a couple of security</text>

  <text start="1780.76" dur="5.4">the patient is I can tell is freaking</text>
  <text start="1782.89" dur="6.69">out and I told I asked the patient I</text>
  <text start="1786.16" dur="6.6">said do you want me to pray for you and</text>
  <text start="1789.58" dur="6.38">the patient nodded their head so I just</text>
  <text start="1792.76" dur="4.98">you know took some time said a prayer</text>
  <text start="1795.96" dur="3.73">commanded the bleeding to stop</text>
  <text start="1797.74" dur="3.72">and I&amp;#39;m kind of looking around at the</text>
  <text start="1799.69" dur="3.6">nurses and the nurses had their heads</text>
  <text start="1801.46" dur="3.27">bowed and they&amp;#39;re like you know moment</text>
  <text start="1803.29" dur="3.629">of silence for the for the patient we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1804.73" dur="4.8">praying and everybody was cool with it</text>
  <text start="1806.919" dur="5.371">but it was one of those situations where</text>
  <text start="1809.53" dur="4.29">I felt like I needed to pray and I felt</text>
  <text start="1812.29" dur="3.24">like it&amp;#39;s gonna be a little risky</text>
  <text start="1813.82" dur="4.2">because we&amp;#39;re not in the ambulance we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1815.53" dur="6.09">in the elevator but it was just a</text>
  <text start="1818.02" dur="5.67">situation where you know I needed to do</text>
  <text start="1821.62" dur="3.54">what I needed to do so as soon as I got</text>
  <text start="1823.69" dur="3.27">done with that call I went back to my</text>
  <text start="1825.16" dur="4.74">station I got ahold of my manager and I</text>
  <text start="1826.96" dur="4.95">said hey Scott yeah so about keeping</text>
  <text start="1829.9" dur="3.81">that stuff inside the ambulance you know</text>
  <text start="1831.91" dur="4.259">sometimes it&amp;#39;s not impossible to do that</text>
  <text start="1833.71" dur="4.2">I did have to pray with a patient in an</text>
  <text start="1836.169" dur="4.38">elevator with some nurses around me and</text>
  <text start="1837.91" dur="4.53">I just want to let you know I did it and</text>
  <text start="1840.549" dur="3.861">it&amp;#39;s not because I was just trying to be</text>
  <text start="1842.44" dur="4.109">you know rebellious or anything</text>
  <text start="1844.41" dur="3.49">it&amp;#39;s got laughed about it he thought it</text>
