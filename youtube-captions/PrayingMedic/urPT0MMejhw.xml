  <text start="105.539" dur="5.25">had to carry people to their cars</text>
  <text start="108.14" dur="5.289">because they still hadn&amp;#39;t composed</text>
  <text start="110.789" dur="6.36">themselves enough to walk out on their</text>

  <text start="129.39" dur="6.24">great now 20 plus years later that is</text>
  <text start="133.59" dur="5.91">happening all over the United States and</text>
  <text start="135.63" dur="6.419">all over the world actually back in</text>
  <text start="139.5" dur="5.31">nineteen in the 1990s it was happening</text>
  <text start="142.049" dur="4.53">nowhere we received an incredible amount</text>
  <text start="144.81" dur="3.929">of criticism because of it how dare you</text>
  <text start="146.579" dur="4.851">take the gospel to those who are in the</text>
  <text start="148.739" dur="8.641">new age or in the occult and I said</text>
  <text start="151.43" dur="7.24">where were you before you got saved you</text>
  <text start="157.38" dur="5.4">may not have been in the new age of the</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="5.76">occult but you were far from God and so</text>
  <text start="162.78" dur="3.209">this is the largest unreached people</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="5.22">group in America what do you mean don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="165.989" dur="7.581">go near them so the Lord began to take</text>
  <text start="169.65" dur="7.32">us into those incredible environments</text>
  <text start="173.57" dur="6.1">and he began to talk talk with us and</text>
  <text start="176.97" dur="6.389">teach us and we begin to talk with them</text>
  <text start="179.67" dur="6.21">and teach them we go into incredible</text>
  <text start="183.359" dur="3.811">places like Burning Man but last number</text>
  <text start="185.88" dur="3.419">of years have been a Burning Man that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="187.17" dur="5.7">where a week-long festival in the high</text>
  <text start="189.299" dur="7.261">desert of Nevada 52,000 tents will be</text>
  <text start="192.87" dur="6.51">set up in a semicircle around a 30-foot</text>
  <text start="196.56" dur="4.92">tall wooden structure that will burn at</text>
  <text start="199.38" dur="4.47">the end of the week they&amp;#39;ll set it on</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="4.349">fire this man this wooden man they build</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="5.41">they&amp;#39;ll set on fire and they&amp;#39;ll throw</text>
  <text start="205.829" dur="5.961">all their carries cares into the fire</text>
  <text start="209.26" dur="5.04">believing that that will burn up their</text>
  <text start="211.79" dur="12.449">past and start a whole new life for them</text>
  <text start="214.3" dur="11.769">they did the same thing every year we</text>
  <text start="224.239" dur="5.22">started to go in there over eight years</text>
  <text start="226.069" dur="5.101">ago we were you&amp;#39;re put into the</text>
  <text start="229.459" dur="5.161">semicircle in the order of your</text>
  <text start="231.17" dur="5.67">popularity or newness so if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="234.62" dur="4.11">the back row of this semicircle then</text>
  <text start="236.84" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re a brand new tent and if you&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="238.73" dur="6.45">the front row then you&amp;#39;re among the most</text>
  <text start="240.86" dur="5.61">popular tents we are on the head for the</text>
  <text start="245.18" dur="10.02">last three years have been on the front</text>
  <text start="246.47" dur="11.37">row among the top five out of 52,000 not</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="6.09">because we compromised the word but</text>
  <text start="257.84" dur="7.65">because we show them something they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="261.29" dur="5.849">never seen before we have lines of</text>
  <text start="265.49" dur="4.11">people that will line up outside of the</text>
  <text start="267.139" dur="4.711">tent that will wait anywhere from 45</text>
  <text start="269.6" dur="5.039">minutes to two hours just to get into</text>
  <text start="271.85" dur="6.71">the tent to pick from a menu board that</text>
  <text start="274.639" dur="3.921">we have called spirit cafe menu</text>
  <text start="282.389" dur="4.9">so we have dream interpretation pretty</text>
  <text start="285.639" dur="3.331">obvious we have spiritual readings which</text>
  <text start="287.289" dur="6.561">just prophesy spiritual cleansing which</text>
  <text start="288.97" dur="4.88">is deliverance and and so on and</text>
  <text start="293.94" dur="4.06">spiritual alignment and and all these</text>
  <text start="296.41" dur="3.84">things they have there&amp;#39;s Christian</text>
  <text start="298" dur="4.56">meanings behind it but we use</text>
  <text start="300.25" dur="5.94">terminology that will pique their</text>
  <text start="302.56" dur="5.94">interest we have people come to Jesus</text>
  <text start="306.19" dur="4.979">every year there and we have people come</text>
  <text start="308.5" dur="8.58">to Jesus after they leave there because</text>
  <text start="311.169" dur="10.111">the Holy Spirit won&amp;#39;t let them go we</text>
  <text start="317.08" dur="6.54">have teachers doctors attorneys judges</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="4.47">not only from the United States from</text>
  <text start="323.62" dur="4.59">multiple different countries that will</text>
  <text start="325.75" dur="3.93">come there we do the same thing in Salem</text>

  <text start="339.4" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;ve learned some things in the process</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="3.629">we&amp;#39;ve learned some things about how how</text>
  <text start="342.88" dur="3.75">things work we&amp;#39;ve gotten wiser we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="344.349" dur="5.19">gotten shrewder we we know how to how to</text>
  <text start="346.63" dur="5.19">work it better because we don&amp;#39;t again we</text>
  <text start="349.539" dur="5.16">don&amp;#39;t compromise but we talk about Jesus</text>
  <text start="351.82" dur="8.12">for example who is the true light of the</text>
  <text start="354.699" dur="8.521">world there is only one it&amp;#39;s not Krishna</text>

  <text start="511.479" dur="3.661">have to warn you before you ask for this</text>
  <text start="513.07" dur="5.94">pure light once you get this pure like</text>

  <text start="530.26" dur="5.72">yes of course okay</text>
  <text start="536.67" dur="11.14">eight out of ten who prayed that prayer</text>
  <text start="540.16" dur="11.13">will drop like a rock in two seconds and</text>
  <text start="547.81" dur="6.69">you watch their body move and contort</text>
  <text start="551.29" dur="6.32">and you see God moving and delivering</text>
  <text start="554.5" dur="3.11">them right there</text>
  <text start="558.03" dur="5.68">they&amp;#39;ll get up and out of those items</text>
  <text start="561.46" dur="5.46">out of those eight out of ten eight out</text>
  <text start="563.71" dur="12.09">of those ten will come up and say I just</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="13.29">met Jesus didn&amp;#39;t I now you see we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="575.8" dur="8.75">have to tell them who he is we tell them</text>
  <text start="580.21" dur="9.12">who he is without telling them who he is</text>
  <text start="584.55" dur="7.93">see it&amp;#39;s very important that we</text>
  <text start="589.33" dur="5.45">understand the power of God to prove</text>
  <text start="592.48" dur="2.3">himself</text>
  <text start="595.35" dur="5.74">we carry something inside of us that</text>
  <text start="598.12" dur="9.39">make him known to those who didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="601.09" dur="11.79">he existed like this we carry a</text>
  <text start="607.51" dur="8.97">spirituality that is so foreign yet so</text>
  <text start="612.88" dur="8.12">attractive but we don&amp;#39;t know how to</text>
  <text start="616.48" dur="4.52">present who we are to them</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="5.79">one of the first times here we did an</text>

  <text start="643.58" dur="4.59">mean it was really kind of strange we</text>
  <text start="645.23" dur="5.58">became like in one four-day period we</text>
  <text start="648.17" dur="6.09">became like the experts in it in things</text>
  <text start="650.81" dur="4.86">and and so God was touching and moving</text>
  <text start="654.26" dur="4.44">and at the end of it I went up to the</text>
