  <text start="61.71" dur="5.76">last six or seven lessons kind of set up</text>
  <text start="64.8" dur="3.959">some basic principles but now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="67.47" dur="3.81">getting into the meat of the course</text>
  <text start="68.759" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re getting into what we how the</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="4.65">rubber meets the road how do you</text>

  <text start="80.009" dur="5.431">know I hear a lot of people talk about</text>
  <text start="82.2" dur="5.19">faith faith healing I have faith you</text>
  <text start="85.44" dur="3.3">know faith in God and faith comes by</text>
  <text start="87.39" dur="5.339">hearing and hearing by the Word of God</text>
  <text start="88.74" dur="5.76">the problem is if you take Bible verses</text>
  <text start="92.729" dur="4.101">and say faith comes by hearing and</text>
  <text start="94.5" dur="5.179">hearing by the Word of God all these</text>
  <text start="96.83" dur="6.129">sound bites that we&amp;#39;ve been taught by</text>
  <text start="99.679" dur="5.17">church leaders during our lifetime okay</text>
  <text start="102.959" dur="4.8">if you&amp;#39;re going to explain to an atheist</text>
  <text start="104.849" dur="4.431">or an agnostic what does that mean how</text>
  <text start="107.759" dur="3.45">does that work out in practical</text>
  <text start="109.28" dur="3.94">application what does that actually look</text>
  <text start="111.209" dur="5.011">like most of us would not be able to</text>
  <text start="113.22" dur="5.22">explain to a non-believer what that</text>
  <text start="116.22" dur="4.17">actually looks like we just kind of have</text>
  <text start="118.44" dur="4.23">this thing that we say and we don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="120.39" dur="5.039">really know how to explain that to</text>
  <text start="122.67" dur="5.429">someone who hasn&amp;#39;t experienced the</text>
  <text start="125.429" dur="5.041">miraculous and doesn&amp;#39;t really know what</text>
  <text start="128.099" dur="4.651">faith looks like so faith has become</text>
  <text start="130.47" dur="4.53">kind of a nebulous term a lot of people</text>
  <text start="132.75" dur="6.03">don&amp;#39;t actually define what they mean</text>
  <text start="135" dur="7.02">when they talk about faith so today I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="6">going to give you as clear a description</text>
  <text start="142.02" dur="4.53">of faith and give you some illustrations</text>
  <text start="144.78" dur="3.84">to show you what faith actually looks</text>
  <text start="146.55" dur="3.08">like there are two different roads you</text>
  <text start="148.62" dur="3.47">can go down in</text>
  <text start="149.63" dur="6.09">in healing there is medicine and there</text>
  <text start="152.09" dur="6.48">is the miraculous in medicine it is all</text>
  <text start="155.72" dur="4.86">about what you know and how skilled you</text>
  <text start="158.57" dur="4.26">are if you are a skilled surgeon if</text>
  <text start="160.58" dur="4.2">you&amp;#39;re a skilled doctor you go to school</text>
  <text start="162.83" dur="3.89">and you learn a lot you&amp;#39;ll have a</text>
  <text start="164.78" dur="4.68">successful practice as a medical doctor</text>
  <text start="166.72" dur="5.35">it&amp;#39;s all about what you know and how</text>
  <text start="169.46" dur="5.34">skilled you are in faith healing and</text>
  <text start="172.07" dur="6.24">miracles it is all about who you know</text>
  <text start="174.8" dur="8.16">and what you believe Jesus gave His</text>
  <text start="178.31" dur="7.92">disciples power and authority to heal</text>
  <text start="182.96" dur="6.57">the sick raise the dead cleanse the</text>
  <text start="186.23" dur="5.79">lepers cast out demons they healed sick</text>
  <text start="189.53" dur="4.89">people by the thousands they restored</text>
  <text start="192.02" dur="5.37">sight to the blind they cleanse lepers</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="7.23">they did all this work now I want to</text>
  <text start="197.39" dur="7.02">start out with an example of healing</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="4.74">which is actually deliverance and this</text>
  <text start="204.41" dur="6.45">is from Matthew 17 I&amp;#39;m gonna read it to</text>
  <text start="206.39" dur="7.41">you Matthew 17 14 through 20 and when</text>
  <text start="210.86" dur="5.31">they the disciples in Jesus they were</text>
  <text start="213.8" dur="4.47">walking they&amp;#39;d come to the multitude a</text>
  <text start="216.17" dur="4.95">man came to him kneeling down to him and</text>
  <text start="218.27" dur="5.04">saying lord have mercy on me and my son</text>
  <text start="221.12" dur="5.16">for he is an epileptic he has seizures</text>
  <text start="223.31" dur="4.86">and he suffers severely for he often</text>
  <text start="226.28" dur="3.9">falls into the fire and into the water</text>
  <text start="228.17" dur="4.86">so I brought him to your disciples but</text>
  <text start="230.18" dur="4.98">they could not cure him then jesus</text>
  <text start="233.03" dur="4.98">answered and said o faithless and</text>
  <text start="235.16" dur="4.86">perverse generation how long shall I be</text>
  <text start="238.01" dur="5.16">with you how long shall I bear with you</text>
  <text start="240.02" dur="6.39">bring him here to me then Jesus rebuked</text>
  <text start="243.17" dur="5.88">the demon and it came out of him and the</text>
  <text start="246.41" dur="4.65">child was cured from that very hour then</text>
  <text start="249.05" dur="5.04">the disciples came to Jesus privately</text>
  <text start="251.06" dur="6.17">and said Lord why could we not cast it</text>
  <text start="254.09" dur="5.42">out now I want us to take a pause here</text>
  <text start="257.23" dur="5.44">Jesus had been teaching them about</text>
  <text start="259.51" dur="6.58">healing and deliverance and miracles and</text>
  <text start="262.67" dur="4.89">this is Matthew 17 this is well into the</text>
  <text start="266.09" dur="2.97">Ministry of Jesus and a disciples they</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="3.57">had seen a lot of people healed by now</text>
  <text start="269.06" dur="3.93">but they couldn&amp;#39;t get this kid healed</text>
  <text start="271.13" dur="4.74">they couldn&amp;#39;t hear this demon so they</text>
  <text start="272.99" dur="4.29">asked him why could we heal others but</text>
  <text start="275.87" dur="5.43">we couldn&amp;#39;t get this kid healed and</text>
  <text start="277.28" dur="6.12">Jesus said because of your unbelief for</text>
  <text start="281.3" dur="4.589">assuredly I say to you if you have</text>
  <text start="283.4" dur="5.04">faith as a mustard seed you&amp;#39;ll say to</text>
  <text start="285.889" dur="4.56">this mountain move from here to there</text>
  <text start="288.44" dur="5.599">and not and it will move and nothing</text>
  <text start="290.449" dur="7.921">will be impossible for you a really good</text>
  <text start="294.039" dur="7.121">example of how faith works for healing</text>
  <text start="298.37" dur="5.1">deliverance and miracles and there is a</text>
  <text start="301.16" dur="4.92">difference between healing deliverance</text>
  <text start="303.47" dur="5.31">and miracles and in the next couple of</text>
  <text start="306.08" dur="4.38">weeks we&amp;#39;ll dive into that we&amp;#39;ll do an</text>
  <text start="308.78" dur="4.74">in-depth examination of the difference</text>
  <text start="310.46" dur="6.44">between all of them but for this week</text>
  <text start="313.52" dur="6.36">what Jesus told them was they could not</text>
  <text start="316.9" dur="5.23">cure this kid&amp;#39;s epilepsy his seizures</text>
  <text start="319.88" dur="5.159">because he had a demon and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="322.13" dur="4.65">have faith enough to exercise the</text>
  <text start="325.039" dur="5.311">authority necessary to make that demon</text>
  <text start="326.78" dur="7.199">go they were full of unbelief okay so</text>
  <text start="330.35" dur="6.78">I&amp;#39;m going to get rid of one sacred cow</text>
  <text start="333.979" dur="5.431">right now and and this is something I</text>
  <text start="337.13" dur="5.219">hear virtually every day in the</text>
  <text start="339.41" dur="5.55">Christian community people say I have</text>
  <text start="342.349" dur="4.471">faith as small as a mustard seed I can</text>
  <text start="344.96" dur="3.45">do miracles I&amp;#39;m gonna believe that God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="346.82" dur="2.43">gonna do this I have faith as small as a</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="4.5">mustard seed</text>
  <text start="349.25" dur="6.15">III feel bad for people who have never</text>
  <text start="352.91" dur="5.64">been taught what mustard seed faith is</text>
  <text start="355.4" dur="5.25">all about when Jesus said if you have</text>
  <text start="358.55" dur="4.799">faith as a mustard seed you can say to</text>
  <text start="360.65" dur="4.98">this mountain move and it&amp;#39;ll go so</text>
  <text start="363.349" dur="5.281">people say all I need is faith as small</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="5.819">as a mustard seed but that is not what</text>
  <text start="368.63" dur="4.469">Jesus said it&amp;#39;s not what he said he</text>
  <text start="371.449" dur="6.09">didn&amp;#39;t say you need faith as small as a</text>
  <text start="373.099" dur="9.391">mustard seed he said you need faith as a</text>
  <text start="377.539" dur="8.011">mustard seed as faith that acts the way</text>
  <text start="382.49" dur="6.27">a mustard seed acts not faith as small</text>
  <text start="385.55" dur="6.03">as a mustard seed because a verse</text>
  <text start="388.76" dur="5.61">earlier he just rebuked disciples</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="5.339">because they had small little tiny faith</text>
  <text start="394.37" dur="4.59">so he wasn&amp;#39;t talking about small little</text>
  <text start="396.919" dur="4.56">tiny faith this is faith as small as a</text>
  <text start="398.96" dur="5.76">mustard seed he was talking about faith</text>
  <text start="401.479" dur="5.611">that acts the way a mustard seed acts so</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="4.259">if you want to know what mustard seed</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="4.139">faith is you have to go to the parable</text>
  <text start="408.979" dur="5.55">of the mustard seed where Jesus explains</text>
  <text start="411.229" dur="5.43">what a mustard seed does if you go to</text>
  <text start="414.529" dur="2.711">the kingdom parables and read about the</text>
  <text start="416.659" dur="3.491">parable</text>
  <text start="417.24" dur="5.88">mustardseed what did Jesus teach he said</text>
  <text start="420.15" dur="5.82">the kingdom of God is likened to a</text>
  <text start="423.12" dur="6.6">mustard seed which although it is a</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="5.729">smallest of seeds it grows into a great</text>
  <text start="429.72" dur="4.379">tree so large at the birds of the air</text>
  <text start="431.699" dur="6.361">come to nest in it so what does a</text>
  <text start="434.099" dur="9.301">mustard seed do starts out small but it</text>
  <text start="438.06" dur="8.4">grows so the key to mustard seed faith</text>
  <text start="443.4" dur="6.93">is although your faith starts out small</text>
  <text start="446.46" dur="7.32">it has to grow you will start with small</text>
  <text start="450.33" dur="5.519">little faith but as you progress your</text>
  <text start="453.78" dur="3.81">walk further into the kingdom as you get</text>
  <text start="455.849" dur="4.611">to know God more as you get to</text>
  <text start="457.59" dur="6.329">understand his ways your faith grows</text>
  <text start="460.46" dur="5.56">that&amp;#39;s the key to faith that does</text>
  <text start="463.919" dur="4.891">miracles and healing it&amp;#39;s not small</text>
  <text start="466.02" dur="6.989">faith it&amp;#39;s faith that grows and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="468.81" dur="8.22">an example when the Roman centurion came</text>
  <text start="473.009" dur="7.291">to Jesus and said Lord my servant is</text>
  <text start="477.03" dur="5.34">sick can you heal him Jesus said yes in</text>
  <text start="480.3" dur="4.38">the certain the Roman centurion said I</text>
  <text start="482.37" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t need you to come to my house I&amp;#39;m a</text>
  <text start="484.68" dur="4.35">man under Authority I know how authority</text>
  <text start="486.78" dur="4.259">works I say to this man come and he</text>
  <text start="489.03" dur="5.25">comes I say to that man go and he goes</text>
  <text start="491.039" dur="6.031">all you need to do is say a word and my</text>
  <text start="494.28" dur="6.99">servant will be healed jesus said to the</text>
  <text start="497.07" dur="8.3">crowd I have not seen such great faith</text>
  <text start="501.27" dur="7.709">even in all of Israel this was a Gentile</text>
  <text start="505.37" dur="6.64">Roman centurion who understood what</text>
  <text start="508.979" dur="5.31">faith and authority look like he</text>
  <text start="512.01" dur="5.13">commended the Roman centurion for having</text>
  <text start="514.289" dur="6.81">great faith he rebuked the disciples</text>
  <text start="517.14" dur="5.519">when they had unbelief okay so first</text>
  <text start="521.099" dur="3.571">thing you need to understand is having</text>
  <text start="522.659" dur="4.471">small faith is not what it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="524.67" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s about having great faith and when</text>
  <text start="527.13" dur="4.86">to shift gears here real quick and I</text>
  <text start="528.75" dur="5.31">want to go to the story of the woman</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="4.38">with the flow of blood who was healed</text>
  <text start="534.06" dur="4.14">now Jesus was walking with the disciples</text>
  <text start="536.37" dur="4.65">and there was a crowd that gathered</text>
  <text start="538.2" dur="5.129">around them and a woman snuck up behind</text>
  <text start="541.02" dur="4.319">them and she thought to herself</text>
  <text start="543.329" dur="5.13">if only I touched the hem of His garment</text>
  <text start="545.339" dur="5.191">I will be healed she reached out she</text>
  <text start="548.459" dur="4.681">grabbed on to his garment</text>
  <text start="550.53" dur="5.25">the Bible says power went out of him and</text>
  <text start="553.14" dur="3.9">she was healed from that moment then</text>
  <text start="555.78" dur="3.33">Jesus turned around and asked the</text>
  <text start="557.04" dur="3.15">disciples who touched me and the</text>
  <text start="559.11" dur="2.76">disciples were like what do you mean</text>
  <text start="560.19" dur="3.15">Lord who touched you that there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="561.87" dur="2.73">crowd of people there thronging</text>
  <text start="563.34" dur="2.79">everyone&amp;#39;s touching you what are you</text>
  <text start="564.6" dur="3.87">talking about and he said someone</text>
  <text start="566.13" dur="5.67">touched me I felt power go out of me</text>
  <text start="568.47" dur="6.39">so he interrogated the crowd and the</text>
  <text start="571.8" dur="6.21">woman then testified and she said I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="574.86" dur="5.34">had a flow of blood and have mercy on me</text>
  <text start="578.01" dur="4.23">I just needed to be healed and I felt</text>
  <text start="580.2" dur="5.97">that if I touched you I would be healed</text>
  <text start="582.24" dur="8.22">and Jesus said a woman your faith has</text>
  <text start="586.17" dur="7.79">healed you now this is an example where</text>
  <text start="590.46" dur="6.15">the faith of the person who was sick</text>
  <text start="593.96" dur="4.02">apprehended their own healing in the</text>
  <text start="596.61" dur="4.02">majority of cases in the New Testament</text>
  <text start="597.98" dur="5.05">where people are healed or set free of</text>
  <text start="600.63" dur="4.02">demons it is the faith of the person who</text>
  <text start="603.03" dur="3.89">is praying it is a faith of the</text>
  <text start="604.65" dur="4.44">disciples or the faith of Jesus that</text>
  <text start="606.92" dur="4.81">appropriates the healing but in this</text>
  <text start="609.09" dur="5.7">case this is a rare case the woman who</text>
  <text start="611.73" dur="5.55">needed the healing her faith drew the</text>
  <text start="614.79" dur="4.95">power out of Jesus and healed her now</text>
  <text start="617.28" dur="4.56">unfortunately there are some people in</text>
  <text start="619.74" dur="4.2">modern churches especially in the Word</text>
  <text start="621.84" dur="5.7">of Faith Movement where people have</text>
  <text start="623.94" dur="5.76">mistakenly got the idea that as the</text>
  <text start="627.54" dur="3.84">person who needs to be healed it&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="629.7" dur="3.3">you to have faith and if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="631.38" dur="3.93">healed it&amp;#39;s because you don&amp;#39;t have faith</text>
  <text start="633" dur="4.08">just because you don&amp;#39;t have enough faith</text>
  <text start="635.31" dur="4.5">to be healed it&amp;#39;s because of your</text>
  <text start="637.08" dur="4.65">unbelief that is absolutely a lie that</text>
  <text start="639.81" dur="5.07">is absolutely not true</text>
  <text start="641.73" dur="6">you do not need to have faith to be</text>
  <text start="644.88" dur="5.01">healed that type of healing where the</text>
  <text start="647.73" dur="3.87">sick person was the one who needed to</text>
  <text start="649.89" dur="3.84">have faith healing is very rare there</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="4.2">are only a few examples of that in the</text>
  <text start="653.73" dur="5.55">New Testament again going back to the</text>
  <text start="655.8" dur="6.03">Matthew 17 example Jesus rebuked the</text>
  <text start="659.28" dur="5.25">disciples because they did not have</text>
  <text start="661.83" dur="4.2">faith to get this child healed and most</text>
  <text start="664.53" dur="3.51">of the time when we are praying for</text>
  <text start="666.03" dur="4.92">someone to be healed it&amp;#39;s our faith that</text>
  <text start="668.04" dur="4.2">is on the line our faith or our unbelief</text>
  <text start="670.95" dur="3.54">is going to determine whether they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="672.24" dur="5.58">healed or not it&amp;#39;s not their faith it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="674.49" dur="5.76">our faith most of the time I have seen</text>
  <text start="677.82" dur="5.46">some people healed who had great faith</text>
  <text start="680.25" dur="3.9">who had expectancy and their faith made</text>
  <text start="683.28" dur="3.63">a draw</text>
  <text start="684.15" dur="4.71">on the power that lives inside of me and</text>
  <text start="686.91" dur="4.8">they got healed just by being around me</text>
  <text start="688.86" dur="4.44">the power just left and boom they got</text>
  <text start="691.71" dur="4.67">healed I have seen that happen it</text>
  <text start="693.3" dur="5.58">doesn&amp;#39;t happen very often in the crowd</text>
  <text start="696.38" dur="5.83">while this woman who had the flow of</text>

  <text start="713.91" dur="6.27">good example of how power and faith work</text>
  <text start="717.54" dur="5.85">we&amp;#39;ll cover that in later of discussions</text>

  <text start="813.959" dur="3.98">healed let&amp;#39;s talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="816.089" dur="4.77">what kind of faith this is</text>
  <text start="817.939" dur="5.62">some people would say that we need to</text>
  <text start="820.859" dur="5.491">have faith that Jesus is the Messiah</text>
  <text start="823.559" dur="4.351">well that is an important aspect of</text>
  <text start="826.35" dur="3.539">faith but that&amp;#39;s not the kind of faith</text>
  <text start="827.91" dur="5.31">that heals people or raises them from</text>
  <text start="829.889" dur="5.3">the dead Jesus undoubtedly wanted je</text>
  <text start="833.22" dur="4.619">iris to believe that he was the Messiah</text>
  <text start="835.189" dur="3.82">look now I think everyone should believe</text>
  <text start="837.839" dur="3.75">that Jesus is a messiah</text>
  <text start="839.009" dur="4.471">you know that&amp;#39;s faith that saves us from</text>
  <text start="841.589" dur="6.96">the consequences of sin but that is not</text>
  <text start="843.48" dur="7.199">faith that heals the sick okay faith</text>
  <text start="848.549" dur="7.741">that heals the sick and raise the dead</text>
  <text start="850.679" dur="10.53">is specific to the event that you are</text>
  <text start="856.29" dur="8.399">looking at so what happened here Jesus</text>
  <text start="861.209" dur="6.511">told Jairus and this is my paraphrase</text>
  <text start="864.689" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s not about you believing that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="867.72" dur="6.029">the Messiah it&amp;#39;s not about you believing</text>
  <text start="870.029" dur="6.09">in God it is about you believing that</text>
  <text start="873.749" dur="4.53">when we go down to your house and I</text>
  <text start="876.119" dur="4.981">touch her she is going to be raised from</text>
  <text start="878.279" dur="6.09">the dead Jesus wanted Jairus to believe</text>
  <text start="881.1" dur="5.639">a specific set of circumstances would</text>
  <text start="884.369" dur="4.26">result if they went through with this</text>
  <text start="886.739" dur="4.89">and tried to get her daughter&amp;#39;s daughter</text>
  <text start="888.629" dur="5.88">resurrected faith for healing and</text>
  <text start="891.629" dur="6.33">miracles is specific to the person and</text>
  <text start="894.509" dur="5.341">the illness and the SIRT the immediate</text>
  <text start="897.959" dur="3.93">circumstances right now that is what</text>
  <text start="899.85" dur="4.079">faith for healing is all about it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="901.889" dur="3.57">a general faith it&amp;#39;s not I believe in</text>
  <text start="903.929" dur="4.56">God it&amp;#39;s not I believe that Jesus is</text>
  <text start="905.459" dur="4.891">Messiah it is believing specific things</text>
  <text start="908.489" dur="3.45">about the person who needs to be healed</text>
  <text start="910.35" dur="5.12">raised from the dead or set free of the</text>
  <text start="911.939" dur="6.69">demon that is faith for the miraculous</text>
  <text start="915.47" dur="3.789">now when I started praying for people to</text>
  <text start="918.629" dur="3.66">be healed</text>
  <text start="919.259" dur="4.711">I started out begging God to heal people</text>
  <text start="922.289" dur="4.17">if you don&amp;#39;t know anything about healing</text>
  <text start="923.97" dur="4.799">ER or miracles or raising the dead you</text>
  <text start="926.459" dur="5.22">just assume hey I&amp;#39;m just gonna ask God</text>
  <text start="928.769" dur="7.02">and gods either gonna heal them or he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="931.679" dur="5.91">not because maybe it&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s will to</text>
  <text start="935.789" dur="3.21">heal this person or maybe it&amp;#39;s not his</text>
  <text start="937.589" dur="2.79">will we know I don&amp;#39;t know what God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="938.999" dur="3.181">mind is I don&amp;#39;t know if God wants to</text>
  <text start="940.379" dur="5.731">heal this person</text>
  <text start="942.18" dur="6.63">so most of us when we pray we ask God to</text>
  <text start="946.11" dur="4.29">heal somebody we ask God to raise him</text>
  <text start="948.81" dur="3.27">from the dead we ask God to set them</text>
  <text start="950.4" dur="5.07">free of demons or addiction or whatever</text>
  <text start="952.08" dur="4.71">and I did that for about two or three</text>
  <text start="955.47" dur="4.86">months and I didn&amp;#39;t see one person</text>
  <text start="956.79" dur="6.09">healed not one no one was healed as long</text>
  <text start="960.33" dur="3.96">as I was begging God for healing so I</text>
  <text start="962.88" dur="3.39">started going through the New Testament</text>
  <text start="964.29" dur="3.27">and I looked at the disciples and Jesus</text>
  <text start="966.27" dur="3.45">and I was like you know they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="967.56" dur="3.93">asking the Father to heal people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="969.72" dur="4.86">not like Jesus prayed to the Father</text>
  <text start="971.49" dur="6.45">father would you heal this poor demon</text>
  <text start="974.58" dur="5.37">afflicted person no Jesus would command</text>
  <text start="977.94" dur="4.68">the demon to leave he would release</text>
  <text start="979.95" dur="5.25">power with a touch or he would put mud</text>
  <text start="982.62" dur="5.04">in the eye of a blind person and that</text>
  <text start="985.2" dur="5.22">would release power or he would exercise</text>
  <text start="987.66" dur="5.46">authority kick out a demon he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="990.42" dur="4.62">begging the father to do anything and I</text>
  <text start="993.12" dur="3.21">started watching videos people like Todd</text>
  <text start="995.04" dur="4.11">white and I noticed that Todd white</text>
  <text start="996.33" dur="4.59">would command bones to be healed he</text>
  <text start="999.15" dur="3.57">would command ligaments to heal he would</text>
  <text start="1000.92" dur="3.66">command tendons to be healed he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1002.72" dur="4.14">begging God to do anything he was</text>
  <text start="1004.58" dur="4.62">commanding things to be healed he was</text>
  <text start="1006.86" dur="5.13">releasing power he was commanding demons</text>
  <text start="1009.2" dur="6.15">evil spirits to leave and he had really</text>
  <text start="1011.99" dur="4.95">good success and that kind of blew my</text>
  <text start="1015.35" dur="4.77">mind I was like wait a minute</text>
  <text start="1016.94" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s cheating you can you do that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1020.12" dur="6.39">not asking God to do this stuff one</text>
  <text start="1022.49" dur="7.11">thing that you might consider is if you</text>
  <text start="1026.51" dur="5.13">are begging God to heal somebody you are</text>
  <text start="1029.6" dur="4.37">actually believing that you are more</text>
  <text start="1031.64" dur="4.8">merciful and compassionate than God is</text>
  <text start="1033.97" dur="4.869">because you&amp;#39;re assuming well God doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1036.44" dur="5.64">want this person healed so I have to beg</text>
  <text start="1038.839" dur="5.161">and plead and with God and hopefully</text>
  <text start="1042.08" dur="3.66">convince God that this person is worthy</text>
  <text start="1044" dur="3">of being healed well I have got some</text>
  <text start="1045.74" dur="3.36">news for you you&amp;#39;re not more</text>
  <text start="1047" dur="5.37">compassionate than God is you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1049.1" dur="8.12">more merciful God wants us healed more</text>
  <text start="1052.37" dur="7.39">than we want them healed the key is</text>
  <text start="1057.22" dur="4.579">developing faith</text>
  <text start="1059.76" dur="3.9">so that we can release the power and so</text>
  <text start="1061.799" dur="4.311">that we can exercise our authority</text>
  <text start="1063.66" dur="5.34">properly and get these people healed I</text>
  <text start="1066.11" dur="4.9">struggle with doubt and unbelief when I</text>
  <text start="1069" dur="5.07">started trying to get people healed I</text>
  <text start="1071.01" dur="4.289">was full of doubt I when I say doubt and</text>
  <text start="1074.07" dur="4.8">unbelief this is what I&amp;#39;m talking about</text>
  <text start="1075.299" dur="5.581">I did not believe these people were</text>
  <text start="1078.87" dur="4.92">actually gonna be healed I was praying</text>
  <text start="1080.88" dur="4.77">for them because God told me in this</text>
  <text start="1083.79" dur="4.17">dream he said I want you to pray for</text>
  <text start="1085.65" dur="4.56">your patients and I&amp;#39;m gonna heal them so</text>
  <text start="1087.96" dur="4.83">I was praying because God told me to and</text>
  <text start="1090.21" dur="4.41">I was begging God but I didn&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="1092.79" dur="3.78">any of them to be healed when I would</text>
  <text start="1094.62" dur="4.71">lay hands on somebody and I would say Oh</text>
  <text start="1096.57" dur="5.099">Lord you know please heal this person</text>
  <text start="1099.33" dur="3.51">and Lord do this and God would you</text>
  <text start="1101.669" dur="3.421">please heal that person</text>
  <text start="1102.84" dur="5.28">I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting them to be healed I</text>
  <text start="1105.09" dur="5.13">did not have expectation I did not have</text>
  <text start="1108.12" dur="4.439">confidence that they were going to</text>
  <text start="1110.22" dur="4.32">actually be healed I had a lot of doubts</text>
  <text start="1112.559" dur="3.36">and a lot of skepticism I just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1114.54" dur="2.7">think they were gonna be healed I was</text>
  <text start="1115.919" dur="3.541">doing it because I knew it was the right</text>
  <text start="1117.24" dur="5.04">thing to do but I wasn&amp;#39;t doing it</text>
  <text start="1119.46" dur="7.91">expecting them to actually be healed and</text>
  <text start="1122.28" dur="7.26">see faith has a component of expectation</text>
  <text start="1127.37" dur="6.22">faith is the substance of things hoped</text>
  <text start="1129.54" dur="6.84">for the evidence of things not seen my</text>
  <text start="1133.59" dur="6.51">translation of that verse from Hebrews</text>
  <text start="1136.38" dur="7.2">is faith is the confident expectation of</text>
  <text start="1140.1" dur="5.069">the things that we want to happen there</text>
  <text start="1143.58" dur="5.219">is an element of confidence and</text>
  <text start="1145.169" dur="6.241">expectation in faith that a lot of</text>
  <text start="1148.799" dur="4.891">people don&amp;#39;t consider faith is trust</text>
  <text start="1151.41" dur="4.649">it&amp;#39;s trusting that God actually wants</text>
  <text start="1153.69" dur="4.619">this person healed it is trusting and</text>
  <text start="1156.059" dur="3.691">believing that when you lay hands in</text>
  <text start="1158.309" dur="3.901">them and when you release power they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1159.75" dur="5.01">actually going to be healed that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="1162.21" dur="4.98">faith is faith is confidence now when I</text>
  <text start="1164.76" dur="4.89">was starting out praying for people to</text>
  <text start="1167.19" dur="4.5">be healed I finally started to see a few</text>
  <text start="1169.65" dur="2.82">people healed I saw a woman healed with</text>
  <text start="1171.69" dur="4.35">migraine headaches</text>
  <text start="1172.47" dur="5.66">I saw a few elderly women healed of one</text>
  <text start="1176.04" dur="5.55">lady had a broken foot another lady had</text>
  <text start="1178.13" dur="5.32">scoliosis and a torn meniscus started to</text>
  <text start="1181.59" dur="3.329">see some people healed going to the</text>
  <text start="1183.45" dur="2.76">grocery stores and I would pray for</text>
  <text start="1184.919" dur="4.441">people who had slings</text>
  <text start="1186.21" dur="4.86">on their shoulders and some I saw a lot</text>

  <text start="1201.98" dur="6.66">small but as I began to see people</text>
  <text start="1205.309" dur="5.791">healed my unbelief my doubt started to</text>
  <text start="1208.64" dur="5.01">decrease I started to have a little more</text>
  <text start="1211.1" dur="5.699">expectation and I saw a couple more</text>

  <text start="1229.58" dur="4.2">to see a lot of them healed in fact I</text>
  <text start="1231.62" dur="4.2">got to a point where I think I saw 10 or</text>

  <text start="1395.76" dur="6.9">significant to me it revealed to me that</text>
  <text start="1399.059" dur="5.821">my faith had grown from the point where</text>
  <text start="1402.66" dur="5.1">I started full of unbelief and doubt and</text>
  <text start="1404.88" dur="4.71">skepticism to a point where I was seeing</text>
  <text start="1407.76" dur="4.02">people healed pretty regularly probably</text>
  <text start="1409.59" dur="5.61">about 80 percent with some conditions</text>
  <text start="1411.78" dur="6.42">like shoulders and carpal tunnel it was</text>
  <text start="1415.2" dur="6.15">around 90 or 95 percent what he was</text>
  <text start="1418.2" dur="6.84">telling me was my faith had the</text>
  <text start="1421.35" dur="6.72">potential to heal the entire city if I</text>
  <text start="1425.04" dur="5.4">decided to use it that way I I had</text>

  <text start="1430.44" dur="5.88">faith was the kind of faith that heals</text>
  <text start="1433.11" dur="5.449">people consistently and any one of us</text>
  <text start="1436.32" dur="5.43">you can have that same kind of faith</text>
  <text start="1438.559" dur="4.811">your faith if it is small if you have</text>
  <text start="1441.75" dur="4.17">some doubt if you have some belief right</text>
  <text start="1443.37" dur="4.35">now in a year or two if you consistently</text>

  <text start="1447.72" dur="6">you will eventually watch your faith</text>
  <text start="1450.21" dur="6.09">grow into faith that has a potential to</text>
  <text start="1453.72" dur="5.22">heal your entire city that is what God</text>
  <text start="1456.3" dur="5.61">desires that is his will</text>
  <text start="1458.94" dur="5.01">his will for us is that we would become</text>

  <text start="1624.24" dur="5.91">that was probably three years ago all</text>
  <text start="1626.79" dur="5.61">right so what happened there was I at</text>
  <text start="1630.15" dur="4.41">that point I didn&amp;#39;t have a lot of faith</text>
  <text start="1632.4" dur="5.82">for healing electronic devices I had</text>
  <text start="1634.56" dur="6.75">kind of unbelief and some skepticism but</text>
  <text start="1638.22" dur="4.92">I watched her she had a big confident</text>
  <text start="1641.31" dur="3.48">smile on her face she had expectations</text>
  <text start="1643.14" dur="3.24">she&amp;#39;s like no we&amp;#39;re gonna heal this</text>
  <text start="1644.79" dur="3.87">thing this is thing is totally gonna get</text>

  <text start="1652.44" dur="6.81">faith it gave me some confidence now</text>
  <text start="1655.2" dur="4.98">about four months later we had a car</text>
  <text start="1659.25" dur="2.58">that wanted to sell</text>
  <text start="1660.18" dur="3.3">we bought this car for my daughter when</text>
  <text start="1661.83" dur="3.3">she was going to college she had</text>
  <text start="1663.48" dur="3.9">finished college moved out of state we</text>
  <text start="1665.13" dur="4.38">had this car sitting around and we</text>
  <text start="1667.38" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t need it so we needed to sell it</text>
  <text start="1669.51" dur="5.7">we&amp;#39;re gonna list it on Craigslist the</text>
  <text start="1671.34" dur="6.75">problem was a car ran terrible it had a</text>
  <text start="1675.21" dur="4.05">bad hesitation and sputtering whenever</text>
  <text start="1678.09" dur="3.96">you would slow down to come to an</text>
  <text start="1679.26" dur="4.59">intersection when you accelerate coming</text>
  <text start="1682.05" dur="5.55">out of the intersection hesitation and</text>
  <text start="1683.85" dur="6.42">sputtering every single time and I</text>
  <text start="1687.6" dur="4.2">thought well before we sell this car I</text>
  <text start="1690.27" dur="3.57">should get it running good so that we</text>
  <text start="1691.8" dur="4.2">can at least get out of it what we had</text>
  <text start="1693.84" dur="4.41">paid for it and if it wasn&amp;#39;t running</text>
  <text start="1696" dur="4.71">good we wouldn&amp;#39;t get as much money so I</text>
  <text start="1698.25" dur="3.3">went up to the garage and I was gonna</text>
  <text start="1700.71" dur="4.71">get some tools</text>
  <text start="1701.55" dur="5.67">do it tune-up replaced the plugs and the</text>
  <text start="1705.42" dur="4.53">spark plugs and the wires and just do</text>
  <text start="1707.22" dur="5.64">kind of basic tune-up on it and as I go</text>
  <text start="1709.95" dur="5.94">out in the garage I hear in my mind the</text>
  <text start="1712.86" dur="8.07">Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s a didn&amp;#39;t I fix the iPod</text>
  <text start="1715.89" dur="6.49">dock and I stopped and I said yes Lord</text>
  <text start="1720.93" dur="3.85">you did</text>
  <text start="1722.38" dur="6.33">and he said why don&amp;#39;t you believe that I</text>
  <text start="1724.78" dur="5.96">can fix the car so I was like okay I</text>
  <text start="1728.71" dur="7.05">guess we&amp;#39;re gonna have another miracle</text>
