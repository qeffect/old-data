  <text start="90.979" dur="4.441">today I wanted to talk to you a little</text>
  <text start="93.649" dur="4.14">bit today about something that&amp;#39;s been on</text>
  <text start="95.42" dur="4.32">my mind it&amp;#39;s been on the mind of a few</text>
  <text start="97.789" dur="4.44">of my friends too I got a couple of</text>
  <text start="99.74" dur="5.4">email messages this week from friends</text>
  <text start="102.229" dur="5.791">asking the question is emotional healing</text>
  <text start="105.14" dur="4.38">really necessary to some of you the</text>
  <text start="108.02" dur="3.299">answer to this question might seem</text>
  <text start="109.52" dur="4.739">obvious you might say of course</text>
  <text start="111.319" dur="5.461">emotional healing is necessary but that</text>
  <text start="114.259" dur="4.56">view is not universally held in the</text>
  <text start="116.78" dur="3.96">healing community there are a couple of</text>
  <text start="118.819" dur="3.901">different schools of thought on the</text>
  <text start="120.74" dur="5.64">subject of emotional healing deliverance</text>
  <text start="122.72" dur="6.179">and working with generational issues one</text>
  <text start="126.38" dur="6">school of thought believes that all of</text>
  <text start="128.899" dur="5.491">this type of prayer is necessary and</text>
  <text start="132.38" dur="3.96">beneficial there is another school of</text>
  <text start="134.39" dur="4.709">thought that says most of this is</text>
  <text start="136.34" dur="6.18">absolutely unnecessary I want to focus a</text>
  <text start="139.099" dur="5.61">little bit on the view that says most of</text>
  <text start="142.52" dur="4.11">this is unnecessary I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="144.709" dur="4.471">name names but there are a number of</text>
  <text start="146.63" dur="3.619">prominent ministries today that teach</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="3.919">that</text>
  <text start="150.249" dur="4.71">working with generational curses working</text>
  <text start="153.099" dur="4.59">with bloodlines and things like</text>
  <text start="154.959" dur="6.691">emotional healing are unnecessary and</text>
  <text start="157.689" dur="6.36">that these things actually discredit the</text>
  <text start="161.65" dur="4.08">work that Jesus did in the cross and and</text>
  <text start="164.049" dur="4.17">here&amp;#39;s where it comes from for many</text>
  <text start="165.73" dur="5.31">years particularly in the coastal and</text>
  <text start="168.219" dur="5.61">charismatic churches people have gone</text>
  <text start="171.04" dur="7.05">through some very uncomfortable some</text>
  <text start="173.829" dur="6.541">very bizarre practices in trying to get</text>
  <text start="178.09" dur="4.319">healed get free of demons a lot of that</text>
  <text start="180.37" dur="4.11">has come down to what it looks like a</text>
  <text start="182.409" dur="4.23">lot of jumping through hoops I have met</text>
  <text start="184.48" dur="3.869">people who have so many messages and</text>
  <text start="186.639" dur="3.451">said you know I&amp;#39;ve been through</text>
  <text start="188.349" dur="3.36">emotional healing I&amp;#39;ve been through so</text>
  <text start="190.09" dur="3.39">though I&amp;#39;ve been through deliverance I</text>
  <text start="191.709" dur="4.051">have repented of everything I can think</text>
  <text start="193.48" dur="4.439">of I have renounced everything I can</text>
  <text start="195.76" dur="4.309">think of I have forgiven everyone I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="197.919" dur="5.311">ever known and I&amp;#39;m still not healed and</text>
  <text start="200.069" dur="4.991">some people will take this type of</text>
  <text start="203.23" dur="3.719">situation and say you see what these</text>
  <text start="205.06" dur="3.45">people are doing is they&amp;#39;re having to</text>
  <text start="206.949" dur="3.21">jump through all these hoops trying to</text>
  <text start="208.51" dur="3.569">do all the right things to try to pray</text>
  <text start="210.159" dur="4.47">all the right prayers in order to obtain</text>
  <text start="212.079" dur="6.451">some kind of healing that eludes them</text>
  <text start="214.629" dur="6.151">and what they would say is all we need</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="4.769">to do is renew our mind to the truth</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="6.03">renew our mind to what Jesus did on the</text>
  <text start="223.299" dur="7.02">cross to apprehend the fullness of life</text>
  <text start="226.81" dur="7.169">that he has won for us on the cross and</text>
  <text start="230.319" dur="6.87">that&amp;#39;s all that is needed now I won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="233.979" dur="5.551">disagree with the fact that a lot of us</text>
  <text start="237.189" dur="4.44">tend to minimize and probably don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.53" dur="5.25">appreciate enough what Jesus actually</text>
  <text start="241.629" dur="5.76">did on the cross there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="244.78" dur="5.129">people I think who do not appreciate</text>
  <text start="247.389" dur="5.34">fully what Jesus did for us on the cross</text>
  <text start="249.909" dur="5.67">and part of my calling is to help people</text>
  <text start="252.729" dur="5.73">understand exactly what Jesus did do on</text>
  <text start="255.579" dur="5.39">the cross but I would say this I think</text>
  <text start="258.459" dur="5.341">we need to take a comprehensive view of</text>
  <text start="260.969" dur="5.5">what it is exactly that Jesus did when</text>
  <text start="263.8" dur="4.95">he suffered and died on the cross now if</text>
  <text start="266.469" dur="4.92">you are at all familiar with divine</text>
  <text start="268.75" dur="5.849">healing you are probably well versed in</text>
  <text start="271.389" dur="6.15">the scriptures that illustrate what</text>
  <text start="274.599" dur="4.921">Jesus did for us on the cross know one</text>
  <text start="277.539" dur="4.321">verse that many people kind of their</text>
  <text start="279.52" dur="4.38">go-to verse for healing comes from</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="3.45">Isaiah chapter 53 it&amp;#39;s verse 5</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="3.66">but he was wounded for our</text>
  <text start="285.31" dur="4.35">transgressions he was bruised for our</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="4.59">iniquities the chastisement for our</text>
  <text start="289.66" dur="4.44">peace was upon him and by His stripes we</text>
  <text start="292.15" dur="3.72">are healed most people understand if</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="4.11">they&amp;#39;ve operated in healing that when</text>
  <text start="295.87" dur="4.5">Jesus went to the cross his body was</text>
  <text start="298.21" dur="5.549">broken he was bruised for our iniquities</text>
  <text start="300.37" dur="6.15">and by His stripes we are healed at</text>
  <text start="303.759" dur="5.551">least physically healed the question we</text>
  <text start="306.52" dur="5.67">have to ask ourselves is when Jesus died</text>
  <text start="309.31" dur="5.52">on the cross to appropriate our healing</text>
  <text start="312.19" dur="4.56">for us how exactly does that healing</text>
  <text start="314.83" dur="3.93">happen when we&amp;#39;re born many of us are</text>
  <text start="316.75" dur="4.56">born with birth defects as we go through</text>
  <text start="318.76" dur="5.01">life many of us suffer illness we suffer</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="4.919">injury and we aren&amp;#39;t automatically</text>
  <text start="323.77" dur="5.01">healed when we are born again become</text>
  <text start="326.229" dur="5.25">believers we are made a new creation our</text>
  <text start="328.78" dur="4.859">spirit man is renewed with the</text>
  <text start="331.479" dur="5.131">indwelling of the Holy Spirit but many</text>
  <text start="333.639" dur="4.951">of us still have physical injuries we</text>
  <text start="336.61" dur="3.69">have illnesses we have sickness and</text>
  <text start="338.59" dur="3.69">disease none of this happens</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="4.95">automatically we all understand that</text>
  <text start="342.28" dur="5.79">healing has to be released through</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="4.68">believers we pray for the sick we lay</text>
  <text start="348.07" dur="3.15">hands on them we release the power of</text>
  <text start="349.93" dur="4.65">God and people are healed</text>
  <text start="351.22" dur="6.06">how is emotional healing done well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="354.58" dur="5.64">done exactly the same way just as we</text>
  <text start="357.28" dur="5.43">must administer physical healing to</text>
  <text start="360.22" dur="4.65">people who are sick we also need to</text>
  <text start="362.71" dur="4.5">administer emotional healing to those</text>
  <text start="364.87" dur="4.71">who are emotionally traumatized there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="367.21" dur="5.25">no difference between the two well we</text>
  <text start="369.58" dur="5.25">all know Isaiah 53 verse 5</text>
  <text start="372.46" dur="6.06">many of us have overlooked Isaiah 53</text>
  <text start="374.83" dur="6.36">verse 4 verse 4 is actually the</text>
  <text start="378.52" dur="4.59">beginning of the prophet Isaiah speaking</text>
  <text start="381.19" dur="4.32">about what Jesus won for us on the cross</text>
  <text start="383.11" dur="4.92">and verse 4 reads surely he has borne</text>
  <text start="385.51" dur="5.37">our griefs and carried our sorrows yet</text>
  <text start="388.03" dur="5.1">we esteemed him stricken smitten by God</text>
  <text start="390.88" dur="5.58">and afflicted if you look at that this</text>
  <text start="393.13" dur="6.69">says he the Messiah has borne our griefs</text>
  <text start="396.46" dur="5.1">and carried our sorrows well what do you</text>
  <text start="399.82" dur="3.99">think that&amp;#39;s talking about that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="401.56" dur="4.74">talking about emotional trauma that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.81" dur="4.8">talking about pain and emotional wounds</text>
  <text start="406.3" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s talking about sadness and despair</text>
  <text start="408.61" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s talking about anger and</text>
  <text start="410.32" dur="5.76">disappointment right here in the very</text>
  <text start="413.44" dur="4.35">same passage where we all understand</text>
  <text start="416.08" dur="4.26">that Jesus died on the cross</text>
  <text start="417.79" dur="5.34">to win our physical healing it also says</text>
  <text start="420.34" dur="4.83">that he died for us and suffered to give</text>
  <text start="423.13" dur="5.22">us emotional healing well there are some</text>
  <text start="425.17" dur="3.84">people who probably require long periods</text>
  <text start="428.35" dur="3.21">of Prayer</text>
  <text start="429.01" dur="3.84">that takes years to get them healed of</text>
  <text start="431.56" dur="2.76">all of the things that have happened to</text>
  <text start="432.85" dur="3.69">them the people I&amp;#39;m thinking of in</text>
  <text start="434.32" dur="4.86">particular are those who have suffered</text>
  <text start="436.54" dur="5.88">severe emotional trauma satanic ritual</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="5.34">abuse and have what was formerly called</text>
  <text start="442.42" dur="4.83">multiple personality disorder but is now</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="4.68">called dissociative identity soar those</text>
  <text start="447.25" dur="4.74">people are being successfully treated</text>
  <text start="449.2" dur="5.25">today by people who work in emotional</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="5.76">healing and deliverance and the road to</text>
  <text start="454.45" dur="5.49">recovery for those survivors is long and</text>
  <text start="457.75" dur="4.74">it can be grueling but they are getting</text>
  <text start="459.94" dur="4.86">free and they&amp;#39;re not getting healed by</text>
  <text start="462.49" dur="4.56">the big-name ministries they are getting</text>
  <text start="464.8" dur="4.62">healed by people like Steve Harmon who</text>
  <text start="467.05" dur="5.22">work with them week after week month</text>
  <text start="469.42" dur="4.5">after month over the course usually of a</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="3.81">year or two and they work through all</text>
  <text start="473.92" dur="4.65">the pain and the emotional trauma and</text>
  <text start="476.08" dur="5.07">the mental programming and the lies and</text>
  <text start="478.57" dur="4.46">the demonic devices have been put on</text>
  <text start="481.15" dur="4.65">these people there&amp;#39;s all kinds of</text>
  <text start="483.03" dur="4.39">different aspects that are involved in</text>
  <text start="485.8" dur="4.05">getting people healed of emotional</text>
  <text start="487.42" dur="5.28">trauma I don&amp;#39;t deal a lot with people</text>
  <text start="489.85" dur="5.81">who have been severely traumatized I</text>
  <text start="492.7" dur="5.43">primarily deal with people who have had</text>
  <text start="495.66" dur="3.7">less severe trauma although I have</text>
  <text start="498.13" dur="3.48">ministered to some people who have had</text>
  <text start="499.36" dur="5.07">pretty severe emotional trauma now it</text>
  <text start="501.61" dur="4.8">all the time that I&amp;#39;ve been doing prayer</text>
  <text start="504.43" dur="4.32">for healing and in all the hundreds of</text>
  <text start="506.41" dur="5.25">dreams that the Lord has given me he has</text>
  <text start="508.75" dur="6.39">never actually given me any revelation</text>
  <text start="511.66" dur="6.99">about generational sins generational</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="6.42">curses about bloodlines I don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="518.65" dur="5.37">personal revelation that has anything to</text>
  <text start="521.56" dur="4.53">do with that type of prayer I have some</text>
  <text start="524.02" dur="4.74">friends who operate in that type of</text>
  <text start="526.09" dur="4.35">ministry and they seem to have a lot of</text>
  <text start="528.76" dur="4.2">success and what they do</text>
  <text start="530.44" dur="5.07">I personally don&amp;#39;t operate in that type</text>
  <text start="532.96" dur="5.04">of ministry but I&amp;#39;m not going to say</text>
  <text start="535.51" dur="4.74">that because the Lord hasn&amp;#39;t revealed it</text>
  <text start="538" dur="4.76">to me that he hasn&amp;#39;t revealed it to</text>
  <text start="540.25" dur="5.49">other people I think he has and I think</text>
  <text start="542.76" dur="5.5">that each of us has a different</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="4.77">understanding of how healing works</text>
  <text start="548.26" dur="2.73">we&amp;#39;re all given different pieces of the</text>
  <text start="550.51" dur="3.3">puzzle</text>
  <text start="550.99" dur="5.91">and I think that it&amp;#39;s only when we all</text>
  <text start="553.81" dur="4.74">come together and share the pieces of</text>
  <text start="556.9" dur="3.93">the puzzle that we have that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="558.55" dur="4.32">have a complete picture of what healing</text>
  <text start="560.83" dur="3.72">looks like I would like to share a dream</text>
  <text start="562.87" dur="4.29">that I had a few years ago that kind of</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="5.16">illustrates this point in this dream it</text>
  <text start="567.16" dur="4.83">took place in the far distant future and</text>
  <text start="569.71" dur="4.86">I was working as I guess what I would</text>
  <text start="571.99" dur="5.1">call a healing technician I came to work</text>
  <text start="574.57" dur="4.86">every day and I would check into</text>
  <text start="577.09" dur="4.29">something that was like a kiosk I would</text>
  <text start="579.43" dur="3.84">look at the records of the people I was</text>
  <text start="581.38" dur="3.9">going to pray for that day I would pull</text>
  <text start="583.27" dur="5.37">up one record at a time and I would</text>
  <text start="585.28" dur="5.46">review the type of illness that this</text>
  <text start="588.64" dur="4.41">person had and that review the type of</text>
  <text start="590.74" dur="4.77">prayer they had already received I would</text>
  <text start="593.05" dur="5.25">pray and my prayers would be guided by</text>
  <text start="595.51" dur="5.31">what I would see in visions my prayers</text>
  <text start="598.3" dur="4.88">were recorded and they became a</text>
  <text start="600.82" dur="5.34">permanent part of the person&amp;#39;s record</text>
  <text start="603.18" dur="5.68">that person would then go on to someone</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="5.82">else who would pray for them using a</text>
  <text start="608.86" dur="5.4">different mode of prayer their prayers</text>
  <text start="611.98" dur="3.84">would be calm part of the record and</text>
  <text start="614.26" dur="4.5">that person would go on to a third</text>
  <text start="615.82" dur="4.11">person who had received a different type</text>
  <text start="618.76" dur="4.35">of prayer and they would go on to a</text>
  <text start="619.93" dur="5.61">fourth person now in the dream everybody</text>
  <text start="623.11" dur="5.31">received prayer from four different</text>
  <text start="625.54" dur="4.92">people and each one prayed in a</text>
  <text start="628.42" dur="4.41">different way everybody was always</text>
  <text start="630.46" dur="4.11">healed because they received prayer from</text>
  <text start="632.83" dur="3.63">four different people who prayed for</text>
  <text start="634.57" dur="5.1">different ways I think the dream</text>
  <text start="636.46" dur="5.07">represents the idea well it represents a</text>
  <text start="639.67" dur="4.53">lot of things one of the things that</text>
  <text start="641.53" dur="5.31">represents is the fact that there are</text>
  <text start="644.2" dur="4.56">different ways to pray different ways to</text>
  <text start="646.84" dur="4.17">release healing different ways to</text>
  <text start="648.76" dur="5.76">release power different ways to use</text>
  <text start="651.01" dur="6.12">Authority there are different problems</text>
  <text start="654.52" dur="4.14">that we come up against I had a friend</text>
  <text start="657.13" dur="3.72">who sent me a private message this week</text>
  <text start="658.66" dur="4.59">he told me about this problem where his</text>
  <text start="660.85" dur="3.96">scalp had been bleeding for years he</text>
  <text start="663.25" dur="3.66">would wake up in the morning in his</text>
  <text start="664.81" dur="4.98">pillow would be basically be soaked with</text>
  <text start="666.91" dur="6">blood he had all kinds of sores on his</text>
  <text start="669.79" dur="5.07">scalp and there wasn&amp;#39;t anything that was</text>
  <text start="672.91" dur="4.56">actually causing this to happen that he</text>
  <text start="674.86" dur="5.61">could discern he didn&amp;#39;t have any kind of</text>
  <text start="677.47" dur="4.95">a rash he didn&amp;#39;t have any trauma he had</text>
  <text start="680.47" dur="3.15">seen doctors for they had no explanation</text>
  <text start="682.42" dur="4.02">for it</text>
  <text start="683.62" dur="5.34">and yet it persisted for years Oh give</text>
  <text start="686.44" dur="4.98">you the short version of this one day</text>
  <text start="688.96" dur="4.32">his wife was praying and she saw an</text>
  <text start="691.42" dur="4.62">angel standing behind him they were</text>
  <text start="693.28" dur="5.4">praying to discern what was causing his</text>
  <text start="696.04" dur="4.83">scalp to bleed his wife saw the Angels</text>
  <text start="698.68" dur="5.16">standing behind him and she also saw</text>
  <text start="700.87" dur="4.89">something like a metal skullcap that had</text>
  <text start="703.84" dur="3.99">metal tabs that were buried into his</text>
  <text start="705.76" dur="5.07">scalp and this is what was causing the</text>
  <text start="707.83" dur="4.89">bleeding the angel then took this thing</text>
  <text start="710.83" dur="3.9">off of his head and just removed it and</text>
  <text start="712.72" dur="5.46">he said I could feel the blood start to</text>
  <text start="714.73" dur="6.66">run down my scalp he at that point he</text>
  <text start="718.18" dur="5.28">was bleeding pretty significantly but</text>
  <text start="721.39" dur="4.41">eventually the bleeding stopped and then</text>
  <text start="723.46" dur="5.19">he said the angel brought a vial of oil</text>
  <text start="725.8" dur="4.92">and dumped the vial of oil on his head</text>
  <text start="728.65" dur="5.46">and he could feel it running down over</text>
  <text start="730.72" dur="5.31">his head and since that day he has had</text>
  <text start="734.11" dur="5.36">not had any problems with his scalp</text>
  <text start="736.03" dur="7.62">leading one of my friends Matt Evans is</text>
  <text start="739.47" dur="6.7">a guy who has a very well-developed</text>
  <text start="743.65" dur="5.12">ability to see in the spirit when Matt</text>
  <text start="746.17" dur="5.19">prays for people he will often see</text>
  <text start="748.77" dur="3.18">demonic devices that are placed on</text>
  <text start="751.36" dur="3.39">people</text>
  <text start="751.95" dur="6.73">one of the ways that we have to learn</text>
  <text start="754.75" dur="6.54">how to get people healed is to see in</text>
  <text start="758.68" dur="4.74">the spirit and see specific things that</text>
  <text start="761.29" dur="6.15">need to be removed I hate to be a</text>
  <text start="763.42" dur="6.36">legalist but the reality of divine</text>
  <text start="767.44" dur="6.33">healing is there are things out there</text>
  <text start="769.78" dur="7.17">that the enemy does to people that if we</text>
  <text start="773.77" dur="5.55">cannot identify a specific thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="776.95" dur="4.29">causing an affliction or a sickness</text>
  <text start="779.32" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;re never going to get that person</text>
  <text start="781.24" dur="5.91">healed we have to be able to discern</text>
  <text start="783.82" dur="5.58">what it is that is the root of their</text>
  <text start="787.15" dur="4.44">sickness what is the cause what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="789.4" dur="4.89">demonic origin and we have to remove</text>
  <text start="791.59" dur="4.38">everything that the enemy has done we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="794.29" dur="7.56">not going to get people healed any other</text>
  <text start="795.97" dur="9.5">way so my perspective on this is I try</text>
  <text start="801.85" dur="6.45">not to criticize or condemn people who</text>
  <text start="805.47" dur="5.32">operate in a way that is different than</text>
  <text start="808.3" dur="5.24">what I do there are a lot of different</text>
  <text start="810.79" dur="5.91">ways that people do divine healing and</text>
  <text start="813.54" dur="3.94">if they&amp;#39;re getting good results and if</text>
  <text start="816.7" dur="5.55">the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="817.48" dur="6.479">is the initiator of the process I am</text>
  <text start="822.25" dur="3.69">okay with whatever it is they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="823.959" dur="4.051">even if I don&amp;#39;t understand it even if</text>
  <text start="825.94" dur="4.199">I&amp;#39;ve never heard of it before I can say</text>
  <text start="828.01" dur="3.78">this over the last year or two that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="830.139" dur="5.551">been praying for people to receive</text>
  <text start="831.79" dur="6.51">emotional healing I have had tremendous</text>
  <text start="835.69" dur="5.759">success and this is not an exaggeration</text>
  <text start="838.3" dur="4.76">I would say more than 95% of the people</text>
  <text start="841.449" dur="4.711">that I pray with for emotional healing</text>
  <text start="843.06" dur="5.23">when the process is done and it usually</text>
  <text start="846.16" dur="4.5">takes 10 or 15 minutes maybe 20 minutes</text>
  <text start="848.29" dur="5.87">over 95% of the people that I pray with</text>
  <text start="850.66" dur="5.91">feel significantly different feel</text>
  <text start="854.16" dur="4.179">noticeably better after we&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="856.57" dur="4.98">through the prayer process either the</text>
  <text start="858.339" dur="4.591">anger is gone or the shame or the guilt</text>
  <text start="861.55" dur="3.93">or whatever it is they&amp;#39;ve been dealing</text>
  <text start="862.93" dur="3.3">with is lifted it&amp;#39;s completely gone they</text>
  <text start="865.48" dur="3.75">feel lighter</text>
  <text start="866.23" dur="5.4">they have joy and all I can say is that</text>
  <text start="869.23" dur="6.63">my experience with emotional healing is</text>
  <text start="871.63" dur="5.519">it works people can tell that something</text>
  <text start="875.86" dur="3.089">has changed when you&amp;#39;ve gone through the</text>
  <text start="877.149" dur="3.63">process and a number of people have</text>
  <text start="878.949" dur="4.051">actually received healing of physical</text>
  <text start="880.779" dur="5.31">symptoms after we&amp;#39;ve gone through the</text>
  <text start="883" dur="6.36">emotional healing process so if you are</text>
  <text start="886.089" dur="6.36">a skeptic if you&amp;#39;re a doubter about the</text>
  <text start="889.36" dur="6.12">validity of emotional healing all I can</text>
  <text start="892.449" dur="4.741">suggest you is to try it if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="895.48" dur="3.03">seeing 100 percent of the people that</text>
  <text start="897.19" dur="3.329">you pray for healed then I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="898.51" dur="3.689">worry about it what you&amp;#39;re doing is fine</text>
  <text start="900.519" dur="3.961">and I would not worry about emotional</text>
  <text start="902.199" dur="4.111">healing but if you&amp;#39;re praying for a</text>
  <text start="904.48" dur="5.359">significant number of people who are not</text>
  <text start="906.31" dur="6.45">healed I would challenge you to consider</text>
  <text start="909.839" dur="4.24">learning something about emotional</text>
  <text start="912.76" dur="4.05">healing the process that I use is very</text>
  <text start="914.079" dur="4.771">simple it doesn&amp;#39;t take a long time you</text>
  <text start="916.81" dur="5.279">don&amp;#39;t need to take a class it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="918.85" dur="6.06">pretty easy it&amp;#39;s biblical if that helps</text>
  <text start="922.089" dur="6.06">and it&amp;#39;s all Jesus I just invite Jesus</text>
  <text start="924.91" dur="6.15">into the prayer dynamic I usually just</text>
  <text start="928.149" dur="5.88">ask the individual to recall whatever</text>
  <text start="931.06" dur="4.769">painful memories they can recall name</text>
  <text start="934.029" dur="4.411">the emotion that they&amp;#39;re feeling ask</text>
  <text start="935.829" dur="5.161">them to give the emotion to Jesus as</text>
  <text start="938.44" dur="4.47">Jesus to heal a wound in their soul when</text>
  <text start="940.99" dur="3.839">we go back and go through the event and</text>
  <text start="942.91" dur="3.929">have them recall the memory whatever</text>
  <text start="944.829" dur="3.521">they were feeling before the shame the</text>
  <text start="946.839" dur="3.881">guilt</text>
  <text start="948.35" dur="5.43">anger is gone it&amp;#39;s completely gone</text>
  <text start="950.72" dur="5.7">usually they can remember the event but</text>
  <text start="953.78" dur="5.79">the associated emotion is completely</text>
  <text start="956.42" dur="4.8">gone so like I said if if you have any</text>
  <text start="959.57" dur="3.6">doubts about emotional healing I would</text>
  <text start="961.22" dur="3.99">just challenge you to try it it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="963.17" dur="3.57">gonna hurt anything and you may actually</text>
  <text start="965.21" dur="3.87">start seeing a lot more people healed</text>
