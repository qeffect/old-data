  <text start="129.5" dur="5.13">when they hear your story they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="131.63" dur="5.19">to be shaking their head going wow how</text>
  <text start="134.63" dur="7.23">did that happen well I think it&amp;#39;s a case</text>
  <text start="136.82" dur="8.22">of exactly you know I say God can save</text>
  <text start="141.86" dur="5.19">me you can save anybody I said the same</text>
  <text start="145.04" dur="4.14">thing I said the same thing for many</text>
  <text start="147.05" dur="3.72">years because because you and I have a</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="3.93">similar background</text>
  <text start="150.77" dur="7.89">actually a lot of people don&amp;#39;t know this</text>
  <text start="153.11" dur="8.34">but in the 1990s I was actually helping</text>
  <text start="158.66" dur="6.21">run a new-age radio program on public</text>
  <text start="161.45" dur="7.2">radio I considered myself actually to be</text>
  <text start="164.87" dur="6.9">an atheist most of my adult life but I</text>
  <text start="168.65" dur="4.8">got interested in new-age music and this</text>
  <text start="171.77" dur="3.84">fellow was he was a student at the</text>
  <text start="173.45" dur="5.28">University that had a radio program and</text>
  <text start="175.61" dur="5.01">he was a radio broadcast major and he</text>
  <text start="178.73" dur="3.03">had to produce this program but he</text>
  <text start="180.62" dur="3.66">didn&amp;#39;t know anything about new-age music</text>
  <text start="181.76" dur="4.8">so he was playing music that wasn&amp;#39;t very</text>
  <text start="184.28" dur="4.29">good and I called him up a couple of</text>
  <text start="186.56" dur="3.84">times and I said I given some requests</text>
  <text start="188.57" dur="3.63">of music I wanted to hear we got to</text>
  <text start="190.4" dur="5.73">talking he invited me down to the studio</text>
  <text start="192.2" dur="6.18">so I went down and he allowed me to help</text>
  <text start="196.13" dur="4.44">him pick out music that would be</text>
  <text start="198.38" dur="3.39">appropriate because I knew what music</text>
  <text start="200.57" dur="2.76">people like to listen to and he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="201.77" dur="4.23">he didn&amp;#39;t care anything about new-age</text>
  <text start="203.33" dur="5.07">music he just had to do this radio show</text>
  <text start="206" dur="4.53">as part of a credit for his class so I</text>
  <text start="208.4" dur="3.96">actually ended up selecting most of the</text>
  <text start="210.53" dur="4.44">music and then doing so the on-air time</text>
  <text start="212.36" dur="4.23">introducing the music and I kind of got</text>
  <text start="214.97" dur="4.32">into meditation a little bit at that</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="6.33">time but I never got very far into the</text>
  <text start="219.29" dur="6.18">new age fortunately for me my my a</text>
  <text start="222.92" dur="5.46">theistic beliefs really kept me from</text>
  <text start="225.47" dur="5.58">pursuing anything really spiritual but</text>
  <text start="228.38" dur="7.2">you were very interested in in New Age</text>
  <text start="231.05" dur="6.24">spirituality in your 20s yeah I was yeah</text>
  <text start="235.58" dur="3.36">I mean I never does actually came out of</text>
  <text start="237.29" dur="3.96">a Christian backdrop and that&amp;#39;s the odd</text>
  <text start="238.94" dur="4.62">thing is you&amp;#39;re you were born it&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="241.25" dur="4.89">grandmother actually was a Christian yes</text>
  <text start="243.56" dur="4.43">your parents were not believers no not</text>
  <text start="246.14" dur="4.319">but your grandmother took you to church</text>
  <text start="247.99" dur="4.63">well she she took us to church so much</text>
  <text start="250.459" dur="4.231">but as when she used to come and stay</text>
  <text start="252.62" dur="5.369">with us at my parents house you&amp;#39;d read</text>
  <text start="254.69" dur="5.91">the Bible to us as children six seven</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="3.991">years old I still have a good news Bible</text>
  <text start="260.6" dur="4.49">in fact the very power that I started</text>
  <text start="261.98" dur="8.64">reading it in my testimony yeah signed</text>
  <text start="265.09" dur="9.88">1982 dear Ellen love Grand cook so yeah</text>
  <text start="270.62" dur="6.84">but I mean so I I grew up in a in there</text>
  <text start="274.97" dur="6.36">was no belief in the house as in as in</text>
  <text start="277.46" dur="5.31">faith wise but then at the age of 12 or</text>
  <text start="281.33" dur="3.21">went to boarding school it was a</text>
  <text start="282.77" dur="3.21">Christian school so okay</text>
  <text start="284.54" dur="3.36">you know it was a church school so</text>
  <text start="285.98" dur="4.14">Methodists or Baptists - whatever I can</text>
  <text start="287.9" dur="5.25">remember but it was a church school and</text>
  <text start="290.12" dur="4.32">they the Warthog were perfect it was a</text>
  <text start="293.15" dur="3.5">private school you know the private</text>
  <text start="294.44" dur="4.64">schools in South Africa founded on</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="4.06">Anglican Church or Methodist Church</text>
  <text start="299.08" dur="2.98">somewhere Longman</text>
  <text start="300.71" dur="3.51">and so this particular school that I</text>
  <text start="302.06" dur="3.66">went to it was a Christian based school</text>
  <text start="304.22" dur="4.14">and I gave my life to the Lord school</text>
  <text start="305.72" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;d to him I was a Christian ya could</text>
  <text start="308.36" dur="4.29">hear God I could sense him how could I</text>
  <text start="310.4" dur="4.68">love reading so he actually had a</text>
  <text start="312.65" dur="4.29">relationship with the Lord at that time</text>
  <text start="315.08" dur="4.29">you could hear his voice you could sense</text>
  <text start="316.94" dur="5.84">his presence yeah everything I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="319.37" dur="6.27">know in the States works but that was</text>
  <text start="322.78" dur="5.38">seven five seven years before my school</text>
  <text start="325.64" dur="4.08">system finished my schooling first so</text>
  <text start="328.16" dur="4.37">that&amp;#39;s twelve twelve or thirteen years</text>
  <text start="329.72" dur="5.01">old then I changed schools and are</text>
  <text start="332.53" dur="4.69">despised I think would be the best way</text>
  <text start="334.73" dur="4.65">to put at my new school it was a very</text>
  <text start="337.22" dur="5.07">tough time for me I went from the school</text>
  <text start="339.38" dur="5.64">that I loved very outdoors focused to a</text>
  <text start="342.29" dur="4.71">very sporting school and you ran into a</text>
  <text start="345.02" dur="3.39">lot of rejection at that time at that</text>
  <text start="347" dur="5.46">point a lot of bullying a lot of</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="6.12">rejection a lot of hurt and but but I</text>
  <text start="352.46" dur="5.25">kept my faith but I think being at a</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="5.4">boarding school I had a fairly sheltered</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="4.05">upbringing my first year of university I</text>

  <text start="540.17" dur="6.029">get introduced to</text>
  <text start="542.56" dur="6.19">sangoma well you know what happened was</text>
  <text start="546.199" dur="3.99">we used to do community development to</text>
  <text start="548.75" dur="3.39">us through the company that I was</text>
  <text start="550.189" dur="3.751">working for and so we used to go down</text>
  <text start="552.14" dur="3.84">it was a phase called the value of a</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="6">thousand pills outside of Durban and</text>
  <text start="555.98" dur="6.75">kwazulu-natal and we did a tour in a</text>
  <text start="559.94" dur="3.839">rural community where it was packed</text>
  <text start="562.73" dur="3">along the side of the river</text>
  <text start="563.779" dur="4.74">they are literal scenes and we get a</text>
  <text start="565.73" dur="4.38">local guide take us around and we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="568.519" dur="3.181">from hack to axon and introduce the</text>
  <text start="570.11" dur="3.45">tourists the people living there and</text>

  <text start="573.56" dur="3.6">cheering every day laughs experiences</text>
  <text start="575.089" dur="5.611">but we always made a point of going to</text>
  <text start="577.16" dur="4.89">see a sangoma but it was more to just a</text>
  <text start="580.7" dur="3.449">different aspect to the culture and</text>
  <text start="582.05" dur="4.08">order from a spiritual perspective for</text>
  <text start="584.149" dur="6.481">the benefit of the listeners who aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="586.13" dur="7.05">familiar with what a st. Goma is okay I</text>
  <text start="590.63" dur="3.93">say no but it could be defined in the</text>
  <text start="593.18" dur="3.469">opinion which started for you on</text>
  <text start="594.56" dur="5.64">anything from a traditional healer to a</text>
  <text start="596.649" dur="5.741">spiritualist to what some people might</text>
  <text start="600.2" dur="5.759">call assignment or witch doctor okay</text>
  <text start="602.39" dur="5.16">okay so you would go and visit you yeah</text>
  <text start="605.959" dur="3.661">but just learn to the house and listen</text>
  <text start="607.55" dur="3.63">to some drumming there normally be</text>
  <text start="609.62" dur="3.48">trying out herbs and made a syndrome</text>
  <text start="611.18" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;d show the people it and the guide</text>
  <text start="613.1" dur="4.02">would explain what&amp;#39;s what and so because</text>
  <text start="615.89" dur="3.18">I was interested in herbalism and</text>
  <text start="617.12" dur="4.98">particular indigenous plants it was a it</text>
  <text start="619.07" dur="5.879">piqued my interest at the same time we</text>
  <text start="622.1" dur="5.58">used to do a tour that went to a shack</text>
  <text start="624.949" dur="5.401">and a Township and there what would</text>
  <text start="627.68" dur="4.32">happen is the tourists would be taken</text>
  <text start="630.35" dur="3.599">through it got by guide through the</text>
  <text start="632" dur="4.74">shacks and the shanty town and they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="633.949" dur="5.341">end up at this lady&amp;#39;s house where they&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="636.74" dur="5.07">have a meal and a couple of beers with</text>
  <text start="639.29" dur="4.5">the locals and shoot some pool and their</text>

  <text start="868.81" dur="6.36">dream but I can still feel the snake is</text>
  <text start="871.18" dur="7.47">touching me so I move as slowly as I can</text>
  <text start="875.17" dur="6.09">and I&amp;#39;ve turned the light on behind me</text>

  <text start="964.18" dur="3.69">first thing she asked me she&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="965.68" dur="4.62">color was a snake and I said it was</text>
  <text start="967.87" dur="5.13">green and purple and she starts you know</text>

  <text start="976.3" dur="5.46">looks at me and says I knew that this</text>
  <text start="979.36" dur="4.56">was going to happen but because you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="981.76" dur="5.61">white person that couldn&amp;#39;t explain it to</text>
  <text start="983.92" dur="5.729">you but that snake is your ancestral</text>
  <text start="987.37" dur="5.459">spirits that have now come to live with</text>
  <text start="989.649" dur="5.851">you and it&amp;#39;s proof that you need to</text>
  <text start="992.829" dur="5.07">train as what she turned in in yangon</text>
  <text start="995.5" dur="3.39">and younger is a herbalist I guess you</text>

  <text start="998.89" dur="3.449">yangon and you get a Sun balm and suck</text>
  <text start="1000.329" dur="5.491">you get a herbalist and then you get I</text>
  <text start="1002.339" dur="4.711">suppose a psychic know Shaymin and they</text>
  <text start="1005.82" dur="3.209">both got different roles but they</text>
  <text start="1007.05" dur="3.75">complement each other and in yangon</text>
  <text start="1009.029" dur="3.631">would dispense the medicine but the the</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="3.99">Sun hormone would works purely on the</text>
  <text start="1012.66" dur="3.65">spiritual side so I love to turn her</text>
  <text start="1014.79" dur="6.049">wings okay</text>
  <text start="1016.31" dur="6.85">just like that okay I use anything</text>

  <text start="1027.87" dur="5.339">three years out of apartheid no one got</text>
  <text start="1031.38" dur="4.169">this opportunity I didn&amp;#39;t know of any</text>
  <text start="1033.209" dur="5.46">other white people doing this and I just</text>
  <text start="1035.549" dur="5.16">thought wow wow wow this is a fantastic</text>
  <text start="1038.669" dur="4.321">opportunity one to learn a completely</text>
  <text start="1040.709" dur="4.86">new culture and to EXCI be able to</text>
  <text start="1042.99" dur="5.16">relate between whites and black and and</text>
  <text start="1045.569" dur="5.581">and and even for myself for interest in</text>
  <text start="1048.15" dur="4.92">herbs and and so on so she says to me no</text>
  <text start="1051.15" dur="5.279">no no you don&amp;#39;t understand once you</text>
  <text start="1053.07" dur="5.43">start you can never stop and you need to</text>
  <text start="1056.429" dur="3.75">be very very serious about this</text>
  <text start="1058.5" dur="3.69">situation this is not a joke this is a</text>
  <text start="1060.179" dur="4.291">life did she explain to you the</text>
  <text start="1062.19" dur="4.77">consequences if you would try to leave</text>
  <text start="1064.47" dur="4.92">not at the time she just said to me you</text>
  <text start="1066.96" dur="4.2">what if you start you cannot stop and I</text>
  <text start="1069.39" dur="4.169">yeah I heard it but it was one of those</text>
  <text start="1071.16" dur="4.53">let them actually really register and</text>
  <text start="1073.559" dur="5.341">you didn&amp;#39;t know what that actually meant</text>
  <text start="1075.69" dur="6.78">yeah not at all not at all okay so so</text>
  <text start="1078.9" dur="5.55">anyway I mean I I pretty much made up a</text>
  <text start="1082.47" dur="4.05">mind at that moment she said to me go</text>
  <text start="1084.45" dur="4.11">home think about it</text>
  <text start="1086.52" dur="5.01">and come back in hindsight I don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1088.56" dur="4.92">to know have had much of a choice I went</text>
  <text start="1091.53" dur="5.01">back the next day oh and I said I&amp;#39;m in</text>
  <text start="1093.48" dur="5.07">and of course from her side it was</text>
  <text start="1096.54" dur="4.5">something she&amp;#39;d never ever trained in</text>
  <text start="1098.55" dur="4.74">English or watch english South African</text>
  <text start="1101.04" dur="4.47">before in an entire life now the thing</text>

  <text start="1108.24" dur="5.13">to teach yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s not just anyone</text>
  <text start="1110.91" dur="4.41">yes right it has to be a specific person</text>
  <text start="1113.37" dur="4.29">that&amp;#39;s pointed out to them to them yes</text>
  <text start="1115.32" dur="5.58">exactly so so I went back and I said</text>
  <text start="1117.66" dur="6.21">okay so she said you sure and I said yes</text>
  <text start="1120.9" dur="5.25">okay off we go to the market and it was</text>
  <text start="1123.87" dur="6.9">literally from now on your life is over</text>
  <text start="1126.15" dur="7.77">as LM partying drinking whatever it was</text>

  <text start="1133.92" dur="4.44">party animal to living in a monastery</text>
  <text start="1136.07" dur="7.21">literally that must have been a cultural</text>
  <text start="1138.36" dur="6.9">shock it it was but at the same time it</text>
  <text start="1143.28" dur="4.14">was just something about me that this is</text>

  <text start="1151.32" dur="3.99">discipline but it but not only that I</text>

  <text start="1157.74" dur="5.76">and even amongst the African people it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1328.95" dur="3.689">family you&amp;#39;d literally become a very</text>
  <text start="1330.869" dur="3.481">member of their family and everything</text>
  <text start="1332.639" dur="3.961">they had was yours and everything you</text>

  <text start="1336.6" dur="4.89">and I had a stayed in a house house</text>
  <text start="1339.539" dur="4.561">where they made a special deal with me</text>
  <text start="1341.49" dur="4.259">that if I was working I had to then</text>
  <text start="1344.1" dur="4.289">obviously I could go to work and I could</text>
  <text start="1345.749" dur="5.37">go home after that but every free moment</text>
  <text start="1348.389" dur="4.301">that I had I had to basically live at</text>
  <text start="1351.119" dur="3.101">the house</text>
  <text start="1352.69" dur="3.63">became a mom she&amp;#39;s literally said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1354.22" dur="2.93">your mom now and she treated you like a</text>
  <text start="1356.32" dur="4.26">son</text>
  <text start="1357.15" dur="5.29">exactly like a son exactly every single</text>
  <text start="1360.58" dur="3.87">food twice that she treated exactly like</text>
  <text start="1362.44" dur="5.7">a son they were adopted into a family</text>
  <text start="1364.45" dur="5.64">full rights of being a son because I was</text>
  <text start="1368.14" dur="4.56">an adult I suppose maybe and maybe booze</text>
  <text start="1370.09" dur="4.56">özil I was unique in the sense of view</text>
  <text start="1372.7" dur="4.38">of skin color and culture might have got</text>
  <text start="1374.65" dur="4.68">to put a preferential treatment but the</text>
  <text start="1377.08" dur="5.49">idea is that as an enforcer you treated</text>
  <text start="1379.33" dur="6.09">as a son but you live as a slave so you</text>
  <text start="1382.57" dur="5.55">do or they work while you do you wash</text>
  <text start="1385.42" dur="4.53">the dishes you clean the floor you you</text>
  <text start="1388.12" dur="4.08">basically learn servanthood in a very</text>
  <text start="1389.95" dur="4.92">fast way and the way she learns is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1392.2" dur="4.62">all entirely hands-on you would go to a</text>
  <text start="1394.87" dur="4.41">mall and get the medicines or the France</text>
  <text start="1396.82" dur="3.93">or in this particular area of Durban</text>
  <text start="1399.28" dur="3.36">there were the guys who sold all the</text>
  <text start="1400.75" dur="5.7">plants I&amp;#39;d harvested and you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="1402.64" dur="5.61">huge and pick box in roots and and stuff</text>
  <text start="1406.45" dur="5.46">like that and then we would sit there</text>
  <text start="1408.25" dur="4.95">with our machetes and order until you</text>
  <text start="1411.91" dur="2.73">got blisters in your hands and feel the</text>
  <text start="1413.2" dur="3.81">blisters in your hands turn to calluses</text>
  <text start="1414.64" dur="4.65">and then you got new blisters and and</text>
  <text start="1417.01" dur="3.93">mix and match and she would explain to</text>
  <text start="1419.29" dur="3.39">you and should be seeing clients at the</text>
  <text start="1420.94" dur="4.23">same time of patients and you&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="1422.68" dur="5.37">sitting and with her and and learning as</text>
  <text start="1425.17" dur="4.83">she wins and at the same time so it was</text>
  <text start="1428.05" dur="3.51">very practical and there were a number</text>
  <text start="1430" dur="4.47">of us who are training at the same time</text>
  <text start="1431.56" dur="5.58">when I started there was a young lady in</text>
  <text start="1434.47" dur="4.17">the early twenties and Kesey with me and</text>
  <text start="1437.14" dur="3.54">then by the time I left you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="1438.64" dur="4.92">another five people or four people that</text>
  <text start="1440.68" dur="6.87">it was and a couple of the people who</text>
  <text start="1443.56" dur="6.54">started the course dropped out yeah what</text>
  <text start="1447.55" dur="5.46">happened was it&amp;#39;s very intensive it</text>
  <text start="1450.1" dur="4.8">really is it&amp;#39;s virtually the morning</text>
  <text start="1453.01" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s physically the morning it&amp;#39;s time to</text>
  <text start="1454.9" dur="5.64">morning and and there - the first one</text>
  <text start="1457.51" dur="4.86">wasn&amp;#39;t easy now what happened to her was</text>
  <text start="1460.54" dur="3.78">she was studying at the time at</text>
  <text start="1462.37" dur="5.13">University and she didn&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="1464.32" dur="4.65">this but her ancestors were Portugal to</text>
  <text start="1467.5" dur="3.66">that one the skirts or whatever now ah</text>
  <text start="1468.97" dur="3.96">yeah when you talk of ancestors I just</text>
  <text start="1471.16" dur="2.79">thought insist is all rubbish men</text>
  <text start="1472.93" dur="3.6">guarding spurts</text>
  <text start="1473.95" dur="5.82">guarding angels you know that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="1476.53" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s the difference because in in this</text>
  <text start="1479.77" dur="4.98">African culture they very much believed</text>
  <text start="1482.92" dur="3.31">that the spirits are speaking to their</text>
  <text start="1484.75" dur="3.64">ancestral spirits</text>
  <text start="1486.23" dur="5.34">you being from a new-age background you</text>
  <text start="1488.39" dur="5.82">thought no no these are not ancestors</text>
  <text start="1491.57" dur="4.59">exactly their guidance birds and so on</text>
  <text start="1494.21" dur="3.48">you know and different not ancestors I</text>
  <text start="1496.16" dur="3.33">mean and I mean they don&amp;#39;t even joke</text>
  <text start="1497.69" dur="4.14">some of them would say you know white</text>
  <text start="1499.49" dur="4.2">people don&amp;#39;t have ancestors I mean there</text>
  <text start="1501.83" dur="4.38">was a standard comment white people</text>
  <text start="1503.69" dur="4.59">don&amp;#39;t have ancestors anyway so this one</text>
  <text start="1506.21" dur="4.17">girl in pieces she decided to drop out</text>
  <text start="1508.28" dur="4.83">and now one would always say to me now</text>
  <text start="1510.38" dur="4.32">mom I refer to my Zulu mom missus to me</text>
  <text start="1513.11" dur="3.27">and she&amp;#39;s she really said you know if</text>
  <text start="1514.7" dur="3.84">you stop the spirits will kill you</text>
  <text start="1516.38" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s that once you start you constructed</text>
  <text start="1518.54" dur="4.23">that you they own and you you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1520.88" dur="4.26">dedicated your life to them when you</text>
  <text start="1522.77" dur="5.22">stop what will happen is if you disobey</text>
  <text start="1525.14" dur="4.68">them you&amp;#39;ll get bad luck and read other</text>
  <text start="1527.99" dur="3.3">shaman&amp;#39;s or witch doctors might attack</text>
  <text start="1529.82" dur="3.42">you and you&amp;#39;re always in a spiritual</text>
  <text start="1531.29" dur="3.57">battle and things will start going wrong</text>

  <text start="1534.86" dur="5.309">get mentally ill or you might just die</text>
  <text start="1537.35" dur="6">and that was a very real part of this</text>
  <text start="1540.169" dur="5.491">practice was the the curses and the</text>
  <text start="1543.35" dur="4.47">spells and the other witch doctors doing</text>
  <text start="1545.66" dur="3.57">all this stuff to people yeah that was</text>

  <text start="1728.81" dur="6.57">spiritual senses as such and to give you</text>
  <text start="1732.26" dur="6.03">power and it of course these feasts and</text>
  <text start="1735.38" dur="5.55">and what I noticed was every time I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1738.29" dur="5.61">get stronger every time and you could</text>
  <text start="1740.93" dur="6.45">feel at the stage the power it was you</text>
  <text start="1743.9" dur="5.91">it was day I can&amp;#39;t describe it I haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1747.38" dur="4.56">even as a Christian walking and healing</text>
  <text start="1749.81" dur="3.18">in that now I haven&amp;#39;t felt that like I</text>
  <text start="1751.94" dur="5.67">did there this</text>
  <text start="1752.99" dur="6.689">prisons was completely around and have</text>
  <text start="1757.61" dur="4.14">you thought about you know what you</text>
  <text start="1759.679" dur="6.061">would attribute that to that sensation</text>
  <text start="1761.75" dur="6.059">of power around you in hindsight it was</text>
  <text start="1765.74" dur="4.5">it was differently spurts you know I</text>
  <text start="1767.809" dur="5.401">think what a case of where it was was</text>
  <text start="1770.24" dur="5.76">you gave your life to something and that</text>
  <text start="1773.21" dur="6.63">thing then said I&amp;#39;m going to give you</text>
  <text start="1776" dur="6.24">power you you worship me and you follow</text>
  <text start="1779.84" dur="4.14">me and you obey me and I mean yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="1782.24" dur="3.87">even really like offer permission from</text>
  <text start="1783.98" dur="4.17">the spirits to go to the shop leftover</text>
  <text start="1786.11" dur="3.63">go buy milk down in what we call my</text>
  <text start="1788.15" dur="4.68">escort early in my little spirit corner</text>
  <text start="1789.74" dur="4.83">and I practice words would have to give</text>
  <text start="1792.83" dur="3.9">you permission to go to the shop yeah</text>
  <text start="1794.57" dur="4.95">and if you didn&amp;#39;t know and you went then</text>
  <text start="1796.73" dur="5.43">it would be suddenly do my dad luck or</text>
  <text start="1799.52" dur="5.49">retribution from the spirit is that it</text>
  <text start="1802.16" dur="5.43">so it&amp;#39;ll be absolutely ins all the time</text>
  <text start="1805.01" dur="6.48">you know I&amp;#39;ve heard from people who got</text>
  <text start="1807.59" dur="6.12">into Satanism that the reason why they</text>
  <text start="1811.49" dur="4.77">do human sacrifices and things of that</text>
  <text start="1813.71" dur="5.67">nature is because Satan has promised</text>
  <text start="1816.26" dur="5.16">them power if they obey well well it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1819.38" dur="4.11">all about power it is about power and</text>
  <text start="1821.42" dur="5.25">you see this is the irony of it years</text>

  <text start="2760.51" dur="3.21">then and it will come back to something</text>
  <text start="2761.77" dur="3.96">worse and and the irony of it was you</text>
  <text start="2763.72" dur="4.079">see we charged money so don&amp;#39;t be ten</text>
  <text start="2765.73" dur="3.9">rent for consultation not like not like</text>
  <text start="2767.799" dur="3.991">a doctor you go to now he charges a</text>
  <text start="2769.63" dur="4.41">small fortune book for consultation and</text>
  <text start="2771.79" dur="4.35">in depending on the medication varying</text>
  <text start="2774.04" dur="5.009">fees we charge almost nothing for</text>
  <text start="2776.14" dur="4.919">consultation but the medicine itself</text>
  <text start="2779.049" dur="4.081">could range from a couple of grands so</text>
  <text start="2781.059" dur="5.611">you know Holford fifty cents or a hard</text>
  <text start="2783.13" dur="5.64">dollar up to you know three or four five</text>
  <text start="2786.67" dur="4.83">hundred ran over a hundred dollars and</text>
  <text start="2788.77" dur="4.289">and these people they&amp;#39;ll go and instead</text>
  <text start="2791.5" dur="3.48">stuff would happen and then they would</text>
  <text start="2793.059" dur="3.871">come back and they&amp;#39;ll come back for</text>
  <text start="2794.98" dur="3.81">something else and it would be a greater</text>
  <text start="2796.93" dur="4.5">ailment or a different attack on</text>
  <text start="2798.79" dur="4.59">something else and keep saying but why</text>
  <text start="2801.43" dur="4.35">we don&amp;#39;t lose him now why they&amp;#39;re coming</text>
  <text start="2803.38" dur="4.979">back and she would say to me no no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2805.78" dur="5.37">because you&amp;#39;re so powerful now that the</text>
  <text start="2808.359" dur="4.861">Spurs are drawing them back and what I</text>
  <text start="2811.15" dur="3.689">realized in hindsight was you actually</text>
  <text start="2813.22" dur="4.2">created a spiritual bondage with them</text>
  <text start="2814.839" dur="4.53">you could you literally by them coming</text>
  <text start="2817.42" dur="3.48">to you and being ministered to you you</text>
  <text start="2819.369" dur="2.131">created you brought them into a</text>
  <text start="2820.9" dur="3.06">spiritual</text>
  <text start="2821.5" dur="5.28">without them even knowing it they were</text>
  <text start="2823.96" dur="4.38">now under your control</text>
  <text start="2826.78" dur="3.87">you didn&amp;#39;t control him as such as in</text>
  <text start="2828.34" dur="5.01">that mind control net but there was the</text>
  <text start="2830.65" dur="4.11">link there was dependency there was a</text>
  <text start="2833.35" dur="3.15">dependency and I suppose in some ways</text>
  <text start="2834.76" dur="3.81">what someone might quoted today in</text>
  <text start="2836.5" dur="5.52">Christian circles it was a sole tactic</text>
  <text start="2838.57" dur="5.01">right okay and so they would compose</text>
  <text start="2842.02" dur="3.84">this worked lost time so let&amp;#39;s go</text>
  <text start="2843.58" dur="5.04">straight back to that person again and I</text>
  <text start="2845.86" dur="4.71">kept thing but why why you know and and</text>
  <text start="2848.62" dur="2.64">and as if you just Satan just because</text>
  <text start="2850.57" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re so powerful</text>
  <text start="2851.26" dur="5.75">anyway so my grand eyes and I&amp;#39;ll go home</text>
  <text start="2854.62" dur="4.38">and I&amp;#39;m on my way home I realized</text>
  <text start="2857.01" dur="3.52">because she&amp;#39;s sitting you now you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2859" dur="3.99">come back until the everything&amp;#39;s kings</text>
  <text start="2860.53" dur="5.28">and sorta dark and I realized that this</text>
  <text start="2862.99" dur="6.21">was my opportunity and I went home</text>
  <text start="2865.81" dur="4.98">except in my lounge and it was I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2869.2" dur="3.78">want to open my mouth I didn&amp;#39;t even want</text>
  <text start="2870.79" dur="4.38">to speak because I so scared that the</text>
  <text start="2872.98" dur="3.42">moment I spoke the spiritual film or</text>
  <text start="2875.17" dur="3.48">something would happen the roof would</text>
  <text start="2876.4" dur="5.58">cave on and so I second the captioned</text>
  <text start="2878.65" dur="5.04">alarm and it was like oh what do I do</text>
  <text start="2881.98" dur="5.19">yeah through my head all the time and</text>
  <text start="2883.69" dur="6.9">out of that came jewel who used to live</text>
  <text start="2887.17" dur="5.13">in this commune with you she worked at a</text>
  <text start="2890.59" dur="5.58">nursery a couple of kilometers down the</text>
  <text start="2892.3" dur="12.21">road and so I thought let me go and see</text>
  <text start="2896.17" dur="13.32">her and so I walked were you afraid of</text>
  <text start="2904.51" dur="7.41">something happening in the car the</text>
  <text start="2909.49" dur="4.86">moment I opened my mouth and I made a</text>
  <text start="2911.92" dur="4.2">decision then all hell is going to come</text>
  <text start="2914.35" dur="5.7">against me okay okay</text>
  <text start="2916.12" dur="8.67">and so I went up to her and I think the</text>
  <text start="2920.05" dur="6.24">first thing I did was apologize and how</text>
  <text start="2924.79" dur="3.6">does the door I need help I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2926.29" dur="5.31">what to do I went out she looked at me</text>
  <text start="2928.39" dur="5.16">wide-eyed and and being a fairly new</text>
  <text start="2931.6" dur="3.87">Christian she just said I don&amp;#39;t know</text>

  <text start="2940.12" dur="5.01">and they said we&amp;#39;re gonna come over this</text>
  <text start="2943.36" dur="4.23">evening or after work we&amp;#39;ll come over</text>
  <text start="2945.13" dur="7.62">and we&amp;#39;ll checked you and I walked home</text>
  <text start="2947.59" dur="8.81">now like really scared and I I set down</text>
  <text start="2952.75" dur="3.65">in the couch in the lounge and</text>
  <text start="2957.369" dur="4.261">I&amp;#39;m up here in semester damn I&amp;#39;m out of</text>

  <text start="3249.99" dur="6.15">deliverance there was spiritual attacks</text>
  <text start="3252.66" dur="6.33">and and for about a year it was ongoing</text>

  <text start="3292.5" dur="6.12">weird dreams you know you know what my</text>
  <text start="3295.14" dur="6.15">my question was at first I was very</text>
  <text start="3298.62" dur="5.37">reluctant to go down any road involving</text>
  <text start="3301.29" dur="4.53">prophecy or spiritual healing or</text>
  <text start="3303.99" dur="4.77">anything like that I didn&amp;#39;t even want to</text>
  <text start="3305.82" dur="4.77">touch it because it was like how do i</text>
  <text start="3308.76" dur="4.77">define the link between what is what I</text>
  <text start="3310.59" dur="6.09">was in coming back and where I am now</text>
  <text start="3313.53" dur="5.13">and I didn&amp;#39;t even touch it oh yeah that</text>
  <text start="3316.68" dur="5.28">is very very common I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="3318.66" dur="5.76">people who have come out of food ISM and</text>
  <text start="3321.96" dur="5.67">you know meditation and the New Age and</text>
  <text start="3324.42" dur="6.03">they&amp;#39;re all very very reluctant to talk</text>
  <text start="3327.63" dur="6.42">about anything that is truly spiritual</text>
  <text start="3330.45" dur="7.08">like you know prophecy and things of</text>
  <text start="3334.05" dur="5.34">that nature spirit travel because they</text>
  <text start="3337.53" dur="4.71">get they have this conviction like maybe</text>
  <text start="3339.39" dur="6.15">it&amp;#39;s all bad and maybe that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="3342.24" dur="5.64">demonic and so I counseled those people</text>
  <text start="3345.54" dur="4.02">you know what that&amp;#39;s okay for a season</text>
  <text start="3347.88" dur="3.57">don&amp;#39;t pay any attention to that stuff</text>
  <text start="3349.56" dur="3.63">just get yourself grounded in the word</text>
  <text start="3351.45" dur="3.21">and get yourself a good strong</text>
  <text start="3353.19" dur="3.179">relationship with the Lord and if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3354.66" dur="3.78">sometime in the future</text>
  <text start="3356.369" dur="4.68">he starts to introduce you back to that</text>
  <text start="3358.44" dur="4.98">stuff to his version of it then you know</text>
  <text start="3361.049" dur="4.351">be willing and be open to it but for a</text>
  <text start="3363.42" dur="3.929">lot of people they have to walk away</text>
  <text start="3365.4" dur="4.02">from that completely for a while yeah</text>
  <text start="3367.349" dur="3.72">and that&amp;#39;s really all was III literally</text>
  <text start="3369.42" dur="3.99">just walked away from it I got involved</text>

  <text start="3390.329" dur="4.5">we&amp;#39;ve all been saved out of stuff we</text>
  <text start="3392.999" dur="3.81">yeah we were all amazed before we were</text>
  <text start="3394.829" dur="4.26">saved and we all came to the Lord for</text>
  <text start="3396.809" dur="5.161">our own selfish reasons whether it was</text>
  <text start="3399.089" dur="5.67">yeah the Lord rule make me prosper or</text>
  <text start="3401.97" dur="4.47">heal me or save me out of my sin or</text>

  <text start="3420.809" dur="6.601">I couldn&amp;#39;t understand was the Bible</text>
  <text start="3424.38" dur="6.179">clearly was you go and heal the sick and</text>
  <text start="3427.41" dur="5.359">you set the captives free and and here</text>
  <text start="3430.559" dur="4.921">is God who saved me from what</text>
  <text start="3432.769" dur="4.24">technically was the greatest spiritual</text>
  <text start="3435.48" dur="5.91">power and I put it in inverted commas</text>
  <text start="3437.009" dur="6.871">for listeners in Africa and yet we sit</text>
  <text start="3441.39" dur="6.179">in a church where most people are dead</text>
  <text start="3443.88" dur="5.699">and there&amp;#39;s no power whatsoever is there</text>
  <text start="3447.569" dur="3.601">is nothing it&amp;#39;s the sum total of</text>
  <text start="3449.579" dur="3.601">Christianity for most people is going to</text>
  <text start="3451.17" dur="4.53">church on a Sunday I just couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3453.18" dur="6.21">relate them to I really struggled and</text>
  <text start="3455.7" dur="5.819">then so this was in about 2006 or eight</text>
  <text start="3459.39" dur="4.169">years afterwards I started to ask</text>
  <text start="3461.519" dur="4.53">questions really Lord what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="3463.559" dur="4.44">here now I&amp;#39;ve got involved in a healing</text>
  <text start="3466.049" dur="3.48">movement I got involved in deliverance</text>
  <text start="3467.999" dur="2.79">ministry obviously because we all was</text>

  <text start="3481.499" dur="3.661">spiritually in that sense but I was</text>
  <text start="3482.94" dur="4.5">still going that God where is the stuff</text>
  <text start="3485.16" dur="4.48">that you really want to see and and the</text>

  <text start="3489.64" dur="3.689">kind of dream where I&amp;#39;m doing now</text>
  <text start="3490.93" dur="5.909">running camp programs and this is early</text>
  <text start="3493.329" dur="5.7">2009 and it was the first time I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3496.839" dur="4.621">heard the audible voice of God as</text>
  <text start="3499.029" dur="4.05">someone speaking to me and this voice</text>
  <text start="3501.46" dur="2.849">said to me out of the blue now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3503.079" dur="3.78">standing in front of a group of people</text>
  <text start="3504.309" dur="5.76">and I&amp;#39;m facilitating an activity on camp</text>
  <text start="3506.859" dur="5.76">and I hear this voice and it says Alan</text>

  <text start="3512.619" dur="8.311">places and I live in you why are you so</text>

  <text start="3523.21" dur="6.69">gone and I&amp;#39;ve never ever forgotten those</text>
  <text start="3526.989" dur="5.01">words and looking back I kept trying to</text>
  <text start="3529.9" dur="3.24">be some way and realizing that I was</text>
  <text start="3531.999" dur="3.24">never getting there because always</text>
  <text start="3533.14" dur="4.439">looked at myself and my own shortcomings</text>
  <text start="3535.239" dur="4.411">the mode failure my own sons and</text>
