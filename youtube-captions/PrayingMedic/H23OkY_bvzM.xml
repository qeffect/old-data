  <text start="171.459" dur="5.131">of the dance is learning to dialogue</text>
  <text start="173.5" dur="5.97">with them okay so you feel his heart</text>
  <text start="176.59" dur="4.65">when you feel like if it&amp;#39;s depression or</text>
  <text start="179.47" dur="2.88">something you respond back to him and</text>
  <text start="181.24" dur="2.82">you say is this have to do with</text>
  <text start="182.35" dur="3.87">someone&amp;#39;s depression and what will</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="4.08">happen is is he&amp;#39;ll come more with his</text>
  <text start="186.22" dur="4.32">power and he&amp;#39;ll start leading you and</text>
  <text start="188.14" dur="5.31">what will start happening is his if you</text>
  <text start="190.54" dur="5.1">hit it correctly his presence will</text>
  <text start="193.45" dur="3.6">intensify in your soul and you will</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="4.11">actually you know people use this</text>
  <text start="197.05" dur="4.59">analogy you step into a river or starts</text>
  <text start="199.75" dur="3.78">but you start becoming filled with the</text>
  <text start="201.64" dur="4.73">Holy Spirit when you hit where God wants</text>
  <text start="203.53" dur="5.22">you to go his presence manifests more</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="4.149">okay that means you&amp;#39;re joining him in</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="3.12">the dance now now I don&amp;#39;t know about you</text>
  <text start="210.519" dur="2.671">but the first couple years that I used</text>
  <text start="211.87" dur="3">to dance with the Lord he would come in</text>
  <text start="213.19" dur="5.13">and say alright now here&amp;#39;s an issue with</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="5.82">inner healing I would get so excited the</text>
  <text start="218.32" dur="4.5">guy would actually want to use me that I</text>
  <text start="220.69" dur="3.81">was the worst dance partner I was like a</text>
  <text start="222.82" dur="3.75">sack of potatoes he would invite me I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="3.54">grab his hand I get all excited and he&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="3.29">basically after turnaround just put me</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="4.29">right back down on the ground again</text>
  <text start="229.86" dur="3.52">because I couldn&amp;#39;t learn I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="232.33" dur="2.909">you guys have ever started with this if</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="5.55">I couldn&amp;#39;t learn to relax in God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="235.239" dur="5.161">presence and learn that now by the way</text>
  <text start="238.93" dur="3.51">this is important if you remember and</text>
  <text start="240.4" dur="5">Jesus said like all you that are weary</text>
  <text start="242.44" dur="4.29">and heavy-laden come and I will give you</text>
  <text start="245.4" dur="5.02">rest</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="8.3">how do you catch that theme he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="6.93">his presence is connected with rest and</text>
  <text start="255.03" dur="4.6">then he talks about being meek and lowly</text>
  <text start="257.35" dur="4.939">he&amp;#39;s trying to tell you the principle</text>
  <text start="259.63" dur="6.57">walking with the spirit when he comes</text>
  <text start="262.289" dur="4.85">turn-off trying to be emotional rest it</text>
  <text start="266.2" dur="2.83">before him just</text>
  <text start="267.139" dur="3.601">God okay I&amp;#39;m just gonna you know Jim</text>
  <text start="269.03" dur="4.52">talked about me being Andy Williams and</text>
  <text start="270.74" dur="5.22">all this other stuff that has taken me</text>
  <text start="273.55" dur="5.709">decades to try to develop that in my</text>
  <text start="275.96" dur="7.889">soul God doesn&amp;#39;t need me to add anything</text>
  <text start="279.259" dur="6.93">to his presence he needs me to rest in</text>
  <text start="283.849" dur="6.361">his presence so he can accomplish what</text>
  <text start="286.189" dur="6.06">he wants to do okay now I do not have a</text>
  <text start="290.21" dur="3.75">problem with people getting excited and</text>
  <text start="292.249" dur="3.72">moving and power and authority I</text>
  <text start="293.96" dur="4.429">understand that but I do not want to add</text>
  <text start="295.969" dur="5.431">to that when God is not adding to it</text>
  <text start="298.389" dur="5.5">okay because that stops the dance it</text>
  <text start="301.4" dur="4.59">stops what God wants to do at any point</text>
  <text start="303.889" dur="6.361">when you&amp;#39;re walking with God you can cut</text>
  <text start="305.99" dur="6.389">it off by you taking it over okay and so</text>
  <text start="310.25" dur="5.789">well thank you oh this guy is enjoying</text>
  <text start="312.379" dur="6.391">it okay so so I&amp;#39;m starting to pray for</text>
  <text start="316.039" dur="4.171">an individual I asked them because</text>
  <text start="318.77" dur="2.669">remember when you&amp;#39;re dancing and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="320.21" dur="3">about to do ministry to another</text>
  <text start="321.439" dur="3.391">individual you&amp;#39;re dialoguing with them</text>
  <text start="323.21" dur="3.929">at the same times do you feel this if</text>
  <text start="324.83" dur="4.109">they don&amp;#39;t you ask the Lord all right</text>
  <text start="327.139" dur="5.37">let&amp;#39;s engage and God will want to come</text>
  <text start="328.939" dur="6.301">and he wants to fill them with his</text>
  <text start="332.509" dur="4.861">presence nurture them cause his goodness</text>
  <text start="335.24" dur="4.169">to come over when I used to first start</text>
  <text start="337.37" dur="3.63">doing ministry I tried to do it as fast</text>
  <text start="339.409" dur="4.641">as I could you guys ever do that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="341" dur="6.33">like okay now I think that God came and</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="7.419">we had like thoughts of the anointing</text>
  <text start="347.33" dur="5.819">and because we were all so full of sin</text>
  <text start="351.469" dur="3.391">and we leaked and all these other terms</text>
  <text start="353.149" dur="3.42">that everybody used I thought we only</text>
  <text start="354.86" dur="3.989">have about 30 seconds so we had to go as</text>
  <text start="356.569" dur="4.111">fast as we could we had a scream and we</text>
  <text start="358.849" dur="3.74">kind of had a slap people right I mean</text>
  <text start="360.68" dur="4.859">just kind of make it work</text>
  <text start="362.589" dur="5.92">all right you&amp;#39;re missing something if</text>
  <text start="365.539" dur="6.09">you think that&amp;#39;s how God is God comes in</text>
  <text start="368.509" dur="5.37">an invitation you participate with what</text>
  <text start="371.629" dur="3.54">he&amp;#39;s doing right there if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="373.879" dur="3.09">accomplished what he wants to have</text>
  <text start="375.169" dur="3.24">accomplished he&amp;#39;ll actually come as</text>
  <text start="376.969" dur="3.66">people calls it waves it&amp;#39;ll actually</text>
  <text start="378.409" dur="4.41">come and another wave and it will go</text>
  <text start="380.629" dur="5.28">deeper and I&amp;#39;ll actually have more power</text>
  <text start="382.819" dur="5.88">if you learn to stay with it so when</text>
  <text start="385.909" dur="5.16">someone is learning to recognize the</text>
  <text start="388.699" dur="4.381">Lord think of this a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="391.069" dur="3.72">have not been trained on the knowledge</text>
  <text start="393.08" dur="4.5">of experiencing God and so your goal</text>
  <text start="394.789" dur="5.61">with God first if I can use this analogy</text>
  <text start="397.58" dur="3.78">is to take a stick of butter out of the</text>
  <text start="400.399" dur="2.79">freezer</text>
  <text start="401.36" dur="5.64">put it on a plate and stick it in the</text>
  <text start="403.189" dur="6.361">microwave for 30 seconds okay you invite</text>
  <text start="407" dur="4.56">God&amp;#39;s presence and then you let him</text>
  <text start="409.55" dur="5.1">dance with a person for a moment until</text>
  <text start="411.56" dur="6.78">he tells you it&amp;#39;s your turn again okay</text>
  <text start="414.65" dur="6.12">now you guys realize that physically we</text>
  <text start="418.34" dur="3.78">cannot see the Holy Spirit ministering</text>
  <text start="420.77" dur="3.54">to people and that&amp;#39;s why I use the stick</text>
  <text start="422.12" dur="4.68">of butter in the microwave but we know</text>
  <text start="424.31" dur="4.05">that God is and so we have to take him</text>
  <text start="426.8" dur="3.299">at his word and the way that we</text>
  <text start="428.36" dur="3.359">recognize it is by talking to the other</text>
  <text start="430.099" dur="3.481">person do you feel anything do you sense</text>
  <text start="431.719" dur="3.331">anything now most people when they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="433.58" dur="3.51">first trying to come into this idea of</text>
  <text start="435.05" dur="4.26">got dancing or his presence coming most</text>
  <text start="437.09" dur="4.319">people just say oh I feel peace now for</text>
  <text start="439.31" dur="3.509">years I couldn&amp;#39;t recognize what that was</text>
  <text start="441.409" dur="2.97">but that&amp;#39;s actually another indication</text>
  <text start="442.819" dur="3.63">that God is just about to change the</text>
  <text start="444.379" dur="3.75">dance move when they feel God&amp;#39;s peace</text>
  <text start="446.449" dur="2.821">it&amp;#39;s time for you to engage with God</text>
  <text start="448.129" dur="5.25">again and go now where are you going</text>
  <text start="449.27" dur="7.53">here alright and so God will pick the</text>
  <text start="453.379" dur="5.4">agenda he&amp;#39;ll just start look I want to</text>
  <text start="456.8" dur="3.329">take this person through healing and I</text>
  <text start="458.779" dur="2.88">want you to cooperate with me</text>
  <text start="460.129" dur="3.361">he&amp;#39;s not asking you to remember some</text>
  <text start="461.659" dur="3.63">formula of healing all he&amp;#39;s asking you</text>
  <text start="463.49" dur="5.7">to do is to say the thing that he wants</text>
  <text start="465.289" dur="5.521">said dude he wants you to a lot of times</text>
  <text start="469.19" dur="4.14">when I pray with people it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="470.81" dur="4.56">interesting to me God usually just gives</text>
  <text start="473.33" dur="4.44">me one word in the dance he says just</text>
  <text start="475.37" dur="3.63">say this to him I say you know that</text>
  <text start="477.77" dur="3.119">thing that happened to you in the past</text>
  <text start="479" dur="4.77">God is not going to define you by that</text>
  <text start="480.889" dur="5.37">and then God takes over the dance fills</text>
  <text start="483.77" dur="4.47">that person with healing and love and</text>
  <text start="486.259" dur="3.75">all he wants me to do is just sit back</text>
  <text start="488.24" dur="3.419">and wait until he gives me another</text>
  <text start="490.009" dur="6.931">invitation with his presence and says</text>
  <text start="491.659" dur="7.41">now follow me in this okay all right so</text>
  <text start="496.94" dur="3.96">I learned to dialogue with God in fact</text>
  <text start="499.069" dur="3.9">the way that the flowing in the spirit</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="4.019">is this concept of continual</text>
  <text start="502.969" dur="4.711">relationship dynamic I talked to him I</text>
  <text start="504.919" dur="5.28">fellowship with him I worship Him as he</text>
  <text start="507.68" dur="4.109">is ministering to people I wait for an</text>
  <text start="510.199" dur="3">effect now I don&amp;#39;t know if you guys have</text>
  <text start="511.789" dur="3.99">had someone talk to you about this idea</text>
  <text start="513.199" dur="5.97">but a lot of us do ministry without</text>
  <text start="515.779" dur="6.541">watching the Holy Spirit minister God</text>
  <text start="519.169" dur="7.17">wants us to learn to wait for an effect</text>
  <text start="522.32" dur="5.55">which means something is going to happen</text>
  <text start="526.339" dur="4.711">to the person when you&amp;#39;re praying to him</text>
  <text start="527.87" dur="6.24">alright when you let God do the full</text>
  <text start="531.05" dur="3.52">work that he wants to do until you move</text>
  <text start="534.11" dur="1.63">on</text>
  <text start="534.57" dur="3.72">to the next thing that God is directing</text>
  <text start="535.74" dur="5.3">you to okay so that that actually means</text>
  <text start="538.29" dur="7.11">that time now especially in our culture</text>
  <text start="541.04" dur="6.79">time is has God&amp;#39;s lordship over it when</text>
  <text start="545.4" dur="4.47">it comes to ministry some people he does</text>
  <text start="547.83" dur="3.93">it in two minutes some people he takes</text>
  <text start="549.87" dur="7.11">45 minutes some people he takes nine</text>
  <text start="551.76" dur="6.75">months why does he do it that way for</text>
  <text start="556.98" dur="3.96">years I used to just sit back and go</text>
