  <text start="11.79" dur="4.91">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="2.601">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="29.37" dur="5.68">hi I&amp;#39;d like to welcome you to our show</text>
  <text start="31.48" dur="5.52">I&amp;#39;m your host brain medic we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="35.05" dur="3.99">about life as a child of God and all</text>
  <text start="37" dur="4.53">things related to his kingdom thanks for</text>
  <text start="39.04" dur="2.97">joining us if you&amp;#39;re a new listener to</text>
  <text start="41.53" dur="2.01">the show</text>
  <text start="42.01" dur="7.16">you can find articles and books and</text>
  <text start="43.54" dur="5.63">other resources on my website WWE</text>
  <text start="60.989" dur="4.151">champions message was recorded in</text>
  <text start="63.25" dur="4.02">several different sessions using my</text>
  <text start="65.14" dur="4.589">phone while I was on duty between calls</text>
  <text start="67.27" dur="4.709">so you&amp;#39;ll notice some inconsistency in</text>
  <text start="69.729" dur="4.561">the audio quality which I apologize for</text>
  <text start="71.979" dur="3.811">in advance I&amp;#39;ve been getting inquiries</text>
  <text start="74.29" dur="3.78">from people who want to learn about</text>
  <text start="75.79" dur="5.43">healing and one of the things I want to</text>
  <text start="78.07" dur="6.299">address is the fact that there are many</text>
  <text start="81.22" dur="5.94">people who come to me and ask if I will</text>
  <text start="84.369" dur="4.591">train them or mentor them in healing</text>
  <text start="87.16" dur="5.25">because they have someone in their</text>
  <text start="88.96" dur="4.92">family who has fallen sick or was born</text>
  <text start="92.41" dur="3.599">with some kind of condition and they</text>
  <text start="93.88" dur="4.5">want to get this person healed I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="96.009" dur="5.371">mean to be insensitive about this</text>
  <text start="98.38" dur="5.64">situation because if anyone understands</text>
  <text start="101.38" dur="3.989">how badly you can desire to see a family</text>
  <text start="104.02" dur="4.62">member healed it&amp;#39;s me</text>
  <text start="105.369" dur="5.761">my wife has suffered from many different</text>
  <text start="108.64" dur="3.119">conditions over the years and just like</text>
  <text start="111.13" dur="2.489">anyone else</text>
  <text start="111.759" dur="4.53">I desperately wanted to see her healed</text>
  <text start="113.619" dur="5.25">of all of her afflictions and conditions</text>
  <text start="116.289" dur="4.56">so I understand where people are coming</text>
  <text start="118.869" dur="3.901">from when they say they want to learn</text>
  <text start="120.849" dur="4.47">how to heal because they have a family</text>
  <text start="122.77" dur="5.37">member that really needs it but I do</text>
  <text start="125.319" dur="5.431">want to say this healing is not really</text>
  <text start="128.14" dur="5.1">something that you learn because you</text>
  <text start="130.75" dur="5.88">want to take care of one situation it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="133.24" dur="4.77">a bit like having a burglar come into</text>
  <text start="136.63" dur="4.11">your house and say your house has been</text>
  <text start="138.01" dur="5.22">burglarized two or three times in the</text>
  <text start="140.74" dur="4.71">last year and you go to the police</text>
  <text start="143.23" dur="3.66">department and say look I want to take a</text>
  <text start="145.45" dur="3.42">police training I want to go to police</text>
  <text start="146.89" dur="3.46">academy and I want to learn to become a</text>
  <text start="148.87" dur="3.07">police officer because</text>
  <text start="150.35" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;m sick of this burglar coming and</text>
  <text start="151.94" dur="4.71">burglarizing my houses so you don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="154.49" dur="4.26">to police academy and go through police</text>
  <text start="156.65" dur="4.26">training in order to take care of a</text>
  <text start="158.75" dur="4.44">burglar who has been burglarizing your</text>
  <text start="160.91" dur="4.47">house if you have a burglar who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="163.19" dur="4.11">burglarizing your house you might want</text>
  <text start="165.38" dur="3.42">to install an alarm system you might</text>
  <text start="167.3" dur="4.47">want to install some kind of security</text>
  <text start="168.8" dur="4.86">system in order to deal with a specific</text>
  <text start="171.77" dur="3.6">situation in your life you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="173.66" dur="3.93">actually need to go through law</text>
  <text start="175.37" dur="5.01">enforcement Academy and become trained</text>
  <text start="177.59" dur="5.04">as a cop you become trained as a police</text>
  <text start="180.38" dur="5.16">officer if you feel it is your calling</text>
  <text start="182.63" dur="4.59">in life to combat crime that is the</text>
  <text start="185.54" dur="4.32">reason why people go to law enforcement</text>
  <text start="187.22" dur="5.13">academy they&amp;#39;ve decided that they are</text>
  <text start="189.86" dur="4.26">not going to tolerate crime and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="192.35" dur="3.96">gonna do whatever they can to try to</text>
  <text start="194.12" dur="4.74">apprehend criminals to enforce the law</text>
  <text start="196.31" dur="6.09">to keep criminal behavior under control</text>
  <text start="198.86" dur="3.99">and in a sense when people learn about</text>
  <text start="202.4" dur="2.37">healing</text>
  <text start="202.85" dur="4.23">that&amp;#39;s essentially what they are we</text>
  <text start="204.77" dur="4.35">don&amp;#39;t learn to heal the sick because we</text>
  <text start="207.08" dur="4.5">want to take care of one situation in</text>
  <text start="209.12" dur="5.07">their life we learn to heal the sick</text>
  <text start="211.58" dur="4.5">because we believe it is our divine</text>
  <text start="214.19" dur="4.74">calling to combat the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="216.08" dur="5.79">darkness because here&amp;#39;s the truth</text>
  <text start="218.93" dur="6.06">learning how to heal the sick is a very</text>
  <text start="221.87" dur="5.76">long process in a sense it&amp;#39;s a short</text>
  <text start="224.99" dur="4.95">process because once you learn what</text>
  <text start="227.63" dur="3.6">faith is and how it operates and what</text>
  <text start="229.94" dur="2.1">your authority is and you learn how to</text>
  <text start="231.23" dur="3.63">exercise it</text>
  <text start="232.04" dur="5.7">you can fairly quickly see people healed</text>
  <text start="234.86" dur="4.86">but in another sense the supernatural</text>
  <text start="237.74" dur="4.14">ministry of healing deliverance and all</text>
  <text start="239.72" dur="4.77">the things go with it can be a very long</text>
  <text start="241.88" dur="3.72">course of training in fact it&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="244.49" dur="2.01">you the rest of your life to learn</text>
  <text start="245.6" dur="3.09">everything there is to know about</text>
  <text start="246.5" dur="3.93">healing it really needs to become a</text>
  <text start="248.69" dur="4.29">lifestyle and it needs to become</text>
  <text start="250.43" dur="4.29">something that you do not because you</text>
  <text start="252.98" dur="3.629">have one person in your life who needs</text>
  <text start="254.72" dur="4.829">to be healed but because you firmly</text>
  <text start="256.609" dur="5.371">believe that it is your job your destiny</text>
  <text start="259.549" dur="4.981">and your calling to be trained and</text>
  <text start="261.98" dur="3.99">equipped as a person who every chance</text>
  <text start="264.53" dur="3.87">they get destroys the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="265.97" dur="4.41">darkness I think we need to have a</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="4.8">greater understanding of what our</text>
  <text start="270.38" dur="6.15">purpose is in life what a divine destiny</text>
  <text start="273.2" dur="6.12">is if you are a disciple of Jesus you</text>
  <text start="276.53" dur="5.13">have been commissioned by him to heal</text>
  <text start="279.32" dur="4.15">the sick cast out demons and raise the</text>
  <text start="281.66" dur="4.63">dead and proclaim the kingdom</text>
  <text start="283.47" dur="4.62">all of us are called to do that or we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="286.29" dur="3.93">all been given Authority we&amp;#39;ve all been</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="5.13">given power to do that and doing that</text>
  <text start="290.22" dur="5.55">really needs to become a life long task</text>
  <text start="293.22" dur="5.34">that we take up we need to continually</text>
  <text start="295.77" dur="5.67">be learning more about God&amp;#39;s ways more</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="5.49">about how to release his power and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="301.44" dur="4.89">not something you can do in a week or a</text>
  <text start="304.05" dur="3.54">month you can learn the basics of</text>
  <text start="306.33" dur="2.52">healing in a month or two if you just</text>
  <text start="307.59" dur="3.33">want to take care of somebody who&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="308.85" dur="4.38">an illness but what&amp;#39;s gonna happen if</text>
  <text start="310.92" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s your desire is after you get this</text>
  <text start="313.23" dur="3.36">person healed you&amp;#39;re gonna forget about</text>
  <text start="314.91" dur="4.83">healing you&amp;#39;ll forget about miracles you</text>
  <text start="316.59" dur="5.4">forget about deliverance you will go on</text>
  <text start="319.74" dur="4.2">about your life and find other things to</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="3.96">occupy your time with the problem with</text>
  <text start="323.94" dur="4.86">that is and it&amp;#39;s a little bit selfish on</text>
  <text start="325.95" dur="5.31">my part but I can&amp;#39;t really afford to</text>
  <text start="328.8" dur="3.99">invest my time and my resources and my</text>
  <text start="331.26" dur="3.18">energy in training and equipping</text>
  <text start="332.79" dur="3.93">somebody who just wants to get one</text>
  <text start="334.44" dur="4.77">person healed it&amp;#39;s my calling to train</text>
  <text start="336.72" dur="4.38">and equip Saints who want to go out and</text>
  <text start="339.21" dur="4.53">advance a kingdom and they want to live</text>
  <text start="341.1" dur="4.319">as mature sons and daughters of God who</text>
  <text start="343.74" dur="4.17">are destroying the kingdom of darkness</text>
  <text start="345.419" dur="3.811">every opportunity there are people who</text>
  <text start="347.91" dur="3.39">are willing to invest the time and</text>
  <text start="349.23" dur="3.63">energy and learn about the ways of the</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="4.08">Holy Spirit they have realized that it</text>
  <text start="352.86" dur="4.89">is their calling to set captives free</text>
  <text start="355.38" dur="3.96">and if you&amp;#39;re not willing to become one</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="3.57">of those people you&amp;#39;re probably best off</text>
  <text start="359.34" dur="3.84">just taking your sick family member to</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="3.93">those people and letting them do the</text>
  <text start="363.18" dur="4.47">work there really isn&amp;#39;t any point in</text>
  <text start="365.25" dur="4.83">learning about healing just get one</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="4.71">person healed there&amp;#39;s so much to learn</text>
  <text start="370.08" dur="3.899">there&amp;#39;s so many different obstacles to</text>
  <text start="372.36" dur="3.21">healing and hindrances and things that</text>
  <text start="373.979" dur="3.241">have to be removed and things that have</text>
  <text start="375.57" dur="4.2">to be changed it&amp;#39;s practically</text>
  <text start="377.22" dur="4.14">impossible to learn everything there is</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="2.97">to know about healing in the short</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="3.15">period of time that you&amp;#39;re going to want</text>
  <text start="382.74" dur="3.54">to put into this in order to get one</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="3.57">person healed of some stubborn disease</text>
  <text start="386.28" dur="3.81">it&amp;#39;s not something you can do just</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="5.37">because you have one person who wants to</text>
  <text start="390.09" dur="5.85">be healed once you start to pursue</text>
  <text start="393.45" dur="3.84">healing and once you start to pursue</text>
  <text start="395.94" dur="3.21">deliverance and you start trying to get</text>
  <text start="397.29" dur="3.18">people healed and set free of demons and</text>
  <text start="399.15" dur="2.82">I kind of put healing and deliverance</text>
  <text start="400.47" dur="3.03">together because you&amp;#39;re not going to get</text>
  <text start="401.97" dur="3.24">very many people healed if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="4.2">develop some decent understanding about</text>
  <text start="405.21" dur="4.709">how spirits operate you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="407.7" dur="4.38">get rid of demons if you&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="409.919" dur="4.831">very many people healed a lot of people</text>
  <text start="412.08" dur="5.13">don&amp;#39;t really suffer much in the way of</text>
  <text start="414.75" dur="4.83">demonic attack until they start to</text>
  <text start="417.21" dur="4.62">operate in healing and deliverance and</text>
  <text start="419.58" dur="4.56">when you start to kick demons out of</text>
  <text start="421.83" dur="4.05">people and make demons homeless and when</text>
  <text start="424.14" dur="4.2">you start getting people healed and set</text>
  <text start="425.88" dur="5.01">free the king of Darkness doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="4.41">actually like us doing that so what</text>
  <text start="430.89" dur="3.75">happens is you start to suffer demonic</text>
  <text start="432.75" dur="3.75">attacks yourself you might run into a</text>
  <text start="434.64" dur="3.54">paralyzing spirit that is going to jump</text>
  <text start="436.5" dur="3.99">you and paralyze you in the middle of</text>
  <text start="438.18" dur="4.049">the night you will start developing</text>
  <text start="440.49" dur="3.48">strange aches and pains that you never</text>
  <text start="442.229" dur="3.781">had before you&amp;#39;ll start developing all</text>
  <text start="443.97" dur="4.05">kinds of weird illnesses you&amp;#39;ll suffer</text>
  <text start="446.01" dur="3.39">demonic oppression you are going to come</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="1.769">under attack from the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="449.4" dur="3.21">darkness</text>
  <text start="449.789" dur="5.551">I guarantee it no one is immune to it it</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="4.95">does seem to increase once you start to</text>
  <text start="455.34" dur="5.25">push back against the enemy and you have</text>
  <text start="457.56" dur="5.669">to realize we are in war all of us are</text>
  <text start="460.59" dur="4.35">in a war we live in a battle zone and</text>
  <text start="463.229" dur="4.831">the reason why people are sick and dying</text>
  <text start="464.94" dur="5.19">is because Christians are not standing</text>
  <text start="468.06" dur="4.05">up taking up their weapons learning how</text>
  <text start="470.13" dur="3.99">to use them and be trained and fighting</text>
  <text start="472.11" dur="3.989">back against the enemy so once you</text>
  <text start="474.12" dur="3.12">actually learn about the spiritual</text>
  <text start="476.099" dur="2.82">weapons and once you learn how to use</text>
  <text start="477.24" dur="4.08">them and start fighting back against the</text>
  <text start="478.919" dur="4.321">enemy the enemy puts a big old target on</text>
  <text start="481.32" dur="3.15">your back and says oh well you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="483.24" dur="1.95">fight back we&amp;#39;re gonna make a little</text>
  <text start="484.47" dur="2.94">harder for you</text>
  <text start="485.19" dur="4.77">spiritual warfare is part and parcel</text>
  <text start="487.41" dur="4.62">with healing and deliverance there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="489.96" dur="5.25">way you&amp;#39;re gonna avoid it and this is</text>
  <text start="492.03" dur="5.639">why it&amp;#39;s really not an option to make</text>
  <text start="495.21" dur="4.5">this a lifestyle because it&amp;#39;s you start</text>
  <text start="497.669" dur="3.18">to get people healed even if you only</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="3">think you&amp;#39;re gonna get one or two people</text>
  <text start="500.849" dur="3.661">healed when you start to operate in the</text>
  <text start="502.71" dur="3.78">supernatural the enemy is going to push</text>
  <text start="504.51" dur="3.99">back against what you&amp;#39;re doing and is</text>
  <text start="506.49" dur="4.23">gonna try to discourage you and attack</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="3.539">you you may not like that but you can</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="3.119">just be another person coasting along</text>
  <text start="512.039" dur="3.3">through life making no impact against</text>
  <text start="513.839" dur="3.541">the kingdom of darkness quite frankly</text>
  <text start="515.339" dur="2.911">the enemy really likes that the enemy</text>
  <text start="517.38" dur="3.18">really likes</text>
  <text start="518.25" dur="3.99">Christians who are not interested in</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="3.57">healing or not interested in deliverance</text>
  <text start="522.24" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t really care about picking a fight</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="4.35">because the kingdom of darkness is</text>
  <text start="526.53" dur="4.17">advanced further and further when</text>
  <text start="528.48" dur="4.62">Christians do nothing there&amp;#39;s an old</text>
  <text start="530.7" dur="3.9">saying all that is required for evil men</text>
  <text start="533.1" dur="3.84">to succeed is for good men to do nothing</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="5.22">and when Christians sit on their butts</text>
  <text start="536.94" dur="5.91">and do nothing and refuse to get trained</text>
  <text start="539.82" dur="5.58">and equipped in spiritual warfare that</text>
  <text start="542.85" dur="4.32">is why we have hospitals full of sick</text>
  <text start="545.4" dur="4.17">people graveyards full of dead people</text>
  <text start="547.17" dur="2.78">who die prematurely and why the enemies</text>
  <text start="549.57" dur="2.45">make</text>
  <text start="549.95" dur="3.36">a general mess of the earth it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="552.02" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re not doing what we were</text>
  <text start="553.31" dur="5.61">commissioned to do again it&amp;#39;s my strong</text>
  <text start="556.1" dur="4.71">encouragement to every believer to take</text>
  <text start="558.92" dur="4.23">this stuff seriously this is not</text>
  <text start="560.81" dur="4.17">something you learn for a few weeks or</text>

  <text start="636.17" dur="4.05">started learning how to heal the sick</text>
  <text start="637.82" dur="4.41">but the time to learn is now and the</text>
  <text start="640.22" dur="3.6">time to exercise it is every single day</text>
  <text start="642.23" dur="3.57">of your life this is not something you</text>
  <text start="643.82" dur="3.63">do once in awhile it&amp;#39;s not something you</text>

  <text start="661.49" dur="6.72">terminal disease it is warfare you are a</text>
  <text start="665.03" dur="5.16">soldier and you are either going to be a</text>
  <text start="668.21" dur="3.81">soldier who picks up his weapons and</text>
  <text start="670.19" dur="3.08">fights or you&amp;#39;re gonna be a soldier</text>
  <text start="672.02" dur="3.93">sitting in an enemy prison camp</text>
  <text start="673.27" dur="4.63">ultimately we&amp;#39;re all being conformed</text>
  <text start="675.95" dur="4.11">into the image of Jesus and if we are</text>
  <text start="677.9" dur="4.679">all being conformed into the image of</text>
