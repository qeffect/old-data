  <text start="593.68" dur="5.099">you know for what it&amp;#39;s worth it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="597.19" dur="3.39">all speculation but it is interesting</text>
  <text start="598.779" dur="2.25">that he tweeted out a chess board last</text>
  <text start="600.58" dur="8.43">night</text>
  <text start="601.029" dur="12.481">now the FISA 702 is scheduled to go the</text>
  <text start="609.01" dur="8.699">702 Act expires January 19th it has to</text>
  <text start="613.51" dur="8.519">be renewed or it sunsets the House</text>
  <text start="617.709" dur="6.721">passed a reauthorization of the 702 it</text>
  <text start="622.029" dur="5.581">is going to the Senate next week for a</text>
  <text start="624.43" dur="7.08">vote it will probably pass Rand Paul has</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="5.91">threatened to filibuster the vote but he</text>
  <text start="631.51" dur="3.99">kind of positioned himself from what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="633.52" dur="4.86">understanding from Chad per gram our guy</text>
  <text start="635.5" dur="6.24">on Capitol Hill Rand Paul kind of</text>
  <text start="638.38" dur="6.38">screwed things up and he didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="641.74" dur="5.969">himself in the right position</text>
  <text start="644.76" dur="5.86">from a procedural standpoint to actually</text>
  <text start="647.709" dur="8.061">do a filibuster and so it&amp;#39;s looking like</text>
  <text start="650.62" dur="8.24">the FISA 702 will be reauthorized now</text>
  <text start="655.77" dur="6.04">some of us are concerned about that</text>
  <text start="658.86" dur="6.46">debby Nunez said he has seen abuse of</text>
  <text start="661.81" dur="5.43">the 702 not against foreign citizens but</text>
  <text start="665.32" dur="2.97">against American citizens and he says</text>
  <text start="667.24" dur="3.3">he&amp;#39;s going to share</text>
  <text start="668.29" dur="3.69">the evidence that he is uncovered with</text>
  <text start="670.54" dur="4.409">the entire House of Representatives</text>
  <text start="671.98" dur="5.729">later this month after they&amp;#39;ve got this</text>
  <text start="674.949" dur="13.281">thing reauthorized Nunez is actually</text>
  <text start="677.709" dur="14.041">supporting reauthorization of the 702 so</text>
  <text start="688.23" dur="6.46">what I&amp;#39;ve what I&amp;#39;m my position on this</text>
  <text start="691.75" dur="5.339">whole thing right right now is the</text>
  <text start="694.69" dur="4.5">president is in support of this the</text>
  <text start="697.089" dur="5.25">president feels he has taken the</text>
  <text start="699.19" dur="7.41">necessary steps to protect American</text>
  <text start="702.339" dur="6.841">citizens from illegal spying due to the</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="5.28">702 program it has been abused and and</text>
  <text start="709.18" dur="4.29">we do not understand how badly it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="711.88" dur="4.79">abused and that is about to come out</text>
  <text start="713.47" dur="7.679">I&amp;#39;ll talk about that in a minute but</text>
  <text start="716.67" dur="8.649">Trump signed that presidential directive</text>
  <text start="721.149" dur="7.8">to his his Director of National</text>

  <text start="735.85" dur="4.349">for intelligence on US citizens that is</text>
  <text start="738.279" dur="4.531">one safeguard he&amp;#39;s put in place the</text>
  <text start="740.199" dur="9.181">other safeguard is they have done away</text>
  <text start="742.81" dur="8.88">with the FISA 702 about queries now</text>
  <text start="749.38" dur="4.019">people have been asking me what this is</text>
  <text start="751.69" dur="4.32">all about them you know we talked about</text>
  <text start="753.399" dur="4.321">FISA and 702 and the about queries and</text>
  <text start="756.01" dur="5.49">the number 17 what is that all about</text>
  <text start="757.72" dur="6.989">all right so Sundance from conservative</text>
  <text start="761.5" dur="6">tree house posted a very helpful article</text>
  <text start="764.709" dur="4.471">last night that explains all of that</text>
  <text start="767.5" dur="4.86">jargon all the numbers and what it all</text>
  <text start="769.18" dur="6.87">means it&amp;#39;s very helpful I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="772.36" dur="5.55">what what I learned so fiza&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="776.05" dur="3.269">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</text>
  <text start="777.91" dur="7.14">it&amp;#39;s the congressional Act that</text>
  <text start="779.319" dur="11.971">authorizes the NSA database to be used</text>
  <text start="785.05" dur="9.269">to do surveillance on citizens 702 is an</text>
  <text start="791.29" dur="4.59">American caught up in the process of</text>
  <text start="794.319" dur="7.141">foreign surveillance that sort of 702</text>
  <text start="795.88" dur="9.46">means now we&amp;#39;ve talked about 16 and 17</text>
  <text start="801.46" dur="8.05">sixteen is a search query where you</text>
  <text start="805.34" dur="8.39">enter a like a name into the database</text>
  <text start="809.51" dur="8.4">into the NSA database and it is a to and</text>
  <text start="813.73" dur="9.43">from entry so if you put in a name like</text>
  <text start="817.91" dur="9.42">John Smith and you use a number 16 entry</text>
  <text start="823.16" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s only gonna return messages where</text>
  <text start="827.33" dur="6.75">John Smith is in the to or the from</text>
  <text start="829.67" dur="8.76">field that&amp;#39;s a number 16 query to and</text>
  <text start="834.08" dur="6.45">from okay so obviously if you are using</text>
  <text start="838.43" dur="4.92">if you&amp;#39;re accessing the FISA database</text>
  <text start="840.53" dur="5.19">and you&amp;#39;re only looking for</text>
  <text start="843.35" dur="4.29">correspondence with a - or a from field</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="9.06">it&amp;#39;s going to return a fairly small</text>
  <text start="847.64" dur="11.16">number of hits on that query number 17</text>
  <text start="854.78" dur="7.35">is the about query instead of having</text>
  <text start="858.8" dur="6.69">messages to it where it&amp;#39;s just - or from</text>
  <text start="862.13" dur="5.61">that name and about is you just put in</text>
  <text start="865.49" dur="3.87">anything that mentions this person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="867.74" dur="3.83">name it&amp;#39;s about is there any</text>
  <text start="869.36" dur="8.27">correspondence emails text messages</text>
  <text start="871.57" dur="6.06">about this person that returns a large</text>
  <text start="879.7" dur="9.37">string of data where anytime that name</text>
  <text start="883.91" dur="7.53">comes up whether it is you know casual</text>
  <text start="889.07" dur="4.68">conversations this person was at a bar</text>
  <text start="891.44" dur="5.58">someone wrote a book about this person</text>
  <text start="893.75" dur="6.84">there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s if you just enter the</text>
  <text start="897.02" dur="6.39">string about this person it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="900.59" dur="5.03">give you a massive data return lots and</text>
  <text start="903.41" dur="5.34">lots of information you can sift through</text>
  <text start="905.62" dur="6.43">you know two people talking about this</text>
  <text start="908.75" dur="5.61">person going to the store an email where</text>
  <text start="912.05" dur="2.67">this person&amp;#39;s name is mentioned anything</text>
  <text start="914.36" dur="2.73">like that</text>
  <text start="914.72" dur="5.55">it all comes up that&amp;#39;s the about query</text>
  <text start="917.09" dur="5.91">and that&amp;#39;s number 17 that is the query</text>
  <text start="920.27" dur="5.34">that has been abused in the past and</text>
  <text start="923" dur="5.19">that is the one that Admiral Rogers shut</text>
  <text start="925.61" dur="6.15">down when he was doing his compliance</text>
  <text start="928.19" dur="5.61">investigation over the the abuse of the</text>
  <text start="931.76" dur="2.93">database he found out that the about</text>
  <text start="933.8" dur="2.42">queries were</text>
  <text start="934.69" dur="3.69">being abused and he shut it down</text>
  <text start="936.22" dur="9.72">permanently and there they have not been</text>
  <text start="938.38" dur="10.83">able to use that since then so that that</text>
  <text start="945.94" dur="5.01">has been addressed and that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="949.21" dur="4.47">unlikely that that will be abused in the</text>
  <text start="950.95" dur="4.59">future so that&amp;#39;s part those are part of</text>
  <text start="953.68" dur="3.48">the safeguards that the president has</text>
  <text start="955.54" dur="4.74">talked about he said look you know we</text>
  <text start="957.16" dur="8.4">need this information we need to be able</text>
  <text start="960.28" dur="9.72">to access it and so it looks like the</text>
  <text start="965.56" dur="6.15">FISA 702 will be accessed and let me</text>
  <text start="970" dur="4.55">just give a little bit more explanation</text>
  <text start="971.71" dur="5.82">on this because people are curious so I</text>
  <text start="974.55" dur="4.51">did a threat on Twitter yesterday and if</text>
  <text start="977.53" dur="4.47">you want to go look at it you can read</text>
  <text start="979.06" dur="7.08">through it where I explained how the</text>
  <text start="982" dur="7.77">FISA database is accessed and I</text>
  <text start="986.14" dur="8.64">basically explained that how you do a</text>
  <text start="989.77" dur="8.4">search using the FISA database which is</text>
  <text start="994.78" dur="6.57">provided to the FBI and the DOJ by the</text>
  <text start="998.17" dur="6.57">National Security Agency is dependent</text>
  <text start="1001.35" dur="4.92">upon what agency you work for the type</text>
  <text start="1004.74" dur="5.4">of investigation you&amp;#39;re doing and the</text>
  <text start="1006.27" dur="11.01">type of person you are investigating so</text>
  <text start="1010.14" dur="12.57">essentially if you are investigating and</text>
  <text start="1017.28" dur="8.49">a criminal a criminal it&amp;#39;s a criminal</text>
  <text start="1022.71" dur="6.57">investigation on a US citizen who</text>
  <text start="1025.77" dur="7.35">committed bank fraud for example you</text>
  <text start="1029.28" dur="6.09">cannot access the database unless you</text>
  <text start="1033.12" dur="4.89">get a warrant from a judge you have to</text>
  <text start="1035.37" dur="4.53">show probable cause you have to fill out</text>
  <text start="1038.01" dur="4.17">an affidavit go to a court get a judge</text>
  <text start="1039.9" dur="3.66">to sign a warrant and then you can</text>
  <text start="1042.18" dur="3.63">access the database to get information</text>
  <text start="1043.56" dur="5.33">on that person because they&amp;#39;re a US</text>
  <text start="1045.81" dur="7.52">citizen and they&amp;#39;re protected from</text>
  <text start="1048.89" dur="8.29">unreasonable search and seizure now if</text>
  <text start="1053.33" dur="11.41">you are that&amp;#39;s a criminal investigation</text>
  <text start="1057.18" dur="10.95">if you are looking at if you&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="1064.74" dur="5.97">at a foreign citizen</text>
  <text start="1068.13" dur="4.95">and you have reason to believe that</text>
  <text start="1070.71" dur="5.28">foreign citizen is about to blow up a</text>
  <text start="1073.08" dur="6.24">bank or is about to crash an airplane or</text>
  <text start="1075.99" dur="6.929">is plotting a terrorist attack at a</text>
  <text start="1079.32" dur="7.109">nightclub if the person is a foreign</text>
  <text start="1082.919" dur="6.271">citizen and if you have reason to</text>
  <text start="1086.429" dur="4.891">believe that they pose a clear and</text>
  <text start="1089.19" dur="6.27">present danger to national security</text>
  <text start="1091.32" dur="6.87">you can access the database you can do a</text>
  <text start="1095.46" dur="5.04">query you can get information about them</text>
  <text start="1098.19" dur="6.57">and you do not need to get a warrant</text>
  <text start="1100.5" dur="6.12">from the FISA Court because there is a</text>
  <text start="1104.76" dur="5.25">there is an understanding that if it is</text>
  <text start="1106.62" dur="5.07">national security that you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1110.01" dur="3.48">take the time to have to fill out an</text>
  <text start="1111.69" dur="3.93">affidavit get supervisors to sign a</text>
  <text start="1113.49" dur="2.79">ticket down to court you need to act on</text>
  <text start="1115.62" dur="5.429">it right away</text>
  <text start="1116.28" dur="7.649">so the way that it is drawn up if the</text>
  <text start="1121.049" dur="4.831">person is a foreign citizen and if there</text>
  <text start="1123.929" dur="5.511">are an immediate threat to national</text>
  <text start="1125.88" dur="7.02">security you do not need a warrant okay</text>
  <text start="1129.44" dur="6.28">that is really the only case in which</text>
  <text start="1132.9" dur="5.759">you don&amp;#39;t need a warrant to access the</text>
  <text start="1135.72" dur="7.589">database in every other now to say this</text>
  <text start="1138.659" dur="6.931">if that foreign person was simply making</text>
  <text start="1143.309" dur="4.651">phone calls between you know them an</text>
  <text start="1145.59" dur="4.14">American citizen about some bank</text>
  <text start="1147.96" dur="3.449">transactions or whatever and there&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1149.73" dur="4.74">you can&amp;#39;t really prove that they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1151.409" dur="5.041">threat to national security then you</text>
  <text start="1154.47" dur="4.62">would go to FISA Court you&amp;#39;d fill out</text>
  <text start="1156.45" dur="4.8">the application and you get a warrant or</text>
  <text start="1159.09" dur="4.56">you don&amp;#39;t even really get a warrant you</text>
  <text start="1161.25" dur="2.82">get an approval to make a query is what</text>
  <text start="1163.65" dur="2.37">it is</text>
  <text start="1164.07" dur="5.64">the term warrant this really kind of</text>
  <text start="1166.02" dur="5.789">misnomer the FISA Court authorizes you</text>
  <text start="1169.71" dur="3.719">to make a query into the database</text>
  <text start="1171.809" dur="6.98">it&amp;#39;s a query approval that&amp;#39;s what it</text>
  <text start="1173.429" dur="8.521">really is so how you access the database</text>
  <text start="1178.789" dur="5.711">depends on the type of investigation you</text>
  <text start="1181.95" dur="4.32">have going on the type of person you the</text>
  <text start="1184.5" dur="4.049">target the type of person that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1186.27" dur="3.72">looking at and the agency that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1188.549" dur="3.63">working for if you&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1189.99" dur="4.02">counterterrorism counterintelligence if</text>
  <text start="1192.179" dur="4.951">you&amp;#39;re involved if you&amp;#39;re in a DOJ or</text>
  <text start="1194.01" dur="6.04">FBI and your job is national security</text>
  <text start="1197.13" dur="6.07">you have a much more</text>
  <text start="1200.05" dur="4.44">leeway in looking into the database if</text>
  <text start="1203.2" dur="3.51">you&amp;#39;re just working in a criminal</text>
  <text start="1204.49" dur="3.57">division or if you&amp;#39;re working for some</text>
  <text start="1206.71" dur="3.39">other division that doesn&amp;#39;t involve</text>
  <text start="1208.06" dur="3.6">national security you&amp;#39;re almost always</text>
  <text start="1210.1" dur="6.57">gonna have to go get a warrant before</text>
  <text start="1211.66" dur="8.52">you access a database so the thing that</text>
  <text start="1216.67" dur="14.22">we found out this is what Sundance has</text>
  <text start="1220.18" dur="15.06">found through digging is the FBI was</text>
  <text start="1230.89" dur="8.43">allowing private contractors to access</text>
  <text start="1235.24" dur="7.17">the FISA database getting raw</text>
  <text start="1239.32" dur="6.42">intelligence information on US citizens</text>
  <text start="1242.41" dur="7.38">not only without a warrant we&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="1245.74" dur="7.29">private companies here so legally the</text>
  <text start="1249.79" dur="5.76">only it&amp;#39;s only government agencies that</text>
  <text start="1253.03" dur="5.16">are allowed to access the database the</text>
  <text start="1255.55" dur="6.63">FBI was allowing private companies to do</text>
  <text start="1258.19" dur="8.19">it and Sundance posted this there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1262.18" dur="7.23">there&amp;#39;s a document it&amp;#39;s from the FISA</text>
  <text start="1266.38" dur="5.7">Court proceedings a couple years ago and</text>
  <text start="1269.41" dur="5.55">it&amp;#39;s a long document as like a hundred</text>
  <text start="1272.08" dur="5.93">and some pages and Sundance was plowing</text>
  <text start="1274.96" dur="5.61">through this and found a page where</text>
  <text start="1278.01" dur="5.83">essentially the FISA Court had</text>
  <text start="1280.57" dur="6.51">discovered that the FBI had been</text>
  <text start="1283.84" dur="5.7">allowing private contractors to go in</text>
  <text start="1287.08" dur="4.83">and access the database without a</text>
  <text start="1289.54" dur="4.5">warrant on American citizens they were</text>
  <text start="1291.91" dur="3.9">able to gather raw intelligence and they</text>
  <text start="1294.04" dur="3.63">were using that raw intelligence for</text>
  <text start="1295.81" dur="3.93">nefarious purposes okay</text>
  <text start="1297.67" dur="4.53">this is the kind of thing the FBI has</text>
  <text start="1299.74" dur="4.02">been doing and this is the kind of thing</text>
  <text start="1302.2" dur="4.2">that the mainstream media is not</text>
  <text start="1303.76" dur="7.32">reporting on yet they don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1306.4" dur="7.11">touch this this is so what this is this</text>
  <text start="1311.08" dur="5.13">is the lid - Pandora&amp;#39;s Box this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1313.51" dur="5.85">the biggest deal what&amp;#39;s behind this is</text>
  <text start="1316.21" dur="5.55">even worse because if they did it once</text>
  <text start="1319.36" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s likely they were doing it a lot and</text>
  <text start="1321.76" dur="3.09">they just got caught this one time doing</text>
  <text start="1324.43" dur="4.71">it</text>
  <text start="1324.85" dur="7.2">CrowdStrike right so Sundance is kind of</text>
  <text start="1329.14" dur="4.31">working on the theory that the FBI</text>
  <text start="1332.05" dur="4.85">allowed</text>
  <text start="1333.45" dur="6.66">fusion GPS probably to access the Pfizer</text>
  <text start="1336.9" dur="6.3">database gather information they would</text>
  <text start="1340.11" dur="5.46">take the information create a dossier</text>
  <text start="1343.2" dur="4.98">give the information to Christopher</text>
  <text start="1345.57" dur="4.47">steel who had then doctor it up at his</text>
  <text start="1348.18" dur="4.68">own information they would then hand</text>
  <text start="1350.04" dur="6">that back to the FBI the FBI would go to</text>
  <text start="1352.86" dur="5.6">FISA Court and get a warrant or a query</text>
  <text start="1356.04" dur="4.59">approval to go back and do more</text>
  <text start="1358.46" dur="7.24">intelligence gathering on the truck team</text>
  <text start="1360.63" dur="7.62">but it looks like the FBI gave access to</text>
  <text start="1365.7" dur="5.13">private contractors to the database to</text>
  <text start="1368.25" dur="4.17">gather the information from which they</text>
  <text start="1370.83" dur="5.7">would go back to the database and get</text>
  <text start="1372.42" dur="7.47">more information it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s crazy and</text>
  <text start="1376.53" dur="4.89">look here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the thing we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="1379.89" dur="3.54">don&amp;#39;t know who the private companies are</text>
  <text start="1381.42" dur="4.41">we don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s CrowdStrike we</text>
  <text start="1383.43" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="1385.83" dur="3.83">but those are the two companies that</text>
  <text start="1387.24" dur="4.68">were on the payroll of Perkins Coie</text>
  <text start="1389.66" dur="4.81">Perkins quois the law firm that was</text>
  <text start="1391.92" dur="5.94">retained by the DNC Hillary Clinton</text>
  <text start="1394.47" dur="6.12">Barack Obama and John Podesta all the</text>
  <text start="1397.86" dur="4.8">big-name Democrats and the DNC they all</text>
  <text start="1400.59" dur="3.54">use the same law firm that law firm pays</text>
  <text start="1402.66" dur="2.1">all these agencies they hired</text>
  <text start="1404.13" dur="3.93">CrowdStrike</text>
  <text start="1404.76" dur="6.09">they hired to do the investigation into</text>
  <text start="1408.06" dur="5.61">their server hack they hired fusion GPS</text>
  <text start="1410.85" dur="7.98">so they all keep it kind of in under one</text>
  <text start="1413.67" dur="7.02">roof we don&amp;#39;t know the facts but the</text>
  <text start="1418.83" dur="7.53">facts are coming out this is what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1420.69" dur="14.34">learning and and and look I&amp;#39;m going to</text>

  <text start="1568.75" dur="7.32">dream progressed I realized that tweets</text>
