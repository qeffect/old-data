  <text start="8.84" dur="5.259">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.88" dur="4.82">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="2.601">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="21.85" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="39.45" dur="6.06">in these talks I&amp;#39;ve had to say a good</text>
  <text start="42.3" dur="6.18">deal about prayer and before going on to</text>
  <text start="45.51" dur="5.25">my main subject tonight I&amp;#39;d like to deal</text>
  <text start="48.48" dur="6.18">with a difficulty some people find about</text>
  <text start="50.76" dur="6.9">the whole idea of prayer somebody put it</text>
  <text start="54.66" dur="6.3">to me by saying I can believe in God all</text>
  <text start="57.66" dur="5.7">right but what I can&amp;#39;t swallow is this</text>
  <text start="60.96" dur="4.62">idea of him listening to several hundred</text>
  <text start="63.36" dur="4.95">million human beings who were all</text>
  <text start="65.58" dur="4.53">addressing him at the same moment and I</text>
  <text start="68.31" dur="6.18">find quite a lot of people feel that</text>
  <text start="70.11" dur="7.619">difficulty well the first thing to note</text>
  <text start="74.49" dur="7.2">is is that the whole sting of it comes</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="6.601">in the words at the same moment most of</text>
  <text start="81.69" dur="5.25">us can imagine a God attending to any</text>
  <text start="84.33" dur="5.94">number of payments if only they come one</text>
  <text start="86.94" dur="6.569">by one and he has an endless time to do</text>
  <text start="90.27" dur="7.05">it so what&amp;#39;s really at the back of the</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="7.11">difficulty is this idea of God having to</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="7.89">put too many things into one moment of</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="9.301">time well that of course is what happens</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="8.64">to us our life comes to us moment by</text>
  <text start="109.92" dur="6.75">moment one moment disappears before the</text>
  <text start="113.85" dur="5.37">next comes along and the room for</text>
  <text start="116.67" dur="6.93">precious little in each that&amp;#39;s what time</text>
  <text start="119.22" dur="7.32">is life and of course you and I tend to</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="6.9">take it for granted that this time</text>
  <text start="126.54" dur="8.25">series this arrangement of past present</text>
  <text start="130.5" dur="8.28">and future isn&amp;#39;t simply the way life</text>
  <text start="134.79" dur="8.55">comes to us but is the way all things</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="7.41">really exist we tend to assume that the</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="7.04">whole universe and God Himself are</text>
  <text start="146.19" dur="8.4">always moving on from a past to a future</text>
  <text start="150.38" dur="7.419">just as we are but many learned men</text>
  <text start="154.59" dur="5.399">don&amp;#39;t agree with that I think people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="157.799" dur="5.791">the theologians who first started the</text>
  <text start="159.989" dur="5.34">idea but some things are not in time at</text>
  <text start="163.59" dur="3.95">all later</text>
  <text start="165.329" dur="4.681">the philosophers took it over and now</text>
  <text start="167.54" dur="3.97">some of the scientists are doing the</text>
  <text start="170.01" dur="7.33">same</text>
  <text start="171.51" dur="9.13">almost certainly God is not in time his</text>
  <text start="177.34" dur="6.96">life doesn&amp;#39;t consist of moments</text>
  <text start="180.64" dur="6.81">following one another if a million</text>
  <text start="184.3" dur="3.99">people are praying for him at 10:30</text>
  <text start="187.45" dur="4.26">tonight</text>
  <text start="188.29" dur="7.02">he hasn&amp;#39;t got to listen to them all in</text>
  <text start="191.71" dur="9.99">that one little snippet which we call</text>
  <text start="195.31" dur="9.54">10:30 10:30 and every other moment from</text>
  <text start="201.7" dur="8.34">the beginning to the end of the world is</text>
  <text start="204.85" dur="6.2">always repression for him if you like to</text>
  <text start="210.04" dur="5.49">put it that way</text>
  <text start="211.05" dur="7.48">he has infinity in which to listen to</text>
  <text start="215.53" dur="6.83">the split-second of prayer put up our</text>
  <text start="218.53" dur="7.35">pilot as his plane crashes in flames</text>
  <text start="222.36" dur="6.28">that&amp;#39;s difficult I know can I try to</text>
  <text start="225.88" dur="3.68">give something not the same but a bit</text>
  <text start="228.64" dur="4.98">like it</text>
  <text start="229.56" dur="7.06">suppose I&amp;#39;m writing it nom I write there</text>
  <text start="233.62" dur="7.08">he laid down her book next moment came a</text>
  <text start="236.62" dur="6.96">knock at the door for Mary who got to</text>
  <text start="240.7" dur="6.09">live in the imaginary time of the story</text>
  <text start="243.58" dur="7.29">there&amp;#39;s no interval between putting down</text>
  <text start="246.79" dur="7.14">the book and hearing the knock but I are</text>
  <text start="250.87" dur="5.67">created between writing the first part</text>
  <text start="253.93" dur="4.98">of that sentence and the second they</text>
  <text start="256.54" dur="5.76">have gone out from ours walk and spent</text>
  <text start="258.91" dur="6.42">the whole are thinking about Mary I know</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="5.82">that&amp;#39;s not a perfect example but it may</text>
  <text start="265.33" dur="5.67">just give a glimpse of what I mean the</text>
  <text start="268.12" dur="6.33">point I want to drive home is the God</text>
  <text start="271" dur="6.87">His infinite attention infinite leisure</text>
  <text start="274.45" dur="6.57">despair for each one of us he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="277.87" dur="5.91">have to take us in the lump you&amp;#39;re as</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="6.54">much alone with him as if you were the</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="7.26">only thing he&amp;#39;d ever created when Christ</text>
  <text start="287.56" dur="6.54">died he died for you individually just</text>
  <text start="291.04" dur="6.39">as much as it had been the only man in</text>
  <text start="294.1" dur="6.75">the world and now I&amp;#39;ll get back to my</text>
  <text start="297.43" dur="4.94">main subject I was pointing out last</text>
  <text start="300.85" dur="4.34">time that</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="6.51">Christian life is simply a process of</text>
  <text start="305.19" dur="7.44">having your natural self changed into a</text>
  <text start="308.88" dur="8.49">Christ self and that this process goes</text>
  <text start="312.63" dur="8.22">on very far inside ones most private</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="5.269">wishes once point of view are the things</text>
  <text start="320.85" dur="5.94">that have to be changed</text>
  <text start="322.639" dur="6.81">that&amp;#39;s why unbelievers complain with</text>
  <text start="326.79" dur="6.54">Christianity&amp;#39;s of it is selfish religion</text>
  <text start="329.449" dur="6.611">isn&amp;#39;t it very selfish even morbid they</text>
  <text start="333.33" dur="5.52">say to be always bothering about the</text>
  <text start="336.06" dur="4.22">inside of your own soul instead of</text>
  <text start="338.85" dur="5.58">thinking of humanity</text>
  <text start="340.28" dur="7.9">now what would an NCO say to a soldier</text>
  <text start="344.43" dur="6.87">who had a dirty rifle and when told to</text>
  <text start="348.18" dur="6.299">clean it replied but sergeant isn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="351.3" dur="5.22">finished selfish even morbid to be</text>
  <text start="354.479" dur="4.651">always bothering about the inside of</text>
  <text start="356.52" dur="5.88">your own rifle instead of thinking of</text>
  <text start="359.13" dur="5.45">the United Nations well we didn&amp;#39;t bother</text>
  <text start="362.4" dur="6.329">about what the NCO would actually say</text>
  <text start="364.58" dur="6.7">you see the point the man is not going</text>
  <text start="368.729" dur="5.881">to be much used to the United Nations if</text>
  <text start="371.28" dur="6.21">his rifle isn&amp;#39;t fit the shoe clip in the</text>
  <text start="374.61" dur="6.63">same way people who are still acting</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="6.799">from their own natural selves won&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="381.24" dur="7.859">much real permanent good to other people</text>
  <text start="384.289" dur="7.981">let me explain that history isn&amp;#39;t just a</text>
  <text start="389.099" dur="6.301">story of bad people doing bad things</text>
  <text start="392.27" dur="6.399">it&amp;#39;s quite as much a story of people</text>
  <text start="395.4" dur="6.93">trying to do good things but somehow</text>
  <text start="398.669" dur="6.991">something goes wrong take the common</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="6.93">expression Cole does charity how do we</text>
  <text start="405.66" dur="7.08">come to say that from experience we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="409.26" dur="6.48">learned how unsympathetic patronizing</text>
  <text start="412.74" dur="6.84">too conceited charitable people often</text>
  <text start="415.74" dur="6">are and yet hundreds and thousands of</text>
  <text start="419.58" dur="6.39">them started out really anxious to do</text>
  <text start="421.74" dur="6.799">good and when they&amp;#39;ve done it somehow it</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="7.41">just wasn&amp;#39;t as good as it ought to be</text>
  <text start="428.539" dur="7.811">the old story what you are comes out in</text>
  <text start="433.38" dur="6.48">what do a crabapple tree</text>
  <text start="436.35" dur="6.87">can&amp;#39;t produce eating apples as long as</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="6.57">the old self is there its taint will be</text>
  <text start="443.22" dur="6.36">over all we do we try to be religious</text>
  <text start="446.43" dur="6.54">and become Pharisee we try to be kind</text>
  <text start="449.58" dur="6.29">and become patronizing social service</text>
  <text start="452.97" dur="5.46">ends in red tape of officialdom</text>
  <text start="455.87" dur="5.95">unselfishness becomes a form of showing</text>
  <text start="458.43" dur="6.06">off I don&amp;#39;t mean of course that were to</text>
  <text start="461.82" dur="3.75">stop trying to be good we&amp;#39;ve got to do</text>
  <text start="464.49" dur="3.63">the best we can</text>
  <text start="465.57" dur="4.86">if the soldiers cruel enough to go into</text>
  <text start="468.12" dur="6.24">battle with a dirty rifle he mustn&amp;#39;t run</text>
  <text start="470.43" dur="7.62">away but I do mean that the real pure</text>
  <text start="474.36" dur="8.91">lies far deeper out of ourselves and</text>
  <text start="478.05" dur="8.52">enterprise we must go the chains won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="6.57">promote of us happen suddenly and I must</text>
  <text start="486.57" dur="5.55">admit that for most Christians it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="489.84" dur="5.19">only be beginning for the very end of</text>
  <text start="492.12" dur="5.18">our present life but there are some in</text>
  <text start="495.03" dur="5.55">whom it goes further even before they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="497.3" dur="6.31">far enough fuel to see it they&amp;#39;re very</text>
  <text start="500.58" dur="4.95">faces and voices are different when you</text>
  <text start="503.61" dur="5.4">meet them you know you&amp;#39;re up against</text>
  <text start="505.53" dur="6.569">something which so to speak begins where</text>
  <text start="509.01" dur="6.27">you leave off something stronger quarter</text>
  <text start="512.099" dur="6.661">happier more alive than ordinary</text>
  <text start="515.28" dur="6.12">humanity now that&amp;#39;s just for</text>
  <text start="518.76" dur="5.7">Christianity as I think has the real</text>
  <text start="521.4" dur="6.36">answer to a question a lot of modern</text>
  <text start="524.46" dur="6.81">people are asking everyone&amp;#39;s heard of</text>
  <text start="527.76" dur="6.99">evolution are men evolved from lower</text>
  <text start="531.27" dur="6.57">types of life and people often ask</text>
  <text start="534.75" dur="6.93">what&amp;#39;s the next step when is the thing</text>
  <text start="537.84" dur="6">beyond men going to appear some</text>
  <text start="541.68" dur="5.13">imaginative writers even try to picture</text>
  <text start="543.84" dur="5.16">what the next step will be like but they</text>
  <text start="546.81" dur="4.2">usually end in nonsense about men with</text>
  <text start="549" dur="3.44">six arms or wing or something of that</text>
  <text start="551.01" dur="4.59">kind</text>
  <text start="552.44" dur="7.09">but the Christians think those people</text>
  <text start="555.6" dur="8.55">are on the wrong tech the next step has</text>
  <text start="559.53" dur="8.46">already appeared the next step is from</text>
  <text start="564.15" dur="5.45">being mere creatures to being sons of</text>
  <text start="567.99" dur="4.73">God</text>
  <text start="569.6" dur="8.13">the new kind of man appeared in Christ</text>
  <text start="572.72" dur="7.74">and other new name little Christ are</text>
  <text start="577.73" dur="6.18">already to be found dotted here and</text>
  <text start="580.46" dur="6.93">there about the earth we Christians</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="6.36">don&amp;#39;t call it evolution because we</text>
  <text start="587.39" dur="6.12">believe it isn&amp;#39;t something coming up out</text>
  <text start="590.27" dur="5.94">of blind nature but something coming</text>
  <text start="593.51" dur="6.63">down from the world of light and power</text>
  <text start="596.21" dur="6.93">and knowledge beyond all nature but if</text>
  <text start="600.14" dur="6.84">you like to call it evolution do the</text>
  <text start="603.14" dur="8.07">next step is there you can become one of</text>
  <text start="606.98" dur="7.62">the new main in Christ if you like or if</text>
  <text start="611.21" dur="8.4">you prefer you can refuse the step and</text>
  <text start="614.6" dur="7.53">sink back now if we take the step it</text>
  <text start="619.61" dur="6.75">involves losing what we now call</text>
  <text start="622.13" dur="6.63">ourselves that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that all the</text>
  <text start="626.36" dur="5.13">people who accept Christ are going to be</text>
  <text start="628.76" dur="6.51">exactly like one another I know it</text>
  <text start="631.49" dur="8.31">sounds if it did if the one Christ and</text>
  <text start="635.27" dur="7.62">he&amp;#39;s to be in us all actually replacing</text>
  <text start="639.8" dur="6.57">our personalities with his own what</text>
  <text start="642.89" dur="5.43">difference will have is between us now</text>
  <text start="646.37" dur="7.56">here I&amp;#39;ve got a rather difficult thing</text>
  <text start="648.32" dur="7.76">to say on the one hand it isn&amp;#39;t true but</text>
  <text start="653.93" dur="6.03">we shall lose our personal differences</text>
  <text start="656.08" dur="7.81">by letting Christ take us over on the</text>
  <text start="659.96" dur="6.93">other hand I don&amp;#39;t think Christ can take</text>
  <text start="663.89" dur="7.59">us over as long as we&amp;#39;re bothering about</text>
  <text start="666.89" dur="8.43">what will happen to our personality and</text>
  <text start="671.48" dur="7.29">I take the first point first if a person</text>
  <text start="675.32" dur="6.62">didn&amp;#39;t know about salt wouldn&amp;#39;t he think</text>
  <text start="678.77" dur="6.3">that anything with such a strong taste</text>
  <text start="681.94" dur="7.81">would kill the taste of all the other</text>
  <text start="685.07" dur="7.08">things in any dish who put it in - we</text>
  <text start="689.75" dur="6.06">know that as a matter of fact it brings</text>
  <text start="692.15" dur="6.75">out their real taste well it&amp;#39;s rather</text>
  <text start="695.81" dur="5.49">like that with Christ when you</text>
  <text start="698.9" dur="4.11">completely given up yourself to his</text>
  <text start="701.3" dur="4.71">personality</text>
  <text start="703.01" dur="7.74">you will then for the first time in your</text>
  <text start="706.01" dur="8.73">life to developing into a real person he</text>
  <text start="710.75" dur="6.96">made the whole world he invented as an</text>
  <text start="714.74" dur="5.46">author invents characters in a book all</text>
  <text start="717.71" dur="8.16">of different men that you and I were</text>
  <text start="720.2" dur="10.23">intended to be our real selves are so to</text>
  <text start="725.87" dur="8.61">speak all waiting for us in him what I</text>
  <text start="730.43" dur="7.77">call myself now is hardly a person at</text>
  <text start="734.48" dur="7.89">all it&amp;#39;s mainly a meeting place for</text>
  <text start="738.2" dur="6.9">various natural forces desires and fears</text>
  <text start="742.37" dur="5.66">at cetera some of which come from my</text>
  <text start="745.1" dur="7.98">ancestors and some from my education</text>
  <text start="748.03" dur="8.38">some perhaps from Devils the self you</text>
  <text start="753.08" dur="8.9">were really intended to be is something</text>
  <text start="756.41" dur="8.85">that lives not from nature but from God</text>
  <text start="761.98" dur="6.88">at the beginning of these talks I said</text>
  <text start="765.26" dur="6.65">there were personalities in God well I</text>
  <text start="768.86" dur="6.48">go further now there are no real</text>
  <text start="771.91" dur="7.57">personality of anywhere else I mean no</text>
  <text start="775.34" dur="6.18">full complete personality it&amp;#39;s only when</text>
  <text start="779.48" dur="6.32">you allow yourself to be drawn into his</text>
  <text start="781.52" dur="7.68">life which will turn into a cruel person</text>
  <text start="785.8" dur="7.06">but on the other hand it&amp;#39;s just no good</text>
  <text start="789.2" dur="7.95">at all going to Christ for the sake of</text>
  <text start="792.86" dur="5.55">developing a fuller personality as long</text>
  <text start="797.15" dur="4.56">as that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re bothering about</text>
  <text start="798.41" dur="6.99">you haven&amp;#39;t begun because the very first</text>
  <text start="801.71" dur="7.71">step toward getting a real self is to</text>
  <text start="805.4" dur="7.1">forget about the self it will come only</text>
  <text start="809.42" dur="5.82">if you&amp;#39;re looking for something else</text>
  <text start="812.5" dur="7.66">that holds you know even for earthly</text>
  <text start="815.24" dur="8.85">matters even in literature or art no man</text>
  <text start="820.16" dur="6.75">who cares about originality will ever be</text>
  <text start="824.09" dur="5.07">original it&amp;#39;s the man who&amp;#39;s only</text>
  <text start="826.91" dur="4.59">thinking about doing a good job or</text>
