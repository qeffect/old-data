  <text start="295.77" dur="5.16">grow into sonship and I believe in the</text>
  <text start="298.889" dur="5.491">next two years you&amp;#39;ll see it escalating</text>
  <text start="300.93" dur="6.6">of sonship and I believe you&amp;#39;ll begin to</text>
  <text start="304.38" dur="5.819">see the holy spirit cleansing out those</text>
  <text start="307.53" dur="6.27">that will be clean so clean in the</text>
  <text start="310.199" dur="7.261">spirit in their spirit tour that they</text>

  <text start="338.849" dur="6.421">rooms whose mind has been cleaned out to</text>
  <text start="341.099" dur="6.031">such an extent their their mind their</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="4.67">will and their motions brought into</text>
  <text start="347.13" dur="7.08">under the control of the of the Lord</text>
  <text start="349.94" dur="8.14">whether it&amp;#39;s going to be spirit now not</text>
  <text start="354.21" dur="6.63">sober spirit and I see within the next</text>
  <text start="358.08" dur="4.829">two years of of the Holy Spirit really</text>
  <text start="360.84" dur="4.5">dealing in our conscious that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="362.909" dur="5.25">violate our conscious in any way if we</text>
  <text start="365.34" dur="4.31">do a immediately repent of it for with a</text>
  <text start="368.159" dur="4.141">clean conscience</text>
  <text start="369.65" dur="5.919">you have communion with the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="5.94">and in that communion you have the</text>
  <text start="375.569" dur="4.891">wisdom of the ages within you the Holy</text>
  <text start="378.24" dur="6.959">Spirit is the creative power of God</text>
  <text start="380.46" dur="9.269">and I see that men have been literally</text>
  <text start="385.199" dur="9.27">born dennou as a first Peter 2:2 and</text>
  <text start="389.729" dur="7.321">they&amp;#39;re born to the Spirit we were born</text>
  <text start="394.469" dur="5.611">Don the logos Word of God but now there</text>
  <text start="397.05" dur="4.05">is a new thing going on and now we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="400.08" dur="3.63">being born</text>
