  <text start="28.89" dur="5.939">sort of the Cuban embassy because</text>
  <text start="31.5" dur="5.34">they&amp;#39;ve displayed symptoms that have</text>
  <text start="34.829" dur="5.941">been very strange and hard to explain</text>
  <text start="36.84" dur="7.08">and ringing in the ears severe headaches</text>
  <text start="40.77" dur="6.23">nausea and some people have suggested</text>
  <text start="43.92" dur="6.6">that they may be the victim of</text>
  <text start="47" dur="6.91">essentially ultrasonic some kind of an</text>
  <text start="50.52" dur="5.34">ultrasonic weapon so we&amp;#39;ve removed</text>
  <text start="53.91" dur="4.379">people from the Cuban embassy over the</text>
  <text start="55.86" dur="4.26">last couple of years and a couple of</text>
  <text start="58.289" dur="5.641">days ago we removed two more people from</text>

  <text start="63.93" dur="6.39">had the same symptoms and whether or not</text>
  <text start="66.689" dur="6.121">this is due to some kind of sonic weapon</text>
  <text start="70.32" dur="4.83">I don&amp;#39;t know they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="72.81" dur="7.59">into it but there&amp;#39;s some strange things</text>
  <text start="75.15" dur="10.02">going on in those embassies I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="80.4" dur="7.109">exactly why this is what&amp;#39;s going on but</text>
  <text start="85.17" dur="5.01">it&amp;#39;s a thing and I want to make you</text>
  <text start="87.509" dur="9.921">aware that another thing I want to make</text>
  <text start="90.18" dur="9.72">you aware of is there is increasing I</text>
  <text start="97.43" dur="7.78">think in the next couple of weeks we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="99.9" dur="8.249">going to see increasing visibility of</text>
  <text start="105.21" dur="5.519">Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and Seth</text>
  <text start="108.149" dur="7.65">rich in the news stories I say that</text>
  <text start="110.729" dur="8.581">because look Q has reminded us and Q has</text>
  <text start="115.799" dur="6.991">not posted since June 2nd which is fine</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="6.659">there&amp;#39;s a lot going on Q has reminded us</text>
  <text start="122.79" dur="4.8">that it&amp;#39;s very likely that the Seth rich</text>
  <text start="125.969" dur="3.66">story is good to come back on the front</text>
  <text start="127.59" dur="4.289">burner in June a couple of reasons</text>
  <text start="129.629" dur="4.281">number one is the Democratic National</text>
  <text start="131.879" dur="5.901">Committee DNC they</text>
  <text start="133.91" dur="7.83">a lawsuit out against President Trump</text>
  <text start="137.78" dur="8.91">that the campaign and named as</text>
  <text start="141.74" dur="7.2">co-defendants in that lawsuit are Donald</text>
  <text start="146.69" dur="5.76">Trump Donald Trump jr. jerk Kushner</text>
  <text start="148.94" dur="5.37">Roger stone pole metaphor WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="152.45" dur="5.49">Julian Assange and a bunch of other</text>
  <text start="154.31" dur="9.93">people who are accused of creating a</text>
  <text start="157.94" dur="8.13">conspiracy to defraud the Democrats - or</text>
  <text start="164.24" dur="5.16">through the election actually Russia is</text>
  <text start="166.07" dur="6.24">named in that lawsuit as well and when</text>
  <text start="169.4" dur="6.66">that lawsuit goes into the discovery</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="6.09">phase and evidence is brought out and</text>
  <text start="176.06" dur="3.87">presented one of the things they&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="178.4" dur="3.57">to do is they&amp;#39;ll have to either get</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="5.4">Julian Assange and WikiLeaks to testify</text>
  <text start="181.97" dur="4.98">or get depositions from them and so one</text>
  <text start="185.33" dur="4.77">of the questions I&amp;#39;ll have to ask is of</text>
  <text start="186.95" dur="6.08">Julian Assange is where did you get the</text>
  <text start="190.1" dur="5.82">emails from that were taken from the DNC</text>
  <text start="193.03" dur="8.77">and at that point even though WikiLeaks</text>
  <text start="195.92" dur="8.01">has never divulged their sources in a</text>
  <text start="201.8" dur="5.64">court of law if they&amp;#39;re asked to give</text>
  <text start="203.93" dur="7.08">their sources they really can&amp;#39;t lie so</text>
  <text start="207.44" dur="5.76">we may find out from Assange if Seth</text>
  <text start="211.01" dur="5.82">rich was in fact the source of his</text>
  <text start="213.2" dur="5.82">emails all of that is going to be coming</text>
  <text start="216.83" dur="4.98">back around on the front burner there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="219.02" dur="6.719">another lawsuit out right now Seth</text>
  <text start="221.81" dur="5.07">Rich&amp;#39;s brother has sued WikiLeaks Julian</text>
  <text start="225.739" dur="3.331">Assange</text>
  <text start="226.88" dur="4.94">I think Matt crouch is naming the</text>
  <text start="229.07" dur="6.6">lawsuit as defendants twitter has</text>
  <text start="231.82" dur="6.03">subpoenaed the direct messages of all of</text>
  <text start="235.67" dur="6.15">those people as part of the court</text>
  <text start="237.85" dur="6.97">proceedings and again there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="241.82" dur="4.71">lawsuit and now WikiLeaks and Assange</text>
  <text start="244.82" dur="5.43">are going to be asked to testify give</text>
  <text start="246.53" dur="5.34">depositions so if you&amp;#39;re interested in</text>
  <text start="250.25" dur="3.03">Seth rich and very interested in Julian</text>
  <text start="251.87" dur="3.18">Assange and WikiLeaks and what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="253.28" dur="3.06">on all of that is going to be coming to</text>
  <text start="255.05" dur="3.749">a head here in the next month or so</text>
  <text start="256.34" dur="4.53">possibly I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;ve been looking</text>
  <text start="258.799" dur="4.111">at to see if I can find a court date any</text>
  <text start="260.87" dur="4.68">of that haven&amp;#39;t found court dates but</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="5.49">it&amp;#39;s something we can look forward to in</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="8.53">the not-too-distant future</text>
  <text start="268.4" dur="9.7">let&amp;#39;s see if what else I can show you</text>
  <text start="274.08" dur="8.55">here is news real quick just scrolling</text>
  <text start="278.1" dur="8.22">through my news timeline Homeland</text>
  <text start="282.63" dur="10.11">Security Committee Chair Ron Johnson has</text>
  <text start="286.32" dur="7.68">asked for Obama era communications with</text>
  <text start="292.74" dur="3.36">Homeland Security</text>
  <text start="294" dur="3.45">that would have been Jay Johnson here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="296.1" dur="6.18">the head of Homeland Security 8th time</text>
  <text start="297.45" dur="7.85">and Obama and Comey and/or a Lynch he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="302.28" dur="5.73">asking for communications that they had</text>
  <text start="305.3" dur="5.89">around the time of the beginning of the</text>
  <text start="308.01" dur="6.63">Russia investigation this is interesting</text>
  <text start="311.19" dur="6.39">because Homeland Security is one of</text>
  <text start="314.64" dur="5.16">about four committees now that are kind</text>
  <text start="317.58" dur="4.41">of hard on the trail on pursuing the</text>
  <text start="319.8" dur="3.93">origination of the Russia investigation</text>
  <text start="321.99" dur="5.22">the House Intelligence Committee is</text>
  <text start="323.73" dur="6.57">pursuing it the House Judiciary is</text>
  <text start="327.21" dur="6.32">pursuing it and Homeland Security is</text>
  <text start="330.3" dur="5.4">also pursuing it so this issue is being</text>
  <text start="333.53" dur="5.2">investigated from a number of different</text>
  <text start="335.7" dur="6.06">angles and I expect we&amp;#39;ll be hearing</text>
  <text start="338.73" dur="6.33">news on that next week</text>

  <text start="409.83" dur="4.619">inspector general&amp;#39;s report the report</text>
  <text start="412.08" dur="6.45">itself shouldn&amp;#39;t have any reductions in</text>

  <text start="418.53" dur="4.44">of fact it is a it&amp;#39;ll explain the basis</text>
  <text start="421.32" dur="4.379">of the investigation this is primarily</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="5.61">due has to do with the hillary clinton</text>

  <text start="432.419" dur="5.091">surprised it&amp;#39;s just a straightforward</text>
  <text start="433.919" dur="6.12">report the scope of the investigation</text>
  <text start="437.51" dur="5.43">what they found what they investigated</text>
  <text start="440.039" dur="6.901">what their recommendations are for</text>
  <text start="442.94" dur="5.71">Department of Justice and FBI they could</text>
  <text start="446.94" dur="4.64">make criminal referrals they will</text>
  <text start="448.65" dur="5.19">definitely make some institutional</text>
  <text start="451.58" dur="4">recommendations as far as policy and</text>
  <text start="453.84" dur="3.54">procedure so those are the kind of</text>
  <text start="455.58" dur="5.119">things we&amp;#39;ll probably see in the in the</text>

  <text start="469.38" dur="4.259">right this is going to segue into one of</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="7.739">the things I want to talk about on a</text>
  <text start="473.639" dur="9.09">long term so yesterday I ran in a honey</text>
  <text start="479.639" dur="6.361">year reading that story this morning and</text>
  <text start="482.729" dur="6.421">Iranian official was reading a report</text>
  <text start="486" dur="7.77">and basically in front of the Iranian</text>
  <text start="489.15" dur="6.18">press they admitted their part in the</text>
  <text start="493.77" dur="5.97">9/11 terror attacks that they</text>
  <text start="495.33" dur="6.899">facilitated the movement of terrorists</text>
  <text start="499.74" dur="4.32">through Iran and into the United States</text>
  <text start="502.229" dur="5.881">so they could fly the planes into the</text>
  <text start="504.06" dur="8.34">building&amp;#39;s it is very curious that Iran</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="8.19">made that admission yesterday this is on</text>
  <text start="512.4" dur="5.069">June 8th I&amp;#39;m going to go on to some</text>
  <text start="516.3" dur="3.59">other things and I&amp;#39;ll come back to that</text>
  <text start="517.469" dur="2.421">in just a minute</text>
  <text start="523.219" dur="6.521">Department of Justice has asked a Texas</text>
  <text start="526.83" dur="5.73">district court to invalidate more</text>
  <text start="529.74" dur="4.82">Obamacare regulations DOJ seems to be</text>
  <text start="532.56" dur="4.09">chipping away at Obamacare</text>
  <text start="534.56" dur="5.04">they hadn&amp;#39;t been able to get Congress to</text>
  <text start="536.65" dur="5.46">completely dismantle the whole thing so</text>
  <text start="539.6" dur="5.58">they&amp;#39;re taking it apart piece by piece</text>
  <text start="542.11" dur="6.15">debbie Wasserman Schultz this is kind of</text>
  <text start="545.18" dur="5.58">in the headlines again look if you are</text>

  <text start="556.88" dur="5.3">your frustration there have been I think</text>
  <text start="558.74" dur="7.83">five delays in the hearings involving</text>

  <text start="566.57" dur="10.769">congressional scandal it&amp;#39;s my belief</text>
  <text start="570.56" dur="9.96">that the prosecution is being delayed</text>
  <text start="577.339" dur="6.331">for a purpose now you can disagree with</text>
  <text start="580.52" dur="6.03">me and I may be wrong but I believe the</text>
  <text start="583.67" dur="5.37">prosecution is being delayed to bring it</text>
  <text start="586.55" dur="8.789">as close to the midterm elections as</text>
  <text start="589.04" dur="6.92">possible it is my hope that when the</text>
  <text start="595.339" dur="3.631">Awana</text>
  <text start="595.96" dur="5.98">scandal goes to goes to court and is</text>

  <text start="1116.84" dur="5.13">are still spending this Russia phobia</text>

  <text start="1123.82" dur="7.48">this is still that narrative has left</text>
  <text start="1127.73" dur="5.46">over from Obama and Hillary and Hillary</text>
  <text start="1131.3" dur="4.68">was spinning that that narrative because</text>
  <text start="1133.19" dur="6.12">her job was to get us into a war with</text>
  <text start="1135.98" dur="6.63">Russia that was Hillary&amp;#39;s job she was</text>
  <text start="1139.31" dur="5.16">supposed to be elected they were going</text>
  <text start="1142.61" dur="5.28">to allow Iran in North Korea to get</text>
  <text start="1144.47" dur="5.37">nuclear weapons and then we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1147.89" dur="3.96">have a nuclear war and they were going</text>
  <text start="1149.84" dur="3.18">to was basically going to be a war</text>
  <text start="1151.85" dur="4.38">between the United States and Russia</text>
  <text start="1153.02" dur="6.78">with Iran s probably a proxy and or</text>
  <text start="1156.23" dur="7.64">North Korea wipe out our countries and</text>
  <text start="1159.8" dur="6.63">then the United Nations could come in</text>
  <text start="1163.87" dur="5.29">dissolve international borders have a</text>
  <text start="1166.43" dur="4.47">global government that was the plan</text>
  <text start="1169.16" dur="5.64">Trump came in and screwed that up</text>
  <text start="1170.9" dur="6.99">because he defeated Hillary but in the</text>
  <text start="1174.8" dur="5.49">back of their minds they still had this</text>
  <text start="1177.89" dur="4.65">agenda that they want to provoke a war</text>
  <text start="1180.29" dur="7.86">between Russia and United States that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1182.54" dur="8.37">their agenda now Trump during the</text>
  <text start="1188.15" dur="5.43">campaign was trying to tell people what</text>
  <text start="1190.91" dur="5.25">would be so bad if we got along with</text>
  <text start="1193.58" dur="5.43">Russia why do people feel that we have</text>
  <text start="1196.16" dur="5.16">to be at war with Russia why can&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="1199.01" dur="5.34">get along with them</text>
  <text start="1201.32" dur="4.47">and you know in the intervening two</text>
  <text start="1204.35" dur="3.99">years there&amp;#39;s been a lot of water under</text>
  <text start="1205.79" dur="7.65">the bridge and Trump is now trying to</text>
  <text start="1208.34" dur="7.08">get the world leaders to look at Russia</text>
  <text start="1213.44" dur="3.36">with some different eyes he&amp;#39;s trying to</text>
  <text start="1215.42" dur="2.63">get Americans to look at Russia with</text>
  <text start="1216.8" dur="3.03">some different eyes and I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="1218.05" dur="8.17">where this is going</text>
  <text start="1219.83" dur="12.71">all right so Q has told us been telling</text>
  <text start="1226.22" dur="12.06">us since March that Iran is next okay</text>
  <text start="1232.54" dur="8.77">Trump and his people were able to get</text>
  <text start="1238.28" dur="7.05">removed the CIA influence in North Korea</text>
  <text start="1241.31" dur="6.21">cut the strings of control and at that</text>
  <text start="1245.33" dur="7.02">point Kim jong-un was better better to</text>
  <text start="1247.52" dur="7.41">able to make smart decisions and that is</text>
  <text start="1252.35" dur="5.61">why Kim jong-un is going to be meeting</text>
  <text start="1254.93" dur="7.74">with Trump in Singapore over the next</text>
  <text start="1257.96" dur="7.38">few days because they were able to get</text>
  <text start="1262.67" dur="10.16">rid of the corruption and the control of</text>
  <text start="1265.34" dur="9.6">the CIA now he was told us Iran is next</text>
  <text start="1272.83" dur="2.5">all right I&amp;#39;m gonna get to that in a</text>
  <text start="1274.94" dur="4.95">minute</text>
  <text start="1275.33" dur="10.05">but I want to look briefly at how Trump</text>
  <text start="1279.89" dur="9">was able to get Kim jong-un to volunteer</text>
  <text start="1285.38" dur="6.21">to denuclearize North Korea and come to</text>
  <text start="1288.89" dur="10.62">the peace table and he did it through</text>
  <text start="1291.59" dur="11.52">China Trump understood the weakness of</text>
  <text start="1299.51" dur="7.77">China&amp;#39;s economy and really their</text>
  <text start="1303.11" dur="7.11">weaknesses raw materials China does not</text>
  <text start="1307.28" dur="4.89">have the infrastructure to mine and</text>
  <text start="1310.22" dur="4.55">manufacturer raw materials to import</text>
  <text start="1312.17" dur="4.86">most of what they what they go through</text>
  <text start="1314.77" dur="4.21">production was they&amp;#39;re not able to</text>
  <text start="1317.03" dur="4.35">really mine up a lot of you know</text>
  <text start="1318.98" dur="5.45">aluminum steel but they had to import</text>
  <text start="1321.38" dur="6.48">raw materials into their country</text>
  <text start="1324.43" dur="7.09">fabricate goods goods and then and then</text>
  <text start="1327.86" dur="5.61">export them Trump knows that and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1331.52" dur="2.97">why the steel and the aluminum tariffs</text>
  <text start="1333.47" dur="3.64">are so</text>
  <text start="1334.49" dur="5.65">damaging to China because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1337.11" dur="5.16">heavily dependent on bringing in steel</text>
  <text start="1340.14" dur="5.49">and aluminum with other things into</text>
  <text start="1342.27" dur="5.67">their country for manufacturing so Trump</text>
  <text start="1345.63" dur="7.74">has been applied economic pressure on</text>
  <text start="1347.94" dur="7.92">China for the last year and his goal was</text>
  <text start="1353.37" dur="4.74">not just to level the playing field with</text>
  <text start="1355.86" dur="6.84">China in the United States but his</text>
  <text start="1358.11" dur="9.38">secondary goal was to get president GE</text>
  <text start="1362.7" dur="11.58">to negotiate peace with Kim jong-un</text>
  <text start="1367.49" dur="12.15">so North Korea is a satellite of China</text>
  <text start="1374.28" dur="8.01">and whatever Kim jong-un is beholden to</text>
  <text start="1379.64" dur="4.5">president gee whatever President Xi says</text>
  <text start="1382.29" dur="5.13">Kim jong-un pretty much has to do it</text>
  <text start="1384.14" dur="9.57">okay there is a similar relationship</text>
  <text start="1387.42" dur="10.14">between Iran and Russia the Iranian</text>
  <text start="1393.71" dur="9.4">leaders are in a large part under the</text>
  <text start="1397.56" dur="8.12">control of Vladimir Putin and the way</text>
  <text start="1403.11" dur="5.64">the Trump is going to get Iran</text>
  <text start="1405.68" dur="6.34">denuclearized into the peace table is by</text>
  <text start="1408.75" dur="4.76">working with Russia now here&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1412.02" dur="9.3">think we&amp;#39;re going to see over the next</text>
  <text start="1413.51" dur="9.91">three or four months when Vladimir Putin</text>
  <text start="1421.32" dur="5.37">was accused and Russia was accused of</text>
  <text start="1423.42" dur="6.09">poisoning that former KGB agent in</text>
  <text start="1426.69" dur="6.45">London what happened</text>
  <text start="1429.51" dur="5.52">Trump put the finger on Putin said he</text>
  <text start="1433.14" dur="7.29">used that nerve agent to poison that</text>
  <text start="1435.03" dur="7.5">former KGB agent and all of Europe fell</text>
  <text start="1440.43" dur="3.81">behind Trump they got the end Trump and</text>
  <text start="1442.53" dur="4.65">they applied economic sanctions to</text>
  <text start="1444.24" dur="5.52">Russia when you apply economic sanctions</text>
  <text start="1447.18" dur="5.48">as a large bloc of Nations on one nation</text>
  <text start="1449.76" dur="5.49">it hurts that nation&amp;#39;s economic output</text>
  <text start="1452.66" dur="4.45">it&amp;#39;s harder for them to do trade hard</text>
  <text start="1455.25" dur="5.76">for the new imports and exports it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1457.11" dur="6.87">just difficult Trump is a master of</text>
  <text start="1461.01" dur="6.12">using economic trade and sanctions to</text>
  <text start="1463.98" dur="4.77">get what he wants so</text>
  <text start="1467.13" dur="3.95">whenever Trump is talking about trade</text>
  <text start="1468.75" dur="5.58">tariffs embargoes things of that nature</text>
  <text start="1471.08" dur="5.14">sanctions he is talking about his</text>
  <text start="1474.33" dur="3.27">strategy to accomplish what he wants to</text>
  <text start="1476.22" dur="6.24">do all right</text>
  <text start="1477.6" dur="9.06">so Russia has been under economic</text>

  <text start="1486.66" dur="7.04">to ease the sanctions on Russia to make</text>
  <text start="1490.02" dur="6.51">life better for Vladimir Putin okay</text>
  <text start="1493.7" dur="7.24">Russia has a relatively small economy</text>
  <text start="1496.53" dur="6.75">and when you compare to Germany China</text>
  <text start="1500.94" dur="3.99">United States Russia&amp;#39;s economy is</text>
  <text start="1503.28" dur="3.9">relatively small its heavily dependent</text>

  <text start="1514.62" dur="7.86">life hell if he wants to</text>
  <text start="1516.86" dur="7.96">so Trump mentioned to the world</text>
  <text start="1522.48" dur="3.96">yesterday you know it would be kind of</text>
  <text start="1524.82" dur="3.66">cool if we were able to bring Russia</text>
  <text start="1526.44" dur="3.54">into the fold if we were allowed to</text>
  <text start="1528.48" dur="3.24">bring Russia into the economic</text>
  <text start="1529.98" dur="3.75">discussions if we got rid of the</text>
  <text start="1531.72" dur="3.86">sanctions and if we allowed Russia to</text>
  <text start="1533.73" dur="5.58">have a seat at the table</text>
  <text start="1535.58" dur="6.28">Trump was signaling to Vladimir Putin if</text>

  <text start="1557.52" dur="7.98">a signal to the other nations that Trump</text>
  <text start="1562.65" dur="5.52">is the one who is in control the Trump</text>
  <text start="1565.5" dur="5.1">is not going to have terms dictated to</text>
  <text start="1568.17" dur="5.82">him he is in control and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="1570.6" dur="5.91">do it his way or they&amp;#39;re gonna be out in</text>
  <text start="1573.99" dur="4.23">the cold and look this is a this is a</text>
  <text start="1576.51" dur="5.97">really complex situation I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1578.22" dur="6.45">explain one more facet the significance</text>
  <text start="1582.48" dur="8.04">of the United States pulling out of the</text>
  <text start="1584.67" dur="9.17">Iran deal is that I red head was able to</text>
  <text start="1590.52" dur="8.04">do trade with Germany and France and the</text>
  <text start="1593.84" dur="6.67">UK under the Iran deal now that the</text>
  <text start="1598.56" dur="2.49">United States has pulled out of the Iran</text>
  <text start="1600.51" dur="3.27">deal</text>
  <text start="1601.05" dur="5.49">we are going to apply economic sanctions</text>
  <text start="1603.78" dur="7.82">on any country that does trade with your</text>
  <text start="1606.54" dur="9.66">honor that includes Germany UK France</text>
  <text start="1611.6" dur="7.06">Spain Italy anyone if you do trade with</text>
  <text start="1616.2" dur="3.93">Iran because we have pulled out of the</text>
  <text start="1618.66" dur="3.51">deal and we about finding atomic</text>
  <text start="1620.13" dur="4.2">sanctions we&amp;#39;re gonna apply economic</text>
  <text start="1622.17" dur="6.12">sanctions to you now here&amp;#39;s the problem</text>
  <text start="1624.33" dur="8.73">for Europe the Iranian leaders have</text>
  <text start="1628.29" dur="6.51">already said that if Europe cancels the</text>
  <text start="1633.06" dur="4.7">trade deals that they&amp;#39;ve already got in</text>
  <text start="1634.8" dur="6.21">place the Iranian leaders are going to</text>
  <text start="1637.76" dur="4.75">tell the world how much blackmail money</text>
  <text start="1641.01" dur="3.69">how many how much they took in bribes</text>
  <text start="1642.51" dur="4.65">that the Iranian leaders are going to</text>
  <text start="1644.7" dur="4.98">expose the bribery and corruption of the</text>
  <text start="1647.16" dur="6.81">European leaders if they get back out of</text>
  <text start="1649.68" dur="7.92">the trade deals okay so the European</text>
  <text start="1653.97" dur="6.78">leaders are in a pickle if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1657.6" dur="4.98">play ball with Iran they&amp;#39;re exposed and</text>
  <text start="1660.75" dur="5.39">their bribery and corruption is made</text>
  <text start="1662.58" dur="6.92">public if they stay in the economic</text>
  <text start="1666.14" dur="6.13">trade deal that they made with Iran</text>
  <text start="1669.5" dur="6.21">they&amp;#39;re gonna suffer sanctions from the</text>
  <text start="1672.27" dur="9.12">US so they&amp;#39;re in a very difficult spot</text>
  <text start="1675.71" dur="8.17">Trump has managed to put much of Europe</text>
  <text start="1681.39" dur="5.25">in a very difficult spot economically</text>
  <text start="1683.88" dur="5.93">and he has the ability to make life very</text>
  <text start="1686.64" dur="6.78">difficult for all of them if he wants to</text>
  <text start="1689.81" dur="7.84">Trump&amp;#39;s goal his end game is to</text>
  <text start="1693.42" dur="6.77">denuclearize Iran and have a peace</text>
  <text start="1697.65" dur="6.06">agreement with them and have everyone</text>
  <text start="1700.19" dur="6.16">have fair trade and allow everyone to</text>
  <text start="1703.71" dur="4.47">prosper but he&amp;#39;s going to he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1706.35" dur="6.74">have to go about this very strategically</text>
  <text start="1708.18" dur="8.88">and that involves playing Russia and</text>
  <text start="1713.09" dur="7.15">Europe and Iran in this little game</text>
  <text start="1717.06" dur="5.13">where he has to get them to to agree to</text>
  <text start="1720.24" dur="5.34">do the right things they all have their</text>
  <text start="1722.19" dur="6.27">own self-interests and Trump is trying</text>
  <text start="1725.58" dur="6.78">to lead them into an agreement that is</text>
  <text start="1728.46" dur="5.03">mutually beneficial for everyone so what</text>
  <text start="1732.36" dur="4.96">now</text>
  <text start="1733.49" dur="7.189">what I said about 20 minutes ago Iran</text>
  <text start="1737.32" dur="8.17">suddenly comes out and publicly admits</text>
  <text start="1740.679" dur="8.981">that they were complicit in the 9/11</text>
  <text start="1745.49" dur="7.76">disaster why why yesterday why yesterday</text>
  <text start="1749.66" dur="7.26">did you read all of a sudden admit guilt</text>
  <text start="1753.25" dur="6.309">this on the same day Trump sent an</text>
  <text start="1756.92" dur="6.93">overture to Putin saying we&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="1759.559" dur="4.891">have you in the g7 coincidence I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1763.85" dur="5.4">think so</text>
  <text start="1764.45" dur="6.99">I almost wonder if Putin didn&amp;#39;t tell the</text>
  <text start="1769.25" dur="5.309">Iranian leaders you need to start</text>
  <text start="1771.44" dur="10.11">cooperating with this agenda that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1774.559" dur="8.731">gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna roll out and I think</text>
  <text start="1781.55" dur="3.78">we&amp;#39;re good and here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1783.29" dur="4.4">happen what they&amp;#39;re at so look at what</text>
  <text start="1785.33" dur="8.66">happened with North Korea North Korea</text>
  <text start="1787.69" dur="9.22">was building missiles testing missiles</text>
  <text start="1793.99" dur="5.26">developing nuclear technology right up</text>
  <text start="1796.91" dur="4.71">until the point in November of last year</text>
  <text start="1799.25" dur="5.1">where Trump went and visited Asia and as</text>
  <text start="1801.62" dur="5.16">soon as Trump met with President Xi in</text>
  <text start="1804.35" dur="4.8">China that was the end of Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1806.78" dur="4.08">missile testing program was done there</text>
  <text start="1809.15" dur="5">have been no missile test since last</text>
  <text start="1810.86" dur="6.39">November so there was aggression</text>
  <text start="1814.15" dur="5.68">military buildup weapons testing right</text>
  <text start="1817.25" dur="5.88">up until the point where Trump struck a</text>
  <text start="1819.83" dur="6.66">deal with China to get North Korea to</text>
  <text start="1823.13" dur="6.03">stop their testing I expect the same</text>
  <text start="1826.49" dur="5.31">thing is gonna happen with Iran Iran has</text>
  <text start="1829.16" dur="6">already I think a week ago said that</text>
  <text start="1831.8" dur="5.87">they have completed an assembly plant</text>
  <text start="1835.16" dur="5.97">that is going to be used to make</text>
  <text start="1837.67" dur="5.56">centrifuges to enrich uranium you can</text>
  <text start="1841.13" dur="4.08">expect Iran to continue to enrich</text>
  <text start="1843.23" dur="4.29">uranium to continue working on their</text>
  <text start="1845.21" dur="6.09">weapons program right up until the point</text>
  <text start="1847.52" dur="8.37">where Trump and Vladimir Putin have a</text>
  <text start="1851.3" dur="6.87">talk and Trump tells Putin you are going</text>
  <text start="1855.89" dur="4.38">to be our favorite trading partner but</text>
  <text start="1858.17" dur="4.59">you have got to get Iran to shut down</text>
  <text start="1860.27" dur="5.46">their nuclear program right now today</text>
  <text start="1862.76" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s over Putin is then going to have to</text>
  <text start="1865.73" dur="6.329">put pressure on our</text>
  <text start="1866.9" dur="7.409">and to get them to shut down I think</text>
  <text start="1872.059" dur="5.461">we&amp;#39;re going to see a similar evolution</text>
  <text start="1874.309" dur="5.161">of events with Iran and Russia that we</text>
  <text start="1877.52" dur="3.45">saw with North Korea and China if you</text>
  <text start="1879.47" dur="3.54">look at what they did there it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1880.97" dur="4.98">to be very similar with with Iran and</text>
  <text start="1883.01" dur="5.82">Russia Trump Trump has a formula a</text>
  <text start="1885.95" dur="6.06">strategy that has worked and he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1888.83" dur="5.97">to stick with that formula and so when</text>
  <text start="1892.01" dur="5.07">you see Trump talking about Russia in</text>
  <text start="1894.8" dur="4.17">the future and talking about giving them</text>
  <text start="1897.08" dur="5.51">a seat at the table taking no economic</text>
  <text start="1898.97" dur="8.37">sanctions and taking a hard line with</text>
  <text start="1902.59" dur="8.8">Canada UK Germany and France it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1907.34" dur="8.4">because he&amp;#39;s maneuvering these pieces to</text>
  <text start="1911.39" dur="5.73">get them into alignment where everything</text>
  <text start="1915.74" dur="8.72">will work out the way it needs to work</text>
  <text start="1917.12" dur="10.5">out so that is my news update for today</text>
  <text start="1924.46" dur="7.69">I&amp;#39;m gonna let you go I&amp;#39;ve got some yes</text>
  <text start="1927.62" dur="8.61">honey dreams to share had a dream about</text>
  <text start="1932.15" dur="5.159">Trump last night actually I should tell</text>
  <text start="1936.23" dur="10.23">you about the dream I had last night</text>
  <text start="1937.309" dur="13.411">so last night I had a dream about about</text>
  <text start="1946.46" dur="8.55">Trump and pence this is just weird dream</text>
  <text start="1950.72" dur="6.62">so I was listening to them talk and they</text>
  <text start="1955.01" dur="4.5">used this word I&amp;#39;d never heard of before</text>
  <text start="1957.34" dur="5.77">it was like a word that doesn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1959.51" dur="6.78">exist in English they used this word and</text>
  <text start="1963.11" dur="6.63">I in the dream that word struck me as</text>
  <text start="1966.29" dur="5.1">being odd and I made note of it and I</text>
  <text start="1969.74" dur="2.22">thought I need to find out what that</text>
  <text start="1971.39" dur="3.05">word means</text>
  <text start="1971.96" dur="4.83">so I went and researched in this</text>
  <text start="1974.44" dur="5.71">spiritual world dictionary</text>
  <text start="1976.79" dur="7.08">I started looking up this word and I</text>
  <text start="1980.15" dur="8.46">found it and I didn&amp;#39;t find a meaning for</text>
  <text start="1983.87" dur="8.4">the word what I found was the word when</text>
  <text start="1988.61" dur="7.38">a person said that particular word it</text>
  <text start="1992.27" dur="7.2">released power that was the thing about</text>
  <text start="1995.99" dur="4.27">that word when you said that word boom</text>
  <text start="1999.47" dur="3.88">it</text>
  <text start="2000.26" dur="7.05">released energy power into the world</text>
  <text start="2003.35" dur="6.42">when you when you use that word now the</text>
  <text start="2007.31" dur="5.19">strength thing about that word was as I</text>
  <text start="2009.77" dur="4.43">was researching this word I realized</text>
  <text start="2012.5" dur="4.71">that people like Eric Schmidt and</text>
  <text start="2014.2" dur="7.51">Hillary Clinton had also used the same</text>
  <text start="2017.21" dur="8.1">word in the past but when they used the</text>
  <text start="2021.71" dur="6.87">word it released much less energy less</text>
  <text start="2025.31" dur="5.22">power than when Trump competitive and</text>
  <text start="2028.58" dur="4.92">that was what I noticed and looked at</text>
  <text start="2030.53" dur="5.76">how Hillary and Eric Schmidt used that</text>
  <text start="2033.5" dur="4.2">word the power released was very little</text>
  <text start="2036.29" dur="5.28">because they were using it for evil</text>
  <text start="2037.7" dur="7.11">purposes but when I looked at Trump and</text>
  <text start="2041.57" dur="6.66">pence using that word the power that it</text>
  <text start="2044.81" dur="8.13">released was was great it was a lot of</text>
  <text start="2048.23" dur="5.28">power so that that was the dream I had</text>
  <text start="2052.94" dur="3.9">last night</text>
  <text start="2053.51" dur="6.69">and look I had these dreams that are</text>
  <text start="2056.84" dur="7.079">very abstract and they&amp;#39;re sometimes hard</text>
  <text start="2060.2" dur="7.11">it is hard to describe but these rooms</text>
  <text start="2063.919" dur="6.901">are symbolic what it means what that</text>
  <text start="2067.31" dur="5.73">dream means very simply is people like</text>
  <text start="2070.82" dur="5.359">Eric Schmidt and Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="2073.04" dur="10.68">Barack Obama had used power in the past</text>
  <text start="2076.179" dur="10.24">for evil purposes and the unwise unjust</text>
  <text start="2083.72" dur="5.55">use of power does not release the full</text>
  <text start="2086.419" dur="6.541">potential of power when leaders like</text>
  <text start="2089.27" dur="5.909">Trump and pence exercise power correctly</text>
  <text start="2092.96" dur="4.56">the power released is much greater when</text>
  <text start="2095.179" dur="5.251">it&amp;#39;s used for good purposes that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2097.52" dur="6.27">essentially the meaning of the dream all</text>
  <text start="2100.43" dur="6.03">right so there you go so I&amp;#39;ll have for</text>
