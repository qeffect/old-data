  <text start="297.02" dur="7.519">been killed and I will say this about</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="6.98">Iran I was noticing this this morning</text>
  <text start="304.539" dur="7.121">listening to Sarah Huckabee Sanders and</text>
  <text start="307.84" dur="6.85">her press conference and how the press</text>
  <text start="311.66" dur="7.17">is obsessed with this Steve Bannon story</text>
  <text start="314.69" dur="6.59">they will not let go of it now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="318.83" dur="5.88">looking at this and I&amp;#39;m thinking okay</text>
  <text start="321.28" dur="5.59">what is going on with this Steve ban and</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="5.28">drama all right this guy wrote this book</text>
  <text start="326.87" dur="5.669">and in it he quotes and the thing looks</text>
  <text start="329.99" dur="4.38">like it&amp;#39;s almost completely fiction just</text>
  <text start="332.539" dur="5.341">looking at the excerpts from it it looks</text>
  <text start="334.37" dur="7.079">like this guy just made stuff up and he</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="7.58">quotes bananas having all this nasty</text>
  <text start="341.449" dur="7.02">dirty stuff to say about the Trump&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="345.46" dur="6.04">once the media got ahold of it they are</text>
  <text start="348.469" dur="6.061">not letting it go they&amp;#39;re like a dog</text>
  <text start="351.5" dur="6.12">with a frisbee I mean again to use the</text>
  <text start="354.53" dur="4.56">analogy Trump might as well have staked</text>
  <text start="357.62" dur="4.56">a goat out in front of the White House</text>
  <text start="359.09" dur="4.74">and call the wolves in because he threw</text>
  <text start="362.18" dur="4.47">that van and stir that thing got thrown</text>
  <text start="363.83" dur="9.63">out there and the press will not let go</text>
  <text start="366.65" dur="9">of this Bannen story now if you know the</text>
  <text start="373.46" dur="5.519">President and you know that he is</text>
  <text start="375.65" dur="4.199">strategic and what he does and I told</text>
  <text start="378.979" dur="3.631">you yesterday</text>
  <text start="379.849" dur="5.971">Trump is notorious for throwing some</text>
  <text start="382.61" dur="6.179">shiny stuff over there shiny stuff hey</text>
  <text start="385.82" dur="4.469">look there shiny stuff over there and</text>
  <text start="388.789" dur="4.021">then over here something else is going</text>
  <text start="390.289" dur="4.821">on what is this something else that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="392.81" dur="6.529">going on all right what I have noticed</text>
  <text start="395.11" dur="4.229">go to Mike Pence&amp;#39;s Twitter timeline</text>
  <text start="399.63" dur="5.25">go to the State Department website and</text>
  <text start="401.99" dur="9.19">go find out what general mattis has been</text>

  <text start="432.24" dur="7.83">more important issue right now</text>
  <text start="435.24" dur="7.05">I suspect that Trump is trying to get</text>
  <text start="440.07" dur="5.1">some traction on a very important issue</text>
  <text start="442.29" dur="5.85">to him which is Iran and he doesn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="445.17" dur="5.34">the media all over it I suspect Trump</text>
  <text start="448.14" dur="4.41">wants the media as far away from Iran as</text>
  <text start="450.51" dur="3.99">he can get them doesn&amp;#39;t want them</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="4.59">looking into Iran or what we&amp;#39;re doing</text>

  <text start="921.98" dur="7.44">trying to undo some of that damage now</text>
  <text start="926.6" dur="4.14">the problem created here was these were</text>
  <text start="929.42" dur="4.32">some memos</text>
  <text start="930.74" dur="3.9">these were not laws that were passed by</text>
  <text start="933.74" dur="4.11">Congress</text>
  <text start="934.64" dur="7.5">they were memos written by the executive</text>
  <text start="937.85" dur="6.75">branch to overlook certain laws that is</text>
  <text start="942.14" dur="6.38">not how you enforce laws you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="944.6" dur="8.19">enforce a memo memos are not enforceable</text>
  <text start="948.52" dur="5.89">you have laws and that&amp;#39;s what when you</text>
  <text start="952.79" dur="3.419">when you&amp;#39;re a law enforcement officer</text>
  <text start="954.41" dur="4.92">you go to law enforcement school they</text>
  <text start="956.209" dur="5.641">give you the the state penal code and</text>
  <text start="959.33" dur="5.49">that is what you charge people with if</text>
  <text start="961.85" dur="4.62">they are suspected guilty of a crime you</text>
  <text start="964.82" dur="2.22">look up the Penal Code and you charge</text>
  <text start="966.47" dur="2.1">them with it</text>
  <text start="967.04" dur="5.489">you don&amp;#39;t charge people you know</text>
  <text start="968.57" dur="7.079">prosecute them based on memos all right</text>
  <text start="972.529" dur="6.991">so what is the problem with sanctuary</text>
  <text start="975.649" dur="8.431">cities the problem with sanctuary cities</text>
  <text start="979.52" dur="7.35">is certain mayors and governors have</text>
  <text start="984.08" dur="4.949">decided they do not want immigration law</text>
  <text start="986.87" dur="5.52">to be enforced in their cities or in</text>
  <text start="989.029" dur="7.171">their states yes there&amp;#39;s a federal law</text>
  <text start="992.39" dur="7.11">yes it the federal law demands that if a</text>
  <text start="996.2" dur="5.52">person has committed a crime and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="999.5" dur="4.17">an illegal alien they need to be</text>
  <text start="1001.72" dur="5.34">deported that&amp;#39;s what the federal law</text>
  <text start="1003.67" dur="7.109">says people don&amp;#39;t like sanctuary city</text>
  <text start="1007.06" dur="5.61">laws because it allows criminal illegal</text>
  <text start="1010.779" dur="6.841">aliens to stay in the country illegally</text>
  <text start="1012.67" dur="8.85">who should be deported and that is if</text>
  <text start="1017.62" dur="5.85">you allow that you&amp;#39;re allowing selective</text>
  <text start="1021.52" dur="3.72">enforcement of a lot and people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1023.47" dur="4.5">like that because they don&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1025.24" dur="5.4">selective enforcement law should be</text>
  <text start="1027.97" dur="6.06">applied universally to everybody without</text>
  <text start="1030.64" dur="7.559">regard to situation and this marijuana</text>
  <text start="1034.03" dur="6.72">law is the same type of problem some</text>
  <text start="1038.199" dur="4.171">people don&amp;#39;t want to enforced because</text>
  <text start="1040.75" dur="3.689">it&amp;#39;s inconvenient because it&amp;#39;s one of</text>
  <text start="1042.37" dur="4.829">their pet issues and they want the</text>
  <text start="1044.439" dur="6.201">government to overlook it well if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1047.199" dur="6.571">in law enforcement that&amp;#39;s a problem so</text>
  <text start="1050.64" dur="5.5">from a law enforcement perspective laws</text>
  <text start="1053.77" dur="4.74">need to be black-and-white not gray it</text>
  <text start="1056.14" dur="4.64">if you don&amp;#39;t have black and white laws</text>
  <text start="1058.51" dur="5.8">and if you don&amp;#39;t enforce the laws</text>
  <text start="1060.78" dur="8.39">universally and blindly to everyone</text>
  <text start="1064.31" dur="6.27">you create situational ethics where some</text>
  <text start="1069.17" dur="3.69">cases are overlooked I&amp;#39;m not gonna</text>
  <text start="1070.58" dur="4.38">prosecute this person I like this person</text>
  <text start="1072.86" dur="4.59">I don&amp;#39;t like this law I&amp;#39;m gonna I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1074.96" dur="5.13">gonna overlook that and you create chaos</text>
  <text start="1077.45" dur="6.45">it&amp;#39;s very difficult for law enforcement</text>
  <text start="1080.09" dur="7.53">to do their job when the laws are not</text>
  <text start="1083.9" dur="5.07">black-and-white and look I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1087.62" dur="3.9">perfectly honest this is really a</text>
