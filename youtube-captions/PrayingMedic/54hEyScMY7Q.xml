  <text start="319.44" dur="4.59">this I&amp;#39;ve just skimmed through the</text>
  <text start="322.11" dur="6.27">report and I picked out some things that</text>
  <text start="324.03" dur="7.83">I noted that I think are relevant this</text>
  <text start="328.38" dur="7.259">is on page six and it talks about what</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="7.5">is not included in the report included</text>
  <text start="335.639" dur="5.761">is a non-public classified appendix</text>
  <text start="339.36" dur="4.559">which discusses highly classified</text>
  <text start="341.4" dur="4.17">information relevant to the meteor</text>
  <text start="343.919" dur="5.461">investigation the mid-year investigation</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="6.15">was the FBI&amp;#39;s internal term for the</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="4.68">Clinton email investigation that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="351.72" dur="3.81">appendix one there is a non public law</text>
  <text start="354.06" dur="3.66">enforcement sensitive appendix</text>
  <text start="355.53" dur="5.27">containing the complete unmodified</text>
  <text start="357.72" dur="5.16">version of chapter 13 that&amp;#39;s appendix 2</text>
  <text start="360.8" dur="4.42">and then it says we&amp;#39;re providing copies</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.86">of our unclassified and the classified</text>
  <text start="365.22" dur="4.259">appendix to Congress and we are publicly</text>
  <text start="367.74" dur="4.739">releasing our report with these</text>
  <text start="369.479" dur="5.19">appendices we&amp;#39;re also providing copies</text>
  <text start="372.479" dur="4.341">of our unclassified report to the</text>
  <text start="374.669" dur="5.881">official the Office of Special Counsel</text>
  <text start="376.82" dur="7.93">for its consideration I look through it</text>
  <text start="380.55" dur="7.17">and when I got to the end and all the</text>
  <text start="384.75" dur="4.919">attachments and appendices there are two</text>
  <text start="387.72" dur="3.81">things that are obvious there there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="389.669" dur="4.231">classified appendix that we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="391.53" dur="3.78">access to and there&amp;#39;s a law enforcement</text>
  <text start="393.9" dur="3">sensitive appendix that we also don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="395.31" dur="5.97">have access to</text>
  <text start="396.9" dur="6.72">and this also says that there are two</text>
  <text start="401.28" dur="4.95">versions of chapter 13 which is in the</text>
  <text start="403.62" dur="6.6">recommendations and conclusions part of</text>
  <text start="406.23" dur="6.3">that chapter has been is classified and</text>
  <text start="410.22" dur="4.8">we don&amp;#39;t have access to that I would say</text>
  <text start="412.53" dur="5.07">this I suspect there&amp;#39;s a lot more in the</text>
  <text start="415.02" dur="4.89">original document that Horowitz sent</text>
  <text start="417.6" dur="8.01">over to the DOJ than what we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="419.91" dur="9.27">right now also I found this I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="425.61" dur="6.96">kind of perusing through this is on page</text>
  <text start="429.18" dur="5.16">89 FBI analysts and prosecutor number</text>
  <text start="432.57" dur="4.53">two told us that former President Barack</text>
  <text start="434.34" dur="4.95">Obama was one of 13 individuals with</text>
  <text start="437.1" dur="4.5">whom Clinton had direct contact using</text>
  <text start="439.29" dur="3.42">her Clinton email comm account Obama</text>
  <text start="441.6" dur="3.27">like other high-level government</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="4.26">officials used a pseudonym for his</text>
  <text start="444.87" dur="4.35">username on his official government</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="3.75">email account the analysts told us that</text>
  <text start="449.22" dur="2.13">they questioned whether Obama&amp;#39;s email</text>
  <text start="450.72" dur="2.73">address</text>
  <text start="451.35" dur="3.66">combined with Salutations it revealed</text>
  <text start="453.45" dur="3.81">that the emails were being exchanged</text>
  <text start="455.01" dur="4.29">with Obama or other information</text>
  <text start="457.26" dur="4.47">containing the emails were classified</text>
  <text start="459.3" dur="5.54">and thus sent the emails to relevant</text>
  <text start="461.73" dur="6.36">USIC agencies for classification review</text>
  <text start="464.84" dur="5.2">because this is a review of how the DOJ</text>
  <text start="468.09" dur="4.97">in the FBI conducted the email</text>
  <text start="470.04" dur="6.3">investigation much of the discussion</text>
  <text start="473.06" dur="6.76">involves Clinton emails and we now have</text>
  <text start="476.34" dur="5.58">confirmation that Barack Obama and many</text>
  <text start="479.82" dur="3.51">people in his administration were</text>
  <text start="481.92" dur="4.29">communicating with Hillary on an</text>
  <text start="483.33" dur="4.98">unsecured server which the FBI admits</text>
  <text start="486.21" dur="5.88">they pretty much know was hacked by</text>
  <text start="488.31" dur="6.66">foreign governments when trey gowdy</text>
  <text start="492.09" dur="6.66">and will talk about his responses here</text>
  <text start="494.97" dur="5.85">pretty quick said that he was deeply</text>
  <text start="498.75" dur="4.17">disappointed and shocked that there are</text>
  <text start="500.82" dur="3.96">actually allegations here that could be</text>
  <text start="502.92" dur="4.8">made for espionage this is what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="4.8">talking about the president and the</text>
  <text start="507.72" dur="4.92">Secretary of State were communicating it</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="5.52">by private emails on an unsecured server</text>
  <text start="512.64" dur="5.04">that fell into the hands of foreign</text>
  <text start="515.1" dur="5.16">governments all right so if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="517.68" dur="4.68">think that the IG report is damning that</text>
  <text start="520.26" dur="7.8">is one thing right there that is very</text>
  <text start="522.36" dur="7.39">very damaging speaking of Hillary she</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="4.69">got a little snarky and</text>
  <text start="529.75" dur="5.82">had her little smarty pants remark but</text>
  <text start="532.75" dur="3.27">my emails she&amp;#39;s thinking that this is no</text>
  <text start="535.57" dur="2.91">big deal</text>
  <text start="536.02" dur="6.15">well she&amp;#39;s thinking she&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="538.48" dur="6.96">be convicted or arrested this is another</text>
  <text start="542.17" dur="5.55">thing that I found interesting in 2016</text>
  <text start="545.44" dur="4.47">the FBI had an open investigation into</text>
  <text start="547.72" dur="4.8">the Clinton Foundation now that is a</text>
  <text start="549.91" dur="3.86">different matter from the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="552.52" dur="4.74">investigation</text>
  <text start="553.77" dur="6.39">remember the Inspector General is</text>
  <text start="557.26" dur="5.88">actually investigating four or five</text>
  <text start="560.16" dur="4.87">different subjects right now and the</text>
  <text start="563.14" dur="3.93">email investigation is the first report</text>
  <text start="565.03" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s going to come out we&amp;#39;ll also get</text>
  <text start="567.07" dur="3.15">a report on the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="569.11" dur="3.53">investigation and some other</text>
  <text start="570.22" dur="5.55">investigations that are ongoing so</text>
  <text start="572.64" dur="5.02">continuing Comey refused to confirm the</text>
  <text start="575.77" dur="5.07">existence of the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="577.66" dur="4.8">investigation on July 7th 2016 in</text>
  <text start="580.84" dur="3.72">testimony before the House Oversight and</text>
  <text start="582.46" dur="4.53">Government Reform Committee because the</text>
  <text start="584.56" dur="4.32">investigation was not public this is</text>
  <text start="586.99" dur="5.13">very interesting to me because in the</text>
  <text start="588.88" dur="5.37">lead-up to the election in 2016 there</text>
  <text start="592.12" dur="6.42">was a criminal investigation that</text>
  <text start="594.25" dur="6.33">involved Hillary Clinton and the FBI</text>
  <text start="598.54" dur="3.6">refused to acknowledge it before</text>
  <text start="600.58" dur="2.42">Congress and wouldn&amp;#39;t talk about it</text>
  <text start="602.14" dur="6.33">publicly</text>
  <text start="603" dur="7.48">now commis explanation for not making</text>
  <text start="608.47" dur="3.95">that information public was that it</text>
  <text start="610.48" dur="5.31">wasn&amp;#39;t a public matter</text>
  <text start="612.42" dur="5.13">but I suspect the real reason was if</text>
  <text start="615.79" dur="3.54">Comey admitted that hillary a</text>
  <text start="617.55" dur="4.21">presidential candidate was under</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="5.88">criminal investigation it would have</text>
  <text start="621.76" dur="5.91">cost her the election and the FBI was in</text>
  <text start="625.21" dur="3.63">the bag for hillary so there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="627.67" dur="3.12">they were going to let the public know</text>
  <text start="628.84" dur="4.92">that hillary was under criminal</text>
  <text start="630.79" dur="4.53">investigation Trump at that time was</text>
  <text start="633.76" dur="5.19">under a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="635.32" dur="5.91">investigation but hillary was under</text>
  <text start="638.95" dur="4.77">criminal investigation and the FBI</text>
  <text start="641.23" dur="2.82">didn&amp;#39;t want us to know that okay moving</text>
  <text start="643.72" dur="4.85">on</text>
  <text start="644.05" dur="8.13">this is commis response to the report I</text>
  <text start="648.57" dur="5.41">respect the DOJ IG office which is why I</text>
  <text start="652.18" dur="3.36">urged them to do this review the</text>
  <text start="653.98" dur="3.9">conclusions are reasonable even though I</text>
  <text start="655.54" dur="3.99">disagree with some people of good faith</text>
  <text start="657.88" dur="4.83">can see an unprecedented situation</text>
  <text start="659.53" dur="3.66">differently I pray no director faces it</text>
  <text start="662.71" dur="3.09">again</text>
  <text start="663.19" dur="4.89">thanks to the IG people for hard work so</text>
  <text start="665.8" dur="3.84">Comey is basically like this is water</text>
  <text start="668.08" dur="2.55">off a duck&amp;#39;s back I&amp;#39;m not worried about</text>
  <text start="669.64" dur="4.89">it</text>
  <text start="670.63" dur="7.65">it doesn&amp;#39;t really implicate me I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="674.53" dur="7.17">on with my life and because Hillary and</text>

  <text start="828.13" dur="6.33">the tweet was from June 5th so the</text>

  <text start="873.01" dur="5.16">May why is it mid-june president is</text>
  <text start="876.22" dur="4.65">suggesting that the report is being</text>
  <text start="878.17" dur="5.49">changed and made weaker by Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="880.87" dur="4.8">before it&amp;#39;s made public so that is a</text>
  <text start="883.66" dur="4.38">clear hint by the president that</text>
  <text start="885.67" dur="5.55">something is going on that we need to be</text>
  <text start="888.04" dur="7.32">concerned about as we continue along on</text>
  <text start="891.22" dur="5.64">my thread here there are various</text>

  <text start="896.86" dur="6.48">report I think some people&amp;#39;s opinions</text>
  <text start="900.28" dur="4.74">are more valuable than others and the</text>
  <text start="903.34" dur="5.34">people whose opinions I think are the</text>
  <text start="905.02" dur="6.39">most important are insiders in DC people</text>
  <text start="908.68" dur="6.39">in Congress and the president who know</text>
