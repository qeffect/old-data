  <text start="189.62" dur="7.16">so um I have some questions for you I</text>
  <text start="192.56" dur="7.2">primarily was hoping to talk today about</text>
  <text start="196.78" dur="4.99">ministry to the broken soul your</text>
  <text start="199.76" dur="3.66">experiences with that but how did you</text>
  <text start="201.77" dur="3.5">get for people who don&amp;#39;t know much about</text>
  <text start="203.42" dur="5.55">you how did you get started ministry I</text>
  <text start="205.27" dur="6.55">was growing up in middle-class family</text>
  <text start="208.97" dur="4.769">always went to good churches you know it</text>
  <text start="211.82" dur="4.889">was usually like the biggest Church in</text>
  <text start="213.739" dur="3.481">town the most recognized Church in town</text>
  <text start="216.709" dur="3.421">you know</text>
  <text start="217.22" dur="5.519">which was often Baptist I mean I I had</text>
  <text start="220.13" dur="9.63">the typical goals you know nice big</text>
  <text start="222.739" dur="8.161">house to expensive cars to point you</text>
  <text start="229.76" dur="6.27">know Golden Retriever</text>
  <text start="230.9" dur="8.88">you know lalala and but I fell in love</text>
  <text start="236.03" dur="5.28">with the Lord and that was the most</text>
  <text start="239.78" dur="3.06">important thing to me I was like weeding</text>
  <text start="241.31" dur="5">Leonard Ravenhill when I was in high</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="6.3">school and aw Tozier and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="246.31" dur="4.84">but still pretty much trying to head in</text>
  <text start="249.14" dur="4.92">the same direction as everybody else and</text>
  <text start="251.15" dur="5.369">people began to say Richard you&amp;#39;re comin</text>
  <text start="254.06" dur="6.75">in the ministry and I would be like what</text>
  <text start="256.519" dur="5.731">no you know and for a couple reasons I</text>
  <text start="260.81" dur="2.94">was sure that wasn&amp;#39;t true because I</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="4.979">didn&amp;#39;t like talking in front of people</text>
  <text start="263.75" dur="5.6">and just that you know the main things</text>
  <text start="267.229" dur="4.471">that I thought of as being in ministry</text>
  <text start="269.35" dur="4.42">weren&amp;#39;t things that I felt comfortable</text>
  <text start="271.7" dur="5.85">doing that but I love telling people</text>
  <text start="273.77" dur="6.149">about Jesus of witness to people and I</text>
  <text start="277.55" dur="3.72">just spent time on reward so people</text>
  <text start="279.919" dur="4.951">began to see some</text>
  <text start="281.27" dur="5.4">and began to say it was around my junior</text>
  <text start="284.87" dur="4.86">senior year that I was like I know God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="286.67" dur="4.44">going into the ministry but you know I</text>
  <text start="289.73" dur="4.5">always thought that was going to be</text>
  <text start="291.11" dur="5.04">something more traditional and you know</text>
  <text start="294.23" dur="3.3">was going to Bible College I heard about</text>
  <text start="296.15" dur="3.9">being a missionary I thought that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.53" dur="4.83">where I spend my life because the</text>
  <text start="300.05" dur="4.38">missionaries that I met we&amp;#39;re mostly</text>
  <text start="302.36" dur="4.11">telling people about Jesus and spending</text>
  <text start="304.43" dur="4.71">time you know reaching out to the lost</text>
  <text start="306.47" dur="5.76">and things like that and I look back but</text>
  <text start="309.14" dur="5.46">not living in a $250,000 house with two</text>
  <text start="312.23" dur="4.23">and a half kids in two cars right and</text>
  <text start="314.6" dur="3">the parent said there&amp;#39;s no way guy can</text>
  <text start="316.46" dur="4.68">call you into the ministry because</text>
  <text start="317.6" dur="7.14">you&amp;#39;re pacing which and I was like well</text>
  <text start="321.14" dur="5.91">maybe you can give me both but you know</text>
  <text start="324.74" dur="5.55">the it was more about serving the Lord</text>
  <text start="327.05" dur="5.7">than about all that stuff over time so</text>
  <text start="330.29" dur="5.34">how did you get interested and how did</text>
  <text start="332.75" dur="7.38">you get activated in deliverance and</text>
  <text start="335.63" dur="5.7">inner healing I again I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="340.13" dur="3.84">interesting way it was in a large</text>
  <text start="341.33" dur="3.84">seeker-sensitive Church we were one of</text>
  <text start="343.97" dur="4.05">the fastest growing churches in the</text>
  <text start="345.17" dur="6.48">southeast at the time ahead of the curve</text>
  <text start="348.02" dur="6.26">way before people knew much about all</text>
  <text start="351.65" dur="5.34">that stuff we were a cell based</text>
  <text start="354.28" dur="4.72">supersensitive Baptist Church when</text>
  <text start="356.99" dur="5.07">nobody had ever put those same words in</text>
  <text start="359" dur="4.77">a sentence I think and I was helping to</text>
  <text start="362.06" dur="3.3">write the discipleship Crick and I mean</text>
  <text start="363.77" dur="5.19">we were copying Willow Creek and</text>
  <text start="365.36" dur="5.19">Saddleback and you know doing what</text>
  <text start="368.96" dur="2.7">everybody else were doing the fast one</text>
  <text start="370.55" dur="3.27">churches in the nation we were just</text>
  <text start="371.66" dur="7.23">copying all that and I began to ask a</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="7.71">question and the question was what does</text>
  <text start="378.89" dur="4.65">a disciple look like in the Bible what</text>
  <text start="381.53" dur="4.23">what did they mean by making disciples</text>
  <text start="383.54" dur="7.8">in the Bible that is a very dangerous</text>
  <text start="385.76" dur="10.32">question yeah who&amp;#39;s better to look at</text>
  <text start="391.34" dur="6.15">the model than Jesus and it was where I</text>
  <text start="396.08" dur="2.82">don&amp;#39;t flip I read the Bible for the</text>
  <text start="397.49" dur="3.75">first time and I honestly had read</text>
  <text start="398.9" dur="4.11">through the Bible many times already it</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="4.14">was something I did every year sometimes</text>
  <text start="403.01" dur="3.72">several times in the year and it but it</text>
  <text start="405.38" dur="3.42">was like I read it for the first time</text>
  <text start="406.73" dur="5.07">because I saw almost instantly Jesus</text>
  <text start="408.8" dur="4.32">taught twelve ordinary guys to cast out</text>
  <text start="411.8" dur="3.04">evil spirits to heal the sick and preach</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="3.82">the kingdom of God</text>
  <text start="414.84" dur="4.25">be honest I wanted to close my Bible put</text>
  <text start="416.94" dur="5.009">it away and forget what I was seeing</text>
  <text start="419.09" dur="4.27">because going to Krispy Kreme Doughnuts</text>
  <text start="421.949" dur="2.22">and maybe one day have your own</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="4.71">franchise</text>
  <text start="424.169" dur="6.06">oh that becomes impossible the</text>
  <text start="428.07" dur="4.05">implications of it Sal I knew like right</text>
  <text start="430.229" dur="5.011">off the bat I&amp;#39;m going this would cost me</text>
  <text start="432.12" dur="5.22">my reputation there&amp;#39;s not a church or</text>
  <text start="435.24" dur="4.92">people that I know that would be open to</text>
  <text start="437.34" dur="4.98">this now you were in a Baptist Church</text>
  <text start="440.16" dur="5.069">did you know people who operate it as a</text>
  <text start="442.32" dur="5.849">miraculous or I did not know anyone well</text>
  <text start="445.229" dur="4.651">I had spent a year not even a full year</text>
  <text start="448.169" dur="5.161">I&amp;#39;d really only spent 10 weeks at last</text>
  <text start="449.88" dur="6.45">days ministering Keith Green had founded</text>
  <text start="453.33" dur="5.64">it it was kind of a while am base at the</text>
  <text start="456.33" dur="4.89">point that I went there right so that</text>
  <text start="458.97" dur="5.16">was the closest I had gotten why Whammer</text>
  <text start="461.22" dur="5.91">type people and hearing testimonials of</text>
  <text start="464.13" dur="6.21">the supernatural and my heart was just</text>
  <text start="467.13" dur="6.89">set on fire for that that&amp;#39;s the type of</text>
  <text start="470.34" dur="7.199">experience that I wanted in seminary</text>
  <text start="474.02" dur="5.05">before this prayer I had traveled with</text>
  <text start="477.539" dur="3.931">Ralph&amp;#39;s neighbor to Singapore Hong Kong</text>

  <text start="483.96" dur="4.56">while we were there in Singapore and in</text>
  <text start="486.18" dur="4.739">some of these other countries we saw</text>
  <text start="488.52" dur="5.82">churches that look identical to what I</text>
  <text start="490.919" dur="5.97">ended up on staff out here from or a</text>
  <text start="494.34" dur="4.949">cell base they were large fast-growing</text>
  <text start="496.889" dur="4.921">making the impact the difference was in</text>
  <text start="499.289" dur="3.991">every small group we went to people were</text>
  <text start="501.81" dur="4.53">telling testimonies of people being</text>
  <text start="503.28" dur="5.1">healed of leading people to Christ</text>
  <text start="506.34" dur="3.87">visiting people in the hospital and</text>
  <text start="508.38" dur="4.8">these were just business people</text>
  <text start="510.21" dur="5.459">housewives and rich people they were</text>

  <text start="533.49" dur="7.53">like God why isn&amp;#39;t it that this type of</text>
  <text start="537.33" dur="6.06">Christianity can happen in America so</text>
  <text start="541.02" dur="6.08">when what timeframe was it this was</text>
  <text start="543.39" dur="5.57">around the late 90s</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="3.69">early 90s is when I went to Singapore</text>

  <text start="593.12" dur="5.16">between the kingdom of God and</text>
  <text start="595.75" dur="5.38">continuing with the pathways that I&amp;#39;d</text>

  <text start="615.77" dur="5.64">extended fasting and for about a</text>
  <text start="619.55" dur="4.53">six-month period of time I began to get</text>

  <text start="698.79" dur="4.12">really learning to hear God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="701.05" dur="3.66">so you&amp;#39;re doubting what even what you</text>
  <text start="702.91" dur="4.32">think you&amp;#39;re hearing maybe it&amp;#39;s just you</text>
  <text start="704.71" dur="4.41">maybe it&amp;#39;s God maybe it&amp;#39;s not you know</text>
  <text start="707.23" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re at a pretty difficult situation</text>
  <text start="709.12" dur="5.31">and this is a situation a lot of people</text>
  <text start="712.09" dur="3.93">are in right now yeah that&amp;#39;s so many</text>
  <text start="714.43" dur="3.99">people and the body of Christ don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="716.02" dur="4.23">how to hear God&amp;#39;s voice that&amp;#39;s I created</text>
  <text start="718.42" dur="4.47">a Study Bible called God speaks and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="720.25" dur="5.04">written a lot on the subject but I do</text>
  <text start="722.89" dur="4.64">when when I speak somewhere and it</text>
  <text start="725.29" dur="5.79">doesn&amp;#39;t matter what denomination is I do</text>
  <text start="727.53" dur="6.67">survey how many of you are not sure that</text>
  <text start="731.08" dur="6.09">you&amp;#39;ve ever heard God speak without fail</text>
  <text start="734.2" dur="4.83">it&amp;#39;s over seventy five percent now that</text>
  <text start="737.17" dur="3.96">they&amp;#39;re the only exceptions that I found</text>
  <text start="739.03" dur="5.43">to that is when I did a conference</text>
  <text start="741.13" dur="5.73">Roberts Reardon and you know it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="744.46" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s all people that have left their</text>

  <text start="749.02" dur="4.02">hear the bill Johnson&amp;#39;s and all people</text>
  <text start="750.91" dur="3.24">like that it worried about about 50%</text>

  <text start="754.15" dur="5.19">ever heard god I was like that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="756.01" dur="5.13">highest percentage that&amp;#39;s the first</text>
  <text start="759.34" dur="4.79">question I asked that I had ever seen</text>
  <text start="761.14" dur="6.63">and then the next question I asked is</text>
  <text start="764.13" dur="4.96">alright how many of you would say I know</text>
  <text start="767.77" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ve heard God but it&amp;#39;s only been a</text>
  <text start="769.09" dur="7.76">handful of times usually when I ask that</text>
  <text start="771.79" dur="9.03">question we are down to at the most</text>
  <text start="776.85" dur="8.8">10-15 percent the next question is how</text>
  <text start="780.82" dur="6.3">many of you go I have heard God and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="785.65" dur="5.64">heard it many times but it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="787.12" dur="6.63">regular daily experience but this time</text>
  <text start="791.29" dur="5.46">I&amp;#39;m at 90 percent of the congregation</text>
  <text start="793.75" dur="6.27">have raised their hand or viewed closer</text>
  <text start="796.75" dur="4.83">than 95 or 99 percent and in the last</text>
  <text start="800.02" dur="4.11">question how many of you go I hear God</text>
  <text start="801.58" dur="5.79">on an almost daily basis and and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="804.13" dur="5.22">anything from 1% to a small percentage</text>
  <text start="807.37" dur="4.11">there&amp;#39;s been there&amp;#39;s one church where</text>
  <text start="809.35" dur="2.79">the pastor done a great job at equipping</text>
  <text start="811.48" dur="3.93">their people</text>
  <text start="812.14" dur="6.509">and most high percentage of the and I</text>
  <text start="815.41" dur="4.59">was shocked because it was not a church</text>
  <text start="818.649" dur="3.391">I would have expected it but they were</text>
  <text start="820" dur="4.38">like 70% of the people said I hear gone</text>
  <text start="822.04" dur="3.93">on a regular basis and I was like this</text>
  <text start="824.38" dur="3.24">blows me away what am I doing here to</text>
  <text start="825.97" dur="3.33">teach you know and yet they felt like</text>
  <text start="827.62" dur="7.38">they learned a lot at the same time but</text>
  <text start="829.3" dur="7.56">um yeah so it&amp;#39;s sad I was a pastor and I</text>
  <text start="835" dur="3.75">had never had a class seven years of</text>
  <text start="836.86" dur="3.3">theological training never had a class</text>
  <text start="838.75" dur="6.48">on how to hear God&amp;#39;s voice never a</text>

  <text start="866.47" dur="4.65">classes on deliverance</text>
  <text start="868.36" dur="4.979">none of that did buy all at one time</text>
  <text start="871.12" dur="4.5">have a lot of the spirit filled as a</text>
  <text start="873.339" dur="6.391">part of it I don&amp;#39;t know that much about</text>
  <text start="875.62" dur="7.38">it I ran into her because she was healed</text>
  <text start="879.73" dur="6">of bipolar and I interviewed her I think</text>
  <text start="883" dur="5.94">a year or two ago and she just was</text>
  <text start="885.73" dur="5.31">amazed at her the revelation that demons</text>
  <text start="888.94" dur="4.41">are real and you can hear God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="891.04" dur="4.71">and none of this stuff is taught in</text>
  <text start="893.35" dur="5.609">seminary or Bible College in most of</text>
  <text start="895.75" dur="4.769">them anyway which is why schools of</text>
  <text start="898.959" dur="3.661">supernatural ministry are popping up all</text>
  <text start="900.519" dur="3.721">over the place because people are</text>
  <text start="902.62" dur="3.36">starting to figure out you know maybe</text>
  <text start="904.24" dur="4.05">it&amp;#39;s a good idea to teach people out of</text>
  <text start="905.98" dur="5.46">here God&amp;#39;s voice maybe yeah</text>
  <text start="908.29" dur="5.46">there&amp;#39;s a lot of reluctance in the</text>
  <text start="911.44" dur="5.07">church when it comes to the subject of</text>
  <text start="913.75" dur="6.089">deliverance and emotional healing do you</text>
  <text start="916.51" dur="6.509">think that is due to fear and</text>
  <text start="919.839" dur="5.37">misunderstanding about the demonic or is</text>
  <text start="923.019" dur="4.051">it fear of the supernatural is it fear</text>
  <text start="925.209" dur="3.99">of being wrong what do you think it is</text>
  <text start="927.07" dur="5.07">that is the kind of stumbling stone for</text>
  <text start="929.199" dur="5.431">a lot of people I actually believe a lot</text>
  <text start="932.14" dur="5.759">of times it&amp;#39;s fear of what we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="934.63" dur="7.199">about it&amp;#39;s fear of the unknown there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="937.899" dur="5.731">so much misinformation I hear people</text>
  <text start="941.829" dur="3.07">talk about it and they have no</text>
  <text start="943.63" dur="3.129">experience</text>
  <text start="944.899" dur="5">and rather than look at the Bible and go</text>
  <text start="946.759" dur="8.041">if it&amp;#39;s in the Bible it&amp;#39;s got to be true</text>
  <text start="949.899" dur="7.42">they talk about some story they heard of</text>
  <text start="954.8" dur="5.25">somebody trying to cast out demons and</text>
  <text start="957.319" dur="6.27">beating people up or you know it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="960.05" dur="6.389">you get the weirdest stuff and but yeah</text>
  <text start="963.589" dur="6.211">it&amp;#39;s add one caster is to say what</text>
  <text start="966.439" dur="6.301">you&amp;#39;re not up on you&amp;#39;re down on and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="969.8" dur="5.879">the fact that we don&amp;#39;t have any teaching</text>
  <text start="972.74" dur="4.56">to think that you&amp;#39;re a pastor and you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="975.679" dur="3.96">got all this training and have none of</text>
  <text start="977.3" dur="3.87">that then someone else comes along and</text>
  <text start="979.639" dur="3.51">starts talking about something like that</text>
  <text start="981.17" dur="4.289">you&amp;#39;re the one that&amp;#39;s supposed to have</text>
  <text start="983.149" dur="5.61">all the answers at least in your head</text>
  <text start="985.459" dur="6.63">you know and so if you&amp;#39;ve not been</text>
  <text start="988.759" dur="5.281">trained in it then you&amp;#39;re going to be</text>
  <text start="992.089" dur="4.92">afraid of it there&amp;#39;s not a good reason</text>
  <text start="994.04" dur="7.709">to be afraid the more you know the less</text>
  <text start="997.009" dur="6.211">fear you have but I think that that is</text>
  <text start="1001.749" dur="3.96">the big one of the biggest things that</text>
  <text start="1003.22" dur="5.549">keeps people from it that is very true</text>
  <text start="1005.709" dur="6.36">I&amp;#39;ve noticed in my own walk as I become</text>
  <text start="1008.769" dur="6.54">more kind of immersed in the</text>
  <text start="1012.069" dur="6.481">supernatural the fears that I had have</text>
  <text start="1015.309" dur="5.19">pretty much gone away because you gain</text>
  <text start="1018.55" dur="4.259">those life experiences you see some</text>
  <text start="1020.499" dur="5.131">victory you see some cool things happen</text>
  <text start="1022.809" dur="5.88">you know that God is partnering with you</text>
  <text start="1025.63" dur="5.37">and when you see those things happen the</text>
  <text start="1028.689" dur="3.09">fear factor just kind of fades into into</text>
  <text start="1031" dur="2.189">the background</text>
  <text start="1031.779" dur="3.81">and you&amp;#39;re not afraid of those things</text>
  <text start="1033.189" dur="5.85">anymore after a while I&amp;#39;m going to fear</text>
  <text start="1035.589" dur="6.75">that I think is massive is we actually</text>
  <text start="1039.039" dur="7.17">fear the devil which is really really</text>
  <text start="1042.339" dur="6.33">bad theology but based upon experience</text>
  <text start="1046.209" dur="5.1">because a lot of times when you are not</text>
  <text start="1048.669" dur="5.671">doing anything that&amp;#39;s a threat to the</text>
  <text start="1051.309" dur="6.781">enemy then the enemy leaves you alone</text>
  <text start="1054.34" dur="5.85">and so there there is some semblance of</text>
  <text start="1058.09" dur="4.68">reality I know for myself the whole</text>
  <text start="1060.19" dur="4.979">beginning of this was the first time I</text>
  <text start="1062.77" dur="3.87">did an extended fast I was at beginning</text>
  <text start="1065.169" dur="3.901">to ask God to teach me these things I</text>
  <text start="1066.64" dur="5.07">was doing an extended fast and it was</text>
  <text start="1069.07" dur="4.91">like all hell broke loose in my home and</text>
  <text start="1071.71" dur="5.459">that never before had my wife ever seen</text>
  <text start="1073.98" dur="4.329">something in my home my kid woke up in</text>
  <text start="1077.169" dur="1.651">the middle of night two nights in a row</text>
  <text start="1078.309" dur="3.24">saw</text>
  <text start="1078.82" dur="5.88">monster in his room and I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1081.549" dur="4.62">the voice of God well at the time now</text>
  <text start="1084.7" dur="2.76">that I know the Lord&amp;#39;s voice I know it</text>
  <text start="1086.169" dur="5.281">was actually the Spirit of God speaking</text>
  <text start="1087.46" dur="5.16">to me but it was like I knew and so it</text>
  <text start="1091.45" dur="2.52">was God speaking I mean I could I</text>
  <text start="1092.62" dur="3.63">usually when I tell the story I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1093.97" dur="3.449">say God told me because at that time I</text>
  <text start="1096.25" dur="3.47">didn&amp;#39;t know how to hear God&amp;#39;s voice but</text>
  <text start="1097.419" dur="6.211">the Lord told me Richard if you back up</text>
  <text start="1099.72" dur="5.949">the enemy will quiet down but that</text>
  <text start="1103.63" dur="3.84">doesn&amp;#39;t mean he&amp;#39;s going to leave right</text>
  <text start="1105.669" dur="3.331">and that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve noticed and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1107.47" dur="3.299">heard that from a lot of people I get</text>
  <text start="1109" dur="3.899">you know emails all the time and</text>
  <text start="1110.769" dur="4.53">questions from people they start reading</text>
  <text start="1112.899" dur="5.01">my book on hearing God&amp;#39;s voice or seeing</text>
  <text start="1115.299" dur="4.5">in the spirit or healing and they start</text>
  <text start="1117.909" dur="4.74">trying to step out in the supernatural</text>
  <text start="1119.799" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;re trying to operate in authority</text>
  <text start="1122.649" dur="4.351">they&amp;#39;re trying to release power and</text>
  <text start="1124.84" dur="3.569">they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re trying to get demons up</text>
  <text start="1127" dur="2.639">and then their life starts going</text>
  <text start="1128.409" dur="3.031">sideways and like wait a minute I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1129.639" dur="4.77">having these demons attack me at night</text>
  <text start="1131.44" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m having all these problems everything</text>
  <text start="1134.409" dur="3.39">seems to be coming against me what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1135.73" dur="5.49">going on I&amp;#39;m like well you are now</text>
  <text start="1137.799" dur="5.191">engaged in the battle and once you put</text>
  <text start="1141.22" dur="3.839">on the armor and start doing a little</text>
  <text start="1142.99" dur="4.049">bit of warfare enemy is going to try to</text>
  <text start="1145.059" dur="4.171">intimidate you back you down and let you</text>
  <text start="1147.039" dur="5.161">know you&amp;#39;re in for a battle but what I</text>
  <text start="1149.23" dur="4.38">found personally is there&amp;#39;s that season</text>
  <text start="1152.2" dur="3.66">in the beginning usually for most people</text>
  <text start="1153.61" dur="5.88">where there&amp;#39;s an intense warfare and if</text>
  <text start="1155.86" dur="18.21">you get through that the warfare seems -</text>
  <text start="1159.49" dur="17.039">I think comprehensive study God has is</text>
  <text start="1174.07" dur="5.329">doing the bull&amp;#39;s eyes just bigger and</text>
  <text start="1176.529" dur="6.51">the attack has been even more intense</text>
  <text start="1179.399" dur="6.311">but when I know like this times the Lord</text>
  <text start="1183.039" dur="4.321">wakes me up and says you know stuff that</text>
  <text start="1185.71" dur="3.63">might scare other people I won&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1187.36" dur="4.5">mention it but the enemy&amp;#39;s coming after</text>
  <text start="1189.34" dur="4.469">you now that&amp;#39;s okay I mean I I have a</text>
  <text start="1191.86" dur="4.59">friend a Steve Harmon I don&amp;#39;t know if he</text>
  <text start="1193.809" dur="5.46">knows Steve yeah he does a lot of work</text>
  <text start="1196.45" dur="4.92">with people who are victims of satanic</text>
  <text start="1199.269" dur="3.601">ritual abuse yeah and he&amp;#39;s doing it all</text>
  <text start="1201.37" dur="3.38">the time and he gets woke up in the</text>
  <text start="1202.87" dur="4.23">middle of the night by an angel who says</text>
  <text start="1204.75" dur="5.889">they&amp;#39;re coming after you get up and move</text>

  <text start="1216.059" dur="4.531">away completely but you do learn to</text>
  <text start="1218.789" dur="4.11">discern that you know how the Lord is</text>
  <text start="1220.59" dur="4.919">leading you and kind of giving you heads</text>

  <text start="1281.429" dur="6.57">wow too often the way we do warfare is</text>
  <text start="1285.21" dur="4.89">hiding behind a chair and hoping the</text>

  <text start="1293.489" dur="3.211">enemy is trying to do is back you down</text>
  <text start="1294.72" dur="4.62">yeah I intended to intimidate you and</text>
  <text start="1296.7" dur="5.789">cause you to be afraid and if you are</text>
  <text start="1299.34" dur="5.88">not afraid if you don&amp;#39;t back down if you</text>
  <text start="1302.489" dur="6.93">come back at the enemy in boldness that</text>
  <text start="1305.22" dur="8.569">is our warfare our warfare in Ephesians</text>
  <text start="1309.419" dur="7.11">6 is to stand the enemies coming at you</text>

  <text start="1320.97" dur="4.079">like run around and scream and holler</text>
  <text start="1322.559" dur="6.661">you just need to stand against against</text>
  <text start="1325.049" dur="7.021">to get back up in your ministry you use</text>
  <text start="1329.22" dur="4.199">the term a broken soul and ministering</text>
  <text start="1332.07" dur="2.939">to the broken soul can you explain a</text>
  <text start="1333.419" dur="6.45">little bit about what that&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="1335.009" dur="11.16">yeah and James James actually coined a</text>
  <text start="1339.869" dur="10.591">word that they didn&amp;#39;t find in the Greek</text>
  <text start="1346.169" dur="6.09">before he used it and it&amp;#39;s um dip suit</text>
  <text start="1350.46" dur="5.909">gay it&amp;#39;s translated most of the time</text>
  <text start="1352.259" dur="6.42">double minded but it&amp;#39;s actually double</text>
  <text start="1356.369" dur="4.92">sold and then talked about the double</text>
  <text start="1358.679" dur="4.651">sole person is unstable in all his or</text>
  <text start="1361.289" dur="4.47">her way I think the reason we it was not</text>
  <text start="1363.33" dur="5.4">translated double sole is because people</text>
  <text start="1365.759" dur="6.03">couldn&amp;#39;t wrap their heads around someone</text>
  <text start="1368.73" dur="7.019">having two Souls you know if you want to</text>
  <text start="1371.789" dur="6.72">save souls and my soul is saved and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1375.749" dur="6.06">going to heaven and so it made it</text>
  <text start="1378.509" dur="6.03">difficult to translate it double soon</text>
  <text start="1381.809" dur="3.48">but what the enemies understood for a</text>
  <text start="1384.539" dur="4.23">long time</text>
  <text start="1385.289" dur="6.99">is that you can fracture someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1388.769" dur="5.941">psyche Satanists have known it and do it</text>
  <text start="1392.279" dur="5.48">intentionally our military has</text>
  <text start="1394.71" dur="5.52">understood it done and intentionally I</text>
  <text start="1397.759" dur="5.53">like to lay a biblical foundation for</text>
  <text start="1400.23" dur="4.919">stuff and it talks about a heart being</text>
  <text start="1403.289" dur="3.811">broke and it talks about loving the Lord</text>
  <text start="1405.149" dur="4.441">your God with all of your heart your</text>
  <text start="1407.1" dur="7.559">soul your mind strength God binds up the</text>
  <text start="1409.59" dur="7.919">brokenhearted and a lot of the concept</text>
  <text start="1414.659" dur="4.83">behind this type of ministry in this</text>
  <text start="1417.509" dur="6.27">reality has been there in the Word of</text>
  <text start="1419.489" dur="6.51">God for a long time and the realization</text>
  <text start="1423.779" dur="5.071">and the need for it has become more and</text>
  <text start="1425.999" dur="4.351">more apparent I used to think that</text>

  <text start="1434.309" dur="6.421">disassociative identity disorder but</text>
  <text start="1437.159" dur="5.791">that was all demons and began to</text>
  <text start="1440.73" dur="5.309">understand that it&amp;#39;s not all any benefit</text>
  <text start="1442.95" dur="5.599">there&amp;#39;s often broken parts of someone</text>
  <text start="1446.039" dur="5.401">stole and you can actually talk to those</text>
  <text start="1448.549" dur="5.35">different parts now the interesting</text>
  <text start="1451.44" dur="5.01">thing is that it was it&amp;#39;s been very</text>
  <text start="1453.899" dur="5.84">apparent in people who&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed</text>
  <text start="1456.45" dur="7.289">with you know bipolar schizophrenia</text>

  <text start="1466.23" dur="6.029">different types of things and as we</text>
  <text start="1470.159" dur="5.01">began to minister this broken parts of</text>
  <text start="1472.259" dur="4.25">the soul what we came to understand is</text>
  <text start="1475.169" dur="3.47">that</text>
  <text start="1476.509" dur="4.38">any people have that in fact you</text>
  <text start="1478.639" dur="4.62">connected with me because you heard from</text>
  <text start="1480.889" dur="4.35">Jesse Berkey his testimony and the</text>
  <text start="1483.259" dur="3.42">interesting thing was he was just asking</text>
  <text start="1485.239" dur="3.96">what we were doing and I began to</text>
  <text start="1486.679" dur="4.17">describe some of it to him and all of a</text>
  <text start="1489.199" dur="3.75">sudden we were there in a restaurant and</text>
  <text start="1490.849" dur="4.29">he&amp;#39;s going oh my goodness there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1492.949" dur="4.71">something going on inside of me and he</text>
  <text start="1495.139" dur="4.32">goes it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a part of me that</text>
  <text start="1497.659" dur="3.06">wants to say something right now and I</text>
  <text start="1499.459" dur="3.96">said well let&amp;#39;s not do it right here in</text>
  <text start="1500.719" dur="5.04">the restaurant and and we schedule an</text>
  <text start="1503.419" dur="4.47">appointment I have that happen on a</text>
  <text start="1505.759" dur="3.75">regular basis and he would have I would</text>
  <text start="1507.889" dur="2.87">have not put Jesse in the category of</text>
  <text start="1509.509" dur="4.44">someone who needs this kind of ministry</text>
  <text start="1510.759" dur="7.3">man is walking with God you know God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1513.949" dur="6.48">used in powerfully and all I&amp;#39;m doing is</text>
  <text start="1518.059" dur="5.131">telling him testimonies and explaining</text>
  <text start="1520.429" dur="4.92">some of the you know facets of this type</text>
  <text start="1523.19" dur="5.669">of ministry and all of a sudden it</text>
  <text start="1525.349" dur="6.03">begins to happen and I&amp;#39;ve had that</text>
  <text start="1528.859" dur="3.87">happen many times and all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="1531.379" dur="4.5">the next thing you know we&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1532.729" dur="5.07">ministry on the spot with people that I</text>
  <text start="1535.879" dur="5.6">just was kind of explained something to</text>
  <text start="1537.799" dur="8.07">them so it is not just people that have</text>
  <text start="1541.479" dur="6.64">the more obvious brakes i sat and</text>
  <text start="1545.869" dur="3.96">receive ministry not because I had any</text>
  <text start="1548.119" dur="4.44">thought that I needed this kind of</text>
  <text start="1549.829" dur="4.74">ministry but because in our ministry</text>
  <text start="1552.559" dur="5.37">I don&amp;#39;t want anybody ministering with me</text>
  <text start="1554.569" dur="6.78">who&amp;#39;s not willing to see ministry so I</text>
  <text start="1557.929" dur="4.68">was like before I start teaching this to</text>
  <text start="1561.349" dur="2.94">my team I want to go through this kind</text>
  <text start="1562.609" dur="5.28">of ministry just see there&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1564.289" dur="6.39">there and sure enough they were broken</text>
  <text start="1567.889" dur="6.45">card to my soul that could be talked to</text>
  <text start="1570.679" dur="6.87">and I had never been aware of hearing</text>
  <text start="1574.339" dur="4.68">you know some people are very much aware</text>
  <text start="1577.549" dur="1.95">they&amp;#39;re like one I feel like there&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="1579.019" dur="2.61">of me</text>
  <text start="1579.499" dur="4.95">people are like I feel like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1581.629" dur="5.4">multiple personalities or people</text>
  <text start="1584.449" dur="4.65">described it in different ways I had</text>
  <text start="1587.029" dur="4.02">nothing like that that I was aware of</text>
  <text start="1589.099" dur="3.99">they were pretty innocuous there was</text>
  <text start="1591.049" dur="6.21">nothing major I didn&amp;#39;t grow up with any</text>
  <text start="1593.089" dur="7.8">kind of childhood traumas to speak of</text>
  <text start="1597.259" dur="8.15">but it was it was beautiful receive in</text>
  <text start="1600.889" dur="6.99">ministry anyways so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s cool I</text>
  <text start="1605.409" dur="4.151">think I have a testament it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1607.879" dur="3.361">similar to yours I</text>
  <text start="1609.56" dur="4.23">didn&amp;#39;t have a terribly traumatic</text>
  <text start="1611.24" dur="7.14">childhood although as a paramedic I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1613.79" dur="6.87">seen a lot of pretty devastating stuff</text>
  <text start="1618.38" dur="5.28">that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I need some</text>
  <text start="1620.66" dur="5.13">emotional healing from I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot</text>
  <text start="1623.66" dur="6.24">of dead bodies and tortured people and</text>
  <text start="1625.79" dur="6.9">some pretty gruesome things but it was</text>
  <text start="1629.9" dur="5.07">interesting how I came to the awareness</text>
  <text start="1632.69" dur="3.9">that I had some parts that needed</text>
  <text start="1634.97" dur="4.38">healing the Lord actually gave me a</text>
  <text start="1636.59" dur="5.13">dream and in the dream I saw two</text>
  <text start="1639.35" dur="5.01">versions of me one was an outgoing</text>
  <text start="1641.72" dur="4.74">gregarious person who you know liked</text>
  <text start="1644.36" dur="4.29">hanging out with people and the other</text>
  <text start="1646.46" dur="7.35">version of me was hiding in a cave and</text>
  <text start="1648.65" dur="6.87">was a recluse and they met the the</text>
  <text start="1653.81" dur="4.65">outgoing one went into the cave and he</text>
  <text start="1655.52" dur="5.22">was talking to the the recluse version</text>
  <text start="1658.46" dur="4.89">of me and was trying to coax him to come</text>
  <text start="1660.74" dur="5.64">out of the cave and this dream was oh</text>
  <text start="1663.35" dur="4.71">gosh a couple years ago and it was right</text>
  <text start="1666.38" dur="3.03">about the time I was starting to learn</text>
  <text start="1668.06" dur="5.28">more about emotional healing and I</text>
  <text start="1669.41" dur="7.65">thought oh mmm something&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="1673.34" dur="6">so I found out they&amp;#39;re doing ministry</text>
  <text start="1677.06" dur="5.1">with a friend of mine that I had an</text>
  <text start="1679.34" dur="4.65">altar that needed to be healed and</text>
  <text start="1682.16" dur="5.76">integrated and that was an interesting</text>
  <text start="1683.99" dur="8.07">process but well you know the terms that</text>
  <text start="1687.92" dur="6.15">we use altars parts fragments the core</text>
  <text start="1692.06" dur="4.17">can you talk a little bit about what</text>
  <text start="1694.07" dur="4.38">those terms mean for the person who</text>
  <text start="1696.23" dur="6.06">doesn&amp;#39;t really know much about them yeah</text>
  <text start="1698.45" dur="5.34">you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s interesting words and</text>
  <text start="1702.29" dur="3.42">terms because a lot of times for me I</text>
  <text start="1703.79" dur="4.2">want to find good little foundation for</text>
  <text start="1705.71" dur="4.55">everything even us we&amp;#39;re grappling with</text>
  <text start="1707.99" dur="6.69">what do you recall some of these</text>
  <text start="1710.26" dur="9.37">realities and some of these things so</text>
  <text start="1714.68" dur="7.5">but what the word altars means is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1719.63" dur="6.15">another part of who we are as what</text>
  <text start="1722.18" dur="7.16">ministering to someone it is them but in</text>
  <text start="1725.78" dur="7.98">a childhood trauma what takes place is</text>
  <text start="1729.34" dur="6.43">that a little child and there are breaks</text>
  <text start="1733.76" dur="3.36">for so many different reasons I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="1735.77" dur="4.74">to use it two different examples and</text>
  <text start="1737.12" dur="5.94">that&amp;#39;s okay one is a child is raped they</text>
  <text start="1740.51" dur="5.82">got to go to school the next day</text>
  <text start="1743.06" dur="8.24">and so what happens is that part of</text>
  <text start="1746.33" dur="8.82">their soul holds that memory and</text>
  <text start="1751.3" dur="6.82">fractures and they go to school and act</text>
  <text start="1755.15" dur="6.21">like nothing ever happened</text>
  <text start="1758.12" dur="6.66">they&amp;#39;re not acting it is like it was so</text>
  <text start="1761.36" dur="6.15">traumatizing that they aren&amp;#39;t able as a</text>
  <text start="1764.78" dur="6.72">child to process that and it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="1767.51" dur="7.11">God&amp;#39;s grace that allows that I believe</text>
  <text start="1771.5" dur="4.68">so that the child doesn&amp;#39;t live 24/7</text>
  <text start="1774.62" dur="4.02">there are children that go through this</text>
  <text start="1776.18" dur="5.37">on a daily basis now the interesting</text>
  <text start="1778.64" dur="6.09">thing is I&amp;#39;ve seen parts that they broke</text>
  <text start="1781.55" dur="7.05">there was one dear friend of ours and</text>
  <text start="1784.73" dur="5.64">got ministry and there was a woman and</text>
  <text start="1788.6" dur="4.86">also we were talking about two five year</text>
  <text start="1790.37" dur="5.85">old boy and I was like okay this is kind</text>
  <text start="1793.46" dur="4.77">of strange why is this part of a boy&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1796.22" dur="4.32">name because usually girls parts have</text>
  <text start="1798.23" dur="3.42">girls names guys are parts I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="1800.54" dur="3.69">there&amp;#39;s going to be something really</text>
  <text start="1801.65" dur="6.42">weird sexual anon no let&amp;#39;s just five</text>
  <text start="1804.23" dur="5.97">years old mom had had it with all the</text>

  <text start="1816.95" dur="5.01">like I&amp;#39;m locked out of my house it was</text>
  <text start="1819.71" dur="3.78">like a five year olds perspective on</text>
  <text start="1821.96" dur="3.84">what just happened and I can&amp;#39;t imagine</text>
  <text start="1823.49" dur="5.13">how many moms have done the same thing</text>
  <text start="1825.8" dur="4.62">you know that I&amp;#39;ve had enough you guys</text>

  <text start="1832.7" dur="5.58">I felt this abject abandonment in the</text>
  <text start="1835.82" dur="4.83">moment and and then she said to herself</text>
  <text start="1838.28" dur="5.91">the boys get to play with sticks and</text>
  <text start="1840.65" dur="6.72">climb trees I want to be a boy and I was</text>

  <text start="1860.33" dur="3.78">to do so I&amp;#39;m going to be a boy</text>
  <text start="1861.77" dur="6.02">it&amp;#39;s very interesting as you start</text>
  <text start="1864.11" dur="6.47">talking to these parts that this</text>
  <text start="1867.79" dur="5.94">go woman a friend of mine lives in a</text>
  <text start="1870.58" dur="5.1">nice part of the city one time I asked a</text>
  <text start="1873.73" dur="3.6">question or said something that she</text>
  <text start="1875.68" dur="3.63">didn&amp;#39;t like and because she was five</text>
  <text start="1877.33" dur="3.87">years old she&amp;#39;s reacting the things as</text>
  <text start="1879.31" dur="4.64">an adult you Iraqi and she goes I just</text>
  <text start="1881.2" dur="6.89">want to come over there and punch you</text>

  <text start="1888.09" dur="4.81">because it was you&amp;#39;re going through this</text>
  <text start="1890.44" dur="4.53">kind of ministry you still can respond</text>
  <text start="1892.9" dur="3.72">autosense she&amp;#39;s like Richard you know</text>
  <text start="1894.97" dur="3.51">that&amp;#39;s not me I would never say that I</text>
  <text start="1896.62" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t want to hit you I said I know I</text>

  <text start="1900.31" dur="5.7">talking in this five year old boy but it</text>
  <text start="1902.44" dur="6.48">all begin to make sense but trauma can</text>
  <text start="1906.01" dur="5.64">look so different we deal a lot with</text>
  <text start="1908.92" dur="5.1">pretty heavy broken mess there for</text>
  <text start="1911.65" dur="4.11">another dear friend of ours um she&amp;#39;d had</text>
  <text start="1914.02" dur="4.32">her mom died and then her brother died</text>
  <text start="1915.76" dur="4.26">with an 8-month they were all kind of</text>
  <text start="1918.34" dur="3.42">parts that fractured all different and</text>
  <text start="1920.02" dur="3.87">most of them had fear based all of our</text>
  <text start="1921.76" dur="3.99">physical illnesses were fear based God</text>
  <text start="1923.89" dur="4.14">has healed almost every one of her</text>
  <text start="1925.75" dur="4.77">physical illnesses to multiple chemical</text>
  <text start="1928.03" dur="4.08">sensitivity had to wear a mask couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1930.52" dur="3.15">go into the bathroom that work had to go</text>
  <text start="1932.11" dur="3.87">somewhere else to about them because the</text>
  <text start="1933.67" dur="5.1">soaps that they used all kinds of none</text>
  <text start="1935.98" dur="5.19">of that the as one the sinus problems</text>
  <text start="1938.77" dur="6.09">all of that field as we dealt with the</text>
  <text start="1941.17" dur="7.26">fear base um but it was a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="1944.86" dur="5.25">different parts hang on hang on yeah you</text>
  <text start="1948.43" dur="3.3">are on a roll and I have some things I</text>
  <text start="1950.11" dur="5.31">want to talk about I</text>
  <text start="1951.73" dur="5.7">I talked to people who operate in</text>
  <text start="1955.42" dur="4.44">emotional healing and physical healing</text>
  <text start="1957.43" dur="4.62">and one of the things that I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1959.86" dur="5.67">kind of learning and hearing from other</text>
  <text start="1962.05" dur="5.31">people is that if you have difficulty</text>
  <text start="1965.53" dur="4.59">getting somebody healed of what seems to</text>
  <text start="1967.36" dur="5.94">be a physical condition like autoimmune</text>
  <text start="1970.12" dur="5.58">or environmental sensitivity or illness</text>
  <text start="1973.3" dur="4.5">things of that nature it seems like</text>
  <text start="1975.7" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s almost always an emotional</text>
  <text start="1977.8" dur="6">trauma that needs to be healed first</text>
  <text start="1981.1" dur="5.07">because typical exercising Authority</text>
  <text start="1983.8" dur="4.44">releasing power just doesn&amp;#39;t work on</text>
  <text start="1986.17" dur="4.02">those people if you go in and find out</text>
  <text start="1988.24" dur="5.16">where the emotional trauma is that get</text>
  <text start="1990.19" dur="4.86">the parts of the soul healed I&amp;#39;m hearing</text>
  <text start="1993.4" dur="3.63">from people they have much better</text>
  <text start="1995.05" dur="3.84">success getting those people healed</text>
  <text start="1997.03" dur="4.53">after they do the emotional healing yeah</text>
  <text start="1998.89" dur="4.83">into a setting as many times</text>
  <text start="2001.56" dur="3.84">in churches and that they&amp;#39;re in a faith</text>
  <text start="2003.72" dur="3.96">churches that they need more faith is</text>
  <text start="2005.4" dur="4.77">there you know and and they&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2007.68" dur="4.2">claiming it and praying for it</text>
  <text start="2010.17" dur="4.56">everybody&amp;#39;s praying for the symptoms and</text>
  <text start="2011.88" dur="6.75">no one ever looks at the possibility of</text>
  <text start="2014.73" dur="6.38">their even being a route and so you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2018.63" dur="6.48">hitting the nail on the head it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2021.11" dur="6.39">intertwined it faith is huge key it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2025.11" dur="6.38">very important key it&amp;#39;s not the only key</text>
  <text start="2027.5" dur="6.4">you make a reference to the tools and</text>
  <text start="2031.49" dur="5.02">that&amp;#39;s one of my favorite analogies is</text>
  <text start="2033.9" dur="5.97">the tool belt God has given us a lot of</text>
  <text start="2036.51" dur="5.49">tools for ministry he has given us</text>
  <text start="2039.87" dur="5.16">authority and we can exercise authority</text>
  <text start="2042" dur="5.85">over demons he&amp;#39;s given us power we can</text>
  <text start="2045.03" dur="6.39">release power to work miracles he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2047.85" dur="6.06">given us emotional healing we can get</text>
  <text start="2051.42" dur="4.44">Jesus into this dynamic where he heals</text>
  <text start="2053.91" dur="4.08">the broken parts of the soul he has</text>
  <text start="2055.86" dur="3.84">given us his presence when we released</text>
  <text start="2057.99" dur="3.78">God&amp;#39;s presence comes and he can do</text>
  <text start="2059.7" dur="4.29">miracles and us not even pray or release</text>
  <text start="2061.77" dur="4.08">power authority he&amp;#39;s given us words of</text>
  <text start="2063.99" dur="5.43">knowledge he&amp;#39;s given us things of that</text>
  <text start="2065.85" dur="5.67">nature and what what I&amp;#39;ve found is if</text>
  <text start="2069.42" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re not familiar with all the tools</text>
  <text start="2071.52" dur="4.71">you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;ll have a very difficult time</text>
  <text start="2073.92" dur="4.02">getting a lot of people healed because</text>
  <text start="2076.23" dur="3.18">if your only tool is a hammer everything</text>
  <text start="2077.94" dur="4.32">looks like a nail</text>
  <text start="2079.41" dur="5.34">and if you&amp;#39;re just told it&amp;#39;s all about</text>
  <text start="2082.26" dur="3.87">faith just got to have more faith well</text>
  <text start="2084.75" dur="2.58">that doesn&amp;#39;t give people a lot of hope</text>
  <text start="2086.13" dur="4.29">for getting healed if they just well I</text>
  <text start="2087.33" dur="8.19">have faith but you know not again Neal</text>
  <text start="2090.42" dur="7.89">yeah absolutely and I I find that</text>
  <text start="2095.52" dur="6.51">whenever I get to add a new key all of a</text>
  <text start="2098.31" dur="5.97">sudden certain things that where we had</text>
  <text start="2102.03" dur="4.2">run into roadblocks now we begin to see</text>
  <text start="2104.28" dur="5.37">you know I want to call up everybody</text>
  <text start="2106.23" dur="6.81">that used to get ministry and go I have</text>
  <text start="2109.65" dur="4.26">a new key and I know this because yeah</text>
  <text start="2113.04" dur="3.27">exactly</text>
  <text start="2113.91" dur="4.14">for years I actually resisted what we</text>
  <text start="2116.31" dur="4.77">call broken soul ministry today because</text>
  <text start="2118.05" dur="5.04">the people that I found that we&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2121.08" dur="3.78">it couldn&amp;#39;t give me some answers that</text>
  <text start="2123.09" dur="3.38">were important you wanted I never felt</text>
  <text start="2124.86" dur="4.74">like they gave us good biblical</text>
  <text start="2126.47" dur="5.98">foundation for it the other thing is I</text>
  <text start="2129.6" dur="4.32">felt like when I would talk to them they</text>
  <text start="2132.45" dur="3.09">they would talk like they were</text>
  <text start="2133.92" dur="3.45">authorities but they were talking about</text>
  <text start="2135.54" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;ve been working this person 15 years</text>
  <text start="2137.37" dur="3.87">and we&amp;#39;re almost at the point of</text>
  <text start="2138.72" dur="4.83">breakthrough and I&amp;#39;m going I know the</text>
  <text start="2141.24" dur="5.91">words bigger than that these were some</text>
  <text start="2143.55" dur="8.13">decent-size ministries and supposed</text>
  <text start="2147.15" dur="5.82">experts in this field and I was like God</text>
  <text start="2151.68" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;m willing to work with someone as long</text>
  <text start="2152.97" dur="9.24">as it takes but if they don&amp;#39;t have fruit</text>
  <text start="2156.42" dur="9.21">yet then I don&amp;#39;t want to copy what</text>
  <text start="2162.21" dur="5.28">they&amp;#39;re doing exactly it took a while</text>
  <text start="2165.63" dur="4.74">before I found people that I felt we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2167.49" dur="5.19">having the kind of fruit I would expect</text>
  <text start="2170.37" dur="4.23">and you know we&amp;#39;re applying these</text>
  <text start="2172.68" dur="4.59">principles in a way that it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2174.6" dur="5.49">effective and healthy yeah I&amp;#39;m with you</text>
  <text start="2177.27" dur="4.8">I love to learn from people who are</text>
  <text start="2180.09" dur="3.33">having good success and who are getting</text>
  <text start="2182.07" dur="3.6">breakthrough in areas that no one else</text>
  <text start="2183.42" dur="3.99">is like there are some people that are</text>
  <text start="2185.67" dur="3.45">really good at you know physical healing</text>
  <text start="2187.41" dur="5.4">and that&amp;#39;s great nothing wrong with that</text>
  <text start="2189.12" dur="6.51">you can learn from those people but what</text>
  <text start="2192.81" dur="5.28">about people who are you know how&amp;#39;s your</text>
  <text start="2195.63" dur="4.38">record on autoimmune or how many people</text>
  <text start="2198.09" dur="4.71">have you seen healed of MS or Lou</text>
  <text start="2200.01" dur="5.19">Gehrig&amp;#39;s disease those difficult things</text>
  <text start="2202.8" dur="4.68">you know people will run into they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2205.2" dur="3.51">get the 80% success rate on healing and</text>
  <text start="2207.48" dur="3.24">then go well you know we can&amp;#39;t get this</text>
  <text start="2208.71" dur="4.14">yielding cake at that heal then my</text>
  <text start="2210.72" dur="3.72">question is why what what are you what</text>
  <text start="2212.85" dur="4.8">are we missing that we can&amp;#39;t get those</text>
  <text start="2214.44" dur="4.62">conditions healed when I look around I</text>
  <text start="2217.65" dur="3.51">see other people who are having good</text>
  <text start="2219.06" dur="3.78">success or some success in that area and</text>
  <text start="2221.16" dur="3.36">go okay what are you guys doing well</text>
  <text start="2222.84" dur="3.21">they have a different approach they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2224.52" dur="3.75">added some different tools they have a</text>
  <text start="2226.05" dur="4.14">different understanding God&amp;#39;s shown them</text>
  <text start="2228.27" dur="4.62">specific things whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2230.19" dur="5.58">generational issues or emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="2232.89" dur="5.7">and you know generational issues is a</text>
  <text start="2235.77" dur="5.4">good example I have like zero experience</text>
  <text start="2238.59" dur="6.27">with generational healing</text>
  <text start="2241.17" dur="5.61">I have no revelation from God on it and</text>
  <text start="2244.86" dur="3.93">I&amp;#39;ve had you know hundreds of Dreams</text>
  <text start="2246.78" dur="4.02">where God has shown me different aspects</text>
  <text start="2248.79" dur="5.1">of healing but he&amp;#39;s never spoken to me</text>
  <text start="2250.8" dur="4.65">about generational issues but he had</text>
  <text start="2253.89" dur="3.27">spoken to a lot of my friends about it</text>
  <text start="2255.45" dur="3.75">and I have friends who have really good</text>
  <text start="2257.16" dur="3.93">success with generational things and</text>
  <text start="2259.2" dur="4.17">then I have people like you and Steve</text>
  <text start="2261.09" dur="4.44">who are really going after you know SRA</text>
  <text start="2263.37" dur="4.35">and D ID and emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="2265.53" dur="3.07">I like to find those people that are</text>
  <text start="2267.72" dur="2.59">having success</text>
  <text start="2268.6" dur="4.53">either learn what they&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="2270.31" dur="4.53">learn how to do it myself or have a</text>
  <text start="2273.13" dur="4.38">resource where I can refer people to</text>
  <text start="2274.84" dur="4.53">them and I refer a lot of people out to</text>
  <text start="2277.51" dur="3.21">other ministers who are having success</text>
  <text start="2279.37" dur="5.16">with stuff that I&amp;#39;m just not having</text>
  <text start="2280.72" dur="5.94">success with awesome so I want to talk a</text>
  <text start="2284.53" dur="5.19">little bit more about you know the parts</text>
  <text start="2286.66" dur="4.98">because this gosh this is such an</text>
  <text start="2289.72" dur="3.48">interesting subject for me and for a lot</text>
  <text start="2291.64" dur="5.43">of my listeners that found people to</text>
  <text start="2293.2" dur="5.97">follow my podcast the emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="2297.07" dur="4.02">and fragments and altars and those</text>
  <text start="2299.17" dur="5.85">discussions are some of them most</text>
  <text start="2301.09" dur="6.24">I get more questions and those programs</text>
  <text start="2305.02" dur="4.2">tend to get more listens and downloads</text>
  <text start="2307.33" dur="3.39">than any other program because people</text>
  <text start="2309.22" dur="4.2">are really hungry to learn about this</text>
  <text start="2310.72" dur="4.98">now when you&amp;#39;re doing ministry to</text>
  <text start="2313.42" dur="3.72">somebody who&amp;#39;s got you know for what do</text>
  <text start="2315.7" dur="3.48">you call them fragments or altars or</text>
  <text start="2317.14" dur="4.14">parts I think parts is a good term</text>
  <text start="2319.18" dur="3.75">because it&amp;#39;s hard to make that</text>
  <text start="2321.28" dur="4.38">distinction between well this is an</text>
  <text start="2322.93" dur="5.34">altar and this is a fragment some people</text>
  <text start="2325.66" dur="5.46">make that distinction but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2328.27" dur="4.32">kind of a gray area but you you seems</text>
  <text start="2331.12" dur="2.76">like you generally refer to them just as</text>
  <text start="2332.59" dur="3.95">parts yeah</text>
  <text start="2333.88" dur="4.77">when you&amp;#39;re doing ministry to a</text>
  <text start="2336.54" dur="4.72">fragmented or broken part of the soul</text>
  <text start="2338.65" dur="6.15">like you just discussed this as this</text>
  <text start="2341.26" dur="6.36">fragment or this part came up and was</text>
  <text start="2344.8" dur="5.22">talking like a five-year-old boy is that</text>
  <text start="2347.62" dur="5.13">typically for you how this happens the</text>
  <text start="2350.02" dur="5.76">the wounded part of the soldiers comes</text>
  <text start="2352.75" dur="4.53">up takes over starts talking and you</text>
  <text start="2355.78" dur="2.91">just have it a normal discussion with</text>
  <text start="2357.28" dur="3.69">them can you talk us through a little</text>
  <text start="2358.69" dur="4.11">bit of that it&amp;#39;s interesting is in my</text>
  <text start="2360.97" dur="3.81">whole journey I&amp;#39;ve been exposed to a lot</text>
  <text start="2362.8" dur="3.87">of different people initially things for</text>
  <text start="2364.78" dur="4.26">people and I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot of</text>
  <text start="2366.67" dur="6.72">different systems but for whatever</text>
  <text start="2369.04" dur="8.9">wheeze and the Lord has used us in in</text>
  <text start="2373.39" dur="8.16">ways where it has to be so spirit Len</text>
  <text start="2377.94" dur="5.95">that what I did yesterday if the same</text>
  <text start="2381.55" dur="3.33">thing happens today and the Spirit tells</text>
  <text start="2383.89" dur="4.83">me to go a different way we go a</text>
  <text start="2384.88" dur="6.78">different way so Ian how parts manifest</text>
  <text start="2388.72" dur="6.54">it varies sometimes what happens as we</text>
  <text start="2391.66" dur="6.6">begin we do a super simple prayer and</text>
  <text start="2395.26" dur="5.97">again I&amp;#39;m not giving anybody this set</text>
  <text start="2398.26" dur="3.93">for a formula to copy with it but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2401.23" dur="4.43">just kind of</text>
  <text start="2402.19" dur="5.79">just first I pray for the core but the</text>
  <text start="2405.66" dur="4.39">main part of soon will just be a piece</text>
  <text start="2407.98" dur="6.12">at rest they will be able to relax and</text>
  <text start="2410.05" dur="6.66">not feel the need to take over not not</text>
  <text start="2414.1" dur="4.46">feel the need to do anything I explained</text>
  <text start="2416.71" dur="5.19">all this to them even before we pray and</text>
  <text start="2418.56" dur="6.31">then I pray that God would make a clear</text>
  <text start="2421.9" dur="5.04">distinction between any parts that that</text>
  <text start="2424.87" dur="5.52">he wants to minister to in the core so</text>
  <text start="2426.94" dur="6.36">that they know this is not me this is</text>
  <text start="2430.39" dur="4.95">the part of my soul and if the order let</text>
  <text start="2433.3" dur="3.9">them know this is safe we are safe</text>
  <text start="2435.34" dur="4.17">because a lot of times different parts</text>
  <text start="2437.2" dur="8.76">that they would know people are going to</text>
  <text start="2439.51" dur="8.34">label us like crazy if we talk they may</text>
  <text start="2445.96" dur="3.51">have been threatened by people some what</text>
  <text start="2447.85" dur="3.51">the woman&amp;#39;s been raped and she&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2449.47" dur="4.41">threatened a lot of times even if she</text>
  <text start="2451.36" dur="5.67">doesn&amp;#39;t remember that partly members the</text>
  <text start="2453.88" dur="6.75">curette and that&amp;#39;s why she&amp;#39;s not talked</text>
  <text start="2457.03" dur="6.96">about those experiences and sometimes</text>
  <text start="2460.63" dur="6.06">the parts get threatened by demons right</text>
  <text start="2463.99" dur="4.41">so that&amp;#39;s another issue so you know my</text>
  <text start="2466.69" dur="5.01">prayer is that they would know that they</text>
  <text start="2468.4" dur="5.52">are safe there&amp;#39;s no ability of the enemy</text>
  <text start="2471.7" dur="3.69">to retaliate then I pray against on</text>
  <text start="2473.92" dur="2.76">demonic that&amp;#39;s been attached to any</text>
  <text start="2475.39" dur="3.99">parts that the Lord would bind it</text>
  <text start="2476.68" dur="5.82">chained it but the parts could even see</text>
  <text start="2479.38" dur="5.13">what the Lord does to these parts but</text>
  <text start="2482.5" dur="3.72">they could see that they are safe but</text>
  <text start="2484.51" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s a distance that the word is</text>
  <text start="2486.22" dur="5.7">chained them in Bhama because sometimes</text>
  <text start="2488.26" dur="5.25">the demonic still has rights but we just</text>
  <text start="2491.92" dur="4.17">pray that they&amp;#39;re not able to hinder the</text>
  <text start="2493.51" dur="5.97">ministry in any way not able to talk or</text>
  <text start="2496.09" dur="5.73">do anything that during our ministry</text>
  <text start="2499.48" dur="5.37">time and and afterwards I&amp;#39;ll pray for</text>
  <text start="2501.82" dur="5.76">them as well and the last thing we do is</text>
  <text start="2504.85" dur="4.71">just say Lord Jesus whoever but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2507.58" dur="5.22">a part you want to minister to today I</text>
  <text start="2509.56" dur="4.65">pray that you allow us to minister that</text>
  <text start="2512.8" dur="5.49">part and I&amp;#39;ve learned to say not just</text>
  <text start="2514.21" dur="7.08">part but any parts or part because one</text>
  <text start="2518.29" dur="6.21">of the things that I found yesterday we</text>
  <text start="2521.29" dur="7.08">had two people that we saw a lot of</text>
  <text start="2524.5" dur="6.36">parts merged and healed and it was</text>
  <text start="2528.37" dur="5.07">almost like we were preaching to a crowd</text>
  <text start="2530.86" dur="6.18">of parts a lot of fracturing had taken</text>
  <text start="2533.44" dur="6.27">place in both of their lives due to SRA</text>
  <text start="2537.04" dur="4.02">type stuff I was like thank you God that</text>
  <text start="2539.71" dur="3.87">we didn&amp;#39;t have to talk to everyone I</text>
  <text start="2541.06" dur="4.62">mean one on one that is very interesting</text>
  <text start="2543.58" dur="3.99">that&amp;#39;s why I can&amp;#39;t say the word typical</text>
  <text start="2545.68" dur="3.9">because there&amp;#39;s times that it&amp;#39;s a part</text>
  <text start="2547.57" dur="3.9">that begins to speak to other parts</text>
  <text start="2549.58" dur="4.56">sometimes it&amp;#39;s the core begins to speak</text>
  <text start="2551.47" dur="5.58">to the parts I never really know what</text>
  <text start="2554.14" dur="6.3">they did have a good like usual was a</text>
  <text start="2557.05" dur="6.48">part began to speak to the core because</text>
  <text start="2560.44" dur="5.82">the core was struggling with where was</text>
  <text start="2563.53" dur="4.56">Jesus when thought this traumatic thing</text>
  <text start="2566.26" dur="4.98">took place and the part had already</text>
  <text start="2568.09" dur="6.54">gotten healing and and an elk I remember</text>
  <text start="2571.24" dur="5.88">the the core the Lord had led us to have</text>
  <text start="2574.63" dur="4.08">the core talk to that part and so then</text>
  <text start="2577.12" dur="3.27">the parts going why are you having</text>
  <text start="2578.71" dur="4.14">trouble believing the very same stuff</text>
  <text start="2580.39" dur="5.13">that you just told me and she was like</text>
  <text start="2582.85" dur="4.41">oh my gosh how come I can believe it</text>
  <text start="2585.52" dur="5.52">through this part of myself but I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2587.26" dur="6.51">believe it to me and major breakthrough</text>
  <text start="2591.04" dur="4.62">came and I was like there&amp;#39;s other times</text>
  <text start="2593.77" dur="5.58">that the Lord has me preaching to the</text>
  <text start="2595.66" dur="6.75">parts and that&amp;#39;s because and people may</text>
  <text start="2599.35" dur="6.74">not understand this but each part of the</text>
  <text start="2602.41" dur="6.06">soul has a different belief system yep</text>
  <text start="2606.09" dur="6.13">they&amp;#39;re there they&amp;#39;re a unique</text>
  <text start="2608.47" dur="6.48">individual soul with preferences likes</text>
  <text start="2612.22" dur="5.22">dislikes personality belief systems in</text>
  <text start="2614.95" dur="4.77">it and it&amp;#39;s not all through the same</text>
  <text start="2617.44" dur="3.33">throughout the entire soul and that is</text>
  <text start="2619.72" dur="2.79">something that kind of people have a</text>
  <text start="2620.77" dur="2.25">little bit of a hard time with some of</text>
  <text start="2622.51" dur="3">the parts</text>
  <text start="2623.02" dur="5.52">know Jesus and like Jesus other parts</text>
  <text start="2625.51" dur="4.8">hate Jesus and there were that dynamic a</text>
  <text start="2628.54" dur="4.5">deal we&amp;#39;re talking about now sounds</text>
  <text start="2630.31" dur="5.67">crazy the first time you begin to hear</text>
  <text start="2633.04" dur="6.42">something like this when you watch the</text>
  <text start="2635.98" dur="5.25">ministry take place it is beautiful when</text>
  <text start="2639.46" dur="4.23">we see the fruit of transformation in</text>
  <text start="2641.23" dur="5.13">someone&amp;#39;s life it&amp;#39;s beautiful but yeah</text>
  <text start="2643.69" dur="4.2">we talk about it on a kind of consistent</text>
  <text start="2646.36" dur="3.18">basis but I cannot talk about it to my</text>
  <text start="2647.89" dur="4.98">neighbors I don&amp;#39;t talk about it to many</text>
  <text start="2649.54" dur="5.94">pastors that I hang out with not right</text>
  <text start="2652.87" dur="4.86">off the bat you know I&amp;#39;ll update people</text>

  <text start="2848.61" dur="6.9">Lord gives nobody could have made it up</text>
  <text start="2851.64" dur="6.6">nobody can hat we don&amp;#39;t meet with a</text>
  <text start="2855.51" dur="5.28">thousand people in a two-year period of</text>
  <text start="2858.24" dur="5.28">time who all are experts on names and</text>
  <text start="2860.79" dur="6.36">can come up with the amazing name it</text>
  <text start="2863.52" dur="6.18">just happens it&amp;#39;s amazing when you look</text>
  <text start="2867.15" dur="5.46">in Revelation it says - he who overcomes</text>
  <text start="2869.7" dur="5.94">I&amp;#39;ll give a white stone on which is</text>
  <text start="2872.61" dur="5.55">written a name that no one knows the</text>

  <text start="2878.16" dur="5.79">he is it all through the Bible oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2882" dur="4.05">uncanny what the percentage of people in</text>
  <text start="2883.95" dur="4.98">the Bible that we know about who had</text>
  <text start="2886.05" dur="6.93">main changes yeah do you find that most</text>
  <text start="2888.93" dur="7.89">of the parts of live in the past yeah</text>
  <text start="2892.98" dur="5.76">what we often witness in parts like as</text>
  <text start="2896.82" dur="3.99">we do ministry let&amp;#39;s say that it broke</text>
  <text start="2898.74" dur="4.71">in around five and that&amp;#39;s the first</text>
  <text start="2900.81" dur="3.87">memory that begins to come up and parts</text>
  <text start="2903.45" dur="3.2">of manifest in different ways sometimes</text>
  <text start="2904.68" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s a memory sometimes it&amp;#39;s a feeling</text>
  <text start="2906.65" dur="4.69">sometimes there&amp;#39;s no memory and I love</text>
  <text start="2909.33" dur="5.13">that even especially there&amp;#39;s time that</text>
  <text start="2911.34" dur="6.42">we&amp;#39;re dealing with SRA and there&amp;#39;s major</text>
  <text start="2914.46" dur="5.94">feeling and there&amp;#39;s a knowledge and the</text>
  <text start="2917.76" dur="4.74">age and I see Lord what do you want to</text>
  <text start="2920.4" dur="4.47">do is there a memory you want to heal or</text>
  <text start="2922.5" dur="4.83">and the Lord just begins to be seal and</text>
  <text start="2924.87" dur="5.22">speak over them and never is a memory</text>
  <text start="2927.33" dur="5.22">brought to light and I&amp;#39;m like thank you</text>
  <text start="2930.09" dur="3.84">God because I know in my spirit</text>
  <text start="2932.55" dur="2.87">sometimes what it is that you might be</text>
  <text start="2933.93" dur="4.07">dealing with</text>
  <text start="2935.42" dur="5.28">and the person doesn&amp;#39;t even get a</text>
  <text start="2938" dur="4.5">revelation of what that memory was they</text>
  <text start="2940.7" dur="5.849">just all of a sudden go from</text>
  <text start="2942.5" dur="6.539">hopelessness to did you I have no more</text>
  <text start="2946.549" dur="6.57">some people do do this type of ministry</text>
  <text start="2949.039" dur="7.32">almost always require a memory to have</text>
  <text start="2953.119" dur="4.861">to surface and and I always put that</text>
  <text start="2956.359" dur="4.861">back in the Lord&amp;#39;s hand because</text>
  <text start="2957.98" dur="5.7">sometimes God for whatever reason and</text>
  <text start="2961.22" dur="4.319">there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s various reasons healing</text>
  <text start="2963.68" dur="4.08">from that memory is important and often</text>
  <text start="2965.539" dur="5.04">some of those memories that are really</text>
  <text start="2967.76" dur="4.65">traumatic the person did not have an</text>
  <text start="2970.579" dur="4.95">awareness so most of the time there is</text>
  <text start="2972.41" dur="4.08">some awareness and it we know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2975.529" dur="2.941">not we&amp;#39;re not dealing with false</text>
  <text start="2976.49" dur="3.51">memories we always ask the Lord or</text>
  <text start="2978.47" dur="3.329">movement if something begins to surface</text>
  <text start="2980" dur="3.66">in it and we just say Lord this is a</text>
  <text start="2981.799" dur="4.32">false memory we present you would take</text>
  <text start="2983.66" dur="5.909">it away if it&amp;#39;s false and go if it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="2989.569" dur="3.691">times there&amp;#39;s evidence in the person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2991.01" dur="4.349">life of some type of trauma if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2993.26" dur="3.72">no memories they don&amp;#39;t have any memories</text>
  <text start="2995.359" dur="4.111">from before they&amp;#39;re twelve years of age</text>
  <text start="2996.98" dur="6.059">you know when when the Lord begins to</text>
  <text start="2999.47" dur="5.46">surface those traumas it&amp;#39;s usually very</text>
  <text start="3003.039" dur="4.5">commensurate with what has been going on</text>
  <text start="3004.93" dur="4.679">in their life the type of trauma that</text>
  <text start="3007.539" dur="6.06">would have caused the issues that they</text>
  <text start="3009.609" dur="6.68">are battling with I&amp;#39;ve found that when a</text>
  <text start="3013.599" dur="5.73">person has significant and nisha</text>
  <text start="3016.289" dur="5.201">especially during childhood that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3019.329" dur="6.091">a strong likelihood that they have</text>
  <text start="3021.49" dur="7.2">suffered significant trauma and what I</text>
  <text start="3025.42" dur="5.58">what I&amp;#39;ve found is the worst the amnesia</text>
  <text start="3028.69" dur="4.2">is the fewer memories they have the more</text>
  <text start="3031" dur="3.569">blank spots they have when they look</text>
  <text start="3032.89" dur="5.1">back at their life the worst the trauma</text>
  <text start="3034.569" dur="4.861">probably is that and when I started out</text>
  <text start="3037.99" dur="4.379">doing this I was always trying to get</text>
  <text start="3039.43" dur="4.47">people to remember the event and you run</text>
  <text start="3042.369" dur="3.801">into these people who have amnesia and</text>
  <text start="3043.9" dur="5.28">what they have is they can feel emotions</text>
  <text start="3046.17" dur="4.72">but they don&amp;#39;t have an event they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3049.18" dur="4.649">have a memory of the event they just</text>
  <text start="3050.89" dur="4.35">know I feel this deep despair and</text>
  <text start="3053.829" dur="4.02">hopelessness but they don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3055.24" dur="4.17">causing it when I found many times that</text>
  <text start="3057.849" dur="3.42">what the Lord will do is without</text>
  <text start="3059.41" dur="4.56">bringing up the memory he&amp;#39;ll just heal</text>
  <text start="3061.269" dur="5.1">the emotion yeah and don&amp;#39;t never recall</text>
  <text start="3063.97" dur="5.61">the event well I prefer it when that</text>
  <text start="3066.369" dur="5.071">happens but I know sometimes that memory</text>
  <text start="3069.58" dur="4.14">is important for various reasons so</text>
  <text start="3071.44" dur="4.29">right and sometimes that all I do is I</text>
  <text start="3073.72" dur="5.1">had this one gal that I was working with</text>
  <text start="3075.73" dur="4.8">she had been a sexually assaulted at a</text>
  <text start="3078.82" dur="5.34">very young age I think she was like 2</text>
  <text start="3080.53" dur="6.57">years old now by her father and she had</text>
  <text start="3084.16" dur="4.95">no memory she just had this emotion of</text>
  <text start="3087.1" dur="3.69">terror and horror and she didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3089.11" dur="4.34">what it was attached to and I said well</text>
  <text start="3090.79" dur="6.27">if I&amp;#39;m just gonna ask the Holy Spirit to</text>
  <text start="3093.45" dur="6.1">show you the event if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3097.06" dur="5.07">important for you to remember it and she</text>
  <text start="3099.55" dur="5.91">saw this event which she had no memory</text>
  <text start="3102.13" dur="5.22">of up until that point and she felt the</text>
  <text start="3105.46" dur="4.17">emotion and then the Lord healed the</text>
  <text start="3107.35" dur="4.92">emotion but it is interesting that</text>
  <text start="3109.63" dur="4.35">sometimes he&amp;#39;ll give them the memory of</text>
  <text start="3112.27" dur="4.38">the event and sometimes you won&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="3113.98" dur="4.11">guess for people listening don&amp;#39;t get too</text>
  <text start="3116.65" dur="2.91">hung up on whether the person can</text>
  <text start="3118.09" dur="3.48">remember the event or not it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3119.56" dur="4.02">always important if the Lord wants them</text>
  <text start="3121.57" dur="4.2">to he can you know bring it to their</text>
  <text start="3123.58" dur="4.62">memory if not then it&amp;#39;s probably not</text>
  <text start="3125.77" dur="5.25">important can you talk a little bit</text>
  <text start="3128.2" dur="5.43">about rejection of parts and how</text>
  <text start="3131.02" dur="5.1">sometimes the core of the personality</text>
  <text start="3133.63" dur="5.43">will sometimes reject the parts have you</text>
  <text start="3136.12" dur="5.55">seen much of that yeah it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="3139.06" dur="5.24">because um a couple of times that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3141.67" dur="6">seen that have been actually people that</text>
  <text start="3144.3" dur="7.69">ended up hospitalized before they came</text>
  <text start="3147.67" dur="7.38">to us and one of the factors behind that</text>
  <text start="3151.99" dur="4.8">is of what I&amp;#39;m witness and this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3155.05" dur="2.76">always the case but a couple just popped</text>
  <text start="3156.79" dur="3.42">in my head as soon as you asked that</text>
  <text start="3157.81" dur="4.38">question where because the part really</text>
  <text start="3160.21" dur="4.53">wanted to deal with a memory and the</text>
  <text start="3162.19" dur="5.19">core didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with it and and</text>
  <text start="3164.74" dur="4.2">there are different parts of different</text>
  <text start="3167.38" dur="4.07">people have different terms sometimes</text>
  <text start="3168.94" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s a primary break that happened at</text>
  <text start="3171.45" dur="4">childhood different people call it</text>
  <text start="3173.44" dur="5.79">different things I&amp;#39;ve heard it called</text>
  <text start="3175.45" dur="7.11">the flipside the twin and it has unique</text>
  <text start="3179.23" dur="6.48">characteristics but sometimes that part</text>
  <text start="3182.56" dur="6">especially is a more dominant part in a</text>
  <text start="3185.71" dur="5.82">lot of people and so in this case</text>
  <text start="3188.56" dur="5.57">because the core personality didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="3191.53" dur="5.4">to deal with it that part was really</text>
  <text start="3194.13" dur="3.37">exerting its influence and so she&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="3196.93" dur="1.86">the hospital</text>
  <text start="3197.5" dur="5.73">and they had three different charts on</text>
  <text start="3198.79" dur="8.43">her with three different names and</text>
  <text start="3203.23" dur="8.28">so we end up we met the the core had a</text>
  <text start="3207.22" dur="6.86">name and then the primary break has had</text>
  <text start="3211.51" dur="6.96">almost the identical name but it was</text>
  <text start="3214.08" dur="7.45">just one letter difference and and it</text>
  <text start="3218.47" dur="6.09">was interesting because the core wanted</text>
  <text start="3221.53" dur="6.72">to argue and and believe that the that</text>
  <text start="3224.56" dur="8.52">primary break was liar and and must be</text>
  <text start="3228.25" dur="8.4">even demonic because when she was young</text>
  <text start="3233.08" dur="5.34">and her teens actually she had been had</text>
  <text start="3236.65" dur="4.8">a boyfriend that tried to molest her</text>
  <text start="3238.42" dur="6.26">well the the part of the primary part</text>
  <text start="3241.45" dur="5.76">that was fighting for this influence</text>
  <text start="3244.68" dur="5.23">called it a rape and she said I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3247.21" dur="5.46">raped he tried but he wasn&amp;#39;t successful</text>
  <text start="3249.91" dur="4.949">and so then I was like the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="3252.67" dur="3.99">just began to show me he&amp;#39;s like there</text>
  <text start="3254.859" dur="3.811">they both have the same experience and</text>
  <text start="3256.66" dur="5.13">both we describe it the same way but</text>
  <text start="3258.67" dur="5.37">both call it different things and so I</text>
  <text start="3261.79" dur="5.34">asked that that part I said I said when</text>
  <text start="3264.04" dur="5.91">you hear the primary talking about this</text>
  <text start="3267.13" dur="4.14">are the details accurate and she was</text>
  <text start="3269.95" dur="4.35">yeah the details are right I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="3271.27" dur="5.04">arguing with that but that is rape and I</text>
  <text start="3274.3" dur="5.069">said honestly technically to the core</text>
  <text start="3276.31" dur="4.23">and there&amp;#39;s a friend I said most</text>
  <text start="3279.369" dur="3.24">counselors would call what you</text>
  <text start="3280.54" dur="4.25">experienced rape even though you got</text>
  <text start="3282.609" dur="4.411">away from it I was like it is still</text>
  <text start="3284.79" dur="4.06">great and what you&amp;#39;re talking about</text>
  <text start="3287.02" dur="5.21">right now on what&amp;#39;s creating some major</text>
  <text start="3288.85" dur="7.11">wall between you and this part is</text>
  <text start="3292.23" dur="6.28">semantics right I mean it was it was a</text>
  <text start="3295.96" dur="6.33">violent traumatic event</text>
  <text start="3298.51" dur="7.349">yeah and so in the details of it are you</text>
  <text start="3302.29" dur="6.27">right or semantics and it&amp;#39;s strange how</text>
  <text start="3305.859" dur="4.801">you can sort of twist that to get your</text>
  <text start="3308.56" dur="2.25">way if you want to perceive it a certain</text>
  <text start="3310.66" dur="3.12">way</text>
  <text start="3310.81" dur="5.01">yeah and so it was it was a it was who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3313.78" dur="4.829">arguing with herself fighting with</text>
  <text start="3315.82" dur="5.67">herself over that incident and it took a</text>
  <text start="3318.609" dur="4.651">while for for her to even open up to</text>
  <text start="3321.49" dur="3.36">letting that part get ministry and get</text>
  <text start="3323.26" dur="3.69">healing because she was afraid it had</text>
  <text start="3324.85" dur="4.41">taken over and it had messed up so much</text>
  <text start="3326.95" dur="4.95">of her life but it was beautiful and</text>
  <text start="3329.26" dur="4.77">when the Lord healed that and reconcile</text>
  <text start="3331.9" dur="4.52">them and she was this isn&amp;#39;t a messed up</text>
  <text start="3334.03" dur="4.64">part she cares about me</text>
  <text start="3336.42" dur="5.369">and the Lord had done amazing work in</text>
  <text start="3338.67" dur="6.359">that part and let other people reject it</text>
  <text start="3341.789" dur="5.211">because they feel like if I if you find</text>
  <text start="3345.029" dur="4.921">a part in me then that means I&amp;#39;m crazy</text>
  <text start="3347" dur="5.049">and some of these people have had the</text>
  <text start="3349.95" dur="4.47">most messed up mixed up life but not</text>
  <text start="3352.049" dur="4.201">that they&amp;#39;re like so afraid if there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3354.42" dur="4.08">part of me that literally means that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3356.25" dur="5.01">really crazy I&amp;#39;m like I had parts and I</text>
  <text start="3358.5" dur="4.2">I would pass any psychological test you</text>
  <text start="3361.26" dur="4.019">know except for people that believe that</text>
  <text start="3362.7" dur="4.47">you hear voices you&amp;#39;re you know mentally</text>
  <text start="3365.279" dur="3.75">insane you know which I had a professor</text>
  <text start="3367.17" dur="4.379">in seminary that said anybody who said</text>
  <text start="3369.029" dur="6.211">they heard God speak to them needs</text>
  <text start="3371.549" dur="5.22">professional help so yeah people might</text>
  <text start="3375.24" dur="3.48">say I need professional help but other</text>
  <text start="3376.769" dur="4.59">than that you know I was right I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3378.72" dur="3.45">have any of those type of issues I got a</text>
  <text start="3381.359" dur="5.22">question for you</text>
  <text start="3382.17" dur="7.139">yeah I am the administrator of a group</text>
  <text start="3386.579" dur="7.081">on Facebook that is specifically for</text>
  <text start="3389.309" dur="6.411">people with D ID mmm and I&amp;#39;ve got I have</text>
  <text start="3393.66" dur="5.49">a lot of friends actually who have</text>
  <text start="3395.72" dur="5.02">multiples and one of my friends he would</text>
  <text start="3399.15" dur="3.32">call himself and I and everyone would</text>
  <text start="3400.74" dur="4.47">call him a very high-functioning</text>
  <text start="3402.47" dur="4.869">multiple he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s very aware of the of</text>
  <text start="3405.21" dur="6.389">his alters and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="3407.339" dur="6.96">interesting crew he is reluctant to go</text>
  <text start="3411.599" dur="5.67">through ministry I think it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="3414.299" dur="5.79">his alters don&amp;#39;t understand the process</text>
  <text start="3417.269" dur="5.78">but and I think they have a perception</text>
  <text start="3420.089" dur="5.75">that they&amp;#39;re going to cease to exist if</text>
  <text start="3423.049" dur="5.381">he goes through this process of</text>
  <text start="3425.839" dur="5.5">emotional healing what would you say to</text>
  <text start="3428.43" dur="4.439">someone who has the ID and is and their</text>
  <text start="3431.339" dur="3.811">altars are afraid that they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3432.869" dur="4.111">be annihilated or ceased to exist and</text>
  <text start="3435.15" dur="4.379">that&amp;#39;s why they don&amp;#39;t want to go through</text>
  <text start="3436.98" dur="4.41">this well first of all there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="3439.529" dur="6.27">that we do that&amp;#39;s against the will of</text>
  <text start="3441.39" dur="8.07">the alters there&amp;#39;s no manipulation</text>
  <text start="3445.799" dur="5.131">there&amp;#39;s no control there&amp;#39;s no ahahah</text>
  <text start="3449.46" dur="3.21">we&amp;#39;ve got you now we&amp;#39;re going to merge</text>
  <text start="3450.93" dur="6.119">you know you know it&amp;#39;s not how it</text>
  <text start="3452.67" dur="8.07">operates what I often invite them into</text>
  <text start="3457.049" dur="8.431">is deeply encounter with Jesus and a</text>
  <text start="3460.74" dur="6.869">trusting of him and and I go and I can</text>
  <text start="3465.48" dur="4.619">tell them unequivocally I&amp;#39;ve never seen</text>
  <text start="3467.609" dur="7.68">the Lord not gives up</text>
  <text start="3470.099" dur="10.67">part a more valuable and worthwhile name</text>
  <text start="3475.289" dur="11.06">and role but instead of now being a</text>
  <text start="3480.769" dur="8.77">fragmented so it&amp;#39;s more of United so and</text>
  <text start="3486.349" dur="7.541">that together you can accomplish more</text>
  <text start="3489.539" dur="6.181">than divided and that&amp;#39;s true of any</text>
  <text start="3493.89" dur="5.099">organization that&amp;#39;s true of any Church</text>
  <text start="3495.72" dur="4.289">it&amp;#39;s true of anything and the same is</text>
  <text start="3498.989" dur="4.08">true of a soul</text>
  <text start="3500.009" dur="5.28">but I said I said we&amp;#39;ve never merged a</text>
  <text start="3503.069" dur="3.901">part that didn&amp;#39;t want to be merged and</text>
  <text start="3505.289" dur="5.131">so I said if you&amp;#39;re willing to get some</text>
  <text start="3506.97" dur="4.98">ministry then at the point where that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3510.42" dur="4.439">a possibility</text>
  <text start="3511.95" dur="4.799">it&amp;#39;ll be what is the Lord want and what</text>
  <text start="3514.859" dur="4.291">you want and I&amp;#39;ve never had a part say</text>
  <text start="3516.749" dur="5.671">no way I&amp;#39;m not ready to go I don&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="3519.15" dur="5.399">that very few times is there&amp;#39;s I can</text>
  <text start="3522.42" dur="5.579">think of one off the top - off the top</text>
  <text start="3524.549" dur="6.78">of my head but the Lord put apart in one</text>
  <text start="3527.999" dur="5.641">position of like a century press for a</text>
  <text start="3531.329" dur="8.49">period of time and I don&amp;#39;t know why that</text>
  <text start="3533.64" dur="10.199">is those parts were often heavily to one</text>
  <text start="3539.819" dur="6.72">that kid hopeless bound up and now you</text>
  <text start="3543.839" dur="5.25">know they have a role and and feel very</text>
  <text start="3546.539" dur="4.68">competent and capable and rewarded</text>
  <text start="3549.089" dur="5.4">Helaman they&amp;#39;re so transformed it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3551.219" dur="7.64">incredible but but I have witnessed that</text>
  <text start="3554.489" dur="7.52">I think two times I have a friend who</text>
  <text start="3558.859" dur="6.791">she&amp;#39;s gosh she&amp;#39;s one of the oldest</text>

  <text start="3590.64" dur="4.079">integrated the Lord will give them</text>
  <text start="3592.799" dur="4.05">something a little higher standing a</text>
  <text start="3594.719" dur="4.77">little something more significant for</text>
  <text start="3596.849" dur="4.081">them to do until they&amp;#39;re ready to go to</text>
  <text start="3599.489" dur="4.621">the next step whatever the next step is</text>
  <text start="3600.93" dur="5.49">going to be yeah how do you introduce</text>
  <text start="3604.11" dur="6.24">Douce the parts to Jesus when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3606.42" dur="8.43">doing the ministry for me I do that</text>
  <text start="3610.35" dur="8.31">almost from the moment that we begin to</text>
  <text start="3614.85" dur="7.08">communicate with them because I where I</text>
  <text start="3618.66" dur="5.7">learn from they often end up wanting to</text>
  <text start="3621.93" dur="4.83">process the emotions and get deeper</text>
  <text start="3624.36" dur="4.8">emotional healing process memories</text>
  <text start="3626.76" dur="4.26">before and I&amp;#39;m like going you know what</text>
  <text start="3629.16" dur="4.32">the first thing I want to do is</text>
  <text start="3631.02" dur="4.05">introduce a new Jesus and I want to put</text>
  <text start="3633.48" dur="4.53">him in charge at this ministry time</text>
  <text start="3635.07" dur="4.8">rather than me assume that we have to</text>
  <text start="3638.01" dur="4.14">deal with memories and we have to deal</text>
  <text start="3639.87" dur="5.4">with emotions let me put the Lord in</text>
  <text start="3642.15" dur="5.76">charge so part of that is introducing</text>
  <text start="3645.27" dur="3.72">them to this person who&amp;#39;s the greatest</text>
  <text start="3647.91" dur="4.68">healer of all times</text>
  <text start="3648.99" dur="5.46">hmm you know and and who can be the best</text>
  <text start="3652.59" dur="5.07">friend cuz many of them felt so alone</text>
  <text start="3654.45" dur="6.87">and sowed overcoming some of them their</text>
  <text start="3657.66" dur="10.11">trepidation about meeting Jesus if beers</text>
  <text start="3661.32" dur="10.8">and when I put that first I tend to see</text>
  <text start="3667.77" dur="5.88">the ministry take place faster the Lord</text>
  <text start="3672.12" dur="5.16">heals the emotions in the most</text>
  <text start="3673.65" dur="7.32">incredible ways and we haven&amp;#39;t had to</text>
  <text start="3677.28" dur="6.24">explore the emotions they&amp;#39;re presented</text>
  <text start="3680.97" dur="5.22">and then the Lord&amp;#39;s comes in and heals</text>
  <text start="3683.52" dur="6.24">them gloriously there are times where we</text>
  <text start="3686.19" dur="5.79">have to explore them so I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3689.76" dur="4.08">start from the vantage point of we have</text>
  <text start="3691.98" dur="3.63">to do this and here&amp;#39;s how we do this</text>
  <text start="3693.84" dur="4.38">because I&amp;#39;ve learned so many different</text>
  <text start="3695.61" dur="4.2">keys and and but I&amp;#39;m like when I like to</text>
  <text start="3698.22" dur="4.71">put it in the Lord&amp;#39;s hands as soon as</text>
  <text start="3699.81" dur="4.44">possible so that varies because</text>
  <text start="3702.93" dur="5.09">sometimes you&amp;#39;re dealing with a child</text>
  <text start="3704.25" dur="7.11">part and you can&amp;#39;t talk to a child about</text>
  <text start="3708.02" dur="6.16">their sinfulness especially when they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3711.36" dur="5.31">been a victim I present you is in a very</text>
  <text start="3714.18" dur="6.99">different way to a child then I read an</text>
  <text start="3716.67" dur="6.24">over part you know and then it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="3721.17" dur="5.13">lot under the whole square just give me</text>
  <text start="3722.91" dur="7.47">the words and it is always just amazes</text>
  <text start="3726.3" dur="5.94">me what that looks like and how varied</text>
  <text start="3730.38" dur="5.04">it is because it&amp;#39;s all about connecting</text>
  <text start="3732.24" dur="4.07">them to a relationship but Jesus is not</text>
  <text start="3735.42" dur="2.66">kidding</text>
  <text start="3736.31" dur="3.92">for spiritual laws and a prayer at the</text>
  <text start="3738.08" dur="2.15">end</text>
  <text start="3740.53" dur="5.8">connecting them to Jesus and that looks</text>
  <text start="3743.27" dur="5.34">so different different times yeah you</text>
  <text start="3746.33" dur="4.02">know it&amp;#39;s interesting for me I have</text>
  <text start="3748.61" dur="4.53">found that when the Lord is leading me</text>
  <text start="3750.35" dur="4.26">to do you know any kind of ministry</text>
  <text start="3753.14" dur="3.98">whether it&amp;#39;s you know giving somebody</text>
  <text start="3754.61" dur="5.76">prophetic word or physical healing or</text>
  <text start="3757.12" dur="7.48">emotional healing it always always</text>
  <text start="3760.37" dur="6.57">always comes down to an issue of I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3764.6" dur="4.05">introducing you to Jesus the goal of</text>
  <text start="3766.94" dur="4.71">this interaction is not me getting you</text>
  <text start="3768.65" dur="5.52">healed of bursitis or a migraine</text>
  <text start="3771.65" dur="4.65">headache the goal of this interaction is</text>
  <text start="3774.17" dur="4.68">I want you to know something about Jesus</text>
  <text start="3776.3" dur="6.03">that you did not know yesterday I want</text>
  <text start="3778.85" dur="5.49">you to seek him out and develop a</text>
  <text start="3782.33" dur="3.75">stronger relationship with him like the</text>
  <text start="3784.34" dur="3.78">Lord gave me this dream that I talk</text>
  <text start="3786.08" dur="3.36">about all the time where I was in the</text>
  <text start="3788.12" dur="3.33">dream I was praying for people to be</text>
  <text start="3789.44" dur="3.48">healed in an emergency department and I</text>
  <text start="3791.45" dur="3.51">was praying for a doctor who had like</text>
  <text start="3792.92" dur="4.65">Anna I think it arthritis in his elbow</text>
  <text start="3794.96" dur="5.04">and I was praying for a child and in the</text>
  <text start="3797.57" dur="4.35">dream I knew that the most important</text>
  <text start="3800" dur="5.1">thing that the Lord wanted me to do was</text>
  <text start="3801.92" dur="6.87">introduce them to his presence getting</text>
  <text start="3805.1" dur="5.88">them healed was secondary and this is</text>
  <text start="3808.79" dur="6.18">really I think true and emotional</text>
  <text start="3810.98" dur="5.76">healing it is all about Jesus if Jesus</text>
  <text start="3814.97" dur="3.9">doesn&amp;#39;t get involved in the process it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3816.74" dur="4.47">not going to happen it was no point even</text>
  <text start="3818.87" dur="4.56">doing it because like you said earlier</text>
  <text start="3821.21" dur="5.43">you get Jesus involved in the dynamic</text>
  <text start="3823.43" dur="5.64">quicker it goes the better it goes he</text>
  <text start="3826.64" dur="4.14">needs to be in control of you know</text>
  <text start="3829.07" dur="3.42">what&amp;#39;s going to happen next I think I</text>
  <text start="3830.78" dur="5.43">like your your approach and that you</text>
  <text start="3832.49" dur="5.73">have kind of a setup to the encounter</text>
  <text start="3836.21" dur="4.14">certain things that you do I do the same</text>
  <text start="3838.22" dur="6.24">thing like I don&amp;#39;t say that I have a</text>
  <text start="3840.35" dur="6.27">formula but I have a certain number of</text>
  <text start="3844.46" dur="6.6">things that I do pretty routinely but</text>
  <text start="3846.62" dur="6.3">within that routine I always try to you</text>
  <text start="3851.06" dur="4.8">know let Jesus do whatever he wants to</text>
  <text start="3852.92" dur="5.49">do at any particular time change it up</text>
  <text start="3855.86" dur="5.22">do whatever because you really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3858.41" dur="5.42">know what his plan is and prophesying</text>
  <text start="3861.08" dur="5.61">right in middle of what I normally do</text>
  <text start="3863.83" dur="5.38">great and I&amp;#39;m like I know and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3866.69" dur="3.3">happening that it&amp;#39;s like the Lord knows</text>
  <text start="3869.21" dur="3.27">what party</text>
  <text start="3869.99" dur="6.42">the old already and he just jumped right</text>
  <text start="3872.48" dur="6.93">to talking to that part and most of the</text>
  <text start="3876.41" dur="6.06">time I really fight but I don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="3879.41" dur="5.72">guided stuff I&amp;#39;d stay away from that</text>
  <text start="3882.47" dur="6.48">except when the Holy Spirit tells me to</text>
  <text start="3885.13" dur="6.61">I&amp;#39;m not the type that goes I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="3888.95" dur="6.21">to tell you here&amp;#39;s where you are imagine</text>
  <text start="3891.74" dur="5.94">this and now do you see Jesus no I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3895.16" dur="5.19">more like when you see we&amp;#39;ve asked for</text>
  <text start="3897.68" dur="5.46">word to come and embrace what do you say</text>
  <text start="3900.35" dur="5.67">look here I don&amp;#39;t try to guide but when</text>
  <text start="3903.14" dur="6.15">when it becomes prophetic I go for it</text>
  <text start="3906.02" dur="5.88">scenes you and what happens invariably</text>
  <text start="3909.29" dur="5.16">but like to Santa just yesterday</text>
  <text start="3911.9" dur="4.92">multiple people I just started almost</text>
  <text start="3914.45" dur="5.61">right off the bat speaking prophetically</text>
  <text start="3916.82" dur="6.15">to apart and they were like going before</text>
  <text start="3920.06" dur="4.83">you said a word a little part that was</text>
  <text start="3922.97" dur="4.02">hiding and saying there&amp;#39;s no way you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3924.89" dur="4.56">going to get me to talk and then and</text>
  <text start="3926.99" dur="4.77">then I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m saying the Lord sees you</text>
  <text start="3929.45" dur="5.79">and you don&amp;#39;t want to be seen and it</text>
  <text start="3931.76" dur="4.32">scares you so bad right now then I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3935.24" dur="4.04">talking to you</text>
  <text start="3936.08" dur="6.029">and then I know you&amp;#39;re there and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3939.28" dur="5.53">saying but you don&amp;#39;t have to be afraid</text>
  <text start="3942.109" dur="4.921">of him and I just keep going on and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3944.81" dur="4.35">like I can tell them like everything</text>
  <text start="3947.03" dur="5.88">that you&amp;#39;re saying I felt is what I was</text>
  <text start="3949.16" dur="6.33">feeling before I even said it it was and</text>
  <text start="3952.91" dur="5.73">it&amp;#39;s the only spirit this guiding this</text>
  <text start="3955.49" dur="5.58">and he&amp;#39;s calling that part out that was</text>
  <text start="3958.64" dur="5.43">so amazing because it was then it merged</text>
  <text start="3961.07" dur="5.64">a whole massive leap she said they would</text>
  <text start="3964.07" dur="5.789">fill a stadium but it started with one</text>
  <text start="3966.71" dur="4.62">that was hidden and then it was weird</text>
  <text start="3969.859" dur="3.991">because as we administered that when I</text>
  <text start="3971.33" dur="5.58">kept someone behind it he was hiding in</text>
  <text start="3973.85" dur="4.59">a inner corner and the night as soon as</text>
  <text start="3976.91" dur="4.59">we were done ministering to that one I</text>
  <text start="3978.44" dur="5.96">said reward seems he doesn&amp;#39;t buy the one</text>
  <text start="3981.5" dur="4.859">and I said and there&amp;#39;s more behind you</text>
  <text start="3984.4" dur="6.13">and I said would you just step forward</text>
  <text start="3986.359" dur="6.841">and our sudden it was like this large</text>
  <text start="3990.53" dur="4.86">group and the woods begins to begin and</text>
  <text start="3993.2" dur="3.6">prophesy over the whole group and we</text>
  <text start="3995.39" dur="4.09">talked to the whole group because they</text>
  <text start="3996.8" dur="5.02">got to witness this one part</text>
  <text start="3999.48" dur="7.26">coming to Jesus and ministering to them</text>
  <text start="4001.82" dur="6.69">and so who else wants that human and it</text>
  <text start="4006.74" dur="4.35">was like they had all been watching and</text>
  <text start="4008.51" dur="4.44">they all step forward and just awesome</text>
  <text start="4011.09" dur="3.66">you just went through ministering each</text>
  <text start="4012.95" dur="3.42">one of them individually I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="4014.75" dur="5.4">the man&amp;#39;s of anything that what Jesus</text>
  <text start="4016.37" dur="5.46">said to any of them but it was like he</text>
  <text start="4020.15" dur="5.07">can be personal with every one of them</text>
  <text start="4021.83" dur="6.99">at the same time I&amp;#39;m that amazing how he</text>
  <text start="4025.22" dur="6.24">does it it&amp;#39;s you doing it all time we we</text>
  <text start="4028.82" dur="6.02">think in our little boxes but like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4031.46" dur="6.42">here in the Chinese Church pray and the</text>
  <text start="4034.84" dur="4.6">American and the applicant and the Asian</text>
  <text start="4037.88" dur="4.41">and you know all over the world he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4039.44" dur="6.21">hearing them all and he&amp;#39;s talking them</text>
  <text start="4042.29" dur="4.98">all and he&amp;#39;s telling all of these</text>
  <text start="4045.65" dur="4.71">children that are receiving ministry you</text>

  <text start="4055.61" dur="6.72">in a billion or six billion people that</text>

  <text start="4220.929" dur="5.431">that quest for power but a part of him</text>
  <text start="4224.29" dur="6.809">died every time you did that</text>
  <text start="4226.36" dur="8.31">and and I spoke for literally 15 20</text>
  <text start="4231.099" dur="7.111">minutes to Jezebel and my heart changed</text>
  <text start="4234.67" dur="9.9">towards Jezebel I was like seeing her as</text>
  <text start="4238.21" dur="10.08">a victim of her own sin and in bondage</text>
  <text start="4244.57" dur="5.73">to this her quest for power had cost her</text>
  <text start="4248.29" dur="5.849">her very soul she had zero self-respect</text>
  <text start="4250.3" dur="5.22">left and I have never Plus I never</text>
  <text start="4254.139" dur="3.901">thought about any of this</text>
  <text start="4255.52" dur="4.56">and when I was done I&amp;#39;m thinking okay so</text>
  <text start="4258.04" dur="4.74">you gonna like bite my head off</text>
  <text start="4260.08" dur="5.579">is she gonna continue to try to seduce</text>
  <text start="4262.78" dur="5.399">me she just begins to weep smus how</text>
  <text start="4265.659" dur="5.281">could he ever love me how could he ever</text>
  <text start="4268.179" dur="7.111">forgive me for the things that I&amp;#39;ve done</text>
  <text start="4270.94" dur="7.469">I didn&amp;#39;t have any more of that Jezebel</text>
  <text start="4275.29" dur="5.9">it kind of stuffed me in a little I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4278.409" dur="8.241">not even a little girl it was losing</text>
  <text start="4281.19" dur="7.469">young woman part that was so Daddy</text>
  <text start="4286.65" dur="8">to be washed and cleansed and forgiven</text>
  <text start="4288.659" dur="9.871">and it was beautiful it was powerful and</text>
  <text start="4294.65" dur="5.79">it may I had a whole freshen perspective</text>
  <text start="4298.53" dur="4.169">of desi baa</text>
  <text start="4300.44" dur="5.739">and of course this was a part this is</text>
  <text start="4302.699" dur="5.601">not that demon right but the people that</text>
  <text start="4306.179" dur="6.451">have subjected themselves to that spirit</text>
  <text start="4308.3" dur="8.98">right and what it has cost them and they</text>
  <text start="4312.63" dur="8.25">are not the demon um I&amp;#39;ve never believed</text>
  <text start="4317.28" dur="5.58">that they are I battled Jezebel in</text>
  <text start="4320.88" dur="4.95">different churches and I know it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="4322.86" dur="5.19">the person that&amp;#39;s coming against me or</text>
  <text start="4325.83" dur="5.31">the prophetic it&amp;#39;s the spirit and so I</text>
  <text start="4328.05" dur="4.77">battle it in the spirit realm but this</text>
  <text start="4331.14" dur="6">was like a whole fresh new perspective</text>
  <text start="4332.82" dur="8.31">and I was just like wow Lord I see</text>
  <text start="4337.14" dur="7.17">Jezebel through your eyes now the person</text>
  <text start="4341.13" dur="5.46">and the people that have been that have</text>
  <text start="4344.31" dur="6.84">given themselves to that spirit the</text>
  <text start="4346.59" dur="7.649">demonic was gone I&amp;#39;m so easily and that</text>
  <text start="4351.15" dur="4.17">was it was pretty incredible well the</text>
  <text start="4354.239" dur="5.311">truth is powerful</text>
  <text start="4355.32" dur="6.87">yeah so quick question for you can</text>
  <text start="4359.55" dur="5.669">emotional healing and deliverance be</text>
  <text start="4362.19" dur="7.86">done safely by an individual on</text>
  <text start="4365.219" dur="8.221">themselves Justin is safe to do on your</text>
  <text start="4370.05" dur="6.57">own and yes we need other people to do</text>
  <text start="4373.44" dur="5.489">it I I believe that we are the body of</text>
  <text start="4376.62" dur="5.46">Christ for a reason and we need one</text>
  <text start="4378.929" dur="5.31">another I also believe that or has given</text>
  <text start="4382.08" dur="4.44">us everything we need for life and</text>
  <text start="4384.239" dur="8.061">diamonds that doesn&amp;#39;t mean I don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="4386.52" dur="9.449">to do and I um what&amp;#39;s his name goodness</text>
  <text start="4392.3" dur="6.22">like Jack Frost used to go twice a year</text>
  <text start="4395.969" dur="5.161">to receive ministry and he would talk</text>
  <text start="4398.52" dur="4.8">about that open and I thought god that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4401.13" dur="5.52">a way I want to be I don&amp;#39;t have money to</text>
  <text start="4403.32" dur="4.95">go search out people from national field</text>
  <text start="4406.65" dur="3.33">I mean always have to have a ministry</text>
  <text start="4408.27" dur="4.48">multiple Tony but he would go for a week</text>
  <text start="4409.98" dur="6.13">of ministry and</text>
  <text start="4412.75" dur="6.06">I believe that we need each other there</text>
  <text start="4416.11" dur="6.57">are times I had to do self deliverance</text>
  <text start="4418.81" dur="6.9">and there are times that I do need to go</text>
  <text start="4422.68" dur="6.6">to someone else some of these type of</text>
  <text start="4425.71" dur="5.16">things I&amp;#39;ve known people like for me I</text>
  <text start="4429.28" dur="4.709">wouldn&amp;#39;t even know where to begin to</text>
  <text start="4430.87" dur="5.099">deal with a part in myself because it</text>
  <text start="4433.989" dur="4.411">wasn&amp;#39;t aware of any part someone Ellen</text>
  <text start="4435.969" dur="3.991">you got to tell me they said I&amp;#39;m getting</text>
  <text start="4438.4" dur="3.54">appointment for six months and I knew</text>
  <text start="4439.96" dur="3.42">that what was going on and I read</text>
  <text start="4441.94" dur="3.36">everything and I understood it so I</text>
  <text start="4443.38" dur="3.839">began to do it to myself and I had</text>
  <text start="4445.3" dur="5.37">merged numerous parts before I went to</text>
  <text start="4447.219" dur="7.261">administer s1 it&amp;#39;s amazing you know so</text>
  <text start="4450.67" dur="6.48">it can be done on oneself to some degree</text>
  <text start="4454.48" dur="4.17">but I didn&amp;#39;t believe we need each other</text>
  <text start="4457.15" dur="5.16">and Donny Christ needs</text>
  <text start="4458.65" dur="7.14">I&amp;#39;m only gifted people too yeah and I</text>
  <text start="4462.31" dur="5.639">would agree I have some situations where</text>
  <text start="4465.79" dur="3.659">I&amp;#39;ve been I felt so emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="4467.949" dur="3.961">right as quickly you know gave it to</text>
  <text start="4469.449" dur="5.611">Jesus and he took care of it didn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="4471.91" dur="5.91">anybody else involved but I&amp;#39;ve had those</text>
  <text start="4475.06" dur="6.54">more significant traumatic things where</text>
  <text start="4477.82" dur="6">I knew this was bigger than me and I</text>
  <text start="4481.6" dur="3.63">needed some help so I got a hold of one</text>
  <text start="4483.82" dur="5.19">of my buddies and they walked me through</text>
  <text start="4485.23" dur="7.32">the process so that&amp;#39;s cool what do you</text>
  <text start="4489.01" dur="6.33">think is the key thing about emotional</text>
  <text start="4492.55" dur="6.99">healing deliverance that most people are</text>
  <text start="4495.34" dur="7.2">missing there&amp;#39;s a lot of valuable keys</text>
  <text start="4499.54" dur="6">but I guess that thing we&amp;#39;ve talked</text>
  <text start="4502.54" dur="6.659">about a fair amount today and something</text>
  <text start="4505.54" dur="5.25">that nice my ministry after many years</text>
  <text start="4509.199" dur="5.161">of doing this even teaching people how</text>
  <text start="4510.79" dur="8.57">to hear God&amp;#39;s voice is just learning to</text>
  <text start="4514.36" dur="9.78">facilitate an encounter with Jesus is I</text>
  <text start="4519.36" dur="7.959">feel like accomplish more by doing less</text>
  <text start="4524.14" dur="3.179">[Music]</text>
  <text start="4528.409" dur="5.671">very easy to say and it&amp;#39;s actually very</text>
  <text start="4531.35" dur="4.98">easy to do but for many people looks</text>
  <text start="4534.08" dur="5.159">like what did you just say how do you do</text>
  <text start="4536.33" dur="5.579">that but it really is it&amp;#39;s amazing how</text>
  <text start="4539.239" dur="6.121">easy it is and it&amp;#39;s amazing not powerful</text>
  <text start="4541.909" dur="5.551">in this I would agree you know it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="4545.36" dur="6.54">of funny when I do physical healing a</text>
  <text start="4547.46" dur="7.65">lot of times I&amp;#39;ll be exhausted but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4551.9" dur="5.43">done doing you know just doing ministry</text>
  <text start="4555.11" dur="4.589">with a group of people I want to do</text>
  <text start="4557.33" dur="4.71">emotional healing I don&amp;#39;t get nearly</text>
  <text start="4559.699" dur="6.331">exhausted and I have much better results</text>
  <text start="4562.04" dur="7.92">with emotional heat like it&amp;#39;s less work</text>
  <text start="4566.03" dur="5.91">because I&amp;#39;ve come to realize Jesus is</text>
  <text start="4569.96" dur="3.96">really the one doing the work and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4571.94" dur="3.779">just kind of sitting back and you know</text>
  <text start="4573.92" dur="3.719">perceiving and understanding okay what</text>
  <text start="4575.719" dur="3.42">is Jesus saying what&amp;#39;s he doing and and</text>
  <text start="4577.639" dur="4.08">he&amp;#39;s doing most of the work I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="4579.139" dur="5.881">kind of hanging back being a narrator</text>
  <text start="4581.719" dur="6.601">sort of well the truth is they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="4585.02" dur="6.51">interconnected we we have people come in</text>
  <text start="4588.32" dur="5.04">for physical healing and I don&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="4591.53" dur="5.73">by just going after physical healing</text>
  <text start="4593.36" dur="7.379">I go most of our physical issues are</text>
  <text start="4597.26" dur="6.24">meeting the spiritual stuff and even</text>
  <text start="4600.739" dur="4.771">stuff like you talked about generational</text>
  <text start="4603.5" dur="3.9">my own sister had five vertebrae damage</text>
  <text start="4605.51" dur="4.89">and it was from a number of car</text>
  <text start="4607.4" dur="5.279">accidents the first clearly it might be</text>
  <text start="4610.4" dur="4.83">generational was the fact that my mom</text>
  <text start="4612.679" dur="5.04">had the exact same operation at the</text>
  <text start="4615.23" dur="5.219">exact same age now her discs had been</text>
  <text start="4617.719" dur="4.411">chipped and pieces a bone or sticking in</text>
  <text start="4620.449" dur="3.75">the spinal cord both of them the same</text>
  <text start="4622.13" dur="3.839">thing happen I have not heard of that</text>
  <text start="4624.199" dur="4.471">but like one other person in all my</text>
  <text start="4625.969" dur="4.92">years of ministry but it was like the</text>
  <text start="4628.67" dur="5.009">fourth or fifth vertebrae down on both</text>
  <text start="4630.889" dur="6.181">of them chips a bone stuck in the spinal</text>
  <text start="4633.679" dur="7.101">cord and they had to go in from the</text>
  <text start="4637.07" dur="7.069">throat the front of the throat to and</text>
  <text start="4640.78" dur="5.62">you know open up their spinal or the</text>
  <text start="4644.139" dur="3.701">discs and remove these chips of bone</text>
  <text start="4646.4" dur="5.1">from the spinal cord and put our back</text>
  <text start="4647.84" dur="5.71">together and 50% chance you lose your</text>
  <text start="4651.5" dur="3.85">voice on this operation</text>
  <text start="4653.55" dur="4.32">first clue that it might be generational</text>
  <text start="4655.35" dur="4.83">is 32 years of age and 32 years of age</text>
  <text start="4657.87" dur="5.07">both of them had the same operation</text>
  <text start="4660.18" dur="4.11">my sister had originally thought well</text>
  <text start="4662.94" dur="5.01">this isn&amp;#39;t something spiritual because</text>
  <text start="4664.29" dur="5.73">it happened in car accident so you know</text>
  <text start="4667.95" dur="5.94">thinking my brother heals people of</text>
  <text start="4670.02" dur="6.42">spiritual stuff um I see it all in a</text>
  <text start="4673.89" dur="3.96">woven and I&amp;#39;m gonna go on or we don&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="4676.44" dur="3.08">don&amp;#39;t know but it okay there&amp;#39;s a pretty</text>
  <text start="4677.85" dur="3.99">good clue that it might be generation</text>
  <text start="4679.52" dur="4.78">that&amp;#39;s the Holy Spirit revealed to us</text>
  <text start="4681.84" dur="4.89">what the root was and my dad and I were</text>
  <text start="4684.3" dur="4.05">both praying for and instantly we both</text>
  <text start="4686.73" dur="7.02">had visions I mean both of the visions</text>
  <text start="4688.35" dur="10.71">it had to do with abuse of slaves and in</text>
  <text start="4693.75" dur="7.8">my vision it was also KKK and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4699.06" dur="3.99">remember if I knew at that time but at</text>
  <text start="4701.55" dur="2.76">some point along my journey I found out</text>
  <text start="4703.05" dur="1.86">that both sides of our family owned</text>
  <text start="4704.31" dur="3.06">slaves</text>
  <text start="4704.91" dur="5.72">and but you don&amp;#39;t write in the history</text>
  <text start="4707.37" dur="6.81">book what anybody did but I saw you know</text>
  <text start="4710.63" dur="5.37">these atrocities so my sister repented</text>
  <text start="4714.18" dur="7.23">on behalf of the sins of our forefathers</text>
  <text start="4716" dur="7.9">and that day she pulled the neck brace</text>
  <text start="4721.41" dur="4.68">off had total movement in her neck pain</text>
  <text start="4723.9" dur="3.96">in her bedroom went to the doctor they</text>
  <text start="4726.09" dur="4.32">x-rayed in this and the doctor wrote</text>
  <text start="4727.86" dur="7.11">soon on her paperwork he said all the</text>
  <text start="4730.41" dur="7.71">tips of bone aren&amp;#39;t gone and so there</text>
  <text start="4734.97" dur="6.72">was pretty amazing miraculous healing</text>
  <text start="4738.12" dur="6.09">that day dealing with generational</text>
  <text start="4741.69" dur="6.33">curses and spiritual roots to what</text>
  <text start="4744.21" dur="5.85">appeared to be just a physical issue so</text>
  <text start="4748.02" dur="4.65">and then he played over physical healing</text>
  <text start="4750.06" dur="5.64">but when she opened up to me mean it</text>
  <text start="4752.67" dur="5.94">could be something spiritual bone in on</text>
  <text start="4755.7" dur="5.4">the healing took place so I&amp;#39;m with you I</text>
  <text start="4758.61" dur="5.07">am taking a much more integrative</text>
  <text start="4761.1" dur="4.17">approach kind of a if you want to call</text>
  <text start="4763.68" dur="3.72">it holistic approach toward healing now</text>
  <text start="4765.27" dur="4.8">especially when there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="4767.4" dur="4.47">Christians who have received prayer from</text>
  <text start="4770.07" dur="3.87">ministries who have a pretty good track</text>
  <text start="4771.87" dur="5.49">record and you know they&amp;#39;re still not</text>
  <text start="4773.94" dur="6.24">healed I had a very similar case with a</text>
  <text start="4777.36" dur="5.07">woman like you this woman had been in</text>
  <text start="4780.18" dur="4.83">car accidents and had really bad neck</text>
  <text start="4782.43" dur="3.84">and back pain and she you know just kind</text>
  <text start="4785.01" dur="1.689">of assumed it was because of the car</text>
  <text start="4786.27" dur="2.559">accident</text>
  <text start="4786.699" dur="3.871">she had received a lot of prayer wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4788.829" dur="4.23">healed we took her through the emotional</text>
  <text start="4790.57" dur="6.33">healing process by the time we were done</text>
  <text start="4793.059" dur="6.18">all of her pain was gone and I see so</text>
  <text start="4796.9" dur="4.199">much more of that now when I get someone</text>
  <text start="4799.239" dur="4.59">who comes to me and says hey I need to</text>
  <text start="4801.099" dur="5.19">be healed of X Y Z and I my first</text>
  <text start="4803.829" dur="5.491">question is have you received prayer for</text>
  <text start="4806.289" dur="4.741">it before and if you say no sometimes</text>
  <text start="4809.32" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ll just go straight forward with you</text>
  <text start="4811.03" dur="5.52">know releasing power or using authority</text>
  <text start="4813.88" dur="5.04">but if they say yeah I&amp;#39;ve received</text>
  <text start="4816.55" dur="5.1">prayer a lot and I&amp;#39;ve never been healed</text>
  <text start="4818.92" dur="4.199">yet that to me that indicates that</text>
  <text start="4821.65" dur="3.659">there&amp;#39;s something else going on besides</text>
  <text start="4823.119" dur="4.62">just you know a physical problem it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4825.309" dur="6.54">probably emotional or generational and I</text>
  <text start="4827.739" dur="6.831">see a lot better success when you look</text>
  <text start="4831.849" dur="5.73">at multiple different issues and</text>
  <text start="4834.57" dur="6.94">systematically work through them nope</text>
  <text start="4837.579" dur="5.491">mine are minute all agree so consider a</text>
  <text start="4841.51" dur="4.379">little bit more about your book the</text>
  <text start="4843.07" dur="4.679">Jesus training manual yeah I had</text>
  <text start="4845.889" dur="4.5">launched a thing on a book called the 40</text>

  <text start="4867.489" dur="3.98">that was my prayer Lord would you teach</text>
  <text start="4869.229" dur="4.801">me the things you taught to twelve and</text>
  <text start="4871.469" dur="4.181">because discipleship is so misunderstood</text>
  <text start="4874.03" dur="4.14">would change the title to the Jesus</text>
  <text start="4875.65" dur="4.11">training him because I believe that what</text>
  <text start="4878.17" dur="3.69">the word began to show me was the very</text>
  <text start="4879.76" dur="4.29">foundational things that Jesus taught</text>
  <text start="4881.86" dur="4.199">his disciples in the Great Commission he</text>
  <text start="4884.05" dur="5.64">said teach them everything I&amp;#39;ve taught</text>
  <text start="4886.059" dur="7.25">you and I would swear that part of the</text>
  <text start="4889.69" dur="5.61">Great Commission was added at some point</text>
  <text start="4893.309" dur="3.881">because we were Great Commission</text>
  <text start="4895.3" dur="3.719">churches but none of us had ever really</text>
  <text start="4897.19" dur="4.739">examined what did you teach his</text>
  <text start="4899.019" dur="4.741">disciples of course we read the New</text>
  <text start="4901.929" dur="4.261">Testament and we would you know but</text>
  <text start="4903.76" dur="5.129">never from the examine what wasn&amp;#39;t Judas</text>
  <text start="4906.19" dur="4.639">Tony&amp;#39;s disciples if they&amp;#39;re to go and</text>
  <text start="4908.889" dur="5.07">teach everyone the stuff he taught them</text>
  <text start="4910.829" dur="6.25">what did he teach them seems like such a</text>
  <text start="4913.959" dur="6.671">simple basic thing but when I did that</text>
  <text start="4917.079" dur="5.41">I&amp;#39;m going this is so radically different</text>
  <text start="4920.63" dur="5.46">anything I&amp;#39;ve experienced or seen in</text>
  <text start="4922.489" dur="6">church so you know as Lord taught me</text>
  <text start="4926.09" dur="4.47">different things I was like what is when</text>
  <text start="4928.489" dur="4.741">you boil it all down what is it what did</text>
  <text start="4930.56" dur="4.8">Jesus teach you taught the disciples by</text>
  <text start="4933.23" dur="3.449">his example front one thing&amp;#39;s you said I</text>
  <text start="4935.36" dur="3.87">never do anything of my own initiative</text>
  <text start="4936.679" dur="4.861">only do they see the father doing he</text>
  <text start="4939.23" dur="5.13">talked about here at the shop sheep hear</text>
  <text start="4941.54" dur="5.099">the Shepherd&amp;#39;s voice and so he was</text>
  <text start="4944.36" dur="5.04">teaching them how to hear the father&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4946.639" dur="6.361">voice how to have a communion with the</text>
  <text start="4949.4" dur="5.73">father and with him and so that was one</text>
  <text start="4953" dur="3.989">of the keys that Jesus was teaching he</text>
  <text start="4955.13" dur="3.54">taught them that they have authority and</text>
  <text start="4956.989" dur="5.611">power gave them authority and power to</text>
  <text start="4958.67" dur="5.819">cast out demons to heal the sick to very</text>
  <text start="4962.6" dur="4.59">powerful keys that I had never been</text>
  <text start="4964.489" dur="4.531">given I did not know that he has given</text>
  <text start="4967.19" dur="4.62">us everything we need to be able to heal</text>
  <text start="4969.02" dur="5.28">the sick to cast out demons the kingdom</text>
  <text start="4971.81" dur="4.55">of God that&amp;#39;s a study I&amp;#39;m doing a fresh</text>
  <text start="4974.3" dur="6.149">again for I don&amp;#39;t know how many times</text>
  <text start="4976.36" dur="6.46">but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s so radically different</text>
  <text start="4980.449" dur="6.151">when you look at the truth of the</text>
  <text start="4982.82" dur="5.22">kingdom of God I&amp;#39;m like going how did I</text>
  <text start="4986.6" dur="5.22">have a seminary doing I couldn&amp;#39;t answer</text>
  <text start="4988.04" dur="6.59">easily well what the kingdom of heaven</text>
  <text start="4991.82" dur="5.19">and the kingdom of God were were about I</text>
  <text start="4994.63" dur="3.94">could have sounded intelligent because</text>
  <text start="4997.01" dur="3.209">when you get degrees you always have to</text>
  <text start="4998.57" dur="4.29">let&amp;#39;s try to come off like you know what</text>
  <text start="5000.219" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re talking about but I knew that I</text>
  <text start="5002.86" dur="5.16">didn&amp;#39;t have a real solid answer for that</text>
  <text start="5004.719" dur="5.131">but that&amp;#39;s what the that&amp;#39;s what Paul</text>
  <text start="5008.02" dur="3.75">says he went about preaching the kingdom</text>
  <text start="5009.85" dur="3.329">of God and he went about teaching the</text>
  <text start="5011.77" dur="3.21">kingdom of God is what the disciples</text>
  <text start="5013.179" dur="3.631">went out teaching it&amp;#39;s what Jesus taught</text>
  <text start="5014.98" dur="3.33">repent for the kingdom of heaven is at</text>
  <text start="5016.81" dur="3.179">hand and he went from town to town</text>
  <text start="5018.31" dur="3.599">preaching the kingdom guys healing the</text>
  <text start="5019.989" dur="3.69">sick casting out demons that&amp;#39;s repeated</text>
  <text start="5021.909" dur="7.741">over and over again and I was like what</text>
  <text start="5023.679" dur="8.101">is the kingdom of God so it&amp;#39;s those type</text>
  <text start="5029.65" dur="4.14">of foundational things out authority the</text>
  <text start="5031.78" dur="5.37">power of God what I believe would be</text>
  <text start="5033.79" dur="6.81">class r1 101 but I had been to so many</text>
  <text start="5037.15" dur="6.029">class 101 and never heard these things</text>
  <text start="5040.6" dur="7.349">so that&amp;#39;s what Gina&amp;#39;s training manual is</text>
  <text start="5043.179" dur="7.111">about write down I love that that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="5047.949" dur="4.651">thing that the Lord has had me focus on</text>
  <text start="5050.29" dur="4.17">for the last five years and which is why</text>
  <text start="5052.6" dur="3.96">my books in my series</text>
  <text start="5054.46" dur="3.63">kingdom of God made simple healing made</text>
  <text start="5056.56" dur="4.2">simple seeing in the spirit here in</text>

  <text start="5060.76" dur="5.16">of God it&amp;#39;s well it&amp;#39;s hey look what did</text>
  <text start="5063.52" dur="5.58">Jesus actually teach his disciples yeah</text>
  <text start="5065.92" dur="5.4">you&amp;#39;re God&amp;#39;s voice to release power to</text>
  <text start="5069.1" dur="4.47">exercise authority to raise the dead</text>
  <text start="5071.32" dur="4.05">those are the things that he taught his</text>
  <text start="5073.57" dur="4.56">disciples and then he told the disciples</text>
  <text start="5075.37" dur="5.43">go and teach the world all the things</text>
  <text start="5078.13" dur="4.47">I&amp;#39;ve taught you people can get</text>

  <text start="5170.56" dur="4.86">session for each of their semesters but</text>
  <text start="5173.41" dur="4.26">I don&amp;#39;t really do a lot of teaching</text>
  <text start="5175.42" dur="5.64">inside of churches church buildings I</text>
  <text start="5177.67" dur="6.24">get requests but that&amp;#39;s not what the</text>
  <text start="5181.06" dur="4.62">Lord is actually asked me to do so my</text>
  <text start="5183.91" dur="4.08">experiences is very different from a lot</text>
  <text start="5185.68" dur="4.35">of people and and the</text>
  <text start="5187.99" dur="3.93">message that I put out there about you</text>
  <text start="5190.03" dur="4.44">know anyone can do it and you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="5191.92" dur="5.13">to be anyone special is very well</text>
  <text start="5194.47" dur="5.01">received I tend to reach a lot of people</text>
  <text start="5197.05" dur="4.14">who are believers and they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="5199.48" dur="4.19">believers and they&amp;#39;re still pursuing God</text>
  <text start="5201.19" dur="5.25">but they either outgrown Church because</text>
  <text start="5203.67" dur="4.18">they&amp;#39;ve been going to you know whatever</text>
  <text start="5206.44" dur="2.85">does nomination will charge for five</text>
  <text start="5207.85" dur="4.32">years they&amp;#39;ve heard all the messages and</text>
  <text start="5209.29" dur="4.38">they stopped growing they grew for a</text>
  <text start="5212.17" dur="3.24">while they were interested in things and</text>
  <text start="5213.67" dur="3.39">then they just started hearing the same</text>
  <text start="5215.41" dur="3.36">things over and over again and they</text>
  <text start="5217.06" dur="3.6">weren&amp;#39;t really going anywhere different</text>
  <text start="5218.77" dur="3.6">anything new a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="5220.66" dur="3.99">frustrated with the institutional church</text>
  <text start="5222.37" dur="4.53">because it seems to lack power there</text>
  <text start="5224.65" dur="4.62">really isn&amp;#39;t a lot of signs and miracles</text>
  <text start="5226.9" dur="4.41">and wonders going on unless you go to</text>
  <text start="5229.27" dur="3.54">places like Bethel and you know there</text>
  <text start="5231.31" dur="5.88">are some more of those churches popping</text>
  <text start="5232.81" dur="7.29">up here and there but I tend to draw to</text>
  <text start="5237.19" dur="4.86">my following people who are have either</text>
  <text start="5240.1" dur="3.09">been or just fed up with Church they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="5242.05" dur="2.73">been kicked out of churches they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5243.19" dur="4.35">going to be used by church leadership a</text>
  <text start="5244.78" dur="6">lot of those people I actually end up</text>
  <text start="5247.54" dur="5.7">doing some emotional healing because of</text>
  <text start="5250.78" dur="3.87">the betrayal or abuse of you know in</text>
  <text start="5253.24" dur="4.59">leadership and things like that that</text>
  <text start="5254.65" dur="5.01">tends to be a large cross-section of the</text>
  <text start="5257.83" dur="4.53">people that I end up drawing into my</text>
  <text start="5259.66" dur="4.08">message and when they run into me</text>
  <text start="5262.36" dur="3.15">they&amp;#39;re like hey you talking about</text>
  <text start="5263.74" dur="3.33">healing and traveling the spirit and</text>
  <text start="5265.51" dur="4.35">singing in the spirit and hearing God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5267.07" dur="4.77">voice and then those are kind of my key</text>
  <text start="5269.86" dur="3.75">things that I teach about and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5271.84" dur="4.2">really interesting especially with</text>
  <text start="5273.61" dur="3.96">traveling in the spirit now since I</text>
  <text start="5276.04" dur="3.27">published that book people are coming</text>
  <text start="5277.57" dur="3.51">out of the woodwork who are having</text>
  <text start="5279.31" dur="3.18">experiences of traveling into the</text>
  <text start="5281.08" dur="3.78">heavens and traveling around the world</text>
  <text start="5282.49" dur="4.32">and you know praying for people and</text>
  <text start="5284.86" dur="4.14">doing ministry and they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="5286.81" dur="5.25">traveling you know in the spirit and</text>
  <text start="5289" dur="5.52">that is a very interesting thing that</text>
  <text start="5292.06" dur="5.43">God has put on the map now how much</text>
  <text start="5294.52" dur="5.55">abuse have you seen of that and abuse of</text>
  <text start="5297.49" dur="6.54">traveling in the spirit well well you</text>
  <text start="5300.07" dur="7.23">know um the not much abuse hardly any</text>
  <text start="5304.03" dur="6.75">what I would call abuse what I do see a</text>
  <text start="5307.3" dur="5.49">lot of is I I run into a fair number</text>
  <text start="5310.78" dur="5.37">people who have come from the New Age</text>
  <text start="5312.79" dur="5.82">well you know and they&amp;#39;ve they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5316.15" dur="4.56">familiar with astral projection and some</text>
  <text start="5318.61" dur="4.47">of them are familiar with witchcraft</text>
  <text start="5320.71" dur="3.9">and some of the things to do those</text>
  <text start="5323.08" dur="4.2">people tend to be very leery about</text>
  <text start="5324.61" dur="4.56">traveling in the spirit and so then I</text>
  <text start="5327.28" dur="4.47">get to have the conversations where I</text>
  <text start="5329.17" dur="6.09">explained to them okay so there&amp;#39;s astral</text>
  <text start="5331.75" dur="7.2">projection and there is what the Apostle</text>
  <text start="5335.26" dur="6.06">Paul did and what Elijah did what Jesus</text>
  <text start="5338.95" dur="3.75">did and what the Apostle John did all</text>
  <text start="5341.32" dur="3.09">through the book of Revelation they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5342.7" dur="3.12">traveling in the spirit but it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="5344.41" dur="4.89">astral projection it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="5345.82" dur="6.48">different I tend to have more</text>
  <text start="5349.3" dur="4.98">discussions with people who have are</text>
  <text start="5352.3" dur="5.1">familiar with traveling in the spirit</text>
  <text start="5354.28" dur="6.27">but they&amp;#39;re afraid because they have</text>
  <text start="5357.4" dur="4.44">seen the dark side of it now when I</text>
  <text start="5360.55" dur="3.33">first came out with the book on</text>
  <text start="5361.84" dur="5.19">traveling in the spirit I did run into</text>
  <text start="5363.88" dur="4.98">some people who you know they just</text>
  <text start="5367.03" dur="2.91">thought it was heresy and nonsense and</text>
  <text start="5368.86" dur="2.52">it&amp;#39;s all astral projection and</text>
  <text start="5369.94" dur="3.09">witchcraft and that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="5371.38" dur="4.32">I don&amp;#39;t really engage those people</text>
  <text start="5373.03" dur="3.959">because they&amp;#39;re not interested and and</text>
  <text start="5375.7" dur="3.87">if they&amp;#39;re not interested in the subject</text>
  <text start="5376.989" dur="5.811">matter I I don&amp;#39;t get into arguments with</text>
  <text start="5379.57" dur="6.93">people I&amp;#39;m interested in finding people</text>
  <text start="5382.8" dur="5.89">who want to learn more about it and so I</text>
  <text start="5386.5" dur="5.1">tend to look for those types of people</text>
  <text start="5388.69" dur="4.89">to talk with one of the things that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5391.6" dur="4.46">interesting is when you get into</text>
  <text start="5393.58" dur="6.62">emotional healing and deliverance okay</text>
  <text start="5396.06" dur="6.61">you&amp;#39;re engaging the spiritual realm</text>
  <text start="5400.2" dur="5.26">you&amp;#39;re engaging the demonic you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5402.67" dur="5.49">engaging the angelic realm and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="5405.46" dur="7.56">talking about an interdimensional</text>
  <text start="5408.16" dur="7.29">existence of non-physical beings all</text>
  <text start="5413.02" dur="4.98">these different parts of the soul they</text>
  <text start="5415.45" dur="7.11">don&amp;#39;t exist in the physical realm right</text>
  <text start="5418" dur="7.65">well so that kind of integrates into</text>
  <text start="5422.56" dur="4.89">this whole question of Oh what is it to</text>
  <text start="5425.65" dur="4.62">travel in the spirit into the spiritual</text>
  <text start="5427.45" dur="4.62">world what is it and really at bottom</text>
  <text start="5430.27" dur="4.35">when it comes down to for me is I tell</text>
  <text start="5432.07" dur="6.3">people look we are having interactions</text>
  <text start="5434.62" dur="6.66">in the non-physical realm all the time</text>
  <text start="5438.37" dur="8.22">we&amp;#39;re just not aware of it your spirit</text>
