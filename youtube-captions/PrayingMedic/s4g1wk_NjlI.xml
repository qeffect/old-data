  <text start="148.23" dur="8.759">the big news today tax bill passed most</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="6.901">of you probably know that as a result of</text>
  <text start="156.989" dur="5.03">the tax bill I would like to say this</text>
  <text start="160.11" dur="5.099">and I just find this very interesting</text>
  <text start="162.019" dur="8.201">for companies that I know of so far have</text>
  <text start="165.209" dur="9.511">come out and changed their wages and</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="10.29">benefits as a result of the tax reform</text>

  <text start="188.22" dur="5.489">charitable contributions and workplace</text>
  <text start="190.65" dur="9.3">investments in response to the tax bill</text>
  <text start="193.709" dur="8.791">a bank called Fifth Third Bank has</text>
  <text start="199.95" dur="5.22">announced they&amp;#39;re going to raise their</text>
  <text start="202.5" dur="4.35">minimum wage to $15 an hour and they&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="224.19" dur="5.19">to target two percent of their after-tax</text>
  <text start="226.919" dur="5.011">profits for corporate corporate</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="7.41">philanthropy beginning in 2019 as a</text>
  <text start="231.93" dur="8.97">result of the tax breaks companies are</text>
  <text start="236.79" dur="7.44">coming out of the woodwork to share the</text>
  <text start="240.9" dur="5.399">wealth with their employees as a result</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="7.22">of the tax break and it&amp;#39;s interesting to</text>
  <text start="246.299" dur="8.041">me because in classic you know liberal</text>
  <text start="251.45" dur="5.92">economics they believe you have to</text>
  <text start="254.34" dur="7.35">legislate you have to pass laws in order</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="9.45">to make employers give you a fair wage</text>
  <text start="261.69" dur="8.67">but if you look at you know Reagan&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="6.15">of trickle-down economics if you if you</text>
  <text start="270.36" dur="5.4">bless and if you prosper the</text>
  <text start="272.97" dur="5.46">corporation&amp;#39;s the companies that hire</text>
  <text start="275.76" dur="4.95">people they will in turn take the</text>
  <text start="278.43" dur="3.54">profits and they&amp;#39;ll give them to the</text>
  <text start="280.71" dur="3.99">employees they&amp;#39;ll give them better wages</text>
  <text start="281.97" dur="4.74">or give them better benefits you benefit</text>
  <text start="284.7" dur="4.86">the employees by benefiting the</text>
  <text start="286.71" dur="5.97">employers you don&amp;#39;t have to legislate</text>
  <text start="289.56" dur="5.1">fair wages just do fair taxes and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.68" dur="5.67">what we&amp;#39;re seeing we&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="294.66" dur="5.61">immediately the evidence that</text>
  <text start="298.35" dur="4.59">trickle-down economics actually works</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="4.62">and companies are going out of and this</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="4.05">is the first day this is in the first</text>
  <text start="304.89" dur="4.23">few hours after the tax bill has passed</text>
  <text start="306.99" dur="4.32">these companies are coming out with all</text>
  <text start="309.12" dur="6.45">these great benefits increase wages and</text>
  <text start="311.31" dur="6.06">tax pay benefits and imagine how much</text>
  <text start="315.57" dur="5.61">more we&amp;#39;re going to see in the next few</text>
  <text start="317.37" dur="6.33">months in the next year we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="321.18" dur="5.64">see huge economic growth as a result of</text>
  <text start="323.7" dur="6.27">the tax breaks better benefits better</text>
  <text start="326.82" dur="6.24">wages for everybody that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="329.97" dur="4.56">this is gonna result in so I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="333.06" dur="6.62">incredibly encouraging to see that</text>
  <text start="334.53" dur="5.15">happening it didn&amp;#39;t take very long so</text>
  <text start="339.86" dur="5.08">the next thing that we need to be a</text>
  <text start="342.66" dur="4.86">little bit concerned about is the</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="4.17">government shutdown so the government is</text>
  <text start="347.52" dur="3.21">technically funded there&amp;#39;s a continuing</text>
  <text start="349.11" dur="3.42">resolution that runs out Friday night</text>
  <text start="350.73" dur="4.47">today&amp;#39;s Wednesday we&amp;#39;ve got two more</text>
  <text start="352.53" dur="5.66">days House and Senate have to get</text>
  <text start="355.2" dur="5.76">together and they have to come up with a</text>
  <text start="358.19" dur="7.3">continuing resolution or a budget that</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="6.99">will get them past Friday so we do have</text>
  <text start="365.49" dur="4.47">this issue of the possible government</text>
  <text start="367.95" dur="3.77">shutdown of course Democrats are</text>
  <text start="369.96" dur="5.76">threatening to shut down the government</text>
  <text start="371.72" dur="5.52">if they don&amp;#39;t get daca the house is</text>
  <text start="375.72" dur="4.53">going to have to come up with a proposal</text>
  <text start="377.24" dur="7.48">to either a continuing resolution or a</text>
  <text start="380.25" dur="7.53">budget to get past Friday and one of the</text>
  <text start="384.72" dur="7.22">holdups is people in the House</text>
  <text start="387.78" dur="9.38">Intelligence Committee want to attach a</text>
  <text start="391.94" dur="8.89">extension of the FISA 7:02 surveillance</text>
  <text start="397.16" dur="9.789">provision which is scheduled to sunset</text>
  <text start="400.83" dur="8.25">I believe December 31st and there are</text>
  <text start="406.949" dur="4.321">certain Rand Paul number one and there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="409.08" dur="5.01">other people are saying Rand Paul has</text>
  <text start="411.27" dur="4.619">said wolf I&amp;#39;ll filibuster what any bill</text>
  <text start="414.09" dur="5.37">that comes up that is going to allow</text>
  <text start="415.889" dur="7.351">FISA 702 to continue unchanged</text>
  <text start="419.46" dur="5.76">it can&amp;#39;t happen he is all about privacy</text>
  <text start="423.24" dur="4.5">and he doesn&amp;#39;t like government intrusion</text>
  <text start="425.22" dur="6.27">and he doesn&amp;#39;t like illegal surveillance</text>
  <text start="427.74" dur="7.169">on American citizens so if they try to</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="7.109">attach an extension of the FISA 702 onto</text>
  <text start="434.909" dur="5.971">the onto a spending bill it may be</text>
  <text start="438.599" dur="4.981">doomed for some some bad time so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="4.17">to see how that works out I I have every</text>
  <text start="443.58" dur="2.7">confidence that in the next two days</text>
  <text start="445.05" dur="3.269">they&amp;#39;ll work something out that will</text>
  <text start="446.28" dur="4.02">that will fund the government and there</text>
  <text start="448.319" dur="4.53">won&amp;#39;t be a shutdown probably I really</text>
  <text start="450.3" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t see that happening but I&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="452.849" dur="6.03">to stay tuned see what happens for who</text>
  <text start="456.21" dur="5.13">for those who are interested I think</text>
  <text start="458.879" dur="6.451">this sudden interest in UFOs especially</text>
  <text start="461.34" dur="6.6">on Twitter and social media the sudden</text>
  <text start="465.33" dur="5.97">interest in UFOs I think is a</text>
  <text start="467.94" dur="5.729">distraction I think is a conversation</text>
  <text start="471.3" dur="5.04">that certain people have planted into</text>
  <text start="473.669" dur="4.65">social media to distract people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="476.34" dur="4.74">attention away from some bigger more</text>
  <text start="478.319" dur="5.311">important things that are going on this</text>
  <text start="481.08" dur="5.88">is a time when we need to keep our eye</text>
  <text start="483.63" dur="7.14">on the ball and do not get distracted by</text>
  <text start="486.96" dur="5.759">shiny things out there because they are</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="5.429">throwing shiny things out there for us</text>
  <text start="492.719" dur="4.891">to focus on and we need to not look at</text>
  <text start="496.199" dur="4.56">the shiny things we need to focus on</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="5.029">what&amp;#39;s happening in the government in</text>
  <text start="500.759" dur="5.071">the FBI and Department of Justice and</text>
  <text start="502.639" dur="5.051">with it that&amp;#39;s what we need to be</text>
  <text start="505.83" dur="3.5">focused on don&amp;#39;t be distracted by other</text>
  <text start="507.69" dur="5.159">things that they&amp;#39;re throwing out they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="509.33" dur="4.54">trying to divert our attention away from</text>
  <text start="512.849" dur="3.961">more important things</text>
  <text start="513.87" dur="5.849">so Andrew speaking of FBI Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="516.81" dur="5.279">so the Deputy Director of the FBI goes</text>
  <text start="519.719" dur="4.56">before the House Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="522.089" dur="5.071">last night testified for seven and a</text>
  <text start="524.279" dur="6.201">half hours a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="527.16" dur="3.32">he would show up and he did show up</text>
  <text start="530.959" dur="6.61">James Rosen with Fox had an</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="4.77">exclusive article that he posted it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="537.569" dur="3.901">my Twitter timeline where he talked a</text>
  <text start="539.37" dur="6.42">little bit about what he was told that</text>
  <text start="541.47" dur="6.869">came out of that hearing mccabe did</text>
  <text start="545.79" dur="4.919">answer some questions the most</text>
  <text start="548.339" dur="5.131">interesting thing that Rosen thought</text>
  <text start="550.709" dur="5.49">that came out of that was that McCabe is</text>
  <text start="553.47" dur="5.34">standing by the veracity of the steel</text>
  <text start="556.199" dur="5.031">dossier he&amp;#39;s defending the steel dossier</text>
  <text start="558.81" dur="6.269">and he is saying this is a legitimate</text>
  <text start="561.23" dur="6.219">dossier it&amp;#39;s factual and when he was</text>
  <text start="565.079" dur="6.091">asked what evidence he had that the</text>
  <text start="567.449" dur="6.181">steel dossier was factual he pointed to</text>
  <text start="571.17" dur="4.979">Carter page having some relationship</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="5.1">with Russians that was all he was able</text>
  <text start="576.149" dur="4.5">to talk about that verified the steel</text>
  <text start="578.73" dur="4.74">dossier when they asked him for more</text>
  <text start="580.649" dur="5.781">information he didn&amp;#39;t have any so McCabe</text>
  <text start="583.47" dur="6.75">is doubling down on this steel dossier I</text>
  <text start="586.43" dur="7.63">think because they used that to get the</text>
  <text start="590.22" dur="8.75">702 to surveil Trump&amp;#39;s team and if he</text>
  <text start="594.06" dur="8.759">admits that that steel dossier is is a</text>
  <text start="598.97" dur="8.52">bunch of nonsense then they had no right</text>
  <text start="602.819" dur="7.95">if they use it for the to get the 702</text>
  <text start="607.49" dur="4.87">then their 702 was gotten illegally and</text>
  <text start="610.769" dur="3.661">they&amp;#39;re all in trouble so he can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="612.36" dur="4.26">really tell the truth about that thing</text>
  <text start="614.43" dur="6.81">he has to back it up and there are some</text>
  <text start="616.62" dur="6.63">other things trey Gowdy and Goodlett so</text>
  <text start="621.24" dur="6.44">wrote a letter and I think they send it</text>
  <text start="623.25" dur="6.66">sent it to mmm Department of Justice I</text>
  <text start="627.68" dur="4.3">have that on my Twitter timeline too</text>
  <text start="629.91" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re going to interview and subpoena</text>
  <text start="631.98" dur="3.75">more people including interestingly</text>
  <text start="634.41" dur="5.099">enough James Baker</text>
  <text start="635.73" dur="7.56">so James Baker is going to be dragged</text>
  <text start="639.509" dur="6.031">back into this Baker is the chief</text>
  <text start="643.29" dur="5.7">counsel for the FBI he is the head</text>
  <text start="645.54" dur="6.149">attorney for the FBI he was entered into</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="6.63">the disciplinary process back in July</text>
  <text start="651.689" dur="6.57">according to Sarah Carter he he got</text>
  <text start="655.62" dur="5.219">himself in trouble and he did some not</text>
  <text start="658.259" dur="5.341">cool things well he is apparently going</text>
  <text start="660.839" dur="5.011">to be appearing before the probably the</text>
