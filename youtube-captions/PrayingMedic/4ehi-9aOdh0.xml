  <text start="28.71" dur="4.38">sanctions and other pressures are</text>

  <text start="86.67" dur="4.8">looks like China is pretending to honor</text>
  <text start="89.27" dur="5.26">the economic sanctions but kind of</text>
  <text start="91.47" dur="5.399">behind the our back they&amp;#39;re still giving</text>
  <text start="94.53" dur="3.93">aid to North Korea so Trump is not happy</text>
  <text start="96.869" dur="5.04">about that he&amp;#39;s tweeted about that this</text>
  <text start="98.46" dur="6.14">week I will want to say one thing about</text>

  <text start="126.18" dur="5.309">over the last four or five days they are</text>
  <text start="129.33" dur="3.79">evaluating this they do not believe it</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="3.791">is an immediate threat or any</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="5.85">for us to worry about so just wanted to</text>
  <text start="135.28" dur="7.14">pass that along in North Korea it&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="138.97" dur="5.64">of where we stand right now Pakistan so</text>
  <text start="142.42" dur="4.77">the president tweeted about Pakistan and</text>
  <text start="144.61" dur="7.11">the and whether we should be giving them</text>
  <text start="147.19" dur="6.75">aid nikki Haley did confirm today that</text>
  <text start="151.72" dur="4.98">we are going to withhold two hundred</text>
  <text start="153.94" dur="7.62">twenty five million dollars in military</text>
  <text start="156.7" dur="7.289">aid to Pakistan as we review their level</text>
  <text start="161.56" dur="3.6">of cooperation in fighting terrorism the</text>
  <text start="163.989" dur="3.09">president talked about it</text>
  <text start="165.16" dur="3.09">Sarah Huckabee Sanders talked about it</text>
  <text start="167.079" dur="1.831">nikki Haley gave an address this</text>
  <text start="168.25" dur="4.59">afternoon</text>
  <text start="168.91" dur="6.51">and as a result of us withholding the</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="3.959">military aid to Pakistan their National</text>
  <text start="175.42" dur="3.84">Security Council called an emergency</text>
  <text start="176.799" dur="4.951">session so Pakistan is a little bit</text>
  <text start="179.26" dur="4.74">freaked out about that rightfully so if</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="6.93">they are not doing what they should be</text>
  <text start="184" dur="6.29">doing to give up terrorists well why</text>
  <text start="188.68" dur="6.559">should we give them financial aid and</text>
  <text start="190.29" dur="8.74">that&amp;#39;s the president&amp;#39;s position and</text>
  <text start="195.239" dur="6.641">interesting the president just tweeted</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="6.329">out about ten minutes ago a similar</text>
  <text start="201.88" dur="5.189">tweet about Palestine he and this is the</text>
  <text start="205.359" dur="4.081">Twitter&amp;#39;s two tweets actually I put them</text>
  <text start="207.069" dur="4.381">on my timeline and on Twitter it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="209.44" dur="4.53">only Pakistan that we pay billions of</text>
  <text start="211.45" dur="6.06">dollars to for nothing also many other</text>
  <text start="213.97" dur="5.519">countries and as an example we pay</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="3.86">Palestinians hundreds of millions of</text>
  <text start="219.489" dur="4.56">dollars a year and get no appreciation</text>
  <text start="221.37" dur="4.57">no respect they don&amp;#39;t even want to</text>
  <text start="224.049" dur="4.891">negotiate a long overdue peace treaty</text>
  <text start="225.94" dur="4.979">with Israel we have taken Jerusalem the</text>
  <text start="228.94" dur="4.32">toughest part of the negotiation off the</text>
  <text start="230.919" dur="4.861">table but Israel for that would have to</text>
  <text start="233.26" dur="4.8">pay a lot more but with the Palestinians</text>
  <text start="235.78" dur="4.019">no longer willing to talk peace why</text>
  <text start="238.06" dur="4.98">should we make any of these massive</text>
  <text start="239.799" dur="5.131">future payments to them so the president</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="4.65">is now calling into question why should</text>
  <text start="244.93" dur="4.949">we be giving aid to all these countries</text>
  <text start="247.69" dur="4.35">who are not willing to negotiate in good</text>
  <text start="249.879" dur="4.44">faith they&amp;#39;re doing nothing for us</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="4.259">they&amp;#39;re harboring terrorists why should</text>
  <text start="254.319" dur="4.651">we give you money so that you can do</text>
  <text start="256.299" dur="5.22">that so the president is getting tough</text>
  <text start="258.97" dur="6.199">on these countries that we&amp;#39;re giving aid</text>
  <text start="261.519" dur="3.65">to and they&amp;#39;re harboring terrorists</text>
  <text start="265.24" dur="2.73">we&amp;#39;re turn</text>
