  <text start="132.75" dur="3.8">dangerous</text>
  <text start="133.58" dur="6.24">president if it would be unprecedented</text>
  <text start="136.55" dur="7.44">or as Trump would say unprecedented</text>

  <text start="227.39" dur="7.59">15th 2018 to the Judiciary Committee now</text>
  <text start="231.53" dur="6.12">a lot of you know that the Office of</text>
  <text start="234.98" dur="3.96">Inspector General has been investigating</text>
  <text start="237.65" dur="4.65">the Department of Justice and the FBI</text>
  <text start="238.94" dur="5.4">over politicization or what I would say</text>
  <text start="242.3" dur="4.74">weaponization of those departments</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="6.929">during the election and the Hillary</text>

  <text start="269.42" dur="3.24">million people that the board has</text>
  <text start="270.65" dur="4.35">reached now I believe it was with the</text>
  <text start="272.66" dur="3.63">1.2 million documents that the Office of</text>
  <text start="275" dur="5.55">Inspector General has on this</text>
  <text start="276.29" dur="7.17">investigation now the if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>

  <text start="283.46" dur="5.01">the Office of Inspector General is due</text>
  <text start="285.44" dur="4.82">to release their final report sometime</text>
  <text start="288.47" dur="6.42">around March or April</text>
  <text start="290.26" dur="6.34">but the 1.2 million pages if compiled in</text>

  <text start="296.6" dur="4.19">released to the House Judiciary</text>
  <text start="298.22" dur="7.83">Committee in a couple of weeks on</text>
  <text start="300.79" dur="9.96">January 15th did you know that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="306.05" dur="8.54">important this is why it&amp;#39;s important so</text>
  <text start="310.75" dur="6.58">under under testimony Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="314.59" dur="4.45">affirmed that the investigative</text>
  <text start="317.33" dur="3.77">documents would be released to chairman</text>
  <text start="319.04" dur="5.81">Goodlatte and house investigators and</text>
  <text start="321.1" dur="6.04">this is the backdrop we have to look at</text>
  <text start="324.85" dur="5.68">considering McCabe&amp;#39;s decision to retire</text>
  <text start="327.14" dur="4.98">the Inspector General may or may not be</text>
  <text start="330.53" dur="4.2">complete with his investigative report</text>
  <text start="332.12" dur="5.61">on our January 15th however House</text>
  <text start="334.73" dur="6.33">Oversight trey Gowdy and Judiciary</text>
  <text start="337.73" dur="5.82">Goodlatte committees are both launching</text>
  <text start="341.06" dur="4.35">investigations and they&amp;#39;re not waiting</text>
  <text start="343.55" dur="4.92">for the Inspector General to conclude</text>
  <text start="345.41" dur="6.72">his final report the Office of Inspector</text>
  <text start="348.47" dur="6.23">General Horowitz and Congress oversight</text>
  <text start="352.13" dur="5.34">and Judiciary cannot independently file</text>
  <text start="354.7" dur="5.65">criminal indictments based on their</text>
  <text start="357.47" dur="4.29">investigative outcomes that decision is</text>
  <text start="360.35" dur="6.78">up to the Department of Justice the</text>
  <text start="361.76" dur="7.47">reason Goodlatte has requested the 1.2</text>
  <text start="367.13" dur="6.51">million pages of investigative documents</text>
  <text start="369.23" dur="7.05">is because a special prosecutor bring</text>
  <text start="373.64" dur="5.82">criminal indictments here&amp;#39;s where we see</text>
  <text start="376.28" dur="6.21">the clarity of Horowitz and Goodlatte</text>
  <text start="379.46" dur="8.61">working together now I&amp;#39;m going to play</text>

  <text start="559.15" dur="6.72">on the documents of the OIG report this</text>
  <text start="562.42" dur="5.58">creates two options for Jeff Sessions in</text>
  <text start="565.87" dur="5.64">the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="568" dur="7.02">number one the special prosecutor goes</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="5.37">forward and toward indictments based on</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="5.79">the Office of Inspector General findings</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="6.3">and their year-long investigation option</text>
  <text start="580.81" dur="5.04">two a new Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="583.18" dur="5.52">investigation assigned toward criminal</text>
  <text start="585.85" dur="6.12">indictments again using the OIG findings</text>
  <text start="588.7" dur="6.93">from Horowitz and his investigation both</text>
  <text start="591.97" dur="5.88">options become fully available after the</text>
  <text start="595.63" dur="5.57">Inspector General releases his report</text>
  <text start="597.85" dur="6.24">which may be March or April however</text>
  <text start="601.2" dur="6.55">prior to Horowitz releasing his report</text>
  <text start="604.09" dur="6.24">the first option of prosecution is</text>
  <text start="607.75" dur="5.67">available based on the interim findings</text>

  <text start="613.42" dur="6.02">going to be released on January 15th</text>
  <text start="616.74" dur="5.53">both routes a special prosecutor</text>
  <text start="619.44" dur="6.34">investigation assigned by Congress or</text>
  <text start="622.27" dur="5.7">criminal probe by sessions end in the</text>
  <text start="625.78" dur="6.57">same place where indictments are likely</text>
  <text start="627.97" dur="6.4">now remember Congress can appoint a</text>
  <text start="632.35" dur="5.02">special prosecutor as well</text>
  <text start="634.37" dur="5.76">the Department of Justice the difference</text>
  <text start="637.37" dur="5.159">between these two routes is time however</text>
  <text start="640.13" dur="5.07">neither investigation will require too</text>
  <text start="642.529" dur="4.441">much time or investigation because</text>
  <text start="645.2" dur="4.31">Horowitz has been investigating for a</text>
  <text start="646.97" dur="7.02">year and they have 1.2 million pages of</text>
  <text start="649.51" dur="8.44">documents either the congressional</text>
  <text start="653.99" dur="6.39">special prosecutor route or the DOJ</text>
  <text start="657.95" dur="4.41">prosecutor route will only require the</text>
  <text start="660.38" dur="4.14">prosecutor to conduct interviews to</text>
  <text start="662.36" dur="3.66">enhance the already massive amount of</text>
  <text start="664.52" dur="4.59">information that Horowitz has already</text>
  <text start="666.02" dur="6.39">provided the bottom line is the jig is</text>
  <text start="669.11" dur="6.169">up the ruse is exposed the plot is</text>
  <text start="672.41" dur="8.04">evident president Trump&amp;#39;s tweets today</text>

  <text start="708.56" dur="6.24">looks to me like the Judiciary Committee</text>
  <text start="712.91" dur="5.34">is probably moving toward indictment</text>
  <text start="714.8" dur="6.99">before McCabe is able to retire but I</text>
  <text start="718.25" dur="6.24">think that&amp;#39;s the the summary of where</text>

  <text start="727.43" dur="3.349">it looks like goodlet and the Judiciary</text>
