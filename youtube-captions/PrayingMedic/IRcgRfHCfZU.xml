  <text start="184.95" dur="4.89">yesterday morning President Trump tweets</text>
  <text start="187.5" dur="3.87">out how bad a good lawyer could make a</text>
  <text start="189.84" dur="4.56">great case out of the fact that</text>
  <text start="191.37" dur="5.22">President Obama was tapping my phones in</text>
  <text start="194.4" dur="3.3">October just prior to the election how</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="4.05">low has he gone</text>
  <text start="197.7" dur="4.98">to tap my phones during the sacred</text>
  <text start="200.64" dur="3.9">election process okay you could take one</text>
  <text start="202.68" dur="4.589">of two two viewpoints on what President</text>
  <text start="204.54" dur="6.779">Trump is trying to do with these tweets</text>
  <text start="207.269" dur="6.091">some people think he is reckless and</text>
  <text start="211.319" dur="3.691">careless and thoughtless with his</text>
  <text start="213.36" dur="3.27">Twitter account people you know</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="2.819">complainings someone should be</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="3.689">monitoring it someone else would be</text>
  <text start="217.829" dur="4.74">doing it look here&amp;#39;s the thing you have</text>
  <text start="220.319" dur="4.831">to understand this about about the</text>
  <text start="222.569" dur="5.521">president he&amp;#39;s well advised he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="225.15" dur="5.25">very smart people advising him I would</text>
  <text start="228.09" dur="5.489">imagine most of the stuff he puts on</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="5.52">Twitter he is getting legal advice from</text>
  <text start="233.579" dur="5.961">his attorneys before he does it if the</text>
  <text start="235.92" dur="6.84">president tweets out something that is</text>
  <text start="239.54" dur="4.84">classified he can be a peached you you</text>
  <text start="242.76" dur="6.449">can&amp;#39;t give out classified information</text>
  <text start="244.38" dur="8.37">publicly so I suspect that he is being</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="6.39">well coached on what is going on in</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="5.76">Twitter why does he do it this is this</text>
  <text start="255.599" dur="4.021">whole thing of President Trump being on</text>
  <text start="258.51" dur="4.89">Twitter it is</text>
  <text start="259.62" dur="6.03">psyops it is psychological warfare if</text>
  <text start="263.4" dur="4.8">you do not understand that you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="265.65" dur="4.5">be frustrated or angry or confused about</text>
  <text start="268.2" dur="5.189">why he&amp;#39;s using Twitter it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="270.15" dur="6.21">psychological warfare he has to counter</text>
  <text start="273.389" dur="4.621">a large group of people that are trying</text>
  <text start="276.36" dur="4.02">to stop what he&amp;#39;s doing</text>
  <text start="278.01" dur="5.08">including the mainstream media and a lot</text>
  <text start="280.38" dur="5.44">of people in the deep state he</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="4.41">using Twitter as a weapon of</text>
  <text start="285.82" dur="4.04">psychological warfare thing about</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="6.57">psychological warfare is we tend to</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="7.3">think of that as a weapon that is used</text>
  <text start="294.07" dur="5.34">to manipulate and control and it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="297.16" dur="4.86">evil thing it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be and</text>
  <text start="299.41" dur="2.97">every president uses psychological</text>
  <text start="302.02" dur="2.97">warfare</text>
  <text start="302.38" dur="7.02">we call it warfare but what it is really</text>
  <text start="304.99" dur="7.23">is its its its leadership when I go on</text>
  <text start="309.4" dur="5.61">Facebook and I do video like like this</text>
  <text start="312.22" dur="4.98">I&amp;#39;m trying to influence people who are</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="4.86">having a public conversation I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="317.2" dur="5.79">to shape narrative shape the culture in</text>
  <text start="319.87" dur="5.85">in a sense when I do a video I&amp;#39;m using</text>
  <text start="322.99" dur="7.83">psychological warfare when you present</text>
  <text start="325.72" dur="7.38">opinions ideas facts bias lies so in a</text>
  <text start="330.82" dur="5.34">public platform that is called</text>
  <text start="333.1" dur="6.24">psychological warfare okay it is using</text>
  <text start="336.16" dur="5.49">information to accomplish an objective a</text>
  <text start="339.34" dur="4.71">strategic objective and that is what</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="5.19">President Trump is doing with Twitter he</text>
  <text start="344.05" dur="4.92">and Sean Spicer and all the people on</text>
  <text start="346.84" dur="5.01">Twitter the mainstream media they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="348.97" dur="4.699">trying to shape the public narrative by</text>
  <text start="351.85" dur="4.35">the things they put out on social media</text>
  <text start="353.669" dur="4.801">people you look at his Twitter feed and</text>
  <text start="356.2" dur="4.529">think that is a mess what is he doing</text>
  <text start="358.47" dur="5.59">everything he puts on Twitter is</text>
  <text start="360.729" dur="6.841">strategic this is a game a very</text>
  <text start="364.06" dur="5.789">strategic game of chess now let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="367.57" dur="4.59">back to the wiretapping here&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="369.849" dur="4.351">that you should think about when</text>
  <text start="372.16" dur="4.11">President Trump got on Twitter yesterday</text>
  <text start="374.2" dur="2.76">morning and tweeted out the wiretapping</text>
  <text start="376.27" dur="3.3">tweets</text>
  <text start="376.96" dur="4.11">it wasn&amp;#39;t like general Flynn called him</text>
  <text start="379.57" dur="3.45">at three o&amp;#39;clock in the morning and said</text>
  <text start="381.07" dur="6.38">hey Don did you know that you were</text>
  <text start="383.02" dur="7.86">wiretapped this is not new information</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="4.96">this is old information this is old news</text>
  <text start="390.88" dur="4.17">they have known this for a long time</text>
  <text start="392.41" dur="4.41">this stuff has been reported on in the</text>
  <text start="395.05" dur="3.839">New York Times in a Washington Post and</text>
  <text start="396.82" dur="3.3">other mainstream news outlets they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="398.889" dur="3">been reporting on this</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;ve been leaking some of this</text>
  <text start="401.889" dur="3.75">information it&amp;#39;s been going on for</text>
  <text start="403.63" dur="3.93">months the first thing we need to</text>
  <text start="405.639" dur="6.09">understand it this is the wiretapping</text>
  <text start="407.56" dur="5.96">thing is not new news it is something</text>
  <text start="411.729" dur="4.43">that Donald Trump decided it was</text>
  <text start="413.52" dur="4.229">strategically time to bring it up now</text>
  <text start="416.159" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s strategically tied because</text>
  <text start="417.749" dur="5.45">President Trump Steve Bannon and his</text>
  <text start="420.929" dur="5.85">team they&amp;#39;re trying to accomplish</text>
  <text start="423.199" dur="6.31">objectives this tweet was not random</text>
  <text start="426.779" dur="5.551">this was not random the strategic goal</text>
  <text start="429.509" dur="6.42">of these tweets is to put the opposition</text>
  <text start="432.33" dur="7.829">unnotice they&amp;#39;re letting them know now</text>
  <text start="435.929" dur="6.51">we are going to play hardball we wanted</text>
  <text start="440.159" dur="4.56">to use a military a metaphor for what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="442.439" dur="4.68">going on what has been happening up</text>
  <text start="444.719" dur="5.55">until now is small arms fire</text>
  <text start="447.119" dur="5.64">lots of handguns small arms fire being</text>
  <text start="450.269" dur="3.89">exchanged nothing really big the tweets</text>
  <text start="452.759" dur="6.601">that the president put out yesterday</text>
  <text start="454.159" dur="7.78">amount to picking up the m60 machine gun</text>
  <text start="459.36" dur="5.22">and using the machine gun or maybe a</text>
  <text start="461.939" dur="5.91">rocket-propelled grenade RPG larger</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="6.03">weapons not the howitzer and not the</text>
  <text start="467.849" dur="5.49">nuclear weapons but larger weapons are</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="4.529">now being used okay this will help us</text>
  <text start="473.339" dur="4.021">understand where we&amp;#39;re at in the process</text>
  <text start="475.139" dur="4.95">this is a process we&amp;#39;re gonna watch play</text>
  <text start="477.36" dur="6.719">out over the next couple of years it is</text>
  <text start="480.089" dur="6.78">going to be a long involved process so</text>
  <text start="484.079" dur="7.08">what is going on the president Trump</text>
  <text start="486.869" dur="6.871">accused President Obama of having him</text>
  <text start="491.159" dur="5.79">under electronic surveillance so the</text>
  <text start="493.74" dur="4.769">first thing we need to do we need to</text>
  <text start="496.949" dur="6.45">find out is did that actually happen</text>
  <text start="498.509" dur="6.24">is it true well of course it&amp;#39;s true he</text>
  <text start="503.399" dur="3.12">wouldn&amp;#39;t tweet it out if it wasn&amp;#39;t true</text>
  <text start="504.749" dur="3.18">but love me let me tell you how we know</text>
  <text start="506.519" dur="3.091">that it&amp;#39;s do we know that we know that</text>
  <text start="507.929" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s true you don&amp;#39;t just say well Trump</text>
  <text start="509.61" dur="3.059">said it therefore it has to be true but</text>
  <text start="511.229" dur="3.571">you have to go and do some research and</text>
  <text start="512.669" dur="5.191">find out if it&amp;#39;s true so there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="514.8" dur="5.31">of confusion did he do it illegally did</text>
  <text start="517.86" dur="3.719">he have a warrant what does that whole</text>
  <text start="520.11" dur="4.5">Pro so I&amp;#39;m going to right now I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="521.579" dur="7.31">to break down that whole process and</text>
  <text start="524.61" dur="7.14">explain to you how the process happened</text>
  <text start="528.889" dur="5.711">what the liabilities are for both</text>
  <text start="531.75" dur="5.61">parties involved and I&amp;#39;m going to give</text>
  <text start="534.6" dur="4.919">you a lot of in-depth legal information</text>
  <text start="537.36" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m not a lawyer but I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of</text>
  <text start="539.519" dur="3.63">research so just bear with me for the</text>
  <text start="541.68" dur="5.59">next 15 minutes and I&amp;#39;ll try to unpack</text>
  <text start="543.149" dur="9.341">all this in the spring of last year</text>
  <text start="547.27" dur="7.74">some cybersecurity experts were doing</text>
  <text start="552.49" dur="4.98">some random experiments and they</text>
  <text start="555.01" dur="4.86">accidentally found communications</text>
  <text start="557.47" dur="5.13">between a server and Donnellan that was</text>
  <text start="559.87" dur="4.83">registered to Donald Trump and a bank in</text>
  <text start="562.6" dur="3.75">Russia they just found this by accident</text>
  <text start="564.7" dur="3.509">they didn&amp;#39;t know exactly what was going</text>
  <text start="566.35" dur="3.15">on they thought well this is strange</text>
  <text start="568.209" dur="3.63">eating know if it was legitimate they</text>
  <text start="569.5" dur="4.98">just saw that there is a server in a</text>
  <text start="571.839" dur="4.861">bank in Russia that was pinging a server</text>
  <text start="574.48" dur="5.19">that was registered to Donald Trump into</text>
  <text start="576.7" dur="4.889">his Trump Tower at Fifth Avenue so these</text>
  <text start="579.67" dur="4.109">researchers are like oh that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="581.589" dur="4.111">interesting so they they were they</text>
  <text start="583.779" dur="3.691">watched it through this spring and the</text>
  <text start="585.7" dur="3.99">summer to find out what was going on and</text>
  <text start="587.47" dur="5.07">they never really were able to determine</text>
  <text start="589.69" dur="5.459">what that activity was all about but</text>
  <text start="592.54" dur="5.46">they started talking about it on reddit</text>
  <text start="595.149" dur="5.011">and some other channels and it popped up</text>
  <text start="598" dur="5.13">on the radar of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="600.16" dur="6.83">community sometime before last June</text>
  <text start="603.13" dur="6.45">probably March or April possibly May</text>
  <text start="606.99" dur="6.61">it&amp;#39;s likely we don&amp;#39;t know this for sure</text>
  <text start="609.58" dur="6.42">it&amp;#39;s likely that President Obama or</text>
  <text start="613.6" dur="4.59">someone in his administration whether</text>
  <text start="616" dur="5.55">that was the Attorney General</text>
  <text start="618.19" dur="6.899">FBI director we don&amp;#39;t know but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="621.55" dur="6.14">likely they tried to get a warrant to do</text>
  <text start="625.089" dur="5.101">surveillance on Donald Trump and</text>
  <text start="627.69" dur="4.389">somebody it&amp;#39;s and some were said no we</text>
  <text start="630.19" dur="4.05">can&amp;#39;t do we&amp;#39;re not gonna get the war the</text>
  <text start="632.079" dur="5.281">reason you say that is they had to go to</text>
  <text start="634.24" dur="4.89">extreme measures to get the warrant the</text>
  <text start="637.36" dur="4.56">first measure is you go to a federal</text>

  <text start="806.8" dur="5.73">requests for warrants through the FISA</text>
  <text start="809.92" dur="3.57">Court over the years only twelve of them</text>
  <text start="812.53" dur="2.31">have been denied</text>
  <text start="813.49" dur="3.6">almost</text>
  <text start="814.84" dur="4.32">always you&amp;#39;re going to get what you</text>
  <text start="817.09" dur="5.79">request when you go to FISA because</text>
  <text start="819.16" dur="6.75">there is a low bar for suspicion and</text>
  <text start="822.88" dur="4.92">there is a high suspicion of probability</text>
  <text start="825.91" dur="2.97">that there&amp;#39;s an immediate threat to</text>
  <text start="827.8" dur="5.94">national security</text>
  <text start="828.88" dur="6.93">that is why 99% of the time when the</text>
  <text start="833.74" dur="4.62">Department of Justice or FBI requests a</text>
  <text start="835.81" dur="4.74">warrant out of FISA Court it&amp;#39;s granted</text>
  <text start="838.36" dur="7.43">so that&amp;#39;s the background of the FISA</text>
  <text start="840.55" dur="7.89">Court and in June of last year when the</text>
  <text start="845.79" dur="4.35">Obama administration whether it was FBI</text>
  <text start="848.44" dur="7.59">or Department of Justice we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="850.14" dur="10.03">when they went and requested a FISA</text>
  <text start="856.03" dur="8.25">warrant for surveillance a Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="860.17" dur="7.41">it was rejected in October they went</text>
  <text start="864.28" dur="6.75">back with another FISA requests and they</text>
  <text start="867.58" dur="6.72">changed the wording of their request and</text>
  <text start="871.03" dur="6.66">they left out Donald Trump from the</text>
  <text start="874.3" dur="7.26">mention in the FISA requests all right</text>
  <text start="877.69" dur="6.24">Trump was mentioned in the first request</text>
  <text start="881.56" dur="4.89">but not in the second one and and this</text>
  <text start="883.93" dur="9.36">is probably why it was denied in June</text>
  <text start="886.45" dur="10.38">because FISA covers foreign citizens not</text>
  <text start="893.29" dur="5.67">US citizens if they wanted to get</text>
  <text start="896.83" dur="4.65">surveillance on a US citizen they would</text>
  <text start="898.96" dur="4.68">go to a regular federal court and get a</text>
  <text start="901.48" dur="6.33">warrant and the FISA Court knows that</text>
  <text start="903.64" dur="5.64">they took Trump out of the request for</text>
  <text start="907.81" dur="3.45">the warrant in October and it was</text>
  <text start="909.28" dur="4.95">approved now let me give you some more</text>
  <text start="911.26" dur="6.09">details about the warrant that was</text>

  <text start="968.05" dur="6.69">basis for getting the the warrant to</text>
  <text start="971.23" dur="7.29">look at Trump&amp;#39;s server in Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="974.74" dur="6.72">and that was approved now at least since</text>

  <text start="1049.56" dur="7.26">probably the NSA have been crawling all</text>

  <text start="1110.77" dur="5.16">you have to actually violate a couple of</text>

  <text start="1136.78" dur="6.6">that&amp;#39;s something to think about from</text>
  <text start="1139.72" dur="5.55">this point forward I think Trump now has</text>
  <text start="1143.38" dur="4.59">the upper hand and I&amp;#39;m going to continue</text>

  <text start="1226.49" dur="6.06">well let&amp;#39;s go back to the FISA and look</text>

  <text start="1237.35" dur="5.66">there is a lot of liability and let me</text>
