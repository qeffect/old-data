  <text start="11.04" dur="6.989">some good news the New York Federal</text>
  <text start="13.29" dur="7.68">Reserve boosted the projected GDP for</text>
  <text start="18.029" dur="6.33">the fourth quarter to three point nine</text>
  <text start="20.97" dur="6.059">eight percent almost four percent the</text>
  <text start="24.359" dur="5.49">New York Federal Reserve is predicting</text>
  <text start="27.029" dur="4.381">that the US GDP will reach almost four</text>
  <text start="29.849" dur="4.581">percent for the fourth quarter and</text>
  <text start="31.41" dur="6.18">that&amp;#39;s probably a conservative estimate</text>
  <text start="34.43" dur="5.469">I think we&amp;#39;ll beat four percent for GDP</text>
  <text start="37.59" dur="2.85">for the fourth quarter moving right</text>
  <text start="39.899" dur="5.461">along</text>
  <text start="40.44" dur="7.709">the tax bill has passed the House with</text>
  <text start="45.36" dur="4.92">votes to spare I think they had 18 17 18</text>
  <text start="48.149" dur="4.951">votes to spare it is moving on to the</text>
  <text start="50.28" dur="6.209">Senate they&amp;#39;re going to try to vote on</text>

  <text start="58.5" dur="5.25">hours to debate this tax bill in the</text>
  <text start="60.75" dur="5.729">Senate Mitch McConnell said it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="63.75" dur="5.58">to depend on how much time is yielded</text>
  <text start="66.479" dur="4.68">back after the debate they may be voting</text>
  <text start="69.33" dur="4.649">on a tomorrow morning they may vote on</text>
  <text start="71.159" dur="4.171">it late tonight not sure but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="73.979" dur="4.021">moving it in to the Senate for vote</text>
  <text start="75.33" dur="6.42">tonight I think they&amp;#39;re still on track</text>
  <text start="78" dur="7.59">to have the tax bills passed and on the</text>
  <text start="81.75" dur="5.729">President&amp;#39;s desk by Friday the second</text>
  <text start="85.59" dur="5.7">issue is the government shutdown they</text>
  <text start="87.479" dur="6.03">have the government funded through gosh</text>
  <text start="91.29" dur="4.5">Friday night I think the 22nd the</text>
  <text start="93.509" dur="5.701">government is funded through the 22nd</text>
  <text start="95.79" dur="4.53">after that no more money so there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="3.78">potential for a government shutdown</text>
  <text start="100.32" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re trying to avoid that so in</text>
  <text start="102.99" dur="3.989">addition to trying to get this tax bill</text>
  <text start="104.7" dur="5.129">passed they also have to pass a</text>
  <text start="106.979" dur="5.511">continuing resolution or a new budget</text>
  <text start="109.829" dur="5.991">bill to avoid a government shutdown so</text>
  <text start="112.49" dur="5.919">lots of balls in the air right now</text>
  <text start="115.82" dur="5.259">something you might want to pray about</text>
  <text start="118.409" dur="5.1">if you&amp;#39;re a praying person that this all</text>
  <text start="121.079" dur="6">slides through and everything goes okay</text>
  <text start="123.509" dur="5.181">without any glitches Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="127.079" dur="6.961">deputy director of the FBI</text>
  <text start="128.69" dur="6.79">Andrew McCabe did appear at his Herring</text>
  <text start="134.04" dur="4.98">in the House Intelligence Committee this</text>
  <text start="135.48" dur="5.24">afternoon and he is still behind closed</text>
  <text start="139.02" dur="4.049">doors they have a closed-door session</text>
  <text start="140.72" dur="5.11">House Intelligence Committee they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="143.069" dur="7.471">grilling him it&amp;#39;s probably going to be a</text>
  <text start="145.83" dur="6.51">very difficult interview and my guy on</text>
  <text start="150.54" dur="3.27">Twitter who I follow who reports on all</text>
  <text start="152.34" dur="2.759">this stuff said they&amp;#39;re still behind</text>
  <text start="153.81" dur="4.41">doors they&amp;#39;re expecting it to go into</text>
  <text start="155.099" dur="5.28">the early evening at least he showed up</text>
  <text start="158.22" dur="4.379">and it&amp;#39;s very likely he&amp;#39;ll plead the</text>
  <text start="160.379" dur="3.451">fifth on a lot of stuff if if they get</text>
  <text start="162.599" dur="3.271">around to asking criminais ting</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="4.11">questions if he&amp;#39;s smart hopefully the</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="3.899">fifth but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter because if</text>
  <text start="167.94" dur="4.74">they&amp;#39;re going to prosecute Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="169.769" dur="5.961">for wrongdoing what he says in this</text>
  <text start="172.68" dur="5.94">committee meeting may or may not impact</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="5.89">the prosecution all that much but they</text>
  <text start="178.62" dur="6.089">need to get him on record under oath and</text>
  <text start="181.62" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s part of the process we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="184.709" dur="9.181">talk about that process a little bit</text>
  <text start="185.97" dur="10.11">more later interesting development in</text>
  <text start="193.89" dur="5.959">James Comey and the email investigation</text>
  <text start="196.08" dur="8.28">with Hillary now if you remember back</text>
  <text start="199.849" dur="7.631">last year just before the election about</text>
  <text start="204.36" dur="4.26">a dozen days or so before the election</text>
  <text start="207.48" dur="3.3">Comey</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="5.699">suddenly reopened the email</text>
  <text start="210.78" dur="5.489">investigation and then they investigated</text>
  <text start="214.319" dur="4.081">these new emails for a few days and then</text>
  <text start="216.269" dur="5.371">they closed the investigation again and</text>
  <text start="218.4" dur="5.04">combing downst no wrongdoing not going</text>
  <text start="221.64" dur="4.17">to prosecute Hillary do you probably</text>
  <text start="223.44" dur="3.62">remember that and people were scratching</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="4.2">their head like how can you go through</text>
  <text start="227.06" dur="3.64">600,000 emails in a couple of days and</text>
  <text start="230.01" dur="4.02">determine it</text>
  <text start="230.7" dur="7.009">there&amp;#39;s no wrongdoing right it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="8.789">look like a very objective investigation</text>
  <text start="237.709" dur="7.84">so true pundit thomas paine has been</text>
  <text start="242.819" dur="4.261">getting all kinds of information from</text>
  <text start="245.549" dur="3.66">FBI agents they&amp;#39;re coming out of the</text>
  <text start="247.08" dur="4.5">woodwork to tell him what actually</text>
  <text start="249.209" dur="4.461">happened behind the scenes and if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="251.58" dur="5.79">okay I&amp;#39;m going to just summarize quickly</text>
  <text start="253.67" dur="7.18">some of the backstory that was not</text>
  <text start="257.37" dur="9.269">reported on what was going on with Comey</text>
  <text start="260.85" dur="8.099">and the email investigation so a</text>
  <text start="266.639" dur="8.041">let&amp;#39;s see this would have been early</text>
  <text start="268.949" dur="8.581">October New York field office agents FBI</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="5.85">agents got ahold of anthony Weiner&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="277.53" dur="10.319">laptop which had over 600,000 emails on</text>
  <text start="280.53" dur="9.75">it and they reported the the computer</text>
  <text start="287.849" dur="6.901">and the emails up the chain of command</text>
  <text start="290.28" dur="9.439">to Peter Strock who is deputy and for</text>
  <text start="294.75" dur="6.27">counterintelligence and to Andrew McCabe</text>
  <text start="299.719" dur="3.85">all right</text>
  <text start="301.02" dur="6.81">they got notified that the FBI field</text>
  <text start="303.569" dur="10.65">agents in New York had weiners laptop 12</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="10.309">or 13 days go by and nothing happens</text>
  <text start="314.219" dur="6.331">McCabe and Strock sit on this</text>
  <text start="318.139" dur="6.34">information about weiners laptop and the</text>
  <text start="320.55" dur="5.639">emails they were thinking let&amp;#39;s just get</text>
  <text start="324.479" dur="3.69">past the election which is going to be</text>
  <text start="326.189" dur="3.84">in a month and then we&amp;#39;ll deal with this</text>
  <text start="328.169" dur="3.72">later we don&amp;#39;t want to reopen this</text>
  <text start="330.029" dur="4.531">because it&amp;#39;s going because Hillary is</text>
  <text start="331.889" dur="4.351">leading in the polls and if they reopen</text>
  <text start="334.56" dur="4.139">the investigation right before the</text>
  <text start="336.24" dur="5.31">election it&amp;#39;s going to tank Hillary and</text>
  <text start="338.699" dur="5.31">she may risk losing the election so</text>
  <text start="341.55" dur="4.109">Andrew McCabe and struck didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="344.009" dur="4.56">telling me what they had to do is they</text>
  <text start="345.659" dur="5.07">had to get warrants in order to use the</text>
  <text start="348.569" dur="3.72">emails that were on weiners laptop for</text>
  <text start="350.729" dur="3.481">prosecution they had to get a warrant</text>
  <text start="352.289" dur="5.88">and they didn&amp;#39;t have one and they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="354.21" dur="7.109">want to get one in a meeting late in</text>
  <text start="358.169" dur="7.02">October I think it was October 27th and</text>
  <text start="361.319" dur="9.27">a staff meeting Comey finds out about</text>
  <text start="365.189" dur="6.84">weiners laptop now struck and McCabe had</text>
  <text start="370.589" dur="5.33">this information for weeks but they</text>
  <text start="372.029" dur="8.341">didn&amp;#39;t tell Co me and Comey panics and</text>
  <text start="375.919" dur="6.581">he&amp;#39;s like oh my gosh we have like 12</text>
  <text start="380.37" dur="5.4">days before the election or 13 days and</text>
  <text start="382.5" dur="5.58">now there&amp;#39;s this information comes out</text>
  <text start="385.77" dur="3.75">that there&amp;#39;s this laptop with Hillary</text>
  <text start="388.08" dur="5.85">emails on it that hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="389.52" dur="6.959">investigated and if he doesn&amp;#39;t add up</text>
  <text start="393.93" dur="5.25">reopen the investigation and look</text>
  <text start="396.479" dur="3.93">through the emails they will be accused</text>
  <text start="399.18" dur="3.229">if it ever comes out</text>
  <text start="400.409" dur="6.391">they&amp;#39;ll be accused of covering up the</text>
  <text start="402.409" dur="6.79">emails before the election so he had a</text>
  <text start="406.8" dur="5.31">very difficult job they knew about the</text>
  <text start="409.199" dur="5.131">emails they if they open up the</text>
  <text start="412.11" dur="5.579">investigation they risk</text>
  <text start="414.33" dur="5.429">Hillary losing the election but the</text>
  <text start="417.689" dur="5.97">other risk was being exposed for</text>
  <text start="419.759" dur="6.06">covering up the emails so they open the</text>
  <text start="423.659" dur="5.701">investigation again take a couple of</text>
  <text start="425.819" dur="5.55">days close the investigation no</text>
  <text start="429.36" dur="3.899">prosecution and they let the election go</text>
  <text start="431.369" dur="6.87">hoping that it didn&amp;#39;t do enough damage</text>
  <text start="433.259" dur="7.97">to Hillary&amp;#39;s numbers to have her lose</text>
  <text start="438.239" dur="10.7">the election and of course it did</text>
  <text start="441.229" dur="11.321">Hillary lost the electoral college and</text>
  <text start="448.939" dur="4.84">Trump won the election and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="3.389">coming out that there was some</text>
  <text start="453.779" dur="4.35">behind-the-scenes stuff with the email</text>
  <text start="455.939" dur="5.19">that essentially they knew about the</text>
  <text start="458.129" dur="6.06">emails but they didn&amp;#39;t tell Comey about</text>
  <text start="461.129" dur="5.25">them that&amp;#39;s what true pundit is</text>
  <text start="464.189" dur="4.2">reporting if you want information on</text>
  <text start="466.379" dur="4.88">what&amp;#39;s going on and said the FBI true</text>
  <text start="468.389" dur="5.76">pundit thomas paine has good sources</text>
  <text start="471.259" dur="8.13">i&amp;#39;ve been following the stories there</text>
  <text start="474.149" dur="9.75">and it&amp;#39;s pretty interesting information</text>

  <text start="843.39" dur="5.54">out in front of the news cycle to create</text>
  <text start="845.91" dur="7.41">a little more hysteria about Russia</text>
  <text start="848.93" dur="7">that&amp;#39;s my take on it and I do think I I</text>
  <text start="853.32" dur="4.62">i expect that Muller&amp;#39;s investigation is</text>
  <text start="855.93" dur="4.76">gonna we&amp;#39;re gonna hear something pretty</text>
  <text start="857.94" dur="5.67">quickly from that Trump has been</text>
  <text start="860.69" dur="5.68">trolling CNN and a few other people</text>
  <text start="863.61" dur="3.96">telling them that he knows he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="866.37" dur="5.93">confident that Moe is gonna exonerate</text>
  <text start="867.57" dur="8.73">him now how often has Trump trolled CNN</text>
  <text start="872.3" dur="7.24">over the last year and every single time</text>
  <text start="876.3" dur="6.659">he throws the bait out there they latch</text>

  <text start="882.959" dur="6.421">is so good at trolling CNN they always</text>
  <text start="885.899" dur="6.18">fall for the same tricks so I think if</text>
  <text start="889.38" dur="4.62">if Trump is telling his friends that</text>
  <text start="892.079" dur="3.841">he&amp;#39;s telling CNN that he&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="894" dur="5.52">cleared he knows something he already</text>

  <text start="901.26" dur="4.439">he can make them look stupid so I think</text>
  <text start="904.11" dur="10.14">we&amp;#39;re gonna have some amusing headlines</text>
  <text start="905.699" dur="10.7">in the next few days Trump is really</text>

  <text start="924.48" dur="5.49">second editorial let me give you my</text>
  <text start="927.63" dur="5.04">first editorial so a couple of my</text>
  <text start="929.97" dur="4.65">friends have been asking me well would</text>
  <text start="932.67" dur="5.25">you do an update on pizza gate</text>
  <text start="934.62" dur="5.94">would you do an up and and I I think the</text>
  <text start="937.92" dur="5.88">term pizza gate is unfortunate because</text>
  <text start="940.56" dur="6.6">it kind of ties the DC pedophile rings</text>
  <text start="943.8" dur="6.78">into these this pizza place in DC and I</text>
  <text start="947.16" dur="6.15">think it&amp;#39;s a bad name I refer to this</text>
  <text start="950.58" dur="4.59">whole thing as the pedophile rings there</text>
  <text start="953.31" dur="5.7">is rings there&amp;#39;s communities of people</text>
  <text start="955.17" dur="7.71">who are involved in pedophilia and I</text>
  <text start="959.01" dur="5.43">believe it is more prominent in DC than</text>
  <text start="962.88" dur="6.45">in other cities but it does exist in</text>
  <text start="964.44" dur="6.99">other cities and people have asked for a</text>
  <text start="969.33" dur="5.52">long time ever since the PISA gate</text>
  <text start="971.43" dur="5.1">scandal started up a year ago one of the</text>
  <text start="974.85" dur="4.02">pedophiles going down when are they</text>
  <text start="976.53" dur="9.12">going to get arrested why is nothing</text>
  <text start="978.87" dur="13.05">being done I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this</text>
  <text start="985.65" dur="8.37">and I know that people mean well and I</text>
  <text start="991.92" dur="5.96">know that they have their heart is in</text>
  <text start="994.02" dur="7.32">the right place and people are concerned</text>
  <text start="997.88" dur="6.31">because children are being abused and</text>
  <text start="1001.34" dur="5.97">mistreated and they&amp;#39;re dying and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1004.19" dur="6.78">being tortured every day and that is a</text>
  <text start="1007.31" dur="6.78">serious thing and so people who are have</text>
  <text start="1010.97" dur="4.86">a very soft heart are outraged and angry</text>
  <text start="1014.09" dur="4.97">that those children are still being</text>
  <text start="1015.83" dur="7.08">tortured and nothing is being done or</text>
  <text start="1019.06" dur="7.75">there is a perception that nothing is</text>
  <text start="1022.91" dur="5.67">being done it&amp;#39;s the perception that is</text>
  <text start="1026.81" dur="4.8">why people think that Jeff Sessions is</text>
  <text start="1028.58" dur="4.77">useless that is why they think rod Rosen</text>
  <text start="1031.61" dur="4.98">Stein is useless there&amp;#39;s the perception</text>
  <text start="1033.35" dur="5.34">that nothing is being done and I would</text>
  <text start="1036.59" dur="7.08">say this and this is what I the</text>
  <text start="1038.69" dur="10.02">conclusion I came to this afternoon ask</text>
  <text start="1043.67" dur="8.58">yourself why it is that pedophiles have</text>
  <text start="1048.71" dur="6.14">not been successfully prosecuted very</text>
  <text start="1052.25" dur="5.97">often in the past why do</text>
  <text start="1054.85" dur="6.34">big-time pedophiles continue to get away</text>
  <text start="1058.22" dur="5.78">with their crimes you have to ask</text>
  <text start="1061.19" dur="2.81">yourself that question</text>
  <text start="1065.2" dur="13.65">is it because they&amp;#39;re not being reported</text>
  <text start="1072.6" dur="10.63">probably not they are being reported but</text>
  <text start="1078.85" dur="8.309">they&amp;#39;re not being prosecuted right the</text>
  <text start="1083.23" dur="7.71">system of justice is corrupt there is</text>
  <text start="1087.159" dur="5.73">corruption in the judiciary there are</text>
  <text start="1090.94" dur="2.79">judges who are crooked who are being</text>
  <text start="1092.889" dur="3.39">blackmailed</text>
  <text start="1093.73" dur="4.59">there are prosecutors in the Department</text>
  <text start="1096.279" dur="2.76">of Justice who are corrupt and being</text>
  <text start="1098.32" dur="4.02">blackmailed</text>
  <text start="1099.039" dur="7.591">there are FBI agents who are being</text>
  <text start="1102.34" dur="7.23">blackmailed okay there is corruption in</text>
  <text start="1106.63" dur="6.62">the system that prosecutes them so if</text>
  <text start="1109.57" dur="6.87">you turn in a pedophile to the FBI and</text>
  <text start="1113.25" dur="4.57">the complaint goes to corrupt FBI agent</text>
  <text start="1116.44" dur="4.949">they&amp;#39;re not even going to be</text>
  <text start="1117.82" dur="7.469">investigated if they do get investigated</text>
  <text start="1121.389" dur="6">and they go before an attorney in the</text>
  <text start="1125.289" dur="5.161">DOJ who&amp;#39;s corrupt they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="1127.389" dur="6.211">get prosecuted and if they go before a</text>
  <text start="1130.45" dur="6.359">judge who is corrupt they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="1133.6" dur="6.689">to be found guilty and the problem with</text>
  <text start="1136.809" dur="7.58">prosecuting pedophiles is really we have</text>
  <text start="1140.289" dur="7.02">a corrupt system of judges attorneys</text>
  <text start="1144.389" dur="6.971">prosecutors and agents and the FBI and</text>
  <text start="1147.309" dur="6.811">police departments who are corrupt so</text>
  <text start="1151.36" dur="5.58">what good does it do to turn in</text>
  <text start="1154.12" dur="7.26">pedophiles to a corrupt system that</text>
  <text start="1156.94" dur="9.469">isn&amp;#39;t going to prosecute them the</text>
  <text start="1161.38" dur="8.519">solution is to remove the corrupt people</text>
  <text start="1166.409" dur="7.541">from the bench from the Department of</text>
  <text start="1169.899" dur="7.681">Justice and from the FBI you have to do</text>
  <text start="1173.95" dur="6.15">that first if you want these people to</text>
  <text start="1177.58" dur="5.76">be put in jail and you want to stop the</text>
  <text start="1180.1" dur="4.23">crimes that hat you have to fix the</text>
  <text start="1183.34" dur="3.15">system first</text>
  <text start="1184.33" dur="6.27">remember when Trump said it&amp;#39;s a rigged</text>
  <text start="1186.49" dur="6.51">system it really is a rigged system he</text>
  <text start="1190.6" dur="4.65">was talking not just about the the</text>
  <text start="1193" dur="5.88">system of election he was talking about</text>
  <text start="1195.25" dur="5.19">the whole system judges DOJ</text>
  <text start="1198.88" dur="4.14">be I the intelligence community is</text>
  <text start="1200.44" dur="5.61">corruption everywhere it&amp;#39;s rigged it is</text>
  <text start="1203.02" dur="4.68">rigged to let crooked people continue to</text>
  <text start="1206.05" dur="5.43">do the evil things that they want to do</text>
  <text start="1207.7" dur="6.92">and before that system is going to bring</text>
  <text start="1211.48" dur="8.25">justice to anyone it has to be fixed and</text>
  <text start="1214.62" dur="7.09">I think I think the reason why Andrew</text>

  <text start="1221.71" dur="6.69">Intelligence Committee today and the</text>
  <text start="1224.62" dur="5.19">reason why Bruce or skipped out of his</text>
  <text start="1228.4" dur="3.66">hearing yesterday and there</text>
  <text start="1229.81" dur="6.12">Congress is trying to bring these people</text>
  <text start="1232.06" dur="5.58">in from the DOJ and the FBI they need to</text>
  <text start="1235.93" dur="4.47">clean these people out and they know it</text>
  <text start="1237.64" dur="5.97">and they have to take these people out</text>
  <text start="1240.4" dur="5.31">of the system they have to remove the</text>
  <text start="1243.61" dur="5.1">corrupt prosecutors and investigators</text>
  <text start="1245.71" dur="5.43">and it&amp;#39;s a slow process and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1248.71" dur="4.38">difficult and it&amp;#39;s painstaking and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1251.14" dur="4.35">frustrating but they have to do that</text>
  <text start="1253.09" dur="4.8">first before they can take down the</text>
  <text start="1255.49" dur="4.41">pedophile rings now here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1257.89" dur="7.67">see going on here&amp;#39;s the big picture that</text>
  <text start="1259.9" dur="11.7">I see when Trump and then Rex Tillerson</text>
  <text start="1265.56" dur="13.23">went to Saudi Arabia they made very</text>
  <text start="1271.6" dur="7.19">clear what their policies were toward</text>
  <text start="1278.85" dur="6.1">what is acceptable in culture now they</text>
  <text start="1283.33" dur="3.54">said we&amp;#39;re not going to tell you how to</text>
  <text start="1284.95" dur="4.26">live your in your culture</text>
  <text start="1286.87" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re not exporting our Western culture</text>
  <text start="1289.21" dur="4.29">to you but here is what we&amp;#39;re doing and</text>
  <text start="1292.09" dur="3.45">if you want to work with us if you want</text>
  <text start="1293.5" dur="4.35">to partner with this here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1295.54" dur="4.56">doing you can partner with us Jared</text>
  <text start="1297.85" dur="4.77">Kushner goes to Saudi Arabia and shortly</text>
  <text start="1300.1" dur="5.76">thereafter a whole bunch of Saudi</text>
  <text start="1302.62" dur="9.75">princes are arrested and their money</text>
  <text start="1305.86" dur="10.92">their bank accounts are seized these</text>
  <text start="1312.37" dur="7.32">Saudi princes are billionaires and there</text>
  <text start="1316.78" dur="7.61">is a lot of evidence to suggest that the</text>
  <text start="1319.69" dur="8.94">Saudi princes were propping up a lot of</text>
  <text start="1324.39" dur="7">people in Washington they&amp;#39;re the puppet</text>
  <text start="1328.63" dur="4.11">masters Saudi princes are the puppet</text>
  <text start="1331.39" dur="5.399">masters they have the money</text>
  <text start="1332.74" dur="8.4">and they provide cover for corrupt</text>
  <text start="1336.789" dur="9.091">people in Washington the reason why</text>
  <text start="1341.14" dur="7.259">Trump went to Saudi first and dealt with</text>
  <text start="1345.88" dur="4.35">the Saudi government and got the King on</text>
  <text start="1348.399" dur="5.101">his side and got the Kings son on his</text>

  <text start="1356.77" dur="7.11">propping up our corrupt officials in</text>
  <text start="1360.01" dur="6.6">Washington is it any coincidence that as</text>
  <text start="1363.88" dur="5.73">soon as the Saudi princes were gone all</text>
  <text start="1366.61" dur="7.069">of the corruption the sex scandals and</text>

  <text start="1646.08" dur="5.19">thing to you and give you some</text>
  <text start="1647.01" dur="7.35">commentary on it because I think it is</text>
  <text start="1651.27" dur="5.73">probably the best big picture look at</text>
  <text start="1654.36" dur="3.99">what happened of anyone that I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="1657" dur="3.6">never had a lot of these threads and</text>
  <text start="1658.35" dur="6.66">I&amp;#39;ve read a lot of different ideas and I</text>
  <text start="1660.6" dur="7.34">would set this up we giving you some</text>
  <text start="1665.01" dur="7.35">background on general Flynn</text>
  <text start="1667.94" dur="6.16">general Flynn career military director</text>
  <text start="1672.36" dur="4.71">of he&amp;#39;s been in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1674.1" dur="8.73">community forever he&amp;#39;s 33 years in</text>
  <text start="1677.07" dur="8.4">intelligence the military was director</text>
  <text start="1682.83" dur="6.77">of military intelligence worked under</text>
  <text start="1685.47" dur="7.89">Obama that his thing with Obama was</text>
  <text start="1689.6" dur="5.62">Obama wanted to sanitize the military</text>
  <text start="1693.36" dur="6.48">and the Intelligence Committee take out</text>
  <text start="1695.22" dur="8.78">all references to Islamic militant and</text>
  <text start="1699.84" dur="6.57">jihad and he just wanted to sanitize it</text>
  <text start="1704" dur="5.83">Flynn does not like political</text>
  <text start="1706.41" dur="6.63">correctness Flynn hated that he thought</text>
  <text start="1709.83" dur="6.48">that taking out the verbage of you know</text>
  <text start="1713.04" dur="6.2">Islamic terrorists was making it</text>
  <text start="1716.31" dur="6.18">difficult and obfuscating their mission</text>
  <text start="1719.24" dur="7.24">so Flynn and Obama never got along on</text>
  <text start="1722.49" dur="6.27">that on those issues and Flynn pushed</text>
  <text start="1726.48" dur="5.64">back a lot against the policies that</text>
  <text start="1728.76" dur="4.23">Obama wanted so no surprise that Flynn</text>
  <text start="1732.12" dur="2.7">and ends</text>
  <text start="1732.99" dur="6.89">you know getting fired in is I end up on</text>
  <text start="1734.82" dur="9.03">the wrong side of Brennan and clapper so</text>
  <text start="1739.88" dur="7.45">around the time of the Republican</text>
  <text start="1743.85" dur="7.05">National Convention last year I think it</text>
  <text start="1747.33" dur="6.21">was July when it was clear that Trump</text>
  <text start="1750.9" dur="6.87">was going to be the nominee general</text>
  <text start="1753.54" dur="9.72">Flynn makes contact with President Trump</text>
  <text start="1757.77" dur="8.73">with candidate Trump now when I saw</text>
  <text start="1763.26" dur="5.73">Flynn at the convention and he gave a</text>
  <text start="1766.5" dur="4.559">speech and he was obviously allied with</text>
  <text start="1768.99" dur="5.58">Trump I thought this is really weird</text>
  <text start="1771.059" dur="5.491">that one of Obama&amp;#39;s generals would come</text>
  <text start="1774.57" dur="5.82">and support Trump at a rally I just</text>
  <text start="1776.55" dur="8.4">thought it was weird right but and Flynn</text>
  <text start="1780.39" dur="6.03">being a Democrat and Flynn being really</text>
  <text start="1784.95" dur="4.109">well-respected in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1786.42" dur="4.59">community I just thought it was odd that</text>
  <text start="1789.059" dur="7.051">Trump would have someone a heavy hitter</text>
  <text start="1791.01" dur="7.68">like Flynn come to his the the the</text>
  <text start="1796.11" dur="7.44">convention and speak I just thought it</text>
  <text start="1798.69" dur="7.19">was odd but here&amp;#39;s here is something to</text>
  <text start="1803.55" dur="2.33">think about</text>
  <text start="1807.14" dur="10.81">Flynn must have seen something in trunk</text>
  <text start="1814.65" dur="5.13">that he liked and that he thought I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1817.95" dur="4.08">going to throw in with this guy because</text>
  <text start="1819.78" dur="4.649">I think this guy can fix the problems</text>
  <text start="1822.03" dur="3.93">that I&amp;#39;ve seen if if anyone in the</text>
  <text start="1824.429" dur="5.431">intelligence community knows the</text>
  <text start="1825.96" dur="6.99">problems that exist its Flynn Flynn and</text>
  <text start="1829.86" dur="4.89">Abra Rodgers those two guys they know</text>
  <text start="1832.95" dur="3.59">better than anyone the problems that</text>
  <text start="1834.75" dur="6.24">exist in the intelligence community and</text>
  <text start="1836.54" dur="7.54">so Flynn would have had great knowledge</text>
  <text start="1840.99" dur="5.34">of all of the problems that were going</text>
  <text start="1844.08" dur="6.03">on under the Obama administration and</text>
  <text start="1846.33" dur="9.3">under Bush right Flynn had all the</text>
  <text start="1850.11" dur="10.26">information like Rogers right so Flynn</text>
  <text start="1855.63" dur="7.35">and Trump start talking and I think</text>
  <text start="1860.37" dur="4.65">Flynn had to come to Jesus meeting with</text>
  <text start="1862.98" dur="3.23">Trump basically can&amp;#39;t pull them aside</text>
  <text start="1865.02" dur="3.29">and said look</text>
  <text start="1866.21" dur="4.05">there are some massive problems there</text>
  <text start="1868.31" dur="3.84">huge problems that you don&amp;#39;t know about</text>
  <text start="1870.26" dur="6.03">maybe you know about them maybe you</text>
  <text start="1872.15" dur="6.81">don&amp;#39;t I can help you navigate the</text>
  <text start="1876.29" dur="5.58">minefield you are walking into these</text>
  <text start="1878.96" dur="5.55">people in this administration are out to</text>
  <text start="1881.87" dur="4.74">sabotage you they are out to trap you</text>
  <text start="1884.51" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;re out to trick you they&amp;#39;re out to</text>
  <text start="1886.61" dur="3.21">make sure you don&amp;#39;t get elected and</text>
  <text start="1887.9" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re out to make sure that if you do</text>
  <text start="1889.82" dur="5.79">get elected or getting a peach flynn I</text>
  <text start="1891.98" dur="9.09">think being the master spy that he was</text>
  <text start="1895.61" dur="8.04">he knew what exactly what Brennan and</text>
  <text start="1901.07" dur="4.2">clapper and Susan Rice and all the</text>
  <text start="1903.65" dur="4.1">people on Obama&amp;#39;s National Security</text>
  <text start="1905.27" dur="6.32">Council Flynn knew what they were doing</text>
  <text start="1907.75" dur="8.83">there&amp;#39;s no way he didn&amp;#39;t know it and</text>
  <text start="1911.59" dur="7.48">pair Flynn with Mike Rogers NSA those</text>
  <text start="1916.58" dur="5.85">two guys what fling didn&amp;#39;t know Mike</text>
  <text start="1919.07" dur="8.51">Rogers did and I think they got to trump</text>
  <text start="1922.43" dur="10.43">early and started him on a path that</text>
  <text start="1927.58" dur="8.98">none of us suspected you can only see it</text>
  <text start="1932.86" dur="5.85">looking back in hindsight and go maybe</text>
  <text start="1936.56" dur="6.51">this is what they were doing all along</text>
  <text start="1938.71" dur="8.05">so with that backdrop I&amp;#39;m going to read</text>
  <text start="1943.07" dur="10.5">to you this thread by draw and strike</text>
  <text start="1946.76" dur="9.9">stealth Jeff early on there was good</text>
  <text start="1953.57" dur="5.34">evidence for a theory that Trump during</text>
  <text start="1956.66" dur="5.36">the campaign was being advised by very</text>
  <text start="1958.91" dur="5.94">solid group of military Intel people</text>
  <text start="1962.02" dur="4.35">highly trained in the art of military</text>
  <text start="1964.85" dur="4.83">deception</text>
  <text start="1966.37" dur="9.91">okay military deception plays heavily</text>
  <text start="1969.68" dur="8.64">into this theory people who have</text>
  <text start="1976.28" dur="5.4">observed Trump have always have kind of</text>
  <text start="1978.32" dur="5.55">said Trump had really good intelligence</text>
  <text start="1981.68" dur="3.39">coming into the election and then after</text>
  <text start="1983.87" dur="7.05">he got nominated he had even better</text>
  <text start="1985.07" dur="8.19">intelligence so you it&amp;#39;s common for</text>
  <text start="1990.92" dur="5.13">people to think that Trump was coming</text>
  <text start="1993.26" dur="6.6">into the election blind and did not know</text>
  <text start="1996.05" dur="6.629">what was going on the other theory is</text>
  <text start="1999.86" dur="6.09">was one of the most well advised people</text>
  <text start="2002.679" dur="6.061">who ever got elected and he had a lot of</text>
  <text start="2005.95" dur="5.01">patriotic military intelligence people</text>
  <text start="2008.74" dur="4.25">around him who were helping guide him</text>
  <text start="2010.96" dur="5.73">through the minefield</text>
  <text start="2012.99" dur="4.439">those are your two theories hey what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2016.69" dur="4.92">going on</text>
  <text start="2017.429" dur="6.401">so the ground worked for a very</text>
  <text start="2021.61" dur="6.049">sophisticated military deception style</text>
  <text start="2023.83" dur="6.92">operation was set in motion while Trump</text>
  <text start="2027.659" dur="6.791">campaign was in its early stages</text>
  <text start="2030.75" dur="8.71">Trump&amp;#39;s military advisors knew that</text>
  <text start="2034.45" dur="8.31">Obama the DNC and Hillary and her Nexus</text>
  <text start="2039.46" dur="5.88">was using and abusing law enforcement</text>
  <text start="2042.76" dur="4.5">and intelligence apparatus in the</text>
  <text start="2045.34" dur="6.029">federal government to legally and</text>
  <text start="2047.26" dur="7.71">illegally spy on them so his theory is</text>
  <text start="2051.369" dur="5.641">these military advisors they knew that</text>
  <text start="2054.97" dur="7.02">the Obama administration was spying on</text>
  <text start="2057.01" dur="6.599">them according to Sun Tzu&amp;#39;s Art of War</text>
  <text start="2061.99" dur="4.02">the first principle of winning any</text>
  <text start="2063.609" dur="6.451">battle is knowing the enemy and knowing</text>
  <text start="2066.01" dur="6.06">yourself battles and wars are lost due</text>
  <text start="2070.06" dur="3.69">to not accurately seeing or</text>
  <text start="2072.07" dur="5.069">understanding either your enemy or your</text>
  <text start="2073.75" dur="5.31">own forces and Trump studied sons ooh</text>
  <text start="2077.139" dur="3.901">his book the art of the deal was based</text>
  <text start="2079.06" dur="7.02">on the principles of the art of war by</text>
  <text start="2081.04" dur="8.91">Sun zu okay if you know your enemy how</text>
  <text start="2086.08" dur="6.48">he operates his methods his strategies</text>
  <text start="2089.95" dur="5.729">for pursuing his goals you can formulate</text>
  <text start="2092.56" dur="5.46">a plan for his defeat that will work so</text>
  <text start="2095.679" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s all about knowing your enemy and</text>
  <text start="2098.02" dur="5.339">how does Trump get the upper hand on so</text>
  <text start="2100.839" dur="5.01">many people because he studies his enemy</text>
  <text start="2103.359" dur="3.661">knows her tactics knows her strategies</text>
  <text start="2105.849" dur="4.201">knows what they&amp;#39;re trying to accomplish</text>
  <text start="2107.02" dur="4.319">and dangles shiny things over here for</text>
  <text start="2110.05" dur="4.83">them while he&amp;#39;s over here doing</text>
  <text start="2111.339" dur="8.971">something else Trump is a master of</text>
  <text start="2114.88" dur="8.55">doing that his military advisors</text>
  <text start="2120.31" dur="5.52">carefully assess the enemy in the</text>
  <text start="2123.43" dur="5.189">forthcoming war that was already</text>
  <text start="2125.83" dur="5.43">underway and would intensify if he</text>
  <text start="2128.619" dur="4.481">actually won the election when you know</text>
  <text start="2131.26" dur="5.05">how the enemy will attack you</text>
  <text start="2133.1" dur="9.09">set traps for them and guide them into</text>
  <text start="2136.31" dur="10.32">the traps not long before he declared</text>
  <text start="2142.19" dur="6.87">his candidacy advisors in the know sat</text>
  <text start="2146.63" dur="5.61">Trump down and filled him in about how</text>
  <text start="2149.06" dur="5.34">just how badly Obama and holder had</text>
  <text start="2152.24" dur="5.25">corrupted the law enforcement and</text>

  <text start="2157.49" dur="4.95">deal and then protect and preserve it</text>
  <text start="2160.25" dur="4.8">Obama and company used the intelligence</text>
  <text start="2162.44" dur="5.49">community to spy on the Iran deals</text>
  <text start="2165.05" dur="4.74">critics and then use government info</text>

  <text start="2176.21" dur="6.68">following him early on when he was doing</text>
  <text start="2178.67" dur="7.41">the Eric Braverman series is that Obama</text>
  <text start="2182.89" dur="7.21">took the JTTF the Joint Terrorism Task</text>
  <text start="2186.08" dur="7.74">Force legislation and put that thing on</text>
  <text start="2190.1" dur="8.19">steroids the JTTF Joint Terrorism on</text>
  <text start="2193.82" dur="7.97">task force gave Obama a sense that he</text>
  <text start="2198.29" dur="6.39">could surveil and spy on anyone and</text>
  <text start="2201.79" dur="4.78">George Webb says that Obama was spying</text>
  <text start="2204.68" dur="5.07">on air he had FBI agents watching</text>
  <text start="2206.57" dur="5.72">everybody scooping up information on</text>
  <text start="2209.75" dur="6.96">everyone Obama was very paranoid and</text>
  <text start="2212.29" dur="6.43">gathered dirt on everybody friends and</text>
  <text start="2216.71" dur="3.6">enemies alike he didn&amp;#39;t care he wanted</text>
  <text start="2218.72" dur="4.89">to have dirt on everybody that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="2220.31" dur="6.63">got Petraeus when Petraeus started to</text>
  <text start="2223.61" dur="5.52">have some loyalty issues Obama had dirt</text>
  <text start="2226.94" dur="3.78">on him knew that he had given some</text>
  <text start="2229.13" dur="4.92">classified Intel to his girlfriend and</text>
  <text start="2230.72" dur="5.85">got him got him out so I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="2234.05" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s any doubt not in my mind that</text>
  <text start="2236.57" dur="4.59">Obama was spying on everybody he was</text>
  <text start="2239.45" dur="4.86">using the intelligence apparatus to spy</text>
  <text start="2241.16" dur="4.71">on everyone and the spies knew that they</text>
  <text start="2244.31" dur="3.96">knew dang well that there was everyone</text>
  <text start="2245.87" dur="3.69">was being surveilled they all knew their</text>
  <text start="2248.27" dur="2.52">phones are being listened to their</text>
  <text start="2249.56" dur="2">emails are being they all knew they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2250.79" dur="7.08">being spied on</text>
  <text start="2251.56" dur="10.96">alright so Trump&amp;#39;s of advisers observed</text>
  <text start="2257.87" dur="6.99">this method in action up close there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2262.52" dur="4.56">little doubt during the campaign that</text>
  <text start="2264.86" dur="3.96">Obama Hillary and the deans</text>
  <text start="2267.08" dur="4.05">now firmly entrenched in law enforcement</text>
  <text start="2268.82" dur="3.48">elements agencies were going to turn</text>
  <text start="2271.13" dur="3.56">their intelligence gathering</text>
  <text start="2272.3" dur="6.44">capabilities onto the Trump campaign</text>
  <text start="2274.69" dur="6.07">they expected it and they planned for it</text>
  <text start="2278.74" dur="5.29">because if you know that they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2280.76" dur="5.31">it you have to come up with a plan how</text>
  <text start="2284.03" dur="3.57">are we going to defeat these people we</text>
  <text start="2286.07" dur="5.04">know they&amp;#39;re spying on all of us</text>
  <text start="2287.6" dur="6.66">how do we turn the tables and defeat</text>
  <text start="2291.11" dur="5.64">them do we just walk haplessly into this</text>
  <text start="2294.26" dur="3.48">situation and let them spy on us and not</text>
  <text start="2296.75" dur="4.56">do anything about it</text>
  <text start="2297.74" dur="4.74">they knew they were being spied on they</text>
  <text start="2301.31" dur="2.16">were done with the dumbest people in the</text>
  <text start="2302.48" dur="3.15">world if they didn&amp;#39;t know that and</text>
  <text start="2303.47" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;re not that dumb so they had to</text>
  <text start="2305.63" dur="6.24">know they&amp;#39;re being spied on so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2309.08" dur="5.7">gonna come up after us using the</text>
  <text start="2311.87" dur="5.67">intelligence apparatus of the FBI the</text>
  <text start="2314.78" dur="3.93">NSA and the FISA courts because they all</text>
  <text start="2317.54" dur="2.81">know how this works</text>
  <text start="2318.71" dur="4.47">FISA courts have been weaponized</text>
  <text start="2320.35" dur="8.14">actually for a long time there have been</text>
  <text start="2323.18" dur="7.35">the the Inspector General has looking</text>
  <text start="2328.49" dur="4.68">been looking at the FISA Court abuses</text>
  <text start="2330.53" dur="3.93">for years and there were reason why</text>
  <text start="2333.17" dur="4.05">there&amp;#39;s so much controversy about</text>
  <text start="2334.46" dur="4.74">renewal of the 702 that authorizes</text>
  <text start="2337.22" dur="4.02">surveillance through the FISA Court is</text>
  <text start="2339.2" dur="5.22">because there has been so much abuse of</text>
  <text start="2341.24" dur="4.8">it in the last few years the judiciary</text>
  <text start="2344.42" dur="4.89">and intelligence committees are thinking</text>
  <text start="2346.04" dur="8.61">about actually not renewing the 702 it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2349.31" dur="9.96">been abused so much so the theory is</text>
  <text start="2354.65" dur="7.38">with Flynn and Trump they know they</text>
  <text start="2359.27" dur="6.24">anticipate that Obama and his people are</text>
  <text start="2362.03" dur="5.63">going to abuse and use the spy tools to</text>
  <text start="2365.51" dur="7.67">surveil them and they know that&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="2367.66" dur="8.83">so their plan is hey let&amp;#39;s help them</text>
  <text start="2373.18" dur="5.74">let&amp;#39;s give them targets that they are</text>
  <text start="2376.49" dur="5.39">looking for and we&amp;#39;ll set traps for them</text>
  <text start="2378.92" dur="5.91">and we&amp;#39;ll guide them into the traps</text>
  <text start="2381.88" dur="5.86">having formed a plan trumping his team</text>
  <text start="2384.83" dur="4.64">then begin implementing it first</text>
  <text start="2387.74" dur="6.78">remember that all these political motive</text>
  <text start="2389.47" dur="7.81">motivated fixers in Obama of the DNC and</text>
  <text start="2394.52" dur="5.73">Hillary&amp;#39;s camp these federal agencies</text>
  <text start="2397.28" dur="3.64">had just spent eight years covering up</text>
  <text start="2400.25" dur="5.38">four</text>
  <text start="2400.92" dur="7.08">Obama Hillary and holder and they did a</text>
  <text start="2405.63" dur="3.96">lot of dirty stuff I mean you&amp;#39;ve only</text>
  <text start="2408" dur="4.74">heard about a few of the scandals fast</text>
  <text start="2409.59" dur="5.67">and furious and the Iran deal and all</text>
  <text start="2412.74" dur="5.22">the criminals that they let go that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2415.26" dur="9.03">just the the surface it&amp;#39;s the tip of the</text>
  <text start="2417.96" dur="9.75">iceberg there&amp;#39;s a lot more so these</text>
  <text start="2424.29" dur="6.06">people in the DOJ and the FBI had spent</text>
  <text start="2427.71" dur="5.79">eight years making sure the top brass</text>
  <text start="2430.35" dur="6.36">none of them got caught they became</text>
  <text start="2433.5" dur="4.44">really good at covering or they they</text>
  <text start="2436.71" dur="2.97">didn&amp;#39;t become really good at covering</text>
  <text start="2437.94" dur="4.47">because as long as Comey</text>
  <text start="2439.68" dur="4.47">was in charge at the FBI and Loretta</text>
  <text start="2442.41" dur="4.17">Lynch or Holder was in at the DOJ</text>
  <text start="2444.15" dur="5.55">no one was ever gonna get prosecuted but</text>
  <text start="2446.58" dur="7.65">they still had to fix some things and</text>
  <text start="2449.7" dur="6.3">cover their tracks while these people</text>
  <text start="2454.23" dur="4.98">were making sure their top political</text>
  <text start="2456" dur="6.03">heroes were skating they turned around</text>
  <text start="2459.21" dur="4.29">and nailed every Republican political</text>
  <text start="2462.03" dur="4.62">opponent they could this is the</text>
  <text start="2463.5" dur="7.67">weaponization of the DOJ the IRS and the</text>
  <text start="2466.65" dur="4.52">FBI against Obama&amp;#39;s political opponents</text>
  <text start="2471.44" dur="7.84">that&amp;#39;s what happened with Petraeus and</text>
  <text start="2473.61" dur="9.42">other people so Trump&amp;#39;s advisers who are</text>
  <text start="2479.28" dur="6.03">very smart people they&amp;#39;ve been watching</text>
  <text start="2483.03" dur="4.59">this go on for eight years and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2485.31" dur="4.44">watching and they&amp;#39;re developing the</text>
  <text start="2487.62" dur="4.44">modus operandi they&amp;#39;re watching and</text>
  <text start="2489.75" dur="3.66">observing how these people work and they</text>
  <text start="2492.06" dur="2.87">know their schemes they know their</text>
  <text start="2493.41" dur="5.45">strategies and they know their tactics</text>
  <text start="2494.93" dur="6.73">so they devised a plan to stop it</text>
  <text start="2498.86" dur="5.83">they&amp;#39;re gonna set traps and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2501.66" dur="6.6">gonna have these people who are corrupt</text>
  <text start="2504.69" dur="5.79">walk right into the traps though one of</text>
  <text start="2508.26" dur="6.9">the things that he brings in here is the</text>
  <text start="2510.48" dur="7.17">fact that as as crooked as Obama and</text>
  <text start="2515.16" dur="4.56">Hillary and Holder were the people in</text>
  <text start="2517.65" dur="4.98">the DOJ and the FBI actually kind of</text>
  <text start="2519.72" dur="5.64">liked them and they thought Trump was</text>
  <text start="2522.63" dur="5.43">more corrupt than Hillary Obama or</text>
  <text start="2525.36" dur="4.74">Holder they hated Trump they feared him</text>
  <text start="2528.06" dur="6.27">and they thought he was corrupt so they</text>
  <text start="2530.1" dur="6.39">had a motive to want to trap him</text>
  <text start="2534.33" dur="4.53">to go after him and take him down which</text>
  <text start="2536.49" dur="4.92">is evidenced in the text messages</text>
  <text start="2538.86" dur="4.14">between Strock and lisa page you can see</text>
  <text start="2541.41" dur="3.81">how much loathing and hatred they had</text>
  <text start="2543" dur="4.29">for them like Alina that&amp;#39;s just how</text>
  <text start="2545.22" dur="3.48">liberals are liberals have been told by</text>
  <text start="2547.29" dur="4.14">the media they don&amp;#39;t even know why</text>
  <text start="2548.7" dur="5.51">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the crazy thing three</text>
  <text start="2551.43" dur="6.59">years ago before Trump ran for office</text>
  <text start="2554.21" dur="8.92">nobody hated him nobody hated Trump</text>
  <text start="2558.02" dur="7.81">until the mainstream media developed</text>
  <text start="2563.13" dur="5.64">this narrative that he was a person to</text>
  <text start="2565.83" dur="5.16">be despised and hated and all of these</text>
  <text start="2568.77" dur="3.69">people fell right in line and just</text>
  <text start="2570.99" dur="3.87">started buying all the stories about</text>
  <text start="2572.46" dur="4.74">what an evil wicked horrible Nazi he was</text>
  <text start="2574.86" dur="5.67">but nobody thought that about Trump and</text>
  <text start="2577.2" dur="7.17">three years ago no one it is so bizarre</text>
  <text start="2580.53" dur="5.55">to see how a large number of people can</text>
  <text start="2584.37" dur="5.24">be brainwashed into thinking all that</text>
  <text start="2586.08" dur="7.92">just through mainstream media narrative</text>
  <text start="2589.61" dur="5.95">to me it&amp;#39;s amazing and these people in</text>
  <text start="2594" dur="2.24">the DOJ and FBI they kind of bought into</text>
  <text start="2595.56" dur="3.24">it too</text>
  <text start="2596.24" dur="5.32">they had just all thought Trump was some</text>
  <text start="2598.8" dur="7.79">evil sadistic Hitler person who needed</text>
  <text start="2601.56" dur="5.03">to be gone and and here&amp;#39;s another thing</text>
  <text start="2607.28" dur="7.3">they know how politics works they have</text>
  <text start="2611.97" dur="4.35">seen many presidents come and go they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2614.58" dur="5.07">seen Congress people come and go and</text>
  <text start="2616.32" dur="6.69">senators they know how politicians work</text>
  <text start="2619.65" dur="5.22">if you the assumption is if you go into</text>
  <text start="2623.01" dur="5.19">politics especially if you aspire to be</text>
  <text start="2624.87" dur="6.66">president you are in it to get some</text>
  <text start="2628.2" dur="7.05">money to get power and influence so you</text>
  <text start="2631.53" dur="7.01">can make some deals right and Trump&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2635.25" dur="7.74">dealer Trump is a deal maker right so</text>
  <text start="2638.54" dur="6.88">Hillary set up the Clinton Foundation to</text>
  <text start="2642.99" dur="4.62">funnel money through a nonprofit</text>
  <text start="2645.42" dur="4.23">organization where people would make</text>
  <text start="2647.61" dur="3.75">donations to the Clinton Foundation and</text>
  <text start="2649.65" dur="3.99">they would get political favors out of</text>
  <text start="2651.36" dur="4.97">that pay-for-play that is how the</text>
  <text start="2653.64" dur="10.23">Clintons have always run their operation</text>
  <text start="2656.33" dur="10.09">if you are Hillary you assume every</text>
  <text start="2663.87" dur="4.14">other politician is running the same</text>
  <text start="2666.42" dur="5.86">game</text>
  <text start="2668.01" dur="7">this is important if you&amp;#39;re Hillary you</text>
  <text start="2672.28" dur="5.19">assume Trump is trying to get into the</text>
  <text start="2675.01" dur="4.86">White House because he is going to set</text>
  <text start="2677.47" dur="4.8">up his pay-for-play just like me just</text>
  <text start="2679.87" dur="3.78">like Obama is going out doing hat you</text>
  <text start="2682.27" dur="3.63">know half a million dollar speeches now</text>
  <text start="2683.65" dur="4.26">it&amp;#39;s all about I have power I have</text>
  <text start="2685.9" dur="3.87">influence you give me a half a million</text>
  <text start="2687.91" dur="4.77">dollars and I&amp;#39;ll make sure that whatever</text>
  <text start="2689.77" dur="4.34">you want is gonna happen you sell your</text>
  <text start="2692.68" dur="2.57">influence to the highest bidder</text>
  <text start="2694.11" dur="5.47">pay-for-play</text>
  <text start="2695.25" dur="7.48">Hillary and Obama assumed Trump was into</text>
  <text start="2699.58" dur="7.26">pay-for-play he had to be why else would</text>
  <text start="2702.73" dur="7.98">you want to be president they</text>
  <text start="2706.84" dur="7.02">miscalculated because Trump was not into</text>
  <text start="2710.71" dur="4.98">pay-for-play that&amp;#39;s where they made</text>
  <text start="2713.86" dur="9.81">their critical mistake they assumed</text>
  <text start="2715.69" dur="10.35">Trump was just like them so they would</text>
  <text start="2723.67" dur="4.32">assume Trump had to be working with</text>
  <text start="2726.04" dur="4.47">another government had to be taking</text>
  <text start="2727.99" dur="4.32">bribes had to be you know working some</text>
  <text start="2730.51" dur="3.93">angle with someone to get political</text>
  <text start="2732.31" dur="6.21">favor once he got into the White House</text>
  <text start="2734.44" dur="13.98">that&amp;#39;s their assumption so who is it we</text>
  <text start="2738.52" dur="14.46">just have to find out who it is so Trump</text>
  <text start="2748.42" dur="6.48">and his intelligence friends are this is</text>
  <text start="2752.98" dur="4.59">the angle they&amp;#39;re working Hillary and</text>
  <text start="2754.9" dur="4.71">Obama are going to assume you are into</text>
  <text start="2757.57" dur="5.45">some corrupt pay-for-play thing and</text>
  <text start="2759.61" dur="6.3">we&amp;#39;re going to let them think you are</text>
  <text start="2763.02" dur="5.77">even though you&amp;#39;re not we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2765.91" dur="4.71">let them think you&amp;#39;re in colluding or</text>
  <text start="2768.79" dur="5.16">doing some pay-for-play with somebody</text>
  <text start="2770.62" dur="5.01">and we&amp;#39;ll create a narrative and they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2773.95" dur="7.2">will throw it out there as bait then</text>
  <text start="2775.63" dur="8.67">they&amp;#39;ll go for it all right in the art</text>
  <text start="2781.15" dur="5.46">of war you draw your enemy in by giving</text>
  <text start="2784.3" dur="5.46">them the appearance of what they hope or</text>
  <text start="2786.61" dur="5.19">expect to see you dangle the bait in</text>
  <text start="2789.76" dur="5.64">front of them they come in closer and</text>
  <text start="2791.8" dur="5.28">then you can clobber them and that is</text>
  <text start="2795.4" dur="3.81">exactly what Trump and his advisers did</text>
  <text start="2797.08" dur="3.87">so here&amp;#39;s the plan they came up with</text>
  <text start="2799.21" dur="4.8">Trump began in</text>
  <text start="2800.95" dur="5.73">bragging on the campaign trail about all</text>
  <text start="2804.01" dur="5.9">the sweet amazing deals he was gonna do</text>
  <text start="2806.68" dur="6.51">with Putin once he won the election</text>
  <text start="2809.91" dur="6.25">Trump talked so much about Russia and</text>
  <text start="2813.19" dur="5.91">Putin during the campaign it became a</text>
  <text start="2816.16" dur="4.71">meme it became this running joke that</text>
  <text start="2819.1" dur="3.75">Trump was like oh wouldn&amp;#39;t it be great</text>
  <text start="2820.87" dur="3.42">if we got along with Russia and why</text>
  <text start="2822.85" dur="2.73">can&amp;#39;t we just get along with Russia and</text>
  <text start="2824.29" dur="3.12">we should do this and everything should</text>
  <text start="2825.58" dur="3.51">be peaceful and you know we should have</text>
  <text start="2827.41" dur="5.01">all these things with Russia why we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2829.09" dur="4.68">not in the Cold War anymore hey 1985</text>
  <text start="2832.42" dur="6.27">called they want their foreign policy</text>
  <text start="2833.77" dur="8.85">back so Trump was trolling Hillary and</text>
  <text start="2838.69" dur="8.88">Obama by talking Russia Russia Russia</text>
  <text start="2842.62" dur="9.15">during the campaign what did that tell</text>
  <text start="2847.57" dur="6.84">Hillary and Obama oh we know who his</text>

  <text start="3183.92" dur="6.7">this is when Trump tweets out did Obama</text>
  <text start="3187.23" dur="5.82">actually tap my my wires in Trump Tower</text>
  <text start="3190.62" dur="3.9">see there was this big controversy when</text>
  <text start="3193.05" dur="3.78">Trump tweeted out about knowing that he</text>
  <text start="3194.52" dur="4.59">was being surveilled but of course he</text>
  <text start="3196.83" dur="3.57">was and he tweeted it out he never</text>

  <text start="3201.93" dur="5.82">he knew what they were doing alright</text>
  <text start="3204.599" dur="6">Trump so far Trump and his military</text>
  <text start="3207.75" dur="7.2">advisers can see that their plan is</text>

  <text start="3221.16" dur="6.179">that there&amp;#39;s Russian collusion and they</text>
  <text start="3224.13" dur="6.36">got the opposition team to break the law</text>
  <text start="3227.339" dur="5.22">they falsely misrepresented they</text>
  <text start="3230.49" dur="4.589">misrepresented what was in that steel</text>

  <text start="3235.079" dur="5.551">to get permission to surveil and then</text>
  <text start="3238.02" dur="5.069">they illegally unmasked the people in</text>
  <text start="3240.63" dur="4.199">Trump&amp;#39;s team so they broke the law at a</text>

  <text start="3244.829" dur="5.461">they&amp;#39;re all they can all be prosecuted</text>
  <text start="3249.05" dur="4.059">yeah</text>
  <text start="3250.29" dur="5.13">Trump&amp;#39;s team realizes that the the guy</text>
  <text start="3253.109" dur="8.071">the political fixers are going to target</text>
  <text start="3255.42" dur="8.28">next is Mike Flynn during that so the</text>
  <text start="3261.18" dur="4.05">steel dossier was a suggestion that</text>
  <text start="3263.7" dur="3.899">there was some collusion going on with</text>
  <text start="3265.23" dur="4.859">Russia but they need better evidence so</text>
  <text start="3267.599" dur="5.401">they&amp;#39;re going to set up Mike Flynn to</text>
  <text start="3270.089" dur="5.01">have meetings with Russians they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3273" dur="3.299">gonna make sure they know that Jeff</text>

  <text start="3278.04" dur="3.93">Jared Kushner and Trump jr. have</text>
  <text start="3279.78" dur="4.319">meetings with Russians they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3281.97" dur="5.879">orchestrate all these Russian meetings</text>
  <text start="3284.099" dur="6.691">with Russians to make sure that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3287.849" dur="5.311">that they have some at least appearance</text>
  <text start="3290.79" dur="6.45">that there&amp;#39;s meetings with Russians that</text>
  <text start="3293.16" dur="5.73">they can talk about and and illustrate</text>
  <text start="3297.24" dur="3.42">that there&amp;#39;s some collusion going on</text>
  <text start="3298.89" dur="3.54">because if there wasn&amp;#39;t any actual</text>
  <text start="3300.66" dur="4.399">collision they have to manufacture</text>
  <text start="3302.43" dur="5.34">something that looks like collision</text>
  <text start="3305.059" dur="4.24">during the course of the transition this</text>
  <text start="3307.77" dur="7.73">was actually just like a week or two</text>
  <text start="3309.299" dur="9.691">before Obama left office Obama levies</text>
  <text start="3315.5" dur="7.54">sanctions on Russia and boots out a</text>
  <text start="3318.99" dur="8.339">bunch of Russian diplomats Flynn who had</text>
  <text start="3323.04" dur="7.319">been fired by Obama was tasked with</text>
  <text start="3327.329" dur="5.641">reaching out to the Russians so Obama</text>
  <text start="3330.359" dur="5.131">before he leaves office creates a little</text>
  <text start="3332.97" dur="5.16">a little heart</text>
  <text start="3335.49" dur="6.69">a little Russian problem that Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3338.13" dur="6.36">team has to fix someone on Trump&amp;#39;s team</text>
  <text start="3342.18" dur="5.61">has to make a call to a Russian</text>
  <text start="3344.49" dur="4.89">ambassador and it&amp;#39;s because Obama kicked</text>
  <text start="3347.79" dur="3.63">out a bunch of Russian diplomats and put</text>
  <text start="3349.38" dur="4.56">up the sanctions so he&amp;#39;s baiting</text>
  <text start="3351.42" dur="5.61">somebody on Trump&amp;#39;s team to talk to</text>
  <text start="3353.94" dur="5.97">Russia this is part of the plan now</text>
  <text start="3357.03" dur="4.5">Flynn is a smart guy Flynn makes a call</text>
  <text start="3359.91" dur="3.21">on an unsecured line and he knows he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3361.53" dur="3.09">being monitored he knows he&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="3363.12" dur="3.93">surveilled he knows that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3364.62" dur="4.02">recording the conversation all right so</text>
  <text start="3367.05" dur="4.23">you think phone&amp;#39;s gonna do anything dumb</text>
  <text start="3368.64" dur="6">on that phone call no he&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="3371.28" dur="7.11">as National Security Advisor</text>
  <text start="3374.64" dur="5.55">it was Flynn&amp;#39;s job to talk to people</text>
  <text start="3378.39" dur="2.64">ambassadors from other countries so he</text>
  <text start="3380.19" dur="3.99">didn&amp;#39;t do anything illegal</text>
  <text start="3381.03" dur="6.72">and of course Flynn also knows that his</text>

  <text start="3392.97" dur="8.99">story breaks in the media that Flynn has</text>
  <text start="3398.64" dur="6.47">been caught doing a very naughty thing</text>
  <text start="3401.96" dur="6.54">the narrative that is launched with</text>
  <text start="3405.11" dur="6.66">brilliant coordination by the media is</text>
  <text start="3408.5" dur="6.46">Trump and Flynn tried to set up a secret</text>
  <text start="3411.77" dur="7.39">pay-for-play deal with the Russians to</text>
  <text start="3414.96" dur="7.14">get the sanctions lifted so the innuendo</text>
  <text start="3419.16" dur="5.49">here is Flynn talk to kiss lyac there</text>
  <text start="3422.1" dur="3.87">was some bribery some pay-for-play some</text>
  <text start="3424.65" dur="3.3">we&amp;#39;re gonna do this you do that we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3425.97" dur="4.41">get rid of the sanctions if you do this</text>
  <text start="3427.95" dur="4.77">for us they were working the the the</text>
  <text start="3430.38" dur="8.01">pay-for-play deal that&amp;#39;s what the setup</text>
  <text start="3432.72" dur="8.42">was or even better Flynn is can be</text>
  <text start="3438.39" dur="6.84">charged with violating the Logan Act</text>
  <text start="3441.14" dur="7.51">although I have read reports that Flynn</text>
  <text start="3445.23" dur="5.79">actually called Susan Rice and made the</text>
  <text start="3448.65" dur="5.28">Obama administration approve his phone</text>
  <text start="3451.02" dur="6">call to kiss lyac so Flynn did not</text>

  <text start="3461.13" dur="3.53">just as some cite issue</text>
  <text start="3465.66" dur="8.73">but this reveals to Trump in his team</text>
  <text start="3471.02" dur="5.44">what is actually going on what their</text>
  <text start="3474.39" dur="4.88">plan is they&amp;#39;re still working on the the</text>
  <text start="3476.46" dur="5.879">anger the Russian angle on pay for play</text>
  <text start="3479.27" dur="6.25">so Trump and his team had a response</text>
  <text start="3482.339" dur="5.161">waiting for this they know exactly what</text>
  <text start="3485.52" dur="4.319">they need to do and they can move to</text>
  <text start="3487.5" dur="5.94">their next phase of their military</text>

  <text start="3493.44" dur="5.149">from that point on has three points to</text>
  <text start="3495.63" dur="5.61">it the first thing they need to do is</text>
  <text start="3498.589" dur="4.391">they need to take the people inside the</text>
  <text start="3501.24" dur="4.26">intelligence community the DOJ and the</text>

  <text start="3731.47" dur="5.7">the FBI and DOJ ISIL</text>
  <text start="3733.27" dur="7.26">so they can&amp;#39;t cause any trouble you give</text>
  <text start="3737.17" dur="4.98">them a job where they are removed from</text>
  <text start="3740.53" dur="3.21">their normal duties and they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3742.15" dur="4.83">be put on a little task for us a little</text>

  <text start="3746.98" dur="9.39">on a very very important job it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3753.64" dur="15.51">cover story that is too good for them to</text>
  <text start="3756.37" dur="17.7">not accept the assignment so Trump fires</text>
  <text start="3769.15" dur="9.27">Comey who makes a very public campaign</text>
  <text start="3774.07" dur="7.89">of open leaking to the media crying out</text>

  <text start="3785.23" dur="10.62">to investigate the evil Trump all right</text>

  <text start="3830.08" dur="4.02">this is the best assignment this is the</text>
  <text start="3831.64" dur="6.12">coolest assignment world so they</text>
  <text start="3834.1" dur="6.51">basically set up a wild goose chase for</text>
  <text start="3837.76" dur="5.31">this team to go after and take them out</text>
  <text start="3840.61" dur="10.86">of their normal job to kind of isolate</text>
  <text start="3843.07" dur="10.74">them so Muller assembles a team he gets</text>
  <text start="3851.47" dur="3.6">his people going they&amp;#39;re investigating</text>
  <text start="3853.81" dur="4.28">they&amp;#39;re looking into whatever they want</text>

  <text start="3872.99" dur="4.35">and do whatever they want right they</text>
  <text start="3875.6" dur="4.67">think that they are going after a real</text>
  <text start="3877.34" dur="8.94">collusion real pay-for-play</text>
  <text start="3880.27" dur="9.43">but the entire time Horowitz who is the</text>
  <text start="3886.28" dur="6.51">Inspector General is investigating them</text>
  <text start="3889.7" dur="5.31">while they&amp;#39;re investigating Trump they</text>
  <text start="3892.79" dur="4.47">are all under investigation by Horowitz</text>
  <text start="3895.01" dur="3.9">the Office of Inspector General well</text>

  <text start="3908.81" dur="4.74">or was entered into disciplinary action</text>
  <text start="3910.79" dur="5.01">while these people are going through</text>
  <text start="3913.55" dur="5.46">this Trump investigation they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="3915.8" dur="5.73">being investigated and they&amp;#39;re all being</text>
  <text start="3919.01" dur="5.19">entered into disciplinary action while</text>
  <text start="3921.53" dur="3.06">they&amp;#39;re on Muller&amp;#39;s team how crazy is</text>
  <text start="3924.2" dur="3.06">that</text>
  <text start="3924.59" dur="5.31">when does that happen it almost seems</text>
  <text start="3927.26" dur="4.29">like Trump kind of had a plan like let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3929.9" dur="3.54">get these guys over here get them</text>
  <text start="3931.55" dur="5.34">distracted and we&amp;#39;ll have the Office of</text>

  <text start="3946.13" dur="2.91">go by</text>
  <text start="3946.73" dur="5.07">Muller&amp;#39;s team is inside what is actually</text>
  <text start="3949.04" dur="4.92">a holding cell frantically trying to</text>
  <text start="3951.8" dur="4.7">manufacture collusion cases against</text>
  <text start="3953.96" dur="6.78">Trump&amp;#39;s people while Horowitz is</text>
  <text start="3956.5" dur="7.87">investigating them how do we know that</text>

  <text start="3981.71" dur="5.49">Inspector General and it&amp;#39;s also leaking</text>
  <text start="3985.91" dur="3.24">out to the press which is kind of cool</text>
  <text start="3987.2" dur="4.26">because once the press gets it and we</text>
  <text start="3989.15" dur="3.57">get it and if they hold open</text>
  <text start="3991.46" dur="3.78">congressional hearings so we get it</text>
  <text start="3992.72" dur="4.92">firsthand all right so we&amp;#39;re at the end</text>
  <text start="3995.24" dur="3.69">of the thread here what we&amp;#39;re seeing now</text>
  <text start="3997.64" dur="6.35">is people</text>
  <text start="3998.93" dur="7.74">like Bruce or Andrew McCabe Peter struck</text>
  <text start="4003.99" dur="5.079">the interesting thing about Bill pre</text>
  <text start="4006.67" dur="5.669">step so just give you some information</text>
  <text start="4009.069" dur="7.591">here bill pre step is the head of the</text>

  <text start="4019.14" dur="6.639">his deputy is Peter struck struck is</text>
  <text start="4023.109" dur="3.631">heavily involved bill pre step hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4025.779" dur="2.461">been mentioned in any congressional</text>
  <text start="4026.74" dur="3.66">hearings he hasn&amp;#39;t been mentioned in the</text>
  <text start="4028.24" dur="3.539">news he hasn&amp;#39;t been leaked on he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="4030.4" dur="3.27">in the Office of Inspector General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4031.779" dur="5.34">report</text>
  <text start="4033.67" dur="5.129">Sundance who is the last refuge suspects</text>
  <text start="4037.119" dur="4.131">that pre staff hasn&amp;#39;t been mentioned</text>
  <text start="4038.799" dur="6.361">because pre staff has actually flipped</text>
  <text start="4041.25" dur="8.619">he suspect Sundance suspects that priest</text>
  <text start="4045.16" dur="6.389">at saw this all going down realized it</text>
  <text start="4049.869" dur="2.97">was a trap realize they&amp;#39;re all gonna be</text>
  <text start="4051.549" dur="5.55">prosecuted and they&amp;#39;re all going to jail</text>
  <text start="4052.839" dur="7.47">pre step probably went to the bosses and</text>
  <text start="4057.099" dur="5.22">said okay look I I want to turn state&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4060.309" dur="4.411">evidence I&amp;#39;ll tell you guys everything I</text>
  <text start="4062.319" dur="3.841">know I want a light sentence or no</text>
  <text start="4064.72" dur="4.26">sentence and I&amp;#39;ll tell you guys</text>
  <text start="4066.16" dur="4.83">everything it is it&amp;#39;s a theory because</text>
  <text start="4068.98" dur="4.319">pre step hasn&amp;#39;t been mentioned in a this</text>
  <text start="4070.99" dur="4.859">and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s possible that pre</text>
  <text start="4073.299" dur="4.621">step could be working with all these</text>
  <text start="4075.849" dur="3.631">people and not know what&amp;#39;s going on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4077.92" dur="4.29">I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s believable that he</text>
  <text start="4079.48" dur="4.379">was out of the loop so if he&amp;#39;s not being</text>
  <text start="4082.21" dur="4.109">mentioned in any of this he may have</text>
  <text start="4083.859" dur="4.74">flipped already so that&amp;#39;s something to</text>
  <text start="4086.319" dur="5.28">think about that is the end of the</text>
  <text start="4088.599" dur="7.081">thread I just find it very interesting</text>
  <text start="4091.599" dur="5.551">that looking back in hindsight at what</text>
  <text start="4095.68" dur="2.88">we&amp;#39;re seeing in this congressional</text>
  <text start="4097.15" dur="4.339">hearings and what we&amp;#39;re seeing come out</text>
  <text start="4098.56" dur="6.15">and the Office of Inspector General</text>
  <text start="4101.489" dur="5.141">investigation and how Muller&amp;#39;s team is</text>
  <text start="4104.71" dur="4.489">falling apart his investigation is</text>
  <text start="4106.63" dur="6.479">burning to the ground it just seems like</text>
  <text start="4109.199" dur="7.27">like there was a deliberate attempt by</text>
  <text start="4113.109" dur="5.4">Trump&amp;#39;s team to sabotage Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4116.469" dur="3.991">investigation from the beginning and</text>
