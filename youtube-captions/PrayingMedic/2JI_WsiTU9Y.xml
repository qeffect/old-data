  <text start="11.75" dur="6.91">good afternoon good evening and good</text>
  <text start="14.849" dur="9.35">morning wherever you are from tuning in</text>
  <text start="18.66" dur="10.199">that I</text>
  <text start="24.199" dur="7.541">I hated whether I was going to do a</text>
  <text start="28.859" dur="4.771">broadcast today and then I heard the</text>
  <text start="31.74" dur="3.479">president&amp;#39;s remarks this morning from</text>
  <text start="33.63" dur="3.449">the White House on Iran and I was like</text>
  <text start="35.219" dur="5.011">there&amp;#39;s no way I cannot do a broadcast</text>
  <text start="37.079" dur="5.761">on this it&amp;#39;s not just that the president</text>
  <text start="40.23" dur="4.68">had some very interesting statements</text>
  <text start="42.84" dur="8.64">this morning from the White House as</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="8.07">he&amp;#39;s meeting with mr. Trudeau but I had</text>
  <text start="51.48" dur="4.5">a very interesting dream last night that</text>
  <text start="52.98" dur="7.86">I think provides some some data points</text>
  <text start="55.98" dur="8.34">that are good to consider with respect</text>
  <text start="60.84" dur="5.55">to Iran and what is going on so people</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="4.68">have been asking if you want to be part</text>
  <text start="66.39" dur="4.35">of the digital army what kind of tools</text>
  <text start="69" dur="5.13">do you need well having a little lapel</text>
  <text start="70.74" dur="6.87">mic these are inexpensive is not a bad</text>
  <text start="74.13" dur="5.33">idea all right so we&amp;#39;re gonna play this</text>
  <text start="77.61" dur="4.89">clip for you just listen to it and</text>
  <text start="79.46" dur="5.53">there&amp;#39;s a bunch of data points in this</text>
  <text start="82.5" dur="5.189">very short video that we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="84.99" dur="4.379">talk about a lot of them and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="3.211">to cover them one by one and some other</text>
  <text start="89.369" dur="4.86">things that Q&amp;#39;s talked about I&amp;#39;ll talk a</text>
  <text start="90.9" dur="7.23">lot about Q actually Q has had a lot to</text>
  <text start="94.229" dur="5.911">say about this operation and if you take</text>
  <text start="98.13" dur="4.769">in that data along with the new data</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="5.189">that we&amp;#39;re getting it paints a picture a</text>
  <text start="102.899" dur="7.321">pretty clear picture I think all right</text>
  <text start="105.329" dur="8.311">so a reporter asked the president about</text>
  <text start="110.22" dur="5.969">his comments last night that he made on</text>
  <text start="113.64" dur="6.479">the Hannity show about Iran is a</text>
  <text start="116.189" dur="6.39">different country now then the country</text>
  <text start="120.119" dur="4.051">they were when he took office so that is</text>
  <text start="122.579" dur="4.461">where we&amp;#39;re going to start I&amp;#39;m gonna let</text>
  <text start="124.17" dur="2.87">you listen to this real quick</text>
  <text start="127.9" dur="6.78">you stole it oh absolutely when I came</text>
  <text start="130.869" dur="6.781">here or Iran was in 14 to 18 different</text>
  <text start="134.68" dur="4.65">sites of confliction they were extremely</text>
  <text start="137.65" dur="3">hostile they were hostile when they</text>
  <text start="139.33" dur="4.17">decided to deal they were screaming</text>
  <text start="140.65" dur="7.61">death to America and I think probably</text>
  <text start="143.5" dur="9.69">Iran made a mistake I would okay so</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="9.4">first thing I want to talk about even</text>
  <text start="153.19" dur="8.82">though it is not obvious to the casual</text>
  <text start="157.66" dur="9.81">observer that Iran has changed in any</text>
  <text start="162.01" dur="6.99">significant way since Trump took office</text>
  <text start="167.47" dur="4.11">it looks like they&amp;#39;re still sponsoring</text>
  <text start="169" dur="5.13">terrorism other than Isis has been</text>
  <text start="171.58" dur="4.8">pretty much decimated to the casual</text>
  <text start="174.13" dur="4.29">observer to the person out there the nor</text>
  <text start="176.38" dur="5.37">me who&amp;#39;s just looking at this they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="178.42" dur="5.25">see Iran as a different country from now</text>
  <text start="181.75" dur="6">from when Trump took over Trump is</text>
  <text start="183.67" dur="7.08">saying he is telling us Iran is a</text>
  <text start="187.75" dur="5.91">different country very different they</text>
  <text start="190.75" dur="6.42">were they had their hands in all these</text>
  <text start="193.66" dur="7.17">areas of conflict in in in the Middle</text>
  <text start="197.17" dur="6.66">East mostly and he is telling us they</text>
  <text start="200.83" dur="5.7">are no longer involved in as many</text>
  <text start="203.83" dur="4.26">conflicts as they used to be things have</text>
  <text start="206.53" dur="3.78">changed now</text>
  <text start="208.09" dur="4.44">the mainstream media is going to</text>
  <text start="210.31" dur="4.14">challenge him on every single point that</text>
  <text start="212.53" dur="3.42">he makes they&amp;#39;re going to say where&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="214.45" dur="2.55">the evidence where is the proof they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="215.95" dur="3.36">still doing this they&amp;#39;re still doing</text>
  <text start="217" dur="4.38">that they shot down our drone why do you</text>
  <text start="219.31" dur="4.31">say such things right because whatever</text>
  <text start="221.38" dur="4.98">Trump says that he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="223.62" dur="7.63">challenged if he doesn&amp;#39;t produce the</text>
  <text start="226.36" dur="7.11">evidence so and then he said I think</text>
  <text start="231.25" dur="3.75">someone made a mistake concerning the</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="5.16">drones that was shot down last night</text>
  <text start="235" dur="7.83">no this is very interesting so let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="238.63" dur="6.45">cover that part of it a mistake I would</text>
  <text start="242.83" dur="5.25">imagine it was a general or somebody</text>
  <text start="245.08" dur="5.34">that made a mistake than shooting that</text>
  <text start="248.08" dur="6.54">drone down and fortunately that drone</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="8.58">was unarmed it was not okay so</text>
  <text start="254.62" dur="6.81">knowing that Trump has access to all the</text>
  <text start="259" dur="6.18">best intelligence on the planet</text>
  <text start="261.43" dur="5.04">if Trump says you know I think somebody</text>
  <text start="265.18" dur="3.84">in the chain of command made a mistake</text>
  <text start="266.47" dur="5.31">somebody got a little itchy trigger</text>
  <text start="269.02" dur="4.05">finger ordered a a missile to be</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="4.139">launched at that drone and took it down</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="4.349">wasn&amp;#39;t Dober Iranian airspace was over</text>
  <text start="275.919" dur="4.411">international waters</text>
  <text start="277.419" dur="5.371">I think somebody screwed up and made a</text>
  <text start="280.33" dur="5.39">mistake all right now would trump say</text>
  <text start="282.79" dur="6.36">that publicly if he didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="285.72" dur="6.97">intelligence to back him up guarantee</text>
  <text start="289.15" dur="4.98">you when that drone got hit Trump was in</text>
  <text start="292.69" dur="5.49">the Situation Room getting a briefing</text>
  <text start="294.13" dur="10.43">shortly thereafter and they told him</text>
  <text start="298.18" dur="6.38">what they knew and I&amp;#39;m sure they had</text>
  <text start="305.61" dur="5.11">audio probably recordings of</text>
  <text start="309.639" dur="5.941">conversations</text>
  <text start="310.72" dur="6.62">maybe cables emails whatever where the</text>
  <text start="315.58" dur="4.709">orders were given to launch that thing</text>
  <text start="317.34" dur="7.69">so if Trump is going to say that he</text>
  <text start="320.289" dur="5.821">believes it&amp;#39;s a rogue operator all right</text>
  <text start="325.03" dur="4.38">and we&amp;#39;re going to talk a lot about</text>
  <text start="326.11" dur="6.239">rogue operators if Trump is essentially</text>
  <text start="329.41" dur="6.45">saying that he believes it was a rogue</text>
  <text start="332.349" dur="5.101">operator inside the Iranian regime who</text>
  <text start="335.86" dur="5.79">did this and probably the military</text>
  <text start="337.45" dur="7.82">regime then what he&amp;#39;s signaling to us</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="8.48">that he&amp;#39;s not going to say overtly is</text>
  <text start="345.27" dur="8.619">that the majority of the Iranian</text>
  <text start="350.13" dur="7.36">leadership would not support this it was</text>
  <text start="353.889" dur="7.921">a rogue who did it now why is that</text>
  <text start="357.49" dur="5.429">important it&amp;#39;s very important you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="361.81" dur="4.74">going to hear people in the mainstream</text>
  <text start="362.919" dur="7.56">media in the new media pushing this</text>
  <text start="366.55" dur="5.4">agenda this narrative really that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="370.479" dur="2.16">gonna go to war on Iran and it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="371.95" dur="3.39">eventualities</text>
  <text start="372.639" dur="5.371">at history we always go to war on Iran</text>
  <text start="375.34" dur="5.009">this is just a pretext for war Trump</text>
  <text start="378.01" dur="5.88">doesn&amp;#39;t have a plan other than war</text>
  <text start="380.349" dur="5.041">so it&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before we</text>
  <text start="383.89" dur="4.2">end up in a war all right</text>
  <text start="385.39" dur="7.26">you&amp;#39;re gonna hear that narrative however</text>
  <text start="388.09" dur="7.95">if we look at not just what Trump has</text>
  <text start="392.65" dur="7.68">said but what Trump has done with</text>
  <text start="396.04" dur="8.34">respect to bad actors I think there is a</text>
  <text start="400.33" dur="7.309">lot of evidence to suggest Trump has no</text>
  <text start="404.38" dur="6.81">plans to go to war in fact his plan is</text>
  <text start="407.639" dur="5.53">to broker a peace agreement all right</text>
  <text start="411.19" dur="6.06">we&amp;#39;re just at a critical point where</text>
  <text start="413.169" dur="6.091">there are factions inside the Iranian</text>
  <text start="417.25" dur="7.7">regime who are having a little bit of</text>
  <text start="419.26" dur="12.719">disagreement now let&amp;#39;s talk about q so</text>
  <text start="424.95" dur="9.43">back in November of 2017 when the</text>
  <text start="431.979" dur="2.94">president visited did his first trip to</text>
  <text start="434.38" dur="3.15">Asia</text>
  <text start="434.919" dur="5.431">he went to China he visited Japan he</text>
  <text start="437.53" dur="4.65">visited South Korea he did kind of a - I</text>
  <text start="440.35" dur="6.62">think he went to Indonesia a bunch of</text>
  <text start="442.18" dur="8.16">different places in in the Far East</text>
  <text start="446.97" dur="5.98">interesting to note that President Trump</text>
  <text start="450.34" dur="4.32">went to China and visited the Forbidden</text>
  <text start="452.95" dur="5.01">City it was a first sitting president</text>
  <text start="454.66" dur="5.22">ever to visit the Forbidden City right</text>
  <text start="457.96" dur="7.62">President Xi took him - Forbidden City</text>
  <text start="459.88" dur="7.409">they hung out right now Q was posting</text>
  <text start="465.58" dur="4.83">pictures that looked to be from Air</text>
  <text start="467.289" dur="8.431">Force One in November while President</text>
  <text start="470.41" dur="8.61">was traveling to Asia now this becomes</text>
  <text start="475.72" dur="6.75">relevant because when those pictures</text>
  <text start="479.02" dur="10.47">were posted on 4chan in November of 2017</text>
  <text start="482.47" dur="10.169">later on in March of 2018 when it</text>
  <text start="489.49" dur="7.29">started to sound as if Trump was going</text>
  <text start="492.639" dur="5.611">to meet with Kim North Korea to talk</text>
  <text start="496.78" dur="2.4">maybe terms of peace and</text>
  <text start="498.25" dur="4.05">denuclearization</text>
  <text start="499.18" dur="8.16">this was after Kim had been launching</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="7.65">missiles missile tests escalating the</text>
  <text start="507.34" dur="6.15">missile testing and Trump was on Twitter</text>
  <text start="509.95" dur="5.73">pushing back against him and all this</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="7.229">concern Trump&amp;#39;s gonna get us in a war</text>
  <text start="515.68" dur="8.37">with North Korea right so Trump is</text>
  <text start="520.719" dur="7.021">as Kim is escalating tensions as a</text>
  <text start="524.05" dur="6.51">mainstream media are and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="527.74" dur="4.589">in the new media were freaking out that</text>
  <text start="530.56" dur="6.199">Trump doesn&amp;#39;t have a plan he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="532.329" dur="8.341">push Kim into a war and lo and behold</text>
  <text start="536.759" dur="8.411">Trump and Kim set up a summit to talk</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="9.229">peace in Singapore right now at that</text>
  <text start="545.17" dur="9.029">time when early very early on in March q</text>
  <text start="549.899" dur="11.43">suggested that Trump had actually met</text>
  <text start="554.199" dur="7.13">with Kim previously face-to-face q said</text>
  <text start="562.019" dur="4.151">have they already met think Forbidden</text>
  <text start="565.569" dur="4.291">City</text>
  <text start="566.17" dur="7.56">POTUS never crossed the line all right</text>
  <text start="569.86" dur="6.45">so Q was suggesting that Kim secretly</text>
  <text start="573.73" dur="4.5">met with Trump and President Xi in a</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="3.3">Forbidden City when Trump visited Asia</text>
  <text start="578.23" dur="5.88">in November of 2017</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="7.769">and that they had began begun to work</text>
  <text start="584.11" dur="5.149">out the deal the the some of the details</text>
  <text start="587.379" dur="7.32">of a potential peace agreement</text>
  <text start="589.259" dur="8.38">denuclearization and prior to that and</text>
  <text start="594.699" dur="5.01">after that Trump was putting a lot of</text>
  <text start="597.639" dur="4.62">economic sanctions on North Korea he was</text>
  <text start="599.709" dur="6.661">just hammering them with economic</text>
  <text start="602.259" dur="5.791">sanctions and he&amp;#39;s been using tariffs</text>
  <text start="606.37" dur="4.23">and economic sanctions against China and</text>
  <text start="608.05" dur="7.019">Iran and a lot of other bad actors to</text>
  <text start="610.6" dur="6.419">get them to realize that it is in their</text>
  <text start="615.069" dur="6.81">best interest if they cooperate with</text>
  <text start="617.019" dur="8.49">Trump&amp;#39;s agenda all right so when most</text>
  <text start="621.879" dur="7.44">people thought that Trump was going to</text>
  <text start="625.509" dur="6.781">get us into a war with North Korea what</text>
  <text start="629.319" dur="5.52">he was in fact doing if you go back and</text>
  <text start="632.29" dur="4.95">look at what Pompeo is doing Pompeyo was</text>
  <text start="634.839" dur="4.651">in South Korea he was in North Korea he</text>
  <text start="637.24" dur="6.409">was in China he was in Vietnam Japan</text>
  <text start="639.49" dur="6.93">Pompeyo was flying all over the place in</text>
  <text start="643.649" dur="7.151">November December January February all</text>
  <text start="646.42" dur="6.81">that time Pompeyo was just all the time</text>
  <text start="650.8" dur="3.82">flying around in the Far East with</text>
  <text start="653.23" dur="5.05">meetings</text>
  <text start="654.62" dur="6.82">Pompeyo was setting the groundwork for</text>
  <text start="658.28" dur="5.38">the peace talks that were going to come</text>
  <text start="661.44" dur="3.93">in Singapore that happened I think in</text>
  <text start="663.66" dur="6.03">June of 2018</text>
  <text start="665.37" dur="7.17">June 12th is when Kim and Trump met if</text>
  <text start="669.69" dur="6.05">I&amp;#39;m not mistaken now so</text>
  <text start="672.54" dur="5.94">Pompeyo was laying all this ground work</text>
  <text start="675.74" dur="4.18">behind the scenes mostly there you could</text>
  <text start="678.48" dur="3.84">if you were paying attention to what</text>
  <text start="679.92" dur="4.56">Pompey was doing you would see that he</text>
  <text start="682.32" dur="5.21">was connecting with a lot of people a</text>
  <text start="684.48" dur="5.88">lot of important players in the Far East</text>
  <text start="687.53" dur="4.48">but you didn&amp;#39;t know where it was going</text>
  <text start="690.36" dur="3.87">until it was announced that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="692.01" dur="6.63">gonna have the summit with Kim and Trump</text>
  <text start="694.23" dur="8.25">in Singapore and it&amp;#39;s true we don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="698.64" dur="12.24">a peace agreement yet but what Trump is</text>
  <text start="702.48" dur="12">doing is he is offering to Kim a an</text>
  <text start="710.88" dur="5.88">economy and a chance to live in the in</text>
  <text start="714.48" dur="5.94">the benefits of 21st century like South</text>
  <text start="716.76" dur="6.75">Korea having it build up an economy have</text>
  <text start="720.42" dur="5.19">your people have some prosperity have a</text>
  <text start="723.51" dur="4.26">seat at the table with you know normal</text>
  <text start="725.61" dur="2.46">normalized diplomatic relations all</text>
  <text start="727.77" dur="4.41">right</text>
  <text start="728.07" dur="6.33">Trump offered that to Kim and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="732.18" dur="3.75">had their meetings and I think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="734.4" dur="4.8">gonna have future meetings Trump</text>
  <text start="735.93" dur="7.97">basically said told us Kim is not ready</text>
  <text start="739.2" dur="9.06">at this time to accept that offer</text>
  <text start="743.9" dur="6.46">and so Trump is has put his offer on a</text>
  <text start="748.26" dur="5.46">table he has shown Kim what&amp;#39;s possible</text>
  <text start="750.36" dur="7.08">he has shown him what he is willing to</text>
  <text start="753.72" dur="6.06">do to help modernize North Korea and Kim</text>
  <text start="757.44" dur="5.54">is not at the point now where he&amp;#39;s ready</text>
  <text start="759.78" dur="5.52">to accept that offer but what Q said</text>
  <text start="762.98" dur="3.79">didn&amp;#39;t come out and say that but very</text>
  <text start="765.3" dur="3.51">strongly implied that there were a lot</text>

  <text start="796.96" dur="5.65">back-channel communications going on all</text>
  <text start="799.73" dur="9.35">right now let&amp;#39;s look at let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="802.61" dur="6.47">Iran for a minute so Q has told us that</text>
  <text start="809.59" dur="6.94">and Q doesn&amp;#39;t come out and say by the</text>
  <text start="814.13" dur="6.33">way North Korea is actually being run by</text>
  <text start="816.53" dur="5.97">the CIA q will ask you a question who is</text>
  <text start="820.46" dur="4.41">in control who controls North Korea and</text>
  <text start="822.5" dur="4.89">then ask you another question who really</text>
  <text start="824.87" dur="6.36">controls North Korea alright</text>
  <text start="827.39" dur="5.64">so q in an indirect way says there is</text>
  <text start="831.23" dur="4.73">someone controlling North Korea that Yi</text>
  <text start="833.03" dur="6.65">most people don&amp;#39;t suspect right and then</text>
  <text start="835.96" dur="6.67">when the announcement was made that</text>
  <text start="839.68" dur="7.3">Trump was gonna be meeting with Kim Q</text>
  <text start="842.63" dur="8.28">posted strings cut deal made clowns out</text>
  <text start="846.98" dur="6.3">we took control Thank You Kim so q</text>
  <text start="850.91" dur="5.46">suggested that they got rid of the seeit</text>
  <text start="853.28" dur="6.3">rogue CIA elements that were in North</text>
  <text start="856.37" dur="4.95">Korea they cut the strings of control</text>
  <text start="859.58" dur="4.17">they freed up Kim to be able to</text>
  <text start="861.32" dur="4.77">negotiate with Trump all right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="863.75" dur="4.74">all part of the process the reason why</text>
  <text start="866.09" dur="5.34">Kim was building weapons of mass</text>
  <text start="868.49" dur="5.22">destruction was it that was the agenda</text>
  <text start="871.43" dur="4.95">of the deep State and the CIA they</text>
  <text start="873.71" dur="5.31">wanted to create a couple of countries</text>
  <text start="876.38" dur="4.65">rogue nations that would they would give</text>
  <text start="879.02" dur="4.68">nuclear weapons to North Korea one of</text>
  <text start="881.03" dur="5.61">them Iran is the other one right so</text>
  <text start="883.7" dur="4.98">Trump knew coming in he had to</text>
  <text start="886.64" dur="4.59">denuclearize North Korea and he has to</text>
  <text start="888.68" dur="6.33">denuclearize Iran those are his two main</text>
  <text start="891.23" dur="5.94">objectives from a from the geopolitical</text>
  <text start="895.01" dur="4.53">front those are the two biggest threats</text>
  <text start="897.17" dur="6">he has right now he has managed to</text>
  <text start="899.54" dur="8.67">successfully get recruit Kim to peace</text>
  <text start="903.17" dur="6.66">negotiations and cease his development</text>
  <text start="908.21" dur="2.91">of nuclear weapons even though there</text>
  <text start="909.83" dur="3.9">have been some small missile launches</text>
  <text start="911.12" dur="5.84">there small missile launches and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="913.73" dur="6.24">know that they&amp;#39;re all that relevant and</text>
  <text start="916.96" dur="4.77">speaking of missile launches remember</text>
  <text start="919.97" dur="5.479">June 9th 10th</text>
  <text start="921.73" dur="6.78">eleventh and twelfth Trump was meeting</text>
  <text start="925.449" dur="8.851">in Canada with a bunch of economic</text>
  <text start="928.51" dur="9.569">leaders on the 9th and 10th then he left</text>
  <text start="934.3" dur="8.909">Canada and he flew to Singapore to meet</text>
  <text start="938.079" dur="7.291">with Kim around that same time there was</text>
  <text start="943.209" dur="5.49">a missile that was launched over Whidbey</text>
  <text start="945.37" dur="7.469">Island no it was not a missile that was</text>
  <text start="948.699" dur="5.731">launched at Air Force One it wasn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="952.839" dur="3.841">cannot hit an airplane with an</text>
  <text start="954.43" dur="5.64">intercontinental ballistic missile you</text>
  <text start="956.68" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t fire ICBMs at airplanes from from</text>
  <text start="960.07" dur="5.67">what it looks like look Bangor sub-base</text>
  <text start="961.72" dur="5.16">is there in the Hood Canal I am very</text>
  <text start="965.74" dur="5.039">familiar with that area having worked</text>
  <text start="966.88" dur="10.37">there for a long time and it looks it</text>
  <text start="970.779" dur="11.43">looked as if a rogue actor had illegally</text>
  <text start="977.25" dur="9.54">launched a missile from my submarine in</text>
  <text start="982.209" dur="9.24">the Hood Canal as a potential false flag</text>
  <text start="986.79" dur="7.299">to screw up the talks that Trump was</text>
  <text start="991.449" dur="4.89">gonna have with Kim and it looks like</text>
  <text start="994.089" dur="4.44">our military people detected the missile</text>
  <text start="996.339" dur="3.661">launch shot the missile down and then</text>
  <text start="998.529" dur="3.06">nothing was said about it and then the</text>
  <text start="1000" dur="6.12">mainstream media covers it and says it</text>
  <text start="1001.589" dur="7.591">was glare lens flare reflections of a</text>
  <text start="1006.12" dur="5.64">helicopter yeah whatever that was it was</text>
  <text start="1009.18" dur="4.08">it was a missile being popped off from a</text>
  <text start="1011.76" dur="2.189">submarine in the Hood Canal as if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1013.26" dur="6.059">what that was</text>
  <text start="1013.949" dur="8.58">anyway the point being it looks very</text>
  <text start="1019.319" dur="6.211">much like there was a rogue inside the</text>
  <text start="1022.529" dur="5.55">military that was able to launch that</text>
  <text start="1025.53" dur="4.649">missile now that&amp;#39;s one possibility the</text>
  <text start="1028.079" dur="4.141">other possibility is that the CIA</text>
  <text start="1030.179" dur="6">themselves they have their own</text>
  <text start="1032.22" dur="5.82">submarines with missiles and we know</text>
  <text start="1036.179" dur="4.65">they have their own drone Air Force</text>
  <text start="1038.04" dur="8.039">right so the CIA they have their own</text>
  <text start="1040.829" dur="8.85">military assets and what Trump is doing</text>
  <text start="1046.079" dur="6.271">is he is battling has been battling</text>
  <text start="1049.679" dur="4.861">rogue elements in the CIA State</text>
  <text start="1052.35" dur="3.3">Department Department of Defense that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1054.54" dur="4.95">the deep state</text>
  <text start="1055.65" dur="5.22">that is the military end of the deep sea</text>
  <text start="1059.49" dur="2.88">there&amp;#39;s a political end which is</text>
  <text start="1060.87" dur="3.99">politicians and there&amp;#39;s a military end</text>
  <text start="1062.37" dur="5.88">which is you know their drone Air Force</text>
  <text start="1064.86" dur="5.64">and if they have I strongly suspect the</text>
  <text start="1068.25" dur="9.21">CIA has probably purchased submarines</text>
  <text start="1070.5" dur="13.01">and other military hardware so q asked a</text>
  <text start="1077.46" dur="9.96">rhetorical question did the deep state</text>
  <text start="1083.51" dur="7.18">specifically the CA think with their</text>
  <text start="1087.42" dur="5.9">offshore assets that they could stand</text>
  <text start="1090.69" dur="6.63">against the president and the military</text>
  <text start="1093.32" dur="9.48">if they were united together right so</text>
  <text start="1097.32" dur="10.65">the CIA and the deep State calculated</text>
  <text start="1102.8" dur="10.18">that they could oppose Trump and the</text>
  <text start="1107.97" dur="10.85">military with their assets and that they</text>
  <text start="1112.98" dur="5.84">could possibly win now why did Obama</text>
  <text start="1118.91" dur="9.34">draw down funding for the military</text>
  <text start="1123.62" dur="6.91">because Obama&amp;#39;s part of his agenda was</text>
  <text start="1128.25" dur="4.23">to weaken the military and weaken the</text>
  <text start="1130.53" dur="6.42">influence and the ability of Patriots</text>
  <text start="1132.48" dur="6.48">who would oppose the deep state the plan</text>
  <text start="1136.95" dur="3.27">was to weaken weaken the military</text>
  <text start="1138.96" dur="3.99">Hillary would get in she would continue</text>
  <text start="1140.22" dur="5.459">to weaken the military they would take</text>
  <text start="1142.95" dur="6.09">out Patriots in the military like</text>
  <text start="1145.679" dur="4.981">general Flynn and they would continue</text>
  <text start="1149.04" dur="4.44">removing Patriots in the military</text>
  <text start="1150.66" dur="5.16">continue weakening it and strengthen the</text>
  <text start="1153.48" dur="6.15">deep state that their CIA the assets and</text>
  <text start="1155.82" dur="5.52">the black ops right so that was their</text>
  <text start="1159.63" dur="4.799">plan part of the sixteen year plan to</text>
  <text start="1161.34" dur="8.85">destroy America Trump comes in first</text>
  <text start="1164.429" dur="8.031">thing Trump does is negotiates massive</text>
  <text start="1170.19" dur="4.41">increases in military spending why</text>
  <text start="1172.46" dur="4.57">because Trump is working with the</text>
  <text start="1174.6" dur="5.28">military against the deep state and the</text>
  <text start="1177.03" dur="4.23">military is his main is really the only</text>
  <text start="1179.88" dur="3.06">part of government that&amp;#39;s backing him</text>
  <text start="1181.26" dur="3.78">every other part of government was</text>
  <text start="1182.94" dur="4.86">working to get struck except the</text>
  <text start="1185.04" dur="4.339">military the first thing Trump does is</text>
  <text start="1187.8" dur="4.4">negotiates a mess</text>
  <text start="1189.379" dur="7.66">increase of expenditure for the military</text>
  <text start="1192.2" dur="8.859">right and he does that because they are</text>
  <text start="1197.039" dur="6.061">his main ally and he is in a war against</text>
  <text start="1201.059" dur="3.811">the deep state and their assets so you</text>
  <text start="1203.1" dur="3.209">have the deep state and their assets and</text>
  <text start="1204.87" dur="4.789">you have Trump in the military and</text>
  <text start="1206.309" dur="3.35">they&amp;#39;re working against each other now</text>
  <text start="1210.529" dur="7.63">Trump is has been working on cleaning</text>
  <text start="1214.499" dur="5.851">out corruption in the FBI in the</text>
  <text start="1218.159" dur="7.701">Department of Justice State Department</text>
  <text start="1220.35" dur="8.63">right Tillerson one of his main I think</text>
  <text start="1225.86" dur="10.659">objectives as Secretary of State was to</text>
  <text start="1228.98" dur="8.11">get rid of bad actors in the State</text>

  <text start="1239.61" dur="4.259">people in the State Department sessions</text>
  <text start="1241.95" dur="4.049">had to go in fire a lot of people in DOJ</text>
  <text start="1243.869" dur="5.31">and FBI chris ray is continuing to fire</text>
  <text start="1245.999" dur="7.101">people in the FBI Gina Haskell we know</text>
  <text start="1249.179" dur="6.36">has been getting rid of CIA bad actors</text>
  <text start="1253.1" dur="5.26">Attorney General William bar told us</text>
  <text start="1255.539" dur="6.09">that it is a point that no one talks</text>
  <text start="1258.36" dur="7.769">about but in his interview with this Fox</text>
  <text start="1261.629" dur="8.701">reporter about a month ago Barr said he</text>
  <text start="1266.129" dur="6.061">was talking about the spy gate and when</text>
  <text start="1270.33" dur="5.069">he was asked a question he said oh you</text>
  <text start="1272.19" dur="5.64">know the those people and the CIA and</text>
  <text start="1275.399" dur="3.9">the FBI and other intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="1277.83" dur="4.289">that were involved in us are no longer</text>
  <text start="1279.299" dur="5.49">working there right so Barr was kind of</text>
  <text start="1282.119" dur="5.15">telling people yeah a lot of these rogue</text>
  <text start="1284.789" dur="6.901">actors have been fired they&amp;#39;re gone</text>
  <text start="1287.269" dur="5.86">not all of them a lot of them so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1291.69" dur="4.17">understandable that people are</text>
  <text start="1293.129" dur="5.37">frustrated because they want to think</text>
  <text start="1295.86" dur="5.13">that Gina Haskell has completely gutted</text>
  <text start="1298.499" dur="5.461">the CIA of all rogue actors she has not</text>
  <text start="1300.99" dur="6.12">been able to do that that that is going</text>
  <text start="1303.96" dur="4.98">to take a lot of time it takes time I</text>
  <text start="1307.11" dur="3.33">was somebody messaged me on Twitter last</text>
  <text start="1308.94" dur="3.51">night and they worked for the government</text>
  <text start="1310.44" dur="4.26">and they work I don&amp;#39;t want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1312.45" dur="4.349">that apartment they work for but they</text>
  <text start="1314.7" dur="4.829">said you&amp;#39;ve been talking a lot about how</text>
  <text start="1316.799" dur="5.621">chris ray has successfully gotten rid of</text>
  <text start="1319.529" dur="10.311">james baker</text>

  <text start="1332.33" dur="5.33">been removed she said people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1335.03" dur="5.82">understand how difficult it is to remove</text>
  <text start="1337.66" dur="7.05">federal workers especially at that level</text>
  <text start="1340.85" dur="6.72">they have unions they have rules you</text>
  <text start="1344.71" dur="4.96">start creating a paper trail on them to</text>
  <text start="1347.57" dur="4.08">try to get rid of them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1349.67" dur="3.48">creating a paper trail on you trying to</text>
  <text start="1351.65" dur="4.26">prove that you are harassing them and</text>
  <text start="1353.15" dur="4.17">targeting them and she said as a federal</text>
  <text start="1355.91" dur="3.99">worker I can tell you it is almost</text>
  <text start="1357.32" dur="5.13">impossible to get rid of federal workers</text>
  <text start="1359.9" dur="6.48">at that level if Chris Rae has done that</text>
  <text start="1362.45" dur="6.21">much work it is it speaks highly of how</text>
  <text start="1366.38" dur="3.69">dedicated he is in getting rid of these</text>
  <text start="1368.66" dur="5.07">people because it&amp;#39;s very difficult to do</text>
  <text start="1370.07" dur="5.28">of course if you have the goods on them</text>
  <text start="1373.73" dur="3.74">and you know that they&amp;#39;ve involved in</text>
  <text start="1375.35" dur="5.66">criminal activity and you turn it over</text>
  <text start="1377.47" dur="6.43">to the DOJ for prosecution another story</text>
  <text start="1381.01" dur="4.87">then you pretty much have them sign an</text>
  <text start="1383.9" dur="3.9">agreement saying that there it&amp;#39;s a plea</text>
  <text start="1385.88" dur="3.45">deal and they&amp;#39;re going to cooperate with</text>
  <text start="1387.8" dur="4.67">the investigation and some of the people</text>
  <text start="1389.33" dur="5.13">who have left the FBI left as</text>
  <text start="1392.47" dur="3.79">cooperating witnesses some are just</text>
  <text start="1394.46" dur="3.84">fired if they wouldn&amp;#39;t cooperate they</text>
  <text start="1396.26" dur="5.61">just fire them and then prosecute them</text>
  <text start="1398.3" dur="6.45">later but that&amp;#39;s a rabbit trap so we</text>
  <text start="1401.87" dur="5.28">have to understand that the heads of the</text>
  <text start="1404.75" dur="5.64">intelligence agencies are working on</text>
  <text start="1407.15" dur="5.43">getting rid of bad actors rogue agents</text>
  <text start="1410.39" dur="4.29">there are there are when I say rogue</text>
  <text start="1412.58" dur="5.52">what I mean is people who are not</text>
  <text start="1414.68" dur="8.13">following the lead of their department</text>
  <text start="1418.1" dur="6.9">head so FBI people in agents and whoever</text>
  <text start="1422.81" dur="7.47">in in the FBI who are not following</text>
  <text start="1425" dur="9.39">Chris Rea and bar and Trump they would</text>
  <text start="1430.28" dur="6.6">be considered rogue actors same thing in</text>
  <text start="1434.39" dur="5.13">the CIA same thing in DOJ same thing in</text>
  <text start="1436.88" dur="5.58">State Department there are some rogue</text>
  <text start="1439.52" dur="4.44">actors who are still beholden to the</text>
  <text start="1442.46" dur="3">deep state and it&amp;#39;s only a matter of</text>
  <text start="1443.96" dur="6.66">time before they get discovered then I</text>
  <text start="1445.46" dur="8.41">get removed all right so hopefully that</text>
  <text start="1450.62" dur="6.16">kind of clears up a little bit about</text>
  <text start="1453.87" dur="7.08">who is on this battlefield and what</text>
  <text start="1456.78" dur="10.4">position they&amp;#39;re playing now Trump last</text>
  <text start="1460.95" dur="9.21">night talked about spying on Hannity</text>
  <text start="1467.18" dur="4.629">Trump says you know it would be it would</text>
  <text start="1470.16" dur="3.6">be very interesting to find out if they</text>
  <text start="1471.809" dur="4.561">if Obama wasn&amp;#39;t listening to my phone</text>
  <text start="1473.76" dur="4.65">calls I&amp;#39;m not saying he was but you know</text>
  <text start="1476.37" dur="3.689">it would be interesting to find that out</text>
  <text start="1478.41" dur="7.08">if we see if we will see what happens</text>
  <text start="1480.059" dur="6.481">right Trump in his in the speech in</text>
  <text start="1485.49" dur="3.35">Orlando</text>

  <text start="2345.119" dur="5.041">that I saw this morning with Trump</text>
  <text start="2346.349" dur="6.481">talking to the mainstream media so in</text>
  <text start="2350.16" dur="7.65">the dream Trump was talking to people at</text>
  <text start="2352.83" dur="6.99">large in the dream I could sense that</text>
  <text start="2357.81" dur="4.049">what he was saying was very very</text>
  <text start="2359.82" dur="5.43">important for people to listen to and</text>
  <text start="2361.859" dur="6.51">understand the problem is what he was</text>
  <text start="2365.25" dur="5.7">actually saying seemed very</text>
  <text start="2368.369" dur="4.411">inconsequential and it was hard to</text>
  <text start="2370.95" dur="3.72">understand it like he was talking about</text>
  <text start="2372.78" dur="5.46">abstract ideas and weird things that</text>
  <text start="2374.67" dur="4.619">people really didn&amp;#39;t in the natural and</text>

  <text start="2386.52" dur="5.4">media you think he&amp;#39;s having a stroke</text>
  <text start="2389.059" dur="6.97">because it didn&amp;#39;t make any sense it was</text>
  <text start="2391.92" dur="5.85">all random ideas however this dream was</text>
  <text start="2396.029" dur="6.211">not a literal drink it was a symbolic</text>
  <text start="2397.77" dur="7.019">dream right so the dream was telling me</text>
  <text start="2402.24" dur="7.23">as I thought about it this morning that</text>
  <text start="2404.789" dur="7.411">Trump doesn&amp;#39;t come out and tell</text>
  <text start="2409.47" dur="6.359">everybody up front in plain language</text>
  <text start="2412.2" dur="6.349">what they need to know you have to read</text>
  <text start="2415.829" dur="5.25">between the lines you have to infer</text>
  <text start="2418.549" dur="5.05">meaning based on what you know about</text>
  <text start="2421.079" dur="3.811">Trump in his past and his history and</text>
  <text start="2423.599" dur="3.421">what he&amp;#39;s done with other nations and</text>
  <text start="2424.89" dur="3.929">what he&amp;#39;s done in similar situations you</text>
  <text start="2427.02" dur="3.48">have to listen at what he says and go</text>
  <text start="2428.819" dur="3.151">what do you mean what kind of answer is</text>
  <text start="2430.5" dur="2.369">that you&amp;#39;re not being straight with us</text>
  <text start="2431.97" dur="3.899">you&amp;#39;re not telling us</text>
  <text start="2432.869" dur="7.23">straightforwardly in plain English what</text>
  <text start="2435.869" dur="6.271">is happening that is how Trump is that</text>
  <text start="2440.099" dur="5.25">is how Q is Q doesn&amp;#39;t come out because</text>
  <text start="2442.14" dur="6">of national security laws Q cannot come</text>
  <text start="2445.349" dur="5.541">out and tell us directly what is going</text>
  <text start="2448.14" dur="6.479">on behind the scenes q gives us hints</text>
  <text start="2450.89" dur="6.729">clues questions riddles and you have to</text>
  <text start="2454.619" dur="5.49">infer read between the lines what is</text>
  <text start="2457.619" dur="4.861">going on Trump is the same way a lot and</text>
  <text start="2460.109" dur="5.071">in the way that he is signalling to his</text>
  <text start="2462.48" dur="5.069">base he does it in a way that you just</text>
  <text start="2465.18" dur="4.409">have to infer meaning you have to read</text>
  <text start="2467.549" dur="5.631">between the lines I know that&amp;#39;s what he</text>
  <text start="2469.589" dur="8.76">said this is what he meant</text>
  <text start="2473.18" dur="7.78">so and and a lot of that can be done if</text>
  <text start="2478.349" dur="5.821">you understand the audience he&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="2480.96" dur="5.55">to because he talks somewhat differently</text>
  <text start="2484.17" dur="4.199">at a rally when he&amp;#39;s talking to his base</text>
  <text start="2486.51" dur="5.76">then when he&amp;#39;s talking to the mainstream</text>
  <text start="2488.369" dur="5.97">media who heart is enemies he talks</text>
  <text start="2492.27" dur="4.079">differently to them than he talks to us</text>
  <text start="2494.339" dur="6.99">he talks to us more plainly he talks to</text>
  <text start="2496.349" dur="7.95">them more obliquely more in abstract</text>
  <text start="2501.329" dur="5.52">terms and more in disinformation he is</text>
  <text start="2504.299" dur="5.79">trying to set them up for failure he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2506.849" dur="5.071">trying to set us up for success so when</text>
  <text start="2510.089" dur="2.611">you listen to Trump talk to the media</text>
  <text start="2511.92" dur="3.72">just remember</text>
  <text start="2512.7" dur="5.639">talking to his enemies and his goal many</text>
  <text start="2515.64" dur="6.78">times is to give them disinformation and</text>
  <text start="2518.339" dur="5.701">set them up so he&amp;#39;s just you know you</text>
  <text start="2522.42" dur="3.12">have to just realize that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2524.04" dur="3.62">always take what Trump says at face</text>
  <text start="2525.54" dur="2.12">value</text>
  <text start="2527.79" dur="6.539">read his body language look at his</text>
  <text start="2529.98" dur="8.849">smiles look at it just take in that his</text>
  <text start="2534.329" dur="5.941">overall effect and the way he interacts</text>
  <text start="2538.829" dur="6.27">with his people and realized a lot of</text>
  <text start="2540.27" dur="7.2">times he is he is signaling to us his</text>
  <text start="2545.099" dur="4.891">plans but he is setting them up for</text>
  <text start="2547.47" dur="5.67">failure and it that is a very difficult</text>
  <text start="2549.99" dur="6.69">thing to do you try it sometime</text>
  <text start="2553.14" dur="4.92">try talking to an enemy and a friend at</text>
  <text start="2556.68" dur="4.169">the same time giving them the same</text>
  <text start="2558.06" dur="5.039">message and try to signal to your friend</text>
  <text start="2560.849" dur="3.871">you&amp;#39;re correct intention and signal to</text>
  <text start="2563.099" dur="4.561">your enemy give them something that they</text>
  <text start="2564.72" dur="3.27">can&amp;#39;t use against you it&amp;#39;s not easy to</text>
  <text start="2567.66" dur="3.51">do</text>
  <text start="2567.99" dur="6.53">Trump does it really well I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="2571.17" dur="3.35">play one last clicker real quick</text>
  <text start="2579.47" dur="4.379">I don&amp;#39;t know I find it hard to believe</text>
  <text start="2582.349" dur="2.94">it was intentional if you want to know</text>
  <text start="2583.849" dur="4.411">the truth I think that it could have</text>
  <text start="2585.289" dur="6.54">been somebody it was loose and stupid</text>
  <text start="2588.26" dur="5.579">that did it we&amp;#39;ll be able to report back</text>
  <text start="2591.829" dur="5.27">and you&amp;#39;ll understand exactly what</text>
  <text start="2593.839" dur="4.591">happened but it was a very foolish move</text>
  <text start="2597.099" dur="4.74">all right</text>
  <text start="2598.43" dur="5.79">so talking again about the drone strike</text>
  <text start="2601.839" dur="4.631">are you saying it was it it was</text>
  <text start="2604.22" dur="4.53">intentional was it was it an accident</text>
  <text start="2606.47" dur="5.639">what what are you saying mr. president</text>
  <text start="2608.75" dur="6.48">what do you try to tell us about this</text>
  <text start="2612.109" dur="6.811">so Trump says basically yeah you know</text>
  <text start="2615.23" dur="6.27">what I think some idiot got a whole a</text>
  <text start="2618.92" dur="6.679">rogue actor again he&amp;#39;s talking about a</text>
  <text start="2621.5" dur="6.299">rogue actor someone who is not following</text>
  <text start="2625.599" dur="3.791">look that this is what I think is</text>
  <text start="2627.799" dur="3.891">happening and I have no way to prove</text>
  <text start="2629.39" dur="5.399">this and I have no inside sources I</text>
  <text start="2631.69" dur="5.109">suspect Trump is negotiating a peace</text>
  <text start="2634.789" dur="5.131">agreement he&amp;#39;s negotiating peace terms</text>
  <text start="2636.799" dur="6.691">of peace with Iran they&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="2639.92" dur="6.869">back-channel comes to broker a peace</text>
  <text start="2643.49" dur="6.99">agreement and some knucklehead in the</text>
  <text start="2646.789" dur="5.851">chain of command was either told by the</text>
  <text start="2650.48" dur="5.639">deep state or on his own initiative to</text>
  <text start="2652.64" dur="6.6">set it to launch a missile and that now</text>
  <text start="2656.119" dur="5.16">creates really bad optics for Trump and</text>
  <text start="2659.24" dur="4.559">he&amp;#39;s upset about this because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2661.279" dur="4.861">working on a peace plan and this throws</text>
  <text start="2663.799" dur="4.5">a little bit of a wrench in the plan if</text>
  <text start="2666.14" dur="3.899">for no other reason than he has to go</text>
  <text start="2668.299" dur="3.961">and talk to these idiots in the</text>
  <text start="2670.039" dur="6.211">mainstream media and tried to deflect</text>
  <text start="2672.26" dur="7.349">all of their suspicions and their their</text>
  <text start="2676.25" dur="5.369">hatred and of course people in the in</text>
  <text start="2679.609" dur="4.381">the new media who want to accuse Trump</text>
  <text start="2681.619" dur="4.5">of being a neocon and a war monger right</text>
  <text start="2683.99" dur="5.039">so this just creates all kinds of</text>
  <text start="2686.119" dur="4.44">optical issues he doesn&amp;#39;t want and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2689.029" dur="4.26">obviously a little bit frustrated over</text>
  <text start="2690.559" dur="4.56">it but he said we&amp;#39;re going to be able to</text>
  <text start="2693.289" dur="2.79">report back on it very soon and you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2695.119" dur="4.831">see what&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="2696.079" dur="6.21">so Trump is signaling to us again he</text>
  <text start="2699.95" dur="6.21">knows what&amp;#39;s going on he is in control</text>
  <text start="2702.289" dur="6.721">he&amp;#39;s talking with their leadership they</text>
  <text start="2706.16" dur="4.919">probably told Trump yes</text>
  <text start="2709.01" dur="4.2">this is some rogue actor in the chain of</text>
  <text start="2711.079" dur="4.351">command who popped off this missile</text>
  <text start="2713.21" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re gonna go out and execute this guy</text>
  <text start="2715.43" dur="4.98">or punish him or whatever they do to</text>
  <text start="2717.17" dur="5.52">those people I&amp;#39;m reasonably confident</text>
  <text start="2720.41" dur="4.08">that whoever was in charge of firing</text>
  <text start="2722.69" dur="4.02">that missile is not going to be firing</text>
  <text start="2724.49" dur="5.27">another missile I think Trump is is</text>
  <text start="2726.71" dur="8.1">seriously working toward a peace plan I</text>
  <text start="2729.76" dur="7.3">think that this was an unfortunate move</text>
  <text start="2734.81" dur="4.8">maybe by the deep state maybe John Kerry</text>
  <text start="2737.06" dur="6.29">and Obama right Kerry has been talking</text>
  <text start="2739.61" dur="7.92">to the Iranian leadership so John Kerry</text>
  <text start="2743.35" dur="7.57">did the shadow government Obama Kerry</text>
  <text start="2747.53" dur="5.46">all these people they&amp;#39;re still going</text>
  <text start="2750.92" dur="6.48">around behind trumps back to their</text>
  <text start="2752.99" dur="7.35">buddies in former leaders in Italy and</text>
  <text start="2757.4" dur="4.77">other places trying to convince those</text>
  <text start="2760.34" dur="4.35">people Trump is about is going to be</text>
  <text start="2762.17" dur="4.17">taken out and hang in there and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2764.69" dur="4.05">gonna get our deep state plans back on</text>
  <text start="2766.34" dur="3.27">track don&amp;#39;t give up the ship yet we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2768.74" dur="3.15">still working on it</text>
  <text start="2769.61" dur="3.6">right because the deep state is not</text>
  <text start="2771.89" dur="2.7">going to go down without a fight they</text>
  <text start="2773.21" dur="3.45">still have assets and they still have</text>
  <text start="2774.59" dur="5.87">people and rogue agents in many</text>
  <text start="2776.66" dur="9.12">different places so it&amp;#39;s possible that</text>
  <text start="2780.46" dur="8.05">Kerry has been working with a faction in</text>
  <text start="2785.78" dur="5.09">Iran that is sympathetic to what the</text>
  <text start="2788.51" dur="4.44">deep state wants to do and they may have</text>
  <text start="2790.87" dur="3.97">convinced someone in the chain of</text>

  <text start="2794.84" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t know I have I have no no factual</text>
  <text start="2796.7" dur="5.19">evidence to back that up it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2799.16" dur="7.02">possible why would carry be over there</text>
  <text start="2801.89" dur="5.94">talking to Iranian leaders obviously</text>
  <text start="2806.18" dur="5.94">because they want to put into effect</text>
  <text start="2807.83" dur="6.12">some kind of plan to thwart what Trump</text>
  <text start="2812.12" dur="4.38">is doing and Trump is trying to broker</text>
  <text start="2813.95" dur="4.56">peace what do they want they want war</text>
  <text start="2816.5" dur="4.77">they want Iran to continue building</text>
  <text start="2818.51" dur="4.83">nuclear weapons and eventually be able</text>
  <text start="2821.27" dur="4.35">to start World War three so they can get</text>
  <text start="2823.34" dur="4.83">rid of Russia they can get rid of United</text>
  <text start="2825.62" dur="3.9">States and they can get rid of all</text>
  <text start="2828.17" dur="3.15">international borders and have their big</text>
  <text start="2829.52" dur="4.5">happy world global government that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2831.32" dur="6">that&amp;#39;s the long-term plan of people like</text>
  <text start="2834.02" dur="4.95">Kerry and Obama they are trying to get</text>
  <text start="2837.32" dur="3.95">this done before they go to prison by</text>
  <text start="2838.97" dur="5.34">the way they are all going to prison</text>
  <text start="2841.27" dur="5.74">every single one of them is gonna go to</text>
  <text start="2844.31" dur="2.94">prison and if you think they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="2847.01" dur="4.71">be</text>
  <text start="2847.25" dur="6.869">to prison in a civilian setting I would</text>
  <text start="2851.72" dur="4.8">be willing to bet you a package of</text>
  <text start="2854.119" dur="5.431">cookies most of them are going to</text>
  <text start="2856.52" dur="4.79">military tribunals and a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="2859.55" dur="5.58">going to be facing the death penalty</text>
  <text start="2861.31" dur="6.82">because as Trump has repeatedly said</text>
  <text start="2865.13" dur="5.52">over and over and over and over again</text>
  <text start="2868.13" dur="7.14">this can never be allowed to happen</text>
  <text start="2870.65" dur="7.59">again how do you send a permanent</text>
  <text start="2875.27" dur="7.62">indelible message into the conscience of</text>
  <text start="2878.24" dur="7.379">the country how do you set up a warning</text>
  <text start="2882.89" dur="6.63">to potential politicians in the future</text>
  <text start="2885.619" dur="5.521">if you that if you think about becoming</text>
  <text start="2889.52" dur="3.51">a corrupt person if you think about</text>
  <text start="2891.14" dur="4.229">taking bribes if you think about working</text>
  <text start="2893.03" dur="4.23">with rogue elements in the deep state if</text>
  <text start="2895.369" dur="4.441">you think about betraying your oath to</text>
  <text start="2897.26" dur="5.339">office you just remember those people</text>
  <text start="2899.81" dur="4.44">who are publicly executed last year when</text>
  <text start="2902.599" dur="5.431">you think about taking a bribe or being</text>
  <text start="2904.25" dur="6.54">corrupt I honestly believe I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2908.03" dur="7.38">going to see public executions I think</text>
  <text start="2910.79" dur="8.1">there is no other way to send a signal</text>
  <text start="2915.41" dur="5.04">to corrupt people that you should never</text>
  <text start="2918.89" dur="4.44">ever try this again</text>
  <text start="2920.45" dur="4.98">I think the only way to do that is the</text>
  <text start="2923.33" dur="4.32">military is going to see oversee public</text>
  <text start="2925.43" dur="3.48">executions of some people they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2927.65" dur="5.01">to be public trials and there&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="2928.91" dur="5.37">public executions and it&amp;#39;s disgusting as</text>
  <text start="2932.66" dur="4.439">it sounds and it&amp;#39;s horrible as it sounds</text>
  <text start="2934.28" dur="5.28">and I am NOT about that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="2937.099" dur="6.631">I&amp;#39;m a mercy person I&amp;#39;m very much about</text>
  <text start="2939.56" dur="6.299">mercy I think when I hear Trump saying</text>
  <text start="2943.73" dur="2.639">this can never be allowed to happen</text>
  <text start="2945.859" dur="3.451">again</text>
  <text start="2946.369" dur="4.321">and I&amp;#39;m staying out of it I&amp;#39;m letting</text>
  <text start="2949.31" dur="3.65">our great Attorney General William Barr</text>
  <text start="2950.69" dur="5.25">take care take care of all this stuff</text>
  <text start="2952.96" dur="5.8">Trump has to remain out of the picture</text>
  <text start="2955.94" dur="7.95">as far as the prosecution end goes I</text>
  <text start="2958.76" dur="8.93">think that I don&amp;#39;t know that the DOJ has</text>
  <text start="2963.89" dur="7.08">the cojones to go ahead and actually</text>
  <text start="2967.69" dur="5.55">carry out the kind of justice that needs</text>
  <text start="2970.97" dur="4.47">to be carried out in these cases I</text>
  <text start="2973.24" dur="7.51">absolutely know the military will do it</text>
  <text start="2975.44" dur="8.78">and even though most people think</text>
  <text start="2980.75" dur="9.69">that the prosecution is being run by the</text>
  <text start="2984.22" dur="8.59">civilian DOJ I can I can guarantee you</text>
  <text start="2990.44" dur="4.14">the military is much more involved in</text>
  <text start="2992.81" dur="3.36">this process than anyone wants to think</text>
  <text start="2994.58" dur="3.03">about they&amp;#39;re not in the headlines</text>
  <text start="2996.17" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re not talking about it publicly</text>
  <text start="2997.61" dur="5.01">but I guarantee you the military is</text>
  <text start="3000.04" dur="3.78">preparing for what is going to come the</text>
  <text start="3002.62" dur="2.91">military knows they&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="3003.82" dur="5.57">take over a lot of the prosecution of</text>
  <text start="3005.53" dur="6.33">this q has put out the placeholders and</text>
  <text start="3009.39" dur="4.84">the placeholders have a lot to do with</text>
  <text start="3011.86" dur="5.49">military trials versus civilian trials</text>
  <text start="3014.23" dur="6.81">Supreme Court challenges regarding</text>
  <text start="3017.35" dur="5.19">military trials of civilians so Q has</text>
  <text start="3021.04" dur="4.53">already been signaling and I think Trump</text>
  <text start="3022.54" dur="5.1">has been signaling also that because</text>
  <text start="3025.57" dur="2.52">this can never be allowed to happen</text>
  <text start="3027.64" dur="3.14">again</text>
  <text start="3028.09" dur="5.91">because they have to put in place a</text>
  <text start="3030.78" dur="5.89">strong signal into the consciousness of</text>
  <text start="3034" dur="5.4">the world in our country that this can</text>
  <text start="3036.67" dur="5.19">never happen again the punishment is</text>
  <text start="3039.4" dur="4.59">going to be severe and people need a</text>
  <text start="3041.86" dur="5.28">permanent record they can look back at</text>
  <text start="3043.99" dur="5.34">those executions and go we do not want</text>
  <text start="3047.14" dur="4.88">to have that to happen to us so we&amp;#39;re</text>
