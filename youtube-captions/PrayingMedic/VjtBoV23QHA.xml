  <text start="68.95" dur="5.19">recommended to me by some friends who</text>
  <text start="72.28" dur="4.759">are seers I think I might have in might</text>

  <text start="87.099" dur="5.491">times</text>
  <text start="87.66" dur="6.28">yeah and then and what happened was it</text>
  <text start="92.59" dur="4.41">you know I&amp;#39;m very interested in saying</text>
  <text start="93.94" dur="4.59">in the spirit I teach on it Mike van</text>
  <text start="97" dur="4.8">Wyman teaches on it we&amp;#39;ve both written</text>
  <text start="98.53" dur="5.399">books on this subject and then you know</text>
  <text start="101.8" dur="5.81">I always recommend other people&amp;#39;s books</text>
  <text start="103.929" dur="6.121">if they&amp;#39;re good resources and then a</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="5.02">looks like about a year ago the book</text>
  <text start="110.05" dur="3.929">went out of print and I was very</text>
  <text start="112.63" dur="3.269">distraught because I had been</text>
  <text start="113.979" dur="3.901">recommending this book to so many people</text>
  <text start="115.899" dur="3.631">and then I&amp;#39;m like oh man you can only</text>
  <text start="117.88" dur="4.5">get it through secondary markets and</text>
  <text start="119.53" dur="4.979">it&amp;#39;s like 35 or 40 dollars and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="122.38" dur="3.78">available you know as a primary book</text>
  <text start="124.509" dur="3.871">through a publisher anymore and I was</text>
  <text start="126.16" dur="6.92">like that really sucks because this is a</text>
  <text start="128.38" dur="7.68">great book so then I got contacted by</text>
  <text start="133.08" dur="4.299">one of the gals I guess from your</text>
  <text start="136.06" dur="3.179">publishing company and said hey would</text>
  <text start="137.379" dur="3.931">you like to interview Blake he&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="139.239" dur="3.811">gonna be publishing his book reissuing</text>
  <text start="141.31" dur="3.77">it I was like are you kidding me that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.05" dur="5.4">awesome news I&amp;#39;m so excited</text>
  <text start="145.08" dur="5.38">so what&amp;#39;s the backstory there I&amp;#39;m on the</text>
  <text start="148.45" dur="4.26">book and the publishing just</text>
  <text start="150.46" dur="4.8">for people&amp;#39;s capacity yeah sure thing</text>
  <text start="152.71" dur="4.11">yeah so I originally published the veil</text>
  <text start="155.26" dur="6.21">not mistaken I think it was five years</text>
  <text start="156.82" dur="7.41">ago now which is crazy and so when I</text>
  <text start="161.47" dur="4.68">first was you know finishing the book I</text>
  <text start="164.23" dur="3.21">I mention in the book how I had</text>
  <text start="166.15" dur="2.88">rewritten the book three different times</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="4.05">and different styles and things like</text>
  <text start="169.03" dur="6.03">that and I finally settled on this style</text>
  <text start="171.49" dur="5.04">that that feel good to me it felt you</text>
  <text start="175.06" dur="2.85">know it was different I didn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="176.53" dur="3.72">have anything to compare to as far as</text>
  <text start="177.91" dur="4.49">the the structure and the style and you</text>
  <text start="180.25" dur="4.77">know wasn&amp;#39;t you know trying to be</text>
  <text start="182.4" dur="5.26">convincing or you know that that kind of</text>
  <text start="185.02" dur="6.96">traditional style of Christian book and</text>
  <text start="187.66" dur="5.73">so in that i am i was talking with</text>
  <text start="191.98" dur="2.85">different friends that had put books out</text>
  <text start="193.39" dur="4.2">before trying to get you know good</text>
  <text start="194.83" dur="5.61">advice about how to get the book out</text>
  <text start="197.59" dur="4.44">there and obviously unfortunately a lot</text>
  <text start="200.44" dur="4.14">of those stories that I heard sounded</text>
  <text start="202.03" dur="4.14">really rough you know he&amp;#39;s just really</text>
  <text start="204.58" dur="3.84">challenging you know really hard to get</text>
  <text start="206.17" dur="4.47">in the door and then when you&amp;#39;d get in</text>
  <text start="208.42" dur="3.72">the door with someone it would be you&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="210.64" dur="4.23">have to really put a lot of a large</text>
  <text start="212.14" dur="4.77">financial investment upfront and we had</text>
  <text start="214.87" dur="3.54">just had our first kid and we&amp;#39;re making</text>
  <text start="216.91" dur="2.79">tons of money and so you know that all</text>
  <text start="218.41" dur="2.94">that stuff was just a little bit</text>
  <text start="219.7" dur="3.09">nerve-wracking him it was right around</text>
  <text start="221.35" dur="3.63">then I discovered that there was some</text>
  <text start="222.79" dur="3.78">really good self-publishing options just</text>
  <text start="224.98" dur="3.87">through through three Amazon different</text>
  <text start="226.57" dur="4.17">companies like that and up until that</text>
  <text start="228.85" dur="3.12">point I would always heard that was that</text>
  <text start="230.74" dur="2.82">was a bad way to do it you end up with</text>
  <text start="231.97" dur="2.88">the garage full of books and you know</text>
  <text start="233.56" dur="3.81">spending all this money and all that and</text>
  <text start="234.85" dur="3.96">but these relatively new platforms had</text>
  <text start="237.37" dur="4.56">come together and so I published the</text>
  <text start="238.81" dur="5.52">book independently through those and did</text>
  <text start="241.93" dur="3.36">it was doing pretty pretty well with you</text>
  <text start="244.33" dur="3.15">know I got I don&amp;#39;t really have much of a</text>
  <text start="245.29" dur="5">gauge but it was doing well and then</text>
  <text start="247.48" dur="6.09">after just relatively recently I had a</text>
  <text start="250.29" dur="6.19">publisher contact me wanting to know if</text>
  <text start="253.57" dur="5.19">they want if I wanted to republish the</text>
  <text start="256.48" dur="5.069">book with them you know put it put a few</text>
  <text start="258.76" dur="3.99">little updates into it you know also you</text>
  <text start="261.549" dur="4.891">know sign with them to do a couple more</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="5.91">books and just kind of try to book to a</text>
  <text start="266.44" dur="3.9">wider audience just because I honestly</text>
  <text start="268.66" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m not the best business person in the</text>
  <text start="270.34" dur="3.99">world so I hadn&amp;#39;t really been pushing</text>
  <text start="272.26" dur="4.32">the book much on my own just kind of you</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="5.37">know it was getting out there on its own</text>
  <text start="276.58" dur="4.44">and so yeah I ended up signing with them</text>
  <text start="279.7" dur="2.88">because they had to really you know</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="3.21">they&amp;#39;ve been they brought to me the the</text>
  <text start="282.58" dur="3.51">whole structure of their company</text>
  <text start="284.23" dur="4.11">really liked what their heart was with</text>
  <text start="286.09" dur="3.63">you know wanting to get get these kinds</text>
  <text start="288.34" dur="2.79">of messages out there they really</text>
  <text start="289.72" dur="3.83">understood the book as well because that</text>
  <text start="291.13" dur="4.86">was another concern was that people</text>
  <text start="293.55" dur="3.85">would really want me to change the style</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="3.96">and you know I was definitely open to</text>
  <text start="297.4" dur="4.53">feedback but some of the core ways that</text>
  <text start="299.95" dur="4.62">I decided to approach this is a book I</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="3.99">didn&amp;#39;t really want change and they were</text>
  <text start="304.57" dur="3.48">really understanding of that really</text>
  <text start="305.92" dur="3.66">understanding of even some little things</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="3.84">about this the way I&amp;#39;d like to design</text>
  <text start="309.58" dur="3.72">certain things and so yeah they updated</text>
  <text start="311.89" dur="3.12">the cover a little bit ahead and had</text>
  <text start="313.3" dur="3.39">some good feedback about just some some</text>
  <text start="315.01" dur="3">relatively minor additions to kind of</text>
  <text start="316.69" dur="3.66">fill the book out just a little bit more</text>
  <text start="318.01" dur="5.07">and an unfortunate I did have to take</text>
  <text start="320.35" dur="4.77">the book down just in the manufacturing</text>
  <text start="323.08" dur="4.41">process kind of agreed on a certain time</text>
  <text start="325.12" dur="4.53">that I would take the book down so that</text>
  <text start="327.49" dur="4.71">they could kind of ramp up their their</text>
  <text start="329.65" dur="4.56">side of things and I remember looking</text>
  <text start="332.2" dur="3.3">online consumers used copies going for</text>
  <text start="334.21" dur="9.68">thirty and forty dollars my god no</text>
  <text start="335.5" dur="10.41">please don&amp;#39;t yeah well you know here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="343.89" dur="3.79">something on it you probably don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="345.91" dur="5.16">about but I have a lot of friends who</text>
  <text start="347.68" dur="5.67">are authors I just got connected to a</text>

  <text start="358.69" dur="6.53">authors some of them are self-published</text>

  <text start="365.22" dur="6.76">for aspiring authors different routes</text>
  <text start="369.28" dur="4.59">and options for publishing so that story</text>
  <text start="371.98" dur="4.05">to me is very interesting I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="373.87" dur="4.89">self-published I&amp;#39;m pretty much an Amazon</text>

  <text start="584.36" dur="5.07">and demonic devices and different things</text>
  <text start="586.55" dur="5.46">I had heard some testimonies from people</text>
  <text start="589.43" dur="5.04">I had experienced some things myself but</text>
  <text start="592.01" dur="4.769">when I read your book your book gave me</text>
  <text start="594.47" dur="4.77">confirmation after confirmation of</text>
  <text start="596.779" dur="4.68">things that I suspected things that I</text>
  <text start="599.24" dur="4.62">thought were true I was just right down</text>
  <text start="601.459" dur="5.641">the line like yes yes I knew it I knew</text>
  <text start="603.86" dur="8.4">it so your book was just really good</text>
  <text start="607.1" dur="6.51">confirmation for me now I I don&amp;#39;t I mean</text>
  <text start="612.26" dur="3.75">when I was reading your book I was like</text>
  <text start="613.61" dur="6.9">dude this guy has seen in the spirit</text>
  <text start="616.01" dur="8.069">since he was like a little kid and you</text>
  <text start="620.51" dur="6.48">did not know that that was not normal no</text>
  <text start="624.079" dur="5.191">yeah it was pretty much from that you</text>
  <text start="626.99" dur="4.2">know I even this was my first memories</text>
  <text start="629.27" dur="3.45">involve seeing the spirits I&amp;#39;ve always</text>
  <text start="631.19" dur="3.69">seen that ever since I was a little kid</text>
  <text start="632.72" dur="3.84">well yeah you know it was one of those</text>
  <text start="634.88" dur="4.649">things were up until I was 12 years old</text>
  <text start="636.56" dur="4.41">I didn&amp;#39;t really have a great part of it</text>
  <text start="639.529" dur="3.81">was we weren&amp;#39;t going to any churches or</text>
  <text start="640.97" dur="4.32">anything that had that had a grid for</text>
  <text start="643.339" dur="4.44">that kind of thing even being possible</text>
  <text start="645.29" dur="5.1">and so I you know when I was little</text>
  <text start="647.779" dur="4.741">little it um you know just kind of</text>
  <text start="650.39" dur="4.41">blended in with everything else and you</text>
  <text start="652.52" dur="3.75">know to me it wasn&amp;#39;t any more unusual</text>
  <text start="654.8" dur="4.05">than any of the other things that I</text>
  <text start="656.27" dur="4.92">would see me as you know as far as just</text>
  <text start="658.85" dur="3.66">like normal life stuff and so and you</text>
  <text start="661.19" dur="2.76">know I think my parents were kind of</text>
  <text start="662.51" dur="3.15">mutually ignorant in the sense that they</text>
  <text start="663.95" dur="3.78">you know kids say funny things all the</text>
  <text start="665.66" dur="4.5">time and so if I would talk about you</text>
  <text start="667.73" dur="4.32">know golden ladies dancing you know down</text>
  <text start="670.16" dur="3.84">the hallway or a giant flying dog that I</text>
  <text start="672.05" dur="4.68">saw you know that was not you know too</text>
  <text start="674" dur="4.079">outside the norm and then by the time I</text>
  <text start="676.73" dur="4.13">started getting a little bit older and</text>
  <text start="678.079" dur="5.641">started getting a little bit more</text>
  <text start="680.86" dur="3.38">feedback not not in a direct sense but</text>
  <text start="683.72" dur="1.899">like you know</text>
  <text start="684.24" dur="3">and small things like that making weird</text>
  <text start="685.619" dur="4.08">faces if I you know talked about</text>
  <text start="687.24" dur="3.689">something weird I you know in retrospect</text>
  <text start="689.699" dur="5.341">I&amp;#39;m it&amp;#39;s kind of shocking how quickly</text>
  <text start="690.929" dur="5.94">and easily it became to just not talk</text>
  <text start="695.04" dur="3.839">about that stuff just because if not</text>
  <text start="696.869" dur="3.241">enough on the strong way or a harsh way</text>
  <text start="698.879" dur="3.721">but it just didn&amp;#39;t get a positive</text>
  <text start="700.11" dur="4.11">reaction well because you&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="702.6" dur="4.169">about experiences other people are not</text>
  <text start="704.22" dur="5.429">having right and what what you talk</text>
  <text start="706.769" dur="4.651">about is borderlines on for most people</text>
  <text start="709.649" dur="3.091">okay so you&amp;#39;re basically hallucinating</text>
  <text start="711.42" dur="4.139">you&amp;#39;re seeing things that nobody else</text>
  <text start="712.74" dur="4.409">sees sure and you get a few strange</text>
  <text start="715.559" dur="6">looks and pretty soon you&amp;#39;re like okay</text>
  <text start="717.149" dur="5.97">maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t talk about the</text>
  <text start="721.559" dur="2.97">thought process because I I was a</text>
  <text start="723.119" dur="4.26">missionary kid growing up so I moved</text>
  <text start="724.529" dur="5.42">around a lot and we&amp;#39;re you know in</text>
  <text start="727.379" dur="6.601">different parts in you know Europe and</text>
  <text start="729.949" dur="5.08">Western Eastern Europe and so we I was</text>
  <text start="733.98" dur="4.049">around a lot of kids who didn&amp;#39;t speak</text>
  <text start="735.029" dur="4.141">English and even the other missionary</text>
  <text start="738.029" dur="4.59">kids that I was with there&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="739.17" dur="5.099">small group of people and so I some of</text>
  <text start="742.619" dur="2.88">it may have been just the you know again</text>
  <text start="744.269" dur="2.581">I&amp;#39;m not around a lot of people who speak</text>
  <text start="745.499" dur="4.08">English so I&amp;#39;m not getting that feedback</text>
  <text start="746.85" dur="4.38">early and young and I remember we moved</text>
  <text start="749.579" dur="3.23">back to the US when I was nine years old</text>
  <text start="751.23" dur="3.81">and that&amp;#39;s the first time I remember</text>
  <text start="752.809" dur="4.15">getting some of those weird looks and I</text>
  <text start="755.04" dur="4.019">remember thinking of it literally as you</text>
  <text start="756.959" dur="3.54">know okay well you know I&amp;#39;m used to</text>
  <text start="759.059" dur="4.981">moving around in different countries and</text>
  <text start="760.499" dur="5.13">used to learning that oh it&amp;#39;s no perfect</text>
  <text start="764.04" dur="3.539">way to do this in this country but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="765.629" dur="3.51">considered very impolite in this country</text>
  <text start="767.579" dur="3.63">and so just learning different customs</text>
  <text start="769.139" dur="3.75">and things like that and so since I was</text>
  <text start="771.209" dur="3.6">moving to a new town in a new place I</text>
  <text start="772.889" dur="4.88">thought oh I guess it&amp;#39;s just impolite to</text>
  <text start="774.809" dur="5.161">talk about the golden people you know</text>
  <text start="777.769" dur="3.61">literally thinking that I oh I guess</text>
  <text start="779.97" dur="3.209">they just don&amp;#39;t talk about that and you</text>
  <text start="781.379" dur="4.531">know since those used to attack date I</text>
  <text start="783.179" dur="5.21">just kind of it was you know it became</text>
  <text start="785.91" dur="6.779">easy to adapt around that and that way</text>
  <text start="788.389" dur="6.79">and for you and and this you know</text>
  <text start="792.689" dur="4.471">unfortunately for some people who have</text>
  <text start="795.179" dur="5.16">tried to read your book and I need to</text>
  <text start="797.16" dur="5.31">say this I I have recommended your book</text>
  <text start="800.339" dur="4.891">to a lot of people over the years and I</text>
  <text start="802.47" dur="4.89">have had some pushback from people who</text>
  <text start="805.23" dur="3.24">said I tried to read that book and I</text>
  <text start="807.36" dur="3.899">couldn&amp;#39;t get through the first four</text>
  <text start="808.47" dur="4.229">chapters it terrified me yeah and I was</text>
  <text start="811.259" dur="3.63">like yeah well you know what you have to</text>
  <text start="812.699" dur="4.211">get past page 80 and once you get past</text>
  <text start="814.889" dur="4.391">page 80 then everything kind of</text>
  <text start="816.91" dur="4.08">is a whole lot better and they&amp;#39;re like I</text>
  <text start="819.28" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t know if I could do it is just you</text>
  <text start="820.99" dur="5.52">know this poor kid being tormented by</text>
  <text start="822.64" dur="5.94">demons every night like yeah well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="826.51" dur="3.84">part of the story but you have to get</text>
  <text start="828.58" dur="3.84">past that because there&amp;#39;s good stuff</text>
  <text start="830.35" dur="5.67">after that totally yeah I&amp;#39;ve struggled</text>
  <text start="832.42" dur="6.78">so hard how much of that to put in where</text>
  <text start="836.02" dur="5.4">to put that in and I I can&amp;#39;t tell you</text>
  <text start="839.2" dur="3.78">that that part got revived more than</text>
  <text start="841.42" dur="5.46">just about anything else just because I</text>
  <text start="842.98" dur="7.41">I knew I had to talk about it I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="846.88" dur="5.58">want to pull any punches because I you</text>
  <text start="850.39" dur="4.11">know you soften it too much and you kind</text>
  <text start="852.46" dur="5.88">of you lose the the testimony you know</text>
  <text start="854.5" dur="4.38">of the whole thing but also I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="858.34" dur="2.55">want to you know</text>
  <text start="858.88" dur="3.81">scare people away from the book and so</text>
  <text start="860.89" dur="3.54">yeah that&amp;#39;s what put a lot of thought</text>
  <text start="862.69" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m working tonight even to this day I</text>
  <text start="864.43" dur="5.64">don&amp;#39;t know you know I still wonder like</text>
  <text start="866.53" dur="6.21">should I have shorten that up no I think</text>
  <text start="870.07" dur="5.82">I think it was really good it was a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="872.74" dur="5.73">a very compelling you know everybody has</text>
  <text start="875.89" dur="6.03">a different writing style I&amp;#39;m more of a</text>
  <text start="878.47" dur="4.89">storyteller I do teaching and I do</text>
  <text start="881.92" dur="3.48">storytelling I have some books that are</text>
  <text start="883.36" dur="3.72">just me telling stories of you know</text>
  <text start="885.4" dur="3.75">people I&amp;#39;ve seen healed and the</text>
  <text start="887.08" dur="3.84">ambulance things like that and then I</text>
  <text start="889.15" dur="3.93">have some straightforward teaching books</text>
  <text start="890.92" dur="5.4">here&amp;#39;s you know a bunch of Scripture</text>
  <text start="893.08" dur="5.85">here are some misconceptions here are my</text>
  <text start="896.32" dur="4.08">own experiences you know here&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="898.93" dur="3.39">things that you can try and do some</text>
  <text start="900.4" dur="4.32">exercises kind of you know</text>
  <text start="902.32" dur="4.53">straightforward teaching your book the</text>
  <text start="904.72" dur="4.86">way you approach it is very different</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="5.04">from any other book that I&amp;#39;ve read on</text>
  <text start="909.58" dur="4.35">the subject of seeing in spirit because</text>
  <text start="911.89" dur="3.78">you know Mike van Valen and me we and</text>
  <text start="913.93" dur="4.17">and other people who have written on the</text>
  <text start="915.67" dur="4.83">subject tend to be teachers you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="918.1" dur="6.75">good teacher but your book is just</text>
  <text start="920.5" dur="7.56">straightforward almost like a diary yeah</text>
  <text start="924.85" dur="8.42">and I really appreciate that writing</text>
  <text start="928.06" dur="7.77">style because you know the thing is</text>
  <text start="933.27" dur="4.57">there&amp;#39;s plenty of people out there in</text>
  <text start="935.83" dur="5.04">the world who are writing teaching books</text>
  <text start="937.84" dur="4.98">on seeing in the spirit and when I have</text>
  <text start="940.87" dur="4.53">to admit when I first read your book I</text>
  <text start="942.82" dur="3.93">was like okay this is interesting but it</text>
  <text start="945.4" dur="3.93">doesn&amp;#39;t actually it doesn&amp;#39;t actually</text>
  <text start="946.75" dur="3.67">give you practical steps instruction</text>
  <text start="949.33" dur="4.36">teaching exercise</text>
  <text start="950.42" dur="3.87">well the Lord showed me he&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="953.69" dur="2.64">your job</text>
  <text start="954.29" dur="4.71">Blake has a different assignment Blake</text>
  <text start="956.33" dur="4.95">is going to just explain without a whole</text>
  <text start="959" dur="4.11">lot of teaching what this experience</text>
  <text start="961.28" dur="4.86">looks like feels like you know the</text>
  <text start="963.11" dur="4.59">emotional impact of it and you guys can</text>
  <text start="966.14" dur="4.89">do the teaching and the exercises and</text>
  <text start="967.7" dur="5.31">all the other stuff so your your book</text>
  <text start="971.03" dur="4.56">even though it is very different from</text>
  <text start="973.01" dur="6">most books on the subject I think you</text>
  <text start="975.59" dur="6.18">have a unique perspective that you know</text>
  <text start="979.01" dur="5.37">I have like I said I recommended this</text>
  <text start="981.77" dur="4.23">book to thousands of people and anyone</text>
  <text start="984.38" dur="4.79">who&amp;#39;s finished the book has come back to</text>
  <text start="986" dur="7.82">me and said wow that was amazing</text>
  <text start="989.17" dur="9.34">because you show you show the potential</text>
  <text start="993.82" dur="8.77">that that people can reach if they&amp;#39;re so</text>
  <text start="998.51" dur="5.45">inclined to do it see my book and other</text>
  <text start="1002.59" dur="4.29">people who have written on the subject</text>
  <text start="1003.96" dur="5.89">we you know we&amp;#39;re better at teaching</text>
  <text start="1006.88" dur="4.44">what&amp;#39;s you know these are some things</text>
  <text start="1009.85" dur="4.08">you can try to do there&amp;#39;s some scripture</text>
  <text start="1011.32" dur="5.7">here&amp;#39;s some my experiences your book is</text>
  <text start="1013.93" dur="5.97">like you&amp;#39;re a forerunner that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="1017.02" dur="4.53">would say you&amp;#39;re a forerunner and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1019.9" dur="3.18">kind of in the sense that you know Ian</text>
  <text start="1021.55" dur="3.779">Clayton is a forerunner and some certain</text>
  <text start="1023.08" dur="4.23">things and David Hogan is a forerunner</text>
  <text start="1025.329" dur="4.591">and Heidi Baker is a forerunner you know</text>
  <text start="1027.31" dur="5.57">raising the debt these people are</text>
  <text start="1029.92" dur="6">foreigners in the sense that they have</text>
  <text start="1032.88" dur="4.93">shown going as far as you can with this</text>
  <text start="1035.92" dur="5.46">and they&amp;#39;ve shown us the rest of us</text>
  <text start="1037.81" dur="4.95">what&amp;#39;s possible your book is that kind</text>
  <text start="1041.38" dur="3.69">of book for staying in the spirit this</text>
  <text start="1042.76" dur="6.54">is what&amp;#39;s possible if you apply yourself</text>
  <text start="1045.07" dur="7.74">if you engage if you really want to see</text>
  <text start="1049.3" dur="6.63">this stuff here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s possible so in</text>
  <text start="1052.81" dur="5.07">that sense it is a very valuable book at</text>
  <text start="1055.93" dur="4.62">least you know from my perspective I</text>
  <text start="1057.88" dur="5.73">appreciate that so I have a question for</text>
  <text start="1060.55" dur="7.02">you mm-hmm do you believe that anyone</text>
  <text start="1063.61" dur="5.58">can see in the spirit I do I do I it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1067.57" dur="5.28">interesting I think I may have mentioned</text>
  <text start="1069.19" dur="5.46">this in the book but I as soon as I</text>
  <text start="1072.85" dur="4.8">discovered that what I had was a gift</text>
  <text start="1074.65" dur="5.61">when I was 12 years old and the very</text>
  <text start="1077.65" dur="5.01">minute even the very the very first my</text>
  <text start="1080.26" dur="4.14">first few thoughts around understanding</text>
  <text start="1082.66" dur="3.66">that this was a gift I</text>
  <text start="1084.4" dur="3.81">was just immediately and completely</text>
  <text start="1086.32" dur="3.27">convinced but it was something that was</text>
  <text start="1088.21" dur="3.87">needed to be available for every</text>
  <text start="1089.59" dur="3.96">Christian and you know at the time I</text>
  <text start="1092.08" dur="2.97">couldn&amp;#39;t have given you a good</text>
  <text start="1093.55" dur="3.81">theological reason why it was really</text>
  <text start="1095.05" dur="4.53">just a gut feeling but it&amp;#39;s one that</text>
  <text start="1097.36" dur="3.99">I&amp;#39;ve had since since the moment one of</text>
  <text start="1099.58" dur="6.27">understanding what was going on with me</text>
  <text start="1101.35" dur="8.37">and you know I the way that I look at it</text>
  <text start="1105.85" dur="5.94">is you know the whole forerunner concept</text>
  <text start="1109.72" dur="4.2">which is one that I do like is that</text>
  <text start="1111.79" dur="4.74">there are people who are naturally</text>
  <text start="1113.92" dur="4.14">gifted in something that even even the</text>
  <text start="1116.53" dur="3.24">some of the sense maybe didn&amp;#39;t earn I</text>
  <text start="1118.06" dur="4.62">certainly didn&amp;#39;t earn this gift in any</text>
  <text start="1119.77" dur="7.71">way I received it before I couldn&amp;#39;t earn</text>
  <text start="1122.68" dur="7.32">it in any way but I I do think you know</text>
  <text start="1127.48" dur="4.47">forerunners are exist to show us what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1130" dur="5.7">possible to show us what&amp;#39;s available to</text>
  <text start="1131.95" dur="5.85">show us what what God has for us and so</text>
  <text start="1135.7" dur="5.01">I do believe that it is meant to be</text>
  <text start="1137.8" dur="4.68">available for everyone you know I I do I</text>
  <text start="1140.71" dur="4.29">think it&amp;#39;s the most important gift that</text>
  <text start="1142.48" dur="4.77">every single person should have no not</text>
  <text start="1145" dur="4.77">really I think it is one of a myriad of</text>
  <text start="1147.25" dur="3.18">ways to interact with God to get to know</text>
  <text start="1149.77" dur="4.02">God better</text>
  <text start="1150.43" dur="6.68">um but I do believe that anyone can</text>
  <text start="1153.79" dur="5.73">learn how to how to see in the spirit</text>
  <text start="1157.11" dur="5.26">I&amp;#39;m going to disagree with you</text>
  <text start="1159.52" dur="5.79">respectfully Donna please do and and</text>
  <text start="1162.37" dur="5.54">I&amp;#39;ll explain why and you&amp;#39;ll I think</text>
  <text start="1165.31" dur="6.51">you&amp;#39;ll jive with what I&amp;#39;m saying sure</text>
  <text start="1167.91" dur="7.84">the reason why I wrote my book on seeing</text>
  <text start="1171.82" dur="6.3">in the spirit is because I had read a</text>
  <text start="1175.75" dur="5.07">lot of other books by you know James</text>
  <text start="1178.12" dur="5.07">gall and Kevin biscotti and I think</text>
  <text start="1180.82" dur="4.89">Welton had his book out by then and a</text>
  <text start="1183.19" dur="5.85">lot of other people and every single</text>
  <text start="1185.71" dur="4.92">person that I read on the subject spoke</text>
  <text start="1189.04" dur="2.1">about seeing in the spirit as if it was</text>
  <text start="1190.63" dur="3.93">a gift</text>
  <text start="1191.14" dur="5.73">mm-hmm and the Lord has given me a</text>
  <text start="1194.56" dur="5.07">different perspective on it he has told</text>
  <text start="1196.87" dur="6.06">me he&amp;#39;s shown me this is not actually a</text>
  <text start="1199.63" dur="7.22">gift it is an innate ability everyone</text>
  <text start="1202.93" dur="6.87">has mm we perceive it to be a gift</text>
  <text start="1206.85" dur="5.62">because some people have developed it or</text>
  <text start="1209.8" dur="6.81">some people are given an advanced stage</text>
  <text start="1212.47" dur="6.27">of development and culture looks at them</text>
  <text start="1216.61" dur="4.5">as unusual and weird and they</text>
  <text start="1218.74" dur="4.5">oh you have a gift that I don&amp;#39;t have but</text>
  <text start="1221.11" dur="4.23">what the Lord has shown me is look you</text>
  <text start="1223.24" dur="4.95">have a spirit and your spirit has eyes</text>
  <text start="1225.34" dur="5.339">and your spirit has ears and your spirit</text>
  <text start="1228.19" dur="6.06">has all the senses that your physical</text>
  <text start="1230.679" dur="7.111">body has so it&amp;#39;s not like people aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1234.25" dur="6.33">born with spiritual eyes or spiritual</text>
  <text start="1237.79" dur="6.63">ears they are they just have to learn</text>
  <text start="1240.58" dur="7.38">how to develop the ability to perceive</text>
  <text start="1244.42" dur="7.23">what their spirit is sing and I liken it</text>
  <text start="1247.96" dur="7.92">to how a child learns to walk some</text>
  <text start="1251.65" dur="7.38">children develop the ability to walk</text>
  <text start="1255.88" dur="5.13">sooner than others I have seen children</text>
  <text start="1259.03" dur="4.88">that were able to walk at the age of six</text>
  <text start="1261.01" dur="6.6">or seven months which is highly unusual</text>
  <text start="1263.91" dur="6.54">but if you&amp;#39;re you know 11 year old 11</text>
  <text start="1267.61" dur="5.61">month old child and you can&amp;#39;t walk you</text>
  <text start="1270.45" dur="4.87">don&amp;#39;t look at a six month old child who</text>
  <text start="1273.22" dur="5.7">can walk and go oh they have a gift that</text>
  <text start="1275.32" dur="6.39">I don&amp;#39;t have right they have an ability</text>
  <text start="1278.92" dur="6.9">that everyone has they&amp;#39;ve just developed</text>
  <text start="1281.71" dur="4.62">it sooner and more fully than other</text>
  <text start="1285.82" dur="2.21">people</text>
  <text start="1286.33" dur="3.51">same thing with piano or playing guitar</text>
  <text start="1288.03" dur="4.36">anyone can learn how to play piano</text>
  <text start="1289.84" dur="3.96">anyone can learn how to play guitar some</text>
  <text start="1292.39" dur="4.86">people seem to be a bit more musically</text>
  <text start="1293.8" dur="5.43">inclined but if you if you practice and</text>
  <text start="1297.25" dur="4.08">practice and practice you&amp;#39;ll develop</text>
  <text start="1299.23" dur="3.48">that ability and if you get really good</text>
  <text start="1301.33" dur="3.57">at it some people will say oh you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1302.71" dur="4.26">really gifted and you might say well no</text>
  <text start="1304.9" dur="5.029">I actually I&amp;#39;m not that gifted I just</text>
  <text start="1306.97" dur="5.25">practice a lot that I develop my ability</text>
  <text start="1309.929" dur="6.011">what I what I have learned because I</text>
  <text start="1312.22" dur="7.709">never saw visions until I was 48 years</text>
  <text start="1315.94" dur="6.06">old or 46 mm-hmm I had never seen</text>
  <text start="1319.929" dur="5.461">visions never seen I never even had</text>
  <text start="1322" dur="6.03">really dreams until from I had dreams</text>
  <text start="1325.39" dur="4.74">when I was a teenager and then at the</text>
  <text start="1328.03" dur="4.74">age of about 21 I stopped having dreams</text>
  <text start="1330.13" dur="4.02">and I don&amp;#39;t mean like I didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="1332.77" dur="3.57">dreams I had dreams and I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1334.15" dur="4.56">remember them and I did not have dreams</text>
  <text start="1336.34" dur="5.37">period I just didn&amp;#39;t have for like 25</text>
  <text start="1338.71" dur="7.26">years no dreams never saw visions never</text>
  <text start="1341.71" dur="7.38">saw anything supernatural 2008 I had my</text>
  <text start="1345.97" dur="4.44">first dream in like 25 years and from</text>
  <text start="1349.09" dur="2.64">that point on I&amp;#39;ve been dreaming like</text>
  <text start="1350.41" dur="4.35">crazy and</text>
  <text start="1351.73" dur="6.12">I learned how to see in the spirit I</text>
  <text start="1354.76" dur="5.58">learned how to see visions and the Lord</text>
  <text start="1357.85" dur="5.73">took me through a training process where</text>
  <text start="1360.34" dur="7.83">I had to just sit alone quietly meditate</text>
  <text start="1363.58" dur="6.21">and train my mind to focus on what my</text>
  <text start="1368.17" dur="5.37">spirit was saying instead of what my</text>
  <text start="1369.79" dur="6.6">natural eyes were seeing and so for me</text>
  <text start="1373.54" dur="5.79">my perspective is because I was not born</text>
  <text start="1376.39" dur="4.47">that way I didn&amp;#39;t have it I&amp;#39;ve never</text>
  <text start="1379.33" dur="2.91">really been I mean I have a lot of</text>
  <text start="1380.86" dur="3.57">friends who were like oh yeah I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1382.24" dur="4.74">seeing angels and demons since I was you</text>
  <text start="1384.43" dur="5.69">know 3 or 4 years old boy yeah well you</text>
  <text start="1386.98" dur="6.21">had about 40 years of experience on me</text>
  <text start="1390.12" dur="8.11">my my development has been much</text>
  <text start="1393.19" dur="7.74">different and I that it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1398.23" dur="4.47">actually an ability we all have but a</text>
  <text start="1400.93" dur="3.93">lot of people just never get around to</text>
  <text start="1402.7" dur="6.39">developing it and I think I think people</text>
  <text start="1404.86" dur="7.83">like you are given an advanced stage of</text>
  <text start="1409.09" dur="5.73">development by God so that you can be a</text>
  <text start="1412.69" dur="5.01">forerunner so that you can show the rest</text>
  <text start="1414.82" dur="5.46">of us idiots what&amp;#39;s possible like you</text>
  <text start="1417.7" dur="4.98">know this guy&amp;#39;s got something you have</text>
  <text start="1420.28" dur="4.26">you just need to develop it and exercise</text>
  <text start="1422.68" dur="6.09">and you&amp;#39;ll that you can go to where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1424.54" dur="7.29">at right now so anyway that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="1428.77" dur="6.6">I explain it yeah I definitely see it</text>
  <text start="1431.83" dur="5.13">that way for sure you know it&amp;#39;s I even</text>
  <text start="1435.37" dur="7.41">as I mentioned you know with with myself</text>
  <text start="1436.96" dur="6.81">like even some of what I eat you know</text>
  <text start="1442.78" dur="2.52">some one of the things I think you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1443.77" dur="3.84">been contributed to me continuing to</text>
  <text start="1445.3" dur="4.29">seeing the spirit was that I was not</text>
  <text start="1447.61" dur="5.88">around other American kids very much</text>
  <text start="1449.59" dur="8.01">edit I kind of you know 5 years old 2 to</text>
  <text start="1453.49" dur="5.97">9 and 10 years old and I almost in some</text>
  <text start="1457.6" dur="3.57">ways got because one of the things I</text>
  <text start="1459.46" dur="4.11">have noticed with especially with other</text>
  <text start="1461.17" dur="6.21">kids when I&amp;#39;m teaching especially kids</text>
  <text start="1463.57" dur="5.73">to see them experience is I think just</text>
  <text start="1467.38" dur="4.32">about every kid season the spirit but we</text>
  <text start="1469.3" dur="4.38">again whether it&amp;#39;s socially whatever it</text>
  <text start="1471.7" dur="4.56">is we learn not to where we learn not to</text>
  <text start="1473.68" dur="2.91">focus on that or we learn right you shut</text>
  <text start="1476.26" dur="2.55">it down</text>
  <text start="1476.59" dur="4.59">but it now now because parents tell you</text>
  <text start="1478.81" dur="6.43">oh that&amp;#39;s just your imagination right</text>
  <text start="1481.18" dur="6.12">now and if if revelation from the</text>
  <text start="1485.24" dur="4.53">supernatural world comes into your mind</text>
  <text start="1487.3" dur="4.45">you know through what some people would</text>
  <text start="1489.77" dur="7.02">call your imagination but I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1491.75" dur="7.98">that&amp;#39;s a bad name you know when you see</text>
  <text start="1496.79" dur="5.28">things other people don&amp;#39;t see you either</text>
  <text start="1499.73" dur="4.35">call it hallucinating or you say oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1502.07" dur="3.45">just your imagination or you if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1504.08" dur="3.12">hip to it you go oh you&amp;#39;re seeing</text>
  <text start="1505.52" dur="4.5">visions you&amp;#39;re seeing in the spirit and</text>
  <text start="1507.2" dur="4.95">and if adults are not seeing the things</text>
  <text start="1510.02" dur="4.17">you&amp;#39;re seeing obviously it&amp;#39;s like yeah</text>
  <text start="1512.15" dur="5.25">well that&amp;#39;s just your imagination you</text>
  <text start="1514.19" dur="4.8">learn kids are cultural they&amp;#39;re their</text>
  <text start="1517.4" dur="3.39">culture alized and they&amp;#39;re normalized to</text>
  <text start="1518.99" dur="6">shut down their imagination to shut down</text>
  <text start="1520.79" dur="6.18">their spiritual senses I have you know</text>
  <text start="1524.99" dur="3.93">talked to a lot of people who have kids</text>
  <text start="1526.97" dur="4.23">have snick communicate with angels they</text>
  <text start="1528.92" dur="4.77">see angels they you know communicate</text>
  <text start="1531.2" dur="6.12">with them mm-hmm and the parents have</text>
  <text start="1533.69" dur="5.4">wisely decided not to shut it down not</text>
  <text start="1537.32" dur="4.07">to discourage them because they&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1539.09" dur="6.21">what happens when you discourage kids</text>
  <text start="1541.39" dur="6.37">from engaging the supernatural later on</text>
  <text start="1545.3" dur="4.55">when they want to actually use that you</text>
  <text start="1547.76" dur="7.82">have to go back and reopen the gates and</text>
  <text start="1549.85" dur="10.48">repent of some wrong thinking certainly</text>
  <text start="1555.58" dur="6.43">so let me ask you this I you know</text>
  <text start="1560.33" dur="6.05">everybody wants to be able to see angels</text>
  <text start="1562.01" dur="8.22">mm-hmm what advice do you have for</text>
  <text start="1566.38" dur="7.21">people who are not seeing in the spirit</text>
  <text start="1570.23" dur="6.72">not seeing angels what tips advice hints</text>
  <text start="1573.59" dur="5.34">would you have for anyone who would like</text>
  <text start="1576.95" dur="4.32">to increase their ability to see those</text>
  <text start="1578.93" dur="4.95">things yeah I you know I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1581.27" dur="4.71">teaching or like I said since I was 12</text>
  <text start="1583.88" dur="3.57">years old I&amp;#39;ve been actively</text>
  <text start="1585.98" dur="3.69">understanding this is a gift that I have</text>
  <text start="1587.45" dur="4.53">working on it exercising that building</text>
  <text start="1589.67" dur="5.01">that muscle on me on purpose rather than</text>
  <text start="1591.98" dur="5.01">it just happening and I&amp;#39;ve been actively</text>
  <text start="1594.68" dur="6.3">teaching about it for the last ten years</text>
  <text start="1596.99" dur="7.26">or so and there&amp;#39;s a lot of little things</text>
  <text start="1600.98" dur="5.7">but for me it boils down to two two main</text>
  <text start="1604.25" dur="5.22">things and it&amp;#39;s kind of different sides</text>
  <text start="1606.68" dur="6.3">of the same coin the one one side is an</text>
  <text start="1609.47" dur="6.21">important one is just trying because you</text>
  <text start="1612.98" dur="4.74">know I think when I&amp;#39;ve had especially my</text>
  <text start="1615.68" dur="3.3">student and say they teach at the Bethel</text>
  <text start="1617.72" dur="3.36">Atlanta school of supernatural ministry</text>
  <text start="1618.98" dur="3.99">here in Atlanta Georgia and we do a</text>
  <text start="1621.08" dur="3.24">class on say in the spirit and one of</text>
  <text start="1622.97" dur="2.31">the things that I&amp;#39;ve noticed that some</text>
  <text start="1624.32" dur="4.109">of these students who have started</text>
  <text start="1625.28" dur="4.23">learning how to see in the spirit is so</text>
  <text start="1628.429" dur="3.99">many of them tell me</text>
  <text start="1629.51" dur="4.98">oh I&amp;#39;ve noticed these I&amp;#39;ve seen these</text>
  <text start="1632.419" dur="4.081">little hints these little invitations to</text>
  <text start="1634.49" dur="3.48">see more you know a little straight</text>
  <text start="1636.5" dur="3.66">streak of light something that looks</text>
  <text start="1637.97" dur="4.05">like he distortion or you know an</text>
  <text start="1640.16" dur="3.66">outline that&amp;#39;s just kind of like a vague</text>
  <text start="1642.02" dur="3.84">light I&amp;#39;ve seen these things before but</text>
  <text start="1643.82" dur="3.45">I just ignored them I didn&amp;#39;t ask the</text>
  <text start="1645.86" dur="4.05">Holy Spirit about them I didn&amp;#39;t engage</text>
  <text start="1647.27" dur="4.83">with this at all and you know I so I</text>
  <text start="1649.91" dur="4.889">think some of it is believing that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1652.1" dur="5.85">true and by that engaging and practicing</text>
  <text start="1654.799" dur="5.521">trying to look in the spirit as simple</text>
  <text start="1657.95" dur="4.08">and obvious as that is you know taking</text>
  <text start="1660.32" dur="6.15">time to practice and look as a huge huge</text>
  <text start="1662.03" dur="7.05">huge part of it and on the on the other</text>
  <text start="1666.47" dur="5.07">end of the spectrum I or you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1669.08" dur="3.96">kind of the other side of the coin</text>
  <text start="1671.54" dur="6.45">moving towards the same place if you</text>
  <text start="1673.04" dur="7.65">will I am increasingly finding that and</text>

  <text start="1756.499" dur="4.26">feet then the following week I could see</text>
  <text start="1758.69" dur="4.109">its its it&amp;#39;s whole eggs and its hands</text>
  <text start="1760.759" dur="4.41">and then the following week I could see</text>
  <text start="1762.799" dur="4.74">its full body you know just gonna be the</text>
  <text start="1765.169" dur="5.49">particular Angels example but then I</text>
  <text start="1767.539" dur="5.281">couldn&amp;#39;t see its face and sometimes over</text>
  <text start="1770.659" dur="4.11">months sometimes over weeks sometimes</text>
  <text start="1772.82" dur="4.38">over days and sometimes in the course of</text>
  <text start="1774.769" dur="5.52">a single city these things would slowly</text>
  <text start="1777.2" dur="5.219">uncover bit by bit and some of it was</text>
  <text start="1780.289" dur="6.69">just the consistency but some of it was</text>
  <text start="1782.419" dur="6.661">as soon as I understood this it made</text>
  <text start="1786.979" dur="5.101">room for me to see this as soon as I</text>
  <text start="1789.08" dur="5.429">understood this revelation it made it</text>
  <text start="1792.08" dur="4.529">gave a platform for me to understand the</text>
  <text start="1794.509" dur="5.64">next thing which made me see the next</text>
  <text start="1796.609" dur="5.67">more clearly and so recognizing that</text>
  <text start="1800.149" dur="3.87">this isn&amp;#39;t just about there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="1802.279" dur="3.03">wrong with I really want to see angels</text>
  <text start="1804.019" dur="4.89">like there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that</text>
  <text start="1805.309" dur="5.19">desire but if we expand that desire to I</text>
  <text start="1808.909" dur="4.47">want to understand how my father&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1810.499" dur="5.581">kingdom works and I want to go on a</text>
  <text start="1813.379" dur="6.841">relational journey with him to learn</text>
  <text start="1816.08" dur="8.279">that then I think that that mindset sets</text>
  <text start="1820.22" dur="6.75">us up to - in my opinion get at what</text>
  <text start="1824.359" dur="4.92">look at the core of what God is after</text>
  <text start="1826.97" dur="4.019">was I believe this and just about every</text>
  <text start="1829.279" dur="5.82">spiritual gift which is a deeper</text>
  <text start="1830.989" dur="7.89">connection with us and it&amp;#39;s only natural</text>
  <text start="1835.099" dur="5.731">that from that place you know more more</text>
  <text start="1838.879" dur="4.441">activation more ministry more healing</text>
  <text start="1840.83" dur="6.12">more more of the doing side of these</text>
  <text start="1843.32" dur="6.299">things come about but I think that if we</text>
  <text start="1846.95" dur="5.789">make the first priority connecting with</text>
  <text start="1849.619" dur="5.91">him and understanding what kind of</text>
  <text start="1852.739" dur="5.851">business our fathers in to me that</text>
  <text start="1855.529" dur="5.13">mindset has attributed to more people</text>
  <text start="1858.59" dur="5.36">starting to see more much more quickly</text>
  <text start="1860.659" dur="7.32">in my time - teaching here at the school</text>
  <text start="1863.95" dur="5.529">okay you listed two things and I would</text>
  <text start="1867.979" dur="3.57">like to talk a little bit about them and</text>
  <text start="1869.479" dur="5.55">and just explore them a little bit</text>
  <text start="1871.549" dur="7.891">deeper yeah so you mentioned that when</text>
  <text start="1875.029" dur="8.131">you were you know but 12 and you and</text>
  <text start="1879.44" dur="6.39">you&amp;#39;ve also been teaching people mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1883.16" dur="4.8">about those subtle things the little</text>
  <text start="1885.83" dur="4.5">glints of light the an array of light a</text>
  <text start="1887.96" dur="4.08">little you know orb of a circle of</text>
  <text start="1890.33" dur="4.74">something over there and or a shadowy</text>
  <text start="1892.04" dur="4.83">thing moving and they&amp;#39;re like yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="1895.07" dur="3.18">I remember seeing those things and I</text>
  <text start="1896.87" dur="4.26">kind of just blew him off you know</text>
  <text start="1898.25" dur="6.24">dismissed them that that has also been I</text>
  <text start="1901.13" dur="4.56">think my experience my kids when they</text>
  <text start="1904.49" dur="4.44">were growing up they would see those</text>
  <text start="1905.69" dur="5.04">things and I was trying to encourage</text>
  <text start="1908.93" dur="3.33">them look that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1910.73" dur="4.14">your imagination that it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1912.26" dur="3.84">that something that exists in a</text>
  <text start="1914.87" dur="5.63">spiritual world and you need to pay</text>
  <text start="1916.1" dur="9.54">attention to that and I think what I</text>
  <text start="1920.5" dur="7.81">would agree with you that my perspective</text>
  <text start="1925.64" dur="7.58">on learning to see in the spirit is</text>
  <text start="1928.31" dur="9.41">really it is primarily a matter of focus</text>
  <text start="1933.22" dur="8.53">mm-hmm it is focusing your attention on</text>
  <text start="1937.72" dur="6.07">what it is that God is showing you and I</text>
  <text start="1941.75" dur="3.48">think the biggest mistake people make or</text>
  <text start="1943.79" dur="5.25">the biggest handicap they have is they</text>
  <text start="1945.23" dur="5.43">they don&amp;#39;t focus low things off ignore</text>
  <text start="1949.04" dur="3.21">it right attribute it to something else</text>
  <text start="1950.66" dur="3.72">imagination I&amp;#39;m too busy you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1952.25" dur="3.6">to look at that and so you miss a lot</text>
  <text start="1954.38" dur="6.03">and what God is showing you because</text>
  <text start="1955.85" dur="7.05">you&amp;#39;re not focusing when when the Lord</text>
  <text start="1960.41" dur="5.07">was teaching me how to see in the spirit</text>
  <text start="1962.9" dur="3.96">I had to sit I just decided I was gonna</text>
  <text start="1965.48" dur="3.33">sit in the back of my ambulance</text>
  <text start="1966.86" dur="3.96">it was winter it was very slow we were</text>
  <text start="1968.81" dur="3.96">only doing one or two calls a day i sat</text>
  <text start="1970.82" dur="4.2">in the back seat on the bench in the</text>
  <text start="1972.77" dur="5.46">ambulance for hours and hours and hours</text>
  <text start="1975.02" dur="5.4">and just allowed the Holy Spirit to show</text>
  <text start="1978.23" dur="4.16">me different images and at first when I</text>
  <text start="1980.42" dur="4.2">started doing this there were these</text>
  <text start="1982.39" dur="5.17">blurry out-of-focus</text>
  <text start="1984.62" dur="4.8">two-dimensional images and they were</text>
  <text start="1987.56" dur="5.64">just pictures and images of things and</text>
  <text start="1989.42" dur="5.7">people that I recognized and I very</text>
  <text start="1993.2" dur="4.71">quickly realized that what the Lord was</text>
  <text start="1995.12" dur="6.72">doing was he was showing he was teaching</text>
  <text start="1997.91" dur="6.12">me to focus on these images the more I</text>
  <text start="2001.84" dur="4.95">focused on them the more clear they</text>
  <text start="2004.03" dur="4.59">became as you said over the course of</text>
  <text start="2006.79" dur="3.42">days and weeks of doing this and I was</text>
  <text start="2008.62" dur="3.9">doing this day after day after day at</text>
  <text start="2010.21" dur="3.96">work you know it was it was slow time of</text>
  <text start="2012.52" dur="3.66">the year and we would just hang out on a</text>
  <text start="2014.17" dur="3.27">street corner waiting for a call and I</text>
  <text start="2016.18" dur="4.05">would just lay in the back of the mule</text>
  <text start="2017.44" dur="4.14">with my eyes closed and just say okay</text>
  <text start="2020.23" dur="3.079">lord show me stuff and he would search</text>
  <text start="2021.58" dur="5.01">he was showing me all these images and</text>
  <text start="2023.309" dur="5.7">the more I focused on the images the</text>
  <text start="2026.59" dur="4.62">more clear everything became the</text>
  <text start="2029.009" dur="7.991">two-dimensional flat images became</text>
  <text start="2031.21" dur="8.069">three-dimensional at one point if they</text>
  <text start="2037" dur="4.35">were mostly still images and then they</text>
  <text start="2039.279" dur="3.15">turned into moving like videos almost</text>
  <text start="2041.35" dur="4.939">mmm</text>
  <text start="2042.429" dur="6.511">then I saw overlapping scenes then I saw</text>
  <text start="2046.289" dur="5.14">multiple scenes I started to see</text>
  <text start="2048.94" dur="6.149">translucency with you know angels and</text>
  <text start="2051.429" dur="6.871">different things the whole way that I</text>
  <text start="2055.089" dur="5.07">saw was becoming more complex I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="2058.3" dur="3.599">things more clearly the colors are</text>
  <text start="2060.159" dur="4.17">brighter the everything was in focus it</text>
  <text start="2061.899" dur="6.42">was more sharp there wasn&amp;#39;t the</text>
  <text start="2064.329" dur="5.82">blurriness anymore that was kind of my</text>
  <text start="2068.319" dur="4.26">process of learning how to see in the</text>
  <text start="2070.149" dur="5.01">spirit but the thing is it took me</text>
  <text start="2072.579" dur="5.31">months to learn how to do that mm-hmm of</text>
  <text start="2075.159" dur="6.361">every day week after week just spending</text>
  <text start="2077.889" dur="5.7">time alone focusing looking more details</text>
  <text start="2081.52" dur="3.72">and gradually we get sharper and sharper</text>
  <text start="2083.589" dur="4.441">and the other thing that was happening</text>
  <text start="2085.24" dur="6.899">at that time was the Lord was asking me</text>
  <text start="2088.03" dur="5.399">what does this mean I was like I would</text>
  <text start="2092.139" dur="4.831">guess so we&amp;#39;re having this conversation</text>
  <text start="2093.429" dur="5.731">me and the Lord in my mind I would guess</text>
  <text start="2096.97" dur="4.02">what that image meant and it would stay</text>
  <text start="2099.16" dur="2.4">there if I was wrong the image would</text>
  <text start="2100.99" dur="3.27">stay there</text>
  <text start="2101.56" dur="4.65">guess again so I guess again and if I</text>
  <text start="2104.26" dur="3.96">was wrong it would stay there it would</text>
  <text start="2106.21" dur="3.84">stay there until I guessed right mmm I</text>
  <text start="2108.22" dur="3.93">got when I guessed correctly what he was</text>
  <text start="2110.05" dur="4.769">trying to convey to me I would see a new</text>
  <text start="2112.15" dur="5.16">image and then I would guess what that</text>
  <text start="2114.819" dur="3.571">image meant until I got it right and</text>
  <text start="2117.31" dur="2.88">then it would disappear and I would see</text>
  <text start="2118.39" dur="3.719">another one and another one and another</text>
  <text start="2120.19" dur="4.98">one another one I saw thousands of</text>
  <text start="2122.109" dur="6.121">images over this period where the Lord</text>
  <text start="2125.17" dur="6.09">was was he was doing two things one he</text>
  <text start="2128.23" dur="6.27">was training me to focus my mind on the</text>
  <text start="2131.26" dur="8.46">subtleties and training me to get clear</text>
  <text start="2134.5" dur="9.26">images in my mind second he was training</text>
  <text start="2139.72" dur="7.2">me to learn his spiritual language</text>
  <text start="2143.76" dur="5.92">because one of the big problems that</text>
  <text start="2146.92" dur="3.84">that we all struggle with is okay great</text>
  <text start="2149.68" dur="3.64">you see the</text>
  <text start="2150.76" dur="4.64">thing in the spirit what does it mean</text>
  <text start="2153.32" dur="5.06">[Laughter]</text>
  <text start="2155.4" dur="5.14">you know what what is this relevance how</text>
  <text start="2158.38" dur="4.77">does it connect to anything it&amp;#39;s and and</text>
  <text start="2160.54" dur="4.98">the thing that I guess makes me kind of</text>
  <text start="2163.15" dur="5.97">laugh is like okay great - the Angels</text>
  <text start="2165.52" dur="5.61">why you just want to entertain yourself</text>
  <text start="2169.12" dur="4.74">and see angels you know I&amp;#39;m bored I want</text>
  <text start="2171.13" dur="4.85">to go see some angels well if you see</text>
  <text start="2173.86" dur="4.71">angels you&amp;#39;re seeing them for a reason</text>
  <text start="2175.98" dur="4.69">have you ever asked you know the Lord</text>
  <text start="2178.57" dur="5.94">why am I seeing this angel what is the</text>
  <text start="2180.67" dur="5.52">reason for it right I know that you</text>
  <text start="2184.51" dur="4.2">talked in the book about going and</text>
  <text start="2186.19" dur="5.16">seeing going out and in a you know</text>
  <text start="2188.71" dur="4.26">spiritual world and seeing things didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2191.35" dur="5.34">an angel come to you and warn you about</text>
  <text start="2192.97" dur="9.3">like not treating this just for your own</text>
  <text start="2196.69" dur="9.81">amusement always interesting for me this</text>
  <text start="2202.27" dur="6.57">because I it that is something I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2206.5" dur="4.29">struggled with so much what if you know</text>
  <text start="2208.84" dur="5.3">I think from especially from that 12</text>
  <text start="2210.79" dur="6.75">years old to 22 years old season where I</text>
  <text start="2214.14" dur="5.17">you know I would try to use it all the</text>
  <text start="2217.54" dur="4.95">time you know especially right away and</text>
  <text start="2219.31" dur="6.15">I would get trouble partially partially</text>
  <text start="2222.49" dur="5.52">because of my immaturity and partially</text>
  <text start="2225.46" dur="4.77">just because it you know I was still</text>
  <text start="2228.01" dur="4.29">learning how what to make of this you</text>
  <text start="2230.23" dur="3.93">know what to do with this and you know I</text>
  <text start="2232.3" dur="4.14">went to one extreme like I remember</text>
  <text start="2234.16" dur="3.12">early on I you know I didn&amp;#39;t put the</text>
  <text start="2236.44" dur="3.63">store in the book cause it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="2237.28" dur="4.44">embarrassing but I um there&amp;#39;s this guy</text>
  <text start="2240.07" dur="3.56">back in the church see this demonic</text>
  <text start="2241.72" dur="5.01">thing hanging out on his shoulder</text>
  <text start="2243.63" dur="4.81">discern what it is walk up to them and</text>
  <text start="2246.73" dur="3.45">like okay you know somebody saw</text>
  <text start="2248.44" dur="4.08">something demonic on me I suppose I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2250.18" dur="4.2">welcome to mention it you know well I</text>
  <text start="2252.52" dur="4.62">mean but you know let me know what to do</text>
  <text start="2254.38" dur="5.06">about it now this guy was probably in</text>
  <text start="2257.14" dur="5.04">his mid-40s I was 13 years old and</text>
  <text start="2259.44" dur="4.15">walked up to all the silver and said hey</text>
  <text start="2262.18" dur="4.35">you should probably stop looking at</text>
  <text start="2263.59" dur="3.96">pornography and for some reason he</text>
  <text start="2266.53" dur="3.51">didn&amp;#39;t find that very edifying</text>
  <text start="2267.55" dur="4.86">encouraging or comforting you did not</text>
  <text start="2270.04" dur="3.75">say that out loud did you yeah out loud</text>
  <text start="2272.41" dur="6.3">at the back of the church I mean there</text>
  <text start="2273.79" dur="8.809">wasn&amp;#39;t more so I learned that that maybe</text>
  <text start="2278.71" dur="6.289">was not the most most weight</text>
  <text start="2282.599" dur="6.18">to use that gift and so I so I think</text>
  <text start="2284.999" dur="6.691">mistakes like that you know got going on</text>
  <text start="2288.779" dur="6.921">and then other times I&amp;#39;d get frustrated</text>
  <text start="2291.69" dur="6.419">because I meet now especially for me and</text>
  <text start="2295.7" dur="4.029">because I&amp;#39;d be I&amp;#39;d see something I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2298.109" dur="2.821">understand a little bit of what a minute</text>
  <text start="2299.729" dur="2.79">I&amp;#39;d share it with someone but then</text>
  <text start="2300.93" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;d have 14 more questions about why</text>
  <text start="2302.519" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s like this why this I just didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2304.44" dur="3.72">have the language the understanding or</text>
  <text start="2306.299" dur="5.04">the or the familiarity with all but to</text>
  <text start="2308.16" dur="4.609">to nail down you know what what that</text>
  <text start="2311.339" dur="5.071">mandatory if that meant anything</text>
  <text start="2312.769" dur="5.74">significant to the moment and so I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2316.41" dur="4.29">kind of do to two different Teufel</text>
  <text start="2318.509" dur="4.8">things to talk a little about that one I</text>
  <text start="2320.7" dur="5.609">remember one day it started to click for</text>
  <text start="2323.309" dur="4.56">me when cuz I used to get frustrated</text>
  <text start="2326.309" dur="4.26">because some stuff I would see and it</text>
  <text start="2327.869" dur="4.021">makes sense that angel is wearing armor</text>
  <text start="2330.569" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;s leaning up against the wall it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2331.89" dur="4.32">standing up or straight it&amp;#39;s got this</text>
  <text start="2334.049" dur="6.391">very attentively looking its eye that</text>
  <text start="2336.21" dur="6.089">looks feels in every way like some kind</text>
  <text start="2340.44" dur="3.24">of guard or protection control that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2342.299" dur="3.601">everything about the way that angel</text>
  <text start="2343.68" dur="3.48">looks at Vokes that that and so</text>
  <text start="2345.9" dur="4.169">sometimes it was pretty straight forward</text>
  <text start="2347.16" dur="4.679">like that but other times I worship is</text>
  <text start="2350.069" dur="4.41">going on and I just see this really</text>

  <text start="2354.479" dur="8.401">made out of something between you know</text>
  <text start="2356.279" dur="8.31">lava and orange soda and what is this</text>
  <text start="2362.88" dur="3.209">thing this is weird this is confusing</text>
  <text start="2364.589" dur="3.63">this abstract what am I supposed to do</text>
  <text start="2366.089" dur="4.38">with this and I&amp;#39;d get frustrated you</text>
  <text start="2368.219" dur="5.34">know I remember one day I walked into</text>
  <text start="2370.469" dur="4.11">church and you know I I was going</text>
  <text start="2373.559" dur="2.821">through my teenage years this whole</text>
  <text start="2374.579" dur="3.98">thing so I was getting angsty for other</text>
  <text start="2376.38" dur="4.229">reasons all throughout all this but I</text>
  <text start="2378.559" dur="4.391">walked on the back of the church and</text>
  <text start="2380.609" dur="5.101">worship is going on and there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="2382.95" dur="5.279">kind of just stuff that looks like if</text>
  <text start="2385.71" dur="3.659">you&amp;#39;ve ever seen a video or been up in</text>
  <text start="2388.229" dur="3.901">the north and seen the world borealis</text>
  <text start="2389.369" dur="4.11">the Northern Lights there was this light</text>
  <text start="2392.13" dur="3.659">that kind of looked like that it was at</text>
  <text start="2393.479" dur="5.1">this wavy liked in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="2395.789" dur="5.04">stage it was about 10 feet by 10 feet</text>
  <text start="2398.579" dur="4.621">and it was just kind of oscillating back</text>
  <text start="2400.829" dur="3.871">and forth and this what seemed like a</text>
  <text start="2403.2" dur="2.789">more or less arbitrary path with a</text>
  <text start="2404.7" dur="2.279">consistent pattern rather just seeing</text>
  <text start="2405.989" dur="3.63">the archetype is just kind of</text>
  <text start="2406.979" dur="4.77">oscillating in this link together apart</text>
  <text start="2409.619" dur="3.66">together apart sort of like I remember</text>
  <text start="2411.749" dur="3.57">my attitude was terrible I&amp;#39;m like what</text>
  <text start="2413.279" dur="2.681">what is that what is the point of that</text>
  <text start="2415.319" dur="3.101">why</text>
  <text start="2415.96" dur="6.99">that there why do I care why am I seeing</text>
  <text start="2418.42" dur="6.36">you am I supposed to do and so this is</text>
  <text start="2422.95" dur="5.399">my conversation with the holy spirit and</text>
  <text start="2424.78" dur="6.96">so all of a sudden I just feel this</text>
  <text start="2428.349" dur="4.801">little tug and I noticed this older lady</text>
  <text start="2431.74" dur="3.629">who&amp;#39;s sitting in the front row of the</text>
  <text start="2433.15" dur="5.18">church and she&amp;#39;s got she&amp;#39;s sitting down</text>
  <text start="2435.369" dur="4.98">she&amp;#39;s leaning forward got her you know</text>
  <text start="2438.33" dur="3.519">fingers crossed and just kind of leaning</text>
  <text start="2440.349" dur="6.481">on on the tops of her hands</text>
  <text start="2441.849" dur="6.481">and she um I had this feeling pop up it</text>
  <text start="2446.83" dur="3.57">didn&amp;#39;t pop up in the front of my mind it</text>
  <text start="2448.33" dur="3.779">popped up in the back of my mind and I</text>
  <text start="2450.4" dur="3.09">if what happened afterwards didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2452.109" dur="3.841">happen I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t even notice</text>
  <text start="2453.49" dur="4.349">this little judgment towards this moment</text>
  <text start="2455.95" dur="3.6">popped of my head now it was something</text>
  <text start="2457.839" dur="4.081">that was culturally going on my church</text>
  <text start="2459.55" dur="4.35">at the time again not anything that</text>
  <text start="2461.92" dur="3.9">anyone taught or anyone actively said it</text>
  <text start="2463.9" dur="4.26">was the back of the mind saying but and</text>
  <text start="2465.82" dur="5.34">the this this cultural thing that was</text>
  <text start="2468.16" dur="4.439">there but not actively present was you</text>
  <text start="2471.16" dur="3.51">know we had a church that had a really</text>
  <text start="2472.599" dur="3.451">strong value for worship and it was one</text>
  <text start="2474.67" dur="7.77">of the giftings in the church which was</text>
  <text start="2476.05" dur="8.49">awesome but the idea somehow got in the</text>
  <text start="2482.44" dur="4.8">back of the cultural mind said that if</text>
  <text start="2484.54" dur="5.61">you&amp;#39;re not physically actively engaging</text>
  <text start="2487.24" dur="4.95">in worship in a passionate way then</text>
  <text start="2490.15" dur="4.4">maybe you&amp;#39;re not being as much of a</text>
  <text start="2492.19" dur="5.04">worshipper as the person to your right</text>
  <text start="2494.55" dur="4.75">and even me saying that explicitly is</text>
  <text start="2497.23" dur="3.57">not at all what the culture was but it</text>
  <text start="2499.3" dur="3.42">was in the back of the mob you know is</text>
  <text start="2500.8" dur="6">the ring right the background of the</text>
  <text start="2502.72" dur="5.94">culture mindset there and so I had that</text>
  <text start="2506.8" dur="3.51">feeling pop up again is enough in the</text>
  <text start="2508.66" dur="4.35">background I didn&amp;#39;t really register it</text>
  <text start="2510.31" dur="5.43">and the second but that feeling popped</text>
  <text start="2513.01" dur="4.14">up my vision switched and I saw straight</text>
  <text start="2515.74" dur="6.15">through the woman like it was an x-ray</text>
  <text start="2517.15" dur="7.38">and it like kind of focused until the</text>
  <text start="2521.89" dur="6.32">point where it I kind of registered on</text>
  <text start="2524.53" dur="6.93">where her heart was and as I looked I</text>
  <text start="2528.21" dur="5.08">noticed there was this light in the</text>
  <text start="2531.46" dur="4.649">moving through the four chambers of her</text>
  <text start="2533.29" dur="5.819">heart and it was moving back and forth</text>
  <text start="2536.109" dur="4.831">between the chambers of her heart in</text>
  <text start="2539.109" dur="4.831">this rhythmic way that was moving with</text>
  <text start="2540.94" dur="4.95">her heartbeat well all the sudden I look</text>
  <text start="2543.94" dur="3.63">at that pattern looks familiar</text>
  <text start="2545.89" dur="3.27">I look up back at the center of the</text>
  <text start="2547.57" dur="2.02">stage above the stage where everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2549.16" dur="2.74">the</text>
  <text start="2549.59" dur="3.96">leading worship and it&amp;#39;s even though</text>
  <text start="2551.9" dur="4.74">it&amp;#39;s a different size it&amp;#39;s the exact</text>
  <text start="2553.55" dur="4.98">same pattern of light and pattern of</text>
  <text start="2556.64" dur="4.38">movement as what&amp;#39;s happening in her</text>
  <text start="2558.53" dur="4.2">heart and as soon as I recognized that</text>
  <text start="2561.02" dur="3.24">it was the exact same pattern the exact</text>
  <text start="2562.73" dur="4.02">same movement I looked around the room</text>
  <text start="2564.26" dur="5.07">and saw that there was tons of people I</text>
  <text start="2566.75" dur="4.29">kind of extra thing happened again or I</text>
  <text start="2569.33" dur="3.72">could see that their heart had this</text>
  <text start="2571.04" dur="4.68">light in it that was moving in exact</text>
  <text start="2573.05" dur="5.15">rhythm with this light and then I just</text>
  <text start="2575.72" dur="4.74">heard the Holy Spirit say I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2578.2" dur="7.12">sinking the rhythm of their hearts to</text>
  <text start="2580.46" dur="10.16">mine and that was one of many many many</text>
  <text start="2585.32" dur="5.3">honestly hundreds of moments where I</text>
  <text start="2590.68" dur="8.14">learned to look and listen and hunt for</text>
  <text start="2596.99" dur="4.05">what the Holy Spirit was saying and</text>
  <text start="2598.82" dur="5.4">doing with the things that I saw not</text>
  <text start="2601.04" dur="5.37">just try to get me what I considered to</text>
  <text start="2604.22" dur="4.08">be the explicit value of something or</text>
  <text start="2606.41" dur="3.63">what I would consider to be important or</text>
  <text start="2608.3" dur="3.12">what I would consider to be the reason</text>
  <text start="2610.04" dur="5.25">that you would put something or do</text>
  <text start="2611.42" dur="5.6">something or or you know what would have</text>
  <text start="2615.29" dur="5.13">something going on in the spirit and</text>
  <text start="2617.02" dur="6.52">moments like that helped me develop</text>
  <text start="2620.42" dur="4.98">understanding and learn how to look for</text>
  <text start="2623.54" dur="5.15">what the purposes of even these</text>
  <text start="2625.4" dur="6.21">mysteries and abstract things and now I</text>
  <text start="2628.69" dur="4.51">I would say and I I know that a lot of</text>
  <text start="2631.61" dur="5.88">this has to do with my personality I</text>
  <text start="2633.2" dur="6.36">tend to be more of an observer by nature</text>
  <text start="2637.49" dur="3.72">I like to watch I like to understand I</text>
  <text start="2639.56" dur="5.12">like to kind of pick things apart and</text>
  <text start="2641.21" dur="5.46">put them back together and so I don&amp;#39;t um</text>
  <text start="2644.68" dur="4.42">I&amp;#39;m trying to strike a balance between</text>
  <text start="2646.67" dur="6.03">these two things but I often like to</text>
  <text start="2649.1" dur="5.37">suggest that I think you know it&amp;#39;s based</text>
  <text start="2652.7" dur="3.87">even on my own experience like the</text>
  <text start="2654.47" dur="4.5">number of stuff that I see in a given</text>
  <text start="2656.57" dur="4.23">day the remember stuff that I could see</text>
  <text start="2658.97" dur="4.29">if I just turn it on at any given moment</text>
  <text start="2660.8" dur="3.93">you know I could I could you know I</text>
  <text start="2663.26" dur="3.12">could go to I live near the town of</text>
  <text start="2664.73" dur="4.65">Georgia and I could I could run down to</text>
  <text start="2666.38" dur="4.17">the downtown Atlanta right now start</text>
  <text start="2669.38" dur="2.49">looking the spirit and I can spend the</text>
  <text start="2670.55" dur="3.42">rest of my entire life</text>
  <text start="2671.87" dur="3.8">just saying the good things that I see</text>
  <text start="2673.97" dur="4.08">around every single person there and</text>
  <text start="2675.67" dur="4.06">every cd-i I could do that because</text>
  <text start="2678.05" dur="3.75">there&amp;#39;s enough you know there&amp;#39;s enough</text>
  <text start="2679.73" dur="3.51">to see there&amp;#39;s enough going on but I</text>
  <text start="2681.8" dur="2.64">could do that now</text>
  <text start="2683.24" dur="4.29">I think kids probably wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2684.44" dur="5.94">appreciate that and you know what would</text>
  <text start="2687.53" dur="4.41">that be and even if that you know if</text>
  <text start="2690.38" dur="4.56">somehow we could practice to make that</text>
  <text start="2691.94" dur="4.5">work would that be the most would that</text>
  <text start="2694.94" dur="2.94">be the highest calling of my life would</text>
  <text start="2696.44" dur="4.2">that be the way I could be the most</text>
  <text start="2697.88" dur="6.11">effective for God&amp;#39;s kingdom you know I</text>
  <text start="2700.64" dur="8.24">sometimes I don&amp;#39;t think so because</text>
  <text start="2703.99" dur="7.78">because unless I&amp;#39;m if I feel the need to</text>
  <text start="2708.88" dur="5.17">respond at least in the way that I would</text>
  <text start="2711.77" dur="4.56">think that I should to every single</text>
  <text start="2714.05" dur="5.12">thing that I see I can kind of get like</text>
  <text start="2716.33" dur="5.7">a bad you know superhero mentality where</text>
  <text start="2719.17" dur="4.9">I think everything that I see is my</text>
  <text start="2722.03" dur="4.38">responsibility and to me that either</text>
  <text start="2724.07" dur="4.95">there&amp;#39;s one of two things it sets me up</text>
  <text start="2726.41" dur="4.43">for burnout or it limits me to only</text>
  <text start="2729.02" dur="5.64">seeing the things that I meant to do</text>
  <text start="2730.84" dur="8.14">something very explicit with if I open</text>
  <text start="2734.66" dur="6.36">up my mind to the idea that I can see</text>
  <text start="2738.98" dur="5.58">lots of things and in fact maybe by</text>
  <text start="2741.02" dur="8.04">design I can see more than I expressly</text>
  <text start="2744.56" dur="7.08">need to see then it&amp;#39;s not just about</text>
  <text start="2749.06" dur="6.24">what am I supposed to do actively with</text>
  <text start="2751.64" dur="8.64">this but it&amp;#39;s also what can this teach</text>
  <text start="2755.3" dur="7.59">me about who God is and because in my</text>
  <text start="2760.28" dur="4.8">mind God doesn&amp;#39;t just want to know what</text>
  <text start="2762.89" dur="3.57">we&amp;#39;re supposed to do he also wants us to</text>
  <text start="2765.08" dur="3.779">understand how it works and how he</text>
  <text start="2766.46" dur="5.01">thinks and so it&amp;#39;s kind of a long answer</text>
  <text start="2768.859" dur="7.381">to some of that question but I kind of</text>
  <text start="2771.47" dur="7.02">go both ways where I think that I think</text>
  <text start="2776.24" dur="4.35">that sometimes the vet the value in</text>
  <text start="2778.49" dur="4.32">seeing something can be as simple as oh</text>
  <text start="2780.59" dur="3.93">I understand what you&amp;#39;re up to a little</text>
  <text start="2782.81" dur="4.049">bit more and can live my life</text>
  <text start="2784.52" dur="5.67">accordingly just a little bit more you</text>
  <text start="2786.859" dur="6.651">know yeah well I appreciate you going</text>
  <text start="2790.19" dur="8.07">into going into a little bit more depth</text>
  <text start="2793.51" dur="6.43">in how you put all this together you</text>
  <text start="2798.26" dur="6.84">know I have a friend who talks a lot</text>
  <text start="2799.94" dur="8.1">about the concept of hearing revelation</text>
  <text start="2805.1" dur="8.49">that is intended for other people it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2808.04" dur="7.62">like if you put up a radio receiver in</text>
  <text start="2813.59" dur="3.48">your home you can pick up a lot of</text>
  <text start="2815.66" dur="4.08">different radio</text>
  <text start="2817.07" dur="4.29">annals in traffic there&amp;#39;s you know stray</text>
  <text start="2819.74" dur="3.93">radio frequencies going through</text>
  <text start="2821.36" dur="3.96">everybody&amp;#39;s house all the time does it</text>
  <text start="2823.67" dur="4.68">mean you&amp;#39;re supposed to focus in and</text>
  <text start="2825.32" dur="5.91">listen to all of it probably not a lot</text>
  <text start="2828.35" dur="4.2">of it&amp;#39;s not intended for you there are</text>
  <text start="2831.23" dur="3.36">things going on all around us in the</text>
  <text start="2832.55" dur="4.56">world in spiritual world most people are</text>
  <text start="2834.59" dur="4.53">kind of oblivious to does it mean that</text>
  <text start="2837.11" dur="3.9">you have to be focused on all of it</text>
  <text start="2839.12" dur="4.11">doesn&amp;#39;t mean all of it is for you just</text>
  <text start="2841.01" dur="4.92">because you see it does that mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2843.23" dur="4.2">intended for you maybe not I see a lot</text>
  <text start="2845.93" dur="3.35">of people every day when I go to the</text>
  <text start="2847.43" dur="4.41">grocery store or the hardware store and</text>
  <text start="2849.28" dur="5.71">I see them it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2851.84" dur="5.01">gonna have an interaction with them for</text>
  <text start="2854.99" dur="3.96">me it always comes down to this question</text>
  <text start="2856.85" dur="5.1">now and I&amp;#39;m just gonna go off on a</text>
  <text start="2858.95" dur="5.76">rabbit trail here I&amp;#39;m sure for some</text>
  <text start="2861.95" dur="4.83">reason Christians and I don&amp;#39;t know maybe</text>
  <text start="2864.71" dur="5.52">charismatic Christians tend to be really</text>
  <text start="2866.78" dur="5.7">interested in conspiracy theories I have</text>
  <text start="2870.23" dur="6.51">all these friends who guard just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2872.48" dur="6.09">wait to in the next episode of Alex</text>
  <text start="2876.74" dur="4.17">Jones and the latest conspiracy theory</text>

  <text start="2909.17" dur="7.38">little rabbits down holes what what I am</text>
  <text start="2912.5" dur="6.54">have learned his most effective is I you</text>
  <text start="2916.55" dur="4.35">know what did Jesus say the son can do</text>
  <text start="2919.04" dur="3.87">nothing of himself but only what he sees</text>
  <text start="2920.9" dur="5.67">the father doing right mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="2922.91" dur="6.15">so Jesus could have done a lot of things</text>
  <text start="2926.57" dur="3.96">Jesus could have interacted with a lot</text>
  <text start="2929.06" dur="2.85">of people could have been a lot of</text>
  <text start="2930.53" dur="5.52">places could have done a lot of things</text>
  <text start="2931.91" dur="8.76">but he was always focused on what the</text>
  <text start="2936.05" dur="8.73">father is doing and saying I think the</text>
  <text start="2940.67" dur="7.2">the great value of all of this is try to</text>
  <text start="2944.78" dur="6.06">focus on what God is has specifically</text>
  <text start="2947.87" dur="5.37">has for you to do people he wants you</text>
  <text start="2950.84" dur="5.91">with ministry he wants you to accomplish</text>
  <text start="2953.24" dur="4.74">and block out everything else and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2956.75" dur="3.15">what I do unfortunately for a lot of my</text>
  <text start="2957.98" dur="3.3">friends I have to tell them look please</text>
  <text start="2959.9" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t send me those links I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2961.28" dur="5.46">time to go tracking all stuff God has</text>
  <text start="2964.16" dur="4.65">not put that on my radar he just hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2966.74" dur="3.6">you know I have friends who are like</text>
  <text start="2968.81" dur="4.44">really interested in you know</text>
  <text start="2970.34" dur="4.02">vaccinations theories and chemtrails and</text>
  <text start="2973.25" dur="2.97">everything else I&amp;#39;m like look God has</text>
  <text start="2974.36" dur="5.49">never put any of that stuff on my radar</text>
  <text start="2976.22" dur="6.51">and it&amp;#39;s just I I have to focus on what</text>
  <text start="2979.85" dur="5.94">God is putting on my radar at any given</text>
  <text start="2982.73" dur="4.29">time and there&amp;#39;s a lot of distractions a</text>
  <text start="2985.79" dur="2.64">lot of things out there you can see a</text>
  <text start="2987.02" dur="3.27">lot of things you can be you know</text>
  <text start="2988.43" dur="3.9">interested in and pursue but it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2990.29" dur="5.25">mean that that is your assignment from</text>
  <text start="2992.33" dur="5.94">God you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re going if you</text>

  <text start="3006.97" dur="4.17">and ignore the things that need to be</text>
  <text start="3008.83" dur="3.3">ignored because there&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff</text>
  <text start="3011.14" dur="3.2">out there that probably needs to be</text>
  <text start="3012.13" dur="4.95">ignored well I think when you focus on</text>
  <text start="3014.34" dur="5.92">what God is specifically speaking to you</text>
  <text start="3017.08" dur="7.11">about it is it does help you understand</text>
  <text start="3020.26" dur="6.87">his kingdom his heart and his plan and</text>
  <text start="3024.19" dur="7.4">how he wants to use you to impact the</text>
  <text start="3027.13" dur="9.75">world now I have a question for you um I</text>
  <text start="3031.59" dur="7.6">was teaching in Tucson oh gosh six</text>
  <text start="3036.88" dur="5.52">months ago at a school of supernatural</text>
  <text start="3039.19" dur="5.04">and I offered to you know pray for</text>
  <text start="3042.4" dur="5.01">people after I got done teaching and</text>
  <text start="3044.23" dur="5.88">this gal comes up and she has ringing in</text>
  <text start="3047.41" dur="4.5">her ears and I was like great why</text>
  <text start="3050.11" dur="3.51">couldn&amp;#39;t it be something else I just I</text>
  <text start="3051.91" dur="3.12">have a horrible track record for praying</text>
  <text start="3053.62" dur="3.42">with people with ringing in the ears and</text>
  <text start="3055.03" dur="3.51">I had prayed for a lot of people and I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="3057.04" dur="5.25">never seen anybody heal to bring it in</text>
  <text start="3058.54" dur="5.16">the ears so I had been teaching on you</text>
  <text start="3062.29" dur="6.57">know singing in the spirit and things of</text>
  <text start="3063.7" dur="7.26">that nature during the lesson so the</text>
  <text start="3068.86" dur="4.2">Lord says why don&amp;#39;t you close your eyes</text>
  <text start="3070.96" dur="3.96">and take your own advice and see if I</text>
  <text start="3073.06" dur="3.57">show you anything so this lady is</text>
  <text start="3074.92" dur="4.62">standing in front of me and I see</text>
  <text start="3076.63" dur="5.1">something and you know the the the</text>
  <text start="3079.54" dur="4.59">clearest thing I can describe it as it</text>
  <text start="3081.73" dur="5.76">looked like a branch of a cactus</text>
  <text start="3084.13" dur="5.13">stuck on top of her head like somebody</text>
  <text start="3087.49" dur="3.78">had just taken this branch of a cactus</text>
  <text start="3089.26" dur="4.26">about three inches in diameter and just</text>
  <text start="3091.27" dur="5.31">stuck the spines right into the top of</text>
  <text start="3093.52" dur="5.85">her head and I was like oh that&amp;#39;s weird</text>
  <text start="3096.58" dur="6.9">why is there like a cactus stuck on top</text>
  <text start="3099.37" dur="7.13">of her head so I was like okay I think I</text>
  <text start="3103.48" dur="6">read about this you know in Blake&amp;#39;s book</text>
  <text start="3106.5" dur="4.84">demonic devices I just did a prophetic</text>
  <text start="3109.48" dur="3.78">act I reached over and I pulled this</text>
  <text start="3111.34" dur="4.62">thing off of her head in the spirit and</text>
  <text start="3113.26" dur="4.92">she was like oh my god what did you do</text>
  <text start="3115.96" dur="6.12">she&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s crazy the ringing</text>
  <text start="3118.18" dur="5.7">stopped the ringing in her ears stopped</text>
  <text start="3122.08" dur="3.84">and she said I feel like there&amp;#39;s an open</text>
  <text start="3123.88" dur="4.68">spot in my head but I could feel cool</text>
  <text start="3125.92" dur="4.38">air rushing into my head and the ringing</text>
  <text start="3128.56" dur="5.64">was completely gone</text>
  <text start="3130.3" dur="6.3">so I have some friends who see in the</text>
  <text start="3134.2" dur="4.89">spirit very acutely and they see these</text>
  <text start="3136.6" dur="5.7">demonic devices on people sometimes I</text>
  <text start="3139.09" dur="5.01">see you know bombs booby traps different</text>
  <text start="3142.3" dur="3.93">demonic devices that have been attached</text>
  <text start="3144.1" dur="5.97">to people I read your book</text>
  <text start="3146.23" dur="6.75">you you know chains and shackles and all</text>
  <text start="3150.07" dur="5.94">these different things mm-hmm can you</text>
  <text start="3152.98" dur="5.19">talk a little bit about those devices in</text>
  <text start="3156.01" dur="5.64">the spirit that people are not aware of</text>
  <text start="3158.17" dur="6.6">and how you deal with those things and</text>
  <text start="3161.65" dur="6.39">you know what what practical tips you</text>
  <text start="3164.77" dur="6.48">could give for people on that yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="3168.04" dur="6.99">I it&amp;#39;s interesting I I see a fair number</text>
  <text start="3171.25" dur="7.56">of those and I my general advice would</text>
  <text start="3175.03" dur="6.3">be I even as frequently as I see those</text>
  <text start="3178.81" dur="5.01">things as familiar as I have got on with</text>
  <text start="3181.33" dur="5.37">dealing with them and praying about them</text>
  <text start="3183.82" dur="4.11">and doing that every single time it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3186.7" dur="3.18">funny because I feel the same like</text>
  <text start="3187.93" dur="3.06">nervousness in my heart whenever I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3189.88" dur="2.85">doing something especially when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3190.99" dur="4.61">dealing with some kind of sickness or</text>
  <text start="3192.73" dur="5.04">something there&amp;#39;s a tangible you know</text>
  <text start="3195.6" dur="6.64">problem you know going along with this</text>
  <text start="3197.77" dur="7.47">thing I approach it with complete</text>
  <text start="3202.24" dur="5.61">knowledge that I am a hundred percent of</text>
  <text start="3205.24" dur="5.04">helpless unless that I hear from the</text>
  <text start="3207.85" dur="5.91">Holy Spirit how to how to deal with this</text>
  <text start="3210.28" dur="6.63">or how to approach it and not personally</text>
  <text start="3213.76" dur="4.2">at least gotten to any spot where it</text>
  <text start="3216.91" dur="2.73">feels like it</text>
  <text start="3217.96" dur="4.95">for me here&amp;#39;s the one two three steps on</text>
  <text start="3219.64" dur="5.449">how to how to do this um I remember one</text>
  <text start="3222.91" dur="5.55">particular time I was I was still</text>
  <text start="3225.089" dur="5.711">ministry student and Ethel in reading</text>
  <text start="3228.46" dur="5.94">and I was on the prayer line someone</text>
  <text start="3230.8" dur="4.559">came up they had back pain and even</text>
  <text start="3234.4" dur="2.58">though I&amp;#39;ve been really involved in the</text>
  <text start="3235.359" dur="3.24">prophetic from a young age healing was</text>
  <text start="3236.98" dur="4.68">something that was relatively new to me</text>
  <text start="3238.599" dur="5.161">upon going to school there and you know</text>
  <text start="3241.66" dur="4.709">I pray for people to be healed but you</text>
  <text start="3243.76" dur="4.32">know the active intentional way of</text>
  <text start="3246.369" dur="3">really going after it was just again I</text>
  <text start="3248.08" dur="5.13">just hadn&amp;#39;t been a really familiar with</text>
  <text start="3249.369" dur="6.091">him up to that point and so I thereby I</text>
  <text start="3253.21" dur="4.47">hadn&amp;#39;t really applied you know the my</text>
  <text start="3255.46" dur="4.32">experiencing to see the spirit to that</text>
  <text start="3257.68" dur="4.59">and I remember this was really the first</text>
  <text start="3259.78" dur="3.72">day called ignorance whatever else so</text>
  <text start="3262.27" dur="3.72">this is halfway through the school year</text>
  <text start="3263.5" dur="4.17">but Oh wonder if I should just look in</text>
  <text start="3265.99" dur="4.859">the spheres and see what&amp;#39;s causing this</text>
  <text start="3267.67" dur="5.03">person&amp;#39;s back pain and and it was the</text>
  <text start="3270.849" dur="5.961">first time it occurred to me and so I</text>
  <text start="3272.7" dur="6.76">looked at their back and I saw this</text>
  <text start="3276.81" dur="4.87">clamp around their spine right in</text>
  <text start="3279.46" dur="3.899">between their shoulder blades and it had</text>
  <text start="3281.68" dur="4.26">like a turnkey look like a mechanical</text>
  <text start="3283.359" dur="4.98">clamp and a head a turnkey so I touched</text>
  <text start="3285.94" dur="4.8">the spot and said Heiser right here but</text>
  <text start="3288.339" dur="4.591">it hurts and they said yeah that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3290.74" dur="3.99">exactly the spot and I said you know I</text>
  <text start="3292.93" dur="4.8">honestly I felt kind of silly but I felt</text>
  <text start="3294.73" dur="5.28">like it was supposed to turn the key so</text>
  <text start="3297.73" dur="4.56">I said hey um this is what I see I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3300.01" dur="5.25">just going to pantomime but turning this</text>
  <text start="3302.29" dur="5.61">key right now and he let me know what</text>
  <text start="3305.26" dur="4.17">happens and so I did that and you know</text>
  <text start="3307.9" dur="6.09">lefty-loosey from all that did all that</text>
  <text start="3309.43" dur="6.48">right and I just turned this key and the</text>
  <text start="3313.99" dur="6">person said they literally felt it</text>
  <text start="3315.91" dur="8.22">loosen loosen loosen and the pain left</text>
  <text start="3319.99" dur="5.91">and so again that was one versus it you</text>
  <text start="3324.13" dur="5.04">know I don&amp;#39;t there&amp;#39;s still at least for</text>
  <text start="3325.9" dur="5.969">me a lot of mystery in this because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3329.17" dur="5.25">like okay that&amp;#39;s not literally a clamp</text>
  <text start="3331.869" dur="5.101">that is on their back that literally the</text>
  <text start="3334.42" dur="4.5">solution to it is it being loosened it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3336.97" dur="5.43">it&amp;#39;s a representation of a spiritual</text>
  <text start="3338.92" dur="5.16">attack or a spiritual oppression and but</text>
  <text start="3342.4" dur="4.709">there is something about the physical</text>
  <text start="3344.08" dur="5.37">act of faith of okay I feel like this is</text>
  <text start="3347.109" dur="4.321">what I&amp;#39;m supposed to do so I&amp;#39;m gonna do</text>
  <text start="3349.45" dur="4.859">it I had a more dramatic one Reese</text>
  <text start="3351.43" dur="5.46">where this woman came to me and she was</text>
  <text start="3354.309" dur="5.55">have been diagnosed with cancer she had</text>
  <text start="3356.89" dur="5.189">already been through some full-blown</text>
  <text start="3359.859" dur="5.01">chemotherapy but some other surgeries</text>
  <text start="3362.079" dur="4.141">and treatments and she just got on</text>
  <text start="3364.869" dur="3.771">report that it was packed and it was</text>
  <text start="3366.22" dur="5.129">worse it was in the lungs and it was</text>
  <text start="3368.64" dur="4.179">coming in these certain nodes and stuff</text>
  <text start="3371.349" dur="7.77">like that I&amp;#39;m a doctor but it was</text>
  <text start="3372.819" dur="9.391">looking bad um and so I just looked in</text>
  <text start="3379.119" dur="6.72">the spirit and I saw these black long</text>
  <text start="3382.21" dur="7.53">black needles and they were running</text>
  <text start="3385.839" dur="5.701">across the front of her chest and in a</text>
  <text start="3389.74" dur="3.75">horizontal line just kind of right</text>
  <text start="3391.54" dur="4.2">across the top of her heart from one</text>
  <text start="3393.49" dur="3.359">DeLong and then there was another set</text>
  <text start="3395.74" dur="3.089">there&amp;#39;s about four or five of them then</text>
  <text start="3396.849" dur="6.651">there was another set running from about</text>
  <text start="3398.829" dur="11.941">where one side of her lungs were up and</text>
  <text start="3403.5" dur="9.369">up into her collarbone area and then it</text>
  <text start="3410.77" dur="3.99">was sticking out and this one one of</text>
  <text start="3412.869" dur="5.131">them was sticking out of her skin just</text>
  <text start="3414.76" dur="7.68">in that one spot there and again to me I</text>
  <text start="3418" dur="8.4">could feel the like a lot of times when</text>
  <text start="3422.44" dur="6.3">I see sickness or things like that and</text>
  <text start="3426.4" dur="4.59">the spirit I do feel confused by it I do</text>
  <text start="3428.74" dur="5.19">feel like I don&amp;#39;t it feels like a knot</text>
  <text start="3430.99" dur="6.14">or I don&amp;#39;t know what what to how to</text>
  <text start="3433.93" dur="5.639">approach on time you know kind of thing</text>
  <text start="3437.13" dur="4.09">but I saw that a little bit sticking out</text>
  <text start="3439.569" dur="5.191">of her skin I just felt this impression</text>
  <text start="3441.22" dur="5.19">to pull it out and I just said hey I see</text>
  <text start="3444.76" dur="4.41">this thing sticking out here and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3446.41" dur="7.05">gonna pull that out and so I reached up</text>
  <text start="3449.17" dur="6.78">and pulled this thing out and I saw this</text>
  <text start="3453.46" dur="4.29">blackness come spewing out and it was</text>
  <text start="3455.95" dur="3.93">gross like it looked like like you had</text>
  <text start="3457.75" dur="3.869">popped like some kind of pus filled</text>
  <text start="3459.88" dur="4.8">thing and it was spilling out and</text>
  <text start="3461.619" dur="4.891">splattered you know stuff apologies for</text>
  <text start="3464.68" dur="3.81">the sound effect that was gross but it</text>
  <text start="3466.51" dur="5.039">was coming coming out coming out coming</text>
  <text start="3468.49" dur="4.589">out and then I just prayed you know a</text>
  <text start="3471.549" dur="3.991">blessing on her and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s what I</text>
  <text start="3473.079" dur="4.651">probably was supposed to do and then she</text>
  <text start="3475.54" dur="3.75">went to the doctor for an exam and got</text>
  <text start="3477.73" dur="5.349">examined and there was no sign of cancer</text>
  <text start="3479.29" dur="5.949">whatsoever anywhere anywhere in her body</text>
  <text start="3483.079" dur="6.24">so so that was a really cool you know</text>
  <text start="3485.239" dur="6.87">dramatic one um it but he even you know</text>
  <text start="3489.319" dur="5.01">even as you know obviously and telling</text>
  <text start="3492.109" dur="2.64">the story how intuitive it sounds like</text>
  <text start="3494.329" dur="3.93">yeah</text>
  <text start="3494.749" dur="7.73">turn turn the key or pull that thread</text>
  <text start="3498.259" dur="8.131">out for me at least it still felt very</text>
  <text start="3502.479" dur="6.85">on the edge of okay I&amp;#39;m just trusting</text>
  <text start="3506.39" dur="6.8">the holy spirit and I am trusting that</text>
  <text start="3509.329" dur="5.91">he&amp;#39;s telling me to do this rather than</text>
  <text start="3513.19" dur="3.819">well I should just do this or just do</text>
  <text start="3515.239" dur="3.81">that so those are a couple of stories</text>
  <text start="3517.009" dur="3.96">lose to me experience yeah remember</text>
  <text start="3519.049" dur="4.32">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s been my experience and I</text>
  <text start="3520.969" dur="4.32">think this experience of my friends I</text>
  <text start="3523.369" dur="5.16">had this one friend I&amp;#39;m not gonna name</text>
  <text start="3525.289" dur="7.02">his name for this particular story but</text>

  <text start="3543.079" dur="5.851">if you pull that thing off you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>

  <text start="3656.86" dur="4.95">question any kind of prophetic ministry</text>
  <text start="3658.869" dur="5.571">is Holy Spirit what do you have to say</text>
  <text start="3661.81" dur="6.54">about that because we never want to</text>
  <text start="3664.44" dur="5.71">assume that just because of a gift that</text>
  <text start="3668.35" dur="3.39">we have or an ability that we have that</text>
  <text start="3670.15" dur="5.1">we are seeing or discerning something</text>
  <text start="3671.74" dur="5.01">that we have already also heard what God</text>

  <text start="3678.91" dur="5.22">plenty of people just cause a lot of</text>
  <text start="3680.44" dur="6.15">pain and discomfort because they discern</text>
  <text start="3684.13" dur="5.7">to something and then put their opinion</text>
  <text start="3686.59" dur="4.35">about that thing out which if you know</text>
  <text start="3689.83" dur="3.27">that you&amp;#39;re doing that it&amp;#39;s not a bad</text>
  <text start="3690.94" dur="4.38">thing but if you say this is what the</text>
  <text start="3693.1" dur="5.25">Lord is saying it&amp;#39;s just your opinion</text>
  <text start="3695.32" dur="4.77">about something discerned that that can</text>

  <text start="3704.23" dur="8.879">one more request from you um can you</text>
  <text start="3709.6" dur="6.84">tell the listeners about your experience</text>
  <text start="3713.109" dur="7.5">at Disneyland and how God taught you</text>
  <text start="3716.44" dur="9.48">about the demonic through a amusement</text>
  <text start="3720.609" dur="8.25">ride yes yes my favorite stories it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3725.92" dur="4.05">good one I like a lot so um for those of</text>
  <text start="3728.859" dur="3">you who have read the book you know that</text>
  <text start="3729.97" dur="4.11">from 9 to 12 experienced a lot of</text>
  <text start="3731.859" dur="4.971">demonic torment attacks every night and</text>
  <text start="3734.08" dur="4.98">seeing scary stuff and you know even</text>
  <text start="3736.83" dur="3.94">even though I saw a lot of bad stuff and</text>
  <text start="3739.06" dur="3.96">I got increasingly bad as timeline the</text>
  <text start="3740.77" dur="3.99">real part that was hard was not</text>
  <text start="3743.02" dur="3.33">necessarily just what I was seeing but</text>
  <text start="3744.76" dur="4.079">just this feeling of fear that came</text>
  <text start="3746.35" dur="5.219">along with it and it was really</text>
  <text start="3748.839" dur="5.25">well mning but when I was twelve went to</text>
  <text start="3751.569" dur="3.9">a church that knew about the prophetic</text>
  <text start="3754.089" dur="2.551">and at least had a there was no one else</text>
  <text start="3755.469" dur="2.701">there who saw in the spirit the way that</text>
  <text start="3756.64" dur="3.659">I did it but they at least had a context</text>
  <text start="3758.17" dur="6.389">for it and so as soon as I discovered</text>
  <text start="3760.299" dur="5.97">that what I had was a gift and had you</text>
  <text start="3764.559" dur="3.361">know discovering that also gave me the</text>
  <text start="3766.269" dur="3.661">courage to really tell my family what</text>
  <text start="3767.92" dur="3.899">was going on because I had been not</text>
  <text start="3769.93" dur="4.649">really letting them into all of it just</text>
  <text start="3771.819" dur="3.361">because that was just didn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="3774.579" dur="3.51">it myself</text>
  <text start="3775.18" dur="4.619">um that that fear stuff broke completely</text>
  <text start="3778.089" dur="3.39">and even though over the over the course</text>
  <text start="3779.799" dur="3.151">of one week and even in that week it</text>
  <text start="3781.479" dur="5.61">didn&amp;#39;t have any of the sting that it</text>
  <text start="3782.95" dur="5.879">used to um now be it would still try to</text>
  <text start="3787.089" dur="4.71">come back like once every six months</text>
  <text start="3788.829" dur="5.49">once every year so but you know either</text>
  <text start="3791.799" dur="5.52">through praying or just even sometimes</text>
  <text start="3794.319" dur="5.67">choosing just not to engage with it I am</text>
  <text start="3797.319" dur="4.74">I would you know overcome that and it</text>
  <text start="3799.989" dur="5.85">would never last longer for one maybe</text>
  <text start="3802.059" dur="5.25">two nights at the most but even at that</text>
  <text start="3805.839" dur="3.45">point there was sometimes I would run</text>
  <text start="3807.309" dur="3.72">into something not because of my</text>
  <text start="3809.289" dur="3.72">experience like never really liked</text>
  <text start="3811.029" dur="3.54">horror movies or you know most scary</text>
  <text start="3813.009" dur="5.61">things just because it wouldn&amp;#39;t trigger</text>
  <text start="3814.569" dur="4.98">those feelings again yes but sometimes</text>
  <text start="3818.619" dur="3.061">every now and again there would be</text>
  <text start="3819.549" dur="3.99">something that triggers that feeling</text>
  <text start="3821.68" dur="3.48">that would otherwise not necessarily be</text>
  <text start="3823.539" dur="3.57">relate you know horror movie that&amp;#39;s kind</text>
  <text start="3825.16" dur="3.899">of obvious but something that is just</text>
  <text start="3827.109" dur="4.831">not directly related but still triggers</text>
  <text start="3829.059" dur="5.04">that feeling and so this one time I</text>
  <text start="3831.94" dur="3.059">discovered this when we went to</text>
  <text start="3834.099" dur="3.091">Disneyland</text>
  <text start="3834.999" dur="5.04">now we lived in Southern California and</text>
  <text start="3837.19" dur="4.23">when you&amp;#39;re a local resident you can get</text>
  <text start="3840.039" dur="4.53">like season passes and things like that</text>
  <text start="3841.42" dur="4.919">for very inexpensive and so I was</text>
  <text start="3844.569" dur="3.331">home-schooled at the time so rather than</text>
  <text start="3846.339" dur="3.99">you know doing PE or things like that we</text>
  <text start="3847.9" dur="6.629">went to Disneyland all the time which is</text>
  <text start="3850.329" dur="5.64">a great plan so and especially once I</text>
  <text start="3854.529" dur="2.97">had a car you know I could take my</text>
  <text start="3855.969" dur="3.78">sister&amp;#39;s regularly and you know since we</text>
  <text start="3857.499" dur="4.171">lived about 15 20 minutes away we could</text>
  <text start="3859.749" dur="3.6">just drive go on a couple ride and go</text>
  <text start="3861.67" dur="4.049">home because my beats me relatively</text>
  <text start="3863.349" dur="5.19">inexpensive passes and my favorite ride</text>
  <text start="3865.719" dur="5.34">at Disneyland without questions the is</text>
  <text start="3868.539" dur="4.351">the Indiana Jones ride super cool I was</text>
  <text start="3871.059" dur="4.141">like the Indiana Jones movies when I was</text>
  <text start="3872.89" dur="4.109">a kid it&amp;#39;s a big crazy temple and</text>
  <text start="3875.2" dur="5.53">everything this big Jeep and bounce</text>
  <text start="3876.999" dur="6.651">around musics playing you know</text>
  <text start="3880.73" dur="5.83">you know all the other fun stuff and but</text>
  <text start="3883.65" dur="5.88">there was this one spot on the ride that</text>
  <text start="3886.56" dur="5.61">would always just freak me out it it</text>
  <text start="3889.53" dur="5.64">would just totally trigger the exact</text>
  <text start="3892.17" dur="4.17">same feelings that I had and if if you</text>
  <text start="3895.17" dur="3.63">ever been on the ride it&amp;#39;s towards the</text>
  <text start="3896.34" dur="4.5">end and there&amp;#39;s this you know you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3898.8" dur="4.59">having a little adventure on this Jeep</text>
  <text start="3900.84" dur="4.98">and your Jeep you know quote um</text>
  <text start="3903.39" dur="5.82">steer quotes here breaks down in front</text>
  <text start="3905.82" dur="5.37">of this very large snake and the snake</text>
  <text start="3909.21" dur="3.57">kind of lunges at the car the car lunges</text>
  <text start="3911.19" dur="3.87">at the snake and then you know zip off</text>
  <text start="3912.78" dur="4.05">to safety and you know again I was</text>
  <text start="3915.06" dur="5.16">sixteen seventeen eighteen years old and</text>
  <text start="3916.83" dur="6.36">so I knew this was a ride I knew this</text>
  <text start="3920.22" dur="4.23">was fake but forever reason every time</text>
  <text start="3923.19" dur="2.97">we&amp;#39;d come around to that snake it would</text>
  <text start="3924.45" dur="4.34">just really trigger that feeling of</text>
  <text start="3926.16" dur="5.04">finger and I&amp;#39;d have to close my eyes and</text>
  <text start="3928.79" dur="4.33">like I said we&amp;#39;d go all the time and</text>
  <text start="3931.2" dur="4.8">this was my favorite ride despite that</text>
  <text start="3933.12" dur="4.92">one part and so every single time I</text>
  <text start="3936" dur="3.81">would be you know I would be convinced</text>
  <text start="3938.04" dur="3.24">this time I&amp;#39;m gonna keep mine this time</text>
  <text start="3939.81" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m gonna keep my eyes open up the snake</text>
  <text start="3941.28" dur="3.6">part I would loop around the corner</text>
  <text start="3943.05" dur="3.72">where the snake was I catch that the</text>
  <text start="3944.88" dur="3.54">look of the snake for one second oh no</text>
  <text start="3946.77" dur="4.86">no close my eyes close my eyes I see</text>
  <text start="3948.42" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t forget it maybe next time and this</text>
  <text start="3951.63" dur="4.29">would happen again I can&amp;#39;t even tell you</text>
  <text start="3953.46" dur="4.32">how many times I would alright I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="3955.92" dur="2.85">to multiple times in a day cuz you know</text>
  <text start="3957.78" dur="3.69">we deal in the middle the day when</text>
  <text start="3958.77" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;re a few minds I would get to that</text>
  <text start="3961.47" dur="4.17">spot all right this time I&amp;#39;m for sure</text>
  <text start="3963.36" dur="4.32">I&amp;#39;m keeping my eyes open and nope too</text>

  <text start="4118.97" dur="3.93">ride but I would shop to how different</text>
  <text start="4121.22" dur="3.21">looked with lights on you could see that</text>
  <text start="4122.9" dur="2.7">you were just in a big warehouse and</text>
  <text start="4124.43" dur="4.409">these are just you know standard</text>
  <text start="4125.6" dur="4.949">warehouse lights and you know I can see</text>
  <text start="4128.839" dur="3.21">the track but the genie brand I could</text>
  <text start="4130.549" dur="3.361">see the you know the volcano that you</text>
  <text start="4132.049" dur="3.691">drive past and look look pretty good and</text>
  <text start="4133.91" dur="3.449">with the lights on I realized that it</text>
  <text start="4135.74" dur="4.65">was you know literally just this big</text>
  <text start="4137.359" dur="5.101">paper mache looking volcano with tissue</text>
  <text start="4140.39" dur="3.57">paper and a box fan he needs to make it</text>
  <text start="4142.46" dur="3.81">look like fire you know</text>
  <text start="4143.96" dur="3.69">yeah it looked ok when you&amp;#39;re zooming by</text>
  <text start="4146.27" dur="3.27">you know and all the lights are flashing</text>
  <text start="4147.65" dur="4.17">and everything but it yeah</text>
  <text start="4149.54" dur="5.16">with the lights on it&amp;#39;s look silly and</text>
  <text start="4151.82" dur="5.43">so then I turned I look at the snake and</text>
  <text start="4154.7" dur="4.8">you know I could see that it&amp;#39;s made out</text>
  <text start="4157.25" dur="4.29">of just you know cheap foam rubber I</text>
  <text start="4159.5" dur="3.6">could see you know they didn&amp;#39;t even hide</text>
  <text start="4161.54" dur="3.09">it I guess these little lighting to hide</text>
  <text start="4163.1" dur="4.65">it normally but I could see the machine</text>
  <text start="4164.63" dur="5.88">that made the the snake work I could see</text>
  <text start="4167.75" dur="5.22">the hydraulics that made it function I</text>
  <text start="4170.51" dur="4.05">could see that you know the the foam</text>
  <text start="4172.97" dur="3.75">rubber was peeling away from some of the</text>
  <text start="4174.56" dur="3.69">mechanics on the on the bottom that the</text>
  <text start="4176.72" dur="4.68">when the teeth was a little bit cracked</text>
  <text start="4178.25" dur="4.95">you know this from wear and tear and you</text>
  <text start="4181.4" dur="3.09">know even the color and the paint of the</text>
  <text start="4183.2" dur="2.22">snake didn&amp;#39;t look quite as good they</text>
  <text start="4184.49" dur="2.28">must have been you know some kind of</text>
  <text start="4185.42" dur="4.76">fluorescent paint that they&amp;#39;d shown the</text>
  <text start="4186.77" dur="6.54">black bite on normally or something and</text>
  <text start="4190.18" dur="5.8">you know eventually three four minutes</text>
  <text start="4193.31" dur="4.44">later they&amp;#39;d like to go back down you</text>
  <text start="4195.98" dur="3.9">know the normal ride lights come back up</text>
  <text start="4197.75" dur="4.68">and fix whatever the problem was and we</text>
  <text start="4199.88" dur="5.22">finished the ride and from that day</text>
  <text start="4202.43" dur="6.05">forward I&amp;#39;ve been able to ride the</text>

  <text start="4219.59" dur="5.49">around especially the Monacan especially</text>
  <text start="4221.69" dur="7.46">demonic fear torment which is the the</text>
  <text start="4225.08" dur="8.34">enemy wants you to see the world with</text>
  <text start="4229.15" dur="5.41">the light just right with from his angle</text>
  <text start="4233.42" dur="2.64">where you&amp;#39;re seeing things from the</text>
  <text start="4234.56" dur="4.19">perspective that he wants you to see</text>
  <text start="4236.06" dur="5.55">them with the dramatic music with the</text>

  <text start="4248.18" dur="5.01">the right angle just the right lighting</text>
  <text start="4249.56" dur="5.96">but and we because the interesting thing</text>
  <text start="4253.19" dur="4.32">is I I knew obviously that it was a</text>
  <text start="4255.52" dur="4.99">rubber snake I probably could have</text>
  <text start="4257.51" dur="5.19">guessed what kind of machine Rams name</text>
  <text start="4260.51" dur="3.48">you know I probably could have made a</text>
  <text start="4262.7" dur="2.64">pretty good estimation about how</text>
  <text start="4263.99" dur="4.35">everything worked without that</text>
  <text start="4265.34" dur="6.36">experience but I haven&amp;#39;t yet experienced</text>
  <text start="4268.34" dur="5.97">how he worked and you know I think</text>
  <text start="4271.7" dur="3.99">sometimes we try to logically you know</text>
  <text start="4274.31" dur="3.329">convince ourselves we shouldn&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="4275.69" dur="3.57">afraid we even quote good</text>
  <text start="4277.639" dur="3.031">right correct scripture that you know</text>
  <text start="4279.26" dur="4.35">God has not given us a spirit of fear</text>
  <text start="4280.67" dur="4.759">but if that&amp;#39;s just something that we we</text>
  <text start="4283.61" dur="5.37">think is true that we have not yet</text>
  <text start="4285.429" dur="7.511">experienced and we we don&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="4288.98" dur="9.15">have we don&amp;#39;t have it we don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="4292.94" dur="7.259">revelation we have an ideal and so the</text>
  <text start="4298.13" dur="4.56">beautiful things that we we have the</text>
  <text start="4300.199" dur="4.92">light of the Holy Spirit who can shine</text>
  <text start="4302.69" dur="4.17">the light on on all of this stuff to</text>
  <text start="4305.119" dur="3.421">show you what&amp;#39;s really going on to show</text>
  <text start="4306.86" dur="4.109">you what&amp;#39;s going on from his perspective</text>
  <text start="4308.54" dur="4.29">and now that this is encouraging the</text>
  <text start="4310.969" dur="4.5">story in a lot of ways but one thing I</text>
  <text start="4312.83" dur="4.98">do like to highlight with it is I do get</text>
  <text start="4315.469" dur="4.141">a lot of people talking to me that say</text>
  <text start="4317.81" dur="3.51">well I don&amp;#39;t want to see in the spirit</text>
  <text start="4319.61" dur="4.5">because I&amp;#39;m scared of seeing the bad</text>
  <text start="4321.32" dur="4.71">stuff and you know even though I</text>
  <text start="4324.11" dur="4.859">experienced a lot of you know fear and</text>
  <text start="4326.03" dur="6.66">torment at a young age I&amp;#39;ve never once</text>
  <text start="4328.969" dur="5.581">been scared of anything that I have seen</text>
  <text start="4332.69" dur="5.73">while in the presence of the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="4334.55" dur="8.04">you know it it you know I&amp;#39;ve seen bad</text>
  <text start="4338.42" dur="7.319">stuff I&amp;#39;ve seen you know bad wings on</text>
  <text start="4342.59" dur="5.46">people or or you know the demonic things</text>
  <text start="4345.739" dur="4.351">when you when you are seated where</text>
  <text start="4348.05" dur="5.37">you&amp;#39;re supposed to be as a son as a</text>
  <text start="4350.09" dur="5.819">daughter of God in his presence you see</text>
  <text start="4353.42" dur="5.43">that stuff in a right context and it</text>
  <text start="4355.909" dur="5.46">it&amp;#39;s not this big scary monstrous things</text>
  <text start="4358.85" dur="5.42">going to get you it&amp;#39;s you can see the</text>
  <text start="4361.369" dur="7.5">mechanics you can see how this is all</text>
  <text start="4364.27" dur="6.34">mostly a show you know and so yeah I</text>
  <text start="4368.869" dur="5.79">like that story because it&amp;#39;s funny and</text>
  <text start="4370.61" dur="7.049">also demonstrates how much breakthrough</text>
  <text start="4374.659" dur="4.531">we can get just by letting the light of</text>
  <text start="4377.659" dur="4.801">the Holy Spirit shine on the things that</text>
  <text start="4379.19" dur="7.38">we&amp;#39;re seeing yeah I love that story when</text>
  <text start="4382.46" dur="7.44">I first heard that story on the podcast</text>
  <text start="4386.57" dur="6.66">on Bethel Atlanta I thought wow I would</text>
  <text start="4389.9" dur="5.43">love to hijack that story sure and now I</text>
  <text start="4393.23" dur="4.98">got you to tell it to my audience which</text>
  <text start="4395.33" dur="5.039">is cool it is it illustrates so many</text>
  <text start="4398.21" dur="3.06">amazing things about God and and about</text>
  <text start="4400.369" dur="3.151">the kingdom of darkness</text>
  <text start="4401.27" dur="4.01">you know kingdom of darkness wants these</text>
  <text start="4403.52" dur="5.31">demonic things to look bigger than life</text>
  <text start="4405.28" dur="4.089">wants us to be in fear wants us to be in</text>
  <text start="4408.83" dur="2.46">torment</text>
  <text start="4409.369" dur="4.801">I probably get</text>
  <text start="4411.29" dur="4.65">more questions from people who struggle</text>
  <text start="4414.17" dur="5.61">with fear and anxiety than just about</text>
  <text start="4415.94" dur="7.53">anything else yeah and a lot of that</text>
  <text start="4419.78" dur="5.04">comes down to part part of what helps</text>
  <text start="4423.47" dur="4.38">people do with fear and anxieties</text>
  <text start="4424.82" dur="5.64">emotional healing I have found if you if</text>
  <text start="4427.85" dur="5.79">you walk people through some emotional</text>
  <text start="4430.46" dur="6.779">healing and deal with the wounded parts</text>
  <text start="4433.64" dur="5.58">of their soul that helps deal with the</text>
  <text start="4437.239" dur="5.191">fear and anxiety and the other thing</text>
  <text start="4439.22" dur="4.89">that you you know mentioned hiss it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4442.43" dur="4.65">all about seeing things from God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4444.11" dur="6.9">perspective let the Holy Spirit show you</text>
  <text start="4447.08" dur="6.06">his perspective his truth which shows</text>
  <text start="4451.01" dur="5.61">you that you know the enemy is not quite</text>
  <text start="4453.14" dur="8.01">as formidable as you think he is he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4456.62" dur="6.39">just a lot of times just bluffing so I I</text>
  <text start="4461.15" dur="4.1">do appreciate you sharing that I I have</text>
  <text start="4463.01" dur="7.229">one last question for you</text>
  <text start="4465.25" dur="8.62">if I could ask us before we go you wrote</text>
  <text start="4470.239" dur="5.611">in your book that you would sometimes</text>
  <text start="4473.87" dur="5.25">see and this may actually may be a</text>
  <text start="4475.85" dur="5.1">couple of questions you I think you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="4479.12" dur="4.77">the one who said you have seen in</text>
  <text start="4480.95" dur="8.09">churches you have seen piles and piles</text>
  <text start="4483.89" dur="8.73">of I don&amp;#39;t remember it was gold or money</text>
  <text start="4489.04" dur="8.17">things that represented finances mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="4492.62" dur="6.72">that seemed to lay there and not be</text>
  <text start="4497.21" dur="4.56">utilized and like you&amp;#39;re in a church</text>
  <text start="4499.34" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s very poor and you see in the</text>
  <text start="4501.77" dur="6.18">spirit all these things that represent</text>
  <text start="4504.17" dur="7.29">wealth and prosperity that seem to not</text>
  <text start="4507.95" dur="5.82">be people are not apprehending it mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="4511.46" dur="4.74">you have also I think I remember you</text>
  <text start="4513.77" dur="6">talking about seeing angels carrying</text>
  <text start="4516.2" dur="5.46">vets and buckets of like oil healing oil</text>
  <text start="4519.77" dur="5.31">and things of that nature and different</text>
  <text start="4521.66" dur="8.88">church services you also remember this</text>
  <text start="4525.08" dur="7.5">gosh and you you&amp;#39;ve told me about not me</text>
  <text start="4530.54" dur="6.08">I&amp;#39;m sorry you wrote in the book about</text>
  <text start="4532.58" dur="6.87">seeing demons getting decapitated by</text>
  <text start="4536.62" dur="6.46">angels with these big swords and knives</text>
  <text start="4539.45" dur="4.66">and stuff mm-hm so can you talk a little</text>
  <text start="4543.08" dur="4.659">bit about those</text>
  <text start="4544.11" dur="6.259">things and what if any revelation God</text>
  <text start="4547.739" dur="5.311">has given you about them yeah certainly</text>
  <text start="4550.369" dur="5.411">honestly it&amp;#39;s one of the subjects that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4553.05" dur="4.23">closest to my heart I just touched on</text>
  <text start="4555.78" dur="4.649">that briefly I think even in kind of a</text>
  <text start="4557.28" dur="5.76">almost a rant in the in the veil that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4560.429" dur="4.351">actually what the core theme of the book</text>
  <text start="4563.04" dur="3.74">that I&amp;#39;m working on right now it is</text>
  <text start="4564.78" dur="5.76">about so I am excited to be able to</text>
  <text start="4566.78" dur="7.359">expand on that concept but one of the</text>
  <text start="4570.54" dur="5.369">ways that I talk about it there is you</text>
  <text start="4574.139" dur="4.83">know people sometimes ask me like oh is</text>
  <text start="4575.909" dur="5.941">it hard to see in the spirit and you</text>
  <text start="4578.969" dur="6.391">know I would say that it is not usually</text>
  <text start="4581.85" dur="6.15">for the reasons that people think you</text>
  <text start="4585.36" dur="4.47">know I hate it the worst things that I</text>
  <text start="4588" dur="3.929">say the hardest things to see for me are</text>
  <text start="4589.83" dur="4.619">not demonic stuff is not when I see</text>
  <text start="4591.929" dur="5.341">people with wounds because I can feel</text>
  <text start="4594.449" dur="4.741">God&amp;#39;s answer for all of those things you</text>
  <text start="4597.27" dur="5.67">know the the things that are the most</text>
  <text start="4599.19" dur="7.679">painful for me to see is how abundantly</text>
  <text start="4602.94" dur="6.779">God has provided for his people not just</text>
  <text start="4606.869" dur="5.071">financially but emotionally was peace</text>
  <text start="4609.719" dur="5.281">with with purpose with direction with</text>
  <text start="4611.94" dur="6.02">all of these things and and how much of</text>
  <text start="4615" dur="5.639">that abundance just sits on the table</text>
  <text start="4617.96" dur="7.09">because we don&amp;#39;t know or don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="4620.639" dur="7.591">that we can grab it and you know from</text>
  <text start="4625.05" dur="4.56">for me ultimately I&amp;#39;m giving giving away</text>
  <text start="4628.23" dur="4.4">the ending of my new book before it</text>
  <text start="4629.61" dur="6.21">comes out but if what it comes down to</text>
  <text start="4632.63" dur="4.54">for me in in the core part again the the</text>
  <text start="4635.82" dur="5.43">application of it is something that is</text>
  <text start="4637.17" dur="10.89">manifold but it the core part is that we</text>
  <text start="4641.25" dur="8.52">need to actively engage in my opinion</text>
  <text start="4648.06" dur="5.4">perpetually for the rest of our lives</text>
  <text start="4649.77" dur="7.59">with an ever-growing revelation of just</text>
  <text start="4653.46" dur="6.779">how good god is and as simple and how</text>
  <text start="4657.36" dur="4.44">easily you know most Christians if I say</text>
  <text start="4660.239" dur="4.741">God is good they will say something like</text>
  <text start="4661.8" dur="5.069">all the time you know it as easy as it</text>
  <text start="4664.98" dur="5.58">is to agree with the idea that God is</text>
  <text start="4666.869" dur="6.511">good I think that he is so good that</text>
  <text start="4670.56" dur="4.58">unless we were perpetually growing that</text>
  <text start="4673.38" dur="5.57">revelation we</text>
  <text start="4675.14" dur="6.06">will in some way form or fashion limit</text>
  <text start="4678.95" dur="7.4">our ability to experience that goodness</text>
  <text start="4681.2" dur="7.44">simply because we&amp;#39;re unaware of it and I</text>
  <text start="4686.35" dur="3.73">has a very simple practical example I</text>
  <text start="4688.64" dur="4.32">think healing is a great example because</text>
  <text start="4690.08" dur="4.41">I&amp;#39;ve prayed for hundreds of people to be</text>
  <text start="4692.96" dur="3.57">here at this point I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text>
  <text start="4694.49" dur="3.87">healings I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of it not</text>
  <text start="4696.53" dur="5.28">happen which I&amp;#39;m sure it has been some</text>
  <text start="4698.36" dur="5.91">more experience for yourself um and most</text>
  <text start="4701.81" dur="4.38">people who pursue you know supernatural</text>
  <text start="4704.27" dur="4.86">physical healing um</text>
  <text start="4706.19" dur="4.65">now every single time I&amp;#39;ve ever prayed</text>
  <text start="4709.13" dur="3.81">for someone I have seen the healing</text>
  <text start="4710.84" dur="4.11">available 100% of the time without</text>
  <text start="4712.94" dur="4.05">question it&amp;#39;s different every time</text>
  <text start="4714.95" dur="4.38">sometimes I see on my own hand sometimes</text>
  <text start="4716.99" dur="4.47">I see it on the person I&amp;#39;m speaking to</text>
  <text start="4719.33" dur="3.57">sometimes there&amp;#39;s an angel that brings</text>
  <text start="4721.46" dur="3.06">that sometimes it&amp;#39;s just flowing around</text>
  <text start="4722.9" dur="5.34">in the room so much that you can hardly</text>
  <text start="4724.52" dur="5.19">hardly miss it now sometimes I can see</text>
  <text start="4728.24" dur="3.72">the reason why someone doesn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="4729.71" dur="5.93">healed I can see at an active bitterness</text>
  <text start="4731.96" dur="7.8">and active unbelief but other times I</text>
  <text start="4735.64" dur="6.88">don&amp;#39;t see anything that should stop or</text>
  <text start="4739.76" dur="5.01">block or inhibit in this healing and it</text>
  <text start="4742.52" dur="4.02">still doesn&amp;#39;t happen and sometimes I see</text>
  <text start="4744.77" dur="3.42">a long list of things that ought to</text>
  <text start="4746.54" dur="7.38">block this healing and it does happen</text>
  <text start="4748.19" dur="7.14">and so again I most people that I know</text>
  <text start="4753.92" dur="2.43">there&amp;#39;s a person healing I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4755.33" dur="6.42">experienced some of these these</text>
  <text start="4756.35" dur="8.4">frustrations but to me if I you know</text>
  <text start="4761.75" dur="5.61">this kind of student from Johnson quotes</text>
  <text start="4764.75" dur="4.83">and concepts but like if I lower my</text>
  <text start="4767.36" dur="7.02">expectation of God&amp;#39;s goodness to my</text>
  <text start="4769.58" dur="6.9">level of experience I will I have set</text>
  <text start="4774.38" dur="3.6">the ceiling on what my experience this</text>
  <text start="4776.48" dur="4.26">is gonna be or how much of His goodness</text>
  <text start="4777.98" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m going to receive because I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="4780.74" dur="4.7">going to chase after it like there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4782.27" dur="5.67">more available you know I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="4785.44" dur="4.3">take the risk of praying for that person</text>
  <text start="4787.94" dur="3.15">I&amp;#39;m not gonna you know even for me</text>
  <text start="4789.74" dur="4.2">personally I wouldn&amp;#39;t have taken the</text>
  <text start="4791.09" dur="4.02">risk of praying like I always with</text>
  <text start="4793.94" dur="3.24">healing and things like that really</text>
  <text start="4795.11" dur="3.06">struggled with the concept of well if</text>
  <text start="4797.18" dur="2.76">they don&amp;#39;t get healed and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="4798.17" dur="4.11">gonna feel loved and that feels bad but</text>
  <text start="4799.94" dur="3.42">you know I&amp;#39;ve gotten in the place now</text>
  <text start="4802.28" dur="4.68">what it&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="4803.36" dur="5.97">I am limiting my belief and view of</text>
  <text start="4806.96" dur="4.26">God&amp;#39;s goodness if I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="4809.33" dur="4.5">do not chase after this like it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="4811.22" dur="6.48">there and even and even though that</text>
  <text start="4813.83" dur="6.03">involves taking risk I the the potential</text>
  <text start="4817.7" dur="7.29">losses weren&amp;#39;t well worth the risk and</text>
  <text start="4819.86" dur="8.07">so you know I so I think that&amp;#39;s a big</text>
  <text start="4824.99" dur="4.56">part of it is if you know I see this</text>
  <text start="4827.93" dur="4.26">with spiritual warfare all the time that</text>
  <text start="4829.55" dur="6.33">we that we view our place in the world</text>
  <text start="4832.19" dur="6.84">as being small and you know you gotta</text>
  <text start="4835.88" dur="4.44">kind of you know if you can demonic</text>
  <text start="4839.03" dur="3.72">stuff and stay within this and stay away</text>
  <text start="4840.32" dur="4.29">from that and you know now I&amp;#39;m not mess</text>
  <text start="4842.75" dur="3.84">or not you know rock the boat too much</text>
  <text start="4844.61" dur="4.59">you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll maybe get out fine you</text>
  <text start="4846.59" dur="4.59">know rather than being ambassadors of</text>
  <text start="4849.2" dur="4.65">the Kingdom of Heaven you know with the</text>
  <text start="4851.18" dur="7.89">with the weight and authority that comes</text>
  <text start="4853.85" dur="9.54">with that and so it to me it does boil</text>
  <text start="4859.07" dur="6.42">down to like if I am in a perpetually</text>
  <text start="4863.39" dur="6.03">growing revelation of God&amp;#39;s goodness</text>
  <text start="4865.49" dur="5.64">then I have set myself up internally for</text>
  <text start="4869.42" dur="3.51">a perpetual experience</text>
  <text start="4871.13" dur="5.58">I&amp;#39;m with professionally increasing</text>
  <text start="4872.93" dur="7.56">experience of that goodness yep I would</text>
  <text start="4876.71" dur="6.27">agree you know I&amp;#39;m gonna share this with</text>
  <text start="4880.49" dur="6.09">you it&amp;#39;s something that God taught me</text>
  <text start="4882.98" dur="4.83">about healing and the dynamic that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4886.58" dur="4.95">going on when people aren&amp;#39;t healed</text>
  <text start="4887.81" dur="6.78">mm-hmm so I had this dream know two or</text>
  <text start="4891.53" dur="6.6">three years ago God just speaks to me</text>
  <text start="4894.59" dur="5.46">through dreams a lot so I had in this</text>
  <text start="4898.13" dur="2.97">dream I was praying for various people</text>
  <text start="4900.05" dur="3.45">to be healed I was in the emergency</text>
  <text start="4901.1" dur="3.93">department at a hospital and his prank</text>
  <text start="4903.5" dur="3.69">prank for a doctor I think he had</text>
  <text start="4905.03" dur="3.66">arthritis in his elbow was praying for a</text>
  <text start="4907.19" dur="6.86">small child and I was praying for a</text>
  <text start="4908.69" dur="12.14">third person and in the dream I knew</text>
  <text start="4914.05" dur="11.23">that the main thing God wanted me to do</text>
  <text start="4920.83" dur="8.77">was to have the person feel his glory to</text>
  <text start="4925.28" dur="6.03">feel his presence so in the dream I was</text>
  <text start="4929.6" dur="3.42">like Lord bring your glory bring your</text>
  <text start="4931.31" dur="3.24">presence and I was praying for them to</text>
  <text start="4933.02" dur="3.8">be healed but I was also inviting his</text>
  <text start="4934.55" dur="5.37">presence so that they would feel him and</text>
  <text start="4936.82" dur="4.04">in the dream I knew I just knew that I</text>
  <text start="4939.92" dur="5.41">knew</text>
  <text start="4940.86" dur="7.47">that having them experience his glory</text>
  <text start="4945.33" dur="7.94">was the main thing he was concerned</text>
  <text start="4948.33" dur="4.94">about physical healing was secondary</text>
  <text start="4955.01" dur="4.38">people ask me you know aren&amp;#39;t people</text>
  <text start="4958.22" dur="2.82">gonna be disappointed if they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="4959.39" dur="3.84">healed all right you know is it gonna</text>
  <text start="4961.04" dur="4.08">are they gonna be you know turned off</text>

  <text start="4965.12" dur="4.8">healed if God really cared about me you</text>
  <text start="4967.73" dur="4.8">know why didn&amp;#39;t he heal me well what the</text>
  <text start="4969.92" dur="5.37">Lord has shown me is look you&amp;#39;re an</text>
