  <text start="134.94" dur="3.81">of those experiences the term sleep</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="3.689">doesn&amp;#39;t seem to fit the so-called</text>
  <text start="138.75" dur="4.53">condition because I know with all of my</text>
  <text start="140.909" dur="4.381">heart I am NOT dreaming or sleeping it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="143.28" dur="4.68">like I&amp;#39;m waking up in the spirit the</text>
  <text start="145.29" dur="4.26">first part of it is terrifying one</text>
  <text start="147.96" dur="3.06">experience I woke in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="3.15">night I looked around the</text>
  <text start="151.02" dur="3.96">because I can send something and I was</text>
  <text start="152.7" dur="4.47">wondering why I woke so fast I went to</text>
  <text start="154.98" dur="4.47">lay down put about half a foot above my</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="4.5">pillow I completely froze I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="159.45" dur="4.98">move my eyes were being forced shut and</text>
  <text start="161.67" dur="4.26">I can all the sudden feel and hear in</text>
  <text start="164.43" dur="3.66">both my ears the loudest sound of</text>
  <text start="165.93" dur="4.71">rushing water and like the combination</text>
  <text start="168.09" dur="4.77">of wind in both my ears I can sense in</text>
  <text start="170.64" dur="5.129">my doorway someone or something I was</text>
  <text start="172.86" dur="4.5">scared beyond scared then I felt as</text>
  <text start="175.769" dur="4.231">though I can feel all love joy peace</text>
  <text start="177.36" dur="4.44">were being literally taken from me it</text>
  <text start="180" dur="4.92">made the fear so intense to me because</text>
  <text start="181.8" dur="5.13">I&amp;#39;ve never felt a force so strong I can</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="4.26">feel feelings taken away from me almost</text>
  <text start="186.93" dur="4.619">literally feeling it I was scared and</text>
  <text start="189.18" dur="4.83">hadn&amp;#39;t had a sleep paralysis episode for</text>
  <text start="191.549" dur="5.19">about 16 years first episode was when I</text>
  <text start="194.01" dur="5.339">was 13 I tried to move but couldn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="196.739" dur="5.58">tried to open my eyes but couldn&amp;#39;t so I</text>
  <text start="199.349" dur="4.92">started to say in my mind Jesus three</text>
  <text start="202.319" dur="4.261">times as soon as I did I was able to</text>
  <text start="204.269" dur="4.351">move and open my eyes I looked around</text>
  <text start="206.58" dur="4.68">the room again then decided to lay back</text>
  <text start="208.62" dur="4.26">down but in the same area about six</text>
  <text start="211.26" dur="3.81">inches to the pillow I completely froze</text>
  <text start="212.88" dur="4.26">again but knowing how to stop it I</text>
  <text start="215.07" dur="4.1">immediately said Jesus in my mind and it</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="4.319">stopped almost as soon as it started</text>
  <text start="219.17" dur="4.12">filled with terror I turned the light on</text>
  <text start="221.459" dur="3.721">and called my sister and she sent her</text>
  <text start="223.29" dur="4.5">husband over so I could get some sleep</text>
  <text start="225.18" dur="4.889">the term in my opinion doesn&amp;#39;t fit the</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="3.75">experience at all I sought out answers</text>
  <text start="230.069" dur="3.301">and even got a hold of several people</text>
  <text start="231.54" dur="3.539">who say they have similar experiences</text>
  <text start="233.37" dur="4.26">and asked what they did before</text>
  <text start="235.079" dur="4.261">experiencing the condition curious as to</text>
  <text start="237.63" dur="4.109">what they have done before each incident</text>
  <text start="239.34" dur="4.38">many have said it was the first time I</text>
  <text start="241.739" dur="4.351">read a Bible or it was the first time I</text>
  <text start="243.72" dur="4.65">prayed or even it was the first time I</text>
  <text start="246.09" dur="4.92">experienced death in my family it was a</text>
  <text start="248.37" dur="4.619">close relative in most cases I have gone</text>
  <text start="251.01" dur="4.229">on to reading many experiences similar</text>
  <text start="252.989" dur="3.84">in my personal experience the first time</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="3.81">I fell asleep listening to gospel music</text>
  <text start="256.829" dur="5.19">on a cassette player Wow let&amp;#39;s go back</text>
  <text start="259.049" dur="4.651">as soon as I stop as soon as it stopped</text>
  <text start="262.019" dur="4.801">huge click those tape players used to</text>
  <text start="263.7" dur="4.98">have indeed they did I woke but it was</text>
  <text start="266.82" dur="3.81">as if my body was still asleep in my</text>
  <text start="268.68" dur="3.81">spirit woke I was listening to gospel</text>
  <text start="270.63" dur="4.65">music praising God and my mind and heart</text>
  <text start="272.49" dur="4.44">such a peace came over me that second</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="3.54">time I prayed that night and that same</text>
  <text start="276.93" dur="4.62">peace I remembered feeling or sensing</text>
  <text start="278.82" dur="4.349">came over me I sought answers because I</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="3.24">want to know why this is happening I</text>
  <text start="283.169" dur="3.601">have been told not to glorify</text>
  <text start="284.79" dur="3.63">by Satan in his attacks and that I am</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="1.89">doing so by sharing what is happening to</text>
  <text start="288.42" dur="2.16">me</text>
  <text start="288.66" dur="3.66">I don&amp;#39;t think or feel like I am</text>
  <text start="290.58" dur="3.27">glorifying him at all I think the</text>
  <text start="292.32" dur="3.54">experience has scared that people I</text>
  <text start="293.85" dur="4.92">share these experiences with pretty</text>
  <text start="295.86" dur="4.71">likely yeah Psalm 91 5 says do not be</text>
  <text start="298.77" dur="4.29">afraid of the terrors of the night nor</text>
  <text start="300.57" dur="3.93">fear the dangers of the day I share that</text>
  <text start="303.06" dur="3.57">verse or a chapter with many who have</text>
  <text start="304.5" dur="5.01">these experiences knowing reading this</text>
  <text start="306.63" dur="4.38">over me helps the terror to leave me so</text>

  <text start="327.03" dur="4.17">possibly sleep terrors this is kind of</text>
  <text start="329.01" dur="4.62">an interesting topic and I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="3.96">of people on Facebook recently talking</text>
  <text start="333.63" dur="3.12">about it so I&amp;#39;m sort of wondering if</text>
  <text start="335.16" dur="3.06">it&amp;#39;s someone broke the ice and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="336.75" dur="3.21">starting to come to the surface but if</text>
  <text start="338.22" dur="4.11">the ice is broken let&amp;#39;s crack this thing</text>
  <text start="339.96" dur="4.2">completely wide what do you know about</text>
  <text start="342.33" dur="4.08">sleep paralysis sleep terrors and the</text>
  <text start="344.16" dur="4.19">like hey million first of all I want to</text>
  <text start="346.41" dur="4.14">thank you for having me on and</text>
  <text start="348.35" dur="5.35">discussing what is a really interesting</text>
  <text start="350.55" dur="5.73">subject I&amp;#39;ve done some research on sleep</text>
  <text start="353.7" dur="4.01">paralysis and what people call you know</text>
  <text start="356.28" dur="4.38">sleep terror or night terrors</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="5.2">interestingly enough this is not a new</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="4.8">phenomenon it&amp;#39;s been around for</text>
  <text start="362.91" dur="5.4">literally as long as man has been</text>
  <text start="365.46" dur="5.72">walking the earth if you go and look at</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="4.71">the writings of ancient civilizations as</text>
  <text start="371.18" dur="4.69">early as you can find</text>
  <text start="373.02" dur="5.04">there are people that have mentioned the</text>
  <text start="375.87" dur="3.78">phenomenon of being attacked while</text>
  <text start="378.06" dur="3.45">they&amp;#39;re sleeping and being paralyzed</text>
  <text start="379.65" dur="4.14">while they&amp;#39;re sleeping it is known to</text>
  <text start="381.51" dur="4.89">every culture in the world from the most</text>
  <text start="383.79" dur="5.07">primitive to the most advanced it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="386.4" dur="4.59">well documented it&amp;#39;s been written about</text>
  <text start="388.86" dur="5.01">although the interesting thing is</text>
  <text start="390.99" dur="7.25">depending on which sources you read if</text>
  <text start="393.87" dur="8.07">you read secular literature they tend to</text>
  <text start="398.24" dur="6.28">it tend to write it off as like a</text>
  <text start="401.94" dur="3.66">psychosomatic condition that&amp;#39;s a fancy</text>
  <text start="404.52" dur="3.69">way of saying it&amp;#39;s all in your head</text>
  <text start="405.6" dur="4.8">right right right</text>
  <text start="408.21" dur="4.8">and the thing is if you don&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="410.4" dur="5.61">the spiritual world which most</text>
  <text start="413.01" dur="5.26">psychologists really claim to be</text>
  <text start="416.01" dur="3.969">agnostic about the spiritual world</text>
  <text start="418.27" dur="4.44">you&amp;#39;re certainly not going to think</text>
  <text start="419.979" dur="6.421">about things like demons or you know</text>
  <text start="422.71" dur="5.37">spiritual forces but in cultures and</text>
  <text start="426.4" dur="3.6">societies where they do understand the</text>
  <text start="428.08" dur="4.8">spiritual world even in non-christian</text>
  <text start="430" dur="7.11">cultures like in Africa and South</text>
  <text start="432.88" dur="7.129">America tribal cultures they understand</text>
  <text start="437.11" dur="6.239">pretty well that this is a spiritual</text>
  <text start="440.009" dur="4.601">reality and some of them have come to</text>
  <text start="443.349" dur="2.97">the conclusion that there are evil</text>
  <text start="444.61" dur="2.339">spirits that are attacking people in the</text>
  <text start="446.319" dur="3.811">middle of the night</text>
  <text start="446.949" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s a consensus that I&amp;#39;ve gotten from</text>
  <text start="450.13" dur="5.939">my circle of friends I first started</text>
  <text start="453.069" dur="5.011">talking about this on Facebook gosh it</text>
  <text start="456.069" dur="5.581">was probably four or five years ago I</text>
  <text start="458.08" dur="5.97">wrote this Facebook note and I mentioned</text>
  <text start="461.65" dur="3.78">sleep paralysis in the Facebook note and</text>
  <text start="464.05" dur="3.33">I shared an experience that I had where</text>
  <text start="465.43" dur="5.1">I had been attacked in the middle of the</text>
  <text start="467.38" dur="5.219">night I had had a dream and as I was</text>
  <text start="470.53" dur="4.35">waking from the dream I was suddenly</text>
  <text start="472.599" dur="5.781">paralyzed I couldn&amp;#39;t move my arms or</text>
  <text start="474.88" dur="7.2">legs I couldn&amp;#39;t talk I had this sense of</text>
  <text start="478.38" dur="6.069">intense sense of fear and I felt almost</text>
  <text start="482.08" dur="4.889">as if I net had been spread over me and</text>
  <text start="484.449" dur="5.551">drawn tight and I I just couldn&amp;#39;t move</text>
  <text start="486.969" dur="6.031">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s kind of typical for</text>
  <text start="490" dur="5.219">how this thing manifests on people</text>
  <text start="493" dur="5.159">although everybody&amp;#39;s experience is a</text>
  <text start="495.219" dur="4.591">little bit different some people report</text>
  <text start="498.159" dur="4.141">kind of a paralysis of their body they</text>
  <text start="499.81" dur="3.81">can&amp;#39;t move quite a few people report</text>
  <text start="502.3" dur="3.75">feeling like they&amp;#39;re being suffocated</text>
  <text start="503.62" dur="5.639">and they can&amp;#39;t breathe</text>
  <text start="506.05" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s common that people can&amp;#39;t speak it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="509.259" dur="4.59">like their voice leaves them and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="510.43" dur="6.06">unable to talk some people report waking</text>
  <text start="513.849" dur="5.041">up in the middle of what they appear to</text>
  <text start="516.49" dur="4.38">them as being awake but they are also</text>
  <text start="518.89" dur="4.199">aware that their body is still sleeping</text>
  <text start="520.87" dur="3.9">and their spirit is awakened there they</text>
  <text start="523.089" dur="3.961">know they&amp;#39;re in the spiritual world and</text>
  <text start="524.77" dur="4.47">their body is still sleeping the</text>
  <text start="527.05" dur="4.44">phenomenon manifested differently with</text>
  <text start="529.24" dur="5.43">different people but there are some</text>
  <text start="531.49" dur="6.69">really common I think features one of</text>
  <text start="534.67" dur="6.12">which is intense fear my wife has been</text>
  <text start="538.18" dur="5.61">attacked by these spirits it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="540.79" dur="6.86">what it is it&amp;#39;s an attack by demons or a</text>
  <text start="543.79" dur="8.42">demon usually they cause intense</text>
  <text start="547.65" dur="9.3">feelings of fear dread most people who</text>
  <text start="552.21" dur="7.5">just say it&amp;#39;s like every bit of peace</text>
  <text start="556.95" dur="5.34">and love and happiness was sucked out of</text>
  <text start="559.71" dur="5.64">the universe and all you can comprehend</text>
  <text start="562.29" dur="5.94">is intense fear and anxiety and dread</text>
  <text start="565.35" dur="4.47">and like everything just all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="568.23" dur="5.549">got as bad as you can think it could</text>
  <text start="569.82" dur="6.35">possibly be and that is a really good</text>
  <text start="573.779" dur="6.361">tip-off that it&amp;#39;s a demonic issue</text>
  <text start="576.17" dur="6.58">because I mean you and I both know that</text>
  <text start="580.14" dur="5.94">one of the agendas of the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="582.75" dur="7.02">darkness is to cause people to be full</text>
  <text start="586.08" dur="5.28">of fear and anxiety and dread and the</text>
  <text start="589.77" dur="3.569">interesting thing that I found out when</text>
  <text start="591.36" dur="4.02">I started sharing this on Facebook was</text>
  <text start="593.339" dur="4.891">as soon as I posted this note on</text>
  <text start="595.38" dur="5.13">Facebook I&amp;#39;m not joking twelve or</text>
  <text start="598.23" dur="4.35">thirteen people just showed up on this</text>
  <text start="600.51" dur="4.769">Facebook thread and said that happened</text>
  <text start="602.58" dur="4.199">to me and I said the name of Jesus or I</text>
  <text start="605.279" dur="4.111">thought the name of Jesus and boom it</text>
  <text start="606.779" dur="5.281">was gone and like this person said in</text>
  <text start="609.39" dur="6.24">their letter as soon as they said the</text>
  <text start="612.06" dur="5.7">name of Jesus the feelings of fear gone</text>
  <text start="615.63" dur="5.64">completely gone but then it came back</text>
  <text start="617.76" dur="4.86">and then again who I said the name of</text>
  <text start="621.27" dur="3.6">Jesus because it seemed to work the</text>
  <text start="622.62" dur="4.65">first time in boom it&amp;#39;s gone and that is</text>
  <text start="624.87" dur="4.56">what I&amp;#39;ve noticed with everyone that</text>
  <text start="627.27" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;ve interviewed over the years who has</text>
  <text start="629.43" dur="4.68">had sleep paralysis sleep terrors things</text>
  <text start="631.92" dur="4.62">of that nature if you are even able to</text>
  <text start="634.11" dur="4.86">think the name of Jesus many times and</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="5.04">almost every time this spirit will</text>
  <text start="638.97" dur="4.47">either relent and leave completely or</text>
  <text start="641.58" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;ll leave for a while and try to come</text>
  <text start="643.44" dur="5.13">back and if it comes back if you just</text>
  <text start="645.57" dur="4.32">use the name of Jesus that you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="648.57" dur="3.95">able to repel it it&amp;#39;s like kryptonite</text>
  <text start="649.89" dur="6.449">and Superman which is really interesting</text>
  <text start="652.52" dur="6.25">about this particular spirit I believe</text>
  <text start="656.339" dur="4.351">that spirits specialize and this</text>
  <text start="658.77" dur="3.42">particular spirit specializes in a</text>
  <text start="660.69" dur="3.48">couple of things one of which is it</text>
  <text start="662.19" dur="3.78">paralyzes people the other is it brings</text>
  <text start="664.17" dur="3.59">intense fear the third thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="665.97" dur="4.89">really interesting is it&amp;#39;s extremely</text>
  <text start="667.76" dur="4.99">susceptible to the name of Jesus you</text>
  <text start="670.86" dur="4.53">know like when you&amp;#39;re doing deliverance</text>
  <text start="672.75" dur="4.23">you can use the name of Jesus a lot on</text>
  <text start="675.39" dur="4.05">some demons and it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to</text>
  <text start="676.98" dur="4.5">really affect them but with a paralyzing</text>
  <text start="679.44" dur="3.66">spirit the name of Jesus will literally</text>
  <text start="681.48" dur="4.54">make that thing stop in its tracks</text>
  <text start="683.1" dur="5.38">whatever it&amp;#39;s doing so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="686.02" dur="4.65">and then about four as far it may be</text>
  <text start="688.48" dur="4.169">category or rank Oh demons however you</text>
  <text start="690.67" dur="4.08">want to call it as a paralyzing spear</text>
  <text start="692.649" dur="3.931">without the yeah that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="694.75" dur="3.63">what I refer to it as it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="696.58" dur="4.43">paralyzing spirit it just causes</text>
  <text start="698.38" dur="6.24">generally causes paralysis and</text>
  <text start="701.01" dur="5.019">immobility and people often report that</text>
  <text start="704.62" dur="5.31">they feel like they&amp;#39;re frozen and they</text>
  <text start="706.029" dur="5.131">can&amp;#39;t move now okay so now someone comes</text>
  <text start="709.93" dur="3.36">under this attack now here&amp;#39;s some</text>
  <text start="711.16" dur="3.78">follow-up questions to go along with us</text>
  <text start="713.29" dur="4.62">for instance the first thing comes to my</text>
  <text start="714.94" dur="5.339">mind is is this something where it&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="717.91" dur="5.4">believers let&amp;#39;s say just an external</text>
  <text start="720.279" dur="4.411">attack from a demon or can this be</text>
  <text start="723.31" dur="3">something where somebody&amp;#39;s got something</text>
  <text start="724.69" dur="3.99">going on internally that requires a</text>
  <text start="726.31" dur="3.779">deliverance or can it be both or either</text>
  <text start="728.68" dur="5.49">or what&amp;#39;s your take on that</text>
  <text start="730.089" dur="8.221">yeah my experience with this is that it</text>
  <text start="734.17" dur="6.51">doesn&amp;#39;t require deliverance and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="738.31" dur="4.89">because of some sin or it&amp;#39;s not because</text>
  <text start="740.68" dur="5.19">of some you know open door that the</text>
  <text start="743.2" dur="5.82">enemy has although I&amp;#39;m gonna anticipate</text>
  <text start="745.87" dur="5.85">your next question which is why does</text>
  <text start="749.02" dur="5.36">this seem to happen to people who are</text>
  <text start="751.72" dur="4.71">reading the Bible for the first time</text>
  <text start="754.38" dur="4.149">well you know actually what I was gonna</text>
  <text start="756.43" dur="3.899">ask was and it sort of ties in but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="758.529" dur="4.05">cuz we&amp;#39;re looking at as you said in all</text>
  <text start="760.329" dur="4.5">cultures there&amp;#39;s records of this so</text>
  <text start="762.579" dur="4.411">obviously there&amp;#39;s cultures that did know</text>
  <text start="764.829" dur="3.45">of Jesus at some point so obviously it</text>
  <text start="766.99" dur="3.089">happens to both believers and</text>
  <text start="768.279" dur="4.62">non-believers alike so there&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="770.079" dur="5.041">common thread right so to what purpose</text>
  <text start="772.899" dur="3.481">would it would be and or to what end I</text>
  <text start="775.12" dur="3.06">mean cuz they say it&amp;#39;s to instill fear</text>
  <text start="776.38" dur="3.899">but there&amp;#39;s lots of ways to instill fear</text>
  <text start="778.18" dur="3.51">as opposed to attacking someone while</text>
  <text start="780.279" dur="3.481">they&amp;#39;re sleeping for instance I mean do</text>
  <text start="781.69" dur="4.32">you see like a set purpose to it or is</text>
  <text start="783.76" dur="3.389">there something deeper going on or can</text>
  <text start="786.01" dur="4.47">you tie that in somehow yeah I think</text>
  <text start="787.149" dur="6.06">there is a purpose to it the enemy is</text>
  <text start="790.48" dur="6.12">not completely stupid although you would</text>
  <text start="793.209" dur="6.211">like to think so</text>
  <text start="796.6" dur="4.71">the enemy sometimes has some very</text>
  <text start="799.42" dur="4.979">predictable patterns of behavior if you</text>
  <text start="801.31" dur="5.399">look at how people are attacked by this</text>
  <text start="804.399" dur="4.44">paralyzing spirit that you&amp;#39;ll see some</text>
  <text start="806.709" dur="4.741">patterns emerge and the pattern that</text>
  <text start="808.839" dur="4.321">I&amp;#39;ve noticed is in interviewing the</text>
  <text start="811.45" dur="6.15">people that have been attacked by them</text>
  <text start="813.16" dur="5.609">it almost always happens when a person&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.6" dur="3.389">heart</text>
  <text start="818.769" dur="4.1">is starting to be enlightened to the</text>
  <text start="820.989" dur="4.83">truth of God in his kingdom</text>
  <text start="822.869" dur="5.921">it&amp;#39;s like very few people are ever</text>
  <text start="825.819" dur="5.31">attacked by these spirits when they are</text>
  <text start="828.79" dur="3.989">kind of in neutral about God and not</text>
  <text start="831.129" dur="3.601">really seeking the truth and not seeking</text>
  <text start="832.779" dur="3.24">the light and not seeking any further</text>
  <text start="834.73" dur="3.299">revelation about the kingdom</text>
  <text start="836.019" dur="5.19">these demons usually leave people alone</text>
  <text start="838.029" dur="6.24">but as this person reported it&amp;#39;s when</text>
  <text start="841.209" dur="5.19">you start to be interested in spiritual</text>
  <text start="844.269" dur="3.99">things you start to be interested in</text>
  <text start="846.399" dur="4.081">things like healing or deliverance or</text>
  <text start="848.259" dur="4.411">you start reading the Bible for the</text>
  <text start="850.48" dur="4.229">first time you start really getting into</text>
  <text start="852.67" dur="4.62">worship you start connecting with the</text>
  <text start="854.709" dur="4.17">Holy Spirit that is almost always when</text>
  <text start="857.29" dur="4.409">these spirits will start attacking</text>
  <text start="858.879" dur="4.71">people when I posted my facebook note</text>
  <text start="861.699" dur="5.13">and had all these people weigh in on it</text>
  <text start="863.589" dur="5.28">almost to a person everyone said it was</text>
  <text start="866.829" dur="3.031">early on in their walk with God when</text>
  <text start="868.869" dur="2.43">they were just starting to get</text>
  <text start="869.86" dur="5.159">interested in the supernatural that</text>
  <text start="871.299" dur="6.54">these attacks happened so kind of</text>
  <text start="875.019" dur="4.41">jumping on that now is this something</text>
  <text start="877.839" dur="3.451">that you would see with more experienced</text>
  <text start="879.429" dur="4.44">believers as well or are they just</text>
  <text start="881.29" dur="4.289">better at fighting in or does the demon</text>
  <text start="883.869" dur="3.72">maybe not want to tangle with somebody</text>
  <text start="885.579" dur="3.961">like that or is it basically newer</text>
  <text start="887.589" dur="3.66">believers or unbelievers or how do you</text>
  <text start="889.54" dur="3.739">see that that&amp;#39;s a good question and</text>
  <text start="891.249" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s you know a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="893.279" dur="3.85">question</text>
  <text start="894.459" dur="6.66">I don&amp;#39;t know that SIOP something I know</text>
  <text start="897.129" dur="5.731">it is I don&amp;#39;t know if the enemy doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="901.119" dur="3.69">attack people who are a little more</text>
  <text start="902.86" dur="5.49">spiritually mature and further down</text>
  <text start="904.809" dur="5.161">their walk with God or not I suspect</text>
  <text start="908.35" dur="4.049">that&amp;#39;s probably the case but I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="909.97" dur="4.14">know for certain I just know that of the</text>
  <text start="912.399" dur="5.13">people that I&amp;#39;ve interviewed who have</text>
  <text start="914.11" dur="7.349">had these attacks probably 90% of them</text>
  <text start="917.529" dur="6.06">are people who would say it happened for</text>
  <text start="921.459" dur="4.74">some strange reason right when they were</text>
  <text start="923.589" dur="4.68">starting to get interested in praying</text>
  <text start="926.199" dur="4.291">for people to be healed or learning</text>
  <text start="928.269" dur="5.25">about deliverance or reading the Bible</text>
  <text start="930.49" dur="4.469">more or getting spending more time in</text>
  <text start="933.519" dur="3.78">worship it&amp;#39;s like they there was a</text>
  <text start="934.959" dur="5.13">change in their heart in their mind like</text>
  <text start="937.299" dur="4.62">they were gonna pursue things of God</text>
  <text start="940.089" dur="2.49">more seriously and that&amp;#39;s when the</text>
  <text start="941.919" dur="3.33">attack happened</text>
  <text start="942.579" dur="6.18">it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to happen as often with</text>
  <text start="945.249" dur="5.43">people who are well in their walk it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="948.759" dur="3.211">particularly in the supernatural after</text>
  <text start="950.679" dur="1.981">you&amp;#39;ve get us to a certain place that</text>
  <text start="951.97" dur="3.869">doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have</text>
  <text start="952.66" dur="5.419">but anymore and and I don&amp;#39;t know why but</text>
  <text start="955.839" dur="4.55">that&amp;#39;s just what I what I&amp;#39;ve noticed I</text>
  <text start="958.079" dur="4.51">guess then thinking of it more</text>
  <text start="960.389" dur="4.151">demonically I guess or more spiritually</text>
  <text start="962.589" dur="4.44">minded on this on that into things I</text>
  <text start="964.54" dur="5.13">would my question would be then if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="967.029" dur="4.68">the purpose of it is meant I guess</text>
  <text start="969.67" dur="5.25">frighten you or steer you away from</text>
  <text start="971.709" dur="5.61">opening a new area in your life I guess</text>
  <text start="974.92" dur="5.31">the question is if if a demon assigned</text>
  <text start="977.319" dur="4.861">to this role is that&amp;#39;s acceptable or</text>
  <text start="980.23" dur="3.659">that fearful of just thinking or saying</text>
  <text start="982.18" dur="4.349">the name Jesus I&amp;#39;m sort of wondering why</text>
  <text start="983.889" dur="4.471">would you send that guy does that make</text>
  <text start="986.529" dur="3.271">sense like I guess I don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="988.36" dur="3.63">why would why would you go to that</text>
  <text start="989.8" dur="4.139">trouble to attack someone when you know</text>
  <text start="991.99" dur="3.779">just invoking the name of Jesus gets rid</text>
  <text start="993.939" dur="5.991">of them that easily is there any kind of</text>
  <text start="995.769" dur="8.911">purpose to that boy that is another</text>
  <text start="999.93" dur="8.74">counter-intelligence I I wish I had an</text>
  <text start="1004.68" dur="5.399">answer to that but you know if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1008.67" dur="2.76">gonna send some for attack you send</text>
  <text start="1010.079" dur="3.06">someone who&amp;#39;s strong is gonna put up a</text>
  <text start="1011.43" dur="3.3">fight it would just be odd you&amp;#39;d send a</text>
  <text start="1013.139" dur="3.721">demon that come after someone who would</text>
  <text start="1014.73" dur="4.709">fold that easily right why do you send a</text>
  <text start="1016.86" dur="5.099">boy to do a man&amp;#39;s job basically yes yeah</text>
  <text start="1019.439" dur="6.421">well and the thing is we have to</text>
  <text start="1021.959" dur="7.11">understand that among demonic spirits</text>
  <text start="1025.86" dur="5.849">there are all different ranks and orders</text>
  <text start="1029.069" dur="7.89">and different areas of specialization</text>
  <text start="1031.709" dur="8.49">and different demons have different</text>
  <text start="1036.959" dur="5.791">abilities and capabilities and</text>
  <text start="1040.199" dur="4.35">assignments and weaknesses one of the</text>
  <text start="1042.75" dur="6.419">things that just puzzles people to no</text>
  <text start="1044.549" dur="7.891">end is why they can see cancer healed</text>
  <text start="1049.169" dur="5.071">and they can see Parkinson&amp;#39;s healed and</text>
  <text start="1052.44" dur="3.119">they can see blindness healed but they</text>
  <text start="1054.24" dur="6.63">can&amp;#39;t seem to get people healed of</text>
  <text start="1055.559" dur="7.801">seizures in his book placebo I try to</text>
  <text start="1060.87" dur="6.33">remember the guys name he was a Baptist</text>
  <text start="1063.36" dur="7.08">minister who had a near-death experience</text>
  <text start="1067.2" dur="6.12">and was taken into heaven he was taken</text>
  <text start="1070.44" dur="6.27">on a tour of heaven and shown all the</text>
  <text start="1073.32" dur="5.51">different ranks and levels of demons and</text>
  <text start="1076.71" dur="4.8">he was shown how demons actually</text>
  <text start="1078.83" dur="6.16">influenced people how they possessed</text>
  <text start="1081.51" dur="5.46">them and he was briefly given a glimpse</text>
  <text start="1084.99" dur="4.47">of the spirit that causes</text>
  <text start="1086.97" dur="5.459">seizures and he said it was the craziest</text>
  <text start="1089.46" dur="6.78">thing because number one the spirit was</text>
  <text start="1092.429" dur="8.161">almost impossible to see it was very</text>
  <text start="1096.24" dur="7.47">very shadowy and had a very hard to</text>
  <text start="1100.59" dur="4.829">discern figure and after he met the</text>
  <text start="1103.71" dur="2.969">spirit that causes seizures he couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1105.419" dur="3.181">remember anything about it</text>
  <text start="1106.679" dur="3.661">he remembered almost nothing he</text>
  <text start="1108.6" dur="4.17">remembered almost everything else in his</text>
  <text start="1110.34" dur="4.86">account er in heaven but when he was</text>
  <text start="1112.77" dur="4.44">shown the spirit that causes seizures it</text>
  <text start="1115.2" dur="4.77">was almost as if the spirit gave him</text>
  <text start="1117.21" dur="5.37">amnesia and he couldn&amp;#39;t remember what he</text>
  <text start="1119.97" dur="6.42">had seen and learned about it this</text>
  <text start="1122.58" dur="5.849">paralyzing spirit I think has some very</text>
  <text start="1126.39" dur="4.14">powerful capabilities and that is the</text>
  <text start="1128.429" dur="4.98">ability to instantly paralyze you and</text>
  <text start="1130.53" dur="5.04">take away your ability to speak but it</text>
  <text start="1133.409" dur="4.681">has some definite it has an Achilles</text>
  <text start="1135.57" dur="4.53">heel and that&amp;#39;s the name of Jesus very</text>
  <text start="1138.09" dur="4.11">easily repelled by the name of Jesus so</text>
  <text start="1140.1" dur="4.65">it in one sense it&amp;#39;s very powerful but</text>
  <text start="1142.2" dur="4.49">another sense it&amp;#39;s very weak and I think</text>
  <text start="1144.75" dur="4.62">a lot of demons are like that I think</text>
  <text start="1146.69" dur="3.969">they have different areas of weakness</text>
  <text start="1149.37" dur="4.08">and strength just like humans</text>
  <text start="1150.659" dur="5.13">you know everything that God creates has</text>
  <text start="1153.45" dur="4.83">strengths and weaknesses some people</text>
  <text start="1155.789" dur="6.841">have a big weakness to things like</text>
  <text start="1158.28" dur="6.81">alcohol or drugs or lust or greed or</text>
  <text start="1162.63" dur="4.44">power we all have different weaknesses</text>
  <text start="1165.09" dur="4.41">that were susceptible to and we held</text>
  <text start="1167.07" dur="4.109">different strengths you know one guy can</text>
  <text start="1169.5" dur="4.799">stand in front of a room full of naked</text>
  <text start="1171.179" dur="4.591">women and it doesn&amp;#39;t bother him but you</text>
  <text start="1174.299" dur="4.201">can&amp;#39;t get him near a bar because they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1175.77" dur="6.539">get drunk and another guy he has the</text>
  <text start="1178.5" dur="5.789">opposite effect and I think in all of</text>
  <text start="1182.309" dur="3.271">the beings that God creates he gives us</text>
  <text start="1184.289" dur="5.161">different abilities different weaknesses</text>
  <text start="1185.58" dur="6.57">and strengths for his purposes so now</text>
  <text start="1189.45" dur="4.53">these are generally called sleep</text>
  <text start="1192.15" dur="5.279">paralysis but sometimes I&amp;#39;ve heard to</text>
  <text start="1193.98" dur="5.55">term night terrors does this process</text>
  <text start="1197.429" dur="3.511">happen only at night or have you heard</text>
  <text start="1199.53" dur="2.759">where maybe someone takes a nap during</text>
  <text start="1200.94" dur="3.63">the middle of the day and this happens</text>
  <text start="1202.289" dur="4.231">is there some significance tonight or is</text>
  <text start="1204.57" dur="4.739">it anytime that is a really good</text>
  <text start="1206.52" dur="7.019">question I think in general most people</text>
  <text start="1209.309" dur="7.531">are preyed upon by demons at night</text>
  <text start="1213.539" dur="5.551">because it&amp;#39;s a time of darkness and I</text>
  <text start="1216.84" dur="4.62">think that</text>
  <text start="1219.09" dur="4.02">people tend to be a little more fearful</text>
  <text start="1221.46" dur="4.86">at night most of the people that I know</text>
  <text start="1223.11" dur="5.61">who have had demonic attacks and demonic</text>
  <text start="1226.32" dur="4.95">visions of demons it tends to happen</text>
  <text start="1228.72" dur="5.4">more at night particularly if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1231.27" dur="4.86">young and you have fear of the dark and</text>
  <text start="1234.12" dur="4.98">that&amp;#39;s one way that the enemy actually I</text>
  <text start="1236.13" dur="4.89">think instills fear of darkness lays the</text>
  <text start="1239.1" dur="3.12">groundwork for it oh absolutely yeah</text>
  <text start="1241.02" dur="3.27">absolutely yep</text>
  <text start="1242.22" dur="4.2">laying the foundation let&amp;#39;s attack you</text>
  <text start="1244.29" dur="3.57">at night and that way you&amp;#39;ll never want</text>
  <text start="1246.42" dur="4.05">to sleep because you&amp;#39;re always gonna be</text>
  <text start="1247.86" dur="5.31">afraid of being attacked at night</text>
  <text start="1250.47" dur="4.62">I do know people who have had these</text>
  <text start="1253.17" dur="4.62">demonic attacks during the daytime my</text>
  <text start="1255.09" dur="4.89">wife has had demons attack her while</text>
  <text start="1257.79" dur="3.87">she&amp;#39;s slept in the afternoon but it does</text>
  <text start="1259.98" dur="3.41">seem to be more prevalent at night I</text>
  <text start="1261.66" dur="4.32">think because most people sleep at night</text>
  <text start="1263.39" dur="6.64">there&amp;#39;s a very interesting dynamic when</text>
  <text start="1265.98" dur="6.27">you start to go to sleep when your soul</text>
  <text start="1270.03" dur="4.74">starts to go to rest and your spirit</text>
  <text start="1272.25" dur="4.68">kind of becomes a little more active and</text>
  <text start="1274.77" dur="4.83">you start getting involved in dreams a</text>
  <text start="1276.93" dur="4.95">lot of people who travel in this spirit</text>
  <text start="1279.6" dur="4.32">report that most of their spiritual</text>
  <text start="1281.88" dur="3.96">travels happen right after they go to</text>
  <text start="1283.92" dur="4.44">sleep or right before they wake up with</text>
  <text start="1285.84" dur="4.32">people who do astral projection you</text>
  <text start="1288.36" dur="3.66">pretty much have to be asleep in order</text>
  <text start="1290.16" dur="4.23">to do that there&amp;#39;s some kind of</text>
  <text start="1292.02" dur="4.77">activation with the spirit the spiritual</text>
  <text start="1294.39" dur="4.95">world when your soul is at rest and your</text>
  <text start="1296.79" dur="4.2">your spirit is a little more susceptible</text>
  <text start="1299.34" dur="3.51">I think to the spiritual world and you</text>
  <text start="1300.99" dur="3.69">have more demonic encounters more</text>
  <text start="1302.85" dur="4.08">angelic encounters and things of that</text>
  <text start="1304.68" dur="4.32">nature it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not an easy question</text>
  <text start="1306.93" dur="4.14">answer why it happens at night but I</text>
  <text start="1309" dur="4.17">think all spiritual activity tends to</text>
  <text start="1311.07" dur="3.78">get bumped up a little bit at night and</text>
  <text start="1313.17" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s interesting because I was actually</text>
  <text start="1314.85" dur="3.36">gonna run into that what you just said</text>
  <text start="1316.74" dur="3.27">for my next question about the whole</text>
  <text start="1318.21" dur="3.72">dreaming because some people say oh it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1320.01" dur="3.42">just your imagination and you know</text>
  <text start="1321.93" dur="3.45">there&amp;#39;s a whole spiritual elements what</text>
  <text start="1323.43" dur="4.23">your imagination is there is dreaming</text>
  <text start="1325.38" dur="6">which is an element to your spiritual</text>
  <text start="1327.66" dur="5.55">being as well and to clarify some people</text>
  <text start="1331.38" dur="3.66">would say okay you&amp;#39;re just dreaming you</text>
  <text start="1333.21" dur="3.99">know it was a nightmare for instance but</text>
  <text start="1335.04" dur="3.51">I agree with you that when you fall</text>
  <text start="1337.2" dur="2.91">asleep you know your souls out of the</text>
  <text start="1338.55" dur="3">way and basically you&amp;#39;re a hundred</text>
  <text start="1340.11" dur="3.21">percent operating in the spirit</text>
  <text start="1341.55" dur="3.9">depending on where you know what and</text>
  <text start="1343.32" dur="4.02">where you&amp;#39;re doing so I think it&amp;#39;s safe</text>
  <text start="1345.45" dur="3.48">to say that when people go through</text>
  <text start="1347.34" dur="3.21">something like this as opposed to just</text>
  <text start="1348.93" dur="3.45">dreaming it&amp;#39;s all the same it&amp;#39;s all in</text>
  <text start="1350.55" dur="2.49">the spiritual realm whether you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1352.38" dur="1.98">dreaming about</text>
  <text start="1353.04" dur="2.73">you did that day or whether you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1354.36" dur="3.24">fighting demons or whether you&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1355.77" dur="3.69">held down to it it&amp;#39;s all a spiritual</text>
  <text start="1357.6" dur="3.33">engagement I guess is the way to put it</text>
  <text start="1359.46" dur="4.47">so I would definitely agree with you on</text>
  <text start="1360.93" dur="5.88">that point so when someone hears this</text>
  <text start="1363.93" dur="4.83">and they are maybe having this issue or</text>
  <text start="1366.81" dur="4.35">it starts popping up again as it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1368.76" dur="3.78">need the message that we received what</text>
  <text start="1371.16" dur="5.04">should somebody do how do they handle</text>
  <text start="1372.54" dur="6.18">this it&amp;#39;s actually relatively easy to</text>
  <text start="1376.2" dur="5.34">handle it the name of Jesus is extremely</text>
  <text start="1378.72" dur="5.76">affected when I was attacked by this</text>
  <text start="1381.54" dur="5.04">paralyzing spirit it was kind of funny</text>
  <text start="1384.48" dur="3.42">because I could not say the name of</text>
  <text start="1386.58" dur="6.12">Jesus I couldn&amp;#39;t say anything</text>
  <text start="1387.9" dur="5.22">I was mumbling I was I just couldn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="1392.7" dur="4.41">anything</text>
  <text start="1393.12" dur="7.53">this spirit took my voice away it was it</text>
  <text start="1397.11" dur="5.61">was really kind of freaking me out but I</text>
  <text start="1400.65" dur="6.21">was I was able to think the name of</text>
  <text start="1402.72" dur="6.81">Jesus but in that case I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="1406.86" dur="4.95">if my wife started praying first birth</text>
  <text start="1409.53" dur="4.68">or if I started thinking they name Jesus</text>
  <text start="1411.81" dur="4.47">but I was my wife kind of heard me</text>
  <text start="1414.21" dur="3.87">mumbling and she was sleeping it and she</text>
  <text start="1416.28" dur="3.63">woke up and she heard me mumbling and</text>
  <text start="1418.08" dur="4.38">she saw me kind of just vaguely rolling</text>
  <text start="1419.91" dur="4.83">back and forth in bed and she just</text>
  <text start="1422.46" dur="4.62">sensed that I was under a demonic attack</text>
  <text start="1424.74" dur="4.17">and she started praying in tongues boom</text>
  <text start="1427.08" dur="4.65">like that she was praying in tongues and</text>
  <text start="1428.91" dur="4.98">then eventually the paralysis left and I</text>
  <text start="1431.73" dur="4.05">was able to start talking again the</text>
  <text start="1433.89" dur="5.58">whole thing the whole thing lasted about</text>
  <text start="1435.78" dur="6.39">a minute or two maybe these episodes</text>
  <text start="1439.47" dur="5.76">typically are very brief they only lasts</text>
  <text start="1442.17" dur="5.04">I mean when you&amp;#39;re in the in a dream in</text>
  <text start="1445.23" dur="6">the spiritual world it could seem like</text>
  <text start="1447.21" dur="7.41">an eternity totally yeah I mean but in</text>
  <text start="1451.23" dur="6.21">reality in earth time they usually only</text>
  <text start="1454.62" dur="5.55">last a minute or two and like I said if</text>
  <text start="1457.44" dur="4.92">you&amp;#39;re not able to talk think the name</text>
  <text start="1460.17" dur="4.35">of Jesus I know a number of people who</text>
  <text start="1462.36" dur="3.93">they could not talk and they said if I</text>
  <text start="1464.52" dur="4.53">as soon as I thought the name of Jesus</text>
  <text start="1466.29" dur="4.17">boom that thing was gone the fear was</text>
  <text start="1469.05" dur="4.02">gone and they were able to talk again</text>
  <text start="1470.46" dur="4.5">and move again if you&amp;#39;re able to speak</text>
  <text start="1473.07" dur="4.05">the name of Jesus and just saying Jesus</text>
  <text start="1474.96" dur="4.11">name get out of here that will take care</text>
  <text start="1477.12" dur="4.2">of it but if you can&amp;#39;t say the name of</text>
  <text start="1479.07" dur="4.83">Jesus you can think the name and usually</text>
  <text start="1481.32" dur="5.13">it will respond to that have you had</text>
  <text start="1483.9" dur="3.05">heard of cases where it was more</text>
  <text start="1486.45" dur="2.57">extended</text>
  <text start="1486.95" dur="3.84">we&amp;#39;re initially saying or thinking Jesus</text>
  <text start="1489.02" dur="3.36">didn&amp;#39;t get the thing to go right away</text>
  <text start="1490.79" dur="7.38">and they had to put up a bigger fight of</text>
  <text start="1492.38" dur="7.5">any kind I haven&amp;#39;t I think every person</text>
  <text start="1498.17" dur="3.33">that I&amp;#39;ve talked to who&amp;#39;s had this and</text>
  <text start="1499.88" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;ve talked to a lot of people I think</text>
  <text start="1501.5" dur="6.51">in every case that I can think of the</text>
  <text start="1504.26" dur="6.96">name of Jesus ended the attack like that</text>
  <text start="1508.01" dur="5.73">just boom as soon as I got it out some</text>
  <text start="1511.22" dur="4.71">people have had a longer battle because</text>
  <text start="1513.74" dur="4.71">they didn&amp;#39;t know what to do I will say</text>
  <text start="1515.93" dur="4.26">that I have received messages from</text>
  <text start="1518.45" dur="4.47">people who said I didn&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="1520.19" dur="4.95">and this spirit kept attacking me night</text>
  <text start="1522.92" dur="3.98">after night and it seemed like I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1525.14" dur="3.9">know what to do and then one night I</text>
  <text start="1526.9" dur="4.03">thought I&amp;#39;m just going to say the name</text>
  <text start="1529.04" dur="4.26">of Jesus and as soon as they did that</text>
  <text start="1530.93" dur="4.56">the attack ended and they never got</text>
  <text start="1533.3" dur="3.9">attacked again yeah I mean eventually if</text>
  <text start="1535.49" dur="5.79">you figure out that the name of Jesus</text>
  <text start="1537.2" dur="5.85">has power usually the attacks end yeah I</text>
  <text start="1541.28" dur="3.95">think it&amp;#39;s pretty safe bed what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="1543.05" dur="7.17">answer to everything basically is Jesus</text>
  <text start="1545.23" dur="6.55">I think you be okay that&amp;#39;s awesome yeah</text>
