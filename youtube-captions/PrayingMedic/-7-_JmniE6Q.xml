  <text start="122.369" dur="3.901">gonna happen but I wouldn&amp;#39;t get too</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="6.72">excited about the rumors that Paul Ryan</text>
  <text start="126.27" dur="6.63">is stepping down been talking about net</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="6.391">neutrality over the last few days</text>
  <text start="132.9" dur="9.96">the FCC just made it official the Obama</text>
  <text start="137.01" dur="8.699">era changes that regulated the internet</text>
  <text start="142.86" dur="4.11">have been essentially repealed and</text>
  <text start="145.709" dur="4.321">things are gonna go back to the way they</text>
  <text start="146.97" dur="6.299">were two years ago and I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="150.03" dur="4.98">there&amp;#39;s any reason to be upset although</text>
  <text start="153.269" dur="4.05">there are people now who are considering</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="5.94">whether life is actually worth living if</text>
  <text start="157.319" dur="5.971">we lose net neutrality because they have</text>
  <text start="160.95" dur="4.92">been frightened into thinking that if we</text>
  <text start="163.29" dur="6.39">if this these regulations get rolled</text>
  <text start="165.87" dur="5.55">back that it&amp;#39;s going to give cable</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="3.479">companies internet providers the ability</text>
  <text start="171.42" dur="5.25">to throttle us and do all kinds of evil</text>
  <text start="173.159" dur="7.761">things to us a lot of hype and hysteria</text>
  <text start="176.67" dur="7.2">and there is nothing to it I believe</text>
  <text start="180.92" dur="5.26">that the it is the government&amp;#39;s place to</text>
  <text start="183.87" dur="4.259">regulate neutrality that is what the</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="3.6">free market is for we have a free market</text>
  <text start="188.129" dur="4.23">so that if you as a cable provider</text>
  <text start="189.78" dur="5.789">internet provider if you provide crappy</text>
  <text start="192.359" dur="4.35">service at really high rates you are</text>
  <text start="195.569" dur="2.79">going to be forced out of the market</text>
  <text start="196.709" dur="4.941">because somebody will come along provide</text>
  <text start="198.359" dur="6.361">a better service at a lower cost and</text>
  <text start="201.65" dur="6.64">they will and we&amp;#39;ve seen this actually</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="6.269">happen let me give you an example my</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="5.55">wife and I had been on t-mobile as our</text>
  <text start="210.989" dur="5.701">mobile provider for years we loved their</text>
  <text start="213.84" dur="5.009">customer service we also liked the fact</text>
  <text start="216.69" dur="6.139">that t-mobile when they were the number</text>
  <text start="218.849" dur="6.48">four cell phone provider in the country</text>
  <text start="222.829" dur="5.56">decided they were going to do something</text>
  <text start="225.329" dur="5.94">radical they got rid of their contracts</text>
  <text start="228.389" dur="5.641">no contracts they would do a flat</text>
  <text start="231.269" dur="5.881">monthly fee unlimited text unlimited</text>
  <text start="234.03" dur="5.25">calling they didn&amp;#39;t do a limited data</text>
  <text start="237.15" dur="5.269">until later on but when they got rid of</text>
  <text start="239.28" dur="5.97">the two-year contracts their</text>
  <text start="242.419" dur="5.53">subscribership massively increased and</text>
  <text start="245.25" dur="4.979">they became the number three provider</text>
  <text start="247.949" dur="4.53">they took increased market share because</text>
  <text start="250.229" dur="6.241">they became more competitive lower</text>
  <text start="252.479" dur="8.91">prices better service more data and that</text>
  <text start="256.47" dur="7.559">forced Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T to become more</text>
  <text start="261.389" dur="4.801">competitive so they changed their</text>
  <text start="264.029" dur="2.701">policies and they regulated themselves</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="2.76">because they</text>
  <text start="266.73" dur="5.54">had to be more competitive and that is</text>
  <text start="268.95" dur="10.29">the kind of market force that creates</text>
  <text start="272.27" dur="8.5">true neutrality in the internet so you</text>
  <text start="279.24" dur="3.93">can you can see if you just look back</text>
  <text start="280.77" dur="3.69">historically that internet service</text>
  <text start="283.17" dur="2.91">providers and phone providers they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="284.46" dur="3.45">able to kind of regulate their own</text>
  <text start="286.08" dur="3.66">things I mean they&amp;#39;re still under</text>
  <text start="287.91" dur="4.41">regulation it&amp;#39;s not like we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="289.74" dur="4.89">completely deregulated but I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="292.32" dur="5.37">that having the government with its</text>
  <text start="294.63" dur="4.62">bureaucracy trying to figure out the</text>
  <text start="297.69" dur="5.91">right formula picking winners and losers</text>
  <text start="299.25" dur="6.48">I don&amp;#39;t think is a good policy so my</text>
  <text start="303.6" dur="5.4">take on all that is I don&amp;#39;t think we</text>
  <text start="305.73" dur="7.17">have anything to worry about the Trump</text>
  <text start="309" dur="6.51">administration is all about free market</text>
  <text start="312.9" dur="5.22">competition deregulation it&amp;#39;s just the</text>
  <text start="315.51" dur="5.13">way it is and people can scream and</text>
  <text start="318.12" dur="3.96">holler all they want but I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="320.64" dur="2.67">think it&amp;#39;s a good I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="322.08" dur="2.21">bad thing I don&amp;#39;t think we have anything</text>
  <text start="323.31" dur="7.23">to worry about</text>
  <text start="324.29" dur="8.85">so just my take and remember think</text>
  <text start="330.54" dur="2.6">outside the box</text>
  <text start="336.669" dur="7.861">today I&amp;#39;ve got some stuff for you I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="341.65" dur="5.789">been following the last refuge on</text>
  <text start="344.53" dur="6.419">conservative tree house on Twitter the</text>
  <text start="347.439" dur="5.54">last refuge it goes by the last refuge</text>
  <text start="350.949" dur="6.06">to Sundance</text>
  <text start="352.979" dur="7.201">so conservative Tree House Sundance has</text>
  <text start="357.009" dur="5.551">been doing this series of articles on</text>
  <text start="360.18" dur="4.75">what is going on inside the Department</text>
  <text start="362.56" dur="6.18">of Justice inside the FBI and the Office</text>
  <text start="364.93" dur="8.609">of Inspector General and if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="368.74" dur="7.079">watching you have noticed and several</text>
  <text start="373.539" dur="7.261">people in Congress have made the</text>
  <text start="375.819" dur="7.701">observation that we have had like so</text>
  <text start="380.8" dur="8.789">many more congressional hearings</text>
  <text start="383.52" dur="9.179">Intelligence Judiciary hearings over the</text>
  <text start="389.589" dur="6.961">last since the president was elected</text>
  <text start="392.699" dur="5.921">basically since January inaugurated then</text>
  <text start="396.55" dur="3.839">we&amp;#39;ve ever had in the past there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="398.62" dur="4.949">of these public hearings and we never</text>
  <text start="400.389" dur="7.65">used to have these kinds of hearings so</text>
  <text start="403.569" dur="6.301">if you&amp;#39;re looking at these hearings you</text>
  <text start="408.039" dur="4.86">need to put on your critical thinking</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="7.44">cap and ask yourself why are we having</text>
  <text start="412.899" dur="6.51">all these hearings now some people and I</text>
  <text start="417.31" dur="4.379">have been guilty of this some people</text>
  <text start="419.409" dur="4.53">would say that these hearings don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="421.689" dur="4.051">really serve much purpose that there are</text>
  <text start="423.939" dur="3.6">a waste of time a waste of energy a</text>
  <text start="425.74" dur="4.349">waste of taxpayer money they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="427.539" dur="5.43">accomplishing anything it&amp;#39;s very easy to</text>
  <text start="430.089" dur="5.521">take that perspective but I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="432.969" dur="6.211">that&amp;#39;s the case I think there is a</text>
  <text start="435.61" dur="6.14">hidden not so obvious purpose to these</text>
  <text start="439.18" dur="5.519">hearings that we don&amp;#39;t know about and</text>
  <text start="441.75" dur="5.68">Sundance figured it out and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="444.699" dur="7.231">explain to you Sundance&amp;#39;s theory about</text>
  <text start="447.43" dur="8.759">why we&amp;#39;re having all these hearings all</text>
  <text start="451.93" dur="6.539">right there is a purpose for these</text>
  <text start="456.189" dur="4.82">hearings and it&amp;#39;s not what you think it</text>
  <text start="458.469" dur="6.93">is there&amp;#39;s something else going on</text>
  <text start="461.009" dur="7.66">president Trump remarked and I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="465.399" dur="5.101">to Sundance&amp;#39;s article it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="468.669" dur="4.831">conservative Treehouse the article is</text>
  <text start="470.5" dur="4.5">an investigative pattern emerges it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="473.5" dur="5.37">my Twitter timeline if you wanna go look</text>
  <text start="475" dur="6.27">at it you can search for it so the title</text>
  <text start="478.87" dur="4.82">is an investigative pattern emerges and</text>
  <text start="481.27" dur="5.45">this is posted December 14th today</text>
  <text start="483.69" dur="4.65">during a recent rally in Pensacola</text>
  <text start="486.72" dur="5.8">President Trump</text>
  <text start="488.34" dur="7.3">remarked off-the-cuff we have a rigged</text>
  <text start="492.52" dur="5.67">system we really do we have a rigged</text>
  <text start="495.64" dur="6.51">system but we&amp;#39;re working hard to change</text>
  <text start="498.19" dur="5.49">it this was kind of out of the blue it</text>
  <text start="502.15" dur="4.14">was just a little statement all by</text>
  <text start="503.68" dur="4.5">itself away from everything else not</text>
  <text start="506.29" dur="3.33">unlike the statement that Trump made</text>
  <text start="508.18" dur="6.33">when he was gathered gathered with the</text>
  <text start="509.62" dur="9.87">military families and he said out of the</text>
  <text start="514.51" dur="7.17">blue unprovoked by anything he said you</text>
  <text start="519.49" dur="4.8">know what this is like it&amp;#39;s like the</text>
  <text start="521.68" dur="5.7">calm before the storm an isolated</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="4.26">statement that was unprovoked and people</text>
  <text start="527.38" dur="3.93">are scratching their heads like okay</text>
  <text start="528.55" dur="6.3">what does that mean well Sundance is</text>
  <text start="531.31" dur="6.51">saying that this statement by Trump is a</text>
  <text start="534.85" dur="5.64">signal that it is telling us something</text>
  <text start="537.82" dur="5.94">we need to focus on we have a rigged</text>
  <text start="540.49" dur="7.86">system we really do and we&amp;#39;re working</text>
  <text start="543.76" dur="9">hard to change it he is telling us I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="548.35" dur="7.98">aware that we have a rigged system we</text>
  <text start="552.76" dur="5.67">have people working on it they are doing</text>
  <text start="556.33" dur="5.13">the best that they can they&amp;#39;re doing all</text>
  <text start="558.43" dur="8.94">the things necessary to change it to fix</text>
  <text start="561.46" dur="9">it that is what he&amp;#39;s telling us we are</text>
  <text start="567.37" dur="5.61">in the middle of the storm and Trump has</text>
  <text start="570.46" dur="4.56">mechanics inside of this thing and</text>
  <text start="572.98" dur="4.95">they&amp;#39;re fixing it so we&amp;#39;re gonna explain</text>
  <text start="575.02" dur="4.91">what he&amp;#39;s doing and what&amp;#39;s going on all</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="6.54">right</text>
  <text start="579.93" dur="6.4">so against the backdrop of recent</text>
  <text start="584.47" dur="2.88">revelations with the stunning</text>
  <text start="586.33" dur="3.96">politicization</text>
  <text start="587.35" dur="5.85">of the FBI and DOJ these words ring a</text>
  <text start="590.29" dur="4.71">note of truth and also caution over the</text>
  <text start="593.2" dur="3.84">past two weeks we&amp;#39;ve seen releases from</text>
  <text start="595" dur="5.01">the Department of Justice Office of</text>
  <text start="597.04" dur="4.83">Inspector General that appeared to be</text>
  <text start="600.01" dur="3.93">building toward a much more</text>
  <text start="601.87" dur="5.71">consequential outcome</text>
  <text start="603.94" dur="5.5">the corruption is jaw-dropping the very</text>
  <text start="607.58" dur="5.97">heart of the US system of law and</text>
  <text start="609.44" dur="6.75">justice is now being questioned right so</text>
  <text start="613.55" dur="5.97">we know the tweet Trump tweeted up the</text>
  <text start="616.19" dur="5.7">FBI is in tatters sallie eights Eric</text>

  <text start="629.93" dur="7.89">saying no the FBI is a mess and it needs</text>
  <text start="633.44" dur="9.06">to be cleaned up so we have this little</text>
  <text start="637.82" dur="6.829">war going on Sundance goes on I would</text>
  <text start="642.5" dur="4.83">argue that the Inspector General</text>
  <text start="644.649" dur="4.481">obviously understands the need for</text>
  <text start="647.33" dur="5.9">caution within these discoveries and</text>

  <text start="663.95" dur="6.12">of an investigation of such consequence</text>
  <text start="666.279" dur="6.761">how would you introduce the findings to</text>

  <text start="673.04" dur="4.35">the releases from the Inspector</text>
  <text start="674.3" dur="4.89">General&amp;#39;s investigation I think that&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="701.12" dur="6.81">coming from the inspector general&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="702.709" dur="9.511">office that&amp;#39;s where it&amp;#39;s coming from the</text>
  <text start="707.93" dur="6.12">information for the past year we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="712.22" dur="4.65">heard generalized terms of</text>
  <text start="714.05" dur="5.789">investigations now Sundance here is</text>
  <text start="716.87" dur="6.51">going to be is explaining that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="719.839" dur="5.731">heard generalized turns then more</text>
  <text start="723.38" dur="4.23">focused terms and then very specific</text>
  <text start="725.57" dur="4.56">terms that&amp;#39;s where this whole discussion</text>
  <text start="727.61" dur="5.099">is moving in the direction of that we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="730.13" dur="6.51">going from generalized to more specific</text>
  <text start="732.709" dur="4.891">to very specific terms so first we</text>
  <text start="736.64" dur="2.369">became kind of aware</text>
  <text start="737.6" dur="3.06">that there was an investigation going on</text>
  <text start="739.009" dur="3.06">a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t know anything</text>
  <text start="740.66" dur="3.06">about the Department of Justice the</text>
  <text start="742.069" dur="2.971">Office of Inspector General we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="743.72" dur="2.429">really know about that a lot of us</text>
  <text start="745.04" dur="3.75">didn&amp;#39;t know there was an investigation</text>
  <text start="746.149" dur="4.591">until recently because I was following</text>
  <text start="748.79" dur="4.62">somebody months ago who was kind of on</text>
  <text start="750.74" dur="4.529">top of that stuff I knew that the</text>
  <text start="753.41" dur="3.9">Inspector General had been investigating</text>
  <text start="755.269" dur="3.391">Andrew McCabe had been investigating</text>
  <text start="757.31" dur="3">combing had been investigating</text>
  <text start="758.66" dur="5.82">complaints in the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="760.31" dur="6.5">and the FBI and so that&amp;#39;s the Office of</text>
  <text start="764.48" dur="5.43">Inspector General</text>
  <text start="766.81" dur="6.55">and they have been investigating this</text>
  <text start="769.91" dur="7.82">since jet early January and this is</text>
  <text start="773.36" dur="7.979">significant because people have asked me</text>
  <text start="777.73" dur="6.58">well I have a problem with the Inspector</text>
  <text start="781.339" dur="6.331">General and their investigation number</text>
  <text start="784.31" dur="5.1">one it was initiated while President</text>
  <text start="787.67" dur="4.14">Obama was still president</text>
  <text start="789.41" dur="4.44">it wasn&amp;#39;t initiated under Trump and the</text>
  <text start="791.81" dur="4.23">Inspector General is an Obama appointee</text>
  <text start="793.85" dur="5.609">now I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s actually true</text>
  <text start="796.04" dur="6.599">I don&amp;#39;t know if Horowitz the Inspector</text>
  <text start="799.459" dur="7.05">General was appointed by Obama or not I</text>
  <text start="802.639" dur="8.421">haven&amp;#39;t researched that but somebody</text>
  <text start="806.509" dur="7.051">made the objection that the</text>
  <text start="811.06" dur="5.04">investigation was launched before Trump</text>
  <text start="813.56" dur="5.399">became president about a week before and</text>
  <text start="816.1" dur="4.96">I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this I was like</text>
  <text start="818.959" dur="4.221">oh oh hang on wait a minute wait a</text>
  <text start="821.06" dur="5.93">minute wait a minute check this out</text>
  <text start="823.18" dur="6.459">how what is the biggest problem with an</text>
  <text start="826.99" dur="6.089">investigation that is going to</text>
  <text start="829.639" dur="5.911">potentially show corruption and</text>
  <text start="833.079" dur="4.69">weaponization of the Department of</text>
  <text start="835.55" dur="5.7">Justice and FBI in the midst of an</text>
  <text start="837.769" dur="6.63">election the biggest danger is that the</text>
  <text start="841.25" dur="5.339">investigation looks political if it</text>
  <text start="844.399" dur="5.19">looks like a political hit job no one&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="846.589" dur="7.591">gonna take it seriously how do you avoid</text>
  <text start="849.589" dur="6.031">that when Trump told Hillary in the</text>
  <text start="854.18" dur="4.17">debates last year yeah if I was</text>
  <text start="855.62" dur="4.56">president you&amp;#39;d be in jail and at all</text>
  <text start="858.35" dur="5.31">the rallies people were chanting lock</text>
  <text start="860.18" dur="8.82">her up lock her up all right there was</text>
  <text start="863.66" dur="7.41">no secret that people wanted Hillary in</text>
  <text start="869" dur="4.92">jail and one of</text>
  <text start="871.07" dur="4.92">objections that&amp;#39;s been raised by legal</text>
  <text start="873.92" dur="6.42">scholars and many people is that Trump</text>
  <text start="875.99" dur="7.5">is running a an operation to try to</text>
  <text start="880.34" dur="5.43">punish his political opponent so if</text>
  <text start="883.49" dur="5.64">there is an investigation and if there</text>
  <text start="885.77" dur="8.12">are charges it can&amp;#39;t be perceived as</text>
  <text start="889.13" dur="8.01">political so the Inspector General&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="893.89" dur="5.29">investigation had to be launched before</text>
  <text start="897.14" dur="4.29">Trump became president</text>
  <text start="899.18" dur="4.5">it couldn&amp;#39;t be launched on Trump&amp;#39;s watch</text>
  <text start="901.43" dur="6.15">it had to be initiated before that and</text>
  <text start="903.68" dur="5.49">it was hit the investigation the letter</text>
  <text start="907.58" dur="2.13">went out by the Office of Inspector</text>
  <text start="909.17" dur="3.18">General</text>
  <text start="909.71" dur="6.24">a week before Trump was inaugurated it</text>
  <text start="912.35" dur="6.78">was initiated on Obama&amp;#39;s watch so no one</text>
  <text start="915.95" dur="4.83">can accuse the Trump administration of</text>
  <text start="919.13" dur="3.96">initiating is that this investigation</text>
  <text start="920.78" dur="6.15">and the investigation was actually</text>
  <text start="923.09" dur="4.41">launched at the request of members of</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="3.3">Congress</text>
  <text start="927.5" dur="5.82">they&amp;#39;re the ones who requested the</text>
  <text start="930.23" dur="8.85">investigation and that&amp;#39;s actually in the</text>
  <text start="933.32" dur="10.86">letter so with that background I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="939.08" dur="7.05">continue all right so initially we heard</text>
  <text start="944.18" dur="3.57">that there is an investigation going on</text>
  <text start="946.13" dur="3.87">and if you look at the letter from the</text>
  <text start="947.75" dur="6.72">Office of Inspector General and the</text>
  <text start="950" dur="5.91">Sundance has a links and images in the</text>
  <text start="954.47" dur="2.76">article to the letters that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="955.91" dur="3.72">referring to if you want to go there and</text>
  <text start="957.23" dur="4.41">check them out initially we became aware</text>
  <text start="959.63" dur="3.72">there was some kind of investigation we</text>
  <text start="961.64" dur="4.35">knew what the terms were they were</text>
  <text start="963.35" dur="5.16">looking into basically politicization or</text>
  <text start="965.99" dur="7.62">weaponization of the department for</text>
  <text start="968.51" dur="8.67">political purposes all right then we</text>
  <text start="973.61" dur="7.29">started to hear about names focusing in</text>
  <text start="977.18" dur="8.27">the names within the IG we find out FBI</text>
  <text start="980.9" dur="9.42">agent Peter Strahm attorney Lisa page</text>

  <text start="1010.649" dur="9.641">we are learning about these names all</text>
  <text start="1016.36" dur="7.14">right and each of these people seems to</text>
  <text start="1020.29" dur="6.21">be captured in the net that is at the</text>
  <text start="1023.5" dur="5.089">heart of a political investigation now</text>
  <text start="1026.5" dur="5.28">there&amp;#39;s bound to be more details</text>
  <text start="1028.589" dur="6.12">however those names are all likely to</text>
  <text start="1031.78" dur="5.129">face some form of congressional scrutiny</text>
  <text start="1034.709" dur="4.45">questioning and possibly criminal</text>
  <text start="1036.909" dur="3.811">charges charges that will likely be</text>
  <text start="1039.159" dur="4.14">based in part on the outlined</text>
  <text start="1040.72" dur="4.29">information with it that the Inspector</text>

  <text start="1048.189" dur="7.071">names that will come out including</text>
  <text start="1051.49" dur="6.809">people like possibly Andrew Weissman</text>

  <text start="1064.33" dur="3.9">take this Muller investigation thing</text>
  <text start="1066.46" dur="4.11">kind of put it on the back burner for</text>
  <text start="1068.23" dur="3.72">another day and we&amp;#39;re gonna get down to</text>
  <text start="1070.57" dur="4.08">looking at the Office of Inspector</text>

  <text start="1979.21" dur="9.57">higher people so Comey seems to be in a</text>
  <text start="1986.38" dur="4.919">particularly precarious position because</text>

  <text start="2007.23" dur="5.16">the FISA warrant that was used to gain</text>

  <text start="2014.76" dur="5.73">fraudulent information which seems very</text>
  <text start="2017.25" dur="5.34">likely the entire operation becomes a</text>

  <text start="2022.59" dur="5.19">now become who knew what when did they</text>
  <text start="2026.01" dur="5.85">know it and how far up the chain of</text>
  <text start="2027.78" dur="7.05">command did it go based on information</text>
  <text start="2031.86" dur="6.809">we have currently Andrew McCabe and Bill</text>

  <text start="2082.57" dur="5.13">to know because each of these hearings</text>

  <text start="2097.81" dur="6.42">think that these congressional hearings</text>
  <text start="2101.68" dur="3.78">are just a lot of waste of time waste of</text>
