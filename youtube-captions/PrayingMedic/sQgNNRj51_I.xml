  <text start="164.73" dur="5.58">lot of these issues and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="167.33" dur="6.48">start out a little bit with an article</text>
  <text start="170.31" dur="6.57">by Andrew McCarthy National Review</text>
  <text start="173.81" dur="5.679">McCarthy is a former Department of</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="7.01">Justice attorney prosecutor who</text>
  <text start="179.489" dur="8.641">specialized in counterintelligence and</text>
  <text start="183.89" dur="7.629">terrorism so I&amp;#39;m going to give you some</text>
  <text start="188.13" dur="5.51">information that McCarthy has provided</text>
  <text start="191.519" dur="4.861">it will give you a background of</text>
  <text start="193.64" dur="5.58">understanding about how FISA warrants</text>
  <text start="196.38" dur="5.18">differ from regular search</text>
  <text start="199.22" dur="6.66">and wiretap warrants how that process</text>
  <text start="201.56" dur="6.89">works and I think once you hear how this</text>
  <text start="205.88" dur="6.03">process works and you&amp;#39;ll understand</text>
  <text start="208.45" dur="7.18">what&amp;#39;s going on in our intelligence</text>
  <text start="211.91" dur="7.68">community to a much better degree all</text>
  <text start="215.63" dur="8.7">right so the first thing I want to do is</text>
  <text start="219.59" dur="7.8">ask you all to pray I received an email</text>
  <text start="224.33" dur="5.82">from a friend this morning she had a</text>
  <text start="227.39" dur="4.74">dream a few days ago and I&amp;#39;m not going</text>
  <text start="230.15" dur="3.75">to give you the details of the dream</text>
  <text start="232.13" dur="4.74">other than to say it was a dream about</text>
  <text start="233.9" dur="6.93">the president and the dream indicated</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="6.42">that the president is is in need of</text>
  <text start="240.83" dur="5.9">prayer is in serious need of prayer and</text>
  <text start="243.29" dur="5.79">she felt that the dream indicated that</text>
  <text start="246.73" dur="4.06">intercessors and people who had been</text>
  <text start="249.08" dur="4.77">praying for the president have probably</text>
  <text start="250.79" dur="4.8">dropped the ball gotten weary and are</text>
  <text start="253.85" dur="4.109">not covering him in prayer the way he</text>
  <text start="255.59" dur="4.32">needs to be covered in prayer</text>
  <text start="257.959" dur="5.341">in the dream the president was in some</text>
  <text start="259.91" dur="4.89">distress and she got a clearer sense</text>
  <text start="263.3" dur="5.81">from the dream that it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="264.8" dur="6.99">intercessors had stopped praying so if</text>
  <text start="269.11" dur="4.42">you are an intercessor or if you know</text>
  <text start="271.79" dur="4.14">intercessors or your prayer and praying</text>
  <text start="273.53" dur="8.24">person you we need to keep the president</text>
  <text start="275.93" dur="9.12">in prayer and I&amp;#39;m just gonna let that go</text>
  <text start="281.77" dur="4.71">let me share a dream with you that I had</text>
  <text start="285.05" dur="4.86">last night which I think is interesting</text>
  <text start="286.48" dur="5.89">this is just you know this these are the</text>
  <text start="289.91" dur="6.03">kind of dreams I have I I do have dreams</text>
  <text start="292.37" dur="5.4">about the President and things of</text>
  <text start="295.94" dur="3.15">national security but I also have a lot</text>
  <text start="297.77" dur="5.25">of dreams that are dreams that are</text>
  <text start="299.09" dur="8.1">personal just for me and sometimes I</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="7.95">share those dreams to help other people</text>
  <text start="307.19" dur="6.99">understand God&amp;#39;s heart so in this in</text>
  <text start="310.97" dur="7.53">last night&amp;#39;s dream yes we need to pray</text>
  <text start="314.18" dur="11.01">last night&amp;#39;s dream it was kind of an</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="11.729">interesting dream because in the dream I</text>
  <text start="325.19" dur="7.08">saw people over a period of time and I</text>
  <text start="330.229" dur="5.041">saw the mistakes that they made</text>
  <text start="332.27" dur="5.85">and I saw their errors and mistakes and</text>
  <text start="335.27" dur="9.6">things that they did that really</text>
  <text start="338.12" dur="10.56">amounted to bad judgment now I saw this</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="4.5">dream as an observer and I was watching</text>
  <text start="348.68" dur="3.329">somebody else</text>
  <text start="349.37" dur="4.59">so I have a lot of dreams like this</text>
  <text start="352.009" dur="3.901">where I&amp;#39;m an observer and I&amp;#39;m looking at</text>
  <text start="353.96" dur="4.739">somebody else and this other person is</text>
  <text start="355.91" dur="6.09">an anonymous person this person in the</text>
  <text start="358.699" dur="5.97">dream was observing other people over</text>
  <text start="362" dur="5.22">long periods of time observing their</text>
  <text start="364.669" dur="3.99">behavior observing mistakes that they</text>
  <text start="367.22" dur="5.849">made things that they did which caused</text>
  <text start="368.659" dur="10.41">problems and that person was determined</text>
  <text start="373.069" dur="7.831">not to make the same mistakes and many</text>
  <text start="379.069" dur="4.711">times when I have these dreams I know</text>
  <text start="380.9" dur="5.489">that the anonymous person that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="383.78" dur="4.949">watching in the dream I&amp;#39;ve learned this</text>
  <text start="386.389" dur="6.18">over a period of time that nonnamous</text>
  <text start="388.729" dur="6.93">person is usually me and what God is</text>
  <text start="392.569" dur="9.181">telling me is I need to learn from other</text>
  <text start="395.659" dur="9.391">people&amp;#39;s mistakes not repeat them and it</text>
  <text start="401.75" dur="4.74">will give me a blessed life if I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="405.05" dur="7.83">make the mistakes that other people have</text>
  <text start="406.49" dur="10.32">made so if that is a good word for you</text>
  <text start="412.88" dur="6.92">if that will help you in your life you</text>

  <text start="474.86" dur="5.58">judge who signed off on the FBI FISA</text>
  <text start="477.289" dur="6.451">warrant that ended up wiretapping and</text>
  <text start="480.44" dur="11.84">surveillance Lynne is the same judge who</text>
  <text start="483.74" dur="11.13">recused himself from Flynn&amp;#39;s case and</text>
  <text start="492.28" dur="7.06">interestingly enough you know there are</text>
  <text start="494.87" dur="6.81">only 12 judges on the FISA Court there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.34" dur="6.21">only 12 of them it&amp;#39;s a court it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="501.68" dur="6.989">a secret court it&amp;#39;s over at across from</text>
  <text start="505.55" dur="6">justice main at the courthouse building</text>
  <text start="508.669" dur="4.471">they call it the secret court because</text>
  <text start="511.55" dur="5.13">everything that goes on in that</text>
  <text start="513.14" dur="6.589">courtroom is classified when the DOJ and</text>
  <text start="516.68" dur="5.299">FBI go in there to get a FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="519.729" dur="6.071">they&amp;#39;re the only ones to appear</text>
  <text start="521.979" dur="7.291">everything is done ex parte which means</text>
  <text start="525.8" dur="5.94">the defense has no right to be there</text>
  <text start="529.27" dur="5.17">they show up they present information</text>
  <text start="531.74" dur="6.99">and they they&amp;#39;re asking for a warrant or</text>
  <text start="534.44" dur="7.08">they&amp;#39;re essentially and so there are</text>
  <text start="538.73" dur="5.91">only 12 judges and one of the FISA Court</text>
  <text start="541.52" dur="6.18">judges was the judge who was assigned to</text>
  <text start="544.64" dur="4.92">mike lens case and that judge recused</text>
  <text start="547.7" dur="6.24">himself and so now there&amp;#39;s this</text>
  <text start="549.56" dur="6.57">speculation was the judge who was going</text>
  <text start="553.94" dur="6.33">to hear Flynn&amp;#39;s case the same FISA judge</text>
  <text start="556.13" dur="6.959">who ordered his surveillance her</text>
  <text start="560.27" dur="4.83">selfless theater going on and you know</text>
  <text start="563.089" dur="6.301">why would why would the judge have a</text>
  <text start="565.1" dur="6.84">reason to recuse himself unless there</text>
  <text start="569.39" dur="4.02">was some conflict of interest and what</text>
  <text start="571.94" dur="6.54">was that conflict of interest well we</text>
  <text start="573.41" dur="8.73">don&amp;#39;t know we do not know this is the</text>
  <text start="578.48" dur="5.43">second tweet from Sundance judge Emmett</text>
  <text start="582.14" dur="3.78">Sullivan was randomly assigned to take</text>
  <text start="583.91" dur="5.429">over the case after Judge Rudolph</text>
  <text start="585.92" dur="6.66">Contreras to recuse himself Contreras is</text>
  <text start="589.339" dur="5.151">on the FISA Court but we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="592.58" dur="5.5">because the FISA Court information is</text>
  <text start="594.49" dur="6.77">classified you will you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="598.08" dur="5.07">who the judge was that designed the FISA</text>
  <text start="601.26" dur="4.76">warrant and actually it&amp;#39;s an interesting</text>
  <text start="603.15" dur="7.38">thing because that in Chris raised</text>
  <text start="606.02" dur="8.11">conference or meeting with Congress</text>
  <text start="610.53" dur="5.64">yesterday Jim Jordan asked hey why don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="621.9" dur="5.07">going on that way for wrong we&amp;#39;re wrong</text>
  <text start="624.15" dur="8.34">and if we&amp;#39;re not wrong then the world</text>
  <text start="626.97" dur="8.94">knows what&amp;#39;s going on so Sundance</text>
  <text start="632.49" dur="5.16">continues why am I so confident that</text>
  <text start="635.91" dur="4.26">Judge Rudolph Contreras recused himself</text>
  <text start="637.65" dur="4.29">over the FISA warrant issue well that</text>
  <text start="640.17" dur="4.5">takes us back to how the warrant was</text>
  <text start="641.94" dur="6.78">obtained the next tweet is a picture of</text>
  <text start="644.67" dur="7.05">Admiral Rogers from the NSA so all of</text>
  <text start="648.72" dur="4.68">this stuff is connected however if you</text>
  <text start="651.72" dur="4.25">really want to keep track of connections</text>
  <text start="653.4" dur="4.68">again you need to utilize time lines and</text>
  <text start="655.97" dur="3.34">one of the things that Sundance is</text>
  <text start="658.08" dur="5.46">really good at is putting together</text>
  <text start="659.31" dur="6.81">timelines he&amp;#39;ll take all of this</text>
  <text start="663.54" dur="4.38">information on these dates these people</text>
  <text start="666.12" dur="3.87">did this this is what happened let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.92" dur="5.88">line everything up on a timeline and see</text>
  <text start="669.99" dur="6.3">where it goes to where points now before</text>
  <text start="673.8" dur="6.36">we go to the time line I would like to</text>
  <text start="676.29" dur="7.35">jump into this article that Andrew</text>
  <text start="680.16" dur="10.1">McCarthy wrote and it&amp;#39;s about FISA</text>
  <text start="683.64" dur="11.34">warrants and in this article McCarthy</text>
  <text start="690.26" dur="7.93">expresses a concern that attorneys at</text>
  <text start="694.98" dur="7.71">the DOJ had years ago when this first</text>
  <text start="698.19" dur="6.36">started they were concerned that there</text>
  <text start="702.69" dur="4.35">were there was a concern it was a</text>
  <text start="704.55" dur="5.79">theoretical concern no one took it</text>
  <text start="707.04" dur="5.52">seriously and now it&amp;#39;s looking like</text>
  <text start="710.34" dur="4.5">maybe that kind of worst-case scenario</text>
  <text start="712.56" dur="4.55">is coming</text>
  <text start="714.84" dur="6.51">Sundance could be a she I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="717.11" dur="7.18">might be I&amp;#39;ve never met Sundance might</text>
  <text start="721.35" dur="6.89">be she thank you for that information I</text>
  <text start="724.29" dur="6.62">appreciate that all right so</text>
  <text start="728.24" dur="4.71">the idea that the fisa could be used</text>
  <text start="730.91" dur="5.61">against political enemies always seemed</text>
  <text start="732.95" dur="6.75">far-fetched but now it might not be that</text>
  <text start="736.52" dur="4.59">is how we start out the article remember</text>
  <text start="739.7" dur="5.28">when the great debate over the wall</text>
  <text start="741.11" dur="5.88">following the 9/11 attacks the wall was</text>
  <text start="744.98" dur="3.51">a set of internal guidelines that had</text>
  <text start="746.99" dur="5.94">been issued by the Clinton Justice</text>
  <text start="748.49" dur="7.469">Department in a nutshell the wall made</text>
  <text start="752.93" dur="6.12">it very difficult or impossible for</text>

  <text start="906.48" dur="4.47">the wall&amp;#39; theory was considered absurd</text>
  <text start="908.43" dur="5.7">at the time was that a rogue agent which</text>

  <text start="916.38" dur="4.5">this an issue of national security</text>
  <text start="918.75" dur="4.16">you would think it&amp;#39;d be easier just to</text>

  <text start="931.62" dur="3.84">back twenty thirty years ago they</text>
  <text start="933.03" dur="5.94">thought no one&amp;#39;s gonna go through those</text>
  <text start="935.46" dur="8.97">lengths to make that to try to get a</text>

  <text start="944.43" dur="4.38">we&amp;#39;re gonna I&amp;#39;m gonna break this down</text>
  <text start="945.93" dur="5.85">and explain now how you actually get a</text>
  <text start="948.81" dur="4.83">warrant all right the process of getting</text>
  <text start="951.78" dur="5.309">a traditional wiretap is straightforward</text>
  <text start="953.64" dur="6">FBI crime division agents and a district</text>
  <text start="957.089" dur="5.491">assistant US attorney right is</text>
  <text start="959.64" dur="5.19">supporting affidavit it gets approved by</text>
  <text start="962.58" dur="4.02">the US Attorney&amp;#39;s supervisors it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="964.83" dur="5.91">submitted to the Justice Department&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="966.6" dur="6.39">electronic surveillance unit and after</text>
  <text start="970.74" dur="4.5">that unit approves it the Attorney</text>
  <text start="972.99" dur="5.099">General&amp;#39;s designee signs off on it and</text>
  <text start="975.24" dur="7.02">then the assistant US attorney and the</text>
  <text start="978.089" dur="6">FBI present it to a district judge okay</text>
  <text start="982.26" dur="5.06">that is how you get an electronic</text>
  <text start="984.089" dur="7.471">surveillance warrant it&amp;#39;s a process and</text>
  <text start="987.32" dur="5.769">notice it involves FBI and DOJ you have</text>
  <text start="991.56" dur="4.919">to have somebody from both departments</text>
  <text start="993.089" dur="6.9">you can&amp;#39;t do it on your own this is</text>
  <text start="996.479" dur="5.04">important because in order for us to</text>
  <text start="999.989" dur="5.22">understand how our justice department</text>
  <text start="1001.519" dur="10.88">works it&amp;#39;s good to know how all how</text>
  <text start="1005.209" dur="7.19">these warrants are brought out okay now</text>
  <text start="1018.86" dur="6.27">let&amp;#39;s see fires a wiretap</text>
  <text start="1022.03" dur="6.76">by contrast go through a completely</text>
  <text start="1025.13" dur="6.12">different process and it&amp;#39;s much more</text>
  <text start="1028.79" dur="4.59">difficult it&amp;#39;s considered more difficult</text>
  <text start="1031.25" dur="5.76">and the chain of command is not the same</text>
  <text start="1033.38" dur="7.26">in a Pfizer request the district</text>
  <text start="1037.01" dur="5.85">assistant attorney and the FBI agent who</text>
  <text start="1040.64" dur="7.05">started the investigation they are cut</text>
  <text start="1042.86" dur="7.74">out of the process which is taken over</text>
  <text start="1047.69" dur="5.94">by Maine justices National Security</text>
  <text start="1050.6" dur="5.76">Division and the FBI&amp;#39;s national security</text>
  <text start="1053.63" dur="4.77">agents so there is National Security</text>
  <text start="1056.36" dur="4.11">Division in the DOJ national security</text>
  <text start="1058.4" dur="5.37">agents in the FBI they take it over in</text>
  <text start="1060.47" dur="5.73">other words if you assume an agent is</text>
  <text start="1063.77" dur="5.7">inclined to be a rogue it would be way</text>
  <text start="1066.2" dur="7.2">easier and less problem and less likely</text>
  <text start="1069.47" dur="6.9">be detected to trump up evidence of a</text>
  <text start="1073.4" dur="6.36">crime in order to justify in order to</text>
  <text start="1076.37" dur="5.34">satisfy the probable cause standard for</text>
  <text start="1079.76" dur="3.51">regular wiretap then it would be to</text>
  <text start="1081.71" dur="7.07">manufacture some national security</text>
  <text start="1083.27" dur="8.58">threat in order to get a FISA wiretap no</text>
  <text start="1088.78" dur="7">national rogue agent would go that route</text>
  <text start="1091.85" dur="5.97">that was the thinking back then okay but</text>
  <text start="1095.78" dur="5.61">now let&amp;#39;s consider the press reports</text>
  <text start="1097.82" dur="6.21">that have come out about the Obama</text>
  <text start="1101.39" dur="6.95">Justice Department and the FBI getting</text>
  <text start="1104.03" dur="4.31">FISA warrants against Trump team people</text>
  <text start="1108.94" dur="5.64">from the three reports that came out at</text>
  <text start="1112.1" dur="8.04">the time and this article was written in</text>
  <text start="1114.58" dur="8.08">January there were three reports at the</text>
  <text start="1120.14" dur="3.96">time one from the Guardian one from heat</text>
  <text start="1122.66" dur="4.11">Street and one from the New York Times</text>
  <text start="1124.1" dur="4.59">it appears that the FBI had concerns</text>
  <text start="1126.77" dur="4.98">about a private server and Trump tower</text>
  <text start="1128.69" dur="6.81">that was connected to one of or two</text>
  <text start="1131.75" dur="7.62">Russian banks s VB bank and alpha bank</text>
  <text start="1135.5" dur="6">and there was some pinging going on and</text>
  <text start="1139.37" dur="5.31">some traffic between these two Russian</text>
  <text start="1141.5" dur="5.31">banks and it&amp;#39;s Trump Tower and people</text>
  <text start="1144.68" dur="3.96">were kind of it was very strange how the</text>
  <text start="1146.81" dur="4.23">whole thing got picked up by some nerds</text>
  <text start="1148.64" dur="2.89">who are monitoring computer traffic and</text>
  <text start="1151.04" dur="3.55">then at way</text>
  <text start="1151.53" dur="4.11">on to intelligence community and they</text>
  <text start="1154.59" dur="9.09">were trying to figure out what was going</text>
  <text start="1155.64" dur="10.98">on well heat street describes the</text>
  <text start="1163.68" dur="7.34">occurrences as centering on possible</text>
  <text start="1166.62" dur="4.4">financial and banking offenses and</text>
  <text start="1171.44" dur="6.43">McCarthy would like you to note that the</text>
  <text start="1174.96" dur="5.16">word offense suggests the crime and</text>
  <text start="1177.87" dur="4.41">ordinarily when a crime is suspected</text>
  <text start="1180.12" dur="5.4">there&amp;#39;s a criminal investigation not a</text>
  <text start="1182.28" dur="4.59">national security investigation so you</text>
  <text start="1185.52" dur="5.55">have to keep those things different and</text>
  <text start="1186.87" dur="6.45">remember James Comey has tucked told the</text>
  <text start="1191.07" dur="4.38">American public repeatedly that</text>
  <text start="1193.32" dur="5.82">President Trump was never under a</text>
  <text start="1195.45" dur="5.76">criminal investigation in fact he said</text>
  <text start="1199.14" dur="4.74">Trump himself was never under</text>
  <text start="1201.21" dur="6.39">investigation there was an investigation</text>
  <text start="1203.88" dur="5.67">into whether or not there was Russian</text>
  <text start="1207.6" dur="3.81">interference in the election which may</text>
  <text start="1209.55" dur="6.84">or may not involve directly involve</text>
  <text start="1211.41" dur="9.99">President Trump all right the new york</text>
  <text start="1216.39" dur="6.99">times report based on FBI sources the</text>
  <text start="1221.4" dur="3.75">FBI initially determined that the Trump</text>
  <text start="1223.38" dur="4.68">Tower server did not have any nefarious</text>
  <text start="1225.15" dur="5.13">purpose but then heat street said the</text>
  <text start="1228.06" dur="6.36">FBI&amp;#39;s counterintelligence arm</text>
  <text start="1230.28" dur="6.63">sources say redrew an earlier FISA Court</text>
  <text start="1234.42" dur="4.26">request around possible financial and</text>
  <text start="1236.91" dur="4.29">banking offences related to the server</text>
  <text start="1238.68" dur="4.5">again agents don&amp;#39;t normally draw a</text>
  <text start="1241.2" dur="4.26">Pfizer request around a possible crime</text>
  <text start="1243.18" dur="5.24">so the first thing he&amp;#39;s wondering is if</text>
  <text start="1245.46" dur="5.67">there is a suspicion of a banking crime</text>
  <text start="1248.42" dur="6.12">why are they going for a FISA requests</text>
  <text start="1251.13" dur="5.88">because FISA is not a criminal matter</text>
  <text start="1254.54" dur="5.32">FISA requests our counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1257.01" dur="5.67">and those two branches are completely</text>
  <text start="1259.86" dur="8.37">different and he goes on to say you</text>
  <text start="1262.68" dur="6.87">don&amp;#39;t use FISA warrants in a criminal</text>
  <text start="1268.23" dur="6.84">action</text>
  <text start="1269.55" dur="10.91">it is very rare and it&amp;#39;s considered just</text>
  <text start="1275.07" dur="8.4">bad procedure to use information</text>
  <text start="1280.46" dur="4.61">obtained on the basis of a FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="1283.47" dur="5.38">and a criminal investigation</text>
  <text start="1285.07" dur="7.05">just doesn&amp;#39;t happen because really it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1288.85" dur="8.459">because there is such a low threshold a</text>
  <text start="1292.12" dur="7.83">low you don&amp;#39;t have to prove probable</text>
  <text start="1297.309" dur="3.931">cause in order to get this warrant they</text>
  <text start="1299.95" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t usually allow them in a criminal</text>
  <text start="1301.24" dur="4.86">investigation if you&amp;#39;re at a criminal</text>
  <text start="1304.24" dur="5.309">investigation you have to have a regular</text>
  <text start="1306.1" dur="6.689">criminal search warrant surveillance</text>
  <text start="1309.549" dur="4.551">warrant that has a high bar for probable</text>
  <text start="1312.789" dur="6.87">cause okay</text>
  <text start="1314.1" dur="9.01">so going back and this is what heat</text>
  <text start="1319.659" dur="5.22">street reported the first FISA requests</text>
  <text start="1323.11" dur="5.85">there were two there&amp;#39;s one in June and</text>
  <text start="1324.879" dur="6.78">one in October of 2016 the first one</text>
  <text start="1328.96" dur="6.15">which sources say named president Trump</text>
  <text start="1331.659" dur="5.701">was denied in June but the second one</text>
  <text start="1335.11" dur="4.86">which was drawn more narrowly was</text>
  <text start="1337.36" dur="4.769">granted in October after evidences</text>
  <text start="1339.97" dur="4.679">presented of a server possibly related</text>
  <text start="1342.129" dur="5.76">to the Trump campaign and it&amp;#39;s alleged</text>
  <text start="1344.649" dur="6.12">links to banks sv b and russia alpha</text>

  <text start="1350.769" dur="4.681">metadata source to suggest that the FISA</text>
  <text start="1353.169" dur="4.051">warrant was granted to look at the full</text>
  <text start="1355.45" dur="4.92">content of emails and other related</text>
  <text start="1357.22" dur="8.22">documents that may concern u.s. persons</text>
  <text start="1360.37" dur="7.559">okay so McCarthy goes on to say we</text>
  <text start="1365.44" dur="5.55">haven&amp;#39;t seen the FBI affidavits we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1367.929" dur="4.771">know a lot of other relevant facts but</text>
  <text start="1370.99" dur="4.439">we have however a suggestion that</text>
  <text start="1372.7" dur="5.459">someone at the FBI had a concern that</text>
  <text start="1375.429" dur="4.46">banking laws were being violated but</text>
  <text start="1378.159" dur="4.74">when the bureau looked into it</text>
  <text start="1379.889" dur="4.63">investigators found no crimes were being</text>
  <text start="1382.899" dur="4.051">committed and rather than dropped the</text>
  <text start="1384.519" dur="4.921">matter for lack of evidence of criminal</text>
  <text start="1386.95" dur="5.28">offenses Justice Department pursued it</text>
  <text start="1389.44" dur="5.099">as a national security investigation so</text>
  <text start="1392.23" dur="3.689">their initial you know gut feeling was</text>
  <text start="1394.539" dur="3.421">maybe it&amp;#39;s criminal</text>
  <text start="1395.919" dur="4.47">and then when they decided it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1397.96" dur="3.39">criminal they thought okay well maybe we</text>
  <text start="1400.389" dur="2.101">need to start a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1401.35" dur="6.84">investigation</text>
  <text start="1402.49" dur="9.659">okay national security so in June the</text>
  <text start="1408.19" dur="6.719">initial FISA affidavit was submitted to</text>
  <text start="1412.149" dur="5.071">FISA Court who is said to have named</text>
  <text start="1414.909" dur="3.631">Trump on it we don&amp;#39;t know what that</text>
  <text start="1417.22" dur="9.81">means we don&amp;#39;t even know if it</text>
  <text start="1418.54" dur="11.97">true and it was rejected five months</text>
  <text start="1427.03" dur="5.94">later Justice Department and FBI submit</text>
  <text start="1430.51" dur="5.19">a second more narrowly drawn affidavit</text>
  <text start="1432.97" dur="5.94">to the FISA Court and the way heat</text>
  <text start="1435.7" dur="8.04">street reports it suggests that Trump is</text>
  <text start="1438.91" dur="6.78">not named in this second application the</text>
  <text start="1443.74" dur="3.72">tie to Trump also appears weak heat</text>
  <text start="1445.69" dur="3.84">Street says the FISA Court was presented</text>
  <text start="1447.46" dur="4.11">with evidence of a server possibly</text>

  <text start="1451.57" dur="5.63">alleged links to two Russian banks so no</text>
  <text start="1455.59" dur="3.3">grounds for a criminal investigation</text>
  <text start="1457.2" dur="6.73">they&amp;#39;re turning it into</text>
  <text start="1458.89" dur="7.5">counterintelligence and so FBI DOJ they</text>
  <text start="1463.93" dur="7.82">go and with the counter tellers they get</text>
  <text start="1466.39" dur="8.46">the FISA warrant in October okay</text>
  <text start="1471.75" dur="8.56">based on this information now I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1474.85" dur="7.8">jump back to the last refuge thread so</text>
  <text start="1480.31" dur="5.82">and and we&amp;#39;re really good timelines here</text>
  <text start="1482.65" dur="6.09">in June of 2016 there is an initial</text>
  <text start="1486.13" dur="4.41">Pfizer request the Obama administration</text>

  <text start="1562.2" dur="4.029">monitoring associates within the</text>

  <text start="1575.289" dur="5.281">understand the potential ramifications</text>
  <text start="1576.549" dur="7.47">of surveilling a presidential campaign</text>
  <text start="1580.57" dur="6.059">that is not a small thing there&amp;#39;s huge</text>
  <text start="1584.019" dur="6.11">ramifications if they do this all right</text>
  <text start="1586.629" dur="7.74">and yes for those of you following along</text>
  <text start="1590.129" dur="7">June 2016 was when the first when the</text>
  <text start="1594.369" dur="7.56">FBI first got involved in the steel</text>
  <text start="1597.129" dur="8.18">dossier now we see where FBI deputy head</text>
  <text start="1601.929" dur="6.6">of counterintelligence Peter struck</text>
  <text start="1605.309" dur="7.271">gains additional weighted importance</text>
  <text start="1608.529" dur="5.94">okay so struck is deputy head of</text>
  <text start="1612.58" dur="4.349">counterintelligence and this</text>
  <text start="1614.469" dur="4.83">investigation and the warrant is all</text>
  <text start="1616.929" dur="5.04">counterintelligence now it makes sense</text>
  <text start="1619.299" dur="6.81">why struck was that probably the guy who</text>
  <text start="1621.969" dur="6.18">got a hold of steel got the dossier took</text>
  <text start="1626.109" dur="3.9">the information from it by the way one</text>
  <text start="1628.149" dur="5.85">of the things in the steel dossier is</text>
  <text start="1630.009" dur="6.09">the report that there is server traffic</text>
  <text start="1633.999" dur="8.28">going between the Russian bank and Trump</text>
  <text start="1636.099" dur="8.64">Tower so this is what the FBI is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1642.279" dur="5.06">looking like the FBI and the DOJ use</text>
  <text start="1644.739" dur="8.581">this information to get the warrant and</text>
  <text start="1647.339" dur="7.57">June is when struck and steel met that</text>
  <text start="1653.32" dur="2.449">is one of the scandals is kind of coming</text>

  <text start="1675.639" dur="4.16">not that it really matters but because</text>
  <text start="1678.159" dur="3.96">this was a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1679.799" dur="5.92">investigation from the beginning Strock</text>

  <text start="1754.02" dur="4.67">of the House and Senate intelligence</text>
  <text start="1756.57" dur="4.109">committees and the reason I hesitate is</text>
  <text start="1758.69" dur="3.609">thanks to feedback we&amp;#39;ve got we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1760.679" dur="4.111">trying to make it better and that</text>
  <text start="1762.299" dur="7.321">involves a briefing of the Department of</text>
  <text start="1764.79" dur="6.36">Justice I believe the DNI and the some</text>
  <text start="1769.62" dur="5.97">portion of the National Security Council</text>
  <text start="1771.15" dur="7.32">at the White House so this is to me very</text>
  <text start="1775.59" dur="6.6">interesting because she is I think a</text>
  <text start="1778.47" dur="5.76">freshman senator who is young she looks</text>
  <text start="1782.19" dur="3.89">like she was about 25 years old commis</text>
  <text start="1784.23" dur="4.41">probably thinking she doesn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1786.08" dur="5.32">anything about any of this and he is not</text>
  <text start="1788.64" dur="5.73">expecting the question that comes here</text>
  <text start="1791.4" dur="4.59">in just a minute and he does not have a</text>
  <text start="1794.37" dur="7.47">good answer for it so sit tight I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1795.99" dur="7.59">gonna keep continue so its quarterly for</text>
  <text start="1801.84" dur="4.05">all three then senior congressional</text>
  <text start="1803.58" dur="3.51">leadership the White House and the DNI I</text>
  <text start="1805.89" dur="3.81">think that&amp;#39;s right now that&amp;#39;s by</text>
  <text start="1807.09" dur="5.219">practice not by rule or by written</text>
  <text start="1809.7" dur="3.96">policy which is why thanks to the chair</text>
  <text start="1812.309" dur="4.531">and rank and giving us feedback we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1813.66" dur="5.04">trying to tweak it in certain ways so</text>
  <text start="1816.84" dur="3.48">since in your opening statement you</text>
  <text start="1818.7" dur="3.69">confirm that there is a</text>
  <text start="1820.32" dur="4.2">counterintelligence investigation</text>
  <text start="1822.39" dur="5.13">open and you also reference that it</text>
  <text start="1824.52" dur="5.1">started in July when did you notify the</text>
  <text start="1827.52" dur="6.03">DNI the White House or senior</text>
  <text start="1829.62" dur="7.26">congressional leadership good question</text>
  <text start="1833.55" dur="6.24">congressional leadership sometime</text>
  <text start="1836.88" dur="4.86">recently they were briefed on the nature</text>
  <text start="1839.79" dur="3.87">of the investigation in some detail as I</text>
  <text start="1841.74" dur="4.53">said obviously the department justice</text>
  <text start="1843.66" dur="4.5">has been aware of it all along the DNI I</text>
  <text start="1846.27" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t know what the DNI is knowledge of</text>
  <text start="1848.16" dur="4.29">it was because we didn&amp;#39;t have a DNI</text>
  <text start="1849.72" dur="6.36">until mr. Coates took office and i</text>
  <text start="1852.45" dur="7.2">briefed him his first morning in office</text>
  <text start="1856.08" dur="6.36">so just to drill down on this if the</text>
  <text start="1859.65" dur="4.68">open investigation began in July and the</text>
  <text start="1862.44" dur="5.1">briefing of congressional leadership</text>
  <text start="1864.33" dur="6.15">only occurred recently why was there no</text>
  <text start="1867.54" dur="5.85">notification prior to the recent the</text>
  <text start="1870.48" dur="4.92">past month i think our decision was it</text>
  <text start="1873.39" dur="3.12">was a matter of such sensitivity that we</text>
  <text start="1875.4" dur="3.51">wouldn&amp;#39;t include it in the quarterly</text>
  <text start="1876.51" dur="5.28">briefings so when you state our decision</text>
  <text start="1878.91" dur="5.34">is that your decision is that usually</text>
  <text start="1881.79" dur="5.01">your decision what gets briefed in those</text>
  <text start="1884.25" dur="3.6">quarterly updates no it&amp;#39;s usually the</text>
  <text start="1886.8" dur="3.3">decision of the head of our</text>
  <text start="1887.85" dur="5.61">counterintelligence division and just</text>
  <text start="1890.1" dur="5.88">again to get the detailed on the record</text>
  <text start="1893.46" dur="5.37">why was the decision made not to brief</text>
  <text start="1895.98" dur="5.31">senior congressional leadership until</text>
  <text start="1898.83" dur="5.52">recently when the investigation had been</text>
  <text start="1901.29" dur="4.68">open since July a very serious</text>
  <text start="1904.35" dur="4.68">investigation why was that decision made</text>
  <text start="1905.97" dur="8.1">to wait months the sensitivity of the</text>
  <text start="1909.03" dur="8.82">matter because of the sensitivity of the</text>
  <text start="1914.07" dur="7.37">matter we didn&amp;#39;t tell congressional</text>
  <text start="1917.85" dur="6.77">oversight about a counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1921.44" dur="7.74">investigation concerning the president</text>
  <text start="1924.62" dur="4.56">because it was a highly sensitive matter</text>
  <text start="1930.65" dur="8.92">Comey just gets destroyed by this little</text>
  <text start="1935.64" dur="5.64">testimony here so what becomes obvious</text>
  <text start="1939.57" dur="4.62">if you&amp;#39;re paying attention in all of</text>
  <text start="1941.28" dur="5.94">this and I kind of thought this is</text>
  <text start="1944.19" dur="6.72">really strange they didn&amp;#39;t want to tell</text>
  <text start="1947.22" dur="5.49">the judicial the Judiciary Committee or</text>
  <text start="1950.91" dur="3.63">the House Intelligence Committee what</text>
  <text start="1952.71" dur="3.18">was going on because they would have to</text>
  <text start="1954.54" dur="4.53">explain</text>
  <text start="1955.89" dur="5.58">all about this pesky dossier they&amp;#39;d have</text>
  <text start="1959.07" dur="5.67">to explain about fusion GPS they might</text>
  <text start="1961.47" dur="5.43">have to reveal you know what their</text>
  <text start="1964.74" dur="4.71">purpose was for this investigation how</text>
  <text start="1966.9" dur="4.08">it originated and those are all messy</text>
  <text start="1969.45" dur="8.78">details that they still don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="1970.98" dur="7.25">talk about so we&amp;#39;re gonna continue</text>
  <text start="1979.01" dur="6.97">moving along on Sundance&amp;#39;s thread number</text>
  <text start="1984" dur="5.73">13</text>
  <text start="1985.98" dur="6.75">fast forward to October 2016</text>
  <text start="1989.73" dur="6.78">that&amp;#39;s one FBI agent Peter struck and</text>
  <text start="1992.73" dur="6.57">the newly discovered DOJ associate</text>
  <text start="1996.51" dur="6.09">Deputy Attorney General Bruce or who</text>
  <text start="1999.3" dur="5.4">yesterday&amp;#39;s headline came out these guys</text>
  <text start="2002.6" dur="5.46">are outed is having conversations with</text>
  <text start="2004.7" dur="7.38">Christopher Steele and fusion GPS in</text>
  <text start="2008.06" dur="7.8">October when the FBI submitted a second</text>
  <text start="2012.08" dur="9.96">request for a FISA warrant so struck and</text>
  <text start="2015.86" dur="8.88">or DOJ FBI both have contact with</text>
  <text start="2022.04" dur="5.16">Christopher Steele at the in the same</text>
  <text start="2024.74" dur="6.12">month that FBI requests a second FISA</text>
  <text start="2027.2" dur="4.07">warrant now that is a bit of a smoking</text>
  <text start="2030.86" dur="3.42">gun</text>
  <text start="2031.27" dur="7.78">because we don&amp;#39;t have hard evidence this</text>
  <text start="2034.28" dur="8.07">is circumstantial but we know that these</text>
  <text start="2039.05" dur="5.97">two guys had contact with Steele in</text>
  <text start="2042.35" dur="5.22">October and the same time that the</text>
  <text start="2045.02" dur="7.23">second FISA warrant was submitted and</text>
  <text start="2047.57" dur="7.849">approved and remember it takes one FBI</text>
  <text start="2052.25" dur="6">and it takes one DOJ and in not</text>
  <text start="2055.419" dur="7.691">coincidentally both of them work</text>
  <text start="2058.25" dur="7.89">counterintelligence so go figure that</text>
  <text start="2063.11" dur="6.24">out all right number fourteen that</text>
  <text start="2066.14" dur="5.22">October 2016 timeframe is also exactly</text>
  <text start="2069.35" dur="4.23">when the Obama administration submits</text>
  <text start="2071.36" dur="4.319">new narrow requests to the FISA Court so</text>
  <text start="2073.58" dur="6.39">we just talked about that there is no</text>
  <text start="2075.679" dur="6.091">evidence found but the wiretaps continue</text>
  <text start="2079.97" dur="4.32">ostensibly for national security reasons</text>
  <text start="2081.77" dur="4.71">Obama administration is monitoring and</text>
  <text start="2084.29" dur="4.379">opposing presidential campaign using</text>
  <text start="2086.48" dur="2.71">high-tech surveillance powers of the</text>

  <text start="2089.19" dur="11.52">telogen services let&amp;#39;s see alright</text>
  <text start="2098.49" dur="3.75">jumping down yeah this is way too</text>
  <text start="2100.71" dur="3.84">coincidental there there really aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2102.24" dur="3.66">any coincidences in in the intelligence</text>
  <text start="2104.55" dur="3.63">community everything is planned and</text>
  <text start="2105.9" dur="3.66">orchestrated and what they have to do is</text>
  <text start="2108.18" dur="5.46">they have to keep us from finding out</text>
  <text start="2109.56" dur="7.89">about it common sense tells us that</text>
  <text start="2113.64" dur="5.61">judge Contreras was most likely the</text>
  <text start="2117.45" dur="4.23">judge who signed off on the Pfizer</text>
  <text start="2119.25" dur="3.96">warrant in October that led to the</text>
  <text start="2121.68" dur="4.8">surveillance of Trump&amp;#39;s campaign</text>
  <text start="2123.21" dur="8.52">officials and that is why he recused</text>
  <text start="2126.48" dur="8.369">himself yesterday from Flynn&amp;#39;s case we</text>
  <text start="2131.73" dur="7.23">don&amp;#39;t know it for sure but it seems like</text>
  <text start="2134.849" dur="6.811">a reasonable conclusion to come to it</text>
  <text start="2138.96" dur="5.52">would be explosive if it turned out that</text>
  <text start="2141.66" dur="5.79">the FISA warrant gained by was gained by</text>
  <text start="2144.48" dur="4.92">deception misleading manipulated</text>
  <text start="2147.45" dur="4.8">information or fraud and that the</text>
  <text start="2149.4" dur="5.669">warrant led that led to the wiretapping</text>
  <text start="2152.25" dur="5.19">and surveillance of Flynn was authorized</text>
  <text start="2155.069" dur="3.991">by Contreras who was now in charge of</text>
  <text start="2157.44" dur="3.72">his case okay</text>
  <text start="2159.06" dur="4.68">can you imagine the optics if somebody</text>
  <text start="2161.16" dur="5.13">finds out that the judge who took</text>
  <text start="2163.74" dur="5.01">Flynn&amp;#39;s guilty plea and presided over</text>
  <text start="2166.29" dur="4.74">his case was the same judge who signed</text>
  <text start="2168.75" dur="5.099">the FISA warrant that allowed him to be</text>
  <text start="2171.03" dur="5.819">surveilled how would that look if that</text>
  <text start="2173.849" dur="6.421">came out in the national newspapers that</text>
  <text start="2176.849" dur="5.581">is some bad optics and there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="2180.27" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;re gonna let that happen and I</text>
  <text start="2182.43" dur="4.919">think I think when they realized that</text>
  <text start="2184.77" dur="4.319">Strock was outed when or was outed</text>
  <text start="2187.349" dur="4.081">people are figuring out what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="2189.089" dur="5.101">inside the FBI and the DOJ there&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="2191.43" dur="4.59">this pressure from Nunez and the House</text>
  <text start="2194.19" dur="4.47">Intelligence Committee to find out about</text>
  <text start="2196.02" dur="4.67">the Steele dossier and who is behind it</text>
  <text start="2198.66" dur="7.23">and who paid for it where it came from</text>
  <text start="2200.69" dur="7.09">DOJ and FBI realized we are losing this</text>
  <text start="2205.89" dur="5.31">narrative and everything&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="2207.78" dur="5.46">uncovered they couldn&amp;#39;t risk this judge</text>
  <text start="2211.2" dur="3.84">being found out as the one who was</text>
  <text start="2213.24" dur="3.839">involved in the whole process so</text>
  <text start="2215.04" dur="4.68">somebody got him off the case and they</text>

  <text start="2305.579" dur="3.54">she was trying to get us to believe but</text>
  <text start="2307.14" dur="4.89">if you look at the actual report and</text>
  <text start="2309.119" dur="6.871">Sundance read it and looked at the</text>
  <text start="2312.03" dur="5.88">report okay there are essentially four</text>

  <text start="2344.04" dur="6.15">on it I don&amp;#39;t support it it&amp;#39;s BS so of</text>
  <text start="2346.92" dur="5.58">the four actual intelligence agencies</text>
  <text start="2350.19" dur="3.97">only three of them signed on to it and</text>
  <text start="2352.5" dur="5.02">you can know why they signed on to</text>
  <text start="2354.16" dur="5.7">because they were all in favor of</text>
  <text start="2357.52" dur="3.63">Hillary and Obama and Rogers was the</text>
  <text start="2359.86" dur="4.35">only one who was like these guys are</text>
  <text start="2361.15" dur="4.11">clowns this is a and Sundance goes to</text>
  <text start="2364.21" dur="2.85">the report and says like it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2365.26" dur="5.63">nonsense there&amp;#39;s nothing in there that</text>
  <text start="2367.06" dur="6.03">is that is relevant it&amp;#39;s just a bunch of</text>
  <text start="2370.89" dur="5.77">it has a bunch of smoke and mirrors</text>
  <text start="2373.09" dur="6.96">really so number 22 going on it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2376.66" dur="6.57">important to note that NSA Atma Rodgers</text>
  <text start="2380.05" dur="6.27">would have details on every angle of</text>
  <text start="2383.23" dur="4.86">intelligence also worth noting Rodgers</text>

  <text start="2460.39" dur="4.89">to one of trumps of golf courses</text>
  <text start="2462.39" dur="5.02">probably because they found out that the</text>
  <text start="2465.28" dur="8.94">entire truck tower was bugged and that</text>
  <text start="2467.41" dur="9.3">CIA was listening to that so no surprise</text>
  <text start="2474.22" dur="6.45">why Rogers was retained by Trump as</text>
  <text start="2476.71" dur="6.15">national security a head of NSA because</text>
  <text start="2480.67" dur="4.74">Rogers is a white hat one of the only</text>

  <text start="2488.47" dur="10.619">also at the same time frame clapper and</text>
  <text start="2495.509" dur="7.171">it is screaming for Rogers to be fired</text>
  <text start="2499.089" dur="8.97">by Obama because he knows that Rogers is</text>
  <text start="2502.68" dur="11.26">sympathetic to Trump and we know thanks</text>
  <text start="2508.059" dur="7.5">to judge Knapp we know that one of the</text>
  <text start="2513.94" dur="3.359">things that the Obama administration did</text>
  <text start="2515.559" dur="8.55">was they went to British intelligence</text>
  <text start="2517.299" dur="8.79">GCHQ to get information because probably</text>
  <text start="2524.109" dur="5.43">because Rogers would not comply with</text>
  <text start="2526.089" dur="6.03">their requests and when judge Knapp</text>
  <text start="2529.539" dur="5.55">broke that story he got suspended by Fox</text>
  <text start="2532.119" dur="5.131">but it later turned out to be true that</text>
  <text start="2535.089" dur="3.541">they did go to British intelligence to</text>
  <text start="2537.25" dur="3.509">get information so they could go around</text>
  <text start="2538.63" dur="5.459">the NSA they actually went inside the</text>
  <text start="2540.759" dur="5.461">NSA but British intelligence has a</text>
  <text start="2544.089" dur="6.651">little compartment inside the NSA and</text>
  <text start="2546.22" dur="4.52">that&amp;#39;s where they went to all right so</text>
  <text start="2553.68" dur="4.839">defense secretary Carter ash and clapper</text>
  <text start="2556.779" dur="4.381">are screaming for Rogers to be fired</text>
  <text start="2558.519" dur="6.54">especially after he goes in briefs Trump</text>
  <text start="2561.16" dur="7.29">team what was happening in October of</text>
  <text start="2565.059" dur="5.25">2016 that&amp;#39;s when the sketchy FISA</text>
  <text start="2568.45" dur="4.849">warrant was applied for and granted by</text>
  <text start="2570.309" dur="6.121">the FISA Court do you think perhaps that</text>
  <text start="2573.299" dur="4.99">NSA director Rogers may have had</text>
  <text start="2576.43" dur="6.21">reservations about the application</text>
  <text start="2578.289" dur="6.99">content expressed them within the</text>
  <text start="2582.64" dur="7.86">intelligence community annex oh do you</text>
  <text start="2585.279" dur="9.721">think Rogers may have told the Defense</text>
  <text start="2590.5" dur="6.329">Department and FBI and CIA hey I have</text>
  <text start="2595" dur="3.839">problems with what you guys are doing I</text>
  <text start="2596.829" dur="5.04">don&amp;#39;t think this is right and maybe they</text>
  <text start="2598.839" dur="4.561">went after him because he expressed</text>
  <text start="2601.869" dur="3.841">properties like look this is not cool</text>
  <text start="2603.4" dur="5.07">this is we shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this this</text>
  <text start="2605.71" dur="4.379">is gonna blow up so they go after Rogers</text>
  <text start="2608.47" dur="3.359">because he is not a team player he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2610.089" dur="3.75">on board and he&amp;#39;s not gonna let this go</text>
  <text start="2611.829" dur="6.96">on well he didn&amp;#39;t have an ability to</text>
  <text start="2613.839" dur="5.911">stop it really but it seems likely that</text>
  <text start="2618.789" dur="2.58">they went after</text>
  <text start="2619.75" dur="17.31">because he was not on board with their</text>
  <text start="2621.369" dur="18.451">plan so let&amp;#39;s see going down if yes is</text>
  <text start="2637.06" dur="6.299">it likely that president-elect elect</text>
  <text start="2639.82" dur="6.06">Trump also knew at least in a</text>

  <text start="2645.88" dur="6.719">material that the FBI and DOJ used to</text>
  <text start="2648.73" dur="5.61">get the FISA warrant and the information</text>
  <text start="2652.599" dur="5.221">is sealed off they would that also</text>
  <text start="2654.34" dur="6.509">explain why he was tweeting about why</text>
  <text start="2657.82" dur="6.029">Obama had his wires tapped at Trump</text>
  <text start="2660.849" dur="6.061">Tower see Trump knew all this stuff I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2663.849" dur="6.351">fairly certain the Office of Inspector</text>

  <text start="2956.42" dur="5.67">at this point but I&amp;#39;m one of those</text>
  <text start="2959.06" dur="5.04">people who I see I don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="2962.09" dur="4.17">information to decide whether Muller is</text>
  <text start="2964.1" dur="4.92">a black hat or a white hat some of these</text>
  <text start="2966.26" dur="4.2">guys insist Muller is a white hat some</text>
  <text start="2969.02" dur="4.95">people are saying well there&amp;#39;s a black</text>
  <text start="2970.46" dur="5.76">hat I I don&amp;#39;t know I I don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="2973.97" dur="4.65">take a position on that because I could</text>
  <text start="2976.22" dur="4.67">just sit back and wait and see what</text>
  <text start="2978.62" dur="5.52">happens with the Muller investigation</text>
  <text start="2980.89" dur="5.98">you know some people are gonna be doing</text>
  <text start="2984.14" dur="5.4">the victory dance and saying I was right</text>
  <text start="2986.87" dur="4.53">I was right I told you guys Muller was a</text>
  <text start="2989.54" dur="3.39">black hat and other people are gonna be</text>
  <text start="2991.4" dur="3.54">you know if Muller turns out to be a</text>
  <text start="2992.93" dur="3.54">white hat people are gonna be beating</text>
  <text start="2994.94" dur="3.66">their chests and taking the victory lap</text>
  <text start="2996.47" dur="3.57">saying see I told you Mahler wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2998.6" dur="3.72">white hat you didn&amp;#39;t believe me you guys</text>
  <text start="3000.04" dur="5.49">were all wrong I don&amp;#39;t care about that</text>

  <text start="3005.53" dur="6.75">right in this thing I am sitting back</text>
  <text start="3008.29" dur="4.76">and I&amp;#39;m trying to analyze as objectively</text>
  <text start="3012.28" dur="3.72">as I can</text>
  <text start="3013.05" dur="4.45">what I see going on I&amp;#39;m looking for</text>
  <text start="3016" dur="2.67">people who have good information I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3017.5" dur="1.8">looking for people who are somewhat</text>
  <text start="3018.67" dur="3.15">objective</text>
  <text start="3019.3" dur="4.23">people who have already picked winners</text>
  <text start="3021.82" dur="4.98">and losers who have picked bad guys good</text>
  <text start="3023.53" dur="6.06">guys they don&amp;#39;t objectively evaluate</text>
  <text start="3026.8" dur="5.07">anything everything they look at has to</text>
  <text start="3029.59" dur="4.67">fit within the framework of what they</text>
  <text start="3031.87" dur="5.4">already believe it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="3034.26" dur="5.74">confirmation bias is strong confirmation</text>
  <text start="3037.27" dur="4.35">bias forces you to look for information</text>
  <text start="3040" dur="5.55">that supports which you&amp;#39;ve already</text>
  <text start="3041.62" dur="6.54">believed and I&amp;#39;m looking at information</text>
  <text start="3045.55" dur="7.08">from both sides I&amp;#39;m trying to critically</text>
  <text start="3048.16" dur="8.97">evaluate this stuff and you know come up</text>
  <text start="3052.63" dur="7.17">with logical rational conclusions about</text>
  <text start="3057.13" dur="4.17">it without having to have everybody</text>
  <text start="3059.8" dur="3.48">figured out everyone this person&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3061.3" dur="3.38">black hat that person&amp;#39;s away that you</text>
  <text start="3063.28" dur="4.59">know these people are bad these are good</text>
  <text start="3064.68" dur="5.8">at this point in the game since Chris</text>

  <text start="3078.58" dur="2.81">too early to make those decisions I</text>
  <text start="3080.32" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t think we have enough information</text>
  <text start="3081.39" dur="5.74">you can make it your own call if you</text>
