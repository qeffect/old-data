  <text start="119.9" dur="7.98">about fear and a lot of other things but</text>
  <text start="124.13" dur="5.22">mostly the issue of fear because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="127.88" dur="5.579">something that&amp;#39;s been coming up in my</text>
  <text start="129.35" dur="5.58">prayer requests a lot lately I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="133.459" dur="3.901">receiving a lot of prayer requests over</text>
  <text start="134.93" dur="4.92">the last month and I&amp;#39;m seeing some</text>
  <text start="137.36" dur="5.76">recurring themes in the per request I</text>
  <text start="139.85" dur="6.24">get quite a few emails from people who</text>
  <text start="143.12" dur="6.03">have anxiety attacks who have panic</text>
  <text start="146.09" dur="4.92">attacks who seem to be overcome by fear</text>
  <text start="149.15" dur="3.6">a lot of those people</text>
  <text start="151.01" dur="3.33">also have chronic pain they have things</text>
  <text start="152.75" dur="4.2">like fibromyalgia some of them have</text>
  <text start="154.34" dur="4.679">asthma we talked a couple of weeks ago</text>
  <text start="156.95" dur="4.91">in the podcast with faith living about</text>
  <text start="159.019" dur="6.511">fear and how we believe fear is a spirit</text>
  <text start="161.86" dur="7.3">that tries to influence and attack us</text>
  <text start="165.53" dur="8.31">and one of the best ways to overcome</text>
  <text start="169.16" dur="5.609">fear is to simply resist it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="173.84" dur="3.2">one of the things we&amp;#39;re going to talk</text>
  <text start="174.769" dur="5.94">about in this message is how to resist</text>
  <text start="177.04" dur="5.62">things like fear and anxiety and why we</text>
  <text start="180.709" dur="4.201">need to resist them because if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="182.66" dur="4.2">resist them so I&amp;#39;m not so good things</text>
  <text start="184.91" dur="5.07">happen well it seems like you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="186.86" dur="6.209">wide open for all sorts of fear I mean</text>
  <text start="189.98" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s fear of all kinds of things right</text>
  <text start="193.069" dur="2.371">there are so many things you can fear</text>
  <text start="194.42" dur="2.52">mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="195.44" dur="3.659">fear that you&amp;#39;re not gonna have enough</text>
  <text start="196.94" dur="4.68">money to pay the bills fear that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="199.099" dur="4.441">going to lose your job fear that your</text>
  <text start="201.62" dur="4.26">kids are going to be coming on drugs</text>
  <text start="203.54" dur="4.46">fear of getting into relationships</text>
  <text start="205.88" dur="4.68">because you might it might not work out</text>
  <text start="208" dur="5.47">all sorts of things yeah and that</text>
  <text start="210.56" dur="6.03">actually provides a good segue for our</text>
  <text start="213.47" dur="6.18">Bible verse okay we have a Bible verse</text>
  <text start="216.59" dur="5.64">we have a bunch of Bible verses</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="4.32">this is an unusual podcast because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="222.23" dur="3.87">gonna dig into the scriptures here and</text>
  <text start="223.97" dur="5.34">do a little bit of teaching I wanted to</text>
  <text start="226.1" dur="5.75">go to job chapter 1 and look at the</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="5.19">interaction with job and Satan and God</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="4.509">because one of the things I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="234.5" dur="4.829">running into it particularly in the</text>
  <text start="236.359" dur="5.491">realm of healing when someone isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="239.329" dur="5.28">healed they always want to bring up job</text>
  <text start="241.85" dur="4.65">well what about job yeah oh you hear</text>
  <text start="244.609" dur="3.901">that all the time maybe it&amp;#39;s not God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="246.5" dur="6.079">will to young people you know maybe God</text>
  <text start="248.51" dur="4.069">just needs us to suffer and being sick</text>
  <text start="254.049" dur="6.821">give the back story the back story the</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="4.921">sons of God are coming to and fro in</text>
  <text start="260.87" dur="5.01">heaven and it says Satan was with them</text>
  <text start="262.91" dur="5.009">so Satan and the Lord have a little</text>
  <text start="265.88" dur="3.659">conversation and the Lord said to Satan</text>
  <text start="267.919" dur="3.72">hey have you considered my servant job</text>
  <text start="269.539" dur="5.371">that there is none like him on the earth</text>
  <text start="271.639" dur="5.761">he&amp;#39;s blameless he&amp;#39;s upright he fears me</text>
  <text start="274.91" dur="6.06">and he shuns evil Satan answered and</text>
  <text start="277.4" dur="5.62">said does job fear you for nothing have</text>
  <text start="280.97" dur="4.12">you not made a hedge around him</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="4.71">around his household and around all that</text>
  <text start="285.09" dur="4.32">he has on every side you&amp;#39;ve blessed the</text>
  <text start="287.73" dur="3.48">work of his hands and his possessions</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="3.3">and you&amp;#39;ve increased in lent but now</text>
  <text start="291.21" dur="3.84">stretch out your hand again and touch</text>
  <text start="292.71" dur="6.99">all that he has and he&amp;#39;ll surely curse</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="7.26">you to his face so Satan makes a couple</text>
  <text start="299.7" dur="4.47">of observations one of which is he made</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="4.47">the observation that the hand of God was</text>
  <text start="304.17" dur="7.01">protecting Joe he said you&amp;#39;ve made a</text>
  <text start="306.78" dur="7.65">hedge around him I can&amp;#39;t attack him</text>
  <text start="311.18" dur="5.38">because you&amp;#39;ve made a hedge around him</text>
  <text start="314.43" dur="3.48">and you&amp;#39;ve protected him and as long as</text>
  <text start="316.56" dur="3.9">that hedge of protection is there I</text>
  <text start="317.91" dur="6.39">can&amp;#39;t do anything against it mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="320.46" dur="7.68">so Satan is trying to get God to smite</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="6.78">Jobe because Satan is looking at it as</text>
  <text start="328.14" dur="5.88">if okay God you&amp;#39;ve protected this guy</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="5.43">he&amp;#39;s inside your fortress I want you to</text>
  <text start="334.02" dur="6.69">attack him but see God didn&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="336.51" dur="8.01">going to attack him right God says to</text>
  <text start="340.71" dur="6.99">Satan behold all that he has is in your</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="5.13">power only do not touch his body so you</text>
  <text start="347.7" dur="4.74">can&amp;#39;t make him sick but you can take all</text>
  <text start="349.65" dur="3.27">of this stuff now this is where it gets</text>
  <text start="352.44" dur="2.85">interesting</text>
  <text start="352.92" dur="5.85">so Satan goes out from the presence of</text>
  <text start="355.29" dur="6.18">the Lord and in the next you know 10</text>
  <text start="358.77" dur="5.22">verses Satan goes and just destroys his</text>
  <text start="361.47" dur="5.25">whole life kills his children kills his</text>
  <text start="363.99" dur="5.94">workers Chaldeans come and they destroy</text>
  <text start="366.72" dur="5.91">his his farm and they take his camels</text>
  <text start="369.93" dur="4.77">and his cattle a wind storm comes blows</text>
  <text start="372.63" dur="4.11">down his house kills his family and that</text>
  <text start="374.7" dur="3.63">was a bad time oh and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="376.74" dur="5.01">interesting because I never really</text>
  <text start="378.33" dur="6.12">thought focus on this this is crazy in</text>
  <text start="381.75" dur="4.41">verse 16 it says the fire of God fell</text>
  <text start="384.45" dur="4.56">from heaven and burned up the sheep and</text>
  <text start="386.16" dur="5.22">his servants okay so this is like what</text>
  <text start="389.01" dur="4.23">remember when Elijah</text>
  <text start="391.38" dur="4.98">calling down fire from heaven and</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="4.5">killing the his enemies James and John</text>
  <text start="396.36" dur="2.61">want to do the same thing they wanted to</text>
  <text start="397.74" dur="3.81">call fire down from heaven and Jesus</text>
  <text start="398.97" dur="4.98">told them you do not know what spirit</text>
  <text start="401.55" dur="4.35">you are of you do not want to be calling</text>
  <text start="403.95" dur="3.81">down fire from heaven because it will</text>
  <text start="405.9" dur="5.97">come down but it&amp;#39;s not the father who</text>
  <text start="407.76" dur="9.03">sends it anyway so job&amp;#39;s life falls</text>
  <text start="411.87" dur="7.86">apart then in chapter 2 Satan comes back</text>
  <text start="416.79" dur="5.97">and the Lord says hey Satan have you</text>
  <text start="419.73" dur="7.14">considered my servant job and Satan says</text>
  <text start="422.76" dur="5.52">yes I have and I&amp;#39;ve done everything I</text>
  <text start="426.87" dur="4.38">can to destroy him and he still won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="4.17">curse you but he has another plan he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431.25" dur="3.72">like hey wait a minute you didn&amp;#39;t let me</text>
  <text start="432.45" dur="6.78">make him sick yet let me make it back</text>
  <text start="434.97" dur="6.78">and because surely then yes because a</text>
  <text start="439.23" dur="5.73">man will give anything for his life so</text>
  <text start="441.75" dur="6.69">the Lord again says behold he is in your</text>
  <text start="444.96" dur="6.51">hand yeah that&amp;#39;s something that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="448.44" dur="5.43">think of nobody talks about that God</text>
  <text start="451.47" dur="6.69">doesn&amp;#39;t say okay I&amp;#39;ll make him sick God</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="6.99">says he is in your control now yeah and</text>
  <text start="458.16" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s funny because like God didn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="460.86" dur="7.17">I&amp;#39;m lifting my hedge of protection God</text>
  <text start="463.98" dur="6.87">didn&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m going to allow you to go</text>
  <text start="468.03" dur="5.22">after him God simply says he&amp;#39;s in your</text>
  <text start="470.85" dur="3.9">hand what do you I think what God was</text>
  <text start="473.25" dur="3.48">telling Satan was something that he</text>
  <text start="474.75" dur="5.7">didn&amp;#39;t know I think God was telling</text>
  <text start="476.73" dur="6.93">Satan he is already in your hand you</text>
  <text start="480.45" dur="4.56">have access to him you go find out how</text>
  <text start="483.66" dur="4.17">you have access to him and if you think</text>
  <text start="485.01" dur="5.7">you can make him sick go ahead so Joe</text>
  <text start="487.83" dur="4.56">becomes sick there&amp;#39;s an interesting</text>
  <text start="490.71" dur="4.23">commentary at the end of the next</text>
  <text start="492.39" dur="3.87">chapter which is chapter 3 Jobe was</text>
  <text start="494.94" dur="3.54">wailing and lamenting the day of his</text>
  <text start="496.26" dur="3.9">birth he says you know why I was a born</text>
  <text start="498.48" dur="3.87">why didn&amp;#39;t I die my life is miserable</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="4.32">you know everything&amp;#39;s been taken from me</text>
  <text start="502.35" dur="4.65">and then he says this in verse 25</text>
  <text start="504.48" dur="5.04">chapter 3 for the thing I greatly feared</text>
  <text start="507" dur="5.82">has come upon me that which I dreaded</text>
  <text start="509.52" dur="8.579">has happened to me fear and dread fear</text>
  <text start="512.82" dur="8.82">and dread right so what was going on in</text>
  <text start="518.099" dur="5.911">job&amp;#39;s mind well Joe was a wealthy man he</text>
  <text start="521.64" dur="3.54">had had it all he had a huge family he</text>
  <text start="524.01" dur="3.78">had everything he was like Donald Trump</text>
  <text start="525.18" dur="4.22">I mean he had it all he was one of the</text>
  <text start="527.79" dur="4.08">wealthiest men on the earth at the time</text>
  <text start="529.4" dur="5.26">what do people with a lot of positions</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="3.72">and wealth often do they fear losing it</text>
  <text start="534.66" dur="3.36">mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="535.59" dur="5.94">and Jobe feared losing all of his stuff</text>
  <text start="538.02" dur="5.1">in his family and that that&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="541.53" dur="5.07">that allowed the enemy to go after him</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="5.46">was the fear because as Steve Harmon</text>
  <text start="546.6" dur="4.56">pointed out in the podcast the other day</text>
  <text start="548.58" dur="6.87">when we are walking with God and we get</text>
  <text start="551.16" dur="6.45">to know him we have to apprehend certain</text>
  <text start="555.45" dur="3.93">principles about our walk with God and</text>
  <text start="557.61" dur="3.81">the first thing you have to understand</text>
  <text start="559.38" dur="4.8">about walking with God is your walk is a</text>
  <text start="561.42" dur="4.89">walk of faith fear is the opposite of</text>
  <text start="564.18" dur="5.97">faith and fears the opposite of faith</text>
  <text start="566.31" dur="6.99">and the kingdom of God is a kingdom that</text>
  <text start="570.15" dur="6.18">operates by faith when you want someone</text>
  <text start="573.3" dur="5.64">to be healed it requires faith when you</text>
  <text start="576.33" dur="4.23">prophesy over somebody you prophesy by</text>
  <text start="578.94" dur="4.32">faith mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="580.56" dur="5.33">when you step out of the boat onto the</text>
  <text start="583.26" dur="5.85">waves you do it by faith right</text>
  <text start="585.89" dur="5.68">everything we do is one by faith the</text>
  <text start="589.11" dur="7.56">just shall live by faith but see here</text>
  <text start="591.57" dur="7.26">job was fearful and he was dreading the</text>
  <text start="596.67" dur="5.18">one thing and that was I&amp;#39;m gonna lose</text>
  <text start="598.83" dur="6.03">all the stuff maybe God can&amp;#39;t protect me</text>
  <text start="601.85" dur="4.75">maybe God is gonna allow something to</text>
  <text start="604.86" dur="4.59">happen maybe I&amp;#39;m gonna lose all this</text>
  <text start="606.6" dur="4.83">stuff and he says what that which I</text>
  <text start="609.45" dur="5.28">feared most has come upon me so it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="611.43" dur="6.81">self-fulfilling well it is it&amp;#39;s a like a</text>
  <text start="614.73" dur="8.94">self-fulfilling prophecy because we know</text>
  <text start="618.24" dur="8.25">that the state of your mind and the way</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="5.97">you view your life in the way you view</text>
  <text start="626.49" dur="5.49">the world and the way you view others as</text>
  <text start="629.64" dur="7.38">Jesus said as a man thinks in his heart</text>
  <text start="631.98" dur="7.08">yeah so he is as we think of ourselves</text>
  <text start="637.02" dur="4.02">and the things we meditate on the things</text>
  <text start="639.06" dur="4.47">that we think of and the things that we</text>
  <text start="641.04" dur="3.96">expect the things we anticipate tend to</text>
  <text start="643.53" dur="5.04">become a reality that we live with and</text>
  <text start="645" dur="7.89">if you are prone to fear and anxiety and</text>
  <text start="648.57" dur="7.76">worry and dread you are giving the enemy</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="6.89">a place to bring that stuff to pass</text>
  <text start="656.33" dur="6.55">because you&amp;#39;re living from place of fear</text>
  <text start="659.78" dur="5.11">at all hours you&amp;#39;re giving the enemy a</text>
  <text start="662.88" dur="5.7">foothold that&amp;#39;s which is what it says in</text>
  <text start="664.89" dur="4.92">Ephesians four verses 26 and 27 Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="668.58" dur="2.61">talking about a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="669.81" dur="3.69">that we shouldn&amp;#39;t shouldn&amp;#39;t do one of</text>
  <text start="671.19" dur="4.14">them is he says do not let the Sun go</text>
  <text start="673.5" dur="4.65">down on your anger do not give the devil</text>
  <text start="675.33" dur="6.97">a foothold or an opportunity in the NASB</text>
  <text start="678.15" dur="6.58">and the word there is actually means do</text>
  <text start="682.3" dur="5.7">give the enemy an opportunity or power</text>
  <text start="684.73" dur="8.18">or an occasion to act upon you hmm</text>
  <text start="688" dur="9.42">see what we do when we let spirits of</text>
  <text start="692.91" dur="7.51">anger and fear and suicide and all these</text>
  <text start="697.42" dur="6.84">other spirits when we allow them to</text>
  <text start="700.42" dur="8.66">influence us and we don&amp;#39;t resist them</text>
  <text start="704.26" dur="9.42">and we don&amp;#39;t resist them we give them an</text>
  <text start="709.08" dur="9.21">opportunity and occasion to act in our</text>
  <text start="713.68" dur="6.57">life and to bring disaster yeah for sure</text>
  <text start="718.29" dur="6.04">what you and I were talking last night</text>
  <text start="720.25" dur="7.68">about how the enemy comes and gets into</text>
  <text start="724.33" dur="8.16">our life and I see our life as something</text>
  <text start="727.93" dur="6.72">like a house actually that&amp;#39;s the analogy</text>
  <text start="732.49" dur="4.95">Jesus used which I&amp;#39;ll explain in just a</text>
  <text start="734.65" dur="4.68">little bit but I believe that God has</text>
  <text start="737.44" dur="5.75">given us dominion and he&amp;#39;s given us</text>
  <text start="739.33" dur="5.94">authority and he&amp;#39;s given us power and</text>
  <text start="743.19" dur="4.87">unfortunately for a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="745.27" dur="3.66">really sincerely believe that God is in</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="3.39">control of everything</text>
  <text start="748.93" dur="5.46">I do not believe God is in control of</text>
  <text start="751.45" dur="6.54">everything you know it&amp;#39;s very clear in</text>
  <text start="754.39" dur="5.7">the Gospels Jesus said all Authority has</text>
  <text start="757.99" dur="5.61">been given to me under heaven and earth</text>
  <text start="760.09" dur="6.09">and then he said to his disciples I gave</text>
  <text start="763.6" dur="6.65">you authority over all the power of the</text>
  <text start="766.18" dur="6.42">enemy so Jesus was given authority over</text>
  <text start="770.25" dur="5.98">the Dominion of the earth and then he</text>
  <text start="772.6" dur="7.29">passed on to us he has delegated</text>
  <text start="776.23" dur="8.13">authority to us which means we are</text>
  <text start="779.89" dur="6.75">responsible for protecting our lives for</text>
  <text start="784.36" dur="4.86">protecting our sphere of influence for</text>
  <text start="786.64" dur="3.9">protecting people in our family for</text>
  <text start="789.22" dur="3.39">protecting our friends we are</text>
  <text start="790.54" dur="4.23">responsible you know I got this prayer</text>
  <text start="792.61" dur="4.95">request from a gal the other day and she</text>
  <text start="794.77" dur="5.25">asked me to pray for a relative to be</text>
  <text start="797.56" dur="4.86">healed and I said and this relative was</text>
  <text start="800.02" dur="5.46">terminal was about to die in a few days</text>
  <text start="802.42" dur="6.09">and I sent back a message saying that</text>
  <text start="805.48" dur="5.37">I&amp;#39;m praying and I got a reply saying</text>
  <text start="808.51" dur="5.34">well I guess God decided that it&amp;#39;s time</text>
  <text start="810.85" dur="4.799">for her to die and so the relative died</text>
  <text start="813.85" dur="6.57">see</text>
  <text start="815.649" dur="6.781">that response to me reveals a person who</text>
  <text start="820.42" dur="3.419">thinks that God is so up there in heaven</text>
  <text start="822.43" dur="5.42">deciding who lives and who dies</text>
  <text start="823.839" dur="6.961">yeah it&amp;#39;s and he isn&amp;#39;t he is not</text>
  <text start="827.85" dur="5.56">deciding who lives and who dies on a</text>
  <text start="830.8" dur="4.979">daily basis we are deciding who lives</text>
  <text start="833.41" dur="4.95">and who dies yeah and more people turn</text>
  <text start="835.779" dur="4.53">away from God for that very reason well</text>
  <text start="838.36" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re almost anything else your mom is</text>
  <text start="840.309" dur="3.481">you know she had that issue because her</text>
  <text start="842.05" dur="3.99">sister died and she felt like God</text>
  <text start="843.79" dur="5.25">decided you know he spun the little</text>
  <text start="846.04" dur="5.219">wheel and let her die torturous death</text>
  <text start="849.04" dur="4.079">time for a six-year-old girl to die slow</text>

  <text start="862.029" dur="4.62">believer and started going they teach</text>
  <text start="864.819" dur="4.56">you that well God must have wanted her</text>
  <text start="866.649" dur="5.49">or God was protecting her from something</text>
  <text start="869.379" dur="4.71">that was gonna happen in her future by</text>
  <text start="872.139" dur="3.12">taking her out well why did she have to</text>
  <text start="874.089" dur="2.91">die a painful death</text>
  <text start="875.259" dur="5.45">why did she have to die a suffering</text>

  <text start="894.37" dur="4.769">in the first two chapters you can see</text>
  <text start="896.29" dur="7.62">who&amp;#39;s responsible for sickness and death</text>
  <text start="899.139" dur="7.11">it&amp;#39;s not God it&amp;#39;s Satan now in the Old</text>
  <text start="903.91" dur="5.969">Testament they didn&amp;#39;t have an</text>
  <text start="906.249" dur="5.58">understanding of demons and Satan Moses</text>
  <text start="909.879" dur="3.63">never wrote about Satan Moses didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="911.829" dur="3.901">write about demons and the powers and</text>
  <text start="913.509" dur="4.44">principalities none of that stuff was</text>
  <text start="915.73" dur="5.279">really on the radar for the Old</text>

  <text start="921.009" dur="3.211">Testament and so to them it looked like</text>
  <text start="922.6" dur="2.94">God was doing all this stuff but then</text>
  <text start="924.22" dur="3.599">one look like the hand of God killing</text>
  <text start="925.54" dur="3.959">people and destroying things and they</text>
  <text start="927.819" dur="4.23">thought you know that here&amp;#39;s the power</text>
  <text start="929.499" dur="4.5">right that&amp;#39;s where all power every</text>
  <text start="932.049" dur="4.2">everything is coming from God and there</text>
  <text start="933.999" dur="5.101">is no opposition to what God is doing</text>
  <text start="936.249" dur="5.221">it&amp;#39;s all God they believe God was</text>
  <text start="939.1" dur="5.699">responsible for all of it in the because</text>
  <text start="941.47" dur="5.309">of the New Testament we see the kingdom</text>
  <text start="944.799" dur="3.301">of darkness we see the principalities</text>
  <text start="946.779" dur="3.601">and powers</text>
  <text start="948.1" dur="5.34">Tod&amp;#39;s because Jesus and Paul and Peter</text>
  <text start="950.38" dur="4.56">and James the New Testament writers</text>
  <text start="953.44" dur="2.94">revealed the kingdom of darkness that</text>
  <text start="954.94" dur="4.259">the Old Testament prophets didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="956.38" dur="6.569">about so we have access to Revelation</text>
  <text start="959.199" dur="5.851">they didn&amp;#39;t have and I think it&amp;#39;s wise</text>
  <text start="962.949" dur="4.861">to look at the Old Testament through the</text>
  <text start="965.05" dur="5.49">lens of the New Testament and look at</text>
  <text start="967.81" dur="4.589">things and go okay well and Jesus said</text>
  <text start="970.54" dur="5.58">if you&amp;#39;ve seen me you&amp;#39;ve seen the father</text>
  <text start="972.399" dur="6.541">so he&amp;#39;s an example right who&amp;#39;s there is</text>
  <text start="976.12" dur="5.82">we have a little more understanding of</text>
  <text start="978.94" dur="5.73">the nature of God today compared to what</text>
  <text start="981.94" dur="4.019">they knew 3,000 years ago still in the</text>
  <text start="984.67" dur="2.76">church there are a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="985.959" dur="2.82">still believe everything that happens is</text>
  <text start="987.43" dur="3.959">God it&amp;#39;s all God&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="988.779" dur="4.531">yeah like he&amp;#39;ll heal one person but he</text>
  <text start="991.389" dur="5.94">won&amp;#39;t heal someone else and the</text>
  <text start="993.31" dur="7.259">suffering is meant to cause them to grow</text>
  <text start="997.329" dur="6.891">or suffering something like that I I</text>
  <text start="1000.569" dur="8.281">don&amp;#39;t disagree with the idea that some</text>
  <text start="1004.22" dur="8.71">forms of pain and suffering can teach us</text>
  <text start="1008.85" dur="6.51">lessons they can yeah Ken but I do not</text>
  <text start="1012.93" dur="4.589">agree with the idea that that sickness</text>
  <text start="1015.36" dur="5.82">is given to us to teach us things</text>
  <text start="1017.519" dur="5.791">because in in the gospels jesus healed</text>
  <text start="1021.18" dur="4.08">everybody who asked for it he healed</text>
  <text start="1023.31" dur="5.34">entire villages He healed entire</text>
  <text start="1025.26" dur="5.189">households anyone who needed healing was</text>
  <text start="1028.65" dur="3.75">healed Jesus didn&amp;#39;t come to people and</text>
  <text start="1030.449" dur="3.811">say well you need to remain sick because</text>
  <text start="1032.4" dur="5.22">you&amp;#39;re learning a lesson sorry difficult</text>
  <text start="1034.26" dur="6.179">circumstances can teach us lessons but I</text>
  <text start="1037.62" dur="5.25">believe healing is not given to us to</text>
  <text start="1040.439" dur="4.98">teach us a lesson so if we&amp;#39;ve been given</text>
  <text start="1042.87" dur="6">Dominion and we&amp;#39;ve been given Authority</text>
  <text start="1045.419" dur="5.941">that means we have responsibility and as</text>
  <text start="1048.87" dur="3.809">I was saying earlier I believe I see our</text>
  <text start="1051.36" dur="4.049">situation as something like having</text>
  <text start="1052.679" dur="7.351">owning a house we have a responsibility</text>
  <text start="1055.409" dur="7.621">to keep our house secure if we do not</text>
  <text start="1060.03" dur="5.19">keep our home secure burglars can break</text>
  <text start="1063.03" dur="4.32">in they can steal our stuff it&amp;#39;s our</text>
  <text start="1065.22" dur="4.14">responsibility to lock the windows lock</text>
  <text start="1067.35" dur="4.14">the doors especially when we leave it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1069.36" dur="5.52">our responsibility to lock up our car if</text>
  <text start="1071.49" dur="7.11">we keep our house secure it prevents or</text>
  <text start="1074.88" dur="5.55">at least deters burglars from breaking</text>
  <text start="1078.6" dur="4.26">in and stealing stuff mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1080.43" dur="5.16">if you leave your doors and windows open</text>
  <text start="1082.86" dur="6.66">if you leave your car door unlocked you</text>
  <text start="1085.59" dur="7.71">are allowing an opportunity for a thief</text>
  <text start="1089.52" dur="6.21">to come and break in and I wouldn&amp;#39;t say</text>
  <text start="1093.3" dur="5.76">that we give the thief legal rights I</text>
  <text start="1095.73" dur="7.14">would say if we don&amp;#39;t do the best that</text>
  <text start="1099.06" dur="6.57">we can to keep our life our body our</text>
  <text start="1102.87" dur="6.6">spirit and soul under the protection of</text>
  <text start="1105.63" dur="5.4">God we give the enemy an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="1109.47" dur="5.97">come and attack us and I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1111.03" dur="6.51">what Jobe did see job was hedged in he</text>
  <text start="1115.44" dur="3.63">had a hedge of protection around him but</text>
  <text start="1117.54" dur="4.83">he walked out from the hedge of</text>
  <text start="1119.07" dur="6.24">protection when he walked in fear when</text>
  <text start="1122.37" dur="5.52">he lived in fear and anxiety over losing</text>
  <text start="1125.31" dur="3.87">his stuff he was coming out from under</text>
  <text start="1127.89" dur="2.79">the hedge of protection and he was</text>
  <text start="1129.18" dur="4.56">walking around in the enemy&amp;#39;s territory</text>
  <text start="1130.68" dur="5.91">I which is why I think God said he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="1133.74" dur="6.42">your hand because he is living in he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1136.59" dur="5.37">already yeah he under knows he&amp;#39;s pretty</text>
  <text start="1140.16" dur="5.67">I&amp;#39;m sure joke knew he was supposed to</text>
  <text start="1141.96" dur="6.36">walk by faith but over that one issue he</text>
  <text start="1145.83" dur="4.32">had fear and dread and anxiety and that</text>
  <text start="1148.32" dur="3.72">was a thing I think that allowed the</text>
  <text start="1150.15" dur="3.81">enemy to attack him and I think we have</text>
  <text start="1152.04" dur="6.45">the same thing how many times in the</text>
  <text start="1153.96" dur="7.35">Bible does the Lord say do not fear do</text>
  <text start="1158.49" dur="5.64">not be anxious for anything be of good</text>
  <text start="1161.31" dur="6.36">courage be brave and very curious it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1164.13" dur="6.21">really repeated over and over and over</text>
  <text start="1167.67" dur="5.13">in the Bible we are told do not be</text>
  <text start="1170.34" dur="3.15">afraid every time an angel shows up and</text>
  <text start="1172.8" dur="3">talks to somebody</text>
  <text start="1173.49" dur="5.4">in the Bible what&amp;#39;s the first thing the</text>
  <text start="1175.8" dur="5.43">angel says do not be a fear yeah right</text>
  <text start="1178.89" dur="4.44">because why because we&amp;#39;re fearful people</text>
  <text start="1181.23" dur="6.12">whenever we see something that&amp;#39;s scared</text>
  <text start="1183.33" dur="7.2">God what is that yeah so so would you</text>
  <text start="1187.35" dur="7.35">say that as much as sin gives the enemy</text>
  <text start="1190.53" dur="6.63">a foothold feasting being fearful and</text>
  <text start="1194.7" dur="6.15">being unbelieving is not a good thing</text>
  <text start="1197.16" dur="7.29">the reason why God tells us over and</text>
  <text start="1200.85" dur="5.88">over again not to be fearful and not to</text>
  <text start="1204.45" dur="3.57">be anxious and not to be worried it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1206.73" dur="3.27">not just because he wants to be a</text>
  <text start="1208.02" dur="3.96">taskmaster and he wants us to somehow</text>
  <text start="1210" dur="3.809">muster up all kinds of strength and</text>
  <text start="1211.98" dur="5.759">faith it&amp;#39;s because</text>
  <text start="1213.809" dur="6.631">if we are walking in fear and doubt we</text>
  <text start="1217.739" dur="5.31">are giving the enemy plenty of</text>
  <text start="1220.44" dur="5.189">opportunity to come and attack us mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="1223.049" dur="5.791">and that includes diseases I think</text>
  <text start="1225.629" dur="6.6">things like asthma fibromyalgia I</text>
  <text start="1228.84" dur="6.449">suspect probably autoimmune diseases a</text>
  <text start="1232.229" dur="5.07">lot of that are tied into fear and</text>
  <text start="1235.289" dur="3.33">anxiety because when I get these prayer</text>
  <text start="1237.299" dur="3.771">requests from people I see the same</text>
  <text start="1238.619" dur="7.35">things over and over again chronic pain</text>
  <text start="1241.07" dur="6.909">fear anxiety even well when we were</text>

  <text start="1367.01" dur="6">programming at our mind yes now we know</text>
  <text start="1370.22" dur="5.79">that people who have suffered emotional</text>
  <text start="1373.01" dur="5.28">trauma react because of the way that</text>
  <text start="1376.01" dur="3.51">they&amp;#39;re programmed we all rectal probe</text>
  <text start="1378.29" dur="2.64">Ram I get up in the morning and I make</text>

  <text start="1388.91" dur="4.05">think about it</text>
  <text start="1389.78" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s just programmed into me well a lot</text>
  <text start="1392.96" dur="5.97">of people have been programmed to react</text>
  <text start="1395.78" dur="4.92">to situations like with their finances</text>
  <text start="1398.93" dur="3.51">or with when they get into an argument</text>
  <text start="1400.7" dur="6.6">with a husband or wife they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1402.44" dur="8.43">programmed to react out of anger or fear</text>
  <text start="1407.3" dur="6.99">and we have to somehow find a way to</text>
  <text start="1410.87" dur="5.19">break that that program break this cycle</text>
  <text start="1414.29" dur="5.07">and start responding and reacting</text>
  <text start="1416.06" dur="7.68">differently instead of reacting out of</text>
  <text start="1419.36" dur="6.48">anger fear or rejection which is what a</text>

  <text start="1435.17" dur="3.75">feel like we&amp;#39;re making a choice it feels</text>
  <text start="1437.15" dur="4.41">like an automatic reaction but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1438.92" dur="6.17">actually making a choice to react in</text>
  <text start="1441.56" dur="9.03">fear or anger or whatever and I think</text>
  <text start="1445.09" dur="9.46">the key to being healed of those issues</text>
  <text start="1450.59" dur="6.51">is to slow down for a second think about</text>
  <text start="1454.55" dur="5.97">the situation and think about what God</text>
  <text start="1457.1" dur="6.77">has said about us or that situation and</text>
  <text start="1460.52" dur="5.55">if he has told us look I want you to</text>
  <text start="1463.87" dur="5.92">respond to this person in love and</text>

  <text start="1475.16" dur="5.13">to react in love well here&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1478.61" dur="4.83">thing I just want to bring up</text>
  <text start="1480.29" dur="6.15">how many times have we heard people who</text>
  <text start="1483.44" dur="6.99">got a doctor&amp;#39;s diagnosis of something</text>
  <text start="1486.44" dur="7.32">like MS and and they actually turned it</text>
  <text start="1490.43" dur="5.55">around they put up Bible verses all over</text>
  <text start="1493.76" dur="4.83">their house of all the healing</text>
  <text start="1495.98" dur="4.53">scriptures they decided they are gonna</text>
  <text start="1498.59" dur="5.13">change their mind they are not going to</text>
  <text start="1500.51" dur="6.39">agree with that diagnosis necessarily I</text>
  <text start="1503.72" dur="6.03">mean yeah they might go along with their</text>
  <text start="1506.9" dur="5.13">doctors advice for a while but meanwhile</text>
  <text start="1509.75" dur="3.87">they are filling themselves with the</text>
  <text start="1512.03" dur="4.62">opposite they&amp;#39;re filling themselves with</text>
  <text start="1513.62" dur="5.88">faith right they are doing exercise and</text>
  <text start="1516.65" dur="4.47">coming to the fear I receive they get</text>
  <text start="1519.5" dur="4.41">healed doing that I know they do</text>
  <text start="1521.12" dur="6.96">I know weed that Wendy Moore got healed</text>
  <text start="1523.91" dur="6.72">of Lou Gehrig&amp;#39;s disease yes and I think</text>
  <text start="1528.08" dur="6.39">I suspect the reason why she got healed</text>
  <text start="1530.63" dur="6.09">was because she absolutely adamantly</text>
  <text start="1534.47" dur="4.44">refused to accept that as her identity</text>
  <text start="1536.72" dur="3.93">she took the sticky notes she wrote</text>
  <text start="1538.91" dur="3">healing Bible verses put them up all</text>
  <text start="1540.65" dur="3.96">over the inside of her house and she</text>
  <text start="1541.91" dur="5.22">just built a fortress literally built a</text>
  <text start="1544.61" dur="5.01">fortress of the Word of God around her</text>
  <text start="1547.13" dur="4.26">life and decided I am gonna beat this</text>
  <text start="1549.62" dur="3.99">thing I am NOT going to accept it and</text>
  <text start="1551.39" dur="4.53">yeah then within three years I mean for</text>
  <text start="1553.61" dur="4.71">a year and a half the symptoms</text>
  <text start="1555.92" dur="4.08">progressed and she got worse and weaker</text>
  <text start="1558.32" dur="3.81">and then it reversed and she eventually</text>
  <text start="1560" dur="4.86">got healed I think every time you feel</text>
  <text start="1562.13" dur="5.7">that fear come up and you wreak if you</text>
  <text start="1564.86" dur="6.63">can recognize okay this is fear coming</text>
  <text start="1567.83" dur="8.34">on me that you you could counteract that</text>
  <text start="1571.49" dur="6.84">with the Bible or with you can surround</text>
  <text start="1576.17" dur="4.77">yourself with healing testimonies reign</text>
  <text start="1578.33" dur="5.79">we&amp;#39;ve done that in our lives absolutely</text>
  <text start="1580.94" dur="5.31">if you saturate yourself with the fact</text>
  <text start="1584.12" dur="5.67">that you know God is healing people out</text>
  <text start="1586.25" dur="6.09">there you know were like not watched a</text>
  <text start="1589.79" dur="4.29">lot of healing on video and healing</text>
  <text start="1592.34" dur="3.57">testimonies probably would still be</text>
  <text start="1594.08" dur="3.84">struggling to see people healed there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1595.91" dur="4.41">and there&amp;#39;s so much great stuff online</text>
  <text start="1597.92" dur="4.77">now that you you have access to that we</text>
  <text start="1600.32" dur="3.96">didn&amp;#39;t have access to years ago and you</text>
  <text start="1602.69" dur="4.47">know when people get the diagnosis</text>
  <text start="1604.28" dur="6.33">regardless of what it is your initial</text>
  <text start="1607.16" dur="6.37">reaction I think tends to set you off in</text>
  <text start="1610.61" dur="5.26">a trajectory that&amp;#39;s either going to</text>
  <text start="1613.53" dur="4.83">you up in negative territory or positive</text>
  <text start="1615.87" dur="5.58">territory like I got this email from a</text>
  <text start="1618.36" dur="5.31">woman a couple weeks ago and she said I</text>
  <text start="1621.45" dur="4.38">just received a diagnosis of I forget</text>
  <text start="1623.67" dur="3.72">what it was and she said I&amp;#39;m standing in</text>
  <text start="1625.83" dur="3.63">faith and believing God&amp;#39;s gonna heal me</text>
  <text start="1627.39" dur="4.05">okay that was those are her first two</text>
  <text start="1629.46" dur="3.93">sentences I&amp;#39;m standing in faith and I</text>
  <text start="1631.44" dur="3.69">believe in God&amp;#39;s gonna heal me and the</text>
  <text start="1633.39" dur="3.93">next four or five sentences were</text>
  <text start="1635.13" dur="5.76">something too defective I just can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1637.32" dur="5.97">imagine going down this road of being</text>
  <text start="1640.89" dur="3.78">disabled I&amp;#39;m thinking about what it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1643.29" dur="2.88">gonna be like in a nursing home I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1644.67" dur="3.42">thinking about what its gonna be like to</text>
  <text start="1646.17" dur="3.36">lose my property I&amp;#39;m thinking about what</text>
  <text start="1648.09" dur="3.18">my family&amp;#39;s gonna have to go through</text>
  <text start="1649.53" dur="3.6">when I lose my money yeah take care of</text>
  <text start="1651.27" dur="5.46">me I can&amp;#39;t imagine the horror I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="1653.13" dur="6.14">suffer her first two sentences she was</text>
  <text start="1656.73" dur="5.31">she was saying what she was programmed</text>
  <text start="1659.27" dur="4.15">to say everyone has to say oh I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1662.04" dur="3.72">standing in faith and I&amp;#39;m just believing</text>
  <text start="1663.42" dur="3.93">for this yeah and then she starts going</text>
  <text start="1665.76" dur="2.88">on and on and on about all the bad</text>
  <text start="1667.35" dur="4.29">things that she&amp;#39;s envisioning her gonna</text>
  <text start="1668.64" dur="6.15">happen to her yeah now there you know</text>
  <text start="1671.64" dur="5.24">that is being a double-minded there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1674.79" dur="5.58">other way to say it it&amp;#39;s having a mind</text>
  <text start="1676.88" dur="6.94">where you know you&amp;#39;re responsible to</text>
  <text start="1680.37" dur="7.05">respond in faith and be courageous and</text>
  <text start="1683.82" dur="7.26">at the same time you are allowing the</text>
  <text start="1687.42" dur="6.15">enemy to bombard your mind with negative</text>
  <text start="1691.08" dur="4.92">thoughts and fears and anxieties and</text>
  <text start="1693.57" dur="4.71">worries about the future and you are</text>
  <text start="1696" dur="5.01">walking into the enemy&amp;#39;s trap when you</text>
  <text start="1698.28" dur="4.47">do that yeah and it&amp;#39;s so normal I think</text>
  <text start="1701.01" dur="4.05">for people to do that it&amp;#39;s like your</text>
  <text start="1702.75" dur="5.82">natural reaction but that&amp;#39;s why I think</text>
  <text start="1705.06" dur="5.79">you need to be so deliberate to</text>
  <text start="1708.57" dur="5.73">counteract it like you really have to be</text>
  <text start="1710.85" dur="5.4">aware it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost human nature to</text>
  <text start="1714.3" dur="4.8">think about the negative and dwell on</text>
  <text start="1716.25" dur="5.28">the negative aspects but it is</text>
  <text start="1719.1" dur="4.37">absolutely destructive you have to you</text>
  <text start="1721.53" dur="6.39">have to be very intentional about</text>
  <text start="1723.47" dur="7.15">thinking the right things thinking the</text>
  <text start="1727.92" dur="4.86">positive things believing and</text>
  <text start="1730.62" dur="3.45">anticipating and expecting that God is</text>
  <text start="1732.78" dur="2.55">going to give you the breakthrough and</text>
  <text start="1734.07" dur="2.7">he&amp;#39;s gonna give you the miracle and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1735.33" dur="3.9">gonna meet your needs and he&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="1736.77" dur="4.08">provide it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not an easy thing to</text>
  <text start="1739.23" dur="3.93">do it&amp;#39;s but if you have negative</text>
  <text start="1740.85" dur="4.26">internal self your self-talk your</text>
  <text start="1743.16" dur="3.13">dialogue in your head is negative a lot</text>

  <text start="1757.81" dur="3.87">gonna be that does not help you have to</text>
  <text start="1760.03" dur="4.62">surround yourself with positive people I</text>
  <text start="1761.68" dur="5.97">think yeah people of faith people who</text>
  <text start="1764.65" dur="4.83">can help you reverse direction and get</text>
  <text start="1767.65" dur="3.15">out of the trap that the enemy wants you</text>
  <text start="1769.48" dur="4.47">to walk into because that&amp;#39;s really what</text>
  <text start="1770.8" dur="7.14">it is so I wanted to shift gears a</text>
  <text start="1773.95" dur="6.89">little bit and talk about when we get a</text>
  <text start="1777.94" dur="6.54">visitation by the spirit of fear or a</text>

  <text start="2493.36" dur="5.07">ongoing basis we have a lot of irons in</text>
  <text start="2496.15" dur="5.46">the fire I guess but it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="2498.43" dur="6.96">sometimes that requires really working</text>
  <text start="2501.61" dur="6.72">with the person weekly it does the kind</text>
  <text start="2505.39" dur="7.01">of healing that you can&amp;#39;t be done in</text>
  <text start="2508.33" dur="7.11">five minutes it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily take</text>
  <text start="2512.4" dur="5.05">three years of counseling and all that</text>
  <text start="2515.44" dur="6.48">it doesn&amp;#39;t take years of counseling it</text>

  <text start="2526.62" dur="6.22">when Jesus sent out his disciples this</text>
  <text start="2530.35" dur="4.89">is a key thing about the ministry of</text>
  <text start="2532.84" dur="5.13">healing that a lot of people do not want</text>
  <text start="2535.24" dur="5.37">to get real about and it&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="2537.97" dur="4.5">that Steve has figured out over the last</text>
  <text start="2540.61" dur="3.17">couple of years which is why he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2542.47" dur="4.04">do Street healing anymore</text>
  <text start="2543.78" dur="5.82">when Jesus sent out the disciples he</text>
  <text start="2546.51" dur="5.94">sent them out into the villages and he</text>
  <text start="2549.6" dur="8.73">told them to live in the homes of the</text>

  <text start="2558.33" dur="4.71">them about the kingdom teach them about</text>
  <text start="2561.57" dur="3.24">the realities of God</text>
  <text start="2563.04" dur="4.47">you know demons and teach them about</text>
  <text start="2564.81" dur="4.44">sickness and their responsibilities and</text>
  <text start="2567.51" dur="3.6">teach them about their authority and</text>
  <text start="2569.25" dur="4.02">their identity that is something we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2571.11" dur="6.42">not doing that is the main thing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2573.27" dur="8.13">not doing the reason why people stayed</text>
  <text start="2577.53" dur="6.78">healed in the first century what the</text>
  <text start="2581.4" dur="5.91">disciples went out and and healed them</text>
  <text start="2584.31" dur="6.33">is because the disciples of Jesus were</text>
  <text start="2587.31" dur="6.27">making disciples of the people they were</text>
  <text start="2590.64" dur="5.58">getting healed see when I get a prayer</text>
  <text start="2593.58" dur="5.4">request from somebody I can&amp;#39;t disciple</text>
  <text start="2596.22" dur="5.64">them I can&amp;#39;t spend three or four days</text>
  <text start="2598.98" dur="5.64">with them teaching them about their</text>
  <text start="2601.86" dur="6.06">identity and their responsibilities and</text>
  <text start="2604.62" dur="6.27">God&amp;#39;s nature and healing and demons I</text>
  <text start="2607.92" dur="5.16">can&amp;#39;t do that I have 50 more emails I</text>
  <text start="2610.89" dur="4.41">have to get to and I can&amp;#39;t disciple them</text>
  <text start="2613.08" dur="4.38">so I can pray for them and they might</text>
  <text start="2615.3" dur="6.51">get healed but it might come back</text>
  <text start="2617.46" dur="6.09">because if you are not being discipled</text>
  <text start="2621.81" dur="3.99">if you&amp;#39;re not being trained and equipped</text>
  <text start="2623.55" dur="4.35">if you&amp;#39;re not being taught your identity</text>

  <text start="2627.9" dur="7.71">at kingdom you&amp;#39;re not being discipled it</text>
  <text start="2631.5" dur="6.96">is very very difficult for those people</text>
  <text start="2635.61" dur="5.91">to make any progress with their healing</text>
  <text start="2638.46" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s going to come back especially if</text>
  <text start="2641.52" dur="2.94">they have emotional trauma they have</text>

  <text start="2648.81" dur="4.05">convince it&amp;#39;ll be temporary yeah and one</text>
  <text start="2651.21" dur="4.32">of the things I guess if we just make</text>
  <text start="2652.86" dur="5.43">people aware and you know some people</text>
  <text start="2655.53" dur="5.52">are not aware at all of this but other</text>
  <text start="2658.29" dur="6.03">people are so I&amp;#39;m not not speaking to</text>
  <text start="2661.05" dur="5.91">everyone but once you become aware then</text>
  <text start="2664.32" dur="6.6">if you don&amp;#39;t have someone around you who</text>
  <text start="2666.96" dur="5.73">can disciple you in this way then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2670.92" dur="5.24">kind of up to you to look for that</text>
  <text start="2672.69" dur="7.25">information yourself find it in books</text>
  <text start="2676.16" dur="6.06">find it you go to a conference that you</text>

  <text start="2688.849" dur="8.94">you know you&amp;#39;ll be doing some of that</text>
  <text start="2690.619" dur="11.311">stuff but you can but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="2697.789" dur="6.81">up to you if you don&amp;#39;t have a person</text>

  <text start="2870.56" dur="4.35">lot more time trying to learn from the</text>
  <text start="2873.05" dur="4.86">Holy Spirit taking the dreams that I get</text>

  <text start="2877.91" dur="4.56">this stuff mean what am I supposed to</text>
  <text start="2879.53" dur="5.76">learn from this yeah because then it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2882.47" dur="5.15">personalized and what is the key to my</text>
  <text start="2885.29" dur="5.16">healing because everyone has different</text>
  <text start="2887.62" dur="5.46">roadblocks I would say if they aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2890.45" dur="5.82">getting healed there&amp;#39;s something there</text>
  <text start="2893.08" dur="6.7">that needs to be discovered if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2896.27" dur="5.69">received prayer dozens of people or</text>
  <text start="2899.78" dur="4.02">hundreds of people there is a roadblock</text>
  <text start="2901.96" dur="4.54">especially if the people that are</text>
  <text start="2903.8" dur="4.68">praying for you have a good quit yeah if</text>
  <text start="2906.5" dur="3.93">you&amp;#39;ve gone to Bethel and you&amp;#39;ve gone to</text>

  <text start="2914.75" dur="4.65">still not healed there is something in</text>
  <text start="2917.03" dur="3.87">the way it&amp;#39;s absolutely deeper emotional</text>
  <text start="2919.4" dur="4.02">spring yeah it&amp;#39;s probably emotional</text>
  <text start="2920.9" dur="4.02">trauma it&amp;#39;s probably altars and</text>
  <text start="2923.42" dur="5.81">fragments that need to be integrated and</text>
  <text start="2924.92" dur="7.95">healed is keeping everything messed up</text>
  <text start="2929.23" dur="6.34">yeah and and we are not immune to this</text>
  <text start="2932.87" dur="5.25">you know I I still have some physical</text>
  <text start="2935.57" dur="4.44">issues that I have not been able to get</text>
  <text start="2938.12" dur="3.75">healed and I get triggered once in a</text>
  <text start="2940.01" dur="3.55">while I still have I think so yeah</text>
  <text start="2941.87" dur="4.51">altars they need to be</text>
  <text start="2943.56" dur="6.42">one is probably totally free of this all</text>
  <text start="2946.38" dur="6.78">the time if you&amp;#39;re not walking in the</text>
  <text start="2949.98" dur="6.29">kind of freedom and power and authority</text>
  <text start="2953.16" dur="6.06">that Jesus walked in you&amp;#39;re probably</text>
  <text start="2956.27" dur="5.44">still in need of some degree of</text>
