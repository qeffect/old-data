  <text start="256.38" dur="10.37">going to run for reelection this next</text>
  <text start="262.139" dur="12">story is a little entertaining</text>
  <text start="266.75" dur="13.53">judge Trevor McFadden who is the judge</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="10.471">presiding over the fusion GPS case okay</text>
  <text start="280.28" dur="6.819">fusion GPS attorneys have asked judge</text>
  <text start="284.61" dur="7.29">Trevor McFadden to recuse himself from</text>
  <text start="287.099" dur="8.011">the case want to know why because</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="7.46">they&amp;#39;re saying that Trevor McFadden was</text>
  <text start="295.11" dur="9.869">part of the transition team in 2016 and</text>
  <text start="299.36" dur="7.809">he may be predisposed to having some</text>
  <text start="304.979" dur="4.921">kind of conflict of interest in a case</text>
  <text start="307.169" dur="4.981">where the fusion GPS dossier was</text>
  <text start="309.9" dur="7.199">actually used to surveil people on the</text>
  <text start="312.15" dur="6.6">drug team so imagine the attorneys going</text>
  <text start="317.099" dur="3.961">to court and saying well you know our</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="5.55">dossier led to the Trump transition team</text>
  <text start="321.06" dur="5.97">being illegally surveilled by the FBI</text>
  <text start="324.3" dur="4.709">and the judge is actually one of the</text>
  <text start="327.03" dur="4.979">people that was illegally surveilled so</text>
  <text start="329.009" dur="6.991">we would like him to recuse himself you</text>
  <text start="332.009" dur="7.47">can&amp;#39;t make this stuff up that is</text>
  <text start="336" dur="6.21">actually a motion that the attorneys put</text>
  <text start="339.479" dur="5.97">in court today they would like the judge</text>
  <text start="342.21" dur="6.66">to recuse himself because he was</text>
  <text start="345.449" dur="8.821">probably illegally spied upon by the FBI</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="7.139">due to their dossier good stuff Bruce</text>
  <text start="354.27" dur="6.09">yes it just keeps getting better</text>
  <text start="356.009" dur="7.621">Bruce or who was previously demoted as</text>
  <text start="360.36" dur="6.739">an associate Deputy Attorney General he</text>
  <text start="363.63" dur="6.75">is one of the guys who got together with</text>
  <text start="367.099" dur="6.37">Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson</text>
  <text start="370.38" dur="5.879">from fusion GPS and they put together</text>
  <text start="373.469" dur="6.63">the dossier and Bruce or was probably</text>
  <text start="376.259" dur="5.791">involved in getting it to FISA Court he</text>
  <text start="380.099" dur="4.671">has actually been removed from his</text>
  <text start="382.05" dur="6.839">position as head of organized crime Drug</text>
  <text start="384.77" dur="5.709">Enforcement Task Force so he has been</text>
  <text start="388.889" dur="5.37">stripped of two positions with the</text>
  <text start="390.479" dur="5.37">Department of Justice now I&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="394.259" dur="4.47">surprised if Bruce or doesn&amp;#39;t end up</text>
  <text start="395.849" dur="5.001">going to jail along with come--and</text>
  <text start="398.729" dur="9.441">McCabe and the other crooks</text>
  <text start="400.85" dur="11.29">at the top there is a report out from</text>
  <text start="408.17" dur="9.49">Zero Hedge that says that the Bernie</text>
  <text start="412.14" dur="9.6">Sanders investigation by the FBI into a</text>
  <text start="417.66" dur="6.12">2010 property deal that was mainly</text>
  <text start="421.74" dur="5.25">orchestrated by his wife although Bernie</text>
  <text start="423.78" dur="6.66">was probably part of it right the</text>
  <text start="426.99" dur="5.61">Burlington college that that has</text>
  <text start="430.44" dur="5.43">actually gone before a grand jury now</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="7.05">and that one witness has been asked to</text>
  <text start="435.87" dur="5.28">testify in that case so if this it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="439.65" dur="4.26">difficult to know if grand jury</text>
  <text start="441.15" dur="6.87">investigations but there is an article</text>
  <text start="443.91" dur="6.63">on Zero Hedge it says that there it&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="448.02" dur="4.59">seems like there&amp;#39;s a rival report that</text>
  <text start="450.54" dur="4.5">has gone before a grand jury so we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="452.61" dur="7.14">see what happens with Bernie in the</text>
  <text start="455.04" dur="8.76">future the Clive Bundy case has been</text>
  <text start="459.75" dur="6.65">dismissed by a federal judge today the</text>
  <text start="463.8" dur="6.869">judge dismissed the case with prejudice</text>
  <text start="466.4" dur="6.4">citing prosecutorial misconduct when the</text>
  <text start="470.669" dur="4.021">case is dismissed with prejudice it</text>
  <text start="472.8" dur="3.84">means there cannot be a retrial so</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="4.38">they&amp;#39;re gonna walk there will be no</text>
  <text start="476.64" dur="5.55">further charges in that case that case</text>
  <text start="479.07" dur="6.78">is over they can&amp;#39;t be retried so we got</text>
  <text start="482.19" dur="8.16">some good news out of that I&amp;#39;m happy to</text>
  <text start="485.85" dur="6.81">report that this is coming from next</text>
  <text start="490.35" dur="4.29">report is coming from true pundit there</text>
  <text start="492.66" dur="4.95">is a second report now out of the FBI</text>
  <text start="494.64" dur="4.589">field office in Los Angeles that an</text>
  <text start="497.61" dur="4.47">agent is being accused of sexually</text>
  <text start="499.229" dur="3.391">assaulting a female Justice Department</text>
  <text start="502.08" dur="3.12">attorney</text>
  <text start="502.62" dur="4.62">the woman says an agent put something in</text>
  <text start="505.2" dur="3.66">her drink which made her pass out and</text>
  <text start="507.24" dur="5.94">then she was sexually assaulted</text>
  <text start="508.86" dur="9.96">afterward so trouble for the FBI</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="9.359">continues there is a report coming out</text>
  <text start="518.82" dur="9.15">of Reuters that this is just ironic as</text>
  <text start="522.539" dur="8.281">heck the coalition of nations led by</text>
  <text start="527.97" dur="5.31">Germany that agreed to lower carbon</text>
  <text start="530.82" dur="3.61">dioxide emissions by 40 percent before</text>
  <text start="533.28" dur="4.93">the Year 22</text>
  <text start="534.43" dur="6.659">has pulled out of their agreement they</text>
  <text start="538.21" dur="5.7">didn&amp;#39;t think that it was doable anymore</text>
  <text start="541.089" dur="5.31">and so they&amp;#39;re reorganizing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="543.91" dur="4.05">looking at whether they should keep the</text>
  <text start="546.399" dur="4.471">goal of reducing about 40 percent but</text>
  <text start="547.96" dur="6.96">it&amp;#39;s put it out to 2030 they all got</text>
  <text start="550.87" dur="5.64">cold feet over this thing and I suspect</text>
  <text start="554.92" dur="3.09">part of that has to do with the fact</text>
  <text start="556.51" dur="3.54">that United States has pulled out of it</text>
  <text start="558.01" dur="4.62">and since they&amp;#39;re not gonna get our</text>
  <text start="560.05" dur="4.17">money and since we&amp;#39;re not giving them</text>
  <text start="562.63" dur="4.23">money and it puts us on a more level</text>
  <text start="564.22" dur="5.4">playing field they did not want to be</text>
  <text start="566.86" dur="7.02">hampered anymore with these restrictions</text>
  <text start="569.62" dur="6.42">so they&amp;#39;re out and that is to me is very</text>
  <text start="573.88" dur="3.51">telling that the entire thing was</text>
  <text start="576.04" dur="4.919">probably all about the money in the</text>
  <text start="577.39" dur="7.139">first place and creating a uneven</text>
  <text start="580.959" dur="6.991">playing field economically and once the</text>
  <text start="584.529" dur="7.291">president got us out of that there sham</text>
  <text start="587.95" dur="7.56">kind of got exposed so that is a report</text>
  <text start="591.82" dur="6.65">from Reuters by the way the President</text>
  <text start="595.51" dur="5.31">signed seven bills into law today and</text>
  <text start="598.47" dur="4.15">you probably won&amp;#39;t hear about this from</text>
