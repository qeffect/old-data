  <text start="8.809" dur="5.29">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.88" dur="4.79">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="2.571">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="17.32" dur="4.6">hey everyone how are you doing in this</text>
  <text start="20.3" dur="3.33">message I&amp;#39;d like to do something a</text>
  <text start="21.92" dur="4.89">little different due to the popularity</text>
  <text start="23.63" dur="5.46">of last week&amp;#39;s prophetic update on</text>
  <text start="26.81" dur="4.83">President Trump this week I&amp;#39;ll be giving</text>
  <text start="29.09" dur="5.07">you another update on President Trump</text>
  <text start="31.64" dur="4.59">and specifically Rex Tillerson our new</text>
  <text start="34.16" dur="4.8">Secretary of State today is Friday</text>
  <text start="36.23" dur="5.31">January 3rd and I had a dream last night</text>
  <text start="38.96" dur="4.95">about president Trump and Rex Tillerson</text>
  <text start="41.54" dur="4.44">and a potential problem that may be</text>
  <text start="43.91" dur="3.899">coming in the future before I go into</text>
  <text start="45.98" dur="4.05">the dream I&amp;#39;d like to do a little bit of</text>
  <text start="47.809" dur="4.831">teaching on the nature of dreams and</text>
  <text start="50.03" dur="4.709">what dreams are all about many people in</text>
  <text start="52.64" dur="4.05">the Bible had dreams from God those</text>
  <text start="54.739" dur="4.471">dreams included dreams of Direction</text>
  <text start="56.69" dur="4.32">dreams of warning many times angels of</text>
  <text start="59.21" dur="3.989">God appeared to give people messages and</text>
  <text start="61.01" dur="4.079">dreams I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of dreams over the</text>
  <text start="63.199" dur="3.751">last eight years most of the dreams we</text>
  <text start="65.089" dur="3.871">have are symbolic and most of the dreams</text>
  <text start="66.95" dur="4.41">we have pertained to us the reason why</text>
  <text start="68.96" dur="4.32">God gives us symbolic dreams is to draw</text>
  <text start="71.36" dur="4.71">us into a closer relationship with him</text>
  <text start="73.28" dur="4.769">he wants us to come to him and ask him</text>
  <text start="76.07" dur="3.75">about the meaning of the dreams and the</text>
  <text start="78.049" dur="3.931">only way we can do that is to enter into</text>
  <text start="79.82" dur="4.05">conversation with the Holy Spirit where</text>
  <text start="81.98" dur="4.77">we ask questions and he gives answers</text>
  <text start="83.87" dur="5.25">the interpretation of dreams comes from</text>
  <text start="86.75" dur="4.08">the Lord he gives the dreams and he</text>
  <text start="89.12" dur="3.96">gives us understanding of what they mean</text>
  <text start="90.83" dur="2.82">a lot of people don&amp;#39;t have dreams very</text>
  <text start="93.08" dur="2.67">regularly</text>
  <text start="93.65" dur="3.81">and what I would recommend to them is if</text>
  <text start="95.75" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;re not having dreams right now just</text>
  <text start="97.46" dur="4.17">ask for them and if you don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="99.62" dur="4.17">dream tonight keep asking and if you</text>
  <text start="101.63" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t have a dream tomorrow keep asking</text>
  <text start="103.79" dur="4.92">if you keep asking for revelation from</text>
  <text start="106.7" dur="4.35">God he&amp;#39;ll give it to you when you do</text>
  <text start="108.71" dur="5.01">have dreams try to remember them I</text>
  <text start="111.05" dur="5.49">recommend waking up as soon as you have</text>
  <text start="113.72" dur="4.89">a dream if you can keep something by</text>
  <text start="116.54" dur="5.009">your bed to journal your dreams whether</text>
  <text start="118.61" dur="4.98">you use a a notepad or some people use</text>
  <text start="121.549" dur="4.081">computers however you record your dreams</text>
  <text start="123.59" dur="4.529">is fine but I would recommend having</text>
  <text start="125.63" dur="4.469">some way to record your dreams and make</text>
  <text start="128.119" dur="4.2">a journal of them I&amp;#39;ve noticed that over</text>
  <text start="130.099" dur="4.14">the years the nature of my dreams has</text>
  <text start="132.319" dur="4.23">changed many times when I look back at</text>
  <text start="134.239" dur="5.61">my dreams I&amp;#39;ll find something that</text>
  <text start="136.549" dur="5.61">happened that was shown to me ahead of</text>
  <text start="139.849" dur="3.841">time in a dream but I didn&amp;#39;t realize it</text>
  <text start="142.159" dur="3.87">at the time I only saw it when I looked</text>
  <text start="143.69" dur="4.439">back as we pay attention to our dreams</text>
  <text start="146.029" dur="5.161">as we focus on them as we are obedient</text>
  <text start="148.129" dur="4.561">to them God will give us more dreams</text>
  <text start="151.19" dur="4.56">remember in the parable of the talents</text>
  <text start="152.69" dur="5.04">the Lord gave one talent to a servant</text>
  <text start="155.75" dur="4.32">two talents to another servant and five</text>
  <text start="157.73" dur="3.06">talents to a third servant then he went</text>
  <text start="160.07" dur="2.31">away for a while</text>
  <text start="160.79" dur="2.94">and when he came back he asked the</text>
  <text start="162.38" dur="3.57">servants what they did with their</text>
  <text start="163.73" dur="4.47">talents the servant who had five talents</text>
  <text start="165.95" dur="3.81">made five more the servant who had two</text>
  <text start="168.2" dur="3.72">talents made two more</text>
  <text start="169.76" dur="4.53">they were good stewards they invested</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="4.23">and they multiplied what the Lord had</text>
  <text start="174.29" dur="3.63">given them the servant who had one</text>
  <text start="176.15" dur="3.69">talent buried it in the ground didn&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="177.92" dur="3.96">anything with it so the Lord took that</text>
  <text start="179.84" dur="3.66">talent away and gave it to the one who</text>
  <text start="181.88" dur="4.89">had five well what does that tell us</text>
  <text start="183.5" dur="5.1">that means that if we are faithful if we</text>
  <text start="186.77" dur="5.07">steward if we take what the Lord has</text>
  <text start="188.6" dur="6.39">given us and we use it wisely he will</text>
  <text start="191.84" dur="5.28">give us more so if you get dreams if you</text>
  <text start="194.99" dur="2.52">have visions write them down pray into</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="2.61">them</text>
  <text start="197.51" dur="4.17">do your best to engage God and engage</text>
  <text start="199.73" dur="4.35">his kingdom regarding the revelation you</text>
  <text start="201.68" dur="4.79">receive that kind of dreams you have is</text>
  <text start="204.08" dur="5.58">dependent upon your sphere of influence</text>
  <text start="206.47" dur="6.67">most of us start out having dreams just</text>
  <text start="209.66" dur="6.06">for us dreams that instruct us about our</text>
  <text start="213.14" dur="4.68">gifting our calling maybe some issues</text>
  <text start="215.72" dur="4.26">that we struggle with where the Lord is</text>
  <text start="217.82" dur="4.44">trying to help us grow in our identity</text>
  <text start="219.98" dur="4.44">and understand our relationship with him</text>
  <text start="222.26" dur="4.53">and our relationship to our family and</text>
  <text start="224.42" dur="4.89">friends but as we grow in spiritual</text>
  <text start="226.79" dur="6.12">maturity our sphere of influence grows</text>
  <text start="229.31" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s relational so as we develop a</text>
  <text start="232.91" dur="3.96">larger sphere of influence a larger</text>
  <text start="234.92" dur="3.96">circle of friends we may start having</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="4.05">dreams about other people sometimes</text>
  <text start="238.88" dur="3.99">those dreams are prophetic revelation</text>
  <text start="240.92" dur="4.349">that our instructional directional or</text>
  <text start="242.87" dur="4.44">dreams and encourage other people when I</text>
  <text start="245.269" dur="3.72">first started having dreams most of them</text>
  <text start="247.31" dur="3.84">were related to the subject of healing</text>
  <text start="248.989" dur="3.241">but I also have a lot of dreams that are</text>
  <text start="251.15" dur="3.39">related to politics</text>
  <text start="252.23" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s my Metron or my sphere of</text>
  <text start="254.54" dur="4.5">influence so the Lord has given me quite</text>
  <text start="257.45" dur="3.48">a few dreams about politics over the</text>
  <text start="259.04" dur="3.51">last few years and in the last six</text>
  <text start="260.93" dur="4.44">months many of those dreams have been</text>
  <text start="262.55" dur="4.92">about Donald Trump if you follow my blog</text>
  <text start="265.37" dur="5.46">if you listen to my podcasts you know</text>
  <text start="267.47" dur="5.43">that I&amp;#39;m very interested in what the</text>
  <text start="270.83" dur="5.01">Lord is saying about Donald Trump as</text>
  <text start="272.9" dur="4.89">I&amp;#39;ve said before I was not initially a</text>
  <text start="275.84" dur="2.94">Donald Trump supporter when I first</text>
  <text start="277.79" dur="4.08">heard that he was running for president</text>
  <text start="278.78" dur="5.04">I was supporting someone else but during</text>
  <text start="281.87" dur="3.12">the election campaign I asked the Lord</text>
  <text start="283.82" dur="3.51">to give me rev</text>
  <text start="284.99" dur="4.74">elation about who he wanted to be</text>
  <text start="287.33" dur="4.56">president about his pic and he chose</text>
  <text start="289.73" dur="4.26">someone different so rather than stick</text>
  <text start="291.89" dur="4.23">with my own candidate I got on board</text>
  <text start="293.99" dur="4.62">with the candidate that I believe the</text>
  <text start="296.12" dur="4.74">Lord wanted to become president and I</text>
  <text start="298.61" dur="3.9">believe that is Donald Trump my friends</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="3.6">and I have had hundreds of dreams about</text>
  <text start="302.51" dur="3.54">Donald Trump and it&amp;#39;s interesting</text>
  <text start="304.46" dur="3.96">because in many of the dreams</text>
  <text start="306.05" dur="4.65">Donald Trump has portrayed in ways that</text>
  <text start="308.42" dur="4.8">you can&amp;#39;t see in the natural and the</text>
  <text start="310.7" dur="6.78">natural people tend to see him as gruff</text>
  <text start="313.22" dur="6.39">unpolished insensitive harsh but in the</text>
  <text start="317.48" dur="4.74">dreams that people have had almost all</text>
  <text start="319.61" dur="6">of them portray him to be a very kind</text>
  <text start="322.22" dur="6">a very warm loving sincere even very</text>
  <text start="325.61" dur="4.8">spiritual person the dreams portray him</text>
  <text start="328.22" dur="4.32">very differently from how he is</text>
  <text start="330.41" dur="5.07">portrayed by the media and how people</text>
  <text start="332.54" dur="6.03">perceive him externally I was initially</text>
  <text start="335.48" dur="5.19">reluctant to talk much about the dreams</text>
  <text start="338.57" dur="4.35">that I&amp;#39;ve had about Donald Trump but I</text>
  <text start="340.67" dur="4.86">realized I needed to be obedient to the</text>
  <text start="342.92" dur="4.89">revelation that God has given me now a</text>
  <text start="345.53" dur="4.29">lot of people who follow my podcasts</text>
  <text start="347.81" dur="4.95">read my books and read my articles</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="4.8">prefer to have me writing and talking</text>
  <text start="352.76" dur="3.81">about healing and the supernatural I</text>
  <text start="354.62" dur="4.14">love writing about those things and I</text>
  <text start="356.57" dur="4.56">love talking about them but I feel like</text>
  <text start="358.76" dur="4.92">I have to be obedient to the revelation</text>
  <text start="361.13" dur="4.5">God is giving me and right now a lot of</text>
  <text start="363.68" dur="4.26">that revelation has to do with politics</text>
  <text start="365.63" dur="5.16">the podcast I did last week</text>
  <text start="367.94" dur="5.34">was very popular it was shared a lot on</text>
  <text start="370.79" dur="3.96">social media and it seems like there are</text>
  <text start="373.28" dur="4.05">a lot of people who are interested in</text>
  <text start="374.75" dur="4.59">this subject so this week I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="377.33" dur="4.83">provide another prophetic update</text>
  <text start="379.34" dur="4.17">undaunted Trump is administration there</text>
  <text start="382.16" dur="3.36">are a lot of people who don&amp;#39;t believe</text>
  <text start="383.51" dur="4.38">that God is interested in politics or in</text>
  <text start="385.52" dur="3.99">the kingdoms of Earth I believe that God</text>
  <text start="387.89" dur="3.69">is interested in politics</text>
  <text start="389.51" dur="4.01">I believe he sets up leaders and rulers</text>
  <text start="391.58" dur="5.64">in the earth to accomplish his goals</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="5.92">Romans 13 verse 1 says everyone must</text>
  <text start="397.22" dur="4.26">submit to governing authorities all</text>
  <text start="399.44" dur="3.78">authority comes from God and those who</text>
  <text start="401.48" dur="3.99">are in positions of authority had been</text>
  <text start="403.22" dur="4.62">placed there by God the Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="405.47" dur="5.04">tells us to pray for our leaders and</text>
  <text start="407.84" dur="5.28">that leaders are established by God I do</text>
  <text start="410.51" dur="4.92">believe that God places leaders in</text>
  <text start="413.12" dur="4.08">positions of authority to accomplish his</text>
  <text start="415.43" dur="3.4">will and I happen to be one of the</text>
  <text start="417.2" dur="4.03">people who&amp;#39;s receiving revelation</text>
  <text start="418.83" dur="3.81">from God about one particularly der so</text>
  <text start="421.23" dur="2.61">if you&amp;#39;re interested in politics or if</text>
  <text start="422.64" dur="3.03">you&amp;#39;re interested in prophetic</text>
  <text start="423.84" dur="3.54">revelation about Donald Trump you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="425.67" dur="3.9">seeing a lot more of that in my messages</text>
  <text start="427.38" dur="3.78">in the future a couple of months ago I</text>
  <text start="429.57" dur="3.63">began following a guy named Adam</text>
  <text start="431.16" dur="3.72">Gingrich who goes by the name of John</text>
  <text start="433.2" dur="3.81">wick of politics on Twitter</text>
  <text start="434.88" dur="4.26">Adam is what I would call a political</text>
  <text start="437.01" dur="4.29">insider he has worked in the world of</text>
  <text start="439.14" dur="5.28">politics for twenty years he is very</text>
  <text start="441.3" dur="5.64">well versed in politics and how a</text>
  <text start="444.42" dur="4.56">political scene is run both nationally</text>
  <text start="446.94" dur="4.29">and on the state level Adam does</text>
  <text start="448.98" dur="3.57">periscope updates about three times a</text>
  <text start="451.23" dur="3.39">week and my wife and I have been</text>
  <text start="452.55" dur="4.26">listening to his periscopes for a couple</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="3.9">of months he is very insightful has a</text>
  <text start="456.81" dur="4.26">lot of great information he&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="458.52" dur="5.61">few political insiders who&amp;#39;s willing to</text>
  <text start="461.07" dur="4.83">talk publicly about what goes on at the</text>
  <text start="464.13" dur="3.45">state and at the national level in</text>
  <text start="465.9" dur="3.81">politics when I tuned into his</text>
  <text start="467.58" dur="4.35">periscopes I learned a lot about what is</text>
  <text start="469.71" dur="4.02">happening on a weekly basis with votes</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="2.28">what&amp;#39;s going on in the House and the</text>
  <text start="473.73" dur="1.8">Senate</text>
  <text start="474.21" dur="2.85">so if you&amp;#39;re interested in learning a</text>
  <text start="475.53" dur="4.14">little bit more about politics I would</text>
  <text start="477.06" dur="4.86">definitely recommend tuning into Adams</text>
  <text start="479.67" dur="4.2">periscopes I will leave links in the</text>
  <text start="481.92" dur="4.14">podcast notes for people who need some</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="4.38">help finding that adam has also found</text>
  <text start="486.06" dur="4.71">that there&amp;#39;s a growing interest in</text>
  <text start="488.25" dur="4.35">politics even after the election and</text>
  <text start="490.77" dur="4.29">this is an interesting phenomenon</text>
  <text start="492.6" dur="4.53">normally after a presidential election</text>
  <text start="495.06" dur="4.11">there isn&amp;#39;t a sustained interest in</text>
  <text start="497.13" dur="4.53">politics but this year in particular</text>
  <text start="499.17" dur="3.93">there are a lot more people who are</text>
  <text start="501.66" dur="3.93">interested in what is happening</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="5.4">politically I found myself tuning into</text>
  <text start="505.59" dur="5.19">Sean Spicer&amp;#39;s daily press conference</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="4.02">updates on Facebook just because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="510.78" dur="3.12">interested in what is going on in the</text>
  <text start="512.52" dur="3.45">White House and what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="513.9" dur="3.99">Trump administration it seems like there</text>
  <text start="515.97" dur="3.3">are a lot more people who are interested</text>
  <text start="517.89" dur="3.72">in what is happening in the political</text>
  <text start="519.27" dur="4.86">world part of that I think is because</text>
  <text start="521.61" dur="5.13">Donald Trump is such a populist</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="4.14">candidate he was on a reality TV show so</text>
  <text start="526.74" dur="4.11">a lot of people are familiar with him</text>
  <text start="528.27" dur="4.92">and a lot of people don&amp;#39;t like him but</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="3.99">obviously there are a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="533.19" dur="3.42">do like him and I think he&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="534.84" dur="4.56">a great leader and in my opinion the</text>
  <text start="536.61" dur="5.13">press has made him a hot topic when he</text>
  <text start="539.4" dur="4.2">first announced his candidacy the press</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="3.84">did their best to try to cast him in a</text>
  <text start="543.6" dur="4.41">bad light it seems like everything that</text>
  <text start="545.58" dur="4.59">press did to try to make Trump look like</text>
  <text start="548.01" dur="4.59">an illegitimate candidate backfired</text>
  <text start="550.17" dur="5.219">that&amp;#39;s why he ended up being president</text>
  <text start="552.6" dur="5.969">they gave him just enough publicity - I</text>
  <text start="555.389" dur="4.5">think draw some sympathy from voters who</text>
  <text start="558.569" dur="4.171">felt like he was being treated unfairly</text>
  <text start="559.889" dur="5.461">it&amp;#39;s no secret that the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="562.74" dur="5.01">is losing favor and one of the things</text>
  <text start="565.35" dur="5.159">that Adam Gingrich is doing with his new</text>
  <text start="567.75" dur="5.069">website Wikimedia Nation he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="570.509" dur="4.651">collaborating with some friends who are</text>
  <text start="572.819" dur="5.311">going to create a platform to talk about</text>
  <text start="575.16" dur="4.59">politics and international news they</text>
  <text start="578.13" dur="2.79">want to provide a different view of</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="4.079">what&amp;#39;s happening in the world of</text>
  <text start="580.92" dur="5.19">politics as part of the new media people</text>
  <text start="583.829" dur="4.411">like Adam and myself are creating these</text>
  <text start="586.11" dur="3.899">platforms where we are giving people</text>
  <text start="588.24" dur="3.719">information about politics and</text>
  <text start="590.009" dur="3.481">international news that kind of falls</text>
  <text start="591.959" dur="3.87">outside the realm of the mainstream</text>
  <text start="593.49" dur="4.11">media and that brings us to the subject</text>
  <text start="595.829" dur="3.721">of my dream last night if you&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="597.6" dur="4.289">following news you know that there is a</text>
  <text start="599.55" dur="5.039">growing controversy between China and</text>
  <text start="601.889" dur="4.051">the United States regarding the islands</text>
  <text start="604.589" dur="3.3">that they&amp;#39;ve been building up in the</text>
  <text start="605.94" dur="3.839">South China Sea the territory in the</text>
  <text start="607.889" dur="4.021">South China Sea is international</text>
  <text start="609.779" dur="4.321">territory but China has been building</text>
  <text start="611.91" dur="4.979">man-made islands complete with air</text>
  <text start="614.1" dur="5.07">strips and anti-aircraft artillery there</text>
  <text start="616.889" dur="5.19">are many nations who have claims to this</text>
  <text start="619.17" dur="4.56">territory but China is the only one that</text>
  <text start="622.079" dur="4.56">has gone ahead and seems to be</text>
  <text start="623.73" dur="5.789">developing it with plans to use it for</text>
  <text start="626.639" dur="5.55">industry and potentially for military as</text>
  <text start="629.519" dur="4.68">Adam pointed out in his periscope last</text>
  <text start="632.189" dur="4.38">night one of the first things that Rex</text>
  <text start="634.199" dur="4.771">Tillerson as a Secretary of State is</text>
  <text start="636.569" dur="4.801">going to have to do is confront China</text>
  <text start="638.97" dur="4.739">over the buildup in the South China Sea</text>
  <text start="641.37" dur="3.87">in international territory China is</text>
  <text start="643.709" dur="4.141">trying to claim this territory for</text>
  <text start="645.24" dur="4.56">itself and if the United States and</text>
  <text start="647.85" dur="3.96">other nations allow them to do that it</text>
  <text start="649.8" dur="4.38">severely restricts the ability for</text>
  <text start="651.81" dur="5.009">companies and nations to do</text>
  <text start="654.18" dur="5.639">international trade so Tillerson as</text>
  <text start="656.819" dur="6.901">Secretary of State needs to find a way</text>
  <text start="659.819" dur="6.051">to confront China to get them to</text>
  <text start="663.72" dur="4.53">negotiate and come off of this position</text>
  <text start="665.87" dur="3.67">on these islands that they built up and</text>
  <text start="668.25" dur="3.93">that is going to be a very difficult</text>
  <text start="669.54" dur="4.469">proposition because China has spent a</text>
  <text start="672.18" dur="4.529">lot of money and a lot of time building</text>
  <text start="674.009" dur="5.611">these islands the situation in the South</text>
  <text start="676.709" dur="4.651">China Sea has a potential to create war</text>
  <text start="679.62" dur="3.959">between China and the United States and</text>
  <text start="681.36" dur="3.27">that is something that nobody wants to</text>
  <text start="683.579" dur="4.111">see happen</text>
  <text start="684.63" dur="5.189">last night I had a dream where I saw a</text>
  <text start="687.69" dur="4.11">number of president Trump&amp;#39;s cabinet</text>
  <text start="689.819" dur="4.861">members and they were taking heat over</text>
  <text start="691.8" dur="5.07">various issues the main person that I</text>
  <text start="694.68" dur="4.079">saw in the dream was Rex Tillerson he</text>
  <text start="696.87" dur="4.339">was coming under quite a bit of fire</text>
  <text start="698.759" dur="5.13">both from the press and from</text>
  <text start="701.209" dur="4.87">international leaders over a position</text>
  <text start="703.889" dur="4.291">that he took on an issue and I think it</text>
  <text start="706.079" dur="4.26">has to do with its South China Sea the</text>
  <text start="708.18" dur="4.98">interesting thing about the dream was I</text>
  <text start="710.339" dur="4.831">saw how President Trump supported Rex</text>
  <text start="713.16" dur="4.53">Tillerson now if you know much about</text>
  <text start="715.17" dur="5.01">politics you know that a lot of</text>
  <text start="717.69" dur="5.43">political leaders will gauge their</text>
  <text start="720.18" dur="5.25">responses based on how they think</text>
  <text start="723.12" dur="4.829">they&amp;#39;re going to be perceived by voters</text>
  <text start="725.43" dur="4.62">because for most politicians it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="727.949" dur="4.681">about maintaining popularity with voters</text>
  <text start="730.05" dur="3.51">if you lose popularity with voters you</text>
  <text start="732.63" dur="2.639">don&amp;#39;t get reelected</text>
  <text start="733.56" dur="3.87">well Donald Trump is not an average</text>
  <text start="735.269" dur="4.951">politician I&amp;#39;ve noticed in watching him</text>
  <text start="737.43" dur="5.73">that he tends to be very loyal even if</text>
  <text start="740.22" dur="5.609">it causes him some unpopularity and in</text>
  <text start="743.16" dur="4.979">the dream Donald Trump was fiercely</text>
  <text start="745.829" dur="3.87">loyal to Rex Tillerson he displayed a</text>
  <text start="748.139" dur="4.5">lot more loyalty than you would expect</text>
  <text start="749.699" dur="4.89">from a regular politician Trump was</text>
  <text start="752.639" dur="4.021">backing Tillerson to the hilt on his</text>
  <text start="754.589" dur="3.961">position and in the dream that seemed to</text>
  <text start="756.66" dur="4.02">give Tillerson a lot of confidence in</text>
  <text start="758.55" dur="5.01">taking the position that he needed to I</text>
  <text start="760.68" dur="5.099">think the dream is a prophetic look at</text>
  <text start="763.56" dur="4.649">one of the issues we&amp;#39;re gonna see in the</text>
  <text start="765.779" dur="4.351">next few weeks which is as Rex steps</text>
  <text start="768.209" dur="4.201">into his position as Secretary of State</text>
  <text start="770.13" dur="4.92">he is going to have to face down China</text>
  <text start="772.41" dur="4.95">with this issue and I think we need to</text>
  <text start="775.05" dur="3.87">pray for president Trump for Rex</text>
  <text start="777.36" dur="3.599">Tillerson I think we need to pray for</text>
  <text start="778.92" dur="4.89">the entire administration that they</text>
  <text start="780.959" dur="4.591">would be given divine insights that they</text>
  <text start="783.81" dur="3.81">would be given a wisdom that they would</text>
  <text start="785.55" dur="4.95">be given patience to navigate these</text>
  <text start="787.62" dur="5.04">waters carefully firmly and fairly</text>
  <text start="790.5" dur="3.959">without DES saying or doing anything</text>
  <text start="792.66" dur="2.869">that&amp;#39;s going to cause a war I think we</text>
  <text start="794.459" dur="3.451">also need to be praying for</text>
  <text start="795.529" dur="4.631">international leaders leaders in Europe</text>
  <text start="797.91" dur="4.44">and leaders in China as the South China</text>
  <text start="800.16" dur="4.38">Sea becomes an international issue of</text>
  <text start="802.35" dur="4.32">greater concern I think we all need to</text>
  <text start="804.54" dur="4.229">be in prayer over the situation I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="806.67" dur="3.93">going to leave it up to you to be led by</text>
  <text start="808.769" dur="4.62">the Holy Spirit but I would ask you to</text>
