  <text start="113.759" dur="5.601">to do live broadcasts on YouTube</text>
  <text start="115.71" dur="6.72">periscope and Facebook simultaneously</text>
  <text start="119.36" dur="7.75">it&amp;#39;s a little difficult to do three live</text>

  <text start="140.67" dur="6.63">something about Jerry Nadler poor</text>
  <text start="145.17" dur="5.01">representative Jerry Nadler who so badly</text>
  <text start="147.3" dur="6.18">wants Trump impeached along with Adam</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="5.46">Schiff Maxine Waters they would all love</text>
  <text start="153.48" dur="3.12">to all of trumps enemies would love to</text>
  <text start="155.64" dur="4.62">see him impeached</text>
  <text start="156.6" dur="8.1">however they have very little chance of</text>
  <text start="160.26" dur="6.12">seeing that happen Hank I said it</text>
  <text start="164.7" dur="30.27">wouldn&amp;#39;t screaming about volume on</text>

  <text start="207.15" dur="2.79">cool</text>
  <text start="207.75" dur="5.94">sorry about that trying something new</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="6.09">I&amp;#39;m using Denise&amp;#39;s mobile device and I</text>
  <text start="213.69" dur="8.549">don&amp;#39;t normally broadcast with her device</text>
  <text start="216.03" dur="8.31">so anyway so Jerry Nadler this morning</text>
  <text start="222.239" dur="6.681">this afternoon depending on where you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="224.34" dur="8.07">at has said he believes there is cause</text>
  <text start="228.92" dur="5.65">to impeach Trump but the public is not</text>
  <text start="232.41" dur="5.13">aware of it that public doesn&amp;#39;t support</text>
  <text start="234.57" dur="6.66">impeaching Trump because they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="8.669">aware of the alleged crimes that Trump</text>
  <text start="241.23" dur="7.83">has supposedly committed so Nadler is</text>
  <text start="246.209" dur="4.53">saying he needs to have investigations</text>
  <text start="249.06" dur="3.06">he needs to have a hearing so they can</text>
  <text start="250.739" dur="3.451">bring out the information so they can</text>
  <text start="252.12" dur="4.29">red pill the public so they can impeach</text>
  <text start="254.19" dur="3.359">the president because you can&amp;#39;t very</text>
  <text start="256.41" dur="2.129">well in the peach the president if you</text>
  <text start="257.549" dur="4.291">don&amp;#39;t have public support</text>
  <text start="258.539" dur="4.981">so Nadler and Nancy Pelosi I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="261.84" dur="4.68">if Nancy supportiveness now</text>
  <text start="263.52" dur="4.709">wants to have more public hearings so</text>
  <text start="266.52" dur="4.829">that they can get information out there</text>
  <text start="268.229" dur="6.271">that will hopefully reveal crimes of</text>
  <text start="271.349" dur="4.801">President Trump of course their mother</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="5.729">investigation didn&amp;#39;t work there were no</text>
  <text start="276.15" dur="8.78">crimes Muller trots out there couple</text>
  <text start="280.229" dur="9.211">days ago and I think I think Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="284.93" dur="7.389">press conference was probably designed</text>
  <text start="289.44" dur="7.259">to continue to give them in from a</text>
  <text start="292.319" dur="9">reason to call forward Pietschmann and</text>
  <text start="296.699" dur="7.951">that&amp;#39;s just my that&amp;#39;s just my feeling so</text>
  <text start="301.319" dur="7.47">it is interesting because we are in an</text>
  <text start="304.65" dur="8.43">information war this is in every respect</text>
  <text start="308.789" dur="6.901">it&amp;#39;s an information war people like Adam</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="5.059">Schiff and Nadler are trying to get</text>
  <text start="315.69" dur="6.509">information into the public</text>
  <text start="318.139" dur="7.12">consciousness that makes Trump look evil</text>
  <text start="322.199" dur="6.21">and of course what the president is</text>
  <text start="325.259" dur="5.641">doing he is going to declassify all</text>
  <text start="328.409" dur="4.891">these documents related to the invest</text>
  <text start="330.9" dur="3.06">the investigation into him and his</text>
  <text start="333.3" dur="2.58">campaign</text>
  <text start="333.96" dur="6.6">all right so Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="335.88" dur="7.8">declassify all these documents what is</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="5.46">the purpose of declassification the</text>
  <text start="343.68" dur="6.78">purpose of declassification is to make</text>
  <text start="346.02" dur="8.91">public all the information that people</text>
  <text start="350.46" dur="7.22">need to see the corruption in the</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="6.599">intelligence agencies the FBI the CIA</text>
  <text start="357.68" dur="7.239">the Obama White House how they colluded</text>
  <text start="361.529" dur="5.781">right so they accused Trump of collusion</text>
  <text start="364.919" dur="5.9">and they were colluding themselves and</text>
  <text start="367.31" dur="6.219">declassification is going to demonstrate</text>
  <text start="370.819" dur="5.021">factually so that people can see the</text>
  <text start="373.529" dur="4.89">documents people are going to see the</text>
  <text start="375.84" dur="5.28">intelligence briefing information that</text>
  <text start="378.419" dur="5.37">was given to the House Intelligence</text>
  <text start="381.12" dur="5.729">Committee the information that Adam</text>
  <text start="383.789" dur="6.18">Schiff and Devin Nunez had when they</text>
  <text start="386.849" dur="5.81">were briefed on this situation we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="389.969" dur="7.391">going to see the same things they saw</text>
  <text start="392.659" dur="7.521">there will be some redactions to</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="5.1">protect sources and methods and anything</text>
  <text start="400.18" dur="7.579">that&amp;#39;s in an ongoing investigation jury</text>
  <text start="402.46" dur="7.919">grand jury matters but the president is</text>
  <text start="407.759" dur="9.101">declassifying things to make the public</text>
  <text start="410.379" dur="8.401">aware of what happened so you have the</text>
  <text start="416.86" dur="5.01">president&amp;#39;s enemies trying to get</text>
  <text start="418.78" dur="6.359">information out and their hearings are</text>
  <text start="421.87" dur="5.37">to try to further smear Trump d-class is</text>
  <text start="425.139" dur="4.291">going to help us it&amp;#39;s going to help give</text>
  <text start="427.24" dur="4.56">us a can and share with our friends so</text>
  <text start="429.43" dur="3.989">we can red pill people and let them know</text>

  <text start="459.219" dur="5.76">transcript one of the interesting things</text>
  <text start="463.09" dur="7.069">from the transcript is the interviewer</text>
  <text start="464.979" dur="9.271">asked Barr about declassification and</text>
  <text start="470.159" dur="6.81">Barr said I asked the president if I</text>
  <text start="474.25" dur="7.889">could be given authority to request</text>
  <text start="476.969" dur="10.57">declassification all right so Barr said</text>
  <text start="482.139" dur="7.471">it was his idea to ask Trump if he could</text>
  <text start="487.539" dur="4.651">be given authorization to declassify</text>
  <text start="489.61" dur="5.01">whatever he wanted and he told Trump</text>
  <text start="492.19" dur="6.319">tell the heads of all the intelligence</text>
  <text start="494.62" dur="6">agencies and the Defense Department and</text>
  <text start="498.509" dur="5.051">Department of Energy and every other</text>
  <text start="500.62" dur="6.78">agency you tell them they have to</text>
  <text start="503.56" dur="6.63">cooperate with me whatever I asked to be</text>
  <text start="507.4" dur="5.24">declassified you tell them I have</text>
  <text start="510.19" dur="5.279">authorization to declassify it and Barr</text>
  <text start="512.64" dur="5.139">told this in his interview that he</text>
  <text start="515.469" dur="4.68">specifically went to Trump and said I</text>
  <text start="517.779" dur="4.62">want authority to declassify anything I</text>
  <text start="520.149" dur="4.141">feel is necessary and I want you to tell</text>
  <text start="522.399" dur="4.741">those agency heads they have to</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="5.34">cooperate with me that was why the D</text>
  <text start="527.14" dur="3.9">class came about because Barr went to</text>
  <text start="529.63" dur="4.38">trump and said this is what I</text>
  <text start="531.04" dur="5.13">at least that&amp;#39;s what bar is saying he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="534.01" dur="4.44">saying it was his idea to go now look</text>
  <text start="536.17" dur="2.97">bar started out as an attorney with the</text>

  <text start="558.34" dur="6.48">of things if Barr said I&amp;#39;m already</text>
  <text start="561.76" dur="6.09">getting messages from people who are</text>
  <text start="564.82" dur="10.44">concerned and they&amp;#39;re fearful because</text>
  <text start="567.85" dur="11.55">Barr said that he did not consider what</text>

  <text start="680.019" dur="7.28">now going live again</text>

  <text start="687.299" dur="8.2">we were back live on periscope</text>
  <text start="690.54" dur="11.349">technology freezes up alright so as I</text>
  <text start="695.499" dur="11.101">was saying bar has said publicly it was</text>
  <text start="701.889" dur="5.63">his idea to do the the declassification</text>
  <text start="706.6" dur="3.419">this way</text>
  <text start="707.519" dur="4.42">normally when documents are Declassified</text>
  <text start="710.019" dur="4.951">it goes through the office of Director</text>
  <text start="711.939" dur="4.56">of National Intelligence and the DNI</text>
  <text start="714.97" dur="4.849">decides what is gonna be declassified</text>
  <text start="716.499" dur="6.84">how it&amp;#39;s gonna be redacted alright and</text>
  <text start="719.819" dur="7.77">it didn&amp;#39;t happen that way because this</text>
  <text start="723.339" dur="7.05">is primarily about prosecution of crimes</text>
  <text start="727.589" dur="5.081">Trump and Barr decided the</text>
  <text start="730.389" dur="4.14">declassification authority goes to the</text>
  <text start="732.67" dur="4.019">Attorney General he is going to</text>
  <text start="734.529" dur="4.98">prosecute and he needs to have the</text>
  <text start="736.689" dur="5.73">authority to look into any documents</text>
  <text start="739.509" dur="4.95">that he wants so he told Trump tell the</text>
  <text start="742.419" dur="6.66">agency heads they have to cooperate with</text>
  <text start="744.459" dur="9.271">me right got some more comments from bar</text>
  <text start="749.079" dur="6.42">here and it&amp;#39;s a pretty pretty lengthy</text>
  <text start="753.73" dur="3">interview who covers a lot about the</text>
  <text start="755.499" dur="2.43">Muller investigation and things that</text>
  <text start="756.73" dur="3.839">nature I&amp;#39;m not going to go into that</text>
  <text start="757.929" dur="8.041">because I don&amp;#39;t think that information</text>
  <text start="760.569" dur="8.19">is all that helpful there is all right</text>
  <text start="765.97" dur="6.779">no people have been concerned about</text>
  <text start="768.759" dur="7.19">Chris Rea and I&amp;#39;m going to point you to</text>
  <text start="772.749" dur="7.92">an article this is an article that Q</text>
  <text start="775.949" dur="6.79">posted a link to it back in an April</text>
  <text start="780.669" dur="5.4">10th I think if I&amp;#39;m remembering this</text>

  <text start="797.619" dur="6.27">you remember all this outrage fake</text>
  <text start="800.259" dur="5.571">outrage really about bars use of the</text>
  <text start="803.889" dur="3.471">word spying</text>
  <text start="805.83" dur="3.69">spying has been used by the media and</text>

  <text start="824.93" dur="5.02">frankly to the extent that there were</text>
  <text start="826.98" dur="4.5">issues at the FBI I do not view it as a</text>
  <text start="829.95" dur="3.66">problem of the FBI I think it was</text>
  <text start="831.48" dur="5.16">primarily a failure of the group of</text>
  <text start="833.61" dur="4.41">leaders the upper echelon of the FBI I</text>
  <text start="836.64" dur="3.24">think the FBI is an outstanding</text>
  <text start="838.02" dur="4.86">organization I&amp;#39;m very pleased that</text>
  <text start="839.88" dur="5.34">director Chris Rea is there wait a</text>
  <text start="842.88" dur="4.41">minute Barra is saying that he&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="845.22" dur="3.9">pleased that dr. Chris raised there all</text>
  <text start="847.29" dur="5.94">right he added if he becomes necessary</text>
  <text start="849.12" dur="6.21">to look over former officials expect to</text>
  <text start="853.23" dur="3.87">rely on Chris Rea and work with him I</text>
  <text start="855.33" dur="4.38">have an obligation to make sure that</text>
  <text start="857.1" dur="3.99">government power is not abused and I</text>
  <text start="859.71" dur="5.48">think that&amp;#39;s one of the principal roles</text>
  <text start="861.09" dur="6.87">of the Attorney General all right so</text>
  <text start="865.19" dur="8.68">that is just a little snippet of what</text>
  <text start="867.96" dur="7.5">bar said about Chris Rea now a lot of</text>
  <text start="873.87" dur="4.47">people have been concerned because there</text>
  <text start="875.46" dur="5.82">have been statements about Chris Rea in</text>
  <text start="878.34" dur="4.53">the media where people are expressing</text>
  <text start="881.28" dur="4.89">concern that Chris rate is not</text>

  <text start="886.17" dur="3.48">department heads are not cooperating</text>
  <text start="887.34" dur="4.65">with bar and I&amp;#39;m going to tell you this</text>
  <text start="889.65" dur="2.85">is really a lot of concern trolling is</text>
  <text start="891.99" dur="2.61">what it is</text>
  <text start="892.5" dur="3.69">you have people in the media who are</text>
  <text start="894.6" dur="2.88">trying to get clicks they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="896.19" dur="3.75">get follows and they&amp;#39;re trying to get</text>
  <text start="897.48" dur="3.84">YouTube hang on their every word and the</text>
  <text start="899.94" dur="4.14">way they do that is they get you</text>
  <text start="901.32" dur="4.77">concerned unnecessarily that something</text>
  <text start="904.08" dur="3.9">is not right something&amp;#39;s going wrong</text>
  <text start="906.09" dur="3.6">Chris Ray is not cooperating with the</text>
  <text start="907.98" dur="4.35">investigation Chris Ray&amp;#39;s hiding</text>
  <text start="909.69" dur="4.23">information he&amp;#39;s not giving bar the</text>
  <text start="912.33" dur="2.58">information he wants you&amp;#39;ve heard if</text>
  <text start="913.92" dur="7.88">you&amp;#39;ve been paying attention you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="914.91" dur="9.72">heard all this all right and right so</text>
  <text start="921.8" dur="5.61">some of that is in context of a bar</text>
  <text start="924.63" dur="5.49">saying that he has been questioning</text>
  <text start="927.41" dur="4.18">people at the FBI and a DOJ and he says</text>
  <text start="930.12" dur="2.46">some of the things I&amp;#39;m hearing or not</text>
  <text start="931.59" dur="3.93">hanging together they&amp;#39;re not making</text>
  <text start="932.58" dur="5.07">sense I&amp;#39;m not getting answers that make</text>
  <text start="935.52" dur="4.86">everything add up which is his way of</text>
  <text start="937.65" dur="5.13">saying look there&amp;#39;s people that are high</text>
  <text start="940.38" dur="5.31">and they&amp;#39;re making excuses and are</text>
  <text start="942.78" dur="5.85">obfuscating alright and he talks again</text>
  <text start="945.69" dur="6.27">about the he says I think it&amp;#39;s primarily</text>
  <text start="948.63" dur="5.49">a failure of the old leadership in the</text>
  <text start="951.96" dur="4.43">upper and the upper echelon who kind of</text>
  <text start="954.12" dur="4.52">screwed up it&amp;#39;s not the rank-and-file</text>
  <text start="956.39" dur="9.34">all right</text>
  <text start="958.64" dur="9.1">and then bar says small group senior</text>
  <text start="965.73" dur="3.96">level I don&amp;#39;t view it as a bureau wide</text>
  <text start="967.74" dur="5.25">issue and I say the same thing for other</text>
  <text start="969.69" dur="6.06">intelligence agencies they&amp;#39;re being very</text>
  <text start="972.99" dur="3.96">cooperative and helping us and the</text>
  <text start="975.75" dur="5.45">interviewer says they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="976.95" dur="7.8">cooperative and Barr said yes as a</text>
  <text start="981.2" dur="6.7">alright and so Barr confirmed to her</text>
  <text start="984.75" dur="6.9">that heads of other agencies are</text>
  <text start="987.9" dur="8.04">cooperating with his investigation then</text>
  <text start="991.65" dur="6.18">we have this word treason and she asks</text>
  <text start="995.94" dur="4.56">do you think that the people that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="997.83" dur="4.44">talking about committed treason and Barr</text>
  <text start="1000.5" dur="4.05">says as a lawyer I always interpret the</text>
  <text start="1002.27" dur="4.83">word treason not colloquially but</text>
  <text start="1004.55" dur="5.25">legally and you know there&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="1007.1" dur="4.2">specific criteria for treason so I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1009.8" dur="3.84">think it&amp;#39;s actually implicated in the</text>
  <text start="1011.3" dur="4.14">situation we have now she says you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1013.64" dur="5.49">think they committed treason Barr says</text>
  <text start="1015.44" dur="5.34">not a no not as a legal matter but you</text>
  <text start="1019.13" dur="4.26">have concerns about the way they</text>
  <text start="1020.78" dur="4.98">conducted the investigation of Trump he</text>
  <text start="1023.39" dur="5.069">says yes but when you&amp;#39;re dealing with a</text>
  <text start="1025.76" dur="4.71">official government contact intent is</text>
  <text start="1028.459" dur="3.541">frequently murkly murky issue so I</text>
  <text start="1030.47" dur="4.59">already have people this morning sending</text>
  <text start="1032" dur="4.62">me messages saying that&amp;#39;s it that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="1035.06" dur="4.95">this whole treason thing is off because</text>
  <text start="1036.62" dur="5.49">Barr is not willing to say publicly that</text>
  <text start="1040.01" dur="5.22">he said that he believes these people</text>
  <text start="1042.11" dur="6.11">are guilty of treason alright so again</text>
  <text start="1045.23" dur="5.84">we come back to the question of optics</text>
  <text start="1048.22" dur="5.59">everyone was jumping on Chris Rea and</text>
  <text start="1051.07" dur="5.89">calling him a deep state traitor because</text>
  <text start="1053.81" dur="7.41">he would not publicly in front of</text>
  <text start="1056.96" dur="8.54">Congress say that he believes spying</text>
  <text start="1061.22" dur="5.94">occurred Chris Rea basically said I</text>
  <text start="1065.5" dur="4.3">wouldn&amp;#39;t call it that</text>
  <text start="1067.16" dur="5.01">I would call it surveillance and people</text>
  <text start="1069.8" dur="3.9">lost their minds because bar because</text>
  <text start="1072.17" dur="4.01">Chris Rea would not tell</text>
  <text start="1073.7" dur="4.71">a bunch of his enemies in Congress that</text>
  <text start="1076.18" dur="4.63">spying occurred he would not back up</text>
  <text start="1078.41" dur="5.28">Chris bar all right</text>
  <text start="1080.81" dur="5.85">if you do not understand optics you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1083.69" dur="5.07">gonna be lost in all of this this is all</text>
  <text start="1086.66" dur="4.8">a game of optics</text>
  <text start="1088.76" dur="5.1">you cannot come just just think about</text>
  <text start="1091.46" dur="6.63">this if you were the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="1093.86" dur="7.62">and you ask Barr do you think treason</text>
  <text start="1098.09" dur="6.45">occurred and Barr said you know what I</text>
  <text start="1101.48" dur="5.22">think Comey and mccabe and struck and</text>
  <text start="1104.54" dur="5.85">pager all guilty of treason I can&amp;#39;t wait</text>
  <text start="1106.7" dur="6.33">to see him executed what would America</text>
  <text start="1110.39" dur="3.98">say if their Attorney General heard him</text>
  <text start="1113.03" dur="5.07">say that</text>
  <text start="1114.37" dur="6.58">what would the press say if Barr told</text>
  <text start="1118.1" dur="4.14">everybody I think they committed treason</text>
  <text start="1120.95" dur="4.77">and I think they&amp;#39;re gonna be executed</text>
  <text start="1122.24" dur="6.66">now now that&amp;#39;s what a lot of people want</text>
  <text start="1125.72" dur="6.36">to hear but the Attorney General of the</text>
  <text start="1128.9" dur="6">United States cannot do that he can&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="1132.08" dur="5.28">out publicly and say even if he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1134.9" dur="4.77">thinking it even if he has seen the</text>
  <text start="1137.36" dur="4.77">evidence even if he knows that these</text>
  <text start="1139.67" dur="5.85">people are could be tried for treason</text>
  <text start="1142.13" dur="5.7">he can&amp;#39;t say that publicly all right for</text>
  <text start="1145.52" dur="4.2">the same reason Chris Ray could not say</text>
  <text start="1147.83" dur="4.32">publicly all the things that people</text>
  <text start="1149.72" dur="5.4">wanted him to say because optics are</text>
  <text start="1152.15" dur="4.59">huge you can&amp;#39;t go and just blow this</text>
  <text start="1155.12" dur="4.29">whole thing up you have to wait for it</text>
  <text start="1156.74" dur="5.1">to roll out now Trump can talk about</text>
  <text start="1159.41" dur="4.59">treason all he wants because Trump is</text>
  <text start="1161.84" dur="5.01">not an attorney Trump is not a</text>
  <text start="1164" dur="3.18">prosecutor Trump is a president all</text>
  <text start="1166.85" dur="3.24">right</text>
  <text start="1167.18" dur="4.74">Trump can say whatever he wants if Barr</text>
  <text start="1170.09" dur="5.37">says the word treason people are going</text>
  <text start="1171.92" dur="4.83">to say wait a minute we have to go to 18</text>
  <text start="1175.46" dur="4.05">USC and we have to look up the</text>
  <text start="1176.75" dur="4.08">definition of treason and say and see</text>
  <text start="1179.51" dur="5.67">what is he talking about</text>
  <text start="1180.83" dur="5.04">and frankly look a lot of these we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1185.18" dur="2.13">know what these people are gonna be</text>
  <text start="1185.87" dur="4.08">charged with ultimately we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1187.31" dur="4.76">and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter they will avouch</text>
  <text start="1189.95" dur="3.57">what they&amp;#39;ll figure out whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1192.07" dur="5.11">conspiracy to overthrow the government</text>
  <text start="1193.52" dur="5.46">sedition treason it is not for us to</text>
  <text start="1197.18" dur="3.69">decide and it&amp;#39;s not actually for bar to</text>
  <text start="1198.98" dur="3.72">decide it&amp;#39;s up for the US attorneys who</text>
  <text start="1200.87" dur="4.83">are prosecuting these cases except for</text>
  <text start="1202.7" dur="5.31">them to them to decide what the actual</text>
  <text start="1205.7" dur="5.88">charges will be</text>
  <text start="1208.01" dur="5.9">the media is trying to eight-bar into</text>
  <text start="1211.58" dur="6.96">saying something that they can use to</text>
  <text start="1213.91" dur="7.54">further disqualify him because the media</text>
  <text start="1218.54" dur="5.55">wants to paint bar as a partisan hack</text>
  <text start="1221.45" dur="5.4">they&amp;#39;ve already accused bar of being the</text>
  <text start="1224.09" dur="4.65">president&amp;#39;s personal attorney not the</text>
  <text start="1226.85" dur="4.47">Attorney General and they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1228.74" dur="6.35">get more information they can use</text>
  <text start="1231.32" dur="6.21">against bar to paint him as a partisan</text>
  <text start="1235.09" dur="3.91">person who is only going to work for</text>

  <text start="1239" dur="3.809">fair and right in the best interest of</text>
  <text start="1240.98" dur="4.43">country all right it was a setup</text>
  <text start="1242.809" dur="9.511">question and bar handled it perfectly</text>
  <text start="1245.41" dur="7.93">all right so I&amp;#39;m just kind of going</text>
  <text start="1252.32" dur="5.91">through in some of these comments from</text>
  <text start="1253.34" dur="8.24">Barr he found it very interesting that</text>
  <text start="1258.23" dur="5.67">the media had very little interest in</text>
  <text start="1261.58" dur="4.719">looking into the origin of this</text>
  <text start="1263.9" dur="7.019">investigation after Muller&amp;#39;s report</text>
  <text start="1266.299" dur="6.63">showed no collusion he&amp;#39;s like look if if</text>
  <text start="1270.919" dur="4.591">special counsels report shows no</text>
  <text start="1272.929" dur="4.201">collusion then you have to wonder what</text>

  <text start="1279.919" dur="10.591">it just doesn&amp;#39;t add up right Crawford</text>
  <text start="1288.62" dur="4.559">the interviewer also asked Barr</text>
  <text start="1290.51" dur="4.32">did you discuss declassification with</text>

  <text start="3449.39" dur="4.2">positions as in head of an Intelligence</text>
  <text start="3451.01" dur="4.86">Agency that he did not absolutely trust</text>
  <text start="3453.59" dur="4.05">and if he found out that they were doing</text>
  <text start="3455.87" dur="2.76">something wrong he would get rid of them</text>
  <text start="3457.64" dur="4.02">like that</text>
  <text start="3458.63" dur="5.94">I don&amp;#39;t think Trump would hesitate to</text>

  <text start="3464.57" dur="4.76">that they were going to be a problem</text>
  <text start="3466.24" dur="5.65">Trump knows how important all of this is</text>
  <text start="3469.33" dur="4.45">he knows he has to have people that he</text>

  <text start="3489.63" dur="3.48">not going to put somebody in there and</text>
  <text start="3491.19" dur="4.53">let them stay there if they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="3493.11" dur="5.49">hurt him or hurt woody is his agenda so</text>
  <text start="3495.72" dur="5.46">I think I this is my position I believe</text>
  <text start="3498.6" dur="4.98">we should just trust Trump&amp;#39;s judgment</text>
  <text start="3501.18" dur="6.69">and believe that he&amp;#39;s gonna do what is</text>
