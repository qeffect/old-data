  <text start="188.42" dur="5.61">probably knew that before he went into</text>
  <text start="189.68" dur="6.39">office actually he hinted at their plans</text>
  <text start="194.03" dur="6.78">to impeach him this is a tweet from</text>

  <text start="211.31" dur="5.88">would first head over to the US Supreme</text>
  <text start="213.32" dur="8.22">Court q you posted a link to the</text>
  <text start="217.19" dur="7.24">president&amp;#39;s tweet and then posted a link</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="6.88">to an article on the National Review</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="6.119">which talks about the possibility of</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="5.58">having impeachment reviewed by the</text>

  <text start="454.589" dur="4.23">a lot of speculation of what could</text>
  <text start="456.659" dur="4.26">happen the Senate could I guess in</text>
  <text start="458.819" dur="3.93">theory hold a trial even without the</text>
  <text start="460.919" dur="4.53">articles of impeachment President Trump</text>
  <text start="462.749" dur="5.611">has been asking for a trial because he</text>

  <text start="479.01" dur="4.14">going to happen q and the president have</text>
  <text start="481.44" dur="4.35">also suggested that this may go to the</text>
  <text start="483.15" dur="4.17">Supreme Court so we&amp;#39;ll have to stay</text>
  <text start="485.79" dur="4.26">tuned and see what happens with that</text>
  <text start="487.32" dur="6.36">Chuck Grassley was not amused with</text>
  <text start="490.05" dur="5.88">Pelosi&amp;#39;s shenanigans why is a Democratic</text>
  <text start="493.68" dur="4.23">House now getting cold feet about moving</text>
  <text start="495.93" dur="4.23">ahead with impeachment trial they want</text>
  <text start="497.91" dur="6.12">to hijack a Senate process and muck up</text>
  <text start="500.16" dur="7.17">the Senate SCOTUS schedule so the Senate</text>
  <text start="504.03" dur="5.4">would need to schedule a trial with the</text>
  <text start="507.33" dur="4.29">Supreme Court because Chief Justice</text>
  <text start="509.43" dur="4.95">Roberts would have to be at the Senate</text>
  <text start="511.62" dur="3.96">to present preside over the Senate</text>
  <text start="514.38" dur="3.15">hearing I know a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="515.58" dur="4.11">concerned about the Chief Justice they</text>
  <text start="517.53" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t trust him he&amp;#39;s compromised all</text>
  <text start="519.69" dur="5.34">this it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter the Chief</text>
  <text start="521.94" dur="5.67">Justice is not going to have any say and</text>
  <text start="525.03" dur="4.56">how this goes down if it goes to the</text>
  <text start="527.61" dur="4.38">Senate for trial it is going to be in</text>
  <text start="529.59" dur="3.6">the hands of the Republican senators I</text>
  <text start="531.99" dur="3.41">don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything to worry</text>
  <text start="533.19" dur="9.87">about as far as the Supreme Court goes</text>
  <text start="535.4" dur="11.29">so q post a link to Grassley tweet and</text>
  <text start="543.06" dur="4.89">grassy did ask our Dems to worried that</text>
  <text start="546.69" dur="3.6">their articles are too weak to move</text>
  <text start="547.95" dur="4.8">forward that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a good possibility</text>
  <text start="550.29" dur="4.77">because there are no actual crimes</text>
  <text start="552.75" dur="4.02">listed in the articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="555.06" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s no bribery there&amp;#39;s no treason</text>

  <text start="636.15" dur="4.38">of pretty intelligent people on there</text>
  <text start="638.55" dur="4.83">were discussing the possibility that if</text>
  <text start="640.53" dur="6.24">that Republicans took over the house in</text>
  <text start="643.38" dur="6.51">2020 and the Senate they could pass a</text>
  <text start="646.77" dur="4.91">resolution to expunge the impeachment of</text>
  <text start="649.89" dur="4.98">President Trump from the record</text>
  <text start="651.68" dur="4.9">therefore we could actually undo an</text>
  <text start="654.87" dur="4.53">impeachment vote or expunge it from the</text>
  <text start="656.58" dur="5.16">record and it could be removing from the</text>
  <text start="659.4" dur="6.12">history books in in a way I guess so</text>
  <text start="661.74" dur="7.56">again I have to see what happens with</text>
  <text start="665.52" dur="6.51">that I don&amp;#39;t know what and the president</text>
  <text start="669.3" dur="4.23">has planned but it&amp;#39;ll be it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="672.03" dur="5.93">interesting for everyone so the anons</text>
