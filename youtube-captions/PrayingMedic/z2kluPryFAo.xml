  <text start="118.479" dur="3.39">were in there Juneau they&amp;#39;re jumping</text>
  <text start="119.89" dur="4.35">like four meters from the rocks into the</text>
  <text start="121.869" dur="3.81">into the choppy surf and then we&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="131.14" dur="3.57">said I&amp;#39;m not gonna surf again</text>
  <text start="132.37" dur="4.23">so maybe it&amp;#39;s something I need to pick</text>
  <text start="134.71" dur="3.84">back up again one day I don&amp;#39;t know you</text>
  <text start="136.6" dur="5.1">know that&amp;#39;s interesting because I lived</text>
  <text start="138.55" dur="5.37">in Washington for about 16 years when my</text>
  <text start="141.7" dur="5.94">kids were growing up and we used to go</text>
  <text start="143.92" dur="5.16">out to the coast a lot of people surf in</text>
  <text start="147.64" dur="2.47">California but there&amp;#39;s actually good</text>
  <text start="149.08" dur="2.89">surfing in</text>
  <text start="150.11" dur="4.11">northern Oregon and a little bit in</text>
  <text start="151.97" dur="5.64">Washington and we used to go out there I</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="5.76">did a lot of body boarding but we had to</text>
  <text start="157.61" dur="5.46">have a wetsuit because the water was</text>
  <text start="159.98" dur="5.25">freezing cold and we would stay in all</text>
  <text start="163.07" dur="5.55">day long and then when my kids got a</text>
  <text start="165.23" dur="6.69">little bit older I I taught them how to</text>
  <text start="168.62" dur="6.09">surf we got a and I had never surfed in</text>
  <text start="171.92" dur="4.56">my life but I had watched enough surfers</text>
  <text start="174.71" dur="4.02">that I was able to teach the kids how to</text>
  <text start="176.48" dur="2.7">get on a longboard they had a good time</text>
  <text start="178.73" dur="2.28">with it</text>
  <text start="179.18" dur="4.23">but you know it&amp;#39;s funny that you</text>
  <text start="181.01" dur="5.58">mentioned the the big wave that came and</text>
  <text start="183.41" dur="8.22">took you under because I don&amp;#39;t write a</text>
  <text start="186.59" dur="6.869">lot of prophetic words like you do but</text>
  <text start="191.63" dur="4.26">one of the main prophetic words that I</text>
  <text start="193.459" dur="4.771">wrote was a word that was actually</text>
  <text start="195.89" dur="4.44">requested by a friend of mine and he</text>
  <text start="198.23" dur="4.71">asked me if I could get some revelation</text>
  <text start="200.33" dur="4.02">about the the big wave that was coming</text>
  <text start="202.94" dur="3.21">people have been having dreams and</text>
  <text start="204.35" dur="4.62">visions about the tsunami the big wave</text>
  <text start="206.15" dur="6.93">coming and and I hadn&amp;#39;t had any dreams</text>
  <text start="208.97" dur="7.019">about that but I went to the beach and</text>
  <text start="213.08" dur="6.689">the kids and I went there and it was</text>
  <text start="215.989" dur="9.301">right during a storm and gosh the waves</text>
  <text start="219.769" dur="9.811">were huge talking 6 7 meters Wow</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="6.03">it was crazy eh yeah and we got there</text>
  <text start="229.58" dur="4.409">and we saw a dead seal laying on the</text>
  <text start="231.32" dur="4.229">beach Wow the beach that we the kids had</text>
  <text start="233.989" dur="3.81">always known had completely changed</text>
  <text start="235.549" dur="5.041">completely shifted there is a large</text>
  <text start="237.799" dur="3.931">amount of sand that ran across in front</text>
  <text start="240.59" dur="3.27">of the beach where we normally would go</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="3.36">in it was raised up about six feet and</text>
  <text start="243.86" dur="3.75">the seal was on top of the amount of</text>
  <text start="245.09" dur="4.14">sand the dead seal was and the</text>
  <text start="247.61" dur="3.599">everything had changed the whole</text>
  <text start="249.23" dur="3.75">landscape the sky everything looked like</text>
  <text start="251.209" dur="5.221">a different place and there were these</text>
  <text start="252.98" dur="5.4">huge waves and the kids the kids were</text>

  <text start="261.38" dur="4.289">not going in there that&amp;#39;s correct</text>
  <text start="263.11" dur="4.63">I grabbed the board put my wetsuit on</text>
  <text start="265.669" dur="5.401">and I went out there and I was out for</text>

  <text start="507.47" dur="4.23">God and and the people wanting to into</text>
  <text start="510.11" dur="3.51">the spiritual gifts or whatever it might</text>

  <text start="556.67" dur="5.28">said go and make disciples so he took a</text>
  <text start="559.79" dur="3.93">bunch of fishermen average people who</text>

  <text start="678.62" dur="4.59">it in the hands of nurses and doctors</text>

  <text start="686.23" dur="7.2">mostly picked up by by Christians who</text>
  <text start="688.57" dur="7.53">did other things and mostly went to</text>
  <text start="693.43" dur="6.51">church and started to put it to use in</text>
  <text start="696.1" dur="5.55">the church setting a few people started</text>
  <text start="699.94" dur="4.14">taking it out into you know healing</text>
  <text start="701.65" dur="4.11">rooms and ministries like that there</text>
  <text start="704.08" dur="5.31">weren&amp;#39;t a whole lot of people that were</text>
  <text start="705.76" dur="7.14">doing it in the workplace but in the</text>
  <text start="709.39" dur="5.43">last year or two I have noticed that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="712.9" dur="4.05">getting more emails and testimonies from</text>
  <text start="714.82" dur="3.63">people who work in nursing homes and who</text>
  <text start="716.95" dur="3.57">work in the intensive care unit or the</text>
  <text start="718.45" dur="4.68">operating room where the ER and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="720.52" dur="4.29">telling me stories of using the things I</text>
  <text start="723.13" dur="4.17">wrote in the book and praying for their</text>
  <text start="724.81" dur="4.08">patients and seeing them healed which is</text>
  <text start="727.3" dur="3.45">what I wanted it from the beginning but</text>
  <text start="728.89" dur="4.28">it was very slow to see that actually</text>
  <text start="730.75" dur="5.42">happen and there is nothing better than</text>
  <text start="733.17" dur="5.92">putting out material for people and</text>
  <text start="736.17" dur="5.41">seeing them understand it and get it and</text>
  <text start="739.09" dur="4.8">start doing it it&amp;#39;s incredible</text>
  <text start="741.58" dur="6.03">no I totally agree and in fact I&amp;#39;ve read</text>
  <text start="743.89" dur="6.06">I&amp;#39;ve read some of your your stuff I am I</text>
  <text start="747.61" dur="4.29">think I&amp;#39;ve been a very slack reader over</text>
  <text start="749.95" dur="4.47">the last maybe three or four years and</text>
  <text start="751.9" dur="6.66">my wife is getting me back into it again</text>
  <text start="754.42" dur="7.38">and um but I actually got your help to</text>
  <text start="758.56" dur="4.98">see in the spirit book and I I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="761.8" dur="3.72">gonna lie on all the way through it but</text>
  <text start="763.54" dur="4.44">I&amp;#39;ve just been really blown away with</text>
  <text start="765.52" dur="4.68">how practical and it practical that book</text>
  <text start="767.98" dur="4.05">is and I&amp;#39;m going well like this is a way</text>
  <text start="770.2" dur="3.21">that people can really grab ahold of</text>
  <text start="772.03" dur="5.4">something that is quite complex like I</text>
  <text start="773.41" dur="7.62">said before and I&amp;#39;m just yeah I&amp;#39;m really</text>
  <text start="777.43" dur="6.66">just seeing how the trend these days is</text>
  <text start="781.03" dur="4.95">that people are rising up with the</text>
  <text start="784.09" dur="4.08">complex mysteries of the gospel and the</text>
  <text start="785.98" dur="4.23">things that the world or maybe the</text>
  <text start="788.17" dur="3.75">church has even made you know these</text>
  <text start="790.21" dur="4.5">topics that are maybe either to be or</text>
  <text start="791.92" dur="4.29">you know out of bounds or just made only</text>
  <text start="794.71" dur="2.97">for the elite and it&amp;#39;s now saying hey</text>
  <text start="796.21" dur="3.18">this is what we&amp;#39;re all meant to operate</text>
  <text start="797.68" dur="5.28">in this is what we all have available to</text>
  <text start="799.39" dur="5.07">us and is presented and and and you know</text>
  <text start="802.96" dur="3.93">handed off to people in a way that they</text>
  <text start="804.46" dur="6.03">can in grab and apply to their lives and</text>
  <text start="806.89" dur="7.58">I&amp;#39;m loving it that&amp;#39;s cool I am glad to</text>
  <text start="810.49" dur="6.6">hear that the book has has blessed you</text>
  <text start="814.47" dur="3.43">that&amp;#39;s obviously that&amp;#39;s my goal</text>
  <text start="817.09" dur="2.61">is</text>
  <text start="817.9" dur="4.47">yeah you know I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna write the</text>
  <text start="819.7" dur="3.99">book but you know I had this dream where</text>
  <text start="822.37" dur="3.75">I was writing a book on seeing in the</text>
  <text start="823.69" dur="5.58">spirit and I had not I had no plans to</text>
  <text start="826.12" dur="5.58">write that book and I thought okay Lord</text>
  <text start="829.27" dur="5.13">if you want me to write it I will the</text>
  <text start="831.7" dur="5.25">reason I wrote the book was I had read</text>
  <text start="834.4" dur="5.16">Michael Van vitamines book how to see in</text>
  <text start="836.95" dur="4.38">the spirit and it was a very good book</text>
  <text start="839.56" dur="3.3">and it was a you know I looked at a lot</text>
  <text start="841.33" dur="3.27">of other books on singing in the spirit</text>
  <text start="842.86" dur="4.11">written by different people</text>
  <text start="844.6" dur="5.1">the thing that irritated me and all of</text>
  <text start="846.97" dur="6.6">them was the all the other writers made</text>
  <text start="849.7" dur="6.96">it seem as if it was a special gift just</text>
  <text start="853.57" dur="5.7">for a few people seers and yeah no it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="856.66" dur="5.28">not anyone can do this I don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="859.27" dur="5.34">special gift I just did some exercises</text>
  <text start="861.94" dur="4.65">day after day and he and gradually my</text>
  <text start="864.61" dur="5.94">spiritual eyesight was open and I</text>
  <text start="866.59" dur="5.4">started seeing visions so my the whole</text>
  <text start="870.55" dur="3.66">reason why I wrote that book was to help</text>
  <text start="871.99" dur="5.49">people understand that anyone can see in</text>
  <text start="874.21" dur="4.83">the spirit it&amp;#39;s not a gift it is it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="877.48" dur="4.56">innate ability that just needs to be</text>
  <text start="879.04" dur="4.83">developed like anything else so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="882.04" dur="3.6">cool and I&amp;#39;m glad that you you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="883.87" dur="2.88">enjoying that book when you get done</text>
  <text start="885.64" dur="18.36">with it you&amp;#39;ll have to get the one I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="904" dur="3.45">treat for you there are some pretty</text>
  <text start="905.5" dur="3.69">crazy experiences in that book but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="907.45" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s very similar to the one on singing</text>
  <text start="909.19" dur="3.78">in the spirit I just kind of you know</text>
  <text start="911.17" dur="3.51">give the biblical basis and then</text>
  <text start="912.97" dur="4.59">methodically can try to walk people</text>
  <text start="914.68" dur="4.2">through here&amp;#39;s some nonsense that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="917.56" dur="3.87">all been taught about this and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="918.88" dur="5.19">the truth and here&amp;#39;s some exercises and</text>

  <text start="1036.1" dur="4.41">and I just said her name and I looked in</text>
  <text start="1038.35" dur="3.9">it was a demon looking back at me and I</text>
  <text start="1040.51" dur="3.689">said you get out of her in the name of</text>
  <text start="1042.25" dur="3.569">Jesus and I just spoke to that thing I</text>
  <text start="1044.199" dur="3.361">spoke to the defense and the different</text>
  <text start="1045.819" dur="3.991">things that were going on I spoke to the</text>
  <text start="1047.56" dur="4.47">situation&amp;#39;s and that thing shrieked at</text>
  <text start="1049.81" dur="3.96">me and it took off and she said the</text>
  <text start="1052.03" dur="5.69">first thing she said when she came she</text>
  <text start="1053.77" dur="3.95">said I knew Nate was praying for me</text>
  <text start="1062.01" dur="5.59">Trippi that really challenged me that</text>
  <text start="1065.23" dur="4.56">really challenged my my thinking but</text>

  <text start="1076.99" dur="4.74">dramatically in fact many times where I</text>
  <text start="1079.81" dur="3.6">was praying for my brother one time I</text>
  <text start="1081.73" dur="3.689">was praying for my brother and I saw him</text>

  <text start="1258.919" dur="5.401">awareness that we do this most of us do</text>
  <text start="1262.399" dur="4.681">this much more often than we realize you</text>
  <text start="1264.32" dur="4.62">just don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t get me back and you</text>
  <text start="1267.08" dur="3.87">don&amp;#39;t realize that your spirit can</text>
  <text start="1268.94" dur="3.69">travel and there&amp;#39;s no restrictions like</text>
  <text start="1270.95" dur="3.99">you said the distance in the spirit</text>
  <text start="1272.63" dur="4.049">sometimes it is for a specific purpose</text>
  <text start="1274.94" dur="3.989">like you went there in the spirit</text>
  <text start="1276.679" dur="5.521">because she had this demon that needed</text>
  <text start="1278.929" dur="5.641">to leave yeah and you could have</text>
  <text start="1282.2" dur="4.8">commanded that thing to leave from where</text>
  <text start="1284.57" dur="3.54">you were but it was for whatever reason</text>
  <text start="1287" dur="4.889">the Holy Spirit wanted you to go there</text>
  <text start="1288.11" dur="5.73">confront her maybe did she ever say that</text>
  <text start="1291.889" dur="3.361">she saw you she said that she knew you</text>
  <text start="1293.84" dur="3.6">were praying but you didn&amp;#39;t say that she</text>
  <text start="1295.25" dur="4.76">liked my presence who saw you there</text>
  <text start="1297.44" dur="6.06">anything like that no not in that</text>
  <text start="1300.01" dur="6.1">instance but I was I was very clear and</text>
  <text start="1303.5" dur="4.559">aware of it because I had never had an</text>
  <text start="1306.11" dur="4.64">experience like that and I was and I</text>
  <text start="1308.059" dur="6.781">just knew where I I&amp;#39;d be I just went</text>
  <text start="1310.75" dur="6.519">somewhere and I don&amp;#39;t say it&amp;#39;s too many</text>
  <text start="1314.84" dur="4.469">people but like you know on social media</text>
  <text start="1317.269" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s been a great exercise tool to be</text>
  <text start="1319.309" dur="3.661">able to develop words of knowledge when</text>
  <text start="1321.409" dur="3.031">you can&amp;#39;t see anybody except their</text>
  <text start="1322.97" dur="3.39">little emoticon which you know sometimes</text>
  <text start="1324.44" dur="3.54">the cat or a line or or you know</text>
  <text start="1326.36" dur="4.22">whatever it might be so you can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="1327.98" dur="5.28">see the person and and most of the time</text>
  <text start="1330.58" dur="5.949">I&amp;#39;ll actually see them in this spirit</text>
  <text start="1333.26" dur="5.31">and I go oh look I just saw you know for</text>
  <text start="1336.529" dur="4.051">a fifth vertebrae or whatever it is is</text>
  <text start="1338.57" dur="3.8">that right and I&amp;#39;m in the spirit I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1340.58" dur="4.709">looking at their back and I can see it</text>
  <text start="1342.37" dur="4.84">you know and they and I don&amp;#39;t say hey I</text>
  <text start="1345.289" dur="5.52">just saw you I just go hey is that what</text>
  <text start="1347.21" dur="5.49">it is but many of the times happens and</text>
  <text start="1350.809" dur="2.131">wow like God you just gave me a word of</text>
  <text start="1352.7" dur="3.21">knowledge</text>
  <text start="1352.94" dur="4.74">by showing me you know you know you know</text>
  <text start="1355.91" dur="3.27">I&amp;#39;m not sure if you would classify that</text>
  <text start="1357.68" dur="3.18">it&amp;#39;s traveling in the spirit but I like</text>
  <text start="1359.18" dur="2.82">I&amp;#39;m seeing them for a moment I&amp;#39;m seeing</text>
  <text start="1360.86" dur="3.17">what is going wrong with your body and</text>
  <text start="1362" dur="4.59">then I&amp;#39;m praying over it you know and so</text>
  <text start="1364.03" dur="5.38">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a great way that God can</text>
  <text start="1366.59" dur="4.44">reveal and show things to you and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1369.41" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s been a great exercise for me to</text>
  <text start="1371.03" dur="4.53">growing in that area I think in a sense</text>
  <text start="1373.64" dur="5.25">it probably is traveling the spirit</text>
  <text start="1375.56" dur="6.39">because what most of us describe as</text>
  <text start="1378.89" dur="4.74">seeing something in a vision all right</text>
  <text start="1381.95" dur="3.93">so you in your mind and you see this</text>
  <text start="1383.63" dur="3.6">image you see their spine you look down</text>
  <text start="1385.88" dur="3.6">and go well it looks like you know the</text>
  <text start="1387.23" dur="4.2">around a fourth or fifth lumbar area and</text>
  <text start="1389.48" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re looking at an image in your mind</text>
  <text start="1391.43" dur="5.22">right so yeah many people would just</text>
  <text start="1394.49" dur="7.32">describe that as a vision or an image</text>
  <text start="1396.65" dur="7.83">but it&amp;#39;s the reality is what if I mean</text>
  <text start="1401.81" dur="5.22">what if your spirit actually traveled to</text>
  <text start="1404.48" dur="4.29">where they were and your spirit was</text>
  <text start="1407.03" dur="5.46">standing in a couple of meters away</text>
  <text start="1408.77" dur="5.64">looking at their back your mind your</text>
  <text start="1412.49" dur="3.93">brain your mind perceives that in your</text>
  <text start="1414.41" dur="3.84">mind as a vision but it&amp;#39;s very likely</text>
  <text start="1416.42" dur="5.79">that your spirit actually traveled there</text>
  <text start="1418.25" dur="6.45">to see it up close and I think many</text>
  <text start="1422.21" dur="4.68">times that is what happens not that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1424.7" dur="4.61">of great consequence but it is</text>
  <text start="1426.89" dur="6.3">interesting on social media yeah that</text>
  <text start="1429.31" dur="5.86">like if you have a an 85 year old woman</text>
  <text start="1433.19" dur="3.27">standing in front of you it&amp;#39;s a bit</text>
  <text start="1435.17" dur="4.35">easier to get a word of knowledge for</text>
  <text start="1436.46" dur="3.92">her maybe then somebody on Facebook that</text>
  <text start="1439.52" dur="3.54">you don&amp;#39;t know what they look like</text>
  <text start="1440.38" dur="4.96">that&amp;#39;s right not easier to get the</text>
  <text start="1443.06" dur="10.2">information but you have a little more</text>
  <text start="1445.34" dur="9.56">boldness yeah that&amp;#39;s right and and I</text>
  <text start="1453.26" dur="5.49">think I think the beauty is that God</text>
  <text start="1454.9" dur="5.68">wants us to be stretched that area you</text>
  <text start="1458.75" dur="3.69">know that&amp;#39;s just talking about the way</text>
  <text start="1460.58" dur="5.46">that we travel in like you know is that</text>
  <text start="1462.44" dur="5.67">my spirit traveling I think it is</text>
  <text start="1466.04" dur="3.69">because I liken it to when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1468.11" dur="4.29">worshiping and what God&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1469.73" dur="4.35">developed in in the area of worship for</text>
  <text start="1472.4" dur="3.51">me like when I&amp;#39;m worshiping I literally</text>
  <text start="1474.08" dur="4.35">go into it into a different realm I like</text>
  <text start="1475.91" dur="4.35">um I feel like I&amp;#39;m really going into a</text>
  <text start="1478.43" dur="3.42">different realm or you know sometimes it</text>
  <text start="1480.26" dur="4.59">just feels like ah this is you have</text>
  <text start="1481.85" dur="4.62">those times before I worship yes well</text>
  <text start="1484.85" dur="3.54">you feel yeah maybe</text>
  <text start="1486.47" dur="3.689">the throne room of heaven before the</text>
  <text start="1488.39" dur="4.44">throne you&amp;#39;re literally feel like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1490.159" dur="4.531">in heaven yeah yes I think that&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1492.83" dur="4.14">common when people are in really deep</text>
  <text start="1494.69" dur="6.21">intimate worship I think the spirit goes</text>
  <text start="1496.97" dur="7.74">into the heavens and is the Lord I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1500.9" dur="6.3">actually heard my voice echo heard my</text>
  <text start="1504.71" dur="3.63">voice echo in the heavens and and I said</text>
  <text start="1507.2" dur="7.56">to the Lord what is that and he said</text>
  <text start="1508.34" dur="10.05">your voice is known here Wow the the the</text>
  <text start="1514.76" dur="5.46">actual the actual you know spiritual I</text>
  <text start="1518.39" dur="5.84">guess activity that is taking place</text>
  <text start="1520.22" dur="6.54">during worship is is so incredible and</text>
  <text start="1524.23" dur="3.699">look I won&amp;#39;t share the story now but</text>
  <text start="1526.76" dur="3.96">there was a there&amp;#39;s this young guy who</text>
  <text start="1527.929" dur="5.61">was in my worship 10 years ago and he</text>
  <text start="1530.72" dur="4.35">was that he was a seer and and not just</text>
  <text start="1533.539" dur="3.12">that he had had many spiritual</text>
  <text start="1535.07" dur="3.93">experiences and he is actually the one</text>
  <text start="1536.659" dur="4.741">who really opened up my eyes to</text>
  <text start="1539" dur="4.409">understanding what was taking place in</text>
  <text start="1541.4" dur="3.42">worship what he would see during worship</text>
  <text start="1543.409" dur="3.181">when we&amp;#39;re worshiping and he would see</text>
  <text start="1544.82" dur="5.37">he would sit he would go up into the</text>
  <text start="1546.59" dur="5.37">into into heaven and he would see me you</text>
  <text start="1550.19" dur="3.66">know I would dressed in a certain thing</text>
  <text start="1551.96" dur="3.449">because I always see you when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1553.85" dur="3.99">worshiping doing this certain activity</text>
  <text start="1555.409" dur="5.971">up in heaven oh wow oh like our spirits</text>

  <text start="1716.21" dur="5.25">ourselves and both of us grown up in the</text>
  <text start="1719.03" dur="4.29">church we didn&amp;#39;t realize God was just</text>
  <text start="1721.46" dur="4.68">saying you know this was going to be a</text>
  <text start="1723.32" dur="5.55">season of dismantling and it began in</text>

  <text start="1728.87" dur="3.84">Bethel Church and we both had the</text>
  <text start="1730.91" dur="5.03">powerful encounter with God and it just</text>
  <text start="1732.71" dur="5.85">it just set something off in us we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1735.94" dur="5.2">all wait till April God was just</text>
  <text start="1738.56" dur="5.97">dismantling some deep stuff in us while</text>

  <text start="1748.82" dur="4.339">stuff and yeah I knew in my spirit I</text>
  <text start="1752.09" dur="3.889">just knew I was</text>

  <text start="1755.979" dur="6.15">us and i came back we had no job to come</text>
  <text start="1759.19" dur="4.679">back to yeah there was just everything</text>
  <text start="1762.129" dur="4.561">was a complete mess we had to begin</text>
  <text start="1763.869" dur="4.77">again and it was like discouragement and</text>
  <text start="1766.69" dur="5.039">disappointment after disappointment for</text>
  <text start="1768.639" dur="7.561">years to be honest with you you and</text>
  <text start="1771.729" dur="6.81">Christie are both pastors kids yeah did</text>
  <text start="1776.2" dur="5.549">you grow up with what would you say that</text>
  <text start="1778.539" dur="5.61">your view of the church and God was a</text>
  <text start="1781.749" dur="5.191">bit distorted from how you view things</text>
  <text start="1784.149" dur="4.35">now oh absolutely and that&amp;#39;s not to</text>
  <text start="1786.94" dur="5.88">discredit our parents but of course</text>
  <text start="1788.499" dur="10.17">right many churches have kind of a not</text>
  <text start="1792.82" dur="7.409">so good view of God yeah so so that was</text>
  <text start="1798.669" dur="3.96">that I&amp;#39;m guessing that was a time when</text>
  <text start="1800.229" dur="5.31">God was kind of reframing the discussion</text>
  <text start="1802.629" dur="4.41">and some of your mindsets and your</text>
  <text start="1805.539" dur="3.2">beliefs and your understanding of how</text>
  <text start="1807.039" dur="4.47">things work maybe</text>
  <text start="1808.739" dur="4.211">absolutely and we we recognize now that</text>
  <text start="1811.509" dur="5.85">had been happening for many years before</text>
  <text start="1812.95" dur="7.38">that I I was blessed to to have a great</text>
  <text start="1817.359" dur="4.8">mentor and he was a revivalist and one</text>
  <text start="1820.33" dur="4.11">of Australia&amp;#39;s you know spiritual</text>
  <text start="1822.159" dur="4.23">fathers and he was speaking a lot into</text>
  <text start="1824.44" dur="6.109">my life and I realized now that was</text>
  <text start="1826.389" dur="7.321">where this this kind of dissatisfaction</text>
  <text start="1830.549" dur="5.171">for the norm kind of set in and it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1833.71" dur="4.169">that he was trying to you know influence</text>
  <text start="1835.72" dur="3.659">me that way but he saw what was in me</text>
  <text start="1837.879" dur="4.081">and he was drawing it out drawing it out</text>
  <text start="1839.379" dur="4.29">and he prophesied that America Caesar</text>
  <text start="1841.96" dur="5.88">would be exactly what it was and it did</text>
  <text start="1843.669" dur="6.75">and we we just had this longing for</text>
  <text start="1847.84" dur="4.98">something that we saw and in that</text>
  <text start="1850.419" dur="4.14">experience that in you know Bethel</text>
  <text start="1852.82" dur="3.659">Church in 2009 I went into this</text>
  <text start="1854.559" dur="4.83">encounter that took place then we</text>
  <text start="1856.479" dur="4.8">explained it is that for two weeks it</text>
  <text start="1859.389" dur="3.96">was like a revelatory window was open</text>
  <text start="1861.279" dur="3.84">and whether I was a sleeper awake I was</text>
  <text start="1863.349" dur="3.39">seeing visions I was I was writing</text>
  <text start="1865.119" dur="3.48">things down constantly and it was all</text>
  <text start="1866.739" dur="4.77">about the Reformation of the church and</text>
  <text start="1868.599" dur="4.28">it was this I was hearing the sounds of</text>
  <text start="1871.509" dur="3">worship that I&amp;#39;d never heard before</text>
  <text start="1872.879" dur="3.581">here&amp;#39;s all these different things</text>
  <text start="1874.509" dur="3.27">actually really challenged me it really</text>
  <text start="1876.46" dur="4.679">confronted a lot of things that I</text>
  <text start="1877.779" dur="4.801">thought church was and it was it was</text>
  <text start="1881.139" dur="2.88">really difficult because I knew God was</text>
  <text start="1882.58" dur="3.88">giving it to me but I didn&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="1884.019" dur="5.201">I was like this is rebellious this is</text>
  <text start="1886.46" dur="5.34">you know this is not acceptable kind of</text>
  <text start="1889.22" dur="6.42">thing you know this is crazy because</text>
  <text start="1891.8" dur="7.01">yeah thousand in 2008 I went through the</text>
  <text start="1895.64" dur="7.56">same thing I had been in kind of an</text>
  <text start="1898.81" dur="7">institutional church for seven years</text>
  <text start="1903.2" dur="4.86">and in 2008 the Lord began to speak to</text>
  <text start="1905.81" dur="4.23">me first time ever prophetically I</text>
  <text start="1908.06" dur="4.53">started to hear his voice really clearly</text>
  <text start="1910.04" dur="4.92">and it was all about Reformation and</text>
  <text start="1912.59" dur="4.56">change and I&amp;#39;m doing a new thing and old</text>
  <text start="1914.96" dur="6.33">models of the church are being torn down</text>
  <text start="1917.15" dur="6.21">and all of this change and change and</text>
  <text start="1921.29" dur="5.31">Reformation I was like what are you</text>
  <text start="1923.36" dur="5.43">doing am I&amp;#39;m losing my mind and now and</text>
  <text start="1926.6" dur="3.87">now six or seven years later I mean</text>
  <text start="1928.79" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re running into all these people who</text>
  <text start="1930.47" dur="5.28">had round the same time got the same</text>
  <text start="1932.27" dur="5.13">word same message exactly yeah you know</text>

  <text start="1937.4" dur="4.59">well I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m going against the flow here</text>
  <text start="1940.22" dur="3.45">and you know what really we are there is</text>
  <text start="1941.99" dur="4.17">still and against the flow feeling but</text>

  <text start="1946.16" dur="3.87">been through that now then but almost</text>
  <text start="1947.9" dur="4.29">the the people that they were opposing</text>
  <text start="1950.03" dur="4.92">it and it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1952.19" dur="5.01">crazy how much God has brought it&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1957.2" dur="3.63">change to to the church but more than</text>
  <text start="1959.27" dur="4.05">that just to the hearts of people like</text>

  <text start="1972.35" dur="3.96">uh it&amp;#39;s so much easier working with the</text>
  <text start="1974.57" dur="5.64">flow of people and against I can tell</text>
  <text start="1976.31" dur="6.3">you and yeah hey mate I have another</text>
  <text start="1980.21" dur="7.73">question for you sure what can you tell</text>
  <text start="1982.61" dur="7.77">us about the fragment collector yes</text>
  <text start="1987.94" dur="4.99">sounds like a word that I did it is a</text>
  <text start="1990.38" dur="4.8">prophetic word that you did I think it</text>
  <text start="1992.93" dur="4.95">was actually the first prophetic word</text>
  <text start="1995.18" dur="5.03">that I read that you wrote about it was</text>
  <text start="1997.88" dur="6.27">emotional healing</text>
  <text start="2000.21" dur="5.92">and I was like oh my gosh no one ever</text>
  <text start="2004.15" dur="3.51">writes prophetic words about emotional</text>
  <text start="2006.13" dur="4.23">healing that&amp;#39;s what made it jump off the</text>
  <text start="2007.66" dur="4.65">page because you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="2010.36" dur="4.65">prophetic words they&amp;#39;re kind of generic</text>
  <text start="2012.31" dur="5.91">in their approach to a particular</text>
  <text start="2015.01" dur="4.98">situation and this word that you wrote</text>
  <text start="2018.22" dur="2.85">the fragment collector</text>
  <text start="2019.99" dur="3.03">grabbed it and they shared it on my</text>
  <text start="2021.07" dur="3.39">Facebook page I thought it was so good</text>
  <text start="2023.02" dur="3.99">do you remember it</text>
  <text start="2024.46" dur="4.14">I kind of do now that you&amp;#39;re mentioning</text>
  <text start="2027.01" dur="3.75">and I I mean I know it&amp;#39;s a very personal</text>
  <text start="2028.6" dur="4.47">kind of word I think it was like about</text>
  <text start="2030.76" dur="3.45">my own experience I think and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2033.07" dur="3.48">actually something I&amp;#39;ve written a lot</text>
  <text start="2034.21" dur="4.469">more on not with the fragment collector</text>
  <text start="2036.55" dur="4.95">tied a little bit just about my own</text>
  <text start="2038.679" dur="5.88">healing and everything like that and how</text>
  <text start="2041.5" dur="5.16">God took a big scattered mess of a kid</text>
  <text start="2044.559" dur="4.35">who&amp;#39;d grown up in a broken home and</text>
  <text start="2046.66" dur="3.78">everything and you know there was just a</text>
  <text start="2048.909" dur="3.151">lot of feel like a lot of fragments to</text>
  <text start="2050.44" dur="2.91">my life that he had to pull together and</text>
  <text start="2052.06" dur="3.78">I didn&amp;#39;t really think he could do it to</text>
  <text start="2053.35" dur="4.26">be honest and I you know what this is</text>
  <text start="2055.84" dur="3.39">something we minister to we teach on we</text>
  <text start="2057.61" dur="3.99">have we have bondage break of course on</text>
  <text start="2059.23" dur="4.949">but it&amp;#39;s strange how it comes in waves</text>
  <text start="2061.6" dur="4.289">and I feel like even where I&amp;#39;m at now</text>
  <text start="2064.179" dur="3.031">there&amp;#39;s still times where God will just</text>
  <text start="2065.889" dur="2.671">bring me into this place was like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2067.21" dur="3.209">like oh there&amp;#39;s another little fragment</text>
  <text start="2068.56" dur="3.54">I&amp;#39;m pulling that in right now and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2070.419" dur="3.781">like oh come on</text>
  <text start="2072.1" dur="4.62">kind of just be done you know but yeah</text>
  <text start="2074.2" dur="4.08">look I currently remember a little bit</text>
  <text start="2076.72" dur="4.23">what was it talking about you remember I</text>
  <text start="2078.28" dur="4.31">was using that as a segue to get into a</text>
  <text start="2080.95" dur="4.29">discussion about emotional healing</text>
  <text start="2082.59" dur="4.45">actually and that is interested in the</text>
  <text start="2085.24" dur="3.24">word as I am in the process that you</text>
  <text start="2087.04" dur="2.46">went through they say you want to know</text>
  <text start="2088.48" dur="3.689">about that Prout you want to know about</text>
  <text start="2089.5" dur="4.619">that process I would because most of my</text>
  <text start="2092.169" dur="3.391">listeners know a little bit about my</text>
  <text start="2094.119" dur="4.201">process of going through emotional</text>
  <text start="2095.56" dur="5.85">healing and it has it has been a process</text>
  <text start="2098.32" dur="4.68">it like it is for most people you get a</text>
  <text start="2101.41" dur="3.99">little here and a little there and then</text>
  <text start="2103" dur="4.23">yeah I&amp;#39;m aware that wow I still have</text>
  <text start="2105.4" dur="5.55">some wood in this today it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2107.23" dur="5.58">bugging me yeah I need to get through a</text>
  <text start="2110.95" dur="5.58">little more so what was what was your</text>
  <text start="2112.81" dur="6.51">process like well I guess some for me it</text>
  <text start="2116.53" dur="5.64">all began with I did I had to forgive my</text>
  <text start="2119.32" dur="6.02">stepfather I in my teens I was just a</text>
  <text start="2122.17" dur="5.43">big fragmented mess to be honest and I</text>
  <text start="2125.34" dur="7.21">came back to the Lord maybe when I was</text>
  <text start="2127.6" dur="6.15">about 18 19 and 19 and we started</text>
  <text start="2132.55" dur="5.13">running a youth group and I was still a</text>
  <text start="2133.75" dur="6.45">big mess they probably turned into an</text>
  <text start="2137.68" dur="4.47">even bigger mess it was a huge mess and</text>
  <text start="2140.2" dur="3.78">the beginning of that year the Lord said</text>
  <text start="2142.15" dur="4.98">to me wanted me to forgive my stepdad</text>
  <text start="2143.98" dur="4.86">and I will share this because this is</text>
  <text start="2147.13" dur="4.65">probably the crux of where it all began</text>
  <text start="2148.84" dur="4.779">and so I had to forgive my step</text>
  <text start="2151.78" dur="3.85">stepfather for you know there was a mo</text>
  <text start="2153.619" dur="4.98">abuse physical abuse and stuff like that</text>
  <text start="2155.63" dur="4.379">and I hadn&amp;#39;t seen him in a long time and</text>
  <text start="2158.599" dur="3.781">the Lord said to me</text>
  <text start="2160.009" dur="4.681">you know this year there&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>

  <text start="2343.01" dur="6.9">vision can you praying and I was I was</text>
  <text start="2345.59" dur="6.96">completely set free of the of all those</text>
  <text start="2349.91" dur="4.23">feelings and there&amp;#39;s so much emotional</text>
  <text start="2352.55" dur="3.36">healing that took place in that day but</text>
  <text start="2354.14" dur="4.08">I do have to say that there&amp;#39;s just been</text>
  <text start="2355.91" dur="4.98">a process in other areas but the</text>
  <text start="2358.22" dur="5.28">absolute monstrosity and weight of what</text>
  <text start="2360.89" dur="4.68">I went through as a boy who you know who</text>
  <text start="2363.5" dur="4.05">had a father that left her the father</text>
  <text start="2365.57" dur="4.74">was never there and then a stepfather</text>
  <text start="2367.55" dur="4.68">who who never treated him like a son and</text>
  <text start="2370.31" dur="3.99">all that kind of stuff and the different</text>
  <text start="2372.23" dur="3.72">things that went with that that I would</text>
  <text start="2374.3" dur="3.57">have to say like most of that just got</text>
  <text start="2375.95" dur="3.12">sucked up in that one moment and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2377.87" dur="2.88">say that to make people go oh well</text>
  <text start="2379.07" dur="3.42">that&amp;#39;s great for you Nate because you</text>
  <text start="2380.75" dur="3.63">know this has taken me years I want to</text>
  <text start="2382.49" dur="4.44">tell you something I was 20 I was 21 or</text>
  <text start="2384.38" dur="4.44">22 and that experience took place and I</text>
  <text start="2386.93" dur="3.66">still didn&amp;#39;t know my father I still</text>
  <text start="2388.82" dur="3.93">didn&amp;#39;t know father God and I spent all</text>
  <text start="2390.59" dur="3.84">these years searching out spiritual</text>
  <text start="2392.75" dur="3.87">figures to be my father and got burned</text>
  <text start="2394.43" dur="4.05">and got burned and got hurt and got hurt</text>
  <text start="2396.62" dur="3.48">looking for somebody that I could look</text>
  <text start="2398.48" dur="4.02">up to and somebody who would approve of</text>
  <text start="2400.1" dur="4.29">me I was such an approval addict I was</text>
  <text start="2402.5" dur="3.42">just looking for that person there was</text>
  <text start="2404.39" dur="3">still emotional things that needed to</text>
  <text start="2405.92" dur="3.33">take place and so when I wrote that</text>
  <text start="2407.39" dur="4.26">fragment collector word I was still</text>
  <text start="2409.25" dur="3.69">talking about a present place that I was</text>
  <text start="2411.65" dur="3.27">in that God was collecting these</text>
  <text start="2412.94" dur="4.56">fragments in my life and and and</text>
  <text start="2414.92" dur="4.56">restoring me and that&amp;#39;s just my story</text>
  <text start="2417.5" dur="3.87">and I feel like that I don&amp;#39;t think that</text>
  <text start="2419.48" dur="4.23">will end I feel like that the Lord is</text>
  <text start="2421.37" dur="4.44">just he&amp;#39;s restoring us we&amp;#39;re renewed you</text>
  <text start="2423.71" dur="3.87">know like it&amp;#39;s a daily process just by</text>
  <text start="2425.81" dur="4.38">being with him and connected with him</text>
  <text start="2427.58" dur="4.68">and that&amp;#39;s just something that that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2430.19" dur="3.96">reality of emotional healing is that it</text>
  <text start="2432.26" dur="4.74">can be a journey the closer we get to</text>
  <text start="2434.15" dur="5.67">the Lord and you know I don&amp;#39;t that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2437" dur="6.75">just my story with that oh gosh</text>
  <text start="2439.82" dur="6.08">it was such an amazing story my my</text>
  <text start="2443.75" dur="4.23">observations about emotional healing is</text>
  <text start="2445.9" dur="3.82">all right you have to if you almost</text>
  <text start="2447.98" dur="6.62">think about yourself as like a soldier</text>
  <text start="2449.72" dur="8.4">in a war from the time you crawl out of</text>
  <text start="2454.6" dur="5.89">the baby crib into the world you are</text>
  <text start="2458.12" dur="8.7">you&amp;#39;re essentially sort of a soldier in</text>
  <text start="2460.49" dur="8.37">a war and you took a serious injury when</text>
  <text start="2466.82" dur="4.05">you were four years old you know you</text>
  <text start="2468.86" dur="5.49">crawled up on a mine and the mind went</text>
  <text start="2470.87" dur="5.91">off and you got blown up pretty bad it</text>
  <text start="2474.35" dur="4.86">didn&amp;#39;t kill you but it did a lot of</text>
  <text start="2476.78" dur="3.09">damage and then yeah when you were six</text>
  <text start="2479.21" dur="3.69">years old</text>
  <text start="2479.87" dur="6">you had another incident with you know</text>
  <text start="2482.9" dur="4.56">your stepfather and six weeks later</text>
  <text start="2485.87" dur="5.36">another incident and another incident</text>
  <text start="2487.46" dur="6.18">another incident now you&amp;#39;re an adult and</text>
  <text start="2491.23" dur="5.53">you are getting healed of the past</text>
  <text start="2493.64" dur="6.51">traumas but for most of us we get on</text>
  <text start="2496.76" dur="7.5">social media and somebody says something</text>
  <text start="2500.15" dur="7.11">rude insensitive hurtful whatever I mean</text>
  <text start="2504.26" dur="5.1">I go on my blog and I sees you know two</text>
  <text start="2507.26" dur="7.02">or three comments that people left me</text>
  <text start="2509.36" dur="8.6">yeah what a phony I am and yeah and you</text>
  <text start="2514.28" dur="6.03">get those more emotional trauma right or</text>
  <text start="2517.96" dur="4.27">you go out to dinner with your wife and</text>
  <text start="2520.31" dur="4.08">somebody at a restaurant is rude to you</text>
  <text start="2522.23" dur="4.01">or rude to her or whatever I mean we all</text>
  <text start="2524.39" dur="4.92">go through life and we develop more</text>
  <text start="2526.24" dur="7.12">emotional trauma more wounds more hurt</text>
  <text start="2529.31" dur="8.09">or rejection more pain well that doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2533.36" dur="8.4">all get healed at one time that is the</text>
  <text start="2537.4" dur="6.28">injuries come sequentially in a process</text>
  <text start="2541.76" dur="4.41">and I was robbing the healing comes</text>
  <text start="2543.68" dur="4.23">sequentially and I and I tell people</text>
  <text start="2546.17" dur="4.35">every like you know what you should do</text>
  <text start="2547.91" dur="3.84">is every day at the end of the day when</text>
  <text start="2550.52" dur="2.73">you&amp;#39;re getting ready to go to bed just</text>
  <text start="2551.75" dur="3.42">think back about the day and think back</text>
  <text start="2553.25" dur="4.05">about the hurtful painful</text>
  <text start="2555.17" dur="4.89">things people have said to you things</text>
  <text start="2557.3" dur="4.91">that they&amp;#39;ve done to you think about the</text>
  <text start="2560.06" dur="5.25">emotional trauma that you suffered and</text>
  <text start="2562.21" dur="5.62">to give the pain to Jesus before you go</text>
  <text start="2565.31" dur="4.5">to bed yeah but it&amp;#39;s really really good</text>
  <text start="2567.83" dur="3.72">you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s kinda the same</text>
  <text start="2569.81" dur="4.14">thing that God is really showing us we</text>
  <text start="2571.55" dur="4.62">we teach on soul healing and everything</text>
  <text start="2573.95" dur="4.23">like that and it&amp;#39;s been incredible</text>
  <text start="2576.17" dur="3.75">the things that God&amp;#39;s done through it</text>
  <text start="2578.18" dur="4.02">and there was this one church service in</text>
  <text start="2579.92" dur="4.35">particular that God was showing me</text>
  <text start="2582.2" dur="3.18">specific things to go after and it was</text>
  <text start="2584.27" dur="3.87">just like things were flying other</text>
  <text start="2585.38" dur="4.59">people it was incredible I where I wish</text>
  <text start="2588.14" dur="3.6">that happened for me that quick but it</text>
  <text start="2589.97" dur="3.42">really does come down to like stop</text>
  <text start="2591.74" dur="3.42">taking what&amp;#39;s going into your soul</text>
  <text start="2593.39" dur="3.72">what&amp;#39;s going out and the Lord showed me</text>
  <text start="2595.16" dur="4.11">a filing cabinet years ago and he said</text>
  <text start="2597.11" dur="3.81">to me you know I was in a very boring</text>
  <text start="2599.27" dur="4.65">government job at the time and I was</text>
  <text start="2600.92" dur="4.65">they put me on filing Judy this one week</text>
  <text start="2603.92" dur="4.65">when they got behind went wow that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2605.57" dur="4.83">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s fun and I remember filing</text>
  <text start="2608.57" dur="3.33">for days and the Lord just said to me</text>
  <text start="2610.4" dur="3.45">you know this is what your soul looks</text>
  <text start="2611.9" dur="6.93">like it&amp;#39;s a filing compactus you know</text>
  <text start="2613.85" dur="6.45">and and it&amp;#39;s like realizing where every</text>
  <text start="2618.83" dur="4.41">day there are deposits that have been</text>
  <text start="2620.3" dur="5.91">made into our soul and I&amp;#39;m like wow like</text>
  <text start="2623.24" dur="6.63">I can&amp;#39;t allow things to fester in there</text>
  <text start="2626.21" dur="4.92">anymore I can&amp;#39;t allow you know even if</text>
  <text start="2629.87" dur="3">there are things that going I need to</text>
  <text start="2631.13" dur="3.12">address it I need to go home I need to I</text>
  <text start="2632.87" dur="4.89">need to be free of that thing you know</text>
  <text start="2634.25" dur="5.58">and um if we let things fester in there</text>
  <text start="2637.76" dur="3.78">too long they can become areas that the</text>
  <text start="2639.83" dur="4.44">enemy can use they can be strongholds</text>
  <text start="2641.54" dur="4.89">for the enemy and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2644.27" dur="4.56">something which I&amp;#39;ve definitely</text>
  <text start="2646.43" dur="4.95">experienced in my life and I can see in</text>
  <text start="2648.83" dur="4.2">my families you know a history of our</text>
  <text start="2651.38" dur="5.01">family that&amp;#39;s best being a big deal</text>
  <text start="2653.03" dur="5.25">where people have have had a lot of soul</text>
  <text start="2656.39" dur="4.65">issues that have needed to be healing</text>
  <text start="2658.28" dur="4.02">and uh so I definitely agree with you</text>
  <text start="2661.04" dur="3.24">it&amp;#39;s just about addressing it at the end</text>
  <text start="2662.3" dur="5.19">of the day saying hey Lord this place</text>
  <text start="2664.28" dur="6.66">here you know I give that to you today</text>
  <text start="2667.49" dur="5.88">that&amp;#39;s yours you know and in fact you</text>
  <text start="2670.94" dur="4.71">know the whole the whole kind of placing</text>
  <text start="2673.37" dur="3.96">things placing wood upon the altar it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2675.65" dur="3.39">like that I&amp;#39;m taking these things I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2677.33" dur="3.42">placing it out on the altar for you burn</text>
  <text start="2679.04" dur="5.43">it go for it you know like this is yours</text>
  <text start="2680.75" dur="5.88">this is this is I give you my soul as</text>
  <text start="2684.47" dur="3.24">well as stop not just my spirit that I</text>
  <text start="2686.63" dur="2.16">want to give you I want to give you my</text>
  <text start="2687.71" dur="2.97">soul</text>
  <text start="2688.79" dur="3.18">and so it&amp;#39;s this place of relationship</text>
  <text start="2690.68" dur="3.21">with the law that we get to surrender</text>
  <text start="2691.97" dur="4.05">the things in us that are hurting us or</text>
  <text start="2693.89" dur="4.83">the things that have affected us and</text>
  <text start="2696.02" dur="6.27">it&amp;#39;s worship yeah that&amp;#39;s the interesting</text>
  <text start="2698.72" dur="5.76">thing about soul healing is it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2702.29" dur="4.71">something that God will do unless you</text>
  <text start="2704.48" dur="5.67">give him permission to do it yeah you</text>
  <text start="2707" dur="5.16">have to give up your right to be</text>
  <text start="2710.15" dur="5.67">offended you have to give up your right</text>
  <text start="2712.16" dur="6.69">to be angry you have to give the Lord</text>
  <text start="2715.82" dur="4.44">permission to take it because as long as</text>
  <text start="2718.85" dur="6.18">you want to hold on to it he will let</text>
  <text start="2720.26" dur="7.5">you hold on to it yeah that&amp;#39;s it oh so</text>
  <text start="2725.03" dur="5.4">good it&amp;#39;s a big topic no it&amp;#39;s a huge</text>
  <text start="2727.76" dur="5.58">topic I I wrote a short book on</text>
  <text start="2730.43" dur="5.88">emotional healing but I&amp;#39;m in the process</text>
  <text start="2733.34" dur="5.34">of writing a longer one a full-length</text>
  <text start="2736.31" dur="4.53">book on emotional healing and</text>
  <text start="2738.68" dur="5.25">deliverance mostly just using</text>
  <text start="2740.84" dur="6.03">testimonies that I&amp;#39;ve gotten from people</text>
  <text start="2743.93" dur="5.87">over the years and looking at specific</text>
  <text start="2746.87" dur="8.15">conditions like bipolar and depression</text>
  <text start="2749.8" dur="7.54">and the PTSD and and explaining how each</text>
  <text start="2755.02" dur="4.3">condition sort of how it affects your</text>
  <text start="2757.34" dur="4.14">soul in your mind and you know</text>
  <text start="2759.32" dur="3.84">successful processes that people have</text>
  <text start="2761.48" dur="3.21">used techniques and steps that they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2763.16" dur="3.03">used to get healed that stuff that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2764.69" dur="4.14">looking forward to writing that book</text>
  <text start="2766.19" dur="4.2">that&amp;#39;ll that&amp;#39;ll be a lot of fun because</text>
  <text start="2768.83" dur="2.76">when I whenever I sit down to write a</text>
  <text start="2770.39" dur="4.17">book the Lord gives me a lot more</text>
  <text start="2771.59" dur="6.18">revelation like I will have these</text>
  <text start="2774.56" dur="5.82">testimonies that I know of and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2777.77" dur="4.77">kind of scattered and when I sit down to</text>
  <text start="2780.38" dur="4.32">write a book the Lord just lines them up</text>
  <text start="2782.54" dur="4.71">and then gives me more revelation about</text>
  <text start="2784.7" dur="4.44">why this happened here and how this</text>
  <text start="2787.25" dur="5.19">connected to that and puts all the</text>
  <text start="2789.14" dur="4.29">pieces together it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s pretty cool</text>
  <text start="2792.44" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons why I like</text>
  <text start="2793.43" dur="6.03">writing is when I&amp;#39;m writing the Holy</text>
  <text start="2795.74" dur="5.46">Spirit connects the dots for me it</text>
  <text start="2799.46" dur="3.39">definitely shows that your revelation</text>
  <text start="2801.2" dur="4.74">flows is just like soon as you put that</text>
  <text start="2802.85" dur="5.22">that pen down it kind of run roles and</text>
  <text start="2805.94" dur="5.1">unravels them well I&amp;#39;m a prophetic</text>
  <text start="2808.07" dur="5.97">writer like you and Jesse Berkey and a</text>
  <text start="2811.04" dur="7.05">lot of my friends are prophetic speakers</text>
  <text start="2814.04" dur="7.59">as soon as you start to speak the Holy</text>
  <text start="2818.09" dur="4.68">Spirit comes upon your words and starts</text>
  <text start="2821.63" dur="3.93">to inspire your words well</text>
  <text start="2822.77" dur="6.45">happens to me sometimes but it happens</text>
  <text start="2825.56" dur="6.06">much more when I write yeah I sit down</text>
  <text start="2829.22" dur="4.26">and I get quiet and I just kind of</text>
  <text start="2831.62" dur="5.12">listen tune into what the Holy Spirit is</text>
  <text start="2833.48" dur="5.43">saying and tried to dictate that yeah</text>
  <text start="2836.74" dur="4.6">Kristi&amp;#39;s actually the same as you she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2838.91" dur="4.65">is she very much yeah she&amp;#39;s a writer she</text>
  <text start="2841.34" dur="4.08">just is something that takes place when</text>
  <text start="2843.56" dur="3.75">she&amp;#39;s riding it just flows whereas when</text>
  <text start="2845.42" dur="7.8">she when she speaks she won&amp;#39;t have that</text>
  <text start="2847.31" dur="8.91">same confidence yeah yeah I think it</text>
  <text start="2853.22" dur="4.8">might be an area that she feels like her</text>
  <text start="2856.22" dur="4.5">writing is just carries such prophetic</text>
  <text start="2858.02" dur="3.84">weight that whereas I&amp;#39;m my words</text>
  <text start="2860.72" dur="3.72">actually come from something that I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2861.86" dur="4.68">spoken a lot of times I&amp;#39;ll yeah that my</text>
  <text start="2864.44" dur="3.66">voice memo and just start just start</text>
  <text start="2866.54" dur="3.45">recording what and just come under that</text>
  <text start="2868.1" dur="3.36">you know that prophetic utterance will</text>
  <text start="2869.99" dur="3.18">flow and then I&amp;#39;ll listen back later and</text>
  <text start="2871.46" dur="5.07">write a word and that&amp;#39;s how it will</text>
  <text start="2873.17" dur="4.53">happen um you know and everyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2876.53" dur="3.27">different like that I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2877.7" dur="3.75">incredible but I can see with yours I</text>
  <text start="2879.8" dur="3.66">can see the bubbling forth in your words</text>
  <text start="2881.45" dur="4.65">it&amp;#39;s incredible to see that in your</text>
  <text start="2883.46" dur="5.96">words but it&amp;#39;s so evident yeah thanks</text>
  <text start="2886.1" dur="6.15">so do you have a lot of dreams I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2889.42" dur="5.32">incredible I mean you know what Christie</text>
  <text start="2892.25" dur="4.29">has probably twice as much streams as me</text>
  <text start="2894.74" dur="5.1">and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a bit of a joke in</text>
  <text start="2896.54" dur="6.15">the house that you know that I&amp;#39;m in the</text>
  <text start="2899.84" dur="4.32">pocket and you know all in all interpret</text>
  <text start="2902.69" dur="3.18">because you know she has more dreams in</text>
  <text start="2904.16" dur="4.05">you then you can then you can poke a</text>
  <text start="2905.87" dur="4.68">stick out its its nightly where every</text>
  <text start="2908.21" dur="3.54">morning there first it feels like our</text>
  <text start="2910.55" dur="4.38">first ever dream</text>
  <text start="2911.75" dur="4.83">Judy other pain okay pull the dream out</text>
  <text start="2914.93" dur="4.59">what you know we&amp;#39;re sitting in we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2916.58" dur="6.3">playing a rabbit it&amp;#39;s incredible we</text>
  <text start="2919.52" dur="6.57">we&amp;#39;ve both been heavy dreamers their</text>
  <text start="2922.88" dur="4.59">whole lives and even Christie&amp;#39;s pizza</text>
  <text start="2926.09" dur="3.87">dreams that les used to call have been</text>
  <text start="2927.47" dur="4.32">so highly prophetic that we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="2929.96" dur="3.27">well there&amp;#39;s something in that and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2931.79" dur="3.6">been a renewable something a gradually</text>
  <text start="2933.23" dur="3.98">developed in us over the years and you</text>
  <text start="2935.39" dur="5.46">know help interpret dreams for people</text>
  <text start="2937.21" dur="5.83">you know probably 60% of my words come</text>
  <text start="2940.85" dur="5.25">from a dream yeah most of my prophetic</text>
  <text start="2943.04" dur="5.13">revelation comes from dreams yes some of</text>
  <text start="2946.1" dur="4.38">it doesn&amp;#39;t some of it I&amp;#39;ll get inspired</text>
  <text start="2948.17" dur="4.86">when I&amp;#39;m awake but I have the most</text>
  <text start="2950.48" dur="4.98">confidence writing yeah medically from</text>
  <text start="2953.03" dur="3.72">the things that I see in dreams that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2955.46" dur="3.3">funny because my wife</text>
  <text start="2956.75" dur="4.83">has more dreams than I do to Denis</text>
  <text start="2958.76" dur="4.89">dreams every night and she&amp;#39;ll have two</text>
  <text start="2961.58" dur="3.96">or three dreams a night but she doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2963.65" dur="4.14">remember them very well</text>
  <text start="2965.54" dur="4.53">I will remember most of my dreams and</text>
  <text start="2967.79" dur="3.63">write them down she has a lot of dreams</text>
  <text start="2970.07" dur="3.75">so it doesn&amp;#39;t remember them as well but</text>
  <text start="2971.42" dur="4.95">I give her a pass on that because she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2973.82" dur="9.45">taking a lunesta which kind of knocks</text>
  <text start="2976.37" dur="9.21">her out yeah yeah yeah but when she does</text>
  <text start="2983.27" dur="5.28">remember a dream they&amp;#39;re usually pretty</text>
  <text start="2985.58" dur="6.69">good so my question about the dreams is</text>
  <text start="2988.55" dur="7.35">do you know of anything that people can</text>
  <text start="2992.27" dur="5.16">do who want to have more dreams and I</text>
  <text start="2995.9" dur="3.27">have friends who ask me something from</text>
  <text start="2997.43" dur="3.33">time to time you know I don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="2999.17" dur="4.2">dreams is there anything that I can do</text>
  <text start="3000.76" dur="4.94">to increase or to start having dreams is</text>
  <text start="3003.37" dur="5.07">there anything that you&amp;#39;ve run across</text>
  <text start="3005.7" dur="5.8">you know what it&amp;#39;s something that has</text>
  <text start="3008.44" dur="6.18">happened I didn&amp;#39;t expect it it was</text>
  <text start="3011.5" dur="5.64">probably bad April last year it seemed</text>
  <text start="3014.62" dur="4.05">to be quite a theme for a few months</text>
  <text start="3017.14" dur="3.87">there where the law was speaking to me</text>
  <text start="3018.67" dur="4.74">about dreams and he said to me I want</text>
  <text start="3021.01" dur="6.3">you to stir up a hunger in my people to</text>
  <text start="3023.41" dur="7.65">dream you know okay are you provoking</text>
  <text start="3027.31" dur="5.64">them to jealousy it was not like I was</text>
  <text start="3031.06" dur="3.21">just like because you know what actually</text>
  <text start="3032.95" dur="3.12">at the time I wasn&amp;#39;t really having that</text>
  <text start="3034.27" dur="2.97">many dreams myself was more saying</text>
  <text start="3036.07" dur="2.91">something out of obedience so there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3037.24" dur="3.93">more like a god I&amp;#39;d like I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="3038.98" dur="4.44">have more dreams you know and then I you</text>
  <text start="3041.17" dur="3.33">know I quickly went back on that said</text>
  <text start="3043.42" dur="5.88">don&amp;#39;t give me any more dreams I want to</text>
  <text start="3044.5" dur="6.36">sleep at night you know there is nothing</text>
  <text start="3049.3" dur="4.41">better than waking up at two o&amp;#39;clock in</text>
  <text start="3050.86" dur="16.83">the morning from a dream and no go back</text>
  <text start="3053.71" dur="15.36">to sleep when you have a really profound</text>
  <text start="3067.69" dur="3">dream in the middle of the night the</text>
  <text start="3069.07" dur="4.08">only reason I can&amp;#39;t get back to sleep is</text>
  <text start="3070.69" dur="4.95">I start processing and I&amp;#39;m things like</text>
  <text start="3073.15" dur="5.58">interpreting what does this mean I saw</text>
  <text start="3075.64" dur="5.31">Donald Trump okay I saw this boy what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3078.73" dur="4.08">happening what are we talking about here</text>
  <text start="3080.95" dur="4.59">and I can&amp;#39;t go back to sleep my mind is</text>
  <text start="3082.81" dur="4.14">just racing exactly right and actually</text>
  <text start="3085.54" dur="4.11">I&amp;#39;ll give you a really cool story and</text>
  <text start="3086.95" dur="3.72">actually involves ways I cooperates your</text>
  <text start="3089.65" dur="4.53">first thing</text>
  <text start="3090.67" dur="5.64">yes so in that same maybe month and a</text>
  <text start="3094.18" dur="3.9">half period when I was I was praying for</text>
  <text start="3096.31" dur="4.92">doing some people so many people started</text>
  <text start="3098.08" dur="5.16">dreaming I said to them simply just</text>
  <text start="3101.23" dur="5.04">simply ask simply ask for dreams you</text>
  <text start="3103.24" dur="4.71">know I I kind of see it that you know</text>
  <text start="3106.27" dur="3.57">Joel too says in the last days apart my</text>
  <text start="3107.95" dur="3.36">spirit on all flesh and it says that</text>
  <text start="3109.84" dur="3.18">we&amp;#39;re gonna dream right and that&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="3111.31" dur="4.35">everybody so I&amp;#39;m like well if that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3113.02" dur="4.8">available why don&amp;#39;t we just ask in for</text>
  <text start="3115.66" dur="4.35">it to take place and and I just said you</text>
  <text start="3117.82" dur="4.32">know simply ask for the dreams you know</text>
  <text start="3120.01" dur="4.2">Lord if there&amp;#39;s any areas that have</text>
  <text start="3122.14" dur="4.02">blocked us to be anything that stopped</text>
  <text start="3124.21" dur="3.99">us from being able to dream are they or</text>
  <text start="3126.16" dur="3.81">any is there any fear there we had</text>
  <text start="3128.2" dur="3.93">nightmare nightmare as in the past that</text>
  <text start="3129.97" dur="4.08">have stopped us from from dreaming or</text>
  <text start="3132.13" dur="4.11">whatever else we just block that right</text>
  <text start="3134.05" dur="4.23">now we just and we thank you Lord that</text>
  <text start="3136.24" dur="4.53">the end that you know the dreams are a</text>
  <text start="3138.28" dur="5.46">normal part of you communicating to us</text>
  <text start="3140.77" dur="5.3">and so we take back that area in fact</text>
  <text start="3143.74" dur="4.86">you know I shared that this only what</text>
  <text start="3146.07" dur="4.66">last night I released us about dreams</text>
  <text start="3148.6" dur="3.72">and God claiming back the night seasons</text>
  <text start="3150.73" dur="3.72">again so this is very relevant again for</text>
  <text start="3152.32" dur="3.84">this season I believe this is a real</text>
  <text start="3154.45" dur="3.33">season where there&amp;#39;s a lot of strategies</text>
  <text start="3156.16" dur="3.21">and blueprints from heaven that are</text>
  <text start="3157.78" dur="4.38">being released to people there&amp;#39;s I had</text>
  <text start="3159.37" dur="4.47">an I had a very specific dream last week</text>
  <text start="3162.16" dur="2.97">which was I was in the second heavens</text>
  <text start="3163.84" dur="2.97">and that&amp;#39;s a whole other story because</text>
  <text start="3165.13" dur="4.95">that was the Freak history in my life</text>
  <text start="3166.81" dur="7.74">but yeah so I had people last year after</text>
  <text start="3170.08" dur="6.33">I prayed for them five people all within</text>
  <text start="3174.55" dur="4.89">the space of a week wrote to me and said</text>
  <text start="3176.41" dur="4.92">hey Nate I had this dream of you and I</text>
  <text start="3179.44" dur="3.45">standing in front of a huge wave and</text>

  <text start="3182.89" dur="5.07">people tell me rant about the same thing</text>
  <text start="3185.35" dur="4.95">like what you know what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going</text>

  <text start="3227.44" dur="3.48">then he said this thing over me he goes</text>
  <text start="3229.119" dur="6.301">the same thing will start happening for</text>
  <text start="3230.92" dur="8.369">you so I mean he imparted that anointing</text>
  <text start="3235.42" dur="6.449">to you that&amp;#39;s kind to me and it was a</text>
  <text start="3239.289" dur="4.53">month later I was like felt stirred to</text>
  <text start="3241.869" dur="4.051">start praying this over people and</text>
  <text start="3243.819" dur="3.51">people started dream and people started</text>
  <text start="3245.92" dur="3.78">having these dreams of me and this wave</text>
  <text start="3247.329" dur="4.831">and what is in this any year and you</text>
  <text start="3249.7" dur="4.829">know like nine months later I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="3252.16" dur="4.08">very I still don&amp;#39;t understand the ins</text>
  <text start="3254.529" dur="3.33">and outs of why God would do that but I</text>
  <text start="3256.24" dur="3.839">do know something is that there was</text>
  <text start="3257.859" dur="4.321">things birth and things imparted and</text>
  <text start="3260.079" dur="3.421">things created in the spirit and those</text>
  <text start="3262.18" dur="3.419">people are connected to God in those</text>
  <text start="3263.5" dur="3.569">seasons and getting that previously were</text>
  <text start="3265.599" dur="2.91">robbed of their night seasons and I</text>
  <text start="3267.069" dur="2.641">believe that I believe dreams should be</text>
  <text start="3268.509" dur="2.971">a powerful time especially for</text>
  <text start="3269.71" dur="4.68">intercessors and prophetic people you</text>
  <text start="3271.48" dur="4.589">know who it was so highly revelatory we</text>
  <text start="3274.39" dur="3.209">need to be connected in the night and</text>
  <text start="3276.069" dur="3.361">the enemy has really come against that</text>
  <text start="3277.599" dur="3.51">place he&amp;#39;s really tried to poison that</text>
  <text start="3279.43" dur="3.689">place for a lot of people in fear</text>
  <text start="3281.109" dur="3.781">because he knows if he can stop that an</text>
  <text start="3283.119" dur="3.45">area if he can stop conception in the</text>
  <text start="3284.89" dur="3.179">night seasons then he&amp;#39;s gonna stop the</text>
  <text start="3286.569" dur="3.75">revelation that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s meant to flow</text>
  <text start="3288.069" dur="3.601">and the blueprints and the strategies</text>
  <text start="3290.319" dur="2.881">and the things from heaven he&amp;#39;s wanting</text>
  <text start="3291.67" dur="2.909">to release the new things he&amp;#39;s wanting</text>
  <text start="3293.2" dur="3.99">to release from art from heaven to earth</text>
  <text start="3294.579" dur="4.411">you know so yeah dreams are important</text>
  <text start="3297.19" dur="3.81">and I think we need to know more about</text>
  <text start="3298.99" dur="4.049">that I feel like that&amp;#39;s an area that</text>
  <text start="3301" dur="3.859">we&amp;#39;re developing in them in the kingdom</text>
  <text start="3303.039" dur="4.26">and we have some great people like</text>
  <text start="3304.859" dur="4.24">yourself that are really going well this</text>
  <text start="3307.299" dur="4.351">is important let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s do this you</text>
  <text start="3309.099" dur="7.17">know it is important I was reading a</text>
  <text start="3311.65" dur="7.82">word from Lenovo sir last night about</text>
  <text start="3316.269" dur="6.211">dreams this is this is a season I think</text>

  <text start="4084.96" dur="4.53">could just go on there and get a</text>
  <text start="4085.95" dur="6.78">prophetic word and it went on for gosh</text>
  <text start="4089.49" dur="4.859">probably a year year and a half people</text>

  <text start="4118.62" dur="4.05">hear the Lord&amp;#39;s voice and to give a</text>
  <text start="4120.33" dur="5.4">prophetic word but the people who were</text>
