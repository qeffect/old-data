  <text start="183.1" dur="5.04">video explaining the memo the fisa memo</text>
  <text start="186.79" dur="4.29">from the House Intelligence Committee I</text>
  <text start="188.14" dur="5.28">will do a broadcast on that so but first</text>
  <text start="191.08" dur="6.24">I probably need to get Mike my cue</text>
  <text start="193.42" dur="6.99">broadcast up-to-date so what I&amp;#39;ll try to</text>
  <text start="197.32" dur="6.06">do tomorrow morning is I&amp;#39;ll do a thread</text>
  <text start="200.41" dur="5.52">on Twitter putting all the q posts I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="203.38" dur="4.199">do a video of that I&amp;#39;ll get some time</text>
  <text start="205.93" dur="4.17">aside whenever the memo comes out I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="207.579" dur="5.061">look at the memo and see if I can break</text>
  <text start="210.1" dur="7.35">that down steal some ideas from</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="7.39">conservative tree house and then do a</text>
  <text start="217.45" dur="7.65">video on the FISA memo</text>
  <text start="220.03" dur="8.64">and let me say this and this is in the</text>
  <text start="225.1" dur="7.13">title of the of the message there is</text>
  <text start="228.67" dur="12.569">probably going to be more than one memo</text>
  <text start="232.23" dur="12.67">and it that comes from Monica Crowley</text>
  <text start="241.239" dur="7.681">who was on Fox today and she said this</text>
  <text start="244.9" dur="6.869">is the first of many memos as bad as</text>
  <text start="248.92" dur="5.52">this memo maybe my understanding from my</text>
  <text start="251.769" dur="5.72">sources is there are worse ones coming</text>
  <text start="254.44" dur="6.21">down the pike not worse in the sense of</text>
  <text start="257.489" dur="6.941">bad for the country worse in the sense</text>
  <text start="260.65" dur="5.58">of the implications for people who are</text>
  <text start="264.43" dur="5.37">corrupt are going to be work</text>
  <text start="266.23" dur="9.57">and let me tell you what I think that</text>
  <text start="269.8" dur="7.41">might be about all right so the memo let</text>
  <text start="275.8" dur="5.19">me tell you the status on the memo first</text>
  <text start="277.21" dur="6.95">so the the House Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="280.99" dur="6.48">FISA abuse memo went to the White House</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="6.55">resident looked at it he is going to he</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="7.68">has Declassified it and he has requested</text>
  <text start="290.71" dur="7.17">no redactions which means all of the</text>
  <text start="295.15" dur="6.78">names of all the people the dates and</text>
  <text start="297.88" dur="6">all that is is going to be left in there</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="3.6">whereas it goes back to the House</text>
  <text start="303.88" dur="2.76">Intelligence Committee so it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="305.53" dur="3.51">back to the House Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="306.64" dur="5.97">it&amp;#39;s probably back there already</text>
  <text start="309.04" dur="7.5">the house is expected to release the</text>
  <text start="312.61" dur="6.48">memo tomorrow and it is up to them if</text>
  <text start="316.54" dur="4.08">they want to redact any names</text>
  <text start="319.09" dur="4.13">now the FBI and the Department of</text>
  <text start="320.62" dur="6.09">Justice have been begging and pleading</text>
  <text start="323.22" dur="4.9">to if you&amp;#39;re gonna at least your you</text>
  <text start="326.71" dur="3.93">know release the memo at least redact</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="6.57">some of the names but the president has</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="5.31">requested no redactions so I think</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="2.46">tomorrow we&amp;#39;re going to get an</text>
  <text start="335.95" dur="3.03">unredacted memo</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="5.16">I think the names will be in there in</text>
  <text start="338.98" dur="7.82">the memo and we will know who the people</text>
  <text start="342.31" dur="7.62">are and what they did and look Kazuko</text>

  <text start="355.51" dur="6.21">have all the names in it and we can go</text>
  <text start="359.35" dur="4.92">from we we kind of suspect a lot of a</text>
  <text start="361.72" dur="6.72">suspect what is in there we know that</text>
  <text start="364.27" dur="8.28">the FBI abused the NSA database that</text>
  <text start="368.44" dur="6.69">they illegally spied on people for</text>
  <text start="372.55" dur="4.17">political purposes that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the one</text>
  <text start="375.13" dur="3.32">thing we know that is gonna be in that</text>
  <text start="376.72" dur="5.91">memo there will be other things probably</text>
