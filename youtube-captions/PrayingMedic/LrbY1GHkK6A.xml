  <text start="19.45" dur="4.89">subject that is a growing interest to a</text>
  <text start="21.79" dur="4.29">lot of people the subject is seeing in</text>
  <text start="24.34" dur="4.83">the spirit and traveling in the spirit</text>
  <text start="26.08" dur="6.089">and how we do it every week I receive at</text>
  <text start="29.17" dur="5.1">least 10 or 12 questions from people who</text>
  <text start="32.169" dur="4.261">are trying to see in the spirit trying</text>
  <text start="34.27" dur="2.969">to travel in spirit trying to go into</text>
  <text start="36.43" dur="3.92">the courtrooms</text>
  <text start="37.239" dur="6.181">of heaven and they have difficulty</text>
  <text start="40.35" dur="5.32">experiencing and seeing what is going on</text>
  <text start="43.42" dur="5.25">when they do this so they write to me</text>
  <text start="45.67" dur="4.59">and say hey pragmatic I&amp;#39;m not having any</text>
  <text start="48.67" dur="3.029">luck with this it just isn&amp;#39;t happening</text>
  <text start="50.26" dur="4.34">what am I doing wrong</text>
  <text start="51.699" dur="5.551">what am I looking for so I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="54.6" dur="5.65">explain a little bit today about the</text>
  <text start="57.25" dur="5.85">process involved with that as most of</text>
  <text start="60.25" dur="6.69">you know I was an atheist until I was 38</text>
  <text start="63.1" dur="7.35">years old and even at that point I had</text>
  <text start="66.94" dur="5.73">not had a dream for 25 years I did not</text>
  <text start="70.45" dur="4.8">see visions I didn&amp;#39;t really see anything</text>
  <text start="72.67" dur="5.61">in the spiritual world I&amp;#39;ve never been</text>
  <text start="75.25" dur="7.59">what some people would call a seer it</text>
  <text start="78.28" dur="8.04">wasn&amp;#39;t until 2007 or 2008 when I started</text>
  <text start="82.84" dur="5.669">to become interested in seeing visions</text>
  <text start="86.32" dur="3.899">and singing in the spirit and that was</text>
  <text start="88.509" dur="3.6">actually the time when the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="90.219" dur="3.061">began to give me visions in the middle</text>
  <text start="92.109" dur="3.87">of the night I had a lot of night</text>
  <text start="93.28" dur="5.28">visions that visions are an interesting</text>
  <text start="95.979" dur="5.1">phenomenon night visions are something</text>
  <text start="98.56" dur="4.14">like dreams but night visions happen</text>
  <text start="101.079" dur="3.57">when you&amp;#39;re awake it&amp;#39;s almost like</text>
  <text start="102.7" dur="4.019">having a dream while you&amp;#39;re awake and</text>
  <text start="104.649" dur="4.621">you see these images in your mind night</text>
  <text start="106.719" dur="4.68">visions are generally revelation that</text>
  <text start="109.27" dur="4.8">the Lord gives you sovereignly</text>
  <text start="111.399" dur="5.46">but you can also see in the spiritual</text>
  <text start="114.07" dur="4.77">world without the Holy Spirit being</text>
  <text start="116.859" dur="3.54">directly involved you can do it of your</text>
  <text start="118.84" dur="4.68">own volition it&amp;#39;s actually very simple</text>
  <text start="120.399" dur="5.46">although it does take time and practice</text>
  <text start="123.52" dur="5.64">for some people to develop their</text>
  <text start="125.859" dur="5.21">spiritual vision in the same way that a</text>
  <text start="129.16" dur="4.32">normal human when they&amp;#39;re born has</text>
  <text start="131.069" dur="5.321">physical eyes they&amp;#39;re able to see the</text>
  <text start="133.48" dur="5.91">same way we have the sense of smell the</text>
  <text start="136.39" dur="6.09">sense of touch the sense of taste all of</text>
  <text start="139.39" dur="5.31">these physical senses that we have we</text>
  <text start="142.48" dur="4.319">have a corresponding spiritual sense</text>
  <text start="144.7" dur="4.67">that goes with it so you can smell</text>
  <text start="146.799" dur="4.25">things in the spiritual world you can</text>
  <text start="149.37" dur="3.839">these things in the spiritual world you</text>
  <text start="151.049" dur="5.22">can taste things in the spiritual world</text>
  <text start="153.209" dur="5.941">you can sense feelings and emotions in</text>
  <text start="156.269" dur="5.521">the spiritual world all the same senses</text>
  <text start="159.15" dur="5.13">that we have with our physical body our</text>
  <text start="161.79" dur="4.8">spiritual body has the same senses</text>
  <text start="164.28" dur="4.679">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people out there who</text>
  <text start="166.59" dur="4.92">believe that you have to have a gift to</text>
  <text start="168.959" dur="4.771">be able to see in the spirit that you</text>
  <text start="171.51" dur="4.14">need special anointing to see in the</text>
  <text start="173.73" dur="4.17">spirit it&amp;#39;s very common in the</text>
  <text start="175.65" dur="4.29">charismatic and Pentecostal church to</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="5.07">hear people talk about this person is a</text>
  <text start="179.94" dur="5.34">seer and that person is not a seer as if</text>
  <text start="182.97" dur="4.409">one person is able to see in the spirit</text>
  <text start="185.28" dur="3.45">and the other person isn&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="187.379" dur="6.11">believe that that&amp;#39;s actually true I</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="7.86">think the term seer is greatly misused I</text>
  <text start="193.489" dur="4.691">don&amp;#39;t like using it myself because I</text>
  <text start="196.59" dur="4.11">don&amp;#39;t think there are special people who</text>
  <text start="198.18" dur="4.529">are given a gift of seeing in the spirit</text>
  <text start="200.7" dur="3.709">that other people don&amp;#39;t have you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="202.709" dur="4.321">find it anywhere in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="204.409" dur="5.08">mention that there is a gift of thing in</text>
  <text start="207.03" dur="4.799">the spirit now there is a gift of</text>
  <text start="209.489" dur="5.761">discerning of spirits but how you</text>
  <text start="211.829" dur="5.641">discern the presence of spirits you can</text>
  <text start="215.25" dur="5.819">use all of the spiritual senses you can</text>
  <text start="217.47" dur="5.79">use smell sight taste touch so there</text>
  <text start="221.069" dur="4.741">isn&amp;#39;t really a gift of thing in the</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="4.17">spirit although I will continue to get</text>
  <text start="225.81" dur="4.109">emails and messages from people who will</text>
  <text start="227.43" dur="4.169">say oh you&amp;#39;re so gifted and your ability</text>
  <text start="229.919" dur="3.301">to see in the spirit and I just want to</text>
  <text start="231.599" dur="4.681">cringe and say well no I&amp;#39;m really not</text>
  <text start="233.22" dur="5.909">when a baby is born they have an ability</text>
  <text start="236.28" dur="6.12">to see with their physical eyes but what</text>
  <text start="239.129" dur="5.911">they perceive in their mind is this</text>
  <text start="242.4" dur="5.19">blurry image they can&amp;#39;t focus on</text>
  <text start="245.04" dur="5.94">anything that&amp;#39;s in the distance they</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="5.91">have to over time develop their ability</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="4.89">to see with their physical eyes they</text>
  <text start="253.5" dur="4.769">have to exercise their eyes they have to</text>
  <text start="255.87" dur="4.44">learn how to focus the images that come</text>
  <text start="258.269" dur="4.141">through their eyes onto the retina that</text>
  <text start="260.31" dur="4.02">are projected to the optic nerve and</text>
  <text start="262.41" dur="3.78">into the brain it&amp;#39;s a process that</text>
  <text start="264.33" dur="4.83">children have to go through to learn how</text>
  <text start="266.19" dur="5.759">to use their physical eyes properly and</text>
  <text start="269.16" dur="5.039">the same thing is true with learning how</text>
  <text start="271.949" dur="5.881">to use your spiritual eyes some people</text>
  <text start="274.199" dur="6.21">are born with a more advanced developed</text>
  <text start="277.83" dur="4.53">ability to see in the spirit Blake Healy</text>
  <text start="280.409" dur="3.211">has a great book called the veil he</text>
  <text start="282.36" dur="3.45">writes about</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="4.47">his experiences as a child seeing demons</text>
  <text start="285.81" dur="5.37">and angels and all kinds of spiritual</text>
  <text start="288.09" dur="5.91">creatures Blake is a guy who was born</text>
  <text start="291.18" dur="5.16">with a very advanced ability to see in</text>
  <text start="294" dur="4.56">the spirit but he doesn&amp;#39;t have a gift or</text>
  <text start="296.34" dur="4.77">ability that you or I don&amp;#39;t have he just</text>
  <text start="298.56" dur="4.98">had the same ability the rest of us have</text>
  <text start="301.11" dur="6.44">it was just more fully developed when he</text>
  <text start="303.54" dur="8.01">was born but anyone can develop the same</text>
  <text start="307.55" dur="6.22">acuity the same ability to see demons</text>
  <text start="311.55" dur="4.05">and angels that Blake Healy has or that</text>
  <text start="313.77" dur="5.33">I have or that Michael van blamin has</text>
  <text start="315.6" dur="6.75">it&amp;#39;s really a matter of practice and</text>
  <text start="319.1" dur="4.99">persistence and exercise now I have</text>
  <text start="322.35" dur="4.23">friends who have contacted me and they</text>
  <text start="324.09" dur="4.47">said I&amp;#39;ve tried these exercises I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="326.58" dur="3.809">tried this it tried that and I still</text>
  <text start="328.56" dur="4.139">can&amp;#39;t say anything I&amp;#39;ve actually had</text>
  <text start="330.389" dur="4.021">some people tell me that they have some</text>
  <text start="332.699" dur="4.351">type of a neurological disorder or</text>
  <text start="334.41" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;ve had a head injury and they</text>
  <text start="337.05" dur="6.48">insist they can are not able to see in</text>
  <text start="340.77" dur="4.56">the spirit because of it well you are</text>
  <text start="343.53" dur="4.23">more than welcome to believe that if you</text>
  <text start="345.33" dur="4.5">want to I don&amp;#39;t believe that&amp;#39;s true and</text>
  <text start="347.76" dur="4.65">here&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t believe that sure I</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="4.8">believe everyone can see in the spirit</text>
  <text start="352.41" dur="4.41">regardless of whatever physical</text>
  <text start="354.63" dur="4.349">limitations they have and and here&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="356.82" dur="4.92">these very same people who tell me that</text>
  <text start="358.979" dur="4.171">they can&amp;#39;t see in the spirit I ask them</text>
  <text start="361.74" dur="4.38">well can you see with your physical eyes</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="4.5">and they say oh yeah I can see fine I</text>
  <text start="366.12" dur="3.18">just can&amp;#39;t see anything I never have</text>
  <text start="367.65" dur="3.389">dreams I never have visions when it</text>
  <text start="369.3" dur="3.36">closed my eyes everything&amp;#39;s always black</text>
  <text start="371.039" dur="3.241">I just don&amp;#39;t have the ability to see</text>
  <text start="372.66" dur="3.84">anything other than what&amp;#39;s in the</text>
  <text start="374.28" dur="5.609">physical world so we have to talk a</text>
  <text start="376.5" dur="5.88">little bit about how the mind is able to</text>
  <text start="379.889" dur="4.231">perceive that things we see in the</text>
  <text start="382.38" dur="3.509">physical world and then we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="384.12" dur="4.59">compare that with how the mind perceives</text>
  <text start="385.889" dur="5.4">things in the spiritual world when you</text>
  <text start="388.71" dur="4.53">have your eyes open and you see</text>
  <text start="391.289" dur="4.671">something in the physical world what</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="6.12">you&amp;#39;re seeing is an arrangement of</text>
  <text start="395.96" dur="6.37">photons of light those photons of light</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="4.95">are picked up and transmitted through</text>
  <text start="402.33" dur="5.25">the lens and the cornea in your eyes</text>
  <text start="404.31" dur="5.729">they are projected onto the retina at</text>
  <text start="407.58" dur="5.67">the back of your eyeball and the image</text>
  <text start="410.039" dur="5.981">is actually flipped upside down once the</text>
  <text start="413.25" dur="4.84">image appears on your retina</text>
  <text start="416.02" dur="4.5">is transmitted to the optic nerve and</text>
  <text start="418.09" dur="5.07">the optic nerve transmits it to the</text>
  <text start="420.52" dur="5.25">brain as a series of electrical impulses</text>
  <text start="423.16" dur="5.249">it&amp;#39;s no longer an actual image it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="6.6">series of electrical impulses and your</text>
  <text start="428.409" dur="7.29">brain has to now reconstruct the photons</text>
  <text start="432.37" dur="6.12">of light and the electronic signals into</text>
  <text start="435.699" dur="4.5">an image that makes sense that is what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.49" dur="4.769">going on when you are seeing something</text>
  <text start="440.199" dur="7.47">in the physical world now how does your</text>
  <text start="443.259" dur="5.851">brain reconstruct those images so that</text>
  <text start="447.669" dur="3.661">it makes sense</text>
  <text start="449.11" dur="7.589">well it takes the electronic signals and</text>
  <text start="451.33" dur="8.16">it really imagines them on a little</text>
  <text start="456.699" dur="6.271">projection screen in your mind that is</text>
  <text start="459.49" dur="6.09">called your imagination now when I say</text>
  <text start="462.97" dur="5.37">the word imagination a lot of people</text>
  <text start="465.58" dur="4.29">think no wait a minute the imagination</text>
  <text start="468.34" dur="4.379">is where we make things up in our mind</text>
  <text start="469.87" dur="4.799">well that&amp;#39;s true the imagination is the</text>
  <text start="472.719" dur="4.861">little TV screen in your mind that</text>
  <text start="474.669" dur="6.06">allows you to invent and create things</text>
  <text start="477.58" dur="5.78">out of your own soul but it is also the</text>
  <text start="480.729" dur="5.37">apparatus that your brain uses to</text>
  <text start="483.36" dur="4.63">reconstruct images of things in the</text>
  <text start="486.099" dur="5.671">physical world that your body needs to</text>
  <text start="487.99" dur="6.06">see now if you are able to see things in</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="4.29">the physical world then that little TV</text>
  <text start="494.05" dur="4.859">screen in your mind where these images</text>
  <text start="496.06" dur="5.19">are projected the things that we see in</text>
  <text start="498.909" dur="5.341">the spiritual world are projected on the</text>
  <text start="501.25" dur="6.12">same screen you have the same apparatus</text>
  <text start="504.25" dur="6.06">when we see something in the spiritual</text>
  <text start="507.37" dur="7.77">world whether it is an angel or a demon</text>
  <text start="510.31" dur="7.71">or Jesus when we see a spiritual object</text>
  <text start="515.14" dur="6.209">of spiritual landscape of spiritual</text>
  <text start="518.02" dur="5.399">scene we are seeing it with our spirit</text>
  <text start="521.349" dur="3.961">with the eyes of our spirit what the</text>
  <text start="523.419" dur="4.141">Bible sometimes call the eyes of our</text>
  <text start="525.31" dur="4.89">heart the eyes of our inner man so we</text>
  <text start="527.56" dur="5.04">have a physical set of eyes and we have</text>
  <text start="530.2" dur="5.55">a spiritual set of eyes both of them</text>
  <text start="532.6" dur="6.239">work everybody who was ever born was</text>
  <text start="535.75" dur="5.79">born with a spirit that has a spiritual</text>
  <text start="538.839" dur="6.331">set of eyes that can see interestingly</text>
  <text start="541.54" dur="6.15">enough I watched a youtube video which</text>
  <text start="545.17" dur="4.24">was a testimony of a woman who was born</text>
  <text start="547.69" dur="3.519">blind from birth she didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="549.41" dur="3.45">ever been able to see anything she had a</text>
  <text start="551.209" dur="3.541">near-death experience and in a</text>
  <text start="552.86" dur="5.539">near-death experience for the first time</text>
  <text start="554.75" dur="6.42">in her life she was able to see images</text>
  <text start="558.399" dur="3.101">see people and see things and it freaked</text>
  <text start="561.17" dur="2.82">her out</text>
  <text start="561.5" dur="4.889">now she came back from the near-death</text>
  <text start="563.99" dur="5.699">experience and told us testimony what</text>
  <text start="566.389" dur="5.37">that tells us is even if you are born</text>
  <text start="569.689" dur="3.69">physically blind without physical eyes</text>
  <text start="571.759" dur="4.62">or without the ability to see and</text>
  <text start="573.379" dur="5.64">physically your spirit still has the</text>
  <text start="576.379" dur="5.07">ability to see in the spiritual world</text>
  <text start="579.019" dur="5.13">now think about this when your physical</text>
  <text start="581.449" dur="4.801">body dies at the end of your life your</text>
  <text start="584.149" dur="5.521">physical body is going to be decomposed</text>
  <text start="586.25" dur="5.879">go back into the ground your spirit is</text>
  <text start="589.67" dur="4.289">going to continue in the spiritual world</text>
  <text start="592.129" dur="3.931">in heaven in eternity</text>
  <text start="593.959" dur="4.651">you&amp;#39;re going to hang out with relatives</text>
  <text start="596.06" dur="4.74">and Jesus and the father how are you</text>
  <text start="598.61" dur="4.95">going to do that how are you going to</text>
  <text start="600.8" dur="3.45">perceive the things that are going on in</text>
  <text start="603.56" dur="2.37">heaven</text>
  <text start="604.25" dur="4.199">you&amp;#39;re going to perceive them through</text>

  <text start="608.449" dur="5.07">that you are going to use in heaven are</text>
  <text start="611.06" dur="5.129">the same spiritual eyes you can use</text>
  <text start="613.519" dur="5.401">right now to see things in the spiritual</text>
  <text start="616.189" dur="5.491">world you have them the problem for a</text>
  <text start="618.92" dur="4.859">lot of us is we don&amp;#39;t think about the</text>
  <text start="621.68" dur="3.659">spiritual realm we don&amp;#39;t think about the</text>
  <text start="623.779" dur="4.41">world of angels and demons we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="625.339" dur="4.891">think about our focus on those things in</text>
  <text start="628.189" dur="5.671">the supernatural realm and whatever</text>
  <text start="630.23" dur="6.12">world whatever realm you focus on that</text>
  <text start="633.86" dur="4.349">is the one that you perceive and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="636.35" dur="4.679">the one that seems to be the most real</text>
  <text start="638.209" dur="6.261">like I said that was an atheist never</text>
  <text start="641.029" dur="6.601">had visions never had dreams but once I</text>
  <text start="644.47" dur="3.849">started to spend time every day with my</text>
  <text start="647.63" dur="3.809">eyes closed</text>
  <text start="648.319" dur="6.051">asking the Holy Spirit to show me things</text>
  <text start="651.439" dur="6.421">in the spiritual world I very slowly</text>
  <text start="654.37" dur="6.1">gradually over months began to see</text>
  <text start="657.86" dur="5.579">images appear in my mind in my</text>
  <text start="660.47" dur="5.01">imagination and I started to have this</text>
  <text start="663.439" dur="3.811">conversation with the Holy Spirit about</text>
  <text start="665.48" dur="4.44">what I was seeing what these images were</text>
  <text start="667.25" dur="5.879">at the beginning it&amp;#39;s very easy to think</text>
  <text start="669.92" dur="5.82">that when you see something in your mind</text>
  <text start="673.129" dur="5.76">in your imagination that you are making</text>
  <text start="675.74" dur="6.55">it up that there is a way that you can</text>
  <text start="678.889" dur="4.84">verify that these things are real</text>
  <text start="682.29" dur="5.549">let me explain what that process looks</text>
  <text start="683.729" dur="6.78">like when I first started engaging the</text>
  <text start="687.839" dur="5.73">spiritual realm through my imagination I</text>
  <text start="690.509" dur="5.461">would sit alone in a dark ambulance and</text>
  <text start="693.569" dur="5.82">have my eyes closed I would do that for</text>
  <text start="695.97" dur="5.789">hours day after day I did this okay this</text>
  <text start="699.389" dur="5.04">is my spiritual training this is</text>
  <text start="701.759" dur="4.8">learning the discipline of developing</text>
  <text start="704.429" dur="4.41">your spiritual vision if you have never</text>
  <text start="706.559" dur="3.9">been able to see angels and demons and</text>
  <text start="708.839" dur="4.02">things in the spiritual world it is</text>
  <text start="710.459" dur="3.72">probably going to help you a lot to get</text>
  <text start="712.859" dur="4.83">in the habit of doing some of these</text>
  <text start="714.179" dur="4.8">exercises now I didn&amp;#39;t know exactly what</text>
  <text start="717.689" dur="3.24">I was doing I didn&amp;#39;t know what I was in</text>
  <text start="718.979" dur="4.71">for I just figured I wanted to see</text>
  <text start="720.929" dur="4.32">visions and so I took some time out of</text>
  <text start="723.689" dur="3.51">my day and closed my eyes</text>
  <text start="725.249" dur="4.86">and sat on the bench seat in the</text>
  <text start="727.199" dur="5.82">ambulance and like I said day after day</text>
  <text start="730.109" dur="5.88">month after month as I did this the Lord</text>
  <text start="733.019" dur="5.61">began to show me images at first they</text>
  <text start="735.989" dur="4.08">were images of people and I would guess</text>
  <text start="738.629" dur="3.841">who the person was</text>
  <text start="740.069" dur="4.92">and then images would change I would see</text>
  <text start="742.47" dur="6.239">more symbolic images the Lord was trying</text>
  <text start="744.989" dur="5.671">to build with me a spiritual language a</text>
  <text start="748.709" dur="4.08">kind of a spiritual dictionary if you</text>
  <text start="750.66" dur="4.259">will I began to see these different</text>
  <text start="752.789" dur="4.441">images and he was trying to get me to</text>
  <text start="754.919" dur="4.86">understand what they represented what</text>
  <text start="757.23" dur="5.639">they symbolized so we had this</text>
  <text start="759.779" dur="5.43">conversation going on and I would guess</text>
  <text start="762.869" dur="4.83">what I thought it meant and if I guessed</text>
  <text start="765.209" dur="4.68">correctly the image would change if I</text>
  <text start="767.699" dur="4.05">guessed incorrectly the image would stay</text>
  <text start="769.889" dur="3.78">there and I would take another guess and</text>
  <text start="771.749" dur="4.17">if I guessed wrong it would stay there</text>
  <text start="773.669" dur="4.681">and I would take another guess I kept on</text>
  <text start="775.919" dur="3.75">guessing until I guessed correctly and</text>
  <text start="778.35" dur="3.75">when I guessed correctly the image would</text>
  <text start="779.669" dur="4.89">change that&amp;#39;s how I knew that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="782.1" dur="5.519">just me making up things in my mind in</text>
  <text start="784.559" dur="5.37">my imagination when I was responding to</text>
  <text start="787.619" dur="4.02">what the Lord was showing me it would</text>
  <text start="789.929" dur="4.291">either change quickly when I guessed it</text>
  <text start="791.639" dur="4.081">correctly or it would stay there and I</text>
  <text start="794.22" dur="3.179">would continue guessing until I</text>
  <text start="795.72" dur="4.109">understood what it was he wanted me to</text>
  <text start="797.399" dur="3.84">know and through this process I learned</text>
  <text start="799.829" dur="3.81">that I was actually having a</text>
  <text start="801.239" dur="6.27">conversation with the Lord through these</text>
  <text start="803.639" dur="5.49">images that I saw in my imagination in</text>
  <text start="807.509" dur="3.721">my book seeing in the spirit made simple</text>
  <text start="809.129" dur="4.591">I have a series of exercises that I</text>
  <text start="811.23" dur="4.789">recommend people do and they work I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="813.72" dur="5.239">had people write back to me and say you</text>
  <text start="816.019" dur="4.831">these exercises are amazing it&amp;#39;s great</text>
  <text start="818.959" dur="3.75">to read the information but if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="820.85" dur="3.719">do the exercises nothing happens I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="822.709" dur="4.891">had several people write to me and say</text>
  <text start="824.569" dur="6.841">that once they began to do the exercises</text>
  <text start="827.6" dur="5.459">regularly they very quickly began seeing</text>
  <text start="831.41" dur="3.659">things in the spiritual world their</text>
  <text start="833.059" dur="4.231">spiritual eyes were opened if you want</text>
  <text start="835.069" dur="5.101">to say that and they were able to start</text>
  <text start="837.29" dur="5.909">perceiving angels and demons and very</text>
  <text start="840.17" dur="5.31">quickly their spiritual vision became</text>
  <text start="843.199" dur="4.08">sharper that again to see things more</text>
  <text start="845.48" dur="3.029">regularly when they would travel into</text>
  <text start="847.279" dur="3.75">the courts of heaven they would see</text>
  <text start="848.509" dur="4.8">things these exercises that I recommend</text>
  <text start="851.029" dur="3.75">are very simple a good way to do it is</text>
  <text start="853.309" dur="4.02">when you&amp;#39;re going to bed spend ten</text>
  <text start="854.779" dur="4.86">minutes looking at into the space</text>
  <text start="857.329" dur="4.98">between where you are sitting and the</text>
  <text start="859.639" dur="5.521">wall across the room have some low light</text>
  <text start="862.309" dur="5.64">and just look into that space and if you</text>
  <text start="865.16" dur="4.56">do it long enough you will see objects</text>
  <text start="867.949" dur="3.961">you&amp;#39;ll see images you&amp;#39;ll begin to see</text>
  <text start="869.72" dur="4.739">things in the spiritual world that you</text>
  <text start="871.91" dur="5.369">never noticed before it sounds crazy but</text>
  <text start="874.459" dur="5.401">I can tell you that if you start doing</text>
  <text start="877.279" dur="4.8">exercises to increase your ability to</text>
  <text start="879.86" dur="4.259">see in the spirit you will begin to see</text>
  <text start="882.079" dur="4.05">things in the spiritual world now</text>
  <text start="884.119" dur="3.871">another exercise you can do is not</text>
  <text start="886.129" dur="4.5">looking with your eyes open which you</text>
  <text start="887.99" dur="5.819">can sit there with your eyes closed and</text>
  <text start="890.629" dur="5.64">ask the Lord to show you images in your</text>
  <text start="893.809" dur="4.111">mind again at first you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="896.269" dur="3.391">think well I&amp;#39;m just making this up it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="897.92" dur="3.779">just my imagination well you know what</text>
  <text start="899.66" dur="4.58">at first it might be it might be you you</text>
  <text start="901.699" dur="4.651">might see images that you think are</text>
  <text start="904.24" dur="4.599">coming from your soul from your</text>
  <text start="906.35" dur="3.75">imagination and that&amp;#39;s true you may but</text>
  <text start="908.839" dur="3.21">if you do this long enough what you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="910.1" dur="5.159">notice is there are two different types</text>
  <text start="912.049" dur="4.921">of images that appear in our mind and</text>
  <text start="915.259" dur="4.5">our imagination there are those that</text>
  <text start="916.97" dur="4.709">appear spontaneously without us</text>
  <text start="919.759" dur="4.5">exercising our will they just show up</text>
  <text start="921.679" dur="4.83">there and if you exert your will over</text>
  <text start="924.259" dur="4.05">them and try to change them you won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="926.509" dur="5.43">able to change them there are other</text>
  <text start="928.309" dur="5.551">images that appear when you more or less</text>
  <text start="931.939" dur="4.19">you focus your mind is on a certain</text>
  <text start="933.86" dur="4.409">thing and then you see the image if you</text>
  <text start="936.129" dur="4.45">intentionally think about your mother or</text>
  <text start="938.269" dur="5.341">your husband or your wife you&amp;#39;ll see an</text>
  <text start="940.579" dur="5.79">image in your mind of them those images</text>
  <text start="943.61" dur="5.309">that appear when we exercise our will or</text>
  <text start="946.369" dur="3.151">focus our mind on something if you try</text>
  <text start="948.919" dur="3.361">to change</text>
  <text start="949.52" dur="4.59">those images and you&amp;#39;re able to change</text>
  <text start="952.28" dur="4.29">them quickly and make the people move</text>
  <text start="954.11" dur="5.4">around if you can exercise your will</text>
  <text start="956.57" dur="5.82">over images that you see in your mind</text>
  <text start="959.51" dur="4.62">they are coming from your soul but if</text>
  <text start="962.39" dur="3.9">you try to exercise your will over</text>
  <text start="964.13" dur="3.9">something you&amp;#39;ve seen your mind and you</text>
  <text start="966.29" dur="4.56">can&amp;#39;t change it and you can&amp;#39;t control it</text>
  <text start="968.03" dur="3.96">it is not coming from you it&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="970.85" dur="3.12">from outside of you</text>
  <text start="971.99" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s either coming from a demon or an</text>
  <text start="973.97" dur="5.43">angel or the Holy Spirit it is something</text>
  <text start="977.39" dur="4.5">you&amp;#39;re seeing that is outside of you</text>
  <text start="979.4" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s probably something that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="981.89" dur="3.72">seeing in the spiritual world and that</text>
  <text start="983.78" dur="5.13">is how you begin to engage the spiritual</text>
  <text start="985.61" dur="5.61">world by looking for these images and</text>
  <text start="988.91" dur="5.4">scenes and things in your mind and</text>
  <text start="991.22" dur="6.12">engage them you might lay there and see</text>
  <text start="994.31" dur="5.52">a door in your mind a good exercise is</text>
  <text start="997.34" dur="4.89">when you see a door go over to it in</text>
  <text start="999.83" dur="3.99">your mind see yourself walking over to</text>
  <text start="1002.23" dur="4.26">it and open it and go through it and see</text>
  <text start="1003.82" dur="5.28">what&amp;#39;s on the other side many times when</text>
  <text start="1006.49" dur="4.59">people do these exercises if you see a</text>
  <text start="1009.1" dur="4.86">door in a hallway and you go through the</text>
  <text start="1011.08" dur="5.37">door you will enter a realm of the</text>
  <text start="1013.96" dur="5.1">spirit you might enter some location in</text>
  <text start="1016.45" dur="4.56">heaven your spirit will engage that you</text>
  <text start="1019.06" dur="4.56">will meet people you won&amp;#39;t talk to them</text>
  <text start="1021.01" dur="4.8">you can engage Jesus and God the Father</text>
  <text start="1023.62" dur="4.11">through these experiences and I would</text>
  <text start="1025.81" dur="3.96">encourage you to try doing that I had a</text>
  <text start="1027.73" dur="5.1">discussion on Facebook this last week</text>
  <text start="1029.77" dur="5.4">about the supernatural realms and there</text>
  <text start="1032.83" dur="5.52">are some misunderstandings about how we</text>
  <text start="1035.17" dur="7.05">engage the spiritual realm how we engage</text>
  <text start="1038.35" dur="6.48">the realms of heaven how we engage Jesus</text>
  <text start="1042.22" dur="5.01">and the father in places like the court</text>
  <text start="1044.83" dur="4.95">of accusation when I described this</text>
  <text start="1047.23" dur="5.37">process where I will close my eyes and</text>
  <text start="1049.78" dur="5.97">in my mind I just see the courtroom and</text>
  <text start="1052.6" dur="5.19">I see my accuser and I hear in my mind</text>
  <text start="1055.75" dur="4.26">to hear these thoughts that are the</text>
  <text start="1057.79" dur="4.5">accusations to some people that sound</text>
  <text start="1060.01" dur="3.99">contrived it sounds like we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1062.29" dur="3.93">conjure this up like we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1064" dur="3.81">create it in our imagination and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1066.22" dur="3.3">not actually what&amp;#39;s happening I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1067.81" dur="4.53">create any of this in my imagination and</text>
  <text start="1069.52" dur="4.86">I know that because sometimes a person</text>
  <text start="1072.34" dur="4.29">will ask me hey can you go to the court</text>
  <text start="1074.38" dur="4.53">of accusation for me and I might say</text>
  <text start="1076.63" dur="3.37">okay sure well when I do that I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1078.91" dur="3.28">see anything</text>
  <text start="1080" dur="4.47">I don&amp;#39;t see a courtroom don&amp;#39;t see a neck</text>
  <text start="1082.19" dur="5.7">user don&amp;#39;t see anything in those cases</text>
  <text start="1084.47" dur="5.37">when I do that I know that that is a</text>
  <text start="1087.89" dur="4.14">person I am not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="1089.84" dur="5.07">representing in the court of accusation</text>
  <text start="1092.03" dur="4.77">so sometimes I will perceive the court</text>
  <text start="1094.91" dur="4.02">and sometimes I won&amp;#39;t and if I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1096.8" dur="4.08">perceive it then I know it didn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="1098.93" dur="5.55">I didn&amp;#39;t go there it was it was not a</text>
  <text start="1100.88" dur="5.4">reality that I experienced I could try</text>
  <text start="1104.48" dur="3.66">to make it up in my imagination but</text>
  <text start="1106.28" dur="3.96">there&amp;#39;s no point doing that and one</text>
  <text start="1108.14" dur="4.41">thing I would like to say is there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1110.24" dur="4.41">nothing wrong with going to represent</text>
  <text start="1112.55" dur="5.31">other people to the courts in heaven but</text>
  <text start="1114.65" dur="4.95">I don&amp;#39;t like to do it as a habit and</text>
  <text start="1117.86" dur="4.2">there are a lot of reasons why I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1119.6" dur="4.68">like doing it first of all when you hear</text>
  <text start="1122.06" dur="3.54">the accusation it may be something that</text>
  <text start="1124.28" dur="3.21">you need to repent of it may be</text>
  <text start="1125.6" dur="4.77">something that has to do with your you</text>
  <text start="1127.49" dur="5.01">know genealogy or your DNA or something</text>
  <text start="1130.37" dur="5.52">in your family if somebody else is doing</text>
  <text start="1132.5" dur="5.58">this for you and they need to repent and</text>
  <text start="1135.89" dur="4.35">renounce some things well that&amp;#39;s hard</text>
  <text start="1138.08" dur="3.84">for someone else to do for you and the</text>
  <text start="1140.24" dur="2.82">other thing is when you go to the court</text>
  <text start="1141.92" dur="3.57">of heaven many times you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="1143.06" dur="4.86">meet Jesus and the father and you know I</text>
  <text start="1145.49" dur="4.35">ask people look if I go there and I may</text>
  <text start="1147.92" dur="4.32">choose this and a father on your behalf</text>
  <text start="1149.84" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t you think it would be better if</text>
  <text start="1152.24" dur="3.78">you were the one to go there and meet</text>
  <text start="1154.49" dur="4.86">with Jesus and meet with the father I</text>
  <text start="1156.02" dur="6.12">think personally this is something we</text>
  <text start="1159.35" dur="4.38">should do for ourselves like I said you</text>
  <text start="1162.14" dur="3.99">can do it for other people and I have</text>
  <text start="1163.73" dur="6.12">done it I think it&amp;#39;s much better off if</text>
  <text start="1166.13" dur="5.82">each of us learns how to engage the</text>
  <text start="1169.85" dur="4.23">spiritual realm if we learn how to go to</text>
  <text start="1171.95" dur="5.52">the courts and councils of heaven for</text>
  <text start="1174.08" dur="6.72">ourselves so we can get our mandates so</text>
  <text start="1177.47" dur="5.67">we can learn and grow in spiritual</text>
