  <text start="44.04" dur="5.4">things we&amp;#39;ve learned so far over the</text>
  <text start="46.41" dur="5.34">last you know 10 messages we&amp;#39;re going to</text>

  <text start="53.04" dur="9.39">some basic bullet points about healing</text>
  <text start="57.9" dur="6.78">and miracles and deliverance to help you</text>
  <text start="62.43" dur="5.94">get kind of understanding of how I</text>
  <text start="64.68" dur="5.76">approach healing and deliverance when</text>
  <text start="68.37" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m actually praying for people whether</text>
  <text start="70.44" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s out on the streets in grocery</text>
  <text start="72.21" dur="5.37">stores and hospitals what the Lord has</text>
  <text start="74.31" dur="6.27">taught me how I approach it practically</text>
  <text start="77.58" dur="6.12">the first thing that you have to know</text>
  <text start="80.58" dur="6.42">about divine healing is that it is all</text>
  <text start="83.7" dur="5.58">about relationship it is about your</text>
  <text start="87" dur="5.28">relationship with God through the Holy</text>
  <text start="89.28" dur="6.99">Spirit the relationship you have with</text>
  <text start="92.28" dur="6.479">God is going to make or break the</text>
  <text start="96.27" dur="7.019">healing dynamic if you are not seeing</text>
  <text start="98.759" dur="7.801">success in healing the first place to</text>
  <text start="103.289" dur="4.79">look for troubleshooting is your</text>
  <text start="106.56" dur="3.57">relationship with the Holy Spirit I</text>
  <text start="108.079" dur="4.33">receive a lot of questions from people</text>
  <text start="110.13" dur="3.839">you know I&amp;#39;ve prayed for people I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="112.409" dur="3.39">tried to get someone healed it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="113.969" dur="5.341">happening what&amp;#39;s wrong first thing I</text>
  <text start="115.799" dur="6.39">always say what has God told you about</text>
  <text start="119.31" dur="4.919">this specific person this condition what</text>
  <text start="122.189" dur="4.47">has he shown you what is the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="124.229" dur="4.771">saying what is he revealing and many</text>
  <text start="126.659" dur="3.96">times people say well I don&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="129" dur="3.96">hear God very well I don&amp;#39;t hear the Holy</text>
  <text start="130.619" dur="4.711">Spirit I don&amp;#39;t really see visions words</text>
  <text start="132.96" dur="5.33">of knowledge that is many times the</text>
  <text start="135.33" dur="7.11">first thing you need to fix because</text>
  <text start="138.29" dur="7.39">healing relies heavily on revelation</text>
  <text start="142.44" dur="4.68">from God he&amp;#39;ll give you tips tricks</text>
  <text start="145.68" dur="3">he&amp;#39;ll give you little things that you</text>
  <text start="147.12" dur="3.96">need to know about if you&amp;#39;re not hearing</text>
  <text start="148.68" dur="3.57">Holy Spirit that is the first thing you</text>
  <text start="151.08" dur="3.45">need</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="5.16">to address is get to know the holy</text>
  <text start="154.53" dur="5.37">spirit get to know his voice get to</text>
  <text start="157.41" dur="5.58">learn how those thoughts that he puts in</text>
  <text start="159.9" dur="6.27">your mind the images that he drops into</text>
  <text start="162.99" dur="5.49">your into your mind those are the ways</text>
  <text start="166.17" dur="4.11">that he communicates to us and you have</text>
  <text start="168.48" dur="3.87">to be able to do that if you want to</text>
  <text start="170.28" dur="4.98">operate successfully kneeling if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="172.35" dur="5.1">not carrying God very well it is gonna</text>
  <text start="175.26" dur="4.32">be a struggle to get people healed</text>
  <text start="177.45" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re just gonna have trouble so the</text>
  <text start="179.58" dur="4.95">first thing I would recommend is build</text>
  <text start="182.19" dur="4.26">that relationship with God strengthen</text>
  <text start="184.53" dur="6.36">that first before you do anything else</text>
  <text start="186.45" dur="7.02">so the second thing is understanding our</text>
  <text start="190.89" dur="5.46">authority that we have from Jesus and</text>
  <text start="193.47" dur="5.87">that is a relational thing the authority</text>
  <text start="196.35" dur="5.7">that we have to remove demons and to</text>
  <text start="199.34" dur="5.98">command bacterial infections and viruses</text>
  <text start="202.05" dur="6.09">to leave that authority comes from our</text>
  <text start="205.32" dur="5.76">relationship with Jesus so again goes</text>
  <text start="208.14" dur="4.5">back to relationship you have to have</text>
  <text start="211.08" dur="3.09">that relationship with Jesus that is</text>
  <text start="212.64" dur="1.98">where we get our authority from for</text>
  <text start="214.17" dur="5.61">healing</text>
  <text start="214.62" dur="7.589">the third thing is power so when we need</text>
  <text start="219.78" dur="5.88">to work a creative miracle when we need</text>
  <text start="222.209" dur="5.331">to create a part of someone&amp;#39;s body</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="4.26">that&amp;#39;s been broken damaged or missing</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="4.509">whether it&amp;#39;s an eardrum or a kidney or</text>
  <text start="229.92" dur="4.05">whatever what we&amp;#39;re trying to do is</text>
  <text start="232.049" dur="4.891">create a new part of the body that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="233.97" dur="6.72">creative miracle miracles are done</text>
  <text start="236.94" dur="6.51">through the release of power or energy</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="4.47">if you will and that comes from the</text>
  <text start="243.45" dur="3.87">power that power comes from the Holy</text>
  <text start="245.16" dur="5.549">Spirit it&amp;#39;s the power of God that lives</text>
  <text start="247.32" dur="7.08">in us what we do is we release the power</text>
  <text start="250.709" dur="5.641">of God that is in us and again it comes</text>
  <text start="254.4" dur="4.14">down to relationship how is your</text>
  <text start="256.35" dur="6.93">relationship doing with the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="258.54" dur="8.16">are you able to let the power of God</text>
  <text start="263.28" dur="6.449">flow out of you jesus said if anyone</text>
  <text start="266.7" dur="6.63">follows me if he believes in me out of</text>
  <text start="269.729" dur="5.731">his innermost being will flow rivers of</text>
  <text start="273.33" dur="4.29">living water that rivers of living water</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="4.889">that flows out of our innermost being</text>
  <text start="277.62" dur="6.06">out of our spirit that is the power that</text>
  <text start="280.349" dur="5.641">works miracles again it goes back to</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="2.599">relationship he said if anyone follows</text>
  <text start="285.99" dur="3.529">me</text>
  <text start="286.279" dur="5.82">so it comes down to knowing the Holy</text>
  <text start="289.519" dur="5.37">Spirit knowing Jesus knowing the will of</text>
  <text start="292.099" dur="4.89">God and it&amp;#39;s all tied up in relationship</text>
  <text start="294.889" dur="3.44">the the building blocks the key</text>
  <text start="296.989" dur="3.42">foundational thing you have to</text>
  <text start="298.329" dur="3.37">understand about healing in Miracles is</text>
  <text start="300.409" dur="1.97">it&amp;#39;s all about your relationship with</text>
  <text start="301.699" dur="4.74">God</text>
  <text start="302.379" dur="7.18">so how do you develop a closer</text>
  <text start="306.439" dur="5.43">relationship with God if you feel like</text>
  <text start="309.559" dur="4.23">maybe God is a little distant like</text>
  <text start="311.869" dur="3.75">you&amp;#39;re not really hearing God maybe</text>
  <text start="313.789" dur="4.47">you&amp;#39;re even questioning whether God</text>
  <text start="315.619" dur="4.08">cares about you how do you develop that</text>
  <text start="318.259" dur="5.76">relationship how do you develop that</text>
  <text start="319.699" dur="7.35">intimacy well it comes in the same way</text>
  <text start="324.019" dur="5.64">you develop any other relationship the</text>
  <text start="327.049" dur="5.52">only way that my wife and I were ever</text>
  <text start="329.659" dur="6.5">able to come together and fall in love</text>
  <text start="332.569" dur="6.51">is because we spent time together</text>
  <text start="336.159" dur="5.56">getting to know each other we talked a</text>
  <text start="339.079" dur="4.5">lot we sent each other messages on our</text>
  <text start="341.719" dur="5.19">phones we&amp;#39;ve talked on our phones we</text>
  <text start="343.579" dur="7.08">called each other we devoted time we set</text>
  <text start="346.909" dur="4.26">time apart daily to get to know each</text>
  <text start="350.659" dur="3.69">other</text>
  <text start="351.169" dur="6.63">time is the commodity of relationships</text>
  <text start="354.349" dur="6.3">if you don&amp;#39;t spend time building the</text>
  <text start="357.799" dur="6.24">relationship with someone you are never</text>
  <text start="360.649" dur="6.36">going to develop any kind of intimacy or</text>
  <text start="364.039" dur="4.38">knowledge of that person so what you</text>
  <text start="367.009" dur="3.11">really need to do if you want to</text>
  <text start="368.419" dur="4.89">strengthen your relationship with God is</text>
  <text start="370.119" dur="7.84">you need to set aside distractions turn</text>
  <text start="373.309" dur="7.95">off the TV turn off your mp3 players and</text>
  <text start="377.959" dur="6.27">your youtube and get quiet and spend</text>
  <text start="381.259" dur="5.25">time regularly I would say daily at</text>
  <text start="384.229" dur="4.83">initially if you&amp;#39;re struggling in your</text>
  <text start="386.509" dur="5.82">relationship with God you probably need</text>
  <text start="389.059" dur="6.27">to spend some time every day getting to</text>
  <text start="392.329" dur="5.88">know him being quiet being still letting</text>
  <text start="395.329" dur="6.21">your mind focus on the voice of God on</text>
  <text start="398.209" dur="5.87">the heart of God so that&amp;#39;s kind of where</text>
  <text start="401.539" dur="6.15">I would start out at is spend some time</text>
  <text start="404.079" dur="6.07">listening hearing perceiving letting God</text>
  <text start="407.689" dur="5.46">show you visions that&amp;#39;s what I did when</text>
  <text start="410.149" dur="5.31">I wanted to learn how to see visions</text>
  <text start="413.149" dur="4.53">when I wanted to learn yeah turn off</text>
  <text start="415.459" dur="3">periscope turn off Facebook get off</text>
  <text start="417.679" dur="2.111">Facebook</text>

  <text start="419.79" dur="4.74">writing a book I have to get off</text>
  <text start="421.14" dur="7.14">Facebook because it&amp;#39;s too distracting my</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="6.69">books that I write I&amp;#39;m trying as much as</text>
  <text start="428.28" dur="4.68">possible to translate what I hear the</text>
  <text start="431.22" dur="3.9">Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s saying and I can&amp;#39;t hear</text>
  <text start="432.96" dur="4.83">the Holy Spirit very well if my mind is</text>
  <text start="435.12" dur="4.74">on social media so I shut down my social</text>
  <text start="437.79" dur="5.22">media accounts and then I spend a week</text>
  <text start="439.86" dur="5.3">or two or three or six hearing God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="443.01" dur="4.83">voice hearing what he&amp;#39;s saying and</text>
  <text start="445.16" dur="4.81">transcribing that into a book or a blog</text>
  <text start="447.84" dur="3.72">post I have to do the same thing I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="449.97" dur="3.48">telling other people to do you have to</text>
  <text start="451.56" dur="3.93">get time away from all the clutter and</text>
  <text start="453.45" dur="4.35">the noise of society if you want to hear</text>
  <text start="455.49" dur="4.44">God it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s critical there&amp;#39;s no other</text>
  <text start="457.8" dur="3.36">way around it that&amp;#39;s why why do you</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="3.3">think he lied you would go and hide in a</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="5.48">cave for a while he wanted to hear God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="463.23" dur="6.86">voice get away from all the noise so</text>
  <text start="466.64" dur="7.06">building the relationship with God</text>
  <text start="470.09" dur="6.43">requires setting time aside like any</text>
  <text start="473.7" dur="4.53">other relationship you have to set time</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="5.7">aside if you want to get to know</text>
  <text start="478.23" dur="6.39">somebody now moving to the next part of</text>
  <text start="482.22" dur="5.25">the healing dynamic which is actually</text>
  <text start="484.62" dur="5.64">praying for people to be healed I spoke</text>
  <text start="487.47" dur="5.61">a couple of weeks ago on God&amp;#39;s presence</text>
  <text start="490.26" dur="5.7">and taught you a little bit about God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="493.08" dur="6">glory I played some music I got some</text>
  <text start="495.96" dur="6.68">words of knowledge and I invited God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="499.08" dur="6.03">presence to touch people and it was</text>
  <text start="502.64" dur="5.44">ridiculous how many people sent me</text>
  <text start="505.11" dur="5.1">private messages on facebook on Twitter</text>
  <text start="508.08" dur="2.64">and through email who listened to that</text>
  <text start="510.21" dur="2.67">message</text>
  <text start="510.72" dur="5.04">many people listened to the podcast a</text>
  <text start="512.88" dur="4.53">number of them felt healing many people</text>
  <text start="515.76" dur="6.42">felt tingling in their body different</text>
  <text start="517.41" dur="8.49">sensations God&amp;#39;s presence is a key part</text>
  <text start="522.18" dur="6.87">of healing ministry I always invite</text>
  <text start="525.9" dur="4.26">God&amp;#39;s presence to touch the person when</text>
  <text start="529.05" dur="2.82">I&amp;#39;m praying for them to be healed</text>
  <text start="530.16" dur="4.2">and you should do that too you should</text>
  <text start="531.87" dur="5.61">learn how to cooperate with God he</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="5.61">should learn how ask him to bring his</text>
  <text start="537.48" dur="5.21">presence number one number two know how</text>
  <text start="539.97" dur="6.42">to sense his presence when it&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="542.69" dur="7.39">because sometimes the way God&amp;#39;s presence</text>
  <text start="546.39" dur="6.24">manifests how you feel it will give you</text>
  <text start="550.08" dur="3.25">a clue as to what God wants to do with</text>
  <text start="552.63" dur="4.09">that person</text>
  <text start="553.33" dur="8.129">stealing so God&amp;#39;s presence is a big</text>
  <text start="556.72" dur="8.79">thing the next thing to consider with</text>
  <text start="561.459" dur="7.32">healing is faith there are many</text>
  <text start="565.51" dur="8.12">different components to divine healing</text>
  <text start="568.779" dur="7.981">but faith is one of the pillars faith</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="5.98">releases power the power of the Holy</text>
  <text start="576.76" dur="5.79">Spirit that is in us is released by</text>
  <text start="579.61" dur="6.36">faith and the authority that we</text>
  <text start="582.55" dur="6.84">exercised over demons and sickness is</text>
  <text start="585.97" dur="4.859">exercised by faith so you are not going</text>
  <text start="589.39" dur="3.11">to release power and you&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="590.829" dur="5.01">exercise authority without faith and</text>
  <text start="592.5" dur="6.839">faith may start out small but it has to</text>
  <text start="595.839" dur="6.301">grow like a mustard seed we have to</text>
  <text start="599.339" dur="5.801">address this issue of faith and unbelief</text>
  <text start="602.14" dur="4.62">and doubt if you are filled with doubt</text>
  <text start="605.14" dur="2.43">and unbelief that&amp;#39;s okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="606.76" dur="2.37">understandable</text>
  <text start="607.57" dur="3.69">when you begin praying for people to be</text>
  <text start="609.13" dur="5.76">healed you&amp;#39;re going to have some doubt</text>
  <text start="611.26" dur="6.09">and skepticism most of us do but as you</text>
  <text start="614.89" dur="4.11">pray for more people and as you see the</text>
  <text start="617.35" dur="3.51">power of God at work and I just see</text>
  <text start="619" dur="4.47">people healed your faith is going to</text>
  <text start="620.86" dur="4.11">grow and there are some things you can</text>
  <text start="623.47" dur="3.47">do to grow your faith and I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="624.97" dur="4.89">talk about those in just a few minutes</text>
  <text start="626.94" dur="5.56">one thing that will boost your faith</text>
  <text start="629.86" dur="6.51">that&amp;#39;ll give you more confidence in</text>

  <text start="797.37" dur="6.79">one of the keys that helped me grow in</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="5.459">faith for healing was getting around</text>
  <text start="804.16" dur="5.669">other people who were successfully</text>
  <text start="806.439" dur="5.611">operating in healing I I got involved in</text>
  <text start="809.829" dur="3.601">this fairly large group on Facebook it</text>
  <text start="812.05" dur="4.409">was hundreds of people from all around</text>
  <text start="813.43" dur="6.23">the world and today that group of people</text>
  <text start="816.459" dur="6.681">is thousands from every country</text>
  <text start="819.66" dur="4.77">and we would share testimonies and we</text>
  <text start="823.14" dur="3.48">would have group discussions about</text>
  <text start="824.43" dur="4.05">healing we would talk about obstacles we</text>
  <text start="826.62" dur="4.98">talk about our successes we would share</text>
  <text start="828.48" dur="5.61">testimonies would compare notes and I</text>
  <text start="831.6" dur="5.34">did this on a daily basis for several</text>
  <text start="834.09" dur="6.18">years I watched videos of people like</text>
  <text start="836.94" dur="5.01">Todd white and Bill Johnson I watched as</text>
  <text start="840.27" dur="4.95">people were being healed on the streets</text>
  <text start="841.95" dur="5.37">and listen to podcast I read books Jon</text>
  <text start="845.22" dur="3.78">whimpers book power Healing is a great</text>
  <text start="847.32" dur="5.01">book it really encouraged me</text>
  <text start="849" dur="5.7">I&amp;#39;ve write books and I put out podcast</text>
  <text start="852.33" dur="5.94">and YouTube videos because I want to</text>
  <text start="854.7" dur="5.84">encourage you to operate in the same</text>
  <text start="858.27" dur="5.01">power and authority that I&amp;#39;m doing</text>
  <text start="860.54" dur="5.08">because that kind of information helped</text>
  <text start="863.28" dur="3.06">me get started and it helped me get to</text>
  <text start="865.62" dur="4.65">where I am now</text>
  <text start="866.34" dur="6.42">so one thing to do if you really want to</text>
  <text start="870.27" dur="5.37">be successful in healing is get around</text>
  <text start="872.76" dur="5.64">people who are operating in healing ask</text>
  <text start="875.64" dur="5.04">questions and compare notes but you will</text>
  <text start="878.4" dur="3.99">find yourself developing more boldness</text>
  <text start="880.68" dur="2.4">for stepping out and praying for people</text>
  <text start="882.39" dur="2.61">to be healed</text>
  <text start="883.08" dur="3.81">you&amp;#39;ll get your questions answered and</text>

  <text start="1583.25" dur="6">know of the last bit of advice I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="1586.43" dur="4.53">to give you is follow up with people</text>
  <text start="1589.25" dur="3.54">that you&amp;#39;ve prayed for whenever it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1590.96" dur="4.74">possible if you can stay in touch with</text>
  <text start="1592.79" dur="6.15">someone that you&amp;#39;ve prayed for follow up</text>
  <text start="1595.7" dur="4.89">with them because what&amp;#39;ll happen many</text>
  <text start="1598.94" dur="3.63">times is you&amp;#39;ll pray for someone and</text>
  <text start="1600.59" dur="3.9">they won&amp;#39;t feel any any difference</text>
  <text start="1602.57" dur="4.05">they&amp;#39;ll feel no change you&amp;#39;ll pray for a</text>
  <text start="1604.49" dur="5.43">sprained wrist then they&amp;#39;ll feel no</text>
  <text start="1606.62" dur="5.37">difference while you&amp;#39;re there if you</text>
  <text start="1609.92" dur="3.6">fall off with them in a week you&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="1611.99" dur="3.27">surprised how many people are gonna say</text>
  <text start="1613.52" dur="3.87">you know I didn&amp;#39;t feel anything right</text>
  <text start="1615.26" dur="4.38">away but then I went home and a half</text>
  <text start="1617.39" dur="5.03">hour later my wrist was like completely</text>
  <text start="1619.64" dur="5.33">pain-free it was great I have</text>
  <text start="1622.42" dur="4.14">had that happened to me many times a lot</text>
  <text start="1624.97" dur="4.17">of the patients that I&amp;#39;ve prayed for in</text>
  <text start="1626.56" dur="6.21">the ambulance I ran into later either</text>
  <text start="1629.14" dur="4.95">saw them on another call or went back to</text>
  <text start="1632.77" dur="3.24">the gas station where they were what I</text>
  <text start="1634.09" dur="4.35">prayed for him and I found out the</text>
  <text start="1636.01" dur="5.52">people who felt nothing at the time they</text>
  <text start="1638.44" dur="4.38">got tests and they had a relief of</text>
  <text start="1641.53" dur="4.05">symptoms and they were completely healed</text>
  <text start="1642.82" dur="5.7">and I wouldn&amp;#39;t have known that if I had</text>
  <text start="1645.58" dur="4.62">not followed up with them so when you</text>
  <text start="1648.52" dur="4.32">pray for someone if nothing happens</text>
  <text start="1650.2" dur="5.67">don&amp;#39;t assume they weren&amp;#39;t healed many</text>
  <text start="1652.84" dur="5.76">times 10 15 20 minutes later or the next</text>
  <text start="1655.87" dur="5.49">day they&amp;#39;ll realize wow I actually was</text>
  <text start="1658.6" dur="6.03">healed and following up with those</text>
  <text start="1661.36" dur="7.14">people will help you get a better feel</text>
  <text start="1664.63" dur="5.6">for how successful you are it&amp;#39;s easy to</text>
  <text start="1668.5" dur="5.34">get discouraged when people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1670.23" dur="6.13">manifest the healing right away but many</text>
  <text start="1673.84" dur="3.99">times the healing just it takes them a</text>
  <text start="1676.36" dur="3.75">while for them to understand that oh</text>
  <text start="1677.83" dur="3.72">yeah they actually were healed my my</text>
  <text start="1680.11" dur="3.96">favorite story is a guy that I prayed</text>
  <text start="1681.55" dur="5.1">for in the ambulance he had a severe GI</text>
  <text start="1684.07" dur="4.86">bleed he had a blood transfusion before</text>
  <text start="1686.65" dur="3.66">I transported him I took him to this</text>

  <text start="1696.76" dur="4.74">discharged no surgery they scan him</text>
  <text start="1700.06" dur="3.15">again they did all the tests they could</text>
  <text start="1701.5" dur="3.96">find no bleeding he was completely</text>
  <text start="1703.21" dur="4.05">healed through prayer and I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
