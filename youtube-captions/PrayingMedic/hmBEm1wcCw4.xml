  <text start="195.81" dur="5.399">right</text>
  <text start="196.11" dur="6.53">and she is a linchpin to this whole</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="6.811">thing</text>
  <text start="202.64" dur="8.05">now Q asks a question back in March will</text>
  <text start="208.02" dur="4.68">the rich and powerful prevent the</text>
  <text start="210.69" dur="5.549">records from the courts from being</text>
  <text start="212.7" dur="6.03">unsealed if the documents of the court</text>
  <text start="216.239" dur="8.191">documents are unsealed much is going to</text>
  <text start="218.73" dur="8.52">be revealed now we know that in June</text>
  <text start="224.43" dur="6.42">just two or three weeks ago the judge in</text>
  <text start="227.25" dur="9.47">this case ordered records to be unsealed</text>
  <text start="230.85" dur="10.109">and there was a lot of chatter among</text>
  <text start="236.72" dur="6.519">people from in the court system saying</text>
  <text start="240.959" dur="4.831">look we&amp;#39;re going to unseal these records</text>
  <text start="243.239" dur="5.521">but they were warning the media not to</text>
  <text start="245.79" dur="7.62">make assumptions not to get ahead of the</text>
  <text start="248.76" dur="6.03">story not to accuse people or assume</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="4.549">people are guilty but just because</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="6.33">they&amp;#39;re named in these court documents</text>
  <text start="257.959" dur="5.171">so there&amp;#39;s a lot of concern over these</text>
  <text start="261.12" dur="4.41">documents being made public they have</text>
  <text start="263.13" dur="4.34">not yet been made public the judge</text>
  <text start="265.53" dur="6.2">ordered 2000 page</text>
  <text start="267.47" dur="7.62">of court documents to be unsealed and he</text>
  <text start="271.73" dur="5.43">is allowing motions to be filed by</text>
  <text start="275.09" dur="5.55">attorneys representing people that are</text>
  <text start="277.16" dur="6.93">involved in this case so the judge has</text>
  <text start="280.64" dur="5.82">to look at motions to keep certain</text>
  <text start="284.09" dur="3.78">things secret what&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="286.46" dur="3.24">redacted what is not going to be</text>
  <text start="287.87" dur="2.22">redacted what is going to be released to</text>
  <text start="289.7" dur="2.25">the public</text>
  <text start="290.09" dur="4.47">court documents have not been made</text>
  <text start="291.95" dur="5.67">public but the judge has decided they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="294.56" dur="5.43">going to be unsealed all right so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="297.62" dur="3.84">answering cues first question where the</text>
  <text start="299.99" dur="2.79">are the rich and powerful going to</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="4.2">influence the court to prevent the</text>
  <text start="302.78" dur="5.7">unsealing know they were not successful</text>
  <text start="305.66" dur="4.2">now follow the attorney I&amp;#39;ll give you</text>
  <text start="308.48" dur="4.56">just a little bit of information on this</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="7.5">so Q asked who was behind the camera</text>
  <text start="313.04" dur="9.68">follow the attorney the an amicus brief</text>
  <text start="317.36" dur="10.89">was filed in this case on behalf of</text>
  <text start="322.72" dur="8.949">anonymous parties by Nicholas Lewin he</text>
  <text start="328.25" dur="7.68">was the attorney who filed the brief it</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="7.861">is believed that Nicholas Lewin was</text>
  <text start="335.93" dur="5.31">involved in this case he is known to be</text>
  <text start="339.53" dur="3.75">involved with some of these people so I</text>
  <text start="341.24" dur="5.7">would suggest write down the name</text>
  <text start="343.28" dur="5.43">Nicholas Lewin l e wi n that is a name</text>
  <text start="346.94" dur="5.46">we&amp;#39;re probably going to be seeing in the</text>
  <text start="348.71" dur="6.81">headlines in the future all right he is</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="6.9">he&amp;#39;s the attorney that filed a brief to</text>
  <text start="355.52" dur="4.7">keep these documents sealed so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="359.3" dur="6.48">number one</text>
  <text start="360.22" dur="9.699">so Epstein gets picked up after he</text>
  <text start="365.78" dur="7.86">returns from France to the US and this</text>
  <text start="369.919" dur="7.681">plane he gets nabbed he his arraignment</text>
  <text start="373.64" dur="6.21">is today he faces essentially he faces</text>
  <text start="377.6" dur="4.37">two charges one charge of sex</text>
  <text start="379.85" dur="6.9">trafficking one charge of conspiracy</text>
  <text start="381.97" dur="8.23">relatively low counts I mean it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="386.75" dur="4.74">two charges let me talk about the</text>
  <text start="390.2" dur="5.64">Florida case first</text>
  <text start="391.49" dur="6.98">so Epstein was was given a deal in the</text>
  <text start="395.84" dur="7.44">case that was prosecuted in Florida</text>
  <text start="398.47" dur="7.69">where he agreed to provide information</text>
  <text start="403.28" dur="5.73">and they agreed not to process it was a</text>
  <text start="406.16" dur="4.62">non-prosecution agreement right okay</text>
  <text start="409.01" dur="4.65">people have been up in arms about that</text>
  <text start="410.78" dur="4.92">screaming that this is a miscarriage of</text>
  <text start="413.66" dur="3.99">justice and there&amp;#39;s people on both sides</text>
  <text start="415.7" dur="6.029">Dershowitz saying oh you know went</text>
  <text start="417.65" dur="5.25">through all of the the the normal chain</text>
  <text start="421.729" dur="3.481">of command it went all the way up</text>
  <text start="422.9" dur="4.59">through the highest levels of the DOJ it</text>
  <text start="425.21" dur="4.56">was it was approved by all the right</text>
  <text start="427.49" dur="5.429">people well let&amp;#39;s just remember that</text>
  <text start="429.77" dur="9.709">Robert Muller was head of the FBI when</text>
  <text start="432.919" dur="9.901">this was all going in 2007 2008 2009</text>
  <text start="439.479" dur="9.961">Muller was a head of the FBI and Holder</text>
  <text start="442.82" dur="11.94">was was Attorney General so some of that</text>
  <text start="449.44" dur="7.3">activity may come under review all right</text>
  <text start="454.76" dur="4.62">so there&amp;#39;s an article now that Fox just</text>
  <text start="456.74" dur="8.179">published and this is why what I want to</text>
  <text start="459.38" dur="8.039">walk you through former FBI official</text>
  <text start="464.919" dur="6.161">says the indictment of Jeffrey Epstein</text>
  <text start="467.419" dur="7.411">the current new indictment is likely a</text>
  <text start="471.08" dur="5.1">placeholder he expects dozens of more</text>
  <text start="474.83" dur="4.92">charges in the near future</text>
  <text start="476.18" dur="6.06">now the placeholder word is his word not</text>
  <text start="479.75" dur="4.34">mine that&amp;#39;s what he says so this guy is</text>
  <text start="482.24" dur="4.59">a former Deputy Director of the FBI</text>
  <text start="484.09" dur="4.259">assistant director his name is Chris</text>
  <text start="486.83" dur="4.25">sweater</text>
  <text start="488.349" dur="6.041">he believes the two count indictment</text>
  <text start="491.08" dur="8.29">brought against Epstein was to get him</text>
  <text start="494.39" dur="7.279">off the street as fast as possible he</text>
  <text start="499.37" dur="5.49">says I think the decision was made that</text>
  <text start="501.669" dur="4.99">his conduct was ongoing and he believes</text>
  <text start="504.86" dur="3.51">that this simple to count indictment was</text>
  <text start="506.659" dur="4.411">simply done quickly to get him off the</text>
  <text start="508.37" dur="5.82">street now I just had written to</text>
  <text start="511.07" dur="5.13">somebody on Twitter about 45 minutes ago</text>
  <text start="514.19" dur="6.87">where we were discussing this and I said</text>
  <text start="516.2" dur="7.83">I think the DOJ realized they were in a</text>
  <text start="521.06" dur="7.26">difficult spot and they had to pull the</text>
  <text start="524.03" dur="8.12">trigger and get and file charges against</text>
  <text start="528.32" dur="6.9">Epstein and arrest him because because</text>
  <text start="532.15" dur="6.04">the judge unsealed</text>
  <text start="535.22" dur="6.47">those court documents that is why I</text>
  <text start="538.19" dur="7.59">believe is my belief that is why I think</text>
  <text start="541.69" dur="7.3">the DOJ had to make a move had the court</text>
  <text start="545.78" dur="5.58">not decided to unseal those court</text>
  <text start="548.99" dur="6.15">documents none of that information would</text>
  <text start="551.36" dur="6.63">have been made public but now the DOJ</text>
  <text start="555.14" dur="8.16">knows after these motions are filed to</text>
  <text start="557.99" dur="6.9">keep certain parts of it&amp;#39;s secret that</text>
  <text start="563.3" dur="4.44">information is going to be made public</text>
  <text start="564.89" dur="4.65">and when those court documents are made</text>
  <text start="567.74" dur="3.39">public there&amp;#39;s going to be a public</text>
  <text start="569.54" dur="4.56">outcry for prosecution</text>
  <text start="571.13" dur="5.43">all right so just kind of follow her I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="574.1" dur="5.64">going here the the thing that started</text>
  <text start="576.56" dur="7.68">this all was when the judge decided to</text>
  <text start="579.74" dur="9.06">unseal the court records at that point</text>
  <text start="584.24" dur="5.78">the DOJ realized oh great now all this</text>
  <text start="588.8" dur="3.48">evidence is going to be made public</text>
  <text start="590.02" dur="3.73">people are going to find out the names</text>
  <text start="592.28" dur="4.559">of the rich and powerful</text>
  <text start="593.75" dur="4.62">the politicians potentially people in</text>
  <text start="596.839" dur="2.851">Hollywood the wealthy and powerful</text>
  <text start="598.37" dur="3.39">people their names are going to be made</text>
  <text start="599.69" dur="5.7">public and there&amp;#39;s going to be a public</text>
  <text start="601.76" dur="5.689">outcry for justice so the DOJ got put in</text>
  <text start="605.39" dur="6.05">a very bad spot because they had already</text>
  <text start="607.449" dur="6.221">approved a non-prosecution agreement and</text>
  <text start="611.44" dur="5.32">now the court is going to make a bunch</text>
  <text start="613.67" dur="6.539">of documents public that makes a DOJ</text>
  <text start="616.76" dur="6.24">look very very bad so Southern District</text>
  <text start="620.209" dur="7.111">of New York says okay fine</text>
  <text start="623" dur="6.75">we will impanel a grand jury and we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="627.32" dur="3.93">get indictment against Epstein we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="629.75" dur="4.199">pick them up pull arrest him we&amp;#39;ll put</text>
  <text start="631.25" dur="3.9">him on charges and then we&amp;#39;ll move</text>
  <text start="633.949" dur="4.681">forward and see where this is going to</text>
  <text start="635.15" dur="6.27">go right because the DOJ was in a very</text>
  <text start="638.63" dur="4.86">bad spot the optics of this are horrible</text>
  <text start="641.42" dur="5.039">once those court documents are made</text>
  <text start="643.49" dur="6.03">public and the people know who the who</text>
  <text start="646.459" dur="6.261">was involved and what was alleged to</text>
  <text start="649.52" dur="6.36">have happened it&amp;#39;s going to be a public</text>
  <text start="652.72" dur="5.26">relations nightmare for the DOJ so they</text>
  <text start="655.88" dur="4.5">didn&amp;#39;t have a choice they had to pick up</text>
  <text start="657.98" dur="5.46">have steam I think further just for</text>
  <text start="660.38" dur="5.22">there purely for optic reasons so at</text>
  <text start="663.44" dur="2.88">Southern District of New York</text>
  <text start="665.6" dur="2.64">picks up</text>
  <text start="666.32" dur="4.53">scene on Saturday he&amp;#39;s arraigned today</text>
  <text start="668.24" dur="7.32">now let me just continue reading this</text>
  <text start="670.85" dur="6.54">particle from Fox it says a former FBI</text>
  <text start="675.56" dur="3.69">official on Monday said the federal</text>
  <text start="677.39" dur="6.18">indictment against Epstein is a</text>
  <text start="679.25" dur="6.15">placeholder I just love that word right</text>
  <text start="683.57" dur="3.12">we&amp;#39;ve all been looking at if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="685.4" dur="3.78">following Q you know that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="686.69" dur="6">placeholders on the Patriots fight right</text>
  <text start="689.18" dur="5.13">what is a placeholder it is a an item</text>
  <text start="692.69" dur="3.36">that takes the place of something that</text>
  <text start="694.31" dur="5.88">is going to come in the future right</text>
  <text start="696.05" dur="6.42">so this FBI former assistant director</text>
  <text start="700.19" dur="4.59">says he believes prosecutors will be</text>
  <text start="702.47" dur="4.74">bringing a much larger superseding</text>
  <text start="704.78" dur="5.16">indictment in the future now what is a</text>
  <text start="707.21" dur="6.45">superseding indictment having served</text>
  <text start="709.94" dur="5.55">some time in a grand jury in Arizona we</text>
  <text start="713.66" dur="3.42">call it a supervening indictment but in</text>
  <text start="715.49" dur="5.76">other places they call it a superseding</text>
  <text start="717.08" dur="8.79">indictment when a person is charged with</text>
  <text start="721.25" dur="6.36">a crime they go to an arraignment and at</text>
  <text start="725.87" dur="3.27">the arraignment their charges are read</text>
  <text start="727.61" dur="4.38">and they either plead guilty not guilty</text>
  <text start="729.14" dur="7.13">they enter a plea and then the judge</text>
  <text start="731.99" dur="7.14">decides if they are going to be held</text>
  <text start="736.27" dur="5.02">until the trial or if they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="739.13" dur="6.03">be released on bail okay</text>
  <text start="741.29" dur="6.54">that&amp;#39;s the arraignment either way</text>
  <text start="745.16" dur="6.71">whether the person is released or held</text>
  <text start="747.83" dur="9.21">they&amp;#39;re going to have a series of court</text>
  <text start="751.87" dur="10.48">proceedings including a trial anytime</text>
  <text start="757.04" dur="7.32">prior to the trial the prosecutors can</text>
  <text start="762.35" dur="4.56">take the original indictment so what</text>
  <text start="764.36" dur="5.49">happens in in states that have a grand</text>
  <text start="766.91" dur="5.91">jury that use grand juries the grand</text>
  <text start="769.85" dur="7.62">jury hands over an indictment to the</text>
  <text start="772.82" dur="8.31">prosecutor they hear evidence they</text>
  <text start="777.47" dur="6.84">usually in in like in county grand</text>
  <text start="781.13" dur="5.52">juries like the one that I was on county</text>
  <text start="784.31" dur="3.93">grand jury will hear the charges and</text>
  <text start="786.65" dur="3.48">then they&amp;#39;ll hear evidence usually from</text>
  <text start="788.24" dur="3.96">a law enforcement officer who kind of</text>
  <text start="790.13" dur="4.89">presents information and then the grand</text>
  <text start="792.2" dur="6.45">jury votes whether to hand over an</text>
  <text start="795.02" dur="4.869">indictment or not all right the</text>
  <text start="798.65" dur="3.52">indictment</text>
  <text start="799.889" dur="4.531">is then used in the arraignment to</text>
  <text start="802.17" dur="6.18">charge the suspect okay</text>
  <text start="804.42" dur="6.99">at any time prior to after the original</text>
  <text start="808.35" dur="6">arraignment and before the trial the</text>
  <text start="811.41" dur="7.139">attorneys can bring more charges against</text>
  <text start="814.35" dur="5.819">the suspect any future charges a new</text>
  <text start="818.549" dur="6.27">indictment is called a supervening or</text>
  <text start="820.169" dur="8.431">superseding indictment so the current to</text>
  <text start="824.819" dur="6.99">count felony count indictment against</text>
  <text start="828.6" dur="6.449">Epstein this guy says is likely to be</text>
  <text start="831.809" dur="5.88">replaced with a larger indictment with</text>
  <text start="835.049" dur="4.741">more charges involving more people right</text>
  <text start="837.689" dur="4.05">so if you think that these two charges</text>
  <text start="839.79" dur="4.489">is all the Epstein&amp;#39;s gonna face likely</text>
  <text start="841.739" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s not the case there will likely be</text>
  <text start="844.279" dur="5.86">he says larger indictment more charges</text>
  <text start="848.129" dur="2.19">more people a lot more going on all</text>
  <text start="850.139" dur="3.69">right</text>
  <text start="850.319" dur="6.36">that is in at some point in the future</text>
  <text start="853.829" dur="6.66">when the DOJ gets together with their</text>
  <text start="856.679" dur="5.07">people and they talk to the US</text>
  <text start="860.489" dur="2.79">Attorney&amp;#39;s Office Southern District New</text>
  <text start="861.749" dur="4.471">York they&amp;#39;ll also want to talk to</text>
  <text start="863.279" dur="6.59">probably the US Attorney&amp;#39;s Office in</text>
  <text start="866.22" dur="10.44">Florida because interestingly enough</text>
  <text start="869.869" dur="8.89">read this part to you once the the once</text>
  <text start="876.66" dur="5.399">secret deal this was the plea deal that</text>
  <text start="878.759" dur="6.781">the Epstein got in Florida then the</text>
  <text start="882.059" dur="4.95">non-prosecution agreement was revealed</text>
  <text start="885.54" dur="4.379">and the Miami Herald did their</text>
  <text start="887.009" dur="5.13">investigative work it was challenged in</text>
  <text start="889.919" dur="5.91">a federal court the judge ruled earlier</text>
  <text start="892.139" dur="6.24">that that that in that case Epstein&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="895.829" dur="4.68">victims were not consult their attorneys</text>
  <text start="898.379" dur="5.851">were not consulted and they should have</text>
  <text start="900.509" dur="6.211">been and it&amp;#39;s potentially a violation of</text>
  <text start="904.23" dur="6.149">federal law and the judge may invalidate</text>
  <text start="906.72" dur="6">that non-prosecution agreement so the</text>
  <text start="910.379" dur="5.4">DOJ has to look at this non-prosecution</text>
  <text start="912.72" dur="4.769">agreement that came out of Miami and</text>
  <text start="915.779" dur="3.21">they have to decide whether they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="917.489" dur="4.861">going to just drop that and get rid of</text>
  <text start="918.989" dur="6.63">it or allow a federal judge to over to</text>
  <text start="922.35" dur="5.519">basically get invalidate that agreement</text>
  <text start="925.619" dur="4.08">in any case it looks like that</text>
  <text start="927.869" dur="4.77">non-prosecution agreement is not going</text>
  <text start="929.699" dur="4.771">to stand and as you learned in the press</text>
  <text start="932.639" dur="3.301">conference a smart</text>
  <text start="934.47" dur="3.63">the attorney from the Southern District</text>
  <text start="935.94" dur="4.199">New York said their US Attorney&amp;#39;s Office</text>
  <text start="938.1" dur="6.21">is not bound by the non-prosecution</text>
  <text start="940.139" dur="7.531">agreement that Epstein had with the US</text>
  <text start="944.31" dur="5.339">Attorney&amp;#39;s Office in Florida so what</text>
  <text start="947.67" dur="4.83">happened in Florida really is sort of</text>
  <text start="949.649" dur="4.761">irrelevant at this point because SD NY</text>
  <text start="952.5" dur="7.829">can do whatever they want to do and</text>
  <text start="954.41" dur="10">according to this former assistant FBI</text>
  <text start="960.329" dur="8.82">director Chris wet Chris Walker he</text>
  <text start="964.41" dur="14.299">believes that there will be dozens of</text>
  <text start="969.149" dur="12.531">charges in the future so that is look</text>
  <text start="978.709" dur="9.341">here&amp;#39;s like I said when I started this</text>
  <text start="981.68" dur="8.95">according to Q ray Chandler is the</text>
  <text start="988.05" dur="6.349">linchpin in all of this what happens</text>
  <text start="990.63" dur="5.73">with Epstein is really almost secondary</text>
  <text start="994.399" dur="4.151">Epstein was used</text>
  <text start="996.36" dur="5.089">now Epstein was a participant but</text>
  <text start="998.55" dur="8.46">Epstein was also used very likely</text>
  <text start="1001.449" dur="7.811">alleged to have been used to trap to</text>
  <text start="1007.01" dur="6.66">entrap politicians wealthy people</text>
  <text start="1009.26" dur="6.389">powerful people into these compromising</text>
  <text start="1013.67" dur="3.93">sexual situations get video on them and</text>
  <text start="1015.649" dur="3.451">then you have blackmail against them and</text>
  <text start="1017.6" dur="2.64">you can get them to do whatever you want</text>
  <text start="1019.1" dur="4.71">because you&amp;#39;ve got blackmail on them</text>
  <text start="1020.24" dur="6.51">right that&amp;#39;s the honeypot thing it has</text>
  <text start="1023.81" dur="6.379">been used for a long time to get power</text>
  <text start="1026.75" dur="3.439">over politicians and wealthy people</text>
  <text start="1030.64" dur="5.77">according to Q ray Chandler is the</text>
  <text start="1033.14" dur="5.699">linchpin in all of this ray Chandler if</text>
  <text start="1036.41" dur="5.429">they can get her to testify now you</text>
  <text start="1038.839" dur="6.21">remember back when the nexium trial we</text>
  <text start="1041.839" dur="5.011">just got done with that aliceandmac when</text>
  <text start="1045.049" dur="5.88">she was arrested I believe it was April</text>
  <text start="1046.85" dur="6.449">20th of last year Q said before anything</text>
  <text start="1050.929" dur="4.701">was made public hew said that Alison Mac</text>
  <text start="1053.299" dur="7.221">was talking and naming names</text>
  <text start="1055.63" dur="7.36">Allison Mac&amp;#39;s testimony brought the</text>
  <text start="1060.52" dur="5.47">charges and the conviction of the people</text>
  <text start="1062.99" dur="4.47">in the neck cm sex cult all right Q said</text>
  <text start="1065.99" dur="5.13">that ray Chandler</text>
  <text start="1067.46" dur="6.42">aliceandmac times 100 there are so many</text>
  <text start="1071.12" dur="6.299">people involved in what Epstein has been</text>
  <text start="1073.88" dur="6.299">doing and ray Chandler is the key if</text>
  <text start="1077.419" dur="5.911">they get her to testify against all</text>
  <text start="1080.179" dur="5.761">these people it&amp;#39;s game over there gonna</text>
  <text start="1083.33" dur="6">be a lot of people arrested and locked</text>
  <text start="1085.94" dur="5.88">up and the so ray Chandler is the key</text>
  <text start="1089.33" dur="3.99">but the beginning of it all was when the</text>
  <text start="1091.82" dur="4.829">judge decided to make those court</text>
  <text start="1093.32" dur="5.7">documents public that forced the DOJ to</text>
  <text start="1096.649" dur="4.14">revisit Epstein&amp;#39;s case and realize we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1099.02" dur="3.659">got to charge this guy we can&amp;#39;t let it</text>
  <text start="1100.789" dur="5.581">we can&amp;#39;t let this go for the sake of</text>
  <text start="1102.679" dur="5.49">optics it&amp;#39;s not gonna happen so I I</text>
  <text start="1106.37" dur="4.71">expect now the DOJ is going to go</text>
  <text start="1108.169" dur="5.161">full-court press on Epstein and whoever</text>
  <text start="1111.08" dur="3.36">else they can get involved in this and I</text>
  <text start="1113.33" dur="3.829">think it&amp;#39;s going to take down a lot of</text>
  <text start="1114.44" dur="5.339">corrupt people a lot of politicians</text>
  <text start="1117.159" dur="4.691">Nancy Pelosi&amp;#39;s daughter gets on Twitter</text>
