  <text start="0.61" dur="4.09">well there and there&amp;#39;s two thoughts and</text>
  <text start="2.87" dur="3.51">one is natural the others spiritual but</text>
  <text start="4.7" dur="4.979">in fact in my world that both are both</text>
  <text start="6.38" dur="6.32">connected when God raised up Daniel in</text>
  <text start="9.679" dur="5.841">Babylon for instance here you&amp;#39;ve got a</text>
  <text start="12.7" dur="6.13">thirteen-year-old kid raised by a</text>
  <text start="15.52" dur="6.43">foreign country and he was a conquered</text>
  <text start="18.83" dur="5.73">minority he is castrated in order to be</text>
  <text start="21.95" dur="4.2">part of the king&amp;#39;s eunuchs he has every</text>
  <text start="24.56" dur="3.96">reason in the world to become a bitter</text>
  <text start="26.15" dur="3.57">and defeated young man and he goes on to</text>
  <text start="28.52" dur="4.35">become one of the great heroes of</text>
  <text start="29.72" dur="5.97">biblical literature what it says about</text>
  <text start="32.87" dur="6.89">Daniel it&amp;#39;s interesting is that Daniel</text>
  <text start="35.69" dur="7.44">and his friends were learn it in the</text>
  <text start="39.76" dur="4.99">sciences knowledge wisdom and literature</text>
  <text start="43.13" dur="4.01">and language of the Chaldeans which</text>
  <text start="44.75" dur="6.6">meant they were socially relevant</text>
  <text start="47.14" dur="5.02">academically informed and and an in</text>
  <text start="51.35" dur="3.03">business sense</text>
  <text start="52.16" dur="5.76">it says they knew how to behave in</text>
  <text start="54.38" dur="6.75">King&amp;#39;s palaces so God gave them an</text>
  <text start="57.92" dur="4.95">ability to excel and that word excel in</text>
  <text start="61.13" dur="3.26">the Hebrew some pretty flippy word it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="62.87" dur="3.96">the word yet tear it literally means</text>
  <text start="64.39" dur="4.69">something which juts out higher than</text>
  <text start="66.83" dur="5.28">others so you could say it&amp;#39;s somebody</text>
  <text start="69.08" dur="5.94">who stands out and when I look at Daniel</text>
  <text start="72.11" dur="5.73">I realized that God gave him a gift or a</text>
  <text start="75.02" dur="5.7">natural gift and it&amp;#39;s associates for</text>
  <text start="77.84" dur="5.25">acquiring languages and science and</text>
  <text start="80.72" dur="5.009">knowledge and stuff like that but what</text>
  <text start="83.09" dur="7.11">Daniel did was he was able to leverage</text>
  <text start="85.729" dur="6.451">that acumen and that talent into up into</text>
  <text start="90.2" dur="4.65">a an ability to merge it with a</text>
  <text start="92.18" dur="5.189">supernatural capacity and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="94.85" dur="4.5">supernatural capacity is what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="97.369" dur="4.441">a gift cluster it&amp;#39;s a combination</text>
  <text start="99.35" dur="5.519">usually when a person has a super net as</text>
  <text start="101.81" dur="4.5">a gift that God has given them that it</text>
  <text start="104.869" dur="3.631">moves in a group and people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="106.31" dur="3.599">realize they&amp;#39;re clustered in his case he</text>
  <text start="108.5" dur="3.45">had the ability to dissolve doubts</text>
  <text start="109.909" dur="4.051">interpret dreams solve riddles and</text>
  <text start="111.95" dur="3.419">understand the nygma&amp;#39;s now that may not</text>
  <text start="113.96" dur="2.67">mean much to anyone out there except</text>
  <text start="115.369" dur="3.271">that you talk about four things you need</text>
  <text start="116.63" dur="3.48">to do in the economy it&amp;#39;s you know you</text>
  <text start="118.64" dur="2.79">have to dissolve the doubt to people</text>
  <text start="120.11" dur="2.79">that are resilient anxiety have to</text>
  <text start="121.43" dur="3.03">figure out trends you have to solve</text>
  <text start="122.9" dur="3.42">enigmas that don&amp;#39;t make any sense you</text>
  <text start="124.46" dur="3.6">have to anticipate the future this is</text>
  <text start="126.32" dur="3.689">what Joseph did in Egypt this is what</text>
  <text start="128.06" dur="3.899">Daniel did in Babylon and for the most</text>
  <text start="130.009" dur="3.781">part when you think of a religious</text>
  <text start="131.959" dur="4.11">calling people think of a</text>
  <text start="133.79" dur="4.199">Caprice Dora pentecostal you know the</text>
  <text start="136.069" dur="3.48">guy with a Plexiglas pulpit the last</text>
  <text start="137.989" dur="3.181">thing they think of is a politician a</text>
  <text start="139.549" dur="3.36">government guy or an economist but</text>
  <text start="141.17" dur="5.069">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the real realm these guys</text>
  <text start="142.909" dur="5.791">operated in Daniel went head and</text>
  <text start="146.239" dur="5.181">shoulders above others because he took</text>
  <text start="148.7" dur="5.52">the god-given natural talent and</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="4.239">consecrated it to God&amp;#39;s purposes and</text>
  <text start="154.22" dur="3.72">that&amp;#39;s one of the great keys that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="155.659" dur="4.83">seeing happening more and more is people</text>
  <text start="157.94" dur="4.799">that have disciplined their talent to be</text>
  <text start="160.489" dur="4.351">good at what they do and it may not look</text>
  <text start="162.739" dur="3.75">like a religious field it&amp;#39;s in the arts</text>
  <text start="164.84" dur="3.149">it&amp;#39;s media it&amp;#39;s business it&amp;#39;s government</text>
  <text start="166.489" dur="2.941">but what they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="167.989" dur="3.181">discovering God is a God of the whole</text>
  <text start="169.43" dur="3.54">earth he&amp;#39;s not limited to just Church in</text>
  <text start="171.17" dur="4.53">the corner of Sunday he actually owns</text>
  <text start="172.97" dur="4.32">the whole property so they&amp;#39;re emerging</text>
  <text start="175.7" dur="4.439">in these fields and what&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="177.29" dur="4.589">interesting is I&amp;#39;m studying what it is</text>
  <text start="180.139" dur="5.041">that enables someone to be preeminent in</text>
  <text start="181.879" dur="5.28">a field and the natural part is that</text>
  <text start="185.18" dur="5.04">anyone who is at the top of a profession</text>
  <text start="187.159" dur="4.92">whether they honor God or don&amp;#39;t has</text>
  <text start="190.22" dur="4.109">somehow intuitively are intentionally</text>
  <text start="192.079" dur="4.83">capitalized on four or five signature</text>
  <text start="194.329" dur="5.641">strengths they&amp;#39;ve identified what they</text>
  <text start="196.909" dur="6.36">do best they&amp;#39;ve identified the talent</text>
  <text start="199.97" dur="5.19">that the basic synaptic talent God wired</text>
  <text start="203.269" dur="3.78">into their brain and body so that</text>
  <text start="205.16" dur="4.68">they&amp;#39;re leveraging their god-given</text>
  <text start="207.049" dur="4.261">talent design and they&amp;#39;re not doing what</text>
  <text start="209.84" dur="3.69">they don&amp;#39;t do well they&amp;#39;re only doing</text>
  <text start="211.31" dur="4.2">what they do well the second thing which</text>
  <text start="213.53" dur="5.31">is fascinating is if you ever watched</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="6.18">American Idol notice that the the ones</text>
  <text start="218.84" dur="4.32">who failed which is my children this</text>
  <text start="221.69" dur="3.57">sadistic there while I&amp;#39;m watching these</text>
  <text start="223.16" dur="3.57">these young people go singing their guts</text>
  <text start="225.26" dur="3.33">out the 20 million people and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="226.73" dur="3.119">carry and no and I&amp;#39;m wondering didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="228.59" dur="2.489">anybody and their family pull him aside</text>
  <text start="229.849" dur="3.211">before they got on national television</text>
  <text start="231.079" dur="3.451">and say Harry yeah we know you love</text>
  <text start="233.06" dur="3.69">music but you can&amp;#39;t sing for anything</text>
  <text start="234.53" dur="4.26">nobody does that but Harry&amp;#39;s there in my</text>
  <text start="236.75" dur="4.29">living room and I&amp;#39;m going oh poor kid</text>
  <text start="238.79" dur="5.309">he&amp;#39;s and and what happens is you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="241.04" dur="4.5">people that are rejected by this group</text>
  <text start="244.099" dur="2.64">and they&amp;#39;re so preoccupied with the</text>
  <text start="245.54" dur="2.52">passion of what they&amp;#39;re trying to do</text>
  <text start="246.739" dur="3.271">they&amp;#39;re not even looking at the signals</text>
  <text start="248.06" dur="3.959">and so what you&amp;#39;ll notice is peak</text>
  <text start="250.01" dur="4.559">performers are quick to take feedback</text>
  <text start="252.019" dur="4.231">and the ones that end up at the top of</text>
  <text start="254.569" dur="3.181">the food chain that end up going on to</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="3.209">that you know opening night and getting</text>
  <text start="257.75" dur="4.229">the ticket to Hollywood and auditioning</text>
  <text start="259.459" dur="5.671">watch how they receive feedback every</text>
  <text start="261.979" dur="4.861">one of them pulls it in and takes you</text>
  <text start="265.13" dur="2.2">see it&amp;#39;s almost like they absorb it that</text>
  <text start="266.84" dur="3.43">fast you know</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="6.059">why the ability to capitalize on your</text>
  <text start="270.27" dur="5.549">signature strengths and receive feedback</text>
  <text start="273.389" dur="5.34">is the combination of a peak performer</text>
  <text start="275.819" dur="5.07">now now that&amp;#39;s what qualifies you to be</text>
  <text start="278.729" dur="4.65">at the top of the mountain ad this</text>
  <text start="280.889" dur="4.74">elusive spiritual factor you and I are</text>
  <text start="283.379" dur="4.41">talking about and you start to have the</text>
  <text start="285.629" dur="4.26">excellence or the up tier that Daniel</text>
  <text start="287.789" dur="4.65">had Joseph had nema it&amp;#39;s a group that</text>
  <text start="289.889" dur="4.411">have that are limiting that that have</text>
  <text start="292.439" dur="3.45">better living with receptivity to</text>
  <text start="294.3" dur="3.78">feedback which is what we call</text>
  <text start="295.889" dur="3.691">constraint theory they know where the</text>
  <text start="298.08" dur="2.97">lid is in their life and they&amp;#39;re always</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="3.54">exploring how to make how to move that</text>
  <text start="301.05" dur="3.079">lid higher and they&amp;#39;re leveraging what</text>
  <text start="303.12" dur="3.449">they do best</text>
  <text start="304.129" dur="4.54">across the board I find that with all of</text>
  <text start="306.569" dur="4.5">the peak performers before I get to</text>
  <text start="308.669" dur="3.631">introduce them to Jesus or if they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="311.069" dur="2.82">even meet Jesus and we&amp;#39;re still in a</text>
  <text start="312.3" dur="3.239">little waltz together and I&amp;#39;m coming I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="313.889" dur="3.75">still their best coach because I&amp;#39;m using</text>
  <text start="315.539" dur="3.391">my gifts to help get results in their</text>
  <text start="317.639" dur="2.611">life no one else can get because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="318.93" dur="3.78">hearing information when I&amp;#39;m working</text>
  <text start="320.25" dur="4.319">with them how did you know that that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="322.71" dur="3.989">why I&amp;#39;m your coach but God&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="324.569" dur="4.56">about how to help unfold destiny the</text>
  <text start="326.699" dur="4.97">part that I want to really nail and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="329.129" dur="8.641">thinking about it with you is the</text>
  <text start="331.669" dur="10.3">ability to to then yield this talent and</text>
  <text start="337.77" dur="6.6">this this feedback receptivity to the</text>
  <text start="341.969" dur="6.241">Spirit of God produces a force called</text>
  <text start="344.37" dur="6.57">favor and favor is what the law of</text>
  <text start="348.21" dur="5.34">attraction that the secret the DVD is</text>
  <text start="350.94" dur="5.129">trying to talk about but it&amp;#39;s talking</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="4.5">about it in kind of a of a cosmic way</text>
  <text start="356.069" dur="3.481">that doesn&amp;#39;t have as much specificity as</text>
  <text start="358.05" dur="5.88">it could because here&amp;#39;s what this favor</text>
  <text start="359.55" dur="8.369">is it&amp;#39;s a spiritual magnetism that wraps</text>
  <text start="363.93" dur="6.12">itself around a person who is charged</text>
  <text start="367.919" dur="5.37">with a divine assignment that they are</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="5.429">in the process of unfolding a person can</text>
  <text start="373.289" dur="4.68">be doing an assignment and not even be a</text>
  <text start="375.479" dur="4.081">believer because this this is a little</text>
  <text start="377.969" dur="3.331">freaky for my religious friends to think</text>
  <text start="379.56" dur="3.69">about but you know everybody wants to</text>
  <text start="381.3" dur="5.28">have like an election time they want to</text>
  <text start="383.25" dur="6">have some righteous man of God to vote</text>
  <text start="386.58" dur="4.889">for well if you are alive during the</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="5.43">Second World War the watered-down</text>
  <text start="391.469" dur="6.591">whiskey drinking scotch smoking a cigar</text>
  <text start="394.68" dur="5.39">smoking backroom dealer of</text>
  <text start="398.06" dur="4.2">of Winston Churchill would not have</text>
  <text start="400.07" dur="4.53">appealed to most of our spiritual</text>
  <text start="402.26" dur="4.02">sensitivities Neville Chamberlain was</text>
  <text start="404.6" dur="3.93">more the evangelical he was the</text>
  <text start="406.28" dur="4.26">clean-cut teetotaling peace in our time</text>
  <text start="408.53" dur="4.53">unfortunately he was the guy that got a</text>
  <text start="410.54" dur="5.94">war started God anointed Churchill to</text>
  <text start="413.06" dur="6.78">end it so God will put his anointing on</text>
  <text start="416.48" dur="5.31">kings and rulers because their gifts and</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="4.08">calling and talent is for an hour in</text>
  <text start="421.79" dur="3.51">history and Churchill&amp;#39;s a classic</text>
  <text start="423.92" dur="3.09">example of someone who was a</text>
  <text start="425.3" dur="3.39">disappointment if you were looking for a</text>
  <text start="427.01" dur="3.93">wiglesworth and you know type of</text>
  <text start="428.69" dur="4.26">character but it was the prayers of guys</text>
  <text start="430.94" dur="3.66">like wiglesworth who was a man who</text>
  <text start="432.95" dur="4.8">raised the dead as a plumber in England</text>
  <text start="434.6" dur="5.22">that put Churchill into office so</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="3.66">Lincoln was a disappointment to most the</text>
  <text start="439.82" dur="3.99">revivalist because he wouldn&amp;#39;t even go</text>
  <text start="441.41" dur="4.71">to church history now says Lincoln was</text>
  <text start="443.81" dur="4.38">the best president we ever had well he</text>
  <text start="446.12" dur="3.99">was he was almost like omniscient the</text>
  <text start="448.19" dur="3.81">way he made decisions such wisdom and</text>
  <text start="450.11" dur="4.26">and there&amp;#39;s evidence that he became a</text>
  <text start="452" dur="4.11">believer after Gettysburg but he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="454.37" dur="4.5">go into Washington as a believer and the</text>
  <text start="456.11" dur="5.91">reason I&amp;#39;m saying this is because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="458.87" dur="4.86">because God is real and he&amp;#39;s so real he</text>
  <text start="462.02" dur="3.27">is in places most people don&amp;#39;t look and</text>
  <text start="463.73" dur="3.38">he&amp;#39;s so infinitely confident he&amp;#39;s even</text>
  <text start="465.29" dur="3.93">using people most people wouldn&amp;#39;t choose</text>
  <text start="467.11" dur="4.06">so I can talk to all of them and</text>
  <text start="469.22" dur="3.66">appreciate where they&amp;#39;re at and and when</text>
  <text start="471.17" dur="4.68">that when they start moving in their</text>
  <text start="472.88" dur="4.56">calling their gifting and they take</text>
  <text start="475.85" dur="3.27">feedback Lincoln Churchill or</text>
  <text start="477.44" dur="4.5">characteristics they move on what Maslow</text>
  <text start="479.12" dur="4.59">called actualization they&amp;#39;re at the peak</text>
  <text start="481.94" dur="3.51">of the game they&amp;#39;re using a hundred</text>
  <text start="483.71" dur="3.75">percent of the god-given capacity and a</text>
  <text start="485.45" dur="4.65">cause that is larger than themselves and</text>
  <text start="487.46" dur="5.1">so they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re a torch fully used up</text>
  <text start="490.1" dur="4.2">and history their footprint in history</text>
  <text start="492.56" dur="4.71">they leave a legacy they leave a mark</text>
  <text start="494.3" dur="4.56">indelibly on mankind but what makes them</text>
  <text start="497.27" dur="4.44">fascinating to me is the favor factor</text>
  <text start="498.86" dur="7.74">favored by my definition is the</text>
  <text start="501.71" dur="7.35">attraction of God to you that releases</text>
  <text start="506.6" dur="5.79">an influence through you so that every</text>
  <text start="509.06" dur="5.94">resource you need materializes in order</text>
  <text start="512.39" dur="5.34">to accomplish the assignment God gave</text>
  <text start="515" dur="6.03">you and so for Lincoln it was saved the</text>
  <text start="517.73" dur="5.52">Union for Churchill it was our finest</text>
  <text start="521.03" dur="4.89">hour and throughout history you&amp;#39;ll see</text>
  <text start="523.25" dur="5.58">God has champions he raises up who are</text>
  <text start="525.92" dur="4.83">using his gifts growing through the</text>
  <text start="528.83" dur="4.08">constraints that they&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="530.75" dur="4.98">in an assignment and annoyed to it favor</text>
  <text start="532.91" dur="3.929">and at the end of their life some cases</text>
  <text start="535.73" dur="3.33">they arrived at faith</text>
  <text start="536.839" dur="4.23">Churchill I&amp;#39;m not so sure about he was</text>
