  <text start="8.79" dur="6.389">Q or Q and on in this video I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="12.36" dur="5.91">give you a brief overview of what we</text>
  <text start="15.179" dur="6.031">know about Q and hopefully dispel some</text>
  <text start="18.27" dur="6.24">misinformation back in October of 2017</text>
  <text start="21.21" dur="6.45">an anonymous person began posting on the</text>
  <text start="24.51" dur="5.279">internet message board called 4chan the</text>
  <text start="27.66" dur="4.95">interesting thing about posting on 4chan</text>
  <text start="29.789" dur="6.481">and HN is that you&amp;#39;re given a unique</text>
  <text start="32.61" dur="5.789">alphanumeric ID but it keeps you</text>
  <text start="36.27" dur="4.14">anonymous you&amp;#39;re not given a name or</text>
  <text start="38.399" dur="4.201">anything so when you post on those</text>
  <text start="40.41" dur="4.829">boards no one really knows who you are</text>
  <text start="42.6" dur="4.68">from time to time people will go on the</text>
  <text start="45.239" dur="4.021">boards and they&amp;#39;ll claim to be</text>
  <text start="47.28" dur="4.709">government insiders inside the FBI</text>
  <text start="49.26" dur="4.619">Department of Justice etc well these</text>
  <text start="51.989" dur="4.291">people typically last for a couple of</text>
  <text start="53.879" dur="6.391">days they post information that they say</text>
  <text start="56.28" dur="5.13">is insider information sometimes they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="60.27" dur="4.23">predict that someone&amp;#39;s going to be</text>
  <text start="61.41" dur="3.569">arrested and then they&amp;#39;re never heard</text>
  <text start="64.5" dur="5.82">from again</text>
  <text start="64.979" dur="8.311">well in October of 2017 a person showed</text>
  <text start="70.32" dur="7.95">up on 4chan and they introduced himself</text>
  <text start="73.29" dur="8.16">as a Q clearance Patriot now back story</text>
  <text start="78.27" dur="4.739">on Q clearance it is a very high level</text>
  <text start="81.45" dur="4.349">security clearance it&amp;#39;s issued by the</text>
  <text start="83.009" dur="4.68">Department of Energy q has never claimed</text>
  <text start="85.799" dur="4.5">to work for the Department of Energy</text>
  <text start="87.689" dur="6.331">they just introduced themselves as aq</text>
  <text start="90.299" dur="7.471">Clarence Patriot so this person has been</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="6.029">posting on 4chan they posted there for</text>
  <text start="97.77" dur="3.389">about a month or two and because there</text>
  <text start="100.049" dur="2.491">were a lot of trolls and a lot of</text>
  <text start="101.159" dur="4.441">problems they eventually ended up moving</text>
  <text start="102.54" dur="5.34">over to H n this the board</text>
  <text start="105.6" dur="6.72">administrators set up a specific board</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="6.48">just for Q to post on on H n so Q has</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="5.67">posted on several different boards over</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="6.81">the length of time but Q has also given</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="5.729">some pretty convincing evidence that Q</text>
  <text start="121.17" dur="4.67">is the same person posting today that</text>
  <text start="123.719" dur="4.441">was posting back in October of last year</text>
  <text start="125.84" dur="5.169">unlike a lot of people who show up on</text>
  <text start="128.16" dur="5.07">4chan and hn and claim to be government</text>
  <text start="131.009" dur="4.711">insiders but they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="133.23" dur="5.009">after a few days queue has been posting</text>
  <text start="135.72" dur="4.349">consistently for eight months and queue</text>
  <text start="138.239" dur="4.591">seems to read almost all of the</text>
  <text start="140.069" dur="6.06">responses to the things any posts few</text>
  <text start="142.83" dur="5.579">often replies to the anons on the board</text>
  <text start="146.129" dur="3.36">sometimes queue will ask questions for</text>
  <text start="148.409" dur="3.3">further research</text>
  <text start="149.489" dur="5.521">and speaking of research part of queues</text>
  <text start="151.709" dur="5.461">mission is to ask us to do research on a</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="3.93">variety of different subjects you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="157.17" dur="2.97">have to be a researcher to follow queue</text>
  <text start="158.94" dur="3.09">there are plenty of people that are</text>
  <text start="160.14" dur="5.01">doing research I happen to be one of</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="5.25">them my role in the queue movement is I</text>
  <text start="165.15" dur="6.51">take screenshots of the things acute</text>
  <text start="167.28" dur="6.84">posts on HN i will take the images i&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="171.66" dur="4.799">post them on twitter i will include</text>
  <text start="174.12" dur="5.16">links some texts and comments and</text>
  <text start="176.459" dur="4.92">observations that i made i try to make</text>
  <text start="179.28" dur="5.819">connections of different things the</text>
  <text start="181.379" dur="6.08">queue posts i often will include older</text>
  <text start="185.099" dur="5.25">posts because queue will often tell us</text>
  <text start="187.459" dur="4.661">reread previous drops on the certain</text>
  <text start="190.349" dur="4.11">subject so sometimes i&amp;#39;ll go back and</text>
  <text start="192.12" dur="4.89">look at older posts at queues put out</text>
  <text start="194.459" dur="4.89">tie them into newer ones put in news</text>
  <text start="197.01" dur="4.94">articles and then give kind of a summary</text>
  <text start="199.349" dur="7.411">of what i&amp;#39;ve found on a particular video</text>
  <text start="201.95" dur="7.06">now I should say this some of the people</text>
  <text start="206.76" dur="4.17">who follow queue are would consider</text>
  <text start="209.01" dur="4.02">themselves to be conspiracy theorists I</text>
  <text start="210.93" dur="4.709">do not consider myself to be a</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="5.1">conspiracy theorist I consider myself to</text>
  <text start="215.639" dur="4.35">be a queue researcher I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="3.78">anything against people who like to</text>
  <text start="219.989" dur="4.321">follow conspiracies that&amp;#39;s their thing</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s not my thing I tend to stick pretty</text>
  <text start="224.31" dur="5.07">closely to the subjects at Q Poussin and</text>
  <text start="226.95" dur="4.619">I tend to avoid unnecessary rabbit</text>
  <text start="229.38" dur="6.27">trails a common question people ask me</text>
  <text start="231.569" dur="7.681">is who is Q my short answer is I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="235.65" dur="6.51">know no one really knows who Q is and by</text>
  <text start="239.25" dur="4.98">the way it does seem as though cute is a</text>
  <text start="242.16" dur="5.31">team of people rather than an individual</text>
  <text start="244.23" dur="5.369">you will sometimes write in terms of we</text>
  <text start="247.47" dur="5.4">and us as a team</text>
  <text start="249.599" dur="5.85">Q will sometimes sign a post Q plus I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="252.87" dur="5.1">come to understand that that means Q and</text>
  <text start="255.449" dur="3.72">the team Q seems to be a small group of</text>
  <text start="257.97" dur="3.239">people that are very close to the</text>

  <text start="266.28" dur="3.51">get ahold of</text>
  <text start="267.06" dur="4.859">if you weren&amp;#39;t very very close to the</text>
