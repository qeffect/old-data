  <text start="8.809" dur="5.29">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.79" dur="4.88">I&amp;#39;m your host praying medic here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="14.099" dur="2.571">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="18.16" dur="7.33">hey David what the heck is going on</text>
  <text start="22.07" dur="6.33">mister what&amp;#39;s not going on isn&amp;#39;t that an</text>
  <text start="25.49" dur="18.69">easier question oh my gosh are we ready</text>
  <text start="28.4" dur="18.29">for aerial spraying of Valium yet let me</text>
  <text start="44.18" dur="7.95">figure out what&amp;#39;s going on first yeah</text>
  <text start="46.69" dur="9.25">so Rex Tillerson had a little speech in</text>
  <text start="52.13" dur="6.57">the capital of Turkey and Cara and said</text>
  <text start="55.94" dur="7.47">something very interesting so it&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="58.7" dur="8.58">kind of Obama&amp;#39;s policy that in order for</text>
  <text start="63.41" dur="4.14">peace talks to move forward Assad has to</text>
  <text start="67.28" dur="5.13">go</text>
  <text start="67.55" dur="7.319">and Tillerson essentially said at this</text>
  <text start="72.41" dur="5.43">point it&amp;#39;s up to the people of Syria to</text>
  <text start="74.869" dur="5.041">decide if Assad is gonna stay or go so</text>
  <text start="77.84" dur="6">he has not made it mandatory that Assad</text>
  <text start="79.91" dur="6.27">has to go and that has been Putin&amp;#39;s view</text>
  <text start="83.84" dur="4.29">all along is it you know the the people</text>
  <text start="86.18" dur="4.95">of Syria have a right to decide who the</text>
  <text start="88.13" dur="6.169">president&amp;#39;s going to be so now Moscow</text>
  <text start="91.13" dur="3.169">and Washington are on the same page</text>
  <text start="95.47" dur="5.85">let&amp;#39;s just say they&amp;#39;re halfway to the</text>
  <text start="98.27" dur="7.02">same page yeah moving in that direction</text>
  <text start="101.32" dur="6.909">moving towards the table anyway what our</text>
  <text start="105.29" dur="6.78">goal here is from Trump&amp;#39;s side was to</text>
  <text start="108.229" dur="5.581">mitigate this absolute terminology that</text>
  <text start="112.07" dur="3.74">the Obama administration was using at</text>
  <text start="113.81" dur="4.739">Assad&amp;#39;s gotta go Assad&amp;#39;s got to go and</text>
  <text start="115.81" dur="5.23">Trump if you notice during the campaign</text>
  <text start="118.549" dur="4.081">was was not utilizing any type of</text>
  <text start="121.04" dur="2.789">absolute terminology when it came to</text>
  <text start="122.63" dur="6.09">Syria other than in fact that he</text>
  <text start="123.829" dur="7.47">censored his comments to just mostly</text>
  <text start="128.72" dur="4.65">exclude everything but Isis and the fact</text>
  <text start="131.299" dur="3.481">that Isis was allowed to grow in the</text>
  <text start="133.37" dur="3.48">region and all the things that your</text>
  <text start="134.78" dur="4.709">listeners already that they deliberately</text>
  <text start="136.85" dur="4.169">allowed this to grow to force Assad to</text>
  <text start="139.489" dur="3.78">the table and try to get him out of</text>
  <text start="141.019" dur="5.041">Dodge and if that didn&amp;#39;t work they had a</text>
  <text start="143.269" dur="4.021">proven record of taking these types of</text>
  <text start="146.06" dur="3.72">people and throwing them right out of</text>
  <text start="147.29" dur="3.779">their events whether it&amp;#39;s a gypped or</text>
  <text start="149.78" dur="2.789">Libya they were just</text>
  <text start="151.069" dur="3.59">looking for regime change one way or</text>
  <text start="152.569" dur="3.961">another whether you&amp;#39;re dragged out of a</text>
  <text start="154.659" dur="4.511">construction pipe and beaten to death</text>
  <text start="156.53" dur="5.34">live on on YouTube or whether you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="159.17" dur="4.319">thrown out in exile like I like to</text>
  <text start="161.87" dur="3.39">happen in Egypt and allow the Muslim</text>
  <text start="163.489" dur="5.09">Brotherhood to come in and and kind of</text>
  <text start="165.26" dur="5.789">take over with a a seemingly deep fanged</text>
  <text start="168.579" dur="4.541">Sisi who will eventually probably rise</text>
  <text start="171.049" dur="3.84">up and be a real problem for us so the</text>
  <text start="173.12" dur="4.44">short answer is with that long preamble</text>
  <text start="174.889" dur="4.651">the short answer is I believe Trump will</text>
  <text start="177.56" dur="4.439">and the administration will insist on an</text>
  <text start="179.54" dur="6.86">election once we have a cessation of</text>
  <text start="181.999" dur="7.291">arms where we we back out of supporting</text>
  <text start="186.4" dur="4.899">any particular group in that region and</text>
  <text start="189.29" dur="4.71">Russia backs out of supporting Assad&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="191.299" dur="6.81">military we come to the table and we</text>
  <text start="194" dur="6.599">basically demand a UN a UN monitored</text>
  <text start="198.109" dur="5.46">election to occur within a set number of</text>
  <text start="200.599" dur="6.03">months where the people of Syria can</text>
  <text start="203.569" dur="4.801">come back and vote or they are going to</text>
  <text start="206.629" dur="3.601">be allowed to vote abroad as</text>
  <text start="208.37" dur="4.47">traditionally is allowed one refugee</text>
  <text start="210.23" dur="5.129">status is confirmed for the people of</text>
  <text start="212.84" dur="4.859">the country so see I wouldn&amp;#39;t say Assad</text>
  <text start="215.359" dur="4.291">is necessarily safe yet I would say if</text>
  <text start="217.699" dur="5.22">nothing else out of this civil war</text>
  <text start="219.65" dur="5.459">there&amp;#39;s a potential for a openly</text>
  <text start="222.919" dur="4.201">reviewed and monitored election cycle to</text>
  <text start="225.109" dur="2.91">put aside on a ballot for the first time</text>
  <text start="227.12" dur="3.299">legitimately</text>
  <text start="228.019" dur="4.56">and for a lot of people who were you</text>
  <text start="230.419" dur="3.84">know displaced they&amp;#39;re lost family had</text>
  <text start="232.579" dur="4.891">their homes destroyed lost everything</text>
  <text start="234.259" dur="6.6">that they own that is this small you</text>
  <text start="237.47" dur="5.129">know sliver of hope a silver lining in</text>
  <text start="240.859" dur="3.75">the cloud that could possibly come out</text>
  <text start="242.599" dur="4.14">of all the death and destruction would</text>
  <text start="244.609" dur="3.63">be that Russia and America both say okay</text>
  <text start="246.739" dur="3.81">we&amp;#39;re going to take a coin and flip it</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="5.161">50/50 heads or tails kind of side</text>
  <text start="250.549" dur="6.15">survivor a legitimate election right and</text>
  <text start="253.4" dur="5.79">I think that&amp;#39;s probably what Tillerson</text>
  <text start="256.699" dur="3.84">set us on the path to if you&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="259.19" dur="3.99">asking me for my opinion I would say</text>
  <text start="260.539" dur="4.711">that&amp;#39;s the smartest way to go I really</text>
  <text start="263.18" dur="5.01">don&amp;#39;t think you can entrench yourselves</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="5.34">any further to try to root him out and</text>
  <text start="268.19" dur="4.38">actually get gunned him down on the</text>
  <text start="270.59" dur="4.71">streets of Damascus it&amp;#39;s not going to</text>
  <text start="272.57" dur="5.21">happen the Gaddafi scenario is not is</text>
  <text start="275.3" dur="4.859">not going to happen right in in Syria</text>
  <text start="277.78" dur="5.199">seems like the best thing to do is focus</text>
  <text start="280.159" dur="3.961">on you know in unify on the one thing</text>
  <text start="282.979" dur="2.151">that they all agree on which is getting</text>
  <text start="284.12" dur="3.57">rid of Isis</text>
  <text start="285.13" dur="4.12">yeah yeah yeah they said this will put</text>
  <text start="287.69" dur="3.66">him in effectively in a chokehold David</text>
  <text start="289.25" dur="5.1">because they would not they would not</text>
  <text start="291.35" dur="4.71">have a safe ground to turn either they</text>
  <text start="294.35" dur="4.35">turned towards Damascus and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="296.06" dur="5.4">slaughtered by by Russian back</text>
  <text start="298.7" dur="5.189">initiatives and Assad so Assad can win</text>
  <text start="301.46" dur="5.34">back some semblance of hope of restoring</text>
  <text start="303.889" dur="5.971">order in his own country or if they turn</text>
  <text start="306.8" dur="6.15">out to the north and run towards the</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="5.279">Kurdish army who is basically fighting</text>
  <text start="312.95" dur="5.99">on both sides between Turkey and Syria</text>
  <text start="315.139" dur="7.591">they&amp;#39;re gonna get wiped out by by</text>
  <text start="318.94" dur="5.41">Kurdish backed and American soldiers -</text>
  <text start="322.73" dur="2.49">probably a Special Forces that&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="324.35" dur="4.74">that&amp;#39;ll wipe them out</text>
  <text start="325.22" dur="7.17">so the ISIS the ISIS concern in the</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="5.73">region and it&amp;#39;s still there it&amp;#39;s still</text>
  <text start="332.39" dur="3.839">obviously a concern in northern Iraq -</text>
  <text start="334.82" dur="4.83">in the Mosel region but if you&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="336.229" dur="5.701">noticed what most people in the media</text>
  <text start="339.65" dur="4.2">are not reporting is that we&amp;#39;re putting</text>
  <text start="341.93" dur="3.39">them in chokehold we&amp;#39;re putting them in</text>
  <text start="343.85" dur="2.879">choke points rather I guess we only use</text>
  <text start="345.32" dur="4.5">military terminology that looks like</text>
  <text start="346.729" dur="4.891">choke points are being routed in the</text>
  <text start="349.82" dur="4.77">Middle East already and we&amp;#39;re only 60</text>
  <text start="351.62" dur="6.51">days in I can see if I you know being a</text>
  <text start="354.59" dur="5.579">non-military but government civilian I</text>
  <text start="358.13" dur="5.49">can see the strategy already taking</text>
  <text start="360.169" dur="4.741">place here and it will require I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="363.62" dur="3.09">want to say how many number of boots on</text>
  <text start="364.91" dur="3.87">the ground but it&amp;#39;ll require a fairly</text>
  <text start="366.71" dur="4.019">sizable number of American Special</text>
  <text start="368.78" dur="3.63">Forces on the ground you can&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="370.729" dur="2.871">kind of operation without having some</text>
  <text start="372.41" dur="3.39">boots on the ground</text>
  <text start="373.6" dur="3.76">absolutely because you have to make sure</text>
  <text start="375.8" dur="3.6">that your orders are carried out the</text>
  <text start="377.36" dur="5.85">directors are carried out the bodies are</text>
  <text start="379.4" dur="5.76">there the Iraqis have the bodies to do</text>
  <text start="383.21" dur="3.75">this mission with proper oversight and</text>
  <text start="385.16" dur="4.92">guidance from the military for my</text>
  <text start="386.96" dur="5.34">military and if Russia and America can</text>
  <text start="390.08" dur="4.35">agree that that&amp;#39;s the way we are going</text>
  <text start="392.3" dur="4.2">to contain Isis and that&amp;#39;s the way we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="394.43" dur="5.31">going to allow Assad to potentially hold</text>
  <text start="396.5" dur="5.52">on to his office we&amp;#39;re gonna need some</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="4.02">major reforms in Syrian government and</text>
  <text start="402.02" dur="4.05">we&amp;#39;re gonna need a fair and free</text>
  <text start="403.76" dur="5.67">election to occur that is not something</text>
  <text start="406.07" dur="4.83">that jobs with Putin but it&amp;#39;s a chance</text>
  <text start="409.43" dur="4.26">for Putin to show the world that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="410.9" dur="5.85">not dr. evil it&amp;#39;s a chance for Putin to</text>
  <text start="413.69" dur="4.86">kind of take a step forward if he wants</text>
  <text start="416.75" dur="3.569">to ease</text>
  <text start="418.55" dur="4.829">the daytime with America and if he wants</text>
  <text start="420.319" dur="5.19">to look at a legitimate reset resolving</text>
  <text start="423.379" dur="3.451">Syria has to be the first step in that</text>
  <text start="425.509" dur="3.87">product it&amp;#39;s a good chance for him to</text>
  <text start="426.83" dur="4.29">gain some credibility not not that he</text>
  <text start="429.379" dur="5.371">necessarily needs it but it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="431.12" dur="6.389">opportunity China&amp;#39;s President Xi Jinping</text>
  <text start="434.75" dur="6.199">is coming to meet with President trumpet</text>
  <text start="437.509" dur="10.021">Merrill ah go next weekend that</text>
  <text start="440.949" dur="8.891">interesting meeting like I said I&amp;#39;d love</text>
  <text start="447.53" dur="3.87">to either be a fly on the wall or an</text>
  <text start="449.84" dur="2.88">iPhone in the room because eventually</text>
  <text start="451.4" dur="2.21">those things are the same things right</text>
  <text start="452.72" dur="3.629">now</text>
  <text start="453.61" dur="4.48">and we probably know the NSA is going to</text>
  <text start="456.349" dur="8.401">be there whether they want are invited</text>
  <text start="458.09" dur="7.799">or not so you want to be the NSA</text>
  <text start="464.75" dur="5.909">operative who&amp;#39;s listening it in that</text>
  <text start="465.889" dur="10.351">conversation they&amp;#39;re probably talking</text>
  <text start="470.659" dur="6.69">about trade yeah I think I don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="476.24" dur="2.94">cut you off too much I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="477.349" dur="3.421">multi phone question there but obviously</text>
  <text start="479.18" dur="5.729">we&amp;#39;re looking at trade we&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="480.77" dur="5.61">this South South Islands the South China</text>
  <text start="484.909" dur="2.94">islands are actually yeah they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="486.38" dur="4.11">actually operative now they&amp;#39;ve gone</text>
  <text start="487.849" dur="6.151">military operative they&amp;#39;ve got some</text>
  <text start="490.49" dur="5.64">acting aircraft strips anti-aircraft</text>
  <text start="494" dur="4.229">weaponry is up and running so they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="496.13" dur="5.46">got some serious serious issues to</text>
  <text start="498.229" dur="7.41">discuss on global trade and on fair</text>
  <text start="501.59" dur="5.939">trade versus free trade and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="505.639" dur="7.01">gonna be a rather intense discussion</text>
  <text start="507.529" dur="7.8">because China loves to demand that we</text>
  <text start="512.649" dur="5.2">excise Dali Lama from any one of our</text>
  <text start="515.329" dur="5.46">political lexicons that we use Democrat</text>
  <text start="517.849" dur="6.12">or Republican they managed to get into</text>
  <text start="520.789" dur="6.391">the whole the weeds right away on the</text>
  <text start="523.969" dur="5.731">one China policy so Taiwan obviously</text>
  <text start="527.18" dur="4.83">gets very nervous every time the Chinese</text>
  <text start="529.7" dur="5.43">leaders come over here it&amp;#39;s China likes</text>
  <text start="532.01" dur="7.65">to if they perceive themselves be the</text>
  <text start="535.13" dur="7.079">masters of negotiation more so than the</text>
  <text start="539.66" dur="4.97">real master negotiator they&amp;#39;re about to</text>
  <text start="542.209" dur="4.651">fight well you know I tell you what</text>
  <text start="544.63" dur="4.48">Trump has mentioned several times</text>
  <text start="546.86" dur="3.87">on the campaign trail is that he has</text>
  <text start="549.11" dur="3.45">negotiated the deals in China he has</text>
  <text start="550.73" dur="4.229">respected China&amp;#39;s ability</text>
  <text start="552.56" dur="4.92">she he likes the way they think because</text>
  <text start="554.959" dur="6.12">he thinks in similar terms so I think</text>
  <text start="557.48" dur="5.909">China understands certain complexities</text>
  <text start="561.079" dur="4.67">of Donald Trump&amp;#39;s business instincts</text>
  <text start="563.389" dur="4.651">they have failed to garner that</text>
  <text start="565.749" dur="4.39">transcendence over to the political</text>
  <text start="568.04" dur="6.599">realm that Donald Trump has so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="570.139" dur="9.12">going to come over and seek a I would</text>
  <text start="574.639" dur="6.42">say an unfairly or imbalanced slate of</text>
  <text start="579.259" dur="3.99">agreements from us because they they</text>
  <text start="581.059" dur="4.65">think by reading American media that</text>
  <text start="583.249" dur="4.051">Trump is under siege they&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="585.709" dur="3.99">read the Gallup polls they&amp;#39;re gonna read</text>
  <text start="587.3" dur="4.709">the the MSM reports of the day and say</text>
  <text start="589.699" dur="4.521">hey listen mr. president you&amp;#39;re in no</text>
  <text start="592.009" dur="5.611">position to to force us to do anything</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="6.19">you don&amp;#39;t even have a pure hold on your</text>
  <text start="597.62" dur="5.79">own people which China really abhors the</text>
  <text start="600.41" dur="4.289">thought of having a 37 percent approval</text>
  <text start="603.41" dur="2.969">rating in their country they would never</text>
  <text start="604.699" dur="3.87">allow it because they would that would</text>
  <text start="606.379" dur="4.411">essentially mean that they have to wipe</text>
  <text start="608.569" dur="3.51">out sixty-three percent of their own</text>
  <text start="610.79" dur="4.589">people in order to get their approval</text>
  <text start="612.079" dur="5.94">readies back up so China will definitely</text>
  <text start="615.379" dur="4.531">seek to use this time of political</text>
  <text start="618.019" dur="3.51">turmoil to their own advantage but it</text>
  <text start="619.91" dur="4.529">won&amp;#39;t it won&amp;#39;t necessarily fly with</text>
  <text start="621.529" dur="5.67">chomp it probably won&amp;#39;t I mean yeah like</text>
  <text start="624.439" dur="4.741">you said the president during the</text>

  <text start="908.11" dur="4.68">not being turned over to ice that&amp;#39;s just</text>

  <text start="912.79" dur="3.51">that George Soros would put all that</text>

  <text start="918.52" dur="6.57">him all he wants but they&amp;#39;re short-lived</text>

  <text start="925.09" dur="4.83">the day we are we are rounding up</text>
  <text start="927.75" dur="4.09">sheriffs like this they&amp;#39;ve started in</text>
  <text start="929.92" dur="4.62">Texas with a bill that&amp;#39;s moving down</text>
  <text start="931.84" dur="4.92">there that will allow the incarceration</text>

  <text start="936.76" dur="4.44">officers who are willingly defying the</text>
  <text start="938.89" dur="4.71">law of the land so we&amp;#39;re you know the</text>
  <text start="941.2" dur="5.82">federal the federal law enforcement arm</text>
  <text start="943.6" dur="6.11">it&amp;#39;s not only long it is strong it has a</text>
  <text start="947.02" dur="5.76">ton of doctrine and judicially approved</text>
  <text start="949.71" dur="5.02">methods behind it so there&amp;#39;s no winnable</text>
  <text start="952.78" dur="4.23">scenario here for these people it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="954.73" dur="5.159">it&amp;#39;s all a short-lived news cycle game</text>
  <text start="957.01" dur="4.35">for them and someone&amp;#39;s gonna get raped</text>
  <text start="959.889" dur="3.901">someone&amp;#39;s gonna get robbed someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="961.36" dur="4.95">gonna get killed because of these</text>
  <text start="963.79" dur="4.53">actions I think that this Sheriff and</text>
  <text start="966.31" dur="6.36">other sheriffs like this need to be held</text>
  <text start="968.32" dur="7.379">morally civilly criminally responsible</text>
  <text start="972.67" dur="5.25">for those things that happen I agree</text>
  <text start="975.699" dur="4.651">with you so moving on</text>
  <text start="977.92" dur="5.01">because we&amp;#39;re kind of short on time</text>
  <text start="980.35" dur="4.859">judge Gorsuch is going to be up for a</text>
  <text start="982.93" dur="8.099">vote in this coming week it looks like</text>
  <text start="985.209" dur="9.18">and we&amp;#39;ve got two Democratic operatives</text>
  <text start="991.029" dur="5.281">now who we know mansion and who is the</text>
  <text start="994.389" dur="4.591">other one from north to North Dakota who</text>
  <text start="996.31" dur="5.87">said yeah I guess I kept like they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="998.98" dur="5.34">both going to be on board with Gorsuch</text>
  <text start="1002.18" dur="8.14">so that we don&amp;#39;t have to do the nuclear</text>
  <text start="1004.32" dur="7.769">option hopefully yeah and yeah can you</text>
  <text start="1010.32" dur="3.15">briefly I mean you know what how about</text>
  <text start="1012.089" dur="4.891">if I briefly explain the nuclear option</text>
  <text start="1013.47" dur="6.869">and you can you can give me a grade so</text>
  <text start="1016.98" dur="8.03">in in years past in order to approve</text>
  <text start="1020.339" dur="8.041">judges there has typically been a</text>
  <text start="1025.01" dur="7.569">necessary 60% vote in order to approve</text>
  <text start="1028.38" dur="5.189">and some time ago when Democrats thought</text>
  <text start="1032.579" dur="5.911">they were going to remain in power</text>
  <text start="1033.569" dur="6.39">forever under the leadership they</text>
  <text start="1038.49" dur="5.91">decided to change the rules for</text>
  <text start="1039.959" dur="7.681">approving judges and they essentially</text>
  <text start="1044.4" dur="6.36">approved a simple majority to approve a</text>
  <text start="1047.64" dur="5.1">judge and that did not go through for</text>
  <text start="1050.76" dur="5.58">Supreme Court justices just federal</text>
  <text start="1052.74" dur="6.35">judges I understand and now we&amp;#39;re facing</text>
  <text start="1056.34" dur="6.75">the possibility of we&amp;#39;re getting rid of</text>
  <text start="1059.09" dur="5.56">that super majority vote and now using a</text>
  <text start="1063.09" dur="4.29">simple majority for Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="1064.65" dur="4.92">justices which is a risky thing because</text>
  <text start="1067.38" dur="4.41">we&amp;#39;re it&amp;#39;s a change of Senate rules and</text>
  <text start="1069.57" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s called the nuclear option if we</text>
  <text start="1071.79" dur="3.269">decide to suspend those rules change</text>
  <text start="1073.98" dur="3.449">them and now just make it a simple</text>
  <text start="1075.059" dur="4.891">majority then we just do an up or down</text>
  <text start="1077.429" dur="5.571">vote is that a decent explanation of</text>
  <text start="1079.95" dur="6.15">what it what we&amp;#39;re looking at yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="1083" dur="4.75">essentially we you know ran into a lot</text>
  <text start="1086.1" dur="5.04">loggerheads over</text>
  <text start="1087.75" dur="4.8">some recess appointments that Obama</text>
  <text start="1091.14" dur="2.94">attempted to do a couple years ago that</text>
  <text start="1092.55" dur="2.91">did not work out they were struck down</text>
  <text start="1094.08" dur="2.76">by federal judges it would have been</text>
  <text start="1095.46" dur="4.44">struck down by the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="1096.84" dur="4.47">so in frustration the the supposed gang</text>
  <text start="1099.9" dur="3.75">of eight over there got together in</text>
  <text start="1101.31" dur="3.27">order to save the new killer option they</text>
  <text start="1103.65" dur="4.86">tried to work out a deal</text>
  <text start="1104.58" dur="6.81">and essentially the deal was that they</text>
  <text start="1108.51" dur="5.34">would do just federal judges and leave</text>
  <text start="1111.39" dur="5.67">the Supreme Court nuclear option alone</text>
  <text start="1113.85" dur="5.31">and a lot of Democrats were upset that</text>
  <text start="1117.06" dur="4.71">Harry Reid went ahead with that deal but</text>
  <text start="1119.16" dur="4.68">they got they got a substantial number</text>
  <text start="1121.77" dur="4.02">of federal judges on the bench that are</text>
  <text start="1123.84" dur="3.96">now causing the very same headaches that</text>
  <text start="1125.79" dur="5.22">we&amp;#39;re dealing with right now on the</text>
  <text start="1127.8" dur="5.82">executive order so it was a win at the</text>
  <text start="1131.01" dur="5.79">time but however now we are reloading</text>
  <text start="1133.62" dur="6.24">and we&amp;#39;re gonna fire off about 90 some</text>
  <text start="1136.8" dur="5.04">judges on the federal bench of our own</text>
  <text start="1139.86" dur="3.24">with simple majority which is helpful we</text>
  <text start="1141.84" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t have to go through the rigmarole</text>
  <text start="1143.1" dur="4.62">of trying to get 60 for each one of</text>
  <text start="1145.26" dur="4.35">these so where our list is almost</text>
  <text start="1147.72" dur="3.57">complete we&amp;#39;ll be moving forward with</text>
  <text start="1149.61" dur="5.34">those federal judges as soon as Korsak</text>
  <text start="1151.29" dur="6.18">is done so yes so now the real tricky</text>
  <text start="1154.95" dur="5.46">part for the Democrats is their map is</text>
  <text start="1157.47" dur="5.31">almost unwinnable in the Senate in 2018</text>
  <text start="1160.41" dur="5.31">they&amp;#39;ve got ten Democrats currently</text>
  <text start="1162.78" dur="5.79">residing in red states that Trump won it</text>
  <text start="1165.72" dur="5.64">would be mathematically impossible for</text>
  <text start="1168.57" dur="6.36">them to actually hold on to all of those</text>
  <text start="1171.36" dur="6.12">nevermind win those and then additional</text>
  <text start="1174.93" dur="5.58">seats in order to get back in a majority</text>
  <text start="1177.48" dur="5.28">so the risk they&amp;#39;re taking here by</text>
  <text start="1180.51" dur="4.05">pushing Gorsuch all the way up to a four</text>
  <text start="1182.76" dur="4.29">a nuclear option would be again people</text>
  <text start="1184.56" dur="4.44">have to understand once we are once we</text>
  <text start="1187.05" dur="4.23">eradicate this option it&amp;#39;s gone for good</text>
  <text start="1189" dur="5.01">so if you look at Neal corsets he</text>
  <text start="1191.28" dur="6.36">appears to be what he really is and that</text>
  <text start="1194.01" dur="6.42">is a great judge and an easy pick and</text>
  <text start="1197.64" dur="4.32">and if saw DeMaio and Kagan got a simple</text>
  <text start="1200.43" dur="4.11">up-or-down vote how the heck can you</text>
  <text start="1201.96" dur="4.41">justify attempting to filibuster Neel</text>
  <text start="1204.54" dur="3.93">gorsek so we won&amp;#39;t go over well with the</text>
  <text start="1206.37" dur="4.38">public that they do this and the</text>
  <text start="1208.47" dur="4.32">Democrats will probably will probably</text>

  <text start="1225.99" dur="5.819">he&amp;#39;s willing to vote no on on gorsek</text>

  <text start="1243.299" dur="4.891">standing against Korsak will be a very</text>

  <text start="2037.03" dur="2.94">gonna have to come out of the house no</text>
  <text start="2038.38" dur="3.96">matter what but the Senate just</text>
  <text start="2039.97" dur="4.17">dilly-dally and the Senate needs to</text>

  <text start="2060.94" dur="4.95">in there overrule the parliamentarian we</text>
  <text start="2063.82" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t need the reconciliation aspects of</text>

  <text start="2068.5" dur="4.62">have something that is functional to</text>
  <text start="2071.02" dur="3.81">replace it with that goes into effect</text>
  <text start="2073.12" dur="3.809">immediately so that we don&amp;#39;t knock off</text>
  <text start="2074.83" dur="4.74">twenty million people off of coverage in</text>
  <text start="2076.929" dur="6.601">one single shot the question is you know</text>
  <text start="2079.57" dur="7.02">if you need to repair a skyscraper David</text>
  <text start="2083.53" dur="7.02">you know are you going to start that</text>
  <text start="2086.59" dur="6.54">repair on the 75th floor or are you</text>
  <text start="2090.55" dur="4.92">going to get to the base of the building</text>
  <text start="2093.13" dur="3.99">and do what you have to do to repair it</text>
  <text start="2095.47" dur="3.36">or are you going to knock the damn thing</text>
  <text start="2097.12" dur="4.29">down and build it back up as quickly as</text>
  <text start="2098.83" dur="3.15">you can either way of those three</text>
  <text start="2101.41" dur="2.19">options</text>
  <text start="2101.98" dur="5.22">I think the silliest thing to do is to</text>
  <text start="2103.6" dur="6.24">climb atop the tower and try to work</text>
  <text start="2107.2" dur="4.86">your way down and fix it that way and</text>
  <text start="2109.84" dur="3.75">that&amp;#39;s exactly what Ryan Kerr was you</text>
  <text start="2112.06" dur="4.11">know that was climbing your way up on</text>
  <text start="2113.59" dur="4.98">this heaping pile of crap this building</text>
  <text start="2116.17" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s ready collapsed and try to fix it</text>
  <text start="2118.57" dur="3.9">from the 75th floor and and I thought</text>
  <text start="2121.03" dur="3.69">that&amp;#39;s that just doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="2122.47" dur="4.2">to me right so politically politically</text>
  <text start="2124.72" dur="2.55">and policy-wise it was the wrong</text>
  <text start="2126.67" dur="4.53">decision</text>
  <text start="2127.27" dur="5.82">so either build a new building or go to</text>
  <text start="2131.2" dur="3.66">the base of the building and do what you</text>
  <text start="2133.09" dur="4.14">have to do and work it work work of the</text>
  <text start="2134.86" dur="5.43">way up on that function but you cannot</text>
  <text start="2137.23" dur="5.19">do what Ryan wanted to do because you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2140.29" dur="4.62">still driving premium cost up which they</text>
  <text start="2142.42" dur="5.31">acknowledge your premiums would still go</text>

  <text start="2147.73" dur="3.84">are still going to be sky-high and p20</text>
  <text start="2150.25" dur="3.57">million people are still gonna lose</text>
  <text start="2151.57" dur="4.41">coverage after a couple of years so I</text>
  <text start="2153.82" dur="4.41">ask of you I beg of you where is the</text>
  <text start="2155.98" dur="4.86">political expediency</text>
  <text start="2158.23" dur="5.01">what&amp;#39;s the necessity to do that other</text>
  <text start="2160.84" dur="5.94">than to say that you you know did</text>
  <text start="2163.24" dur="5.58">something to repair the ACA so if if</text>
  <text start="2166.78" dur="4.05">you&amp;#39;re a long time or lifer like me</text>

  <text start="2283.9" dur="3.66">in the Eisenhower building and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2285.25" dur="3.96">where Nunez went to to visit this they</text>
  <text start="2287.56" dur="3.33">went to the secret room where you visit</text>
  <text start="2289.21" dur="2.52">when you want to look at intelligence</text>
  <text start="2290.89" dur="3.24">that</text>
  <text start="2291.73" dur="4.47">sensitive to be seen outside the room so</text>
  <text start="2294.13" dur="3.63">people knew this the question about why</text>
  <text start="2296.2" dur="3.419">Nunez went to the White House and all</text>
  <text start="2297.76" dur="4.89">this other stuff junk like that so</text>

  <text start="2604.15" dur="4.68">manna Fork to come forward and testify</text>
  <text start="2606" dur="4.15">well they thought about asking manna for</text>
  <text start="2608.83" dur="2.52">it until they started to find out some</text>
  <text start="2610.15" dur="4.98">information and then they backed off</text>
  <text start="2611.35" dur="4.47">that like it was a house on fire so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2615.13" dur="2.82">kind of funny</text>
  <text start="2615.82" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s all self preservation here for the</text>

  <text start="2626.8" dur="4.5">complicit to give them cover but if you</text>
  <text start="2629.53" dur="3.57">take the media out of it and just look</text>
  <text start="2631.3" dur="3.96">at what the Democrats have tried to do</text>
  <text start="2633.1" dur="3.96">you can see them running into brick</text>
  <text start="2635.26" dur="3.57">walls left and right and it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="2637.06" dur="4.71">hilarious but if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re Mike</text>
  <text start="2638.83" dur="4.5">Flynn and you want to you want to get</text>
  <text start="2641.77" dur="4.77">your story out there but no one&amp;#39;s asking</text>
  <text start="2643.33" dur="4.5">you to do it you you put it you have</text>
  <text start="2646.54" dur="3.93">your lawyer put out a statement saying</text>
  <text start="2647.83" dur="4.02">I&amp;#39;ll agree to testify before the House</text>
  <text start="2650.47" dur="4.53">or Senate committees provided I have</text>
  <text start="2651.85" dur="5.82">immunity well that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a little bit</text>
  <text start="2655" dur="5.28">of blood in the water for the sharks</text>
  <text start="2657.67" dur="6.51">isn&amp;#39;t it right immunity immunity from</text>
  <text start="2660.28" dur="6.81">what we&amp;#39;ve defy maybe there&amp;#39;s some dirt</text>
  <text start="2664.18" dur="5.94">so you don&amp;#39;t have to and your listeners</text>
  <text start="2667.09" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t have to necessarily believe me you</text>
  <text start="2670.12" dur="4.56">know my success versus failure rate on</text>
  <text start="2672.37" dur="4.14">my deductions on intelligence you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2674.68" dur="10.95">another thing notches below Julian</text>
  <text start="2676.51" dur="11.76">Assange yeah I would say that without</text>
  <text start="2685.63" dur="5.22">being too silly about it I I do want to</text>
  <text start="2688.27" dur="4.23">say that that General Michael Flynn as</text>
  <text start="2690.85" dur="6.35">his character has never</text>
  <text start="2692.5" dur="9.15">truly been put under a negative</text>
  <text start="2697.2" dur="8.74">microscope and never found to be in any</text>
  <text start="2701.65" dur="7.17">way culpable for or even possible of any</text>
  <text start="2705.94" dur="5.34">you know misdeeds or or anything like</text>
  <text start="2708.82" dur="4.77">that so I would be very surprised if he</text>
  <text start="2711.28" dur="4.5">had much that needed immunity from</text>
  <text start="2713.59" dur="4.53">however remember he did in fact work</text>
  <text start="2715.78" dur="5.34">under the Obama administration he was in</text>
  <text start="2718.12" dur="5.58">fact party to not party to but privy to</text>
  <text start="2721.12" dur="5.04">information that could be very sensitive</text>
  <text start="2723.7" dur="3.51">to the Benghazi operation that went to</text>
  <text start="2726.16" dur="3.42">hell in a handbasket</text>
  <text start="2727.21" dur="4.56">so remember one year in front of that</text>
  <text start="2729.58" dur="4.26">committee they can ask you any question</text>
  <text start="2731.77" dur="3.66">and I would I certainly would want</text>
  <text start="2733.84" dur="5.58">immunity to but isn&amp;#39;t it funny to</text>
  <text start="2735.43" dur="5.58">preemptively offer to testify one no one</text>
  <text start="2739.42" dur="4.65">on either side of the aisle has asked</text>
  <text start="2741.01" dur="4.68">you to and then you put the the added</text>

  <text start="2745.69" dur="2.37">immunity first I thought it was</text>

  <text start="2748.06" dur="5.1">it&amp;#39;s set Washington abuzz David my gosh</text>
  <text start="2750.34" dur="4.29">exactly as it was supposed to right but</text>
  <text start="2753.16" dur="5.76">let&amp;#39;s all keep some perspective here</text>
  <text start="2754.63" dur="7.44">about that right so I&amp;#39;ve got two more</text>
  <text start="2758.92" dur="6.18">questions I want to ask you about and</text>
  <text start="2762.07" dur="5.88">have you seen the video that Serna Mitch</text>

  <text start="2832.17" dur="7.77">10 years every platform that we show up</text>
  <text start="2836.25" dur="6.51">on we get a footprint we start to make</text>
  <text start="2839.94" dur="6.24">an impact we get our voice out there and</text>
  <text start="2842.76" dur="5.43">then they come and attack us they have</text>

  <text start="3197.33" dur="6.49">definitely a theatrical figure from</text>

  <text start="3203.82" dur="3.72">to do what he does and that turned some</text>
  <text start="3206.22" dur="3.54">people off and it also brings some</text>
  <text start="3207.54" dur="6.329">people to the table I of course don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3209.76" dur="6.45">have the same bravado or machismo or</text>

  <text start="3265.05" dur="4.799">things just keep coming down the line</text>
  <text start="3267.15" dur="4.469">for you and and we have certain people</text>
  <text start="3269.849" dur="3.27">that look to us for information David</text>
  <text start="3271.619" dur="4.641">and then I know that you feel</text>
  <text start="3273.119" dur="6.721">responsibility I feel responsibility and</text>

  <text start="3290.04" dur="4.74">ever talked about and all of our</text>
  <text start="3291.3" dur="5.13">conversations we simply just want to get</text>
  <text start="3294.78" dur="4.02">our message to the people that want to</text>
  <text start="3296.43" dur="4.71">hear it and does that take some money</text>
  <text start="3298.8" dur="5.37">yes it does take your money to get your</text>
  <text start="3301.14" dur="6.63">message out but making a profit off of</text>

  <text start="4090.54" dur="3.75">something where it&amp;#39;s it was something</text>
  <text start="4092.67" dur="3.42">that I you know after the election we</text>
  <text start="4094.29" dur="3.75">knew that we&amp;#39;d wait from November 8th -</text>
  <text start="4096.09" dur="4.23">January 20th before something would</text>
  <text start="4098.04" dur="4.74">happen as far as you know potential job</text>
  <text start="4100.32" dur="4.38">opportunities in DC and and over that</text>
  <text start="4102.78" dur="3">time things we you know are gonna be a</text>
  <text start="4104.7" dur="2.61">little tough and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="4105.78" dur="2.94">you wake up to the reality that you</text>
  <text start="4107.31" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t want to go to DC and be away from</text>
  <text start="4108.72" dur="5.31">your two very small daughters and and</text>
  <text start="4112.02" dur="4.5">then that starts to dawn on your like a</text>
  <text start="4114.03" dur="4.8">like a reality and then all of a sudden</text>
  <text start="4116.52" dur="3.57">you realize that wait a minute wait what</text>
  <text start="4118.83" dur="2.58">is it that you want to do because if you</text>
  <text start="4120.09" dur="4.38">do go back to what you were doing before</text>
  <text start="4121.41" dur="5.01">and consulting and doing campaigns and</text>
  <text start="4124.47" dur="3.18">doing work for other people you won&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="4126.42" dur="3.24">able to say what you feel</text>
  <text start="4127.65" dur="3.51">anymore about what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="4129.66" dur="3.24">politically because other people are the</text>
  <text start="4131.16" dur="3.36">source of your income therefore that</text>
  <text start="4132.9" dur="3.54">they will be controlling the source of</text>
  <text start="4134.52" dur="4.44">right what you say and you they dicto</text>
  <text start="4136.44" dur="4.38">narrative and that&amp;#39;s exactly and that</text>
  <text start="4138.96" dur="4.29">was what you said about Trump is Trump</text>
  <text start="4140.82" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t have any big donors that is not</text>
  <text start="4143.25" dur="4.65">beholden to anybody he can go into that</text>
  <text start="4145.14" dur="4.29">office say what is on his mind do what</text>
  <text start="4147.9" dur="2.91">he wants to do it doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry</text>
  <text start="4149.43" dur="3.69">about somebody else pulling the strings</text>
  <text start="4150.81" dur="4.56">and that&amp;#39;s the difficult thing about</text>
  <text start="4153.12" dur="4.83">politics to get into politics and have</text>
  <text start="4155.37" dur="4.62">that freedom almost no one is able to do</text>
  <text start="4157.95" dur="4.56">that and I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="4159.99" dur="3.66">throw that away lightly so that&amp;#39;s why he</text>
  <text start="4162.51" dur="2.94">still has</text>
  <text start="4163.65" dur="3.39">more political capital with the people</text>
  <text start="4165.45" dur="5.04">that voted for him than he does in the</text>
  <text start="4167.04" dur="4.92">you know it so mysterious people yeah</text>
  <text start="4170.49" dur="2.91">the people were the people but you know</text>
  <text start="4171.96" dur="4.23">and I also have to give you credit I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4173.4" dur="5.79">given you credit directly um you know in</text>
  <text start="4176.19" dur="4.17">our messages before where there were</text>
  <text start="4179.19" dur="3.93">times where I wasn&amp;#39;t a hundred percent</text>
  <text start="4180.36" dur="4.77">sure what I I knew was going to happen</text>
  <text start="4183.12" dur="3.42">and I was a little hesitant to put</text>
  <text start="4185.13" dur="3.3">myself too far out there because I</text>
  <text start="4186.54" dur="5.61">didn&amp;#39;t want to be another one of these</text>
  <text start="4188.43" dur="4.86">weatherman media guys who just said</text>
  <text start="4192.15" dur="3.93">something&amp;#39;s going to happen it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4193.29" dur="4.8">happen and then I remember it was a it</text>
  <text start="4196.08" dur="3.81">was when the deep state type of</text>
  <text start="4198.09" dur="3.99">terminology and the war started to</text>
  <text start="4199.89" dur="3.72">bubble to the surface and Bill Mitchell</text>
  <text start="4202.08" dur="3.39">made a call and just said hey I need you</text>
  <text start="4203.61" dur="5.19">to come on for the second night in a row</text>
  <text start="4205.47" dur="4.38">because it&amp;#39;s got such big views I would</text>
  <text start="4208.8" dur="4.53">like you to come on and talk more about</text>
  <text start="4209.85" dur="5.22">it and I think I got a direct message</text>
  <text start="4213.33" dur="5.1">from you that day about something that</text>
  <text start="4215.07" dur="6.36">you had a dream about and it gave me the</text>
  <text start="4218.43" dur="6">courage to to talk a little bit more</text>
  <text start="4221.43" dur="6.45">about what I saw happening in my own</text>
  <text start="4224.43" dur="4.17">mind through deduction about what was</text>
  <text start="4227.88" dur="3.03">going to happen with some of the</text>
  <text start="4228.6" dur="5.16">intelligent stuff and therefore because</text>
  <text start="4230.91" dur="4.92">of your influence directly I went and</text>
  <text start="4233.76" dur="4.62">and gave some pretty intense dialogue</text>
  <text start="4235.83" dur="4.92">with Bill back and forth about this and</text>
  <text start="4238.38" dur="5.79">ended up predicting that the deep state</text>
  <text start="4240.75" dur="4.95">itself would turn to Julian Assange and</text>
  <text start="4244.17" dur="3">WikiLeaks as the ultimate Clearing House</text>
  <text start="4245.7" dur="3.48">that he would receive all of the</text>
  <text start="4247.17" dur="3.57">information that could be mutually</text>
  <text start="4249.18" dur="4.5">assured destruction for both sides and</text>
  <text start="4250.74" dur="5.43">then you know about 16 days later or</text>
  <text start="4253.68" dur="4.26">less than is when vault 7 was announced</text>
  <text start="4256.17" dur="4.32">and that was essentially what had</text>
  <text start="4257.94" dur="5.73">happened and that&amp;#39;s when you know you</text>
  <text start="4260.49" dur="4.71">have to have faith in yourself but there</text>
  <text start="4263.67" dur="3.36">are some of us who are always going to</text>
  <text start="4265.2" dur="3.93">require faith from others in order to</text>
  <text start="4267.03" dur="5.73">fully actualize the faith in ourselves</text>
  <text start="4269.13" dur="5.64">so no man is an island in this business</text>
  <text start="4272.76" dur="5.91">so I needed that push that shove from</text>
  <text start="4274.77" dur="6.39">you which pushed bill Mitchell show into</text>
  <text start="4278.67" dur="4.5">a new level our viewers went up my</text>
  <text start="4281.16" dur="4.59">appearances are getting more views now</text>
  <text start="4283.17" dur="5.1">and now Donald Trump is taking an</text>
  <text start="4285.75" dur="4.17">extraordinary step of retreating bill</text>
  <text start="4288.27" dur="7.64">Mitchell which is uh</text>
  <text start="4289.92" dur="7.349">you rarely ever rarely retweets anybody</text>
  <text start="4295.91" dur="3.189">you know</text>
  <text start="4297.269" dur="3.9">all happening and Bill had Sebastian</text>
  <text start="4299.099" dur="5.43">Gurkha on the show today yeah it was</text>
  <text start="4301.169" dur="5.61">great interview it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s all happening</text>
  <text start="4304.529" dur="4.59">and it&amp;#39;s happening incremental it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4306.779" dur="5.4">happening as it should not all at one</text>
  <text start="4309.119" dur="5.52">time but if you don&amp;#39;t have faith if you</text>
  <text start="4312.179" dur="4.081">know what faith and the people that have</text>
  <text start="4314.639" dur="3.9">faith in you you can&amp;#39;t have faith in</text>
  <text start="4316.26" dur="4.739">yourself so I certainly wasn&amp;#39;t doing</text>
  <text start="4318.539" dur="4.55">myself any justice by holding back right</text>
  <text start="4320.999" dur="5.1">what I knew in my heart was probably</text>
  <text start="4323.089" dur="6.22">decent decent perspective and analysis</text>
  <text start="4326.099" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;ve sensed I&amp;#39;ve since just gone with it</text>
  <text start="4329.309" dur="3.33">so to speak</text>
  <text start="4330.689" dur="4.35">knowing that there&amp;#39;s a larger sense of</text>
  <text start="4332.639" dur="2.67">purpose here and and I&amp;#39;m riding that</text>
  <text start="4335.039" dur="2.43">wave</text>
  <text start="4335.309" dur="6.09">I&amp;#39;m literally letting the tide take care</text>
  <text start="4337.469" dur="5.61">of me and and hoping that things are</text>
  <text start="4341.399" dur="3.75">going to work out just enough that I can</text>
  <text start="4343.079" dur="5.61">at least provide for my family in the</text>
  <text start="4345.149" dur="5.52">way that I once did and ya know time</text>
  <text start="4348.689" dur="4.11">time is the talk that the clock is</text>
  <text start="4350.669" dur="3.72">ticking so to speak but things are</text>
  <text start="4352.799" dur="3.961">moving in the right direction is all I</text>
  <text start="4354.389" dur="5.81">can say and I don&amp;#39;t feel any frustration</text>
  <text start="4356.76" dur="6.509">in the relationships that I&amp;#39;m building</text>
  <text start="4360.199" dur="4.57">through through a lot of people come to</text>
  <text start="4363.269" dur="4.59">me through you a lot of people come to</text>
  <text start="4364.769" dur="5.79">me through Bill Mitchell Jackie O so Vic</text>

  <text start="4370.559" dur="4.89">growing only stronger not not weaker</text>
  <text start="4373.469" dur="2.49">it&amp;#39;s going to grow stronger and here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4375.449" dur="3.09">why</text>
  <text start="4375.959" dur="7.62">what you may or may not realize this</text>
  <text start="4378.539" dur="8.37">Adam but we have never seen a</text>
  <text start="4383.579" dur="6.84">post-election cycle like we&amp;#39;ve seen this</text>
  <text start="4386.909" dur="5.04">year mm-hmm I was anticipating I was</text>
  <text start="4390.419" dur="3.78">kind of expecting in the lead-up to the</text>
  <text start="4391.949" dur="4.86">election man what are we gonna do after</text>
  <text start="4394.199" dur="3.83">the elections done you know what what is</text>

  <text start="4398.029" dur="4.42">what because after the election</text>
  <text start="4400.739" dur="5.19">everything kind of dies down back to</text>
  <text start="4402.449" dur="5.73">business as usual you know yeah but no</text>
  <text start="4405.929" dur="4.59">one I don&amp;#39;t think really anticipated</text>
  <text start="4408.179" dur="4.74">that the media was going to attack Trump</text>
  <text start="4410.519" dur="4.23">the way they did continue to attack him</text>
  <text start="4412.919" dur="4.05">after he won the election all the</text>
  <text start="4414.749" dur="4.47">protests and the riots and all of the</text>
  <text start="4416.969" dur="4.62">the the hacking the Russian hacking</text>

  <text start="4423.269" dur="5.67">election is done no one really expected</text>
  <text start="4425.969" dur="5.131">that to happen and because the</text>
  <text start="4428.939" dur="3.781">mainstream media decided we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="4431.1" dur="4.05">and we&amp;#39;re not were just beginning with</text>
  <text start="4432.72" dur="6.81">Trump we&amp;#39;re gonna keep going until he is</text>

  <text start="4449.64" dur="3.93">here&amp;#39;s what my sources are saying this</text>
  <text start="4451.62" dur="6.02">is why we need to stay on top of this</text>
  <text start="4453.57" dur="8.04">stuff you were you all of a sudden your</text>
  <text start="4457.64" dur="5.35">expertise became not just that lead up</text>
  <text start="4461.61" dur="4.08">to the election but now we need a</text>

  <text start="4505.59" dur="5.55">position to speak openly and</text>
  <text start="4507.18" dur="6.3">transparently about what you know well</text>
  <text start="4511.14" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s true and I you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4513.48" dur="4.2">blessed I&amp;#39;m humbled all the time by this</text>

  <text start="4517.68" dur="5.64">trading off part of my future</text>
  <text start="4519.63" dur="7.32">capabilities and options and avenues by</text>
  <text start="4523.32" dur="6.15">by being in this moment you tend to lose</text>
  <text start="4526.95" dur="4.62">some of your respect for the old-school</text>
  <text start="4529.47" dur="5.22">way of the way you lived your life</text>
  <text start="4531.57" dur="5.01">before you cut deals you you trade off</text>
  <text start="4534.69" dur="3.96">what you needed to trade off in order to</text>
  <text start="4536.58" dur="4.23">get promoted or you know get the next</text>
  <text start="4538.65" dur="5.13">thing you want and now you start to wake</text>
  <text start="4540.81" dur="3.57">up it&amp;#39;s almost like religious awakening</text>
  <text start="4543.78" dur="3.51">of sorts</text>
  <text start="4544.38" dur="5.97">knowing how flawed your your logic was</text>
  <text start="4547.29" dur="4.92">and how flawed you were in becoming just</text>
  <text start="4550.35" dur="5.22">another cog in the wheel of the machine</text>
  <text start="4552.21" dur="5.88">that went in every way it was just going</text>
  <text start="4555.57" dur="6.48">for its own purposes so so this this</text>
  <text start="4558.09" dur="6.8">Awakening has been drastic but it&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="4562.05" dur="2.84">been very</text>

  <text start="5094.099" dur="5.191">particularly with my connection with</text>
  <text start="5095.78" dur="5.82">Drew bill that platform is growing</text>

  <text start="5125.68" dur="5.8">through that platform as my website</text>
  <text start="5127.88" dur="5.43">grows I would like to diversify with</text>
  <text start="5131.48" dur="3.78">with personalities such as yourself</text>
  <text start="5133.31" dur="5.22">because I do actually have a very small</text>
  <text start="5135.26" dur="4.8">circle of people that I work with on on</text>
