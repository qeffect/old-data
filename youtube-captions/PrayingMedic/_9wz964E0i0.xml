  <text start="183.16" dur="5.43">the dream I kept seeing these lists and</text>
  <text start="187.09" dur="5.79">lists of people who are being arrested</text>
  <text start="188.59" dur="8.01">now here is what my observation about</text>
  <text start="192.88" dur="6.06">this whole takedown of corruption and</text>
  <text start="196.6" dur="4.109">government is I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="198.94" dur="2.91">to see a lot of this on the mainstream</text>
  <text start="200.709" dur="6.391">media I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="201.85" dur="6.99">it reported I think that a lot of it is</text>
  <text start="207.1" dur="5.82">going to go unreported by the mainstream</text>
  <text start="208.84" dur="6.84">media and cue and the people in the</text>
  <text start="212.92" dur="4.7">intelligence circles who are dropping</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="4.2">information to people like Brendan dilly</text>
  <text start="217.62" dur="4.63">they&amp;#39;re going to be the ones who are</text>
  <text start="219.88" dur="3.78">telling us what is going on because the</text>
  <text start="222.25" dur="4.17">mainstream media won&amp;#39;t report on a lot</text>
  <text start="223.66" dur="4.38">of this but I don&amp;#39;t think it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="3.27">going to be an embarrassment to the</text>
  <text start="228.04" dur="6.169">mainstream media look the the mainstream</text>
  <text start="229.69" dur="7.32">media is complicit in this corruption a</text>
  <text start="234.209" dur="8.051">lot of reporters have been paid by the</text>
  <text start="237.01" dur="6.99">deep state they are they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="242.26" dur="3.27">nothing more than propaganda outlets for</text>
  <text start="244" dur="4.41">the deep state for the corruption and</text>
  <text start="245.53" dur="4.56">they&amp;#39;re going to be taken down they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="248.41" dur="3.63">going to be exposed a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="250.09" dur="3.149">going to be arrested there&amp;#39;s people in</text>
  <text start="252.04" dur="5.28">high places in the media that already</text>
  <text start="253.239" dur="5.641">resigning so is it in their best</text>
  <text start="257.32" dur="3.419">interest to report on all this</text>
  <text start="258.88" dur="4.11">corruption probably not how are we going</text>

  <text start="355.69" dur="7.95">the special counsel with respect and a</text>
  <text start="360.12" dur="5.65">sense of honor and dignity if you want</text>
  <text start="363.64" dur="5.01">to be appointed special counsel you</text>
  <text start="365.77" dur="6.33">can&amp;#39;t talk crap about another special</text>

  <text start="391.33" dur="3.87">them thinking you&amp;#39;re some partisan hack</text>

  <text start="473.5" dur="7.5">observations about the Pfizer memo I did</text>
  <text start="476.349" dur="7.35">a two hour broadcast last night on it</text>
  <text start="481" dur="4.409">was supposed to be on my latest Q update</text>
  <text start="483.699" dur="3.75">and then I did a question and answer</text>
  <text start="485.409" dur="5.551">afterward which ended up being about an</text>
  <text start="487.449" dur="6">hour and 15 minutes of questions and</text>
  <text start="490.96" dur="4.259">answers about Q but a lot of it ended up</text>
  <text start="493.449" dur="3.69">by talking about the Department of</text>
  <text start="495.219" dur="4.891">Justice and FBI and corruption and the</text>
  <text start="497.139" dur="6.571">FISA issues and other investigations</text>
  <text start="500.11" dur="6.179">that are going on so if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.71" dur="4.949">interested in getting a lot of</text>
  <text start="506.289" dur="4.921">information on that either catch my last</text>
  <text start="508.659" dur="4.831">night&amp;#39;s periscope or it&amp;#39;s on youtube I</text>
  <text start="511.21" dur="5.1">just uploaded it it took me like three</text>
  <text start="513.49" dur="6.599">or four hours to render and edit that</text>
  <text start="516.31" dur="5.849">video but I wasn&amp;#39;t checking my emails I</text>
  <text start="520.089" dur="5.701">was working on that video so that&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="522.159" dur="5.67">YouTube from last night there are a</text>
  <text start="525.79" dur="5.76">couple of things I&amp;#39;d like to talk about</text>
  <text start="527.829" dur="8.461">today concerning the FISA memo</text>
  <text start="531.55" dur="9.66">some issues that are being overlooked by</text>
  <text start="536.29" dur="9.06">most commentators okay so if you have</text>
  <text start="541.21" dur="8.22">been following my periscopes for the</text>
  <text start="545.35" dur="6.24">last two months some of this is going to</text>
  <text start="549.43" dur="4.23">be review for you you already know this</text>
  <text start="551.59" dur="5.04">stuff but for those of you who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="553.66" dur="7.41">know this I&amp;#39;m gonna do a little review</text>
  <text start="556.63" dur="6.78">of the FISA Court and the different ways</text>
  <text start="561.07" dur="3.48">that people get warrants through the</text>
  <text start="563.41" dur="3.69">FISA Court because this will help</text>
  <text start="564.55" dur="5.43">explain what&amp;#39;s going on there is a law</text>
  <text start="567.1" dur="4.26">that authorizes FISA Court it&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="569.98" dur="5.94">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</text>
  <text start="571.36" dur="6.14">eff is a the court is called FISC it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="575.92" dur="4.11">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</text>
  <text start="577.5" dur="6.22">it is the most secret Court in America</text>
  <text start="580.03" dur="8.22">it is literally I think in the basement</text>
  <text start="583.72" dur="7.56">of main justice everything that goes on</text>
  <text start="588.25" dur="5.97">there is classified they never allow</text>
  <text start="591.28" dur="5.24">reporters in there all the documents</text>
  <text start="594.22" dur="6.9">that come out of there classified when</text>
  <text start="596.52" dur="7.57">the FISA Court is convened they only</text>
  <text start="601.12" dur="5.73">allow prosecutors there are no defense</text>
  <text start="604.09" dur="6.06">attorneys allowed there because anyone</text>
  <text start="606.85" dur="8.58">who is going to be a target of a FISA</text>
  <text start="610.15" dur="8.19">warrant is suspected of being a threat</text>
  <text start="615.43" dur="5.52">to national security generally or a spy</text>
  <text start="618.34" dur="5.91">or involved in some counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="620.95" dur="5.1">operation so you go there because you</text>
  <text start="624.25" dur="4.5">want to get surveillance or spy on</text>
  <text start="626.05" dur="5.49">people who are bad actors and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="628.75" dur="4.77">have defense attorneys a representative</text>
  <text start="631.54" dur="5.46">from the FBI and the DOJ can go there</text>
  <text start="633.52" dur="6.09">they can present a an affidavit which</text>
  <text start="637" dur="7.05">has evidence and they ask for a warrant</text>
  <text start="639.61" dur="7.5">and there are a couple of different ways</text>
  <text start="644.05" dur="7.14">in which they do that and the ones that</text>
  <text start="647.11" dur="7.97">are important for this discussion there</text>
  <text start="651.19" dur="7.38">is what&amp;#39;s known as a title seven FISA</text>
  <text start="655.08" dur="5.94">application and there&amp;#39;s a title one FISA</text>
  <text start="658.57" dur="6.21">application and they are very different</text>
  <text start="661.02" dur="7.09">for different purposes okay</text>
  <text start="664.78" dur="6.29">so over the last couple of months we</text>
  <text start="668.11" dur="9.39">have been talking about title seven and</text>
  <text start="671.07" dur="8.17">that takes on the FISA 702 okay and</text>
  <text start="677.5" dur="6.69">we&amp;#39;ve been talking about FISA 702 s for</text>
  <text start="679.24" dur="7.08">a long time 702 is a it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s an</text>
  <text start="684.19" dur="6.39">American citizen they&amp;#39;re who their</text>
  <text start="686.32" dur="6.27">surveillance is being done on through</text>
  <text start="690.58" dur="3.39">the FISA Court and through the FISA</text>
  <text start="692.59" dur="5.73">database okay</text>
  <text start="693.97" dur="9.06">702 refers to an American citizen who is</text>
  <text start="698.32" dur="10.02">being surveilled under title seven of</text>
  <text start="703.03" dur="7.02">the FISA Act alright so we were under</text>
  <text start="708.34" dur="7.17">the assumption for the last three or</text>
  <text start="710.05" dur="8.25">four months that this whole you know</text>
  <text start="715.51" dur="4.35">FISA going into the database getting the</text>
  <text start="718.3" dur="5.46">information getting a warrants and also</text>
  <text start="719.86" dur="9.99">was being base was based on a title</text>
  <text start="723.76" dur="9.8">seven application and it wasn&amp;#39;t this</text>
  <text start="729.85" dur="5.58">whole thing involves a title one</text>
  <text start="733.56" dur="4.93">application which is completely</text>
  <text start="735.43" dur="6.12">different so we have learned a lot about</text>
  <text start="738.49" dur="4.38">FISA Court but the actual way that</text>
  <text start="741.55" dur="5.55">they&amp;#39;re doing this is not the way we</text>
  <text start="742.87" dur="6.45">thought it was and the way that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="747.1" dur="11.31">actually being done is much more</text>
  <text start="749.32" dur="11.87">nefarious so under title seven under</text>
  <text start="758.41" dur="4.74">title seven if you&amp;#39;re doing a 702</text>
  <text start="761.19" dur="4.99">application and you want to get you want</text>
  <text start="763.15" dur="6.75">to access the FISA database under 702</text>
  <text start="766.18" dur="7.08">under title seven that is called</text>
  <text start="769.9" dur="6.66">incidental collection of intelligence on</text>
  <text start="773.26" dur="5.39">a US citizen normally what needs to</text>
  <text start="776.56" dur="6.39">happen is you need to either have</text>

  <text start="797.38" dur="4.18">is how it typically go</text>
  <text start="798.59" dur="7.08">the incidental collection on an American</text>
  <text start="801.56" dur="6.39">citizen in under 702 is not very</text>
  <text start="805.67" dur="5.79">pervasive it&amp;#39;s not a real extensive</text>
  <text start="807.95" dur="6.72">information it&amp;#39;s only incidental it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="811.46" dur="5.46">you know the the Russian person or the</text>
  <text start="814.67" dur="3.81">the Korean person was talking to the</text>
  <text start="816.92" dur="4.08">American citizen they had an email they</text>
  <text start="818.48" dur="4.35">exchanged they had a phone call and what</text>
  <text start="821" dur="5.089">you&amp;#39;re really doing under 702 is you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="822.83" dur="6.949">looking at the information that is being</text>
  <text start="826.089" dur="6.821">exchanged with the foreign citizen and</text>
  <text start="829.779" dur="5.291">they&amp;#39;re normally the conversation on the</text>
  <text start="832.91" dur="5.72">American side is masked you don&amp;#39;t get to</text>
  <text start="835.07" dur="7.32">look at that information all right</text>
  <text start="838.63" dur="6.37">unmasking can be done if you can prove</text>
  <text start="842.39" dur="5.58">to the FISA Court that the American</text>
  <text start="845" dur="6.779">citizen is a threat to national security</text>
  <text start="847.97" dur="7.23">but even then all you&amp;#39;re doing is you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="851.779" dur="6.81">looking at incidental phone calls text</text>
  <text start="855.2" dur="7.079">messages and maybe some emails and only</text>
  <text start="858.589" dur="5.851">on that American citizen and and the</text>
  <text start="862.279" dur="5.461">foreign person who is actually the</text>
  <text start="864.44" dur="6.39">target of the surveillance so here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="867.74" dur="7.31">what you need to know FISA 702 gives you</text>
  <text start="870.83" dur="7.5">very limited information on the targets</text>
  <text start="875.05" dur="5.05">it&amp;#39;s is limited on the on the foreign</text>
  <text start="878.33" dur="3.39">target they can go and get all the</text>
  <text start="880.1" dur="5.19">information they want I&amp;#39;m the American</text>
  <text start="881.72" dur="5.28">target it&amp;#39;s very limited now we have</text>
  <text start="885.29" dur="4.68">been working on the assumption of the</text>
  <text start="887" dur="5.78">last two or three or four months that</text>
  <text start="889.97" dur="6.89">Carter page and manna fort and Trump</text>
  <text start="892.78" dur="8.5">were being surveilled under FISA 702</text>
  <text start="896.86" dur="6.849">which allows very limited access to</text>
  <text start="901.28" dur="4.77">information it&amp;#39;s only incidental</text>
  <text start="903.709" dur="5.551">collection and you have to be working on</text>
  <text start="906.05" dur="5.46">at a foreign target generally speaking</text>
  <text start="909.26" dur="3.329">all right well you could take that whole</text>
  <text start="911.51" dur="3.449">thing and throw it out the window</text>
  <text start="912.589" dur="5.401">because that is not what they were using</text>
  <text start="914.959" dur="5.25">to surveil Carter page they were using</text>
  <text start="917.99" dur="7.349">title one title one is completely</text>
  <text start="920.209" dur="10.561">different so let me give you an of title</text>
  <text start="925.339" dur="9.051">one FISA title one is</text>
  <text start="930.77" dur="7.8">the is a FISA warrant</text>
  <text start="934.39" dur="9.34">you would apply for if you thought the</text>
  <text start="938.57" dur="8.61">person the target is a spy is acting on</text>
  <text start="943.73" dur="5.25">behalf of a foreign government and they</text>
  <text start="947.18" dur="3.51">are that there are the target of a</text>
  <text start="948.98" dur="5.33">counterintelligence investigation it</text>
  <text start="950.69" dur="6.709">allows for complete and total</text>
  <text start="954.31" dur="5.05">surveillance live surveillance</text>
  <text start="957.399" dur="3.791">retroactive surveillance you can go back</text>
  <text start="959.36" dur="4.62">and look at records of their</text>
  <text start="961.19" dur="8.1">communications in the past and you can</text>
  <text start="963.98" dur="7.65">look at information regarding anyone</text>
  <text start="969.29" dur="4.79">that they communicate with in their</text>

  <text start="974.08" dur="9.16">anyone friends family connections anyone</text>
  <text start="979.3" dur="6.94">you can look at everybody everyone who</text>
  <text start="983.24" dur="5.01">has a conversation with the target you</text>
  <text start="986.24" dur="4.02">can look at all their emails all their</text>

  <text start="990.26" dur="5.01">their communications everyone who comes</text>
  <text start="992.99" dur="4.92">in contact with that target for a title</text>
  <text start="995.27" dur="5.33">one you can look at everything that at</text>
  <text start="997.91" dur="6.03">with anyone that they&amp;#39;re connected to</text>
  <text start="1000.6" dur="6.34">that is a very very wide net when you do</text>
  <text start="1003.94" dur="6.45">a title one FISA search you get this</text>
  <text start="1006.94" dur="5.639">massive return of data and it could</text>
  <text start="1010.39" dur="4.83">involve thousands of people and it gives</text>
  <text start="1012.579" dur="4.861">you everything that you want to know</text>
  <text start="1015.22" dur="6.6">about everybody who has any contact with</text>
  <text start="1017.44" dur="7.86">that person all right because the person</text>
  <text start="1021.82" dur="6.6">is deemed to be a spy who is working for</text>
  <text start="1025.3" dur="4.98">a foreign government and as poses a</text>
  <text start="1028.42" dur="5.25">clear and present danger to the American</text>
  <text start="1030.28" dur="8.07">government so because the threat of a</text>
  <text start="1033.67" dur="7.83">title one target is so great they gave</text>
  <text start="1038.35" dur="5.28">you great ability to surveil that person</text>
  <text start="1041.5" dur="6.36">and everyone they&amp;#39;re in contact with</text>
  <text start="1043.63" dur="5.97">that is not the case with FISA 702 with</text>
  <text start="1047.86" dur="3.69">702 it&amp;#39;s just in an incidental</text>
  <text start="1049.6" dur="5.49">collection all right and it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1051.55" dur="6.66">minimal information with title one they</text>
  <text start="1055.09" dur="5.43">can dig into every part of your life and</text>
  <text start="1058.21" dur="4.28">every part of the life of everyone</text>
  <text start="1060.52" dur="6.86">you&amp;#39;re in contact with</text>
  <text start="1062.49" dur="7.95">and Carter Paige was a volunteer with</text>
  <text start="1067.38" dur="7.74">the Trump campaign for about a month or</text>
  <text start="1070.44" dur="10.62">two and and that&amp;#39;s the whole thing</text>
  <text start="1075.12" dur="8.22">they used title one because they wanted</text>
  <text start="1081.06" dur="8.25">to get information on everybody on the</text>
  <text start="1083.34" dur="7.08">Trump campaign all right so let me let</text>
  <text start="1089.31" dur="4.44">me just explain what that means that</text>
  <text start="1090.42" dur="5.37">means that it wasn&amp;#39;t just mana for and</text>
  <text start="1093.75" dur="4.08">Paige and Trump that they were doing</text>
  <text start="1095.79" dur="4.29">surveillance on they were they could do</text>
  <text start="1097.83" dur="4.5">surveillance on everybody on the</text>
  <text start="1100.08" dur="5.1">campaign any one Carter page came in</text>
  <text start="1102.33" dur="4.59">contact with its literally if you had</text>
  <text start="1105.18" dur="3.93">any exposure and a connection to Carter</text>
  <text start="1106.92" dur="3.72">page they could dig through every part</text>

  <text start="1110.64" dur="7.17">information text emails phone calls to</text>

  <text start="1117.81" dur="4.41">literally spy on everybody on the Trump</text>
  <text start="1119.85" dur="5.63">campaign because of title one because</text>
  <text start="1122.22" dur="6.5">that&amp;#39;s what they were using now here is</text>
  <text start="1125.48" dur="8.91">the really the difficult part of this</text>
  <text start="1128.72" dur="8.56">because title one is such a serious</text>
  <text start="1134.39" dur="5.08">breach of the Fourth Amendment I mean</text>
  <text start="1137.28" dur="4.89">like the Fourth Amendment is the</text>
  <text start="1139.47" dur="5.76">amendment that grants us privacy against</text>
  <text start="1142.17" dur="7.53">unreasonable search and seizure a title</text>
  <text start="1145.23" dur="7.83">one FISA warrant totally strips you of</text>
  <text start="1149.7" dur="5.7">any privacy at all they can have agents</text>
  <text start="1153.06" dur="4.11">following you that listening to all your</text>
  <text start="1155.4" dur="3.03">phone calls and not the recorded stuff</text>
  <text start="1157.17" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s stored in the database they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1158.43" dur="3.78">monitoring you live and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1160.77" dur="3.27">monitoring all your conversations and</text>
  <text start="1162.21" dur="4.53">everyone all your contacts are being</text>
  <text start="1164.04" dur="5.09">monitored alright because it is such a</text>
  <text start="1166.74" dur="10.8">severe breach of the Fourth Amendment</text>
  <text start="1169.13" dur="12.49">the bar of evidence you have to produce</text>
  <text start="1177.54" dur="7.05">in FISA Court is very high all right you</text>
  <text start="1181.62" dur="6.8">have to show a lot of evidence and all</text>
  <text start="1184.59" dur="6.3">of the evidence has to be verified</text>
  <text start="1188.42" dur="5.97">because it&amp;#39;s such a breach of your</text>
  <text start="1190.89" dur="3.5">Fourth Amendment rights</text>
  <text start="1195.47" dur="7.27">this is a very serious thing in in</text>
  <text start="1198.96" dur="6.78">addition to that title one surveillance</text>
  <text start="1202.74" dur="5.97">for FISA Court has to be signed off by</text>
  <text start="1205.74" dur="6.06">the director of the FBI or the Deputy</text>
  <text start="1208.71" dur="5.55">Director of the FBI and the director of</text>
  <text start="1211.8" dur="5.46">sorry the Attorney General or the</text>
  <text start="1214.26" dur="5.82">assistant attorney general Oh</text>
  <text start="1217.26" dur="5.22">the other option in the DOJ is the</text>
  <text start="1220.08" dur="4.62">Deputy Attorney General who is in charge</text>
  <text start="1222.48" dur="4.83">of national security so there&amp;#39;s three</text>

  <text start="1227.31" dur="4.89">allowed to sign off on a title one FISA</text>

  <text start="1232.2" dur="4.08">people in the FBI and this the top three</text>
  <text start="1234.75" dur="3.27">people in the Department of Justice and</text>
  <text start="1236.28" dur="5.67">two people in the FAA they&amp;#39;re the only</text>

  <text start="1241.95" dur="6.75">applications and Comey signed three I</text>
  <text start="1245.58" dur="4.89">came signed one Sally Yates probably</text>
  <text start="1248.7" dur="3.9">signed two Danny bent a sign one rod</text>
  <text start="1250.47" dur="4.02">Rosen Stein said one it goes to top</text>
  <text start="1252.6" dur="6.5">level people in the department because</text>
  <text start="1254.49" dur="9.87">it&amp;#39;s a very serious level of intrusion</text>
  <text start="1259.1" dur="8.91">and the thing is when you&amp;#39;re presenting</text>
  <text start="1264.36" dur="6.6">evidence for a FISA Court for title one</text>
  <text start="1268.01" dur="6.91">you have to have really really solid</text>
  <text start="1270.96" dur="5.91">evidence generally speaking it&amp;#39;s that</text>
  <text start="1274.92" dur="4.29">serious that&amp;#39;s the issue I mean you</text>
  <text start="1276.87" dur="4.23">can&amp;#39;t this is not like a 702 this is</text>
  <text start="1279.21" dur="6.35">completely different though final one is</text>
  <text start="1281.1" dur="8.64">completely different so that is why</text>
  <text start="1285.56" dur="8.86">using the steel dossier to get a title</text>
  <text start="1289.74" dur="8.82">one FISA warrant is such a heinous crime</text>
  <text start="1294.42" dur="6.57">because Jim Comey himself told America</text>
