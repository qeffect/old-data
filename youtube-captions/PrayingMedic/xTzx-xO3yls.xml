  <text start="109.549" dur="6.85">I struggled for a long time to see</text>
  <text start="112.649" dur="7.171">cancer healed and once the Lord showed</text>
  <text start="116.399" dur="5.4">me a strategy that works it became a</text>
  <text start="119.82" dur="4.77">probably pretty regular thing actually</text>

  <text start="124.59" dur="5.85">people a lot of people who see who are</text>
  <text start="126.24" dur="5.29">healed of cancer but it&amp;#39;s really a</text>
  <text start="130.44" dur="3.97">matter of</text>
  <text start="131.53" dur="4.49">developing strategy asking the Lord to</text>
  <text start="134.41" dur="4.11">show you something</text>
  <text start="136.02" dur="6.01">for a specific condition that is going</text>
  <text start="138.52" dur="6.54">to work and I wanted to talk a little</text>
  <text start="142.03" dur="6.6">bit about that this morning because</text>
  <text start="145.06" dur="6.59">cancer is second to heart disease is the</text>
  <text start="148.63" dur="6.45">number two killer in America right</text>
  <text start="151.65" dur="5.77">healing basics of healing and I have</text>
  <text start="155.08" dur="3.78">friends who have theological differences</text>
  <text start="157.42" dur="3.09">with me they don&amp;#39;t agree with my</text>
  <text start="158.86" dur="7.98">perspective on God they don&amp;#39;t agree with</text>
  <text start="160.51" dur="10.05">my teachings and that&amp;#39;s fine but I have</text>
  <text start="166.84" dur="5.69">have a lot of testimonies of from people</text>
  <text start="170.56" dur="3.99">that have been healed I&amp;#39;ve seen miracles</text>
  <text start="172.53" dur="5.77">thousands of them before my very eyes</text>
  <text start="174.55" dur="6.99">I&amp;#39;ve seen lots of people healed and this</text>
  <text start="178.3" dur="6.6">is a very biblical this is this should</text>
  <text start="181.54" dur="6.12">be Christianity 101 it should be</text>
  <text start="184.9" dur="5.46">Christianity 101 it&amp;#39;s really that simple</text>
  <text start="187.66" dur="7.68">so gonna go to Matthew chapter 10 and</text>
  <text start="190.36" dur="8.849">just do a real quick reading and this is</text>
  <text start="195.34" dur="6.84">Matthew chapter 10 verse 1 when he Jesus</text>
  <text start="199.209" dur="7.461">had called the twelve disciples to him</text>
  <text start="202.18" dur="7.65">after he had prayed and all night and</text>
  <text start="206.67" dur="6.069">the father showed Jesus who he should</text>
  <text start="209.83" dur="7.409">choose as disciples he called the twelve</text>
  <text start="212.739" dur="8.041">disciples to him he gave them power he</text>
  <text start="217.239" dur="8.881">gave them power over unclean spirits to</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="9.33">cast them out and to heal all kinds of</text>
  <text start="226.12" dur="5.73">sickness and disease and then it goes on</text>
  <text start="230.11" dur="3.27">to name the name of the the twelve</text>
  <text start="231.85" dur="4.169">apostles the twelve disciples that he</text>
  <text start="233.38" dur="5.16">chose right and then he sends them out</text>
  <text start="236.019" dur="5.041">these twelve he sent out commanded them</text>
  <text start="238.54" dur="4.8">saying do not go the way the Gentiles</text>
  <text start="241.06" dur="4.95">and do not enter the city the Samaritans</text>
  <text start="243.34" dur="7.08">go to the lost sheep the house of Israel</text>
  <text start="246.01" dur="6.81">and as you go preach saying the kingdom</text>
  <text start="250.42" dur="3.93">of heaven is at hand so they were going</text>
  <text start="252.82" dur="3.659">to go and heal the sick and cast out</text>
  <text start="254.35" dur="4.8">demons and they&amp;#39;re going to demonstrate</text>
  <text start="256.479" dur="3.901">the realities of the fact that the</text>
  <text start="259.15" dur="4.05">kingdom of heaven</text>
  <text start="260.38" dur="5.79">come heal the sick cleanse the lepers</text>
  <text start="263.2" dur="7.71">raise the dead cast out demons really</text>
  <text start="266.17" dur="6.96">received really good all right so that</text>
  <text start="270.91" dur="4.92">is his commission to the 12 now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="273.13" dur="4.23">gonna go real quickly to Luke 9 it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="2.91">parallel passage but it kind of just</text>
  <text start="277.36" dur="5.73">summarizes that whole thing a little bit</text>
  <text start="278.74" dur="8.76">more more briefly Luke 9 chapter what</text>
  <text start="283.09" dur="5.97">sorry verse 1 says he called the 12</text>
  <text start="287.5" dur="6.9">disciples together and gave them power</text>
  <text start="289.06" dur="6.93">and authority over all demons and to</text>
  <text start="294.4" dur="3.45">cure diseases</text>
  <text start="295.99" dur="5.97">he gave them two things he gave them</text>
  <text start="297.85" dur="8.76">power he gave them authority all right</text>
  <text start="301.96" dur="7.59">over demons and to cure diseases power</text>
  <text start="306.61" dur="5.79">and authority all right healing</text>
  <text start="309.55" dur="6.93">deliverance miracles right two different</text>
  <text start="312.4" dur="5.1">things so I wanted to do read one more</text>
  <text start="316.48" dur="4.17">thing P real quick</text>
  <text start="317.5" dur="5.25">so he sent out the twelve they went out</text>
  <text start="320.65" dur="4.77">that cast out demons that healed the</text>
  <text start="322.75" dur="6.39">sick they came back they gave the</text>
  <text start="325.42" dur="5.67">testimony of what they had seen Lord</text>
  <text start="329.14" dur="3.78">even that demons are subject to us in</text>
  <text start="331.09" dur="4.65">your name and he said don&amp;#39;t rejoice it</text>
  <text start="332.92" dur="4.44">the demons obey you rejoice that your</text>
  <text start="335.74" dur="5.75">names are written the book of life right</text>
  <text start="337.36" dur="8.43">so then he sent out the seventy and then</text>
  <text start="341.49" dur="7.2">after he died and was resurrected and he</text>
  <text start="345.79" dur="6.21">appeared to them Acts chapter one</text>
  <text start="348.69" dur="5.41">he&amp;#39;s the disciples were two gathered</text>
  <text start="352" dur="4.65">together and it says that being</text>
  <text start="354.1" dur="4.5">assembled together with them he Jesus</text>
  <text start="356.65" dur="4.47">commanded them not to depart from</text>
  <text start="358.6" dur="4.74">Jerusalem but to wait for the promise of</text>
  <text start="361.12" dur="4.74">the father which he said you have heard</text>
  <text start="363.34" dur="4.71">from me for John truly baptized with</text>
  <text start="365.86" dur="4.59">water but you shall be baptized with the</text>
  <text start="368.05" dur="4.2">Holy Spirit not many days from now</text>
  <text start="370.45" dur="3.45">therefore they as they come together</text>
  <text start="372.25" dur="4.08">they asked him Lord will you at this</text>
  <text start="373.9" dur="4.29">time restore the kingdom to Israel and</text>
  <text start="376.33" dur="4.2">he said to them it is not for you to</text>
  <text start="378.19" dur="4.55">know the times or the seasons which the</text>
  <text start="380.53" dur="7.02">father has put into his own authority</text>
  <text start="382.74" dur="7.18">for you shall receive power when the</text>
  <text start="387.55" dur="6.36">Holy Spirit has come upon you and</text>
  <text start="389.92" dur="6.33">and and you shall be my witnesses into</text>
  <text start="393.91" dur="6.21">Jerusalem Judea Samaria all ends of the</text>
  <text start="396.25" dur="5.28">earth right so he told them to wait for</text>
  <text start="400.12" dur="2.88">the baptism the Holy Spirit would come</text>
  <text start="401.53" dur="2.97">they would be endued with he said you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="403" dur="2.61">be endued with power from on high in</text>
  <text start="404.5" dur="6.15">another passage</text>
  <text start="405.61" dur="6.99">all right so power and authority healing</text>
  <text start="410.65" dur="5.88">and miracles and deliverance is an issue</text>
  <text start="412.6" dur="6.69">of power and authority when you are</text>
  <text start="416.53" dur="6.3">filled with and baptized with the Holy</text>
  <text start="419.29" dur="6.66">Spirit you receive power the power of</text>
  <text start="422.83" dur="5.67">God the same power that created the</text>
  <text start="425.95" dur="6.51">earth and the universe that power lives</text>
  <text start="428.5" dur="7.08">in us working creative miracles is an</text>
  <text start="432.46" dur="5.85">issue of releasing that power just</text>
  <text start="435.58" dur="4.98">release the power put your hand out and</text>
  <text start="438.31" dur="4.4">you and the power of God flows out of</text>
  <text start="440.56" dur="6.62">you through faith that&amp;#39;s the trigger</text>
  <text start="442.71" dur="8.02">your body is like a vessel of power and</text>
  <text start="447.18" dur="7.54">you open the vessel and the power flows</text>
  <text start="450.73" dur="7.38">out when you believe to those who</text>
  <text start="454.72" dur="6.81">believe all things are possible Matthew</text>
  <text start="458.11" dur="6.06">17 they try to cast out a demon lord why</text>
  <text start="461.53" dur="6.06">could we not cast out this demon jesus</text>
  <text start="464.17" dur="7.08">said because of your unbelief lack of</text>
  <text start="467.59" dur="6.15">faith if you believe if you have faith</text>
  <text start="471.25" dur="4.92">that when you put your hand on that</text>
  <text start="473.74" dur="4.68">person that the power of God is going to</text>
  <text start="476.17" dur="4.56">leave your body and create a miracle or</text>
  <text start="478.42" dur="5.82">heal them it&amp;#39;ll happen when you have</text>
  <text start="480.73" dur="5.67">faith faith is confidence it is</text>
  <text start="484.24" dur="4.11">confidence that what you read in the</text>
  <text start="486.4" dur="3.63">Bible what Jesus told you is actually</text>
  <text start="488.35" dur="6.24">going to happen it&amp;#39;s confidence it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="490.03" dur="7.2">faith it is the confident assurance of</text>
  <text start="494.59" dur="4.98">what God said and it&amp;#39;s gonna happen and</text>
  <text start="497.23" dur="3.6">I had a lot of difficulty when I first</text>
  <text start="499.57" dur="3.12">started praying for people to be healed</text>
  <text start="500.83" dur="4.77">because I was begging God to heal people</text>
  <text start="502.69" dur="5.01">and I I did that for three or four</text>
  <text start="505.6" dur="3.84">months never saw anybody healed begging</text>
  <text start="507.7" dur="2.94">God Oh Lord if it&amp;#39;s your well please</text>
  <text start="509.44" dur="3.5">heal this person never saw anybody</text>
  <text start="510.64" dur="2.3">healed</text>
  <text start="513.52" dur="3.9">I had to renew my mind to the truth and</text>
  <text start="515.56" dur="5.1">I had to start believing and trusting</text>
  <text start="517.42" dur="6.03">and developing silicon</text>
  <text start="520.66" dur="6">that that person was actually going to</text>
  <text start="523.45" dur="4.56">be healed and I learned about authority</text>
  <text start="526.66" dur="4.55">and I learned about power now let&amp;#39;s talk</text>
  <text start="528.01" dur="5.43">about authority power is releasing</text>
  <text start="531.21" dur="6.46">letting the power of God flow out of</text>
  <text start="533.44" dur="6.12">your body and into sick people and they</text>
  <text start="537.67" dur="3.08">received creative miracle or heal a</text>
  <text start="539.56" dur="3.6">little bit sickness or whatever</text>
  <text start="540.75" dur="4.48">Authority is company is different</text>
  <text start="543.16" dur="4.77">authority is an issue of knowing who you</text>
  <text start="545.23" dur="6.8">are and as a disciple as a follower of</text>
  <text start="547.93" dur="7.59">Jesus as a child of God it&amp;#39;s an issue of</text>
  <text start="552.03" dur="5.38">knowing your identity knowing who you</text>
  <text start="555.52" dur="5.22">are that&amp;#39;s what it is</text>
  <text start="557.41" dur="10.98">it&amp;#39;s knowing your identity and authority</text>
  <text start="560.74" dur="10.65">is is bestowed upon someone by another</text>
  <text start="568.39" dur="5.13">person who has authority a king appoints</text>
  <text start="571.39" dur="3.93">ambassadors because the king is the</text>
  <text start="573.52" dur="4.41">ultimate authority over his kingdom and</text>
  <text start="575.32" dur="6.81">he can appoint ambassadors who represent</text>
  <text start="577.93" dur="7.28">him the Apostle Paul said we are</text>
  <text start="582.13" dur="6.78">ambassadors of Christ we are his</text>
  <text start="585.21" dur="6.01">representatives here in the earth so we</text>
  <text start="588.91" dur="4.89">are ambassadors of God we are his</text>
  <text start="591.22" dur="6.93">representatives we he has given us</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="7.74">authority to represent him to manifest</text>
  <text start="598.15" dur="5.16">make known to the world his kingdom his</text>
  <text start="601.54" dur="4.41">goodness his love his compassion his</text>
  <text start="603.31" dur="5.03">power his mercy his desire for us to be</text>
  <text start="605.95" dur="4.94">healed and live a prosperous life</text>
  <text start="608.34" dur="6.01">manifesting the kingdom he&amp;#39;s given us</text>
  <text start="610.89" dur="4.57">authority to represent him before people</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="7.44">who don&amp;#39;t know him</text>
  <text start="615.46" dur="9.02">all right so Authority is often used to</text>
  <text start="621.79" dur="6">cast out evil spirits and demons</text>
  <text start="624.48" dur="6.28">authority can also be used to cast out</text>
  <text start="627.79" dur="6.42">or remove things that are not supposed</text>
  <text start="630.76" dur="5.22">to be there you can remove evil spirits</text>
  <text start="634.21" dur="3.51">but you can also remove tumors you can</text>
  <text start="635.98" dur="5.94">remove bacterial infections you can</text>
  <text start="637.72" dur="6.21">remove a disease you can remove gross</text>
  <text start="641.92" dur="5.3">masses you know if somebody has a</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="5.46">cerebral mass or they&amp;#39;ve got some</text>
  <text start="647.22" dur="4.99">anatomical structure that is not</text>
  <text start="649.39" dur="4.81">supposed to be there or anything that is</text>
  <text start="652.21" dur="3.88">not supposed to be there you</text>
  <text start="654.2" dur="3.87">can use authority and command it to</text>
  <text start="656.09" dur="4.35">leave right the same thing with</text>
  <text start="658.07" dur="5.79">deliverance but it works for other</text>
  <text start="660.44" dur="6.66">things too and authority is really</text>
  <text start="663.86" dur="9.09">powerful in removing tumors and cancer</text>
  <text start="667.1" dur="8.61">that&amp;#39;s just been my experience now Jesus</text>
  <text start="672.95" dur="7.07">said the son can do nothing of himself</text>
  <text start="675.71" dur="4.31">but only what he sees the father doing</text>
  <text start="680.83" dur="7.6">the key to operating successfully as a</text>
  <text start="685.55" dur="7.68">child of God is knowing what the father</text>
  <text start="688.43" dur="7.5">is doing we have to ask God how do I do</text>
  <text start="693.23" dur="5.58">this what is the approach is gonna work</text>
  <text start="695.93" dur="5.01">should I release power should I exercise</text>
  <text start="698.81" dur="5.04">authority should I do this what&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="700.94" dur="4.92">key how do i what what devices demonic</text>
  <text start="703.85" dur="3.78">devices am i up against what are the</text>
  <text start="705.86" dur="4.41">names that demons if this person you</text>
  <text start="707.63" dur="5.15">know has that are controlling them right</text>
  <text start="710.27" dur="4.56">you so now we&amp;#39;re getting into revelation</text>
  <text start="712.78" dur="3.37">we&amp;#39;re getting into words of knowledge</text>
  <text start="714.83" dur="3.9">words of wisdom</text>
  <text start="716.15" dur="5.64">we&amp;#39;re getting into how God communicates</text>
  <text start="718.73" dur="5.94">to us his will secrets that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="721.79" dur="5.6">know things we don&amp;#39;t understand I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="724.67" dur="5.19">talked about this before when Denise</text>
  <text start="727.39" dur="5.74">she&amp;#39;s had a lot of issues with gluten</text>
  <text start="729.86" dur="4.56">intolerance I&amp;#39;ve prayed over her a</text>
  <text start="733.13" dur="6.15">thousand times and she hasn&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="734.42" dur="8.4">healed and one night I was kind of</text>
  <text start="739.28" dur="7.44">desperate I was talking to God and I</text>
  <text start="742.82" dur="5.1">said okay okay okay okay show me what</text>
  <text start="746.72" dur="3.48">I&amp;#39;m missing what am I missing</text>

  <text start="835.239" dur="6.03">medicine medications recommended by this</text>
  <text start="837.999" dur="6.39">doctor and it has to do with methylation</text>
