  <text start="80.36" dur="4.77">that is a little bit controversial and</text>
  <text start="83.05" dur="4.15">we might be bound to hurt someone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="85.13" dur="5.16">feelings in the process of talking about</text>

  <text start="101.96" dur="5.94">always the easiest thing you want to so</text>
  <text start="105.14" dur="4.14">today&amp;#39;s discussion is going to be about</text>
  <text start="107.9" dur="4.89">something near and dear to my wife&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="109.28" dur="5.58">heart and my heart which is being a</text>
  <text start="112.79" dur="4.2">church dropout there&amp;#39;s a recent study</text>
  <text start="114.86" dur="5.369">that came out that showed that churches</text>
  <text start="116.99" dur="4.19">are losing members fairly rapidly and a</text>
  <text start="120.229" dur="3.421">lot of the people are leaving</text>
  <text start="121.18" dur="4.69">traditional Church settings our mature</text>
  <text start="123.65" dur="4.44">believers who are very connected to</text>
  <text start="125.87" dur="5.28">Jesus they have a very good walk with</text>
  <text start="128.09" dur="6">the Lord but for various reasons they</text>
  <text start="131.15" dur="5.07">are kind of done with Church yeah I</text>
  <text start="134.09" dur="3.63">think it&amp;#39;s interesting that historically</text>
  <text start="136.22" dur="3.54">a lot of the people who end up leaving</text>
  <text start="137.72" dur="3.54">church are immature believers are</text>
  <text start="139.76" dur="4.14">phenomenal believers maybe don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="141.26" dur="4.41">real strong faith and at least what</text>
  <text start="143.9" dur="3.33">we&amp;#39;ve been told over the years is that</text>
  <text start="145.67" dur="3.51">people who don&amp;#39;t go to church are those</text>
  <text start="147.23" dur="3.599">you have a weaker relationship with God</text>
  <text start="149.18" dur="2.5">and people with strong relationships</text>
  <text start="150.829" dur="3.311">with God tip</text>
  <text start="151.68" dur="5.43">the stake admitted going to church being</text>
  <text start="154.14" dur="5.28">involved in church activities and this</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="5.01">recent study kind of turns that upside</text>
  <text start="159.42" dur="4.289">down and shows that a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="162.12" dur="3.72">are have been walked with Lord for a</text>
  <text start="163.709" dur="4.051">very long time and our operating and the</text>
  <text start="165.84" dur="3.569">gifts of the Spirit and are very you</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="3.24">know well versed with the Bible a lot of</text>
  <text start="169.409" dur="4.05">them are feeling like there&amp;#39;s nothing</text>
  <text start="171" dur="3.45">for them left in the church they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="173.459" dur="2.941">really learning they&amp;#39;re not really</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="4.409">growing and so a lot of them are</text>
  <text start="176.4" dur="4.38">venturing out of the church and finding</text>
  <text start="178.859" dur="3.72">other venues to connect these believers</text>
  <text start="180.78" dur="5.489">right and now there&amp;#39;s so much available</text>
  <text start="182.579" dur="5.671">online on YouTube teachings that you can</text>
  <text start="186.269" dur="5.161">hook up with with other ministries</text>
  <text start="188.25" dur="5.28">around the world and even and people are</text>
  <text start="191.43" dur="4.229">being able to find what they&amp;#39;re looking</text>
  <text start="193.53" dur="4.709">for in other places sometimes I think</text>
  <text start="195.659" dur="5.851">the church the traditional church</text>
  <text start="198.239" dur="6.09">building in church its kind of left the</text>
  <text start="201.51" dur="5.819">mature believers behind in a way they do</text>
  <text start="204.329" dur="6.33">kind of cater to new believers and</text>
  <text start="207.329" dur="6.121">teaching basics and then know when you</text>
  <text start="210.659" dur="4.83">get mature you just keep listening to</text>
  <text start="213.45" dur="3.78">the basics yeah when I was going to</text>
  <text start="215.489" dur="3.96">Calvary Chapel most of the Calvary</text>
  <text start="217.23" dur="3.629">Chapel of pastors their thing was they</text>
  <text start="219.449" dur="3.63">would go through the Bible and we take</text>
  <text start="220.859" dur="4.171">them anywhere between four and six years</text>
  <text start="223.079" dur="3.511">to go through the entire Bible and then</text>
  <text start="225.03" dur="3.51">he would start over again back to</text>
  <text start="226.59" dur="3.81">Genesis and go back through it again and</text>
  <text start="228.54" dur="3.36">that was kind of their model teach all</text>
  <text start="230.4" dur="3.6">the way through the Bible but not much</text>
  <text start="231.9" dur="4.83">beyond that and if you&amp;#39;ve been a</text>
  <text start="234" dur="3.75">believer for 10 or 15 years I mean yeah</text>
  <text start="236.73" dur="3.06">you&amp;#39;re gonna pick up new things along</text>
  <text start="237.75" dur="4.799">the way but there&amp;#39;s not a lot of growth</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="4.339">in that coddle of teaching yeah and so I</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="3.571">think when people are leaving the church</text>
  <text start="244.129" dur="4.301">they&amp;#39;re not leaving because they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="246.12" dur="4.109">giving up on God I mean some people are</text>
  <text start="248.43" dur="4.139">but if they&amp;#39;ve been there a long time</text>
  <text start="250.229" dur="3.781">and they&amp;#39;re leaving I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="252.569" dur="3.691">times it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="254.01" dur="3.93">something more or they just feel like</text>
  <text start="256.26" dur="4.17">they don&amp;#39;t need that anymore that</text>
  <text start="257.94" dur="5.64">hand-holding and spoon-feeding</text>
  <text start="260.43" dur="4.979">they are able to go out and find the</text>
  <text start="263.58" dur="3.839">information they want and they are able</text>
  <text start="265.409" dur="5.101">to just communicate directly with the</text>
  <text start="267.419" dur="5.22">father and with Jesus and get downloads</text>
  <text start="270.51" dur="4.17">that&amp;#39;s I think one of the interesting</text>
  <text start="272.639" dur="5.041">things that&amp;#39;s happened in the church in</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="5.099">the last 10 years is the advent of</text>
  <text start="277.68" dur="4.77">schools of supernatural ministry right</text>
  <text start="279.779" dur="4.331">and some people would say that is an</text>
  <text start="282.45" dur="4.66">answer to true</text>
  <text start="284.11" dur="5.22">no seminaries and Bible colleges and in</text>
  <text start="287.11" dur="5.67">a way it is but in another way</text>
  <text start="289.33" dur="5.64">see Bible colleges and seminaries have</text>
  <text start="292.78" dur="4.35">been specifically designed to train</text>
  <text start="294.97" dur="5.34">people who want to go into court full</text>
  <text start="297.13" dur="5.88">time ministry core which is another myth</text>
  <text start="300.31" dur="4.44">we could probably talk about mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="303.01" dur="3.3">in another podcast you know Bible</text>
  <text start="304.75" dur="2.7">colleges and seminaries typically train</text>
  <text start="306.31" dur="4.26">people who want to be pastors and</text>
  <text start="307.45" dur="5.28">missionaries right but what is there for</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="4.05">advanced training and education for the</text>
  <text start="312.73" dur="3.75">average believer who has a full-time job</text>
  <text start="314.62" dur="3.51">who is not interested in pastoring a</text>
  <text start="316.48" dur="3.84">church or being a full-time you know</text>
  <text start="318.13" dur="4.74">evangelist or missionary so you have all</text>
  <text start="320.32" dur="4.62">these like Bethel is the big one they</text>
  <text start="322.87" dur="3.75">have all these schools of supernatural</text>
  <text start="324.94" dur="5.7">ministry that they sponsored all around</text>
  <text start="326.62" dur="5.88">the world now a lot of basic churches</text>
  <text start="330.64" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t teach anything about the prophetic</text>
  <text start="332.5" dur="4.83">they may not even really believe that</text>
  <text start="334.39" dur="5.31">people can hear from God same way a</text>
  <text start="337.33" dur="4.2">minister can you know go and then</text>
  <text start="339.7" dur="3.75">deliverance and healing right and</text>
  <text start="341.53" dur="3.78">emotional healing and you know right the</text>
  <text start="343.45" dur="4.47">courts of heaven them right the other</text>
  <text start="345.31" dur="4.08">girls go on yeah I mean that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="347.92" dur="4.44">like Holy Spirit high school or maybe</text>
  <text start="349.39" dur="5.34">college and I think there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="352.36" dur="4.08">churches that have a difficulty and</text>
  <text start="354.73" dur="3.42">putting out teaching the challenges</text>
  <text start="356.44" dur="8.76">people that have been believers for long</text>
  <text start="358.15" dur="8.88">time yeah when you&amp;#39;re in the ambulance</text>
  <text start="365.2" dur="3.81">and you might be praying for someone or</text>
  <text start="367.03" dur="4.32">ministering oh gosh one of the first</text>
  <text start="369.01" dur="4.8">questions they ask you where do you go</text>
  <text start="371.35" dur="4.8">to church right and it&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="373.81" dur="5.58">difficult you feel like you have to say</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="6.03">well I don&amp;#39;t go to church but you always</text>
  <text start="379.39" dur="4.29">have to have a but and explain away why</text>
  <text start="382.18" dur="5.97">you&amp;#39;re still walking with the Lord</text>
  <text start="383.68" dur="7.02">everybody has a butt my butt is but I</text>
  <text start="388.15" dur="4.35">work every Sunday so that&amp;#39;s why the good</text>
  <text start="390.7" dur="3.72">information you know and I do work every</text>
  <text start="392.5" dur="4.2">Sunday but I&amp;#39;m not sure you would go to</text>
  <text start="394.42" dur="4.77">church if you didn&amp;#39;t I mean no I guess</text>
  <text start="396.7" dur="4.56">at this point well when we were living</text>
  <text start="399.19" dur="3.81">in Washington State we had three</text>
  <text start="401.26" dur="4.44">churches that we used to kind of go</text>
  <text start="403" dur="4.62">around to from time to time and we</text>
  <text start="405.7" dur="4.47">didn&amp;#39;t really commit to any one church</text>
  <text start="407.62" dur="5.04">and they were all really good right they</text>
  <text start="410.17" dur="4.89">were all really good and if you need to</text>
  <text start="412.66" dur="4.74">look into a good church in the Olympia</text>
  <text start="415.06" dur="3.08">Washington area the churches we went to</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="3.86">work</text>
  <text start="418.14" dur="4.47">revival tub rivers of grace as four</text>
  <text start="421.26" dur="5.01">years ago but they&amp;#39;re all really good</text>
  <text start="422.61" dur="5.64">but anyway if we had that same level of</text>
  <text start="426.27" dur="4.74">community here where we are now in</text>
  <text start="428.25" dur="4.68">Arizona we might be going I mean maybe</text>
  <text start="431.01" dur="5.22">not every week but we would certainly</text>
  <text start="432.93" dur="4.98">visit and fellowship and all the things</text>
  <text start="436.23" dur="3.42">we used to do and there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="437.91" dur="3.72">different reasons why people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="439.65" dur="4.89">attend church on a regular basis I mean</text>
  <text start="441.63" dur="4.65">some people are not going to church</text>
  <text start="444.54" dur="3.27">because they&amp;#39;re having some issues with</text>
  <text start="446.28" dur="2.13">God I did when I was going through my</text>
  <text start="447.81" dur="3.06">divorce</text>
  <text start="448.41" dur="5.4">I couldn&amp;#39;t get within 200 feet of my</text>
  <text start="450.87" dur="5.91">church I was so racked with guilt and</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="4.68">shame I just did not want to go anywhere</text>
  <text start="456.78" dur="3.93">near a church I didn&amp;#39;t want to read my</text>
  <text start="458.49" dur="3.93">Bible because God was speaking through</text>
  <text start="460.71" dur="5.28">all this stuff and I didn&amp;#39;t like what</text>
  <text start="462.42" dur="5.58">you say so yeah some people leave the</text>
  <text start="465.99" dur="4.02">church scene because they&amp;#39;re having some</text>
  <text start="468" dur="4.47">relationship issues it&amp;#39;s got but a lot</text>
  <text start="470.01" dur="4.92">of people have kind of walked out on the</text>
  <text start="472.47" dur="5.01">institutional church because of things</text>
  <text start="474.93" dur="4.17">like leadership abuse some people feel</text>
  <text start="477.48" dur="2.91">like they have gifts and they&amp;#39;re trained</text>
  <text start="479.1" dur="3">to do things and they have no</text>
  <text start="480.39" dur="3.69">opportunities to do that they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="482.1" dur="4.65">ministry time a lot of people feel like</text>
  <text start="484.08" dur="4.77">they would like to do more higher level</text>
  <text start="486.75" dur="3.9">things but the leadership is kind of</text>
  <text start="488.85" dur="3.18">keeping them down and so now you know we</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="3.329">haven&amp;#39;t released you into doing that yet</text>
  <text start="492.03" dur="3.96">so there&amp;#39;s some control issues that go</text>
  <text start="493.979" dur="4.981">into play yeah I think there are some</text>
  <text start="495.99" dur="5.46">churches that definitely are open and</text>
  <text start="498.96" dur="5.519">are encouraging believers to go farther</text>
  <text start="501.45" dur="5.19">and we&amp;#39;ll just set you free you know and</text>
  <text start="504.479" dur="3.961">let you go and they will encourage you</text>
  <text start="506.64" dur="5.64">and pray for you and do anything they</text>
  <text start="508.44" dur="5.13">can to let you find your place in God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="512.28" dur="3.75">kingdom and where you what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="513.57" dur="5.48">supposed to be doing but that&amp;#39;s not true</text>
  <text start="516.03" dur="5.67">of all churches yet I mean I pray that</text>
  <text start="519.05" dur="5.74">you know we could get to that place at</text>
  <text start="521.7" dur="5.04">some point yeah it&amp;#39;s hard for us to find</text>
  <text start="524.79" dur="3.96">a church here in the Phoenix area that</text>
  <text start="526.74" dur="3.99">has the kind of things we&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="528.75" dur="5.15">interested in learning about we&amp;#39;ve tried</text>
  <text start="530.73" dur="3.17">you&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of different places</text>
  <text start="534.17" dur="7.36">ventured out and for me the Lord pretty</text>
  <text start="538.77" dur="4.23">clearly told me years ago there wasn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="541.53" dur="3.45">whole lot for me inside the</text>
  <text start="543" dur="4.83">institutional Church go on this you know</text>
  <text start="544.98" dur="5.22">the church gatherings on Sunday he made</text>
  <text start="547.83" dur="3.48">it very very clear look I have other</text>
  <text start="550.2" dur="2.759">places</text>
  <text start="551.31" dur="3.449">and what other people I want you to meet</text>
  <text start="552.959" dur="3.781">you&amp;#39;re gonna be a fellowship somewhere</text>
  <text start="554.759" dur="4.591">else a lot of you know for about three</text>
  <text start="556.74" dur="4.949">or four years most of my fellowship was</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="4.38">on Facebook mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="561.689" dur="4.44">I spent seven or eight hours a day on</text>
  <text start="563.73" dur="5.25">Facebook Church yeah yeah bring the</text>
  <text start="566.129" dur="4.411">people in singing and you can do a lot</text>
  <text start="568.98" dur="3.87">and you did do a lot</text>
  <text start="570.54" dur="11.909">well you&amp;#39;re still doing a lot I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="572.85" dur="12.12">amazed at how much not going to church</text>
  <text start="582.449" dur="6.06">and one of the things that I miss about</text>
  <text start="584.97" dur="5.159">church is the corporate worship because</text>
  <text start="588.509" dur="4.5">you can worship at home but it&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="590.129" dur="6">gonna be like that with a whole room</text>

  <text start="1141.46" dur="4.08">church you do get something out of it</text>
  <text start="1143.38" dur="4.47">you know when you&amp;#39;re a new believer you</text>
  <text start="1145.54" dur="5.91">get a lot and you know sometimes you can</text>
  <text start="1147.85" dur="7.23">learn new things like I I would like to</text>
  <text start="1151.45" dur="5.73">be studying the Bible with someone who</text>
  <text start="1155.08" dur="3.93">is more prophetic you know like when I</text>
  <text start="1157.18" dur="4.26">learned I was in an evangelical church</text>
  <text start="1159.01" dur="4.35">so everything was about evangelizing you</text>
  <text start="1161.44" dur="3.39">know you weren&amp;#39;t talking about healing</text>
  <text start="1163.36" dur="3.78">in fact they didn&amp;#39;t even really believe</text>
  <text start="1164.83" dur="4.14">that God heals anymore when there was</text>
  <text start="1167.14" dur="3.87">prayer for someone who was sick</text>
  <text start="1168.97" dur="6.21">it was always prayer to guide the</text>
  <text start="1171.01" dur="5.82">doctors if it&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s will yeah this</text>
  <text start="1175.18" dur="4.29">person but they really didn&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="1176.83" dur="4.77">healing in miracles really or laying on</text>
  <text start="1179.47" dur="4.08">of hands or any of that stuff and now</text>
  <text start="1181.6" dur="4.62">you know it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;ve learned so much</text>
  <text start="1183.55" dur="5.79">more and in different ways since then</text>
  <text start="1186.22" dur="5.61">and you feel like your prophetic calling</text>
  <text start="1189.34" dur="3.87">has been stymied a little bit because</text>
  <text start="1191.83" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re not around a lot of prophetic</text>
  <text start="1193.21" dur="4.23">people right now yeah you know it would</text>
  <text start="1195.55" dur="3.93">be good I mean I guess I could sign up</text>
  <text start="1197.44" dur="3.9">for something Lauren you signed up for</text>
  <text start="1199.48" dur="3.93">several things but you have a lot on</text>
  <text start="1201.34" dur="4.32">your plate oh yeah yeah you know I feel</text>
  <text start="1203.41" dur="4.71">like it&amp;#39;s good to get a fresh look at</text>
  <text start="1205.66" dur="4.65">the Bible with different eyes and</text>
  <text start="1208.12" dur="4.08">different understanding as you grow you</text>
  <text start="1210.31" dur="3.79">know rather than taking what everyone</text>
  <text start="1212.2" dur="3.97">taught you in the beginning as through</text>
  <text start="1214.1" dur="4.41">so it sounds like what you&amp;#39;re saying to</text>
