  <text start="54.39" dur="3.57">start out with a question here is it a</text>
  <text start="55.68" dur="4.89">coincidence that Democrats politicians</text>
  <text start="57.96" dur="5.79">are trying to impeach the president over</text>
  <text start="60.57" dur="5.369">alleged bad behavior with Ukraine when</text>
  <text start="63.75" dur="5.25">their own corrupt dealings with Ukraine</text>
  <text start="65.939" dur="5.311">are being exposed cuba&amp;#39;s talked a lot</text>
  <text start="69" dur="5.82">about projection what is projection</text>
  <text start="71.25" dur="6.509">well it&amp;#39;s accusing others are doing what</text>
  <text start="74.82" dur="6.18">you&amp;#39;re doing yourself alright this is on</text>
  <text start="77.759" dur="7.68">the 20th Q posted the Clinton Foundation</text>
  <text start="81" dur="8.36">and brackets quid pro quo internal alarm</text>
  <text start="85.439" dur="7.231">also in brackets how to frame and defend</text>
  <text start="89.36" dur="8.53">there&amp;#39;s a link to a WikiLeaks Podesta</text>
  <text start="92.67" dur="8.19">emails a chain of emails that we&amp;#39;ll look</text>
  <text start="97.89" dur="5.939">at here in just a second q said read</text>
  <text start="100.86" dur="5.759">carefully note but as to emails or</text>
  <text start="103.829" dur="5.07">non-public they were internal fact</text>
  <text start="106.619" dur="4.79">Ukraine is a single largest Clinton</text>
  <text start="108.899" dur="4.83">Foundation donor is that a coincidence I</text>
  <text start="111.409" dur="6.581">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a coincidence so if you</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="6.021">look at the email chain here this email</text>
  <text start="117.99" dur="3.69">chain was started by Jennifer Palmieri</text>
  <text start="119.75" dur="3.85">she thought it would might be a good</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="4.219">idea for Hillary to make a public</text>
  <text start="123.6" dur="4.62">statement setting the record straight</text>
  <text start="125.899" dur="5.56">insisting that she did not engage in</text>
  <text start="128.22" dur="5.46">quid pro quo as Secretary of State and</text>
  <text start="131.459" dur="2.581">then she wrote she could frame it this</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="2.49">way</text>
  <text start="134.04" dur="3.72">she&amp;#39;s got some talking points here that</text>
  <text start="136.17" dur="4.799">they&amp;#39;re very proud or she is very proud</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="6.479">of the Clinton Foundation work that if</text>
  <text start="140.969" dur="4.621">people donated people donate to the</text>
  <text start="144.239" dur="3.901">Clinton Foundation because they want to</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="4.59">support good work if anyone did give</text>
  <text start="148.14" dur="4.409">money in hopes of influencing something</text>
  <text start="150.18" dur="5.94">that State Department did they were</text>
  <text start="152.549" dur="6">foolish because she never did and never</text>
  <text start="156.12" dur="4.44">would Secretary of State makes</text>
  <text start="158.549" dur="3.511">life-and-death decisions and those kind</text>
  <text start="160.56" dur="4.079">of political considerations don&amp;#39;t come</text>
  <text start="162.06" dur="4.95">into play and then the fourth point was</text>
  <text start="164.639" dur="4.41">this at least that way she could have</text>
  <text start="167.01" dur="4.8">taken off the table any notion that</text>
  <text start="169.049" dur="4.62">there was quid pro quo even if some</text>
  <text start="171.81" dur="3.359">donors may have had bad intentions so</text>
  <text start="173.669" dur="4.52">they were just going through these</text>
  <text start="175.169" dur="6.091">different talking points in this email</text>
  <text start="178.189" dur="6.071">Robby Mook and John Podesta responded</text>
  <text start="181.26" dur="4.619">with their thoughts here on this they</text>
  <text start="184.26" dur="6.599">were wondering if it would be possible</text>
  <text start="185.879" dur="6.661">to have Hillary do a public speech where</text>
  <text start="190.859" dur="4.141">she would only receive one question and</text>
  <text start="192.54" dur="3.539">nothing more they were questioning they</text>
  <text start="195" dur="3.12">were wondering whether it would be a</text>
  <text start="196.079" dur="4.171">convincing message and also the timing</text>
  <text start="198.12" dur="3.6">of it because Bill Clinton was about to</text>
  <text start="200.25" dur="3.87">give a speech and they wanted to get it</text>
  <text start="201.72" dur="4.349">in before his speech if possible so this</text>
  <text start="204.12" dur="4.64">is all like I said in the WikiLeaks best</text>
  <text start="206.069" dur="5.551">emails all right</text>
  <text start="208.76" dur="4.27">so Democrats in the house are trying to</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="3.78">impeach the President on grounds that he</text>
  <text start="213.03" dur="4.109">requested that Ukraine investigate Joe</text>
  <text start="215.4" dur="5.669">Biden as a condition of receiving aid</text>
  <text start="217.139" dur="7.47">and that&amp;#39;s what this impeachment hearing</text>
  <text start="221.069" dur="6.721">and the house is all about now on my</text>
  <text start="224.609" dur="4.831">thread I posted a number of videos Sean</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="3.869">Hannity has been doing some updates he</text>
  <text start="229.44" dur="3.829">did a nice timeline of the of corruption</text>
  <text start="231.659" dur="5.3">I&amp;#39;m not going to go into any of this</text>
  <text start="233.269" dur="5.741">number one it&amp;#39;s not terribly relevant</text>
  <text start="236.959" dur="5.59">and number two I don&amp;#39;t want to get a</text>
  <text start="239.01" dur="6.42">copyright strike on my channel all right</text>
  <text start="242.549" dur="7.19">so a couple of things to note John</text>
  <text start="245.43" dur="6.989">Solomon did bring out some information</text>
  <text start="249.739" dur="5.051">in contrary to the claims of the</text>
  <text start="252.419" dur="4.261">mainstream media that the investigation</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="5.249">of burry smih Holdings a company that</text>

  <text start="267.98" dur="4.9">John Solomon has found out that the</text>
  <text start="270.45" dur="2.85">investigation into Brees mo was heating</text>
  <text start="272.88" dur="2.58">up</text>
  <text start="273.3" dur="5.55">that&amp;#39;s why Biden was pushing for the</text>
  <text start="275.46" dur="5.61">prosecutor to be fired again if you just</text>
  <text start="278.85" dur="3.81">go back and kind of follow what Hannity</text>

  <text start="536.73" dur="6.06">heads okay what does that mean well the</text>
  <text start="538.709" dur="6">day after the 2018 elections last year</text>
  <text start="542.79" dur="3.69">when people were grumbling and</text>
  <text start="544.709" dur="3.541">complaining because Republicans lost</text>
  <text start="546.48" dur="3">control of the house but they picked up</text>
  <text start="548.25" dur="4.41">a couple of seats in the Senate</text>
  <text start="549.48" dur="6.51">you said Senate was a target Corcoran</text>
  <text start="552.66" dur="5.19">flake removed two people who were never</text>

  <text start="559.92" dur="8.669">q how you catch a fish use bait Trump</text>
  <text start="565.589" dur="5.511">made it seem as if his goal was to keep</text>
  <text start="568.589" dur="5.461">the house that was an unrealistic goal</text>
  <text start="571.1" dur="5.799">people spent a lot of time trying to</text>
  <text start="574.05" dur="5.61">maintain control of the house the</text>
  <text start="576.899" dur="4.651">Democrats did but what Trump was</text>
  <text start="579.66" dur="4.469">actually trying to do was increase his</text>
  <text start="581.55" dur="4.38">majority in the Senate because the</text>
  <text start="584.129" dur="3.481">investigations that began in the house</text>
  <text start="585.93" dur="3.599">during the first two years of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="587.61" dur="4.289">term would be moved over to the Senate</text>
  <text start="589.529" dur="4.591">where the truth would be revealed so</text>
  <text start="591.899" dur="3.571">that&amp;#39;s what the Senate was a target</text>
  <text start="594.12" dur="2.969">means I don&amp;#39;t think it means anything</text>
  <text start="595.47" dur="4.679">more than that don&amp;#39;t have to read into</text>
  <text start="597.089" dur="5.971">it they were actually targeting an</text>
  <text start="600.149" dur="4.411">increase their majority in the Senate so</text>
  <text start="603.06" dur="2.85">they could move investigations into the</text>
  <text start="604.56" dur="3.99">Senate and now we&amp;#39;re gonna see some of</text>
  <text start="605.91" dur="4.14">that happening all right and I know a</text>
  <text start="608.55" dur="6.389">lot of people don&amp;#39;t trust Lindsey Graham</text>
  <text start="610.05" dur="7.229">and he flip-flops back and forth but if</text>
  <text start="614.939" dur="5.01">you go back to the cue drops from April</text>
  <text start="617.279" dur="5.31">of 2018 just go back and look at the cue</text>
  <text start="619.949" dur="4.471">drops from April 2018 you&amp;#39;ll find out</text>
  <text start="622.589" dur="5.55">that that is about the time and I think</text>
  <text start="624.42" dur="5.58">Lindsey Graham was flipped he was not</text>
  <text start="628.139" dur="4.711">cooperating with Trump prior to that</text>
  <text start="630" dur="6.48">time and afterward big change and I</text>
  <text start="632.85" dur="5.19">think Lindsey was given probably an</text>
  <text start="636.48" dur="4.169">opportunity to get on the right side of</text>
  <text start="638.04" dur="4.38">history I think I think things are gonna</text>
  <text start="640.649" dur="7.141">go okay in the Senate not were to worry</text>
  <text start="642.42" dur="8.43">about it all right q dropped a long post</text>
