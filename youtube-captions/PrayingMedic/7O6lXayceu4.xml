  <text start="21.71" dur="5.04">question and answer session that was</text>
  <text start="23.72" dur="5.1">recorded live on skype with the</text>
  <text start="26.75" dur="5.489">adventures and identity facebook group</text>

  <text start="38.39" dur="4.259">spirit and we even talked a little bit</text>
  <text start="40.07" dur="97.949">about angels I hope you enjoy this</text>
  <text start="42.649" dur="97.531">message from come from a slightly</text>
  <text start="138.019" dur="4.56">different belief system then P Cabrera</text>
  <text start="140.18" dur="5.67">and Corey Blake I&amp;#39;m just going to throw</text>
  <text start="142.579" dur="6.861">that out there right away they tend to</text>
  <text start="145.85" dur="4.74">teach that it is all about faith</text>
  <text start="149.44" dur="4.09">Authority</text>
  <text start="150.59" dur="4.44">and an unbelief and renewing your mind</text>
  <text start="153.53" dur="4.98">to the truth and those are really the</text>
  <text start="155.03" dur="6.569">only factors in the equation that they</text>
  <text start="158.51" dur="5.46">allow in which is fine</text>
  <text start="161.599" dur="3.961">they&amp;#39;re you know allowed to teach</text>
  <text start="163.97" dur="2.79">whatever they want to teach I have a</text>
  <text start="165.56" dur="4.709">slightly different revelation about</text>
  <text start="166.76" dur="8.699">healing God gave me some revelations</text>
  <text start="170.269" dur="7.921">specific to cancer and the issue that</text>
  <text start="175.459" dur="5.131">and and this is what my my online class</text>
  <text start="178.19" dur="4.79">gets down to teaching but I&amp;#39;ll give you</text>
  <text start="180.59" dur="5.42">kind of a brief summary of my</text>
  <text start="182.98" dur="6.52">understanding of power and authority and</text>
  <text start="186.01" dur="5.92">cancer and how different illnesses and</text>
  <text start="189.5" dur="6.209">conditions respond to different types of</text>
  <text start="191.93" dur="5.97">healing so people in the healing</text>
  <text start="195.709" dur="3.78">community tend to talk about power and</text>
  <text start="197.9" dur="4.23">authority but they never make a</text>
  <text start="199.489" dur="5.341">distinction over what is power</text>
  <text start="202.13" dur="5.52">what is authority and which conditions</text>
  <text start="204.83" dur="5.519">do you use power in which conditions do</text>
  <text start="207.65" dur="5.28">use Authority and why so we&amp;#39;re kind of</text>
  <text start="210.349" dur="4.17">told you know you just need to command</text>
  <text start="212.93" dur="3.48">that tumor to leave and you need to</text>
  <text start="214.519" dur="3.69">command this to happen and demand those</text>
  <text start="216.41" dur="3.78">bones to be healed and command this and</text>
  <text start="218.209" dur="5.431">command that take authority over stuff</text>
  <text start="220.19" dur="6.06">right well that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s okay except it</text>
  <text start="223.64" dur="6.179">doesn&amp;#39;t work all the time and it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="226.25" dur="5.64">actually address the differences between</text>
  <text start="229.819" dur="3.961">power and authority there are two</text>
  <text start="231.89" dur="4.83">completely different things</text>
  <text start="233.78" dur="7.829">they have different realities power is</text>
  <text start="236.72" dur="8.4">energy power is energy and energy is</text>
  <text start="241.609" dur="6.841">used to create things that don&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="245.12" dur="6.14">or it is used to create to bring dead</text>
  <text start="248.45" dur="2.81">things back to life</text>
  <text start="251.53" dur="7.06">authority is something you exercise and</text>
  <text start="255.799" dur="7.201">it generally is used to remove something</text>
  <text start="258.59" dur="6.96">that&amp;#39;s not supposed to be there so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="263" dur="4.56">two completely different dynamics if you</text>
  <text start="265.55" dur="4.2">have something in a person&amp;#39;s body that</text>
  <text start="267.56" dur="4.44">isn&amp;#39;t supposed to be there you would use</text>
  <text start="269.75" dur="5.31">the exercise authority and command it to</text>
  <text start="272" dur="6.389">leave you&amp;#39;re not using power because</text>
  <text start="275.06" dur="7.53">power is creative and it creates tissues</text>
  <text start="278.389" dur="5.051">that don&amp;#39;t exist or it brings life to</text>
  <text start="282.59" dur="4.6">dead</text>
  <text start="283.44" dur="8.76">shoes okay authority is used to command</text>
  <text start="287.19" dur="8.1">things to leave so if the person has a</text>
  <text start="292.2" dur="6.06">tumor for example that is not supposed</text>
  <text start="295.29" dur="5.13">to be there you&amp;#39;re going to exercise</text>
  <text start="298.26" dur="4.68">authority and you&amp;#39;re gonna make that</text>
  <text start="300.42" dur="4.86">tumor leave or you could exercise</text>
  <text start="302.94" dur="3.78">Authority and you could speak death to</text>
  <text start="305.28" dur="3.09">those tissues you can kill the tumor</text>
  <text start="306.72" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s one way to do it you can correct</text>
  <text start="308.37" dur="4.11">command the tumor to leave it&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="310.32" dur="4.95">way there are other ways but generally</text>
  <text start="312.48" dur="4.71">speaking with cancer and tumors it is an</text>
  <text start="315.27" dur="5.1">exercise of authority it has nothing to</text>
  <text start="317.19" dur="4.83">do with power you are trying to get rid</text>
  <text start="320.37" dur="5.67">of something that is not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="322.02" dur="6.6">there with something like a bacterial</text>
  <text start="326.04" dur="4.44">infection or a viral infection again</text>
  <text start="328.62" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s not supposed to be</text>
  <text start="330.48" dur="5.22">there so you command the bacteria to</text>
  <text start="332.79" dur="4.92">leave you command the virus to die your</text>
  <text start="335.7" dur="3.57">command you&amp;#39;re exercising Authority and</text>
  <text start="337.71" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;re killing or destroying or removing</text>
  <text start="339.27" dur="5.67">something that shouldn&amp;#39;t be there that</text>
  <text start="341.04" dur="6.45">is Authority now with power power is</text>
  <text start="344.94" dur="5.22">used to bring dead things back to life</text>
  <text start="347.49" dur="5.49">so I have a lot of quite a few friends</text>
  <text start="350.16" dur="4.32">who have neuropathy and their feet most</text>
  <text start="352.98" dur="3.689">of it&amp;#39;s due to diabetes but there other</text>
  <text start="354.48" dur="7.08">conditions the cosna APPA the-- your</text>
  <text start="356.669" dur="6.991">nerves start to die you don&amp;#39;t you if you</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="6.06">have dead nerves what those dead nerves</text>
  <text start="363.66" dur="6.36">need is they need a release of power to</text>
  <text start="367.62" dur="3.81">bring them back to life so when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="370.02" dur="4.649">praying for somebody for a neuropathy I</text>
  <text start="371.43" dur="6.03">am releasing power I&amp;#39;m not exercising</text>
  <text start="374.669" dur="5.911">Authority if I am praying for someone</text>
  <text start="377.46" dur="5.34">who needs a new eardrum a new I and new</text>
  <text start="380.58" dur="4.41">kidney because the one they have is</text>
  <text start="382.8" dur="5.46">damaged or it&amp;#39;s missing I&amp;#39;m gonna do a</text>
  <text start="384.99" dur="6.87">creative miracle miracles are done with</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="5.76">power so you have to look at your</text>
  <text start="391.86" dur="4.68">situation and ask yourself what do I</text>
  <text start="394.02" dur="4.11">need to do here am i removing something</text>
  <text start="396.54" dur="4.52">this sin supposed to be there or am i</text>
  <text start="398.13" dur="5.789">creating something that doesn&amp;#39;t exist</text>
  <text start="401.06" dur="8.07">two different dynamics one is power one</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="5.211">is Authority now getting down to cancer</text>
  <text start="411.41" dur="5.99">the this the success that I&amp;#39;ve had with</text>
  <text start="414.36" dur="5.68">cancer almost</text>
  <text start="417.4" dur="5.28">exclusively is because I&amp;#39;ve learned how</text>
  <text start="420.04" dur="3.96">to exercise authority I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="422.68" dur="4.17">ever seen anyone healed of cancer using</text>
  <text start="424" dur="5.58">power it&amp;#39;s always Authority and what the</text>
  <text start="426.85" dur="6.15">Lord showed me years ago and this is not</text>
  <text start="429.58" dur="5.48">like a silver bullet for cancer but it</text>
  <text start="433" dur="4.41">is something that does work pretty well</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="3.609">norm what most of the time when I prayed</text>
  <text start="437.41" dur="3.3">for cancer and I pray for a lot of</text>
  <text start="438.669" dur="4.62">cancer patients through email and</text>
  <text start="440.71" dur="5.64">private messages most of the time when I</text>
  <text start="443.289" dur="6.301">pray for cancer that close my eyes the</text>
  <text start="446.35" dur="5.67">Lord shows me a throne when he shows me</text>
  <text start="449.59" dur="7.35">a throne I have learned what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="452.02" dur="7.459">telling me is you need to approach this</text>
  <text start="456.94" dur="4.86">situation as if you are a king</text>
  <text start="459.479" dur="4.871">all right you are seated in heavenly</text>
  <text start="461.8" dur="5.82">places on a throne that is a place of</text>
  <text start="464.35" dur="4.999">authority and you are like a king and</text>
  <text start="467.62" dur="5.07">what you need to do is make a decree</text>
  <text start="469.349" dur="7.54">like a king would make a decree you need</text>
  <text start="472.69" dur="7.53">to decrease something that is not as if</text>
  <text start="476.889" dur="5.221">it will be all right so what the Lord</text>
  <text start="480.22" dur="6.39">has had me do many times is just make a</text>
  <text start="482.11" dur="8.309">simple decree that and and what I in my</text>
  <text start="486.61" dur="6.21">mind in my spirit my spirit is sitting</text>
  <text start="490.419" dur="4.381">on that throne in heaven okay and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="492.82" dur="3.96">not making the decree from Earth I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="494.8" dur="5.369">making the decree from heaven where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="496.78" dur="5.24">seated with Jesus in heaven my spirit is</text>
  <text start="500.169" dur="4.351">there and I am making a heavenly decree</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="4.81">that that person when they go to their</text>
  <text start="504.52" dur="3.75">next appointment is not going to have</text>
  <text start="506.83" dur="4.019">cancer the tumor will be gone that</text>
  <text start="508.27" dur="5.28">doctors are gonna find nothing on the</text>
  <text start="510.849" dur="5.341">scans it&amp;#39;s been surprising how many</text>
  <text start="513.55" dur="5.22">times when I have when I obey the Lord</text>
  <text start="516.19" dur="5.64">and he shows me a throne and I take my</text>
  <text start="518.77" dur="6">place of authority and make that decree</text>
  <text start="521.83" dur="4.5">many times I the person has gotten back</text>
  <text start="524.77" dur="3.21">to me and said you&amp;#39;re not gonna believe</text>
  <text start="526.33" dur="3.33">it I went to the doctor and they did a</text>
  <text start="527.98" dur="8.04">scan and they didn&amp;#39;t find the tumor it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="529.66" dur="7.86">gone this this is not a formula to be to</text>
  <text start="536.02" dur="4.439">be followed every single time we have</text>
  <text start="537.52" dur="5.819">someone who has cancer it is one</text>
  <text start="540.459" dur="5.311">approach that the Lord has shown me that</text>
  <text start="543.339" dur="5.341">seems to work pretty well if he shows me</text>
  <text start="545.77" dur="4.62">a throne he is leading me and showing me</text>
  <text start="548.68" dur="3.48">this is how I wanted to do it</text>
  <text start="550.39" dur="3.99">particular time it doesn&amp;#39;t always happen</text>
  <text start="552.16" dur="3.9">that way there are other ways in which</text>
  <text start="554.38" dur="4.92">he has had me pray for people for cancer</text>
  <text start="556.06" dur="17.52">but that is by far the most common way</text>
  <text start="559.3" dur="22.71">he has me pray for cancer okay yeah so</text>
  <text start="573.58" dur="11.37">his PET scan came back clean right so if</text>
  <text start="582.01" dur="5.7">his PET scan came back clean and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="584.95" dur="5.3">done with chemo what you don&amp;#39;t want is</text>
  <text start="587.71" dur="6.63">you don&amp;#39;t want it to come back right</text>
  <text start="590.25" dur="8.89">okay and and I hate to cop out here but</text>
  <text start="594.34" dur="8.01">it&amp;#39;s not a cop-out this is how I do</text>
  <text start="599.14" dur="5.25">healing I asked the Holy Spirit what do</text>
  <text start="602.35" dur="4.8">you want me to do how do you want me to</text>
  <text start="604.39" dur="5.31">pray am I going to command and just make</text>
  <text start="607.15" dur="5.19">a decree that that this tumor this kind</text>
  <text start="609.7" dur="4.62">of cancer will never come back do you</text>
  <text start="612.34" dur="3.69">want me to walk this person through some</text>
  <text start="614.32" dur="4.77">kind of emotional healing is there</text>
  <text start="616.03" dur="5.73">something else that I need to do you</text>
  <text start="619.09" dur="5.04">know Jesus Jesus said the son does</text>
  <text start="621.76" dur="6.09">nothing of himself but only what he sees</text>
  <text start="624.13" dur="6.87">the father doing and healing now this is</text>
  <text start="627.85" dur="4.89">where I disagree with curry Blake curry</text>
  <text start="631" dur="4.56">teaches that healing is a mechanical</text>
  <text start="632.74" dur="5.07">process that you simply exercise faith</text>
  <text start="635.56" dur="6.6">you have no doubt no unbelief in your</text>
  <text start="637.81" dur="6.6">mind you exercise faith and you know</text>
  <text start="642.16" dur="3.78">your authority and it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s a simple</text>
  <text start="644.41" dur="4.08">transaction it&amp;#39;s a process might</text>
  <text start="645.94" dur="4.2">mechanical process and is not relational</text>
  <text start="648.49" dur="3.51">it doesn&amp;#39;t require you to do anything</text>
  <text start="650.14" dur="5.34">else you just simply you either have</text>
  <text start="652" dur="7.08">faith or you don&amp;#39;t and if you do the</text>
  <text start="655.48" dur="7.08">person will be healed well I take</text>
  <text start="659.08" dur="7.23">exception to that approach because for</text>
  <text start="662.56" dur="6.33">me it always works out best when I when</text>
  <text start="666.31" dur="6.03">I look at it as a relationship I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="668.89" dur="5.01">always asking the Holy Spirit how do you</text>
  <text start="672.34" dur="4.41">want to deal with this particular</text>
  <text start="673.9" dur="5.73">situation what is it that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="5.81">we&amp;#39;re trying to accomplish here and how</text>
  <text start="679.63" dur="4.5">do you want me to do it so sometimes</text>
  <text start="682.56" dur="3.37">he&amp;#39;ll tell me</text>
  <text start="684.13" dur="5.7">the person needs emotional healing they</text>
  <text start="685.93" dur="5.81">have this you know these soul wounds</text>
  <text start="689.83" dur="4.29">that need to be healed go for that first</text>
  <text start="691.74" dur="4.57">good example I pray to the woman one</text>
  <text start="694.12" dur="4.05">time who had been in multiple car</text>
  <text start="696.31" dur="4.53">accidents had horrible chronic neck and</text>
  <text start="698.17" dur="6.21">back pain and receive prayer from a lot</text>
  <text start="700.84" dur="6.15">of different people wasn&amp;#39;t healed I got</text>
  <text start="704.38" dur="4.56">her we sat down on a couch and I was</text>
  <text start="706.99" dur="3.96">talking to her and the Holy Spirit said</text>
  <text start="708.94" dur="4.49">look she needs emotional healing so I</text>
  <text start="710.95" dur="5.19">took her through this process she had</text>
  <text start="713.43" dur="5.95">lots and lots of anger and unforgiveness</text>
  <text start="716.14" dur="4.91">toward her husband her two ex-husbands</text>
  <text start="719.38" dur="3.81">and her father</text>
  <text start="721.05" dur="6.16">we took her through the process of</text>
  <text start="723.19" dur="6.72">emotional healing I did and she got</text>
  <text start="727.21" dur="4.11">healed of the anger from her two</text>
  <text start="729.91" dur="3.9">ex-husbands who were very abusive and</text>
  <text start="731.32" dur="3.99">her father who was also abusive and when</text>
  <text start="733.81" dur="4.98">we were done all of her back pain and</text>
  <text start="735.31" dur="5.82">neck pain was gone it wasn&amp;#39;t her</text>
  <text start="738.79" dur="5.52">condition was related to emotional</text>
  <text start="741.13" dur="5.52">trauma not she had had she had many</text>
  <text start="744.31" dur="4.97">x-rays after her car accidents and the</text>
  <text start="746.65" dur="5.1">x-rays were normal she didn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="749.28" dur="5.11">structural abnormalities in her back or</text>
  <text start="751.75" dur="5.07">spine she had emotional trauma that</text>
  <text start="754.39" dur="4.23">needed to be healed and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="756.82" dur="4.17">allow for those things if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="758.62" dur="4.32">allow the Holy Spirit to show you the</text>
  <text start="760.99" dur="3.69">different things that a person needs</text>

  <text start="887.65" dur="5.33">they can smell the aroma of demons so</text>
  <text start="890.26" dur="6.12">and the thing is they can all be</text>
  <text start="892.98" dur="6.34">exorcised and sharpened if you don&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="896.38" dur="4.44">in the spirit you can that I wrote a</text>
  <text start="899.32" dur="3.66">book I&amp;#39;m singing in the spirit made</text>

  <text start="914.44" dur="5.22">have to do the exercises you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="917.17" dur="4.59">really reading the books is good but</text>
  <text start="919.66" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s just like it&amp;#39;s just like healing if</text>

  <text start="928.6" dur="4.83">saying in the spirit if you don&amp;#39;t spend</text>
  <text start="930.7" dur="6.15">some time engaging the spiritual world</text>

  <text start="973.36" dur="7.98">subject if you let me faith is one of my</text>
  <text start="978.91" dur="4.17">favorite subjects to teach on because</text>
  <text start="981.34" dur="5.79">probably it&amp;#39;s one of the most</text>
  <text start="983.08" dur="6.96">misunderstood in the church a lot of</text>
  <text start="987.13" dur="4.44">people talk about faith but very few</text>
  <text start="990.04" dur="5.13">people actually sit down and describe</text>
  <text start="991.57" dur="7.68">and analyze what is faith what is it</text>
  <text start="995.17" dur="6.78">really when you talk about faith so the</text>
  <text start="999.25" dur="5.55">Lord gave me an illustration to use to</text>
  <text start="1001.95" dur="7.37">help people understand faith imagine if</text>
  <text start="1004.8" dur="8.97">you were standing on the top of a rocky</text>
  <text start="1009.32" dur="6.28">ledge and in front of you there is a gap</text>
  <text start="1013.77" dur="4.38">between the legend you were standing on</text>
  <text start="1015.6" dur="4.26">and the next rock that was in front of</text>
  <text start="1018.15" dur="4.86">you and let&amp;#39;s say it was three feet away</text>
  <text start="1019.86" dur="4.98">the the gap was three feet and I asked</text>
  <text start="1023.01" dur="3.99">you could you jump over to that next</text>
  <text start="1024.84" dur="4.56">Rock could you jump that gap of three</text>
  <text start="1027" dur="4.77">feet you would probably look at that gap</text>
  <text start="1029.4" dur="5.85">and go yeah I can jump that that&amp;#39;s easy</text>
  <text start="1031.77" dur="6.3">you have a lot of confidence that you</text>
  <text start="1035.25" dur="5.34">could jump a gap that&amp;#39;s three feet okay</text>
  <text start="1038.07" dur="5.24">now let&amp;#39;s imagine that the gap between</text>
  <text start="1040.59" dur="5.76">the rocks was five feet and I asked you</text>
  <text start="1043.31" dur="6.13">would you be able to make that distance</text>
  <text start="1046.35" dur="6.33">that jump and you would probably not be</text>
  <text start="1049.44" dur="7.23">as confident you might say well I think</text>
  <text start="1052.68" dur="6.54">I can I&amp;#39;m not sure then let&amp;#39;s say that</text>
  <text start="1056.67" dur="6">the gap between the rocks was 12 feet</text>
  <text start="1059.22" dur="4.86">and I said hey would you be able to jump</text>
  <text start="1062.67" dur="3.3">from this rock to that one if the gap</text>
  <text start="1064.08" dur="4.07">between them was 12 feet you would</text>
  <text start="1065.97" dur="5.07">probably not have as much confidence you</text>
  <text start="1068.15" dur="8.7">would probably not have as much faith</text>
  <text start="1071.04" dur="9.45">that you could make that jump faith is</text>
  <text start="1076.85" dur="7.029">really it is very similar to confidence</text>
  <text start="1080.49" dur="7.889">it is an evaluation in your mind</text>
  <text start="1083.879" dur="7.8">how likely is this to actually happen if</text>
  <text start="1088.379" dur="6.09">I if I do this am I going to be</text>
  <text start="1091.679" dur="5.46">successful your your measure of</text>
  <text start="1094.469" dur="5.78">confidence in whether it&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1097.139" dur="7.68">going to happen is the measure of faith</text>
  <text start="1100.249" dur="5.92">okay so if you walk up to a stranger in</text>
  <text start="1104.819" dur="5.09">the grocery store who has a frozen</text>

  <text start="1118.139" dur="5.76">pray for you what is your confidence</text>

  <text start="1493.63" dur="5.56">bla bla bla I hid your talent here it is</text>
  <text start="1497.06" dur="3.42">and he said well you could have at least</text>
  <text start="1499.19" dur="3.93">put it in the bank and gotten interest</text>
  <text start="1500.48" dur="3.63">so he took it away from him he rebuked</text>
  <text start="1503.12" dur="6">him and he gave it to the one who had</text>
  <text start="1504.11" dur="9.27">five so interesting here is Jesus takes</text>
  <text start="1509.12" dur="6.99">away what was given to one and gives it</text>
  <text start="1513.38" dur="5.64">to another different people have</text>
  <text start="1516.11" dur="6.6">different levels of authority different</text>
  <text start="1519.02" dur="5.37">spheres metrans authority I was reading</text>
  <text start="1522.71" dur="4.38">a book by James gall and dream</text>
  <text start="1524.39" dur="4.32">interpretation and I was reading this</text>
  <text start="1527.09" dur="3.42">chapter where James gall was talking</text>
  <text start="1528.71" dur="5.07">about your Metron your sphere of</text>
  <text start="1530.51" dur="4.8">influence and authority I had never</text>
  <text start="1533.78" dur="5.22">heard that before and this is years ago</text>
  <text start="1535.31" dur="6.81">that night an angel appeared in my room</text>
  <text start="1539" dur="5.04">and told me your sphere of authority</text>
  <text start="1542.12" dur="6.12">oh no he said your level of authority is</text>
  <text start="1544.04" dur="8.58">increasing so because I was starting to</text>
  <text start="1548.24" dur="7.62">step out in healing and deliverance God</text>
  <text start="1552.62" dur="6.96">was increasing my level of authority he</text>
  <text start="1555.86" dur="7.44">was increasing my sphere my Metron so it</text>
  <text start="1559.58" dur="6.9">is true that we all start out with a</text>
  <text start="1563.3" dur="6.84">relatively small level of authority but</text>
  <text start="1566.48" dur="7.1">it is also true as we are faithful as we</text>
  <text start="1570.14" dur="6.62">exercise our authority faithfully in</text>
  <text start="1573.58" dur="6.43">accordance with the will of God he</text>
  <text start="1576.76" dur="6.34">increases our Authority Authority is one</text>
  <text start="1580.01" dur="7.59">of the things in the kingdom that is</text>
  <text start="1583.1" dur="7.19">again it&amp;#39;s relational your level of</text>
  <text start="1587.6" dur="7.14">authority is directly proportional to</text>
  <text start="1590.29" dur="7.6">your intimacy with the Lord the more</text>
  <text start="1594.74" dur="5.16">intimacy you have with God the more time</text>
  <text start="1597.89" dur="4.44">you spend with God the more you</text>
  <text start="1599.9" dur="4.56">understand about your calling and your</text>
  <text start="1602.33" dur="4.41">gifting and your assignments and the</text>
  <text start="1604.46" dur="5.19">more you are faithfully following those</text>
  <text start="1606.74" dur="6.29">assignments he is going to give you more</text>
  <text start="1609.65" dur="7.8">assignments more authority greater</text>
  <text start="1613.03" dur="4.83">ability to bring his kingdom into effect</text>
  <text start="1617.45" dur="3.97">in the</text>
  <text start="1617.86" dur="9.54">world so again it&amp;#39;s a relational thing I</text>
  <text start="1621.42" dur="11.28">know people who have large spheres of</text>
  <text start="1627.4" dur="9.05">authority in as it pertains to</text>
  <text start="1632.7" dur="7.06">territories I know people who are</text>
  <text start="1636.45" dur="7.03">apostolic leaders who have great spheres</text>
  <text start="1639.76" dur="6.299">of authority over large geographic areas</text>
  <text start="1643.48" dur="4.43">that comes from faithfully stewarding</text>
  <text start="1646.059" dur="4.681">the authority that God has given them</text>
  <text start="1647.91" dur="5.74">whether it&amp;#39;s apostolic or prophetic or</text>
  <text start="1650.74" dur="8.179">whether it&amp;#39;s healing as you are faithful</text>
  <text start="1653.65" dur="10.44">God gives you more I think it is good to</text>
  <text start="1658.919" dur="7.121">be mindful of what your authority allows</text>
  <text start="1664.09" dur="4.8">you to do and what it does not allow you</text>
  <text start="1666.04" dur="5.43">to do I had a vision as I was going to</text>
  <text start="1668.89" dur="5.01">sleep a couple years ago I saw this eye</text>
  <text start="1671.47" dur="6.6">it looked like a Dre at the eye of a</text>
  <text start="1673.9" dur="6.72">large dragon and I had my eyes closed</text>
  <text start="1678.07" dur="6.93">going to sleep I saw this large dragon</text>
  <text start="1680.62" dur="6.299">eye and I started to rebuke and try to</text>
  <text start="1685" dur="4.71">exercise authority over that thing I</text>
  <text start="1686.919" dur="7.411">knew it was a demonic entity of some</text>
  <text start="1689.71" dur="7.8">kind and then I got this cold shiver in</text>
  <text start="1694.33" dur="4.77">my body and I thought wow you know what</text>
  <text start="1697.51" dur="3.96">I think I may be going up against</text>
  <text start="1699.1" dur="5.25">something that&amp;#39;s outside of my authority</text>
  <text start="1701.47" dur="7.02">I don&amp;#39;t think I had authority at that</text>
  <text start="1704.35" dur="6.12">time to take on that demonic being so I</text>
  <text start="1708.49" dur="5.67">closed my mouth and I ignored it and I</text>
  <text start="1710.47" dur="5.67">left it alone now I have I have friends</text>
  <text start="1714.16" dur="3.53">who do a lot of spiritual warfare I</text>
  <text start="1716.14" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t do a lot of spiritual warfare</text>
  <text start="1717.69" dur="7.359">thank God it&amp;#39;s not my calling but I</text>
  <text start="1721.21" dur="5.19">think you can get into areas of dealing</text>
  <text start="1725.049" dur="3.75">with especially with principalities</text>
  <text start="1726.4" dur="3.899">where you may very quickly get in over</text>
  <text start="1728.799" dur="3.891">your head and you are outside of your</text>
  <text start="1730.299" dur="4.471">sphere of authority and some people</text>
  <text start="1732.69" dur="3.16">prefer to believe they have authority</text>
  <text start="1734.77" dur="3.18">over everything</text>
  <text start="1735.85" dur="3.69">I think that&amp;#39;s being Cavalier and</text>
  <text start="1737.95" dur="5.39">reckless and I think it&amp;#39;s a really good</text>
  <text start="1739.54" dur="7.769">way to get hammered by the enemy I try</text>
  <text start="1743.34" dur="7.02">to confine my teaching and my ministry</text>
  <text start="1747.309" dur="4.711">to the things that God has given me</text>
  <text start="1750.36" dur="5.14">clearly a sign</text>
  <text start="1752.02" dur="6.35">to me as things that are within my realm</text>
  <text start="1755.5" dur="35.58">my spirit</text>
  <text start="1758.37" dur="35.91">okay that&amp;#39;s a really good question when</text>
  <text start="1791.08" dur="6.81">you start out doing ministry to people</text>
  <text start="1794.28" dur="7.21">it is very easy to get drawn into having</text>
  <text start="1797.89" dur="7.07">this emotional you know fondness for</text>
  <text start="1801.49" dur="5.67">them you can even start to have you know</text>
  <text start="1804.96" dur="5.2">sexual feelings for somebody that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1807.16" dur="4.47">ministering to when you&amp;#39;re young in the</text>
  <text start="1810.16" dur="4.64">Lord when you&amp;#39;re start out doing</text>
  <text start="1811.63" dur="6.09">ministry it is it is very easy to get</text>
  <text start="1814.8" dur="6.55">drawn into those types of emotions those</text>
  <text start="1817.72" dur="6.15">feelings of relationships especially if</text>
  <text start="1821.35" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re not mature spiritually mature and</text>
  <text start="1823.87" dur="4.95">especially if you are emotionally</text>
  <text start="1826.21" dur="8.15">wounded I think people that are subject</text>
  <text start="1828.82" dur="10.05">to soul ties or unhealthy emotional</text>
  <text start="1834.36" dur="6.64">relationships are they&amp;#39;re predisposed to</text>
  <text start="1838.87" dur="5.58">that because they have emotional needs</text>
  <text start="1841" dur="5.25">that are not met some of that is because</text>
  <text start="1844.45" dur="4.32">they have unhealthy relationships the</text>
  <text start="1846.25" dur="5.25">other part of it is I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="1848.77" dur="4.53">them probably have emotional wounds that</text>
  <text start="1851.5" dur="2.94">have not been healed and if you have</text>
  <text start="1853.3" dur="6.66">emotional wounds that haven&amp;#39;t been</text>
  <text start="1854.44" dur="8.46">healed you have wounded parts of your</text>
  <text start="1859.96" dur="5.91">soul that will come up and sort of take</text>
  <text start="1862.9" dur="5.3">over your personality then I&amp;#39;ll take</text>
  <text start="1865.87" dur="6.66">over your behaviors and thoughts and</text>
  <text start="1868.2" dur="7.06">many times a person who is normally in</text>
  <text start="1872.53" dur="5.88">control of their emotions and their</text>
  <text start="1875.26" dur="6.54">thoughts in most situations will have</text>
  <text start="1878.41" dur="6.06">this one strange area of weakness where</text>
  <text start="1881.8" dur="3.69">they do this one certain thing and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1884.47" dur="1.43">almost like they become a different</text>
  <text start="1885.49" dur="3.74">person</text>
  <text start="1885.9" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s like they&amp;#39;re an irresponsible 11 or</text>
  <text start="1889.23" dur="3.84">12 year old for a while and then they</text>
  <text start="1891.72" dur="2.4">kind of come to their senses and then</text>
  <text start="1893.07" dur="2.67">come back to being normal</text>
  <text start="1894.12" dur="4.29">well when you see that kind of behavior</text>
  <text start="1895.74" dur="5.61">when you see a normal adult rational</text>
  <text start="1898.41" dur="5.79">person suddenly becoming emotionally</text>
  <text start="1901.35" dur="4.62">involved in in a in a situation where</text>
  <text start="1904.2" dur="3.87">they wouldn&amp;#39;t normally do that what</text>
  <text start="1905.97" dur="4.73">you&amp;#39;re probably seeing is a soul wound</text>
  <text start="1908.07" dur="5.34">what we call those altars and fragments</text>
  <text start="1910.7" dur="4.359">that will come up and take over your</text>
  <text start="1913.41" dur="5.37">personality because they&amp;#39;re being</text>
  <text start="1915.059" dur="5.611">triggered by a situation that is similar</text>
  <text start="1918.78" dur="4.8">to the one that caused them years ago</text>
  <text start="1920.67" dur="5.19">and those altars and fragments can take</text>
  <text start="1923.58" dur="3.93">over your personality and they can get</text>
  <text start="1925.86" dur="3.9">you in trouble they can get you into</text>
  <text start="1927.51" dur="3.72">very bad relationships they can say</text>
  <text start="1929.76" dur="3.99">things that you really didn&amp;#39;t mean to</text>
  <text start="1931.23" dur="5.61">say they can do things that you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1933.75" dur="4.77">mean to do because yeah and and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1936.84" dur="5.19">we&amp;#39;re not talking about multiple</text>
  <text start="1938.52" dur="5.07">personalities essentially although the</text>
  <text start="1942.03" dur="4.17">same dynamic does cause multiple</text>
  <text start="1943.59" dur="9.78">personalities but most people have a</text>
  <text start="1946.2" dur="9.81">very subtle form of you could call it a</text>
  <text start="1953.37" dur="4.59">mental illness if you want to but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1956.01" dur="5.669">just they had these most of us have</text>
  <text start="1957.96" dur="5.57">these wounded parts of our soul we</text>
  <text start="1961.679" dur="4.621">couldn&amp;#39;t I said altars and fragments and</text>
  <text start="1963.53" dur="7.96">they caused a lot of confusion and they</text>
  <text start="1966.3" dur="7.74">caused a lot of problems so that&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="1971.49" dur="5.37">think if you&amp;#39;re having issues with soul</text>
  <text start="1974.04" dur="5.4">ties with getting on an unhealthy</text>
  <text start="1976.86" dur="4.8">connection to somebody in ministry you</text>
  <text start="1979.44" dur="18.81">probably need to first look at getting</text>
  <text start="1981.66" dur="21.39">some emotional healing yes they can be</text>
  <text start="1998.25" dur="7.77">they can be and if you have not read</text>
  <text start="2003.05" dur="5.4">Anna Mendes Farrell&amp;#39;s book regions of</text>

  <text start="2026.11" dur="6.16">I&amp;#39;ll tell you once you start going down</text>
  <text start="2029.84" dur="5.67">that rabbit hole I think it gets deep</text>
  <text start="2032.27" dur="6.93">very quickly but the inner world I call</text>

  <text start="2067.88" dur="5.46">identify the personalities of these</text>
  <text start="2070.13" dur="6">wounded parts of the soul when you talk</text>
  <text start="2073.34" dur="4.88">about altars and fragments altars is a</text>
  <text start="2076.13" dur="6.89">term used for alternate personalities</text>
  <text start="2078.22" dur="7.24">altars generally have a well-defined</text>

  <text start="2143.09" dur="4.91">and that is has become an interest</text>
  <text start="2144.92" dur="8.14">subject of great interest to me because</text>
  <text start="2148" dur="7.34">most of us who are interested in healing</text>
  <text start="2153.06" dur="3.93">you run into this wall where you get</text>

  <text start="2231.72" dur="5.97">could talk for hours about the occult</text>
  <text start="2234.08" dur="4.15">witchcraft curses and spells and things</text>
  <text start="2237.69" dur="4.71">of that nature</text>
  <text start="2238.23" dur="5.88">some people just their ministry really</text>
  <text start="2242.4" dur="5.22">is kind of centered around the occult</text>

  <text start="2254.43" dur="3.78">not my area of specialization and I</text>
  <text start="2256.41" dur="4.05">often refer those people out to somebody</text>
  <text start="2258.21" dur="2.7">who has more expertise and knowledge</text>
  <text start="2260.46" dur="5.01">than I do</text>

  <text start="2338.4" dur="3.209">really know what I was doing from a</text>
  <text start="2339.84" dur="4.23">prayer perspective so I was just praying</text>
  <text start="2341.609" dur="4.891">you know to break these spells off and</text>
  <text start="2344.07" dur="3.78">praying that the witchcraft curses would</text>
  <text start="2346.5" dur="5.04">be broken and all that stuff you know</text>
  <text start="2347.85" dur="5.99">what normally people normally pray as</text>
  <text start="2351.54" dur="5.79">soon as I started doing that I suffered</text>
  <text start="2353.84" dur="6.13">dizziness every time i would lay down or</text>

  <text start="2379.32" dur="5.58">basically they created curate created</text>
  <text start="2382.29" dur="5.16">these witchcraft curses where if anyone</text>
  <text start="2384.9" dur="4.41">is praying against them they&amp;#39;ll get this</text>
  <text start="2387.45" dur="3.84">witchcraft curse and usually it</text>
  <text start="2389.31" dur="7.16">manifests as dizziness or nausea or</text>
  <text start="2391.29" dur="7.2">disorientation so if you are not</text>
  <text start="2396.47" dur="3.31">well-versed and if you&amp;#39;re not under the</text>

  <text start="2404.28" dur="3.66">want to have happen to you that is why I</text>
  <text start="2406.26" dur="3.66">tend to stay away from that stuff</text>
  <text start="2407.94" dur="4.59">because it really isn&amp;#39;t something that</text>
  <text start="2409.92" dur="4.8">the Lord has called me to do if he has</text>
  <text start="2412.53" dur="4.5">called you to do it great learn about it</text>
  <text start="2414.72" dur="5.75">and be careful but the Lord hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2417.03" dur="7.44">really called me to do a whole lot</text>
  <text start="2420.47" dur="6.52">that involves the occult and like I said</text>
  <text start="2424.47" dur="56.31">I&amp;#39;m grateful that he hasn&amp;#39;t because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2426.99" dur="55.38">it&amp;#39;s not exactly well there&amp;#39;s standing</text>
  <text start="2480.78" dur="4.61">on the scripture and then there&amp;#39;s being</text>
  <text start="2482.37" dur="7.44">obedient to what God has asked you to do</text>
  <text start="2485.39" dur="6.97">if if you are if you&amp;#39;re involved in</text>
  <text start="2489.81" dur="6.21">things that God has not asked you to be</text>

  <text start="2502.05" dur="7.17">you are out of alignment with your</text>
  <text start="2506.1" dur="4.92">heavenly assignment it&amp;#39;s great it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2509.22" dur="4.02">great to stand on the Word of God that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2511.02" dur="4.35">great it&amp;#39;s better to be obedient to the</text>
  <text start="2513.24" dur="3.72">Holy Spirit and to do the things he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2515.37" dur="3.23">asked you to do and to not be involved</text>
  <text start="2516.96" dur="6.09">in the things he has not asked you to do</text>
  <text start="2518.6" dur="8.95">one of the things that I think a lot of</text>
  <text start="2523.05" dur="6.96">people have trouble with is saying no or</text>
  <text start="2527.55" dur="5.9">saying I don&amp;#39;t know I get a lot of</text>
  <text start="2530.01" dur="6.06">questions from people about things like</text>
  <text start="2533.45" dur="5.38">generational curses and you know</text>
  <text start="2536.07" dur="3.96">Freemasonry on witchcraft and generally</text>
  <text start="2538.83" dur="2.49">when people ask me these questions days</text>
  <text start="2540.03" dur="4.23">tell them I don&amp;#39;t have any revelation</text>
  <text start="2541.32" dur="3.45">from God on that and that&amp;#39;s it end of</text>
  <text start="2544.26" dur="4.44">discussion</text>
  <text start="2544.77" dur="5.76">because that&amp;#39;s the truth it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2548.7" dur="4.56">not something God has taught me a whole</text>
  <text start="2550.53" dur="4.8">lot about he I I have had hundreds of</text>
  <text start="2553.26" dur="4.56">dreams about healing over the last eight</text>
  <text start="2555.33" dur="4.74">years I haven&amp;#39;t had one dream or</text>
  <text start="2557.82" dur="5.43">revelation from God about generational</text>
  <text start="2560.07" dur="5.34">curses or bloodline curses or any of</text>
  <text start="2563.25" dur="4.44">that stuff I have friends who can talk</text>
  <text start="2565.41" dur="3.93">about that stuff for days that&amp;#39;s their</text>
  <text start="2567.69" dur="2.82">thing and they&amp;#39;re very good at it</text>
  <text start="2569.34" dur="2.49">they&amp;#39;re very knowledgeable and they know</text>
  <text start="2570.51" dur="4.68">what they&amp;#39;re doing I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2571.83" dur="6.15">so when whenever it comes down to</text>
  <text start="2575.19" dur="6.9">something like that I realize there is a</text>
  <text start="2577.98" dur="5.4">border there&amp;#39;s a there is a I am if I</text>
  <text start="2582.09" dur="4.35">start to get into this stuff I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2583.38" dur="7.05">stepping outside my sphere of authority</text>
  <text start="2586.44" dur="6.42">I have not been authorized to go and do</text>
  <text start="2590.43" dur="4.02">that kind of ministry and you know I</text>
  <text start="2592.86" dur="3.45">could say well I&amp;#39;m standing on the Word</text>
  <text start="2594.45" dur="4.29">of God I have authority over you know</text>
  <text start="2596.31" dur="3.48">all the powers of darkness well that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2598.74" dur="4.05">fine but</text>
  <text start="2599.79" dur="5.49">authority only extends as far as God has</text>
  <text start="2602.79" dur="4.38">given you Authority he&amp;#39;s given us</text>
  <text start="2605.28" dur="5.01">authority to do certain things and not</text>
  <text start="2607.17" dur="4.95">other things I don&amp;#39;t teach on a lot of</text>
  <text start="2610.29" dur="4.38">subjects that God has not given me</text>
  <text start="2612.12" dur="4.44">revelation authority on I could if I</text>
  <text start="2614.67" dur="3.66">wanted to I could exercise my freewill</text>
  <text start="2616.56" dur="4.8">and say I&amp;#39;m gonna teach on this subject</text>
  <text start="2618.33" dur="4.53">but I know what the Lord has authorized</text>
  <text start="2621.36" dur="3.99">me to teach on and what he has not</text>
  <text start="2622.86" dur="4.11">authorized me to teach on and if it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2625.35" dur="4.14">subject that he has not authorized me to</text>
  <text start="2626.97" dur="5.43">teach on or do ministry on I don&amp;#39;t go</text>
  <text start="2629.49" dur="6.6">there because I&amp;#39;m not authorized and</text>
  <text start="2632.4" dur="7.41">your your authority only extends as far</text>
  <text start="2636.09" dur="5.67">as God&amp;#39;s has the sphere that God has</text>
  <text start="2639.81" dur="3.54">given you if you go outside of that you</text>
  <text start="2641.76" dur="5.13">are outside of your you&amp;#39;re outside of</text>
  <text start="2643.35" dur="4.92">your safety zone and you&amp;#39;re taking</text>
  <text start="2646.89" dur="16.26">chances that the enemy is not going to</text>
  <text start="2648.27" dur="19.62">come after you do we have the authority</text>
  <text start="2663.15" dur="6.84">to command the warring angels I would</text>
  <text start="2667.89" dur="7.08">say you can have the authority to do</text>
  <text start="2669.99" dur="6.3">that alright so up at the the Gathering</text>
  <text start="2674.97" dur="4.98">conference that I was at a couple weeks</text>
  <text start="2676.29" dur="10.48">ago Mike Parsons was teaching on working</text>
  <text start="2679.95" dur="8.14">with angels he was flying to Australia</text>
  <text start="2686.77" dur="2.94">and I&amp;#39;m just gonna show you the story</text>
  <text start="2688.09" dur="3.93">with you because I love this story it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2689.71" dur="5.49">sort of one of my favorite stories so</text>
  <text start="2692.02" dur="7.29">Mike had an assignment from the Lord to</text>
  <text start="2695.2" dur="6.87">go to I think he was actually going to</text>
  <text start="2699.31" dur="4.95">Auckland New Zealand I&amp;#39;m not mistaken</text>
  <text start="2702.07" dur="4.29">and he we had a flight going to</text>
  <text start="2704.26" dur="4.859">Australia and they&amp;#39;re gonna fly down to</text>
  <text start="2706.36" dur="4.35">New Zealand and they had a pretty tight</text>
  <text start="2709.119" dur="4.591">time schedule they only had a 1 hour</text>
  <text start="2710.71" dur="5.64">layover between the two flights that he</text>
  <text start="2713.71" dur="5.01">had to take his initial flight left late</text>
  <text start="2716.35" dur="5.7">he got out of the gate late and they had</text>
  <text start="2718.72" dur="4.89">strong headwinds so they&amp;#39;re in the air</text>
  <text start="2722.05" dur="3.03">and that one of the flight attendants</text>
  <text start="2723.61" dur="2.79">comes on the air and says we have duda</text>
  <text start="2725.08" dur="4.23">strong headwinds we&amp;#39;re gonna be delayed</text>
  <text start="2726.4" dur="5.43">in her flight and we&amp;#39;re not gonna be</text>
  <text start="2729.31" dur="4.47">getting in at to the gate on time so</text>
  <text start="2731.83" dur="3.93">Mike is sitting in his seat he goes</text>
  <text start="2733.78" dur="5.55">stuff that that&amp;#39;s not gonna happen</text>
  <text start="2735.76" dur="7.26">that&amp;#39;s not God&amp;#39;s will all right God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2739.33" dur="4.05">will is for me to get there on time all</text>
  <text start="2743.02" dur="7.83">right</text>
  <text start="2743.38" dur="9.78">so Mike knows a group of angels an order</text>
  <text start="2750.85" dur="4.59">of angels and their name is the winds of</text>
  <text start="2753.16" dur="4.89">change that&amp;#39;s what these angels are</text>
  <text start="2755.44" dur="5.04">called they&amp;#39;re the winds of change so he</text>
  <text start="2758.05" dur="4.83">said I&amp;#39;m gonna tell these angels to</text>
  <text start="2760.48" dur="4.92">change the winds so we have a tailwind</text>
  <text start="2762.88" dur="5.43">and not a headwind and so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2765.4" dur="5.51">get into the gate early and not late so</text>
  <text start="2768.31" dur="4.83">he commands these angels he tells them</text>
  <text start="2770.91" dur="6.49">reverse the wind direction so that we</text>
  <text start="2773.14" dur="6.6">have a tailwind so they do it and about</text>
  <text start="2777.4" dur="4.59">an hour later the flight attendant comes</text>
  <text start="2779.74" dur="3.72">on and says well due to a change of</text>
  <text start="2781.99" dur="2.4">winds we actually have a tailwind now</text>
  <text start="2783.46" dur="5.31">and it looks like we&amp;#39;re gonna get into</text>
  <text start="2784.39" dur="8.09">the gate early so mike has learned how</text>
  <text start="2788.77" dur="6.48">to cooperate with these angels because</text>
  <text start="2792.48" dur="5.11">he has a relationship with these angels</text>
  <text start="2795.25" dur="4.74">he knows them he knows their assignment</text>
  <text start="2797.59" dur="4.17">they know his assignment and Mike also</text>
  <text start="2799.99" dur="3.54">has an understanding of what his</text>
  <text start="2801.76" dur="5.55">assignment is and what is the will of</text>
  <text start="2803.53" dur="5.46">God so continuing on this story Mike</text>
  <text start="2807.31" dur="5.34">gets down there to Auckland New Zealand</text>
  <text start="2808.99" dur="5.39">he&amp;#39;s teaching at this conference it they</text>
  <text start="2812.65" dur="5.4">started late the worship went late</text>
  <text start="2814.38" dur="5.35">everything went late and by the time</text>
  <text start="2818.05" dur="2.46">they got out of this conference the</text>
  <text start="2819.73" dur="2.73">security guard</text>
  <text start="2820.51" dur="3.09">it&amp;#39;s had locked the gates and left and</text>
  <text start="2822.46" dur="5.61">they nobody could get out they were</text>
  <text start="2823.6" dur="6.51">locking inside of this place so so the</text>
  <text start="2828.07" dur="5.04">first car in line in front of this</text>
  <text start="2830.11" dur="4.83">locked gate belongs to a couple of guys</text>
  <text start="2833.11" dur="4.23">who are not Christians they just came</text>
  <text start="2834.94" dur="5.16">there because some friends asked them to</text>
  <text start="2837.34" dur="6">come there so Mike had been talking</text>
  <text start="2840.1" dur="5.13">about angels during this message and</text>
  <text start="2843.34" dur="2.97">these guys were joking and I said hey</text>
  <text start="2845.23" dur="2.67">Mike it looks like you&amp;#39;re gonna have to</text>
  <text start="2846.31" dur="5.1">get your angels up here to get this lock</text>
  <text start="2847.9" dur="6.96">off we&amp;#39;re locked inside so Mike goes oh</text>
  <text start="2851.41" dur="8.28">I don&amp;#39;t need my angels I&amp;#39;m just gonna</text>
  <text start="2854.86" dur="7.38">unlock it myself so this is where Mike</text>
  <text start="2859.69" dur="7.82">talks about the reality of quantum</text>
  <text start="2862.24" dur="10.25">physics and how it affects our life in</text>
  <text start="2867.51" dur="9.61">the in a discussion of quantum physics</text>
  <text start="2872.49" dur="7.38">there are many possibilities every day</text>
  <text start="2877.12" dur="7.41">that you wake up everything that you do</text>
  <text start="2879.87" dur="9.28">every move you make exists on a spectrum</text>
  <text start="2884.53" dur="7.35">of millions of possibilities okay in the</text>
  <text start="2889.15" dur="5.85">world of quantum physics a possibility</text>
  <text start="2891.88" dur="7.04">does not become reality until it is</text>
  <text start="2895" dur="6.39">chosen and observed once you choose a</text>
  <text start="2898.92" dur="5.68">possibility and once you observe it it</text>
  <text start="2901.39" dur="7.14">becomes reality until that point it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2904.6" dur="5.79">only a possibility so let me give you a</text>
  <text start="2908.53" dur="4.53">quick illustration if you go into a</text>
  <text start="2910.39" dur="5.82">grocery store and you have a list of</text>
  <text start="2913.06" dur="6.18">groceries and you need to you go in</text>
  <text start="2916.21" dur="5.37">thinking I&amp;#39;m gonna buy coffee ketchup</text>
  <text start="2919.24" dur="4.86">and dish soap and those are the three</text>
  <text start="2921.58" dur="5.22">things on your list as soon as you walk</text>
  <text start="2924.1" dur="5.48">into that grocery store there are about</text>
  <text start="2926.8" dur="5.16">a hundred thousand possibilities of</text>
  <text start="2929.58" dur="7.3">things you could walk out of that store</text>
  <text start="2931.96" dur="6.87">with all right you could pick up any one</text>
  <text start="2936.88" dur="5.31">or any ten or twenty of a hundred</text>
  <text start="2938.83" dur="5.25">thousand things in that store but as you</text>
  <text start="2942.19" dur="5.43">walk up and down the aisles of that</text>
  <text start="2944.08" dur="7.89">store and as you pick up one thing and</text>
  <text start="2947.62" dur="6.45">knock another the possibilities for any</text>
  <text start="2951.97" dur="4.17">of those things to end up in your bath</text>
  <text start="2954.07" dur="4.22">and end up you paying for them and</text>
  <text start="2956.14" dur="5.49">leaving the store starts to decrease</text>
  <text start="2958.29" dur="5.29">okay so as you go down on il-1 and il-2</text>
  <text start="2961.63" dur="4.95">and il-2 and you don&amp;#39;t pick up anything</text>
  <text start="2963.58" dur="5.25">from those aisles those potential</text>
  <text start="2966.58" dur="4.47">possibilities start to collapse and</text>
  <text start="2968.83" dur="5.82">decrease they&amp;#39;re becoming less and less</text>
  <text start="2971.05" dur="5.67">likely to become reality there are only</text>
  <text start="2974.65" dur="5.13">possibilities and they become less</text>
  <text start="2976.72" dur="5.67">likely as reality so you go to aisle</text>
  <text start="2979.78" dur="4.35">four you pick up the coffee you go to</text>
  <text start="2982.39" dur="3.54">aisle five you get the dish soap you go</text>
  <text start="2984.13" dur="4.08">to aisle six and you pick up the ketchup</text>
  <text start="2985.93" dur="3.87">and you go to the counter and this when</text>
  <text start="2988.21" dur="4.65">you make it to the counter the checkout</text>
  <text start="2989.8" dur="4.56">counter now the number of possibilities</text>
  <text start="2992.86" dur="4.38">of things are going to leave the store</text>
  <text start="2994.36" dur="4.47">with becomes very very small and all of</text>
  <text start="2997.24" dur="5.09">these potential possibilities collapse</text>
  <text start="2998.83" dur="7.46">they start to collapse and they become</text>
  <text start="3002.33" dur="7.81">impossible when you hand over the money</text>
  <text start="3006.29" dur="6.46">to the checkouts clerk and you take your</text>
  <text start="3010.14" dur="3.66">three things and leave the store all of</text>
  <text start="3012.75" dur="3.45">those hundreds of thousands of</text>
  <text start="3013.8" dur="4.53">possibilities have now become impossible</text>
  <text start="3016.2" dur="3.66">and the reality is you only left the</text>
  <text start="3018.33" dur="4.23">store with the coffee to catch up in the</text>
  <text start="3019.86" dur="7.1">dish so okay but up until that point</text>
  <text start="3022.56" dur="8.43">there were many possibilities you choose</text>
  <text start="3026.96" dur="8.53">the reality that you live in every</text>
  <text start="3030.99" dur="8.04">single day you choose the life that you</text>
  <text start="3035.49" dur="5.91">live it is not chosen for you every</text>
  <text start="3039.03" dur="4.92">reality that you live with is because of</text>
  <text start="3041.4" dur="6.11">a deliberate choice that you made out of</text>
  <text start="3043.95" dur="7.41">many possibilities and quantum physics</text>
  <text start="3047.51" dur="6.19">proves that we choose our own reality</text>
  <text start="3051.36" dur="4.86">and you can choose a different reality</text>
  <text start="3053.7" dur="3.81">if you want to instead of picking up the</text>
  <text start="3056.22" dur="4.17">ketchup you could have picked up the</text>
  <text start="3057.51" dur="4.47">monster or the Mayo or you could have</text>
  <text start="3060.39" dur="4.35">gone back and gotten a pot roast that</text>
  <text start="3061.98" dur="6.99">was a possibility but you choose your</text>
  <text start="3064.74" dur="7.32">own reality okay here&amp;#39;s where it gets</text>
  <text start="3068.97" dur="5.46">interesting so these guys are sitting</text>
  <text start="3072.06" dur="5.93">with the locked gate in front of them</text>
  <text start="3074.43" dur="7.98">and Mike says I&amp;#39;m going to choose an</text>

  <text start="3100.17" dur="7.14">to get out and I&amp;#39;ll leave and Mike said</text>

  <text start="3110.25" dur="6.36">going to become unlocked I&amp;#39;m choosing a</text>

  <text start="3118.44" dur="5.34">reality for Mike was it was unlocked he</text>
  <text start="3121.29" dur="7.68">chose that reality and he walked over</text>
  <text start="3123.78" dur="7.95">and open the gate and everybody left by</text>
  <text start="3128.97" dur="6.84">choosing the reality that you want to</text>
  <text start="3131.73" dur="7.41">believe you choose what the outcome of</text>
  <text start="3135.81" dur="4.83">something is gonna be and the critical</text>
  <text start="3139.14" dur="4.85">thing of all of this is you have to</text>
  <text start="3140.64" dur="6.81">understand the will of God because Mike</text>
  <text start="3143.99" dur="5.56">knew the will of God and he decided to</text>
  <text start="3147.45" dur="4.65">align his thinking with the will of God</text>
  <text start="3149.55" dur="5.34">and when he did that popped that</text>
  <text start="3152.1" dur="7.62">possibility became reality and all the</text>
  <text start="3154.89" dur="7.2">other possibilities collapsed so all</text>

  <text start="3162.09" dur="5.16">with angels you can but it helps to</text>
  <text start="3164.91" dur="3.15">understand the will of God and it helps</text>
  <text start="3167.25" dur="2.28">to understand that there are many</text>

  <text start="3639.94" dur="5.64">is on the floor and God is just healing</text>
  <text start="3642.79" dur="4.83">stuff inside of her and she comes up and</text>
  <text start="3645.58" dur="3.48">realizes oh my gosh I&amp;#39;m gonna be one of</text>
  <text start="3647.62" dur="3.81">those crazy people that runs around the</text>
  <text start="3649.06" dur="5.22">auditorium so sure enough she gets up</text>
  <text start="3651.43" dur="4.53">and she runs around the auditorium she</text>
  <text start="3654.28" dur="4.11">catches up to Randy Clarke and she gives</text>
  <text start="3655.96" dur="4.29">her testimony so my wife Denise is</text>
  <text start="3658.39" dur="3.18">sitting here in this very chair that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3660.25" dur="4.89">sitting in right now at this desk</text>
  <text start="3661.57" dur="6.3">watching this video and realizes I had</text>
  <text start="3665.14" dur="5.25">believed a lot of the same lies I need</text>
  <text start="3667.87" dur="5.13">to renounce my agreement she&amp;#39;s like lord</text>
  <text start="3670.39" dur="5.13">I repent for these wrong thoughts I know</text>
  <text start="3673" dur="3.9">you love me I know you want me heal I do</text>
  <text start="3675.52" dur="4.64">not believe these lies anymore</text>
  <text start="3676.9" dur="6.57">and she just kind of got her mind</text>
  <text start="3680.16" dur="5.71">filtered out all the junk and and</text>
  <text start="3683.47" dur="5.79">changed her thinking about her condition</text>
  <text start="3685.87" dur="5.04">and then she watched the next video on</text>
  <text start="3689.26" dur="4.1">my website which was a Sid Roth video</text>
  <text start="3690.91" dur="5.16">where this dude was teaching on</text>
  <text start="3693.36" dur="4.66">activating your spiritual senses at the</text>
  <text start="3696.07" dur="3.63">end of the video he says oh hey if you</text>
  <text start="3698.02" dur="3.03">need healing gonna pray for you but your</text>
  <text start="3699.7" dur="3.09">hand wherever you need to be healed and</text>
  <text start="3701.05" dur="3.81">I&amp;#39;m gonna pray for you so she puts her</text>
  <text start="3702.79" dur="5.1">hand on her lower back this guy says a</text>
  <text start="3704.86" dur="4.8">prayer on a YouTube video and Denise</text>
  <text start="3707.89" dur="4.65">gets completely healed of all of her</text>
  <text start="3709.66" dur="5.07">back pain that was three years ago and</text>
  <text start="3712.54" dur="3.66">she has not the pain has come back a</text>
  <text start="3714.73" dur="4.02">little bit off and on but she has</text>
  <text start="3716.2" dur="5.22">realized that she is healed and she</text>
  <text start="3718.75" dur="6.14">refuses to take it back and she has</text>
  <text start="3721.42" dur="6.69">remained healed now that is an</text>
  <text start="3724.89" dur="5.02">illustration of one of the problems that</text>
  <text start="3728.11" dur="3.81">people have with healing is don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3729.91" dur="4.53">understand that sometimes your own</text>
  <text start="3731.92" dur="6.09">thoughts about God and your own thoughts</text>
  <text start="3734.44" dur="6.15">about you can prevent you from receiving</text>
  <text start="3738.01" dur="5.61">what God wants to give you</text>
  <text start="3740.59" dur="6.48">was her mind she her mind said her</text>
  <text start="3743.62" dur="6.12">thoughts about God prevented her from</text>
  <text start="3747.07" dur="6.06">being healed and and this is what James</text>
  <text start="3749.74" dur="5.88">was talking about when he said do not be</text>
  <text start="3753.13" dur="4.35">double-minded for anyone who is double</text>
  <text start="3755.62" dur="3.24">minded should not expect that they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3757.48" dur="4.8">receive anything from the Lord</text>
  <text start="3758.86" dur="7.5">now what was James talking about James</text>
  <text start="3762.28" dur="7.2">was saying if you have double mindedness</text>
  <text start="3766.36" dur="5.91">toward God if you think that well maybe</text>
  <text start="3769.48" dur="5.58">God is mad at me or maybe God has a</text>
  <text start="3772.27" dur="4.92">purpose for me to be sick maybe God is</text>
  <text start="3775.06" dur="4.56">teaching me something maybe God really</text>
  <text start="3777.19" dur="4.59">doesn&amp;#39;t want me healed or then the next</text>
  <text start="3779.62" dur="4.83">thing you think no God does want me</text>
  <text start="3781.78" dur="4.8">healed no I&amp;#39;ve seen people healed God is</text>
  <text start="3784.45" dur="4.05">merciful and you go back and forth and</text>
  <text start="3786.58" dur="3.63">you have this double mindedness what</text>
  <text start="3788.5" dur="5.13">James is saying is if you&amp;#39;re double</text>
  <text start="3790.21" dur="7.05">minded about God it represents you from</text>
  <text start="3793.63" dur="5.94">receiving things from the Lord it</text>
  <text start="3797.26" dur="4.17">prevents you from receiving healing when</text>
  <text start="3799.57" dur="4.34">he wants you to be healed because as</text>
  <text start="3801.43" dur="6.84">soon as Denise changed her thinking and</text>
  <text start="3803.91" dur="7.81">became single-minded about God boom she</text>
  <text start="3808.27" dur="6.06">was healed like that so now like I said</text>
  <text start="3811.72" dur="5.91">I&amp;#39;m not saying this is your problem but</text>
  <text start="3814.33" dur="5.58">it is one of many things that we need to</text>
  <text start="3817.63" dur="4.38">work through as we&amp;#39;re trying to you know</text>
  <text start="3819.91" dur="5.55">determine why isn&amp;#39;t this person healed</text>
  <text start="3822.01" dur="6.57">well it&amp;#39;s this isn&amp;#39;t one of the things</text>
  <text start="3825.46" dur="5.37">on the list what is your view of God do</text>
  <text start="3828.58" dur="5.28">you really sincerely believe God wants</text>
  <text start="3830.83" dur="4.59">you healed or are you wondering maybe he</text>
  <text start="3833.86" dur="3.42">doesn&amp;#39;t want to heal maybe he has a</text>
  <text start="3835.42" dur="4.59">purpose for it maybe he has something</text>
  <text start="3837.28" dur="4.98">that mindset can be a hindrance to</text>
  <text start="3840.01" dur="4.38">healing and I&amp;#39;ve seen people heal after</text>
  <text start="3842.26" dur="5.22">they got their mind renewed and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3844.39" dur="12.95">thinking straight so it&amp;#39;s just one of</text>
  <text start="3847.48" dur="18.56">the things to consider oh my gosh</text>
  <text start="3857.34" dur="11.2">portals oh oh portals are amazing and</text>
  <text start="3866.04" dur="5.56">importance are not as mysterious as</text>
  <text start="3868.54" dur="5.79">people think make them out to be if you</text>
  <text start="3871.6" dur="7.35">think about what a portal is</text>
  <text start="3874.33" dur="6.87">a portal is an opening between two</text>
  <text start="3878.95" dur="6.24">places so you could think of it as a</text>
  <text start="3881.2" dur="7.35">window now the Scriptures talk about the</text>
  <text start="3885.19" dur="6.54">windows of heaven right God opens the</text>
  <text start="3888.55" dur="5.7">windows of heaven and pour out his</text>
  <text start="3891.73" dur="4.05">blessings to the earth through the</text>
  <text start="3894.25" dur="6.45">windows of heaven the windows of heaven</text>
  <text start="3895.78" dur="10.23">their portals okay when the Apostle John</text>
  <text start="3900.7" dur="6.96">was and book of Revelation chapter 4 he</text>
  <text start="3906.01" dur="5.58">said he was in the spirit on the Lord&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3907.66" dur="6.69">Day and he says behold I saw a door open</text>
  <text start="3911.59" dur="4.29">in heaven and a voice like the one that</text>
  <text start="3914.35" dur="3.21">I heard said come up here I will show</text>
  <text start="3915.88" dur="4.47">you things which much take must take</text>
  <text start="3917.56" dur="5.51">place after these things okay he saw a</text>
  <text start="3920.35" dur="6.27">door open in heaven it&amp;#39;s a portal a</text>
  <text start="3923.07" dur="8.23">portal is simply an opening between two</text>
  <text start="3926.62" dur="8.04">realms for this purposes of traveling in</text>
  <text start="3931.3" dur="6.72">the spirit portal a portal is simply an</text>
  <text start="3934.66" dur="5.22">opening between two realms some portals</text>
  <text start="3938.02" dur="8.19">my understanding is that some portals</text>
  <text start="3939.88" dur="11.85">are fixed and some are temporary and we</text>
  <text start="3946.21" dur="9.33">can create them I say that because I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3951.73" dur="5.13">actually done it now a lot of people</text>
  <text start="3955.54" dur="4.26">have portals in their homes and they</text>
  <text start="3956.86" dur="7.41">don&amp;#39;t know it most of you probably have</text>
  <text start="3959.8" dur="9.08">a portal over your bed in your bedroom</text>
  <text start="3964.27" dur="7.05">that goes up into the heavens</text>
  <text start="3968.88" dur="4.3">Blake Healy talked about that a little</text>
  <text start="3971.32" dur="3.27">bit in his book the veil he would will</text>
  <text start="3973.18" dur="3.84">go into people&amp;#39;s houses and he would see</text>
  <text start="3974.59" dur="4.29">portals all the time in their homes I</text>
  <text start="3977.02" dur="5.58">would have people come into my house and</text>
  <text start="3978.88" dur="4.98">sit in my living room and after about an</text>
  <text start="3982.6" dur="3.78">hour of conversation they would</text>
  <text start="3983.86" dur="4.23">inevitably come around and ask me so how</text>
  <text start="3986.38" dur="3.66">long has that portal been there in your</text>
  <text start="3988.09" dur="4.7">living room at the top of the top of</text>
  <text start="3990.04" dur="4.98">your ceiling and I was like I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3992.79" dur="4.39">you&amp;#39;re like the third person who said</text>
  <text start="3995.02" dur="3.72">something about it I did not see the</text>
  <text start="3997.18" dur="5.31">portal but other people have seen it</text>
  <text start="3998.74" dur="7.14">so portals are fairly common the portal</text>
  <text start="4002.49" dur="5.5">is a is a is an access point between two</text>
  <text start="4005.88" dur="3.94">realms so</text>
  <text start="4007.99" dur="4.41">different things can come through</text>
  <text start="4009.82" dur="3.87">portals angels can come through portals</text>
  <text start="4012.4" dur="4.62">but they can also come through the</text>
  <text start="4013.69" dur="5.34">atmosphere gold dust can come through</text>
  <text start="4017.02" dur="6.12">portals gemstones can come through</text>
  <text start="4019.03" dur="7.71">portals I believe that revelation from</text>
  <text start="4023.14" dur="6.63">heaven can come through portals God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4026.74" dur="4.92">presence various things can come into</text>
  <text start="4029.77" dur="6.36">the earth realm through a portal</text>
  <text start="4031.66" dur="8.88">I believe that when people pray in</text>
  <text start="4036.13" dur="5.969">tongues they open portals I was actually</text>
  <text start="4040.54" dur="4.65">teaching one time a small group of</text>
  <text start="4042.099" dur="5.641">people and somebody asked my wife what</text>
  <text start="4045.19" dur="4.53">she does you know like this guy he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4047.74" dur="4.47">really good at prophecy this person is</text>
  <text start="4049.72" dur="4.53">really good at healing this person is a</text>
  <text start="4052.21" dur="3.81">really good evangelist and someone asked</text>
  <text start="4054.25" dur="4.08">my wife what do you do and she&amp;#39;s like I</text>
  <text start="4056.02" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t really know what I do and as soon</text>
  <text start="4058.33" dur="5.519">as she said that the Holy Spirit said</text>
  <text start="4060.43" dur="5.31">she opens portals that was like she what</text>
  <text start="4063.849" dur="3.571">and he goes what do you think she does</text>
  <text start="4065.74" dur="4.47">when she&amp;#39;s praying in tongues she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4067.42" dur="4.14">opening portals so my wife whenever</text>
  <text start="4070.21" dur="3.24">she&amp;#39;s praying she&amp;#39;s always praying in</text>
  <text start="4071.56" dur="5.37">tongues and I built and I believe that</text>
  <text start="4073.45" dur="7.01">that opens portals through which people</text>
  <text start="4076.93" dur="8.189">get words of knowledge words of wisdom</text>
  <text start="4080.46" dur="8.68">the angelic presence comes through signs</text>
  <text start="4085.119" dur="5.901">miracles wonders oil gemstones gold us</text>
  <text start="4089.14" dur="3.93">all that stuff comes through portals I</text>
  <text start="4091.02" dur="4.989">had an interesting experience with a</text>
  <text start="4093.07" dur="5.43">portal a couple years ago I was that</text>
  <text start="4096.009" dur="5.641">hotel and that was at a conference and I</text>
  <text start="4098.5" dur="5.52">had not had a dream in about four or</text>
  <text start="4101.65" dur="4.53">five days and that&amp;#39;s unusual I usually</text>
  <text start="4104.02" dur="2.699">have dreams about every night or every</text>
  <text start="4106.18" dur="2.34">other night</text>
  <text start="4106.719" dur="3.961">and I was a little bit concerned like</text>
  <text start="4108.52" dur="3.39">why am I not having a dream so as laying</text>
  <text start="4110.68" dur="3.9">on the bed in the hotel room and the</text>
  <text start="4111.91" dur="5.28">Holy Spirit said almost in an audible</text>
  <text start="4114.58" dur="5.67">voice I heard him say why don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="4117.19" dur="6.24">speak a portal into existence again I</text>
  <text start="4120.25" dur="5.4">was like dude what that&amp;#39;s how I know</text>
  <text start="4123.43" dur="4.2">that I&amp;#39;m hearing from God I know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4125.65" dur="3.689">hearing from God when he says he&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="4127.63" dur="3.479">off-the-wall things and I&amp;#39;m like that</text>
  <text start="4129.339" dur="3.331">definitely is not something that I would</text>
  <text start="4131.109" dur="5.581">have said I could not have come up with</text>
  <text start="4132.67" dur="6.39">that so I said what he goes why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4136.69" dur="4.68">you speak a portal into existence and I</text>
  <text start="4139.06" dur="4.59">thought oh I can do that okay</text>
  <text start="4141.37" dur="4.95">I didn&amp;#39;t know it didn&amp;#39;t it wasn&amp;#39;t in the</text>
  <text start="4143.65" dur="4.74">you in the owners manual so I spoke a</text>
  <text start="4146.32" dur="5.33">portal into existence between my hotel</text>
  <text start="4148.39" dur="7.83">room in heaven that night I had a dream</text>
  <text start="4151.65" dur="9.04">in the dream I traveled into eternity</text>
  <text start="4156.22" dur="9">and I was able to see the way that my</text>
  <text start="4160.69" dur="7.35">friends prayers were answered 10 and 15</text>
  <text start="4165.22" dur="4.53">and 20 years in the future I looked at</text>
  <text start="4168.04" dur="3.41">their prayers and I saw the way that God</text>
  <text start="4169.75" dur="5.85">answered their prayers in the future</text>
  <text start="4171.45" dur="7.78">okay so what the Lord told me about that</text>
  <text start="4175.6" dur="6.84">experience was first I wanted you to</text>
  <text start="4179.23" dur="5.94">speak the portal into existence then I</text>
  <text start="4182.44" dur="4.56">was you could you had what you would</text>
  <text start="4185.17" dur="4.01">call a dream but what you actually did</text>
  <text start="4187" dur="5.91">was you traveled through that portal</text>
  <text start="4189.18" dur="6.22">into the heavens into eternity and you</text>
  <text start="4192.91" dur="4.44">saw how I answered your friend&amp;#39;s dreams</text>
  <text start="4195.4" dur="3.75">so you speak the portal into existence</text>
  <text start="4197.35" dur="6.15">and then you go through it and then you</text>
  <text start="4199.15" dur="7.77">come back so portals portals are very</text>
  <text start="4203.5" dur="6.75">interesting I find it fascinating that</text>
  <text start="4206.92" dur="6.29">you can access eternity through portals</text>
  <text start="4210.25" dur="7.82">you can access the future and the past</text>

  <text start="4394.86" dur="4.98">pray for somebody in China and they are</text>
  <text start="4398.46" dur="3.39">it&amp;#39;s the middle of the night for them</text>
  <text start="4399.84" dur="4.47">and in a dream I come and visit them and</text>
  <text start="4401.85" dur="6.48">I kick out a demon you see where I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4404.31" dur="7.92">going with this our spirit</text>
  <text start="4408.33" dur="6.48">is able to travel at will around to many</text>
  <text start="4412.23" dur="5.16">different places I often travel into the</text>
  <text start="4414.81" dur="4.05">heavens sometimes I go to the earth I</text>
  <text start="4417.39" dur="3">had to dream one night where I was going</text>
  <text start="4418.86" dur="7.88">around to all my different friends</text>
  <text start="4420.39" dur="9.33">houses and I was delivering eggs to them</text>
  <text start="4426.74" dur="6.97">don&amp;#39;t know why I was delivering eggs</text>
  <text start="4429.72" dur="5.79">other than eggs are symbolize things</text>
  <text start="4433.71" dur="5.06">that are in infancy that are being</text>
  <text start="4435.51" dur="6.27">incubated that are not full full-grown</text>
  <text start="4438.77" dur="5.02">so I was delivering things to people and</text>
  <text start="4441.78" dur="3.84">this is all my friends I was going</text>
  <text start="4443.79" dur="3.9">around from house to house to Melissa is</text>
  <text start="4445.62" dur="3.69">it unreasonable to think that maybe I</text>
  <text start="4447.69" dur="5.07">was going through portals while I did</text>
  <text start="4449.31" dur="5.4">that I don&amp;#39;t know I don&amp;#39;t know if my</text>
  <text start="4452.76" dur="5.67">spirit always goes through a portal when</text>
  <text start="4454.71" dur="5.25">it is traveling in the spirit I suspect</text>
  <text start="4458.43" dur="2.79">that when I go into the heavens</text>
  <text start="4459.96" dur="3.42">sometimes I&amp;#39;m going through a portal</text>
  <text start="4461.22" dur="4.23">although I don&amp;#39;t normally sense that</text>
  <text start="4463.38" dur="5.46">they don&amp;#39;t normally sense the opening</text>
  <text start="4465.45" dur="5.76">and the closing the hallway the</text>
  <text start="4468.84" dur="4.92">experience of when I&amp;#39;m traveling very</text>
  <text start="4471.21" dur="4.65">rarely do I experience that but I I</text>
  <text start="4473.76" dur="6.41">suspect that I&amp;#39;m actually going through</text>
  <text start="4475.86" dur="4.31">a lot more portals and then I&amp;#39;m aware of</text>
  <text start="4484.43" dur="8.2">you speak them into existence</text>
  <text start="4488.21" dur="7.33">it&amp;#39;s not hard look no spirit just said</text>
  <text start="4492.63" dur="4.26">speak a portal into existence I was</text>
  <text start="4495.54" dur="3.99">laying there under bed and I thought</text>
  <text start="4496.89" dur="5.49">okay I speak a portal into existence</text>
  <text start="4499.53" dur="7.02">from the bedroom to heavens through</text>
  <text start="4502.38" dur="5.82">which things can travel right because I</text>
  <text start="4506.55" dur="5.28">didn&amp;#39;t know what it was gonna be for but</text>
  <text start="4508.2" dur="6.48">it was dreams or angels or me I just</text>
  <text start="4511.83" dur="4.86">said eyes but I just said I speak into</text>
  <text start="4514.68" dur="4.59">existence a portal between my bedroom in</text>
  <text start="4516.69" dur="5.04">heaven that was it it was done and then</text>
  <text start="4519.27" dur="6.66">that night boom I went through it so</text>
  <text start="4521.73" dur="7.29">it&amp;#39;s really simple but again the same</text>
  <text start="4525.93" dur="7.37">thing like when Mike Parsons commanded</text>
  <text start="4529.02" dur="12.45">the angels the winds of change to change</text>
  <text start="4533.3" dur="10.21">the winds he knew what God&amp;#39;s will was</text>
  <text start="4541.47" dur="4.83">and in this experience I was speaking a</text>
  <text start="4543.51" dur="6">portal into existence the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="4546.3" dur="5.31">told me speak a portal into existence so</text>
  <text start="4549.51" dur="4.98">I knew what the will of God was I just</text>
  <text start="4551.61" dur="4.55">needed to obey if I had doubt and</text>
  <text start="4554.49" dur="4.29">unbelief about this it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen</text>
  <text start="4556.16" dur="4.27">I&amp;#39;m there I wouldn&amp;#39;t have spoken it into</text>
  <text start="4558.78" dur="4.07">existence and it never would have</text>
  <text start="4560.43" dur="4.89">happened but the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="4562.85" dur="6.28">specifically told me speak a portal into</text>
  <text start="4565.32" dur="7.59">existence so I did it many times when</text>
  <text start="4569.13" dur="6.57">the Lord does something sovereignly when</text>
  <text start="4572.91" dur="3.99">he takes to someplace in a dream or when</text>
  <text start="4575.7" dur="3.63">you&amp;#39;re awake and he trek and he</text>
  <text start="4576.9" dur="6.63">transports you somewhere in the spirit</text>
  <text start="4579.33" dur="7.77">to do something he is teaching you a</text>
  <text start="4583.53" dur="6.69">principle what he does sovereignly he</text>
  <text start="4587.1" dur="7.32">wants us to do by exercising our own</text>
  <text start="4590.22" dur="6.63">free will so when the Lord sovereignly</text>
  <text start="4594.42" dur="6.24">heals somebody next to you without you</text>
  <text start="4596.85" dur="7.05">praying for them sovereign miracle what</text>
  <text start="4600.66" dur="5.79">he is showing you is I want you to learn</text>
  <text start="4603.9" dur="5.19">how to do miracles I&amp;#39;m giving you a</text>
  <text start="4606.45" dur="4.08">taste I&amp;#39;m giving you an example I want</text>
  <text start="4609.09" dur="3.57">these people healed I&amp;#39;m gonna heal</text>
  <text start="4610.53" dur="3.54">somebody sovereignly and now I want you</text>
  <text start="4612.66" dur="3.54">to go lay hands on these people or I</text>
  <text start="4614.07" dur="3.99">want you to you know get a word of</text>
  <text start="4616.2" dur="4.32">knowledge or whatever and go heal the</text>
  <text start="4618.06" dur="4.38">rest of them I&amp;#39;m leading you I&amp;#39;m showing</text>
  <text start="4620.52" dur="4.35">you what I want you to do so when the</text>
  <text start="4622.44" dur="4.44">Lord takes you through a portal he may</text>
  <text start="4624.87" dur="4.65">be teaching you the principle you can</text>
  <text start="4626.88" dur="3.9">travel through portals get your mind</text>
  <text start="4629.52" dur="2.67">wrapped around the fact that you can go</text>
  <text start="4630.78" dur="2.82">through portals and sometimes don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="4632.19" dur="8.1">to speak them into existence if they</text>
  <text start="4633.6" dur="10.86">don&amp;#39;t exist already well you know what</text>
  <text start="4640.29" dur="6.75">it ain&amp;#39;t gonna hurt to try is it and</text>
  <text start="4644.46" dur="5.55">look if nothing happens nothing happens</text>
  <text start="4647.04" dur="5.91">but if you if you speak a portal into</text>
  <text start="4650.01" dur="5.16">existence by faith exercising your</text>
  <text start="4652.95" dur="4.38">authority and that thing comes into</text>
  <text start="4655.17" dur="6.27">existence because you are a son of God</text>
  <text start="4657.33" dur="5.7">and you have that authority that would</text>
  <text start="4661.44" dur="12.65">be kind of cool I&amp;#39;d like to hear your</text>
  <text start="4663.03" dur="11.06">report back on that No</text>
  <text start="4674.58" dur="9.21">most none I am the Minority Report I</text>
  <text start="4680.75" dur="4.69">would like to be super spiritual and let</text>
  <text start="4683.79" dur="3.81">people know that I pray in tongues more</text>
  <text start="4685.44" dur="6.81">than you all but I hardly ever speak in</text>
  <text start="4687.6" dur="8.46">tongues I just I just don&amp;#39;t I mean I can</text>
  <text start="4692.25" dur="5.64">I used two years ago but I got into this</text>
  <text start="4696.06" dur="4.23">thing with Denise where we would be</text>
  <text start="4697.89" dur="4.26">praying for people and I didn&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="4700.29" dur="4.19">freak somebody out in the ambulance in</text>
  <text start="4702.15" dur="5.34">the hospital in the nursing home by</text>
  <text start="4704.48" dur="4.87">speaking a language nobody understood so</text>
  <text start="4707.49" dur="3.42">I kind of got into this mode route pray</text>
  <text start="4709.35" dur="4.29">in English and if Denise was with me she</text>
  <text start="4710.91" dur="6.6">would pray in tongues so yeah I know I</text>
  <text start="4713.64" dur="8.31">don&amp;#39;t pray in tongues very often so</text>
  <text start="4717.51" dur="6">there you go and I know a lot of people</text>
  <text start="4721.95" dur="3.21">are gonna send me direct messages saying</text>
  <text start="4723.51" dur="5.72">hey you should speak in tongues more</text>
  <text start="4725.16" dur="4.07">often yeah I know I get that thank you</text>
  <text start="4729.59" dur="48.49">next question I don&amp;#39;t know she&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4775.74" dur="5.31">actually referring to my article all the</text>
  <text start="4778.08" dur="6.66">teaching that I have on emotional</text>
  <text start="4781.05" dur="6.54">healing is three steps not seven my</text>
  <text start="4784.74" dur="6.6">process for emotional healing is super</text>
  <text start="4787.59" dur="7.55">simple ever you&amp;#39;re feeling a negative</text>
  <text start="4791.34" dur="6.81">emotion whether it&amp;#39;s anger fear anxiety</text>
  <text start="4795.14" dur="6.55">guilt shame whatever that negative</text>
  <text start="4798.15" dur="5.61">emotion is the three steps are identify</text>
  <text start="4801.69" dur="5.58">the emotion okay after you identify the</text>
  <text start="4803.76" dur="4.65">emotion is ask Jesus to take the</text>
  <text start="4807.27" dur="3.51">emotions from you</text>
  <text start="4808.41" dur="5.55">ask him to heal the wound in your soul</text>
  <text start="4810.78" dur="6.68">and tell him you receive his healing and</text>
  <text start="4813.96" dur="7.02">you could probably make it two steps</text>
  <text start="4817.46" dur="7.06">which is ask him to take the emotion and</text>
  <text start="4820.98" dur="4.89">heal the wound in your soul if you want</text>
  <text start="4824.52" dur="3.78">to tell him you receive his healing</text>
  <text start="4825.87" dur="5.84">that&amp;#39;s a third step that&amp;#39;s a bonus it</text>
  <text start="4828.3" dur="5.85">works very well it&amp;#39;s very effective I</text>
  <text start="4831.71" dur="4.36">haven&amp;#39;t seen anyone that it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="4834.15" dur="4.59">on it seems to work on everyone if you</text>
  <text start="4836.07" dur="5.49">can get a person to engage that process</text>
  <text start="4838.74" dur="4.56">and give the emotion to Jesus and ask</text>
  <text start="4841.56" dur="4.95">him to heal the wound in their soul it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4843.3" dur="6.39">that simple now it that is not going to</text>
  <text start="4846.51" dur="5.97">take care of severe emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="4849.69" dur="4.59">that covers the the garden-variety</text>
  <text start="4852.48" dur="4.83">emotional trauma that most of us suffer</text>
  <text start="4854.28" dur="5.13">every day if you have somebody who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4857.31" dur="3.69">been through satanic ritual abuse it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4859.41" dur="5.33">going to require a lot more than that</text>
  <text start="4861" dur="6.45">but that is the process that I use for</text>
  <text start="4864.74" dur="6.84">95% of the emotional healing that people</text>
  <text start="4867.45" dur="4.13">need next question</text>

  <text start="5024.47" dur="6">anything else get Mike Parsons messages</text>
  <text start="5026.77" dur="5.89">he blew me away not just the messages he</text>
  <text start="5030.47" dur="4.14">delivered during the regular sessions</text>
  <text start="5032.66" dur="3.75">but we were staying up till one o&amp;#39;clock</text>
  <text start="5034.61" dur="4.47">in the morning in the lobby of the hotel</text>
  <text start="5036.41" dur="5.22">with Mike picking his brain and asking</text>
  <text start="5039.08" dur="4.62">him questions Mike loves to teach he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="5041.63" dur="3.81">sit there all day long and all that long</text>
  <text start="5043.7" dur="5.01">and teach you as long as you&amp;#39;re willing</text>
  <text start="5045.44" dur="6.51">to listen and he just blew me away with</text>
  <text start="5048.71" dur="5.1">the stuff he was teaching us I wish we</text>
  <text start="5051.95" dur="4.14">would have recorded everything that Mike</text>
  <text start="5053.81" dur="3.99">said at the question-and-answer sessions</text>
  <text start="5056.09" dur="4.38">in the morning and the late sessions at</text>
  <text start="5057.8" dur="5.73">night he shared so much amazing</text>
  <text start="5060.47" dur="7.07">revelation so yes I would recommend</text>
  <text start="5063.53" dur="4.01">getting the messages there they&amp;#39;re good</text>
  <text start="5074.56" dur="6.09">embodied human spirits you know the use</text>

  <text start="5128.62" dur="5.55">have a lot of experience revelation with</text>

  <text start="5138.82" dur="4.53">has much revelation on that but I know</text>
  <text start="5140.32" dur="5.67">that Arthur Burke does you might want to</text>
  <text start="5143.35" dur="4.83">check up on those guys in their websites</text>
  <text start="5145.99" dur="5.81">and read what they&amp;#39;ve written about it</text>
  <text start="5148.18" dur="23.76">they they have more insights than I have</text>
  <text start="5151.8" dur="24.19">yep I can last year the Lord put on my</text>
  <text start="5171.94" dur="6.15">heart to do a an online school of the</text>
  <text start="5175.99" dur="6">supernatural I did a lot of research on</text>
  <text start="5178.09" dur="8.16">different programs that can host online</text>
  <text start="5181.99" dur="7.17">video based classes and I purchased some</text>
  <text start="5186.25" dur="5.76">software purchased a video camera and</text>
  <text start="5189.16" dur="5.31">some recording equipment some software</text>
  <text start="5192.01" dur="5.67">to do the editing for the video and I</text>
  <text start="5194.47" dur="5.55">put a lot of time into this online class</text>
  <text start="5197.68" dur="2.97">and then I chickened out and decided not</text>
  <text start="5200.02" dur="3.72">to do it</text>
  <text start="5200.65" dur="5.82">I just felt overwhelmed</text>
  <text start="5203.74" dur="4.47">I felt like my comfort zone is really</text>
  <text start="5206.47" dur="3.87">writing books so</text>
  <text start="5208.21" dur="5.97">I thought okay forget about that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="5210.34" dur="6.21">just gonna write books and then in in</text>

  <text start="5231.82" dur="7.71">you kind of called me out on it and I</text>
  <text start="5235.6" dur="6.27">thought okay no you&amp;#39;re right I I really</text>
  <text start="5239.53" dur="6.3">need to think about this again so I</text>
  <text start="5241.87" dur="6.93">picked it up again and went back to</text>
  <text start="5245.83" dur="5.49">recording the lessons I created some</text>
  <text start="5248.8" dur="4.62">outlines created some videos did a lot</text>
  <text start="5251.32" dur="5.88">of editing and what happened in the</text>
  <text start="5253.42" dur="6.78">process of creating this class is I came</text>
  <text start="5257.2" dur="6.39">up with a very organized very structured</text>
  <text start="5260.2" dur="6.89">way of approaching divine healing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5263.59" dur="6.42">based on fourteen different lessons on</text>
  <text start="5267.09" dur="5.35">healing and deliverance I did a bunch of</text>
  <text start="5270.01" dur="3.84">demonstration videos where I demonstrate</text>
  <text start="5272.44" dur="3.72">how to release power how to exercise</text>
  <text start="5273.85" dur="6.81">authority how to do emotional healing</text>
  <text start="5276.16" dur="7.86">and it took me about well six months I</text>
  <text start="5280.66" dur="5.4">from January through July I worked on</text>
  <text start="5284.02" dur="4.05">that putting the videos together doing</text>
  <text start="5286.06" dur="4.679">the editing finally got that the</text>
  <text start="5288.07" dur="5.1">divine-human class finished put it all</text>
  <text start="5290.739" dur="4.771">up on the website tried to make sure I</text>
  <text start="5293.17" dur="5.19">had all the software figured out and</text>
  <text start="5295.51" dur="4.47">then launched a class in July their</text>
  <text start="5298.36" dur="4.26">response has been really well people</text>
  <text start="5299.98" dur="4.95">really loved the class they liked the</text>
  <text start="5302.62" dur="4.95">way that I explained some of the</text>
  <text start="5304.93" dur="4.47">intricacies of healing like how do you</text>
  <text start="5307.57" dur="3.33">actually release power and what is the</text>
  <text start="5309.4" dur="3.45">difference between power and authority</text>
  <text start="5310.9" dur="4.95">and when do you use power and what do</text>
  <text start="5312.85" dur="5.01">you use Authority and what is emotional</text>
  <text start="5315.85" dur="5.13">healing all about and what about the</text>
  <text start="5317.86" dur="6.14">courts of heaven the the class is a very</text>
  <text start="5320.98" dur="5.85">comprehensive very broad-based class</text>

  <text start="5339.07" dur="5.13">and traveling in the spirit</text>
  <text start="5341.56" dur="5.04">basing the classes off of my books I</text>
  <text start="5344.2" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t follow the books exactly but I</text>
  <text start="5346.6" dur="5.19">teach on the concepts that are in the</text>
  <text start="5348.22" dur="36.75">books that&amp;#39;s kind of what the what that</text>
  <text start="5351.79" dur="36.57">online class is about yeah just the</text>
  <text start="5384.97" dur="5.76">class is video based but there are also</text>
  <text start="5388.36" dur="4.38">mp3s of all the lessons so you can</text>
  <text start="5390.73" dur="6.18">download the mp3s and take them with you</text>
  <text start="5392.74" dur="5.58">and I created outlines which are good</text>
  <text start="5396.91" dur="3.84">for note-taking if you&amp;#39;re a note-taking</text>
  <text start="5398.32" dur="4.44">person you can print out the outlines</text>
  <text start="5400.75" dur="3.93">and it&amp;#39;s essentially my teaching outline</text>
  <text start="5402.76" dur="3.33">and you can create notes for yourself</text>
  <text start="5404.68" dur="3.45">during the lessons if you want to do</text>
  <text start="5406.09" dur="3.51">that and once you purchase the class you</text>
  <text start="5408.13" dur="3.21">do have lifetime access to it</text>

  <text start="5411.34" dur="4.2">listen to the messages as often as you</text>
  <text start="5413.5" dur="4.41">want and I&amp;#39;m already thinking about</text>
  <text start="5415.54" dur="5.19">adding another lesson on to this healing</text>
  <text start="5417.91" dur="4.8">class it&amp;#39;s a subject I taught on in a</text>
  <text start="5420.73" dur="3.51">conference recently and I thought ooh I</text>
  <text start="5422.71" dur="3.66">should add that to the healing class I</text>
  <text start="5424.24" dur="4.71">didn&amp;#39;t really think about adding that to</text>
  <text start="5426.37" dur="4.47">the curriculum so I may add videos as</text>
  <text start="5428.95" dur="4.35">time goes on all right y&amp;#39;all I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
