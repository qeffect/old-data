  <text start="270.75" dur="5.64">business owners and one of the good</text>
  <text start="273.57" dur="6.21">things about this tax bill is it allows</text>
  <text start="276.39" dur="6.78">us to deduct a fairly substantial amount</text>
  <text start="279.78" dur="6.06">of money through the through these</text>
  <text start="283.17" dur="7.2">pass-through income that reduces our tax</text>
  <text start="285.84" dur="8.25">burden as as a as an LLC we&amp;#39;re an S</text>
  <text start="290.37" dur="5.73">corporation we get hammered on taxes</text>
  <text start="294.09" dur="6.6">because we&amp;#39;re employers and employees</text>
  <text start="296.1" dur="6.21">and this tax bill greatly reduces our</text>
  <text start="300.69" dur="1.92">tax burden so we&amp;#39;re looking forward to</text>
  <text start="302.31" dur="3">it</text>
  <text start="302.61" dur="6.2">it will help small businesses like I can</text>

  <text start="316.83" dur="4.43">small businesses and made sure that that</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="3.54">provision got put into the tax bill so</text>
  <text start="321.26" dur="2.92">hopefully we&amp;#39;ll have that on the</text>

  <text start="412.29" dur="6.09">which stopped a terrorist attack in</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="7.89">Russia and so we&amp;#39;re having a little bit</text>
  <text start="418.38" dur="8.19">of warm feelings between Trump and Putin</text>
  <text start="422.97" dur="4.59">and they stopped a terrorist attack so I</text>

  <text start="703.32" dur="7.11">Muller to be fired for months now and</text>
  <text start="707.45" dur="5.23">Trump has never really suggested that</text>
  <text start="710.43" dur="3.6">Muller should be fired yet there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="712.68" dur="4.23">of conservatives who have been screaming</text>
  <text start="714.03" dur="5.04">for Muller to be fired because you know</text>
  <text start="716.91" dur="4.17">they mean well they want they want to</text>
  <text start="719.07" dur="4.89">have the president&amp;#39;s back and they think</text>
  <text start="721.08" dur="4.65">that Muller is running an investigation</text>
  <text start="723.96" dur="4.44">that is aimed to take down a</text>
  <text start="725.73" dur="4.17">legitimately elected president they</text>
  <text start="728.4" dur="3.69">think that the Muller investigation is a</text>
  <text start="729.9" dur="4.62">hit job so they&amp;#39;re trying to protect the</text>
  <text start="732.09" dur="4.08">president but the president when asked</text>
  <text start="734.52" dur="6.39">last night are you gonna fire Muller</text>
  <text start="736.17" dur="6.66">he said no what are you surprised he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="740.91" dur="3.57">like I never talked about firing Muller</text>
  <text start="742.83" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s all you guys talk about I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="744.48" dur="4.59">never talked about it so the president</text>
  <text start="747.39" dur="2.46">has no intention of firing Muller why</text>
  <text start="749.07" dur="5.34">should he</text>
  <text start="749.85" dur="7.26">why on earth would Trump fire Muller at</text>
  <text start="754.41" dur="5.27">this point Muller&amp;#39;s investigation is</text>
  <text start="757.11" dur="6.47">falling apart at the seams his</text>
  <text start="759.68" dur="7.6">investigators are all being out it is</text>
  <text start="763.58" dur="7.84">incredibly partisan and it looks like</text>
  <text start="767.28" dur="6.09">they had an actual conspiracy to make</text>
  <text start="771.42" dur="4.919">sure Trump was never elected and then a</text>
  <text start="773.37" dur="5.28">conspiracy to cover their tracks once he</text>
  <text start="776.339" dur="5.191">was elected and to get rid of Flynn and</text>
  <text start="778.65" dur="4.82">you know sabotage his presidency so this</text>
  <text start="781.53" dur="5.91">whole investigation is falling apart</text>
  <text start="783.47" dur="6.31">what would Trump gain by firing Muller</text>
  <text start="787.44" dur="4.59">at this point it&amp;#39;s exactly what the</text>
  <text start="789.78" dur="3.57">mainstream media and people like Eric</text>
  <text start="792.03" dur="3.36">Holder and all these other people on</text>
  <text start="793.35" dur="4.26">Twitter who are talking about going in</text>
  <text start="795.39" dur="5.699">the streets and rioting and protesting</text>
  <text start="797.61" dur="5.789">if Trump fires Muller it&amp;#39;s like look</text>
  <text start="801.089" dur="6.42">never had any plans to fire Muller why</text>
  <text start="803.399" dur="6.24">would he that&amp;#39;s what they want they want</text>
  <text start="807.509" dur="4.83">Trump to fire Muller so they can have</text>
  <text start="809.639" dur="5.49">something to protest riot and have an</text>
  <text start="812.339" dur="5.91">express outrage and Trump was never</text>
  <text start="815.129" dur="5.25">going to fire Muller and I don&amp;#39;t it just</text>
  <text start="818.249" dur="3.721">to me the whole thing narrative into</text>
  <text start="820.379" dur="4.44">firing Muller never made any sense it</text>
  <text start="821.97" dur="4.919">would just give his critics more reason</text>
  <text start="824.819" dur="8.25">to suspect that he&amp;#39;s up to something</text>
  <text start="826.889" dur="10.11">dirty and now Rush Limbaugh is talking</text>
  <text start="833.069" dur="5.101">rumors about a letter that Trump has for</text>
  <text start="836.999" dur="5.19">Muller saying that he&amp;#39;s gonna be cleared</text>
  <text start="838.17" dur="8.579">just a rumor I can&amp;#39;t verify but Rush</text>
  <text start="842.189" dur="6.921">Limbaugh said Trump has a letter and</text>
  <text start="846.749" dur="5.791">it&amp;#39;s from Muller that says he&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="849.11" dur="4.719">probably gonna be cleared now there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="852.54" dur="4.25">this other thing with Muller&amp;#39;s team</text>
  <text start="853.829" dur="5.73">finding getting a bunch of emails</text>
  <text start="856.79" dur="4.299">illegally late in the game this is what</text>
  <text start="859.559" dur="3.72">I mean by Muller&amp;#39;s investigation is</text>
  <text start="861.089" dur="4.381">falling apart the farther Muller goes</text>
  <text start="863.279" dur="3.841">the longer he goes the more dirt is</text>
  <text start="865.47" dur="2.969">being exposed at his investigation just</text>
  <text start="867.12" dur="1.709">let the thing go it&amp;#39;s gonna run off the</text>
  <text start="868.439" dur="2.971">tracks</text>
  <text start="868.829" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s burning that thing to the ground so</text>
  <text start="871.41" dur="5.25">I say let it go let it go whatever</text>
  <text start="874.769" dur="3.271">Muller finds Muller finds I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="876.66" dur="3.179">the president is worried and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="878.04" dur="7.289">think you need to be worried I think</text>
  <text start="879.839" dur="10.071">everything&amp;#39;s fine do you think that</text>
  <text start="885.329" dur="9.6">Muller is a deep state operative</text>
  <text start="889.91" dur="9.01">consider this Muller was FBI director</text>
  <text start="894.929" dur="9">for 12 years he worked under President</text>
  <text start="898.92" dur="7.38">Bush Bush 43 and Obama and he was</text>
  <text start="903.929" dur="4.741">involved in a lot of very questionable</text>
  <text start="906.3" dur="4.32">things as FBI director you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="908.67" dur="3.839">get involved in questionable things it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="910.62" dur="6.18">very difficult to say that someone like</text>
  <text start="912.509" dur="6.06">Muller is a pristine plastered st. he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="916.8" dur="3.659">probably done some things that were</text>
  <text start="918.569" dur="4.801">wrong probably did some things that he</text>
  <text start="920.459" dur="3.99">regretted probably took a side and</text>
  <text start="923.37" dur="4.43">position on things he shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="924.449" dur="5.82">there is plenty of dirt on Muller I</text>
  <text start="927.8" dur="4.52">would never argue that Muller is a</text>
  <text start="930.269" dur="4.391">perfectly clean guy</text>
  <text start="932.32" dur="7.85">and but that is kind of an irrelevant</text>
  <text start="934.66" dur="12.03">question the real question is is Muller</text>
  <text start="940.17" dur="10.12">now today in a position where he can</text>
  <text start="946.69" dur="7.17">benefit the deep state or the the</text>
  <text start="950.29" dur="5.46">enemies of the president by bringing</text>
  <text start="953.86" dur="3.36">some obstruction of justice charge</text>
  <text start="955.75" dur="4.16">against the president is he in a</text>
  <text start="957.22" dur="4.65">position where he could make that stick</text>
  <text start="959.91" dur="4.299">where he where that could be prosecuted</text>
  <text start="961.87" dur="4.86">and taken seriously by anyone that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="964.209" dur="5.101">what really matters what position is</text>
  <text start="966.73" dur="5.159">Muller in right now whether he is good</text>
  <text start="969.31" dur="5.13">whether he is bad the question is what</text>
  <text start="971.889" dur="5.37">power does he have what ability does he</text>
  <text start="974.44" dur="5.339">have to bring a serious charge against</text>
  <text start="977.259" dur="5.491">Trump and I think his ability to bring a</text>
  <text start="979.779" dur="6.451">serious charge against Trump it has been</text>
  <text start="982.75" dur="5.67">completely destroyed whatever whatever</text>
  <text start="986.23" dur="3.99">ability he had six months ago it has</text>
  <text start="988.42" dur="4.529">been completely destroyed over the last</text>
  <text start="990.22" dur="4.41">six months so I I&amp;#39;m not worried about</text>
  <text start="992.949" dur="2.911">Muller and I don&amp;#39;t think anyone else</text>
  <text start="994.63" dur="2.91">should be either it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="995.86" dur="4.529">matter whether he&amp;#39;s good or bad or he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="997.54" dur="4.56">you know a crook it it&amp;#39;s irrelevant his</text>
  <text start="1000.389" dur="4.021">character really is irrelevant at this</text>
  <text start="1002.1" dur="4.799">point what matters is what can he do to</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="4.5">the president and I would say the same</text>
  <text start="1006.899" dur="3.901">thing about Rosen Stein a lot of people</text>
  <text start="1008.91" dur="5.19">are saying well I don&amp;#39;t trust Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="1010.8" dur="5.94">he&amp;#39;s deep state well it doesn&amp;#39;t again it</text>
  <text start="1014.1" dur="4.41">doesn&amp;#39;t matter it really doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="1016.74" dur="4.74">look Rosen Stein was in on the uranium</text>
  <text start="1018.51" dur="5.579">one thing he was the attorney he was a</text>
  <text start="1021.48" dur="6.959">US Attorney in Maryland that was in</text>
  <text start="1024.089" dur="5.82">charge of prosecuting the bribes and</text>
  <text start="1028.439" dur="4.171">kickbacks with uranium one</text>
  <text start="1029.909" dur="5.79">so both Muller and Rosenstein have some</text>
  <text start="1032.61" dur="5.219">connection to that and some people will</text>
  <text start="1035.699" dur="4.291">say because of that they&amp;#39;re bad people</text>
  <text start="1037.829" dur="5.071">we can&amp;#39;t trust them well I would say</text>
  <text start="1039.99" dur="4.41">this Rosenstein has probably made some</text>
  <text start="1042.9" dur="3.24">mistakes has probably done some things</text>
  <text start="1044.4" dur="5.69">in his career that he wishes he wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1046.14" dur="7.47">have done for whatever reason but now</text>
  <text start="1050.09" dur="5.5">Rosenstein is under sessions and he is</text>
  <text start="1053.61" dur="4.62">above chris ray at the FBI</text>
  <text start="1055.59" dur="5.49">so he&amp;#39;s chris Ray&amp;#39;s superior and he is</text>
  <text start="1058.23" dur="6.06">under Jeff Sessions and he is ultimately</text>
  <text start="1061.08" dur="4.74">under the authority of President Trump</text>
  <text start="1064.29" dur="5.28">now even</text>
  <text start="1065.82" dur="5.91">if Rosenstein is a deep state weasel he</text>
  <text start="1069.57" dur="4.38">is still in the Trump administration and</text>
  <text start="1071.73" dur="4.8">if Rosen Stein is smart and wants to</text>
  <text start="1073.95" dur="4.62">keep his job and not get any dirt on him</text>
  <text start="1076.53" dur="5.1">from anything he&amp;#39;s done in the past he</text>
  <text start="1078.57" dur="5.67">plays it smart he goes along with</text>
  <text start="1081.63" dur="5.64">sessions and he prosecutes people need</text>
  <text start="1084.24" dur="5.61">to be prosecuted he&amp;#39;s a smart guy he</text>
  <text start="1087.27" dur="4.11">knows he has to cooperate with what</text>
  <text start="1089.85" dur="4.41">sessions is trying to accomplish in the</text>
  <text start="1091.38" dur="4.23">DOJ he just has to be a good attorney he</text>
  <text start="1094.26" dur="4.02">just has to be a good prosecutor and</text>
  <text start="1095.61" dur="6.09">help run that department and look the</text>
  <text start="1098.28" dur="6.78">DOJ and the FBI collectively have over a</text>
  <text start="1101.7" dur="7.92">hundred thousand employees if you count</text>
  <text start="1105.06" dur="6.42">up DEA FBI counterintelligence all the</text>
  <text start="1109.62" dur="3.39">Department of Justice there&amp;#39;s over a</text>
  <text start="1111.48" dur="3.33">hundred thousand employees in that</text>
  <text start="1113.01" dur="4.14">department and sessions and Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="1114.81" dur="4.41">are in charge of running that if if</text>
  <text start="1117.15" dur="3.54">Rosen side is smart he plays along with</text>
  <text start="1119.22" dur="4.14">Jeff Sessions and they get along fine</text>
  <text start="1120.69" dur="3.45">and they they help the president move</text>
  <text start="1123.36" dur="4.23">his agenda forward</text>
  <text start="1124.14" dur="5.54">if Rosen Stein ends up being a punk who</text>
  <text start="1127.59" dur="5.34">wants to cause trouble for the president</text>
  <text start="1129.68" dur="5.56">he will regret it he&amp;#39;s gonna regret it</text>
  <text start="1132.93" dur="4.53">if he tries to do anything to hurt the</text>
  <text start="1135.24" dur="4.62">president he&amp;#39;ll regret it I guarantee it</text>
  <text start="1137.46" dur="4.35">so I&amp;#39;m not worried about Rosen Stein and</text>
  <text start="1139.86" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;m not worried about sessions and</text>
  <text start="1141.81" dur="4.71">people who are angry about Jeff sessions</text>

  <text start="1238.88" dur="12.1">just my opinion so Brendan dilly</text>

  <text start="1286.23" dur="4.5">what they wanted what they wanted Trump</text>
  <text start="1288.87" dur="3.3">to do was fire Muller and then they</text>
  <text start="1290.73" dur="3.69">would send their minions into the</text>

  <text start="1336.52" dur="4.47">coming out in a couple of months now I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1396.07" dur="5.43">exactly what they&amp;#39;re looking for</text>
  <text start="1398.73" dur="5.68">essentially these people are creating</text>
  <text start="1401.5" dur="5.4">something like a steal dossier so</text>
  <text start="1404.41" dur="5.06">Christopher Steele took a bunch of true</text>

  <text start="1421.54" dur="3.87">shopping around to the media and</text>
  <text start="1423.07" dur="5.099">eventually probably use it to get a FISA</text>
  <text start="1425.41" dur="6.66">warrant so they could surveil Trump it</text>

  <text start="1453.1" dur="3.63">report comes out and what they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="1454.87" dur="3.54">trying to do is get clicks look they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1456.73" dur="3.96">got a monetized YouTube account they</text>
  <text start="1458.41" dur="3.99">want you to click so they can get there</text>

  <text start="1466.869" dur="6.3">money by preying on your fear and your</text>
  <text start="1470.169" dur="6.51">insecurity and look again at the end of</text>
  <text start="1473.169" dur="5.48">the day is Horowitz a perfect person no</text>
  <text start="1476.679" dur="5.161">has he made mistakes in the past</text>
  <text start="1478.649" dur="6.49">probably does that mean we can&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="1481.84" dur="4.98">him to be objective what I&amp;#39;ve seen so</text>
  <text start="1485.139" dur="6.14">far coming out of the Inspector</text>

  <text start="1511.45" dur="6.54">different things I I think we need to</text>
  <text start="1515.679" dur="4.5">wait and and I think that the Inspector</text>
  <text start="1517.99" dur="5.519">General&amp;#39;s report will actually be pretty</text>
  <text start="1520.179" dur="5.25">objective and very helpful to sessions</text>

  <text start="1576.759" dur="7.681">counterintelligence and what we have</text>
  <text start="1580.33" dur="7.16">learned in the last few weeks is you</text>
  <text start="1584.44" dur="3.05">have to think outside the box</text>
  <text start="1587.909" dur="8.551">the people in the counterintelligence</text>
  <text start="1590.309" dur="7.891">wing of the FBI seem to have developed a</text>
  <text start="1596.46" dur="4.72">scheme</text>
  <text start="1598.2" dur="5.74">to make sure the president to make sure</text>
  <text start="1601.18" dur="7.02">Trump was not elected and then once he</text>
  <text start="1603.94" dur="7.56">did get elected a scheme to try to get</text>
  <text start="1608.2" dur="6.78">him impeached and sabotage his cabinet</text>
  <text start="1611.5" dur="6.17">and now that that is being exposed they</text>
  <text start="1614.98" dur="6.63">are covering their tracks like crazy and</text>
  <text start="1617.67" dur="8.53">the latest attempt to cover their tracks</text>
  <text start="1621.61" dur="6.78">is this NBC News exclusive article which</text>
  <text start="1626.2" dur="4.41">shows the heads of the</text>

  <text start="1653.71" dur="6.24">Trump and Russia that was they started</text>
  <text start="1656.47" dur="6.51">that before that a special counsel was</text>
  <text start="1659.95" dur="5.85">appointed and struck and pre-snap were</text>
  <text start="1662.98" dur="4.68">running that the two guys who are at the</text>
  <text start="1665.8" dur="4.11">top of counterintelligence then it got</text>
  <text start="1667.66" dur="4.62">handed over to Muller and struck got</text>
  <text start="1669.91" dur="4.62">moved over to Muller&amp;#39;s team along with</text>
  <text start="1672.28" dur="4.2">Lisa Paige and a lot of other people who</text>
  <text start="1674.53" dur="5.73">were in this little circle there is this</text>
  <text start="1676.48" dur="6.96">little circle of people who developed</text>
  <text start="1680.26" dur="5.1">this plan and when we hear about Andrew</text>
  <text start="1683.44" dur="3.96">McCabe in the meetings in Andrew</text>
  <text start="1685.36" dur="4.2">McCabe&amp;#39;s office with this with about a</text>
  <text start="1687.4" dur="4.68">dozen people that&amp;#39;s the inner circle</text>
  <text start="1689.56" dur="7.68">that is a group of people who were</text>
  <text start="1692.08" dur="8.25">committed to this insurance policy to</text>
  <text start="1697.24" dur="7.64">make sure Trump wasn&amp;#39;t elected so what</text>
  <text start="1700.33" dur="7.98">were this new news article by NBC says</text>
  <text start="1704.88" dur="7.72">that the counterintelligence people met</text>
  <text start="1708.31" dur="8.22">with Trump and Hillary after they were</text>
  <text start="1712.6" dur="6.03">nominated and the reason why they met</text>
  <text start="1716.53" dur="6.9">with them was to warn them about the</text>
  <text start="1718.63" dur="10.59">dangers of Russian meddling in their</text>
  <text start="1723.43" dur="7.86">campaigns not Iran not China not anyone</text>
  <text start="1729.22" dur="5.49">else we wanted to</text>
  <text start="1731.29" dur="5.46">warned the president that the Russians</text>
  <text start="1734.71" dur="4.16">might get involved in his campaign and</text>
  <text start="1736.75" dur="5.39">tried to sabotage what was going on so</text>
  <text start="1738.87" dur="5.77">now the counterintelligence people are</text>
  <text start="1742.14" dur="5.8">creating a story and this has never been</text>
  <text start="1744.64" dur="5.46">reported so far that the reason why the</text>
  <text start="1747.94" dur="3.93">counterintelligence people got involved</text>
  <text start="1750.1" dur="4.5">in the first place with Trump was to</text>
  <text start="1751.87" dur="4.29">protect him so that he would because</text>
  <text start="1754.6" dur="3.15">he&amp;#39;s new to politics he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1756.16" dur="3.15">understand how this stuff works you</text>
  <text start="1757.75" dur="3.45">don&amp;#39;t know the danger president Trump</text>
  <text start="1759.31" dur="3.72">these Russians could get involved in</text>
  <text start="1761.2" dur="3.12">your cabinet and they could run your</text>
  <text start="1763.03" dur="5.01">government they could take over things</text>
  <text start="1764.32" dur="5.64">so the counterintelligence people who</text>
  <text start="1768.04" dur="4.8">concocted this surveillance of Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1769.96" dur="4.77">team are now saying that they got</text>
  <text start="1772.84" dur="4.29">involved with Trump right after he was</text>
  <text start="1774.73" dur="4.89">nominated to protect him and to make him</text>
  <text start="1777.13" dur="6.51">aware that Russia could influence his</text>
  <text start="1779.62" dur="6.42">cabinet and I think this is smoke and</text>
  <text start="1783.64" dur="3.87">mirrors it&amp;#39;s countermeasures trying to</text>
  <text start="1786.04" dur="3.63">cover their tracks</text>
  <text start="1787.51" dur="4.71">because these guys in the</text>
  <text start="1789.67" dur="4.77">counterintelligence they know that the</text>
  <text start="1792.22" dur="5.46">heat is coming they&amp;#39;re being exposed and</text>
  <text start="1794.44" dur="6.15">now they have to come up with a story to</text>
  <text start="1797.68" dur="5.7">explain why they were doing all this</text>
  <text start="1800.59" dur="4.35">with Trump before he was elected and so</text>
  <text start="1803.38" dur="2.22">their cover story is well we were trying</text>
  <text start="1804.94" dur="3.54">to help him</text>
  <text start="1805.6" dur="5.04">we had to inform him we had a duty to</text>
  <text start="1808.48" dur="7.5">inform him of the dangers of Russia</text>
  <text start="1810.64" dur="7.11">getting involved so we&amp;#39;re going to get</text>
  <text start="1815.98" dur="4.2">beginning more information as this comes</text>
  <text start="1817.75" dur="5.58">out all right</text>
  <text start="1820.18" dur="5.78">so a couple of things a couple of dreams</text>
  <text start="1823.33" dur="7.2">that I had last night and the day before</text>
  <text start="1825.96" dur="7">dream number one I saw a news story</text>
  <text start="1830.53" dur="5.22">break about president Trump and it was a</text>
  <text start="1832.96" dur="5.64">negative news story and the weird thing</text>
  <text start="1835.75" dur="4.5">was a lot of people believe this story</text>
  <text start="1838.6" dur="3.9">to be true it seemed like a very</text>
  <text start="1840.25" dur="5.34">credible story and was very negative</text>
  <text start="1842.5" dur="7.19">toward the president but in the dream I</text>
  <text start="1845.59" dur="6.24">knew the story was false it was a lie</text>
  <text start="1849.69" dur="4.21">even though a lot of people didn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="1851.83" dur="2.94">it that way I could kind of see that</text>
  <text start="1853.9" dur="4.11">this was a lie</text>
  <text start="1854.77" dur="5.85">so one thing I would just caution you</text>
  <text start="1858.01" dur="5">about if a negative story about the</text>
  <text start="1860.62" dur="4.26">President breaks in the next week or so</text>
  <text start="1863.01" dur="4.03">don&amp;#39;t be too</text>
  <text start="1864.88" dur="4.17">quit to jump on that story and believe</text>
  <text start="1867.04" dur="6.96">it even if it seems like a credible</text>
  <text start="1869.05" dur="8.13">story wait and hold off because if if it</text>
  <text start="1874" dur="7.59">is a false story that is being presented</text>
  <text start="1877.18" dur="6.87">as true time will prove that this story</text>
  <text start="1881.59" dur="5.22">is not is not right so I&amp;#39;m just throwing</text>
  <text start="1884.05" dur="4.89">that out there for you the second dream</text>
  <text start="1886.81" dur="6.69">I want to tell you about was a dream I</text>
  <text start="1888.94" dur="7.26">had last night in this dream I saw some</text>
  <text start="1893.5" dur="6.24">very high-level powerful law-enforcement</text>
  <text start="1896.2" dur="5.46">people like cops I didn&amp;#39;t know who they</text>
  <text start="1899.74" dur="5.36">were I didn&amp;#39;t know if they were FBI or</text>
  <text start="1901.66" dur="8.43">who they were but they were powerful and</text>
  <text start="1905.1" dur="8.47">they were being circled around by people</text>
  <text start="1910.09" dur="4.92">who were going to take them in because</text>
  <text start="1913.57" dur="3.9">they were corrupt they needed to be</text>
  <text start="1915.01" dur="4.56">arrested and it needed to be done very</text>
  <text start="1917.47" dur="5.58">carefully so that no one would get hurt</text>
  <text start="1919.57" dur="5.22">in the process of doing it and when I</text>
  <text start="1923.05" dur="3.63">woke up of course I&amp;#39;m thinking oh I</text>
  <text start="1924.79" dur="4.05">wonder if this is talking about people</text>
  <text start="1926.68" dur="4.65">in the FBI who are going to be arrested</text>
  <text start="1928.84" dur="4.05">and taken in but it has to be done</text>
  <text start="1931.33" dur="4.86">strategically it has to be done</text>
  <text start="1932.89" dur="6">carefully so don&amp;#39;t get impatient and</text>
  <text start="1936.19" dur="6.27">don&amp;#39;t get to you know antsy for this</text>
  <text start="1938.89" dur="5.43">stuff to happen that the takedown of all</text>
  <text start="1942.46" dur="4.35">the corruption inside the FBI and DOJ</text>
  <text start="1944.32" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s going to take a little while has to</text>
