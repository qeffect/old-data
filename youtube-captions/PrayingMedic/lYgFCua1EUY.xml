  <text start="125.85" dur="5.58">available on audio if the audio version</text>
  <text start="128.25" dur="4.8">if you want that my buddy Steve Bremner</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="4.14">who is a missionary in Peru</text>
  <text start="133.05" dur="4.14">Steve does the audio for my books I</text>
  <text start="135.57" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t have the time to do it myself</text>
  <text start="137.19" dur="5.58">I know I promised a bunch of people I</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="6.05">would do my own audio with as busy as Q</text>
  <text start="142.77" dur="6.36">has been lately and trying to write a</text>
  <text start="145.64" dur="6.34">valium of books on Q I haven&amp;#39;t had the</text>
  <text start="149.13" dur="5.28">ability to do the audio so Steve is</text>
  <text start="151.98" dur="6.62">doing the audio for divine healing right</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="7.29">now he said he&amp;#39;s got I think he&amp;#39;s in</text>
  <text start="158.6" dur="5.92">like a third of the way recorded so this</text>
  <text start="161.7" dur="6.57">will be out on audio fairly soon Steve</text>
  <text start="164.52" dur="5.73">has a really good voice I know a lot of</text>
  <text start="168.27" dur="4.05">people wanted to have me do the audio</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="4.98">for that book it&amp;#39;s just not I just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="172.32" dur="5.58">have the time I was up too late last</text>
  <text start="175.23" dur="4.62">night doing this video this Q video and</text>
  <text start="177.9" dur="5.64">I posted it I got up at 4:30 this</text>
  <text start="179.85" dur="5.46">morning and was working on the video and</text>
  <text start="183.54" dur="5.7">the podcast for that doing the editing</text>
  <text start="185.31" dur="6.63">and stuff so I am working like crazy to</text>
  <text start="189.24" dur="4.56">get all this done and I don&amp;#39;t have the</text>
  <text start="191.94" dur="6.269">time to record all the audio myself</text>
  <text start="193.8" dur="8.159">however however I will say this when</text>
  <text start="198.209" dur="5.701">when the Q books come out I will</text>
  <text start="201.959" dur="3.811">probably do the audio for those books I</text>
  <text start="203.91" dur="4.5">think what Denise and I are going to do</text>
  <text start="205.77" dur="6.51">is she&amp;#39;s flowing the text in in InDesign</text>
  <text start="208.41" dur="7.01">to get it all set up</text>
  <text start="212.28" dur="7.02">I and we&amp;#39;re working on each chapter I</text>
  <text start="215.42" dur="5.92">will try to do the audio for each</text>
  <text start="219.3" dur="2.61">chapter as we&amp;#39;re doing the text for each</text>
  <text start="221.34" dur="2.85">chapter</text>
  <text start="221.91" dur="4.5">getting it all edited and put together</text>
  <text start="224.19" dur="4.49">so that would be one way that I could do</text>
  <text start="226.41" dur="6.15">the audio for the Q books so anyway I</text>
  <text start="228.68" dur="9.55">digress getting off on rabbit trails</text>
  <text start="232.56" dur="8.07">here so the question we all have is what</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="7.71">what&amp;#39;s the deal with people not being</text>
  <text start="240.63" dur="8.84">healed right is it just an issue of not</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="5.94">having enough faith is it not exercising</text>
  <text start="249.47" dur="5.35">Authority correctly is it not releasing</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="7.53">power what what is the deal what causes</text>
  <text start="254.82" dur="10.349">people not to be healed well let me just</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="7.97">say this God has in God are hidden all</text>
  <text start="265.169" dur="9.511">the treasures of wisdom</text>
  <text start="267.38" dur="9.49">okay he has hidden in himself all the</text>
  <text start="274.68" dur="5.43">treasures of wisdom and the Bible says</text>
  <text start="276.87" dur="9.859">it is his good pleasure to give us the</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="10.35">kingdom and like it or not a lot of what</text>
  <text start="286.729" dur="4.72">God&amp;#39;s kingdom is about is hidden and we</text>
  <text start="290.46" dur="4.56">have to go looking for</text>
  <text start="291.449" dur="5.491">why has God hidden the treasures of</text>
  <text start="295.02" dur="3.99">wisdom why has gotten hidden the secrets</text>
  <text start="296.94" dur="6.08">of the kingdom because he wants us to</text>
  <text start="299.01" dur="8.7">pursue those treasures those secrets and</text>
  <text start="303.02" dur="7.74">when we pursue them we find him he wants</text>
  <text start="307.71" dur="5.97">us to find him this is this is all about</text>
  <text start="310.76" dur="4.92">relationship it is all about</text>
  <text start="313.68" dur="5.94">relationship people ask me all the time</text>
  <text start="315.68" dur="7.18">how do you pray to heal a stroke how do</text>
  <text start="319.62" dur="5.37">you heal you know Alzheimer&amp;#39;s how do you</text>
  <text start="322.86" dur="4.71">heal whatever condition Lou Gehrig&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="324.99" dur="4.47">disease what&amp;#39;s the magic bullet I just</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="3.45">want the formula just give me the</text>
  <text start="329.46" dur="4.019">formula give me the magic words to say</text>
  <text start="331.02" dur="4.95">so I can heal this one condition well I</text>
  <text start="333.479" dur="3.021">have never found formulas to work very</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="4.85">well</text>
  <text start="336.5" dur="4.32">there just aren&amp;#39;t formulas that work</text>
  <text start="340.849" dur="6.731">healing flows through relationships</text>
  <text start="344.479" dur="5.531">effective healing is done through a</text>
  <text start="347.58" dur="5.61">relationship with the Holy Spirit jesus</text>
  <text start="350.01" dur="5.82">said the son can do nothing but what he</text>
  <text start="353.19" dur="4.56">sees the father doing how did Jesus see</text>
  <text start="355.83" dur="5.49">the father how did Jesus operate</text>
  <text start="357.75" dur="6.72">ministry how did he do what he does he</text>
  <text start="361.32" dur="5.19">observed what the father was doing it</text>
  <text start="364.47" dur="3.96">was a relationship he saw what the</text>
  <text start="366.51" dur="4.08">father was doing he knew the father&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="368.43" dur="5.39">heart and he imitated what he saw the</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="8.639">father do we have to do the same thing</text>
  <text start="373.82" dur="8.95">we have to learn to hear the father&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="379.229" dur="6.75">voice through the Holy Spirit we have to</text>
  <text start="382.77" dur="6.209">learn how to see words of knowledge how</text>
  <text start="385.979" dur="7.521">to see demons that are tormenting people</text>
  <text start="388.979" dur="7.911">we need to learn to develop those tools</text>
  <text start="393.5" dur="6.63">get words of knowledge words of wisdom</text>
  <text start="396.89" dur="5.74">God will give us the keys</text>
  <text start="400.13" dur="4.87">that will help us become effective</text>
  <text start="402.63" dur="5.52">healers but it is all about developing</text>
  <text start="405" dur="4.65">the relationship God is a relational</text>
  <text start="408.15" dur="3.78">being he wants a relationship with us</text>
  <text start="409.65" dur="4.08">and if we develop that relationship and</text>
  <text start="411.93" dur="4.68">we learn to communicate with him we</text>
  <text start="413.73" dur="4.53">learn to receive revelation we will get</text>
  <text start="416.61" dur="3.36">those little words of knowledge oh I</text>
  <text start="418.26" dur="3.48">you&amp;#39;ve got this thing put here let me</text>
  <text start="419.97" dur="4.77">pray for that specific thing and then</text>
  <text start="421.74" dur="6.21">boom they get healed right I think a lot</text>
  <text start="424.74" dur="5.13">of the failed healing that we have is</text>
  <text start="427.95" dur="3.54">not because a lack of faith it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="429.87" dur="3.24">because of a lack and we didn&amp;#39;t release</text>
  <text start="431.49" dur="5.91">power we didn&amp;#39;t you know use Authority</text>
  <text start="433.11" dur="5.88">correctly it&amp;#39;s because we we didn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="437.4" dur="4.079">the revelation that we need now there</text>
  <text start="438.99" dur="4.11">are times when it is a lack of faith</text>
  <text start="441.479" dur="2.731">there are times when it&amp;#39;s old you know</text>
  <text start="443.1" dur="3.6">people haven&amp;#39;t learned how to release</text>
  <text start="444.21" dur="5.19">the power of God they haven&amp;#39;t learn how</text>
  <text start="446.7" dur="6.15">to exercise authority and command demons</text>
  <text start="449.4" dur="5.34">to leave that&amp;#39;s all part of it and in in</text>
  <text start="452.85" dur="3.84">this book over the last all my videos</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="5.399">over the last year or two we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="456.69" dur="5.76">talking about those issues there are</text>
  <text start="460.139" dur="3.721">some sicknesses and diseases that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="462.45" dur="3.6">not going to get that person healed if</text>
  <text start="463.86" dur="5.13">you can&amp;#39;t get rid of the demon or demons</text>
  <text start="466.05" dur="5.28">or the demonic system that is putting</text>
  <text start="468.99" dur="5.46">that person in oppression you have to</text>
  <text start="471.33" dur="4.56">learn how to exercise authority and kick</text>
  <text start="474.45" dur="2.93">those things out and they&amp;#39;re not going</text>
  <text start="475.89" dur="5.79">to be healed until you get rid of them</text>
  <text start="477.38" dur="7.409">there are some conditions where you</text>
  <text start="481.68" dur="5.7">simply need to release power to create</text>
  <text start="484.789" dur="6.311">to work a creative miracle basically</text>
  <text start="487.38" dur="6.42">releasing power is the way that you work</text>
  <text start="491.1" dur="7.35">creative miracles and you have to learn</text>
  <text start="493.8" dur="6.72">how to do that look if you are a son of</text>
  <text start="498.45" dur="3.96">God if you&amp;#39;re a child of God if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="500.52" dur="4.26">born again you have the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="502.41" dur="4.95">living inside of you and you need to</text>
  <text start="504.78" dur="8.129">learn how to release the power of God</text>
  <text start="507.36" dur="7.14">into people to work miracles that&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="512.909" dur="3.331">like I said I&amp;#39;ve got a video on that</text>
  <text start="514.5" dur="5.039">there&amp;#39;s a whole chapter on that I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="516.24" dur="6.26">all kinds of go to my website I have</text>
  <text start="519.539" dur="5.611">lots of articles on releasing power on</text>
  <text start="522.5" dur="5.44">exercising authority right so those are</text>
  <text start="525.15" dur="6.42">some of the things we need to do who</text>
  <text start="527.94" dur="5.63">want to be effective at healing miracles</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="10.05">and deliverance</text>
  <text start="533.57" dur="9.55">I have found that over the well almost</text>
  <text start="541.62" dur="5.85">ten years ten years that I&amp;#39;ve been doing</text>
  <text start="543.12" dur="7.14">this now I have learned that probably</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="4.92">the most common thing that people</text>
  <text start="550.26" dur="6.75">overlook when it comes to healing is</text>
  <text start="552.39" dur="7.53">emotional trauma I think right right now</text>
  <text start="557.01" dur="6.93">when I am asked to pray for someone who</text>
  <text start="559.92" dur="5.25">has received a lot of prayer from people</text>
  <text start="563.94" dur="4.5">who especially they have a good track</text>
  <text start="565.17" dur="8.46">record I think and let me talk about</text>
  <text start="568.44" dur="6.899">that real quick so one question you need</text>
  <text start="573.63" dur="5.19">to ask yourself if you&amp;#39;re not saying</text>
  <text start="575.339" dur="8.101">people healed how is your track record</text>
  <text start="578.82" dur="7.019">for healing are you seeing people healed</text>
  <text start="583.44" dur="6.17">on a consistent basis if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="585.839" dur="6.031">seeing people healed know maybe let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="589.61" dur="4.32">drive it to the neighborhood if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="591.87" dur="4.92">not saying people healed regularly</text>
  <text start="593.93" dur="4.839">that&amp;#39;s where you need to start you you</text>
  <text start="596.79" dur="4.5">probably need to just start praying over</text>
  <text start="598.769" dur="4.56">a lot of people and whether that comes</text>
  <text start="601.29" dur="3.87">through your local church or you know</text>
  <text start="603.329" dur="4.82">getting connected to a Healing Rooms or</text>
  <text start="605.16" dur="5.82">some organization that gives you a</text>
  <text start="608.149" dur="5.62">setting where you can practice it takes</text>
  <text start="610.98" dur="4.799">a lot of practice look it it just does</text>
  <text start="613.769" dur="3.601">your you&amp;#39;re not going to get good at</text>
  <text start="615.779" dur="4.291">this if you don&amp;#39;t actually lay hands on</text>
  <text start="617.37" dur="3.899">people and get them healed and sit under</text>
  <text start="620.07" dur="2.82">the instruction of people who know what</text>
  <text start="621.269" dur="5.13">they&amp;#39;re doing the first thing you need</text>
  <text start="622.89" dur="7.29">to do is get practice releasing the</text>
  <text start="626.399" dur="6.331">power of God exercising authority the</text>
  <text start="630.18" dur="4.2">simple the basic learning how to receive</text>
  <text start="632.73" dur="5.099">words of knowledge from the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="634.38" dur="7.44">learning all the little nuances of</text>
  <text start="637.829" dur="7.561">healing deliverance and miracles and if</text>
  <text start="641.82" dur="6.75">you can get connected to a local church</text>
  <text start="645.39" dur="5.79">that has a healing ministry or Healing</text>
  <text start="648.57" dur="4.32">Rooms there&amp;#39;s eleven thousand chapters</text>
  <text start="651.18" dur="3.42">of the International Association Healing</text>
  <text start="652.89" dur="4.53">Rooms around the world there&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="654.6" dur="4.919">one near you somewhere I would recommend</text>
  <text start="657.42" dur="4.32">if you&amp;#39;re not seeing people healed first</text>
  <text start="659.519" dur="4.771">get into a practice of praying for</text>
  <text start="661.74" dur="4.98">people to be healed and I&amp;#39;m not talking</text>
  <text start="664.29" dur="4.71">once or twice a month I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="666.72" dur="4.83">you need to be praying for three or four</text>
  <text start="669" dur="4.98">or five six people a day to get yourself</text>
  <text start="671.55" dur="7.2">up the curve so because your faith has</text>
  <text start="673.98" dur="7.14">to grow faith acts the way a mustard</text>
  <text start="678.75" dur="5.129">seed acts faith has to go mustard seed</text>
  <text start="681.12" dur="6.029">jesus said parable of the mustard seed</text>
  <text start="683.879" dur="5.341">it grows into a large tree faith has to</text>
  <text start="687.149" dur="6.661">grow it starts out small and your faith</text>

  <text start="701.49" dur="6.269">talk about emotional healing</text>
  <text start="703.41" dur="7.679">I had a broadcast on this a while ago</text>
  <text start="707.759" dur="4.741">and I have tons of particles on</text>
  <text start="711.089" dur="6.54">emotional healing now I wrote a little</text>
  <text start="712.5" dur="7.29">book on it I have found that I think the</text>
  <text start="717.629" dur="4.5">one thing that holds people back more</text>
  <text start="719.79" dur="8.46">than anything else in the realm of</text>
  <text start="722.129" dur="8.221">healing is emotional trauma when I am</text>
  <text start="728.25" dur="3.6">praying for people who have received a</text>
  <text start="730.35" dur="3.69">lot of prayer and they still haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="731.85" dur="4.14">been healed generally speaking if you</text>
  <text start="734.04" dur="5.01">start going through the emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="735.99" dur="5.49">over their lifetime dealing with the</text>
  <text start="739.05" dur="5.61">wounds dealing with the hurts the pain</text>
  <text start="741.48" dur="5.31">the guilt the shame the anger deal with</text>
  <text start="744.66" dur="6.06">all those emotions once you deal with</text>
  <text start="746.79" dur="6.149">those things generally speaking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.72" dur="4.32">much easier to get people physically</text>
  <text start="752.939" dur="4.611">healed of physical symptoms after you</text>
  <text start="755.04" dur="7.14">get them healed of emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="757.55" dur="6.13">sometimes forgiveness is an issue I know</text>
  <text start="762.18" dur="4.32">that there are a lot of people who teach</text>
  <text start="763.68" dur="6.42">on healing and they say you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="766.5" dur="5.1">to forgive people to be healed okay that</text>
  <text start="770.1" dur="3.299">you can believe that if you want I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="771.6" dur="6.659">heard a lot of testimonies of people who</text>
  <text start="773.399" dur="6.18">had chronic pain syndromes and they</text>
  <text start="778.259" dur="3.211">weren&amp;#39;t healed until they forgave</text>
  <text start="779.579" dur="4.74">somebody that they were angry I was a</text>
  <text start="781.47" dur="4.919">perfect example I had anger toward her</text>
  <text start="784.319" dur="5.161">book Denise&amp;#39;s boss and I had chronic</text>
  <text start="786.389" dur="5.37">neck pain and I was a healing conference</text>
  <text start="789.48" dur="3.69">and somebody prayed for me and she said</text>
  <text start="791.759" dur="2.94">are you angry at somebody and I said</text>
  <text start="793.17" dur="3.389">well yeah I&amp;#39;m kind of angry at her boss</text>
  <text start="794.699" dur="4.86">because he was kind of mistreating her</text>
  <text start="796.559" dur="3.631">and they said you need to release that</text>
  <text start="799.559" dur="3.261">anger like</text>
  <text start="800.19" dur="9.06">and I did and boom my neck pain was gone</text>
  <text start="802.82" dur="9.55">so sometimes forgiveness can be a</text>
  <text start="809.25" dur="6.12">hindrance because right the Apostle Paul</text>
  <text start="812.37" dur="6.11">said do not let the Sun go down on your</text>
  <text start="815.37" dur="5.91">anger do not give the devil a foothold</text>
  <text start="818.48" dur="5.92">what does that mean it means if you</text>
  <text start="821.28" dur="5.19">Harbor anger toward other people the</text>
  <text start="824.4" dur="4.5">enemy uses it against you as a foothold</text>
  <text start="826.47" dur="4.92">so don&amp;#39;t walk around being angry at</text>
  <text start="828.9" dur="5.85">people all day long you need to release</text>
  <text start="831.39" dur="6.48">the anger and forgive people and if you</text>
  <text start="834.75" dur="5.94">do the enemy is not going to have those</text>
  <text start="837.87" dur="5.28">footholds those ways to work into your</text>
  <text start="840.69" dur="4.56">life and cause problems and some of that</text>
  <text start="843.15" dur="5.01">is paying their spirits of pain spirits</text>
  <text start="845.25" dur="5.22">of sickness and sometimes we open up a</text>
  <text start="848.16" dur="5.57">door for the enemy by harboring anger</text>
  <text start="850.47" dur="7.5">toward other people so forgiveness</text>
  <text start="853.73" dur="4.72">sometimes is necessary but but not</text>
  <text start="857.97" dur="2.22">always</text>
  <text start="858.45" dur="4.11">some people you know they&amp;#39;ve forgiven</text>
  <text start="860.19" dur="3.84">everybody but I can&amp;#39;t tell you how many</text>
  <text start="862.56" dur="2.64">emails the messages that receive from</text>
  <text start="864.03" dur="2.52">people over the years well I thought it</text>
  <text start="865.2" dur="3.09">forgave me everybody that I was angry I</text>
  <text start="866.55" dur="3.03">thought I forgave everybody that hurt me</text>
  <text start="868.29" dur="4.62">but they haven&amp;#39;t gone through the</text>
  <text start="869.58" dur="6.06">emotional healing process forgiving</text>
  <text start="872.91" dur="4.91">people is one thing getting healed of</text>
  <text start="875.64" dur="4.76">the emotional wounds is a completely</text>
  <text start="877.82" dur="5.08">different issue</text>
  <text start="880.4" dur="4.42">you can just say I forgive you I forgive</text>
  <text start="882.9" dur="5.01">that person I forgive this person and</text>
  <text start="884.82" dur="6.03">you still go to bed at night just</text>
  <text start="887.91" dur="5.64">hurting and wounded from the way people</text>
  <text start="890.85" dur="4.92">have mistreated you abused you over your</text>
  <text start="893.55" dur="5.28">lifetime and you say well I forgave them</text>
  <text start="895.77" dur="4.65">well that&amp;#39;s not the problem for most</text>
  <text start="898.83" dur="3.57">people the problem isn&amp;#39;t that you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="900.42" dur="4.77">forgive them for most people a problem</text>
  <text start="902.4" dur="5.67">is you haven&amp;#39;t allowed God to heal the</text>
  <text start="905.19" dur="6.27">wounds in your soul the enemy is</text>
  <text start="908.07" dur="9.81">exploiting those wounds the enemy</text>
  <text start="911.46" dur="11.49">exploits the those the trauma and if you</text>
  <text start="917.88" dur="7.709">allow God to heal that many times the</text>
  <text start="922.95" dur="6.72">physical symptoms will leave and the</text>
  <text start="925.589" dur="7.001">simple process that I use is you come up</text>
  <text start="929.67" dur="6.97">with an event in your life</text>
  <text start="932.59" dur="6.48">that was extremely difficult whether it</text>
  <text start="936.64" dur="7.95">is caused a lot of anger caused a lot of</text>

  <text start="955.03" dur="8.37">event identify the emotion or the</text>
  <text start="957.94" dur="9.36">emotions that you&amp;#39;re feeling ask God to</text>
  <text start="963.4" dur="6.42">heal those emotions heal the wounds in</text>
  <text start="967.3" dur="5.64">your soul ask him to take those emotions</text>
  <text start="969.82" dur="5.52">away and then just tell them that you</text>
  <text start="972.94" dur="6.69">receive as healing and and Watchmen it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="975.34" dur="7.98">that simple it is that simple if you if</text>
  <text start="979.63" dur="6.87">you think of an event that has caused</text>
  <text start="983.32" dur="9.3">you a lot of emotional grief and if you</text>
  <text start="986.5" dur="8.49">simply ask God to number one take away</text>
  <text start="992.62" dur="3.08">that emotion and number two heal the</text>
  <text start="994.99" dur="4.14">wound</text>
  <text start="995.7" dur="5.59">watch what happens you will find that</text>
  <text start="999.13" dur="3.81">that emotion is completely gone you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1001.29" dur="3.09">be able to think of that event again and</text>
  <text start="1002.94" dur="3.48">you won&amp;#39;t feel those emotions now if you</text>
  <text start="1004.38" dur="3.9">if you do that and you think of that</text>
  <text start="1006.42" dur="4.92">event again and you think of another</text>
  <text start="1008.28" dur="5.7">emotion let&amp;#39;s do the same process ask</text>
  <text start="1011.34" dur="4.44">God to take that emotion from you that</text>
  <text start="1013.98" dur="4.62">you&amp;#39;re feeling ask him to heal that</text>
  <text start="1015.78" dur="6.41">wound and then just say I receive your</text>
  <text start="1018.6" dur="7.17">healing and then recall that event again</text>
  <text start="1022.19" dur="5.14">keep doing that until you can think of</text>
  <text start="1025.77" dur="4.14">that event and there are no negative</text>
  <text start="1027.33" dur="4.35">emotions that you feel all right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1029.91" dur="4.799">my process for emotional healing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1031.68" dur="5.22">very simple it&amp;#39;s very effective and if</text>
  <text start="1034.709" dur="4.201">you go through your life and look at</text>
  <text start="1036.9" dur="4.77">those events that have caused emotional</text>
  <text start="1038.91" dur="6.9">trauma over the year over the years ask</text>
  <text start="1041.67" dur="7.23">God to heal the wound and take away the</text>
  <text start="1045.81" dur="5.4">emotions you will find you&amp;#39;ll get to a</text>
  <text start="1048.9" dur="3.63">place where I&amp;#39;ve got emails and messages</text>
  <text start="1051.21" dur="3.48">from people where they said I went</text>
  <text start="1052.53" dur="4.26">through the emotional healing and my</text>
  <text start="1054.69" dur="4.8">back pain my neck pain my migraines</text>
  <text start="1056.79" dur="4.14">completely gone they&amp;#39;re just gone they</text>
  <text start="1059.49" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t have to do any prayer after that</text>
  <text start="1060.93" dur="5.28">a lot of times just healing the</text>
  <text start="1063.51" dur="7.23">emotional trauma will cause the physical</text>
  <text start="1066.21" dur="9.959">symptoms to leave so emotional healing</text>
  <text start="1070.74" dur="6.99">is a major part of you know it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1076.169" dur="3.48">an answer to this question why aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1077.73" dur="3.48">some people healed it&amp;#39;s because they</text>
  <text start="1079.649" dur="2.671">think they&amp;#39;ve got a physical affliction</text>
  <text start="1081.21" dur="8.49">and they&amp;#39;ve actually got emotional</text>
  <text start="1082.32" dur="10.469">trauma all right so I my comparison that</text>
  <text start="1089.7" dur="7.31">I use when I&amp;#39;m teaching on healing is we</text>
  <text start="1092.789" dur="7.681">have God has given us a lot of tools in</text>
  <text start="1097.01" dur="5.2">a tool belt and most of us have never</text>
  <text start="1100.47" dur="4.079">even heard of these tools let alone</text>
  <text start="1102.21" dur="4.8">learned how to use him he has given us</text>
  <text start="1104.549" dur="6.211">power you release power to could work</text>
  <text start="1107.01" dur="7.529">miracles he has given us authority Jesus</text>
  <text start="1110.76" dur="6.24">gave His disciples authority over</text>
  <text start="1114.539" dur="4.37">sickness and disease all right so this</text>
  <text start="1117" dur="5.429">power there&amp;#39;s Authority</text>
  <text start="1118.909" dur="5.711">sometimes God&amp;#39;s glory or his manifest</text>
  <text start="1122.429" dur="4.561">presence does healing all by itself I</text>
  <text start="1124.62" dur="4.86">sometimes will be praying for someone</text>
  <text start="1126.99" dur="4.74">I&amp;#39;ll say Lord bring your presence upon</text>
  <text start="1129.48" dur="4.98">them and boom they&amp;#39;re healed God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1131.73" dur="4.319">presence comes heals them and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1134.46" dur="5.219">even say anything else they just get</text>
  <text start="1136.049" dur="6.98">healed in God&amp;#39;s glory I have a testimony</text>
  <text start="1139.679" dur="5.911">of a friend of mine Tom Sherm Itzler he</text>
  <text start="1143.029" dur="6.911">he&amp;#39;s been teaching on healing for a long</text>
  <text start="1145.59" dur="7.38">time he had a horrific back pain for the</text>
  <text start="1149.94" dur="6.239">better part of a week and he showed up</text>
  <text start="1152.97" dur="6.75">at a school we were teaching on healing</text>
  <text start="1156.179" dur="5.581">he was laying down on the floor during</text>
  <text start="1159.72" dur="3.72">worship as we were going to start the</text>
  <text start="1161.76" dur="3.12">healing service and he was laying on the</text>
  <text start="1163.44" dur="3.359">floor no one was near him he was in the</text>
  <text start="1164.88" dur="4.679">back of the church and he felt God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1166.799" dur="4.561">glory his God&amp;#39;s manifest presence come</text>
  <text start="1169.559" dur="4.531">down he could feel God&amp;#39;s presence and</text>
  <text start="1171.36" dur="5.069">boom his back pain was healed completely</text>
  <text start="1174.09" dur="7.65">he gets up he&amp;#39;s running and jumping yes</text>
  <text start="1176.429" dur="7.081">go God sometimes God&amp;#39;s manifest presence</text>
  <text start="1181.74" dur="4.38">will heal and you don&amp;#39;t have to do</text>
  <text start="1183.51" dur="4.59">anything else that&amp;#39;s another tool if you</text>
  <text start="1186.12" dur="5.01">want to call it that deliverance is a</text>
  <text start="1188.1" dur="6.09">tool emotional healing is a tool some</text>
  <text start="1191.13" dur="4.5">people have generational issues that</text>
  <text start="1194.19" dur="3.81">need to be dealt with that&amp;#39;s another</text>
  <text start="1195.63" dur="4.049">tool some people need their DNA healed</text>
  <text start="1198" dur="3.539">that&amp;#39;s another tool</text>
  <text start="1199.679" dur="6.781">right so there&amp;#39;s all these different</text>
  <text start="1201.539" dur="8.01">tools in this Arsenal that do different</text>
  <text start="1206.46" dur="6.12">things and and I have a list of I think</text>
  <text start="1209.549" dur="5.551">fifteen or sixteen different things that</text>
  <text start="1212.58" dur="5.49">I have found over the years that are</text>
  <text start="1215.1" dur="6.63">tools we can use to get people healed</text>
  <text start="1218.07" dur="5.069">and most people don&amp;#39;t know of four or</text>
  <text start="1221.73" dur="6.24">five of them let alone sixteen or</text>
  <text start="1223.139" dur="7.62">seventeen of them so getting people</text>
  <text start="1227.97" dur="6.839">healed getting them set free of demonic</text>
  <text start="1230.759" dur="8.071">affliction is mostly it&amp;#39;s an issue of</text>
  <text start="1234.809" dur="6.36">asking the Lord what what is going on</text>
  <text start="1238.83" dur="4.079">here what is wrong what am I missing I</text>
  <text start="1241.169" dur="3.421">do that all the time when I&amp;#39;m praying</text>
  <text start="1242.909" dur="4.35">for someone praying for Denise or</text>
  <text start="1244.59" dur="4.919">whatever what am I missing what if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1247.259" dur="5.28">not thought of yet you know Denise was</text>
  <text start="1249.509" dur="6.211">healed of terrible back pain she had</text>
  <text start="1252.539" dur="6.811">herniated discs and her healing came</text>
  <text start="1255.72" dur="6.929">after she repented of wrong views that</text>
  <text start="1259.35" dur="6.569">she had toward God she had let some</text>
  <text start="1262.649" dur="5.311">thinking creep into her mind and the</text>
  <text start="1265.919" dur="3.75">thought was that she believed God didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1267.96" dur="2.969">want her healed and she knows better I</text>
  <text start="1269.669" dur="3.12">mean we teach on healing all the time</text>
  <text start="1270.929" dur="4.681">and we know God wants to heal people and</text>
  <text start="1272.789" dur="6.96">but she had let that thought creep into</text>
  <text start="1275.61" dur="6.449">her mind and once she renounced those</text>
  <text start="1279.749" dur="6.361">thoughts and repented of that wrong</text>
  <text start="1282.059" dur="6.45">thinking she got healed so something</text>
  <text start="1286.11" dur="4.35">sometimes we have to repent of you know</text>
  <text start="1288.509" dur="3.331">wrong thinking sometimes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1290.46" dur="2.549">forgiveness sometimes it&amp;#39;s emotional</text>
  <text start="1291.84" dur="4.65">healing there&amp;#39;s a lot of different</text>
