  <text start="0" dur="9.719">I was in Washington DC back in the mid</text>
  <text start="5.64" dur="7.59">90s probably my first visit there for</text>
  <text start="9.719" dur="5.88">the National Day of Prayer week and I</text>
  <text start="13.23" dur="4.52">was in a service worship service the</text>
  <text start="15.599" dur="6.061">night before the National Day of Prayer</text>
  <text start="17.75" dur="7.99">and I heard the Lord speak in my heart</text>
  <text start="21.66" dur="7.619">something that surprised me and what I</text>
  <text start="25.74" dur="8.4">heard him say was I&amp;#39;m going to teach you</text>
  <text start="29.279" dur="10.71">about government and my first response</text>
  <text start="34.14" dur="9.03">was inwardly sort of an oh no and I</text>
  <text start="39.989" dur="4.921">yawned I mean I was the guy that fell</text>
  <text start="43.17" dur="3.99">asleep in civics class in high school</text>
  <text start="44.91" dur="5.25">okay I mean I&amp;#39;m not I was never into</text>
  <text start="47.16" dur="4.35">government but I didn&amp;#39;t let the Lord</text>
  <text start="50.16" dur="5.76">know what I was thinking I didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="51.51" dur="10.65">to hurt his feelings so I didn&amp;#39;t say it</text>
  <text start="55.92" dur="8.4">out loud I didn&amp;#39;t and then the next</text>
  <text start="62.16" dur="6.66">thing I heard was because I am</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="5.64">government and then I was glad I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="68.82" dur="2.28">let him know what I&amp;#39;ve been thinking</text>
  <text start="69.96" dur="4.19">because I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt his</text>
  <text start="71.1" dur="6.15">feelings I want to make him mad</text>
  <text start="74.15" dur="9.82">and he actually quoted to me isaiah</text>
  <text start="77.25" dur="12.93">33:22 which says he is our lawgiver he</text>
  <text start="83.97" dur="11.46">is our judge and he is our king and he</text>
  <text start="90.18" dur="9.479">said I I not only endorse government or</text>
  <text start="95.43" dur="5.64">and bless righteous government he said</text>
  <text start="99.659" dur="4.74">you have it all wrong you think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="101.07" dur="7.13">something I&amp;#39;m detached from that I just</text>
  <text start="104.399" dur="5.231">bless but what he said to me was I am</text>
  <text start="108.2" dur="5.84">government</text>
  <text start="109.63" dur="6.18">and all government on earth now we know</text>
  <text start="114.04" dur="4.02">this is not the way it works but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="115.81" dur="4.86">supposed to work this way all government</text>
  <text start="118.06" dur="5.13">on earth is supposed to be a direct</text>
  <text start="120.67" dur="4.8">extension of the government of God</text>
  <text start="123.19" dur="6.36">flowing through human beings into the</text>
  <text start="125.47" dur="8.22">earth to release his justice his</text>
  <text start="129.55" dur="9.96">righteousness his peace his salvation</text>
  <text start="133.69" dur="10.2">his ways into the earth he said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="139.51" dur="7.77">going to teach you about that and he</text>
  <text start="143.89" dur="4.95">started giving me little examples as he</text>
  <text start="147.28" dur="7.2">said you talk about authority but</text>
  <text start="148.84" dur="7.41">Authority is really government and so in</text>
  <text start="154.48" dur="4.289">my home one day there was there was a</text>
  <text start="156.25" dur="6.15">bad atmosphere in our house I mean we</text>
  <text start="158.769" dur="5.94">don&amp;#39;t fight that we we don&amp;#39;t we we just</text>
  <text start="162.4" dur="6.57">work things out you know there was not</text>
  <text start="164.709" dur="6.331">arguing arguing and bickering but you</text>
  <text start="168.97" dur="4.98">could tell the atmosphere was pregnant</text>
  <text start="171.04" dur="5.19">with distension the kids were not</text>
  <text start="173.95" dur="4.259">themselves I wasn&amp;#39;t myself my wife</text>
  <text start="176.23" dur="5.61">wasn&amp;#39;t it was just everybody was just</text>
  <text start="178.209" dur="10.521">like you know and so we were just having</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="11.959">to work at not being outwardly irritable</text>
  <text start="188.73" dur="7.96">and I said just thinking to myself I</text>
  <text start="193.799" dur="4.841">just kind of said and I don&amp;#39;t like the</text>
  <text start="196.69" dur="7.04">atmosphere and in my house</text>
  <text start="198.64" dur="7.62">and I heard the Lord say just did that</text>
  <text start="203.73" dur="4.81">still small voice like a thought you</text>
  <text start="206.26" dur="7.05">know and it was the Lord why don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="208.54" dur="8.4">change it and I and I just what do you</text>
  <text start="213.31" dur="4.44">mean and he said you have authority in</text>
  <text start="216.94" dur="3.84">this house</text>
  <text start="217.75" dur="6.959">you&amp;#39;re the head you&amp;#39;re the headship</text>
  <text start="220.78" dur="5.64">you&amp;#39;re the you&amp;#39;re the government here I</text>
  <text start="224.709" dur="3.551">share that with my wife I&amp;#39;m not a</text>
  <text start="226.42" dur="5.53">dictator</text>
  <text start="228.26" dur="6.509">we share it together you understand what</text>
  <text start="231.95" dur="6.569">I&amp;#39;m saying so but he said you have</text>
  <text start="234.769" dur="7.561">authority here while you change it this</text>
  <text start="238.519" dur="8.19">is a demonic attempt to bring unrest to</text>
  <text start="242.33" dur="5.909">your house so I thought what I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="246.709" dur="3.601">to give us a tribe to see what happened</text>
  <text start="248.239" dur="6.841">tonight and I just quietly took</text>
  <text start="250.31" dur="10.079">authority over any tension created in my</text>
  <text start="255.08" dur="8.67">home by powers of darkness by evil</text>
  <text start="260.389" dur="5.961">spirits and within maybe a minute or two</text>
  <text start="263.75" dur="6.09">the whole atmosphere of my house changed</text>
  <text start="266.35" dur="8.02">and people were singing and laughing and</text>
  <text start="269.84" dur="6.59">you know just light-hearted I thought</text>
  <text start="274.37" dur="5.25">without that that&amp;#39;s pretty good</text>
  <text start="276.43" dur="3.7">so we couple weeks later on a Sunday</text>
  <text start="279.62" dur="3.29">morning</text>
  <text start="280.13" dur="6.21">I didn&amp;#39;t like the atmosphere in the</text>
  <text start="282.91" dur="6.94">church it&amp;#39;s like the people were</text>
  <text start="286.34" dur="7.199">lethargic and not entering in and there</text>
  <text start="289.85" dur="5.58">was just resistance and and I said lord</text>
  <text start="293.539" dur="10.561">I don&amp;#39;t like what I feel in here he said</text>
  <text start="295.43" dur="9.959">well you change it and I nudged my</text>
  <text start="304.1" dur="3.03">associate and I said we&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="305.389" dur="2.661">change the atmosphere in this room right</text>
  <text start="307.13" dur="4.77">now</text>
  <text start="308.05" dur="7.96">we just took authority over any demonic</text>
  <text start="311.9" dur="6.6">activity in our city in a region over</text>
  <text start="316.01" dur="6.06">our house that was causing oppression or</text>
  <text start="318.5" dur="6.21">heaviness and we just found that in</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="5.76">Jesus name and released a spirit of joy</text>
  <text start="324.71" dur="4.5">and peace and freedom and within a</text>
  <text start="327.83" dur="6.42">couple of minutes the whole room was</text>
  <text start="329.21" dur="8.67">different then a couple of weeks later I</text>
  <text start="334.25" dur="6.96">was in the Denver Airport and I was on</text>
  <text start="337.88" dur="5.88">my way to I think South Dakota North or</text>
  <text start="341.21" dur="6.209">South Dakota it takes 10 days to get</text>
  <text start="343.76" dur="5.219">from Denver to one of the Dakotas you</text>
  <text start="347.419" dur="6.151">have to fly around the world ten times</text>
  <text start="348.979" dur="6.361">and then you anyway I was on a tour with</text>
  <text start="353.57" dur="5.64">Chuck Pearson we were going to all 50</text>
  <text start="355.34" dur="5.16">states and this was the trip to one of</text>
  <text start="359.21" dur="3.9">those states I don&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="360.5" dur="4.29">which one but I couldn&amp;#39;t get there with</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="5.7">one flight I couldn&amp;#39;t get there with two</text>
  <text start="364.79" dur="5.46">flights I had three flights and I was</text>
  <text start="368.81" dur="6.23">not able to get there on the airline</text>
  <text start="370.25" dur="7.86">that I normally fly which of which I had</text>
  <text start="375.04" dur="4.99">frequent flyer status with and could go</text>
  <text start="378.11" dur="4.05">to the short lines and get upgraded</text>
  <text start="380.03" dur="11.22">which is really the way I should be</text>
  <text start="382.16" dur="11.68">treated and so I was just being treated</text>
  <text start="391.25" dur="5.8">like a normal person</text>
  <text start="393.84" dur="3.21">[Applause]</text>
  <text start="399.37" dur="6.31">you don&amp;#39;t want my status okay trust me</text>
  <text start="402.68" dur="5.88">trust me you don&amp;#39;t want my status with</text>
  <text start="405.68" dur="4.29">the merit with the airlines you do not</text>
  <text start="408.56" dur="5.34">want to have to pay the price I&amp;#39;ve paid</text>
  <text start="409.97" dur="6.29">to get that just just trust me I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="413.9" dur="7.44">know how many million miles on phone but</text>
  <text start="416.26" dur="7.3">too many but you know I arrived at the</text>
  <text start="421.34" dur="4.68">airport just a little bit late and I got</text>
  <text start="423.56" dur="4.77">in line is probably 15 or 20 deep in</text>
  <text start="426.02" dur="6.24">line when I got there and after about 10</text>
  <text start="428.33" dur="5.07">minutes the line hadn&amp;#39;t moved you know I</text>
  <text start="432.26" dur="2.909">thought this is kind of strange</text>
  <text start="433.4" dur="4.05">everybody was a little nervous the line</text>
  <text start="435.169" dur="7.231">had grown out at probably 30 or 40</text>
  <text start="437.45" dur="6.57">people and we were watching the workers</text>
  <text start="442.4" dur="4.44">behind the counter trying to take care</text>
  <text start="444.02" dur="4.98">of something that wasn&amp;#39;t right and other</text>
  <text start="446.84" dur="6">ten minutes or so went by we still</text>
  <text start="449" dur="7.169">hadn&amp;#39;t moved and we all were thinking if</text>
  <text start="452.84" dur="5.52">something doesn&amp;#39;t happen fairly quickly</text>
  <text start="456.169" dur="4.981">we&amp;#39;re going to miss our flight and I</text>
  <text start="458.36" dur="5.21">thought you know if I miss this flight</text>
  <text start="461.15" dur="4.38">there is no backup plan to get there and</text>
  <text start="463.57" dur="4.75">Chuck would have to do these meetings</text>
  <text start="465.53" dur="5.3">Chuck Pierce by himself and he&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="468.32" dur="2.51">good at that</text>
  <text start="474.11" dur="11.52">the ok2say that can I say they&amp;#39;re gone</text>
  <text start="477.2" dur="11.86">and I just thought this is and intention</text>
  <text start="485.63" dur="7.11">just people in line started shouting at</text>
  <text start="489.06" dur="8.06">the workers what are you doing</text>
  <text start="492.74" dur="7.33">hurry up we&amp;#39;re gonna miss our flight and</text>
  <text start="497.12" dur="4.9">not one or two but several people</text>
  <text start="500.07" dur="4.44">one lady shoved everybody out of the way</text>
  <text start="502.02" dur="3.9">from the back of the line went to the</text>
  <text start="504.51" dur="3.33">front of the line said well when they</text>
  <text start="505.92" dur="5.28">get it fixed I&amp;#39;m getting on this plane</text>
  <text start="507.84" dur="4.71">and I thought cement stop this lady</text>
  <text start="511.2" dur="9.95">unturned and look there and I thought I</text>
  <text start="512.55" dur="8.6">ain&amp;#39;t stopping this lady she take me out</text>
  <text start="521.27" dur="6.31">but what was interesting was the people</text>
  <text start="524.85" dur="6">behind the counter who are trained to</text>
  <text start="527.58" dur="6.21">defuse situations like that and respond</text>
  <text start="530.85" dur="7.11">peacefully and try to you know be kind</text>
  <text start="533.79" dur="5.73">they started firing right back well if</text>
  <text start="537.96" dur="6.24">you&amp;#39;d be quiet&amp;#39; maybe we could get to</text>
  <text start="539.52" dur="7.44">six and to just and I thought this is</text>
  <text start="544.2" dur="7.83">I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like this and I</text>
  <text start="546.96" dur="9.18">said Lord I&amp;#39;m gonna miss my flight if if</text>
  <text start="552.03" dur="5.94">you don&amp;#39;t do something and he said to me</text>
  <text start="556.14" dur="9.15">I heard the Lord say you know this is</text>
  <text start="557.97" dur="9.65">about you don&amp;#39;t you and I said I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="565.29" dur="2.33">do anything</text>
  <text start="568.38" dur="6.459">and he said this is Anna this is a</text>
  <text start="570.82" dur="5.79">demonic assignment to keep you this is a</text>
  <text start="574.839" dur="5.221">demonic attempt to keep you from your</text>
  <text start="576.61" dur="5.61">fulfillment and I thought could that</text>
  <text start="580.06" dur="6.08">really happen then he reminded me of a</text>
  <text start="582.22" dur="8.88">verse in Thessalonians where Paul said I</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="10.63">tried to come to you twice and Satan</text>
  <text start="591.1" dur="8.64">toward us stopped me he didn&amp;#39;t say God</text>
  <text start="596.77" dur="3.8">changed his mind he didn&amp;#39;t say I changed</text>
  <text start="599.74" dur="5.61">my mind</text>
  <text start="600.57" dur="6.15">he didn&amp;#39;t say circumstances just got in</text>
  <text start="605.35" dur="7.83">the way</text>
  <text start="606.72" dur="8.26">he said Satan stopped me and I thought</text>
  <text start="613.18" dur="7.08">to myself well if Satan could stop the</text>
  <text start="614.98" dur="8.25">Apostle Paul maybe he could mess with me</text>
  <text start="620.26" dur="7.62">once in a while not that I&amp;#39;m on that</text>
  <text start="623.23" dur="6.78">level as far as the enemy not liking me</text>
  <text start="627.88" dur="5.01">but we know Paul was a man of faith</text>
  <text start="630.01" dur="4.98">pause a man of authority I thought if</text>
  <text start="632.89" dur="8.16">the enemy could sneak in and take</text>
  <text start="634.99" dur="7.409">advantage of Paul and so I said to the</text>
  <text start="641.05" dur="5.34">Lord I said well if that&amp;#39;s what this is</text>
  <text start="642.399" dur="8.25">then do something do something I work</text>
  <text start="646.39" dur="6.479">for you do something he said you do</text>
  <text start="650.649" dur="5.05">something</text>
  <text start="652.869" dur="7.15">and I said what am I supposed to do he</text>
  <text start="655.699" dur="5.971">said do what you did in your house and</text>
  <text start="660.019" dur="3.18">when the Lord said to me I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="661.67" dur="3.62">teach you about government this was the</text>
  <text start="663.199" dur="7.29">farthest thing from my mind I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="665.29" dur="8.649">Republicans Democrats executive judicial</text>
  <text start="670.489" dur="5.76">legislative and I&amp;#39;m thinking uh I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="673.939" dur="6.15">know I didn&amp;#39;t really understand that he</text>
  <text start="676.249" dur="5.971">was going to teach me how to move in his</text>
  <text start="680.089" dur="6.15">delegated authority in the earth and</text>
  <text start="682.22" dur="6.359">then expand that in my mind so because</text>
  <text start="686.239" dur="5.07">it&amp;#39;s all the same principle whether</text>
  <text start="688.579" dur="4.651">you&amp;#39;re governing your home or your</text>
  <text start="691.309" dur="4.5">congregation or a nation</text>
  <text start="693.23" dur="6.99">you&amp;#39;re supposed to be releasing the</text>
  <text start="695.809" dur="11.58">authority of God into that situation to</text>
  <text start="700.22" dur="11.159">rule for him in the earth and he said</text>
  <text start="707.389" dur="6.69">just take authority over this strife and</text>
  <text start="711.379" dur="4.351">tension and just decree I will get on</text>
  <text start="714.079" dur="5.97">this airplane and I will fulfill my</text>
  <text start="715.73" dur="7.5">assignment so I did quietly no one knew</text>
  <text start="720.049" dur="5.4">what I was doing and then I waited for a</text>
  <text start="723.23" dur="6.089">moment or two and I heard Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="725.449" dur="8.24">just say to me now get out of line and</text>
  <text start="729.319" dur="4.37">go over here to the end of the counter</text>
  <text start="733.749" dur="7.15">and I&amp;#39;ll show you what to do next and I</text>
  <text start="736.879" dur="6.781">thought I explained to the Lord because</text>
  <text start="740.899" dur="5.411">he doesn&amp;#39;t have to fly and he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="743.66" dur="5.409">know how this stuff works</text>
  <text start="746.31" dur="6.3">so I explained to him if I get out of</text>
  <text start="749.069" dur="15.24">line and it&amp;#39;s just not you see I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="752.61" dur="13.44">have a bus I have planes I said if I get</text>
  <text start="764.309" dur="3.51">out of line and go over there and this</text>
  <text start="766.05" dur="5.49">is not you then I&amp;#39;m gonna be at the end</text>
  <text start="767.819" dur="6.151">of line it&amp;#39;s about 80 deep now and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="771.54" dur="4.2">probably not gonna make this flight and</text>
  <text start="773.97" dur="4.02">I heard the Lord again just take over</text>
  <text start="775.74" dur="4.289">there East and so I excused myself I</text>
  <text start="777.99" dur="3.81">went back through the rope and walked</text>

  <text start="3814.2" dur="4.29">quickly</text>
  <text start="3814.71" dur="6.12">I had a friend who ministers in</text>
  <text start="3818.49" dur="3.9">Washington DC on that&amp;#39;s where he lives</text>
  <text start="3820.83" dur="4.46">and has a prayer ministry there and he</text>
  <text start="3822.39" dur="9.66">had a dream shortly before the elections</text>
  <text start="3825.29" dur="10.39">and in the dream he was in a camper with</text>
  <text start="3832.05" dur="8.309">President Trump who in the dream had</text>
  <text start="3835.68" dur="9">already won the presidency it was laying</text>
  <text start="3840.359" dur="9.421">on a little bunk in the camper telling</text>
  <text start="3844.68" dur="6.24">my friend how they&amp;#39;d won I&amp;#39;ll think he</text>
  <text start="3849.78" dur="3.74">said think about Russia</text>
  <text start="3850.92" dur="2.6">but anyway</text>
  <text start="3854.84" dur="12.81">I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said that and a</text>
  <text start="3865.31" dur="11.91">storm came while they were in the camper</text>
  <text start="3867.65" dur="13.92">in doubt a deluge of rain came in and he</text>
  <text start="3877.22" dur="8.04">was uh uh very very quickly it was</text>
  <text start="3881.57" dur="6.84">obvious that the camper had a leak and</text>
  <text start="3885.26" dur="5.88">uh there&amp;#39;s like three places it was just</text>
  <text start="3888.41" dur="8.34">coming in fast and it was leak was right</text>
  <text start="3891.14" dur="10.16">over his head but as he watched as the</text>
  <text start="3896.75" dur="6.72">water began to flow an invisible force</text>
  <text start="3901.3" dur="7.42">diverted the water and it couldn&amp;#39;t hit</text>
  <text start="3903.47" dur="10.85">his head as we prayed about the</text>
  <text start="3908.72" dur="10.68">interpretation I think it&amp;#39;s this that</text>
  <text start="3914.32" dur="7.3">there are leaks in his camp and I really</text>
  <text start="3919.4" dur="3.78">didn&amp;#39;t think at the time that was all</text>
  <text start="3921.62" dur="7.8">that significant you know there&amp;#39;s always</text>
  <text start="3923.18" dur="7.98">leaks and government little did i any of</text>
  <text start="3929.42" dur="3.84">us realize at the time that it would</text>
  <text start="3931.16" dur="7.53">become so significant that the man can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3933.26" dur="12.9">even cover because of the leaks but in</text>
  <text start="3938.69" dur="10.94">the dream the deluge could not hit his</text>
  <text start="3946.16" dur="7.26">head which is symbolic of government and</text>
  <text start="3949.63" dur="7.38">headship authority in other words if the</text>
  <text start="3953.42" dur="6.24">dream is to be trusted God was saying</text>
  <text start="3957.01" dur="5.86">and I believe that the man in the dream</text>
  <text start="3959.66" dur="11.58">being there represents the church the</text>
  <text start="3962.87" dur="10.44">praying church if the church prays these</text>
  <text start="3971.24" dur="4.29">forces that are trying to keep him from</text>
  <text start="3973.31" dur="4.46">doing what he needs to do will not be</text>
  <text start="3975.53" dur="2.24">successful</text>
  <text start="3980.15" dur="5.46">you know and if mr. Trump has broken the</text>
  <text start="3982.98" dur="5.82">law and he&amp;#39;s done things that need to be</text>
  <text start="3985.61" dur="5.88">exposed I want to expose their bad</text>
  <text start="3988.8" dur="10.05">enough that he needs to be out</text>
  <text start="3991.49" dur="12.46">I&amp;#39;ll take pence but I don&amp;#39;t believe that</text>
  <text start="3998.85" dur="7.55">I don&amp;#39;t believe that that is the case I</text>
  <text start="4003.95" dur="6.45">believe that it is an attempt to</text>
  <text start="4006.4" dur="6.7">discredit him and keep him from doing</text>
  <text start="4010.4" dur="6.03">the things that we all know need to be</text>
  <text start="4013.1" dur="9.03">done to reform this nation and this</text>
  <text start="4016.43" dur="14.34">government and I believe we can pray</text>
  <text start="4022.13" dur="11.57">until these unethical leakers are</text>
  <text start="4030.77" dur="2.93">exposed</text>
  <text start="4042.47" dur="8.46">so I&amp;#39;m going to lead us in prayer for a</text>
  <text start="4045.44" dur="5.49">few minutes I&amp;#39;m going to pray that</text>
  <text start="4051.44" dur="7.57">President Trump becomes a man of Prayer</text>
  <text start="4055.7" dur="8.26">Ezekiel 22:30 and weeps over this nation</text>
  <text start="4059.01" dur="10.44">in intercession I&amp;#39;m going to pray that</text>
  <text start="4063.96" dur="12.17">he becomes so close to Jesus that his</text>
  <text start="4069.45" dur="11.42">new name will be John and that he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="4076.13" dur="10.03">have tremendous revelation in sight</text>
  <text start="4080.87" dur="9.4">understanding from heaven and that his</text>
  <text start="4086.16" dur="8.16">cabinet will and I&amp;#39;m going to pray that</text>
  <text start="4090.27" dur="7.41">every force that has been raised up in</text>
  <text start="4094.32" dur="8.9">this nation to stop the change that</text>

  <text start="4103.22" dur="8.05">by the Spirit of the Lord and angelic</text>
  <text start="4106.89" dur="14.21">forces so we can see the change we need</text>
  <text start="4111.27" dur="9.83">to see I think we should stand</text>
