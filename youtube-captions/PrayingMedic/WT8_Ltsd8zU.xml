  <text start="27.23" dur="6.329">has been doing a series of YouTube</text>
  <text start="28.939" dur="7.951">videos started out with the title</text>
  <text start="33.559" dur="5.341">where&amp;#39;s Erik Braverman Erik Braverman</text>
  <text start="36.89" dur="5.79">was the former CEO of the Clinton</text>

  <text start="42.68" dur="3.36">the first 30 days or so of a series of</text>
  <text start="45.32" dur="4.169">videos</text>
  <text start="46.04" dur="5.85">George was tracking down leads and</text>
  <text start="49.489" dur="8.481">investigating what may have happened -</text>
  <text start="51.89" dur="9.3">Erik Braverman and it ran into this long</text>
  <text start="57.97" dur="5.35">series of videos where George got</text>
  <text start="61.19" dur="5.61">heavily involved in investigating the</text>
  <text start="63.32" dur="6.18">Clinton Foundation which turned into</text>
  <text start="66.8" dur="5.91">this big spiderweb of many different</text>
  <text start="69.5" dur="6.869">connected agencies companies uncovered a</text>
  <text start="72.71" dur="5.24">lot of criminal activity in Haiti and in</text>
  <text start="76.369" dur="5.191">many different places in the Middle East</text>
  <text start="77.95" dur="5.65">so he&amp;#39;s been doing this series of videos</text>
  <text start="81.56" dur="4.08">I think there&amp;#39;s over 700 videos that</text>
  <text start="83.6" dur="6.75">he&amp;#39;s done now in the last eight or nine</text>
  <text start="85.64" dur="7.08">months the thing with George Webb is he</text>
  <text start="90.35" dur="5.28">drives people crazy for a couple of</text>
  <text start="92.72" dur="5.31">reasons for those of you don&amp;#39;t know he</text>
  <text start="95.63" dur="5.279">switched over some has broadcasting to</text>
  <text start="98.03" dur="5.61">periscope so in addition to doing the</text>
  <text start="100.909" dur="5.671">little daily know three or four or five</text>
  <text start="103.64" dur="5.25">or twelve small two or three-minute</text>
  <text start="106.58" dur="6.41">YouTube videos he&amp;#39;s doing longer</text>
  <text start="108.89" dur="7.53">periscopes and he&amp;#39;s he teamed up with</text>
  <text start="112.99" dur="5.79">Jason Goodman and he&amp;#39;s also an</text>
  <text start="116.42" dur="4.23">investigator and they had been</text>
  <text start="118.78" dur="4.15">collaborating the last I don&amp;#39;t know a</text>
  <text start="120.65" dur="3">week or so or two weeks putting your</text>
  <text start="122.93" dur="2.85">heads together</text>
  <text start="123.65" dur="3.81">because they&amp;#39;re getting close they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="125.78" dur="4.769">getting close to something right now</text>
  <text start="127.46" dur="5.67">it&amp;#39;s kind of turned to the investigation</text>
  <text start="130.549" dur="4.261">has turned back to Seth rich and now</text>
  <text start="133.13" dur="3.919">Eric Braverman is back in the picture</text>
  <text start="134.81" dur="5.7">again he had been gone for a while</text>
  <text start="137.049" dur="4.69">George and Jason and everybody who is</text>
  <text start="140.51" dur="3.66">doing this citizen journalism</text>
  <text start="141.739" dur="5.101">investigation is at risk because they</text>
  <text start="144.17" dur="5.189">are investigating people who are very</text>
  <text start="146.84" dur="3.44">powerful and are not afraid to take out</text>
  <text start="149.359" dur="3.621">their enemies</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="5.52">there are already a lot of people who</text>
  <text start="152.98" dur="6.2">have died from suspicious circumstances</text>
  <text start="155.8" dur="7.05">so what they&amp;#39;re doing is dangerous but</text>
  <text start="159.18" dur="8.62">the reasons why George Webb will drive</text>
  <text start="162.85" dur="9.06">you crazy is his personality type George</text>
  <text start="167.8" dur="9.689">Webb is the personality type that David</text>
  <text start="171.91" dur="7.89">Kersey called the rational architect the</text>
  <text start="177.489" dur="6.391">rational architect is a personality type</text>
  <text start="179.8" dur="7.469">that is an introvert there are abstract</text>
  <text start="183.88" dur="5.13">thinker they these people are very logic</text>
  <text start="187.269" dur="5.341">driven they&amp;#39;re very scientific they tend</text>
  <text start="189.01" dur="6.809">to be very analytical they are not</text>
  <text start="192.61" dur="6.78">always the best communicators when it</text>
  <text start="195.819" dur="7.5">comes to communicating with people in a</text>
  <text start="199.39" dur="6.51">social environment or group rational</text>
  <text start="203.319" dur="6.061">personality types tend to be somewhat</text>
  <text start="205.9" dur="6">socially clumsy they don&amp;#39;t always pick</text>
  <text start="209.38" dur="6.3">up on subtle social cues they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="211.9" dur="6.809">always pick up on what is acceptable and</text>
  <text start="215.68" dur="4.649">not acceptable in certain groups it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="218.709" dur="4.651">had to be very intelligent they also</text>
  <text start="220.329" dur="6.75">tend to be a little bit late and slow</text>
  <text start="223.36" dur="5.52">and picking up on social cues so what</text>
  <text start="227.079" dur="4.171">you notice with George Webb as he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="228.88" dur="5.1">going through the You Tube videos he is</text>
  <text start="231.25" dur="5.04">pointing his camera at his laptop and</text>
  <text start="233.98" dur="5.43">he&amp;#39;s trying to explain to you what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="236.29" dur="4.86">found the connections the people the</text>
  <text start="239.41" dur="3.63">places he&amp;#39;s pointing on all the news</text>
  <text start="241.15" dur="4.619">articles he&amp;#39;s showing you all the</text>
  <text start="243.04" dur="4.47">research he&amp;#39;s done but you never see his</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="3.201">face at least not for the first three or</text>
  <text start="247.51" dur="3.81">four months you never saw his face</text>
  <text start="248.97" dur="5.2">you saw the computer screen and he would</text>
  <text start="251.32" dur="4.59">flip from from window to window to add</text>
  <text start="254.17" dur="4.86">the tab on the computer screen to show</text>
  <text start="255.91" dur="5.579">you it was going on a few months ago</text>
  <text start="259.03" dur="4.86">people got concerns that maybe he was</text>
  <text start="261.489" dur="4.921">getting in too deep and so they were</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="4.26">asking for a proof of life so George</text>
  <text start="266.41" dur="4.14">started doing some proof of life videos</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="4.32">where he&amp;#39;s actually video during a</text>
  <text start="270.55" dur="4.23">producing of a short video of himself</text>
  <text start="272.47" dur="3.66">telling what day it was and some recent</text>
  <text start="274.78" dur="4.47">events that happen so people know he was</text>
  <text start="276.13" dur="6.15">still alive but it&amp;#39;s obvious that George</text>
  <text start="279.25" dur="4.74">is not an extrovert he is an introvert</text>
  <text start="282.28" dur="6.89">he doesn&amp;#39;t like being on camera</text>
  <text start="283.99" dur="10.07">this personality type is very good at</text>
  <text start="289.17" dur="7.96">systems analysis of the rational</text>
  <text start="294.06" dur="5.41">architect is a personality type where</text>
  <text start="297.13" dur="3.96">everything has to be logical things need</text>
  <text start="299.47" dur="4.05">to make sense to them and if something</text>
  <text start="301.09" dur="4.77">does not make sense something is not</text>
  <text start="303.52" dur="3.78">logical or rational there&amp;#39;s a little red</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="4.71">flag that goes off in their brain that</text>
  <text start="307.3" dur="5.4">says that does not compute that does not</text>
  <text start="310.57" dur="6.06">make sense something is wrong here</text>
  <text start="312.7" dur="7.26">these people are very analytical and and</text>
  <text start="316.63" dur="7.89">the reason why Kersey gave that group</text>
  <text start="319.96" dur="6.93">that the architect labelled is they tend</text>
  <text start="324.52" dur="4.08">to be very good at analyzing systems so</text>
  <text start="326.89" dur="5.4">they tend to be people who are</text>
  <text start="328.6" dur="8.13">architects or engineers who are software</text>
  <text start="332.29" dur="6.21">programmers I my stepson Carl is this</text>
  <text start="336.73" dur="5.96">personality type he is an electrical</text>
  <text start="338.5" dur="8.58">engineer George Webb has a history in</text>
  <text start="342.69" dur="6.73">computer systems he used to work for a</text>
  <text start="347.08" dur="5.04">company that did software computer</text>
  <text start="349.42" dur="5.34">software and systems and servers ok that</text>
  <text start="352.12" dur="5.79">is in keeping with this personality type</text>
  <text start="354.76" dur="6.87">they look at systems and they see how</text>
  <text start="357.91" dur="7.13">things fit together into a system to me</text>
  <text start="361.63" dur="8.42">it is very interesting that God chose</text>
  <text start="365.04" dur="9.76">George Webb to be the person who would</text>
  <text start="370.05" dur="9.66">investigate and analyze this incredibly</text>
  <text start="374.8" dur="6.8">complex system of interrelated people</text>
  <text start="379.71" dur="4.96">nonprofit organizations government</text>
  <text start="381.6" dur="6.75">organizations private companies involved</text>
  <text start="384.67" dur="8.07">in this elaborate web of corruption</text>
  <text start="388.35" dur="8.65">blackmail murder extortion sex crimes</text>
  <text start="392.74" dur="8.34">you name it and you had this guy leading</text>
  <text start="397" dur="7.01">the investigation who is all about</text>
  <text start="401.08" dur="7.02">systems and how a systems fit together</text>
  <text start="404.01" dur="7.27">so it&amp;#39;s to me it&amp;#39;s extremely interesting</text>
  <text start="408.1" dur="5.91">that God chose George Webb to do this</text>
  <text start="411.28" dur="4.859">investigation the crazy thing about it</text>
  <text start="414.01" dur="5.67">is what&amp;#39;s driving already nuts is</text>
  <text start="416.139" dur="7.441">you normally when you investigate like</text>
  <text start="419.68" dur="6.09">let&amp;#39;s say a crime family so you have out</text>
  <text start="423.58" dur="4.26">you have a crime family of a syndicate</text>
  <text start="425.77" dur="3.929">you have a bunch of players you have</text>
  <text start="427.84" dur="4.229">some bosses and some lower-level people</text>
  <text start="429.699" dur="5.761">and you develop you go do some</text>
  <text start="432.069" dur="5.91">investigation you find out how are they</text>
  <text start="435.46" dur="4.53">doing this you get information you get</text>
  <text start="437.979" dur="3.9">personal documents you take photographs</text>
  <text start="439.99" dur="3.959">you interview people you do this</text>
  <text start="441.879" dur="4.16">elaborate investigation usually takes a</text>
  <text start="443.949" dur="5.511">year or two or three years worth of work</text>
  <text start="446.039" dur="6.78">looking through court documents and</text>
  <text start="449.46" dur="8.079">tracking down all of the data and</text>
  <text start="452.819" dur="6.431">information to bring this to prosecution</text>
  <text start="457.539" dur="3.291">to or lace them up with a theory about</text>
  <text start="459.25" dur="5.969">what&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="460.83" dur="6.82">normally that information is not given</text>
  <text start="465.219" dur="5.13">to the public until the investigation</text>
  <text start="467.65" dur="5.25">has been done and a person will then</text>
  <text start="470.349" dur="4.44">take all that information and write an</text>
  <text start="472.9" dur="4.799">article or a series of articles or maybe</text>
  <text start="474.789" dur="4.771">a book on the investigation what they</text>
  <text start="477.699" dur="5.101">found what their conclusions were it</text>
  <text start="479.56" dur="7.469">will go to a jury right normally you</text>
  <text start="482.8" dur="6.269">don&amp;#39;t see the investigation work you</text>
  <text start="487.029" dur="4.56">read about it after the investigation is</text>
  <text start="489.069" dur="5.81">done what you&amp;#39;re seeing with George Webb</text>
  <text start="491.589" dur="8.371">is watching the investigation go on</text>
  <text start="494.879" dur="8.621">every day not now for the first five or</text>
  <text start="499.96" dur="5.699">six months on YouTube George would do</text>
  <text start="503.5" dur="3.779">his investigation and then he would</text>
  <text start="505.659" dur="3.961">report at the end of the day on a</text>
  <text start="507.279" dur="5.041">computer screen this is what I found</text>

  <text start="692.74" dur="3.65">comment and and call in if you want and</text>
  <text start="695.41" dur="3.75">talk to them and give them information</text>
  <text start="696.39" dur="5.98">so it&amp;#39;s a very interesting way to</text>
  <text start="699.16" dur="4.74">investigate just put in search engine</text>
  <text start="702.37" dur="3.03">crowd source of truth or put it in</text>
  <text start="703.9" dur="4.14">YouTube you&amp;#39;ll come up with Jason</text>
  <text start="705.4" dur="4.439">Goodman&amp;#39;s channel and he has been live</text>

  <text start="712.36" dur="5.34">five days probably I subscribed so I get</text>
  <text start="715.51" dur="5.4">notifications when he goes live the</text>
  <text start="717.7" dur="6.389">thing is it&amp;#39;s a bit of a mess they are</text>
  <text start="720.91" dur="7.35">doing some things in a way that is</text>
  <text start="724.089" dur="5.611">probably not the best way to do it you</text>
  <text start="728.26" dur="4.29">have to realize you guys are amateur</text>
  <text start="729.7" dur="4.02">investigators and sometimes they put</text>
  <text start="732.55" dur="2.789">information out that they probably</text>
  <text start="733.72" dur="3.9">shouldn&amp;#39;t put out right away they should</text>
  <text start="735.339" dur="4.831">probably sit on it things like phone</text>
  <text start="737.62" dur="3.99">numbers things like email addresses some</text>
  <text start="740.17" dur="2.94">data that they&amp;#39;re putting on I think</text>
  <text start="741.61" dur="4.26">probably be better if it hadn&amp;#39;t gone on</text>
  <text start="743.11" dur="4.41">and George is the first to admit that if</text>
  <text start="745.87" dur="2.82">George screws up George will say you</text>
  <text start="747.52" dur="3.689">know I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t have put the</text>
  <text start="748.69" dur="5.16">cloud that was a mistake and I&amp;#39;m sorry</text>
  <text start="751.209" dur="5.701">and I apologize and I wasn&amp;#39;t thinking</text>
  <text start="753.85" dur="5.25">clearly so at least George will own up</text>
  <text start="756.91" dur="3.929">to his mistakes but it is it was a</text>
  <text start="759.1" dur="5.429">little bit crazy watching what&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="760.839" dur="4.081">on now George is trying to save the</text>
  <text start="764.529" dur="3.271">country</text>
  <text start="764.92" dur="5.789">I respect George he&amp;#39;s putting his life</text>

  <text start="825.92" dur="5.49">this but I&amp;#39;m going to tell you it ever</text>
  <text start="829.459" dur="4.651">since the beginning of George&amp;#39;s series I</text>
  <text start="831.41" dur="7.41">thought about writing a book based on</text>
  <text start="834.11" dur="8.31">his work I sent him an email I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="838.82" dur="5.699">know if he got it but I would love to</text>
  <text start="842.42" dur="5.099">collaborate with George on writing a</text>

  <text start="850.37" dur="4.8">even if even if he doesn&amp;#39;t collaborate</text>
  <text start="852.98" dur="3.45">with me I still only end up writing a</text>
  <text start="855.17" dur="5.19">book because I find it a very</text>
  <text start="856.43" dur="8.19">fascinating story and you know here&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="860.36" dur="8.94">thing with my books I take complex ideas</text>
  <text start="864.62" dur="6.48">and I make them simple so you know where</text>
  <text start="869.3" dur="4.589">is Erik Braverman made simple I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="871.1" dur="5.549">know I I think would be very helpful for</text>
  <text start="873.889" dur="5.371">someone who has an ability to take</text>
  <text start="876.649" dur="4.88">complex scenarios and situations and</text>
  <text start="879.26" dur="5.16">simple simplify them and break them down</text>
  <text start="881.529" dur="5.191">I&amp;#39;m I am thinking about doing that</text>
  <text start="884.42" dur="5.96">thinking about possibly writing a book</text>
  <text start="886.72" dur="5.53">detailing all of this history and</text>
  <text start="890.38" dur="4.6">explaining it in a way that the average</text>
  <text start="892.25" dur="5.279">person can understand it I have to tell</text>
  <text start="894.98" dur="6.87">you this I&amp;#39;ve had three dreams about</text>
  <text start="897.529" dur="7.5">George Webb in the last four days the</text>
  <text start="901.85" dur="6.06">last two or three dreams all I can</text>
  <text start="905.029" dur="6.42">describe about those dreams was there</text>
  <text start="907.91" dur="7.53">was absolute confusion it was just</text>
  <text start="911.449" dur="5.88">confusion I saw scene after scene after</text>
  <text start="915.44" dur="3.24">scene and what was happening in the</text>
  <text start="917.329" dur="2.161">scene didn&amp;#39;t make any sense this</text>
  <text start="918.68" dur="2.58">confusing</text>
  <text start="919.49" dur="3.9">he wouldn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on it was</text>
  <text start="921.26" dur="4.199">just it was a mess right it&amp;#39;s a little</text>
  <text start="923.39" dur="3.54">bit like what&amp;#39;s actually happening if</text>
  <text start="925.459" dur="3.331">you&amp;#39;re watching these guys and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="926.93" dur="4.5">following them on YouTube or periscope</text>
  <text start="928.79" dur="5.22">it&amp;#39;s a mess you&amp;#39;re like what are they</text>
  <text start="931.43" dur="4.95">talking about if all this jargon they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="934.01" dur="4.43">making these connections and sometimes</text>
  <text start="936.38" dur="3.959">they make mistakes and it&amp;#39;s confusing</text>
  <text start="938.44" dur="5.5">especially if you haven&amp;#39;t been following</text>
  <text start="940.339" dur="5.671">the series so the last two or three</text>
  <text start="943.94" dur="5.53">dreams ahead there was just confusion</text>
  <text start="946.01" dur="6.73">wide widespread confusion but the first</text>
  <text start="949.47" dur="6.12">that I had in that dream I saw George</text>
  <text start="952.74" dur="6.03">and he stumbled upon a discovery that</text>
  <text start="955.59" dur="8.39">was shocking to him he had uncovered</text>
  <text start="958.77" dur="8.1">something that he did not expect and I</text>
  <text start="963.98" dur="5.05">could see he was just he was just amazed</text>
  <text start="966.87" dur="4.67">and what I believe that dream</text>
  <text start="969.03" dur="7.65">illustrates is the is the fact that</text>
  <text start="971.54" dur="7.77">George is going to uncover and be</text>
  <text start="976.68" dur="6.75">vindicated he&amp;#39;s going to find something</text>
  <text start="979.31" dur="7.39">huge he will be recognized as a person</text>
  <text start="983.43" dur="6.27">who uncovered something incredibly</text>
  <text start="986.7" dur="5.64">relevant and important to our generation</text>
  <text start="989.7" dur="4.08">to our nation into the world say what</text>
  <text start="992.34" dur="4.53">you want that you think George is a</text>
  <text start="993.78" dur="7.83">conspiracy theorist look there either is</text>
  <text start="996.87" dur="7.83">or is not a conspiracy in the government</text>
  <text start="1001.61" dur="6.78">and in these nonprofits and in these</text>
  <text start="1004.7" dur="7.2">private companies a conspiracy to rip</text>
  <text start="1008.39" dur="5.25">people off to kill extort profit at the</text>
  <text start="1011.9" dur="3.96">loss of other people they have conspired</text>
  <text start="1013.64" dur="5.22">to do that or they have not conspired to</text>
  <text start="1015.86" dur="6.36">do that and George is working on the</text>
  <text start="1018.86" dur="6.63">theory that there is a conspiracy among</text>
  <text start="1022.22" dur="5.01">these agencies to do all this stuff so</text>
  <text start="1025.49" dur="6.42">you can call it conspiracy theory if you</text>
  <text start="1027.23" dur="6.63">want to that&amp;#39;s fine but I I believe his</text>
  <text start="1031.91" dur="5.31">work is going to be vindicated and I</text>
  <text start="1033.86" dur="5.91">believe it&amp;#39;s not just about Seth rich</text>
  <text start="1037.22" dur="5.61">and it&amp;#39;s not just about Erik Braverman</text>
  <text start="1039.77" dur="6.3">not just about the Awan brothers which</text>
  <text start="1042.83" dur="6.32">by the way the one brothers are making a</text>
  <text start="1046.07" dur="7.68">splash that story is not going away it</text>
  <text start="1049.15" dur="10.87">is leaking out the people involved in</text>
  <text start="1053.75" dur="8.55">the House Congress are very very nervous</text>
  <text start="1060.02" dur="3.3">about what&amp;#39;s going on the Awan brothers</text>
  <text start="1062.3" dur="3.69">okay</text>
  <text start="1063.32" dur="5.79">George has exposed is shined a light a</text>
  <text start="1065.99" dur="4.91">lot of very sketchy corrupt things that</text>
  <text start="1069.11" dur="4.71">have been going on for a long time and</text>
  <text start="1070.9" dur="6.43">he is he will be vindicated one of these</text>
  <text start="1073.82" dur="5.25">days his his stories will get out law</text>
  <text start="1077.33" dur="4.74">enforcement will or is going to arrest</text>
  <text start="1079.07" dur="6.78">these people and you know</text>
  <text start="1082.07" dur="5.67">the human happening situation George has</text>
  <text start="1085.85" dur="3.98">provided a lot of good insights into</text>
  <text start="1087.74" dur="5.01">what&amp;#39;s going on through my Abadie and</text>
  <text start="1089.83" dur="4.839">Anthony Weiner and Hillary Clinton and</text>
  <text start="1092.75" dur="4.83">now we find out in the last few days</text>
  <text start="1094.669" dur="6.601">more Hillary Clinton emails came out and</text>
  <text start="1097.58" dur="6.66">WikiLeaks just published them this stuff</text>

  <text start="1104.24" dur="4.35">away it is not going to be swept under</text>
  <text start="1105.679" dur="4.861">the rug eventually it&amp;#39;s all going to</text>
  <text start="1108.59" dur="4.65">come out and it&amp;#39;s going to be prosecuted</text>
  <text start="1110.54" dur="3.93">a lot of it well maybe not all of it but</text>
  <text start="1113.24" dur="3.319">a lot of these people I think are going</text>
  <text start="1114.47" dur="4.35">to end up getting prosecuted look</text>
  <text start="1116.559" dur="4.811">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people know about it</text>
  <text start="1118.82" dur="3.84">now there are thousands of people all</text>
  <text start="1121.37" dur="3.78">over the world have been watching the</text>

  <text start="1135.89" dur="3.6">going to go away it&amp;#39;s going to stay out</text>
  <text start="1137.69" dur="4.97">there and there is going to be more</text>
  <text start="1139.49" dur="7.37">uncovered a drew McCabe who is the</text>

  <text start="1152.059" dur="4.051">actually under investigation by the</text>
  <text start="1154.4" dur="4.11">Department of Justice Office of</text>

  <text start="1174.32" dur="8.67">did not recuse himself from an email</text>
  <text start="1178.16" dur="7.23">investigation so there&amp;#39;s a appearance of</text>

  <text start="1185.39" dur="4.71">McCabe is being investigated for right</text>
  <text start="1188.059" dur="5.671">now you want to know the really funny</text>
  <text start="1190.1" dur="6.06">thing is the investigation is being run</text>
  <text start="1193.73" dur="6.03">by the Office of Inspector General it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1196.16" dur="6">also under the oversight of the Senate</text>

  <text start="1236.179" dur="4.35">and nothing is being done about them the</text>

  <text start="1240.529" dur="4.291">involved are complicit and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1242.929" dur="4.561">want the truth to be found out they do</text>
  <text start="1244.82" dur="4.609">not want their actions to be uncovered</text>
  <text start="1247.49" dur="5.58">so they&amp;#39;re delaying as long as they can</text>
  <text start="1249.429" dur="9.401">Andrew McCabe acting director of the FBI</text>

  <text start="1261.529" dur="5.37">and this whole thing is going to get</text>
  <text start="1264.049" dur="6">very strange because oh you know</text>
  <text start="1266.899" dur="6.541">insiders in Washington expected that the</text>

  <text start="1284.08" dur="5.679">what I see is the FBI is kind of a mess</text>

  <text start="1351.95" dur="9.87">years there is a scathing report by in</text>
  <text start="1356.18" dur="9.24">by an independent auditor who cited</text>
  <text start="1361.82" dur="8.94">hundreds of cases of abuse of the FISA</text>
  <text start="1365.42" dur="8.63">Court by the FBI the FBI is has been</text>
  <text start="1370.76" dur="5.46">abusing its ability to investigate it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1374.05" dur="6.79">essentially what what happens is this</text>
  <text start="1376.22" dur="6.33">if the FBI or the CIA want to do</text>
  <text start="1380.84" dur="4.77">surveillance that they want to gather</text>
  <text start="1382.55" dur="7.76">your personal information they need to</text>
  <text start="1385.61" dur="8.67">get a warrant from a court and that</text>
  <text start="1390.31" dur="6.46">requires a detailed explanation about</text>
  <text start="1394.28" dur="4.77">why you want this information you have</text>
  <text start="1396.77" dur="5.19">to show probable cause it&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="1399.05" dur="5.52">Hoops to jump through so whenever an</text>
  <text start="1401.96" dur="4.82">intelligence agency wants to get</text>
  <text start="1404.57" dur="7.47">information on you they have two choices</text>
  <text start="1406.78" dur="7.42">they can either do it legally and fill</text>
  <text start="1412.04" dur="5.07">out the forms and go to court and get it</text>
  <text start="1414.2" dur="6.3">order a warrant to do the surveillance</text>
  <text start="1417.11" dur="5.67">or they can go to the FISA Court and</text>
  <text start="1420.5" dur="4.14">they can ask the FISA Court and say hey</text>
  <text start="1422.78" dur="6.51">this person has been talking to someone</text>
  <text start="1424.64" dur="6.3">over in Russia or Somalia or UK wherever</text>
  <text start="1429.29" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t it can be anywhere well is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1430.94" dur="3.27">another nation and we want to surveil</text>
  <text start="1432.98" dur="1.71">that person and we want to find out what</text>
  <text start="1434.21" dur="2.61">they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1434.69" dur="4.59">you go to FISA Court you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1436.82" dur="5.28">show cause you know the restrictions are</text>
  <text start="1439.28" dur="5.76">minimal and it&amp;#39;s almost always granted</text>
  <text start="1442.1" dur="7.86">so what it seems like is the FBI has</text>
  <text start="1445.04" dur="8.04">been abusing this easy almost foolproof</text>
  <text start="1449.96" dur="7.26">way to get permission to do surveillance</text>
  <text start="1453.08" dur="5.82">on American citizens that is kind of a</text>
  <text start="1457.22" dur="4.17">scandal that has been breaking over the</text>
  <text start="1458.9" dur="4.83">last week or two and we&amp;#39;re going to be</text>

  <text start="1492.78" dur="6.9">anything changed why do these abuses</text>
  <text start="1496.11" dur="6.03">continue that is what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="1499.68" dur="5.49">on Wednesday and the other thing is so</text>

  <text start="1510.06" dur="7.23">questions probably about why he felt</text>
  <text start="1515.52" dur="3">James Comey needed to be fired there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1517.29" dur="4.14">two things that they&amp;#39;re investigating</text>

  <text start="1530.19" dur="4.56">FISA Court</text>
  <text start="1531.08" dur="6.96">so with McCade and Rosen Stein it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1534.75" dur="7.35">probably going to be mostly focused on</text>
  <text start="1538.04" dur="5.59">the firing of Comey but Kay will be</text>
  <text start="1542.1" dur="3.21">answering questions about what&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1543.63" dur="7.53">happening the FBI since that since is</text>
  <text start="1545.31" dur="9.42">firing and was there attempts by Trump</text>

  <text start="1554.73" dur="4.71">the Trump Russia thing okay the Trump</text>
  <text start="1557.31" dur="4.98">Russia investigation is a big issue</text>
  <text start="1559.44" dur="7.38">right now so they&amp;#39;ll be questioning</text>
  <text start="1562.29" dur="7.98">McCain wanting to know is he has been</text>
  <text start="1566.82" dur="5.61">aware of any attempts to stop the</text>
  <text start="1570.27" dur="5.1">investigation McCain has already</text>
  <text start="1572.43" dur="5.22">testified there has not been any attempt</text>
  <text start="1575.37" dur="5.49">to stop the investigation we had that</text>
  <text start="1577.65" dur="6.42">sworn testimony under oath in previous</text>
  <text start="1580.86" dur="6.27">series Rosen Stein will also be asked</text>
  <text start="1584.07" dur="4.86">questions about his rationale and what</text>
  <text start="1587.13" dur="3.39">he observed about McCabe and why was</text>
  <text start="1588.93" dur="6.23">McCabe fire because they&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="1590.52" dur="7.23">find out did Trump fire Comey as</text>
  <text start="1595.16" dur="4.12">retaliation or as a way to stop this</text>
  <text start="1597.75" dur="3.87">investigation that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="1599.28" dur="4.89">to get at okay so that&amp;#39;s going to be</text>

  <text start="1608.46" dur="5.09">testifying on Wednesday that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1610.95" dur="5.76">going to be more related to FISA</text>
  <text start="1613.55" dur="6.55">surveillance and use of intelligence on</text>
  <text start="1616.71" dur="5.699">masking who has been unmasked we saw</text>
  <text start="1620.1" dur="2.88">this with Brennan and clapper a couple</text>
  <text start="1622.409" dur="3.421">weeks ago</text>

  <text start="1639.659" dur="5.821">to the public and this may be just a</text>
  <text start="1643.559" dur="3.661">whole lot of YouTube theater I don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1649.89" dur="5.519">closed hearing as well as we&amp;#39;ll see I</text>
  <text start="1653.399" dur="4.321">don&amp;#39;t expect that there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="1655.409" dur="4.981">lot of forthcoming information on that</text>
  <text start="1657.72" dur="4.38">there may be if they don&amp;#39;t get the</text>
  <text start="1660.39" dur="3.57">answers they want in the open hearing</text>
  <text start="1662.1" dur="4.5">they&amp;#39;ll have a closer and they&amp;#39;ll go and</text>
  <text start="1663.96" dur="5.61">get the answers of this entity now</text>
  <text start="1666.6" dur="5.37">combing is scheduled to testify on</text>
  <text start="1669.57" dur="6.03">Thursday the day after</text>
  <text start="1671.97" dur="6.42">McCabe Rosenstein Coates and Rogers</text>
  <text start="1675.6" dur="7.35">testify Comey was scheduled to testify</text>
  <text start="1678.39" dur="7.35">the next day I am not actually under the</text>
  <text start="1682.95" dur="6.479">impression right now that Comey is</text>
  <text start="1685.74" dur="6.689">actually going to testify look if I were</text>
  <text start="1689.429" dur="5.73">James Comey I would not testify there is</text>
  <text start="1692.429" dur="5.911">no way I would go into that hearing and</text>
  <text start="1695.159" dur="5.701">testify he has nothing to gain and</text>
  <text start="1698.34" dur="5.75">everything to lose by testifying</text>
  <text start="1700.86" dur="5.58">every time Comey goes in front of a</text>
  <text start="1704.09" dur="4.24">Intelligence Committee hearing and goes</text>
  <text start="1706.44" dur="5.76">under oath and has asked questions he</text>
  <text start="1708.33" dur="6">has another opportunity to contradict</text>
  <text start="1712.2" dur="5.79">himself on something he&amp;#39;s already said</text>
  <text start="1714.33" dur="6.719">under oath and I think that maybe if he</text>
  <text start="1717.99" dur="6.689">does testify on Thursday it&amp;#39;s expected</text>
  <text start="1721.049" dur="8.51">that he is going to testify and say that</text>
  <text start="1724.679" dur="8.691">Trump put pressure on him to delay or</text>
  <text start="1729.559" dur="7.681">stop the investigation into Flint and</text>
  <text start="1733.37" dur="7.9">any Russia connections if Comey</text>
  <text start="1737.24" dur="8.38">testifies that there was pressure put on</text>
  <text start="1741.27" dur="6.99">him by the President to squelch squash</text>
  <text start="1745.62" dur="4.65">or interfere with any investigation if</text>
  <text start="1748.26" dur="2.52">Comey says yeah I felt like the</text>
  <text start="1750.27" dur="2.97">president</text>
  <text start="1750.78" dur="6.3">was trying to get me to stop these</text>
  <text start="1753.24" dur="6.72">investigations he will be contradicting</text>
  <text start="1757.08" dur="6.06">himself in previous testimony he has</text>
  <text start="1759.96" dur="4.95">already said under oath there were no</text>
  <text start="1763.14" dur="2.97">attempts and there was no pressure to</text>
  <text start="1764.91" dur="3.69">stop the investigations</text>
  <text start="1766.11" dur="4.55">so he&amp;#39;ll contradict himself and then he</text>
  <text start="1768.6" dur="5.37">could probably be charged with perjury</text>
  <text start="1770.66" dur="6.16">the other problem he has is that if he</text>
  <text start="1773.97" dur="5.22">says there was an attempt by trunk or</text>
  <text start="1776.82" dur="6.03">someone in the Trump administration to</text>
  <text start="1779.19" dur="6.06">stop this investigation he is legally</text>
  <text start="1782.85" dur="5.19">obligated to report that to his</text>
  <text start="1785.25" dur="5.07">supervisor who is the Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="1788.04" dur="4.92">General he has to report any</text>
  <text start="1790.32" dur="5.9">interference to the DOJ he&amp;#39;s legally</text>
  <text start="1792.96" dur="6.21">obligated if he knew there was an</text>
  <text start="1796.22" dur="5.5">attempt to interfere with an</text>
  <text start="1799.17" dur="6.12">investigation and didn&amp;#39;t report it he</text>
  <text start="1801.72" dur="6.06">can be charged unless Comey goes into</text>
  <text start="1805.29" dur="6.45">that hearing and says there was no</text>
  <text start="1807.78" dur="6.78">attempt to stop the investigation Trump</text>
  <text start="1811.74" dur="5.49">never pressured me if he if he goes in</text>
  <text start="1814.56" dur="4.98">there and says that he&amp;#39;ll be ok if he</text>
  <text start="1817.23" dur="4.89">tries to make it look as the Trump tried</text>
  <text start="1819.54" dur="5.31">to stop the investigation he is going to</text>
  <text start="1822.12" dur="5.67">be in a lot of trouble because he&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1824.85" dur="6">he&amp;#39;s already said there was no attempt</text>
  <text start="1827.79" dur="4.53">to do that so if I were Comey I would</text>
  <text start="1830.85" dur="5.31">not show up at that hearing on Thursday</text>
  <text start="1832.32" dur="7.47">he can talk to Robert Mueller who is</text>
  <text start="1836.16" dur="5.55">this special counsel and have the others</text>
  <text start="1839.79" dur="3.84">say hey you can&amp;#39;t testify or something I</text>
  <text start="1841.71" dur="3.72">would find a way to get out of that but</text>
  <text start="1843.63" dur="4.29">if he goes in if Comey goes in and</text>
  <text start="1845.43" dur="5.82">testifies on Thursday he is taking a</text>
  <text start="1847.92" dur="6.3">huge risk of essentially political</text>
  <text start="1851.25" dur="7.77">suicide so I guess we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="1854.22" dur="8.12">what happens the other thing to think</text>
  <text start="1859.02" dur="6.48">about this week is now we know last week</text>
  <text start="1862.34" dur="6.13">the story was broken that Devon Nunez</text>
  <text start="1865.5" dur="5.57">who is the chair of the House</text>
  <text start="1868.47" dur="7.47">Intelligence Committee meeting is</text>
  <text start="1871.07" dur="8.97">subpoenaed the FBI CIA and NSA wanting</text>
  <text start="1875.94" dur="7.59">to know who was unmasked by John Brennan</text>
  <text start="1880.04" dur="4.18">Susan Rice and Samantha power during</text>
  <text start="1883.53" dur="3.81">2000</text>
  <text start="1884.22" dur="4.589">see so the intelligence committee once</text>
  <text start="1887.34" dur="3.63">said is getting into more of this</text>
  <text start="1888.809" dur="5.791">unmasking they won and other names of</text>
  <text start="1890.97" dur="6.569">the people that run mass by Brennan rice</text>
  <text start="1894.6" dur="5.22">and Power Hour was the former ambassador</text>
  <text start="1897.539" dur="4.051">to the UN and people are kind of</text>
  <text start="1899.82" dur="4.109">wondering like why would the ambassador</text>
  <text start="1901.59" dur="5.13">to the UN have any reason to have</text>
  <text start="1903.929" dur="3.271">somebody&amp;#39;s name unmasked in intelligence</text>
  <text start="1906.72" dur="5.97">gathering</text>
  <text start="1907.2" dur="8.7">so Nunez has put out a subpoena to get</text>
  <text start="1912.69" dur="8.9">that information and to make matters</text>
  <text start="1915.9" dur="9.24">worse there is the FBI is actually under</text>
  <text start="1921.59" dur="6.01">order to reproduce a report concerning</text>
  <text start="1925.14" dur="4.919">their their compliance with the FISA</text>
  <text start="1927.6" dur="5.28">Court they have to produce a report and</text>
  <text start="1930.059" dur="4.141">this report has been demanded over and</text>
  <text start="1932.88" dur="5.21">over and over again and hasn&amp;#39;t shown up</text>
  <text start="1934.2" dur="6.18">I think and the date for that FISA</text>
  <text start="1938.09" dur="4.03">report is coming up in the next couple</text>
  <text start="1940.38" dur="4.98">of weeks I think it might be June 12th</text>
  <text start="1942.12" dur="5.1">or June 17th if that report comes out</text>
  <text start="1945.36" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;ll have know a lot more information</text>
  <text start="1947.22" dur="6.18">about what is going on with FISA and the</text>
  <text start="1950.25" dur="6.929">FBI look right now it&amp;#39;s looking as if</text>
  <text start="1953.4" dur="6.96">and people like trey Gowdy and Devon</text>
  <text start="1957.179" dur="6.63">Nunez have a very difficult job ahead of</text>
  <text start="1960.36" dur="6.96">them it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s possible they may be</text>
  <text start="1963.809" dur="7.471">asked not to reauthorize the 702 the 702</text>
  <text start="1967.32" dur="6.359">is the code for the FISA Court for some</text>
  <text start="1971.28" dur="4.86">people have said that this FISA Court is</text>
  <text start="1973.679" dur="4.021">actually not constitutional and there</text>
  <text start="1976.14" dur="4.25">really should we shouldn&amp;#39;t even have</text>
  <text start="1977.7" dur="6">this court they shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this</text>
  <text start="1980.39" dur="7.539">with the abuses that have come out of</text>
  <text start="1983.7" dur="5.88">the FISA Court there is a very good</text>
  <text start="1987.929" dur="5.88">argument to do away with it completely</text>
  <text start="1989.58" dur="5.64">and if that happens it&amp;#39;s going to hamper</text>
  <text start="1993.809" dur="3.511">the ability of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="1995.22" dur="4.29">community to gather this information not</text>
  <text start="1997.32" dur="5.219">that they can&amp;#39;t get the information but</text>
  <text start="1999.51" dur="4.86">FISA Court is a legal process that</text>
  <text start="2002.539" dur="4.38">allows them to do things with the</text>
  <text start="2004.37" dur="3.929">information they have and because</text>
  <text start="2006.919" dur="1.681">they&amp;#39;ve abused it and they get taken</text>
  <text start="2008.299" dur="4.791">away</text>
