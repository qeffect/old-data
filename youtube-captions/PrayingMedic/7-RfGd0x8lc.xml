  <text start="12.23" dur="5.379">encouraging I think some I have some</text>
  <text start="14.519" dur="5.821">encouraging observations about President</text>
  <text start="17.609" dur="7.111">Trump Jeff Sessions and Inspector</text>
  <text start="20.34" dur="5.849">General Michael Horowitz and I&amp;#39;m just</text>
  <text start="24.72" dur="3.51">gonna you know people have been</text>
  <text start="26.189" dur="6.511">concerned about that ever since they saw</text>
  <text start="28.23" dur="6.48">the president tweet out about sessions</text>
  <text start="32.7" dur="3.99">and the Department of Justice and</text>
  <text start="34.71" dur="5.46">Horowitz isn&amp;#39;t that guy an Obama</text>
  <text start="36.69" dur="7.529">appointee and why doesn&amp;#39;t sessions just</text>
  <text start="40.17" dur="6.209">have his own attorneys prosecute</text>
  <text start="44.219" dur="4.951">Horowitz doesn&amp;#39;t have any any</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="6.41">jurisdiction over that so people have</text>
  <text start="49.17" dur="6.15">taken that tweet from the president and</text>
  <text start="52.789" dur="5.711">they have jumped to the conclusion that</text>
  <text start="55.32" dur="4.68">oh no we can&amp;#39;t trust Jeff Sessions we</text>
  <text start="58.5" dur="1.92">can&amp;#39;t trust Horowitz the Inspector</text>
  <text start="60" dur="2.699">General</text>
  <text start="60.42" dur="4.529">oh no this is terrible this is worse</text>
  <text start="62.699" dur="6.571">than we ever thought it would be I would</text>
  <text start="64.949" dur="7.081">just caution you when you&amp;#39;re looking at</text>
  <text start="69.27" dur="4.139">president Trump&amp;#39;s tweets and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="72.03" dur="3.51">looking at what he says I would just</text>
  <text start="73.409" dur="4.621">caution you to realize that the</text>
  <text start="75.54" dur="5.13">president is always speaking to two or</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="5.85">three different audiences he has a</text>
  <text start="80.67" dur="5.54">message for the press he has a message</text>
  <text start="83.88" dur="8.04">for Congress and he has a message to us</text>
  <text start="86.21" dur="8.71">okay and if you take the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="91.92" dur="5.699">message to the press and you take that</text>
  <text start="94.92" dur="5.01">as your message you are going to be</text>
  <text start="97.619" dur="3.271">confused you&amp;#39;re not going to you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="99.93" dur="3.02">going to be disheartened and discouraged</text>
  <text start="100.89" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re not going to know what to make of</text>
  <text start="102.95" dur="4.93">the president&amp;#39;s message because it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="105.54" dur="8.25">intended for you it&amp;#39;s intended for the</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="11.519">press all right so what I would say is</text>
  <text start="113.79" dur="7.829">this you have to understand the</text>
  <text start="119.399" dur="5.4">president has been playing sort of a</text>
  <text start="121.619" dur="6.51">game with the media and Congress ever</text>
  <text start="124.799" dur="7.41">since he got elected the most recent</text>
  <text start="128.129" dur="5.401">message that the president put out about</text>
  <text start="132.209" dur="5.011">Jeff session</text>
  <text start="133.53" dur="6.84">and Horowitz and the idea that he</text>
  <text start="137.22" dur="5.88">doesn&amp;#39;t trust them is intended for the</text>
  <text start="140.37" dur="4.11">press and maybe for members of Congress</text>
  <text start="143.1" dur="6.6">but not for us</text>
  <text start="144.48" dur="7.77">the inspector general&amp;#39;s investigation we</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="4.44">have known for a while that the</text>
  <text start="152.25" dur="5.459">Inspector General has been investigating</text>
  <text start="154.14" dur="5.79">a number of things inside the FBI in the</text>
  <text start="157.709" dur="4.591">Department of Justice you have to</text>
  <text start="159.93" dur="5.279">understand that there are many things</text>
  <text start="162.3" dur="5.04">that President can&amp;#39;t tell us about Jeff</text>
  <text start="165.209" dur="5.671">Sessions his attorney general because</text>
  <text start="167.34" dur="4.74">sessions recused himself from most</text>
  <text start="170.88" dur="1.88">everything that has to do with the</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="5.94">election</text>
  <text start="172.76" dur="7.72">all right so because the president and</text>
  <text start="178.02" dur="3.81">Jeff Sessions have this weird</text>
  <text start="180.48" dur="3.509">relationship where they can&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="181.83" dur="4.32">really be seen publicly talking if</text>
  <text start="183.989" dur="4.891">sessions and and Trump went out to lunch</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="7.61">together the media would have a fit they</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="6.6">would accuse Trump of meddling in some</text>
  <text start="193.76" dur="2.86">Department of Justice saying that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.48" dur="1.92">not supposed to be meddling and and look</text>
  <text start="196.62" dur="2.97">here&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="197.4" dur="4.47">it&amp;#39;s ridiculous from the beginning</text>
  <text start="199.59" dur="4.04">because the President as the chief</text>
  <text start="201.87" dur="4.95">executive of the executive branch</text>
  <text start="203.63" dur="7.05">Department of Justice and FBI are under</text>
  <text start="206.82" dur="6.83">the executive branch he is the ultimate</text>
  <text start="210.68" dur="7.96">person at the top of the DOJ and the FBI</text>
  <text start="213.65" dur="5.649">however the press wants to make a storm</text>
  <text start="218.64" dur="4.409">out of everything</text>
  <text start="219.299" dur="6.361">a scandal president Trump is in a very</text>
  <text start="223.049" dur="4.081">unusual situation with respect to Jeff</text>
  <text start="225.66" dur="4.62">Sessions in the Department of Justice in</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="5.37">that he can&amp;#39;t be seen meddling in their</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="4.29">affairs certainly not by the press and</text>
  <text start="232.5" dur="4.89">not by Congress otherwise he&amp;#39;ll have to</text>
  <text start="234.57" dur="5.46">face all these accusations of you know</text>
  <text start="237.39" dur="6.78">being a meddler and being corrupt and</text>
  <text start="240.03" dur="7.47">being a tyrant right so Trump has to</text>
  <text start="244.17" dur="7.5">have a hands-off approach with Jeff</text>
  <text start="247.5" dur="9.44">sessions in the DOJ at least for now he</text>
  <text start="251.67" dur="9.03">has to that&amp;#39;s just what&amp;#39;s expected so</text>
  <text start="256.94" dur="6.37">out of the blue President Trump goes on</text>
  <text start="260.7" dur="4.68">Twitter and tweets about the Department</text>
  <text start="263.31" dur="3.9">of Justice Inspector General Michael</text>
  <text start="265.38" dur="3.39">Horowitz out of the blue</text>
  <text start="267.21" dur="3.59">hey you know what I think I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="268.77" dur="4.739">tweet about the Inspector General</text>
  <text start="270.8" dur="4.63">why would the president out of the blue</text>
  <text start="273.509" dur="4.47">tweet about the Inspector General number</text>
  <text start="275.43" dur="6.12">one you have to ask yourself critical</text>
  <text start="277.979" dur="6.351">thinking why why does Trump all of a</text>
  <text start="281.55" dur="3.989">sudden unprovoked start tweeting about</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="5.07">Horowitz</text>
  <text start="285.539" dur="7.88">what&amp;#39;s going on well we know from past</text>
  <text start="289.4" dur="8.17">reports that the inspector general&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="7.18">report on politicization of the FBI in</text>
  <text start="297.57" dur="6.18">the Department of Justice Comey Holder</text>
  <text start="300.599" dur="6.66">Lynch all those people the corruption</text>
  <text start="303.75" dur="5.759">the FISA abuse all it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all been</text>
  <text start="307.259" dur="5.391">investigated for the last year and we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="309.509" dur="6.961">been expecting Horowitz to have his</text>
  <text start="312.65" dur="6">report March or April there was a letter</text>
  <text start="316.47" dur="5.069">I think I don&amp;#39;t know if it was between</text>
  <text start="318.65" dur="5.019">Goodlatte or Chuck Grassley and the</text>
  <text start="321.539" dur="4.831">inspector general but the understanding</text>
  <text start="323.669" dur="5.941">was that he would Horowitz would have</text>
  <text start="326.37" dur="9.6">his report ready by March or April well</text>
  <text start="329.61" dur="8.01">today is March 1st so we&amp;#39;re coming in to</text>
  <text start="335.97" dur="3.54">March and we&amp;#39;re expecting these</text>
  <text start="337.62" dur="5.31">inspector general&amp;#39;s report to come out</text>
  <text start="339.51" dur="6.06">which I have been under the impression</text>
  <text start="342.93" dur="6">by all the stuff that&amp;#39;s coming out of</text>
  <text start="345.57" dur="7.969">the IGS office that where he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="348.93" dur="8.64">helping and assisting Devin Nunez and</text>
  <text start="353.539" dur="6.66">Grassley and Goodlatte in understand all</text>
  <text start="357.57" dur="5.31">the information that&amp;#39;s going on with the</text>
  <text start="360.199" dur="4.84">the politicization inside the FBI and</text>
  <text start="362.88" dur="4.469">Department of Justice I have been</text>
  <text start="365.039" dur="6.331">expecting that Horowitz is going to drop</text>
  <text start="367.349" dur="7.831">a nuclear bomb that&amp;#39;s going to recommend</text>
  <text start="371.37" dur="6.81">a special counsel that investigates</text>
  <text start="375.18" dur="6.18">those departments and probably some</text>
  <text start="378.18" dur="4.829">firing and maybe some prosecution all</text>
  <text start="381.36" dur="3.029">right that is what I&amp;#39;ve been expecting</text>
  <text start="383.009" dur="4.111">to come out of the inspector general</text>
  <text start="384.389" dur="5.31">report which is due March or April last</text>
  <text start="387.12" dur="5.82">we heard and Horowitz has been</text>
  <text start="389.699" dur="8.491">collaborating and working with Congress</text>
  <text start="392.94" dur="8.01">to expose the corruption so I have not</text>
  <text start="398.19" dur="5.31">seen any evidence at</text>
  <text start="400.95" dur="4.8">all in the last six months and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="403.5" dur="3.63">watching Horowitz and what&amp;#39;s coming out</text>
  <text start="405.75" dur="3">of there under his communications with</text>
  <text start="407.13" dur="4.38">the different congressional committees I</text>
  <text start="408.75" dur="7.41">haven&amp;#39;t seen one thing that gives me any</text>
  <text start="411.51" dur="7.49">concern that we can&amp;#39;t trust Horowitz to</text>
  <text start="416.16" dur="5.52">do the right thing</text>
  <text start="419" dur="4.81">so Trump tweets out and says hey</text>
  <text start="421.68" dur="3.38">Horowitz isn&amp;#39;t that guy some Obama</text>
  <text start="423.81" dur="4.89">appointee</text>
  <text start="425.06" dur="10.99">why would Trump talk trash about</text>
  <text start="428.7" dur="10.17">Horowitz publicly why would Trump talk</text>
  <text start="436.05" dur="5.64">trash about Horowitz publicly if we know</text>
  <text start="438.87" dur="6.72">or suspect that Horowitz is going to</text>
  <text start="441.69" dur="8.43">have a damaging report for the swamp and</text>
  <text start="445.59" dur="10.23">the FBI and the DOJ because this is</text>
  <text start="450.12" dur="7.17">strategic if Trump knows that inspector</text>
  <text start="455.82" dur="3.6">general reports coming out and if he</text>
  <text start="457.29" dur="4.68">knows it is going to be damaging to the</text>
  <text start="459.42" dur="6.78">FBI and DOJ and he knows it is going to</text>
  <text start="461.97" dur="6.63">clear him even further and exonerate him</text>
  <text start="466.2" dur="5.7">and prove that he was right he has to</text>
  <text start="468.6" dur="6.48">make the press think he doesn&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="471.9" dur="4.62">Horowitz and he doesn&amp;#39;t trust sessions</text>
  <text start="475.08" dur="2.96">and he doesn&amp;#39;t trust the Inspector</text>
  <text start="476.52" dur="6.06">General he doesn&amp;#39;t trust the process</text>
  <text start="478.04" dur="5.83">because if Trump signals to the media I</text>
  <text start="482.58" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t trust these guys</text>
  <text start="483.87" dur="3.54">I don&amp;#39;t trust sessions I don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="485.94" dur="3.51">Horowitz I don&amp;#39;t trust the Inspector</text>
  <text start="487.41" dur="4.17">General why why do we have to deal with</text>
  <text start="489.45" dur="5.52">it they don&amp;#39;t do anything there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="491.58" dur="5.37">not worth anything if Trump signals to</text>
  <text start="494.97" dur="7.53">the media if he doesn&amp;#39;t trust Horowitz</text>
  <text start="496.95" dur="7.98">and sessions the media will defend them</text>
  <text start="502.5" dur="4.29">the media will take their side the media</text>
  <text start="504.93" dur="4.41">will defend them and they&amp;#39;ll say oh no</text>
  <text start="506.79" dur="4.89">no we can trust Horowitz no no we trust</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="7.11">sessions you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re a bad dictator</text>
  <text start="511.68" dur="6.39">Trump you are Hitler you&amp;#39;re just trying</text>
  <text start="516.45" dur="5.34">to get rid of these good men and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="518.07" dur="5.82">trying to get off with your you know</text>
  <text start="521.79" dur="4.65">from your crimes and we&amp;#39;re gonna they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="523.89" dur="4.17">gonna impeach you Horowitz isn&amp;#39;t one</text>
  <text start="526.44" dur="6.63">this guy Muller didn&amp;#39;t do it we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="528.06" dur="6.65">get Horowitz to do it so in the same way</text>
  <text start="533.07" dur="5.96">that the president</text>
  <text start="534.71" dur="6.75">has maligned Robert Muller all through</text>
  <text start="539.03" dur="4.2">this investigation knowing darn well</text>
  <text start="541.46" dur="4.32">Muller was never going to recommend</text>
  <text start="543.23" dur="5.34">indictment of Trump Trump had to make</text>
  <text start="545.78" dur="4.62">Muller look like a bad guy for the press</text>
  <text start="548.57" dur="3.42">and for Congress</text>
  <text start="550.4" dur="2.79">even though Trump knew the whole time</text>
  <text start="551.99" dur="5.37">Muller was not going to get anything on</text>
  <text start="553.19" dur="7.47">him it was to Trump&amp;#39;s advantage to paint</text>
  <text start="557.36" dur="7.23">Muller as a bad guy so that the press</text>
  <text start="560.66" dur="6.78">would defend his decisions now knowing</text>
  <text start="564.59" dur="4.8">that you have to expect that Trump is</text>
  <text start="567.44" dur="4.05">gonna paint Horowitz as a bad guy and</text>
  <text start="569.39" dur="4.47">sessions as a bad guy because he wants</text>
  <text start="571.49" dur="4.62">the press to defend them so that when</text>
  <text start="573.86" dur="5.79">they come out and exonerate Trump and</text>
  <text start="576.11" dur="8.79">point the finger of guilt at Comey and</text>
  <text start="579.65" dur="8.85">McCabe and Strock and Lynch at Holder</text>
  <text start="584.9" dur="5.64">and everybody else if the press and</text>
  <text start="588.5" dur="6.05">Congress embraces the Department of</text>
  <text start="590.54" dur="7.02">Justice and Horowitz when Horowitz and</text>
  <text start="594.55" dur="4.15">sessions dropped the bomb it&amp;#39;s too late</text>
  <text start="597.56" dur="4.16">for the press to do anything</text>
  <text start="598.7" dur="6.93">they&amp;#39;ve already embraced the outcome and</text>
  <text start="601.72" dur="7.08">when the outcome happens so I believe</text>
  <text start="605.63" dur="7.5">Trump is leveraging this situation he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="608.8" dur="7.57">maneuvering in advance of that inspector</text>
  <text start="613.13" dur="7.23">general&amp;#39;s report coming out I think</text>
  <text start="616.37" dur="7.74">Trump is maneuvering to get people in</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="6.84">the press to trust Horowitz and Trust</text>
  <text start="624.11" dur="5.46">sessions so that when the report comes</text>
  <text start="627.2" dur="2.88">out they&amp;#39;re gonna have to they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="629.57" dur="3.42">have to own it</text>
  <text start="630.08" dur="6.63">there&amp;#39;s a lot of danger if you take</text>
  <text start="632.99" dur="5.37">Trump&amp;#39;s tweets at face value you have to</text>
  <text start="636.71" dur="3.9">understand he is very strategic and what</text>
  <text start="638.36" dur="4.32">he does and he when he&amp;#39;s trying to close</text>
  <text start="640.61" dur="4.59">a deal when he&amp;#39;s in the process of</text>
  <text start="642.68" dur="5.19">making a deal closing deal you can never</text>
  <text start="645.2" dur="5.04">get what he really wants as an outcome</text>
  <text start="647.87" dur="5.85">because all of his strategy and all of</text>
  <text start="650.24" dur="6.06">his tactics in the process of the deal</text>
  <text start="653.72" dur="4.47">are working toward an end goal that he</text>
  <text start="656.3" dur="4.26">has not told you about you don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="658.19" dur="4.08">what his end goal is all you can see is</text>
  <text start="660.56" dur="3.93">well he&amp;#39;s embracing this and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="662.27" dur="5.61">talking about that and he&amp;#39;s proposing</text>
  <text start="664.49" dur="3.96">this and if if you look at what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="667.88" dur="2.73">saying</text>
  <text start="668.45" dur="4.319">in the process you&amp;#39;re gonna get confused</text>
  <text start="670.61" dur="4.56">and that&amp;#39;s why people are upset at</text>
  <text start="672.769" dur="4.051">sessions oh sessions it&amp;#39;s a black hat</text>
  <text start="675.17" dur="3.27">now I have to have to take the white hat</text>
  <text start="676.82" dur="4.259">office sessions and put the black hat on</text>

  <text start="995.72" dur="4.95">trying to get people to look at the</text>
