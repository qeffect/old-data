  <text start="236.19" dur="6.72">are in the chapter on fasting and</text>
  <text start="238.91" dur="5.92">fasting is an interesting subject this</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.45">is either going to be one of your</text>
  <text start="244.83" dur="4.11">favorite subjects or it&amp;#39;ll be one of</text>
  <text start="246.36" dur="3.9">your least favorite subjects it&amp;#39;ll be 45</text>
  <text start="248.94" dur="5.85">minutes of your life you&amp;#39;ll never get</text>
  <text start="250.26" dur="5.849">back way it is some people are into</text>
  <text start="254.79" dur="5.04">fasting and some people aren&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="256.109" dur="7.321">that&amp;#39;s fine I was really never into</text>
  <text start="259.83" dur="6.209">fasting all that much until I became a</text>
  <text start="263.43" dur="3.959">Christian and until I got into the</text>
  <text start="266.039" dur="4.201">supernatural once</text>
  <text start="267.389" dur="5.55">God started giving me dreams and visions</text>
  <text start="270.24" dur="4.799">and I started hearing God&amp;#39;s voice the</text>
  <text start="272.939" dur="7.681">issue of fasting became a lot more</text>
  <text start="275.039" dur="6.451">important and and I&amp;#39;ll just kind of</text>
  <text start="280.62" dur="4.259">start out this way</text>
  <text start="281.49" dur="9.51">I have gone through periods of fasting</text>
  <text start="284.879" dur="8.641">in the past and if you are a person who</text>
  <text start="291" dur="4.319">is looking to connect with God to</text>
  <text start="293.52" dur="5.16">connect with the supernatural realm of</text>
  <text start="295.319" dur="4.171">heaven in a more regular meaningful</text>
  <text start="298.68" dur="5.389">intimate way</text>
  <text start="299.49" dur="8.459">I think fasting is a good way to do that</text>
  <text start="304.069" dur="5.53">that&amp;#39;s been my experience now in the Old</text>
  <text start="307.949" dur="6.12">Testament if you read about fasting in</text>
  <text start="309.599" dur="6.901">the Old Testament Moses fasted let&amp;#39;s see</text>
  <text start="314.069" dur="5.31">Elisha fasted they both fasted for forty</text>
  <text start="316.5" dur="4.919">days Moses fasted for forty days on the</text>
  <text start="319.379" dur="5.04">mountaintop when the glory of God was</text>
  <text start="321.419" dur="4.47">there and Elisha fasted for 40 days in</text>
  <text start="324.419" dur="3.601">the wilderness and that was actually a</text>
  <text start="325.889" dur="4.201">type of Jesus because Jesus fasted 40</text>
  <text start="328.02" dur="4.29">days in the wilderness right kind of a</text>
  <text start="330.09" dur="5.85">lot of the things that Elisha did Jesus</text>
  <text start="332.31" dur="5.579">did - Jesus fasted 40 days in the</text>
  <text start="335.94" dur="5.46">wilderness before he started his public</text>
  <text start="337.889" dur="6.631">ministry right he was tempted by Satan</text>
  <text start="341.4" dur="5.189">in the wilderness right three</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="5.13">temptations that were discussed I think</text>
  <text start="346.589" dur="7.17">in Luke chapter is it looked for I</text>
  <text start="349.65" dur="7.259">remember so their fasting is definitely</text>
  <text start="353.759" dur="5.731">prevalent in in the Bible in the Old</text>
  <text start="356.909" dur="5.97">Testament you&amp;#39;ll see recordings of</text>
  <text start="359.49" dur="5.359">people fasting in preparation for battle</text>
  <text start="362.879" dur="5.25">and they fasted when they needed</text>
  <text start="364.849" dur="4.6">direction from the Lord on something</text>
  <text start="368.129" dur="5.15">that was coming up you usually like</text>
  <text start="369.449" dur="6.361">battle plans sometimes people would fast</text>
  <text start="373.279" dur="3.85">when they were in Greek grieving for the</text>
  <text start="375.81" dur="3.029">death of someone who was close to them</text>
  <text start="377.129" dur="4.71">so there&amp;#39;s a number of different reasons</text>
  <text start="378.839" dur="5.67">why people fasted in the Bible New</text>
  <text start="381.839" dur="5.371">Testament the leaders of the church</text>
  <text start="384.509" dur="5.071">fasted before they sent out Paul and</text>
  <text start="387.21" dur="4.319">Barnabas and there are some other</text>
  <text start="389.58" dur="7.079">reasons why the New Testament leaders</text>
  <text start="391.529" dur="8.161">fasted for for for the purposes of this</text>
  <text start="396.659" dur="3.781">discussion because I&amp;#39;m primarily a</text>
  <text start="399.69" dur="5.58">person who&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="400.44" dur="8.76">stealing the conversation on fasting</text>
  <text start="405.27" dur="7.44">comes around to Matthew 17 where the</text>
  <text start="409.2" dur="7.47">disciples could not cast out an evil</text>
  <text start="412.71" dur="8.43">spirit from a boy who is having seizures</text>
  <text start="416.67" dur="7.77">basically and by the way if you need to</text>
  <text start="421.14" dur="6.39">get someone healed of seizures consider</text>
  <text start="424.44" dur="5.82">the possibility that they have a spirit</text>
  <text start="427.53" dur="6.33">that causes seizures that is pretty</text>
  <text start="430.26" dur="4.74">clear in Matthew 17 so Jesus told the</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="3.15">disciples when they came to him</text>
  <text start="435" dur="3.12">privately why could we not cast out the</text>
  <text start="437.01" dur="7.29">spirit and he said because of your</text>
  <text start="438.12" dur="9.15">unbelief and then depending on which</text>
  <text start="444.3" dur="5.67">translation you read and once some</text>
  <text start="447.27" dur="4.86">translations it adds for this kind does</text>
  <text start="449.97" dur="5.19">not come out by prayer and fasting right</text>
  <text start="452.13" dur="5.04">so some now there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="455.16" dur="4.35">disagreements about this and I am NOT</text>
  <text start="457.17" dur="4.41">going to spend too much time on the</text>
  <text start="459.51" dur="5.04">disagreements if you follow Currie</text>
  <text start="461.58" dur="5.28">Blake&amp;#39;s teaching on healing Corey Blake</text>
  <text start="464.55" dur="4.65">does not believe that the translation</text>
  <text start="466.86" dur="4.17">that talks about fasting is a valid</text>
  <text start="469.2" dur="3.98">translation he doesn&amp;#39;t believe fasting</text>
  <text start="471.03" dur="4.47">has anything to do with your ability to</text>
  <text start="473.18" dur="3.73">operate in the supernatural and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="475.5" dur="4.38">fine and I&amp;#39;m not going to argue about</text>
  <text start="476.91" dur="4.59">that whether you want to include the</text>
  <text start="479.88" dur="5.37">verse on fasting or not doesn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="7.05">matter it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s there right and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="485.25" dur="5.25">say this you do not need to fast in</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="5.43">order to operate in healing and</text>
  <text start="490.5" dur="9.27">deliverance you don&amp;#39;t need to Jesus gave</text>
  <text start="493.98" dur="10.86">His disciples us power and authority for</text>
  <text start="499.77" dur="7.41">healing and deliverance it the power the</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="5.55">power of the Holy Spirit is the power of</text>
  <text start="507.18" dur="4.59">God that dwells in us and when you need</text>
  <text start="510.39" dur="4.92">to work a creative miracle and you</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="5.85">release that power power works creative</text>
  <text start="515.31" dur="5.279">miracles when you need to cast out a</text>
  <text start="517.62" dur="5.76">demon when you need to command a fever</text>
  <text start="520.589" dur="5.551">to leave command infection to leave</text>
  <text start="523.38" dur="4.83">command tumors to leave your commanding</text>
  <text start="526.14" dur="5.01">you&amp;#39;re using Authority Jesus gave His</text>
  <text start="528.21" dur="6.51">disciples authority and he gave his</text>
  <text start="531.15" dur="8.429">power right that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all you need</text>
  <text start="534.72" dur="7.26">it to do healing and operating</text>
  <text start="539.579" dur="5.94">deliverance now fasting is an</text>
  <text start="541.98" dur="6.06">interesting thing because in my</text>
  <text start="545.519" dur="7.981">experience what fasting really does the</text>
  <text start="548.04" dur="7.5">advantage of it is it gives you a much</text>
  <text start="553.5" dur="5.72">better awareness of the supernatural</text>
  <text start="555.54" dur="7.53">realm of heaven and super and angels and</text>
  <text start="559.22" dur="7.96">evil spirits it look if you want to hear</text>
  <text start="563.07" dur="5.459">and see angels if you want to see demons</text>
  <text start="567.18" dur="3.659">a little bit more often if you want to</text>
  <text start="568.529" dur="5.55">be more aware of the supernatural realm</text>
  <text start="570.839" dur="5.881">the spiritual world spend some time</text>
  <text start="574.079" dur="5.611">fasting you&amp;#39;ll be interested to see what</text>
  <text start="576.72" dur="6.78">happens that that is my experience when</text>
  <text start="579.69" dur="7.53">I remember I fast and I have fasted as</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="6.99">long as nineteen days I become much more</text>
  <text start="587.22" dur="5.82">in tune to the supernatural world I hear</text>
  <text start="590.49" dur="5.37">the voice of God much more clearly I</text>
  <text start="593.04" dur="5.46">hear the voices of angels much more</text>
  <text start="595.86" dur="5.61">clearly I sometimes will see angels much</text>
  <text start="598.5" dur="5.73">more clearly when I&amp;#39;m fasting after you</text>
  <text start="601.47" dur="5.97">get past three or four days you know for</text>
  <text start="604.23" dur="5.4">me when I got into about fifteen sixteen</text>
  <text start="607.44" dur="4.019">days into it I was like totally in tune</text>
  <text start="609.63" dur="3.329">with the spiritual world like I was</text>
  <text start="611.459" dur="2.94">aware of what was going on in that</text>
  <text start="612.959" dur="2.611">natural world I knew that Denise was</text>
  <text start="614.399" dur="6.81">there and I could hear her talking new</text>
  <text start="615.57" dur="8.1">things but my my my spirit man was much</text>
  <text start="621.209" dur="4.201">more up front and center in my in my</text>
  <text start="623.67" dur="4.71">life and I was paying attention to as</text>
  <text start="625.41" dur="5.46">much more aware of what was going out of</text>
  <text start="628.38" dur="5.519">the spiritual world right and hearing</text>
  <text start="630.87" dur="7.469">God&amp;#39;s voice hearing angels sensing</text>
  <text start="633.899" dur="6.661">demons having if you&amp;#39;re not able to do</text>
  <text start="638.339" dur="4.921">that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not that you don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="640.56" dur="4.589">the gift or the ability it is an issue</text>
  <text start="643.26" dur="4.56">of focus it&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re focusing on</text>
  <text start="645.149" dur="5.611">most of us are trained our entire lives</text>
  <text start="647.82" dur="4.8">to focus on the natural world what is</text>
  <text start="650.76" dur="3.09">happening with our neighbors and our</text>
  <text start="652.62" dur="2.459">friends and relatives and what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="653.85" dur="3">happening when we go to school want to</text>
  <text start="655.079" dur="5.041">go to work we just focus on the natural</text>
  <text start="656.85" dur="5.82">world learning to hear God&amp;#39;s voice see</text>
  <text start="660.12" dur="5.04">angels hear angelic voices see demons</text>
  <text start="662.67" dur="4.32">recognize them all the spiritual world</text>
  <text start="665.16" dur="2.58">operating in the courts of heaven all of</text>
  <text start="666.99" dur="4.08">that</text>
  <text start="667.74" dur="5.97">is an issue of training your mind to</text>
  <text start="671.07" dur="5.1">become more aware of and focus on the</text>
  <text start="673.71" dur="4.86">supernatural world that is existing it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="676.17" dur="6.59">there all the time you have to simply</text>
  <text start="678.57" dur="7.95">for a lot of us we have to learn to</text>
  <text start="682.76" dur="7.12">sense and and perceive what our spirit</text>
  <text start="686.52" dur="5.61">man is seeing and hearing and focus on</text>
  <text start="689.88" dur="5.28">that and not focus on the natural world</text>
  <text start="692.13" dur="5.52">that&amp;#39;s really what it comes down to when</text>
  <text start="695.16" dur="4.29">when you&amp;#39;re looking to increase your</text>
  <text start="697.65" dur="4.77">sensitivity to the spiritual world it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="699.45" dur="5.13">really a matter of focus and fasting</text>
  <text start="702.42" dur="4.59">helps you do that that&amp;#39;s that has been</text>
  <text start="704.58" dur="3.66">my experience if you are not getting</text>
  <text start="707.01" dur="2.43">words of knowledge when you&amp;#39;re praying</text>
  <text start="708.24" dur="2.73">for people to be healed if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="709.44" dur="3.75">really hearing all the spirit well if</text>
  <text start="710.97" dur="3.96">you&amp;#39;re not like when I was fasting this</text>
  <text start="713.19" dur="4.56">is crazy</text>

  <text start="1031.069" dur="5.551">thing about fasting is really it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1032.959" dur="4.62">learning obedience to God it is learning</text>
  <text start="1036.62" dur="3.829">to hear his voice</text>
  <text start="1037.579" dur="4.59">learning to sense his presence and</text>
