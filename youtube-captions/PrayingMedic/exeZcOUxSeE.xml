  <text start="79.95" dur="7.68">mentioned first group this is first</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="5.911">Corinthians 12 verses 7 through 10 but</text>
  <text start="87.63" dur="5.61">the manifestation of the Spirit the</text>
  <text start="90.78" dur="4.71">Spirit of God is given to each one for</text>
  <text start="93.24" dur="3.96">the profit of all four to one is given</text>

  <text start="99.24" dur="6.059">knowledge through the same spirit to</text>

  <text start="105.299" dur="4.441">another gifts of healings by the same</text>
  <text start="107.549" dur="4.201">spirit to another the working of</text>
  <text start="109.74" dur="4.769">miracles to another prophecy to another</text>
  <text start="111.75" dur="4.53">discerning of spirits to another</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="4.201">different kinds of tongues to another</text>
  <text start="116.28" dur="4.74">interpretations of tongues so the</text>
  <text start="118.71" dur="4.949">Apostle Paul is describing all the</text>
  <text start="121.02" dur="5.669">different gifts to the Spirit these</text>
  <text start="123.659" dur="5.52">gifts are manifestations of the Holy</text>
  <text start="126.689" dur="4.831">Spirit the Spirit of God it is the way</text>
  <text start="129.179" dur="3.261">in which the character and the nature of</text>
  <text start="131.52" dur="4.19">God is</text>
  <text start="132.44" dur="5.76">manifest in US and through us that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="135.71" dur="6.48">I see the gifts of the Spirit it&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="138.2" dur="6.75">God operates or manifests his character</text>
  <text start="142.19" dur="5.67">through us for the purpose of</text>
  <text start="144.95" dur="4.92">deliverance healing leading people to</text>
  <text start="147.86" dur="4.26">Jesus for a lot of different things the</text>
  <text start="149.87" dur="6.99">gifts to the spirit have many different</text>
  <text start="152.12" dur="6.9">purposes but remember Paul said that the</text>
  <text start="156.86" dur="5.52">gifts are for the edification of the</text>
  <text start="159.02" dur="5.58">body the body of Christ so when you</text>
  <text start="162.38" dur="7.98">think of the gifts of the Spirit you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="164.6" dur="8.7">primarily thinking about things how this</text>
  <text start="170.36" dur="4.17">operates among the believers and for the</text>
  <text start="173.3" dur="3.69">benefit of believers</text>
  <text start="174.53" dur="3.41">although things like weird acknowledging</text>
  <text start="176.99" dur="6.21">the word of wisdom</text>
  <text start="177.94" dur="7.02">sometimes operate in us to bring people</text>
  <text start="183.2" dur="4.17">to God who don&amp;#39;t know about him and</text>
  <text start="184.96" dur="6.13">we&amp;#39;ll cover that in just a few minutes</text>
  <text start="187.37" dur="9.9">all right so so what exactly is a</text>
  <text start="191.09" dur="10.5">rhinology well at bottom a word of</text>
  <text start="197.27" dur="7.62">knowledge is information it is facts</text>
  <text start="201.59" dur="6.21">that are true about a situation or about</text>
  <text start="204.89" dur="7.65">a person it&amp;#39;s information in fact that</text>
  <text start="207.8" dur="7.68">we don&amp;#39;t have access to in our natural</text>
  <text start="212.54" dur="5.61">ability to know things it is knowledge</text>
  <text start="215.48" dur="6.71">and of facts that are beyond our ability</text>
  <text start="218.15" dur="8.369">to know without supernatural revelation</text>
  <text start="222.19" dur="7.15">so what do I mean by that well I mean if</text>
  <text start="226.519" dur="6.121">God is if you were talking to somebody</text>
  <text start="229.34" dur="6.149">in a waiting room at a hospital there</text>
  <text start="232.64" dur="6.45">would be no way that you would know that</text>
  <text start="235.489" dur="5.041">person had you know migraine headaches</text>
  <text start="239.09" dur="4.41">or something if you&amp;#39;re just talking to</text>
  <text start="240.53" dur="4.77">them unless God reveal that to you it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="243.5" dur="4.769">supernatural knowledge it&amp;#39;s knowledge</text>
  <text start="245.3" dur="5.01">you wouldn&amp;#39;t normally have so in the</text>
  <text start="248.269" dur="4.321">same way that now it&amp;#39;s a word of</text>
  <text start="250.31" dur="5.94">knowledge in the same way that a word is</text>
  <text start="252.59" dur="6.019">a fragment of a sentence a word of</text>
  <text start="256.25" dur="5.4">knowledge is a little bit of information</text>
  <text start="258.609" dur="4.801">that God has about that person&amp;#39;s entire</text>
  <text start="261.65" dur="4.02">situation</text>
  <text start="263.41" dur="4.33">so God doesn&amp;#39;t tell us</text>
  <text start="265.67" dur="4.77">all of the information about that</text>
  <text start="267.74" dur="10.16">person&amp;#39;s life or that situation he tells</text>
  <text start="270.44" dur="8.67">us a little bit words of knowledge are</text>
  <text start="277.9" dur="2.95">okay</text>
  <text start="279.11" dur="3.63">a word of knowledge is similar to a word</text>
  <text start="280.85" dur="4.82">of wisdom but I&amp;#39;m going to make a</text>
  <text start="282.74" dur="7.17">distinction here because it might help</text>
  <text start="285.67" dur="7.59">knowledge is information wisdom is</text>
  <text start="289.91" dur="5.85">knowing what to do with information I</text>
  <text start="293.26" dur="6.01">know a lot of people who have a lot of</text>
  <text start="295.76" dur="7.07">knowledge they have book smarts they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.27" dur="7.17">intelligent but they don&amp;#39;t have wisdom</text>
  <text start="302.83" dur="6.13">because they don&amp;#39;t know how to apply the</text>
  <text start="306.44" dur="4.83">information the knowledge that they have</text>
  <text start="308.96" dur="6.63">in their own personal life they make bad</text>
  <text start="311.27" dur="6.3">choices bad decisions they lack wisdom</text>
  <text start="315.59" dur="3.63">they have plenty of information they</text>
  <text start="317.57" dur="4.8">have plenty of knowledge they don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="319.22" dur="7.44">wisdom so a word of knowledge is</text>
  <text start="322.37" dur="6.54">information from God a word of wisdom</text>
  <text start="326.66" dur="4.65">tells you what to do with the</text>
  <text start="328.91" dur="6.69">information you have let&amp;#39;s say a word of</text>
  <text start="331.31" dur="8.37">knowledge might be for example that that</text>
  <text start="335.6" dur="6.84">person has a loss of hearing that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="339.68" dur="6.06">fact that&amp;#39;s information God might tell</text>
  <text start="342.44" dur="5.97">you vision and a thought that person is</text>
  <text start="345.74" dur="4.59">not able to hear they have deafness now</text>
  <text start="348.41" dur="4.53">that&amp;#39;s information but what do you do</text>
  <text start="350.33" dur="5.04">with it if the Lord told you they have a</text>
  <text start="352.94" dur="4.77">demonic device attached to their head</text>
  <text start="355.37" dur="4.62">and you see in a vision you see yourself</text>
  <text start="357.71" dur="4.68">removing that demonic device from that</text>
  <text start="359.99" dur="4.92">person&amp;#39;s head that is a word of wisdom</text>
  <text start="362.39" dur="6.51">it&amp;#39;s telling you what to do with the</text>
  <text start="364.91" dur="4.92">information you have so that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="368.9" dur="3.24">difference between a word of knowledge</text>
  <text start="369.83" dur="10.59">and a word of wisdom what a wisdom tells</text>
  <text start="372.14" dur="11.01">you what to do so the words of knowledge</text>
  <text start="380.42" dur="7.55">and words of wisdom can come in many</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="8.97">different ways I most often receive them</text>
  <text start="387.97" dur="6.34">through things that I see in my mind God</text>
  <text start="392.12" dur="5.25">communicates to us in many different</text>
  <text start="394.31" dur="4.27">ways he communicates to us through</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="6.549">thoughts</text>
  <text start="398.58" dur="8.609">that appear in her mind to be so many</text>
  <text start="403.919" dur="5.31">people hear the voice of God as the</text>
  <text start="407.189" dur="5.91">still small voice that voice that speaks</text>
  <text start="409.229" dur="6.9">inside of you I describe it more as I</text>
  <text start="413.099" dur="6.361">get these thought impressions that I</text>
  <text start="416.129" dur="6.421">know are not mine they&amp;#39;re from a source</text>
  <text start="419.46" dur="5.009">outside of me the thoughts of God are</text>
  <text start="422.55" dur="4.56">different from my thoughts but he</text>
  <text start="424.469" dur="5.121">communicates it to us through</text>
  <text start="427.11" dur="6.75">impressions that we receive in our mind</text>
  <text start="429.59" dur="7.09">okay that&amp;#39;s one way so one of the ways</text>
  <text start="433.86" dur="4.559">that God communicates to us is through</text>
  <text start="436.68" dur="3.539">thought impressions like that still</text>
  <text start="438.419" dur="3.511">small voice that we get these</text>
  <text start="440.219" dur="3.35">impressions and thoughts and to kind of</text>
  <text start="441.93" dur="5.4">know that they&amp;#39;re not ours</text>
  <text start="443.569" dur="10.541">another way is visual imagery that we</text>
  <text start="447.33" dur="9.899">see in our mind now up until 2008 I had</text>
  <text start="454.11" dur="4.859">never seen a vision I just when I closed</text>
  <text start="457.229" dur="5.671">my eyes I didn&amp;#39;t see anything I just saw</text>
  <text start="458.969" dur="7.771">blackness but I went through a period of</text>
  <text start="462.9" dur="7.44">time where God was training me and I</text>
  <text start="466.74" dur="6.769">learned how to see spiritual revelation</text>
  <text start="470.34" dur="5.4">in the form of visions and all it is is</text>
  <text start="473.509" dur="3.97">impressions of things you see in your</text>
  <text start="475.74" dur="3.989">mind it&amp;#39;s like you have that little TV</text>
  <text start="477.479" dur="5.791">screen in your mind and that is where</text>
  <text start="479.729" dur="5.701">you see visions a lot of people try to</text>
  <text start="483.27" dur="4.859">make seeing visions real spooky and kind</text>
  <text start="485.43" dur="4.949">of mystical most of the visions that</text>
  <text start="488.129" dur="3.69">that God gives us are not that spooky</text>
  <text start="490.379" dur="4.07">and not that mystical they&amp;#39;re actually</text>
  <text start="491.819" dur="5.34">kind of kind of mundane and boring</text>
  <text start="494.449" dur="4.87">except that when you start to realize oh</text>
  <text start="497.159" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s God showing me stuff then you</text>
  <text start="499.319" dur="5.94">think well maybe it&amp;#39;s not someone didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="500.759" dur="5.851">important but they&amp;#39;re not visions that</text>
  <text start="505.259" dur="5.46">God gives us when he&amp;#39;s giving us</text>
  <text start="506.61" dur="6.57">revelation are not all that weird and</text>
  <text start="510.719" dur="4.831">spooky they don&amp;#39;t have to be they can be</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="3.33">some of them are I have seen some things</text>
  <text start="515.55" dur="3.63">that are pretty freaky</text>
  <text start="516.51" dur="4.769">I&amp;#39;ve had some visuals and revelatory</text>
  <text start="519.18" dur="5.48">experiences where I saw things in the</text>
  <text start="521.279" dur="5.401">spirit that were a little bit spooky but</text>
  <text start="524.66" dur="7.63">generally speaking they&amp;#39;re not all that</text>
  <text start="526.68" dur="8.13">weird you have been seeing visions look</text>
  <text start="532.29" dur="5.97">and for those of you who are interested</text>
  <text start="534.81" dur="6.53">I did write another book called seeing</text>
  <text start="538.26" dur="6.78">in the spirit made simple in this book I</text>
  <text start="541.34" dur="6.07">walk people through the simple process</text>
  <text start="545.04" dur="5.61">of understanding how God speaks to us</text>
  <text start="547.41" dur="5.07">through visual revelation how do you</text>
  <text start="550.65" dur="4.53">know when something that you see in your</text>
  <text start="552.48" dur="6.48">mind is from you or if it&amp;#39;s from God or</text>
  <text start="555.18" dur="6.24">if it&amp;#39;s from a demon that book is pretty</text>
  <text start="558.96" dur="6.75">good information for people who want to</text>
  <text start="561.42" dur="6.39">learn more about seeing visions and as</text>
  <text start="565.71" dur="4.31">long as I&amp;#39;m at it I might as well tell</text>
  <text start="567.81" dur="5.58">you about this one hearing God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="570.02" dur="5.41">so I&amp;#39;ve talked a little bit about how</text>
  <text start="573.39" dur="3.54">God speaks to us through the still small</text>
  <text start="575.43" dur="4.32">voice through impressions that we</text>
  <text start="576.93" dur="4.86">receive in our mind through and God</text>
  <text start="579.75" dur="3.75">speaks to us in so many ways he speaks</text>
  <text start="581.79" dur="4.05">to us through the circumstances of her</text>
  <text start="583.5" dur="6.24">life through music through art through</text>
  <text start="585.84" dur="5.91">the whether that book covers all the</text>
  <text start="589.74" dur="4.95">different ways in which God speaks to us</text>
  <text start="591.75" dur="5.1">God is always speaking to us if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="594.69" dur="4.08">not hearing god it&amp;#39;s not because he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="596.85" dur="5.25">not speaking to you it&amp;#39;s because you</text>
  <text start="598.77" dur="5.52">haven&amp;#39;t really tuned in to the</text>
  <text start="602.1" dur="4.17">frequencies and the modes of</text>
  <text start="604.29" dur="4.35">communication that he&amp;#39;s using and you</text>
  <text start="606.27" dur="5.01">can learn how to do that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="608.64" dur="4.17">difficult it&amp;#39;s not the it&amp;#39;s not like</text>
  <text start="611.28" dur="3.54">some people are gifted and other people</text>
  <text start="612.81" dur="5.1">don&amp;#39;t have the gift everyone can learn</text>
  <text start="614.82" dur="5.54">how to hear God we can all hear God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="617.91" dur="4.62">voice we can all receive revelation</text>
  <text start="620.36" dur="8.71">sometimes God speaks through silence</text>
  <text start="622.53" dur="9.63">that is true but he is he is kind of a</text>
  <text start="629.07" dur="5.58">blabber mouth to me I get thought</text>
  <text start="632.16" dur="4.38">impressions and leading and revelations</text>
  <text start="634.65" dur="6.72">from God pretty continuously throughout</text>
  <text start="636.54" dur="8.25">my day and God can also give words of</text>
  <text start="641.37" dur="6.78">knowledge and words of wisdom through</text>
  <text start="644.79" dur="6.51">dreams I&amp;#39;ve had many words of knowledge</text>
  <text start="648.15" dur="5.37">through dreams and he can also give</text>
  <text start="651.3" dur="4.11">words of knowledge through pain that we</text>
  <text start="653.52" dur="5.819">feel in our body believe it or not if</text>
  <text start="655.41" dur="6.21">you don&amp;#39;t know this examples from the</text>
  <text start="659.339" dur="5.461">scripture of words of knowledge when</text>
  <text start="661.62" dur="3.79">Jesus told two of his disciples go into</text>
  <text start="664.8" dur="2.95">town</text>
  <text start="665.41" dur="3.719">and you&amp;#39;ll find a donkey that no one has</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="3.8">ever ridden</text>
  <text start="669.129" dur="5.94">go get that donkey and bring it here</text>
  <text start="671.55" dur="5.2">Jesus had a word of knowledge he knew or</text>
  <text start="675.069" dur="3.56">the donkey was he knew no one had ever</text>
  <text start="676.75" dur="4.92">ridden that donkey he knew where it was</text>
  <text start="678.629" dur="4.921">the Holy Spirit told him about the</text>
  <text start="681.67" dur="5.88">donkey that&amp;#39;s a word of knowledge okay</text>
  <text start="683.55" dur="8.139">when Jesus met the woman at the well of</text>
  <text start="687.55" dur="7.529">Samaria he said to her woman go get your</text>
  <text start="691.689" dur="6.15">husband and she said I don&amp;#39;t have a</text>

  <text start="701.709" dur="4.44">living with now is not your husband</text>
  <text start="703.24" dur="5.01">that&amp;#39;s a word of knowledge that is</text>
  <text start="706.149" dur="3.841">factual information that you just</text>
  <text start="708.25" dur="3.029">wouldn&amp;#39;t have known about if the host</text>
  <text start="709.99" dur="3.63">Burt have not given it to him</text>
  <text start="711.279" dur="4.821">so Jesus operated in the word of</text>
  <text start="713.62" dur="5.69">knowledge quite often in the scriptures</text>
  <text start="716.1" dur="7.57">in the book of Acts the Apostle Peter</text>
  <text start="719.31" dur="6.279">was given revelation from God so Peter</text>
  <text start="723.67" dur="3.599">was told that the gospel is for the</text>
  <text start="725.589" dur="3.42">Gentiles as well the Jews well how did</text>
  <text start="727.269" dur="6.031">he know that God showed him in a vision</text>
  <text start="729.009" dur="8.07">and then after Peter got done arguing</text>
  <text start="733.3" dur="6.779">with God about the fact that Gentiles</text>
  <text start="737.079" dur="5.31">could receive the gospel God told them</text>
  <text start="740.079" dur="4.051">hey Peter there are three men on their</text>
  <text start="742.389" dur="3.901">way to your house right now go</text>
  <text start="744.13" dur="3.78">downstairs knock they&amp;#39;re gonna knock</text>
  <text start="746.29" dur="3.96">open the door and don&amp;#39;t question</text>
  <text start="747.91" dur="6.81">anything they tell you just believe what</text>
  <text start="750.25" dur="5.97">they tell you so that was word of</text>
  <text start="754.72" dur="5.15">knowledge word of wisdom God was</text>
  <text start="756.22" dur="3.65">communicating with Peter about his plan</text>
  <text start="760.92" dur="7.839">so word of knowledge is information but</text>
  <text start="766.87" dur="4.589">it doesn&amp;#39;t accomplish the will of God</text>
  <text start="768.759" dur="5.611">unless we do something about it if Peter</text>
  <text start="771.459" dur="5.341">had not gone down and opened the door to</text>
  <text start="774.37" dur="5.88">those three Gentiles who are coming if</text>
  <text start="776.8" dur="6.06">you would have not met them Cornelius</text>
  <text start="780.25" dur="5.97">the gospel would never have gone to the</text>
  <text start="782.86" dur="5.159">Gentiles Peter heads obey and when you</text>
  <text start="786.22" dur="4.65">receive a word of knowledge you have to</text>
  <text start="788.019" dur="5.79">obey God is telling you hey that person</text>
  <text start="790.87" dur="5.49">has a problem and I want to fix it then</text>
  <text start="793.809" dur="5.551">you have to exercise authority release</text>
  <text start="796.36" dur="4.62">power kick out the demons you need to do</text>
  <text start="799.36" dur="3.87">thing that is going to change that</text>
  <text start="800.98" dur="6.44">situation okay</text>
  <text start="803.23" dur="4.19">so that&amp;#39;s how the word knowledge works</text>
  <text start="807.6" dur="9.25">although I will say this I have been to</text>
  <text start="812.88" dur="6.37">healing meetings where there&amp;#39;s a crowd</text>
  <text start="816.85" dur="4.56">of people and someone upon the platform</text>
  <text start="819.25" dur="3.99">has a microphone and they will call out</text>
  <text start="821.41" dur="5.28">words of knowledge and they&amp;#39;ll tell a</text>
  <text start="823.24" dur="5.88">person if you have this condition stand</text>
  <text start="826.69" dur="4.62">up and the people will stand up and</text>
  <text start="829.12" dur="5.909">they&amp;#39;ll be healed without anyone praying</text>
  <text start="831.31" dur="6.68">for them sometimes just an act of faith</text>
  <text start="835.029" dur="7.831">of standing up raising your hand will</text>
  <text start="837.99" dur="7.24">appropriate your healing sometimes but</text>
  <text start="842.86" dur="3.84">not always my experience has been more</text>
  <text start="845.23" dur="3.39">often when God gives me a word of</text>
  <text start="846.7" dur="4.62">knowledge I have to go and do something</text>
  <text start="848.62" dur="4.529">I have to pray for that person release</text>
  <text start="851.32" dur="3.389">power exercise authority something like</text>
  <text start="853.149" dur="7.38">that I&amp;#39;ll give you a couple of examples</text>
  <text start="854.709" dur="8.671">of that here in just a minute so one</text>
  <text start="860.529" dur="5.821">time I had a dream I woke up in the</text>
  <text start="863.38" dur="7.199">morning had a dream about healing birth</text>
  <text start="866.35" dur="7.44">defects and the next day when I went to</text>
  <text start="870.579" dur="5.87">work the first patient I transported was</text>
  <text start="873.79" dur="7.53">a young girl who had Down syndrome and</text>
  <text start="876.449" dur="7.871">her parents were believers and I would</text>
  <text start="881.32" dur="5.759">not normally have had much faith to heal</text>
  <text start="884.32" dur="4.41">down syndrome because I don&amp;#39;t know of</text>
  <text start="887.079" dur="4.531">any testimonies of Down syndrome ever</text>
  <text start="888.73" dur="5.91">being healed that I know of I&amp;#39;m sure it</text>
  <text start="891.61" dur="5.55">has been but I haven&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot</text>
  <text start="894.64" dur="4.319">of read a lot of testimonies listen to a</text>
  <text start="897.16" dur="3.72">lot of testimonies I don&amp;#39;t know of any</text>
  <text start="898.959" dur="5.281">that I can think of of dancing or being</text>
  <text start="900.88" dur="6.35">healed so I pray for this girl in the</text>
  <text start="904.24" dur="6.81">ambulance with her parents with faith</text>
  <text start="907.23" dur="5.77">because God gave me the dream about</text>
  <text start="911.05" dur="5.31">healing birth defects before I went on</text>
  <text start="913" dur="6.449">the call that was a word of knowledge</text>
  <text start="916.36" dur="5.43">and and it was almost like it gave me</text>
  <text start="919.449" dur="5.431">the gift of faith so the gift of faith</text>
  <text start="921.79" dur="6.87">is supernatural faith that you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="924.88" dur="6.149">have God gives you this confidence this</text>
  <text start="928.66" dur="3.37">faith to pray for a situation you</text>
  <text start="931.029" dur="3.161">normally would not have</text>
  <text start="932.03" dur="3.57">much faithful and I think along with the</text>
  <text start="934.19" dur="3.42">word of knowledge I probably received a</text>
  <text start="935.6" dur="3.3">gift of faith to pray for that girl to</text>
  <text start="937.61" dur="3.24">the healed now I dropped her off at the</text>
  <text start="938.9" dur="3.15">hospital with her parents I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="940.85" dur="3.45">if she was healed I was not able to</text>
  <text start="942.05" dur="8.43">follow up with her but that&amp;#39;s an example</text>
  <text start="944.3" dur="9.2">of word of knowledge another one that I</text>
  <text start="950.48" dur="6.03">had I was at an airport one time and</text>
  <text start="953.5" dur="5.56">Denise and I were standing in line and I</text>
  <text start="956.51" dur="5.46">went to a at a coffee shop</text>
  <text start="959.06" dur="4.95">we had a long wait for flight went to</text>
  <text start="961.97" dur="4.77">get some coffee and I&amp;#39;m standing there</text>
  <text start="964.01" dur="7.67">line and as I often do and I&amp;#39;m in line I</text>
  <text start="966.74" dur="8.91">close my eyes and in my mind I saw an</text>
  <text start="971.68" dur="6.73">image of a woman with long kind of</text>
  <text start="975.65" dur="7.23">brownish blond hair and I saw the word</text>
  <text start="978.41" dur="6.81">migraines so I started looking around</text>
  <text start="982.88" dur="4.53">for her I&amp;#39;m at an airport right there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="985.22" dur="5.73">people all over the place and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="987.41" dur="5.61">see her anywhere but I thought okay well</text>
  <text start="990.95" dur="4.05">maybe the image that I saw was not</text>
  <text start="993.02" dur="3.99">exactly like her so I started just</text>
  <text start="995" dur="4.83">asking random women hey do you have</text>
  <text start="997.01" dur="4.38">migraine headaches no well what about</text>
  <text start="999.83" dur="3.03">you do you have migraine headaches no I</text>
  <text start="1001.39" dur="2.94">asked like five people and nobody had</text>
  <text start="1002.86" dur="4.05">migraines and I thought okay that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1004.33" dur="4.11">really weird I know I received a word of</text>
  <text start="1006.91" dur="6.12">knowledge but nobody around me had</text>
  <text start="1008.44" dur="7.38">migraine headaches so Denise and I go</text>
  <text start="1013.03" dur="6.21">and sit down and we get on our flight</text>
  <text start="1015.82" dur="4.74">and we&amp;#39;re in the air we&amp;#39;ve been in the</text>
  <text start="1019.24" dur="3.9">air now for about an hour and a half and</text>
  <text start="1020.56" dur="4.71">I&amp;#39;m reading the book power healing by</text>
  <text start="1023.14" dur="4.86">John Wimber because I&amp;#39;m just learning</text>
  <text start="1025.27" dur="5.82">about healing and this is probably gosh</text>
  <text start="1028" dur="4.65">seven years ago so I&amp;#39;m reading this book</text>
  <text start="1031.09" dur="5.46">power healing by John Wimber</text>
  <text start="1032.65" dur="6.63">and I look up from reading the book and</text>
  <text start="1036.55" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;ve seen a woman standing in line to go</text>
  <text start="1039.28" dur="4.89">to the bathroom and it&amp;#39;s the woman that</text>
  <text start="1041.86" dur="5.96">I had seen in the vision when I was back</text>
  <text start="1044.17" dur="9.48">at the coffee shop it&amp;#39;s exact same woman</text>
  <text start="1047.82" dur="7.84">so like wow that&amp;#39;s really interesting so</text>
  <text start="1053.65" dur="4.44">I get up out of my seat and I go over to</text>
  <text start="1055.66" dur="5.16">her and I say hey do you happen to have</text>
  <text start="1058.09" dur="6.469">migraine headaches and she is like her</text>
  <text start="1060.82" dur="5.9">mouth just dropped open she&amp;#39;s like what</text>
  <text start="1064.559" dur="5.37">how did you know I had migraine headache</text>
  <text start="1066.72" dur="5.069">and I said well God showed me that you</text>
  <text start="1069.929" dur="3.99">have migraines and he wants me to pray</text>
  <text start="1071.789" dur="4.71">for you so she said okay I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="1073.919" dur="5.01">the bathroom meet me at my seat when I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1076.499" dur="5.071">done and you can pray for me so she went</text>
  <text start="1078.929" dur="4.141">and she sat down I went and met her at</text>
  <text start="1081.57" dur="3.479">her seat fortunately she was sitting</text>
  <text start="1083.07" dur="4.349">right on the row on the wing where</text>
  <text start="1085.049" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s a little bit of extra space so I</text>
  <text start="1087.419" dur="5.34">got to pray for her and her headaches</text>
  <text start="1089.549" dur="5.61">were gone after we were done and I got</text>
  <text start="1092.759" dur="7.441">to pray for her husband he had some form</text>
  <text start="1095.159" dur="7.171">of cancer so that is how God speaks to</text>
  <text start="1100.2" dur="4.729">us he gives us revelation he gives to</text>
  <text start="1102.33" dur="6.99">information he wants people healed and</text>
  <text start="1104.929" dur="5.95">and and God will you know he wants he</text>
  <text start="1109.32" dur="3.12">has so much love so much compassion</text>
  <text start="1110.879" dur="6.601">Thank You William</text>
  <text start="1112.44" dur="7.559">God is so full of compassion he wants us</text>
  <text start="1117.48" dur="5.279">to reach out and get people healed</text>
  <text start="1119.999" dur="4.41">that&amp;#39;s what he wants us to do he&amp;#39;s given</text>
  <text start="1122.759" dur="4.201">us authority he&amp;#39;s given us his power</text>
  <text start="1124.409" dur="5.64">he&amp;#39;s given us the ability to kick out</text>
  <text start="1126.96" dur="5.309">demons and get rid of pain and all we</text>
  <text start="1130.049" dur="5.7">need to do is focus on what he is</text>
  <text start="1132.269" dur="5.971">showing us about other people and he</text>
  <text start="1135.749" dur="5.01">will teach us and he will get those</text>
  <text start="1138.24" dur="10.259">people healed through us we just have to</text>
  <text start="1140.759" dur="9.601">be obedient so another thing to consider</text>
  <text start="1148.499" dur="6.38">about words and knowledge God will</text>
  <text start="1150.36" dur="7.439">sometimes highlight a person in a crowd</text>
  <text start="1154.879" dur="4.451">sometimes I know people who say that a</text>
  <text start="1157.799" dur="3.661">person will appear almost if they&amp;#39;re in</text>
  <text start="1159.33" dur="6.059">a spotlight like the rest of the crowd</text>
  <text start="1161.46" dur="5.28">will become in a dim light and this one</text>
  <text start="1165.389" dur="3">person will be highlighted in the</text>
  <text start="1166.74" dur="4.289">spotlight and they&amp;#39;ll just stand out</text>
  <text start="1168.389" dur="4.591">from the rest of the crowd and if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1171.029" dur="3.331">paying attention and you see that God</text>
  <text start="1172.98" dur="3.72">will sometimes give you information</text>
  <text start="1174.36" dur="4.049">about that person medical conditions</text>
  <text start="1176.7" dur="4.89">that they have financial situations that</text>
  <text start="1178.409" dur="5.73">he wants to address there are many</text>
  <text start="1181.59" dur="5.25">different ways in which God can reveal</text>
  <text start="1184.139" dur="4.23">to us things that he wants to address in</text>
  <text start="1186.84" dur="3.569">that person&amp;#39;s life sometimes it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1188.369" dur="6.271">emotional healing you never really know</text>
  <text start="1190.409" dur="10.171">so you need to be open and learn</text>
  <text start="1194.64" dur="9.51">to receive revelation from God words of</text>
  <text start="1200.58" dur="5.19">knowledge often present as a pain in</text>
  <text start="1204.15" dur="4.53">your body that you don&amp;#39;t normally have</text>
  <text start="1205.77" dur="7.56">and the people that I know who operate</text>
  <text start="1208.68" dur="7.05">in healing and miracles many times they</text>
  <text start="1213.33" dur="4.35">will be at a prayer meeting or church</text>
  <text start="1215.73" dur="5.01">and they&amp;#39;ll have pain in their shoulder</text>
  <text start="1217.68" dur="4.92">and in their neck and in their back pain</text>
  <text start="1220.74" dur="2.97">someplace and they know it&amp;#39;s a word of</text>

  <text start="1347.679" dur="2.97">goes how long have you had it</text>
  <text start="1348.97" dur="3.03">and I said about 10 minutes he goes</text>
  <text start="1350.649" dur="4.441">that&amp;#39;s crazy</text>
  <text start="1352" dur="6.45">he said I&amp;#39;ve had pain right there in my</text>
  <text start="1355.09" dur="5.549">hand all week and what happened was he</text>
  <text start="1358.45" dur="3.839">was in a tree in his backyard trimming</text>
  <text start="1360.639" dur="4.62">some branches and he was hanging on to a</text>
  <text start="1362.289" dur="7.051">branch and it broke and this broken limb</text>
  <text start="1365.259" dur="6.12">went into his hand and made soft tissue</text>
  <text start="1369.34" dur="4.439">injury and he had a soft tissue injury</text>
  <text start="1371.379" dur="4.111">right through the middle of his hand and</text>
  <text start="1373.779" dur="4.02">he would behave been in excruciating</text>
  <text start="1375.49" dur="8.399">pain all week and never told me about it</text>
  <text start="1377.799" dur="8.73">so I put my hand on his hand released</text>
  <text start="1383.889" dur="5.01">power commanded the soft tissue to be</text>
  <text start="1386.529" dur="7.23">healed and boom like that all of his</text>
  <text start="1388.899" dur="6.961">pain was gone so God can give you a word</text>
  <text start="1393.759" dur="3.63">of knowledge as pain in your body that</text>
  <text start="1395.86" dur="4.559">you don&amp;#39;t normally have and if you don&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1404.11" dur="11.01">healed so the next time you have pain</text>

  <text start="1418.629" dur="6.18">you&amp;#39;ll be surprised you&amp;#39;ll be surprised</text>
  <text start="1422.259" dur="4.17">at how often pain in your body will is</text>
  <text start="1424.809" dur="4.171">actually a manifestation that&amp;#39;s a word</text>
  <text start="1426.429" dur="5.22">knowledge for somebody else once you</text>
  <text start="1428.98" dur="5.97">start flowing in that and learning how</text>
  <text start="1431.649" dur="6.99">God is speaking to you you might be</text>
  <text start="1434.95" dur="5.04">shocked at how often God is trying to do</text>
  <text start="1438.639" dur="10.561">things through you that you&amp;#39;re not aware</text>
  <text start="1439.99" dur="10.95">of all right let me give you let me give</text>
  <text start="1449.2" dur="6.449">you one of the more unusual words of</text>
  <text start="1450.94" dur="8.489">knowledge that I had probably six years</text>
  <text start="1455.649" dur="5.611">ago seven years ago I was changing the</text>
  <text start="1459.429" dur="5.34">timing belt on my Subaru</text>
  <text start="1461.26" dur="6.48">and I had taken everything off the front</text>
  <text start="1464.769" dur="4.921">end I took the old-time belt off and put</text>
  <text start="1467.74" dur="4.86">the new one on lined up all the timing</text>
  <text start="1469.69" dur="4.88">marks put the cover back on and tried to</text>
  <text start="1472.6" dur="5.37">start the engine and it wouldn&amp;#39;t start</text>
  <text start="1474.57" dur="5.229">and I was using the service manual and I</text>
  <text start="1477.97" dur="6.419">was looking make sure I had everything</text>
  <text start="1479.799" dur="6.6">the way it was supposed to be and it</text>
  <text start="1484.389" dur="4.53">wouldn&amp;#39;t start and I was very frustrated</text>
  <text start="1486.399" dur="4.74">so I took the timing belt cover off I</text>
  <text start="1488.919" dur="4.441">looked again at the timing marks checked</text>
  <text start="1491.139" dur="6.121">everything did this two or three times</text>
  <text start="1493.36" dur="8.039">the car wouldn&amp;#39;t start I was so</text>
  <text start="1497.26" dur="6.169">frustrated so rather than get frustrated</text>
  <text start="1501.399" dur="6.27">I closed my eyes</text>
  <text start="1503.429" dur="8.71">guess what God showed me closed my eyes</text>
  <text start="1507.669" dur="7.23">and in my mind in a vision I see the</text>
  <text start="1512.139" dur="5.101">timing belt the camshaft the crankshaft</text>
  <text start="1514.899" dur="6.78">I see the gears and I see the timing</text>
  <text start="1517.24" dur="6.63">marks on the gears and I highlighted was</text>
  <text start="1521.679" dur="3.951">a mark I didn&amp;#39;t know about there were</text>
  <text start="1523.87" dur="3.899">actually two marks on the camshaft gear</text>
  <text start="1525.63" dur="3.73">one in the front and there was one on</text>
  <text start="1527.769" dur="7.111">the back and one in the back was larger</text>
  <text start="1529.36" dur="8.25">and I was like oh gosh I think I&amp;#39;m using</text>
  <text start="1534.88" dur="5.46">the wrong mark so I looked again in the</text>
  <text start="1537.61" dur="4.11">service manual and sure enough there</text>
  <text start="1540.34" dur="4.17">were two marks and I was using the wrong</text>
  <text start="1541.72" dur="4.589">one so I took the gear off I moved it</text>
  <text start="1544.51" dur="4.289">rotated it to where the right mark was</text>
  <text start="1546.309" dur="5.301">to put it back on put the cover back on</text>
  <text start="1548.799" dur="7.191">engines started right up and it ran fine</text>
  <text start="1551.61" dur="8.83">so God gave me a word of knowledge about</text>
  <text start="1555.99" dur="6.76">the timing on my engine being wrong but</text>
  <text start="1560.44" dur="5.31">if I had not calmed myself down and</text>
  <text start="1562.75" dur="4.83">closed my eyes and asked God to show me</text>
  <text start="1565.75" dur="6.45">what was wrong I never would have known</text>
  <text start="1567.58" dur="8.37">that God cares about the little tiny</text>
  <text start="1572.2" dur="6.54">things that you care about way more than</text>
  <text start="1575.95" dur="5.4">you realize if you care about it God</text>
  <text start="1578.74" dur="5.039">cares about it and God wants to help you</text>
  <text start="1581.35" dur="4.14">he wants to help you solve problems if</text>
  <text start="1583.779" dur="4.681">he wants to help get you out of trouble</text>
  <text start="1585.49" dur="5.7">he wants to get people heal okay</text>
  <text start="1588.46" dur="4.99">he is so good he is so compassionate we</text>
  <text start="1591.19" dur="3.82">don&amp;#39;t realize how good he is</text>
  <text start="1593.45" dur="3.599">how much he loves us and how much he</text>
  <text start="1595.01" dur="6.419">wants to help us but it really comes</text>
  <text start="1597.049" dur="7.921">down to learning how to receive</text>
  <text start="1601.429" dur="4.98">revelation envisions through sensations</text>
  <text start="1604.97" dur="5.91">in your body through impressions in your</text>
  <text start="1606.409" dur="7.561">mind that is how God speaks to us so if</text>
  <text start="1610.88" dur="5.7">this is all about relationship it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1613.97" dur="5.16">about having a relationship with God</text>
  <text start="1616.58" dur="5.51">through the spirit and if you&amp;#39;re not</text>
