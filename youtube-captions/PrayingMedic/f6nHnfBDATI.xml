  <text start="146.92" dur="4.2">Christian home I was I was raised by my</text>
  <text start="150.159" dur="3.631">mother</text>
  <text start="151.12" dur="5.91">I was raised back in the 70s is when I</text>
  <text start="153.79" dur="7.259">was a child and divorce wasn&amp;#39;t nearly as</text>
  <text start="157.03" dur="7.44">prevalent as it is today but my mother</text>
  <text start="161.049" dur="7.25">raised me and she&amp;#39;s one of my heroes I</text>
  <text start="164.47" dur="7.829">was born an extremely crippled child and</text>
  <text start="168.299" dur="5.8">physically crippled and so I had a lot</text>
  <text start="172.299" dur="4.321">of obstacles to overcome right right</text>
  <text start="174.099" dur="5.011">from the beginning and my my parents</text>
  <text start="176.62" dur="4.56">divorced very early in my life my dad</text>
  <text start="179.11" dur="4.29">was not really involved in my life</text>
  <text start="181.18" dur="5.339">but my mother had come from a very</text>
  <text start="183.4" dur="7.5">strong Christian family I&amp;#39;m a fourth</text>
  <text start="186.519" dur="7.291">generation kind of minister in my family</text>
  <text start="190.9" dur="7.53">yeah my great-grandfather was a minister</text>
  <text start="193.81" dur="6.36">in Holland and then my grandfather was a</text>
  <text start="198.43" dur="3.57">minister in a church planter here in</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="4.23">California he planted eight or nine</text>
  <text start="202" dur="7.109">churches and most of them are still</text>
  <text start="204.4" dur="7.55">going and then I have an uncle and two</text>
  <text start="209.109" dur="6.06">aunts who are all ordained ministers and</text>
  <text start="211.95" dur="8.05">then myself I&amp;#39;m a trained theologian and</text>
  <text start="215.169" dur="7.261">so I have a strong heritage in the faith</text>
  <text start="220" dur="6.18">and I kind of jokingly say it&amp;#39;s sort of</text>
  <text start="222.43" dur="7.38">the family business and it really is in</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="7.679">your DNA yeah yeah and so my I had a</text>
  <text start="229.81" dur="5.85">very lovely childhood with my mother my</text>
  <text start="233.859" dur="4.141">mother worked very hard she was a</text>
  <text start="235.66" dur="4.68">schoolteacher and she made my life very</text>
  <text start="238" dur="4.41">beautiful considering it was just her</text>
  <text start="240.34" dur="4.92">and I and we had a lot of obstacles and</text>
  <text start="242.41" dur="5.189">we weren&amp;#39;t always well-off monetarily</text>
  <text start="245.26" dur="4.08">but she worked really hard and I got a</text>
  <text start="247.599" dur="4.771">very good education because of her</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="5.16">efforts that&amp;#39;s cool so tell me a little</text>
  <text start="252.37" dur="5.07">bit about the disabilities that you were</text>
  <text start="254.5" dur="5.37">born with yeah I was born with bilateral</text>
  <text start="257.44" dur="5.31">hip dysplasia which basically means I</text>
  <text start="259.87" dur="5.49">had no hip sockets and now it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="262.75" dur="4.65">standard test that they perform right</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="4.71">when you have a baby they&amp;#39;ll do a thing</text>
  <text start="267.4" dur="4.32">where they kind of move the legs to see</text>
  <text start="270.07" dur="4.26">how they move in their hip joints it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="271.72" dur="5.79">just a standard pediatrician test that</text>
  <text start="274.33" dur="6.93">they do now and I don&amp;#39;t know in my case</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="6.12">if it just wasn&amp;#39;t performed or it didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="281.26" dur="3.869">register but they didn&amp;#39;t know I had this</text>
  <text start="283.63" dur="3.989">problem until I was about two year</text>
  <text start="285.129" dur="5.22">old and I still wasn&amp;#39;t walking and I</text>
  <text start="287.619" dur="4.62">finally started walking and my mom</text>
  <text start="290.349" dur="4.38">immediately knew something was wrong I</text>
  <text start="292.239" dur="7.92">just I had no balance I couldn&amp;#39;t walk</text>
  <text start="294.729" dur="8.52">very well and so that started a series</text>
  <text start="300.159" dur="5.4">of events in my life where I was</text>
  <text start="303.249" dur="4.67">hospitalized for a very extended period</text>
  <text start="305.559" dur="4.86">of time and I was put in totally</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="4.9">immobilized in traction so that they</text>
  <text start="310.419" dur="4.32">could set my hip sockets correctly they</text>
  <text start="312.819" dur="3.63">would put weights on my legs everyday</text>
  <text start="314.739" dur="4.14">and spread them further and further</text>
  <text start="316.449" dur="6">apart and then I was put in a full-body</text>
  <text start="318.879" dur="5.94">cast from my armpits down to my to my</text>
  <text start="322.449" dur="4.05">knees and so I couldn&amp;#39;t move I was</text>
  <text start="324.819" dur="3.6">completely immobilized for nine months</text>
  <text start="326.499" dur="4.35">in that body cast and then I wore leg</text>
  <text start="328.419" dur="4.821">braces until I was probably like</text>
  <text start="330.849" dur="4.951">kindergarten first aid first grade and</text>
  <text start="333.24" dur="5.019">it was able to be corrected without</text>
  <text start="335.8" dur="4.5">surgery which was appraised when the</text>
  <text start="338.259" dur="4.32">doctors first diagnosed me they actually</text>
  <text start="340.3" dur="6.019">told my parents that I would probably</text>
  <text start="342.579" dur="7.471">never walk correctly and I went on to</text>
  <text start="346.319" dur="5.08">awkwardly play sports throughout my so</text>
  <text start="350.05" dur="4.949">you&amp;#39;re not a marathon runner but you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="351.399" dur="6.69">doing I still kind of limp around a</text>
  <text start="354.999" dur="5.551">little bit but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just part of</text>
  <text start="358.089" dur="4.38">what makes me unique and I&amp;#39;m just praise</text>
  <text start="360.55" dur="3.869">God every day that I can walk my mother</text>
  <text start="362.469" dur="3.78">had the courage to go through all of</text>
  <text start="364.419" dur="4.92">these procedures so that I could do that</text>
  <text start="366.249" dur="5.1">but that medical experience actually</text>
  <text start="369.339" dur="5.1">played a role in in I think some of the</text>
  <text start="371.349" dur="7.5">early seeds of my mental illness because</text>
  <text start="374.439" dur="6.66">it disrupted the natural bonding between</text>
  <text start="378.849" dur="4.44">my mother and I and as you were in the</text>
  <text start="381.099" dur="3.93">hospital I was in the hospital and then</text>
  <text start="383.289" dur="4.59">I wasn&amp;#39;t really able to be touched or</text>
  <text start="385.029" dur="5.49">held when I had all of these things on</text>
  <text start="387.879" dur="5.731">my body this cast and everything and it</text>
  <text start="390.519" dur="5.61">was really difficult it took me a long</text>
  <text start="393.61" dur="5.099">time to understand the impact that those</text>
  <text start="396.129" dur="5.4">medical situations early in my life that</text>
  <text start="398.709" dur="6.091">I honestly have no memory of what role</text>
  <text start="401.529" dur="5.37">they played in kind of emotionally get</text>
  <text start="404.8" dur="4.379">me getting me off balance and doing</text>
  <text start="406.899" dur="4.11">damage to me and then I think those</text>
  <text start="409.179" dur="5.431">seeds that were planted during that time</text>
  <text start="411.009" dur="6.481">did play a role in later in in my mental</text>
  <text start="414.61" dur="4.29">illness as I as I got older yeah as I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="417.49" dur="4.08">worked with people</text>
  <text start="418.9" dur="4.44">have mental illness you know bipolar</text>
  <text start="421.57" dur="3.87">depression or whatever it is it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="423.34" dur="5.79">becoming pretty clear to me that a lot</text>
  <text start="425.44" dur="5.67">of the genesis of those things are in</text>
  <text start="429.13" dur="4.53">the formative years first two to three</text>
  <text start="431.11" dur="4.8">years of people&amp;#39;s lives where they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="3.72">really have an ability to process and</text>
  <text start="435.91" dur="3.48">comprehend what&amp;#39;s going on around them</text>
  <text start="437.38" dur="4.05">especially difficult situations or</text>
  <text start="439.39" dur="3.51">emotionally traumatic situations yeah</text>
  <text start="441.43" dur="3.57">and I think that the way that that kind</text>
  <text start="442.9" dur="4.59">of showed up for me was that I often</text>
  <text start="445" dur="3.95">wondered like if I had been abused or</text>
  <text start="447.49" dur="3.66">something that I just didn&amp;#39;t remember</text>
  <text start="448.95" dur="3.61">because I would register you know I</text>
  <text start="451.15" dur="3.03">would take these little tests I&amp;#39;m like</text>
  <text start="452.56" dur="3.48">you know have you had a traumatic event</text>
  <text start="454.18" dur="3.96">in your life and I couldn&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="456.04" dur="4.95">remember anything but I would always</text>
  <text start="458.14" dur="5.7">have problems with attachment issues I</text>
  <text start="460.99" dur="5.79">had a lot of anxiety and it wasn&amp;#39;t until</text>
  <text start="463.84" dur="4.86">I was in my 30s that I I when I started</text>
  <text start="466.78" dur="3.48">going to therapy that I realized that</text>
  <text start="468.7" dur="3.6">well I really have like a serious</text>
  <text start="470.26" dur="4.59">attachment disorder how did the</text>
  <text start="472.3" dur="4.26">depression affect you growing up going</text>
  <text start="474.85" dur="4.59">through elementary school middle school</text>
  <text start="476.56" dur="5.46">I always struggled with depression I</text>
  <text start="479.44" dur="4.26">think even in childhood I felt very</text>
  <text start="482.02" dur="5.19">isolated and different I had</text>
  <text start="483.7" dur="5.04">difficulties making friends what I just</text>
  <text start="487.21" dur="4.92">sensed that I was not like other</text>
  <text start="488.74" dur="4.68">children and I had far more needs I was</text>
  <text start="492.13" dur="3.15">a man needy person</text>
  <text start="493.42" dur="4.62">my needs just never felt like they were</text>
  <text start="495.28" dur="5.07">met and again it wasn&amp;#39;t until I went to</text>
  <text start="498.04" dur="5.7">therapy in my 30s that I realized like</text>
  <text start="500.35" dur="5.67">oh this is classic attachment disorder</text>
  <text start="503.74" dur="4.14">but I didn&amp;#39;t know that as a child and so</text>
  <text start="506.02" dur="5.04">often the feedback I would receive from</text>
  <text start="507.88" dur="4.83">peers growing up even through high</text>
  <text start="511.06" dur="5.01">school and college was just I was a very</text>
  <text start="512.71" dur="6.57">needy person and I never knew quite how</text>
  <text start="516.07" dur="4.59">to take that in or what that meant and I</text>
  <text start="519.28" dur="4.05">just knew I was different than other</text>
  <text start="520.66" dur="5.4">people and I was very depressed when I</text>
  <text start="523.33" dur="6.75">was 15 I was a freshman in high school</text>
  <text start="526.06" dur="7.68">and I I was extremely depressed to the</text>
  <text start="530.08" dur="5.61">point of becoming suicidal and I just</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="5.12">thought about killing myself all the</text>
  <text start="535.69" dur="7.98">time daily there was really a time in my</text>
  <text start="538.86" dur="7.45">life as a freshman it was February of my</text>
  <text start="543.67" dur="4.44">freshman year and I kind of picked like</text>
  <text start="546.31" dur="5.07">a date when I was going to kill myself</text>
  <text start="548.11" dur="4.8">and I went to school that day and a</text>
  <text start="551.38" dur="3.3">classmate of mine</text>
  <text start="552.91" dur="3.66">that I didn&amp;#39;t really know all that well</text>
  <text start="554.68" dur="3.51">I went to a fairly small school so we</text>
  <text start="556.57" dur="3.18">all sorted knew each other but he wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="558.19" dur="2.85">like my friend or anything he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="559.75" dur="2.97">know anything personal about me</text>
  <text start="561.04" dur="3.93">but I was put my books away in my locker</text>
  <text start="562.72" dur="3.45">and he comes up to me and he says hey</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="3.78">you know I want to talk to you after</text>
  <text start="566.17" dur="5.31">school God told me something he gave me</text>
  <text start="568.75" dur="3.3">a word for you and then you know let me</text>
  <text start="571.48" dur="2.43">explain</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="4.26">I&amp;#39;m the Baptist girl I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="573.91" dur="5.07">anything about people getting words from</text>
  <text start="576.31" dur="4.02">the Lord and so I was just I knew that</text>
  <text start="578.98" dur="4.23">that was the day that I had planned to</text>
  <text start="580.33" dur="4.62">kill myself later in the day and I so I</text>
  <text start="583.21" dur="3.36">thought well what have I got to lose so</text>
  <text start="584.95" dur="4.77">I went to meet with this guy after</text>
  <text start="586.57" dur="5.91">school and he tells me you know the Lord</text>
  <text start="589.72" dur="6.21">told me yesterday that you wanted to</text>
  <text start="592.48" dur="5.07">kill yourself today and so he shared the</text>
  <text start="595.93" dur="4.59">gospel with me and I ended up really</text>
  <text start="597.55" dur="4.98">making a what I would say is like my</text>
  <text start="600.52" dur="3.96">real profession of faith but although I</text>
  <text start="602.53" dur="4.26">had grown up in the church and I</text>
  <text start="604.48" dur="5.46">believed in Jesus and but I never</text>
  <text start="606.79" dur="6.06">believed that Jesus loved me back</text>
  <text start="609.94" dur="4.47">I was just so emotionally broken because</text>
  <text start="612.85" dur="3.24">I think of these attachment problems</text>
  <text start="614.41" dur="2.91">that I had I couldn&amp;#39;t conceive that God</text>
  <text start="616.09" dur="3.24">could actually love me</text>
  <text start="617.32" dur="4.38">did you think that you were unlovable I</text>
  <text start="619.33" dur="3.6">pretty much did I had massive like</text>
  <text start="621.7" dur="4.92">rejection issues</text>
  <text start="622.93" dur="5.76">I felt perpetually worthless and you</text>
  <text start="626.62" dur="3.42">probably figured if if my friends and</text>
  <text start="628.69" dur="3.18">people around me can&amp;#39;t stand to be</text>
  <text start="630.04" dur="4.59">around me god sure probably doesn&amp;#39;t love</text>
  <text start="631.87" dur="4.53">me exactly because he knows stuff that</text>
  <text start="634.63" dur="3.57">people don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s right and he</text>
  <text start="636.4" dur="3.15">you know he know he knows about my sin</text>
  <text start="638.2" dur="5.1">and all the things I think I&amp;#39;m hiding</text>
  <text start="639.55" dur="5.28">from other people and so when I came to</text>
  <text start="643.3" dur="3.75">Christ that day it was really the first</text>
  <text start="644.83" dur="3.93">time I knew that God loved me like he</text>
  <text start="647.05" dur="5.01">had told this guy that I didn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="648.76" dur="7.14">really know hey I value you and he gave</text>
  <text start="652.06" dur="6.9">me a prophetic word of God has a plan</text>
  <text start="655.9" dur="5.45">for your life and God&amp;#39;s gonna do</text>
  <text start="658.96" dur="6.74">something really great with you and that</text>
  <text start="661.35" dur="7">single word brought life to me a</text>
  <text start="665.7" dur="4.93">life-changing word of my life from a</text>
  <text start="668.35" dur="4.08">stranger it was that crazy and it&amp;#39;s so</text>
  <text start="670.63" dur="3.24">crazy and he didn&amp;#39;t come back to my</text>
  <text start="672.43" dur="3.33">school the next year he moved away to</text>
  <text start="673.87" dur="6.54">Idaho I&amp;#39;ve never been able to find this</text>
  <text start="675.76" dur="6.57">guy but him and another gal really were</text>
  <text start="680.41" dur="3.72">formative at that very beginning and</text>
  <text start="682.33" dur="4.439">getting me you know filled with the Holy</text>
  <text start="684.13" dur="4.35">Spirit and getting me on my way</text>
  <text start="686.769" dur="5.97">I only knew them for a couple of months</text>
  <text start="688.48" dur="6.269">but that foundational experience set me</text>
  <text start="692.739" dur="3.6">up to get me through a lot of really</text>
  <text start="694.749" dur="3.27">difficult times in my life that were</text>
  <text start="696.339" dur="3.6">coming because you had some very</text>
  <text start="698.019" dur="4.35">difficult times coming I did yeah</text>
  <text start="699.939" dur="5.101">when were you first diagnosed with</text>
  <text start="702.369" dur="7.14">bipolar yeah is it later yes much later</text>
  <text start="705.04" dur="5.88">I was diagnosed when I was 35 well let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="709.509" dur="3.24">let&amp;#39;s go back to your teenage times</text>
  <text start="710.92" dur="4.469">because then were you diagnosed with</text>
  <text start="712.749" dur="4.53">depression no I I didn&amp;#39;t that was also</text>
  <text start="715.389" dur="4.32">later yeah I didn&amp;#39;t even know anything</text>
  <text start="717.279" dur="4.321">about depression or mental illness or no</text>
  <text start="719.709" dur="4.62">you weren&amp;#39;t going to counseling any</text>
  <text start="721.6" dur="5.399">medication yeah high school when I went</text>
  <text start="724.329" dur="5.25">to college I went to a Christian</text>
  <text start="726.999" dur="5.82">University and I struggled with that</text>
  <text start="729.579" dur="6.42">transition into college and my friends</text>
  <text start="732.819" dur="4.38">were wise enough at the university that</text>
  <text start="735.999" dur="2.64">even though they didn&amp;#39;t know me very</text>
  <text start="737.199" dur="3.39">well and they just met me and we were</text>
  <text start="738.639" dur="4.68">all freshmen together they knew I was</text>
  <text start="740.589" dur="4.891">deeply troubled and they recommended</text>
  <text start="743.319" dur="5.911">that I go to the Counseling Center at</text>
  <text start="745.48" dur="5.729">the school and one of them even like</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="5.219">said I&amp;#39;ll walk with you over there you</text>
  <text start="751.209" dur="5.461">know she was she was really had the</text>
  <text start="754.449" dur="5.791">vision of what could happen there for</text>
  <text start="756.67" dur="5.25">healing wise for me so I went started</text>
  <text start="760.24" dur="3.3">going to counseling at the University</text>
  <text start="761.92" dur="5.459">Counseling Center and I did that for a</text>
  <text start="763.54" dur="6.839">few years and I did work on some issues</text>
  <text start="767.379" dur="6.63">but overall I didn&amp;#39;t really see much</text>
  <text start="770.379" dur="6.481">progress at that time but I did make it</text>
  <text start="774.009" dur="6.3">through college I did well I graduated</text>
  <text start="776.86" dur="7.62">with honors then I went on to seminary</text>
  <text start="780.309" dur="6.78">and for me seminary I know seminary</text>
  <text start="784.48" dur="4.649">takes a lot of a bad rap for a lot of</text>
  <text start="787.089" dur="4.651">Christians they call it cemetery and</text>
  <text start="789.129" dur="4.89">they say they make fun of it but for me</text>
  <text start="791.74" dur="5.55">that was such a life-giving experience</text>
  <text start="794.019" dur="6.81">because I discovered that God made me</text>
  <text start="797.29" dur="7.379">for a purpose and that purpose was that</text>
  <text start="800.829" dur="7.711">I was a gifted teacher and that I could</text>
  <text start="804.669" dur="7.53">teach other people theology and theology</text>
  <text start="808.54" dur="6.12">for me became sanity right because the</text>
  <text start="812.199" dur="4.591">key thing that you have to understand if</text>
  <text start="814.66" dur="4.049">you&amp;#39;re going to overcome anything that</text>
  <text start="816.79" dur="3.57">the enemy is trying to throw at you you</text>
  <text start="818.709" dur="3.63">have to know what your purpose is</text>
  <text start="820.36" dur="4.229">for existence yes if you don&amp;#39;t know that</text>
  <text start="822.339" dur="5.341">you&amp;#39;re pretty much way behind in the</text>
  <text start="824.589" dur="6.18">game and you figured that out yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="827.68" dur="5.79">so my senior year of college I had a</text>
  <text start="830.769" dur="4.5">great theology professor and he really</text>
  <text start="833.47" dur="4.38">encouraged me and so then I went on to</text>
  <text start="835.269" dur="5.19">seminary and one of my seminary</text>
  <text start="837.85" dur="3.96">professors kind of pulled me aside one</text>
  <text start="840.459" dur="3.75">day and said hey have you ever thought</text>
  <text start="841.81" dur="4.68">about doing this as a career and I</text>
  <text start="844.209" dur="5.041">thought this is a career me going to</text>
  <text start="846.49" dur="5.279">school I don&amp;#39;t I&amp;#39;m confused I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="849.25" dur="4.829">even know what a theologian was I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="851.769" dur="5.82">understand the world of academia I was</text>
  <text start="854.079" dur="5.581">just taking classes because structure or</text>
  <text start="857.589" dur="4.5">helped me deal with what I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="859.66" dur="3.53">understand was a mental illness right</text>
  <text start="862.089" dur="3.891">now I&amp;#39;m guessing this was a</text>
  <text start="863.19" dur="5.05">fundamentalist perspective that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="865.98" dur="4.479">broadly fundamentalist not harshly</text>
  <text start="868.24" dur="5.61">fundable not curious man no not</text>
  <text start="870.459" dur="6.06">charismatic no and the structure of the</text>
  <text start="873.85" dur="6.71">classes and learning about who God</text>
  <text start="876.519" dur="6.871">really was helped correct a lot of</text>
  <text start="880.56" dur="6.07">misunderstandings I had about God so the</text>
  <text start="883.39" dur="5.939">more truth I got in me the more that my</text>
  <text start="886.63" dur="5.639">myself I noticed that my thoughts could</text>
  <text start="889.329" dur="5.88">become more ordered the more that I</text>
  <text start="892.269" dur="5.851">studied theology and logic and so even</text>
  <text start="895.209" dur="4.951">if I had a chaotic internal emotional</text>
  <text start="898.12" dur="5.459">life I learned how to kind of</text>
  <text start="900.16" dur="6.69">restructure my thought life by using</text>
  <text start="903.579" dur="7.921">theology philosophy and logic as a way</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="6.169">to kind of self-medicate in a way and I</text>
  <text start="911.5" dur="4.19">think that my Christian upbringing</text>
  <text start="913.019" dur="5.141">helped me because it did put some</text>
  <text start="915.69" dur="4.269">boundaries in place of certain places I</text>
  <text start="918.16" dur="5.1">wasn&amp;#39;t gonna go I wasn&amp;#39;t going to take</text>
  <text start="919.959" dur="7.651">drugs I wasn&amp;#39;t going to engage in risky</text>
  <text start="923.26" dur="6.84">sex I wasn&amp;#39;t going to become an</text>
  <text start="927.61" dur="5.729">alcoholic all of those things seemed</text>
  <text start="930.1" dur="5.4">like I could do them like sin was</text>
  <text start="933.339" dur="4.831">crouching up my door and if I ever went</text>
  <text start="935.5" dur="4.38">down that path I knew I would have</text>
  <text start="938.17" dur="5.46">problems but something in me knew that</text>
  <text start="939.88" dur="6.12">if I ever tried to go drinking I would</text>
  <text start="943.63" dur="4.079">be an alcoholic after like three drinks</text>
  <text start="946" dur="4.47">and I would be living in the gutter</text>
  <text start="947.709" dur="5.911">that&amp;#39;s really interesting and and you</text>
  <text start="950.47" dur="3.809">touched on the second what I would say</text>
  <text start="953.62" dur="3.3">is this</text>
  <text start="954.279" dur="4.8">second pillar of good mental health</text>
  <text start="956.92" dur="4.469">number one is knowing who you are and</text>
  <text start="959.079" dur="4.17">knowing something about your purpose in</text>
  <text start="961.389" dur="4.921">your destiny and why God created you</text>
  <text start="963.249" dur="5.611">number two is knowing some things about</text>
  <text start="966.31" dur="4.769">God that are true because most of the</text>
  <text start="968.86" dur="5.459">people that I know whose really struggle</text>
  <text start="971.079" dur="5.401">they either have no sense of who they</text>
  <text start="974.319" dur="4.981">are and they also have a lot of wrong</text>
  <text start="976.48" dur="5.339">beliefs about God yeah and if you can</text>
  <text start="979.3" dur="5.039">start to get your understanding of who</text>
  <text start="981.819" dur="4.921">God is and who you are straightened out</text>
  <text start="984.339" dur="5.881">a little bit and untangle some of the</text>
  <text start="986.74" dur="6.24">the mess yeah it becomes a lot easier to</text>
  <text start="990.22" dur="5.669">deflect the arrows of the enemy which</text>
  <text start="992.98" dur="5.94">are coming at you 24/7 for me that was a</text>
  <text start="995.889" dur="6.021">very powerful drug if you will that was</text>
  <text start="998.92" dur="5.609">how I made it through my 20s was really</text>
  <text start="1001.91" dur="4.659">trying to correct my thinking and I</text>
  <text start="1004.529" dur="6.091">noticed that there was relief in that I</text>
  <text start="1006.569" dur="6.231">had my first child when I was 29 I had</text>
  <text start="1010.62" dur="5.31">anticipated a career in as a</text>
  <text start="1012.8" dur="6.07">professional theologian like teaching at</text>
  <text start="1015.93" dur="5.04">the University but thankfully in God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1018.87" dur="5.789">grace he had a different plan for me and</text>
  <text start="1020.97" dur="7.38">he sent me my daughter Emily who is now</text>
  <text start="1024.659" dur="6.39">16 and she was an amazing gift to me but</text>
  <text start="1028.35" dur="5.37">she was also an incredible disruption to</text>
  <text start="1031.049" dur="4.65">my mental illness and as it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="1033.72" dur="4.8">typical with mental illness major life</text>
  <text start="1035.699" dur="5.25">transitions tend to cause the person to</text>
  <text start="1038.52" dur="4.919">kind of go down a rung you know my first</text>
  <text start="1040.949" dur="5.431">year of college my first year of</text>
  <text start="1043.439" dur="5.37">teaching my first year of being a mom</text>
  <text start="1046.38" dur="5.299">all of these things kind of helped me</text>
  <text start="1048.809" dur="6.901">spiral down and that&amp;#39;s very typical and</text>
  <text start="1051.679" dur="7.601">I struggled with being a mother I loved</text>
  <text start="1055.71" dur="7.589">my child deeply but my inner life had</text>
  <text start="1059.28" dur="7.68">become incredibly chaotic and I was</text>
  <text start="1063.299" dur="5.25">extremely depressed and suicidal right</text>
  <text start="1066.96" dur="4.589">well if you struggle with depression</text>
  <text start="1068.549" dur="4.86">already the specter of postpartum</text>
  <text start="1071.549" dur="3.901">depression is hanging over you yeah and</text>
  <text start="1073.409" dur="3.961">I know a lot of people who have never</text>
  <text start="1075.45" dur="4.349">had depression in their life but once</text>
  <text start="1077.37" dur="4.049">they had their first child they struggle</text>
  <text start="1079.799" dur="4.74">with postpartum depression for years</text>
  <text start="1081.419" dur="6.481">afterward it was it was a very dark time</text>
  <text start="1084.539" dur="7.561">for me and then I had my second</text>
  <text start="1087.9" dur="6.18">child in 2003 and then that was just</text>
  <text start="1092.1" dur="6.32">another rung down the ladder and by that</text>
  <text start="1094.08" dur="9.39">point I was almost non-functional I was</text>
  <text start="1098.42" dur="7.65">working a little bit but mostly relying</text>
  <text start="1103.47" dur="5.52">on my husband I was extremely depressed</text>
  <text start="1106.07" dur="6.52">it was difficult for me to care for my</text>
  <text start="1108.99" dur="6.3">children I was just mostly trying to</text>
  <text start="1112.59" dur="6.17">hang on in my day to day life and I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1115.29" dur="6.77">never forget my husband who is a very</text>
  <text start="1118.76" dur="6.19">patient and long-suffering person</text>
  <text start="1122.06" dur="5.02">sitting me down on our bed and and</text>
  <text start="1124.95" dur="4.08">saying you know hey you got to get some</text>
  <text start="1127.08" dur="3.78">yeah I get some professional help this</text>
  <text start="1129.03" dur="5.04">this isn&amp;#39;t working for me</text>
  <text start="1130.86" dur="6.63">I was extremely resistant at the time I</text>
  <text start="1134.07" dur="6.74">thought why not the problem what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1137.49" dur="6.96">what&amp;#39;s the problem here and denial yeah</text>
  <text start="1140.81" dur="5.95">pretty much well now he also was</text>
  <text start="1144.45" dur="5.07">struggling himself yes and we didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1146.76" dur="5.28">really completely understand the depths</text>
  <text start="1149.52" dur="5.52">of that at the time but yeah he had</text>
  <text start="1152.04" dur="5.31">struggled with low low-grade long-term</text>
  <text start="1155.04" dur="4.5">depression for most of his life as well</text>
  <text start="1157.35" dur="3.99">I think in the beginning one of the</text>
  <text start="1159.54" dur="4.17">reasons we were actually attracted to</text>
  <text start="1161.34" dur="5.13">each other was that we both had some</text>
  <text start="1163.71" dur="5.28">similar struggles and we found comfort</text>
  <text start="1166.47" dur="4.83">in each other that we could kind of help</text>
  <text start="1168.99" dur="4.14">each other you know we had both felt</text>
  <text start="1171.3" dur="3.93">isolated childhoods that we&amp;#39;ve both been</text>
  <text start="1173.13" dur="4.38">kind of different and and we had both</text>
  <text start="1175.23" dur="3.51">suffered from from depression only we</text>
  <text start="1177.51" dur="3.69">didn&amp;#39;t know that that&amp;#39;s what that was</text>
  <text start="1178.74" dur="4.41">but there were enough things that about</text>
  <text start="1181.2" dur="4.5">us that were similar that that was part</text>
  <text start="1183.15" dur="4.71">of the attraction but then as often</text>
  <text start="1185.7" dur="3.66">happens is one day you you wake up and</text>
  <text start="1187.86" dur="3.96">you realize I don&amp;#39;t think I want to be</text>
  <text start="1189.36" dur="5.82">sick anymore and you try to start</text>
  <text start="1191.82" dur="5.34">getting better and it&amp;#39;s hard if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1195.18" dur="4.95">not both in that process of getting</text>
  <text start="1197.16" dur="4.62">better what often happens is one spouse</text>
  <text start="1200.13" dur="3.99">wants to stay sick and the other one</text>
  <text start="1201.78" dur="5.94">wants to get better and that&amp;#39;s sometimes</text>
  <text start="1204.12" dur="5.78">why divorce ends up happening but for</text>
  <text start="1207.72" dur="4.5">both of us we&amp;#39;ve both been in long-term</text>
  <text start="1209.9" dur="5.32">struggles with mental illness and just</text>
  <text start="1212.22" dur="7.53">didn&amp;#39;t know it and he had gone to many</text>
  <text start="1215.22" dur="6.57">therapists off and on when I knew him in</text>
  <text start="1219.75" dur="3.54">college he had gone to</text>
  <text start="1221.79" dur="3.6">and when I was in graduate school he</text>
  <text start="1223.29" dur="4.56">went to another one and he had but he</text>
  <text start="1225.39" dur="4.59">had found very little relief no he no</text>
  <text start="1227.85" dur="6.09">did he take any kind of antidepressant</text>
  <text start="1229.98" dur="6.81">he did not and it wasn&amp;#39;t until in his</text>
  <text start="1233.94" dur="5.73">mid-30s he tried a couple of times but</text>
  <text start="1236.79" dur="5.37">he just didn&amp;#39;t get any relief from it in</text>
  <text start="1239.67" dur="5.49">fact it just made things worse and so he</text>
  <text start="1242.16" dur="5.55">it wasn&amp;#39;t something that he was really</text>
  <text start="1245.16" dur="4.8">that interested in pursuing right I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1247.71" dur="4.53">gonna put in a little plug here just</text>
  <text start="1249.96" dur="3.87">just a warning basically I am an</text>
  <text start="1252.24" dur="3.3">advocate of people taking their</text>
  <text start="1253.83" dur="3.84">medications if they&amp;#39;ve been prescribed</text>
  <text start="1255.54" dur="3.9">antidepressants and if the</text>
  <text start="1257.67" dur="3.39">antidepressant is actually helping you</text>
  <text start="1259.44" dur="4.23">when you&amp;#39;re on it I think you should</text>
  <text start="1261.06" dur="4.92">stay on it yeah I see way too many</text>
  <text start="1263.67" dur="3.54">people who go off their medications</text>
  <text start="1265.98" dur="2.64">because they don&amp;#39;t like some side</text>
  <text start="1267.21" dur="3.21">effects and the next thing you know</text>
  <text start="1268.62" dur="3.54">they&amp;#39;re in the emergency department</text>
  <text start="1270.42" dur="3.51">because they slit their wrists or they</text>
  <text start="1272.16" dur="4.46">took an overdose that&amp;#39;s a good one yeah</text>
  <text start="1273.93" dur="6.24">I I always recommend to people look</text>
  <text start="1276.62" dur="5.35">until you find the ultimate solution if</text>
  <text start="1280.17" dur="3.96">prescription medications are helping you</text>
  <text start="1281.97" dur="3.99">just keep taking them I totally agree</text>
  <text start="1284.13" dur="4.47">and I&amp;#39;m always a big advocate for that</text>
  <text start="1285.96" dur="4.08">as well and like I said when when my</text>
  <text start="1288.6" dur="3.24">husband came to me and wanted me to go</text>
  <text start="1290.04" dur="3.33">to therapy I was resisted it took me</text>
  <text start="1291.84" dur="4.8">about six more months before I actually</text>
  <text start="1293.37" dur="6.74">called the therapist and another six</text>
  <text start="1296.64" dur="7.59">months before I actually started going</text>
  <text start="1300.11" dur="7.48">but once I started going I I went to</text>
  <text start="1304.23" dur="6.63">therapy one to two times a week for ten</text>
  <text start="1307.59" dur="5.79">years and I had a very good therapist</text>
  <text start="1310.86" dur="5.49">I&amp;#39;m a very big advocate that if a</text>
  <text start="1313.38" dur="5.37">therapist is not working for you switch</text>
  <text start="1316.35" dur="6.51">therapist keep trying until you find</text>
  <text start="1318.75" dur="6.66">somebody that you click with and that is</text>
  <text start="1322.86" dur="5.01">competent the therapist I had was a</text>
  <text start="1325.41" dur="6.63">Christian and she&amp;#39;s extremely competent</text>
  <text start="1327.87" dur="7.26">and very smart and I needed someone who</text>
  <text start="1332.04" dur="10.32">was a little smarter than me so that I</text>
  <text start="1335.13" dur="9.68">couldn&amp;#39;t just lie to them but it was it</text>
  <text start="1342.36" dur="7.56">was a very positive experience and I</text>
  <text start="1344.81" dur="8.32">learned a lot I grew a lot it was useful</text>
  <text start="1349.92" dur="5.67">I became stabilized and then she was one</text>
  <text start="1353.13" dur="4.95">that recommended that I finally go to a</text>
  <text start="1355.59" dur="4.949">psychiatrist and see about medication</text>
  <text start="1358.08" dur="6.03">okay she was the one who said you know I</text>
  <text start="1360.539" dur="5.221">think you might be depressed and I just</text>
  <text start="1364.11" dur="4.679">said I don&amp;#39;t think I know what that is</text>
  <text start="1365.76" dur="5.549">and she says she gave me a referral to</text>
  <text start="1368.789" dur="7.26">psychiatrists I went to the psychiatrist</text>
  <text start="1371.309" dur="6.99">and he gave me a long intake he asked me</text>
  <text start="1376.049" dur="4.051">questions for about 45 minutes to try to</text>
  <text start="1378.299" dur="3.721">really zero in on the problem and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1380.1" dur="3.42">another thing I recommend that if</text>
  <text start="1382.02" dur="4.2">somebody is struggling with mental</text>
  <text start="1383.52" dur="5.34">illness if you go to a psychiatrist and</text>
  <text start="1386.22" dur="4.92">they don&amp;#39;t ask a lot of questions they</text>
  <text start="1388.86" dur="3.569">just want to prescribe medication you</text>
  <text start="1391.14" dur="4.08">probably need to switch your</text>
  <text start="1392.429" dur="4.831">psychiatrist you need somebody that</text>
  <text start="1395.22" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s some psychiatrists that are just</text>
  <text start="1397.26" dur="4.38">what I call pill farms they&amp;#39;ll just give</text>
  <text start="1399.6" dur="5.22">you the pills they don&amp;#39;t hardly even try</text>
  <text start="1401.64" dur="7.2">to diagnose you and it&amp;#39;s very important</text>
  <text start="1404.82" dur="5.579">that people ask questions of the patient</text>
  <text start="1408.84" dur="3.24">to really zero in on it because there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1410.399" dur="3.481">there&amp;#39;s not a lot of you know there&amp;#39;s no</text>
  <text start="1412.08" dur="3.719">blood tests they can give you that</text>
  <text start="1413.88" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re bipolar or whatever it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1415.799" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s not like that so they have to ask</text>
  <text start="1418.62" dur="4.74">enough questions to get to a diagnosis</text>
  <text start="1420.779" dur="5.691">so he at first he diagnosed me as being</text>
  <text start="1423.36" dur="7.41">depressed put me on antidepressants and</text>
  <text start="1426.47" dur="5.92">I got better I got a lot better and for</text>
  <text start="1430.77" dur="4.23">the first time in my life I started</text>
  <text start="1432.39" dur="6.09">thinking more clearly and I thought wow</text>
  <text start="1435" dur="6.419">this is this is amazing I never knew</text>
  <text start="1438.48" dur="5.4">this was even possible and things really</text>
  <text start="1441.419" dur="4.89">started going better for me at work I</text>
  <text start="1443.88" dur="7.049">got a promotion I was able to work more</text>
  <text start="1446.309" dur="7.531">I started speaking more and then ten</text>
  <text start="1450.929" dur="7.291">months after I started antidepressants I</text>
  <text start="1453.84" dur="7.35">had the worst crash of my life I was in</text>
  <text start="1458.22" dur="5.579">Hawaii on a business trip I was on a</text>
  <text start="1461.19" dur="6.33">speaking trip and I started having</text>
  <text start="1463.799" dur="5.791">hallucinations about knives being on the</text>
  <text start="1467.52" dur="5.12">wall and they were attacking me they</text>
  <text start="1469.59" dur="5.939">were flying in at me and I was having</text>
  <text start="1472.64" dur="5.769">overwhelming thoughts of killing myself</text>
  <text start="1475.529" dur="6.361">and I just was trying to make it through</text>
  <text start="1478.409" dur="5.101">the trip so that I could go home and go</text>
  <text start="1481.89" dur="4.409">see the doctor and find out what was</text>
  <text start="1483.51" dur="5.649">going on and I got back and I was</text>
  <text start="1486.299" dur="4">immediately it was</text>
  <text start="1489.159" dur="3.39">recommended that I check into the</text>
  <text start="1490.299" dur="3.99">psychiatric hospital and I was in the</text>
  <text start="1492.549" dur="4.83">psychiatric hospital for three months</text>
  <text start="1494.289" dur="8.13">after that so I went from the highest of</text>
  <text start="1497.379" dur="7.88">highs to the lowest of lows and it was a</text>
  <text start="1502.419" dur="6.56">long road back after that but that</text>
  <text start="1505.259" dur="5.89">hospitalization in 2005-2006 is when I</text>
  <text start="1508.979" dur="4.81">received my diagnosis</text>
  <text start="1511.149" dur="4.821">finally the correct diagnosis that I was</text>
  <text start="1513.789" dur="6.781">actually bipolar and not just depressed</text>
  <text start="1515.97" dur="6.639">okay now your your manifestation of</text>
  <text start="1520.57" dur="3.929">bipolar is a little different than kind</text>
  <text start="1522.609" dur="4.351">of the classic yes which is you have</text>
  <text start="1524.499" dur="3.961">these real high manic phases where</text>
  <text start="1526.96" dur="3.689">you&amp;#39;re talking a million miles an hour</text>
  <text start="1528.46" dur="4.349">and everything is great and you can have</text>
  <text start="1530.649" dur="4.35">the strength of Superman and then BAM</text>
  <text start="1532.809" dur="3.57">you crash into these really low</text>
  <text start="1534.999" dur="3.75">depressive States and you go back and</text>
  <text start="1536.379" dur="2.91">forth between them yeah it wasn&amp;#39;t like</text>
  <text start="1538.749" dur="3.331">that all right</text>
  <text start="1539.289" dur="5.85">so most of the emerging research</text>
  <text start="1542.08" dur="5.579">recently in the last five years is the</text>
  <text start="1545.139" dur="5.431">theory that bipolar is actually sort of</text>
  <text start="1547.659" dur="6">a spectrum disorder much like autism and</text>
  <text start="1550.57" dur="5.489">so it can manifest in different ways</text>
  <text start="1553.659" dur="5.311">into different degrees the classic</text>
  <text start="1556.059" dur="6.151">bipolar which I&amp;#39;m a famous example might</text>
  <text start="1558.97" dur="5.939">be Patty Duke or Carrie Fisher they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1562.21" dur="5.49">more classic bipolar people and they now</text>
  <text start="1564.909" dur="4.77">classify that as being bipolar type one</text>
  <text start="1567.7" dur="4.62">where you have the highs of highs and</text>
  <text start="1569.679" dur="5.67">the lows the low lows the type of</text>
  <text start="1572.32" dur="5.929">bipolar that I had is called type 2</text>
  <text start="1575.349" dur="8.18">bipolar which is long term depression</text>
  <text start="1578.249" dur="8.711">with short spikes of manic episodes and</text>
  <text start="1583.529" dur="10.21">the my manic episodes might last between</text>
  <text start="1586.96" dur="9.539">3 to 7 days and the way that my manic</text>
  <text start="1593.739" dur="6.231">periods would manifest was usually</text>
  <text start="1596.499" dur="11.64">through I would be able to write an</text>
  <text start="1599.97" dur="10.509">extremely volumous amount of so you had</text>
  <text start="1608.139" dur="5.28">extreme motivation to write yes and so</text>
  <text start="1610.479" dur="6.481">in 2005 when I was at my worst when I</text>
  <text start="1613.419" dur="4.74">was I had three major cycles in 2005 and</text>
  <text start="1616.96" dur="5.94">I didn&amp;#39;t know that that&amp;#39;s what they were</text>
  <text start="1618.159" dur="8.341">until I crashed in October of 2005 I</text>
  <text start="1622.9" dur="7.92">wrote like three books in one year and I</text>
  <text start="1626.5" dur="5.76">wonder if I have bipolar article</text>
  <text start="1630.82" dur="3">published I mean that&amp;#39;s why I said I</text>
  <text start="1632.26" dur="3.99">went from the highest of highs it was</text>
  <text start="1633.82" dur="6.09">like success was finally clicking for me</text>
  <text start="1636.25" dur="5.85">and I remember when I was in the</text>
  <text start="1639.91" dur="4.44">psychiatric hospital the psychiatrist</text>
  <text start="1642.1" dur="5.07">asking me well well does what you write</text>
  <text start="1644.35" dur="5.37">make any sense and I said oh yeah I got</text>
  <text start="1647.17" dur="4.95">a I got a journal article published and</text>
  <text start="1649.72" dur="5.25">and you know I got this other book</text>
  <text start="1652.12" dur="5.34">published through my my employer and it</text>
  <text start="1654.97" dur="5.7">was like but I was driving my co-workers</text>
  <text start="1657.46" dur="4.8">crazy because I would just just write</text>
  <text start="1660.67" dur="3.63">all this stuff and then of course they</text>
  <text start="1662.26" dur="3.72">would have to edit it and figure out how</text>
  <text start="1664.3" dur="4.86">to produce it and what they were gonna</text>
  <text start="1665.98" dur="5.28">do with it and I wasn&amp;#39;t a very good team</text>
  <text start="1669.16" dur="4.65">player because I was just sort of in my</text>
  <text start="1671.26" dur="5.85">own little bubble of you know this is</text>
  <text start="1673.81" dur="5.88">what I&amp;#39;m doing and so it was a it was</text>
  <text start="1677.11" dur="6.93">rough from my co-workers</text>
  <text start="1679.69" dur="6.99">it was rough for my family I was just</text>
  <text start="1684.04" dur="6.33">really out of touch with them</text>
  <text start="1686.68" dur="6.54">emotionally and and physically I was</text>
  <text start="1690.37" dur="4.89">just kind of in my own little world but</text>
  <text start="1693.22" dur="5.42">one of the things that made my bipolar</text>
  <text start="1695.26" dur="6.96">so difficult to diagnosis I was real</text>
  <text start="1698.64" dur="5.59">untypical in that I didn&amp;#39;t take drugs I</text>
  <text start="1702.22" dur="4.8">wasn&amp;#39;t an alcoholic I hadn&amp;#39;t been in</text>
  <text start="1704.23" dur="3.6">jail I was still married I had the same</text>
  <text start="1707.02" dur="2.94">job</text>
  <text start="1707.83" dur="4.62">you were very high-functioning yes</text>
  <text start="1709.96" dur="4.65">bipolar and because most of the people</text>
  <text start="1712.45" dur="4.05">that I know who are bipolar they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1714.61" dur="4.53">high-functioning their life is a mess</text>
  <text start="1716.5" dur="4.5">and they can&amp;#39;t cope yeah so and I I</text>
  <text start="1719.14" dur="3.51">understand that and I was always on the</text>
  <text start="1721" dur="3.93">edge of that and I don&amp;#39;t think I could</text>
  <text start="1722.65" dur="4.71">have kept it up for very much longer but</text>
  <text start="1724.93" dur="4.47">I think I was just really into like</text>
  <text start="1727.36" dur="5.22">keeping certain social conventions and</text>
  <text start="1729.4" dur="5.16">so I I was able to sort of maneuver my</text>
  <text start="1732.58" dur="4.71">way through it but again I think that</text>
  <text start="1734.56" dur="5.48">that&amp;#39;s where my work in my intellectual</text>
  <text start="1737.29" dur="7.56">life also helped me in and having those</text>
  <text start="1740.04" dur="8.77">logic skills but I went on medication in</text>
  <text start="1744.85" dur="7.17">2005 and I was big proponent of that I</text>
  <text start="1748.81" dur="6">wanted to be the poster child for being</text>
  <text start="1752.02" dur="4.529">responsible with your treatment and</text>
  <text start="1754.81" dur="4.199">taking medication and be</text>
  <text start="1756.549" dur="5.1">study about that and not going off and</text>
  <text start="1759.009" dur="4.74">and going to your therapy appointments</text>
  <text start="1761.649" dur="4.65">and you know people looked me up though</text>
  <text start="1763.749" dur="5.61">they&amp;#39;ll see I was featured in Charles</text>
  <text start="1766.299" dur="6.42">families in touch magazine as being a</text>
  <text start="1769.359" dur="5.79">kind of a mental health advocate a few</text>
  <text start="1772.719" dur="4.89">years ago I&amp;#39;m a big proponent of that</text>
  <text start="1775.149" dur="4.65">you were on medication and then you had</text>
  <text start="1777.609" dur="4.02">the crash yeah then I got the right</text>
  <text start="1779.799" dur="4.08">diagnosis though then you got the right</text>
  <text start="1781.629" dur="3.691">diagnosis of bipolar yeah so they put</text>
  <text start="1783.879" dur="3.17">you on different medication I&amp;#39;m guessing</text>
  <text start="1785.32" dur="3.719">so how that works is that</text>
  <text start="1787.049" dur="4.24">antidepressants is good for what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1789.039" dur="4.92">called unipolar which is depression</text>
  <text start="1791.289" dur="4.05">bipolar is you got to regulate both the</text>
  <text start="1793.959" dur="3.39">highs and the lows and and that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1795.339" dur="4.62">different classification of medications</text>
  <text start="1797.349" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s mood stabilizers so I put on a</text>
  <text start="1799.959" dur="7.19">mood stabilizer and was on that</text>
  <text start="1803.079" dur="7.65">faithfully until about 15 16 months ago</text>
  <text start="1807.149" dur="5.88">okay so you went off what were you</text>
  <text start="1810.729" dur="5.49">taking just out of curiosity</text>
  <text start="1813.029" dur="5.53">and that was pretty much the only thing</text>
  <text start="1816.219" dur="5.64">that I was on I did take anxiety</text>
  <text start="1818.559" dur="5.4">medication too but on an as-needed basis</text>
  <text start="1821.859" dur="5.37">it wasn&amp;#39;t a daily thing it was just as I</text>
  <text start="1823.959" dur="4.8">had anxiety attacks I would take it did</text>
  <text start="1827.229" dur="5.37">you suffer any side effects from lithium</text>
  <text start="1828.759" dur="6.3">I Daniel yeah every medication I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="1832.599" dur="4.71">on is had different side effects I was</text>
  <text start="1835.059" dur="3.96">on depakote for many years I had a lot</text>
  <text start="1837.309" dur="6.72">of weight gain that I still struggle</text>
  <text start="1839.019" dur="6.27">with when I was on depakote it was that</text>
  <text start="1844.029" dur="4.14">was one of the more difficult side</text>
  <text start="1845.289" dur="6.72">effects for me I had a lot of problems</text>
  <text start="1848.169" dur="7.89">sleeping sleeping was a big issue I had</text>
  <text start="1852.009" dur="7.23">issues when I was on lithium as well had</text>
  <text start="1856.059" dur="5.34">very strange dreams a lot of the time</text>
  <text start="1859.239" dur="4.17">which now I kind of have a different</text>
  <text start="1861.399" dur="4.41">thought about that on the side of my</text>
  <text start="1863.409" dur="4.59">experience but that those early didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1865.809" dur="4.02">start until I started taking lithium but</text>
  <text start="1867.999" dur="4.68">yeah there were side effects every every</text>
  <text start="1869.829" dur="4.98">medication I had had had its pros and</text>
  <text start="1872.679" dur="4.56">cons but I always felt like I would</text>
  <text start="1874.809" dur="5.011">rather deal with that stay married be</text>
  <text start="1877.239" dur="5.461">with my kids not be in jail so I was</text>
  <text start="1879.82" dur="6.479">willing to to talk it&amp;#39;s a trade-off</text>
  <text start="1882.7" dur="4.469">exactly so what prompted you to seek</text>
  <text start="1886.299" dur="4.021">deliverance</text>
  <text start="1887.169" dur="7.411">well my marriage was falling apart</text>
  <text start="1890.32" dur="5.97">about 15 months or so ago my husband and</text>
  <text start="1894.58" dur="7.73">I were just at the end of what we could</text>
  <text start="1896.29" dur="9.78">do and he&amp;#39;s a good man but things were</text>
  <text start="1902.31" dur="6.46">falling down pretty quickly and we had</text>
  <text start="1906.07" dur="6.06">been married for over 20 years he was</text>
  <text start="1908.77" dur="6.66">just tired of dealing with me with the</text>
  <text start="1912.13" dur="6.39">illness he was angry he was resentful he</text>
  <text start="1915.43" dur="6.45">had his own issues it was just every day</text>
  <text start="1918.52" dur="6.36">was difficult we were disagreeing almost</text>
  <text start="1921.88" dur="5.54">every waking moment you know there was</text>
  <text start="1924.88" dur="5.7">just a lot of low-level resentments on</text>
  <text start="1927.42" dur="4.72">unresolved conflicts just even talking</text>
  <text start="1930.58" dur="4.62">about simple things and dealing with the</text>
  <text start="1932.14" dur="4.65">children was difficult and I think both</text>
  <text start="1935.2" dur="4.17">of us just said kind of reached the end</text>
  <text start="1936.79" dur="3.09">of ourselves my illness had been hard on</text>
  <text start="1939.37" dur="2.31">him</text>
  <text start="1939.88" dur="4.44">there had been things that I had done</text>
  <text start="1941.68" dur="7.58">early in our marriage before I had my</text>
  <text start="1944.32" dur="7.68">diagnosis and I I was rough with him and</text>
  <text start="1949.26" dur="6.61">there was damage that was done there and</text>
  <text start="1952" dur="6.84">I was very unstable emotionally and I</text>
  <text start="1955.87" dur="4.8">think he had tried to hang in there with</text>
  <text start="1958.84" dur="4.26">me as long as he could but he had kind</text>
  <text start="1960.67" dur="6.12">of reached the end of what he wanted to</text>
  <text start="1963.1" dur="6.45">do and even though I felt I had made</text>
  <text start="1966.79" dur="5.82">meaningful progress in therapy and I had</text>
  <text start="1969.55" dur="5.1">changed and I had repented I think from</text>
  <text start="1972.61" dur="5.1">his point of view too much damage had</text>
  <text start="1974.65" dur="4.95">been done and he just he couldn&amp;#39;t he</text>
  <text start="1977.71" dur="3.87">couldn&amp;#39;t move past it he couldn&amp;#39;t move</text>
  <text start="1979.6" dur="3.39">past he couldn&amp;#39;t see moving forward yeah</text>
  <text start="1981.58" dur="2.94">with things being the way they were yeah</text>
  <text start="1982.99" dur="3.03">it was either things had to make a</text>
  <text start="1984.52" dur="5.19">dramatic change or it was going to be</text>
  <text start="1986.02" dur="5.75">over yeah so we were both kind of in</text>
  <text start="1989.71" dur="5.91">that space and in those very difficult</text>
  <text start="1991.77" dur="7.33">conversations one of my co-workers who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1995.62" dur="6.57">a very courageous man and he had been my</text>
  <text start="1999.1" dur="4.71">prayer partner for a few years as I&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="2002.19" dur="3.69">been in a difficult marriage and he had</text>
  <text start="2003.81" dur="5.16">just been very kind to me and praying</text>
  <text start="2005.88" dur="4.95">with me every so often as I needed it he</text>
  <text start="2008.97" dur="3.42">came to me one day and he knew my</text>
  <text start="2010.83" dur="3.9">situation he knew it was getting worse</text>
  <text start="2012.39" dur="5.25">and he says you know Christa have you</text>
  <text start="2014.73" dur="5.64">ever have you ever considered that maybe</text>
  <text start="2017.64" dur="4.65">the problems you and your husband have</text>
  <text start="2020.37" dur="3.63">or not really what they appear to be</text>
  <text start="2022.29" dur="4.89">that maybe there&amp;#39;s something more</text>
  <text start="2024" dur="6.09">there and I&amp;#39;m like no idea what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2027.18" dur="4.23">talking about and so then he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="2030.09" dur="2.76">well you know if you were considered</text>
  <text start="2031.41" dur="4.91">that maybe that&amp;#39;s a spiritual dimension</text>
  <text start="2032.85" dur="6.57">that you know this is a demonic</text>
  <text start="2036.32" dur="5.38">assignment to your marriage and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2039.42" dur="2.85">thinking like wait a minute that&amp;#39;s my</text>
  <text start="2041.7" dur="2.7">line</text>
  <text start="2042.27" dur="6.57">I&amp;#39;m the theologian what are we talking</text>
  <text start="2044.4" dur="5.999">about and I just didn&amp;#39;t even know I mean</text>
  <text start="2048.84" dur="4.819">of course I believed in demons I</text>
  <text start="2050.399" dur="6.661">believed in Satan I had taught</text>
  <text start="2053.659" dur="6.701">demonology and in theology classes I</text>
  <text start="2057.06" dur="6.51">mean I knew all the Bible verses but for</text>
  <text start="2060.36" dur="7.08">me it wasn&amp;#39;t a reality it wasn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="2063.57" dur="7.64">wasn&amp;#39;t experience experiencial so he</text>
  <text start="2067.44" dur="6.209">gave me the the name of a ministry to</text>
  <text start="2071.21" dur="4.81">actually what he did was he contacted</text>
  <text start="2073.649" dur="6.631">the ministry and then he just gave me</text>
  <text start="2076.02" dur="6.659">the name of the local person the local</text>
  <text start="2080.28" dur="3.96">deliverance minister now was this</text>
  <text start="2082.679" dur="4.23">freedom encounter yes it was freedom</text>
  <text start="2084.24" dur="4.56">encounters there in Idaho I will leave a</text>
  <text start="2086.909" dur="4.47">link to their website that way the</text>
  <text start="2088.8" dur="5.49">podcast notes yeah so it&amp;#39;s kenan Sylvia</text>
  <text start="2091.379" dur="4.591">Thornburg and Ken Thornburg has been</text>
  <text start="2094.29" dur="3.81">involved in deliverance for I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2095.97" dur="4.02">30 or 40 and he is a pioneer in</text>
  <text start="2098.1" dur="4.05">emotional here yeah I love his stuff</text>
  <text start="2099.99" dur="3.87">there they&amp;#39;re an amazing couple and so</text>
  <text start="2102.15" dur="3.87">they have ministers all over the world</text>
  <text start="2103.86" dur="4.32">so people don&amp;#39;t have to go to Idaho</text>
  <text start="2106.02" dur="4.65">there&amp;#39;s probably somebody in their area</text>
  <text start="2108.18" dur="6.39">that that ministers through freedom</text>
  <text start="2110.67" dur="6.66">encounters so my friend my coworker gave</text>
  <text start="2114.57" dur="5.79">me the information for the local person</text>
  <text start="2117.33" dur="4.92">here in Southern California and I just</text>
  <text start="2120.36" dur="4.26">gave it to my husband and I said look I</text>
  <text start="2122.25" dur="6.48">don&amp;#39;t know if this interests you this is</text>
  <text start="2124.62" dur="6.66">sort of a last gasp for us but if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2128.73" dur="4.83">interested in going through this prayer</text>
  <text start="2131.28" dur="5.49">ministry you know here&amp;#39;s the number</text>
  <text start="2133.56" dur="4.83">basically and ironically I just gave it</text>
  <text start="2136.77" dur="4.47">to my husband not even thinking about</text>
  <text start="2138.39" dur="5.16">myself just gave him the number and my</text>
  <text start="2141.24" dur="4.44">husband reached out to them and he</text>
  <text start="2143.55" dur="3.63">called and they have a little process</text>
  <text start="2145.68" dur="2.94">that they have you go through because</text>
  <text start="2147.18" dur="3.42">they want you to be able to keep your</text>
  <text start="2148.62" dur="4.86">deliverance when you&amp;#39;re done so you have</text>
  <text start="2150.6" dur="4.56">to go if to watch some videos some</text>
  <text start="2153.48" dur="3.72">instructional videos from the</text>
  <text start="2155.16" dur="2.64">Thornburg&amp;#39;s to understand kind of how</text>
  <text start="2157.2" dur="2.85">you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="2157.8" dur="3.72">into the situation and how what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2160.05" dur="3.06">gonna do to get you out of it and then</text>
  <text start="2161.52" dur="4.92">how you&amp;#39;re gonna walk in that keep your</text>
  <text start="2163.11" dur="7.13">deliverance and so my husband went</text>
  <text start="2166.44" dur="9.18">through that process and I saw such a</text>
  <text start="2170.24" dur="8.14">dramatic transformation in him that then</text>
  <text start="2175.62" dur="5.73">I thought I I think I want to do this</text>
  <text start="2178.38" dur="4.95">and so I went through the process a few</text>
  <text start="2181.35" dur="3.95">weeks later and and my husband and I</text>
  <text start="2183.33" dur="5.04">kind of have a standing agreement of</text>
  <text start="2185.3" dur="5.98">whatever one of us does spiritually</text>
  <text start="2188.37" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re kind of in it together and we both</text>
  <text start="2191.28" dur="5.1">do it and we&amp;#39;ve done that throughout our</text>
  <text start="2193.2" dur="6.48">marriage so I went through it and I was</text>
  <text start="2196.38" dur="5.01">not expecting like the issue of mental</text>
  <text start="2199.68" dur="4.8">illness to come up because in my mind</text>
  <text start="2201.39" dur="4.8">that was a medical problem you had not</text>
  <text start="2204.48" dur="2.28">made the connection between the two not</text>
  <text start="2206.19" dur="2.88">at all</text>
  <text start="2206.76" dur="11.49">and you&amp;#39;re probably still a little bit</text>
  <text start="2209.07" dur="12.38">in denial but I think that when I when I</text>
  <text start="2218.25" dur="7.56">got down there and in the prayer and</text>
  <text start="2221.45" dur="7.81">this starts coming out in my case the</text>
  <text start="2225.81" dur="5.67">bipolar and the attachment issues that I</text>
  <text start="2229.26" dur="4.98">struggled with since childhood and all</text>
  <text start="2231.48" dur="4.83">of these things the the anxiety the post</text>
  <text start="2234.24" dur="4.52">traumatic stress disorder that I</text>
  <text start="2236.31" dur="6.81">suffered with for years that all of that</text>
  <text start="2238.76" dur="7.09">was in some way a provocation of of the</text>
  <text start="2243.12" dur="4.95">enemies at work in my mind</text>
  <text start="2245.85" dur="4.77">okay so I&amp;#39;m gonna ask you to unpack some</text>
  <text start="2248.07" dur="4.59">of this in as much detail as you can so</text>
  <text start="2250.62" dur="3.54">they ask you to fill out a pretty</text>
  <text start="2252.66" dur="3.24">comprehensive questionnaire didn&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="2254.16" dur="4.83">before you went in no it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="2255.9" dur="6.21">one-page checklist okay yeah and so you</text>
  <text start="2258.99" dur="4.71">just go in there and the way that</text>
  <text start="2262.11" dur="3.72">freedom encounters does things is you</text>
  <text start="2263.7" dur="3.72">don&amp;#39;t you don&amp;#39;t need to give a lot of</text>
  <text start="2265.83" dur="3.69">backstory because their philosophy is</text>
  <text start="2267.42" dur="3.99">the Holy Spirit knows everything so they</text>
  <text start="2269.52" dur="4.2">do spirit-led things whatever the Holy</text>
  <text start="2271.41" dur="6.03">Spirit reveals they cut those things and</text>
  <text start="2273.72" dur="6.33">that there&amp;#39;s two parts to the prayer</text>
  <text start="2277.44" dur="5.46">ministry the first part the first day is</text>
  <text start="2280.05" dur="4.77">what I call the casting out it&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2282.9" dur="5.07">casting out of the demons and then the</text>
  <text start="2284.82" dur="5.22">second day is the Holy Spirit kind of</text>
  <text start="2287.97" dur="3.36">ministering to you and beginning to heal</text>
  <text start="2290.04" dur="4.08">you and fill</text>
  <text start="2291.33" dur="5.34">all of those broken places and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2294.12" dur="4.05">kind of the inner healing component okay</text>
  <text start="2296.67" dur="5.93">so you got down there</text>
  <text start="2298.17" dur="7.23">yeah and it was casting out day yeah so</text>
  <text start="2302.6" dur="5.17">not knowing what was going to come out</text>
  <text start="2305.4" dur="5.19">not knowing what was going to be there</text>
  <text start="2307.77" dur="4.62">just so your your listeners understand</text>
  <text start="2310.59" dur="4.44">their the the approach of freedom</text>
  <text start="2312.39" dur="4.83">encounters is to address only the head</text>
  <text start="2315.03" dur="5.4">demon they&amp;#39;re only talking to one demon</text>
  <text start="2317.22" dur="5.7">okay and their approach is that the</text>
  <text start="2320.43" dur="4.47">demonic realm works kind of like an army</text>
  <text start="2322.92" dur="5.34">so they&amp;#39;re going to go for the general</text>
  <text start="2324.9" dur="5.88">and all of the other soldiers will fall</text>
  <text start="2328.26" dur="5.58">in line and do whatever that general</text>
  <text start="2330.78" dur="5.25">does and follow him so their approach is</text>
  <text start="2333.84" dur="7.23">that they just approach and talk to the</text>
  <text start="2336.03" dur="6.57">head demon and you as and this is not I</text>
  <text start="2341.07" dur="4.71">don&amp;#39;t want people to have like visions</text>
  <text start="2342.6" dur="5.28">of the Hollywood Exorcist you know my</text>
  <text start="2345.78" dur="3.78">voice didn&amp;#39;t change or my head didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2347.88" dur="5.36">spin backward or anything like that it</text>
  <text start="2349.56" dur="5.88">was just me reporting the thoughts that</text>
  <text start="2353.24" dur="4.48">were brought to my mind</text>
  <text start="2355.44" dur="5.04">so as the deliverance minister would</text>
  <text start="2357.72" dur="6.36">speak to the head demon then I would</text>
  <text start="2360.48" dur="7.74">report what was being said or the</text>
  <text start="2364.08" dur="6.69">thoughts in my mind so the you know many</text>
  <text start="2368.22" dur="4.59">of the the reports in the beginning were</text>
  <text start="2370.77" dur="4.98">designed to get me to be skeptical of</text>
  <text start="2372.81" dur="6.3">the process you know this isn&amp;#39;t going to</text>
  <text start="2375.75" dur="6">work I don&amp;#39;t have to do what you say she</text>
  <text start="2379.11" dur="5.04">belongs to me there were some curse</text>
  <text start="2381.75" dur="5.55">words in there that we won&amp;#39;t repeat but</text>
  <text start="2384.15" dur="5.16">it was a lot of sort of defiant reports</text>
  <text start="2387.3" dur="4.68">and so I&amp;#39;m just reporting what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2389.31" dur="5.25">hearing in my mind and I&amp;#39;m thinking this</text>
  <text start="2391.98" dur="4.17">is crazy you know so there&amp;#39;s like my own</text>
  <text start="2394.56" dur="4.17">thoughts that are happening over here as</text>
  <text start="2396.15" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;m the theologian who&amp;#39;s analyzing this</text>
  <text start="2398.73" dur="3.3">and trying to make sense of what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2399.99" dur="4.95">happening and then there&amp;#39;s the demonic</text>
  <text start="2402.03" dur="4.5">thought of answering the the question</text>
  <text start="2404.94" dur="3.57">was that the first time where you</text>
  <text start="2406.53" dur="3.84">actually realized that there are some</text>
  <text start="2408.51" dur="5.64">other voices I&amp;#39;m hearing that are</text>
  <text start="2410.37" dur="6.27">definitely not mine yes that was quite a</text>
  <text start="2414.15" dur="4.68">revelation for me because I I think I</text>
  <text start="2416.64" dur="5.28">went into it like okay I&amp;#39;m open to this</text>
  <text start="2418.83" dur="4.53">I want to have an open mind but there</text>
  <text start="2421.92" dur="3.36">was a part of me that was still very</text>
  <text start="2423.36" dur="4.68">skeptical that</text>
  <text start="2425.28" dur="6.93">that I had any problems well look you</text>
  <text start="2428.04" dur="6.27">were taught yeah and you taught in your</text>
  <text start="2432.21" dur="3.6">theology classes you probably taught</text>
  <text start="2434.31" dur="3.54">that Christians can&amp;#39;t have demons I</text>
  <text start="2435.81" dur="6.3">don&amp;#39;t know if I ever taught that but I</text>
  <text start="2437.85" dur="6.21">think that I kind of thought that I I</text>
  <text start="2442.11" dur="3.42">don&amp;#39;t think I had really given it much</text>
  <text start="2444.06" dur="4.56">thought but that was my general</text>
  <text start="2445.53" dur="4.35">operating assumption and and where I had</text>
  <text start="2448.62" dur="3.51">come from and I&amp;#39;m not even really sure</text>
  <text start="2449.88" dur="3.93">where I got that idea but yeah I think</text>
  <text start="2452.13" dur="5.16">that was probably my operating</text>
  <text start="2453.81" dur="5.37">assumption one thing that was that was</text>
  <text start="2457.29" dur="3.78">actually very helpful to me and this</text>
  <text start="2459.18" dur="3.6">will help your listeners who are not</text>
  <text start="2461.07" dur="4.23">charismatic who are more like coming</text>
  <text start="2462.78" dur="5.4">from the background that I had is I read</text>
  <text start="2465.3" dur="4.59">a very helpful book a few months before</text>
  <text start="2468.18" dur="4.23">I went through deliverance before I</text>
  <text start="2469.89" dur="5.01">deliverance was even on my radar the</text>
  <text start="2472.41" dur="5.85">Lord brought me past a book called</text>
  <text start="2474.9" dur="5.94">spiritual warfare by Carl Payne and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2478.26" dur="4.95">a deliverance minister in Seattle but he</text>
  <text start="2480.84" dur="4.2">comes from the same flow of Christianity</text>
  <text start="2483.21" dur="5.04">than I do which is as a conservative</text>
  <text start="2485.04" dur="7.53">Baptist and I have found his book to be</text>
  <text start="2488.25" dur="6.36">very useful with non-charismatic s-- no</text>
  <text start="2492.57" dur="4.89">I have a question yeah if I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2494.61" dur="4.44">mistaken he is the chaplain for the</text>
  <text start="2497.46" dur="3.21">Seattle Seahawks correct yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="2499.05" dur="3.72">yeah I&amp;#39;ve actually downloaded his book</text>
  <text start="2500.67" dur="4.23">and I read it yeah I didn&amp;#39;t find it very</text>
  <text start="2502.77" dur="5.25">helpful because I come from a</text>
  <text start="2504.9" dur="5.7">charismatic background I found that book</text>
  <text start="2508.02" dur="6.24">incredibly useful because it opened up</text>
  <text start="2510.6" dur="6.03">that realm up for me in a way that spoke</text>
  <text start="2514.26" dur="4.23">my language and made sense to me I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2516.63" dur="4.47">think I ever would have gone down this</text>
  <text start="2518.49" dur="4.86">path if I had an encounter Carl Payne&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2521.1" dur="4.77">book in the first place and that that</text>
  <text start="2523.35" dur="4.38">book probably couched the discussion in</text>
  <text start="2525.87" dur="4.53">in a way you could receive it because</text>
  <text start="2527.73" dur="4.89">he&amp;#39;s a theologian - yes yeah so it was</text>
  <text start="2530.4" dur="3.66">that was kind of a first step for me</text>
  <text start="2532.62" dur="3.36">then I went through the deliverance and</text>
  <text start="2534.06" dur="3.81">then when I&amp;#39;m down there you know they</text>
  <text start="2535.98" dur="4.23">go through this prayer and and the way</text>
  <text start="2537.87" dur="5.25">that the freedom encounters does the</text>
  <text start="2540.21" dur="5.64">prayer is it&amp;#39;s fairly structured but</text>
  <text start="2543.12" dur="5.76">they do kind of have an interrogation of</text>
  <text start="2545.85" dur="4.62">the head demon so think of it as I love</text>
  <text start="2548.88" dur="4.44">it they interrogate the head demon oh</text>
  <text start="2550.47" dur="4.89">yes I think there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="2553.32" dur="3.75">ministries that do not like to</text>
  <text start="2555.36" dur="3.759">interrogate demons because they think</text>
  <text start="2557.07" dur="5.32">well all demons are going to do is life</text>
  <text start="2559.119" dur="4.801">well that&amp;#39;s not true yeah demons can lie</text>
  <text start="2562.39" dur="3.149">to you but some the information they</text>
  <text start="2563.92" dur="3.689">give is true and some of it is very</text>
  <text start="2565.539" dur="6.57">helpful it is very helpful think of it</text>
  <text start="2567.609" dur="7.051">as like you&amp;#39;ve captured the general in a</text>
  <text start="2572.109" dur="5.4">war and you bring them in to the</text>
  <text start="2574.66" dur="5.699">interrogation room and you&amp;#39;ve got the</text>
  <text start="2577.509" dur="4.56">head of the CIA or the FBI</text>
  <text start="2580.359" dur="3.781">you know they got them under the light</text>
  <text start="2582.069" dur="4.05">and you know they&amp;#39;re asking them the</text>
  <text start="2584.14" dur="4.229">questions they want to know hey what was</text>
  <text start="2586.119" dur="4.14">your strategy what were you trying to do</text>
  <text start="2588.369" dur="3.87">in this person&amp;#39;s life how are you</text>
  <text start="2590.259" dur="5.641">working out and they asked very specific</text>
  <text start="2592.239" dur="6.451">questions to get at that and think of it</text>
  <text start="2595.9" dur="5.01">as a courtroom where the holy spirit is</text>
  <text start="2598.69" dur="4.71">forcing that demon to tell the truth</text>
  <text start="2600.91" dur="5.22">right so let me ask you this when they</text>
  <text start="2603.4" dur="4.8">were asking the questions did you hear</text>
  <text start="2606.13" dur="3.54">the demon talking or did the demon talk</text>
  <text start="2608.2" dur="3.359">through you because sometimes it happens</text>
  <text start="2609.67" dur="3.54">both ways some people the demon actually</text>
  <text start="2611.559" dur="3.42">speaks through them and sometimes the</text>
  <text start="2613.21" dur="4.259">person hears the demonic voice and says</text>
  <text start="2614.979" dur="5.161">with whatever they I was just reporting</text>
  <text start="2617.469" dur="4.921">the thought of what I was hearing in my</text>
  <text start="2620.14" dur="4.139">so he had minimal control of your</text>
  <text start="2622.39" dur="3.869">physical body I think there were some</text>
  <text start="2624.279" dur="3.75">things that he had physical control over</text>
  <text start="2626.259" dur="4.921">were you doing things involuntarily</text>
  <text start="2628.029" dur="5.75">there were there were some things I</text>
  <text start="2631.18" dur="6.389">definitely struggled with okay yeah yeah</text>
  <text start="2633.779" dur="6.31">towards the end my medication stopped</text>
  <text start="2637.569" dur="6.061">working toward the end even though I was</text>
  <text start="2640.089" dur="5.43">still taking it it was like I told my</text>
  <text start="2643.63" dur="4.619">husband in the three weeks before my</text>
  <text start="2645.519" dur="6">prayer I said it&amp;#39;s almost like I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2648.249" dur="5.451">taking my medicine but I am but I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2651.519" dur="6.51">experiencing all the symptoms I had</text>
  <text start="2653.7" dur="7.029">before I started and so it was like they</text>
  <text start="2658.029" dur="6.171">were they were scared they already knew</text>
  <text start="2660.729" dur="6">that they were about to be homeless and</text>
  <text start="2664.2" dur="4.75">they ratcheted up the exit exactly</text>
  <text start="2666.729" dur="5.691">that&amp;#39;s really common with that I found</text>
  <text start="2668.95" dur="6.839">with demons is as they start to</text>
  <text start="2672.42" dur="5.23">understand that their time is short they</text>
  <text start="2675.789" dur="3.841">start to create all kinds of havoc</text>
  <text start="2677.65" dur="4.409">trying trying to scare you trying to</text>
  <text start="2679.63" dur="4.649">frighten you just stop the car anything</text>
  <text start="2682.059" dur="6.48">right up to get you to stop going down</text>
  <text start="2684.279" dur="6.661">this path of freedom so the prayer took</text>
  <text start="2688.539" dur="4.411">quite a long time it was four or five</text>
  <text start="2690.94" dur="5.73">hours there was a lot to and</text>
  <text start="2692.95" dur="5.399">but the plan that came forward was we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2696.67" dur="4.11">put this in place with the mental</text>
  <text start="2698.349" dur="5.611">illness the anxiety disorder that the</text>
  <text start="2700.78" dur="7.079">trauma we&amp;#39;ve set abusive people into her</text>
  <text start="2703.96" dur="6.75">life to abuse her you know and so this</text>
  <text start="2707.859" dur="5.451">was the plan as they had been unfolding</text>
  <text start="2710.71" dur="5.67">it almost from the beginning of my life</text>
  <text start="2713.31" dur="6.16">this is gonna be a little bit of a shock</text>
  <text start="2716.38" dur="4.709">to some people okay but a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2719.47" dur="4.23">don&amp;#39;t understand that demons actually</text>
  <text start="2721.089" dur="5.52">colabor with each other to draw certain</text>
  <text start="2723.7" dur="5.22">people together who are dysfunctional to</text>
  <text start="2726.609" dur="5.72">just create more turmoil and more</text>
  <text start="2728.92" dur="7.53">problems I&amp;#39;m absolutely convinced that</text>
  <text start="2732.329" dur="5.981">as much as Jesus loves children to that</text>
  <text start="2736.45" dur="4.649">degree demons will do everything they</text>
  <text start="2738.31" dur="5.13">can to send abusive people into a</text>
  <text start="2741.099" dur="5.73">child&amp;#39;s life right with purpose with</text>
  <text start="2743.44" dur="5.429">intention to screw that child up and I</text>
  <text start="2746.829" dur="3.691">think that they they collaborate quite a</text>
  <text start="2748.869" dur="4.23">bit in the experience that I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="2750.52" dur="4.559">since my own deliverance in working and</text>
  <text start="2753.099" dur="3.631">ministering to other people to help them</text>
  <text start="2755.079" dur="4.951">get free I just see that as a pattern</text>
  <text start="2756.73" dur="6.359">over and over again yep get him when</text>
  <text start="2760.03" dur="4.53">they&amp;#39;re young yeah so in comparison to</text>
  <text start="2763.089" dur="3.421">other people that go through freedom</text>
  <text start="2764.56" dur="4.44">encounters you know on average a prayer</text>
  <text start="2766.51" dur="8.52">might be about two hours mine was about</text>
  <text start="2769" dur="9.45">five hours I had a lot of you know drove</text>
  <text start="2775.03" dur="5.64">home that night and I had a lot of</text>
  <text start="2778.45" dur="4.649">doubts I had still a lot of thoughts of</text>
  <text start="2780.67" dur="4.56">like nothing happened I don&amp;#39;t get okay</text>
  <text start="2783.099" dur="4.47">so hang on did they can&amp;#39;t did you did</text>
  <text start="2785.23" dur="6.66">they like get rid of the head demon and</text>
  <text start="2787.569" dur="7.321">did you sensed it leaving yes and other</text>
  <text start="2791.89" dur="4.679">demons went with it did you feel any</text>
  <text start="2794.89" dur="3.75">physically or emotionally spiritually</text>
  <text start="2796.569" dur="5.221">did you feel any different when this</text>
  <text start="2798.64" dur="6.66">session was done um my husband in his</text>
  <text start="2801.79" dur="5.85">session noticed it right away he was he</text>
  <text start="2805.3" dur="6.529">for him when they did the casting out</text>
  <text start="2807.64" dur="8.85">the relief was immediate he noticed that</text>
  <text start="2811.829" dur="7.78">he just felt lighter freer his his mind</text>
  <text start="2816.49" dur="6.96">wasn&amp;#39;t as cluttered he noticed an</text>
  <text start="2819.609" dur="5.73">immediate release for me it was it</text>
  <text start="2823.45" dur="3.42">wasn&amp;#39;t until really the next morning</text>
  <text start="2825.339" dur="4.021">when I woke up</text>
  <text start="2826.87" dur="5.16">and it was the first morning that I ever</text>
  <text start="2829.36" dur="5.16">woke up in my conscious life and I</text>
  <text start="2832.03" dur="5.43">didn&amp;#39;t want to die I didn&amp;#39;t have a death</text>
  <text start="2834.52" dur="5.46">what I call a death message where okay</text>
  <text start="2837.46" dur="3.81">because every morning I would wake up in</text>
  <text start="2839.98" dur="3.66">the very first thought I would have</text>
  <text start="2841.27" dur="5.82">every day is today&amp;#39;s a good day to die</text>
  <text start="2843.64" dur="4.35">or I want to die today something along</text>
  <text start="2847.09" dur="3.36">those lines</text>
  <text start="2847.99" dur="4.92">was my first thought is when I opened my</text>
  <text start="2850.45" dur="4.95">eyes in the morning and when I woke up</text>
  <text start="2852.91" dur="5.25">that next morning and I didn&amp;#39;t have one</text>
  <text start="2855.4" dur="6.27">of those death messages I was like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2858.16" dur="8.16">free it&amp;#39;s over and that was really my</text>
  <text start="2861.67" dur="7.55">first kind of I think something really</text>
  <text start="2866.32" dur="7.98">happened did you notice the lack of</text>
  <text start="2869.22" dur="9.85">voices yeah silence yeah and then was it</text>
  <text start="2874.3" dur="8.19">uncomfortable um only for a few days but</text>
  <text start="2879.07" dur="5.61">I I can hardly remember it now yeah I</text>
  <text start="2882.49" dur="4.86">talked to a woman who went through</text>
  <text start="2884.68" dur="4.92">deliverance and she had been so used to</text>
  <text start="2887.35" dur="4.11">the voices talking to her that after she</text>
  <text start="2889.6" dur="5.33">got set free and after the demons left</text>
  <text start="2891.46" dur="7.02">and there was this really unusual</text>
  <text start="2894.93" dur="6.22">silence in her mind she couldn&amp;#39;t take it</text>
  <text start="2898.48" dur="5.79">and she invited the demons back and that</text>
  <text start="2901.15" dur="5.04">does happen for some people and I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="2904.27" dur="5.01">sure I understand enough about it yet</text>
  <text start="2906.19" dur="6.27">why that happens for some people but for</text>
  <text start="2909.28" dur="6.63">me it was I think the only uncomfortable</text>
  <text start="2912.46" dur="7.17">part was I finally believed I was gonna</text>
  <text start="2915.91" dur="6.15">live and so now I had to figure out how</text>
  <text start="2919.63" dur="5.55">to live because my whole life I had</text>
  <text start="2922.06" dur="6.54">spent most of my energy trying not to</text>
  <text start="2925.18" dur="5.82">die trying desperately just to survive</text>
  <text start="2928.6" dur="3.6">and now for you survival is a given and</text>
  <text start="2931" dur="4.11">now you have to figure out what am I</text>
  <text start="2932.2" dur="5.19">going to do yeah so that was the</text>
  <text start="2935.11" dur="4.32">uncomfortable part of it for me is that</text>
  <text start="2937.39" dur="3.45">when I had that thought it was a few</text>
  <text start="2939.43" dur="3.15">days after my deliverance and I remember</text>
  <text start="2940.84" dur="5.85">texting my deliverance minister was like</text>
  <text start="2942.58" dur="6.3">now I have to live wow that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2946.69" dur="4.86">totally new thought I&amp;#39;ve never had that</text>
  <text start="2948.88" dur="3.63">thought before so yeah we have to make</text>
  <text start="2951.55" dur="4.65">plans for the future</text>
  <text start="2952.51" dur="7.08">actly yeah so you fairly quickly went</text>
  <text start="2956.2" dur="4.319">into telling other people no what</text>
  <text start="2959.59" dur="7.09">happened I did not</text>
  <text start="2960.519" dur="11.05">I told eight people right I told my</text>
  <text start="2966.68" dur="7.2">eight closest friends and even then it</text>
  <text start="2971.569" dur="4.05">took me about a week before I told them</text>
  <text start="2973.88" dur="3.84">and then I just kind of sent them all a</text>
  <text start="2975.619" dur="3.301">note and said hey I want to play you</text>
  <text start="2977.72" dur="2.94">know what&amp;#39;s been going on because these</text>
  <text start="2978.92" dur="4.02">are people that have been on this</text>
  <text start="2980.66" dur="7.379">journey with me for some of them for</text>
  <text start="2982.94" dur="9.72">decades they knew me as a child and so I</text>
  <text start="2988.039" dur="8.78">didn&amp;#39;t come out to kind of my next</text>
  <text start="2992.66" dur="7.31">circle of friends for nine months and</text>
  <text start="2996.819" dur="6.52">then I didn&amp;#39;t really come out publicly</text>
  <text start="2999.97" dur="5.829">until I had been free for almost a year</text>
  <text start="3003.339" dur="6.091">because I really wanted to have kind of</text>
  <text start="3005.799" dur="5.22">some medical verification of one</text>
  <text start="3009.43" dur="4.26">concerned that people would be skeptical</text>
  <text start="3011.019" dur="4.141">oh yeah your claims oh yeah because I</text>
  <text start="3013.69" dur="4.29">mean let&amp;#39;s think about in a minute</text>
  <text start="3015.16" dur="4.74">mental illness bipolar and demons I mean</text>
  <text start="3017.98" dur="4.049">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s like the you know the</text>
  <text start="3019.9" dur="4.23">trifecta of hey you know maybe you</text>
  <text start="3022.029" dur="6.99">should have got off your medication that</text>
  <text start="3024.13" dur="8.3">would be a good title for a book I</text>
  <text start="3029.019" dur="6.99">wanted to be very careful in how I</text>
  <text start="3032.43" dur="5.589">presented it and I did a presentation in</text>
  <text start="3036.009" dur="5.61">my Sunday School class at church and</text>
  <text start="3038.019" dur="6.99">that was really kind of my first step of</text>
  <text start="3041.619" dur="6">faith of presenting it and I presented</text>
  <text start="3045.009" dur="4.681">it to a group of non-charismatic s&amp;#39; at</text>
  <text start="3047.619" dur="3.571">my church and these are people some of</text>
  <text start="3049.69" dur="3.389">them were my Sunday School teachers when</text>

  <text start="3053.079" dur="4.71">same church I went to as a child and I</text>
  <text start="3056.049" dur="6.421">thought if I could come out to these</text>

  <text start="3111.07" dur="5.19">for two decades just specifically in</text>
  <text start="3114.07" dur="5.82">science apologetics for going on 17</text>
  <text start="3116.26" dur="7.2">years I work with a team of research</text>

  <text start="3197.26" dur="5.52">I used to use being bipolar and having a</text>

  <text start="3245.839" dur="4.98">have Asperger&amp;#39;s are aware of and I asked</text>
  <text start="3248.21" dur="4.289">her one day I said if God wanted to heal</text>
  <text start="3250.819" dur="3.75">you of Asperger&amp;#39;s would you want to be</text>
  <text start="3252.499" dur="5.61">healed and her first response to me was</text>
  <text start="3254.569" dur="7.141">no because she felt that Asperger&amp;#39;s gave</text>
  <text start="3258.109" dur="5.25">her some kind of advantage in life that</text>
  <text start="3261.71" dur="3.659">other people didn&amp;#39;t have it made her</text>
  <text start="3263.359" dur="4.801">smarter it made her gave her other</text>

  <text start="3268.16" dur="4.169">wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be healed but then as</text>
  <text start="3270.079" dur="5.341">we talked about it over the next week or</text>
  <text start="3272.329" dur="4.47">so I said you know when God heals you he</text>
  <text start="3275.42" dur="4.319">doesn&amp;#39;t take away anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3276.799" dur="5.49">positive from you he only fixes what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3279.739" dur="4.35">broken and what&amp;#39;s negative and if you</text>
  <text start="3282.289" dur="4.74">want to be healed I think he will heal</text>
  <text start="3284.089" dur="6">you and you can maintain the uniqueness</text>
  <text start="3287.029" dur="5.73">without you know losing what you like</text>
  <text start="3290.089" dur="5.101">about your personality and I would kind</text>
  <text start="3292.759" dur="4.681">of agree with that I think that my boss</text>
  <text start="3295.19" dur="3.51">has Asperger&amp;#39;s the founder of the</text>
  <text start="3297.44" dur="4.829">ministry that I work for he has</text>
  <text start="3298.7" dur="6.629">Asperger&amp;#39;s and I know that it has played</text>
  <text start="3302.269" dur="6">a huge role in his ability to think in</text>

  <text start="3311.39" dur="4.229">the rest of us we&amp;#39;re not really so sure</text>
  <text start="3313.039" dur="5.19">there&amp;#39;s a connection there and sure</text>
  <text start="3315.619" dur="5.13">enough 10 or 20 years later research</text>
  <text start="3318.229" dur="5.1">comes around to his way of thinking so</text>
  <text start="3320.749" dur="5.431">it is interesting but I would I would</text>
  <text start="3323.329" dur="6.03">qualify that I don&amp;#39;t view as Burgers as</text>
  <text start="3326.18" dur="5.879">being a mental illness it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s I view</text>
  <text start="3329.359" dur="4.291">it as being like kind of neurodiversity</text>
  <text start="3332.059" dur="3.93">or you know it&amp;#39;s a different</text>
  <text start="3333.65" dur="3.899">neurological functioning but that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3335.989" dur="3.48">to say that God can&amp;#39;t heal that because</text>
  <text start="3337.549" dur="3.72">I definitely think that you know there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3339.469" dur="3.991">something there that could be looked at</text>
  <text start="3341.269" dur="5.641">in a healing context but I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="3343.46" dur="6.629">careful to not put mental illness and</text>
  <text start="3346.91" dur="4.709">Asperger&amp;#39;s in the same they&amp;#39;re apples</text>
  <text start="3350.089" dur="3.96">yeah they&amp;#39;re a little different but I</text>
  <text start="3351.619" dur="6.45">think that what I&amp;#39;ve learned in the last</text>
  <text start="3354.049" dur="6.601">15 months is that working now filled</text>
  <text start="3358.069" dur="3.511">with the Holy Spirit and being able to</text>
  <text start="3360.65" dur="4.17">think more clearly</text>
  <text start="3361.58" dur="6.27">I work way better than I ever did in my</text>
  <text start="3364.82" dur="6.18">best manic episode I get better ideas</text>
  <text start="3367.85" dur="5.94">now the Holy Spirit I just when I&amp;#39;m at</text>
  <text start="3371" dur="4.98">work and I need help I&amp;#39;m constantly in a</text>
  <text start="3373.79" dur="3.84">conversation with the Holy Spirit of you</text>
  <text start="3375.98" dur="3.96">know how can I handle this or what&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="3377.63" dur="5.1">what&amp;#39;s an idea I can do to a solution</text>
  <text start="3379.94" dur="5.64">for this situation and I totally</text>
  <text start="3382.73" dur="5.4">attribute that to that my calm mind that</text>
  <text start="3385.58" dur="4.5">I have now and that I can really hear</text>
  <text start="3388.13" dur="4.92">the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s voice now so much more</text>
  <text start="3390.08" dur="4.53">clearly I can tune into it whereas</text>
  <text start="3393.05" dur="4.71">before when I would have a manic episode</text>
  <text start="3394.61" dur="4.35">I might have a hundred ideas but they</text>
  <text start="3397.76" dur="3.09">would always be going in all these</text>
  <text start="3398.96" dur="4.59">different directions and it was really</text>
  <text start="3400.85" dur="4.56">hard to discipline my thoughts now if I</text>
  <text start="3403.55" dur="3.33">just stop and I pray and I asked the</text>
  <text start="3405.41" dur="4.29">Holy Spirit for direction</text>
  <text start="3406.88" dur="4.5">I find that my my ideas are actually of</text>
  <text start="3409.7" dur="4.68">a higher quality and they&amp;#39;re more</text>
  <text start="3411.38" dur="4.95">organized and so I&amp;#39;ve there&amp;#39;s definitely</text>
  <text start="3414.38" dur="4.95">been a shift and some changes there but</text>
  <text start="3416.33" dur="5.31">I&amp;#39;ve learned to appreciate that having</text>
  <text start="3419.33" dur="5.31">the Holy Spirit is way better than the</text>
  <text start="3421.64" dur="5.73">the best most epic mathematic episodes</text>
  <text start="3424.64" dur="4.98">that I ever had yeah I can only imagine</text>
  <text start="3427.37" dur="4.98">the difference in that now you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3429.62" dur="6.03">giving any headspace to all the demonic</text>
  <text start="3432.35" dur="5.52">voices and the chatter and and the all</text>
  <text start="3435.65" dur="4.29">the noise that they create that</text>
  <text start="3437.87" dur="4.59">distracts you and causes you to lose</text>
  <text start="3439.94" dur="5.31">focus and all that yeah it&amp;#39;s got to be</text>
  <text start="3442.46" dur="4.74">just amazing yeah and I feel like I can</text>
  <text start="3445.25" dur="3.84">love my co-workers better because</text>
  <text start="3447.2" dur="5.31">there&amp;#39;s more space for them whereas</text>
  <text start="3449.09" dur="6.21">before I was just very difficult to work</text>
  <text start="3452.51" dur="5.25">with because I I had so many ideas part</text>
  <text start="3455.3" dur="4.8">of my the way my bipolar would manifest</text>
  <text start="3457.76" dur="4.05">is I would have this idea this day and</text>
  <text start="3460.1" dur="3.27">then this idea the next day and then a</text>
  <text start="3461.81" dur="2.48">week later I&amp;#39;d want to change this</text>
  <text start="3463.37" dur="4.68">direction</text>
  <text start="3464.29" dur="6.91">driving them crazy so much better now</text>
  <text start="3468.05" dur="5.22">that&amp;#39;s cool so if you could give advice</text>
  <text start="3471.2" dur="5.1">to someone who suffers from depression</text>
  <text start="3473.27" dur="5.4">or bipolar what would you tell them well</text>
  <text start="3476.3" dur="4.26">the first thing I tell them is get some</text>
  <text start="3478.67" dur="3.93">professional help make a commitment to</text>
  <text start="3480.56" dur="4.53">go into therapy make a commitment to</text>
  <text start="3482.6" dur="4.83">seeing a psychiatrist and try to get</text>
  <text start="3485.09" dur="4.38">stabilized I think that we make better</text>
  <text start="3487.43" dur="4.53">decisions when we&amp;#39;re stabilized and I</text>
  <text start="3489.47" dur="4.56">think that people can get genuine relief</text>
  <text start="3491.96" dur="3.3">we live in a wonderful age of modern</text>
  <text start="3494.03" dur="3.57">medicine and</text>
  <text start="3495.26" dur="4.41">we ought to give that a shot you know</text>
  <text start="3497.6" dur="3.99">and get stabilized because there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="3499.67" dur="3.48">of people I interact with they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="3501.59" dur="3.42">in such chaos from their mental illness</text>
  <text start="3503.15" dur="3.45">that Darien they can&amp;#39;t even think</text>
  <text start="3505.01" dur="6.03">straight and they can&amp;#39;t make sound</text>
  <text start="3506.6" dur="6.72">decisions and so if a person has tried a</text>
  <text start="3511.04" dur="4.319">therapist and it hasn&amp;#39;t helped them find</text>
  <text start="3513.32" dur="3.48">a different one I would say try it if</text>
  <text start="3515.359" dur="2.76">they&amp;#39;ve tried a medication it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="3516.8" dur="2.43">working try to find a different way</text>
  <text start="3518.119" dur="2.341">because there are a lot of different</text>
  <text start="3519.23" dur="3.45">medications there&amp;#39;s a lot of options</text>
  <text start="3520.46" dur="4.71">these days and if you don&amp;#39;t feel like</text>
  <text start="3522.68" dur="4.26">your medical practitioner is listening</text>
  <text start="3525.17" dur="4.949">to you get a different one and</text>
  <text start="3526.94" dur="5.52">definitely do not get psychotropic</text>
  <text start="3530.119" dur="5.071">medication from your general</text>
  <text start="3532.46" dur="5.31">practitioner go see a psychiatrist it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3535.19" dur="4.05">oh that&amp;#39;s interesting because a lot of</text>
  <text start="3537.77" dur="3.75">the people that I know who are getting</text>
  <text start="3539.24" dur="3.69">medications for depression they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="3541.52" dur="2.94">getting it through their GP and they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3542.93" dur="3.51">never actually seen a second I would not</text>
  <text start="3544.46" dur="5.1">recommend that because there&amp;#39;s more new</text>
  <text start="3546.44" dur="4.919">GPS don&amp;#39;t know how to properly diagnose</text>
  <text start="3549.56" dur="3">for mental illness it&amp;#39;s I always</text>
  <text start="3551.359" dur="3.721">recommend to people go see a</text>
  <text start="3552.56" dur="6.09">psychiatrist first get a proper intake</text>
  <text start="3555.08" dur="6.93">get a proper diagnosis to see if there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3558.65" dur="4.98">conflicting conditions or other things</text>
  <text start="3562.01" dur="3.39">that you need to be made aware of and if</text>
  <text start="3563.63" dur="3.72">you&amp;#39;re going to go to therapy I always</text>
  <text start="3565.4" dur="4.2">tell people make a two-year commitment</text>
  <text start="3567.35" dur="4.29">to go into therapy every week because if</text>
  <text start="3569.6" dur="3.63">you just go to therapy for a few weeks</text>
  <text start="3571.64" dur="3.45">and then I commonly hear like oh it</text>
  <text start="3573.23" dur="4.139">didn&amp;#39;t work for me well how long did you</text>
  <text start="3575.09" dur="4.65">go well we went for four weeks six weeks</text>
  <text start="3577.369" dur="5.071">whatever it it doesn&amp;#39;t work like that</text>
  <text start="3579.74" dur="5.129">therapy is not magic it&amp;#39;s whatever you</text>
  <text start="3582.44" dur="4.62">bring into it whatever you put into it</text>
  <text start="3584.869" dur="4.531">whatever truth you&amp;#39;re willing to look at</text>
  <text start="3587.06" dur="3.51">about yourself is how much you&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="3589.4" dur="3.42">to grow and how much you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="3590.57" dur="4.26">benefit from it and I always tell people</text>
  <text start="3592.82" dur="4.11">if you&amp;#39;re going to go to therapy make a</text>
  <text start="3594.83" dur="5.31">two-year commitment and go once a week</text>
  <text start="3596.93" dur="5.76">and you&amp;#39;re gonna make huge progress in</text>
  <text start="3600.14" dur="5.03">two years and that&amp;#39;s really about how</text>
  <text start="3602.69" dur="5.31">long it takes for therapy to begin to</text>
  <text start="3605.17" dur="5.59">quote unquote work it&amp;#39;s a big commitment</text>
  <text start="3608" dur="5.13">but I find over and over again that</text>
  <text start="3610.76" dur="4.26">people that have taken that advice they</text>
  <text start="3613.13" dur="3.45">they make the most progress and they get</text>
  <text start="3615.02" dur="4.2">the most stable so what about</text>
  <text start="3616.58" dur="5.19">deliverance at inner healing yeah so if</text>
  <text start="3619.22" dur="4.08">people are at a place where they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3621.77" dur="3.75">noticing that medications are not</text>
  <text start="3623.3" dur="5.85">working for them for example there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3625.52" dur="6.509">situation with a gentleman I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="3629.15" dur="6.959">ministry to where he&amp;#39;s been on literally</text>
  <text start="3632.029" dur="5.78">at least 30 medication changes and it</text>
  <text start="3636.109" dur="4.861">consistently just doesn&amp;#39;t work for him</text>
  <text start="3637.809" dur="6.76">that&amp;#39;s a good indication to me that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3640.97" dur="5.579">probably time to consider some some good</text>
  <text start="3644.569" dur="4.321">deliverance you know that maybe there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3646.549" dur="5.76">there&amp;#39;s some some other demonic things</text>
  <text start="3648.89" dur="6.09">in play so if your God medication it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3652.309" dur="4.351">not working that&amp;#39;s a great time to begin</text>
  <text start="3654.98" dur="4.74">to press in for deliverance and inner</text>
  <text start="3656.66" dur="5.369">healing I think that inner healing in</text>
  <text start="3659.72" dur="4.8">deliverance actually is something that</text>
  <text start="3662.029" dur="5.28">is available to anybody who struggles</text>
  <text start="3664.52" dur="4.259">with mental illness and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="3667.309" dur="5.071">and it&amp;#39;s available if people want to</text>
  <text start="3668.779" dur="5.221">press in for it but I also know that not</text>
  <text start="3672.38" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who don&amp;#39;t feel</text>
  <text start="3674" dur="3.72">comfortable with thinking that their</text>
  <text start="3675.71" dur="4.68">mental illness is a result of demonic</text>
  <text start="3677.72" dur="4.71">activity and I&amp;#39;ve been in a lot of those</text>
  <text start="3680.39" dur="3.84">conversations where they don&amp;#39;t even want</text>
  <text start="3682.43" dur="3.659">to entertain that as a possibility so</text>
  <text start="3684.23" dur="3.72">then my advice to those people is at</text>
  <text start="3686.089" dur="5.431">least go get medication and go to</text>
  <text start="3687.95" dur="5.48">therapy and help your family and not not</text>
  <text start="3691.52" dur="4.68">bring down your family at least be</text>
  <text start="3693.43" dur="4.689">responsible but I think that everybody</text>
  <text start="3696.2" dur="5.19">if you&amp;#39;re if you struggle with anxiety</text>
  <text start="3698.119" dur="6.061">and depression especially there is a ton</text>
  <text start="3701.39" dur="5.13">of hope to be totally free of that</text>
  <text start="3704.18" dur="3.75">through inner healing and deliverance</text>
  <text start="3706.52" dur="3.569">and I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re mentioning</text>
  <text start="3707.93" dur="4.98">both because I think both are important</text>
  <text start="3710.089" dur="4.561">both do something different and it&amp;#39;s and</text>
  <text start="3712.91" dur="3.75">sometimes I see people only go through</text>
  <text start="3714.65" dur="4.35">deliverance or only go through inner</text>
  <text start="3716.66" dur="4.74">healing and I really think that it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="3719" dur="6.299">for maximum result it has to be a both</text>
  <text start="3721.4" dur="7.02">and yeah I agree it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been my</text>
  <text start="3725.299" dur="5.431">experience in my opinion that I think</text>
  <text start="3728.42" dur="4.59">every person walking the face of the</text>
  <text start="3730.73" dur="4.65">earth could be living in a greater level</text>
  <text start="3733.01" dur="4.95">of freedom and identity if they went</text>
  <text start="3735.38" dur="3.84">through at least a couple of hours of</text>
  <text start="3737.96" dur="3.69">emotional healing and deliverance</text>
  <text start="3739.22" dur="4.71">probably more it&amp;#39;s I find it really</text>
  <text start="3741.65" dur="4.649">difficult to imagine anyone who has</text>
  <text start="3743.93" dur="4.349">reached the age of 25 or 30 years old</text>
  <text start="3746.299" dur="4.02">who hasn&amp;#39;t suffered significant</text>
  <text start="3748.279" dur="4.59">emotional trauma in some way shape or</text>
  <text start="3750.319" dur="3.451">form right whether it&amp;#39;s through breaking</text>
  <text start="3752.869" dur="4.591">up with boyfriends and girlfriends</text>
  <text start="3753.77" dur="5.91">parental abuse I know so many guys who</text>
  <text start="3757.46" dur="3.869">struggle with pornography and when you</text>
  <text start="3759.68" dur="3.3">start digging around in their past</text>
  <text start="3761.329" dur="3.721">most of these guys have</text>
  <text start="3762.98" dur="3.69">sexual abuse as children even if you</text>
  <text start="3765.05" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t have a mental health diagnosis</text>
  <text start="3766.67" dur="3.72">whether you know anxiety depression or</text>
  <text start="3768.74" dur="3.57">bipolar or whatever most of the people</text>
  <text start="3770.39" dur="3.06">that I know they have some behavior that</text>
  <text start="3772.31" dur="2.97">they&amp;#39;re engaging in</text>
  <text start="3773.45" dur="3.36">that they would like to get victory over</text>
  <text start="3775.28" dur="4.079">and it seems like no matter what they do</text>
  <text start="3776.81" dur="4.29">they can&amp;#39;t get victory over and I I have</text>
  <text start="3779.359" dur="5.181">found that deliverance and inner healing</text>
  <text start="3781.1" dur="6.6">is really really powerful for</text>
  <text start="3784.54" dur="5.29">transforming your mind and getting rid</text>
  <text start="3787.7" dur="4.169">of those patterns of thinking and the</text>
  <text start="3789.83" dur="3.87">behaviors that you can&amp;#39;t seem to get rid</text>
  <text start="3791.869" dur="3.591">of any other way yeah I totally agree I</text>
  <text start="3793.7" dur="4.8">mean if people are struggling with</text>
  <text start="3795.46" dur="6.97">habitual secret sins that they just</text>
  <text start="3798.5" dur="6.93">can&amp;#39;t seem to break or habitual anxiety</text>
  <text start="3802.43" dur="5.61">that they can&amp;#39;t seem to get out of to me</text>
  <text start="3805.43" dur="4.38">that&amp;#39;s always a big red flag of hey</text>
  <text start="3808.04" dur="4.5">there&amp;#39;s more freedom available for you</text>
  <text start="3809.81" dur="5.22">here what I find is really the hang-up</text>
  <text start="3812.54" dur="4.92">is is how much freedom does that person</text>
  <text start="3815.03" dur="4.56">want to press in for well it&amp;#39;s usually</text>
  <text start="3817.46" dur="4.11">the biggest limitation it&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="3819.59" dur="4.2">mental illness it&amp;#39;s not the addiction</text>
  <text start="3821.57" dur="3.69">the biggest obstacle is there&amp;#39;s usually</text>
  <text start="3823.79" dur="3.36">something they don&amp;#39;t really want to</text>
  <text start="3825.26" dur="4.02">press in for that yet they&amp;#39;re not ready</text>
  <text start="3827.15" dur="4.05">or or they&amp;#39;re afraid or they don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="3829.28" dur="3.27">what&amp;#39;s on the other side of that yeah</text>
  <text start="3831.2" dur="3.9">that&amp;#39;s the thing that I see a lot is</text>
  <text start="3832.55" dur="5.19">people are very reluctant to go down</text>
  <text start="3835.1" dur="4.95">these pathways because they&amp;#39;re afraid of</text>
  <text start="3837.74" dur="3.78">what they&amp;#39;re going to run into or they</text>
  <text start="3840.05" dur="4.77">are thinking it&amp;#39;s going to take too much</text>
  <text start="3841.52" dur="6.93">time or it&amp;#39;s not possible I mean for me</text>
  <text start="3844.82" dur="5.37">I believe that Jesus is our role model</text>
  <text start="3848.45" dur="3.27">and I believe that if unless you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="3850.19" dur="3">walking in the kind of power and</text>
  <text start="3851.72" dur="4.23">authority and freedom that Jesus walked</text>
  <text start="3853.19" dur="4.29">in you probably could benefit from some</text>
  <text start="3855.95" dur="3.57">renewing of your mind</text>
  <text start="3857.48" dur="4.2">some deliverance some emotional healing</text>
  <text start="3859.52" dur="3.9">and further work that the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="3861.68" dur="5.97">wants to do to get you to a better place</text>
  <text start="3863.42" dur="5.64">yeah I agree I&amp;#39;m all about asking people</text>
  <text start="3867.65" dur="3.3">you know how much freedom you want to</text>
  <text start="3869.06" dur="3.99">press in for and I&amp;#39;ll be a stand with</text>
  <text start="3870.95" dur="5.1">you in that whatever it is you want to</text>
  <text start="3873.05" dur="4.83">press in to that because I always think</text>
  <text start="3876.05" dur="5.52">that there&amp;#39;s more available and God</text>
  <text start="3877.88" dur="5.91">wants to keep renewing us and healing us</text>
  <text start="3881.57" dur="4.14">and helping us walk in our identity and</text>
  <text start="3883.79" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s been ER this whole experience has</text>
  <text start="3885.71" dur="4.47">been quite a revelation for me because I</text>
  <text start="3887.93" dur="5.58">truly believe that deliverance is</text>
  <text start="3890.18" dur="5.82">available for every child of God that</text>
  <text start="3893.51" dur="3.27">his hope and dream for his children is</text>
  <text start="3896" dur="2.28">that</text>
  <text start="3896.78" dur="4.5">they walk in freedom and they walk in</text>
  <text start="3898.28" dur="7.14">their identity and when I came to that</text>
  <text start="3901.28" dur="7.56">realization then I had to have a I had</text>
  <text start="3905.42" dur="5.79">to rethink a lot of my previous theology</text>
  <text start="3908.84" dur="4.74">and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s been a the journey</text>
  <text start="3911.21" dur="4.44">that I said that&amp;#39;s the whole thing is</text>
  <text start="3913.58" dur="4.38">when you start to look at things like</text>
  <text start="3915.65" dur="4.68">interviewing and deliverance it forces</text>
  <text start="3917.96" dur="4.47">you to revamp your views of God and the</text>
  <text start="3920.33" dur="4.14">Holy Spirit when I&amp;#39;m doing emotional</text>
  <text start="3922.43" dur="4.56">healing I simply just invite Jesus into</text>
  <text start="3924.47" dur="4.26">the interaction the saying look Jesus is</text>
  <text start="3926.99" dur="3.78">gonna do this and he&amp;#39;s gonna do that for</text>
  <text start="3928.73" dur="4.47">you and it&amp;#39;s all about him doing it and</text>
  <text start="3930.77" dur="4.53">people get this different understanding</text>
  <text start="3933.2" dur="4.32">of who Jesus is just from having him</text>
  <text start="3935.3" dur="4.62">take away their anxiety to take away</text>
  <text start="3937.52" dur="3.78">their sadness and their anger and then</text>
  <text start="3939.92" dur="3.15">they get a different view of who Jesus</text>
  <text start="3941.3" dur="5.07">is and getting your understanding about</text>
  <text start="3943.07" dur="5.79">who God is is so important it is so if</text>
  <text start="3946.37" dur="4.53">people want to find you on social media</text>
  <text start="3948.86" dur="3.24">and learn more about what you&amp;#39;re up to</text>
  <text start="3950.9" dur="4.76">where can they find you</text>
