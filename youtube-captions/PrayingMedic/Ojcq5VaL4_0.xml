  <text start="112.869" dur="4.29">supernatural and sid roth it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="114.85" dur="5.25">supernatural is a television show that</text>
  <text start="117.159" dur="5.7">talks about the wonderful things that</text>
  <text start="120.1" dur="4.829">God does in a supernatural way and he</text>
  <text start="122.859" dur="3.781">interviews people who have seen angels</text>
  <text start="124.929" dur="4.231">or have been to heaven or have had</text>
  <text start="126.64" dur="4.77">experiences so of course you would have</text>
  <text start="129.16" dur="3.96">praying medic on the show and when he</text>
  <text start="131.41" dur="4.8">went to the show he brought a bunch of</text>
  <text start="133.12" dur="5.61">people just to keep alongside so why</text>
  <text start="136.21" dur="4.32">don&amp;#39;t you kind of talk about like how</text>
  <text start="138.73" dur="5.55">that came about because it was people</text>
  <text start="140.53" dur="5.31">who actually opened that door correct it</text>
  <text start="144.28" dur="4.459">was my group of friends who actually</text>

  <text start="148.739" dur="4.511">the whole thing</text>
  <text start="150.67" dur="5.1">came about in a very strange way first</text>
  <text start="153.25" dur="5.4">of all when people go into you know</text>
  <text start="155.77" dur="4.35">ministry quote-unquote when you get into</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="4.05">supernatural ministry whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="160.12" dur="5.49">healing or deliverance or whether you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="162.7" dur="5.46">leading people into the angelic realms</text>
  <text start="165.61" dur="5.25">one of the things you want to do is to</text>
  <text start="168.16" dur="4.86">get on the sid roth show because it has</text>
  <text start="170.86" dur="4.77">a huge audience big reach all around the</text>
  <text start="173.02" dur="5.07">world so if you can get an interview on</text>
  <text start="175.63" dur="4.68">Sid Roth it helps build your platform</text>

  <text start="180.31" dur="5.61">you sell more books you sell more dvds</text>
  <text start="183.19" dur="5.91">and cds have a big deal for people who</text>
  <text start="185.92" dur="6.899">are supernatural ministers well because</text>
  <text start="189.1" dur="6.75">i have an anonymous profile and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="192.819" dur="4.801">do video and I don&amp;#39;t have my picture out</text>
  <text start="195.85" dur="3.18">there when people started suggesting</text>
  <text start="197.62" dur="4.619">that i should try to get on the stage</text>
  <text start="199.03" dur="6.3">Roth show I was like yeah no that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="202.239" dur="6.511">going to happen not interested in doing</text>
  <text start="205.33" dur="5.7">TV or video I just was not interested so</text>
  <text start="208.75" dur="4.68">my wife Denise and I talked about it for</text>
  <text start="211.03" dur="5.07">a while and and she said look you know</text>
  <text start="213.43" dur="5.309">if you want to reach a wider audience</text>
  <text start="216.1" dur="5.669">you need to consider at least pray about</text>
  <text start="218.739" dur="5.851">going on the show so I had been praying</text>
  <text start="221.769" dur="5.731">for a while and what happened was a</text>
  <text start="224.59" dur="5.76">bunch of my friends turned me in to the</text>
  <text start="227.5" dur="5.519">sid roth producers they wrote letters</text>
  <text start="230.35" dur="4.41">they emailed those producers on the show</text>
  <text start="233.019" dur="3.78">and said hey you need to get ahold of</text>
  <text start="234.76" dur="4.229">praying medic and see if you can get him</text>
  <text start="236.799" dur="4.56">on your show so one day one of the</text>
  <text start="238.989" dur="6.78">producers wrote to me on facebook and</text>
  <text start="241.359" dur="6.781">said okay we got a bunch of requests</text>
  <text start="245.769" dur="3.571">from your friends asking if we would</text>
  <text start="248.14" dur="4.59">contact you and see if you&amp;#39;d be</text>
  <text start="249.34" dur="6.209">interested in being on the show so I</text>
  <text start="252.73" dur="6.92">said well no you know thank you very</text>
  <text start="255.549" dur="6.751">much but I&amp;#39;m really not all that is so</text>
  <text start="259.65" dur="5.56">we started some conversations and Denise</text>
  <text start="262.3" dur="4.83">said look you need to you need to really</text>
  <text start="265.21" dur="4.65">consider this so then God gave me a</text>
  <text start="267.13" dur="5.94">dream and in the dream there was</text>
  <text start="269.86" dur="6.3">somebody from sid roth who was trying to</text>
  <text start="273.07" dur="5.76">write a story about me and as they were</text>
  <text start="276.16" dur="4.98">writing this story the words that they</text>
  <text start="278.83" dur="5.64">wrote disappeared it was like they</text>
  <text start="281.14" dur="7.11">couldn&amp;#39;t get the story written about me</text>
  <text start="284.47" dur="8.19">and so I asked the Lord about the dream</text>
  <text start="288.25" dur="7.11">and he said look if Sid Roth if those</text>
  <text start="292.66" dur="4.83">folks are going to do a story on you you</text>
  <text start="295.36" dur="4.29">have to decide whether you want to do it</text>
  <text start="297.49" dur="4.29">or not if you want to do it I will open</text>
  <text start="299.65" dur="4.32">the door for you if you don&amp;#39;t want to do</text>
  <text start="301.78" dur="4.08">it just let me know I&amp;#39;ll close it or so</text>
  <text start="303.97" dur="4.44">the Lord is basically telling me I</text>
  <text start="305.86" dur="6.75">needed to make a decision he was leaving</text>
  <text start="308.41" dur="6.93">it up to me so I said okay you know what</text>
  <text start="312.61" dur="4.47">let&amp;#39;s just do this it&amp;#39;s like I had had</text>
  <text start="315.34" dur="5.85">another dream or two where the Lord</text>
  <text start="317.08" dur="6.9">showed me that if I continued to have an</text>
  <text start="321.19" dur="4.95">anonymous profile where I wouldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="323.98" dur="4.05">reveal my picture wouldn&amp;#39;t do video</text>
  <text start="326.14" dur="4.29">wouldn&amp;#39;t do any of this stuff it was</text>
  <text start="328.03" dur="6.51">going to limit the reach that I would</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="6.84">have with my message so I reluctantly</text>
  <text start="334.54" dur="5.82">gave in and I wrote back to producers</text>
  <text start="337.27" dur="4.59">and I said ok I will go through the</text>
  <text start="340.36" dur="3.99">process so there&amp;#39;s a little bit of a</text>
  <text start="341.86" dur="4.38">process they have a you have to fill out</text>
  <text start="344.35" dur="3.84">some forms and answer some questions and</text>
  <text start="346.24" dur="3.96">give your biographical information and</text>
  <text start="348.19" dur="4.229">tell me about when you got saved I</text>
  <text start="350.2" dur="3.42">submitted it and they said okay yeah</text>

  <text start="353.62" dur="4.86">that&amp;#39;s kind of what happened and then I</text>
  <text start="356.23" dur="5.1">announced to my friends and I was going</text>
  <text start="358.48" dur="5.85">to be on the show yes I think that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="361.33" dur="5.52">somehow if i&amp;#39;m not mistaken i think the</text>
  <text start="364.33" dur="5.13">first person who actually kind of found</text>
  <text start="366.85" dur="4.53">out besides denise of course but i think</text>

  <text start="371.38" dur="4.849">radio show i&amp;#39;m just trying to think i</text>
  <text start="373" dur="6.18">think it was touched by prayer that you</text>
  <text start="376.229" dur="4.661">because as soon as you say it was it was</text>
  <text start="379.18" dur="4.08">cuz as soon as you said it and you told</text>

  <text start="1781.69" dur="4.05">started to see like on my way back as I</text>
  <text start="1784.09" dur="3.93">was driving back to New Jersey from</text>
  <text start="1785.74" dur="4.71">North Carolina I was like rehashing all</text>
  <text start="1788.02" dur="5.63">the stuff that happened because there</text>
  <text start="1790.45" dur="6.3">were so many things that were so set up</text>
  <text start="1793.65" dur="5.29">they were so set up even leaving the</text>
  <text start="1796.75" dur="6.03">pants I got a chance to spend some time</text>
  <text start="1798.94" dur="5.1">with Denise which was so great because I</text>
  <text start="1802.78" dur="3.15">really kind of got a chance which</text>
  <text start="1804.04" dur="3.6">wouldn&amp;#39;t have happened if you didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1805.93" dur="3.81">have to come over to the hotel for up</text>
  <text start="1807.64" dur="4.56">and go shopping with her correct because</text>
  <text start="1809.74" dur="8.85">it takes a village to raise a pragmatic</text>
  <text start="1812.2" dur="7.95">Oh take a village I think that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1818.59" dur="4.29">the fun part about having a tribe</text>
  <text start="1820.15" dur="4.98">because in the China everybody has like</text>
  <text start="1822.88" dur="4.77">a little part to do and it was Paul who</text>
  <text start="1825.13" dur="5.01">called me because Denise didn&amp;#39;t have my</text>
  <text start="1827.65" dur="4.92">number you had my number that&amp;#39;s the fun</text>
  <text start="1830.14" dur="4.5">part of having a tribe is everybody</text>
  <text start="1832.57" dur="4.86">contributes a little bit to make what</text>
  <text start="1834.64" dur="3.96">the group is doing and I there&amp;#39;s no way</text>
  <text start="1837.43" dur="3.84">I would want to do this on my own</text>
  <text start="1838.6" dur="4.35">wouldn&amp;#39;t be any fun and wherever I go</text>
  <text start="1841.27" dur="4.41">whatever I do I&amp;#39;m always going to take</text>
  <text start="1842.95" dur="4.95">my tribe with me they are my portable</text>
  <text start="1845.68" dur="4.26">support group and they are going with me</text>
  <text start="1847.9" dur="3.87">wherever I go whatever I do they&amp;#39;re just</text>
  <text start="1849.94" dur="4.56">as no point in doing it without without</text>
  <text start="1851.77" dur="4.92">my my group of people who love me pray</text>
  <text start="1854.5" dur="5.58">for me support me and bail me out when I</text>
  <text start="1856.69" dur="6.33">get in trouble I I think I think one of</text>
  <text start="1860.08" dur="5.31">the reasons why there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="1863.02" dur="5.7">ministers who get into trouble and hot</text>
  <text start="1865.39" dur="6.99">water and I don&amp;#39;t I mean I literally</text>
  <text start="1868.72" dur="6.69">seem to avoid almost all the problems</text>
  <text start="1872.38" dur="6.06">that a lot of people have is because I</text>
  <text start="1875.41" dur="4.68">have this amazing group of people who</text>
  <text start="1878.44" dur="4.32">are friends and I know that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1880.09" dur="5.73">praying for me and I know that I can</text>
  <text start="1882.76" dur="5.73">count on them to get things done and to</text>
  <text start="1885.82" dur="4.77">connect with people and that</text>
  <text start="1888.49" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s almost like the more I leaned on my</text>
  <text start="1890.59" dur="5.04">friends the less likely i am to run into</text>
  <text start="1893.74" dur="4.2">troubles well I mean think about what</text>
  <text start="1895.63" dur="6.69">Jesus did I mean he had his apostles and</text>
  <text start="1897.94" dur="6.78">he was Jesus but he had a posse like he</text>
  <text start="1902.32" dur="4.38">had people with him that did and then</text>
  <text start="1904.72" dur="4.05">there were certain people who he took</text>
  <text start="1906.7" dur="4.979">for certain things but he still had his</text>
  <text start="1908.77" dur="4.68">apostles and then after Jesus went then</text>
  <text start="1911.679" dur="4.971">there was the apostles who then had</text>
  <text start="1913.45" dur="6.24">their posse and everybody had somebody</text>
  <text start="1916.65" dur="5.2">because I think when you&amp;#39;re by yourself</text>
  <text start="1919.69" dur="4.53">you become a target you become</text>
  <text start="1921.85" dur="4.29">vulnerable you do become vulnerable and</text>
  <text start="1924.22" dur="6.3">I really believe in strength in numbers</text>
  <text start="1926.14" dur="7.8">I know that I&amp;#39;m kept safe and secure by</text>
  <text start="1930.52" dur="5.31">God primarily through the relationships</text>
  <text start="1933.94" dur="5.04">that I have with my friends well and</text>
  <text start="1935.83" dur="4.95">those relationships like if you really</text>
  <text start="1938.98" dur="3.6">think about it if you if you try to sit</text>
  <text start="1940.78" dur="3.87">back and say how did these things even</text>
  <text start="1942.58" dur="5.37">start you have to know is divinely</text>
  <text start="1944.65" dur="4.95">orchestrated there&amp;#39;s just no way like</text>
  <text start="1947.95" dur="4.17">people are living in different states</text>
  <text start="1949.6" dur="4.98">you wouldn&amp;#39;t if it weren&amp;#39;t for facebook</text>
  <text start="1952.12" dur="5.7">like you wouldn&amp;#39;t but they&amp;#39;re your tribe</text>
  <text start="1954.58" dur="5.58">which is so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s such a different</text>
  <text start="1957.82" dur="5.16">mentality that we have and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1960.16" dur="5.28">actually so blessed that God is able to</text>
  <text start="1962.98" dur="6.3">pull us together and to bring people</text>
  <text start="1965.44" dur="6.78">into we think alike we&amp;#39;re going on the</text>
  <text start="1969.28" dur="5.61">same path we have the same ideas like</text>
  <text start="1972.22" dur="5.19">there there is no division where it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1974.89" dur="5.1">unity and I think that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="1977.41" dur="4.44">strength is coming from the strength is</text>
  <text start="1979.99" dur="4.86">in the unity and I know that that is</text>
  <text start="1981.85" dur="6.36">something God is emphasizing a lot more</text>
  <text start="1984.85" dur="6.5">as time go move forward is he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1988.21" dur="6.48">want his people at odds with each other</text>
  <text start="1991.35" dur="7">and divided and separated into camps he</text>
  <text start="1994.69" dur="5.91">wants unity and what we&amp;#39;re doing is I</text>
  <text start="1998.35" dur="4.709">think an example of what he wants to do</text>
  <text start="2000.6" dur="4.079">on a very large scale I agree which is I</text>
  <text start="2003.059" dur="3.87">mean we all have slightly different</text>
  <text start="2004.679" dur="4.321">views and different experiences and</text>
  <text start="2006.929" dur="4.261">different perspectives you know</text>
  <text start="2009" dur="3.51">theological e and whatever but none of</text>
  <text start="2011.19" dur="3.3">that stuff really matters when we get</text>
  <text start="2012.51" dur="4.74">together it&amp;#39;s all about getting together</text>
  <text start="2014.49" dur="4.2">hanging out and enjoying each other&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2017.25" dur="4.65">company and talking about what God is</text>
  <text start="2018.69" dur="3.72">doing right and I think that is what God</text>
  <text start="2021.9" dur="3.27">wants to</text>
  <text start="2022.41" dur="5.16">on a large scale and so it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="2025.17" dur="4.05">starting in in facebook with like these</text>
  <text start="2027.57" dur="4.44">groups with with these little</text>
  <text start="2029.22" dur="6.78">discussions what what is also</text>
  <text start="2032.01" dur="6.09">interesting is as you start to show</text>
  <text start="2036" dur="4.02">stuff of other people now other people</text>
  <text start="2038.1" dur="3.45">are starting to say hey this person</text>
  <text start="2040.02" dur="4.38">keeps saying let me let me check them</text>
  <text start="2041.55" dur="7.74">out so it actually helps to broaden the</text>
  <text start="2044.4" dur="6.39">the reach that&amp;#39;s by design I post a lot</text>
  <text start="2049.29" dur="4.139">of different kind a lot of different</text>
  <text start="2050.79" dur="5.43">subjects on facebook because I&amp;#39;m trying</text>
  <text start="2053.429" dur="5.521">to draw my circle of friends out of</text>
  <text start="2056.22" dur="5.25">their little caves out into the open so</text>
  <text start="2058.95" dur="5.61">that other people who are my friends can</text>
  <text start="2061.47" dur="5.55">get to know people they don&amp;#39;t know and</text>

  <text start="2067.02" dur="3.03">feel the same way I had a same</text>
  <text start="2068.28" dur="3.18">experience and then pretty soon they</text>
  <text start="2070.05" dur="2.85">have their own little rabbit trail going</text>

  <text start="2359.74" dur="4.2">if they don&amp;#39;t get to use that influence</text>
  <text start="2362.08" dur="4.23">and the people that they have those</text>
  <text start="2363.94" dur="4.05">people might not get to see like the</text>

  <text start="2432.94" dur="4.919">the gift in them well I think some</text>
  <text start="2435.91" dur="3.66">people get so afraid of promoting</text>
  <text start="2437.859" dur="4.021">somebody else because they think that</text>

  <text start="2474.72" dur="5.62">everybody is equally treasured and</text>
  <text start="2477.04" dur="5.04">equally valued equally treasured equally</text>
  <text start="2480.34" dur="5.13">valued and there is no competition in</text>
  <text start="2482.08" dur="6.15">the kingdom in the world people think in</text>
  <text start="2485.47" dur="6.81">terms of I look at the at the business</text>
  <text start="2488.23" dur="6.359">community as a pie and what I need to do</text>
  <text start="2492.28" dur="4.29">is you slice the pie into a bunch of</text>
  <text start="2494.589" dur="4.801">little pieces and you think this is my</text>
  <text start="2496.57" dur="5.58">slice of the pie if I promote somebody</text>
  <text start="2499.39" dur="5.1">else and they are going to get a larger</text>
  <text start="2502.15" dur="4.949">slice of the pie that means my slice of</text>
  <text start="2504.49" dur="5.42">the pie is going to get smaller that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2507.099" dur="7.081">what they said but in the kingdom</text>
  <text start="2509.91" dur="8.38">because there is no lack of anything it</text>
  <text start="2514.18" dur="6.6">is an infinitely expandable pie so if I</text>
  <text start="2518.29" dur="6.29">promote Jeremy magor sheen or Jesse</text>
  <text start="2520.78" dur="5.97">berkey or Ginny relax Michael Van blamin</text>
  <text start="2524.58" dur="4.99">Michael and I right Allah same subjects</text>
  <text start="2526.75" dur="5.55">but I love promoting his books because I</text>
  <text start="2529.57" dur="4.59">know that if I promote Michael and</text>
  <text start="2532.3" dur="3.36">Michael&amp;#39;s book sales go up it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2534.16" dur="5.73">mean my book sales are going to go down</text>
  <text start="2535.66" dur="7.199">God can expand the pie to accommodate</text>
  <text start="2539.89" dur="4.56">whatever he wants to so it doesn&amp;#39;t mean</text>
  <text start="2542.859" dur="4.591">that if I promote somebody else&amp;#39;s stuff</text>
  <text start="2544.45" dur="4.71">that I&amp;#39;m going to lose out a sale but</text>
  <text start="2547.45" dur="4.34">that I could have had it doesn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="2549.16" dur="5.07">that way God is able to bless people</text>
  <text start="2551.79" dur="4.42">infinitely and he&amp;#39;s able to bring in</text>
  <text start="2554.23" dur="3.51">infinite increase</text>
  <text start="2556.21" dur="3.03">there&amp;#39;s no reason for us to think that</text>
  <text start="2557.74" dur="3.72">we&amp;#39;re competing against each other we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2559.24" dur="4.349">not competing against each other but you</text>
  <text start="2561.46" dur="4.92">also have a different view of the same</text>
  <text start="2563.589" dur="4.051">topic sure the way that you write it is</text>
  <text start="2566.38" dur="3.239">going to be different because it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2567.64" dur="4.08">to be how you see it and the way that he</text>
  <text start="2569.619" dur="4.191">writes it is going to see how he sees it</text>
  <text start="2571.72" dur="3.75">so what happens if you get both books</text>
  <text start="2573.81" dur="3.91">you&amp;#39;re gonna get different perspectives</text>
  <text start="2575.47" dur="4.53">is gonna make you think differently it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2577.72" dur="4.5">going to expand your thought processes</text>
  <text start="2580" dur="4.92">but everybody wrote the same it would be</text>
  <text start="2582.22" dur="4.649">a very boring place so light be a very</text>
  <text start="2584.92" dur="4.32">boring place and nobody has all the</text>
  <text start="2586.869" dur="3.961">revelation right you know I was talking</text>
  <text start="2589.24" dur="3.44">to jeremy now you&amp;#39;re Shane and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2590.83" dur="4.5">talking about maybe writing a book on</text>
  <text start="2592.68" dur="5.11">visions and I said dude you should</text>
  <text start="2595.33" dur="4.86">absolutely right that book because the</text>
  <text start="2597.79" dur="4.559">last book on this subject has not yet</text>
  <text start="2600.19" dur="5.1">been written Michael wrote a really good</text>
  <text start="2602.349" dur="5.101">one and I wrote one but there is a lot</text>
  <text start="2605.29" dur="4.38">to say on the subject of seeing of the</text>
  <text start="2607.45" dur="4.35">Spirit and seeing visions that has not</text>
  <text start="2609.67" dur="6.15">yet been written so I would encourage</text>
  <text start="2611.8" dur="6.63">anyone who has some good revelation and</text>
  <text start="2615.82" dur="5.01">is a good teacher to write a book even</text>
  <text start="2618.43" dur="4.14">though there&amp;#39;s already ten or fifteen</text>
  <text start="2620.83" dur="3.87">books on that subject it doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text>
  <text start="2622.57" dur="4.74">write your book because you probably</text>
  <text start="2624.7" dur="4.56">have a perspective some experiences and</text>
  <text start="2627.31" dur="5.549">some revelation that the body of Christ</text>
  <text start="2629.26" dur="5.55">needs to have and it&amp;#39;s different because</text>
  <text start="2632.859" dur="4.021">each experience that people have with</text>
  <text start="2634.81" dur="3.75">God is different nobody has the exact</text>
  <text start="2636.88" dur="3.6">same experiences there might be some</text>
  <text start="2638.56" dur="4.289">similarities but it&amp;#39;s always going to be</text>
  <text start="2640.48" dur="5.31">different right because he&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="2642.849" dur="6.121">cookie-cutter kind of guide he&amp;#39;s not and</text>
  <text start="2645.79" dur="5.73">everybody relates things differently</text>
  <text start="2648.97" dur="5.46">some people receive like some people can</text>
  <text start="2651.52" dur="5.01">receive revelation for me and they can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2654.43" dur="4.23">receive the same revelation from Michael</text>
  <text start="2656.53" dur="4.68">the environment and vice versa and some</text>
  <text start="2658.66" dur="4.5">people can listen to todd Bentley all</text>
  <text start="2661.21" dur="4.26">day long but they can&amp;#39;t listen to Ian</text>
  <text start="2663.16" dur="3.78">Clayton or some people can listen to Ian</text>
  <text start="2665.47" dur="4.379">Clayton but they can&amp;#39;t listen to Justin</text>
  <text start="2666.94" dur="5.34">Abraham the god has different people</text>
  <text start="2669.849" dur="4.861">speaking similar messages different</text>
  <text start="2672.28" dur="4.02">messages but similar couched in a</text>
  <text start="2674.71" dur="3.899">different language different experiences</text>
  <text start="2676.3" dur="4.35">because we&amp;#39;re all different with all the</text>
  <text start="2678.609" dur="3.721">different preferences so I have my</text>
  <text start="2680.65" dur="4.59">favorite teachers and you have your</text>
  <text start="2682.33" dur="4.83">favorite teachers and they&amp;#39;re not the</text>
  <text start="2685.24" dur="4.8">same thing because we&amp;#39;re just different</text>
  <text start="2687.16" dur="5.58">right and I think that&amp;#39;s the cool</text>
  <text start="2690.04" dur="5.16">hard is that if we can start doing</text>
  <text start="2692.74" dur="4.5">everything in a unified fashion then</text>
  <text start="2695.2" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;re going to actually we can also</text>
  <text start="2697.24" dur="3.33">start to see somebody else&amp;#39;s perspective</text>
  <text start="2698.83" dur="3.12">in something which might actually open</text>
  <text start="2700.57" dur="3.87">up something that could have been</text>
  <text start="2701.95" dur="4.59">blocked or locked inside of us because I</text>
  <text start="2704.44" dur="5.28">also think sometimes if you have bad</text>
  <text start="2706.54" dur="7.38">theology do you know what I mean you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2709.72" dur="6.9">going to not so much welcome new so but</text>
  <text start="2713.92" dur="4.5">if you&amp;#39;re always open to stuff you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2716.62" dur="3.78">always going to be able to weed out what</text>
  <text start="2718.42" dur="3.99">like this but I don&amp;#39;t agree with that or</text>
  <text start="2720.4" dur="4.26">maybe I kind of like this but it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="2722.41" dur="4.89">to it&amp;#39;s going to keep you open and I</text>
  <text start="2724.66" dur="5.28">think that as we don&amp;#39;t put that into the</text>
  <text start="2727.3" dur="5.01">box and we always a look I guess allow</text>
  <text start="2729.94" dur="4.49">him to be open that we&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="2732.31" dur="5.28">to see things in a different perspective</text>
  <text start="2734.43" dur="6.37">yeah I would agree with that I think the</text>
  <text start="2737.59" dur="4.53">more we allow God to be who he is what</text>
  <text start="2740.8" dur="3.6">he wants to do without putting</text>
  <text start="2742.12" dur="5.04">restrictions on it it gives him the</text>
  <text start="2744.4" dur="4.32">ability to do greater things and it</text>
  <text start="2747.16" dur="3.84">gives us the ability to witness</text>
  <text start="2748.72" dur="4.41">experience greater things and you know</text>
  <text start="2751" dur="4.08">by promoting other people and and or</text>
  <text start="2753.13" dur="4.53">just bringing them along with us you</text>
  <text start="2755.08" dur="4.08">know I was kind of saying before we</text>
  <text start="2757.66" dur="3.69">started the show I was saying that I I</text>
  <text start="2759.16" dur="3.66">keep seeing a barrel full of monkeys and</text>
  <text start="2761.35" dur="3.66">if you&amp;#39;ve never seen a barrel full of</text>
  <text start="2762.82" dur="3.9">monkeys they were these plastic monkeys</text>
  <text start="2765.01" dur="3.48">that were in a barrel and they all had</text>
  <text start="2766.72" dur="3.03">these big arms and you would just scoop</text>
  <text start="2768.49" dur="3.27">up and you would just see how many</text>
  <text start="2769.75" dur="4.41">monkeys you can get on that chain and I</text>
  <text start="2771.76" dur="4.59">and I think that that barrel full of</text>
  <text start="2774.16" dur="3.93">monkeys is just what God is trying to do</text>
  <text start="2776.35" dur="3.03">it&amp;#39;s like as he&amp;#39;s going to start pulling</text>
  <text start="2778.09" dur="3.12">people up other people are gonna latch</text>
  <text start="2779.38" dur="3.48">on you&amp;#39;re gonna grab on they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2781.21" dur="3.03">grab onto your feet or grab onto your</text>
  <text start="2782.86" dur="3.81">arm you&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re going to start</text>
  <text start="2784.24" dur="5.52">pulling them up because every person has</text>
  <text start="2786.67" dur="6">a part to play and it&amp;#39;s about building</text>
  <text start="2789.76" dur="5.01">the kingdom and I think that&amp;#39;s the cool</text>
  <text start="2792.67" dur="5.49">part so as we open the door to let our</text>
  <text start="2794.77" dur="5.4">friends come through it&amp;#39;s also fun to be</text>
  <text start="2798.16" dur="5.19">with your friends as things start to get</text>
  <text start="2800.17" dur="5.52">more exciting too there is an</text>
  <text start="2803.35" dur="5.7">interesting revelation that God gave me</text>
  <text start="2805.69" dur="6">about the sid roth show he&amp;#39;s given me a</text>
  <text start="2809.05" dur="4.5">number of Dreams showing me that the</text>
  <text start="2811.69" dur="4.08">traffic to my website is going to</text>
  <text start="2813.55" dur="4.14">increase and that there are going to be</text>
  <text start="2815.77" dur="4.23">some people who will show up on my</text>
  <text start="2817.69" dur="4.44">website and start leaving comments with</text>
  <text start="2820" dur="3.96">links to their websites only because</text>
  <text start="2822.13" dur="3.479">they want to</text>

  <text start="2825.609" dur="3.781">popularity of the website as it grows</text>
  <text start="2827.38" dur="3.959">and as more people show up and more</text>
  <text start="2829.39" dur="3.78">people are reading the messages reading</text>
  <text start="2831.339" dur="4.831">the comments some people are going to</text>
  <text start="2833.17" dur="5.22">show up just to get more exposure to</text>
  <text start="2836.17" dur="4.38">their website by leaving comments well</text>
  <text start="2838.39" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;ve actually already seen some of that</text>
  <text start="2840.55" dur="4.92">happening and anytime somebody develops</text>
  <text start="2843.4" dur="4.26">a little bit bigger platform or God</text>
  <text start="2845.47" dur="4.83">opens a door and he&amp;#39;s given them favor</text>
  <text start="2847.66" dur="5.04">in new areas there are people who want</text>
  <text start="2850.3" dur="4.62">to go along for the ride simply because</text>
  <text start="2852.7" dur="3.33">they want to be part of what&amp;#39;s popular</text>
  <text start="2854.92" dur="3.21">or they want more exposure for</text>
  <text start="2856.03" dur="5.79">themselves and then there are people</text>
