  <text start="1231.5" dur="4.77">but where most of the time scratching</text>
  <text start="1233.9" dur="5.31">our head going what does it mean what</text>
  <text start="1236.27" dur="6.24">the purpose of it doesn&amp;#39;t even have some</text>
  <text start="1239.21" dur="5.79">obvious significance well my theory is</text>
  <text start="1242.51" dur="3.57">this God actually has a purpose for</text>
  <text start="1245" dur="4.92">traveling in the spirit</text>
  <text start="1246.08" dur="7.5">there are several purposes but in order</text>
  <text start="1249.92" dur="7.02">for us to be able to fulfill those</text>
  <text start="1253.58" dur="6.23">purposes we have to first get a grid of</text>
  <text start="1256.94" dur="5.97">understanding in our mind of what is</text>
  <text start="1259.81" dur="4.72">possible what can be done right and he</text>
  <text start="1262.91" dur="3.78">sometimes does that through these</text>
  <text start="1264.53" dur="4.98">strange little experiences that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1266.69" dur="6.56">understand when they first happened so</text>
  <text start="1269.51" dur="7.5">you go to somebody else&amp;#39;s house or</text>
  <text start="1273.25" dur="6.1">you&amp;#39;re in a dream and you have a very</text>
  <text start="1277.01" dur="3.33">very real awareness that you are</text>
  <text start="1279.35" dur="4.08">somewhere else and you&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1280.34" dur="5.4">something and then BOOM you literally</text>
  <text start="1283.43" dur="4.89">fall into your bed when the experience</text>
  <text start="1285.74" dur="4.32">is over you&amp;#39;re wide oh yes and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1288.32" dur="4.02">looking around wondering where was I</text>
  <text start="1290.06" dur="4.29">when was happen it was experiences a lot</text>
  <text start="1292.34" dur="4.17">of people don&amp;#39;t understand what they</text>
  <text start="1294.35" dur="4.83">mean what the significance of them is I</text>
  <text start="1296.51" dur="5.97">think those are practice experiences ah</text>
  <text start="1299.18" dur="7.2">I think that the Lord is giving us these</text>
  <text start="1302.48" dur="6.3">experiences just to let us know this is</text>
  <text start="1306.38" dur="4.77">possible it&amp;#39;s something you can do yeah</text>
  <text start="1308.78" dur="4.23">it&amp;#39;s something I want you to do and I</text>
  <text start="1311.15" dur="5.24">want you to get a little taste of it yes</text>
  <text start="1313.01" dur="6.96">as I want to do bigger greater things</text>
  <text start="1316.39" dur="7.12">but first you need to be aware that this</text>
  <text start="1319.97" dur="6.27">is possible that&amp;#39;s good I was having a</text>
  <text start="1323.51" dur="4.95">chat with a friend recently and she had</text>
  <text start="1326.24" dur="5.82">shared an experience where she was</text>
  <text start="1328.46" dur="7.53">praying and and and while she was</text>

  <text start="1339.95" dur="4.32">she said the Lord said there was she saw</text>
  <text start="1341.78" dur="4.89">a little boy and she said she heard the</text>
  <text start="1344.27" dur="5.37">Lord say to tell that boy to run and so</text>

  <text start="1372.35" dur="3.3">of the building so she&amp;#39;s yelling at them</text>
  <text start="1374.84" dur="2.969">to get out of the building</text>

  <text start="1553.789" dur="3.901">the two big questions I had not been</text>
  <text start="1555.559" dur="5.73">able to answer right so I talked to</text>
  <text start="1557.69" dur="6.719">Michael and I said dude this part of the</text>
  <text start="1561.289" dur="5.55">process is absolutely critical thank you</text>
  <text start="1564.409" dur="4.23">so much for like being obedient and</text>
  <text start="1566.839" dur="4.68">going through the process and</text>

  <text start="1571.519" dur="5.16">is going to let me put that part of the</text>
  <text start="1573.919" dur="6.09">process in my book oh nice because I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1576.679" dur="5.1">trying to paint a big picture yeah what</text>
  <text start="1580.009" dur="3.63">this whole thing looks like the other</text>
  <text start="1581.779" dur="4.71">big question that I had that I had not</text>
  <text start="1583.639" dur="5.7">been able to answer was is astral</text>
  <text start="1586.489" dur="6.03">projection the same thing Christians do</text>
  <text start="1589.339" dur="6.89">when they travel in the spirit mm-hmm if</text>
  <text start="1592.519" dur="7.29">it is or if it is not how can I</text>
  <text start="1596.229" dur="4.961">objectively prove that yes that was the</text>
  <text start="1599.809" dur="4.5">other big question that I had to answer</text>
  <text start="1601.19" dur="3.419">and I was I was not coming up with an</text>
  <text start="1604.309" dur="2.85">answer</text>
  <text start="1604.609" dur="5.07">oh yeah I had some theories and I had</text>
  <text start="1607.159" dur="5.4">some ideas like everybody does yeah but</text>
  <text start="1609.679" dur="6.54">I had no real good objective way to</text>
  <text start="1612.559" dur="5.49">evaluate it until I just decided I had</text>
  <text start="1616.219" dur="4.92">to read some books on astral projection</text>
  <text start="1618.049" dur="4.171">yes and look at how they describe the</text>
  <text start="1621.139" dur="4.231">process</text>
  <text start="1622.22" dur="4.829">then look at what we&amp;#39;re doing and look</text>
  <text start="1625.37" dur="4.41">at how we describe the process and then</text>
  <text start="1627.049" dur="4.801">put the two of them side by side here</text>
  <text start="1629.78" dur="3.54">are the things that both processes have</text>
  <text start="1631.85" dur="3.689">in common here are the things that they</text>
  <text start="1633.32" dur="4.08">have it that are different yes so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1635.539" dur="5.311">what I did I read a couple of books on</text>
  <text start="1637.4" dur="5.759">astral projection and you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="1640.85" dur="4.319">read a whole lot of testimonies before</text>
  <text start="1643.159" dur="4.441">you start to understand there are some</text>
  <text start="1645.169" dur="3.63">significant differences hmm there are</text>
  <text start="1647.6" dur="3.63">some similarities</text>
  <text start="1648.799" dur="3.901">but there are some significant</text>
  <text start="1651.23" dur="3.84">differences where you can look at and go</text>
  <text start="1652.7" dur="4.08">no this is not the same yeah very</text>
  <text start="1655.07" dur="5.01">similar but it&amp;#39;s not the same thing</text>
  <text start="1656.78" dur="5.55">so once I had read the books on astral</text>
  <text start="1660.08" dur="5.4">projection and understood the process</text>
  <text start="1662.33" dur="5.01">they use and had two or three dozen</text>
  <text start="1665.48" dur="4.35">testimonies from Christians yeah about</text>
  <text start="1667.34" dur="6.06">how we travel in the spirit I was able</text>
  <text start="1669.83" dur="7.11">to put this into a discussion where I</text>
  <text start="1673.4" dur="6">can I think very soundly and objectively</text>
  <text start="1676.94" dur="4.67">say these are not the same thing that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1679.4" dur="5.909">good stuff let me ask you a question</text>
  <text start="1681.61" dur="6.97">this topic I have to just ask as a</text>
  <text start="1685.309" dur="5.811">writer you know when you&amp;#39;re writing</text>
  <text start="1688.58" dur="7.2">books you know about the kingdom and</text>
  <text start="1691.12" dur="7.6">there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that are very I</text>
  <text start="1695.78" dur="5.009">guess I would say they&amp;#39;re uncommon to</text>
  <text start="1698.72" dur="3.6">the majority I would I would go so far</text>
  <text start="1700.789" dur="4.081">as to say the majority of Christians</text>
  <text start="1702.32" dur="5.729">okay that&amp;#39;s right you&amp;#39;re reading oh</text>
  <text start="1704.87" dur="6">you&amp;#39;re writing on fringe topics yes do</text>
  <text start="1708.049" dur="8.49">you ever just personally experience any</text>
  <text start="1710.87" dur="7.89">types of angst or fear anxiety or</text>
  <text start="1716.539" dur="5.13">anything like that related to releasing</text>
  <text start="1718.76" dur="5.909">books on topics like this knowing the</text>
  <text start="1721.669" dur="4.291">potential the types of feedback that</text>
  <text start="1724.669" dur="2.551">you&amp;#39;re going to receive do you ever deal</text>
  <text start="1725.96" dur="4.68">would you struggle with that personally</text>
  <text start="1727.22" dur="5.31">at all the Lord has shown me he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="1730.64" dur="3.539">very gracious and has shown me the</text>
  <text start="1732.53" dur="5.129">trajectory of my writing years in</text>
  <text start="1734.179" dur="4.921">advance and I knew that as I started to</text>
  <text start="1737.659" dur="4.801">get into subjects that are a bit more</text>
  <text start="1739.1" dur="6.209">taboo yes and less accepted that there</text>
  <text start="1742.46" dur="6.449">would be more resistance yeah and more</text>
  <text start="1745.309" dur="4.021">criticism yeah more skepticism I&amp;#39;m aware</text>
  <text start="1748.909" dur="2.221">of that</text>
  <text start="1749.33" dur="3.81">yeah I&amp;#39;ve been aware of it for a few</text>
  <text start="1751.13" dur="4.89">years the Lord gave me a dream a few</text>

  <text start="1833.33" dur="4.08">like really and the thing was it was all</text>
  <text start="1835.73" dur="3.78">the Lord like I couldn&amp;#39;t have even come</text>
  <text start="1837.41" dur="4.26">up with that stuff on you know on my own</text>
  <text start="1839.51" dur="4.8">just the way it all came together but I</text>
  <text start="1841.67" dur="5.46">will tell you that I dealt with that</text>
  <text start="1844.31" dur="4.83">concern not so much what people said</text>
  <text start="1847.13" dur="4.71">because I you know I still to this day</text>
  <text start="1849.14" dur="4.8">and always have stood firm that you know</text>
  <text start="1851.84" dur="4.2">I&amp;#39;m just doing this out of obedience and</text>
  <text start="1853.94" dur="3.96">you know the feedback positive has</text>
  <text start="1856.04" dur="3.66">always outweighed the negative but I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1857.9" dur="5.58">tell you what it actually sent me when I</text>
  <text start="1859.7" dur="6.03">had a string of negative experiences and</text>
  <text start="1863.48" dur="7.02">negative feedback and just like just</text>
  <text start="1865.73" dur="6.54">nastiness I back for for several months</text>
  <text start="1870.5" dur="3">I shrunk back for several months that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1872.27" dur="4.02">like I didn&amp;#39;t want to share it so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1873.5" dur="4.47">like gosh why if we just you know if if</text>
  <text start="1876.29" dur="3.87">this is just with a few thousand people</text>
  <text start="1877.97" dur="3.51">seeing and a few hundred books sold what</text>
  <text start="1880.16" dur="3.51">in the world is this gonna look like</text>
  <text start="1881.48" dur="4.14">when it&amp;#39;s you know 10 times this much</text>
  <text start="1883.67" dur="3.54">right because you know I already knew</text>
  <text start="1885.62" dur="3.85">that the Lord said this was going to go</text>
  <text start="1887.21" dur="4.599">much further than I had imagined</text>
  <text start="1889.47" dur="3.78">and so I actually shrunk back for</text>
  <text start="1891.809" dur="3.87">several months and it&amp;#39;s just actually</text>
  <text start="1893.25" dur="4.379">recently the Lord started putting this</text>
  <text start="1895.679" dur="4.95">back on my heart like you need to go and</text>
  <text start="1897.629" dur="5.01">do this and so I just decided after</text>
  <text start="1900.629" dur="3.78">months of looking at he way he had me</text>
  <text start="1902.639" dur="3.54">doing you had the dream right so you saw</text>
  <text start="1904.409" dur="4.74">that coming from your dream what he did</text>
  <text start="1906.179" dur="5.671">with me is he&amp;#39;d have me on Facebook</text>
  <text start="1909.149" dur="4.591">looking at the social media profiles of</text>
  <text start="1911.85" dur="4.679">a few people who tend to ruffle feathers</text>
  <text start="1913.74" dur="6.12">okay and you know people like for</text>
  <text start="1916.529" dur="4.86">example out of Bethel Church or or you</text>
  <text start="1919.86" dur="3.84">know a few people in the marketplace who</text>
  <text start="1921.389" dur="5.311">say some stuff that you know can really</text>
  <text start="1923.7" dur="5.28">get Christians riled up and even</text>
  <text start="1926.7" dur="4.05">celebrities like someone like Candace</text>
  <text start="1928.98" dur="3.779">Cameron Bure who all she wears is a</text>
  <text start="1930.75" dur="3.509">t-shirt and people lose their minds you</text>
  <text start="1932.759" dur="3.15">know like you know are you really a</text>
  <text start="1934.259" dur="3.3">Christian yet that bee is showing a</text>
  <text start="1935.909" dur="3.571">little bit too much skin you know so</text>
  <text start="1937.559" dur="3.99">anyway so he had me looking at all of</text>
  <text start="1939.48" dur="4.679">these folks and watching how people were</text>
  <text start="1941.549" dur="4.08">just so nasty you know on their social</text>
  <text start="1944.159" dur="2.791">media profiles and I&amp;#39;m like Laura this</text>
  <text start="1945.629" dur="2.55">is not helping why are you showing me</text>
  <text start="1946.95" dur="4.679">this because it was just it was it was</text>
  <text start="1948.179" dur="5.011">such it was horrible to look at and what</text>
  <text start="1951.629" dur="3.18">he showed me he had me looking at that</text>
  <text start="1953.19" dur="3.75">stuff for months and eventually he said</text>
  <text start="1954.809" dur="4.441">now how are they dealing with it and I</text>
  <text start="1956.94" dur="3.63">looked and I realized they weren&amp;#39;t and</text>
  <text start="1959.25" dur="2.7">I&amp;#39;m like they&amp;#39;re not dealing with it</text>
  <text start="1960.57" dur="3.569">like they&amp;#39;re not saying anything and</text>
  <text start="1961.95" dur="3.809">then he said now look and I looked again</text>
  <text start="1964.139" dur="3.87">and I realized that not only were they</text>
  <text start="1965.759" dur="4.441">not doing anything but the people who</text>
  <text start="1968.009" dur="4.981">understood the people who get it they</text>
  <text start="1970.2" dur="4.229">were on top of the people who were</text>
  <text start="1972.99" dur="2.939">causing all the ruckus</text>
  <text start="1974.429" dur="3.21">you know they would go say like you know</text>
  <text start="1975.929" dur="4.74">you&amp;#39;re nuts you know you don&amp;#39;t get it or</text>
  <text start="1977.639" dur="4.831">whatever and the Lord said to me I fight</text>
  <text start="1980.669" dur="4.71">your battles and in fact others fight</text>
  <text start="1982.47" dur="4.89">them for you too and with that I just</text>
  <text start="1985.379" dur="3.39">was like I just have to I just have to</text>

  <text start="1988.769" dur="5.04">actually that&amp;#39;s why I asked the question</text>
  <text start="1991.47" dur="3.839">I just wonder whether I was alone and</text>
  <text start="1993.809" dur="3.301">having those types of curses let me I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1995.309" dur="5.641">moving forward anyway but I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
