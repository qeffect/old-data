  <text start="2.37" dur="4.469">part of what&amp;#39;s happened over the last</text>
  <text start="4.35" dur="5.579">three years and then we want to write</text>
  <text start="6.839" dur="7.081">get right into the teaching because of</text>
  <text start="9.929" dur="5.191">the limitation on time but I feel like</text>
  <text start="13.92" dur="5.97">God really wants to do something</text>
  <text start="15.12" dur="7.98">powerful today and so just prepare your</text>
  <text start="19.89" dur="5.49">spirit just sit back and relax and just</text>
  <text start="23.1" dur="6.599">allow the Holy Spirit to consume you</text>
  <text start="25.38" dur="8.85">this morning three years ago I went to</text>
  <text start="29.699" dur="8.04">Brazil with Randy Clark and to minister</text>
  <text start="34.23" dur="5.579">down there and my prayer before I went</text>
  <text start="37.739" dur="4.171">was that God would open my eyes to see</text>
  <text start="39.809" dur="3.601">in the realm of the Spirit to see beyond</text>
  <text start="41.91" dur="4.62">the natural realm to see things from</text>
  <text start="43.41" dur="6.44">God&amp;#39;s perspective and to see the</text>
  <text start="46.53" dur="6.509">Ministry of angels we got down there and</text>
  <text start="49.85" dur="7">in one of the meetings a presence of God</text>
  <text start="53.039" dur="6.631">was incredibly strong I had never been</text>
  <text start="56.85" dur="9.449">in such intense worship in my life to</text>
  <text start="59.67" dur="11.34">that point and God opened my eyes and I</text>
  <text start="66.299" dur="7.411">saw angels on the platform on several</text>
  <text start="71.01" dur="4.44">occasions I saw worshipping angels above</text>
  <text start="73.71" dur="3.21">the platform in fact they were here this</text>
  <text start="75.45" dur="3.87">morning and they were here across the</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="8.76">front there were three large worshipping</text>
  <text start="79.32" dur="8.58">angels it was beautiful and while I was</text>
  <text start="85.68" dur="3.899">while I was basking in that and what God</text>
  <text start="87.9" dur="5.85">had just done as I was crying out for</text>
  <text start="89.579" dur="5.821">more of him God took me up that&amp;#39;s a long</text>
  <text start="93.75" dur="5.75">process and I don&amp;#39;t have time to go into</text>
  <text start="95.4" dur="7.77">all of that but ultimately I ended up in</text>
  <text start="99.5" dur="6.43">the presence of the Lord and Jesus came</text>
  <text start="103.17" dur="5.4">and he took my hand and and he held my</text>
  <text start="105.93" dur="7.799">hand really tight my hand started</text>
  <text start="108.57" dur="8.31">burning the next day I had another</text>
  <text start="113.729" dur="6.721">encounter with the Lord I had two</text>
  <text start="116.88" dur="8.55">out-of-body experiences in two days I</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="6.84">was totally wasted I was ruined that</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="6">continued from that time on I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="127.29" dur="9.19">several other similar occurrences</text>
  <text start="131.43" dur="7.119">and this morning many of you will have</text>
  <text start="136.48" dur="6.509">your eyes opened to see the Ministry of</text>
  <text start="138.549" dur="6.81">angels as well we want to talk about the</text>
  <text start="142.989" dur="5.131">relationship between angels and healing</text>
  <text start="145.359" dur="9.8">and if you have your Bible turn with me</text>
  <text start="148.12" dur="12.72">to John chapter 5 John chapter 5 and I</text>
  <text start="155.159" dur="12.011">want to begin reading in verse 1 John</text>
  <text start="160.84" dur="8.28">chapter 5 verse 1 now after these things</text>
  <text start="167.17" dur="7.11">there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus</text>
  <text start="169.12" dur="6.959">went up to Jerusalem and now there is in</text>
  <text start="174.28" dur="6.03">Jerusalem by the Sheep gate a pool which</text>
  <text start="176.079" dur="7.201">is called in Hebrew basada having five</text>
  <text start="180.31" dur="5.789">porticoes and in these lay a multitude</text>
  <text start="183.28" dur="5.01">of those who were sick blind lame and</text>
  <text start="186.099" dur="4.86">withered waiting for the moving of the</text>
  <text start="188.29" dur="4.589">waters for an angel the Lord went down</text>
  <text start="190.959" dur="5.84">at certain seasons into the pool and</text>
  <text start="192.879" dur="7.381">stirred up the water whoever then first</text>
  <text start="196.799" dur="6.011">after after the stirring up of the water</text>
  <text start="200.26" dur="5.46">stepped in was made well and from</text>
  <text start="202.81" dur="7.319">whatever disease with which he was</text>
  <text start="205.72" dur="8.699">afflicted now we see in this passage the</text>
  <text start="210.129" dur="9.36">work of an angel producing healing for</text>
  <text start="214.419" dur="7.88">the sick who entered the water angels</text>
  <text start="219.489" dur="6.661">have played a significant part in doing</text>
  <text start="222.299" dur="7.36">the will of God in bringing healing to a</text>
  <text start="226.15" dur="5.729">lot of people my wife and I both have</text>
  <text start="229.659" dur="4.381">seen the Ministry of angels as they</text>
  <text start="231.879" dur="4.11">brought healing to people in fact the</text>
  <text start="234.04" dur="5.819">very first time I saw an angel minister</text>
  <text start="235.989" dur="5.731">healing like that was in Rio it was that</text>
  <text start="239.859" dur="4.44">three years ago on that very trip I</text>
  <text start="241.72" dur="5.879">forgot had opened my eyes I was asked to</text>
  <text start="244.299" dur="4.94">go back into the pastor&amp;#39;s office to pray</text>
  <text start="247.599" dur="4.23">for a man that was dying of brain cancer</text>
  <text start="249.239" dur="4.93">he was about seventy-five years old he</text>
  <text start="251.829" dur="3.9">had surgery the doctors said there was</text>
  <text start="254.169" dur="3.901">nothing more that they could do he had a</text>
  <text start="255.729" dur="4.35">short time to live and he and his wife</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="3.63">went with us into the back and the</text>
  <text start="260.079" dur="3.45">pastor gave me a bottle of anointing oil</text>
  <text start="261.7" dur="3.2">and when he did he told me that this man</text>
  <text start="263.529" dur="3.081">and his wife didn&amp;#39;t know geez</text>
  <text start="264.9" dur="4.59">and I thought this would be a great</text>
  <text start="266.61" dur="5.16">opportunity so I took the bottle of</text>
  <text start="269.49" dur="5.67">anointing oil I I cut my hand like that</text>
  <text start="271.77" dur="4.92">and I poured it into my hand and I took</text>
  <text start="275.16" dur="4.86">my hand and I put it on his head like</text>
  <text start="276.69" dur="4.65">that it started raining this bald-headed</text>
  <text start="280.02" dur="4.41">you know just a little hair around the</text>
  <text start="281.34" dur="5.43">edges the all started dripping off of</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="4.05">his face off his eyebrows off his ears</text>
  <text start="286.77" dur="3.03">down his nose dripping all over his</text>
  <text start="288.48" dur="3.33">shoulder and I thought oh no I really</text>
  <text start="289.8" dur="3.69">messed up on this one you know this guy</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="4.32">would probably wonder what no were they</text>
  <text start="293.49" dur="4.38">doing to me but you know it didn&amp;#39;t seem</text>
  <text start="296.13" dur="3.09">to bother him at all he was so desperate</text>
  <text start="297.87" dur="5.04">for healing he was willing to put up</text>
  <text start="299.22" dur="9.48">with anything as we continue to pray for</text>
  <text start="302.91" dur="7.979">him to my right a large angel put his</text>
  <text start="308.7" dur="5.189">wings out and around the man like this</text>
  <text start="310.889" dur="6.961">and just held him and I looked at that</text>
  <text start="313.889" dur="5.551">and it was so tender and as I looked</text>
  <text start="317.85" dur="4.35">again on the other side of that angel</text>
  <text start="319.44" dur="6.36">was a smaller angel this angel was</text>
  <text start="322.2" dur="5.73">blowing fire into the man&amp;#39;s head and I I</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="4.59">took another look at that it looked like</text>
  <text start="327.93" dur="7.56">a blowtorch of fire going from that</text>
  <text start="330.39" dur="6.42">angel right into the man&amp;#39;s head and I</text>
  <text start="335.49" dur="5.82">said wait a minute</text>
  <text start="336.81" dur="7.68">I asked him are you feeling anything is</text>
  <text start="341.31" dur="6.63">anything happening right now and he said</text>
  <text start="344.49" dur="4.89">oh yes my head my head it so hot he said</text>
  <text start="347.94" dur="8.94">my head&amp;#39;s burning up it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="349.38" dur="11.58">fire and I said well duh then he said</text>
  <text start="356.88" dur="6.15">I&amp;#39;m healed I&amp;#39;m healed and I said praise</text>
  <text start="360.96" dur="3.99">God I said now I want you to go to the</text>
  <text start="363.03" dur="4.41">doctor and get a medical verification of</text>
  <text start="364.95" dur="4.29">the healing I don&amp;#39;t need to I don&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="367.44" dur="3.84">to I&amp;#39;m healed I know I&amp;#39;m healed I know</text>

  <text start="373.65" dur="5.61">the doctor to verify the healing a</text>

  <text start="379.26" dur="2.61">okay okay I will I will</text>

  <text start="381.87" dur="6.93">reminded me that that that they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="384.99" dur="5.67">know Jesus and so I gave them a just a</text>

  <text start="1076.93" dur="10.05">really missing out on something and that</text>
  <text start="1082.81" dur="7.02">began a search for more of the deep</text>
  <text start="1086.98" dur="4.58">things of God to be able to see in the</text>

  <text start="1769.149" dur="5.581">and I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna be denied so I I mean</text>
  <text start="1772.57" dur="6.359">it was one of those things I was going</text>
  <text start="1774.73" dur="6.899">to get it or die so the Lord did through</text>
  <text start="1778.929" dur="6.301">an impartation service with the same</text>
  <text start="1781.629" dur="6.361">people that had prayed for Gary I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1785.23" dur="5.37">know I had even received it actually I</text>
  <text start="1787.99" dur="5.429">just had had such a huge encounter with</text>
  <text start="1790.6" dur="6.779">the Lord and so the next night this was</text>
  <text start="1793.419" dur="6.661">also in Rio and the next night we were</text>
  <text start="1797.379" dur="5.361">in a Baptist Church that was not very</text>
  <text start="1800.08" dur="5.37">big but there were they were like</text>
  <text start="1802.74" dur="3.34">gathered all around and the place was</text>
  <text start="1805.45" dur="3.24">packed</text>
  <text start="1806.08" dur="5.549">I mean packed it was packed up to the</text>
  <text start="1808.69" dur="6.54">stage packed on the stage every square</text>
  <text start="1811.629" dur="7.41">inch of place in that building was full</text>
  <text start="1815.23" dur="6.63">of people they wouldn&amp;#39;t allow it here in</text>
  <text start="1819.039" dur="4.74">Canada or the United States but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1821.86" dur="5.25">in the third world they don&amp;#39;t have fire</text>
  <text start="1823.779" dur="5.88">marshals I guess anyway um I was</text>
  <text start="1827.11" dur="7.61">standing on the stage Randy was speaking</text>
  <text start="1829.659" dur="7.77">and I looked up in the balcony and I</text>
  <text start="1834.72" dur="4.419">looked behind this lady and all of a</text>
  <text start="1837.429" dur="6.48">sudden my eyes were open and I saw an</text>
  <text start="1839.139" dur="7.38">angel behind her and he had asked the</text>
  <text start="1843.909" dur="4.59">ones that were feeling the touch of God</text>
  <text start="1846.519" dur="2.761">to stand up this was when this was</text>
  <text start="1848.499" dur="3.601">happening</text>
  <text start="1849.28" dur="4.62">so I was looking at that lady and I was</text>
  <text start="1852.1" dur="4.59">thinking there&amp;#39;s an angel behind her</text>
  <text start="1853.9" dur="6.21">she&amp;#39;s gonna stand up and so sure enough</text>
  <text start="1856.69" dur="6.18">up she stood and I was sits in an extra</text>
  <text start="1860.11" dur="5.49">gala on the platform who was from I was</text>
  <text start="1862.87" dur="4.53">Brazilian but from Southern California</text>
  <text start="1865.6" dur="3.72">and I said that lady&amp;#39;s going to get</text>
  <text start="1867.4" dur="4.35">healed tonight because there&amp;#39;s an angel</text>
  <text start="1869.32" dur="4.74">behind her I see an angel behind her now</text>
  <text start="1871.75" dur="4.8">this was a new experience for me so I</text>
  <text start="1874.06" dur="4.89">was testing the waters I mean it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1876.55" dur="5.76">like I just saw a physical human being</text>
  <text start="1878.95" dur="7.59">standing up there behind her it was like</text>
  <text start="1882.31" dur="7.44">I saw like a transparency over reality</text>
  <text start="1886.54" dur="6.9">does that make sense it&amp;#39;s like I could</text>
  <text start="1889.75" dur="6.6">see through it but it was there and so I</text>
  <text start="1893.44" dur="5.4">I said she&amp;#39;s going to be healed tonight</text>
  <text start="1896.35" dur="5.36">and there was another lady from that</text>
  <text start="1898.84" dur="5.25">church standing right beside her and she</text>
  <text start="1901.71" dur="4.69">understood a little bit of English and</text>
  <text start="1904.09" dur="4.05">she saw me pointing at her and pointing</text>
  <text start="1906.4" dur="5.25">at her well all of a sudden this lady</text>
  <text start="1908.14" dur="5.22">goes come on down to this lady she gets</text>
  <text start="1911.65" dur="3.78">hurt because this is not a big church</text>
  <text start="1913.36" dur="5.88">but she&amp;#39;s in the balcony and we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="1915.43" dur="5.49">the stage and so she turned to the lady</text>
  <text start="1919.24" dur="3.6">from Southern California and said in</text>
  <text start="1920.92" dur="6.51">Portuguese that lady&amp;#39;s the head</text>
  <text start="1922.84" dur="7.68">intercessor in this church so she came</text>
  <text start="1927.43" dur="7.53">on down and I met her behind stage and</text>
  <text start="1930.52" dur="7.14">God healed her but not only that there</text>
  <text start="1934.96" dur="6.21">was a huge sea of people and so when the</text>
  <text start="1937.66" dur="6.3">ministry team was released every person</text>
  <text start="1941.17" dur="6.72">I saw an angel behind indicated a relief</text>
  <text start="1943.96" dur="6.15">of pain or a healing that night it was</text>
  <text start="1947.89" dur="4.77">like just instant now you have to</text>
  <text start="1950.11" dur="5.36">understand I haven&amp;#39;t been known for</text>
  <text start="1952.66" dur="6.27">having a huge physical healing anointing</text>
  <text start="1955.47" dur="6.85">so this was something that the Lord did</text>
  <text start="1958.93" dur="5.4">to meet me and I knew when I had the</text>
  <text start="1962.32" dur="4.74">Ange saw the angel behind that person</text>
  <text start="1964.33" dur="7.26">would be healed makes it easy when you</text>
  <text start="1967.06" dur="6.63">see and so then it went on time went on</text>
  <text start="1971.59" dur="3.9">and I began to see this happening in</text>
  <text start="1973.69" dur="3.57">other meetings I just see people</text>
  <text start="1975.49" dur="5.62">standing and all of a sudden I&amp;#39;d see an</text>
  <text start="1977.26" dur="8.47">angel behind him well the next</text>
  <text start="1981.11" dur="8.67">time we went back to Rio we were in an</text>
  <text start="1985.73" dur="6">auditorium and I people came forward for</text>
  <text start="1989.78" dur="5.13">prayer and a lady came forward a young</text>
  <text start="1991.73" dur="6.78">girl probably about 23 years old and she</text>
  <text start="1994.91" dur="5.76">had had a four step delivery and it had</text>
  <text start="1998.51" dur="4.14">damaged her shoulder and her arm so her</text>
  <text start="2000.67" dur="5.37">shoulder and her arm never developed</text>
  <text start="2002.65" dur="6.69">properly it was like drooped and her arm</text>
  <text start="2006.04" dur="6.21">was smaller and not very much used to</text>
  <text start="2009.34" dur="5.4">her so she came forward for praying and</text>
  <text start="2012.25" dur="4.5">I prayed for and I was getting nowhere</text>
  <text start="2014.74" dur="4.47">there was nothing was happening until I</text>
  <text start="2016.75" dur="5.16">spoke to the trauma done to her body</text>
  <text start="2019.21" dur="6.18">when I spoke to the trauma and released</text>
  <text start="2021.91" dur="5.55">the trauma she started feeling heat now</text>
  <text start="2025.39" dur="3.78">the heats significant I felt like</text>
  <text start="2027.46" dur="3.69">because sometimes when the Angels</text>
  <text start="2029.17" dur="4.05">minister healing there&amp;#39;s a lot of heat</text>
  <text start="2031.15" dur="4.95">and then God opened my eyes and I could</text>
  <text start="2033.22" dur="5.34">see the angel behind her and suddenly</text>
  <text start="2036.1" dur="4.98">her arms started going in all these</text>
  <text start="2038.56" dur="4.89">different directions and she was</text>
  <text start="2041.08" dur="5.13">standing there the rest of her was stick</text>
  <text start="2043.45" dur="5.969">straight she was like in a trance her</text>
  <text start="2046.21" dur="7.199">eyes were closed and her arm was doing</text>
  <text start="2049.419" dur="6.841">all kinds of gyrations like this and she</text>
  <text start="2053.409" dur="6.031">goes I&amp;#39;m not doing this I&amp;#39;m not doing</text>
  <text start="2056.26" dur="8.28">this through an interpreter I I can&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="2059.44" dur="8.61">this I can&amp;#39;t do this she said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2064.54" dur="6.51">something taking my arm and so all of a</text>
  <text start="2068.05" dur="6.57">sudden I saw the Angels hand on her</text>
  <text start="2071.05" dur="6.21">wrist and her elbow and I said do you</text>
  <text start="2074.62" dur="5.88">feel anything on your arm and she said</text>
  <text start="2077.26" dur="7.56">yes yes I feel hands on my wrist in my</text>
  <text start="2080.5" dur="7.08">elbow and this went on for 45 minutes i</text>
  <text start="2084.82" dur="6.27">sat there and watched this angel</text>
  <text start="2087.58" dur="6.81">manipulate her arm and this little</text>
  <text start="2091.09" dur="5.19">pastor kept running up to me like a</text>
  <text start="2094.39" dur="4.98">little bee and trying to get my</text>
  <text start="2096.28" dur="5.43">attention and I kept saying no no I was</text>
  <text start="2099.37" dur="4.52">intent on what was going on and I wanted</text>
  <text start="2101.71" dur="5.16">to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t miss anything and</text>
  <text start="2103.89" dur="4.84">so they started to turn out the lights</text>
  <text start="2106.87" dur="6.36">and I had pushed him away about three</text>
  <text start="2108.73" dur="5.91">times and so we had to stop the process</text>
  <text start="2113.23" dur="4.349">that was still going on</text>
  <text start="2114.64" dur="4.35">and I measured her arm and her arms were</text>
  <text start="2117.579" dur="3.931">both the same size</text>
  <text start="2118.99" dur="6.299">she had mobility back again and her</text>
  <text start="2121.51" dur="6.12">shoulder it filled out and so the next</text>
  <text start="2125.289" dur="6.06">night this little pastor came running up</text>
  <text start="2127.63" dur="7.01">to me and he said through my interpreter</text>
  <text start="2131.349" dur="5.791">I was sitting on the stage and he said I</text>
  <text start="2134.64" dur="5.709">want to talk to you about angels and</text>
  <text start="2137.14" dur="6.57">healing he said last night I saw that</text>
  <text start="2140.349" dur="5.43">angel manipulating that girl&amp;#39;s arm so he</text>
  <text start="2143.71" dur="4.109">saw it to Anne in intrigued him so much</text>
  <text start="2145.779" dur="6.421">he was trying to put the two together</text>
  <text start="2147.819" dur="6.121">and so one other quick testimony that</text>
  <text start="2152.2" dur="4.29">was really amazing it was in a</text>
  <text start="2153.94" dur="4.169">conference we were in and I was standing</text>
  <text start="2156.49" dur="3.66">up in the front and all of a sudden I</text>
  <text start="2158.109" dur="5.851">saw an angel behind a man on this side</text>
  <text start="2160.15" dur="5.85">and I&amp;#39;ve learned by that time to go if I</text>
  <text start="2163.96" dur="6.21">see them I go and do what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="2166" dur="6.66">I cooperate with what I&amp;#39;m seeing so I</text>
  <text start="2170.17" dur="4.109">ran back I put my hand on his head and</text>
  <text start="2172.66" dur="4.23">then I saw the angel blow on his head</text>
  <text start="2174.279" dur="5.461">three times and I blew on his head three</text>
  <text start="2176.89" dur="5.58">times and I&amp;#39;ve done some pretty odd</text>
  <text start="2179.74" dur="6.9">things because of what I&amp;#39;ve seen but</text>
  <text start="2182.47" dur="6.089">it&amp;#39;s worked so anyway I blew in his head</text>
  <text start="2186.64" dur="4.53">three times and he starts going into</text>
  <text start="2188.559" dur="5.571">convulsions I mean just convulsions he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2191.17" dur="5.28">laying like this diagonally across the</text>
  <text start="2194.13" dur="5.679">chair stiff as a board</text>
  <text start="2196.45" dur="5.7">and shaking like crazy and he&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="2199.809" dur="4.47">and on well because of the angel behind</text>
  <text start="2202.15" dur="5.25">him the guy behind him was getting it</text>
  <text start="2204.279" dur="4.951">and he was he was getting healing like</text>
  <text start="2207.4" dur="3.84">there was a healing angel there so there</text>
  <text start="2209.23" dur="3.93">was a spillover and people were running</text>
  <text start="2211.24" dur="3.869">up and I was putting my hands on them</text>
  <text start="2213.16" dur="3.869">and they were getting it well this went</text>
  <text start="2215.109" dur="4.531">on for quite a while but I kept my hand</text>
  <text start="2217.029" dur="5.25">on his head and I couldn&amp;#39;t get a word</text>
  <text start="2219.64" dur="4.709">out of his wife I could knew nothing</text>
  <text start="2222.279" dur="6.901">about what was wrong with him nothing</text>
  <text start="2224.349" dur="7.26">and so finally I turned to him</text>
  <text start="2229.18" dur="5.609">he kind of calmed down and I said what</text>
  <text start="2231.609" dur="5.641">was wrong what is wrong that you needed</text>
  <text start="2234.789" dur="5.07">healing and he said I had shock</text>
  <text start="2237.25" dur="3.72">treatments three years ago and I lost</text>
  <text start="2239.859" dur="4.141">who I was</text>
  <text start="2240.97" dur="5.67">I lost my personality I got thoughts in</text>
  <text start="2244" dur="4.079">my brain that weren&amp;#39;t mine he said all I</text>
  <text start="2246.64" dur="4.5">can tell you tonight</text>
  <text start="2248.079" dur="5.4">when you touched my head I felt my brain</text>
  <text start="2251.14" dur="11.909">cells being rearranged and I got my</text>
  <text start="2253.479" dur="12.33">personhood back tonight it&amp;#39;s a time when</text>
  <text start="2263.049" dur="5.851">the when the heavenlies are breaking</text>
  <text start="2265.809" dur="7.26">into the physical realm and when we</text>
  <text start="2268.9" dur="6.599">begin to cooperate and we see what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2273.069" dur="5.67">happening and our motives are pure and</text>
  <text start="2275.499" dur="6.54">we do what we see we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="2278.739" dur="6.12">heaven invade Earth as we have seen all</text>
  <text start="2282.039" dur="5.31">over the world and it&amp;#39;s an exciting time</text>

  <text start="2290.259" dur="3.42">same thing at all</text>
  <text start="2291.4" dur="5.189">and I think our paradigm is going to be</text>
  <text start="2293.679" dur="5.79">changing much more in the future I think</text>
  <text start="2296.589" dur="4.89">we&amp;#39;re just cracking the door right now I</text>
  <text start="2299.469" dur="4.681">think there&amp;#39;s going to be a whole</text>
  <text start="2301.479" dur="5.88">paradigm shift of ministry and the</text>
  <text start="2304.15" dur="5.819">structure of the church and the the</text>
