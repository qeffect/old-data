  <text start="149.109" dur="5.671">dream</text>
  <text start="150.7" dur="5.73">in probably 25 years where God actually</text>
  <text start="154.78" dur="3.179">came to me in a dream and said I want</text>
  <text start="156.43" dur="5.37">you to start praying for your patients</text>
  <text start="157.959" dur="5.821">and if you do I&amp;#39;ll heal them so at the</text>
  <text start="161.8" dur="5.79">time I didn&amp;#39;t actually believe in</text>
  <text start="163.78" dur="5.79">healing of miracles and so I reluctantly</text>
  <text start="167.59" dur="4.35">started praying with people and you know</text>

  <text start="232.239" dur="4.59">time this podcast is out you never know</text>
  <text start="235.12" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re going through a really busy time</text>
  <text start="236.829" dur="5.791">right now so we shut down our Facebook</text>
  <text start="239.59" dur="5.88">accounts temporarily because we are</text>
  <text start="242.62" dur="7.89">really pedal to the metal on this next</text>
  <text start="245.47" dur="8.73">book design the book is written the</text>
  <text start="250.51" dur="4.53">editing is done but there&amp;#39;s a lot more</text>
  <text start="254.2" dur="3.659">to it than that</text>
  <text start="255.04" dur="5.069">when we&amp;#39;re doing a print book we&amp;#39;ve got</text>
  <text start="257.859" dur="6.031">design work to do on the interior and</text>
  <text start="260.109" dur="9.991">the cover ya know when we&amp;#39;re doing the</text>
  <text start="263.89" dur="10.17">first book she spent gosh months going</text>
  <text start="270.1" dur="7.37">through Photoshop and InDesign documents</text>
  <text start="274.06" dur="6.06">flowing the the text in fitting at all</text>
  <text start="277.47" dur="4.39">getting everything to look right coming</text>
  <text start="280.12" dur="3.66">up with images for the cover design it</text>
  <text start="281.86" dur="2.61">was it&amp;#39;s a very very labor intensive</text>
  <text start="283.78" dur="3.27">process</text>
  <text start="284.47" dur="4.08">if you&amp;#39;ve never done book design you</text>
  <text start="287.05" dur="3.63">probably don&amp;#39;t have any appreciation for</text>
  <text start="288.55" dur="5.7">what goes into actually putting a book</text>
  <text start="290.68" dur="5.7">together and it&amp;#39;s a lot of work so the</text>
  <text start="294.25" dur="4.53">reason why I deactivated my Facebook</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="5.55">account is because the two of us are now</text>
  <text start="298.78" dur="7.68">gonna spend the next couple of weeks</text>
  <text start="301.93" dur="6.93">as she said with the pedal to the metal</text>
  <text start="306.46" dur="6.18">we spent the last two days just looking</text>
  <text start="308.86" dur="6.36">on iStockphoto and all these stock image</text>
  <text start="312.64" dur="6.03">websites trying to find images that</text>
  <text start="315.22" dur="5.31">might work for our next book actually</text>
  <text start="318.67" dur="4.74">two or three books because it&amp;#39;s going to</text>
  <text start="320.53" dur="4.8">be a series of books and so we&amp;#39;re trying</text>
  <text start="323.41" dur="4.71">to come up with some images that could</text>
  <text start="325.33" dur="6">be used for two or three books in a row</text>
  <text start="328.12" dur="5.55">and we&amp;#39;re literally going over hundreds</text>
  <text start="331.33" dur="3.75">and hundreds of images on her computer</text>
  <text start="333.67" dur="4.59">about my computer trying to find images</text>
  <text start="335.08" dur="5.64">are gonna work and we haven&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="338.26" dur="2.7">actually decided on the title yet have</text>
  <text start="340.72" dur="1.26">we</text>
  <text start="340.96" dur="5.69">yeah we&amp;#39;re having a little disagreement</text>
  <text start="341.98" dur="7.8">about that actually the the original</text>
  <text start="346.65" dur="5.35">concept was my top 100 craziest</text>
  <text start="349.78" dur="5.1">adventures with God and it was gonna be</text>
  <text start="352" dur="5.97">stories that my husband had compiled</text>
  <text start="354.88" dur="6.18">over the years a lot of healing</text>
  <text start="357.97" dur="5.42">experiences when he prayed with patients</text>
  <text start="361.06" dur="4.26">but there&amp;#39;s also testimonies of</text>
  <text start="363.39" dur="6.1">financial miracles that we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="365.32" dur="9.57">experienced healing of mechanical</text>
  <text start="369.49" dur="10.02">devices and cars oh yes so anyway the</text>
  <text start="374.89" dur="6.06">the book title I ended up saying well we</text>
  <text start="379.51" dur="5.04">gonna tell them where I got the title</text>
  <text start="380.95" dur="4.469">from I had a dream a few years ago where</text>
  <text start="384.55" dur="2.64">I was</text>
  <text start="385.419" dur="3.391">she and I were at a bookstore I think</text>
  <text start="387.19" dur="3.75">was at Barnes and Noble and we were on a</text>
  <text start="388.81" dur="3.51">book signing tour and I was carrying</text>
  <text start="390.94" dur="4.229">this book around in my hand that I had</text>
  <text start="392.32" dur="4.62">written and I was I looked at the cover</text>
  <text start="395.169" dur="5.341">of the book and then it covered the</text>
  <text start="396.94" dur="8.58">title was my top 100 craziest adventures</text>
  <text start="400.51" dur="6.87">with God so I I didn&amp;#39;t have a grid for</text>
  <text start="405.52" dur="6.75">writing books at the time I had never</text>
  <text start="407.38" dur="6.48">thought about being an author so it took</text>
  <text start="412.27" dur="3.39">me a while to figure out that God</text>
  <text start="413.86" dur="3.21">actually wanted me to write these</text>
  <text start="415.66" dur="2.6">stories down that I would be going</text>
  <text start="417.07" dur="5.02">through and I hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="418.26" dur="6.81">a lot of healing success at the time but</text>
  <text start="422.09" dur="6.46">the Lord was actually encouraging me to</text>
  <text start="425.07" dur="4.77">let me know I was gonna have a lot of</text>
  <text start="428.55" dur="4.86">breakthrough and some pretty amazing</text>
  <text start="429.84" dur="5.07">stories to share and I asked him one day</text>
  <text start="433.41" dur="4.26">if I could actually write a book like</text>
  <text start="434.91" dur="7.89">this and he said yes you can and if you</text>
  <text start="437.67" dur="6.72">write it people will buy it so we</text>
  <text start="442.8" dur="4.59">actually wrote the first book divine</text>
  <text start="444.39" dur="5.4">healing made simple even though I had a</text>
  <text start="447.39" dur="4.65">dream for the second book before I wrote</text>
  <text start="449.79" dur="5.46">the first book this is the one I had the</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="5.76">dream about and once we got going on the</text>
  <text start="455.25" dur="5.7">manuscript it turned into this very very</text>
  <text start="457.8" dur="5.01">long book that was going to be over 400</text>
  <text start="460.95" dur="3.99">pages long so we decided to split it</text>
  <text start="462.81" dur="4.29">into two volumes so we&amp;#39;re publishing</text>
  <text start="464.94" dur="4.62">Volume one coming up here in the next</text>
  <text start="467.1" dur="3.18">month hopefully and then we&amp;#39;ll publish</text>
  <text start="469.56" dur="3.57">mine too</text>
  <text start="470.28" dur="5.31">but I wanted to take the title from the</text>
  <text start="473.13" dur="4.95">book my top 100 craziest adventures with</text>
  <text start="475.59" dur="5.34">God and make that the literal title of</text>
  <text start="478.08" dur="4.41">the book and my wife is saying well not</text>
  <text start="480.93" dur="3.51">so fast mister we need to talk about</text>
  <text start="482.49" dur="3.3">this because she has to do the design</text>
  <text start="484.44" dur="4.11">work and she has to fit all these words</text>
  <text start="485.79" dur="5.49">in and then we realize that if we if we</text>
  <text start="488.55" dur="5.76">limited it to 100 stories we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="491.28" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;re limiting the number of stories we</text>
  <text start="494.31" dur="4.5">can tell and we&amp;#39;ve already got we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="497.16" dur="5.37">already have enough stories for two and</text>
  <text start="498.81" dur="6.72">a half books right now plus when you say</text>
  <text start="502.53" dur="6.81">this is my top 100 craziest adventures</text>
  <text start="505.53" dur="6.03">with God that also limits you to to this</text>
  <text start="509.34" dur="4.44">time period that these things have</text>
  <text start="511.56" dur="4.14">occurred and I said there are gonna be</text>
  <text start="513.78" dur="4.77">more crazy adventures and they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="515.7" dur="6.51">be over-the-top so we better be prepared</text>
  <text start="518.55" dur="6.18">to write more books and not consider</text>
  <text start="522.21" dur="4.71">this the top 100 because it won&amp;#39;t be in</text>
  <text start="524.73" dur="4.92">five years it won&amp;#39;t be in in two years I</text>
  <text start="526.92" dur="6.06">mean new things are always happening and</text>
  <text start="529.65" dur="6.42">God is always moving and so we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="532.98" dur="5.16">expecting to see a lot more crazy</text>
  <text start="536.07" dur="4.86">adventures we have a future we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="538.14" dur="5.52">have a lot more crazy adventures so I</text>
  <text start="540.93" dur="5.73">have had to give up on a lot of things I</text>
  <text start="543.66" dur="4.71">really wanted to hang on I wanted to</text>
  <text start="546.66" dur="2.17">hang on to the title of that book and I</text>
  <text start="548.37" dur="3.13">had to let</text>
  <text start="548.83" dur="6">it so changed the title already and as</text>
  <text start="551.5" dur="7.97">we were looking at images potential</text>
  <text start="554.83" dur="4.64">images for the cover of the next book I</text>
  <text start="560.01" dur="8.62">she we weren&amp;#39;t finding images that</text>
  <text start="562.69" dur="7.68">looked the way we wanted them to and and</text>
  <text start="568.63" dur="4.47">the title that we were working with</text>
  <text start="570.37" dur="6.71">didn&amp;#39;t go with the look that we were</text>
  <text start="573.1" dur="7.44">kind of going in the direction of so we</text>
  <text start="577.08" dur="5.86">had some discussions over this or</text>
  <text start="580.54" dur="6.48">disagreement or disagreements no</text>
  <text start="582.94" dur="8.7">arguments I don&amp;#39;t think no and she came</text>
  <text start="587.02" dur="6.78">up with kind of a retro design for the</text>
  <text start="591.64" dur="4.58">book cover that looks very very</text>
  <text start="593.8" dur="4.77">different from the kind of books</text>
  <text start="596.22" dur="5.77">Pentecostal and charismatic people are</text>
  <text start="598.57" dur="6.18">putting out nowadays if we actually end</text>
  <text start="601.99" dur="6.57">up going with this design it is going to</text>
  <text start="604.75" dur="6.18">be very very different it&amp;#39;s very old</text>
  <text start="608.56" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s very retro looking yeah it&amp;#39;s just a</text>
  <text start="610.93" dur="5.88">little quirky and it&amp;#39;s quirky and simple</text>
  <text start="613.33" dur="8.37">and it&amp;#39;s if we end up using this design</text>
  <text start="616.81" dur="7.17">it&amp;#39;s gonna be very Italy it will not fit</text>
  <text start="621.7" dur="4.95">in with the rest of the popular books</text>
  <text start="623.98" dur="5.28">that you might find on Amazon that are</text>
  <text start="626.65" dur="4.17">being written by Pentecostal and</text>
  <text start="629.26" dur="8.34">charismatic people alright people of any</text>
  <text start="630.82" dur="8.72">genre it&amp;#39;ll be but the but the cover</text>
  <text start="637.6" dur="5.58">design that she&amp;#39;s working on right now</text>
  <text start="639.54" dur="5.56">although it&amp;#39;s quirky it goes well with</text>
  <text start="643.18" dur="5.25">the title that we&amp;#39;re trying to work with</text>
  <text start="645.1" dur="6.78">so yeah so an interesting process we&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="648.43" dur="6.87">altered the title to my crazy adventure</text>
  <text start="651.88" dur="6.96">craziest adventures with God and it&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="655.3" dur="7.61">be volume 1 volume 2 volume 3 as time</text>
  <text start="658.84" dur="7.49">goes on and just using the word craziest</text>
  <text start="662.91" dur="7.51">you know I am I&amp;#39;m a graphic designer so</text>
  <text start="666.33" dur="6.91">to me the background and the art has to</text>
  <text start="670.42" dur="4.56">reflect something a little bit a little</text>
  <text start="673.24" dur="5.04">bit quirky though they have to find a</text>
  <text start="674.98" dur="6.24">crazy font right you have to I mean you</text>
  <text start="678.28" dur="4.34">can&amp;#39;t just be out there with a whole</text>
  <text start="681.22" dur="5.11">peaceful background</text>
  <text start="682.62" dur="9.36">and I&amp;#39;m so spiritual kind of looking for</text>
  <text start="686.33" dur="7.66">so we have made some concessions here</text>
  <text start="691.98" dur="6.29">well we&amp;#39;re not sure yet we&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="693.99" dur="10.83">designing we&amp;#39;re still experimenting yeah</text>
  <text start="698.27" dur="8.14">so want me to read an excerpt from the</text>
  <text start="704.82" dur="4.02">next book sure</text>

  <text start="767.82" dur="4.53">tearjerker I&amp;#39;m gonna be quite honest</text>
  <text start="770.46" dur="4.44">with you I have read this manuscript</text>
  <text start="772.35" dur="4.5">over and over and over and I read I</text>
  <text start="774.9" dur="4.83">wrote some of these stories three or</text>
  <text start="776.85" dur="5.43">four years ago and in the process of</text>
  <text start="779.73" dur="3.99">writing them and editing them I still</text>
  <text start="782.28" dur="4.05">get teary-eyed when I read them even</text>
  <text start="783.72" dur="5.31">though I&amp;#39;ve read them like 10 times they</text>

  <text start="818.45" dur="3.52">then here you go</text>
  <text start="819.93" dur="4.68">My partner and I were trying to find</text>
  <text start="821.97" dur="5.07">some shade to park in between calls it</text>
  <text start="824.61" dur="5.01">was unusually hot day in North Dakota</text>
  <text start="827.04" dur="5.01">the temperature was close to 100 degrees</text>
  <text start="829.62" dur="3.99">I felt dry and thirsty and I was worried</text>
  <text start="832.05" dur="4.08">about getting dehydrated so I turned to</text>
  <text start="833.61" dur="4.08">my partner and said hey can you drive us</text>
  <text start="836.13" dur="3.96">to the Safeway so I can get a bottle of</text>
  <text start="837.69" dur="4.86">Gatorade he drove us to the Safeway and</text>
  <text start="840.09" dur="5.28">parked the ambulance I got out and went</text>
  <text start="842.55" dur="4.59">inside the air-conditioned store was a</text>
  <text start="845.37" dur="4.89">welcome change from the oppressive heat</text>
  <text start="847.14" dur="4.89">outside there was a cooler full of</text>
  <text start="850.26" dur="3.27">drinks near the checkout stand so I</text>
  <text start="852.03" dur="4.02">grabbed a bottle of Gatorade and went</text>
  <text start="853.53" dur="4.2">and took my place in line behind a</text>
  <text start="856.05" dur="4.98">middle-aged woman with blonde hair who</text>
  <text start="857.73" dur="4.89">was buying a bagel I&amp;#39;m not sure why but</text>
  <text start="861.03" dur="5.01">I looked down at the floor and I closed</text>
  <text start="862.62" dur="5.04">my eyes and my mind&amp;#39;s eye I saw an image</text>
  <text start="866.04" dur="4.11">of a middle-aged woman with blond hair I</text>
  <text start="867.66" dur="5.76">could clearly see the word headaches in</text>
  <text start="870.15" dur="6.36">white letters on a black background in</text>
  <text start="873.42" dur="4.77">this image that was in my mind I looked</text>
  <text start="876.51" dur="3.57">up and sure enough the woman behind the</text>
  <text start="878.19" dur="4.74">bagel was the same woman I saw in my</text>
  <text start="880.08" dur="5.82">mind&amp;#39;s eye I felt like the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="882.93" dur="5.4">had just told me that this woman in</text>
  <text start="885.9" dur="4.26">front of me had a migraine headaches so</text>
  <text start="888.33" dur="3.96">she paid for her bagel and she walked</text>
  <text start="890.16" dur="3.78">over toward the deli she was wearing a</text>
  <text start="892.29" dur="4.23">white uniform and she had on a black</text>
  <text start="893.94" dur="4.59">apron it was then that I realized that</text>
  <text start="896.52" dur="3.75">she was an employee of the store so I</text>
  <text start="898.53" dur="4.11">paid for my Gatorade and I followed her</text>
  <text start="900.27" dur="5.28">over to the deli I waited until she</text>
  <text start="902.64" dur="4.01">finished what was she was doing and then</text>
  <text start="905.55" dur="3.81">I got her attention</text>
  <text start="906.65" dur="6.16">and I basically said excuse me ma&amp;#39;am do</text>
  <text start="909.36" dur="6.09">you have a few minutes she said I sure</text>
  <text start="912.81" dur="5.25">do how can I help you I said I&amp;#39;m here to</text>
  <text start="915.45" dur="3.9">help you get rid of those headaches she</text>
  <text start="918.06" dur="4.17">looked at me and said how do you know</text>
  <text start="919.35" dur="5.03">about the my headaches she kept her face</text>
  <text start="922.23" dur="4.53">in her hands and she began sobbing I</text>
  <text start="924.38" dur="4.15">just said well I was standing in line</text>
  <text start="926.76" dur="3.63">behind you at the checkout stand and I</text>
  <text start="928.53" dur="3.62">closed my eyes and I saw a picture of</text>
  <text start="930.39" dur="4.56">you in my mind with the word headaches</text>
  <text start="932.15" dur="5.8">God loves you and I believe he wants to</text>
  <text start="934.95" dur="4.95">heal you so as tears were streaming down</text>
  <text start="937.95" dur="3.87">her cheeks she said you don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="939.9" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;ve had headaches for years and this</text>
  <text start="941.82" dur="3.69">morning I woke up with another one and</text>
  <text start="943.65" dur="3.51">as I was laying there in bed</text>
  <text start="945.51" dur="3.69">I wondered if God would ever heal me of</text>
  <text start="947.16" dur="3.58">them then you show up and tell me that</text>
  <text start="949.2" dur="4.24">he wants</text>
  <text start="950.74" dur="4.59">who are you and I said I guess I&amp;#39;m the</text>
  <text start="953.44" dur="2.82">guy that you sent to heal you is it okay</text>
  <text start="955.33" dur="4.68">if I pray with you</text>
  <text start="956.26" dur="5.43">she said yes of course it is so she</text>
  <text start="960.01" dur="3.24">walked around the deli counter and stood</text>
  <text start="961.69" dur="3.81">in front of me I placed my hands gently</text>
  <text start="963.25" dur="4.32">on her forehead I just said in Jesus</text>
  <text start="965.5" dur="4.38">name I command these headaches to leave</text>
  <text start="967.57" dur="5.37">right now spirit of pain I command you</text>
  <text start="969.88" dur="5.16">to leave I looked at her nametag and I</text>
  <text start="972.94" dur="3.87">said Oh her name&amp;#39;s Shelly Lord I bless</text>
  <text start="975.04" dur="4.5">your work of healing in Shelly&amp;#39;s life</text>
  <text start="976.81" dur="5.07">then I asked her how she felt with a</text>
  <text start="979.54" dur="4.86">look of astonishment she said it&amp;#39;s gone</text>
  <text start="981.88" dur="5.25">it&amp;#39;s completely gone I can&amp;#39;t believe it</text>
  <text start="984.4" dur="4.95">I don&amp;#39;t have any pain at all</text>
  <text start="987.13" dur="3.96">I was pretty dumbfounded actually I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="989.35" dur="5.19">never seen anyone miraculously healed</text>
  <text start="991.09" dur="5.28">before I&amp;#39;d prayed for hundreds of people</text>
  <text start="994.54" dur="3.9">over the years with almost no fruit to</text>
  <text start="996.37" dur="4.14">show for it but I couldn&amp;#39;t believe God</text>
  <text start="998.44" dur="5.13">actually helped healed someone that I</text>
  <text start="1000.51" dur="4.71">prayed for I gave Shelly a hug I gave</text>
  <text start="1003.57" dur="3.96">her a card to my website and I asked her</text>
  <text start="1005.22" dur="4.86">to keep in touch I wanted to know if the</text>
  <text start="1007.53" dur="4.26">headaches came back so grab my bottle of</text>
  <text start="1010.08" dur="3.74">Gatorade I said goodbye and I walked out</text>
  <text start="1011.79" dur="4.77">the door into the blistering heat</text>
  <text start="1013.82" dur="4.81">Shelly wrote about the encounter on her</text>
  <text start="1016.56" dur="5.25">own blog and this is her account of this</text>
  <text start="1018.63" dur="5.67">story she actually emailed me this story</text>
  <text start="1021.81" dur="4.77">from her blog about two or three weeks</text>
  <text start="1024.3" dur="4.35">later I&amp;#39;ve been having these extreme</text>
  <text start="1026.58" dur="3.69">headaches for a while I&amp;#39;d gone to the</text>
  <text start="1028.65" dur="3.27">doctor for them and he didn&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="1030.27" dur="4.319">was causing them I tried taking</text>
  <text start="1031.92" dur="5.789">ibuprofen and excedrin migraine for that</text>
  <text start="1034.589" dur="5.641">but nothing worked the morning before I</text>
  <text start="1037.709" dur="4.531">was in my quiet time with God trying to</text>
  <text start="1040.23" dur="4.95">read Matthew 13 the parable of the sower</text>
  <text start="1042.24" dur="5.28">after reading it I was asking God to let</text>
  <text start="1045.18" dur="3.87">his word fall in good soil since I</text>
  <text start="1047.52" dur="4.83">didn&amp;#39;t feel like I was a good Christian</text>
  <text start="1049.05" dur="5.34">I was sitting there and my head hurts so</text>
  <text start="1052.35" dur="3.78">bad and I remember telling God how much</text>
  <text start="1054.39" dur="4.2">my head hurt and I really couldn&amp;#39;t pray</text>
  <text start="1056.13" dur="4.11">it never occurred to me to ask for</text>
  <text start="1058.59" dur="5.34">healing because I felt I wasn&amp;#39;t worthy</text>
  <text start="1060.24" dur="5.58">to ask when I got to work I grabbed some</text>
  <text start="1063.93" dur="3.3">ibuprofen out of my person I took it</text>
  <text start="1065.82" dur="2.88">then I thought I&amp;#39;d better get myself a</text>
  <text start="1067.23" dur="4.91">bagel so this stuff doesn&amp;#39;t hurt my</text>
  <text start="1068.7" dur="6.42">stomach I went I was standing in line</text>

  <text start="1656.13" dur="5.91">for certain people no I will say this</text>
  <text start="1659.07" dur="5.28">people say well you know what about the</text>
  <text start="1662.04" dur="4.29">spiritual gifts there are spiritual</text>
  <text start="1664.35" dur="4.05">gifts of healing and gifts of miracles</text>
  <text start="1666.33" dur="4.38">and there&amp;#39;s a gift of prophecy and the</text>
  <text start="1668.4" dur="3.69">gift of tongues and some people you know</text>
  <text start="1670.71" dur="3.81">have one gift and some people have</text>
  <text start="1672.09" dur="5.94">another gift not everybody has the gift</text>
  <text start="1674.52" dur="7.32">of healing well you know what that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1678.03" dur="8.94">true in a sense and here&amp;#39;s how I how I</text>
  <text start="1681.84" dur="8.22">explained that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been taught for</text>
  <text start="1686.97" dur="5.13">years in the church at least this</text>
  <text start="1690.06" dur="4.5">section of church that believes in</text>
  <text start="1692.1" dur="4.5">spiritual gifts because a lot of the</text>
  <text start="1694.56" dur="4.23">church doesn&amp;#39;t but if you if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1696.6" dur="4.98">attending a church or you believe in</text>
  <text start="1698.79" dur="4.41">that the spiritual gifts are for this</text>
  <text start="1701.58" dur="6.78">current time period and they&amp;#39;re valid</text>
  <text start="1703.2" dur="8.76">for it&amp;#39;s a day and I do they&amp;#39;re one of</text>
  <text start="1708.36" dur="5.64">the misconceptions is that God only</text>
  <text start="1711.96" dur="3.84">gives one or two gifts to each person</text>
  <text start="1714" dur="6.3">and he doesn&amp;#39;t give all the gifts to</text>
  <text start="1715.8" dur="8.58">everyone I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think</text>
  <text start="1720.3" dur="5.64">that&amp;#39;s true because if you look at the</text>
  <text start="1724.38" dur="5.55">gifts and you look at the teaching in</text>
  <text start="1725.94" dur="7.74">first Corinthians on spiritual gifts it</text>
  <text start="1729.93" dur="7.38">basically teaches Paul teaches that the</text>
  <text start="1733.68" dur="8.73">spiritual gifts are distributed by the</text>
  <text start="1737.31" dur="9.72">Holy Spirit as he wills and to whom ever</text>
  <text start="1742.41" dur="6.66">he wants at any given time so it was</text>
  <text start="1747.03" dur="3.87">popular years ago to for people to try</text>
  <text start="1749.07" dur="2.22">to figure out what their spiritual gift</text>
  <text start="1750.9" dur="2.73">was</text>
  <text start="1751.29" dur="3.9">some people felt like they have only got</text>
  <text start="1753.63" dur="4.26">one gift from the Holy Spirit and that</text>
  <text start="1755.19" dur="4.2">was it some people thought well I have a</text>
  <text start="1757.89" dur="2.76">gift of tongues and that&amp;#39;s my gift and</text>
  <text start="1759.39" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s all I get I don&amp;#39;t get any other</text>
  <text start="1760.65" dur="7.41">gifts but the truth is anyone can</text>
  <text start="1764.79" dur="5.49">operate in the gift of tongues the truth</text>
  <text start="1768.06" dur="3.78">is anyone can operate in the discerning</text>

  <text start="1926.82" dur="6.989">build up and edify the church other</text>
  <text start="1929.49" dur="7.89">believers okay now think about this if</text>
  <text start="1933.809" dur="6">you&amp;#39;re out at a if you&amp;#39;re at a grocery</text>
  <text start="1937.38" dur="5.669">store and you&amp;#39;re talking to a group of</text>
  <text start="1939.809" dur="3.931">people who are not Christians who need</text>
  <text start="1943.049" dur="2.701">healing</text>
  <text start="1943.74" dur="3.929">you&amp;#39;re not going to be operating in the</text>
  <text start="1945.75" dur="4.409">gift of healing if they get healed</text>
  <text start="1947.669" dur="7.201">because they&amp;#39;re not believers and the</text>
  <text start="1950.159" dur="9.841">gift of healing is specifically for the</text>
  <text start="1954.87" dur="9.21">body of Christ it&amp;#39;s for believers so the</text>
  <text start="1960" dur="6.389">next question is well if if the gift of</text>
  <text start="1964.08" dur="3.78">healing doesn&amp;#39;t operate for</text>
  <text start="1966.389" dur="5.28">non-believers then how do you get those</text>
  <text start="1967.86" dur="7.26">people healed well this is where healing</text>
  <text start="1971.669" dur="8.61">in conjunction with the proclaiming the</text>
  <text start="1975.12" dur="8.419">gospel is used so if you read Luke 10</text>
  <text start="1980.279" dur="6.15">and Matthew 10 in those two chapters</text>
  <text start="1983.539" dur="5.831">Jesus Commission&amp;#39;s a twelve to go out</text>
  <text start="1986.429" dur="6">and the Commission who gives him is to</text>
  <text start="1989.37" dur="4.98">heal the sick raise the dead cleanse of</text>
  <text start="1992.429" dur="3.99">lepers cast out demons proclaim the</text>
  <text start="1994.35" dur="7.1">kingdom of God those are the things that</text>
  <text start="1996.419" dur="8.551">he told the disciples to do and he also</text>
  <text start="2001.45" dur="5.02">then told when that when the disciples</text>
  <text start="2004.97" dur="4.47">the twelve went out and did that they</text>
  <text start="2006.47" dur="5.04">came back everything was went great they</text>
  <text start="2009.44" dur="4.77">said Lord even the demons are subject to</text>
  <text start="2011.51" dur="4.919">us in your name and then he sent out the</text>
  <text start="2014.21" dur="3.54">seventy to do the same thing to heal the</text>
  <text start="2016.429" dur="4.831">sick raise the dead</text>
  <text start="2017.75" dur="7.32">demons so Jesus has commissioned his</text>
  <text start="2021.26" dur="6.18">disciples that&amp;#39;s you and me to heal the</text>
  <text start="2025.07" dur="3.72">sick raise the dead cast out demons if</text>
  <text start="2027.44" dur="5.66">you know any lepers you can get them</text>
  <text start="2028.79" dur="8.07">cleansed and proclaim the kingdom and</text>
  <text start="2033.1" dur="7.42">that is a commission that Jesus gave to</text>
  <text start="2036.86" dur="7.38">all disciples all believers of all ages</text>
  <text start="2040.52" dur="6.08">that is actually the only Commission</text>
  <text start="2044.24" dur="5.88">Jesus ever gave to his disciples</text>
  <text start="2046.6" dur="5.559">directly in the Great Commission Jesus</text>
  <text start="2050.12" dur="5.73">tells his disciples to obey all things</text>
  <text start="2052.159" dur="5.49">that I&amp;#39;ve commanded you and ask yourself</text>
  <text start="2055.85" dur="5.85">what did Jesus command his disciples to</text>
  <text start="2057.649" dur="6.961">do heal the sick raise the dead cast out</text>
  <text start="2061.7" dur="5.28">demons cleanse the lepers proclaim the</text>
  <text start="2064.61" dur="4.08">kingdom so in the Great Commission he</text>
  <text start="2066.98" dur="5.939">was reiterating what he had already</text>
  <text start="2068.69" dur="8.37">taught them to do so the truth is Jesus</text>
  <text start="2072.919" dur="7.441">has commissioned all of his believers in</text>
  <text start="2077.06" dur="5.91">all disciples for all ages to heal the</text>
  <text start="2080.36" dur="5.48">sick so you don&amp;#39;t need to really ask</text>
  <text start="2082.97" dur="5.699">yourself if you have the gift of healing</text>
  <text start="2085.84" dur="5.049">you don&amp;#39;t need to have the gift of</text>
  <text start="2088.669" dur="7.371">healing because you&amp;#39;ve been commissioned</text>
  <text start="2090.889" dur="8.011">by Jesus and given authority to to heal</text>
  <text start="2096.04" dur="6.01">one of the things jesus said to his</text>
  <text start="2098.9" dur="6.68">disciples was I give you authority over</text>
  <text start="2102.05" dur="6.99">all the power of the enemy that</text>
  <text start="2105.58" dur="6.45">authority that he gave us includes</text>
  <text start="2109.04" dur="8.22">authority over all forms of sickness</text>
  <text start="2112.03" dur="6.7">amen in Acts chapter one he said go to</text>
  <text start="2117.26" dur="3.6">Jerusalem and wait for the promise of</text>
  <text start="2118.73" dur="2.97">the Father you will be endued with power</text>
  <text start="2120.86" dur="2.79">from on high</text>
  <text start="2121.7" dur="5.27">when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and</text>
  <text start="2123.65" dur="5.96">that when the Holy Spirit comes upon us</text>
  <text start="2126.97" dur="5.68">when we were filled with the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="2129.61" dur="5.41">and God takes up residence his spirit</text>
  <text start="2132.65" dur="5.76">takes up residence inside of us we then</text>
  <text start="2135.02" dur="5.19">have all the power we need to heal the</text>
  <text start="2138.41" dur="3.96">sick so if you have the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="2140.21" dur="3.78">living inside of you you have all the</text>
  <text start="2142.37" dur="4.05">power you&amp;#39;ll ever need to heal the sick</text>
  <text start="2143.99" dur="4.29">and raise the dead you already have the</text>
  <text start="2146.42" dur="3.45">authority from Jesus to go out and heal</text>
  <text start="2148.28" dur="4.65">the sick so</text>
  <text start="2149.87" dur="4.83">this whole idea of people thinking I</text>
  <text start="2152.93" dur="4.77">need to have the gift of healing before</text>
  <text start="2154.7" dur="5.13">I can heal people is not true Jesus has</text>
  <text start="2157.7" dur="4.59">given us all authority and all the power</text>
  <text start="2159.83" dur="4.47">we need to go the city there&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="2162.29" dur="3.39">more we could talk about yeah but I</text>

  <text start="2290.62" dur="5.37">doing the inner healing inner healing</text>
  <text start="2292.57" dur="5.46">has become a big much bigger issue in</text>

  <text start="2309.04" dur="3.36">doing inner healing for a long time for</text>
  <text start="2311.32" dur="5.4">you some people were doing it for</text>
  <text start="2312.4" dur="6.39">decades we have noticed that and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2316.72" dur="6.93">just gonna give you my own personal</text>
  <text start="2318.79" dur="8.37">perspective on this it was around 2006</text>
  <text start="2323.65" dur="7.8">or 2007 when God really got ahold of a</text>
  <text start="2327.16" dur="7.71">key group of people like Tom Fisher and</text>
  <text start="2331.45" dur="6.51">Pete Cabrera and Todd white and Steve</text>
  <text start="2334.87" dur="5.61">Harmon and Hosea quello and turbans</text>
  <text start="2337.96" dur="4.14">Sondergaard and all these different</text>
  <text start="2340.48" dur="4.2">people from around the world and started</text>
  <text start="2342.1" dur="4.29">he brought forth this group of people</text>
  <text start="2344.68" dur="4.37">who most of them didn&amp;#39;t have a whole lot</text>
  <text start="2346.39" dur="4.74">of training and education you know and</text>
  <text start="2349.05" dur="3.97">but they went out and started doing a</text>
  <text start="2351.13" dur="3.39">lot of street healing we saw a lot of</text>
  <text start="2353.02" dur="5.79">people physically healed over the last</text>
  <text start="2354.52" dur="9.54">seven years or so I I have noticed I</text>
  <text start="2358.81" dur="8.34">think in 2014 that that I think God is</text>
  <text start="2364.06" dur="5.73">making a shift in emphasis and I think</text>
  <text start="2367.15" dur="5.55">he&amp;#39;s going to start teaching us a lot</text>
  <text start="2369.79" dur="4.29">more about emotional healing and inner</text>
  <text start="2372.7" dur="6.48">healing and I think we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="2374.08" dur="6.96">breakthrough in the next seven years in</text>
  <text start="2379.18" dur="5.9">aired the areas of mental illness</text>
  <text start="2381.04" dur="4.04">bipolar and schizophrenia and</text>
  <text start="2385.68" dur="4.48">dissociative identity disorder I think I</text>
  <text start="2388.57" dur="4.17">think that the Lord is shifting the</text>
  <text start="2390.16" dur="4.26">focus I think he has keys for healing</text>
  <text start="2392.74" dur="5.85">mental illness that he wants to give us</text>
  <text start="2394.42" dur="6.87">and I think as we pursue those things I</text>
  <text start="2398.59" dur="4.95">think we&amp;#39;re gonna see great breakthrough</text>
  <text start="2401.29" dur="3.63">the next seven years in the area of</text>
  <text start="2403.54" dur="3.9">healing mental illness and healing</text>
  <text start="2404.92" dur="3.63">emotional wounds so that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="2407.44" dur="3.06">that I think we&amp;#39;re gonna be talking a</text>
  <text start="2408.55" dur="3.96">lot more about in the future we&amp;#39;ll still</text>
  <text start="2410.5" dur="3.54">talk about physical healing but you know</text>
  <text start="2412.51" dur="3.72">honestly I think a lot of the people who</text>
  <text start="2414.04" dur="4.53">still have physical sin</text>
  <text start="2416.23" dur="5.19">items of illness and pain mm-hmm that</text>

  <text start="2423.76" dur="3.84">healed yeah absolutely</text>

  <text start="2432.24" dur="6.04">through Facebook and our personal</text>
  <text start="2434.83" dur="6.48">friends that God is really highlighting</text>
  <text start="2438.28" dur="5.28">this area right now in this moment in</text>
  <text start="2441.31" dur="4.95">time and so I think it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="2443.56" dur="6.98">important and it&amp;#39;s one it definitely is</text>
  <text start="2446.26" dur="4.28">one of the keys to physical healing</text>
