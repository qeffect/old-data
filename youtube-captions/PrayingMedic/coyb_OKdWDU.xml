  <text start="199.769" dur="7.381">know speaks to us all of us all the time</text>
  <text start="203.849" dur="7.11">and I wrote this book called hearing</text>
  <text start="207.15" dur="6.769">God&amp;#39;s voice made simple because after</text>
  <text start="210.959" dur="6.03">being an atheist for most of my life and</text>
  <text start="213.919" dur="5.77">then realizing that God is actually he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="216.989" dur="4.86">real and he speaks to people I thought</text>
  <text start="219.689" dur="6">holy moly people probably need to know</text>
  <text start="221.849" dur="5.371">about this so I wrote a book I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="225.689" dur="7.14">actually written several books but this</text>
  <text start="227.22" dur="9.06">is just one of them and this I do this</text>

  <text start="256.139" dur="4.5">chapters in divine healing wait simple</text>
  <text start="257.76" dur="4.319">now we are covering hearing God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="260.639" dur="6.691">made simple I think</text>
  <text start="262.079" dur="8.131">is a really key book for people who are</text>
  <text start="267.33" dur="6.78">curious to know is God actually speaking</text>
  <text start="270.21" dur="7.739">still speaking and if so how do I learn</text>
  <text start="274.11" dur="5.85">to hear his voice so that is what this</text>
  <text start="277.949" dur="3.571">series of messages is about this is</text>
  <text start="279.96" dur="4.56">going to cover the next probably the</text>
  <text start="281.52" dur="5.88">next year second Saturday of every month</text>
  <text start="284.52" dur="5.25">I&amp;#39;m gonna go through a chapter and this</text>
  <text start="287.4" dur="4.919">chapter this chapter - we did chapter</text>
  <text start="289.77" dur="4.949">one last one chapter two is so</text>
  <text start="292.319" dur="4.35">straightforward I could just read the</text>
  <text start="294.719" dur="3.901">chapter to you just right out of the</text>
  <text start="296.669" dur="3.601">book and it would make sense to you but</text>
  <text start="298.62" dur="6.449">I&amp;#39;m not gonna do that because that would</text>
  <text start="300.27" dur="7.649">be pretty boring alright so what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="305.069" dur="5.731">going to do instead is give you some</text>
  <text start="307.919" dur="8.521">illustrations all right when when I</text>
  <text start="310.8" dur="7.709">first became a Christian in 2000 I did I</text>
  <text start="316.44" dur="5.009">began going to this church it was it was</text>
  <text start="318.509" dur="4.861">a fundamentalist church taught the Bible</text>
  <text start="321.449" dur="3">and I went there for seven years and I</text>
  <text start="323.37" dur="2.729">learned the Bible I learned the</text>
  <text start="324.449" dur="4.291">scriptures really well inside and out</text>
  <text start="326.099" dur="4.38">forward and backward and learned all the</text>
  <text start="328.74" dur="3.359">books of the Bible I studied the</text>
  <text start="330.479" dur="5.101">scriptures like crazy</text>
  <text start="332.099" dur="6">in fact I and listened to a lot of</text>
  <text start="335.58" dur="5.549">calvary chapel pastors Chuck Smith Brian</text>
  <text start="338.099" dur="4.921">Brodeur s&amp;#39;en John a lot of other people</text>
  <text start="341.129" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s a lot of calvary chapel pastors</text>
  <text start="343.02" dur="6.859">good bible teachers taught the word and</text>
  <text start="344.849" dur="9.331">i learn the scriptures really well but</text>
  <text start="349.879" dur="7.69">in 2007 a lot of changes took place in</text>
  <text start="354.18" dur="5.22">my life and i ended up going to another</text>
  <text start="357.569" dur="7.951">church different church a charismatic</text>
  <text start="359.4" dur="9.75">church Assembly of God Church and I was</text>
  <text start="365.52" dur="7.44">I was blown away I quess just astounded</text>
  <text start="369.15" dur="6.9">because when you go to a fundamentalist</text>
  <text start="372.96" dur="4.859">church you pretty much just you know</text>
  <text start="376.05" dur="5.789">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a lot of biblical instruction</text>
  <text start="377.819" dur="8.431">and it&amp;#39;s foundational principles of the</text>
  <text start="381.839" dur="6.841">Bible and fundamentalists believe that</text>
  <text start="386.25" dur="4.38">they don&amp;#39;t really teach that the gifts</text>
  <text start="388.68" dur="3.419">of the Holy Spirit are active today they</text>
  <text start="390.63" dur="2.61">don&amp;#39;t really believe in healing they</text>
  <text start="392.099" dur="3.91">don&amp;#39;t believe in miracles they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="393.24" dur="5.769">really believe that God is even</text>
  <text start="396.009" dur="4.08">today they don&amp;#39;t believe in prophecy you</text>
  <text start="399.009" dur="2.4">know the gifts of the Spirit that are</text>
  <text start="400.089" dur="4.16">mentioned in first Corinthians which is</text>
  <text start="401.409" dur="4.71">a New Testament book by the way</text>
  <text start="404.249" dur="4.72">fundamentalist churches really don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="406.119" dur="3.78">teach on those things and so I did not</text>
  <text start="408.969" dur="2.491">believe in miracles</text>
  <text start="409.899" dur="4.22">I did not believe in healing it did not</text>
  <text start="411.46" dur="4.829">believe that God spoke currently</text>
  <text start="414.119" dur="4.3">fundamentalists teach here&amp;#39;s the Bible</text>
  <text start="416.289" dur="4.05">here&amp;#39;s a Word of God God spoke through</text>
  <text start="418.419" dur="3.45">the prophets and the apostles one time</text>
  <text start="420.339" dur="3.42">and that&amp;#39;s it he&amp;#39;s nuts he doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="421.869" dur="2.61">anything else to say he&amp;#39;s not speaking</text>
  <text start="423.759" dur="3.81">today</text>
  <text start="424.479" dur="6.33">that&amp;#39;s the fundamentalist teaching now</text>
  <text start="427.569" dur="6.451">that is what I had believed for seven</text>
  <text start="430.809" dur="6.121">years then I went to this charismatic</text>
  <text start="434.02" dur="5.759">church and I met a woman named melody</text>
  <text start="436.93" dur="6.329">pash I don&amp;#39;t even know if melody is on</text>
  <text start="439.779" dur="6.11">your hey Casa Cozine hey Kazik Oh our</text>
  <text start="443.259" dur="6.95">friend from Japan glad you could join us</text>
  <text start="445.889" dur="6.46">she was probably having some evening tea</text>
  <text start="450.209" dur="3.39">because it is evening in Japan should be</text>
  <text start="452.349" dur="6.15">getting ready to go to bed pretty soon</text>
  <text start="453.599" dur="7.21">so the thing about a charismatic church</text>
  <text start="458.499" dur="3.9">generally they believe in the gifts of</text>
  <text start="460.809" dur="3.271">the Spirit they believe in prophecy they</text>
  <text start="462.399" dur="4.74">believe in healing and miracles and</text>
  <text start="464.08" dur="6.53">things of that nature and melody pash</text>
  <text start="467.139" dur="5.7">came into this church that I was at and</text>
  <text start="470.61" dur="2.649">she did not know the people in the</text>
  <text start="472.839" dur="1.68">church</text>

  <text start="493.269" dur="5.911">row of people in the front row of the</text>
  <text start="494.86" dur="7.529">church telling them God&amp;#39;s heart for</text>

  <text start="523.899" dur="3">to know some of the people it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="525.04" dur="4.62">like when I first got there I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="526.899" dur="4.201">going to that church probably three or</text>
  <text start="529.66" dur="3.39">months and I got to know some of the</text>
  <text start="531.1" dur="3.419">people so I knew a lot of them I knew</text>

  <text start="548.829" dur="7.55">prophesying over probably two dozen</text>
  <text start="551.649" dur="8.971">people in the church and I was stunned I</text>

  <text start="560.62" dur="9.659">church service going what the hell was</text>
  <text start="563.92" dur="8.13">that that that woman knew all the secret</text>
  <text start="570.279" dur="4.98">things of those people&amp;#39;s lives somehow</text>
  <text start="572.05" dur="6.149">God was telling her all this stuff and I</text>
  <text start="575.259" dur="6.57">thought if this is real I want to learn</text>
  <text start="578.199" dur="8.37">how to do this well be careful what you</text>
  <text start="581.829" dur="8.161">ask for because you might get it</text>
  <text start="586.569" dur="6.75">I actually melody passed the reason I</text>
  <text start="589.99" dur="5.69">knew her was she was teaching a dream</text>
  <text start="593.319" dur="10.111">interpretation workshop and this was in</text>
  <text start="595.68" dur="9.909">2008 and she had Denise my wife had gone</text>

  <text start="619.569" dur="4.08">dreams and God will get start giving</text>
  <text start="621.819" dur="5.791">them dreams so Denise prayed over me</text>
  <text start="623.649" dur="7.68">that night I had my first dream in 25</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="6.599">years that night in the dream I met God</text>
  <text start="631.329" dur="5.671">and he told me I&amp;#39;m going to show you</text>
  <text start="634.209" dur="4.141">what&amp;#39;s wrong with your patience and when</text>
  <text start="637" dur="4.17">you pray for them I want you to pray for</text>
  <text start="638.35" dur="9.81">them and we need to I&amp;#39;ll heal them that</text>
  <text start="641.17" dur="11.82">was August 8th 2008 8 8 0 8 so we we had</text>
  <text start="648.16" dur="6.659">kind of a a an interesting relationship</text>
  <text start="652.99" dur="5.399">with melody she has taught me a lot</text>
  <text start="654.819" dur="6.481">about dreams she is a really amazingly</text>
  <text start="658.389" dur="4.651">gifted dream interpretation person she</text>
  <text start="661.3" dur="2.04">knows a lot about prophecy and hearing</text>
  <text start="663.04" dur="2.49">God</text>
  <text start="663.34" dur="4.17">boys she&amp;#39;s very gifted in that and I</text>
  <text start="665.53" dur="7.92">have studied under her and she&amp;#39;s taught</text>
  <text start="667.51" dur="7.74">me a lot anyway fast forward so I then</text>
  <text start="673.45" dur="6">at that point came to this realization</text>
  <text start="675.25" dur="6.41">that well dinging I was taught God isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="679.45" dur="5.4">still speaking but apparently he is</text>
  <text start="681.66" dur="6.43">because I had this dream and God clearly</text>
  <text start="684.85" dur="7.4">in in the dream God appeared as this</text>
  <text start="688.09" dur="6.96">bright light just this brilliant light</text>
  <text start="692.25" dur="6.31">it&amp;#39;s like looking into this you know the</text>
  <text start="695.05" dur="7.71">Sun or a star and I just this this voice</text>
  <text start="698.56" dur="6.21">was just speaking to me right so I had</text>
  <text start="702.76" dur="4.89">to admit that God is still speaking and</text>
  <text start="704.77" dur="4.83">if God is still speaking then I wanted</text>
  <text start="707.65" dur="3.63">to learn how to hear his voice and God</text>
  <text start="709.6" dur="3.21">speaks through many different ways he</text>
  <text start="711.28" dur="3.93">speaks through dreams he speaks through</text>
  <text start="712.81" dur="5.64">visions he speaks with that still small</text>
  <text start="715.21" dur="5.99">voice and we&amp;#39;re going to cover all these</text>
  <text start="718.45" dur="7.56">different ways in which God speaks but</text>

  <text start="951.279" dur="3.5">through the still small voice or the</text>
  <text start="953.05" dur="4.86">many different ways in which he speaks</text>
  <text start="954.779" dur="6.49">get get a good book or two and start</text>
  <text start="957.91" dur="8.25">reading and learn about the ways in</text>
  <text start="961.269" dur="7.651">which God speaks and look you know it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="966.16" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s just a number one the first step in</text>
  <text start="968.92" dur="5.21">learning to hear God&amp;#39;s voice is</text>
  <text start="970.93" dur="5.04">admitting that God is speaking and</text>
  <text start="974.13" dur="5.379">deciding that you want to hear what he</text>
  <text start="975.97" dur="4.979">has to say if you just stick your head</text>
  <text start="979.509" dur="5.13">in the sand and pretend God isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="980.949" dur="6.39">speaking to you he he will speak you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="984.639" dur="5.01">not going to discern here listen and</text>
  <text start="987.339" dur="5.43">understand what he&amp;#39;s saying God is</text>
  <text start="989.649" dur="7.971">speaking to everybody whether they know</text>
  <text start="992.769" dur="10.951">it or not he is speaking the question is</text>
  <text start="997.62" dur="9.13">well let me give an example let&amp;#39;s say</text>
  <text start="1003.72" dur="4.679">for instance you have a neighbor and the</text>
  <text start="1006.75" dur="4.8">neighbor has a dog that likes to bark</text>
  <text start="1008.399" dur="6.031">and every time a car drives by the house</text>
  <text start="1011.55" dur="5.43">the dog is barking and whenever a door</text>
  <text start="1014.43" dur="3.99">slams a dog is barking the dog just</text>
  <text start="1016.98" dur="4.62">barks a lot a lot of different things</text>
  <text start="1018.42" dur="4.979">and over the course of several years of</text>
  <text start="1021.6" dur="4.349">living in this house with this neighbor</text>
  <text start="1023.399" dur="6.3">dog barking you kind of learn to tune it</text>
  <text start="1025.949" dur="5.25">out like you&amp;#39;re still aware that the dog</text>
  <text start="1029.699" dur="3.691">is barking but you&amp;#39;re not really paying</text>
  <text start="1031.199" dur="2.671">attention to it right you just you tune</text>
  <text start="1033.39" dur="2.309">it out</text>
  <text start="1033.87" dur="6.299">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s there but it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1035.699" dur="6.72">something you focus on alright so then</text>
  <text start="1040.169" dur="3.66">one day a neighbor comes over or a</text>
  <text start="1042.419" dur="3.24">friend or a relative comes over and</text>
  <text start="1043.829" dur="4.26">you&amp;#39;re talking and the dog is barking</text>
  <text start="1045.659" dur="4.681">and your friend says hey doesn&amp;#39;t that</text>
  <text start="1048.089" dur="4.921">duck barking dog annoy you and you say</text>
  <text start="1050.34" dur="3.99">oh I just tuned that thing out I it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1053.01" dur="4.1">been barking for years I don&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="1054.33" dur="2.78">attention to anymore</text>
  <text start="1057.24" dur="5.04">it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the dog is not</text>
  <text start="1058.95" dur="5.52">barking the dog is still barking you</text>
  <text start="1062.28" dur="3.86">just have decided to tune it out I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1064.47" dur="4.29">going to listen to it I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="1066.14" dur="5.289">hear I&amp;#39;m not going to pay attention to</text>
  <text start="1068.76" dur="4.44">what that dog is doing I&amp;#39;m not saying</text>
  <text start="1071.429" dur="4.351">that the voice of God is like a dog</text>
  <text start="1073.2" dur="9.54">however if you reverse the letters dog</text>
  <text start="1075.78" dur="10.29">and God a lot of people hear God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="1082.74" dur="5.88">they hear his thoughts in their mind a</text>
  <text start="1086.07" dur="5.75">lot of people see visions in their mind</text>
  <text start="1088.62" dur="6.6">a lot of people have dreams they</text>
  <text start="1091.82" dur="5.08">perceive they revelation that God is</text>
  <text start="1095.22" dur="5.58">giving them but they&amp;#39;re not paying</text>
  <text start="1096.9" dur="7.2">attention to it they&amp;#39;re not taking the</text>
  <text start="1100.8" dur="7.5">time to learn what God is saying and</text>
  <text start="1104.1" dur="6.81">interpreting it they hear it they see it</text>
  <text start="1108.3" dur="7.64">they perceive it but they&amp;#39;re not paying</text>
  <text start="1110.91" dur="8.1">attention to it and the takeaway message</text>
  <text start="1115.94" dur="6.18">today is and this is the takeaway</text>
  <text start="1119.01" dur="7.23">message in every single chapter God is</text>
  <text start="1122.12" dur="7.75">speaking you are hearing perceiving</text>
  <text start="1126.24" dur="7.92">seeing what he&amp;#39;s saying the question is</text>
  <text start="1129.87" dur="7.91">are you understanding it are you taking</text>
  <text start="1134.16" dur="6.42">the time to sit down and understand and</text>
  <text start="1137.78" dur="4.6">interpret and unravel and connect the</text>
  <text start="1140.58" dur="5.64">dots of what God is saying because we&amp;#39;re</text>
