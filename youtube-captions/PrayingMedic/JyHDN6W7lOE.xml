  <text start="110.799" dur="7.201">snafu yesterday Denise and I were</text>
  <text start="113.77" dur="5.94">working on the edits and we ran into</text>
  <text start="118" dur="4.26">some font issues and so we had to</text>
  <text start="119.71" dur="5.85">purchase some fonts which were rather</text>
  <text start="122.26" dur="6.359">expensive but it&amp;#39;s part of the game when</text>
  <text start="125.56" dur="6.199">you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re an author you have to</text>
  <text start="128.619" dur="3.14">buy fonts and things like that</text>
  <text start="132" dur="5.049">we purchase these fonts just for the</text>
  <text start="134.56" dur="4.55">series of books so that the narrative</text>
  <text start="137.049" dur="3.251">text and the cue text will all look nice</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="5.45">next</text>
  <text start="140.3" dur="5.78">so anyway you&amp;#39;re probably wondering why</text>
  <text start="144.56" dur="4.94">I called you all here it&amp;#39;s in the title</text>
  <text start="146.08" dur="7.65">Andrew McCabe is going to be indicted</text>
  <text start="149.5" dur="8.89">we&amp;#39;ve just got this from Fox News and</text>
  <text start="153.73" dur="6.61">just give you a brief summary Fox News</text>
  <text start="158.39" dur="5.07">has learned from a source a person close</text>
  <text start="160.34" dur="5.82">to Andrew McCabe that the Department of</text>
  <text start="163.46" dur="7.14">Justice has declined</text>
  <text start="166.16" dur="8.19">McCabe&amp;#39;s last-minute appeal so their</text>
  <text start="170.6" dur="7.86">attorneys went as far as Deputy Attorney</text>
  <text start="174.35" dur="6.39">General Rosen to make an appeal to try</text>
  <text start="178.46" dur="4.98">to get the charges against him the</text>
  <text start="180.74" dur="5.13">pending charges dropped and Fox News is</text>
  <text start="183.44" dur="4.41">reporting that the charges are not going</text>
  <text start="185.87" dur="6.48">to dropped the Andrew cave is going to</text>
  <text start="187.85" dur="7.71">be indicted this is from Jesse Lu who is</text>
  <text start="192.35" dur="5.22">the US attorney in that district who is</text>
  <text start="195.56" dur="4.49">kind of a from what I understand a bit</text>
  <text start="197.57" dur="5.07">of a swamp dweller but he is going to</text>
  <text start="200.05" dur="4.51">proceed with charges against McCabe</text>
  <text start="202.64" dur="5.19">anyway so McKay will be charged now</text>
  <text start="204.56" dur="4.83">here&amp;#39;s the thing and two things I want</text>
  <text start="207.83" dur="4.26">to say we&amp;#39;re getting secondary</text>
  <text start="209.39" dur="4.65">confirmation from Chuck Ross Chuck Ross</text>
  <text start="212.09" dur="4.29">said he has talked to someone who was</text>
  <text start="214.04" dur="4.73">close to McCabe he is confirming that</text>
  <text start="216.38" dur="5.16">his sources confirm that story is true</text>
  <text start="218.77" dur="4.48">that they did receive a letter</text>
  <text start="221.54" dur="3.75">McCabe&amp;#39;s legal team received a letter</text>
  <text start="223.25" dur="4.29">from the DOJ saying his last minute</text>
  <text start="225.29" dur="5.82">appeal has been denied and he is going</text>
  <text start="227.54" dur="5.22">to be prosecuted so we know McCabe is</text>
  <text start="231.11" dur="5.76">going to be prosecuted we don&amp;#39;t know for</text>
  <text start="232.76" dur="8.43">what so here&amp;#39;s the thing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="236.87" dur="7.11">thinking and this is just suspicion then</text>
  <text start="241.19" dur="8.73">it may be related to the lies that he</text>
  <text start="243.98" dur="9.6">told when he told DOJ and FBI people he</text>
  <text start="249.92" dur="5.039">did not leak to the press information</text>
  <text start="253.58" dur="3.659">during about Hillary&amp;#39;s email</text>
  <text start="254.959" dur="4.381">investigation he leaked some information</text>
  <text start="257.239" dur="7.761">to Wall Street Journal reporter it went</text>
  <text start="259.34" dur="9.47">out in the DOJ inspector general report</text>
  <text start="265" dur="8.62">the first one that came out about McCabe</text>
  <text start="268.81" dur="7.63">he was accused of found to be dishonest</text>
  <text start="273.62" dur="4.08">leaked information and and that was</text>
  <text start="276.44" dur="4.53">actually part of the reason why he was</text>
  <text start="277.7" dur="6.9">fired he was fired for lying about the</text>
  <text start="280.97" dur="5.94">leaking leaking headline right so there</text>
  <text start="284.6" dur="3.57">is a suspicion that his charges are</text>
  <text start="286.91" dur="2.7">going to be related to that but we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="288.17" dur="2.79">know we don&amp;#39;t know what he&amp;#39;ll be charged</text>
  <text start="289.61" dur="2.52">with he could be charged with something</text>
  <text start="290.96" dur="3.81">much more serious than that</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="4.95">and I suspect if they&amp;#39;re going to bring</text>
  <text start="294.77" dur="5.73">charges they&amp;#39;re not they didn&amp;#39;t charge</text>
  <text start="297.08" dur="6.09">Comey with leaking because it&amp;#39;s very</text>
  <text start="300.5" dur="3.9">difficult to prove I suspect they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="303.17" dur="3.45">gonna charge McCabe with something</text>
  <text start="304.4" dur="3.93">probably more serious than that they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="306.62" dur="4.05">gonna bring charges against McCabe it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="308.33" dur="5.99">got to be something I would think a bit</text>
  <text start="310.67" dur="6.03">more serious and just lying or leaking</text>
  <text start="314.32" dur="5.38">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s not worth burning a lot of</text>
  <text start="316.7" dur="4.35">political capital on so we&amp;#39;ll just have</text>
  <text start="319.7" dur="5.16">to wait and see what the charges are</text>
  <text start="321.05" dur="6.87">gonna be we don&amp;#39;t know right now who</text>
  <text start="324.86" dur="5.34">will CNN firing that&amp;#39;s a good question</text>
  <text start="327.92" dur="4.71">CNN at the bottom of the Fox News</text>
  <text start="330.2" dur="6.78">article says CNN did not respond to</text>
  <text start="332.63" dur="6.36">requests for comment on that so now that</text>
  <text start="336.98" dur="3.3">McCain&amp;#39;s gonna be charged to CNN gonna</text>
  <text start="338.99" dur="5.88">keep in mind as their anchor we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="340.28" dur="6.57">know so for all of you who have been</text>
  <text start="344.87" dur="3.57">concerned that no one&amp;#39;s gonna be charged</text>
  <text start="346.85" dur="3.84">no one&amp;#39;s gonna be held accountable no</text>
  <text start="348.44" dur="4.44">one&amp;#39;s gonna be arrested we have our</text>
  <text start="350.69" dur="4.74">first scalp Andrew McCabe is gonna be</text>
  <text start="352.88" dur="6.14">charged and if McCabe is going to be</text>
  <text start="355.43" dur="6.9">charged that gives us a signal that the</text>
  <text start="359.02" dur="4.75">that the DOJ is looking at taking these</text>
  <text start="362.33" dur="3.06">people on and holding them accountable</text>
  <text start="363.77" dur="5.21">I would imagine Comey will also be</text>
  <text start="365.39" dur="6.51">charged eventually and if Co me and</text>
  <text start="368.98" dur="5.92">McCabe are gonna be charged James Baker</text>
  <text start="371.9" dur="4.52">will probably charged Strock and Paige</text>
  <text start="374.9" dur="3.78">will probably be charged</text>
  <text start="376.42" dur="4.63">McCabe will probably be the very first</text>
  <text start="378.68" dur="5.4">person in line because he had he had the</text>
  <text start="381.05" dur="4.98">most exposure in all this so I would</text>
  <text start="384.08" dur="4.35">anticipate we&amp;#39;re going to start seeing</text>
  <text start="386.03" dur="4.32">more people charged as time moves</text>
  <text start="388.43" dur="3.6">forward and this is just the first one I</text>
  <text start="390.35" dur="2.67">don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s gonna stop at McKim I</text>
  <text start="392.03" dur="3.41">think there are a lot of other people</text>
  <text start="393.02" dur="4.65">involved Brennan will eventually look</text>
  <text start="395.44" dur="4.78">everyone who knows anything about this</text>
  <text start="397.67" dur="4.44">Jodie Jenna and everyone else has been</text>
  <text start="400.22" dur="5.01">say you know this all leads back to</text>
  <text start="402.11" dur="4.98">Brennan that sucker is gonna get a will</text>
  <text start="405.23" dur="7.32">eventually figure out he was the one who</text>
  <text start="407.09" dur="8.79">started all this I mean kind of Brennan</text>
  <text start="412.55" dur="5.13">as a head of the CIA was responsible for</text>
  <text start="415.88" dur="3.96">a lot of the coordination and</text>
  <text start="417.68" dur="4.26">organization although ultimately the</text>
  <text start="419.84" dur="4.65">ultimate authority is Obama behind all</text>
  <text start="421.94" dur="6.06">of us right well no is it is at the top</text>
  <text start="424.49" dur="5.55">but Brennan Comey clapper they&amp;#39;re all</text>
  <text start="428" dur="3.18">probably equally involved so I would</text>
  <text start="430.04" dur="5.61">imagine all of them will probably charge</text>
  <text start="431.18" dur="6.69">at some point but for those of you who</text>
  <text start="435.65" dur="4.32">have been concerned and worried that no</text>
  <text start="437.87" dur="5.07">one&amp;#39;s gonna be held accountable we have</text>
  <text start="439.97" dur="6.62">now confirmation that our first deep</text>
  <text start="442.94" dur="7.62">state crook is going to be charged so</text>
  <text start="446.59" dur="5.4">that&amp;#39;s the news and I don&amp;#39;t have a whole</text>
  <text start="450.56" dur="4.53">lot more to report</text>
  <text start="451.99" dur="5.35">hñ is still offline</text>

  <text start="467.51" dur="5.25">probably start dropping again I would</text>
