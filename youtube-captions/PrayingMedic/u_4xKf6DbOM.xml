  <text start="140.03" dur="5.069">other people at various times tried to</text>
  <text start="143.42" dur="4.409">bring up articles of impeachment in the</text>

  <text start="151.549" dur="7.11">impeachment process and Nancy Pelosi for</text>
  <text start="155.54" dur="4.979">what it&amp;#39;s worth Nancy Pelosi has been</text>

  <text start="160.519" dur="4.711">Nancy Pelosi has been telling the</text>
  <text start="162.409" dur="5.521">Democrats shut up about impeachment stop</text>
  <text start="165.23" dur="5.22">it were not going to impeach Trump we</text>

  <text start="170.45" dur="5.429">crimes yeah it&amp;#39;s an actually dummy thing</text>
  <text start="173.09" dur="7.519">that is worthy of impeachment it is too</text>
  <text start="175.879" dur="6.801">tremendously unpopular among voters and</text>
  <text start="180.609" dur="4.75">particularly since the Muller</text>
  <text start="182.68" dur="5.05">investigation came up to be the big</text>
  <text start="185.359" dur="4.231">nothing murder prior to the Muller</text>
  <text start="187.73" dur="3.209">investigation there was some support in</text>
  <text start="189.59" dur="5.489">Congress and there was some support</text>
  <text start="190.939" dur="6.751">among their base to try to go forward</text>
  <text start="195.079" dur="4.5">with impeachment but since the Muller</text>
  <text start="197.69" dur="4.859">investigation was a nothing burger and</text>
  <text start="199.579" dur="4.44">they had really nothing on Trump that</text>
  <text start="202.549" dur="4.381">they could charge him with they couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="204.019" dur="6.15">charge him with obstruction the whole</text>
  <text start="206.93" dur="8.58">impeachment thing has gotten a lot less</text>
  <text start="210.169" dur="9.29">support until recently so now we had</text>
  <text start="215.51" dur="8.36">this whole thing with Ukraine and</text>
  <text start="219.459" dur="7.39">there&amp;#39;s this whistleblower complaint and</text>
  <text start="223.87" dur="5.41">the whistleblower evidently leaked to</text>
  <text start="226.849" dur="3.901">the media and of course the</text>
  <text start="229.28" dur="6.739">whistleblower didn&amp;#39;t hear the</text>
  <text start="230.75" dur="5.269">conversation that the President had with</text>
  <text start="236.319" dur="9.491">the Ukrainian president all right so</text>
  <text start="241.389" dur="7.5">what I&amp;#39;ve been watching is in a sense it</text>
  <text start="245.81" dur="5.94">looks like Trump has been baiting his</text>
  <text start="248.889" dur="6.55">opponents to make a big deal of this</text>
  <text start="251.75" dur="5.82">whistleblower thing to accuse him of</text>
  <text start="255.439" dur="6.48">wrongdoing to accuse him of corruption</text>
  <text start="257.57" dur="7.68">latest Chuck Schumer and Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="261.919" dur="4.541">Schumer has said well I get to what</text>
  <text start="265.25" dur="4.36">Schumer said</text>
  <text start="266.46" dur="5.1">Schiff has said for the last week that</text>
  <text start="269.61" dur="6.179">he believes there&amp;#39;s incriminating</text>
  <text start="271.56" dur="7.109">evidence proving that Trump did</text>
  <text start="275.789" dur="7.231">something corrupt in this conversation</text>
  <text start="278.669" dur="8.611">with the Ukrainian president that there</text>
  <text start="283.02" dur="6.239">was a quick quid pro quo tit-for-tat you</text>
  <text start="287.28" dur="4.53">know whatever that Trump was going to</text>
  <text start="289.259" dur="7.921">withhold money unless ukrainian</text>
  <text start="291.81" dur="9.12">President took some action against Joe</text>
  <text start="297.18" dur="5.91">Biden and or hunter Biden right that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="300.93" dur="5.39">the narrative that Adam Schiff has been</text>
  <text start="303.09" dur="8.16">pushing he has been pushing this agenda</text>
  <text start="306.32" dur="6.969">that Trump somehow leveraged the</text>
  <text start="311.25" dur="4.08">Ukrainian president withholding money I</text>
  <text start="313.289" dur="3.841">think milk money for their military if</text>
  <text start="315.33" dur="4.08">they didn&amp;#39;t do something with some</text>
  <text start="317.13" dur="4.849">pressure on Biden maybe prosecute</text>
  <text start="319.41" dur="5.49">whatever that&amp;#39;s Adams shifts accusation</text>
  <text start="321.979" dur="5.591">now Adam Schiff has been demanding that</text>
  <text start="324.9" dur="4.53">this whistleblower complaint be made</text>
  <text start="327.57" dur="3.15">public and the Director of National and</text>

  <text start="330.72" dur="7.59">Intelligence has refused to make this</text>
  <text start="333.99" dur="6.62">complaint public and part of the reason</text>
  <text start="338.31" dur="4.77">is because the inspector sorry the</text>
  <text start="340.61" dur="5.47">director acting director National</text>
  <text start="343.08" dur="8.49">Intelligence says that this is outside</text>
  <text start="346.08" dur="10.649">the purview of Congress that it it</text>
  <text start="351.57" dur="10.71">actually involves people not subject to</text>
  <text start="356.729" dur="7.171">oversight by Congress so the the acting</text>
  <text start="362.28" dur="2.609">director National Intelligence has said</text>
  <text start="363.9" dur="3.739">no we&amp;#39;re not going to make this</text>

  <text start="772.41" dur="4.35">side is a chance of being Trump their</text>
  <text start="774.48" dur="6.359">only hope of stopping Trump from getting</text>
  <text start="776.76" dur="6.27">reelected is to try to smear him through</text>
  <text start="780.839" dur="4.381">the impeachment process yeah and I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="783.03" dur="3.84">even know that that they think they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="785.22" dur="3.72">going to impeach him because they know</text>
  <text start="786.87" dur="3.48">that they can&amp;#39;t it has to go to the</text>
  <text start="788.94" dur="5.2">Senate now let me explain the</text>
  <text start="790.35" dur="8.14">impeachment process so</text>
  <text start="794.14" dur="8.58">impeachment is the right of the House of</text>
  <text start="798.49" dur="6.15">Representatives and if the house if</text>
  <text start="802.72" dur="4.08">members of the House decide they want to</text>
  <text start="804.64" dur="3.63">move forward with impeachment they can</text>
  <text start="806.8" dur="3.5">do an impeachment inquiry and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="808.27" dur="5.58">what they&amp;#39;re talking about right now and</text>
  <text start="810.3" dur="6.55">it is almost almost five o&amp;#39;clock Eastern</text>
  <text start="813.85" dur="5.94">and we&amp;#39;re supposed to have news from</text>
  <text start="816.85" dur="4.62">Nancy Pelosi and Congress what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="819.79" dur="5.1">gonna do are they going to move forward</text>
  <text start="821.47" dur="5.07">with impeachment inquiry or not so I got</text>
  <text start="824.89" dur="3.84">on here a little bit early so I can give</text>
  <text start="826.54" dur="3.87">you some news get some background so I</text>
  <text start="828.73" dur="3.63">can give you hopefully an update here in</text>
  <text start="830.41" dur="5.94">just a few minutes on what&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="832.36" dur="5.76">happen with Congress so the house which</text>
  <text start="836.35" dur="5.6">is under control the Democrats right now</text>
  <text start="838.12" dur="10.46">and want to give you a little bit of</text>
  <text start="841.95" dur="9.49">facts here the house currently has 235</text>
  <text start="848.58" dur="6.46">Democrats and they&amp;#39;re 199 Republicans in</text>
  <text start="851.44" dur="5.31">the house so if the house wanted to move</text>
  <text start="855.04" dur="3">forward with impeachment they would have</text>
  <text start="856.75" dur="3.75">to bring forward articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="858.04" dur="5.09">they&amp;#39;d have to bring charges against the</text>
  <text start="860.5" dur="5.4">president then they would vote on</text>
  <text start="863.13" dur="6.82">whether or not to move forward with</text>
  <text start="865.9" dur="8.01">impeachment they if they can if they</text>
  <text start="869.95" dur="6.57">pass the impeachment resolution by a</text>
  <text start="873.91" dur="8">simple majority then it goes to the</text>
  <text start="876.52" dur="9.78">Senate for trial now the in the Senate</text>
  <text start="881.91" dur="8.17">there is a trial and the Senate it has</text>
  <text start="886.3" dur="8.52">53 Republicans and 45 Democrats right</text>
  <text start="890.08" dur="6.68">now in the Senate the members of the</text>
  <text start="894.82" dur="4.8">House of Representative act as</text>
  <text start="896.76" dur="6.28">prosecutors and members of the Senate</text>
  <text start="899.62" dur="7.23">act as a jury and there is a trial and</text>
  <text start="903.04" dur="5.94">the Democrats the the in the house would</text>
  <text start="906.85" dur="6.39">have to bring their charges and build</text>
  <text start="908.98" dur="6.42">their case bring evidence against the</text>
  <text start="913.24" dur="5.37">president and the Senate would be the</text>
  <text start="915.4" dur="5.52">jury and they would essentially listen</text>
  <text start="918.61" dur="3.87">to the evidence listen as it adds in a</text>
  <text start="920.92" dur="4.65">criminal trial and then they would vote</text>
  <text start="922.48" dur="5.25">whether or not to convict the president</text>
  <text start="925.57" dur="4.41">in the Senate the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="927.73" dur="8.27">Justice Ruth is a presiding judge over</text>
  <text start="929.98" dur="9.09">the trial in the Senate all right now I</text>
  <text start="936" dur="5.019">highly doubt that the Democrats are</text>
  <text start="939.07" dur="3.75">actually going to move forward with</text>
  <text start="941.019" dur="4.801">impeachment and here&amp;#39;s why</text>
  <text start="942.82" dur="7.129">a lot of members Democrat members of the</text>
  <text start="945.82" dur="11.49">House know impeachment is very unpopular</text>
  <text start="949.949" dur="10.961">here&amp;#39;s something to think of a vote to</text>
  <text start="957.31" dur="6.029">impeach Trump in the house is as</text>
  <text start="960.91" dur="8.19">dangerous for Democrats as it is for</text>
  <text start="963.339" dur="8.731">Trump because a lot of voters are tired</text>
  <text start="969.1" dur="6.69">of this wrangling back and forth and in</text>
  <text start="972.07" dur="5.94">Congress they want Congress to get to</text>
  <text start="975.79" dur="6.69">work on health care they want Congress</text>
  <text start="978.01" dur="7.8">to get to work on maybe passing a budget</text>
  <text start="982.48" dur="8.659">maybe bringing down the deficit working</text>
  <text start="985.81" dur="7.8">on infrastructure right voters are</text>
  <text start="991.139" dur="4.81">extras to do something and Congress has</text>
  <text start="993.61" dur="4.89">done the house has done nothing because</text>
  <text start="995.949" dur="5.88">the house and the Senate can&amp;#39;t agree on</text>
  <text start="998.5" dur="5.55">anything they can&amp;#39;t pass gun control</text>
  <text start="1001.829" dur="3.95">legislation as Trump highlighted this</text>
  <text start="1004.05" dur="3.81">morning</text>
  <text start="1005.779" dur="4.691">Congress has completely screwed</text>
  <text start="1007.86" dur="5.82">everything up because because Jerry</text>
  <text start="1010.47" dur="4.89">Nadler and Nancy Pelosi and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1013.68" dur="3.779">focusing on all the wrong things and</text>
  <text start="1015.36" dur="4.169">their voter base is getting pretty tired</text>
  <text start="1017.459" dur="5.011">of it now here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s the problem for</text>
  <text start="1019.529" dur="5.451">the Democrats the problem for the</text>
  <text start="1022.47" dur="6.119">Democrats is they have a very vocal</text>
  <text start="1024.98" dur="7.51">small base of support that is demanding</text>
  <text start="1028.589" dur="6.99">the impeach Trump and they have a</text>
  <text start="1032.49" dur="4.89">somewhat larger base that wants this</text>
  <text start="1035.579" dur="3.391">whole thing to go away to forget about</text>
  <text start="1037.38" dur="3.48">the mulher thing forget lists stop</text>
  <text start="1038.97" dur="5.04">trying to impeach Trump get some work</text>
  <text start="1040.86" dur="6.42">done pass some legislation and do what</text>
  <text start="1044.01" dur="5.13">we sent you to Congress for so the</text>
  <text start="1047.28" dur="6.06">problem for the Democrats is they have a</text>
  <text start="1049.14" dur="6.36">split ideology in their base of support</text>
  <text start="1053.34" dur="3.69">they have a small contingent of people</text>
  <text start="1055.5" dur="5.01">who are demanding Trump be impeached</text>
  <text start="1057.03" dur="4.39">they have a larger less vocal group of</text>
  <text start="1060.51" dur="2.68">people who</text>
  <text start="1061.42" dur="4.5">Congress you just get on with what</text>
  <text start="1063.19" dur="7.17">they&amp;#39;re doing that is why they have not</text>
  <text start="1065.92" dur="6.86">moved forward with an actual serious</text>
  <text start="1070.36" dur="6.99">attempt to impeach Trump in the house is</text>
  <text start="1072.78" dur="7.87">they know they know that if if they moot</text>
  <text start="1077.35" dur="5.61">take a serious move to impeach the Trump</text>
  <text start="1080.65" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s going to piss off their basis their</text>
  <text start="1082.96" dur="6.18">most of their base of support is not in</text>
  <text start="1085.03" dur="7.67">favor of impeachment so I think what</text>
  <text start="1089.14" dur="9.21">they&amp;#39;re doing this is just my opinion I</text>
  <text start="1092.7" dur="7.9">think Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats if</text>
  <text start="1098.35" dur="5.34">they move forward with a Pietschmann</text>
  <text start="1100.6" dur="5.79">inquiry all they&amp;#39;re doing is it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1103.69" dur="6.24">meetings and discussing whether or not</text>
  <text start="1106.39" dur="5.19">we have evidence what you know what</text>
  <text start="1109.93" dur="4.02">evidence do we have against Trump should</text>
  <text start="1111.58" dur="4.56">we move forward should we not you know</text>
  <text start="1113.95" dur="3.87">what color of clouds do we need to have</text>
  <text start="1116.14" dur="2.07">before we go through with an impeachment</text>
  <text start="1117.82" dur="4.5">vote</text>
  <text start="1118.21" dur="5.61">it&amp;#39;s just stalling for time I think if</text>
  <text start="1122.32" dur="2.85">they go through with an impeachment if</text>
  <text start="1123.82" dur="3.33">they decide to do in a Pietschmann</text>
  <text start="1125.17" dur="5.85">inquiry all they&amp;#39;re doing is they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1127.15" dur="5.97">trying to placate that small vocal part</text>
  <text start="1131.02" dur="4.31">of their base of support that wants</text>
  <text start="1133.12" dur="4.47">something done to get rid of Trump and</text>
  <text start="1135.33" dur="4.78">if they do an impeachment inquiry they</text>
  <text start="1137.59" dur="6.3">can continue to drag this out they get</text>
  <text start="1140.11" dur="6.11">media coverage CNN Washington Post New</text>
  <text start="1143.89" dur="5.1">York Times could continue their</text>
  <text start="1146.22" dur="3.94">hysterical hyperventilating about oh now</text>
  <text start="1148.99" dur="3.15">the president is under an impeachment</text>
  <text start="1150.16" dur="3.9">inquiry oh it&amp;#39;s looking bad oh the walls</text>
  <text start="1152.14" dur="4.23">are closing in oh it&amp;#39;s looking like</text>
  <text start="1154.06" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;re gonna get him they have to keep</text>
  <text start="1156.37" dur="3.9">driving this narrative that Trump did</text>
  <text start="1158.86" dur="3.95">something wrong and the fact that</text>
  <text start="1160.27" dur="4.62">Congress is in an impeachment inquiry is</text>
  <text start="1162.81" dur="4.75">evidence that Trump did something wrong</text>
  <text start="1164.89" dur="5.88">they have to keep driving this narrative</text>
  <text start="1167.56" dur="5.6">they can&amp;#39;t they they don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="1170.77" dur="4.62">obviously they don&amp;#39;t have any legitimate</text>
  <text start="1173.16" dur="4.39">crimes that Trump committed or they</text>
  <text start="1175.39" dur="5.37">would have already gone through with his</text>
  <text start="1177.55" dur="4.95">impeachment but they also can&amp;#39;t let go</text>
  <text start="1180.76" dur="4.74">of it completely they have to keep</text>
  <text start="1182.5" dur="7.83">driving a news net and cycle one after</text>
  <text start="1185.5" dur="6.87">another after another as Trump is moving</text>
  <text start="1190.33" dur="4.21">his agenda forward and he&amp;#39;s moving the</text>
  <text start="1192.37" dur="4.56">football down the field they have to</text>
  <text start="1194.54" dur="4.74">they have to counter him somehow and</text>
  <text start="1196.93" dur="3.7">maybe an F to Pelosi feels right now the</text>
  <text start="1199.28" dur="4.38">best way to counter him is an</text>
  <text start="1200.63" dur="4.92">impeachment inquiry so it gives the</text>
  <text start="1203.66" dur="4.43">mainstream media something to talk about</text>
  <text start="1205.55" dur="6.27">they can keep writing articles and</text>
  <text start="1208.09" dur="9.19">trying to convince people that Trump is</text>
  <text start="1211.82" dur="9.48">this close to being impeached so let&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="1387.02" dur="5.84">the president&amp;#39;s enemies are that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="1389.15" dur="9.48">this is that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m looking at it as</text>
  <text start="1392.86" dur="7.99">it is evidence that trumps enemies are</text>
  <text start="1398.63" dur="4.62">in a panic they don&amp;#39;t know what to do</text>
  <text start="1400.85" dur="3.69">they&amp;#39;re a bit hysterical they&amp;#39;re a bit</text>
  <text start="1403.25" dur="4.83">panicked they&amp;#39;re freaked out because</text>
  <text start="1404.54" dur="7.05">Trump once again outmaneuvered them in</text>
  <text start="1408.08" dur="5.49">his forty chess and got them to go after</text>
  <text start="1411.59" dur="3.96">this Ukrainian story and now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1413.57" dur="2.97">blowing up in their face and they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1415.55" dur="4.71">know what else to do</text>
  <text start="1416.54" dur="6.36">they&amp;#39;re desperate they they don&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="1420.26" dur="4.14">very good game plan they don&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="1422.9" dur="3.72">evidence they don&amp;#39;t have any charges</text>
  <text start="1424.4" dur="4.29">they can bring against Trump you know</text>
  <text start="1426.62" dur="5.01">Muller was a nothing burger they just</text>
  <text start="1428.69" dur="5.28">keep losing and losing and losing so a</text>
  <text start="1431.63" dur="3.66">lot of this is just hysteria to drive</text>
  <text start="1433.97" dur="3.69">the mainstream media to give him</text>
  <text start="1435.29" dur="5.4">something to talk about to try to keep</text>
  <text start="1437.66" dur="6.68">their base of support hopeful but look</text>
  <text start="1440.69" dur="6.99">you know Biden is pretty much toast</text>
  <text start="1444.34" dur="6.52">Trump has been telling us in his rallies</text>
  <text start="1447.68" dur="8.46">that he really wants Elizabeth Warren as</text>
  <text start="1450.86" dur="7.02">his as his main opponent because he</text>
  <text start="1456.14" dur="3.54">wants to take her apartment from limb</text>
  <text start="1457.88" dur="3.96">and he said you know I talked about</text>
  <text start="1459.68" dur="3.72">Pocahontas a little bit too early and</text>
  <text start="1461.84" dur="3.689">I shouldn&amp;#39;t have said some of the things</text>
  <text start="1463.4" dur="4.259">I said because you know maybe she won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1465.529" dur="4.321">get the nomination Trump really wants to</text>
  <text start="1467.659" dur="2.76">Elizabeth Warren and if he Lizabeth</text>
  <text start="1469.85" dur="3.51">Warren</text>
  <text start="1470.419" dur="5.49">she&amp;#39;s turning up in the polls Joe Biden</text>
  <text start="1473.36" dur="4.65">is trending down watch for Trump to</text>
  <text start="1475.909" dur="7.231">bring out the guns on Elizabeth Warren</text>
  <text start="1478.01" dur="7.98">as soon as Biden is disposed of and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1483.14" dur="5.49">down in a single digits in polling Trump</text>
  <text start="1485.99" dur="4.86">will turn his artillery on Elizabeth</text>
  <text start="1488.63" dur="4.669">Warren and then it gets to be fun</text>
  <text start="1490.85" dur="4.74">because I think Trump has a ton of</text>
  <text start="1493.299" dur="3.671">ammunition against it Elizabeth Warren</text>
  <text start="1495.59" dur="6.48">and hasn&amp;#39;t used it yet</text>
  <text start="1496.97" dur="7.17">he&amp;#39;s waiting he is holding back yeah so</text>
  <text start="1502.07" dur="4.41">Chad program just tweeted out Nancy</text>

  <text start="1531.26" dur="6.899">violation of law the law is unequivocal</text>
  <text start="1535.01" dur="4.62">all right so she&amp;#39;s all pissed off</text>
