  <text start="110.34" dur="11.069">see ya all right</text>
  <text start="113.52" dur="11.91">so a few thousand years ago this guy who</text>
  <text start="121.409" dur="7.111">was Pharaoh of Egypt had a very</text>
  <text start="125.43" dur="8.82">disturbing dream right and in the dream</text>
  <text start="128.52" dur="8.13">he saw seven cattle that were very</text>
  <text start="134.25" dur="4.86">and they were eaten up by seven cattle</text>
  <text start="136.65" dur="5.1">that were very thin and scrawny now if</text>
  <text start="139.11" dur="5.04">you had a dream like that you would wake</text>
  <text start="141.75" dur="7.95">up and go what was that dream all about</text>
  <text start="144.15" dur="8.16">right well Pharaoh had this dream and he</text>
  <text start="149.7" dur="6.48">told it to his to this guy named Joseph</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="7.68">and God gave Joseph the interpretation</text>
  <text start="156.18" dur="11.01">of the dream and Joseph said this dream</text>
  <text start="159.99" dur="9.95">is for telling seven years of plenty</text>
  <text start="167.19" dur="5.12">followed by seven years of famine and</text>
  <text start="169.94" dur="5.62">Pharaoh said Oh what should we do and</text>
  <text start="172.31" dur="4.93">Joseph said let&amp;#39;s build some barns store</text>
  <text start="175.56" dur="3.84">up the grain hey how you doing guys</text>
  <text start="177.24" dur="6.27">let&amp;#39;s build up some barns store up the</text>
  <text start="179.4" dur="7.2">grain that way we&amp;#39;ll have extra grain</text>
  <text start="183.51" dur="4.67">stirred up each year during the Plenty</text>
  <text start="186.6" dur="3.96">and then when the famine comes we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="188.18" dur="2.92">take down the food and we won&amp;#39;t starve</text>
  <text start="190.56" dur="4.59">to death</text>
  <text start="191.1" dur="6.75">so God by giving a dream to Pharaoh and</text>
  <text start="195.15" dur="6.089">the interpretation to Joseph saved a</text>
  <text start="197.85" dur="6.96">nation saved millions of people all</text>
  <text start="201.239" dur="5.551">right this is just introduction for some</text>
  <text start="204.81" dur="3.84">of you who are not kind of hip to what</text>

  <text start="257.16" dur="6.45">missiles went into Syria Rex Tillerson</text>
  <text start="260" dur="7.09">was in Turkey and he told the world as</text>
  <text start="263.61" dur="7.44">far as the United States is concerned</text>
  <text start="267.09" dur="5.579">Assad can stay in Syria have democratic</text>

  <text start="403.56" dur="6.05">some people have jumped to the</text>
  <text start="405.09" dur="8.129">conclusion that Trump is now okay with a</text>
  <text start="409.61" dur="6.94">policy of regime change so we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="413.219" dur="5.16">to go down to Somalia we&amp;#39;re gonna go to</text>

  <text start="660.839" dur="5.131">reason why long ago is really has been</text>
  <text start="663.449" dur="4.261">supporting Trump is because he&amp;#39;s heard</text>

  <text start="864.42" dur="6.94">rich Berra prophecy Trump was going to</text>
  <text start="867.46" dur="6.78">win yeah yeah I was actually on the Sid</text>

  <text start="876.97" dur="3.69">show and said Roth the same day he taped</text>
  <text start="878.77" dur="10.5">his show where Sid was asking her about</text>
  <text start="880.66" dur="10.64">the dreams he had about Trump so so the</text>
  <text start="889.27" dur="4.49">dream that I had last night was very</text>
  <text start="891.3" dur="7.72">interesting all right</text>
  <text start="893.76" dur="8.68">here&amp;#39;s here&amp;#39;s what the dream was I saw</text>
  <text start="899.02" dur="8.31">several scenes where people were</text>
  <text start="902.44" dur="6.96">discussing Trump and the recent events</text>
  <text start="907.33" dur="8.43">that have happened and why some people</text>
  <text start="909.4" dur="8.37">had left and and walked away from their</text>
  <text start="915.76" dur="3.33">allegiance to Trump why people left</text>
  <text start="917.77" dur="3.63">Trump why they weren&amp;#39;t supporting him</text>
  <text start="919.09" dur="4.77">anymore and I saw this conversation</text>
  <text start="921.4" dur="6.3">going on it was like it was on social</text>
  <text start="923.86" dur="6.589">media I think or just saw these scenes</text>
  <text start="927.7" dur="4.639">and there were some very</text>
  <text start="930.449" dur="6.091">pretty well known people and have some</text>
  <text start="932.339" dur="6.3">large platforms on social media you</text>
  <text start="936.54" dur="3.93">their household names now they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="938.639" dur="5.73">have like their own TV shows but they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="940.47" dur="6.409">big on social media and they&amp;#39;re all have</text>
  <text start="944.369" dur="7.91">been very outspoken Trump supporters</text>
  <text start="946.879" dur="12.341">until a week ago they bailed on Trump</text>
  <text start="952.279" dur="9.691">after the missile attack right they</text>
  <text start="959.22" dur="5.82">these people who have large platforms</text>
  <text start="961.97" dur="5.38">bailed out on Trump and some of them are</text>
  <text start="965.04" dur="5.94">still supporting Trump but they do not</text>
  <text start="967.35" dur="5.37">like his policy or his the attack in</text>
  <text start="970.98" dur="3.659">Syria and they&amp;#39;ve been making a lot of</text>
  <text start="972.72" dur="4.88">noise about it okay</text>
  <text start="974.639" dur="8.1">so that&amp;#39;s what I saw going on the dream</text>
  <text start="977.6" dur="8.589">in the dream some evidence came out that</text>
  <text start="982.739" dur="5.1">proved conclusively that the assumptions</text>
  <text start="986.189" dur="6.93">these people had made were completely</text>
  <text start="987.839" dur="8.071">wrong it was like video evidence was</text>
  <text start="993.119" dur="4.26">brought out into the public that left</text>
  <text start="995.91" dur="4.769">these people standing in with egg on</text>
  <text start="997.379" dur="5.25">their face because they had doubted and</text>
  <text start="1000.679" dur="6.15">questioned what Trump was doing and they</text>
  <text start="1002.629" dur="8.25">were proven absolutely wrong that Trump</text>
  <text start="1006.829" dur="6.391">was not going had never planned to do</text>
  <text start="1010.879" dur="10.5">any military action in Syria that there</text>
  <text start="1013.22" dur="12.479">is no there is no plan to go in and send</text>
  <text start="1021.379" dur="6.54">ground troops in in in the dream is very</text>
  <text start="1025.699" dur="3.84">apparent to me that this narrative that</text>
  <text start="1027.919" dur="4.65">is being pushed now it&amp;#39;s completely</text>
  <text start="1029.539" dur="8.37">false and people are going to find out</text>
  <text start="1032.569" dur="8.75">that that narrative is false yeah sorry</text>
