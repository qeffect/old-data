  <text start="17.64" dur="3.16">something has been weighing on my mind</text>
  <text start="19.36" dur="4.26">for a long time and I wanted to write a</text>
  <text start="20.8" dur="4.02">blog post about this but it&amp;#39;s too long</text>
  <text start="23.62" dur="4.44">too big of a subject to write a blog</text>
  <text start="24.82" dur="6.87">post about and it comes down to this</text>
  <text start="28.06" dur="8.76">question of does God sovereignly</text>
  <text start="31.69" dur="9.39">accomplish his will and what is our part</text>
  <text start="36.82" dur="6.21">in making his plans come to pass it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="41.08" dur="6.479">big question and I&amp;#39;m gonna try to unpack</text>
  <text start="43.03" dur="6.21">that in this message so most of us know</text>
  <text start="47.559" dur="3.631">there are Bible verses that say things</text>
  <text start="49.24" dur="6.3">like God watches over his word to</text>
  <text start="51.19" dur="7.08">perform it that God makes his plans come</text>
  <text start="55.54" dur="5.88">to pass now I have a lot of Christian</text>
  <text start="58.27" dur="5.91">friends who send me emails and messages</text>
  <text start="61.42" dur="4.41">and they say look you know I&amp;#39;ve received</text>
  <text start="64.18" dur="3.689">prophetic words that I&amp;#39;m gonna have a</text>
  <text start="65.83" dur="3.84">healing ministry or they say I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="67.869" dur="3.961">received prophetic revelation that I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="69.67" dur="4.22">gonna have a business and I&amp;#39;m wondering</text>
  <text start="71.83" dur="4.71">when God is going to make this happen</text>
  <text start="73.89" dur="4.39">the Prophet the man of God told me that</text>
  <text start="76.54" dur="3.54">God is sending a woman that&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="78.28" dur="4.11">the woman of my dreams and she&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="80.08" dur="3.929">be a proverbs 31 woman and I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="82.39" dur="4.259">waiting for that to happen and it hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="84.009" dur="7.831">happened so when is God gonna make it</text>
  <text start="86.649" dur="9.511">happen and my response to this is</text>
  <text start="91.84" dur="6.69">generally kind of the same thing I asked</text>
  <text start="96.16" dur="5.64">him a question what are you doing to</text>
  <text start="98.53" dur="5.97">make that come to pass people who have</text>
  <text start="101.8" dur="5.01">had desire or prophetic words or dreams</text>
  <text start="104.5" dur="4.89">about having a healing ministry my</text>
  <text start="106.81" dur="4.8">question to you is have you taken any</text>
  <text start="109.39" dur="3.72">classes on healing have you got any</text>
  <text start="111.61" dur="3.539">instruction are you doing any training</text>
  <text start="113.11" dur="3.99">and equipping are you actually going out</text>
  <text start="115.149" dur="3.631">in the streets and praying for people</text>

  <text start="123.369" dur="3.661">knowledge and step out and start</text>
  <text start="125.17" dur="4.229">practicing your healing ministry is</text>
  <text start="127.03" dur="6.21">never going to come to pass even though</text>
  <text start="129.399" dur="6.841">God has a plan a desire for you to have</text>
  <text start="133.24" dur="5.19">a healing ministry if you do not take</text>
  <text start="136.24" dur="3.3">the initiative to get trained and</text>
  <text start="138.43" dur="4.41">equipped and step out and pray for</text>
  <text start="139.54" dur="6.6">people it&amp;#39;s never going to happen you</text>
  <text start="142.84" dur="5.239">have to cooperate with God&amp;#39;s plan all</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="4.14">right that&amp;#39;s just one simple</text>
  <text start="148.079" dur="2.681">illustration I have friends who have had</text>
  <text start="150.28" dur="2.819">prophetic</text>
  <text start="150.76" dur="4.02">words about businesses when is God gonna</text>
  <text start="153.099" dur="3">make this business come to pass when is</text>
  <text start="154.78" dur="3.51">he gonna bless me with all these</text>
  <text start="156.099" dur="4.11">financial blessings that the prophets of</text>
  <text start="158.29" dur="3.869">God have been telling me about well you</text>
  <text start="160.209" dur="4.381">know if you don&amp;#39;t actually sit down and</text>
  <text start="162.159" dur="5.731">get a business license and put together</text>
  <text start="164.59" dur="5.25">a business plan and go through the work</text>
  <text start="167.89" dur="4.95">of creating this business it&amp;#39;s never</text>
  <text start="169.84" dur="6.66">going to come to pass you have a</text>
  <text start="172.84" dur="6.06">responsibility to partner with God to</text>
  <text start="176.5" dur="4.019">make his plans come to pass God is not</text>
  <text start="178.9" dur="5.699">going to sovereignly make these things</text>
  <text start="180.519" dur="7.05">come to pass now just give you an</text>
  <text start="184.599" dur="6.621">illustration for myself when I started</text>
  <text start="187.569" dur="6.211">having dreams about eight nine years ago</text>
  <text start="191.22" dur="5.98">early on I had a lot of dreams about</text>
  <text start="193.78" dur="6.15">healing and I had some dreams where God</text>
  <text start="197.2" dur="6.689">was showing me that he wanted to use me</text>
  <text start="199.93" dur="7.199">to solve murder cases cold cases through</text>
  <text start="203.889" dur="6.24">prophetic revelation in the dreams I saw</text>
  <text start="207.129" dur="6.45">myself giving information to FBI agents</text>
  <text start="210.129" dur="5.07">about cold cases I was given street</text>
  <text start="213.579" dur="4.53">addresses I was giving a detailed</text>
  <text start="215.199" dur="5.611">detailed information about cold cases</text>
  <text start="218.109" dur="3.99">that that had been you know they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="220.81" dur="3.269">have any leads on they didn&amp;#39;t have any</text>
  <text start="222.099" dur="4.53">any evidence no arrests were made</text>
  <text start="224.079" dur="5.671">so in these dreams God was showing me I</text>
  <text start="226.629" dur="6">want to use you to help solve these</text>
  <text start="229.75" dur="8.389">murder cases now Denise and I talked</text>
  <text start="232.629" dur="8.341">about this back then and she said no I</text>
  <text start="238.139" dur="3.551">don&amp;#39;t want any part of that that&amp;#39;s too</text>
  <text start="240.97" dur="4.049">dangerous</text>
  <text start="241.69" dur="7.68">no you&amp;#39;re not going to do that so God</text>
  <text start="245.019" dur="6.93">gave me a revelation a plan about</text>
  <text start="249.37" dur="5.179">something he wanted me to do and I chose</text>
  <text start="251.949" dur="2.6">not to do it</text>
  <text start="254.819" dur="6.29">did God make his plan come to pass</text>
  <text start="257.19" dur="6">through me no because I chose not to</text>
  <text start="261.109" dur="5.831">cooperate with him and make that happen</text>
  <text start="263.19" dur="6.69">so what happened he gave it to somebody</text>
  <text start="266.94" dur="5.64">else he gave that assignment to someone</text>
  <text start="269.88" dur="6.599">else who would cooperate with him in</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="7.64">making it come to pass now I want to</text>
  <text start="276.479" dur="5.851">read to you the parable of the talents</text>
  <text start="280.22" dur="5.79">okay I&amp;#39;m just gonna read real quick</text>
  <text start="282.33" dur="7.08">this is Matthew 25 verses 14 through 30</text>
  <text start="286.01" dur="6.1">Jesus said for the kingdom of heaven is</text>
  <text start="289.41" dur="4.83">like unto a man traveling to a far</text>
  <text start="292.11" dur="4.98">country who called his own servants and</text>
  <text start="294.24" dur="5.07">delivered his goods to them and to one</text>
  <text start="297.09" dur="5.609">he gave five talents and to another heap</text>
  <text start="299.31" dur="7.109">to and to a third he gave one to each</text>
  <text start="302.699" dur="5.25">according to his own ability and then</text>
  <text start="306.419" dur="3.441">immediately he went on a journey now I</text>
  <text start="307.949" dur="4.711">want to make a little commentary here</text>
  <text start="309.86" dur="5.92">God did not give to them according to</text>
  <text start="312.66" dur="7.86">their needs he gave to them according to</text>
  <text start="315.78" dur="10.169">their ability now what does Marxism</text>
  <text start="320.52" dur="9">teach it teaches that we should give to</text>
  <text start="325.949" dur="6.421">each according to their need because</text>
  <text start="329.52" dur="5.399">Marxism and socialism believes that</text>
  <text start="332.37" dur="4.079">everyone should have the exact same</text>
  <text start="334.919" dur="3.421">amount of group no matter who they are</text>
  <text start="336.449" dur="4.621">everyone gets according to their needs</text>
  <text start="338.34" dur="4.829">but see Jesus says here in this kingdom</text>
  <text start="341.07" dur="4.86">parable that&amp;#39;s not how the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="343.169" dur="4.68">heaven works you don&amp;#39;t receive according</text>
  <text start="345.93" dur="4.56">to your needs you receive according to</text>
  <text start="347.849" dur="5.431">your ability and everyone has different</text>
  <text start="350.49" dur="4.549">abilities and talents and gifts and we</text>
  <text start="353.28" dur="6.449">all received differently</text>
  <text start="355.039" dur="5.171">God is not a socialist just throwing</text>
  <text start="359.729" dur="4.461">that out there</text>
  <text start="360.21" dur="8.429">all right so I&amp;#39;m gonna continue in verse</text>
  <text start="364.19" dur="6.4">16 then he who had received five talents</text>
  <text start="368.639" dur="3.9">went and traded with them and made</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="4.41">another five talents wait a minute he</text>
  <text start="372.539" dur="3.75">took five talents and he like invested</text>
  <text start="375" dur="4.289">them and made five more talents that</text>
  <text start="376.289" dur="6.87">sounds like capitalism hang on</text>
  <text start="379.289" dur="7.261">and likewise he who had two talents took</text>
  <text start="383.159" dur="5.13">them and gained two more also but he who</text>
  <text start="386.55" dur="3.989">had received one</text>
  <text start="388.289" dur="4.56">went and dug in the ground and hid his</text>
  <text start="390.539" dur="3.81">Lords money and after a long time the</text>
  <text start="392.849" dur="4.141">Lord of those servants came and settled</text>
  <text start="394.349" dur="4.59">his accounts with them so he who</text>
  <text start="396.99" dur="4.649">received five talents came brought the</text>
  <text start="398.939" dur="4.5">five more and said Lord you delivered to</text>
  <text start="401.639" dur="4.17">me five talents look I&amp;#39;ve gained five</text>
  <text start="403.439" dur="3.63">more talents beside them his Lord said</text>
  <text start="405.809" dur="3.33">to him well done good and faithful</text>
  <text start="407.069" dur="3.57">servant you have been faithful over a</text>
  <text start="409.139" dur="5.28">few things I will make you ruler over</text>
  <text start="410.639" dur="7.351">many things God rewards people who take</text>
  <text start="414.419" dur="7.08">risks it&amp;#39;s at risk when you take your</text>
  <text start="417.99" dur="6">five talents and you invest and you take</text>
  <text start="421.499" dur="6.39">it and you apply it and try to make more</text>
  <text start="423.99" dur="6.09">you&amp;#39;re taking risks God rewards people</text>
  <text start="427.889" dur="5.07">who take risk he rewards people who are</text>
  <text start="430.08" dur="5.669">obedient who are faithful he said well</text>
  <text start="432.959" dur="5.73">done good and faithful servant what God</text>
  <text start="435.749" dur="5.76">asks from us is faithfulness he wants us</text>
  <text start="438.689" dur="4.59">to be faithful to the calling and the</text>
  <text start="441.509" dur="4.53">talents in the gifting that he&amp;#39;s give us</text>
  <text start="443.279" dur="4.14">he wants us to use them to multiply them</text>
  <text start="446.039" dur="5.31">the kingdom of God is all about</text>
  <text start="447.419" dur="5.881">multiplication he also who had received</text>
  <text start="451.349" dur="3.54">two talents came and said Lord you</text>
  <text start="453.3" dur="4.53">delivered to me two talents look I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="454.889" dur="4.38">gained two more talents beside them his</text>
  <text start="457.83" dur="2.729">Lord said to him well done good and</text>
  <text start="459.269" dur="2.94">faithful servant you&amp;#39;ve been faithful</text>
  <text start="460.559" dur="3.48">over a few things I&amp;#39;ll make you ruler</text>
  <text start="462.209" dur="4.56">over many things enter into joy your</text>
  <text start="464.039" dur="4.68">Lord then he who had received one talent</text>
  <text start="466.769" dur="4.5">came and said lord I knew you to be a</text>
  <text start="468.719" dur="3.87">hard man reaping where you have not sown</text>
  <text start="471.269" dur="4.71">gathering where you have not scattered</text>
  <text start="472.589" dur="5.64">seed I was afraid and I went and hid</text>
  <text start="475.979" dur="4.381">your talent in the ground look here is</text>
  <text start="478.229" dur="3.81">what you have it is yours but his Lord</text>
  <text start="480.36" dur="3.959">answered and said to him you wicked and</text>
  <text start="482.039" dur="4.321">lazy servant you knew that I reap where</text>
  <text start="484.319" dur="4.02">I haven&amp;#39;t sown and I gather where I have</text>
  <text start="486.36" dur="3.959">not scattered seed so you ought to have</text>
  <text start="488.339" dur="4.56">deposited my money with the bankers that</text>
  <text start="490.319" dur="6.24">when I returned I would at least receive</text>
  <text start="492.899" dur="6.11">interest therefore take the talent from</text>
  <text start="496.559" dur="6.48">him and give it to the one who has ten</text>
  <text start="499.009" dur="6.49">wait a minute wait a minute you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="503.039" dur="3.75">taking away a talent from one person and</text>
  <text start="505.499" dur="4.07">giving it to somebody who&amp;#39;s already</text>
  <text start="506.789" dur="5.73">wealthy and has more that&amp;#39;s like reverse</text>
  <text start="509.569" dur="4.39">distribution of wealth you can&amp;#39;t take</text>
  <text start="512.519" dur="3.541">money from people who don&amp;#39;t have much</text>
  <text start="513.959" dur="5.01">and give it to the rich what is all</text>
  <text start="516.06" dur="5.859">about see the kingdom of God is not</text>
  <text start="518.969" dur="6.37">about socialism and wealth distribution</text>
  <text start="521.919" dur="6.181">the kingdom of God rewards people who</text>
  <text start="525.339" dur="5.37">are faithful and it punishes people who</text>
  <text start="528.1" dur="4.62">are lazy and wicked that&amp;#39;s what Jesus</text>
  <text start="530.709" dur="4.5">called him lazy and wicked servant if</text>
  <text start="532.72" dur="5.309">you are lazy and you are wicked you are</text>
  <text start="535.209" dur="5.701">not going to be given more you have to</text>
  <text start="538.029" dur="4.77">be faithful that is how you multiply</text>
  <text start="540.91" dur="4.38">that is how you grow in the kingdom I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="542.799" dur="4.681">sorry if you&amp;#39;re a Bernie supporter and</text>
  <text start="545.29" dur="4.589">you like socialism this message is</text>
  <text start="547.48" dur="6.659">really not gonna sit well with you but</text>
  <text start="549.879" dur="8.49">God is not a socialist the thing to take</text>
  <text start="554.139" dur="7.23">away from this is the fact that God</text>
  <text start="558.369" dur="6.15">gives us talents abilities gifts he</text>
  <text start="561.369" dur="5.37">gives us revelation he gives us a vision</text>
  <text start="564.519" dur="4.951">of what he wants us to accomplish and</text>
  <text start="566.739" dur="5.481">then it is up to us to partner with him</text>
  <text start="569.47" dur="6.209">to make it come to pass God does not</text>
  <text start="572.22" dur="6.489">sovereignly make his plans come to pass</text>
  <text start="575.679" dur="7.14">without our cooperation we have to work</text>
  <text start="578.709" dur="7.951">invest we have to spend our time making</text>
  <text start="582.819" dur="6.26">these things happen I have a number of</text>
  <text start="586.66" dur="5.429">people that God gives me revelation</text>

  <text start="592.089" dur="5.641">messages you know that I&amp;#39;m something</text>
  <text start="594.189" dur="6.33">like gods tow truck whenever someone</text>
  <text start="597.73" dur="6.359">whenever God has chosen someone to do</text>
  <text start="600.519" dur="5.85">something and that person is having some</text>
  <text start="604.089" dur="4.201">difficulty understanding what it is that</text>
  <text start="606.369" dur="3.72">God wants to do with them he will send</text>

  <text start="630.85" dur="3.81">been doing this for a long time this is</text>
  <text start="632.289" dur="3.931">like a major part of what I do and I</text>
  <text start="634.66" dur="4.049">have many people and I would almost call</text>

  <text start="638.709" dur="4.98">me actually I typically help them</text>
  <text start="641.769" dur="3.9">financially I support them financially</text>
  <text start="643.689" dur="3.27">because I believe in what it is that</text>
  <text start="645.669" dur="3.12">they&amp;#39;re doing when God gives me an</text>
  <text start="646.959" dur="4.98">assignment for somebody I like to</text>
  <text start="648.789" dur="4.681">support them financially so I can call</text>
  <text start="651.939" dur="3.21">them clients but you know whatever</text>
  <text start="653.47" dur="2.12">they&amp;#39;re just people that God puts on my</text>
  <text start="655.149" dur="5.031">radar</text>
  <text start="655.59" dur="6.72">I had a client who God gave me</text>
  <text start="660.18" dur="4.83">revelation about what he wanted that</text>
  <text start="662.31" dur="4.23">person to do I was giving that person</text>
  <text start="665.01" dur="4.02">the revelation I was helping them</text>
  <text start="666.54" dur="4.35">understand what it looked like and they</text>
  <text start="669.03" dur="3.78">started to obey it and they were walking</text>
  <text start="670.89" dur="4.41">in it and it was coming to pass and they</text>
  <text start="672.81" dur="5.85">were building this operation that God</text>
  <text start="675.3" dur="6.51">had planned initially this person needed</text>
  <text start="678.66" dur="4.98">some help so he recruited some people to</text>
  <text start="681.81" dur="4.23">help him and the people who got involved</text>
  <text start="683.64" dur="4.08">in the beginning were good people they</text>
  <text start="686.04" dur="3.21">understood God&amp;#39;s heart they understood</text>
  <text start="687.72" dur="4.71">God&amp;#39;s vision for this and they were</text>
  <text start="689.25" dur="7.95">helping this person build this or this</text>
  <text start="692.43" dur="7.26">operation but then the person that I was</text>
  <text start="697.2" dur="4.32">was my client had some problems with</text>
  <text start="699.69" dur="6.18">those people and replaced them with</text>
  <text start="701.52" dur="8.1">somebody else that person did not have a</text>
  <text start="705.87" dur="7.53">revelation of God&amp;#39;s heart and his plan</text>
  <text start="709.62" dur="6.78">because probably the enemy didn&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="713.4" dur="7.5">God&amp;#39;s plan to succeed so the enemy came</text>
  <text start="716.4" dur="6.69">and sowed tares into the wheat and the</text>
  <text start="720.9" dur="4.62">PERT the people who came in to help the</text>
  <text start="723.09" dur="4.29">second group of people didn&amp;#39;t have God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="725.52" dur="4.05">heart didn&amp;#39;t have God&amp;#39;s plan and they</text>
  <text start="727.38" dur="5.01">began to sabotage the work that God</text>
  <text start="729.57" dur="4.74">wanted to do it didn&amp;#39;t take very long</text>
  <text start="732.39" dur="4.47">before this whole operation started to</text>
  <text start="734.31" dur="5.46">go off track and it started to</text>
  <text start="736.86" dur="6.21">self-destruct and implode and right now</text>
  <text start="739.77" dur="6.98">it&amp;#39;s kind of a flaming wreck because the</text>
  <text start="743.07" dur="7.14">person my client made some bad decisions</text>
  <text start="746.75" dur="5.85">along the way and wasn&amp;#39;t following God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="750.21" dur="5.16">plan in his heart the way he should have</text>
  <text start="752.6" dur="6.43">so if you&amp;#39;re not gonna follow God&amp;#39;s plan</text>
  <text start="755.37" dur="8.84">God&amp;#39;s plan isn&amp;#39;t gonna come to pass now</text>
  <text start="759.03" dur="8.01">in the aftermath of that God gave me</text>
  <text start="764.21" dur="5.08">revelation about the same kind of plan</text>
  <text start="767.04" dur="3.99">but for he wanted someone else to be</text>
  <text start="769.29" dur="3.27">involved in it he was like okay well if</text>
  <text start="771.03" dur="3.51">that person is not gonna do it I&amp;#39;ll give</text>
  <text start="772.56" dur="4.32">it to somebody else I&amp;#39;ll take that</text>
  <text start="774.54" dur="6.56">talent from that person and I will give</text>
  <text start="776.88" dur="7.71">it to someone else so God has shown me a</text>
  <text start="781.1" dur="6.28">someone else who is going to be given an</text>
  <text start="784.59" dur="4.65">opportunity to do the same things that</text>
  <text start="787.38" dur="4.11">first client was asked to do</text>
  <text start="789.24" dur="8.519">and we&amp;#39;ll see if that&amp;#39;s gonna come to</text>
  <text start="791.49" dur="10.259">pass God still wants that plan to come</text>
  <text start="797.759" dur="5.461">about he wants that operation to succeed</text>
  <text start="801.749" dur="3.06">but if one person isn&amp;#39;t gonna be</text>
  <text start="803.22" dur="4.02">faithful to it God will find somebody</text>
  <text start="804.809" dur="4.53">else and he&amp;#39;ll bring that person in and</text>
  <text start="807.24" dur="3.959">he&amp;#39;ll give people like me revelation</text>
  <text start="809.339" dur="3.87">understanding about what that plan is</text>
  <text start="811.199" dur="4.89">supposed to look like God is still</text>
  <text start="813.209" dur="5.19">working on this thing so I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="816.089" dur="6.09">back to the Bible here just for a second</text>
  <text start="818.399" dur="5.821">and give you an illustration when Judas</text>
  <text start="822.179" dur="3.991">was chosen as one of the twelve</text>
  <text start="824.22" dur="4.38">disciples you know theologians argue</text>
  <text start="826.17" dur="4.829">think Jesus must have known that Judas</text>
  <text start="828.6" dur="6.06">was gonna be a traitor why did Jesus</text>
  <text start="830.999" dur="6.75">pick Judas knowing he was gonna be a</text>
  <text start="834.66" dur="6">traitor right so why did God pick</text>
  <text start="837.749" dur="5.101">someone like my client who he knew he</text>
  <text start="840.66" dur="4.049">could foresee wasn&amp;#39;t going to make this</text>
  <text start="842.85" dur="4.95">thing come to pass he could see he was</text>
  <text start="844.709" dur="4.98">gonna crash and burn why did God give me</text>
  <text start="847.8" dur="4.86">the revelation to this person who was</text>
  <text start="849.689" dur="4.59">gonna fail why did God pick Judas as one</text>
  <text start="852.66" dur="4.44">of the disciples or one of the Apostles</text>
  <text start="854.279" dur="6.571">I don&amp;#39;t know but I will say this when</text>
  <text start="857.1" dur="7.56">Judas allowed the enemy to get inside</text>
  <text start="860.85" dur="7.739">his head it destroyed the plan that God</text>
  <text start="864.66" dur="6.419">had for Judas but still God will always</text>
  <text start="868.589" dur="4.021">give you an assignment a calling your</text>
  <text start="871.079" dur="5.461">talents and your gifts and it&amp;#39;s up to</text>
  <text start="872.61" dur="6.259">you to make that work out if you let the</text>
  <text start="876.54" dur="4.769">enemy come in and get in your head and</text>
  <text start="878.869" dur="2.801">mess you up it&amp;#39;s not going to come to</text>
  <text start="881.309" dur="1.95">pass</text>
  <text start="881.67" dur="5.07">but God will always give us</text>
  <text start="883.259" dur="7.711">opportunities we need to seize the</text>
  <text start="886.74" dur="5.73">opportunities and we need to partner</text>
  <text start="890.97" dur="5.369">with God to make them come to pass now</text>
  <text start="892.47" dur="6.89">here&amp;#39;s a question when Judas killed</text>
  <text start="896.339" dur="6.8">himself and took him out of God&amp;#39;s plan</text>
  <text start="899.36" dur="6.31">who did God replace him with well the</text>
  <text start="903.139" dur="5.32">disciples went and cast lots and they</text>
  <text start="905.67" dur="5.579">chose another apostle but some</text>
  <text start="908.459" dur="6.5">theologians would argue that the Apostle</text>
  <text start="911.249" dur="6.601">Paul was chosen to replace Judas now</text>
  <text start="914.959" dur="5.141">here in the 21st century we all know the</text>
  <text start="917.85" dur="5.25">Apostle Paul was this great teacher</text>
  <text start="920.1" dur="6.75">preacher father of the church theologian</text>
  <text start="923.1" dur="8.34">but when God chose the Apostle Paul he</text>
  <text start="926.85" dur="6.96">was not this man he was a very</text>
  <text start="931.44" dur="3.93">hard-headed stubborn man he was</text>
  <text start="933.81" dur="3.21">persecuting the church he was an</text>
  <text start="935.37" dur="3.93">imprisoning believers and having them</text>
  <text start="937.02" dur="5">tortured I&amp;#39;m gonna read to you Acts</text>
  <text start="939.3" dur="5.49">chapter 9 a couple of verses real quick</text>
  <text start="942.02" dur="6.4">now there was a certain disciple at</text>
  <text start="944.79" dur="7.92">Damascus named Ananias and the Lord said</text>
  <text start="948.42" dur="6.78">to him in a vision Ananias and and and I</text>
  <text start="952.71" dur="5.18">said Lord I&amp;#39;m here and the Lord said</text>
  <text start="955.2" dur="5.85">arise go to the street called straight</text>
  <text start="957.89" dur="3.85">inquire at the house of Judas for one</text>
  <text start="961.05" dur="3.54">called</text>
  <text start="961.74" dur="5.16">Saul of Tarsus for behold he is praying</text>
  <text start="964.59" dur="4.92">in a vision he has seen a man named</text>
  <text start="966.9" dur="3.84">Ananias coming in and putting his hand</text>
  <text start="969.51" dur="1.71">on him so that he might receive his</text>
  <text start="970.74" dur="4.2">sight</text>
  <text start="971.22" dur="7.11">then Ananias answered what is Ananias</text>
  <text start="974.94" dur="5.55">argued against God and said Lord I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="978.33" dur="5.04">heard from many people about this man</text>
  <text start="980.49" dur="4.92">how much harm he&amp;#39;s done to your Saints</text>
  <text start="983.37" dur="4.53">in Jerusalem and here he has authority</text>
  <text start="985.41" dur="4.86">from the chief priests to bind all who</text>
  <text start="987.9" dur="5.85">call upon your name so Ananias is like</text>
  <text start="990.27" dur="6.27">Lord this guy is not a church leader he</text>
  <text start="993.75" dur="5.88">hates us he&amp;#39;s persecuting us you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="996.54" dur="6.57">possibly be choosing him as a leader so</text>
  <text start="999.63" dur="6.24">the Lord says to Ananias go he is a</text>
  <text start="1003.11" dur="4.89">chosen vessel of mine to bear my name</text>
  <text start="1005.87" dur="4.44">before the Gentiles kings and the</text>
  <text start="1008" dur="3.81">children of Israel for I will show him</text>
  <text start="1010.31" dur="4.14">the many things he must suffer from a</text>
  <text start="1011.81" dur="4.83">namesake so God chooses this guy who is</text>
  <text start="1014.45" dur="5.37">like the most unlikely person to be the</text>
  <text start="1016.64" dur="6.27">next apostle store that in the back of</text>
  <text start="1019.82" dur="6.63">your mind because when God calls</text>
  <text start="1022.91" dur="5.94">somebody to carry out the assignment</text>
  <text start="1026.45" dur="4.05">that he gave to somebody else it may not</text>
  <text start="1028.85" dur="4.59">be the person that you&amp;#39;re thinking it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1030.5" dur="5.61">supposed to be you may look at this</text>
  <text start="1033.44" dur="5.1">person he was going to pick up the baton</text>
  <text start="1036.11" dur="6">and keep running with it and think wow</text>
  <text start="1038.54" dur="7.35">this person is unqualified rough around</text>
  <text start="1042.11" dur="6.03">the edges immature I can&amp;#39;t receive from</text>
  <text start="1045.89" dur="3.66">this person they&amp;#39;re a mess are you</text>
  <text start="1048.14" dur="3.51">serious we&amp;#39;re supposed to follow this</text>
  <text start="1049.55" dur="5.9">person that&amp;#39;s what the disciples were</text>
  <text start="1051.65" dur="3.8">thinking when God chose Saul of Tarsus</text>
  <text start="1056.04" dur="8.81">God is carrying on the plans that he had</text>
  <text start="1061.04" dur="5.59">right now he is rebuilding he is</text>
  <text start="1064.85" dur="4.6">bringing people together</text>
  <text start="1066.63" dur="5.76">he has already chosen some leaders and</text>
  <text start="1069.45" dur="4.59">some of those people may not look the</text>
  <text start="1072.39" dur="3.42">way you think they should look they may</text>
  <text start="1074.04" dur="5.28">not behave the way you expect them to</text>
  <text start="1075.81" dur="5.42">behave but think about this before Saul</text>
  <text start="1079.32" dur="6">of Tarsus was able to be a church leader</text>
  <text start="1081.23" dur="6.88">by his own admission he went to the</text>
  <text start="1085.32" dur="5.79">desert of Arabia for 13 years and was</text>
  <text start="1088.11" dur="5.73">discipled by God and God taught him and</text>
  <text start="1091.11" dur="5.79">retrained his brain and renewed his mind</text>
  <text start="1093.84" dur="7.7">to the truth before he could be used to</text>
  <text start="1096.9" dur="8.13">teach the churches he had a long time of</text>
  <text start="1101.54" dur="7.36">instruction from God God picks people</text>
  <text start="1105.03" dur="5.73">and we have to be patient and we have to</text>
  <text start="1108.9" dur="6.12">give them time to mature we have to give</text>
  <text start="1110.76" dur="6.72">them time to fit into their shoes that</text>
  <text start="1115.02" dur="3.57">God&amp;#39;s given them they&amp;#39;re not gonna get</text>
  <text start="1117.48" dur="2.16">it right away they&amp;#39;re gonna miss it</text>
  <text start="1118.59" dur="4.29">they&amp;#39;re gonna make mistakes and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1119.64" dur="6.9">gonna do dumb things but you know I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1122.88" dur="6.78">already seen that God is choosing people</text>
  <text start="1126.54" dur="5.21">to continue what we are doing in the</text>
  <text start="1129.66" dur="7.23">aftermath of some very difficult things</text>
  <text start="1131.75" dur="9.28">so that&amp;#39;s how we carry on we stick</text>
  <text start="1136.89" dur="8.1">together we lean on each other we pray</text>
  <text start="1141.03" dur="7.11">for each other we support one another we</text>
  <text start="1144.99" dur="5.94">come together in love and we give the</text>
  <text start="1148.14" dur="5.58">new leaders some time to figure it out</text>
