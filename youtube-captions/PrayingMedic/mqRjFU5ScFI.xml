  <text start="137.05" dur="8.82">book hearing God&amp;#39;s voice made simple and</text>
  <text start="141.45" dur="6.55">this chapter is something that a lot of</text>
  <text start="145.87" dur="3.3">you probably know but we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="148" dur="4.11">about it anyway because a lot of people</text>
  <text start="149.17" dur="6.45">don&amp;#39;t know this but that is the fact</text>
  <text start="152.11" dur="5.76">that God speaks to everyone and everyone</text>
  <text start="155.62" dur="2.64">hears God&amp;#39;s voice whether you know it or</text>
  <text start="157.87" dur="3.18">not</text>
  <text start="158.26" dur="5.28">a lot of people don&amp;#39;t realize it you</text>
  <text start="161.05" dur="6.63">know I was an atheist until I was 38</text>
  <text start="163.54" dur="7.199">years old and not only did I not believe</text>
  <text start="167.68" dur="6.38">that I was hearing God&amp;#39;s voice I also of</text>
  <text start="170.739" dur="6.181">course didn&amp;#39;t believe God existed and</text>
  <text start="174.06" dur="5.92">through a rather interesting series of</text>
  <text start="176.92" dur="4.65">divine experiences your Thursday group</text>
  <text start="179.98" dur="4.83">is enjoying the book friend that cool</text>
  <text start="181.57" dur="7.47">awesome it&amp;#39;s a good book for group study</text>
  <text start="184.81" dur="6.92">really is so through a set of</text>
  <text start="189.04" dur="5.73">circumstances back in the year 2000 I</text>
  <text start="191.73" dur="6.28">came to understand that God does exist I</text>
  <text start="194.77" dur="5.79">began suddenly hearing God&amp;#39;s voice very</text>
  <text start="198.01" dur="3.84">clearly and there was no mistake that</text>
  <text start="200.56" dur="2.61">this had to be God because he was</text>
  <text start="201.85" dur="2.85">telling me all kinds of things about me</text>
  <text start="203.17" dur="4.98">that I didn&amp;#39;t know well that I knew that</text>
  <text start="204.7" dur="5.43">he didn&amp;#39;t like I know this stuff how</text>
  <text start="208.15" dur="4.98">does anyone else know this these super</text>
  <text start="210.13" dur="6.74">super secrets about me well God was</text>
  <text start="213.13" dur="8.01">telling me the secrets of my life and</text>
  <text start="216.87" dur="6.67">dragging it all out of the closet he was</text>
  <text start="221.14" dur="3.659">he was convicting me he&amp;#39;s convicting me</text>
  <text start="223.54" dur="4.14">of my sin right and that&amp;#39;s what the</text>
  <text start="224.799" dur="5.491">Bible says the voice of God does the</text>
  <text start="227.68" dur="6.26">Holy Spirit convicts us of sin</text>
  <text start="230.29" dur="7.229">righteousness and judgment right so I</text>
  <text start="233.94" dur="6.97">learned as an atheist about the</text>
  <text start="237.519" dur="4.671">conviction of the Holy Spirit and that</text>
  <text start="240.91" dur="4.68">was an interesting period in my life</text>
  <text start="242.19" dur="7.21">where I went from not believing in God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="245.59" dur="6.149">existence to having to reconcile the</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="3.929">fact that there was this voice speaking</text>
  <text start="251.739" dur="3.5">to me and he was telling me all kinds of</text>
  <text start="253.329" dur="5.13">things that I had done it was also</text>
  <text start="255.239" dur="6.101">telling me about how much he loved me so</text>
  <text start="258.459" dur="6.71">it was a it was a good voice it was the</text>
  <text start="261.34" dur="7.159">voice of a father right God the Father</text>
  <text start="265.169" dur="6.93">his children and he speaks to us in a</text>
  <text start="268.499" dur="6.39">way that encourages us that instructs us</text>
  <text start="272.099" dur="5.82">in righteousness instructs us to live in</text>
  <text start="274.889" dur="6.09">his ways he instructs us to live</text>
  <text start="277.919" dur="4.981">according to the blueprint that he has</text>
  <text start="280.979" dur="3.571">created for us from the very beginning a</text>
  <text start="282.9" dur="4.44">lot of people don&amp;#39;t know this but God</text>
  <text start="284.55" dur="6.57">has created a very detailed plan for</text>
  <text start="287.34" dur="5.759">your life and I have found that one of</text>
  <text start="291.12" dur="4.909">the greatest blessings in life comes</text>
  <text start="293.099" dur="6.301">from learning about his plan for us</text>
  <text start="296.029" dur="4.69">following that blueprint when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.4" dur="3.389">following God&amp;#39;s plan when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.719" dur="5.16">following his blueprint when you</text>
  <text start="302.789" dur="6.421">understand at least parts of your divine</text>
  <text start="305.879" dur="6.391">destiny in your purpose your life tends</text>
  <text start="309.21" dur="4.769">to be amazingly blessed he bring God</text>
  <text start="312.27" dur="3.48">will bring people around to your circle</text>

  <text start="315.75" dur="4.74">encourage you inspire you who will help</text>

  <text start="327.27" dur="6.78">plan his purpose all of the heaven is</text>
  <text start="331.86" dur="4.26">working with you to accomplish that</text>
  <text start="334.05" dur="6.51">purpose when you are walking against</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="7.229">God&amp;#39;s plan you are paddling upstream it</text>
  <text start="340.56" dur="6.329">is it is not easy it&amp;#39;s a difficult life</text>
  <text start="343.349" dur="7.25">I live that way for 38 years paddling</text>
  <text start="346.889" dur="7.231">upstream going against God&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="350.599" dur="8.771">disavowing the idea that God existed</text>
  <text start="354.12" dur="7.469">right that is a very difficult road so</text>
  <text start="359.37" dur="4.109">and that&amp;#39;s how I looked for for you know</text>
  <text start="361.589" dur="6.721">better half of the first half of my life</text>
  <text start="363.479" dur="6.9">I I wanted to do things my own way I</text>
  <text start="368.31" dur="5.479">wanted to be in control of my own</text>
  <text start="370.379" dur="7.111">destiny I wanted to be in control of my</text>
  <text start="373.789" dur="8.41">course of my life make my choices based</text>
  <text start="377.49" dur="6.179">on my understanding on my what I thought</text>
  <text start="382.199" dur="4.68">was it in my own best interest and</text>
  <text start="383.669" dur="6.18">that&amp;#39;s how people tend to live when they</text>
  <text start="386.879" dur="4.59">are not aware that God is speaking to</text>
  <text start="389.849" dur="4.53">them when they deny the existence of God</text>
  <text start="391.469" dur="5.901">if you want to live life on your own</text>
  <text start="394.379" dur="4.141">terms the easiest thing to do is to just</text>
  <text start="397.37" dur="3.46">say</text>
  <text start="398.52" dur="5.88">either God doesn&amp;#39;t exist or that God is</text>
  <text start="400.83" dur="8.73">not a personal God who has an interest</text>
  <text start="404.4" dur="7.229">in your life and any influence so a lot</text>
  <text start="409.56" dur="4.919">of people who are sort of agnostic or</text>
  <text start="411.629" dur="5.1">have different belief systems they talk</text>
  <text start="414.479" dur="5.571">about God in a general sense in this</text>
  <text start="416.729" dur="7.521">nebulous God like you know deity creator</text>
  <text start="420.05" dur="8.29">whatever you want to call it they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.25" dur="9.009">admit don&amp;#39;t acknowledge that God is a</text>
  <text start="428.34" dur="9.54">personal God who has a specific plan for</text>
  <text start="433.259" dur="6.75">you that he cares for you and they</text>
  <text start="437.88" dur="4.68">certainly would not agree that God</text>
  <text start="440.009" dur="6.331">became a man and died for us to redeem</text>
  <text start="442.56" dur="7.38">us right well I found out about that I</text>
  <text start="446.34" dur="8.699">found out that God did become a man did</text>
  <text start="449.94" dur="8.039">live a life that represented the</text>
  <text start="455.039" dur="6.211">ultimate in love and then died for us to</text>
  <text start="457.979" dur="5.43">redeem us from the curse of sin right</text>
  <text start="461.25" dur="6.68">that was a very hard pill for me to</text>
  <text start="463.409" dur="8.521">swallow being an atheist but once I</text>
  <text start="467.93" dur="8.289">swallowed the red pill the the Jesus</text>
  <text start="471.93" dur="6.299">pill everything in my life changed I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="476.219" dur="4.26">not going to say that my entire life has</text>
  <text start="478.229" dur="4.59">been bed of roses because there are a</text>
  <text start="480.479" dur="5.671">lot of thorns in that bed of roses and I</text>
  <text start="482.819" dur="7.53">have found those thorns but a lot of</text>
  <text start="486.15" dur="7.259">that the after I became a Christian for</text>
  <text start="490.349" dur="6.961">the first seven years afterward my life</text>
  <text start="493.409" dur="5.641">was very difficult but through that</text>
  <text start="497.31" dur="4.02">process God was teaching the obedience</text>
  <text start="499.05" dur="5.04">he was teaching me the blessing of a</text>
  <text start="501.33" dur="4.53">bees and not not like here&amp;#39;s my law I</text>
  <text start="504.09" dur="4.53">don&amp;#39;t want you to ever disobey any of</text>
  <text start="505.86" dur="5.91">these things you know you follow all the</text>
  <text start="508.62" dur="5.279">Old Testament Commandments and try to</text>
  <text start="511.77" dur="3.42">follow the Levitical law to the letter</text>
  <text start="513.899" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s not what that&amp;#39;s not what</text>
  <text start="515.19" dur="9.72">obedience is for me and I found this out</text>
  <text start="519.659" dur="7.891">many years later for me the the real</text>
  <text start="524.91" dur="5.1">blessing and obedience is understanding</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="3.85">that God has a amazing plan for you he</text>
  <text start="530.01" dur="5.17">has an amazing</text>
  <text start="531.4" dur="7.2">a blueprint he&amp;#39;s given you talents</text>
  <text start="535.18" dur="5.49">abilities and gifts and he wants you to</text>
  <text start="538.6" dur="5.85">use those talents abilities and gifts in</text>
  <text start="540.67" dur="5.58">a way that positively influences the</text>
  <text start="544.45" dur="4.55">culture your family your friends in your</text>
  <text start="546.25" dur="5.67">workplace and I didn&amp;#39;t know that I</text>
  <text start="549" dur="5.56">thought at first it was going to be</text>
  <text start="551.92" dur="3.57">obeying the commandments don&amp;#39;t do this</text>
  <text start="554.56" dur="3.29">don&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="6.48">lots of rigid rules following rules</text>
  <text start="557.85" dur="7.12">there was some of that and when I first</text>
  <text start="561.97" dur="8.88">heard the voice of God God was telling</text>
  <text start="564.97" dur="8.07">me don&amp;#39;t be a jackass to that person hmm</text>
  <text start="570.85" dur="5.37">he told me be nice to this person be</text>
  <text start="573.04" dur="5.04">kind be encouraging to the people at the</text>
  <text start="576.22" dur="7.83">fire station where I was working he was</text>
  <text start="578.08" dur="8.58">instructing me in how to change my</text>
  <text start="584.05" dur="4.23">perspective how to change the way in</text>
  <text start="586.66" dur="5.63">which I dealt with people because I had</text>
  <text start="588.28" dur="4.01">always been kind of a sarcastic</text>
  <text start="593.37" dur="6.13">sometimes very cutting very not very</text>
  <text start="597.64" dur="5.22">loving and compassionate person toward</text>
  <text start="599.5" dur="4.83">others and after I became a Christian</text>
  <text start="602.86" dur="3.84">one of the first things that God started</text>
  <text start="604.33" dur="4.38">to do as I heard his voice was he was</text>
  <text start="606.7" dur="5.57">correcting my behavior who&amp;#39;s correcting</text>
  <text start="608.71" dur="7.53">my attitude correcting the negative</text>
  <text start="612.27" dur="8.2">harsh critical way that I dealt with</text>
  <text start="616.24" dur="5.58">people and he was doing that because he</text>
  <text start="620.47" dur="3.03">wanted me to become a more loving</text>
  <text start="621.82" dur="4.02">compassionate person I mean it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="623.5" dur="4.32">simple and I had to admit that I was</text>
  <text start="625.84" dur="3.75">hearing God&amp;#39;s voice because I I would</text>
  <text start="627.82" dur="4.02">just hear this in my conscience I would</text>
  <text start="629.59" dur="4.47">hear don&amp;#39;t do this don&amp;#39;t do that don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="631.84" dur="8.39">say this be nice be kind in my</text>
  <text start="634.06" dur="12.18">conscience I heard this voice right now</text>
  <text start="640.23" dur="10">we all have a conscience we all have</text>
  <text start="646.24" dur="6.5">this internal voice that is reminding us</text>
  <text start="650.23" dur="7.26">that stealing is wrong</text>
  <text start="652.74" dur="8.77">that lying is wrong that treating other</text>
  <text start="657.49" dur="6.38">people unkindly and rudely is wrong when</text>
  <text start="661.51" dur="4.4">you do those things you can</text>
  <text start="663.87" dur="4.05">your consciousness kind of nas at you a</text>
  <text start="665.91" dur="3.24">little bit and you&amp;#39;re like oh gosh I</text>
  <text start="667.92" dur="1.74">shouldn&amp;#39;t have said that shouldn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="669.15" dur="3.72">done that</text>
  <text start="669.66" dur="3.54">you know if you steal $25 from your</text>
  <text start="672.87" dur="3.21">mother</text>
  <text start="673.2" dur="4.8">it eventually your conscience is going</text>
  <text start="676.08" dur="6.42">to tell you you know that was wrong to</text>
  <text start="678" dur="6.839">do that right well our conscience is the</text>
  <text start="682.5" dur="4.17">way in which God&amp;#39;s one of the ways in</text>
  <text start="684.839" dur="7.531">which God speaks to us right</text>
  <text start="686.67" dur="8.31">so Paul wrote in Romans chapter 2 this</text>
  <text start="692.37" dur="5.04">is New Living Translation even the</text>
  <text start="694.98" dur="4.23">Gentiles right so Paul is a Jew and he</text>
  <text start="697.41" dur="4.83">was writing about the Gentiles who don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="699.21" dur="6.09">have the law even the Gentiles who do</text>
  <text start="702.24" dur="4.86">not have God&amp;#39;s law written show that</text>
  <text start="705.3" dur="5.37">they know his law when they</text>
  <text start="707.1" dur="6.75">instinctively obey it even without</text>
  <text start="710.67" dur="5.48">having the law they demonstrate that</text>
  <text start="713.85" dur="5.1">God&amp;#39;s law is written in their hearts for</text>
  <text start="716.15" dur="5.17">their own conscience and thoughts either</text>
  <text start="718.95" dur="5.4">accuse them or tell them they are doing</text>
  <text start="721.32" dur="6.51">right so Paul was arguing in Romans that</text>

  <text start="983.47" dur="5.55">I might jot that down on a notepad and</text>
  <text start="986.86" dur="4.47">then I&amp;#39;ll think about that for a while</text>

  <text start="996.61" dur="3.78">actually let me give you an example so</text>
  <text start="998.41" dur="5.52">last night I had a very interesting</text>

  <text start="1003.93" dur="10.23">dreams that came one after another and</text>

  <text start="1022.08" dur="4.8">dream was about because I&amp;#39;d been</text>
  <text start="1023.58" dur="6.87">thinking about this for the last four</text>
  <text start="1026.88" dur="7.82">months ever since I read a book by CS</text>

  <text start="1039.42" dur="9.27">I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this idea based</text>

  <text start="1076.95" dur="6.24">understood this series of dreams to be</text>

  <text start="2506.74" dur="3.9">do I figure that out you just do the</text>
  <text start="2508.42" dur="5.04">emotional healing just do the emotional</text>

  <text start="2513.46" dur="8.31">know it was related to emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="2517.109" dur="6.161">it could also be physiological you would</text>
  <text start="2521.77" dur="4.62">have to see a doctor and get you know</text>
  <text start="2523.27" dur="3.9">x-rays and tests but even then some</text>
  <text start="2526.39" dur="5.76">people have</text>
  <text start="2527.17" dur="9.6">radiologic changes and that&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="2532.15" dur="7.32">actually the cause of their pain Denise</text>

  <text start="2544.81" dur="5.13">and they showed the bulging discs and we</text>
  <text start="2547.75" dur="5.46">got her healed we never had the x-rays</text>
  <text start="2549.94" dur="6.42">or MRI done afterward so we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2553.21" dur="6.02">if she still has bulging discs or not</text>
  <text start="2556.36" dur="7.2">because she never had follow-up</text>
  <text start="2559.23" dur="7.15">radiology so what I would say is if a</text>
  <text start="2563.56" dur="6.8">doctor tells you whatever you&amp;#39;ve got</text>
