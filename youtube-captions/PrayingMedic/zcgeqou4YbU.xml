  <text start="9.63" dur="7.17">analysis by Alan Dershowitz and Andrew</text>
  <text start="12.389" dur="8.31">McCarthy you just want the mass arrests</text>
  <text start="16.8" dur="5.489">already right well it&amp;#39;s coming I was</text>
  <text start="20.699" dur="5.371">noticing some of the blue checks on</text>
  <text start="22.289" dur="6.06">Twitter are starting to tweet about this</text>
  <text start="26.07" dur="5.129">mass arrests of people in Congress</text>
  <text start="28.349" dur="4.62">coming I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s fake news I</text>
  <text start="31.199" dur="3.901">don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s legit but I will</text>
  <text start="32.969" dur="5.041">say this I&amp;#39;ve been looking at what</text>

  <text start="40.68" dur="6.51">suspect if there&amp;#39;s going to be a large</text>
  <text start="42.6" dur="6.51">takedown of people in Congress it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="47.19" dur="5.79">probably going to be related to the Awan</text>
  <text start="49.11" dur="6.99">brothers scandal the ones have been</text>
  <text start="52.98" dur="5.969">working for a lot of Democrat I believe</text>

  <text start="58.949" dur="3.991">that thing goes down when it blows up it</text>
  <text start="61.71" dur="3.779">is going to take a lot of people down</text>
  <text start="62.94" dur="5.87">the ones should never have been involved</text>
  <text start="65.489" dur="5.791">in any of the IT works in Congress and</text>
  <text start="68.81" dur="4.809">there&amp;#39;s a lot of gathering evidence and</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="3.24">the FBI is investigating it the house is</text>
  <text start="73.619" dur="4.11">investigating it</text>
  <text start="74.52" dur="8.88">so yeah you need to be patient you need</text>
  <text start="77.729" dur="10.621">to be patient it&amp;#39;s coming so I had a</text>
  <text start="83.4" dur="7.74">dream last night and I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="88.35" dur="5.67">tell you the entire contents of the</text>
  <text start="91.14" dur="8.13">dream I will say this Andrew McCarthy</text>
  <text start="94.02" dur="9.239">and I were in in the dream and the dream</text>
  <text start="99.27" dur="6.54">gave me some confirmation that as far as</text>
  <text start="103.259" dur="4.351">God is concerned anyway I believe I&amp;#39;m on</text>
  <text start="105.81" dur="5.16">the right track with following Edgar</text>
  <text start="107.61" dur="4.92">McCarthy and following where he&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="110.97" dur="4.71">with this whole thing with the Muller</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="4.199">investigation so I&amp;#39;m going to continue</text>
  <text start="115.68" dur="3.84">and I&amp;#39;m going to pick up where we left</text>
  <text start="116.729" dur="6.03">off yesterday if you&amp;#39;re with me on my</text>
  <text start="119.52" dur="6.51">last broadcast we talked about the NBC</text>
  <text start="122.759" dur="7.131">report saying that the Muller</text>
  <text start="126.03" dur="5.7">investigation has turned toward an</text>
  <text start="129.89" dur="3.91">investigation to find out if the</text>
  <text start="131.73" dur="6.12">president obstructed justice</text>
  <text start="133.8" dur="5.79">and if look the holidays are coming</text>
  <text start="137.85" dur="5.7">right christmas is coming you&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="139.59" dur="6">be sitting around the Christmas tree</text>
  <text start="143.55" dur="4.23">with your family and friends talking</text>
  <text start="145.59" dur="3.72">about well what&amp;#39;s going on at the</text>
  <text start="147.78" dur="3.96">investigation into Russia and the</text>
  <text start="149.31" dur="4.83">president would you like to have some</text>
  <text start="151.74" dur="4.89">good information that you can take to</text>
  <text start="154.14" dur="4.26">the discussion where you can explain to</text>
  <text start="156.63" dur="5.4">people what&amp;#39;s really going on and what</text>
  <text start="158.4" dur="5.43">the chances are of Muller charging the</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="4.11">president with obstruction and actually</text>
  <text start="163.83" dur="5.34">having that charge stick I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="166.14" dur="6.59">give you today some what I think is very</text>
  <text start="169.17" dur="5.49">good legal analysis from two really good</text>
  <text start="172.73" dur="2.65">attorneys who know what they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="174.66" dur="4.08">about</text>
  <text start="175.38" dur="5.82">Andrew McCarthy former prosecuting</text>
  <text start="178.74" dur="5.67">attorney with Department of Justice Alan</text>
  <text start="181.2" dur="5.04">Dershowitz Harvard Law Professor both</text>
  <text start="184.41" dur="5.94">well-respected and Gershowitz by the way</text>
  <text start="186.24" dur="7.2">is is a liberal and Dershowitz has been</text>
  <text start="190.35" dur="6.84">taking a lot of heat from his liberal</text>
  <text start="193.44" dur="5.81">friends because he is analyzing this</text>
  <text start="197.19" dur="5.76">whole thing with Muller and Trump and</text>
  <text start="199.25" dur="6.16">giving legal opinion on what is going on</text>
  <text start="202.95" dur="4.77">and his liberal friends do not like his</text>
  <text start="205.41" dur="4.5">opinions and he has lost apparently a</text>
  <text start="207.72" dur="4.32">lot of friends over this whole thing</text>
  <text start="209.91" dur="4.62">because even though he has a liberal</text>
  <text start="212.04" dur="4.77">point of view he can see that some of</text>
  <text start="214.53" dur="4.89">the things that are going on here don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="216.81" dur="4.74">hold water from a legal standpoint so</text>
  <text start="219.42" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re gonna look at what Dershowitz has</text>
  <text start="221.55" dur="6.78">to say but first we&amp;#39;re going to look at</text>
  <text start="224.25" dur="5.73">what Andrew McCarthy has to say about it</text>
  <text start="228.33" dur="5.34">and this is in one of his more recent</text>
  <text start="229.98" dur="7.59">articles and I&amp;#39;m going to kind of walk</text>
  <text start="233.67" dur="5.43">you through what Andrew McCarthy sees as</text>
  <text start="237.57" dur="5.22">far as a direction of Mahler&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="239.1" dur="6.84">investigation what we know about his</text>
  <text start="242.79" dur="7.79">investigation based on the mana fort and</text>
  <text start="245.94" dur="7.38">the Flynn charges that were brought so</text>
  <text start="250.58" dur="4.84">McCarthy starts out this article and the</text>
  <text start="253.32" dur="3.57">article is called and I tweeted it&amp;#39;s on</text>
  <text start="255.42" dur="4.62">my Twitter timeline if you want to go</text>
  <text start="256.89" dur="6.839">look at it it&amp;#39;s called it is now an</text>
  <text start="260.04" dur="6.96">obstruction investigation subtitle is</text>
  <text start="263.729" dur="7.891">that means it&amp;#39;s an impeachment and</text>
  <text start="267" dur="6.26">negation all right so McCarthy says</text>
  <text start="271.62" dur="5.58">there&amp;#39;s a lot of misinformation and</text>
  <text start="273.26" dur="5.86">misunderstanding about how a prosecuting</text>
  <text start="277.2" dur="5.22">attorney or a special counsel would</text>
  <text start="279.12" dur="7.55">approach a prosecution and setting up</text>
  <text start="282.42" dur="7.47">witnesses in bringing a case to trial</text>
  <text start="286.67" dur="6.22">this is what he says many analysts are</text>
  <text start="289.89" dur="5.16">under the misimpression that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="292.89" dur="5.82">typical for federal prosecutors to</text>
  <text start="295.05" dur="6.18">accept guilty pleas on minor charges in</text>
  <text start="298.71" dur="6.99">exchange for cooperation that builds a</text>
  <text start="301.23" dur="7.2">case on major charges from this flawed</text>
  <text start="305.7" dur="4.74">premise they reason that Muller is</text>
  <text start="308.43" dur="6.12">methodically constructing a major case</text>
  <text start="310.44" dur="7.62">on Trump by accepting a minor plea on</text>
  <text start="314.55" dur="6.44">Mike Flynn and George papadopolis for</text>
  <text start="318.06" dur="6.21">making false statements to the FBI and</text>
  <text start="320.99" dur="5.47">indicted Paul Manafort on associate</text>
  <text start="324.27" dur="6.06">charges that have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="326.46" dur="7.65">Trump or the election and McCarthy says</text>
  <text start="330.33" dur="5.79">this is not how it works either legally</text>
  <text start="334.11" dur="6.24">or strategically this is not how you do</text>
  <text start="336.12" dur="8.15">it so he says here&amp;#39;s how it actually</text>
  <text start="340.35" dur="6.93">works if a prosecutor has an accomplice</text>
  <text start="344.27" dur="5.56">cooperator who gives the government</text>
  <text start="347.28" dur="5.12">incriminating information about a major</text>
  <text start="349.83" dur="5.25">scheme under investigation</text>
  <text start="352.4" dur="5.92">he pressures the accomplice to plead</text>
  <text start="355.08" dur="6.12">guilty to the major scheme not to some</text>
  <text start="358.32" dur="5.57">ancillary process crime and particularly</text>
  <text start="361.2" dur="5.25">not to false statement charges</text>
  <text start="363.89" dur="6.31">strategically and for public relations</text>
  <text start="366.45" dur="6.99">purposes a guilty plea to the major</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="6.41">scheme under investigation proves that</text>
  <text start="373.44" dur="5.67">the major scheme actually happened in</text>
  <text start="376.61" dur="4.809">this case some kind of criminal</text>
  <text start="379.11" dur="5.7">collusion or conspiracy and Russia&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.419" dur="4.681">espionage operation against the 2016</text>
  <text start="384.81" dur="4.44">election is what they&amp;#39;re trying to prove</text>
  <text start="386.1" dur="6.75">a guilty plea in which the accomplice</text>
  <text start="389.25" dur="6.18">explains to the court what he did to</text>
  <text start="392.85" dur="5.73">help carry out the scheme puts enormous</text>
  <text start="395.43" dur="5.099">pressure on other accomplices to come</text>
  <text start="398.58" dur="4.739">forward and cooperate</text>
  <text start="400.529" dur="5.58">in a political corruption case it can</text>
  <text start="403.319" dur="5.16">drive officials out of office Justice</text>
  <text start="406.109" dur="4.38">Department policy calls for prosecutors</text>
  <text start="408.479" dur="5.67">to indict a defendant on the most</text>
  <text start="410.489" dur="7.05">serious provable charge not to plead out</text>
  <text start="414.149" dur="6.47">a case to minor charges if they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="417.539" dur="6.42">to obtain cooperation from the witness</text>
  <text start="420.619" dur="6.22">the federal sentencing guidelines also</text>
  <text start="423.959" dur="6.29">encourage this they allow a judge to</text>
  <text start="426.839" dur="6.57">sentence the defendant below the harsh</text>

  <text start="436.019" dur="5.73">cooperator gets as little as 0 jail time</text>
  <text start="438.719" dur="5.4">or if time served no matter how serious</text>
  <text start="441.749" dur="5.16">the charge might be this sentencing</text>
  <text start="444.119" dur="4.59">leniency only happens if the defendant</text>
  <text start="446.909" dur="3.78">pleads guilty and if they provide</text>
  <text start="448.709" dur="6.78">substantial assistance to the</text>
  <text start="450.689" dur="7.32">investigation that is what enables a</text>
  <text start="455.489" dur="4.89">prosecutor to entice an accomplice to</text>
  <text start="458.009" dur="4.71">cooperate with the investigation the</text>
  <text start="460.379" dur="4.92">prosecutor doesn&amp;#39;t have to entice the</text>
  <text start="462.719" dur="4.8">cooperation by pleading out some minor</text>
  <text start="465.299" dur="4.74">charge what they do is they plead you to</text>
  <text start="467.519" dur="4.71">a major charge and then tell you you can</text>
  <text start="470.039" dur="6.6">get reduced time or no time or time</text>
  <text start="472.229" dur="7.35">served as your punishment so what the</text>
  <text start="476.639" dur="5.16">DOJ is typically their strategy is to</text>
  <text start="479.579" dur="4.26">get witnesses to cooperate with the</text>
  <text start="481.799" dur="5.15">investigation and plead to the most</text>
  <text start="483.839" dur="7.23">serious crime all right</text>
  <text start="486.949" dur="6.88">the practice of pressuring a guilty plea</text>
  <text start="491.069" dur="6.99">to the major charge makes the accomplice</text>
  <text start="493.829" dur="6.12">a formidable witness in a trial the jury</text>
  <text start="498.059" dur="4.49">knows that he&amp;#39;s facing a potential</text>

  <text start="502.549" dur="6.07">unless they tell everything they know</text>
  <text start="505.019" dur="5.61">and they tell the truth that is what</text>
  <text start="508.619" dur="4.11">triggers a prosecutor&amp;#39;s obligation to</text>
  <text start="510.629" dur="4.95">file a motion that allows the court to</text>
  <text start="512.729" dur="5.43">sentence them under the guidelines for</text>
  <text start="515.579" dur="6.12">the recommended sentence trading a plea</text>
  <text start="518.159" dur="6.42">on a minor charge for cooperation is</text>
  <text start="521.699" dur="5.37">foolish all it does is damage the</text>
  <text start="524.579" dur="4.771">prosecutor&amp;#39;s case it suggests that the</text>
  <text start="527.069" dur="5.37">cooperator must not have disclosed</text>
  <text start="529.35" dur="4.75">details about the major scheme otherwise</text>
  <text start="532.439" dur="3.88">the prosecutor would have</text>
  <text start="534.1" dur="3.9">charged em with the major scheme it</text>
  <text start="536.319" dur="5.041">implies that the prosecutor is so</text>
  <text start="538" dur="6.569">desperate to make a case on the major</text>

  <text start="553.24" dur="5.19">accomplice on a false statement count</text>
  <text start="555.87" dur="4.51">this establishes that the main thing the</text>
  <text start="558.43" dur="3.23">jury needs to know about the witness is</text>
  <text start="560.38" dur="4.019">that they can&amp;#39;t be trusted</text>
  <text start="561.66" dur="5.979">that&amp;#39;s not how you make someone a strong</text>

  <text start="598.99" dur="6.63">everything they know so this is how a</text>
  <text start="602.949" dur="5.041">prosecuting attorney sets up a case and</text>
  <text start="605.62" dur="4.68">how they work with witnesses they</text>

  <text start="616.66" dur="5.22">light sentence all right</text>
  <text start="618.25" dur="6.839">the bottom line is if the FBI had a</text>
  <text start="621.88" dur="5.73">collusion case of some kind after a year</text>
  <text start="625.089" dur="4.771">of intensive investigation Flynn and</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="5.13">Papadopoulos would have been pressured</text>
  <text start="629.86" dur="6.419">to plead guilty to a very serious charge</text>
  <text start="632.74" dur="5.82">and those offenses would be reflected in</text>
  <text start="636.279" dur="5.521">the charges lodged against Manafort as</text>
  <text start="638.56" dur="4.62">well obviously the pleas and the</text>
  <text start="641.8" dur="4.95">indictment have nothing to do with</text>
  <text start="643.18" dur="7.349">collusion or espionage because Muller</text>
  <text start="646.75" dur="5.939">has no collusion case all right so we</text>
  <text start="650.529" dur="5.521">know that now that Muller has no case</text>
  <text start="652.689" dur="6.031">for collusion against Trump because if</text>
  <text start="656.05" dur="5.639">he would have he would have had metaphor</text>
  <text start="658.72" dur="6">and Papadopoulos and Flynn plead to some</text>
  <text start="661.689" dur="5.041">larger charge the fact that he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="664.72" dur="2.43">tells us it&amp;#39;s not about collusion</text>
  <text start="666.73" dur="3.57">anymore</text>
  <text start="667.15" dur="5.22">for Muller and this is what the NBC</text>
  <text start="670.3" dur="5.58">article that I talked about yesterday my</text>
  <text start="672.37" dur="7.05">last broadcast the NBC article cites</text>
  <text start="675.88" dur="5.73">anonymous sources who are supposedly</text>
  <text start="679.42" dur="3.81">inside the Muller investigation and they</text>
  <text start="681.61" dur="3.87">are reporting that Muller is actually</text>
  <text start="683.23" dur="4.34">looking at charging Trump with</text>
  <text start="685.48" dur="5.19">obstruction of justice and not collusion</text>
  <text start="687.57" dur="5.2">all right so we have two different data</text>

  <text start="692.77" dur="4.5">confirming the same idea that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="695.5" dur="4.23">about collusion it&amp;#39;s about obstruction</text>
  <text start="697.27" dur="6.36">of justice I&amp;#39;m just laying out for you</text>
  <text start="699.73" dur="5.7">now the idea that this if Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="703.63" dur="3.9">investigation continues to go forward</text>
  <text start="705.43" dur="4.85">it&amp;#39;s probably good to go in the</text>
  <text start="707.53" dur="8.37">direction of obstruction of justice okay</text>
  <text start="710.28" dur="8.11">now right and we do not know if Muller</text>
  <text start="715.9" dur="5.7">is a black hat if he is representing the</text>
  <text start="718.39" dur="5.34">deep state or if Muller is a white hat</text>
  <text start="721.6" dur="6.75">in disguise who is actually working with</text>
  <text start="723.73" dur="5.79">Trump my position at this point is we</text>
  <text start="728.35" dur="4.2">really don&amp;#39;t know we don&amp;#39;t have enough</text>
  <text start="729.52" dur="5.34">information I don&amp;#39;t think we do most</text>
  <text start="732.55" dur="4.41">people have taken a position that&amp;#39;s fine</text>
  <text start="734.86" dur="4.89">I don&amp;#39;t think we have enough information</text>
  <text start="736.96" dur="5.63">right now to make that call so let me</text>
  <text start="739.75" dur="5.46">continue with Andrew McCarthy&amp;#39;s analysis</text>
  <text start="742.59" dur="4.3">since there is no collusion case we can</text>
  <text start="745.21" dur="3.93">safely assume Muller is primarily</text>
  <text start="746.89" dur="4.59">scrutinizing President Trump with an eye</text>
  <text start="749.14" dur="6.48">toward making a case for obstructing the</text>
  <text start="751.48" dur="6.33">FBI investigation this also makes sense</text>
  <text start="755.62" dur="5.58">in light of the pleas that have been</text>
  <text start="757.81" dur="5.79">taken obstruction of justice is actually</text>
  <text start="761.2" dur="4.23">a process crime it&amp;#39;s somebody getting</text>
  <text start="763.6" dur="4.44">involved in the investigation and trying</text>
  <text start="765.43" dur="4.52">to obstruct what the FBI is doing in its</text>
  <text start="768.04" dur="4.35">investigation it&amp;#39;s a process crime right</text>
  <text start="769.95" dur="5.41">so McCarthy goes on to argue that</text>
  <text start="772.39" dur="5.4">because Papadopoulos and Flynn were</text>
  <text start="775.36" dur="5.82">charged with processed crimes lying to</text>
  <text start="777.79" dur="6.81">the FBI it&amp;#39;s likely that Muller is also</text>
  <text start="781.18" dur="6.03">trying to charge Trump with a process</text>
  <text start="784.6" dur="5.19">crime obstructing justice because those</text>
  <text start="787.21" dur="5.43">two are related if there was a collusion</text>
  <text start="789.79" dur="4.8">or espionage charge coming that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="792.64" dur="5.51">Flynn and Papadopoulos would have been</text>
  <text start="794.59" dur="3.56">charged with all right</text>
  <text start="798.27" dur="4.8">the president does have a lot of</text>
  <text start="801.33" dur="3.86">constitutional powers and we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="803.07" dur="5.13">talk about that in a minute</text>
  <text start="805.19" dur="6.54">before I move on all right I&amp;#39;ll just</text>
  <text start="808.2" dur="5.91">finish up what Mark McCarthy&amp;#39;s article</text>

  <text start="836.43" dur="7.86">he fired Comey in the midst of an</text>

  <text start="858.839" dur="6.511">what McCarthy says is what they would</text>
  <text start="862.29" dur="4.859">try to do is charge Trump with</text>

  <text start="1030.75" dur="6.31">so Nixon was charged with obstruction of</text>

  <text start="1042.36" dur="6.7">considered in the Muller investigation</text>

  <text start="1076.639" dur="7.02">if you tell them to you can be charged</text>
  <text start="1078.519" dur="7.72">right I think it&amp;#39;s very unlikely that</text>
  <text start="1083.659" dur="4.921">Trump actually told fling to lie to the</text>

  <text start="1366.1" dur="4.56">a really interesting point that</text>
  <text start="1367.72" dur="6">Dershowitz is getting at here Jeff</text>
  <text start="1370.66" dur="4.08">Sessions when he goes into these Senate</text>
  <text start="1373.72" dur="3.57">and House Intelligence Committee</text>
  <text start="1374.74" dur="5.58">meetings they&amp;#39;re always asking sessions</text>
  <text start="1377.29" dur="4.92">these questions about conversations he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1380.32" dur="4.71">had with the president and sessions</text>
  <text start="1382.21" dur="5.76">often refuses to answer these questions</text>
  <text start="1385.03" dur="6.269">and that&amp;#39;s because in addition to being</text>
  <text start="1387.97" dur="9.12">the head prosecutor of the DOJ sessions</text>
  <text start="1391.299" dur="9.361">is Trump&amp;#39;s main legal counsel and they</text>
  <text start="1397.09" dur="5.1">have attorney-client privilege now in</text>
  <text start="1400.66" dur="4.08">Great Britain that would not be the case</text>
  <text start="1402.19" dur="4.4">because the prosecutor&amp;#39;s office is</text>
  <text start="1404.74" dur="5.37">separate from the prime minister but</text>
  <text start="1406.59" dur="5.68">because we have the FBI and the DOJ are</text>
  <text start="1410.11" dur="4.319">part of the executive branch the</text>
  <text start="1412.27" dur="5.22">president is their boss the president</text>
  <text start="1414.429" dur="5.88">can tell them who to prosecute he can</text>
  <text start="1417.49" dur="4.71">fire them he can hire them he can direct</text>
  <text start="1420.309" dur="6.811">all that and that is perfectly allowed</text>
  <text start="1422.2" dur="6.27">by the Constitution and Dershowitz</text>
  <text start="1427.12" dur="3.299">argues we would probably be better off</text>
  <text start="1428.47" dur="6.03">if that weren&amp;#39;t the case but that is the</text>
  <text start="1430.419" dur="6.211">case assume for the sake of argument</text>
  <text start="1434.5" dur="5.07">that the president had said the</text>
  <text start="1436.63" dur="5.549">following to Comey you are no longer</text>
  <text start="1439.57" dur="6.14">authorized to investigate Flynn because</text>
  <text start="1442.179" dur="5.611">I&amp;#39;ve decided to pardon him would that</text>
  <text start="1445.71" dur="4.44">exercise of the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1447.79" dur="5.009">constitutional power to pardon</text>
  <text start="1450.15" dur="5.64">constitute a criminal obstruction of</text>
  <text start="1452.799" dur="5.221">justice of course not</text>
  <text start="1455.79" dur="4.81">presidents do that all the time the</text>
  <text start="1458.02" dur="4.59">first president Bush pardoned Caspar</text>

  <text start="1462.61" dur="3.84">the middle of an investigation that</text>
  <text start="1464.38" dur="4.02">could have incriminated Bush</text>
  <text start="1466.45" dur="4.32">that was not an obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="1468.4" dur="5.49">and neither would the pardon of Flynn</text>
  <text start="1470.77" dur="4.5">have been a crime a president cannot be</text>
  <text start="1473.89" dur="3.39">charged with the crime</text>
  <text start="1475.27" dur="4.29">for properly exercising their</text>
  <text start="1477.28" dur="4.56">constitutional authority for the same</text>
  <text start="1479.56" dur="3.93">reason President Trump cannot be charged</text>
  <text start="1481.84" dur="3.63">with obstruction for firing Comey</text>
  <text start="1483.49" dur="5.28">which he had the constitutional</text>
  <text start="1485.47" dur="5.43">authority to do commis own statements</text>
  <text start="1488.77" dur="4.56">suggest that one reason the president</text>
  <text start="1490.9" dur="4.44">fired him was because of his refusal or</text>
  <text start="1493.33" dur="4.31">failure to publicly announce that the</text>
  <text start="1495.34" dur="4.89">FBI wasn&amp;#39;t investigating him personally</text>
  <text start="1497.64" dur="3.88">Trump repeatedly told Comey hey why</text>
  <text start="1500.23" dur="2.73">don&amp;#39;t you get that fact out why don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1501.52" dur="3.69">you tell the people that I&amp;#39;m not under</text>
  <text start="1502.96" dur="3.74">investigation again that is not</text>
  <text start="1505.21" dur="4.89">obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="1506.7" dur="5.89">Dershowitz goes on to wrap up his</text>
  <text start="1510.1" dur="5.01">summary but basically says there is</text>
  <text start="1512.59" dur="5.7">nothing as far as we know in what Trump</text>
  <text start="1515.11" dur="5.73">has said and done with respect to Flynn</text>
  <text start="1518.29" dur="7.65">and the Russia investigation that would</text>
  <text start="1520.84" dur="7.1">give Muller any legitimate basis to</text>
  <text start="1525.94" dur="5.46">charge him with obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="1527.94" dur="10.33">all Trump has done is exercise his</text>
  <text start="1531.4" dur="8.94">constitutional powers and that is for</text>
  <text start="1538.27" dur="5.16">the coming weeks as Muller&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1540.34" dur="5.4">investigation continues as we get more</text>
  <text start="1543.43" dur="4.14">information and as we find out more</text>
  <text start="1545.74" dur="4.41">about what what Muller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="1547.57" dur="5.79">is doing I think it&amp;#39;s good to just keep</text>
  <text start="1550.15" dur="5.61">in mind the fact that it seems from two</text>
  <text start="1553.36" dur="5.28">very good legal experts it seems very</text>
  <text start="1555.76" dur="5.25">unlikely that Muller is going to make</text>
  <text start="1558.64" dur="4.71">any charge of obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="1561.01" dur="3.66">stick against the president it just</text>
  <text start="1563.35" dur="5.43">doesn&amp;#39;t seem like there&amp;#39;s a good legal</text>
  <text start="1564.67" dur="5.85">basis for it for the coming years right</text>
  <text start="1568.78" dur="3.48">I mean I&amp;#39;m kind of working on the</text>
  <text start="1570.52" dur="4.05">assumption that Muller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="1572.26" dur="4.14">is gonna be wrapping up soon Trump said</text>
  <text start="1574.57" dur="3.06">that he believes commis investigation</text>
  <text start="1576.4" dur="3.66">will be done by the end of the year</text>
  <text start="1577.63" dur="3.69">some people believe Muller is gonna sit</text>
  <text start="1580.06" dur="3.03">around for another year or two and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1581.32" dur="6.14">gonna just keep on investigating people</text>
  <text start="1583.09" dur="8.94">and keep on making money I don&amp;#39;t know I</text>
  <text start="1587.46" dur="6.61">don&amp;#39;t know but I would say that I think</text>
  <text start="1592.03" dur="5.49">we can all have a little bit of peace</text>
  <text start="1594.07" dur="5.27">over this in knowing that some very good</text>
  <text start="1597.52" dur="4.16">legal experts have looked at</text>
  <text start="1599.34" dur="7.31">this and said really there isn&amp;#39;t a whole</text>
  <text start="1601.68" dur="8.7">lot of that Muller could do legitimately</text>
  <text start="1606.65" dur="6.07">to hurt the president unless it&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="1610.38" dur="4.53">to try to give Congress another reason</text>
  <text start="1612.72" dur="5.43">to try to impeach him and even if</text>
  <text start="1614.91" dur="5.6">Congress does vote to impeach the</text>
  <text start="1618.15" dur="6.75">president again like they did last week</text>
  <text start="1620.51" dur="7.09">probably won&amp;#39;t work one of the things</text>
  <text start="1624.9" dur="5.67">that I see that is seems to indicate</text>
  <text start="1627.6" dur="7.95">that the president is gaining favor</text>
  <text start="1630.57" dur="10.22">among Congress is Mitch McConnell is no</text>
  <text start="1635.55" dur="8.34">longer pushing back and obstructing what</text>
  <text start="1640.79" dur="7.45">the president wants to do and in the</text>
  <text start="1643.89" dur="10.13">last week Paul Ryan has taken the</text>
  <text start="1648.24" dur="9.74">president&amp;#39;s side on daca and the budget</text>
  <text start="1654.02" dur="7.09">Paul Ryan said a week ago that when</text>
  <text start="1657.98" dur="5.35">Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer refused</text>
  <text start="1661.11" dur="3.45">to show up at the meeting with the</text>
  <text start="1663.33" dur="4.44">president over the budget</text>
  <text start="1664.56" dur="4.56">he said daca is now off the table</text>
  <text start="1667.77" dur="4.26">because you didn&amp;#39;t show up at the</text>
  <text start="1669.12" dur="5.67">meeting daca is off the table we are not</text>
  <text start="1672.03" dur="4.98">putting daca in this budget it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1674.79" dur="3.84">going to happen and when I first read</text>
  <text start="1677.01" dur="4.29">that article I thought wow that&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1678.63" dur="4.14">unusual for Paul Ryan to take that</text>
  <text start="1681.3" dur="5.01">because Ryan has been entertaining</text>
  <text start="1682.77" dur="5.1">everything that Nancy and Chuck have</text>
  <text start="1686.31" dur="4.86">wanted for a long time but all of a</text>
  <text start="1687.87" dur="5.22">sudden Ryan is now taking a stance and</text>
  <text start="1691.17" dur="5.01">he&amp;#39;s backing the president and today</text>
  <text start="1693.09" dur="5.67">he&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s an article that Ryan has</text>
  <text start="1696.18" dur="4.29">again said daca is not going to be</text>
  <text start="1698.76" dur="4.2">discussed in the budget they can talk</text>
  <text start="1700.47" dur="5.42">about it next year in March it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="1702.96" dur="5.61">gonna be involved in the budget talks so</text>
  <text start="1705.89" dur="5.65">what I see is a lot of congressional</text>
  <text start="1708.57" dur="6.15">leaders who seem to be they recognize</text>
  <text start="1711.54" dur="5.79">that Trump has the wind at his back and</text>
  <text start="1714.72" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re now getting on I don&amp;#39;t know if</text>
  <text start="1717.33" dur="4.08">they&amp;#39;re getting on the Trump train but</text>
  <text start="1719.13" dur="4.23">they seem to be their opposition to what</text>
  <text start="1721.41" dur="5.22">the president wants to do is much less</text>
  <text start="1723.36" dur="5.28">than it was they seem to be you know</text>
  <text start="1726.63" dur="5.68">warming up and cozying up to the</text>
  <text start="1728.64" dur="5.2">president in the last few weeks</text>
  <text start="1732.31" dur="4.44">and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a coincidence</text>
  <text start="1733.84" dur="4.59">that this has all happened as people</text>
  <text start="1736.75" dur="6.21">have been stepping down from Congress</text>
  <text start="1738.43" dur="9.12">I made sexual scandals I suspect that</text>
  <text start="1742.96" dur="5.76">Paul Ryan knows more congressional more</text>
  <text start="1747.55" dur="6.59">representatives are gonna be stepping</text>
  <text start="1748.72" dur="9.42">down because of the scandals and I think</text>
  <text start="1754.14" dur="6.52">Ryan knows that Trump is playing his</text>
  <text start="1758.14" dur="4.71">hand and he has the goods on a lot of</text>
  <text start="1760.66" dur="5.19">dirty people and I think Ryan has now</text>
  <text start="1762.85" dur="5.07">realized I am NOT gonna stop Trump I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1765.85" dur="4.47">not gonna obstruct him anymore I&amp;#39;m going</text>
  <text start="1767.92" dur="6.03">to go along and get whatever he wants</text>
  <text start="1770.32" dur="6.42">done so I see in what&amp;#39;s going on in</text>
  <text start="1773.95" dur="5.43">Congress more support for the president</text>
  <text start="1776.74" dur="4.68">even though some people are you know</text>
  <text start="1779.38" dur="4.68">this there&amp;#39;s these sexual allegations</text>
  <text start="1781.42" dur="4.77">that came out again from these women I</text>
  <text start="1784.06" dur="4.08">think that will all go away pretty</text>
  <text start="1786.19" dur="5.13">quickly doesn&amp;#39;t seem like there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="1788.14" dur="5.22">of legitimacy to it these these people</text>
  <text start="1791.32" dur="4.8">have been out there for a long time</text>
  <text start="1793.36" dur="5.22">they&amp;#39;re coming forward seems to be</text>
  <text start="1796.12" dur="4.56">politically timed I don&amp;#39;t think it</text>
  <text start="1798.58" dur="6.71">presents a real threat to what Trump is</text>
  <text start="1800.68" dur="7.92">doing so that&amp;#39;s just my my take on it</text>
  <text start="1805.29" dur="5.17">I&amp;#39;m not I&amp;#39;m not saying Paul Ryan isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1808.6" dur="3.93">the swamp creature and Mitch McConnell</text>
  <text start="1810.46" dur="5.42">isn&amp;#39;t the swamp creature they are but</text>
  <text start="1812.53" dur="7.41">look they see the swamp is being drained</text>
  <text start="1815.88" dur="5.5">all right they are looking at what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1819.94" dur="3.18">happening and they&amp;#39;re seeing all these</text>
  <text start="1821.38" dur="4.17">people go down they&amp;#39;re watching the</text>
  <text start="1823.12" dur="4.8">stuff swap being drained and you are a</text>
  <text start="1825.55" dur="4.26">swamp creature you have to decide do I</text>
  <text start="1827.92" dur="4.44">want to go down that drain or do I want</text>
  <text start="1829.81" dur="5.34">to stay in my little swampy job if I do</text>
  <text start="1832.36" dur="5.22">I have to get on board with the guy who</text>
  <text start="1835.15" dur="4.41">is running this operation and I think</text>
  <text start="1837.58" dur="5.37">McConnell and Ryan are smart enough to</text>
  <text start="1839.56" dur="5.16">know Trump has got a good game plan and</text>
  <text start="1842.95" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s gonna win this so they&amp;#39;re getting</text>
  <text start="1844.72" dur="4.02">on his side doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="1846.7" dur="4.83">swampy it just means I think they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1848.74" dur="7.98">recognized who the boss is and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1851.53" dur="9.59">getting in line with the boss so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1856.72" dur="6.96">my view for what it&amp;#39;s worth all right</text>
  <text start="1861.12" dur="4.92">Denise says I have to go shopping with</text>
