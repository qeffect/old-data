  <text start="49.8" dur="8.25">hat tip to epic x for their coverage of</text>
  <text start="54.149" dur="7.881">Spygate and the very cool Spygate</text>
  <text start="58.05" dur="7.38">graphic that I stole this image from and</text>
  <text start="62.03" dur="6.94">repurposed it alright this is from</text>
  <text start="65.43" dur="5.939">December 16th judge Sullivan the United</text>
  <text start="68.97" dur="5.49">Sidney pals motion for Brady material in</text>
  <text start="71.369" dur="5.371">general Flynn&amp;#39;s case the response is</text>
  <text start="74.46" dur="5.19">rather long it&amp;#39;s 99 pages I read through</text>
  <text start="76.74" dur="6.21">a lot of it the judge basically said the</text>
  <text start="79.65" dur="5.25">material that was requested had no</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="6.36">bearing on Flynn&amp;#39;s admission to making</text>
  <text start="84.9" dur="8.969">materially false statements so the order</text>
  <text start="89.31" dur="9.9">for a Brady material was denied let&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="93.869" dur="8.25">see the queue then posted in response to</text>
  <text start="99.21" dur="5.58">that announcement is the same evidence</text>
  <text start="102.119" dur="6.57">to free Flynn currently being used to</text>
  <text start="104.79" dur="7.53">indict others in brackets we have G J</text>
  <text start="108.689" dur="7.82">that usually stands for grand jury so Q</text>
  <text start="112.32" dur="7.619">is suggesting that there is grand jury</text>
  <text start="116.509" dur="5.261">material that cannot be released to</text>
  <text start="119.939" dur="3.96">Sidney Powell to help general Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="121.77" dur="5.07">case however there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text>
  <text start="123.899" dur="7.59">information the Q has dropped lately</text>
  <text start="126.84" dur="7.15">that suggests that the people who went</text>
  <text start="131.489" dur="5.021">after general Flynn may be the first</text>
  <text start="133.99" dur="5.34">indicted and we&amp;#39;ll explain that as we</text>
  <text start="136.51" dur="6.51">move along in this broadcast so the next</text>
  <text start="139.33" dur="7.95">line that Q posted is 302 is in brackets</text>
  <text start="143.02" dur="8.4">underscore mod brackets one count</text>
  <text start="147.28" dur="6.3">all right so 302 is not a small block</text>
  <text start="151.42" dur="5.43">forward engine for your Mustang well it</text>
  <text start="153.58" dur="5.49">is but in Q&amp;#39;s vernacular 302 is an FBI</text>
  <text start="156.85" dur="6.12">302 this report that the FBI fills up</text>
  <text start="159.07" dur="4.8">when they interrogate someone a witness</text>
  <text start="162.97" dur="3.06">or a suspect</text>
  <text start="163.87" dur="6.38">all right we know that general Flynn&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="166.03" dur="8.82">302 was modified he was interviewed by</text>
  <text start="170.25" dur="7.3">Peter struck and Joe Pianka and the F</text>
  <text start="174.85" dur="6.81">one of the big issues that&amp;#39;s going on</text>
  <text start="177.55" dur="6.39">now is first there was some confusion as</text>
  <text start="181.66" dur="6.45">to who actually did the interview and</text>
  <text start="183.94" dur="8.94">who wrote the notes looks like the FBI</text>
  <text start="188.11" dur="7.53">actually misidentified pica and struck</text>
  <text start="192.88" dur="5.88">and had their roles switched so Flint&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="195.64" dur="4.98">302 is modified illegally and Q is</text>
  <text start="198.76" dur="7.55">suggesting that that is going to be a</text>
  <text start="200.62" dur="11.1">one count indictment who listened in in</text>
  <text start="206.31" dur="8.83">brackets to count FISA so once I got the</text>
  <text start="211.72" dur="5.76">FISA warrant to spy on general Flynn</text>
  <text start="215.14" dur="6.63">they listened in to his calls they</text>
  <text start="217.48" dur="8.75">listened in the having obtained a FISA</text>
  <text start="221.77" dur="6.72">illegally therefore we have two counts a</text>
  <text start="226.23" dur="4.51">two-count indictment I believe coming up</text>
  <text start="228.49" dur="4.98">which is what Q is indicating the next</text>
  <text start="230.74" dur="5.16">line is a long series of ellipses</text>
  <text start="233.47" dur="7.38">something is missing and then Q writes</text>
  <text start="235.9" dur="7.32">in brackets six counts so what Q I think</text>
  <text start="240.85" dur="5.36">is suggesting here is there isn&amp;#39;t it</text>
  <text start="243.22" dur="5.01">their grand jury material has been</text>
  <text start="246.21" dur="2.32">presented it&amp;#39;s been presented to a grand</text>
  <text start="248.23" dur="3.54">jury</text>
  <text start="248.53" dur="7.17">grand jury has already returned</text>
  <text start="251.77" dur="6.27">indictments nine counts total one of</text>
  <text start="255.7" dur="5.22">which is for modifying the 302 two</text>
  <text start="258.04" dur="4.62">counts for listening illegally and six</text>
  <text start="260.92" dur="4.44">counts for other things that we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="262.66" dur="4.92">know about yet so Q then writes</text>
  <text start="265.36" dur="6.51">continuing FBI agent</text>
  <text start="267.58" dur="7.17">in brackets one brackets P Flint</text>
  <text start="271.87" dur="7.889">interview I think P probably stands for</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="7.889">joke Bianca FBI agent one normal eight</text>
  <text start="279.759" dur="4.25">Peter struck is indicated as PS so I</text>
  <text start="282.639" dur="4.831">think this is pica</text>
  <text start="284.009" dur="5.38">if FISA warrant was illegally obtained</text>
  <text start="287.47" dur="4.83">if FISA warrant was predicated on</text>
  <text start="289.389" dur="5.43">illegal uncorroborated information if</text>
  <text start="292.3" dur="4.35">the FISA actors purposefully withheld</text>
  <text start="294.819" dur="4.53">exculpatory evidence from the court</text>
  <text start="296.65" dur="4.949">watch what happens next I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="299.349" dur="3.421">gonna see some indictments I think these</text>
  <text start="301.599" dur="4.29">are gonna be the first indictments to</text>
  <text start="302.77" dur="6.48">come from spy gate actually but we&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="305.889" dur="8.75">see alright this is just my explanation</text>
  <text start="309.25" dur="7.77">of all that and as well as that we also</text>
  <text start="314.639" dur="5.08">could see an indictment against James</text>
  <text start="317.02" dur="4.859">Baker this is not the James Baker who</text>
  <text start="319.719" dur="3.931">was a former FBI chief counsel this is</text>
  <text start="321.879" dur="4.47">another James Baker he works in the</text>
  <text start="323.65" dur="5.4">Pentagon office of net assessment where</text>
  <text start="326.349" dur="7.35">Adam Levenger worked and Stephan helper</text>
  <text start="329.05" dur="6.54">worked and Baker is suspected of being</text>
  <text start="333.699" dur="4.171">the guy who illegally leaked general</text>
  <text start="335.59" dur="5.91">Flynn&amp;#39;s phone call to ambassador kis</text>
  <text start="337.87" dur="5.22">lyac to the media so he could also be</text>
  <text start="341.5" dur="7.759">indicted a lot of people that have</text>
  <text start="343.09" dur="8.669">exposure here alright let&amp;#39;s move along</text>
  <text start="349.259" dur="4">covered that all right Q then posted</text>

  <text start="442.759" dur="4.351">about making sure you don&amp;#39;t find about</text>
  <text start="444.65" dur="4.5">the corruption of the politicians that</text>

  <text start="458.12" dur="8.76">to keep the public from seeing the</text>
  <text start="462.229" dur="6.421">exposure of politicians and thank God we</text>
  <text start="466.88" dur="4.649">have Donald Trump who is during this</text>
  <text start="468.65" dur="5.85">wall right</text>
  <text start="471.529" dur="4.95">can you post a link to a GCHQ web page</text>
  <text start="474.5" dur="3.9">that has information about their current</text>
  <text start="476.479" dur="5.49">director Jeremy Fleming who took over</text>
  <text start="478.4" dur="5.78">for as director of GCHQ after Robert</text>
  <text start="481.969" dur="3.331">Hannegan who&amp;#39;s a previous director</text>
  <text start="484.18" dur="2.979">retired</text>
  <text start="485.3" dur="4.829">three days after Donald Trump was</text>
  <text start="487.159" dur="5.01">inaugurated Hannigan had face-to-face</text>
  <text start="490.129" dur="4.081">meetings with John Brennan during spy</text>
  <text start="492.169" dur="8.731">gate operation that was seen as a bit</text>
  <text start="494.21" dur="10.98">unusual because GCHQ is the is analogous</text>
  <text start="500.9" dur="6.569">to n the NSA here in America and it</text>
  <text start="505.19" dur="4.349">would be unusual for the CIA director to</text>
  <text start="507.469" dur="4.23">be meeting with Britain&amp;#39;s director of</text>
  <text start="509.539" dur="5.25">their what would he be equivalent to</text>
  <text start="511.699" dur="7.08">their NSA but I&amp;#39;m guessing that Hannigan</text>
  <text start="514.789" dur="5.701">and Brennan had a lot going on involved</text>
  <text start="518.779" dur="4.17">in spy gate and that&amp;#39;s why Hannigan</text>
  <text start="520.49" dur="4.26">probably resigned after Trump was</text>
  <text start="522.949" dur="6.151">inaugurated because he knew that they</text>
  <text start="524.75" dur="7.89">had failed so Q posted a link to that</text>
  <text start="529.1" dur="5.39">webpage with a profile of Jeremy Fleming</text>
  <text start="532.64" dur="4.4">and said name worth remembering</text>
  <text start="534.49" dur="4.23">ring I&amp;#39;m guessing that Fleming is</text>
  <text start="537.04" dur="3.69">working with the Attorney General bar to</text>
  <text start="538.72" dur="3.78">uncover the criminal activity</text>
  <text start="540.73" dur="4.47">surrounding Spygate if he&amp;#39;s not working</text>
  <text start="542.5" dur="7.05">with bar he is certainly in a difficult</text>
  <text start="545.2" dur="7.53">position since bars and Durham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="549.55" dur="5.33">investigations focus heavily on the</text>
  <text start="552.73" dur="8.52">coordination that was going on in the UK</text>
  <text start="554.88" dur="10.12">all right name to remember let&amp;#39;s see in</text>
  <text start="561.25" dur="5.73">August of last year qsy President Trump</text>
  <text start="565" dur="4.08">was pushing so hard on the FBI and</text>
  <text start="566.98" dur="6.06">Department of Justice not to drop the</text>

  <text start="1198.63" dur="4.32">they tie up all the Senate committees</text>

  <text start="1248.52" dur="6.42">indictments well Hugh has been telling</text>
  <text start="1251.37" dur="5.789">us for a long time prior to arrests</text>
  <text start="1254.94" dur="4.02">prior to indictments being unsealed the</text>
  <text start="1257.159" dur="4.441">public has to be made aware of the</text>

  <text start="1271.53" dur="5.36">about corruption</text>
  <text start="1272.669" dur="6.901">so the congressional hearings have to be</text>
  <text start="1276.89" dur="4.36">held and the public needs to be made</text>
  <text start="1279.57" dur="3.45">more aware of corruption before</text>
  <text start="1281.25" dur="6.63">indictments are unsealed than before</text>
  <text start="1283.02" dur="7.47">arrests happen okay</text>
