  <text start="58.32" dur="3.96">it well and it kind of fits in with the</text>
  <text start="60.149" dur="4.171">dancing because there was a time in my</text>
  <text start="62.28" dur="6.509">life where I wasn&amp;#39;t able to dance and</text>
  <text start="64.32" dur="7.17">there&amp;#39;s I had multiple sclerosis I was</text>
  <text start="68.789" dur="4.681">23 years old five weeks into my marriage</text>
  <text start="71.49" dur="3.72">woke up one morning my right foot was</text>
  <text start="73.47" dur="3.75">asleep and by the end of the day it was</text>
  <text start="75.21" dur="3.57">my whole right side from the from the</text>
  <text start="77.22" dur="4.379">chest down and then the next morning it</text>
  <text start="78.78" dur="4.649">started in the left hands side started</text>
  <text start="81.599" dur="3.27">in the foot by the end of the day I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="83.429" dur="3.75">pins and needles just like when your</text>
  <text start="84.869" dur="5.191">foots asleep just from my chest down and</text>
  <text start="87.179" dur="6.091">I&amp;#39;m starting to lose my equilibrium</text>
  <text start="90.06" dur="4.77">starting to feel woozy not able to stand</text>
  <text start="93.27" dur="2.82">up and just feel like I can&amp;#39;t feel the</text>
  <text start="94.83" dur="3.989">floor it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m walking on cotton</text>
  <text start="96.09" dur="4.05">balls and and all of a sudden the next</text>
  <text start="98.819" dur="3.211">thing you know I&amp;#39;m diagnosed with</text>
  <text start="100.14" dur="4.38">multiple sclerosis and this was a very</text>
  <text start="102.03" dur="5.67">rapid progression of the disease</text>
  <text start="104.52" dur="5.969">yes well within a couple of months we</text>
  <text start="107.7" dur="4.169">went to see the neurologist and he he</text>
  <text start="110.489" dur="3.871">noticed that you know first of all to be</text>
  <text start="111.869" dur="4.681">23 and to be losing your equilibrium the</text>
  <text start="114.36" dur="3.869">way that I was and I was starting to to</text>
  <text start="116.55" dur="6.39">need a wheelchair to kind of help me out</text>
  <text start="118.229" dur="7.14">at times and he even come in to dust did</text>
  <text start="122.94" dur="4.59">he wanted to get our affairs in order he</text>
  <text start="125.369" dur="3.661">said this is progressing so quickly that</text>
  <text start="127.53" dur="5.039">I don&amp;#39;t recommend you having any</text>
  <text start="129.03" dur="5.7">children because ms is incurable right</text>
  <text start="132.569" dur="4.411">pretty much it&amp;#39;s just your muscles waste</text>
  <text start="134.73" dur="4.05">away until you basically die correct</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="3.93">correct you just lose the ability to do</text>
  <text start="138.78" dur="4.65">everything and it turns off in the</text>
  <text start="140.91" dur="5.61">nerves of your brain and the nerves in</text>
  <text start="143.43" dur="4.32">your brain stop synapses or stop sending</text>
  <text start="146.52" dur="4.41">the signals to the rest of your whole</text>
  <text start="147.75" dur="5.069">body and and they can take pictures</text>
  <text start="150.93" dur="3.36">scans of your brain and they can see</text>
  <text start="152.819" dur="3.15">where the MS is originating or where</text>
  <text start="154.29" dur="3.63">it&amp;#39;s attacking and then depending on</text>
  <text start="155.969" dur="4.11">where that&amp;#39;s happening it affects your</text>
  <text start="157.92" dur="4.769">the way that you live life the way that</text>
  <text start="160.079" dur="5.49">you got healed because this was you were</text>
  <text start="162.689" dur="3.33">23 years old and you&amp;#39;re not 23 years old</text>
  <text start="165.569" dur="3.361">anymore</text>
  <text start="166.019" dur="5.28">yeah I&amp;#39;ve been healed for 22 years the</text>
  <text start="168.93" dur="5.309">Lord healed me at the age of 30 so how</text>
  <text start="171.299" dur="5.94">did that happen well I was meeting with</text>
  <text start="174.239" dur="4.711">a group of guys there was like half</text>
  <text start="177.239" dur="3.78">dozen of us or so we would meet before</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="4.17">going to work every morning Wednesday</text>
  <text start="181.019" dur="4.62">morning and we&amp;#39;d get together like it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="183.12" dur="5.369">7:00 in the morning and just kind of we</text>
  <text start="185.639" dur="4.44">would do a little Bible study pray for</text>
  <text start="188.489" dur="3">each other pray about the church we&amp;#39;d</text>
  <text start="190.079" dur="2.731">use the church prayer list and then we</text>
  <text start="191.489" dur="3.961">kind of spice it up each week you know</text>
  <text start="192.81" dur="3.56">stand in a circle or I&amp;#39;d spend time</text>
  <text start="195.45" dur="7.349">together</text>
  <text start="196.37" dur="8.199">yeah the sanctuary oh yeah but but the</text>
  <text start="202.799" dur="5.431">day that this happened it was just like</text>
  <text start="204.569" dur="4.98">any other day I had nothing to tell me</text>
  <text start="208.23" dur="2.459">that anything special was gonna happen I</text>

  <text start="214.919" dur="5.43">God so I was alone I was by myself I</text>
  <text start="218.22" dur="4.62">walked to the front of the church I sat</text>
  <text start="220.349" dur="4.591">down in the front row and when I did my</text>
  <text start="222.84" dur="4.979">hair went straight up it was like static</text>
  <text start="224.94" dur="5.639">electricity and I had been in the</text>
  <text start="227.819" dur="3.901">theater in my college years and and my</text>

  <text start="244.56" dur="3.359">electricity so I&amp;#39;m reaching for metal</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="4.14">and I can&amp;#39;t make it stop and so I sit</text>

  <text start="295.79" dur="3.66">in front of my eyes and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="297.35" dur="4.38">what&amp;#39;s wrong with your brain and I said</text>
  <text start="299.45" dur="3.51">really what&amp;#39;s the word and I expected</text>
  <text start="301.73" dur="3.87">something you know Charlton Heston like</text>
  <text start="302.96" dur="7.17">oh sorry with the Lord and he says Tom</text>

  <text start="310.13" dur="3.57">said mapping I said well that mean he</text>
  <text start="311.63" dur="3.99">says well I asked the Lord he showed me</text>
  <text start="313.7" dur="3.15">a map of the state of Arizona showed me</text>
  <text start="315.62" dur="2.85">a railway system and let&amp;#39;s say it goes</text>
  <text start="316.85" dur="3.6">up from Phoenix up to Flagstaff well</text>
  <text start="318.47" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s gonna go east and go over to</text>
  <text start="320.45" dur="3.27">Albuquerque or it&amp;#39;s gonna go straight up</text>
  <text start="322.07" dur="3.3">north to Utah depending on how the rails</text>
  <text start="323.72" dur="3.66">connect there&amp;#39;s a disconnect in the</text>
  <text start="325.37" dur="3.72">rails of your brain and he didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="327.38" dur="3.42">how MS works but you&amp;#39;ve got a myelin</text>
  <text start="329.09" dur="3.36">sheath that covers your nerve and that</text>
  <text start="330.8" dur="3.87">myelin sheath breaks down they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="332.45" dur="4.62">know why and it causes a disconnect in</text>
  <text start="334.67" dur="4.05">your nerves right and so as he&amp;#39;s saying</text>
  <text start="337.07" dur="3.72">this I&amp;#39;m feeling what&amp;#39;s like warm honey</text>
  <text start="338.72" dur="3.81">coming over the top of my head and this</text>
  <text start="340.79" dur="3.84">warm peaceful honey starts to come over</text>
  <text start="342.53" dur="3.66">my nose and I feel like I&amp;#39;m breathing in</text>
  <text start="344.63" dur="3.72">water and God just speaks to Martin he</text>
  <text start="346.19" dur="3.96">says Tom just relax this is me I got</text>
  <text start="348.35" dur="4.44">this and this yeah this more peaceful</text>
  <text start="350.15" dur="4.53">honey just covers my body and he says</text>
  <text start="352.79" dur="3.06">can I pray for you and he didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="354.68" dur="2.43">anything about what I&amp;#39;d been feeling I</text>
  <text start="355.85" dur="2.31">said well the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s been on me</text>
  <text start="357.11" dur="4.35">all morning you can probably pray</text>
  <text start="358.16" dur="4.95">anything at work go ahead I closed my</text>
  <text start="361.46" dur="3.42">eyes and he prayed a very simple prayer</text>
  <text start="363.11" dur="4.41">and I was like is that gonna work and</text>
  <text start="364.88" dur="4.74">when I opened my eyes for the first time</text>
  <text start="367.52" dur="4.23">in two years I could see clearly because</text>
  <text start="369.62" dur="3.54">the MS had attacked my eyes earlier on I</text>
  <text start="371.75" dur="3.96">actually went through a season of</text>
  <text start="373.16" dur="5.67">blindness and but when it went into</text>
  <text start="375.71" dur="5.46">remission any time I changed rooms from</text>
  <text start="378.83" dur="4.05">one light to one degree of light to</text>
  <text start="381.17" dur="2.93">another my eyes would automatically blur</text>
  <text start="382.88" dur="3.63">and I have to wait for him to readjust</text>
  <text start="384.1" dur="4.09">well and so for the first time in two</text>
  <text start="386.51" dur="4.08">years I opened my eyes and I can see</text>
  <text start="388.19" dur="4.53">totally clear and I go could it be that</text>
  <text start="390.59" dur="3.33">simple and so I get up and this guy</text>
  <text start="392.72" dur="3.51">doesn&amp;#39;t even know what&amp;#39;s up I just get</text>
  <text start="393.92" dur="4.44">up and I run out of the church and I run</text>
  <text start="396.23" dur="3.51">a few blocks away and I run back and</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="2.88">it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ve been training for the</text>
  <text start="399.74" dur="3.21">Olympics it was like I wasn&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="401.24" dur="2.82">winded and I&amp;#39;m jumping up and down and</text>
  <text start="402.95" dur="2.37">the guys are coming at me they&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="404.06" dur="2.37">Tom you shouldn&amp;#39;t do that and I said</text>
  <text start="405.32" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;ve been healed and they said no you</text>
  <text start="406.43" dur="4.38">haven&amp;#39;t and I said oh yes I have and</text>
  <text start="408.38" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s been 22 years and that was really</text>
  <text start="410.81" dur="3.78">interesting too because the MS ed</text>
  <text start="412.76" dur="4.23">progressed to the point where you would</text>
  <text start="414.59" dur="3.36">get winded and exhausted just growing up</text>
  <text start="416.99" dur="1.539">one flight of stairs</text>
  <text start="417.95" dur="2.079">one flight of</text>
  <text start="418.529" dur="3.33">there&amp;#39;s at work my boss knew I needed a</text>
  <text start="420.029" dur="3.6">half-hour nap to recover from it right</text>
  <text start="421.859" dur="3.15">and so you&amp;#39;re extremely weak at that</text>
  <text start="423.629" dur="3.84">point yeah but once you got healed</text>
  <text start="425.009" dur="3.69">you&amp;#39;re ready to run a marathon and so</text>
  <text start="427.469" dur="3.27">when I went to work that day I was</text>
  <text start="428.699" dur="7.29">running up and down the steps is</text>
  <text start="430.739" dur="6.66">probably that&amp;#39;s nothing watch this and</text>
  <text start="435.989" dur="6.24">then I ran around the whole building you</text>
  <text start="437.399" dur="7.83">know well I love that testimony that is</text>
  <text start="442.229" dur="6.03">just so good and I would like to</text>
  <text start="445.229" dur="5.45">encourage people who are listening if</text>
  <text start="448.259" dur="5.82">you have been waiting for healing</text>
  <text start="450.679" dur="5.77">believe that God wants to heal you and</text>
  <text start="454.079" dur="4.77">will heal you and do not give up hope</text>
  <text start="456.449" dur="4.89">and do not get discouraged because</text>
  <text start="458.849" dur="4.2">miracles like this happen all the time</text>
  <text start="461.339" dur="3.75">every day around the world</text>
  <text start="463.049" dur="4.25">I get testimonies from people I see</text>
  <text start="465.089" dur="4.62">people healed you see people healed and</text>

  <text start="469.709" dur="5.88">telling stories here this is the real</text>
  <text start="471.299" dur="7.38">deal Jesus loves to heal people so Tom</text>
  <text start="475.589" dur="5.73">you have been involved in healing for</text>
  <text start="478.679" dur="5.73">quite a long time when healing first</text>
  <text start="481.319" dur="5.22">came to the Phoenix area back with the</text>
  <text start="484.409" dur="4.11">vineyard church origin you were kind of</text>

  <text start="511.199" dur="4.89">tremendous things I&amp;#39;ve read a lot of</text>
  <text start="513.539" dur="4.261">books on healing and I think how we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="516.089" dur="3.151">healing by John Wimber is one of my</text>
  <text start="517.8" dur="3.389">all-time favourite books on healing</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="5.18">you know how John goes through his own</text>
  <text start="521.189" dur="5.7">testimony of his own unbelief and his</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="4.599">trying to get people healed and his you</text>
  <text start="526.889" dur="4.62">know failure but then the Lord saying</text>
  <text start="529.019" dur="4.351">look John this is not rocket science you</text>
  <text start="531.509" dur="4.711">need to really just trust that I will</text>
  <text start="533.37" dur="4.589">heal people and the like most of us he</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="3.9">had to have his mind renewed to the</text>
  <text start="537.959" dur="4.55">truth but once he finally got it he got</text>
  <text start="540.12" dur="4.74">it you know the interesting thing is</text>
  <text start="542.509" dur="4.591">everybody who is really operating</text>
  <text start="544.86" dur="5.55">healing today almost everybody in</text>
  <text start="547.1" dur="5.109">America for sure kind of has their roots</text>
  <text start="550.41" dur="5.669">in what John Wimber did</text>
  <text start="552.209" dur="4.86">I mean Bethel and most of the churches</text>
  <text start="556.079" dur="3.391">that are teaching on the supernatural</text>
  <text start="557.069" dur="4.08">most of them go back to people who were</text>
  <text start="559.47" dur="3.899">discipled by Weber many of the leaders</text>
  <text start="561.149" dur="4.321">had been infected impacted by that very</text>
  <text start="563.369" dur="4.89">conference and ones that were near that</text>
  <text start="565.47" dur="4.95">yeah so it&amp;#39;s cool I love it I love</text>
  <text start="568.259" dur="5.341">healing and I love what God is doing</text>
  <text start="570.42" dur="5.759">with supernatural healing in in our</text>
  <text start="573.6" dur="4.979">generation and I think that we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="576.179" dur="3.541">see a lot more healing in the days to</text>
  <text start="578.579" dur="2.94">come we&amp;#39;re gonna see people healed of</text>
  <text start="579.72" dur="3.479">things that have not been healed I get a</text>
  <text start="581.519" dur="3.63">lot of requests for different conditions</text>
  <text start="583.199" dur="3.93">and some really there aren&amp;#39;t many</text>
  <text start="585.149" dur="4.651">testimonies but I believe we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="587.129" dur="5.851">start seeing those testimonies coming as</text>
  <text start="589.8" dur="5.699">we continue to step out in faith and</text>
  <text start="592.98" dur="7.469">believe God for greater things</text>
  <text start="595.499" dur="8.01">now Tom after you were healed of MS the</text>
  <text start="600.449" dur="5.88">Lord gave you a vision to explain the</text>
  <text start="603.509" dur="4.531">process in the dynamic of what was going</text>
  <text start="606.329" dur="3.18">on during your healing can you talk a</text>
  <text start="608.04" dur="2.7">little bit about that well when I was</text>
  <text start="609.509" dur="3.06">jumping up and down the guys are saying</text>
  <text start="610.74" dur="3.389">hey you know you shouldn&amp;#39;t do that I</text>
  <text start="612.569" dur="1.89">said I&amp;#39;ve been healed they said no you</text>
  <text start="614.129" dur="3.39">haven&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="614.459" dur="4.62">I said yes I haven&amp;#39;t so we decided this</text>
  <text start="617.519" dur="3.75">was for real then we needed to pause and</text>
  <text start="619.079" dur="3.57">thank the Lord so we we stood in a</text>
  <text start="621.269" dur="3.391">circle and we were thanking the Lord and</text>
  <text start="622.649" dur="4.92">as we did I had a vision and in it I saw</text>
  <text start="624.66" dur="4.739">a dam and in the dam there were drops of</text>
  <text start="627.569" dur="4.23">water that were filling like this lake</text>
  <text start="629.399" dur="4.29">behind the dam and he said Tom these</text>
  <text start="631.799" dur="3.96">drops of water represent the prayers of</text>
  <text start="633.689" dur="4.44">the saints everyone who&amp;#39;s prayed for you</text>
  <text start="635.759" dur="4.83">over the last seven years every one of</text>
  <text start="638.129" dur="6.18">their prayers counted for your miracle</text>
  <text start="640.589" dur="5.43">and then the dam erupted today and she</text>
  <text start="644.309" dur="3.301">said go back and thank everybody who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="646.019" dur="2.971">ever prayed for you and as you run</text>
  <text start="647.61" dur="5">across them thank them because they were</text>
  <text start="648.99" dur="6.539">a part of your miracle today and that is</text>
  <text start="652.61" dur="5.889">something that we probably don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="655.529" dur="4.65">enough appreciation for sometimes when</text>
  <text start="658.499" dur="3.57">it comes to you know the dynamics of</text>
  <text start="660.179" dur="4.14">healing because sometimes people get</text>
  <text start="662.069" dur="4.38">healed boom it&amp;#39;s a one time thing one</text>
  <text start="664.319" dur="4.291">prayer and you get healed and other</text>
  <text start="666.449" dur="3.87">times you need hundreds of people</text>
  <text start="668.61" dur="4.169">praying for you over years and years</text>
  <text start="670.319" dur="4.32">before that dam finally breaks and you</text>
  <text start="672.779" dur="4.02">get healed well and I realized in that</text>
  <text start="674.639" dur="4.14">instant that you and I are made in the</text>
  <text start="676.799" dur="3.571">image of God and that God said let there</text>
  <text start="678.779" dur="4.77">be light and there still stars being</text>
  <text start="680.37" dur="4.71">formed so when we pray when we pray that</text>
  <text start="683.549" dur="4.661">is still being activated</text>
  <text start="685.08" dur="5.26">right even though it may be days months</text>
  <text start="688.21" dur="4.95">years later it&amp;#39;s still being activated</text>
  <text start="690.34" dur="5.82">by the Lord right so before the break we</text>
  <text start="693.16" dur="4.83">were talking about the John Wimber signs</text>
  <text start="696.16" dur="3.36">and wonders conference in the eighties</text>
  <text start="697.99" dur="4.35">now you did not get to go to that</text>
  <text start="699.52" dur="4.41">conference I was the janitor so I had to</text>
  <text start="702.34" dur="3.33">stay back and clean the toilets while</text>
  <text start="703.93" dur="4.7">all the staff got to go they got to go</text>
  <text start="705.67" dur="5.55">have fun and you got to stay home but</text>
  <text start="708.63" dur="4.69">when they came back you got to witness</text>
  <text start="711.22" dur="4.35">your first healing yes so how did that</text>
  <text start="713.32" dur="3.45">happen well and and of course I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="715.57" dur="3.6">at the conference so I hadn&amp;#39;t heard</text>
  <text start="716.77" dur="4.35">anything of what had been taught and so</text>
  <text start="719.17" dur="3.51">my cousin who was the worship leader for</text>
  <text start="721.12" dur="3.03">the church and we were like twin</text>
  <text start="722.68" dur="5.94">brothers at different mothers very close</text>
  <text start="724.15" dur="6.9">and just he was Alton we joked together</text>
  <text start="728.62" dur="4.02">had a good time he had a cold and it</text>
  <text start="731.05" dur="2.7">came out of nowhere and he&amp;#39;s feeling</text>
  <text start="732.64" dur="2.28">sick he&amp;#39;d been trying to work all</text>
  <text start="733.75" dur="3.12">morning and it&amp;#39;s getting to be the</text>
  <text start="734.92" dur="4.41">afternoon and he&amp;#39;s gone Agatha cold in</text>
  <text start="736.87" dur="4.08">my nose I can feel good and so he was</text>
  <text start="739.33" dur="4.14">he&amp;#39;s and then he looked at me and he</text>
  <text start="740.95" dur="6.45">says wait a minute you could pray for me</text>
  <text start="743.47" dur="5.79">and I said what he said you can do it</text>
  <text start="747.4" dur="4.53">you can do what what I&amp;#39;ve learned and I</text>
  <text start="749.26" dur="4.89">said well I wasn&amp;#39;t at the conference he</text>
  <text start="751.93" dur="4.35">says all you got to do is be quiet and</text>
  <text start="754.15" dur="2.97">asked the Lord what he would have you do</text>
  <text start="756.28" dur="3.42">to pray for me</text>
  <text start="757.12" dur="5.94">just ask him to show you so I said okay</text>
  <text start="759.7" dur="4.68">and so I said no King Lord I just love</text>
  <text start="763.06" dur="3.75">my brother I ask that you bless him and</text>
  <text start="764.38" dur="6.09">I pray you&amp;#39;d show me how to pray and in</text>
  <text start="766.81" dur="5.55">my mind&amp;#39;s eye I saw me take my my index</text>
  <text start="770.47" dur="5.55">fingers and point them up to his temples</text>
  <text start="772.36" dur="6.09">and and just touch him and so I I said</text>
  <text start="776.02" dur="4.65">Lord be healed in the name of Jesus and</text>
  <text start="778.45" dur="8.91">I just touched him there and he looks at</text>
  <text start="780.67" dur="9.87">me he goes oh I think I&amp;#39;m better I said</text>
  <text start="787.36" dur="4.77">no it can&amp;#39;t happen that fast he says no</text>
  <text start="790.54" dur="3.63">no I feel good I feel good the headaches</text>
  <text start="792.13" dur="4.709">gone he says all the congestion is gone</text>
  <text start="794.17" dur="4.38">oh no I feel better I think I&amp;#39;m go back</text>
  <text start="796.839" dur="3.931">to work I said no way you&amp;#39;re gonna go</text>
  <text start="798.55" dur="3.75">home cuz you&amp;#39;re sick he said no I feel</text>
  <text start="800.77" dur="3.78">better and and that was the first</text>
  <text start="802.3" dur="3.72">healing ever saw and I had a hard time</text>
  <text start="804.55" dur="3.99">believing it myself it was so wonderful</text>
  <text start="806.02" dur="4.14">that I had the same unbelief myself the</text>
  <text start="808.54" dur="3">first time I feel couple of times I saw</text>
  <text start="810.16" dur="3.75">people healed I was like wait a minute</text>
  <text start="811.54" dur="4.86">wait a minute are you absolutely sure</text>
  <text start="813.91" dur="4.41">because I am having a hard time well I</text>
  <text start="816.4" dur="2.55">think that you&amp;#39;re really ill it got</text>
  <text start="818.32" dur="3.33">actually heals</text>
  <text start="818.95" dur="4.26">they threw me but when it happens it</text>
  <text start="821.65" dur="3.39">happens that it is really unbelievable</text>
  <text start="823.21" dur="4.01">sometimes well then it&amp;#39;s nothing that we</text>
  <text start="825.04" dur="5.01">make happen is all of the Lord and so</text>
  <text start="827.22" dur="4.42">we&amp;#39;re like we&amp;#39;re like a witness and</text>
  <text start="830.05" dur="3.09">eyewitness of what&amp;#39;s going on and even</text>
  <text start="831.64" dur="3.27">though we may have said the prayer he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="833.14" dur="3.69">the one who&amp;#39;s making it happen but you</text>
  <text start="834.91" dur="4.62">know you kind of touched on something</text>
  <text start="836.83" dur="4.92">and I think a lot of us need to consider</text>
  <text start="839.53" dur="6.12">when we&amp;#39;re praying for people and that</text>
  <text start="841.75" dur="6.78">is that Wimber was big on following a</text>
  <text start="845.65" dur="5.37">leading of the Holy Spirit letting his</text>
  <text start="848.53" dur="3.75">letting his presence come and following</text>
  <text start="851.02" dur="2.58">the leading of the Holy Spirit that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="852.28" dur="4.56">something that some of us have got kind</text>
  <text start="853.6" dur="5.67">of gotten away from and I think I think</text>
  <text start="856.84" dur="4.26">a lot of the reasons why sometimes</text>
  <text start="859.27" dur="5.16">people aren&amp;#39;t healed is because we are</text>
  <text start="861.1" dur="4.98">not actually asking the Lord to show us</text>
  <text start="864.43" dur="3.33">specifically what needs to be done</text>
  <text start="866.08" dur="4.29">mm-hmm I think there&amp;#39;s a hand-in-hand</text>
  <text start="867.76" dur="4.65">with authority and anointing right of</text>
  <text start="870.37" dur="3.6">standing in God&amp;#39;s authority of what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="872.41" dur="3.75">given us as children of God to be able</text>
  <text start="873.97" dur="4.14">to pray in to make happen into this</text>
  <text start="876.16" dur="4.14">world because of who we are in Christ</text>
  <text start="878.11" dur="4.23">but there&amp;#39;s also an anointing of his</text>
  <text start="880.3" dur="3.81">presence to be aware of to watch for</text>
  <text start="882.34" dur="3.33">like me with my healing feeling all</text>
  <text start="884.11" dur="3.93">those symptoms or things that were going</text>
  <text start="885.67" dur="3.96">on in my body and recognizing something</text>
  <text start="888.04" dur="3.66">special is happening and when I pray for</text>
  <text start="889.63" dur="4.05">people I often ask them what they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="891.7" dur="3.45">feeling or what they&amp;#39;re sensing and some</text>
  <text start="893.68" dur="2.94">people at you know they asked me like</text>
  <text start="895.15" dur="2.73">okay why are you asking those questions</text>
  <text start="896.62" dur="3.03">why are you asking you know what are you</text>
  <text start="897.88" dur="4.2">sensing what are you feeling because I I</text>
  <text start="899.65" dur="3.51">want to know what the Holy Spirit is</text>
  <text start="902.08" dur="4.17">doing with them</text>
  <text start="903.16" dur="5.34">do they feel heat in their back do they</text>
  <text start="906.25" dur="3.57">feel tingling on their skin do they feel</text>
  <text start="908.5" dur="4.02">something going on are they seeing</text>
  <text start="909.82" dur="5.01">something because that tells me what the</text>
  <text start="912.52" dur="5.31">Holy Spirit is doing and that way I can</text>
  <text start="914.83" dur="5.07">sort of work with him if I know what</text>
  <text start="917.83" dur="3.75">he&amp;#39;s doing and sometimes I see it but</text>
  <text start="919.9" dur="3.06">sometimes I don&amp;#39;t well and that&amp;#39;s John</text>
  <text start="921.58" dur="3">Wimber said to pray with your eyes open</text>
  <text start="922.96" dur="3.24">because sometimes they may actually be</text>
  <text start="924.58" dur="3.24">trembling or right you know showing</text>
  <text start="926.2" dur="3.09">signs of the Holy Spirit being on them</text>
  <text start="927.82" dur="4.47">and they don&amp;#39;t feel a thing I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="929.29" dur="4.38">videos old videos of wimbur or he was at</text>
  <text start="932.29" dur="3.57">one of the conferences and he would tell</text>
  <text start="933.67" dur="3.93">people look look at their skin look at</text>
  <text start="935.86" dur="3.24">how their skin is rippling look at this</text>
  <text start="937.6" dur="4.59">observe this look at how their eyes are</text>
  <text start="939.1" dur="6.81">fluttering and he would point out to the</text>
  <text start="942.19" dur="5.37">students how they could see the way that</text>
  <text start="945.91" dur="3.93">the Holy Spirit was manifesting on</text>
  <text start="947.56" dur="4.379">people yes he was a very very keen</text>
  <text start="949.84" dur="4.199">observer yes and I think again</text>
  <text start="951.939" dur="3.75">I think we need to become observers and</text>
  <text start="954.039" dur="3.96">really pay attention with Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="955.689" dur="4.71">like the taking hands with God in the</text>
  <text start="957.999" dur="5.1">process of praying that brad wimmer</text>
  <text start="960.399" dur="4.89">allows with that to me it&amp;#39;s like tending</text>
  <text start="963.099" dur="5.67">the garden with God yeah of our lives</text>
  <text start="965.289" dur="5.55">yeah it is exactly like that so can you</text>
  <text start="968.769" dur="5.04">tell me one of your favorite healing</text>
  <text start="970.839" dur="5.67">testimonies of all time you have a lot</text>
  <text start="973.809" dur="5.37">of them one of my favorites was actually</text>
  <text start="976.509" dur="6">back in that time my cousin had had</text>
  <text start="979.179" dur="4.56">daughter amber 10 months old was just</text>
  <text start="982.509" dur="3.48">starting to learn how to walk she was in</text>
  <text start="983.739" dur="3.99">one of those metal walkers with the</text>
  <text start="985.989" dur="2.88">wheels on the bottom and she&amp;#39;d bounce up</text>
  <text start="987.729" dur="5.07">and down and the thing would move around</text>
  <text start="988.869" dur="6.99">and and so I was at the church and I was</text>
  <text start="992.799" dur="4.44">mopping the floors on a Saturday and in</text>
  <text start="995.859" dur="2.85">comes the administrator for the church</text>

  <text start="998.709" dur="7.02">news Tom and I at that moment what had</text>
  <text start="1003.209" dur="5.37">happened was baby amber was outside in</text>
  <text start="1005.729" dur="4.92">the back yard of the house and was being</text>
  <text start="1008.579" dur="4.35">watched by a one of the teenagers and</text>
  <text start="1010.649" dur="3.69">the teenager fell asleep and baby amber</text>
  <text start="1012.929" dur="2.7">was bouncing up and down in her little</text>
  <text start="1014.339" dur="3.42">Walker and it went to the deep end of</text>
  <text start="1015.629" dur="3.091">the pool took her right to the bottom</text>
  <text start="1017.759" dur="3.93">Wow</text>
  <text start="1018.72" dur="5.52">code blue at least 15 minutes at least</text>
  <text start="1021.689" dur="5.671">15 minutes okay so she comes out of the</text>
  <text start="1024.24" dur="4.889">pool limp and not breathing right right</text>

  <text start="1039.269" dur="3.93">so they took hands and they paused and</text>
  <text start="1041.49" dur="4.019">they said Lord we commit amber into your</text>
  <text start="1043.199" dur="3.6">hands and then they put on the air vac</text>
  <text start="1045.509" dur="3.63">and they said we&amp;#39;ll meet you at Good Sam</text>

  <text start="1056.46" dur="4.98">on the linoleum and start scrubbing and</text>
  <text start="1059.25" dur="3.539">so she left me there and when she did I</text>
  <text start="1061.44" dur="3.63">fell to my knees because it was the</text>

  <text start="1065.07" dur="4.439">was just like Lord no not amber amber</text>

  <text start="1069.509" dur="3.721">crying and I&amp;#39;m weeping it feels like a</text>
  <text start="1071.58" dur="4.949">good 20 minutes or so and you get to the</text>
  <text start="1073.23" dur="5.64">end of the cry and I took a breath and</text>
  <text start="1076.529" dur="4.171">that still small voice of God speaks to</text>
  <text start="1078.87" dur="3.7">my heart and says she&amp;#39;s gonna come out</text>

  <text start="1242.71" dur="3.78">said we found out that her brain is</text>
  <text start="1244.21" dur="4.44">going to swell and if her brain swells</text>

  <text start="1400.42" dur="4.53">testimony I love it</text>
  <text start="1402.22" dur="5.58">it&amp;#39;s easy to underestimate the power of</text>
  <text start="1404.95" dur="5.16">the testimony but you know when people</text>
  <text start="1407.8" dur="4.23">witness the miraculous especially people</text>

  <text start="1412.03" dur="5.04">doctors they know people don&amp;#39;t survive</text>
  <text start="1414.31" dur="4.71">stuff like that unless it&amp;#39;s the power of</text>
  <text start="1417.07" dur="3.96">God that does something and when the</text>
  <text start="1419.02" dur="4.49">power of God shows up and does a miracle</text>
  <text start="1421.03" dur="5.37">like that it is incredibly powerful</text>
  <text start="1423.51" dur="5.17">I&amp;#39;ve heard of testimonies of entire</text>
  <text start="1426.4" dur="4.41">families given their lives to Jesus when</text>
  <text start="1428.68" dur="3.81">one person got healed I saw a church</text>
  <text start="1430.81" dur="4.32">that got impacted by that there was a</text>
  <text start="1432.49" dur="4.47">lady who&amp;#39;d come from California was that</text>
  <text start="1435.13" dur="4.11">Mayo Clinic she had been diagnosed with</text>
  <text start="1436.96" dur="4.71">cancer was full of cancer they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1439.24" dur="4.44">expect her to even survive the biopsy</text>
  <text start="1441.67" dur="3.36">and so as Wednesday she was gonna do the</text>
  <text start="1443.68" dur="2.79">biopsy on Monday and so they told her</text>
  <text start="1445.03" dur="2.76">it&amp;#39;s a man we don&amp;#39;t expect you to even</text>
  <text start="1446.47" dur="2.94">survive this and she was there with her</text>

  <text start="1456.01" dur="3">are we gonna do and she says well I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1457.03" dur="3.27">not ready to die her and they came from</text>
  <text start="1459.01" dur="3">a church that didn&amp;#39;t believe that God</text>
  <text start="1460.3" dur="2.85">heals today they know that was all back</text>
  <text start="1462.01" dur="3.63">in the Bible when it needed to be</text>
  <text start="1463.15" dur="4.29">written and writin happened today and so</text>
  <text start="1465.64" dur="3.39">she said I&amp;#39;m just I gotta find somebody</text>
  <text start="1467.44" dur="3.33">who believes in healing so they began to</text>
  <text start="1469.03" dur="3.6">drive up and down the street saying God</text>
  <text start="1470.77" dur="4.17">show us which way to go which was a big</text>
  <text start="1472.63" dur="4.38">step for them and God directed them to</text>
  <text start="1474.94" dur="4.02">our church and when I had gone to church</text>

  <text start="1803.11" dur="5.309">is the one teaching that you get rid of</text>
  <text start="1805.529" dur="5.49">there&amp;#39;s a phrase that people use all the</text>
  <text start="1808.419" dur="6.39">time about well it must be God&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="1811.019" dur="6.731">that must have been God&amp;#39;s will and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1814.809" dur="4.801">like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s this wonderful out that</text>
  <text start="1817.75" dur="5.37">we&amp;#39;ve given for the things that have</text>
  <text start="1819.61" dur="4.769">happened that we can&amp;#39;t explain or that</text>
  <text start="1823.12" dur="2.759">we don&amp;#39;t like to have happen we said</text>

  <text start="1825.879" dur="4.231">sick because we a lot of people think</text>
  <text start="1828.429" dur="5.25">God&amp;#39;s in control of everything right</text>
  <text start="1830.11" dur="5.039">right so from that place then we we then</text>
  <text start="1833.679" dur="3.24">like with me with the MS one of the</text>
  <text start="1835.149" dur="4.38">things I had to work through was is God</text>
  <text start="1836.919" dur="3.72">angry with me is he upset with me is he</text>
  <text start="1839.529" dur="2.4">letting this happen because he&amp;#39;s trying</text>
  <text start="1840.639" dur="4.321">to eat less punished</text>
  <text start="1841.929" dur="4.321">are you teaching a lesson right so it</text>
  <text start="1844.96" dur="2.76">must be God&amp;#39;s will because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1846.25" dur="5.159">happening it&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s will to have this</text>
  <text start="1847.72" dur="5.52">happen to me and that question it must</text>
  <text start="1851.409" dur="4.11">be God&amp;#39;s will or if it&amp;#39;s the will of God</text>
  <text start="1853.24" dur="3.45">or or after the person said well it must</text>
  <text start="1855.519" dur="4.051">have been God&amp;#39;s will for them to go to</text>
  <text start="1856.69" dur="4.65">heaven I think is such an easy out for</text>
  <text start="1859.57" dur="3.329">us I think God wants are those of us</text>
  <text start="1861.34" dur="3.66">especially those of us who aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1862.899" dur="4.02">suffering but we know people who are I</text>
  <text start="1865" dur="4.049">believe God wants us to be more in a</text>
  <text start="1866.919" dur="3.6">state of intercession more in a state of</text>
  <text start="1869.049" dur="3.33">his heart of love towards the people</text>
  <text start="1870.519" dur="3.63">who&amp;#39;s suffering because I think it&amp;#39;s up</text>
  <text start="1872.379" dur="3.601">to us to get the answer not the person</text>
  <text start="1874.149" dur="3.48">who&amp;#39;s suffering I believe God wants us</text>
  <text start="1875.98" dur="3.93">to be more involved instead of giving in</text>
  <text start="1877.629" dur="3.421">to while if it&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="1879.91" dur="2.64">that&amp;#39;s just the way it&amp;#39;s gonna happen</text>
  <text start="1881.05" dur="3.66">and there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do from look</text>
  <text start="1882.55" dur="3.54">they did those things and so now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1884.71" dur="2.82">paying the price for it because it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1886.09" dur="2.91">God&amp;#39;s will for them to suffer and</text>
  <text start="1887.53" dur="3.06">there&amp;#39;s nothing we can do and they stop</text>
  <text start="1889" dur="3.6">praying they stop being involved in the</text>
  <text start="1890.59" dur="4.11">process of inviting God in to be an</text>
  <text start="1892.6" dur="5.97">answer we kind of become like job&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1894.7" dur="6.08">counselors yes yes precisely</text>
  <text start="1898.57" dur="5.04">you&amp;#39;ve done something to deserve this</text>
  <text start="1900.78" dur="4.48">you know if you would have done that you</text>
  <text start="1903.61" dur="4.2">wouldn&amp;#39;t be having this situation you</text>
  <text start="1905.26" dur="6.69">know it&amp;#39;s God&amp;#39;s will yeah I agree with</text>
  <text start="1907.81" dur="6.75">you that whole idea really just bugs me</text>
  <text start="1911.95" dur="4.68">terribly and I think we need to develop</text>
  <text start="1914.56" dur="4.02">a better understanding of God and we</text>
  <text start="1916.63" dur="3.42">need to understand that suffering and</text>
  <text start="1918.58" dur="3.45">sickness and disease is not God&amp;#39;s will</text>
  <text start="1920.05" dur="4.77">Jesus didn&amp;#39;t tolerate any of that stuff</text>
  <text start="1922.03" dur="5.94">and he saw people that were sick blind</text>
  <text start="1924.82" dur="5.31">lame you healed him he didn&amp;#39;t say well</text>
  <text start="1927.97" dur="3.18">you know it&amp;#39;s the Father&amp;#39;s will for you</text>
  <text start="1930.13" dur="4.49">to suffer and be blind</text>
  <text start="1931.15" dur="6.36">no he healed them yeah their vision back</text>
  <text start="1934.62" dur="5.14">so that was one of the things when I had</text>
  <text start="1937.51" dur="4.35">the MS that was that was important for</text>
  <text start="1939.76" dur="4.2">me was I realized God is not angry with</text>
  <text start="1941.86" dur="4.32">me he loves me he died on the cross to</text>
  <text start="1943.96" dur="4.98">set me free from this so then I realized</text>
  <text start="1946.18" dur="4.29">I&amp;#39;m to draw near to a God of love and to</text>
  <text start="1948.94" dur="3.96">his heart and the closer I can get to</text>
  <text start="1950.47" dur="4.29">his heart the more comfort I felt so I</text>
  <text start="1952.9" dur="4.2">felt like if I&amp;#39;m at least gonna walk</text>
  <text start="1954.76" dur="3.54">through this with God a loving God then</text>
  <text start="1957.1" dur="2.73">to believe that he&amp;#39;s got something</text>
  <text start="1958.3" dur="2.52">unless he wants to show me what my sin</text>
  <text start="1959.83" dur="4.35">is then I&amp;#39;ll be more than happy to</text>
  <text start="1960.82" dur="6.42">confess it and you went through a lot of</text>
  <text start="1964.18" dur="5.22">emotional changes emotional healing some</text>
  <text start="1967.24" dur="4.77">identity shifting during that time</text>
  <text start="1969.4" dur="5.58">absolutely I mean you know he dealt me</text>
  <text start="1972.01" dur="4.86">about taking the whole diagnosis and how</text>
  <text start="1974.98" dur="3.99">it became my identity I have a mess and</text>
  <text start="1976.87" dur="3.72">he said no you&amp;#39;re my child you&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="1978.97" dur="3.78">child of God who has been attacked like</text>
  <text start="1980.59" dur="4.11">a warship that&amp;#39;s been hit with a mine</text>
  <text start="1982.75" dur="3.33">you&amp;#39;ve been hit from the outside with</text>
  <text start="1984.7" dur="3.18">something but you are my child and I</text>
  <text start="1986.08" dur="3.69">love you I think that&amp;#39;s one of the the</text>
  <text start="1987.88" dur="4.53">most difficult things that I see</text>
  <text start="1989.77" dur="6.21">personally is when I run into people who</text>
  <text start="1992.41" dur="5.58">say I am a diabetic the diabetes the</text>
  <text start="1995.98" dur="3.99">disease becomes their identity yes they</text>
  <text start="1997.99" dur="3.51">really start to believe I am a diabetic</text>
  <text start="1999.97" dur="3.21">that&amp;#39;s who I am that&amp;#39;s what I am and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2001.5" dur="5.07">always gonna be a diabetic or I&amp;#39;m always</text>
  <text start="2003.18" dur="6.21">gonna have MS or I am bipolar no you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2006.57" dur="6.71">not bipolar you are a child of God who</text>
  <text start="2009.39" dur="6.92">has really bad mood swings and yes and</text>
  <text start="2013.28" dur="6.32">you need some emotional healing and when</text>
  <text start="2016.31" dur="5.76">we start to get our identity right and</text>
  <text start="2019.6" dur="6.07">stop identifying ourself with our</text>
  <text start="2022.07" dur="6.14">condition that really frees up God and</text>
  <text start="2025.67" dur="5.48">it gives him an ability to work with us</text>
  <text start="2028.21" dur="5.02">to get us free of the other stuff yes</text>
  <text start="2031.15" dur="3.49">absolutely because then we&amp;#39;re inviting</text>
  <text start="2033.23" dur="2.91">him to be a part of the process for our</text>
  <text start="2034.64" dur="3.03">healing we don&amp;#39;t feel like he&amp;#39;s against</text>
  <text start="2036.14" dur="3.15">me he&amp;#39;s actually for me which is what</text>
  <text start="2037.67" dur="3.69">scripture tells us he&amp;#39;s for us and not</text>
  <text start="2039.29" dur="3.54">against us he is for us and you know</text>
  <text start="2041.36" dur="5.19">Jesus said as a man thinks in his heart</text>
  <text start="2042.83" dur="6.21">so he is and if you are convinced in</text>
  <text start="2046.55" dur="5.28">your heart that you are schizophrenic</text>
  <text start="2049.04" dur="4.92">and that&amp;#39;s just how God made you or that</text>
  <text start="2051.83" dur="4.38">you are whatever and that&amp;#39;s how God made</text>
  <text start="2053.96" dur="4.53">you if that becomes your identity it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2056.21" dur="3.87">really really difficult to change that</text>
  <text start="2058.49" dur="4.11">because you&amp;#39;ve taken it on as your</text>
  <text start="2060.08" dur="3.93">identity and God is not going to make</text>
  <text start="2062.6" dur="3.69">you something that you don&amp;#39;t believe you</text>
  <text start="2064.01" dur="4.14">are right you kind of put yourself</text>
  <text start="2066.29" dur="3.24">within the cell of it if you will like a</text>
  <text start="2068.15" dur="3.36">prison cell and said this is the way I</text>
  <text start="2069.53" dur="3.57">am and so he&amp;#39;s always gonna be yeah I</text>
  <text start="2071.51" dur="3.27">had a dream speaking of prison cells I</text>
  <text start="2073.1" dur="5.52">had a dream years ago where the Lord</text>
  <text start="2074.78" dur="7.5">showed me that he had authorized people</text>
  <text start="2078.62" dur="5.309">to be free of their prisons and I was</text>
  <text start="2082.28" dur="3.6">part of a team that went around and set</text>
  <text start="2083.929" dur="5.461">people free and open up gates of Prisons</text>
  <text start="2085.88" dur="4.86">however there was we came to this one</text>
  <text start="2089.39" dur="4.68">area where there are people in prison</text>
  <text start="2090.74" dur="5.55">and they had decided they had voted not</text>
  <text start="2094.07" dur="5.34">to get out of prison they wanted to stay</text>
  <text start="2096.29" dur="5.49">in prison so God said with that</text>
  <text start="2099.41" dur="3.78">particular prison you have no power over</text>
  <text start="2101.78" dur="4.2">that prison because they have decided</text>
  <text start="2103.19" dur="4.62">they want to remain inmates you can go</text>
  <text start="2105.98" dur="3.48">and you can free anybody who has decided</text>
  <text start="2107.81" dur="3.15">they want to be free but for anybody</text>
  <text start="2109.46" dur="3.18">who&amp;#39;s decided they want to remain an</text>
  <text start="2110.96" dur="4.29">inmate you have no power over them they</text>
  <text start="2112.64" dur="4.11">have already decided their own fate even</text>
  <text start="2115.25" dur="3.9">though God&amp;#39;s Will was for them to be</text>
  <text start="2116.75" dur="6.42">free and I could have freed them they</text>
  <text start="2119.15" dur="8.22">have chosen not to be free and we have</text>
  <text start="2123.17" dur="6.6">to choose freedom we have to choose to</text>
  <text start="2127.37" dur="4.17">cooperate and work with God so that we</text>
  <text start="2129.77" dur="3.33">can be free I mean that&amp;#39;s a big part of</text>
  <text start="2131.54" dur="3.36">the process I think it&amp;#39;s it indeed</text>
  <text start="2133.1" dur="3.6">shifts you have to shift and say God is</text>
  <text start="2134.9" dur="3.69">a God of love and kindness and he&amp;#39;s for</text>
  <text start="2136.7" dur="3.9">me he died on the cross to free me from</text>
  <text start="2138.59" dur="4.02">this he did all that he could to be here</text>
  <text start="2140.6" dur="4.05">for me so to actually say that it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2142.61" dur="4.18">God&amp;#39;s will for me to have this so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2144.65" dur="3.64">meant to suffer we&amp;#39;re giving in to</text>
  <text start="2146.79" dur="3.93">from the enemy it is the life in the</text>
  <text start="2148.29" dur="4.77">enemy and a lot of what&amp;#39;s wrong with us</text>
  <text start="2150.72" dur="6.24">today is that we&amp;#39;re believing lies about</text>
  <text start="2153.06" dur="7.2">ourselves about God so Tom tell me about</text>
  <text start="2156.96" dur="6.81">God&amp;#39;s living room God&amp;#39;s living room is</text>
  <text start="2160.26" dur="6.54">located on Cave Creek Road and just</text>
  <text start="2163.77" dur="4.58">south of Greenway we&amp;#39;ve actually the the</text>
  <text start="2166.8" dur="3.78">heart of the places we&amp;#39;re kind of like a</text>
  <text start="2168.35" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s like a retreat center in the middle</text>
