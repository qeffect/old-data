  <text start="42.629" dur="8.461">sorry I&amp;#39;m at work this is what I do for</text>
  <text start="47.46" dur="5.07">a living it&amp;#39;s my job training and</text>
  <text start="51.09" dur="9.05">equipping the Saints for the work of</text>
  <text start="52.53" dur="11.72">ministry Ephesians 4:11 is what I do all</text>
  <text start="60.14" dur="9.07">right I want to get to the subject of</text>
  <text start="64.25" dur="8.11">today&amp;#39;s message which is spiritual</text>
  <text start="69.21" dur="6.15">warfare 101 this is going to be well I</text>
  <text start="72.36" dur="7.619">plan on making this a short message and</text>
  <text start="75.36" dur="8.16">I&amp;#39;m going to ask you to think carefully</text>
  <text start="79.979" dur="6.091">about everything I say before you quote</text>
  <text start="83.52" dur="5.389">me or misquote me before you take</text>
  <text start="86.07" dur="6.299">something I say out of context please</text>
  <text start="88.909" dur="5.801">think carefully about everything I say</text>
  <text start="92.369" dur="5.221">in this message because it is very easy</text>
  <text start="94.71" dur="6.42">to take things I say out of context and</text>
  <text start="97.59" dur="7.529">distort the meaning of it spiritual</text>
  <text start="101.13" dur="6.21">warfare is a very tricky thing and there</text>
  <text start="105.119" dur="6.03">is a lot of really bad teaching in the</text>
  <text start="107.34" dur="5.13">church about spiritual warfare and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="111.149" dur="5.671">going to use a couple of illustrations</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="9.679">about spiritual warfare so I get a lot</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="8.67">of prayer requests from people who are</text>
  <text start="122.149" dur="6.191">under spiritual attack they&amp;#39;re either</text>
  <text start="125.49" dur="5.37">feeling spiritual oppression they are</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="5.01">running into demons in their dreams they</text>
  <text start="130.86" dur="6.12">feel like all the doors are closed</text>
  <text start="133.35" dur="8.09">they feel like they&amp;#39;re just under some</text>
  <text start="136.98" dur="6.33">type of spiritual attack alright and</text>
  <text start="141.44" dur="6.82">that is actually a very common</text>
  <text start="143.31" dur="7.98">experience it is common to experience</text>
  <text start="148.26" dur="6.9">those things even more when you start</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="5.82">pursuing God and if you dare to step out</text>
  <text start="155.16" dur="6.18">into the supranational and start praying</text>
  <text start="157.11" dur="7.83">for people to be healed you&amp;#39;re going to</text>
  <text start="161.34" dur="8.88">experience more attacks all right now</text>
  <text start="164.94" dur="8.76">this is basic 101 if you start to think</text>
  <text start="170.22" dur="5.58">that you can set people free of demons</text>
  <text start="173.7" dur="4.97">and start doing deliverance and physical</text>
  <text start="175.8" dur="5.88">healing you are going to be attacked</text>
  <text start="178.67" dur="6.25">period you heard one</text>
  <text start="181.68" dur="4.38">trust me it happened to me it happens it</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="4.77">has happened to everybody that I know</text>
  <text start="186.06" dur="5.94">who dared to start walking in the</text>
  <text start="189.69" dur="5.28">authority that God has given us the</text>
  <text start="192" dur="7.26">attacks increased 10 and the attacks</text>
  <text start="194.97" dur="6.57">when you begin to take the battle to the</text>
  <text start="199.26" dur="6">kingdom of darkness the kingdom of</text>
  <text start="201.54" dur="6.51">darkness is going to push back they want</text>
  <text start="205.26" dur="5.73">to scare you the the enemy wants to</text>
  <text start="208.05" dur="5.16">frighten intimidate and scare you into</text>
  <text start="210.99" dur="4.02">thinking you know if I go back to just</text>
  <text start="213.21" dur="3.27">my quiet little life and I don&amp;#39;t try to</text>
  <text start="215.01" dur="3.12">get people healed and I&amp;#39;m not like</text>
  <text start="216.48" dur="3.12">involved in deliverance or anything like</text>
  <text start="218.13" dur="4.32">that</text>
  <text start="219.6" dur="8.19">maybe these attacks will quit all right</text>
  <text start="222.45" dur="7.98">I&amp;#39;m going just letting you know if you</text>
  <text start="227.79" dur="4.56">dare to operate in the authority that</text>
  <text start="230.43" dur="4.62">God has given you if you dare to</text>
  <text start="232.35" dur="4.29">exercise power and get people healed you</text>
  <text start="235.05" dur="2.88">are going to suffer attacks you&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="236.64" dur="5.79">experienced attacks it&amp;#39;ll get an</text>
  <text start="237.93" dur="7.38">increase for a while and what God wants</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="6.9">you to do is he wants you to realize</text>
  <text start="245.31" dur="6.06">you&amp;#39;re an overcomer why would God call</text>
  <text start="249.33" dur="7.76">us overcomers if we have nothing to</text>
  <text start="251.37" dur="8.36">overcome we have to overcome the enemy</text>
  <text start="257.09" dur="5.24">blood of the Lamb word of our testimony</text>
  <text start="259.73" dur="4.52">love not their lives to the death</text>
  <text start="262.33" dur="3.209">right if you&amp;#39;re an overcomer you have to</text>
  <text start="264.25" dur="3.419">have something to overcome and the</text>
  <text start="265.539" dur="4.38">kingdom of darkness is always trying to</text>
  <text start="267.669" dur="3.9">get in our faces trying to get us to</text>
  <text start="269.919" dur="6.99">back down to stop doing what we&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="271.569" dur="10.771">called to do so just realize there there</text>
  <text start="276.909" dur="7.5">is an enemy the enemy is real and we God</text>
  <text start="282.34" dur="5.52">is trying to train and equip us to</text>
  <text start="284.409" dur="10.081">become overcomers to live as overcomers</text>
  <text start="287.86" dur="9.779">and that means fighting the good fight</text>
  <text start="294.49" dur="6">and doing battle now I received a</text>
  <text start="297.639" dur="4.68">message from someone this morning on</text>
  <text start="300.49" dur="5.79">Twitter I received a lot of these</text>
  <text start="302.319" dur="7.021">messages and this person asked me to</text>
  <text start="306.28" dur="5.759">pray for them too that God would protect</text>
  <text start="309.34" dur="9.41">them from the enemy from attacks of the</text>
  <text start="312.039" dur="10.56">enemy no it is it is a it&amp;#39;s a normal</text>
  <text start="318.75" dur="7.029">request to ask God to protect you from</text>
  <text start="322.599" dur="5.481">the attacks of the enemy the Bible says</text>
  <text start="325.779" dur="5.7">the name of the Lord is a strong tower</text>
  <text start="328.08" dur="4.6">he who goes into him will be kept safe</text>
  <text start="331.479" dur="3.06">all right</text>
  <text start="332.68" dur="4.47">and there&amp;#39;s a lot of scripture passages</text>
  <text start="334.539" dur="5.1">that talk about how the Lord can protect</text>
  <text start="337.15" dur="6.66">us he puts a hedge around us he protects</text>
  <text start="339.639" dur="5.09">us from the enemy in certain ways Psalm</text>
  <text start="343.81" dur="5.34">91</text>
  <text start="344.729" dur="8.261">but Psalm 81 you have to realize applies</text>
  <text start="349.15" dur="6.15">to a specific type of person a lot of</text>
  <text start="352.99" dur="4.53">people just pray Psalm 91 over</text>
  <text start="355.3" dur="4.339">themselves thinking that if I pray</text>
  <text start="357.52" dur="5.63">someone be won over myself I&amp;#39;m covered</text>
  <text start="359.639" dur="11.321">well it doesn&amp;#39;t actually work that way</text>
  <text start="363.15" dur="13.06">Psalm 91 says he who makes his abode his</text>
  <text start="370.96" dur="8.4">shelter under the wings of God will be</text>
  <text start="376.21" dur="6.54">protected all right so if you want the</text>
  <text start="379.36" dur="8.609">promise of Psalm 91 you have to you have</text>
  <text start="382.75" dur="7.319">to live in the shelter under the Lord&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="387.969" dur="5.551">wings you have to live close enough to</text>
  <text start="390.069" dur="5.251">him and that he is able to protect you</text>
  <text start="393.52" dur="4.84">and a lot of people don&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="395.32" dur="5.65">it just breaks almighty one but they</text>
  <text start="398.36" dur="4.92">don&amp;#39;t live the lifestyle where they are</text>
  <text start="400.97" dur="8.25">actually under the shelter of God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="403.28" dur="7.88">wings it&amp;#39;s a choice and so to take it it</text>
  <text start="409.22" dur="4.08">requires you to live a certain way I</text>
  <text start="411.16" dur="3.52">didn&amp;#39;t want to you just put that I</text>
  <text start="413.3" dur="6.11">comment I didn&amp;#39;t wasn&amp;#39;t going to talk</text>
  <text start="414.68" dur="10.53">about that but it is true all right so</text>
  <text start="419.41" dur="8.35">let me give you an example if you were a</text>
  <text start="425.21" dur="6.21">teenager and you were skinny and you</text>
  <text start="427.76" dur="6.83">were kind of nerdy and you get picked on</text>
  <text start="431.42" dur="5.43">by kids in the neighborhood a lot and</text>
  <text start="434.59" dur="3.61">you&amp;#39;re getting beat up and you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="436.85" dur="2.28">getting picked on it happened to me a</text>
  <text start="438.2" dur="2.64">lot when I was a kid</text>
  <text start="439.13" dur="5.39">not because I was skinny it&amp;#39;s because I</text>
  <text start="440.84" dur="9.51">had older brothers it would be tempting</text>
  <text start="444.52" dur="8.8">to ask God to protect you from the</text>
  <text start="450.35" dur="6.48">attacks to protect you from being picked</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="6.63">on it would be tempting to ask God to</text>
  <text start="456.83" dur="6.96">stop these attacks from happening all</text>
  <text start="459.95" dur="7.74">right that&amp;#39;s one solution God make the</text>
  <text start="463.79" dur="7.14">attacks stop all right but there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="467.69" dur="7.05">another solution what if you go to the</text>
  <text start="470.93" dur="7.68">gym and start working out what if you</text>
  <text start="474.74" dur="8.16">grow in wisdom what if you go and learn</text>
  <text start="478.61" dur="6.12">martial arts what if you become a more</text>
  <text start="482.9" dur="3.36">loving and compassionate person what if</text>
  <text start="484.73" dur="3.99">you learn to operate the gifts of the</text>
  <text start="486.26" dur="4.11">Spirit and you start giving these people</text>
  <text start="488.72" dur="2.88">that are attacking you words of</text>
  <text start="490.37" dur="2.7">knowledge and praying for them to be</text>
  <text start="491.6" dur="3.78">healed or what if you just back them</text>
  <text start="493.07" dur="4.92">down because you went to the gym grew</text>
  <text start="495.38" dur="4.08">and became stronger and bigger and when</text>
  <text start="497.99" dur="2.88">they saw you coming down the street a</text>
  <text start="499.46" dur="3.209">year later they&amp;#39;re like yeah I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="500.87" dur="3.24">gonna mess with that person he&amp;#39;s got</text>
  <text start="502.669" dur="2.851">muscles he&amp;#39;s ripped he&amp;#39;s going to the</text>
  <text start="504.11" dur="6.57">gym we&amp;#39;ll find somebody else to pick on</text>
  <text start="505.52" dur="7.11">one solution is asking God to pratap the</text>
  <text start="510.68" dur="4.95">attacks the other solution is to</text>
  <text start="512.63" dur="8.25">strengthen yourself so that you can back</text>
  <text start="515.63" dur="8.7">down the attacker all right what does</text>
  <text start="520.88" dur="7.01">that mean spiritually that means if</text>
  <text start="524.33" dur="6.69">you&amp;#39;re being attacked by evil spirits</text>
  <text start="527.89" dur="4.81">fallen angels demons whatever and look</text>
  <text start="531.02" dur="4.8">if you&amp;#39;re being attacked on social media</text>
  <text start="532.7" dur="6.27">by people realize your your fight is not</text>
  <text start="535.82" dur="4.86">against them your fight is against the</text>
  <text start="538.97" dur="8.49">evil spirits that are controlling them</text>
  <text start="540.68" dur="9.99">right and a lot of us think that certain</text>
  <text start="547.46" dur="8.55">people have it in for us and they talk</text>
  <text start="550.67" dur="9.51">bad about us and they slander us and we</text>
  <text start="556.01" dur="7.2">think oh that person is an evil person</text>
  <text start="560.18" dur="4.56">well they may be in a sense but really</text>
  <text start="563.21" dur="4.86">most of those people are on earth spirit</text>
  <text start="564.74" dur="5.97">of control they&amp;#39;re being controlled by a</text>
  <text start="568.07" dur="5.43">spirit and these spirits of control</text>
  <text start="570.71" dur="5.01">Jezebel spirit is a good example they</text>
  <text start="573.5" dur="3.45">tend to control groups of people they</text>
  <text start="575.72" dur="2.85">control people</text>
  <text start="576.95" dur="4.01">they won&amp;#39;t ultimately want to get</text>
  <text start="578.57" dur="5.88">control of people who have a voice in</text>
  <text start="580.96" dur="4.99">society and then they they kind of twist</text>
  <text start="584.45" dur="3.62">their thoughts and manipulate them and</text>
  <text start="585.95" dur="5.87">get them to operate out of envy</text>
  <text start="588.07" dur="7.62">insecurities pride and arrogance and</text>
  <text start="591.82" dur="6.19">they control people and they get them to</text>
  <text start="595.69" dur="3.82">circle the wagons and attack people and</text>
  <text start="598.01" dur="8.79">then they draw people in who support</text>
  <text start="599.51" dur="10.44">them not naming names but the the battle</text>
  <text start="606.8" dur="5.16">is not against the individuals it is</text>
  <text start="609.95" dur="5.61">against the spirits that are controlling</text>
  <text start="611.96" dur="5.64">those people right so we do not wrestle</text>
  <text start="615.56" dur="3.36">against flesh and blood we don&amp;#39;t wrestle</text>
  <text start="617.6" dur="3.15">against people we wrestle against</text>
  <text start="618.92" dur="4.77">spiritual forces of wickedness in</text>
  <text start="620.75" dur="5.37">heavenly places so these people that are</text>
  <text start="623.69" dur="3.81">attacking you and attacking me you just</text>
  <text start="626.12" dur="3.48">have to realize they&amp;#39;re under the spirit</text>
  <text start="627.5" dur="5.61">of spirit that is an evil spirit that is</text>
  <text start="629.6" dur="7.17">controlling their them getting them to</text>
  <text start="633.11" dur="6.09">dance to their tune and going out and</text>
  <text start="636.77" dur="4.17">attacking people right so your prayers</text>
  <text start="639.2" dur="4.83">and your warfare are against the evil</text>
  <text start="640.94" dur="5.46">spirits not the individuals which is why</text>
  <text start="644.03" dur="5.13">I don&amp;#39;t attack people who attack me I</text>
  <text start="646.4" dur="5.19">don&amp;#39;t have to attack them my battle is</text>
  <text start="649.16" dur="4.02">not against them my battle is against</text>
  <text start="651.59" dur="6.21">the evil spirits that are controlling</text>
  <text start="653.18" dur="7.47">them right that&amp;#39;s the battle so I do</text>
  <text start="657.8" dur="5.81">warfare against evil spirits</text>
  <text start="660.65" dur="10.47">and fallen angels principalities powers</text>
  <text start="663.61" dur="10.15">whatever all right so if you start to</text>
  <text start="671.12" dur="5.37">battle against the people that are</text>
  <text start="673.76" dur="4.68">opposing you and attacking you you are</text>
  <text start="676.49" dur="5.01">you have already made your first mistake</text>
  <text start="678.44" dur="6.24">you don&amp;#39;t battle them you battle the</text>
  <text start="681.5" dur="6.11">spirits that are controlling them that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="684.68" dur="6.6">effective spiritual warfare if you can</text>
  <text start="687.61" dur="6.79">defeat disable or just completely ignore</text>
  <text start="691.28" dur="4.64">the evil spirit that is controlling</text>
  <text start="694.4" dur="4.53">these people that are attacking you</text>
  <text start="695.92" dur="4.78">that&amp;#39;s how you win the battle and I I</text>
  <text start="698.93" dur="6.27">win a lot of my battles just by ignoring</text>
  <text start="700.7" dur="11.01">people uh you know fly whatever</text>
  <text start="705.2" dur="8.79">fly okay go away fly goes away and I won</text>
  <text start="711.71" dur="5.37">the battle I mean the fly is trying to</text>
  <text start="713.99" dur="6.12">get my attention we&amp;#39;re using a metaphor</text>
  <text start="717.08" dur="7.05">here we&amp;#39;re using a exemple an</text>
  <text start="720.11" dur="6.09">illustration I could spend thirty</text>
  <text start="724.13" dur="3.54">minutes of my day running around my</text>
  <text start="726.2" dur="4.2">house looking for a flyswatter and</text>
  <text start="727.67" dur="4.8">chemicals and things to try to just go</text>
  <text start="730.4" dur="3.99">to battle against that fly I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="732.47" dur="5.61">destroy that fly I&amp;#39;m gonna kill that fly</text>
  <text start="734.39" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s going down this fly is just ruining</text>
  <text start="738.08" dur="4.2">my life</text>
  <text start="738.77" dur="6.39">but what&amp;#39;s the point of wasting a half</text>
  <text start="742.28" dur="4.86">hour doing a periscope and doing a</text>
  <text start="745.16" dur="4.71">YouTube video and writing a blog post</text>
  <text start="747.14" dur="5.22">about a fly that came into your room</text>
  <text start="749.87" dur="4.14">that tried to annoy you why not just</text>

  <text start="923.82" dur="8.06">that she needed to know about herself</text>
  <text start="929.43" dur="6.75">now I&amp;#39;m just gonna say this about dreams</text>
  <text start="931.88" dur="6.28">many times when you have a dream and you</text>
  <text start="936.18" dur="6.03">seem like you&amp;#39;re just getting your butt</text>

  <text start="976.55" dur="7.78">so if here&amp;#39;s an example if you have</text>
  <text start="980.97" dur="6.06">dreams where you&amp;#39;re driving a car and</text>
  <text start="984.33" dur="4.11">the brakes don&amp;#39;t work and you keep</text>

  <text start="1016.52" dur="4.08">saying no to people and you learn need</text>

  <text start="1020.6" dur="3.45">problem with people pleasing maybe you</text>
  <text start="1022.82" dur="4.29">just say yes to everybody because you</text>
  <text start="1024.05" dur="5.07">want to be accepted but that dream could</text>
  <text start="1027.11" dur="5.46">illustrate the idea that you need to</text>
  <text start="1029.12" dur="5.37">start saying no if you are in a car that</text>
  <text start="1032.57" dur="4.65">is the steering wheel doesn&amp;#39;t seem to</text>
  <text start="1034.49" dur="4.85">work very well and the car is careening</text>
  <text start="1037.22" dur="5.1">all over the place out of control</text>
  <text start="1039.34" dur="5.53">steering wheel is what determines the</text>
  <text start="1042.32" dur="4.86">direction of the car your car often</text>
  <text start="1044.87" dur="4.59">represents your life so if your steering</text>
  <text start="1047.18" dur="4.53">wheel doesn&amp;#39;t work God is telling you</text>
  <text start="1049.46" dur="4.95">probably that you have sort of lost</text>
  <text start="1051.71" dur="5.73">control or direction of your life and he</text>

  <text start="1070.1" dur="3.45">you&amp;#39;re in a dream and you&amp;#39;re in the</text>

  <text start="1073.55" dur="4.17">else is driving it God is probably</text>
  <text start="1075.59" dur="4.73">telling you that your life is being</text>
  <text start="1077.72" dur="6.57">controlled and steered by someone else</text>
  <text start="1080.32" dur="7.09">right so just kind of giving you some</text>
