  <text start="36.75" dur="5.82">digging it we have a big open kitchen</text>
  <text start="39.72" dur="5.04">dining room area right out of here in</text>

  <text start="66.75" dur="4.68">things first of all I haven&amp;#39;t been on</text>
  <text start="68.61" dur="4.53">periscope over the last week with the</text>
  <text start="71.43" dur="4.5">Las Vegas shooting and only other stuff</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="4.89">that&amp;#39;s been going on for two reasons</text>
  <text start="75.93" dur="5.34">number one I don&amp;#39;t really have anything</text>
  <text start="78.03" dur="5.61">to say about that other than you know</text>
  <text start="81.27" dur="5.04">praying for the families and friends of</text>
  <text start="83.64" dur="4.83">the victims God hasn&amp;#39;t given me any</text>
  <text start="86.31" dur="4.5">revelation on that and I&amp;#39;m trying to</text>
  <text start="88.47" dur="4.289">stay in my lane I know everybody else</text>
  <text start="90.81" dur="3.75">has opinions and views on it and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="92.759" dur="2.941">fine I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with that I</text>
  <text start="94.56" dur="3.479">don&amp;#39;t have anything to share with you</text>
  <text start="95.7" dur="4.55">that&amp;#39;s worth hearing so I&amp;#39;ve just</text>
  <text start="98.039" dur="4.86">decided not to say anything about it</text>
  <text start="100.25" dur="5.649">I&amp;#39;ve been waiting for God to speak to me</text>
  <text start="102.899" dur="5.401">so that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve been off periscope</text>
  <text start="105.899" dur="4.86">during the last week that&amp;#39;s not reason</text>
  <text start="108.3" dur="4.049">number one reason number two is I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="3.78">been doing some research over the last</text>
  <text start="112.349" dur="6.781">couple of days I got an email from a guy</text>
  <text start="114.539" dur="7.14">a couple days ago he does voiceover he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="119.13" dur="5.549">a voice-over artist and he primarily</text>
  <text start="121.679" dur="6.121">does audiobooks he records audio books</text>
  <text start="124.679" dur="4.92">for authors and he contacted me about</text>
  <text start="127.8" dur="5.4">six months ago asking if I would</text>
  <text start="129.599" dur="7.271">consider letting him record my books on</text>
  <text start="133.2" dur="6.82">audio and I was like</text>
  <text start="136.87" dur="6.479">you know I thought about this and talked</text>
  <text start="140.02" dur="6.12">about it with some friends and I came to</text>
  <text start="143.349" dur="5.401">two conclusions at that time one of</text>
  <text start="146.14" dur="5.37">which was that if I was going to do my</text>
  <text start="148.75" dur="5.51">books as audiobooks I would do the audio</text>
  <text start="151.51" dur="6.809">myself people want would like to hear me</text>
  <text start="154.26" dur="5.83">using my voice reading my own books no</text>
  <text start="158.319" dur="4.561">one was really interested in hearing</text>
  <text start="160.09" dur="5.04">somebody else do my books recording an</text>
  <text start="162.88" dur="3.9">audio book is fairly time intensive it</text>
  <text start="165.13" dur="4.02">takes a lot of time in the studio to</text>
  <text start="166.78" dur="3.84">record read every through everything</text>
  <text start="169.15" dur="4.11">edit everything take out all the</text>
  <text start="170.62" dur="4.979">mistakes it&amp;#39;s really time intensive and</text>
  <text start="173.26" dur="4.05">I never really gave serious thought I</text>
  <text start="175.599" dur="3.331">kind of put the audio book thing on the</text>
  <text start="177.31" dur="2.22">back shelf didn&amp;#39;t think too much about</text>
  <text start="178.93" dur="2.91">it</text>
  <text start="179.53" dur="4.53">audiobooks have a very small percentage</text>
  <text start="181.84" dur="4.47">of the market most people are reading</text>
  <text start="184.06" dur="5.67">still reading paperback books or hard</text>
  <text start="186.31" dur="5.759">covers ebooks have been gaining in</text>
  <text start="189.73" dur="5.28">popularity for years audiobooks are</text>
  <text start="192.069" dur="5.221">fairly new but audiobooks only have</text>
  <text start="195.01" dur="6.059">about between eleven and fourteen</text>
  <text start="197.29" dur="6">percent of the market so the question</text>
  <text start="201.069" dur="7.17">I&amp;#39;ve been wrestling with is is it worth</text>
  <text start="203.29" dur="8.37">my time an investment in time to record</text>
  <text start="208.239" dur="5.431">and upload an audio book file to for</text>
  <text start="211.66" dur="3.9">maybe 25 or 30 people are going to</text>
  <text start="213.67" dur="3.84">listen to it I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s been a</text>
  <text start="215.56" dur="5.429">question I&amp;#39;ve wrestled with for a long</text>
  <text start="217.51" dur="5.699">time but this guy emailed me again a</text>
  <text start="220.989" dur="5.191">couple days ago after I told him no</text>
  <text start="223.209" dur="5.43">that&amp;#39;s not interested he mailed me again</text>
  <text start="226.18" dur="4.589">and said hey you know I just wanted to</text>
  <text start="228.639" dur="4.47">jog your memory and let you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="230.769" dur="4.981">still available and I just recorded a</text>
  <text start="233.109" dur="4.141">book for Bill Johnson and you know if</text>
  <text start="235.75" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re still interested in thinking</text>
  <text start="237.25" dur="4.59">about audiobooks available and I have a</text>
  <text start="239.65" dur="5.13">friend who lives in Australia he has</text>
  <text start="241.84" dur="5.61">published 30 books and I think most of</text>
  <text start="244.78" dur="4.35">them are available on audio he&amp;#39;s like</text>
  <text start="247.45" dur="3">hey mate you need to get with the</text>
  <text start="249.13" dur="2.82">program I mean you get your books on</text>
  <text start="250.45" dur="3.689">audio if you&amp;#39;re not gonna do it yourself</text>
  <text start="251.95" dur="4.89">have somebody else do it pay somebody to</text>
  <text start="254.139" dur="4.65">record your books for you so this is a</text>
  <text start="256.84" dur="3.42">thing that&amp;#39;s been going on with me for a</text>
  <text start="258.789" dur="2.111">couple of years I&amp;#39;ve been wrestling with</text>
  <text start="260.26" dur="3.969">it</text>
  <text start="260.9" dur="6.6">and after we read this guy&amp;#39;s email it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="264.229" dur="4.5">like man you&amp;#39;re killing me smalls I got</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="2.46">something else that you have to think</text>
  <text start="268.729" dur="3.631">about something that&amp;#39;s going to take</text>
  <text start="269.96" dur="4.89">more time more learning more research</text>
  <text start="272.36" dur="4.77">more equipment so the last couple of</text>
  <text start="274.85" dur="5.4">days I&amp;#39;ve been researching what it would</text>
  <text start="277.13" dur="5.88">take to record audio books the equipment</text>
  <text start="280.25" dur="6.479">how how you record height upload the</text>
  <text start="283.01" dur="5.28">files all that stuff and I came to the</text>
  <text start="286.729" dur="3.69">conclusion that it&amp;#39;s actually not as</text>
  <text start="288.29" dur="3.84">difficult as it seems I have the</text>
  <text start="290.419" dur="3">software that&amp;#39;s necessary I actually had</text>
  <text start="292.13" dur="3.42">the hardware that&amp;#39;s necessary and</text>
  <text start="293.419" dur="5.22">learned some things watching some</text>
  <text start="295.55" dur="5.13">YouTube videos about how to edit the</text>
  <text start="298.639" dur="5.101">audio file they take out background</text>
  <text start="300.68" dur="4.44">noise I watch some YouTube videos from</text>
  <text start="303.74" dur="3.989">some guys who do this for a living</text>
  <text start="305.12" dur="4.47">and they showed me some tips that would</text>
  <text start="307.729" dur="4.201">make it really easy for me to the audio</text>
  <text start="309.59" dur="4.65">audiobooks so I had decided I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="311.93" dur="3.87">record my own audiobooks and that is</text>
  <text start="314.24" dur="3.42">what I&amp;#39;m going to be doing today I have</text>
  <text start="315.8" dur="4.53">a couple of mp3 messages I want to</text>
  <text start="317.66" dur="5.28">record but I&amp;#39;m going to start recording</text>
  <text start="320.33" dur="5.01">my own audiobooks you can learn anything</text>
  <text start="322.94" dur="4.979">on YouTube you really can I was amazed</text>
  <text start="325.34" dur="4.32">and pocus amazed I need to learn how to</text>
  <text start="327.919" dur="2.97">do something I&amp;#39;m like I look on YouTube</text>
  <text start="329.66" dur="2.819">somebody&amp;#39;s probably got a video you just</text>
  <text start="330.889" dur="3.871">gotta learn learn how to search for the</text>
  <text start="332.479" dur="5.25">right keywords that&amp;#39;s what i&amp;#39;ma do for</text>
  <text start="334.76" dur="4.92">the last few days is researching how to</text>

  <text start="339.68" dur="3.69">gonna do it</text>
  <text start="340.479" dur="4.301">audiobooks are gaining in popularity a</text>
  <text start="343.37" dur="2.669">lot of people like them because they can</text>

  <text start="353.99" dur="4.83">been on Twitter and periscope and</text>
  <text start="355.34" dur="5.49">Facebook talking about the shooting I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="358.82" dur="4.92">been in the process of learning the</text>
  <text start="360.83" dur="5.79">reason why I called you here is not to</text>
  <text start="363.74" dur="4.53">talk about audiobooks it is to tell you</text>
  <text start="366.62" dur="5.549">about a vision and a dream that I had</text>
  <text start="368.27" dur="6.579">last night that I think most of you are</text>
  <text start="372.169" dur="5.83">going to find very encouraging</text>
  <text start="374.849" dur="6.27">all right so if you listen to Adam</text>
  <text start="377.999" dur="5.22">Gingrich you know that there are a</text>
  <text start="381.119" dur="6.681">number of things going on in the federal</text>
  <text start="383.219" dur="7.53">government that could potentially cause</text>
  <text start="387.8" dur="5.609">a lot of problems for people in</text>
  <text start="390.749" dur="6.42">government there is the Elan scandal</text>
  <text start="393.409" dur="5.951">there are 25 Democrat senators are sort</text>
  <text start="397.169" dur="4.14">of congressmen who are potentially</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="3.959">wrapped up in the salon scandal where</text>
  <text start="401.309" dur="5.64">they were paying the Erewhon brothers a</text>
  <text start="403.319" dur="7.31">lot of money to do IT work and as we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="406.949" dur="5.851">finding out from Judicial Watch and ACLJ</text>
  <text start="410.629" dur="4.63">there is some pretty sketchy activity</text>
  <text start="412.8" dur="3.859">going on and these bonds are they were</text>
  <text start="415.259" dur="3.84">involved in some criminal activity</text>
  <text start="416.659" dur="4.6">Congress doesn&amp;#39;t want this information</text>
  <text start="419.099" dur="3.78">coming out they don&amp;#39;t want an</text>
  <text start="421.259" dur="4.38">investigation they don&amp;#39;t want this</text>
  <text start="422.879" dur="5.76">prosecuted because it would make a lot</text>
  <text start="425.639" dur="6.33">of people in Congress it would expose</text>
  <text start="428.639" dur="5.58">them and it would potentially cause a</text>
  <text start="431.969" dur="3.96">lot of them to resign it Congress does</text>
  <text start="434.219" dur="2.97">not want to talk about this I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="435.929" dur="3.66">to investigate it they want it to go</text>
  <text start="437.189" dur="3.54">away here&amp;#39;s a problem for Congress now</text>
  <text start="439.589" dur="2.401">I&amp;#39;ll get to the dream of division in a</text>
  <text start="440.729" dur="3.42">minute I just want to explain to you</text>
  <text start="441.99" dur="4.679">what what&amp;#39;s been going on there are</text>
  <text start="444.149" dur="5.281">these situations out there that if</text>
  <text start="446.669" dur="6.39">they&amp;#39;re exposed if they are talked about</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="5.31">in the media they have that huge</text>
  <text start="453.059" dur="3.81">potential liability for people in</text>
  <text start="454.74" dur="4.829">government so the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="456.869" dur="4.83">doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk about it but the</text>
  <text start="459.569" dur="6.72">alternative media like Judicial Watch</text>
  <text start="461.699" dur="9.15">and ACLJ and citizen journalists and</text>
  <text start="466.289" dur="7.08">true fondant thomas paine they have</text>
  <text start="470.849" dur="5.58">information that they are bringing out</text>
  <text start="473.369" dur="5.52">and although the mainstream media wants</text>
  <text start="476.429" dur="5.051">to cover this all up this information is</text>
  <text start="478.889" dur="4.301">coming up they</text>
  <text start="481.48" dur="3.03">keep digging they keep digging and they</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="3.18">keep digging and they&amp;#39;re exposing this</text>
  <text start="484.51" dur="4.44">information and it I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="486.37" dur="4.38">gonna go away so let me tell you about</text>
  <text start="488.95" dur="5.16">the dream that I had last night first</text>
  <text start="490.75" dur="4.65">I&amp;#39;ll say about the dream it was but most</text>
  <text start="494.11" dur="5.55">people would think was a very boring</text>
  <text start="495.4" dur="6.99">dream but it&amp;#39;s highly symbolic so let me</text>
  <text start="499.66" dur="6.21">tell you about it in this dream I was</text>
  <text start="502.39" dur="6.11">working in something like a state park</text>
  <text start="505.87" dur="7.26">or a national park or a State Forest</text>
  <text start="508.5" dur="6.55">lots of large trees everywhere and roads</text>
  <text start="513.13" dur="5.73">that went through it so kind of like a</text>
  <text start="515.05" dur="6.3">big national park and I knew there are a</text>
  <text start="518.86" dur="4.53">lot of large trees that were dead but</text>
  <text start="521.35" dur="5.04">they hadn&amp;#39;t fallen they were dead and</text>
  <text start="523.39" dur="5.73">they had leaned and they were being held</text>
  <text start="526.39" dur="6.6">up by other trees so you have large</text>
  <text start="529.12" dur="8.46">trees in the dream all of a sudden at</text>
  <text start="532.99" dur="7.23">once all these dead trees came down it</text>
  <text start="537.58" dur="6.27">came to the ground I didn&amp;#39;t see them all</text>
  <text start="540.22" dur="6.36">fall but I was aware that they all came</text>
  <text start="543.85" dur="4.17">down to the ground virtually like that</text>
  <text start="546.58" dur="4.47">all at the same time they just came down</text>
  <text start="548.02" dur="4.41">and they were all over this park that I</text>
  <text start="551.05" dur="3.69">was working at and they were blocking</text>
  <text start="552.43" dur="4.62">the roads now as far as I know in the</text>
  <text start="554.74" dur="4.08">dream nobody got injured no cars got</text>
  <text start="557.05" dur="4.53">crushed no one got hurt it&amp;#39;s just that</text>
  <text start="558.82" dur="5.79">these old dead trees all came down to</text>
  <text start="561.58" dur="6.03">the ground at once and I was aware I was</text>
  <text start="564.61" dur="5.49">on duty working when the trees came down</text>
  <text start="567.61" dur="3.72">and I told someone that I was working</text>

  <text start="581.74" dur="4.47">one can go anywhere we have to cut up</text>
  <text start="584.14" dur="5.1">these trees and get rid of them and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="586.21" dur="4.92">gonna take a long time for us to cut all</text>
  <text start="589.24" dur="3.48">these trees up and get and call them out</text>
  <text start="591.13" dur="3.36">and get rid of them all right that was a</text>
  <text start="592.72" dur="3.39">dream right</text>

  <text start="614.68" dur="6.75">interpret dreams and trees are men if</text>
  <text start="618.43" dur="6">you go to Daniel chapter 4 trees are not</text>
  <text start="621.43" dur="5.36">only men trees are a specific kind of</text>
  <text start="624.43" dur="6">man so if you go to Daniel chapter 4</text>
  <text start="626.79" dur="5.56">King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream and in</text>
  <text start="630.43" dur="3.779">the dream this is the second dream that</text>
  <text start="632.35" dur="3.75">he had Daniel interpret Daniel</text>
  <text start="634.209" dur="4.17">interpreted Nebuchadnezzar&amp;#39;s first dream</text>
  <text start="636.1" dur="4.409">which was the image of gold silver</text>
  <text start="638.379" dur="4.26">bronze and clay that was in Daniel</text>
  <text start="640.509" dur="4.05">chapter 2 Nebuchadnezzar had a second</text>
  <text start="642.639" dur="4.17">dream in Daniel chapter 4 and Daniel</text>
  <text start="644.559" dur="4.621">interpreted that dream and in the dream</text>
  <text start="646.809" dur="4.861">Nebuchadnezzar saw this large tree his</text>
  <text start="649.18" dur="5.069">tree grew up into the sky was massive</text>
  <text start="651.67" dur="4.769">tree shade for everyone the birds and</text>
  <text start="654.249" dur="4.38">animals came and birds nested in it the</text>
  <text start="656.439" dur="4.08">animals found shade in her right Daniel</text>
  <text start="658.629" dur="6.15">interpreted the dream and he told</text>
  <text start="660.519" dur="7.05">Nebuchadnezzar Oh King you are the tree</text>
  <text start="664.779" dur="5.1">that tree symbolizes you generally</text>
  <text start="667.569" dur="5.63">speaking when you have a dream and you</text>
  <text start="669.879" dur="6.93">see large trees they represent leaders</text>
  <text start="673.199" dur="6.25">many times political leaders and in the</text>
  <text start="676.809" dur="5.52">dream that Nebuchadnezzar had the tree</text>
  <text start="679.449" dur="6.75">was cut down which meant the end of his</text>
  <text start="682.329" dur="6.12">reign as a political leader for a period</text>
  <text start="686.199" dur="4.531">of time and you can read it in Daniel</text>
  <text start="688.449" dur="5.81">chapter 4 if you&amp;#39;re interested go go</text>
  <text start="690.73" dur="6.419">read it the angel actually was sent to</text>
  <text start="694.259" dur="5.08">remove Nebuchadnezzar&amp;#39;s reign for a</text>
  <text start="697.149" dur="4.891">period of seven years nebuchadnezzar</text>
  <text start="699.339" dur="4.831">went became insane and he wandered</text>
  <text start="702.04" dur="4.349">around in the wilderness living like an</text>
  <text start="704.17" dur="4.62">animal and then his reign as king was</text>
  <text start="706.389" dur="5.851">restored to him so that was all shown in</text>
  <text start="708.79" dur="6.599">the dream in dreams large trees</text>
  <text start="712.24" dur="5.25">typically represent leaders and I think</text>
  <text start="715.389" dur="6.271">in this dream it represents political</text>
  <text start="717.49" dur="6.36">leaders let&amp;#39;s interpret my dream if I am</text>
  <text start="721.66" dur="6">currently living any time and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="723.85" dur="5.729">working in an area with other people</text>
  <text start="727.66" dur="4.95">where there are many political leaders</text>
  <text start="729.579" dur="3.661">who are effectively dead but have not</text>
  <text start="732.61" dur="4.14">yet</text>
  <text start="733.24" dur="7.289">and been removed what this dream could</text>
  <text start="736.75" dur="7.709">symbolize is that although these leaders</text>
  <text start="740.529" dur="7.441">are effectively have no life in them</text>
  <text start="744.459" dur="5.011">okay so symbolically if the trees are</text>
  <text start="747.97" dur="3.809">dead it means they have no life in them</text>
  <text start="749.47" dur="5.489">means they&amp;#39;re not producing any fruit it</text>
  <text start="751.779" dur="4.741">means they&amp;#39;re not being productive does</text>
  <text start="754.959" dur="2.911">it mean that they&amp;#39;re literally dead it</text>
  <text start="756.52" dur="4.35">means that they&amp;#39;re not productive</text>
  <text start="757.87" dur="4.89">they are obstructing the productivity of</text>
  <text start="760.87" dur="4.05">the forest all right now think about</text>
  <text start="762.76" dur="4.19">Congress what is Congress doing right</text>
  <text start="764.92" dur="6.66">now Congress is obstructing progress</text>
  <text start="766.95" dur="7.329">they&amp;#39;re preventing good leaders who want</text>
  <text start="771.58" dur="3.54">to actually enact legislation to make</text>
  <text start="774.279" dur="3.391">America great again</text>
  <text start="775.12" dur="4.95">and the status quo leaders in Washington</text>
  <text start="777.67" dur="5.46">are preventing this from happen just by</text>
  <text start="780.07" dur="6.57">being there okay the deadwood needs to</text>
  <text start="783.13" dur="5.399">be cleared out so in the dream I saw all</text>
  <text start="786.64" dur="3.78">of these trees fall at the same time</text>
  <text start="788.529" dur="4.231">they all came down all right now think</text>
  <text start="790.42" dur="4.859">about this this is interesting in the</text>
  <text start="792.76" dur="5.88">dream the trees were being held up by</text>
  <text start="795.279" dur="5.641">other trees the useless</text>
  <text start="798.64" dur="5.069">political leaders were being propped up</text>
  <text start="800.92" dur="5.64">by other political leaders and then one</text>
  <text start="803.709" dur="5.13">day at one event something happened the</text>
  <text start="806.56" dur="5.399">political leaders who were propping up</text>
  <text start="808.839" dur="5.161">the useless ones let go and all of the</text>
  <text start="811.959" dur="3.57">useless ones fell to the ground and then</text>
  <text start="814" dur="5.49">it was time to clear them out I think</text>
  <text start="815.529" dur="6.451">the dream suggests that there is going</text>
  <text start="819.49" dur="5">to become an event or a series of events</text>
  <text start="821.98" dur="5.37">in the near future that is going to make</text>
  <text start="824.49" dur="6.219">useless and effective political leaders</text>
  <text start="827.35" dur="6.12">fall and it&amp;#39;s going to allow people like</text>
  <text start="830.709" dur="5.581">us to clean them out of Congress to get</text>
  <text start="833.47" dur="5.55">rid of them years ago this guy that I</text>
  <text start="836.29" dur="4.73">know who is a very prophetic leader saw</text>
  <text start="839.02" dur="5.46">a news headline in a dream and that</text>
  <text start="841.02" dur="6.34">headline was resignation fever hits</text>
  <text start="844.48" dur="5.099">Washington I believe we&amp;#39;re going to see</text>
  <text start="847.36" dur="4.65">something come in the future that is</text>
  <text start="849.579" dur="4.38">going to cause a lot of political</text>
  <text start="852.01" dur="5.6">leaders to resign from office we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="853.959" dur="6.481">already seeing a number of swampy</text>
  <text start="857.61" dur="5.14">Republicans decide they&amp;#39;re not going to</text>
  <text start="860.44" dur="4.17">run again why are they not running again</text>
  <text start="862.75" dur="4.22">because they know the jig is up they</text>
  <text start="864.61" dur="4.969">know something is happening in Congress</text>
  <text start="866.97" dur="4.679">in America that they that they can see</text>
  <text start="869.579" dur="5.13">the writing on the wall they can tell</text>
  <text start="871.649" dur="5.79">that their time is limited and that</text>
  <text start="874.709" dur="6.06">there is a critical mass in the United</text>
  <text start="877.439" dur="6.39">States of voters that have revolted</text>
  <text start="880.769" dur="5.341">against the establishment and they can</text>
  <text start="883.829" dur="5.161">see that critical mass growing and they</text>
  <text start="886.11" dur="5.94">can see that their agenda of corruption</text>
  <text start="888.99" dur="4.469">and nepotism is on the decline they can</text>
  <text start="892.05" dur="3.69">see the writing it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s going away</text>
  <text start="893.459" dur="4.68">it&amp;#39;s losing the status quo is losing</text>
  <text start="895.74" dur="3.719">favor and it&amp;#39;s being replaced by people</text>
  <text start="898.139" dur="3.271">who want to make America great again who</text>
  <text start="899.459" dur="6.06">want to drain the swamp right so you</text>
  <text start="901.41" dur="6.479">have swampy GOP leaders who are deciding</text>
  <text start="905.519" dur="4.26">they don&amp;#39;t want to run again the next</text>
  <text start="907.889" dur="3.12">thing we need to see happen is we need</text>
  <text start="909.779" dur="3.391">to see a lot of people resigned from</text>
  <text start="911.009" dur="4.711">Congress and I think that&amp;#39;s the next</text>
  <text start="913.17" dur="4.769">thing we&amp;#39;re going to see we&amp;#39;re gonna see</text>
  <text start="915.72" dur="4.229">people resigning from Congress people</text>
  <text start="917.939" dur="4.83">who are actively in office resigning</text>
  <text start="919.949" dur="6.87">they&amp;#39;re just gonna get out because</text>
  <text start="922.769" dur="5.82">things are going to be exposed and this</text>
  <text start="926.819" dur="5.19">this status quo is going to continue to</text>
  <text start="928.589" dur="5.79">lose favor and people like us who want</text>
  <text start="932.009" dur="5.221">to make America great again are going to</text>
  <text start="934.379" dur="4.621">continue putting on pressure to hold</text>
  <text start="937.23" dur="4.229">these people accountable and it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="939" dur="5.279">to get more difficult for them the more</text>
  <text start="941.459" dur="4.891">we engage the political process the more</text>
  <text start="944.279" dur="4.461">difficult it is for them for the swamp</text>
  <text start="946.35" dur="4.38">to continue doing what they want to do</text>
  <text start="948.74" dur="4.209">now I&amp;#39;m gonna tell you about the vision</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="3.659">that I had right before I went to sleep</text>
  <text start="952.949" dur="3.781">Denise said I had just come home from</text>
  <text start="954.389" dur="4.021">dinner and I was pretty tired and I was</text>
  <text start="956.73" dur="2.729">still dressed I just flopped on the bed</text>
  <text start="958.41" dur="4.049">and I was laying there and I had my eyes</text>
  <text start="959.459" dur="4.56">closed they saw this vision and I it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="962.459" dur="3.511">not like I don&amp;#39;t see visions or often</text>
  <text start="964.019" dur="6.24">you know I I do this one was really</text>
  <text start="965.97" dur="6.57">interesting so him the vision I saw what</text>
  <text start="970.259" dur="7.531">I can only describe as a swamp I saw</text>
  <text start="972.54" dur="10.68">this green dirty nasty water and I saw a</text>
  <text start="977.79" dur="7.799">man come up out of the water he emerged</text>
  <text start="983.22" dur="3.989">from under the water and he looked like</text>
  <text start="985.589" dur="2.401">he had been in the wilderness for about</text>
  <text start="987.209" dur="4.11">three years</text>
  <text start="987.99" dur="5.88">he had this scruffy beard you know his</text>
  <text start="991.319" dur="5.281">hair wasn&amp;#39;t wasn&amp;#39;t cut but I could tell</text>
  <text start="993.87" dur="6.36">it was Steve Bannon he rose up out of</text>
  <text start="996.6" dur="7.68">the swamp water and he had this look of</text>
  <text start="1000.23" dur="6.72">nation on his face like he was going to</text>
  <text start="1004.28" dur="4.05">accomplish something great he just had</text>
  <text start="1006.95" dur="3.48">this look of determination on his face</text>
  <text start="1008.33" dur="2.79">so that was the first thing I saw in the</text>
  <text start="1010.43" dur="3.9">vision</text>
  <text start="1011.12" dur="5.01">Steve Bannon rising out of the swamp</text>
  <text start="1014.33" dur="4.77">which they look of determination on his</text>
  <text start="1016.13" dur="5.55">face right after that I saw another man</text>
  <text start="1019.1" dur="4.41">come up out of the swamp and it was</text>
  <text start="1021.68" dur="3.45">again he looked like he&amp;#39;d been in the</text>
  <text start="1023.51" dur="6.42">wilderness for two or three years</text>
  <text start="1025.13" dur="8.07">unshaven Harold straggly and it was Rex</text>
  <text start="1029.93" dur="5.07">Tillerson again it was he didn&amp;#39;t look</text>
  <text start="1033.2" dur="4.62">like Rex Tillerson on the video</text>
  <text start="1035" dur="5.16">yesterday he had beard his face was all</text>
  <text start="1037.82" dur="4.44">it just looked like he&amp;#39;d been in combat</text>
  <text start="1040.16" dur="4.11">on the wilderness for a long time and he</text>
  <text start="1042.26" dur="4.05">had this look of absolute determination</text>
  <text start="1044.27" dur="4.83">on his face as he came up out of this</text>
  <text start="1046.31" dur="6.15">then I saw a third person come up out of</text>
  <text start="1049.1" dur="5.4">the swamp and it was general mattis his</text>
  <text start="1052.46" dur="3.81">face again you could just look in his</text>
  <text start="1054.5" dur="4.14">eyes and see this determination he came</text>
  <text start="1056.27" dur="4.62">up out of the swamp so I saw these three</text>
  <text start="1058.64" dur="3.48">people coming up out of the swampy water</text>
  <text start="1060.89" dur="6.51">rising up with a look of determination</text>
  <text start="1062.12" dur="8.64">on their face and then I saw George</text>
  <text start="1067.4" dur="7.29">Soros and he wasn&amp;#39;t in the swamp he was</text>
  <text start="1070.76" dur="6.87">sitting on a bench wow I just got some</text>
  <text start="1074.69" dur="5.31">revelation about the bench George Soros</text>
  <text start="1077.63" dur="5.25">was sitting on a bench like a park bench</text>
  <text start="1080" dur="5.37">and he had this usual look of George</text>
  <text start="1082.88" dur="4.86">Soros you know Singer and he just looked</text>
  <text start="1085.37" dur="5.55">like a miserable angry old man and then</text>
  <text start="1087.74" dur="5.55">he fell over on the bench and it looked</text>
  <text start="1090.92" dur="4.88">like he died he wasn&amp;#39;t moving wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1093.29" dur="4.83">breathing just looked like he died so</text>
  <text start="1095.8" dur="4.6">symbolically what does it mean when</text>
  <text start="1098.12" dur="3.78">someone is put on the bench it means</text>
  <text start="1100.4" dur="3.24">they are taken out of action if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1101.9" dur="3.96">in basketball okay</text>
  <text start="1103.64" dur="4.74">the team the players that are on the</text>
  <text start="1105.86" dur="3.84">court are the ones that are scoring the</text>
  <text start="1108.38" dur="3.54">points and they&amp;#39;re playing they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1109.7" dur="3.51">engaged when you ride the bench when</text>
  <text start="1111.92" dur="3.9">you&amp;#39;re on the bench you&amp;#39;re out of action</text>
  <text start="1113.21" dur="5.7">though George Soros on the bench</text>
  <text start="1115.82" dur="5.7">I think this vision might mean that</text>
  <text start="1118.91" dur="3.06">there is going to come up out of the</text>
  <text start="1121.52" dur="3.509">swamp</text>
  <text start="1121.97" dur="7.409">some people like Bannon and</text>
  <text start="1125.029" dur="6.84">and Tolson who are going to help drain</text>
  <text start="1129.379" dur="4.471">the swamp help expose the corruption and</text>
  <text start="1131.869" dur="3.9">put people like Soros on the bench out</text>
  <text start="1133.85" dur="3.6">of business now I don&amp;#39;t know if this</text>
  <text start="1135.769" dur="4.11">vision indicates that services gonna</text>
  <text start="1137.45" dur="5.37">actually die he&amp;#39;s an old guy he&amp;#39;s in his</text>
  <text start="1139.879" dur="6.24">80s eventually services gonna die but I</text>
  <text start="1142.82" dur="5.459">think the vision probably portrays the</text>
  <text start="1146.119" dur="4.41">idea that Soros is going to be taken out</text>
  <text start="1148.279" dur="6.03">of action that his influence in</text>
  <text start="1150.529" dur="6.36">Washington gone that would be a good</text>
  <text start="1154.309" dur="4.891">thing that would be a good thing and</text>
  <text start="1156.889" dur="4.11">think about this if Soros has taken out</text>
  <text start="1159.2" dur="4.919">of action and his ability to influence</text>
  <text start="1160.999" dur="6.841">the government is cut off that will give</text>
  <text start="1164.119" dur="6.63">the swampy creatures in Congress even</text>
  <text start="1167.84" dur="5.549">less reason to stick around if their</text>
  <text start="1170.749" dur="6.66">financial support from Soros is gone</text>
  <text start="1173.389" dur="5.61">well then the swamp loses and maybe we</text>
  <text start="1177.409" dur="3.09">have a whole bunch of large trees</text>
  <text start="1178.999" dur="7.26">falling and being cleared out of the</text>
  <text start="1180.499" dur="9">swamp so anyway that is that is what God</text>
  <text start="1186.259" dur="5.37">is showing me interesting stuff I think</text>
  <text start="1189.499" dur="3.571">I just wanted to share with you some</text>
