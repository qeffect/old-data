  <text start="185.799" dur="4.861">you that it was a warning dream about</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="6.37">something that could potentially happen</text>
  <text start="190.66" dur="5.579">to me and my business in the future and</text>
  <text start="194.56" dur="5.88">it was God giving me a little heads-up</text>
  <text start="196.239" dur="6.151">to make sure that all the I&amp;#39;s are dotted</text>
  <text start="200.44" dur="4.47">and the T&amp;#39;s are crossed and all that</text>

  <text start="229.299" dur="5.581">we are going through the book hearing</text>
  <text start="232.6" dur="4.919">God&amp;#39;s voice made simple it was my I</text>
  <text start="234.88" dur="7.02">don&amp;#39;t know fifth or sixth book that I</text>
  <text start="237.519" dur="7.111">published and it is all about learning</text>
  <text start="241.9" dur="9.059">to hear God&amp;#39;s voice or hearing God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="244.63" dur="9.449">voice better and this chapter chapter 3</text>
  <text start="250.959" dur="5.941">we&amp;#39;re going to cover today is myths and</text>
  <text start="254.079" dur="5.31">misconceptions about hearing God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="256.9" dur="5">and there are a lot of them and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="259.389" dur="6.27">going to plow through some of them and</text>
  <text start="261.9" dur="6.25">if you know people have questions that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="265.659" dur="7.561">cool I&amp;#39;ll be happy</text>
  <text start="268.15" dur="6.799">to entertain questions but there are a</text>
  <text start="273.22" dur="5.88">couple of things I want to go through</text>
  <text start="274.949" dur="7.931">and the one of the big misconceptions</text>
  <text start="279.1" dur="7.76">that people have myth is that God does</text>
  <text start="282.88" dur="6.21">not speak directly to man now</text>
  <text start="286.86" dur="6.04">some people who are agnostic sin</text>
  <text start="289.09" dur="5.85">atheists they one of the reasons they</text>
  <text start="292.9" dur="4.68">don&amp;#39;t believe God speaks to man is</text>
  <text start="294.94" dur="8.699">because they look at the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="297.58" dur="8.85">and they you know Jews and Catholics and</text>
  <text start="303.639" dur="3.84">Christians and different groups look at</text>
  <text start="306.43" dur="3.84">the scripture the Old Testament</text>
  <text start="307.479" dur="4.981">Scriptures and say that was God was</text>
  <text start="310.27" dur="8.58">giving direction to the potato pots and</text>
  <text start="312.46" dur="9.39">their prophets and he instructed them on</text>
  <text start="318.85" dur="8.629">what to do in his covenant with Israel</text>
  <text start="321.85" dur="11.039">and they look at things like God telling</text>
  <text start="327.479" dur="12.761">the Jews to wipe out all of these pagan</text>
  <text start="332.889" dur="9.451">nations in the Middle East and they look</text>
  <text start="340.24" dur="3.84">at that and go okay wait a minute so on</text>
  <text start="342.34" dur="4.41">the one hand you say that God is loving</text>
  <text start="344.08" dur="4.79">on the other hand you say that God told</text>
  <text start="346.75" dur="5.55">his people to wipe out this entire</text>
  <text start="348.87" dur="3.82">nation of people kill them all get rid</text>
  <text start="352.3" dur="3.21">of them</text>
  <text start="352.69" dur="6.3">right so they look at that and say well</text>
  <text start="355.51" dur="5.7">that is obviously hypocrisy God is not a</text>
  <text start="358.99" dur="4.5">God of love if he tells people to go and</text>
  <text start="361.21" dur="7.35">kill and wage war and wipe out entire</text>
  <text start="363.49" dur="8.63">tribes right so some people object to</text>
  <text start="368.56" dur="11.34">the idea that God speaks to mankind</text>
  <text start="372.12" dur="10.93">because they observe what God has</text>
  <text start="379.9" dur="4.739">supposedly said in the past and they</text>
  <text start="383.05" dur="4.41">don&amp;#39;t understand it and don&amp;#39;t like it</text>
  <text start="384.639" dur="4.801">and they discount that as that obviously</text>
  <text start="387.46" dur="3.389">wasn&amp;#39;t from God they were maybe</text>
  <text start="389.44" dur="3.449">hallucinating maybe they thought they</text>
  <text start="390.849" dur="3.781">were hearing God&amp;#39;s voice whatever but</text>
  <text start="392.889" dur="4.471">they weren&amp;#39;t hearing God because God is</text>
  <text start="394.63" dur="4.65">God of love if he exists right agnostics</text>
  <text start="397.36" dur="3.309">and atheists would say if God exists he</text>
  <text start="399.28" dur="3.37">would be a God of love</text>
  <text start="400.669" dur="4.31">and he would not endorse that kind of</text>
  <text start="402.65" dur="5.759">behavior hey Ravi Kapoor is on hey Ravi</text>
  <text start="404.979" dur="6.101">so one of the things I would like to say</text>
  <text start="408.409" dur="6.391">I haven&amp;#39;t covered this in the book but</text>
  <text start="411.08" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s worth considering the revelation</text>
  <text start="414.8" dur="6.269">that God has given to mankind is a</text>
  <text start="416.87" dur="6.539">progressive revelation it changes over</text>
  <text start="421.069" dur="5.521">time the nature of the revelation</text>
  <text start="423.409" dur="7.171">changes and the revelation itself</text>
  <text start="426.59" dur="5.939">changes and God speaks to different</text>
  <text start="430.58" dur="6.41">groups of people about different things</text>
  <text start="432.529" dur="8.76">at different times for certain purposes</text>
  <text start="436.99" dur="7.78">when God was speaking to Abraham he was</text>
  <text start="441.289" dur="7.65">trying to recruit someone who would be</text>
  <text start="444.77" dur="6.57">the father of a nation in a nation that</text>
  <text start="448.939" dur="4.111">he would speak through and he would show</text>
  <text start="451.34" dur="3.9">his love and mercy and his kindness</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="4.649">through that nation and he wanted</text>
  <text start="455.24" dur="6.269">Abraham to be the father of that nation</text>
  <text start="457.699" dur="8.19">all right that was God&amp;#39;s purpose for</text>
  <text start="461.509" dur="8.671">speaking with Abraham Isaac Jacob he was</text>
  <text start="465.889" dur="6.381">trying to raise up this family where he</text>
  <text start="470.18" dur="5.579">could demonstrate Kazuko is on</text>
  <text start="472.27" dur="5.139">good-evening Kazuko I hope everything is</text>
  <text start="475.759" dur="3.93">going okay in Japan with that typhoon</text>
  <text start="477.409" dur="4.32">we&amp;#39;ve been watching that we&amp;#39;re praying</text>
  <text start="479.689" dur="5.611">for you just want to let you know Kazuko</text>
  <text start="481.729" dur="7.65">and all your friends in Japan so God</text>
  <text start="485.3" dur="8.22">spoke through Abraham Isaac and Jacob</text>
  <text start="489.379" dur="7.85">and the patriarchs because he was trying</text>
  <text start="493.52" dur="7.56">to raise up this family of people who</text>
  <text start="497.229" dur="8.701">God could demonstrate his real nature</text>
  <text start="501.08" dur="8.67">and character through as an opposing</text>
  <text start="505.93" dur="7.63">narrative or an opposing deity to all</text>
  <text start="509.75" dur="7.5">the pagan gods of Egypt and all the</text>
  <text start="513.56" dur="5.849">other ancient civilizations the the</text>
  <text start="517.25" dur="5.88">false gods that were worshipped by all</text>
  <text start="519.409" dur="6.3">the other nations God this is chapter 3</text>
  <text start="523.13" dur="3.66">myths and misconceptions and this is I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="525.709" dur="5.581">going down a little bit of a rabbit</text>
  <text start="526.79" dur="6.11">trail here but his purpose to it so God</text>
  <text start="531.29" dur="7.58">spoke to</text>
  <text start="532.9" dur="10.83">the prophets Jeremiah Daniel Isaiah at</text>
  <text start="538.87" dur="6.87">different times as they were as their</text>
  <text start="543.73" dur="3.84">nation was being developed as their</text>
  <text start="545.74" dur="2.31">nation was learning obedience to the</text>
  <text start="547.57" dur="4.02">Lord</text>
  <text start="548.05" dur="4.68">whenever the nation of Israel would obey</text>
  <text start="551.59" dur="3.9">the Lord they would have they would have</text>
  <text start="552.73" dur="4.41">good Kings who were righteous Kings who</text>
  <text start="555.49" dur="3.09">would follow the commandments of God</text>
  <text start="557.14" dur="3.66">follow God&amp;#39;s heart they would be blessed</text>
  <text start="558.58" dur="4.2">in a lot of different ways God would</text>
  <text start="560.8" dur="4.59">give them victory over their enemies he</text>
  <text start="562.78" dur="4.14">prompt give them a promised land he gave</text>
  <text start="565.39" dur="3.09">them victory when they went into the</text>
  <text start="566.92" dur="5.1">Promised Land to wipe out these tribes</text>
  <text start="568.48" dur="7.05">now one of the tribes that God told them</text>
  <text start="572.02" dur="6.8">to wipe out was actually a tribe that</text>
  <text start="575.53" dur="5.88">had been infiltrated by a half-breed of</text>
  <text start="578.82" dur="5.32">angels and humans called the Nephilim</text>
  <text start="581.41" dur="6.33">right if you go to Genesis chapter 6 and</text>
  <text start="584.14" dur="6.69">read after the flood it says there were</text>
  <text start="587.74" dur="6.93">giants on the earth in the days of Noah</text>
  <text start="590.83" dur="7.11">and in the days after right and these</text>
  <text start="594.67" dur="7.5">giants that was the half-breed race of</text>
  <text start="597.94" dur="9.05">Nephilim that Satan kind of did</text>
  <text start="602.17" dur="8.22">corrupted the gene pool of humans well</text>
  <text start="606.99" dur="5.35">the one of the nations that God wanted</text>
  <text start="610.39" dur="4.5">them to wipe out the Israelites wanted</text>
  <text start="612.34" dur="6.06">to wipe out was the nation that was</text>
  <text start="614.89" dur="6.92">breeding this this half-breed race of</text>
  <text start="618.4" dur="5.55">giants all right the Philistines</text>
  <text start="621.81" dur="4">wherever the Philistines are the huge</text>
  <text start="623.95" dur="4.8">nine ten eleven twelve feet tall</text>
  <text start="625.81" dur="5.88">because they were a corrupted species it</text>
  <text start="628.75" dur="5.03">was half ain&amp;#39;t angelic species right God</text>
  <text start="631.69" dur="6.96">did not want the gene pool to be</text>
  <text start="633.78" dur="7.12">polluted by this offspring so he told</text>
  <text start="638.65" dur="3.9">the nation of Israel you need to wipe</text>
  <text start="640.9" dur="4.17">these people out because they&amp;#39;ve kind of</text>
  <text start="642.55" dur="4.74">corrupted gene pool now some people</text>
  <text start="645.07" dur="5.01">would say that&amp;#39;s just evil and horrible</text>
  <text start="647.29" dur="4.89">and wicked and how could God command his</text>
  <text start="650.08" dur="4.41">people to wipe out an entire race well</text>
  <text start="652.18" dur="5.28">that race that gene pool was polluted</text>
  <text start="654.49" dur="5.22">and God needed to destroy the work of</text>
  <text start="657.46" dur="4.95">the enemy the work of Satan so if you</text>
  <text start="659.71" dur="5.82">don&amp;#39;t think about the reasons why God</text>
  <text start="662.41" dur="4.08">might tell people to go to war and do</text>
  <text start="665.53" dur="3.66">something</text>
  <text start="666.49" dur="5.88">you can just you can falsely assume that</text>
  <text start="669.19" dur="6.48">God would have evil wicked unjust</text>
  <text start="672.37" dur="5.4">reasons for that and if you look at the</text>
  <text start="675.67" dur="5.479">larger context of Scripture and the</text>
  <text start="677.77" dur="8.15">bigger picture of what&amp;#39;s going on in the</text>
  <text start="681.149" dur="9.461">development of societies and different</text>
  <text start="685.92" dur="8.89">kingdoms the Persian Kingdom the Roman</text>
  <text start="690.61" dur="6.18">Kingdom the Greeks as these cultures are</text>
  <text start="694.81" dur="6.54">evolving and as they&amp;#39;re developing and</text>
  <text start="696.79" dur="8.16">as language is developing God is</text>
  <text start="701.35" dur="6.06">revealing himself progressively through</text>
  <text start="704.95" dur="7.56">in a more accurate way</text>
  <text start="707.41" dur="7.11">now when the Greek culture came Greeks</text>
  <text start="712.51" dur="4.17">developed a language that was much more</text>
  <text start="714.52" dur="8.189">sophisticated than any language prior to</text>
  <text start="716.68" dur="9.14">that and Jesus came at the time of the</text>
  <text start="722.709" dur="7.681">Roman occupation but after the Greek</text>
  <text start="725.82" dur="8.23">culture had provided a language and the</text>
  <text start="730.39" dur="6.15">ability to write and pass manuscripts</text>
  <text start="734.05" dur="3.779">and things in writing through large</text>
  <text start="736.54" dur="3.57">groups of people to influence the</text>
  <text start="737.829" dur="4.921">culture the culture had been prepared</text>
  <text start="740.11" dur="5.52">for God to speak through his son Jesus</text>
  <text start="742.75" dur="6.48">at the time he was born and God</text>
  <text start="745.63" dur="5.75">developed a new he announced and</text>
  <text start="749.23" dur="6.27">revealed a new covenant through his son</text>
  <text start="751.38" dur="5.47">is a covenant very much unlike the old</text>
  <text start="755.5" dur="3.3">covenant that he had established with</text>
  <text start="756.85" dur="8.4">the nascent nation of Israel right and</text>
  <text start="758.8" dur="9.09">God is continually revealing other parts</text>
  <text start="765.25" dur="6.3">of his plan his redemptive plan for</text>
  <text start="767.89" dur="5.85">mankind at various times right writer</text>
  <text start="771.55" dur="4.8">Brooke o Hebrews God who spoke at</text>
  <text start="773.74" dur="4.32">various times through the prophets has</text>
  <text start="776.35" dur="4.56">in these last days spoken through his</text>
  <text start="778.06" dur="5.31">son and that&amp;#39;s kind of an allusion to</text>
  <text start="780.91" dur="4.26">the fact that we are getting in the book</text>
  <text start="783.37" dur="3.87">of Hebrews a better covenant we have a</text>
  <text start="785.17" dur="4.44">better high priest we have a better</text>
  <text start="787.24" dur="5.4">covenant we have a better relationship</text>
  <text start="789.61" dur="7.91">with God God is always improving and</text>
  <text start="792.64" dur="6.56">upgrading his revelation to us so</text>
  <text start="797.52" dur="3.99">important</text>
  <text start="799.2" dur="8.01">backdrop behind this whole discussion of</text>
  <text start="801.51" dur="7.26">hearing God&amp;#39;s voice all right now that</text>
  <text start="807.21" dur="4.41">answer is kind of a question if God</text>

  <text start="855.17" dur="6.16">the question i would have is if you</text>
  <text start="857.85" dur="5.91">don&amp;#39;t believe God is speaking to you how</text>
  <text start="861.33" dur="6.2">do you have a relationship with God if</text>
  <text start="863.76" dur="7.68">you&amp;#39;re not communicating back and forth</text>

  <text start="888.84" dur="7.83">communicating with other kinds of</text>
  <text start="891.6" dur="8.66">spirits and and we&amp;#39;ll get into that in</text>
  <text start="896.67" dur="6.18">later chapters about how that works but</text>
  <text start="900.26" dur="6.52">many people I would say most people are</text>
  <text start="902.85" dur="6.05">having communications with spirits quite</text>
  <text start="906.78" dur="5.94">often and they&amp;#39;re not aware of it</text>
  <text start="908.9" dur="5.86">because their mind their soul is focused</text>
  <text start="912.72" dur="6.99">on the physical world not on the</text>
  <text start="914.76" dur="6.48">spiritual world so we have a</text>
  <text start="919.71" dur="4.8">relationship with God then that</text>
  <text start="921.24" dur="7.95">relationship is through the Spirit of</text>

  <text start="1632.84" dur="8.4">main topic here so I learned from Bible</text>
  <text start="1637.76" dur="9.3">teachers but there came a time effed it</text>
  <text start="1641.24" dur="8.79">was around 2007-2008 God asked me to</text>
  <text start="1647.06" dur="6.6">stop listening to the videos in the</text>
  <text start="1650.03" dur="6.6">podcast and the Bible teachers and to</text>
  <text start="1653.66" dur="8.64">sit under him personally as my</text>
  <text start="1656.63" dur="7.38">instructor and so I did I started</text>
  <text start="1662.3" dur="3.27">listening to what God was saying he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1664.01" dur="2.82">trying to give me dreams I was having</text>

  <text start="1668.18" dur="4.59">night talking and there&amp;#39;s all this</text>
  <text start="1670.46" dur="6.24">revelation coming at me it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s from</text>
  <text start="1672.77" dur="4.71">God not from Bible teachers not from</text>
  <text start="1676.7" dur="6">podcast</text>

  <text start="1684.8" dur="5.61">my mind changing my underhood view of</text>

  <text start="1704.96" dur="9.15">a writer and as things progressed and</text>
  <text start="1708.07" dur="8.77">I&amp;#39;m what I want to say is it&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1714.11" dur="4.79">saying that you should not have a pastor</text>
  <text start="1716.84" dur="5.84">or not have people that you listen to</text>
  <text start="1718.9" dur="9.52">who can teach you especially if you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1722.68" dur="8.65">new to the faith but I would say this be</text>
  <text start="1728.42" dur="6.569">sure be careful</text>
  <text start="1731.33" dur="6.75">to listen to the voice of God for you</text>

  <text start="1756.019" dur="7.551">reading the scriptures and all of that</text>
  <text start="1757.759" dur="5.811">put it all together have a well-rounded</text>
  <text start="1765.34" dur="8.169">diet of revelation from God get it from</text>

  <text start="1784.73" dur="8.309">speaks to you he&amp;#39;ll never contradict the</text>

  <text start="1793.039" dur="8.72">we&amp;#39;ve been taught that however the</text>
  <text start="1796.999" dur="8.76">Scriptures themselves say otherwise now</text>
  <text start="1801.759" dur="9.25">let me give you an example when the</text>
  <text start="1805.759" dur="9.78">Apostle Peter fell into a trance one day</text>
  <text start="1811.009" dur="5.461">as he was on the rooftop praying the</text>
  <text start="1815.539" dur="5.151">Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="1816.47" dur="8.309">said to Peter showed him a vision of</text>
  <text start="1820.69" dur="8.14">unclean animals and said Peter get up</text>
  <text start="1824.779" dur="6.03">kill and eat them right this is a Acts</text>
  <text start="1828.83" dur="7.919">chapter 10 verse 12</text>
  <text start="1830.809" dur="8.34">well Peter had been taught because Peter</text>
  <text start="1836.749" dur="5.31">knew the scriptures and in Leviticus</text>
  <text start="1839.149" dur="5.64">chapter 11 it says there&amp;#39;s God gives</text>
  <text start="1842.059" dur="5.43">instruction to the nation about which</text>
  <text start="1844.789" dur="4.411">animals they could eat and which ones</text>
  <text start="1847.489" dur="7.32">they could not which animals were</text>
  <text start="1849.2" dur="9.679">cleaned in which were unclean and Peter</text>
  <text start="1854.809" dur="6.45">said no Lord I have never eaten anything</text>
  <text start="1858.879" dur="3.43">that our Jewish laws have declared</text>
  <text start="1861.259" dur="3.391">impure or unclean</text>
  <text start="1862.309" dur="6.421">this is Acts chapter 10 verse 4</text>
  <text start="1864.65" dur="6.15">Team New Living Translation Peter Peters</text>
  <text start="1868.73" dur="3.78">position was this if God&amp;#39;s gonna speak</text>
  <text start="1870.8" dur="3.24">to me about something he is not gonna</text>
  <text start="1872.51" dur="3.27">contradict something that he has already</text>
  <text start="1874.04" dur="4.26">told us in the scriptures a long time</text>
  <text start="1875.78" dur="4.89">ago God does not contradict the</text>
  <text start="1878.3" dur="5.16">scriptures right the voice of God right</text>
  <text start="1880.67" dur="5.37">Peter was kind of saying no Lord that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1883.46" dur="5.96">that&amp;#39;s not you you wouldn&amp;#39;t tell me to</text>
  <text start="1886.04" dur="6.48">eat these unclean animals so the Lord</text>
  <text start="1889.42" dur="4.06">showed him the vision three times and</text>
  <text start="1892.52" dur="3.78">said Peter</text>
  <text start="1893.48" dur="7.02">do not call unclean that which I have</text>
  <text start="1896.3" dur="7.08">called clean right so now Peter has a</text>
  <text start="1900.5" dur="4.89">little bit of cognitive dissonance here</text>
  <text start="1903.38" dur="4.2">because he knows what the what the Old</text>
  <text start="1905.39" dur="3.81">Testament Scriptures say but he got the</text>
  <text start="1907.58" dur="4.32">voice of God is clearly showing him</text>
  <text start="1909.2" dur="4.11">something new something different and</text>
  <text start="1911.9" dur="5.33">something that contradicts what they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1913.31" dur="8.55">already been told right what do you do</text>
  <text start="1917.23" dur="6.94">so Peter as he&amp;#39;s pondering this three</text>
  <text start="1921.86" dur="4.8">men come to the door knock on the door</text>
  <text start="1924.17" dur="4.74">Holy Spirit says Peter go down as to the</text>
  <text start="1926.66" dur="4.62">door go with those men and don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1928.91" dur="5.07">question anything just follow them so</text>
  <text start="1931.28" dur="4.59">Peter they stay at his house that night</text>
  <text start="1933.98" dur="6.12">the next day he goes with them</text>
  <text start="1935.87" dur="8.28">and Peter is taken to the house of</text>
  <text start="1940.1" dur="6.87">Cornelius and he goes in and Cornelius</text>
  <text start="1944.15" dur="3.93">is a Gentile and the Jewish tradition</text>
  <text start="1946.97" dur="3.9">was they&amp;#39;re not supposed to enter the</text>
  <text start="1948.08" dur="4.53">house of a Gentile but Peter says you</text>
  <text start="1950.87" dur="5.19">know it&amp;#39;s against our laws for a Jewish</text>
  <text start="1952.61" dur="5.73">man to enter a Gentiles home like this</text>
  <text start="1956.06" dur="4.95">or to associate with you but God has</text>
  <text start="1958.34" dur="5.07">shown me that I should no longer think</text>
  <text start="1961.01" dur="5.28">of anyone as impure or unclean</text>
  <text start="1963.41" dur="5.34">now Peter took the revelation that God</text>
  <text start="1966.29" dur="4.02">gave him off unclean animals and knew</text>
  <text start="1968.75" dur="5.19">that God wasn&amp;#39;t speaking about the</text>
  <text start="1970.31" dur="6.03">animals he was speaking about people the</text>
  <text start="1973.94" dur="9">Jews considered Gentiles to be unclean</text>
  <text start="1976.34" dur="11.91">and not worthy of God&amp;#39;s favor God showed</text>
  <text start="1982.94" dur="8.64">Peter hmm no now that the good news is</text>
  <text start="1988.25" dur="3.72">for everybody Jew and Gentile alike so</text>
  <text start="1991.58" dur="2.52">Peter</text>
  <text start="1991.97" dur="4.68">testified to the miracles that God had</text>
  <text start="1994.1" dur="3.96">done he testified of Jesus the entire</text>
  <text start="1996.65" dur="5.79">house got saved they got baptized</text>
  <text start="1998.06" dur="8.31">in spirit because God was showing Peter</text>
  <text start="2002.44" dur="6.06">New Covenant new rules new revelation</text>
  <text start="2006.37" dur="4.2">forget what I said a thousand years ago</text>
  <text start="2008.5" dur="4.47">we&amp;#39;re changing the plan here a little</text>
  <text start="2010.57" dur="9.06">hint all right and all of that is to</text>
  <text start="2012.97" dur="11.07">illustrate the point that sometimes God</text>
  <text start="2019.63" dur="5.58">won&amp;#39;t necessarily contradict what he</text>
  <text start="2024.04" dur="5.04">said in the scriptures but he will</text>
  <text start="2025.21" dur="7.05">update or give you a new revelation a</text>
  <text start="2029.08" dur="5.04">new understanding of his heart his mercy</text>
  <text start="2032.26" dur="4.23">his love for people and that&amp;#39;s there</text>
  <text start="2034.12" dur="7.32">that&amp;#39;s the thing look God is a God of</text>
  <text start="2036.49" dur="7.26">light life and love and if God tells you</text>
  <text start="2041.44" dur="5.88">something and it is inconsistent with</text>
  <text start="2043.75" dur="6.45">the light of God the love of God and if</text>
  <text start="2047.32" dur="6.05">it is inconsistent with his heart then</text>
  <text start="2050.2" dur="7.53">you could you&amp;#39;re free to ignore it</text>
  <text start="2053.37" dur="8.83">God doesn&amp;#39;t contradict his nature his</text>
  <text start="2057.73" dur="8.73">nature is love God is love he is light</text>
  <text start="2062.2" dur="6.45">and he is the giver of life so if it is</text>
  <text start="2066.46" dur="3.98">going to produce and that&amp;#39;s the way you</text>
  <text start="2068.65" dur="9.44">can measure the fruit of the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="2070.44" dur="12.58">if some revelation produces love if it</text>
  <text start="2078.09" dur="7.03">gives life it is from God it can&amp;#39;t be</text>
  <text start="2083.02" dur="3.81">any it can&amp;#39;t come from her there any</text>
  <text start="2085.12" dur="5.12">other source he is the source of love</text>
  <text start="2086.83" dur="7.53">he&amp;#39;s the source of light and even though</text>
  <text start="2090.24" dur="8.32">Satan can present himself as an angel of</text>
  <text start="2094.36" dur="9.12">light the fruit if you are listening to</text>
  <text start="2098.56" dur="8.4">the voice of demons fallen angels it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2103.48" dur="4.77">going to produce fruit of darkness if</text>

  <text start="2118.05" dur="4.27">all right</text>
  <text start="2119.52" dur="5.11">another myth and misconception it is too</text>
  <text start="2122.32" dur="3.09">easy to be deceived by voices that are</text>
  <text start="2124.63" dur="3.3">not gods</text>
  <text start="2125.41" dur="5.34">boy isn&amp;#39;t that true all right so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2127.93" dur="5.51">an objection that a lot of people have</text>
  <text start="2130.75" dur="6.45">because you know you don&amp;#39;t have to be</text>
  <text start="2133.44" dur="7.21">too savvy to understand that there are</text>

  <text start="2150.64" dur="7.41">they&amp;#39;re hearing the voice of God and</text>
  <text start="2152.26" dur="7.8">they are absolutely hearing demons and</text>
  <text start="2158.05" dur="5.43">that gets to be a little bit of fun</text>
  <text start="2160.06" dur="6.09">although people who are like severely</text>
