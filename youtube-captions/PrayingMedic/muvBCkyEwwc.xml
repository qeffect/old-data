  <text start="43.1" dur="4.689">my question is how are they going to</text>
  <text start="45.329" dur="4.441">spin the Harvey Weinstein scandal and</text>
  <text start="47.789" dur="3.66">all the pedophiles that have been outed</text>
  <text start="49.77" dur="2.879">over the last few months are they going</text>
  <text start="51.449" dur="3.901">to mention it is that going to be</text>
  <text start="52.649" dur="6.18">something they don&amp;#39;t talk about it&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="55.35" dur="8.269">interesting to see how the Hollywood</text>
  <text start="58.829" dur="7.051">people cover their tracks on all of this</text>
  <text start="63.619" dur="7.271">do you think they know this storm is</text>
  <text start="65.88" dur="6.84">here hey Daniel how&amp;#39;s it going do you</text>
  <text start="70.89" dur="7.38">think that they know this storm is here</text>
  <text start="72.72" dur="7.2">I guess we&amp;#39;ll find that someone is</text>
  <text start="78.27" dur="6.599">saying that the fake news Awards have</text>
  <text start="79.92" dur="7.019">been delayed until the 17th ok he</text>

  <text start="89.49" dur="4.32">time to figure out where he&amp;#39;s gonna be</text>
  <text start="91.32" dur="5.31">broadcasting this from cuz I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="93.81" dur="6.809">a whole lot about it so 17 all right</text>
  <text start="96.63" dur="8.279">cool have you noticed that none of the</text>
  <text start="100.619" dur="6.691">president&amp;#39;s enemies in Congress have</text>
  <text start="104.909" dur="5.131">been talking about the scandal with</text>
  <text start="107.31" dur="5.22">Steve Bannon so you have this book fire</text>
  <text start="110.04" dur="4.289">and fury comes out Bannon allegedly says</text>
  <text start="112.53" dur="4.47">all this stuff Trump is mentally</text>
  <text start="114.329" dur="4.951">incompetent almost you know stuff have</text>
  <text start="117" dur="5.009">you noticed that Elizabeth Warren Nancy</text>
  <text start="119.28" dur="4.86">Pelosi Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris all</text>
  <text start="122.009" dur="3.991">of the enemies of the president none of</text>
  <text start="124.14" dur="7.41">them are talking about this not one of</text>
  <text start="126" dur="7.86">them I find that very interesting that</text>
  <text start="131.55" dur="6.72">trumps adversaries in Congress</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="7.52">they&amp;#39;re not saying anything about it do</text>
  <text start="138.27" dur="5.46">you think they know the storm is here</text>
  <text start="141.38" dur="5.26">because the only thing they&amp;#39;re talking</text>
  <text start="143.73" dur="5.82">about is Dhaka that is it they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="146.64" dur="4.65">talking about Dhaka and no wall and we</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="2.94">got to have Dhaka and we don&amp;#39;t want to</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="2.82">shut down the government but if you</text>
  <text start="152.49" dur="2.82">don&amp;#39;t give us Dhaka we&amp;#39;re gonna shut</text>
  <text start="154.11" dur="3.84">down the government that&amp;#39;s all they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="155.31" dur="6.06">talking about they don&amp;#39;t go near this</text>
  <text start="157.95" dur="6.78">vannin thing with this book they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="161.37" dur="6.15">touching it I think that the people in</text>
  <text start="164.73" dur="5.19">Congress know this is a trap the Bandon</text>
  <text start="167.52" dur="6.81">thing and I think they know it&amp;#39;s a trap</text>
  <text start="169.92" dur="6.96">they see it and the question I have is</text>
  <text start="174.33" dur="6.48">do you think the people in Congress go</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="6.72">to bed at night and pray that they are</text>
  <text start="180.81" dur="7.71">not the next one to be exposed for</text>
  <text start="183.6" dur="7.68">corruption or sexual misconduct that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="188.52" dur="4.35">what I wonder because when I look at</text>
  <text start="191.28" dur="6.33">people in Congress I see a whole lot of</text>
  <text start="192.87" dur="6.48">people who are afraid of Trump they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="197.61" dur="3.75">afraid they don&amp;#39;t want to be the next</text>
  <text start="199.35" dur="3.21">ones outed they don&amp;#39;t want to be the</text>
  <text start="201.36" dur="2.49">next ones when they wake up in the</text>
  <text start="202.56" dur="4.429">morning their name is all over the</text>
  <text start="203.85" dur="7.77">newspapers about scandal I think</text>
  <text start="206.989" dur="8.951">Congress is terrified we have as much as</text>
  <text start="211.62" dur="7.35">heard that coming from the hill in the</text>
  <text start="215.94" dur="4.17">last few weeks if people in Congress are</text>
  <text start="218.97" dur="4.29">terrified they want to know who&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="220.11" dur="4.71">be next so I find it very interesting</text>
  <text start="223.26" dur="3.03">that Congress does get a lot of</text>
  <text start="224.82" dur="4.65">especially nevertrump errs like Lindsey</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="5.4">Graham front and center on the Trump</text>
  <text start="229.47" dur="3.39">train they are taking their step behind</text>
  <text start="231.69" dur="3.269">the president they know he&amp;#39;s got the</text>
  <text start="232.86" dur="5.099">wind at his back they&amp;#39;re seeing his</text>
  <text start="234.959" dur="5.911">victories they gave it a year they gave</text>
  <text start="237.959" dur="4.471">this Trump let&amp;#39;s impeach Trump let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="240.87" dur="3.54">rid of Trump they gave it a year it</text>
  <text start="242.43" dur="4.589">didn&amp;#39;t work and I think now they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="244.41" dur="4.38">getting hip to the fact that it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="247.019" dur="3.78">going to work Trump isn&amp;#39;t going to be</text>
  <text start="248.79" dur="3.96">impeached that Moeller isn&amp;#39;t gonna find</text>
  <text start="250.799" dur="3.451">anything on Trump and they&amp;#39;re gonna have</text>
  <text start="252.75" dur="6.15">to live with Trump for the next four</text>
  <text start="254.25" dur="7.669">years probably seven years and so the</text>
  <text start="258.9" dur="5.22">ones who are smart have switched and</text>
  <text start="261.919" dur="3.221">they are now on the Trump train and</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="2.669">they&amp;#39;re just going along for the ride</text>
  <text start="265.14" dur="2.52">because they know Trump is going to get</text>
  <text start="266.789" dur="2.401">a lot of things done</text>
  <text start="267.66" dur="3.57">and they want to be part of that you can</text>
  <text start="269.19" dur="3.33">see you can see Paul Ryan you can see</text>
  <text start="271.23" dur="2.43">Mitch McConnell II can see Lindsey</text>
  <text start="272.52" dur="5.94">Graham all these people who are never</text>
  <text start="273.66" dur="6.45">Trump errs they&amp;#39;re all just gushing with</text>
  <text start="278.46" dur="3.56">praise for the president if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="280.11" dur="5.19">smart because they know he&amp;#39;s gonna win</text>
  <text start="282.02" dur="4.96">so I look at those people and I say yeah</text>
  <text start="285.3" dur="4.02">they&amp;#39;ve they figure it out they know the</text>
  <text start="286.98" dur="10.08">storms here and they&amp;#39;re trying to not be</text>
  <text start="289.32" dur="11.24">left out in the storm so I have a little</text>
  <text start="297.06" dur="9.42">bit of unfinished business from</text>
  <text start="300.56" dur="8.38">yesterday so in yesterday&amp;#39;s broadcast we</text>
  <text start="306.48" dur="4.67">talked about Admiral Rogers and I</text>
  <text start="308.94" dur="6.41">mentioned that it was likely the</text>
  <text start="311.15" dur="7.12">unmasking of the Trump transition team</text>
  <text start="315.35" dur="5.05">members that was found in the</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="7.53">presidential daily briefing by Devin</text>
  <text start="320.4" dur="10.68">Nunez that caused him to investigate the</text>
  <text start="325.8" dur="12.21">origin of the surveillance the the FISA</text>
  <text start="331.08" dur="9.39">warrant and the steal dossier okay it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="338.01" dur="5.37">likely that Nunez went into that skiff</text>
  <text start="340.47" dur="4.56">saw presidential daily briefing saw the</text>
  <text start="343.38" dur="3.69">people on the Trump transition team were</text>
  <text start="345.03" dur="5.639">unmasked and that&amp;#39;s what made him turn</text>
  <text start="347.07" dur="6">into Keyser söze okay so here&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="350.669" dur="4.441">question did you know that Devin Nunez</text>
  <text start="353.07" dur="12.03">was a member of the Trump transition</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="13.26">team yes Devin Nunez was a member of the</text>
  <text start="365.1" dur="6.03">Trump transition team this is a fact</text>
  <text start="368.37" dur="5.82">that was brought to my attention by my</text>
  <text start="371.13" dur="4.32">friend King bro Lee Travis on Twitter he</text>
  <text start="374.19" dur="4.38">sends me a message this morning he was</text>
  <text start="375.45" dur="4.8">hey your broadcast on Admiral Rogers is</text>
  <text start="378.57" dur="3.39">really good but you missed one point did</text>
  <text start="380.25" dur="3.9">you know Devin Nunez was on the trunk</text>
  <text start="381.96" dur="4.56">transition team I was like what he was</text>
  <text start="384.15" dur="4.83">so I went to this website it&amp;#39;s called</text>
  <text start="386.52" dur="6.08">Nunez house.gov</text>
  <text start="388.98" dur="6.66">news and there&amp;#39;s a press release</text>
  <text start="392.6" dur="4.87">congressman Devin Nunez released the</text>
  <text start="395.64" dur="3.72">following statement today after joining</text>
  <text start="397.47" dur="3.62">the Executive Committee of Donald</text>
  <text start="399.36" dur="3.68">Trump&amp;#39;s transition team</text>
  <text start="401.09" dur="3.63">today I was honored to have been named</text>
  <text start="403.04" dur="3.33">to the Executive Committee of</text>
  <text start="404.72" dur="3.72">president-elect Donald Trump&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="406.37" dur="3.63">transition team in this role I will</text>
  <text start="408.44" dur="3.78">advise president-elect Trump on the</text>
  <text start="410" dur="3.84">appointments of his cabinet members and</text>
  <text start="412.22" dur="4.05">on the appointments of other top</text>
  <text start="413.84" dur="5.01">positions in the new administration I</text>
  <text start="416.27" dur="6.23">look forward to helping to assemble an</text>
  <text start="418.85" dur="7.34">energetic team and it just goes on so</text>
  <text start="422.5" dur="7.09">Nunez was on Trump&amp;#39;s transition team and</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="5.35">it&amp;#39;s likely that in the presidential</text>
  <text start="429.59" dur="5.52">daily briefing that he saw in the skiff</text>
  <text start="431.54" dur="6.21">he saw his own text messages his own</text>
  <text start="435.11" dur="5.49">phone calls in his own emails unmasked</text>
  <text start="437.75" dur="5.34">and given to all these people in Obama&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.6" dur="4.89">staff his own information private</text>
  <text start="443.09" dur="4.74">information was showing up in the</text>
  <text start="445.49" dur="5.19">presidential daily briefing and I would</text>
  <text start="447.83" dur="5.22">imagine that is why Nunez came out of</text>
  <text start="450.68" dur="5.31">that skiff looking like he swallowed a</text>
  <text start="453.05" dur="4.92">cat because he saw his own private</text>
  <text start="455.99" dur="9.299">information showing up in the</text>
  <text start="457.97" dur="10.05">presidential daily briefing yes Devin</text>
  <text start="465.289" dur="7.921">Nunez was part of the Trump transition</text>
  <text start="468.02" dur="8.94">team so that is why Devin Nunez has</text>
  <text start="473.21" dur="6.66">turned into Keyser söze because he now</text>
  <text start="476.96" dur="3.78">has this is personal for him this is</text>
  <text start="479.87" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s personal</text>
  <text start="480.74" dur="5.67">he had to be so outraged when he saw</text>
  <text start="484.22" dur="4.47">probably saw his own information in the</text>
  <text start="486.41" dur="5.129">presidential daily briefing unmasked he</text>
  <text start="488.69" dur="4.88">prejudice lost it and I would if I was</text>
  <text start="491.539" dur="5.971">in his position I would have lost it too</text>
  <text start="493.57" dur="6.73">so just throwing that out there for you</text>
  <text start="497.51" dur="11.94">a little extra information to think</text>
  <text start="500.3" dur="13.83">about all right so my threat today that</text>
  <text start="509.45" dur="8.13">I&amp;#39;m going to go through is a thread by a</text>
  <text start="514.13" dur="10.14">guy named Trump soldier on Twitter his</text>
  <text start="517.58" dur="12.23">handle is at Dave and why viii it&amp;#39;s at</text>
  <text start="524.27" dur="8.069">Dave and why like New York viii</text>
  <text start="529.81" dur="4.55">I&amp;#39;ve been following him for a while he</text>
  <text start="532.339" dur="6.521">and Sundance do some of the best</text>
  <text start="534.36" dur="6">threads on Twitter as far as looking at</text>
  <text start="538.86" dur="3.84">what&amp;#39;s going on the inspector general</text>
  <text start="540.36" dur="5.58">the all the house intelligence</text>
  <text start="542.7" dur="6.389">committees these all these meetings that</text>
  <text start="545.94" dur="5.49">are going on these guys are making sense</text>
  <text start="549.089" dur="4.801">of all of this stuff and they&amp;#39;re giving</text>
  <text start="551.43" dur="5.64">it us an idea where it&amp;#39;s all going</text>
  <text start="553.89" dur="4.41">they&amp;#39;re forecasting the direction this</text>
  <text start="557.07" dur="3.15">is going in and let me tell you I had a</text>
  <text start="558.3" dur="4.2">dream last night by the way so the same</text>
  <text start="560.22" dur="7.049">with the dream in the dream and it was a</text>
  <text start="562.5" dur="7.019">symbolic dream it had to do with the</text>
  <text start="567.269" dur="4.141">intelligence community and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="569.519" dur="4.56">an answer to a question a lot of you</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="5.85">have when we talked about Admiral Rogers</text>
  <text start="574.079" dur="4.921">stepping down from his position as head</text>
  <text start="577.26" dur="2.28">of NSA a lot of people are concerned oh</text>
  <text start="579" dur="2.43">great</text>
  <text start="579.54" dur="4.799">we you know we got this one guy this</text>
  <text start="581.43" dur="4.71">white hat Rogers and now he&amp;#39;s gonna step</text>
  <text start="584.339" dur="3.93">down who&amp;#39;s gonna take over NSA we have</text>
  <text start="586.14" dur="3.75">to find someone we can trust and we</text>
  <text start="588.269" dur="2.671">don&amp;#39;t want to put somebody in there</text>
  <text start="589.89" dur="4.74">who&amp;#39;s gonna have problems</text>
  <text start="590.94" dur="7.41">so people are concerned about what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="594.63" dur="8.79">gonna happen with Mike Rogers stepping</text>
  <text start="598.35" dur="7.169">down in the dream I saw a symbolic</text>
  <text start="603.42" dur="4.409">representation of the intelligence</text>
  <text start="605.519" dur="4.621">community and I saw a bunch of people</text>
  <text start="607.829" dur="5.521">who were concerned that they were going</text>
  <text start="610.14" dur="4.8">to be people missing from their</text>
  <text start="613.35" dur="3.59">positions in the intelligence community</text>
  <text start="614.94" dur="4.86">and that was going to cause a problem</text>
  <text start="616.94" dur="7.45">and that&amp;#39;s what I saw in the dream then</text>
  <text start="619.8" dur="7.26">I saw that this perceived problem wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="624.39" dur="5.16">that as much a problem as people thought</text>
  <text start="627.06" dur="6.269">it was it was only a perceived problem</text>
  <text start="629.55" dur="6.63">it was easily remedied by putting a few</text>
  <text start="633.329" dur="5.791">people in some key places and adding</text>
  <text start="636.18" dur="5.43">some additional resources for those</text>
  <text start="639.12" dur="6.3">people to work with once that was done</text>
  <text start="641.61" dur="8.46">no more problems it was easy so I think</text>
  <text start="645.42" dur="6.18">the dream represents the idea that we</text>
  <text start="650.07" dur="2.759">have concerns about the intelligence</text>
  <text start="651.6" dur="2.489">community we don&amp;#39;t need to be concerned</text>
  <text start="652.829" dur="5.491">about it it&amp;#39;s gonna be fine</text>
  <text start="654.089" dur="6.99">that God has a plan and that Trump has a</text>
  <text start="658.32" dur="4.98">plan and the necessary people and</text>
  <text start="661.079" dur="5.041">resources will be allocated and we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="663.3" dur="4.95">have to worry about it so don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="666.12" dur="4.29">it&amp;#39;s all good I think</text>
  <text start="668.25" dur="8.72">everything&amp;#39;s gonna be fine so let&amp;#39;s get</text>
  <text start="670.41" dur="10.11">on to Trump soldiers thread the first</text>

  <text start="680.52" dur="3.81">the Inspector General report and the</text>
  <text start="682.38" dur="4.14">inevitable march toward a special</text>

  <text start="686.52" dur="6.21">Justice and I might as well say this up</text>
  <text start="688.56" dur="7.05">front if there is corruption inside the</text>
  <text start="692.73" dur="5.34">Department of Justice and the FBI it</text>
  <text start="695.61" dur="4.38">seems rather obvious that you can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="698.07" dur="4.5">trust the Department of Justice to</text>
  <text start="699.99" dur="5.16">investigate itself that you would have</text>
  <text start="702.57" dur="4.86">to appoint a special counsel who is</text>

  <text start="712.17" dur="5.16">objectively no one would take it</text>
  <text start="714.18" dur="7.65">seriously so if there is corruption and</text>
  <text start="717.33" dur="8.07">malfeasance inside the DOJ and the FBI</text>
  <text start="721.83" dur="5.43">you have to have a special counsel who</text>
  <text start="725.4" dur="3.78">is outside of that system who can</text>
  <text start="727.26" dur="4.26">investigate I mean that just makes sense</text>
  <text start="729.18" dur="6.45">right and that is where this is all</text>
  <text start="731.52" dur="6.63">going and we&amp;#39;re gonna explain why we</text>
  <text start="735.63" dur="4.29">know that to be the case and how all of</text>
  <text start="738.15" dur="3.57">the documents that have come out in the</text>

  <text start="842.89" dur="7.19">think I might read it let me see and it</text>
  <text start="848.77" dur="5.34">has two parts</text>
  <text start="850.08" dur="7.66">the review will not substitute the OIG s</text>

  <text start="865.8" dur="7.78">circumstances warrant the OIG will</text>

  <text start="873.58" dur="8.09">arise during the course of the review in</text>
  <text start="878.22" dur="6.94">the inspector general Horowitz&amp;#39;s War</text>
  <text start="881.67" dur="7.96">versus the Obama administration he</text>
  <text start="885.16" dur="8.22">allied himself with Congress we learned</text>
  <text start="889.63" dur="5.55">yesterday from Sundance&amp;#39;s report that</text>
  <text start="893.38" dur="5.7">the goal of the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="895.18" dur="8.58">under President Obama was to operate</text>
  <text start="899.08" dur="7.38">without oversight that was their goal</text>
  <text start="903.76" dur="5.82">when Sally Yates sent back that letter</text>
  <text start="906.46" dur="6.48">to Horowitz when Horowitz was asking for</text>
  <text start="909.58" dur="5.58">documents and information concerning the</text>
  <text start="912.94" dur="4.29">division of national security</text>
  <text start="915.16" dur="3.51">Sally AIT&amp;#39;s pretty much said we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="917.23" dur="3.27">subject to your oversight you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="918.67" dur="3.72">getting our documents they wanted to</text>
  <text start="920.5" dur="5.49">operate without oversight all right we</text>
  <text start="922.39" dur="5.67">know that so knowing that you have a</text>
  <text start="925.99" dur="3.9">rogue department that wants to operate</text>
  <text start="928.06" dur="5.61">without oversight and they fear Congress</text>
  <text start="929.89" dur="5.41">and your House Judiciary House or Senate</text>
  <text start="933.67" dur="6.15">Intel committee what is your</text>
  <text start="935.3" dur="6.9">job your job is oversight you have to be</text>
  <text start="939.82" dur="4.42">hold these people accountable you&amp;#39;re how</text>
  <text start="942.2" dur="4.02">you&amp;#39;re responsible not just for funding</text>
  <text start="944.24" dur="3.39">but you&amp;#39;re also responsible for</text>
  <text start="946.22" dur="5.28">oversight and make sure that they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="947.63" dur="6.63">go off the rails and so you know that</text>
  <text start="951.5" dur="4.32">Congress wanted to have oversight over</text>
  <text start="954.26" dur="3.62">the Department of Justice and Department</text>
  <text start="955.82" dur="4.65">of Justice was fighting it all the way</text>
  <text start="957.88" dur="5.199">actually President Obama and Eric Holder</text>
  <text start="960.47" dur="5.34">fought this thing for years to make sure</text>
  <text start="963.079" dur="6.721">that Congress didn&amp;#39;t have oversight over</text>
  <text start="965.81" dur="5.85">the DOJ and that the Inspector General</text>
  <text start="969.8" dur="5.46">would not have access to their documents</text>
  <text start="971.66" dur="6.89">and this war it has been going on for</text>
  <text start="975.26" dur="6.8">years it finally got settled last year</text>
  <text start="978.55" dur="6.9">not 2017 2016 right after the election</text>
  <text start="982.06" dur="5.88">we&amp;#39;ll talk more about that in a minute</text>
  <text start="985.45" dur="5.29">so this is a continuation of the war</text>
  <text start="987.94" dur="5.47">this is essentially a mop-up operation</text>
  <text start="990.74" dur="5.49">the endgame is to appoint a special</text>
  <text start="993.41" dur="5.19">counsel and there are two paths to get</text>
  <text start="996.23" dur="5.549">there both paths go through the</text>
  <text start="998.6" dur="5.94">Department of Justice DOJ can appoint a</text>
  <text start="1001.779" dur="6.451">special counsel on their own or they can</text>
  <text start="1004.54" dur="5.45">be forced to appoint one by Congress the</text>
  <text start="1008.23" dur="5.88">evidence is going to be too overwhelming</text>
  <text start="1009.99" dur="7.18">to do anything else it will look like</text>
  <text start="1014.11" dur="6.419">the Inspector General and Congress are</text>
  <text start="1017.17" dur="6.39">in a battle against the Department of</text>
  <text start="1020.529" dur="4.321">Justice but that&amp;#39;s only the perception</text>
  <text start="1023.56" dur="2.999">and you see a lot of people that are</text>
  <text start="1024.85" dur="4.859">kind of tweeting and writing about that</text>
  <text start="1026.559" dur="6.51">now they it appears as though David</text>
  <text start="1029.709" dur="5.401">Nunez has a lot of hostility toward rod</text>
  <text start="1033.069" dur="4.971">Rosenstein and Jeff Sessions and a lot</text>
  <text start="1035.11" dur="7.74">of people conservative commentators are</text>
  <text start="1038.04" dur="7.419">fooled by that appearance and they think</text>
  <text start="1042.85" dur="4.14">sessions has to resign Rosen Stein has</text>
  <text start="1045.459" dur="3.361">to resign we have to fire these people</text>
  <text start="1046.99" dur="3.66">because they&amp;#39;re obstructing and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1048.82" dur="4.44">not cooperating with Congress and what</text>
  <text start="1050.65" dur="4.8">needs to be done that is only an</text>
  <text start="1053.26" dur="6.24">appearance it is not what&amp;#39;s actually</text>
  <text start="1055.45" dur="7.71">happening and if you read between the</text>
  <text start="1059.5" dur="5.76">lines you can see that sessions and</text>
  <text start="1063.16" dur="3.87">Rosen Stein their hands are tied until</text>
  <text start="1065.26" dur="3.93">this Inspector General report comes out</text>
  <text start="1067.03" dur="4.59">and tell that IG report comes out</text>
  <text start="1069.19" dur="5.18">they can&amp;#39;t do anything they really can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1071.62" dur="8.34">what they finally did the other night</text>
  <text start="1074.37" dur="7.51">was Rosenstein and Ray agreed to give</text>
  <text start="1079.96" dur="6.54">Devon union&amp;#39;s access to the witnesses</text>
  <text start="1081.88" dur="6">and the documents you requested but it</text>
  <text start="1086.5" dur="8.67">has to all be done in a certain way</text>
