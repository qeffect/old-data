  <text start="91.66" dur="4.47">difficult thing for you um well in the</text>
  <text start="93.91" dur="3.96">past it was difficult but I mean he was</text>
  <text start="96.13" dur="3.54">with me every step like right now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="97.87" dur="4.44">just like I feel like I have this</text>
  <text start="99.67" dur="4.59">different perspective and I&amp;#39;m kind of</text>
  <text start="102.31" dur="3.87">thinking I mean I haven&amp;#39;t heard too much</text>
  <text start="104.26" dur="3.51">of it being talked about from the</text>
  <text start="106.18" dur="4.56">perspective that I can kind of relate to</text>
  <text start="107.77" dur="4.08">so I was just kind of thinking maybe I</text>
  <text start="110.74" dur="3.54">could just kind of put it out there I</text>
  <text start="111.85" dur="4.77">guess I&amp;#39;m sure that you&amp;#39;ve probably</text>
  <text start="114.28" dur="4.23">heard a lot of different conversations</text>
  <text start="116.62" dur="3.6">people who have different views and</text>
  <text start="118.51" dur="4.29">perspectives but you have your own and</text>
  <text start="120.22" dur="6">it&amp;#39;s probably unique and I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="122.8" dur="6.329">worth hearing so you and I met through a</text>
  <text start="126.22" dur="5.04">mutual friend and you had posted your</text>
  <text start="129.129" dur="4.711">testimony for your friends and family</text>
  <text start="131.26" dur="4.71">can you briefly talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="133.84" dur="5.19">what prompted you to write that well</text>
  <text start="135.97" dur="4.83">what prompted me was I&amp;#39;ve got Christian</text>
  <text start="139.03" dur="3.72">friends and I&amp;#39;ve got atheist friends and</text>
  <text start="140.8" dur="3.45">you know everybody&amp;#39;s got their viewpoint</text>
  <text start="142.75" dur="4.2">whatever label you want to put on it</text>
  <text start="144.25" dur="4.709">liberal conservative there&amp;#39;s extremes</text>
  <text start="146.95" dur="2.94">flying in my face on my newsfeed every</text>
  <text start="148.959" dur="3.061">day</text>
  <text start="149.89" dur="4.11">I was just thinking just you can&amp;#39;t we</text>
  <text start="152.02" dur="3.96">can&amp;#39;t get past the political talk points</text>
  <text start="154" dur="4.77">and we&amp;#39;re putting labels on people and</text>
  <text start="155.98" dur="5.13">people are so much more complex and the</text>
  <text start="158.77" dur="4.74">simple labels that we become so used to</text>
  <text start="161.11" dur="3.959">I mean those political parties they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="163.51" dur="4.14">just trying to get votes and stuff</text>
  <text start="165.069" dur="4.531">they&amp;#39;re not taking time to give every</text>
  <text start="167.65" dur="3.87">single individual the dignity that we</text>
  <text start="169.6" dur="4.89">each deserve no matter what label you</text>
  <text start="171.52" dur="5.189">think somebody is there this person and</text>
  <text start="174.49" dur="4.53">underneath that has the same dreams and</text>
  <text start="176.709" dur="4.891">hopes and fears that you do they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="179.02" dur="5.64">just this simple little issue but anyway</text>
  <text start="181.6" dur="5.7">the story was when I was growing up I</text>
  <text start="184.66" dur="5.31">was raised christian and when i first</text>
  <text start="187.3" dur="5.34">started becoming aware of others</text>
  <text start="189.97" dur="5.64">sexually I guess you could say I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="5.849">really ever feel attracted to boys I</text>
  <text start="195.61" dur="4.8">always was really drawn to girls and</text>
  <text start="198.489" dur="3.511">when I guess when I realized what that</text>
  <text start="200.41" dur="3.66">was I guess I felt really really guilty</text>
  <text start="202" dur="4.65">and you know cuz oh you don&amp;#39;t do that</text>
  <text start="204.07" dur="4.32">and so I tried you know to be a good</text>
  <text start="206.65" dur="3.69">little Christian girl and I mean I was</text>
  <text start="208.39" dur="4.02">too young to really understand all the</text>
  <text start="210.34" dur="3.119">complexities of that anyway but you know</text>
  <text start="212.41" dur="3.6">and then when I was a teenager I was</text>
  <text start="213.459" dur="5.431">rebelling and I just kind of pursued my</text>
  <text start="216.01" dur="6">own my wants with that and did your</text>
  <text start="218.89" dur="6.12">parents know about your feeling towards</text>
  <text start="222.01" dur="5.789">women oh heck no okay so they didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="225.01" dur="4.89">know no I wasn&amp;#39;t like open about</text>
  <text start="227.799" dur="3.631">anything with them I was very angry at</text>
  <text start="229.9" dur="4.44">them for a lot of things so they weren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="231.43" dur="5.54">really included in much that happened</text>
  <text start="234.34" dur="4.89">with my life I mean my mom to an extent</text>
  <text start="236.97" dur="4.78">you know I shared some things with her</text>
  <text start="239.23" dur="4.74">but not about that and I don&amp;#39;t know it</text>
  <text start="241.75" dur="6">was just a really really crazy time I</text>
  <text start="243.97" dur="5.43">can imagine it was a crazy time so did</text>
  <text start="247.75" dur="3.9">you feel like there would be any value</text>
  <text start="249.4" dur="4.23">for you in seeking counseling about this</text>
  <text start="251.65" dur="3.41">or did you just keep it all internal and</text>
  <text start="253.63" dur="5.099">you didn&amp;#39;t talk to anyone about it I</text>
  <text start="255.06" dur="6.519">wasn&amp;#39;t really seeking God at that point</text>
  <text start="258.729" dur="4.621">in my life as far as I was aware in</text>
  <text start="261.579" dur="3.721">concerned you know as far as my limited</text>
  <text start="263.35" dur="3.48">perspective he had let me down a lot and</text>
  <text start="265.3" dur="4.32">there was stuff going on with my family</text>
  <text start="266.83" dur="4.709">and my mom my parents marriage and I was</text>
  <text start="269.62" dur="4.859">just not interested in talking to him or</text>
  <text start="271.539" dur="4.711">anybody to do with him at all so I left</text>
  <text start="274.479" dur="4.141">home as soon as I graduated and I moved</text>
  <text start="276.25" dur="3.84">down to Florida and I had relationships</text>
  <text start="278.62" dur="3.47">down there because it&amp;#39;s a lot more I</text>
  <text start="280.09" dur="3.72">guess gay-friendly you could say and</text>
  <text start="282.09" dur="4.329">there&amp;#39;s more mainstream</text>
  <text start="283.81" dur="4.26">accepted okay with the people in your</text>
  <text start="286.419" dur="5.491">circle of friends did they get to know</text>
  <text start="288.07" dur="5.61">you as as a lesbian well the thing is</text>
  <text start="291.91" dur="4.47">the this whole like coming out of the</text>
  <text start="293.68" dur="5.07">closet thing like I never really felt</text>
  <text start="296.38" dur="4.77">that that was my main identity it was</text>
  <text start="298.75" dur="3.87">just something I wanted to do and people</text>
  <text start="301.15" dur="4.44">the people that I was attracted to</text>
  <text start="302.62" dur="5.07">that&amp;#39;s just what I pursued I didn&amp;#39;t wear</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="4.92">a rainbow flag on my shirt or you know</text>
  <text start="307.69" dur="4.41">do my hair in a certain way on purpose</text>
  <text start="310.51" dur="3.06">to show that I mean I shaved my head</text>
  <text start="312.1" dur="3.51">before but not because I was wanting</text>
  <text start="313.57" dur="4.23">everybody to know I was a lesbian you</text>
  <text start="315.61" dur="3.9">know I mean and so imma lived my life I</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="4.35">wasn&amp;#39;t trying to prove myself to anybody</text>
  <text start="319.51" dur="5.07">so you weren&amp;#39;t really active in like the</text>
  <text start="322.15" dur="3.87">LGBT community or anything like that not</text>
  <text start="324.58" dur="2.85">really I was just living my little</text>
  <text start="326.02" dur="5.01">selfish life doing what I felt like</text>
  <text start="327.43" dur="6.36">doing gotcha and was the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="331.03" dur="4.56">speaking to you during that time or were</text>
  <text start="333.79" dur="3.599">you just trying not to hear anything</text>
  <text start="335.59" dur="3.75">from God and still being sort of angry</text>
  <text start="337.389" dur="5.401">towards him all the funny thing about</text>
  <text start="339.34" dur="5.73">God and not really funny but awesome was</text>
  <text start="342.79" dur="5.76">I was not trying to hear him whatsoever</text>
  <text start="345.07" dur="6.09">I was angry at him and I actually would</text>
  <text start="348.55" dur="4.26">speak really really harshly and be</text>
  <text start="351.16" dur="4.08">really argumentative towards Christians</text>
  <text start="352.81" dur="3.93">and anytime anything Christian subject</text>
  <text start="355.24" dur="4.049">came up I was always trying to argue</text>
  <text start="356.74" dur="5.01">against it I just had these anger issues</text>
  <text start="359.289" dur="5.581">but like I throughout this time from</text>
  <text start="361.75" dur="5.31">like 1995 to like 2005 just like</text>
  <text start="364.87" dur="4.859">straight solid ten-year block in my life</text>
  <text start="367.06" dur="5.49">I can look back and I can see where he</text>
  <text start="369.729" dur="5.131">reached out to me and he like put little</text>
  <text start="372.55" dur="4.08">things in my path where I looked up at</text>
  <text start="374.86" dur="3.42">the sky I was like I know that&amp;#39;s you God</text>
  <text start="376.63" dur="5.49">we still mad at you though I feel like</text>
  <text start="378.28" dur="8.04">but I look back at it and I&amp;#39;m like he is</text>
  <text start="382.12" dur="7.049">so loving and just so faithful and even</text>
  <text start="386.32" dur="5.34">though I was so rebellious and you know</text>
  <text start="389.169" dur="4.201">being so hateful towards him and the</text>
  <text start="391.66" dur="3.81">people that professed you know openly</text>
  <text start="393.37" dur="4.049">that they you know followed him he was</text>
  <text start="395.47" dur="4.919">still reaching out to me and drawing me</text>
  <text start="397.419" dur="5.22">back to him and those things later they</text>
  <text start="400.389" dur="5.071">became things that you know are precious</text>
  <text start="402.639" dur="5.551">memories to me now and prove how much he</text>
  <text start="405.46" dur="4.56">loves us no matter how we&amp;#39;re being yeah</text>
  <text start="408.19" dur="3.36">I can only imagine what that must have</text>
  <text start="410.02" dur="5.07">been like I&amp;#39;ve talked to a lot of people</text>
  <text start="411.55" dur="5.45">who have walked into this gradual</text>
  <text start="415.09" dur="3.23">relationship with God</text>
  <text start="417" dur="3.78">and at the time things were happening</text>
  <text start="418.32" dur="5.04">God was arranging circumstances and</text>
  <text start="420.78" dur="5.58">arranging appointments and reaching out</text>
  <text start="423.36" dur="5.49">to them very subtle ways but most of the</text>
  <text start="426.36" dur="4.05">time people say at the time I really</text>
  <text start="428.85" dur="3.78">didn&amp;#39;t know that was him or maybe I</text>
  <text start="430.41" dur="4.62">suspected maybe it was but looking back</text>
  <text start="432.63" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s clear that he was speaking to them</text>
  <text start="435.03" dur="3.78">all the time reaching out trying to get</text>
  <text start="436.98" dur="3.9">your attention and it&amp;#39;s kind of cool how</text>
  <text start="438.81" dur="5.97">he does that I love it it&amp;#39;s so awesome I</text>
  <text start="440.88" dur="7.65">know he&amp;#39;s so wonderful so how long did</text>
  <text start="444.78" dur="6.36">you live as a lesbian definitely for</text>
  <text start="448.53" dur="4.47">that for that ten-year block that was</text>
  <text start="451.14" dur="6.75">you know active when I had relationships</text>
  <text start="453" dur="7.26">and stuff and then around 2005 I caught</text>
  <text start="457.89" dur="5.07">sick and so my life kind of crashed to a</text>
  <text start="460.26" dur="5.4">halt and I was in a place where I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="462.96" dur="4.8">really going out I was kind of just like</text>
  <text start="465.66" dur="3.93">being a shut-in inside and I wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="467.76" dur="3.84">really reaching out to anybody socially</text>
  <text start="469.59" dur="5.22">so I wasn&amp;#39;t actively doing things but i</text>
  <text start="471.6" dur="5.67">was still i was still writing a couple</text>
  <text start="474.81" dur="3.96">blogs back and forth on livejournal if</text>
  <text start="477.27" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;ve ever heard of that site that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="478.77" dur="4.709">like almost dead now and we were kind of</text>
  <text start="481.5" dur="4.62">writing stories together that were about</text>
  <text start="483.479" dur="3.961">homosexual situations as I guess it was</text>
  <text start="486.12" dur="2.79">kind of role playing in a way I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="487.44" dur="3.21">know but I wasn&amp;#39;t like physically with</text>
  <text start="488.91" dur="3.3">anybody but I was emotionally and</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="3.39">mentally putting myself into that</text>
  <text start="492.21" dur="3.269">position because I wasn&amp;#39;t like going out</text>
  <text start="494.04" dur="3.54">so I was on the internet with a couple</text>
  <text start="495.479" dur="5.821">people doing that okay it&amp;#39;s really weird</text>
  <text start="497.58" dur="5.91">yeah well I will say this and I was</text>
  <text start="501.3" dur="4.65">going to ask you about this I read your</text>
  <text start="503.49" dur="4.41">testimony and then I&amp;#39;ve read some things</text>
  <text start="505.95" dur="4.41">you&amp;#39;ve written since then and you are a</text>
  <text start="507.9" dur="5.28">very good writer I just want to pass</text>
  <text start="510.36" dur="5.13">that along you you really are if you are</text>
  <text start="513.18" dur="4.08">not blogging right now you might</text>
  <text start="515.49" dur="3.75">consider praying about that and asking</text>
  <text start="517.26" dur="4.68">the Lord if he wants you to write</text>
  <text start="519.24" dur="4.89">because you have a very good writing</text>
  <text start="521.94" dur="4.41">voice your message comes out very</text>
  <text start="524.13" dur="4.59">clearly you&amp;#39;re very empathetic you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="526.35" dur="4.489">very sincere and genuine I don&amp;#39;t think</text>
  <text start="528.72" dur="4.8">you have a phoney bone in your body that</text>
  <text start="530.839" dur="4.991">really comes through in your writing and</text>
  <text start="533.52" dur="5.01">you know just as a side note I had a</text>
  <text start="535.83" dur="3.93">dream about a week ago where the Lord</text>
  <text start="538.53" dur="3.84">gave me this dream and in the dream</text>
  <text start="539.76" dur="6.3">there were seven people who he had</text>
  <text start="542.37" dur="5.73">chosen to write books and in the dream I</text>
  <text start="546.06" dur="4.06">knew that there was a special anointing</text>
  <text start="548.1" dur="4.59">like the special season that</text>
  <text start="550.12" dur="4.53">arrived for people to write great</text>
  <text start="552.69" dur="3.07">productivity what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text>
  <text start="554.65" dur="2.58">during this season people are going to</text>
  <text start="555.76" dur="3.72">write more books and publish more books</text>
  <text start="557.23" dur="4.92">then would have been possible had it not</text>
  <text start="559.48" dur="4.56">been for divine empowerment and this is</text>
  <text start="562.15" dur="3.689">a season when God is really encouraging</text>
  <text start="564.04" dur="4.049">a lot of people to start writing and</text>
  <text start="565.839" dur="3.901">publishing so if that&amp;#39;s something that</text>
  <text start="568.089" dur="3.421">you&amp;#39;ve thought about and just pray about</text>
  <text start="569.74" dur="3.15">it and see if the Holy Spirit leads you</text>
  <text start="571.51" dur="3">to do that because you are a really good</text>
  <text start="572.89" dur="3.99">writer I mean your testimony in this</text>
  <text start="574.51" dur="4.98">whole subject is a subject of great</text>
  <text start="576.88" dur="4.5">interest to a lot of people I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="579.49" dur="4.68">receiving private messages from people</text>
  <text start="581.38" dur="5.37">and I jumped on this conversation the</text>
  <text start="584.17" dur="6.9">other day where a guy was asking for</text>
  <text start="586.75" dur="6.839">advice on how to witness to two lesbian</text>
  <text start="591.07" dur="4.44">people who were in his life as friends</text>
  <text start="593.589" dur="4.591">and they were very open and they were</text>

  <text start="638.14" dur="3.48">our business even though that private</text>
  <text start="639.88" dur="4.05">business should have been kept private I</text>
  <text start="641.62" dur="3.96">guess it just like I said earlier about</text>
  <text start="643.93" dur="3.24">about those political talk points</text>
  <text start="645.58" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re just getting votes and stuff by</text>

  <text start="655.33" dur="5.79">between them and God and as you know</text>
  <text start="658.9" dur="4.23">obviously the way that you know my</text>
  <text start="661.12" dur="5.339">testimony and everything you know how I</text>
  <text start="663.13" dur="4.709">feel about homosexuality and what he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="666.459" dur="3.661">come you know what I&amp;#39;ve come to learn</text>
  <text start="667.839" dur="4.471">what he&amp;#39;s taught me what he showed me in</text>
  <text start="670.12" dur="4.86">the Bible I mean he very very plainly</text>
  <text start="672.31" dur="5.01">says he doesn&amp;#39;t like it but reading that</text>
  <text start="674.98" dur="5.849">and being told that that never changed</text>
  <text start="677.32" dur="5.639">me what changed me was the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="680.829" dur="3.06">just soaking deeper and deeper into my</text>
  <text start="682.959" dur="3.57">soul</text>
  <text start="683.889" dur="6.48">like in my testimony I mentioned I was</text>
  <text start="686.529" dur="6.81">still participating in that lifestyle in</text>
  <text start="690.369" dur="5.58">the way that I could you know well into</text>
  <text start="693.339" dur="5.34">my you know reestablishment of my</text>
  <text start="695.949" dur="5.04">relationship with him and he didn&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="698.679" dur="4.56">know sit back and crossed his arms and</text>
  <text start="700.989" dur="4.41">say well when you stop being you know</text>
  <text start="703.239" dur="4.171">when you stop sinning I&amp;#39;ll talk to you</text>
  <text start="705.399" dur="5.28">and I&amp;#39;ll love on you he was loving on me</text>
  <text start="707.41" dur="5.399">the entire time but all throughout it as</text>
  <text start="710.679" dur="3.72">I was ready in different phases in</text>
  <text start="712.809" dur="4.14">different steps he showed me little</text>
  <text start="714.399" dur="5.4">things and sometimes big things about</text>
  <text start="716.949" dur="6.45">how he wanted a different life for me</text>
  <text start="719.799" dur="6.66">and how he had originally you know</text>
  <text start="723.399" dur="6.331">created me to be and he very slowly in</text>
  <text start="726.459" dur="5.16">in the way that only he can he restored</text>
  <text start="729.73" dur="5.039">me and healed me in the places that were</text>
  <text start="731.619" dur="4.41">causing I guess imbalances or brokenness</text>
  <text start="734.769" dur="4.86">you know whatever you want to call it</text>
  <text start="736.029" dur="5.67">that would help that lifestyle to come</text>
  <text start="739.629" dur="4.74">about and I mean I&amp;#39;m not going to walk</text>
  <text start="741.699" dur="4.17">up to somebody with you know at a pride</text>

  <text start="745.869" dur="5.101">sinning I don&amp;#39;t know you know the</text>
  <text start="748.569" dur="4.77">perfect advice to give somebody except</text>
  <text start="750.97" dur="3.779">just love people I mean it&amp;#39;s hard</text>
  <text start="753.339" dur="3.54">because you don&amp;#39;t want to affirm their</text>
  <text start="754.749" dur="4.32">sin but at the same time I just kind of</text>
  <text start="756.879" dur="4.231">feel like it&amp;#39;s not your business if</text>
  <text start="759.069" dur="3.901">somebody is a Christian people pretty</text>
  <text start="761.11" dur="3.389">much know how we feel about that we</text>
  <text start="762.97" dur="3.69">don&amp;#39;t have to really say it anymore I</text>
  <text start="764.499" dur="4.08">just keep thinking back to the Holy</text>
  <text start="766.66" dur="3.929">Spirit is the one that convicted me and</text>
  <text start="768.579" dur="5.19">changed me and healed me what was broken</text>
  <text start="770.589" dur="4.771">inside me and you know healed the things</text>
  <text start="773.769" dur="4.23">inside me that were helping that</text>
  <text start="775.36" dur="4.979">lifestyle to come about you mentioned</text>
  <text start="777.999" dur="4.02">that Jesus visited you in dreams and</text>
  <text start="780.339" dur="4.11">visions can you tell us a little bit</text>
  <text start="782.019" dur="4.891">about that okay yep when I came back</text>
  <text start="784.449" dur="3.93">from that lifestyle I still was</text>
  <text start="786.91" dur="4.049">reverting to my old patterns of like</text>
  <text start="788.379" dur="5.04">escapism so I was watching a lot of TV</text>
  <text start="790.959" dur="3.99">and reading a lot of books and you know</text>
  <text start="793.419" dur="3.57">writing those stories i was mentioning</text>
  <text start="794.949" dur="3.75">that i mentioned earlier with those you</text>
  <text start="796.989" dur="3.03">know friends back and forth that was</text>
  <text start="798.699" dur="4.651">about homosexual stuff you know</text>
  <text start="800.019" dur="5.641">situations and even even though i kept</text>
  <text start="803.35" dur="5.25">my attention on that stuff for a really</text>
  <text start="805.66" dur="5.639">long time he came through those things</text>
  <text start="808.6" dur="5.13">like I can&amp;#39;t explain exact details other</text>
  <text start="811.299" dur="4.53">than you know a character would say a</text>
  <text start="813.73" dur="3.52">line and just I just felt my heart just</text>
  <text start="815.829" dur="2.741">get really warm</text>
  <text start="817.25" dur="2.88">like I happen to have these thought</text>
  <text start="818.57" dur="3.48">patterns and now I can look back at it</text>
  <text start="820.13" dur="3.57">and know that was the Holy Spirit you</text>
  <text start="822.05" dur="3.81">know guiding me through these different</text>
  <text start="823.7" dur="5.28">revelations and as I was ready you know</text>
  <text start="825.86" dur="5.49">I came out of those movies and shows and</text>
  <text start="828.98" dur="4.35">cartoons &amp;amp; book + int you know more into</text>
  <text start="831.35" dur="4.05">the Bible and more into Christian</text>
  <text start="833.33" dur="4.92">worship music instead of rock music or</text>
  <text start="835.4" dur="5.4">whatever and he just very very gently</text>
  <text start="838.25" dur="4.68">drew me through these things that I was</text>
  <text start="840.8" dur="3.36">saturating my brain with I mean the</text>
  <text start="842.93" dur="4.05">dreams though they were right away but</text>
  <text start="844.16" dur="4.41">at first they were really like they were</text>
  <text start="846.98" dur="3.39">related to what I was putting into my</text>
  <text start="848.57" dur="4.47">brain like I would watch a lot of anime</text>
  <text start="850.37" dur="5.61">and I had would have a dream about this</text>
  <text start="853.04" dur="5.19">anime person where we were skipping in a</text>
  <text start="855.98" dur="4.71">field and suddenly we were skipping on</text>
  <text start="858.23" dur="5.31">the air and it&amp;#39;s just this you know</text>
  <text start="860.69" dur="5.85">really intricate and detailed dream but</text>
  <text start="863.54" dur="5.64">the the Holy Spirit just showed me what</text>
  <text start="866.54" dur="4.14">the details meant and slowly you know</text>
  <text start="869.18" dur="4.65">like I said gently drawing me out of</text>
  <text start="870.68" dur="5.49">that lifestyle but the first dream that</text>
  <text start="873.83" dur="4.38">I had like directly about him was this</text>
  <text start="876.17" dur="4.5">really awesome dream where there was the</text>
  <text start="878.21" dur="4.68">stairway and was going up into the sky</text>
  <text start="880.67" dur="4.26">and it was nighttime and at the top of</text>
  <text start="882.89" dur="3.48">the stairway there was this door and</text>
  <text start="884.93" dur="3.659">through the door you could basically</text>
  <text start="886.37" dur="5.55">like milky way galaxy kind of thing and</text>
  <text start="888.589" dur="6.301">I saw him the silhouette of Jesus coming</text>
  <text start="891.92" dur="4.77">down and when he got to the top of the</text>
  <text start="894.89" dur="3.6">stairs I was still pretty far down I</text>
  <text start="896.69" dur="3.899">could see his face and it just got</text>
  <text start="898.49" dur="5.4">magnified and he was looking at me and</text>
  <text start="900.589" dur="5.821">smiling and just from that moment I just</text>
  <text start="903.89" dur="4.89">felt like I don&amp;#39;t know he just that was</text>
  <text start="906.41" dur="4.32">one of the huge steps in you know coming</text>
  <text start="908.78" dur="3.54">closer to him and even though I thought</text>
  <text start="910.73" dur="3.75">that I knew he was real like really</text>
  <text start="912.32" dur="3.75">being like wow I feel even more so that</text>
  <text start="914.48" dur="3.9">he was real you know and I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="916.07" dur="3.75">it&amp;#39;s just that feeling when he&amp;#39;s smiling</text>
  <text start="918.38" dur="3.57">at you I know it sounds so weird but</text>
  <text start="919.82" dur="3.6">that&amp;#39;s one of my most cherished memories</text>
  <text start="921.95" dur="4.889">and it was just things like that where</text>
  <text start="923.42" dur="4.8">he would just send these dreams where he</text>
  <text start="926.839" dur="4.741">would just reveal things to me and it</text>
  <text start="928.22" dur="5.1">was just this slow process over I mean</text>
  <text start="931.58" dur="4.32">you know since 2005 that was ten years</text>
  <text start="933.32" dur="4.44">ago so over the past 10 years where he</text>
  <text start="935.9" dur="3.45">just keeps drawing me closer and closer</text>
  <text start="937.76" dur="3.36">to him and that&amp;#39;s still happening every</text>
  <text start="939.35" dur="3.51">single day where it&amp;#39;s just like he can</text>
  <text start="941.12" dur="4.23">do more in one dream than we can with</text>
  <text start="942.86" dur="4.229">like the absolute most intelligent</text>
  <text start="945.35" dur="3.43">arguments that we can make against the</text>
  <text start="947.089" dur="3.641">homosexuality he can</text>
  <text start="948.78" dur="3.54">do more in like a two second dream than</text>
  <text start="950.73" dur="3.78">wait could ever hope to with our best</text>
  <text start="952.32" dur="3.81">intentions would you have any advice for</text>
  <text start="954.51" dur="4.14">someone who is in a gay or lesbian</text>
  <text start="956.13" dur="5.13">lifestyle who wants to come out of it</text>
  <text start="958.65" dur="5.73">but is still having attraction towards</text>
  <text start="961.26" dur="4.65">people of the same sex yeah um I mean I</text>
  <text start="964.38" dur="4.53">had that for a while where I still felt</text>
  <text start="965.91" dur="5.07">attracted and I was in a phase where I</text>
  <text start="968.91" dur="4.26">was thinking to myself you know well God</text>
  <text start="970.98" dur="3.69">loves me I&amp;#39;m you know I can be this way</text>
  <text start="973.17" dur="4.11">he made me this way you know I mean I</text>

  <text start="977.28" dur="5.58">trying to get out of that lifestyle and</text>
  <text start="979.88" dur="5.53">just slowly slowly and I&amp;#39;m pretty slow</text>
  <text start="982.86" dur="5.19">and dense sometimes and stubborn so over</text>
  <text start="985.41" dur="4.71">the years it was just tiny little steps</text>
  <text start="988.05" dur="4.05">and sometimes big steps and he just</text>
  <text start="990.12" dur="3.96">showed me that I mean I wasn&amp;#39;t actively</text>

  <text start="1135.59" dur="4.11">all he wants it sounds like you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1137.93" dur="4.17">saying that a lot of the confrontations</text>
  <text start="1139.7" dur="4.8">Christians get into actually end up</text>
  <text start="1142.1" dur="5.01">pushing people away from God oh yeah</text>
  <text start="1144.5" dur="4.98">which is the opposite of what we want</text>
  <text start="1147.11" dur="4.05">yes yeah and I mean I can understand it</text>
  <text start="1149.48" dur="4.29">completely understand why we feel that</text>
  <text start="1151.16" dur="4.23">we have to do that but we need to just</text>
  <text start="1153.77" dur="3.21">seek the Lord about that and he can help</text>
  <text start="1155.39" dur="3.24">us when there are things that should be</text>
  <text start="1156.98" dur="3.39">said and when you just need to love on</text>
  <text start="1158.63" dur="3.36">somebody you know I mean there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1160.37" dur="3.57">a time for everything and I think we</text>
  <text start="1161.99" dur="3.81">keep trying to figure it out in our own</text>
  <text start="1163.94" dur="3.24">head but we need to keep just praying</text>
  <text start="1165.8" dur="4.38">and asking him you know help me reach</text>
  <text start="1167.18" dur="5.85">people today I think there&amp;#39;s an there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1170.18" dur="5.55">an element of pushing back against</text>
  <text start="1173.03" dur="5.42">oppression and against you know the</text>
  <text start="1175.73" dur="5.43">rejection and the condemnation that</text>
  <text start="1178.45" dur="5.92">unfortunately the whole issue has been</text>
  <text start="1181.16" dur="5.28">causing for a lot of people and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1184.37" dur="4.65">just a very in your face you better</text>
  <text start="1186.44" dur="4.29">accept me this is who I am it&amp;#39;s just I</text>
  <text start="1189.02" dur="3.18">guess rebellion would be the best way to</text>
  <text start="1190.73" dur="3.96">describe it where you&amp;#39;re just rebelling</text>
  <text start="1192.2" dur="5.37">against being put down soap for so long</text>
  <text start="1194.69" dur="5.49">I mean this private matter that should</text>
  <text start="1197.57" dur="4.89">be something that is between you and God</text>
  <text start="1200.18" dur="4.98">where you know he knows what he wants</text>
  <text start="1202.46" dur="5.67">for us all and His Holy Spirit you know</text>
  <text start="1205.16" dur="6.03">he&amp;#39;s the one who&amp;#39;s responsible and able</text>
  <text start="1208.13" dur="5.34">to heal the things inside us that caused</text>
  <text start="1211.19" dur="3.39">sin or whatever that is keeping us</text>
  <text start="1213.47" dur="3.54">separate from him</text>
  <text start="1214.58" dur="4.56">and the church with well with good</text>
  <text start="1217.01" dur="6.149">intentions but destructive consequences</text>
  <text start="1219.14" dur="6.659">has been oppressive about it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1223.159" dur="5.4">now this thing where it&amp;#39;s kind of like a</text>
  <text start="1225.799" dur="4.141">middle finger now you know don&amp;#39;t put me</text>
  <text start="1228.559" dur="2.581">down anymore this is who I am and</text>
  <text start="1229.94" dur="3.66">there&amp;#39;s more and more people that are</text>
  <text start="1231.14" dur="4.919">tired of being put down and it&amp;#39;s become</text>
  <text start="1233.6" dur="5.13">this this big fight now and it&amp;#39;s really</text>
  <text start="1236.059" dur="5.011">heartbreaking because we need to not be</text>
  <text start="1238.73" dur="4.289">fighting we need to just be loving each</text>
  <text start="1241.07" dur="3.57">other and it&amp;#39;s the exact opposite and</text>
  <text start="1243.019" dur="4.861">I&amp;#39;m sure the devil&amp;#39;s laughing his butt</text>
  <text start="1244.64" dur="6.09">off right now about it my wife has a pet</text>
  <text start="1247.88" dur="4.86">peeve about life in the church you know</text>
  <text start="1250.73" dur="3.87">pastors say that the church isn&amp;#39;t a</text>
  <text start="1252.74" dur="3.72">museum for Saints it&amp;#39;s a hospital for</text>
  <text start="1254.6" dur="3.929">sinners and I think we all understand</text>
  <text start="1256.46" dur="4.62">that but at the same time there are a</text>
  <text start="1258.529" dur="5.581">lot of church congregations where if you</text>
  <text start="1261.08" dur="4.709">talk about your own sins openly you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1264.11" dur="3.449">going to cause yourself a lot of trouble</text>
  <text start="1265.789" dur="4.441">and if you&amp;#39;re in a position of</text>
  <text start="1267.559" dur="4.85">leadership and your own sins are</text>
  <text start="1270.23" dur="4.289">discovered you might very well be</text>
  <text start="1272.409" dur="5.14">removed from your position of leadership</text>
  <text start="1274.519" dur="5.101">it&amp;#39;s like we have this culture where</text>
  <text start="1277.549" dur="3.931">church leaders don&amp;#39;t really know what to</text>
  <text start="1279.62" dur="4.439">do with people who are struggling with</text>
  <text start="1281.48" dur="3.96">sin and in some places it&amp;#39;s just a lot</text>
  <text start="1284.059" dur="3.24">easier to sweep it under the rug or</text>
  <text start="1285.44" dur="4.17">pretend it&amp;#39;s not there and I think</text>
  <text start="1287.299" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s some wisdom in keeping some sins</text>
  <text start="1289.61" dur="2.97">to yourself and working them out with</text>
  <text start="1291.139" dur="3.691">God but ultimately the role of</text>
  <text start="1292.58" dur="4.74">leadership is to bring people into a</text>
  <text start="1294.83" dur="4.86">closer relationship with god and to help</text>
  <text start="1297.32" dur="4.29">them talk about their things that they</text>
  <text start="1299.69" dur="5.67">struggle with openly so that God can</text>
  <text start="1301.61" dur="6.529">heal them mm-hmm exactly i mean when</text>
  <text start="1305.36" dur="5.88">when people on the church or you know</text>
  <text start="1308.139" dur="6.01">christian believers are struggling with</text>
  <text start="1311.24" dur="5.85">some sin i mean i don&amp;#39;t think that makes</text>
  <text start="1314.149" dur="5.941">them that not saved that&amp;#39;s kind of</text>
  <text start="1317.09" dur="4.86">ridiculous but I mean I we&amp;#39;re all in</text>
  <text start="1320.09" dur="3.449">different stages with our brokenness and</text>
  <text start="1321.95" dur="3.719">he&amp;#39;s working on each and every one of us</text>
  <text start="1323.539" dur="4.291">and i think i can&amp;#39;t remember what bible</text>
  <text start="1325.669" dur="4.591">verse it is but it says you know when</text>
  <text start="1327.83" dur="5.459">when somebody is sending you know you</text>
  <text start="1330.26" dur="5.49">come to them in humility and you know in</text>
  <text start="1333.289" dur="4.431">in love and you tell them you know</text>
  <text start="1335.75" dur="4.74">humility meaning you know you</text>
  <text start="1337.72" dur="4.959">acknowledge that you&amp;#39;re not perfect and</text>
  <text start="1340.49" dur="3.6">you&amp;#39;re not trying to you know beat them</text>
  <text start="1342.679" dur="4.061">over the head with a Bible or something</text>
  <text start="1344.09" dur="4.839">but you know they&amp;#39;re doing something</text>
  <text start="1346.74" dur="5.13">you know you you&amp;#39;re seeing is not</text>
  <text start="1348.929" dur="4.891">helping them and ask them if you can</text>
  <text start="1351.87" dur="3.809">pray for them or whatever I mean it</text>
  <text start="1353.82" dur="3.18">doesn&amp;#39;t say you know go to them and tell</text>
  <text start="1355.679" dur="4.141">them that they can&amp;#39;t come back to church</text>
  <text start="1357" dur="4.02">I mean this I don&amp;#39;t know church</text>
  <text start="1359.82" dur="3.12">discipline or whatever you want to call</text>
  <text start="1361.02" dur="3.96">it or you know accountability with</text>
  <text start="1362.94" dur="4.5">within the church like that&amp;#39;s all it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1364.98" dur="4.59">it&amp;#39;s really intricate and delicate and I</text>
  <text start="1367.44" dur="4.34">just think that we&amp;#39;re not handling it</text>
  <text start="1369.57" dur="4.8">very well there needs to be a lot more</text>
  <text start="1371.78" dur="4.54">prayer and a lot less figuring out at</text>
  <text start="1374.37" dur="4.59">our own head and working from our own</text>
  <text start="1376.32" dur="5.489">understanding i think i&amp;#39;m just i keep</text>
  <text start="1378.96" dur="6.06">praying for just the holy spirit to just</text>
  <text start="1381.809" dur="5.881">sweep through and help us not destroy</text>
  <text start="1385.02" dur="4.62">each other so much you know from for the</text>
  <text start="1387.69" dur="4.59">perspective of people that you know</text>
  <text start="1389.64" dur="4.919">haven&amp;#39;t had any you know kind of</text>
  <text start="1392.28" dur="4.11">struggle with same-sex attraction and</text>
  <text start="1394.559" dur="5.071">you know they&amp;#39;re trying to figure out</text>
  <text start="1396.39" dur="6.39">how do I treat you know these people</text>
  <text start="1399.63" dur="5.37">that are being so flamboyant or so in my</text>
  <text start="1402.78" dur="6.06">face about this I don&amp;#39;t want to betray</text>
  <text start="1405" dur="6.33">my my own faith or misrepresent God like</text>
  <text start="1408.84" dur="4.32">they don&amp;#39;t want to affirm it I just</text>
  <text start="1411.33" dur="4.26">don&amp;#39;t think that telling them that</text>
  <text start="1413.16" dur="4.83">they&amp;#39;re wrong is helpful I think that</text>
  <text start="1415.59" dur="3.81">you keep showing affection and love just</text>
  <text start="1417.99" dur="4.35">like you always did before they came out</text>
  <text start="1419.4" dur="5.1">and you know if they start talking about</text>
  <text start="1422.34" dur="4.86">that stuff just pray and ask Jesus to</text>
  <text start="1424.5" dur="5.85">help you know how to speak know how to</text>
  <text start="1427.2" dur="5.67">act I don&amp;#39;t know it he&amp;#39;s given me grace</text>

  <text start="1432.87" dur="4.92">keep reaching out to them and I&amp;#39;ve had a</text>
  <text start="1435.54" dur="4.41">couple of people where the Lord gave me</text>
  <text start="1437.79" dur="4.23">the precious honor of being able to see</text>
  <text start="1439.95" dur="4.08">them turn away from it and it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1442.02" dur="4.56">because of anything I said or did it was</text>
  <text start="1444.03" dur="4.74">just that he was working in them each</text>
  <text start="1446.58" dur="4.11">one of us are in a different place with</text>
  <text start="1448.77" dur="5.01">the people that he&amp;#39;s put around us and</text>
  <text start="1450.69" dur="5.28">where we are with our own emotions and</text>
  <text start="1453.78" dur="3.87">our own maturity the whole point of this</text>
  <text start="1455.97" dur="4.92">life is to learn how to love each other</text>
