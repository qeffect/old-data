  <text start="14.099" dur="2.571">today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="17.65" dur="6.01">welcome to supernatural Saturday do we</text>
  <text start="21.02" dur="5.309">are continuing through the book divine</text>
  <text start="23.66" dur="6.09">healing made simple and we are in</text>
  <text start="26.329" dur="7.501">chapter 9 which is God&amp;#39;s healing</text>
  <text start="29.75" dur="6.72">presence in my book I discuss a lot of</text>
  <text start="33.83" dur="5.67">different tools that we can use for</text>
  <text start="36.47" dur="5.43">healing the last two weeks we talked</text>
  <text start="39.5" dur="4.769">about power and authority and how power</text>
  <text start="41.9" dur="4.5">and authority are different power is</text>
  <text start="44.269" dur="5.761">like energy and it flows like</text>
  <text start="46.4" dur="6.21">electricity Authority is the legal right</text>
  <text start="50.03" dur="3.15">and permission we have that God has</text>
  <text start="52.61" dur="1.74">given us</text>
  <text start="53.18" dur="3.29">that&amp;#39;s authority so there are two</text>
  <text start="54.35" dur="5.55">different things we talked about those I</text>
  <text start="56.47" dur="5.829">about faith that was the chapter before</text>
  <text start="59.9" dur="5.21">that it was three weeks ago how faith is</text>
  <text start="62.299" dur="5.791">like is almost like a trigger that</text>
  <text start="65.11" dur="5.56">releases power that releases Authority</text>
  <text start="68.09" dur="4.83">and so now we&amp;#39;re going into a completely</text>
  <text start="70.67" dur="5.64">different section in the book and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="72.92" dur="5.33">gonna talk about God&amp;#39;s glory now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="76.31" dur="5.04">gonna give you just a really short</text>
  <text start="78.25" dur="7.27">teaching from the Old Testament on God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="81.35" dur="6.6">glory when Moses built the tabernacle in</text>
  <text start="85.52" dur="4.8">the wilderness when he built it the way</text>
  <text start="87.95" dur="4.709">God asked him to build it and they put</text>
  <text start="90.32" dur="3.63">in all the instruments the labor and all</text>
  <text start="92.659" dur="3.451">the bronze and silver and gold</text>
  <text start="93.95" dur="8.19">instruments and they did sacrifices in</text>
  <text start="96.11" dur="9.15">the tabernacle God&amp;#39;s manifest glory his</text>
  <text start="102.14" dur="6.839">presence came into the tabernacle and</text>
  <text start="105.26" dur="6.3">there was a cloud that was visible you</text>
  <text start="108.979" dur="5.25">could see God&amp;#39;s manifest presence in the</text>
  <text start="111.56" dur="4.8">tabernacle that was how the Israelites</text>
  <text start="114.229" dur="2.701">kind of communicated with God they hung</text>
  <text start="116.36" dur="2.46">out with him</text>
  <text start="116.93" dur="4.74">they could see his glory they could see</text>
  <text start="118.82" dur="5.15">the cloud interestingly enough when they</text>
  <text start="121.67" dur="6.569">were wandering in the wilderness God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="123.97" dur="6.909">presence shielded them as a pillar of</text>
  <text start="128.239" dur="5.341">cloud by day and as a pillar of fire by</text>
  <text start="130.879" dur="5.011">night that was another manifestation of</text>
  <text start="133.58" dur="4.89">God&amp;#39;s glory of his presence so God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="135.89" dur="6.209">glory his presence can manifest in the</text>
  <text start="138.47" dur="5.879">earth as clouds as columns of fire as</text>
  <text start="142.099" dur="5.101">many different things that you can see</text>
  <text start="144.349" dur="4.98">and you can sense you can feel God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="147.2" dur="3.43">glory can feel his presence now for</text>
  <text start="149.329" dur="4.361">those of you</text>
  <text start="150.63" dur="6.06">who has struggled with your belief in</text>
  <text start="153.69" dur="4.98">God with your faith this is a very very</text>
  <text start="156.69" dur="5.34">important message I&amp;#39;d like you to listen</text>
  <text start="158.67" dur="5.55">to if you have friends who are</text>
  <text start="162.03" dur="4.8">struggling with their faith who are</text>
  <text start="164.22" dur="5.46">struggling to know God who wants to know</text>
  <text start="166.83" dur="5.25">if God&amp;#39;s real I would suggest sharing</text>
  <text start="169.68" dur="5.46">this message with them because at the</text>
  <text start="172.08" dur="6.06">end of this message I&amp;#39;m going to do an</text>
  <text start="175.14" dur="7.29">exercise and I&amp;#39;m going to ask God to</text>
  <text start="178.14" dur="6.78">touch you with his presence so that you</text>
  <text start="182.43" dur="4.35">can feel his presence and know that he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="184.92" dur="3.96">real so that&amp;#39;s at the end of this</text>
  <text start="186.78" dur="5.04">message we&amp;#39;ll do a little exercise I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="188.88" dur="4.95">going to explain how I learned how to do</text>
  <text start="191.82" dur="5.28">this why it works and then we&amp;#39;ll do an</text>
  <text start="193.83" dur="6.18">exercise at the end so this is a good</text>
  <text start="197.1" dur="6.53">message for people who are agnostic sand</text>
  <text start="200.01" dur="7.26">skeptics to listen to because many times</text>
  <text start="203.63" dur="5.68">when I pray for somebody they will feel</text>
  <text start="207.27" dur="5.85">God&amp;#39;s presence and and we&amp;#39;re not in the</text>
  <text start="209.31" dur="6.03">same room I got an email from a woman a</text>
  <text start="213.12" dur="4.92">couple of weeks ago she had sent me a</text>
  <text start="215.34" dur="4.32">prayer request and I had missed the</text>
  <text start="218.04" dur="3.93">prayer request for a couple of days I</text>
  <text start="219.66" dur="4.17">don&amp;#39;t answer prayer requests every</text>
  <text start="221.97" dur="5.16">single day I&amp;#39;m kind of busy</text>
  <text start="223.83" dur="5.4">and so I answer them when I can I tend</text>
  <text start="227.13" dur="3.99">to take a block of time two or three</text>
  <text start="229.23" dur="3.81">hours and answer prayer requests so that</text>
  <text start="231.12" dur="4.05">day I was going through prayer requests</text>
  <text start="233.04" dur="4.86">and I was praying for this woman I just</text>
  <text start="235.17" dur="4.95">sit back in my chair and I look at the</text>
  <text start="237.9" dur="3.12">prayer request and say okay if it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="240.12" dur="3.57">sickness or disease</text>
  <text start="241.02" dur="5.13">I exercise Authority I release power</text>
  <text start="243.69" dur="7.29">sometimes I&amp;#39;ll dispatch angels to go and</text>
  <text start="246.15" dur="7.92">heal them and most often I will simply</text>
  <text start="250.98" dur="5.7">ask God to bring his presence his glory</text>
  <text start="254.07" dur="6">and touch them and let them know he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="256.68" dur="6">real well I did that and I got an email</text>
  <text start="260.07" dur="5.52">back from the woman I think later on</text>
  <text start="262.68" dur="4.92">that day she said it&amp;#39;s the most amazing</text>
  <text start="265.59" dur="3.75">thing I looked at the time stamp on your</text>
  <text start="267.6" dur="5.04">on your email when you sent me this</text>
  <text start="269.34" dur="6.57">message and at the very time that I got</text>
  <text start="272.64" dur="7.05">this message in my email I was feeling</text>
  <text start="275.91" dur="7.77">this euphoria I felt this joy overcoming</text>
  <text start="279.69" dur="4.74">I felt God&amp;#39;s glory on me it was it just</text>
  <text start="283.68" dur="2.19">hit me out</text>
  <text start="284.43" dur="5.43">the blue I was minding my own business</text>
  <text start="285.87" dur="6.42">and bam I felt this incredible intense</text>
  <text start="289.86" dur="4.29">feeling of glory on me and it happened</text>
  <text start="292.29" dur="5.04">at the same time I was praying for her</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="7.11">because of her email so I have seen</text>
  <text start="297.33" dur="7.11">people receive a healing touch from God</text>
  <text start="301.26" dur="5.04">a manifestation of his glory just from</text>
  <text start="304.44" dur="3.06">me praying for them and I don&amp;#39;t even</text>
  <text start="306.3" dur="2.88">know where these people are they&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="307.5" dur="4.41">all around the world</text>
  <text start="309.18" dur="5.46">I get prayer requests from South Africa</text>
  <text start="311.91" dur="6.24">and South America and all over I have</text>
  <text start="314.64" dur="5.84">learned through practice that whenever</text>
  <text start="318.15" dur="6">I&amp;#39;m praying for someone to be healed I</text>
  <text start="320.48" dur="6.01">simply say Lord bring your glory bring</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="4.68">your presence upon it now Denise and I</text>
  <text start="326.49" dur="3.78">learned how to do this years ago I had</text>
  <text start="328.83" dur="4.34">been following the teaching of a guy</text>
  <text start="330.27" dur="6.93">named Brian Fenimore Brian Fenimore is a</text>
  <text start="333.17" dur="8.62">charismatic teacher Brian was a student</text>
  <text start="337.2" dur="7.98">of John Wimber and Wimber was a very</text>
  <text start="341.79" dur="5.97">gifted teacher on healing and God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="345.18" dur="4.26">glory and Wimber was really big in the</text>
  <text start="347.76" dur="5.04">70s and 80s during the Jesus people</text>
  <text start="349.44" dur="6.09">movement and Brian Fenimore was</text>
  <text start="352.8" dur="4.68">discipled by John Wimber so he was big</text>
  <text start="355.53" dur="4.71">in healing and manifestations of God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="357.48" dur="4.71">glory well I had been listening to Brian</text>
  <text start="360.24" dur="4.44">Fenimore as messages on YouTube when I</text>
  <text start="362.19" dur="4.59">was learning how to do healing eight</text>
  <text start="364.68" dur="5.73">nine years ago I ran into Brian&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="366.78" dur="5.52">messages and they really struck me he</text>
  <text start="370.41" dur="6.81">was a really good instructor but he also</text>
  <text start="372.3" dur="6.87">taught how about how to cooperate with</text>
  <text start="377.22" dur="4.95">the Holy Spirit how to cooperate with</text>
  <text start="379.17" dur="4.74">God in his presence and getting back to</text>
  <text start="382.17" dur="6.75">I kind of rabbit trailed here for a</text>
  <text start="383.91" dur="6.63">second but Brian taught me how to ask</text>
  <text start="388.92" dur="3.9">God to bring his glory in his presence</text>
  <text start="390.54" dur="4.95">into a room Denise and I started doing</text>
  <text start="392.82" dur="5.28">that we would sit in a room in our</text>
  <text start="395.49" dur="6.45">chairs and we would be quiet and still</text>
  <text start="398.1" dur="6.12">and simply ask God to bring his presence</text>
  <text start="401.94" dur="6.75">or his glory into the room I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="404.22" dur="7.35">wait and we would ask and we wait and</text>
  <text start="408.69" dur="6.99">within a few minutes every single time I</text>
  <text start="411.57" dur="6.64">would feel this change in my body and so</text>
  <text start="415.68" dur="7.26">Denise she feels God&amp;#39;s glory like</text>
  <text start="418.21" dur="8.28">wait pushing down on her I feel this</text>
  <text start="422.94" dur="6.22">involuntary swaying back and forth it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="426.49" dur="4.53">just a gentle swaying some people feel</text>
  <text start="429.16" dur="4.5">tingling some people feel a little bit</text>
  <text start="431.02" dur="4.89">of warmth everybody feels God&amp;#39;s glory a</text>
  <text start="433.66" dur="4.68">little bit differently but you can feel</text>
  <text start="435.91" dur="4.2">his glory and so when I started</text>
  <text start="438.34" dur="4.47">listening to Brian and he was teaching</text>
  <text start="440.11" dur="4.92">how to do this I incorporated that into</text>
  <text start="442.81" dur="5.28">my practice of prayer and healing people</text>
  <text start="445.03" dur="4.949">and it has done some amazing things I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="448.09" dur="3.48">just gonna be honest with you now I</text>
  <text start="449.979" dur="3.03">wanted to go back and I said I was gonna</text>
  <text start="451.57" dur="1.95">teach from the Old Testament just a</text>
  <text start="453.009" dur="4.621">little bit</text>
  <text start="453.52" dur="7.11">when Moses had been doing the sacrifices</text>
  <text start="457.63" dur="6.24">in the tabernacle at one point Solomon</text>
  <text start="460.63" dur="5.73">built a temple and they brought all the</text>
  <text start="463.87" dur="4.829">instruments of worship into the temple</text>
  <text start="466.36" dur="3.21">and this is found in second chronicles</text>
  <text start="468.699" dur="3.15">chapter 5</text>
  <text start="469.57" dur="3.839">I&amp;#39;m gonna read two verses for you so</text>
  <text start="471.849" dur="3.031">they brought the people they brought the</text>
  <text start="473.409" dur="2.701">instruments about everything up to the</text>
  <text start="474.88" dur="4.11">temple for the dedication of the temple</text>
  <text start="476.11" dur="5.82">and there is people there who played</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="6.72">musical instruments and they sang</text>
  <text start="481.93" dur="8.609">worship music now here is what second</text>
  <text start="485.71" dur="7.26">chronicles 5 13 14 says it came to pass</text>
  <text start="490.539" dur="6.81">when the trumpeters and the singers were</text>
  <text start="492.97" dur="7.02">as one to make a sound to be heard in</text>
  <text start="497.349" dur="4.681">praising and thanking the Lord and when</text>
  <text start="499.99" dur="4.32">they lifted up their voice with trumpets</text>
  <text start="502.03" dur="4.889">and cymbals and instruments of music and</text>
  <text start="504.31" dur="5.579">praise the Lord they said for he is good</text>
  <text start="506.919" dur="5.91">his mercy endures forever that the house</text>
  <text start="509.889" dur="4.921">of the Lord was filled with a cloud so</text>
  <text start="512.829" dur="4.861">that the priests could not continue</text>
  <text start="514.81" dur="5.31">ministering because of the cloud for the</text>
  <text start="517.69" dur="5.01">glory of the Lord filled the house the</text>
  <text start="520.12" dur="4.17">glory became so thick in the temple they</text>
  <text start="522.7" dur="4.079">could not minister in the temple anymore</text>
  <text start="524.29" dur="6.66">in some translations it says they could</text>
  <text start="526.779" dur="6.661">not stand to minister they fell down on</text>
  <text start="530.95" dur="6.21">the ground because the glory was so</text>
  <text start="533.44" dur="8.639">thick it made them unable to stand God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="537.16" dur="7.11">glory can affect your senses and your</text>
  <text start="542.079" dur="4.861">brain and your ability to think and even</text>
  <text start="544.27" dur="6.179">stand I remember praying for a friend of</text>
  <text start="546.94" dur="5.16">mine in a parking lot after a conference</text>
  <text start="550.449" dur="4.771">a couple of years ago here in free</text>
  <text start="552.1" dur="4.56">and I she was wanted prayer I was</text>
  <text start="555.22" dur="3.06">praying for her and I was like Lord</text>
  <text start="556.66" dur="3.45">bring your glory bring your presence</text>
  <text start="558.28" dur="4.34">next thing you know she&amp;#39;s on her knees</text>
  <text start="560.11" dur="4.26">in the parking lot trying to stand up</text>
  <text start="562.62" dur="4.66">almost falling over</text>
  <text start="564.37" dur="4.65">because God&amp;#39;s glory came and hit her so</text>
  <text start="567.28" dur="3.99">hard it almost took her down on her face</text>
  <text start="569.02" dur="5.61">I have been in a lot of meetings where</text>
  <text start="571.27" dur="5.01">I&amp;#39;ve seen people just ban collapse under</text>
  <text start="574.63" dur="3.87">the power of God that is what God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="576.28" dur="4.59">glory can do and if you think it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="578.5" dur="3.99">biblical I just read to the scriptures</text>
  <text start="580.87" dur="3.99">where it says the priests were unable to</text>
  <text start="582.49" dur="6.09">stand in the temple because of the glory</text>
  <text start="584.86" dur="7.19">I I had seen some amazing things happen</text>
  <text start="588.58" dur="7.23">when God&amp;#39;s presence when his glory</text>
  <text start="592.05" dur="5.59">manifests in a room I&amp;#39;ve told many of</text>
  <text start="595.81" dur="3.24">you this story before but I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>
  <text start="597.64" dur="3.96">share it again because it&amp;#39;s just one of</text>
  <text start="599.05" dur="4.11">my favorite stories last year I was</text>
  <text start="601.6" dur="4.56">teaching at the Southwest School of the</text>
  <text start="603.16" dur="4.68">supernatural and we were in Gilbert me</text>
  <text start="606.16" dur="4.53">and my friend Tom Sherm Itzler had been</text>
  <text start="607.84" dur="6.51">teaching all week they had meetings in</text>
  <text start="610.69" dur="5.61">Prescott and Payson Maricopa I think and</text>
  <text start="614.35" dur="4.23">Gilbert and one in Phoenix and we were</text>
  <text start="616.3" dur="5.46">going around and Tom had an injured back</text>
  <text start="618.58" dur="4.56">he had really severe back pain radiated</text>
  <text start="621.76" dur="4.14">on the back of his leg he had sciatic</text>
  <text start="623.14" dur="4.47">nerve pain he&amp;#39;d had it all week and the</text>
  <text start="625.9" dur="2.85">students had been praying for him and he</text>
  <text start="627.61" dur="3.36">had received a lot of prayer that week</text>
  <text start="628.75" dur="4.5">and he wasn&amp;#39;t healed so he came into the</text>
  <text start="630.97" dur="5.07">Friday meeting and he still was in it</text>
  <text start="633.25" dur="4.74">having intense back pain so the first</text>
  <text start="636.04" dur="4.47">thing we do before we did our teaching</text>
  <text start="637.99" dur="4.59">and we were teaching on healing and I</text>
  <text start="640.51" dur="3.03">was teaching on the tools that God has</text>
  <text start="642.58" dur="3.93">given us for healing</text>
  <text start="643.54" dur="4.98">so before we did the teaching we did</text>
  <text start="646.51" dur="3.93">some worship and the worship band is up</text>

  <text start="712.36" dur="3.78">gonna share a couple of dreams with you</text>
  <text start="713.92" dur="5.52">that I&amp;#39;ve had that speak about God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="716.14" dur="5.97">glory I had a dream a few years ago</text>
  <text start="719.44" dur="5.64">where I was transporting a man in the</text>
  <text start="722.11" dur="4.47">ambulance who had severe crushing</text>
  <text start="725.08" dur="4.47">injuries he looked like he had been run</text>
  <text start="726.58" dur="4.74">over by a dump truck and I put him in</text>
  <text start="729.55" dur="3.72">the ambulance I transferred it into the</text>
  <text start="731.32" dur="5.85">hospital and I didn&amp;#39;t do any medical</text>
  <text start="733.27" dur="6.87">treatment on him no splinting no IVs no</text>
  <text start="737.17" dur="5.64">EKG nothing didn&amp;#39;t do any treatment I</text>
  <text start="740.14" dur="5.25">got him to the hospital took him into</text>
  <text start="742.81" dur="5.25">the room and the doctor examined him and</text>
  <text start="745.39" dur="5.34">said did you do anything for him on the</text>
  <text start="748.06" dur="4.16">way here and I said no and the doctor</text>
  <text start="750.73" dur="5.49">goes well there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with him</text>
  <text start="752.22" dur="8.14">in the dream I didn&amp;#39;t do anything for</text>
  <text start="756.22" dur="7.29">him because I could sense God&amp;#39;s presence</text>
  <text start="760.36" dur="5.13">in the ambulance and God&amp;#39;s glory his</text>
  <text start="763.51" dur="4.53">presence completely healed</text>
  <text start="765.49" dur="4.02">all of this guy&amp;#39;s crushing injuries so</text>
  <text start="768.04" dur="4.169">that when I got him to the hospital he</text>
  <text start="769.51" dur="5.07">had no injuries that was a dream where</text>
  <text start="772.209" dur="4.651">God was teaching me about his glory how</text>
  <text start="774.58" dur="5.16">his presence can heal and I don&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="776.86" dur="4.32">to do anything I don&amp;#39;t have to pray I</text>
  <text start="779.74" dur="2.88">don&amp;#39;t have to command I don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="781.18" dur="4.74">stand on the Word of God I don&amp;#39;t to do</text>
  <text start="782.62" dur="5.61">anything when God&amp;#39;s glory is there his</text>
  <text start="785.92" dur="4.74">glory can heal anything</text>
  <text start="788.23" dur="6.18">and so God was teaching me in that dream</text>
  <text start="790.66" dur="5.34">what his glory can do now I have another</text>
  <text start="794.41" dur="4.619">dream I&amp;#39;d like to share with you and</text>
  <text start="796" dur="5.88">this is this is important if you pray</text>
  <text start="799.029" dur="4.861">for people to be healed and you ask</text>
  <text start="801.88" dur="4.2">yourself well what do I do if they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="803.89" dur="4.44">not healed you know I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="806.08" dur="3.57">embarrassed I&amp;#39;m gonna be scared because</text>
  <text start="808.33" dur="3.06">if I pray for them and they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="809.65" dur="3">healed maybe they&amp;#39;re not gonna believe</text>
  <text start="811.39" dur="3">in God maybe they&amp;#39;re not gonna believe</text>
  <text start="812.65" dur="3.33">God&amp;#39;s power is real I don&amp;#39;t want to pray</text>
  <text start="814.39" dur="3.24">for people to be healed I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="815.98" dur="3.02">them to be disappointed</text>
  <text start="817.63" dur="4.02">okay so we go through all these</text>
  <text start="819" dur="4.33">different reasons in our mind where we</text>
  <text start="821.65" dur="4.53">may not want to pray for someone to be</text>
  <text start="823.33" dur="5.52">healed so in this dream I was praying</text>
  <text start="826.18" dur="4.02">for three people to be healed and I was</text>
  <text start="828.85" dur="3.12">in it in a hospital I was in the</text>
  <text start="830.2" dur="4.17">emergency department I was praying for</text>
  <text start="831.97" dur="5.49">the the ER doctor who had I think</text>
  <text start="834.37" dur="5.22">arthritis in his elbow I prayed for a</text>
  <text start="837.46" dur="4.5">baby and I don&amp;#39;t remember what the baby</text>
  <text start="839.59" dur="5.7">had and I prayed for a third person now</text>
  <text start="841.96" dur="6.57">in this dream I&amp;#39;m praying for them to be</text>
  <text start="845.29" dur="5.64">healed but I&amp;#39;m also asking God to bring</text>
  <text start="848.53" dur="8.61">his glory to bring his presence and</text>
  <text start="850.93" dur="8.79">touch them and in the dream I knew that</text>
  <text start="857.14" dur="5.91">the main goal that God wanted to</text>
  <text start="859.72" dur="7.55">accomplish was not healing it was</text>
  <text start="863.05" dur="7.07">allowing them to feel his presence</text>
  <text start="867.27" dur="9.1">getting them healed was secondary</text>
  <text start="870.12" dur="7.84">many of us have as our agenda we want</text>
  <text start="876.37" dur="4.89">the person to be healed or we want</text>
  <text start="877.96" dur="5.46">ourselves to be healed many times God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="881.26" dur="4.56">agenda is I want them to feel my</text>
  <text start="883.42" dur="5.04">presence don&amp;#39;t worry about the healing I</text>
  <text start="885.82" dur="4.77">want them to feel my presence I want</text>
  <text start="888.46" dur="4.29">them to know I&amp;#39;m real I wanted them to</text>
  <text start="890.59" dur="3.9">know that I care about them I want to</text>
  <text start="892.75" dur="2.52">touch them with my presence that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="894.49" dur="3.75">main thing</text>
  <text start="895.27" dur="5.79">healing is secondary so if you are a</text>
  <text start="898.24" dur="5.55">person who prays for people to be healed</text>
  <text start="901.06" dur="5.82">and you&amp;#39;re worried what are we gonna do</text>
  <text start="903.79" dur="5.28">if they&amp;#39;re not healed take consolation</text>
  <text start="906.88" dur="6.09">in the fact that healing isn&amp;#39;t always</text>
  <text start="909.07" dur="6.15">the main objective sometimes introducing</text>
  <text start="912.97" dur="5.13">them to the God&amp;#39;s presence is the main</text>
  <text start="915.22" dur="5.18">thing healing is secondary so what I do</text>
  <text start="918.1" dur="4.89">is when I pray for people to be healed</text>
  <text start="920.4" dur="4.81">the first thing I say is Lord bring your</text>
  <text start="922.99" dur="5.61">glory bring your presence it&amp;#39;s first</text>
  <text start="925.21" dur="6.15">thing I do I just say Lord bring your</text>
  <text start="928.6" dur="5.04">presence bring your glory and many times</text>
  <text start="931.36" dur="5.31">I will just say Lord bring your glory</text>
  <text start="933.64" dur="5.58">bring your presence and I will continue</text>
  <text start="936.67" dur="7.43">asking him to bring his presence until I</text>
  <text start="939.22" dur="8.19">feel his glory when I start to sway a</text>
  <text start="944.1" dur="5.62">little bit but I feel a little giddy a</text>
  <text start="947.41" dur="4.11">little bit lightheaded then I know ok</text>
  <text start="949.72" dur="3.48">God&amp;#39;s glory is here</text>
  <text start="951.52" dur="5.82">I&amp;#39;m feeling it they&amp;#39;re probably feeling</text>
  <text start="953.2" dur="8.7">it too and then I go into power and</text>
  <text start="957.34" dur="7.8">authority because you know look if you</text>
  <text start="961.9" dur="6.21">can get somebody healed simply by asking</text>
  <text start="965.14" dur="5.43">God to bring his glory and you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="968.11" dur="3.78">have to exercise authority you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="970.57" dur="2.58">have to release power you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="971.89" dur="3.66">do emotional healing you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="973.15" dur="4.5">kick out any demons the whole process is</text>
  <text start="975.55" dur="3.99">a lot easier if you can just ask God to</text>
  <text start="977.65" dur="5.94">bring his glory and his glory might</text>
  <text start="979.54" dur="8.58">actually heal them so that is why I do</text>
  <text start="983.59" dur="6.69">that first and when you watch me pray if</text>
  <text start="988.12" dur="4.2">you see me pray for people you&amp;#39;ll always</text>
  <text start="990.28" dur="4.35">hear me say Lord bring your glory bring</text>
  <text start="992.32" dur="4.53">your presence and Denise well look at me</text>
  <text start="994.63" dur="5.28">like okay I gotta make sure I can stand</text>
  <text start="996.85" dur="5.25">because sometimes sometimes the weight</text>
  <text start="999.91" dur="4.5">over his glory will push her down and</text>
  <text start="1002.1" dur="3.39">she&amp;#39;ll start her knees will start to get</text>
  <text start="1004.41" dur="3.96">weak and she&amp;#39;ll have a hard time</text>
  <text start="1005.49" dur="4.38">standing it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="1008.37" dur="3.21">double-edged sword it&amp;#39;s like she knows</text>
  <text start="1009.87" dur="3.6">it&amp;#39;s coming if she hears we say God</text>
  <text start="1011.58" dur="3.96">bring your glory she&amp;#39;s like okay I</text>
  <text start="1013.47" dur="4.2">better sit down or get ready to because</text>
  <text start="1015.54" dur="4.98">it&amp;#39;s gonna hit in a minute I don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="1017.67" dur="4.29">to end up on the floor I&amp;#39;d like to just</text>
  <text start="1020.52" dur="4.83">give you one more scripture reference</text>
  <text start="1021.96" dur="5.73">real quick and this is John 17 now in</text>
  <text start="1025.35" dur="4.47">John 17 it&amp;#39;s actually Denise&amp;#39;s favorite</text>
  <text start="1027.69" dur="5.1">chapter in the Bible it is the prayer</text>
  <text start="1029.82" dur="7.08">where Jesus is praying to the Father and</text>
  <text start="1032.79" dur="6.99">he is communicating with the father</text>
  <text start="1036.9" dur="5.309">about oneness about how he is one with a</text>
  <text start="1039.78" dur="5.52">father and how his prayer is that we</text>
  <text start="1042.209" dur="5.371">would be one with each other and one</text>
  <text start="1045.3" dur="7.53">with God so it&amp;#39;s the prayer of oneness</text>
  <text start="1047.58" dur="9.87">in John 17 in verse 22 and 23 this is</text>
  <text start="1052.83" dur="9.75">what Jesus says and the glory which you</text>
  <text start="1057.45" dur="10.23">gave me I have given them that they may</text>
  <text start="1062.58" dur="8.64">be one as we are one I in them you in me</text>
  <text start="1067.68" dur="6.24">that they may be made perfect in one and</text>
  <text start="1071.22" dur="6.12">that the world may know that you sent me</text>
  <text start="1073.92" dur="6.69">and that I have loved them as you have</text>
  <text start="1077.34" dur="6.15">loved me so Jesus is talking to the</text>
  <text start="1080.61" dur="4.65">father and is saying my prayer is that</text>
  <text start="1083.49" dur="5.64">they would be one</text>
  <text start="1085.26" dur="6.75">the way we are won and that they would</text>
  <text start="1089.13" dur="7.44">know you love them the way you love me</text>
  <text start="1092.01" dur="7.23">so God the Father loves you the exact</text>
  <text start="1096.57" dur="5.94">same way he loves his son did you know</text>
  <text start="1099.24" dur="7.529">that did you know that God the Father</text>
  <text start="1102.51" dur="8.58">loves you in the same way he loves his</text>
  <text start="1106.769" dur="7.321">son Jesus if you did not know that you</text>
  <text start="1111.09" dur="6.449">know it now and part of the way that</text>
  <text start="1114.09" dur="6.51">that God wants you to know that is that</text>
  <text start="1117.539" dur="7.73">you would understand that God has given</text>
  <text start="1120.6" dur="9.299">you his glory jesus said that glory</text>
  <text start="1125.269" dur="7.15">which you gave to me I give to them so</text>
  <text start="1129.899" dur="6.181">we have the glory of God because Jesus</text>
  <text start="1132.419" dur="7.801">said you Father you gave me your glory</text>
  <text start="1136.08" dur="7.16">and I&amp;#39;m giving it to them so not only do</text>
  <text start="1140.22" dur="5.49">we have the Holy Spirit right Jesus said</text>
  <text start="1143.24" dur="3.88">when you receive the Holy Spirit you</text>
  <text start="1145.71" dur="4.23">will be endued with power from on high</text>
  <text start="1147.12" dur="6.84">we also have God&amp;#39;s glory we&amp;#39;re carriers</text>
  <text start="1149.94" dur="6.51">of God&amp;#39;s glory so what I&amp;#39;m doing when</text>
  <text start="1153.96" dur="5.91">I&amp;#39;m praying for people to feel God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1156.45" dur="5.4">glory to feel his presence is it&amp;#39;s I</text>
  <text start="1159.87" dur="5.13">haven&amp;#39;t actually understood if we</text>
  <text start="1161.85" dur="5.579">release God&amp;#39;s glory or if he brings his</text>
  <text start="1165" dur="5.19">glory from out there in heaven I&amp;#39;m not</text>
  <text start="1167.429" dur="4.35">exactly sure how it works he hasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1170.19" dur="3.41">shown me a diagram on a little</text>
  <text start="1171.779" dur="5.701">whiteboard about what that looks like</text>
  <text start="1173.6" dur="6.16">but the point is whether we&amp;#39;re releasing</text>
  <text start="1177.48" dur="4.199">power or whether we&amp;#39;re releasing God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1179.76" dur="5.1">glory or whether God is bringing his</text>
  <text start="1181.679" dur="7.051">glory into the room God&amp;#39;s glory his</text>
  <text start="1184.86" dur="5.909">presence is very powerful it can change</text>
  <text start="1188.73" dur="4.439">people&amp;#39;s lives and that was the point of</text>
  <text start="1190.769" dur="5.13">that one dream God wanted me to</text>
  <text start="1193.169" dur="5.581">understand look sometimes all I want</text>
  <text start="1195.899" dur="7.231">them to do is feel my glory is feel my</text>
  <text start="1198.75" dur="7.86">presence God&amp;#39;s glory I see it sort of as</text>
  <text start="1203.13" dur="6.06">another tool for healing we have a lot</text>
  <text start="1206.61" dur="4.14">of tools now me and my friends have</text>
  <text start="1209.19" dur="4.709">gotten together from time to time over</text>
  <text start="1210.75" dur="5.37">the years and we have glory parties some</text>
  <text start="1213.899" dur="3.541">of my friends and I when I was living in</text>
  <text start="1216.12" dur="2.76">Washington we would do that pretty</text>
  <text start="1217.44" dur="4.29">regularly we get together</text>
  <text start="1218.88" dur="4.92">eat drink have a good time but we would</text>
  <text start="1221.73" dur="4.32">have these glory parties where we would</text>
  <text start="1223.8" dur="4.41">people would have instruments Todd would</text>
  <text start="1226.05" dur="5.49">bring his a drum few people would bring</text>
  <text start="1228.21" dur="4.8">guitars and we&amp;#39;d start playing and we</text>
  <text start="1231.54" dur="4.11">would do a little bit of worship and</text>
  <text start="1233.01" dur="6.03">pretty soon the glory was in the house</text>
  <text start="1235.65" dur="5.81">and when the glory would come strong and</text>
  <text start="1239.04" dur="5.4">when God&amp;#39;s glory comes heavy and strong</text>
  <text start="1241.46" dur="5.53">some people start to laugh and giggle</text>
  <text start="1244.44" dur="4.59">and act as if they&amp;#39;re drunk okay</text>
  <text start="1246.99" dur="4.61">some people stagger and stumble around</text>
  <text start="1249.03" dur="4.83">some people collapse and pass out</text>
  <text start="1251.6" dur="5.62">Gloria parties can be very interesting</text>
  <text start="1253.86" dur="5.97">Michael King I remember many often times</text>
  <text start="1257.22" dur="5.19">in the glory Michael would pray for</text>
  <text start="1259.83" dur="4.83">people and gold dust would manifest on</text>
  <text start="1262.41" dur="5.34">their hands manifestations of God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1264.66" dur="5.64">presence Goldust when you have these</text>
  <text start="1267.75" dur="6.39">glory parties some very strange things</text>
  <text start="1270.3" dur="4.32">can happen people&amp;#39;s hands will flow with</text>
  <text start="1274.14" dur="2.43">oil</text>
  <text start="1274.62" dur="5.94">they&amp;#39;ll have gold dust on their hands</text>
