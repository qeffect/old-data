  <text start="8.66" dur="5.68">hi there welcome to my youtube channel</text>
  <text start="11.4" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;m your host brain medic I&amp;#39;m gonna be</text>
  <text start="14.34" dur="3.63">teaching you some of the basics of</text>
  <text start="15.78" dur="4.38">healing based on my book divine healing</text>
  <text start="17.97" dur="6.319">made simple which can be purchased on</text>
  <text start="20.16" dur="4.129">amazon.com or on my website</text>
  <text start="34" dur="2.06">you</text>
  <text start="37.219" dur="4.721">hey there welcome to today&amp;#39;s message</text>
  <text start="39.829" dur="6.55">today I&amp;#39;m going to be talking to you</text>
  <text start="41.94" dur="6.509">about a common misconception that exists</text>
  <text start="46.379" dur="5.1">about divine healing and that</text>
  <text start="48.449" dur="5.85">misconception is the idea that healing</text>
  <text start="51.479" dur="5.271">and miracles ceased in the first century</text>
  <text start="54.299" dur="5.881">with the death of the original apostles</text>
  <text start="56.75" dur="5.769">this idea which is called cessationism</text>
  <text start="60.18" dur="5.729">has been around for a long time it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="62.519" dur="5.481">really new the reason that some people</text>
  <text start="65.909" dur="5.13">believe healing and miracles have ceased</text>
  <text start="68" dur="6.28">is mainly because they haven&amp;#39;t seen</text>
  <text start="71.039" dur="5.881">miracles happen themselves after I</text>
  <text start="74.28" dur="4.71">became a Christian I was a cessationist</text>
  <text start="76.92" dur="3.479">for many years I didn&amp;#39;t believe in</text>
  <text start="78.99" dur="3.96">healing or miracles I&amp;#39;d never seen a</text>
  <text start="80.399" dur="4.83">healing miracle never seen anything</text>
  <text start="82.95" dur="5.07">actual manifestations of the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="85.229" dur="4.5">and because I had never seen anything</text>
  <text start="88.02" dur="4.56">firsthand never witnessed anything</text>
  <text start="89.729" dur="6.03">miraculous it was easy for me to believe</text>
  <text start="92.58" dur="5.7">that healing miracles and the gifts of</text>
  <text start="95.759" dur="4.261">the Holy Spirit had ceased but a few</text>
  <text start="98.28" dur="3.81">years ago I started seeing miracles and</text>
  <text start="100.02" dur="4.409">he only happened pretty regularly and</text>
  <text start="102.09" dur="6.419">that made me rethink the way that I</text>
  <text start="104.429" dur="7.291">understood God one of the foundational</text>
  <text start="108.509" dur="6">points of the belief that healing and</text>
  <text start="111.72" dur="5.37">miracles have ceased is the idea that</text>
  <text start="114.509" dur="6.631">once the Canon of Scripture was</text>
  <text start="117.09" dur="6.389">collected and was widely available it</text>
  <text start="121.14" dur="4.11">was no longer necessary to have healing</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="4.68">and miracles to confirm the preaching of</text>
  <text start="125.25" dur="4.92">the message of the gospel this is a</text>
  <text start="128.159" dur="5.521">common belief but it isn&amp;#39;t found</text>
  <text start="130.17" dur="6.27">anywhere in the Bible itself contrary to</text>
  <text start="133.68" dur="6.779">this idea that healing would be a</text>
  <text start="136.44" dur="6.689">temporary show of God&amp;#39;s power during the</text>
  <text start="140.459" dur="4.591">first century Jesus made it pretty clear</text>
  <text start="143.129" dur="5.22">to his disciples that he expected them</text>
  <text start="145.05" dur="5.04">to heal the sick raise the dead cast out</text>
  <text start="148.349" dur="4.771">demons and proclaim the kingdom and</text>
  <text start="150.09" dur="5.1">there was no suggestion that anywhere in</text>
  <text start="153.12" dur="3.6">the in the gospels or anywhere in the</text>
  <text start="155.19" dur="5.25">New Testament that healing would ever</text>
  <text start="156.72" dur="7.28">end one of the arguments used by people</text>
  <text start="160.44" dur="6.87">who believed that healing is ceased is</text>
  <text start="164" dur="6.52">Paul&amp;#39;s throne in the flesh this isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="5.4">some straw man that I&amp;#39;m putting up</text>
  <text start="170.52" dur="5.24">an argument actually Paul Stern in the</text>
  <text start="172.71" dur="7.22">flush is one of the most hotly debated</text>
  <text start="175.76" dur="8.28">issues in Christianity and it refers to</text>
  <text start="179.93" dur="6.16">Paul&amp;#39;s commentary in 2nd Corinthians 12</text>
  <text start="184.04" dur="5.2">or he said he was talking about</text>
  <text start="186.09" dur="4.83">persecution in this chapter and he wrote</text>
  <text start="189.24" dur="3.69">and lest I should be exalted above</text>
  <text start="190.92" dur="4.2">measure by the abundance of the</text>
  <text start="192.93" dur="4.32">revelations a thorn in the flesh was</text>
  <text start="195.12" dur="2.61">given to me a messenger of Satan to buff</text>
  <text start="197.25" dur="4.23">at me</text>
  <text start="197.73" dur="5.25">lest I be exalted above measure now</text>
  <text start="201.48" dur="3.66">cessationist would argue that Paul&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.98" dur="4.53">turn in the flesh was some form of</text>
  <text start="205.14" dur="5.13">sickness that he asked God to remove and</text>
  <text start="207.51" dur="4.92">God refused to do it from this they</text>
  <text start="210.27" dur="5.25">argue that God may actually want us to</text>
  <text start="212.43" dur="4.71">be sick for whatever reason there are</text>
  <text start="215.52" dur="4.65">several problems with this line of</text>
  <text start="217.14" dur="4.98">reasoning the first is that as I</text>
  <text start="220.17" dur="3.48">mentioned earlier sickness isn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="222.12" dur="4.14">actually discussed anywhere in this</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="4.5">chapter Paul was illustrating his</text>
  <text start="226.26" dur="4.62">teaching on persecution with a personal</text>
  <text start="228.15" dur="4.68">example focusing briefly on the</text>
  <text start="230.88" dur="4.35">persecution he suffered because of the</text>
  <text start="232.83" dur="4.5">revelation he received from God he wrote</text>
  <text start="235.23" dur="5.46">that in order for him to keep from being</text>
  <text start="237.33" dur="6.93">exalted to highly God allowed Satan to</text>
  <text start="240.69" dur="5.91">send a messenger to harass him there is</text>
  <text start="244.26" dur="5.4">no mention of sickness if you look at</text>
  <text start="246.6" dur="5.28">the Greek text here the messenger that</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="4.65">Paul referred to was not a form of</text>
  <text start="251.88" dur="6">sickness the Greek word for messenger is</text>
  <text start="254.31" dur="5.1">typically translated angel the obvious</text>
  <text start="257.88" dur="4.169">meaning of this passage would be that</text>
  <text start="259.41" dur="4.74">Satan sent a fallen angel or maybe a</text>
  <text start="262.049" dur="4.351">demon and God permitted it to keep him</text>
  <text start="264.15" dur="3.81">humble but there isn&amp;#39;t any reason to</text>
  <text start="266.4" dur="3.15">believe that this passage supports the</text>
  <text start="267.96" dur="4.47">idea that God would not heal him of</text>
  <text start="269.55" dur="4.95">sickness the other argument that&amp;#39;s used</text>
  <text start="272.43" dur="4.05">against healing is the observation that</text>
  <text start="274.5" dur="3.57">sickness was present among early church</text>
  <text start="276.48" dur="4.65">leaders such as Paul Timothy and</text>
  <text start="278.07" dur="4.8">Epaphroditus now a cessationists will</text>
  <text start="281.13" dur="4.32">point to the presence of sickness and</text>
  <text start="282.87" dur="4.92">say that well you see here these people</text>
  <text start="285.45" dur="5.25">were sick therefore God wasn&amp;#39;t healing</text>
  <text start="287.79" dur="5.22">people and that as the Apostolic age</text>
  <text start="290.7" dur="5.969">came to a close healing and miracles</text>
  <text start="293.01" dur="6.15">ceased well let&amp;#39;s look at what these</text>
  <text start="296.669" dur="4.201">passages actually say the mention of a</text>
  <text start="299.16" dur="5.07">Pafford itis is found in Philippians</text>
  <text start="300.87" dur="5.58">chapter 2 yet I considered</text>
  <text start="304.23" dur="4.74">necessary to send you up afroditi is my</text>
  <text start="306.45" dur="4.65">brother fellow worker and fellow soldier</text>
  <text start="308.97" dur="4.35">but your messenger and the one who</text>
  <text start="311.1" dur="5.25">ministered to my need since he was</text>
  <text start="313.32" dur="4.95">longing for you and was distressed</text>
  <text start="316.35" dur="4.56">because you had heard that he was sick</text>
  <text start="318.27" dur="5.25">for indeed he was sick almost unto death</text>
  <text start="320.91" dur="5.01">but God had mercy on him and not only on</text>
  <text start="323.52" dur="3.71">him but on me also lest I should have</text>
  <text start="325.92" dur="3.78">sorrow upon sorrow</text>
  <text start="327.23" dur="4.39">therefore I sent him the more eagerly</text>
  <text start="329.7" dur="5.37">that when you see him again you may</text>
  <text start="331.62" dur="4.83">rejoice and I may be less sorrowful now</text>
  <text start="335.07" dur="4.35">it&amp;#39;s clear from this passage that</text>
  <text start="336.45" dur="4.97">epaphroditus was indeed sick but if you</text>
  <text start="339.42" dur="4.83">want to know whether healing had ceased</text>
  <text start="341.42" dur="5.47">you should determine first if hip</text>
  <text start="344.25" dur="4.95">Aphrodite&amp;#39;s was healed or not so after</text>
  <text start="346.89" dur="5.82">describing his sickness in verse 27 Paul</text>
  <text start="349.2" dur="6.3">says but God had mercy on him well what</text>
  <text start="352.71" dur="5.67">did Paul mean by this comment we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="355.5" dur="5.16">know for sure but the tone suggests that</text>
  <text start="358.38" dur="5.7">there was an unexpected outcome hape</text>
  <text start="360.66" dur="5.76">Aphrodite&amp;#39;s was sick but God had mercy</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="4.65">on him the natural conclusion you would</text>
  <text start="366.42" dur="4.17">come to was that epaphroditus was</text>
  <text start="368.73" dur="4.56">actually healed after his sickness</text>
  <text start="370.59" dur="5.04">because of God&amp;#39;s mercy Paul then writes</text>
  <text start="373.29" dur="4.56">that he&amp;#39;s sent Epaphroditus so that the</text>
  <text start="375.63" dur="5.28">believers in Philippi might rejoice when</text>
  <text start="377.85" dur="5.76">they saw him why would Paul send a</text>
  <text start="380.91" dur="4.38">friend to other believers who was nearly</text>
  <text start="383.61" dur="3.84">dead thinking that would cause them to</text>
  <text start="385.29" dur="4.2">rejoice it doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense</text>
  <text start="387.45" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s likely that Epaphroditus was</text>
  <text start="389.49" dur="4.74">actually healed now let&amp;#39;s look at</text>
  <text start="391.56" dur="6.33">Timothy&amp;#39;s illness which Paul mentions in</text>
  <text start="394.23" dur="5.88">first Timothy chapter 5 no longer drink</text>
  <text start="397.89" dur="3.87">water but use a little wine for your</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="5.22">stomach&amp;#39;s sake and for your frequent</text>
  <text start="401.76" dur="5.7">infirmities now in this brief passage</text>
  <text start="405.33" dur="5.01">Paul notes that Timothy&amp;#39;s infirmities</text>
  <text start="407.46" dur="4.23">were a result of drinking only water we</text>
  <text start="410.34" dur="3.51">don&amp;#39;t know the reason why the water he</text>
  <text start="411.69" dur="3.39">drank made him sick it&amp;#39;s possible that</text>
  <text start="413.85" dur="3.03">it was contaminated it might have had</text>
  <text start="415.08" dur="4.14">some kind of bacteria in it they gave an</text>
  <text start="416.88" dur="4.35">infection but Paul&amp;#39;s antidote was to</text>
  <text start="419.22" dur="3.57">have him drink a little wine the</text>
  <text start="421.23" dur="4.29">infirmities weren&amp;#39;t severe enough that</text>
  <text start="422.79" dur="4.86">they required healing Paul simply tells</text>
  <text start="425.52" dur="4.95">Timothy hey drink a little bit of wine</text>
  <text start="427.65" dur="4.95">and they&amp;#39;ll go away it&amp;#39;s simply a case</text>
  <text start="430.47" dur="4.23">of an older and wiser man instructing a</text>
  <text start="432.6" dur="4.47">younger one to take some practical steps</text>
  <text start="434.7" dur="4.11">to avoid becoming sick</text>
  <text start="437.07" dur="3.63">the New Testament doesn&amp;#39;t actually show</text>
  <text start="438.81" dur="4.89">a decrease in the effectiveness of</text>
  <text start="440.7" dur="4.53">healing as critics say that it does the</text>
  <text start="443.7" dur="4.02">disciples were still healing all who</text>
  <text start="445.23" dur="4.59">were sick and demon-possessed who came</text>
  <text start="447.72" dur="5.6">to them which was recorded in Acts</text>
  <text start="449.82" dur="5.85">chapter 5 verses 14 through 16 and</text>
  <text start="453.32" dur="4.96">believers are increasingly added to the</text>
  <text start="455.67" dur="4.11">Lord multitudes of both men and women so</text>
  <text start="458.28" dur="2.88">that they brought the sick into the</text>
  <text start="459.78" dur="4.41">streets and laid them on the beds and</text>
  <text start="461.16" dur="5.61">couches that at least the shadow of</text>
  <text start="464.19" dur="4.26">Peter passing by might fall on them also</text>
  <text start="466.77" dur="3.45">a multitude gathered from the</text>
  <text start="468.45" dur="3.51">surrounding cities to Jerusalem bringing</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="4.26">sick people and those who are tormented</text>
  <text start="471.96" dur="5.25">by unclean spirits and they were all</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="5.76">healed this is exactly what we saw Jesus</text>
  <text start="477.21" dur="4.8">doing in the Gospels here go to villages</text>
  <text start="480.24" dur="3.78">and towns and the entire city would be</text>
  <text start="482.01" dur="5.07">healed of all their diseases all the</text>
  <text start="484.02" dur="5.88">demons cast out so in the book of Acts</text>
  <text start="487.08" dur="4.71">after Jesus ascended into heaven the</text>
  <text start="489.9" dur="3.78">disciples are still following the</text>
  <text start="491.79" dur="4.41">commission that Jesus gave them to go</text>
  <text start="493.68" dur="4.89">out heal the sick and cast out demons in</text>
  <text start="496.2" dur="4.71">response to the argument that sickness</text>
  <text start="498.57" dur="4.53">in the church suggests that God wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="500.91" dur="4.98">healing anymore I would like to make</text>
  <text start="503.1" dur="5.01">this observation I know hundreds of</text>
  <text start="505.89" dur="3.84">people who successfully operate in</text>
  <text start="508.11" dur="4.14">healing today from all around the world</text>
  <text start="509.73" dur="4.23">just about every one of them suffers</text>
  <text start="512.25" dur="4.05">from some kind of sickness once in a</text>
  <text start="513.96" dur="4.62">while including myself the presence of</text>
  <text start="516.3" dur="4.26">sickness among a group of people doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="518.58" dur="4.68">prove that healing isn&amp;#39;t also happening</text>
  <text start="520.56" dur="6.18">among them actually in order for healing</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="6.24">to occur sickness has to be present if</text>
  <text start="526.74" dur="5.4">healing ceased in the first century then</text>
  <text start="529.5" dur="4.41">you have to explain why thousands</text>
  <text start="532.14" dur="5.07">perhaps hundreds of thousands of people</text>
  <text start="533.91" dur="4.77">a year are miraculously healed and those</text>
  <text start="537.21" dur="4.89">healings are attested to by their</text>
  <text start="538.68" dur="6.03">doctors the last objection that I&amp;#39;d like</text>
  <text start="542.1" dur="5.37">to address here is the assertion from</text>
  <text start="544.71" dur="5.04">cessationists that healing was only</text>
  <text start="547.47" dur="5.43">intended as a means of supporting the</text>
  <text start="549.75" dur="5.37">spread of the gospel while healing and</text>
  <text start="552.9" dur="4.61">miracles did support the spread of the</text>
  <text start="555.12" dur="5.1">gospel that isn&amp;#39;t their only purpose</text>
  <text start="557.51" dur="5.38">healing is a tangible demonstration of</text>
  <text start="560.22" dur="4.32">God&amp;#39;s love mercy and compassion it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="562.89" dur="4.32">means of spiritual warfare against the</text>
  <text start="564.54" dur="4.14">kingdom of darkness it is a way to make</text>
  <text start="567.21" dur="3.51">people spiritually physically and</text>
  <text start="568.68" dur="4.409">emotionally whole and it brings to</text>
  <text start="570.72" dur="4.89">pull into a relationship with God all of</text>
  <text start="573.089" dur="5.661">those things are still necessary in the</text>
  <text start="575.61" dur="5.579">modern era thus healing has never ceased</text>
  <text start="578.75" dur="5.019">if you&amp;#39;re a believer you can heal the</text>
  <text start="581.189" dur="4.71">sick too all it takes is little faith in</text>
