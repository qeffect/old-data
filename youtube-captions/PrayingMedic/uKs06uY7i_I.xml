  <text start="88.869" dur="5.101">them to basically step out of their</text>
  <text start="91.899" dur="5.22">comfort zone and quit their job not to</text>
  <text start="93.97" dur="5.099">ask for donations and just trust that</text>
  <text start="97.119" dur="5.28">God is going to provide that&amp;#39;s a very</text>
  <text start="99.069" dur="6.841">difficult thing to do I was in that spot</text>
  <text start="102.399" dur="4.95">about 10 years ago and I didn&amp;#39;t have a</text>
  <text start="105.91" dur="3.599">choice</text>
  <text start="107.349" dur="4.44">it wasn&amp;#39;t like God said I want you to</text>
  <text start="109.509" dur="3.931">quit your job I got fired for my job I</text>
  <text start="111.789" dur="4.801">mean actually what happened was I got</text>
  <text start="113.44" dur="6.299">suspended without pay for 16 months and</text>
  <text start="116.59" dur="4.83">while I was on suspension I was I was a</text>
  <text start="119.739" dur="5.071">hot potato and nobody wanted to hire me</text>
  <text start="121.42" dur="7.38">I could not get a job to save my life so</text>
  <text start="124.81" dur="7.14">for almost a year and a half God taught</text>
  <text start="128.8" dur="5.46">me that he was my provider I was of the</text>
  <text start="131.95" dur="5.91">mindset that I have to make it work that</text>
  <text start="134.26" dur="6.6">I have to be the provider that it&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="137.86" dur="6.12">up to me to provide for my family during</text>
  <text start="140.86" dur="5.459">that time God was teaching me no I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="143.98" dur="4.79">your provider and I&amp;#39;m gonna cut off all</text>
  <text start="146.319" dur="4.971">your resources right now for a while too</text>
  <text start="148.77" dur="5.64">teach you that I can provide for you now</text>
  <text start="151.29" dur="6.36">after that season was done then things</text>
  <text start="154.41" dur="4.68">started to change and more and more</text>
  <text start="157.65" dur="4.86">opportunities have come open over the</text>
  <text start="159.09" dur="5.1">last few years for us to make income</text>
  <text start="162.51" dur="6.99">through our different creative abilities</text>
  <text start="164.19" dur="7.98">so some people have this time where God</text>
  <text start="169.5" dur="5.58">says this is not about money this is not</text>
  <text start="172.17" dur="4.71">about you trying to be successful are</text>
  <text start="175.08" dur="4.26">you trying to make it on your own</text>
  <text start="176.88" dur="5.22">strength you have to learn that lesson</text>
  <text start="179.34" dur="5.24">that he&amp;#39;s your provider first I think</text>
  <text start="182.1" dur="4.8">and then the doors of opportunity open</text>
  <text start="184.58" dur="3.28">yeah and I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s like that</text>
  <text start="186.9" dur="3.24">for everyone</text>
  <text start="187.86" dur="4.8">it definitely was like that for you and</text>
  <text start="190.14" dur="6.12">we we know friends some friends who were</text>
  <text start="192.66" dur="6.06">directly told by God not to ask for</text>
  <text start="196.26" dur="4.92">donations not to earn money for</text>
  <text start="198.72" dur="5.1">themselves and we&amp;#39;re not in that</text>
  <text start="201.18" dur="4.44">position now yeah we&amp;#39;re done and and how</text>
  <text start="203.82" dur="4.47">that works out with each person is gonna</text>
  <text start="205.62" dur="4.32">be different I&amp;#39;m just trying to let</text>
  <text start="208.29" dur="4.29">people know that you can&amp;#39;t necessarily</text>
  <text start="209.94" dur="4.41">follow one model or one set of</text>
  <text start="212.58" dur="4.05">expectations because God will work</text>
  <text start="214.35" dur="4.8">differently with each person yeah and</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="4.8">another way that we&amp;#39;ve done it is like</text>
  <text start="219.15" dur="4.92">trying to transition out of one thing</text>
  <text start="221.43" dur="5.73">and into something else you know if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="224.07" dur="6.21">too big of a leap to just quit your job</text>
  <text start="227.16" dur="5.61">and do the new thing you know you can</text>
  <text start="230.28" dur="5.91">let go of it gradually which is what I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="232.77" dur="7.14">trying to do and I&amp;#39;m doing right now and</text>
  <text start="236.19" dur="6.72">I would say it&amp;#39;s working out so far I</text>
  <text start="239.91" dur="4.86">think when we make the complete</text>
  <text start="242.91" dur="3.78">transition we&amp;#39;re gonna be okay</text>
  <text start="244.77" dur="6.42">plus we have a lot of ideas written down</text>
  <text start="246.69" dur="6.269">there so far our number one number two</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="6.33">ideas is crash and burn we have more</text>
  <text start="252.959" dur="6.391">ideas you know there&amp;#39;s all this talk of</text>
  <text start="257.52" dur="4.92">economic collapse I don&amp;#39;t know what</text>
  <text start="259.35" dur="5.49">happens to book buying I would assume</text>
  <text start="262.44" dur="5.37">that that&amp;#39;s not as important as food</text>
  <text start="264.84" dur="4.23">when there&amp;#39;s an economic collapse so I</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="4.08">think it is important to have other</text>
  <text start="269.07" dur="3.51">ideas of how you&amp;#39;re going to earn a</text>
  <text start="271.89" dur="2.94">living</text>
  <text start="272.58" dur="4.44">you know if you&amp;#39;re relying on one</text>
  <text start="274.83" dur="4.5">actually when we were reading the diary</text>
  <text start="277.02" dur="3.149">of that guy from Argentina during the</text>
  <text start="279.33" dur="2.55">economic collapse</text>
  <text start="280.169" dur="4.561">he said books</text>
  <text start="281.88" dur="4.71">were huge because people were sitting in</text>
  <text start="284.73" dur="6.57">their homes and apartments with nothing</text>
  <text start="286.59" dur="7.56">to do but chefs a surprisingly enough</text>
  <text start="291.3" dur="4.86">entertainment was huge remember because</text>
  <text start="294.15" dur="5.43">at the black markets the big sellers</text>
  <text start="296.16" dur="5.55">were DVDs and videos and CDs and books</text>
  <text start="299.58" dur="4.92">yeah but this won&amp;#39;t be on Amazon right</text>
  <text start="301.71" dur="5.37">this would be on your street corner it</text>
  <text start="304.5" dur="4.43">might be I don&amp;#39;t know I mean it depends</text>
  <text start="307.08" dur="4.62">if we have another economic downturn</text>
  <text start="308.93" dur="3.94">maybe people won&amp;#39;t be entertaining as</text>
  <text start="311.7" dur="2.91">much and maybe they&amp;#39;ll be looking for</text>
  <text start="312.87" dur="2.97">you know cheap entertainment at home</text>
  <text start="314.61" dur="3.27">instead of home and read your Kindle</text>
  <text start="315.84" dur="4.14">books I don&amp;#39;t know yeah but God has</text>
  <text start="317.88" dur="3.93">really really been speaking to me a lot</text>
  <text start="319.98" dur="5.25">about people writing books like I had</text>
  <text start="321.81" dur="6.23">that dream right a month ago where God</text>
  <text start="325.23" dur="6.12">had given a group of people a very</text>
  <text start="328.04" dur="5.08">unusual anointing to write books and to</text>
  <text start="331.35" dur="3.75">write a lot of books in a short period</text>
  <text start="333.12" dur="5.07">of time and to become very prolific</text>
  <text start="335.1" dur="4.59">writers and if he was gonna pull the rug</text>
  <text start="338.19" dur="3.06">out from underneath our feet I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="339.69" dur="4.53">know why he would give us a dream about</text>
  <text start="341.25" dur="5.79">writing a lot of books and Billy had</text>
  <text start="344.22" dur="5.52">another prophetic word where God was</text>
  <text start="347.04" dur="4.92">releasing angels to help artists and</text>
  <text start="349.74" dur="4.98">musicians and writers get their work out</text>
  <text start="351.96" dur="4.44">and become very prolific and so this is</text>
  <text start="354.72" dur="4.14">I think a really good season for</text>
  <text start="356.4" dur="5.49">creative people to put the wood to the</text>
  <text start="358.86" dur="5.22">fire to get your content out there start</text>
  <text start="361.89" dur="4.53">painting get your stuff ready get your</text>
  <text start="364.08" dur="4.53">books written get your music recording</text>
  <text start="366.42" dur="4.14">you know like for recording it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="368.61" dur="3.78">have to be anything great here&amp;#39;s the the</text>
  <text start="370.56" dur="4.89">cool thing about right now is it has</text>
  <text start="372.39" dur="6.21">never been easier to make a living from</text>
  <text start="375.45" dur="5.28">home as a creative person decades ago if</text>
  <text start="378.6" dur="4.08">you were an artist you had to go out to</text>
  <text start="380.73" dur="4.74">shows or head to beginning galleries</text>
  <text start="382.68" dur="5.58">mm-hmm there was nobody really making it</text>
  <text start="385.47" dur="4.62">as an artist from home online putting</text>
  <text start="388.26" dur="5.43">their artwork up on websites and stuff</text>

  <text start="465.78" dur="4.13">ago you have had to go to someplace yeah</text>
  <text start="471.02" dur="6.58">I know when I first got out of art</text>
  <text start="474.48" dur="6.18">school I was I was such an introvert</text>
  <text start="477.6" dur="8.52">then I mean I was a shy introverted</text>
  <text start="480.66" dur="7.77">person and I just could not imagine</text>
  <text start="486.12" dur="3.95">myself taking my work around to</text>
  <text start="488.43" dur="4.77">galleries and possibly getting rejected</text>
  <text start="490.07" dur="5.74">so I didn&amp;#39;t you know did you have fear</text>
  <text start="493.2" dur="5.1">of rejection yeah probably I did just</text>
  <text start="495.81" dur="5.13">just because not because of my art but</text>
  <text start="498.3" dur="5.97">more because of my personality and my</text>
  <text start="500.94" dur="5.13">inability to talk to people so I was</text>
  <text start="504.27" dur="3.72">afraid what if they ask me this what</text>
  <text start="506.07" dur="4.32">will I say when you&amp;#39;re young you&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="507.99" dur="3.66">that good at conversing with older</text>
  <text start="510.39" dur="2.88">people you know I thought all these</text>
  <text start="511.65" dur="3.75">gallery owners they&amp;#39;re all older than me</text>
  <text start="513.27" dur="3.81">what do I know and I really didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="515.4" dur="3.3">that much they don&amp;#39;t teach you in art</text>
  <text start="517.08" dur="4.56">school that much about the actual art</text>
  <text start="518.7" dur="4.56">business right and how to get into a</text>
  <text start="521.64" dur="3.93">gallery oh they have like a little class</text>
  <text start="523.26" dur="4.38">on it maybe but it&amp;#39;s all about know how</text>
  <text start="525.57" dur="4.53">to shake hands with confidence and you</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="5.28">don&amp;#39;t know what to say yeah it&amp;#39;s too bad</text>
  <text start="530.1" dur="4.38">and negotiate a price for your work it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="532.92" dur="2.79">too bad in high school composition they</text>
  <text start="534.48" dur="4.29">don&amp;#39;t teach you how to publish Kindle</text>
  <text start="535.71" dur="5.46">books well maybe yeah they should I mean</text>
  <text start="538.77" dur="5.37">there&amp;#39;s so much practical stuff that</text>
  <text start="541.17" dur="4.65">needs to be taught and you don&amp;#39;t get it</text>
  <text start="544.14" dur="4.17">in school a lot of times I think in</text>
  <text start="545.82" dur="3.45">almost every profession you learn a lot</text>
  <text start="548.31" dur="3.72">by doing</text>
  <text start="549.27" dur="4.71">on the job the stuff you didn&amp;#39;t learn in</text>
  <text start="552.03" dur="4.98">school there&amp;#39;s a lot of theoretical</text>
  <text start="553.98" dur="5.37">stuff that you learn yeah it&amp;#39;s so much</text>
  <text start="557.01" dur="5.07">easier now because not if you&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="559.35" dur="4.44">introvert you can still do Facebook you</text>

  <text start="567.18" dur="6.42">am in talking to a group for example</text>
  <text start="571.41" dur="4.74">that is terrifying for a lot of people</text>
  <text start="573.6" dur="4.98">not just me but it&amp;#39;s easier when you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="576.15" dur="3.93">behind a podcast microphone yeah and</text>
  <text start="578.58" dur="3.78">with Facebook you can take as much time</text>

  <text start="582.36" dur="5.13">and you can edit really good and you</text>

  <text start="1318.53" dur="5.19">found is people spend way too much time</text>
  <text start="1321.73" dur="3.46">guarding the one or two books that</text>
  <text start="1323.72" dur="3.33">they&amp;#39;ve written and trying to promote</text>

  <text start="1332.99" dur="5.73">that the secret to being successful as</text>

  <text start="1338.72" dur="4.199">write a book promote it for a week or</text>
  <text start="1342.08" dur="2.069">two but</text>
  <text start="1342.919" dur="3.48">at that time you should be working on</text>
  <text start="1344.149" dur="4.14">your next book mm-hmm write another book</text>
  <text start="1346.399" dur="4.831">and get it out there and make it on a</text>
  <text start="1348.289" dur="4.62">different subject and promote that for a</text>
  <text start="1351.23" dur="3.75">while and then write another book and</text>
  <text start="1352.909" dur="4.051">write another book and keep writing more</text>
  <text start="1354.98" dur="4.949">books because each time you publish a</text>
  <text start="1356.96" dur="5.49">book and you post an excerpt of it on</text>
  <text start="1359.929" dur="4.74">your blog or you talk about it on your</text>
  <text start="1362.45" dur="4.289">podcast or whatever it is that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1364.669" dur="4.26">doing - you know social media wise each</text>
  <text start="1366.739" dur="4.05">time you create a little more content</text>
  <text start="1368.929" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;re expanding your audience a little</text>
  <text start="1370.789" dur="5.401">bit more now my next book that I&amp;#39;m gonna</text>

  <text start="1410.299" dur="3.541">they said just turn into an e-book so I</text>
  <text start="1412.519" dur="3.24">wrote a little bit more over a couple of</text>

  <text start="1415.759" dur="3.24">I&amp;#39;m gonna be publishing an e-book on</text>

  <text start="1527.72" dur="5.48">downright bad they&amp;#39;re atrocious so find</text>
  <text start="1530.84" dur="5.25">someone who knows what they&amp;#39;re doing</text>
  <text start="1533.2" dur="5.38">even if it&amp;#39;s just for spelling</text>

  <text start="1552.14" dur="6.24">really important if you&amp;#39;ve been writing</text>
  <text start="1554.68" dur="6.13">as a blogger or as a writer for more</text>
  <text start="1558.38" dur="6.87">than three or four years you should have</text>
  <text start="1560.81" dur="7.95">some pretty good idea about how to write</text>
  <text start="1565.25" dur="5.13">a good message that is punctuated</text>
  <text start="1568.76" dur="3.75">correctly that has decent sentence</text>
  <text start="1570.38" dur="4.14">structure a good flow of thought and</text>
  <text start="1572.51" dur="3.78">doesn&amp;#39;t need a lot of editing if you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1588.05" dur="3.06">that nature those people are gonna need</text>
  <text start="1589.43" dur="5.07">a lot more help with editing and yeah I</text>
  <text start="1591.11" dur="5.31">would definitely suggest have someone</text>
  <text start="1594.5" dur="4.62">edit your work before you publish it</text>
  <text start="1596.42" dur="4.95">because there there are a lot of people</text>

  <text start="1611.81" dur="3.42">it&amp;#39;s basically a waste of time you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="1901.82" dur="4.71">they finally did settle out of court</text>
  <text start="1904.16" dur="5.19">I guess because they knew they weren&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1935.75" dur="5.64">name it was huge so you don&amp;#39;t want to</text>

  <text start="1941.39" dur="3.93">name that nobody else has do some</text>
  <text start="1943.82" dur="6.08">research and make sure you have a name</text>

  <text start="1978.34" dur="4.21">different name even though we&amp;#39;re using</text>
  <text start="1980.42" dur="4.56">the same thank you so the business end</text>

  <text start="2088.179" dur="4.95">Pennsylvania and it was so difficult</text>
  <text start="2090.21" dur="5.29">very time-consuming but now when we have</text>
  <text start="2093.129" dur="4.201">just our business account we pay for</text>

  <text start="2158.32" dur="5.34">have some kind of health insurance what</text>
  <text start="2160.33" dur="6.9">we found out was through our business</text>
  <text start="2163.66" dur="7.02">our LLC we needed to start giving</text>
  <text start="2167.23" dur="5.46">ourselves a paycheck and we got set up</text>
  <text start="2170.68" dur="4.91">with this company called paychecks they</text>
  <text start="2172.69" dur="7.35">do payroll services for small businesses</text>

  <text start="2180.04" dur="4.41">setting you up yeah since I know more</text>
  <text start="2182.02" dur="5.94">about that I believe it was when we just</text>
  <text start="2184.45" dur="5.49">had this simple LLC we didn&amp;#39;t do a</text>
  <text start="2187.96" dur="3.51">paycheck we would just take money out of</text>
  <text start="2189.94" dur="3.39">our business account move it into our</text>
  <text start="2191.47" dur="5.639">personal account when we needed money</text>
  <text start="2193.33" dur="6.45">you know to live on and that&amp;#39;s perfectly</text>
  <text start="2197.109" dur="4.26">okay when you&amp;#39;re you can do that when</text>

  <text start="2201.369" dur="4.801">as an LLC but then our when we started</text>
  <text start="2204.609" dur="4.471">actually earning money which was</text>
  <text start="2206.17" dur="4.14">surprising our tax guy said oh you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="2220.03" dur="5.66">we were earning enough money that he</text>
  <text start="2222.07" dur="7.26">said you better switch over and get S</text>
  <text start="2225.69" dur="7.63">corporation tax designation for next</text>

  <text start="2301.31" dur="3.57">out it&amp;#39;s not a lot it looks like it</text>
  <text start="2303.23" dur="4.109">could be a little intimidating but it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2304.88" dur="4.05">really at the end of the day it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="2307.339" dur="3.151">lot of paperwork you can get help with</text>
  <text start="2308.93" dur="3.87">that you can get help with it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2310.49" dur="4.02">the the state office was pretty good at</text>
  <text start="2312.8" dur="4.14">helping us fill it out and we just</text>
  <text start="2314.51" dur="3.99">filled it out and you know I&amp;#39;m a CEO or</text>
  <text start="2316.94" dur="3.75">I&amp;#39;m the president and she&amp;#39;s the vice</text>
  <text start="2318.5" dur="5.01">president or whatever we officially you</text>
  <text start="2320.69" dur="4.679">have to have periodic meetings where you</text>
  <text start="2323.51" dur="3.51">vote on stuff and you keep the minutes</text>
  <text start="2325.369" dur="3.931">and keep the minutes of the meeting and</text>
  <text start="2327.02" dur="4.05">take the notes just get a folder and put</text>
  <text start="2329.3" dur="3.539">all your stuff in that folder thank you</text>
  <text start="2331.07" dur="3.66">in our situation we really don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="2332.839" dur="3.691">do that like once a year it&amp;#39;s yeah</text>
  <text start="2334.73" dur="3.96">because we&amp;#39;re just the mom-and-pop thing</text>
  <text start="2336.53" dur="4.65">we don&amp;#39;t have employees right it&amp;#39;s not a</text>
  <text start="2338.69" dur="5.22">huge deal we don&amp;#39;t have any shareholders</text>
  <text start="2341.18" dur="5.37">or anybody else involved in our finances</text>
  <text start="2343.91" dur="5.85">so what you were saying though about the</text>
  <text start="2346.55" dur="5.19">S corp is yeah so once you are in S corp</text>
  <text start="2349.76" dur="4.95">then you have to pay yourself a paycheck</text>
  <text start="2351.74" dur="5.91">and then you are both employer and</text>
  <text start="2354.71" dur="6.21">employee so you pay some taxes as an</text>
  <text start="2357.65" dur="7.05">employer and you also pay taxes as an</text>
  <text start="2360.92" dur="6.48">employee but then what they do is the</text>
  <text start="2364.7" dur="5.669">paycheck that you pay yourself gets</text>
  <text start="2367.4" dur="4.92">taxed at a higher rate and then other</text>
  <text start="2370.369" dur="4.021">money that you move out of the business</text>
  <text start="2372.32" dur="4.83">into your personal account I believe</text>
  <text start="2374.39" dur="5.64">it&amp;#39;s called distributions you can take</text>
  <text start="2377.15" dur="4.86">distributions as well and those are</text>
  <text start="2380.03" dur="4.89">taxed at a lower rate so that was the</text>
  <text start="2382.01" dur="4.589">benefit of doing this plus there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="2384.92" dur="6.21">of other benefits once you go into that</text>
  <text start="2386.599" dur="6.091">realm of operation okay you can we had</text>
  <text start="2391.13" dur="4.38">all that done through paychecks and</text>
  <text start="2392.69" dur="5.61">paychecks allows anyone who subscribed</text>
  <text start="2395.51" dur="5.22">to their service to join in their health</text>
  <text start="2398.3" dur="4.17">network so you can get health insurance</text>
  <text start="2400.73" dur="4.08">to them right so we didn&amp;#39;t do that yet</text>
  <text start="2402.47" dur="5.7">but if praying medic leaves his</text>
  <text start="2404.81" dur="5.82">paramedic job then we have the ability</text>
  <text start="2408.17" dur="4.439">to get our health insurance through</text>
  <text start="2410.63" dur="4.56">paychecks the place we&amp;#39;re doing our</text>
  <text start="2412.609" dur="4.94">payroll there&amp;#39;s also a bunch of tax</text>
  <text start="2415.19" dur="4.5">advantages you can set up 401ks and</text>
  <text start="2417.549" dur="4.631">retirement accounts yeah through that</text>
  <text start="2419.69" dur="3.99">which will further reduce your tax</text>
  <text start="2422.18" dur="4.29">burden there&amp;#39;s some really cool stuff</text>
  <text start="2423.68" dur="5.79">involved once you become an S corp it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2426.47" dur="4.98">a little more complicated but there are</text>
  <text start="2429.47" dur="4.17">some scary in the beginning yeah there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2431.45" dur="3.69">a little scary but if a couple of idiots</text>
  <text start="2433.64" dur="4.14">like us availa do it you guys can do it</text>
  <text start="2435.14" dur="4.5">too so yeah thankfully there are people</text>
  <text start="2437.78" dur="3.39">who help you I mean paychecks are the</text>
  <text start="2439.64" dur="3.84">people thing paychecks were house and</text>
  <text start="2441.17" dur="4.73">they were very very helpful explained it</text>
  <text start="2443.48" dur="5.819">I was meeting with us and they were</text>
  <text start="2445.9" dur="5.14">informing us of all the services they</text>
  <text start="2449.299" dur="3.391">provide and they can help us with and</text>
  <text start="2451.04" dur="4.2">all the things that are available to an</text>
  <text start="2452.69" dur="4.649">S corporation so and then anytime I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2455.24" dur="5.01">had any kind of letter come in from the</text>
  <text start="2457.339" dur="7.26">state of Arizona about our business I</text>
  <text start="2460.25" dur="6.299">just I just pick a copy and send it</text>
  <text start="2464.599" dur="4.591">digitally to the people at paychecks and</text>
  <text start="2466.549" dur="4.171">they say we&amp;#39;re taking care of it I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2469.19" dur="2.48">thinking great because I don&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="2470.72" dur="3.389">what this means</text>
  <text start="2471.67" dur="4.12">yeah the other thing that I wanted to</text>
  <text start="2474.109" dur="5.641">talk briefly about is the separation</text>
  <text start="2475.79" dur="9.72">between ministry which is some people</text>
  <text start="2479.75" dur="7.68">run as a tax-exempt entity and then your</text>
  <text start="2485.51" dur="6.539">business and I&amp;#39;m not gonna say a lot</text>
  <text start="2487.43" dur="6.96">about it other than to say that if you</text>
  <text start="2492.049" dur="6.151">are producing things like books or</text>
  <text start="2494.39" dur="6.719">paintings or music a lot of that</text>
  <text start="2498.2" dur="5.07">production and sales of that stuff you</text>
  <text start="2501.109" dur="3.841">cannot do through a tax-exempt</text>
  <text start="2503.27" dur="4.17">organization you have to do it through a</text>
  <text start="2504.95" dur="4.77">business the IRS gets a little bit weird</text>
  <text start="2507.44" dur="5.07">about that kind of stuff yes so find out</text>
  <text start="2509.72" dur="3.599">in your area yeah so Gerry Jeremy is a</text>
  <text start="2512.51" dur="3.39">good example</text>
  <text start="2513.319" dur="5.341">Jeremy mag machine Jeremy has two</text>
  <text start="2515.9" dur="6.87">different entities he&amp;#39;s got Bastien</text>
  <text start="2518.66" dur="5.429">ministries which is 593 tax-exempt his</text>
  <text start="2522.77" dur="4.71">ministry stuff goes through that and</text>
  <text start="2524.089" dur="5.76">then his books are sold through his</text>
  <text start="2527.48" dur="4.109">personal business right and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2529.849" dur="3.811">probably not a bad idea to have a</text>
  <text start="2531.589" dur="3.361">separation if you have a ministry and</text>
  <text start="2533.66" dur="3.03">you&amp;#39;re going to be producing things</text>
  <text start="2534.95" dur="3.54">you&amp;#39;re gonna be selling you don&amp;#39;t want</text>
  <text start="2536.69" dur="5.16">to be mixing those two you probably want</text>
  <text start="2538.49" dur="6.81">to have a business for the sales</text>
  <text start="2541.85" dur="5.34">and your 501c3 or your tax exempt or</text>
  <text start="2545.3" dur="4.17">donations and every for donations yeah</text>
  <text start="2547.19" dur="5.46">just something to think about there is a</text>
  <text start="2549.47" dur="4.95">lot to think about in this but it&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="2552.65" dur="2.97">step at a time I mean yeah you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2554.42" dur="3.27">have to know it all at once it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2555.62" dur="4.92">learning process you just you know do</text>
  <text start="2557.69" dur="5.52">some research look on the internet make</text>
  <text start="2560.54" dur="6.06">some phone calls to your state business</text>
  <text start="2563.21" dur="6.06">people it&amp;#39;s not as difficult as it</text>
  <text start="2566.6" dur="4.77">probably looks from the outside we&amp;#39;re on</text>
  <text start="2569.27" dur="3.45">the inside looking out and it&amp;#39;s not that</text>
  <text start="2571.37" dur="3.27">bad we&amp;#39;re actually having a lot of fun</text>
  <text start="2572.72" dur="4.02">doing it I mean there&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text>
  <text start="2574.64" dur="4.53">work to it there&amp;#39;s actually probably a</text>
  <text start="2576.74" dur="4.77">lot of work to it but it&amp;#39;s our thing so</text>
  <text start="2579.17" dur="6.6">we&amp;#39;re enjoying the stuff we do and we</text>
  <text start="2581.51" dur="6.3">get worn out and our idea of rest is you</text>
  <text start="2585.77" dur="5.46">know we go out to dinner and talk more</text>
  <text start="2587.81" dur="4.92">about business yeah I mean or we get in</text>
  <text start="2591.23" dur="7.44">the bed and turn on the computer and</text>
  <text start="2592.73" dur="8.34">watch old episodes of Overhaulin so we</text>
  <text start="2598.67" dur="4.62">get a break once in a while but yeah but</text>
