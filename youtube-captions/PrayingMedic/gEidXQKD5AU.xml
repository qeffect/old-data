  <text start="687.28" dur="7.56">behest of the CIA Libya and Egypt and</text>
  <text start="693.4" dur="5.61">the other countries where there was a</text>
  <text start="694.84" dur="7.52">regime change there was CIA backing and</text>
  <text start="699.01" dur="7.68">all of that in in it was it was ugly and</text>
  <text start="702.36" dur="7.87">there were a lot of deaths and it was it</text>
  <text start="706.69" dur="8.28">was difficult to watch that happen this</text>
  <text start="710.23" dur="8.4">time there has sort of been regime</text>
  <text start="714.97" dur="11.69">change in Saudi Arabia there is an</text>
  <text start="718.63" dur="8.03">undergoing regime change in Syria in</text>
  <text start="726.78" dur="7.39">probably in some other places I would</text>
  <text start="732.1" dur="6.24">not be surprised if we see regime change</text>
  <text start="734.17" dur="7.44">in Turkey but not as a result of us</text>
  <text start="738.34" dur="6.39">boots on the ground and US policy that</text>
  <text start="741.61" dur="6.21">forces these people up the regime change</text>
  <text start="744.73" dur="6.39">is coming organically it&amp;#39;s coming from</text>
  <text start="747.82" dur="6.12">inside the country and we&amp;#39;re not having</text>
  <text start="751.12" dur="5.85">to do anything to make it happen</text>
  <text start="753.94" dur="6.27">and this is this is where I saw it start</text>
  <text start="756.97" dur="6.39">it&amp;#39;s in Saudi Arabia when President</text>
  <text start="760.21" dur="6.48">Trump went to Saudi Arabia and he talked</text>
  <text start="763.36" dur="7.26">to all the Arab nations okay what did he</text>
  <text start="766.69" dur="7.32">tell them he told them you are</text>
  <text start="770.62" dur="6.84">supporting terrorists and the terrorists</text>
  <text start="774.01" dur="4.98">are stealing your resources taking your</text>
  <text start="777.46" dur="3.36">money they&amp;#39;re destroying your country</text>
  <text start="778.99" dur="5.09">and they&amp;#39;re killing your children you</text>
  <text start="780.82" dur="6.33">have got to stop supporting terrorists</text>
  <text start="784.08" dur="5.95">that was his message to the Arab world</text>
  <text start="787.15" dur="7.29">you have to stop supporting terrorists</text>
  <text start="790.03" dur="6.18">it can no longer be acceptable and he</text>
  <text start="794.44" dur="5.04">said look we are not interested in</text>
  <text start="796.21" dur="4.54">nation-building unlike former presidents</text>
  <text start="799.48" dur="3.63">who were all about nation</text>
  <text start="800.75" dur="7.74">because that has been the deep states</text>
  <text start="803.11" dur="8.409">default foreign policy for the last 30</text>
  <text start="808.49" dur="4.529">years 40 years Trump said we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="811.519" dur="3.661">interested in nation-building we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="813.019" dur="5.971">going to do regime change we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="815.18" dur="5.969">going to tell you how to operate your</text>
  <text start="818.99" dur="4.92">country we&amp;#39;re going to tell you what</text>
  <text start="821.149" dur="4.891">we&amp;#39;re doing and Trump said we are gonna</text>
  <text start="823.91" dur="4.88">bomb the hell out of Isis we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="826.04" dur="5.609">after Hezbollah we&amp;#39;re going after every</text>
  <text start="828.79" dur="5.289">terrorist organization and we won&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="831.649" dur="5.101">to it that they are made extinct you can</text>
  <text start="834.079" dur="4.37">either help us or you can stand in our</text>
  <text start="836.75" dur="4.98">way</text>
  <text start="838.449" dur="7.271">so Trump laid down the law and he told</text>
  <text start="841.73" dur="6.12">the Saudis and everyone else we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="845.72" dur="5.07">into regime change but we are going to</text>
  <text start="847.85" dur="6.029">take out terrorists and you can either</text>
  <text start="850.79" dur="5.88">help us or get on board or stand in our</text>
  <text start="853.879" dur="6.33">way and the Saudis got hip to it pretty</text>
  <text start="856.67" dur="6">quickly and what the Saudis did then was</text>
  <text start="860.209" dur="5.13">they rounded up all these corrupt Saudi</text>
  <text start="862.67" dur="9.539">princes who were the ones backing the</text>
  <text start="865.339" dur="9.18">terrorists okay how is Iran receiving a</text>
  <text start="872.209" dur="3.81">lot of its funding its funding comes</text>
  <text start="874.519" dur="5.55">from terrorist organizations the</text>
  <text start="876.019" dur="6.781">terrorists sort of they bring in money</text>
  <text start="880.069" dur="5.88">and they spend money and in in these</text>
  <text start="882.8" dur="6.029">states a lot of the the economics is all</text>
  <text start="885.949" dur="7.44">driven around arms sales weapons sales</text>
  <text start="888.829" dur="8.401">so if you defund the terrorists it</text>
  <text start="893.389" dur="9.211">immediately pulls up your freezing</text>
  <text start="897.23" dur="9.02">assets now look look in on December 21st</text>
  <text start="902.6" dur="7.589">Trump signed an executive order Global</text>
  <text start="906.25" dur="8.519">Magnitsky Act what does it do it freezes</text>
  <text start="910.189" dur="8.791">the assets of organizations and people</text>
  <text start="914.769" dur="9.841">known to be violating human rights human</text>
  <text start="918.98" dur="8.52">trafficking and corruption if any</text>
  <text start="924.61" dur="7.3">terrorist organizations or people in</text>
  <text start="927.5" dur="6.329">government in the Middle East had any</text>
  <text start="931.91" dur="2.58">assets that the US could department</text>
  <text start="933.829" dur="4.411">could get access</text>
  <text start="934.49" dur="7.789">- it&amp;#39;s all frozen it&amp;#39;s all gone and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="938.24" dur="6.719">wondering if some of this had to do with</text>
  <text start="942.279" dur="6.611">removing the financial support of the</text>
  <text start="944.959" dur="8.731">Iranian regime in order to weaken them</text>
  <text start="948.89" dur="8.49">which would then allow the citizens to</text>
  <text start="953.69" dur="7.47">take advantage of that and overpower</text>
  <text start="957.38" dur="7.32">them and force them out I wonder it we</text>
  <text start="961.16" dur="8.46">don&amp;#39;t know we don&amp;#39;t know but it makes me</text>
  <text start="964.7" dur="8.37">the timing of the of the protests is</text>
  <text start="969.62" dur="5.37">just so interesting I think it has</text>
  <text start="973.07" dur="3.72">something to do with the strategy that</text>
  <text start="974.99" dur="3.81">Trump has been working Trump is so</text>
  <text start="976.79" dur="5.22">strategic it&amp;#39;s really difficult to know</text>
  <text start="978.8" dur="6.18">how much of his movements and policies</text>
  <text start="982.01" dur="6">around the world have this domino effect</text>
  <text start="984.98" dur="6.09">but I think that what we&amp;#39;re seeing is</text>
  <text start="988.01" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re seeing a weakening of all the</text>
  <text start="991.07" dur="5.67">terrorist organizations in the Middle</text>
  <text start="992.45" dur="6.36">East we&amp;#39;re seeing a weakening in support</text>
  <text start="996.74" dur="6.24">for the leaders that are supporting</text>
  <text start="998.81" dur="7.11">terrorists and Trump&amp;#39;s policy his strong</text>
  <text start="1002.98" dur="5.16">stance against terrorism is really taken</text>
  <text start="1005.92" dur="5.43">hold I think in the Middle East and I</text>
  <text start="1008.14" dur="4.38">think it is going to I think it&amp;#39;s going</text>
  <text start="1011.35" dur="2.82">to have a ripple effect I think it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1012.52" dur="3.45">gonna have a domino effect and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1014.17" dur="7.2">gonna see Afghanistan we may see</text>
  <text start="1015.97" dur="7.8">Pakistan and other countries come out</text>
  <text start="1021.37" dur="6.18">from under that oppressive regime that</text>
  <text start="1023.77" dur="7.4">supports terrorists i I think that&amp;#39;s one</text>
  <text start="1027.55" dur="3.62">of the things we&amp;#39;re going to see in 2018</text>
  <text start="1031.47" dur="11.41">so let me move on to last night&amp;#39;s dream</text>
  <text start="1037.15" dur="8.189">dreams two of them I would not be</text>
  <text start="1042.88" dur="5.88">surprised if Trump goes down as one of</text>
  <text start="1045.339" dur="5.701">the best presidents ever and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="1048.76" dur="5.94">shame that half of America doesn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="1051.04" dur="5.37">it they have been so blinded by the lies</text>
  <text start="1054.7" dur="3.81">and the deception from the mainstream</text>
  <text start="1056.41" dur="4.5">media they just can&amp;#39;t look at it</text>
  <text start="1058.51" dur="5.15">objectively and see what&amp;#39;s happening but</text>
  <text start="1060.91" dur="6.6">Trump is changing the world through</text>
  <text start="1063.66" dur="4.72">strong leadership and you know if you</text>
  <text start="1067.51" dur="2.97">listen to CNN</text>
  <text start="1068.38" dur="5.76">he&amp;#39;s just the biggest fool in the world</text>
  <text start="1070.48" dur="6.45">I don&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;m kind of speechless it</text>
  <text start="1074.14" dur="4.98">as to how people can be so fooled into</text>
  <text start="1076.93" dur="9.8">thinking that he&amp;#39;s just a horrible</text>
  <text start="1079.12" dur="9.33">president it just boggles my mind so</text>
  <text start="1086.73" dur="4.39">last night&amp;#39;s Dreams</text>

  <text start="1110.2" dur="8.07">some stuff so and look I I need to do a</text>
  <text start="1115.48" dur="5.22">little bit of you know full confession</text>
  <text start="1118.27" dur="5.34">here this is not what I expected to be</text>
  <text start="1120.7" dur="6.78">doing at this point in my life after I</text>
  <text start="1123.61" dur="7.16">came back from Washington in August</text>
  <text start="1127.48" dur="7.5">after my last public conference I</text>
  <text start="1130.77" dur="5.95">expected to be going ahead on some book</text>
  <text start="1134.98" dur="4.92">projects I did finish up one book and</text>
  <text start="1136.72" dur="6.21">it&amp;#39;s being edited but I expected to be</text>
  <text start="1139.9" dur="4.53">more involved in engaging the heavenly</text>
  <text start="1142.93" dur="5.04">realms and teaching on the supernatural</text>
  <text start="1144.43" dur="6.3">and doing another class an online class</text>
  <text start="1147.97" dur="4.65">doing some videos teaching and writing</text>
  <text start="1150.73" dur="4.38">books because that&amp;#39;s what I do for a</text>
  <text start="1152.62" dur="6.45">living that is what I expected to be</text>
  <text start="1155.11" dur="6.51">doing right about now I had no idea I</text>
  <text start="1159.07" dur="4.22">would be this involved in politics and</text>
  <text start="1161.62" dur="4.95">current events and I never thought I</text>
  <text start="1163.29" dur="4.69">would be doing a daily broadcast on news</text>
  <text start="1166.57" dur="5.28">and current events I just didn&amp;#39;t see</text>
  <text start="1167.98" dur="6.21">that coming I&amp;#39;m still scratching my head</text>
  <text start="1171.85" dur="3.75">a little bit as to where this is going</text>
  <text start="1174.19" dur="4.02">and what its gonna look like how long</text>
  <text start="1175.6" dur="4.17">it&amp;#39;s going to last I don&amp;#39;t know some</text>
  <text start="1178.21" dur="5.21">people have been bugging me wanting to</text>

  <text start="1183.42" dur="5.47">it we have had a little bit of a hit</text>
  <text start="1186.4" dur="6">financially because I&amp;#39;m a full time</text>
  <text start="1188.89" dur="5.33">author and one of the things about being</text>
  <text start="1192.4" dur="5.04">an author if you make your living off of</text>
  <text start="1194.22" dur="7.12">the books that you write is you have to</text>
  <text start="1197.44" dur="4.69">continue publishing books and selling</text>
  <text start="1201.34" dur="4.39">books and promote</text>
  <text start="1202.13" dur="6.93">books if you don&amp;#39;t your income just goes</text>
  <text start="1205.73" dur="5.4">down you have to continue publishing and</text>
  <text start="1209.06" dur="3.8">promoting books and I haven&amp;#39;t really</text>
  <text start="1211.13" dur="4.2">been doing that over the last few months</text>
  <text start="1212.86" dur="6.45">I&amp;#39;ve really been involved in current</text>
  <text start="1215.33" dur="9.3">events and doing these videos and</text>

  <text start="1230.84" dur="5.76">is it is making up the shortfall that</text>
  <text start="1235.1" dur="4.59">happened because I&amp;#39;m not promoting and</text>
  <text start="1236.6" dur="4.5">selling my books as much so because</text>

  <text start="1790.459" dur="7.98">been collecting everyone&amp;#39;s information</text>
  <text start="1792.919" dur="9.66">for a long long time and here is the</text>
  <text start="1798.439" dur="6.78">thing well let me let me go to the</text>
  <text start="1802.579" dur="5.82">second dream before I unpack what this</text>
  <text start="1805.219" dur="7.41">is all about the NSA right so in the</text>
  <text start="1808.399" dur="6.93">second dream second dream was like the</text>
  <text start="1812.629" dur="6.09">first one but it only involved the</text>
  <text start="1815.329" dur="6.99">Clintons and the crimes that they were</text>
  <text start="1818.719" dur="8.25">guilty of and their associates I kind of</text>
  <text start="1822.319" dur="6.24">just narrowed down and again I I had and</text>
  <text start="1826.969" dur="4.14">this is just this is the hardest dream</text>
  <text start="1828.559" dur="5.7">in the world to describe it was like I</text>
  <text start="1831.109" dur="11.25">had somehow again stumbled upon</text>
  <text start="1834.259" dur="10.92">accidentally a service or a network that</text>
  <text start="1842.359" dur="5.46">had the information on the Clintons all</text>
  <text start="1845.179" dur="4.92">of the crimes all the associates dates</text>
  <text start="1847.819" dur="6.36">times places names everything that all</text>
  <text start="1850.099" dur="7.08">the information was there and I was able</text>
  <text start="1854.179" dur="4.8">to interact with this service but I was</text>
  <text start="1857.179" dur="3.9">only able to do it almost like I had to</text>
  <text start="1858.979" dur="4.68">do it subconsciously like you could not</text>
  <text start="1861.079" dur="5.22">consciously contact them and you</text>
  <text start="1863.659" dur="4.89">couldn&amp;#39;t see them in the natural like</text>
  <text start="1866.299" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;s not like they had a building on a</text>
  <text start="1868.549" dur="2.131">street where you could just walk in and</text>
  <text start="1869.869" dur="5.221">talk to them about</text>
  <text start="1870.68" dur="7.41">I was accessing this information through</text>
  <text start="1875.09" dur="5.64">dreams they were contacting me and I was</text>
  <text start="1878.09" dur="4.74">contacting them through dreams and they</text>
  <text start="1880.73" dur="4.98">were asking me questions what did I know</text>
  <text start="1882.83" dur="4.86">about the clintons and their crimes and</text>
  <text start="1885.71" dur="3.65">how could ask them questions what do you</text>
  <text start="1887.69" dur="6.09">know about the clintons in their crimes</text>
  <text start="1889.36" dur="6.7">so it was a service or a database that</text>
  <text start="1893.78" dur="5.91">had information on the Clinton crimes</text>
  <text start="1896.06" dur="7.68">and they would query you to find out</text>
  <text start="1899.69" dur="7.02">what you knew and you could ask them to</text>
  <text start="1903.74" dur="6.72">verify what you already had but it was</text>
  <text start="1906.71" dur="6.54">super top secret and like nobody knew</text>
  <text start="1910.46" dur="5.58">about it it was like almost impossible</text>
  <text start="1913.25" dur="4.47">to find out where this place was how do</text>
  <text start="1916.04" dur="4.19">you connect how do you interface with</text>
  <text start="1917.72" dur="5.55">this thing it was it was just weird and</text>
  <text start="1920.23" dur="7.48">so that&amp;#39;s the dream that&amp;#39;s the second</text>
  <text start="1923.27" dur="7.35">dream now as I take those two dreams and</text>
  <text start="1927.71" dur="6.51">I put them together what I&amp;#39;m wondering</text>
  <text start="1930.62" dur="6.06">is okay I have it&amp;#39;s essentially</text>
  <text start="1934.22" dur="5.1">represents a database of information on</text>
  <text start="1936.68" dur="6.24">the Clintons and the global crime</text>
  <text start="1939.32" dur="7.05">syndicate and somebody has all this</text>
  <text start="1942.92" dur="6.69">information stored somewhere and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1946.37" dur="7.11">hard to access it&amp;#39;s not like it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1949.61" dur="6.54">exist it does exist but only a few</text>
  <text start="1953.48" dur="6.09">people have access limited access to</text>
  <text start="1956.15" dur="5.79">this information okay so that&amp;#39;s why I</text>
  <text start="1959.57" dur="4.86">think the dreams are actually talking</text>
  <text start="1961.94" dur="6.23">probably about the NSA National Security</text>
  <text start="1964.43" dur="3.74">Agency no such agency</text>
  <text start="1968.27" dur="8.16">I think the dreams are telling me that</text>
  <text start="1973.61" dur="5.61">the NSA has all this information they&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="1976.43" dur="4.29">got it all none of this has been done in</text>
  <text start="1979.22" dur="4.35">the corner where no one can see it</text>
  <text start="1980.72" dur="5.3">they&amp;#39;ve got the tapes they&amp;#39;ve got look</text>
  <text start="1983.57" dur="4.77">if you want to know where Hillary&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1986.02" dur="4.15">33000 deleted emails are I can tell you</text>
  <text start="1988.34" dur="4.23">where they&amp;#39;re there any NSA database I</text>
  <text start="1990.17" dur="4.79">guarantee you Admiral Admiral Rogers has</text>
  <text start="1992.57" dur="5.43">every one of those emails in fact</text>
  <text start="1994.96" dur="5.44">kim.com went on Twitter a couple months</text>
  <text start="1998" dur="5.94">ago and told and tweeted at NSA and said</text>
  <text start="2000.4" dur="4.2">hey you know you&amp;#39;ve got the Hillary</text>
  <text start="2003.94" dur="2.94">delete</text>
  <text start="2004.6" dur="4.02">emails here is the sector that you want</text>
  <text start="2006.88" dur="5.55">to look for here&amp;#39;s a passcode I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2008.62" dur="8.64">there I&amp;#39;ve seen him go look go find them</text>
  <text start="2012.43" dur="6.6">so there isn&amp;#39;t anything that has been</text>
  <text start="2017.26" dur="3.27">done on the internet in the last</text>
  <text start="2019.03" dur="3.75">probably 10 years that the NSA doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2020.53" dur="5.34">know about it&amp;#39;s all the data has been</text>
  <text start="2022.78" dur="5.13">stored for a long time and here is the</text>
  <text start="2025.87" dur="10.67">critical thing that we all have to focus</text>
  <text start="2027.91" dur="15.18">on it was the deep state that created</text>
  <text start="2036.54" dur="9.49">the NSA database which is why it was</text>
  <text start="2043.09" dur="6.87">imperative that the deep state have a</text>
  <text start="2046.03" dur="7.5">president that gay could control because</text>
  <text start="2049.96" dur="7.02">with that kind of information if you</text>
  <text start="2053.53" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t have control of the president all</text>
  <text start="2056.98" dur="6.9">that information could do a lot of</text>
  <text start="2058.9" dur="8.31">damage to people so the deep state</text>
  <text start="2063.88" dur="6.39">creates this monster that observes and</text>
  <text start="2067.21" dur="4.11">knows everything about people in fact</text>
  <text start="2070.27" dur="6.32">let me tell you about a dream that I had</text>
  <text start="2071.32" dur="8.61">a couple years ago I had a dream where</text>
  <text start="2076.59" dur="6.07">someone had access to the manuscripts</text>
  <text start="2079.93" dur="8.19">for my books before I ever put them up</text>
  <text start="2082.66" dur="7.65">on the Internet in the dream I was</text>
  <text start="2088.12" dur="4.11">writing book manuscripts and somebody</text>
  <text start="2090.31" dur="3.5">had accessed them before I even put them</text>
  <text start="2092.23" dur="5.04">made of them available on the internet</text>
  <text start="2093.81" dur="5.05">who would have access to my book</text>

  <text start="2098.86" dur="8.36">computer well we know from vault 7 the</text>
  <text start="2102.91" dur="6.93">drop that WikiLeaks put out that</text>
  <text start="2107.22" dur="5.02">Microsoft and Apple their operating</text>
  <text start="2109.84" dur="6.06">systems had built-in vulnerabilities</text>
  <text start="2112.24" dur="5.88">that the CIA and the NSA put in there so</text>
  <text start="2115.9" dur="4.38">that they could access our computers</text>
  <text start="2118.12" dur="4.11">through our operating system and they</text>
  <text start="2120.28" dur="2.88">could go look around our computers</text>
  <text start="2122.23" dur="5.19">without us knowing about it</text>
  <text start="2123.16" dur="5.76">that&amp;#39;s exactly how the government gets</text>
  <text start="2127.42" dur="5.52">access to your information even if</text>
  <text start="2128.92" dur="6.15">you&amp;#39;re not online so here&amp;#39;s the here&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2132.94" dur="4.85">the interesting thing that I see about</text>
  <text start="2135.07" dur="2.72">all of this is</text>
  <text start="2140.539" dur="7.891">so so the deep state creates this really</text>
  <text start="2144.569" dur="7.29">powerful database that has everybody&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2148.43" dur="7.3">information and they have to hope and</text>
  <text start="2151.859" dur="6.48">pray they never have a president they</text>
  <text start="2155.73" dur="4.71">can&amp;#39;t control because the minute they</text>
  <text start="2158.339" dur="4.861">get a president that can&amp;#39;t be controlled</text>
  <text start="2160.44" dur="4.679">by the deep state that president could</text>
  <text start="2163.2" dur="6.45">take all that information turn it around</text>
  <text start="2165.119" dur="6.45">and use it on them that is why they had</text>
  <text start="2169.65" dur="5.939">to have presidents that they could</text>
  <text start="2171.569" dur="6.181">control so you know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been you</text>
  <text start="2175.589" dur="6.061">know said a lot but a lot of people that</text>
  <text start="2177.75" dur="6">the CIA has really kind of brought in</text>
  <text start="2181.65" dur="5.909">and controlled all the presidents</text>
  <text start="2183.75" dur="6.829">probably since since Kennedy and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2187.559" dur="5.28">because you had to have somebody that</text>
  <text start="2190.579" dur="4.151">with all that intelligence information</text>
  <text start="2192.839" dur="5.671">you had to have somebody who can control</text>
  <text start="2194.73" dur="6.21">the deep state did not anticipate Donald</text>
  <text start="2198.51" dur="5.339">Trump winning the election Trump can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2200.94" dur="6.51">be controlled by the CIA or the NSA or</text>
  <text start="2203.849" dur="5.071">the deep state he is his own guy they</text>
  <text start="2207.45" dur="4.889">don&amp;#39;t have any blackmail on them they</text>
  <text start="2208.92" dur="6.3">don&amp;#39;t have any any dirt on him they</text>
  <text start="2212.339" dur="5.791">looked they have been surveilling Trump</text>
  <text start="2215.22" dur="5.309">for a long time longer than his made</text>
  <text start="2218.13" dur="3.929">public if you do some research you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2220.529" dur="3">find out they have been surveilling and</text>
  <text start="2222.059" dur="3.871">looking into Trump stuff for a lot</text>
  <text start="2223.529" dur="5.161">longer than you would think and they</text>
  <text start="2225.93" dur="5.34">could never get any dirt on him</text>
  <text start="2228.69" dur="4.08">they couldn&amp;#39;t blackmail him the the best</text>
  <text start="2231.27" dur="3.45">that they were to able to come up with</text>
  <text start="2232.77" dur="5.039">was the Billy Bush tapes that&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="2234.72" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s the best they could find all the</text>
  <text start="2237.809" dur="4.591">powerful intelligence of the United</text>
  <text start="2240.45" dur="3.27">States government the best dirt they</text>
  <text start="2242.4" dur="4.709">could come up with on Trump was the Vili</text>
  <text start="2243.72" dur="5.639">wish tape that was pretty weak and that</text>
  <text start="2247.109" dur="3.93">means they had nothing that could</text>
  <text start="2249.359" dur="3.69">blackmail him nothing they could control</text>
  <text start="2251.039" dur="3.75">him with they&amp;#39;ve been able to blackmail</text>
  <text start="2253.049" dur="3.961">and control every other that probably a</text>
  <text start="2254.789" dur="3.57">lot of our elected leaders are being</text>
  <text start="2257.01" dur="2.43">blackmailed controlled by the deep state</text>
  <text start="2258.359" dur="3.661">that&amp;#39;s how politics works</text>
  <text start="2259.44" dur="4.56">you control politicians and the votes</text>
  <text start="2262.02" dur="5.009">and the spending by getting blackmail on</text>
  <text start="2264" dur="5.339">them and we&amp;#39;re gonna find out in 2018</text>
  <text start="2267.029" dur="3.281">exactly how many of our politicians are</text>
  <text start="2269.339" dur="3.831">compromised</text>
  <text start="2270.31" dur="5.38">it is gonna be interesting to see how</text>
  <text start="2273.17" dur="9.84">many step down in the next three or four</text>
  <text start="2275.69" dur="10.62">months so the deep state lost a big</text>
  <text start="2283.01" dur="6.14">gamble when Trump got elected which is</text>
  <text start="2286.31" dur="6.69">why Hillary was reported to have said</text>
  <text start="2289.15" dur="5.95">after the Matt Lauer interview if that</text>
  <text start="2293" dur="6.05">bastard wins we&amp;#39;re all gonna hang from</text>
  <text start="2295.1" dur="7.89">nooses well what did she mean she meant</text>
  <text start="2299.05" dur="7.3">all of that information all of our dirty</text>
  <text start="2302.99" dur="5.67">secrets it&amp;#39;s all in the NSA database and</text>
  <text start="2306.35" dur="4.23">if that Trump bastard gets ahold of that</text>
  <text start="2308.66" dur="5.04">information he&amp;#39;s gonna prosecute every</text>
  <text start="2310.58" dur="5.789">one of us that is why Trump could not</text>
  <text start="2313.7" dur="4.53">win that is why the FBI went out of</text>
  <text start="2316.369" dur="4.681">their way to make sure Trump would not</text>
  <text start="2318.23" dur="5.91">get elected because the entire deep</text>
  <text start="2321.05" dur="6.09">State would be exposed and possibly</text>
  <text start="2324.14" dur="5.76">prosecuted if Trump got elected which is</text>
  <text start="2327.14" dur="6.27">why the FBI&amp;#39;s job was to make sure he</text>
  <text start="2329.9" dur="7.68">didn&amp;#39;t get elected which is why they</text>
  <text start="2333.41" dur="8.61">came up with the steel dossier because</text>
  <text start="2337.58" dur="7.38">in order to use the NSA&amp;#39;s database of</text>
  <text start="2342.02" dur="4.89">information legally you have to have a</text>
  <text start="2344.96" dur="4.649">search warrant you have to have a</text>
  <text start="2346.91" dur="6.449">warrant signed by a judge and they</text>
  <text start="2349.609" dur="8.091">didn&amp;#39;t have probable cause to go get his</text>
  <text start="2353.359" dur="7.141">information so they created evidence and</text>
  <text start="2357.7" dur="5.76">Lindsey Graham as much as came out and</text>
  <text start="2360.5" dur="6.93">said that this week in an interview he</text>
  <text start="2363.46" dur="7.96">said I am very very concerned about what</text>
  <text start="2367.43" dur="6.84">was done with the steel dossier I&amp;#39;m very</text>
  <text start="2371.42" dur="5.07">concerned I he said I&amp;#39;ve learned things</text>
  <text start="2374.27" dur="4.89">in the last few days I&amp;#39;m very concerned</text>
  <text start="2376.49" dur="4.77">we need a special prosecutor just to</text>
  <text start="2379.16" dur="4.14">find out how the steel dossier was</text>
  <text start="2381.26" dur="5.91">handled how did Lindsey Graham know that</text>
  <text start="2383.3" dur="7.08">he&amp;#39;s on the Senate Judiciary Committee</text>
  <text start="2387.17" dur="5.58">he&amp;#39;s a ranking member he knows what</text>
  <text start="2390.38" dur="6.3">happened he knows it he essentially said</text>
  <text start="2392.75" dur="5.7">the FBI used the steel dossier to get</text>
  <text start="2396.68" dur="3.75">the FISA warrant to surveil the Trump</text>
  <text start="2398.45" dur="4.51">team so that they could get access to</text>
  <text start="2400.43" dur="6.49">the NSA&amp;#39;s database okay</text>
  <text start="2402.96" dur="6.29">and here&amp;#39;s the problem anyone involved</text>
  <text start="2406.92" dur="6.439">in that if Lindsey Graham is right</text>
  <text start="2409.25" dur="7.42">they&amp;#39;re all going to be arrested because</text>
  <text start="2413.359" dur="5.171">presenting false information or falsely</text>
  <text start="2416.67" dur="4.889">representing information to a federal</text>
  <text start="2418.53" dur="5.22">court is a felony and they&amp;#39;re guilty of</text>
  <text start="2421.559" dur="4.321">that probably which is why Lindsey</text>
  <text start="2423.75" dur="4.5">Graham wants a special prosecutor and</text>
  <text start="2425.88" dur="5.31">here&amp;#39;s the thing they had to go to</text>
  <text start="2428.25" dur="4.619">extremes to make sure they had some way</text>
  <text start="2431.19" dur="4.77">to get dirt on Trump because they could</text>
  <text start="2432.869" dur="4.831">never let him get inaugurated because if</text>
  <text start="2435.96" dur="4.77">he got inaugurated and he got a hold of</text>
  <text start="2437.7" dur="5.159">the Justice Department and and the NSA</text>
  <text start="2440.73" dur="6.24">database he could prosecute all those</text>
  <text start="2442.859" dur="8.281">people because here&amp;#39;s the thing the NSA</text>
  <text start="2446.97" dur="8.22">database is this vast block of</text>
  <text start="2451.14" dur="7.35">information in and it&amp;#39;s only information</text>
  <text start="2455.19" dur="6.51">that can be used legally if you have</text>
  <text start="2458.49" dur="5.97">probable cause you can&amp;#39;t just take the</text>
  <text start="2461.7" dur="4.95">NSA database information and go digging</text>
  <text start="2464.46" dur="4.44">into somebody&amp;#39;s private life and looking</text>
  <text start="2466.65" dur="4.05">at their emails and then prosecute them</text>
  <text start="2468.9" dur="4.439">for crimes because you found something</text>
  <text start="2470.7" dur="7.369">in the NSA database that&amp;#39;s not how it</text>
  <text start="2473.339" dur="7.76">works the Fourth Amendment guarantees us</text>
  <text start="2478.069" dur="6.161">safety from unlawful search and seizure</text>
  <text start="2481.099" dur="6.911">including electronic surveillance the</text>
  <text start="2484.23" dur="6.18">only way that the NSA information can be</text>
  <text start="2488.01" dur="4.89">used is if you have a warrant you have</text>
  <text start="2490.41" dur="5.28">to go to a court you have to fill out an</text>
  <text start="2492.9" dur="4.83">affidavit with probable cause statements</text>
  <text start="2495.69" dur="4.77">from witnesses whatever go to a court</text>
  <text start="2497.73" dur="5.25">get a judge to sign it you get a warrant</text>
  <text start="2500.46" dur="4.889">then you can go to the NSA database and</text>
  <text start="2502.98" dur="4.17">look for information to support the</text>
  <text start="2505.349" dur="3.21">probable cause of the crime you already</text>
  <text start="2507.15" dur="3.689">believed to have happened that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2508.559" dur="6">only way you can use information that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2510.839" dur="5.46">why the FBI had to go to FISA because</text>
  <text start="2514.559" dur="4.201">they didn&amp;#39;t have probable cause on Trump</text>
  <text start="2516.299" dur="3.991">they went to the FISA Court you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2518.76" dur="4.589">need probable cause you only need to</text>
  <text start="2520.29" dur="9.87">prove that somebody may be a foreign</text>
  <text start="2523.349" dur="11.671">agent so here&amp;#39;s the thing here&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2530.16" dur="5.97">thing just think about this the deep</text>
  <text start="2535.02" dur="4.34">state</text>
  <text start="2536.13" dur="7.41">never got probable cause on Trump</text>
  <text start="2539.36" dur="7.45">because Trump wasn&amp;#39;t dirty but Trump has</text>
  <text start="2543.54" dur="5.4">tons of probable cause on all the deep</text>
  <text start="2546.81" dur="4.26">state actors because they&amp;#39;ve all been</text>
  <text start="2548.94" dur="4.17">they&amp;#39;ve been lying they had been</text>
  <text start="2551.07" dur="5.16">falsifying records they have been</text>
  <text start="2553.11" dur="5.61">involved in blackmail extortion probably</text>
  <text start="2556.23" dur="4.5">murder obstruction of justice there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2558.72" dur="4.56">probable cause for all these people the</text>
  <text start="2560.73" dur="3.81">criminals the banking of the money</text>
  <text start="2563.28" dur="4.65">laundering</text>
  <text start="2564.54" dur="4.86">human trafficking Trump and Jeff</text>
  <text start="2567.93" dur="3.42">Sessions in the Justice Department have</text>
  <text start="2569.4" dur="5.19">probable cause on most of those people</text>
  <text start="2571.35" dur="5.88">all they need to do is take the probable</text>
  <text start="2574.59" dur="4.74">cause get an affidavit take it to a</text>
  <text start="2577.23" dur="3.87">court get a judge to sign it they go</text>
  <text start="2579.33" dur="3.33">into the NSA database and get all the</text>
  <text start="2581.1" dur="6.15">information they want and they prosecute</text>
  <text start="2582.66" dur="7.89">these people that is what I think we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2587.25" dur="6.06">gonna see in the next six months we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2590.55" dur="6.63">going to see the power of that NSA</text>
  <text start="2593.31" dur="4.8">database being used against the people</text>
  <text start="2597.18" dur="4.47">who created it</text>
  <text start="2598.11" dur="6.6">that is why Brennan and clapper and Ben</text>
  <text start="2601.65" dur="5.28">Rhodes and Susan Rice and yes former</text>
  <text start="2604.71" dur="4.71">President Obama and Hillary are freaking</text>
  <text start="2606.93" dur="6.09">out they are freaking out because they</text>
  <text start="2609.42" dur="7.59">know that monster that they created is</text>
  <text start="2613.02" dur="10.92">gonna come back and get them and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2617.01" dur="8.58">what I see going on so that&amp;#39;s the danger</text>
  <text start="2623.94" dur="3.3">of creating a monster the monster may</text>
  <text start="2625.59" dur="4.1">turn around and come after you if it</text>
  <text start="2627.24" dur="8.94">gets into the hands of the wrong person</text>
  <text start="2629.69" dur="11.95">so we&amp;#39;ll see how that works out I&amp;#39;ve got</text>
