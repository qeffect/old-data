  <text start="19.939" dur="4.621">for tuning in my message today is going</text>
  <text start="22.189" dur="4.59">to be one that is a little uncomfortable</text>
  <text start="24.56" dur="6.6">for me it&amp;#39;s going to be a short message</text>
  <text start="26.779" dur="6.721">I want to outline today the services</text>
  <text start="31.16" dur="4.95">that I have to offer people who come to</text>
  <text start="33.5" dur="4.76">my website who know me as a friend or as</text>
  <text start="36.11" dur="4.26">a mentor there is a lot of</text>
  <text start="38.26" dur="4.54">misunderstanding about exactly what it</text>
  <text start="40.37" dur="4.86">is I have to offer so today I&amp;#39;d like to</text>
  <text start="42.8" dur="4.56">clarify what it is i can offer you if</text>
  <text start="45.23" dur="3.929">you&amp;#39;ve listened to my podcast and read</text>
  <text start="47.36" dur="3.72">my books you know that i&amp;#39;m pretty big on</text>
  <text start="49.159" dur="4.591">healing i wrote a book on divine healing</text>
  <text start="51.08" dur="4.829">i teach on physical healing emotional</text>
  <text start="53.75" dur="4.5">healing I teach on deliverance these</text>
  <text start="55.909" dur="3.72">things are very important to me and one</text>
  <text start="58.25" dur="4.29">of my favorite scripture verses is</text>
  <text start="59.629" dur="5.1">Matthew 10 verses 7 and 8 as you go</text>
  <text start="62.54" dur="4.32">preach saying the kingdom of heaven is</text>
  <text start="64.729" dur="4.741">at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers</text>
  <text start="66.86" dur="4.74">raise the dead cast out demons these are</text>
  <text start="69.47" dur="4.98">the things that I teach people to do now</text>
  <text start="71.6" dur="6.12">I receive a lot of emails and private</text>
  <text start="74.45" dur="5.7">messages where people asked me to pray</text>
  <text start="77.72" dur="5.28">for them for healing physical healing or</text>
  <text start="80.15" dur="5.61">emotional healing or deliverance and I</text>
  <text start="83" dur="5.61">always honor prayer requests when I</text>
  <text start="85.76" dur="6.09">receive them however I want to make</text>
  <text start="88.61" dur="6.45">clear what the main focus of my ministry</text>
  <text start="91.85" dur="4.86">is when Jesus gave the disciples this</text>
  <text start="95.06" dur="3.99">commission that&amp;#39;s recorded in Matthew</text>
  <text start="96.71" dur="4.56">chapter 10 and he was talking about the</text>
  <text start="99.05" dur="5.73">things as they should do for people who</text>
  <text start="101.27" dur="5.22">were unfamiliar with the gospel who did</text>
  <text start="104.78" dur="3.54">not know the gospel of grace who did not</text>
  <text start="106.49" dur="3.75">know the power of God so the disciples</text>
  <text start="108.32" dur="5.1">went out and they&amp;#39;re going to use</text>
  <text start="110.24" dur="5.61">demonstrations of power to reveal the</text>
  <text start="113.42" dur="5.82">nature of God and his kingdom this was</text>
  <text start="115.85" dur="6.629">to unbelievers my commission comes from</text>
  <text start="119.24" dur="5.82">Ephesians chapter 4 verses 11 and 12</text>
  <text start="122.479" dur="4.831">speaking of Jesus Paul wrote and he</text>
  <text start="125.06" dur="4.86">himself gave some to be apostles some</text>
  <text start="127.31" dur="4.89">prophets some evangelists some pastors</text>
  <text start="129.92" dur="4.14">and teachers for the equipping the</text>
  <text start="132.2" dur="3.869">Saints for the work of the ministry for</text>
  <text start="134.06" dur="5.61">the edifying of the body of Christ that</text>
  <text start="136.069" dur="6.721">is where I take my commission from my</text>
  <text start="139.67" dur="6.569">main ministry is not focused on healing</text>
  <text start="142.79" dur="5.819">other people and this is the first thing</text>
  <text start="146.239" dur="3.931">I&amp;#39;d like to clarify when I receive</text>
  <text start="148.609" dur="2.371">emails and private messages from people</text>
  <text start="150.17" dur="2.61">many</text>
  <text start="150.98" dur="3.27">write to me and say you have such a</text>
  <text start="152.78" dur="3.48">great healing anointing could you please</text>
  <text start="154.25" dur="4.379">pray for me to be healed well as I said</text>
  <text start="156.26" dur="4.11">I always honor prayer requests and I</text>
  <text start="158.629" dur="4.651">will pray for anyone who sends a request</text>
  <text start="160.37" dur="5.67">to me but I do want people to understand</text>
  <text start="163.28" dur="5.849">that praying for other people to be</text>
  <text start="166.04" dur="5.4">healed is not my main ministry I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="169.129" dur="4.351">spend a lot of time praying for an</text>
  <text start="171.44" dur="4.98">individual to be healed when someone</text>
  <text start="173.48" dur="4.92">sends me a prayer request I don&amp;#39;t spend</text>
  <text start="176.42" dur="4.739">enough time to get a word of knowledge I</text>
  <text start="178.4" dur="4.679">don&amp;#39;t usually spend time enough to get</text>
  <text start="181.159" dur="4.92">revelation from God about specific</text>
  <text start="183.079" dur="6">things most of the time when i receive a</text>
  <text start="186.079" dur="5.22">prayer request i pray it&amp;#39;s very short</text>
  <text start="189.079" dur="5.311">and i go on to the next prayer request</text>
  <text start="191.299" dur="5.821">because in any given day I receive a lot</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="5.04">of requests and I can&amp;#39;t spend as much</text>
  <text start="197.12" dur="5.67">time as some people would praying for</text>
  <text start="199.43" dur="5.61">each individual person so if you send me</text>
  <text start="202.79" dur="4.41">a request and you asked me to pray for</text>
  <text start="205.04" dur="5.16">you just know that I will pray for you</text>
  <text start="207.2" dur="5.099">but generally speaking I&amp;#39;m not going to</text>
  <text start="210.2" dur="4.8">get back to you and give you specific</text>
  <text start="212.299" dur="4.62">revelation I don&amp;#39;t generally keep track</text>
  <text start="215" dur="3.51">of or write down the things that I see</text>
  <text start="216.919" dur="4.32">are the things that the Lord shows me I</text>
  <text start="218.51" dur="5.37">just pray as I&amp;#39;m LED and that&amp;#39;s it and I</text>
  <text start="221.239" dur="5.61">go on to the next one again my ministry</text>
  <text start="223.88" dur="6.12">is not primarily a prayer ministry my</text>
  <text start="226.849" dur="4.95">ministry is a teaching ministry there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="230" dur="4.56">only one or two people that I pray for</text>
  <text start="231.799" dur="5.91">on a regular basis I have a friend named</text>
  <text start="234.56" dur="4.95">Ravi Kapoor who has been a friend of</text>
  <text start="237.709" dur="4.021">mine on facebook for many years and</text>
  <text start="239.51" dur="4.83">Robbie and I pray for each other not</text>
  <text start="241.73" dur="4.68">daily but very often other than Ravi</text>
  <text start="244.34" dur="4.5">there aren&amp;#39;t very many people I pray for</text>
  <text start="246.41" dur="4.859">on a regular basis like I said if you</text>
  <text start="248.84" dur="4.829">send me a message I will pray for you</text>
  <text start="251.269" dur="4.08">but please don&amp;#39;t send me a message</text>
  <text start="253.669" dur="4.32">saying would you please pray for me</text>
  <text start="255.349" dur="4.591">every day because I received hundreds of</text>
  <text start="257.989" dur="4.261">emails private messages and I cannot</text>
  <text start="259.94" dur="4.94">keep track of everyone who needs prayer</text>
  <text start="262.25" dur="4.68">every day I&amp;#39;m not an intercessor so</text>
  <text start="264.88" dur="3.94">unfortunately you can&amp;#39;t expect me to</text>
  <text start="266.93" dur="4.739">pray for two or three hours over your</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="4.71">situation I love intercessors I think</text>
  <text start="271.669" dur="5.161">they&amp;#39;re amazing but I am NOT an</text>
  <text start="273.53" dur="5.16">intercessor I&amp;#39;m a teacher so if you do</text>
  <text start="276.83" dur="4.23">send me a prayer request just realize i</text>
  <text start="278.69" dur="4.229">will honor it it&amp;#39;s going to be short the</text>
  <text start="281.06" dur="3.27">funny thing is even though i often pray</text>
  <text start="282.919" dur="3.24">very short prayers</text>
  <text start="284.33" dur="3.149">we do receive back some incredible</text>
  <text start="286.159" dur="3.301">testimonies of people who have been</text>
  <text start="287.479" dur="3.631">healed occasionally financial and legal</text>
  <text start="289.46" dur="3.54">breakthroughs I don&amp;#39;t want to give you</text>
  <text start="291.11" dur="3.869">the impression that my prayers aren&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="293" dur="4.65">effective they just tend to be very</text>
  <text start="294.979" dur="5.25">short I also occasionally receive</text>
  <text start="297.65" dur="4.889">requests for deliverance and any people</text>
  <text start="300.229" dur="5.46">to know again my main ministry is not</text>
  <text start="302.539" dur="5.521">deliverance only occasionally do i do</text>
  <text start="305.689" dur="3.991">personal deliverance and it&amp;#39;s usually</text>
  <text start="308.06" dur="4.56">with a friend someone I&amp;#39;ve known for a</text>
  <text start="309.68" dur="4.53">while if you have a request or a need</text>
  <text start="312.62" dur="3.78">for deliverance and you send me a</text>
  <text start="314.21" dur="3.72">message generally speaking I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="316.4" dur="3.6">refer you to someone who has a</text>
  <text start="317.93" dur="4.68">deliverance ministry and that&amp;#39;s what</text>
  <text start="320" dur="5.28">they do full time and the same thing is</text>
  <text start="322.61" dur="4.89">true for emotional healing although I do</text>
  <text start="325.28" dur="3.78">some emotional healing again it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="327.5" dur="4.02">generally with friends or people that I</text>
  <text start="329.06" dur="4.409">know it&amp;#39;s not all that frequent and</text>
  <text start="331.52" dur="4.109">these people are essentially guinea pigs</text>
  <text start="333.469" dur="4.341">or I&amp;#39;m trying to learn new techniques</text>
  <text start="335.629" dur="4.921">for emotional healing if you need</text>
  <text start="337.81" dur="4.9">emotional healing I&amp;#39;m probably going to</text>
  <text start="340.55" dur="4.35">refer you to someone who does this full</text>
  <text start="342.71" dur="5.13">time or has a lot more free time to do</text>
  <text start="344.9" dur="5.009">it when a blind man was asked by Jesus</text>
  <text start="347.84" dur="4.41">what do you want he said I want to be</text>
  <text start="349.909" dur="5.82">able to see Jesus gave him his sight he</text>
  <text start="352.25" dur="5.789">generally gave according to precisely</text>
  <text start="355.729" dur="3.9">what a person asked for and that is how</text>
  <text start="358.039" dur="4.261">I respond to people when they contact me</text>
  <text start="359.629" dur="3.84">if someone has a headache and they want</text>
  <text start="362.3" dur="3.45">me to pray for their headache to go away</text>
  <text start="363.469" dur="3.391">that&amp;#39;s exactly what I&amp;#39;m going to do I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="365.75" dur="3.479">going to pray for their headache to go</text>
  <text start="366.86" dur="4.709">away if someone contacts name says they</text>
  <text start="369.229" dur="4.351">want to learn how to make other people&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="371.569" dur="4.56">headaches go away that is a completely</text>
  <text start="373.58" dur="4.38">different question and I will spend a</text>
  <text start="376.129" dur="4.65">lot more time and give that person</text>
  <text start="377.96" dur="5.19">resources and information so that they</text>
  <text start="380.779" dur="5.04">can pray effectively and make other</text>
  <text start="383.15" dur="4.71">people&amp;#39;s pain go away I think it&amp;#39;s said</text>
  <text start="385.819" dur="4.861">that many times we ask for the wrong</text>
  <text start="387.86" dur="4.979">things instead of asking to be trained</text>
  <text start="390.68" dur="4.829">and taught how to do things we simply</text>
  <text start="392.839" dur="4.681">ask a person to do it for us and then</text>
  <text start="395.509" dur="3.511">next week we have to ask them to do it</text>
  <text start="397.52" dur="3.269">again we never learn how to do it</text>
  <text start="399.02" dur="4.199">ourselves that&amp;#39;s why I think it&amp;#39;s much</text>
  <text start="400.789" dur="5.3">more valuable to spend my time teaching</text>
  <text start="403.219" dur="5.971">people the nature of my ministry is</text>
  <text start="406.089" dur="5.591">teaching it&amp;#39;s not really healing or</text>
  <text start="409.19" dur="4.44">deliverance I am a teacher I&amp;#39;m much</text>
  <text start="411.68" dur="4.349">better at teaching than I am at doing I</text>
  <text start="413.63" dur="4.75">can teach people to do things I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="416.029" dur="4.961">even do myself when my children were</text>
  <text start="418.38" dur="4.29">we used to go to the Oregon coast one</text>
  <text start="420.99" dur="4.23">day the kids decided they wanted to go</text>
  <text start="422.67" dur="5.13">surfing now I&amp;#39;d never been surfing but</text>
  <text start="425.22" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;d watched a lot of surfers and I</text>
  <text start="427.8" dur="5.64">decided to rent a surfboard for the kids</text>
  <text start="429.9" dur="5.16">I knew enough about watching surfers</text>
  <text start="433.44" dur="4.2">that I thought I could teach my kids how</text>
  <text start="435.06" dur="6.18">to surf so I spent a day showing the</text>
  <text start="437.64" dur="6.09">kids how to read the waves how to get up</text>
  <text start="441.24" dur="4.92">on the board how to paddle it with the</text>
  <text start="443.73" dur="4.44">waves and then how stand up on it we</text>
  <text start="446.16" dur="3.51">practice this for hours and hours and by</text>
  <text start="448.17" dur="4.32">the end of the day the kids are actually</text>
  <text start="449.67" dur="4.95">able to surf pretty well considering</text>
  <text start="452.49" dur="4.83">that it only been doing it one day it</text>
  <text start="454.62" dur="5.31">was then that I realized my real gift is</text>
  <text start="457.32" dur="4.68">teaching I can teach people to do things</text>
  <text start="459.93" dur="4.65">I can&amp;#39;t even do myself because I analyze</text>
  <text start="462" dur="4.17">the process of how these things work and</text>
  <text start="464.58" dur="3.24">I can explain it to other people and</text>
  <text start="466.17" dur="3.45">show them and demonstrate it even though</text>
  <text start="467.82" dur="4.02">I may not be able to do it myself you</text>
  <text start="469.62" dur="4.23">might call that an unusual gift but that</text>
  <text start="471.84" dur="4.4">is what I do I&amp;#39;m very good at teaching</text>
  <text start="473.85" dur="5.13">so if you are a person who needs</text>
  <text start="476.24" dur="5.14">instruction I am the person that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="478.98" dur="5.79">looking for if you are a person who</text>
  <text start="481.38" dur="6.03">needs a lot of daily prayer I am</text>
  <text start="484.77" dur="4.8">probably not the best person some people</text>
  <text start="487.41" dur="5.64">will ask me well why don&amp;#39;t I emphasize</text>
  <text start="489.57" dur="6.12">praying in my ministry what about James</text>
  <text start="493.05" dur="4.89">chapter 5 verse 14 is anyone among you</text>
  <text start="495.69" dur="4.02">sick let him call for the elders of the</text>
  <text start="497.94" dur="3.69">church and let them pray over him</text>
  <text start="499.71" dur="3.63">anointing him with oil in the name of</text>
  <text start="501.63" dur="3.21">the Lord doesn&amp;#39;t that mean that we</text>
  <text start="503.34" dur="3.63">should pray for each other it absolutely</text>
  <text start="504.84" dur="4.74">means it should pray for each other I do</text>
  <text start="506.97" dur="4.23">pray for other people and sometimes I</text>
  <text start="509.58" dur="3.48">lay hands on them and sometimes i&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="511.2" dur="4.74">anoint them with oil but these are</text>
  <text start="513.06" dur="5.13">people that are in my fellowship in my</text>
  <text start="515.94" dur="4.95">circle of friends the admonition from</text>
  <text start="518.19" dur="4.8">James here is for people in a</text>
  <text start="520.89" dur="4.47">congregation to call for the elders of</text>
  <text start="522.99" dur="4.65">that congregation not to go to a</text>
  <text start="525.36" dur="3.6">stranger or someone on the other side of</text>
  <text start="527.64" dur="3.93">the world and say hey can you get me</text>
  <text start="528.96" dur="4.32">healed now I realized that many people</text>
  <text start="531.57" dur="4.65">don&amp;#39;t have a regular church that they</text>
  <text start="533.28" dur="5.07">attend I don&amp;#39;t have one either but I do</text>
  <text start="536.22" dur="5.52">have a lot of good leaving friends who</text>
  <text start="538.35" dur="5.49">are qualified as elders and today with</text>
  <text start="541.74" dur="3.87">social media you can get connected to</text>
  <text start="543.84" dur="4.11">any one of thousands of groups of people</text>
  <text start="545.61" dur="4.17">on facebook on other social media</text>
  <text start="547.95" dur="4.45">platforms there really is no reason to</text>
  <text start="549.78" dur="4.51">be isolated from a body a believer</text>
  <text start="552.4" dur="4.05">I do most of my fellowship online I</text>
  <text start="554.29" dur="4.11">receive prayer from a lot of my friends</text>
  <text start="556.45" dur="4.08">I receive counsel I received teaching</text>
  <text start="558.4" dur="4.62">and instruction from people who are more</text>
  <text start="560.53" dur="4.41">mature than me and i have received</text>
  <text start="563.02" dur="4.37">prayer from them and i have been healed</text>
  <text start="564.94" dur="4.92">so if you&amp;#39;re a person who is looking for</text>
  <text start="567.39" dur="4.84">instruction and living the supernatural</text>
  <text start="569.86" dur="4.68">life and healing and deliverance and</text>
  <text start="572.23" dur="3.96">emotional healing and singing the spirit</text>
  <text start="574.54" dur="3.6">travelling spirit if you want</text>
