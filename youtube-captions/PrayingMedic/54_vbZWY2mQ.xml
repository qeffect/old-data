  <text start="74.04" dur="4.86">trying to understand what Nancy Pelosi&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="76.02" dur="4.8">endgame was regarding her strange movies</text>
  <text start="78.9" dur="5.37">related to the impeachment of President</text>
  <text start="80.82" dur="5.24">Trump this broadcast is going to I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="84.27" dur="4.62">share some of my observations on what</text>
  <text start="86.06" dur="5.68">goal I believe her strategies and</text>
  <text start="88.89" dur="5.519">tactics are pointing to ever since</text>
  <text start="91.74" dur="6.089">Donald Trump was elected the Doucet has</text>
  <text start="94.409" dur="7.441">been on defense no one expected Hillary</text>
  <text start="97.829" dur="7.32">to lose that&amp;#39;s the biggie q posted this</text>
  <text start="101.85" dur="6.03">back in November of 2017</text>
  <text start="105.149" dur="4.4">y hours after the election did seven</text>
  <text start="107.88" dur="4.59">people travel to an undisclosed location</text>
  <text start="109.549" dur="5.1">to hold a very private and highly secure</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="4.59">guarded meeting</text>
  <text start="114.649" dur="4.15">why didn&amp;#39;t Hillary give a concession</text>
  <text start="117.06" dur="3.39">speech when was the last time a</text>
  <text start="118.799" dur="5.82">presidential candidate didn&amp;#39;t personally</text>
  <text start="120.45" dur="6.449">give a concession speech so the night of</text>
  <text start="124.619" dur="3.721">the election they all got shocked they</text>
  <text start="126.899" dur="3.871">were stunned and they had to start</text>
  <text start="128.34" dur="4.67">making plans and I believe this private</text>
  <text start="130.77" dur="6.62">meeting was the beginning of their plan</text>
  <text start="133.01" dur="6.149">since they were on defense what do you</text>
  <text start="137.39" dur="4.11">do when your plans go horribly wrong</text>
  <text start="139.159" dur="4.44">well the deep state knew it could not</text>
  <text start="141.5" dur="4.709">reverse the outcome of the election so</text>
  <text start="143.599" dur="5.851">it opted for Plan B the Muller</text>
  <text start="146.209" dur="6.06">investigation was created as a blockade</text>
  <text start="149.45" dur="5">to prevent Donald Trump from doing the</text>
  <text start="152.269" dur="4.86">things that he needed to do q has</text>
  <text start="154.45" dur="5.71">complied many times that the Muller</text>
  <text start="157.129" dur="4.14">investigation was a blockade he was</text>
  <text start="160.16" dur="3.659">designed to limit the president&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="161.269" dur="4.261">ability to maneuver designed to stall</text>
  <text start="163.819" dur="3.571">for time until the midterm elections in</text>
  <text start="165.53" dur="4.97">2018</text>
  <text start="167.39" dur="6.959">it was designed to terminate house</text>
  <text start="170.5" dur="5.23">ongoing investigations and there&amp;#39;s a lot</text>
  <text start="174.349" dur="6.411">of different reasons why they created</text>
  <text start="175.73" dur="7.619">the Muller investigation for all we know</text>
  <text start="180.76" dur="5.5">they may still have had the Muller</text>
  <text start="183.349" dur="6.271">investigation going on currently if the</text>
  <text start="186.26" dur="8.13">president had not found a way to stop</text>
  <text start="189.62" dur="6.959">the investigation however the president</text>
  <text start="194.39" dur="5.64">was able to get the Muller investigation</text>
  <text start="196.579" dur="6.871">to come to a halt and I believe that</text>
  <text start="200.03" dur="6.42">came when Bill Barr took over as</text>
  <text start="203.45" dur="5.7">Attorney General Barr was able to impose</text>
  <text start="206.45" dur="4.74">his view of the obstruction of justice</text>
  <text start="209.15" dur="5.489">statute on Muller&amp;#39;s investigation</text>
  <text start="211.19" dur="5.34">effectively bringing it to an end so the</text>
  <text start="214.639" dur="4.621">president can&amp;#39;t allow the Justice</text>
  <text start="216.53" dur="5.37">Department to begin arresting criminals</text>
  <text start="219.26" dur="4.289">in the deep state as long as he is under</text>
  <text start="221.9" dur="4.169">public suspicion of committing crimes</text>
  <text start="223.549" dur="4.861">himself and the Muller investigation one</text>
  <text start="226.069" dur="6.14">of the goals of that investigation was</text>
  <text start="228.41" dur="7.71">to make the public think that Trump was</text>
  <text start="232.209" dur="7.81">committing crimes so when the Muller</text>
  <text start="236.12" dur="6.72">blockade was removed and Trump was no</text>
  <text start="240.019" dur="4.62">longer under criminal suspicion he could</text>
  <text start="242.84" dur="3.929">begin discussing the criminal activities</text>
  <text start="244.639" dur="4.921">of the deep state therefore Nancy</text>
  <text start="246.769" dur="5.491">Pelosi&amp;#39;s new plan would be to keep him</text>
  <text start="249.56" dur="7.859">under criminal suspicion that would</text>
  <text start="252.26" dur="7.65">delay him from pursuing the prosecution</text>
  <text start="257.419" dur="5.341">of real criminals so that for the next</text>
  <text start="259.91" dur="6.12">phase Nancy Pelosi recruited Adam Schiff</text>
  <text start="262.76" dur="3.8">Jerry Nadler members of Democrat members</text>
  <text start="266.03" dur="3.29">of Congress</text>
  <text start="266.56" dur="5.25">to use their platforms to continually</text>
  <text start="269.32" dur="5.43">suggest that trump is a lawless tyrant</text>
  <text start="271.81" dur="5.7">that is what the impeachment hoax is</text>
  <text start="274.75" dur="5.85">about it&amp;#39;s a smear campaign it is aimed</text>
  <text start="277.51" dur="6.39">at making Trump look evil dishonest and</text>
  <text start="280.6" dur="7.14">the media of course is quite compliant</text>
  <text start="283.9" dur="6.72">with that agenda but the impeachment</text>
  <text start="287.74" dur="5.07">hoax has another objective one of its</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="5.49">objectives is to paralyze the Senate</text>
  <text start="292.81" dur="5.04">chuck Grassley is a smart guy he knows</text>
  <text start="296.11" dur="3.57">the policies threat to withhold the</text>
  <text start="297.85" dur="3.539">articles of impeachment is intended to</text>
  <text start="299.68" dur="4.41">script the Senate&amp;#39;s ability to schedule</text>
  <text start="301.389" dur="5.521">important meetings in a tweet he</text>
  <text start="304.09" dur="6.75">specifically mentioned the likelihood</text>
  <text start="306.91" dur="5.7">that the house and Nancy Pelosi</text>
  <text start="310.84" dur="3">specifically because she didn&amp;#39;t get</text>
  <text start="312.61" dur="2.67">permission from the house to do this</text>
  <text start="313.84" dur="3.87">she&amp;#39;s doing a lot of this just</text>
  <text start="315.28" dur="4.74">unilaterally she didn&amp;#39;t ask for a House</text>
  <text start="317.71" dur="3.6">vote to go into the impeachment inquiry</text>
  <text start="320.02" dur="4.68">she just decided they were gonna do it</text>
  <text start="321.31" dur="5.04">and now she unilaterally decided to</text>
  <text start="324.7" dur="3.81">withhold the he heard calls of a</text>
  <text start="326.35" dur="3.539">Pietschmann from the Senate so Chuck</text>
  <text start="328.51" dur="2.85">Grassley pointed out that it looks like</text>
  <text start="329.889" dur="4.801">it&amp;#39;s an attempt to mess with the</text>
  <text start="331.36" dur="5.28">schedule Senate can&amp;#39;t schedule anything</text>
  <text start="334.69" dur="3.51">with the Supreme Court Justice Roberts</text>
  <text start="336.64" dur="3.75">would have to preside over an</text>
  <text start="338.2" dur="3.75">impeachment and they can&amp;#39;t schedule at</text>
  <text start="340.39" dur="2.94">as long as they don&amp;#39;t know when the</text>
  <text start="341.95" dur="3.3">articles of impeachment are coming over</text>
  <text start="343.33" dur="5.76">that also creates a lot of other</text>
  <text start="345.25" dur="5.07">problems as long as Pelosi because</text>
  <text start="349.09" dur="7.17">withholding the articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="350.32" dur="7.77">the Senate can&amp;#39;t schedule hearings they</text>
  <text start="356.26" dur="6.48">can&amp;#39;t schedule with the Supreme Court</text>
  <text start="358.09" dur="7.079">Justice Roberts q you posted this on the</text>
  <text start="362.74" dur="4.89">22nd why are the two articles of</text>
  <text start="365.169" dur="5.161">impeachment being held by Pelosi well</text>
  <text start="367.63" dur="4.65">holding the articles actually impact the</text>
  <text start="370.33" dur="3.809">decision of the Senate no while holding</text>
  <text start="372.28" dur="5.16">actually provide a better scenario</text>
  <text start="374.139" dur="6.421">public opinion for Dems No well holding</text>
  <text start="377.44" dur="3.96">them actually sway elect senators to</text>
  <text start="380.56" dur="3.93">change their vote</text>
  <text start="381.4" dur="5.67">no when blackmail and threats no longer</text>
  <text start="384.49" dur="4.83">work why are the two articles being held</text>
  <text start="387.07" dur="3.87">by Pelosi what happens when the articles</text>
  <text start="389.32" dur="3.569">of impeachment are sent from the house</text>
  <text start="390.94" dur="5.099">to the Senate can the Senate conduct</text>
  <text start="392.889" dur="4.981">other business during that time no what</text>
  <text start="396.039" dur="4.231">value might exist by holding the</text>
  <text start="397.87" dur="5.22">articles I believe the value</text>
  <text start="400.27" dur="3.96">is to delay every all the business that</text>
  <text start="403.09" dur="3.63">the Senate needs to do</text>
  <text start="404.23" dur="4.8">how long do Senate impeachment trials</text>
  <text start="406.72" dur="4.26">normally take it can take months</text>
  <text start="409.03" dur="5.13">what statements have been made regarding</text>
  <text start="410.98" dur="5.01">the timing think fast tracking which</text>
  <text start="414.16" dur="4.35">McConnell Senate majority leader has</text>
  <text start="415.99" dur="4.46">been talking about either immediately</text>
  <text start="418.51" dur="4.11">dismissing the articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="420.45" dur="3.69">after hearing the opening statements or</text>
  <text start="422.62" dur="4.05">fast tracking it</text>
  <text start="424.14" dur="5.38">what statements have been made by</text>
  <text start="426.67" dur="5.1">Chairman Graham regarding Senate FISA</text>
  <text start="429.52" dur="3.56">hearings and witnesses wise Pelosi</text>
  <text start="431.77" dur="4.47">holding the articles of impeachment</text>
  <text start="433.08" dur="7.17">right so Q here is implying that this is</text>
  <text start="436.24" dur="6.99">all about messing with Lindsey Graham&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="440.25" dur="4.78">hearings regarding FISA abuse and the</text>
  <text start="443.23" dur="3.48">witnesses he wants to call Lindsey</text>

  <text start="461.44" dur="15.03">video so q posted a link to that tweet</text>
  <text start="473.86" dur="4.41">why is Pelosi holding the two articles</text>
  <text start="476.47" dur="3.54">of impeachment how do you introduce the</text>
  <text start="478.27" dur="4.08">truth about what happened to the public</text>
  <text start="480.01" dur="5.04">that would be through Senate hearings</text>
  <text start="482.35" dur="4.65">that it would be televised what value</text>
  <text start="485.05" dur="4.83">might exist by attempting to block</text>
  <text start="487" dur="4.77">public testimony hearings with educating</text>
  <text start="489.88" dur="3.87">the public through the Senate prior to</text>
  <text start="491.77" dur="4.59">Barr Durham and Huber released be</text>
  <text start="493.75" dur="3.96">important narratives are created and</text>
  <text start="496.36" dur="3.45">pushed to prevent the public from</text>
  <text start="497.71" dur="2.46">discovering the truth enemy of the</text>
  <text start="499.81" dur="4.95">people</text>
  <text start="500.17" dur="6.72">so the Great Awakening is the awakening</text>
  <text start="504.76" dur="5.52">the awareness of the public to the</text>
  <text start="506.89" dur="5.61">crimes of people in government and I</text>

  <text start="536.29" dur="6.12">exposure of corruption through Senate</text>
  <text start="538.36" dur="6.3">hearings I expect the mainstream media</text>
  <text start="542.41" dur="3.92">not to broadcast these hearings because</text>

  <text start="2226.32" dur="4.26">clear with our audience what you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2227.97" dur="4.26">saying is not just that the President</text>

  <text start="2236.7" dur="7.53">hacking in to the DNC&amp;#39;s servers why</text>
  <text start="2242.07" dur="4.05">would you call that into question since</text>
  <text start="2244.23" dur="6.95">every smart person in Washington knows</text>
  <text start="2246.12" dur="7.53">that happened well okay I give up no</text>
  <text start="2251.18" dur="4.39">first of all when this first came out</text>
  <text start="2253.65" dur="4.8">last year about a year ago I started</text>
  <text start="2255.57" dur="4.71">opposing that simply because of the way</text>
  <text start="2258.45" dur="4.35">the intelligence community was talking</text>
  <text start="2260.28" dur="4.53">and knowing that the NSA for example has</text>
  <text start="2262.8" dur="3.57">all the fiber-optic taps across the</text>
  <text start="2264.81" dur="4.02">United States and even around the world</text>
  <text start="2266.37" dur="4.35">plus straight traceroute programs</text>
  <text start="2268.83" dur="4.61">embedded in hundreds of places all over</text>
  <text start="2270.72" dur="4.89">the network so I knew they would know if</text>
  <text start="2273.44" dur="4.66">packets were being passed around the</text>
  <text start="2275.61" dur="4.23">u.s. or outside the US or anywhere in</text>
  <text start="2278.1" dur="3.3">the world they could trace them and see</text>
  <text start="2279.84" dur="3.12">who got them I mean they did that</text>
  <text start="2281.4" dur="3.03">several years ago with the Chinese hack</text>
  <text start="2282.96" dur="4.23">they came in and said it came from that</text>
  <text start="2284.43" dur="4.08">building I think in Shanghai well they</text>
  <text start="2287.19" dur="4.2">could do the same thing with virtually</text>
  <text start="2288.51" dur="4.65">any hack so Mike right away I began to</text>
  <text start="2291.39" dur="5.46">question that assertion that they were</text>
  <text start="2293.16" dur="7.8">hacking into the DNC and then we had</text>
  <text start="2296.85" dur="5.97">some a fellow who basically had access</text>
  <text start="2300.96" dur="5.52">it seems to me yet have access to the</text>
  <text start="2302.82" dur="5.97">network log of the DNC server which</text>
  <text start="2306.48" dur="4.67">means that any transactions going into</text>
  <text start="2308.79" dur="5.31">and out of the DNC network log get</text>
  <text start="2311.15" dur="5.59">registered or in log inside that logon</text>
  <text start="2314.1" dur="4.17">that goes into a list of what packets</text>
  <text start="2316.74" dur="5.4">come in from what IPs and so on and</text>
  <text start="2318.27" dur="7.23">going back and forth right so that that</text>
  <text start="2322.14" dur="5.22">that to me said that from there he</text>
  <text start="2325.5" dur="4.26">listed out the data the raw data from</text>
  <text start="2327.36" dur="4.62">the transactions in the log which meant</text>
  <text start="2329.76" dur="4.65">the time the transmission started the</text>
  <text start="2331.98" dur="4.47">time it ended amounts of date of the</text>
  <text start="2334.41" dur="5.189">past you know in the end</text>
  <text start="2336.45" dur="5.55">any other identifying bees are buried in</text>
  <text start="2339.599" dur="4.98">those packets that were passed to if an</text>
  <text start="2342" dur="3.869">assay would ever give them to you but I</text>
  <text start="2344.579" dur="3.091">think this is probably one of the</text>
  <text start="2345.869" dur="3.72">reasons the other the DNC didn&amp;#39;t let the</text>
  <text start="2347.67" dur="5.429">FBI look at it because it would show</text>
  <text start="2349.589" dur="9.26">king death at the rate C it was taken</text>
  <text start="2353.099" dur="10.77">out at the rate of 109 1976</text>
  <text start="2358.849" dur="7.151">megabytes or it was taking out and Andy</text>
  <text start="2363.869" dur="5.301">and you make the point 187 that moves</text>
  <text start="2366" dur="5.4">too fast right so we could be on out</text>
  <text start="2369.17" dur="4.449">over the internet it had to have been</text>
  <text start="2371.4" dur="4.41">taken directly in person from the</text>
  <text start="2373.619" dur="5">computer downloaded onto some sort of</text>
  <text start="2375.81" dur="6.48">mobile storage device so given that</text>
  <text start="2378.619" dur="5.171">given that the NSA clearly doesn&amp;#39;t have</text>
  <text start="2382.29" dur="2.97">the evidence it would have if it</text>
  <text start="2383.79" dur="4.71">happened and that it couldn&amp;#39;t have been</text>
  <text start="2385.26" dur="5.64">hacked over the Internet then why is</text>
  <text start="2388.5" dur="3.869">everyone in government still pretending</text>
  <text start="2390.9" dur="5.25">that&amp;#39;s what happened that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="2392.369" dur="6.031">confusing part to me well I guess it</text>
  <text start="2396.15" dur="5.55">appears that many people are emotionally</text>
  <text start="2398.4" dur="5.76">tied to this agenda to tie the Russians</text>
  <text start="2401.7" dur="4.409">with the President Trump and the Trump</text>
  <text start="2404.16" dur="4.32">administration one way or the other they</text>
  <text start="2406.109" dur="3.841">want to do it so they it&amp;#39;s hard for them</text>
  <text start="2408.48" dur="3.83">to give up that argument I mean it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2409.95" dur="6.18">like they&amp;#39;re emotionally stuck with it</text>
  <text start="2412.31" dur="6.43">so I mean we invest try to look at</text>
  <text start="2416.13" dur="5.13">things just straight forward what are</text>
  <text start="2418.74" dur="4.32">the facts find the exact the facts of</text>
  <text start="2421.26" dur="4.26">the case and and then make a decision</text>
  <text start="2423.06" dur="4.47">from that not from not from other</text>
  <text start="2425.52" dur="4.5">agendas driving us or anything that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2427.53" dur="6">motivating us to do or say things that</text>
  <text start="2430.02" dur="4.74">we can&amp;#39;t substantiate with facts so then</text>
  <text start="2433.53" dur="3.63">and that&amp;#39;s the problem you see</text>
  <text start="2434.76" dur="4.829">everything has come out about this issue</text>
  <text start="2437.16" dur="3.87">hasn&amp;#39;t been backed up by facts at all</text>
  <text start="2439.589" dur="3.091">the only facts we&amp;#39;ve been able to well</text>
  <text start="2441.03" dur="3.92">I&amp;#39;ve notice that so let me ask you one</text>
  <text start="2442.68" dur="4.889">last Fulton right there they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2444.95" dur="5.379">generalizations and you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="2447.569" dur="4.711">accept them and then be quiet and just</text>
  <text start="2450.329" dur="3.211">sort of obediently not and of course the</text>
  <text start="2452.28" dur="3.69">Intel community says it it must be true</text>
  <text start="2453.54" dur="5.4">as someone who worked in that community</text>
  <text start="2455.97" dur="5.31">for your entire adult life are you</text>
  <text start="2458.94" dur="4.139">struck by how all of a sudden people who</text>
  <text start="2461.28" dur="3.72">know nothing about how it works are</text>
  <text start="2463.079" dur="4.471">demanding that everyone else except</text>
  <text start="2465" dur="5.16">these assumptions that have no factual</text>
  <text start="2467.55" dur="4.049">basis yeah</text>
  <text start="2470.16" dur="4.439">well it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of hard to believe</text>
  <text start="2471.599" dur="5.881">but I guess they&amp;#39;re applying the old</text>
  <text start="2474.599" dur="4.621">Safa stick rule from from ancient Greece</text>
  <text start="2477.48" dur="3.42">you know when they they would say simply</text>

  <text start="2480.9" dur="3.359">from many different directions by many</text>
  <text start="2482.73" dur="3.96">different people and eventually gets</text>

  <text start="2490.74" dur="4.859">to make it a big one too this idea about</text>
  <text start="2493.619" dur="4.17">the Russia Russia hacking the server has</text>
  <text start="2495.599" dur="4.621">been pushed by the media for three years</text>
  <text start="2497.789" dur="4.681">many points out that if there was a hack</text>
  <text start="2500.22" dur="6.629">the NSA wouldn&amp;#39;t know about it because</text>
