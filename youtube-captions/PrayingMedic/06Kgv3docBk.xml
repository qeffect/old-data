  <text start="0.05" dur="4.479">all right now let&amp;#39;s talk about</text>
  <text start="2.129" dur="5.821">developing specific revelation in our</text>
  <text start="4.529" dur="8.4">lives developing specific revelation</text>
  <text start="7.95" dur="7.109">okay now when I mean by that is a lot of</text>
  <text start="12.929" dur="4.411">us believe there&amp;#39;s a theology out there</text>
  <text start="15.059" dur="4.651">that God is sovereign which that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="17.34" dur="4.83">obviously true but a lot of us assume</text>
  <text start="19.71" dur="4.47">the sovereignty means that we can&amp;#39;t ever</text>
  <text start="22.17" dur="4.109">ask God questions God just kind of</text>
  <text start="24.18" dur="3.54">governs the affairs of man and he</text>
  <text start="26.279" dur="3.061">doesn&amp;#39;t talk to you about it he doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="27.72" dur="3.469">invite you into any understanding he</text>
  <text start="29.34" dur="4.08">doesn&amp;#39;t say hey I want to I want to see</text>
  <text start="31.189" dur="3.611">what you think about this he just says</text>
  <text start="33.42" dur="3.06">I&amp;#39;m gonna do this you have no choice</text>
  <text start="34.8" dur="3.54">that&amp;#39;s a lot a lot of people have view</text>
  <text start="36.48" dur="4.11">that&amp;#39;s the sovereignty of God he&amp;#39;s just</text>
  <text start="38.34" dur="3.84">all-powerful he&amp;#39;s not relational and so</text>
  <text start="40.59" dur="2.64">he just kind of demands things and says</text>
  <text start="42.18" dur="4.77">it&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re gonna do and we just</text>
  <text start="43.23" dur="6.149">have to comply well problem is is in</text>
  <text start="46.95" dur="4.289">Scripture you see the son of God</text>
  <text start="49.379" dur="4.291">relating back and forth with his father</text>
  <text start="51.239" dur="3.721">talking with him about things answering</text>
  <text start="53.67" dur="3.15">questions you see in the book of Acts</text>
  <text start="54.96" dur="3.869">people arguing with God and saying you</text>
  <text start="56.82" dur="3.239">know I really don&amp;#39;t want to do that and</text>
  <text start="58.829" dur="4.4">the Lord coming back and going well you</text>
  <text start="60.059" dur="7.141">really don&amp;#39;t have a choice</text>
  <text start="63.229" dur="6.701">now if you see the sovereignty of God is</text>
  <text start="67.2" dur="5.22">being this abstract thing where it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="69.93" dur="3.81">relational base you&amp;#39;ll never dialogue</text>
  <text start="72.42" dur="2.61">with the Lord you&amp;#39;ll just feel like</text>
  <text start="73.74" dur="3.03">you&amp;#39;re a puppet and you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="75.03" dur="3.93">just kind of say it and do what God ever</text>
  <text start="76.77" dur="4.47">tells you to do there&amp;#39;s a relational</text>
  <text start="78.96" dur="4.199">dynamic of Revelation that God wants you</text>
  <text start="81.24" dur="4.32">to come into all right so we&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="83.159" dur="6.39">talk about developing specific areas</text>
  <text start="85.56" dur="7.169">okay when the presence of the Lord comes</text>
  <text start="89.549" dur="5.791">and he wants to start doing ministry</text>
  <text start="92.729" dur="4.801">what he does is he goes into the place</text>
  <text start="95.34" dur="5.15">of where your faith has been developed</text>
  <text start="97.53" dur="6.119">and he begins to speak to you there so</text>
  <text start="100.49" dur="5.26">when I prophesy over people this is just</text>
  <text start="103.649" dur="4.171">kind of my own soul I spent years</text>
  <text start="105.75" dur="4.14">studying spiritual gifts and and how it</text>
  <text start="107.82" dur="4.32">gifts work and how to teach people about</text>
  <text start="109.89" dur="3.99">spiritual gifts so when I&amp;#39;m just about</text>
  <text start="112.14" dur="3.479">to start prophesying to people the place</text>
  <text start="113.88" dur="3.39">I&amp;#39;m most familiar with the voice of the</text>
  <text start="115.619" dur="5.161">Lord is in that arena and so God just</text>
  <text start="117.27" dur="4.83">talks to me about giftedness first now I</text>
  <text start="120.78" dur="2.699">don&amp;#39;t know if you guys ever do this but</text>
  <text start="122.1" dur="2.82">I used to watch people and I listen to</text>
  <text start="123.479" dur="3.151">them prophesy and they&amp;#39;d start talking</text>
  <text start="124.92" dur="3.449">about what you&amp;#39;re wounded you need</text>
  <text start="126.63" dur="3.09">financial help and I think man I must</text>
  <text start="128.369" dur="3.661">not be as spiritual as this person</text>
  <text start="129.72" dur="3.989">because I don&amp;#39;t get that I get to do</text>
  <text start="132.03" dur="1.95">here&amp;#39;s what the Lord wants to do in your</text>
  <text start="133.709" dur="2.491">life</text>
  <text start="133.98" dur="5.28">here&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s after and alerted</text>
  <text start="136.2" dur="5.67">showing me that each one of us has a key</text>
  <text start="139.26" dur="4.08">of familiarity with the Lord that he</text>
  <text start="141.87" dur="5.46">started with and so you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="143.34" dur="6.99">cultivate that and recognize it okay so</text>
  <text start="147.33" dur="5.64">whatever Eragon starts with whether it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="150.33" dur="4.049">in the in the secular arena the idea of</text>
  <text start="152.97" dur="3.06">business or it has to do with their</text>
  <text start="154.379" dur="5.58">family or has to do with healing or</text>
  <text start="156.03" dur="6.45">whatever it is let God start developing</text>
  <text start="159.959" dur="6.03">Revelation in that arena first and then</text>
  <text start="162.48" dur="8.069">once his presence comes learn to dance</text>
  <text start="165.989" dur="7.351">with the Lord when he&amp;#39;s there okay so</text>
  <text start="170.549" dur="4.651">let&amp;#39;s talk about this this actually did</text>
  <text start="173.34" dur="4.739">happen I had an opportunity to travel</text>
  <text start="175.2" dur="4.349">with I&amp;#39;m gonna gems even though that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="178.079" dur="4.171">unfamiliar with me an opportunity to</text>
  <text start="179.549" dur="5.461">travel with James down to Guatemala and</text>
  <text start="182.25" dur="5.94">I got to go with him and his oldest son</text>
  <text start="185.01" dur="4.849">Justin and you&amp;#39;re not supposed to drink</text>
  <text start="188.19" dur="5.879">the water when you go down there right</text>
  <text start="189.859" dur="5.831">well so I did I I lived on coke I was</text>
  <text start="194.069" dur="3.841">disgusting I even brush my teeth with</text>
  <text start="195.69" dur="4.919">coke because I didn&amp;#39;t want to get the</text>
  <text start="197.91" dur="7.109">water but without thinking I ordered a</text>
  <text start="200.609" dur="6.981">solid and they washed it with water ate</text>
  <text start="205.019" dur="5.161">the solid and then this phenomenon</text>
  <text start="207.59" dur="6.97">started happening inside my stomach I</text>
  <text start="210.18" dur="6.45">got montezuma&amp;#39;s revenge both Justin and</text>
  <text start="214.56" dur="3.78">I did and so we would go to the meetings</text>
  <text start="216.63" dur="3.06">then the only time we didn&amp;#39;t when I</text>
  <text start="218.34" dur="3.81">don&amp;#39;t mean to be discussing but the only</text>
  <text start="219.69" dur="4.53">time we didn&amp;#39;t throw up or have other</text>
  <text start="222.15" dur="4.14">problems is when we were sitting in the</text>
  <text start="224.22" dur="4.23">meeting with the anointing there okay so</text>
  <text start="226.29" dur="6">I just wanted to be in meetings 24 hours</text>
  <text start="228.45" dur="5.939">a day and by the time the the meeting</text>
  <text start="232.29" dur="3.84">would end and I could sense the sort of</text>
  <text start="234.389" dur="3.871">diminishing of the presence of the Lord</text>
  <text start="236.13" dur="3.66">I just and I would look at each other</text>
  <text start="238.26" dur="3.629">and we would race as fast as we could to</text>
  <text start="239.79" dur="3.479">the bathroom it&amp;#39;s pretty disgusting and</text>
  <text start="241.889" dur="4.861">spent a whole week doing that that was</text>
  <text start="243.269" dur="4.321">really exciting so anyways what does</text>
  <text start="246.75" dur="2.91">that have to do with what I&amp;#39;m talking</text>
  <text start="247.59" dur="5.489">about well this is setting it up and so</text>
  <text start="249.66" dur="5.52">we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re having we&amp;#39;re watching Jimmy</text>
  <text start="253.079" dur="4.53">breakfast because we can&amp;#39;t eat and he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="255.18" dur="4.41">talking to me and he goes you know he</text>
  <text start="257.609" dur="3.84">goes Brian I&amp;#39;d like you to do an</text>
  <text start="259.59" dur="3.12">experiment I thought all right what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="261.449" dur="2.52">that and he said I don&amp;#39;t want you</text>
  <text start="262.71" dur="3.449">telling anybody their gifts anymore</text>
  <text start="263.969" dur="3.51">because God has more to talk to them and</text>
  <text start="266.159" dur="1.651">then about their gifts I want you to</text>
  <text start="267.479" dur="2.281">start</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="4.079">asking the Lord for more information or</text>
  <text start="269.76" dur="4.379">specific information okay</text>
  <text start="271.889" dur="4.561">now remember I told you we have a place</text>
  <text start="274.139" dur="3.801">of being familiar with the Lord he just</text>
  <text start="276.45" dur="4.439">said don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t go to that place</text>
  <text start="277.94" dur="5.68">challenge your walk with God okay so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="280.889" dur="6.721">gonna talk to you about this now listen</text>
  <text start="283.62" dur="6.269">when God comes alright when his presence</text>
  <text start="287.61" dur="5.01">comes we always see him in what I would</text>
  <text start="289.889" dur="4.5">call a one dimension we see him in the</text>
  <text start="292.62" dur="3.21">area of our gifting we see him in the</text>
  <text start="294.389" dur="6.241">area strengths that&amp;#39;s where he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="295.83" dur="6.21">developed his presence right but we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="300.63" dur="7.2">missing something that God wants us to</text>
  <text start="302.04" dur="9.39">get willing to express the kingdom in</text>
  <text start="307.83" dur="5.16">its fullness all right so that means</text>
  <text start="311.43" dur="3.209">that God is willing to talk to people</text>
  <text start="312.99" dur="2.94">now here are the categories God is</text>
  <text start="314.639" dur="4.081">willing to talk to people about their</text>
  <text start="315.93" dur="5.01">business through us God is willing to</text>
  <text start="318.72" dur="3.96">talk to him about their family God is</text>
  <text start="320.94" dur="3.21">willing to talk to him about a blessing</text>
  <text start="322.68" dur="2.82">that he wants to bring into their life</text>
  <text start="324.15" dur="4.05">and God is willing to talk to him about</text>
  <text start="325.5" dur="5.7">their future God is willing to talk to</text>
  <text start="328.2" dur="5.88">him about a pain in their past like he</text>
  <text start="331.2" dur="5.61">comes and he does his ministry through</text>
  <text start="334.08" dur="6.32">us we&amp;#39;re not to limit him by saying I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="336.81" dur="6.75">only gonna focus in one arena okay</text>
  <text start="340.4" dur="5.23">remember this when God&amp;#39;s presence comes</text>
  <text start="343.56" dur="4.5">he wants you to stay with him long</text>
  <text start="345.63" dur="4.74">enough so he can do all of what he wants</text>
  <text start="348.06" dur="3.81">to do in that person&amp;#39;s life when I first</text>
  <text start="350.37" dur="3.18">started prompt signed people I always</text>
  <text start="351.87" dur="3.06">thought well the main goal here is just</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="3.929">to give them what their gift is and then</text>
  <text start="354.93" dur="3.66">move on to the next person and but I</text>
  <text start="357.479" dur="2.581">don&amp;#39;t know if you guys never done this</text>
  <text start="358.59" dur="2.97">when you do that you still sense the</text>
  <text start="360.06" dur="4.169">presence of the Lord he is trying to</text>
  <text start="361.56" dur="6.419">indicate something there if sense is</text>
  <text start="364.229" dur="5.971">still you are to wait and see as other</text>
  <text start="367.979" dur="3.961">information about another arena of</text>
  <text start="370.2" dur="4.529">someone&amp;#39;s life you&amp;#39;re supposed to</text>
  <text start="371.94" dur="4.14">actually move towards him and go alright</text>
  <text start="374.729" dur="3.361">now is there anything you want to tell</text>
  <text start="376.08" dur="3.33">me about business is there anything you</text>
  <text start="378.09" dur="2.4">want to talk to me about their family</text>
  <text start="379.41" dur="5.1">let me let me give you an illustration</text>
  <text start="380.49" dur="5.22">of this so we&amp;#39;re down in Guatemala Jim</text>
  <text start="384.51" dur="2.73">has been come up and he wants me to</text>
  <text start="385.71" dur="3.959">minister to people and I&amp;#39;m looking over</text>
  <text start="387.24" dur="4.739">the audience and I see a woman kind of</text>
  <text start="389.669" dur="7.141">towards the back and I get a picture of</text>
  <text start="391.979" dur="9.3">her and and I&amp;#39;m asking a Lord Lord could</text>
  <text start="396.81" dur="6.539">you show me something besides gifting</text>
  <text start="401.279" dur="3.72">so here&amp;#39;s what the Lord does he shows me</text>
  <text start="403.349" dur="3.27">this woman that&amp;#39;s in the audience and</text>
  <text start="404.999" dur="4.23">then he gives me a picture of a young</text>
  <text start="406.619" dur="4.02">girl standing next door so whenever God</text>
  <text start="409.229" dur="2.94">gives you something and you do not</text>
  <text start="410.639" dur="3.99">understand what it is it is an</text>
  <text start="412.169" dur="4.86">invitation to dialogue okay what is that</text>
  <text start="414.629" dur="4.74">God he tells me this is her daughter</text>
  <text start="417.029" dur="4.38">okay then he gives me another picture in</text>
  <text start="419.369" dur="4.95">my mind where they&amp;#39;re yelling back and</text>
  <text start="421.409" dur="4.95">forth out each other okay now I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="424.319" dur="4.38">know if you guys were like this but the</text>
  <text start="426.359" dur="4.41">hardest bridge that I&amp;#39;ve had to cross in</text>
  <text start="428.699" dur="3.96">the arena of Revelation is assuming I</text>
  <text start="430.769" dur="3.96">know what God is saying without asking</text>
  <text start="432.659" dur="4.59">him all right</text>
  <text start="434.729" dur="5.16">and so I see this conflict and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="437.249" dur="5.19">asking the Lord okay I see that but what</text>
  <text start="439.889" dur="4.77">are you wanting to say from that and the</text>
  <text start="442.439" dur="4.38">Lord told me this mother and daughter</text>
  <text start="444.659" dur="4.83">are in conflict with each other all the</text>
  <text start="446.819" dur="3.06">time and then he said the issue is be</text>
  <text start="449.489" dur="2.55">ready</text>
  <text start="449.879" dur="3.54">gifting isn&amp;#39;t that nice s Oh Lord don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="452.039" dur="3.54">talk to me about and he ended up going</text>
  <text start="453.419" dur="4.17">back to that he said the mother and the</text>
  <text start="455.579" dur="5.04">daughter have similar calls the mother</text>
  <text start="457.589" dur="4.2">doesn&amp;#39;t like her frailties that she sees</text>
  <text start="460.619" dur="3.69">in her daughter so they&amp;#39;re in conflict</text>
  <text start="461.789" dur="5.071">with each other all the time okay now a</text>
  <text start="464.309" dur="4.02">lot of our way that we speak in our</text>
  <text start="466.86" dur="5.039">culture doesn&amp;#39;t translate into other</text>
  <text start="468.329" dur="5.46">cultures and so I just said all right so</text>
  <text start="471.899" dur="4.711">I assumed okay I&amp;#39;m gonna do the ministry</text>
  <text start="473.789" dur="5.16">now okay so I had this lady stand up and</text>
  <text start="476.61" dur="4.949">I said um ma&amp;#39;am do you have a daughter</text>
  <text start="478.949" dur="6.63">and she&amp;#39;s yes and she got really excited</text>
  <text start="481.559" dur="4.38">about that and I said hearing your</text>
  <text start="485.579" dur="2.55">daughter</text>
  <text start="485.939" dur="4.89">drive each other up the wall don&amp;#39;t you</text>
  <text start="488.129" dur="4.02">and the translator looked at me what</text>
  <text start="490.829" dur="3.031">does it mean to drive someone up the</text>
  <text start="492.149" dur="5.85">wall and I thought oh that didn&amp;#39;t work</text>
  <text start="493.86" dur="5.639">and so I said the idea is they get on</text>
  <text start="497.999" dur="3.66">each other&amp;#39;s nerves they&amp;#39;re in conflict</text>
  <text start="499.499" dur="3.48">and and she got real excited that the</text>
  <text start="501.659" dur="2.94">Lord actually pointed that out in front</text>
  <text start="502.979" dur="3.45">of everybody she starts weeping and</text>
  <text start="504.599" dur="3.15">crying about that and I said this is</text>
  <text start="506.429" dur="2.97">really interesting God wants you to know</text>
  <text start="507.749" dur="4.02">that your daughter has the similar call</text>
  <text start="509.399" dur="4.86">that you do and because of the weakness</text>
  <text start="511.769" dur="4.17">that you see in yourself you translate</text>
  <text start="514.259" dur="3.96">that into how you see your daughter and</text>
  <text start="515.939" dur="4.861">that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re in conflict with and</text>
  <text start="518.219" dur="5.07">then the power of the Lord came over her</text>
  <text start="520.8" dur="5.67">and started healing her right there now</text>
