  <text start="153.75" dur="4.11">number was one hundred ninety thousand</text>
  <text start="155.099" dur="6.661">so they beat the projected number by</text>

  <text start="195.78" dur="4.319">terms in the house don&amp;#39;t quote me on</text>
  <text start="198.45" dur="2.759">that but I think this is a sixth time I</text>
  <text start="200.099" dur="4.621">think he&amp;#39;s been in house for 12 years</text>
  <text start="201.209" dur="6.661">look trey gowdy is really a prosecutor</text>
  <text start="204.72" dur="6.449">he he said he&amp;#39;s not really enjoying</text>
  <text start="207.87" dur="4.949">being a congressman right now it&amp;#39;s not</text>
  <text start="211.169" dur="4.021">challenging him he wants to go back to</text>
  <text start="212.819" dur="10.2">practicing law and probably being a</text>
  <text start="215.19" dur="9.919">prosecutor so so that may be exactly</text>
  <text start="223.019" dur="5.28">what is happening with trey gowdy</text>
  <text start="225.109" dur="7.331">i have said some things about trey gowdy</text>
  <text start="228.299" dur="9.241">in the past i have not been terribly</text>
  <text start="232.44" dur="7.169">impressed with Trey&amp;#39;s handling of the</text>
  <text start="237.54" dur="4.919">Benghazi investigation and some other</text>
  <text start="239.609" dur="4.59">investigations he and jason Chaffetz</text>
  <text start="242.459" dur="3.801">were on House Oversight Committee and</text>
  <text start="244.199" dur="6.991">they were in charge of the Benghazi</text>
  <text start="246.26" dur="6.759">committee and there there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="251.19" dur="4.439">people who are angry about the way that</text>
  <text start="253.019" dur="6.301">whole thing was handled and some people</text>
  <text start="255.629" dur="6.931">love trey Gowdy because he has a lot of</text>
  <text start="259.32" dur="5.19">bark and he is passionate but some</text>
  <text start="262.56" dur="5.52">people don&amp;#39;t like trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="264.51" dur="7.99">because he never seems to polish</text>
  <text start="268.08" dur="7.27">and and I would just I&amp;#39;m gonna offer</text>
  <text start="272.5" dur="8.31">some observations for you to think about</text>
  <text start="275.35" dur="8.81">and pray about for the last 20 years 20</text>
  <text start="280.81" dur="7.91">probably 30 years and maybe longer</text>
  <text start="284.16" dur="9.22">Congress and the government has been</text>
  <text start="288.72" dur="12.12">under the control of people with a lot</text>
  <text start="293.38" dur="11.43">of money and an evil agenda and the</text>
  <text start="300.84" dur="6.7">puppet masters who hold the strings to</text>
  <text start="304.81" dur="6.24">the people in Washington they have</text>
  <text start="307.54" dur="5.88">prevented the Benghazi committee from</text>
  <text start="311.05" dur="4.77">coming to a fair conclusion the same</text>
  <text start="313.42" dur="4.23">people who prevented the Hillary email</text>
  <text start="315.82" dur="4.35">investigation from coming to a fair</text>
  <text start="317.65" dur="6.95">conclusion all of these committees all</text>
  <text start="320.17" dur="6.99">these investigations have all been</text>
  <text start="324.6" dur="4.15">manipulated the outcomes manipulated and</text>
  <text start="327.16" dur="5.91">that people involved in the</text>
  <text start="328.75" dur="7.38">investigations are not allowed to come</text>
  <text start="333.07" dur="5.49">to the right conclusions and the right</text>
  <text start="336.13" dur="8.39">recommendations because of powerful</text>
  <text start="338.56" dur="8.91">people who wanted a certain outcome so</text>
  <text start="344.52" dur="6.4">when I look at what happened in the</text>
  <text start="347.47" dur="4.95">Benghazi committee look it&amp;#39;s just like</text>
  <text start="350.92" dur="3.39">they help the Clinton email</text>
  <text start="352.42" dur="4.17">investigation the outcome of that was</text>
  <text start="354.31" dur="3.56">already known at the beginning and they</text>
  <text start="356.59" dur="3.27">were just going through the process</text>
  <text start="357.87" dur="3.82">there was a lot of intense questioning</text>
  <text start="359.86" dur="3.93">there was a lot of hearings that were</text>
  <text start="361.69" dur="5.49">emotional it was all this theater and</text>
  <text start="363.79" dur="7.95">then nothing ever happened and and I</text>
  <text start="367.18" dur="5.76">would say this it could be that trey</text>
  <text start="371.74" dur="3.6">Gowdy is going to go back to South</text>
  <text start="372.94" dur="4.47">Carolina and practice law or they may</text>
  <text start="375.34" dur="6.21">you know work for some prosecutor&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="377.41" dur="7.41">office it&amp;#39;s possible it&amp;#39;s also possible</text>
  <text start="381.55" dur="5.61">that trey Gowdy has seen something in</text>
  <text start="384.82" dur="4.95">Trump and he has seen the way Trump has</text>
  <text start="387.16" dur="8.21">taken on the deep state and the puppet</text>
  <text start="389.77" dur="5.6">masters and it could be that trey is</text>
  <text start="395.669" dur="4.931">looking for a position within the</text>
  <text start="398.59" dur="6.65">Department of Justice or the FBI</text>
  <text start="400.6" dur="12.09">could be now I&amp;#39;m going to read to you a</text>

  <text start="422.26" dur="3.84">people have not been wanting to trust</text>
  <text start="423.76" dur="3.78">jeff sessions because they look at</text>
  <text start="426.1" dur="2.73">what&amp;#39;s going on or what&amp;#39;s not going on</text>
  <text start="427.54" dur="6.63">and think how a sessions isn&amp;#39;t doing</text>

  <text start="434.17" dur="7.53">departure h ec in brackets Trey Gowdy&amp;#39;s</text>

  <text start="445.33" dur="3">he was stepping down from the House</text>
  <text start="446.62" dur="3.56">Ethics Committee and people were</text>
  <text start="448.33" dur="3.96">wondering why he was stepping down and</text>
  <text start="450.18" dur="3.25">they were like oh he&amp;#39;s got to step down</text>
  <text start="452.29" dur="5.31">because he has to testify about</text>
  <text start="453.43" dur="5.52">something this was when all there were a</text>
  <text start="457.6" dur="3.06">lot of people that wake who were and</text>
  <text start="458.95" dur="3.93">then the weeks previously who were</text>
  <text start="460.66" dur="4.32">stepping down and announcing they were</text>
  <text start="462.88" dur="6.53">not going to run again for Congress</text>
  <text start="464.98" dur="7.14">because of sexual misconduct allegations</text>
  <text start="469.41" dur="4.06">so people were wondering if Trey was</text>
  <text start="472.12" dur="5.85">stepping down from the ethics committee</text>
  <text start="473.47" dur="8.25">because he had to testify and Q said no</text>
  <text start="477.97" dur="5.22">not to testify he&amp;#39;s not he doesn&amp;#39;t need</text>
  <text start="481.72" dur="4.79">to step down from the ethics committee</text>
  <text start="483.19" dur="8.1">if he needs to testify think logically</text>

  <text start="499.12" dur="6.51">walking into now this is two weeks ago</text>
  <text start="502.14" dur="8.86">sure that Q is asking is what role might</text>
  <text start="505.63" dur="6.78">trey gowdy be walking into so two weeks</text>
  <text start="511" dur="2.969">later we think okay he&amp;#39;s stepping on</text>

  <text start="517.27" dur="8.13">altogether what role would trey gowdy be</text>
  <text start="522.789" dur="4.921">stepping into now I was sitting there</text>
  <text start="525.4" dur="5.36">this afternoon thinking about this and I</text>
  <text start="527.71" dur="6.03">thought okay well one of them roles is</text>
  <text start="530.76" dur="3.82">Andrew McCabe is stepping down as deputy</text>
  <text start="533.74" dur="4.89">FBI direct</text>
  <text start="534.58" dur="6.78">so maybe gaudi is looking for the deputy</text>
  <text start="538.63" dur="5.46">FBI director and then I thought no I</text>
  <text start="541.36" dur="4.86">don&amp;#39;t think so because they talked about</text>
  <text start="544.09" dur="4.02">him becoming the FBI director before</text>
  <text start="546.22" dur="5.43">Chris Rea was appointed and Gowdy said</text>
  <text start="548.11" dur="5.03">I&amp;#39;m not interested and see Gowdy is not</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="4.35">a cop</text>
  <text start="553.14" dur="5.32">that&amp;#39;s an FBI FBI does investigations</text>
  <text start="556" dur="4.92">there at their law enforcement Gowdy is</text>
  <text start="558.46" dur="5.06">a prosecutor he would be much better</text>
  <text start="560.92" dur="9.99">suited in the Department of Justice okay</text>
  <text start="563.52" dur="9.43">now that&amp;#39;s gonna say this so q in some</text>
  <text start="570.91" dur="3.75">Litton recent posts has suggested it</text>
  <text start="572.95" dur="5.3">Rosenstein is gonna be fired when the</text>
  <text start="574.66" dur="5.91">memo comes out which may be tomorrow</text>
  <text start="578.25" dur="5.29">that memo may come out tomorrow or</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="4.62">Friday when the memo comes out people</text>
  <text start="583.54" dur="2.73">have been speculating it Rosenstein is</text>
  <text start="585.19" dur="2.64">going to be fired because there are</text>
  <text start="586.27" dur="4.35">things in the memo that are going to</text>
  <text start="587.83" dur="8.81">implicate him so I&amp;#39;m just going to play</text>
  <text start="590.62" dur="8.79">devil&amp;#39;s advocate what if what if</text>
  <text start="596.64" dur="5.53">Rosenstein is implicated in the memo</text>
  <text start="599.41" dur="5.1">they know about it they know Rosenstein</text>
  <text start="602.17" dur="4.89">is going to be leaving and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="604.51" dur="6.12">recruiting Trey Gaudi to be the Deputy</text>
  <text start="607.06" dur="7.11">Attorney General under Jeff Sessions is</text>
  <text start="610.63" dur="5.07">that a possibility because in his</text>
  <text start="614.17" dur="3.33">statement where he said I&amp;#39;m gonna go</text>
  <text start="615.7" dur="5.85">practice I want to go back to the</text>
  <text start="617.5" dur="6.62">Justice end of you know my career so he</text>
  <text start="621.55" dur="5.61">wants to get back into litigation and</text>
  <text start="624.12" dur="3.76">trials and prosecution that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s his</text>
  <text start="627.16" dur="3.39">comfort zone</text>
  <text start="627.88" dur="4.8">look he&amp;#39;s spent his time in Congress and</text>
  <text start="630.55" dur="5.16">I think he realizes he can&amp;#39;t do much</text>
  <text start="632.68" dur="5.31">look the House Oversight Committee they</text>
  <text start="635.71" dur="3.99">can investigate and they can have</text>
  <text start="637.99" dur="4.14">hearings but they don&amp;#39;t have the ability</text>
  <text start="639.7" dur="5.91">to prosecute they cannot bring people to</text>
  <text start="642.13" dur="5.31">justice they have to refer someone to</text>
  <text start="645.61" dur="3.3">the DOJ and if the DOJ or the FBI</text>
  <text start="647.44" dur="3.69">doesn&amp;#39;t want to prosecute them nothing</text>
  <text start="648.91" dur="7.71">is gonna happen in Congress you are</text>
  <text start="651.13" dur="6.84">relatively powerless to do any real work</text>
  <text start="656.62" dur="3.3">that makes a difference as far as law</text>
  <text start="657.97" dur="4.59">enforcement goes they have these</text>
  <text start="659.92" dur="7.83">investigations but they never really end</text>
  <text start="662.56" dur="9.09">up doing a whole lot so what if Gowdy</text>
  <text start="667.75" dur="6.75">realize okay I&amp;#39;m done with I&amp;#39;m done with</text>
  <text start="671.65" dur="6.96">Congress I&amp;#39;m gonna go back into being a</text>
  <text start="674.5" dur="6.36">prosecutor and what if they were they</text>
  <text start="678.61" dur="4.97">knew ahead of time Rosen Stein was nice</text>
  <text start="680.86" dur="6.42">that was gonna be leaving and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="683.58" dur="7.03">looking at trey Gowdy to be the Deputy</text>
  <text start="687.28" dur="4.32">Attorney General now I other people have</text>
  <text start="690.61" dur="3.6">said well what if he&amp;#39;s gonna be a</text>
  <text start="691.6" dur="6.99">special counsel now there is going to be</text>
  <text start="694.21" dur="6.03">a second special counsel we know that if</text>
  <text start="698.59" dur="4.89">you&amp;#39;ve been following what the House</text>
  <text start="700.24" dur="4.77">Judiciary the Senate Judiciary and the</text>
  <text start="703.48" dur="2.22">House Intelligence Committee have been</text>
  <text start="705.01" dur="3.09">doing</text>
  <text start="705.7" dur="5.16">they have already called for a special</text>
  <text start="708.1" dur="5.1">counsel and what is that second special</text>
  <text start="710.86" dur="4.44">counsel going to do the second special</text>
  <text start="713.2" dur="4.44">counsel is going to investigate the</text>
  <text start="715.3" dur="4.59">Department of Justice and the FBI</text>
  <text start="717.64" dur="3.96">you cannot and people have asked me you</text>
  <text start="719.89" dur="4.74">know why would you have another second</text>
  <text start="721.6" dur="4.62">count a second special counsel the</text>
  <text start="724.63" dur="5.16">Department of Justice can&amp;#39;t investigate</text>
  <text start="726.22" dur="5.85">itself FBI can&amp;#39;t investigate itself it</text>
  <text start="729.79" dur="4.08">has to be a neutral person from outside</text>
  <text start="732.07" dur="4.2">their apartment that comes in and</text>
  <text start="733.87" dur="4.2">investigates I don&amp;#39;t think trey Gowdy</text>
  <text start="736.27" dur="4.95">would be adequately suited for that I</text>

  <text start="1087.62" dur="3.689">put our person in the White House that</text>
  <text start="1089.45" dur="3.81">was the plan from the beginning that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1091.309" dur="3.691">the purpose for the Muller investigation</text>
  <text start="1093.26" dur="3.72">and you&amp;#39;re gonna find that out when that</text>
  <text start="1095" dur="4.049">memo when the memo comes out you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1096.98" dur="3.48">going to find out they have evidence</text>
  <text start="1099.049" dur="5.041">that that was the plan from the very</text>
  <text start="1100.46" dur="7.469">beginning the whole thing was a pretext</text>
  <text start="1104.09" dur="8.01">that they had set up months ago years</text>
  <text start="1107.929" dur="10.081">ago I should say so I would I would say</text>
  <text start="1112.1" dur="10.74">this about the thing with Rosenstein is</text>
  <text start="1118.01" dur="8.039">I believe Rosenstein has been used</text>
  <text start="1122.84" dur="5.4">strategically by sessions and Trump</text>
  <text start="1126.049" dur="3.931">because the deep state didn&amp;#39;t Trump</text>
  <text start="1128.24" dur="4.08">trust Trump and they didn&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="1129.98" dur="4.89">sessions so they figured they had to put</text>
  <text start="1132.32" dur="5.91">somebody in there who who would be over</text>
  <text start="1134.87" dur="6.15">the investigation that would be friendly</text>
  <text start="1138.23" dur="5.28">to the deep state and that was Rosen</text>
  <text start="1141.02" dur="4.98">Stein and now the Rosenstein has served</text>
  <text start="1143.51" dur="4.98">his purpose if they need to get rid of</text>
  <text start="1146" dur="6.72">him they can get rid of him and put in</text>
  <text start="1148.49" dur="8.689">somebody else who they trust so I think</text>
  <text start="1152.72" dur="9.39">that&amp;#39;s why I think q has been asking why</text>
  <text start="1157.179" dur="9.311">who do we trust and what role is trey</text>

  <text start="1285.029" dur="11.821">happening in the Muller investigation</text>
  <text start="1287.009" dur="12.601">and one of them is the fact that there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1296.85" dur="6.12">so much to talk about all right so let</text>
  <text start="1299.61" dur="4.769">me break it down this way the Inspector</text>
  <text start="1302.97" dur="3.6">General the Department of Justice</text>
  <text start="1304.379" dur="4.14">Inspector General Mike Horowitz he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1306.57" dur="3.41">been doing a very long investigation on</text>
  <text start="1308.519" dur="4.02">the Department of Justice and the FBI</text>
  <text start="1309.98" dur="6.87">one of the things that Horowitz has</text>
  <text start="1312.539" dur="7.831">found out is that FBI agents have been</text>
  <text start="1316.85" dur="7.36">falsifying information in their witness</text>
  <text start="1320.37" dur="7.29">testimony reports so the FBI takes</text>
  <text start="1324.21" dur="5.49">a report on a witness interrogation or</text>
  <text start="1327.66" dur="6.48">testimony they put it in what&amp;#39;s called a</text>
  <text start="1329.7" dur="8.37">302 and a 302 they don&amp;#39;t record the</text>
  <text start="1334.14" dur="7.23">interviews the agents give a summary of</text>
  <text start="1338.07" dur="7.98">the interview and their findings in a</text>
  <text start="1341.37" dur="7.29">302 document and Horowitz has found out</text>
  <text start="1346.05" dur="7.02">that the FBI has been falsifying</text>
  <text start="1348.66" dur="10.44">information in the 302s there is a</text>
  <text start="1353.07" dur="10.23">report out by true pundit that Andrew</text>
  <text start="1359.1" dur="6.93">McCabe has been for a long time has been</text>
  <text start="1363.3" dur="8.7">falsifying 302s and asking other FBI</text>
  <text start="1366.03" dur="10.13">agents to falsify their 302s if the FBI</text>
  <text start="1372" dur="7.74">is has been is found guilty of</text>
  <text start="1376.16" dur="6.13">falsifying their 302 reports what that</text>
  <text start="1379.74" dur="5.01">means is the agents when they go to</text>
  <text start="1382.29" dur="5.13">court they they give testimony from a</text>
  <text start="1384.75" dur="5.45">judge and their testimony is generally</text>
  <text start="1387.42" dur="6.63">accepted without question by the judge</text>
  <text start="1390.2" dur="6.73">they can convict people who are innocent</text>
  <text start="1394.05" dur="7.01">if the FBI agent lies in their 302</text>
  <text start="1396.93" dur="9.42">report do you see where this is going</text>
  <text start="1401.06" dur="7.84">if the Inspector General tells America</text>
  <text start="1406.35" dur="6.09">your FBI agents have been lying about</text>
  <text start="1408.9" dur="6.36">their their reports of what witnesses</text>
  <text start="1412.44" dur="5.01">have told them you&amp;#39;re gonna have a whole</text>
  <text start="1415.26" dur="6.54">lot of attorneys lined up waiting to</text>
  <text start="1417.45" dur="7.35">appeal they&amp;#39;re the decisions of the</text>
  <text start="1421.8" dur="7.35">cases because they&amp;#39;re gonna say hey you</text>
  <text start="1424.8" dur="6.75">know my defendant my client was innocent</text>
  <text start="1429.15" dur="5.7">and this FBI agent lied and I want to</text>
  <text start="1431.55" dur="4.67">have this case retried a number of</text>
  <text start="1434.85" dur="5.52">people are coming to this very</text>
  <text start="1436.22" dur="6.19">uncomfortable conclusion that if this</text>

  <text start="1510.9" dur="6.1">because here&amp;#39;s my here&amp;#39;s my theory and</text>
  <text start="1515.23" dur="4.59">this is Sundance says this is where</text>
  <text start="1517" dur="6.81">Sundance is going with this Peter struck</text>

  <text start="1526.12" dur="5.28">interviewed Hillary and Cheryl Mills and</text>
  <text start="1529.72" dur="5.25">a lot of other people in event in the</text>

  <text start="1540.31" dur="4.25">the guys in the small group that has</text>
  <text start="1542.14" dur="8.31">been setting up this Trump investigation</text>
  <text start="1544.56" dur="9.94">so what if Muller found out that Peter</text>
  <text start="1550.45" dur="9.51">Strock lied in his 302s about what Flynn</text>
  <text start="1554.5" dur="8.69">said if Strock lied in his 302s and</text>
  <text start="1559.96" dur="7.35">Muller takes a guilty plea from Flynn on</text>
  <text start="1563.19" dur="8.68">for on falsified 302s he looks like an</text>
  <text start="1567.31" dur="7.86">absolute idiot so they&amp;#39;re asking for a</text>
  <text start="1571.87" dur="4.98">delay of sentencing and I think that</text>
  <text start="1575.17" dur="3.03">Flynn will actually not be sentenced</text>
  <text start="1576.85" dur="3.45">though probably gonna have to drop</text>
  <text start="1578.2" dur="5.19">charges against him because this whole</text>
  <text start="1580.3" dur="5.58">corruption thing in the FBI is blowing</text>
  <text start="1583.39" dur="4.2">up and Flynn is probably gonna be one of</text>
  <text start="1585.88" dur="3.95">the first people who will have his case</text>
  <text start="1587.59" dur="7.01">the whole case thrown out because</text>

  <text start="1594.6" dur="4.89">in the FBI I believe that&amp;#39;s probably</text>
  <text start="1598.26" dur="3.72">where this is going to go</text>
  <text start="1599.49" dur="4.62">I believe Flynn will probably end up</text>
  <text start="1601.98" dur="6.329">walking away from this and Trump won&amp;#39;t</text>

  <text start="1618.51" dur="5.039">documents I think Sundance has a legal</text>

  <text start="1623.549" dur="4.291">the stuff and analyze it really well</text>
  <text start="1625.08" dur="5.189">Sundance has been spot on on all of the</text>

  <text start="1638.46" dur="5.939">to say this was having a conversation</text>
  <text start="1641.25" dur="5.639">and with Sundance on Twitter redirect</text>
  <text start="1644.399" dur="8.24">messaging and Sundance was pretty pissed</text>
  <text start="1646.889" dur="8.9">off because he saw this this FISA</text>
  <text start="1652.639" dur="5.561">scandal pointing in the direction of</text>
  <text start="1655.789" dur="5.86">agents in the FBI in the Department of</text>
  <text start="1658.2" dur="5.16">Justice illegally accessing this</text>
  <text start="1661.649" dur="6.02">database and then allowing private</text>
  <text start="1663.36" dur="7.5">contractors to do it and at that time</text>
  <text start="1667.669" dur="5.431">even the people on Fox News were taking</text>
  <text start="1670.86" dur="4.64">it in the direction of Russia and</text>
  <text start="1673.1" dur="4.809">Sundance was getting angry he was</text>
  <text start="1675.5" dur="5.26">tagging all these news reporters Sara</text>
  <text start="1677.909" dur="5.13">Carter John Solomon everybody to try to</text>
  <text start="1680.76" dur="3.539">get their focus on hey this is going</text>
  <text start="1683.039" dur="3.661">toward the Department of Justice in the</text>
  <text start="1684.299" dur="3.811">FBI these guys are guilty go in that</text>
  <text start="1686.7" dur="2.4">direction and none of them would do it</text>
  <text start="1688.11" dur="3.029">they were all going in the opposite</text>
  <text start="1689.1" dur="5.939">direction so Sundance got kind of angry</text>
  <text start="1691.139" dur="7.471">about it and I&amp;#39;m and I tucked I messaged</text>
  <text start="1695.039" dur="5.88">him and I said you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1698.61" dur="3.659">wasting your time the people in the</text>
  <text start="1700.919" dur="4.201">mainstream media don&amp;#39;t care about this</text>
  <text start="1702.269" dur="5.731">they do not want any part of this they</text>
  <text start="1705.12" dur="4.289">are in a war against Trump and I told</text>
  <text start="1708" dur="4.529">him at this dream that I had where I saw</text>
  <text start="1709.409" dur="4.65">this war against the the Trump had with</text>
  <text start="1712.529" dur="4.291">the media and the media was trying to</text>
  <text start="1714.059" dur="4.561">destroy Trump and Trump was fighting</text>
  <text start="1716.82" dur="4.77">against the media this is about a year</text>
  <text start="1718.62" dur="4.95">ago and I said look Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="1721.59" dur="3.99">either the media is going to</text>
  <text start="1723.57" dur="4.41">destroy Trump or Trump is going to</text>
  <text start="1725.58" dur="5.07">destroy the mainstream media and I said</text>
  <text start="1727.98" dur="7.98">after that dream had another dream where</text>
  <text start="1730.65" dur="7.65">I saw a new system of news reporters it</text>
  <text start="1735.96" dur="4.95">was average people like me and you and</text>
  <text start="1738.3" dur="6.3">other and our friends and we were giving</text>
  <text start="1740.91" dur="6.14">people lose without spin without an</text>
  <text start="1744.6" dur="4.95">agenda with just reporting what we see</text>
  <text start="1747.05" dur="5.41">reporting what we&amp;#39;re learning and I said</text>
  <text start="1749.55" dur="4.62">this you&amp;#39;re part of the new media don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1752.46" dur="4.76">expect those reporters to take any</text>
  <text start="1754.17" dur="7.14">interest in this and ever since then</text>
  <text start="1757.22" dur="6.61">Sundance has started putting new stories</text>
  <text start="1761.31" dur="4.11">on his website not just political stuff</text>
  <text start="1763.83" dur="3.09">but there&amp;#39;s all kinds of other news</text>
  <text start="1765.42" dur="3.9">stories on there Sundance is becoming</text>
  <text start="1766.92" dur="4.62">like a like a regular reporter now where</text>
  <text start="1769.32" dur="3.57">it&amp;#39;ll just take news stories of</text>
  <text start="1771.54" dur="3.51">different things and put it on there and</text>
  <text start="1772.89" dur="5.79">it&amp;#39;s not just conservative political</text>
  <text start="1775.05" dur="4.86">commentary anymore so I am happy to see</text>
  <text start="1778.68" dur="5.34">Sundance going in that direction I think</text>
  <text start="1779.91" dur="6.83">it&amp;#39;s cool I go there now for more news</text>
  <text start="1784.02" dur="7.02">and instead of giving you know links to</text>
  <text start="1786.74" dur="5.94">MSNBC or CNN if Sundance has that story</text>
  <text start="1791.04" dur="7.07">on his website I&amp;#39;ll share that link</text>
  <text start="1792.68" dur="8.14">because I want to support people who are</text>
  <text start="1798.11" dur="7">independent and and you know doing their</text>
  <text start="1800.82" dur="5.85">own thing so yeah it&amp;#39;s looking maybe</text>
  <text start="1805.11" dur="7.64">like Flynn was is actually gonna walk</text>
  <text start="1806.67" dur="6.08">how about that all right</text>
  <text start="1812.99" dur="7.21">and one more thing I want to talk about</text>
  <text start="1815.79" dur="7.56">before I go and that is this whole thing</text>
  <text start="1820.2" dur="8.13">with Debbie Nunez and the memo and the</text>

  <text start="2717.96" dur="6.21">particularly if they work in government</text>
  <text start="2720.57" dur="6.4">so what happens if the FBI director or</text>

  <text start="2726.97" dur="8.43">director betray their oath of office and</text>
  <text start="2730.87" dur="8.37">plot to assassinate the president what</text>

  <text start="2753.16" dur="3.81">be put under a military trial is if</text>
  <text start="2755.53" dur="3.57">they&amp;#39;re going to be tried for treason</text>
  <text start="2756.97" dur="4.5">because it&amp;#39;s the same as if you&amp;#39;re an</text>
  <text start="2759.1" dur="9.95">enemy combatant or person in the</text>
  <text start="2761.47" dur="10.56">military or a government official right</text>
