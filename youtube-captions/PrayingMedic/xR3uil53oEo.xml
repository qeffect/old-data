  <text start="1826.61" dur="3.66">times on two different podcast that you</text>

  <text start="1851.179" dur="7.711">a lot of people out but it shouldn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="1856.21" dur="6.219">believe it&amp;#39;s actually something that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1858.89" dur="6.45">very normal but it&amp;#39;s something that we</text>
  <text start="1862.429" dur="4.981">are not very aware of for a number of</text>
  <text start="1865.34" dur="6.48">reasons which I can get into here in a</text>
  <text start="1867.41" dur="6.45">minute in my conversations with my huge</text>
  <text start="1871.82" dur="4.229">group of friends on Facebook I have</text>
  <text start="1873.86" dur="4.65">found that a lot of people are having</text>
  <text start="1876.049" dur="5.491">experiences where they are traveling in</text>
  <text start="1878.51" dur="4.71">the spirit and so we as a group have</text>
  <text start="1881.54" dur="4.2">been trying to understand what God is</text>
  <text start="1883.22" dur="4.32">doing with this when I speak of</text>
  <text start="1885.74" dur="3">traveling the spirit I&amp;#39;m speaking mainly</text>
  <text start="1887.54" dur="3.39">of two different things</text>
  <text start="1888.74" dur="5.25">and the community of people that I hang</text>
  <text start="1890.93" dur="6.96">out with we use two different terms one</text>
  <text start="1893.99" dur="6.42">of which is translocation okay and with</text>
  <text start="1897.89" dur="6.54">that location of your physical body is</text>
  <text start="1900.41" dur="6.72">the key thing in translocation your</text>
  <text start="1904.43" dur="4.86">physical body is picked up and moved to</text>
  <text start="1907.13" dur="4.02">a different location other than where</text>
  <text start="1909.29" dur="3.9">you are right now supernaturally by the</text>
  <text start="1911.15" dur="3.78">power of God so this is actually what</text>
  <text start="1913.19" dur="4.08">happened to Philip in the book of Acts</text>
  <text start="1914.93" dur="4.11">in chapter 8 yeah when he was hanging</text>
  <text start="1917.27" dur="4.86">out with the Ethiopian eunuch he</text>
  <text start="1919.04" dur="4.47">baptized him in the ditch and when they</text>
  <text start="1922.13" dur="4.29">came up out of the water Philip was</text>
  <text start="1923.51" dur="4.71">picked up and taken to I think as ODIs</text>
  <text start="1926.42" dur="3.24">and there was a revival going on there</text>
  <text start="1928.22" dur="2.73">and he hung out there so the Lord</text>
  <text start="1929.66" dur="1.89">physically picked him up and took him</text>
  <text start="1930.95" dur="2.1">somewhere else</text>
  <text start="1931.55" dur="4.89">most of us refer to that as</text>
  <text start="1933.05" dur="5.82">translocation I do know of a number of</text>
  <text start="1936.44" dur="6.9">people who have experienced this Wow in</text>
  <text start="1938.87" dur="7.74">fact I had a prayer request from a</text>
  <text start="1943.34" dur="6.33">fellow who had a dislocated thumb okay</text>
  <text start="1946.61" dur="5.67">that happened when he was asleep when he</text>
  <text start="1949.67" dur="5.37">we had a travelling experience where he</text>
  <text start="1952.28" dur="4.38">ended up in China and there was an</text>

  <text start="1964.55" dur="4.62">the bathroom and and it was it had been</text>
  <text start="1966.77" dur="5.13">in pain for five or six weeks the reason</text>

  <text start="1980.12" dur="3.66">around him they were all speaking</text>
  <text start="1981.53" dur="3.66">Chinese although the Holy Spirit</text>
  <text start="1983.78" dur="2.46">translated what they were saying so he</text>
  <text start="1985.19" dur="2.52">could understand what they&amp;#39;re saying</text>
  <text start="1986.24" dur="4.56">yeah even though they were speaking</text>
  <text start="1987.71" dur="4.95">Chinese Wow he was working on this head</text>

  <text start="1997.7" dur="3.9">machine they were feeding one piece of</text>
  <text start="1999.8" dur="4.56">metal into this machine and he realized</text>
  <text start="2001.6" dur="4.26">it was shaped incorrectly and he knew</text>
  <text start="2004.36" dur="3.93">there was going to be a problem as soon</text>
  <text start="2005.86" dur="5.31">as the doors on the machine closed the</text>
  <text start="2008.29" dur="4.5">metal kicked back blew the door open and</text>
  <text start="2011.17" dur="4.26">the door hit his thumb and dislocated it</text>

  <text start="2056.2" dur="3.99">throwing Bibles down to the street to</text>
  <text start="2058.15" dur="3.69">women who were catching them and shoving</text>
  <text start="2060.19" dur="4.44">them inside their burkas and hiding them</text>
  <text start="2061.84" dur="5.13">and she knew it was a traveling the</text>
  <text start="2064.63" dur="3.84">spirit experience because when the box</text>
  <text start="2066.97" dur="3.72">of books was empty</text>
  <text start="2068.47" dur="3.63">yeah the women said hey we need more</text>
  <text start="2070.69" dur="3.989">Bibles and she said we&amp;#39;re out we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2072.1" dur="4.53">have anymore right she took the one that</text>
  <text start="2074.679" dur="6.721">she had left in her hand and she said as</text>
  <text start="2076.63" dur="7.92">I threw it down to the ground I all of a</text>
  <text start="2081.4" dur="6.51">sudden landed in my bed and I was not</text>
  <text start="2084.55" dur="5.76">there but I was thrown into my bed and I</text>
  <text start="2087.91" dur="6.06">landed hard on my bed as if I had fallen</text>
  <text start="2090.31" dur="4.56">off of something right right so I have a</text>
  <text start="2093.97" dur="2.37">lot of friends who have these</text>
  <text start="2094.87" dur="2.94">experiences and those Wow</text>
  <text start="2096.34" dur="3.18">those are kind of where your physical</text>
  <text start="2097.81" dur="3.81">body is probably being transported</text>
  <text start="2099.52" dur="4.38">somewhere else I&amp;#39;ll actually there was I</text>
  <text start="2101.62" dur="4.02">actually there&amp;#39;s a gentleman who goes to</text>
  <text start="2103.9" dur="2.91">my church who had shared a story it was</text>
  <text start="2105.64" dur="2.43">the first time I ever heard of anything</text>
  <text start="2106.81" dur="4.32">like this and he was talking about a</text>
  <text start="2108.07" dur="5.19">time where he&amp;#39;s like I was in I was here</text>
  <text start="2111.13" dur="4.29">in Florida but all of a sudden I was in</text>
  <text start="2113.26" dur="4.8">California and I kept a car accident</text>
  <text start="2115.42" dur="5.97">from happening I protected somebody from</text>
  <text start="2118.06" dur="4.92">getting from dying in a car accident and</text>
  <text start="2121.39" dur="3.96">then I was back in Florida then he was</text>
  <text start="2122.98" dur="6.33">back in Florida yeah that is a really</text>
  <text start="2125.35" dur="5.16">common experience I had never ever heard</text>
  <text start="2129.31" dur="2.25">I guess that&amp;#39;s one of those things most</text>
  <text start="2130.51" dur="2.52">people probably don&amp;#39;t even really want</text>
  <text start="2131.56" dur="3.06">to talk about it but once you open up</text>
  <text start="2133.03" dur="3.66">and start to share experiences people</text>
  <text start="2134.62" dur="4.38">like I&amp;#39;ve had that yeah people don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2136.69" dur="4.26">want to talk about it because they are</text>
  <text start="2139" dur="3.06">afraid that people are going to either</text>
  <text start="2140.95" dur="3.6">think they&amp;#39;re crazy they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2142.06" dur="4.2">hallucinating or they have heard of</text>
  <text start="2144.55" dur="4.35">other people share their experiences and</text>
  <text start="2146.26" dur="4.29">they have been dismissed or criticized</text>
  <text start="2148.9" dur="4.11">or church leaders will tell them that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2150.55" dur="4.74">witchcraft so there&amp;#39;s a lot of fear but</text>
  <text start="2153.01" dur="3.43">when I started having public discussions</text>
  <text start="2155.29" dur="2.95">on Facebook</text>
  <text start="2156.44" dur="3.59">about this people came out of the</text>
  <text start="2158.24" dur="4.109">woodwork talked about their experiences</text>
  <text start="2160.03" dur="4.089">why they were they lot some of them</text>
  <text start="2162.349" dur="3.661">literally said I can&amp;#39;t believe anyone&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2164.119" dur="3.841">actually hosting a public discussion on</text>
  <text start="2166.01" dur="4.319">this because I&amp;#39;ve had these experiences</text>
  <text start="2167.96" dur="5.49">and I&amp;#39;ve never know who I could talk to</text>
  <text start="2170.329" dur="5.871">about it so Wow so the second type of</text>
  <text start="2173.45" dur="5.72">experience in is what we call</text>
  <text start="2176.2" dur="5.5">translation or translation by faith</text>
  <text start="2179.17" dur="5.53">implication with translation is your</text>
  <text start="2181.7" dur="4.619">physical body stays where it is but your</text>
  <text start="2184.7" dur="6.149">spirit goes somewhere else</text>
  <text start="2186.319" dur="6.991">mm-hmm okay so this is the more common</text>
  <text start="2190.849" dur="4.02">experience that people have okay a lot</text>
  <text start="2193.31" dur="4.41">of people will be sitting in church and</text>
  <text start="2194.869" dur="4.801">they&amp;#39;ll be in worship and I&amp;#39;ll have</text>
  <text start="2197.72" dur="4.08">their eyes closed and suddenly they</text>
  <text start="2199.67" dur="3.78">realize wow I think I&amp;#39;m standing in the</text>
  <text start="2201.8" dur="5.1">throne room of heaven and I&amp;#39;ve seen the</text>
  <text start="2203.45" dur="5.31">Lord and I see angels around me and wow</text>
  <text start="2206.9" dur="4.38">what is that creature over there and oh</text>
  <text start="2208.76" dur="4.349">oh am I in the River of Life now they</text>
  <text start="2211.28" dur="4.559">have these experiences where in their</text>
  <text start="2213.109" dur="5.131">mind they&amp;#39;re aware that their spirit is</text>
  <text start="2215.839" dur="3.931">somewhere else and all the time they are</text>
  <text start="2218.24" dur="3.57">still aware that their physical body is</text>
  <text start="2219.77" dur="4.5">still standing in church in worship a</text>
  <text start="2221.81" dur="4.95">lot of people have those experiences I</text>
  <text start="2224.27" dur="5.79">have them quite often when I&amp;#39;m praying I</text>
  <text start="2226.76" dur="5.79">will be in my chair and the Lord will</text>
  <text start="2230.06" dur="4.289">show me he&amp;#39;ll take me into a visionary</text>
  <text start="2232.55" dur="3.39">experience where I see things in the</text>
  <text start="2234.349" dur="4.171">throne room or I see things in other</text>
  <text start="2235.94" dur="5.28">places in heaven I have gone to the</text>
  <text start="2238.52" dur="4.89">different courts of heaven and pleaded</text>
  <text start="2241.22" dur="4.2">cases for people and although all the</text>
  <text start="2243.41" dur="5.07">time my physical body is here in my</text>
  <text start="2245.42" dur="5.909">house but my spirit is there having an</text>
  <text start="2248.48" dur="6.72">experience in the heavens and then you</text>
  <text start="2251.329" dur="5.701">remember what happened oh yeah yeah I am</text>

  <text start="2352.98" dur="3.03">he sends me prayer requests from time to</text>
  <text start="2354.9" dur="3.39">time and he asked me to pray for this</text>
  <text start="2356.01" dur="4.29">friend of his and I said sure man I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2358.29" dur="5.16">praying for him now we&amp;#39;re on Facebook</text>
  <text start="2360.3" dur="5.73">we&amp;#39;re on chat and literally 10 minutes</text>
  <text start="2363.45" dur="5.46">after he sends me this prayer request he</text>
  <text start="2366.03" dur="4.71">said I have a question for you I was</text>
  <text start="2368.91" dur="3.09">talking to my friend the one that you</text>
  <text start="2370.74" dur="6.03">were praying for and he wanted to know</text>
  <text start="2372" dur="6.54">why you showed up in his house I said</text>
  <text start="2376.77" dur="3.03">what do you mean he was well as soon as</text>
  <text start="2378.54" dur="3.18">I told them that you were praying for</text>
  <text start="2379.8" dur="6">him he said he saw a man standing over</text>
  <text start="2381.72" dur="7.44">him who was praying for him now I have</text>
  <text start="2385.8" dur="6.18">no awareness of this at all we know like</text>
  <text start="2389.16" dur="5.19">how is it that so okay how is that so</text>
  <text start="2391.98" dur="3.9">like I&amp;#39;m in her room you were in his</text>
  <text start="2394.35" dur="4.68">house but we have absolutely no idea</text>
  <text start="2395.88" dur="6.27">that I have it right let me explain what</text>
  <text start="2399.03" dur="5.7">I think is going on I get a ton of</text>
  <text start="2402.15" dur="4.83">prayer requests and most of them are</text>
  <text start="2404.73" dur="4.98">through email and private message what</text>
  <text start="2406.98" dur="4.38">I&amp;#39;ve been aware of is and and here is</text>
  <text start="2409.71" dur="6.84">the thing about traveling the spirit</text>
  <text start="2411.36" dur="7.35">this is the key it is awareness you did</text>
  <text start="2416.55" dur="2.7">you were more aware of what you were</text>
  <text start="2418.71" dur="3.57">doing</text>
  <text start="2419.25" dur="4.77">you would actually sense that you were</text>
  <text start="2422.28" dur="4.35">somewhere else and here&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="2424.02" dur="4.44">so when I great when I prayed for this</text>
  <text start="2426.63" dur="6.54">guy in Africa one time I think he was in</text>
  <text start="2428.46" dur="6.27">Nigeria he had malaria okay and so I got</text>
  <text start="2433.17" dur="5.28">a prayer request unlike a lot of prayer</text>
  <text start="2434.73" dur="5.4">requests I close my eyes and I started</text>
  <text start="2438.45" dur="5.94">praying and in this particular</text>
  <text start="2440.13" dur="6.12">experience I actually saw him in a</text>
  <text start="2444.39" dur="4.08">vision in my mind&amp;#39;s eye I saw him</text>
  <text start="2446.25" dur="4.92">sitting in front of me okay and I had my</text>
  <text start="2448.47" dur="4.08">hands out like I was gonna touch his</text>
  <text start="2451.17" dur="3.15">shoulders and I was just praying over</text>
  <text start="2452.55" dur="5.66">him he sent me a private message and</text>
  <text start="2454.32" dur="8.07">next day that he was healed of malaria I</text>
  <text start="2458.21" dur="7.54">didn&amp;#39;t tell him that I sensed that I was</text>
  <text start="2462.39" dur="5.31">actually better in the spirit wow it is</text>
  <text start="2465.75" dur="3.63">interesting because Paul says in several</text>
  <text start="2467.7" dur="5.04">places in his letters he said I am with</text>
  <text start="2469.38" dur="7.52">you in spirit or am the I am absent in</text>
  <text start="2472.74" dur="4.16">the body but with you in spirit you know</text>
  <text start="2478.82" dur="6.37">right but as I have these experiences I</text>
  <text start="2482.609" dur="5.131">think Paul was actually going there in</text>
  <text start="2485.19" dur="5.07">the spirit and like laying hands and</text>
  <text start="2487.74" dur="4.26">praying over people I suspect that that</text>
  <text start="2490.26" dur="3.359">Paul was doing a lot more spiritual</text>
  <text start="2492" dur="4.349">traveling to most people aware if you</text>
  <text start="2493.619" dur="4.321">study the lives of Elijah and Elijah you</text>
  <text start="2496.349" dur="4.26">will come to the same conclusion these</text>
  <text start="2497.94" dur="5.07">guys were we&amp;#39;re traveling the spirit and</text>
  <text start="2500.609" dur="4.531">one of passage of the thickets I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2503.01" dur="6.78">fit 2nd Kings chapter 5 at chapter 6</text>
  <text start="2505.14" dur="7.199">Elijah says go tell King Ahab where I am</text>
  <text start="2509.79" dur="3.809">and I think it&amp;#39;s Obadiah and Obadiah</text>
  <text start="2512.339" dur="4.231">says I&amp;#39;m not going to tell him anything</text>
  <text start="2513.599" dur="4.861">because you and I both know as soon as I</text>
  <text start="2516.57" dur="3.269">go to the king and tell him you&amp;#39;re here</text>
  <text start="2518.46" dur="2.909">the spirit Lord is gonna take you</text>
  <text start="2519.839" dur="2.641">somewhere else and the King&amp;#39;s gonna come</text>
  <text start="2521.369" dur="1.621">and find you not there and he&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="2522.48" dur="3.45">kill me</text>
  <text start="2522.99" dur="5.129">because Obadiah knew that the Prophet</text>
  <text start="2525.93" dur="4.86">was being moved around by the Lord and</text>
  <text start="2528.119" dur="7.261">then in another passage Israel was at</text>
  <text start="2530.79" dur="8.64">war and the king that they were at war</text>
  <text start="2535.38" dur="7.32">against accused his people in his inner</text>
  <text start="2539.43" dur="5.73">circle of betraying him because Israel</text>
  <text start="2542.7" dur="5.07">had such accurate information about the</text>
  <text start="2545.16" dur="4.53">troop positions he said someone is</text>
  <text start="2547.77" dur="5.73">telling them things that i only talk</text>
  <text start="2549.69" dur="6.86">about in my bedroom now the Prophet had</text>
  <text start="2553.5" dur="4.45">all this same it was Elisha had already</text>
  <text start="2556.55" dur="3.5">demonstrated that he</text>
  <text start="2557.95" dur="4.68">is following people in the spirit to</text>
  <text start="2560.05" dur="4.26">check up on them and it&amp;#39;s my belief that</text>
  <text start="2562.63" dur="4.56">he was traveling the spirit over to the</text>
  <text start="2564.31" dur="4.44">Kings bedchambers getting information in</text>
  <text start="2567.19" dur="3.87">the spirit and coming back and telling</text>
  <text start="2568.75" dur="4.109">the king of Israel what the troop</text>
  <text start="2571.06" dur="3.779">placements were gonna be if you look</text>
  <text start="2572.859" dur="4.081">through the Scriptures you&amp;#39;ll find a lot</text>
  <text start="2574.839" dur="4.081">more spiritual traveling going on well a</text>
  <text start="2576.94" dur="3.96">very common one that a lot of people</text>
  <text start="2578.92" dur="5.07">don&amp;#39;t pick up on his in John chapter 6</text>
  <text start="2580.9" dur="6">okay Jesus comes walking upon the water</text>
  <text start="2583.99" dur="5.04">in a storm in the middle of the night to</text>
  <text start="2586.9" dur="4.56">the disciples who were in a boat now it</text>
  <text start="2589.03" dur="4.47">says it says they were in the midst</text>
  <text start="2591.46" dur="4.889">middle of the sea after they had rowed</text>
  <text start="2593.5" dur="4.05">about I think it was three or four hours</text>
  <text start="2596.349" dur="4.081">they were in the middle of the Sea of</text>
  <text start="2597.55" dur="5.22">Galilee it says the Lord appears to them</text>
  <text start="2600.43" dur="4.23">and here comes Jesus and they&amp;#39;re afraid</text>
  <text start="2602.77" dur="4.17">and he says do not be afraid to me he</text>
  <text start="2604.66" dur="4.86">gets in the boat and the last thing it</text>
  <text start="2606.94" dur="7.409">says is and the boat was immediately at</text>
  <text start="2609.52" dur="6.69">land no hey now you don&amp;#39;t even realize</text>
  <text start="2614.349" dur="3.99">what what that says that&amp;#39;s saying that</text>
  <text start="2616.21" dur="4.53">he Jesus into the sciples were</text>
  <text start="2618.339" dur="5.49">supernaturally transported three or four</text>
  <text start="2620.74" dur="10.17">miles to shore as soon as it got in the</text>
  <text start="2623.829" dur="9.301">boat did not catch that if you read</text>
  <text start="2630.91" dur="4.5">through this just carefully you&amp;#39;ll find</text>
  <text start="2633.13" dur="5.699">all kinds of strange things like that</text>
  <text start="2635.41" dur="6.449">going on that is really easy to miss Wow</text>
  <text start="2638.829" dur="6.571">the point of it is where this all</text>
  <text start="2641.859" dur="7.141">started was in 2010 the Lord gave me a</text>
  <text start="2645.4" dur="6.12">series of dreams this is the key thing</text>

  <text start="2883.12" dur="3.9">I&amp;#39;m there on the overpass and there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2884.86" dur="4.74">freeway going below me and I can see a</text>
  <text start="2887.02" dur="3.6">few cars traveling to and from going in</text>
  <text start="2889.6" dur="3.09">different directions on the on the</text>
  <text start="2890.62" dur="6">freeway I&amp;#39;m standing in front of an</text>
  <text start="2892.69" dur="6.72">off-ramp it was a two lane off-ramp it</text>
  <text start="2896.62" dur="5.37">had one lane of going onto the freeway</text>
  <text start="2899.41" dur="5.64">and one lane of traffic coming off right</text>

  <text start="2913.69" dur="4.47">and off coming traffic a set of cones</text>
  <text start="2916.12" dur="4.73">were set up between the two lanes of</text>
  <text start="2918.16" dur="6.03">traffic but that was temporary because</text>
  <text start="2920.85" dur="5.68">there was more capacity for getting on</text>
  <text start="2924.19" dur="5.46">and getting off this freeway was being</text>
  <text start="2926.53" dur="6.03">built right right all right so I&amp;#39;ve been</text>
  <text start="2929.65" dur="7.53">asking the Lord about that how what that</text>
  <text start="2932.56" dur="8.18">means and he said he said look think of</text>
