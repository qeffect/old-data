  <text start="172.709" dur="6.241">of weeks on supernatural Saturday I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="174.84" dur="7.019">going to dig into the questions why some</text>
  <text start="178.95" dur="7.23">people are not healed the thing that</text>
  <text start="181.859" dur="6">makes my book on healing a little</text>
  <text start="186.18" dur="3.899">different from the books that most</text>
  <text start="187.859" dur="6.241">people have written on healing is I</text>
  <text start="190.079" dur="7.771">actually have done a bit of research</text>
  <text start="194.1" dur="5.4">trial and error God has given me some</text>
  <text start="197.85" dur="5.58">some understanding of why people are not</text>
  <text start="199.5" dur="5.7">healed through dreams and so one of the</text>
  <text start="203.43" dur="4.95">things that I that I teach on in the</text>
  <text start="205.2" dur="5.28">book is why people aren&amp;#39;t healed right</text>
  <text start="208.38" dur="4.259">there are reasons why people are not</text>
  <text start="210.48" dur="5.43">healed and it&amp;#39;s not just because you</text>
  <text start="212.639" dur="8.88">don&amp;#39;t have faith we are going to be in</text>
  <text start="215.91" dur="7.74">chapter 22 of the book and that chapter</text>
  <text start="221.519" dur="5.821">is called receiving your healing all</text>
  <text start="223.65" dur="8.179">right so it&amp;#39;s important to understand</text>
  <text start="227.34" dur="8.18">that in the realm of divine healing</text>
  <text start="231.829" dur="6.751">there is there&amp;#39;s a role that is</text>
  <text start="235.52" dur="4.44">laid by the healer and there is a role</text>
  <text start="238.58" dur="4.82">that is played by the person who</text>
  <text start="239.96" dur="7.68">receives the healing all right</text>
  <text start="243.4" dur="7.81">typically with divine healing with New</text>
  <text start="247.64" dur="7.56">Testament healing the person who is</text>
  <text start="251.21" dur="8.55">going to be the healer right is expected</text>
  <text start="255.2" dur="9.24">to have faith jesus said that he really</text>
  <text start="259.76" dur="7.83">taught that the release of power and the</text>
  <text start="264.44" dur="6.92">exercise of authority Jesus gave His</text>
  <text start="267.59" dur="3.77">disciples power give them authority</text>
  <text start="271.78" dur="4.42">check that out Matthew chapter 10 Luke</text>
  <text start="274.52" dur="4.38">chapter 9 after he called the twelve</text>
  <text start="276.2" dur="6.98">disciples he gave them power authority</text>
  <text start="278.9" dur="6.75">over sickness and to heal diseases and</text>
  <text start="283.18" dur="4.75">we use generally use authority for</text>
  <text start="285.65" dur="4.68">deliverance we also use it to get rid of</text>
  <text start="287.93" dur="5.18">sickness and disease we release power to</text>
  <text start="290.33" dur="6.84">could work creative miracles all right</text>
  <text start="293.11" dur="9.22">power and authority power is released</text>
  <text start="297.17" dur="8.88">authority is exercised by faith when you</text>
  <text start="302.33" dur="4.77">believe if I believe I&amp;#39;m gonna lay hands</text>
  <text start="306.05" dur="4.23">on that person and they&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="307.1" dur="4.74">healed that faith releases the power it</text>
  <text start="310.28" dur="4.95">is how I exercise authority with my</text>
  <text start="311.84" dur="5.96">faith all right now that is the role of</text>
  <text start="315.23" dur="10.59">the healer the role of the receiver is</text>
  <text start="317.8" dur="12.06">to receive the healing okay now in order</text>
  <text start="325.82" dur="6.78">to help illustrate how being a receiver</text>
  <text start="329.86" dur="4.86">works that an emic of being a receiver</text>
  <text start="332.6" dur="7.86">I&amp;#39;m going to talk a little bit about</text>
  <text start="334.72" dur="8.47">American football I need to draw an</text>
  <text start="340.46" dur="6.02">analogy the best way that I can is to</text>
  <text start="343.19" dur="5.85">use American football as a as a</text>
  <text start="346.48" dur="4.03">comparison all right so if you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="349.04" dur="4.19">know anything about American football</text>
  <text start="350.51" dur="6.51">I&amp;#39;m going to give you a just a short</text>
  <text start="353.23" dur="9.43">education on American football all right</text>
  <text start="357.02" dur="8.19">in American football the goal of the</text>
  <text start="362.66" dur="5.85">team is to take the football and move it</text>
  <text start="365.21" dur="4.17">down the field on this grass with lines</text>
  <text start="368.51" dur="2.64">on it</text>
  <text start="369.38" dur="4.23">and there are several ways you can do it</text>
  <text start="371.15" dur="4.8">they can take the ball and they can run</text>
  <text start="373.61" dur="3.9">it until they&amp;#39;re tackled or they can you</text>
  <text start="375.95" dur="5.13">have a quarterback we can pass the ball</text>
  <text start="377.51" dur="8.91">to a receiver receiver catches the ball</text>
  <text start="381.08" dur="9.35">okay and there are a lot of dynamics</text>
  <text start="386.42" dur="8.67">involved in being a receiver in football</text>
  <text start="390.43" dur="9.4">first of all there&amp;#39;s timing if a if the</text>
  <text start="395.09" dur="8.07">quarterback throws the ball let&amp;#39;s say 30</text>
  <text start="399.83" dur="6.3">or 40 yards downfield the receiver has</text>
  <text start="403.16" dur="4.65">to run and keep running and they have to</text>
  <text start="406.13" dur="5.49">meet that ball wherever that ball is</text>
  <text start="407.81" dur="5.01">gonna land they have to run a route they</text>
  <text start="411.62" dur="3.87">have to know where the quarterback is</text>
  <text start="412.82" dur="4.98">going to throw the pass you have to run</text>
  <text start="415.49" dur="6.3">the correct route they have to focus</text>
  <text start="417.8" dur="7.38">they have to catch the ball oh great</text>
  <text start="421.79" dur="5.96">Peter Coco is talking to us hang on I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="425.18" dur="6.11">gonna turn my notifications down on my</text>
  <text start="427.75" dur="7.95">phone so that we&amp;#39;re not getting these</text>
  <text start="431.29" dur="4.41">sounds while I&amp;#39;m broadcasting all right</text>
  <text start="436.27" dur="7.09">so the receiver has to focus on the ball</text>
  <text start="441.1" dur="3.97">coordinate with the quarterback know</text>
  <text start="443.36" dur="3.69">where the ball is going there&amp;#39;s also</text>
  <text start="445.07" dur="3.6">someone trying to tackle them in trying</text>
  <text start="447.05" dur="5.01">to get the ball away from them there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="448.67" dur="6.03">defender all right the defenders job is</text>
  <text start="452.06" dur="8.58">to make sure the receiver doesn&amp;#39;t catch</text>
  <text start="454.7" dur="7.86">the ball all right the defender can</text>
  <text start="460.64" dur="4.29">tackle the receiver can intercept the</text>
  <text start="462.56" dur="4.62">ball can distract them hit them hard</text>
  <text start="464.93" dur="4.53">caused them to be a little bit fearful</text>
  <text start="467.18" dur="3.57">of catching the ball if you know that</text>
  <text start="469.46" dur="3.78">when you catch that ball someone&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="470.75" dur="3.78">hit you in the ribcage and knock you</text>
  <text start="473.24" dur="4.38">down that might make you a little</text>
  <text start="474.53" dur="9">fearful right now we&amp;#39;re getting into the</text>
  <text start="477.62" dur="8.28">warfare of healing so as a receiver in</text>
  <text start="483.53" dur="6.93">football you have to do a number of</text>
  <text start="485.9" dur="7.35">things simultaneously you have to catch</text>
  <text start="490.46" dur="5.7">the ball run with the ball avoid being</text>
  <text start="493.25" dur="4.29">hit by the by the defender you have to</text>
  <text start="496.16" dur="3.29">coordinate with the quarterback there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="497.54" dur="5.4">a lot of things that need to go on for a</text>
  <text start="499.45" dur="7.51">receiver to be a good be a good</text>
  <text start="502.94" dur="7.23">an effective receiver right in healing</text>
  <text start="506.96" dur="7.709">in divine healing a lot of those same</text>
  <text start="510.17" dur="8.52">principles apply to divine healing there</text>
  <text start="514.669" dur="6.601">is an enemy that stands against us who</text>
  <text start="518.69" dur="5.73">doesn&amp;#39;t want us to be healed they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="521.27" dur="6.75">want us to receive our healing jesus</text>
  <text start="524.42" dur="7.88">said in John 10:10 the enemy comes the</text>
  <text start="528.02" dur="6.63">thief comes to steal kill and destroy I</text>
  <text start="532.3" dur="3.4">have come that you might have life and</text>
  <text start="534.65" dur="4.74">that more abundantly</text>
  <text start="535.7" dur="6">alright so Jesus came to represent the</text>
  <text start="539.39" dur="4.92">nature of God he came to release the</text>
  <text start="541.7" dur="5.37">power of God he came to manifest the</text>
  <text start="544.31" dur="5.88">love and the goodness of God Jesus said</text>
  <text start="547.07" dur="7.04">I come that you might have life and that</text>
  <text start="550.19" dur="6.78">would be an abundant life jesus healed</text>
  <text start="554.11" dur="3.34">everyone who ever came to him to be</text>
  <text start="556.97" dur="4.89">healed</text>
  <text start="557.45" dur="6.78">hehe all of them without exception no</text>
  <text start="561.86" dur="6.3">one that Jesus ever ministered to was</text>
  <text start="564.23" dur="6.48">not healed Jesus came to reveal the will</text>
  <text start="568.16" dur="8.25">of the Father it is always God&amp;#39;s will to</text>
  <text start="570.71" dur="9.86">heal everyone because if it was if it</text>
  <text start="576.41" dur="7.26">was not God&amp;#39;s will to heal everyone</text>
  <text start="580.57" dur="4.72">then Jesus frustrated the will of God</text>
  <text start="583.67" dur="4.05">more than any person who ever lived</text>
  <text start="585.29" dur="6.5">because He healed everyone he healed</text>
  <text start="587.72" dur="7.95">entire villages all right</text>
  <text start="591.79" dur="8.32">God&amp;#39;s will is for all of us to be healed</text>
  <text start="595.67" dur="7.64">every single time we have to understand</text>
  <text start="600.11" dur="7.83">what the obstructions are to healing</text>
  <text start="603.31" dur="7.18">sometimes it&amp;#39;s demons Matthew chapter 17</text>
  <text start="607.94" dur="6.69">the disciples couldn&amp;#39;t heal a boy who</text>
  <text start="610.49" dur="8.87">had epilepsy they took the boy to Jesus</text>
  <text start="614.63" dur="9.42">the father and Jesus cast out the demon</text>
  <text start="619.36" dur="7.06">right so sometimes there are things that</text>
  <text start="624.05" dur="4.47">have to be involved like casting out</text>
  <text start="626.42" dur="4.04">demons I have found that emotional</text>
  <text start="628.52" dur="4.44">healing is a major component of</text>
  <text start="630.46" dur="5.29">receiving physical healing there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="632.96" dur="3.299">emotional healing jesus said I&amp;#39;ve come</text>
  <text start="635.75" dur="2.85">to heal</text>
  <text start="636.259" dur="5.25">the brokenhearted what is it broken</text>
  <text start="638.6" dur="5.129">hearted broken heart is emotional wounds</text>
  <text start="641.509" dur="5.22">so he wants us physically healed he also</text>
  <text start="643.729" dur="6.54">wants us emotionally healed actually</text>
  <text start="646.729" dur="6.991">Kazuko a friend of ours who&amp;#39;s on the</text>

  <text start="1179.1" dur="4.68">office and she rolled her pant leg up</text>
  <text start="1181.62" dur="4.28">and it was still swollen it was I could</text>
  <text start="1183.78" dur="5.279">still see the kneecap was kind of</text>
  <text start="1185.9" dur="5.83">deviated over to one side and I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="1189.059" dur="4.831">painful and I said you&amp;#39;re not afraid she</text>
  <text start="1191.73" dur="4.68">said nope and I said okay let&amp;#39;s do this</text>
  <text start="1193.89" dur="5.91">so I put my hand right above her knee I</text>
  <text start="1196.41" dur="6.45">released power I commanded the lips the</text>
  <text start="1199.8" dur="5.07">tendons and nerves cartilage and he kept</text>
  <text start="1202.86" dur="3.12">to be healed the meniscus healed I just</text>
  <text start="1204.87" dur="3.9">commanded all those things to be healed</text>
  <text start="1205.98" dur="5.97">she could immediately feel heat going</text>
  <text start="1208.77" dur="5.4">into her knee I did the same thing a</text>
  <text start="1211.95" dur="4.68">second time she felt more heat going</text>
  <text start="1214.17" dur="4.71">into her knee I did it a third time she</text>
  <text start="1216.63" dur="6.87">could felt continually felt heat or</text>
  <text start="1218.88" dur="7.11">energy going into her knee and she got</text>
  <text start="1223.5" dur="5.01">up she walked around the station and she</text>
  <text start="1225.99" dur="8.85">had no pain at all swelling was gone</text>
  <text start="1228.51" dur="10.799">pain was completely gone so that they I</text>
  <text start="1234.84" dur="6.96">learned and she learned that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1239.309" dur="6.241">she it wasn&amp;#39;t that she wasn&amp;#39;t healed</text>
  <text start="1241.8" dur="5.93">because God didn&amp;#39;t want to heal her she</text>
  <text start="1245.55" dur="6.66">wasn&amp;#39;t healed because she was fearful</text>
  <text start="1247.73" dur="7.39">she couldn&amp;#39;t receive God&amp;#39;s goodness but</text>
  <text start="1252.21" dur="5.13">when she got rid of her fear and she</text>
  <text start="1255.12" dur="4.91">came and asked me and said look I want</text>
  <text start="1257.34" dur="6.87">to be healed I&amp;#39;m not afraid anymore</text>
  <text start="1260.03" dur="7">boom she received God&amp;#39;s healing the same</text>
  <text start="1264.21" dur="5.78">power was available to heal her the</text>
  <text start="1267.03" dur="6.36">first time but she couldn&amp;#39;t receive it</text>
  <text start="1269.99" dur="8.189">after she get rid of her fear she was</text>
  <text start="1273.39" dur="8.1">able to receive the healing okay and</text>
  <text start="1278.179" dur="6.821">that is that is the lesson about</text>
  <text start="1281.49" dur="7.02">receiving God&amp;#39;s healing there are things</text>
  <text start="1285" dur="7.8">that that we have in our life that can</text>
  <text start="1288.51" dur="8.1">actually prevent us from receiving the</text>
  <text start="1292.8" dur="8.73">fullness of God&amp;#39;s goodness his power his</text>
  <text start="1296.61" dur="6.9">provision his love his divine destiny</text>
  <text start="1301.53" dur="2.34">that he has for us a lot of times we</text>
  <text start="1303.51" dur="2.09">read</text>
  <text start="1303.87" dur="7.22">checked what God wants to give us</text>
  <text start="1305.6" dur="8.35">because we are full of fear doubt</text>
  <text start="1311.09" dur="4.33">skepticism we don&amp;#39;t understand our</text>

  <text start="1315.42" dur="3.75">she loves us we don&amp;#39;t unders we have a</text>
  <text start="1317.04" dur="4.59">lot of wrong understanding of God and</text>
  <text start="1319.17" dur="6.69">that many times prevents us from</text>
  <text start="1321.63" dur="8.48">receiving what he wants to give us so</text>
  <text start="1325.86" dur="6.36">and that is today&amp;#39;s lesson look</text>
  <text start="1330.11" dur="6.34">sometimes people are not healed because</text>
  <text start="1332.22" dur="7.02">they have things in their mind the enemy</text>
  <text start="1336.45" dur="5.609">has gotten inside their mind and is kind</text>
  <text start="1339.24" dur="7.17">of messed up their thinking and you know</text>

  <text start="1366.929" dur="6.241">the kingdom of God has come and a lot of</text>
  <text start="1369.27" dur="6.03">what we need to do in order to receive</text>

  <text start="1386.99" dur="6.46">deity up there who wants to smite us and</text>
  <text start="1389.67" dur="6.15">strike us dead if we screw up he is full</text>
  <text start="1393.45" dur="5.52">of love full of mercy and compassion and</text>
  <text start="1395.82" dur="8.28">he wants us to be healed he wants us to</text>
  <text start="1398.97" dur="6.72">be blessed he wants to prosper us and we</text>

  <text start="1405.69" dur="9.739">if we want to they will receive that all</text>
  <text start="1409.14" dur="6.289">right I am going to take some questions</text>
  <text start="1416.87" dur="5.82">let&amp;#39;s see let me go over to Facebook and</text>
  <text start="1419.64" dur="9.959">see if there&amp;#39;s any questions in here</text>
  <text start="1422.69" dur="12.75">where is the facebook chat alright</text>
  <text start="1429.599" dur="5.841">nothing showed up on periscope</text>
  <text start="1451.25" dur="5.37">are there instances where the faith for</text>
  <text start="1454.13" dur="5.22">healing only on the healer and not the</text>
  <text start="1456.62" dur="4.32">receiver yes there are many times it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1459.35" dur="5.85">actually a very good question</text>
  <text start="1460.94" dur="7.609">Dottie there are times when the person</text>
  <text start="1465.2" dur="5.52">who needs to be healed where their faith</text>

  <text start="1475.64" dur="8.039">disciples a woman with a flow of blood</text>
  <text start="1478.84" dur="7.18">kind of crept up behind him and she knew</text>
