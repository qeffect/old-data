  <text start="223.9" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s the small book the big one is is</text>
  <text start="227.62" dur="4.44">they you me or the devil that I was</text>
  <text start="230.65" dur="2.96">looking at that one I&amp;#39;m like wow that</text>
  <text start="232.06" dur="4.65">book is three hundred and sixty pages</text>
  <text start="233.61" dur="5.5">that is a heavy duty training manual</text>
  <text start="236.71" dur="5">yeah I wrote it that way cuz I wanted it</text>
  <text start="239.11" dur="5.49">I wanted to cover as much as I could</text>
  <text start="241.71" dur="4.96">because I really would like for people</text>
  <text start="244.6" dur="3.42">to sit down and not you know when you</text>
  <text start="246.67" dur="3.18">write a small book sometimes people had</text>
  <text start="248.02" dur="2.16">a temptation to just run right through</text>
  <text start="249.85" dur="2.22">it</text>
  <text start="250.18" dur="3.63">and then they don&amp;#39;t go back so I like</text>
  <text start="252.07" dur="3.66">having something that they can go back</text>
  <text start="253.81" dur="4.26">to over and over again because I</text>
  <text start="255.73" dur="4.319">actually go back to it myself over and</text>
  <text start="258.07" dur="4.02">over again and I wrote it though I I</text>
  <text start="260.049" dur="4.501">have to do that myself with my own books</text>
  <text start="262.09" dur="5.73">because I teach on so many different</text>
  <text start="264.55" dur="5.79">subjects when I want to do a teaching on</text>
  <text start="267.82" dur="5.19">something I haven&amp;#39;t taught on in a while</text>
  <text start="270.34" dur="4.95">I will sometimes have to go back to a</text>
  <text start="273.01" dur="5.34">chapter on a book I wrote and refresh my</text>
  <text start="275.29" dur="5.73">memory you when you were young you met</text>
  <text start="278.35" dur="5.4">an evangelist who&amp;#39;s a young evangelist</text>
  <text start="281.02" dur="3.78">and he was speaking to God back and</text>
  <text start="283.75" dur="2.28">forth at</text>
  <text start="284.8" dur="3.6">this meeting where people were getting</text>
  <text start="286.03" dur="4.59">knocked over in this spirit and at that</text>
  <text start="288.4" dur="4.41">time you didn&amp;#39;t actually understand the</text>
  <text start="290.62" dur="4.139">whole concept of a personal God who</text>
  <text start="292.81" dur="3.93">talks to people can you tell us a little</text>
  <text start="294.759" dur="5.611">bit about that day when you met that guy</text>
  <text start="296.74" dur="6.48">and how that changed your mind that was</text>
  <text start="300.37" dur="5.22">an interesting day because I had grown</text>
  <text start="303.22" dur="4.71">up in this church and when I was there</text>
  <text start="305.59" dur="4.68">it was when I grew up there was 300</text>
  <text start="307.93" dur="3.959">people and asked up to about eleven</text>
  <text start="310.27" dur="4.29">thousand people but at the time it was</text>
  <text start="311.889" dur="6.33">about two thousand people and the pastor</text>
  <text start="314.56" dur="5.849">there is was to do traditional Baptist</text>
  <text start="318.219" dur="4.92">and that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s always been so I</text>
  <text start="320.409" dur="4.32">didn&amp;#39;t know anything about this stuff I</text>
  <text start="323.139" dur="4.08">didn&amp;#39;t know about speaking in tongues I</text>
  <text start="324.729" dur="5.701">didn&amp;#39;t know I didn&amp;#39;t know anything I had</text>
  <text start="327.219" dur="6.031">never seen any of that before so um when</text>
  <text start="330.43" dur="5.549">he came that night it started with my</text>
  <text start="333.25" dur="4.05">pastor he met my pastor my pastor was</text>
  <text start="335.979" dur="2.91">saying he didn&amp;#39;t believe in that he put</text>
  <text start="337.3" dur="4.38">his hand on my pastor shoulder he was</text>
  <text start="338.889" dur="4.77">out in the parking lot he put his hand</text>
  <text start="341.68" dur="3.75">on your pastors shoulder and your pastor</text>
  <text start="343.659" dur="4.681">went down he went out of the public and</text>
  <text start="345.43" dur="4.709">so he brings this guy to the church and</text>
  <text start="348.34" dur="4.65">at first we thought nothing of it you</text>
  <text start="350.139" dur="4.71">know but he started with the day service</text>
  <text start="352.99" dur="4.38">and he started ministry preached and</text>
  <text start="354.849" dur="5.37">then at the end he ministered and the</text>
  <text start="357.37" dur="6.299">gifts and things and we just thought I</text>
  <text start="360.219" dur="7.741">thought man my pastor is going Satan he</text>
  <text start="363.669" dur="6.211">brought this fake money this is what</text>
  <text start="367.96" dur="3.269">this is about so you thought this guy</text>
  <text start="369.88" dur="3.33">was like from the other from the evil</text>
  <text start="371.229" dur="3.9">side or something so yeah I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="373.21" dur="2.94">I didn&amp;#39;t think it was the devil I just</text>
  <text start="375.129" dur="4.47">thought it wasn&amp;#39;t real</text>
  <text start="376.15" dur="5.729">okay and it wasn&amp;#39;t until later that</text>
  <text start="379.599" dur="4.35">night when he came back to do another</text>
  <text start="381.879" dur="3.331">service now I didn&amp;#39;t think was real bad</text>
  <text start="383.949" dur="4.921">thought it was fascinating so I came</text>
  <text start="385.21" dur="5.819">back that night and I&amp;#39;m looking and I</text>
  <text start="388.87" dur="5.07">have a friend standing next to me and he</text>

  <text start="399.159" dur="5.01">you</text>
  <text start="399.52" dur="6.359">and he said Kevin this guy just what he</text>
  <text start="404.169" dur="3.511">said that something pushed me up against</text>
  <text start="405.879" dur="3.991">the door when I felt like a vacuum in my</text>
  <text start="407.68" dur="4.079">sinus it has been clean so I said okay</text>
  <text start="409.87" dur="4.889">this something&amp;#39;s going on here</text>
  <text start="411.759" dur="5.011">but at the end of the service</text>
  <text start="414.759" dur="3.841">you know this banders had been traveling</text>
  <text start="416.77" dur="3.78">with more cirillo and been all</text>
  <text start="418.6" dur="5.52">the world he never got to come back</text>
  <text start="420.55" dur="5.64">twice and so he said you know I never</text>
  <text start="424.12" dur="4.14">get to come back twice and then he</text>
  <text start="426.19" dur="3.63">stopped right there and he looked up in</text>
  <text start="428.26" dur="3.72">the sky and he&amp;#39;s talking I&amp;#39;m gonna who</text>
  <text start="429.82" dur="5.13">in the world is he talking to then he</text>
  <text start="431.98" dur="4.97">finally said oh yeah okay and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="434.95" dur="5.52">what got me cuz he said okay yeah okay</text>
  <text start="436.95" dur="9.91">then you know he said God said I&amp;#39;ll be</text>
  <text start="440.47" dur="8.34">returning I don&amp;#39;t know what happened</text>
  <text start="446.86" dur="4.23">after that because I was like God talks</text>
  <text start="448.81" dur="4.32">to me and I really wanted him to talk to</text>
  <text start="451.09" dur="3.66">me and so he said something at the end</text>
  <text start="453.13" dur="3.57">of the night that&amp;#39;s really started it</text>
  <text start="454.75" dur="4.11">all for me he said they&amp;#39;re gonna be five</text>
  <text start="456.7" dur="4.56">people now my just mount touka two</text>
  <text start="458.86" dur="4.74">thousand twenty five hundred of us five</text>
  <text start="461.26" dur="4.56">people the Lord is gonna rest with you</text>
  <text start="463.6" dur="4.89">for the next three days I got to be one</text>
  <text start="465.82" dur="5.19">of those five people so I had this</text>
  <text start="468.49" dur="5.16">presence of God on me for there was</text>
  <text start="471.01" dur="4.53">three days three days of walking with</text>
  <text start="473.65" dur="4.38">the presence of God and it just ignited</text>
  <text start="475.54" dur="3.45">something in me to know that we can talk</text>
  <text start="478.03" dur="3.6">to him</text>
  <text start="478.99" dur="4.68">the good part was you know I didn&amp;#39;t I</text>
  <text start="481.63" dur="4.29">hadn&amp;#39;t seen any bad experience you know</text>
  <text start="483.67" dur="3.87">some people had bad prophetic experience</text>
  <text start="485.92" dur="3.27">and they&amp;#39;ve been jaded and so write</text>
  <text start="487.54" dur="3.33">really dated by the whole thing right</text>
  <text start="489.19" dur="4.23">you get a bad experience to get it</text>
  <text start="490.87" dur="4.62">someone is operating on the wrong spirit</text>
  <text start="493.42" dur="3.36">and you get hurt or wounded or whatever</text>
  <text start="495.49" dur="4.35">and it kind of leaves a bad taste in</text>
  <text start="496.78" dur="5.94">your mouth yeah so I didn&amp;#39;t have any of</text>
  <text start="499.84" dur="5.37">that so I ran full steam ahead and then</text>
  <text start="502.72" dur="4.08">I ran into somebody who introduced me to</text>
  <text start="505.21" dur="4.01">Benny Hinn&amp;#39;s book good morning Holy</text>
  <text start="506.8" dur="4.71">Spirit and I read through that and</text>
  <text start="509.22" dur="4.15">listening to him or reading about how</text>
  <text start="511.51" dur="3.33">you know he was spending time with God</text>
  <text start="513.37" dur="3.45">and God actually wanted to spend time</text>
  <text start="514.84" dur="5.61">with him it made me really throw myself</text>
  <text start="516.82" dur="5.7">into the presence of God but I still</text>
  <text start="520.45" dur="4.02">didn&amp;#39;t have a grid for any of it cuz I</text>
  <text start="522.52" dur="5.03">met this traditional church and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="524.47" dur="6.63">talking about this experience and</text>
  <text start="527.55" dur="5.71">nobody&amp;#39;s understanding me talking to God</text>
  <text start="531.1" dur="3.78">they&amp;#39;re not understanding this was</text>
  <text start="533.26" dur="4.35">happening to me they were there for the</text>
  <text start="534.88" dur="3.69">same thing but it didn&amp;#39;t stick with them</text>
  <text start="537.61" dur="2.58">like it stuck with me</text>
  <text start="538.57" dur="4.11">it didn&amp;#39;t impact that the way it</text>
  <text start="540.19" dur="5.22">impacted you it didn&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="542.68" dur="6.99">understand that because when I say it</text>
  <text start="545.41" dur="6.24">was it was a phenomenal night where he</text>
  <text start="549.67" dur="2.92">would wave his handle he or he would</text>
  <text start="551.65" dur="2.5">just say</text>
  <text start="552.59" dur="4.59">the Spirit of God is coming from that</text>
  <text start="554.15" dur="4.08">side he didn&amp;#39;t wave his hand he just</text>
  <text start="557.18" dur="3.72">said he was coming from the left side</text>
  <text start="558.23" dur="3.87">and then something would come Spirit of</text>
  <text start="560.9" dur="2.82">God will come from the left side if</text>
  <text start="562.1" dur="5.61">people would fall like dominoes to the</text>
  <text start="563.72" dur="6.119">left it was an incredible experience</text>
  <text start="567.71" dur="4.95">people getting healed now I&amp;#39;ll tell you</text>
  <text start="569.839" dur="4.921">the turning point for me really happened</text>
  <text start="572.66" dur="4.86">when somebody asked somebody else I knew</text>
  <text start="574.76" dur="4.68">got healed he was deaf in one ear that</text>
  <text start="577.52" dur="4.23">was a shocker for me because I&amp;#39;m like I</text>
  <text start="579.44" dur="3.63">know this guy I know him and I know the</text>
  <text start="581.75" dur="3.93">guy that got pushed up against the door</text>
  <text start="583.07" dur="4.32">the signs from I know the issue so I</text>
  <text start="585.68" dur="5.52">that&amp;#39;s when it all became real for me</text>
  <text start="587.39" dur="6.09">and it&amp;#39;s just been impacting ever since</text>
  <text start="591.2" dur="4.77">me I get emotional even now thinking</text>
  <text start="593.48" dur="4.32">about it because I enjoy I really enjoy</text>
  <text start="595.97" dur="4.05">my relationship with God it&amp;#39;s just you</text>

  <text start="731.45" dur="3.99">Evangelist I will say he reached out he</text>
  <text start="733.79" dur="3.299">started doing words of wisdom and he</text>
  <text start="735.44" dur="3.72">started doing a lot of things then we</text>
  <text start="737.089" dur="4.021">became we went from a traditional</text>
  <text start="739.16" dur="4.23">Baptist Church to a full gospel Baptist</text>
  <text start="741.11" dur="5.01">Church you know we we have classes on</text>

  <text start="752.209" dur="7.44">after I got saved now is 38 years old by</text>
  <text start="755.899" dur="5.671">that time I got into kind of a good</text>
  <text start="759.649" dur="4.171">Bible teaching it was a</text>
  <text start="761.57" dur="4.259">non-denominational Church and they</text>
  <text start="763.82" dur="4.709">taught the gifts of the Spirit but you</text>
  <text start="765.829" dur="4.861">never saw them in practice like nobody</text>
  <text start="768.529" dur="3.901">ever spoke in tongues you never saw</text>
  <text start="770.69" dur="4.079">anyone healed you never heard anyone</text>
  <text start="772.43" dur="3.81">prophesy it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re gonna talk</text>
  <text start="774.769" dur="3.69">about this stuff but we&amp;#39;re not gonna</text>
  <text start="776.24" dur="3.539">have anybody do it because I don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="778.459" dur="2.641">if there was fear that it was gonna the</text>
  <text start="779.779" dur="4.081">devil is gonna get in or what the deal</text>
  <text start="781.1" dur="4.62">was but it was very frustrating oh and</text>
  <text start="783.86" dur="5.46">and then I got kicked out of that church</text>
  <text start="785.72" dur="6.63">and then my wife and I started going to</text>
  <text start="789.32" dur="5.28">an Assemblies of God Church first time</text>
  <text start="792.35" dur="4.109">and and Denise was excited she was like</text>
  <text start="794.6" dur="3.599">oh this is cool because this is the</text>
  <text start="796.459" dur="3.901">stuff I really want to want to learn</text>
  <text start="798.199" dur="3.841">about she had been wanting to learn how</text>
  <text start="800.36" dur="4.53">to speak in tongues for a long time and</text>
  <text start="802.04" dur="4.5">the first time we went to this church I</text>
  <text start="804.89" dur="2.759">was a little freaked out because I was</text>
  <text start="806.54" dur="3.539">not ready for that</text>
  <text start="807.649" dur="6.75">and there&amp;#39;s three women standing right</text>
  <text start="810.079" dur="7.111">behind me singing in tongues opening it</text>
  <text start="814.399" dur="5.401">I was like wow that is kind of cool it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="817.19" dur="6.42">a little creepy but it&amp;#39;s kind of cool</text>
  <text start="819.8" dur="5.61">and then and then we had prophets come</text>
  <text start="823.61" dur="3.18">in I remember my friend melody pash came</text>
  <text start="825.41" dur="3.779">in and she was prophesying over</text>
  <text start="826.79" dur="3.479">everybody and we&amp;#39;d pray for people and</text>
  <text start="829.189" dur="3.93">there&amp;#39;s people getting healed all the</text>
  <text start="830.269" dur="4.951">time and the Holy Spirit was manifesting</text>
  <text start="833.119" dur="5.101">the gifts like crazy every week and</text>
  <text start="835.22" dur="5.729">that&amp;#39;s that was exciting for me how did</text>
  <text start="838.22" dur="5.399">the Lord then give you those experiences</text>
  <text start="840.949" dur="5.341">if it wasn&amp;#39;t happening in the church</text>
  <text start="843.619" dur="4.111">that you were going to I got really</text>
  <text start="846.29" dur="3.329">excited and you know I was seeing</text>
  <text start="847.73" dur="4.74">preaching Jesus to everybody on the job</text>
  <text start="849.619" dur="5.28">and so I doing that you know I ran into</text>
  <text start="852.47" dur="4.469">other Christians and I didn&amp;#39;t even know</text>
  <text start="854.899" dur="4.081">about other types of Chris but everybody</text>
  <text start="856.939" dur="4.411">would I thought I only knew Baptists and</text>
  <text start="858.98" dur="4.349">Methodists oh yeah we were looking at</text>
  <text start="861.35" dur="7.739">the little fish bowl like everybody</text>
  <text start="863.329" dur="9.41">knows and yeah so there was a Bible</text>
  <text start="869.089" dur="6.69">study happening on the job behind us and</text>
  <text start="872.739" dur="4.72">the guy who to people who were running</text>
  <text start="875.779" dur="4.92">it happy to be here at the building with</text>
  <text start="877.459" dur="6.24">me but one of them was and they were and</text>
  <text start="880.699" dur="4.56">one he was a prophet and he&amp;#39;s the friend</text>
  <text start="883.699" dur="4.68">I told you about on the line</text>
  <text start="885.259" dur="5.211">he was thought people would go looking</text>
  <text start="888.379" dur="5.55">for things like a house or something and</text>
  <text start="890.47" dur="6.159">God would supernaturally move him</text>
  <text start="893.929" dur="4.291">spiritually to the place where they had</text>
  <text start="896.629" dur="3.75">been looking at the house and he would</text>
  <text start="898.22" dur="4.44">be prophesying to them look at the demon</text>
  <text start="900.379" dur="4.62">it faced but at the same time walking</text>
  <text start="902.66" dur="4.2">through the property they had looked at</text>
  <text start="904.999" dur="3.721">he would describe it in detail to them</text>
  <text start="906.86" dur="3.509">and say this is the house the Lord&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="908.72" dur="3.839">going to give you and with all of that</text>
  <text start="910.369" dur="5.76">confirmation you know they couldn&amp;#39;t help</text>
  <text start="912.559" dur="7.171">but believe and so that was my exposure</text>
  <text start="916.129" dur="6.841">to prophet the prophetic so you ran into</text>
  <text start="919.73" dur="5.519">a heavy hitter in this Bible study then</text>
  <text start="922.97" dur="6.419">this guy was the real deal yeah he was</text>
  <text start="925.249" dur="8.28">he was the real deal and then he left</text>
  <text start="929.389" dur="8.55">and a guy took over the Bible study who</text>
  <text start="933.529" dur="6.96">began to I called him a mentor but he</text>
  <text start="937.939" dur="5.25">was the kind of mentor that he never</text>
  <text start="940.489" dur="3.9">would tell you what God was saying now</text>
  <text start="943.189" dur="3.81">when you were around him you were</text>
  <text start="944.389" dur="5.67">nervous because you know he do all of</text>
  <text start="946.999" dur="6.78">your business you like God holds back no</text>
  <text start="950.059" dur="6.301">secrets about this you know about you</text>
  <text start="953.779" dur="4.441">like from this guy but no matter how</text>
  <text start="956.36" dur="3.779">much he knew he would not tell you what</text>
  <text start="958.22" dur="3.869">God was saying so the way he mentored</text>
  <text start="960.139" dur="3.87">everybody was he would make you go back</text>
  <text start="962.089" dur="3.901">find out what God was saying to you so</text>
  <text start="964.009" dur="5.101">we would say brother James can you know</text>
  <text start="965.99" dur="6">I&amp;#39;m having this issue he what he was</text>
  <text start="969.11" dur="4.38">like well what did the Lord say hey why</text>
  <text start="971.99" dur="4.74">don&amp;#39;t you tell me what the Lord said</text>
  <text start="973.49" dur="6.029">well you told me what the Lord said they</text>
  <text start="976.73" dur="5.099">always did what he always do that</text>
  <text start="979.519" dur="4.5">you see that&amp;#39;s that I think personally I</text>
  <text start="981.829" dur="4.95">think that is I think that&amp;#39;s a brilliant</text>
  <text start="984.019" dur="4.26">way to to mentor people I actually</text>
  <text start="986.779" dur="3.87">posted a little thing on Facebook this</text>
  <text start="988.279" dur="3.99">morning a good teacher shows you where</text>
  <text start="990.649" dur="5.971">to look but doesn&amp;#39;t tell you what to see</text>
  <text start="992.269" dur="7.19">right so a good mentor says look go to</text>
  <text start="996.62" dur="5.37">the scriptures and look for this and</text>
  <text start="999.459" dur="4.6">this is what the Lord wants you to know</text>
  <text start="1001.99" dur="4.259">about but you need to find the</text>
  <text start="1004.059" dur="4.171">revelation yourself I get people who</text>
  <text start="1006.249" dur="3.69">come to me you know what is the Lord</text>
  <text start="1008.23" dur="3.87">saying about my life and I&amp;#39;m like well</text>
  <text start="1009.939" dur="3.541">have you asked the Holy Spirit what he</text>
  <text start="1012.1" dur="2.489">wants to tell you and they&amp;#39;re like well</text>
  <text start="1013.48" dur="3.75">I don&amp;#39;t really hear the voice of God</text>
  <text start="1014.589" dur="5.31">very well I&amp;#39;m like that&amp;#39;s a problem the</text>
  <text start="1017.23" dur="5.279">problem because you can&amp;#39;t really you</text>
  <text start="1019.899" dur="4.8">shouldn&amp;#39;t live your life expecting the</text>
  <text start="1022.509" dur="3.54">man of God or the woman of God to tell</text>
  <text start="1024.699" dur="2.911">you everything the Lord is saying about</text>
  <text start="1026.049" dur="4.051">your life you have to eventually learn</text>
  <text start="1027.61" dur="5.939">how to do it yourself right and I always</text>
  <text start="1030.1" dur="5.13">say if you don&amp;#39;t know when God is</text>
  <text start="1033.549" dur="3.331">speaking to you you still don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="1035.23" dur="3.809">when God is speaking to you whether he</text>
  <text start="1036.88" dur="4.319">uses a person a dream a vision</text>
  <text start="1039.039" dur="4.62">it&amp;#39;s very requires some discernment to</text>
  <text start="1041.199" dur="5.551">figure out is this God talking to me</text>
  <text start="1043.659" dur="4.831">could be anybody talking to you right</text>
  <text start="1046.75" dur="5.19">and so I always try to point them back</text>
  <text start="1048.49" dur="4.74">to let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s get to the root is maybe</text>
  <text start="1051.94" dur="3.33">we need to sit down and let&amp;#39;s figure out</text>
  <text start="1053.23" dur="4.13">how you can hear God cuz you&amp;#39;re hearing</text>
  <text start="1055.27" dur="4.71">us and that&amp;#39;s the thing you notice to</text>
  <text start="1057.36" dur="5.89">everybody here they just may not</text>
  <text start="1059.98" dur="5.97">recognize the voice of God yes for those</text>
  <text start="1063.25" dur="4.95">of you who&amp;#39;ve read my book hearing God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1065.95" dur="5.449">voice made simple I&amp;#39;m just going to tell</text>
  <text start="1068.2" dur="6.57">you straight up I am not nearly as</text>
  <text start="1071.399" dur="6.611">gifted or as developed in my gift of</text>
  <text start="1074.77" dur="6">hearing God as Kevin is and if you think</text>
  <text start="1078.01" dur="5.52">my book is a good book read Kevin&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1080.77" dur="5.22">books because you&amp;#39;re going to learn a</text>
  <text start="1083.53" dur="4.12">lot more about actually hearing God in</text>
  <text start="1085.99" dur="4.09">his books then you will</text>
  <text start="1087.65" dur="5.16">in mine my books are very broad like I</text>
  <text start="1090.08" dur="4.32">talk about how God speaks to art how God</text>
  <text start="1092.81" dur="4.02">speaks through music how he speaks</text>
  <text start="1094.4" dur="4.62">through film things of that nature but I</text>
  <text start="1096.83" dur="5.37">don&amp;#39;t go very much in depth on the</text>
  <text start="1099.02" dur="4.29">actual relational aspects of connecting</text>
  <text start="1102.2" dur="2.67">with the Holy Spirit getting</text>
  <text start="1103.31" dur="2.73">confirmation getting verification of</text>
  <text start="1104.87" dur="3.93">what you&amp;#39;re hearing all that stuff</text>
  <text start="1106.04" dur="5.49">you&amp;#39;re teaching is really really good on</text>
  <text start="1108.8" dur="6.03">those aspects you know what that came</text>
  <text start="1111.53" dur="5.64">from that same prophet that God first</text>
  <text start="1114.83" dur="4.92">introduced me now he was helping me</text>
  <text start="1117.17" dur="4.95">learn at one point and here we are in</text>
  <text start="1119.75" dur="3.81">the Bible study we&amp;#39;re all watching we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1122.12" dur="3.87">all in all of him because he&amp;#39;s operating</text>
  <text start="1123.56" dur="4.52">you know I had never seen it before and</text>
  <text start="1125.99" dur="4.26">this Bible study had people that were</text>
  <text start="1128.08" dur="4.36">charismatic and Protestants or somebody</text>
  <text start="1130.25" dur="5.97">else was just as new to this is me okay</text>
  <text start="1132.44" dur="4.86">and then God you know I&amp;#39;m seeking God in</text>
  <text start="1136.22" dur="3.69">my prayer time and I&amp;#39;m having</text>
  <text start="1137.3" dur="5.28">experiences and I started hearing God</text>
  <text start="1139.91" dur="4.71">clearly and so I come back to the Bible</text>
  <text start="1142.58" dur="5.79">saying now I&amp;#39;m sharing things for the</text>
  <text start="1144.62" dur="7.14">attention is just because he was sharing</text>
  <text start="1148.37" dur="4.95">things that were you know like prophecy</text>
  <text start="1151.76" dur="3.66">is really like a sign so you know you</text>
  <text start="1153.32" dur="5.91">you&amp;#39;re preaching then the signs of</text>
  <text start="1155.42" dur="6">follow and so he was using his signs as</text>
  <text start="1159.23" dur="4.65">his lead and God was giving me</text>
  <text start="1161.42" dur="3.87">revelation on things for how to live and</text>
  <text start="1163.88" dur="3.78">it was always somebody in the room for</text>
  <text start="1165.29" dur="4.83">saying hey that that was for me I was</text>
  <text start="1167.66" dur="4.05">just studying that this morning and so</text>
  <text start="1170.12" dur="3.33">then I started having my own visions and</text>
  <text start="1171.71" dur="4.32">dreams and I don&amp;#39;t know if he got</text>
  <text start="1173.45" dur="5.31">jealous or what it was but he started</text>
  <text start="1176.03" dur="4.95">treating me differently and one day I</text>
  <text start="1178.76" dur="4.2">was joking with him about some strange</text>
  <text start="1180.98" dur="4.47">thing I heard and I know it was the</text>
  <text start="1182.96" dur="4.68">enemy and he turned to me with a sharp</text>
  <text start="1185.45" dur="4.29">finger and he turned to me and just</text>
  <text start="1187.64" dur="4.38">pointed at me real harsh leaves it you</text>
  <text start="1189.74" dur="6.54">need to watch who you&amp;#39;re listening to</text>
  <text start="1192.02" dur="6.51">and that day began the rest of my life</text>
  <text start="1196.28" dur="4.05">because from that point forward I</text>
  <text start="1198.53" dur="3.42">struggled with doubt I mean I really</text>
  <text start="1200.33" dur="3.75">struggled with it that&amp;#39;s where the</text>
  <text start="1201.95" dur="3.96">booktitle custom is this God me or the</text>
  <text start="1204.08" dur="4.77">devil God is writing me on the devil I</text>
  <text start="1205.91" dur="5.4">read that in the intro to the book now</text>
  <text start="1208.85" dur="5.19">what I&amp;#39;m what I would like to know about</text>
  <text start="1211.31" dur="6.24">that particular instance was do you</text>
  <text start="1214.04" dur="6.06">think that that was him trying to sow</text>
  <text start="1217.55" dur="4.02">seeds of doubt or was he actually</text>
  <text start="1220.1" dur="3.3">discerning that you were hearing</text>
  <text start="1221.57" dur="4.8">devil and you weren&amp;#39;t hearing God</text>
  <text start="1223.4" dur="6.18">correctly I think it was a little bit of</text>
  <text start="1226.37" dur="5.97">both because he knew that I was hearing</text>
  <text start="1229.58" dur="5.25">correctly but it was the way he said it</text>
  <text start="1232.34" dur="5.82">it wasn&amp;#39;t loving it wasn&amp;#39;t you know you</text>
  <text start="1234.83" dur="4.98">can identify God by the expression and</text>
  <text start="1238.16" dur="3.54">so it wasn&amp;#39;t loving and then things</text>
  <text start="1239.81" dur="3.54">after that he would always harass me</text>
  <text start="1241.7" dur="4.65">like he would say he couldn&amp;#39;t leave his</text>
  <text start="1243.35" dur="4.59">job because I was holding them back so I</text>
  <text start="1246.35" dur="3.24">didn&amp;#39;t get to the place he went he was</text>
  <text start="1247.94" dur="5.31">doing study start doing so I had those</text>
  <text start="1249.59" dur="6.54">crazy prophetic prayed the prophetic</text>
  <text start="1253.25" dur="5.55">experiences with him where he became</text>
  <text start="1256.13" dur="4.74">tried to be a domineering prophet so I</text>
  <text start="1258.8" dur="3.84">know about that where you had it there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1260.87" dur="3.84">one to think they are you know your</text>
  <text start="1262.64" dur="4.77">end-all be-all and you can&amp;#39;t do anything</text>
  <text start="1264.71" dur="4.92">without and that&amp;#39;s unfortunate because I</text>
  <text start="1267.41" dur="5.19">mean you and I both know one of the big</text>
  <text start="1269.63" dur="5.94">issues in church leadership right now is</text>
  <text start="1272.6" dur="4.86">control mmm people want to be in control</text>
  <text start="1275.57" dur="2.88">they want to have the center of</text>
  <text start="1277.46" dur="3.63">attention they want to be on the</text>
  <text start="1278.45" dur="4.59">platform and a lot of leaders are really</text>
  <text start="1281.09" dur="4.68">interested in sort of micromanaging</text>
  <text start="1283.04" dur="5.76">people&amp;#39;s life yes they really are and</text>
  <text start="1285.77" dur="6">when you run into a gifted leader who is</text>
  <text start="1288.8" dur="6.06">like that it&amp;#39;s unfortunate so you must</text>
  <text start="1291.77" dur="5.7">have had a short term relationship with</text>
  <text start="1294.86" dur="5.1">this prophet then because things started</text>
  <text start="1297.47" dur="4.41">to deteriorate it sounds like it started</text>
  <text start="1299.96" dur="4.34">to go a little south but we always</text>
  <text start="1301.88" dur="4.95">remain friends because I was young and</text>
  <text start="1304.3" dur="5.74">impressed I was like 21 at the time so I</text>
  <text start="1306.83" dur="5.22">didn&amp;#39;t and he was like 49 or something</text>
  <text start="1310.04" dur="4.32">like this but when he finally left town</text>
  <text start="1312.05" dur="5.61">we left on good terms we did we never</text>
  <text start="1314.36" dur="5.07">allowed it to no I wasn&amp;#39;t going to let</text>
  <text start="1317.66" dur="3.09">it mess up my relationship with God and</text>
  <text start="1319.43" dur="2.91">he wasn&amp;#39;t gonna let it mess up but he</text>
  <text start="1320.75" dur="4.65">just he started to struggle with other</text>
  <text start="1322.34" dur="5.4">areas of his life and I got go into the</text>
  <text start="1325.4" dur="4.61">book later I talked about there was an</text>
  <text start="1327.74" dur="4.89">experience where we&amp;#39;re praying and I see</text>
  <text start="1330.01" dur="5.08">demons on the counter and God shows me</text>
  <text start="1332.63" dur="4.08">who they&amp;#39;re gonna start with 1st 2nd and</text>
  <text start="1335.09" dur="3.66">3rd and how they go to open doors for</text>
  <text start="1336.71" dur="5.1">each one and as I taught me about</text>
  <text start="1338.75" dur="5.61">warfare and how they strategize and so</text>
  <text start="1341.81" dur="5.7">the first thing they did was they opened</text>
  <text start="1344.36" dur="5.82">the door to a woman who started less</text>
  <text start="1347.51" dur="5.07">than for him and so that kind of messed</text>
  <text start="1350.18" dur="5.16">up our relationship too because the</text>
  <text start="1352.58" dur="5.25">woman started lusting for him</text>
  <text start="1355.34" dur="5.88">he didn&amp;#39;t fall into sin with her but he</text>
  <text start="1357.83" dur="6.06">didn&amp;#39;t he didn&amp;#39;t you reject her advances</text>
  <text start="1361.22" dur="4.83">and it led to a lot of gossip and you</text>
  <text start="1363.89" dur="4.59">know who headed over too far and he let</text>
  <text start="1366.05" dur="4.8">it go and it was actually the cause the</text>
  <text start="1368.48" dur="6.36">Bible study went from 20 people to about</text>
  <text start="1370.85" dur="6.81">5 because of that event and eventually</text>
  <text start="1374.84" dur="5.19">there was no Bible study so so the enemy</text>
  <text start="1377.66" dur="4.2">kind of got what he wanted which was</text>
  <text start="1380.03" dur="3.9">what he wanted to shut that Bible study</text>
  <text start="1381.86" dur="4.29">down he got what he wanted</text>
  <text start="1383.93" dur="4.98">yeah yeah what he wanted that was a say</text>
  <text start="1386.15" dur="4.2">it day it was a good day for my mentor</text>
  <text start="1388.91" dur="3.3">because my mentor picked up with it and</text>
  <text start="1390.35" dur="5.4">then I branched off I started my own</text>
  <text start="1392.21" dur="8.76">Bible study so the enemy didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1395.75" dur="7.74">completely get way sometimes you cut</text>
  <text start="1400.97" dur="5.72">down a tree and then the apples fall and</text>
  <text start="1403.49" dur="5.46">they spread seeds and more trees grow up</text>
  <text start="1406.69" dur="4.81">he didn&amp;#39;t get everything he wanted</text>
  <text start="1408.95" dur="6.12">that&amp;#39;s cool but we ended on to the terms</text>
  <text start="1411.5" dur="6.84">yeah you believe everyone can hear God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1415.07" dur="5.19">voice I believe everyone I&amp;#39;m certain</text>
  <text start="1418.34" dur="4.59">that everyone can hear God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="1420.26" dur="6.27">we all have spiritual senses like we all</text>
  <text start="1422.93" dur="6.48">have physical ears that hear we have</text>
  <text start="1426.53" dur="5.67">spiritual ears that hear we have</text>
  <text start="1429.41" dur="5.07">physical eyes we have spiritual eyes you</text>
  <text start="1432.2" dur="4.47">know what God has taught me is you know</text>
  <text start="1434.48" dur="4.08">we&amp;#39;re hearing and seeing things all the</text>
  <text start="1436.67" dur="5.22">time but people don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1438.56" dur="5.94">happening and so one of the main</text>
  <text start="1441.89" dur="3.96">receptors and what he didn&amp;#39;t last couple</text>
  <text start="1444.5" dur="3.06">of years he&amp;#39;s really been just dealing</text>
  <text start="1445.85" dur="4.02">with me more about the mind more about</text>
  <text start="1447.56" dur="3.93">the mind and pay attention to your mind</text>
  <text start="1449.87" dur="5.22">and imagination and things that are</text>
  <text start="1451.49" dur="6.27">happening there but people here hear</text>
  <text start="1455.09" dur="5.25">things all the time but they just don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1457.76" dur="3.87">realize what they&amp;#39;re listening to and so</text>
  <text start="1460.34" dur="2.57">that&amp;#39;s why I talk about like I have a</text>
  <text start="1461.63" dur="3.66">chapter in that but where I talk about</text>
  <text start="1462.91" dur="4.17">about the mind and its role and how it</text>
  <text start="1465.29" dur="6.12">relates to the spirit and in the whole</text>
  <text start="1467.08" dur="6.04">Conine because people always hear I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1471.41" dur="3.48">never forget business wonder ways God</text>
  <text start="1473.12" dur="4.35">really taught me how to pay attention</text>
  <text start="1474.89" dur="5.73">his there I struggled with</text>
  <text start="1477.47" dur="4.5">procrastination on the job and it was</text>
  <text start="1480.62" dur="3.75">getting on my nerves cuz I wanted to</text>
  <text start="1481.97" dur="5.67">overcoming like number one the job was</text>
  <text start="1484.37" dur="5.22">born and that was all I was a file clerk</text>

  <text start="1496.7" dur="4.95">hard time with this dis procrastination</text>
  <text start="1498.86" dur="5.91">and he said next time it happens I want</text>
  <text start="1501.65" dur="7.29">you to be quiet and just listen to your</text>
  <text start="1504.77" dur="5.7">thoughts and so I said okay so I&amp;#39;m</text>

  <text start="1539.57" dur="3.93">ignore this is this is the main way to</text>
  <text start="1541.94" dur="3.96">enemy gets a lot of people so they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1543.5" dur="4.08">hearing all the time and the way you</text>
  <text start="1545.9" dur="3.21">increase the volume in I hear it is all</text>
  <text start="1547.58" dur="4.44">you got to do is pay attention to it and</text>
  <text start="1549.11" dur="4.71">the volume increases right exactly now</text>
  <text start="1552.02" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;re getting it to the beat of hearing</text>
  <text start="1553.82" dur="5.52">those spiritual voices whichever voice</text>
  <text start="1556.88" dur="4.56">you pay attention to there&amp;#39;s like a</text>
  <text start="1559.34" dur="3.81">little volume knob that turns it up or</text>
  <text start="1561.44" dur="4.65">or or turns it down if you don&amp;#39;t pay</text>
  <text start="1563.15" dur="4.38">attention to it yeah yeah so people are</text>
  <text start="1566.09" dur="2.7">hearing and that&amp;#39;s what I try to help</text>
  <text start="1567.53" dur="4.59">people understand that&amp;#39;s what I deal</text>
  <text start="1568.79" dur="6.06">with warfare they&amp;#39;re hearing all the</text>
  <text start="1572.12" dur="4.38">time they just don&amp;#39;t know who they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="1574.85" dur="3.63">hearing so that&amp;#39;s why I focus a lot on</text>
  <text start="1576.5" dur="4.14">discernment but once you started to turn</text>
  <text start="1578.48" dur="5.19">them you can hear him giving him clearly</text>

  <text start="1597.74" dur="5.46">everywhere they&amp;#39;re like I&amp;#39;ve come to the</text>
  <text start="1599.99" dur="7.52">place now it is absolutely natural that</text>
  <text start="1603.2" dur="8.61">all of these other beings are around</text>
  <text start="1607.51" dur="7.6">dude if people could actually see in the</text>
  <text start="1611.81" dur="5.28">spirit of the angels and demons that are</text>
  <text start="1615.11" dur="4.95">walking around it&amp;#39;s like superimposing</text>

  <text start="1634.549" dur="4.5">beings are doing this stuff and like</text>
  <text start="1636.47" dur="5.1">when you hear those little voices like</text>

  <text start="1651.32" dur="4.949">yeah you might think that but we never</text>
  <text start="1654.44" dur="4.26">put it together that I&amp;#39;m hearing</text>
  <text start="1656.269" dur="6.54">somebody else and so I other thing I</text>

  <text start="1662.809" dur="2.701">give us a spirit of fear but of love</text>
  <text start="1663.98" dur="3.24">power in the sound man so I looked up</text>
  <text start="1665.51" dur="3.99">style my cuz I&amp;#39;ve all these years I</text>
  <text start="1667.22" dur="5.579">always thought it was me I have a I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1669.5" dur="7.169">not crazy for the Greek word means the</text>
  <text start="1672.799" dur="5.85">sound mind me self-control with me</text>
  <text start="1676.669" dur="4.74">there&amp;#39;s a relief between controlling</text>
  <text start="1678.649" dur="4.801">yourself in your mind and so once I</text>
  <text start="1681.409" dur="4.02">begin to understand that I started being</text>
  <text start="1683.45" dur="3.9">less I have control of myself that</text>
  <text start="1685.429" dur="3.48">includes my thoughts the thoughts that I</text>
  <text start="1687.35" dur="3.72">can&amp;#39;t control those and have my thoughts</text>
  <text start="1688.909" dur="5.311">and you know when you hear from God it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1691.07" dur="5.25">the same way okay so this is the</text>
  <text start="1694.22" dur="4.98">question people ask me all the time how</text>
  <text start="1696.32" dur="5.099">do I know if it&amp;#39;s the devil or if it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1699.2" dur="4.979">God or if it&amp;#39;s me and I&amp;#39;m saying like</text>
  <text start="1701.419" dur="6.961">what you said there you have self</text>
  <text start="1704.179" dur="5.941">control your mind will and emotions and</text>
  <text start="1708.38" dur="4.23">your thoughts you have control over</text>
  <text start="1710.12" dur="4.679">those things sometimes we don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1712.61" dur="3.84">understand like we have this thought and</text>
  <text start="1714.799" dur="3.151">go well did that come from some</text>
  <text start="1716.45" dur="4.53">somewhere outside of me or was it my own</text>
  <text start="1717.95" dur="5.939">thought well like you said if you have</text>
  <text start="1720.98" dur="5.85">control over it it&amp;#39;s an internal thought</text>

  <text start="1845.87" dur="4.8">the Lord was going to speak to me about</text>
  <text start="1847.82" dur="7.08">politics I was going to be open to those</text>

  <text start="1854.9" dur="4.86">speaking to me about politics it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1857.87" dur="4.44">getting irritating to some of my friends</text>
  <text start="1859.76" dur="5.01">probably but but the thing is he keeps</text>
  <text start="1862.31" dur="3.75">on speaking and I said look I&amp;#39;ll be open</text>
  <text start="1864.77" dur="3.78">to this discussion if you want to have</text>
  <text start="1866.06" dur="3.99">it and he said okay well yes I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="1868.55" dur="4.62">interested in having this discussion so</text>
  <text start="1870.05" dur="4.86">if you allow yourself to be open to</text>
  <text start="1873.17" dur="3.63">either what the demons want to talk</text>
  <text start="1874.91" dur="3.39">about or what God wants to talk about</text>
  <text start="1876.8" dur="3.99">you&amp;#39;re gonna start hearing those</text>
  <text start="1878.3" dur="4.41">subjects talked about you know if you</text>

  <text start="1889.43" dur="3.87">door that says hey come on</text>
  <text start="1890.78" dur="4.44">let&amp;#39;s have a conversation because I try</text>
  <text start="1893.3" dur="3.48">to tell people the principle of the</text>
  <text start="1895.22" dur="3">spirit around are the principle there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1896.78" dur="4.14">a spirit so real I think one of the</text>
  <text start="1898.22" dur="5.49">mistakes the church speaks is they say</text>
  <text start="1900.92" dur="4.44">well this is God and this is the devil</text>
  <text start="1903.71" dur="3.96">and devil would do it that way but he</text>
  <text start="1905.36" dur="4.7">but he does they&amp;#39;re just principles are</text>
  <text start="1907.67" dur="6.18">the principles of the spiritual realm</text>
  <text start="1910.06" dur="5.98">exactly why you can hear anything you</text>
  <text start="1913.85" dur="3.63">think why you anything you give any one</text>
  <text start="1916.04" dur="3.48">of them your attention you&amp;#39;re gonna hear</text>
  <text start="1917.48" dur="4.47">and it&amp;#39;ll be clear just like any other</text>
  <text start="1919.52" dur="9.45">boys they&amp;#39;ll curse you out who oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1921.95" dur="10.11">not all right so do you believe that for</text>
  <text start="1928.97" dur="5.31">most people learning to hear God&amp;#39;s voice</text>
  <text start="1932.06" dur="5.79">is like an immediate thing that happens</text>
  <text start="1934.28" dur="5.85">or is it a process I think learning to</text>
  <text start="1937.85" dur="4.83">hear is immediate I think learning to</text>
  <text start="1940.13" dur="6.32">discern is the process okay I think</text>
  <text start="1942.68" dur="6.39">that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where most people struggle</text>
  <text start="1946.45" dur="5.53">because it takes it takes time to become</text>
  <text start="1949.07" dur="5.73">confident I tell people God is a person</text>
  <text start="1951.98" dur="4.35">just like you and even though it seems</text>
  <text start="1954.8" dur="2.7">like just because God says something</text>
  <text start="1956.33" dur="3.18">you&amp;#39;re going to trust him</text>
  <text start="1957.5" dur="3.84">you you really don&amp;#39;t you have to learn</text>
  <text start="1959.51" dur="4.11">how to trust God and that&amp;#39;s something</text>
  <text start="1961.34" dur="4.56">that Trust has to be earned in every</text>
  <text start="1963.62" dur="4.11">relationship even with him and people</text>
  <text start="1965.9" dur="4.02">don&amp;#39;t like that but you could look at</text>
  <text start="1967.73" dur="4.41">Israel coming out part of the problem</text>
  <text start="1969.92" dur="3.15">was for 400 years they&amp;#39;ve known the</text>
  <text start="1972.14" dur="3.42">Egyptian gods</text>
  <text start="1973.07" dur="4.26">now here comes this new God sure he does</text>
  <text start="1975.56" dur="3.75">something greater than what they&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="1977.33" dur="3.35">in Egypt you know they had they had fire</text>
  <text start="1979.31" dur="4.74">because you started to turn the sticks</text>
  <text start="1980.68" dur="5.29">to surface so they did not born the</text>
  <text start="1984.05" dur="4.59">power they were therefore into this</text>
  <text start="1985.97" dur="4.02">power and they&amp;#39;re not sure they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="1988.64" dur="2.79">trust you and you can see that all</text>
  <text start="1989.99" dur="3.48">throughout where they just don&amp;#39;t trust</text>
  <text start="1991.43" dur="5.43">them and they keep looking back to the</text>
  <text start="1993.47" dur="5.52">old God so and it&amp;#39;s the same with God</text>
  <text start="1996.86" dur="4.5">you have to learn how to trust him I&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="1998.99" dur="5.1">never get he spoke to me in an audible</text>
  <text start="2001.36" dur="4.23">voice I mean really clear loud audible</text>
  <text start="2004.09" dur="5.16">voice and said tomorrow they&amp;#39;re gonna</text>
  <text start="2005.59" dur="8.55">offer you job don&amp;#39;t turn it down so the</text>
  <text start="2009.25" dur="7.65">next day guess what I did we&amp;#39;re good I</text>
  <text start="2014.14" dur="4.56">guess see it look at the head come to in</text>
  <text start="2016.9" dur="4.77">my to a place of I&amp;#39;m with you and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2018.7" dur="4.29">trusting God yet that&amp;#39;s interesting you</text>
  <text start="2021.67" dur="2.999">know when you look at the Ministry of</text>
  <text start="2022.99" dur="4.919">Jesus</text>
  <text start="2024.669" dur="5.94">so he&amp;#39;s chooses the 12 disciples and</text>
  <text start="2027.909" dur="4.08">he&amp;#39;s doing ministry with them and man</text>
  <text start="2030.609" dur="4.14">they&amp;#39;re having some trust issues with</text>
  <text start="2031.989" dur="4.32">him yeah because he&amp;#39;s teaching some</text>
  <text start="2034.749" dur="3.39">pretty heavy-duty things things they</text>
  <text start="2036.309" dur="3.75">didn&amp;#39;t want to hear he&amp;#39;s telling that</text>
  <text start="2038.139" dur="3.6">I&amp;#39;m gonna be crucified and they&amp;#39;re they</text>
  <text start="2040.059" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t wanna hear that and they&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2041.739" dur="4.26">struggling with this issue of man should</text>
  <text start="2044.259" dur="5.64">we trust this guy or not he sometimes he</text>
  <text start="2045.999" dur="5.34">seems a little flaky enough Peter denies</text>
  <text start="2049.899" dur="2.611">him mm-hmm</text>
  <text start="2051.339" dur="2.82">I mean there was some serious trust</text>
  <text start="2052.51" dur="5.43">issues happen three years of being with</text>
  <text start="2054.159" dur="5.311">them right yeah people I think people</text>
  <text start="2057.94" dur="3.09">need to understand that it&amp;#39;s natural to</text>
  <text start="2059.47" dur="4.619">have trust issues with God when I was</text>
  <text start="2061.03" dur="5.069">first started having dreams the Lord was</text>
  <text start="2064.089" dur="3.421">showing me dreams about me doing some</text>
  <text start="2066.099" dur="5.55">things that I was kind of uncomfortable</text>
  <text start="2067.51" dur="8.43">with like prophetic crime-solving</text>
  <text start="2071.649" dur="7.081">he was showing me addresses of murder</text>
  <text start="2075.94" dur="4.59">scenes dead bodies he want to give me</text>
  <text start="2078.73" dur="4.649">names and addresses of people who</text>
  <text start="2080.53" dur="5.069">actually committed the murders like cold</text>
  <text start="2083.379" dur="3.99">cases that were unsolved he was</text>
  <text start="2085.599" dur="3.361">suggesting to me that he would give me</text>
  <text start="2087.369" dur="3.661">the information and I could go to the</text>
  <text start="2088.96" dur="7.22">police and with that information I was</text>
  <text start="2091.03" dur="8.039">like okay yeah I&amp;#39;m not really into that</text>
  <text start="2096.18" dur="6.369">so I pretty much asked him for another</text>
  <text start="2099.069" dur="6.061">assignment because I didn&amp;#39;t trust that</text>
  <text start="2102.549" dur="4.201">he could keep me safe and make that a</text>
  <text start="2105.13" dur="4.14">situation that wouldn&amp;#39;t blow up in my</text>
  <text start="2106.75" dur="4.14">face because you know you start giving</text>
  <text start="2109.27" dur="3.36">that information to federal prosecutors</text>
  <text start="2110.89" dur="5.54">and the next thing they&amp;#39;re gonna wanna</text>
  <text start="2112.63" dur="6.63">know is hiding all this information oh</text>
  <text start="2116.43" dur="6.909">yeah and now you&amp;#39;re a suspect instead of</text>
  <text start="2119.26" dur="6.45">the informant so yeah but is it is a</text>
  <text start="2123.339" dur="4.411">process of trust it&amp;#39;s I think it is</text>
  <text start="2125.71" dur="5.31">natural not to always trust what God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2127.75" dur="7.799">doing or saying you brought up something</text>
  <text start="2131.02" dur="7.47">the other day about whether demons have</text>
  <text start="2135.549" dur="5.131">access to information regarding the</text>
  <text start="2138.49" dur="5.16">future there&amp;#39;s a lot of Christians are</text>
  <text start="2140.68" dur="4.95">under the impression that only God is</text>
  <text start="2143.65" dur="3.77">omniscient and in order for you to see</text>
  <text start="2145.63" dur="6.51">the future you have to be omniscient</text>
  <text start="2147.42" dur="6.909">mmm-hmm but but the thing is God&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2152.14" dur="5.25">omniscience means he knows the outcomes</text>
  <text start="2154.329" dur="4.201">and events of all things but the Bible</text>
  <text start="2157.39" dur="3.15">also says he</text>
  <text start="2158.53" dur="5.49">his secrets to his servants the prophets</text>
  <text start="2160.54" dur="5.82">mmm we don&amp;#39;t have to be omniscient for</text>
  <text start="2164.02" dur="4.59">God to reveal his secrets to us all</text>
  <text start="2166.36" dur="3.87">right we just need we just have to have</text>
  <text start="2168.61" dur="2.67">access to the information the</text>
  <text start="2170.23" dur="3.57">information is out there</text>
  <text start="2171.28" dur="6.09">is the information of people&amp;#39;s futures</text>
  <text start="2173.8" dur="5.52">available to demons and angels as well</text>
  <text start="2177.37" dur="3.74">as us is that a spiritual principle or</text>
  <text start="2179.32" dur="4.47">is that only reveal to certain people I</text>
  <text start="2181.11" dur="4.39">think you know what if this is gospel</text>
  <text start="2183.79" dur="4.83">talking to me over the last couple of</text>
  <text start="2185.5" dur="5.34">days in detail about about sort of the</text>
  <text start="2188.62" dur="5.13">same subject one of the things he&amp;#39;s been</text>
  <text start="2190.84" dur="4.77">asking me talk to me for a long time for</text>
  <text start="2193.75" dur="4.89">years but you know sometimes you</text>
  <text start="2195.61" dur="4.83">struggle to embrace something what</text>
  <text start="2198.64" dur="3.81">people sometimes don&amp;#39;t understand is</text>
  <text start="2200.44" dur="4.83">that when God gives us the gifts he</text>
  <text start="2202.45" dur="5.58">gives he literally gives them to us and</text>
  <text start="2205.27" dur="3.87">they&amp;#39;re for us for our use and like if</text>
  <text start="2208.03" dur="3.03">you&amp;#39;re at the point in your healing</text>
  <text start="2209.14" dur="5.31">ministry now with you don&amp;#39;t need to be</text>
  <text start="2211.06" dur="5.07">led you can decide hey I&amp;#39;m gonna go over</text>
  <text start="2214.45" dur="3.81">there and ministers in his first and and</text>
  <text start="2216.13" dur="4.59">feel and then you have people like Bill</text>
  <text start="2218.26" dur="4.89">Heyman who had prophet bill Hammond</text>
  <text start="2220.72" dur="3.99">who&amp;#39;s been teaching people for years hey</text>
  <text start="2223.15" dur="3.18">these are your gifts these are your</text>
  <text start="2224.71" dur="3.63">gifts you have to use them so you run</text>

  <text start="2228.34" dur="4.56">God&amp;#39;s not using me that&amp;#39;s not the</text>
  <text start="2231.31" dur="3.42">problem you&amp;#39;re not using the gift</text>
  <text start="2232.9" dur="3.9">because he says let him who prophesize</text>

  <text start="2236.8" dur="4.59">the gift left who him who serves in</text>
  <text start="2238.57" dur="6.03">serving so he tells them so my point is</text>
  <text start="2241.39" dur="6.63">God gives us the gift the gift is the</text>
  <text start="2244.6" dur="6.54">ability to see like see the future so</text>

  <text start="2389.95" dur="4.14">use the gift and so you don&amp;#39;t see that</text>
  <text start="2392.17" dur="4.11">it&amp;#39;s not about to get it&amp;#39;s about the</text>
  <text start="2394.09" dur="5.1">influence and the motive behind the gift</text>
  <text start="2396.28" dur="5.07">and he&amp;#39;s been really saying that to me</text>
  <text start="2399.19" dur="4.98">Oh went over your reading and Saul</text>

  <text start="2408.85" dur="4.98">chapter later he&amp;#39;s looking for David he</text>
  <text start="2411.58" dur="3.81">runs into Samuel when he comes with the</text>
  <text start="2413.83" dur="3.48">Prophet he takes all his clothes off</text>
  <text start="2415.39" dur="4.17">naked if there&amp;#39;s an Holy Spirit comes</text>
  <text start="2417.31" dur="4.98">upon him and he prophesied and you can</text>
  <text start="2419.56" dur="5.34">go all through so if the problem is</text>
  <text start="2422.29" dur="4.019">never to give it&amp;#39;s the source who&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2424.9" dur="3.809">inspiring how you</text>
  <text start="2426.309" dur="4.89">to the gift how we use the gift because</text>
  <text start="2428.709" dur="4.59">I&amp;#39;ve seen at the same properties anyone</text>
  <text start="2431.199" dur="3.9">who introduced me to this one day we</text>
  <text start="2433.299" dur="3.72">were all in the basement he got it to</text>
  <text start="2435.099" dur="4.2">this place when he wanted to show off he</text>
  <text start="2437.019" dur="4.411">want to show off with his gear and the</text>
  <text start="2439.299" dur="3.96">first like 10 minutes he was of course</text>
  <text start="2441.43" dur="3.329">Wow and everybody it&amp;#39;s a whole bunch of</text>
  <text start="2443.259" dur="3.72">us prophetic people but he had this</text>
  <text start="2444.759" dur="4.68">strongest word of knowledge and so he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2446.979" dur="4.23">showing all and while he&amp;#39;s showing off</text>
  <text start="2449.439" dur="3.721">the president is of God lives because</text>
  <text start="2451.209" dur="5.221">he&amp;#39;s not operating from the right motive</text>
  <text start="2453.16" dur="5.25">at this point next we all get this knot</text>
  <text start="2456.43" dur="5.099">in our stomach cuz now he&amp;#39;s starting the</text>
  <text start="2458.41" dur="5.429">prophesy and we all know just something</text>
  <text start="2461.529" dur="4.351">ain&amp;#39;t right something ain&amp;#39;t right with</text>
  <text start="2463.839" dur="4.23">this and all of it but we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="2465.88" dur="4.29">what to do you know all of us anew</text>
  <text start="2468.069" dur="4.5">except for one during another prophet</text>
  <text start="2470.17" dur="4.679">who was there and so eventually he</text>
  <text start="2472.569" dur="6.15">starts rambling and he starts to like</text>
  <text start="2474.849" dur="5.88">almost lose to the mind and so so we had</text>
  <text start="2478.719" dur="4.921">to get it up a cast out of him a</text>
  <text start="2480.729" dur="6.54">familiar spirit that took advantage of</text>
  <text start="2483.64" dur="5.49">him using the wrong motives so the same</text>
  <text start="2487.269" dur="4.891">gift that he was using just a minute ago</text>
  <text start="2489.13" dur="5.189">just a minute before God was using the</text>
  <text start="2492.16" dur="5.309">gift a minute later something else was</text>
  <text start="2494.319" dur="5.43">using the deal so this you guys actually</text>
  <text start="2497.469" dur="5.64">had to cast out a familiar spirit from</text>
  <text start="2499.749" dur="5.01">him we had to cast it out my very first</text>
  <text start="2503.109" dur="4.11">time out we had to cast out the first</text>
  <text start="2504.759" dur="5.371">time I haven&amp;#39;t seen it that&amp;#39;s crazy I</text>
  <text start="2507.219" dur="4.411">would like to say I&amp;#39;ve never experienced</text>
  <text start="2510.13" dur="2.729">that kind of thing but I have</text>
  <text start="2511.63" dur="3.659">experienced that kind of thing we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2512.859" dur="5.37">very gifted prophetic people had the</text>
  <text start="2515.289" dur="4.74">wrong motive because they hand over had</text>
  <text start="2518.229" dur="4.191">the wrong motive and made them</text>
  <text start="2520.029" dur="5.43">susceptible to the different spirit and</text>
  <text start="2522.42" dur="5.23">it&amp;#39;s never good when that happens right</text>
  <text start="2525.459" dur="3.75">but their gifts was still operate and</text>
  <text start="2527.65" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s what throw people off because</text>
  <text start="2529.209" dur="5.52">they still see the gift opera I know a</text>
  <text start="2530.89" dur="7.379">lady a prophet told her you&amp;#39;re gonna be</text>
  <text start="2534.729" dur="5.401">my wife now she was already married but</text>
  <text start="2538.269" dur="5.28">she went with him anyway they got into</text>
  <text start="2540.13" dur="5.729">this illicit affair so it&amp;#39;s possible so</text>
  <text start="2543.549" dur="3.78">that&amp;#39;s why that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve my focus and</text>
  <text start="2545.859" dur="4.531">this is one of the things I love about</text>
  <text start="2547.329" dur="5.43">well God is he knows how to bring</text>
  <text start="2550.39" dur="4.26">pictures together I believe in community</text>
  <text start="2552.759" dur="4.68">I believe in partnering with people and</text>
  <text start="2554.65" dur="4.89">working with people because God gives</text>
  <text start="2557.439" dur="4.021">everybody apart</text>
  <text start="2559.54" dur="5.13">and one thing he said to be one day he</text>
  <text start="2561.46" dur="5.31">shows me a vision of us of a circle he</text>
  <text start="2564.67" dur="4.44">said this is what my people think ponens</text>
  <text start="2566.77" dur="3.81">looks like he said behold this really</text>
  <text start="2569.11" dur="3.48">looks like this to me and he shows me a</text>
  <text start="2570.58" dur="3.3">puzzle piece and what he pointed out to</text>
  <text start="2572.59" dur="3.72">you about the puzzle piece was there</text>
  <text start="2573.88" dur="4.55">were some parts that were obvious</text>
  <text start="2576.31" dur="4.47">strengths and other parts where you had</text>
  <text start="2578.43" dur="3.55">deficiencies you had weaknesses he said</text>
  <text start="2580.78" dur="2.82">this is where my strength is made</text>
  <text start="2581.98" dur="4.8">perfect in weakness he said but the</text>
  <text start="2583.6" dur="5.13">other reason that I make people this way</text>
  <text start="2586.78" dur="3.99">it&amp;#39;s so that they can partner with other</text>
  <text start="2588.73" dur="4.53">people and so you&amp;#39;ll see where people</text>
  <text start="2590.77" dur="5.46">have similar passions but slightly</text>
  <text start="2593.26" dur="5.22">different right so you&amp;#39;ll see my one of</text>
  <text start="2596.23" dur="4.44">my biggest things is discernment like I</text>
  <text start="2598.48" dur="3.84">can talk about discerning discernment</text>
  <text start="2600.67" dur="3.78">and I&amp;#39;ve wrestled with demons and fought</text>
  <text start="2602.32" dur="4.8">with demons and seen demons I&amp;#39;ve had</text>
  <text start="2604.45" dur="4.65">plenty of experiences with that and so</text>
  <text start="2607.12" dur="5.13">what God allows me to do is come</text>
  <text start="2609.1" dur="6.39">alongside and add my part and so that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2612.25" dur="7.23">why even with with your book I recommend</text>
  <text start="2615.49" dur="7.29">it your book mark vikas book my probe</text>
  <text start="2619.48" dur="5.91">and Lila&amp;#39;s book I&amp;#39;ve put those in the</text>
  <text start="2622.78" dur="5.19">back of my book as other resources</text>
  <text start="2625.39" dur="4.74">because I realized that everything God</text>
  <text start="2627.97" dur="3.09">gives them is meant to be a companion</text>
  <text start="2630.13" dur="3.33">into something else</text>
  <text start="2631.06" dur="4.2">and anytime people isolate their one</text>
  <text start="2633.46" dur="3.87">gift and they have one little</text>
  <text start="2635.26" dur="4.41">perspective and you see people they&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="2637.33" dur="5.7">they&amp;#39;ll try to be you know they&amp;#39;ll try</text>
  <text start="2639.67" dur="5.61">to dominate one section of of truth and</text>
  <text start="2643.03" dur="4.08">they won&amp;#39;t they&amp;#39;re not open anybody else</text>
  <text start="2645.28" dur="4.02">is true because they think that God has</text>
  <text start="2647.11" dur="3.69">given them everything I&amp;#39;d like to say</text>
  <text start="2649.3" dur="3.72">that doesn&amp;#39;t happen but it does happen</text>
  <text start="2650.8" dur="5.16">it&amp;#39;s you know whether it&amp;#39;s prophetic</text>
  <text start="2653.02" dur="5.7">teaching or healing there are some</text>
  <text start="2655.96" dur="4.68">ministers who want people to think they</text>
  <text start="2658.72" dur="3.78">have all the answers they&amp;#39;ve got it all</text>
  <text start="2660.64" dur="3.75">figured out you just need to take my</text>
  <text start="2662.5" dur="3.78">course take my lessons and don&amp;#39;t worry</text>
  <text start="2664.39" dur="3.36">about whatever yell sizz teaching you</text>
  <text start="2666.28" dur="7.02">know this is all you really need to know</text>
  <text start="2667.75" dur="7.17">and that is a dangerous agenda you know</text>
  <text start="2673.3" dur="3.57">the Lord gave me that one dream it was a</text>
  <text start="2674.92" dur="4.26">very powerful dream about how ministry</text>
  <text start="2676.87" dur="4.71">works like healing I had this dream</text>
  <text start="2679.18" dur="5.34">where I was way in the future and I was</text>
  <text start="2681.58" dur="5.73">working as a divine healer and I would</text>
  <text start="2684.52" dur="4.74">show up for work and I would literally</text>
  <text start="2687.31" dur="4.2">take out a file of somebody I was going</text>
  <text start="2689.26" dur="4.17">to pray for who needed healing the Lord</text>
  <text start="2691.51" dur="5.07">would show me certain things about them</text>
  <text start="2693.43" dur="5.49">in visions and I would pray as I was led</text>
  <text start="2696.58" dur="4.35">by the visions and my prayers would be</text>
  <text start="2698.92" dur="4.2">recorded and become a permanent part of</text>
  <text start="2700.93" dur="4.47">their record then they would go to</text>
  <text start="2703.12" dur="4.2">another person and receive prayer and</text>
  <text start="2705.4" dur="3.54">that person would pray in a completely</text>
  <text start="2707.32" dur="3.15">different way the prayers would be</text>
  <text start="2708.94" dur="3.21">recorded and become a part of their</text>
  <text start="2710.47" dur="4.67">record they would go to four different</text>
  <text start="2712.15" dur="5.22">people and when they were done with</text>
  <text start="2715.14" dur="3.67">receiving healing prayer from four</text>
  <text start="2717.37" dur="3.63">different people who prayed for</text>
  <text start="2718.81" dur="4.77">different ways they would be healed and</text>
  <text start="2721" dur="4.77">in the dream everybody was always healed</text>
  <text start="2723.58" dur="5.73">but they had to go to four different</text>
  <text start="2725.77" dur="6.12">people and all that symbolizes to me is</text>
  <text start="2729.31" dur="4.74">the idea that none of us have the whole</text>
  <text start="2731.89" dur="4.38">picture we&amp;#39;re just little pieces of the</text>
  <text start="2734.05" dur="4.29">puzzle and you know people come to me</text>
  <text start="2736.27" dur="4.62">and say well I can&amp;#39;t get healed and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2738.34" dur="6.03">thinking well you know it&amp;#39;s a complex</text>
  <text start="2740.89" dur="4.86">puzzle I didn&amp;#39;t I can maybe give you one</text>
  <text start="2744.37" dur="3.45">piece of the puzzle but you might need</text>
  <text start="2745.75" dur="3.9">to go to Steve Harmon for another piece</text>
  <text start="2747.82" dur="3.75">you might need to go to somebody else</text>
  <text start="2749.65" dur="5.55">for another piece and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2751.57" dur="5.07">process and it makes us value you know</text>
  <text start="2755.2" dur="3.44">one of the problems we have in the</text>
  <text start="2756.64" dur="4.83">church is people don&amp;#39;t value each other</text>
  <text start="2758.64" dur="4.66">because it&amp;#39;s hard to value somebody when</text>
  <text start="2761.47" dur="3.24">you think you&amp;#39;re a circle but when you</text>
  <text start="2763.3" dur="3.48">make when you know you look more like a</text>
  <text start="2764.71" dur="4.08">puzzle piece you have areas of weakness</text>
  <text start="2766.78" dur="3.87">it&amp;#39;s easy for you to allow other people</text>
  <text start="2768.79" dur="4.95">to come along who complement your</text>
  <text start="2770.65" dur="6.39">weaknesses and that&amp;#39;s what people really</text>
  <text start="2773.74" dur="6.03">struggle with so like I&amp;#39;m still a part</text>
  <text start="2777.04" dur="4.74">of the Evangelical Church then they&amp;#39;re a</text>
  <text start="2779.77" dur="3.66">little further along but they&amp;#39;re still</text>
  <text start="2781.78" dur="4.08">nice oh I was gonna say you know I was</text>
  <text start="2783.43" dur="3.99">gonna go to a charismatic church no I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="2785.86" dur="2.76">gonna go to the charismatic church and</text>
  <text start="2787.42" dur="3.6">God said no I want to stay right here</text>
  <text start="2788.62" dur="6.12">and then he shows you this vision of</text>
  <text start="2791.02" dur="7.11">this this these logs of fire and this</text>
  <text start="2794.74" dur="4.98">one low and he says somebody&amp;#39;s got to in</text>
  <text start="2798.13" dur="3.78">order to have a fire there has to be a</text>
  <text start="2799.72" dur="5.43">fire present those logs won&amp;#39;t catch fire</text>
  <text start="2801.91" dur="5.43">without a fire near them and said you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="2805.15" dur="4.77">the fire starter yeah I get to be the</text>
  <text start="2807.34" dur="4.29">guy to expose them to thing and it&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="2809.92" dur="3.36">little easier because they teach on it</text>
  <text start="2811.63" dur="3.42">at the church you just don&amp;#39;t see it and</text>
  <text start="2813.28" dur="3.93">so I at least get to help them see it</text>
  <text start="2815.05" dur="4.17">what they never you know would have</text>
  <text start="2817.21" dur="5.04">never seen and can go you know say get a</text>
  <text start="2819.22" dur="8.15">little fascinated with it and my wife is</text>
  <text start="2822.25" dur="5.12">like bye why don&amp;#39;t my wife they go crazy</text>
  <text start="2827.869" dur="5.97">and it is strange that God brought us</text>
  <text start="2831.079" dur="5.371">together cuz now my wife has her gifts</text>
  <text start="2833.839" dur="4.53">some of them operate but she&amp;#39;s not this</text>
  <text start="2836.45" dur="3.839">familiar with everything and when we got</text>
  <text start="2838.369" dur="3.48">married I was caught in a slump with my</text>
  <text start="2840.289" dur="4.08">I couldn&amp;#39;t see in the spirit as well I</text>
  <text start="2841.849" dur="4.68">would see if I didn&amp;#39;t want it to see but</text>
  <text start="2844.369" dur="3.69">I never really looked and so I told her</text>
  <text start="2846.529" dur="3.54">about it but she hadn&amp;#39;t really seen it</text>
  <text start="2848.059" dur="3.56">but she started seeing she thought I was</text>
  <text start="2850.069" dur="4.171">a little crazy</text>
  <text start="2851.619" dur="5.081">but to be she helps to balance me</text>
  <text start="2854.24" dur="4.17">because you know when you live in the</text>
  <text start="2856.7" dur="3.45">supernatural all the time you just look</text>
  <text start="2858.41" dur="4.169">at life from the supernatural point of</text>
  <text start="2860.15" dur="4.56">view like but if I want something I know</text>
  <text start="2862.579" dur="5.161">I could get it from God I know how to</text>
  <text start="2864.71" dur="5.369">use faith and get it from God and so for</text>
  <text start="2867.74" dur="5.039">a long time I wouldn&amp;#39;t buy any clothes I</text>
  <text start="2870.079" dur="4.681">would go in the same clothes until they</text>
  <text start="2872.779" dur="4.08">got worn out and then I would say God I</text>
  <text start="2874.76" dur="3.87">need clothes and he would show me things</text>
  <text start="2876.859" dur="3.69">like a blank check and send me to the</text>
  <text start="2878.63" dur="3.78">mall and let me go get all the stuff I</text>
  <text start="2880.549" dur="3.961">need and then I get back we get back to</text>
  <text start="2882.41" dur="4.08">the job I&amp;#39;d have know he would replenish</text>
  <text start="2884.51" dur="4.559">that clutch more so I can go shopping</text>
  <text start="2886.49" dur="5.069">again and I always live that way so I</text>
  <text start="2889.069" dur="5.911">have a lot of those kind of stories but</text>
  <text start="2891.559" dur="5.671">when I met my wife she said you know you</text>
  <text start="2894.98" dur="4.2">can take just a little bit of your money</text>
  <text start="2897.23" dur="3.9">every month and just get a shirt or a</text>
  <text start="2899.18" dur="3.119">tie or pay advance you don&amp;#39;t have to</text>
  <text start="2901.13" dur="2.189">wait till you have nothing and get</text>
  <text start="2902.299" dur="4.381">everything all at once</text>
  <text start="2903.319" dur="6.091">it never that&amp;#39;s funny but it never</text>
  <text start="2906.68" dur="5.339">dawned on me because I always lived on</text>
  <text start="2909.41" dur="5.97">mirrors and so I learned that God is</text>
  <text start="2912.019" dur="5.371">practical and super net and you&amp;#39;re right</text>
  <text start="2915.38" dur="3.629">but you know they but you know two days</text>
  <text start="2917.39" dur="5.129">because you had that evangelical</text>
  <text start="2919.009" dur="4.891">background to when you will you you run</text>
  <text start="2922.519" dur="2.881">into people you run into people who</text>
  <text start="2923.9" dur="5.189">don&amp;#39;t think they could ever go to the</text>
  <text start="2925.4" dur="5.879">doctor right on my face and then they</text>
  <text start="2929.089" dur="3.871">get sick and they won&amp;#39;t use medicine and</text>
  <text start="2931.279" dur="3.84">they won&amp;#39;t do things that you know they</text>
  <text start="2932.96" dur="4.02">won&amp;#39;t use common sense because well God</text>
  <text start="2935.119" dur="5.371">is all supernatural that&amp;#39;s just a point</text>
  <text start="2936.98" dur="5.369">of view you know so for me I listen to</text>
  <text start="2940.49" dur="3.99">faith things I&amp;#39;ve listened to</text>
  <text start="2942.349" dur="4.47">deliverance people I&amp;#39;ve listened to a</text>
  <text start="2944.48" dur="5.49">lot of different things to help me stay</text>
  <text start="2946.819" dur="5.371">round and experience God from you know</text>
  <text start="2949.97" dur="4.02">all of the different sides where I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="2952.19" dur="3.69">met people who don&amp;#39;t listen to anybody</text>
  <text start="2953.99" dur="4.109">there&amp;#39;s not charismatic well listen</text>
  <text start="2955.88" dur="3.419">anybody does not imagine cool they won&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="2958.099" dur="2.061">doesn&amp;#39;t say anybody that&amp;#39;s fabulous</text>
  <text start="2959.299" dur="2.941">anybody</text>
  <text start="2960.16" dur="5.02">because they didn&amp;#39;t got in their little</text>
  <text start="2962.24" dur="5.13">box and then when they need faith they</text>
  <text start="2965.18" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t have access to faith because they</text>
  <text start="2967.37" dur="3.36">haven&amp;#39;t been under teaching where God</text>
  <text start="2968.93" dur="5.79">can transform that part they understand</text>
  <text start="2970.73" dur="6.39">it and so I believe highly in the puzzle</text>
  <text start="2974.72" dur="5.61">pieces of the body of Christ</text>
  <text start="2977.12" dur="5.61">I just know I do too yeah I you know I</text>
  <text start="2980.33" dur="5.31">listen to a lot of of wide variety of</text>
  <text start="2982.73" dur="4.32">teaching because it&amp;#39;s to me it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2985.64" dur="4.02">interesting to get somebody else&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="2987.05" dur="4.11">perspective I love hearing testimonies</text>
  <text start="2989.66" dur="4.68">about how God does things differently</text>
  <text start="2991.16" dur="5.04">for different people like I remember</text>
  <text start="2994.34" dur="5.25">watching this youtube video which was a</text>
  <text start="2996.2" dur="6.87">testimony of this guy who he had cancer</text>
  <text start="2999.59" dur="5.91">and the cancer was in his chest and it</text>
  <text start="3003.07" dur="5.99">was around his heart and around the</text>
  <text start="3005.5" dur="7.05">vessels the aorta and the vena cava and</text>
  <text start="3009.06" dur="6.58">his doctor gave him a barely pretty bad</text>
  <text start="3012.55" dur="6.27">prognosis he said look this is a very</text>
  <text start="3015.64" dur="5.85">rare form of cancer it&amp;#39;s not easy to</text>
  <text start="3018.82" dur="4.14">treat if we do surgery we probably can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3021.49" dur="3.48">even get all of it because it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3022.96" dur="3.69">a risk that we&amp;#39;re gonna rip open some of</text>
  <text start="3024.97" dur="4.17">your large blood vessels and you bleed</text>
  <text start="3026.65" dur="4.89">to death so the guy said let me pray</text>
  <text start="3029.14" dur="5.13">about it and then I&amp;#39;ll see what the Lord</text>
  <text start="3031.54" dur="5.67">says so the guy was praying first thing</text>
  <text start="3034.27" dur="5.07">the Lord said was I want you to have the</text>
  <text start="3037.21" dur="3.39">surgery he said are you sure and the</text>
  <text start="3039.34" dur="4.05">Lord said and you need to have the</text>
  <text start="3040.6" dur="4.89">surgery so he went in back to the doctor</text>
  <text start="3043.39" dur="4.2">and they scheduled him for surgery and</text>
  <text start="3045.49" dur="3.24">then the surgeon said we&amp;#39;re not gonna be</text>
  <text start="3047.59" dur="2.1">able to get all of it I&amp;#39;m just gonna let</text>
  <text start="3048.73" dur="2.37">you know right ahead of time we&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="3049.69" dur="3.18">gonna be able to get it all we&amp;#39;ll get as</text>
  <text start="3051.1" dur="3.66">much of the cancer as we can so when I</text>
  <text start="3052.87" dur="4.83">had the surgery everything went fine</text>
  <text start="3054.76" dur="4.62">he comes out and the doc says we got</text>
  <text start="3057.7" dur="3.87">most of it but there&amp;#39;s still some cancer</text>
  <text start="3059.38" dur="3.45">there but it&amp;#39;s too dangerous for us to</text>
  <text start="3061.57" dur="3.18">try to remove it so you&amp;#39;re just gonna</text>
  <text start="3062.83" dur="5.28">you know we&amp;#39;ll do chemo and radiation</text>
  <text start="3064.75" dur="5.22">and then the guy says I&amp;#39;m not gonna do</text>
  <text start="3068.11" dur="3">chemo and radiation yet I&amp;#39;m gonna pray</text>
  <text start="3069.97" dur="4.62">again and see what the Lord wants me to</text>
  <text start="3071.11" dur="5.1">do so he prays and Lord says you don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3074.59" dur="3.45">need chemo and radiation you just need</text>
  <text start="3076.21" dur="3.9">to have your friends get around and pray</text>
  <text start="3078.04" dur="4.47">for you so he has a little prayer</text>
  <text start="3080.11" dur="4.23">meeting friends pray for him he goes</text>
  <text start="3082.51" dur="7.23">back in they do another scan and all the</text>
  <text start="3084.34" dur="8.4">rest of the cancer is gone the natural</text>
  <text start="3089.74" dur="4.36">and practical and and you have to be</text>
  <text start="3092.74" dur="4.45">open to let</text>
  <text start="3094.1" dur="5.52">do it however he was to do it and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3097.19" dur="5.31">not the same way every time yeah</text>
  <text start="3099.62" dur="6.39">actually my mother died that way my</text>
  <text start="3102.5" dur="6.87">mother got uterine cancer and she was</text>
  <text start="3106.01" dur="7.05">dead sent you know just who&amp;#39;s against</text>
  <text start="3109.37" dur="5.88">chemo and anything else so she let them</text>
  <text start="3113.06" dur="4.65">do the surgery I said well my view her</text>
  <text start="3115.25" dur="5.79">from God no so she stood on something</text>
  <text start="3117.71" dur="5.07">that he hadn&amp;#39;t seen it right and then</text>
  <text start="3121.04" dur="3.9">when it progressed so far and she</text>
  <text start="3122.78" dur="3.45">realized oh maybe I should try me maybe</text>
  <text start="3124.94" dur="1.8">I should try something that it was too</text>
  <text start="3126.23" dur="3.09">late</text>
  <text start="3126.74" dur="5.07">right so and I and you and I&amp;#39;ve seen</text>
  <text start="3129.32" dur="4.11">that with other people where they just</text>
  <text start="3131.81" dur="3.66">don&amp;#39;t give and this is the value of his</text>
  <text start="3133.43" dur="4.38">voice to give him the chance to tell you</text>
  <text start="3135.47" dur="4.17">what to do and don&amp;#39;t assume that is</text>
  <text start="3137.81" dur="3.93">gonna be supernatural and don&amp;#39;t assume</text>
  <text start="3139.64" dur="4.23">that is gonna be practical you got to be</text>
  <text start="3141.74" dur="4.58">open so what&amp;#39;d he tell you to do that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3143.87" dur="5.43">the way that&amp;#39;s going to work exactly</text>
  <text start="3146.32" dur="4.87">yeah I mean if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="3149.3" dur="3.45">the charismatic Pentecostal Church it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3151.19" dur="3.93">real easy to just assume God&amp;#39;s gonna</text>
  <text start="3152.75" dur="3.96">supernaturally send some angel down</text>
  <text start="3155.12" dur="3.12">who&amp;#39;s gonna give you a new lung or a new</text>
  <text start="3156.71" dur="3.99">heart transplant something like that</text>
  <text start="3158.24" dur="4.5">where whereas God may actually have a</text>
  <text start="3160.7" dur="3.93">different plan and you need to like you</text>
  <text start="3162.74" dur="3.93">said give him a chance to speak to you</text>
  <text start="3164.63" dur="4.47">and tell you what he wants to do I mean</text>
  <text start="3166.67" dur="5.58">what did Jesus say I only do what I see</text>
  <text start="3169.1" dur="7.47">the father doing even how do you know</text>
  <text start="3172.25" dur="6.24">you have to ask after a yeah I didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3176.57" dur="5.52">say I only do it I assume the father</text>
  <text start="3178.49" dur="8.19">wants me to do we kind of assumed</text>
  <text start="3182.09" dur="6.27">sometimes we do that a lot of times and</text>
  <text start="3186.68" dur="3.93">so I&amp;#39;ve gotten to the place I&amp;#39;ve gotten</text>
  <text start="3188.36" dur="4.5">much better with you know I&amp;#39;ve gotten to</text>
  <text start="3190.61" dur="4.17">the place where I trust him and I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="3192.86" dur="5.43">seen him do enough things where I just I</text>
  <text start="3194.78" dur="6.09">trust him but it took some time it took</text>
  <text start="3198.29" dur="6.15">me failing and sometimes I still fail</text>
  <text start="3200.87" dur="6.54">but I trusted more than I ever had and</text>
  <text start="3204.44" dur="4.74">so you know I&amp;#39;m at peace all the time I</text>
  <text start="3207.41" dur="3.93">walk around in peace all the time I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="3209.18" dur="6.51">just you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the thing</text>
  <text start="3211.34" dur="7.41">that gosh I hope the people who struggle</text>
  <text start="3215.69" dur="5.46">with getting beat up by Satan and their</text>
  <text start="3218.75" dur="4.59">life is a mess and they lost their job</text>

  <text start="3241.85" dur="5.55">have been through hell on earth for</text>
  <text start="3244.01" dur="5.46">about seven years but in all of those</text>
  <text start="3247.4" dur="3.9">things that I went through what the Lord</text>
  <text start="3249.47" dur="4.92">was doing was he was teaching me how to</text>
  <text start="3251.3" dur="5.97">trust him if you allow God to do that</text>
  <text start="3254.39" dur="5.4">work in you and if you allow him to put</text>
  <text start="3257.27" dur="4.95">you through some trials and tests you&amp;#39;ll</text>
  <text start="3259.79" dur="5.01">come out the other side of it a person</text>
  <text start="3262.22" dur="6">who has peace in every single</text>
  <text start="3264.8" dur="5.22">circumstance no and you&amp;#39;re that you&amp;#39;re</text>

  <text start="3270.02" dur="4.74">peace you did not get rattled about</text>
  <text start="3272.72" dur="4.5">things that happen but you know the</text>
  <text start="3274.76" dur="5.1">thing is what people don&amp;#39;t realize is</text>
  <text start="3277.22" dur="4.71">when we talk about the voice of God when</text>
  <text start="3279.86" dur="4.92">you get rattled you only make it harder</text>
  <text start="3281.93" dur="4.23">to hear you only make it harder to hear</text>
  <text start="3284.78" dur="3.09">him because now your emotions are</text>
  <text start="3286.16" dur="3.24">everywhere and instead of having one</text>
  <text start="3287.87" dur="3">voice you get a whole bunch of voices in</text>
  <text start="3289.4" dur="2.91">your head you got voices of worry you</text>
  <text start="3290.87" dur="4.23">got fear you got all of this stuff</text>

  <text start="3311.69" dur="2.64">I can have any money because God really</text>
  <text start="3312.86" dur="3.21">doesn&amp;#39;t care about you because if he did</text>
  <text start="3314.33" dur="3.57">he wouldn&amp;#39;t be let this happen I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="3316.07" dur="3.6">think they&amp;#39;ll do all of that and so</text>
  <text start="3317.9" dur="4.05">that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve come into that place</text>
  <text start="3319.67" dur="3.9">like even with witchcraft</text>
  <text start="3321.95" dur="3.45">like people get all worried Satan is</text>
  <text start="3323.57" dur="3.6">doing which crab uh-oh which is this</text>
  <text start="3325.4" dur="3.81">like in our area now we have this group</text>
  <text start="3327.17" dur="3.99">because some of the Christians have</text>
  <text start="3329.21" dur="5.01">started little Christian programs in the</text>
  <text start="3331.16" dur="4.95">school and so now the Satanists have</text>
  <text start="3334.22" dur="4.23">decided well if the Christians can have</text>

  <text start="3727.11" dur="4.38">this delegated to America he happened to</text>
  <text start="3729.45" dur="4.26">live around the corner from me and so</text>
  <text start="3731.49" dur="5.67">we&amp;#39;re in class and we&amp;#39;re doing all these</text>
  <text start="3733.71" dur="5.7">things and they started to talk about</text>
  <text start="3737.16" dur="4.35">how he is the real deal and so they</text>
  <text start="3739.41" dur="5.22">talked about how he stood in the middle</text>
  <text start="3741.51" dur="4.47">of an auditorium and invited the people</text>
  <text start="3744.63" dur="4.62">in the audience to come down and try to</text>
  <text start="3745.98" dur="7.32">move and he conjures up his Chi energy</text>
  <text start="3749.25" dur="6.06">and they can&amp;#39;t move and now my other</text>
  <text start="3753.3" dur="3.78">instructor is bigger than him younger</text>
  <text start="3755.31" dur="4.62">than him stronger than him but he</text>
  <text start="3757.08" dur="5.25">couldn&amp;#39;t that move and so say oh that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3759.93" dur="4.11">interesting so I didn&amp;#39;t they</text>
  <text start="3762.33" dur="3.21">about at the time I was I wasn&amp;#39;t in a</text>
  <text start="3764.04" dur="3.84">backslidden State at the time I just</text>
  <text start="3765.54" dur="4.47">wasn&amp;#39;t really pursuing anything in</text>
  <text start="3767.88" dur="3.96">regard ministry had neglected the gifts</text>
  <text start="3770.01" dur="4.98">and let him go doing it and all that</text>
  <text start="3771.84" dur="4.8">kind of stuff so oh yeah he could do</text>
  <text start="3774.99" dur="3.93">that he could he could but they teach</text>
  <text start="3776.64" dur="3.57">that in martial arts and a lot of people</text>
  <text start="3778.92" dur="3.48">don&amp;#39;t realize that you start climbing up</text>
  <text start="3780.21" dur="4.2">for no second third or fifth they</text>
  <text start="3782.4" dur="3.69">started teaching you the occult part of</text>
  <text start="3784.41" dur="4.74">it there of course they don&amp;#39;t call it</text>
  <text start="3786.09" dur="5.88">the occult part of it but it actually is</text>
  <text start="3789.15" dur="5.51">and so I got exposed to it you know</text>
  <text start="3791.97" dur="5.07">really early on like in high school I</text>
  <text start="3794.66" dur="5.11">wanted to be a ninja</text>
  <text start="3797.04" dur="6.63">so I studied some ninjutsu and so in</text>
  <text start="3799.77" dur="5.88">then Jitsu you you do learn like we had</text>
  <text start="3803.67" dur="4.05">a buddy that with he he called it</text>
  <text start="3805.65" dur="4.14">pulling you call it pulling the spirit</text>
  <text start="3807.72" dur="3.84">out of a person so you would focus on</text>
  <text start="3809.79" dur="3.54">the person and then you would make this</text>
  <text start="3811.56" dur="3.42">pulling movement and so he would do this</text>
  <text start="3813.33" dur="3.96">and people will be running and collapsed</text>
  <text start="3814.98" dur="4.83">to the ground you know this is the other</text>
  <text start="3817.29" dur="4.26">part Dave this same point I was in</text>
  <text start="3819.81" dur="3.18">church but I was thought to have</text>
  <text start="3821.55" dur="7.59">experiences with the supernatural</text>
  <text start="3822.99" dur="7.83">outside of church Church was spiritually</text>
  <text start="3829.14" dur="4.14">dead and nothing was happening but you</text>
  <text start="3830.82" dur="4.38">were still your spirit was wanting to</text>
  <text start="3833.28" dur="5.37">engage probably the spiritual realm in</text>
  <text start="3835.2" dur="7.14">some manner and I think it goes back to</text>
  <text start="3838.65" dur="5.61">that God gives us a gift and then he</text>
  <text start="3842.34" dur="4.53">comes along and activates it but before</text>
  <text start="3844.26" dur="5.54">he does Satan tries to activate it so he</text>
  <text start="3846.87" dur="8.4">tries to do a lot of other things so I</text>
  <text start="3849.8" dur="8.77">had learned about soul travel and all of</text>
  <text start="3855.27" dur="4.77">that stuff I learned that early on and I</text>
  <text start="3858.57" dur="4.85">never could make it work it&amp;#39;s at one</text>
  <text start="3860.04" dur="5.73">time I had I always had a problem with</text>
  <text start="3863.42" dur="4.72">collapsing lungs my lungs were</text>
  <text start="3865.77" dur="3.84">spontaneously collapsed at 17 they</text>
  <text start="3868.14" dur="5.7">started to spontaneously collapse</text>
  <text start="3869.61" dur="7.2">anywhere for any reason and one day I</text>
  <text start="3873.84" dur="5.01">ended up they ended up collapsing and it</text>
  <text start="3876.81" dur="3.75">caused me a problem so my parents found</text>
  <text start="3878.85" dur="3.75">outside and told them anything I just</text>
  <text start="3880.56" dur="4.02">ain&amp;#39;t no wit word just went on about my</text>
  <text start="3882.6" dur="4.98">business but eventually I ended up in</text>
  <text start="3884.58" dur="4.83">surgery and I have to have you I get</text>
  <text start="3887.58" dur="3.63">little blisters on the lung and I</text>
  <text start="3889.41" dur="3.21">blisters with it would explode and call</text>
  <text start="3891.21" dur="2.58">it the lung to fall off the chest wall</text>
  <text start="3892.62" dur="3.19">so they went in and cut all these</text>
  <text start="3893.79" dur="4.48">blisters off but</text>
  <text start="3895.81" dur="4.92">well while I was in the hospital the</text>
  <text start="3898.27" dur="4.08">left side collapsed so the right side</text>
  <text start="3900.73" dur="3.81">was still healing I had just answered</text>
  <text start="3902.35" dur="4.92">and the left side collapse and you know</text>
  <text start="3904.54" dur="4.8">as a paramedic I can&amp;#39;t have an</text>
  <text start="3907.27" dur="4.5">anesthesia because it&amp;#39;s gonna lower my</text>
  <text start="3909.34" dur="4.98">breathing so it&amp;#39;s like a local</text>
  <text start="3911.77" dur="4.02">anesthetic so they take out the scalpel</text>
  <text start="3914.32" dur="4.92">and they give me this little local</text>
  <text start="3915.79" dur="3.99">numbing thing I said I&amp;#39;m not staying</text>
  <text start="3919.24" dur="3.69">here</text>
  <text start="3919.78" dur="5.67">and I closed my eyes and imagined I was</text>
  <text start="3922.93" dur="6.5">in the field and I was gone when I came</text>
  <text start="3925.45" dur="3.98">back it was all over I felt nothing</text>
  <text start="3930.63" dur="9.25">experienced these these things outside</text>
  <text start="3934.89" dur="6.88">of God so it&amp;#39;s okay so martial arts you</text>
  <text start="3939.88" dur="3.96">know I&amp;#39;m not a guy who they all don&amp;#39;t do</text>
  <text start="3941.77" dur="3.63">more to arts but when you you just got</text>
  <text start="3943.84" dur="4.17">to know when you get in there is a part</text>
  <text start="3945.4" dur="5.969">of it that leans into the occult</text>
  <text start="3948.01" dur="4.8">practices of it where you know in the</text>
  <text start="3951.369" dur="3.961">reason why you can put your hands to a</text>
  <text start="3952.81" dur="4.05">brick and you&amp;#39;re the first thing they</text>
  <text start="3955.33" dur="3.3">teach you before you can do that is you</text>
  <text start="3956.86" dur="4.17">got to be able to cultivate a certain</text>
  <text start="3958.63" dur="5.61">amount of spiritual power inside of you</text>
  <text start="3961.03" dur="5.82">so that you can do that essentially it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="3964.24" dur="5.39">it&amp;#39;s a form of energy work I&amp;#39;m guessing</text>
  <text start="3966.85" dur="6.87">yeah they teach you how to control your</text>
  <text start="3969.63" dur="7.12">really you know energy and what was</text>
  <text start="3973.72" dur="5.67">interesting is what I when I was taking</text>
  <text start="3976.75" dur="5.22">the class you know I already knew I had</text>
  <text start="3979.39" dur="4.53">my prophetic gifting and senses and you</text>
  <text start="3981.97" dur="3.6">know just a shopping your instincts</text>
  <text start="3983.92" dur="3.689">because you know what&amp;#39;s coming</text>
  <text start="3985.57" dur="4.11">they just shopping your instincts you</text>
  <text start="3987.609" dur="4.471">saw people their punches coming before</text>
  <text start="3989.68" dur="5.34">they came at you I could yeah yeah it</text>
  <text start="3992.08" dur="4.71">was split-second before so I always so I</text>
  <text start="3995.02" dur="4.32">was dominating the black ghost</text>
  <text start="3996.79" dur="5.49">now mind you this is a special forces</text>
  <text start="3999.34" dur="4.62">class I was a white belt but he put you</text>
  <text start="4002.28" dur="3.48">up on the floor against anybody and they</text>
  <text start="4003.96" dur="4.56">were pulled but I wasn&amp;#39;t dominating the</text>
  <text start="4005.76" dur="5.04">black fellows and the brown belts and</text>
  <text start="4008.52" dur="6.15">that&amp;#39;s because I had this advantage man</text>
  <text start="4010.8" dur="6.87">to tap I didn&amp;#39;t know that it was</text>
  <text start="4014.67" dur="5.22">something else that probably came from</text>
  <text start="4017.67" dur="4.11">you know cuz if he&amp;#39;s cultivating that</text>
  <text start="4019.89" dur="4.5">kind of power at the top then that</text>
  <text start="4021.78" dur="6.12">spirit is ruling that particular dojo</text>
  <text start="4024.39" dur="4.8">and so my senses are shot and I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4027.9" dur="3.3">blocking everything</text>
  <text start="4029.19" dur="5.129">stop and everything I can beat them to</text>
  <text start="4031.2" dur="5.79">the punch I&amp;#39;m faster I&amp;#39;m stronger and I</text>
  <text start="4034.319" dur="4.171">thought nothing of it I kept saying well</text>
  <text start="4036.99" dur="4.14">it&amp;#39;s good saying my way God is teaching</text>
  <text start="4038.49" dur="4.02">me how to fight if that wasn&amp;#39;t assertive</text>
  <text start="4041.13" dur="4.5">he&amp;#39;s teaching me how to fight because I</text>
  <text start="4042.51" dur="5.22">was coming back to class with I can do</text>
  <text start="4045.63" dur="4.17">this I could do that I could see it all</text>
  <text start="4047.73" dur="5.67">these I was being fed visual these</text>
  <text start="4049.8" dur="5.73">revelations on how to fight God behind a</text>
  <text start="4053.4" dur="3.6">fire I&amp;#39;m so you were kind of like you</text>
  <text start="4055.53" dur="3.539">were kind of like neo in the matrix</text>
  <text start="4057" dur="4.38">getting this training going on I was</text>
  <text start="4059.069" dur="4.441">getting a download on fighting I got a</text>
  <text start="4061.38" dur="4.77">downloading but it was yeah it was just</text>
  <text start="4063.51" dur="5.339">like that and I didn&amp;#39;t say anything of</text>
  <text start="4066.15" dur="4.26">it until I hurt my back and I couldn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4068.849" dur="5.551">go back to class and I went to go back</text>
  <text start="4070.41" dur="6.39">and by this time I had started really</text>
  <text start="4074.4" dur="8.669">engaging my relationship with God again</text>
  <text start="4076.8" dur="7.59">and he said uh no I love it and so I</text>
  <text start="4083.069" dur="3.241">figured maybe he want me to go back</text>
  <text start="4084.39" dur="4.77">because maybe my back is not quite where</text>
  <text start="4086.31" dur="5.13">it needs to be and then he also wanted</text>
  <text start="4089.16" dur="5.01">me to write the book so this is my first</text>
  <text start="4091.44" dur="5.19">experience with learning about the</text>
  <text start="4094.17" dur="4.2">reality of imagination no Dave I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4096.63" dur="3.18">never told anybody this you&amp;#39;ll be the</text>
  <text start="4098.37" dur="3.69">first person you and the listeners you&amp;#39;d</text>

  <text start="4102.06" dur="4.56">and my father said well if you want to</text>
  <text start="4104.069" dur="4.831">practice your your forms you know in</text>
  <text start="4106.62" dur="4.369">martial arts the forms are those when</text>
  <text start="4108.9" dur="4.02">you see us practice fighting ourselves</text>
  <text start="4110.989" dur="3.25">and you&amp;#39;re supposed to imagine that</text>
  <text start="4112.92" dur="3.24">there&amp;#39;s somebody you&amp;#39;re fighting and you</text>
  <text start="4114.239" dur="3.571">start fighting that person and that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4116.16" dur="3.119">how you strengthen your move your speed</text>
  <text start="4117.81" dur="4.44">and all of that kind of stuff</text>
  <text start="4119.279" dur="4.861">well my father said well you sit your</text>
  <text start="4122.25" dur="4.08">back you can kind of messed up do it in</text>
  <text start="4124.14" dur="5.119">your mind okay I&amp;#39;m gonna do it in my</text>
  <text start="4126.33" dur="6.3">mind so I&amp;#39;m doing it in my mind and</text>
  <text start="4129.259" dur="6.431">while I&amp;#39;m seeing myself practicing the</text>
  <text start="4132.63" dur="6.149">movements this black figure shows up so</text>
  <text start="4135.69" dur="3.629">no so I&amp;#39;m fighting with this black</text>
  <text start="4138.779" dur="4.56">figure</text>
  <text start="4139.319" dur="6.27">but as I&amp;#39;m fighting I can feel every bit</text>
  <text start="4143.339" dur="3.9">of movement I mean it feels like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4145.589" dur="3.571">punching for real it feels like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4147.239" dur="4.83">kicking for real and so I&amp;#39;m thinking</text>
  <text start="4149.16" dur="4.92">what in the world is going on so I think</text>
  <text start="4152.069" dur="5.161">I&amp;#39;m just fighting with the creature and</text>
  <text start="4154.08" dur="5.25">practicing my moves and I&amp;#39;m still</text>
  <text start="4157.23" dur="3.66">stripping in my revelation and learning</text>
  <text start="4159.33" dur="2.759">how to fight welcome to that was a great</text>
  <text start="4160.89" dur="4.05">movement</text>
  <text start="4162.089" dur="5.041">and it wasn&amp;#39;t long after it&amp;#39;s like a two</text>
  <text start="4164.94" dur="4.679">weeks after I&amp;#39;m sitting on the couch and</text>
  <text start="4167.13" dur="4.589">I feel something for in my head I think</text>
  <text start="4169.619" dur="5.04">what is that on my head I said there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4171.719" dur="5.1">he and he&amp;#39;s on my head so I said I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4174.659" dur="5.25">gonna fight it so I imagine myself</text>
  <text start="4176.819" dur="6.241">fighting with this this beam and again</text>
  <text start="4179.909" dur="5.73">BAM he shows up but again I&amp;#39;ve noticed</text>
  <text start="4183.06" dur="4.889">that it feels really real</text>
  <text start="4185.639" dur="4.591">it feels like I&amp;#39;m kicking I&amp;#39;m punching</text>
  <text start="4187.949" dur="3.781">but the kicker for me at this time I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4190.23" dur="4.679">still thinking what this is just just</text>
  <text start="4191.73" dur="5.4">imagination and until I realized I</text>
  <text start="4194.909" dur="4.56">couldn&amp;#39;t control him and he was winning</text>
  <text start="4197.13" dur="5.4">and he would beat me up if he was no</text>
  <text start="4199.469" dur="6.301">longer for partnering with me sticking</text>
  <text start="4202.53" dur="5.28">my foot so I finally won and I laid back</text>
  <text start="4205.77" dur="5.969">on the couch and just amazed me like</text>
  <text start="4207.81" dur="8.309">what is happening and when I lay back I</text>
  <text start="4211.739" dur="8.13">was I was as tired and sore every place</text>
  <text start="4216.119" dur="5.551">he hit me I was sore on my body my neck</text>
  <text start="4219.869" dur="3.391">was sore from where he had jammed my</text>
  <text start="4221.67" dur="3.989">neck everything was sold I slept for</text>
  <text start="4223.26" dur="4.709">like 12 hours I was so tired after that</text>
  <text start="4225.659" dur="5.281">now my normal night of sleep is five to</text>
  <text start="4227.969" dur="6.661">six hours my wife could yeah why I was</text>
  <text start="4230.94" dur="7.159">so sleepy and so from that experience I</text>
  <text start="4234.63" dur="6.54">learned he this is there&amp;#39;s more to this</text>
  <text start="4238.099" dur="5.111">imagination and things then then we</text>
  <text start="4241.17" dur="4.41">would like to believe there may be some</text>
  <text start="4243.21" dur="5.219">of the things we see and that as unreal</text>
  <text start="4245.58" dur="5.61">as we&amp;#39;d like to think because you know</text>
  <text start="4248.429" dur="5.69">like you know you and Michael know when</text>
  <text start="4251.19" dur="7.98">God first opened my eyes I could see</text>
  <text start="4254.119" dur="7.33">with them wide open so I came home one</text>
  <text start="4259.17" dur="4.049">night from and put it over the first</text>
  <text start="4261.449" dur="4.23">time I saw it first redeeming care that</text>
  <text start="4263.219" dur="4.38">at first that freaked me out and it was</text>
  <text start="4265.679" dur="4.351">at the same church this time it was</text>
  <text start="4267.599" dur="4.011">another guy came in and so I get home</text>
  <text start="4270.03" dur="4.2">that night and I&amp;#39;m looking out my window</text>
  <text start="4271.61" dur="4.45">and as I&amp;#39;m looking out the window</text>
  <text start="4274.23" dur="4.23">there&amp;#39;s some eyes that are looking back</text>
  <text start="4276.06" dur="4.32">at mine that&amp;#39;s going wait the world I</text>
  <text start="4278.46" dur="3.659">turn it around and it looks like I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4280.38" dur="4.859">like no those waves were you seeing in</text>
  <text start="4282.119" dur="6.381">the spirit like underwater if I turn</text>
  <text start="4285.239" dur="6.781">around and they&amp;#39;re demons in the room</text>
  <text start="4288.5" dur="5.409">circling me looking at me and now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4292.02" dur="3.969">really like freaking out because I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="4293.909" dur="4.241">know with that so I</text>
  <text start="4295.989" dur="4.951">get on the beach I try to cover my eyes</text>
  <text start="4298.15" dur="4.83">with my owns and the covers but I could</text>
  <text start="4300.94" dur="7.5">still see through everything I could see</text>
  <text start="4302.98" dur="5.849">the dresser like I&amp;#39;m kind of freak it</text>
  <text start="4308.44" dur="3.449">out</text>
  <text start="4308.829" dur="4.62">so I&amp;#39;m sleeping with the lights on and</text>
  <text start="4311.889" dur="4.621">that&amp;#39;s when I started battles with those</text>
  <text start="4313.449" dur="4.681">sleep paralysis and you know that&amp;#39;s how</text>
  <text start="4316.51" dur="3.569">I met some of the other ones like you</text>
  <text start="4318.13" dur="4.949">know I used to rap didn&amp;#39;t think nothing</text>
  <text start="4320.079" dur="6.54">of my rap stuff but part of my salvation</text>
  <text start="4323.079" dur="6.241">story was I was rapping and really</text>
  <text start="4326.619" dur="5.79">wasn&amp;#39;t going anywhere and but I always</text>
  <text start="4329.32" dur="5.009">had these dry spells where just had like</text>
  <text start="4332.409" dur="3.181">a writer&amp;#39;s block I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out</text>
  <text start="4334.329" dur="4.681">what&amp;#39;s going on with the writer&amp;#39;s block</text>
  <text start="4335.59" dur="5.429">so what I would do is I started by</text>
  <text start="4339.01" dur="4.799">sitting in the dark and I was sitting</text>
  <text start="4341.019" dur="4.29">the dog can wait until I heard something</text>
  <text start="4343.809" dur="3.841">didn&amp;#39;t know I was listening at the time</text>
  <text start="4345.309" dur="3.901">but I knew I was here thought and when I</text>
  <text start="4347.65" dur="2.429">heard it would always if I got the first</text>
  <text start="4349.21" dur="2.579">line</text>
  <text start="4350.079" dur="3.301">it was lean and it would just run like a</text>
  <text start="4351.789" dur="4.801">prophecy would just run I could write</text>
  <text start="4353.38" dur="5.52">four days of this inspiration after a</text>
  <text start="4356.59" dur="4.199">while that didn&amp;#39;t work sounds like me so</text>
  <text start="4358.9" dur="4.619">I sat in the dark and started thinking</text>
  <text start="4360.789" dur="4.08">of all of the painful experiences of my</text>
  <text start="4363.519" dur="3.211">life I don&amp;#39;t know why I did that I guess</text>
  <text start="4364.869" dur="4.02">something told me some things of all and</text>
  <text start="4366.73" dur="3.929">I made myself angry and I&amp;#39;m now I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4368.889" dur="3.571">writing in the dark and while I&amp;#39;m angry</text>
  <text start="4370.659" dur="4.321">but then that didn&amp;#39;t work so then I</text>
  <text start="4372.46" dur="4.829">started listening to crazy music living</text>
  <text start="4374.98" dur="6.719">it and it was drawing me in deeper and</text>
  <text start="4377.289" dur="8.941">deeper and deeper and eventually I was</text>
  <text start="4381.699" dur="8.101">my songs took on such a crazy crazy</text>
  <text start="4386.23" dur="5.88">sound and they were so dark and dreary</text>
  <text start="4389.8" dur="5.1">and I remember I was cool you know it</text>
  <text start="4392.11" dur="5.429">was just crazy and I mean my friends</text>
  <text start="4394.9" dur="5.699">used to say Kevin you&amp;#39;re good at this</text>
  <text start="4397.539" dur="4.531">but we can&amp;#39;t listen to your song for us</text>
  <text start="4400.599" dur="4.201">for whatever reason when we listen to</text>
  <text start="4402.07" dur="8.16">your songs it paints pictures in our</text>
  <text start="4404.8" dur="7.56">mind with scary things I was like what I</text>
  <text start="4410.23" dur="5.94">was a little offended so that&amp;#39;s when I</text>
  <text start="4412.36" dur="6.12">really started paying attention and that</text>
  <text start="4416.17" dur="5.549">was how I got saved because one day I</text>
  <text start="4418.48" dur="5.099">got mad at a family member and I had a</text>
  <text start="4421.719" dur="3.661">vision but in the vision I was doing</text>
  <text start="4423.579" dur="4.08">something hideous I was murdering the</text>
  <text start="4425.38" dur="4.32">person and I said something is wrong and</text>
  <text start="4427.659" dur="3.931">so something is wrong so did I</text>
  <text start="4429.7" dur="3.27">then I had to really turn and you know I</text>
  <text start="4431.59" dur="3.96">grew up in the church so I knew at least</text>
  <text start="4432.97" dur="5.1">where to go so I went to God he helped</text>
  <text start="4435.55" dur="5.04">me out with this but so so when I&amp;#39;ve</text>
  <text start="4438.07" dur="4.32">learned the value of imagination that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="4440.59" dur="5.15">why when I teach people about listening</text>
  <text start="4442.39" dur="5.63">and hearing it&amp;#39;s really important</text>
  <text start="4445.74" dur="4.9">imagination because like I talked about</text>

  <text start="4543.46" dur="6.87">sudden I started to think well if I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="4547.21" dur="6.03">thinking and where&amp;#39;s this song coming</text>

  <text start="4584.41" dur="4.5">that&amp;#39;s how that&amp;#39;s when I started one but</text>
  <text start="4587.29" dur="5.22">those experience to me have been so</text>
  <text start="4588.91" dur="6.72">valuable because I know that you know</text>
  <text start="4592.51" dur="6.57">the word spirit means wind or breath</text>
  <text start="4595.63" dur="5.31">it&amp;#39;s really just inspiration and so I</text>

  <text start="5040.05" dur="5.07">Revelation demon with a sound is life so</text>
  <text start="5042.51" dur="5.79">I get these these assignments where</text>
  <text start="5045.12" dur="4.83">where they come after me for saying say</text>
  <text start="5048.3" dur="3.99">God say it so he talks to me and I get</text>
  <text start="5049.95" dur="4.71">in trouble especially if he talked to me</text>
  <text start="5052.29" dur="4.59">about stuff with them and I get in</text>
  <text start="5054.66" dur="4.11">trouble so what they had begun doing is</text>
  <text start="5056.88" dur="4.65">every time he talks to me they said</text>
  <text start="5058.77" dur="5.34">sickness that our I was like man what&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5061.53" dur="5.64">going on if people keep you to see in</text>
  <text start="5064.11" dur="5.94">the house so and what they were trying</text>
  <text start="5067.17" dur="4.62">to do was jump from the kids to me but</text>
  <text start="5070.05" dur="4.71">they couldn&amp;#39;t get to me they kept trying</text>
  <text start="5071.79" dur="5.25">and it wouldn&amp;#39;t state and so I said okay</text>
  <text start="5074.76" dur="4.59">i&amp;#39;ma have to start teaching these these</text>
  <text start="5077.04" dur="5.19">children about how to resist still</text>
  <text start="5079.35" dur="6.03">teaching them they&amp;#39;ve gotten better so</text>
  <text start="5082.23" dur="5.73">that&amp;#39;s where it started but one of the</text>
  <text start="5085.38" dur="4.26">things he began showing me is like</text>
  <text start="5087.96" dur="4.38">Christians will say Christians can&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5089.64" dur="5.76">have been-- but when you look at Jesus</text>
  <text start="5092.34" dur="5.369">ministry he accepted Mary Magdalene&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5095.4" dur="5.579">case you see Jesus he was attached</text>
  <text start="5097.709" dur="5.49">Sofia even castile anger malice lust he</text>
  <text start="5100.979" dur="3.841">doesn&amp;#39;t cast out those who spirits now</text>
  <text start="5103.199" dur="3.27">we know that they exist and we know we</text>
  <text start="5104.82" dur="3.69">cast him out and I think he didn&amp;#39;t put</text>
  <text start="5106.469" dur="2.911">that in there because he knew we would</text>
  <text start="5108.51" dur="3.359">figure that part out</text>
  <text start="5109.38" dur="6.27">which we had spoke the part that people</text>
  <text start="5111.869" dur="6.69">generally miss is they don&amp;#39;t look at the</text>
  <text start="5115.65" dur="5.549">fact that all of Jesus ministry and</text>
  <text start="5118.559" dur="4.71">casting out demons the majority of it</text>
  <text start="5121.199" dur="3.9">was casting out demons that cause some</text>
  <text start="5123.269" dur="6.031">kind of sickness there was deafness</text>
  <text start="5125.099" dur="7.59">it was seizures seizures right it was it</text>
  <text start="5129.3" dur="9.089">was always something uh fever Peter&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5132.689" dur="7.711">mother had a fever yep and and so I but</text>
  <text start="5138.389" dur="3.661">I couldn&amp;#39;t argue that with anybody I was</text>
  <text start="5140.4" dur="4.079">like mangoes no Christian to try to</text>
  <text start="5142.05" dur="4.98">argue da about whether Christians could</text>
  <text start="5144.479" dur="4.74">have a demon and so one day I was</text>
  <text start="5147.03" dur="4.709">reading Acts where Paul is carrying</text>
  <text start="5149.219" dur="5.49">Hankins body for the first time I saw</text>
  <text start="5151.739" dur="5.521">where it says it says hey I just came</text>
  <text start="5154.709" dur="6.12">from the from Paul&amp;#39;s body and were taken</text>
  <text start="5157.26" dur="5.85">to the sick and sickness and disease</text>
  <text start="5160.829" dur="4.201">left them and evil spirits went out of</text>
  <text start="5163.11" dur="3.48">them I said well hold on that&amp;#39;s two</text>
  <text start="5165.03" dur="2.609">separate things and they both believe in</text>
  <text start="5166.59" dur="2.58">the same thing</text>
  <text start="5167.639" dur="3.84">sick people I said there&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="5169.17" dur="4.71">relationship here and so then God really</text>
  <text start="5171.479" dur="5.52">started talking because then he started</text>
  <text start="5173.88" dur="5.489">showing me how all of these things</text>
  <text start="5176.999" dur="6.27">related to the law so when you look at</text>
  <text start="5179.369" dur="8.58">the law yeah fever is it&amp;#39;s one of the</text>
  <text start="5183.269" dur="6.12">curses in the law mental illness is one</text>
  <text start="5187.949" dur="3.15">of the curses in the law so you can see</text>
  <text start="5189.389" dur="3.181">all of these different curses in the law</text>
  <text start="5191.099" dur="4.531">and then for the first time I started</text>
  <text start="5192.57" dur="4.919">noticing that every time Israel lost a</text>
  <text start="5195.63" dur="3.989">battle it was because of the curse of</text>
  <text start="5197.489" dur="4.831">the law so you know could we read the</text>
  <text start="5199.619" dur="5.161">Bible we kind of separate things it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="5202.32" dur="6.029">like we isolate this experience like</text>
  <text start="5204.78" dur="5.399">with akin when at the city of a guy we</text>
  <text start="5208.349" dur="3.63">think oh he just stole a bad below he</text>
  <text start="5210.179" dur="3.81">did what God told him not to do and so</text>
  <text start="5211.979" dur="3.99">and took the stuff and hid it in his</text>
  <text start="5213.989" dur="4.53">tent and he would covered in and so but</text>
  <text start="5215.969" dur="4.88">when you go back to the law God already</text>
  <text start="5218.519" dur="5.361">tells you what&amp;#39;s going to happen and so</text>
  <text start="5220.849" dur="6.25">what he did was directly related to that</text>
  <text start="5223.88" dur="5.949">and so the sicknesses and disease were</text>
  <text start="5227.099" dur="4.86">related to that law and so when Jesus</text>
  <text start="5229.829" dur="6.34">comes on the scene</text>
  <text start="5231.959" dur="6.76">Jesus comes to the to Israel at a time</text>
  <text start="5236.169" dur="5.79">when they&amp;#39;ve been there under the curse</text>
  <text start="5238.719" dur="4.62">of the law which means they under the</text>
  <text start="5241.959" dur="3.15">curse of the law and you can see that</text>
  <text start="5243.339" dur="3.72">demons are involved in all of these</text>
  <text start="5245.109" dur="4.02">curses so God is explaining all this to</text>
  <text start="5247.059" dur="4.38">me I&amp;#39;ve never thought about it before</text>
  <text start="5249.129" dur="3.69">never notice that Jesus came doing that</text>
  <text start="5251.439" dur="3.42">picture you just think he just came to</text>
  <text start="5252.819" dur="4.35">Israel during the time is under Roman</text>
  <text start="5254.859" dur="4.14">rule but you don&amp;#39;t tie the fact that the</text>
  <text start="5257.169" dur="4.35">reason that they&amp;#39;re under Roman rule</text>
  <text start="5258.999" dur="4.65">when he said I will make you the bottom</text>
  <text start="5261.519" dur="3.66">and at the top was because they had been</text>
  <text start="5263.649" dur="5.19">disobedient and they were now living</text>
  <text start="5265.179" dur="4.86">under this curse of the law and you also</text>
  <text start="5268.839" dur="3.96">see that because there are a lot of</text>
  <text start="5270.039" dur="4.05">strange things that Jesus says that</text>
  <text start="5272.799" dur="3.211">you&amp;#39;d be like well why would you even</text>
  <text start="5274.089" dur="4.44">say that he says to a man go and sin no</text>
  <text start="5276.01" dur="3.869">more lest a worse thing come upon you</text>
  <text start="5278.529" dur="4.2">he&amp;#39;s like well why would Jesus say that</text>
  <text start="5279.879" dur="5.16">because up into that point Jesus hadn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5282.729" dur="4.92">died and so this man was still subject</text>
  <text start="5285.039" dur="4.68">to those curses in the law and Jesus</text>
  <text start="5287.649" dur="4.35">himself alludes to the fact that the</text>
  <text start="5289.719" dur="4.43">problem in his life was divert elect I</text>
  <text start="5291.999" dur="5.22">reckon he related to what he had done</text>
  <text start="5294.149" dur="5.71">then you&amp;#39;ll see the disciples say who</text>
  <text start="5297.219" dur="4.62">was born blind this man or his parents</text>
  <text start="5299.859" dur="4.56">and it seems like a strange question</text>
  <text start="5301.839" dur="4.77">until you realize they&amp;#39;re asking those</text>
  <text start="5304.419" dur="5.61">questions because they ask them in a</text>
  <text start="5306.609" dur="5.76">quarters with their law they understood</text>
  <text start="5310.029" dur="4.44">that if somebody was born blind or some</text>
  <text start="5312.369" dur="4.65">sickness it was because somebody had</text>
  <text start="5314.469" dur="5.041">broken the law it&amp;#39;s all related to the</text>
  <text start="5317.019" dur="4.741">law yeah it&amp;#39;s nothing for preachers</text>
  <text start="5319.51" dur="5.039">preach that and say oh they just made it</text>
  <text start="5321.76" dur="4.409">seem to make light of it and I did too</text>
  <text start="5324.549" dur="4.25">until God started talking to me about</text>
  <text start="5326.169" dur="6.54">this and so then he starts to show me</text>
  <text start="5328.799" dur="7.06">when Satan has come at Joe all of the</text>
  <text start="5332.709" dur="5.07">things he did for Joe we&amp;#39;re in the</text>
  <text start="5335.859" dur="5.55">curses are alone his children were</text>
  <text start="5337.779" dur="5.16">attacked his land was attacked and on</text>
  <text start="5341.409" dur="5.101">the other side of that all of the things</text>
  <text start="5342.939" dur="5.28">that job experiences because he had been</text>
  <text start="5346.51" dur="4.439">faithful and obedient and God said</text>
  <text start="5348.219" dur="4.38">you&amp;#39;ll have your children will be</text>
  <text start="5350.949" dur="4.71">blessed you&amp;#39;ll be multiplied you know</text>
  <text start="5352.599" dur="5.64">every if they will be blessed and so the</text>
  <text start="5355.659" dur="4.351">three are you are you referring to the</text>
  <text start="5358.239" dur="5.01">curses and blessings in Deuteronomy</text>
  <text start="5360.01" dur="4.85">right okay right you you can see those</text>
  <text start="5363.249" dur="4.071">in Joe</text>
  <text start="5364.86" dur="4.799">you can see both of them in joke so God</text>
  <text start="5367.32" dur="4.14">is teaching me have been teaching me all</text>
  <text start="5369.659" dur="5.671">of this so that I could make this stance</text>
  <text start="5371.46" dur="7.08">because when Paul says we have been</text>
  <text start="5375.33" dur="5.849">redeemed from the curse of the law they</text>
  <text start="5378.54" dur="4.139">understood it with that meant the church</text>
  <text start="5381.179" dur="3.391">doesn&amp;#39;t understand with that leader we</text>
  <text start="5382.679" dur="4.5">just think well we just God just do away</text>
  <text start="5384.57" dur="4.47">the law but he literally removes the</text>
  <text start="5387.179" dur="3.511">power of the curse of the law well one</text>
  <text start="5389.04" dur="4.679">of the things that God was showing me</text>
  <text start="5390.69" dur="5.46">was Satan had a job and so you&amp;#39;ll see an</text>
  <text start="5393.719" dur="4.111">evil spirit went out from the Lord you</text>
  <text start="5396.15" dur="3.569">seen passages like and it seems strange</text>
  <text start="5397.83" dur="4.409">why would it evil spirit quote from the</text>
  <text start="5399.719" dur="5.851">Lord that is until you go to revelations</text>
  <text start="5402.239" dur="5.791">he said well you have no more job here</text>
  <text start="5405.57" dur="5.49">saying the blood has resolved this issue</text>
  <text start="5408.03" dur="5.939">and you no longer have a job he has no</text>
  <text start="5411.06" dur="5.49">job because he can&amp;#39;t enforce a law that</text>
  <text start="5413.969" dur="4.141">is now dead and so now he just here kind</text>
  <text start="5416.55" dur="4.95">of running around ramping and so he</text>
  <text start="5418.11" dur="5.279">doesn&amp;#39;t literally have any right to this</text>
  <text start="5421.5" dur="4.139">so God said he don&amp;#39;t have any legal</text>
  <text start="5423.389" dur="5.461">right he&amp;#39;s operating outside of his</text>
  <text start="5425.639" dur="5.461">right and look I was I read your your</text>
  <text start="5428.85" dur="5.16">court of heaven jury and I said God is</text>
  <text start="5431.1" dur="4.41">telling him the same thing because when</text>
  <text start="5434.01" dur="4.77">you&amp;#39;re your court of heaven you talk</text>
  <text start="5435.51" dur="6.33">about going before the judge and you ask</text>
  <text start="5438.78" dur="4.98">for the books to be open and because the</text>
  <text start="5441.84" dur="4.109">you&amp;#39;re going into it because the demon</text>
  <text start="5443.76" dur="3.93">thinks he has a right whatever nothing</text>
  <text start="5445.949" dur="3.54">there&amp;#39;s nothing in the books but Jesus</text>
  <text start="5447.69" dur="3.48">has resolved it so he really doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5449.489" dur="3.331">have a right he doesn&amp;#39;t have a right</text>
  <text start="5451.17" dur="4.1">that&amp;#39;s one of the things that I get into</text>
  <text start="5452.82" dur="5">these discussions with people who they</text>
  <text start="5455.27" dur="5.65">come from the Word of Faith Movement and</text>
  <text start="5457.82" dur="5.71">they&amp;#39;ve been taught that there are no</text>
  <text start="5460.92" dur="5.52">legal rights that the enemy has any</text>
  <text start="5463.53" dur="4.89">longer to afflict us so why are we going</text>
  <text start="5466.44" dur="3.299">to court to try to remove a legal right</text>
  <text start="5468.42" dur="3.18">that the enemy doesn&amp;#39;t have in the first</text>
  <text start="5469.739" dur="4.021">place anymore well they&amp;#39;re not</text>
  <text start="5471.6" dur="4.59">understanding what the enemy is actually</text>
  <text start="5473.76" dur="5.399">doing what the enemy&amp;#39;s doing now is</text>
  <text start="5476.19" dur="4.77">illegal it&amp;#39;s unlawful there&amp;#39;s they don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="5479.159" dur="4.381">have a legal right to afflict this with</text>
  <text start="5480.96" dur="6.57">sickness they think they do but they</text>
  <text start="5483.54" dur="7.139">don&amp;#39;t so we have been given power and</text>
  <text start="5487.53" dur="4.98">authority okay what this Authority mean</text>
  <text start="5490.679" dur="3.471">it means go out and arrest lawless</text>
  <text start="5492.51" dur="3.959">criminals</text>
  <text start="5494.15" dur="4.05">all right so criminal breaks into your</text>
  <text start="5496.469" dur="3.681">house it robs your TV</text>
  <text start="5498.2" dur="4.11">furniture well he doesn&amp;#39;t have a legal</text>

  <text start="5506.45" dur="4.23">you take him to court and you get your</text>
  <text start="5507.98" dur="4.02">stuff back mm-hmm that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s all</text>
  <text start="5510.68" dur="3.45">we&amp;#39;re doing in the courts of heaven is</text>
  <text start="5512" dur="4.83">we&amp;#39;re just a pre Henning these stupid</text>
  <text start="5514.13" dur="3.87">demons who think can go and you know put</text>
  <text start="5516.83" dur="4.83">all this stuff on us we take them to</text>
  <text start="5518" dur="5.37">court and say no just judge what is she</text>
  <text start="5521.66" dur="4.89">sentencing with whatever you think is</text>
  <text start="5523.37" dur="5.73">good and I want my stuff back they they</text>
  <text start="5526.55" dur="4.92">literally have nothing so with that</text>
  <text start="5529.1" dur="4.68">information I always make my stand coz</text>
  <text start="5531.47" dur="3.66">they&amp;#39;re going to come they&amp;#39;re gonna come</text>
  <text start="5533.78" dur="2.88">because they&amp;#39;re gonna still try to</text>
  <text start="5535.13" dur="4.29">enforce what they believe they have a</text>
  <text start="5536.66" dur="4.23">right to and so for us if we don&amp;#39;t know</text>
  <text start="5539.42" dur="4.35">our rights then we don&amp;#39;t stand and</text>
  <text start="5540.89" dur="5.25">especially like we with it in healing</text>
  <text start="5543.77" dur="3.87">ministry but God doesn&amp;#39;t promise us</text>
  <text start="5546.14" dur="3.9">we&amp;#39;re always gonna pray for people that</text>
  <text start="5547.64" dur="3.6">are non-contagious so what do you do</text>
  <text start="5550.04" dur="3.51">when you have to pray for somebody</text>
  <text start="5551.24" dur="4.8">that&amp;#39;s contagious you ready will be</text>
  <text start="5553.55" dur="4.5">inclined not to like Jesus had the</text>
  <text start="5556.04" dur="4.29">clintons leprosy but that was contagious</text>
  <text start="5558.05" dur="6.81">it was highly contagious and it was a</text>
  <text start="5560.33" dur="6.36">gross disease and so and at one and so</text>
  <text start="5564.86" dur="3.96">for people who want to operate in Hill</text>
  <text start="5566.69" dur="5.4">it&amp;#39;s almost imperative that they</text>
  <text start="5568.82" dur="6.78">understand they&amp;#39;re right because they</text>
  <text start="5572.09" dur="5.16">will they will try to attack they will</text>
  <text start="5575.6" dur="3.75">try to intimidate you we&amp;#39;re gonna make</text>
  <text start="5577.25" dur="3.69">you sick too with they want to try to do</text>
  <text start="5579.35" dur="4.47">that so you have to stand your ground</text>

  <text start="5805.85" dur="4.26">fear like their mouth is saying one</text>
  <text start="5808.46" dur="4.92">thing but their spirit is saying</text>
  <text start="5810.11" dur="5.129">something else and nothing changes and</text>
  <text start="5813.38" dur="3.6">it don&amp;#39;t change because they know what</text>
  <text start="5815.239" dur="4.231">they&amp;#39;re thinking and they only gonna</text>
  <text start="5816.98" dur="4.92">respond what you believe</text>

  <text start="5826.13" dur="4.62">and they will only respond one of the</text>
  <text start="5829.13" dur="4.31">things I learned from them attacking me</text>
  <text start="5830.75" dur="6.81">those early years is they will only</text>
  <text start="5833.44" dur="5.77">respond to Authority they as long they</text>
  <text start="5837.56" dur="3">know where you are afraid and because I</text>
  <text start="5839.21" dur="3.66">was afraid that&amp;#39;s why they were</text>
  <text start="5840.56" dur="6.929">attacking me and they were attacking me</text>
  <text start="5842.87" dur="7.47">like every week for months for months so</text>
  <text start="5847.489" dur="4.561">much so that I was 21 I was still at</text>
  <text start="5850.34" dur="3.24">home I was running up my parents -</text>
  <text start="5852.05" dur="3.66">lettering bill they were gonna kick me</text>
  <text start="5853.58" dur="5.55">out because I was here to turn off the</text>
  <text start="5855.71" dur="4.29">light as long as I was afraid they</text>
  <text start="5859.13" dur="3.12">attacked me</text>
  <text start="5860" dur="4.77">the demons knew you were afraid they</text>
  <text start="5862.25" dur="4.23">sensed fear and as long as they knew you</text>
  <text start="5864.77" dur="2.969">were afraid they knew they had they</text>
  <text start="5866.48" dur="3.18">could just do whatever they wanted with</text>
  <text start="5867.739" dur="4.801">you and they were like dogs and he they</text>
  <text start="5869.66" dur="4.05">were on me and once I started and this</text>
  <text start="5872.54" dur="4.68">way that goes back to where we started</text>
  <text start="5873.71" dur="5.25">with trust once I started to say the</text>
  <text start="5877.22" dur="3.72">name of Jesus and they were back off and</text>
  <text start="5878.96" dur="3.93">once I begin to realize hey hold on</text>
  <text start="5880.94" dur="4.41">there there&amp;#39;s something here then that</text>
  <text start="5882.89" dur="6.39">was like oh I have authority in that</text>
  <text start="5885.35" dur="5.61">thing once I got that oh nothing nothing</text>
  <text start="5889.28" dur="3.6">it didn&amp;#39;t matter then it was then it was</text>
  <text start="5890.96" dur="4.44">game on for you anymore</text>
  <text start="5892.88" dur="7.05">and that&amp;#39;s why Jesus told his disciples</text>
  <text start="5895.4" dur="6.69">I give you authority over the power</text>
  <text start="5899.93" dur="5.13">the enemy right because the power that</text>
  <text start="5902.09" dur="6.3">the enemy has the enemy has power but</text>
  <text start="5905.06" dur="6.02">what the enemy doesn&amp;#39;t have is Authority</text>
  <text start="5908.39" dur="7.2">so our authority Trump&amp;#39;s their power</text>
  <text start="5911.08" dur="6.01">every time every time so that&amp;#39;s how I</text>
  <text start="5915.59" dur="4.29">make my stand like when they come around</text>
  <text start="5917.09" dur="4.89">and and because I get to see him when</text>
  <text start="5919.88" dur="4.41">they come around I can see him so my</text>
  <text start="5921.98" dur="3.36">daughter could see him too so she knows</text>
  <text start="5924.29" dur="3.03">that someone who wants their cold</text>
  <text start="5925.34" dur="3.87">allergies and some of the other ones not</text>
  <text start="5927.32" dur="3.33">tell you demons aren&amp;#39;t feeling it</text>
  <text start="5929.21" dur="3.78">because if two things left to think</text>
  <text start="5930.65" dur="4.98">demons and sickness I mean demons that</text>
  <text start="5932.99" dur="4.26">or demons is sickness but they all</text>
  <text start="5935.63" dur="4.29">related they caught they can bring them</text>
  <text start="5937.25" dur="5.25">they can cause them the demon is not the</text>
  <text start="5939.92" dur="4.74">sickness itself the demon causes the</text>
  <text start="5942.5" dur="4.17">condition somehow and I don&amp;#39;t understand</text>
  <text start="5944.66" dur="4.32">how this works but you know like demons</text>
  <text start="5946.67" dur="5.73">that cause seizures or demons that cause</text>
  <text start="5948.98" dur="6.21">asthma there they don&amp;#39;t actually have</text>
  <text start="5952.4" dur="5.22">the physical sickness themselves the</text>
  <text start="5955.19" dur="2.97">demon is the sickness it causes it in</text>
  <text start="5957.62" dur="3.36">your body</text>
  <text start="5958.16" dur="5.82">it sets up a situation where that</text>
  <text start="5960.98" dur="4.86">condition happens in your body hard to</text>
  <text start="5963.98" dur="4.62">describe it that&amp;#39;s what happens because</text>
  <text start="5965.84" dur="4.59">I think they want one way they set up</text>
  <text start="5968.6" dur="3.27">condition and then one of the things Gus</text>
  <text start="5970.43" dur="4.17">taught how to talk to me about it the</text>
  <text start="5971.87" dur="6.21">practical side it&amp;#39;s like when I hurt my</text>
  <text start="5974.6" dur="5.4">back legitimately hurt my back and when</text>
  <text start="5978.08" dur="4.5">I was taking my karateka it was the</text>
  <text start="5980" dur="4.95">legitimate injury and I was strengthened</text>
  <text start="5982.58" dur="4.74">this and did the exercises and got it</text>
  <text start="5984.95" dur="4.77">all together but one day I&amp;#39;m walking</text>
  <text start="5987.32" dur="4.89">around with shoveling snow that year and</text>
  <text start="5989.72" dur="4.5">I thought I&amp;#39;ve hurt my back again but I</text>
  <text start="5992.21" dur="5.43">notice there&amp;#39;s something running around</text>
  <text start="5994.22" dur="5.73">that the ran ran into the roof I say</text>
  <text start="5997.64" dur="4.98">this is a spirit of pain but it&amp;#39;s spirit</text>
  <text start="5999.95" dur="5.16">of pain get out of here and so he left</text>
  <text start="6002.62" dur="4.41">and the pain went and so sometimes they</text>
  <text start="6005.11" dur="2.61">take advantages of injuries that are</text>
  <text start="6007.03" dur="3.69">already there</text>
  <text start="6007.72" dur="5.4">oh yeah that&amp;#39;s classic after Denise got</text>

  <text start="6024.94" dur="4.68">pain and would come back and she knew it</text>
  <text start="6027.4" dur="4.38">was a demon so she would just rebuke the</text>
  <text start="6029.62" dur="3.75">spirit of pain commanded to leave and</text>
  <text start="6031.78" dur="3.39">the pain would go man</text>
  <text start="6033.37" dur="3.12">you know five or six hours later would</text>
