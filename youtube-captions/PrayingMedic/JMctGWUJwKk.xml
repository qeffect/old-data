  <text start="62.55" dur="5.28">those days in my spirit and they shall</text>
  <text start="64.83" dur="6.45">prophesy so we talked yesterday about</text>
  <text start="67.83" dur="5.01">visions visions are prophesied we talked</text>
  <text start="71.28" dur="3.269">about Kenneth E Hagin in his book I</text>
  <text start="72.84" dur="4.56">believe in visions which is in our offer</text>
  <text start="74.549" dur="5.07">and then I told you about this young man</text>
  <text start="77.4" dur="4.469">named Max and that I&amp;#39;d found out about</text>
  <text start="79.619" dur="6.211">visions years ago and that&amp;#39;s why when</text>
  <text start="81.869" dur="6.96">this young former Muslim muhanad was his</text>
  <text start="85.83" dur="4.62">name when he asked me to he was born</text>
  <text start="88.829" dur="3.741">again supernaturally like so many</text>
  <text start="90.45" dur="4.29">Muslims are by hearing the voice of God</text>
  <text start="92.57" dur="4.75">and then he began to have open eyed</text>
  <text start="94.74" dur="4.68">visions of Jesus he made a trip all the</text>
  <text start="97.32" dur="4.83">way from Wisconsin with his Christian</text>
  <text start="99.42" dur="7.35">wife and his children and asked me if I</text>
  <text start="102.15" dur="8.609">would judge those visions so excuse me</text>
  <text start="106.77" dur="5.459">he he began to call me and periodically</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="3.661">Jesus would appear to him open eyed</text>
  <text start="112.229" dur="4.981">visions and it would often be something</text>
  <text start="114.42" dur="4.44">about for instance Isis he was one of</text>
  <text start="117.21" dur="4.38">the first ones that I heard about talk</text>
  <text start="118.86" dur="5.219">about Isis and Jesus had told him that</text>
  <text start="121.59" dur="4.169">what their plans were how they plan to</text>
  <text start="124.079" dur="3.241">start any rock come down through how</text>
  <text start="125.759" dur="4.051">they even plan to go to Mecca and Medina</text>
  <text start="127.32" dur="4.59">and how they plan to come down through</text>
  <text start="129.81" dur="3.45">Jordan and then to Jerusalem but Jesus</text>
  <text start="131.91" dur="1.95">said they won&amp;#39;t be able to do it don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="133.26" dur="5.82">be able to get</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="8.49">none so max he asked me to judge his</text>
  <text start="139.08" dur="6.48">visions I taught him how to judge</text>
  <text start="142.35" dur="6.99">visions himself so he learned to do that</text>
  <text start="145.56" dur="6.75">and then in September 20th 2016 the Lord</text>
  <text start="149.34" dur="4.32">Jesus appeared to him and said Donald</text>
  <text start="152.31" dur="4.08">Trump will be the next president of the</text>
  <text start="153.66" dur="5.55">United States so he shared that with me</text>
  <text start="156.39" dur="6.21">and I&amp;#39;ll read some of the things he said</text>
  <text start="159.21" dur="5.749">that Jesus told him I&amp;#39;ve been preparing</text>
  <text start="162.6" dur="4.71">him to be the president since 2008 in</text>
  <text start="164.959" dur="5.021">2011 he was not ready for the 2012</text>
  <text start="167.31" dur="5.25">campaign in 2013 he became closer to me</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="5.07">in 2015 I guided him to run for</text>
  <text start="172.56" dur="4.53">president he&amp;#39;s going to have a lot of</text>
  <text start="175.05" dur="3.47">negativity and a rough road but he will</text>
  <text start="177.09" dur="4.2">be the president of the United States</text>
  <text start="178.52" dur="5.59">primarily because he is the one who will</text>
  <text start="181.29" dur="3.93">be protecting the USA Israel and</text>
  <text start="184.11" dur="4.32">Jerusalem</text>
  <text start="185.22" dur="5.16">praise God Jesus told him we talked</text>
  <text start="188.43" dur="4.17">about this on the phone with him he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="190.38" dur="5.43">the chosen one because he will protect</text>
  <text start="192.6" dur="5.46">Jerusalem then jesus said to young</text>
  <text start="195.81" dur="3.929">people will be shocked Donald Trump is</text>
  <text start="198.06" dur="4.08">closer to me now than anybody could</text>
  <text start="199.739" dur="6.631">imagine I shared that with my family I</text>
  <text start="202.14" dur="6.42">urged the prayers to pray on October</text>
  <text start="206.37" dur="4.83">2016 which is just before the election</text>
  <text start="208.56" dur="3.989">he had another open-eyed vision the Lord</text>
  <text start="211.2" dur="3.9">spoke to him and said he will be the</text>
  <text start="212.549" dur="4.981">president but my children must stand</text>
  <text start="215.1" dur="5.85">together and pray for him like they have</text>
  <text start="217.53" dur="6.709">never prayed for a president before so</text>
  <text start="220.95" dur="5.91">we have to do Timothy first Timothy 2:1</text>
  <text start="224.239" dur="4.181">first of all we have to pray for</text>
  <text start="226.86" dur="4.14">presidents and Kings and those in</text>
  <text start="228.42" dur="4.47">authority every single day devote</text>
  <text start="231" dur="4.049">yourself to pray for our government if</text>
  <text start="232.89" dur="4.14">we done that before our presidents would</text>
  <text start="235.049" dur="4.171">have done better but this time we have</text>
  <text start="237.03" dur="4.41">to do now the day before the election it</text>
  <text start="239.22" dur="5.97">absolutely looked like trunk could not</text>
  <text start="241.44" dur="6.42">win every poll city did not win and Maxo</text>
  <text start="245.19" dur="6.21">me he said I got down on my knees I said</text>
  <text start="247.86" dur="5.55">Lord and he showed me a vision this time</text>
  <text start="251.4" dur="5.67">the vision was not of Jesus but it was</text>
  <text start="253.41" dur="8.46">up these two V&amp;#39;s together all over the</text>
  <text start="257.07" dur="7.05">sky the Mac said V in Arabic is seven so</text>
  <text start="261.87" dur="4.02">I thought he was doing 77 s all over the</text>
  <text start="264.12" dur="3.24">sky because you know seven is a number</text>
  <text start="265.89" dur="2.91">in the Bible but</text>
  <text start="267.36" dur="4.29">you spoke to him then he said no this is</text>
  <text start="268.8" dur="6.72">in English this these are these for</text>
  <text start="271.65" dur="5.489">victory he will have a double victory so</text>
  <text start="275.52" dur="3.75">all over the sky were these double</text>
  <text start="277.139" dur="3.3">victories so I was scheduled to be on</text>
  <text start="279.27" dur="3.389">Casey Emma&amp;#39;s election night coverage</text>
  <text start="280.439" dur="3.841">with David Barton David Barton and</text>
  <text start="282.659" dur="4.35">Michelle Bachman I was just a telephone</text>
  <text start="284.28" dur="5.639">call in but they asked me what I thought</text>
  <text start="287.009" dur="4.891">would happen so I had to go but I</text>
  <text start="289.919" dur="5.22">believed these visions but the polls</text>
  <text start="291.9" dur="5.639">that otherwise so just as just as much</text>
  <text start="295.139" dur="5.721">as I could I I said I believe Trump will</text>
  <text start="297.539" dur="6.421">win and on January 14 after he did win</text>
  <text start="300.86" dur="4.779">the Lord spoke to him the last few days</text>
  <text start="303.96" dur="3.929">before he takes office it will be very</text>
  <text start="305.639" dur="3.691">hard for him hard on his heart and hard</text>
  <text start="307.889" dur="3.511">on his mind but he will make it</text>
  <text start="309.33" dur="5.639">Christians must stand together and pray</text>
  <text start="311.4" dur="5.489">daily so we have to pray now I believe I</text>
  <text start="314.969" dur="4.47">don&amp;#39;t know you know if you believe not</text>
  <text start="316.889" dur="4.56">necessarily the authority around here</text>
  <text start="319.439" dur="6.57">believes this is Donald J Trump but I do</text>
  <text start="321.449" dur="6.69">I believe that brother Hagin prophesied</text>
  <text start="326.009" dur="4.741">he would there would be a president and</text>
  <text start="328.139" dur="4.65">I think it&amp;#39;s known J Trump now he</text>
  <text start="330.75" dur="5.339">prophesied we mentally reading this long</text>
  <text start="332.789" dur="6.451">not prophecy he prophesied brother Hagin</text>
  <text start="336.089" dur="5.101">prophesied in 1974 there&amp;#39;s going to be a</text>
  <text start="339.24" dur="3.829">move of the Spirit in the last days</text>
  <text start="341.19" dur="4.199">which you&amp;#39;ve only seen a little of and</text>
  <text start="343.069" dur="3.85">there shall be those that stand before</text>
  <text start="345.389" dur="4.321">the leaders of this nation and work</text>
  <text start="346.919" dur="4.831">miracles I believe we have leaders in</text>
  <text start="349.71" dur="5.4">these nations who would accept miracles</text>
  <text start="351.75" dur="5.729">and you know the Bible says as far as</text>
  <text start="355.11" dur="4.799">Mack seeing that Donald Trump is going</text>
  <text start="357.479" dur="4.321">to be elected the Bible says in John 16</text>
  <text start="359.909" dur="3.901">the Holy Spirit shall show you things to</text>
  <text start="361.8" dur="4.38">come right that&amp;#39;s right so he&amp;#39;s showing</text>
  <text start="363.81" dur="5.719">people things to come these these things</text>
  <text start="366.18" dur="6.03">are happening now</text>
  <text start="369.529" dur="6.81">bless the Lord I believe this part of</text>
  <text start="372.21" dur="8.009">the prophecy which is on page 2 it says</text>
  <text start="376.339" dur="5.29">let not your heart be fearful here for</text>
  <text start="380.219" dur="4.32">there shall and on the scene he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="381.629" dur="5.04">already arisen one who shall responded</text>
  <text start="384.539" dur="4.891">to the things of God and whose heart</text>
  <text start="386.669" dur="4.351">will be open toward God and your nation</text>
  <text start="389.43" dur="4.019">that seemed to be cut down to the roots</text>
  <text start="391.02" dur="3.929">and the wild birds of the air and the</text>
  <text start="393.449" dur="4.351">fowls of the air came Andrew stood in</text>
  <text start="394.949" dur="5.161">her branches and did much disrepute into</text>
  <text start="397.8" dur="3.18">the nation yet that shall all be</text>
  <text start="400.11" dur="3.87">repaired</text>
  <text start="400.98" dur="5.7">because this man shall say I will walk</text>
  <text start="403.98" dur="5.94">in the way of God I will trust also in</text>
  <text start="406.68" dur="5.07">him he shall be at the head and many</text>
  <text start="409.92" dur="4.74">shall follow him so he&amp;#39;s a head of the</text>
  <text start="411.75" dur="4.71">nation I believe and the work of God</text>
  <text start="414.66" dur="3.75">shall be consummated that must be</text>
  <text start="416.46" dur="5.43">consummated even in other nations before</text>
  <text start="418.41" dur="6.12">I come I heard him say God&amp;#39;s name</text>
  <text start="421.89" dur="4.08">because you see the enemy shall not</text>
  <text start="424.53" dur="3.66">gainsay the work of the Lord that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="425.97" dur="3.93">right and like a trumpet sounding across</text>
  <text start="428.19" dur="3.9">the valley I heard his voice so strong</text>
  <text start="429.9" dur="4.62">and clear and he said I&amp;#39;m not coming for</text>
  <text start="432.09" dur="4.92">a church the body of Christ that is weak</text>
  <text start="434.52" dur="4.41">emaciated sickly and underground I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="437.01" dur="4.71">coming for the spiritual giant that&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="438.93" dur="5.46">alive and living and working the works</text>
  <text start="441.72" dur="5.31">of God so he prophesied there&amp;#39;ll be this</text>
  <text start="444.39" dur="5.04">leader people will work miracles before</text>
  <text start="447.03" dur="5.01">the leaders and then the church is just</text>
  <text start="449.43" dur="4.38">going to be this glorious Church now in</text>
  <text start="452.04" dur="5.69">this same prophecy and today we&amp;#39;re going</text>
  <text start="453.81" dur="8.19">to talk about translations in this same</text>
  <text start="457.73" dur="6.64">prophecy brother Hagin prophesied that</text>
  <text start="462" dur="5.73">it shall be even so as it was with</text>
  <text start="464.37" dur="5.85">Philip after that he had baptized the</text>
  <text start="467.73" dur="5.19">eunuch but he was caught away and found</text>
  <text start="470.22" dur="4.47">in another city and so one shall be in</text>
  <text start="472.92" dur="3.9">this city and television cameras shall</text>
  <text start="474.69" dur="5.64">be trained upon him and reporters will</text>
  <text start="476.82" dur="5.31">say he&amp;#39;s here in Dallas Texas but as</text>
  <text start="480.33" dur="4.29">fast as you can snap your finger a</text>
  <text start="482.13" dur="5.52">television camera in Los Angeles was</text>
  <text start="484.62" dur="6.03">pick him up and he&amp;#39;ll be there and some</text>
  <text start="487.65" dur="4.95">will say how did he do that and it shall</text>
  <text start="490.65" dur="4.14">be the Spirit of the Lord that shall</text>
  <text start="492.6" dur="4.08">catch him away I didn&amp;#39;t say this is</text>
  <text start="494.79" dur="4.62">going to happen right now he prophesied</text>
  <text start="496.68" dur="5.13">in 1974 but these signs and wonders</text>
  <text start="499.41" dur="4.11">shall become more prevalent signs and</text>
  <text start="501.81" dur="3.6">wonders have come here and come there</text>
  <text start="503.52" dur="4.77">but they shall be prevalent and more</text>
  <text start="505.41" dur="4.71">prevalent in the last days and then he</text>
  <text start="508.29" dur="4.08">prophesized about that leader so</text>
  <text start="510.12" dur="4.83">connected with this time I believe of</text>
  <text start="512.37" dur="5.549">our having a new leader also these times</text>
  <text start="514.95" dur="5.279">of a translation phrase so now Acts</text>

  <text start="717.04" dur="6.93">that dump it looked like clear sailing</text>
  <text start="719.939" dur="6.25">almost like the Red Sea being parted and</text>
  <text start="723.97" dur="4.589">even our taxi driver who is not really</text>
  <text start="726.189" dur="4.411">religious oh no not at all he said this</text>
  <text start="728.559" dur="4.441">is a mineral called innocent miracle and</text>
  <text start="730.6" dur="4.32">he kept saying ladies look at this watch</text>

  <text start="734.92" dur="5.099">traffix was all Hong Kong Hong Kong but</text>
  <text start="737.17" dur="4.769">we seemingly were moving in a string of</text>
  <text start="740.019" dur="3.721">traffic just fine and there was plenty</text>
  <text start="741.939" dur="4.65">of space apprentices and plenty of face</text>
  <text start="743.74" dur="5.88">space behind us and next thing you know</text>
  <text start="746.589" dur="4.92">we were at the airport it didn&amp;#39;t take us</text>
  <text start="749.62" dur="4.8">as much time to get to the airport as it</text>
  <text start="751.509" dur="4.68">normally did we were translated he was</text>
  <text start="754.42" dur="4.019">overcome he said this is a miracle this</text>
  <text start="756.189" dur="4.471">is a miracle and he got out and got all</text>
  <text start="758.439" dur="4.71">of our bags and took us to the plane so</text>
  <text start="760.66" dur="4.229">we got translated and we knew it but</text>
  <text start="763.149" dur="3.36">sometimes you get translated and you</text>
  <text start="764.889" dur="3.75">don&amp;#39;t know it and I want you to tell</text>
  <text start="766.509" dur="4.92">about that time okay that happened with</text>
  <text start="768.639" dur="5.731">you well at the time I was 27 years old</text>
  <text start="771.429" dur="4.741">and wife and mother of two little</text>
  <text start="774.37" dur="4.05">children and I&amp;#39;ve been used to</text>
  <text start="776.17" dur="3.839">travelling for the Lord and now the kids</text>
  <text start="778.42" dur="3.69">are coming and there&amp;#39;s laundry and</text>
  <text start="780.009" dur="4.531">cooking and not so much traveling for</text>
  <text start="782.11" dur="4.229">God and I was had this little thought oh</text>
  <text start="784.54" dur="4.76">and I realize now it was the enemy</text>
  <text start="786.339" dur="5.97">you&amp;#39;re not praying for people enough</text>
  <text start="789.3" dur="4.539">preaching and preaching enough and look</text>
  <text start="792.309" dur="3.811">what you&amp;#39;re doing you&amp;#39;re taking care of</text>
  <text start="793.839" dur="3.99">these kids and of course that&amp;#39;s the</text>
  <text start="796.12" dur="4.829">highest thing to do being a mother and</text>
  <text start="797.829" dur="3.721">training them to be to know God but</text>
  <text start="800.949" dur="1.171">anyway</text>
  <text start="801.55" dur="3.389">the end</text>
  <text start="802.12" dur="5.639">and so one night I just laid my head on</text>
  <text start="804.939" dur="5.58">the pillow and I said Lord use me for</text>
  <text start="807.759" dur="8.401">your glory and the next thing you know</text>
  <text start="810.519" dur="8.31">I&amp;#39;m in this home and every detail I saw</text>
  <text start="816.16" dur="5.76">the man of the home he was shoveling</text>
  <text start="818.829" dur="6.091">ashes out of a blond brick fireplace I</text>
  <text start="821.92" dur="5.49">saw his wife on the couch and her sister</text>
  <text start="824.92" dur="4.649">I saw him make a cup of caught by pot of</text>
  <text start="827.41" dur="3.839">coffee actually open concept with the</text>
  <text start="829.569" dur="5.46">bar and then they&amp;#39;re enjoying their</text>
  <text start="831.249" dur="7.041">coffee and I&amp;#39;m thinking this is not</text>
  <text start="835.029" dur="6">strange I&amp;#39;m and all of a sudden I saw</text>
  <text start="838.29" dur="5.64">Jesus and I said Lord what do you want</text>
  <text start="841.029" dur="5.61">me to do why am I here and he said pray</text>
  <text start="843.93" dur="4.779">and so I just laid my hands out like</text>
  <text start="846.639" dur="4.831">this they couldn&amp;#39;t see me and I just</text>
  <text start="848.709" dur="5.55">began to pray in other tongues and then</text>
  <text start="851.47" dur="4.529">after a while it was over so I told my</text>
  <text start="854.259" dur="4.05">husband the next morning and of course</text>
  <text start="855.999" dur="4.231">now he&amp;#39;s in heaven but we made a vow to</text>
  <text start="858.309" dur="4.231">each other that we would never tell a</text>
  <text start="860.23" dur="4.95">soul what happened because he didn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="862.54" dur="5.899">want people to think I was crazy I can</text>
  <text start="865.18" dur="6.719">understand you can understand that oh</text>
  <text start="868.439" dur="6.76">now he&amp;#39;s in heaven I can tell so this is</text>
  <text start="871.899" dur="6.24">what happened a few months later we are</text>
  <text start="875.199" dur="4.531">in a camp beating several thousand</text>
  <text start="878.139" dur="6.211">people for their higgins brother how you</text>
  <text start="879.73" dur="8.279">know Jenny and Martha and I have my baby</text>
  <text start="884.35" dur="5.489">he&amp;#39;s about nine months old Cody and have</text>
  <text start="888.009" dur="4.981">Kiley by the hand and we&amp;#39;re trying to</text>
  <text start="889.839" dur="5.91">find a place to sit my husband is trying</text>
  <text start="892.99" dur="5.149">to park the car and all of a sudden all</text>
  <text start="895.749" dur="4.921">these people time get a good spot and</text>
  <text start="898.139" dur="4.75">someone pushes me from behind and I</text>
  <text start="900.67" dur="4.38">almost fall and I&amp;#39;m thinking well</text>
  <text start="902.889" dur="3.51">someone fall at the devil I&amp;#39;m going to</text>
  <text start="905.05" dur="3.209">have to cast the devil out so I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="906.399" dur="4.74">turning around to say in the name of</text>
  <text start="908.259" dur="5.94">Jesus come out but instead I see this</text>
  <text start="911.139" dur="5.731">man who was cleaning his fireplace</text>
  <text start="914.199" dur="6.18">whose home I had been in in the spirit</text>
  <text start="916.87" dur="5.009">and he said mail who are you my wife and</text>
  <text start="920.379" dur="4.14">I&amp;#39;ve been watching you get up and down</text>
  <text start="921.879" dur="4.62">with the baby and our hearts burn we</text>
  <text start="924.519" dur="5.731">sense that we know you have you ever</text>
  <text start="926.499" dur="5.64">been to Alabama well the funny thing is</text>
  <text start="930.25" dur="3.74">I told my husband when it happened I</text>
  <text start="932.139" dur="4.611">knew I was in the state of</text>
  <text start="933.99" dur="6.93">that&amp;#39;s all I knew and he said well we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="936.75" dur="6.24">praying for you and be blessed and so it</text>
  <text start="940.92" dur="5.19">happened and then a few months later</text>
  <text start="942.99" dur="5.67">after that is when the Lord launched the</text>
  <text start="946.11" dur="5.25">ministry in Alabama and mom you may not</text>
  <text start="948.66" dur="6">know this but this ring I&amp;#39;m wearing was</text>
  <text start="951.36" dur="5.15">given by sister Lynn Hammond and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="954.66" dur="4.71">the first time I really met her and she</text>
  <text start="956.51" dur="6.19">began to pray and weep and it was right</text>
  <text start="959.37" dur="4.89">when our dad my dad your husband went to</text>
  <text start="962.7" dur="4.05">be with the lord but by the holy spirit</text>
  <text start="964.26" dur="4.59">he began to show us things and prepared</text>
  <text start="966.75" dur="4.5">our heart Alabama has always had a</text>
  <text start="968.85" dur="6.27">special place but the thing that I take</text>
  <text start="971.25" dur="7.68">away from this was God can use us even</text>
  <text start="975.12" dur="5.97">beyond our limitations sure you know we</text>
  <text start="978.93" dur="5.49">are a spirit created in his we&amp;#39;re pretty</text>
  <text start="981.09" dur="4.14">much always beyond limit and yeah she</text>
  <text start="984.42" dur="3.45">said it girl</text>
  <text start="985.23" dur="4.83">and so those people somehow sensed you</text>
  <text start="987.87" dur="5.25">were there they did and you you</text>
  <text start="990.06" dur="5.19">recognize them but something in the</text>
  <text start="993.12" dur="4.23">spirit told them that you were there yes</text>
  <text start="995.25" dur="4.41">now Gloria</text>
  <text start="997.35" dur="5.55">there was a lady came out to prayer</text>
  <text start="999.66" dur="6.12">Mountain I don&amp;#39;t know been a year or so</text>
  <text start="1002.9" dur="6.06">ago and she said I had to come and tell</text>
  <text start="1005.78" dur="6.83">you this she said I was in the hospital</text>
  <text start="1008.96" dur="7.59">I think she said stage 4 cancer and</text>
  <text start="1012.61" dur="6.48">there was no hope for me and she said</text>
  <text start="1016.55" dur="5.37">you I came to thank you</text>
  <text start="1019.09" dur="7.36">because you and Gloria came to pray for</text>
  <text start="1021.92" dur="5.99">all clearly and she said you walked up</text>
  <text start="1026.45" dur="6.27">to my bed she knew it was a translation</text>
  <text start="1027.91" dur="9.31">later on you walked up to my bed you</text>
  <text start="1032.72" dur="6.75">laid hands on me and you prayed and she</text>
  <text start="1037.22" dur="5.7">said I began to get better from that</text>
  <text start="1039.47" dur="7.47">hour now Gloria I remember that you used</text>
  <text start="1042.92" dur="7.77">to do regularly what Shelly did that</text>
  <text start="1046.94" dur="5.61">night when she said Lord yes me right</text>
  <text start="1050.69" dur="4.17">now take me take my life there&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="1052.55" dur="4.2">something with it you used to pray Lord</text>
  <text start="1054.86" dur="6.27">if you want to use me anywhere in the</text>
  <text start="1056.75" dur="6">Aral tonight use me so I figure it was</text>
  <text start="1061.13" dur="3.18">one of those my heart brain that against</text>
  <text start="1062.75" dur="3.57">and yeah I think I should also start</text>
  <text start="1064.31" dur="3.48">praying at again - it was one of those</text>
  <text start="1066.32" dur="3.63">nights I believe</text>
  <text start="1067.79" dur="4.62">that you were you and I were translated</text>
  <text start="1069.95" dur="4.8">to her and she literally came by for her</text>
  <text start="1072.41" dur="3.99">Mountain to thank me praise God even</text>
  <text start="1074.75" dur="4.05">though we did not know that God was</text>
  <text start="1076.4" dur="5.34">using us in this way and so I believe</text>
  <text start="1078.8" dur="5.28">that God can use you in that way</text>
  <text start="1081.74" dur="4.83">you know your spirit being can be</text>
  <text start="1084.08" dur="5.25">translated even without your body our</text>
  <text start="1086.57" dur="6.23">bodies were translated in Paris but her</text>
  <text start="1089.33" dur="7.62">spirit was translated to Alabama and</text>
