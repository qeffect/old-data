  <text start="30.06" dur="3.99">Texas is neat man I like the warmth</text>
  <text start="32.099" dur="5.611">actually it&amp;#39;s not as hot as I thought</text>
  <text start="34.05" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;d be but anyway what I wanted to do</text>
  <text start="37.71" dur="4.41">in this video is actually answer some</text>
  <text start="39.87" dur="3.57">questions that I&amp;#39;ve received from some</text>
  <text start="42.12" dur="3.06">of you guys I&amp;#39;m gonna start doing that</text>
  <text start="43.44" dur="5.57">some videos more just like kind of a Q&amp;amp;A</text>
  <text start="45.18" dur="7.17">style and in this one I got a question</text>
  <text start="49.01" dur="8.439">that I was going to answer and that</text>
  <text start="52.35" dur="7.56">comes from Mizzou GUI will say mizzu GUI</text>
  <text start="57.449" dur="3.781">he typed me and he wrote dear Jordan</text>
  <text start="59.91" dur="4.079">have you ever gone through an</text>
  <text start="61.23" dur="4.95">existential anks if yes how did you cope</text>
  <text start="63.989" dur="6.24">with it and then he goes on to ask me</text>
  <text start="66.18" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;ve been constantly asking myself every</text>
  <text start="70.229" dur="2.911">day</text>
  <text start="70.74" dur="4.169">I am walkabout existence I feel like</text>
  <text start="73.14" dur="4.47">this is some type of simulation in</text>
  <text start="74.909" dur="4.771">advanced civilization also having some</text>
  <text start="77.61" dur="4.98">kind of fear of afterlife in the</text>
  <text start="79.68" dur="4.86">weirdness of life and uncertainty of it</text>
  <text start="82.59" dur="6.48">all and all the possibilities that</text>
  <text start="84.54" dur="6.119">anybody can think of now so what I</text>
  <text start="89.07" dur="3.24">gather from this he&amp;#39;s basically asking</text>
  <text start="90.659" dur="5.311">me if obviously I&amp;#39;ve ever gone through</text>
  <text start="92.31" dur="5.25">some like existential crisis in my heart</text>
  <text start="95.97" dur="2.7">you know feeling like what the heck am I</text>
  <text start="97.56" dur="4.71">here what am i doing</text>
  <text start="98.67" dur="6.409">and absolutely I&amp;#39;ve absolutely gone</text>
  <text start="102.27" dur="5.76">through that and I think all of us have</text>
  <text start="105.079" dur="5.68">especially in the process of truth</text>
  <text start="108.03" dur="4.44">seeking because once you begin to come</text>
  <text start="110.759" dur="3.841">face-to-face with that illusion that</text>
  <text start="112.47" dur="4.35">we&amp;#39;ve been fed and you start to peer</text>
  <text start="114.6" dur="4.83">through it you can absolutely start</text>
  <text start="116.82" dur="4.86">getting a lot of inner tension and</text>
  <text start="119.43" dur="4.5">turmoil inner turmoil existential angst</text>
  <text start="121.68" dur="6.24">from all of that and that&amp;#39;s pretty much</text>
  <text start="123.93" dur="7.32">when I had my existential crisis per se</text>
  <text start="127.92" dur="5.52">I was about you know 20 21 when my first</text>
  <text start="131.25" dur="2.61">awakening process occurred and I came</text>
  <text start="133.44" dur="2.31">faced</text>
  <text start="133.86" dur="3.9">faced with that illusion and it sounds</text>
  <text start="135.75" dur="8.13">like from his question obviously I don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="137.76" dur="7.68">I don&amp;#39;t know where his mindset might be</text>
  <text start="143.88" dur="3.27">at I don&amp;#39;t know how far along in his</text>
  <text start="145.44" dur="4.11">awakening process it might be but having</text>
  <text start="147.15" dur="5.46">those questions to me sounds like he&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="149.55" dur="5.46">pretty near the beginning or you know</text>
  <text start="152.61" dur="4.8">slowly going through the rabbit holes</text>
  <text start="155.01" dur="4.29">one thing about my awakening process is</text>
  <text start="157.41" dur="5.43">I went through pretty much every single</text>
  <text start="159.3" dur="5.79">rabbit hole at once and it was very it</text>
  <text start="162.84" dur="4.92">was very traumatic you could say because</text>
  <text start="165.09" dur="4.89">you know be me being so young coming</text>
  <text start="167.76" dur="4.02">face to face with with the illusion per</text>
  <text start="169.98" dur="2.52">se and then peering through the whole</text>
  <text start="171.78" dur="2.67">thing</text>
  <text start="172.5" dur="3.78">some people take rabbit hole by rabbit</text>
  <text start="174.45" dur="6.18">hole and they ease themselves into it I</text>
  <text start="176.28" dur="9.87">just went balls deep right and that way</text>
  <text start="180.63" dur="7.77">I eye seeing the whole illusion all at</text>
  <text start="186.15" dur="4.47">once also young definitely put me</text>
  <text start="188.4" dur="7.2">through some existential angst and the</text>
  <text start="190.62" dur="6.75">way I coped with it is that honestly I</text>
  <text start="195.6" dur="5.07">smoked a lot of weed don&amp;#39;t recommend</text>
  <text start="197.37" dur="5.46">that at home kids I&amp;#39;m all for the plant</text>
  <text start="200.67" dur="4.77">but I&amp;#39;m not for that plant when it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="202.83" dur="7.59">used to run away from problems in masks</text>
  <text start="205.44" dur="7.41">pain so that was one way I coat which I</text>
  <text start="210.42" dur="6.24">don&amp;#39;t recommend but then there was also</text>
  <text start="212.85" dur="7.74">I just continued learning you know it</text>
  <text start="216.66" dur="7.17">was it was a process of wanting to share</text>
  <text start="220.59" dur="5.52">exactly this illusion I was seeing with</text>
  <text start="223.83" dur="5.159">everybody else and one thing that helped</text>
  <text start="226.11" dur="4.92">in my process of coping with this angst</text>
  <text start="228.989" dur="5.011">that I was working through was the</text>
  <text start="231.03" dur="5.13">ability to help people with it because</text>
  <text start="234" dur="4.23">conveniently at the same time I was</text>
  <text start="236.16" dur="4.049">learning about all the reality of what</text>
  <text start="238.23" dur="4.14">was going on in the world I worked at a</text>
  <text start="240.209" dur="8.491">health food store as well so I was able</text>
  <text start="242.37" dur="7.83">to take a lot of that drive to to show</text>
  <text start="248.7" dur="4.56">people the illusion and to really make a</text>
  <text start="250.2" dur="5.31">difference about it and put it into</text>
  <text start="253.26" dur="3.75">something useful I was I was learning</text>
  <text start="255.51" dur="2.88">all day at work so I was learning about</text>
  <text start="257.01" dur="3.81">what was going on and I was sharing that</text>
  <text start="258.39" dur="4.98">with a lot of people in regards to</text>
  <text start="260.82" dur="3.81">health but you know I would talk to</text>
  <text start="263.37" dur="4.44">people about all kinds of things when I</text>
  <text start="264.63" dur="7.23">was at that job so luckily I was able</text>
  <text start="267.81" dur="7.47">to take that inner angst and put it to</text>
  <text start="271.86" dur="6.27">use in helping people and you know maybe</text>
  <text start="275.28" dur="5.97">you don&amp;#39;t work at a job where you can do</text>
  <text start="278.13" dur="6">that maybe your creative passions will</text>
  <text start="281.25" dur="4.26">help you with that may help you outlet</text>
  <text start="284.13" dur="2.82">that angst in different ways maybe</text>
  <text start="285.51" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;re a painter maybe you&amp;#39;re creative</text>
  <text start="286.95" dur="6">really the best way to cope with it in</text>
  <text start="289.59" dur="5.79">my opinion is you know I could quote</text>
  <text start="292.95" dur="4.8">Joseph Campbell here and say follow your</text>
  <text start="295.38" dur="4.05">bliss my bliss was simply sharing</text>
  <text start="297.75" dur="3.66">everything I found out with other people</text>
  <text start="299.43" dur="2.94">that&amp;#39;s you know that I&amp;#39;m still doing</text>
  <text start="301.41" dur="3.36">that I&amp;#39;m still doing that with these</text>
  <text start="302.37" dur="4.74">YouTube channels and in any way you know</text>
  <text start="304.77" dur="4.14">any way I can whether it&amp;#39;s sharing</text>
  <text start="307.11" dur="4.08">information through video or writing</text>
  <text start="308.91" dur="4.17">articles or just posting rants on my</text>
  <text start="311.19" dur="3.51">facebook or what have you you know my</text>
  <text start="313.08" dur="4.92">bliss was sharing everything</text>
  <text start="314.7" dur="6.3">what&amp;#39;s your bliss right the best way to</text>
  <text start="318" dur="4.8">cope in to release inner tension is</text>
  <text start="321" dur="4.32">through creativity through an outlet</text>
  <text start="322.8" dur="5.16">where whatever that outlet might be my</text>
  <text start="325.32" dur="3.78">creativity was just amassing information</text>
  <text start="327.96" dur="5.459">and seeing how best I could talk about</text>
  <text start="329.1" dur="6.27">it that&amp;#39;s it you know I&amp;#39;m not as artsy</text>
  <text start="333.419" dur="3.87">as some people but maybe yours maybe you</text>
  <text start="335.37" dur="3.78">want to get a lot of that inner angst</text>
  <text start="337.289" dur="4.531">out through painting or through dance or</text>
  <text start="339.15" dur="4.98">through movement or music or whatever it</text>
  <text start="341.82" dur="4.77">is right as like I said Joseph Campbell</text>
  <text start="344.13" dur="6.57">says follow your bliss I love that love</text>
  <text start="346.59" dur="6.96">that statement from him and another</text>
  <text start="350.7" dur="5.15">thing you could think about another</text>
  <text start="353.55" dur="5.4">piece of advice I have to offer is</text>
  <text start="355.85" dur="6.46">resistance because there always seems to</text>
  <text start="358.95" dur="5.57">be this resistance to change and I think</text>
  <text start="362.31" dur="5.1">that&amp;#39;s what causes so much exercise</text>
  <text start="364.52" dur="5.64">existential angst when people come</text>
  <text start="367.41" dur="6.569">face-to-face with this illusion is that</text>
  <text start="370.16" dur="7">as much as someone might think that</text>
  <text start="373.979" dur="5.791">they&amp;#39;re open to change they&amp;#39;re really</text>
  <text start="377.16" dur="4.68">not they&amp;#39;re really not I&amp;#39;m you know I&amp;#39;m</text>
  <text start="379.77" dur="3.33">not open to change with so many things a</text>
  <text start="381.84" dur="3.06">lot of other people aren&amp;#39;t no matter how</text>
  <text start="383.1" dur="4.379">far along you are in your awakening</text>
  <text start="384.9" dur="5.329">process we all still have that ego that</text>
  <text start="387.479" dur="5.701">controls us we still have that ego that</text>
  <text start="390.229" dur="6.19">likes us to be in our comfort zones and</text>
  <text start="393.18" dur="5.1">doesn&amp;#39;t like change so a quote from</text>
  <text start="396.419" dur="5.161">Allen Watts here I mean I love Alan</text>
  <text start="398.28" dur="4.74">Watts he said simply don&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="401.58" dur="4.589">paraphrasing this one but don&amp;#39;t resist</text>
  <text start="403.02" dur="4.709">the change if you want to move with the</text>
  <text start="406.169" dur="4.111">change you have to plunge into it and</text>
  <text start="407.729" dur="6.051">join the dance and that&amp;#39;s exactly how it</text>
  <text start="410.28" dur="6.87">is is that you know once you start</text>
  <text start="413.78" dur="5.199">questioning your own existence what</text>
  <text start="417.15" dur="4.35">that&amp;#39;s essentially doing is that you&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="418.979" dur="7.051">resisting opening yourself up to a new</text>
  <text start="421.5" dur="6.81">existence you&amp;#39;re resisting breaking down</text>
  <text start="426.03" dur="4.97">the own old foundations of thought that</text>
  <text start="428.31" dur="4.829">you have in your psyche and it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="431" dur="5.02">becoming difficult for you to process</text>
  <text start="433.139" dur="5.551">new new forms of thought new ways of</text>
  <text start="436.02" dur="6.179">being and thinking so try not to resist</text>
  <text start="438.69" dur="5.699">man that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the best way I can</text>
  <text start="442.199" dur="5.731">that&amp;#39;s the best advice doc I can offer</text>
  <text start="444.389" dur="5.101">is don&amp;#39;t resist move through new thought</text>
  <text start="447.93" dur="4.59">processes move through all this</text>
  <text start="449.49" dur="4.38">information at your own speed it doesn&amp;#39;t</text>
  <text start="452.52" dur="3.149">have to be all at once it was all at</text>
  <text start="453.87" dur="6.69">once for me but it can be bit by bit for</text>
  <text start="455.669" dur="7.081">you but look to unlearn look to unlearn</text>
  <text start="460.56" dur="6.81">the old thought processes and build new</text>
  <text start="462.75" dur="8.19">ones and find a creative outlet that</text>
  <text start="467.37" dur="6.24">best serves you to help get a lot of</text>
  <text start="470.94" dur="4.949">that inner tension out also exercise</text>
  <text start="473.61" dur="5.399">exercise is a big one we tend to hold a</text>
  <text start="475.889" dur="5.7">lot of tension in our physical bodies so</text>
  <text start="479.009" dur="5.52">various bioenergetic practices would</text>
  <text start="481.589" dur="6.38">absolutely help you active meditation</text>
  <text start="484.529" dur="5.94">static meditation and creative outlets</text>
