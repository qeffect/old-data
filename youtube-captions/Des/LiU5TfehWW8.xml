  <text start="155.58" dur="5.35">get to this point yeah well that&amp;#39;s a</text>
  <text start="158.65" dur="5.37">great question I did a lot of face</text>
  <text start="160.93" dur="6.51">planting making a lot of mistakes and</text>
  <text start="164.02" dur="6.65">having my own shortcomings and so you</text>
  <text start="167.44" dur="6.269">know I I grew up you know I had a</text>
  <text start="170.67" dur="4.45">different lifestyle than most my parents</text>
  <text start="173.709" dur="5.491">were hippies I went out to the summer of</text>
  <text start="175.12" dur="6.69">love for 1967 in haight-ashbury San</text>
  <text start="179.2" dur="4.5">Francisco so my parents thought</text>
  <text start="181.81" dur="5.01">different therefore you know I kind of</text>
  <text start="183.7" dur="5.07">thought different I started hitchhiking</text>
  <text start="186.82" dur="4.35">when I was 12 I&amp;#39;ve been on my own so I</text>
  <text start="188.77" dur="3.87">was 14 I got incarcerated as a youth I</text>
  <text start="191.17" dur="4.73">got kicked out every school that I ever</text>
  <text start="192.64" dur="7.53">went to which is just you know my</text>
  <text start="195.9" dur="6.369">objection to Authority and so and then</text>
  <text start="200.17" dur="3.33">you know I straightened up my life there</text>
  <text start="202.269" dur="3.891">for a while and put myself through</text>
  <text start="203.5" dur="5.82">college and then I started modeling and</text>
  <text start="206.16" dur="5.59">and then some of my Arrested Development</text>
  <text start="209.32" dur="5.25">if you will I mean I started smoking pot</text>
  <text start="211.75" dur="5.489">when I was 12 I started drinking and and</text>
  <text start="214.57" dur="5.639">so I think some of the emotional rested</text>
  <text start="217.239" dur="7.261">development started to surface in my 20s</text>
  <text start="220.209" dur="5.791">and through anxiety and and other things</text>
  <text start="224.5" dur="4.019">that really just quelled it with alcohol</text>
  <text start="226" dur="4.26">and started drinking a lot a lot of</text>
  <text start="228.519" dur="4.47">alcohol and I was in industry I was in</text>
  <text start="230.26" dur="4.65">the fashion industry that was you know</text>
  <text start="232.989" dur="6.78">goes hand in hand with partying drugs</text>
  <text start="234.91" dur="8.88">alcohol nightclubs and so I got pretty</text>
  <text start="239.769" dur="7.651">deep into my own dysfunction trying to</text>
  <text start="243.79" dur="5.25">hide my own you know emotional trauma</text>
  <text start="247.42" dur="3.71">that I was dealing with I think we all</text>
  <text start="249.04" dur="4.5">have some form of you know trauma or</text>
  <text start="251.13" dur="4.75">emotions that need to be processed and</text>
  <text start="253.54" dur="4.169">so I went through that and and you know</text>
  <text start="255.88" dur="4.68">really got into drugs and alcohol and it</text>
  <text start="257.709" dur="4.331">was my friends that told me you know hey</text>
  <text start="260.56" dur="3.07">you got a lot of potential</text>
  <text start="262.04" dur="5.46">you know you&amp;#39;re wasting your potential</text>
  <text start="263.63" dur="5.19">so I started to go down the sober road</text>
  <text start="267.5" dur="3.48">and it took me about four and a half</text>
  <text start="268.82" dur="4.14">years to sober up and I moved to LA and</text>
  <text start="270.98" dur="4.85">I started acting and doing stand-up</text>
  <text start="272.96" dur="6.84">comedy and but I&amp;#39;ve been studying</text>
  <text start="275.83" dur="6.82">nutrition as a model I was sitting in</text>

  <text start="417.91" dur="6.55">working in the Amazon and understanding</text>
  <text start="420.979" dur="5.401">the environment helped me realize kind</text>
  <text start="424.46" dur="4.709">of where we were you know where we&amp;#39;re at</text>
  <text start="426.38" dur="7.009">as a species and it woke me up to how</text>

  <text start="588.71" dur="6.93">was 2005 this was just 2006 it was just</text>
  <text start="591.8" dur="6.87">post not far off from 9/11 it was you</text>
  <text start="595.64" dur="4.83">know the Iraq war was a few years in the</text>
  <text start="598.67" dur="3.18">making and it didn&amp;#39;t look and Bush was</text>
  <text start="600.47" dur="4.59">in power and it didn&amp;#39;t look like things</text>
  <text start="601.85" dur="5.82">were gonna get you know any better any</text>
  <text start="605.06" dur="4.59">time soon and I heard a plane going over</text>
  <text start="607.67" dur="3.99">and there was only one plane every two</text>
  <text start="609.65" dur="4.83">weeks coming from Brazil would go over</text>
  <text start="611.66" dur="4.74">Peru and I you know one thought led to</text>
  <text start="614.48" dur="3.66">the next I was laying in my hut you know</text>
  <text start="616.4" dur="4.35">in the middle of the jungle and I</text>
  <text start="618.14" dur="4.2">realized what if that plane had bombs on</text>
  <text start="620.75" dur="3.72">it and I&amp;#39;m like what what are the people</text>
  <text start="622.34" dur="4.11">in Iraq deal with getting bombed like</text>
  <text start="624.47" dur="3.3">that and then I was like and then I was</text>
  <text start="626.45" dur="3.03">thinking about George Bush and I was</text>
  <text start="627.77" dur="4.44">like oh my god everybody hates that guy</text>
  <text start="629.48" dur="6.87">and then I realized that guy needs love</text>
  <text start="632.21" dur="5.7">not hate and so and so I realized that</text>
  <text start="636.35" dur="4.02">you know it&amp;#39;s really about love and</text>
  <text start="637.91" dur="5.46">gratitude and not that I&amp;#39;m there every</text>
  <text start="640.37" dur="5.19">single moment of every day but we are</text>
  <text start="643.37" dur="4.04">going through an evolution I love how</text>
  <text start="645.56" dur="4.44">you touched on the Schumann resonance</text>
  <text start="647.41" dur="4.91">that resonates with my heart we are</text>
  <text start="650" dur="5.11">going through an evolution in</text>
  <text start="652.32" dur="5.31">in consciousness we we are evolving and</text>
  <text start="655.11" dur="4.2">so I think what&amp;#39;s-his-name Eckart Tolle</text>
  <text start="657.63" dur="5.13">talks about it in his book the new earth</text>
  <text start="659.31" dur="5.94">the the plants evolved into flowers the</text>
  <text start="662.76" dur="4.71">the stones evolved into crystals they</text>
  <text start="665.25" dur="4.5">say the dinosaurs evolved into birds and</text>
  <text start="667.47" dur="4.17">that human beings are here to evolve</text>
  <text start="669.75" dur="4.2">into our next stage of evolution and</text>
  <text start="671.64" dur="4.14">that is what&amp;#39;s happening and I see that</text>
  <text start="673.95" dur="5.16">crystallised because thirty years ago I</text>
  <text start="675.78" dur="6.45">started juicing now you can get a juice</text>
  <text start="679.11" dur="4.92">at one of ten organic juice bars in</text>
  <text start="682.23" dur="3.63">walking distance of my house</text>
  <text start="684.03" dur="3.44">before people were like juicing what is</text>
  <text start="685.86" dur="3.81">that what are you doing what you know</text>
  <text start="687.47" dur="4.93">why is that important now it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="689.67" dur="5.82">commonplace so consciousness is evolving</text>
  <text start="692.4" dur="5.94">people like Jordan are awakening at his</text>
  <text start="695.49" dur="5.04">age I mean I&amp;#39;m almost twenty twice his</text>
  <text start="698.34" dur="4.14">age or probably twice as age and you</text>
  <text start="700.53" dur="4.65">know to see young people awakening now</text>
  <text start="702.48" dur="5.55">that tells me that we&amp;#39;re right par on</text>
  <text start="705.18" dur="4.32">course for this evolutionary step that</text>
  <text start="708.03" dur="3.48">we&amp;#39;re going through and the machination</text>
  <text start="709.5" dur="6.6">of what he covers in the government are</text>
  <text start="711.51" dur="6.81">just simply the unraveling of this</text>
  <text start="716.1" dur="5.22">evolution the unraveling of the old</text>
  <text start="718.32" dur="4.8">paradigm of the old system and it is</text>
  <text start="721.32" dur="3.18">absolutely unraveling faster and faster</text>
  <text start="723.12" dur="3.09">faster I get this question all the time</text>
  <text start="724.5" dur="7.08">you know when&amp;#39;s it gonna break when&amp;#39;s it</text>
  <text start="726.21" dur="7.83">gonna break and I think it&amp;#39;s only gonna</text>
  <text start="731.58" dur="3.87">break as fast as we make it break you</text>
  <text start="734.04" dur="3.99">know it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a lot of people are</text>
  <text start="735.45" dur="4.95">expecting disclosure to come from the</text>
  <text start="738.03" dur="3.81">top down and that&amp;#39;s you can&amp;#39;t expect</text>
  <text start="740.4" dur="3.03">that there&amp;#39;s no there&amp;#39;s gonna be no</text>

  <text start="804.12" dur="6.36">start to find peace within myself to me</text>
  <text start="807.66" dur="4.619">that&amp;#39;s the first step an interesting</text>
  <text start="810.48" dur="4.95">crucial point I want to make though is</text>
  <text start="812.279" dur="7.081">just when you say loving someone that</text>
  <text start="815.43" dur="5.58">doesn&amp;#39;t mean that yeah I want him to get</text>

  <text start="829.29" dur="5.82">want their ego to be broken and and you</text>
  <text start="831.3" dur="7.13">know say love often comes in the form of</text>

  <text start="853.38" dur="5.069">need to get that swift kick in the ass</text>
  <text start="854.64" dur="6.18">to grow in as much as it it hurts us</text>
  <text start="858.449" dur="4.741">because it&amp;#39;s not fun to see them be in</text>
  <text start="860.82" dur="6.209">pain we got to understand that they need</text>

  <text start="878.91" dur="4.5">what&amp;#39;s happening look at my video I made</text>
  <text start="880.5" dur="7.47">on on 2012 back and I launched it just</text>
  <text start="883.41" dur="6.929">before that my end date and 2012 you</text>

  <text start="897.56" dur="7.87">chemicals everywhere and and we&amp;#39;re</text>
  <text start="902.13" dur="5.519">evolving guys the earth can&amp;#39;t take much</text>
  <text start="905.43" dur="5.61">more of what we&amp;#39;re doing so tectonic</text>
  <text start="907.649" dur="6.351">plates geologically historically move so</text>
  <text start="911.04" dur="6.299">at the bare minimum will scrap this</text>
  <text start="914" dur="4.83">experiment for the next experiment but</text>
  <text start="917.339" dur="3.111">we are evolving no matter what</text>
  <text start="918.83" dur="5.13">the question is do we want to evolve</text>
  <text start="920.45" dur="7.2">consciously and my answer is yes totally</text>
  <text start="923.96" dur="5.82">it&amp;#39;s pretty much that or not so it&amp;#39;s</text>
  <text start="927.65" dur="4.2">ride-or-die right now guys absolutely</text>

  <text start="931.85" dur="4.5">mean there there is a lot of darkness on</text>
  <text start="934.1" dur="4.56">this planet no doubt but at the very</text>
  <text start="936.35" dur="4.74">same time it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the pure law of</text>

  <text start="2726.63" dur="6.42">I&amp;#39;ve learned how to utilize herbs and I</text>
  <text start="2729.09" dur="6.12">and for the last at least about 12 years</text>
  <text start="2733.05" dur="5.91">I&amp;#39;ve been eating an organic diet when it</text>
  <text start="2735.21" dur="5.49">means the most - before 1997 you know</text>
  <text start="2738.96" dur="3.39">that&amp;#39;s when GMOs came online</text>

  <text start="2742.35" dur="7.17">getting used ubiquitously in farming and</text>
  <text start="2745.41" dur="5.64">so before then or even my great</text>
  <text start="2749.52" dur="7.74">grandparents they used to just call</text>
  <text start="2751.05" dur="8.82">organic food so so yeah it does it does</text>
  <text start="2757.26" dur="4.2">it show up in your biology you know what</text>
  <text start="2759.87" dur="3.69">you feed your cells affects you for the</text>
  <text start="2761.46" dur="4.86">next seven years you&amp;#39;re sent your cells</text>
  <text start="2763.56" dur="5.16">are constantly replicating and so it</text>
  <text start="2766.32" dur="5.79">makes a huge difference what do you feed</text>
  <text start="2768.72" dur="6.21">the body and ultimately it does show up</text>
  <text start="2772.11" dur="5.34">I learned about fasting and juice</text>
  <text start="2774.93" dur="4.62">cleansing because I was a model and my</text>
  <text start="2777.45" dur="3.84">career was based on my looks and how I</text>
  <text start="2779.55" dur="5.52">looked and felt in front of the camera</text>
  <text start="2781.29" dur="5.82">so when I partied too much or I felt</text>
  <text start="2785.07" dur="3.87">like crap when I was bloating I used to</text>
  <text start="2787.11" dur="3.6">have digestive issues I didn&amp;#39;t know</text>

  <text start="2793.53" dur="4.02">tolerant everybody&amp;#39;s pasteurized milk</text>
  <text start="2795.03" dur="4.2">intolerant basically but the fact of the</text>
  <text start="2797.55" dur="3.24">matter is some people can digest it</text>
  <text start="2799.23" dur="3.18">better but anyhow I would look in the</text>
  <text start="2800.79" dur="3.48">mirror I gained some weight the agents</text>
  <text start="2802.41" dur="4.32">would be like oh honey you&amp;#39;re fat and so</text>
